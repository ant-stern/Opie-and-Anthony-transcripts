<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opens with the hosts – Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton – engaging in their typical brand of self-deprecating and often offensive humor, joking about past controversies and the show's chaotic nature.  The conversation quickly veers to a poorly executed robot first pitch at a Phillies game, prompting mockery of the Philly Phanatic and John Sterling's baseball commentary. A caller, Bobo, contributes a bizarre, sexually explicit song about his penis, which the hosts find highly amusing.  A missed Capitals-Rangers hockey game, due to one host's viewing of American Idol, leads to a discussion of the show's judges, including Simon Cowell's absence, and a contestant with Tourette's syndrome.  This segues into a series of Cowardly Lion impressions.

Personal anecdotes follow, with one host detailing his Time Warner Cable woes and a bizarre encounter with a building resident convinced of cable sabotage, and another recounting the chaotic delivery of his luggage after a trip, culminating in a high-speed car chase with an Aston Martin driver.  The discussion shifts to gas prices, political commentary on President Obama's oil policies, and experiences with hybrid taxi cabs.  A segment on Kenny, the show's driver, highlights his unusual calmness and the rare instance where he yelled "jerk off!" at a reckless cabbie. The hosts speculate on Kenny's personality and contrast his demeanor with their own experiences with New York City traffic and road rage.

Sam Roberts and Roland’s red carpet experiences at the Tribeca Film Festival are then detailed.  Their difficulties in getting interviews with celebrities are highlighted, contrasting the treatment of radio personalities with that of television personalities. The segment recounts a brief, bizarre interview with Elton John ("How are you with electronics?"), a chaotic encounter with "Hugo, the Strongest Man in the World" whose wife revealed marital problems involving breast-punching and ceiling fan-hurling, and the Olsen twins being booed by photographers.  Unsuccessful attempts to interview Scorsese, Steve Martin, and Anne Hathaway are mentioned, alongside a successful but underwhelming interview with Dennis Leary.  Norton gives away tickets to an Ozzy Osbourne documentary premiere. The discussion briefly touches on a reporter killed in Libya and criticism of the U.N. and Obama administration's handling of the Libyan conflict.

The show then transitions to a discussion of the American military's perceived weakening compared to World War II, followed by criticisms of presidential campaigning and campaign finance laws.  Norton shares a rambling, humorous anecdote about a daydream involving being shot and reviewing the lives of deceased celebrities and family members. This leads to a discussion of Artie Lange's absence.  A caller, Chris, provides more information about the journalist killed in Libya, furthering the discussion on US foreign policy.  The anticipated appearance of Larry King as a potentially confrontational guest is mentioned, alongside various other calls covering mortality, the Philadelphia Flyers, and the robot first pitch (again).  Weird Al Yankovic's "Perform This Way" parody is played and reviewed, with a caller, Eric, offering expert commentary.  Various Weird Al songs, including his polka medleys, are discussed, along with a discussion of John Valby and his lyrics.  Norton’s accidental spilling of chili on himself provides continuous off-color jokes, alongside recurring jokes about a listener named Tom potentially committing suicide.

The show continues with a discussion of a tweet praising Weird Al's concert from "Otto and George," leading to speculation about Otto's musical tastes. Anthony then launches into a rambling, nonsensical performance.  Otto calls in to explain his Weird Al enthusiasm, detailing the concert's costumes and entertainment value. He discusses other parody artists and recounts his own experience with Delta losing his luggage.  The conversation shifts to the movie *Poseidon Adventure*, comparing its emotional impact to *Titanic*, and leading to discussions of various actors, including Stella Stevens.  Otto shares a childhood fantasy and plugs his upcoming performance.  Bubuckley's performance at Foxwoods is mentioned, leading into the next segment.

Danielle Harris, the next guest, discusses her roles in the *Halloween* films and other horror movies, her work with Rob Zombie, and her upcoming film, *Steakland*.  She also recounts her experiences with a stalker, including voicemails and texts.  Anecdotes about Burt Reynolds and Bruce Willis are shared.  The conversation is filled with crude and sexually suggestive jokes.  Harris promotes *Steakland*, and the segment concludes with further jokes and banter.

The final segment features a female actress, referred to as "Halloween Gal" on Twitter.  The conversation begins with discussions about Twitter and Jim Norton's tweet, including a comment about their "creepy fucking boss."  Her Passover observance (or lack thereof) leads to jokes about Jewish people and their houses.  Her work at conventions like Comic-Con and Chiller Theater, and future projects at Big Apple Con, a “Weekend of Horrors” in Germany, and events in Australia are discussed.  Sexually suggestive listener tweets are read. The conversation covers her personal life and romantic preferences, leading to more sexually suggestive jokes.  She promotes *Steakland*.  She mentions upcoming appearances on *Chelsea Lately* and *Red Eye*.  The coincidence of her and Opie both being born in Plainview, Long Island, leads to final banter. The show concludes with the announcement of Wendell Pierce and another actor from *The Wire* as the next day's guests.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Reg Hughes, a father.  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Kumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up The Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cream style of entertainment  and having very few minutes.  Oh, my God. 
[00:00:30]  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts funny, and then it gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  The crazier, the better.  Yeah, yeah.  What, are you, 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show is on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go, fuck.  I have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime. 
[00:01:00]  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Morning.  Welcome to The Opie and Anthony Show.  They just showed robot baseball.  We should start with that, because they had the clip on TV.  Robot baseball is a bust.  That looks stupid.  We were the ones that talked about this a long time ago,  that eventually it will be robot baseball.  Yeah. 
[00:01:30]  And what?  They had a robot throw out the first pitch down there in Philly?  Didn't do a very good job.  Because I saw the Philly Fanatic.  Oh, that Philly Fanatic, by the way, is so funny.  The smelly suit.  Remember how bad that suit smelled?  Every time I go to a Phillies game, which is a few a year now,  that's all I think about is how bad that suit smelled.  Terrible.  When we were at YSP and he came in to promote something  and didn't talk the entire fucking time, which is great for radio.  But they just did robot baseball, and I think Ronnie B said it yesterday, 
[00:02:00]  it's just a pitching machine.  Yeah.  And so they bring the robot out to the pitcher's mound to throw out the first pitch.  First of all, it still needs a human to put the ball in its spatula fucking hand.  And then it bounced to home plate.  Yeah.  They can't even figure out how to get the robot thing to throw it all away?  That thing should be throwing 300-mile-an-hour pitches.  Why not?  300-mile-an-hour pitches.  It was lame.  It bounced a couple times before it got to home plate. 
[00:02:30]  Bounced to Philly Fanatic.  And then the Philly Fanatic, it was really funny,  gave the signal to bring in a new pitcher.  Oh, did he?  Yeah, yeah, as he went out to the mound.  Boom!  That was great.  Wow, yay.  So we don't have to worry about robots yet.  I wish an errant spark would hit his suit and just burst into flames.  They made it out of some flammable material.  I can't wait until robots start hitting home runs.  Just hopefully one will wind up on the Yankees.  That'll be good.  Domei Arigato!  No, Mr. Roboto! 
[00:03:00]  Did you think about that all night?  No, I just came in.  That's great.  That's pretty brilliant right there.  Thank you.  Warning, Will Robinson!  Fucking Sterling.  I heard Sterling's starting to do it for doubles and stuff now, too.  Oh, that fucking asshole!  Someone wrote me the other day and said,  John Sterling's now doing it for doubles, not just home runs.  Why?  That's retarded.  I don't know if we got an example of that, but we'll keep our ears open for that one. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, it is high!  Oh, beady, beady, beady!  He tweaked one!  Boo.  Boo is right.  Sorry.  Let's get this out of the way.  That's great.  Bobo.  Speaking of robots.  No one's home, but the one-man band plays on!  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No one's home.  No, no, Bobo.  No, no, we don't care about that.  Bobo, if no one's home, the one-man band doesn't play on. 
[00:04:00]  All right.  So we'll see you tomorrow.  That sucks.  Make sure everyone's home.  Tomorrow, everybody's going to be home tomorrow.  All right, then.  Bobo's one-man band is tomorrow.  You can't do the one-man band if no one's home.  I'm sorry.  No, no.  I'm sorry.  Doesn't worry about that.  I'm sorry.  Have a good day.  Everybody will be home tomorrow.  Goodbye, sir.  All right.  He's all excited.  Bobo.  He's all excited to play his one-man band to an empty house.  How does that work?  Doesn't he understand what this is about?  Yeah, he called in to the back office about 545 just to let everybody know that he was 
[00:04:30]  ready to call.  I thought he was ready to call.  He's so excited that you guys want to take his calls again, that he'll do anything for  it.  My dick.  My dick.  My tiny little dick.  I never got in late because my tiny little dick.  If you show your tip, my tiny little dick goes up and there was one time that Eric made me  come all watching gay porn. 
[00:05:00]  My dick.  My dick.  My tiny little dick.  When was that hit recorded?  Bobo wrote a song yesterday.  He wanted to sing it for us.  My dick.  There it is.  That's a good one.  Yeah, he wrote every word.  We had nothing to do with it.  That's going to be a hit.  Number one hit tune.  Fuck.  Hey, I missed a great hockey game last night because my sister was visiting, so we turned  on American Idol.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:05:30]  And you might say, well, do you have more than one TV?  Yes, of course I have more than one TV, but it was kind of like that.  You know, you're kind of socializing.  Let's put a program on.  Oh.  Fucking the Capitals-Rangers game.  You hear about this game?  Two overtimes?  Rangers were leading three zip in the third, and then the Capitals come all the way back,  and then it makes it to two overtimes.  Like, if you like hockey, this is the type of game you want to see.  And instead, I'm watching Steven Tyler, Jennifer Lopez, and Randy Jackson. 
[00:06:00]  Well, you would have seen this year's history in the making because, obviously, the Rangers,  the last team that was undefeated after leading after two periods, and now they've lost that  one last night.  Is that what happened?  Eliminating that record from the blah, blah, blah.  Well, it was for this season.  They were the last team to, if they were leading after two, they won every time.  Oh, really?  It was a ding-dong time, except last night.  Well, the Capitals beat the Rangers 4-3 in the second overtime. 
[00:06:30]  God, I can't believe I missed that.  Yeah.  Because then I'm watching American Idol, then I got to crash.  But I was telling Sam and Ant before the show, stupid Steven Tyler, Jennifer Lopez, and  Randy Jackson, just my two cents.  Yeah.  Doing a really good job with this American Idol.  Are you digging the show?  I'm not going to be all in.  I mean, I watched a few seasons, definitely, and then I faded out somewhere, but, you  know, I happened to watch it last night, and they do all right.  Yeah, I haven't even, I can't. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, I'm not trying to sell it.  I'm not trying to get more viewers or anything like that.  It's more relaxing, because Simon's not there to beat up a little innocent kid for trying  to fucking sing a song properly.  Just trying to sing a song and have a little fun and make something out of his life, a hope,  a dream, yeah, and no one just watched it smashed.  I don't know.  It was comfortable to watch, although I like Simon, and I think the X Factor's going to  just destroy Idol when it finally hits, but that's what I watched last night. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  Fucking American Idol.  Is that it?  And there's some kid with Tourette's.  What?  He, like, with his face.  Is he all, like, twitchy and, like, fucking, rah.  But then when he sings, he doesn't have to do that, so.  Yeah, that's a weird thing, that Tourette's.  I don't get that.  Some people could sing, and they're fine.  Yeah.  He could sing without going, like, rah, rah, rah.  Yeah.  But he wasn't, I didn't see him make any noises, just really uncomfortable faces.  Like, something was being thrown at him at all times. 
[00:08:00]  He was flinching.  See, this is my, I don't even know these people, but I guess he's the rocker this year.  And he just makes this face, unless he's singing.  Wouldn't you just go through life singing?  Yeah.  Because it's really uncomfortable to see this.  Yeah.  Constantly.  I've seen people that could play guitar and play drums and shit like that, and then they  stop, and they're just all, wah, wah, Tourette-y.  You know, or they do a wonderful impression from The Wizard of Oz of the Cowardly Lion. 
[00:08:30]  Jesus.  The greatest Tourette's guy ever, right?  Lewis?  Lewis Twitchell's, uh, Santani.  Santani is the greatest Tourette's guy ever.  Uh, Dorothy, uh-huh.  Oh, God.  Put him up.  Put him up.  What a douche chill that is.  Put him up.  Lewis Twitchell Santani doing The Cowardly Lion.  Where is he doing it now?  I don't even know.  Hopefully in a fucking rave.  Do we have video of that?  That was a great impression.  Uh, it gives me such douche chills. 
[00:09:00]  Put him up.  It's such douche chills.  No, I think it's good.  No, I think it's a great impression.  I, especially when he does multiple characters from the movie.  It's just amazing.  Okay.  Oh, is that it?  I'm so sorry.  You're leaving it anymore.  It's beautiful.  Oh, yeah, oh, and I.  I'm about to cry.  I'm about to cry.  You.  I'm about to cry.  I'm about to cry.  I'm about to cry.  I'm about to cry.  I'm about to cry.  You know how hard I, I, I, I just wanted to push him out that fucking window. 
[00:09:30]  Really?  And watch him just plummet.  There's only five floors, Anthony, I'll build it.  Oh, is that it?  Why does he, why does he bother you so much?  I don't know.  He's got, he's just so annoying.  Life, uh, life, you know.  Want to dealt him some shit?  I want to dealt him some shitty cards.  Join the club.  You can understand.  Fuck him.  Join the club?  You weren't dealt shitty cards.  Yeah, we all have.  Look at your life. 
[00:10:00]  We all have a couple of shitty cards in our deck.  Yeah, but then when you see someone like that, you go.  His whole deck is shit.  You go, my cards aren't as shitty.  Well, yeah.  That's what I think.  I beat his hand, but you know, there are other hands I'm not going to beat.  Then I start thinking my two cards off suit aren't as bad as his two cards off suit.  Yeah, you know.  But, uh.  He just was annoying to me.  I could never fucking.  Yeah.  He did some good shit for us, though.  Hey, uh.  You're not a fan of Muse, are you?  Uh.  No, actually I am. 
[00:10:30]  I'm not.  You're starting to get into Muse?  As far as that kind of music goes, they're all right.  Because the Tourette's Kid did Uprising from Muse last night?  Holy shit.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I'll say holy shit to that.  Was it good?  Yeah, it was good.  Yeah.  And I don't know how he got his voice so fucking high.  Because.  Really?  Yeah.  That song gets a bit.  Do you falsetto it?  A bit high.  Or falsetto?  He took it to the fucking limit.  I don't know.  Maybe we could get that performance.  Because you might appreciate it. 
[00:11:00]  You appreciate a good vocalist, right?  Of course.  Love a good vocalist.  Oh, and really fast.  Yesterday, you know, because I love my Time Warner.  And, you know, it was time to get on my rickety stool to reset my internet.  Ah, yeah.  Reset that internet.  Which I do every fucking day.  Well, that's part of having Time Warner.  Every day.  It's got to be wonderful.  And then realize that my cable box was two and a half hours behind.  You know, isn't that impossible? 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  It's like, doesn't it just.  Think about it.  And then I reset the cable box and it was still two and a half hours behind.  And I'm thinking that's got to be impossible.  What the fuck?  So then I go downstairs because I was going for a bike ride.  And, you know, every building has a guy behind the desk.  And he was talking to some woman.  So I go, hey, you know, is the cable out in the building?  And he goes, yeah, I'll put you on the list.  And this, just saying that, this woman decided that she needed to talk to me. 
[00:12:00]  I'll tell you why the cable's out.  Oh, she jumped in.  This is why I hate living in a building in New York City, by the way.  I want a fucking house in the middle of nowhere.  What are you in the Budinsky building?  Yeah.  I'm like, I wasn't talking to you.  Yeah.  But I'm being polite because I'm not on the fucking radio.  And she's like, I'll tell you what the deal is.  They're purposely fucking up our cable in this building because they all want us to change over to Fios.  I know for a fact that's what they're doing. 
[00:12:30]  And then she mentioned some weird cable company.  She goes, we used to have this cable company.  They did the same thing to get us all to switch over to Time Warner.  And now they're doing it because they all want us to have Fios.  And what is she, what's her problem with Fios?  She doesn't like the Fios.  I don't know.  Doesn't have it.  I don't know.  Who's that?  Sorry.  Who's the other one's Fios?  What happened?  Where were you?  I was looking at Fios.  What happened to you?  I'm looking at this amazing article by Andrea Peiser.  Go ahead.  Is it a good article for the show? 
[00:13:00]  Phenomenal, yeah.  I mean, I love the show.  You're starting to like her, huh?  Yeah, I am because she's just a fucking bitch.  But I like what she wrote here.  But it's not good for the show.  No, no.  It's who?  I said behind the counter, you know, you have a guy in your building.  And I just want to know why my cable was out.  He goes, yeah, it's something happening in the building today.  And that this woman decides she needed to tell me why she thinks the cable's out.  And that the building is in cahoots with the Fios people.  Oh, okay.  And they're purposely fucking up some of the shit in the basement.  So we all lose our cable. 
[00:13:30]  And we get so frustrated that we finally go.  That you go to Fios.  All right, that's it.  Fios.  Because they've had the literature in the lobby.  And you see the Fios truck outside our buildings every day, right, Jimmy?  Yes, you do.  And you see them in the hallway.  And every time I want to celebrate somebody's great decision.  I don't want to change.  And as much as, you know, I hated this woman, it did get me thinking a little bit.  I'm like, no, I wonder if there is some kind of cahoots going on between the building manager and the Fios people.  Maybe he gets a little something something. 
[00:14:00]  The same as he was probably getting from cable.  Dude, cable has been so bad for so long.  Even if they are in cahoots, I had to constantly reset my fucking box.  There was always problems.  The internet blew.  I was always getting kicked offline.  I've had a couple of minor problems with Fios, but nothing like I did with cable.  The quality is better.  And I have no interest in saying that.  I'm paying full price for it.  It's just better.  Cable stinks, dude.  But finally, the cable went back just in time to watch American Idol.  Thank God.  But it fucking, all that. 
[00:14:30]  Anthony fucking, Anthony was the guinea pig.  And I mean, it was just from lifestyle.  Of course.  And I fucking jumped on, dude.  You have two people here who are telling you Fios is great.  I like resetting my cable box every day.  Or the internet, mostly.  It's mostly the internet.  Who wouldn't?  I love doing that.  Get up on the rickety stool.  Yeah, I just need to ask about that.  Because I was thinking about this the other day.  Why are you getting up on a step stool?  Because I know it bothers you guys. 
[00:15:00]  That's why I kept my BlackBerry for so long.  Why was something installed near the ceiling?  Yeah.  Why wasn't it lowered to the close of the floor?  Because I got this big, over-the-top entertainment fucking center that was built in, nice, custom-made  before I got there.  And I want to rip the whole fucking thing out.  I'll save you some room.  Yeah.  Because the TV's low.  Because in my head, someone just screwed a cable modem to the ceiling.  You know?  Yeah.  It is high.  It's probably...  It is high. 
[00:15:30]  My ceilings are about 10 feet, so it's about 8, 8 1⁄2 feet up.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I'm on a stool, and then I'm reaching just to fucking reset my internet.  Did you unplug your bar?  Did you plug it back in?  Oh, and I see a Time Warner guy in the building, and I tell him about my internet problem.  And he goes, well, didn't you call customer service?  I go, customer service?  Stop.  I know the drill. 
[00:16:00]  I go, I can't get any of you fuckers.  I said fuckers, too.  This guy.  I can't get any of you fuckers on the line.  Like, I know the drill.  I don't feel like being on hold for two hours.  I'd rather reset my internet every day.  Of course.  That's what I decided in my head.  I'd rather do that than deal with, you know, waiting for a service, waiting to get a live  person, first of all, if you can figure your way through the whole system with the push  one for this, push two for this, push three for this, and then wait for this, and then  all of a sudden you go back to the beginning because you did something wrong. 
[00:16:30]  Fuck that.  So I said, no, I haven't called you people because I don't feel like dealing with that.  I'd rather reset.  You gotta get the files.  Yeah, I'll get there.  It is the greatest.  I'll get there.  Just the greatest.  Finally got my last piece of luggage.  Oh, yeah.  So leave that shit.  Haven't you been home a week already?  Leave that shit.  Yeah.  Well, they shipped my luggage over to my mother and Sal's house.  Oh, well, that's smart.  And then they shipped one of mom and Sal's bags over to my house. 
[00:17:00]  And God only knows where Keith's bags are.  It really is astounding how ridiculous it is.  When you go to the airport for baggage, your tickets, everything, you hand over more fucking  forms of identification and bullshit, right?  Yeah.  Yet they don't know where the fuck you live.  Nope.  And where your bags are or anything like that. 
[00:17:30]  Wait a minute.  Didn't I give you every bit of...  I can't even step into the airport without giving you all kinds of identification.  At every corner, there's somebody else asking for your passport, your driver's license, your  ticket, everything else.  Mm-hmm.  And you don't know where the fuck I live or where my bags are or anything?  It's a horrible business plan.  Oh, it's horrible.  Because didn't they have to make three stops to get your luggage to your house?  Oh, my God.  Or two.  It was three. 
[00:18:00]  Two or three.  And then...  Three separate people came to your house with luggage?  Yes.  That's a horrible business plan.  Three separate people.  And one of them was wrong because it was my mother and Sal's.  So they obviously hire people full-time to just get luggage to people.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That is just...  And then they have to go to the same house more than once?  More than once.  That business would never survive.  No.  Anywhere else.  And then I had to instill to Sal.  I had to tell him, look, Sal, no matter what bags they give you, keep them. 
[00:18:30]  Because he would have been like, that's not my bag.  And then sent mine back.  Back into the maze.  I saw the guy that brought Sal's bag to my house.  I was like, oh, yeah, I'll take that.  Because, you know, once they take it, they don't throw it back in the van and then drive it to the correct house.  Right.  They go back to the airport.  And then it goes on the pile of shit that goes into...  It's the no-one-was-home-here pile of shit.  Yeah, you start over.  And you start from scratch on that motherfucker. 
[00:19:00]  So I was like, look, I got your bag.  I go, whatever happens, just take the fucking bag.  Sure.  So we did that.  And then I had to drive out there...  To switch bags.  To switch bags, which is kind of a trip down the expressway last night for me.  But it gave me the opportunity to give the old Shelby a little shakedown after finally getting it back.  Right.  Because the weather was nice.  It wasn't cold.  I let the tires and everything heat up.  I did a couple of burnouts there to get them all nice and sticky. 
[00:19:30]  Did you get pulled over?  No, I didn't get pulled over, but...  That LIE, man.  You can't fucking do anything anymore.  There's cops everywhere.  Oh, I know.  There's, well, sheriffs in Suffolk County.  They got sheriff's patrol in that.  And that's all they do.  So they're there all the time.  And then there's the Nassau cops on the Nassau section.  But you got to, you know, you keep your eyes peeled.  You kind of look.  You pick your spots to jump on it.  And I think something's wrong with my speedometer. 
[00:20:00]  Because it was showing me going a lot faster than I think I was going.  Like, I...  Like, the rest of the traffic wasn't going by me...  Like, you know, I wasn't going by them fast enough.  Right, right, right.  So you think, wait, they tell you that they're fucking supercharged at the engine,  but they're really just fucking jacking your speedometer?  Jacking my speedometer.  I'm doing 170, and you're just barely passing someone doing 60.  At one point, I, like, I got up to, like, it was 100.  It said 120. 
[00:20:30]  Why are you doing that?  But I don't think I was.  So what, are you doing 118?  What are you doing?  No, I think it was 100.  But it wasn't 120.  Why?  But I got to know how fast I'm going.  No, you don't.  Because it was the first time I drove it,  and I wanted to make sure, like, it still had the power to it.  What are you doing?  Then I'm driving home, and this little fucking, you know, I'm just driving.  I'm being nice.  This little Aston Martin comes, like, blasting by me,  and then kind of starts slowing down a little bit. 
[00:21:00]  And I'm like, oh.  He wants to play.  I'm like, oh, no.  He wants to play.  Like, oh, no.  So I fucking downshift and goose it and take off, and he takes off.  And I fucking, like a faggot, I just blow a gear.  I miss a gear.  And he just gets pat.  And it felt so, like, humiliating.  Why?  Because I miss the fucking gear.  What did you do after?  Did you drive by Arnold's for a burger and go to Inspiration Point?  Did you grow up? 
[00:21:30]  What else is there to do, though?  Just stop it.  Why is it great?  What, were you on your way to the hop, and you had a drag race with fucking Kenickie  or whoever the fuck else is in that awful movie?  We were racing for pinks.  That's so ridiculous.  Why is it ridiculous?  Because he's fucking a grown-up, almost 45 years old.  Almost.  But these days are starting to feel the same.  You've got to do something.  How about, here's a sound he should never, he's got a fucking, a $10 million mansion,  a fucking high profile.  How about you stop? 
[00:22:00]  Stop it.  I don't like that sound.  No, take a gentleman's ride.  But it's nice.  It was, uh...  So he kicked your ass because you missed the gear?  Yeah, yeah.  So he blasted past me, and I knew I had him, but...  Was it like having a soft noodle when you need a hard one?  Yep.  That's how it felt.  I was like, shit.  The second you miss a gear and you kind of look down at the shifter real quick, and you're  just like...  Yeah, well. 
[00:22:30]  I don't know why this made me laugh.  I'm going to try it, though.  Spectro from Michigan.  Is Aston Martin, Steve Martin's spoiled little daughter?  I don't know.  Yes, I just passed her.  That made me laugh.  I told her father stunk.  Thank you, Spectro.  Yeah.  Aston Martin sounds like Steve Martin's mother.  Ah, stop.  Chip.  And people are noticing we've said cahoots way too...  It's too many times.  I hate that word.  I know.  We're all in cahoots.  It's one of those fucking words I don't like, but I'm going to say it a lot now. 
[00:23:00]  Sounds like a black girl's name.  Yeah.  Does it?  No.  Cahoots?  No, it wasn't racing flea in a pickup truck.  Do you have a radar jammer people want to know?  No.  Does that shit work anymore?  Rookie.  Remember you had to keep up with all that stuff when we were growing up?  Oh, my God.  They made so many different types of radar.  And we all knew a guy that knew what to do.  Yeah.  I wonder how much of that was bullshit.  Oh, crap.  Just having a radar detector when you first had it. 
[00:23:30]  Because I did a lot of trips from here to western New York.  And, man, when that thing just beeped a little and you knew something was up ahead.  I'm going way back, obviously.  Yeah.  What a great feeling.  And then you saw them.  You're like, ah, ah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I liked it when you saw them.  I hated the 80 other times it went off when you didn't see shit.  No, this is the early days.  And then their equipment got better.  And then it was kind of like an arms race.  I don't know where it's at at this point.  I don't know.  When they're just shooting it at you.  Yeah, this was way before that where it was a constant signal, right? 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  Well, that guy brings up a great point.  Where do you want to go?  Use my...  Well, I don't even think we have to go to him.  But it's brilliant.  Use my GPS to check out my speed.  Nah, you had to be going 120.  See if I'm going...  I don't think I was.  Because, okay, at one point, a sheriff had someone pulled over, right?  And we're all going past him.  I mean, you know how people get by something pulled over?  Everybody, according to my speedometer, was doing 80 miles an hour past this fucking... 
[00:24:30]  Ah, yeah.  Yeah, something's amiss with my speedo.  There's no way.  Yeah.  Because they slow down to 55.  Yuppers.  Double nickels.  I know.  They go crazy.  They go cray-cray.  Remember when they gave us those cars at N.E.W.?  What was it?  Remember we got them for a weekend?  And you never gave yours back?  Didn't they give you guys, like, Lexuses?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, but at the time...  Yeah, they had to actually repo mine.  Yeah, they actually fucking got mad at it and finally...  And I took mine skiing and I almost put mine in a ditch. 
[00:25:00]  It was the worst I did.  You were doing donuts in the snow in the governor's parking lot?  Yeah, the governor's comedy club.  And the cop pulled me over?  Yeah.  But it was all set up by...  No, it wasn't set up.  The guy happened to be a fan of the show and decided he was going to bust my balls.  It was right after a John Valby show.  Yeah.  Yeah, I was doing some...  That parking lot is nice and big and when it's all iced over, you can get some shit done.  But what I was going to say is I took that thing out east and I got it up to...  I don't want to exaggerate, but it was over 100, 110. 
[00:25:30]  I didn't...  I'll admit it.  I hated it.  Really?  Fucking...  You like going that fast?  Yeah.  You have to concentrate way too much or something.  You're like totally fucking like...  Just tunnel vision.  Brr.  I wanted to see how brave it was and how fast I could get it up to.  And around 110, I was like, all right, that's enough.  It wasn't for me, man.  Yeah.  And I know people are now laughing because there's guys out there that love that, but...  No, that's fucking fine.  Don't you feel like you have to have just complete and utter concentration when you're 
[00:26:00]  going that fast?  Yeah, that's the cool part.  And the sound is just like...  Supercharges going.  It just sounds like Mad Max.  Because when you're doing 70, you could be texting and you could turn all the way around.  70 is the new 50.  It's easy.  You don't even think twice when you're going 70.  Yeah.  You could do a lot of other shit.  Yeah.  But at 100, 110, 120 like you might have been doing yesterday, you can't do anything else  extra.  No, you got to just...  And you got to pick your spots.  You can't even blink. 
[00:26:30]  You can't do that.  You can't be weaving in and out of traffic doing that shit.  You need a nice straight stretch where it's just, you know, you look around, no cops.  And then you hit it for a little bit.  You give it a little...  And if you have a car that can get up to speed really quick, then you don't have to worry  that the time it's taking you to get up to a high speed is the time you're vulnerable  for cops and shit like that and accidents and stuff.  I did like that when you had that gas and you were up to a ridiculous speed within no 
[00:27:00]  time.  What's gas up to out there?  I literally went through, I think, half a tank of gas from my house to my mom's, which  is probably...  How many miles would you say?  20 miles, maybe.  Maybe 30.  Half a tank of gas?  Half a tank of gas to go 30 miles.  That's a lot of gas.  Yes.  It's crazy.  Because it's just...  Every time you hear...  You just know there's like... 
[00:27:30]  You might as well just be pouring a fucking gallon of gas down into your engine.  But it's pushing five bucks, right?  Yeah.  And you're saying maybe we might see six dollars.  You know what it is, though?  Let me tell you something.  Every time...  And I know the gas is going up.  And it is at five bucks a gallon in places.  Four and way up there change.  Four and change.  I think in D.C. that one station was already at five bucks a gallon.  Because what?  They wanted to be the guy?  They wanted to be the guy.  They wanted to be the guy that got the news story. 
[00:28:00]  Does that get the...  Yeah.  But every time it hits another dollar amount, they go, we could see.  And then they go to the next dollar amount.  Right.  And things happen.  Who knows?  Yeah, but gas always goes up in time for summer.  And we're not at summer yet.  And if gas is up to four...  What's the average right now?  Let's say 470, maybe?  Fucking Christ.  Well, no.  Around here, it's like 430, I think.  430?  What's the national average?  Can you look that up?  It's probably about 405.  That's what it is.  Around here.  So why are we paying so much more around here? 
[00:28:30]  Around here where?  Like in the city?  I paid four...  There's like two gas stations.  No, no, no.  I was out on Long Island over the weekend.  Demand, though.  I think I paid 450.  If you're out in the middle of the sticks, you know, there ain't as many cars.  Maybe you paid credit.  I think cash price is always going to be a little less.  What did I pay?  Yeah, I did pay credit, and it was full service because it was rent.  Oh, yeah.  And it was super, full service, no credit.  I go just fucking regular unleaded.  Get the fuck out of here.  I got it.  I'm not going to have my car long enough for it to matter. 
[00:29:00]  I put the super in.  Yeah, put the super.  That's how I always looked at it.  I never care about gas because I use so little of it living in the city.  It's like it may make a $10 or $12 difference when I fill up.  I don't have to fill up that often, which I'm lucky, but it's like people that kind of drive in.  I mean, that just sucks.  Do you know all fucking Obama has to do is say, I'm going to lift some restrictions on some refineries.  We're going to lift some restrictions.  We're going to do some exploratory drilling. 
[00:29:30]  Just say it.  Just fucking say it.  Because you know how the public reacts, and the news would jump all over it,  and then the fucking price would come down.  Absolutely guarantee you the price would fucking come down.  But he won't even fucking say it.  Never mind, do it.  How about you fucking just start lifting some of these restrictions?  Because he's the worst president ever, right?  Oh, God, he is.  How about this, though?  Yes, he is. 
[00:30:00]  People are starting to look towards fucking hybrids.  Hybrids are, there's a lot of the cabs are hybrids.  When they're not bursting into flames in your garage.  Well, that would be a bad thing.  It was nice, the vault.  Somebody bought a vault, and it just apparently burst into flames in his garage.  I still want to see fucking alternate technologies.  It's time.  But when I'm in a cab, and it's silent, and then every stoplight, the whole thing turns off,  that's creepy.  You get used to it.  It sounds like it's stalling out.  Let's be honest.  I like a hybrid unless there are five black guys on the corner. 
[00:30:30]  Then I'm like, you got it, got it.  Oh, I thought it stalled.  No, but it's like a golf cart.  You step on a golf cart gas pedal, and it goes, and then you take your foot off, and  it just stops.  That's a good car for New York.  That's what the cabs are doing.  Yeah, yeah.  They're like golf carts now.  They stop at the lights, and everything shuts down.  It's really weird.  Oh, I'm proud to announce that Kenny showed some emotion this morning.  Club soda?  Club soda Kenny finally showed emotion. 
[00:31:00]  Did someone die, and he was all happy about it?  Yeah, that's the only emotion I could figure.  At 5, 5.15 in the morning in Manhattan, the cabs are out of control because they're  so desperate for fares.  They don't give a fuck who's on the street.  Oh, I know.  I've seen that.  And I've seen them.  There's one road we go down.  It's three lanes.  The cab came from the right, all the way to the right side, in front of Kenny, swooping  like this.  Everyone jammed on their brakes because he's trying to get a fare all the way on the left.  I fucking hate when they do that.  It's unbelievable.  I fucking hate them. 
[00:31:30]  That's how badly they need fares at that time in the morning.  They don't give a fuck who's behind them.  Yeah.  And Kenny actually showed emotion, slowed down as the guy's picking up the fare, rolled  down his window, and went, jerk off!  And then pulled away.  He just yelled, jerk off.  That's it.  Did the guy hear him?  Oh, yeah.  I will always lead with a racial epithet.  Well, me and Jimmy have been in the car with Kenny, and you see some shit going down,  and it doesn't faze Kenny ever.  He won't fucking beep.  I'm like, would you honk? 
[00:32:00]  Stop trying to be stealthy.  Do something for us.  Do something.  Stop trying to be stealthy.  He's always trying to be stealthy.  It's like a guy cuts him off.  Humility cuckolds him.  Right.  Kenny's a fucking...  You know what he is?  He's a vehicle cuckold.  Right.  Somebody cuts him off, and he just takes his foot off and lets them go.  Yeah.  It's like, you're a fucking killer.  How about you just honk?  It's unbelievable.  Yeah, because if you have a body like Kenny, he's what?  6'6", 2...  He's 6'4", 245, 11 IQ, tiny head. 
[00:32:30]  You know what?  You could get done with that.  Exactly.  You wouldn't even get a lot of time in prison because they know you were a dummy.  Yeah, it's slow.  He didn't realize his own strength.  He just wanted to pet the hair of the cabbie.  God, I wish I could be that guy.  I would be beating up people all the way home every day.  I guess...  I would be throwing people through windows.  For some reason, he's even-keeled.  Like, he doesn't...  It's unbelievable.  Kenny does not freak out.  Where do you think that comes out, though?  Because you gotta...  You gotta get that out.  When he's jerking off.  I think Kenny jerks off furiously. 
[00:33:00]  Like, I think his dick probably has, like, fuck...  It's shaved.  It looks like it has eczema, but that's just because he rips the skin off angrily.  Jesus.  Eczema.  Kenny's seboria.  Fucking A, man.  You are so right.  I've never heard that before.  Bravo to Danny.  Kenny's head is shaped like Bert from Sesame Street.  Oh, man.  We gotta fuck...  That's Kenny!  Holy shit!  Even the eyebrows almost.  Kenny looks like Bert.  He really does.  I never realized that.  Kenny doesn't have the uni-brow, but close enough, man. 
[00:33:30]  He could.  Fuck.  But he did yell jerk-off today, so...  Jerk-off?  I was happy.  Did he shake his fist?  Well, then he...  And then...  Oh, and then there's another cab that beeped at him, and that would just throw me off.  I would have to do something.  Yeah.  He goes, oh, what are you gonna do?  Some people are always in a hurry.  Oh, yes.  That's...  It's called life.  That's what we deal with.  It drives me...  How many times have I said, excuse me, and I actually honk it?  I'm like, the guy's doing fucking three. 
[00:34:00]  You beep his horn at other people.  You don't know how many times we're on the road, and I will actually lean over and go,  excuse me.  I always say, excuse me, and then I fucking jam on his horn.  Yeah.  Stop thinking he'd get ten of these.  Does he laugh at you?  Nothing.  He just...  No.  No, why wouldn't he show an emotion?  He doesn't show emotion.  It's the creepiest thing ever.  But he did say jerk-off today, and...  Jerk-off?  I admire that, though, because I'm telling you, that Kenny will not fucking have a heart attack.  Kenny handles that shit well.  His stress level is probably very low, but then he swallows it. 
[00:34:30]  You think he's swallowing it, yeah.  Yeah, maybe.  No, man, they say it's good to fucking get it out.  There's a balance, though, because I get it out, and I'm not happy.  Then again, he does it, and he's not happy.  Like I was saying before, I always lead with a racial epithet when a cab driver fucks me over.  Because I know...  I don't have time for things to escalate with a cab argument.  I'm on the road.  We're driving.  I know he's going somewhere.  I'm going somewhere.  So when he fucks with me, when any cab driver fucks with me, I have to go to the hardest thing I can get him with. 
[00:35:00]  So it's always, you know, some kind of ethnicity or the fact that, you know, I'll yell things out at him.  And it gets him really annoyed.  Yeah.  Really annoyed.  Fuck you.  Fuck you, my friend.  Fuck you.  They get so pissed.  Hey, was your Mustang set to kilometers?  Someone wants to know.  No, it wasn't.  I was making sure of that.  And we got a guy that's... 
[00:35:30]  Oh, is someone going to help me out?  Well, her husband works for Mustang.  Kim in Jersey.  What's up, Kim?  Right?  Yes.  My husband builds Mustangs for quarter-mile drag racing down at Englishtown.  Yeah.  Did you have any work done on the rear?  Did you have the gears changed?  Yeah, but it was after that, after they fixed it up, after I kind of, you know, tapped a guardrail, and they had to fix it.  A lot of people don't know that when they change the gears in the rear, there is a Dominic gear that's available that's comparable to it. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, I might have to...  Also, if you change the size of the tires with the supercharger, all these little things can tweak the actual speed of...  All the speed of speedometer's measuring is how many times the wheel comes around in a complete circle.  Yeah, yeah, I got you.  If you're tweaking it to small amounts...  I hate hearing chicks talk about cars.  Thank you, Ms., for straightening Anthony out.  I'm so happy she knows more about this than you do, and she does.  Thank you, madam.  When I'm calling a real mechanic, can you make the coffee? 
[00:36:30]  Jesus, she doesn't want to help you.  Thanks for my eggs.  She's just trying to help.  It's burnt.  I have straightened out.  Thank you, ma'am.  All right, Kim, thank you.  Kenny, what was the exact thing you said to the other cabbie, not the jerk-off thing, which I was proud of today, because you showed some emotion.  Remember the other one that was right behind us beeping, getting all pissed off?  And what was the exact word?  Some people are in such a hurry or something like that. 
[00:37:00]  Do you remember?  No, I'm sorry.  I don't remember.  That's fine.  No worries.  Were you really mad when the guy cut you off?  I think he did it for me.  Exactly.  Because he doesn't get mad.  Otherwise, you wouldn't let it go.  Yes, of course he would.  Like, you know, it was a jerk-off move.  You know, he went across four lanes of traffic to try to get a fair.  Oh, you want a fucking broadside.  And not only that, on such a sharp fucking angle.  It was unbelievable.  I've seen it. 
[00:37:30]  Another car jammed on his brakes that was in the lane that he was eventually trying to get to.  Yeah.  And then stopped on an angle in that lane, so now the guy behind him had to completely stop so he could get this fair.  But you did it for me, right?  Yeah, because, like, the first indiscretion I let go, so I couldn't let two go without defending, you know, your honor.  My honor.  He just doesn't want to hear it from me and Jimmy, so I think he does it for us now.  But he doesn't beep.  Nothing bothers him. 
[00:38:00]  He doesn't beep when they fucking cut us off.  How many times have I leaned over and used your fucking horn for it?  He's laughing now.  I service his arm.  Yeah.  Next car I buy, I'm going to have a dual steering wheel.  So he has a horn on his side.  Yeah, I don't even need the wheel.  Just put a little button for a horn.  Like an ahoga.  Just something that makes me feel like...  Ahoga.  Yeah, those awful words.  The old school, yeah.  We're like fucking George and Lenny.  It's like, he's just a good-natured big goof, and I'm the fucking little creep with the fucking height complex. 
[00:38:30]  You know what's really terrific?  What?  Getting stuck in traffic with Jimmy.  Oh, because he must love it.  Oh, man.  I mean, like, you know, getting stuck in traffic is bad enough.  I can imagine.  How bad are you, Jimmy?  Horrendous.  Kenny's laughing at that.  I just repeat myself.  He has a short fuse.  But in those situations, there's nothing you can do.  You've got to just fucking deal with it.  I do, by just bitching and complaining and boring everybody. 
[00:39:00]  Kenny, you're free to speak.  What does he do?  He's out of his fucking mind.  Let me guess.  Is it things like, like, look at this guy, why isn't he moving?  Every two seconds.  What the fuck?  Look at the space he's leaving.  Don't you hate when they leave space and another car pulls in?  More than I hate rape.  Yes. 
[00:39:30]  And then they'll tell you things like, it's just one more car length, but then they'll  be slow again and another car goes in and another.  And before you know it, you're 20 car lengths back where you would have been.  Don't let a car cut Jimmy off.  I got to be right on the bumper.  Right on it.  But I am right.  I am right, though, because I practice.  I practice what I preach.  When I'm driving in traffic, I don't sit there and fucking text and let five car lengths  go.  And then look up and go, oh, what did I do? 
[00:40:00]  Because what's happening is these selfish cocksuckers are wasting mine and everybody  else's time by not paying attention.  And I fuck.  If we were all standing in line in the supermarket and it was the line was moving and they were  just looking down and they're like, oh, and then you were an extra 20 minutes, you'd fucking  be angry.  You'd freak out.  Yeah.  I can't fucking stand it.  And you know what else about the cabs that I fucking want to choke them?  See how quickly I turned the whole room?  Yes.  You're on one of these fucking little side streets going across town, whatever, and 
[00:40:30]  the cab's in front of you and you know you see the light screen, but it's a block away  and the don't walk thing is flashing.  So you know you're going to miss the light if this cab doesn't move fast.  His dome light's on.  He's doing his dumb, savage paperwork as he's fucking doing three miles an hour.  I'm right on his ass.  And then he gives me the shit when we both get stuck at the light and I pull up next  to him.  He's like, where are you going?  Where do you need to be? 
[00:41:00]  Fuck you.  As Anthony is saying this, I'm getting angry.  It's infuriating.  Why do we not?  Here's the thing.  Even though we're both technically right, Kenny handles it better.  That's the way you should be.  And what about fucking potholes?  That's good if you smoke a pot or something right there in the hole for you.  I knew that one was coming.  Did you?  I said it already.  They decided not to do the potholes this year, obviously. 
[00:41:30]  Why would they?  Why would they?  They're too busy building fucking bike lanes.  So if you have a fucking seat with a dildo sewn onto it, you can fucking aim for the potholes.  I hate that fucking sissy mayor.  It's unbelievable.  I really think that we should waste more money.  I really think that we should just build these things and kill traffic because I don't need  to be in it.  Did it even sound like him?  I don't know.  That's his soul.  The potholes are fucking brutal, man.  Disgusting.  But it's unbelievable how bad they are.  Build the bike lanes.  Put fucking potted plants up all over it.  That's what we need in the city. 
[00:42:00]  You can't drive anywhere.  Irrelevant asphalt, man.  We should get some of our taxes back, don't you think, if they're not going to fix the  potholes?  Yeah, they'll do that in a second.  Doesn't it work both ways?  No?  It should, right?  Basic services.  Fucking get it done.  We should take a break.  Am I bad in traffic?  Oh, my gosh.  No, you are right.  You have to notice I drive separately now.  Oh, my gosh.  James is right.  Thank you.  I don't like the way he winds himself up.  It's not good for him. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah?  Is that the problem you have?  The only problem you have with him doing that?  Yeah, I'm concerned for him.  Yeah, yeah.  It's very stressful, Jimmy.  I understand.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Listen, Sam and Roland were on the red carpet last night, and they got some really good  audio, and Sam got the greatest one-question interview ever.  Really?  Yeah, I'm not even kidding.  Big star?  Big, huge star.  Like, as far as stars go, from one to ten, how well-known is this star worldwide? 
[00:43:00]  I would have to give it a ten, Anthony.  Wow.  It's a ten.  I would have to give it a ten.  A ten!  And this is not a little twist on the Opie and Anthony show.  Right, right.  Sam actually got a one-question interview with a ten, as far as the celebrity meter goes.  That's a celebrity on the line of, like, Tom Cruise.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And stuff.  Yeah.  All right.  And there's a story behind it, and it pissed off the person and everybody else.  Well, why wouldn't it?  Roland and Sam got everyone in a tizzy down on the red carpet at the Tribeca, what, film 
[00:43:30]  festival?  Oh, Tribeca.  Then this has to be huge.  And leading up to the big one-question interview is a lot of just bullshit.  Crapola?  Crapola.  Nice.  But stories behind it.  All right.  Because no one would stop because it says fucking radio on our mic flags.  Ugh.  No one wants to talk to radio guys.  It's embarrassing after all these years.  But they'll stop for a local TV show that gets not even close to what we get in listenership  or viewership, whatever you want to say. 
[00:44:00]  Ship.  Ship.  Just ship.  Radio is shit in the entertainment business.  Always has been and always will be.  Oh, yeah.  And I tried.  I told these guys.  I gave them some consulting.  Sirius XM should just drop the radio thing.  Just drop it.  It says satellite radio.  Don't say radio.  Just say satellite.  Satellite sounds cool still.  Radio does not sound cool ever.  Yeah.  Never really did.  Radio.  Why would you do that?  Radio.  You're just lumping yourself into all the other.  It's all the crap. 
[00:44:30]  All the crap.  All the radio crap.  That is radio.  But why listen to such fucking geniuses like us?  All right.  Whatever.  That's fine.  No bitching, right?  Yeah.  What are you going to tell?  Oh, and also Weird Al is back in the news after 20 years.  What?  Weird Al?  Weird Al.  He's funny, that guy.  Boy, is he that?  Oh, that Weird Al Yankovic.  Crazy song.  Oh, yeah.  There was some controversy yesterday with Weird Al.  I bet there was. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, boy.  That guy's funny.  Wait till you hear.  Lady Gaga was pissed, or was she pissed?  Lady Gaga.  Oh, no.  Yeah, Weird Al had to do a Lady Gaga parody.  I hope everything's okay.  Weird Al sucks.  No, he's funny, but does the funny parodies?  Oh, it's hysterical.  Did he do a Lady Gaga parody?  I bet it's good.  You want me to tell you the name?  Eat it.  Wait, let me think.  Eat it.  All right.  What song was it?  All right.  This is what we can do.  Lady Gaga's song is called Born This Way.  We all know that, right?  Yeah. 
[00:45:30]  And Lady Gaga says she didn't rip off Madonna, by the way.  I was reading that in the shitter.  Oh, really?  She says that the beat is very similar, but it's the disco beat that's been around for  50 years.  Well, whatever.  It sounds just like it.  And I forgot her quote, but she basically told the reporter to go fuck himself or herself.  Oh, I know what he did.  All right.  So, Weird Al, how did he twist Born This Way?  He sang Born This Way, but he just had like a giant hermaphrodite penis vagina on the 
[00:46:00]  screen.  Yeah, that would be good.  Just like Lady Gaga.  And the song was called Come This Way.  Born This Way.  It's got to be some...  I know what it is.  It was Torn This Way, and there's a photo of Weird Al Yankovic's asshole with a cock next  to it.  Stinks.  And I'll tell you this much.  Torn This Way with a big log of shit with corn in it.  Where his dick is corn on the helmet. 
[00:46:30]  I'll give you this much.  He only changed one word.  Um...  There's your hint today.  Oh, I know.  Oh, uh...  Porn This Way.  How about this?  Born This May.  About the girl I'm seeing.  Oh, jeez.  Uncle Paul.  She's a child.  Well, we'll give the answer next.  Oh, I'd like to...  We're rolling Sam walking down the hall, so we're going to do the whole Sam on the red  carpet at the...  What?  Can I say who it is?  No, please don't.  Please don't. 
[00:47:00]  We need these people to hang around a little bit.  Hangar!  Hangar!  E-Rock, you got something over there?  Oh.  Nothing, right?  Of course not.  I'll play this then.  Again.  My dick, my dick, my tiny little dick.  It...  I never got in late, cause my tiny little dick.  You...  If you show your tip, my tiny little dick goes up and...  And there was one time that Eric made me come up watching gay porn. 
[00:47:30]  My dick, my dick, my tiny little dick.  The Virus.  Sirius XM.  This is the Obedien 3 Show.  Hey, quickly.  Is there anything worse than peeing on someone else's loogie?  Ew.  Yeah.  That just happened in the bathroom.  Ugh.  Ugh.  I'm peeing, and I look down, and someone's...  They had a fucking loogie up into the urinal, and now I'm peeing on his loogie. 
[00:48:00]  That's disgusting.  There is something worse, Jimmy?  Yes.  Yeah?  If you're yawning, and somebody pisses another person's loogie into your mouth.  Ah.  That could be a little worse.  All right.  There's your answer.  Third-party tinkle loogie.  Just a quick little thing.  We work with animals, though, man.  Yeah.  That bathroom, it's unbelievable.  You would think the bathroom would be at Port Authority or something.  I went in there earlier to do a little clipping of my fingernails, and I go into, you know, 
[00:48:30]  one of the toilet stalls, and there's just piss and toilet paper and fucking...  It's like, what animal doesn't just fucking flush?  I don't...  Just flush the fucking toilet, you pig.  I don't understand it.  I know there's a lot of angry people that work here now.  There's a lot of anger in the hallways, but they're taking it out in the stalls.  In the bathroom with shit and piss and whatever else.  Because they can't yell at the gang down the hall like we can.  I think we're one of maybe two shows that could just beat the shit out of management around here. 
[00:49:00]  The rest of them have to take it, I guess.  Yeah, yeah.  Because I don't give a fuck.  That must be it.  Some of these people need their jobs.  I don't need this.  So I guess they go in the urinals and just fucking take it out.  And they just start pissing and shitting and not flushing the toilet.  Oh, it gets to a point where things are smeared on the back wall.  Why not...  Just take your foot and fucking hit the goddamn flusher and get rid of your fucking waist,  you slobs. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, I don't know.  This is full of fucking slobs.  Anthony wants to go in and clip his fingernails.  I have a...  I'm a fancy man.  What happened to you?  I finally got my luggage back and my nail clipper was in there and I was like a homeless  person walking around with fucking disgusting nails.  So you had your mom's luggage?  I had one of their bags, yeah.  Did you go through it to see what she's up to?  No.  Frotchless panties and sex toys.  Oh, please.  A special belt. 
[00:50:00]  For Sal.  Yeah, strap on.  Rude!  Stop it!  Rude!  No, it hurts!  It hurts, Jesus.  He's basically your father, you sick fuck.  I didn't go through any of that, no.  No.  It was one bag and...  Were you worried they were going to go through your bag?  There was nothing in there.  Nah.  Nothing.  Just a shitload of clothes and, you know, the bathroom toiletries. 
[00:50:30]  Sure.  Had to go and buy more of them earlier in the week, you know, after we got back.  Because, eh, American Airlines, you know, what are they going to do?  What are they going to do?  Just sat there going, nah, we'll get it to you eventually.  Fuckers.  Wrong case of hooray for me, the hell with you.  Exactly.  Where did Sam go?  I don't know.  I thought he was coming in.  Sam!  Hopefully the emergency room.  You guys did the red...  That's a fucking bleeding wrist.  You guys go to the red carpet thing last night.  We don't want to give away what it was for.  Oh, look at this. 
[00:51:00]  Here comes a prime time, as they say.  Sam Roberts.  It's a new name.  And Sam got the greatest one-question interview ever.  A little bit he does, I guess.  Do you do that?  I do it.  For who?  You.  For us?  Yes.  When is that played?  On the show.  This show?  Yes.  Not your show that you hijacked from us?  There's no hijacking.  You hijacked the 10 o'clock hour from us.  I would love to play that.  I asked for it, and you said, yeah, we're not doing anything.  I thought you'd play a few O&A clips. 
[00:51:30]  It's now the Sam Roberts show.  No, I play...  Starring Roland and Troy, of all people.  I'm definitely playing less and less clips, but...  He just hijacked the hour.  Are we allowed to see the movies?  He really did.  Yeah, I think the pass that we get, you're allowed...  But you can't bring a guest.  That's fine.  All right.  Well...  So give us the feel of the red carpet, first of all.  Oh, my God.  You went back to Tribeca.  First of all, it's Hollywood Sam Roberts today, because that's what I was there for.  The Hollywood Reporter.  Well, the name changes. 
[00:52:00]  You are just a wrestler hack.  You really are.  It's not even good wrestling names.  No, you're just like, I'm no Hollywood Sam Ruff, really.  We gave up on the red carpet, I'll tell you, 10 years ago.  Why?  We were motivated to maybe go to some of these things and get some interviews we couldn't  get on the regular radio show.  Just not going out of the park.  They treat you like...  Because you're in radio.  I'll say it again.  They treat you like such shit that we're like, we don't need this.  Well, that's not...  I mean, we were in between New York, New York, and City Buzz. 
[00:52:30]  What is New York, New York, and City Buzz?  It's an NYU channel.  A what?  An NYU channel.  An NYU channel.  Yeah, you won't get there.  And what's City Buzz?  Public Access?  No, no, no.  It's not that good.  It's online.  City Buzz, everybody.  We got City Buzz coming up.  You were in between...  You could also get it in Hotels and JetBlue.  So you were in between a college TV station and an internet TV show. 
[00:53:00]  And the other one, Muni didn't show up.  Yeah, the internet, the website that was positioned next to us, which is a movie website, didn't  bother showing up, so we had a little more room.  People just don't give respect.  No, and nobody stops for radio.  That's the thing about...  And where were the heavy hitters?  And I put that in quotes, because I don't think they're...  Well, all the way on the other end of the carpet was your MSNBC.  As a matter of fact, MSNBC was next to us, and after the first interview, which was Bloomberg 
[00:53:30]  walking right by us, as if we didn't exist, MSNBC picked up their camera equipment and  their microphone, and they just walked to the other end of the carpet and positioned  themselves.  Couldn't you do that?  No, I mean, they would have been like, who the fuck are you?  Oh, my God.  But there's one person I got every freaking interview.  But do we have SiriusXM mic flags?  Well, no, we needed, like, one news network had four multi-rachel kids with oversized T-shirts  with microphones.  The Kids News Network gets all the guests, because they put two kids out on the red carpet, 
[00:54:00]  and so every celebrity stops for the little kids.  But, yeah, I mean, we had SiriusXM thing, and it said right in front SiriusXM, but...  How about next time you do the interviews from your knees, so you look like a little kid?  How to have that look.  Put little shoes on my knees.  Little tater.  Little tater tot that you are.  I mean, Annabella hooked it up nice for us, but then, once you get there, we're up to  where Tribeca puts us.  Yeah, I'm not blaming anyone from here.  It's just, this place gets no respect. 
[00:54:30]  Right.  I mean, it's the same for all radio.  That's what I'm saying.  That's why I can't rid of the radio.  Satellite entertainment.  SiriusXM is just satellite.  Yes.  That's it.  That's what I need.  Satellite.  Because Q104 was positioned next to us, but they didn't bother showing up.  They were like, fuck that.  Because they know that they're not going to be treated right.  But what ends up happening is, like, Roland and me, we were just, I love that Roland goes,  so it's not just me by myself, but we just get bored.  And so that we just start talking to whoever they offer us.  Because, I mean, I didn't know who a lot of the people were that they were offering us. 
[00:55:00]  Did you get the paper with all the list of people on it?  Yeah, but most of those people didn't.  Got the paper, got the paper.  Either didn't walk the red carpet or didn't stop.  Like Martin Scorsese and Steve Martin and Anne Hathaway.  Marty Scorsese?  They were there, but they didn't walk on the red carpet.  Why didn't they?  No, Steve Martin's not walking on this red carpet.  Did you see Martin?  Did I see?  No.  Scorsese.  No.  Now, why wouldn't they walk on that red carpet?  They didn't want to talk to people.  It's Tribeca.  It's not like a perimeter.  They don't need them.  Scorsese doesn't need to talk to people at Tribeca.  I don't understand.  Bon Jovi was there.  He didn't walk on any red carpet. 
[00:55:30]  But the other tea station, they got nobodies or somebody.  I just, they're flashing.  Where's your list?  While they're talking.  I'll get it.  Well, here, but you guys got to talk to John Tish.  Well, like I said, like, they start offering us, they start offering, not Tish.  I said Tish.  I know.  It's not a typo.  I purposely made sure I didn't say Tish.  They start offering us people that I don't know who they are, but we're bored.  I just want to talk to someone.  So I talked to John Tish.  All right.  Let's find out who John Tish is.  As Sam and Roland did the red carpet at the Tribeca Film Festival last night. 
[00:56:00]  We're here on the red carpet with John Tish.  John, what brings you to Tribeca tonight?  Big supporter of the Tribeca Film Festival.  Big supporter of New York City.  And here we are a decade later with an event that really helped us get through a very difficult, dark period in our history.  Where might some of the people at home know you best from?  Well, I was head of tourism in New York City for a couple...  Did you notice, by the way, that that's the question?  Where might some of the people at home know you best from?  Instead of saying, who are you? 
[00:56:30]  Who are you?  Who on earth are you?  That is brilliant.  Thank you, Sam.  My God, Hollywood Sam Roberts.  I didn't know who he was.  That was brilliant.  You talked to the head of New York City Tourism.  Because the PR lady...  He doesn't even have that gig anymore.  The Sam, that's racist.  The PR lady who was...  Sam, that's racist.  Oh, God.  She was actually really nice.  What about the N guy?  Well, come on.  How about the J broad?  The public relations woman who was positioned next to us was really trying for us.  Except she also didn't know who he was.  So she was like, I think he owns a chain of hotels, but don't quote me on that because 
[00:57:00]  I may be completely wrong.  Oh, well, you just quoted her.  No, I don't quote it to him.  She said don't quote me.  She said don't quote me.  We are co-owners of the New York Football Giants and won a Super Bowl a couple years ago.  Congratulations, by the way.  Thank you.  Three years later.  And...  Well, what about Tribeca?  Tribeca, I want to hear fucking phony assholes laugh at that joke.  I got to make him feel warm.  Got to make him feel comfortable.  You're making us nauseous.  Can we hear the Sam's titter?  Super Bowl a couple years ago.  Congratulations, by the way. 
[00:57:30]  Thank you.  Three years later.  And...  Well, what about Tribeca excites you the most?  Tribeca is now a place where people come to see great films.  They know that the program will be full of unique, independent films that really demonstrate  the strength of the industry, not only here in New York, but in the United States.  And before you go, this is Roland.  He works for us.  He wanted to ask a question.  Hey, Roland.  How are you?  What kind of car do you drive?  Yeah, no business. 
[00:58:00]  Roland.  He said you want to...  Thank you so much.  Okay.  Wait, what did he say?  He said none of your business.  He was annoyed.  He got pissed off.  Why?  Asshole.  I don't know.  Why the head of tourism...  Ex-head of tourism.  ...not want to answer your car?  Why was he mad?  I don't know.  Well, Roland was funny because he panicked for a second because he didn't...  I didn't know I was going to ask him.  And so...  But then when Roland said, what kind of car do you drive?  He was all pissed off.  And he goes, none of your business.  Started walking.  None of your business.  I guess so.  Oh, sweet.  Plus, in the interview, I was snapping my camera, so it looks like a lot of flashes 
[00:58:30]  when we're around.  Roland is also very obnoxious.  In case you didn't know.  And so what he was doing to the two people who were filming things next to us was, as  they were doing interviews, he was just taking pictures of nothing, so there were flashes  in their videos.  And the thugs were blinking.  He just kept snapping.  He gets away with it.  I love it.  And then he goes, I don't have to get away with this shit.  He just mumbles, and they go, oh, okay, he must have something wrong with him. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah, he must have had a head injury somewhere.  Exactly.  Growing up in the Addams Family house, really fucking...  Sam talks to Hugo.  Yeah, you didn't finish his title.  The strongest man in the world.  What?  Holy shit.  Yeah, I mean, look.  Is he the one we had on?  No.  I thought he was the strongest man in the world.  No, Hugo is.  I thought Derek Poundstone was.  What is he doing on the red carpet?  What's the hurricane stadium?  I don't know.  Mayor Bloomberg walked by us, and there were no people coming to us, so they were like, 
[00:59:30]  do you want to talk to Hugo, the strongest man in the world?  And I go, yeah, who else am I going to do?  What am I going to sit there?  What a collection of shit.  What about the Hannibal guy?  This is why we gave up on this.  Yeah.  You get nothing done.  Well, what happened was they were like, do you want to talk to Hannibal the Great?  And we were like, what?  And they were like, he's an old singer.  And we were like, no.  And then after that, we realized that's the caliber we're going to get.  We're going to have to say yes to everything.  It finally got to you that, like, oh, I see. 
[01:00:00]  It's not time to be picky.  That's who we're going to get in.  We're going to get in.  So instead, I went with Hugo, the strongest man in the world.  We're here with Hugo, the strongest man in the world.  Hugo, how did you get that title?  By campaigning all over the world.  So I've done it for about 12 years.  Right.  Oh, he talks like that.  Yeah.  Why does every strong guy talk like that?  I've done it for 12 years.  Why is he there?  He was so strong.  Did he look strong? 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, he was strong.  But what does he have to do with, like, Tribeca?  I think he's got some dopey documentary.  Everybody's got a documentary in Tribeca now.  You didn't ask him?  Why the fuck are you here?  No, I didn't get around to it.  I was talking about him being strong.  In my younger years.  And actually, there were a series of contests all over the world.  And whoever gained the most show and had on the most point was declared world champion.  You look at a guy like me, you can see what my build is.  How long do you think it would take me to compete on the level that you're at in terms of being a strong man? 
[01:01:00]  Actually, that's nothing to do with size.  It's mostly about strength.  So, I mean, somebody could be smaller and still being strong.  And to be honest with you, the strength goes with the heart and the head.  So, if you believe in yourself, everybody's got the talent to become the strongest and they can get.  What a lesson learned.  I believe that I am a strong person, deceivingly so.  And I could probably rank about six or seven.  Yeah, probably six or seven among those behind the rope. 
[01:01:30]  Do you get annoyed when you come to events like this and people ask you to display your strength and you're just trying to be a professional person?  Well, it's part of the game, I guess.  So, you get used to it.  How easy do you think it would be to lift the girl from City Buzz?  And that's not a challenge.  I have a question for his beautiful wife.  What's it like being married to the strongest man in the world?  Can you pause that?  Oh, my God.  It was okay until our honeymoon when I realized he drank a lot and would punch me in the breasts. 
[01:02:00]  It's the only way he can achieve orgasm is if he punches me in the breasts and then hurls me up at the ceiling fan as semen is coming out.  So, it's very difficult.  He's broken six ribs and I have a spinal injury and we've been married for exactly one month.  So, that would have been an answer.  Yes.  The strongest man in the world.  Well, I must say you really have to be strong because he can't leave the grocery. 
[01:02:30]  I have to do it myself.  Oh, God.  You don't let the finger around the house, huh?  Actually, I eat too much.  Well, the thing is, oh, my God.  This is nonsense.  It's the strongest guy in the world.  Can I say something for the audience?  And his wife.  Yeah.  And his wife.  This stinks.  Yes.  This is what we get.  Tribeca, you think you're getting all kinds of celebrities.  Yeah, man.  I see the commercials. 
[01:03:00]  Hugo.  Looks like a big deal.  What about De Niro?  It means triangle below Cornell.  De Niro didn't walk the red carpet.  Was he there?  I would assume so, but I wouldn't know.  It was too heavy.  Well, the thing is, it's your job to lift things.  So when you come home, the last thing you want to do.  You don't want to lift.  Exactly.  When you go home, you want to rest.  You leave the lift thing for somebody else.  Thank you so much.  He's thinking, this is gold.  Yeah, he's thinking, oh, finally.  He walked away from you guys, right? 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  With his wife.  And went like, oh, we killed that one.  We nailed that one so good.  Well, the world's strongest man doesn't usually get to flex his funny muscle that way.  The way he did, you know, for us.  I like to think that he's an old school guy, though.  He's like a woman has her fucking duty.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what this guy does.  She does the housework.  I may bring home money.  All right.  Well, and now it starts getting good because he circled this track.  Oh.  What is it? 
[01:04:00]  Sam and Roland.  Should I just read it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Try to call over the Olsen twins.  Oh, yeah.  Big stars.  Big stars.  And this show is.  Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen.  This show has such a rich history with the Olsen twins.  Yes.  That I figured this is going to be a great get.  Yeah, yeah.  But they were walking kind of fast.  Really?  They're kind of puny.  How fast could they walk?  They're pretty fast walkers.  Yeah.  Maybe they jog.  Let's see.  So why don't they just go in the side door?  Oh, and they actually were getting booed by the photographers because they weren't stopping 
[01:04:30]  for pictures.  Oh.  So we just heard from the other end of the carpet go boo.  And Roland, in all his wisdom, said, is Bruce here?  Because he thought they were saying Bruce.  They're not booing.  They're yelling Bruce.  All right.  Here we go.  Olsen twins.  Mary Kate.  Just one.  Not both.  Or neither.  City Buzz, did they stop for you?  They looked awful.  They are creepier in person. 
[01:05:00]  Wow.  Oh, City Buzz.  Oh, throwing a little fucking trash at them.  They looked like shit in person.  They're all skinny and stuff.  Everybody, though, that was on our right, that the Olsen twins were also walking by, when  I was yelling out, Olsen twins, come here, come here, like everybody that was next to  us was like, what the fuck is his problem?  Like, what is he doing?  That's what you do, right?  I'm like, I'm trying to get an interview here.  I'm trying to get the scoop.  That's what you do on the red carpet.  Of course.  That should be your name on the red carpet.  Scoop. 
[01:05:30]  Scoop.  Yeah.  Scoop Roberts.  Fucking asshole.  This interview should be picked up with and put in a plastic bag.  Yeah.  Poop.  Poop Roberts.  I think I lost it.  Sam talks to actor Scott Glenn.  He doesn't know who he is.  I didn't know who Scott Glenn was.  Who is he?  Scott Glenn.  I don't know.  I thought it was astronaut.  Yeah.  Rolling Glenn.  They go, Scott Glenn's coming by.  He's an actor.  And Rolling goes, is he astronaut? 
[01:06:00]  Although I believe Scott Glenn played an astronaut in The Right Stuff.  Yeah, she corrected me that way.  Yes, yes.  See if you can figure out where in the interview I'm trying to figure out who he is.  Who he is?  Yeah.  On the red carpet with Scott Glenn.  Scott, you have one of those faces that people look at and say, I know him from somewhere.  He's been in a thousand movies.  Oh, shit.  What's it like to be somebody who's so Google-able?  I don't know.  I mean, is it flattering?  I have no idea. 
[01:06:30]  You know, sure it is.  It's flattering because what I do is public.  I mean, it's public art or public communication.  The reason the question makes me stammer for a second is I'm not sure I understand or anyone  really understands what fame or notoriety or any of that means now that electronic media  can reach so many people so quickly.  But regardless of what it means, it's got to be nice that you're on this side of the 
[01:07:00]  rope and I'm on the other.  Well, we really appreciate your time and I hope you have a good time tonight and for the rest  of the festival, of course.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Oh, that guy.  He was also in Silence of the Lambs.  Oh, now I know who he is.  I should have talked to him about that.  He played the FBI guy that sent Agent Starling.  Oh, he was the Jack.  He played Jack.  Now I know his face.  Yeah, I was unfamiliar at the time.  That's the guy.  He's actually been in some pretty good fucking movies.  Like I said, he's... 
[01:07:30]  That was actually...  I think that was a pretty good get.  He's Google-able.  If you knew who it was.  He talked about electronics and stuff.  I don't know what he was talking about.  I wasn't...  See, but that would have been like, oh, that's a celebrity.  Did you Google these guys?  You got a service in that section of the...  Plus, this is...  I mean, snap to it.  You know, you want this guy?  Yeah, we'll take him.  Let's go.  You got to go right away.  By the way, I'm going Sunday to Ozzy's 6 o'clock premiere.  No, you're not.  I am.  Oh.  And...  I bet Hugo will be there. 
[01:08:00]  The world's strongest man.  Who's going to be there for us, though?  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to see the film and...  But Sam, you can't go because it's fucking Easter?  I'm celebrating Easter Sunday with my family.  What are you doing?  You're a fucking grown-up.  What is there to do on Easter?  Oh, my God.  People have to celebrate Easter.  No, they don't.  No, they don't.  Are you getting little bunny eggs?  What are you doing on Easter?  You're looking for eggs?  It's a major holiday.  It is a pretty big holiday.  It's one of the big four, I think.  I got Jess's parents, my parents.  Exactly.  Say goodbye.  I'm going to fucking see the Ozzy documentary. 
[01:08:30]  We'll be some celebrities.  It's a good man, but people do celebrate Easter.  Fuck them!  They're going to be like,  Sam, you're not obsessed with Ozzy.  No, but I have a job to do,  and it's a celebrity event,  and I don't care about fucking...  You're not obsessed with bunnies and eggs, are you?  Bunnies and eggs.  It's not religious.  But you get together with the family.  He sees his family all the time.  His mother does his laundry.  How much family do you need to see?  But the problem is,  it's like a family holiday.  You have no choice.  Thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter.  Yeah, celebrate Christmas.  What's the fourth one?  That's it, right?  Exactly.  Those three are the big ones. 
[01:09:00]  Thanksgiving.  Halloween.  And Easter.  Halloween, it could go either way.  First July.  Fourth July.  There's a million holidays.  Easter is one of those fucking...  It's a biggie.  Yeah, it's a family one you gotta deal with.  Who am I going to go with?  Someone from here has got to go with me.  I need someone on the fucking red carpet.  Well, we got...  Pacino's going to be there.  What?  Pacino.  He's just saying that.  Roland also is selling me on this press conference going,  we'll probably get one-on-ones with Steve Martin,  Anne Hathaway, some of those...  No.  Of course not.  But we have a Tribeca pass that we can give 
[01:09:30]  to another staff member temporarily.  All right, we'll figure it out.  Listen, let's get through this crap here.  Sam and Roland get Dennis Leary to come over to them.  Dennis Leary.  So finally.  He wasn't going to come over.  He was walking right by us,  and we had to yell,  I think actually I left down the track  with me and Roland discussing whether or not  we were going to get him.  Okay.  Hey, get it.  Get it.  Opie and Anthony.  Well, if he starts walking,  we've got to interrupt.  I know.  VR lady's doing what she's doing.  We've got a team of 1,000 here,  but it may not be enough.  Let's see if we can clinch this, Roland. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  I think we will.  You're feeling optimistic?  Yeah.  The guy.  He's a millionaire.  The guy should just, like,  shut up.  What's he got to say?  I know.  He's like,  I have a blue vest on.  Dennis.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  We're just here covering for Opie and Anthony.  What's bringing you to...  Why aren't they here?  They wake up early.  I don't care.  It's a huge event.  Tell John, man.  That's right in their alley.  Rock and roll.  New York City.  This is supposed to be their thing.  I'm very disappointed.  You think it's unforgivable?  Extremely disappointed.  That Opie and Anthony wouldn't come to an event like that? 
[01:10:30]  Tim Norton, I can understand.  He likes to sleep late.  Plus all the transvestites keep him up late.  I'm going to come up, I guess,  when Rescue Me comes back.  Come up tomorrow.  We're always there.  I can't.  Tomorrow I'm on the jury for the short films.  Maybe after the festival, then.  No.  No.  No.  Spider-Man.  I don't have any time with you.  That's funny.  You've got a lot going on.  Good to see you, buddy.  Thanks, guys.  Yeah, he's doing Spider-Man.  He'll come up when the festival's over,  and he'll look to me like,  no, I'll come up when Rescue Me time.  The movie Spider-Man. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  Not the Broadway show.  Oh, yeah.  I imagine.  We wouldn't like to see him there.  Might get injured.  This is terrific.  We've got two clips to go.  Sam talks to Paul Dano.  Yeah, Paul Dano is famous.  He was in There Will Be Blood.  He was the kid.  Give the fuck up.  That was a huge movie.  Yeah, big deal.  So what?  Daniel Day-Lewis caressed his face for six hours?  The son.  The son in There Will Be Blood.  Not the little kid.  The kid kid that Daniel Day-Lewis had a war with. 
[01:11:30]  I have no idea.  Oh, yeah, he was good.  And who's Zoe Kazan?  Zoe Kazan.  Zoe?  That's his girlfriend.  And she was also in Revolutionary Road  and that Alec Baldwin, Meryl Streep movie,  whatever it was called.  I saw that depressing movie, Revolutionary Road.  Stunk.  Which one was she?  Stunk.  I don't remember who she was in that movie.  I didn't remember.  Why did Revolutionary...  Stunk.  Why, Jimmy?  Why?  A, DiCaprio was miscast completely.  Kate, whatever her name is, was decent.  Kate Winslet.  Beckinsale.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Kate Beckinsale.  I got it wrong.  Kate Winslet was good. 
[01:12:00]  And DiCaprio looks like a big, huge Hollywood movie star.  You put him in this depressing movie,  you're supposed to believe in his character.  It's impossible.  It was terribly, terribly acted.  It looked like a play that they tried to fill.  They were doing theater acting and theater dialogue.  It stunk.  Yeah, I hated it.  She was serviceable.  He was horrendous and miscast.  Wow.  Stunk.  That's him.  That was Dano.  I just saw.  I just looked up.  Oh, good.  There's Dr. Octopus.  The red carpet. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah, amazing.  Oh, well.  This interview, I didn't know what to do with these two, so I just started acting like I  was their friend and I was happy to see them together.  That's fair enough.  Let's see.  I don't know what to do.  All right.  Let's see how it went.  We're here with Zoe and Paul at the Tribeca Film Festival.  First of all, Paul Dano, you were in There Will Be Blood.  You played one of the creepiest young people to have ever been in a movie.  How does it feel to have that legacy?  Wow, I like that.  I'll take it.  Sounds good.  That's it.  It's just me.  Yeah. 
[01:13:00]  Walking?  Did you know when you were making it that it would be as good as it was?  I think it's one of the better scripts that I've ever read.  Yeah, it's the latest one always is the best one.  I was a Thomas Anderson fan before having worked with him and with Daniel Day-Lewis,  so I was probably so effing excited.  Fucking actors are boring.  They are.  That's true.  They are.  Yes.  I love them and I love getting my picture taken with them, but they're fucking boring. 
[01:13:30]  This is why you don't stay for a conversation after the picture.  They're fucking horrible.  Is there any reason to play the rest of this clip?  Let's be honest with each other.  Yes.  There is?  It's Paul Dano.  You've got to get him on the radio.  You've got to have A-listers.  Be there.  Thinking about the outcome wasn't even within my realm yet.  Uh-huh.  Now, it seems like you guys might be dating, I'm assuming.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is it difficult dating within the industry, as they say?  I don't think it has been. 
[01:14:00]  No.  It has been.  No.  We're not very, like, industry, industry people.  No.  Like, we live in Brooklyn and, like, most of our friends aren't in the business and, like,  And, like, wow.  It's so normal.  So you were in Revolutionary Road, is that right?  So, that was, a lot of people said that was a very sort of a downer movie.  I loved it.  Are you guys dark people?  Because There Will Be Blood and Revolutionary Road are very dark movies.  Ooh, spooky.  I'm, like, such a Pollyanna. 
[01:14:30]  Like, the sky is falling and it looks beautiful.  And Paul is, like, a little bit more of a pessimist.  But we, I think we balance each other out nicely.  Fuck up.  This is beautiful.  I love what I'm seeing.  Congratulations, you two.  Go on.  Go on.  Oh, boy.  They looked at me like, what the fuck is he doing when I started doing that?  Because I acted like I was an uncle.  Yeah, yeah.  You kind of acted a little strange there.  Yeah, they were like, what is he doing?  I am, honestly, I'm looking at a picture.  I don't remember her in Revolutionary Road. 
[01:15:00]  Actually, I don't either.  But she was in it.  I'm depressed.  I'm really sad right now.  She's got a big nose.  What about?  This whole fucking thing is basically depressed.  What happened?  I'm just sick of it.  Because they wouldn't let us talk to any interesting people?  Like Hollywood and the Tribeca and the arts.  I know you woke up depressed because I read your Twitter.  Yeah, man.  Why are you depressed today?  I'll tell you what.  I didn't wake up depressed.  I woke up.  I had, like, a daydream when I woke up.  Like, I was just a good day.  Like, you're half asleep fantasy that I was driving to work and I had been shot in the 
[01:15:30]  back of the head and went into a coma for 30 years.  Holy shit.  And I woke up and all my friends were dancing.  That was what I was thinking of when I first got up this morning.  What the fuck?  I don't know why.  I just thought of it.  That is odd.  That's because of those fucking websites you go to, man.  I'm telling you.  But this is just depressing.  It's, they're all, I'm more disgusted with myself for caring about them because they're  all fucking bores.  And I'm, I mean, you know, they seem like a nice enough guy, but I'm, I'm annoyed almost 
[01:16:00]  at my own obsession with them when I realize how little conversationally they contribute.  I'm mad at myself.  There's nothing going on there.  And people like Zoe Kazan, they have way more heat than us.  Oh, yeah.  And they're fucking zeros.  That was another one.  We really are zeros.  They just showed Rainn Wilson on the news.  Yeah.  Roland was hilarious because he was like, we'll get Rainn Wilson.  I know his publicist.  And so, uh, Rainn Wilson is walking by with his, from the office.  He stinks.  Oh, which one is he? 
[01:16:30]  He's the famous one.  He's not Steve Carell.  He's the, he's the, uh, the crazy one.  He's the second banana.  Yeah, Dwight.  Dwight.  Oh, Rainn Wilson.  Yeah, I do know that.  And he's walking by and, uh, Roland calls out the publicist's name and she looks at him.  But then we noticed that Rainn Wilson is walking quickly going, la, la, la, la, la, la.  And then the publicist had to look at Roland as if she hadn't seen him at all and just keep  walking.  Why?  He wasn't doing it.  He wasn't going to stop.  Why can't he stop for two seconds and be bored?  Why would he?  He's the quirky guy in the suit and sneakers. 
[01:17:00]  When a guy like that was coming up in the business, he would have stopped for a fuck at  everyone.  And that's what drives me nuts.  Yeah.  They change their entire personalities after they make it.  We see it all the time on this show.  We've talked about it.  Yeah.  They got shit going on now.  That guy would have done every interview a few years ago.  Yup.  I just saw Scorsese.  He must have done the red.  They had two red carpets, one for photographers and one for people doing interviews.  And this just depresses Jimmy.  So Scorsese just did the photographers.  Okay.  You should bring cameras then.  Scorsese is Scorsese.  Oh. 
[01:17:30]  Scorsese is iconic.  Is it?  Yeah, man.  Scorsese.  I can never be mad.  If he was here to talk to everybody but me and then he fucking spit on me, I still  couldn't badmouth.  Is it that bothersome to talk to people when you're famous?  Yeah.  Like the Olsen twins, they walked the red carpet to walk by everybody.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They barely did any interviews.  Sneak in the back then, bitches.  Yeah.  And then just go in the back if you're there to see something.  I mean, even Fox just aired footage of the Olsen twins walking by.  So they didn't get an interview with them either. 
[01:18:00]  So what the fuck were they doing?  You know what?  They arrived, the publicists probably just put them on in a lie and they walked by.  Whatever.  Do you think this Tribeca thing is it's a too cool, they're trying to make it too cool  to be one of those red carpet events?  I don't know.  They had a giant red carpet set up for this thing.  Of course they did.  And of course, every person who's running Tribeca, who's associated with Tribeca, they were  all doing interviews.  We couldn't stop getting requests.  He's on the board from Tribeca.  The nobodies.  But they weren't actors. 
[01:18:30]  Nobodies.  Where's De Niro?  De Niro was not walking, doing interviews.  Very busy.  Yeah, I mean, what's that?  Jane was there, Rosenthal, his partner?  His business partner.  His business partner.  That's who you want.  No, no, no.  Why not?  If you talk to her, you know what?  You might get him.  All right, listen.  We talked to her.  I've talked to her twice now.  I've done two interviews with her.  Okay.  All right, listen.  Great.  I've gotten the scoop.  We made you sit through all that to get to this point here.  The greatest one-question interview ever from Sam Roberts.  I feel this is the best ever. 
[01:19:00]  We sat there.  We probably should have started and ended with this clip.  Without a doubt.  Listen, I had to sit there until...  So make the listeners sit there?  Exactly.  I was there until nighttime.  I missed sleep for this.  Everybody is now on the ride with me.  So everyone should suffer, because they are out there.  They're not suffering.  They're suffering.  They're like, oh, Sam, he certainly made lemonade out of lemons.  You're going to check in at 2 p.m. and then it starts until like 7.  You made shit out of lemons.  You had lemons and you made lemonade shit.  You guys had to check in at 2 p.m. and wait around for five hours? 
[01:19:30]  Of course they did.  Of course they did.  Assholes.  Wait, if I want to go down there, you think I'm checking in at 2 o'clock?  That's not happening.  Sunday check-in's at 1 p.m.  No.  All right, listen.  You have to put on bunny ears.  Here's Sam Roberts.  And there's a good story behind this after we play this clip.  The greatest one-question interview ever.  I got her done.  10 seconds.  Okay.  Primetime Sam Roberts here with Sir Elton John.  Sir Elton, how are you with electronics?  With electronics? 
[01:20:00]  Yes.  Hopeless.  Thank you so much for your time.  Thank you.  Fantastic!  Wow.  See?  You talked Elton John.  There you go.  Sir Elton John.  Usually I wait until those one questions go through the production process, but this one  I wanted to share the next day because Elton John, he was leaving.  He wasn't going to do interviews except he was doing a dummy interview with the person next  to me.  And so I went to his publicist and I was like, look, we just want to grab him for  10 seconds and then you can be on your way.  It's just literally one question. 
[01:20:30]  She goes, okay, kind of exasperated.  Why would she be exasperated?  She had to get him to go.  It's a promotion for his movie because that's why you were down there.  Yeah, it was from his documentary.  Why would they ever be exasperated?  I know.  And Cameron Crowe directed the documentary.  He didn't walk the red carpet either.  But why be exasperated?  I don't know.  Just do a little bit of time with everybody.  Why can't you just be nice and go, well, he just doesn't have time.  He wants to get inside.  I'm sorry.  Why would you actually be like, okay, if you have to.  And so she's like, these guys hung around for seven hours to talk to Elton John for 10 
[01:21:00]  seconds.  And she's exasperated.  We should call you stuttering Sam where somebody walks by and you yell out a question of a  celebrity, but it's not mean.  It's just nice.  Yes, it's nice.  So I asked him that question and she was literally pulling him through people's interviews.  Like some of the interviews he was doing on camera, he wasn't even finished with his  sentence and she'd pull his arm and bring him to the next person.  And she's pulling him away.  So he did.  He said, I asked him the electronics question and she goes, all right, come on.  And she had this face like, I can't believe you just fucking wasted my 10 seconds with 
[01:21:30]  that asinine question.  10 seconds.  And everybody who was after us was like, you got to be fucking kidding me.  Because they all thought they were going to get out.  This kid just asked him about electronics and now he's leaving.  Cause she just, they just all saw her pull him away and leave the red carpet after that  dumb question.  You cock blocked them all.  And I said, listen, I'm here for the scoop.  Nobody knew.  And everybody next to me was like, why don't you ask him what he thinks of the movie? 
[01:22:00]  Fuck that.  And I go, he's going to think it's good.  It's his movie.  Yeah.  And I go, did you know?  Oh, it's fantastic.  It's wonderful.  It was a lot of fun.  Everybody worked so hard on it.  Yes.  You know, I believe it's some of my best work that we've, we've arrived.  Did anybody on that red carpet know how Elton John was with electronics?  How about the brown carpet on his head?  Okay.  Should I ask him about that?  You really should. 
[01:22:30]  We're trying to keep him polite.  That's good.  Carpet on his head.  I also, by the way.  Who was he being interviewed by next to you?  New York, New York, whatever.  New York, New York gets an interview.  They are a hot chick, though, interviewing.  Yeah, they had a good looking.  So did you.  He doesn't like hot chicks, asshole.  Exactly.  He would rather have a twink like Sam Roberts.  You know what?  Make your mic look like a cockhead.  He probably would have talked to you for 45 minutes.  Oh, hell yeah.  City Buzz was all pissed, though.  They didn't get any Elton John interview. 
[01:23:00]  Neither did you.  Yeah, I did.  I got the electronics thing.  God, shit.  I'm going with you guys next time.  I want to check this bullshit out.  It's been many years.  You're not going to like it.  I'm going to go, though.  Literally, you're going to have to stand there for two hours and interview no one.  It's fine.  That's the way red carpets go.  Sunday with Jimmy.  Yeah, why don't you go down with Jim?  I'm doing Easter.  I will get that.  I might be able to get good ones on Sunday.  You will.  I mean.  I don't know if I'm going to do interviews on Sunday or just go to the event, but we  need somebody down here.  Yeah, we'll figure it out behind the scenes.  By the way, I have something to give away. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  You want to do it now?  We can do it.  You said today I have two pairs.  I would do it now for the people that just suffered and sat through this.  There is no suffering.  Not one person suffered.  I mean, it's the real listeners are listening right now, and they deserve a prize from little  Jimmy Norton.  That's what I say.  They got the prize.  This Sunday at 6 p.m.  This is Michael from Sharon's office actually emailed me.  Two pairs of tickets.  To paradise.  Nice.  You want to do one now and one later?  Yes.  So right now, one pair of tickets to the Aussie premiere this Sunday in Tribeca, 6 p.m. 
[01:24:00]  The movie's called God Bless Aussie.  God Bless Aussie Osborne.  And it was done by his son, right?  His son produced it.  Jack produced it.  We have Jack in on Monday.  And it's supposed to be a great documentary about Aussie.  So if you're in New York and you're a hardcore Aussie fan, it is fucking Easter, so you have  to be able to get away.  Okay?  So if you call up now, E-Rock will take your information.  And I give away both pairs now.  Just two pairs.  Yeah, just give it a little.  And give me the information so I can give it to her office.  Mad man.  Wow, they were listening to this, Sam.  Boom.  Phones are lit.  And they're all like, yeah.  So just give them two random callers there, E-Rock, to make it official. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, but just try to get the New Yorkers so we know they're going to be here.  Make sure they can go and they're not wasting our time.  On Easter!  I will also tell you, in the coming weeks, this is something I got on the red carpet  that I'm going to put through production before it's heard, of course.  One question, I also got Lauren Hutton.  Lauren Hutton, the apt-toothed model?  I don't know who she is.  How old is she?  They said she was famous.  She's an older woman.  She's pretty old.  I used to fuck you.  She's hot.  Oh, yeah.  See, guys?  You got something to look forward to?  Does she still look hot?  No, no. 
[01:25:00]  No.  Although, she's got the gap in between.  She was in American Gigolo with Richard Gere.  Roland told me he'd still fuck her.  She was one?  And she was in there?  And she was the female vampire in that, uh...  What was that movie, that comedy?  Anybody?  She was a female vampire.  Oh, wow.  It was a piece of shit.  Uh, Terms of Endearment?  Exactly.  Oh, God.  She was giving her all in the eyes.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  She's not...  She's still hot, right?  Yeah.  I bet you she's 60-something.  She's still breathing.  What the hell?  Did you see Dame Helen Mirren? 
[01:25:30]  Dame.  I tweeted a couple weeks ago the picture in front of a mirror.  Uh-uh.  Oh, wow.  And a lot of people said they absolutely would go there.  I'll find the picture for you guys after the break.  I believe so, yeah.  How do I find this fucking thing?  I, uh...  I got a great...  Someone, uh, tweet that to me so I can show the guys.  I got a great picture with her.  Helen Mirren.  With Helen Mirren?  Yes, I did.  She was fucking...  The picture is her in front of a mirror, and her big bosoms are almost exposed. 
[01:26:00]  She's just holding them in place.  And a lot of people said they would go there.  No.  Wait till you see the picture before you...  No, I don't have it.  I do not have to see a picture.  It doesn't always have to be young.  I know.  It doesn't always have to be young.  No, it kind of does.  I agree.  It kind of does, as opposed to old...  I was thinking about these moral questions and stuff, and age and things like that. 
[01:26:30]  And not crazy shit, you know.  But, like, anybody, unless you have an old woman fetish, that would rather have an older woman, and I don't mean a woman in her 40s or something like that.  I'm talking about women that are in their late 50s, early 60s, and beyond, would rather have that than a supple 18 or 19-year-old.  It's crazy.  There's something wrong with them, psychologically. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah, yes.  There's a mental problem there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, Once Bitten was the movie.  Thank you.  See, everybody's talking about Lauren Hutton now.  Thanks to the...  Once Bitten.  You don't remember Once Bitten?  I remember Once Bitten, Dwight Shy, with a huge fire.  Oh, well, yeah.  Dead people in Rhode Island.  How do you spell mirroring?  Can someone look right?  Oh, here we go.  Thank you.  I think Zeket gets the credit today.  Z-E-C-K-E-T on Twitter.  This picture got a lot of people on my fucking Twitter feed really worked up. 
[01:27:30]  Let me see.  I'm telling you, man.  It's not bad.  Oh, crap.  She's in her 60s.  No shit.  Jimmy, be honest.  Nice tits.  No, no, no.  You can't...  Be honest.  That's actually not...  I'm not into older women, but that's a sexy photo.  And she was so sexy in Caligula that Helen Mirren, I'd probably fuck, to be honest with you.  God.  Just for the story, right?  She's kind of sexy.  I've always...  For older women, I'm not into that shit.  I don't know why I ain't buying that.  I'm going to retweet this picture, OP Radio on Twitter. 
[01:28:00]  Thank you, Zeket, for helping me out today.  I also got a red carpet interview that I didn't give you with Bob Balaban, but it hit the cutting room floor.  Bob Balaban?  What happened?  What is that?  He was on Seinfeld.  How did you miss that?  He's the guy...  No, I got the interview, but I didn't...  Which one is he in?  I decided not to share it.  He's in fucking...  He was in Close Encounters.  He stunk.  He was in Close Encounters of Third Kind.  What did he play?  He didn't make up.  He played the mashed potatoes.  He might as well have. 
[01:28:30]  Apparently, I ended up on the cutting room floor.  And he was on Seinfeld.  Yeah.  He wasn't very funny on the red carpet, though.  He was on all those fucking movies that Christopher Guest makes.  I know.  I like him in the movies, but stick to the movies.  Waiting for Guffman.  That was better than the...  That was worse.  Best in show.  That was the worst in the stuff you ended up handing in?  First of all, the stuff I ended up handing in was good.  And evidence of that...  If the crickets would stop.  Evidence of that...  He works his balls off. 
[01:29:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  This is what he gets from us.  Sign in, Opie.  Two o'clock.  Yeah.  I don't need...  Interviews.  Shugga-ducky.  Quack-quack.  Right.  Shugga-ducky.  Quack-quack.  Hamburg.  I don't need that.  Why don't we have Hamburg on my machine for the third day in a row?  That's an angle problem.  Oh, shit.  Eric, why?  He's lazy.  Because he hears the word and just has to get some.  He gets all hungry and forgets what he's doing.  Eric, Opie has asked for three days.  Why is it not in the...  He asked for...  He mentioned it yesterday.  That was the first time I heard it.  Why didn't you do it?  Oh, it's the first you heard. 
[01:29:30]  Not the day.  Not the day we did it.  He went home early yesterday.  And Opie was like, oh, I would like that on my machine.  He's tired.  I don't know.  I mean, Roland and me were here very late.  What time did he go home?  I mean, he was out of here by what?  I was out by like 12.  Yeah, I mean, noon.  Why?  Oh, not midnight.  No, no, no.  Noon, yeah.  And I mean, he didn't get here until 6.  That's a short day.  How come he was here for such a short amount of time?  He thought he was done.  Had he done all his work?  I mean, for what it is.  Hey, I just want to appreciate...  I just want to say I appreciate riding up in the elevator with Eric. 
[01:30:00]  Was it fun?  It's a much slower ride, I'm sure.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Because he's fat.  You and Eric riding up in the elevator together?  Yes, yes.  We had two guys at the same time this morning.  Aren't we supposed to be prepping the show for you?  Well, I guess so, but it was okay.  It was nice.  Let's not get into specifics.  We had a little conversation.  You know, I bop on in about a quarter to two.  Because you walk by our office and we've been sitting there for a while.  Oh, I see.  Like, every morning when I walk by, you guys are in there working very diligently on the computers. 
[01:30:30]  You're gathering up material.  And, yeah.  Eric was, you know, joined me and Kenny on a little elevator ride.  It was nice.  At least you start your day nice.  Yeah, yeah.  It was cool.  And, by the way, as I said, all the approval I need for my interviews was a text I just got from Dr. Steve that said,  Genius.  So play all the crickets you want.  I got Dr. Steve.  Wow.  I didn't mean literally.  Dr. Steve.  Roman and me put in a lot of extra hours. 
[01:31:00]  Especially, I mean, if we were on E-Rock's schedule, so many extra hours.  Look at E-Rock's.  E-Rock's not happy when you're teasing.  I know.  I'm just trying to just poke fun.  E-Rock comment.  Yeah, I know.  Please.  He's shaking his head.  No, he's tired of that bullshit.  Anything.  Ha, ha, ha.  He's tired of that bullshit.  Yeah, he's sick of this shit.  Right at his barn.  Can we take a break now, please?  We could, I gather.  We got the Weird Al thing.  It's only going to get better from here, folks.  My interviews are better than Weird Al songs.  I want to hear the Weird Al. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah, I get back.  We got the Hollywood scoop for the people.  Now we can get back to the comedy.  Oh, yeah.  That was, this is informative.  This is trying to give Hollywood news to people from the source.  You're panicking.  I'm not panicked.  You're panicking.  You've never, I've never panicked.  Let's just sit there.  I don't panic.  Let's sit there.  I don't like dead air.  You don't have to sit.  Well, you provide.  Let's keep the energy up, guys.  Weird Al coming up next.  Oh, I like that out.  I don't.  This is the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:32:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Uh, yeah, frigging, uh, one of those reporters, uh, that died in, in Libya.  Yeah.  It was like the director of, uh, Restripo, which was a really good documentary.  You saw that one? 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  Really good documentary on, uh, the war.  And, um, man.  Yeah, a guy got killed over there.  Covering, uh, Libya, I guess, for a vanity fair or something.  He's from Brooklyn, right?  Pretty bad.  What?  From Brooklyn, I think.  Yeah, yeah, kind of a local guy, yeah.  Did a good movie?  It was up for an Academy Award, right?  Yeah, it was a good movie.  Good documentary.  What happened to him over there?  Bomb?  I haven't heard.  They don't know yet, officially?  I haven't heard, yeah. 
[01:33:00]  Why would you do that if you had a hit movie?  It's just like one of those things, I don't know, these people go over there and do those  things.  You watch some of the old school reporters, too, you know?  You know, Walter Cronkite and those guys, they were over there in Vietnam, and shit's  just blowing up right next to them.  Does it become a drug for some of those guys?  Yeah, it probably does.  It probably does.  Like, especially this guy doing a documentary like that on, uh, on, uh, a firebase.  Um, probably, you know, so I think some people kind of get not addicted to it, but kind 
[01:33:30]  of into it.  And maybe don't think about the dangers of it.  They're just kind of there and, uh, caught up in the moment.  And this guy then decided, hey, I'll go over into Libya.  And whoopsie.  Dead.  Him and another guy.  And Qaddafi.  Hondros.  And Qaddafi just hanging in there.  Yeah, yeah.  That's because, uh, it's the half-hearted effort of the United Nations.  Obama.  Worst president ever.  The U.N. is the worst. 
[01:34:00]  Worst president ever.  I don't even fault Obama.  It's the U.N.  Yeah.  It's either, this is why we shouldn't have gotten involved.  Right.  You either carpet bomb the country and kill him or mind our fucking business.  Stop morally policing the whole world politely.  It's embarrassing.  That's what they said.  It's like, no, we're not going to kill him.  Well, well, if you're not going to kill him, then he's going to stay in power.  What are you doing then?  Oh, we're going to offer air support to protect what they called, um, you know, civilians.  They don't want, they don't want innocent people getting killed.  But the people they were trying to protect were the armed, what amounts to insurgents 
[01:34:30]  to Qaddafi.  It was an insurgency, a revolution.  So are they on their side offering the military that's trying to overthrow the government military  help?  Or are they not by not killing Qaddafi?  What the fuck?  Like it was half-assed.  Well, why are the people, and again, to play house liberal here, but why are the people  who are, uh, are fighting us in Iraq, uh, insurgents because we hated Saddam, but yet 
[01:35:00]  the ones who are, are fighting in, uh, Libya are freedom fighters.  I don't get it and fuck it because we still hate Qaddafi.  So, you know, I guess they were fighting against Qaddafi and they were fighting for Saddam.  So that's the difference.  Terrorists, freedom fighter, insurgent.  And it could all be intermixed, uh, according to your, you know, who you are, where you  are, what country you are.  So I, I just think they really half-assed this one.  Of course they did.  They went in under this guise of helping, uh, keep a slaughter from happening. 
[01:35:30]  And meanwhile, what is it doing?  Exactly.  It's not stopping any war.  It's prolonging anything.  If you ask me, if Qaddafi could have crushed this uprising, uh, then so be it.  He crushes it and then he's back in power and no more people are getting wiped out.  But now you're just prolonging the fucking thing and, and he's bombing them.  You're bombing the, uh, Qaddafi side and more people are getting killed.  And if that was your, your point was to keep people from getting killed, I don't think 
[01:36:00]  it's working out too well.  It's just, we should either be the, if you're going to show balls, right.  Then fucking show.  We have been, the Americans, I hate to tell the world, have looked like fucking absolute  pussies since Vietnam.  And it's not because our military isn't tough or great.  It's because the people running things are too afraid of perception.  They're too afraid of looking bad or of, or of killing innocent people.  And meanwhile, our own soldiers get killed because we're not allowed to just fucking 
[01:36:30]  bomb people into the stone agent and win in a, you know how world war two was won by  bombing everybody until they said, we can't take this anymore.  Please stop bombing us.  I haven't slept in years.  That's exactly how war ends though.  Now we got this weird fucking idea.  And I don't know when it happened.  That war can be fought nicely.  In the sixties, it happened with Vietnam because there was too much political pressure at home. 
[01:37:00]  So when people started using, losing political positions or when that became threatened, then  fuck the soldiers.  They don't care if the soldiers are dying or being killed.  So what's more important is public opinion at home.  They started seeing what the horrors were of war and saying, oh, wow, we do that.  Oh, we can't do that.  We have to, oh, Jimmy's looking big.  He's looking badass.  He's flexing.  I'm listening, buddy.  Fuck off.  Flex too, motherfucker.  God damn, you got a good body.  I got to have the biggest arms in this place though. 
[01:37:30]  What's that?  Mine are bigger than yours.  I don't know about that.  Flex before I lose mine.  But we can't see because he has a fucking pajama top on.  I'm fucking like, I got guns.  You do have really guns, but you have skinny arms.  You have fucking like the machinist arms.  Like it just shows every sinewy yoga body.  And it's got a lot of guns.  I have to fuck you with a carrot.  Hey, back to the guy that died in Libya.  Yeah.  Yeah, because this guy has more info. 
[01:38:00]  Chris on Long Island.  What's up, Chris?  Yeah.  My understanding this morning was that he was a photographer, not a reporter.  And one of his last tweets, like yesterday or the day before, was about the insurgents  or the rebel fighters or whatever were attacking, and there was no NATO support for them.  Yeah.  And then the next day he gets blown up by a mortar fire.  Yeah.  So he tweeted that there was no support for him, huh?  Well, you know why?  It's an old story.  Who cares? 
[01:38:30]  You know, they went in there, guns a-blazin' at first, the U.S., England, the United Nations,  France.  And then after a while it just became like, meh, whatever.  A couple of French planes will fly over every so often.  Fuck it.  Well, again, we don't pay much attention to it because all of a sudden we're talking about  budgets and Medicare and everything else while we have people dying across the world.  Yeah, and Obama's got to go around and raise money for his campaign, so he's officially 
[01:39:00]  on the campaign trail.  So, you know, what effort could he really give to three wars that are going on?  You can't blame him for having to do that, Anthony.  That's just the system.  Oh, bullshit.  How about you got the job?  How about instead of trying to fucking keep the job two years out or whatever the fuck  it is, you do the job when you have the fucking job?  I'm sick of presidents, and I'm talking Republicans to...  Hey, hey, hey, look, I'm talking Republicans too, okay? 
[01:39:30]  I'm not just talking Obama.  I'm talking every fucking president.  Why the fuck, a year, two years out, are they stopping their job to try to keep their  fucking job again?  Do it till the end, and then run, you cocksucker.  You're sitting there at fundraisers.  Change the campaign finance laws, and you'll take care of that right away.  That's bullshit.  But you know what?  The problem with the finance laws is that all these radio stations and TV stations won't 
[01:40:00]  get money from political advertisement, so that will never fucking change, because  once again, corporate America, man, has got to put a ball.  Yeah, man.  Yeah, I hear you.  Hey, Jimmy!  I'm right here, my friend.  Jimmy!  Yes, sir.  I knew it, and I fell for it anyway.  You're needy today, Jimmy.  I kind of knew it.  I knew that was happening.  No, I knew it, but then we went Jimmy again.  He had so much gusto, if I could...  It's because you woke up sad today.  I'm just fucking...  I'm just depressed at my own perception and my own fucking... 
[01:40:30]  I'm not feeling sorry for myself.  I'm more annoyed at myself, but I just fucking daydreamed that I had been shot in the head  and everybody 30 years...  And I literally went through people like, okay, everybody in Black Sabbath is dead.  Like, I was a 72-year-old man.  That's what you were concerned about.  And the nurse was telling me.  My girlfriend, oh, well, here's what happened to her.  She got married and she had a son and she died of breast cancer.  Wow.  You're like Sigourney Weaver in Aliens. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, Anthony was dead.  Ope was alive in his 80s and his kid was 30 and fucking...  Jesus.  Is that about right?  No, but yeah, 30.  That might be about right.  30 years, sure.  Who else I went through?  I literally was just zoning out.  Like, Ali was dead.  Everybody in Kiss is dead.  Wow.  I gave a couple of people that were still alive.  My nephew was 46.  I went through this at fucking 4.53 in the morning.  I woke up just like half asleep. 
[01:41:30]  And you were freaking out?  Horribly depressed thinking I missed it all.  You know why?  I'll tell you why.  Because I was talking about Artie Lang last night.  Where's he been?  I don't know.  I feel sad for Artie because I feel like he's been out of commission for like a year.  And I hope...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't know if he's depressed or not.  But he popped up a couple times.  He did.  And then he disappeared again.  But because I thought of him because I slept the day away yesterday.  I took a nap at 1.30.  Woke up at 8.30 p.m.  You wasted your life right there.  But I mean, like I went to do a spot and then I went to another thing. 
[01:42:00]  And I was home by 12.  But I felt like I blew the whole day.  And then I started thinking about Artie.  I'm like, God damn.  He's like for the last year.  Or a year.  Almost two years.  Or a year and a half.  Whatever it is.  He probably is feeling like, fuck.  I've lost his time.  Yeah.  And then it fucking segued into that thinking.  I guess in the morning for me.  Like, what if I wasted 30 years?  And it's like, I just want to go grab the guy and fucking pick him up.  What are you doing, dude?  Come on.  It's fine.  All right.  You fucked up for a year.  Whatever.  You got a great book out of it, I'm sure.  Now fucking come on.  Get back to work.  Well, it takes longer than that. 
[01:42:30]  Some people, five years go by.  And ten years.  And you realize, oh, fuck.  What was I doing?  A year and a half or two years is acceptable.  Because literally in that time, whatever depression you went through, you can really come up with a...  Especially a guy like that who people are interested in.  You can come out with a fucking good book.  So in hindsight, it will not have been a waste.  But you don't want to go any longer than that.  Or you're making something.  Like you're learning something.  Yeah.  Or you're just bettering yourself somehow.  Yeah, whatever.  It is kind of odd. 
[01:43:00]  But it was 30 years in the future?  30 years.  Because I've thought of that a lot.  Like what if I went into a coma for a year or six months?  Was this shithole still here?  No.  I actually thought through Sirius, too.  It was like they had folded ten years after you got shot.  They lasted ten more years.  But then the technology's changed.  And Sirius has been gone for 20 years.  Did you have a headache?  I did.  From the bullet in your head?  No.  Well, what happened was, and I fantasize this, too, is because technologies are going so quickly, 
[01:43:30]  the stem cells help my brain regenerate.  Oh.  You got a movie, sir.  This was a half.  You got to write all this down.  And there was also...  Crazy.  Who else did I think of?  I thought of a few people that had died 10, 15 years ago.  Comedians.  Kevin Hart was still alive in his 60s, and he came in as a little older man.  I was like, I'm so happy you look old.  Oh, please.  Keith Robinson was dead.  Because he died in his late 60s because he started drinking late, and it's just his heart  gave out.  What about now? 
[01:44:00]  Colin was fucking...  I didn't know if Colin was alive or dead.  Oh, he was alive.  He should be dead.  But, you know, right now, he was in his 80s and just miserable.  Yeah, well...  You know, and I'm in my 80s.  And were you old?  Did you look in the mirror?  I was 72.  Yeah.  Sure.  You saw yourself as old?  Yeah, but I remember I thought when I went to the bathroom, they had taken mirrors out  because they didn't want me to be shocked and see how old I was.  And they wouldn't let my nephew come because he's in his 40s.  So they just talked to me slowly, and I looked down, and I noticed my hands were old man hands. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  Holy shit, what a great movie.  And you were all freaked out?  Yeah.  I actually want to write a movie called The Man Who Was in a Coma for 30 Years and Had  a Lot of Realizations.  I don't think...  It's going to be very wordy on the poster, Jimmy.  Do you think so?  A little bit.  A little bit.  And it's just...  The poster is just a hand with liver spots on it, and, like, I'm going to draw lines in  over the guy's shoulders so you can see that he's shrugging.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did this bring tears this morning? 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  I was crying when I was at the sink.  Oh, Jimmy.  But I don't know why.  I wasn't...  It was just because I think my...  I slept so much yesterday that I was at the sink washing my hands just crying.  But I think it was more just overtiredness.  You feel like you're wasting your life, Jimmy?  No, I don't.  I'm doing what I love.  I love my job.  I love doing stand-ups.  So what is this based on, then?  Just that wasted day and just thinking of things that I should be doing or whatever.  But, no, I don't feel like I'm wasting my life.  I feel like I'm doing exactly... 
[01:45:30]  I'm blessed.  I'm fucking sober.  I should have been dead when I was 25 if life was fair.  Let's say hi to Josh in Philly.  What's up, Opie?  I think your Flyers lost last night.  They did.  They did, but the Rangers...  Wow, finally somebody that actually...  I know.  I try every day, Anthony.  ...from a city that likes the ESPN.  I try.  The big game last night was the Capitals and the Rangers.  That's a hockey game.  But Sabres beat the Flyers one-zip.  That series tied at two.  You guys might be in a little trouble.  Yeah, maybe, but we got the Phillies, though. 
[01:46:00]  I'm in for the Phillies.  You had a robot throw out the first pitch yesterday?  Fuck that.  That was bullshit.  I know.  We saw the video.  It's horrendous.  At least the robot got booed, though.  Well, it's Philly, of course.  Of course it did.  I'm surprised they didn't throw things at it.  They even boo things that have no clue it's being booed at.  Yeah, it's a robot.  You dummies.  Fucking insane, though.  Throwing cheese steaks at it.  Yeah, dummy.  I mean, Gano.  The battery's just bouncing off the dumb robot head.  Robot's like, thanks, it's batteries. 
[01:46:30]  I eat these.  Yeah, right.  It's great.  That's why you have a little small talk.  It leads somewhere every time.  What do you got, Josh?  About two years ago, I had this thought in my head.  I'm 28, and I figured, I'm going to die.  Do you guys ever worry about how you're going to die, when you're going to die?  Does it bother you?  I came to a realization very recently, it doesn't bother me anymore, because I finally realized  that everyone dies, so how bad could it be? 
[01:47:00]  Everyone doesn't.  But think about it.  You know what I mean?  No one escapes that.  So how bad could it be if it happens to everybody?  Horrendous.  You just want to hope it's quick enough where you don't get to really know what's going  on until it's done with.  Yeah, but then when it's done, you didn't even know.  Then you didn't know, so it doesn't matter.  That you were ever alive.  Yeah, yeah.  But you don't want that bullshit.  You don't want to be the cut-in-half guy in the street reaching out for people.  As Woody Allen said, I don't mind dying, I just don't want to be there when it happens. 
[01:47:30]  That would happen to you as a member.  That was Groucho.  Oh, that was Groucho.  I don't want to belong to any club that would happen to you as a member.  No, but Woody Allen does that line in fucking Help Me Out.  I don't know what Help Me Out is.  In the movie Help Me Out.  Take the money and run, I think.  Oh, does he?  He absolutely did that line.  Was it an homage?  Or was it Annie Hall?  I don't know.  I'm sure it was.  Where's the Woody fans out there?  That's actually a Groucho line. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, Groucho.  I don't want to belong to any club that would have me as a member.  I always thought that was Woody because I heard it in a Woody Allen movie.  I am positive.  I will bet anyone right now.  Let's go.  And there was some...  He wrote a letter to someone about...  It was an exclusive club that didn't allow Jews, but he wanted his daughter to get her  something, so he wrote a letter to him.  He goes, she couldn't go in the pool or something because she was a Jew, and he goes,  well, she's only half-Jewish.  Can she go in up to her knees?  That was very funny.  Groucho's letters.  It's a very famous...  Looks like Annie Hall. 
[01:48:30]  Annie Hall.  Okay.  I had no...  Yeah.  I always thought that was a Woody...  It is a Groucho line, but apparently it was a Woody Allen movie.  No, I believe Jimmy, but I always thought until this very moment it was a Woody Allen movie.  And it's such a famous Groucho line.  I'm sure it was as an homage.  See, I don't know much Groucho shit.  I don't know Groucho.  He was the fucking...  Take it, Wade.  Fastest gun in the West.  Yeah.  Because he had to be clean and improv.  Groucho was the fucking idol of all the comedians that we look up to.  They all idolized Groucho.  Oh, Groucho.  Yeah.  Woody, all those guys worshiped Groucho.  Did he do shit humor?  He would've. 
[01:49:00]  I guarantee you he would've.  I bet he did a lot of scat humor in the bedroom while he was banging some fucking girl that  looked like Miss Crabtree.  Dude, no, he liked Young Pussy.  Yeah.  You put fucking...  You put on those old, like, you bet your life or whatever clips of Groucho.  Just to hear him talk and when you see the way his mind is working and he's fucking firing,  you're like, God damn, he was a funny dude.  Yeah.  1955, you couldn't curse.  You couldn't insinuate sex.  You couldn't...  No.  You know, for me, clit hugger is always a word to go to.  I don't know what it means, but clit hugger gets a laugh every time. 
[01:49:30]  You imagine those private shows because no one was able to record anything back then,  the dirty shit these guys were doing when they weren't on TV or on the radio, whatever.  And I saw Groucho sitting in a wheelchair with a blanket covering his legs, shaking.  Great.  Just shaking like, because he's so old.  How old?  Oh, well, he's pretty old.  That was pretty good.  Hunched over.  I just like how he walked, kind of hunched over with the cigar. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah, that's how Groucho looked when I saw him.  Oh, boy.  Do we have any clips of Groucho, like a 30-second or one-minute clip of him talking?  He was just a funny guy.  Yes, we know Larry King's doing stand-up, and we might as well...  Is he doing stand-up?  We might as well break this news.  We will have Larry King live in studio.  Yes.  We should start promoting that.  Larry King will be on this show live.  And if we puss out, then I have no respect for this radio show.  I'll be gone, too.  The only question I really want to ask him is why he asked that rape victim about the groceries. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  Like, I really want to know.  And I'm not going to insult him by it, but I'm going to ask him, with the tragic story this woman was telling,  what would lead you to ask about the groceries?  And to get, you know, right from the horse's mouth there.  Yeah, we'll get that done.  Then we'll punch his liver spots and tell him to get the fuck out of here.  That's how we handle Larry King. 
[01:51:00]  Paul Hargis is a big Larry King fan.  Oh, is he?  Is he?  Yeah.  So if Paul Hargis is awake, he may...  Call in?  Yeah.  Now, that would be nice.  I'd like to hear that exchange.  Chip's a big Larry King fan, too.  Chip?  I don't know Chip, but I know Paul.  Could you give us a sample question from Paul Hargis?  Oh, I can't speak for him.  I don't know what he might ask.  I don't know.  Wow.  Well, you know the guy.  Yeah, but I don't know what he might ask.  How come you didn't interview more children? 
[01:51:30]  Always adults.  I used to use your show in my classroom about current events.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All the kids liked it.  Oh, they did?  Sure.  Sure.  Make their little bottom sweat.  Oh, God.  What a ghoul.  Jimmy, you want a name for your movie?  Yes.  I already have one, but...  Andy and...  What was your name again?  I bet you can't say it twice.  Hold on, Andy. 
[01:52:00]  One sec.  The man who falls asleep for 30 years and then wakes up and has a revelation.  It's close.  Realization.  Realization.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go to Andy and Cleveland.  No, it's revelation, but then realizations and parentheses.  That's too wordy.  That's even better.  Cleveland checking in.  What's up?  Sorry I can't talk sports with you guys.  Your fucking city sucks, but what do you got, Andy?  Yeah, well...  How about Chip Van Winkle? 
[01:52:30]  And I'll go now.  Yeah, why did you go Chip Van Winkle yourself?  Ah, you told him.  I know I did.  Oh, sorry.  And now you have an answer why LeBron left Cleveland.  Second guessing.  Are they still mad LeBron left, do you think?  Or are they over it?  I don't even know.  I know nothing about that sports.  I never think about that situation.  No.  Dumb sports.  No.  Fucking bunch of overpaid punks. 
[01:53:00]  Oh.  All right.  A little trivia for little Jimmy Norton.  I'll get it.  I'm the fucking...  Believe me.  In high school, I was voted Trivia King.  In my yearbook, it's a picture of me, and they drew a little crown on me.  Really?  As Trivia King.  And it says TK on it.  Trivia King.  That's right.  Yeah.  Kurt in Orlando.  Morning, boys.  With a K or a C, Kurt.  All right, Jimmy.  Let's see how well you know your...  I want to ask you about Shamu first. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, he's too busy killing trainers.  Where are you from?  Florida?  Orlando.  Orlando.  Okay.  All right, Jimmy.  Kenny, what was the phrase that actually got Groucho fired from his little game show?  I'm not even going to say it.  Let's see.  The phrase that got Groucho fired?  Yes, like instantly. 
[01:54:00]  I don't know if there's actually a phrase that got Groucho fired.  So that isn't...  Probably.  Could you be a little louder, Kenny?  Anyhow, there was a young lady out there.  Hold on a second.  Hold on.  What happened?  What happened?  Kenny's just such a brute.  He's unloading things from my thing.  Like, the mic is right here, and he's like this.  He's taking stuff out of a paper bag for Jimmy, and it's just making so much fucking noise. 
[01:54:30]  That's him being quiet.  Yeah.  That's the best thing you can do.  Oh, he's just stumbling.  He just doesn't know.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  What was the phrase?  I was trying to have a funny guess, but everyone probably would have gotten me fired eventually.  Go ahead.  And anyhow, he had the young lady on there, and she was really young and really attractive,  and says, you have ten kids, huh?  And she says, yes.  And he goes, well, you know, I love my cigar, but every once in a while I take it out.  You blew the fucking quote. 
[01:55:00]  Uh-huh.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  The quote is, and I don't know if this is right, was to...  Why would he say I love my cigar?  Yeah.  Apparently, it was to...  This is the story I heard, is that he was talking to a guy.  Right.  And the guy said, why do you have ten kids?  Well, I love children.  Well, I love my cigar, but I take it out once in a while.  Yeah.  That's the quote I heard.  I don't know if that's true or if it's an urban legend.  Maybe we can go to Snopes.  I heard it was in the butt.  He said, in the butt.  It was actually on the game show.  Oh, okay. 
[01:55:30]  Well, I...  Oh!  In that case...  Oh, man!  Oh, man!  Um...  Do you know what I almost just did and I didn't do it?  I was just...  I don't know why I had the other one.  I wanted to just frunk my crackers against the mic and say Crackernack.  I don't know why I wanted that.  Crackernack!  How would it have sounded if you did it?  It's Crackernack.  But honestly, it was such a childish fucking urge.  Crackernack! 
[01:56:00]  You're manic, man.  I love it.  I was crying this morning.  I certainly was.  Now you're a silly goose.  Yes.  I'm eating some turkey chili.  I love turkey chili.  Oh, that is good stuff.  I know.  You know what you need when you get turkey chili?  It should come with a turkey sweater.  Turkey sweater, boo.  Oh, turkey sweater.  Fuck, dude. 
[01:56:30]  God damn it.  All right.  Thank you, Kurt.  No problem.  You guys have a good amount of time.  Kurt Vonnegut!  You were terrific today.  Dude, though.  You take care now.  Call me when you have no class.  Jimmy's going to eat some turkey chili.  We're going to break.  And then when we get back, we're going to do Weird Al's Lady Gaga.  I want to hear this so bad, because Weird Al, through the years, hoping nothing but joy  has this man delivered to a world.  What were some of those songs that made you just happy?  Oh, Eat It, which was Beat It.  I lost on Jeopardy. 
[01:57:00]  That was terrific.  I'm fat.  Oh, my God.  Another one.  I'm on.  I'm on.  I'm on.  I'm on.  I'm on.  I'm on.  I'm on.  I'm on.  I'm on.  I'm on.  I'm on.  I'm on.  I'm on.  Crazy Brain, which is about Susan Smith.  Why?  On a topical hack.  The house next door to me was sold.  Oh, that was somebody else.  Wu-Tang.  Yeah.  By the way, Groucho never said that.  Yeah.  No?  I figured.  Really?  Urban legend.  It says here from a Reader's Digest interview, Groucho was interviewed about it by Roger Ebert. 
[01:57:30]  Wow.  And he says, I got $25 from Reader's Digest.  What the hell's that on your face?  Yeah.  Hey, I'd have that checked out.  Sorry, Dan.  That's okay.  You got paid for something you never said.  I get credit all the time for saying things I never said.  You know that line in You Bet Your Life where the guy says he had 17 kids and I say about  the cigar, blah, blah, blah.  I never said that.  Wow.  That's a quote from Groucho and Stuff.  Plus, I'm reading that You Bet Your Life was taped.  They would tape about an hour for every half hour of a show. 
[01:58:00]  So they could edit the fuck out of it if they wanted to.  They edited it.  And Jimmy just got turkey chili.  What's wrong with you?  Now turkey chili's all over Jimmy's crap.  What happened?  I licked my cracker and smelled it.  I don't know.  Jimmy does that all the time.  He takes his saltine cracker.  He licks it and then smells it.  Cocksucker.  And then I fucking dumped my turkey chili on it and it fucking made a break for it and  landed on my balls. 
[01:58:30]  Oh my fucking God.  I'm the turkey chili skillet and kid.  Holy shit.  What the fuck, Jimmy?  I'm having a meltdown.  But I'm not angry.  I'm in a good mood.  But I literally won't do it.  But I wanted to just take my turkey chili and splash it up towards the ceiling.  And let it just hit the ceiling.  But you know, a hot turkey chili, it would be all over my neck.  Yeah, it would be all over the place.  Why do you check your water bottles now that we're talking about stuff?  I don't want anybody drinking out of it.  Yeah, that makes sense.  Every day you check your water bottles.  I do.  You put a check mark.  That makes sense.  No one drinks out of it. 
[01:59:00]  There are bottles and if guests come in, you don't want them fucking...  What do you put on it?  I write in very small font.  This water bottle belongs to James Norton.  And I put my address.  I put it in very small font.  But I took classes in college.  I took four years of tiny fonting.  So I can literally write on a grain of rice my home address.  Wow.  I got to see that.  Sure.  Maybe I can write a joke and say it on the show.  Fucking asshole I am.  Are you feeling okay?  Yeah, but my leg is damp from turkey chili. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah, now he's at your old turkey chili cock.  Yeah, you got turkey chili leg.  That's right after turkey foot.  Oh, and you play turkey foot with the kids.  You hop that little foot in your mouth and you go...  You make turkey noises.  And the foot just smells like tobacco and bad breath.  Yeah.  And denture cream.  Yeah.  And they laugh and they kick...  Holy shit.  I can't fucking believe I got...  I can feel a damp... 
[02:00:00]  You know what?  You ever fucking...  Look at this fucking spot right in the front.  It's like when you piss and you fucking piss drip in your pants.  Yeah, you get a piss drip.  But it's chill.  You have turkey chili.  It looks like you shit the front of your pants.  Yeah, exactly.  It's fucking awful.  I feel like Sir Elton.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ah, fuck.  All right.  We're going to step aside so you can handle turkey chili.  How fattening is turkey chili?  It's like fucking 2,000 calories, right? 
[02:00:30]  Isn't it crazy?  It's not good.  As opposed to good?  I just have it as a little treat every so often.  Me too.  Oh, that Holly Bobo.  Yesterday and today.  God, that girl, that Holly Bobo girl.  Did they ever find her?  No.  She's so dead.  Yeah, she's dead.  I don't know about that.  I'm sorry to say it, but...  Nah, she's dead.  Oh, please.  She's too hot to not be dead.  Fucking creeps.  You don't do this with your crackers?  What the hell?  Jimmy puts the whole thing in his mouth.  I thought you just licked it.  Lick a cracker and smell it.  You'll understand it.  It's not... 
[02:01:00]  It doesn't smell like breath or anything like that.  Don't smell mine.  Can I describe what it looks like?  You put a dollar in a vending machine and the dollar comes popping back out.  That's exactly what he did.  That's how his...  He does...  He does that with crackers.  He popped it in his mouth and it just shot right back out at the front of his mouth there.  And then...  And then he smells it.  I like Jimmy's augmented turkey chili stance now that he's taken.  Yes.  The wide leg.  Turkey chili.  Very over the console.  His chin is like two and a half inches above the turkey chili.  Very safe now.  Your legs are spread. 
[02:01:30]  It's like when you're trying to drink out of the colored water fountain, but you don't  want any part of it to touch you.  Hold on a second.  There's an Amish man coming down.  Oh, it's sorry.  It's just fucking bladder in his black jacket and pants.  Amish man.  That creepy outfit.  He just walked by shaking his head like, I know.  Yeah, I know.  He's going to build a fucking barn door in front of fucking Shade. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, God.  Oh.  Cool.  I'm throwing up some gang signs.  Come on.  Come on.  Do it.  Do it with me.  West side.  West side.  Come on.  Pulling down some dead presidents, yo.  West side.  West side.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:02:30]  All the virus.  Serious XM.  Thanks for calling the Anthony Cumia suicide hotline.  Where the prominent radio host will listen to your cry for help.  And with his patented five-step solution.  He'll hold your hand through this troubling time.  Number one.  Get way too excited about the suicide note.  What does your note say?  I don't want pity.  What does your note say?  It says, hey, have a great run.  My time is now.  Have fun.  Number two. 
[02:03:00]  Insult the author after the note is read.  That's it?  That's it.  You need to punch that up a little.  You'll realize it's not about you.  It was never about you.  It was always about Anthony and how he was going to get his hands on your gun.  Number three.  Get too inquisitive about weapons.  What kind of weapon do you have there, Tom?  I have a choice.  A Walter PPK or a Beretta 9mm. 
[02:03:30]  Or an AR-15.  Number four.  After shots are fired, make sure to find out which gun it was.  Whoops.  Hello?  What was that?  The .380?  It was another 9mm.  And five.  Ask for the weapons.  Can I have your guns?  One will probably use it as an evidence, but I'll put the other one away.  And I'll will it to you, Anthony.  Fantastic.  So if you're thinking about taking that big plunge, why not wheel all your guns over  to Anthony from the Anthony Cumia Suicide Hotline? 
[02:04:00]  Oh, God.  That's morbid.  The virus.  Get in touch with the O.B. and Anthony Show.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  Send your feedback to feedback at O.B. and Anthony.  Dot com.  O.B. and Anthony.  Is Tom still alive?  I don't know.  I don't know.  We just play that production piece, and I'm wondering myself if he's still alive.  If he is, the whole thing's a farce.  Well, we had a great bit going, but in the end, the bit sucked because he never died. 
[02:04:30]  He never died.  The whole thing was him, you know, finally dropping dead or something.  He called us, said he had like a year to live or something like that, so he checked every  Friday.  Horrible disease.  Is Tom alive Friday, right?  Yeah.  And that was a production piece they made around the phone call where he actually discharged  a firearm in his house, live on our show, or his apartment or something.  He thought he was going to take his own life there, but he didn't do that either.  Fuck, man.  Not natural, not suicide.  Pits aren't supposed to go that long. 
[02:05:00]  No.  If we make a bit for you that says, is Tom alive Friday, you got to do the right thing.  Yeah.  And end the bit.  I don't know if he's alive or dead.  We'd have heard about it, though.  We'd have heard about it.  From who?  Yeah, one of the fans.  He kind of hooked up with some of the people at some of the road shows we did and shit  like that, so someone wouldn't know.  Maybe we'll have an answer tomorrow.  Maybe we'll start it up again tomorrow.  I mean, I'm sure maybe we could find, dig up his number from somewhere, but...  Yeah, let's get an update on Tom. 
[02:05:30]  As far as I can find...  Let's see if he's still alive.  As of January 26th, Tom was still alive.  Oh, okay.  Where's that from?  It's on some information site.  Oh, okay.  All right, can we get him on the phone tomorrow?  We'll go old school and see how...  If we can dig out his number, yeah.  And see how he's doing five years later after we started the bit.  Jesus.  Imagine if he dropped dead like...  We can redo Hopscotch Tuesday and fucking...  Oh, yes!  And Kiss and Midget Thursday and fucking bowling Sundays, segwaying into Mondays. 
[02:06:00]  It's about time you see it my way.  I hate that.  We're bringing it back.  I hate that fucking building so much.  That was an emasculating experience.  But that whole thing was a goof on the hell we were going through.  I know.  It was just...  It's a sign of the time where we were all miserable, and we were trying to make both  work.  And I was listening to you up in the car yesterday.  They have that grossest week on fucking the Stearns replaying, and I'm listening to something  they were doing about some guy that fucked a trach hole. 
[02:06:30]  And they said had a relationship with, but I'm like, that was 1999.  I'm like, you...  I couldn't believe.  Yeah.  Like, that era, I believe.  But it's like, good luck doing that shit in fucking 2007 or 8.  Oh, forget about it.  On satellite.  On regular, you couldn't do it.  I mean, here you could talk about it, but you couldn't talk about it on regular radio.  Oh, no!  It implies insertion!  Those fucking CBS lawyers should all be fucking...  And they continue to get something.  They continue to keep their jobs.  That's what's amazing.  I saw some numbers about what the head of the CBS radio division gets paid or whatever. 
[02:07:00]  What do you get paid?  It's some ridiculous figure.  Is it more than a million?  Yeah, it was some ridiculous figure.  For what?  And we were let go, and we were doing way better than the lawyers were.  That doesn't make sense.  Keeping them working, anyway.  All right, so Weird Al Yankovic was...  Weird Al!  He was a trending topic on Twitter yesterday, man.  There was a lot of shit going down with him and Lady Gaga, and it was just unbelievable.  An unbelievable day on Twitter.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  I guess he came out with a song based on Born This Way. 
[02:07:30]  What could it possibly be?  And then he said that he couldn't put it on his new album.  I guess there's going to be a whole album of this crap.  And then...  He puts out whole albums?  I think so.  And then Lady Gaga said, don't put that song on your album, I'll sue, or something like  that.  So that's...  Sue!  So I think he went on Twitter to bitch and complain about it, and then it turns out that  Lady Gaga didn't even know Weird Al Yankovic was alive, basically.  So who said...  So it was a huge misunderstanding.  And then it turns out that Lady Gaga will allow it to go on his album, and she likes the 
[02:08:00]  song that he came up with.  Oh, okay.  That was it in a nutshell.  It was an all-day thing yesterday on Twitter.  I must have missed that.  Well, yeah.  I wasn't really paying attention to that part of it.  A lot of attention on Weird Al yesterday.  Yeah.  Too busy fudging around.  Do you want to hear the song?  Sure I do.  It's called Perform This Way.  Ah.  Perform This Way.  Instead of Born This Way. 
[02:08:30]  Uh-huh.  I have not heard a lick of this yet.  How bad is it?  Danny, you heard it?  It's got to be embarrassing.  Well, I mean, if you're a Weird Al fan, I'm sure it's right up your alley.  Yeah.  I just haven't been a Weird Al fan since I was about eight or nine.  Yeah.  So, Eric, I don't know.  Did you hear this new one yet?  No, I haven't heard the new one yet.  Eric's a really big Weird Al fan.  I don't know if everybody knows that out there.  Are you?  Eric's a super big-time Weird Al fan.  Not super big.  I grew up listening to him.  Wait, you're a real fan of his?  I was, yeah.  Yes, you are. 
[02:09:00]  Shut the fuck up.  What are you, Eric?  You're a giant fan.  Answer the phones.  Oh.  Eric, why are you so...  Why are you...  Hold on.  There's a couple things going on.  I want to start with this one, and then we'll get into the Weird Al thing.  Why are you so upset today?  What got you?  Exactly.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Why?  No, why?  Nothing here got me.  No.  No, no.  There's something going on.  Yeah.  I was not having a good night and a good morning.  Why were you?  Why?  Because I got sick this morning, and I came in...  You puked?  Yeah.  From what?  From the food last night.  What did you have?  Everything. 
[02:09:30]  No, why did you puke?  We had three answers like that.  I went with a salad.  What did you go with?  Everything.  And I was trying to get to, why did you puke?  Weren't all of the mirrors removed from your home?  But I just couldn't get to.  Oh, no.  I don't like to use my food.  Food poisoning?  What did you have last night?  Yeah, because my chick's sick, too, from it.  Oh, wow.  What did you guys have?  Chinese food.  You ordered takeout?  Yeah, it's not like fast food Chinese.  It's from a really nice restaurant. 
[02:10:00]  What kind of chang sauce did you have?  The what?  What kind of chang sauce did you make?  Chang sauce.  I don't even know what that means.  What do you have?  What do you have?  I had General Tao's chicken.  It's the worst thing you could eat.  And it's not General Tao.  Yeah, I know.  Can you give me a...  Sao, soo.  Chao.  There's like nine pronunciations for it.  That is true.  Pronunciations, but there's one pronunciation for pronunciation.  That's why you're on the air and I'm not.  All right, so you had fucking...  Wait, I didn't even know the calories of that thing.  It's probably like 8,000. 
[02:10:30]  Weren't you supposed to be trying?  It's in like a demi-glaze.  Demi-glaze?  You don't even know it's chicken.  It's so deep-fried and crystallized.  I know.  It's just...  Believe me, it's delicious.  Oh, I love it.  But, yeah, sometimes...  And they use the fattiest part of the chicken because they know it's not about the chicken.  It's all camouflaged.  I love General Tao's chicken, though.  I'm telling you, it's great.  You put that in some motherfucking hot mushrooms?  I need to know.  Yeah.  I really need to know.  I'm going to go ahead and...  I'll just estimate off the top of my head 2,500, but I'll go and look it up.  Yeah, for peace.  So, it's pretty much your calories for the day. 
[02:11:00]  And what else did you have with that?  Because that's coming with rice.  It's a combination with rice and that stuff.  No, no.  It's restaurant style, so it's just the plate.  But also, you get egg roll, right?  The what?  What else did you get?  No.  I had a...  Montan soup?  No, the lo mein noodle soup.  Lo mein noodle soup.  Yeah.  And what did your girl have?  She had...  The salmon mousse?  No.  Good reference.  Ginger chicken with string beans.  Now, how is she sick and you're sick if you ate different stuff?  Yeah.  We both got it from the same place, so I don't know. 
[02:11:30]  I had a...  Did you share each other's food?  Like, try...  Hey, I'll try this.  I'll try that.  No, no, no.  Had it all?  Nope.  I'm sure she tried.  I don't like ginger stuff and she won't eat the crap that I eat, so...  Maybe she was just giving you a hint.  Oh.  She pukes and goes...  Were you shitting a lot?  No.  You didn't get the flu.  Wasn't shitting at all.  It was just throwing it right up.  No.  But once it all came up, I was fine.  It's just...  It was a bad night in the morning.  You were probably over eight.  I didn't finish the meal.  Oh.  But what'd you have before you got there?  Nothing.  It was delivered.  Oh.  What'd you have for lunch? 
[02:12:00]  It's a valid question.  Chicken salad.  Are you gonna try to eat healthy again?  Why don't you stop murdering chickens?  Try.  It's just like chicken holocaust.  How do you forward your fucking mail on an iPhone?  Cocksucker!  I'll show you.  I'll show you.  I can do it in one second.  Yeah.  Throw it in the garbage.  It's forwarded to the garbage.  This is...  I opened a mail from Gmail.  Oh, it's not fed to my phone.  Right.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  And you need to do it in... 
[02:12:30]  Oh.  Or check out the full version.  But as far as Eric's food goes, the best I could find here is that a serving of General  Tso's chicken, whatever that might mean, is 844 calories.  But who really just eats what a proper serving size is?  So you could probably just take that and double it.  I would double that easy.  Double it.  So you've got 1,700 calories.  And now...  Wow, look at the cholesterol for the percentage.  And if we're doubling all of this, you had more than 100% of your cholesterol.  More than...  You had almost 200% of your sodium. 
[02:13:00]  200% of your sodium.  Jesus.  Lots of protein, though.  Good for you.  That shit's gonna catch up to you.  Shit.  Hey, Iroch, the serious question.  Why were you a fan of Weird Al?  I mean, every once in a while you heard a song and you're like,  Eh, it's kind of clever, whatever.  But you wouldn't think twice about it.  That rhyme dopey.  That rhyme or whatever.  Thank you.  You're like Weird Al.  Would you go to a Weird Al concert if he performed?  I've gone to one, yes.  Wait, wait.  You actually went...  What do you get at a Weird Al concert?  Exactly.  Decide what you deserve, which is a kick in the stomach. 
[02:13:30]  Go ahead.  How was it?  There he goes, he does...  Breath's the same, but the voice is different.  He does...  My friend Dean would say that when you farted.  Sorry.  Go ahead, buddy.  I apologize.  So, yeah, what was that?  Walk us through a Weird Al concert.  Walk us through.  Does Weird Al have an open air for her?  Yeah, he does the David Copperfield thing,  where it's just a huge montage of, like, 
[02:14:00]  every talk show he's been on.  Montage!  Sorry.  Just keep interrupting.  I'm tired.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  It's okay.  So, what kind of montage of what?  Walk us through.  Just don't step on our feet.  Every talk show appearance he's been...  All right.  I'm teasing.  I'm teasing.  Go ahead.  I'm listening.  Okay, I was waiting.  Every talk show appearance he's been on, 
[02:14:30]  every interview he's done,  like, on Extra or the Entertainment Tonight,  those kind of things.  So, you're sitting there through, like, a...  Four-hour fucking...  Yeah, it's pretty long.  And then he does...  What you didn't see at the beginning  is in the middle for his little intermission.  You're watching more, like, clips of the movie  he put out and then other things.  UHF.  I liked that movie at the time.  UHF was great.  Put it on now.  I don't even want to.  I put it on a few weeks ago.  It's bad. 
[02:15:00]  Not good.  I don't remember it being Kramer from Seinfeld's in it.  What does he close with?  What's the opening song and the closing song?  It's usually whatever the big song is off his most recent album.  No, it's not anymore.  He's got to open and close with, like, the big hits from the 80s and early 90s.  Before he goes into intermission or whatever that break he does,  he puts on the fat suit and comes out the fat.  Anyone take this.  I'm just going to sit fat. 
[02:15:30]  Did you wonder why the music started  and they were shining a spotlight on your seat?  Because I'm fat, fat, fat.  Should I be really fat?  You know, I'm fat.  Did he ask you where you had yours made?  I'm fat, fat, fat.  Oh, come on.  I said, no.  Just hold me, punch you, roll me.  I'll stop and kill me once again.  Who's fat?  Does he come out in the suit, though?  Yeah?  Yeah, he comes out in the suit.  Yeah. 
[02:16:00]  Does he call you up to dance with him?  Bruce Springsteen did?  I have to explain it to you.  I'm not good.  I don't know if he plays this song.  Eric just said he comes out to fat.  I don't know.  Yeah.  This was a big one.  This was a big one.  This is, yeah.  What's your top five?  Well, I'm into lists lately.  What's your top five Weird Al fucking songs?  Go.  I'm in paradise.  No, I'm in paradise.  I'm in one of those.  It's an asshole. 
[02:16:30]  Smells like Nirvana's good.  You like that one?  How about one of his polka medleys?  The alternative polka is pretty good.  Is that on your list?  I'll put that on my list.  All right.  That's two.  We need three more.  All about the patio.  No, that's not it either.  I'm looking through his list.  Couch Potato is good.  Of course it is.  That's a parody of Eight Mile by Eminem.  What about...  You like his new stuff.  Shut the fuck up.  It's not about you. 
[02:17:00]  You like his new stuff.  You want to take over this segment too?  Go ahead.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  That's three, right?  I'm looking.  I'm looking.  What about I Lost on Jeopardy?  That's one of his old ones.  Yeah, yeah.  It's old hat to you.  I'm just thinking the old ones.  Eric, what year did you go to that concert, by the way?  Yeah, it's 2008.  No way.  It was the first one I ever went to.  So you don't even have an excuse that it was the 80s or something.  No, was that the year of your weight? 
[02:17:30]  We need two more.  I'm looking.  I'm looking.  Okay.  I think I'm a clone now.  You think I'm a clone now?  I think I'm alone now.  Of course.  I think I'm a clone now.  He's got a bunch of these polka medleys.  Another one.  Another one.  The buzz.  Didn't he do a tainted love goof?  No, I don't know.  It was about Magic Johnson. 
[02:18:00]  It was tainted blood.  That would have been a funny, weird-out parody.  How about like a surgeon?  Oh, six words long.  That one's a good one, too.  What's that about?  That was George Harrison's I Got My Mind Set On You.  You're like, uh, you're an obscure weird-out.  Because my mind turned to goo.  Fuck.  I forgot that song.  I Got My Mind Set On You. 
[02:18:30]  Oh, I think it's a lot.  So you haven't heard the new Weird Al song?  No, I haven't heard this new one.  Based on Lady Gaga.  Nope.  Did we get the last one from Eric?  I think so.  Yeah, I gave you five.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Her name gives me a boner.  I don't know why.  What name?  Lady Gaga.  Oh, okay.  I might know why.  We're missing a lot of really good Weird Al tracks, though.  Oh, which ones?  Another one rides the bus.  Living With a Hernia.  Living With a Hernia.  There was also Addicted to Spuds. 
[02:19:00]  Oh, right, right.  He was addicted to spuds.  Can I hear Living on a Hernia?  Is that based on Bon Jovi?  It's the James Brown song.  Yeah, it's Living in America.  Oh, never mind.  Oh, Living with a Hernia.  Here's Johnny, which was, remember Who's Johnny?  Back in the 80s.  It was all about Ed McMahon.  El de Barge.  Yeah.  He just blows.  That's what they call Iraq and Spain when he swims.  El de Barge. 
[02:19:30]  The funniest part of that, besides his obviously distress and humiliation, is all of the factors  that have to occur for him to get that name.  Like, he's never been in Spain, and would he swim, and would they actually swim?  It's like, he has to be in Spain swimming for that particular fat joke to work.  My favorite part is the sadness that appears on his face instantly after one of those lines.  I feel bad about it.  All right, here's the new Weird Al song called Perform This Way. 
[02:20:00]  And we got an expert, so you got to tell us if this is a good one.  Oh, yeah, smash or trash.  I also have a set list of around the time period that Eric went, so if we want to see what a set list would be from back then.  Oh, wow.  You want to see what the set list would be like?  We're looking at Polkarama.  He'd open up with that.  Canadian Idiot.  I guess that's a Green Day parody, huh?  Yeah.  Close But No Cigar. 
[02:20:30]  Bob, Alternative, Why Does This Always Happen to Me?  Those are his, like, original songs that he tries to play out with.  Really?  Oh, really.  Oh, does everybody just leave and take a piss and shit?  That's beer time, usually.  It's all about the Pentiums instead of the Benjamins.  You're Pitiful.  I guess that's You're Beautiful.  He does a whole production piece for that one, because he got in trouble with James Blunt over that song.  Yeah.  What kind of trouble?  He put it on one of his albums, and then he got sued to have it taken off, so before they released the album, he had to yank it off the actual... 
[02:21:00]  James Blunt is a cunt.  What a twat.  Exactly.  Another rhyme.  Jesus, you're natural at this.  Thank you, sir.  James Blunt is a cunt.  Thank you.  I'm the rhyming key.  Wow, there's a big anthem he does in the middle there.  A big medley.  Fucking awful James Blunt.  Fucking...  What a baby.  What did he ever do?  They don't hurt your songs to have them parodied.  I'll Sue Ya?  What's I'll Sue Ya?  I think that's another original.  Is that like...  Ew, he does originals?  Yeah, he makes his own...  Like, he does...  His CDs and stuff are a bunch of parodies, but he throws in like three or four of songs that are original that sound like they could be something else, but they're not parodies of anybody else. 
[02:21:30]  The saga begins, Yoda, Smells Like Nirvana.  Oh, we forgot about Yoda.  Amish Paradise.  What's Yoda?  It's a parody of Lola.  Yeah.  Can we hear a little bit of that?  Oh, God.  I think it's time for a big laugh on this program.  Oh, God.  I bet this is so bad because it's so old now.  Yeah.  Star Wars reference.  Ew, I'm going to douche out. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, no.  I met them in a swamp down in Dagobah where it bubbles all the time like a giant carbonated soda.  S-O-D-A soda.  What?  This doesn't make sense.  I saw the little red sitting there on a log.  I asked him his name and in a raspy voice.  He said Yoda.  Y-O-D-A Yoda.  Y-O-Y-O-Y-O-Y-O-D-A. 
[02:22:30]  Oh, God.  It's not that bad.  No, I can't tell you.  Laughing around, but I ain't ever seen a guy who looks like a Muppet, but he's wringled  and green on my Yoda.  Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo  Why does he always got the wacky voice going on?  It's like his wacky voice, guys.  Where are the jokes, though?  If you're going to do a parody song, you've got to have jokes in it.  He's just describing what happened in the movie.  John Valby does a parody song. 
[02:23:00]  Yes.  There's jokes.  You need jokes.  It sounds like the original song.  The words are just different.  Fucking Edmund Fitzgerald.  That's a parody.  Big one they call itchy.  Itchy-woomy.  Itchy-woomy.  That fucking parody is so great.  But that fucking Edmund Fitzgerald.  Everybody gang-banging this fucking chick. 
[02:23:30]  Fucking.  What did he say?  Something about, I didn't gripe that her twat looked like tripe,  but the smell of her feet really threw me.  That could be my favorite line that anybody's ever written.  Can we find that for the break?  That is a good one, man.  We played it recently, but it's fucking-  Who cares?  The smell of her feet really threw me.  This is a great-  I was all in with John Valby.  Dude, I love John Valby.  I think he's a genius.  What a weirdo, though.  Blew off our virus show to play some fucking barn in the middle of Pennsylvania. 
[02:24:00]  Of course.  He is a brute.  What's wrong with you?  He's crazy.  There was a point.  We had 10,000, 12,000 people for you to perform in front of.  He's crazy.  All right.  Here's the new Weird Al song, and we're going to do Smasher Trash with the expert.  Yes.  E-Rock is-  My mama told me when I was hatched, act like a superstar. 
[02:24:30]  Save your allowance by a bubble dress, and someday you will go far.  Now I'm made confidence, well, I'm hard to miss.  The press follows everywhere I go.  I'll poke your eye out with a dress like this.  Back off and enjoy the show.  I'm sure my critics will say it's a grotesque display. 
[02:25:00]  Well, they can fight me.  Baby, I perform this way.  I might be wearing Swiss cheese.  Oh, baby, covered with bees.  It doesn't mean I'm crazy.  I perform this way.  I don't know what's going on.  Yeah, I- 
[02:25:30]  Wait, did I-  What happened?  No, I'm not even kidding.  What happened?  Was there a joke in there?  No, Weird Al's just singing a song in the perspective of Lady Gaga.  Yeah, yeah, like, hey, I just performed this way.  I got caught up in the beat and then realized I wasn't even listening anymore.  Yeah.  Was there jokes in there?  Yes.  No, no, he's kind of talking about the way she performs, and she wears wacky things.  It's more like stating facts instead of making jokes.  And before we continue, I just checked my Twitter, Otto and George. 
[02:26:00]  Check it in.  And it is Otto and George on Twitter, a good one to follow.  Opie, Jim Norton, saw Weird Al last summer in Asbury Park.  Greatest concert I've ever seen.  Wow.  This is coming in from Otto.  And it's not being ironic.  I don't know.  We've got to get him on the phone.  Otto, if you've got the hotline number, call immediately, please.  Let's get back to Otto.  Pete handles him.  I bet you he is good live, honestly.  I want to know why Otto says greatest concert he's ever seen.  Well, it probably sounded exactly like the record.  And I also need to know what kind of concerts Otto goes to. 
[02:26:30]  Exactly.  Who else has Otto seen?  Yeah.  Otto slammed me yesterday.  It was perfect, too.  I retweeted it.  He just slammed me.  Why slam you?  Well, anybody slam you.  He said United Airlines in February lost George for two days.  And he goes, and that's my fucking livelihood.  He goes, buy some shorts and shut the fuck up.  Because my luggage has been missing for a few days.  Buy some shorts and shut up.  It was perfect.  Yeah, but I don't like you being spoken to. 
[02:27:00]  No, I don't either, Jim.  I've been falling this way.  I'll be a troll or evil queen.  I'll be a human jelly bean.  Because every day is Halloween.  Bean.  I'm so completely original.  My new look is all the rage.  Stage.  Stage.  Stage.  Stage.  Stage.  Stage.  And set fire to myself on stage.  Stage, Adam.  I wear a porcupine on my head. 
[02:27:30]  On a W-H-I-A-M.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  And for no reason, now I'll sing in French.  Excusez-moi, qu'est-ce que tu tees?  It's best to say, Adam.  Don't my safe jacket today.  It's made of gold and lemonade.  No, not because I'm crazy.  I perform this way.  I'll step my ribs to my feet.  Come on, myself would run me.  You know what?  If you didn't tell me, if I didn't know, I would have said this is a Scott and Todd subparity  that they played this morning. 
[02:28:00]  Oh, my God.  I know.  He ain't that bad.  Like, compared to Scott and Todd, at least he's, his stuff is better.  I'm just not feeling this, yo.  I don't know.  I'm not feeling this, yo.  We can't get Otto.  He's listening.  He's listening.  Just voicemail.  Fuck, maybe he'll explain on Twitter.  Also, someone's saying, Time Goat says that we're forgetting My Bologna.  Did we bring that one up?  Oh, yes.  My Bologna.  That was huge.  That was a biggie, huh?  E-Rock to you.  What do you think of the new Weird Al song? 
[02:28:30]  I would tell you, honestly, if I like it, it's okay.  It sounds like he's singing over an old MIDI file.  Oh, you don't like the quality.  MIDI file.  Not a MIDI file.  It's different.  I never felt the tight grip of a MIDI.  Hey, listen.  Yeah.  I guess you did a song for Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  Or a song that Anthony can relate to.  Really? 
[02:29:00]  Is there a song called Trigger Happy?  Yes, I am.  What is that about?  I hope he's brave and rhymes a trigger with something.  Sure.  Bigger.  Yeah.  That's exactly what I meant.  Much bigger gun.  Okay, got it.  Oh, good.  What is it based on?  Got an AK-47.  Well, you know it makes me feel all right.  Got an Uzi by my pillow.  Helps me sleep a little better at night.  There's no feeling any greater than to shoot first and ask questions later. 
[02:29:30]  Now I'm Trigger Happy, Trigger Happy every day.  Happy every day.  Well, you can't take my guns away.  I got a constitutional right.  Yeah, I gotta be ready if the commies attack us tonight.  Commies?  How old is this?  I don't know.  We got Otto on the line, though.  Otto.  Otto.  From Otto and George.  Otto.  Otto, fellas.  I just read your tweet, and I wasn't sure if you were, like, being an asshole or not. 
[02:30:00]  You really thought it was the best concert you ever saw?  I really saw Weird Al Yakovic.  It was really great.  He put on that fat suit from the video, and it's pretty cool.  All the guys in the band would do costume changes, like, when we had Amish.  I don't know what we call it, Amish.  Yeah.  It was really entertaining, right?  And it sounded really good?  Yeah.  I mean, it's like, it was just fun. 
[02:30:30]  It was goofy shit.  But, um, it was probably Alan Sherman, who wrote a lot more complicated, brilliant-type  parodies.  Weird Al just kind of changes one thing and goes with it.  Yeah, yeah.  Brilliant, entertaining guy.  How about Valby, though?  Valby does great parodies.  Valby's amazing.  He's very, he doesn't get the credit he deserves.  I agree.  Very underrated.  Filthy animal.  I love him.  Yeah, he's a filthy animal, and he's very topical. 
[02:31:00]  I would see Weird Al just to do it, like, just before I, because I would trash him,  but then I'm listening to all these songs, and I'm like, it's not my style, but, eh,  you can't say he's untalented.  I mean, it is entertaining.  It's not making me laugh, but I'm like, I'm like.  You mean he's made a few bucks over the years with it?  Yeah, it's like, it's, I guess, just different.  That's for sure.  I'll amend my statements about Weird Al Stingy.  Right, and, uh.  How do you say these things?  Well, you know.  Yeah, I just judge everything, because I'm a prick.  And he wants to remind us all that he won a few Grammys, too, for his song. 
[02:31:30]  Well, he did.  Yes, he did.  Under what category?  Comedy, I'm sure.  Comedy?  Comedy.  Which is sick, dude.  Comedy.  Comedy.  Hey, uh, Otto, I.  Yeah, the novelty, the novelty LP, man.  You have to go, for sure, you know?  Yeah, huh?  Yeah, I think so.  Hey, hey, hey, Otto, I, uh, I read your tweet yesterday.  You actually lost George in, uh, luggage?  Delta lost George.  I, I take care of my, please, my bread and butter.  My bread and butter, huh? 
[02:32:00]  Hey, so I bet George is flying the plane or something.  No, Chip.  I just got some fucking colored bag of hand, bag of hand, brought him home to his kid, you  know?  Oh.  And, you know, I figure the longer he's out of my possession, I'm not going to get him  back.  Yep.  It was stupid.  But they, uh, they, um, they, they made me miss a connecting flight coming back from  Edmonton, Canada.  And then they said, all right, we're going to put you in this hotel, uh, and then we're 
[02:32:30]  going to, um, get you on the earliest flight the next day.  So I, I got one of those luggage cards and they went, no, no, we'll take care of the bags.  Ah.  I should have put them right on the plane.  I should have never listened to them.  I should have, you know, taken them back with me.  I learned my lesson that time.  But, um, it worked out okay.  Not a big deal.  It didn't make the wires.  The wires.  Anytime they tell you they'll take the bag or something, I'm always leery about that.  Oh, I do.  Those baggage handlers?  I never let those fuckheads touch my bags. 
[02:33:00]  No.  Never.  Did you tip them?  You mean, you mean when you first get to the airport?  Yeah, I always tip them, yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, I never let them touch my bags.  I always have problems.  Do it yourself.  Do it yourself.  I don't know.  Do it that way.  I had a big, long vacation this time, but I'm usually a carry-on guy.  I could get along for about a week on just my stupid carry-on.  Sorry, I'm just, um, well, coffee went down the wrong pipe.  That'll happen.  So you went on a cruise and you jogged around the deck with red buttons? 
[02:33:30]  Red buttons?  Red buttons.  And he didn't jog.  He wasn't jogging, Otto.  He was speedwalking.  Speedwalk.  Okay.  Jesus.  I was thinking about that shit when I was on there, though.  Some old red buttons speedwalking around there.  Pete Hathaway and his bad hair looped in that fucking movie.  The loop from hell was funny.  That movie was awful.  What movie?  Poseidon Adventure. 
[02:34:00]  I liked it.  For the time, come on.  Oh, God.  I had much more emotional investment in those characters than fucking DiCaprio and that fat  cunt on those things.  I had Titanic.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's true.  I would have to agree with Otto.  I didn't care about them.  He gave a shit that Shelly Winner's heart seized up after she held a breath.  Fucking, uh, what's her name?  Stella Stevens died.  Oh, Stella Stevens was hot in that.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  She looked good in that.  And the other one, too. 
[02:34:30]  The one that was in, uh, she was, uh, what the hell was she?  She laid her, uh, uh, younger baby?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She was in that show, uh, The Mysteries.  Um, she was too.  I get it, Chip.  Yeah, whatever the fuck her name was.  Nancy Drew.  Nancy Drew.  Really?  Yes.  I was just fucking around.  She was Nancy Drew.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Well, I got one finally.  I like the Hardy Boys.  I used to read all their books.  I used to pretend I was Chip Hardy.  Chip Hardy.  And I was solving the Hardy Boy mysteries for them. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah?  Like, they would get something and they would farm it out to me.  They would farm it out to Chip.  And they would pay me in Krugerrands.  Krugerrands.  And I would solve their mysteries, the Hardy Boys.  How many Krugerrands you got?  Millions.  There's a lot of money now.  I was solving the Hardy Boy mysteries.  And me and Nancy Drew is dating.  I think you're lying.  No, I'm not.  But I would recommend checking out Weird Out.  Not to Jim, per se, but the average person.  It's better than stand-up.  It's not a guy just talking, you know? 
[02:35:30]  Yeah.  Very cool.  I don't like so.  Weird Out.  It seems everybody that's seen him likes him.  So who the fuck are we to say?  We're the stupid ones.  Yeah.  Otto, where are you going to be?  Any plugs?  Yeah.  I'm going to be back at my old stomping grounds, the brokerage.  Okay.  Next Friday.  Nice.  Next Friday, there with the paper gangsters.  With all my little buddies out there in Long Island.  Very cool.  All right, buddy.  See you soon, buddy.  I had a fucking 10-hour factory day yesterday to drive to fucking Connecticut to perform for 
[02:36:00]  fucking shit, fucking bikers in some fucking place out there.  Jesus.  It was horrible.  Yeah.  And it's a Wednesday night.  It's like, come on.  Nobody's going to come out.  Nobody's going to come out on a Wednesday.  Yeah, that's tough.  It's a stupid night.  I like the dog impression that George does.  Yeah, George is barking like a dog, huh?  Yeah, he's over there barking like he's tree barking or something.  I can't tell you.  Joey. 
[02:36:30]  That's my dog, Sal, because he's all in the neighborhood.  See you, buddy.  All right, Otto.  Later, Otto.  All right.  Take care, guys.  Take care, buddy.  Otto and George on Twitter.  I have a plug I forgot to give.  Yeah.  And it's a favor from one of my dear friends.  Yeah.  That's actually for a girl I've been fucking.  What?  She's going to be appearing at Foxwoods this weekend.  It was supposed to be on this show today, but she had to cancel because she's in Connecticut.  And doing press up there, so she had to cancel our show. 
[02:37:00]  But she was going to come in and surprise everybody.  Yeah.  Bubuckley.  Oh, oh, right.  I remember you talking about this.  Bubuckley.  Lovely lady.  Who I've been sleeping with.  She's going to be at Foxwoods.  Yeah.  She's very high energy.  Yeah.  She's very funny as a comedian.  She has a movie called Cheat at the Tribeca Film Festival.  Yes.  And she's really doing a lot of great things. 
[02:37:30]  Very good.  So if you want to see Bubuckley, she fucks immediately.  All you got to do is, what you do is, here's the trick.  You take a little cookie, and you smoosh it between your fingers, and you rub it on your  zipper.  Yeah.  And then Bubba will lean over and just eat it off like a bird.  Wow.  So if you want to go see her in Foxwoods.  Foxwoods.  I don't know if she's there tonight, but I know she's there tomorrow.  I think tonight through Sunday, actually.  Wow. 
[02:38:00]  Very good.  Okay.  Hey, we're going to go to break.  I think we got Danielle Harris coming in today.  Wow.  Oh, good.  See, I didn't put the name together with the girl there.  Yeah, we'll talk to her.  She's pretty, right?  Yeah, she's pretty.  She was in the last Boy Scout.  She's fucking dishy.  I liked her as the neighbor in Roseanne.  I get so nervous when pretty girls come.  She was the neighbor in Roseanne.  Really?  Yeah. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, Jimmy.  Why, dude?  Why?  Because my nervous...  That's what happened when some pretty girls were around.  Oh, God.  Why do you have to pull your pants down and spread your cheeks?  I just didn't want you to think I was a faker.  Okay.  Anthony, we're going to go to break for people that like the band Muse.  I talked about this earlier.  We got it.  James Durbin.  He has Tourette's, I guess.  And he's the rock guy in American Idol.  And I happened to watch American Idol because I had family over blah, blah, blah. 
[02:39:00]  Why did they let the handicapped people do things?  Instead of watching a great hockey game, I was stuck watching Idol.  And it wasn't that bad.  And James Durbin did a great job with The Uprising, a song by Muse.  So we'll play it at the break.  All right.  Him doing it on Idol.  Take a listen.  Tell me what you think.  Okay?  All right.  Three, four.  Three, four.  Three, four.  Three, four.  Three, four.  Three, four.  Three, four.  Three, four.  Three, four.  Three, four.  Three, four.  Three, four.  Three, four. 
[02:39:30]  It's going to be a transmission towards them.  We'll try to push drugs to keep us all dumbed down, and hope that we should never see the truth  go around.  Another promise, another scene, another package lie to keep us trapped in greed with all the  green belts wrapped around our minds.  An endless red tape to keep the truth confined.  They will not force us 
[02:40:00]  They will stop degrading us  They will not control us  We will be victorious  Come on! 
[02:40:30]  Lies of the King, the power back in summer  Fat cats had a heart attack  You know that their time's coming to an end  We have to unify and watch our flag of sand  They will not force us  They will stop degrading us 
[02:41:00]  They will not control us  We will be victorious  Come on!  The Canuck girls came round from Chippewa on down 
[02:41:30]  There was a big one they call Ichiwumi  Now I didn't gripe that her twat looked like trite  But the smell of her feet really threw me  The crew came on deck with their peckers erect  Going down on a hefty Hispanic  I was second in line of 109  Less men went down on the Titanic  Two laddies came in 
[02:42:00]  She was doing her nails  So she jerked them both off with her right foot  Her boyfriend had the hot  So he pumped 29 shots  In the ass of that bag cord and white foot  I cruised down the street  Saw some faggots in heat  Edmund was hung double barrel  Jerry had two little holes in his butt  I just love the way Edmund Fitzgerald 
[02:42:30]  I just love the way Edmund Fitzgerald  The O.B. and Anthony Show  The O.B. and Anthony Show, damn it!  On the virus, Sirius XM  O.B. and Anthony  Let's get the pretty girl in here

I knew you  Four and five when I was a kid  Oh, okay  And then Rob Zombie's one and two  How was it?  Did you do any scenes with Malcolm McDowell?  Oh, I saw it years ago  Yeah, yeah  Malcolm's awesome  Isn't he great?  I have a little crush on Malcolm McDowell  Yeah  Would you? 
[02:44:00]  Come on  Maybe  You would, right?  Maybe  Well, that's what a crush means, isn't it?  No, but a crush can be different  It doesn't have to be like  Would you sleep with him?  I mean, I've had crushes on women that I didn't want to sleep with  With Malcolm?  Really?  Oh  I would fuck Malcolm  I'd have to  I'll just ask him to keep doing clockwork lines  You gotta have sex with a guy that did clockwork  I mean  It's the accent  Yeah  It's not gay, by the way  Because, you know, it's clockwork  Yeah, whatever  Is he charismatic, like, to be around?  How do people, people kind of treat him like royalty on the set? 
[02:44:30]  No  No?  No  He's kind of, you know, he's just like a fun, normal, you know, kind of woman-loving, feisty Englishman  Did he flirt with you?  Of course  Yeah  Did he give you, like, little hugs?  I think he flirted with everybody  Did he touch your hips for a little bit too long?  No  No  No  No  No  We'll push it to you a little too much  Burt Reynolds has done that to me, though  Really?  Not the hips, but he used to massage my shoulders and call me Cupcake, yes  Really?  Did you like it, or was it creepy?  No, it was creepy  Would you look in the mirror at his fucking wig line and go, all right, Burt 
[02:45:00]  Wait, what movie was that for?  It was a movie of the week I did years ago, and I think I was, like, 18, too, so it was  a little weird  Oh  Yeah, for TNT back a little while ago  It was called Hard Time Hostage Hotel  Nice  Yeah  That sounds dangerous  Wow, it's cool  I bet you the title of it, they bet somebody, you can't get three H's into a title  So, I never saw that one, but now I want to see that one to see you and know that you  were happy  Nah, not so much  Not so much  Were they good massages, at least? 
[02:45:30]  Well, I don't know, that was a little weird  Not really?  Not really  Did he, uh, would he press his body against you while he massaged his shoulders?  Oh, God, no, thank God  Of course  But weren't you kind of like, hey, this guy is, it's Burt Reynolds, it's sexy, it's Burt  It would have been sexy if it was a long time ago, but  Is that what he was like?

Because his Halloweens are very good  He's a really interesting director  Yes, I love him, he's great  I just saw him in concert, actually, with Alice Cooper a couple months ago  Oh, wow  It was weird to see him on stage being the performer  Because I'm so used to him being behind the camera  Yeah, it was crazy  He's a great performer  Yeah, he's phenomenal  Amazing  Yeah  Is he always dusty?  He looks dusty all the time  Yeah  You know, I don't know  We're filming kind of, you know, where there's a lot of dirt and blood and stuff  So he was a little dusty

It's, uh, it's this really cool, uh, gritty indie sort of post-apocalyptic road trip vampire movie  Oh, cool  That's kind of like a coming-of-age story  It's more about relationships  And, uh, I got to work with Kelly McGillis, who's super cool  And Nick DiMici, who's like the coolest New Yorker I know  You do mostly horror movies  I guess so  You know, I didn't, I did, you know, I didn't do them for like 20 years  And then I, Rob Zombie kind of re-  I know you're looking at me like, how old are you? 
[02:48:00]  Yeah  Um, Rob Zombie kind of brought that back a little bit  So for the last couple of years I've sort of found my, my way back into that world  What was the last horror movie you did?  Was it the mustache in the massage chair?  I don't know  That was, that was, that was, that was, that was, that was, that was only scary in real life  Um, the last horror movie I did was, well, Hatchet 2 came out on a video a couple months ago  I did a movie called The Victim  Oh, I love it  There, there's the Hatchet, yeah  I did a movie called, uh, The Victim

[02:51:30]  It was a 30 minute short or whatever  And there's one scene  Where I have to scream a lot  And it fucking changed my  I screamed so many takes  That it blew my voice  Why did you have to do that many takes?  Um, it was just  Uh-oh  Louis  Fucking  I was screaming  It was, it was, it was about two vaudeville comedians  That were too filthy to ever make it  And, uh, this  In this one scene  I have to scream  Because there's a flying dildo  In the, a dildo with bat wings 
[02:52:00]  And I go like  Ah!  And it shoots into my mouth  And, uh  That's a fucking  Class film  Where can I find this?  It's all over  It's a big, it's a big movie  I gotta say it  It was a good film  It was funny  It was a really good film  Yeah  Yes  Yeah, big, uh  Absolutely  Big Dick and Little Bert  I think were our names in the film  1999 we did it actually  Well written  But, uh, yeah  That's why I had to keep redoing takes  Because then it had to be pulled out  And made to reverse it  Like it's shot in  Oh my god  High tech stuff  Spielberg  How did, uh  Yeah  How did, how did you get into, uh 
[02:52:30]  Films and stuff as a kid?  Because you've been in for many years  You know, I was a beauty pageant girl  Were you like  One of those little Miss Perfect kind of  Mmm, no  I've always been a little rebellious  Did you have to put on wow wear?  Yeah, I did actually  Dance around like that  I would, uh  I would  My talent was clogging  Clogging?  Yes  Ah, yeah  Awesome  I mean  Retarded  But this was  This was in the 80s  So, you know  We weren't doing the spray tan  And all that crap  Yeah, yeah  I mean, I still had pink rollers  And eyeshadow at five 
[02:53:00]  Which is ridiculous  But  It was clogging  But it was blue and pink  It's like this sort of  I lived in Florida  But I also grew up in New York  So you wear little crinoline skirts  And it's sort of like  A type of tap dancing  Can you do a little of that for us?  I don't remember  Come on  Jeez  It is like  But you're pulling up my dress  Screaming for you guys  You're small enough  We can put you right up  On the counter here  You can do some clogging  I probably could actually  Clogging  I was always told  I was a great clogger  But not for that reason  Oh, no  You don't want to know  Toilet joke  Yeah, of course  Of course 
[02:53:30]  It is a toilet joke  Too much information  Why wouldn't it be  I'm sorry, Daniel  And then what happened?  Somebody saw you  And was like  You know, I won a beauty pageant  That took me to New York  Actually  And a talent agency  Asked to sign me  And we relocated  And I started working  I worked on a soap opera  That, you know  All the soaps are getting cancelled now  Which is crazy  Yeah  Why are they cancelled?  They just cancelled two major ones  Yeah, they cancelled  All My Children and One Life to Live  Why?  Because nobody's watching TV anymore  I think it's more of an older demo  That was going on  With that whole thing  Snoop likes them, by the way  One Life to Live  One Life to Live  Yeah 
[02:54:00]  Back in what years?  I don't know  Somewhere in the late 80s  Late 80s?  You were young, though  I was young, yeah  I was more a dazed person back then  When Marlena was always in danger  Oh, Stefano Demira  Oh, wow  Stefano Demira was always trying to get Marlena  It was terrible  Oh, my gosh  I'm like queers  Oh, please  Please  I was the worst  What was the one where the lady got possessed by fucking the devil?  That was Marlena, too  That was terrible  Yeah, yeah  With the little guy 
[02:54:30]  That was on for a long time  Yeah, yeah, yeah  You know  You were in that  And then you get out of that  And you get into doing some movies and TVs  You did Roseanne, obviously  I did, yeah  Remember that?  I did  I did a movie of the week with Rosie and Tom  In Ottumwa, Iowa  Ooh, what'd you see there?  The woman who loved Alba  Oh, lots of big things  Ooh, I don't doubt it  Wow, from the bios I've seen on them  Ooh, boy  Boy, there was some weirdness going on with those two  They were super cool with me, though  So she brought me on the show  I thought it was going to be an episode  And I did a season  Wow 
[02:55:00]  Yeah, yeah  Were they trying to get you into the sack with them?  Jesus  She was a kid at the time  I do have a good story about that, though  It was  I've never told this before  It was Tom's and Rosie's  Or maybe it was his birthday  So Rosie hired this woman to come in with this guy  To teach you how to strip for your man  And we closed off the set  And it was like Laurie Metcalf, Sandra Bernhard  A couple of us  Rosie, myself  And this woman  I mean, she just went for it  And then when they left  I was 16 
[02:55:30]  My mom knew I was there, obviously  It was on set  Someone called Child Protective Services  And they showed up on set  And busted my mom's balls  And she was like  I gave her permission  Damn, what a rat  I know, right?  Roseanne was freaking out  So I learned how to strip for my man  Watching Roseanne do a demo  And I'm not doing it right now  No, no, but do you  Do you do it for your boyfriend?  You know, I've been taking pole dancing classes  For about six years now  Whoa  So I don't do it for my 
[02:56:00]  He's wanting me to  But he always has to be a fly on the wall  In that classroom  Could you pole dance for us?  Yeah  If there was a pole, I could have  Yeah  Bring in Kenny  Oh, crap  Wearing different attire, of course  How long have you been with the same gentleman?  I've only been with him for about seven months  But we did a movie together years ago  So I've known him for a long time  Oh, really?  He's in the business  They're all in the business  Are they?  I try to not date actors  It doesn't work  Yeah?  How about radio?  How about radio guys?  Never done that before  Yeah, well 
[02:56:30]  Hey, out of respect  I want to ask you something  But I'm going to write it  Okay  Write it  It should be like  Do you like me?  Check yes or no  I didn't even know  Will you be my boyfriend?  I didn't know he could write  This is amazing  It's amazing  I mean, if we didn't like her  Then we would just do whatever  Blindside her?  Oh, yeah, that's fine  Oh, okay  Sure  Because when she was on Roseanne  It's a big story  She had a stalker  Yeah, yeah  And it's kind of got  Oh, yeah  I got one now 
[02:57:00]  And we all have had situations in the past  I think women are probably even worse than men  Oh, my God  They're crazy  Yeah, they're crazy  Totally crazy  So it was back in 1995  When you were on Roseanne?  Yeah, I was on Roseanne  And, you know, I've always played  Kind of the sassy, trashy, feisty girl  So I think that's sort of what started it  And he's a horror fan anyway  And then, you know, about a year ago  Thanks to Twitter  Which I'm a huge Twitter fan  And, you know, Facebook and all that stuff  Started sort of sending me stuff  As well online  And I was like, this is really weird  This guy's saying weird stuff  He knows more than I think he should know 
[02:57:30]  Oh, shit  So I kind of had to, you know, go through the whole process again  But I hadn't had any issues for a really long time  Wait, it's the same guy from 95?  Mm-hmm  Wow, that's dedication  I know, I know  Great, that's what I have to look forward to  But, you know, it hasn't been a problem  And everything's fine now  And, you know, thanks to a three-year restraining order  And all that jazz  Wow, really?  It says he showed up at your home with a shotgun  He did  And a teddy bear?  Yeah  Aw  Oh, I mean, wait a minute  That's horrifying 
[02:58:00]  I have such a hatred of stalkers  Like, such a  We should be able to do more  Once they've proven that there are pests or whatever  They're not going to stop  They're just fucking despicable  You know, I didn't think it was going to be that big of an issue  I just actually moved  And I rented my house out  And my tenants googled my name  We never talked about what I did for a living  And called me and said  I'm a little worried  You have a stalker?  And I was like, no, no, no  It's not  It's really not that bad anymore  Yeah  Thank God  What's your Twitter name?  Halloween Gal  Oh, wow, I was way off 
[02:58:30]  Daniel Harris  Oh, you tried that?  Yeah  Halloween Gal  Halloween Gal  Yeah  I thought it was fitting  Yeah, yeah, yeah  It's kind of a cool name  So are you doing a third Halloween?  No, I'm dead  Finally  Yeah, you're dead  You're cadavers  You see the three old people that just walk by  Jesus Christ  What do you think?  Wait, wait, wait  Hold on  Oh, was it?  I didn't even say it  I just saw the two  The boss  Oh, okay, well  Hold on, yeah  What do you think of this?  Let me  Let me play this one first  This is an actual voicemail from his stalker 
[02:59:00]  And this is plenty  How do I have your number?  No, that's Sal  That's terrible  I got your bag  I'm not your stalker  Hey  I'm just calling to apologize  And in a way, thank you  At times I've been angry  And regretted meeting you  And the heart that you have caused me  And tried to cause me  But I've decided to take all that  And turn it into something good  And I bet someone who's actually a recovering alcoholic 
[02:59:30]  And has given me some insight on myself  Better life  And kind of insight on the whole situation  And if I truly did the right thing for me  And you at the time  And it seems I did the right thing  Did you have a relationship with her?  No  Have you ever met her before?  Yeah, yeah  This was a  It was a one night flingy kind of thingy 
[03:00:00]  That  This is a year later  I'm still getting this  A year later  And texts every day  Bing, bing, bing  Just texts every day  Woo  Oh my god  About how, you know  Just move on  Move on  And I'm like  Move on  You're the one texting me all the time  I just want to move on with my life  Stop it  Don't message her back  No, that's what everybody says  Are you messaging her back?  I message back  I talk about it on the radio  I'm like  Screw it  She loves it  But it's been going like a year 
[03:00:30]  So I'm just like  I don't want to talk shit  Because then she's going to start coming after me  Yeah, that's true  You bitch  You showed him my tattoo  Your tattoo  Trying to pole dance for my man  He's flat  I can see it now  Oh god  There is no connection there  I will stalk you if this happens  To me  I swear to God  Well that would be a plus at least  I could absolutely be stalked by worse  That's for sure  Oh my god  You have a great resume  You have a lot of stuff 
[03:01:00]  Yeah  Wowee  Yeah  Thanks guys  I know  I've watched you for like years  Not from afar  Not through a window or anything  What was your favorite project?  My favorite project  Oh god  You know  I think one of the most fun to watch  Which is a movie I did when I was a kid  Called The Last Boy Scout  Oh yeah  That's why we were about to talk about that  Yeah  I think that's a movie that I  Every time I come to  And I did a movie called  Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead 2  Back in the 80s  So they just don't make movies like that anymore  That's right  You were in that 
[03:01:30]  Holy shit  Boy Scout was amazing though  Because that was Bruce Willis  Yeah  And Damon Wayans  Back when  I mean  Back when I was like build-up up before Halle Berry  It was crazy  A long time ago  To work with  I mean  Bruce Willis obviously is an amazing action hero  Yeah  To a lot of people  What did you learn from his acting chops?  What was it like working with him at such a young age?  Was he difficult?  Was he fun?  He just tortured me the whole time  As in like ball busting?  Yeah he just busted me  They would throw like food candy  He just  He came up to me one day  And said  Hey kid 
[03:02:00]  Don't upstage me  This is my fucking movie  And he meant it  I think he maybe did  I didn't know that  I didn't you know  What that meant  Back in the day  He probably meant it  It's funny  I found Bruce to be  Kind of helpful  On the set  Oh well  When Jimmy  Warned with Bruce Willis  I found him to be very daunting actually  And very careful  Yeah  Making sure I wasn't injured  Yeah  I ran into him at a bar  About six or seven years ago  I hadn't seen him since I was a kid  And I was outside  And he walked by  And I just went like  Hey  Hey  How are you?  And he looked at me 
[03:02:30]  And said  I'm good  I'm good  How are you?  And I said  I'm really good  And he walked inside  And I had not had any idea  That he played his daughter  So I stood at the end of the bar  And I was like  God this guy's gotta recognize me  And then eventually  He came over to me  And was like  How's your mom?  I said  Oh she's good  We're good  So we were cool  He doesn't give a shit  About your mom  He just probably had  An awkward moment  Like you know  When the time  We live in the same building  And I was going to get  On the elevator  And he walked up  With his girlfriend  And they walked  On to an elevator 
[03:03:00]  Or I was about  To walk on the elevator  And they purposely  Walked on to another one  That I wasn't getting on  Yeah  And he saw me  Creepily look at him  I would do that too  But you did a scene  But you did a scene with him  Yeah but it wasn't  He did a tattoo scene  It was before that  Oh  I think it was before that  How'd you like  Working with him?  Well I was saying  He's very good  It was  Look you guys got  Something in common  We certainly do  Run with it a little bit  Well  Coaching him  I had to have  A tattoo needle  Held right over my eye  And I actually had to yell too  We have a lot in common  And Bruce made sure 
[03:03:30]  They built something  On the chair for me  So I didn't slip  And get something in my eye  And sue him  So he probably  Yes that was probably  Very smart  Yeah  But as actors  We can discuss this  Well of course you can  Yeah we'll just sit back  Discuss everything  Except what to do  With your hands  When you're acting  Oh no need to humiliate me  In front of the beautiful eyes  One of the problems  Has that been a question?  Yes  Constantly  What do I do with my hands?  Like I don't know what to do  Like I do this a lot  And for those of you  You can't see me on the radio  But I'm flopping them forward  For no reason at all  I do this every other word 
[03:04:00]  So I'm like  So it's really been  Really happy to have you  Like that  Terrible  And you just have to  Hold yours up  And go  And scream  And scream  Yeah  It's very scary  Block a knife  Pulling someone's hands  Off my throat  Yeah yeah  That kind of stuff  Yeah  That's pretty cool  What do you do like  When you're not  When you're not acting  What do you just do for fun?  What do I do?  Oh god  I've got dogs  And I'm a big cook  And love to entertain  And you know  All that  You hang around the house?  I do  I totally hang around 
[03:04:30]  I know it sounds  Really glamorous  No no  It's great  It's what I love to do  I do laundry  I watch bad TV  You know  Oh this is fantastic  I make chicken soup  Oh I love chicken soup  This is the best ever  Jesus  We got a problem  I just tweeted a picture of you  And of course you want a lot of followers  At Halloween Gal  They're not happy with the photo I took  Why?  Oh me right now  Oh god  Can we get a tattoo pic?  They've already seen it  But Jimmy can hold up the skirt  And we can 
[03:05:00]  We can do a little thing  I can't  Can I?  Nah nah  I wouldn't  They're not happy with the picture  I'm not holding up her  Would that be fine?  What are they saying?  They want  They know you're hot  And I guess I didn't capture the hotness  Because the mic's in the way  Yeah but dude  Me holding up her skirt  Is just weird right?  Can he hold up the skirt  Like and then maybe you  Go like this  And you know  Nah dude  Can we do a little something?  She's not going to want that  Will you?  I probably  Nah I just  I don't want to do anything  That's going to make her uncomfortable  Unless she'd be comfortable with that  You give me a better shot 
[03:05:30]  And of course  And of course I'll tweet  Halloween Gal in my tweet  And then you get some followers out of this  Alright I'll do a little  You can do a little peek  A little oopsies  A little oopsie  Nah but I'm probably bad  You're talking me into stuff  That I normally do  Just like that wicked grin  I'm not going to hold her  Unless you watch me too  I can hold it up  Yeah she can  You can just sort of be in the vicinity  Oh Jimmy  No no  Only if she wants  I would never be presumptuous enough  To hold her skirt  That's a great tat man  It really is  You want Jimmy in? 
[03:06:00]  No she can  You don't want to be in it?  My leg is really nice too  How does that look okay?  Now you've got to look in the camera  Alright here we go  Beautiful  Oh no it got a little blurry  One more time  Go the long way you nut job  Then what happens?  You get the more  More of the head  Alright here we go  Yeah  One two  She's head to  Beautiful  She's what we call  Head to toe cute  How did this show  Get so creepy?

[03:06:30]  I'm taking pictures of  I know Steakland  Holding up my dress  Looking sexy  At the camera  This has been a complete  Waste of time  Unless we get the word out  For Steakland  Steakland  Out on video on demand  And we are  IFC and the premieres tomorrow  Comes out in New York tomorrow  And then I think next week  It's like LA  Maybe a couple of other places  Chicago, Florida  That kind of  And what are you doing in Tribeca too?  You have a film in Tribeca as well  I thought it was going to be in Tribeca  My friend Jennifer Blanc  Michael Biehn  You know Michael Biehn is right?

I thought you said directed Roda  I was like, oh, give a shit  It's an old show  Sorry, Daniel  So yeah, the victim  So that's probably where the tattoo picture  Because I play this awesome  You know, coke head stripper chick  So  In what?  In the victim  Okay  But not in Steakland  Steakland I play much nicer  I play Belle  Which is very fitting  Very different  I play all kinds of random things 
[03:07:30]  You play a pregnant mom in this?  I do  And what is your  It's a horror movie?  It is  It's not really a horror movie  I mean, it's a vampire movie  But vampires are scary  And it's kind of the end of the world  And they've taken over  So is right wing America  I love that end of the world shit  It's really good  It's really great  Good storyline  Did you say right wing America?  Yeah  Yeah, I was frustrated with that shit too  What?  Michael Cerverus, who's awesome  Plays Jebediah  Who's this wicked, wicked character  You got something in common  You hate the fact that right wing America  Is taking over the fucking country 
[03:08:00]  And says she's the same  No, no  I'm fiscally conservative  Yet morally liberal  Yeah  You're fiscally conservative  And morally Nazi  Oh no  He's not like us  He's not like an artist like us  No, that's crazy  You're talking about things like  Hanging out, watching bad TV  And laughing and stuff  That's all I do  It's great  Will you be our friend?  Yeah, you should be our friend  I will be your friend  I have very few 
[03:08:30]  We're already friends  I know, but I have very few celebrity friends  A man of my status should have a lot more  Should we all exchange numbers now?  Or you just want to do that after the interview?  Probably after  After, we'll just like  Are you LA girl?  I'm LA, yeah  You're LA?
