<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Sam Roberts hosting a "Worst of the Week Countdown" segment.  This was followed by a segment featuring in-studio guests Charlie Day, David Spade, Judge Alex, and James Cromwell.  A significant portion of the show involved Opie and Anthony quizzing two female interns, Jackie (born 1992) and Sidney (born 1994), on their knowledge of classic 70s and 80s television shows like *The Facts of Life*, *Happy Days*, *The Wonder Years*, and *Good Times*. Their lack of familiarity led to humorous discussions about generational differences in viewing habits.  The hosts also discussed Rock Hudson's death and AIDS awareness in relation to this segment.  The interns were assigned homework: watch an episode of *Quincy, M.E.* and write a book report.  Their (and a surprisingly submitted male intern Jerry’s) reports were read on air, leading to further discussion of the show's stylistic choices. Jerry was tasked with getting Slurpees as punishment/reward for his unexpected participation.

A lengthy interview with James Cromwell followed.  The conversation began with lighthearted banter about Cromwell's home-building skills (or lack thereof), followed by discussions about his acting career, including anecdotes about IMDB inaccuracies and a near-miss role on *All in the Family* where he was considered to kill off Archie Bunker. Cromwell discussed the differences between network and cable television, citing the limitations of network standards and practices compared to the freedom of cable, mentioning Rod Serling's insights on sponsor influence.  He also talked about his experiences on the ABC drama "Betrayal," and offered his perspective on the Trayvon Martin/George Zimmerman and Casey Anthony trials, providing detailed legal analysis and personal anecdotes from his time as a police officer and legal observer.  The interview concluded with lighter discussion about the comically bad Syfy channel movies *Sharknado*, *Dino Shark*, and *Mansquito*.

The show then shifted to a heavy focus on *Sharknado*, with listener Stevie Knight providing clips. This transitioned into Anthony's recounting of a disastrous 4th of July party featuring Bobo, an autistic listener who became highly intoxicated, exposing himself on the "Compound Show" live stream and engaging in other erratic behavior (vomiting, jumping in the pool fully clothed with a hamburger).  Videos of Bobo's antics, provided by Big A, were discussed and shown.  Interviews with David Spade (promoting *Grown Ups 2*) and Jim Florentine (promoting his podcast "Comedy Metal Visions") followed.  Spade discussed his experiences with the press and his childhood, while Florentine's interview was interspersed with advertisements.

The next segment started with a discussion about a recent movie premiere, mentioning the presence of Chris Farley's brother. This transitioned into a discussion about excessive online photo sharing, specifically of children. The host shared an embarrassing prom night story and discussed marriage and divorce rates, focusing on Arizona, and the impact of divorce on children. He detailed his difficult childhood, experiences with his father and stepfather (including receiving a shotgun at age 10), and his lack of success with women. Charlie Day (*It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia*, *Horrible Bosses*) then joined as a guest.  Their conversation included Day's experiences with British actors, his acting career (including a negative experience with a Thomas' Bagels commercial), his role in *Pacific Rim* (compared favorably to *Sharknado*),  a memorable line delivered to Mary Tyler Moore, and his time working with Danny DeVito.  Jim Florentine's podcast commentary on wedding DJs played in the background, focusing on overplayed songs, unwanted attire, children at weddings, and the awkwardness of wedding speeches.

A caller then recounted his frustrating experiences with his wife's wedding planning.  He used highly offensive language to express his dislike for various wedding traditions, the Catholic ceremony length, the cash bar, and his wife’s self-centeredness.  He detailed his experiences DJing weddings and his disdain for requests.  He also shared stories about sending obscene photos at weddings and creatively avoiding being a best man.  This segment included numerous advertisements for Simply Paid, Andro 400, Fresh Balls, and Florida Cancer Specialists,  and mentioned Chris Weidman and Cher as recent SiriusXM guests.

Here's your host, what's his name?  Worst of the Week Countdown time. 
[00:03:30]  Yep, it's me, Sam Roberts, counting down the great things that happened on this week's Opie and Anthony show.  So, I'm the one who hosts this show because it's a show.  And they figure, well, Sam should be the one hosting it because nobody else will.  This was a big week for the Opie and Anthony show.  We're going to count down on this show.  We'll hear of Charlie Day from Always Sunny in studio.  David Spade in studio.  Judge Alex, that dude from TV, in studio.  James Cromwell in studio.  Plus Sharknado. 
[00:04:00]  Ant had another party first.  We've got to get to these female interns.  You know, we've got two girl interns this semester, and they're just a distraction.  I mean, Opie and Anthony are treating them like they've never treated any interns before.  Favoritism is an understatement.  Opie and Anthony were talking, and Jim, of course, were talking about TV this week  and realized that there was a bit of an age gap between the interns and them.  Listen, as they discover all of the television shows that our interns Jackie and Sidney have never even heard of. 
[00:04:30]  Number eight.  Eight.  Eight.  Eight.  Eight.  Eight.  Number eight.  Our interns don't know any of these shows.  No, no, no.  The Facts of Life?  No, not even that.  Let's get the girls in and ask them.  They wouldn't even know that.  Facts of Life was 87.  You take the good, you take the bad.  Hold on, hold on.  Let's do this real fast.  I'll list the shows, and we'll see if they know them. 
[00:05:00]  Mashed, they'll know.  Because Mashed is on everyone.  Facts of Life, we've got to go with.  Get the two lovely ladies in.  Hold on, we're not ready for them.  They're outside the door.  Oh, yeah?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  One second.  Oh, look how troubled.  I'm not used to that.  Wait, what?  They threw us out.  It's over.  I've got Facts of Life, Wonder Years.  Happy Days?  Happy Days.  Oh, God, yeah.  Different strokes.  Different strokes.  All right, hold on, hold on.  Try Mashed or do you think that's on too much?  Mashed is kind of in the vernacular. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  That's right.  Just even if you've never seen it.  I'm more going for some of these comedy things.  Little House on the Prairie.  Wait, what was the one that Iraq said?  Different strokes.  Oh, different strokes.  Yeah.  Family Ties?  Yeah, Family Ties is good.  Family Ties is good.  All right, hold on.  Do we have a pen that works around here?  Why do these pens break?  What's happening?  Oh, no chance.  Growing Pains.  Good times.  Wait.  Punky Brewster.  Hold on, we got too many.  Why don't you just ask them?  I got facts.  All right, we're just trying to get a little list. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  All right, we'll start with these.  All right.  Bring them in.  All right, bring them on in.  Take a seat right here, girls.  Hi, girls.  Don't be alarmed that we said don't come in right away.  Yeah.  It has nothing to do with you.  You know, you're always welcome here in the Open Anthony broadcast.  Of course you are.  We're trying to prepare.  We were ill-prepared for you.  We don't like being ill-prepared before you get in here.  We were talking about television, of course.  And I guess Fred Savage.  Wait, let's start with this.  Yes.  What year were you guys born? 
[00:06:30]  94.  I'm filling up.  92.  92 and 94.  Okay.  All right, because Fred Savage is 37 today.  Do you know who he is before we said it on the air?  I've heard the name, but I can't put a show to him.  You know Ben Savage?  Yeah.  Boy Meets World?  Yeah.  Yeah, of course.  Boy Meets World.  What about The Wonder Years?  Yes.  Into the mic.  Yes.  Yeah, I've seen reruns.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  What's a rerun?  Okay. 
[00:07:00]  Who was rerun?  Yeah, who was rerun?  Do you know a character named Rerun?  No.  It's like the Jeff Goldblum movie game where we just take the word and keep going.  Oh, Jeff Goldblum.  You guys don't know who Rerun is?  Rerun.  Rerun from...  Did you ever see What's Happening?  No, I never saw it.  So-called What's Happening.  With Raj and Dee?  No.  Oh, man.  How about Good Times?  I never even saw those shows.  Good Times?  Do you know what Good Times is?  I've seen Cheers a bunch of times.  But what was Good Times about?  Do you even know?  No. 
[00:07:30]  I didn't watch it.  Good Times.  Good Times.  You got the song, Iraq?  Oh, my God.  Good Times.  Can you hear it?  You ever hear this?  Good Times.  Good Times.  You made a free.  Good Times.  And it's it.  Just laughing.  No?  No?  Huh?  What?  Could you hear it?  It's like a song from Hercules.  It's like a song from Hercules.  You know, Good Times was on the other day.  I was watching it.  Yeah.  And it was an episode where Junior, Junior JJ, was supposed to go to debutante ball with 
[00:08:00]  this fancy uppity woman.  And the parents at the last minute said, no, you can't take her because, you know, he's  not the right kind of guy.  And then they came over to Evan's house to go get the daughter back and bring her back.  And James is there and it was right on TV back then.  And he goes, he goes, oh, yeah, sorry, our boy's not too good.  Not good enough for your daughter. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, Florida.  What?  You didn't hear?  There's niggers living here.  Like right there on TV.  Wow.  They used to say niggers on TV.  The show premiered 20 years before Jackie was born.  Oh.  That may be why some of the mystery here may be why that's where the 20 years before  you were even born.  How great was it when he came in?  I would love to get him back in fucking John Amos.  He was awesome.  He's an awesome.  He was a great guest.  So if you think about it, right, 20 years, go back 20 years before that. 
[00:09:00]  If you use the same formula with me, it would be like somebody telling me they watched  bombing of Pearl Harbor.  What about Happy Days?  You guys watch Happy Days?  Happy Days.  Yeah, that's too big.  How about MASH?  Yeah.  Oh, it's my dad's favorite show.  Oh, your dad's favorite show.  Your dad's favorite show.  I've heard of it.  How old is your dad?  51.  How old is your dad?  He was born in 52. 
[00:09:30]  I don't know how old he is.  So he's born in 52.  51, I guess.  Yeah, something like that.  What about Family Ties?  No.  I used to watch Honeymooners.  Wow.  But that's like way older.  But yeah, the Honeymooners is weird.  That's every generation knows that.  That's always on TV.  Nobody does another Honeymooners.  Right.  Different strokes.  Wait, wait.  You said, what was the show you said?  No to Family Ties.  No to Family Ties?  No.  Family Matters.  Alex P. Keaton?  Family Matters.  Family Matters.  No Alex P. Keaton. 
[00:10:00]  A little Urkel, though.  A little Urkel.  She knows.  She remembers a little Urkel.  Wow.  What about the Tony Danza extravaganza?  Taxi.  Taxi.  Do you remember Taxi?  No.  Do you know what it's about?  I'm guessing a taxi.  Yeah.  You ever saw one episode?  It's a talking taxi.  That's a great show.  I think it might be the funniest sitcom ever.  It's hilarious.  After the Honeymooners.  It was a movie.  Taxi Driver.  Well, it was a movie.  No, she was thinking. 
[00:10:30]  The one with Queen Latifah and Jimmy Fallon.  Oh, my God.  I don't think she was thinking of Taxi Driver.  When you say taxi, we're kind of happy that you know Taxi Driver, but no, it's Taxi.  Taxi.  Jimmy Fallon.  Oh, my God.  That movie did well for those two, huh?  Sam?  I didn't see it.  I just know that it's a movie.  Nobody.  Nobody saw it.  Adam 12?  No.  Is he?  What?  Nope.  Chips?  Nope.  Baywatch?  The Rookies? 
[00:11:00]  No.  Columbo?  What?  No.  Macmillan and Wife?  Jesus.  I've heard of that.  Rosser's my dollar man.  Jesus.  Wouldn't it be funny if they were both big Rockford Files fans, though?  Macmillan and Wife's last episode was in 1977.  Wow.  And a few years later, it was Macmillan's last episode.  By the way, I heard the brutal break we did on that show. 
[00:11:30]  Did you?  Dude, we did a brutal fucking break on Macmillan and Wife.  Yes, Macmillan and Beard.  Yeah, broth again, Macmillan.  See the guy there?  Yeah.  That's Rock Hudson.  He was a big actor back in the 60s and whatnot.  And a sex symbol, believe it or not.  Stuff like that.  Yeah, yeah, with that big 70s porno mustache.  And lo and behold, who knew?  Gay.  No.  Totally gay. 
[00:12:00]  Died in 1985 of, I believe, the AIDS.  He was the first major guy to die of AIDS.  Yeah.  And people couldn't believe Rock Hudson was gay.  Rock Hudson is responsible for a lot of awareness about AIDS because once he died, people are like,  oh my God, this is a real thing.  Yeah, yeah.  They were like freaking out.  He was a sex symbol for women.  And he was a sex symbol and then he disappeared for a while and then he came out and was like,  he was in the public eye that time and they showed him on camera and it was like, oh my God, 
[00:12:30]  what's wrong with Rock Hudson?  Right.  Oh my God.  Did he talk about it?  I don't remember.  No.  He just died from the AIDS.  So he did a show called Macmillan and Life and years later we just...  Remember the AIDS jokes?  No?  He died from a can of bad meat.  Bad meat in a can?  Bad meat in a can?  Yeah.  A can full of bad meat.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You never heard that one?  No.  Yeah.  They're going to bury him upside down.  What was that one? 
[00:13:00]  We were gay guys.  You'd bury him.  His friends could...  His friends could do something.  I don't know.  I don't remember.  I don't know either.  That's a better one.  I forgot the one.  Some kind of joke.  But that was Macmillan and Life.  Macmillan and Life was part of the ABC mystery movie, which was like a rotating show that  they'd have.  It was an ABC mystery movie and then like one week it would be Macmillan and Life.  The next week, Columbo.  The next week, McCloud.  Was this also back in the 70s?  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  You actually lost me and Opie on this one too.  I was a little kid. 
[00:13:30]  You could have said television didn't exist in the 70s and it wouldn't have been just as  unbelievable.  What about Seinfeld?  Oh, yeah.  But in reruns, obviously.  I never got into Seinfeld.  What?  I loved that.  So wait, McCloud, what was that one about?  McCloud.  McCloud, yeah.  McCloud was kind of a cowboy guy, lawman, you know, kind of a sheriff or something, who  came to the big city to...  What?  You don't know McCloud?  To be a cop.  This is off the air, completely. 
[00:14:00]  The cop in the big city.  In 1977.  All right.  Off the air.  You can find the DVDs.  I know what show...  Why would you?  Why would you?  I know what show you both probably liked a lot.  Cannon.  Cannon.  That's always popular with young women.  Cannon.  No?  Cannon.  Not so much for Cannon.  A Quinn Martin production.  How about Quincy?  He was this big, fat detective.  Quincy?  There it is.  Cannon.  I got a brother named after Quinn Martin.  Yeah.  Quinn Martin was so famous. 
[00:14:30]  This one went off the air in 76.  Yeah, it's going back now.  It's going back.  How about...  Do you know Quincy?  Quincy.  No, I didn't know Quincy before I worked for this show.  Do you know The Odd Couple with Jack Klugman?  I've heard of The Odd Couple.  I've never seen it.  Wow.  Sydney?  Really weird.  You ever heard of it?  I don't think so, at least.  You ever heard of The Odd Couple?  I don't think so.  Pull it up.  I don't think so.  Pull it up.  I don't think so.  Oh, boy.  Not the movie.  The TV show.  The TV show. 
[00:15:00]  You have to listen to the...  Can you guys hear in there?  Oh, yeah.  Why wouldn't they know The Odd Couple that went off the air in 1975?  Oh, we're back another year.  There's reruns, though.  I watch shows...  That's true.  Nobody reruns The Odd Couple.  Yes, they do.  Mary Tyler Moore?  Mary Tyler Moore's show?  I used to like Mary Tyler Moore.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  Okay, that's about the same ballpark as The Odd Couple.  I know this song. 
[00:15:30]  What channel is The Odd Couple on?  Do you know this song?  The channel wasn't on?  Is it on?  Is it?  You're saying it's rerun now?  I don't know, but it was Nick at Night.  Or Nickelodeon or whatever that channel.  I haven't seen it recently.  Nick at Night doesn't even do that anymore.  It's somewhere.  Nick at Night does Friends now.  Yeah, Nick at Night does Stay by the Bell and Friends.  Yeah.  It's all on TV land buried.  TV land and Me.  Me TV plays it, too.  TV land.  They probably have all of them.  Yeah.  They do.  Well, you can get everything on DVD now, too.  You ever hear Mr. Ed?  I've heard of it.  Mr. Ed was a talking horse.  Yeah. 
[00:16:00]  Hold on.  I got an idea, though.  We should give them a little assignment that they have to watch one of these shows and  come back with a report.  With a report?  A book report on a TV show?  They'll probably have a weird fucking take on it.  Right.  What show, though?  That's great homework.  What show?  We've got to pick one.  Keep Throat.  Something they can obviously get.  What show?  Could it be something as ridiculous as McCloud?  Or do we go with...  I really like the movie Mystery.  McCloud.  Or Columbo.  McMillan and Wife.  We all know that.  McMillan and Wife.  You can find just one episode that they have to watch. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, yeah.  Do you get Netflix?  Should it be Quincy, maybe?  Because we talk about Quincy a lot on the show.  But Quincy, they're going to...  I guarantee you, I challenge you to only watch one episode of Quincy.  Oh, wow.  You're not going to be able to turn it off.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's give him a homework assignment for tomorrow.  You're going to find him sexy and intriguing?  What show should it be?  What show do you think?  Sexy.  The Worst of the Week Countdown. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, dude.  It's the Worst of the Week Countdown with me, Sam Roberts.  You can hear me on O&A every morning and hosting after Opie and Anthony live.  And my show, the Sam Roberts show, is Sunday at 4 p.m. Eastern.  Colin Quinn is my guest.  But all that aside, this is the Worst of the Week Countdown.  Counting down the great things that happened on the Opie and Anthony show this week.  Charlie Day was in studio.  David Spade was in studio.  Judge Alex was in studio.  Ant had another party.  We'll get to all that later.  We just heard the girl interns, Jackie and Sydney, from this Opie and Anthony show, talking 
[00:17:30]  about the TV shows that they'd never heard of.  They were born in the mid-90s.  They have no sort of point of reference for any of this stuff.  Opie, Anthony, Jim, and myself, I guess, assigned them to go home and watch an episode of the  show Quincy.  The fact that most of our audience now knows what the show Quincy even is really disappoints  me.  But they got to see Quincy for the very first time, for whatever reason, it's streaming  on Netflix.  So they watched it that way and came back with book reports. 
[00:18:00]  Here is the full report of Quincy, as told by two girls in their early 20s, only on the  Worst of the Week Countdown.  So you guys watched Quincy, and you had to write a book report.  Yeah, a typical book report.  It's little pieces of notebook paper.  It's on a loose sleeve with proper headings.  It's like the fucking note that was left at JonBenet's murder scene. 
[00:18:30]  And there's a third book report here.  Yeah, what is this about?  I mean a third.  We have two interns.  I made it clear.  Wow, we have two in it, right?  Yeah.  It's incorrect.  What?  There's a boy intern.  Oh, there is?  Oh, yes.  What's his name again?  Let me check the paper.  Trayvon?  He didn't write his name on his assignments.  What is it?  Jerry.  Five points off.  It's Jerry?  It's Jerry, I guess.  Yeah, it was made clear to him that he, in no way, shape, or form, had any book report 
[00:19:00]  assignment to do.  He was to go home and just...  We never said like, hey, you do it too.  No, sit home with your thumb up your ass.  You got nothing to do tonight.  What made him think he should like, try to get involved?  I guess go-to-itiveness?  I don't know.  Well, we like that, don't we?  I like that.  Yeah.  Yeah, we like that.  Showing some gumption.  Showing some, I'm not getting attention.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's desperate to be noticed. 
[00:19:30]  Kenny, when he handed it to me, he made the mistake of doing it in front of Kenny, and  Kenny goes, did you sign it, needy?  Kenny rules.  Yeah, so I have book reports turned in by Sidney, Jackie, and Jerry.  Jerry.  Jerry.  Very good.  Yeah.  Okay.  Where is Jerry?  He's getting Slurpees.  Instead of air time, he has to get free Slurpees for everybody. 
[00:20:00]  Slurpee day.  How great is that?  So, ladies, you watched it, and had to write a little book report on it. Overall, what'd  you think?  How great?  It wasn't bad, it was just a little slow.  A little slow?  A little 1970s, yeah.  Ah, yeah, a little 1970s-ish.  A little slow?  What are you talking about?  I read their book reports, and they both had the same observation of something that they 
[00:20:30]  did at the beginning of the episode that makes no sense and never happens anymore.  Oh, no.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  They did, like, instead of a recap, they did, like, a trailer instead.  But what's going on?  So, I was watching it, I was like, okay, so this is what happened in the last episode,  and nothing got solved. And as the episode went on, you realize that this is what you  already saw.  They were showing what you were going to see.  Yeah.  Oh, right.  They used to do that, right?  They did, yeah.  Oh, I forgot about that. 
[00:21:00]  Why would they do that?  I didn't know if, like, at the end, they were going to show and, like, do a recap.  Yeah, but what they just showed you, I don't, I didn't know what was going on.  Yeah, they show, like, a prequel, a preview of, yeah, it's really like a movie trailer  of what you're about to watch.  A lot, though.  Yeah, they show a lot of that.  Like, they show you a lot.  It gives you a waste.  You're like, oh, do I need to watch the episode?  Why would they do that?  How lame.  So, how should we handle this?  What other basic observations about the show?  The music was great.  Yeah, there's a lot of music. 
[00:21:30]  A lot of music.  I mean, it's way more suspenseful.  This is the opening theme.  They can't.  Yeah, the opening theme where they're showing him, because he's a coroner, but he's also  a guy.  Yeah.  You know, so they show him doing his coroner work, but then he'll be out to dinner, on  a date.  Yeah.  And then there he is in the medical examiner's office, and then there he's on his boat.  He's a devil-may-care jack-of-all-trades.  He really is.  Did you find him a good leading man for the show? 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, I actually.  Yeah, you did?  Yeah.  I liked him.  You did?  Jack Klugman.  Do you think he was sexy?  I went all that far.  Jackie noticed something subtle that they did in the show.  Yeah.  In her book report, she writes, it was a tad dull and very predictable.  They showed their number one suspect in the scene right after the murder.  Literally, and they show him watching the news report of the murder.  So you're like, oh, I wonder who it could be now.  So it's not even a whodunit kind of a thing. 
[00:22:30]  You just know.  No, you just know.  They're like, oh, did they move the body?  And then they show the guy who moved the body.  They really were catering to Simpletons.  But it ended without knowing if he was killed or if he just died.  If he was murdered.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That made me really mad.  Were you going to read the book report?  I think we should have them read it.  Yeah, yeah.  Why don't you read it?  Yes, absolutely.  Did they show the part where his assistant Sam attempts to land a plane in San Francisco? 
[00:23:00]  All right.  Who should read it first, Sam?  What do you think?  Can we read Tyler's?  Let's start with Sidney's book report.  Oh, Sidney.  Yeah, you can do it.  Sidney.  Did you ever have to give oral presentations in school?  I was vice president of my senior class.  Yeah?  I had to do a speech.  So you had to do a speech.  Yeah.  Oh, so this should be easy.  No.  Did you get up to give a speech at graduation or something? 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  Oh, so was it one of these?  Was it one of these?  As we move along in our life and advance from this, we will remember the good times we had  here, but also take with us the knowledge that we, I hate a good graduation speech.  Yes.  As we end this portion of our lives, we begin anew.  This isn't the ending of something.  It's the beginning of our lives as an adult.  We came here as children, merely not knowing what, oh, God, I hate those. 
[00:24:00]  How many times did you say build or future?  Yes.  Mine was all about the song.  Like, we had the class song.  What was the class song?  It was some dumb Nickelback song.  Oh.  I don't know why they pissed.  Really?  It was such a piss.  If the girls need any beverages, Tyler is here with Slurpees for everybody.  I have the cherry one, and I don't care.  I'm taking it.  I'm going to scoop out one taste.  Which one you got? 
[00:24:30]  It's like strawberry lemonade or something.  Oh, that sounds good.  It is good.  When do these Dr. Pepper Slurpees get invented?  It's blowing my mind.  Of course it does.  Can I scoop out one taste of yours?  Absolutely.  I wish you were drinking a Dr. Kevorkian Slurpee.  Dr. Kevorkian Slurpee.  He's hooked up in the woods in the back of a fucking hatchback, laying there on a pillow. 
[00:25:00]  Were you bummed that you had to spend time watching Quincy?  I had to get a little motivation.  Oh, yeah?  Get a little motivation?  Because I tried to start with the first episode, and then I was like, oh, I'm just going to watch  the one thing it's on.  No, good.  That should have been the 4th of July assignment.  12 Quincy episodes in eight days.  God damn.  No camping for you.  That would have been very mean.  Let's do their book reports, because we're going to run into David Spade time. 
[00:25:30]  He's coming in in about a half hour.  Okay.  Sydney.  Sydney.  Sydney.  You gave a speech once.  Just read it?  Yeah, but what's the meaning of that?  Yeah, and we'll question you as you read it, maybe.  Well, I start off with, like, an introduction.  Okay.  Just read it from the top.  Great.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The show started with what I had originally thought was a recap, but later realized it  was actually a sneak preview.  You said that.  I know.  You told me it was a good thing.  Oh, my God.  Jesus. 
[00:26:00]  Let's see.  I said, as with any televised program, the theme song was a treat, but mostly because it  formed an idea on who Quincy was without even having to watch the whole episode.  Ah, yeah, see, that's what I was saying, you know, he's the working guy, but then he's  just regular.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Let's see.  I'll go into the summary of the show.  We'll move on.  Okay.  Monaghan called Quincy in the middle of the night to go to an apartment because he knew  he was the right guy for the case. 
[00:26:30]  A priest had died in the home of a prostitute, and it was now Quincy's job to find out how.  Wow.  The priest was Father Martin Terrell, a man known by the news to be an activist and a  rebel.  Oh.  Father Martin had a heart condition and had died from a heart attack.  Back in the lab, the cause of death was confirmed, but the lividity on Father Martin's body suggested  that although the cause was no question, the location was up for debate.  Lividity.  It was not murder.  So Sam, so he had to check if he had been having sex with the hooker, so somebody walked 
[00:27:00]  in and they caught Quincy with the dead priest's penis in his mouth.  Oh, God.  What are you doing?  I'm checking in for residue, Sam.  Vaginal residue.  It makes my mouth numb.  It's a unique flavor.  It gives me bleach breath.  Was it like that?  That didn't happen.  I apologize.  They just moved on real quick. 
[00:27:30]  They were like, nope, we can't prove if they had sex or not.  And then that was a different challenge.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, that was back.  They couldn't talk about sex.  Yeah, that's a little too controversial.  A little wild.  Right.  You got to wash over that stuff.  But Quincy was arguing that they did have sex.  I found a cunt hair in his teeth, Detective Monaghan.  Easy, Quincy.  You can't prove it.  Detective Monaghan.  So what finally happened?  It was his excellence.  Well done.  I like this.  It's like you're watching it, right?  Yeah.  I don't know where it was. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, no.  The bullet.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What is it?  Father Terrell had funded an orphanage and a halfway house.  I was also a heavy activist against a dude who wore a very large medallion and ran a porno  magazine.  Oh.  I can't remember his name.  Al Goldstein?  It was a very stereotypical kind of, yeah.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Big medallion porno magazine.  Monaghan went to the halfway house.  I met with the priest attorney that was helping him fight against the porno guy to try and 
[00:28:30]  bring down, like, his whole empire thing.  And then he found out that just before Father Martin died, he was in a meeting with the porno  guy discussing a future article that could ruin the priest.  The priest.  Right.  Right.  Oh, boy.  Discussing, like, an affair or something with his lawyer.  Right.  So now he's, you know, he could get screwed on this one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He could go down.  So now what happened?  And then, obviously, the conversation got rather heated.  Ooh.  And the porno guy claimed that Father Martin left with much aggravation. 
[00:29:00]  In the lab, Quincy finds that a reddish colored fiber was found in Father Martin's throat  as part of his last breath.  A reddish colored fiber.  Uh-oh.  Ah-ha!  That would explain why she was cranky.  Oh, God.  Yeah, we got it.  Period.  A reddish fiber.  Yeah, find a reddish fiber.  The moth or pupa.  Yeah.  Okay.  Keep going?  Sure. 
[00:29:30]  Please.  They go back to the office of the porno guy to gather a sample of his carpet, but it  wasn't a match.  Ooh.  Setting them back at square one once again.  About the drapes.  And saying where Father Martin died and clearing a dead...  Oh.  Uh-oh.  Whatever.  No, no, wait.  Cindy, what happened?  Yeah, man.  Please.  Oh, setting them back in square one and saying where Father Martin died.  Okay.  Gotcha.  Monahan went back to talk to Father Martin's attorney one last time, and finally everything 
[00:30:00]  came together.  Ah.  Oh, good.  Yes.  Everything or everyone.  They're all standing there just looking at Father Martin, cranking.  And no one knew why.  Four men just jerking off, looking at the feet of a dead priest.  That's a hell of an episode.  I don't know what we're doing, but it feels right, doesn't it?  It turned out that the priest's attorney was very close to the man who was representing 
[00:30:30]  the porno guy.  During the argument between Father Martin and the porno guy, Father Martin had a heart  attack and collapse.  In a panic, the guy who ran the porno magazine called his attorney, who then put the priest  in his trunk, which had a red carpeted interview, and was also the location of Father Martin's  second heart attack.  Oh, man.  So they felt that would be...  Wait, he felt that would be a better idea than to call the ambulance.  Right.  Would be to put the priest in the trunk.  What the fuck?  That's in a spare tire?  Makes no sense. 
[00:31:00]  No.  The attorney was charged with negligent homicide, and I think other things that I remember.  Negligent.  Overall, this episode had a lot of twists and turns that didn't really matter at all, and  a whole lot of cheesy one-liners.  Oh, you don't remember any of the one-liners?  I didn't bring my notebook.  I thought I ran down my notebook.  Oh, man.  I'm fired.  I'm sorry.  I want to know what the one-liners were.  Yeah.  One was, now he's reading on my parade, or something like that.  Oh, that is a good one. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, good one.  Shit.  Love to hear those.  He died with a cause, like Father Terrell, or something like that.  Right.  Oh, okay.  Wow.  Okay.  Very concise.  Absolutely.  That was great.  Usually, when they do book reports, they get bombarded with insults, things like that.  No, that was terrific.  The gal's getting a pause break.  Yeah, that was great.  But she got a pause.  I love story time.  That was more of a very concise report of that.  Not much of your basic opinion on the characters. 
[00:32:00]  I thought we just had to do, like, a summary.  Well, that's okay.  That's exactly what we wanted.  That's what we asked for.  So, I painted the picture of the episode, and then Jackie has all the opinions.  We just did a scene.  There you go.  We did a scene.  Exactly.  Oh, that was very smart.  That is.  That is.  That is.  That is.  That is.  That is.  That is.  That is.  That is.  That is redundant in the time.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Yes.  It's so sexy the gals got together and watched Quincy.  What's sexier than that?  Two gals sharing some wine and watching Quincy.  Watching Quincy.  Things happen. 
[00:32:30]  They fall asleep.  Exactly.  It's Jackie's turn.  All right, Jackie, if you would.  Yeah.  And don't skip anything if it's the same stuff Sidney said.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't think it's anything.  This show, this show creates redundancy.  No.  So, I thought it started kind of slow, but the plot was really interesting with the  priest and a prostitute.  How interesting is that?  Sure.  It was weird to see the clips of the episode before it started, but I don't know the last  time I saw that. 
[00:33:00]  So, there were a lot of suspenseful moments with insane camera angles and constant scene  setting music.  Like, what was an insane camera angle?  Like, they'd zoom up from up his face or in it to get, like, the dun-dun-dun.  Oh, right, right.  I know, exactly.  Oh, it's constant.  It was awesome.  Crazy.  They'd start, like, having a giant white thing.  You're like, oh, no, they're like, it's like a polar ice cap and there's just a piece  of Quincy's dandruff on his tie.  Exactly.  That's a close-up.  And they pull back. 
[00:33:30]  I said it was, like, a 1970 version of CSI without all the fancy stuff.  Oh, very good.  Very good.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a great observation, though.  So schmancy.  I said it was a little predictable because they showed their number one suspect in the  scene right after the murder watching the news of the murder.  It was just straight-forward conversation and I was super pissed that they ended the  show on a cliffhanger.  Because they never said who, what happened. 
[00:34:00]  They never said.  I mean, I know, I just want to be straight-forward told.  I don't want to think for myself.  Yeah, they should have said it was murder.  Or, you know, yeah.  Was that it?  No, I said I thought it was funny how giant the remotes were back then.  Oh, that's a good observation.  Very good.  It was a huge block.  And also, when they showed the porno guy and his riches, he had the three small square  TVs next to each other nowadays.  Oh, wow.  But I didn't say that.  It was very good. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah, that is pretty good.  Yeah, it would have happened.  Yeah.  I said, all in all, it wasn't a bad show, but I wouldn't choose to watch it again.  You wouldn't watch it again.  And I'm ready for the next show to watch.  Yeah.  Wow.  It's Quincy.  All right.  You know what?  Very, very concise.  I know.  No.  Yeah, Sharknado.  Is that on there?  Because that was a little...  No, no, no.  No applause, though?  Well, yeah.  Of course.  Of course applause.  We were busy with our Slurpees, Sam.  I really didn't know how well these book reports were going to go. 
[00:35:00]  I mean, should we get the other intern in to do his?  I guess.  I think we should.  I mean, Jerry wrote it.  We should hear him out.  He's a good guy.  Yeah, I guess.  Does anybody want my thing?  I only wanted a couple of tapes of it.  I don't know.  Quincy's job.  He was a coroner, but he was also, like, a detective.  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah.  I don't get it.  No.  He was just a coroner who took matters into it.  Because what happened was somebody gave him a members-only jacket, and he realized this  calls for action.  But he never had any normal murder?  Just no.  Oh, he just passed away in his sleep.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:35:30]  The weird thing, people back then didn't really know what people's jobs were, so they assumed  the coroner went out and investigated the cases, too.  Do you know how inappropriate it would be if Quincy had to testify in court, and they  started asking him a question about his involvement in an investigation?  Right.  They'd be like, you know, so wait, wait, wait.  Wait.  Let me get this straight.  You went to the crime scene on your own accord, and started, you know, going through people's 
[00:36:00]  belongings, and stuff, like, especially five seasons' worth of investigation.  And you spoke to the suspect?  Yeah, yeah.  You spoke to the...  And accused him of a murder?  Fucking...  Murder.  Grounds for immediate dismissal.  Yeah.  Everybody that's accused of murder just gets off the hook, because Quincy fucks up the  case.  Yeah, exactly.  He's just the case fucker-upper.  Yeah, I want to see, like, after match, I want to see...  After Quincy.  After Quincy.  All of the additional crimes that were committed because of his courtroom blunders. 
[00:36:30]  I felt I needed to investigate.  Yeah.  There was a carpet fiber, just like the one in your car.  Dismissed.  Yeah.  Next case, Quincy.  Yes.  We now call to the stand, uh, medical examiner Quincy.  I had to drive...  I had to drive the suspect to the store that day.  We talked about the case.  Dismissed.  Yeah.  This is always something terrible.  He was following me, and he went off a cliff.  Ha ha.  Dismissed.  Ha ha.

Yes, sir, Worst of the Week Countdown continues with me, Sam Roberts.  You can hear me on the Opie and Anthony Show every morning and after Opie and Anthony Live.  Still to come on this Worst of the Week Countdown as we count down the great moments that happened on the Opie and Anthony Show this week.  Anthony's going to be talking about his party from last weekend. 
[00:42:00]  Sharknado talk.  You know Sharknado.  It's a big week for pop culture.  Charlie Day's in studio.  David Spade's in studio.  Right now, I want to play a big guest we had in studio this week.  James Cromwell.  Y'all know him from something.  Whether it's L.A. Confidential or Babe or American Horror Story or whatever it is.  He's been in tons of different things.  He's a great actor.  And he was on the show.  He's a vegan.  He's a liberal.  And he's fantastic. 
[00:42:30]  James Cromwell was on the Opie and Anthony Show.  This is how it all went down.  The Pop Pop.  Six.  Number six.  Oh, yes.  James Cromwell in studio.  We are actually on.  Hello, sir.  We're having a crazy day.  Are you?  A very busy day.  Great.  You look great.  Look at you.  Thanks.  Old.  No!  Not at all.  Not at all.  You're aging well, sir. 
[00:43:00]  Fabulous.  Like a fine wine.  You're aging quite well, sir.  Thanks.  You look so little.  You look fine, sir.  You're doing pretty good.  Well, you play in the movie.  I saw the movie.  It's still mine.  And you play a guy who's, what, like 87 years old?  Yeah.  Which is weird to start playing roles where you have to, like, tack that age onto it?  Like, oof.  No.  The man I played built his own house.  Not only did he build the house, he felled the logs, milled them himself.  No help.  Poured the foundation, framed it, roofed it, plumbed it. 
[00:43:30]  I was in the house.  So, if that's an 87-year-old man, I don't have to play.  I don't have to put it.  No makeup.  I couldn't do it physically, so I thought, well, it's fine.  It doesn't matter how I look.  Wait, he did all that at 87?  At 87.  Wow.  He was 90 when he finished.  Wow.  And when did he die?  He died, actually, directly after we did the film, but he lived in the house for a couple  of years with his wife, which is why he built the house.  Sure, sure.  She had the beginnings of Alzheimer's, and, you know, the choice was either she goes into 
[00:44:00]  an institution against her will, very unhappily, and their entire life is just blown to pieces,  or he builds this house to give her as easy a transition into whatever that dark night  of dementia is.  Right.  But at least she got to be in a place that she loved and with somebody who took care of  her.  So it was very, very dear.  And he ran afoul of the building commission in the province because he did not have architectural 
[00:44:30]  plans.  He didn't get his lumber stamped.  He didn't have the permits to do it.  It was enraging, by the way, watching this and watching him deal in Canada.  Watching him deal with this bureaucracy.  It's a real story.  Yeah, yeah, sure.  It happened in New Brunswick.  We didn't shoot it in New Brunswick, except for the last part of the film.  And they would have bulldozed the house, except it got in the local paper.  Then the provincial paper picked it up.  Then it got to the national paper, and the premier of Canada saw it, and he said, you're  going to bulldoze a house built by a 90-year-old man for his wife who has dementia. 
[00:45:00]  Get out of your bloody minds.  Oh, and you put it like that.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, golly gee.  You're stupid.  You're right.  But it shows you how inhuman the organizations are.  Like, watching you deal with the...  He goes in to, like, get a permit.  And you realize, this is a guy in his 80s who's just lived life on this land, and I have to  start dealing with this shit bureaucracy.  Yeah.  It made my stomach tight watching it. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, you know, the regulations...  One of the reasons I like the film, it doesn't...  It's not black and white.  The guy is not wrong.  They put those regulations in place because there are unscrupulous builders who cut corners  and build substandard houses, which they sell to unsuspecting people.  That's why you have regulations.  But the problem with authority, as we now know in this country, is that once authority  has some power, they want more power.  And then they don't look at individual cases, and they don't care whether you're capable.  They don't care whether it's a unique circumstance. 
[00:46:00]  They just want to impose the rule because they can't see anything past the rule.  Right.  And you wind up with Mr. Snowden, who I very much support.  Oh, you like him?  Yeah.  I do.  Very much support him.  I'm up in the air on him.  I kind of...  I like...  WikiLeaks.  I really like what they do, and a part of me is like, well, did they put people in danger  at all?  Or...  Like, I'm kind of in the middle, but I don't hate Snowden.  I kind of...  There's people that want him executed for treason.  Sure.  And then there are people that think he did a great thing.  Is he still in that airport?  Yeah, he's still in the airport. 
[00:46:30]  He's got to be getting sick of the food.  Well, look at Julian Assange.  And the embassy in London, he's been cooped up there for a year, right?  A year.  No, the thing that somebody said, one wonderful person said, the government is no longer afraid  of Snowden or Julian Assange or Bradley Manning.  The damage has already been done.  And as to putting people in danger, everything that they released is vetted by the Guardian  or the New York Times or the papers there.  And no lawyer in a newspaper is going to say, you can't print. 
[00:47:00]  Right.  So they take out all the things that would actually endanger national security, and they're telling  the American people the truth, which is what the Obama administration is afraid of.  Not those guys, but that somebody else in the government might say, oh, Snowden was right.  This sucks.  This is illegal.  This is unconstitutional.  This is unjust.  And I'm going to expose it.  That's the people that they want to frighten.  And misinform the American public so that we don't know what's happening until we wind 
[00:47:30]  up one day and we have turnkey totalitarianism and the deal is done.  Yeah, yeah.  And it can happen just like that.  They don't want a breach in the dam at this point.  Exactly.  So, you know, they look at these guys like, well, it will give people ideas, and if enough  people do it, it undermines their power.  We're not talking about the film now, but...  No, no, no.  It's okay.  Do you think...  Because Obama, again, he's another guy I'm up in the aisle.  Like, I kind of like him personally.  He's more liberal than I am, but I kind of like him. 
[00:48:00]  But a lot of people who support him are very disappointed because they feel like he wasn't  transparent like you said he would be and that he wasn't who he presented himself as.  Actually, every promise that he's made, he broke.  So, I don't know why people wouldn't be...  I mean, you just have to look at Guantanamo.  You know, I know he's facing a Congress that is not supporting him, but in terms of nobody,  none of these banks, none of those people went to jail for what they did, and we went  in the hole, and the person who got us in the war, for no reason at all, in fact, a lie, 
[00:48:30]  he lied to the President of the United States, the other one, Shrub, lied to the American people  in front of Congress, and today he's on the New York Times.  He's flanked by two guys getting their citizenship in uniform.  So, why is George Bush on the front page of the New York Times?  He has a very good publicist.  If I had that publicist, I would be on the front page.  Not only that, but people, very short memories in this country, very short memories. 
[00:49:00]  Something could happen, and then everyone's all outraged about it, and then after a little  while it goes by, it's like, hey, look, I'm back, can I, you know, we see it in New York  State alone with Wiener and Spitzer, it's like, and not that I think any of it is this  outrageous bad things that they did, but it's just the fact that it's like, well, Spitzer  Spitzer more so than Wiener, Spitzer, he broke the law.  He was going after people that were doing the same thing he was doing, going into, you  know, and getting prostitutes for money. 
[00:49:30]  So, but Anthony Wiener is just some guy that decided, hey, here's my Facebook and Twitter  and just say it, here's my dick.  What do they call those photographs that people take now of themselves?  Selfies.  Selfies.  A selfie.  He did the wrong selfie.  Oh, he certainly did.  Believe me, I understand those.  Every photo of me has my feet in it.  But yeah, Spitzer was kind of being self, like, he was a total hypocrite, like, because 
[00:50:00]  he was targeting people for what he was doing, but, but Wiener's just sending out pictures  of, like, who cares?  I know, he's going to come back, though, because he was quite a worthwhile congressman, right?  He'll come back, and, um...  They both will come back.  I don't think, I don't think Spitzer...  You don't think so?  People aren't as sympathetic to him, because...  I saw somebody on the street, when I came out of the subway, collecting signatures, you  know?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Because I guess he has to, he has to come up with enough signatures to make it on the 
[00:50:30]  ballot, right?  Yeah.  I think he will, anyway.  You know?  Probably.  It doesn't matter.  Back to the movie.  Yeah.  Yes, absolutely.  Absolutely.  How did this gentleman get the knowledge to do all the plumbing and milling and cement  work?  Oh, just living long enough to learn it?  We don't realize that in New York, although there are New Yorkers who do this, but in the rest  of the country, people, especially in the middle of the country, you know, they live  on a farm, you don't call a plumber from Topeka to come out to your little town, you learn 
[00:51:00]  how to fix the plumbing, you know what to do with, you know, you wire the barn up, you  roof your own house, you know how to frame it, you get a neighbor who, you know, has shingles,  you, you, so, uh, people are very, uh, self-reliant.  Uh, he's an ordinary man who does extraordinary things because he's principled, uh, he's determined,  uh, and, uh, there's no, really no side.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What was his background?  I like that.  I want to raise my hand. 
[00:51:30]  Yes, sir.  I didn't want to interrupt.  Um, what, what was his background?  He's a, he's a, you know, I think I, I thought about this the other day.  I, you know, I know he's not a farmer.  Right.  Uh, I think basically he was a landowner.  He owned 2000 acres and he probably in Canada milled logs and sold because he had his own  mill, uh, which he was very capable of running.  So I imagine he was, uh, what do they call it?  Lumber person, you know, lumber yard.  And without being, you know, not to that extent or anything, but are you yourself, uh, 
[00:52:00]  handy with the things like that around the house?  A friend of mine came to the screening last night who was actually a contractor.  And I asked him and I said, how are the, how did I handle the tools?  He said, no, the tools were okay, but you didn't frame the windows.  No, that house would not have stood.  Actually, some, the builder who built the house was, he was incredible.  He built one guy built that entire house.  Um, you know, it's like totally completed, but I, you know, while we were shooting the 
[00:52:30]  film, it went from nothing to a house.  I thought, I know I'm my hat.  So my father and I built a shed when we finished, my father was very punctilious, but because  of me, the whole thing, every angle, there wasn't, wasn't a 90 degree angle in the entire  thing, a big box, big square.  It was a, no, but it wasn't square.  No, not square.  I'm so dumb.  Somebody had stepped on it.  A little off.  Yeah.  Oh, that's great.  He said 90 degree angle and I'm thinking triangle.  I truly am a high school dropout. 
[00:53:00]  That's great.  God, am I a fool?  That's why you're in radio.  A triangle can have a 90 degree angle in it.  No, I know, but I'm good.  Yes, it can.  Oh, good.  Well, none of us know what we're talking about.  Surprised you put a roof on the house.  You, it's like amazing, I can't even look at your IMDB, there's too many amazing things  in it, like there's just too many impressive things in the resume, but they started, the  Rockford files in 74, but why is this 1955 daddy long legs?  What did you do in that? 
[00:53:30]  No, no, no, you know, IMDB, like WikiLeaks, once somebody, it gets on there, you ask them  over and over again, please take that out.  There's evidently some guy in 55 named James Cromwell before I was a member of the union.  And they seem to have forgotten what I, I'm glad, so I'm not Robert Cromwell or something.  And he did it and I can't get it off.  Oh, so you also weren't in an episode of Manimal?  No, I was not.  Remember Manimal?  And Super Train? 
[00:54:00]  Sometimes it's hard for me to remember what it was.  I would have remembered.  You didn't remember that one, I think.  Wouldn't it be funny if we had the wrong James Cromwell?  Were you all in the family?  No.  No.  I loved your angels in America.  It wasn't me.  Oh, shit.  Some people think that I'm in Patriot games.  Really?  Yeah, I think it's Jimmy Rebhorn or Donald's...  Pleasant?  No.  Sutherland?  Sutherland?  No.  I've forgotten his name and I did a play with him.  Duck? 
[00:54:30]  Donald Trump.  You know, it must be really...  I always think about Jimmy Rebhorn that, unfortunately, people say,  Oh, weren't you in, babe?  Oh, no.  No, no.  I said, well, you were in the late Confidential...  No, I'm sorry.  Well, you guys have your physical resemblance?  Yeah, yeah.  You know, I don't think so, but he was in the game.  If you remember the game, he was really...  He's a wonderful actor.  And it's really...  It must be like a knife in his back every time.  Oh, somebody else.  How many episodes of All in the Family were you actually in? 
[00:55:00]  Luckily, only three.  Only three?  Yeah.  Why do you say luckily only three?  I was hired because Carol O'Connor quit the show because he wanted his name above the title.  And Norman Lear said, what do I say to Gene Staple?  And she's as much a part of the show, you know, and that would be unfair to her.  So I was hired, my character was hired, to actually kill off Archie.  And when we were rehearsing the show where he was going to die, when Carol settled,  if I had stayed on that show, which was their plan, I would have always been known to all 
[00:55:30]  of you as Stretch Cunningham, sort of like Henry Winkler.  That's true.  And even Carol, who was a magnificent actor, because of Archie, when he tried to go back  on the stage, everybody just saw Archie Bunker.  They couldn't see the man anymore.  Yes.  Yes.  So I really owe my career to Carol for saying he's better off where he is, which is what  he said to me.  You're better off where you are.  Wow. 
[00:56:00]  Were you conscious of that then?  No.  So you would have just taken the gig.  Oh, I wanted the gig, man.  Right.  I wanted the gig.  It was a great gig.  Oh, man.  I mean, I had gone on to do other things, but that one, you know, I thought, wow, I really  got that guy.  And, you know, it was very popular.  And, you know, Cavies, you'd walk in New York and they'd roll down their windows, hey,  Stretch, how you doing?  Yeah, that's pretty cool.  That's really cool.  Yeah.  But it has a downside.  You know, success, the wrong kind, has a downside.  Yeah.  You pay for it dearly.  Wow.  You know, and most people would have thought you were in more episodes than that because 
[00:56:30]  the name was mentioned so many times.  Yes, the name was mentioned.  Well, there was one other one.  The name was mentioned a lot.  And then Carol, in order to make sure that I did not come back, buried, killed me, buried  me.  I turned out to be Jewish.  And he spoke at the funeral service.  That's right.  And I think he leaned out of it.  Not coming back.  That's it for you.  That's right.  He didn't know you were Jewish.  That's right.  The character was Jewish.  That's right.  That was a funny episode.  I didn't remember that.  Did he not like you?  No, no.  I was very fond of him and he of me. 
[00:57:00]  It's just that he knew what the cost was.  Wow.  He knew more than I did.  He was much, he was savvier, smarter.  Isn't it?  It's almost depressing to watch All in the Family now or such great, great, like socially  addressing comedy that addressed social issues in real language and in real ways.  Yeah, yeah.  And now it's just such a...  They barely touch it.  They barely touch it.  It's ridiculous.  And when they do, it's emasculated and sanitized.  Like they don't show you anything honest anymore.  Now, that's interesting.  Now, but Cable, I did a show, American Horror Story. 
[00:57:30]  What do you think about that?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I have not seen it.  Cable's different on the network.  That...  Cable's very much different.  Yes.  You can't do it on the network, but Cable is picking up and they're doing...  You don't even know how...  Jimmy should have added, it is finally getting better.  Oh, yeah, and on Cable is different.  But there was a long stretch there where it was ridiculous.  Yeah, they didn't learn from what was so successful and great.  They just started to water down.  No, the next echelon of Harvard graduate executives that come in who know nothing about television,  they have to make the same mistakes all over again.  All over again, yeah, yeah. 
[00:58:00]  They have to make the same crap back.  Yeah.  And it's not run by creative people anymore.  When you see where the viewers are going and they're going to places like FX and...  HBO.  A&E and HBO, things like that.  You wonder why the networks are still adhering to this weird morality.  It's almost like a moral thing.  Like, we don't want to go past a certain point with language or certain content because they  don't want to offend people.  But it's not just offending people. 
[00:58:30]  And offending people isn't that wrong in context, you know?  If you're really putting a message out there or doing something very well, what's the problem  if some people get offended?  There's a problem because your sponsor has a corporate position that should they offend  a segment of the society and that segment decide to boycott your product, your sponsor  is really pissed off.  That's what we saw Rod Serling did an interview and touched on that subject for a good 10 minutes. 
[00:59:00]  It was brilliant and you could play it right now and it's absolutely relevant.  What did he say in general?  It was that the sponsors are running the show and he came up with some storylines that he  had to change because, you know, you can't sell that soap if people are angry at what you're  putting out there.  But cable has sponsors too, though.  Like, you know, I think the people, the people who subscribe are the sponsors and now people 
[00:59:30]  want the best television.  They want to be informed.  They want to be, they want to be pushed.  They want the, the envelope expanded.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's corporate people that want it because they've bought, they want a particular audience.  They want women from 20 to 25 with a certain amount of income and who live in a certain  place to buy this particular product.  So the last thing they want to say is, you know, is somebody coming on.  And, you know, to have something that is, uh, uh, well, of course it wouldn't be chauvinist,  but on the other hand, it wouldn't be about women's liberation either. 
[01:00:00]  Right.  Right.  It wouldn't be about abortion or it wouldn't be about the glass ceiling or so.  Anything that might chase away that demo is, uh, yeah.  Right.  Not going to be on there.  Well, and, and it just, it really cuts down.  It's so good that there are outlets now for, uh, the artistic end of it instead of just  the, uh, financial end of it.  It's very good for us.  Yeah.  No chance.  It makes some wonderful programming.  It's great to be on.  I mean, I've done, I really like, uh, what happened with American Horror Story. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  Six Feet Under was a very, very special show and to have been part of that, um, I'm very  proud of it.  Would you, uh, go back to any series-driven, uh, television?  Well, I'm actually doing a show for ABC.  It's funny we were talking about.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, no, no.  Don't tell him.  No, ladies and gentlemen, Jesus, come on.  Thank you.  Burn the tape.  Burn the tape.  Sold out.  Oh, my.  I'm surprised you didn't run away when we brought that.  Is it a comedy or a drama?  It's a drama.  Okay.  All right.  Okay. 
[01:01:00]  At least have some.  And it's, uh, it's a series, it's called Betrayal, and it's been on, uh, Dutch television  for the past three years.  So it's their most successful show.  And, uh, the producer said, you know, it's a Lear story.  And since I'm very interested in Lear, uh, doing a production of Lear, any chance I get  to take even a contemporary version of it, uh, I wanted to do.  Um, and now I get all the attendant problems.  Of being on a network.  Right.  I don't have a script for the show.  We start shooting on the 17th because I know the writer had to submit it to ABC and it's 
[01:01:30]  going around from one executive office to another executive office, standards and practices,  standards and practices, you know, and all the things.  And then, and of course it's rushed because they don't want to put the money into extending  the shooting days to make a better product.  They want to as quickly as possible.  So you have fewer takes.  There's a lot of strain on everybody.  And, but it gets done and hopefully it'll be a, you know, we'll do our best.  Do you leave sometimes like going like, damn it. 
[01:02:00]  Do you get, I mean, it seems like it's an easy, not an easy gig, but it's like, it's  not roofing or something like that.  But do you leave just upset?  I've never done roofing professionally and I'm sure it's hard, but I want to tell you  to, to be on a, on a television series.  This is no walk in the parks, mostly for people who have the leads, the amount, the length  of the hours, the intensity of, you know, it's, it's not as easy as it looks to stand  in front of a camera and actually do something.  There's a, there's a lot of concentration, physical effort that goes into it. 
[01:02:30]  You do that for 12 hours, 14 hours, and you do it the next day for 14 hours.  It's sort of like writing the tour de France.  It's a, yeah, I, I obviously didn't need to make it sound like it was easy.  I meant like getting, getting angry at the things that you had brought up with the script  and, and that, well, that happens, you know, that even happens on, it happens the same  thing on features, uh, you know, no matter how much time you have.  And then it gets, if you throw money, you know, you're making a $250 million film.  They have time.  It takes forever to do half a page takes three days. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  And there are hundreds.  I did, uh, longest yard and the guy, the caterer said to me, guess how many people we  have for lunch?  425 people for lunch.  Whole, I mean, this is not, we're not talking about 125 million.  That's 400 people.  So 400 people putting their creative and try to make this thing.  That's, there's bound to be frustration.  There's about, you know, somebody's out.  Uh, it's not the, listen, I, my personal opinion is actors show up all the time. 
[01:03:30]  You don't see a bad performer.  You don't go to a movie and the guy, holy man, what the hell was he doing?  We always show up and we always show up on time, but there are so many pressures to get  this thing, right?  It's like a battleship.  It is amazing to watch, uh, cause I, the length of time it takes to do one, one take  of something just to get one scene.  It's, I've always been stunned at how long it takes.  Hours and hours and hours for one quick. 
[01:04:00]  That's it.  Well, when we recently filmed with Chris Rock.  Oh, well.  We filmed for 40 minutes, James, and we know we're going to be on screen for maybe, maybe  two seconds.  40 minutes.  40 minutes we sat here.  If we're lucky, we'll be on screen for two seconds.  We had no scripts either.  It was just like a real interview that's being incorporated.  It was a lot of fun, actually.  Chris is great.  Yeah.  But we're sitting here going 40 minutes and you know none of it is going to be used.  Listen, it's part of a montage.  We know we're part of a montage, right? 
[01:04:30]  How awful is it?  It was exciting, though.  When you tell people you're in a movie, and I've heard actors say that, and they get cut,  and then the company doesn't tell them if they're cut, and you show up with somebody.  Oh, and you're not in it.  I've had that happen.  Have you really?  Oh, yeah.  He edited a film called Pennies from Heaven, and I thought, they can't cut this scene.  I'm there.  I forced the bad guy to jump out the window and commit suicide.  I can't cut that scene.  No.  They cut that scene.  They cut the scene.  They figured out a workaround.  I figured out a way to get him.  I don't know.  Did I just tell your story? 
[01:05:00]  Yes.  Maybe you're the guy I heard it from.  Listen, any actor who sits in this scene has that story.  The Worst of the Week Countdown on the Opie and Anthony Channel.

Only on USA Network.  The Worst of the Week Countdown.  No!  Continues.  This countdown just doesn't stop.  It's the Worst of the Week Countdown with me, Sam Roberts, where we count down the great things that happened this week.  On the Opie and Anthony Show, David Spade's still to come.  Charlie Day is still to come. 
[01:09:30]  Sharknado is still to come.  You know, we've been talking about this Trayvon Martin, George Zimmerman case quite a bit here on the Opie and Anthony Show.  And this week we had Judge Alex, who a lot of you might know from his TV court show.  He came by the studio and gave his take on what was going on.  He's been giving his legalese, his legal expertise everywhere as far as this case goes.  And we wanted to hear it from the horses.  The public doesn't care about IBM and Microsoft being in some antitrust suit or something like that. 
[01:10:00]  What they care about is, like, I had a woman who her friend came to her and said,  you know, don't spend $2,000 on photography for your wedding.  I could do it for half of that.  I'll just say $1,000.  So she said, okay.  She paid her $1,000.  And then she's getting out of the limo, pulling her train of her dress behind her and looks up to see her friend,  snapping pictures of her with those little yellow disposable cameras you pull out of the dollar cameras from the bin. 
[01:10:30]  And she had a bag hanging from her arm with about 12 more of them.  And that's how she was going to photograph the wedding.  That was a $1,000 photographer there.  Oh, wow.  Sometimes, you know, you get what you pay for, though.  Yeah.  Well, you're getting screwed.  It's amazing the interest people have in the legal system, though.  Like, I guess it started with the people's court and then went to, who was after that?  Like, Judge Judy?  But people, or Joe Brown?  And people are fascinated.  I think it's what prevents people from hitting each other is the fact they can go to court. 
[01:11:00]  It's a way of doing it.  Well, I mean, that is why we have court.  So we resolve the disputes in some civilized manner.  Pounding each other.  As opposed to dueling.  Yeah.  Whenever we have these big cases, like, of course, the Zimmerman trial going on right now,  people seem to want to get involved.  You know, they want to watch the trial.  But they don't seem to want to get all the facts.  No.  I've seen, especially with the Casey Anthony trial, of course, and this trial, people have 
[01:11:30]  very strong opinions based a lot on emotion.  Not many facts of the case and education on the judicial system.  It's not limited to court system.  I mean, with social media, somebody says something, and everybody accepts it as true, and then  they repeat it, and then they amplify it.  And, you know, it's like a global game of telephone.  Uh-huh.  And it completely changes, and everybody, it's gospel, you know, all the way through.  There have been some things that were brought up that were just plain lies, rumor, things 
[01:12:00]  that were thought to be fact at the beginning of the investigation, and now, as it's evidence  in court being presented, it was found that that was completely false, yet people are still  repeating it, and you can't tell them different.  Right, right.  Well, you know, I think originally, George Zimmerman, when he called the police, said  that, when he was describing Trayvon, he said it's somewhere between 5'11", 6'2".  Right.  Well, forever, Trayvon was 6'2".  6'2", and then we find out he was 5'11".  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:12:30]  I mean, he nailed the height pretty well.  He actually did, yeah.  What's the one thing that you've noticed in social media, because I see on Twitter a  lot with this case, that people just plain have wrong?  The one that just keeps coming up, that you're like, oh my God, how many times?  I mean, everybody, depending on which camp you're in, you know, those, they're the extremists  on the George Zimmerman side that are like, you know, absolutely, he did nothing wrong.  You know, there's no way that he could have done anything that was improper in this case 
[01:13:00]  when they don't really know, nobody knows what happened at the time of the confrontation.  I mean, we have George's version, but obviously George has a reason to be biased on that.  And then you've got the other side, which is absolutely no self-defense.  I don't care how many times you beat it on a concrete.  It doesn't matter.  He approached him.  He got out of the car.  He should never have done that.  And he's a racist.  Right.  And then you have the ones in the middle who are really, you know, I have friends who  seesaw back and forth.  They hear this piece of evidence.  They hear that piece of evidence.  They're going back and forth. 
[01:13:30]  The smarter ones.  We're weighing it as it happens.  Well, they're not trying to justify a position, which is what the others are doing.  The others have made up their mind, and whatever evidence comes in, if it's good for them,  oh, that was great, credible evidence.  Right.  And if it wasn't good for them, oh, that guy was clearly lying.  So they're basically asses.  And they will twist.  Jimmy's still trying to get me to say I agree with you.  So I think that the racist part is the part that I think a lot of people have gotten wrong.  I mean, I don't know George Zimmerman. 
[01:14:00]  Maybe he is a raging racist.  But so far, the evidence seems to be, and even the detective got on the stand and said,  listen, when I found out that this guy was mentoring African-American children, I realized,  come on, this guy isn't a racist.  I mean, and he went in front of the county commission at one point about a cop's son who  beat up a black homeless man and berated the police department about it and then went  out and tried to fundraise for this black homeless person.  Those are not the typical things that racists do. 
[01:14:30]  Unless you're the most clever racist ever.  You're padding your reputation before you do this.  And I think that's the problem with the claim of racist.  It spans somebody who is a KKK to somebody whose neighborhood has been burglarized by just  a stream of African-American individuals.  And so therefore, the next time he sees an African-American individual, he must be racially  profiling.  Right.  And, you know, it's a very broad spectrum. 
[01:15:00]  It really is.  Yeah.  There's no volume knob on it.  It's one extreme to the other.  Now, don't get me wrong, I don't have any problem with the fact that race was injected  into this case at the outset.  I think to ignore the possibility when you have a white male who calls in about a black  male who wasn't doing anything, it's right to say, well, I wonder if this was racially  motivated.  Because we do live in a racist society and there is a lot of racism.  But when you don't find evidence of it, then it's time to say, okay, maybe I was wrong.  Move along. 
[01:15:30]  Some people will never say they were wrong when it comes to that claim.  And some people will never see racism even when it exists.  Why did the press, I mean, we all know why, but they go with, like, you know, he's Spanish  and he's white, but they just refuse to go with the other angle.  The white angle is just so much juicier, it seems, than the press.  By the way, what am I?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I've gotten this question a million times and I used to think that white was a race and  Hispanic was an ethnicity.  But I think somewhere along the line that changed and I didn't really get the memo on it because  people tell me, like, you're not white. 
[01:16:00]  And we have black Cubans and white Cubans.  I'm Cuban.  So I'm not really sure.  I guess it doesn't matter now.  Yeah, what is it?  What do you check in the little box when you have to check?  Well, you know, when they give me a choice for Hispanic, I check Hispanic.  Okay.  But when, you know, when you're, you typically, I'm thinking from my police days and my police  days, if you were describing somebody, it was, you didn't, if you were black, you were 
[01:16:30]  black.  If you were white, you were white.  And that was for identification purposes because if the other police officer needed to try to  find him, yeah, we're looking for a white male or we're looking for a black male.  You can be Hispanic and be noticeably Hispanic.  I don't think I fall into that category.  Some people confuse me for Middle Eastern or I don't know what, but I never really, a  little Jewish, I guess.  Well, you know, I do know the prayer of the bread and the prayer of the wine.  Oh, there you go.  I grew up Catholic, but I'm, I'm hedging my bets in case my parents are wrong. 
[01:17:00]  But anyway, so this is, this is a, a very high tension case.  This is not like Casey Anthony because in Casey Anthony, everybody was pretty much united  behind the fact that she killed her daughter.  Now, now that's an interesting case because, and I followed that one like I'm following  this one.  And as I watched it very closely, I did not see the prosecution present a case where she  could be convicted.  I just didn't. 
[01:17:30]  You would have fit right in on that jury.  I did.  Yeah, right.  I just didn't see it.  I don't, I don't know, I don't know what expectation the jury had.  That was a circumstantial evidence case.  This is a circumstantial evidence case, but that was a circumstantial evidence case, but  it was a powerful circumstantial evidence case.  I mean, you had a two year old girl, two or three, I don't remember now, three, I think  approaching her third birthday.  Three year old girl whose body is found in two bags in the woods with duct tape that was 
[01:18:00]  clearly positioned over her mouth and nose before her body decomposed because it was still  attached to the hair on the side of her head.  The one strand of duct tape would have been enough to cover her nose and mouth.  She had two strands overlapping each other and one diagonal across the face.  Mom never reports her missing ever would never have reported her missing if grandmother  hadn't called the police.  The day she supposedly, the day she disappears, that we know she disappears, a mom goes out 
[01:18:30]  to see her boyfriend.  They start whooping it up.  She enters these hot body contests.  She goes, get tattoos and stuff like this.  Mom's car smells like a decomposing human body.  Okay.  Alerted on to by cadaver dogs and the guy called Dr. Death, who's Dr. Voss, who runs the body  farm in Tennessee and knows more about decomposing human bodies, the smell of it, the composition  of it than anybody in the world. 
[01:19:00]  Okay.  And then when she is confronted with this, mom lies.  Mom makes up stories about the nanny took her from me at the park.  Then Annie took her to take care of her and then didn't give her back to me.  I didn't call the police because I was doing this manhunt on my own.  You know, when you, when you add all these things up, it's like, no, you killed her.  Now it's a circumstantial evidence case, but you, you know, a lot of cases are circumstantial  evidence case.  So I think it was a very powerful case. 
[01:19:30]  And then mother's response, her theory makes no sense because if you take the whole drowning  theory, what you're saying is, and I remember Casey Anthony's father and, and, uh, mother  the, were like doting grandparents over Kaylee.  I mean, they built her a little playground in the backyard.  There was all the evidence was they absolutely adored her.  So what you're, what, um, Jose Bias was asking this jury to believe, which I guess apparently  they did, um, was that this, this grandfather, the story was Casey wakes up and she goes out 
[01:20:00]  and, um, father says, where's Kaylee?  And they go looking for her body and I mean, looking for her, they find, and the father  finds her body in the pool and says, look what you did.  You're going to go to prison for the rest of your life for child neglect.  Okay.  If you believe that, then that means dad, who is a former police officer and knows like  I know that tragic accidents like this happen all the time and nobody's going to prison.  It's sad.  It's tragic.  It happens.  Um, he, nonetheless, he takes the body of his granddaughter who he loves so much and 
[01:20:30]  throws it out into the woods to be basically eaten up by animals to protect his daughter,  Casey, who's not going to go to prison, but because he loves her so much yet when she gets  charged wrongfully with the murder of her child and he knows she didn't murder the child.  She drowned in the pool.  It's an accident.  He doesn't come forward and say, no, it's an accident.  We should have called and all this stuff.  He just lets her sit in jail for three years.  She never raises his defense until the day of opening statement.  She sat in jail for three years, but she could have walked, you know, for the drowning.  Uh, and he, he lets her sit there and go through a trial where she might be put in the death 
[01:21:00]  chamber.  And also the duct tape too.  Why was the duct tape there if she drowned?  Who duct tapes a dead body?  To make it look like a murder.  You know, people try to make, no, people try to make murders look like accidents.  They don't try to make accidents look like murders.  So, you know.  So why weren't you the prosecutor on this?  Yeah, you summed that up pretty nicely.  That was a pretty good summation.  That was my closing argument.  That was your closing argument right there.  They couldn't prove that she drowned, right?  Uh, no, no, no, they couldn't.  Of course. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah, they didn't really have a cause of death.  What the fuck was the jury listening to?  Well, did they, did they overcharge her with like, with the problem they could not convict  her of murder or it could have been an accidental death or.  No, but they got instructed on manslaughter.  Oh, they did.  Yeah, yeah.  They, they, you know, what happened was that people said, well, you know, you shouldn't  have gone for the death penalty.  Well, the jury had options.  They didn't have to go with murder one.  They could have gone with murder two.  They could have gone with manslaughter.  Uh, they just weren't, they, you know, I mean, we see it all the time as a judge.  I see jurors who do not want to convict.  I had a woman who was shot five times in the back with her, by her husband. 
[01:22:00]  Witnesses saw it.  She lived.  Mind you, I would have been stuck with a pencil and I would have died of lead poisoning.  She gets shot five times in the back and she lives and comes to testify.  And, uh, the witnesses testified that he put on no defense.  His lawyer basically in closing got up and said, my client didn't shoot her.  Her new boyfriend shot her.  Now, first of all, there was no evidence there was a new boyfriend that actually, he had been  beating her, her whole marriage, the whole marriage.  And she said, I had enough.  And she moved out two weeks later.  He says, come on, let's talk about this. 
[01:22:30]  So she met him to talk about it.  And he shot her five times in the back.  So there was no evidence there was a boyfriend, let alone that the boyfriend shot her.  And the jury walked her and, and the prosecutor went out to the jurors outside and said, can  you please tell me why you found him not guilty?  And they said, which is very interesting because it's similar to the jurors in the Casey Anthony  case.  They said, uh, we thought there was something else going on behind the scenes that we didn't  get to see.  Really?  I mean, if that isn't rank speculation and, and the jurors in the Casey Anthony case said,  you know, we thought George was involved in some way, nevermind the fact that there was 
[01:23:00]  no evidence of George's involvement.  Uh, they just, there are some jurors who one, don't have it in them to say guilty and look  for any excuse to say not guilty.  And there are two jurors see crime shows on television and crime shows never end the way  you think they will.  They, you know, it's Jimmy, it's Jimmy, it's Jimmy.  No, it's Opie.  Yeah.  So they sit there and they look like, okay, I see, I see all the evidence you've given me  here.  Yeah.  It looks, sure.  It looks like it's Jimmy, but I can solve this. 
[01:23:30]  I know I can figure this out.  They don't believe that one plus one is two because the crime shows are always telling  me something different.  Right.  Well, they're looking for the twist.  I thought you said, you see the jury get it wrong a lot then, huh?  It happens.  I wouldn't.  What's the percentage?  I, that, I don't know.  But I mean, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's your world, but it happens.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Way more than it should.  The thing I saw with the Casey Anthony thing was, was I didn't have a story.  I didn't have the prosecution presenting me with a viable timeline of what happened and, 
[01:24:00]  and all right, she did this, this, here's how the kid died.  And when the kid died and here's where she, it was a little ramshackle.  And that's why I was like, I don't think they got it here.  Well, that, but there's no one that when you get instructed on, on the law, they, they,  one of the instructions is not, there has to be a timeline.  One of the instructions is not, you have to know the motive.  You know, you don't have to know the motive.  She could, she could kill her daughter because she wants to be free.  She could kill her daughter because she's angry at her mom.  Yeah. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  She could kill her daughter for a lot of reasons.  And, and the prosecution can never prove motive unless the defendant gives it to her.  Yeah.  By telling somebody or some, or they can prove pieces together by other evidence because  they can't crawl into the defendant's mind and the defendant has a fifth amendment right  to remain silent.  So they can't force the defendant to tell them why they did something, why they would do something  or not.  So that's why it's not an element of the crime.  All you have to prove is that she murdered her daughter beyond a reasonable doubt.  So we have, you know, they may, their defense made a lot about, oh, they don't, they don't  have cause of death.  They don't have, they don't have the cause of death. 
[01:25:00]  They have the manner of death because the medical examiner testified that it was a homicide,  but they didn't have cause.  Was she strangled?  Was she shot?  Was she poisoned?  They don't have that, but that's, you don't need that.  I mean, that's, that's, there are people who are prosecuted when you don't even find the  body, right?  If you don't find the body, you, how are you going to prove cause of death?  Yeah.  You know?  So, uh, the question isn't that the question is after you've looked at all the evidence,  has the state proven that this person killed this person? 
[01:25:30]  But at least, even if you don't have a body, something like before they found Lacey Peterson's  body, um, you were prosecuting before.  Yeah, they were exactly.  And they had a, some type of timeline where it's like, okay, look, she's here this day.  He goes fishing.  She disappears.  There's like, it's, it makes more sense than this very spread out.  And I know you don't have a timeline, but they didn't have a timeline in the sense that  they had, it was father's day. 
[01:26:00]  Kaylee and Casey were together with, uh, with George, the father.  And then the next, that was the last time they were seen together.  And then they had the timeline of her living with her boyfriend the next day, telling everybody,  Oh, Casey is with her nanny or Casey's with her grandma.  You know, she'd tell the boyfriend Casey's with grandma.  And she'd tell the grandma Casey's with the nanny.  I understand what you're saying there, but timeline, here's what I'm thinking.  You want a boat and the ocean involved.  The thing is you can, yeah, you can imagine a juror can sit there and imagine, all right, 
[01:26:30]  there is Scott Peterson.  He's in the boat.  Uh, we don't know anything yet, but he, he rented a boat.  He went fishing.  He took the boat out.  They could picture that scene.  The body's in there.  He's tossing it over.  Right.  Like the, you can know that from what happened with the Casey Anthony thing.  There was nothing like I'm picturing her drowning the kid.  I'm picturing her strangling the child.  There was not that moment that put in the juror's mind, her killing the child.  And I think that's very important. 
[01:27:00]  Well, that's, that's true of most circumstantial evidence cases.  You know, it's, it's, it's ideal if you have somebody who says I saw it and then you're  just evaluating their credibility and then when you, that's direct evidence.  And then when you're piecing evidence together, it's it, you're building inferences, you know,  this inference that goes on this inference.  And then, you know, if you build it strong enough, you overcome reasonable doubt.  You can, you can never overcome all doubt.  All doubt.  Right, right.  No, because the only way to overcome all doubt is for the jurors to have seen it themselves.  And a confession.  And at that, even then, because it comes in and goes, look, they promised me if I confess 
[01:27:30]  or they beat me or they turn to record her off and they threaten me or whatever.  So you, the only way you can overcome all doubt is if you saw it yourself.  And if you saw it yourself, you couldn't be a juror because you're a witness.  So, you know, the, the only, the standard is reasonable doubt.  Yeah.  Didn't in the, in the Peterson case, wasn't there a strand of hair found in the boat and  he lied and said that she had never been in the boat.  And that was one of the things that got him convicted was a strand of her hair found in that  boat and how it was on a block that was, uh, in the boat or some, something in the boat. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah.  It was like cement dust and red, with her shoes in it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or more of the O.P.  and Anthony Wars to the week.  Contact for you next.

Right now, I want to talk about the biggest event that I've ever gotten to be a part of.  And that was the community watching of Sharknado.  The sci-fi original movie where a tornado sucks sharks up into the sky and rains them down on California.  That's right.  It's very realistic. 
[01:33:30]  It's chilling.  It's horrifying.  Sharknado was introduced to us this week.  And this is how Opie and Anthony found out about Sharknado.  We've got to play the Sharknado trailer from YouTube for Jim Norton.  Okay, I think it might be the same.  All right, let's make sure.  This is a Ferris wheel.  Ferris wheel getting blown away by the storm. 
[01:34:00]  Looking sort of like Coney Island.  Oh, boy.  That was probably Santa Monica Bear, actually.  Oh, wait.  A guy picks up a thing just like Brody.  And he puts the fucking tank in its mouth like Brody.  That's just the jaws rip off.  Now we're watching Ferris wheel kind of come apart.  Oh, Ferris wheel's rolling now. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  Down the dock, I think.  They don't evacuate here before the hurricane.  They let you ride it out.  Everyone's running away from the Ferris wheel, which is now rolling and crushing people.  So instead of going to the side, they run straight ahead.  Yeah, it's Santa Monica.  It is Santa Monica, okay.  Yeah.  It was.  How far is this Ferris wheel?  Oh, a guy just got crushed.  Oh, it just hit a building.  They wouldn't go through a building.  How do you know?  Have you ever seen a Ferris wheel hit a building?  All right, good point.  In the middle of a Sharknado?  Right. 
[01:35:00]  You got me.  With a rip off.  That was horrible.  It's almost like they're just doing funny trailers.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  They don't mean it.  And they have to make like a movie for it.  People love these dumb movies.  They really do.  They do very, very well.  They do, right?  Yeah.  And Sharknado is going to kill tonight.  It should, too.  Yeah.  What's better than Sharknado?  Shark to Puss.  Yeah.  That's debatable.  Dinosaur Forest.  Shark Aids. 
[01:35:30]  Do you want to see the trailer for Dino Shark?  No.  They love sharks.  Sharks are frightening.  What's Dino Shark about?  A prehistoric shark?  It should be just a shark.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  Sharks really don't change much.  This is a shark with brown eyes instead of blue.  All right, let's look at Dino Shark.  What the hell?  Alaska.  A piece of ice fell off. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  And apparently it's going to unfreeze.  Oh, Dino Shark.  They look like crusty sharks.  Yeah.  It's a shark with barnacles on it.  Yeah.  The CGI is so bad on these.  Yeah.  It looks like a kid in his tub.  And now there's more boaters that these prehistoric sharks are going to come.  And the CGI is kind of important for these movies, don't you think?  Wow.  I love it.  Did you see how big Dino Shark is? 
[01:36:30]  It's massive, dude.  Yeah.  But wait, that wasn't big.  That was a swimming pool.  Biting legs off.  Yeah, it's just a lot of underwater shots.  Dino Shark changes size a lot.  Yeah, it does.  Oh, boy.  Uh-oh.  Oh, there's a guy parasailing.  Yay!  This is the same thing as...  That's the same thing as the bungee.  Sure is.  Wow.  Here comes a girl as a nice tiny... 
[01:37:00]  Going in the water.  Oh.  Look, the shark's jerking off instead of eating her.  Oh, boy.  Oh, there's half of her.  Who is that guy?  Oh, that's the dude.  We had him on once.  Yeah, he's been on.  Who is that?  We had him on?  Oh, yeah.  He used to be on Six Feet Under.  No, he started on MTV, though.  No, that's not Simon.  Oh, was it?  No.  It looks like him.  Okay.  Who is that?  Jeff Steer.  He's jumping over Dino Shark?  No, he's throwing a grenade. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, he threw a hand grenade at Dino Shark.  Oh.  Oh, it just kind of blew a fin off a Dino Shark.  Oh.  And then he lands next to Dino Shark.  Wow.  Wow, that's scary.  He gets top billing like that.  That's pretty good.  Yeah.  This is so stupid.  Why would you want your name on top?  I want my name lifted.  Oh.  Oh, no.  The CGI in Dino Shark is pretty much on the level of the cartoons interacting with real people 
[01:38:00]  and Roger Rabbit.  Yeah, yeah.  It's just like drawn.  It's horrible.  There's no depth to them.  There's no color matching or contrast matching.  No, that one's a whole story.  It looks terrible.  It's a whole story.  It doesn't need the effect.  It's all on the page.  A good story transcends the effect.  Yeah.  Is there a Sharknado trailer on YouTube that's different or was that the same shit?  Shark.  Because it's all about Sharknado tonight.  These are fucking great movies.  Oh, Chippa likes these?  Fuck yeah.  I wrote one just like it.  What was it called? 
[01:38:30]  It's called Pekka Shark.  Of course it is.  He's got a giant Pekka.  Pekka.  And he drags it over people and eats them.  Pekka.  All right.  No worries.  Why didn't we get anybody from Sharknado on your show?  Oh, why didn't Roland get us some Sharknado?  Roland has failed us.  Guys, we got the guy from Sharknado.  We got the director, the producer of Sharknado.  You guys definitely would have said yes to Ian Ziering, right?  Yes.  Yeah, sure.  Or his hat and glasses. 
[01:39:00]  Jesus.  Ian Ziering.  I'm tired.  Ian Ziering.  Was there a movie called Mansquito?  No way.  Mansquito.  Dean Harding on Twitter.  Watch out for the Mansquito.  Tell me, Mansquito is a classic.  Is there a Mansquito?  Yeah.  Let's see.  I want to see me some Mansquito.  Sure.  Well, we can watch the entire movie, which is 86 minutes.  Oh, let's do that. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, boy.  Here's the trailer.  The disease affects both young and old.  Every man is home.  And they're incephalitis.  He was scheduled to take part in our experimental drug testing program.  What are you saying?  You're experimenting on condoms?  Too little.  Who was that?  Too much.  And who knows what you'd get.  Open it!  Uh-oh.  Convict gets out?  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Is there any of that mosquito blood in them? 
[01:40:00]  Are they...  Oh, no.  Oh.  I bet a bunch of, like, uh, mosquitoes bite him.  Oh.  Oh, no.  Yeah, yeah.  Uh, another mutation.  He's a man and a mosquito.  Oh, shit.  He's turning into a man's mosquito.  Oh, no.  Like the fly?  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly like the fly.  You know how bummed I'd be if I had a picnic planned with him the next day? 
[01:40:30]  He's a brundle-squito.  Uh-oh.  Oh, she's becoming a mosquito.  Wow.  A cunt-squito.  A cunt-squito.  A cunt-squito.  She just buzzes around and annoys you like every other woman I've ever dated.  He wants some meat, Tom.  That's why he's a mosquito.  She flies in and bites you when the game is on.  He's here!  You don't know what you're up against!  You can't go in there.  Is that Parker Lewis?  Hey!  That's Squito!  Parker Lewis can't lose. 
[01:41:00]  I don't know why they're shooting.  Giant can of rage.  Can I slice one?  It totally is.  And she's someone, too.  Man-squito's just attacking people.  And he was somebody.  Oh, Mosquito Man is called.  It's called Mosquito Man.  Mosquito Man.  Mosquito Man.  Well, I guess that actually confirms that Parker Lewis can indeed lose.  Yes!  Parker Lewis can lose.  Wow.  That's terrible. 
[01:41:30]  Mosquito Man.  It's Mosquito Man slash Man-squito.  Right.  So, you know.  Probably later on, they realized Man-squito is just a much more marketable.  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah.  Ah, Man-squito.  Yes.  Sounds like Bull-shito.  Wow.  Yeah.  Sci-fi is obviously spent in the hundreds of dollars.  But they have spent a lot of money.  How can they make their money back on these?  They're huge. 
[01:42:00]  I guess through advertising.  They are huge.  They didn't spend a lot of money on these things.  The CGI is horrendous.  They're terrible.  They're very culty.  And I think they get an audience over time as kind of a little fun thing.  Yeah.  And they're getting known for doing these things.  Right.  Like, I think they used to seriously think they were making science fiction movies.  Right.  And they'd get, you know, low budget.  But I think they took them seriously until people started really laughing at them.  Right.  And they just said, all right, fuck it. 
[01:42:30]  We're all in.  Let's just not even try to fucking fake this anymore.  Yeah, because Debbie Gibson and Tiffany were in here promoting one of those movies.  Yeah.  What was the name of theirs again?  Something versus something.  Oh, right.  Kunt versus Kunt.  But they spelled it with a K, so it's not offensive.  Yeah.  And they said Kunt.  Do you think that wouldn't be offensive still to people?  Called Kunt versus Kunt.  Oh, Mega Python versus Gatoroid.  Yeah, that's right.  About my penis against the Gatoroids. 
[01:43:00]  Jesus.  Oh, God.  Oh, no, it's a giant penis fucking an ass.  Yes.  It's giving him a Gatoroid.  See?  Yes.  And I thought it was Megaroid.  Oh.  I ruined that one first.  Isn't it Megaroid?  No, it's Megapython.  No, Megapython.  Megapython.  Gatoroid.  And Gatoroid.  I love that stuff when I'm doing sports.  Yeah, that's what happens when your asshole's getting a good workout.  You need some Gatoroid.  It's this character.  People are still trying to say, I got the official trailer right here, Sam Roberts. 
[01:43:30]  Sharknado, official asylum trailer.  Too violent for TV.  It's up on the Facebook, too.  Oh, really?  Sam Roberts getting yelled at?  Not yelled at.  Huh?  How much more can we see?  Yeah, I don't know.  We just watched two.  No, we didn't watch trailers.  We were watching, like, highlights.  No, we watched the official trailer from SyFy.  No, we didn't.  Uh-oh.  No, we didn't.  Okay, then we didn't.  Damn.  We did not.  You're in trouble now. 
[01:44:00]  You're right.  With who?  With who, exactly.  With who?  Oh, he's just making things up to pester me.  No, I'm not.  He's just being disagreeable.  Nope.  That's not true.  Okay.  That's being corrected.  I guess from the weather in Sharknado, there's a lot of flooding.  So when the sharks flop down into the water that the flooding is from, they can, you know. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  Jimmy made a great point about, you know.  Is that it?  They allow people to hang out until the hurricane is pretty much on them.  Dude, who rides the Ferris wheel until you see the storm?  This is where you want Bloomberg.  We have a tornado of sharks coming.  Get off the...  Is that one we haven't seen?  Stevie Knight hooked it up on Twitter.  All right, let's see.  Different.  Let's see.  All right.  Who's the official trailer?  Storm.  That's what's driven them all up north. 
[01:45:00]  I've never seen so many.  Oh, shit.  It's the boss from Big.  It's the guy who goes, uh...  It's a bug.  It's a bug.  It's a building.  It's a bug.  That guy.  Baskins?  That was him.  Yeah.  He's in Sharknado.  Wasn't that the father from Home Alone, too?  Yep.  Yeah.  The father from Home Alone.  And he was a...  There you go.  He was the cop in Sopranos.  Who?  He was a criminal.  Yes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's good.  He was also a bad guy in something else.  Wait a minute.  He was a... 
[01:45:30]  But the father from Home Alone is now in Sharknado.  That's a bit of a drop-off, don't you think?  Drop-off?  What else was he in?  Although it's been 20 years.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's right.  He was the guy in fucking Sopranos.  That's all he had no respect for.  Wasn't he almost...  Was he a teacher or something?  There's something else he's been in.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's awesome.  Is he awesome?  Yeah, dude.  How about in Sharknado?  We're gonna find out.  You can't be bad in that movie.  You wouldn't last.  Yeah, true.  True.  You can't be sitting there next to Ian Ziering in a movie like Sharknado. 
[01:46:00]  Absolutely.  You gotta switch seats.  I'm gonna keep doing Ian Ziering.  Absolutely.  Radar love.  All right, sorry.  Sharknado?  Oh, by the way, who was right here and who was wrong?  Stephen Knight.  No.  Oh, man.  I brought it to the show's attention through Stephen Knight,  and you refused to believe that there was another trailer out there.  I didn't refuse to believe.  You absolutely refused to believe.  I've never seen so many of them or so.  Wow.  It's really even raining. 
[01:46:30]  It's flooding here.  Not the plumbing.  The ocean.  He needs to go home.  I'm not going anywhere.  Storm's coming.  It's coming fast.  Shark went flying through a window.  Wait.  Can you go back?  I want to see how full is that pier when the tornado hits.  I've never seen more people having fun.  Tornadoes come around quickly there, Jim Norton.  Did you hear Ian's earring?  He said, it's coming, and it's coming fast.  Fast.  Yeah, yeah.  He didn't expect it.  Oh, I thought he was talking about me. 
[01:47:00]  They're in a bar.  Oh, shit.  You need to go home.  Big, huge window.  Storm's coming.  It's coming fast.  Hey, man.  Shark compression.  A lot of people.  I just can't sit back and watch this.  See, it's the flooded streets.  Tornadoes heading towards the airport.  We need to destroy it before it gets to them.  Shooting sharks out of the sky.  That would be pretty cool to do it.  Shark's going down on us.  Oh, man. 
[01:47:30]  Whoa.  He cut the shark in half with a chainsaw.  Into the tornadoes.  Too dangerous.  That's exactly how that would happen.  Too many of them.  We're going to need a bigger chopper.  And there's the scene with the giant Ferris wheel.  Whoa.  Shark they hope.  Nice.  Check your local listings.  It's fucking believable.  That shit could happen.  I like it.

Headed towards the top of the worst of the week countdown.  My name is Sam Roberts, and we are sitting here counting down all the great moments that happened this week on the Opie and Anthony show.  The guests will have to wait because still to come is David Spade as well as Charlie Day from Always Sunny.  First, I wanted to share with you Ant's recollection of one of the wildest compound parties he ever had, mainly because Bobo was there. 
[01:52:30]  We all know, unfortunately, we all know who Bobo is at this point.  He showed up to Ant's house.  He's running around.  Big A was there.  Travis was there.  I mean, everybody, who's who of the Opie and Anthony show.  I don't want to spoil anything, so let's let Ant tell you about his last compound party. 
[01:53:00]  And then it's just a full blast soiree.  Just family, friends.  And listeners.  Drunkards.  A few listeners that have earned my trust over the years.  Right.  Bobo's earned your trust?  No.  That is.  Because I know some of the shit that went down, and I was thinking to myself, I don't know how I would handle having Bobo just wandering around my house.  I don't care.  It was fucking, you know. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, good for you.  You got, like, the outside, the pool area, the basement, the fucking kitchen area.  Like, I barely had to see him until, you know, we did the compound show.  I'd worry that he would eat my kid or something.  No, he was, you know.  He'd lose its scrabble to your kid.  I'm sorry.  I'm just kidding.  Yeah.  Well, Bobo was there, of course.  Bobo got the big invite. 
[01:54:00]  Bobo finally got the big invite.  He must have been very excited.  He was so excited.  I figure, you know what, he did such a great job the Friday before vacation with the retarded  Laverne and Shirley.  God, that show was great.  That was fantastic.  God, we did that show.  Oh, that feels like months ago.  It's amazing.  But I figured out, why not?  Why not?  We'll get the old Bobo in there.  And he was a fucking disaster.  Why?  Just a disaster.  He shows up, and he's got his cousin with him. 
[01:54:30]  Okay.  Hold on.  Did you say why was he a disaster?  Yeah.  Because he had autism.  He's on the spectrum?  Yeah.  Wow.  He's got a cousin with him, you know, and his cousin's a regular guy.  You know?  Regular, normal guy.  Does he look like Bobo?  Not at all.  Oh, okay.  No.  Some cousins look alike.  No, no.  He didn't look like Bobo.  No.  And, uh...  Holy shit, what's that?  It's Bobo.  So, uh, the first thing is, Bobo shows up, and, um, apparently he didn't see the people 
[01:55:00]  that showed up right before him walk around the right side of my house to go into the yard.  So I was told there's some guy wandering around in your front yard with a backpack on.  He was just walking around, uh, on my front lawn.  So, so I went to the door and, uh, you know, ushered him in.  Uh, within, within 15 minutes, he was already, like, loud and a little buzzed. 
[01:55:30]  Wow.  Yeah, yeah.  Within 15 minutes.  Wow.  I'm like, oh.  Oh, was he doing shots?  No, he, like, just had a, I guess it was a screwdriver, vodka, OJ, something like that.  And you gave him the address this time?  Uh, yeah, yeah.  What's he doing?  Well, because the last time he was there, like a goldfish.  The last time he was there, he had to come with a bag on his head.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So he didn't know where the address was.  Yeah, he put a bag on his head last time, so he wouldn't know the address.  And I'm like, why was he out of control? 
[01:56:00]  Did he do shots?  What an idiot I am.  On a regular day, it takes everything he can to keep his brain together.  Right.  So he's, you know.  So I would imagine one beer in, and that's it.  Yeah.  I mean, he's there by the fire pit area, trying to have some kind of conversation with my  Uncle Tony.  My Uncle Tony's just looking like, what the fuck is this guy?  And then I like the meds, and I, oh, right, he likes the meds.  Yeah, on the show, I wasn't on for a while, but then I get back on, shut up! 
[01:56:30]  Shut up, cunts, it's bobo time!  Oh, there it is, yes.  Wow.  And boy, was it bobo time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He tends to take over.  Yeah, he, uh, so I made sure I had taken his wallet, his watch, his keys, and his phone  for safekeeping, because, you know, he's going to jump in the pool, try to do something stupid, 
[01:57:00]  and ruin all of his stuff, and, uh, so I did that, uh, and then, and then he, he went  downstairs, and decided he was going to karaoke, and do a little dancing, I guess, I don't  know, he was fucking out of control, yelling at the top of his lungs, uh, babbling, just  babbling.  So then, I guess they thought it was a good idea to put him on the, uh, compound show,  uh, where he just started showing his ass, and, uh, his, his micropenis, and it's, and 
[01:57:30]  people were horrified.  I have guests.  Were they really horrified, though?  Yeah, some of them were.  What were you doing, by the way, while the autistic was broadcasting his dick and asshole  from your home?  What were you doing while this was happening?  While, excuse me, while the drunk autistic was broadcasting his asshole from your home?  I believe the answer to that is the backstroke. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  You were upstairs taking a dip, were you?  Yeah, it's a little dip in the pool.  I like Jimmy's voice of reason, because I get excited.  I'm not going to lie to you, I think it's cool as fuck.  And Jimmy's like, what the fuck is wrong with you people?  Just the level of irresponsibility is almost staggering.  Almost staggering.  You think I would show some concern here, but I'm like, wow, this is, sounds great.  It was a hell of a shindig.  He's showing his dick and balls and his asshole?  Yeah, yeah.  Which I don't have a problem with.  I just wonder where the host of the home is. 
[01:58:30]  You'd think the host would be there laughing with everyone, instead of upstairs, just fucking  taking a dip in the pool.  It was wonderful weather.  The pool was great temperature.  So he's showing his dick, his balls, and his asshole, and what, your aunt's trying to  find the guacamole dip?  Yeah, yeah, something like that.  I love it.  Sure.  Right around the corner, there's just like normal behavior going on, normal party behavior.  In the kitchen area, you know, a lot of the ladies like to kibitz in the kitchen while  there's somebody vomiting in my basement. 
[01:59:00]  He vomited?  Yeah.  Bobo then got so drunk.  Oh, no.  That, um, right there.  And you could see on the compound foot.  Well, you can't see because it won't get rebroadcast.  But I watched it.  And, uh, apparently somebody on the phones had told Bobo, hey, Bobo, what's that beer  next to you?  Chug it.  Oh, see.  And, uh, Bobo, listening to the callers, which is his mistake, uh, picked up the glass  and, uh, and just chugged it. 
[01:59:30]  And then you could see him kind of looking around, his head's down, and then he just  puked all over his lap on the floor.  I, uh, question that hasn't been raised yet, based on some of the video that we're starting  to see.  Yeah, yeah.  Why is he wearing pants and no shirt?  He was taking his shirt off.  He was dancing.  Oh, with no shirt on?  Yeah, of course.  Why?  Because once again, the answer is he's autistic.  Oh.  Oh.  No one understands that part of the equation ever with Bobo.  And I want to reiterate. 
[02:00:00]  Part of his brain is basically missing.  Yeah, I want to, and I also want to, the answer to the answer to the question, the better  question, why is he in your home to begin with?  That's just nothing but trouble.  I want to tell you, he had a great time.  I would hope so.  This was the time of his life there.  You could say the same thing if he was just bouncing a ball and it had a Mets emblem on  it.  He had a great time.  He was just bouncing a ball with a Mets emblem.  That's all it takes.  Holy fuck.  So we should get some of this video out there. 
[02:00:30]  Why don't you go through the Compound show and throw some highlights out there?  I might do that.  Can we throw some highlights on our show even?  I might do that.  I'll go through it.  How about we find some highlights for tomorrow's show?  Or do we have it now?  Where is that?  Big A.  Tell Big A.  He videoed while it was happening.  Big A's an ass in the room.  Egg Fatty.  Fucking 98% of the listeners just wrote, what?  Oh, he's talking to me. 
[02:01:00]  It's about time.  Oh, brother.  I feel like we have a relationship because I listen to him every day.  But Big A threw some videos up.  Great.  Maybe you shouldn't broadcast this at all then.  What?  Well, because if it's being broadcasted once, that shit's going to get out there.  You're worried about a rebroadcast, but maybe you should worry about a broadcast.  This was from his home, somebody, this was another trusted idiot in the home.  I figure he's a dummy.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:01:30]  Well, anyway.  What?  You look a little annoyed.  Yeah.  Well, he just threw up on my floor.  So perhaps...  We can't play this?  No, not that.  We can play the...  Take a look at the video of Bobo puking?  Yeah.  I don't know what else is on there.  Look, we play with no volume and just see if there's anything.  Or can we...  We have a dump.  What, the puke?  Well, the other thing looks pretty crazy, too.  Oh, I don't know what that is, so I don't care.  If...  Can we at least play it, and then if you feel uncomfortable, dump out?  Yeah.  Or play... 
[02:02:00]  I understand your...  I understand your concern.  It's up to you, really.  This is all my big A with, like, fucking...  It's video from in the room.  Who cares?  He's in there.  What are you doing?  What?  No, not you.  He wants to feel like he has something special.  I know.  What is he doing?  He wants to feel like he has something special for everyone.  He's not trying to get the angle.  Hey, Scoop.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hey, Scoop.  What are you doing?  And the thing with Big A is he would take it down. 
[02:02:30]  He's such a harmless guy.  Like...  Oh, we love Big A.  Yeah.  He would just never do it intentionally.  He probably figured it was all right.  Yeah.  But if it's not, it's not.  No, I was just...  No, no.  So, man, this is your party, man.  What do you want to play from it?  Well, Bobo...  Obviously, there's a few...  Bobo puking.  Yeah, we should do it.  All right, so here's Bobo puking.  Yeah.  At the big compound, 4th of July party.  It's right after he puked.  Bobo, you just threw up in my studio.  This is why I wanted to paste myself. 
[02:03:00]  He shit out of his mouth.  Bobo, you just threw up in my studio.  What do you think about that?  This is why I wanted to paste myself.  You are too drunk.  You didn't paste yourself.  Are you going to...  I'm going to Disney World.  He said...  How are you laughing and having fun?  He just threw up on your floor.  The floor...  The floor is wood.  Oh, okay.  And it's not like seams or anything.  It's like almost a linoleum kind of floor.  So you knew...  Easily clean up. 
[02:03:30]  Okay.  It wasn't a rug.  It wasn't anything.  And you didn't get it on your equipment.  Yeah.  And it was his drunk vomiting.  It's all over his pants in that video.  Oh, he was a disaster.  Would you have been mad if that was upstairs on your sofa?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  That I wouldn't have been...  So you're not throwing your house away?  No, no.  I heard...  That rock.  Oh, this is...  What is this video?  Okay.  We got moments from...  This is from No Filter Paul.  Oh.  This is a long one.  This is just Bobo in the backyard, though. 
[02:04:00]  Anthony may not even be in this one.  Yeah, that's fine.  A little Bobo drunk in...  How long is the video?  Jumping in the pool with a hamburger.  Twelve minutes long.  What's wrong?  What the...  What the fuck?  He jumped in the pool with a burger in his hand.  I know, but why does it have to be twelve minutes long?  He's in his clothes.  With a burger.  He jumped in with a burger in his hand.  And his glasses and everything.  Wait, there you are.  And you're encouraging this behavior.  Of course I was.  He's in...  I told him to jump.  He's got his shoes on still.  I told him to jump.  But you had done the responsible thing and taken his while. 
[02:04:30]  Yes, I did take all of his stuff.  And did you assume that he could swim?  Or did you know he could swim?  I assumed.  Okay.  I assumed.  Okay.  Travis?  Oh, sorry.  He's been in the pool before.  Yeah, he's been in the pool.  Fair enough.  I remember when this happened, Anthony was really annoyed because he didn't get the line that  he needed for the video before Bobo jumped in the pool.  That's true.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What was the line you were looking for?  Who even knows at this point?  But it's true.  He can't take direction very well. 
[02:05:00]  Surprising.  I'm impressed that he's got the left shoe on the left foot.  I think it's a win if that happens.  All right.  So there's Bobo.  He's jumping in the pool.  Sure.  Why not?  Yeah.  Take your shoes off.  He's already hammered, I think.  It's light out still.  Yeah.  But he's got to take his shoes off.  He just fell over. 
[02:05:30]  Trying to take his shoe off.  And I'm just mad.  What is the line?  He can't stand up.  Wait, this is in Anderson Silva footage?  Bobo, right?  Get on the ride.  He can't stand.  I think he gets bites of his burger.  He's holding his burger and he jumps in the pool.  Fully clothed.  I think he's drowning.  Yeah, with a burger.  Did he lose his glasses?  He's wearing his glasses when he jumped in. 
[02:06:00]  You know what I'm saying?  Don't drown.  Don't drown.  I told him.  He's eating.  No, he's eating.  He ate the burger.  Good for him.  He's a good boy.  He's wearing his glasses when he jumped in.  And then he pops his head up.  No more glasses.  No glasses.  By the way, the pool was literally green the next day.  By the way, he can't swim.  No, he's not very good at treading water, is he?  He's doing a dunce paddle.  Oh, that's for Stan's helping him out.  He's still got his clothes on. 
[02:06:30]  There you go.  There it is.  That was just like a beast whale.  Poor Bobo.  How long had he been there at this point?  Because it's still light out.  He couldn't...  Less than an hour.  Less than an hour.  Less than an hour.  I thought he said he was trying to pace himself.  Yeah, yeah.  And I told him beforehand, I felt like I was back with my ex, my ex-wife.  I told him beforehand, Bobo, slow down.  Pace yourself.  Had you ever told her to slow down?  Oh, yeah.  Did it work?  No.  As well as it did this time. 
[02:07:00]  Bobo!  That was terrible.  Did you have glasses?  Didn't you have glasses?  Didn't you have glasses?  My Uncle Tony.  You have glasses?  I guess that was drunk.  Whoa!  That called me for a blast.  Get up and fucking come on to the table.  Don't be an asshole, Bobo.  Don't fall down.  Don't worry.  Don't fall down.  Think about every move you make.  I wish you'd have this conversation with yourself. 
[02:07:30]  He started walking into a bush.  I love a cry.  Don't throw up at a pool.  Bobo!  I knew this was for the troops.  The guy had to do it.  You said I'm doing this for the troops?  I think so.  The whole family's there.  There's kids there.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  This was the weirdest party.  There was like a dozen kids and everyone else.  This is bad for wine.  It tastes good, Bobo.  Don't worry.  If I would have known about wine, I would have took the wine. 
[02:08:00]  Bobo, this is all your stuff.  I'm going to...  Here's what I'm going to do.  Hold on.  Was I at the party?  You're not really comfortable in the party right now.  All right.  I know.  I want to get my stuff.  No, no, no.  I'm going to put it inside, okay?  Yeah.  And I'm going to know where it is.  So when you need to get it, I'll let you know.  By the way, could you pause?  I completely forgot where I put it.  Oh, really?  Not only that, but I was asleep.  In my room, which was locked at the end of the night, early morning, whatever. 
[02:08:30]  And I guess Bobo walked around my house looking for his stuff for an hour.  Let me get this straight.  So you went upstairs and fell asleep while a drunken autistic walked around your house searching for his stuff.  What time was it that he finally left?  Wait, people are...  Maybe nine in the morning?  People are allowed to stay after you go upstairs and lock your door?  Yeah.  Wow.  If Bobo slept over your house.  I could never do that.  I would never be able to do that.  This is going to be the scene of the Winterland murders. 
[02:09:00]  It's literally the fucking house in Boogie Nights that they tried to rob is more responsibly run than this house.  Shit.  And then when you get up, are there people still there?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, I looked out the window, I saw a vehicle.  I didn't even know whose it was.  So Bobo slept over your house.  Aw.  Well, sleep is kind of a thing.  As much as Sling Blade slept over the guy that ran the hospital's house, he sat on the edge of the bed the whole night. 
[02:09:30]  Bobo sat on the couch, I think.  And that was pretty much it.  In your seat.  Yeah.  In the pants that he vomited on.  And swam in.  And swam in.  Well, he swam in them.  Yeah.  And so, but he woke up, well, he was up looking for his stuff.  And eventually, I guess he found it and made his way home.  So, win-win. 
[02:10:00]  Do you have to replace a lot of stuff after these parties?  Oddly enough, no.  People are well-behaved.  That's good.  Yeah, I don't get, you know, they're not throwing things through windows or anything.  No, of course not.  And, you know, it's kind of, you know, you've got a guy like Bobo running around your house for a party.  It's kind of difficult.  But he had a great time, let me tell you.  That's important.  Well, then don't show Jimmy the other video that someone tweeted me. 
[02:10:30]  Bobo face-planting off the karaoke stage.  Oh, I heard about that.  I didn't see it.  You haven't seen it yet?  No.  Why would you see that in your own house?  Let's take a look at the.  Let's take a look at the autistic falling face-first off the stage.  Thank God that's online.  I didn't know Bobo fell off the stage.  All right, here's a.  This is pulled from live from the compound.  Yeah, so who's doing the compound show at this point?  It's a good video.  Who's that girl?  And that guy?  Oh, very good. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, yeah, who is that?  Dennis and Brie.  Oh.  Are they doing a compound show?  Yeah, they're doing a compound show.  And who's the headless person?  Who's the headless person?  I don't know.  It's DeRosa?  It looks like DeRosa's body.  Broly is DeRosa.  I reckon your body's so awful, I recognize his nose shoulder.  That's funny, yeah.  You can tell, right?  It's DeRosa.  Oh, that's hilarious.  His head's gone.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the best DeRosa I've ever seen.  That's the most entertaining form of DeRosa.  Look for his kitten tattoo.  It says kitten, right?  Yes, with a period at the end. 
[02:11:30]  That's good.  How about a semicolon on the tattoo?  Kitten with a period.  That was a fool.  That's what a grown man gets.  He says for a tattoo.  Is he trying to work the karaoke machine?  I think he is.  He's typing in the name of a song that he probably wants to sing.  Now, I've seen this video, and I need to know.  You're telling me the stage is only two inches high?  Yeah, the stage is literally, it's molding.  It's a piece of molding, floor molding.  Okay.  Yeah.  Because this is just amazing what happens.  Okay.  Hey, hey, hey, hottie. 
[02:12:00]  Bobo's cousin.  Can I get some drink?  Yeah.  Listen.  Oh, three going after Bobo's cousin in there?  Oh, Jesus.  Could you rewind?  I've got to see that again.  He falls right off the stage.  Listen.  Why does my head get cut off?  He tripped over the mic cord.  Of course he did.  Could you see the mic go down?  Bobo just fell off the fucking stage.  Bobo is a retard, ladies and gentlemen.  Bobo is a retard. 
[02:12:30]  He fell off the stage.  That's Bobo's cousin.  He came over to make sure Bobo was okay.  Oh, my God.  It's a two-inch stage?  It's two inches.  He obviously tripped over the mic cord, because the mic went falling down after him.  Holy shit.  And you didn't know this happened?  No, I heard about it, buddy.  I heard about this.  I didn't.  I think there's video.  Thank God.  The worst of the week.  Countdown.  On the O.P. Anthony channel.  MLB Network Radio is live in New York City for All-Star Week.

The worst of the week countdown. 
[02:17:30]  No!  Continues.  This is what it is, the worst of the week countdown,  where we count down the great moments that happened on this week's Opie and Anthony show.  With me, Sam Roberts, because who else is going to bring you this much joy on the weekend?  Charlie Day was in studio this week, but I don't want to play that for you yet.  First, I'll play David Spade.  I don't know where you know him from.  For me, I'm obsessed with the movie Joe Dirt.  I think that movie is fucking hilarious and underrated.  But, of course, Tommy Boy, Black Sheep, SNL, Dickie Roberts, child superstar, whatever it was. 
[02:18:00]  I don't know.  Most importantly, he's in Grown Ups 2 this weekend, which I hope everybody's going to see.  We didn't quite know what to expect from David Spade, but as it turns out, and we should have known,  he's a fabulous guest and a friend of Colin Quinn.  And any friend of Colin Quinn is a friend of the Opie and Anthony show.  David Spade in studio.  David Spade. 
[02:18:30]  What's up, David?  How you doing, man?  Take a seat right there.  Take a seat.  Pull up the chair.  Is that me?  That's Sam.  Hi.  Hey, how are you?  Sam Roberts over there.  Big fan of Joe Dirt right there.  Sam Roberts.  Huge fan of the Joe Dirt.  Oh, my God.  A little scratchy today.  Yeah, yeah, right?  Yeah, I guess so.  Have you been making the rounds a lot?  Is that us?  I don't know if we should have picked the day after the premiere, but whatever.  Oh, right, a little. 
[02:19:00]  I saw you guys on the red carpet yesterday.  Oh, nine minutes ago.  I got to walk by.  Yeah, nine minutes ago.  See, I saw all you guys being interviewed.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, that's in my neighborhood.  That movie theater is in my neighborhood.  And Shaq was like two feet above everybody as he was being interviewed.  I know, I look like Stuart Little.  They always want him to pick me up or something.  It's so ridiculous.  It is humiliating, right?  Being around bigger men when they want them to do little man things with you.  Just hold him like he's a baby.  It always goes south for me because I don't, I look like the biggest puss, you know. 
[02:19:30]  I'd rather not.  And then when chicks try to do it, it's really bad.  Yeah, that's embarrassing.  The girl in the movie, you didn't see, who didn't see Grown Up 1, everybody?  I did too.  Jimmy did not see.  But it's like Inception.  It's so complicated.  We play it backwards.  This is like, you could probably jump in on this one and figure it all out.  Yeah, yeah.  There's a girl in this one that's super tough and she plays my girlfriend, but she's like 
[02:20:00]  a bodybuilder girl.  And I know on the carpet, they were just starting to whisper, like, pick him up.  Oh, no.  I go, no, no, no, no, no.  They always want those embarrassing shots.  What are they doing?  Yeah, I know.  It's horrible.  Just pick him up.  This will be great.  I heard you guys doing a little Edmund Fitzgerald.  Yeah, yeah, you know.  Well, it rings 29 times.  I love that song because I went to see Gordon Lightfoot.  Those are the kind of concerts.  You did?  Yeah, to get the chicks.  Oh, who said this?  Oh, that's so nice.  Chicks from the Gordon Lightfoot show. 
[02:20:30]  He knows how to tell a story.  Yeah, man.  The only, like, 12-minute song that's really a toe-tapper.  I love it, too.  I think it's...  I told the only time I've ever requested to a radio station was I called into a Light  FM station when I was, like, 14 and requested Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.  You did not do that.  What a little douche.  I was a douche.  Really?  They didn't play it.  Of course they didn't.  But they don't really take requests.  I don't know why that song is so popular.  It's not a happy subject.  No.  It's not a real toe-tapper.  I never knew what was really going on until it was a real song. 
[02:21:00]  I go, oh, brutal.  Yeah, yeah, right?  It's been good to know you.  Yeah, it's good to know you.  Yeah, I go, wait, what's happening?  Are they going home for the night?  Leaving the bar?  I saw him in Los Angeles and went to see him with some chick, and she was like, oh, sweet.  Of course, it couldn't be more of an old man show.  Oh, shit.  This guy, I'm just telling you, you know his stuff.  And so, but I saw him before, and then he shouted me out at Carefree Highway, because 
[02:21:30]  that's in Arizona where I'm from.  Damn.  So I was like, you like that shit, huh?  That's pretty fucking...  The chick was like, no.  No?  Did she know his stuff?  Well, she goes, this one sort of feels familiar.  I think I know.  She probably saw it in a movie or something.  I know.  Maybe.  It's not the panty dropper concert I thought it was.  No.  What's the first concert you remember going to?  Oh, for sure, I remember going to Heart.  Heart, really?  That's not a bad first one.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  Someone asked my first movie in an interview, and I couldn't remember.  Everyone knew their first movie. 
[02:22:00]  Do you know your first movie?  Yeah, it was probably the only movie.  I did one line in Spider-Man.  No, what?  Your first movie you saw.  Not that you did.  Not that you did.  Oh, good.  I remember the first movie I shot.  No, the first movie I ever saw, I can...  I'm going to...  No, it might have been...  Jaws is the first one I remember, I believe, going to, or Star Wars.  It was one of those two.  Probably Jaws.  Oh, yeah, you're right.  Maybe one of those, because Heart was my first concert, I know for sure, but I can't  think of the movie, but Heart was hot, and my brother came, and he brought some, I think  slow gin, if that's something. 
[02:22:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, whatever it was I borrowed from.  Like slow gin fizz.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, and he was sitting next to me.  He got me the tickets, and he goes, they don't want fucking kids here.  And I'm like, what a dick.  I paid him to get the tickets.  All my brothers hated me growing up.  They were like, they don't want freshman hair.  I go, it's a freshman party.  Were you the youngest?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, so you're the one that was like, you're the-  I'm shockingly sort of a pussy, too.  Tag along.  Yeah.  Yeah, you know what?  I got to jump in there, too.  I was the biggest pussy.  And my brother was like, oh, he's getting in trouble, and he was hanging out with his 
[02:23:00]  friends.  And you know, when they started smoking weed and stuff, and I'm ratting him out to my  parents.  Yeah, I was a fucking snitch.  I was a fucking snitch.  I was sure to be around as a kid.  Yeah, I was a snitch.  Oh, my God.  I was the biggest rat.  Terrible.  Why the fuck would you do that?  My brother would steal from my mom.  We were totally broke, because my dad scrammed on us, and we were like four, six, and eight.  Jeez.  So we're just three little kids.  My mom's got two jobs.  She's busting her ass.  She'd come home, and he'd steal her money.  And then she goes, we don't have the rent, no money?  What happened?  And he looked at me, and he goes, I'll fucking kill you. 
[02:23:30]  Holy shit.  And my mom's like, do you know anything?  Am I going crazy?  There's someone sitting there, and I go, I don't know, and he's looking at me all  like, fucking bad shit.  Oh, my God.  And he's like, Mom, shut up.  I don't know where it is.  I'm like, shut up?  Mom?  Oh, my God.  I didn't really appreciate the fact that she had two jobs.  You're the most selfish asshole of the kid.  Did you ever see your dad again?  I bought him a condo.  That's so stupid.  Damn.  You know how that goes?  Pretty nice.  Sorry, I took a bite.  That's right.  We don't care. 
[02:24:00]  Oh, we do it all the time.  You do it?  Yeah, we don't care.  Don't even worry about it.  They get pissed, but we don't care.  My dad took a powder.  Actually, we were in Michigan.  He moved us to Arizona and then left her.  Wow.  Now we don't even know where we are.  Oh, my God.  Fuck.  Don't know anyone.  So he's out skirt chasing.  And then he'd show up once a year and give me a Nerf football for Christmas.  Thought he's my hero again.  Oh, my God.  Thanks, Dad.  Oh, it's two colors.  Just spoil me.  That was like once a year thing.  And then my brother.  Then I started doing okay in stand-up, you know, in Arizona. 
[02:24:30]  But later, she let me move in with him to save money or whatever.  But we're more like buddies, you know.  I was probably 19.  God, this sounds like sick.  She had a one-bedroom with those two twin beds.  This is exactly like my upbringing, by the way.  Yeah.  This is exactly the same thing.  This is why when I wrote Joe Dirt, I'm like, this is all the shit from growing up.  Walking around with a gas can with my shirt off.  And then he started hanging out more if I was doing more shit in town, you know. 
[02:25:00]  Because he'd say he's my dad and he'd get free drinks.  And then my brother started Kate Spade with his wife.  And then he got to say to the girls, oh, Kate Spade is my daughter.  He sort of fudged it a little bit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's his son.  And so he would play all, you know, you don't know David Spade?  Oh, what about Kate Spade?  And he'd find some way to get free drinks.  And so he did that forever.  And then I bought him a car.  And then he complains there's no pinstripes on it.  It's all crazy, you know.  Wow, yeah, yeah. 
[02:25:30]  You got to get the sheepskins.  I want the whole package.  You know when your dad looked like an asshole?  I go, yeah, you're right.  Oh, you're right, Dad.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That power over you.  Yeah, it's so weird.  That sucks.  Then, like Joe Dirt, that movie was,  the first time we wrote it,  it was sort of like a crystal meth guy, you know.  It was sort of that tip,  and then we had to tone it down.  Tone it down, make it a little more.  That's more the real guy you see,  jigging around Arizona.  Like, as a kid, I don't know what's wrong.  I go, what's going on with these guys?  Just the white trash, crystal meth-headed. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah, they're like, this guy's got the flu or something.  Year-round.  No, I was meeting Chris Rock last night.  Oh, is that pictures from the premiere?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, sorry.  It's a brutal summer for trying to get a movie out today.  Yeah.  Sure, yeah.  Why?  Well, because the biggest ones come out right now,  and so we're right in the middle like we were last time.  Last time we were after Toy Story 3,  which was the biggest movie the whole summer.  We couldn't even meet it the second week.  Still made 50-something.  Wow.  I was like, fuck, a duck. 
[02:26:30]  And now we got Despicable Me.  Yeah.  Which is like crazy.  That's a monster.  Oh, did they see this in South Africa?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What if you're just driving down the street and there's a cheetah chasing some antelope or gazelle?  Oh, that's so hard.  And then the thing just jumps right into the SUV.  Oh, it did?  Oh, wow.  Oh, yeah.  It said, fuck that.  Yeah, he's like, thanks, man.  And you see there's a cheetah right on his ass.  Right.  I like the cheetah over here, like, putting the brakes on.  Yeah.  You know, Sandler has, he was just doing a movie in South Africa.  Really?  And he showed on his iPhone, he had a little video of, you know, they take him to all the 
[02:27:00]  wild country safari things.  Like, when I was a kid, you go to the real thing where they, like, walk around.  That stopped quickly, I think, once everyone got mauled.  But he was, they had, like, a cheetah or a panther.  There's all, like, different kinds, whatever.  But it was one of the scary ones.  And he was walking around behind him.  And the guys are going, you know, they're always so calm.  They're like, it's fine.  Give him some water.  And so he sees Sandler, lean over with the lady, get some water like this. 
[02:27:30]  And the cheetah just jumps on him from behind.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  And the lady throws him off.  And Sandler's got a big cut on his back.  And I go, what happened?  He goes, you're not supposed to kneel down.  They told me later, you can't kneel in front of him for some reason.  They think you're trying to attack him.  So, oh, wow.  And I go, it was terrifying.  I go, what'd you think?  He goes, it's like 250 pounds.  It jumped on my back and it knocked me down.  And then they grabbed him and hit him with a stick or something.  And I go, why the fuck are you out there with a cheetah? 
[02:28:00]  Like, it always goes sideways.  Every video is like, along with the lions.  And then his buddy, Jack, the producer, has one with his kids.  And they're in a convertible.  And they're 10 feet from another one, a lion eating like a carcass, you know?  And it's hard to see on the radio, but it's hard to see a lot on the radio.  But he's not supposed to make any noise.  And he brought his kids.  And the kid drops something.  And the thing looks up.  Oh, man.  And stares at him. 
[02:28:30]  And then looks down.  And then the other kid stands up and talks.  And it looks again.  And then starts to get up like this.  And they go, oh, man.  It's a convertible.  Yeah.  First of all, it could catch up.  And then it could just jump in.  Jump right in.  That's great.  Why wouldn't you roll the one fucking, put the top up?  Who has the balls in a convertible to stop and watch a lion eat?  I know.  That's nuts.  Plus, who's got a convertible anyway, man?  What do we got?  What year is this?  And I love the fact they forgot to tell Adam Sandler not to squat.  Like, that's interpreted, I guess, as a fucking, you know, because cats kind of squat down and then pounce on you. 
[02:29:00]  You might want to tell them that ahead of time.  Yeah.  We were just looking at the numbers from the first one.  Holy Jesus Christ.  That's goddamn huge.  I don't know what happened.  That's why I don't think you have anything to worry about.  Well, I do think, yeah, I do think, I don't know if we can beat that Despicable Me, but I think we'll do all right.  And then there's Pacific Rim, which looks kind of cool, you know, that movie.  So, as I was telling you earlier, is that every movie, there's a big one, and then it trickles into the next couple weeks. 
[02:29:30]  So, you're still, like, the heat did well, and that was funny.  And so, they just keep going, and then a new one comes, like, five days later.  And then, so you just got to tread water also.  So, do you just freak out when movies come out?  It's gross.  Are you just sitting there thinking, oh, God, do something?  Well, I don't, there's, it's funny because, you know, press is part of it.  The movie has to be funny and people have to, I go by, like, a poster and a trailer and then I'm either in or out.  I don't care if I saw someone on Ellen.  So, but you have to go out and do it, you know, you do all these things and make the best of it and just hope you sway somebody. 
[02:30:00]  And, but we have about 13 cast members, so.  Yeah, right.  It's literally, like, barraging America.  I know they're, like, fucking, we get it.  You're right, yeah.  Go to the movie.  I got the message.  They're all over the place.  I mean, there's big fucking posters for this, too.  Like, the side of buildings and, like, everywhere you go.  It is absolutely everywhere.  That's a lot of money they're spending ahead of time, huh?  But you're Quinn's buddy.  Is that right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay, because I saw Quinn last night.  He ragged on me on Twitter all day.  Really? 
[02:30:30]  Yeah.  Well, he, um.  He's the worst.  I love him.  I love him.  He's great.  On Twitter, it's hilarious.  He was, he was talking about his nonchalant showbiz day yesterday.  I just saw on the way here, typical night for CQ and it's all the photographers and the press line.  I'm not in this for the ego part of it.  And everyone's like, what the fuck are you talking about?  Yeah, they start bashing him.  He gets bites on it every time.  It's so easy.  He's such a great troll.  No one catches on.  I tell Colin, like, I know what you're doing and it upsets me.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:31:00]  I know what you're doing.  It's like, he's just the greatest at it.  There's the picture right there.  A typical night for CQ.  For CQ.  And he's always got hashtags like, uh.  Did he change his avatar too?  Yeah, he changed it to that photo he's been trying to show everybody.  All right.  Yeah, yeah.  He came in here bragging about it.  It's one that didn't make the post.  He sent it in every week.  Larry, is that him?  Oh, yeah.  What's he doing?  Wow.  That's Imus. 
[02:31:30]  Imus.  He looks like Charlie Brown.  Imus on the board.  He fucking looks good.  Yeah, he looks good.  He cleaned up good.  We don't get to see that version of Colin Quinn.  No, he comes in pretty much in his pajamas.  Yeah, dipping his muffin in tea.  We get like the just woke up Colin.  I think he's an English gentleman.  Showered and shaved.  He was there last night too.  Yeah, everyone was there last night.  Is that even live today or no?  Is that a replay?  I don't think I was.  You never know what Imus anymore.  I think that's live.  Well, there's a bunch of girls in it too that are cute. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah.  When I saw it last night, I was like, oh yeah.  I mean, there's enough guy candy.  I wasn't worried about that part.  Did you actually stay for the film?  I did.  Because a lot of you guys.  I was like, yeah.  Last night.  A lot of you guys, you go, you do the red carpet, you go in the theater.  Yeah, I know.  I've always seen it twice.  And I have my buddy here.  Yeah.  Oh, I thought he's in here.  My buddy from Arizona that I grew up with.  And I brought Chris Farley's brother, Kevin, was here. 
[02:32:30]  And so he came with us and some other, one of my other idiot friends.  And so they'd never seen it.  So I sat back and I sort of wanted to see how it played.  Yeah.  And I've seen it with two test audiences that were great.  And last night when it's all industry, a couple of things don't work the way they used to.  And you go, oh boy.  But overall, it was funny.  And it did great.  We were happy.  And I was like, God, there's so much going on in it.  Because I hadn't seen little tiny tweaks to it.  And Sandler's always trying to add and tighten and brighten and just make sure it's good enough. 
[02:33:00]  And with all those people in it, there's always something going on.  Yeah.  So it worked out great.  So we were all happy.  And now we just fucking hold your breath.  Barrage the United States with that interview.  Now I just go, look at you as a little kid.  I'm probably like 10 years older than everyone in that picture.  That was from my prom.  And where I did not get ready.  You just don't have a picture of you smaller to match up with everybody else?  I have like six pictures of me now.  It's like, you want to see my kid at lunch? 
[02:33:30]  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  And my buddy had 100 pictures of his kid getting pumpkins.  And I go, who the fuck?  What's happening?  Where are those going?  Who gives a shit?  How do you give a shit?  You're with your kid.  Yeah, there's like this huge record of where everybody's lives now.  It's clogging up the internet.  Oh, my God.  I have a rose on the bottom.  I see that.  It's your prom picture.  We cropped the shit out of my date, though.  She was like right next to me. 
[02:34:00]  Damn.  And you didn't fuck her?  No.  Oh.  I didn't fuck anybody.  I wasn't on a show.  I was just some asshole trying to look like Brad Pitt back then.  And then I was totally in love with that chick all year.  And I took her to the prom.  And she's like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I was like, oh, my God, this is it.  And so I got all dolled up, picked her up.  It was about 110 degrees.  And I'm waiting at her door.  And then ding, dong, ding, and then I hear, woo, woo, woo, here's some Van Halen.  I go, I look over. 
[02:34:30]  Some dirty goddamn Camaro pulls up.  Oh, sure.  And her college boyfriend drops her off.  And I'm like, wait a second, what?  They start Frenching.  Come on, what the fuck?  She's sitting there, like, drenched in sweat going, wait a second.  And she's like, comes in in a tennis outfit and goes, oh, my God, is that tonight?  And I go, uh.  And then she goes, no, no, just give me two seconds.  I'm going to take a shower.  Find something to wear.  Find something to wear.  Find something.  She's shopping for months.  Meanwhile, you've been thinking about this forever.  Forever. 
[02:35:00]  Holy.  Yeah, yeah.  What a story.  No, no, I'm still going.  You're still going?  Still going?  Um, yeah.  We're supposed to be at fucking Red Lobster a half hour ago.  You know where she is now?  What?  Do you know where she is?  No, do you know.  I do know I saw her.  You do?  Yeah.  Does she look as good?  Um, not, no, not exactly.  She still looks cute.  But, um, I think she's still married.  She's one of the few that made it through.  Yeah.  Everyone, you know, you see everyone always divorced. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  But sometimes in Arizona, they stick it out longer.  Really?  Because, yeah, like, I've got the guys that married their high school girls, and they're  still together.  So, it's pretty, pretty high together rate, shockingly, because where I'm from, it's like  low.  Yeah, yeah, no shit.  Everyone's like, why don't you just do a two-year marriage and just do that one of those?  I am.  They have a two-year marriage plan, right?  It's like, almost like guaranteed.  Yeah, yeah.  No, just married for a year, then have a kid, and right when the kid's born, you guys break  up. 
[02:36:00]  That's what everyone does.  Or hang in there for another six months, like you're really trying for the kid, and  then just call it quits.  It's probably good, because then the kid doesn't even know what it's like to have two parents  to lose, you know, that whole.  Yeah.  I always wonder, like, because I know friends are like, we're waiting until the kid's 18.  I'm like, when is, so the kid gets what's going on, but when is it good, like, it  doesn't fuck the kid up?  I know a girl who's 27, her parents are getting divorced, and she's so fucking freaked out  about it.  Fucked up about it?  Yeah, and I'm like, try four.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah, you know what?  Age isn't good.  Like fucking 11.  Yeah.  Four to 11.  I don't have any recollection of my dad, like, too.  Being around the house.  I just remember him now going, let's put all our money in a pile and split it.  We don't have any.  See how it goes.  That's the fun of the game.  You don't know what you're going to get.  That's hilarious.  I had to get a job at, like, 13 and put in for, like, groceries and stuff.  For, like, shit, yeah.  Yeah.  Like, I'm paying.  Well, you know, you've got to put in your shit. 
[02:37:00]  And then, meanwhile, you know, I come home from school, and he's sitting there drinking  a tall boy, bud.  How was your day?  How was yours?  Right.  Mine was tall boy.  How yours was.  Of course.  So funny.  Yeah, the big tall boy.  Because then we had a stepdad, and it was, like, so odd.  Because one time, because I was, like, nine, and my mom, mom goes, go call him dad.  It was so gross.  I go, oh, no.  I was like, dad.  He's like, what?  I was so cringed on.  Oh, shit.  Then he gave me a shotgun for my birthday when I was 10. 
[02:37:30]  I had a shotgun and a deer rifle.  And I was like, oh, I wanted to nerf it.  He told you there were toothbrushes.  Oh, shit.  Gave me a shotgun shell reloader.  Nice.  Such a dirt ball.  So we'd go shoot tarantulas and shit.  Was he cool, though?  He was cool.  He was all right?  Oh, shit.  Because there's a lot of horror stories with the stepdaddy.  And he was a doctor.  Oh.  And the phone rang.  I never quite got that he was on call for the emergency room. 
[02:38:00]  And he's like, glug, glug, glug, glug.  He's like, get it.  And I'm like, hello?  Oh, there's been an emergency.  He's like, mother fuck.  So then I'm like, are you going now?  I go, he seems weird because I don't know he's drunk.  Oh, my God.  Back to the office.  My phone is completely functional.  I slipped my knee open once playing baseball.  And they took me in.  And he was working.  I'm like, I don't want this guy.  I know what this guy's all about.  He's all hammered. 
[02:38:30]  I go, oh, boy.  Holy shit.  That's insane.  Did you at least make out with the prom date?  I'm obsessed with this night.  No, it was tough.  And then the next year, I was in love with another chick for the whole year.  This is why I'm all, like, tough now about it, I guess.  Yeah.  So the next year, I get this girl.  And then she, I think, maybe got some boob action.  But that was a mercy boob.  She's like, just grab it and get out of here.  Oh, man.  Did you just have no game whatsoever?  Zero. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah.  And then the one chick I did hook up with was sort of passed out.  She didn't start that way.  And I don't think it's bad.  She was sort of okay at the beginning, but dozed off somewhere in the middle.  Yeah.  And then that didn't slow me down.  But then I saw her working at Circle K a couple years later.  I'm like, hey, man, I wanted to go again.  Yeah, of course.  It's like 10 years later.  Oh, wow.  I'm like, Circle K.  I thought it was the greatest job. 
[02:39:30]  I go, I always go to Circle K.  This is bad.  Is that your first fuck?  Yeah.  Oh, that's great.  That is a good one.  She was pretty hot, too.  And then all my friends go, oh, I used to fuck her.  I go, what?  Oh, man.  That's something you never wanted to hear either.  I just got some, like, pass around.  I don't care.  Who cares?  It was great.  At that point, yeah.  And then college, bleak again.  Another dry spell, huh?  Shit.  It was all a dry spell until, I don't know.  It slowly started.  But you have no game.  Even though I got on a TV show, I still don't know what to do. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah.  They have to really make it easy.  The fuck up thing with back then was, like, you could get laid.  And it was a miracle if you did.  But then it's like, wow, okay, I know what this is like.  And I know I'm not going to get laid again for at least, like, maybe a year.  Yeah.  Maybe an entire year will go by.  And you just don't have those opportunities.  You have no game.  Don't give up on it.  Yeah, yeah.  Don't enjoy this.  Too much.  Too much.  Because...  You're going to be jonesing for a while.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're not going to do that.  The Worst of the Week Countdown on the Opie and Anthony Channel.

You can also follow me on Twitter, at NotSam.  The number one bit this week on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Finally, from Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Charlie Day stops by.  That's right.  Maybe you know him from Horrible Bosses.  I don't know where you know him from.  Point is, he was finally in the Opie and Anthony studio,  and this is what it sounded like when worlds collided. 
[02:41:30]  Number one.  Charlie Day.  Ah, Charlie.  How are you?  Take a seat right there.  We're actually on the air.  We just...  Pleasure, nice to meet you.  We just do a come right in, sit down on the air kind of thing.  That's great.  Yeah.  A lot of people know it's real.  I don't like that whole, you know, come in, sit down during a commercial break,  and then you're like...  Just stare at each other. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah, you like say things that you're like, oh, you should have swept that on the air.  They tell the best stories before they come back.  Like, what'd you do?  Oh, man, I'm tired.  You shit on a hooker.  Oh, and then you're back on the air.  You're like, fuck.  Yeah, it would freeze up.  This way you can come in frozen.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, Idris Elba is in this movie?  Yeah.  Fuck, man.  I'm obsessed with meeting him.  I've not met him yet.  Why?  I love The Wire so much.  Oh, sorry.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's cool. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah.  That's the only reason.  Yeah.  I was very depressed when I found out he was English, just because I was like...  It's so odd, man.  Was that strange?  Yeah, my guy is such a better actor than I am.  Yeah.  You know, I couldn't...  It doesn't go the other way.  I'm not going to go to England and butcher their...  Yeah.  It is humiliating when British actors come...  Like, I didn't know Gary Oldman was British until I heard him interviewed.  Well, he's just...  Yeah.  He's crazy good.  Or Idris.  Who else?  There's so many.  On The Wire.  Yeah, all those guys.  You find out they're all British.  Yeah.  And everyone in Batman fucking... 
[02:43:00]  Who...  Bale and...  Christian Bale, yeah.  Bale, there's another one.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Just like...  He does amazing American accent.  Yeah.  Are we that easy?  Yeah, I guess so.  I guess so.  If you're a great actor, maybe.  Yeah.  You know, it's easy.  I think they just have a more intense acting discipline over there.  It's, you know, like, learn every accent.  Right.  And, you know, where we're just like, hey, you good at fart jokes?  Great.  Yeah, yeah.  Welcome to Hollywood.  Everyone in America does, like, their Beatles version of an English accent. 
[02:43:30]  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Yeah, yeah.  It's just terrible.  Wow.  Pacific Rim.  Have you seen it?  No.  No.  Not yet.  You're going to love it.  I'm waiting.  It looks insane.  I know it's my job to come in here and say you're going to love it, and I kind of wish  I wasn't in the movie, and I'd seen it so I could tell people and they'd actually believe  me.  But, uh...  I like...  I love the movie.  Yeah.  What do you like about it?  If you hate fun, then you might not like the movie.  If you're like, you know, like...  I only like movies like Sophie's Choice.  Oh, boy. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  It looks huge, like a huge movie.  That's the thing about this movie.  It's gigantic.  Yeah.  I would recommend seeing it in IMAX, which is where I saw it for the first time, and then  my mind exploded.  What's it about?  Basically, it's about giant monsters coming out of the ocean and the robots that we've  built to punch them right in the face.  You know, it's like a classic, almost Godzilla-esque...  They're called Kaiju, the monsters of Kaiju. 
[02:44:30]  Oh, so it is like Sophie's Choice.  Okay.  Very much like Sophie's Choice, you know, like, do I keep the baby?  Which child do I keep?  And which one do I punch in the face?  Because I think it's a lizard from space.  But, uh...  Like, it's just like a fun summer blockbuster.  The movie's awesome.  I see you're happy with it.  When you watch something, do you, like, critique yourself, like, ah, fuck, I hate this?  Or are you kind of comfortable and enjoy watching yourself work?  You know what?  I've been very lucky to have done so few things that I haven't done one yet that I've been,  like, you know, like, Horrible Bosses was great. 
[02:45:00]  So watching that, I was like, oh, this is fun.  This is good.  I love sunny.  It's always sunny in Philadelphia.  And, uh...  But earlier on, when I started out, you know, it was a lot of, like, oh, I hate this crap.  And, uh, I'm reading that you've...  Wait, wait, can we ask you for one?  Yeah.  One that I hated?  Yeah, one example of.  We love hearing those.  Oh, man.  Let me, uh...  Maybe it's a commercial or...  Yeah, I did tons of shitty commercials.  Uh, there's, like, one going around the internet right now that I talked about on a talk show, 
[02:45:30]  which is Thomas' Bagel commercials.  Really bad.  Um, but, like, what else?  I love digging those up, man.  Oh, man, yeah.  Hey, look at this guy.  He looked like an idiot.  It's like, they always get, like, if you're a young actor and you need to eat,  they always got that on you.  Yeah.  It's like, you gotta do a couple bad gigs.  Um, man, what did I do?  Like, I was, like, the mailroom kid and, like, the Mary Tyler Moore special.  Like, just, like, a lot of, uh, schlocky little one-liners.  That's what I was gonna ask you about.  Did you work...  Did you have scenes with, uh, her or Valerie Harper? 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  You know, there's this funny audition where, uh, like, she looks at herself in the mirror  and I have one line.  It was, like, looking fine.  And I sort of said it sarcastically in my audition.  Like, hey, you don't have to keep checking yourself out.  Like, you look okay.  And then I get down to set and they're like, all right, this is Mary Tyler Moore.  You can't be sarcastic.  You really have to compliment her that she looks very good.  Oh, God.  So, like, looking fine turned into, like, looking fine.  Which is a very different thing than what I'd expected. 
[02:46:30]  Oh, no.  You want the fun Mary Richards, but you get the one from fucking, uh...  From ordinary people.  Ordinary people.  Yeah, the ice queen.  Brown socks to the son's funeral.  A little bit.  She's very sweet to me, though.  It was very nice.  Yeah.  It was, like, for her first gig.  And, uh, you know, it made me feel like I belonged there.  How was Valerie Harper?  She's still alive, right?  Didn't see her.  Didn't return any of my phone calls.  Damn it.  None of my fan letters.  Of course, I wasn't really a fan.  I gotta be honest.  It's like, that's all before my time.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  I was kind of there being like, I don't give a shit about these people. 
[02:47:00]  That's a job.  Yeah, this is a gig.  They probably sensed it, too.  Like, every young actor's probably so in awe of them.  And then you just didn't give a fuck about them.  Yeah, I think there's like a mid-70s, 80s cutoff for their major families.  Yeah.  What did you grow up, like, enjoying and watching on TV?  Let's see.  I mean, I'm, you know, I was, I'm born in 76, but probably didn't really pay attention  to things until 85.  So, you know, like, you know, E.T. and, uh... 
[02:47:30]  Back to the Future.  Yeah, Back to the Future, Star Wars.  That's my whole thing.  Yeah, what about, like, TV shows?  Because they were pretty cheesy.  You know what I love?  It was Night Court.  Yeah, yeah.  You guys watch Night Court?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It was my favorite.  I don't know, because it took place at night.  It was like, I felt like, you know, like, after when I was supposed to go to sleep.  And I'm like, oh, this is what adults are doing at night.  This is very interesting.  Going to court.  They're all going to court.  You know, and sitting on whoopee cushions.  The judge is always a card, isn't he? 
[02:48:00]  Yeah, he's doing magic tricks up there.  Never seen that.  Markie Post is just getting fucking beatings and everything she does.  She's in her lifetime movies.  Yeah, that's all she does is play, like, the abused woman nowadays.  I know.  She came in and auditioned for us for a part in It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.  Yeah?  And, you know, it's one of those things where you're like, oh, my God, that's Markie Post.  You know, we want to cast her because, you know, we all love Night Court.  But, like, she was, like, very wrong for the role.  Oh, right, yeah.  Like, it's really tough, like, to see those sort of actors come through. 
[02:48:30]  Was she bad?  Well, I can say she's bad if she's wrong.  She wasn't bad.  It was just like, yeah, that this woman was supposed to be really, I guess we didn't picture  her as beat up as apparently she's getting.  Right.  She looked very good.  She looked very good.  We found looking fine.  We got to.  We found looking fine.  Yeah, we got to.  Get out of here.  Is this translation on the radio?  It's quick.  Sure.  It's Mary Tyler Moore in the office.  There's Charlie Day. 
[02:49:00]  Excuse me.  I'm looking for Jonas Seemeyer.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wow.  You should be right up those stairs up there.  Oh, I forgot I had another line.  Yeah, look at that.  Another line.  Two lines.  Looking fine.  Oh.  That was great.  Looking fine.  I'm like checking her out.  That's a little awkward.  Yeah, you know, what the?  That is awkward.  You gave her a wink, too, Charlie. 
[02:49:30]  I gave her a wink.  And now she's all happy.  She's got a little pep in her step.  I don't know.  Thanks to you.  That seemed a little weird, maternalistic thing.  I know.  Weird, like mother, son.  It's a little weird.  Yeah, you were a little too young to be.  But maybe I'm going to bang her.  Right, right.  I don't know what's going on in that show.  That's great.  Make Mary eat your ass in the mailroom.  Oh, no, I would have done it.  I needed, you know, I needed money.  I needed money.  I was like, oh, it's in the script.  It's on NBC. 
[02:50:00]  It's a big part.  That's a great first role, though, man.  He's going to see him at Mary Tyler Moore.  Even if it's just that, it's fucking great.  It was a good gig, yeah.  It's pretty impressive.  Big time.  With Sonny in Philadelphia, were you surprised with how much freedom you get for content?  No, not really.  Because that was sort of the deal about doing it at FX, which was like, here's a place where  they'll pay you nothing but they'll let you do whatever you want, you know? 
[02:50:30]  Right.  And just to get the chance to...  It's a great show.  Oh, thanks, man.  Oh, my God.  It's one of the best.  Yeah, we're doing season nine right now.  I know.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Amazing.  How is it working with DeVito?  He's great.  Yeah, obviously.  And I can barely keep up with the guy.  He's a maniac.  Yeah.  He likes his fun and he can party and he never sleeps.  But he's a really good dude.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It really is. 
[02:51:00]  There's quite a difference watching a show where you get some real language, you know,  real situation.  It takes you out of it when you know they'd have said something a little more harsh and  they pull back on network TV like that.  I don't know how those shows can compete in this day and age where you can find anything  you want sort of tailor-made to you and you're right.  It's like, how do you pull your punches?  It takes you right out of it when it's like, nah, you wouldn't have backed off like that  or said something rude.  I like the believable dialogue in a sitcom, though, like off the funny look and then the 
[02:51:30]  crowd explodes with laughter.  I mean, that's it.  That's what you're doing.  That's what gets you.  Oh, every time it gets me.  Sure.  And look, you're in the majority, I think.  Yes.  I don't feel bad.  I don't feel bad.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Yeah.  All I would do if I was working with Danny DeVito is do fucking Cuckoo's Nest lines.  That's all I would do is talk about what's going on.  Which is odd because most people would think Taxi.  I love Taxi, too.  It's a fucking masterpiece.  But Cuckoo's Nest is here.  What lines would you do?  Just, I bet a nickel. 
[02:52:00]  I bet a dime.  That's all I'd say.  I bet he'd love that.  Oh, he would never get old.  Constantly.  His lines.  Oh, yeah.  Only his.  Yeah, good.  There's someone that's worked forever.  Yeah.  I know.  Like, he's never.  Every year, you could look at his body of work.  Yeah.  Over the year.  And the guy that I'm sure everyone was like, you want to be an actor?  Right.  Yeah, exactly.  All right.  You're two feet tall and a little pudgy.  A little abrasive.  A little lacking the hair.  He was great in Ruthless People. 
[02:52:30]  You ever seen Ruthless People?  Yeah.  He was like, I dare you to kill her.  When he struck his wife.  Like, Bette Midler, I think it was.  Yeah.  Was kidnapped.  War of the Roses, too.  Yeah, he directed War of the Roses, too.  That's the thing.  Amazing.  He was a smart guy.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  Look at us blowing smoke up his ass right there.  Yeah.  Well, it's nice.  It's encouraging.  He's not like a typical leading man.  Do you want to crap all over him?  Yeah, yeah.  Let's just shit on someone.  We need to.  Make ourselves feel better.  He really phoned it in.  Could have been a much better penguin. 
[02:53:00]  Were you acting in front of a green screen a lot?  No, that was the awesome thing about this movie.  How would they pull that?  They actually built giant robots.  No, they didn't build giant robots.  But they're so giant that you're actually not in the scenes with them.  Right, yeah.  But any scene that I was in, Guillermo is this crazy director.  And he's a brilliant guy.  He did Pan's Labyrinth and won copious awards.  So he built these gigantic sets.  Things were always on fire. 
[02:53:30]  There were chickens and dogs running through the streets.  Things were caving in.  It was always raining.  Things would explode.  There were practical props and little creatures that were supposed to be crawling on the big creatures that he built.  Tiny little actual creatures.  All right, so you're not staring at a tennis ball hanging from a wire.  No, never.  It was never like that.  It was pretty great.  And then you see the movie and then all the CGI, which they really, you know, they did a great job with it when you see it, combined with those giant sets. 
[02:54:00]  And it's the most massive thing.  Is the CGI as good as Sharknado?  Sharknado on sci-fi?  Tonight?  No.  No, but it's close.  Sharknado.  Explain this to me.  It's a sci-fi original.  You know how they've been pumping out these movies?  Where they get people from, like, the 80s or 90s, a few stars, and throw them in these movies.  Here's the plot.  Storms in the Pacific have whipped up water spouts and sucked up a bunch of sharks. 
[02:54:30]  A lot of sharks.  And when they go over land, they fling thousands of sharks out at people.  And they proceed to, you know, bite people.  Very similar plots.  Yes.  Very similar.  Exactly.  All right.  All right.  I think a little bit more money went into this one, I'm going to guess.  It's so ridiculous.  Tara Reid's in it.  Tara Reid.  Mary Tyler Moore, Valerie Harper.  Tara Reid.  Good.  Tara Reid.  She's still working.  And the father from Home Alone.  Home Alone. 
[02:55:00]  Now, who is that?  Exactly.  I just know him as the father from Home Alone.  The father from Home Alone.  We don't know his name.  You want to see the trailer real fast?  Oh, it's fantastic.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Can we turn you on to something today, please?  This is great.  Hurricane David is poised to be the first hurricane.  Storm.  That's what's driven them all up north.  I've never seen so many up north.  There he is.  I'm the wrong guy.  Look at this.  It's really even raining.  It's flooding.  Not the plumbing.  The ocean.  You need to go home.  I'm not going in.  I'm from 90210.  Shark right through the window.  These people know. 
[02:55:30]  I'm going to take a shot.  Sharknado.  Forgado is heading towards the airport.  We need to destroy it before it catches us.  Sharks are falling on people.  Yeah.  Watch out!  Look out, the shark's climbing the rope.  Shark's throwing down on them.  I'm not kidding.  Yeah.  This is ridiculous.  It's actually based on a true story.  Too many of them.  We're going to need a big time.  Guys, I think I'm in here for the order to run.  I think this is what America needs. 
[02:56:00]  Exactly, right?  You've got to see the Ferris wheel.  Oh, the Ferris wheel.  Rolling after people.  Look at that special effects there, Charlie Day.  Can you compete with that?  Right.  Can you compete with that shit?  Yes.  But the amazing thing is, there was no CGI there.  They actually killed 1,500 sharks.  That's amazing.  That's tough to do in the state.  Yeah.  You're all the damn liberals.  You know what's funny?  That dad from Home Alone, I used to wait tables here in New York when I was starting out. 
[02:56:30]  You know, like before I was getting those sweet Mary Tyler Moore gigs.  Yeah.  And I used to wait on that guy.  Really?  Yeah, totally.  At the Cornelia Street Cafe, like down in Greenwich Village.  And he was okay.  He was not a dick.  Oh, okay.  But who's on top and who's on bottom now?  My God, I was just thinking that.  It's like, right?  Who's in Pacific Rim and who's in Sharknado?  Yeah.  You know, what's going to happen is that I'm going to be in Sharknado 5 one day. 
[02:57:00]  You know what I mean?  And then some kid's going to be in here.  Some young upstart.  Yeah.  One of these interns in the hallway.  We checked this out.  Remember when that guy was in Pacific Rim?  Look at him.  Sharknado 5.  Sharknado 5, man.  The heretic.  Everyone's talking about Sharknado.  It's on tonight.  So we watch that tonight, then we go and check out Pacific Rim.  Are you guys out now or do you come out tomorrow?  We come out tonight.  Oh, you do tonight.  Yeah.  What time?  I think like 7.  Everyone's doing that.  Everyone's doing that.  Yeah, they say fuck the Fridays. 
[02:57:30]  Let's start this whole thing on.  People can't wait.  Why wait?  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think once people are excited, let them in.  Let them see it.  I like to see it in IMAX if it's playing in IMAX.  Definitely.  You have to see it in IMAX.  There are movies that you just have to see in IMAX, and that's one of them.  It's so big.  You just want that immersion feeling like you're in it.  Yeah, watching it made me feel like when I saw, say, Jurassic Park for the first time.  Oh, man, yeah.  And I wish, I don't think IMAXs were even around.  Can you imagine? 
[02:58:00]  But I think I went back like two nights in a row to see Jurassic Park, like three times  in a row.  I was just blown away.  I saw the 3D version recently.  Oh, really?  They re-released it in 3D, because there was somebody who I was kind of hoping to put my  penis in, and that's what she wanted to see.  And I agreed.  It sounds like a great idea.  And it just isn't made for 3D.  It's okay.  It was better done than it probably, I thought it would be.  It's not the sexiest movie in the world, too.  Not at all.  To bring a girl, too.  No.  Yeah.  You know, you got the Jeff Goldblum thing. 
[02:58:30]  People getting eaten by velociraptors.  Yeah, yeah, getting eaten.  Although the thing sneezes on them.  I'm like, huh?  You know, Jimmy, you want a little of this?  But did it work?  No.  Oh.  No.  Oh, boy.  No.  What happened?  Did you blow it?  No.  She wasn't meant to be.  That's a shame.  She wasn't attracted to me.  That's sad.  Why would she be?  Oh, Jimmy.  But anyway, I saw that, and I wouldn't recommend...  That was sad, man.  Wasn't it just sad?  Don't say, why would she be?  That's okay.  Oh, we hear that every day. 
[02:59:00]  Tell us that's like nothing.  He's good.  Look at him.  He certainly don't want to go to coffee with him or something.  He just wants to take him to lunch.  And they won't even do that.  It's a nice girl to lunch.  That's it.  That's all you want.  That's all I want.  A little lunch.  Hey, man.  Take her to Pacific Rim.  That will get you laid.  Yeah, see?  That will get you laid.  It probably would, because a girl enjoys a big movie like that.  And I would fucking name drop.  You'll do something.  I go, it's funny.  When he told me when he did that.  Will you talk to him?  Yeah.  You can say that we're best friends.  Yeah.  Best friends. 
[02:59:30]  I'll do nothing for you.  No.  All right.  That's the best you got from us.  I mean, that's the best we have from the past week.

[03:04:00]  Audio entertainment courtesy of the people you hear and hear about on the OPNV show.  This is Jim Florentine's podcast, Comedy Metal Midgets.  Yes, it's the Jim Florentine Comedy Metal Midgets podcast.  And thank you for the nice feedback for the last couple of weeks of the podcast.  Trying to keep the anger and rage going.  I think I got a good one this week.  This is about DJ weddings, the DJs that work, the weddings, and also just weddings in general, how awful they are, and drama-filled, and all that other corny bullshit and superstitions and all that crap. 
[03:04:30]  That is what this one will be about.  And I needed some ideas, just in general, in case I missed something.  I put it out on Facebook and Twitter.  Hey, you guys, what annoys you about DJs at weddings and this and that?  So you guys really helped me give me some ideas.  So thank you once again.  Always helps when I have that going on. 
[03:05:00]  Before we even get started, I got a show on Ozzy's Boneyard on Sirius Satellite Radio, Sirius XM.  It's Channel 38, if you have Sirius.  I do it every Thursday from 5 to 7 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.  It's a two-hour show.  And then it replays a bunch of times during the week.  If you don't catch it on Thursday, it's on Saturdays from 1 to 3 in the afternoon.  It's all Eastern Standard.  Sunday, 9 to 11 p.m.  And then Tuesday, 10 a.m. to noon.  And it's also on, if you have Sirius XM On Demand, you can hear all the shows On Demand. 
[03:05:30]  So check it out.  People are digging it.  I play my own songs.  It's awesome.  I'm a big metalhead.  And it's great to just pick up the shit that I want to hear.  And a lot of people notice it.  I don't play any of the hits.  Just like getting back to the wedding DJs by playing all the hits.  All right?  Stop it.  All right?  There's no reason to have Celebration ever played at a wedding again.  Nobody gives a shit.  That song's fucking old.  It's stale. 
[03:06:00]  We're going to start to...  As soon as dinner's over, we're going to start the dancing.  Really?  Is that what it is?  Yeah.  Let's have everybody have dinner first.  And then we'll get everybody on the dance floor.  That's how it should work.  And we'll start it off with either Celebration or We Are Family.  Yeah.  Because you get it.  Because there's a bunch of families here.  And like two families that's together now.  It's the bride and the groom's family.  Now they're like one big family.  So do you see?  You see how We Are Family?  Yeah. 
[03:06:30]  That song stinks.  It's the line dance.  Sweet Caroline.  Brutal.  All right?  A bunch of drunk.  Sweet Caroline.  Da, da, da.  No reason for that song.  Overplayed.  No one has fun singing it.  It's just like, ugh.  You hear that, like, oh, great.  Let me watch all the assholes.  Make more of an asshole of themselves.  It's Sweet Caroline.  Now let's get all the guys who put your arms around each other.  And we'll all sing it. 
[03:07:00]  Because remember we did that when we were kids.  Remember in our early 20s, we used to do that at parties.  And now we're in our mid-30s.  Yeah.  And we don't get together that much anymore.  We just don't, you know, everyone's busy.  Our lives have changed.  But whenever this song comes on, it reminds us.  We were in college.  And we put our arms around each other.  And we just sang Sweet Caroline when we were drunk.  Wow.  Sounds like you had a fucking blast at parties.  Yeah.  Sounds like a great.  Wow.  I wish I went to college with you. 
[03:07:30]  That's the highlight.  Yeah, whenever that came on, no matter what we were doing.  Yeah, if we're in the middle of each sucking each other's dicks, we stopped and we sang  Sweet Caroline.  And then when it's over, we went right back to sucking each other's dicks.  That's what we did.  But we were in college.  So it didn't really matter.  We were just experimenting.  Ugh.  Ugh.  How fucking corny.  Hot, hot, hot.  Never be played again.  You Shook Me All Night Long by ACDC.  You ruined that song. 
[03:08:00]  These fucking DJs at weddings ruined that song.  They have to play it every time.  Let me get a little rock set in now.  We're going to play a little old-time rock and roll.  You Shook Me All Night Long.  And maybe Welcome to the Jungle.  That's a little crazy.  It might be a little heavy for the people to listen to.  But I'm going to put that.  That's my rock set.  Go fuck yourself.  That's my rock set.  What I Like About You by the Romantics, that song was never good.  It always stunk.  Don't ever play that. 
[03:08:30]  You get the goofy white guy in the dance floor trying to dance by himself.  He puts his tie around his head like a headband.  Oh, he's the crazy one.  Oh, watch out, Johnny.  He's wild.  Look, there he goes again.  He's got his tie like a headband.  That's crazy.  You mean he took his tie off?  That means he's really loose.  Because a lot of other assholes have their tuxes and their suit and ties on.  No more suits at weddings, all right?  No more tuxes. 
[03:09:00]  Stop making people buy fucking tuxes or rent tuxes for $150 at least when you wear the thing once.  Stop making fucking white guys sweat in fucking their bad suits.  And they have to wear a tie and they can't even unbutton the top button because their chick won't let them.  Come on.  Everybody's got to have a button.  Don't look like a slob.  For me, please.  All right?  Stop it.  Oh, you look so good in the tux.  Anybody looks good in the tux.  I don't want to hear that ever again.  You look great in the tux. 
[03:09:30]  Rocky Dennis, the kid from the movie Mask, would look good in the tux.  He's a fucking half on a scale of 1 to 10.  He'd be a 4 in a tux.  Okay?  Anybody.  Oh, look at the little kid in the tux.  Look how cute he is.  The fucking kid would look cute with anything on.  He's a little kid.  No reason to have a little kid rent the tux.  More money down the drain.  Yeah, they did a little bridal girl and whatever the fuck.  Ring there.  No kids at weddings. 
[03:10:00]  All right?  They ruin it.  They're fucking cock blockers.  They're running around on a dance floor.  Corny shit comes on.  They're in the way.  People want to dance.  Get them out of there.  Adults only.  There's enough shit for kids everywhere.  Can you have one day without them around?  Get babysitters.  Fucking do whatever you got to do.  No kids at weddings.  They stink.  They're overrated.  And it's not for them.  There's going to be some drinking done.  Maybe banging a fucking bridesmaid in the bathroom.  A lot of fucking shit going down.  We don't need any kids in the way. 
[03:10:30]  I got my kids here.  They're going to leave right after the dinner.  No, they're not.  Get them out of there now.  You already dropped the grand on the wedding.  Drop another fucking hundred on a babysitter.  What a joke.  These frigging weddings.  People got to spend.  Yeah.  Oh, great.  It's at least a grand if you want to take your chick to a wedding.  That's minimum.  If you're not in the wedding party, it's going to be about a grand.  A hotel.  You know, your chick's always got to buy a new dress. 
[03:11:00]  I need a new dress for the wedding.  No, you know.  Well, we just went to my boss's like three months ago.  Just wear that one.  No, but I already wore that.  Yeah, so you can't wear a dress twice.  Yeah, but I already wore that.  You'd be like, yeah, but, you know, everyone at my boss's wedding,  there's actually going to be nobody that was at my boss's wedding at this wedding,  so nobody's going to know.  So why don't you wear it?  I'm not going to say anything.  I won't tell anyone.  Yeah, but I know. 
[03:11:30]  Really?  All right.  Well, you can't keep a secret to yourself?  I don't know.  You know.  I know.  We had anal last night.  You're going to go around telling everybody or just going to go, I know.  You know.  You're not going to tell everyone.  I'm not going to say a word.  I might tell my friends in the bathroom.  But I know.  I wore it already.  Great.  Why don't you just return it after you wore it the first time then?  So your chick has to get a new dress.  And the shoes, you know, it's summer.  I've got to wear summer shoes. 
[03:12:00]  I have one suit.  I had the suit for like eight years.  It wouldn't fit me anymore.  So, my God, I'd get another one.  So I walked in and I told the woman, all right, this is the deal.  This is the suit I want.  Before you even start selling me shit because I don't care.  I never want to wear.  I wear a suit maybe once every three years.  I want a suit where I can wear it in July and I can wear it in February.  I can wear it in a snowstorm and I can wear it in a heat wave. 
[03:12:30]  Give me that fucking color suit.  I don't want to hear shit.  That's not a summer suit and you're going to look weird.  I don't want to hear it.  So now I got a suit I can wear year round that I've wore five times in the last four years I've had it and I haven't washed it once.  Last wedding I went to, I found a roll in it from the wedding before, a year before, and I ate it.  Stop making people, but this fucking bride, I got to get the bridesmaids dresses. 
[03:13:00]  All right.  I know this is hacky.  It's been done a million times, but they're fucking awful.  It's funny how women spend about 30% of their lives bitching about other women's outfits on Facebook, on Twitter, in their fucking conversations, in their texts.  You see what she's wearing?  If I was Scarlett Johansson, I had her money.  I wouldn't wear that.  I don't like that dress.  Did you like it?  Could you see Kim Kardashian's dress?  I was watching the award show. 
[03:13:30]  What was that?  Do you spend 30% of their lives ripping other women apart about their outfits and dresses?  And then when it's their time to get married, they fucking pick out the worst dresses that no one will ever wear again except for at that wedding.  Really?  So all that shit, all that bad-mouthing didn't take effect because you just picked out the worst dresses where every woman at the wedding is going to go.  And in the wedding party, all the bridesmaids and everybody at the event is going to go, oh, my God, those dresses are awful. 
[03:14:00]  Wow.  That's fucking, that's, how much did they pay for that?  $500 to $400 for that?  Wow.  That's bad.  Yeah, I mean, I don't understand that color.  That's what's going on behind your back when you were ripping everybody else apart.  Pick out a fucking dress where it goes, hey, you know what?  Maybe they can wear this again somewhere.  How about doing that?  I don't want to be at your wedding.  I don't want to be in your wedding party. 
[03:14:30]  Okay?  Stop asking me.  I don't get it anymore.  Like I said, my friends are married.  They're all married pretty much now and divorced.  So if they get remarried, they don't have a big fucking shindig like they did the first time.  I don't want to be in your wedding party.  I don't want to rent the tux.  I don't like wearing a fucking bow tie.  I hate cummerbunds.  You got to get the cummerbund.  I remember going to get measured.  I'm like, all right, I'm good.  No, you got to put the cummerbund.  I'm not wearing that.  I'm not trying to hide a gut.  All right?  It's not a fucking workout belt. 
[03:15:00]  You got to put the cummerbund.  It's part of the outfit.  You want to get a hat and cane?  No.  No, I don't want to get a hat and cane.  Yeah, but everybody else in the wedding party is getting a hat and cane.  Yeah, good for them.  I don't give a fuck.  If I got a cane, I'm just going to fucking wrap it around the groom's neck for making me get this cane.  That's what I'm going to do with a cane.  You want to wear sunglasses when you walk in to the reception because it's kind of fun.  You know, everybody will laugh.  That's not fun.  Never has been fun.  When I see that, I'm like, what an asshole. 
[03:15:30]  That's what everybody's thinking.  Nobody's going, oh.  They got like the men in black glasses on, isn't that?  See, you remember that movie that came out 20 years ago that fucking stunk?  Will Smith stinks.  You remember that?  They all came out in the men in black glasses and maybe they'll do a little men in black dance.  Oh, I see they're doing the men in black dance with their glasses on.  This is already fun wedding.  It fucking stinks.  And I wish somebody fucking dropped a pipe bomb off up front. 
[03:16:00]  And set the timer right when they were walking out with their fucking black sunglasses on.  Yeah.  I hate that rehearsed when the wedding party rehearses a little dance when they come out.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you see what they did?  Oh, what's the next one going to do?  Oh, I don't know.  This is going to be crazy.  The first guy, he put his arms up and the other girl like shook her ass and put her arms low.  What's the next people going to do?  Yuck. 
[03:16:30]  Yuck.  Is that what you did?  Is that what you prepared?  Yeah, I'm going to do this and then you do that.  Stinks.  The weddings I went to, they were fun.  You know why?  Because we made them fun.  One wedding we went to, we had a food fight.  We just started fucking throwing food.  Dude, that's a fun wedding to me.  I threw like a meatball at my friend that was sitting at the head table and hit my girlfriend's, my friend's girlfriend right in her white dress, fucking splattered all over a dress. 
[03:17:00]  Thirty-five, no, it was actually about an hour and a half into the wedding part, into the wedding.  She had a huge fucking meatball stained dress because I threw a meatball across the room.  That's fun.  When my brother got married, I was the best man.  Right on the altar when I was supposed to give him the ring, I pulled out a stink bomb, a glass tube, a stink bomb and handed it to him.  That's fun. 
[03:17:30]  His fucking wife still doesn't talk to me to this day.  Disgusted.  A stink bomb is funny.  Then he got me back at my wedding.  He gave me a frigging used bottle cap.  He pulled that out.  Nice.  Exactly.  Perfect.  I was the best man.  His best man speech, I roasted him for frigging 15 minutes.  I ripped him apart.  That's fun.  Instead of, hey, you guys, I knew when you met,  your wife, you two were the one. 
[03:18:00]  You know, happy memories.  And I hope everything, right.  Stinks.  Everybody put the glasses up for Bill and Nary.  Can everybody raise their glasses, please?  Bill, when I first met you, I didn't think you were ever the marrying type.  You were a wild man.  We had some fun times, didn't we?  Let's not get into that.  We won't get into that here because we've got a lot of people here. 
[03:18:30]  But let's just say, you know, we had our fun, didn't we?  Yes.  Yes.  Singing Sweet Caroline.  Drunk in college is fun.  Is that what you call it?  Yeah, we had our fun.  Really?  Yeah, I won't get into it here because it's a little crazy.  One time we hooked up these two chicks at the bar and we brought them back to our dorm.  We had sex with them.  But that's nuts.  But I never thought you were going to be the marrying type.  But when I saw that day when you met Mary and your eyes lit up, I knew she was the one for you. 
[03:19:00]  Oh, yuck.  That stinks.  That's what you came up with?  The guy told you a year and a half ago you were the best man and that's what you came up with?  Right there, I just take the mic away and go, dude, that fucking sucks.  What corny romantic comedy did you get that out of?  Oh, my God.  Ugh.  Awful. 
[03:19:30]  Oh, just mushy.  It's some mushy stuff.  Fucking assholes.  The first time I met her, I knew.  Yeah, we're going to write our wedding vows.  That's fun, isn't it?  These fucking assholes now.  We're going to write our own vows.  Did you write your own?  Yeah, we wrote our own vows.  Wait till you hear them.  Yeah, I wonder what that is going to be.  Is that going to be any different?  What's your wedding vows?  Well, when I first saw you, I knew you were the one. 
[03:20:00]  Right there, I'm like, I'm going to marry that girl.  No, you didn't.  That's not the first thing.  When you saw her, you go, who's that chick with the big tits?  Holy shit.  Are those real?  That's what you were thinking.  You weren't thinking, I'm going to marry her.  Absolutely not.  You're full of shit.  No guy has ever did that.  Go, I want to marry her.  You went over there and you go, hey, you got a boyfriend?  Who are you here with?  No, I'm single now.  That's what you thought right off the bat.  I got to see if that chick's got a boyfriend. 
[03:20:30]  Look at that fucking rack.  At first, I knew.  No, you didn't.  You didn't know because you're fucking four years later.  You would have married her right there in a spot.  Why did it take you five years with her pressuring you going, you know, if we don't get engaged,  I'm going to move on.  It's just I feel like I'm wasting my time in this relationship.  So she wasn't the one.  You fucking ran out of time and gifts and you had no other choice but to marry her because  you don't want to lose her because she's way harder than you.  So just fucking be honest in your wedding vows. 
[03:21:00]  We wrote our own vows.  Yeah.  I just say, hey, honey, you know, we're here today because you fucking pressured the shit  out of me.  All right.  I took you to Cancun on a big vacation for a week.  And when your birthday came up after that for, you know, I had I couldn't top that.  I couldn't get you a sweater from Macy's.  So I got you to ring because you kept fucking bitching and dropping hints along the way.  Do you want to marry me?  That's that's the wedding vow. 
[03:21:30]  Yeah, we wrote our own vows.  This is going to be fun.  I don't want to be there.  I don't want to be at the wedding.  I just want to go to reception, especially the Catholic weddings.  They're a friggin hour and a half long.  I don't get to sit through a mass.  I'm not sitting through it.  OK, I'm hung over.  It's fucking hot.  They didn't put the AC on in the church.  I don't go to church anymore.  I don't want to sit there for a whole ceremony.  All right.  It's all bullshit.  And then you got everybody going up there receiving communion.  Communion is mostly you receive it when if you have a clean slate and no sins, you 
[03:22:00]  have to go into confession, confess all your sins.  Then you go receive communion because you're forgiven.  OK, if you have any sins, you don't go up to communion.  That's the way it works in the Catholic religion.  You got the guy.  Then all of a sudden at a wedding, you got the friggin 70, 80 percent of people walking  up there.  I haven't been in church in fucking 10 years.  You know, when you have to go to church, that's part of it.  If you don't, that's part of like being having a sin where you don't go every week.  So you're not supposed to go up there.  Yeah, I see a guy in there just fucking cheated on his wife the night before at the bachelor 
[03:22:30]  party.  A stripper gave him a blowjob and he's online getting communion.  Yeah.  OK.  Yeah.  This is great.  I think they just do it because the fucking service is so long to hungry.  All right.  Give me that fucking white piece of toast or whatever the hell I give the Yost, the host,  the Yost, whatever.  Stop with that.  That's selfish.  All right.  Nobody wants to be in a church for an hour and 15 minutes sitting through it.  They're bored.  They're like, this sucks.  I got to stand.  I got to sit.  I got to kneel.  I don't know what this shit is anymore. 
[03:23:00]  I haven't done it since I was a kid.  My wedding a year ago, I said to the woman, how long is the service?  Well, how long you want it to be?  I go, no more than 10 minutes.  She goes, I could do it in 12.  I go, all right, you're fucking hired.  12 minutes in and out.  I think it was even less than that when it came down to it.  Just fucking get right to it.  Hey, you guys like each other, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You want to get married?  Yeah, okay.  All right.  Hey, you say yes?  Yeah, you say yes.  Give it a fucking ring.  Here's my ring.  Here's your ring.  Okay, good.  We're in. 
[03:23:30]  Let's fucking start drinking.  That's the way it should be.  Don't make everybody sit for fucking hours.  I did the ceremony.  It was really nice.  No, it wasn't.  They're on the altar.  It's the same shit for years.  Everybody's up there on the altar.  Do you take to see the wife?  Yeah.  Do you take?  Yes, I do.  You may kiss the bride.  Oh, and everyone claps.  And then you walk out.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right?  It wasn't nice.  It's the same shit.  Fucking flowers on the altar.  You know, a priest doing it or whatever. 
[03:24:00]  And then maybe a little frigging bridesmaid goes up and reads from the fucking book of whatever.  Nothing nice about that.  Same shit's been going on for years.  I thought the ceremony was really nice.  No, you didn't.  You're just fucking talking out your ass.  You didn't.  You couldn't wait to get out of there.  You're like, ugh.  God, this is brutal.  I just want to fucking go eat.  That's what you're thinking the whole time.  You didn't think it was nice.  You know, these fucking selfish, it's my day. 
[03:24:30]  No, it's not.  You're a fucking ungrateful cunt is what you are.  To call it your day.  It's not your day.  It's never been your day.  You just pick the day off the calendar that worked for both of you.  That your families can come in town and fucking celebrate with you.  It has nothing to do with your day, okay?  You got a fucking, you rented out a church for an hour and a half, and then you rented 
[03:25:00]  out a hall for five hours.  It has nothing, and you paid a lot of money.  It's not your day, all right?  Stop saying that.  I want everything to be perfect.  Really?  Is that, yeah, I got it.  Is that what you want?  All right, you want everything to be perfect that don't have a fucking cash bar like these  fucking assholes.  I got to spend all this money, and then all of a sudden, they get there.  It's a cash bar.  You motherfucker, cheap bastard.  I had to buy a new suit because my wife was fucking driving me nuts. 
[03:25:30]  You got to get another suit.  Come on, that's dated, that suit.  I'll go with you.  I'll pick it out.  She had to buy a dress that you had to fucking buy on your credit card.  You had to get a hotel room that night.  You had to take a day off from work.  All of this shit, right?  Yeah, all of that.  And then I get in there, and you got a cash bar, so I got to pay for drinks.  You know what, motherfucker?  This is what I'm going to do.  The card I'm giving you, I'm taking the cash out of there to pay for my drinks.  That's how it works. 
[03:26:00]  It'll just be easier, you know, to have a cash bar because not everybody drinks.  No, you're a cheap bastard.  I'm not buying that.  You're wrong.  You're wrong.  They can have fucking eight sodas then.  They can have eight bottles of water then at the bar.  Everybody's going to drink something.  It's hot in there.  I used to DJ weddings before I started doing comedy.  I'm not proud of it, but that's where a lot of this anger and rage comes from. 
[03:26:30]  I have my own business.  I used to have business cards.  I remember what they said.  It said, thinking about having an affair, dot, dot, dot, called Jammin' Jim.  I'm not proud of it.  That was my DJ name, Jammin' Jim.  I had long hair.  I used to DJ on the radio and rock clubs, and then I started DJing weddings because you  can make like 500 bucks in four hours or whatever.  There was some money in it, but I fucking hated it.  I lasted like three months.  I wouldn't play anybody's songs. 
[03:27:00]  I was rude to people.  I never played Celebration.  One time, I think I played it because the Browning group would come up, look, you have  to put it on.  People come up, could you play Hot, Hot, Hot?  I'm like, nope.  Come on.  I like that song.  I don't give a shit.  I don't like it.  What do you got back there?  Who cares?  Don't worry about what I got back there.  You're not a DJ.  I am.  My friend, Ron Gardner from Cleveland, he came to my show a few weeks ago, and he's a 
[03:27:30]  DJ at a wedding, and he had the awful name, Rockin' Ron, too.  So Rockin' Ron, Jammin' Jim stinks.  I know, both.  And he was telling me about that.  He goes, you should do a podcast.  I'm like, you're right.  I got a lot of rage, because I did it for years.  I would put, like, Metallica on when they were eating, like, a slow song, To Live and  To Die.  You know, that instrumental, like, that's, like, nine minutes.  Like, what is this?  Don't worry about it.  Just fucking hurry up and eat.  All right?  So I can get out of here.  Yeah, but this is my day.  I want to hear what I want to hear. 
[03:28:00]  Then what do you want to hear, fatso?  Besides you chewing, what do you want to hear?  I lasted three months.  I'm like, I can't take this anymore.  I just wouldn't play people's songs.  I'm like, nope.  Look, I didn't play Slayer the whole show, the whole fucking wedding.  But I'm like, nah, I'm not playing We Are Family.  I'm not playing that.  I'm not playing this.  I'm not playing the chicken dance.  No, I'm not going out there.  Could you show somebody how to play, how to do the chicken dance? 
[03:28:30]  No.  No.  Absolutely not.  Get somebody out here.  I didn't have props.  These fucking DJs.  Oh, we're going to do a little air guitar.  I'm going to put an outfit on.  I'm going to put a wig and an air guitar, and I'm going to play You Shook Me All Night Long,  and everyone's going to think this is funny and get the party started.  That's not getting a party started.  You want to get a party started?  Just have a couple of girls start blowing guys on the dance floor.  That's a party.  To me, hey, the party started.  Look at this.  This is awesome. 
[03:29:00]  Not some air.  I'm going to put a wig on.  You see?  You get it?  Look, I'm going to air guitar.  You want to hand the air?  Who wants an air guitar?  Who wants a guitar?  Come out on the dance floor with me.  That stinks.  That's fucking corny.  That belongs at a kid's party.  No one over eight should have a frigging air guitar contest.  We're going to play out there.  This is going to be fun.  You guys ready?  We're going to put some outfits on.  That's right. 
[03:29:30]  The silence.  It's my day.  The gifts.  You just rape your friends.  They're going to sign up for the registry.  Yeah.  I want a crock pot.  And I want to get.  Yeah.  Well, I want to get some silverware.  You know, then you get your wife's like, oh, we got to.  Did you look at the registry? 
[03:30:00]  No.  I don't even know what that is.  You didn't go online and look what they know.  Well, what fucking guy would do that?  I don't even know what.  Where online?  Why would I go?  They put a list of gifts up that we're supposed to get on.  And then, you know, and if someone buys one, they check it off.  So, you know, two people don't buy the same thing.  Oh, really?  All right.  Well, you know what?  I'm just going to give my friend cash because he's a fucking alcoholic and he's a gambler.  And he'd much rather fucking 300 bucks or 250 or 500 in an envelope, $500 bills than a fucking crock pot. 
[03:30:30]  No, but it's on the registry.  No one got it yet.  I can go to Bed Bath & Beyond and get one.  No.  Yeah, but his wife, I was talking to her wife yesterday.  She's like, I hope someone gets me to crock pot because I want to make some beef stew.  Is that what you want to do?  You want to make some beef stew with your fucking crock pot?  Yeah.  You know, if I have people over, I'll just make a bunch of beef stew, honey. 
[03:31:00]  So we should put a crock pot on the registry, shouldn't we?  No.  We've been living in this fucking condo for three years.  One guy stayed over once because he was fucking hammering and he was puking on himself.  We took his keys away.  Other than that, nobody stays over.  I don't need a crock pot.  There's no place to put it.  I got to fucking get a storage unit just to buy.  Yeah, but how about a toaster oven then?  We don't eat toast.  Yeah, but just in case people are over, you know, stay over.  We can make breakfast in the morning.  How about we just go to the diner right down the street? 
[03:31:30]  Wouldn't that be easier?  Now I got to put a toaster oven?  Where am I going to put that?  We'll put it up in the closet with the crock pot.  You never know when people are going to come over.  No, I know.  They don't.  We've been here for three years.  Nobody comes over.  And if they do, if we want to make a beef stew, we got a fucking big pot right under the sink.  We'll throw it in there.  Yeah, but the crock pot's got the timer on it.  Yeah, well, I got a timer right on my iPhone.  Right on my iPhone.  36 minutes, fucking timer.  The bell's going to go off in 36 minutes. 
[03:32:00]  What's the difference?  Yeah, but I want one.  It's my day.  Is it really your day?  Yeah, it's my day.  It's Nikki's day today.  Everybody.  I don't know.  I was watching CNN.  I didn't see that on the crawl.  The scrawl or whatever the fuck you call it.  I didn't see it on the bottom.  It's today is Nikki's day.  Because she found some fat guy to marry her.  Yuck. 
[03:32:30]  Leave your kids at home.  Leave them at home.  Just get in the way to no fun.  Enough with kids.  They're going to come out with those fucking DJs when they make an announcement.  Ladies and gentlemen, please stand for the first time in public.  Like, announce his husband and wife. 
[03:33:00]  Yuck.  Yeah, we get it.  I know the guy's last name.  I have a feeling that once they get married, the woman's going to take the last name.  So you call her Mr. or Mrs. whatever the guy's last name is.  Right for the first time in public.  I, I, I, I, I, I, oh.  Stinks.  I came out one time.  Bob Levy, my friend, the comedian. 
[03:33:30]  He got married on a Sunday.  I was so fucking aggravated because it was football season.  And I was going to miss the game.  I remember it was a four o'clock game.  I'm a Dolphin fan.  The Dolphins are playing the Raiders.  And it was actually on TV.  And I came out.  I had a little, one of those little fucking TVs, you know, those old school little TVs.  I had the antenna up.  It was on local TV.  So I got it.  It was down by Philly.  So I got it on whatever the CBS station it was, I guess, channel three. 
[03:34:00]  I walked out when they introduced ourselves in the wedding party.  And I was watching the game as I walked out.  I didn't even look at anybody.  I didn't want to miss a play the whole time.  Even when I danced with the fucking, now the, the bridal party come in and dance with the bride and groom.  I still, over her shoulder, I was watching the game dance, whatever fucking slob I was dancing with.  And I yelled at, why are you doing this on a Sunday?  And people come over, what's the score?  And they were getting killed.  And I was even made me even more aggravated. 
[03:34:30]  What's the score?  Go fuck yourself.  Don't worry about it.  I'm just angry I'm here.  Best part about weddings, the old school weddings, they don't do it anymore.  It's those throwaway phones they used to put on the, on the tables.  As soon as they did that, me and my friends, right to the bathroom, took a picture of our balls, our penises, our assholes.  Some would drop a deuce.  We'd take a picture of the logs, everything.  Stretching our penises out, taking pictures out to a big sack of balls.  And then put it right back on the table. 
[03:35:00]  You don't know how many weddings we did that to.  And what happened was, in a couple of them, one of our friends got married.  We did that.  While they were on their honeymoon for two weeks, the mother-in-law went and got the pictures developed for them when they were away.  We didn't really know the mother-in-law that well.  And when they came back, our friend called one of the guys, one of us, and goes, I can't believe you guys fucking did that, man.  That's wrong.  My wife's mother saw what you guys did with those pictures.  She got them developed.  And we're like, yeah, isn't that fucking, that's the point. 
[03:35:30]  That's what we wanted.  They didn't talk to us for like a year.  They were mad at us.  And we were good friends with the guy.  That's how fucking pissed they were.  Another time, I'm at my friend's wedding party.  And someone takes a picture of their penis with the throwaway camera, right?  Now, same thing.  They're on the honeymoon.  The mother, who I'm good friends with, gets the pictures developed and sees the penis.  It was in the bathroom at a urinal. 
[03:36:00]  Sees the penis and fucking flips out.  Because right away, she thinks it's me.  Like, what other guy would do that?  What other human being would do that?  Something so disgraceful and lowbrow.  So she's fuming.  She knows my family.  She didn't want to bother them.  They were on vacation in Hawaii.  She was going to drive over to my parents' house and tell my parents what a fucking scumbag I am.  What a lowlife.  That she had to see my penis taken in her daughter's or her son's wedding pictures.  She was so furious.  She waited, though.  They got home.  And she showed my friend the picture. 
[03:36:30]  She goes, look at this.  Look what he did, that asshole, Jim.  I'm telling his parents.  I am.  I'm calling him up right now.  And he's like, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.  Wait a minute, Mom.  Look at the suit.  You see the suit?  That's not Jim.  Because he had to wear a tux in the fucking wedding party, which I had to wear a tux.  So it was some guy in a suit.  And it wasn't me.  She didn't even realize that.  He goes, yeah, it's a blue suit.  They went up looking back.  It was one of their cousins that's married with like three kids who's a doctor.  Who, in a million years, they would have never suspected.  That's the guy who took a picture of his mule. 
[03:37:00]  And, of course, I got blamed for it because I'm a scumbag.  And thank you.  Because I wish I would have done that and got her that upset.  Always.  Never not funny.  Take the fucking pictures of your mule.  Go back.  Throw it on the table.  Nobody knows nothing.  It's just weddings.  It's just a nightmare.  It's just too much drama going on.  Everything has to be perfect.  It's a strain on the relationship. 
[03:37:30]  Right?  You know, with the woman planning it.  Right?  It's just a disaster.  Everything's got to be perfect because it's my day.  Hey.  The husband doesn't care.  He's like, yeah, whatever.  Whatever you need.  Whatever.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sure.  If you want those.  Yeah.  Get those invitations.  Yeah.  Get that.  That's a fucking damn.  Rent those chairs.  Well, yeah.  I just feel like you don't care.  I know.  I really don't.  I don't know.  It's not. 
[03:38:00]  I don't know.  This isn't my scene.  You need a party where there's fucking booze and music.  I could do that.  That's my specialty.  Okay.  I don't know how to pick out chairs.  I don't know what flowers go with what.  I don't know if this dress goes with that.  I don't know any of that shit.  Stop fucking asking me.  That's your thing.  That's a chick thing.  Just focus on that.  You know, someone wanted me to go, look, I need to get, I need to get, you know, you  to get in the heavy metal. 
[03:38:30]  Forget it.  I don't even know what the fuck I'm talking about.  I'm so aggravated.  It's just a lot of drama.  Everybody's drunk at the wedding.  There's bridesmaids are always crying by the end of the night.  Hey, he hit on me.  I don't, he should dump me a week before the wedding and I had no one to, I feel all weird.  Nobody knows.  Nobody's looking at you.  Okay.  You're the third fucking fat girl in the bridesmaid fucking line.  All right.  There's 350 people here.  Nobody knows you didn't come without a date and nobody gives a shit.  Nobody's looking at you. 
[03:39:00]  Go, that girl doesn't have, where's that girl's date?  Nobody cares.  They're not focused on you.  Stop thinking that.  Your fucking ego's out of control.  I feel weird without a date.  Shut the fuck up.  Nobody gives a crap.  Crying at the end of the night.  Weddings and drunk, arguing.  They're going to a hotel bar afterwards.  The nightmare.  Just a disaster.  I've been to a bunch of weddings and, like I said, DJing them and stuff and stayed in hotels 
[03:39:30]  where there's weddings and there's people, guys are fighting, fucking drunk white guys  fighting because they had too much to drink and they're amateurs.  The girls crying because they're not the ones married.  I caught the bouquet and I thought I was giving you the next one, but he broke up with me.  All right.  Let's get rid of the fucking superstitions at weddings.  Okay.  Whoever catches the bouquet, the girl, that means she's the next one to get married. 
[03:40:00]  Oh, Cindy Carter, I guess she's next.  Really?  She's 30 years old.  She's fucking 40 pounds overweight and she didn't come with a date.  I don't think she's next.  I highly doubt she's next.  She's next to maybe join Weight Watchers because she's like, I got to fucking lose some weight  and find a guy.  That's all she's next with.  If nobody's looking to marry her, she's next.  If she caught the bouquet, you know what that means? 
[03:40:30]  It doesn't mean shit.  I wish someone would do the research on that.  Every girl had caught a bouquet to see if she was the next person in that 350 people to get married  that were at that wedding.  I bet you it's fucking 1%.  All right.  So fucking throw that stupid, dumb, stupid superstition out the window.  It means nothing.  She's next.  She caught the bouquet.  You know what that means? 
[03:41:00]  That means when no one's looking, she might eat it because she's heavy.  That's what that means.  I don't mean to make fun of girls that are overweight.  I really don't.  I should take that back.  But it's fucking funny when I'm ranting.  All right.  I'm not going to go.  The girl that's in fucking perfect shape is going to bring, you know, the bouquet to the gym.  Nothing funny there.  All right.  So relax.  He's picking on women.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Go listen to another podcast. 
[03:41:30]  Then I don't know what to tell you.  We're fucking, I'm riffing.  I'm just making this shit up.  It's fucking, hopefully it's funny.  So stop.  Will you fucking peace?  It was funny up till he made fun of women.  Yeah, well, it's easy to make fun of women with fucking, with weddings because they're a disaster.  There's dumb superstitions.  With the wedding cake, we're going to put it in, you put it in the freezer.  You know, the bride and groom take the wedding cake home.  They put it in the freezer and then they have a piece of cake one year later. 
[03:42:00]  That's good luck.  Really?  Is that good luck?  How many, let's fucking, I wish someone researched that.  You know, what happened after a year and a half?  You know, imagine if a wedding just fucking, you know, fell to peace after a year and a half and you go to your buddy too.  What happened, man?  You guys aren't getting along.  Nope, dude.  We were getting along great, but we fucking forgot to eat the wedding cake that was in the freezer on our anniversary.  And six months later, we were divorced.  It just fucking, all of a sudden, bad shit started happening in our relationship. 
[03:42:30]  Really?  You think it's because of the cake?  Yeah, you know, we, yeah, we bought it home and, you know, you're supposed to eat it on your anniversary one year later.  We had it in the freezer.  We just totally forgot.  Really?  And that's what ended your marriage.  So when you're in court and two divorce lawyers are going back and forth and they go, what's the reason for this divorce?  Well, you look, you know, they didn't eat the wedding cake when they were supposed to a year later and just things got bad from there.  If I was the judge, I'm like, both of you get the fuck out of here.  Get out. 
[03:43:00]  We got to eat a year later.  That's good luck.  No, it's not.  The fucking wedding cake stunk when I ate it a year ago, okay, when it was fresh.  Now it's been sitting in the freezer with fucking freezer frost on it and fucking icing and shit's been on top of it for a year.  Now I got to eat another piece of it a year later.  I don't think so.  Enough with the wedding cakes.  All right.  You want to go to a taste testing to taste the wedding cake with me?  It's only like an hour and a half to having a bunch of no. 
[03:43:30]  Why not?  Because I don't care.  I don't eat fucking, I never eat cake.  Yeah, but I just, you know, it's for the wedding.  It's important.  No, it's not.  Nobody gives a shit.  Nobody walks away from a wedding talking about that wedding cake was amazing.  Nobody, nobody does that.  Okay.  You just fucking cut a slice.  It's like a kid's fucking party.  That's what that wedding cake tastes like.  All right.  You got fucking duped into thinking it's a good wedding cake.  Just go with me.  I want to pick out the right one. 
[03:44:00]  Every cake is the right one.  All right.  It's four and a half hours into the fucking ceremony.  Everybody's hammered.  So it's not going to take, they got fucking alcohol on their breath and in their fucking body.  They just drank a fucking three, three shots of whiskey.  All right.  They're not going to know if this cake tastes good or not.  Enough.  Just go with me.  I'm not even getting off the couch to go into the kitchen to taste the cake.  It's important to me because, you know, when the cake comes out, don't you like it when the, when the husband and wife, when the DJ plays? 
[03:44:30]  The bride cuts the cake, right?  And then you, you have to stand and he cuts it first because I think it's good luck, right?  If the guy does, he has to, she has to hold his wrist.  Is that how it works or something?  I don't even know.  Yeah.  They're going to cut it.  They cut a piece.  Oh, let's see what that means.  That means they cut their cake.  I realize that what it means.  Yeah.  Oh, are they going to, are they going to smoosh it in their face?  Are they going to do it?  Oh, oh no.  They're going to feed each other.  Is she going to do it? 
[03:45:00]  Oh, no.  He did it.  He put it in her face.  Oh.  Oh, isn't that funny?  And then she did it back to him.  Now they both got cake on their faces.  Isn't this a fun wedding?  Isn't this fun?  You see, there's so much fun because she put cake on his face and then he did it back.  That stinks.  Nothing fun about that.  Nothing.  Take the whole cake up and fucking dump it on her head.  That'd be fun.  I go, this now, this fucking, this wedding started. 
[03:45:30]  This is a fucking party.  Don't put it on his head.  It is fun.  It's my day.  Don't put the cake in my face.  Yeah.  I have a feeling you don't want the cake in your face.  You don't want anything else in your face either.  So I have a feeling something that's fucking tastes delicious is going to be a problem too.  And we'll leave that at that.  I think you know what I'm talking about.  The fucking drunk, corny guy.  There's no segues in this, by the way, this podcast. 
[03:46:00]  All right.  I know you should fucking stick with a theme, but I'm just all over the place because there's a lot of shit to cover.  And I'm aggravated.  They want silverware.  I think I'm going to go check out the, why?  What?  They don't have silverware.  What do they eat with their hands?  No, but they want new silverware.  That's not my fucking problem.  What's wrong with the old shit?  What, the fork doesn't stick into the fucking pancakes anymore?  It's not my problem.  That they just, they want, you know, they want new silverware.  So they put it on there. 
[03:46:30]  So maybe we should just get them silverware.  Just give them cash.  All right.  Only chicks want the gifts.  The guys want cash.  All right.  Give, the guy probably had to pay for the wedding if the fucking, you know, if the woman's dad didn't.  All right.  So just give him cash.  He'd much rather open an envelope, a cash thing, go, yeah, they got me the crock.  But thanks, dude.  No one, no guy ever sent a text out going, dude, thanks for the crock pot.  Nobody.  Maybe we should get the big salad bowl for them. 
[03:47:00]  Really?  The fucking couple weighs 400 pounds a piece.  They, I don't think they eat salad.  Maybe they're going to use it for fucking potato chips, that big bowl.  All right.  So just call it the potato chip bowl.  Don't fucking try to con me by saying you want a big salad bowl because you're going to make salad.  You're not making salad.  Yeah.  We're going to have people over and, you know, I'll make them all this stuff.  I want to have it just in case.  Really?  You got a dining room.  It's been sitting there fucking for eight years. 
[03:47:30]  Nobody's even walked in it.  Just put police tape around your fucking dining room because no one's allowed in there.  It's a fucking waste of space.  All right.  Never fucking whoever's designing houses.  Now get rid of the fucking dining room.  This is in the 1950s where people got dressed up and come over your house for dinner.  We don't do that anymore.  We're fucking miserable.  We're angry.  Don't want to be around people.  We're busy.  We got shit going on.  I don't have time to get dressed up to go to a dinner.  All right.  In your dining room.  We're going to use the good silverware today. 
[03:48:00]  Is that really opposed to the bad?  What's the bad?  Well, this is more shiny.  Or fucking just all this shit going on.  All that is just nonsense.  It's just fucking garbage.  It's just shit.  So now all this silverware that we got two years ago is no good anymore.  We're going to get dumped at because, you know, we can get it for free.  So what?  I like the silverware.  This is fine.  I like this fucking spoon.  It's nice and big.  It's perfect for what I need. 
[03:48:30]  We can just go to the registry.  It'll be fun.  People can pick out stuff.  Just listen to me.  It's my day.  Cunt.  I don't want to be in your wedding party.  You know what I do?  Hey, dude, you want to be my best man?  I just make up shit.  Look, dude, I got to be honest with you.  Like five years ago, I was drunk.  I ate your fucking fiance's box.  I ate her box one night.  I'm sorry.  But, you know, I was hammered.  You still want me as your best man? 
[03:49:00]  Yeah, I don't think so.  Good.  Just save myself a grand.  Nice.  Just save myself a grand.  Because I said that I ate your fiance's box five years ago.  That's how you get out of a wedding party.  Just say something awful.  A destination wedding.  Yeah, they're going to have a destination wedding.  So you want all your friends to go fly to a fucking island. 
[03:49:30]  Because you fucking spoiled brat.  God, that's why I want to get married.  I always dreamed of that when I was a girl, a little girl.  No, you didn't.  You didn't dream of that.  You dreamt that you wish your parents would stop fucking bickering.  And be out of throats and stop arguing and screaming.  Because it scared you in your room.  And you held on to your little fucking dolls.  That's what you dreamed of when you were a kid.  You didn't dream of a fucking wedding in St. Martin. 
[03:50:00]  Where all your friends are going to have to spend like ten grand just to go there.  Okay?  No one's, no fucking little girl dreamt that.  That's fucking selfish.  You're just thinking about yourself.  And then you get mad when your friends don't come.  And it puts your friends in a compromising position.  Because they're good friends where you're like, look, I can't take off of work.  You know, it's going to cost a lot.  I just looked in the flights.  It's $780 to go to fucking St. Martin at that time.  It's right in season.  So that's $1,500 just on plane tickets. 
[03:50:30]  I know, but they're going to, we're their best friends.  They're going to be mad.  Well, they fucking started this shit.  I don't want to go to St. Martin with you, let alone them.  How about when they come home, we'll throw a fucking party for them?  I have a feeling.  What are we going there for?  What?  So they could be on the beach and they both go, I do?  I have a feeling they're both going to say yes.  If they book that trip that far, I have a feeling it's going to go pretty good.  I have a feeling someone at the end is going to go, you know what?  No.  And leave them at the altar. 
[03:51:00]  How about one of their friends fucking video it on their iPhone?  They send it to us.  Yep.  It went down.  They said, I do.  Okay.  If you're, if you book a destination wedding, you're a cunt.  That's my quote of the week.  If you're a woman and you book a destination wedding, you're a cunt.  The only thing you're thinking of is yourself.  If you're going to do it, don't invite anybody.  Tell everybody, hey, we want to go make our marriage on our own in this little island and 
[03:51:30]  we're going to have a big party and we'll get back.  I got no problem with that.  But when you book that and you want your friends and some people, certain people, whoever  can make it to come, you're a cunt.  No other way around it.  All right.  And people are always going to remember that.  And they're always going to be resentful that you did that to them.  And you, you took money away from their own vacation that they want to go on.  And now you've got to be there with them.  So your, your relationship isn't even that good.  Now you've got to be around them for the next seven days and watch them be all over each 
[03:52:00]  other because they just got married and you've got to sit there like now there's pressure  on you.  Fuck.  Now I got to hold her hand.  Now I got to go another romantic dinner.  Yeah, we're going to go here and we're going to do this.  So we're going to go hiking and, and all that shit.  Now you've got to do all that.  You, cause you feel pressure.  Yeah, that's a, yeah, that's good.  Some friend you are.  What about the DJ when he's playing the songs and he's got like his one headphone on his  ear and the other piece off the left one.  And he's like, we're listening. 
[03:52:30]  Cause he's queuing up the next thing and he's like rocking out.  Oh, look, the DJ, he's having fun.  Cause he's kind of moving.  He's moving to the music.  He's having fun.  No, he's not.  He doesn't want to be there.  He really thought he'd be a DJ on a, on a fucking, in a club down Atlantic city or Vegas or somewhere  or New York city, a fucking hip club where he's making like five grand a night.  He's making 800 bucks to entertain you fucking assholes and play songs that he hates.  He's not having fun. 
[03:53:00]  It didn't really work out for him so far.  This is his bootcamp and the DJing.  He doesn't want to be here.  It's not fun for him.  He's not having a good time.  He's just fucking going through the motions.  All right.  He's just putting on a fucking smiley face.  Yeah.  Let me move to it.  So people think I'm good.  Then I'm having a good time.  No reason for engagement parties.  People are already spending enough money.  We don't want to go to your fucking party.  We get it.  You get, you knock your chick up.  So you get married.  All right. 
[03:53:30]  We're going to see you at your wedding in fucking six months.  Now we have to have a party.  And so we have to bring more shit and buy more shit and maybe buy another outfit to come to your  engagement party.  Stop.  These DJs stop playing hip hop at the weddings.  Okay.  Look at your crowd.  Look, judge your crowd.  All right.  You're in a VFW hall.  The fucking food is getting heated by sternos.  Okay.  It's white trash. 
[03:54:00]  Look at the people here.  Okay.  The bride and groom requested you play paradise by the dashboard light by meatloaf.  All right.  They don't want to hear hip hop.  They don't know what it is.  They don't understand that music.  They don't get it.  They never will.  Don't fucking force it on them.  They don't want to hear it.  It's fucking, yeah.  We're going to put a little, little hip hop up now.  Look at your crowd.  Go.  Did no one's going to be into this?  Well, then maybe they'll know a little like kind of dance. 
[03:54:30]  It's just like, how about the black eyed peas?  I got a feeling.  That's a good one.  That's going to get everybody on the dance floor.  Don't you like it when all the white people go out?  Because, yeah, they like the black eyed peas.  That's a safe group to like.  I hear that on the, on the Z Morning Zoo.  They play it a lot.  I got a feeling.  Yuck.  That song stinks.  I got, I got a feeling this wedding's not going to work out.  There's already tension.  That's my feeling. 
[03:55:00]  I got a feeling I'm going to shit myself after this bad food I just ate.  I never had almonds in my fucking, in my green beans before.  That's my feeling.  I got a feeling.
