<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts – Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton – engaging in their characteristically vulgar and comedic banter, focusing on bodily functions, sex, and Norton's attraction to transgender individuals.  They launched into "Jacktober," a recurring segment showcasing clips from other radio shows, specifically targeting Ted Long and Amy Robbins from Syracuse's 93Q.  They discussed a previous guest, Todd, known for his volatile reactions to interruptions, leading into a self-deprecating analysis of their own verbal tics ("brutal," "Uber," "phenomenal") illustrated with audio montages.

Anthony then recounted a Yankees game experience, detailing his prime seats, celebrity sightings (Mayor Giuliani and Lorne Michaels), a home run derby, failed attempts at seat upgrades, and observations of fellow fans, including the team's rivalry with the Orioles.  The narrative included his frustration with the game's pace slowing down.  Norton interjected with a bizarre story about following an MTA bus displaying a "Call Police 911" sign, his interaction with (in his opinion) incompetent 911 dispatchers, and his ultimately abandoning the pursuit.  The hosts speculated on the bus driver's motives and Norton's near-heroic actions, transitioning into a discussion of viral videos, including one of Sam Roberts, and a "Real or Fake" video analysis website's erroneous claim of fakery. This led to a heated debate about the renaming of Syracuse University's sports teams and the broader, offensive controversy surrounding Native American team names, including the Washington Redskins.  The segment concluded with more vulgar banter and a promise to return to "Jacktober."

The next section briefly mentioned previous guests Jesse Ventura and Donald Sutherland, highlighting Sutherland's reportedly terrified initial reaction to the show.  A lengthy segment analyzed videos from "Right This Minute"'s "Real or Fake" segment, focusing on a lightning strike and an iPhone 5 queue.  The hosts debated the authenticity and motivations behind these videos, even trying (unsuccessfully) to contact a woman featured in one.  This transitioned into a scathing critique of Ted Long and Amy Robbins' radio show, filled with offensive jokes targeting their appearance, age, on-air style, a Dr. Seuss listener contest, and perceived use of a pre-written content service ("Prep Burger"), interspersed with speculation about their relationship.  The hosts expressed strong disapproval of Amy Robbins' radio persona.  The show briefly touched upon the 10th anniversary of the Beltway sniper attacks and a gun control PSA featuring a Colorado shooting victim, eliciting cynical commentary from the hosts.  A humorous "How Much" segment followed, employing absurd calculations using foreskins as a unit of measurement.  The show ended with a preview of an "Amy's Slumber Party" video and a further tease of the Syracuse radio show takedown.

A subsequent portion began with another high-speed chase anecdote (this time not involving Jim Norton), followed by a discussion of a British PSA about used condoms and the authenticity thereof.  This moved to a critique of one host's videos and their perceived shift towards using paid actresses.  A major segment analyzed the Rick Ross/Young Jeezy rap feud, including the BET Awards altercation between Gunplay and G-Unit, featuring audio clips and speculation on the motivations.  Other rappers like 50 Cent and Machine Gun Kelly were also discussed, along with the prevalence of violence in hip-hop.  "Jocktober" returned, featuring more mockery of Ted and Amy, playing audio clips, discussing offensive listener-created images from their (since-deleted) Facebook page, and a "Morning Malarkey" game. A call initially believed to be Willie Nelson turned out to be an impersonator. The "slumber party video" was heavily teased, promising shocking content, followed by a humorous anecdote about a "last-minute merger" in a BJ's parking lot, and the anticipated arrival of powdered peanut butter. The segment ended with continued discussion of the "Jocktober" segment.

A listener, Jimmy, then recounted an extremely graphic and profane story about a bizarre altercation in a BJ's parking lot, involving a cart collision and verbal abuse.  This transitioned into a vulgar description of "Amy's Slumber Party" video, emphasizing the women's appearance and behavior using offensive language.  An interview with Cary Elwes followed, discussing *The Princess Bride*, *Saw*, *Twister*, and his charity work.  The interview was punctuated by the hosts' usual vulgar commentary.  The segment concluded with listener mail and social media reactions to the "Jocktober" segment, featuring many crude and offensive messages targeting Ted and Amy.

A segment focused on a contentious discussion about the performance of two interns, Julie and Anthony, and Sal, an employee accused of passive-aggressively sabotaging Julie's work.  The discussion became heated, involving accusations of incompetence and intentional sabotage, with references to past difficult guests like Jesse Ventura and Paris Hilton.  Comedian Bob Kelly called in, expressing his preference for intern Anthony.  The segment concluded with unresolved tensions between Sal and Julie.

The show ended with a repetitive, aggressive, and profane rant focusing on the phrase "laugh your tears away," interspersed with numerous expletives, offensive terms, and references to violence, lacking any identified guests.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Welcome to the R.B. and Earth show.  What ever before has one radio show been so extreme?  So vulgar.  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So flatulent. 
[00:00:30]  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know it started.  Like rotten eggs and sewed.  Oh, wow, thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  It's not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  All in every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what?  Yeah!  Rules are destroyed. 
[00:01:00]  And convention burns the ground.  Would you like to make some fun?  It's a gas.  With Opie the destroyer.  Just pay us, you assholes.  And we'll continue.  Anthony the rage.  Shut the fuck up.  Come to my pool and drown in it.  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender.  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horn should go off.  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:01:30]  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Thank you, Russ Meyer.  How crazy was Todd yesterday?  Holy shit.  Wow, wait.  Wow.  We're gonna have to get him back in.  Yeah.  He's a fun guy to hang out with.  When you stop talking and just listen to him, he just completely loses his mind and panics.  I like when you throw a little monkey wrench in the conversation. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  If he's talking, and then you go, oh, oh, oh, one second.  And he's like, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He just loses his mind.  For the people that weren't listening yesterday, he's a guy that used to work with Dice.  Jim Norton knows him.  Did a short film on Russ Meyer hoping to make it into a feature.  And the 15-minute film was nice.  Yeah.  It was good.  But it was a teaser, really.  That was fun yesterday.  I was howling.  Wow.  I was thinking of that video and how funny it was.  Not even so much the howling, howling, but the guy put in wolf pictures. 
[00:02:30]  So you're listening to it and it's just wolves.  Oh, boy.  Like, I'm aware of some of my crutches, but that one I had no idea.  You know what?  That one I had no fucking idea.  I remembered another one that I have.  Yeah?  I say brutal a lot.  Oh, brutal.  Oh, good.  Brutal.  Let's get the brutal montage.  Brutal.  Yeah, yeah.  We all have them.  Then we could do another one for me, which is Uber.  I know.  People are like, you also do Uber.  I know, idiot.  Relax. 
[00:03:00]  I was Uber howling.  Right.  I have a couple, too, I'm sure.  Oh.  No, Jimmy, you're perfect.  You're a perfect little boy.  I hate hearing mine.  What's yours?  I don't know, but I know I have it.  If I thought about it, I could find probably five or six.  I don't know if, let me think.  I don't know what yours is.  Massive aggressive, I've said too many times.  There's a bunch.  I probably look back.  Once they did nail you with one, Phenomenal.  Oh, yeah.  Phenomenal.  That's right.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, Phenomenal.  That's right.  Phenomenal.  Yeah, we all got him.  Is this the one?  How'd you pull that up so fast, D-Roy?  He's awake today.  He's awake every day.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Do you ever look back, and again, I know I do, when you look back on something you feel  great about, and then you look back on it and you go, ugh, what the fuck was I thinking? 
[00:04:00]  Yeah, I'm still doing that.  I'm still doing that.  I'm going to Sabbath stuff.  Turn this off.  Why is he in fast voice?  Yeah, it's me talking to Bill Ward.  Because it's like the goofy fast voice.  Like a Muppet.  Phenomenal.  All right.  Phenomenal.  Someone else says, well, I have another crutch word that we can't put on the air.  Yeah, that's more of a crutch lifestyle.  Travis is working on one for Jim.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, no.  I have another one. 
[00:04:30]  Let me guess.  I don't know if I can.  Phenomenal.  I know.  Just so many.  Maybe something with hats.  Yeah, but I mean, that's what I do on purpose.  It's probably something I do subconsciously.  Do you always do that on purpose?  I was suspicious of that one.  No, that and Ted.  You finally realized you would go to hats a lot and then decided, fuck it, I'll just go with it?  They're just funny to me.  All right, good.  And Ted, it was one that became Ted Sheckler.  But that at first was not, you know.  Yes.  Well, Kevin Atlanta is saying that you say enraging a lot.  Okay, that's probably very true. 
[00:05:00]  And Dullard.  Listeners are stupid.  Exactly.  He's just, he's talking about how I discuss the listeners.  Dullard can't forget your use of, absolutely, you say a lot.  Probably, yeah.  Probably.  The listeners would know, you know how you don't notice when you say shit, but now that  we say that, I'm probably going to have fucking 20 of them pop up.  But some of them are in crutches.  Some of them are just like funny to say, because somebody's bringing up here about when you  put in like whatever McGillicuddy.  But that's like funny.  It's not a crutch.  It's not a running joke.  That's just hilarious. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, that's a silly running joke.  McGillicuddy.  Yeah, big, big clit McGillicuddy.  Like, who would say that for real?  Big clit McGillicuddy is great.  If we follow the listeners around for a week, we would get their crutches, too.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Donuts.  Anyway, how was the Yankee game yesterday?  It was fantastic.  Or is it Yankees?  The Yankees.  The Yankee game.  Yankees game.  It was freaking great.  You had good seats, I saw.  Yeah, unbelievable. 
[00:06:00]  We were right, right in front of the on-deck circle for the Yankees.  Damn.  So they would just come out and fucking, the people harass them when they come out in the  on-deck.  Yeah, people just, hey, hey.  The other team?  No, you were on the Yankee side.  No, no, the fans.  Yeah, yep.  Why?  Some of the fans, they just start yelling out.  They want, like, to get the players' attention.  One guy would just blurt out Spanish shit.  I didn't know what he was saying. 
[00:06:30]  Really?  Yeah.  But, yeah, that was my seat right there.  Wow, dude.  It was Jeter.  What is that, second row?  Third row?  Right there.  About third row, yeah.  Damn it.  Look at that.  Yeah, it was right the fuck there.  Very nice.  Very cool.  Yeah.  Saw all the...  It was kind of one of those weird games.  It was exciting.  Oh, my God.  Yankee scored nine in the first, I think.  It was a home run derby.  Nine in the first?  And then they only scored one other run.  So the rest of the game, you're like, fuck, come on.  Let's get this going.  And then the Sox scored two.  But, man, at the beginning, it was just a home run derby. 
[00:07:00]  There was a back-to-back and a belly-to-belly.  Ah.  And then, yeah, they just kept going around.  It was amazing.  That's a good picture.  That's the Instagram?  Yeah.  That's a good shot.  That's just my shitty iPhone.  That's the regular...  No, I Instagrammed it.  Oh, you did?  It has a painting quality almost.  I put a couple of filters on, a little sat...  I like the saturation.  You filter that.  I like saturation.  That's one thing the Android doesn't really have is a lot of those fun...  A lot of the Instagram...  A lot of those fun filters.  Yeah, I use... 
[00:07:30]  Which one do I fucking use?  Because everybody asks me, which filter do you use when you're Instagramming, Anthony?  I use Snapseed.  Snapseed filter for Instagram is great.  How do you do that?  Well, you download it from the App Store.  And then what happens?  And then you take your picture.  You put it in Snapseed.  And then you can adjust all the parameters.  I usually like brightening it up a little bit.  I use some ambience.  And then I use a little more contrast.  And then I saturate it a lot because it brings out all those colors. 
[00:08:00]  It brings out the blues.  Yes.  Yes.  And then I kick back, just slightly back on the white balance a little bit.  And it makes for a very nice picture.  Oh, I'm just sitting there with Instagram with the basic filters.  Oh, no, no, no.  Waiting for Instagram to give me more options.  No.  No, that was dumb on my part.  Then you could be like Bob Kelly and just slide every slider as far as they go for every parameter  until it just looks like some kind of Andy Warhol painting. 
[00:08:30]  Everything he takes a picture of has a cartoony quality to it.  I don't like that.  People are overusing that shit.  It was fun at first, but now it's like, oh, crap.  Yeah, one picture to make it look kind of funky or artistic.  But if every picture you do is like that, now who else is doing like wacky pictures?  Eastside Dave now cannot take a normal picture.  I don't know what he's discovered, but it's all these wacky cosmic fucking J.J. Abrams lens  flares are on them.  Good old Eastside Dave. 
[00:09:00]  Eastside Dave.  How's he doing, man?  There's a picture of him with a skeleton face.  Bob took a good one of an apple in his hand, which I just 50 jokes flew out of my mouth.  Oh, I know.  But did you see the picture where he's holding an apple?  I saw the one with the sugar cubes.  Yeah, see, Dave's every picture now is Eastside Dave with some there.  There's the lens flare.  You could just do lens flare?  Is that one of the...  Yeah, there's all kinds of filters you could throw on things and stuff. 
[00:09:30]  I want to stay as a purist.  Very creative.  I like being a purist with my Instagram.  I do too.  I try to no filter most of the time.  You just use Instagram.  You don't use Instagram?  Oh, I use Instagram.  I put it up on Instagram, but I filter it in Snapseed first.  You know the one picture service you use?  Snapseed.  Yeah.  I can't load your pictures.  Really?  Well, I can, but it takes forever.  I don't know what the hell that...  Really?  But yeah.  That's odd.  That IMG thing?  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't know what the...  And I know it's with other people that are using that IMG thing.  Like, when you click on that, sometimes the pictures don't come up at all, and other 
[00:10:00]  times it takes a while.  Well, with your pictures, with the service you use, I can't make them bigger on the screen.  Like, well, whatever...  Oh, it's Instagram?  Yeah, you can't make them bigger.  So how do you fix that?  I can't swipe...  I don't know.  I don't know.  Is that an Instagram problem?  Like, I can't take my two fingers and do that, whoosh, and make it bigger on the screen.  Well, that's dumb.  How do I solve that?  That's from the Ryder Cup. 
[00:10:30]  That was a fan.  Sunday morning, as the sun was coming up on Medina.  God, we got fans all over the place.  Then there's another guy that's in the booth for the Ryder Cup, with all the fucking monitors.  That's pretty cool.  Works for the network, and he's a big fan of the show.  So it's pretty cool when you see what these guys do for a living.  Yeah.  So at the Yankee game, that's a horrible wig guy.  I saw him.  Why would you do that?  I saw his honor, Mayor Giuliani, inside the legend eating area. 
[00:11:00]  He was there with this big, burly bodyguard.  So I saw him.  And then, I guess the eighth inning, a lot of people started to leave because it was a 9-2 blowout by the Yankees.  Much to Travis's chagrin, whose Baltimore, they lost last night.  Oops.  So, yeah.  And there's this kind of neck-and-neck thing going on between the Yankees and Baltimore.  The Yankees are one game ahead now?  Yeah, yeah.  How did that happen?  They lost.  Baltimore lost, and the Yankees won last night. 
[00:11:30]  Well, Earl said that the monster has been woken.  Oh, is that it?  God, I wanted to drive over to his place.  Oh, Jesus.  If he didn't live in such a dark neighborhood, I would move over and strangle them.  He actually tweeted, I guess the monster has a woken.  What?  Because the team won the game?  Because Yankees fans.  And they won against, like, last place Red Sox.  Yes, the Red Sox.  They don't give a fuck.  They don't stink this season.  Are they last season?  Last place?  They're the worst since, like, 1966.  They haven't given a fuck since, I don't know, June, maybe. 
[00:12:00]  June of this year.  Yeah.  And stupid Earl, the monster has awoken.  Nah.  Has it, Earl?  But it was fun to watch that home run derby.  And then after everybody kind of left after, I guess, the seventh inning, around there, eighth,  I decided I was going to get up and get a seat behind home plate.  And I was going to try to do some type of filleting of my beer bottle or some blowjob mannerisms behind the plate. 
[00:12:30]  So I did get up and I sat behind the plate and was promptly told to get back to my fucking seat.  Oh, were you embarrassed that they told you to get back?  Nah, I didn't give a shit.  I wish I could have stayed.  I would have really embarrassed myself.  I told you before the show, they're just looking to get greased.  I didn't know that.  These assholes that, you know, what are they, ushers, I guess, in these stadiums, they all  have that one section they take care of and they study it like a hawk, not because they're  trying to do the right thing for the organization. 
[00:13:00]  They want to get money.  See, I didn't know that.  So as soon as you pop in those seats, they run down and go, hey, you can't sit there.  And a lot of people go, well, come on.  And they'll like, you know, throw a 10 or a 20 at them and they'll go, okay, and they'll  let you sit there.  Happens at the Islanders games all the fucking time.  Huh?  Probably be 50 bucks for those seats, no?  I could have thrown them a lot of money there.  Yeah, he wants money, so.  That's what I'm saying.  If you give him 10, he'll probably go, all right.  Especially late in the game like that?  Yeah, of course.  For guarantee, though, if I would have given him a couple of 20s or something like that,  he definitely would have let you sit there.  Then I could have just fucking. 
[00:13:30]  All those guys, they're just looking for a handout.  Doing horrible things behind the plate.  They want to come, they want to go home with some cash.  That's all.  They don't care.  They don't care that seat's empty.  Oh, man.  And then I saw, sitting right in front of the mayor, the ex-mayor, whatever you want  to call him, what's-his-facey from SNL, you know, the big guy, the honcho.  Lorne Michaels?  Ah, Lorne Michaels.  Oh, Lorne was there.  Lorne Michaels was there.  He walked right past me, too, when I was eating in the Legends section. 
[00:14:00]  Yes, yes.  Actually, the dining room.  The Legends dining room.  And Joe Torre was there, got a big ovation, much bigger than Billy Crystal, who got a  little ovation.  And then some guy, they had him on the big screen, Joe Torre was there, and everybody's  clapping, and some idiot is just standing in front of the big, like he's standing in  front of Torre.  They have the camera on him, and he's just oblivious to the fact that he's on the screen  blocking Joe Torre.  The screen is as big as the sky.  It's giant.  Like the guy has no idea he's blocking Joe Torre. 
[00:14:30]  That's everybody.  People are just assholes.  They don't just have no clue.  He's a genius.  Oh, maybe.  Maybe.  Because then, like, after about three minutes, they went back to Joe Torre on the screen.  And because it was that, he was that obtrusive.  So they had to go back.  So they had to go back to him.  Yeah.  So he was there.  There were a lot of celebrities and whatnot.  It was a fun game.  You know, like you said, after that second inning, trouncing. 
[00:15:00]  Well, you get excited when it just kind of turned into it.  This is one of those big innings, and you think the whole game's going to go like that.  No.  You're going to see something really special, and then it turns out to be five or six really  boring innings.  Yeah.  Do people crap for Joe Torre?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  They kind of like him up there.  They love him.  They kind of like that guy.  They love him.  Very good.  Yeah.  Oh, Bears beat the Cowboys?  I didn't fucking watch.  Ant's new bit, name dropper?  Shut up.  Oh, yeah.  You went to an event where there were a lot of celebrities, man.  Oh, God.  You're not a Cowboys fan yet there, Jimmy? 
[00:15:30]  I watched a little bit on the, I was at the cellar list, and I watched for a few minutes.  It was no score.  But I'm a fan of the team compared to the way I feel about other teams, but I just don't  give a shit.  Your Cowboys are two and two.  Two and two, yeah.  Even though they're not really your Cowboys these days.  Yeah, they were for many years.  My Jets are two and two.  Oh.  Your Cowboys are two and two.  Yeah.  Romo had five interceptions last night.  But that makes it harder to root for the team because I hate Jerry Jones, and I just  don't like Romo.  And I don't think that, the fact that they make him the franchise quarterback drives me 
[00:16:00]  crazy.  You talking about Sanchez?  No.  Oh, yeah.  Exactly.  We got the same quarterback, basically.  It's fucking, the guy's a choke artist, and he's, well, I'll tell you what ruined Romo's  career.  It was when he fucking, his little dumb, fruity hands allowed that, when he was holding the  snap, and he fucking fumbled it, and he fucked up.  That cost him a career because he knew he was never good under pressure after that.  Wow.  I think that one play wrecked him, and I think he stinks.  Wrecked him. 
[00:16:30]  Well, the Jets are going to go with Sanchez against the Texans.  That's wonderful.  They're staying with Sanchez.  Yeah, I heard that on the news.  And one idiot in the paper's like, give Sanchez four more games before you try the Tebow experiment.  Sanchez sucks, too.  I'm not saying Tebow's a great quarterback, but I don't know.  He has that it factor.  Oh, and he's very motivated.  He's got his helmet on all the time.  He's ready to, come on, coach.  I'm ready.  Whenever.  But he had his helmet on to the end of the game. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  He's that type of guy.  He was all ready.  Look, man, I'm ready.  Just put me in.  Ready to go.  I don't know.  I don't know what to think.  The Jets are horrible this year.  Their record doesn't show that.  They should have never won against the Dolphins.  They should be one and three.  And Woody Johnson, the Jets' owner, would rather Romney win the presidency than the Jets have  a winning record.  Well, at least he's got his priorities straight.  Why would you say that?  You could think that.  Yeah.  I don't know.  It's a little weird, right? 
[00:17:30]  It is a little weird.  You probably, your fans probably don't want to hear that.  I don't think so.  Yeah.  Especially 47% of them.  I get it because.  You know, those owners all want fucking Romney, though.  Of course.  There's too much money at stake for that.  We would assume they all want Romney.  Yeah.  But to come out and just say that, that you'd rather have Romney win the White House than  your team have a winning record.  Yeah.  That's a little strange, man.  That's it in sports, I guess.  So what?  There's a big race eating up. 
[00:18:00]  How many games left for the Yankees?  Two more.  Oh, shit.  Two more games.  It's, yeah, apparently with this, with that second wildcard team, they're already in.  So is Baltimore.  But what they're duking it out about is you got that single game playoff between the two  wildcard teams.  So you want to be the guy that actually just clinches the division.  Because you don't want to have your whole season come down to one playoff game where you can lose 
[00:18:30]  and then that's it.  Goodbye.  Do you realize by the time the baseball season's over, football will already be a quarter of  the way done?  Yeah.  Yeah.  For their season?  Yeah.  People are like, who cares about baseball?  It's tough.  It's tough to root for fucking baseball these days.  I know.  We're just living a, I don't know, man.  In this day and age, it's so tough to focus on 162 games. 
[00:19:00]  There was a time there was nothing to do.  So of course you focused on it.  It is funny, though, when you're reading, like, I'm at the park and I'm reading on Twitter,  you know, who cares about baseball?  And I look around early in the game, especially, and Yankee Stadium is packed.  What are they doing?  60,000 people a night?  I mean, are they really?  Yeah, no one cares.  No one cares.  Well, why don't you go across the fucking river and you'll see how they don't care.  The Mets had, what, 5,000 people at their last home game or something?  Like, even still, though, like, when teams draw, like, 10,000 people, like, that's still, 
[00:19:30]  when you think about it, that's a lot of people, you know, that decided to go see a last place  team.  Are the Mets the last?  No, but they're not good.  They're just done.  They have zero shot, right?  There's nothing.  Mathematically.  They've been out of it for a while.  Oh, okay.  For a while.  Yarr.  It's kind of hard to root for a team when they're in last place.  Yes.  Yes, it is.  That's when the true blue fans come in.  Oh, geez.  Exactly.  I followed a bus last night with the call police 911 sign. 
[00:20:00]  Huh?  What happened?  I was driving home and I was behind a bus.  Yeah.  And I saw a sign.  You know, like, the bus has an automatic sign?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  911, call police.  Police, 911.  Oh, yeah, when the driver's having an emergency or something.  You know, where the bus is stolen.  Yeah.  So, I'm fucking following this bus.  You were following a bus last night?  On my way home, I call 911.  Newman.  And I say, look, I'm following this bus.  It's going 10th Avenue northbound.  And 911 operators are fucking... 
[00:20:30]  What kind of bus?  The big city bus?  It was an MTA bus, a double.  Like, two buses together.  And Jimmy's following.  Are you a crime fighter now?  Jimmy is a crime fighter Jimmy.  I was just...  Crime fighter Jimmy.  I didn't know what was happening.  There could have been hostages.  I mean, we all saw that Keanu Reeves movie.  Yes, yes.  But I'm following it and it makes...  We're going 10th, northbound.  And it's from the 40s.  And then it starts to make a left on 57th.  So, I follow it to 57th.  What is...  I'm on the phone with 911.  Right.  And this fucking dummy is...  Where are you now? 
[00:21:00]  I said, I'm northbound on 47th Street on 10th Avenue.  Okay, you're on...  Now, where are you now?  I said, 48th Street.  Oh, Jesus.  Where are you now?  49th Street.  Jimmy cried by him.  And then she goes, which way are you going?  I'm like, I'm on 10th Avenue, northbound.  The only way you can go is so irritated with these trees.  Oh, my God.  Sure.  So, we make the left on 57th Street.  We go down to 11th Avenue.  I go, look, he's making a left on 11th Avenue.  Did you do a pit maneuver?  That's where you hit him on the rear and spin him around?  No?  No, I casually followed down 11th Avenue.  And we had to pass...  I'm out the window? 
[00:21:30]  Casually.  And we get down into, like, the high 40s.  This is great.  And as I'm on the phone, I'm yelling at this person.  I'm like, we're now southbound on 11th Avenue.  Is this a dream?  No, this happened.  You really did this?  Did you hit him with your lights?  I fucking...  We passed a cop who was sitting there.  And I'm like, we're passing a cop right now.  And this call police...  This is great.  Call police 911 is flashing on the fucking thing.  Has he lost his mind?  What's wrong?  I love this.  But I didn't know what it was going on. 
[00:22:00]  I thought it was a stolen bus.  So then it's coming up to...  Wait, wait.  Can I ask you where you were going that you then stopped going there to follow?  Heading home.  Oh, okay.  So then I'm southbound on 11th.  By the way, that means he's not going home anymore.  Oh, no.  I'm going southbound now.  Yeah, now he's following the bus.  I'll take the phone, Daddy, if you want to drive.  What would you have done if all of a sudden they'd hang out the window and start firing at you?  It's like fucking 48 hours, Gans and Billy Bear is shooting up the window at you.  Well, I get down to 40s.  You've gotten the hint at that point? 
[00:22:30]  Well, yeah, I probably would have.  I get down to the 40s.  And it's a yellow light, so the bus slows down and then shoots through the light.  Whoa!  And leaves me at the red light.  Why didn't you go through it?  Because I knew that the bus did that on purpose.  I'm like, this guy knows I'm behind him.  So, because I also, he got stuck at the next light.  Oh.  He got stuck at the next light.  So, I'm off the phone with 911 already.  And now we're going southbound again.  So, I call back.  We start going southbound on 11th Avenue. 
[00:23:00]  And, like, I've never seen a bus go down this way.  So, I'm like, this is weird territory.  11th Avenue past the Lincoln Tunnel all the way down to 34th Street.  And then the bus drives a little erratically.  And then hangs a sharp right on 34th Street towards the West Side Highway.  So, I call again.  911.  I'm like, look, I just called you fucking people.  I'm behind a stolen bus.  This guy, no one is doing it.  How long does it take to get a squad car on fucking 11th Avenue?  So, we...  Jimmy's calling for backup.  And he can't get it.  I'm calling for backup. 
[00:23:30]  You think the bus is on with 911, too?  Yeah, yeah.  Someone's following me.  I'm trying to get away from him.  I'm just trying to lose him.  There's some guy with a tall black girl with a blonde wig following me.  Jimmy Norton, get your ass in my office.  You're just that renegade fucking lone wolf cop.  Yeah, me and my partner calling for backup.  Oh, I get too old for this shit.  So, I fucking get down to 34th.  And we're getting down to the West Side Highway. 
[00:24:00]  Right before the West Side Highway.  And there's cars at the light.  And the bus slows down a lot.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Were you getting nervous now?  No.  I knew what he was doing.  I knew you knew I was behind him.  So, I pull up on the side.  But not...  Because it's such a long bus.  The driver was still ahead of me.  And I'm like, look.  He's going to make a right on the West Side Highway.  So, the bus makes a right on the West Side Highway.  I jump behind him.  And he slows to a crawl.  Oh, shit.  On the West Side Highway.  And I'm on the phone with the person.  I'm like, he's stopping on the fucking West Side Highway.  And I finally just got annoyed.  Because I could see that it was pitch black on the bus. 
[00:24:30]  It was like there was no people on the bus.  It was probably just a stolen bus.  It wasn't like there was people.  So, I pull up next to it.  And it's really dark on the bus.  And I look up.  And I just see some...  There's a black dude.  I'm on the phone.  I'm like, I'm looking at the guy.  Oh, man.  And he's just a black dude.  And he's dressed in...  But he's not dressed like a bus driver.  And he's looking out at me.  And I know that he's just...  He's stealing this bus.  Oh, shit.  What are you doing with a stolen bus?  That's what I'm saying.  That's what I don't know.  So, then I was just like, fuck this shit.  And I drive away.  And he pulls away slowly and starts to drive. 
[00:25:00]  And I'm like, you know what?  I'm northbound now.  And he's behind me.  And he's like, what street?  And I'm like, we're in the 30s.  Because the woman was like, where was he before?  I'm like...  911 operators are fucking dumb.  I'm like, I know they're parallel stupid.  What do you think?  He didn't turn?  Did he tell you...  Did he order you to stop following?  Did she order you to stop following?  But she continued?  Well, then the bus turned off at some weird... 
[00:25:30]  A very quick turn off in the high 30s.  And then I was like, you know what?  He turned off.  He turned off.  I'm not following him anymore.  Oh.  We lost him.  And they were probably like, thank God.  And he probably turned into the bus depot.  Boy, would I love to hear that 911 recording.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, I was...  And Jimmy Norton.  I gave my name and everything.  Oh.  But then I'm like, what the fuck are the cops doing?  I'm like, I guess even if it was a joyride and a bus, that's not a high priority in New  York City.  I think it should be.  I do, too.  Yeah, it probably should be. 
[00:26:00]  You could slam that shit into anything.  Yeah.  So what happens?  I just drove home.  I mean, that was it.  What happens now, though?  Was there a stolen bus?  Now I need to know.  I don't know.  But I mean...  I can't believe you just gave up.  That...  I gave up.  Why would you give up at that?  I'll tell you why.  You're crime-fighting Jimmy.  You were so close to being a crime-fighter.  I had my fucking...  My little hand recorder with me.  I should have taped it and put the stuff on speaker.  About saving people.  Saving lives, Anthony.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So after you gave up on the bus, did you pull over, get a hooker, have sex in the car, 
[00:26:30]  and then beat the shit out of her with a baseball bat and take back your money?  No.  Oh, is that a Grand Theft Auto?  It sounds like you were playing GTA last night.  No, no, but I had an appointment waiting for me at home.  I love this one.  Jim Norton, apathetic crime-fighter.  You were a crime-fighter right up until you just couldn't fucking take the inconvenience.  Until I realized I was going to be late for my appointment.  Yes, that was me to be at home.  Then your priorities changed drastically.  Exactly.  Oh, that's funny.  Yeah, I had to be somewhere.  What the fuck, Jimmy? 
[00:27:00]  I would have kept following, but I just got so irritated.  Why would you pull up right next to the guy?  I wanted to see him.  What if he had a fucking shooter?  Oh, boy.  I thought of that, but I'm like, he's not going to start firing out the window.  He's just not.  I knew it wouldn't.  But it was definitely something shady.  Because of the way the bus was driving.  Where's this bus now?  Do not know.  Wow.  But I gave the license plate.  Can we look this up somehow?  Online?  Stolen bus.  I don't know.  I don't know how to either.  I'm just saying.  We called the MTA.  We got a lot of cop friends.  Yeah, it was a double bus. 
[00:27:30]  Was there an issue last night that Jimmy was part of, sort of?  I'll tell you what time I called.  He was almost part of this?  I'll tell you what time I called.  He almost did the right thing?  Right up until he just couldn't be bothered.  I just got annoyed.  That was why I stopped.  Of course.  Because the fucking operators are so fucking dumb.  When I said to her, she's like, where was he before?  First of all, who gives a fuck?  Right.  I'm like, he was on 10th and then 11th.  And she goes, well, they're parallel.  Oh, my God.  No, he was straddling them, you cunt.  One giant wheel.  One giant wheel.  He was going over the buildings.  Asshole.  I know.  What if the guy just didn't realize his sign was on? 
[00:28:00]  You know, the 911 thing.  That's absolutely a possibility.  He just hit it with his knee.  10th Avenue North.  10th Avenue North.  All of a sudden, a left on 57th Street.  And then southbound on 11th.  But he was erratic.  All the way down to fucking 34th.  Makes a right on 34th.  Goes all the way north on West Side Highway.  Slows down.  Sees me.  I pull ahead.  Then peel.  Absolutely not.  I thought of that.  It could have been a mistake.  No fucking way.  The bus driver pulled into some kind of depot and said, hey, man, my stupid light's on. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  And the guy goes, all right, I'll take it for a spin and try to figure it out for you.  Yeah, could you please fix this light?  Some guy's following me.  I called at 932 and then 939 again.  So I followed the bus for like eight minutes.  Damn.  Eight minutes of crime fighting.  Yeah.  That's fantastic, Jimmy.  Boy, you're committed.  I wish I would have fucking filmed it.  You could have heard the calls.  Oh, yeah.  The calls.  I'm sure.  Do you get more irritated as the call goes on?  Because I love to hear you just coming.  He's right here. 
[00:29:00]  And that would have been your viral video.  Oh, my God.  I was not some dumb trick shot basketball thing that I did.  Oh.  You fucking filming yourself as you're talking to 911 following a bus.  Fantastic.  Holy fuck.  I just didn't think of it.  Million views.  No problem.  I just didn't think.  No problem.  But it was so irritating because I really thought a crime was being committed.  And I thought I had to do something.  It was solicitation.  Jimmy really wears a lot of hats.  Oh, he does.  He wants to do the right thing sometimes. 
[00:29:30]  Oh, you are a crime fighter.  I love it.  You're like a vigilante.  Yeah.  A vigilante.  You're taking care of this city.  Paul Kersey.  Yeah, you're going to turn it to Paul Kersey.  Paul Kersey.  I'm following a bus.  Yeah.  You know he got bit by the bugs and now this is going to be his whole thing.  Oh, he's just going to go on patrol.  In the middle of the night, he's going to become a superhero.  On patrol.  Stopping buses.  Excuse me.  You have the license to be driving this, sir.  What kind of superhero do you want to be?  Do you want to be like Batman where you don't have any real special powers but you've got great gadgets? 
[00:30:00]  Ah, that's kind of good.  Or do you want to be like, I don't know.  Like Superman or.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I want to be one that stops women who are smuggling meaty vaginas.  I want to stop this infiltration of this nation of meaty vaginas by searching all these women and weeding out their giant clitorises.  I know Ronnie B is a hero almost every day, but we almost had a hero today.  Jim Rorten was almost a hero.  Jim's motto is, with great power comes a little bit of responsibility. 
[00:30:30]  As much as I really want to put into it.  Yeah, I don't know where he was going.  The best is like, we're just talking about the Yankees and out of nowhere he's like, gets all manic about his.  Crime fighter Jimmy.  Yeah, just.  Crime fighter Jimmy.  I almost forgot.  I wrote down, follow bus.  Oh, you should have had some of future Jimmy's gadgets.  You could have gotten them that way.  Could have communicated through your head internet.  Yeah.  Yes, in the future we will just touch the back of the bus and it will be home.  Wow, that is really funny. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, that's fan-fucking-tastic.  Yeah, I wish I had done what that is right there.  Well, the word has, there's people begging for an animation of this.  Oh my God.  Oh my God, that would be so, I could just picture it.  I just gave up though.  That's the best part.  The second it got a little too inconvenient and.  Did it get tuckered out?  I was annoyed and I really had to be home.  Yeah.  I had a young lady friend meeting me.  Oh my God.  They're calling you Slouch Man.  Slouch Man. 
[00:31:30]  Slouch Man.  Actually, that's Kevin from Connecticut.  No, we need, we need this on a record so you can just, not a fade out.  It doesn't work the same.  You're obviously just wrecking.  I'll need that.  He almost gets motivated.  Yeah.  He's almost there.  Oh my God.  That guy stole that fucking bus. 
[00:32:00]  I will listen to the replay today and I rarely do just to hear that.  Oh yeah, yeah.  Because it just came out of nowhere.  I'm like, what the fuck's going on?  I'm looking at it.  What?  It's fantastic.  What happened?  I just love the non-committal, the whole fucking, just.  You put in all the work.  Why would you stop at that point?  You're there.  You're in the middle of it.  I know.  I just got so annoyed with the fact, with their apathy and their inability.  Because the 911 operators, I'm following the bus.  It's like, all right, thank you.  And I'm like, why would you get on?  I'm like, why don't you, I'll just stay on the phone with you and let you, and give  you an update to where he was going. 
[00:32:30]  Like, I just didn't like the way they handled it.  What the dumb.  You had here a citizen willing to be on the phone.  She could have called the squad car.  Good citizen is following northbound.  You?  I bet you.  You just pictured what it's like in the movies.  Right, right.  Like, somebody does that.  Instantly, like, five cop cars come swooping in.  You're part of the big chase.  Like, you're watching it.  Like, yeah.  Yeah.  All right. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah, left.  On the 10th.  Here we go.  We're going to West Side Highway.  He's going very slow.  Woo!  And then all of a sudden, like, fucking cops are swarming.  You're part of the chase.  They're saluting you through their fucking windows.  Yeah.  And it's not every day an ordinary citizen does what he does.  Well, speaking of her honor, it brings me into the mayor.  Frank Carr in Jersey.  If there's trouble, Bloomberg shines a big light with a picture of a transgender person  into the sky.  It's just this female form of long hair and a big silhouette of a cock. 
[00:33:30]  Jimmy looks up and goes, ooh.  I would not respond well to that.  I bet you there was a big misunderstanding there.  I bet you the light was on.  I bet you that happens a lot.  Some maintenance guy is like, all right, I have to actually drive the bus to figure  it out.  I don't know.  And then all of a sudden, he sees this car fucking following him.  He's like, what the fuck?  Is this car following me?  I'm going to take a ride.  Yeah, I think he might be.  Oh, my God.  No, a maintenance guy would have...  And then he gets pissed because that's why he slows all the way down.  Like, can I fucking help you?  I'm trying to just do my job here, sir.  Oh, Jimmy. 
[00:34:00]  Maybe it was a maintenance man.  Maybe it was.  But he looked too shady, man.  Because I don't know where you would bring one of these buses after you have your little  fun with the joyride.  I don't know.  Yeah, what possible motive could you have for stealing one of those double city buses?  I don't think you could bring it to some fucking pawn shop.  A pawn shop, yeah.  A pawn shop or something.  Maybe he has a big garage at home.  He wants to park it.  What would you do with it?  You can't melt it down for the precious metals.  And a joyride is just...  Well, obviously, it is good to take a joyride because no cops are going to stop you if 
[00:34:30]  somebody calls 911.  Maybe he was just practicing.  Yeah, maybe the fucking button was broken.  I think there's probably a very simple answer here.  Tonight on Wildest Police Chases.  Oh, man.  A man with erection difficulties follows a maintenance worker for nine minutes.  No one gives a shit.  Now they're calling you Captain Try-A-Little.  Keith MC from Boston. 
[00:35:00]  Captain Try-A-Little.  Oh, my God.  I love it.  Yeah.  That was enough.  Yeah.  Yeah, there you go.  So he gave pursuit.  Yeah.  All right.  I just love how it came out of nowhere.  Yeah, I just...  And went nowhere.  It went zero.  Oh, it's great.  You just gave up.  I just went home.  I'm calling off the pursuit.  I just went home and did things that would bother a lot of religious people. 
[00:35:30]  Good news, by the way.  I think we got something to repurpose finally.  Oh, yeah.  If we don't repurpose that audio, we're not doing our jobs.  Then you don't even know what repurposing is all about.  I say we do a little Jacktober right now.  Jacktober.  What do you say?  Oh, yeah, please.  Who do we got today?  We could start it off before the break.  Who's in the barrel today?  You want to do Jacktober?  Yes.  Let's do the official sweeper.  Oh.  It's Jack.  It's Jack.  It's Jack.  This is awesome.  A celebration of crap-tastic radio from around this great nation of ours. 
[00:36:00]  Great.  Come on, guys.  Thank you.  So turn up this turntacular radio.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe it.  It's Jack.  Jacktober.  Jacktober.  All right.  Seems like people are really excited about Jacktober.  Yeah.  A lot of feedback yesterday.  Oh, boy.  Day one was a hit, huh?  Yep.  Oh.  Are they enjoying it?  Yep.  And then people were listening to the replay, too, because I knew when it was playing, because 
[00:36:30]  all of a sudden I got many, many requests for stations all at the same time.  And then people were pissed off because the replay was fucked up.  Yeah.  Who fucked up the replay this time?  What was wrong with the replay?  I don't know.  What is ever right about the replay?  It restarted.  The 8 p.m. Eastern replay, or 7 p.m., whatever time it started, replayed, started replaying  the first hour at the top of the second.  Like Crime Fighter James?  How does that happen?  Fantastic.  It's the info. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, it's too late?  Hold on.  How does it?  Danny ran in with your team.  I don't know.  They went to work on it.  It's not that.  It's just what you want, man.  Yeah, I just want to hear it.  This is Jimmy's theme music.  That's a crime fighter.  In a big city.  Oh, man.  He's pursuing.  There he is.  Yeah, he's on the phone.  Oh, he's coming in.  You know what, Danny? 
[00:37:30]  It's not too late.  That sums up Jimmy.  Just when it's getting good.  Oh, that's so good.  Just when it's getting good.  There's so much energy to that, and things are going to get fixed, and evil will not prevail.  See, it's all about the timing.  Oh, that's fantastic.  Oh, fuck it.  Sorry for fucking up Ted and Amy.  One more time. 
[00:38:00]  One more time.  Oh, one more time.  That was perfect.  Oh, yeah.  You can just picture how it progressed.  Yeah, here's Jimmy.  I've got to do something.  What is that?  It's like this bus was stolen.  Wait a minute.  There's going to be a crime going on.  I don't take this.  I've got it.  Oh, now he's in hot pursuit.  Jimmy in hot pursuit.  Can I go home? 
[00:38:30]  By the way, you know what's a more viral video than Sam's iPhone line video?  The Superman theme.  Who knew?  It's got like five and a half million hits.  Really?  Just for the theme?  Jesus.  Huge.  Has Sam's petered out at all?  No, it's up to four.  That's fucking funny.  Four point eight?  Wow.  Damn, man.  Holy shit.  E-bombs world.  They feature it on.  Did they watermark it and put it up there like it was there?  No shit.  Got me no hits.  They do that, right?  Well, yeah.  Why? 
[00:39:00]  Maybe they used to.  I don't even go there anymore.  To be totally honest with you, because they did it to one of my videos, and I lost my fucking  mind.  And I got a hold of some people over there, and they got a whole new staff, and they're  trying to do things differently.  That's what they told me.  And they did the right thing by me.  Because they've been known in the viral video world to steal everyone's shit.  Yeah, I mean, they've been around.  The guys I talked to said, look, we are a whole new fucking organization.  We fired a lot of people, and we're doing the right thing now.  And they did.  They turned around and then, you know, made it right by me.  So, so I don't have any, any, uh, bad, uh, bad, uh, bad, uh, bad, uh, bad, uh, bad, 
[00:39:30]  uh, bad, uh, anyway, e-bombs world did a real or fake with your video, Sam.  A lot of people think it's fake, but it's not.  It's crazy.  It's so real.  They decided that it's fake.  It's fine.  They decided, I guess.  Find the clip.  e-bombs world.  They decided, Ant, that it was fake.  Yeah.  And we all know it was real.  Of course it's real.  It's so fucking frustrating, this stupid internet.  How do you, how do you tell them, no, idiots, it was real? 
[00:40:00]  All that does is, uh, destroy e-bombs world's credibility.  E-bomb.  Yeah, they do this segment where they look at a bunch of videos and they decide if they're  real or fake.  You know the one with the reporter getting electrocuted by the, uh, lightning?  Oh, man.  They decided that one was fake, too.  Fake?  Did we play that one on our show?  Fake, fake, totally fake?  There's real or fake.  Huh?  I don't know where it is on their site.  All right, whatever.  Thank you, Danny, for the, uh...  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God, that's fucking brilliant.  Yeah, really, really fucking...  I love that. 
[00:40:30]  That's exactly, exactly what was needed.  Yeah.  That was great.  All right, we'll play that after the break.  We'll start with October.  So who are we featuring today?  Sam Roberts.  Going to Syracuse, New York.  Ah.  The home of...  Scorch.  At one point, yes.  At one point.  Well, of course.  Scorch has been...  And the Orange Men?  The Orange.  They used to be called the Red Men?  They used to be the Orange Men.  Now they're the Orange. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, really?  Oh, were they the Red Men?  I don't know when they were...  What was the problem with the Orange Men?  It didn't make room for the female teams.  Oh, no.  That's what the men was on?  Really?  Yeah, I was at school there when they changed from the Orange Men to the Orange.  Jesus.  Did they name their sports teams after a...  Engines?  You know what I love about the Redskins?  They're like, fuck you PC assholes.  They've been the Washington Redskins since forever. 
[00:41:30]  The Braves, too.  And they're hanging in there.  And man, there's people protesting.  They're upping their protests.  And the PC police there want them to change their names.  They don't care.  And they're like, fuck you, no.  It's one of the few politically correct things I agree with.  Oh, my goodness.  Yep.  Only because I saw American Indians explain themselves.  And it made sense to me what they said.  No, you know what it is.  Jimmy is all for the downtrodden.  The people that need help.  I fight for those that can't fight for themselves. 
[00:42:00]  I felt that if there's justice needs to be served...  Justice needs to be served.  Yes.  Or maybe not justice.  Maybe some is and some something else.  But where are these American Indians?  I saw an American Indian once when I went to the Grand Canyon.  Yeah?  They work in the cafeteria.  Well, you probably see them all the time.  They get the locals up there to work.  They don't all wear feather headdresses and moccasins.  I haven't seen any.  Yeah.  Who's offended by this?  Are they really offended by this?  I don't think so.  No, they are.  I saw them talk about it. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, it's weird.  And they've gotten the shit beat out of them here.  They've gotten treated terrible.  Yeah.  And they just don't have a powerful enough political...  I wouldn't mind it at all if one of these fucking faggot NFL teams would do it with blacks.  Or would do it with Jews.  Oh, boy.  I mean, let's go.  You want to do that?  Do it with fucking Jews.  Call a team of the fucking kikes.  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, my God.  Because redskin is a fucking...  The guy explained that redskins was a term used that that's how many Indian bodies were  in a cart.  Like, you have to...  X amount of redskins.  That was a reference to a pile of bodies. 
[00:43:00]  Really?  Yeah.  Wow.  But if you try it the other way, it would never happen.  But it's supposedly a powerful thing.  So when you have a sports team that wants to say, look, we'll kick your ass.  We're powerful.  Right.  They put an Indian name to it because they were known to be, you know, fierce fighters.  They're not trying to tell the world we got a weak team.  Oh, I know.  That loses.  We're the strong.  If you name it after the Jews, it's going to be like, how many...  Oh, I don't know.  The Braves. 
[00:43:30]  How about you fucking dumb Braves fans?  I mean, that technically was a part of their culture.  Yell fucking Allah Akbar.  Oh, boy.  Do that shit.  Oh, that would be great.  They won't do it.  Fuck them.  The stadium just runs home scared.  It's a terrorist attack.  It's one of the very, very few PC things that I think that they're actually on the right  side of.  You've got to cause he's behind.  Yeah.  For another, what, four minutes?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Believe me.  I love that story.  Don't make me play your theme.  I love that story.  Don't make me play this, Jimmy. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, God.  Are you going to peter out on your point?  No.  You know, I just think that the...  The downtrod.  I don't like the fact that the American Indians have gotten fucking...  They've been treated horribly.  Everybody knows how terribly they've been treated.  And every other group has kind of come through that to the other side.  You're there for them.  I just don't like the fact that they're being cartoon.  And they don't like the fact that they're being cartoon.  And they said that these team names have meanings that most people don't understand.  And fuck them. 
[00:44:30]  Fuck them.  I'm busy.  I'm busy.  I'm late.  I'm late for my date.  The whole half-assed crime fighter.  You're half-assed.  Yes, I am.  You could be bothered for eight minutes.  Any more than that, Jimmy.  He's like, no.  No, thank you.  That's like his limit.  Like, that's his kryptonite.  Right.  Is Jimmy can only be concerned for eight minutes at a time as a superhero.  Some little kid is being held hostage on a corner somewhere. 
[00:45:00]  He's good for eight minutes.  Eight minutes.  You better get there in eight minutes or he's going home.  Quick, get me a cape.  And his power needs recharging by some manual release.  Da-da-da!  Little finger in the rectum.  All of a sudden, my battery charges.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  Where are we?  Are we going to do a little...  We should break first, I guess.  Yeah, all right.  Yeah.  I've got to take a dumpski.  All right.  We'll do Jack Tober when we get back.  Oh, right.  It's...  Yeah, we don't have to say anything more. 
[00:45:30]  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  You find that thing?  That's what I was thinking, Sam.  Where is it?  Huh?  Where is it?  I don't know.  It's a feature.  I'll find it for you.  Okay.  It's called Real or Fake on E-Bomb's World.  Right This Minute or something like that is the name of the show.  And they do a feature within the show.  Oh.  So.  All right.  We'll do it after the break.  The OPNHL.  On Sirius XM.  And now, 88 seconds of former Minnesota governor, professional wrestler, and Navy SEAL, Jesse 
[00:46:00]  Ventura, talking crazy.  And go.  Were they testing out HAARP?  And it created this tsunami that later killed hundreds and thousands of people?  Ah!  Ah!  They have such power.  Our president goes to it, and our president has to sign a no-talk thing.  And the real guy is this character called Maurice Strong.  That's the big point.  What if it is?  No.  Say that.  No.  Terrorist.  No. 
[00:46:30]  It shows how they could shoot these things down to masses of people and literally affect  your emotions with them.  They can cause you anxiety.  They can cause you fear.  And that was on the night that Jesus Christ supposedly rose from the dead.  Both.  Both.  Really?  Both.  Yep.  With this satellite, if they want to, they can follow you and know right where you're  at.  It's eye-opening.  I don't do computers.  I'm computer illiterate, happily.  Probably.  But trust me, you know, I can do you in and not think twice about it. 
[00:47:00]  Oswald couldn't make the shots.  You know that as well as I do.  This thing's set up on the same frequency as the human brain.  Do you think that's by happenstance or by design?  Why would everything have to be locked up in national security for 50 years?  That's because you're not seeing the real medical evidence.  Could that be part of it, that they're heating up the ionosphere up there by using this thing?  Ford changed where the bullet hit.  They put him in the MRI and the machine went ballistic.  You know why?  Five chips in his body. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That was 88 seconds.  The former Minnesota governor, professional wrestler, and Navy SEAL Jesse Ventura talking  crazy.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  On the Opie and Anthony Show.  News of the world.  Opie and Anthony.  Hollywood radio show to the stars.  Silver screen heavy hitter Donald Sutherland was on the Opie and Anthony Show and had a ball.  Jesus, this is the most depressing show.  I feel totally alienated.  And you actually have listeners. 
[00:48:00]  Mr. Movie Magic Donald Sutherland told all.  He was more starstruck by both the Opie and Anthony fellas than they of him.  When I came in here, I was terrified.  Absolutely terrified.  Who booked me into this show?  Donald, Donald, before you leave us, tell us, please.  Did you have fun with Opie and Anthony?  Did I have fun here?  Oh, I'm so happy it's finished.  Stay tuned as News of the World continues to take an inside look at the lives of silver  screen studs and starlets on Opie and Anthony, Hollywood radio show to the stars. 
[00:48:30]  Sirius XM.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show.  We'll be right back. 
[00:49:00]  We'll be right back.  Oh!  We'll do Jack Tober in a minute or two.  But we found the video from E-Bombs World.  These guys do a show called, uh, what's the name of the show?  The show is called Real or Fake. 
[00:49:30]  No, it's not.  Yeah, it is.  No, it's not.  And it's actually from the website Right This Minute.  Right This Minute is the name of the show, and they do a feature within their show called  Real or Fake.  Yeah.  Sam.  Uh-huh.  Dummy.  The video's called Real or Fake, and the website's called Right This Minute.  Yeah.  So this is the feature on their show called Real or Fake.  No, the website is Right This Minute.  Right.  Right This Minute.  Right.  That's the name of their show.  Website.  No, they would call their website Real or Fake, then. 
[00:50:00]  They have different segments on their website.  No.  Yes, they do.  I've seen the show many times.  All right.  The show's called Right This Minute.  Okay.  And then they're like, you know what?  One of our feature's called Real or Fake, and we look at three videos.  And they just make a video of just the segment?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's how they get their shit out there.  So Sam's video was featured on a show called Right This Minute.  Yeah, Real or Fake.  And the segment is called Real or Fake.  Just play this thing. 
[00:50:30]  Do you want to hear the first video, too?  Yeah, because it's one we didn't really show on the show, but there's, I don't know, I  think it's Russia, one of those fucking countries, and there's a reporter, and all of a sudden  he gets struck by lightning.  Yeah, Real or Fake.  Did you see that video?  Yeah.  It looked like they were in a cemetery or something like that?  Yeah, I think fake.  You always thought fake, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah, fake.  Pretty impressive, then.  Fake, fake, totally fake.  Leave it to the jury.  We're going to get right to it with our first video, where Porter gets struck. 
[00:51:00]  Oh.  What just happened?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  I think it's fake.  I want to go with fake, too.  I want to go with real.  Mm-mm.  I might say fake, too.  Maybe the next trailer for the next Exorcist movie or something.  Why would that be the Exorcist?  It was so perfectly framed up in the background.  I think this is real.  What do you think, Mac?  I'm going to call shenanigans on this one.  I think the setup was all there.  Not real. 
[00:51:30]  Fake.  Man.  Next video, waiting for an iPhone 5.  What are you planning on using it for?  Texting, um, messages to my friends.  What influenced you to get on this line, then?  Like, everybody else that's waiting in line, we're just, like, really wanting to buy Apple  Phone 5, and we want our phones now.  This is a total plan.  This was totally set up.  I think it's real.  Remember, she was talking about your hair.  It's a total plan. 
[00:52:00]  Because even what else is, it's the cool thing to do, Gail.  It's mob mentality.  I think she's real, too.  Yeah, fake.  Hey.  You're sitting in a leather office chair.  Man, I really thought this was real, but you guys may have convinced me that it's fake.  What convinced you?  I think the office chair factor is interesting.  I'm going to say this is fake.  I'm going with you guys.  Thank you.  Absolutely.  Oh, man, dude.  He's wearing sunglasses and a backwards hat.  But he's right, though. 
[00:52:30]  He's inside.  You're saying he's cool?  No.  That guy is very cool on Skype.  I'm saying his coolness is fake.  They're supposed to be experts on viral videos.  Yeah, yeah, that pretty much...  How stupid are they?  That discredits him right there.  You can't believe anything.  There's no such thing as experts on viral videos.  And if you're...  True.  And if you're going to fake a video, why would you bring an office chair?  No, it doesn't make any sense.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  When you're overthinking and go, well, shit, she's got to be kind of sitting on the fucking  sidewalk.  She's so unbelievable that it has to be real, because if it was fake, then it would be so 
[00:53:00]  fake.  Why would you fuck up your fake video by having a comfy office chair for the, quote, fake  person planted on the line?  If you tried to fake it, you would make it look a lot more real, I guess.  Or at least be like, hey, what are you doing in that office chair?  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, what have you got the office chair for?  Like I wrote in a little joke about the office chair for her.  I think it's fake.  You do?  I do think it's fake.  I agree with them.  Good one.  I can guarantee you that they are incorrect. 
[00:53:30]  Oh, man.  Maybe they should go out to an iPhone line and make a viral video.  Well, or make a real one.  It would be nice to see someone do that.  I know Sam, and I know the whole setup, and I know the girls, so whatever.  Jimmy, I'm really thinking she is, like, hilarious now.  Like, at first, it was just she was annoying, and you're kind of like, ick by her, and yet  now it's just, um, uh, Apple, uh, phone five?  Yeah.  I, uh, it's, now it's just hilarious. 
[00:54:00]  Can we get her on the show?  No.  I wish you could find her now.  She hasn't responded to emails.  Oh, this is very suspicious.  What emails?  Are you pulling one over on us?  Oh, man.  Yes, I'm pulling one over.  No, I'm not pulling one over.  Where'd you get her?  Was she an actress?  She was online for an iPhone.  Right, right, right.  No, no, I got it.  What's this about?  Can we withdraw views from a video to get, you know, put them back down?  There's a new view program where you can get something up to a million views.  Oh, that's gotta be good. 
[00:54:30]  It's viewed by bots.  Ah, bots?  Ah, bots.  Is that like a street view?  No, bots are fake views.  Oh.  Ah, they take fake views very seriously.  That's got 400 real views.  Yeah, that's it.  That's it.  Why can't we get her on the show?  She knows, like, she's...  Does she?  ...a star of this video by now.  How does she know that?  She doesn't know what an iPhone is.  Yeah, I guess you're right.  She's confused by the internet.  Yeah, no.  Somebody might have told her.  Hey, you look retarded in this video.  We gotta get her on the show. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah, I would love to.  But I don't think there's much motivating her, too.  If she has been made aware of the video, it's probably in a negative context.  Yeah.  What do you mean emails?  You got some kind of address on her?  She sent me...  I think it was her.  Somebody claiming to be her, anyway.  Oh, no.  Sent me an email asking if there was any video of her from the iPhone line.  Yes, I got an email from her.  She's in Australia.  Boo.  Yes.  Boo. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, that's ghoulish.  That's creepy.  Yes.  Yes.  Boo.  Ebenezer Scrooge.  And then the watermark comes onto your video, proving I was there.  Oh, Steve.  Oh, Steve.  Oh, Steve.  Yes, get the Ouija board.  Talk to me.  Oh, Steve.  G- 
[00:56:00]  B-E-A-R.  See?  It's a big bear.  It's getting her in studio.  Someone knows her.  Well, yeah, come on.  I emailed her back and said, yes, I have some video.  I'll send you a link later this afternoon.  What's your contact information?  I'd love to get you on the phone or talk to you on the air or even shoot another video  or something.  What's your Apple phone five number?  Right.  Yeah.  But I never heard back. 
[00:56:30]  Well, write her again, stupid.  Write her again.  Yeah, what the fuck?  Days ago.  What's wrong with you?  Let's write her again.  Okay.  We got to get her on the show.  Who is this bitch?  Oh, but I'd love to get her on the show.  All right.  We got to do Jack Tober.  People are mad.  Jack Tober.  They get mad.  Yeah, the people that we feature.  They're very angry.  Yesterday.  Wow.  What a success that was, huh?  Yeah.  Any updates from yesterday's show?  Is their page back up?  I'll check if their page is back up.  That was great.  That was a great kickoff to Jack Tober.  Today, we go to Syracuse.  Yes, we go to Syracuse.  For myself and Amy Shummer. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, Amy Shummer.  No, it is Ted.  And Amy.  And Amy.  Oh.  And they're on in Syracuse at 93Q.  Yes.  I love it.  What kind of station is 93Q?  It's like, I mean, it's number one hit music, but it's adult oriented.  How are they the number one hit music station?  Well, yeah, I mean, it's not even.  If you've narrowed down the demo, I'm sure they have somewhere that they're number one.  What?  There's a hit music station that just plays the number twos? 
[00:57:30]  Number one hit music station.  I hate radio slogans.  They never make sense.  God, I was in that world for way too long.  What does that mean, the number one hit music station?  They're not even the number one hit music station in Syracuse.  Oh, man.  I don't know why it says that.  There should be the radio slogan police.  And they come in and go, look, you're not number one in Syracuse.  Radio slogan police.  You can't use that one.  You can't use that one.  You're not allowed.  You're not allowed.  So Ted and Amy, they look like an older couple. 
[00:58:00]  Are they married or are they one of those radio teams where they make believe they're sort of married?  It's like a work husband and wife.  Oh, so they're not really husband and wife, but they play one on the radio.  Seems that way.  Ted Lang.  Long, I think.  That's what that says.  Long.  It's weird font.  Oh, yeah.  If I move closer, it's Ted Long.  Okay.  Ted Long.  I feel like a Ted Lang.  And Amy Robbins.  And I think they've been in Syracuse for a long time.  I kind of remember them when I was there. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, you do?  And, yeah.  When you're doing your stint.  It's very adult-oriented, number one hit music.  What?  It's kind of like adult contemporary type of...  AC?  Yeah.  They call that AC.  Oh, that's me.  But they're playing hit music?  But they're playing, like, Katy Perry and stuff.  But they're obviously not at all relating to anybody who has any youth.  They look like they're pushing about 60.  Oh, boy.  What?  That's not...  Even Amy and her highlights?  Let me see.  Oh, God.  Look at her.  Oh, God. 
[00:59:00]  She looks like E-Rock coming back from vacation.  Oh, my God.  Look at that face.  And, you know, that's the best picture she took.  Yes.  Of course.  Well, she has a bit of a big forehead.  Like an elongated forehead.  Yeah.  A bit.  Spiky hairdo.  The smile isn't very warm.  See, it looks like a lizard.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's got, like, a lizard face.  Now, guys.  All right.  Today...  Oh, no.  Is her bio good?  Do you want to learn about her a little bit?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, wow.  Do you know what her friends call her?  What?  I know what I would call her if I was her friend. 
[00:59:30]  They call her the Amster.  Ooh.  Whoa.  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Yeah.  Someone's going to have a problem with that.  Aimless.  Some of them.  Amy, aimless.  The Amster?  The Amster.  As in the Opster?  As in the Opster.  Son of a bitch.  Favorite food?  I love any kind of soup.  Ew.  Wow.  How fucking...  Ugh.  Who loves soup?  I'm a bland person. 
[01:00:00]  You know what?  Every once in a while, I'll enjoy a bowl of soup, but I would never put it on my bio.  No.  No, it's not even my favorite hot liquid food in a bowl.  A soup isn't even considered a meal.  Oh, look at the lotto thing.  It's got a Mendy's.  First thing you do if you win the lottery, pay off all my bills and build a greenhouse.  It's a house that's green with envy.  Oh, that's very good shit.  And then launch yourself through the roof like Tony Rocky Hara. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, my.  Best on-air experience?  Uh-oh.  It's got to be creating Amy's Slumber Party, which now draws 1,900 women for two sold-out  nights every February.  It's probably been my most successful event ever.  She has a slumber party?  Amy's Slumber Party.  And how many people show up?  900 over two days.  Great.  What do they do?  Oh, they sleep and girl talk.  Do they eat box?  Yeah.  A lot of box eating, you think? 
[01:01:00]  They sit there sweating from their menopausal hot flashes.  I think there's box eating.  Box eating.  Yeah.  Box.  They wear their special PJs.  Watch out.  They're guilty pleasure.  Oops, there's a hole in my PJs.  What?  The real housewives of anywhere.  Yeah.  That means you can't pick a real housewives that she likes? 
[01:01:30]  I personally like the New Jersey housewives.  That's your preference?  Yeah, they're all fucked up.  And in this sentence is the hole.  Okay.  Expression you use the most.  Give me some coffee, sir.  That's enough, Ted.  No.  That's the expression she uses the most.  No.  That's enough, Ted.  Wow.  Man, people just don't get the whole thing.  That's enough, Ted.  That's enough, Ted.  The fake outrage, like you might be going a little too far.  Oh, that's enough, Ted.  Unless Ted is a giant cock, and he likes to fuck her bottom. 
[01:02:00]  And he goes, you want more?  And she says, that's enough, Ted.  That just goes to show our differences.  I was thinking when it just hits her cervix, like that's enough, Ted.  But you went right for the ass.  Yeah.  Love it.  But I hope that's why she uses it.  Oh, yeah.  That's enough, Ted.  Yeah.  Pulls his dick out.  Come at her during the show.  Pulls his dick out like a fucking oil dipstick.  See how far up the shaft this shit is.  You're about a quart low.  Why aren't you reading The Most Embarrassing Moment? 
[01:02:30]  I don't know.  Where is it?  Or The Best Time of Year.  I mean, these are all terrific answers.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Most Embarrassing Moment is embarrassing.  It's crazy.  It's not good.  When I asked one of our listeners if it was her daughter that was with her, and it was  actually her sister, her twin sister.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Embarrassing. 
[01:03:00]  Oh, boy.  Best time of the year for you?  Best time.  I love spring.  Such a good feeling when you have all that nice weather still to come.  That's enough, Ted.  That's enough, Ted.  She loves powdered peanut butter.  What's powdered peanut butter?  What is that?  I curse the day I was introduced to this because now I can't live without it.  Greek yogurt and powdered peanut butter.  Greek yogurt.  All right, of course.  Throat yogurt.  Eat it out of an ass. 
[01:03:30]  Now I got to try the powdered peanut butter.  You going to give it a try?  It's easier to sprinkle on your pussy and let your dog fucking lick it off.  By the way, here's the weirdest job-related experience.  When some guy followed me into a woman's restroom to get my autograph.  No.  He followed you in there to rape you.  When he realized there was somebody else, he pulled out a pen.  Hey, sign this.  Stupid.  Anything else there?  No.  That's about it.  So why don't we get into their show? 
[01:04:00]  I like that you're going to try the powdered peanut butter because the Amster recommended it.  Yeah.  I never knew you could do such a thing.  That's enough, Ted.  All right, so it's Jocktober, show number two, Ted and Amy on 93Q in Syracuse.  Let's take a listen.  All right.  Too early to be wide awake?  Come on, you're getting up at like four after three these days.  I think of you when I get up and I think, boy, Ted has turned over a new leaf.  Yeah, I know. 
[01:04:30]  I do get up early.  Although I don't think I have an incentive to anymore.  Have you heard the big news?  You know, don't even start with me.  What is the...  Oh, my God.  Why is this on the radio?  Yuck.  Horrendous.  Don't even start with me.  Imagine having to live with that.  Is that his wife or no?  No, it's not.  It sounds like it.  No.  It's, you know, in radio, some of these guys have two wives.  Their actual wife.  And then they got another, like, fucking radio wife.  So they got to deal with that shit twice.  Did you miss the cleverness of how they came into that break? 
[01:05:00]  You understand that song was called Wide Awake, don't you?  Oh.  And he was yawning like, no, I'm not wide awake, though.  I'm not.  I didn't catch that.  That's right.  And then Amy even had the smarts to say, what is it, too early for you to be wide?  Oh, wait.  Whoa.  I got it.  I like when a jock sneaks the title of the song into what they're talking about.  You like that.  I kind of like it.  That's your thing.  Yeah.  Kind of nice.  Oh, boy.  I don't think I have an incentive to anymore.  Have you heard the big news?  You know, don't even start with me. 
[01:05:30]  What is the deal that this global shortage of bacon made all the headlines yesterday?  There's apparently...  Wow.  Is she reading that?  What kind of segue is that?  But what a terrible thing to think about, much less talk about.  Oh.  Oh.  Look at poor Iraq sitting there wincing, waiting for the joke.  I know.  He's just crushed by that news.  Iraq, you heard there was a bacon shortage?  Hmm.  I saw this story days ago.  I'm like, there's no reason to bring this up on our show.  Right. 
[01:06:00]  Cares.  Every time.  It's perfect for a morning zoo type show.  Yeah.  When you heard there was a bacon shortage, did you get nervous whenever you saw someone  with a knife?  Oh, God damn it.  This is...  I don't know what they're into, but this is Ted and Amy's Facebook page.  Oh, no.  This is what their listeners are posting.  Why is a horse up another...  My Little Pony up a horse's ass.  A horse's ass.  That's gross.  I don't know what these...  Oh, that's just a picture of shit. 
[01:06:30]  I don't know what these guys do with their listeners.  Oh, that's gross.  Let's find out about the bacon shortage.  Is the deal that this global shortage of bacon made all the headlines yesterday?  There's apparently a shortage of...  Is it really that big of a deal?  Well, if you're a bacon lover, yeah it is.  Oh, my God.  What's even the reason to get up in the morning if you don't have bacon?  They're covering it, I mean, everywhere from, you know, Today Show to MSN to all this kind  of stuff, the global, which the global bacon shortage also means a global ham shortage, 
[01:07:00]  global pork shortage as well.  Is there a global pig shortage?  What's the problem?  Well, here's the deal.  No, you're working with one.  It's not because of the drought.  It's all because the world didn't get as much water as they normally do, and so that has  been raising up...  So we've got to pay the price?  I blame all the state fairs that put bacon on everything.  Oh, I know.  Bacon was so big, that chocolate-covered bacon.  Sticking bacon and ice cream now.  I mean, again, I'm a BLT lover from way back then.  I just...  It makes you want to scream. 
[01:07:30]  You know who smiles and...  You know who looks at the radio and smiles and nods while she's knitting to this?  The competition.  This is like something Jean Lundergaard would love when she's watching that dumb show Good  Morning fucking Brainerd or whatever it was, and she's like knitting and smiling at their  dumb banter.  That's who likes this.  Wow.  Jean Lundergaard.  Wow.  Yeah, but you stopped halfway.  That's not cool.  They weren't done making their point about the bacon.  Okay, fair enough.  They, she, ugh, I can't. 
[01:08:00]  Well, you don't...  You have to relate to the listeners, because when you first hear there's a bacon shortage,  at first you'll go, ah, big deal.  But then when they start relating it to all the different ways one might eat bacon, you  start to think, oh, this really does affect me.  We're all affected.  Yeah, that's exactly right.  And then we're all affected by the bacon shortage.  I'm not Opster right now.  My bad.  Chocolate-covered bacon?  Is she a bacon and ice cream now?  Well, I mean, again, I, you know, I'm a BLT lover from way back, but I just could not  believe that everywhere I turned to yesterday, this was in the top three headlines. 
[01:08:30]  Mm-hmm.  Really a global bacon shortage?  Bacon shortage.  So I guess, yeah, they're cutting down on the pigs, which means we're cutting down on  all the pork.  And who's laughing now?  Huh?  Because everything I eat is turkey.  Oh, that's true.  Turkey ham.  Turkey bacon.  There's an overabundance of turkey bacon.  Turkey bacon.  I don't have to go anywhere, because guess what?  I'm already there.  Oh, man!  I'm not happy with this news.  Women have no business being on the radio. 
[01:09:00]  And why did you get so excited?  Nate Hughes, man.  Yes.  You know how they do the whole female comic thing?  We're way past that.  There's a lot of fucking funny female comics.  Prove to me there's a good fucking female radio host.  Yeah.  Holy shit!  Man, you're right.  That proved to me.  Was angering.  Yeah, I mean, Ted was all pissed.  Ted had a lap band.  Yeah, his whole thing has been losing weight. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, good for him.  They have, by the way.  Ditch's sidekick.  Yeah, he would lose about 180, it looks like.  We've played one clip from the show.  And we've passed phase one, where the public posting is no longer allowed on their Facebook.  Wow, that was fast.  Because we gave their name.  We gave them too much time.  Yeah.  Because then we got distracted and did other things.  Oh, no.  Tomorrow, if we give the name, we've got to go right for them.  As a matter of fact, Paul Hargis has already commented on one of their photos. 
[01:10:00]  Oh.  Phase two, bitches.  Phase two, bitches.  That's great.  Oh, boy.  You want more from Ted and Amy?  Yeah, I'm enjoying them.  93 Q in Syracuse.  The number one hit music station.  I think I could do that for a living.  Oh, yeah.  Well, what do you think about?  I could do radio songs for a living.  What do you think about bacon?  What do you mean?  Yeah.  Give us a little bacon break.  Yeah.  No, no. 
[01:10:30]  I just do the, I just do the, I'm just the voice of the station.  No, you got it.  You got it.  Nope.  Oh.  Nope.  Come on now.  Come on.  The Opster did a bacon video.  Is that right?  What?  The bacon Sunday video is doing pretty good.  That's enough, Ted.  It's time to play.  Line them up.  Yes.  And guess what?  Guess what?  It's got a blank theme.  Kind of.  Kind of.  Oh, really?  I'm confused.  Yeah, she, uh.  They're going to go with the bacon thing a little longer. 
[01:11:00]  Oh, God.  Amy tried to relate.  It was working well.  We know.  Was it?  Yeah.  We know better than anyone.  If something's working, you go with it.  You stick with it.  That's true.  You keep going.  And you tell.  You hammer the point home.  You tell me after listening to this, if the bacon theme was worth the stretch it took  to make this work.  Oh, no.  So far, it's good.  You like it.  Also, people are, one guy's pointing out, Chris in Tampa, repeating the joke, Ant, is in full  effect today.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I just did it.  Did you? 
[01:11:30]  Yeah, just before.  Why do you tell people what your crutch is?  I realize what I did, because that's the best way to break it, because now I'm conscious  of it, so I try not to do it.  Yeah.  Bear with me, people.  Bear with me.  I've wanted to say howl four times today.  I'll be honest.  I'll be honest.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I've wanted to four times.  It's very hard to break the habit, so I'm trying.  I'm actually biting my own fucking, fucking lip to stop that one.  Because the people demand it.  They demand the opster stop saying howling.  Opster.  See, I just did it.  The opster.  All right, here's the line-em-up bit they do up there in Syracuse on the Ted and Amy 
[01:12:00]  show.  Oh, beautiful time of year to drive out to Critz Farns.  I know.  We were just discussing.  We've got to go leaf peeping before it's too late, you know?  Better do it quick.  All right, that's what you're playing for, Caller 10.  You need to line these three things up in this order.  I'm not quite sure where I got it.  I was going to go with a ham theme.  Oh, with the whole bacon shortage?  With the bacon shortage, and then I just couldn't find anything that was a ham theme, so I thought  of Green Eggs and Ham, the Dr. Seuss book. 
[01:12:30]  All right.  You've got to follow me on lining up these Dr. Seuss books in chronological order, like  when they were written.  Which came earliest?  Which came latest?  Green Eggs and Ham.  Green Eggs and Ham.  Cat in the Hat.  Cat in the Hat.  And the Lorax.  The Lorax.  Which came first?  4-2-1-9-3-9-3.  Line it up.  You win next with 93Q.  93Q.  Who the fuck cares?  My favorite book was Horton Hears a Terrible Radio Show.  Horton Hears a Hull. 
[01:13:00]  Didn't Dr. Seuss pretty much write all these books at the exact same time?  Yeah.  It seemed like it.  Who would care when the first book was written?  Dr. Seuss, he was actually partners with Mengele.  And then they went different directions.  I want to write children's book.  Well, I want to get two of each and torture them.  All right.  Take care.  I'm reading a lot of children's books these days.  I fucking hate Dr. Seuss.  They're stupid.  They're stupid books.  You're mad because you don't know which one was written first.  I don't give a fuck.  And you're not going to get to go leaf peeping.  Dr. Steve Seuss. 
[01:13:30]  I would not eat that tumescent boner.  I would not eat it.  Steve, I am.  Yeah.  Green eggs and wine.  Green wine and ham.  I would not drain that fluid on a boat.  I would not drain that fluid in a moat.  Yeah.  I would not drain that viscous fluid.  I'm a man, not a druid.  I will not search inside your colon.  But I will gladly take you both bowling. 
[01:14:00]  Nice.  I smell bit.  Sam, I am.  Put your dick in my can.  You know, too messin'.  Too messin'.  Flood.  Do we find the answer to line them up?  Well, you're anxious for it, aren't you?  Yes.  By the way, people are leaving Terry Clifford-related comments on their Facebook page.  What do you mean?  You know, Terry Clifford.  From the B-Morning Coffee Club, who has yet to be featured this year. 
[01:14:30]  What are they saying to these people?  Well, have you ever seen Baby Adolf?  The picture?  Oh, yeah.  It's adorable.  You've seen it?  Yeah.  It was one of the, I suppose it's one of the greatest fake pictures ever.  Yeah?  Yeah, I was on a website yesterday.  They were talking about all these fake pictures, photoshops, from way, way back in the day.  The day.  Like, one guy was just standing there, and then they had hands behind him, but nothing else.  So, supposedly, that was a ghost holding this person, and everyone bought into it.  Yeah, way back in the day.  But they also had Baby Adolf.  Baby Hitler is great. 
[01:15:00]  Or Baby Hitler.  Yeah.  And a lot of people swore that was Hitler's kid, but it's so obvious, it's not even possible.  Could you just fucking Google image Baby Adolf?  Oh, it's so...  Or Baby Hitler.  It'll pop right up.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, yeah.  I've never seen this one.  Really?  I'm behind on this one.  Oh, it's adorable.  Look at it.  No, that's not the one, though.  Oh, that's the famous one.  That's the one.  Really?  This is something they actually put out there in the day.  That one?  Nope.  Oh, he's adorable.  Those are the ones, though, with the little... 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, I'll show you the one I saw.  I'll show you during the break.  I'm the Lindbergh baby.  We've got to get to the answer of line of mouth.  Here's Ted and Amy.  It's Jocktober, everyone.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Come on.  Let's do this.  All right.  They open the door.  Ted and Amy.  Ted and Amy in the morning.  93Q.  627 with Ted and Amy.  We have Pam on the line all set to line it up.  How you doing, Pam?  Good morning.  Good.  How are you?  I'm doing well.  I thought Pam's name was Sam, and I thought that...  Isn't Sam I am? 
[01:16:00]  Isn't that like part of a Dr. Seuss thing?  That's part of Green Eggs and Ham.  I thought that was going to be very appropriate.  No.  Her name is Pam.  You let me down, Pam.  Can I call you, Sam?  My daughter's Sam.  Well, there you go.  Her daughter is Sam.  Okay.  Pam, line up these Dr. Seuss books in chronological order, earliest to latest.  Green Eggs and Ham, Cat in the Hat, and the Lorax.  Cat in the Hat, Green Eggs and Ham, and Lorax.  Good job, Pam.  All right.  Cat in the Hat, 1957.  Green Eggs and Ham, 1960.  And the Lorax back in 1971. 
[01:16:30]  Love all of them.  Hey, Pam, we have the season pass for you for Critt's Farms out in Cazenovia.  You and your lovely daughter, Sam, can enjoy all the fall fun out at Critt's Farms, okay?  Okay.  What does leafing mean?  What do you do?  What's that mean?  Leaf peeping.  What is leaf peeping?  Is that when you do shit in a field and you wipe your hiney with a different leaf?  I want a mint one, please.  I've been known to do that.  Leaf peep?  Yeah, you drive up into a nice little fucking country area and check out the leaves changing.  This?  Maybe have some hot apple cider. 
[01:17:00]  Ew, how about fucking-  Maybe ride a ski lift or two.  Girls restroom peeping.  Maybe go through a corn maze.  That sounds horrid.  Yeah.  And then there's a bonfire if you're staying overnight.  Like leaf peeping.  I want bush peeping.  That show is beyond terrible.  Like that is everything.  That whole break from that beginning, that Ted and Amy, that whole thing, how we popped  right in at the perfect time with the time. 
[01:17:30]  It's not terrible.  It's very polished, but it's more who gives a fuck.  Who cares?  Right.  It's who cares radio more than terrible.  And then the woman that's winning the contest, like she has no clue what to do.  I can't have a lorax.  There's all these big sound effects and everything.  And they're like, you won, okay?  And she goes, yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  She didn't win anything.  She's going to leave peeps.  She could leave peeps.  You could do that on your own.  Yeah, what the fuck?  What is she saving?  The $5 fucking parking fee?  Yep. 
[01:18:00]  Somebody wrote, that's enough, Ted.  Over and over and over and over and over under one of their pictures that they posted.  Well, why don't we do this?  Are people being nice on the Facebook page?  Somebody is obsessed with this.  He's writing, you know what would make this work better?  More bacon.  And then he's shouting, I need more bacon.  Want to do one more clip?  HIV, AIDS, herpes, syphilis repeated over and over again. 
[01:18:30]  Fuck you.  What much is that?  Fuck you.  This is unkind.  And here's a picture of some guy with his baby, which was a mistake.  It's not good.  Uncle Paul keeps commenting.  Of course, Uncle Paul.  What's he saying?  Yeah.  Paul, I get it.  Hey, sure, you do shaka shaka.  Let's play turkey foot.  Shaka shaka.  All the good ones are taken.  Lucky fella. 
[01:19:00]  Hold on, hold on.  Oh, he wrote some other stuff, too.  Jerry Sheppardini.  Chimey.  Oh, God.  Hey there, fellas.  Little game of hot potato with this one little tootsie.  Yeah, it's a lot of pedophile jokes.  Oh, boy.  Chipper.  You want another clip from this show?  Desperately.  All right.  Sam writes here, I wonder if the news story came from Pret Burger.  Yeah, you remember some of the, we talked about this yesterday, people getting their  news stories from Pret Burger. 
[01:19:30]  Do you remember the news stories at all that were covered in the show we were listening  to yesterday?  No, I forgot that show.  I couldn't even tell you the name of it at this point.  You tell, it was the bullpen.  Oh, right.  And they're, I'll tell you, and their audience is called The Herd.  That's right.  See?  Now, just listen.  And?  They feed your need for rock.  That's exactly right.  See, I remember some stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just listen to a little bit of this, and you tell me if you've heard this news story before  somewhere.  Oh, God, no.  Tell me.  Oh, no.  Oh, God, no. 
[01:20:00]  Scientists in Korea have discovered the secret to a longer life for men.  What is it?  What is it?  Who can guess?  Who can guess what it is?  Go on.  Who can guess?  Let's play a game.  Who can guess?  Holy fuck.  The opester had his hand up first.  Uh-oh.  I had it too, though.  He had his hand up first.  Oh, man.  Opening a wine bottle?  No.  No.  The secret to a longer life for men?  Yes.  Opening a wine bottle?  No.  Wrong break.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, shit. 
[01:20:30]  Cutting off your penis and balls.  The giggle berries got it.  Yeah.  The twigging giggle berries.  Oh, I went with the other fucking prep burger.  Oh, I'm sure they'll get to that eventually.  Damn it.  What?  Fuck.  We are exposing the hackadness.  Yeah.  And this was all good.  These companies are paying these morning shows, you know, decent money to just fucking go  on a prep burger service and do the jokes that someone else is writing.  Terrible.  Or picking the...  It's terrible.  They're basically picking their content for the entire morning.  I'm listening to shows like this every single day and... 
[01:21:00]  But how hard is it...  You know, I know a lot of these shows aren't on the level of us.  Oh, please.  But how hard is it to sit there in a dumb fucking city like Syracuse?  No offense, because I do like Syracuse, but I'm saying dumb.  It's a dumb city.  And then you look through your paper and you fucking, you know, read the news and come up  with shit.  Or just joke naturally.  Just talk.  Why do you have to go to some kind of dumb service for some who gives a fuck story that  might be slightly edgy?  And this isn't like hunting. 
[01:21:30]  I listened to Ted and Amy in its entirety the day after I listened to the bullpen.  And when you heard this, did you go, oh no.  Oh my god.  Oh no, it's gold.  I like to hear their take on the story, though.  Maybe they give it a unique twist.  It's all about the spin.  DJ Wedge 73, one of the regulars on my Twitter, writes,  Ted and Amy, line these things up.  Gasoline, a match, your house.  Do we have a prep burger subscription yet? 
[01:22:00]  Not yet.  We gotta get one.  Immediately.  Oh my god.  Yeah, tell the radio wizard we need that.  Uh, 93Q Chippitus says, feeds my need for shitty garbage.  All right, well, let's do this.  Scientists in Korea have discovered the secret to a longer life for men.  Ooh, okay.  Can we guess what her reaction's gonna be?  Oh.  Just to twist this a little bit?  Yeah, twist it up.  Cause they're gonna come up with the answer that it's cutting off your fucking testicles, 
[01:22:30]  I guess, or, right?  She's gonna be...  Or the whole fucking package.  The twig and giggle berries.  She's gonna be very offended by this.  She's gonna be like...  She might go with the fucking catchphrase.  What was that phrase again?  That's enough?  That's enough.  That's enough.  That's enough, Ted.  Could we possibly be hearing, that's enough, Ted, from Amy right now?  This is a little edgy.  This could get a little crazy.  And she knows what her job is.  Yeah.  The good news...  Isn't Korea where they're wearing man makeup now?  South Korea?  South Korea, but that is not...  That's not the secret to a long life? 
[01:23:00]  No.  Okay.  That's the good news.  The bad news is...  Yes?  It's castration.  Ah!  Seriously!  They found the male sex hormones are responsible for shortening a man's life.  I gotta hear that again.  I gotta hear ah, seriously?  Actually, these guys are lazy.  They didn't even like...  They got this big story.  The other show played with it a little bit and got the phones.  You want to get some phone action.  Right.  They just said, fuck it.  Let's just read the story.  Well, they got the phone action on the fucking...  Line them up.  You're right.  Line them up.  So, you know.  You don't want to steal. 
[01:23:30]  You don't want to pound that into the ground.  Ah!  Seriously!  Seriously!  I mean, seriously!  Ah!  Syracuse-ly!  Syracuse-ly, yeah.  Keep it local.  Ah!  Seriously!  They found the male sex hormones are responsible for shortening a man's life.  I really want that.  Yeah, yeah.  That is a good one to have.  I guess the intern just brought in a salad.  It has to do with no.  That's the good news.  The bad news is...  Yes, it comes to salad.  ...it's castration. 
[01:24:00]  Ah!  Seriously!  They found the male sex hormones are responsible for shortening a man's life, and they say  if you don't have those, you can live an average of 14 to 19 years longer.  Are you kidding me?  Would you want to?  I'm not sure.  But I just thought that was kind of interesting.  Yeah.  I think I'd rather die early if I had my druthers, although I'd probably have a lovely singing  voice.  And you wonder who volunteered for that research 14 to 19 years ago. 
[01:24:30]  Hey, Bob, you're castrated.  Let me do a little study on you.  Yikes.  Yeah, of course.  Yikes is...  You summed it up with a yikes, yes.  Well, if I had my druthers...  My druthers...  What's that?  I've never heard that for balls and...  My druthers?  No, no, no.  If I had my druthers...  What?  I think it's my way.  My way.  Yeah, like if I got to choose.  Like a little...  Yeah, like for balls.  Yeah, a little...  Like, oh, I kicked him in the druthers.  It's the opposite of druthers.  What's that? 
[01:25:00]  Druthers.  Oh, sisters and...  Oh, boy.  Double siblings, bitch.  And he took her thing to...  When she said, who would volunteer for that?  He took that to mean not who would volunteer to be castrated, but what castrated man who  had previously been castrated for reasons unrelated would...  He just took the humor out of an already humorless joke.  I've had it with these two already.  Requests are coming in like crazy on their Facebook.  I guess they play music, too.  Oh, nice.  One person is asking them to play some Anal Cunt. 
[01:25:30]  Hoping to hear that on 93Q in Syracuse today.  That was Anal Cunt.  I'd love to hear that one.  Yeah, people...  That's going to be offensive to those who work at the stations.  Oh, yes.  Yeah?  Yes.  One more before the break?  Please.  Jeez.  Swastikas are just...  Oh, no.  I don't know how you do that with a keyboard, but there's swastikas and music notes that say  Jerry Shepardini next to it.  Jerry Shepardini.  Look, before we rest, Jocktober, until a little later today, we've got to have the whole acting 
[01:26:00]  like a whole, don't we, guys?  Oh, please.  Please.  Wow.  It's part of the Jocktober festivities.  What has she been doing?  That's enough, Ted.  Oh, no.  She really holds it up in this next clip.  Oh, nice.  Ted and Amy on 93Q in Syracuse.  That's who we're focusing on today for Jocktober.  Yeah.  Check this out.  I don't use my cruise control.  Look.  Even if I'm on a long trip, because it takes control of my car and it kind of freaks me  out.  Well, I'm not saying, you know, don't pay attention to what's going on, but it's very cool  that you can get a car that could drive itself from point A to point B. 
[01:26:30]  Kind of like the piloting, the self-piloting, or whatever they call it for the planes, right?  Autopilot.  Autopilot.  There we go.  Although, I like this because this guy was from Cadillac, and knowing the average age  of the majority of Cadillac owners, this might not be a bad thing, especially on senior  day at the fair.  All right.  Imagine how much quicker we could get down to the fairgrounds if all the Cadillacs could  drive themselves.  Does that mean in terms of speed as well?  I think so.  I think so.  I don't know. 
[01:27:00]  I don't know.  And here's why she's so hateable.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Did you hear that?  That's all right.  Was Ted going too far with that?  You know what?  He was making fun of the elderly.  Women in radio fucking stink.  He was making, she was sticking up for the elderly.  All right.  You know, and I bet she commits to it.  She doesn't stop after eight minutes caring about people, Jim.  Oh, God.  Jimmy doesn't care about people very long. 
[01:27:30]  Yes, I do.  I care about people for as long as I need to.  Like who?  Anybody who's in trouble.  The elderly, for instance.  Oh, I'm tired of them being beaten.  I'm tired of them not getting their social security checks.  I'm tired of their Medicare not coming through on time.  I'm tired of their prescription medication being too expensive for them to afford.  I'm tired of them being forgotten and lonely and being, ah, fuck them.  They're annoying.  They talk too much.  Die already. 
[01:28:00]  You're just tuning in.  You might want to listen to the first hour today.  Oh, Christ.  Fucking Jim.  Apathetic hero.  Almost committing.  Almost.  Fucking superhero.  Almost superhero.  Jim Rutton.  Boredom is his kryptonite.  All right.  We're going to rest Jacktober for a little bit.  We're going to take a break.  All right.  Do a couple other things.  And then we're going to get back into Jacktober because on the way for the Ted and Amy show.  That's enough, Ted.  On 93Q in Syracuse, they play Morning Malarkey. 
[01:28:30]  Oh, I just do it literally.  Look.  They play it a lot.  Goosebumps.  But they play it a lot.  Morning Malarkey.  It's on the way when we get back to Jacktober for today.  Why would they say that?  Malarkey didn't die.  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel on Sirius XM.  Have you ever wondered how many toenails it would take to fill up a jelly jar?  How much earwax would it take to fill a spackle bucket? 
[01:29:00]  Well, wonder no more, friends.  Join me on my journey of knowledge and discovery to find answers to some of the awe-inspiring  questions man has pondered since the dawn of time.  Today's episode, Foreskin Bonanza.  Did you know the average human foreskin measures a rubbery 2.3 centimeters long?  Laid end to end, it would take 4,000,000,000, 7,000,507,961 foreskins to circle the equator. 
[01:29:30]  If we measured height using foreskins, Jack would be 94 foreskins tall.  Or 18 black ones.  Mankind has patiently waited for the day when science would allow us to measure time in foreskins.  That day has come.  With 69,971 foreskins per mile and the average IndyCar hitting speeds of up to 214 miles per  hour, that equals a speed of 14,973,794 foreskins per hour, or FPH. 
[01:30:00]  P.U.  I wonder what a burnout would smell like.  Stay tuned for another edition of How Much.  The Opie and Anthony Show presents O&A Theatre.  Tonight's performance, Ray J. Johnson Jr., portrayed by James Norton.  And action.  Hey, Johnson.  Aaaaaaah!  This has been O&A Theatre.  Thank you, and have a pleasant evening. 
[01:30:30]  Sirius XM.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's coming out like pulled pork, I bet.  Oh, my God.  I just left the Ted and Amy show in the toilet.  A big chunk of it.  There's a lava lamp filling coming out of me.  We got to talk about it.  There's a little wrapper beef going on. 
[01:31:00]  We got to get into that.  A beef?  Wow.  We got to get into the gun control PSA thing.  And then we're going to go back to Ted and Amy for Jacktober, because we've just been turned  on to the Slumber Party video.  There's a video of Amy's Slumber Party that she has.  That we mentioned a little while ago.  And Opie brought up the fact that there is 3,210 views of this video.  That's fucking viral right there.  That's viral right there.  There should be a lot more dislikes.  There will be.  Do you think so? 
[01:31:30]  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Is that video going to have a lot of red after we're done with it?  Hey.  But first, we got some things.  Dings?  You know, it was 10 years ago today.  The Beltway Snipers did their thing.  10 years already.  That's a quick 10 years, huh?  Damn.  Well, Lee Malvo said he feels really horrible about it.  Aw, poor guy.  How do you feel when a guy comes out like that and takes complete responsibility for what  he did?  Well, he annoyed the fit because he goes, just forget about us. 
[01:32:00]  Move on.  And I think what he was saying was, like, don't let us wreck your lives anymore.  But they're going, how can we forget?  And he said the one thing that haunts him the most was the face of a husband as they shot  the wife in the parking lot, he said that guy's face as his wife was shot was just haunts  him.  But, you know, I think that he was the less guilty of the two because he was younger.  Yeah, impressionable or something.  I totally forgot that they executed the other guy.  John Muhammad's dead.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:32:30]  Holy shit.  How many years did that take?  Not very long because he was executed a few years ago.  Yeah.  So, like, that's quick for the death penalty.  As far as executions go, yeah, that wasn't actually too bad.  I guess, what did he plea?  What did he just say?  Fuck the appeals and kill me, whatever.  He did.  He did the right thing.  Good.  Fuck him.  What about this guy?  He's got life in prison.  No parole yet.  No parole?  But they're not going to kill him?  No.  No.  He got off the hook for old time's sake. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  That's good that he's...  Lee Boyd Malvo.  It's good that he feels bad and all, but...  He doesn't do many others.  But, you know, fuck him.  Lee Boyd.  How old is he now?  He's probably 26, maybe?  27?  That's it.  Yeah, he was an impressionable young guy.  What was he, 17, 18 at the time?  Poor young guy.  How old?  He's 27.  27, so he was 17 when Rod was down.  Yeah, he was a young dude.  Rod in prison.  Yeah, he deserves to die in jail.  Yes.  We got a gun control PSA starring the guy who got shot in the Colorado theater. 
[01:33:30]  Oh, boy.  Let's see what Ant thinks of this.  Oh, boy.  This past summer in a movie theater in Colorado, I was shot.  Shot in the face and neck.  Ow.  But I was lucky.  In the next four years, 48,000 Americans won't be so lucky because they'll be murdered with  guns in the next president's term.  Oh.  Enough to fill over 200 theaters.  So when you watch the presidential debates, ask yourself, who has a plan to stop gun violence?  Let's demand a plan.  United Against Illegal Gun Support Fund is responsible for the content of this advertising. 
[01:34:00]  Stop gun violence.  Against illegal guns.  Yeah.  Okay.  There are laws against.  That's why it's called illegal guns.  And how do you stop gun violence?  Guns aren't violent.  People, they tend to be a little violent.  But I mean, what the fuck?  He got shot in the face.  He got shot in the face.  He just wanted to enjoy a feature.  He was sitting down with popcorn and he got shot in the face.  I shot Marvin in the face.  He just wanted to enjoy a little popcorn and a full-length feature.  Yeah.  And he leaves with a fucking gunshot to the neck of the face. 
[01:34:30]  On a stretcher while the movie's still playing.  Right.  Perhaps if he could have pulled a rod out.  Jesus.  If he could have pulled out a rod.  I mean, there's no surprise he might be against guns.  I gotcha.  But I mean, really?  Just stop with the gun control.  There's fucking laws in place already.  There's no way you're stopping fucking loony people from doing bad things.  You could legislate all you fucking want.  If you made guns completely illegal, totally overturned the Second Amendment, made it illegal 
[01:35:00]  to even own a fucking gun, people would still get shot and people would still shoot people.  That's right.  Just happens.  But he went from, this is going to be a wonderful night out, to, oh my god, I think I'm going  to die!  Well, people were disappointed with the movie.  So, it wasn't going to be a wonderful night.  He might not have enjoyed the movie.  The movie's good.  Yeah.  Well, well, you got shot, is she?  Yeah.  Oh.  You don't have my permission to die. 
[01:35:30]  Well, hopefully you'll cure that bullet hole in your head, I say.  I have you in this prison, which everybody knows you're going to get out of.  Yeah, exactly.  There's no suspense.  You know, that was the last movie in that series, right?  By, what's his name there?  Who did those movies again?  Christopher Nolan.  Yeah, Christopher Nolan.  He should have fucking killed Batman.  And then go, look, let someone else figure this out, how this works.  They should have just killed him off. 
[01:36:00]  The new villain should be Jerry Shepardino.  I can't do the voice anymore.  Jerry Shepardino.  Batman.  I can't do it.  I had it.  Batman.  Batman.  Vubat.  Jerry Shepardino.  I can't do it anymore.  I lost it.  I forgot how to do it.  Shepardino.  Yeah, I know.  It's stuck in my head.  I hate that.  Yeah, I mean, look at Prohibition, right?  Look at what that did.  It made illegal booze something that built the mob, because people weren't just going to 
[01:36:30]  say, you know, they're going to take it.  You're saying the mob is bad?  No, I love the mob.  Okay, good.  It's my whole heritage.  Me too.  I used to in school go, mafia, mafia, yay, yay, yay.  You didn't.  You kind of did.  You did.  And drugs.  I mean, drugs are illegal, yet they're brought in from other countries.  They're produced here.  You make guns illegal.  I don't know.  It's still going to happen.  But the violence that is being perpetrated in our inner cities, that seems to be the 
[01:37:00]  issue.  And it seems to be a cultural problem, not a hardware problem.  Okay?  Well, and I understand this guy.  It was a it was an anomaly.  When you have these crazy people that burst in and do these mass shootings, it's terrible.  It's horrible.  I said, yes, yes.  I certainly wouldn't want to be involved in one.  But it happens.  Unfortunately, it happens.  But it's not at epidemic proportions.  But all this guy is saying, I just want it to happen less.  Yeah.  He just wants it to happen less.  There's no way any type of legislation is going to make it happen less. 
[01:37:30]  I don't know what could.  There are always going to be crazy people.  There always have been crazy people.  Does Jimmy have a take on this?  I'm just I'm just wondering if maybe.  Well, what bothers me is that too many people in this country are being injured in gun related incidents.  There's too many illegal guns and there's too many people who just set out to have a good day and go to work and they're killed.  And we have to do something.  We have to line up.  We have to march. 
[01:38:00]  We have got to get these illegal guns off the street.  We have to fight this.  You know what?  Fuck them.  Stay home, cocksuckers.  He sounds so into it for a very short period of time.  Like his pursuit.  His pursuit.  I'm going to say it again.  We never tease the show while we're doing the show.  But listen to the first hour.  Jimmy had an amazing experience last night.  That's all well and fine, but I'm in a high speed pursuit.  I've been chasing this bus for 31 blocks. 
[01:38:30]  And he made a right on the West Side Highway.  That's a man act.  I looked at him like Buford T. Norton.  Oh, you seem a little tall in the bus depot.  You want another PSA?  Yeah, please.  It's our PSA segment.  Oh, I like the PSA.  We might be able to be featured on Jocktober 7.  What's this PSA about?  More guns?  We're doing bits and stuff.  Yeah. 
[01:39:00]  You meet on the moors.  A man someone down the pub told you about.  You say the code word.  Give him the special hand signal.  Three rubs.  And the deal is done.  You're buying a used condom.  After all, it was cheaper.  And the man did say he'd washed it.  But how do you know?  Just think of where it's been.  Even if you know the man, never buy a used condom. 
[01:39:30]  So, wait.  This has to be a joke.  This has to be a joke.  Is it a joke?  That's not real.  British?  Yeah, I mean, it's on break.  I think it's a joke.  By the British Unused Condom Association.  Come on.  Bukka?  Like, almost Bukkaki?  Yeah.  The beginning of Bukkaki.  I don't know.  No, it's not real.  It's real.  This one's real.  Real or fake?  Is it fake like Sam's video? 
[01:40:00]  Or real?  This is way realer than Sam's video.  Or real like a woman eating bacon sundae.  Yeah, exactly.  That was real.  That was real.  Yeah, it's amazing how many times you've gotten to film that real woman.  She's always around.  That was real?  Like fucking Zelig.  Yeah.  Apparently she's also on Occupy Wall Street and Burger King.  Look, man.  The Oapster has different styles.  And the Oapster?  Sometimes I go for real life and other times maybe I'm trying to fuck with people. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah, that's a skit.  Maybe.  A skit.  Maybe.  A sketch.  A bit.  Yeah.  A shtick.  Look at the Oapster.  Oh, you're hiring actresses now.  Epic fail.  Epic fail.  You're hiring actresses now.  Epic fail.  What happened?  Fucking idiots.  I love those people.  I do one video.  Oh, really?  We're hiring actresses now?  I love them. 
[01:41:00]  It's like, dude, go outside.  There's a beautiful world out there.  Oh, that's great.  They just sit home and do nothing but fucking just...  I'll break it down.  Epic fail.  I've tried something a little different in a couple videos.  It worked very well.  And then you get, really?  This is the direction you're going with your videos now?  Hiring actresses?  Maybe I'm just trying something.  They don't think it's a success? 
[01:41:30]  Oh.  Your son's a big success.  They think it's a fail?  A fail?  It's an epic fail.  Fail.  Fail.  Fail.  I'm trying a little something new.  Something a little different.  Oh, is that fucking funny?  I went back to reality videos, so relax.  Oh, God.  Hey, Sam, there's a little rap thing going on.  Yeah? 
[01:42:00]  With Fiddy Sen and who's this other guy?  It's Rick Ross and who else?  Oh, I thought the guy's name was Gunplay.  His name is Gunplay.  Oh, what?  He's on Rick Ross' label.  I don't like the name of that guy.  Rick Ross' music group.  That's...  Who kid doesn't like the Rick Ross?  Glamorizing.  Yeah.  Is this the BET fight?  Sorry.  Yeah, it's related to it.  Another instance.  What happens?  Where rappers just act up and fuck at an award show at BET.  It's like... 
[01:42:30]  Why would...  And the BET Awards.  Yeah.  Why don't people just say...  There's always a fucking problem there.  Always.  Why do they allow guns at these award shows?  I bet they don't.  Well, how are they getting them in?  I thought they had guns, did they?  I don't know.  There was...  They were shooting outside, they said.  Yeah.  Outside.  I'm sure they...  Can you turn this a little louder?  I can't see this.  Are we going with this or what I got?  Rick Ross and Young Jeezy.  You can start with this.  Oh, go full screen, you fucking piece of shit. 
[01:43:00]  I know.  I want to see Young Jeezy.  Tell the ad right now.  I'm sorry.  He wants to see Young Jeezy.  Young Jeezy.  Is there volume?  Oh, fuck.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, fuck.  I can't do it.  We're good.  Oh, fuck.  We're good.  We're good.  We're good.  We're good.  We're good.  We're good.  TMZ showing some TMB. 
[01:43:30]  It's got to be exhausting to be black.  Doesn't it look like a lot of work?  Of course there's a lot of high blood pressure.  Looks like a lot of work.  Damn it.  He's the white guy.  He's the white guy.  He's the white guy in the house.  Yeah, yeah.  Off the top.  We're just listening to noise. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm sorry, guys.  Yeah, there's a real sense of noise.  It's just kind of noise.  It's just kind of noise.  It's just kind of noise.  It's just kind of noise.  It's only some fucking childish nonsense over who is disrespected.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, it's just fucking horrible.  It really is embarrassing that like, and I understand most rappers are like thugs and  a lot of them are.  It's a terrible cultural problem.  It just, every time there's one of these stupid events, there's a problem.  You never see this shit at rock gatherings. 
[01:44:30]  No.  Never.  No, no.  It's fucking constant.  You'll see a good stampede.  Yeah, I mean, look, eight or nine people will be found trampled to death.  Yes.  Trying to get good seats.  Right, right.  Who are you?  Who?  Who?  Who?  Who?  Who?  Where was that?  Cincinnati?  St. Louis?  Where was that?  I think it was Cincy, right?  I think it might have been, right?  But all I think of is just behave.  Like, it really is.  It just cut the shit already.  Sam, I don't know about this beef. 
[01:45:00]  What's going on here?  Sam, you're our liaison into the hip-hop world.  Yeah.  There's a lot going on, and it's hard to keep up with, especially because most of it's fake.  What?  Like your video?  Is this fake?  No.  Is your video fake?  No, I mean, I think usually they start these beefs that are nothing, and then egos get involved,  and they decide they're going to fight each other.  Yes, I remember when Ozzy and Kiss had that, oh, that's right.  That's right, they did.  I remember when R.E.M. wanted to beat up Rush.  Oh, that's right. 
[01:45:30]  I think Rush could take R.E.M.  Easily.  You think?  Yeah.  Oh, I met a few of the R.E.O. guys.  R.E.M. or R.E.M.?  Did I say R.E.O.?  Yeah.  It could have been R.E.M.  R.E.O.  R.E.O.  R.E.O. Speedwagon.  Yeah, remember when Metallica had that fight with Slayer?  Oh, that's right.  Of course you don't.  Why?  Because they're fucking civilized.  That's, uh...  Holy shit.  The gunfire and the fucking...  The threat of death with these people is just amazing.  Did I ever tell you that I had to ride a roller coaster with one of the R.E.O. guys? 
[01:46:00]  R.E.O. Speedwagon?  As a radio bit.  Ew.  All right, hold on.  When I was in full Opster mode.  Hold on, it's Jocktober.  This could fit in.  I don't remember which guy, but it wasn't one of the main guys, because the main guys couldn't  be bothered with the dumb radio promotion.  Would you get, like, the drummer from R.E.O.?  Something like that.  Or, like...  The backup keyboard player?  Bass player or something.  Bass player.  Like, who are you?  I'm the R.E.O. guy.  You had to ride a roller coaster with him?  Yeah.  Well, I was the jock on site.  And you got a chance to ride the roller coaster with R.E.O. 
[01:46:30]  Oh.  But it wasn't the whole band?  Well, they were in town for their big concert.  Was maybe the roller coaster was called The Storm, and you were riding the storm out?  Dude.  I swear to you, I forgot about this until this very moment that I did this.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I'll try to remember the details.  I'll look back.  I think I got photographs of this event.  I have to see that.  Yeah.  Were you screaming?  Do you have this picture?  Are you guys with your hands up in the air as you passed the camera station? 
[01:47:00]  Maybe.  At the end of it, did you go, yeah!  Like, extreme.  Oh.  Oh.  It's Rochester that you get the big acts.  Oh.  Now, you might say to yourself, well, R.E.O. was a big act.  No, it was long past their fucking time.  It was?  Yeah, man.  We never got, like, curd bands.  We weren't good enough for currant bands when I lived in Rochester.  Together.  Oh, yeah.  Rush could kick out.  There.  There it goes.  It's going to kick in. 
[01:47:30]  So queer.  Oh, clear.  I'm sorry.  Trouble.  I do enjoy this.  Whee!  Did you click up at this point?  I just remember how to ride the roller coaster with a guy.  It lasted, like, two minutes, and I never saw him again.  Ladies and gentlemen, keep your hands and feet in the car at all times,  and keep your cock in your zipper and your mouth off of the dicks.  I can't fight this fear anymore. 
[01:48:00]  I forgot who I started fighting for.  It's time to fight.  It's right.  There's storm now.  That's it.  The NUCDA did their R's.  It's your work forever.  You just fucked up another song for people.  I never noticed the R thing until now.  Oh, yeah.  It's on.  I can't fight this feeling anymore.  I've forgotten what I've started fighting for. 
[01:48:30]  Can't I have to crawl upon the floor?  Floor.  Floor.  I came through the door.  Wow.  I can't fight this feeling anymore.  Floor, door, more.  More.  Nice.  My mother's name is Delore.  Oh, boy.  That was good?  No.  Yuck.  So, there's a beef about what? 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  Well, this guy.  Now, who does too?  Did Rick Ross diss Jeezy or did Jeezy?  Oh, what the fuck?  It's exhausting this shit.  It really is.  Oh, no.  Someone showed me disrespect.  Get into your fucking $200,000 car and shut up.  Fuck enough of this shit.  To children.  50 cents worth $100 million.  What are you doing?  You know, he's not involved, but all these guys are fucking super rich.  Well, they're involved in a way, I guess. 
[01:49:30]  But what are you doing if you're worth $100 million?  If I was worth $100 million, you would never hear a peep from me.  And the whole thing of this disrespect thing without earning respect.  Right.  Like, respect is expected in the community.  Well, it is in the word.  It's, yes, respect.  Expect.  Expect respect.  And expect.  It's expected in the community, this just blind respect.  And if you disrespect somebody, it's like, you have to, respect absolutely has to be earned. 
[01:50:00]  You can't just say, you disrespected me without, and it's phony respect.  Ugh.  And it's a death sentence if you diss.  So I'm like, fuck you.  I like Rick Ross, though, because 50 Cent tried to ruin his life when he was much bigger than Rick Ross.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, he tried to humiliate him, and it didn't.  It's amazing that Rick Ross survived that.  Like, I couldn't believe that didn't wreck him.  How did he survive that fucking beating that 50 Cent gave him?  He's good.  He's good.  He's a good rapper.  Do we have any Rick Ross? 
[01:50:30]  I like who he is, but I don't know his music.  And that's what a lot of people liked his music.  Yeah, people love him.  Like, it's all so very violent.  I don't like it at all.  His big song is, my name is Rick, not Jeffrey.  Rick, not Jeffrey.  Whoa.  Jeffrey Ross.  Hey, did REO do Time For Me To Fly?  Time For Me To Fly.  Is it Iraq?  Is that?  Yeah, yeah.  People are saying, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. 
[01:51:00]  Who's the fruit that came up with the first yup?  Oh, Hans, with Kevin from Connecticut right behind him.  That was a big hit, right?  You're a couple of fairies.  I'm starting to remember tunes by those guys.  Roll With The Changes.  That was them, right?  Roll With The Changes.  And what was the name of their album?  It was a dumb name.  It was called...  We Adore Cock.  Can't tune a...  Piano, but you can tune a fish.  No, you can't tune a...  But you can tune an organ with your mouth.  You can't tune a fish, but you can tune a...  What?  High Infidelity.  You can tune a piano, but you can't tune a fish? 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, I think that was the name of one of their albums.  That's For You.  More R's.  I never noticed this.  Oh, it's terrible.  Let's hear the R's.  I've swallowed my pride for you.  For.  Lived in life for you.  But you still make me feel like a thief.  You got me stealing your love away.  Cause you never give it.  Give it.  Peeling the ears away, and we can't relive it. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, I make you laugh, and you make me cry.  I believe it's time for me to fly.  It's time for me to fly.  Thumbs up or down?  Be honest.  Be honest.  Definitely a guilty pleasure back in what I call the day.  I could see you using this video for one of your helicopter vids.  Yes.  Or the song for one of your helicopter vids.  With the sweeping fucking panoramic shots. 
[01:52:30]  Is it time for me to fly?  It works.  It works.  It's perfect.  That is going to be the next video that gets banned on YouTube for using fucking copywritten  material.  I know.  There are assholes about that.  Oh, jeez.  Wait, but you can.  Yeah, they kind of give you a warning, and then Canada doesn't play them.  Oh.  I don't know what the fuck the deal is there.  You got to use one of theirs.  Kind of odd.  Anthony knows the lyrics.  I've heard this song a million times.  I know this one, too.  And I have a pornographic memory.  I probably have played this 200 times on the radio when I was a rock jock. 
[01:53:00]  Feeding your knee for rock.  I believe it's time for me to fly.  And now the big harmony.  Time for me to fly.  Hope there's no delays.  Time for me to fly.  It's cloudy, so we may be on the tarmac for a while.  Hello, baby.  Time for me to fly, baby.  It's time for me to die. 
[01:53:30]  Time for me to fall.  A chantilly lace fuselage in my face.  All right, where are we?  Rick Ross.  Do we care about the beef at this point?  I want to hear a little bit of Rick Ross.  I don't know what he sounds like.  All right.  What?  He's hustling.  I think he's hustling.  Pete Rose tribute. 
[01:54:00]  I don't know about you.  I just work.  What's he doing every day?  I just work.  It's exhausting.  Every day he's hustling from fucking noon till three.  It's a bit repetitive.  Does it kick in?  This stinks.  This sucks.  I kind of like it.  No, it's repetitive shit.  Well, I'm sure it's going to kick in.  Oh.  All you suckers think you're tripping with, yes, I'm the boss. 
[01:54:30]  Say I'm 45, white on white, that's Rick Ross.  I cut him wide.  I cut him long.  I cut him fast.  What?  I keep him coming back.  We keep him coming back.  Try another Rick Ross.  This sounds like, honestly, I don't like that.  It sounds like really like 1980s.  It sort of sounds like Biggie Smalls a little bit in the same sort of.  Oh, doesn't it all?  No, not really?  No.  How many people can pull off the Biggie?  What song is this from?  Shaft?  Is this?  No, no.  This is SWAT.  The SWAT theme? 
[01:55:00]  Is this SWAT?  Yes.  I like this.  The SWAT theme song.  Being a child of the 80s.  Oh, wait a minute.  1970s.  When he say, nigga, what you want, nigga, what you want.  It's funny, there's no outrage over that.  That's me when someone tries to change lanes in front of me.  Oh, wait a minute. 
[01:55:30]  This is good.  I like this.  Yeah.  This is some good shit right here, yo.  Yeah?  Do you think he's better than 50 Cent?  The Negro is.  In person.  In, in, in, in, in, in, in person.  Do you think he's better than a rapper?  Yeah, I mean, more consistent.  50 Cent hasn't really put anything out good since his first album.  Because he's a, he's a mogul.  Yeah, but he's put out four albums since then that haven't been good.  Oh, really? 
[01:56:00]  I don't, I don't think lyrically 50 Cent's great.  So the, the guy's talking about the beefs?  No, and then, so the fight that we just watched.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Was Rick Ross and young Jeezy fighting.  Oh.  Because they don't like each other because, I guess Rick Ross a while back, uh, said that  he was with a certain crew that Jeezy was actually with.  Crew?  Rick Ross wasn't with.  A sailor?  No, not a sailing crew.  Oh, see?  Oh, I thought it was a crew.  Do we have, do we have to play this?  And then, you don't have, it's your show.  Your name's on the wall.  What?  But what is it?  And then, the same night at the BET Awards, there was another thing? 
[01:56:30]  This guy Gunplay, who's on Rick Ross's label, apparently they're saying, got jumped by like  five or six G-Unit guys while 50 Cent was there.  Are these, uh, entertainers?  Is that what you're talking about?  You're not talking about some kind of fucking thing happening in South Central?  No.  Central?  South Central.  And they asked, they stopped 50 Cent, like TMZ stopped him, and they were like, what  happened at the BET Awards?  And he goes, they gave out awards, and he just kept walking. 
[01:57:00]  So, should we play this?  Gunplay says he didn't fire shots.  I want to hear that shit, yo.  And they said there were shots fired, but Gunplay was like, shots fired.  What did Mr. Gunplay say?  Did someone call 911 and then just give up?  There's shots for, ah, fuck it.  So, uh, what happened?  First of all, were you the one that fired the shot?  Even if I was, I wouldn't incriminate myself like that.  Yeah, motherfucker!  That's funny.  Solid point.  Like, what, what, what happened?  What caused this? 
[01:57:30]  Um, because it got pretty bad.  I mean, there were shots fired.  Nah, I don't know about shots fired.  I don't know nothing about no shots fired.  I'm going to be totally honest with you.  Sounds like first 48.  Um, but, you know, all I know, I, I, I, I had to fight all five dudes.  Who were the five dudes, Gunplay?  Who, who are you squaring off with?  Just calling him Gunplay.  Um, I don't know, it was some, um, some, uh, one of, uh, couple of 50 cent people.  Um, you know, um, you know, fought him off, kicked one of, one of they fat asses, kicked him off in the dirt, and, um, and, and, and the police sprayed me with mace, and, um, that was it. 
[01:58:00]  You know, it was just a big old melee.  Gunplay though, you're in an award show.  You would think like, I mean, uh, this kind of thing doesn't happen at the Emmys.  I know, man, you know, you got a bunch of motherfuckers, you got a bunch of motherfuckers in the place, you know, with a lot of money and a lot of egos, you know, it's something bound to happen.  Oh, no, I like the Emmys. 
[01:58:30]  I like the Grammys, where they're TMZ.  Oh.  You have a lot of people in the place with a lot of money.  What?  That's every award show.  Yeah, the cops came and pepper sprayed everybody.  Machine Gun Kelly tweeted that he got pepper sprayed.  Wait, wait, who's Machine Gun Kelly?  He's a white rapper, he's 50, uh, not 50, uh, P. Diddy's artist.  He's a white rapper named Machine Gun Kelly, can we see him?  Kelly, so he's got the Irish thing along.  The real Machine Gun Kelly's gotta be rolling in his grave.  Rolling over in his grave.  He can't be happy about that.  Meh, meh, I don't like that, see? 
[01:59:00]  I don't like a spook taking my name, see?  Meh.  Oh, he's a white guy.  This guy's big song is a rat-a-tat-tat, a rat-a-tat-tat.  Ah, he looks badass.  He's got a lot of tattoos.  You wouldn't fuck with that guy.  Anarchy.  He looks like a punk.  Let me hear his music.  He's very polarizing.  Is he good?  What?  What do you mean polarizing?  Well, let's hear him.  People either like him or they really hate him.  I thought he was like a polar bear.  Yeah, polarizing.  I thought polarizing maybe there was something with icing, like maybe a cupcake or something. 
[01:59:30]  Like icing on a cake, I get it.  Can we hear him, Mirok?  Have some coffee.  How about this?  Play Mirok before I go in there.  Mirok, I'm looking for a song.  Sam, is he on YouTube for fuck's sake?  Yeah.  I got ten guys here with fingers.  No one's finding anything.  Oh, he's got a high voice.  Yeah.  This is his like radio pop scene.  I don't know.  He's got a, he sounds like a girl.  No, this is a girl singing.  What?  Yeah.  Wait.  I don't get this.  Who's this?  Is this Alicia Keys?  No, this is another female. 
[02:00:00]  Jessica Tandy?  Alicia Keychain.  Why isn't she the star?  I hate when white people have to rap like black people, but they have to.  Yeah.  You have to have that black accent thing going on.  It doesn't work the other way.  No.  I'm going down to the store, but I don't want to come back anymore.  Yeah.  You sound like a guy talking weird.  I can't fight this feeling any longer.  It doesn't work.  All right.  Enough of this. 
[02:00:30]  All right.  He's famous.  I like snow better.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I don't understand why.  Lucky boom, boom down.  Right.  Oh, nice.  I don't understand why the woman with the really nice voice, why isn't she the fucking star  of the fucking song?  She's featured.  Why is it the dirty rap guy?  She's just on the hook.  Yeah, but the hook is nice.  Make the whole song the hook.  Yeah, but she doesn't.  I mean, she'll have.  Am I showing my age?  The point is for her to be on the hook, and then eventually she'll come out with her own  shit when she's ready.  That's like, New York.  Right.  And there's the hook. 
[02:01:00]  And then, you know.  Yeah, and then Jay-Z messes up a cool-sounding song.  Come on, man.  Jay-Z makes it much better.  He messes it up.  That New York.  I would listen to that.  Okay.  Well, you can buy Alicia Keys' album, then.  There's tons of them.  Yeah.  All right.  Make that into three or four minutes with the New York part.  Not all the da-da-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba-ba-da-ba-ba-da-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  I hate it, man.  Hey, can we introduce?  I don't think so.  Can we introduce Gunplay to Mark Says Hi?  I think that would be kind of fun.  It would be fun for everyone.  Gunplay.  Gunplay, this is Mark Says Hi. 
[02:01:30]  Mark Says Hi.  Gunplay.  This is Gunplay.  Right.  Gunplay my ass.  Gunplay my ass.  Mark Says Hi goes, hello.  And then Gunplay shoots him.  He will.  That's such a fucking, just a weird thing to call it.  Oh, you went to ass play?  Diddle, diddle, diddle.  No, that's where the bunch of asses go on stage and do Shakespeare.  It's like the cheeks open up.  Shakespeare jokes.  I can't think of any.  Alas.  Poor Yurik. 
[02:02:00]  We have a timing issue if we're going to get back to Rocktober.  I just want to let you know.  A few more minutes, got a break, then we do the Rocktober, because then we got a guest coming in.  Who's coming in today?  I can never say his name.  And Cary Ellis, he was in The Princess Bride.  Oh, he was in The Princess Bride, and he was in the original Saw, which was the best Saw.  Of course it was.  And if you didn't know the twist at the end of it when you saw it, it was fucking amazing.  Killer.  Killer movie, that fucking original Saw.  Then they got silly, but. 
[02:02:30]  He was in Saw 7, too.  I know, but come on.  That original one, cutting off the fucking foot.  Are they done with the Saw movies, finally?  They are done.  They finally said okay enough?  Saw 3D was the final and seventh Saw.  Gunplay has a little more audio here.  Right.  Listen to this.  It's getting fucking real.  Now, was 50 Cent actually in, was Fiddy in with a group that you were fighting with?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But he was hiding behind all the security.  I couldn't get to him.  I'm trying to break his little fucking neck.  Hey, can I ask you a question, Gunplay? 
[02:03:00]  Does your beef with 50 and the five guys, is that connected to Rick Ross and Jeezy?  Is that like the same groups?  Nah, this is whole different.  This is two different things.  So it wasn't connected to the fight backstage?  It was just another fight?  Nah.  Nah, we just, nah.  Nah, we just going at it with everybody.  Let's go.  You know, MMG, Maybach Music.  Kill them all.  Jesus.  So he has two massive beefs?  Oh, yeah.  Maybach Music Group does.  How the fuck do you, like, walk around with two massive beefs you gotta deal with?  Because Rick Ross is the big guy, and then, you know, so now Rick Ross has Jeezy and 50 Cent to deal with. 
[02:03:30]  It's like the mob.  It's exhausting.  It's like the mob, but they're pretending to be the mob.  And this is, these are artists, music artists, that are supposed to be half-civilized.  Imagine now, you take that whole mentality and put it down into the gangs.  And then you realize how fucking, how futile trying to get them together and get off the violence, silence the violence, yo. 
[02:04:00]  It's, it's, it's impossible.  You know what this situation needs?  What?  REO Speedwagon.  Ah, yeah.  Oh, good.  They would be able.  They would fuck up some people, man.  Oh.  REO would fuck up some people.  Are we going to ride the storm out?  We can ride the storm out into the break.  We can feed the need to rock.  This, this used to be rock.  I kind of like this one, too.  Like, you used to listen to this on the radio and be like, yeah, turn this shit up.  Turn this rock and roll up.  Remember when you asked if you were showing your age?  Ride in the storm out. 
[02:04:30]  Starm.  There's a big storm.  Yes, Sam.  Do you?  You can't, like, in the same breath, be like, oh, Jay-Z ruined that song.  Let's put on some REO Speedwagon.  What happened?  Did I put devil horns up?  No.  This is a classic.  Yes.  Oh, God.  It's REO Speedwagon.  And where, what are we doing?  And I'm not missing a fight.  Woo!  Oh, please.  Everyone liked this.  Liked.  Like it was.  This doesn't rock.  This doesn't rock as much as I remember it rocking. 
[02:05:00]  No.  No.  This was rock, though.  It's quite simple.  This was played on rock radio.  Not easy listening.  Not fucking, like, uh...  You have a lot of people who don't remember that.  Child of the 80s, wouldn't they?  No, they wouldn't.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, they wouldn't.  The children of the 80s remember this.  Why don't we go to break?  We don't have to play this shit.  Yeah.  We got, uh, Jocktober.  Part two of Jocktober for today as we focus on Ted and Amy on 93Q in Syracuse.  Oh, please.  We got the big slumber party video we got to get to. 
[02:05:30]  And, of course, morning malarkey after these messages.  This is the O.P.M.D. Show.  On SiriusXM.  Sometimes the road to a blissful relationship can be bumpy.  Uh, marriage is...  No one's saying that you don't do a lot of stuff.  It's like, it's a business.  It's a machine.  One person's doing the twittering, which is rich, and the other person is spelling all the words.  It's comedy's most dysfunctional married couple, Voss and Bonnie. 
[02:06:00]  If passion is like a roaring fire, then Voss is peeing all over it.  Is he an affectionate guy?  He, no.  Is he bad with, like, casually loving touching?  Well, because sometimes he touches you, but it's like a toddler or a monster that doesn't, like, hasn't figured out how to caress.  And why flatter the one you love and the mother of your children when you can shatter her fragile ego?  Right, Rich?  Sometimes he calls my ass Margaret Cho's face. 
[02:06:30]  Wow, Rich!  So if you think your relationship is doomed, look at Voss and Bonnie.  And rest a little easier knowing it could be a lot worse.  I remember now what a dick he is.  One time I was blowing him quite well, by the way, and he farted.  And then he gets mad!  That's the best thing I've ever heard.  I mean, not a whole thing.  One hit, huh? 
[02:07:00]  Hey, look, it's, uh...  Pete's fucking that sugar, dude.  Huh?  Well, that's not him, but they just showed...  Oh, the guy we're interviewing?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's also on CNN?  CNN.  We've got the same guest as CNN.  Yeah, nice.  Look at us.  Wow, that's amazing.  There he is.  Boy, what did we do on the shitter pre-smartphone? 
[02:07:30]  Because, uh, how constructive is it to just be able to read, get the news, all kinds of stuff.  I remember having to, um, reach over for, uh, for like the, the, the, um...  Shampoo bottle or something?  Or comet.  Yeah, the comet cleanser thing, and read the instructions back in the day.  Yeah.  Now, you know, you're just winging all over, hey, let me check out some IMDb. 
[02:08:00]  Uh, let's see what that actor...  These, uh, children of the 90s?  They, uh, have no clue.  They have no idea how easy they have it.  With the, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Being a child of the 80s, man, we had to deal with some shit.  I don't know what we used to do.  Ted and Amy time.  Back to Jacktober.  By the way, uh, Phase 3 and Phase 4 have been completed.  Yeah.  According to the listeners.  Oh, boy.  Is that true, Sam?  Fast.  Yeah, the Facebook page is down.  The Facebook page is entirely down. 
[02:08:30]  We're two for two, by the way.  Two for two.  They no longer have an active Facebook page up right now.  That's a shame.  Can we make this official and do a, uh, oh, boy, is Iraq in there?  Oh, no.  Or is he taking it?  Yay!  He was hiding behind, uh, the Fox building.  Iraq, can we do a, uh, a sweeper to bring everyone back to Jacktober, please?  Banana Ram is looking a little bruised.  Was that Banana Ram?  Yeah.  No, it wasn't.  It was Banana Ram.  Was that really Banana Ram? 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  Is that one person?  Stop the sweeper.  One person or two, Banana Ram?  There were two girls that were, I think Banana Ram was three, but they just showed two girls.  I think they lost one.  I think one died.  No way.  I think so, yeah.  Really?  Where'd you see them?  If I know my music news.  I liked the dark-haired girl in Banana Ram.  I loved it from Kurt Loder.  They walked by?  They were on the Fox.  Oh, well.  No, they're on the TV.  They're doing Fox and Friends or something.  They're in here, too.  Are they?  Banana Ram?  Very sick.  What's the matter, Jimmy?  I don't know if they're queasy.  Oh, no.  Are you going to vomit?  You all right?  I think it's too much coffee and not enough food. 
[02:09:30]  Too much excitement last night.  I know.  Being a crime fighter for you.  Oh, my God, right?  He gets all sick when he fights crime for eight minutes.  My whole system is thrown out of whack.  Oh, Jimmy.  Was it eight minutes?  Yes, but it was a very high-stress crime situation.  Sip a little water.  My system's out of whack.  Let's sip some water.  I know there will be an animation for that one.  There has to be.  Look at Crime Fighting Jimmy.  Crime Fighting Jimmy.  For eight minutes.  But, man, if you could hold out and get to nine minutes,  Jimmy will be long gone.  He will not be chasing you anymore. 
[02:10:00]  Ted and Amy in the morning.  I guess we're not going to do the sweeper after all  because we talked over it, which is fine.  We're doing Jocktober.  We're making fun of radio all over the fucking place.  Today, it's Syracuse's turn.  And there's Ted and Amy in the morning  on the number one hit music station, 93Q.  So, are you ready for the morning malarkey?  Oh, God.  Malarkey.  Morning malarkey.  What is the definition of malarkey?  Well, it's just like fun, you know?  It's a good way of saying bullshit, I think.  Whoa.  That's malarkey.  Oh, that's a bunch of malarkey. 
[02:10:30]  That's a bunch of malarkey.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yep.  And it was a character on Band of Brothers.  I love that series.  How about dadlarky?  Malarkey.  Oh, that's not funny.  Malarkey is speech or writing designed to obscure,  mislead, or impress.  Nice.  Fan fiction?  Buncombe.  Buncombe?  Yeah.  If I had my druthers, no malarkey would ever be used.  Pure buncombe.  Oh, callback.  That's a good one. 
[02:11:00]  Hey, time to play Morning Malarkey with Ted and Amy.  A great prize is up for grabs.  And guess what?  You might hear an impression in here.  Oh!  And wait till you hear this prize, too.  Is it a good prize?  It's a nice prize.  Yeah, radio's dropped off with prizes, by the way.  Oh, man.  It used to be huge.  No one radio used to give away, like, fucking cars.  Oh, my God.  Now they're giving away fucking, go see the leaves.  Yeah.  Right.  It's 7-E-E-E-N.  Ted and Amy in the morning. 
[02:11:30]  Steve and Jeannie Kim.  That's who we have standing by, ready to play some malarkey for a great prize.  All ready to win.  Date night at Ichiban Japanese Steakhouse.  This is good for any Wednesday night.  Doesn't have to be tonight.  Not even a weekend.  What a shitty gift.  They didn't give away a free dinner for the weekend?  At Ichiban on a fucking Wednesday night.  Any Wednesday night.  Gee, thanks.  My favorite radio show.  After 11 p.m.  Jeez.  First prize is you get to kick me in the cunt.  Okay, there's a Facebook page for 93Q The Station. 
[02:12:00]  Oh.  So we're now at The Station's Facebook page?  There's a picture of an older gentleman, nude.  Yes.  Not very well endowed, but thick.  Yeah.  Uh, peeing into a coffee pot.  There's a sign that says Jocktober pointing to him, and a sign that says Ted Namy and pointing  to the coffee pot that's being pissed at him.  And there's somebody opening her vagina and asshole.  Oh, boy.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, God.  The picture from the guy at the radio station who had a baby and took a picture with his 
[02:12:30]  baby.  Yeah.  There's a thing that says sex offender with him.  Yes.  And we have nothing to do with this.  No, because that's not true.  Of course not.  Yeah, we didn't do any of that.  We didn't do any of that.  Who did that?  People are out of control.  Some fan whose name is Happy Jocktober.  I guess it's a 93Q fan.  I don't know.  Yeah, of course it is.  I don't know that person.  Just a way to do it.  We did not tell them to do that.  Yeah.  I am on record.  Hey, so let's do the malarkey thing.  They're giving away, what, dinner for a Wednesday night?  That's a cool thing.  Any Wednesday. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah.  Oh, any Wednesday.  Oh, Jesus.  What's that say?  Oh, my God.  Is that a real picture?  I think it's photoshopped.  Yeah.  Don't even describe that one, please.  Oh, it's terrible.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  These pictures are terrible.  Wow.  They're not holding back.  Oh, this is so bad.  Yeah, this is weird listeners. 
[02:13:30]  She's got a black eye.  All right, listen.  Let's do this.  It's 7-E-E-L-E-N, Ted and Amy in the morning.  Steve and Jeannie Kim, that's who we have standing by, ready to play some malarkey for a great prize.  All ready to win date night at Ichiban Japanese Steakhouse.  This is good for any Wednesday night.  Doesn't have to be tonight, but any Wednesday night at Ichiban.  Here's how it works.  You know, malarkey, you've got to figure out who's telling the truth, who's full of it.  Good luck.  Well, this celebrity has a new memoir.  Oh, I like the one on the left. 
[02:14:00]  I remember her.  I liked her a lot.  Oh, man, let's listen.  I think that's a new Bananarama girl on the left.  No.  No?  No.  You sure?  I know her.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, they sound great.  Look at Danny Ross on the right, dancing.  Oh, man.  It's a big song, right? 
[02:14:30]  Yes.  Huge.  I'm your penis.  I'm your fire.  Enjoy.  Desire.  And penis was his name.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  She looks.  The one on the left was the one I really, like, used to be in love with.  Wow, she held up.  Back in the 80s.  She still looks kind of cute.  She held up.  Are you a fan of the Cruel Summer?  It's a cruel, cruel, cruel summer.  I don't know that one.  And they had their 80s fucking, like, the kerchief-y things tied around. 
[02:15:00]  Their hair was flying out the top.  Yeah.  Da, da, da, da, da, da, da.  Oh, man.  You don't know this one, Jimmy?  Really?  What's the matter with you?  This was a big hit.  What were you doing?  And what was their Christmas song you rocked?  I was rapping.  Christmas song?  Yeah, they had a Christmas song.  I don't like the guys dancing with Bananarama.  Get them out of there.  Just getting a little mump. 
[02:15:30]  God, the prolapsed ass.  That's disgusting.  All right.  Some of these pictures going up on that site.  Prolapsed asshole.  These are terrible.  Da, da, da.  That's a cruel.  Da, da.  All right.  Enough of the Bananarama.  Yeah.  What the fuck is that?  Fair enough.  Yeah. 
[02:16:00]  So let's do, let's get back into the, oh, someone's got some Pop-Tarts coming.  Thank you, Kenny.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  The Pop-Tart bringer.  Yeah.  Quickly.  Thank you.  What do you got there, Jimmy?  I have a plain fat-free yogurt and blueberries because I'm eating better.  What about the powdered peanut butter we learned about today?  Well, Kenny, I asked for it and all of a sudden, I didn't.  Kenny, can we find powdered peanut butter?  Not today.  Yeah.  For down the road?  Well, if you can't find that, could you just wring out your ass hairs and hopefully some 
[02:16:30]  crusted doo-doos?  Oh, my God.  Amy of Ted and Amy says it's delicious.  Yeah.  I wouldn't take a word anything.  But can we at least try it on our own?  I wouldn't take a word anything.  Yeah, I know.  I don't know what the fuck sentence structure that was.  Exactly.  We need dried peanut butter.  Or powdered?  Powdered peanut butter?  Powdered.  Right.  Let's find that.  Let's find something.  What is that?  I don't think so, GH.  No?  Oh, boy.  Why?  They've got to sell it all nice and round.  Oh, fuck. 
[02:17:00]  That'd be nice.  All right.  Let's get back to this.  Ted and Amy in the morning malarkey.  Finally.  Whoa.  Jesus.  Why is there a picture of a guy holding a horse penis on that Facebook page?  They are really weirding some of the most horrible pictures.  That's terrible.  They do have twisted listeners.  That's available.  It's amazing when you look at what pictures are available.  I know.  Why wouldn't you suck it?  The horse?  Yes, of course.  Of course.  Of course.  We're in full ADD radio mode.  Yes.  You know that.  All right.  Let's focus. 
[02:17:30]  Because we've got a big guest coming in.  All right.  And we've got to get this jock.  Rock jock.  It's jocktober.  Jocktober over with.  To be tonight, but any Wednesday night at Itchy Bond.  Here's how it works.  You know, malarkey, you've got to figure out who's telling the truth, who's full of it.  Good luck.  Well, this celebrity has a new memoir coming out in November.  It's called Roll Me Up and Smoke Me When I Die.  Roll me up and smoke me when I die.  So who is that celebrity?  I'm going to go with the former Snoop Dogg, current Snoop Lion.  Oh, that's right. 
[02:18:00]  I'd forgotten Snoop Dogg changed his name.  Yeah, because he's all into the whole Rasta thing.  I'm going to say Snoop Dogg has got that coming out.  I'm saying it's the Matthew McConaughey.  Matthew McConaughey.  Who is a little out there.  He's pretty earthy.  He might be one to possibly come out with a book title.  Oh, wait a minute.  The hotline is ringing.  Ted and Amy, good morning.  Maybe I didn't love you.  Is this Willie Nelson?  Is this Willie Nelson?  It's fucking hilarious.  No, Chip.  That's fucking great. 
[02:18:30]  You're like, holy fuck.  This show just gets better and better at being worse.  You don't have to say, is this Willie Nelson?  Is this Willie Nelson?  Maybe I...  Oh, God.  Look.  Sounds like Katherine Hepburn doing Willie Nelson.  Oh, wait a minute.  The hotline is ringing.  Ted and Amy, good morning.  Maybe I didn't love you.  Is this Willie Nelson?  Is this Willie Nelson?  Is this Willie Nelson?  Willie!  Oh, Willie. 
[02:19:00]  Really?  Good morning, Teddy.  You've had a lot of arrests.  Oh, Willie.  A lot of kids.  Let's just leave.  On the road again.  Okay, Willie.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Was she saying that the kid, there are a lot of kids, like, listening?  And that maybe he shouldn't be doing pot jokes?  I guess.  That would be her job.  Let me hear that.  How far back was it?  What a fucking hole.  What a hole she is.  Ugh.  A gaping hole.  Oh, God.  Now, the kids. 
[02:19:30]  It's Adam Sandler doing Willie Nelson, right?  So they got Adam Sandler on the hotline?  Maybe I'm little Nicky.  Oh, maybe I'm the guy that plays the golf.  Happy Gilmore.  I think that's Willie Nelson.  Oh, no.  It's not Willie Nelson.  It's me.  Oh.  How, how, how, how, maybe I.  Ugh.  Jesus.  Wow.  One of the Bananarama broads is a beast.  Yeah.  She looks like a bulldike.  Wow.  Oh, man. 
[02:20:00]  Look at the other one.  The other one held up, though.  No, she did.  But she was so cute in the, back in the Bananarama days.  Yeah.  I would like to ram my banana in Bananarama.  Ah.  Jeez.  She has a giant, shiny forehead.  She does.  She's probably wearing the handkerchiefs on her head.  Oh, God.  Because she probably hated her giant, shiny forehead her whole life.  Willie.  It's not Willie.  It's not Willie.  Oh, Willie.  Really?  Good morning, Teddy.  You've had a lot of arrests. 
[02:20:30]  Oh, Willie.  You've had a lot of kids.  Let's just leave.  On the road again.  Okay, Willie.  Say it.  I just can't wait to get on.  Okay.  It's 7 o'clock in the morning.  Willie, really.  It's very early.  Maybe you can answer our malarkey for us.  Some celebrity has come out with a memoir called Roll Me Up and Smoke Me When I Die.  Who is it?  Join me at Farm Aid.  Did you say join me at Farm Aid?  It's me, Willie Nelson.  Oh, it's you.  Oh, my goodness.  All right.  You're crazy.  Oh, are you still?  Crazy for the show. 
[02:21:00]  He's got a great voice, but I...  Thank you, Willie.  Scared straight, I'm hoping.  This fucking guy is great.  Fucking hilarious.  Yeah, Jim always likes these fucking Ducktober little comedic bits.  That guy's amazing.  Wow.  Yeah, I thought it was Willie Nelson on the phone.  It's not Willie.  Close your eyes.  Oh, it is?  Was it?  Yeah, because they said Willie Nelson's on the phone.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He was like, oh, the hotlines.  You hear it.  He's like, oh, he's throwing a little.  Oh, the hotlines ring. 
[02:21:30]  Why didn't he do any pot jokes, though?  I don't understand.  Oh, boy.  I just hope a dog doesn't walk in front of Willie Nelson and he breaks character.  Malarkey isn't over, guys.  No.  It continues.  That's right.  With Ted and Amy and Syracuse.  All right, one of those is the real one.  Those that heard that one.  I say it's Snoop Dogg slash Snoop Lion.  I say it's Matthew McConaughey.  And Willie Nelson says it's him.  Steven, you're caller 10.  Who's coming out with a book called Roll Me Up and Smoke Me When I Die?  Um, Willie?  You think it's Willie Nelson?  I think it is Willie Nelson. 
[02:22:00]  Jeannie, you get to choose between me or Amy.  Who's telling the truth?  I'm going to go out with you, Ted.  You think I'm telling you?  Snoop Lion.  Snoop Dogg slash Snoop Lion.  I know who it is.  I love you.  Oh.  Yul Brynner!  See, Roll Me Up and Smoke Me.  I'm dead.  They only have one Wednesday gift certificate to give away?  Yeah.  And so...  Could you at least bring somebody?  Mmm, I don't know.  Probably not.  They're giving away a Wednesday night.  A Wednesday night.  And they only have the one. 
[02:22:30]  The tapenaki.  This stupid restaurant's like, look, you know.  Yeah.  Once the first person...  You can't have Friday reception.  Oh.  But once the first person guesses who it obviously is...  Yeah.  The other two have to guess...  It involves more of the listeners in one contest.  Even though they're only giving away one prize, right?  Yeah.  And so, like, now that the first guy picked Willie Nelson...  Right.  It's almost like you're the last guy picked for the sports team.  So the third person on the phone has to just pick whoever nobody else picked.  Default.  Yes.  By default. 
[02:23:00]  Lion.  Snoop Dogg slash Snoop Lion.  Kim, you're a caller 12.  You get stuck with Amy's answer.  You think Matthew McConaughey is coming out with that book?  Sure.  Well...  He's cleaning up his act.  He just recently got married and all.  He's married.  Believe it or not, the truth teller today was me!  You got it right off the bat, Stephen!  Willie!  Actually, no, it was Willie Nelson, actually, that was telling the truth.  It's Willie Nelson.  Willie Nelson was telling the truth.  Steve got it.  Congratulations.  Itchy bond, 50 bucks, you crazy kid, all right?  That's a lot of sushi, speaking of rolling things up.  Stephen, you hang on the line.  You're a winner with 93Q, the number one hit music station. 
[02:23:30]  They gave away $50 for a Wednesday night?  And he got his own bit wrong.  Yeah, and he fucking got the bit wrong.  He announced that he was the correct answer when, in fact, it was Willie Nelson.  Of course it was.  It's not him.  I know it's not New York City, but 50 bucks with a date doesn't go fucking far.  Well, maybe there it does.  Maybe in Syracuse.  I don't know.  No.  If you have a few wobbly pops.  You know what first prize should be?  First prize should be?  If all of a sudden your radio just blows up.  Breaking news!  Oh? 
[02:24:00]  Oh?  The 93Q radio station Facebook page is down.  Why?  That one, too?  Yeah.  Yes, it is.  That's confirmed.  Oh, man.  Wow.  I wonder why that would happen.  I don't know.  You know, Facebook...  That's double points, though.  I don't know what the deal is with Facebook.  Their site's going down.  Oh, yeah.  Hmm.  Yeah, it's gone.  Oh, man.  It's too bad.  38 dead in a ferry crash in Hong Kong.  You know, I heard something about Hong Kong.  Don't make more.  Really?  Yes. 
[02:24:30]  Apparently, King Kong...  Right.  ...went to Hong Kong to play ping pong with his ding dong.  I heard that.  So that's also breaking news.  That's a fucking old rhyme, stupid.  Oh, thanks, Chip.  Let it go, Chip.  Thank you.  All right.  We're on our last clip.  Yeah.  Yep.  Yeah, technically, it's the last clip.  Well, we could do bonus today.  Bonus, uh, Jacktober. 
[02:25:00]  Well, first...  Because we do have the slumber party video.  Ah, slumber party video.  It depends on how you feel about the last clip.  Did you look at the time length of the last clip?  Oh, no.  It's long.  Yeah, it's not long.  How good?  What is it?  Well, it's titled, How Long Can You Sit Through Amy's Story?  Oh, no!  It's an Amy's story?  Mm-hmm.  Ugh, it's gonna be bad.  What's the story about?  It's a slice-of-life anecdote.  Ooh.  Just like, you know how you guys come in here and tell personal stories?  I'll tell a personal story.  Sure.  Jim tells personal stories, you know, chasing the bus.  Chasing the bus. 
[02:25:30]  Can I guess what it's about?  Oh, sure.  It's about the time that she had too many drinks and fell down the steps and the impact  caused her to diarrhea shit into her pantyhose and then it filled up her cunt and she had  to go to the hospital to have her cunt scooped out because she was afraid of getting fecal  madder in her cunt waltz again.  That's what I think it was about.  Is Jimmy right?  Is that?  Is that?  And she split her head open. 
[02:26:00]  He's off.  She was really...  That's my guess is that her heel broke as she was going down the steps and she was texting.  She was texting a photo of her clit to the not-white janitor and then she fell and shat her pantyhose  and had liquid shit in her cunt shat and it went all the way down to her ankles and she's  fucking laying there laughing her balls off.  There you go. 
[02:26:30]  Holy shit.  Do you want to hear Amy's story?  You'll see how right I was.  And also Dr. Steve, who I now call Needy Steve, is sending us powdered peanut butter.  Oh, really?  So we're going to try it.  Thank you, Dr. Steve.  Cool.  So speaking of construction, I met a last-minute merger in BJ's the other day. 
[02:27:00]  A last-minute merger?  Which I know.  How do you know he was a last-minute merger?  Well, because I just know the attitude.  Did he come up to you and say...  No.  He was a last-minute merger in the line of getting out of BJ's.  So I know that.  I've called...  You're cutting line, I guess.  Or a last-minute merger.  Like, you go up to where a lane is closed, and then you jump right in, instead of orderly  getting into the line of traffic.  Don't you just call a guy an asshole?  Why is it a last-minute merger?  Because you're merging at the last minute. 
[02:27:30]  Is it part of their show lingo?  Very upsetting.  I bet you they talk about last-minute mergers a lot.  And you don't want to say the a-hole word that early in the morning.  No, the children.  Well, you know what it was?  In high school, apparently, she was known as a merger lover.  She would always bed mergers, and her father said,  Don't ever bring no merger home.  And don't ever have no merger, baby.  Because I won't hug it.  He was a last-minute merger in the line of getting out of BJ's. 
[02:28:00]  So I know that.  I've called the whole attitude.  Wait a minute.  A last-minute merger getting out.  Those of you that go into the BJ's or something like that.  Are you talking to the self-checkout line?  All of us have to kind of merge.  What, did he cut his cart in front of yours?  As we're leaving BJ's or a place like that.  Because we're all...  Are you talking about the parking lot or inside at the register,  you fucking bitch?  I think the parking lot.  Before it was the register.  Was it?  Before.  Oh, before, yeah.  What?  What?  I don't know what she's talking about merging into. 
[02:28:30]  The line for the register with your cart  or the fucking parking lot with a car.  I actually did hear this story.  Oh, did you do, Jimmy?  What happened was there was a last-minute merger,  and she got stuck at the light,  and he said,  and you know how I am, Ted.  I have to take a vegetable juice shit in the afternoon.  She drinks a giant beet juice,  and she shat in the car.  And she says that I had to pull over into the shoulder  and aim my asshole over the ashtray. 
[02:29:00]  She's trying to hold it back like the elevated doors in the shining.  Big red beady shit.  I had my fucking...  I had my stomach up in the air,  and I was trying to straighten out my back  so I didn't make a duty on my seat.  A hat on those tan slacks that you hate?  Oh, yeah, the ones that show your camel toe.  That's right, Ted.  Stupid.  All right, I guess we don't have to play the rest of the story.  I'm just guessing.  I could be wrong.  Oh, I thought that was the real...  Whew. 
[02:29:30]  All right.  Wait a minute.  A last-minute merger.  All right, those of you that go into the MBJs  or something like that...  The checkout line?  All of us have to kind of merge...  What, did he cut his cart in front of yours?  As we're leaving BJ's or a place like that  because we're all...  We have the self-checkout.  Where the security guy checks your receipt?  Yes, yes.  Is that what you're talking about?  Yes.  And, okay, so I'm not a lally gagger.  I always obey all grocery cart rules  because I'm all about people that are really, really slow.  You're in BJ's.  I'm in BJ's.  I'm leaving BJ's.  With your cart full of stuff. 
[02:30:00]  And I'm...  Yeah, and I'm not walking slow or fast.  I'm just merging into the line as I do.  And you're waiting for the security guy  to check your receipt before you go through the door.  Well, I'm headed toward there.  My wheels are rolling still.  And all of a sudden,  I hear this loud wheel behind me.  And I turn,  and there's a gentleman getting in front of me.  We call that a cart last-minute merger.  So I stop.  No, we don't.  Because, you know, God forbid...  I don't think I've ever seen that happen.  God forbid...  What, is he in a little bit of a hurry?  He gets there two seconds before I do.  And he must have seen my look.  And he went,  Oh, go ahead. 
[02:30:30]  And I went,  Oh, no, no, no.  You go ahead.  Uh-huh.  So, then I follow him out  because he, you know,  got there two seconds before I did.  That doesn't end well.  What happens was  when they're getting into their cars,  he takes his cart,  and he rams it into her shins,  and he calls her a cunt.  Oh, that's awful.  He gives her what they call  the old cart shinning.  Calls her a cunt.  I love Jimmy's stories on the...  You know what it was? 
[02:31:00]  She was loading.  She bought two boxes of tampons  because she's a bleeder.  Or she goes to BJ's  so she can buy cunt plugs  by the fucking bulk.  And he rams his cart into his shins  and just called her a cunt.  And then she fell half into the trunk.  There really are people around here  that don't like Jocktober, huh?  Yeah, come on.  I have heard that.  Wow.  It just brings so much to the show.  We get stories from Jimmy.  They don't see it. 
[02:31:30]  Holy fuckaroni.  So, then I follow him out  because he, you know,  got there two seconds before I did.  You do know you're talking about a store.  Right.  So he's throwing everything in his truck,  and what do I call it  as I'm wheeling out to my car?  I go, let me guess.  He's not going to put his cart back  in the cart return.  Oh, shit.  Because God forbid  he spends a minute longer  wheeling the cart back.  No, that's Wendy.  Wendy Sunday.  So he throws the cart into the...  This sounds like a Fez story. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, man.  It does, right?  Oh, no.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  She is...  What is she doing?  She's a busy body.  Play some Katy Perry.  Yeah.  Fuck you, you nosy body.  You nosy body.  Now she's studying the guy?  I guess.  Who gives a fuck  where he leaves his cart?  And do you think all this happened  and she was like,  oh, man, I gotta get on the air  and talk about this tomorrow?  This is...  Let me jot this down 
[02:32:30]  because I need to remember this story.  I think I'm going to save it  for the 7.30 break.  Yeah.  You know what?  Because that's when  the most people are listening.  Oh, you know, Ted,  he did put the cart back,  but do you think it's okay  if I say he didn't?  Oh, it just adds a layer  to the story.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't like being dishonest  with the listener,  but it sort of punches up the story.  Yeah, do it, do it,  you fucking whore.  ...cart return  because, God forbid,  he spends a minute longer 
[02:33:00]  wheeling the cart back.  This guy had a whole...  No, and it's windy.  Windy Sunday.  No, this guy had a whole attitude.  He throws the cart  into the woods,  or the field there,  you know,  because he's a little...  He threw his cart  into a field?  Wheels are over  because, you know,  he's leaving.  So it doesn't matter  if his cart actually  hits another car  because that's not his problem.  He threw his cart  into the field?  And I happen to be  right in the same line as him,  so I'm wheeling.  Now I'm slow.  Uh-huh.  Right as I soon...  As soon as I put this truck  in reverse  and I'm right behind his truck  and I'm thinking,  I'm trying to prove a point,  but if he runs me over  in his pickup truck, 
[02:33:30]  this is probably a point that I...  You developed parking lot road rage  because the guy cut you off  at the security checkpoint  at BJ's.  I just called an attitude.  I can say...  Then he got on the highway.  I know how this ends.  I actually remember.  Yes, Jim.  And then he got out of the car  and he hit me in the spine  with that same bat  that Snake Plissken used  and escaped from New York.  And he called me a busybody hole  and said my radio show stinks.  And then he fucking pushed me 
[02:34:00]  to the ground  and I skinned my knees  because he hit the fucking  fleshy part of my spine  with a fucking...  A bat with a nail through it.  Then he pushed me out of the car.  He started to touch me.  He threw my BJ's bag  in the ground.  He pushed his cot into my car.  He pushed the cot.  Oh, God.  I hate her.  Off at the security checkpoint  at BJ's.  I just called an attitude.  I can say...  Then he got on the highway. 
[02:34:30]  He was a last-minute merger.  I can call the whole attitude  just by seeing the way  that he merged,  last-minute merge,  to BJ's.  So your blood pressure  is peaking.  And you think...  I'm just saying that really...  And you think he's the one  that's got the problem?  You're in such a hurry  that why bother  being nice to anyone else  around you?  He started slamming  into the back of his truck  on the way out  of the parking lot.  Was that not  what I should have done?  And he's the one  with the problem.  You really might want to...  Because he's a little bit  busier than all the rest of us. 
[02:35:00]  You really want to call  a therapist.  I think the one with issues  may not necessarily be him.  Keep fucking that chicken.  O-M-G.  O-M-G.  Wow.  Well, that clip  didn't make me howl.  No howling?  No howling there.  It was not phenomenal.  I had nothing to repeat.  It seemed like they 
[02:35:30]  kind of just stopped talking.  I don't know  what happened there.  No, they just talked  for a long time.  I know what it is, actually.  Oh, you do, Jimmy?  He actually has a sign  he holds up  that says,  Shut up, cunt.  How great would that be?  Oh, man.  Jesus, Jimmy.  And you notice that  she just completely  plows over  any questions  that he asks?  Of course she does. 
[02:36:00]  He was asking questions.  That's what stupid  Jenny Hutt  was doing yesterday.  Nothing of interest  had been said.  No end to the story  had been sent.  500 listeners  go into the water.  500 listeners  turn off the radio.  Do you bring every story  that happens to you  in between shows  to the program?  No.  Yeah, I don't either.  You try to keep them.  Amy, you might want 
[02:36:30]  to fucking decide  which stories  to bring to the show.  Somewhat interesting,  compelling.  If that's the best thing  to happen to you.  Demon quality.  Hey, can we play  a little bit of  the slumber party video  before we take a break  before our big guest?  Yes, please.  Why not, right?  Please.  I'm calling this  Bonus Jocktober.  Bonus Jocktober.  Bonus Jocktober.  We found out that  I guess Amy  from Ted and Amy  in Syracuse.  She does this  slumber party  every year  for the women  so they can escape  their lives  for a day.  Watch this be  the hottest video ever. 
[02:37:00]  Amy's dipping her feet  in some girl's mouth  and the other one's  strap on  fucking her friend.  They're calling it  Soccer Moms Gone Wild.  Oh.  Yeah, and they're all  at this big event.  They got their jammies on.  So what,  they take over  a convention room  or something  in a dumb hotel?  I hate when they do  that stupid art thing  they do  where they all put  different color paint  on their vaginas  and they squat on paper  and make slugs.  And they sell it 
[02:37:30]  for charity.  They go to the hotel  where they got one  of those big glass block walls  and stick their guns  against it like sucker fish.  They say,  let's play clean  the algae off the tank.  Or then they read  like news stories  and they read  what the criminal has done  and they all play  guess the ethnicity.  It's like a really  horrible racist slumber party.  That cop that punched  that girl in Philly.  There's one factor  they're leaving out.  Oh, yes, exactly.  So what,  we gotta get  to slumber party. 
[02:38:00]  Yes, of course.  Oh, please.  Amy demands it.  They sing,  I,  they're all dancing  in big glasses.  And they got those  giant glasses  which are always funny.  Amy's slumber party.  Soccer bombs got wild.  Look at these frumps.  They're all frumps.  Oh.  Oh, God.  This is the sixth annual  Amy's slumber party.  Oh, look at that pig.  We're now at 800  for two nights in a row.  So 1,600 women.  And it still sells out 
[02:38:30]  in a day.  It's amazing.  Women spend  so much time  taking care of other people  that, you know,  they're taking care  of their kids  and their families  and making sure  you pause right there.  This is so calculated.  She obviously  isn't wearing makeup  because we're all  just letting our hair  down for a night.  Just girls hanging out.  We don't have to  press each other.  We don't have to  press each other.  Come with your PJs  or your sweatpants.  Yeah, yeah.  Great.  Oh, boy.  She has hair like Ed Harris.  It really is. 
[02:39:00]  A balding lady.  Really is.  This is the one night  where they can just  focus on themselves  and care for themselves  and be with their friends.  Oh, they've got funny ears on.  Fatzos.  They don't have to worry  about designating a driver.  Cowboy hats.  Gangs.  And just worry  about themselves  all the big beds.  They're all laying  down in the beds.  They're all dancing  having fun.  What a look  at these fat fucking pigs.  I would hate to be there.  You wouldn't enjoy that?  No. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, God.  They're all having a ball  dancing in a fucking circle.  They're doing conga lines.  The big fat cell with a mullet.  Dancing, drinking champagne.  Oh, this is horrid.  And the husbands  know that they're all night  so they're just  fucking the neighbor.  Exactly.  Every one of them  is going to have chlamydia  or herpes in their life  from home.  And they're doing  everything they want.  Oh, caricature drawers.  There's shopping.  There's over 100 booths  and shoes and jewelry.  They get to get  their hair done.  They get to get  their eyebrows waxed.  Just a night of pampering 
[02:40:00]  and fun for the ladies.  And that's all women need.  We'll all sit to the same bed.  Get up and take the kids  to soccer the next day.  But just this one night,  they're just focused  on themselves.  And I just think  that that's really cool.  It's not cool.  Oh, no.  It's the big dance.  A bunch of ladies.  They're singing ACDC.  Yeah.  Oh, exactly.  Oh, no, God.  There.  That is a room full of 
[02:40:30]  fucking threes and fours.  Yeah.  How many do you think  dyke out by the end  of the night?  Every one of them.  They're all drinking.  Oh, there's a man.  Karaoke.  I wish they were  having this in the  fucking same place  Great White had their  concert.  That's a Munchhausen  Syndrome by Proxy song  for the baby.  You shook me all night long.  Shake the baby. 
[02:41:00]  It's in itself just so fun.  You think about what  would guys do if it would  be something similar.  And it would have to be  an activity on how to get  rid of those little  noises and have fun.  Watch a game.  Whereas women create an  event.  I mean, this is an event  Sympathy for the ladies  that only sell out  half the shirt.  That's an event by  itself.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[02:41:30]  They let the blacks  purchase me.  They're all wearing  funny teeth and wigs.  Like a costume thing.  Grandma gone wild.  Everything is gone wild.  I'm from Auburn, New York.  This is my first time here.  Oh, really?  Oh, I'm having a great time.  Stalker Patty has 20 years.  Mike Chester.  I'm wearing my social  and a bunch of cows dancing. 
[02:42:00]  Oh, yeah.  It's a whole fucking  terrible band with Amy's slumber party shirts  and a bunch of cows dancing.  You should hold us in a fucking barn.  They're all standing in hay.  Just shitting without moving.  I think the husbands feel good about it.  They're not out,  crowsing,  or at bars.  You know, 
[02:42:30]  they don't have to worry  about the opposite sex.  For God's sakes,  we all wear night shirts  and we're not really worried  about looking glamorous.  We're just here to have fun  and just to hang with our friends.  And so I think that's a good way  the husbands feel comfortable  about letting their wives  go away for a night as well.  So all in all,  it's a win-win.  I don't know.  That's how we started it  and we're going to continue it.  I can't imagine.  I think there would be a mutiny  if I stopped doing this.  It's terrible.  Wow.  That looks like a nightmare. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah.  That just looks like a nightmare.  Yeah.  Do you think they're licking  whipped cream off dicks  later in the night?  Yeah,  they're probably bringing  those bachelorette parties  we've seen.  It's like,  whoa,  there's a crowd  and they're being  a little loud.  That must be why  the cops are showing up.  You know,  the cops with the big mustaches  and fucking,  what is he doing?  I don't recognize  that uniform.  Why is,  he's got his cuffs out.  He's cuffing one of the girls.  Wow,  he just ripped his pants off. 
[02:43:30]  Wait a minute.  He's wearing shorts.  He's got a giant rod.  Wow.  Let's dance.  So there you have it  for today's  Jog Tover.  What do we got for tomorrow, Sam?  Do you know?  I know,  but nobody will know  until tomorrow.  How about a little hint?  A little tease?  What part of the country?  Well,  we're going to stay  in the U.S.  Okay.  What kind of show? 
[02:44:00]  We'll probably lean  more top 40.  Mm-hmm.  Kind of morning zoo-ish?  Yeah.  I like that.  Is it Scott and Todd time?  Is there a hole?  I don't know.  I mean,  there's a young lady  who helps the show along,  but I don't know  if you want to insult her.  Does she keep the guys in line?  A little bit.  I don't know  if you want Scott and Todd yet.  It's so early in the month.  It's like having  all your Christmas presents  at once.  I don't know why  you're going to lose  my life.  I mean,  we were going to  a radio for a long time. 
[02:44:30]  I'm an old  fat nagle kid  who's still on.  I don't know.  I thought of a radio.  Eric,  they're talking about you.  You know,  it's,  people,  it's mergers.  They merge,  but they don't  merge any  and leave their  carts all around.  Scott Shannon's  doing the merging.  I got you.  I don't know  what's,  why they merge  and push the cart  and I,  who's going to use the cart?  Oh,  oh. 
[02:45:00]  You know?  And then,  and then a song parody.  We're merging,  merging,  merging,  merging.  We're merging.  It doesn't even make sense.  Oh,  shoehorning in the words.  Because then  we're going to merge.  All right,  we get this.  Oh,  yeah.  I love when Scott Shannon  talks about that  little fat nagle kid.  Oh,  is that great?  Yeah.  Well,  for a long time,  well,  fat kid,  you just look up for it.  I was just a big fat,  consuming adult. 
[02:45:30]  He doesn't even shave.  His arm gets tired  going around his big neck.  Well,  he's from Florida originally.  Yeah.  Right here.  Pretty cool,  huh?  He used to drive a boat  to school.  He did,  he used to drive a boat  to school.  Yeah.  How cool is that?  That's pretty cool.  That's pretty fucking cool.  You got a high school  in a boat?  Yeah.  Caracut like a special  Olympics participant.  I had a green Aspen wagon.  Yeah?  Yeah.  It's not a boat.  And the back doors 
[02:46:00]  wouldn't close.  Just devil make hair  in a boat.  Fucking just squirting  sun in in his hair  and just fucking  flying to school.  Exactly.  Mirrors, shades.  Oh, yeah.  Treats at his feet.  Maybe a nice sun kiss  and a five alive.  All kinds of jolly ranchers  all around the boat.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  As many as you could eat.  Kenny,  he's saying girls got on.  Oh, yeah.  They didn't.  They didn't.  No.  Sierra Mist.  I'll read some  some WWE fan fiction  that Nagel wrote.  That faction loves wrestling.  He always loves wrestling. 
[02:46:30]  Bob Backlund does the D-Walk.  Go to our website  and you can see  some of the Lego creations  that Nagel's made.  Yeah, he should make himself  a Lego stool  and a Lego rope.  We got a break  because we got our big guest  coming up next.  Yes.  Yes.  How do you say his name?  Cary Ells?  Ells.  Ells.  Ells.  Celebrating the 25th anniversary  of the Princess Bride.  And for the people out there  trying to help you  with Jocktober,  what's your email there, Sam? 
[02:47:00]  Just Twitter, not Sam.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Anything.  Anything you think  might fly for Jocktober.  You can suggest a show.  Maybe there's a weird bit  that you think  is perfect for it.  I generally...  Maybe some of those  radio station slogans.  Yeah.  Think out of the box  on this for us.  Anything.  And don't be afraid  because I generally know  within a minute  of listening to a show  whether or not  it's Jocktober.  It's not necessarily  just a show.  Right.  If it's a weird bit,  a weird song parody,  just anything  that would fit  the Jocktober thing, 
[02:47:30]  send it to Sam, please.  Just tweet, not Sam.  That was a clever way  to get a Twitter plug  there, sir.  I'm not going to go  through an email box.  I can just favorite tweets.  Oh, Ted and Amy  have a Twitter.  I just hope  no one's been hassling that.  Leave the Twitter alone.  What's their Twitter?  Just Ted and Amy,  but I mean,  just leave it alone.  Oh, let's check.  Let's check their mentions.  Real quick, yeah.  I hope no one's bothering them.  I'm sure, I'm sure  they're cool.  I didn't even know  until I just saw them.  Don't bother them.  Their time is over.  They made it through Jocktober.  Yeah, congrats.  We will forget about them tomorrow.  Unfortunately,  this show replays twice.  Oh.  Oops.  Oh.  Oh.  Okay, so there's just them 
[02:48:00]  just being fine and everything.  How many followers?  How many followers they got?  1181.  Yeah.  Not bad.  Well, I'm not good.  No.  I just do  at Ted and Amy.  Don't touch me.  Don't touch me.  Stop it, Edgar.  Edgar's poking.  I'm very uncomfortable.  We work in a place  where you have to say  don't touch me a lot.  Don't touch me.  Oh, jeez.  Wait, what happened, Sam?  I don't know.  Barry Bullshitter wrote something.  Yeah, Barry Bullshitter.  What happened?  He left a twit pic 
[02:48:30]  of a girl.  We all appreciated  a good twit pic.  With a 14-inch  or 15-inch black cock  on her shoulder.  Yeah, and she's topless  and just the 15-inch penis  is draped over her shoulder.  That's terrible.  It might be one of their listeners.  Like you would a fire hose  if you were fighting a fire hose.  And that's mean.  They said they should change  the name of the Slumber Party  to Pigs in a Blanket.  Oh.  Oh, look at this.  Ted and Amy  just made me shit so hard  I feel like I was ass-raped  from the inside out.  Oh, wow.  I hope you win today's show  the way our Bud Dwyer 
[02:49:00]  ends in press conference.  Oh, he killed himself.  These guys are fucking brutal.  Just bad, nasty people.  Oh, my God.  This is a picture that says  Is this Amy?  And it's a picture of a girl smoking,  but it's like a warning ad.  This could happen to you  if you smoke too much.  Yeah.  And she's got just terrible teeth  and gums and her eye is gone.  Sure, not good.  Not good.  Not good.  This isn't constructive.  Look at this.  Like, Ted and Amy  might only read the first part of this. 
[02:49:30]  They say,  At Ted and Amy,  thanks for making my morning better.  Period.  And the next sentence is,  Not with your actual radio show,  it's horrible,  but with joining us for Jocktober.  David Thompson writes,  Have a nice day,  forehead duo.  Oh, no.  Rob's bulbous uvula  just wrote the word cunt  over and over and over.  That's not even nice. 
[02:50:00]  Oh, I don't do it.  Oh, wow.  Ted Sheckler,  I guess Ted Sheckler would know.  He wrote that Amy's vagina  smells worse than the dumpster  behind Popeye's.  Oh, that's a terrible smelling dumpster.  That's, uh...  You need your hats removed  by a battering ram.  What type of suggestion is that?  Come on.  No.  Oh, uh...  Jay from Huntington.  Oh.  It's Pink Socktober,  Ted and Amy.  And that's no malarkey. 
[02:50:30]  Retweet for the hashtag  prolapsed anus.  This isn't right.  This can't be their fans.  No.  You sure?  I don't know.  Uh...  I mean,  they just keep going and going.  At Ted and Amy,  remember when you had  a good morning radio show?  Neither does anyone else.  Welcome to Jocktober.  Who preps the bull  on your morning drive?  Ted and Amy in the morning.  This must be such a surprise  because it comes out of nowhere. 
[02:51:00]  You're just doing your show  for years and years and years.  Oh, I must have said something good.  I got a bunch of mentions  on my Twitter.  Why do we have a bunch of mentions?  Yeah.  And why is there Facebook?  What the fuck has happened?  Yeah.  And out of nowhere...  You have to deal with this horse shit.  Oh, it's terrible.  Right, you have like, uh...  Like one tweet,  it goes,  I can't wait to hear  your body  by Christina Aguilera  on Ted and Amy.  And then the next tweet  above that is,  hang on, kitties,  here it comes.  Oh. 
[02:51:30]  And then the tweets start.  We better break.  Oh, look at this.  It says, uh,  Terry Clifford says hi.  Hey, there's Terry Clifford.  Hey, Terry Clifford.  Terry Clifford.  Oh, yeah, let's break.  I gotta piss.  Yeah, okay.  I can't wait for Terry Clifford day.  Oh, yeah.  Sirius XM.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  All right, we had fun today.  A lot of fun today.  The fun continues.  Yeah.  Uh, Carrie's here.  Yes, Carrie Elwes. 
[02:52:00]  Carrie Elwes.  I'll make sure I can say his name right.  Carrie Elwes.  Elwes.  Is he heavy?  I don't know.  We're gonna find out.  Hey, Carrie, how are you?  There we go.  Carrie.  How you doing?  How you doing?  Hi.  Pleasure.  Fan.  Hi, Jim.  How are you?  Fan.  Hi, coming all the way around.  I like this.  Oh.  Pleasure to meet you, sir.  All right.  Cool.  Now, are we saying your last name?  It's Elvis, right?  Elvis.  Okay.  Carrie Elwes.  It's a hard one to say for some reason.  I know.  It's like Elvis, but with a W. 
[02:52:30]  Oh, okay.  Elvis.  Oh, that makes perfect sense.  There you go.  That's a lot easier.  Yeah, that helps people.  Are you filming?  Yeah, we always just said.  Oh, okay.  You can tell him to turn that fucking camera off if you want.  That's fine.  He's got a viral video, so he's looking to follow up with it.  He's looking for the follow up.  He went to the Apple store during the release of the iPhone 5 and got some girl that had no  idea why she was online to buy the iPhone.  She was excited for it.  Right.  But had no idea what the phone did or anything.  And it got 4.5 million. 
[02:53:00]  4.8.  4.8.  Sorry.  No kidding.  Million views.  But how?  Yeah.  So he's very excited.  We learned today, though, he hired an actress and it's all fake.  It could be fake.  Yeah.  We're investigating.  Yeah, we are investigating.  Wow.  What do we got?  The 25th, is it?  Yeah.  Anniversary of The Princess Bride.  Crazy.  That is crazy.  What a great quotable movie.  Thank you.  A lot of people quote that movie.  Yeah.  And a favorite.  Wow.  So you're out and about talking about The Princess Bride.  Yeah. 
[02:53:30]  Boy, how'd you get that part?  That was pretty good.  I was blessed, man.  I don't know how I got it.  Honestly, look at the cast.  Yeah.  You know, Billy Crystal, Chris Guest.  You know, I grew up with these guys.  I mean, Spinal Tap.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Please.  You know?  Yeah.  And Chris Saranen from Dog Day Afternoon and Carol Kane from Annie Hall and Wally Sean,  My Dinner with Andre.  I thought, how am I going to fit into this group?  Yeah.  I'd only made all of two movies at that point.  What had you made before that? 
[02:54:00]  I'd made something called Lady Jane with Helena Bonham Carter.  And I made a film called Another Country with Colin Firth.  So I'd done a couple of little movies, but this was the big one for me.  Yeah, that was the big one right there.  So I was a little intimidated.  Yeah.  You know, it's quite impressive company to find myself in.  Yeah, yeah.  But, you know, they all welcomed me very, very, they were very sweet.  We had a blast.  Yeah.  A blast, yeah.  I also just remembered, actually, somebody reminded me that you were Dr. Jonas Miller in Twister. 
[02:54:30]  Right.  Who got lifted up to his death and doom.  Correct.  Because you wouldn't listen to The Extreme!  The Extreme!  Yeah!  It's already here!  That's funny.  Oh, boy.  You like that movie?  I cannot get enough of Twister.  Really?  Because that whole, um, uh, what would it, is there any such thing as an F5?  And the guy, you just hear his fork drop. 
[02:55:00]  That's like, what would that be like?  Finger of God.  They're so overdramatic with their storm chasing.  I know.  I liked your guys better.  You were high tech.  Yeah.  Sponsored.  Yeah.  Reasonable.  Not emotional.  Yeah.  They're playing friggin' Van Halen.  Yeah!  Yeah!  All the real storm chasers we work with were like, you know, that's not how we do things.  Of course not!  They're a bunch of nerdy geeks, as a matter of fact.  There's no competition between the storm chasers?  Like, they don't, like...  They're not sponsorable? 
[02:55:30]  There's no good guys and bad guys?  Well, I persuaded the producers much against their consternation.  Much to their consternation, I persuaded the producer, Kathy Kennedy.  I asked her, I said, listen, I, you know, I got all this downtime and there's a storm  coming, because we had a meteorologist on the set.  I said, there's a storm coming.  It's over the border in Pretty Prairie in Texas.  Can I go?  And she's like, absolutely not.  And we're not insured for that.  There's no way.  And I wore her down.  I just kept wearing her down.  I'm like, come on.  I'll take someone with me.  I'll take a storm chaser.  He knows what he's doing. 
[02:56:00]  I'll have a walkie-talkie.  It'll all be good.  Finally, she said, okay, fine.  But I want you in constant contact.  I want your cell phone on.  I want everything.  All right.  I said, fine.  Yeah, great, great.  So off I go, right?  And we drive down there.  And as we're heading down there, we see all these cars leaving Pretty Prairie and they're  waving at us like, you're crazy.  Get out of here.  You're going the wrong way.  And we turn this corner and suddenly there's this twister.  And I was driving and the storm chaser goes, reverse.  He just starts out very quietly. 
[02:56:30]  He goes, reverse.  I go, what?  He goes, reverse right now.  Oh, man.  And I go, oh, shit.  I put the car in reverse.  And man, that thing was on us within.  We got out of there by the hair of our chin.  You shouldn't have listened to him.  Yeah, just like Bill.  Just like Bill.  Bill tried to warn you.  And what did you do?  You kept driving.  Even the guy in the passenger seat tried to say, maybe you should listen.  But I couldn't hear him.  I couldn't hear him from the noise.  He was like talking, you know.  Yeah, maybe that was it.  What kind of music were you listening to as you were riding toward the storm? 
[02:57:00]  Were you listening to REO, Speedwagon, Riding the Storm Out?  Riders on the Storm.  I will watch that movie every single time it's on and sit there and just get mad at it.  Thank you.  It's already here.  He's ESP with the tornado.  Were you happy with the way it came out?  You can never tell when you're shooting something because you're not seeing everybody else's scenes.  Once you saw it put together.  It was amazing.  You know, it was written by Michael Crichton and it was an incredible cast.  I mean, look at the cast now. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah, yeah.  John Hunt, Bill Paxton, Philip Seymour Hoffman.  Bill Paxton's always this guy.  Come on, man.  Why don't you put her in charge?  I love Bill Paxton.  In everything, he's that guy.  Jamie Gertz.  Oh, yeah.  Who's Jamie Gertz?  She's great.  Yeah, she's gone away a little bit.  I know her name, though.  We haven't seen her in a while.  Yeah, she's terrific.  She's a big actress for the time.  Wonderful, wonderful actor.  She's in a lot of stuff.  Really, really sweet, wonderful actor. 
[02:58:00]  What else was she in?  Because I know the name.  It's driving me...  Oh, man.  I don't know.  I just paid so much attention to Dusty and Rabbit.  All them fun guys.  Yeah.  Just turned up the volume.  Who was Dusty?  Philip Seymour Hoffman, right?  Philip Seymour Hoffman, who, yeah, is just an amazing actor.  And him and Boogie Nights.  And the film turned out, I thought it turned out pretty good.  It made a lot of money.  It absolutely did.  And I remember, when that came out, they did, like, entire news segments on the special effects. 
[02:58:30]  Right.  And how amazing the tornadoes looked and everything.  For its time, especially.  Yeah.  It looked amazing.  Also, Saw.  Yes.  The original Saw.  Yeah.  One of the best thrilling horror movies ever.  I mean, and the twist.  Yeah.  Just crazy.  Yeah.  Crazy.  And even if I mention it now, people would be like, spoiler!  Yeah.  When was it made?  Yeah.  But that is something that after you see it, the twist, you're like, how did I not see 
[02:59:00]  that?  How did I not consider that as a possibility?  Yeah.  Very bright guys.  That he's the freaking guy on the floor.  It's amazing.  Right, right, right.  But you, with the foot and everything, just a great claustrophobic horror.  What did you do acting for that movie to get yourself into that?  Yeah, because you've got to portray someone who's petrified.  Well, they chained us to the wall.  They really did chain us to the wall.  And they actually had to, in order for the camera to spin around 360 degrees, they actually 
[02:59:30]  had to have the painters put the set back together and seal the walls up.  So we were actually very claustrophobic.  Oh, okay.  We were really in there.  And then all the crew would hide behind the camera as they were spinning around.  Oh, they'd have to keep walking around.  Keep walking around it, you know?  And so, you know, being chained to a wall in the same clothes for week after week, well,  week after week, we only shot it in 18 days.  18 days?  Yeah.  Fuck.  That's amazing.  Well, it's just one set, really.  I mean, one location. 
[03:00:00]  Oh, Jimmy, oh, I guess then 18 days.  Well, no, I mean, I'm just throwing out some Hollywood genre.  When's your 18-day movie coming out?  When's your 18-day movie that made millions?  No, I'm not saying anything bad.  I'm only saying that's what cuts down on the time, as you know, locations and movies.  Yeah, we have one location.  That's all we could afford.  Men of similar ilk.  We shot at Lacey Studios.  Do you know where they shot Cagney and Lacey?  It's downtown L.A.  They call it Lacey Studios because of that?  Because of that.  Because that's where they shot the whole series.  Those Lacey underalls from a Caddyshack. 
[03:00:30]  No, we shot it all in this one location.  And so that saved a lot of money and time.  Yeah.  And yeah, no, it was...  We had no idea it would take off the way it did.  Yeah, yeah.  It really kind of struck a nerve, as they say, in the horror movie.  While severing a few tendrils.  Yes, yeah.  Yeah, it was one of those that...  It was a great mix of suspense and gore.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But the gore really had its...  When you have to friggin' ace your foot like that... 
[03:01:00]  Yeah.  Oh, you feel it.  Yeah.  And it was a great...  They did a great job of kind of feeling for your character, too.  Yeah.  You, like, felt bad for the guy.  Yeah, no.  Terrible situation.  Yeah, no.  I thought it was well-written.  These two guys, James Wan and Lee Wannell, they came out of Melbourne Film School.  Young kids in their 20s.  And they were passionate about this film.  And every studio turned them down.  Every single one.  They said, no, we don't get it.  It's too dark, too weird, too this, too that.  Wow.  And they were going to come up with their own money. 
[03:01:30]  They'd ask their grandparents and their aunts and their uncles and cousins to raise money  to make the film themselves.  They were just going to do it.  But that family's pissed they didn't.  Yeah.  And finally, this one company, you know, saw it.  Saw the little reel they made.  They made, like, a five-minute scene.  That they put together of the Bad Trap, the reverse Bad Trap.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And they looked at it and they went, you know what?  These guys have got something.  These guys are sick.  They've got something going on.  Were you in that original reel or no?  No.  They shot that themselves in Melbourne. 
[03:02:00]  Okay.  And, you know, when I met them, I met James Wan for lunch one day and he brought with him  this portfolio.  And he opened it up and he'd done all the artwork himself.  He designed everything.  The pig mask and the little doll and the reverse Bad Trap, which was a blueprint.  And I said, God, that looks really real.  He goes, oh, yeah.  It's operational.  But, you know, and he made the doll himself. 
[03:02:30]  It traveled with him first class.  Really?  It had its own seat.  I said, well, how were the stewardesses with that?  And he was like, they weren't too happy about it.  Kind of creep people out.  Kind of creep people out of it.  But I just couldn't risk packing him, putting him through luggage, you know?  And so, yeah.  Wow.  How much did it cost to make?  The doll?  No, the movie.  Oh, the movie.  A million dollars.  A million bucks.  Made a hundred million.  Jesus.  What a great investment that is, huh?  I hope you had some of that. 
[03:03:00]  I didn't.  Well, you had your suit on.  No, they didn't give me any.  But that's okay.  I was part of it.  Were you taken care of?  I mean, you had your legal issue.  I had some wrangling.  I had to go and ask for it, but whatever.  Boy.  It's amazing.  Nobody in Hollywood does the right thing.  Producers.  They were like, come and have fun.  We'll take care of you.  Don't worry.  You'll never have to work again.  Did I say that?  Did I really?  I don't remember saying that. 
[03:03:30]  Jeez, that sucked.  That was the last saw they did, where you're in the room with the producers.  Trying to get your money from it.  Right, exactly.  It's more terrifying than any other saw motor.  Trying to reach into the middle of the room for your check.  Right.  You've got to reach through the bear trap mask.  Right.  Totally.  It's terrible.  What about The Princess Bride?  You did pretty good on that one, I bet, right?  You know, I'm blessed.  It's like one of those films that has lasted forever.  It resonates from generation to generation.  It really does.  What do you think that's all about? 
[03:04:00]  I think because it's got a lot of heart.  Longevity.  It's got a lot of heart.  Yeah.  It's not cruel.  It's not mean.  It's sweet.  It's funny.  It's goofy.  It appeals to all ages.  You know, parents can watch it with their kids.  There's very few movies that have that.  Yeah.  You know?  And it's sort of just one of those things.  I don't know.  If I put my finger on it, I'd be a producer and produce a ton of them.  Yeah, and do another one like that.  Andre the Giant was in that.  Yes.  And did you get to hang out with him a lot?  Oh, please. 
[03:04:30]  He was amazing.  Yeah, I heard he liked drinking beer a lot, right?  No, God bless him.  Yeah, he drank something called the American, which was a combination of a lot of different things.  He had terrible back problems, you know?  Yeah, holding up that body.  Holding up that body.  And then people would jump on him on the canvas, you know?  They thought if he was big enough, he could handle it.  So wrestlers would literally just use him as a trampoline.  Oh, man.  Sam, is this true?  Sam knows everything about wrestling.  Right?  Am I right, Sam?  The Hulkster.  Did he ever wrestle Bob Backlund?  I don't know who that is, but I'm sure he is.  And well, you shouldn't. 
[03:05:00]  You're a successful guy and not some loser.  But he was such a sweet guy, you know?  He didn't care much for British catering, which, I mean, we're not known for culinary skills.  They think cholesterol is something you put in your car.  And he went over to France and brought back, you know, pâtés and foie gras for the crew.  And the crew just loved him for that.  Oh, man.  He was like, couldn't do no wrong after that.  I have bought some stuff for you.  He didn't have that giant guy voice.  No, no, no.  He was a sweet, sweet man. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah?  Sweet man.  Did you take photos with him?  I was with him every day.  I didn't get pictures with him.  There's a movie.  It's called The Prince's Front.  No, no, I know that.  It's a bunch of photos strung together that move when you play them in a machine, you dummy.  Hey, where are you guys doing the reunion today?  Uh-huh.  Where are you guys doing it?  It says the cast is doing a reunion today after a screening.  We're going to screen the movie at the New York Film Festival later this evening.  In Lincoln Center, right?  In Lincoln Center.  We're going to do it with the whole cast. 
[03:06:00]  Wow, really?  Chris Guest is the only one who can't make it.  He's out of town.  It's for a good cause, too, right?  Yes.  Yeah.  It's the Mercy Corps.  What's that?  Mercy Corps.  This is an organization I work with, a non-profit organization.  They're out of Portland.  They're amazing, these guys.  You know that saying, give a person a fish, feed them for a day, teach a person a fish,  feed them for a lifetime?  You make that up?  No.  Oh, I've never heard that.  I think it was Audrey Hepburn or something like that.  Audrey Hepburn.  No, really.  I'm serious.  So, anyway.  Buy him some fish. 
[03:06:30]  Anyway.  Yeah, sir.  Back to the point.  Before I was so rudely interrupted by.  Are the gentlemen on our left?  Exactly, Jimmy.  No, I'm kidding.  They go into these areas that are affected by natural disasters and human conflict and  they go in and they don't just provide the essential services like, you know, food, shelter  and medicine.  They actually stay there long term and help with long term economic recovery for these  communities, you know? 
[03:07:00]  And, you know, they just came up with this thing called the AgriFin Mobile where they,  through mobile technology, they're going to help low-income farmers in Zimbabwe, Uganda  and Indonesia to increase their produce and thereby their revenue by 30% within three months.  I mean, first three years, right?  Wow, I was going to say, wow, that's pretty fast.  First three years.  First three years.  So, they're very innovative and they're very smart and they go in and they just help these  people get back on their feet.  And most aid organizations go in and they do immediate recovery and then they head out. 
[03:07:30]  Right.  These guys stay there long term.  So, they're my real heroes, you know what I mean?  So, we're asking fans if they want to get involved and do something good, the first hundred  people who sign up to make monthly donations to Mercy Corps, they can go to www.mercycorps.org  forward slash princess bride and they will receive limited edition memorabilia like they can  get a piece of Rob Reiner's beard, you know, and they can get some funny posters that we 
[03:08:00]  made up that were not, you know, like I think they made up some funny posters like original  titles like, As You Wish Dude is one of them.  And then you can get like a, you can get an autographed copy of the screenplay by, autographed  by myself and Rob and Robin.  So, it's a good cause.  Yeah.  And then, you know, you can feel good about yourself and get some cool stuff at the same  time.  How much do you have to donate or is it not like a... 
[03:08:30]  It's five, ten.  It depends on how much you donate.  You go online, you can see what you can get, you know?  Would they sponsor something like Dorothy?  That'll take care of disasters before they happen!  And you guys have the same thing, only with the square things.  Right.  I know.  That's one job.  Right.  And that was so dumb.  They went through so many Dorothy's.  Why not fasten it down so it doesn't tip over?  It's a tornado.  Because the movie would be over in about five minutes.  I know.  I can't get past those little things, though. 
[03:09:00]  It's the MacGuffin.  It's the MacGuffin.  Yeah.  It was the thing they had to fix to make it happen and then save the day.  Don't they have planes that drive into storms?  Like, don't they have...  Drive into storms?  Don't they have planes that actually fly, like propeller planes that fly in and they...  Into hurricanes, not tornadoes.  Oh, right.  Okay.  Yeah, a tornado would be a little dangerous flying an aircraft into a tornado.  What do you think would have happened if you stayed there in your car?  Would you guys have gotten...  I mean, that's...  You would have gotten killed, but...  Oh, when you went to the real pretty prairie?  When you actually went, yeah. 
[03:09:30]  Well, I don't know if the car would have been lifted.  Maybe.  Probably.  I don't know.  It wasn't like an F5.  It was like an F1.  You know, F1.  But it was still pretty hairy.  The golf balls were scary.  The golf-sized hail.  They really looked like golf balls coming down.  I play with hail-sized golf balls when I golf, which is very, um...  Yeah.  Unfunny.  And then...  Fucking cool.  Ah, it's funny.  No, it was very intense.  I don't recommend it.  I don't recommend it.  Listen, only professionals should do that.  I should point that out on air.  You know what?  It probably helped you. 
[03:10:00]  Don't think that you can copy me and go, oh, Gary, I'll say we could go drive into  the storm.  Ha!  No.  Don't do it.  Kids.  Did you talk...  Don't try that at home.  Did you talk the lady into letting you go by saying it would help you with your character?  With my character, of course.  Yeah, what else am I going to say?  You know, I should...  Yeah.  I should see a real storm.  I should see a real storm.  Yeah.  You know.  Did it help you with the character, or was it just fun to watch?  It helped me soil my pants.  Yeah?  It didn't help with the character?  No.  Because the guy next to you was probably a mellow, regular guy, right?  No, it did help.  It helped.  It helped seeing one.  I mean, but I don't recommend... 
[03:10:30]  Like I said, I don't recommend actually driving to chase one.  You know, chasing storms.  Like I said, these guys do it for a living.  They do it year after year.  What do they do when they get there, though?  Like what are they trying...  Like what is the storm chaser trying to do?  What they're trying to do is track it, because tornadoes change on a dime.  They move directions on a dime.  It's very hard to sense where it's going to go.  And what they do is they track it so they can warn communities ahead of time, enough ahead  of time, to try and get people to safety. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah.  And they want to test it, and they want to find out what kind of storm it is, and what,  you know, and they go and they pick up the hail, and they go back and research that.  All kinds of stuff.  The extreme once was naked, right?  And he walked out of his door, and the twister's right there, and you know what he did?  What happened?  He threw a bottle of Jack Daniels at it, and the bottle just went right up into the tornado.  Did he really?  The extreme.  The extreme.  Yeah.  You know, the extreme.  Bill.  Yeah, the extreme.  What happened after he threw the bottle of Jack Daniels?  Ah, he cursed at the tornado. 
[03:11:30]  It was great.  Dusty thought it was the best thing ever.  Dusty had his nose.  You really know this movie, man.  I love Twister.  It's hysterical.  Hysterical.  Nothing but Twister.  He's thinking enough about Twister.  I know enough about the tornado.  We get it.  Idiot.  Were you scared when you saw Saw in the theater?  No, because I made it.  It's a scary film.  I kind of knew what was going to happen.  Yeah, that kind of sucks.  You missed out on the cool twist.  But it's cool. 
[03:12:00]  You know, I love the way it was made.  I thought it was really well directed and well made.  So creepy.  Every once in a while, a movie like that kind of changes the look of horror movies like that.  And then you have The Ring, which changed a lot of the camera work.  Now everyone kind of wants to do that stop motion.  Oh, I hate that.  It's so scary.  It was.  It's not anymore.  Now it's just kind of standard.  It says you.  You're used to it.  You can't see pornography with that now.  The money shot.  Fucking dancing around.  That's when you know a look is gone when it ends up in porno.  Remember the grunge with the soft focus background? 
[03:12:30]  They started doing that in like dog food commercials.  It was over.  Have you seen yourself?  Is there any character you've ever done in a movie that's been put into a porno?  Because they seem to parody.  Why do they parody everything?  Well, you would probably know that more than I.  I don't watch the movie parody ones because they're kind of silly.  I just watch the really, really hardcore ones.  All right.  We got a rap call.  Oh, man.  Sure.  We'll end on that note.  Thank you for that riveting question that was so intriguing and mind-blowing at the same 
[03:13:00]  time.  I was just curious because you've done a lot of roles and I figured one of them might have  been made into a porno movie.  Oh, geez.  Yeah, I really keep track of those things.  You know, I have someone who works for me 24-7 collating all of that.  Yes.  What did somebody tell you?  Like, if I did a role that got me and they parried it, I think it would be silly.  Like, Judith Freaklander.  Where did you find this guy?  Seriously.  Where did you find it?  Many years ago with Andrew Dice Clay. 
[03:13:30]  Oh.  Yeah.  That explains everything.  Sorry.  I didn't mean to ask a tasteless porn question.  I figured after Saw, he'd be kind of hard to shock.  You were also in an episode of Seinfeld.  No, I wasn't.  No, not you.  Geez, Jimmy.  Give him another sedative, please.  Please.  Okay.  Yes, I was in Seinfeld.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:14:00]  Which episode was that?  Um, I can't remember the name of the episode, but it was a lot of fun.  Those guys, hilarious.  Yeah.  Hilarious.  Michael Richards, especially.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  There we go.  That show still just holds up.  There we go.  Very funny.  No, very funny, guys.  I had a good time.  I had a really good time on that show.  I couldn't believe they wanted me to be on it.  I didn't know.  You know, they just called me up and said.  Really?  Yeah.  Let's see.  George makes a comment that breaks up a married couple.  Because of the comment, he tries to find a way out of his pending marriage to Susan. 
[03:14:30]  Oh, I guess you were.  In the big Susan episode?  The guy that was.  That's right.  Trying to get his gal, I think.  Yeah, yeah.  You were trying to get his girl.  Yeah.  Right, right.  You broke up a couple.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, that was.  They were all fucking funny.  I don't know what I was going to say.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, it was a funny one.  As opposed to all of them that were funny.  All right.  Carrie, thanks so much for coming in.  Thank you.  Princess Bride, 25th anniversary, and you can also, if you want to donate to the charity 
[03:15:00]  that Carrie's involved with, it's called Mercy Corps, and it's mercycorps.org slash Princess  Bride, and with each donation, I think if you're the first hundred, you can get memorabilia,  signed copies of the script, or a piece of Rob Reiner's beard hair, which is kind of  creepy like he's Muhammad, but it's still a good cause, so donate.  I didn't just say that.  Did he just say that?  Yeah, I know.  Well, yeah, beard.  Let's run out of the place.  Run.  Jesus, run.  Run.  Well, there is one of Muhammad's beard hairs on display. 
[03:15:30]  Oh, I don't know if I, ah, we're cutting now.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I saw that in Istanbul.  Yeah, yeah.  I saw.  I saw a piece of beard hair.  Yeah.  People lined up for hours to see this tiny little piece of beard hair.  Yeah, it's actually there.  Really?  It's an actual thing.  Yeah, seriously?  One strand of a beard hair.  That's fine to say.  Okay.  So you were panicking for no reason, and I was being very honest.  Oh, okay.  That's why I think Rob Reiner giving away a beard hair.  Oh, okay.  I thought you were going somewhere else with that, Jimmy.  Oh, my God.  No.  Not on this show.  No.  Well, actually on this show.  If you weren't here, we'd just lay into it. 
[03:16:00]  We don't care about our lives.  Exactly.  Or should we?  Or should we?  What are they going to do, murder us and disappoint 11 listeners?  Give us a shit.  We're done.  Yeah, we're done.  Thanks a lot.  Thanks, guys.  We're done for the day.  Thank you.  Very cool.  Thank you.  And we'll see you guys tomorrow.  Yes.  All right.  You've heard about it.  You've waited four long hours for it.  And now the moment you've waited for rears its ugly nose.  Head.  After Opie and Anthony Live is coming up next. 
[03:16:30]  Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After Opie and Anthony Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  I'm sure you all think that what?  What did you say?  Huh?  Huh? 
[03:17:00]  Who's Blu-ray that is?  I don't know.  Sal looks like an asshole today.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  I'm sure.  No, but you do.  You know that.  How do I look like an asshole?  Because I tucked in my shirt today?  Because you have your button down, and it's kind of unbuttoned with your v-neck, and it's  tucked in.  Yeah.  You're obviously going for something.  I'm not going for anything.  That's obvious to everybody.  And I'm sure what else was obvious to everybody was a bit of a rocky landing for that one. 
[03:17:30]  Got a little tense in here.  I think that translated over the air quite obviously.  A bit.  Now, I don't think the chemistry between Mr. Norton and Mr. Elwes was quite on par with  some of our other guests.  I will say this.  We landed smoothly.  Yes.  But it was almost a horrible flaming wreckage of a plane crash.  Oh, yeah.  Roland, you were listening.  You're the guest booker.  This is your whole thing.  My ass twitched.  You were scared.  When he said the worst I was scared was, where do you find this guy? 
[03:18:00]  I was like, oh.  And then when he said, he asked that somebody give Jim a sedative, as in put him down so  I don't have to deal with him.  Oh, I didn't hear that.  Oh, yeah.  He said, will somebody get this guy a sedative?  And I was like.  Well, what helps with Anthony's, the Fijia man.  The other thing was, this is what I learned on the show today, if you can get somebody  in here who was in Twister, Anthony is as happy as a pig in shit. 
[03:18:30]  Let me tell you.  There was no, I couldn't, I'm sure he would not do another interview that focuses like  that on Twister.  And he also couldn't tell if Ant liked it or not.  He was like, oh, thank you.  Thank you.  And Ant was like, yeah, I watch it because it's terrible.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  But if Philip Hoffman was here, he'll do the same thing for Twister.  That was, yeah.  Dusty.  That was interesting, though, because it seemed like, where did Jim and Carrie kind of fork  in that road?  They were on the same road at the beginning of the interview. 
[03:19:00]  Was it the porno question that they each took different paths?  I think it was the Saw question.  Like, oh, you're in the same set every day.  It was easy.  That kind of.  Oh, okay.  That sounded Carrie kind of like, now the jabby.  It wasn't a jab at him, but he felt it at the jab.  Maybe that he just didn't pick up on, you know.  And then we all made fun of Jim because the running joke is, you know, Jim thinking he's  more Hollywood than he is and Carrie just not.  And then when he goes, yeah, do you planes fly through tornadoes? 
[03:19:30]  Yeah.  So then they're joking.  Then he was like, eh.  Yeah.  Because then it went.  It went.  I think all of us in here were wondering how bad it was going to get.  866-WOW-1-WOW is our number.  866-969-1969.  Yeah, and it's been a long time.  It's been since Paris Hilton was in here that we had a really bad guest moment.  Eric, see if you can get a clip of Paris Hilton.  Yeah, it wasn't too bad they all held back.  The verbal one was Ventura.  Yeah, well, I mean, there's been more than Ventura because Jim, when he starts being challenged, 
[03:20:00]  he's not the guy to take it sitting down.  If for a second he thinks that somebody is pushing him, he pushes back much harder.  You had your Jesse Ventura, where we talked about it not too long ago because Ventura was in here,  where they got into such a big fight.  Jesse walked off.  He wanted to punch Jim in the face.  And for years, for years, he's never been back.  Ventura hasn't.  You had Chris Jericho who was in here.  And he didn't like that Jim made a paraplegic joke about Christopher Reeve, 
[03:20:30]  which there may be other people like that, but Jim took umbrage with that.  And things got a little tense, and it got bad.  That one was bad, too.  People forget because Jericho and Norton are friends again, but that one got really bad.  Paris Hilton, I mean, it was the whole room, but Jim was definitely very pissed off about that.  And I didn't expect it because Cary Elwes is kind of known as having a sense of humor. 
[03:21:00]  And so I thought this would be like a...  And it was a good interview, and it was cool in the end.  But for a few moments there, and I think you all sensed it with me,  we didn't know where this plane was going to land.  We were going...  We ended up...  We were through a tornado, man.  Fajia.  We ended up landing smooth right there next to the West Side Highway on the Hudson River.  It could have been the F5.  Sully Sullenberger landed this plane right.  But it could have...  Fuck Sally.  Yeah.  I was like... 
[03:21:30]  It could have easily been...  It could have easily been JFK Jr.  Let's be honest.  It could have easily been, I don't know if I'm upside down or right side up.  I don't know what's going on anymore.  I'm going to crash this thing into Long Island Sound.  It could have done either one of those two.  But the good news is we have one Blu-ray to give away.  Not autographed.  We have four autographed ones.  We have four signed Blu-rays to give away?  Yeah, and one none.  If you want to.  I mean, I do want to.  Let's see...  Depends how good they are. 
[03:22:00]  Daniel in Alabama.  Daniel, you're on after Opie and Anthony Live.  Kerry or Gary or what?  He's a fucking douchebag.  Fuck him.  He shouldn't talk to Jim.  They should do some goddamn research before they come on the television show.  I mean, before they come on the radio show.  They should know what kind of...  I mean, how in the fuck do they go in there?  They're not knowing anything about that.  Fucking Jesse Ventura is a douchebag, too.  And patting Jim on his fucking shoulder.  They know what they're walking into.  Why in the fuck...  Why don't their publicist let them do it if they know that's a possibility? 
[03:22:30]  Fuck him.  Jim, we love you, dude.  I hope you're listening.  On one end, yes.  The guests should all do thorough research before coming into this studio.  But I guess in defense of the guests, they could also request that Opie and Anthony and Jim do some research on them, too.  You know, who knows?  Stinky, what did you learn?  You know, I dropped my band off this morning going to Nashville.  I should be happy, but I'm very sad.  Mm-hmm.  Why is that?  I found out this morning one of my favorite radio personalities, Primetime Sam Roberts, will do anything to get a viral video, including lie about hiring actresses. 
[03:23:00]  I just don't know, man.  My confidence is shaking.  Sal's in here with his new pants and everything.  He's like he's a model getting pissed off at the intern.  Listen, Stinky.  She wasn't hired.  The video was real.  It's ridiculous.  And it was featured on one of those, is it real, is it not shows?  Anybody who does a show about viral videos wants so badly to have a viral video and just can't get the job done.  And we went there twice, and she was weird both times.  And, for the record, I interviewed Greg Packer, who we talked about. 
[03:23:30]  What happened with her after I interviewed Greg Packer?  Did I approach her, or did she say to me, hey, can I do an interview?  She wanted an interview.  Right.  And I go, okay, she's just sitting here in this desk chair.  I'll just talk to her.  Like, I talked to everybody else.  And then we went back again for the second time because of the audio problem.  She goes, I'll talk again.  Right.  She was there just staring out, doing nothing.  Sal, what are you getting so upset about over there?  He's just, you're taking the tear sheet.  Put that down.  What are you getting so upset about, Sal?  I've never disconnected the replay before. 
[03:24:00]  I don't know how it goes.  Oh.  It's just, I don't know how many weeks he's been here.  He's just still, like...  No one ever showed me that.  I'll get it.  Does Anthony know how to do it?  Nobody showed you how to do it?  Is that true?  The replay is not.  I will never forget now.  I'll do it.  How come nobody showed you how to do it?  No, he's definitely been shown, like, numerous times.  He's been shown.  That's not true.  Eric, was he shown?  He's been shown.  When I asked him why he didn't do it yesterday, he goes, oh, because Sam had a guest in there,  which is fine.  Which is fine.  I said, she's not, like, a major celebrity.  I didn't have a guest in here. 
[03:24:30]  I had Jenny Hut in here.  That's not a guest.  That's a charity.  Hang on.  He should take the precaution if you're doing an interview or something in here.  That's right.  But when I said, it doesn't matter that it's just her, you can go in there and do it.  He would just stand there and looking.  It's like, go in there and pull them apart.  Well, I know that he's doing phones right now, but does Anthony, the intern, know how  to disconnect the replay?  He does.  When did he learn?  First day, he's saying.  Was Julie here the first day with you?  The other intern, Julie.  Was Julie here the first day with you? 
[03:25:00]  Yes.  Did you both learn at the same time?  Did you both learn at the same time?  I believe so, yes.  That's not...  Then how did he learn how to do it?  The replays were usually disconnected and on the couch, so I usually just bring them  back into the...  But how did he learn how to...  Were you in the room and just not paying attention?  No.  I paid attention to everything we learned first day about breaking down the studio.  Then how did Anthony learn?  How did the other intern learn, but you didn't learn?  I don't think that Sal's learned how to disconnect the replay.  Then how does Anthony, the other intern, know how to do it? 
[03:25:30]  He probably learned it a different day and...  Do.  Anthony, what day...  He learned how to break down the studio the first day.  What day...  Ask the other intern, Anthony, Eric.  What day specifically did he learn how to disconnect the replay?  What day specifically did he learn?  I learned the first day.  He learned the first day, he says.  What day Sal taught us?  He said, the first day Sal taught you how to disconnect the replay.  Sal, did you or did you not teach intern Julie the first day how to disconnect the replay?  I think I showed both of them how to set up and break down the studio every day for the 
[03:26:00]  first two weeks.  That sounds like something you would do.  Right.  Is it possible that maybe you didn't write it down so you forgot?  No, because I would have remembered being shown even if I didn't remember how to do it.  I don't remember being shown.  I think he might have just disconnected it and...  But the...  I don't...  I honestly, like...  It doesn't work.  I would remember.  Because the other intern knows how to do it and you're both here the same days.  I don't...  Like, did they wait...  Just every day, too.  It's not like he missed out.  You don't believe that he knows how to do it?  He did have to leave one day for lunch.  All right, reset up the replays. 
[03:26:30]  You don't believe that Anthony knows how to do it?  No, I believe Anthony knows how to do it.  I don't think he wants to, you know, say that Sal didn't teach it to us.  When did he learn how to do it?  He could have learned anywhere between when we started and now.  So do you think that...  I don't think it was the first time.  Do you think that Eric and Sal feasibly waited until the day you weren't here so that way  they could teach the other intern how to disconnect the replays, which are...  The replays are the sound effect machines, you know, playing the laugh track and the...  And the Larry King saying, uh, end person and all those things. 
[03:27:00]  Um, that's...  The machines, they're hooked up.  They're hooked up with stereo cables.  So you think that what probably happened was that Sal and Eric, who are in charge of teaching the interns everything...  Sal is Eric's personal assistant.  What?  Executive assistant, I'm sorry.  Yeah, I was going to say, don't throw him into the bus.  You're right, you're right.  Um, that maybe the day waited until you were gone and then they taught the other intern how to do it  specifically because they knew the day would come that they could sabotage you and say, well, why don't you know how to do it? 
[03:27:30]  They would wait weeks because they knew this day, this moment is what the entire plan led to.  Do you think that's feasible?  Well, Eric wasn't here the first day, so it was just Sal.  Oh, boy.  So Sal...  He's not even answering the questions.  So Sal, well, no, Sal, I gotta talk to you about this because...  That is an answer to the question.  Because you are somebody who is conniving.  Yes.  And, uh, you plan far in advance. 
[03:28:00]  Your evil is far-reaching.  Sinister.  Sinister is a great word for Sal, and that's, and it's an alliteration.  Sinister Sal.  Tell me this, Sal.  Yes.  Did you wait until intern Julie was not here, teach the other intern how to disconnect the replays,  instruct that intern, whatever you do when asked, say that you were taught the first day with the other intern,  both of you were taught at the same time, even though you both knew it wasn't true, 
[03:28:30]  but you instructed him to lie under any circumstance, always lie,  then not teach Julie when he got back for the direct purpose of the unveiling of this master plan here on After Opie and Anthony Live.  Is that what happened?  That's why they call me Sinister Sal.  That was the whole plan from the beginning.  That's the whole plan from the beginning.  I have a lot of trouble believing that.  Yeah, I do too, because, like I said.  Because it's not true, is it?  It's not true at all.  No, no.  Because I, again, this is, Julie has an issue with everything that I tell him to do. 
[03:29:00]  That's not true.  Okay, you just, you just presented that you had, you, you, it struck issue with you that Sal said that you take issue that he's, that you, with everything he says.  He's making me dizzy.  Right.  Like, it's just.  Like, he literally just took issue with your statement.  He takes issue with everything I say.  It's, yeah.  I understand.  It's just fatiguing.  I showed them exactly how to set up the studio and break down the studio for the first two weeks.  Hopefully, that on the third week, it wouldn't be an issue. 
[03:29:30]  Like, it's kind of understood.  It's not that hard.  It just needs to be done a very particular way.  Eric, you're the intern boss.  Are you still instructing the interns to write things down?  Um, because generally speaking, right, like, it's like, uh, for instance, biology.  Uh-huh.  When a professor speaks on biology, it's not expected that all the students, uh, just take in that information audibly.  What?  Sorry.  Roland, are you imitating the intern?  It's not expected.  Eric has a lunch you go to. 
[03:30:00]  Can you wrap this up?  It's, I will get to that.  It's not expected that the interns take all this, or the students take all this information in audibly.  They're actually allowed to take notes while the professor speaks.  Then they can reflect on those notes and better learn the subject.  Eric, are they still told to write down, for that purpose, to write down the information that they're taught?  Yes, they're always to have a pad and a pen on them for anything that might, uh, that might, uh, happen out of nowhere. 
[03:30:30]  To write it down if they have to run and get something.  They're instructed to record something, so they, they write it down so that nothing gets fucked up.  Have you been, did, did you write things down from the beginning?  Yes, and I did.  I wrote down all the instructions on how to set up the studio, which papers.  And what did you write down for the, for the replays?  I didn't write anything down.  Do you have your notebook here?  Because I wasn't shown how to disconnect the replays.  Do you have your notebook?  It's in the, um, it's in the producer's studio.  Okay, hold on.  Just, just, just so everyone knows what it means in terms of disconnecting the replay.  Right.  There's an on-off switch, you put it on the off position, and then there's two XLR cables, you take those out. 
[03:31:00]  Yeah, I would have, wait a minute, one of the interns, one of the interns at the beginning of the semester, I don't remember if it was on the air or off the air, but one of them said to me, I don't have to connect it, right?  Just disconnect it, meaning this will be easier.  Right.  That could have been very well been Julie.  But I can't confirm that.  Yeah, it, Mars does set up, set them up in the morning.  No, okay, well, first of all, what happened was I didn't have trouble disconnecting it anyway. 
[03:31:30]  I probably would have been able to figure that out in a second.  What happened was I took the, um, the labels off Obie's.  Can you go grab your notebook?  Yeah.  Just run back real quick.  If you take time, by the way, don't open that notebook.  Do not start editing and, just run.  Run.  And go get it, and come right back here.  I'm gonna be watching him, because you know that son of a bitch.  He is, fuck, he is.  You definitely taught him how to do it.  We were here when you taught him.  Sam, remember how I said, I'm gonna say this before he gets down the hall.  Remember how much I hated Matt?  I like Matt more than this guy. 
[03:32:00]  Oh, God.  Is it because it's difficult to teach him?  I have to say, though, Drunk Sal is fun.  Oh, my God.  Well, I want to.  There's nothing to do with it.  Yeah, that has nothing to do.  I had nothing to do with it, though, but I don't care.  Is Mike and Piff involved, too?  Drunk Roland is a lot of fun.  Yeah, but Drunk Roland can't really handle his stuff the way he used to be able to.  I'm tired.  Okay, he's running back.  Okay, okay.  He's doing as assigned.  But the other thing is, Anthony knows how to do it.  The other intern.  Right.  He knows completely how to do it.  So it would make sense.  Do you mind if I look at it?  Hold on.  She's setting. 
[03:32:30]  Can you clean up the replay, though?  Because she's trying to set hers up.  Do you?  Wait, just give me your notebook.  Do you mind if I look through it?  I don't want to, you know.  No, I don't want you to look through it.  He might find a.  Just bring it to whatever the O&A stuff is.  I don't want you to.  Yeah, you're an A, Eric.  What?  Okay.  Okay.  Yeah.  Okay, this is chicken scratch, first of all.  It says.  What I'm saying, should I say?  Let's see.  Cup of ice for Anthony.  Okay, now you're taking the Fez replay.  Remember how it says Fez on that? 
[03:33:00]  You're right.  Do you work for it?  Okay.  This is the Ron and Fez intern.  Get the tear sheets on top of the CD players.  I was there with Anthony the other day.  She knows how to do it.  You weren't shown what?  How to touch the Ron and Fez replays?  Because we never instructed you to do that.  All right, here's the problem.  There's nothing.  He wrote nothing down about tearing apart the studio.  All he wrote was the things that are in the studio.  Because everything else is self-explanatory.  Like, I learned it once and I don't need to.  You didn't learn it, though. 
[03:33:30]  I learned...  Because there's nothing.  All it says is Opie, all papers, two waters, Sharpie pen.  Anthony posted it.  Who taught her how to do all that?  She's pretty...  Well, I mean, she obviously doesn't have an issue.  That wasn't the problem.  Sal stopped me as soon as I took the labels off of Opie's replay.  Because you were going to mix the labels up and I knew you weren't going to do all that.  But you understand...  If I put Opie's on the top of that stack, it wouldn't have been a problem.  Hang on, hang on, hang on.  You understand that there's nothing on this page about tearing down the studio.  There...  No, it's about setting up the...  Because everything else is...  Like, what would I write down?  I know how to switch out the headphones.  I know how to throw everything out. 
[03:34:00]  No, you forgot to do that, too.  It took you two weeks to learn how to switch out the headphones.  Yeah, well, I mean, the point was to make it habit so that I knew it.  I wouldn't have to keep looking at a paper.  I need you to write down...  And you see her on the paper?  Yeah, why is he crumpling up the paper?  He memorized it.  Do you think...  Oh, wait, oh, wait.  That's right.  He doesn't need that.  That's setting up the studio.  He usually gets here too late after 5.30.  That's bullshit.  I've been the first one here most of the time.  Oh, okay.  When you got here at a quarter to six today.  Yeah, because I was coming from Westchester last week.  And when you get here at seven and when you call out sick after the show started. 
[03:34:30]  Eric, is there a problem with him arriving on time or not a problem?  There was.  It seems to have been straightened out.  Except for today, though.  Okay, but how many times have I been the first one here?  Ask Anthony or Eric or anybody.  Like, for weeks.  Two weeks.  90% of the time I see Anthony and you're not here.  You come in and you sigh very loudly.  If Eric says it's not a problem, it's not a problem.  Right, Eric?  As of recent, it's not a problem.  Okay.  Eric, you talked to him.  You said it's a problem.  It was.  I've talked to him.  He solved the problem.  As he should have. 
[03:35:00]  Or maybe.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  You're working on solving the problem.  Yeah.  I mean, the problem was I was in Westchester for a week.  As you know, the first train is 5.09 a.m.  So let's get here.  It's okay to say.  Somebody has been coming here from Westchester for seven years.  Can you give him a right?  Saying as you know is terrible.  I mean.  Let's give him a right.  I got you.  You guys are close together.  What part of Westchester?  Last one.  See, you could totally other side of Westchester.  I'm not going to be able to.  That's where you live.  No, Roland, you have no idea where I live.  You've taken the wrong train more times than you've taken the right train to my house. 
[03:35:30]  That's your justice.  Save me.  Do you think that maybe you were shown how to do it and you forgot?  You didn't write it down.  And you said you did, but you didn't write it down.  I think that's fair.  Do you think there's a strong possibility, I believe.  You didn't write it down.  Because you didn't write down about switching out the headphones.  The thing is, I would have written it down if I had been shown.  But you didn't write down anything about tearing down the studio.  Because everything else was memorable.  So you're picking and choosing what's important and what isn't.  No, you're picking and choosing what I can memorize and what I can't. 
[03:36:00]  No, because we told you to write down everything that we need you to do.  By your defense, it would say that you were never taught how to switch out the headphones.  But you just said you were.  That's not true.  Look, I one time had a problem switching out the headphones.  But were you taught to switch out the headphones?  Yes.  How about the other day?  Hang on.  But you didn't write it down?  No.  So, there's a strong possibility, because it happens at the same time that the sound effect machine gets disconnected.  The same time.  But I did remember being shown how to switch out the headphones. 
[03:36:30]  Tell me this.  Are the sound machines disconnected at the same time as the headphones are replaced?  Does that happen at the same time?  Yes.  Were you taught how to switch out the headphones?  Yes.  Did you write that down?  No.  Then, odds are, at the same time that you were taught how to switch out the headphones, since it is part of the same process, you were probably taught how to switch out the replay machine, the sound effect machine.  Sal.  Yes.  You would have probably, you're the one who taught the interns how to tear down the studio. 
[03:37:00]  Absolutely.  Would you have shown them a piece of the process or the whole process?  Of course I'm going to say yes, because I don't, when I first met you, I was showing you everything precisely how it needs to be done.  I'm not going to show you the incorrect way to do something.  Anthony knows how to do it.  Did you show him the whole process at once?  It's possible.  Front to back.  Absolutely.  At the same time.  The same day.  You should, this is how you disconnect the headphones.  This is how you disconnect the sound machine.  Absolutely.  This is how, okay.  Absolutely.  For two weeks. 
[03:37:30]  I would think that that's probably true because he showed you how to set up the studio fully at one time because you wrote everything down.  So why would he show you everything except disconnecting the sound machines?  Where's the other intern?  He's on the phone.  It's in here.  Okay.  Yeah.  Put him near your mic just so I could talk to him for a second.  I mean, the only thing I could think of is I was not in the studio when Sal showed Anthony.  No.  You were both here.  There's no way I watched you teach me that and don't have any memory of it.  Anthony, you're the other intern who knows how to disconnect the sound machines. 
[03:38:00]  I do know how to disconnect the sound machines.  Correct.  You said you were taught the first day.  We were.  We were taught the first day.  A we.  Okay.  That's a specific pronoun to use.  We were both here, so we were both taught on the same day.  You were both present.  Physically.  Yeah.  Mentally, it's a mystery.  Absolutely.  But were you taught how to switch out the headphones and how to disconnect the sound machine at the same time?  Yes, because I even remember him saying specifically about powering down and then taking out the plug. 
[03:38:30]  I even remember that specifically from about a month ago.  Was that your first day memory?  There were a lot of first day memories.  Was that one of the memories of your very first day?  Yeah, that was.  Absolutely.  It's in my diary.  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you, Anthony.  It's in his diary, Julie.  Eric, would you have instructed Sal to – there's a lot of red tape that goes on behind the scenes here at the Opie and Anthony show.  Would you, Eric Nagel, have instructed Sal to show the interns how to disconnect the entire studio piece by piece over a series of days? 
[03:39:00]  Or would you have told Sal to show them the entire process start to finish at once?  I would have told Sal, which I did tell Sal, to show them how to do everything the same way every day for the next couple weeks so that it's ingrained in them so that it becomes, you know, old hats that they know what to do, when to do it.  Right.  Sal.  Yes.  As Eric's executive assistant, did you show both of our interns how to tear down the entire studio, meaning throw out the papers, which Julie knows how to do, replace the headphones, which Julie knows how to do, and on occasion – it took them a little while, but there's a learning curve for everybody – and disconnect the sound machines. 
[03:39:30]  The whole process, was that shown as Eric Nagel told you to, as intern Anthony said you did?  Did you do the whole process in one day? 
[03:40:00]  To start with?  Every day for the first two weeks of their internship, yes.  But the very first day of their internship, did you show them the whole process?  Yes, the very first day, yes, I did.  Okay, let me first say that, like, the issue wasn't I had trouble disconnecting the sound machines.  The issue was I touched Opie's labels and then Sal ran over and stopped me.  Part of the process.  But you just said a minute ago you didn't know how to disconnect the sound machines.  But I mean, it's fairly straightforward.  So he's doing things without knowing them.  No, it's obviously – it's fairly straightforward.  You, Roland, I was going to go to you next because you are somebody who – you have an analytical mind. 
[03:40:30]  Yes.  You assess situations.  That's what the White House calls me.  Isn't it true that in high school you were a mediator?  I was.  You were a peer mediator.  And when kids would get into fights, instead of getting into – instead of it resorting down to a physical fight in the playground,  the principal would say, I need you both to go see Roland.  As they called you in high school –  They called me the peacemaker.  They called you the road dog.  Yeah.  And they had to go see road dog, and road dog would kind of make everything okay.  Did that happen? 
[03:41:00]  Yes.  Then I have to ask you.  You've heard – the first intern, Anthony, we'll call him for the sake of – so listeners don't get confused.  We'll call him – and I hope you want to take offense to this, Julie – the good one.  So we'll call Anthony the good one.  You heard from the good one, the good intern, Eric Nagel, Sal, the shitty one, meaning employees.  He's not an intern anymore.  Eric's executive assistant.  And the not quite as good one, Julie, intern. 
[03:41:30]  You tell me, Roland.  We have four men – three men saying one thing, and one man saying something else.  What side of this do you fall on?  Where is the truth?  I think Julie intended to write it down, but then he just didn't give a shit.  He didn't?  Okay.  Okay.  So you're thinking that the problem is not that he wasn't taught –  He went YOLO.  Whatever.  He went YOLO.  Whatever, man.  He went sort of like this.  Yes, Sal, you can go ahead and teach me whatever you want, but I don't give a shit.  Sal's defense, he is very anal, and he goes over everything meticulously over and over again. 
[03:42:00]  There's nothing wrong with that.  No, that's what I mean.  So I have to side on Sal's side.  Wow.  Roland.  I have to because Sal's very – he makes sure everything is done.  I'm sure Julie intended to learn, but he forgot.  Luke on Instant Feedback, who calls into the show a lot, wants to know, Sal, do you keep a work log?  I do now.  Do you keep a work log of what you teach the interns on a day-to-day basis? 
[03:42:30]  No.  You know you're going to have to starting now.  Yeah.  Because obviously it is up in the air.  I haven't taught them enough.  Because I'll tell you this.  If Julie just forgot or didn't know how to disconnect the replays because he just doesn't know, then that's bad on him.  But if he was never taught and were this far into the internship, that would be gross incompetence on your part.  No, absolutely.  Okay.  I completely agree with that statement.  Although I showed him for two fucking weeks. 
[03:43:00]  For two fucking weeks.  That's not true.  No, that is absolutely true.  And also, okay.  How many times over two weeks did he show you then?  If not ten times?  How to disconnect the replays?  Yes.  How to set up and break down the studio?  He may have done it while I was in the room.  He never said, this is how you disconnect the replays.  But that's, I mean, and also, there's no issue of me.  Are you forgetting that Sam's hosting a radio show when I'm trying to break?  Oh, don't shush me.  He's telling me to shush.  Shut up.  He did shush.  Shush.  Go ahead.  Talk.  I'll let you talk.  No, because he's good.  Everybody needs a turn.  Julie, you need a turn.  Yeah, go ahead.  Take your turn.  All right.  Shush. 
[03:43:30]  I didn't run into a problem disconnecting the replays.  What happened was I was going to disconnect them, which, I mean, it's obvious.  There's cables.  You unplug them.  You turn them off first so you don't unplug something that's on and, you know, carry them  over.  All I did was I attempted to take Opie's labels off, and that's when Sal stopped me from doing  it.  Because you didn't know what you were doing.  No, I was, yeah, but taking the label off, I mean, I was going to put it in that stack.  He could have told me after I had disconnected them.  But you didn't know what you were doing because that's the issue. 
[03:44:00]  Oh, and not to forget, he picked up Fez's replay right after that.  You did try to take Fez's replay from Ron and Fez's lovely intern, who's just trying  to do her job.  She's got enough on her plate without our interns trying to steal her equipment.  And she learned the first day, too.  She's got to be responsible for this stuff, and you're sitting there trying to, what,  set up a garage sale with Ron and Fez's equipment?  There was a lot of mental pressure when I did that.  That was stupid of me.  There was.  I understand.  I understand.  Now, but the problem is that he was telling you, he was scolding you for Opie's replay 
[03:44:30]  templates, the labels, as you call them, because you didn't know what you were doing.  And the issue is now, you not knowing what you're doing.  Now I do.  Like, and I'll never repeat that.  Yeah, but.  But your internship's like halfway over.  So.  That's not true.  It's one quarter.  Unfortunately it's not.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, unfortunately it's not.  It's been a long one with these guys.  He just keeps on telling me to shut up.  Well, he doesn't like you.  Because if you, like, I don't know, whatever.  You just want to be a fucking authority figure so badly.  Yeah, that's exactly what I want. 
[03:45:00]  What I want to do is I want to instruct you to do the right thing so I don't have to deal  with shit like this.  And you're not keeping a work log, which a good authority figure would probably have  kept able to.  And you're loving this right now because it makes you look good.  How does this make me look good?  It makes you look competent.  Well, let me find out from Izzo who it makes look good.  Izzo, you're on after Opie and Anthony Live.  Hey, what's up, Sam?  How you doing, buddy?  Now, I have a question for Sal.  Like, I know he gets mad or all this other stuff, but was he in charge of weird medicine  this weekend?  Were you in charge of weird medicine this weekend, Sam? 
[03:45:30]  Um, no.  No, why?  Oh, because the same episode replayed again for the fourth time.  No, that's not true.  I think it was a real one this week.  He was off this past weekend.  Oh, Mr. Complainer.  Mr. Dr. Steve complaining about people replaying his show is having a nice vacation for himself,  huh?  He's back this weekend.  Yeah, I'll bet he is.  I really love the people on Twitter.  Not if Sal's in charge.  People on Twitter.  Not if Sal's in charge.  He's not.  Did you know that, Julie, that Sal played the same Dr. Steve show three weeks in a row? 
[03:46:00]  Yeah.  Costing Dr. Steve both listeners, exposure, and money.  That's not both.  That's three things.  See, I've never cost anyone any of those things.  You haven't?  No.  Good for you.  Just pain and suffering right now, yeah.  Good for you.  Jeez.  Good for you, Julie.  Good for you.  He hasn't.  I still like Julie, though.  You do?  Yeah.  Thank you.  Is he your favorite intern?  Yes.  Yes.  There's only two, so.  Actually, Anthony is.  That's the other one, so.  Yeah, my dog, Anthony.  But that's not to say something negative about it. 
[03:46:30]  I mean, people can like both.  They just like one slightly more.  It's because he's around more.  He's around more.  That's all it is.  I wish I was wrong.  His favorite intern.  You do?  Yeah.  You are my favorite intern.  Thank you.  What about Anthony?  Don't kill me.  Yeah.  You're worried about that.  Nah.  Well, Sal, how do you move forward?  Because you have to realize that as the authority figure that you so desperately want to be.  Yes.  You have to realize that part of your, right?  Part of your job is now working with Julie. 
[03:47:00]  And he is sitting there saying, Sal doesn't respect me.  Sal is not nice to me.  Sal's a real POS part of my language.  Sal will, I mean, look, like, and look, like, I'm not going to do this, like, just  to be like, fuck Sal.  Like, he, I mean, he definitely knows what he's doing most of the time.  It's just like, sometimes he'll act like.  Where's everybody going?  Sal, where are you going?  I was having him shut the door.  It wasn't closing.  Oh.  Ah, leave it open.  You know, let the ambiance take over. 
[03:47:30]  Yeah.  Well, all right, look, there was one time where I got Anthony's ice fine, like, perfectly,  right?  You did that once?  No, I do it every day, actually.  Oh, okay.  But, no, I handed it to Sal, and he opened the cap and looked at it, and then ran back  upstairs as if I had done something wrong.  What did he do wrong with the ice that day?  I'll tell you exactly what happened that day.  Please do.  Anthony likes his ice a very particular way.  What way is that?  Because Anthony loves a cool beverage.  I'll tell you how Anthony likes his ice.  No, no, you shouldn't, because you fucked it up twice.  No, let me see if I get it right.  No, shut up.  Let me see if I get it right.  He keeps on telling me to shut up. 
[03:48:00]  Dude, if you weren't an intern, there would be a real fucking issue right now.  What would it be?  He keeps on telling me to shut up.  Like, I don't know who you think you are.  Roland, what are you jumping up and down about?  Let me tell you how, we'll get back to the story in a second, Sam.  I'm trying to figure out what Roland's got.  He's like a kid in a candy store right now.  It's like a big battle mug.  It's awesome.  What is it from?  From Brad Thor.  From Brad Thor?  Yeah.  Whatever.  Okay, so.  And if you don't like what Sal is saying, just tell me to shut the fuck up. 
[03:48:30]  It's okay.  Anyway, Sal, go ahead.  Anthony likes his ice a very particular way.  Shut the fuck up, Sal.  I'm just kidding.  I'm just kidding.  I'm just kidding.  I'm just kidding.  Why are you going to step out of the room?  You have to.  This is Sal time out right now.  What is he stepping out of the room for?  All right, I'll fall in for Sal.  When Sal gets angry, Sal has to give himself a time out.  Wait a minute.  I'm just being a dick.  Wait a minute.  Like Tim.  You're allowed to.  He can't, like, I don't know.  Tim and Tulsa.  See, this is going to.  Tim and Tulsa has.  He's got some advice for you, Julie.  All right.  Tim.  I had a comment for Julie? 
[03:49:00]  Yeah.  Julie.  Don't make Sal angry.  Don't get the panda angry.  I think it's too late.  Do you think Sal's out there roaring like a lion right now?  What's he doing stepping outside, Eric?  A salamander.  That's not professional.  Anything but a panda.  That's not.  Tell Sal that's not professional.  Tell Sal to get his ass back in here.  Tell him to get his hipster, belted, tucked in shirt, v-neck t-shirt, glasses-weared ass 
[03:49:30]  back in here.  He threw the headphones pretty hard, too.  They might be broken.  That's also company profit.  If he damages equipment, that's not good, Julie, is it?  Nah.  Somebody should have taught him the proper way to take those headphones off, don't you think?  I think he was taught.  He just choose not to remember.  Choosed or chose?  Chosed.  Chosed?  Chosen.  There's lots of words that you don't know, Eric.  I'm learning.  You doing okay now, Sal?  I'm doing much better.  I counted to ten.  Did you growl like a lion?  I did.  Play the thing, Eric.  Play it for Sal so he knows. 
[03:50:00]  Don't get the panda angry!  Right.  Was that you outside?  That was you?  Yeah, that was me.  Growling?  Yeah.  Alright, so now you got that growl out of your system.  I did.  You can put your panda claws away.  And, uh, why did you step out of the room like that?  No, because I...  You got upset when he said, shut the fuck up?  It's just, I don't even know why I'm even talking to him.  Shut the fuck up.  You're like one of those...  Alright, I...  Yeah, you're just kidding.  That's the last one.  You're fucking nothing.  You're like one of those rappers.  What the fuck?  What does that mean?  Why? 
[03:50:30]  Because I'm not hired here?  I'm nothing?  Sounds like one of those...  Yeah, pretty much.  Sounds like one of those rappers that we were talking about on the show today who is just like,  What you mean?  Hey, you ain't gonna respect me.  Like, he doesn't really do much to earn the respect, but he's just like, I require respect.  Well, everyone should require respect.  No, you gotta earn it.  Yeah, but you should still require it to some degree.  No, no, no, no, no.  You know what happens with me?  I very rarely get respect, but the small amount of respect that I do, how did I get it, Julie? 
[03:51:00]  You're just...  You earn it.  That's right.  And I do respect you.  Thank you very much, Julie.  Thank you for saying that.  He's a good guy.  He's a good actor.  Yeah, you are.  He knows.  He knows.  So, what's the issue, Sam?  What's the issue?  We were just talking about Anthony's ice.  Yeah.  Julie politely requested...  Yeah, tell me what was wrong with the ice that day.  That you shut the fuck up and you left the studio.  So, how does Anthony like his ice for his V8 beverages in the morning?  You need to fill the cup up all the way to the top. 
[03:51:30]  To the tippy top, you say?  Not beneath the tippy top.  To the tippy-tippy top.  And then you put a lid on it.  It needs to be a large cup.  Which I did, and I always do.  And I've never gotten it wrong.  Never.  The issue is, the reason why I went and got it myself that day...  Yes, please.  ...was because prior, the day before Anthony said...  Richard Pryor.  The day before Anthony said on air,  What the fuck is with this?  Why isn't there any ice in this cup?  And I thought to myself, hmm...  Who had gotten the ice that day?  Julie did.  And I was like, hmm...  Is that true?  Why isn't that...  No, I've always...  Are you just going to talk over me every two seconds? 
[03:52:00]  He just asked me a question.  I did ask him a question.  Okay, well let me finish first.  Sure.  Sure.  I wouldn't want to disrespect you.  Oh my...  It's grating, isn't it?  It's just amazing.  So what happened?  So I'll follow up with you, Julie.  I realized, hmm, I didn't check the ice before, you know, bringing it in.  Right.  So, when he brought to me the ice that day, I said, this isn't good.  So I said, fill it all the way to the top.  Yeah.  And do it again.  Right.  Like I showed you the two weeks when you first started here how to get the ice. 
[03:52:30]  Like when you're claiming that you showed him the sound effect machine.  Exactly.  Right.  Right.  This is all hypothetical, let's say.  And...  So he went and got it again.  And I looked at it again.  It was wrong.  So I just threw it out.  That's bullshit.  And this is, this is, Anthony's now in the studio.  Now, what's wrong with it?  How much ice is in these cups?  There's probably your minus, let's say, 20...  There's barely any room for your drink in this cup.  No, no, no.  I mean the cups that were handed to Sal by Julie.  He's probably minus, minus 20 cubes, let's say.  Wow.  But now, these aren't full-size cubes, by the way.  For those of you that don't know, here at SiriusXM, they use a smaller cube of ice than 
[03:53:00]  you might be used to.  It's almost a, it's not even a cube because it's not equal on all sides.  Hotel-size chips.  It's like a chip, it's a sliver of a cube.  It's like taking a cube and slicing it.  Right.  Now that everybody's on the same page, as far as the ice is concerned, go on, Sal.  And the system that I like to have is when you see Anthony coming down the hall, that's  when you go get the ice.  And that's what I do, and that's where I've always thought.  Stop, are you going to let me finish?  You see, Anthony, you get it?  It's bullshit that I'm talking.  No, it's bullshit because I've, you showed me the first day, you did show me. 
[03:53:30]  When Anthony arrives here.  And I've done it when he arrives for the show.  When he arrives here, we like to get in the ice as soon as possible.  We don't like to have ice waiting, we get them fresh ice, right?  Because otherwise, what do you get?  You get a cup of water with ice.  Exactly.  To melt it.  Exactly.  So now Julie's gone through two revisions of getting ice.  Because he was about-  So now Anthony's waiting.  Because he was about 20 chips shy.  Exactly.  Of a cup.  Exactly.  And I don't like to have Anthony wait.  I want Anthony to have that ice as soon as he gets here.  And you don't like to have Anthony wait because he doesn't like to wait.  And he shouldn't have to.  That's right. 
[03:54:00]  So I said-  That's his name right there.  Exactly.  So I said, fuck this.  I'm going to run upstairs, get the ice myself, get it the way I know Anthony likes it.  Yeah.  And run it down and bring it in to Anthony.  Ice diva!  Well, he's not a diva.  It's the way he wants it.  It's the way you should fucking get it.  You know who can get the ice every day without being checked is the other intern, Anthony.  No, I-  Well, first of all-  Anthony's perfected the ice.  I've never had a problem with the ice.  Well, it sounds like you have had a problem.  Sal-  No, Sal found a fucking problem, of course.  But there was nothing wrong with it.  I always-  Since the first day when he showed me, I've always filled Anthony's ice up to the top. 
[03:54:30]  I've waited until I see him walking down the hallway to go get it.  And he always has it right on.  Ah, you know what?  What?  You know what?  I'm trying to think of-  I think I may have made a mistake, actually.  Oh!  I definitely made a mistake.  The deck of cards is tumbling down, Julie.  You know what?  Okay, the first week of his internship, that Friday, he came in late.  So that would be- that would knock us down to nine days of not showing how to set up the studio.  And then that first Monday, he called out after the show started. 
[03:55:00]  So that would knock it down to eight without showing him the setup and the breakdown.  So, you know, it wasn't for two weeks.  Uh, let's see, Sal.  What you just did was-  That's catty.  You just brought up his shortcomings of days that he wasn't here months ago.  I was revising a statement that I made.  You saw what he did there, right, Julie?  Yes, this is how he is.  He's passive-aggressive.  You know, I am listening to this whole thing.  And I'm starting to think that maybe this has a little more-  It's not just about ice chips and replay machines. 
[03:55:30]  Am I picking that up right, Julie?  I- look, I mean, I- yeah, I mean, I feel like Sal's always had this air of, like, passive aggression that I can't-  You know, I can't put it into words, but-  Do you think- what school do you go to?  NYU.  What school did you go to?  I went to SUNY Purchase.  Oof.  Oof.  Do you think that there's a bit of jealousy on Sal's part that maybe he is trying to make sure that you stay down?  Because let's be honest.  What, a semester ago, Sal was an intern himself. 
[03:56:00]  Do you think that maybe he sees you, and he likes the idea, maybe, of making somebody look bad to try to make himself look better?  Is he threatened by you, is what I'm asking.  I mean, without being arrogant, uh, maybe.  You think so?  What do you- what do you propose to the show?  Yeah, of course he's gonna say, what do you-  What do you give to the show?  What is it that you do that I would be remotely-  We gotta-  I don't know.  We have to go-  So then don't say nothing like that.  We have to go to an intellectual mind for this.  Uh, Robert Kelly is on the phone. 
[03:56:30]  Comedian Bob Kelly.  What's up, Bobby?  Sam Bones, what's up?  Are you- have you been listening?  I've been listening, and I just wanna let you know,  that Anthony is the best fuckin' intern there.  He is.  Why do you say that?  Cause he met him.  He went to my show on Saturday night.  Oh, he went the extra mile, is what you're saying.  He thought outside of the box and said,  what do I do to increase my connections to network here with this opportunity?  And you know what?  I got him tickets, right? 
[03:57:00]  For free.  He didn't have to pay.  Wow, that was nice of you.  But he- he made the effort, so I got him tickets, and he brought all his-  You know, his, um, you know, gay friends.  He's got a lot of gay friends?  He has some gay friends.  Well, they look-  They- I don't know if they are gay, but they definitely are, um-  They came across that way.  What's that word I'm looking for?  Um, queer looking.  Okay, I'm glad that you figured that out. 
[03:57:30]  But Anthony not only has those pillow lists, and those- those, uh, those Superman glasses.  Right.  He's a good guy.  He's a good guy.  Unlike these other guys who just show up and do their job and leave.  Right, cause he goes the extra mile.  He went to go to learn the clientele.  Did he behave himself at your show?  Oh my god, it was unbelievable.  I ripped him a new asshole.  I- I fucked with him and his stupid friends.  And he was cool with it.  I told him I wish they died.  And he-  Yeah, they were cool. 
[03:58:00]  See?  Yeah.  I go to the Comedy Cellular all the time.  I'll- I'm- I would love to come to one of your shows.  The bad intern wants to go to one of your shows.  I love you as a stand-up.  I- I really like him.  And as-  I do.  A little more than a stand-up?  Um.  Do you love him, like, more than a stand-up?  Well, we've never met him in person.  But?  But it- I mean, I wouldn't-  You have feelings.  He made Bob hang up.  Oh, Bob hung up on you.  He's not- I don't think he's gonna give you any tickets.  Alright, well-  You could buy some.  Sure.  I- I would.  So you think- I mean, so that kind of confirms that right now, uh, the other intern, Anthony, 
[03:58:30]  is the reigning superior intern.  Sure.  And, like, I have no problem.  But the question remains, do you think Sal is threatened by you?  Like, Sal's always been, like-  A bit threatened.  He's- he's had an aggressive energy towards me that he didn't have towards Anthony.  Wow.  I don't know what that's about.  What school does Anthony go to, Eric?  I'm sorry?  What?  What school does Anthony go to?  What school do you go to, Anthony?  Wagner.  Wagner.  Anthony's my paisan, too. 
[03:59:00]  I mean, he's Italian.  We're both from South Island.  Yeah, I'm Italian, too.  What does that have to do with me?  You both went to schools that weren't quite NYU.  I'm sensing some- a little bit of jealousy here.  Do you think that you're smarter than Sal?  Don't- Sal, I don't want to hear from you.  I want to hear from Julie right now.  Do you think that as just a human being, intelligence-wise, do you think you're a little smarter than Sal?  I mean, I- I mean, I'm definitely, like, as smart as him.  Yeah, but- and if you had to pick, if you- if you- if you had a gun to your head, would you say you're smarter than Sal? 
[03:59:30]  Sure.  Yeah.  You think so?  Yes.  That's kind of the vibe you get.  Better problem solver?  I mean, he's not stupid.  He's just, like, he, you know, he's a dick for, you know, for no reason, and he, you know-  He's not stupid, but he's not you.  Yes.  No, he's not.  Right.  Okay.  Sal, is that the issue here?  Are you intimidated by Julian's intellect?  I really am.  I think he's gonna get the job over me.  I'm just gonna get fired tomorrow, probably.  I would recommend it.  I would- I would.  Yeah, I would recommend that. 
[04:00:00]  By the way, um, Mars' theory was that, yes, Sal is threatened by me.  Mars believes that Sal is threatened by you?  Yes.  That's what he told you?  Yes.  Mars, our engineer?  Yes.  The one who wears terrible MMA shirts?  I like his shirts.  You do?  Well, you guys are buddies.  Yeah.  So you don't want to insult his shirts?  No.  But he thinks that Sal is intimidated by you?  Uh, yeah, that was, I mean, that was a theory he had.  And you agree?  Well, I thought it was interesting.  Yeah.  And did you start analyzing that?  Um, well, I hadn't considered it before.  Um, yeah, yeah. 
[04:00:30]  Yeah, probably, right?  A little bit, yeah.  Wow.  Well, listen, I mean, there are people feedback-  You know, this is a hot topic issue.  Some people are wondering why the first crop of Opie and Anthony interns all ended up getting  hired, and now we've devolved to the point where we're arguing over why, after a month,  nobody knows how to unplug a replay machine.  I'm blaming generation.  You're blaming the generation?  Oh, yeah.  It's gener-  What's your generation called?  Um, it's not Y.  Generation whatever. 
[04:01:00]  It's after, yeah, it's after Y.  Generation whatevs.  Uh, nah, that's-  How about generation rents?  Because the parents will take care of it.  We'll leave it to the rents.  Yeah.  Something like that?  Except I support myself.  Sal doesn't?  Yes, I do.  Maybe that's a new thing, but you didn't when you were an intern.  Did you support yourself when you were an intern?  No, no, no.  You support yourself, though?  I do.  It's very impressive.  Thank you.  It's very impressive, Julie.  Is it?  I'm glad we got to the bottom of this.  Uh, and I'm glad that we did all this, that we worked this thing out, because I was kind 
[04:01:30]  of bummed out after yesterday.  I felt like I wasn't hard enough on Jenny Hut.  She was not being honest.  You know her feelings get hurt all the time.  Hopefully she'll be back, and we can really grill her.  Does she never unplug a replay?  No, I wouldn't think she does.  This isn't resolved at all.  Yeah, Sal and Julie, this is only the beginning of what will no doubt go down to be a disaster.  Stay tuned.  Ron and Fez are coming up next, and we'll be back with more of this tomorrow.  Goodbye, everybody.  The O.P. and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.
