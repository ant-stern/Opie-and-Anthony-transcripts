<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with a pre-show hosted by Sam Roberts, heavily recapping the previous day's broadcast.  This included humorous segments like a discussion of a gun found in a woman's vagina, criticism of a flight attendant's overly positive announcements, and a scathing critique of the Canadian radio show Humble and Fred, punctuated by played clips.  Opie's viral camel toe video, Jim Norton's Twitter feud, and Johnny Brennan's accusations against Todd from the Todd Show for bit stealing were also discussed. A caller challenged Opie's child-related stories.  Russell Simmons was mentioned as a previous day's guest, with his comments on racial privilege and language being a topic of conversation.  Upcoming guests Sebastian Bach and Anthony Bourdain were announced.  A listener anecdote about a video game-addicted suspect unresponsive to police was shared, and New York Yankees pitcher Michael Pineda's pine tar incident was analyzed in detail.

The main show began with a segment intensely criticizing Todd Pettengill,  his recent radio show, and his split from Scott Shannon.  Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton used extremely offensive language ("fucking motherfucker," "pompous asshole," "cunt-faced hack boss") to describe Pettengill, mocking his claims of a "young, hip" and "audience-first" format, his staff's early hours (3:30 AM start), and his use of fake prank calls.  They strongly favored Scott Shannon ("Team Scott"), contrasting his style with Pettengill's.  A caller, Gaylord McGillicuddy, provided a humorous aside.  The pine tar incident in a baseball game was again discussed with crude humor.  Pettengill's staff, including Monk, Cooper Riding, and Ann/Annie, were also criticized, with sarcastic descriptions of their roles.

The show proceeded with numerous commercial breaks (Barracuda security, Famous Smoke Shop, Grasshopper virtual phone systems, Vossipedia Online) interspersed with various discussions.  A "20th Anniversary O&A Radio Gem" involved a shocking prank with baby feces and a "baby diaper mustache," resulting in vomiting.  A comedic Alex Jones parody was aired, followed by discussions on music downloads, technological advancements, the disappearance of Malaysian Airlines Flight 370, and Michael Imperioli's interpretation of *The Sopranos*.  Joan Rivers' controversial joke about the Ariel Castro kidnapping victims was debated, alongside the ensuing backlash and her response.  The phenomenon of "swatting" was discussed, followed by Diane Keaton's defense of Woody Allen.  The *People* magazine's "Most Beautiful People" issue led to discussions about celebrity attractiveness.  This segment concluded with an in-studio interview with Anthony Bourdain. Bourdain discussed his high-end sushi restaurant recommendation, his recent Detroit filming,  his dietary habits while filming, and Detroit's potential revitalization and gentrification.

Further conversation with Bourdain focused on his CNN show, including episodes filmed in Punjab, Las Vegas, and upcoming ones in Lyon. He discussed the humble backgrounds of famous chefs, Dominique Ansel and his Cronuts, and his experiences reporting from dangerous locations like Libya, the Congo, and Beirut, recounting a harrowing experience in Beirut during a war. He shared opinions on various foods, including tilapia, Chilean sea bass, raw goat kidney, blood, fermented pork, Sardinian cheese with larvae, balut, and ortolan. The discussion also included UFC fights, Bourdain's daughter's media consumption, and a caller's comments on Detroit's decline.


The show continued with more commercial breaks and a chaotic segment involving a guest named Bernie, who became upset after a CD prank.  The hosts discussed a Twitter interaction regarding Dominique Ansel's earnings and spoke briefly with a caller, Gaylord Peck-a-Lick-a.  The Today Show's apology for Joan Rivers' joke was criticized, along with the 9/11 Museum controversy. Jenny Hutt joined the show, engaging in sexually suggestive banter with the hosts.  Sebastian Bach then joined, discussing his career, experiences in the music industry (including partying, drug use, and touring with bands like Guns N' Roses and Pantera), and the changing music industry.

The interview with Sebastian Bach continued, focusing on karaoke, his appearances on "Sing Your Face Off," his past television appearances (including "Supergroup"), his vocal range, and a viral Guns N' Roses cover.  The show concluded with promotional material for Bach's album, performances, and a brief post-show segment with Diamond Dallas Page (DDP). DDP discussed his appearance on Shark Tank, DDP Yoga, various media appearances (including a negative one with Nancy Grace), his friendship with Jake Roberts and Scott Hall, their recovery, and their documentary.  The show ended with more commercial breaks and outros.

[00:01:00]  Opie and Anthony show. Only a show this big could have a pre-show this good. Welcome to  the Opie and Anthony pre-show with Sam Roberts. Good morning. Hello. We are live here on the  Opie and Anthony pre-show. My name is Sam Roberts, and we together are counting down the minutes 
[00:01:30]  before Opie and Anthony take the airwaves again one more time and literally revolutionize the  medium of radio as they do on a daily basis. Call up to be a part of the pre-show. 866-WOW-1-WOW.  866-969-1969. You can pick up the phone, and you can talk to yours truly about everything  that may be happening on today's show and everything that definitely happened on yesterday's show. 
[00:02:00]  That's what we do here on the pre-show. We break down what's happening now and try to learn from  yesterday, because that's the only way we can really guarantee what's going to be happening.  I mean, we can look at social media. Twitter was very active as far as the show went last  night. After the show, the show pretty much continued. Opie had viral stuff going on. Jim  was getting into fights. Ant was inserting himself into Jim's fights. It was great. It  was great. It was the perfect day to be an Opie and Anthony fan yesterday, because the show 
[00:02:30]  just never ended. It just kept going and going. We'll get into all that as the pre-show rolls  on. But speaking of being an Opie and Anthony fan, I think a lot of people, I know myself  included, first jumped onto the Opie and Anthony bandwagon because of the bits that just break  out on the show. No show in radio can turn something into a bit the way Opie and Anthony  do. And I don't mean like the Humble and Fred comedy bits. We'll get into that in a moment. 
[00:03:00]  I mean, this is a bit. And it's unfolding right in front of your eyes. Normally, when  you hear something like this on radio, it's something that's planned out. It's something  that is spoken about in a meeting before the show. It's choreographed and contrived. Here  on the Opie and Anthony show, nothing is choreographed or contrived. And if it is, if we try to choreograph  something, Opie and Anthony go out of their way to ruin it. So you know it's spur of the 
[00:03:30]  moment. And it went spur of the moment yesterday. We were talking about a story of cops finding  a gun in a woman's vagina. And they went a little old school. They went to a bit. Listen  to this. It's hilarious. I was thinking about it all day yesterday. Track six, Sal.  A subsequent check revealed that the five shot mini revolver, which is four inches in length,  had been stolen from an auto burglary in 2013. The handgun, which police valued at blah, blah, 
[00:04:00]  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Wow. Stolen gun in her  vagina. Oh, that's one stinky holster. That's nice. I do like that. Well, what do we got  here? Well. Well, what do we got here? Wow. She's fucking squirreling it up there. Yeah. Let  me go get my gloves. I'd have more respect for it if it was a desert eagle. Yeah. Exactly.  You're going to have to bend over a little more. Yeah. Well, we're going to have to  investigate something up there. Well, let me check that out. What is this? I best taste 
[00:04:30]  it first before we do any further investigating. I should taste that. Of course, we want to  be safe. Make sure there's no explosives. Oh, well, indeed, indeed. We're going to have  a taste test. Oh, boy, are we careful. I have to reach in and set the safety before  we try to remove it. Right. We better check the asshole just to make sure. Yes. There's 
[00:05:00]  no ammo up there. She's got an extra clip shoved up her ass. You don't know. You don't know  with people. It's 2014, after all. Snowy in Michigan. Welcome to the pre-show. Samuel  Roberts. How are you doing today, sir? Good, buddy. How about you? They went back to the  stewardess thing yesterday, and a couple things kind of occurred to me. One thing they were  saying that was surprising. Her daughters couldn't look more not alike. I was like, well, she's  a stewardess. She's probably been railed by at least a handful of pilots in her life. 
[00:05:30]  And also, Jimmy was kind of critical of her for not being like, she was being too light  nary, not harsh enough. I was like, well, what do you expect her to do on a flight?  Like, she's, you know, talking to people going on trips on an air flight. She wasn't going  dick and fart jokes or, like, cunt and all this stuff. You want to, like, you don't want  someone real vulgar doing, like, a pre-flight thing, do you?  It is probably a, you're right, Snowy, it is probably a TV PG audience. But it was interesting  that we got into it yesterday because you remember the stewardess that we were making fun of when 
[00:06:00]  Voss was in studio? Actually, we weren't really making fun of the stewardess. We more devolved  it into making fun of Voss. But you remember us talking about it last week. Opie predicted  she would be on Ellen or Jimmy Fallon. She made it to Ellen. So we were talking about that  at the top of the show yesterday. And Ant wasn't in studio when we listened to the stewardess  clip, so he hadn't heard it. And I found his take on it to be interesting. But let's hear  exactly what Snowy was talking about. It went down at the beginning of yesterday's show. 
[00:06:30]  Federal aviation regulation for car passengers are complicit. A lot of passengers are information  say it's a positive lifers, basically.  There you go. I mean, that's what I'm saying. Nobody gets hurt.  She's killing him.  This was my prediction.  What?  I wrote Anthony will hate her.  Of course.  You know what? I don't.  I sort of said the same thing on Friday.  I hate her.  I mean, I don't.  You hate her.  I hate her.  I can tell.  I can tell.  I mean, I don't hate it.  But I don't understand why they're laughing so hard at her.  I mean, she's well prepared. 
[00:07:00]  She's done that a million times.  It's obvious why.  Why?  People are nervous flying a fucking plane.  Anything that takes you out of that standard issue fucking flight makes you feel good.  You feel like if she's doing that, you're not going to crash.  Right.  For some fucking reason, you're like, oh, this plane won't crash.  We got a funny fucking flight attendant.  Yeah, you know, that's a good angle.  Yeah, people are very nervous, so they'll laugh at anything.  If the pilots make just a slight little joke or a little something.  Everything's got to be okay. 
[00:07:30]  You breathe a little easier, I think.  Isn't that good when you hear that boom?  Right.  Ladies and gentlemen, you're like, oh, oh.  Right.  If he's got time to chat with us, nothing's on fire in the cockpit.  I think if the pilots talk just a little more, I think so many more people would have an  okay time with flying.  Yeah.  But the point here, to stick up for our stand-up friends, that's what frustrated Rich and Jimmy 
[00:08:00]  as well.  It was fun to watch Vosk get so offended and annoyed, but I really don't like good-natured  stuff.  That's what annoys me.  That was good-natured.  I don't know why it bugs me.  It stinks.  They had little fun jokes that everyone on the plane likes.  You didn't like the low around the hips, like Grandma's brawn?  No.  I guess because in those moments, I think of how many brutal things you could say.  Yeah.  There's so many really mean, awful, like, I just hate the thing that makes everyone feel  okay. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, really?  Oh, really?  No, I'm like, you ought to just really fucking belly punch them.  It was making everyone feel okay.  You should heckle her, though.  Oh, wow, what, Bob?  Oh, wow, what, Bob?  Jesus.  Just ruin her act.  I think the Club Soda Kenny version of whatever the airline has would come to you if those  were your heckles.  Excuse me, sir.  There's somebody who'd like to talk to you outside of the plane.  Yeah, I got...  Snowy was right.  I mean, you can't expect a stewardess to be mean to the people who are on the plane, but 
[00:09:00]  I get where Jim's coming from.  He's coming from a comic's point of view.  He's coming from his point of view.  He's not necessarily saying he expected the type of behavior from the stewardess that  he displays on a comedy stage, but that's just where his sort of gauge of humor is, and  this was judged as humor.  I thought the stewardess did all right.  You know, I mean, she could have done a lot worse.  We've seen way worse flight attendants trying to be clever.  I mean, like, when the flight attendants rap and stuff before the flight, that's way worse 
[00:09:30]  than what this flight attendant did.  However, that doesn't mean they allow everybody to be nice.  Humble and Fred is what made up for this.  Like, you know, you want Obi and Anthony to be mean to people.  Like, you wanted Ant to hate the stewardess because there's nothing better than when Ant  goes off on somebody.  We played the clip of him just destroying Lindsay Lohan for no reason on yesterday's pre-show.  Well, it more than made up for Ant being okay with that stewardess when Humble and Fred came 
[00:10:00]  into the picture.  Humble and Fred are a radio show out of Canada that decided to take shots at the Obi and Anthony  show.  So yesterday, I went through one hour of one of their shows.  Humble and Fred said that Obi and Anthony are not funny because to be funny, you have to  do things that people would laugh at on a stage.  You have to be able, it can't just be guys in a room laughing.  They said there's a lot happening in radio where you hear people laughing but it's not 
[00:10:30]  funny and that's what Obi and Anthony are doing.  Which is, I mean, maybe they're right.  That's what we figured.  So I went through and found some of their funny bits from their show.  So, and things did not go well for Humble and Fred.  Let's go to track 10.  To open up the first hot turkey wing pub type of thing.  It's funny you say that.  Please.  I have a cousin who's from out of town. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, where is she?  Oh, no, she's going to come in a little bit.  I haven't seen her literally since I was seven years old.  So it's been, you know.  20 years.  Sure, thank you.  But her daughter goes to Humber down the street and everything.  So I got acquainted with her.  Blah, blah, blah.  Long story short, we went to this restaurant.  Tapas, you absolutely love it.  One of the things is two turkey wings.  You're kidding me.  I swear to God.  Yeah, you couldn't do that though.  Like that.  It would be way too expensive. 
[00:11:30]  This could be the most mundane show we've ever listened to as far as the whole Jocktober bit.  This is so mundane.  But my favorite part was the very last thing in that clip.  What?  Are you kidding me?  Like, oh my God, that's amazing.  The silence?  No.  He goes, I was mainly doing a bit.  What bit?  I was mainly doing a bit.  What you just heard just now.  That was a bit?  It was a bit.  Well, by me, I missed it.  A bit of what?  That's the question.  A bit of what?  A bit of bullshit is what it was. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, a bit.  That was Humble and Fred.  And if you were following Opie's Twitter last night, you saw that he retweeted somebody who had screenshotted their Facebook page.  They were trying to explain why there were some more offensive images than usual posted on their page.  I don't exactly know how they got there, but they got there.  And it's been unrelenting.  Whoever is attacking their Facebook page has been unrelenting and hilarious.  So we've been enjoying that. 
[00:12:30]  In that same segment, and we trashed them good.  I don't want to play every clip, but we really gave them a good thrashing.  And they deserved it.  But at one point, they were talking about babies, and they were talking about onesies.  Like, that was the whole thing.  There wasn't sort of a funny story about it.  There wasn't anything to it except, yeah, have you ever noticed that babies grow out of onesies really quickly?  So we were talking, and I'm serious.  That's the whole arc of the conversation that they were talking about. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, you buy them a onesie, and then they get bigger.  All right.  Like, that's what my mom talks about.  And I'm not even interested when my mom talks about it.  And she's just talking to me one-on-one.  I don't understand why she's bringing it up.  Imagine a radio show.  So a caller called.  So we were trashing them for it.  This caller called up, and I'm convinced there's a small sect of Opie and Anthony listeners  that are just trying to find things to complain about, just trying to find things. 
[00:13:30]  Oh, I can call them on this.  And so they tried it yesterday with Opie and the kids' stuff.  Listen to this clip.  Patrick in Jersey.  Patrick.  Hey, what's up, Opie?  You're a little full of shit, man, because you talk about your fucking kids all the time.  Hey, you stupid fuck.  You didn't even get my point.  Oh, shit.  First of all, I don't talk about my kids all the time, because I don't want to put them  in the public spotlight. 
[00:14:00]  And I carefully pick some of the shit that goes on at home that might be entertaining  or funny to these guys.  I don't come in here with just mundane fucking baby talk.  And that was my point.  You stupid fuck.  I'm so done with people that don't listen.  I'm so done with any jumper stories.  Never heard any jumper stories.  I purposely don't come in here with stories about my kids.  Every once in a while, I'll come up with something that might be entertaining.  Seriously, though, how quick do they outgrow their shoes? 
[00:14:30]  Exactly.  So fast.  Did I ever come in with shit like that?  A few weeks.  So fast.  I'm so sick of fucking people that don't even listen or get the point you're trying  to make.  Yeah.  I didn't say I didn't bring, you know, that I didn't talk about my kids on the show.  But I'm very careful about that, because I know how boring that could be if you bring  the wrong shit to the show.  That's why you've got to talk about, you know, what kind of little jumper.  Right, exactly.  You can't win them all, Opster. 
[00:15:00]  You can't win them all.  I mean, you know, there's always going to be stupid people out there.  The problem is that Opie's point, and it's true, was that most of the stories that Opie  brings to the table that have to do with his kids, they involve some kind of profanity  or diarrhea or something that we all enjoy.  Like, there have been very few Opie kid stories.  I can't even think of one that there hasn't been like, okay, that was funny.  The only problem anybody could have with it is they have a prejudice built in against 
[00:15:30]  kid stories.  Like, the minute anybody starts a kid story, they're, oh, you're talking about kids again.  Which is not at all.  I mean, it's just not this show.  It isn't.  Jerry in Missouri.  Sam, I hope your mom don't come back on anymore.  Well, because I have told her, I mean, she would come back on.  She's a ham.  I've told her to just stop because she went through a series of phone calls where she was  on like a couple times a week. 
[00:16:00]  At one point, Opie was just to amuse himself playing clips of Mel Gibson calling a woman  the C word and referring to my mom.  And then one day they decided to call her and ask her what her pubic hairstyle was.  So, at some point, I had to tell her to stop answering the phone.  And I don't think that's a bad thing.  Craig in Indiana, what's up?  Hey, Sam.  Love you.  Love the show.  Guys, in regards to the Humble and Fred show yesterday, if you go to their Facebook page, 
[00:16:30]  you can see their fans justifying it.  Like, oh, well, Opie and Anthony have to resort to vulgar humor to get laughs.  And they just don't get it that the Opie and Anthony show is an overall better show.  Like, people need to – that's one of these things in radio that people just never realize.  There are shows that are successful and are bad.  And those are shows you can make fun of and everything.  But sometimes a show is just a good show.  And you have to realize, like, Humble and Fred, who nobody's ever heard of outside of Toronto, 
[00:17:00]  need to realize that maybe if they ingratiated themselves to the Opie and Anthony show,  it would do them a lot better than trying to battle the monster, the Godzilla of radio that is this establishment.  Right.  Opie and Anthony are fair.  I mean, it's just the content that these other shows have just don't match up.  They're just –  They suck.  It's – it's – it's – it's – it's – it's nothing that's worth listening to.  And these other – their fans are so, you know, supportive of them, which I guess is good for them. 
[00:17:30]  But they just don't get the idea that, you know, you get the fact that Opie and Anthony show is a better show.  Well, I mean, you're 100% right.  Thanks, Craig.  And that's – and that's back to the point of there being a lot of stupid people.  Like, you can – you're always – there's – whatever you do, you'll be able to convince some people that it's good.  I'm convinced of that.  We've gone through enough jock-tobers where enough of these radio shows have somebody listening to them that there is no radio show that can't convince someone that they're good. 
[00:18:00]  However, there aren't very many that can convince as many people as Opie and Anthony have that they're good.  You know why?  Because Opie and Anthony are good.  Chris in Boston.  Yo, Sam.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, you were talking about those kids' shows, right?  I guess.  I mean, that's – no.  I feel like your show is like a kid's show, and it's really shitty, and it's a waste of my time.  Well, I mean, then there's lots of other – you could sleep at 6 o'clock in the morning.  You could –  No, I've got to be up early today, so I've got to listen to you, and it sucks. 
[00:18:30]  But Opie and Anthony are great, but I don't like you.  Well, I understand that, but the beauty of it is you're actually paying to listen to me.  You don't – there's nothing about this that is forced.  Opie and Anthony will start at 6.30, as always, so if there is any part of you that wants  to use your time more constructively, please, by all means, feel free to do so.  No, I guess I'll just listen to you and bitch about it.  Well, as I said, a lot of stupid people out there.  A lot of stupid people listening.  I never claim to be better than anybody, but I'm certainly better than Chris in Boston 
[00:19:00]  because I use my time constructively.  Lou in New Jersey.  Sammy, good morning.  How are you doing?  Ah, good.  Fuck that last caller.  I was just thinking of him.  The reason I'm calling is, uh, it retweeted Johnny Brennan yesterday from the Jerky Boys,  and I think he's got a lot of responses.  He's basically calling out Todd from the Todd show, stealing his bits and his work since  the late 80s and 90s.  Oh, it's good. 
[00:19:30]  I mean, and he has been.  And that was one of the things that was going on.  When we were talking about everything that was going on on social media yesterday, Opie's  video, uh, has got, what did you say, half a million hits on it?  That camel toe video that we were talking about on yesterday's pre-show.  And this is the thing about trying to do viral videos.  You can't.  There's no sense in trying.  Because I'm sure Opie thought it was just a throwaway thing.  Opie has poured blood, sweat, and tears into some of these videos that he puts out, and  no response, but he just films a news story. 
[00:20:00]  He takes his phone, and he records a news story that he sees with a camel toe on it, and  it's got half a million views on his channel.  That's all there is to it.  It's an amazing video, but it goes to show there is no predicting this stuff.  I mean, I guess if you have a vagina on display, your video will do well.  That's the lesson to learn.  Um, but also, Jim got into a big Twitter fight with somebody who ended up, uh, privatizing  his account.  Hopefully we'll get into that today. 
[00:20:30]  And, uh, this is what, uh, Lou in Jersey was talking about.  Uh, a lot of Todd Show stuff going on yesterday, because some article, uh, came out, uh, an interview  with Todd from the Todd Show, who's another radio show that we've, uh, criticized in the  past, that's really going over the, the way he's revolutionizing radio.  I think Eric's already got it pulled up in the studio in there right now, so they must  be talking about it.  I can't wait till they get into this.  There's very few things better than a Todd break, and we all know that E-Rock will be, 
[00:21:00]  I, I've told you, his focus on this Scott and Todd thing is unparalleled.  I don't know what it is, but when you get him on other radio shows, E-Rock, I mean, he's  unbeatable.  So he's going to be monitoring, uh, this Todd Show all day, I'm sure, as we, uh, continue to  talk about that.  But, uh, 866-WOW-1-WOW, if you want to be a part of the show, that's 866-WOW-1-WOW.  We had, uh, a great guest in studio yesterday.  We'll have some great guests today.  Okay, Sebastian Bach is going to be in studio, um, and if you remember, at some, I'm sure during 
[00:21:30]  the show today, we'll play the Good Boy Phone, Naughty Boy Phone song that he did.  He actually sang it for us, and it was amazing.  Also, in studio, Anthony Bourdain, just a fountain of life experience, this dude.  Always interesting stuff to say.  So, Anthony Bourdain and Sebastian Bach in studio today.  Yesterday was Russell Simmons.  And, I mean, he was one of the more honest guests.  He was as honest as you can expect any guest to ever be, which is a lot, because he's a 
[00:22:00]  millionaire a hundred times over.  Um, and he got into a lot of stuff.  Uh, I thought it was really interesting.  He started talking about, uh, the privilege that black people have.  It was pretty amazing.  Let's go to Trek 14 and take a listen to Russell Simmons.  We're talking about privilege shit.  Right.  You know, I think it's funny about white people can't talk about privilege shit, but black  people can.  No, no, for real.  Check this out.  Like, think about Gwyneth Paltrow, who's a lovely person.  She says, I'm eating dinner in this beautiful French restaurant in the south of France, 
[00:22:30]  and it's such and such, and you should try it.  Niggas like, fuck you to my bitch.  I'm starving.  You to my side.  They get really angry.  Like, how the fuck dare you talk about this restaurant you know I can't go to.  Right.  Right.  And Jay-Z and Beyonce will close that bitch down.  You can't go there if you want to.  They will sit in the window of the motherfucker.  Right?  They will sit in the window, eat in that French restaurant.  The chef will stand over them, and people will come by and wave and cheer.  No one will be mad.  Right?  Because I guess, you know, coming from a struggle allows you that freedom. 
[00:23:00]  But if you're in a second generation, you might not know.  You say he's black.  Let him enjoy it.  Fuck it.  White people.  How dare you eat in that restaurant knowing I can't get there?  It was, I mean, you don't hear that perspective very often.  They got in a little further.  They were talking about language.  And, I mean, Russell Simmons is a hip-hop pioneer.  If anybody is good to talk about language with, it's Russell Simmons.  And we got into it.  Let's move to track 16.  There's no good, and it's not like my nigga.  You can't say my fag. 
[00:23:30]  So there's no really good way to.  I say it every morning when I see these two.  But you can't, no, you can't.  Watch the gay ACP will get you.  Yeah, yeah.  But fag, when we were growing up, means, and I understand it's a vicious word.  No, but that's why it's vicious, because whatever it means, it's like, oh, you're just a fag.  And so I didn't mean you were gay, but you meant soft, weak, these things.  And, you know, it kind of ties into, there's no way out.  You know, there's no real explanation for that word, because it doesn't have any, there's no my nigga. 
[00:24:00]  That's my nigga.  I love, when you say, if I come to my, a group of people, white and black, who know me, right?  Like, I say, niggas, and they'll look at me and say, niggas what?  They'll be like, what do you mean?  Are you, are you happy today?  Are you, you know, you, so they won't know.  But if I walk into them, I say faggots, they'll be like.  Oh, he's pissed.  Right, exactly.  There's nothing nice about it.  But that can be, and I'm not even saying it's a nice word, it's an awful word, but it can be an affectionate thing,  like with your friends, where you don't mean, like, you know, I'm not going to, I'm not going to do this.  I don't be, come on, you faggot.  Like, when people aren't trying to be hateful.  You ain't got a lot of trouble.  You better watch it. 
[00:24:30]  But you know what I mean?  But he didn't mean it gay, but it does, and it doesn't, and without thinking about it, it doesn't mean,  but there's nothing good about it, and it all, and it's associated with a group of people, and so it's kind of hurtful, I guess.  You just can't, you can't punish people, because there was always a social justice.  But I wouldn't punish anybody for that, you know, and I, but I, but I, but I'm not, you know, the judge, I'm not the judge.  It is, it is odd that so many people call for firings and all kinds of repercussions when somebody trips up.  People are born, but people are born into a life, a life of unequal treatment. 
[00:25:00]  They live an entire life, and the world won't change before they die, that their entire community is under the gun.  They're born into a life where they will be unequal, no matter how much work they do to change it.  They're going to die, and this world will still treat them unequal.  And that's a very, very heavy weight to carry.  Women, too.  True, Russell Simmons, true. 
[00:25:30]  I've been talking to multiple people.  I've been telling them about the show segment a few days ago when Jim Norton did not know, he knew one of Pharrell's top ten songs.  We were going down Billboard's list, and it was the top ten songs Pharrell has been associated with, or produced, or sang on, or whatever.  And, you know, I wasn't making the argument that he should like the songs, but the fact that he didn't know them boggled my mind. 
[00:26:00]  And we had a moment like that yesterday with Russell Simmons in studio.  Let's go to track 15.  And I thought about the criticism of her being so cruel and so unusual and mean.  It was sort of unnecessary.  It's all the time.  It's all the time.  You know, because she mentioned the wrong restaurant.  Yeah.  You know.  I mean, plus, remember the niggas in Paris thing?  Oh, my God.  She was with the niggas in Paris.  She shouldn't have said it.  And I said, but give her a pass.  Come on.  Right, right, right.  She said, I'm with the, she's with Kanye and Jay.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:26:30]  She said, I'm with the niggas in Paris.  And she tweeted that.  I was, whoa, that'll end with it.  That was her Harriet Tubman.  Wait, is that, is that, is that a quote?  That was her, that was her moment, you know, where she's like, I made a mistake.  Whoops.  What's the, what's the quote?  What was the, what was the quote?  She simply said, I'm with the niggas in Paris.  And she showed a picture of her and Kanye and Jay.  Yeah, right.  I saw the tweet.  I saw the tweet.  And I was like, damn, she's in Paris, bitch.  Like, I was just jealous.  Right, right.  Like, you didn't think like, oh, shit, the next day, boy, and a little bit of trouble.  But is the niggas in Paris a song, or is that just.  It's a huge song.  They played the song like 5,000, at the end of the show, they played that song like 5,000 
[00:27:00]  times.  Okay.  They, they both have an enormous number of hit records, right?  Obviously, their libraries are ridiculous.  The song niggas in Paris, and that comes on in a concert.  People just start going fucking crazy.  It's a huge record.  And so, that was the name of the tour.  Yeah.  And the name of the show in Paris was obviously niggas in Paris.  Right, right.  And she was there with them, and said that, and man.  Name of the album.  Did she apologize, or no?  She, um.  Or no.  I would hope not.  Well, no.  I would think that it's just, if I'm, like me, if I offended anybody, I'm sorry. 
[00:27:30]  You know?  And I, but I don't believe, by the way, I don't think, um, if you don't have a slave  directly in your ancestry that you can point to, then you can't probably use the word.  Like, you guys can't, unless I gave you my super, rabbinical supervision, if I allowed  you to say it once you could, but then I wouldn't do it, because then tomorrow we'd be talking  about it.  You'd be like, hey, man, shit.  We don't want that pressure.  I, I, I guess we shouldn't be surprised at this point.  I couldn't believe Jim had never heard of the song Niggas in Paris. 
[00:28:00]  Like, that was the biggest song when it came out, to the point where, I was telling Sal,  when Kanye West and Jay-Z took it on tour, they played it five times in a row.  That's true.  It's absurd.  And people were still going nuts for it, but that song was everywhere.  Every, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot.  If you heard it, you'd know it.  I mean, I, what, plus the title was everywhere, because it was a, a controversial title.  So, uh, I hope we have time.  I really want, quick, wanted to get into Kenny's jokes from yesterday. 
[00:28:30]  Let's at least play the first one.  Let's go to track four, because Kenny was really proud of this.  Uh, yes, uh, Kenny.  Before you go to break, I heard a good knock-knock joke yesterday.  Could I tell it?  Wait, let me get the dumb button here.  I'll, my finger's on the dumb button.  All right.  And I'll say the whole thing.  Like, you don't have to say who's there or anything.  I want to.  That's part of the fun, Kenny.  I don't think I've ever enjoyed a knock-knock joke.  What do you mean you heard a good one?  I don't know.  I, I enjoyed this one.  All right.  Go ahead, Kenny. 
[00:29:00]  Knock-knock.  Who's there?  The police.  What do you want?  We want to talk.  How many are you?  There's two of us.  Then talk to yourselves.  He's enjoying himself.  He's cracking himself up.  Then talk to yourselves. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  He goes, yeah.  It should have been.  First of all, A, that was, it's arguably the worst joke I've ever heard.  It's terrible.  B, it should have been talk to each other.  Right.  Right.  Then talk to each other.  Right.  Talk to yourselves.  Why would two men stand outside just mumble to themselves?  It's too weird.  Right.  I wish it was knock-knock who's there, Pistorius.  Leave it to Ant to save a punchline.  Well, Kenny thought his knock-knock joke was the niggas in Paris of knock-knock jokes, 
[00:30:00]  because it was time to come back for round two.  There was a problem.  I guess the cops were outside this kid's door.  The cops tried for 20 minutes to call Raphael to get him to come out, but he had headphones  on and was still glued to his video game console.  He didn't realize anything was going on.  He couldn't hear anything, his brother said.  I told him there's a bunch of cops outside that are looking for you.  Graphics are great.  Can you imagine if you got Call of Duty or did Call of Duty just cranking through the  house, though, as the SWAT team shows up?  Oh, man.  Holy shit.  Right?  Can you imagine you're playing Call of Duty and then real cops burst in? 
[00:30:30]  And you're like, this fucking game rules.  It's just a 3D effect.  Right.  It's amazing.  Yes, Kenny.  Well, you know how it went down.  How did it go down?  The cops knocked on the door, and the people said, who's there?  And the cops said, it's the police.  Right.  And they said in the house, how many are there?  They said there's two of us.  How many are there?  So they said, talk to each other.  Much better.  I got you both times.  I got you. 
[00:31:00]  What do you mean, you got it?  Didn't he say got you both times?  Yeah.  Those guys got to know when they've been gotten.  I think that's fair.  Ah.  Big show.  Big show today.  Anthony Bourdain in studio.  Sebastian Bach in studio.  Opie has a video that is on the verge of going viral.  Of course, we'll be talking about the Todd interview.  Maybe a little Humble and Fred.  Jim's Twitter argument.  And the missing plane has not been found.  Just more sheet metal in the water.  What the hell is in the ocean? 
[00:31:30]  God damn it.  The Opie and Anthony show.  So much to get to.  Luckily, we'll start getting to it right now.  Because that is when the show begins.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie one.  And the other side of the story. 
[00:32:00]  It was an insecure book.  I guess we'll go in a drought.  We'll be looking back.  We'll go into the rain.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Thank you. 
[00:32:30]  Thank you. 
[00:33:00]  Thank you. 
[00:33:30]  Thank you. 
[00:34:00]  Thank you. 
[00:34:30]  Thank you. 
[00:35:00]  Thank you. 
[00:35:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Two 55-gallon drums and whiffle ball bats.  You push it in until you're comfortable.  From mayors to mayor.  It was an April Fool's hoax by two radio disc jockeys.  With bottle rockets and brow bombings.  And wieners and pigs.  Opie and Anthony got their hands on the photo and tweeted it. 
[00:36:00]  Two men that have taken a box of cocks further than any.  Well, these people will definitely stop.  Guaranteed.  Lift off the camera.  They've met friends along the way.  And through fine scandals, suspensions, cancellations, and terminations, it's the one show that remains unscathed.  Striking fear into the heart of management everywhere comes a radio show that after 20 years remains above all else, real. 
[00:36:30]  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yes.  Good morning, everyone.  Oh, there he is right there.  One of our vice guys is being held hostage in the Ukraine.  Yeah.  U.S. journalist held hostage. 
[00:37:00]  Simon, I don't know how to say his last name.  Man, we're friends with all those guys.  Hope he's going to be all right.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Got to get Shane on the show, man.  Yeah, ha.  Simon, um...  Simon LeBowl?  Strauss.  Simon LeBowl.  But he's with those pro-Russian, um...  I don't know if they're rebel forces or what they're called in the Ukraine.  Right.  But, uh, I mean, I think he has a shot at being okay, because their statement, at least, they admitted that they had him and they were just investigating something, so... 
[00:37:30]  Oh, okay.  Hopefully they are all right.  Is it reasonable?  That should work out all right.  Hopefully.  Yeah, it's like usually the religious groups that really scare me, so hopefully they're not religious zones.  Right.  All right.  Mmm.  Scary.  Here we are for another day of broadcasting.  Indeed.  Hi, everybody.  We got Anthony Bourdain and Sebastian Bach coming in the studio today.  That's pretty cool.  We haven't seen Anthony Bourdain in a while. 
[00:38:00]  Another friend of the show.  Mm-hmm.  I'm a big fan of his, uh, of his show.  Although, I haven't watched this season yet.  Uh-oh.  I usually, you know...  You're going to tell him that or try to...  No, I'll tell him that.  I'll just try to, you know, muddle through.  No, I'll tell him that, but I'll also tell him how great that Detroit episode was.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I freaking loved it.  And it set me down a course of searching out all sorts of videos about Detroit.  Detroit.  Detroit.  On YouTube and seeing some of those documentaries and... 
[00:38:30]  Oh, no.  I always pile on to Jimmy's watching of some program when we have a guest.  Jimmy goes, yeah, I saw it.  It was great.  You know, I liked it the way...  And I go, oh, yeah, yeah.  Like, and then they look at me like, oh, he saw it, too.  It's great.  And I'm like, all right, I do that, too.  And I'm lying to begin with.  You just jump on Jimmy's back.  I should.  Because Jimmy's like a go-getter.  He still watches all this stuff and reads the books. 
[00:39:00]  We gave up on that, what, at least five, six years ago?  You know, isn't it more interesting to get the person to talk about it?  You know, I like to be surprised.  I represent the person that hasn't seen it yet.  You know what I mean?  So I ask the questions maybe that person would ask.  Yeah.  Man, your boy is a dummy.  You're a Yankees fan, right?  Oh, yeah, okay.  Are you a Yankees fan?  Sure.  I just tweeted the picture for the rest of the country, but Michael Pineda, is that 
[00:39:30]  how you say it?  Or Pineda?  Pineda, how do you say it?  Pineda, patata.  It might be Pineda because it doesn't have that over the end.  Pineda.  Yeah, yeah, it doesn't have the little wacky thing.  Pineda.  Pineda.  Pineda.  So Michael Pineda, Pineda, freaking pitches for the Yankees.  And very recently, it seems like it was only a week ago, right?  Yeah, yep.  He got caught.  He didn't officially get caught.  No, he squeaked by. 
[00:40:00]  But there were suspicions about him using some pine tar.  Yeah.  And it was on the ball, I believe.  It was on his hand.  Oh, it was on his hand, like on the side or whatever, on the top, right?  On the top, right?  On his hand.  And they investigated and they were basically, they didn't have anything.  No, he went into the dugout, came back out, and they were checking it when he came back  out, and he had already gotten rid of it.  He washed it off.  Yeah.  But they did have some pictures and still.  Oh, and it was obvious.  And it was very obvious, but they did not catch him officially. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  And it was a huge sports story.  I think most of the people that follow sports understand that.  And so what does this dummy do, the next time he plays the same team, the Red Sox, he does  it again.  Wouldn't you think that if you're playing the Sox again, and it's the first time you're  pitching since that last thing happened, that they're all just going to be looking at you  and seeing if you have shit on you?  Yeah, because they all felt like he got away with it.  Right.  So they were mad, and they're like, okay, he's pitching again, so let's take a closer 
[00:41:00]  look.  Yeah, a real close look.  So they find the pine tar right on his neck.  On his neck.  So his thinking may have been, they'll never think I'm doing this since we just had it.  The image is so obvious, he's decided to go for it.  Hiding in plain sight.  But that's just dumb, I think.  It's pretty stupid.  So what happens?  They kicked him out of the game, and he's going to be in Dutch.  He'll get some suspension time.  Yeah, Yanks hurler ejected for neck goop.  And the picture that's on the front page of all the papers today, and like I said, I tweeted 
[00:41:30]  if you want to check it out.  It's painfully obvious.  Yeah.  The pine tar on his neck makes it look like he has some kind of open wound.  And what did he assume, that the pine tar just blends in with his skin type?  With his skin color.  Yeah.  Like a white guy can't get away with spreading pine tar on his neck.  No one will see it.  What did Travis say before the show?  That was really funny, Travis.  You were the one that said...  Nolan Ryan wouldn't be able to get it in. 
[00:42:00]  No, no, no.  Nolan Ryan with pine tar on his neck.  No.  Yeah, they...  If I was one of these guys that thought the pine tar was close to my skin color, I would  have just done my entire face.  You think you'd do your entire face and neck?  I'd just look very shiny and sweaty.  And the umps would be sitting there going, I'd like to say something, but is this racist?  Right.  Because we...  What if we accuse him of pine tar all over his face, but if he doesn't have it, then we're 
[00:42:30]  racistists.  Those guys used to hide on their uniform.  Like, they would have these pre-pitch rituals, like where they would just touch the shoulders  and the hat brim is a hat.  You can't do the hat brim.  The hat brim is a whole school, right.  But they used to do...  It started with the hat brim, and then people were like, okay, we're on to the hat brim.  So then you're right.  They hid it elsewhere.  The necros were known for that, right?  And Roley Fingers.  Roley did it.  I think he used to hide something under the hat.  It was the wax.  Oh, you think it was the wax in his mustache?  On his roly-poly mustache. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, those knuckleballers, man.  Those guys that need the ball to just dip and drop and do all that weird shit.  What was the other one's name?  Gaylord?  Gaylord Perry.  Gaylord Perry.  Yeah.  Here's another one.  Why would you name your son Gaylord?  Gaylord.  Oh, my God.  I guess that used to be like a classy name.  You want to talk about...  Royalty.  Words hurt.  Yes.  That's a rough one.  Gaylord.  You can't name your kid Gaylord.  You just can't.  No.  I'm in a lot of playgrounds.  There's no more Gaylords. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, boy.  I'll tell you right now.  No Gaylords out at the schools?  No, that name has gone away.  Oh, I was just talking about my kids indirectly.  Sorry about that.  Uh-oh.  I apologize.  Yawn.  So, that's going to be a problem for Michael Panetta.  Yeah, no one seems to really care.  Joe Girardi's not like, you know, ah, you know, this can't happen.  We're outraged.  He's just like, ah, you know, it was cold. 
[00:44:00]  He was trying to put something on his hands.  He got a little extra grip.  Well, I think most of these guys are trying to, you know, get away with a little something-something.  A little advantage.  Yeah.  Well, they lost the game, by the way.  To the Sox.  Yeah.  That's good.  How many games to go?  192.  It's like a fuckload.  Jesus cares.  It doesn't matter at this point.  I was down in Philly last weekend, and they had the Phillies on, and I'm just sitting there  remembering when I used to be a baseball fan, and I'm sitting there.  It was a good game, too, and I'm like, this game just doesn't matter. 
[00:44:30]  Like, how did, I don't know.  I think times have just, have just changed.  Yeah.  A shorter baseball schedule would be amazing.  I don't know.  It would be amazing.  If you, if you played every team in your division just once.  Yeah.  Once.  A lot of money, though.  Knock it down to 80 games.  That would be an amazing season.  A lot of money to be made with all those games, though.  But maybe there's another way they could, you know, figure out how to, you know, get  that money or something. 
[00:45:00]  I don't know.  I think it would just be unbelievable if you had, like, an 80-game season.  Wow, this video is everywhere.  Look, they're pointing to his neck.  Oh, yeah.  The ump had to, like, touch it.  Oh, my.  It's like, you're out of here.  Right.  Tar on the side of Pineda's neck.  You can see that sort of streak there along the way.  It's so obvious.  It's really obvious in college.  You don't know.  The game.  Yeah.  Meanwhile, the sock's right at the arm of John Black.  That's it.  In the paper, you can kind of see it.  Kind of.  I think it's obvious in the paper, too.  Wow.  That is so obvious. 
[00:45:30]  I mean, what is he thinking?  Maybe he put it at the same spot.  Hopefully, everyone would think it's a birthmark.  Right.  And they watch the way you touch your neck.  Oh, yeah.  Like, you know.  Especially if they were suspicious that you were doing it last time.  That's just it.  You would think you would just hang low for a while and go, okay, I think I'm safe.  Let me try this again.  They're going to look.  And they feel the ball.  They'll feel the ball.  You know, the umpire goes, give me that ball.  They'll feel it.  And that's got to be just embarrassing.  Now you're walking off the field because you're cheating.  You're a cheater. 
[00:46:00]  Well, there's something so old school about getting busted with pine tar or Vaseline on  your fingers.  It really is.  I don't think anybody, other players give a fuck.  They know that happens.  Yeah.  They get it.  They didn't even know until Ortiz saw it on TV and told his manager.  And then they checked him out, according to Sal in Tampa.  Really?  They didn't notice.  Sal, that's how it went down, huh?  Yeah.  So, uh, Ortiz is watching it in the clubhouse and all of a sudden he comes out because Pineda  didn't have it at the beginning.  And then he, uh, Ortiz comes out and whispers to Farrell. 
[00:46:30]  Well, he's got pine tar on his frigging neck and you could see him because see Ortiz laughing  and Farrell waited like one pitch and went out there and told the ump when the ump walks  out there, the ump's checking the God, you've probably seen it on the video.  Yeah, yeah.  The glove.  And, and Pineda's facing the opposite way.  So, like, he doesn't think he's ever going to check the right side of his neck.  And, and they asked Farrell before the game, do you think there'll be any pine tar issues? 
[00:47:00]  And, and Farrell said something to the effect of, well, if there is, I hope he hides it  better.  Oh, my God.  Put it right on his neck.  Look at the video.  They're showing it.  Oh, my God.  Look how obvious that is.  He's one of these dummies that wears his hat to the side, too.  The guy, he's not too bright, I don't know.  What that is, it looks like a bright, shiny, like he was lacquered on the side of his neck.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  And it's not old school TV.  Everyone has, uh, HD now. 
[00:47:30]  So, yeah, you're just looking at it.  If you're watching the game of the 70s, you might be able to get away with that.  That's funny.  Even the 80s, but.  Yeah, yeah.  Everything is pretty much 3D, HD.  It's right there in your face.  Whatever.  4D.  Thank you, Sal, for filling in the blanks on that one.  That's pretty obvious.  It's a great story, because it's so ridiculous.  Xbox, go to news.  Oh.  Xbox.  Oh, what's the matter?  You don't like talking to your Xbox?  It ignores me.  Oh.  No, it's not happening to me. 
[00:48:00]  It can't ignore you.  Nothing happens.  The Xbox just owns my TV, and I turn it on, and I look at the Xbox joystick thing, and  nothing moves.  No, Jimmy.  It works.  I swear.  Good for it.  Maybe your voice is too weak.  Yeah, maybe it is.  I'm like, Xbox.  There's more to this story, by the way.  Chris in Boston.  I hope we have this clip that he's referring to.  Go ahead, Chris.  Hey, fellas.  Hey.  Yeah, it's obvious to everybody, except from Ms. Waldman and Mr. John Sterling. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, yeah?  Oh, my God.  We need that clip.  If you pull the clip, it sounds like they don't even have a TV in front of them, so they have  no idea what's going on.  What, they're like, he's getting thrown out, but they have no idea?  Yeah, and then out of nowhere, the dummy goes, oh, and Derek Jeter's there.  It's like he's going to do something.  Derek Jeter knew!  I do want to hear that clip.  Can we find that?  Stupid Susan Waldman.  Any opportunity to hear the wonderful Susan Waldman. 
[00:49:00]  With her heavy Boston accent, as she's a Yankees fan.  There's obviously pine tar all over his neck, John.  John.  Get checking him, John.  I don't see it.  I don't see it, I'm sure.  That's wicked stupid.  It's fucking...  All right, Cripple.  On the television, it's obvious.  Oh, obvious, right.  All right, see you, boy.  All right.  The difference between pine tar and Vaseline, do we need to go this deep? 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, look at it.  Go ahead, Joe.  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey, Joe.  Being a former pitcher, and I'm not defending the Yankees because I fucking hate the Yankees.  Right.  I'm a Sox fan.  But the difference between pine tar and, like, Vaseline is pine tar is used in cold weather  so you can keep a grip on the ball.  Yeah.  Where Vaseline's used to get to where you can manipulate the ball to get more spin for, like,  a nasty-ass curve or a nasty slider.  So I don't see where the big deal is about the pine tar because, I mean, Roseline is basically 
[00:50:00]  like baby powder.  Uh-huh.  It doesn't really help.  So I don't know what the big deal is.  And that's coming from a Sox fan, so...  I would assume if there's anything on the ball that these guys know how to manipulate it  and get a little something extra out of it.  They've been saying that people do it all the time.  Right.  They use pine tar, but just don't fucking make it obvious.  It's one of those things like, and don't do it the week after you were fucking called 
[00:50:30]  out for doing it.  Right.  Like, in the news, he's just an idiot for doing this.  He's very stupid.  Dip a couple of fingertips in the pine tar before you go out to the mound.  Right, right.  All right.  It's going to wear off, but you get a few pitches in, you know?  Yeah.  What will pine tar do to the ball?  What exactly does it do?  Just makes it stickier.  What we did in college was our catcher kept it on as shin guards, and he would wipe his  hand on the shin guard and throw the ball back to you.  It'd get a little tackiness to it.  Oh, all right.  That way, in cold weather, you know, nothing's ever said. 
[00:51:00]  You know what's funny?  Like, we suck so bad, we could probably dip the whole baseball in pine tar and nothing  would happen if we threw it.  Oh, please.  We wouldn't even know the difference.  These guys don't know how to manipulate.  Yeah.  All right, Joe.  Thank you, buddy.  No problem.  Yeah, you just can't make it...  You can't have it smeared on your neck like he had.  Yeah, that was terrible.  And then act like, what?  What?  There was a whole what?  What?  What?  Was he doing what?  What?  A little bit.  What?  What?  What?  What?  Oh, that?  Nothing better than the what.  What?  What? 
[00:51:30]  What?  What?  What?  It said in the paper here, Pineda's obvious violation forced Red Sox to cry foul, and they show  a photo.  And it's like a band...  It's like picture a dark black Band-Aid on his neck.  That's how obvious it is.  Oh, yeah.  Very obvious.  Yeah, that's a really, really stupid...  Anyway, I got some excitement.  Sam, did the Undertaker die last night?  What happened?  Someone's on hold.  No.  Okay.  Oh, boy.  I don't...  All right.  Jesus.  All of a sudden, you know, the collective fucking... 
[00:52:00]  Oh!  Yeah.  Tom, you're a liar.  You're just lying...  Oh, he hung up.  Okay.  Ah.  Oh.  So, that's a huge story today, though, the Pine Tar.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Also, a huge story today is Todd Pettengale's interview with All Access.  You were talking about this on your Twitter last night, Ant, a little bit.  Oh, fuck.  This thing is brutal.  This radio business is fucking awful.  Yeah.  We probably should have moved on from this years ago, because now it's just embarrassing  to be part of this. 
[00:52:30]  I'm kind of glad we're out of that portion of radio where people are still doing that  interview.  Right.  We never did this interview.  Thank God.  Todd, he did an interview with All Access, which is one of the trade...  It's a big deal.  All Access is a big deal still.  Yeah.  And especially the regular radio world.  And that interview could have been taken and just put in a magazine from the 80s or  90s on radio.  Right. 
[00:53:00]  There's nothing new happening there.  It's full of the same cliches.  The funniest part was reading when him and his staff wake up and go in and leave.  What?  It's like, for that show, he should be able to show up at fucking five minutes to six.  And he winds up like, well, I get in at 3.30.  It's through what?  And then he's there until late into the afternoon.  Doing what? 
[00:53:30]  Exactly.  That's what I was...  I'm reading this and going, what is he doing?  Practicing his fake voice in the sales department?  Coming up with the wacky names for the phone calls?  What are you talking about?  Yeah.  We talk way more.  And I get here a half hour early just because I like to just sit and just chill out.  Yeah.  You guys roll in about five, ten minutes before the show.  I like to walk in halfway through ecstasy.  He's going to be yelling.  No, it's about 15 minutes.  I was exaggerating for the radio.  Tim.  No, I get in about five minutes up. 
[00:54:00]  The answer is always here when I'm here.  I literally walk in.  Dun, dun, dun, dun.  Hi, guys.  How are you?  I see that light going outside.  Outside.  But if you know what you're doing and if you're prepping the whole day, as much as we joke  about it, as soon as the show's over, I'm starting to think about the next show and  you're jotting little things down or I'm punching it into your phone and you're just  trying to be aware the entire day.  So I don't understand why we would have to be here at 3.30 like he's doing. 
[00:54:30]  3.30.  And then he leaves in the afternoon?  Afternoon.  And he's like, and the staff knows what I expect of him.  Ah, what?  He goes, yeah, I know.  He goes, the staff knows what I expect of them and that's everything.  Oh, God.  It's the worst.  I read this just going, oh, imagine having to be around this fucking motherfucker.  I didn't like the way he opened it and the way he dressed Todd.  Didn't that seem kind of shitty?  Scott, yeah.  Scott, I'm sorry.  Yes, he did.  Well, I mean, we can pick our favorite questions because this is a long article, but I think 
[00:55:00]  a lot of our audience knows the Scott and Todd show, of course, from Jocktober.  And now they've split up and we're Team Scott all the way.  Because Jim pointed it out and we all jumped on board that Todd's the problem.  Yes.  For a while we thought Scott was the problem, like he was just an old guy that maybe his  time has passed.  But he's proven that, no, he's still capable of doing it.  And sounds way better than he did with the Scott and Todd show.  I would love to hear Todd's side of this for real. 
[00:55:30]  Like, I would love to ask him what happened.  Wouldn't it be funny if Todd was really the nice guy?  And you said, what happened?  He was like, every day I'm in the office and Scott would walk in and spit on me.  Like if he had some legit reason.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I've heard things.  He's a little full of himself.  Todd.  Please give us a short recap on the Scott and Todd era and 23 years together.  Listen to how he describes 23 years with Scott Shannon. 
[00:56:00]  Scott Shannon, who brought him in, by the way.  These fuckers.  Scott brings Todd in, and this is the thanks he gets.  He would have never made it to New York if Scott didn't decide to bring him in.  It was a great run, but I think, like Leno and Letterman, Scott decided it was time to  move on and hang up the headphones in the hot AC format.  Like the hot AC format is still a young, hip format.  Oh, yeah.  He's turning 70 this year, and God bless him. 
[00:56:30]  I only hope to live that long.  Doing oldies is right in his wheelhouse.  That's like saying he just deserves to go to the home.  Out to pasture.  Yeah, out to pasture.  Right.  Exactly.  That's what he's trying to...  The old folks home.  But Todd isn't a young guy either.  No.  So what is he talking about?  You know, that really is a...  I think he's older than us.  I really believe that.  Wouldn't you respect him more if they didn't like each other, if he said, look, we stopped  getting along after a while, and he went there and I stayed here.  Honesty? 
[00:57:00]  I would respect that, though.  If he just said, look, we stopped getting along.  Right.  Like, okay, it happens.  Right.  Hold on a minute.  We got a Gaylord on the line.  We got to take all Gaylord phone calls today.  Gaylord.  Yes, hello.  I'm sorry that we were laughing at your name earlier.  It's okay.  I'm a junior, and my family wants me to pass on the name to my son, and I fucking refuse.  Oh, my God.  You can't name your kid Gaylord.  Or name him GL. 
[00:57:30]  Right.  And it gets worse.  My nickname, they don't call me Gay, they call me Gale.  Gale?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  How do you worry?  I'm trying to think, all right, what could you be called Gaylord?  Because the obvious would be everyone would just call you Gay.  Gay.  Do they call you Lord?  But that's too pompous.  Your Highness?  Right.  Yeah.  It's just a...  They can't do anything with my last name, because my last name sucks, too. 
[00:58:00]  What is it?  McGillicuddy.  It is not.  Oh, no.  Well, listen here, Ms. McGillicuddy.  There's no way your name is Gaylord McGillicuddy.  Junior, to make it worse.  Gee, Ms. McGillicuddy.  Well, let me tell you a little story about the Opster.  My mom stepped in.  I'm supposed to be.  And this is the truth.  Frederick Wilfred Hughes III.  And my mom stepped in when I was born and said, Hannah. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, Hannah.  Oh, Hannah.  Oh, Hannah.  And she broke the chain.  She said, no fucking way are we naming our son Frederick Wilfred Hughes III.  That's an older gentleman name.  That's brutal, right?  Hey, this is Gaylord McGillicuddy.  Hey, I gotta be disloyal to my partner who brought me in.  And now I'm the young, hip guy.  At what, 55 years old, I would guess? 
[00:59:00]  A-A-R-P, I belong to.  Oh.  All right.  Can I have a straw?  Nope, didn't hear you.  Bye, guys.  All right, thank you, Gaylord.  I'm so happy.  He didn't.  See, I can't believe there's Gaylords out there.  That's crazy.  Gaylord.  We have the Sterling Waldman Panetta clip.  Yeah.  Why don't you just put the pine tar on your taint? 
[00:59:30]  Because then they'll pass to, like, he has to get in there and poke around.  He's got to get in there.  Imagine if before a pitch he reached his hand down his pants and had to brush by his asshole,  how obvious that would be.  Oh, put it in between your ball bag and your leg.  Perfect place.  But then you put your hand down your pants.  That's good.  That's easy to do.  Yeah, just adjusting my cup.  Right.  And then you just wipe it on that seam and get some pine tar and some of that scrotum sweat.  Oh, Jesus.  Put a ball smelling like an onion.  Right.  There was something very, um, very, um, I don't know, watching that big, fat, white umpire 
[01:00:00]  inspecting the black gentleman.  And poking him.  It was something very, like, all right, people, let's line up here.  It was almost like he was checking his bone structure.  Right, right, exactly.  Very Giamatti of him.  Yes, exactly.  He was very careful, though, to how he poked them.  He was very careful.  But there was something very kind of, all right, people, let's all get in line here. 
[01:00:30]  Right.  Right.  Hey, whatever.  So we got, uh, John Sterling and Susan Wallman talking about the pine tar incident.  I guess they didn't know.  Now, here's John Farrell.  And if you say to me, well, why is he out?  I have no idea.  Now, now, look, even if you didn't see the fucking pine tar and didn't know anything,  wouldn't you assume that because of what happened the last time he pitched against the Red Sox 
[01:01:00]  that I have no idea what, that you could speculate, like, maybe they're checking him for pine tar.  And he has his monitors in front of him.  Right.  It's so obvious.  Wow.  That there's something going on on his neck.  You have no idea.  None.  This is your world.  You live and breathe this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where's your awareness to go, well, yeah, exactly.  Well, I'm going to say the exact same thing you did.  But, yeah, you break it down and go, okay, why would he be out there? 
[01:01:30]  And then you quickly go through the Rolodex.  Okay, wait, last time.  Last week.  Okay, so maybe, at least bring that up.  Yeah.  Deal.  I wonder if that has anything to do with Pineda.  Oh, Dave.  Okay.  All right.  Well, and it evidently does.  And here's Jerry Davis going to the mound.  And he's going to talk to Pineda.  And, of course, that means that sooner or later, Joe Girardi will come out. 
[01:02:00]  He looks at his hand.  Now he looks at the glove.  Look at the crowd.  Now he's looking at the hand.  His hand is clean.  Both hands are clean.  Now they're looking at the belt.  Derek Jeter's standing right there.  They were doing fine until that.  Pusada knew.  Oh, my God.  There's no need to know that.  Big smile.  Yeah. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  Jeter has a bulldog at home.  Stop throwing impertinent information.  Don't care.  It would be horrible.  A clue.  Jesus.  Still not even a guess?  No.  Looking at the belt.  Derek Jeter's standing right there.  He was the first one over there looking at the back of the neck.  And he got thrown out of the game.  So Pineda must have had something on his neck.  Don't worry about it.  The Yankees will do this with Boston pitchers. 
[01:03:00]  So Pineda's been thrown out of the game.  And Farrell's got every right to do that.  But let me tell you, two of their pitchers are known to use stuff.  And this is going to start something that maybe John Farrell isn't going to want to start by the end of the year.  Yeah.  His pitchers put oil in their hair until they go back and touch their long, stringy hair to put something on the ball.  This goes on in baseball all the time and has since it began. 
[01:03:30]  But now Girardi has to get himself a pitcher.  Well, too bad he got caught.  No.  That's the way it is.  But I understand they're, you know, they're Yankees fans.  Yeah, yeah.  Yankee fans, whatever.  But, I mean, the guy almost got caught last time.  So, you know, you put the ump in a bad position.  Right.  So he has to call it this time.  Got to.  He has to.  And you also can't make it just blatantly obvious like he did.  But it's cool.  Look at this.  That's brilliant. 
[01:04:00]  There you go.  You're good.  Look ridiculous.  Yeah, they have to throw him out, though.  And that's baseball.  You know, you get pine tar, you get busted.  Yeah.  You got to get booted.  Yeah, yeah.  That's all it is.  All right.  Back to the Todd Pettengill interview for All Access.  Working on my John Sterling.  Oh.  It's pretty good.  Almost there.  It's pretty good.  So, what's different about the Todd show now that readily apparent?  So, what's different about the Todd show now that readily apparent? 
[01:04:30]  That doesn't make sense, sort of.  It's missing something.  Probably an S.  Hold on.  What are you saying?  So, what's different about the Todd show now that readily apparent?  It should be that is readily apparent.  Right?  Okay.  And this is what Todd says as the young kid in town.  Ah.  I think we joke about how young we are.  Oh, please.  I think it's pretty obvious that we're not as young as we are.  But this guy is really trying to make everyone believe he's a young go-getter. 
[01:05:00]  Oh, yeah.  New kid on the block.  New kid on the block.  He did 23 years with Scott Shannon, and he did a bunch of years before that.  Yeah.  It's a faster-paced, more aggressive, audience-first,  lifestyle show.  It's more visible, topical, and local.  Local.  In the past.  Takes another shot at Scott Shannon.  Yeah, yeah.  Scott would talk about things he called knuckleheads, which were the weird stories from around the 
[01:05:30]  country.  Now, we talk about the real stories from our community, and the things that directly relate  to the target audience.  Do you do that during the phony phone calls that aren't real?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is that the real?  And what is he talking about?  And what's wrong with the...  Real stories from the community?  Local.  Local New York stories.  I know, but it's local.  Who cares?  See, we were in that world, and when we were syndicated on regular radio, that's how they  attacked us.  Like, hey, they can't do local stuff, so make sure you do local stuff. 
[01:06:00]  No one cares.  No one cares if you're entertaining.  If you're entertaining, it doesn't matter if it's some national story, or even just taking  a local story and going with it.  Yeah.  So...  And those weird stories still work.  Yeah, it doesn't matter where they're fucking from.  He's making fun of the fact that Scott Shannon used to do those weird stories.  Mm-hmm.  Those are the ones that get the people talking around the water cooler.  Yeah.  And calling the show, right?  You think people that watch a video on YouTube care where it's from? 
[01:06:30]  Right.  That's not a local video.  You play about four songs an hour from 6 to 10 a.m. during the show.  Wow.  God, I wish we could do this.  That was the audience.  How easy would that be?  The guy plays four songs an hour, and he gets to work at 3.30 in the morning?  Unbelievable.  Four songs is what?  Let's say...  16 minutes, maybe?  15 minutes?  Yeah, knock it down slightly.  So let's say 15 minutes.  Uh-huh.  And then you got at least 20 minutes of commercials an hour. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  At least.  Yeah.  So now you only have to talk for 25 minutes an hour?  Yep.  And they're not even doing that, because then you squeeze in the traffic and the weather.  Oh, yeah.  When Scott was on the air, he would be doing his true oldie show at the same time.  So many times he would be out of the room, and we'd throw in another record.  Now it's all about the content.  We play the hottest songs in the morning.  Who cares?  No one cares you play the hottest songs in the morning, because they could get it a 
[01:07:30]  million other ways.  They could get it, right.  So if you're not playing that song, they're going to find it somewhere else immediately,  and they're all right with that.  You're never going to be able to compete with the fact that people could get songs like that.  I was walking to the comedy store the other night.  I have a mouthful of food.  I apologize.  And I wanted to hear...  What's the song I love?  Rusty Cage, but I wanted to hear the original.  Right.  I just downloaded it on McDougal Street, and I had it in one block.  That's all you got to do.  This is amazing.  Here we are in life.  Isn't it?  Yeah.  Instant gratification.  That's a guy out of touch if he's still selling the fact that they play the hottest 
[01:08:00]  songs in the morning.  When we do artist interviews, we keep it to the major core artists like Bruno Mars and  Katy Perry.  We keep the talk short and sweet, which means you have nothing to say.  Yeah.  Short and sweet.  Because if you've got something going on, it doesn't matter if you talk for a long  time, with strong sound nuggets.  Ew.  Sound nuggets.  And put the rest into our Toddcast.  The Toddcast.  And other audio and video offerings. 
[01:08:30]  Yuck.  It sounds like a podcast.  Yuck.  Yeah, it does sound like a podcast.  The reason why we are, you know, doing this is because this is radio.  This is regular radio.  Yeah, regular radio.  We obsess about this because this is just being done in every city in the country and  it's just horrible.  There is one thing I do like about this.  Yeah.  They ask him, you're on from 6 to 10 a.m.  Monday through Saturday.  Right. 
[01:09:00]  When do you all meet for show prep?  Right.  And what time do you arrive and when do you call it a day?  Right.  What's his answer?  The support staff.  And I think we should adopt this policy.  Absolutely.  What?  Yay!  The support staff arrives at 3.30 a.m.  That's what it says.  3.30.  So, you know, I think maybe you guys could start getting here at 3.30.  You're not going to finish that?  Just that part is what you want to instill?  Oh. 
[01:09:30]  And we have our first meeting.  I like that, too.  Right.  We have our first meeting at 5.20 a.m.  Oh, my God.  Do you think at the end of each other meeting they put their hands in the middle and they  all go, all right, guys, let's remember.  Keep it mediocre.  Break it.  We outline the entire show and then adjust on the fly if something takes off.  Takes off.  Which has the listeners.  See, for guys that want to try to make it in radio, because we get those tweets and emails 
[01:10:00]  all the time, do not outline your entire show.  Oh, God.  That is the worst thing you could do, because then you feel like you've got to stick to  that schedule.  Right.  You've got to be prepared.  We're prepared.  Yeah.  But we're very unorganized.  We do not have an outline.  We have a whole bunch of little things we could possibly go to.  But, like, yesterday, Ann decided to talk about tin knocking.  It came out of nowhere, and it was a great 40-minute segment.  But they wouldn't be able to do any of that, because they would be panicking that, like, 
[01:10:30]  oh, God, we have the funny song segment.  Right.  We can't not play it.  Right.  Because they're expecting the funny song segment.  And then Todd goes, I arrive between 4 and 4.30 a.m.  To do what?  Oh, my God.  When Todd is arriving, all full of piss and vinegar, I'm snoozing on me pillow.  Absolutely.  Sometimes you're doing the same thing when Todd is done for the day.  He goes, I arrive between 4 and 4.30, and they leave when the job is done. 
[01:11:00]  Oh, God.  What a pompous asshole.  Some days that's 11 a.m.  Other days it's 4 p.m.  What?  If the job is to suck, they should leave at 10 a.m.  You're just done.  We're done here.  That means you've got an extremely tired staff.  Yeah, yeah.  That is scared to leave early.  My normal day at the station goes well into the afternoon.  Oh, why?  Since I jump into the sales and promotional end of things when the show prep is done. 
[01:11:30]  So he, what does he put on his?  He takes meetings all day.  His sales hat.  He takes meetings all day.  He takes those meetings.  Walks around the hall.  He looks like a guy that loves a good meeting.  Let me step into the promotional office and see what's going on.  Hey, guys, what do we got today?  Let's sit down and discuss.  Same as yesterday, Todd.  Nothing.  Nothing.  They probably watch him come down and go, here he comes, here he comes. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, fuck.  Right.  Hope this goes quick.  Right.  Hey, what can we do to promote my show?  How about we just show a bunch of empty beehives because there's no buzz?  You described the Todd show as having a whole new vibe, sort of like reality TV on the radio.  What does that mean, first of all?  How does that work?  Well, he's going to explain it.  Uh-huh.  We can learn something here.  Thank goodness.  It's honest.  No one is playing a role here. 
[01:12:30]  Really?  You don't even use your real voice.  We like to say it's real life, real people, and real funny.  Wow.  It's none of those things.  No.  It's literally none of those things.  None.  There's no us and them.  If you're trying to be something you're not, people could smell it.  He did not say this.  He says, if you're trying to be something you're not, people could smell it a mile away.  Oh, yeah?  He does four prank phone calls a show that are fake. 
[01:13:00]  Right.  Yeah.  That are completely fake.  You're not allowed to do prank phone calls, especially on regular radio.  But he's keeping it real.  So how is that keeping it real?  And you don't think people could smell that a mile away, that they're all fake and set up?  You think he believes this?  Or do you think he knows?  He's like, oh, boy, am I fucking bullshitting this motherfucker.  Trying to get a pine tar ball past the batter.  People only get to know you if you're being you.  Oh, God. 
[01:13:30]  I don't know why I hate this guy.  I've never met him.  Yeah.  I've never met the guy.  We've heard he's not the nicest.  But I think he's just everything that's...  I feel he's everything that is wrong with this business.  He's every fucking PD that thought they had the plan for us.  He's hacky?  Oh, God, is he ever.  Or...  Oh, boy.  No defined roles.  Explain.  It's the SNL mentality.  Oh, this is...  He's comparing himself to SNL.  No, he's comparing himself to fucking... 
[01:14:00]  What's his name?  Lorne Michaels.  Lorne Michaels.  What?  Oh, yeah.  Like, look at this.  Oh, my God.  See?  Lorne Michaels.  Right?  So his...  So what?  He sits around and he kind of looks at his nails.  Right.  You know what I mean?  And it's like, all right, guys.  All right, come on in.  I'm ready.  Entertain me.  I'm ready for y'all.  Bring on the fool.  So he says, my team pitches me content and I have the final say as to what goes on.  So what is he, give a thumbs up or down?  Right.  They all know what's expected of them, which is everything. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, God.  Oh, man.  You think they're just running around trying to please Todd?  Of course they are.  If you're only worried about what you do, you're not seeing the whole field.  Opening up to make sure everyone knows every job makes it a lot tougher for things to fall  through the cracks.  Everyone knows every job.  Do you think he's got, like, the producer's got to know about sales and promotion and all  that shit and just making people stay much too late? 
[01:15:00]  I want to go home.  Just be a funny guy.  Right.  Instead of all this shit, just be funny.  Right.  And stop doing the fucking fake phony voice.  It stinks, dude.  Dang.  It's not funny.  It's fucking 2014.  That's an 80s thing.  It certainly is.  I want to keep going.  This is kind of good.  Please.  This is all I want to do today is read and reread this interview.  Yes.  How do you keep from walking all over each other?  We don't worry about it. 
[01:15:30]  There's a natural give and take that you just feel.  The same way you do at a dinner party.  The worst thing you can do is hire people and then tell them not to talk until you point  at them.  Oh, boy.  Uh-oh.  That sounds like something.  Someone got pointed at.  Sounds like maybe that was Scott's way.  Oh, was that...  But he's a little pussy boy and he's not brave enough to say that.  Yeah.  But it sounds like that's a Scott thing.  I'll point at you.  I'll point at you and then you talk.  And you talk right there.  Team Scott, though, boys and girls.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:16:00]  Are there occasions when it gets a little loud?  Absolutely.  Don't read the next line.  Don't read it.  Oh, no.  I can't hear it.  I can't hear it.  Oh, no.  But that's when the party gets better.  The party gets better.  Yeah.  By the way, what old lady says, the way you do at a dinner party.  A dinner party?  Who the fuck has a dinner party?  We like it to seem like a cotillion when we're in there.  You know, it's going great when the dead caretaker spills avocado all over your jacket. 
[01:16:30]  It's a dinner party.  There's a guy in a bunny rabbit outfit blowing someone else.  You know, you've really hit the nail on the head.  Per second.  Per second.  If you're trying to sound young and hip, you can't say dinner party.  Dinner party.  No, you don't.  That's crazy.  Wow.  That's good.  You want to meet the team?  You know what? 
[01:17:00]  There's a few things in here, though.  Meet the team.  Todd Pettengale.  Pettengale.  My name is on the door, which means it's my fault if we're late with spots in the men's room.  Yes.  And the douche store.  See, the jerk store was douche.  It's the original.  Douche store.  Then you got Monk.  He's the executive producer.  He's been there 16 years.  He's our sarcastic, troublemaking exec producer.  Look out.  Oh, troublemaking.  Look out.  He's a troublemaker.  He's never met an insult he wouldn't use. 
[01:17:30]  He wrote that.  He's never met an insult.  I never met an insult I wouldn't use.  Oh, yeah.  Too bad he didn't meet cunt-faced hack boss.  Who uses actors for his phony phone calls, but then says people can smell it if you're not being real.  A mile away.  Right.  Monk, watch out, guys.  Monk loves to stir the pot and create drama out of thin air.  Oh, God.  It's all this cliche shit. 
[01:18:00]  Well, we've never created drama out of thin air.  No.  Not out of thin air.  Absolutely.  Hands down, he's the best, most organized guy I've ever met.  He's my right hand, and I love him like a brother.  Hold on.  Our own Sam, now we have to say, let's say that question was asked of the Opie Anthony program.  Executive producer Sam has been here for nine years.  He's our sarcastic, troublemaking executive producer.  That would actually work. 
[01:18:30]  Yes, but I probably wouldn't say that.  He's never met an insult he wouldn't use.  You're a pussy when it comes to that stuff.  Yeah.  He likes others to do his bidding.  His dirty work.  You like to make it a little more vague.  Yeah.  He's never stepped in a pile of shit which he didn't resemble.  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  Unnecessary.  What?  You're the only necessary.  No.  No.  Oh, you're right here.  Sorry.  Yep.  Cooper.  Cooper's on the show, too.  I like Cooper.  And he describes him this way.  That's a her.  That's a her. 
[01:19:00]  Cooper Riding.  Oh, geez.  Sorry.  She's in her third year.  Cooper's the only team member with a PhD.  No.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Don't do it.  All right.  This is good stuff.  Good stuff.  This is good stuff.  He's putting a little funny in this interview.  I'll tell you that.  The rest of us have PhD knots.  What?  She has a PhD.  They have PhD knots.  Yeah.  What?  It doesn't even fit.  It doesn't work. 
[01:19:30]  No.  But she's a tough and honest native New Yorker.  She brings a wealth of experience to the show and a hefty dose of reason.  Which means PhDs nuts.  Right.  Right.  God damn it.  You're missing a very important part here.  Oh, shit.  She brings a wealth of experience to the show and a hefty dose of reason.  Which means she's the hole.  The hole.  Reason.  And then he writes, which I totally ignore.  Because it's a little edgy.  Look out.  This Todd guy's a little edgy.  You could try to put him in check.  Right.  But he's not. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, you could put up that yield sign.  But I ain't stopping.  He's not stopping.  Hell no.  For nobody.  So Monk stirs the pot.  Right.  Cooper tries to keep things between the lines.  But Todd, he won't have any of that.  It's a madhouse over there.  It's crazy.  Perfectly timed.  Perfectly on schedule.  Wow.  Did you meet Ann yet?  No, I have not.  Ann, he writes.  Or they call her Annie, you know.  Hey, Annie.  Is our new regular voice.  She's so perfectly balanced.  So honest to a fault.  And talks about things you'd think of, but never say. 
[01:20:30]  Oh, boy.  She has no filter.  Would it be funny if Annie.  Dropping in bombs.  But if she really was like that.  And he's like, so what did you do this weekend?  And they're all like, well, I hung out.  And she's like, I took a little black cock on Easter.  Oh, girl, you can't tell.  I may ask her anything.  You can't say that.  You got to pull back a little.  She's crazy.  Oh, boy.  So she has no filter, which is a challenge for me, but I love it. 
[01:21:00]  It's 8.30 p.m.  I'm going to let you guys go home early.  Right.  She doesn't have a filter.  I say, how you doing this morning?  And she says, not good.  I'm on this dog shit program.  I'm like, put a filter in place.  You can't teach this, just be you, is what I told her.  Oh, you can't teach this, just be you.  Gotcha, okay. 
[01:21:30]  You can't teach this, just be you, is what I told her.  I got it, okay.  She surprises me every day with her candor.  I look forward to getting her reaction to things on the air.  They are always oddly, lovingly, unpredictable.  Look out.  We didn't hear any of that shit.  Not a peep of it.  We don't hear anything.  No.  They all just quickly talk because they know they have to get spots  and songs in.  Of course.  It's the important part.  All right. 
[01:22:00]  Is there anything else?  You missed the part where they do Todd?  Oh, we said Toddcasts.  Tell us about the use of social media.  Oh, yeah.  Sheila Watko directs the show.  Okay, that's boring.  I just like the image of him sitting there while he calls in the staff to entertain him  so he could hear something that, you know, he deems a nugget that could get on the air.  And what's the staff saying?  I was thinking today at 7.05 we'd do one of your fake prank calls.  I like that.  No, they do something else at 7.05. 
[01:22:30]  It's in the article, Sam.  Oh, sorry.  I didn't do my homework.  It looks like you're getting some traditional contesting and marketing, too.  Traditional contesting.  Oh, traditional.  Traditional.  You know, you said it right, but I'm like, what a hack way to add.  That's just hack.  Yes, every weekday at 7.05 a.m. we give the Friends with Benefits cash code.  Friends with Benefits cash code.  Who the fuck is writing down the cash code?  Well, if you're a friend.  It's contest pigs.  Of course it is.  Radio has what's called contest pigs. 
[01:23:00]  Yep.  And for some reason, regular radio still caters to those people.  Everyone else, most people don't ever fucking call to try to win something on the radio.  It's a known fact.  Yeah.  But the contest pigs, they got it all set up and they win over and over and over again.  Because not many people actually, you know, try to win these things.  Later that morning, we asked them to call.  95th caller, of course.  95th caller.  They win a thousand bucks.  Then they get one call to a friend and give them an additional 500 bucks. 
[01:23:30]  That's the friend with benefits.  $1,500 a day for eight straight weeks.  Oh, I get it.  Instead of dick, you get money.  But someone stole the Friends with Benefits money.  I wonder who it could be.  See, it's fugitive.  You know how great it would be if Todd did a fugitive bit?  Oh, stop.  He wouldn't.  All things came together.  If he wanted, if he enjoyed us mocking him, he would do it.  That's the only way. 
[01:24:00]  You mentioned that you personally are on the streets all the time.  He is?  He's in there from fucking 4 a.m. until 11 at night.  Yeah.  It's crazy.  Are we having a radio flashback?  The interviewer asks.  Oh.  Hardly anyone does this to any great degree anymore.  Please explain why this is important to you.  To be at up to two or more local fundraisers a weekend.  Oh, is that what he's doing to try to get a buzz?  Try to get his name out there? 
[01:24:30]  Fundraisers.  What is this radio genius sleep?  My God.  Oh, my God.  The listeners have choices, especially in New York, where there are literally hundreds  of signals.  Wouldn't you rather listen to someone who cares about you and your event?  No.  Please don't.  Exactly.  I'd rather listen to someone that makes me laugh.  Right?  Exactly.  It's entertaining.  In the end, if you're making people laugh or making them think or entertaining them  in general, yes, of course, you got them.  We can move along.  I'd say don't go with the next line.  Don't read that.  It's not worth hearing. 
[01:25:00]  No.  No.  Oh, God.  I can't.  I don't think you should read it.  It's terrible.  We get too caught up in the feel and not in the real.  Caught up in the feel?  What?  Let me read it properly.  We get too caught up in the feel and not in the real.  Well, what is that?  What does he mean by that?  I don't know.  What's the feel?  It rhymes.  It does rhyme.  I'll tell you right the fuck now.  Yeah.  T-shirts on the way.  Oh, God.  T-shirts on the way. 
[01:25:30]  That is a good one.  Caught up in the feel and not in the real.  Not in the real.  In my horrible font.  I don't get it.  I don't get it.  You want to talk about voicemail?  I don't know.  What else should we do here?  We're almost to the end.  Let's just keep going.  You sure?  Wonderful.  Let the records show that Jimmy wants to continue.  Jim Norton's enjoying it.  So you could direct all your hate that this wasn't working towards Jim Norton today.  I love it.  Because I was ready to tap out.  Actually, no way.  This is too good.  I love it.  You spoke about a voicemail line. 
[01:26:00]  So you encouraged the audience to invite you out.  Also, explain about wanting to do a WPLJ summer tour with the morning show to do the show on remote.  And then even attend block parties.  Oh, you gotta love a good block party.  It started as another way for the audience to communicate with us.  They have to know we hear them and care what they think.  I care what they think.  Because we do.  They help drive the content on the show. 
[01:26:30]  If we get several voicemails about the same topic, it tells us we should be devoting more time to it.  Several voicemails?  About what topic?  What topic are they calling?  More phony phone calls.  Hey, the Malaysian air thing?  Yeah.  I don't know.  But you might want to talk about that.  Okay, bye, Todd.  Okay.  I know you care about what I think, so.  Tom, I don't know if you're watching TV, but there was a plane crash somewhere off Australia. 
[01:27:00]  You might want to talk about it.  Thank you, Todd.  Thanks for hearing me out.  That's two.  I guess we should talk about that.  Talk about it.  What is he talking about?  Wow.  It's also an amazing way to let people get the word out about charity events and shout-outs.  And yes, we're planning to be out at about all summer long.  Wow.  We will know what we're planning on doing all summer long?  Huh?  Taking a shitload of time off.  Oh, yeah.  Pool side, motherfucker. 
[01:27:30]  And you let us know who's doing better.  Yes.  Friday's off, right around the corner, boys and girls.  Batten down the hatches.  But they're going to be out there all summer long.  They're going to be out there at block parties.  We will solicit listeners to nominate their neighborhoods to have us come out to visit.  Yeah.  Good stuff.  Oh, God.  You want to go, Jimmy?  Still?  Yeah.  What's the next question? 
[01:28:00]  Expond on your feelings about giving back to the public.  You commented that radio has a responsibility to give back to the public.  Does it?  No, you have a responsibility to be entertaining.  That's it.  That is all this is about.  Paying it.  Radio has a responsibility to give back to the public, not serve our egos, but help the community by showing up to make a difference.  That's not true.  It's a lie.  We hear from people all the time.  If we get someone writing and saying, hey, man, you make my commute a little easier, that's all you're trying to do here in the end. 
[01:28:30]  And if you help out a charity here and there, sure, we do that.  But it doesn't have to.  No.  You're just trying to hide the fact that you're not entertaining when these dumb microphones are on.  Paying it forward shouldn't be something you say.  It should be something you do.  I have a responsibility to lead my example.  Oh, God.  What a self-inflated fucking sense of self-worth. 
[01:29:00]  And what he should say is the same way Johnny from the Jerky Boys led by example for me.  And I took the voice.  Thief.  And then he goes, it's how we collectively as a show have decided to say thank you for listening.  Oh, God.  Getting involved in the community with our listeners is as much fun for us as it is for them.  So that means there's no fun for anyone.  Right.  None fun.  I learned more from them being at those events than I could from reading about it. 
[01:29:30]  Oh, God.  This is all fucking bullshit.  No, it's not because he says.  The listeners don't care to this point.  No.  No.  That's true.  Play the hot songs, give me the dumb traffic, the weather, and hopefully say something funny every once in a while.  That's it.  He doesn't believe this stuff he's saying.  I think he does.  You can't.  Well.  No, he knows this is exactly what you say to make it sound like you're involved.  You missed the next line.  Oh, yeah.  The thing is, it has to be genuine. 
[01:30:00]  Oh.  If you're doing it because you think you have to, you've already missed the point.  I guess I missed the point.  It's a grassroots, small market approach that works everywhere, even in the world's biggest market in New York.  Ah, there you go.  Shit.  Yeah.  Why do you think you have an advantage as a live and local show over others?  Okay.  All right.  Maybe he can explain it.  Because we're officially competing with the Todd show.  Time to learn.  Let's learn.  We want to get a lot of New York ears. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  And we're doing it very different than Todd.  We could talk about the things that directly impact our listeners.  If someone in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, or Long Island cares about it, then we can discuss it.  Ah.  I doubt they care about a woman who made the best bowl of soup in Los Angeles.  Oh.  But do they, so they care about someone who made the best bowl of soup in Patchogue?  No one gives a shit about the bowl of soup.  This, about the soup.  This passive aggressive cunt.  Yeah.  Is going back to the Scott Shannon thing from earlier. 
[01:31:00]  What?  Really?  Yes.  This is the knuckleheads in the news thing.  Oh.  So that was a little shot at Scott Shannon.  Weird news.  I guess he was.  But I guess he.  But, of course, he gets the worst example to really make the bit sound horrendous.  Because no one wants to hear about the best soup in Los Angeles.  I doubt they actually did that.  Even in Los Angeles, they don't want to hear about that.  Right.  It's a bad example.  No, but he's saying we're going to talk like we have real things to discuss here.  Where Scott Shannon, but he didn't have the balls to say it, was the guy that cared more about the best soup in Los Angeles. 
[01:31:30]  That's how that should have read.  I think you're right.  You said something earlier.  The days of coasting are over.  Time for radio to dig in.  Tell me more.  Oh, he said that?  There's never been more competition than right now.  That's his answer to that.  Uh-huh.  That's it.  Oh, that's it?  Mm-hmm.  That's all you get.  Oh, here you go.  How do you feel about other music services?  Pandora, Spotify, iTunes,  Radio, iHeart, which Cumulus works, which Cumulus works with, or even Cumulus own, uh, RDIO. 
[01:32:00]  Clearly, they have their place, but I'm a radio guy, and I still believe there's nothing like live and local content.  I'm aware of them and spend some time with them, and they are great if you want a jukebox, but that's not radio.  He's a jukebox.  That's the type of show he fucking does.  He's in the way of the songs, period.  No local flavor.  It's why we have to do a better job of painting the picture filled with local references to local landmarks and local events. 
[01:32:30]  Fucking asshole.  No one gives a fuck.  It's been proven wrong a million times by guys that just do a good radio show.  Hey, look, it's the Empire State Building.  We'll be back.  What the fuck?  It's so stupid.  Who cares?  Loaded with local references.  And local landmarks.  What a jizz bag.  There's nothing worse than local references.  Hey, it's a new one from Katy Perry.  Look, St. Patrick's Cathedral. 
[01:33:00]  Hey, look, Mrs. B's needle made a pie.  I'm on 8th Avenue.  Oh, fuck your mother.  This is annoying.  This is what these people really think.  Does he stink on ice?  Local.  What makes radio the most fun for you?  Oh, that's good.  Radio is still the greatest medium on the planet.  There's nothing like doing it live and painting a mental picture.  That's what he likes about radio. 
[01:33:30]  What would you like to change about radio today?  Okay.  Uh-oh.  I think at this point, our audience knows what we would like to change about radio.  Yes, we'd like to have his microphones to have old dynamite in them.  Leaky old sweating dynamite.  Like a good stick of sweaty dynamite.  Oh, my God, yeah.  Oh, look out.  First time he does that shitty voice, it fucking reverberates and blows his head off.  Yeah.  This is what he would like to change about radio. 
[01:34:00]  I love this.  Two things.  I'd like to see radio stop attacking itself.  Uh-oh.  What does that mean?  A broadcast radio needs to stay united and see the whole field.  Second, develop a farm system again.  Syndication has taken the place of cultivating talent.  Well, syndication took off because there just wasn't enough talented people doing radio.  In the local markets, right?  Period.  Yeah.  And then you had consultants and PDs that, you know, if someone was talented, they kept them down anyway.  I love this part.  It would be nice for younger broadcasters to have the experience of taking transmitter readings, 
[01:34:30]  emptying the garbage pails, and turning off the lights after the national anthem.  Sam Roberts.  I'm sorry.  I think it's time you fucking empty some garbage pails and take some meter readings, even though we don't have, like, a transmitter, per se.  Let me tell you about meter readings.  Something, wow, I forgot all about.  Yeah.  I think we were still doing it in Boston, right?  Yeah.  Not NAW, though, right? 
[01:35:00]  Uh-huh.  We just made it up.  Yeah, you just made them up.  We just made it up.  You pretty much wrote the thing that was in the last post in the book and just kept it going.  Right.  Let it ride.  You knew it had to be between this number and that number.  So every day, like, hey, you know what?  Let's put a five here today.  Just change it up a little like that.  Fuck.  No one took meter readings seriously.  It actually was an FCC thing, I guess, for a while.  So he wants young broadcasters to have the experience of taking the transmitter readings, emptying the garbage pails, and what's turning off the lights after the national anthem? 
[01:35:30]  That's like when the station's done for the day.  Oh!  We've now concluded our broadcast day.  Oh, that.  Oh, okay.  Small town radio was the absolute best training ground.  And Sam just fucking waltzed in here with his fucking olive oil voice and guinea charm.  Yeah, with his kinky hair.  He's right.  Everything that I've had to learn, I learned from Scorch in Syracuse.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:36:00]  Do your dressing.  That's right.  All right.  Anything else you'd like to add?  What a favor.  He babbles here, but then he just says, I love all my morning show peeps, and coming to work is fun again.  Fun again.  Ah, you know what that means.  If he hates Scott, just say it all.  I see what's going on here.  How'd I miss?  Team Scott's kicking your ass so far.  Make sure you listen to Scott Shannon if you have one of those people meters.  We're allowed to say that because we're not on a regular radio. 
[01:36:30]  So even though you're not listening, just tune that people meter into CBS FM and then listen to us, and then Scott will get the credit.  He's doing very well.  And I think we have a little to do with that.  Putting a smile on their faces and letting them know we're here and in it with them.  It's the coolest damn way to make a living.  No, it's not.  Getting your dick sucked while somebody films it is the coolest way to make a living.  That's a good one.  And then he's got an action-packed picture right there where he's all young and jumping in the air.  They're all jumping.  Some karate kicks.  How's it going to be with a cliff behind them? 
[01:37:00]  They're all jumping, although the chubby one still has his right foot on the ground.  Yeah, that's true.  Oh, you're awkward.  And you forgot the bonus questions.  What's wrong with you people?  Oh, what happened?  I laughed all through them.  I couldn't get through them.  Oh, okay.  Bonus question number one.  We're just about done.  Don't worry.  Hang in there, guys.  Peanut butter.  Chunky or plain?  Oh, not these.  And now if he had any sense of humor, he would have said it depends on what the dog prefers. 
[01:37:30]  Ah, yes.  See?  Or answer with who gives a shit.  And then bonus question number two.  Brussels sprouts or cauliflower?  Mm-hmm.  And then he gets a little crazy with his answer.  He says, I prefer M&Ms.  Why?  What does that mean?  It means that he won't answer that.  He's thinking out of the box, Ant.  That's what he does.  He should have said I prefer asparagus because it makes my urine smell good.  And then I give girls golden showers around the station.  I would listen to that show. 
[01:38:00]  Ah, yes.  I make him smell my asparagus piss.  He's the worst.  Terrible.  It's terrible.  What is Todd's voicemail?  Maybe we should call him.  Just to make suggestions on topics.  Yeah, that's true.  Okay, bye, Todd.  All right, thank you.  Oh, God, that's funny.  You brought that to our attention. 
[01:38:30]  That's a great one, Ant.  I read that last night.  I was glued to it.  It was a real page-turner.  And I had to post it.  And a lot of other people read it and commented on Twitter.  Were they supportive of his interview?  Not in the least.  How did you miss the garbage can?  I know.  I ripped the copy in half there.  And then I went to throw it in the garbage pail.  Which is three feet away.  I even leaned over.  It's probably a foot and a half away from my hand.  And it just, funk, hit the rim and fell on the floor. 
[01:39:00]  I could not get it in the garbage pail.  I missed half this.  But I hope Sam Roberts will be, you know, taking out the garbage.  Absolutely.  Shutting the lights off after the national anthem.  Fuck, it's 1950.  I do have to say one thing.  When we were at AF, and to some extent NEW, it was still cool to hang out at a radio station.  Oh yeah.  The atmosphere was such.  Right.  Especially after 5 o'clock when the suits went home.  A lot of camaraderie. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  It was definitely a cool place to be.  And you definitely got a lot of material for your radio show.  Just by hanging out and fooling around a little bit.  The entire building was fixated on a single goal.  Right.  To be successful.  Right.  And bring the station to number one.  Right.  But I swear to you, the worst thing you could do as a young broadcaster is hang around a radio station.  Yeah.  It's horrendous.  You could find a Denny Falcone to maybe get some knowledge from.  It's a horrendous place to be creatively. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah.  And there's always the suit just kind of hovering that is going to say no to every idea you come up with.  Yeah.  So the best thing you can do is get the fuck out as soon as your show's over.  Mm-hmm.  And no offense to SiriusXM.  It's like this everywhere.  And I don't know what's going to change that.  I learned a lot more, you know, pounding the pavement outside the building.  There you go.  I'll tell you that much.  That's right.  You got lawyers around radio stations now.  You got human resource people around now. 
[01:40:30]  We should just have naked women in our office because we could.  Oh, my God.  After the show, we would just hang, have a beer or two.  That's crazy.  And girls would come in and just get naked.  Yeah.  You would get fired immediately if they knew that was going to happen.  Did you hear a similar story?  I guess the guy that runs the Blue Angels out there in California.  Right.  He runs the base.  Right.  He just got thrown out because he fostered an environment of, like, sexual harassment 
[01:41:00]  through, like, jokes.  People were telling off-color jokes about chicks and tits and fucking and things like that.  It's the Blue Angels.  Right.  These guys, you know, putting their lives on the line.  They fly, what, 400 miles an hour an inch away from?  Fucking 800, 900.  Is it 800, 900?  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  See, I don't even know.  Over, you know, the speed of sound.  And they're an inch away from each other.  Yeah.  And then they can't just tell, like, a fucking... 
[01:41:30]  An off-color joke?  Off-color joke because people are sensitive around the base.  So he gets thrown out.  It's just another one of the situations where it's not like it used to be.  And I think that, especially in the military, is very important because you get that sense  of camaraderie.  Right.  You've got to do it.  I don't think...  I honestly don't think the bitches should be in some branches and some aspects of the 
[01:42:00]  military.  It's just me, though.  I think they should be there, but they should have to just do the same stuff physically.  That's all.  I don't mind that because there's some tough women out there.  Men and women are very different.  They're very different.  Let's fucking agree to that.  Don't say that's the premise of all my jokes.  No.  Men and women are very, very different.  And I think the military has been made over the years to work well with men in it.  And men need to, especially in life or death situations, for morale and other purposes, 
[01:42:30]  need to be able to communicate with each other in the way that men do.  And sometimes that is humor and off-color and gallows humor and things like that.  To bring in women into that environment changes the whole fucking environment.  Why are they such pussies about it?  Yeah, right?  Buck up, slit.  If you're going into these type of professions, you would think they would man up.  Right.  Man up. 
[01:43:00]  Man up and enjoy a good dick joke.  Jesus.  Although Israel does that.  Israel uses men and women, and they have a pretty tough army.  They do.  Their bitches are different, though.  I think bitches are fucking prima donnas.  See, now if we had a hole on the show.  Now, now.  Oh, now, now.  Now, now.  Not all of us.  Oh, come on, guys.  Clam up, clam.  I'm very excited, because Michael Imperioli saw the end of The Sopranos my way.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.

Yeah, that's a good one.  I like that story.  She don't give a fuck.  Cool for her.  And we'll explain that next.  Also, a little later today.  Wow, not even later at this point.  Anthony Bourdain's going to be here soon.  Yeah.  And a little later today, Sebastian Bach from Skid Row fame.  And we'll be checking our voicemail to find out what we'll be talking about next.

[01:51:00]  Oh, Jesus Christ.  What the fuck is he doing here?  Oh my God, please.  He didn't...  Oh no!  All right, I know what the fuck he did.  I know what the fuck he did.  My heart just stopped.  Yes, and it should.  It's very obvious he has no clue, and I'm off the hook.  I just surprised people out of nowhere.  It turns into Baby Diaper Mustache Day.  Today happens to be one of those days, and the odds of it actually happening are slim.  But when we saw your face at the door, I'm like, oh my fucking God.  Yeah, because he's somebody that would have been listening. 
[01:51:30]  Because you would have stopped by with the baby, too, before.  The bottom line is, you would take baby shit and put it under here?  Yeah.  Get the hell out of here.  You'd make a little mustache with baby shit.  Oh!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  It's green!  Fuck my audition!  Fuck you!  Fuck it, it's green!  You set me up!  Oh, it's fucking green!  Oh, Bobby's puking! 
[01:52:00]  Bobby's puking!  Get him a pail!  Oh, shit, get him a pail!  I don't care!  I'll fucking puke!  I want to see it on his lap!  Fuck all of you!  Bobby can't take it!

What's wrong with her?  He can handle the diaper.  I want to just fiddle through this myself. 
[01:52:30]  Let's go.  Let's make a nice Yosemite sand.  Holy shit!  I just got my first whip!  Oh, oh.  Dude, disgusting.  You gotta bring it...  All right, open up the diaper.  Let's see what's in there.  Oh, my God!  Oh, Bobby, look!  It looks like...  It looks like he ate...  Oh, God!  Oh!  Fuck, it's like dinting more beef stew!  Do it!  Ladies and gentlemen, this is called Baby Diaper Mustache. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, oh!  Oh, B!  Oh!  Oh, no!  Oh, my God, no!  Oh, no!  Oh, no!  Oh, get it off!  He fell on the floor!  He fell on the floor! 
[01:53:30]  He did it!  He took two fingers, wiped it right under his nose.  Now he can't get the smell out of his head.  Where is he?  He's going...  Oh, no, he's running off to the bathroom.  Holy shit!  It's time for another...  ...Adventures with Alex Jones!  ...Adventures with Alex Jones!  Today, Alex goes to space.

[01:54:30]  Finster, everybody thought Finster was a baby, but Finster was actually, uh, the, the crook,  the mastermind, uh, uh, Bugs Bunny couldn't even really deal with Finster, baby.  He just spilled the beans.  It's, uh, obviously a Manchurian candidate type of situation.  False flag operation.  Golf of Tonkin.  That's all for this week, kids.

[01:55:30]  Nice.  Oh, yeah.  This is the one, um, Jimmy just downloaded outside the comedy cellar.  Oh.  Don't forget, Jim Norton's gonna be at Caroline's tonight.  Starting his run at Caroline's.  Right through Sunday, yeah.  2-1-2-7-5-7-4-1-100 for tickets.  Yeah, I was, I was just walking, and I, and I, like, you know, sometimes your iPhone will,  uh, give you, like, the whole playlist, even though you don't have those songs on your phone.  And there's a little cloud outline, you can just download it from iTunes.  That was, I don't know why that, that page was up. 
[01:56:00]  But I'm like, I want to hear this.  I just, that was so, what a great time we live in.  Can you be a little more local, though, please?  Yeah, I was on McDougal.  Oh, thank you.  And I'm looking at old, uh, old Joey Smitter's place.  You know the one.  Sure.  Sells shoe polish.  Kiss!  It really is amazing to just pull a fucking song out of the air.  That's great.  That's honestly what you're doing.  It's, it's, it's, you used to have to physically buy an album. 
[01:56:30]  So.  Go home, play it on the record player.  And you just pull the song out of thin fucking air.  Thin air.  So how does it work?  All these songs are just around us?  They're right there.  Where?  Point in the air.  Where?  It's right there.  Where?  Right there.  There's another song there.  Look at that.  There's a song right there.  Where's Jethro Tull?  All this digital information.  Is it over there?  Flying.  You just, no, you just pointed at a fucking encyclopedia.  Oh.  Like, yeah.  Oops.  That's pointing at a movie.  There's, all this information is just flying around in little fucking electronic pulses. 
[01:57:00]  Our lifetime is one of the weird ones, I think.  It's strange in between.  We come from a place.  No cell phones.  Analog.  No internet.  We were analog peoples.  Three to four TV channels, and now all this, a mere few decades later.  It's crazy.  It's, the guy was, someone was talking to me yesterday about how they're inventing, or  they already have some, where you can, you can, into the fabric of clothes, and in paint,  you, they have these micro things, but eventually that's how the internet will work, and they 
[01:57:30]  see you'll almost be immersed in it, or it'll just be all around you.  It's a really, like, not like we know it, but, like, you'll be able to just, like, you  know, the wall will be online, and hardwired online, and if Anthony's in fucking Long Island  and you want to talk to him, just, like, open up, it's like you'll be standing in front  of each other.  Oh, that's pretty cool.  Wow, cool.  Kaku has said something like that, too.  But what if you're jerking off?  I mean, what if?  I would only do it if I was.  That's the scary part.  Right.  I think we're going to be seeing each other jerking off soon enough. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what we haven't.  I was, when I was, when I was driving home yesterday, and I've thought of this a few times,  the amazing times we live in.  Remember rusted cars?  You don't fucking see rusty cars anymore.  Wow.  People that drive around, and you'd see, like, the top of the fender is just rusted, and  the bottom.  Driving around where, though?  Anywhere.  Really?  Like the expressway?  Oh, okay.  Phew.  Yeah.  You almost didn't go local there.  That scared me.  Oh, I gotta go local.  Right.  The Long Island Expressway. 
[01:58:30]  Oh, okay.  Right.  That's right.  Yeah.  See, now everyone out there can relate to rusty cars.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  When, you know, when I was passing by the Van Wyke and the Grand Central entrance there by  the fairgrounds.  Yeah, yeah.  You would see a rusted car.  You realize they figured out that rust thing, and you don't see rusty cars anymore.  You just have to fucking, when you went to buy a car, it was like, ah, let me ding, ding,  ding, tap under there.  What is that? 
[01:59:00]  Right.  You got some Bondo on this fucking thing?  Was it rusting out?  Well, obviously, this car was in a snow climate.  Look at all the damage.  It might be that true coat they got on there, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Well, he's never done this before.  He's willing to knock $100 off that true coat.  Oh, it's more.  Never done this before.  Fucking liar.  Well, he's never done this before.  The debris was not from the plane, just like we said yesterday.  Of course not.  The plane's gone.  The debris that washed up on the shore off of Australia is not from the plane. 
[01:59:30]  They were very excited, and then they started thinking, oh, boy, just more garbage from the ocean.  Somewhere at the bottom of the cold, pitch black ocean, someone is strapped in a seat with their hair gently going,  whoosh.  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  Whoosh.  No lips left.  No eyelids left, because the little fish are going,  You think the plane's intact? 
[02:00:00]  Or a big piece of it?  I would think if, not intact, but little pieces of it, but I think a lot of it just fucking submerged.  It's so far out there that it sank before it reached land.  A lot of times if debris washes up, it's because they crashed a little closer to land.  Right.  Even the Air France plane that went down, they started getting debris.  It took two years to find the black boxes and the actual wreckage, but they started getting debris washing up, 
[02:00:30]  and they knew the plane.  You know, they had known the plane went down.  This one, I think it's so deep, and it took so long for them to even figure out where they wanted to start searching,  that that shit's just, it's sunk.  Wow.  Busted apart.  Fucking, it's just gone.  If it's a suicide, and he killed everyone first, he might have come, they said he flew below 5,000 feet to avoid radar.  He may have hit the ocean, he may have brought the plane very, very, very low right before it hit,  because this way it just kind of hits. 
[02:01:00]  Not much debris.  Not a gigantic, yeah, just, and the plane is not as broken up, and then it just kind of sinks home.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  Jesus.  That's why I just, that person and the people just strapped in their seat.  Right.  Whoosh, whoosh.  Looking like fucking old Ben Gardner.  All right.  Tops are ruined.  Yes.  Michael Imperioli thinks this is what happened on the final episode of The Sopranos. 
[02:01:30]  He finally, he's finally talking about it.  That shows me off the air, seven years.  Are you kidding?  2007.  Holy shit.  My opinion is that we were in Tony's point of view in the last moments of his life.  Yeah.  And that's it.  He's not expecting it.  It comes out of nowhere.  And if you were shot, if someone assassinated you, I don't know, basically everything would go black.  And David was putting us in those shoes at that time.  I think that's about it.  I always thought that. 
[02:02:00]  A lot of people think that.  Why end it like that?  Huh?  David Chase said no.  He's a lion sack.  He just wants everyone to keep guessing.  Yeah.  Because if he lived, you know, why end it like that?  Right.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I like that.  I like that theory.  Seven fucking years.  And then what's the Joan Rivers all about?  Well, she was a comedian.  I don't feel like reading this now.  It's too long.  Read words.  She's going to joke about it. 
[02:02:30]  It's too long.  Let's just talk about it.  What happened?  The Cleveland girls.  Right.  The decapitive girl.  I don't know what the joke was.  Remember the girls that were kept in what they called the House of Horrors by that gentleman  who later killed himself in jail?  Yeah.  Kept them locked up in there for years and years, and they finally escaped.  Guess what?  Joan Rivers has no sympathy for the women locked in Ariel Castro's Cleveland House of Horrors.  House of Horrors.  That's right.  House of Horrors.  One day after Rivers compared on the Today Show, her daughter's cushy Malibu guest room 
[02:03:00]  to the three women's decade-long plight.  It's hilarious, though.  That's a funny joke.  I guess the joke was, those women in the basement in Cleveland had more space.  Jesus.  When you're trying to make it sound like you're staying in a small room or something, that's  a funny example to use, because it's so outrageous, and it really conjures up an image.  It's funny.  Joan Rivers is a great example of, don't apologize for anything, and everything will be fine. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah.  Because she's gotten herself in a lot of, not a lot of trouble, but she's had a lot of heat  in the last few years, and they continue to book her on all the big shows, the big mainstream  shows, so nothing has happened with her career.  She's one of the untouchables, I think, out there.  But you just stay strong, and it's not us that have to stay strong, the artists or whatever,  the broadcasters.  It's the people that control these entities.  They're the ones that have to stay strong and stand behind their people.  Because Joan Rivers is a perfect example. 
[02:04:00]  In the end, nothing happens to you.  This is the actual joke?  Yes.  Okay.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Joan, you were just complaining when we were on the couch a few minutes ago that there's  not enough business being done on Saturday nights for your show.  We're here to drum that up.  Thank you very much.  What is it like living under the same roof as your daughter?  Why would you two do this?  Well, four years later, we're like, you know, everyone's kind of going, mm.  Yeah, but I'm still in the same stupid little room.  I mean, those women in the basement in Cleveland had more space. 
[02:04:30]  I mean, it is just the worst.  The worst.  No one's wild family.  Too soon?  Well, thanks.  Well, thanks.  You be the judge.  Pause.  See how scared everybody gets?  They are petrified.  But they do know the environment that they're in.  But look, they shut the ep up and they have nothing to say about it.  Isn't it amazing how quickly people know now not to laugh or like that?  Uh-oh, that's trouble. 
[02:05:00]  Oh, no, that's bad.  Like it used to be someone would say something off color and the hosts would laugh and then  maybe giving some thought to it, you'd be like, oh, boy, I think we're going to catch  shit for that.  But now everyone's just on their guard walking on eggshells.  I'm walking on eggshells.  Whoa.  Whoa.  And you know, like, ah, ah, they're going to come after me.  Sorry, state of affairs.  Do you think Joan Rivers is bummed that Melissa doesn't have one funny bone in her body?  Boy, she didn't get it. 
[02:05:30]  Do you think that bothers Joan Rivers when she puts her pillow, puts her head on the pillow  at night?  She got her humor from Edgar.  She doesn't have one, not one tiny funny bone in her body.  How does that happen?  Not like mommy.  Mommy is very, very funny.  Uh, go ahead.  Mmm.  Tell me.  Is that why you were knocking the wall down?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  There's no room.  But it was, it never intended to be a residence. 
[02:06:00]  It's my guest room.  And then get back on track.  Al got him back on track.  Yeah.  Um, and then on TMZ later, she said they got to live rent free for more than a decade.  Jesus.  God damn.  That's funny.  She's 80, man.  She don't give a fuck.  And then the lawyers for the girls put out a statement.  It's shut the fuck up.  She had an interview with the Cleveland plane dealer. 
[02:06:30]  Wake up, Cleveland.  Going local.  Going local right there.  Going local for Cleveland right now.  Cleveland.  Wake up.  Yeah.  Uh, I'm a comedian.  She said.  I know what those girls went through.  It was a little stupid joke.  There's nothing to apologize for.  I made a joke.  That's what I do.  Calm down.  Calm fucking down.  Right.  I'm a comedian.  They're free.  So let's move on.  Beautiful.  That's all you need to say.  Yep.  I'm a comedian making a few jokes.  But she did, you know, but she did care about their plight. 
[02:07:00]  It's a fucking story.  And guess what?  Most people know about.  It's a great reference point for a comedian.  Right.  And you don't have to care about their plight if you want to make jokes.  No.  But other people care about it.  Wow.  And the lawyer's statement, you know, to be so hurtful.  Hurtful.  Oh, here it is.  You're right.  Shocking and disappointing.  Our clients have become aware of Joan Rivers' unfortunate comparison of living in her daughter's guest room to their captivity. 
[02:07:30]  It's a comparison because it's a joke.  Right.  Put it in that context.  The way he said the unfortunate comparison, like she was just making a statement.  A statement with a ha-ha at the end.  Right.  No, it was a joke.  Using the comparison as a punchline of a joke.  Is way different.  We understand that Miss Rivers is a comedian.  However, the idea that a celebrity would say something this hurtful on national TV, no less, is beyond shocking and disappointing. 
[02:08:00]  Meaning, our clients are strong private women who have endured unwanted and often painful media attention for quite some time.  Yeah.  They now have to endure this, which is a new low.  And we believe a sincere apology is warranted.  You're not going to get it from us.  Oh, we believe a sincere apology.  Why wouldn't he just say, well, you know, it wasn't the nicest thing, but she can say what she wants.  Yeah.  Who cares?  She's making jokes.  And this just gets Joan Rivers fired up because she doesn't stop.  Most celebrities, when they get a little heat, they'll, like, kind of go, Wang, all right, well, I'm not going to apologize, but I'm going to go. 
[02:08:30]  But Joan Rivers kept going.  She told TMZ that these women are practically celebrities.  One of them has a book deal.  Neither are in a psych ward.  They're okay, she said.  I bet you within three years, one of them will be on Dancing with the Stars.  She's great.  But she's right.  Ern Andrews was on Dancing with the Stars, right?  Who's that?  Yeah, I think, yeah.  She was the one that got peeped. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, right.  And the only reason she was on Dancing with the Stars was because she got peeped.  I'm telling you right now.  She was a celebrity, but that peeping made her a much bigger name, and that led to Dancing with the Stars.  So Joan Rivers is absolutely correct.  Yeah.  There's a very good possibility something like that would happen to one of the women eventually.  Yeah.  And they had a brutal decade of, I mean, that was a brutal beatings.  I mean, he was a terrible, it's unfortunate he killed himself.  That somebody didn't get to cut his throat.  Right.  Wow.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:09:30]  He's a piece of shit, of course.  Is it like that?  Oh.  Hey, a spider laid eggs on my teeth.  April falls.  No.  Let me see, then.  I knocked him off.  Got to trip up Edgar every so often.  Edgar.  They're trying to find the swatting guy.  They called in the SWAT team.  Oh, right.  He was a little angry.  I guess the SWAT team calls it in itself, but this guy made it sound like there was a situation, 
[02:10:00]  so the SWAT team got involved, and it's called SWATing.  We did this story yesterday.  They're trying to find that, the person that called in or started this problem.  They brought in the FBI.  Seventy heavily armed officers to the home of a teen who had just defeated him in an online game of Call of Duty.  Wow.  They'll find that guy, right?  I hope so.  Because if the guy's just, they can check who won what game.  Yeah, they'll find him.  I think they'll find him. 
[02:10:30]  What a cunt, though.  He loses a game of Call of Duty, and he tries to get someone in trouble.  Oh, just sit there and yell and scream and yell racial epithets at your TV.  You don't do things like that when you lose.  Oh, boy.  Do I get angry?  Because I'm so lousy at it.  I've gotten a little better, but, man, I'm still at the bottom of the goddamn list every game.  Every game, the scores come up, and it's like, oh, there I am.  Fucking sitting at the bottom. 
[02:11:00]  Eight and fourteen.  Eight and fourteen.  Nine and fucking twenty.  Those are the ages.  I just can't fucking get good at that game.  God damn it.  What's the problem, man?  I don't know.  It's still just not as easy to aim with that goddamn controller as it is with a mouse and keyboard,  but I'm figuring it out.  I get shot in the back all the time, which is good.  You know, that's fun.  It's a fun way to play the game.  Run, run, run, boom, you're dead. 
[02:11:30]  Run, run, run, boom, shot.  Run, run.  Oh, there's somebody.  Aim, boom, you're dead.  Yeah, it's a real treat.  What's your thoughts on Diane Keaton?  She doesn't think Woody Allen touched anybody.  She knows which side of her bread is sputtered on.  What?  Yeah.  Convinced Woody Allen never molested daughter.  She might believe that.  I mean, she knows Woody, obviously, really, really well, so maybe she has reason to believe that.  Yeah.  She touches on the ugly sexual abuse allegations against her frequent collaborator and friend, Woody Allen. 
[02:12:00]  I love what Woody Keaton tells people in the magazine's Most Beautiful Issue.  She's one of the beautiful people.  No, she's probably writing about someone beautiful.  Is she one of the beautiful people?  Aye.  The beautiful people.  That whole fucking people, beautiful people issue.  That whole people, beautiful people issue.  People, beautiful people issue, people.  All right, see, this is why we brought up the Diane Keaton story.  Now I've got to see the beautiful people.  Well.  Who do they consider beautiful this year? 
[02:12:30]  That was number one.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Is that, uh.  A whole xylophone chest.  She's all right.  I think Lucita Nyong'o is hot, dude.  I disagree.  Not the most beautiful woman in the fucking world there.  Well, it would be all models then.  They had to think a little bit of, you know.  I would make her number one.  Before we see who else is in this issue, she just says this Diane Keaton.  I love Woody.  Let's see.  I don't want to say anything about his daughter.  His daughter, uh, his daughter's accusations that he molested her, which he denies, except 
[02:13:00]  I'm Woody's friend and I believe him.  That's the bottom line for me.  I worry for him and everybody else involved and I hope it works out for the best for everyone.  That's a tough position to be in if you're friends with somebody because you basically,  in order to back Woody, you have to say his daughter is lying.  Right.  And that's a hard position to take.  And then it makes other people not want to come out and say they were fucking sexually  abused, right?  Yeah.  If she's telling the truth.  Right.  I feel like she is.  I feel like she is too, but I don't know. 
[02:13:30]  I don't know any of those people personally.  You get a feeling for some of these things though, right?  She's from Young Hole.  Look at her Eddie Murphy hairdo.  That's totally Eddie.  If you hide her face, it's Eddie Murphy's head.  Right.  She's got female features on it.  We can't find out who the beautiful people are?  She's pretty, man.  I really like her.  The fuck?  Give her a smooch.  She looks like a dude.  No.  She's got fucking...  She has a beautiful face.  She's tight.  No, she's lovely.  She's nice.  She's just tight. 
[02:14:00]  She's cheekbones, a beautiful smile, nice eyes.  She's pretty.  She bore...  I'd give her a smooch.  Hello.  See, you don't know what to say anymore.  I swear to you, if you just saw her face...  Yeah.  You wouldn't be positive it's a woman.  Exactly.  You would...  If you just saw her face and...  Because she's famous now, too.  You've got to, like, take that out of the equation.  Take that out and take the makeup off.  You would go, wow, that looks like that could be, like, a 17-year-old, uh...  Right.  Like, uh...  Like an effeminate guy.  Right.  That whole cutting the hair thing. 
[02:14:30]  I mean, believe me, I don't think those weaves are doing anyone any justice, either.  What, you don't want to run your hands through man hair?  Through ribbon candy.  It's all fucking stuck together.  Oh, good.  I got a sensible haircut.  And then you're the guy that has to rub your hands through now what feels like man hair.  Ryan hair.  Like a dude.  Right.  Yeah, it's sensible.  It's so easy.  I'm in and out of the shower now.  Yeah, great.  I'm glad you could fucking wash quicker. 
[02:15:00]  Right.  But, you know, I'm running my hands through a dude's hair.  Could be Justin Bieber, for all I know.  What the fuck are you doing?  Oh, you fucking bitches.  We can't get the beautiful people?  The beautiful people?  No, they unveiled the cover yesterday.  Oh, they don't have the list?  It's got Jennifer Lawrence.  She's a beautiful people.  Julia Roberts.  She's still hot.  She's getting slightly long in the tooth, but she's still a beautiful people. 
[02:15:30]  And Julianna Margulies.  No.  Julianna Margulies.  No.  From ER?  Is that show still on the air, ER?  I do not think that show is still on the air.  Is that George Clooney kids in there?  That up-and-comer?  I think it's not after Friends.  Something like that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Must see TV on Thursdays, I think.  Wow.  Seinfeld.  Something like that.  Nice lineup they got.  Was Friends and Seinfeld the same night?  Was it?  Well, for a while, right?  That was Thursday.  Wow.  Must see TV.  What a motherfucker to compete against that. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah, they brought it in, right?  And ER.  ER was on a 10.  ER was, yeah, yeah.  Who were the poor shows that got buried?  I was an ER fan.  Wow, right?  They're paying for it now.  They certainly are.  They certainly caught their karma.  Yeah.  Why don't we take a break so we get ready for Anthony Bourdain, who should be here any  moment.  So we'll get some commercials and crap out of the way.  And then a little later on, we got Sebastian Bach.  Oh, I saw his video with Bobby Kelly on Bind, I think. 
[02:16:30]  What?  Or Instagram.  Oh, from the, yeah, they hosted you, isn't it?  Yeah, yeah.  What, what, what?  I don't know.  Sebastian's got his hair over Bob Kelly's bald head and they're singing together.  Is it funny?  Yeah, it's pretty good.  It's funny because it's, you know, it's Bobby.  Can I say that real fast?  I think Bobby's a little starstruck.  What were they, why were they at the same event?  They were, they were, Cowhead was hosting Artie's show on, um, his video, his video, his  uh, direct TV show. 
[02:17:00]  And Bobby was there with him.  There we go.  One, two, three.  Outside my window, there's a whole lot of trouble coming.  The costume killers and the ride coming low.  Yeah, monkey bills, yeah.  Bobby, fuck Bobby.  You made me uncomfortable.  Did you see that, the, the, is it Google Street View of, uh, the cellar?  Yeah, the cellar, yeah.  And Bobby's outside?  Oh, really?  Out of the table.  Oh, my God. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, you can see that probably with pure satellite.  Jim Norton's going to be at Caroline's tonight.  We'll be back with Anthony Bourdain.  ONA will be right back on Sirius XM.

The Emmy Award winning Anthony Bourdain.  How many of you won?  Well, the show's won a bunch, and our previous show's won a bunch.  I have one statue, which I, you know, prop up next to me in bed.  Yeah. 
[02:29:30]  He's that nice.  Do you really look at it when you feel shitty?  That kind of is a nice thing to have.  It feels good.  Yeah.  Yeah, look, I make no bones about it.  You know, you see all those people walking down the red carpet.  Well, it's an honor to be nominated.  No, I wanted the fucking statue.  No, you want to win.  I really wanted it.  Of course.  Enough of that.  Yeah.  Of course.  You want to win.  All those people want to win.  Hell yeah.  I don't know if we talked about this last time, and if we did, I've got to just say  it again.  You ruined sushi for me.  Yeah.  You, I asked you.  He didn't know it was actually fish. 
[02:30:00]  I asked you the best place to get sushi in New York, and now people ask me because of  you, and it's, you told me to go to Yasuda, and I can't go anywhere else now, because I  can't get to Yasuda as much as I'd like, because it's far from here and where I live, so I try  to go local, and it's not even close to the same.  Once you've had the good stuff, you just can't go back to, you know, sort of gummy, you know,  it's the soggy seaweed and the little sort of fake crab meat in the center now.  The rice, which isn't made properly, the fake tuna. 
[02:30:30]  I know what fake tuna is now, and most places have fake tuna.  Yeah.  I feel for you.  I believe you.  Anthony doesn't eat sushi.  I'm not a big sushi gang, no.  But these places that have a decent sushi spread, but they ruin it by, they don't use real tuna  because it's too expensive.  Right.  It's that over-the-top dyed red crap that's not tuna.  No, no, the heartbreaker for me is mayonnaise.  You know, even the Japanese in Japan, like, they just love mayonnaise. 
[02:31:00]  It's like, you know, the newest discovery, you know.  I was in Las Vegas a while back, and my wife and I were, we'd eaten a big lunch.  We just wanted like a little, like a little snack, you know, just a couple of little pieces  of sushi.  There was this place on the casino floor that looked pretty decent.  Sit down, ordered a couple of little pieces, and the chef was like, oh, I'm your biggest  fan, and start sending out these like giant caterpillars, literally caterpillars, of, you  know, massive rolls, you know, wrapped in cucumber, covered with pink mayonnaise, and 
[02:31:30]  like little cucumber antennas sticking out.  You know, I didn't want to disrespect the guy.  I'm like, dutifully slogging through this thing.  Oh, God.  Was it good?  Oh, it was horrible.  I was like, you know, a little mayo.  You suited the plaque off a dead man's teeth.  Oh, shit.  What a great reveal.  That was awesome.  Yeah, because real sushi places, they don't get all fancy with their rolls.  They don't have to, because the fish is so damn good.  The best sushi, but it's about the rice. 
[02:32:00]  Well, of course.  80% the rice.  They're the best sushi place in the world.  He doesn't do any improvisational, arty, new.  He's doing the same 20 cuts of standard sushi that he's been doing for, like, 70 years.  Right.  Every day, waking up, trying to figure out, how do I make this just a little bit better,  a little more perfect?  Did you see the, you saw the sushi documentary, right?  Zero Dreams of Sushi.  Oh, my God.  That's the best meal I've had a while.  Amazing.  If I had to have a last meal, it would be there.  Really?  Amazing.  But his place only has 10 seats. 
[02:32:30]  And it's.  He has 10 seats, and everybody wants to eat there.  You would assume, you would think he would want to expand just slightly.  I'm not saying turn into a TGIF or anything, but, yeah, it's like the Cronut guy.  He doesn't care.  There's a scene in that movie where him and his rice, the guy who sells him rice, are sitting  down, and they're joking about how Marriott came to them, or one of the major hotel chains  that wants to buy the rice, which is probably a multi-million dollar account.  The guy says, no, they don't understand rice.  They're too stupid to buy my rice.  Oh, man, like the Cronut guy.  And this place is kind of like in, it looks like it's like part of the subway system or something. 
[02:33:00]  It's on a subway platform.  Really?  And it's the best sushi in pretty much the world.  25 courses in about 22 minutes.  He's standing there looking at you.  He put one piece at a time, you eat with your fingers, and he's watching you the whole time.  You don't turn and start having a conversation while his seaweed is getting soggy.  He's not liking it.  Right.  It's beautifully shot, too, if people care about filmmaking.  You know, it's not, it's very boring in general, but how it's filmed and just, it's fascinating 
[02:33:30]  that this guy has dedicated his entire life to just making the ultimate sushi.  It just made me hungry.  Did it?  Yeah.  Like, I kind of, my manager's, I think, been there where he's talked about, I kind of  want to go there just to, I can't fly to another land just to eat one meal, but it's kind of  like, I would love to do that.  Well, you turned me on to the place in L.A., but that guy has since retired, the one in  the strip mall.  Yeah, but he's still got, his son owns a place now.  What's the name of it?  I'm sure Anthony's been there.  It was Nisawa.  Well, Nisawa was the original strip mall guy, and he's in New York now.  Really? 
[02:34:00]  But, you know, that's pretty much, stick up a liquor store before you eat there, because  it's going to cost you about a thousand bucks.  Wow.  Damn.  I couldn't do that.  I couldn't spend that much.  I would have to know that the girl was really going to blow me well.  That's a lot for a meal, man.  Yeah, no shit.  What are seats to see the Knicks' good tickets cost?  Oh, hundreds.  Yeah.  Probably over a thousand.  I don't know.  You're definitely not getting blown after a Knicks game.  No, not at all. 
[02:34:30]  I'm happy with the basic seat to the Knicks game.  I don't need to, like, spend crazy money to see them.  I don't know.  Oh, the other thing, because I like catching up with you.  When you were here last, the second season of the show, I didn't see the Detroit episode  yet.  I'm obsessed with that episode.  And then it got me on a loop where I now go on YouTube and just watch videos about  Detroit.  Yeah.  And what is going on there is just fascinating.  It's an amazing and heartbreaking story. 
[02:35:00]  This is one of the most awesome American cities.  Everything cool, everything great that's American just about came out of Detroit.  Yeah.  And it really, you know, I wasn't joking when I said I've never seen any city that looks  more like Chernobyl.  Right.  And I've been to Chernobyl than Detroit.  And a lot of people in Detroit were really angry about it, most of whom live in the suburbs  and only go into Detroit proper to, you know, see a show.  But it's shocking.  So the suburbs are still in pretty good shape.  Well, they have their own tax base.  You know, they all get out there. 
[02:35:30]  Oh, right.  You said that.  Right.  They have their own tax base.  Right.  And don't really want to share the problem with the city.  Right.  Yeah.  A lot of flight.  I mean, the population has shrunk.  Mm-hmm.  You know, we had murder police telling us that they had to take the bus to crime scenes.  Yeah.  You know, because they don't have, you know, available cars.  Wouldn't they just take their own car, though, at that point?  Instead of jumping on a bus?  I didn't think they anticipated when they went to work that they'd, you know, no computers in the cars, in the patrol cars to do run, you know, checks on, you know, traffic stops. 
[02:36:00]  No city buses, really, or very mildly.  A shocking number of emergency responders, of firemen with, you know, literally moldering equipment and, you know, oxygen rigs that don't work.  Right.  You saw the Dennis Leary documentary on Detroit.  No.  What is it called?  Burn?  About the fire department?  Yeah.  That was amazing, too.  And these guys are out there still doing it every day, both the police and fire.  Right.  Just overwhelming odds.  I got to say, you touched on it slightly, but how young people are going to Detroit, and it's, I don't know, something about that, if I was younger, would excite me. 
[02:36:30]  Well, it's like, you know, homesteaders, you know, it's like what happened on the Lower East Side.  You know, it was a drug zone.  It was completely bombed out, a band of buildings, and people, you know, the first wave of people who went in were people who took over distressed properties for sweat equity.  They basically paid the backpack taxes or a small amount of money in return for promising to fix and maintain the building. 
[02:37:00]  Like, that took some real doing back then, and you really were, like, you know, out there on your own, you know, stripping a band of buildings for plumbing and doing everything you could to fix the place up and dodging some pretty scary situations, you know, when you went home every night.  Yeah, yeah.  Look at it now.  It's Disneyland.  Yeah, you got to be, the amazing people who have that foresight, like, I remember a buddy of mine, Greg, he's a comedian, bought stuff in Harlem years ago, bought a brownstone, fixed it up himself, and it's probably worth millions now. 
[02:37:30]  Of course.  Canter Loper.  But, you know, they had to put in their time, and they had to put in some work, and you got to have some courage.  But there's something adventurous about it.  If you were younger, and you didn't, you know, have a wife and two kids and a successful radio show.  Yeah, you would think about it, huh?  It might be kind of adventurous, I don't know.  You could buy a house for, like, $6,000.  Oh, I know.  Even less.  What's it going to take to fix it?  There has to be something, like the meatpacking district.  I mean, I know it's New York, it's different, but that was really shitty for years, and all of a sudden, like, one thing happens and makes it the place to be. 
[02:38:00]  What happens for Detroit that all of a sudden it's like, oh, God, let's, and it draws people there, and it's like mass gentrification, really?  The city probably needs to shrink in size, which is, you know, it's way spread out.  And, you know, people got to invest money.  People got to go in and start businesses and buy up buildings.  It's just the city, when that happens, it's going to change, you know, like the meatpacking district, like the Lower East Side.  You know, it arguably, did those places get better? 
[02:38:30]  Well, yeah, okay, you're not going to get your throat cut by a feral crackhead going home.  But on the other hand, you know, it's all, you know, hipster baristas and, you know, vegan burritos.  Right.  So you lose something, you get something.  I don't want to be there either.  Yeah.  I would just grow pot.  Really?  Right on the sides of the abandoned buildings.  Maybe they are.  Start a pot industry.  Is it legal in Michigan?  Not yet.  Oh, they should fix that.  They got plenty of land to plant.  Oh, boy, do they.  Yeah. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah.  But I really enjoy that episode.  I enjoy your show in general, but that episode especially was really fascinating.  Having a lot of fun, a lot of fun doing it.  Now, the other thing, because I'm a man trying to stay in shape and so is the rest of the guys here.  Try it.  Look at that body.  It's working.  Do you like, do you go on a crazy diet before you start filming these shows?  Because you eat everything in sight when you go to these places.  I'm not sitting around with a big bag of, you know, Cheetos in between shoots, you know.  I mean, if I know I'm eating a big lunch, I'm not scheduling a dinner scene if I can avoid it at all. 
[02:39:30]  Right.  I pretty much, I try to pace myself.  If I'm doing an Italy show, we're going to be eating nothing like pasta and great cheese and bread for 10 days.  I mean, the whole crew is going to put on 10 pounds.  We're careful not to do a France show right after that.  You know, we'll be fine.  You're going to Ethiopia or something.  Pretty much.  Mexico, we're going to be shitting.  That's exactly what we do.  You balance it out because you have to, you know, you've got to keep the weight off for TV as well. 
[02:40:00]  Right.  You know, we're literally a TV star.  You are a TV star, sir.  Italy followed by India where, you know, you'll be, you know, healthily shedding some pounds.  Right.  Eating delicious food, you know, shitting your weight.  Dysentery.  Yeah, that's the old thing.  Delicious food.  Delicious food.  Go to Mexico and have some water.  I've never eaten Indian food.  I want to eat it.  Everyone says it's great.  You will.  Look, the spices and, I mean, you're not going to get, I think the threat is wildly overstated.  I've never been, I eat nothing but street food for the most part in India.  I've never been, it's never made me ill. 
[02:40:30]  But, yeah, all that spice, you will spend some extra time, you know, buckled up.  I never got into Indian food.  That's one of the foods I've not really.  Oh, it's so good.  I can eat vegetarian in India for, you know, sustained periods of time.  Wow.  I want to try it here in New York.  I mean, we're just in a restaurant and I want to ask you what a good place is because I want to try it.  But I just, I can, I'm always scared I'm going to get sick.  I don't do the gym, though, except sporadically, you know, my whole family's doing jiu-jitsu now.  Okay, my wife, of course, lives at the Henzo Gracie Academy and my daughter goes like six hours a week now. 
[02:41:00]  Really?  Wow.  She's turning into a little killer.  You're like the wimp in the family.  That's right.  I go.  I go now.  They got me into it.  Oh, you go?  You like it?  I really love it, but I go really irregularly.  So, you know, I'll go, you know, once or twice a week if I have the time back in New York and just around the time that I'm finally getting to the point that, you know, I'm not struggling to throw up, you know, to not throw up on myself and lay on the ground wheezing and gasping in between, you know, segments. 
[02:41:30]  Just when I'm getting in reasonably, my cardio's getting kind of good and I can make it through an hour session without embarrassing myself, then I'm gone for three weeks and, you know, shoving pasta in my face and drinking too much and I come back and start all over again, getting hammered.  The new season, where do you go?  So far, we've been to Punjab.  We did a Vegas show last Sunday.  This one is, coming up Sunday, is France, Lyon in particular with Daniel Boulou and it's really like the greatest hits of French cooking and really it tries to track where these great chefs came from. 
[02:42:00]  I mean, they're all like farm boys and poor kids who grew up in this abusive system of going to work at 14 years old.  That's something we kind of forget about when you see these fancy chefs in their white jackets and exclusive expensive restaurants.  We think this is some kind of elitist thing.  Most of these recipes, all of these techniques and the chefs themselves all came from, in almost every case, from very poor, very hardworking backgrounds and put in their time. 
[02:42:30]  So, obviously, it's something I'm sympathetic to.  But I ate well on this show.  We've done a lot of, like, serious high-test food porn over the years at 14 years.  But this is the best.  This is the show that you're just going to sit there just drooling, you know, find something to eat before watching this one.  Really? How many calories do you think you took in?  In one meal?  You will not believe, when you see, you will not believe that any human being could eat all of this. 
[02:43:00]  Oh, my God.  It's just so good and also epic.  I mean, eating meals that will never be seen on television before, you know, never have been seen before and will never be seen again.  There's some really old-school, really crazy, over-the-top stuff.  We've become kind of obsessed with a famous pastry chef here, this Dominique Ansel.  Yeah.  The Cronut guy.  And the idea that he just will not, because you're talking about these guys being farm boys. 
[02:43:30]  Maybe there's a pride to it, but he just will not capitalize all you can.  It's art.  It's art to some of these guys.  It's like this.  He's no different, very good guy, by the way, very humble, good dude.  He's a lot like some of the really great pitmasters, barbecue pitmasters, who figured out this is the maximum amount of brisket I can do without the quality starting to decline.  And they're just not willing to do more.  That's it.  This is the maximum controllable amount I can crank out of this small space without it becoming crap. 
[02:44:00]  But your customers aren't going to notice if it drops slightly.  Your personal, your whole identity.  And I like him.  He's working 12, 14, 16 hours a day.  His whole, everything he is, is in his product.  And if he goes home knowing that he made a less good cronaut, he's going to be miserable.  You know, he'll do terrible things to himself.  I mean, people really, chefs, just that really, really seriously.  Franchise it to Sam's Club and stop already. 
[02:44:30]  Why does he sell stuff like Matt Sell them under his name?  Because other people are stealing them.  I think we should learn from Dominic Ansell and only do one hour of radio a day.  Oh, but a quality hour.  That hour would be wonderful.  It's integrity.  And there's vanity, too.  Look, you know, I'd very much like to take a big, fat paycheck for doing, like, a, you know,  tidy bowl commercial or, you know, whatever.  I can't.  I don't want to be that guy.  With that said, and we did a whole show on this, everyone else is selling his cronauts. 
[02:45:00]  They're everywhere.  And they're doing them badly.  I think it was two days ago we saw a cheeseburger.  On two cronauts.  They're using the cronauts as the roll, obviously.  So that's going to drive them crazy.  Actually, the cronaut is not the best thing at that shop.  He has a thing.  I forget.  It's a traditional order.  Yeah, that thing is amazing.  That's what he says is his best.  And there are plenty of those.  Yeah.  He loves the DK more than the cronaut.  But he should box them.  Even have someone with his recipe make them, not mass-produce them, but at least make them 
[02:45:30]  available.  Because, say, at least this is from the actual baker.  People will still go to his store to get what they want.  But this way, people aren't confusing your product with a lot of the dog shit that's  out there.  Because they're all calling them cronauts.  So if it's like Dominique has cronauts.  The day will come when he's going to hit 40 and say, okay, I've had enough.  I've made some money.  I'll invest in a bigger store and some more equipment.  And it's time to make money.  I think a lot of chefs hit that point. 
[02:46:00]  He's known around the world.  I mean, it's a guess, obviously.  How much do you think he makes?  I would ridiculously small amounts of money.  Like, ludicrously little.  A couple hundred thousand a year?  I'd be shocked.  Which is small considering his reputation.  I'd be shocked.  I mean, do the math.  See, that's crazy to me.  He hit with something that everyone loves.  Most of these great restaurants that we're talking about that are charging massive amounts  of money, they're not taking that much out of that place.  Really?  You know, not what you think.  Wow.  It's a low profit margin business, this restaurant thing. 
[02:46:30]  That's why the prices are so high.  Just to have a business in New York is crazy.  Yeah.  Your partner is your landlord.  Yeah.  Well, my neighborhood, all the restaurants have gone away over the last year.  They have, right?  Upper West.  It's sad.  You used to go walk down that Columbus Avenue.  Not that they were the greatest restaurants, but it was just festive.  I worked on Columbus back in the day.  Yeah.  They've all been replaced by Victoria's Secret and merch.  Oh, that's true.  Hubba, hubba.  Yeah. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah.  Sad to see, is what I'm saying.  It takes the flavor away.  Tough on the Upper West Side.  It's been sort of a no-go zone for restaurants.  Conventional wisdom has always been, you know, stay away from the neighborhood.  It's really hard to make it.  There's money there, though.  People don't want to spend on the Upper West Side.  I don't know why.  Or the reputation is that customers want, you know, value that's just not worth it for  a lot of people.  Are you concerned that there's a guy from vice.com, it looks like, has been, Simon, I want to say  his name is Ostrowski.  I think that's how you say his last name was taken by pro-Russian forces or whatever. 
[02:47:30]  Right.  It's being held right now.  I don't know if he...  Well, first of all, these pro-Russian forces, you know, the credulousness with which we've  been talking about this.  These pro-Russian insurgents, no, they are Russian-controlled operatives of the special  services.  Okay, so let's cut the shit.  But is that better for him, though?  Better for him.  It is, right, yeah.  These are, as I understand it, these are people under discipline.  Professionals, yeah.  That said, look, Vice has been reporting from incredibly sketchy situations. 
[02:48:00]  They've been really hanging their balls out there for years.  I've been to a lot of the places that they've covered, and I watch those shows, like what  they're up to in places like Liberia, and I think they've been to Syria, and I'm just  saying, wow, something really bad is going to happen inevitably.  They've been getting away with it.  I get a lot of respect.  They're reporting from places that nobody else is telling. 
[02:48:30]  They're maniacs.  They're telling stories that nobody else is telling.  They know how to have a good time.  I think, I hope that this will work out okay.  You know, when bad things happen in Ukraine, hopefully, generally, one would think there's  a better chance of a happy outcome.  When bad things happen in, like, Liberia or Congo, or a place where there's just total  anarchy.  Those EIA countries.  Different.  The EIAs.  The EIA countries are very bad.  They report from a lot of places where just the guy next to you in the market could suddenly 
[02:49:00]  turn, point at you, and say, CIA, and suddenly everybody in the place is wailing on you for  no other reason, and why not?  I don't know how they, there's the one where they interview, every Vice segment ends like  this, and we knew it was time to get the hell out of there.  It's fucking dangerous, man.  No doubt.  Talking to the guy, like a legit Taliban guy, and it's just, I think it was Shane and like  one other guy.  Pissing them off.  Yeah.  Asking the wrong, like the wrong questions to be, you know.  Right.  Oh, shit.  And they're small crews. 
[02:49:30]  You know, they're not, you know, it's not this big convoy.  Right.  You know, when we went to Libya, we were a small crew, but we, you know, we hired a local  militia from, from Misrata, you know, all these kids, heavily armed kids who had some  street cred and, you know, looked after us.  How old were the kids?  Oh, man, early, early 20s, all of them veterans of, you know, a lot of, I mean, a lot of them  were sort of veterans of some problem.  Well, okay, a lot of them were Libyan expats who'd been, you know, studying medicine in Montreal 
[02:50:00]  who, when they heard that there was a chance, went back and, you know, learned how to, you  know, work a rocket launcher.  How's Libya now, since you were there?  Uh, look, it's not a happy situation there.  There are a lot of bad people who would like to kill Americans.  There are a lot of people there who would like the Libyan thing to not work.  Uh, a lot of forces, uh, with different agendas, uh, work there.  Uh, the people I met and the people we work with were pretty realistic about their prospects. 
[02:50:30]  They said, look, it's going to take us five years to get our shit together here, at least.  But they were also pretty optimistic.  He says, look, we got Gaddafi out.  No one said we could do that.  Right.  We can get these Al-Qaeda dudes out too.  Look, I hope they're right.  It's a very, very, it's one of those places where there are a lot of people who would be  all too happy to, you know, kill the people in this room.  I think we get a little, uh, self-centered here in the States thinking that what's best  for some of these countries is what would be best for us.  And what we consider to be a good way of life and, and, uh, a good form of government when 
[02:51:00]  that's just not the case.  We're not going to get the best case scenario.  We're not going to get a Western style democracy with a friendly president who loves Americans.  But for the Libyans, you, we hope they will end up with a, a non-maniac.  Right.  That's what you're looking for.  He's not going to be dangerous to their neighbors.  A non-maniac.  Yes.  Vote for me.  I'm a non-maniac.  Look, I have a lot of sympathy for them.  I had a lot of really, you know, really nice people who were incredibly courageous. 
[02:51:30]  I mean, these guys were fighting with, with homemade weapons.  They made out of like hair dryers, crossbows that fired, uh, Molotov cocktails at, at Russian  tanks.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A lot of courage.  Um, uh, you know, it's a very do it yourself situation there where, you know, police and,  uh, and emergency services are largely manned by, you know, just volunteer militias.  It's pretty chaotic.  Um, but I mean, I'm rooting for them to sort their shit out. 
[02:52:00]  I, you know, I, I met a lot of people who, with a lot of courage who just want,  to be, you know, to have the things that we have.  And it's a volatile region.  Yeah.  Let's just, let's just say it's a volatile region.  They're trying to figure it out though.  That episode was promising.  The thing is, uh, they're all connected in some way or another also.  So you could have a country that really wants to get on the, the right path and, uh, start  being productive in the world and not a detriment.  And then they're bordering countries to keep dragging them into conflicts. 
[02:52:30]  Bad neighbors is a problem always.  I mean, look, you go to Lebanon and you go to Beirut and it's just, it's amazing city.  I mean, you know, you could be, you know, standing by the pool, drinking cocktails, you  know, with in the background, get in a cab and four minutes later, you're in a Hezbollah  neighborhood.  Yeah.  It's very different situation than we live in.  And there are a lot of, uh, you know, the alignment of power in that part of the world 
[02:53:00]  is, uh, a little more complex than, uh, some of our foreign policy geniuses would have us  believe.  So the conflict has only been recent.  So, um, it should solve it very quickly.  I'm sure.  Yeah.  I love these op-ed pieces, you know, uh, you know, you know, how to solve the problems  in the Middle East, you know, 3,000 words.  Okay.  There you go.  Well, even more fun is having a debate on Twitter about it.  140.  How could I spell this out in 140 characters?  Well, I love it.  I was in, I was in, uh, Gaza and, uh, I was talking to some Gazan friends there and they 
[02:53:30]  described this big honcho, big foot op-ed dude from the New York times coming to visit.  Oh, yes.  He came into town, stayed in this hotel, never left.  Wow.  Yeah.  The taxi's in, stays in the hotel with the other journalists.  They all talk to each other, reporting from Gaza, you know.  Wow.  Yeah.  What'd you see?  I don't know.  I saw them.  I saw the breakfast before.  Out the window.  Oh, he didn't leave.  I think he died.  He didn't leave the hotel.  Not at all.  But according to my taxi driver, things are really getting better.  Uh-huh.  Let me talk to the locals.  They don't understand. 
[02:54:00]  They don't say the fact that people just hate each other on a deep level.  Like, they take that out of the equation.  They look at, like, well, if the land is given, and they don't realize that people hate each  other's guts beyond any agreement.  It's not just about land.  Right.  There's just a history.  They fucking hate each other.  Well, there's also situations where people are still pissed off about shit that happened  four or five hundred years ago.  Yeah.  You know, in a former Yugoslavia, I mean, the anger over the Battle of Kosovo, which happened,  I think, I'm not sure, like, seventeen, hundred, eighteen, I mean, a long fucking time ago. 
[02:54:30]  Still pretty peeved about that one.  I think it happened yesterday.  Uh-huh.  Amazing.  So where's the most dangerous place?  Going with Jimmy's, uh, was it Libya, or?  For me, that I've ever been?  Um, uh, look, Congo was probably.  Oh, that's right.  You said the Congo.  You know, the sketchiest.  But, I mean, the closest, honestly, the closest I've come to death has probably just been  driving from location to location, and, you know, places like Vietnam or, uh, you know,  where people are really, the roads are not great, and you're driving, the driving style 
[02:55:00]  is just crazy.  Reckless in Switzerland.  Oh, my God.  I saw an article recently on the, I guess it was the ten most dangerous cities in the  world, and, um, I guess, uh, Brazil, uh, one of the cities, I guess.  More than Juarez, Mexico?  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, that came up as, like, just the amount of murder that goes on is insane.  And I've been in Brazil many, many times.  I've never had a problem there.  Yeah.  Love it. 
[02:55:30]  Uh, I think if you dress smart and behave smart in Brazil, you, you know, you shouldn't  have a problem.  That said, people I know and people around me have had real problems.  What kind of problems?  Were they kidnapping problems?  Kidnapping or just random, uh, random shootings.  Somebody didn't like the way you look at them at a, at a, at a stoplight, you know.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That seems to be the problem.  Go back to Beirut.  Someone on the line, uh, said that you were scared shitless about getting out of there.  There's a story there.  Well, when I was there in 2006, I was caught in the war.  Uh, you know, I look out my window. 
[02:56:00]  My crew, we're all sitting around drinking out of the minibar and, you know, the Israeli  jets have been flying overhead all night, real close.  Uh, Hezbollah had kidnapped some Israeli soldiers.  The mood was really bad and we're sitting around drinking.  We look out my window, uh, and just as the rockets come in and blow up the airport and  realize, uh, this is not good.  And then all of our fixers, our local translators, everybody, they were all like headed for Syria.  You know, we're getting out of here.  It's war and we can't.  So we're just left there. 
[02:56:30]  And, um, why couldn't you go with them?  Oh, you can't go to Syria.  The network was not letting us, first of all, they were bombing the roads.  Secondly, you know, we have a car, people who don't have a car desperate to get out.  We don't know what that situation is.  We don't know if the, the Christians and, uh, the Shia are going to start fighting.  We don't, we, we, we, we don't know what's going to happen.  And the network is just saying, no, stay put.  Um, it wasn't so much frightening as it was, as, as it progressed, as we were there for 
[02:57:00]  day after day after day, and the, the cell phone bars are getting fewer and fewer.  It was that we're going to lose contact with home and that, you know, people who cared for  us were, were going to be panicking and worried that we'd lose touch.  It wasn't, there is a sense when you're an American with an American passport in a place  like Beirut that, you know, even with the bombs coming in and the rockets and all of that,  they know we're here.  They won't hit us.  It's not our war.  And there's that sense of, there was a real sense of, uh, of shame standing there by the 
[02:57:30]  pool, literally day after day, looking out, uh, watching neighborhoods being blown up,  uh, you know, a mile away, a half mile away.  How long were you actually stuck there?  Uh, a little over a week.  We got out with the Marines off, uh, they finally took us off the beach, uh, uh, you know,  when the LCUs came in, front drops down, you know, me and a whole bunch of refugees, you  know, we all, you know, the boat, they take us out to the Nashville and, uh, we slept on 
[02:58:00]  the flight deck and they took us to Cyprus and, uh, the network flew us back.  You know, when your airport blows up, the flight's probably going to be delayed.  A little bit.  I was as bad as United and Newark.  So wait, wait, wait, how far were you from the beach?  Like, how did you get from the hotel to the beach?  Um, it was close, but bare roots, uh, right on the beach, but I mean, you know, there was  a total blockade of, you know, everything and, and the, the bombing was, they were hitting  not just strategic targets, but other stuff. 
[02:58:30]  And, uh, fortunately, you know, the, the, the, the social contract didn't break down.  The Levitis didn't start shooting at each other.  Uh, yeah.  Oh man.  And in fact, the last, everybody left us, um, everyone left us.  The one guy who wouldn't was a Shia dude from what would be called in the newspapers anyway,  his Bala neighborhood, a Shia, predominantly Shia neighborhood in the poor part of Beirut  and his neighborhood, as we're in the room, airport burning and our fixers and translators 
[02:59:00]  all say, well, we have to go.  This guy was the one who wouldn't leave us.  He was the guy, his cell phone is going off every five minutes.  His family is calling in a panic because the whole neighborhood is going up.  And he refuses.  No, I am with you.  I am with you.  I'm with you.  And he's, he stayed.  We had to kick him out, essentially.  He said, go back to your family for fuck's sake.  He probably wanted to stay in a nice safe hotel, right?  Not go back to that fucking neighborhood.  It was very, very, very cool of him.  Wow.  That's unbelievable.  How is he now?  Or you don't know?  He, he made it. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah.  Good.  Uh, Jack in Jacksonville wants to say hi.  Jack.  Hey.  Sorry.  Hey, Anthony, I'd like you to comment, if you would, on one of the biggest scams perpetrated  in an American food market.  They're called tilapia.  But actually, they've analyzed it.  It actually contains more fat than bacon.  Yet, it's everywhere.  Tilapia.  Look, I hate, I hate this stuff.  It's, uh, it's generally a farm-raised, sort of generic, uh, uh, fish-like product.  I, I, I just hate it.  Uh, wait, tilapia? 
[03:00:00]  Not always.  I mean, there's farm tilapia, and then you see a lot of, uh, everywhere you go where they  need and want fish, you see a lot of tilapia.  Oh.  Um, it's, uh, it's, uh, but, but I, I just don't like this stuff.  Uh, I, I, I, it's fattening.  I didn't know that.  I don't eat it.  Chances are, if you're getting tilapia in the States, it's, chances are it's farm-raised,  it's super fatty, and, uh, I, I, to my mind, it just doesn't taste good.  How do you get a fat fish?  I don't know.  It's never, well, I'm just saying.  Well, salmon's a fatty fish, but it's good fat. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  A nurse shark.  It's omega-6 is the bad fat, is what's in it.  Yeah.  Wow.  I just don't like this stuff.  It tastes like, uh, you know, uh, when your turtle died as a kid, you know, and you forgot  to clean the tank.  Yes!  That's that tank, you know?  Yes, that's exactly it.  I never owned a turtle.  You've got that fish tank stench.  You are a turtle.  I know, I, I, I realize that my, my physical is, is a cause for humor in your eyes.  I do the best I can.  Come on, hurt me.  I'm an easy target.  But no, I was, it was at our gym open, I was, uh, they, uh, tilapia, and I'm eating it once, 
[03:01:00]  I'm like, this stuff fucking sucks.  I don't like that.  Never.  Just not.  That's how it's prepared.  The fish itself is horrible.  Another big scam.  Prepared the same way.  Chilean sea bass.  Thank you.  Ah, yes.  It's tasty, though.  The fish of the year for ages.  Oh, it's so great, Chilean sea bass.  That stuff that was, like, eating, like, styrofoam surfboard or something.  Oh, you don't like it?  But mushy, frozen, farmed.  It's not even a Chilean sea bass.  It's a Patagonian toothfish that they renamed.  Oh, man.  I was going to tell you to go down that road.  It's nasty. 
[03:01:30]  We're running out of fish, so we're starting to eat fish we never ate before and just giving  them fancy names, and Chilean sea bass is at the top of that list.  Yeah.  I thought it was called the dogfish or something like that, but it was, whatever.  It doesn't matter.  What's a healthy white fish thing?  Because I eat a lot of the, as I call it, the Chilean sea bass.  That's what I'm going to say.  That's what I'm going to say.  That's what I'm going to say.  That's what I'm going to say.  I don't like Chilean sea bass at all.  How do you, what is, what is a good healthy white fish, then, that's, you know, good for  the waistline?  Look, flounder or any of its relatives, you know, a cod, a halibut. 
[03:02:00]  Okay.  Fluke.  Yeah.  Fluke sushi is amazing.  Halibut's great.  I like a good halibut.  But I like those oily, dark fish.  You know, I love, like, macros, you know, what are, used to be called trash fish.  I love, like, fresh sardines, macros, blue fish.  Good stuff.  As long as it's fresh.  Sardines are real.  I like the oil out of them.  I don't mean that.  I mean, you know, fresh, grilled, you know, rubbing a little garlic, throw them on the grill.  Beautiful.  My in-laws will just open a can of sardines and go to town. 
[03:02:30]  I'm like, oh, my God.  That's horrendous.  They love it.  Fresh sardines on the grill.  Beautiful.  Yeah.  I can't do it.  I've never had one.  Can't do it.  I just had the canned ones.  And I use that reference a lot when this situation is tight-fitting.  I'll mention the little fellas.  Hey, probably a hat question, but I've got to ask.  Are you eating any crazy things this season?  The Canadian episode last season where you're eating the beaver tail or whatever the hell it was.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  It was good. 
[03:03:00]  I know.  You told us that last time.  I just don't understand.  I don't know if I run into anything.  I was with the Maasai in Tanzania recently.  And, you know, they're into, like, basically kill the goat.  And basically they're all over the fresh blood right out of the calf, chest cavity, and the raw kidney.  They're super into that.  That's got to be dangerous.  And I was sort of hosted by a group of Maasai.  They had me deliver the bad news to the goat and to butcher it. 
[03:03:30]  I felt really proud of myself because they were very impressed with my butchering skills.  They did not expect that of me.  But they, yeah, once you open them up, they're all in there with their hands, you know, drinking the blood right out of the cavity and yanking the kidneys out.  Do you think the parasites would just, like, eat you up from ingesting that?  Compared to what?  I don't know.  You just assume that here in the States that's, I don't know.  Why would you assume that?  I don't know.  Why?  Because you assume that USDA stamp means something. 
[03:04:00]  I'm sure.  Or the refrigeration means something.  Refrigeration actually means that, you know, you can keep stuff longer than you would in the developing world.  I mean, most of the time, in my experience, the food, like street food, is fresher and better and often safer than the stuff where you can rely on a freezer.  You know, keep throwing that bolognese sauce back in the freezer every time, you know.  Yeah.  We'll hold it until tomorrow. 
[03:04:30]  It's good for another day.  No, it's not.  I don't know, though.  The thought of eating a Tanzanian goat kidney or having a fucking, you know, burger here in the States.  Or taking your hands and scooping up the blood.  Scooping up some blood.  Did you try it?  Oh, yeah.  Was it all right?  Yeah, it's cool.  It's fine.  Very salty, right?  What made you gag?  I'm sure you don't really.  There's stuff, you know, if it's actively rotten, there are some cultures that like to rot and ferment stuff.  That's a problem.  That is an odd little practice buds for that. 
[03:05:00]  I think a lot of cultures where it's really, really cold and it's basically, oh, herring again, herring again, you know, where there's a narrow flavor spectrum.  For kicks, they like to get stuff really funky and ripe.  It's like exciting.  Wakes them up.  Wow.  Makes them dick hard, you know.  Yeah.  I like fermented stuff.  I love kimchi.  I like, you know, but if it's actively rotten and slimy.  What's a rotten, slimy food?  Lutefisk or heart. 
[03:05:30]  Oh, we talked about that.  Yeah.  I like his records.  There are a lot of cultures that do that.  Hot Carl, I've had those.  Wow.  Yeah, it's slimy, rotting.  Fish.  Fish.  Where was that again?  There's something that's a fermented pork dish, I think, where is that?  I think in China.  It's for a fermented.  It's tough.  Do they really enjoy it?  Yeah.  They seem to.  Oh, they love it.  Do you like your filter fish?  I had that once.  It was horrendous. 
[03:06:00]  Not a fan.  Yeah.  I certainly am not judging.  The slaughtering of animals, is that tough for you?  It's tough for me.  I don't like it.  I mean.  I just know I just personally couldn't do it.  I'm not a, I'm not a, um, I believe if you hunt, you should eat it.  Mm-hmm.  Um, I'm not a big hunter, but I do hunt on the show.  I, I enjoy it, but it's in every case we're hunting what we intend to eat that day, and  only that, uh, don't have any real sympathy for trophy hunters, in fact, are kind of contemptuous 
[03:06:30]  of them.  Uh, look, I don't like killing animals, but a lot of the times on the show, we're going  to a traditional pig roast or something like that.  Now, that pig is going to die, okay?  And it's going to die because we're doing a pig roast scene.  Right.  So I've essentially, Michael Corleone style, I've, I've, I've killed it already, okay?  The order has been given.  You said, hello, piggy, and you choked it in the car.  The pig goes tonight, you know, so whether I do it personally or not, uh, I'm responsible 
[03:07:00]  for this pig's death, so, uh, I will, I will, I think that level of discomfort and guilt is  appropriate.  You ever see, uh, other cultures slaughter an animal to the point where you're like, wow,  as an American or whatever, I just, this is crazy.  Well, I think one of the things that the animal activists don't get is that the poorer people  are, and the worse the conditions they live in, uh, the less concerned they are with  those things, you know, being, dispatching an animal quickly or, or, or letting it live 
[03:07:30]  in, in reasonably happy, uh, comfortable conditions until such time as it's killed for food, it's  not a priority when you're just struggling and fighting to live every day.  You know, you're jamming 30 chickens in a little cage and then you're bringing them to market  and you're dispatching them any way necessary.  Yeah, we have people that feed steak to their dogs here and, you know, dog is food somewhere  else.  Right.  Yeah.  I mean, so I've seen, I've seen a lot of animals go in different, in different, uh, ways.  Most of the people, uh, this last time, punch it to death. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah, you're going to love this.  Now I suffocated it the traditional way because they want the blood to stay in the, in the,  they want it to stay in the, in the chest cavity.  You pinch off its nose and you hold its mouth closed and you lean on top.  Oh my God.  Wow.  You just did.  Wow.  It's like I said, I was, I'm sure they're going to cut this in the show.  It's like, I don't remind you of the last time I visited grandma at the old age.  Oh my God.  That's hilarious.  Oh my God.  Jesus.  You gave it the old Christopher from the Sopranos.  Yes. 
[03:08:30]  Wow.  Did he go to the fountain through the window?  Did he give it any, uh, sorry grandma, I just can't afford it anymore.  Oh yeah.  His little goat feet were kicking.  Yeah.  Wow.  Wow.  That's, uh, that's a fucking, that's some way to do it.  Another question.  Hands on right there.  Have you ever eaten one of the, uh, this is the part of the interview where we get the  fun questions.  Have you ever eaten one of those rotted duck eggs they serve in the Philippines?  Okay.  They're, uh, they're half-turned duck eggs. 
[03:09:00]  It's called balut in Vietnam called hot vin long.  And it's basically a soft boiled, a half-turned duck egg.  So you've got the fetus of the duck in there.  So you get these little beaky feathery bits in there.  Come on, who wants to eat this?  It's a hugely popular dish in the Philippines, but it's supposed to make you fertile and strong  and much, much, much, I'm not, I'm not a fan.  How much could you actually eat?  How much did you get through? 
[03:09:30]  Like, did you eat the whole egg?  You could, I've eaten, I've eaten the whole egg.  It's like a dead, a fucking half-rotted dead bird.  It's not rotted.  You said half-turned.  What's that mean?  Half-turned.  Half-formed.  It's like a feathery, beaky little, it's like an old beak that's floating inside your  semi-cooked egg.  Is that the one that's black?  It's like the egg is dark.  No, that's the thousand-year egg.  Oh, right, the thousand-year egg.  What's a thousand-year egg?  It's not a thousand-year egg.  It's my naive.  But it's basically like a big, soft-boiled egg with a little bird in it.  Do you feel bad when you're chewing the beak? 
[03:10:00]  Little guy.  Little guy, Jimmy.  Yeah, that's a little much.  I'm respectful of others' food ways.  Why are the agents like...  No, that's why I'm asking, because you have to move into everyone else's cultures.  Oh, yeah.  And I wonder if that's strange to you at times, that's all.  Look, just think about what it must look like for them.  You know, somebody helping themselves to cottage cheese from the buffet, you know, here.  Right.  Or a Cinnabon, you know, some 550-pound, you know, Texan. 
[03:10:30]  Fucking radio worker.  Eating a Cinnabon at 4 o'clock in the morning must be just truly appalling.  In fact, what's really weird is you see what American food shows are popular abroad.  I mean, I was just watching food television, you know, the local networks, what shows they buy.  And it's, man versus food is huge.  All those, like, bacon paradise and bacon wars.  Anything where it's, like, obese Americans shoving massive amounts of, like, bacon and burgers. 
[03:11:00]  I think they just sit there and say, oh, look at these monsters.  We were right about America.  It's a very bad place.  It just confirms their worst prejudices about America because they really, it's all about competitive eating or gorging or eating these massive, massive things.  Iraq could be Seinfeld over there.  Are we officially the fattest nation or?  I don't think so.  Who beats us out?  The Samoans or whatever? 
[03:11:30]  You know, that whole stroke belt in the South Pacific, the Spam belt is pretty hefty.  The Spam belt.  Scotland and England are catching up, I think.  Really?  I don't know who's actually fattest, but, you know.  Right.  Yeah, I think we're probably doing pretty good over here, though.  I could be psyched.  Inside jokes there, Anthony.  I don't know.  One of our guys a little heavy.  He's not even that heavy.  That's the best part about it.  I couldn't eat that egg.  I wouldn't be able to do it.  I physically wouldn't be able to do it.  I would vomit.  If we got you fucked up enough. 
[03:12:00]  Oh, so the alcohol does help, I guess.  It's a bar snack.  Yeah, it's a bar snack.  I'll take the fucking bowl of chips.  What's that?  I do love about the show that you don't hide the drinking, either.  You partake in a lot of alcoholic beverages.  It's an important part of the process.  It's awesome, though.  But you're not hiding it.  You've got to wash that down.  Wash it down.  Yeah.  Look, it's a luxury that I can do that on my show.  But I think other TV hosts are expected to behave or not slur. 
[03:12:30]  Right.  They're also expected to shave and, you know.  Maybe dress for the occasion.  Something like that.  Half the time you do look like you're on your way to court for a DWI.  Yes.  Let's go to Joe and Detroit checking in.  Joe.  Oh, hey, man.  It's actually Bill.  Hey.  Anthony, number one.  I'm a big fan.  Bill Troy.  I'm a cook store. 
[03:13:00]  And, yeah, I love that.  You know, you talk about Beirut.  I mean, that was a pretty scary episode.  And Anthony about Detroit, there was a show a few years ago, Life After People, where they actually did a lot of computer generation.  Oh, yeah, sure.  We saw it.  What's scary about Detroit was they actually just went to Detroit and filmed the buildings.  They didn't have to do the CGI work of like...  I'm originally from Detroit. I'm down in Atlanta now. 
[03:13:30]  It's crazy. They just went to the city.  And because it's like John R., there's just a lot of great old buildings that have fallen apart since the 68th riot.  So it's about 40 years later.  And they were just building.  So this is actual buildings.  This is the way it is going to look after a man has gone.  It's called downtown Detroit, which is so sad because it's such a beautiful city.  Beautiful buildings. Beautiful city.  I mean, really, no place like it.  Just falling apart.  I mean, what's sad about it is like my sister-in-law lives in Chicago.  I go over there, you're in Chicago, and you sort of look out on the lake, and it's like, why can't Detroit do this? 
[03:14:00]  And then you go back to Detroit, and part of the problem with Detroit was the ex-mayor, Coleman Young.  I mean, it was very racial, and it still is to this day.  It's sad.  Politically, there's obviously a problem with Detroit.  But the industry, that's the biggest thing.  Chicago didn't have an industry that completely failed. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah, and it isn't Motown anymore because all the factories have gone south.  Because, you know, it's like Flint, Michigan.  I grew up near there.  It used to be Buick Town.  They've torn all the plants down.  It's gone.  General Motors is left out.  That's just what happens.  Industry changes, and then people are left in the dust.  You go south of Buffalo down the Great Lakes, and you see all these old factories and industries there that just dried up.  Yeah, we were shooting in Western Mass, you know, in these mill towns and places where, you know, all the cutlery producers and mills closed up. 
[03:15:00]  We just shot in Mississippi in the Delta where, you know, cotton and most of their industries disappeared.  Well, I think we all have to start thinking buy American again.  Of course.  Yeah, but the unions make it too expensive.  And I'm not even shitting on the unions.  It's hard to do when there's such high prices.  I'm all for rampant capitalism, but, you know, to my way of thinking, if you want to move your company offshore to save money, we shouldn't help you, okay? 
[03:15:30]  We shouldn't, you know, our tax dollars shouldn't help you take American jobs away.  In fact, we should whack you with a big, make it expensive for you to move offshore.  Or, you know, I don't care about your damn stockholders.  I care about Americans.  We need to make stuff.  We're turning into a country that's in the business largely.  You know, what businesses, what jobs are replacing these manufacturing jobs?  Service jobs.  Yeah.  We're going to end up, you know, a nation, someone said, who's basically in the business of selling each other cheeseburgers. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah.  Or carrying golf bags for our future masters.  Servicing other people's great ideas in an industry.  Right.  Yeah.  The best part of your show I love is, like, the last minute.  I love your...  Well, thank you.  Oh, thanks.  Oh, wait a minute.  It's fantastic.  The part I always, like, wait for at the end, because you're such a brilliant guy.  So, it's been great talking to you, and I can't wait to see the next show.  Thanks.  Thanks, Joe.  I think one more call here.  This one is intriguing, and then we'll get Anthony out of here. 
[03:16:30]  Greg in Tucson.  Greg.  Hey, it's Frank.  No problem.  Why are the names wrong?  By the way, who's doing the fucking following?  They got two in a row wrong.  No problem.  Molly Maitland?  Old-ass reference.  I got a question for you.  Yeah.  Look at those two other pricks, even though I love them.  The cheese that they put the larva in, and then the larva eat the inside of the cheese,  and then puke it out.  I've seen this.  And they ban it.  Have you tried that?  Yes, that's a Sardinian cheese. 
[03:17:00]  I forget what it's called.  Larva cheese or something?  Basically, it's hopping with maggots.  Wow.  And you figure, if there's maggots crawling through my cheese, and people are happily  eating it, you're figuring it better be pretty good.  Right?  Yeah, I've heard it is absolutely delicious.  If you're a brie kind of guy, or you're a soft cheese kind of guy, it's got the tinge  to it, and they ban it.  It's more like if you leave a blue cheese in your fridge a little too long, and it's 
[03:17:30]  got that ammonia stank on it.  It's more like that.  So you better like your strong cheeses and not mind bugs hopping on your face.  But it is pretty good.  Do they smear the maggots on their crackers?  Oh yeah, it goes right on.  Why don't they just pull the maggots out?  It goes right on.  They're tiny.  What do you be picking?  You want to be picking like...  So you're eating...  There's lots of them in there.  Best part.  So you're eating the maggots.  Maggot cheese.  There you go, fellas, and I'll hang up the litter.  Of course you do.  Thank you.  Thank you, Greg.  There you go.  Whatever, Frank.  Rambling on.  Frank Bill, Steve?  I don't know.  Anyway.  I want to know for you who we're picking for UFC this weekend. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah, who's fighting?  Who's fighting?  Did you see the end?  Jones versus Teixeira.  Wait, wasn't Jones supposed to come in?  What happened with that?  I don't know.  Where are you supposed to have Jon Jones in?  That's right.  I forgot Jon Jones.  It's Jones versus Teixeira.  It's...  Gotta go Jones.  Mark?  Yeah.  Saturday, I'm sure.  It's Mark Miller.  Wait, is this the first time Jones is fighting since the toe?  Not Mark Miller, I'm sorry.  Pardon me?  Since the toe?  When he broke that toe sideways?  Might be, right?  No, the last one was a Gustafson fight.  Oh, right.  That fucking five rounds.  Which was close. 
[03:18:30]  That's the toughest one he's had.  Yeah, it's going to be exciting.  I'm going.  I'm very, very, very, very excited.  You see Verdum kick the shit out of Travis Brown five rounds.  Now it's going to be Verdum, Cain Velasquez for the heavyweight.  Wow.  Verdum is a nasty, nasty jujitsu guy.  Who else is fighting?  I'm totally blanking.  I really don't know this card.  Phil Davis.  Phil Davis, yeah.  I'm like in the Davis.  Luke Rockhold.  Tim, I don't know how to pronounce his name.  I'm sorry.  Spell it.  B-O-E-T-S-C-H.  Yeah, it's me either. 
[03:19:00]  Yeah, I don't know how that's going to go.  We're a little behind on our UFC.  It's date night in Baltimore for me.  I'm very excited.  How great is it to have a wife that loves UFC?  That's fucking phenomenal.  Yeah, really?  My daughter watches.  I mean, she's been watching since she's four years old.  You know?  Wow.  It's like watching some guy who's completely covered with blood.  He says, I think the man covered in blood is going to lose that out of the video.  The man covered in blood.  That's great.  That's a good follow, though, letting your kid watch that stuff.  I'm being serious.  Well, look, she's learning to fight, as little girls should. 
[03:19:30]  That's good.  Yes, they should, right?  Hey.  We were watching...  I got almost four, and we were watching scary superhero stuff yesterday online.  And I was like, this might be a little too rough.  Like, you know, the Joker, and he took it well.  But, you know, kids are strange, though.  Like, my daughter loved Coraline.  Have you seen this film?  No.  It's terrifying.  Oh, it's terrifying.  I'm watching this thing.  I'm totally creeped up.  My daughter's like, oh, this is really awesome.  That one I turned off.  He was too young. 
[03:20:00]  You know, the alternate parents would be take their eyes out and sew buttons in.  Yes.  Yes.  That one, and it was Frankenweenie, or one of those scary, where everyone's dead in this  cartoon.  I'm like, I don't think he can't watch this yet.  Nightmare Before Christmas.  That one also she loved.  Another one.  That one's kind of cool.  So you never know what's going to totally, you know, traumatize kids.  Got to figure it out as you go, I guess.  Is this that cheese?  I'm looking at a picture of it.  Maggots don't hurt you if you eat them?  No.  Protein. 
[03:20:30]  Next time you come in, we've got to eat some weird stuff, I'm thinking.  Yeah.  Those assholes still reciprocate in time.  Will you hook us up?  I'm sure I can get some of that stuff.  I know people.  You hear this, Jimmy?  What?  We're going to get maggot cheese next time Anthony Bourdain's in.  I don't want that.  And there's a bird called an ortolan.  I think you'd be very interested in, Jim.  What's that?  You'd eat the entire thing.  It's a tiny little bird.  They suffocate it.  What's it shaped like a cock?  They basically drown it.  You sit on it first?  Well, you do put the whole thing in your mouth. 
[03:21:00]  Ah.  How big is it?  First, you drown it about this big.  Okay.  You drown it in Armagnac.  And then you pick it up sizzling hot.  Put it in your mouth with the little head sticking out.  And you crunch down into the boiling hot carapace, crunching through its tiny little bird bones.  There's a hot rush of guts and boiling Armagnac that rushes down your throat.  And as you eat, the little tiny little bones cut your gums so that your blood, your own blood, is actually a component of this flavor. 
[03:21:30]  Okay.  That's going too far.  Traditionally, it was enjoyed when you ate it in a restaurant.  But they'd bring you a hood to put over your head so as not to offend God.  So not to offend God.  Wow.  That's great.  Or gross out your fellow diners.  Exactly.  So I think we could get down on some of that.  It reminds me of my new favorite dessert, which is a log of shit with a hat on it and then marmalade smeared on the other end.  With straight pins shoved in it.  Yeah.  You could get this bird thing in New York?  There's no way you could get that bird.

Oh, yeah, sit down.  I'll get it to you.  We're going to say goodbye to you.  You rule, Bernie.  Bernie.  No.

Sit down.  Oh, my God.  Wait.  He's really mad.  He's mad.  You pissed off Bernie.  All right, get over there.  Get over there.  It's getting hot in here.  It's getting hot in here.  It's getting real hot in here.  Bernie, you don't have to take that.  You don't have to take that, Bernie.

Po, it's okay.  All right, have Bernie sit down.  Bernie, take a seat.  Let's all calm down.  It's all right.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  I didn't even get that fucking CD.  He handed over.  Yeah.  Hand over that fucking CD.  Oh, you're going to have another.  You lunatic.  All right, Bernie. 
[03:35:00]  He's fine, Po.  Tell him to relax.  Po, he's fine.  You tell him to relax.  Yeah, tell him.  Yeah, everyone just relax.  Nobody relax.  All he did was take the CD out.  I mean.  Yeah, fuck you.  Keep the CD.  I won't be here again.  Bernie.  Bernie.  Bernie.  Bernie.  Bernie.  Bernie.  Bernie.  Bernie.  Bernie.  Bernie's leaving.  Oh, man.  Do you got the CD?  Give him his CD.  Oh, you ruined it.  Bring him back in.  Give him his CD.  No, we'll explain what happened.  We'll explain what happened.  Bring him back in.  Bernie.  Bernie.  Come.  Oh, he's going into his back.  Holy shit.  He's going into his back. 
[03:35:30]  No, he's at Bernie.  It's okay.  Bernie, we got the CD.  We got the CD.  All right, Bernie.  Bernie.  Wait.  Sit down.  Sit down.  Sit down.  Sit down.  No, it's 9 o'clock.  Bernie.  Let me explain what happened, though, Bernie.  Let me explain what happened.  Wait.  Put on your headphones.  Let me explain.  We felt like you were a friend of the show that we could pull one of our gags on you.  That's all that was.  It was a joke.  Here's the CD I was smashing.  Okay.  I didn't know that.  Okay.  Bernie, I never touched your CD.  I took this one, and Eric snuck it in and, you know, made the old switcheroo.  Bernie, we still pals? 
[03:36:00]  Things are okay.  All right.  Things are okay.  Yes, I'm glad we had this story.  I'm glad we had this story.  A friend of mine.  I consider you okay or just whatever.  I don't.  Bernie CD.  There you go.  All right, Bernie.  So we're cool.  We're cool.  And anyway, that's the news for the week.  Okay?  Very good.  Bernie gets everybody.  Now that everybody knows what's happening in the world, you know.  I hear you.  Yeah, that was cool in the gang.  That was intense.  Now I know what those guys felt on that subway.  I'll tell you that much.  Oh, boy.  You got mad.  All night and day.  The way he can turn it on. 
[03:36:30]  Yeah.  Taking the subway home.  Everything's cool, Bernie.  Everything is open.  Shut the fuck up.  We're going to be like little Fonzies.  What's Fonzie, Bernie?  I don't know.  Cool.  Cool.  Oh, yeah.  That's okay.  All right.  Okay.  Bernie, we didn't watch it.  We didn't watch it.  It's going to be a mild winter.  Mild winter.  We didn't watch it going away mad.  You all right?  All right.  Is that yours?  Oh, you dropped something, Bernie?  All right.  There you go.  Okay.  That looks like the same Steve jacket he was probably wearing back in the night.  Okay, guys.  Absolutely.  All right.  Thank you, Bernie.  Thank you.  Bernie, guys. 
[03:37:00]  We'll talk to you again soon.  Is this Bernie?  Is this yours?  Say again?  Yes, you did.  He was coming back in.  All right.  He's walking out.  Wow, man.  Holy shit.  Wow.  That was legendary.  Dude, that was the rage.  That was what happened on that train.  Oh, my God.  I'm not even kidding.  That was what happened on that train.  We saw it.  They're rich.  And they pee.  But they're done.  Welcome back to the OPN Anthony Show. 
[03:37:30]  I'm Sirius XM.  I rarely do this, but I had to deal with an idiot on Twitter.  Oh, no.  Sam.  An idiot.  We're talking to Anthony Bourdain.  We are?  The Cronut guy.  We're trying to get some insight on a guy that comes up with this thing called the Cronut.  Although some have argued the Cronut has been around, but he brought it to the masses, this  Cronut, this Dominique Ansel. 
[03:38:00]  And we're amazed and we're obsessed, certainly I am, that the guy isn't making more Cronuts  and that he's not capitalizing on the fact that he brought the Cronut to the masses.  It's all over the world now.  It's all over the world.  So we were kind of asking Anthony Bourdain how much you think he makes.  And Anthony Bourdain said he makes very little.  So then I said, so what do you mean, a couple hundred thousand dollars? 
[03:38:30]  So this asshole on Twitter, XX860XX, the guy says he probably makes very, very little  money.  And then Opie says, what, a couple hundred thousand?  Oh, it's the context of the whole fucking thing, you idiot.  Oh boy.  If you invented or brought the Cronut to the masses, to the world, you should be a multi-millionaire  because of that.  So when Anthony Bourdain said he's making very little, I dropped the numbers thinking, oh, 
[03:39:00]  only a couple hundred thousand, meaning that that's not a lot of money considering what  he did.  Right.  Yeah.  I can't take fucking dummies.  Especially if you're running a business in New York City.  It doesn't mean, oh yeah, and a couple hundred thousand in New York, by the way, yes, thank  you, Anthony.  But Bourdain said it's even less than that.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm not saying that a couple hundred thousand dollars isn't a lot of money, you stupid fuck! 
[03:39:30]  But we do think that it's not a lot of money.  God, it's so frustrating.  Of course a couple hundred thousand dollars is a lot of money.  It's in your bag of shells, but...  To those little peasants out there.  To you dirt lickers.  You know those companies that are making millions of dollars because of what Dominic Ansell brought  to the masses.  That's my point here.  And Dominic said, screw the money, I'm okay with making a hundred, two hundred thousand.  It's probably not even that. 
[03:40:00]  Right.  But we all want more money, right?  More, more, more.  Thank you.  Bring it on.  I rarely have to, like, you know, because I just understand people listen with half  an ear or something.  They're just fucking idiots.  Half an ear?  Like, uh, what was the guy that has half an ear?  Evander Holyfield?  Uh, well, he does.  Who else?  Who are some of those other...  Tiny ear.  Who are some of those other half-ear guys?  Mick Foley? 
[03:40:30]  Oh, Mick Foley's got half a ear.  Who was born with the half-ear?  Oh, uh, uh, Paul Stanley.  Paul Stanley?  Paul Stanley.  Paul Stanley, too.  What about him?  He's got that little half an ear or no ear on one side or something.  I don't know.  He's got a fake one or something, right?  Yeah.  But he's lucky because he got to grow his hair long, most of his life.  That's true.  Uh, let's say hi to Gaylord.  Oh.  The Gaylord, Boston.  What's up?  What's up, Ant?  Oh.  Lord of the gay. 
[03:41:00]  Hello?  Hey.  Hey, my first name's Gaylord.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah.  I said hi, Gaylord.  My last name's Peck-a-Lick-a.  Oh, yeah.  This guy's good.  Shit.  You got us.  Rope this right in.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  I love his chip.  Thanks, Gaylord.  Bye.  We got Sebastian Bach coming in in a few minutes, so.  Oh, yeah?  That'll be good, too.  What's he working on? 
[03:41:30]  There's a new, uh, I think new CD.  Oh, yeah.  Someone on Twitter.  Reasonable?  Said that the Today Show apologized for Joan Rivers' jokes about the Cleveland Brits.  Fucking cowards.  Not Joan Rivers apologizing.  Right.  According to Twitter, maybe we can find the clip, a guy was just on the Today Show to apologize  for what Joan Rivers said.  Joe, we apologize.  If anyone was offended, we certainly would not, here at the Today Show, make light of  such a trap. 
[03:42:00]  Blah, blah, blah.  The blob.  Oh, shut up.  How about instead of doing that, you explain the comedy to your audience?  Holy shit.  I would love to find that clip if someone down the hall maybe could try to find it.  That would be great.  Sam had it, and then he got rid of it.  Oh, you had it, Sam?  Could we go, do you think this country could go, like, one day without someone saying something  on some medium somewhere that offends someone to the point where it has to be addressed? 
[03:42:30]  Or apologizing.  One day without an apology.  Or apologizing.  Yes, without some, oh, oh, we here at the Today Show, and they never describe what it was.  Yesterday, you may have heard something that's always very vague.  We heard a segment yesterday that some people were...  Some of you might have been offended.  Offended.  We here at the Today Show want to give our utmost, sincerest apology. 
[03:43:00]  They love the word condone.  We do not condone.  Condone what Mrs., Mrs., Miss Rivers said on this very program yesterday that we're not going to repeat here, certainly.  We would never, ever make light of the tragic circumstances of the girls put in the tiny little house by the evil man.  God, what a fucking country of groveling, worms, nibbling. 
[03:43:30]  We really need some adversity here.  I mean, we really do.  We got a little piece of it with 9-11.  Who dat?  We got some adversity there.  That was DDP.  DDP!  Who's that?  He's the, we watched him on Nancy Grace.  He's the wrestler that Nancy Grace roped in.  I didn't see that.  Diamond Dolls?  Diamond Dolls.  That was really him? 
[03:44:00]  Yeah, DDP Yoga in the house.  We don't want to talk to him.  She's great.  In the fucking house.  Love Nancy Grace.  As David Cain would say.  You see what's going on down there at the 9-11 Museum?  Yes, the Muslims are upset.  Apparently there's a film, a part of the museum exhibit where you go in and they give you a little, a quick six or seven minute film.  It gives you a little background on Al-Qaeda, who were the perpetrators of the evil doings on 9-11. 
[03:44:30]  Well, there's this consortium of religious people and others that think the film is incendiary and it's just a little too insensitive to Muslims.  Fuck you.  But that's the country we live in.  Yes, it is.  They bombed the fucking buildings.  They killed 2,500 people, whatever it is.  And we don't want to make them look bad.  But I don't think we're going to listen to that. 
[03:45:00]  I think that's going to go through it.  No, but it's amazing how many people agree with this fact that it's incendiary.  They were Islamists and the word jihad is what, hey, dumb motherfucking clerics, we say that they did it for jihad because they claim that's why they did it.  Right.  People who are committing these murders are saying they do it for Allah and jihad.  We don't make that up.  They tell us and we say it and then we're bad guys.  Yeah, their whole thing is like, I don't think a seven-minute film can truly show the motives behind that. 
[03:45:30]  Because you know why?  Yeah.  Because you can't put the guilty American viewpoint of we made our own bad hat.  We have to lay in it.  Kind of take that a lot of these liberal douchebags want to dump on it.  Yeah, society, we didn't get the twatty root cause, how it's really our fault deep down.  Of course. 
[03:46:00]  They don't have hatred.  We force them to have hatred.  Nothing to do with them or their religion.  It's everybody else.  That 9-11 fever lasted for a very short period of time where we actually had some clarity of thought.  And when you walked around New York City and were smelling the fires and looking at the wreckage,  it didn't matter if somebody told a fucking off-color joke.  That wasn't the biggest thing in your fucking life that day or that month or, you know, the year that followed even. 
[03:46:30]  That wasn't the big issue.  We weren't sitting there coddling Muslims.  That's for fuck sure.  And, you know, now, hey, Jenny Hut, your little henna head.  Oh, God, she was so needy.  Yeah.  She is.  She just tweeted about us.  Hey, Jenny.  Hi, Jenny Hut.  I don't like you these days.  I don't know what it is.  I really didn't like you at first.  And I didn't find you attractive or anything.  Oh, God, help me.  And now I'm like, there's something about you. 
[03:47:00]  When your tweet pops up in that picture of you.  Oh, I'm so sad.  Where you're sitting on your ass and your feet are up and I can see fucking where that gush is.  Oh, no.  And.  I see it.  No.  That's really awful.  Fiery red mane down there.  Can we talk about that?  Oh, yeah.  Let's talk about your.  That news conference with the camel toe.  That giant camel toe thing.  Oh, that was fucking great.  Oh, my viral video?  Sure we did.  Yeah.  It was genius.  I can't believe that they did that.  Isn't that correct?  They just lowered the camera.  Well, she didn't. 
[03:47:30]  She's an eyewitness and she didn't want her face on camera because she was scared.  She wanted her labia.  So they.  Whale eye difference.  So the cameraman just panned down and filmed the fucking camel toe.  Wow.  It's beautiful.  Is that what you used to look like?  Yeah, I know.  So I.  A chubby little gal.  Aw.  Aw.  Look at you.  You're a little anchor.  It was not.  Yeah.  I can't.  That girl gives blowjobs.  Did people say.  She has a pretty face.  Yeah, my whole life.  It was awful.  She has such a pretty face.  Why does she do that?  How many blowjobs did you give because you were fat?  Wow.  Jesus. 
[03:48:00]  By the way, that's not a true statement.  You are not.  No, because the truth is when you're very insecure.  I was not slutty because I was insecure.  Oh, man.  You could have been.  Yeah.  You were built.  You were built for slut.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  But you're.  You were probably a better fuck back then because fat girls definitely will fucking rock  your world.  I had a bigger booty.  And a bigger booty.  But whatever.  Did you snag that husband of yours when you were a chunky?  I did.  I was like 30 pounds heavier.  How the fuck did that?  The guy's beautiful.  So that means.  I give a good blowjob. 
[03:48:30]  That means he was poor when he met you.  No, my husband's.  He was poor, wasn't he?  He's.  He saw that Jenny Hut money.  Yeah, that's it.  By the way.  By the way, in all fairness, being married to me, it would be worth it.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm not easy to live with.  Oh, you're not?  No.  Wow.  You were fat and miserable.  No, but I'm fun.  Hold on.  What did your singles add say?  Fat, cranky girl.  She's victim.  There's a cat.  You so gave up the shitter, man. 
[03:49:00]  Listen, guys, I haven't.  I have not.  Wow.  It's still a conversation in my house.  Whoa.  Nice.  Oops.  With the workers that come in.  Yeah, that's it.  But listen, there's a guy who's here.  I just tweeted to the two of you.  I saw you need to.  Charity Buzz, right?  Like three grand to come to Sirius XM and quote unquote meet me.  Wow.  Come to find weight that he really loves the two of you much more than he loves me.  There's three of us here. 
[03:49:30]  I swear it's true.  Which two?  Because there's three of us here.  Well, those two.  I mean, I love you.  Sam Roberts, too.  But I do like that during your bumper that they always say you guys on Twitter are Opie  Radio, Anthony Cumia, and Jen Norton.  So you have top billing.  Not if certain people who were involved in this channel had their way.  But thank God the guys have shown friendship and loyalty.  Where is this guy?  He's here.  He's waiting.  Why don't we close the curtains?  I don't want him.  I don't want him.  Exactly.  Please take a look at the curtains. 
[03:50:00]  Thank you, Sam.  He's so nice.  Thank you.  No.  Oh, really?  He's so sweet.  Why don't you get a cab?  Look, go to the fucking river and jump.  Oh, Sam's closing the curtains.  That's right.  Close the curtains.  He shouldn't be fucking gazing in on Opie.  Yeah, we don't need those starstruck pupils distracting me from my jokes.  So I have to tell you, because Anthony and I live relatively close to each other, I find  myself...  Oh, yeah.  I know, right, Opie?  How do you know where to live?  I find myself thinking sometimes, because I'm getting stuff for my family.  I'm like, oh, I wonder if Anthony orders pizza from here. 
[03:50:30]  I wonder if Anthony goes to this grocery store.  Do you go to Vincent's?  In Huntington?  No.  That one?  Stop enunciating perfectly.  Where we live?  No, we don't go to Vincent's.  Grocery store.  We go to somewhere with an A.  Oh.  There's two different ones with an A.  I know which one I think you're talking about.  Is there an NP after it?  Yeah, one on the main drag.  I go by, you know, by the wall bombs over there.  Uh-huh.  Oh, that Vincen's.  Yes, it's a good one.  That's a good one, and then there's a Petco in there for all our young Beavis' little knees. 
[03:51:00]  Oh, nice.  That's right.  And there's a supermarket, and I guess Anne goes there to buy things.  I wouldn't know.  Do you go to the Dirty Bagel store?  The Dirty Bagel store?  No, but there's a liquor store.  That's what she talks about.  It's the synagogue, actually.  She's just really anti-Semitic.  The synagogue.  The Dirty Bagel store.  Oh, is that terrible?  That's very inappropriate, Jenny.  It's a before and after.  It's a before and after of Jenny Hart with the same pose where you're kind of sitting.  But look at that shot.  Her legs are a little akimbo. 
[03:51:30]  I can see where your butt kind of lifts up off the floor a little.  I know where Ant would like to eat.  You slap yourself into some nice fucking shit there, lady.  You know where Ant would like to eat?  Where?  It's in Mississippi in the 1960s.  That's really awful, Jim.  Swim walk.  That's great.  You got it going now?  How's things going over there on my news?  I'm done.  Well, that really sucks.  You mean Nancy Grace?  Yes, I have that in Nancy Grace.  What a pig she is.  She's a pig.  She's not nice. 
[03:52:00]  And now the whole show is out of L.A. now.  I was the only one in New York.  That's okay.  Dr. Drew's out in L.A. now?  Yeah, he's always in L.A., but I was in New York.  Oh, you were in New York?  Yeah.  He didn't fight to keep you?  No, and that's okay.  What did you say to Nancy Grace when you met that capitalized slob?  I said hi.  I said hello.  Was she frigging her clitoris looking at a dead child photo?  No, she actually capitalized on Twitter with it?  No, that wasn't what happened.  Okay.  Oh, okay.  We thought it was.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  This is true.  Oh, man.  That's Dr. Drew. 
[03:52:30]  What a dick.  No, not at all.  Why don't you like Dr. Drew?  I love Dr. Drew.  You want us to attack him?  No, I really...  All right.  Jenny Hut wants our fans...  Yeah.  No, do not.  No, I do not.  What?  I...  No.  You sure?  Yeah, I'm positive.  I'm positive.  And by the way, I love your fans, and I love all of you.  And so, no.  Wait, why are you nodding yet?  Oh, she's nodding yet.  Why are you saying that?  She's not nodding anything.  She's nodding yet.  Come on.  You're acting the paparazzi shots are so bad because he takes the worst pictures.  He does take horrible pictures.  He makes me look like a freaking freak.  Oh, man.  I know. 
[03:53:00]  It's bad, and he thinks it's funny.  You look like the Wendy's girl's mom...  Mom?  Grandmother?  Older sister.  But I know I'm old.  It's okay.  I get it.  No, you're not.  You look great.  Julia Roberts is long in the tooth earlier.  Yeah.  I'm like, we're the same age.  I'm old.  It's okay.  It's fine.  Oh, boy.  What are you going to do?  Look at that, though.  A little bit.  Look at you with your round face.  Right.  Yeah, you look like a big fat lady.  I want to pinch those cheeks and then put my dick between the other ones.  Oh, great.  Thanks for that.  How are you keeping the weight off?  It's been a while now. 
[03:53:30]  Anthony's baby talk.  I did say yesterday you do a good job on the radio.  You did?  Thank you.  There's not many that do.  Thanks.  As far as the females go.  Because they have to play that role of that dumb hole crap.  I like listening to you guys.  Who wouldn't?  Right?  I know.  Right there with you.  Apparently.  Your fans are rabid, amazing, involved, passionate.  Wonderful people.  Literally rabid.  They have radio.  Yeah, they're terrible people.  But I like how you engage with them, Anthony. 
[03:54:00]  You go back and forth.  So do you.  Okay, I can't believe how many Sudokus you send out.  Isn't that crazy?  Yeah, it's awesome.  It's nice.  Why is that awesome?  Give them back.  Who cares?  I've seen the shrines.  I've seen pictures of the shrines.  With the autographed posters, pictures, the Sudokus.  The sticker.  You need something.  The shrine.  You should do, I don't know.  Nudes.  Yeah, nudes.  Nudes would be good.  We got the Today Show apology if you want to hear it.  I do want to hear it.  Did you hear the Joan Rivers thing?  I did, and I was listening to you guys this morning. 
[03:54:30]  What's your point on that?  What's your point on that?  I mean, Joan Rivers has earned her keep in this business, and she was just making a joke.  And I get the sensitivity surrounding that joke, but I...  Stop trying to say nothing.  Look, real life, Jane, thinks it's hilarious.  On Dr. Drew's show, she'd be like, it was outrageous, and I was not happy to hear it, Dr. Drew.  Well, I think those girls were amused.  Yeah.  Listen, it was funny.  Those girls went through a living hell, and I don't think...  George Zimmerman is somehow to blame. 
[03:55:00]  Yes, he is.  So you're sure you want the pest to attack?  I do not want them to touch him.  Please do not.  Do not.  What?  Something in the works?  Something in the pipe?  Everything is...  Yeah, I mean, hopefully things are going to happen.  Your own Sean headline news?  No, definitely not.  Maybe you could be Nancy Grace's sidekick.  You could, like, bring her hay and things to feed on in between takes.  Yeah.  That fucking vulture.  You could bring her abortion burritos to eat.  Yeah.  Devil's imp.  Help her with fucking hashtags. 
[03:55:30]  Yeah.  Help her with hashtags.  He's a dead baby, Nancy.  Quit smiling.  I love you guys.  I wish I could stay in here.  All right.  Bye, Jenny.  Thanks, Jenny.  Will you let the guy wait for you, Chris?  No.  Later.  Later is your wave.  Maybe later.  You can wave the back of our heads on the elevator.  Let me check that out.  It's Jenny Hut on Twitter with two Ts.  I'm not wearing the vest, because I know you've been talking about it.  Let me check that out.  Let's go.  Your boots are all right, man.  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  Do we give her a hard time, you think?  Your stupid fucking aquatic pants.  Aquatic pants. 
[03:56:00]  I don't like her fucking...  She's flippers with those.  Oh, shit.  It doesn't look like a wetsuit.  Yeah.  I like that sexy talk with her.  All right.  You know.  But she, like, demands being treated like that.  She does.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Look at her all fat in that picture.  Do you kind of like her even when she's fat, though?  You know what?  There's something about her.  It got rid of all the wrinkles.  I don't know.  It did.  That's like Botox, that fat.  What does that imply about now?  I don't know.  I don't know.  It's like when you deflate a balloon. 
[03:56:30]  Oh, fuck.  I was right there.  I swear.  I stammered, and you got right in there.  Fuck.  I stupid stammered.  She was chubby.  She was chubby.  A little chubby.  Cute face, though, you know.  Yeah.  I like that hair on her.  That's that Wendy's girl color.  You're looking for that fiery red bush.  The elusive fiery red bush.  Right.  Got to find it.  So the Today Show had to apologize for Joan Rivers.  I rubbed my fingers together like Indiana Jones did before he took the gold head off the pedestal. 
[03:57:00]  Yeah.  When I see a fiery red bush, I'm like, ah, just ready to fucking dig in.  You really like the fiery red bush, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  It's because it's so elusive.  Freckled lips.  Freckled lips.  Yeah.  It's like that maggot cheese that Bourdais was talking about.  I'm not looking for a Ronald McDonald red.  Okay.  I like a nice auburn.  Yeah.  I like a nice reddish, but, you know, you could tell it's because I'm brown in the air kind of thing. 
[03:57:30]  You know?  Well, here's the Today Show.  Joan Rivers gets very funny on their show, and what does the Today Show do?  They have to apologize the next day.  What'll do you do?  Instead of explaining to their viewers that she's a comedian and she's going to tell some jokes,  and that doesn't mean she doesn't care about what happened to those three young ladies in Cleveland.  We're just not acknowledging it at all.  It's part of what happened on the show, and it doesn't need to be acknowledged. 
[03:58:00]  Let it be.  It's just there.  But they had to do this.  We got a little bit of housekeeping here.  We want to talk about something that happened on the show on Tuesday.  Joan Rivers was a guest on this program.  This is embarrassing.  Should we apologize?  Should we apologize?  Fucking groveling twats.  What the?  There's just groveling, insincere twats.  Groveling.  You can't do an entertainment show, then.  You're not allowed to.  No.  Rivers was a guest on this program.  During our interview, she made a comment at the expense of the Cleveland kidnapping victims. 
[03:58:30]  They have asked her for an apology.  As of this morning, Joan has not given one.  We regret her comment was made on our air deeply and truly.  I hope our reactions in real time show the way we felt about that.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Did you see us?  Did you see us?  The way we reacted?  Who was that?  We didn't laugh.  It's Willie Geis who I like.  He was on MSNBC.  And I thought, I had hope for the guy.  But obviously, he's getting fucking knocked down to be just like the rest of these fuckers. 
[03:59:00]  Good for him.  He'll do well.  Yeah, of course.  He will.  He'll make millions and millions of dollars, you know, just doing it their way.  But he fucking, he doesn't believe in shit.  By the way we reacted.  Just to bring that up.  Like, look, look at the replay.  We were good.  We were very like, oh.  No one laughed.  None of us.  Oh, that's terrible.  Right.  Oh, it's turning.  On our air deeply and truly, I hope our reactions in real time show the way we felt about her  attempted joke, if you want to call it that. 
[03:59:30]  This is, if you want to call it that.  Oh, God, girl, it was a joke.  You know it was a joke.  You know it was a joke.  If you want to call it that.  That's exactly what she was doing, was telling a joke.  And you know that.  Come on, man.  Wow.  The Today Show fucking stinks.  If you could call it that.  It was a joke.  It was a joke.  Flat out.  And you know exactly what she was going for when she said that.  Holy shit.  On our air deeply and truly, I hope our reactions in real time show the way we felt about her 
[04:00:00]  attempted joke, if you want to call it that.  This is a live broadcast every day.  We can't control what our guests say.  Then shut up about it.  Joan's been a guest on Today many, many times, but we absolutely do not condone what  she said here this morning.  Oh, my God.  I hope it was clear at the time.  We'll make it clear again.  We obviously didn't find it funny.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  How many?  And you hear the hands in the background?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What he's saying, I agree, too.  And they used the word. 
[04:00:30]  Yeah.  They used condone.  I told you.  A condone.  They loved the condone.  How many fucking times is he going to grovel here?  Listen for the yes.  I hope it was clear at the time, and we'll make it clear again.  Yes.  We obviously didn't find it funny.  We didn't approve of it.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  All right.  Heartfelt apologies to the Cleveland kidnapping because as well.  No question.  All right.  Let's go check out the weather now.  You know what?  Don't do entertainment, then.  Just please don't do it.  Let's go to the weather.  Not capable of doing it.  I want to apologize, too.  I've put a sad face on the weather map today to show that I'm very sad of the reaction. 
[04:01:00]  Al Roker goes to Rose.  We've seen him at Rose.  He understands humor, and he understands that it can be brutal at times.  Don't say a so-called joke.  It was a joke.  Oh, God.  Really fast.  Let's say hi to Jeff in Brooklyn.  Jeff.  Fucking, I just, I don't understand what the big fucking deal is with these people.  Who gives a shit? 
[04:01:30]  I would be fucking thrown off of any sort of public television show for the shit that  comes out of my mouth.  I don't understand it.  Come.  Right.  Unnecessary.  Why?  Fucking who gives a shit?  Fucking everything's so PC.  It's retarded.  Ah, retarded.  Hey.  Don't say retarded, please.  We don't condone that whatsoever.  At the Opie and Anthony show, don't condone that.  And we want to apologize profoundly and profusely and proly. 
[04:02:00]  Proly.  Sure.  I don't even know what.  That's just disgusting.  He kept having it.  That's it.  And that's up to Joan Rivers.  If she wants to apologize, whatever.  It's not up to you guys.  That's a so-called joke.  So-called joke.  That was the one that drove me nuts.  The chicken was indeed trying to cross the road for other reasons than getting to the  other side.  So we apologize to the chicken or anyone offended.  Any chicken Americans that might be offended by that joke.  That so-called joke. 
[04:02:30]  So-called joke.  That so-called joke.  Actually, you would not put Velcro on the ceiling.  We would like to apologize for that so-called joke.  Actually, you can't slice somebody that thin to fill potholes.  So we want to apologize for that so-called joke.  That's embarrassing.  Sebastian Bach is here.  Where is he?  I don't know.  We're a nation of fucking hypersensitive babies who need jokes explained to us because 
[04:03:00]  we take them literally now and we would like the apology.  Yeah.  I don't agree with that, Jimmy.  I don't think we're a nation of that.  There's a small minority of people that are that.  And for some reason, we cater to all those people.  I don't get it.  Then we're guilty of catering to them.  Of course.  I think you're right.  But we are guilty of it.  I don't think it's the majority.  I don't think it's even close to the majority.  There's nothing you can do about it, though.  I think if the masses of people that actually didn't care actually got together and showed  that they didn't care, it would be amazing. 
[04:03:30]  Duck Dynasty.  Proof that you can say something that a lot of people don't like and more people are okay  with it.  Right.  And you get back on TV.  Always more people will be okay with it than not.  Always.  Way more.  Way more people would be okay with it.  But for some reason.  Or at least not care.  That anyone said.  And it goes back to your point.  It fucks entertainment up.  Yeah.  The children angle is relevant here as well because now the people that don't give a fuck  that Joan Rivers did that and probably really enjoyed that are not going to be able to hear 
[04:04:00]  that type of stuff on the Today Show because they are catering to the minority.  You know, you're a very small minority.  The number of people that actually enjoy the joke, it isn't even just them.  It's the people that don't give a fuck.  That's the vast majority of people that don't care.  But you add them into the number of people that did enjoy the joke, and you got a fuck  a lot of people that think protesting it or having to apologize is ridiculous.  Right.  Re-god-damn-diculous. 
[04:04:30]  With that, we say hi to Sebastian Bach.  Sebastian.  He's coming in now.  Come on in there, Sebastian.  What's up, Sebastian?  Hey, man.  Take a seat.  Pull up the mic.  Looking good, sir.  We're cranking.  How are you?  We're right in.  What's up, brother?  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  What's up, man?  Well, I just remember like three years ago, and you came in, and I came in to this exact  chair.  You were sitting right there.  You were sitting right there.  Yeah.  And you go, I can't believe I'm holding a CD. 
[04:05:00]  It's like a typewriter.  Right.  And then here we are three hours later.  Three hours.  Three hours.  It's like an idiot.  It's like going back to your old...  Three years later, and I got a new CD.  Yeah.  We're like going back to your old high school.  We just stay fucking here.  That's wild.  And you travel the world, and then you come back.  Well, isn't Sirius XM such a kind of like...  I mean, like, if you got it, that's all you listen to, and it's like your whole world. 
[04:05:30]  Right.  But it's like a world, you know?  Yeah, because you can kind of go from 60s, 70s, 80s...  Yeah, I always listen to the 70s channel.  Do you like the 70s channel?  I love the 70s channel.  The 70s channel is pretty good.  The singing.  It's the singing that I love.  Yeah, see.  They knew how to sing back then.  The harmonies, the Eagles, Steely Dan.  This is quality singing.  A lot of harmonies.  I do love that.  Except for Get Over It by the Eagles.  We hate that song.  Oh, yeah, that's not a good one, is it?  Get over it.  Quit your bitching and your moaning and your fighting and your lying. 
[04:06:00]  Get over it.  That's not, that's not, that's not, we've been on a dark visit highway.  That's a different era.  We saw the Eagles documentary and we loved it, but then they had to do the whole Get Over  It.  I love that documentary.  It was amazing.  That is...  I didn't know they were backups for Linda Ronstadt.  Who knew that?  Well, who knew that Joe Walsh, the greatest quote, he goes, if I was awake, I was doing  that shit.  Right.  And I was like, whoa, okay. 
[04:06:30]  Man, yeah.  Like, okay, you're awake, fucking, I'm awake.  Amazing.  What do you think, what do you think, the 70s or 80s, there was more partying going  on on the road?  I have to come back to the classic Dennis Leary skit where he goes, he goes, what the fuck?  He goes, John Lennon, George Harrison, James Brown, the greats, leave us, leave this earth,  leave us without their art. 
[04:07:00]  You put Motley Crue in a fucking room with 15 pounds of blow.  They come out, two weeks later, what the fuck?  Let's rock!  Let's rock!  Let's rock!  Let's rock!  John Lennon, gone too soon.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  Mick Mars, let's fucking go.  Still ready to go.  He's indestructible, Mick Mars.  He's fucking indestructible.  So I don't care.  He's hanging in there.  No, we're lucky to be alive, you know.  A lot hardier of a group, I think, the 80s. 
[04:07:30]  More coke, right?  As far as drugs went.  Well, just the norm back then was Jack Daniels and blow.  That was like normal.  Jesus.  Standard.  Jack and blow.  If you're not doing that, like...  Right, right.  You know, I do Jack and I go to jail immediately.  Like, do not pass go.  Do not collect 200 bucks.  You're going to jail.  You were doing it back in the day.  Tons.  I remember one of the worst moments I knew this wasn't good was when we played, like, 
[04:08:00]  C&E Stadium in Toronto.  The Normo Dome.  Yes.  And we had so much blow.  We had so much blows.  Guns and roses.  Yeah.  Just couldn't even fucking...  Because it was crazy.  And so, listen to what we thought was a good idea.  Decided to go go-karting.  There you go.  I like 11 or 12 of it.  In the next day, we've been up all night, right?  Because that's fucking great.  Yeah, why not?  We're all high.  And then, I think it's funny to turn the go-kart around and go opposite on the track against 
[04:08:30]  dads with kids and shit.  It's funny.  It's going...  We're go-karting!  We're on tour!  Kids are going...  Wow.  Jesus.  And then I look back, I go, don't...  You know.  Yeah, yeah.  That's getting a little nuts.  Keep the go-kart going in the same direction now.  Let's at least do that.  As the family.  Yes.  Hour. 
[04:09:00]  Did you ever stay up all night and then do a show the next night without sleeping?  I don't know.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  I haven't slept a lot right now because I'm on a crazy schedule.  I have a new record out called Give Him Hell.  Yes.  I'm playing tonight in New York City.  So, let's get that out of the way.  Where are you playing?  Oh, man.  B.B. Kings.  Oh, nice.  But, um, do you remember?  Here's a story maybe I shouldn't tell because I, when I'm tired, I don't give a fuck what  I say. 
[04:09:30]  That's good.  Yeah.  That's great.  Give him the mic.  That's cool.  That's our job.  So, oh, God.  Look at this.  This is a CD.  That's so weird.  That was only three hours ago.  It looks cool, man.  Do you remember the night, do you remember the show where Axl, um, like, beat up the city  of St. Louis?  Yes.  Was there a riot?  He jumped in the crowd and started throwing. 
[04:10:00]  Yes.  Yeah, he was very angry at somebody down there.  Right before we were fucking, we were at a strip club in, um, St. Louis and, and just,  you know, up the whole time and, and, you know, yeah, that was one of those nights.  Were you up all night, do the show the next night?  Yeah.  What was it like to be in the 80s with Axl Rose at a strip club in St. Louis?  Oh, my God.  That must have been a fun place.  I could tell you more, but I'm writing a book.  So, dude, don't, you know, it'll be an Anthony's book. 
[04:10:30]  Yeah, huh?  Yeah.  Did you guys get along?  You and Axl?  Yes.  Yes.  You're still good friends, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He, he, you know.  Did the girls want to dance for you, too, in the, in the strip club?  Imagine.  How annoying was a regular customer?  When you're a regular fucking Joe that just left his job to go to the strip club and maybe  get a little attention from the girls and fucking Sebastian.  That's all 12 of them.  It's like, fuck you.  Just shish the body women.  Hey, my dollar not good enough for you, bitch. 
[04:11:00]  He left a fat one for that guy.  Actually, you know what?  When you're that into the blow, when you're that into the blow, that can, one time we were  in Germany at a, at a whorehouse.  And, um, it was a very ornate, beautiful Victorian building in like Cologne or something.  And the promoters, it was a big fucking deal.  These whores were expensive.  But me and Duff were, we just wanted to blow.  We didn't give a fuck. 
[04:11:30]  And we were down in the basement.  Like, there's like a hot tub.  I love it.  And then there's like a, like the, the heating ducts and the, and like the, all the guts of  the building and shit.  And we're like, where's the fucking blow?  And all these chicks are all over.  We're like, where's the blow?  And then all these chicks are like, no.  Yeah.  And we were in a hot tub.  I remember we were like pretty much nude.  And, uh, steam is everywhere.  Somebody comes up and gives us a blow.  We ran out of the hot tub because we didn't want to get it like, you know. 
[04:12:00]  Not the steam is fucking all off.  Yeah, we couldn't get that away.  So then we're like in the fucking closet in the, in the, you know, on the heating duct.  Yeah.  In lines and all these chicks are waiting for us.  We didn't give a fuck.  Keep those naked chicks away from us.  They'll just take our blow.  But I remember thinking, what is wrong with us?  Why would we be in?  Nothing.  You were working exactly like a human being on blow should have operated.  That's right.  I want more blow.  Two men in the closet just talking to a mop before fucking naked girls are waiting. 
[04:12:30]  Yeah, exactly.  But there comes a time when the blow just freezes you up.  You know, like when you, when you first start doing it, it's like the greatest thing ever.  You talk about everything.  Everything's great.  And then you do the lines like.  It's okay.  It's okay.  It's like, what the fuck are we doing?  What, what happened to this drug?  God, if you get me through this one, I'll never do it again. 
[04:13:00]  Or you run out, you're lying until the sun's up and you can't sleep and you pray to the Lord.  I swear.  If you just let me go to sleep, I'll never do this again.  I will be the best human being that I can be.  I gotta sleep.  Would you please?  Is there a worse feeling than that?  No, and you got a gig that night, too.  And your brain's just, you can't sleep.  Do you know how much sleep I need to sing 18 life? 
[04:13:30]  Jesus Christ.  Wow.  I gotta hit some notes here, God.  Yeah.  I need a nappy.  What time, if you're trying to fall asleep and you couldn't fall asleep, would you look  at the clock and finally go, fuck it, I'm actually staying up?  Oh, this is the worst feeling in the world.  It's terrible.  Horrible.  You know, you gotta learn to just destroy the clock.  Oof, right.  You know, get rid of the clock.  Jeez.  It's a weird scene.  Yeah, when it's 10 in the morning and then it's noon and you're like, oh boy.  Here we go.  I'm not gonna sleep, I don't think. 
[04:14:00]  Well, you know the funniest thing, when I was Jekyll and Hyde on Broadway, the more haggard  and fucked up I would get as Mr. Hyde, it would work for the role.  And they'd go, he's fucking good.  I'd be like, I saw that with you, and that was great, man.  Is he ever good?  He's loaded.  Out of my mind.  It was fucking great.  And SFX is like, he's a good actor, he's played Jesus.  And I didn't say anything.  And the guy's like, yeah, that's right, I'm acting. 
[04:14:30]  That was an amazing show.  I saw it through.  Yeah, that was a good one, man.  That was good.  I would love to do it again.  You get any more Broadway after that?  I actually almost just did.  They have this crazy production of Jesus Christ Superstar with Johnny Rotten.  Holy shit.  Have you heard about this?  No.  Johnny Rotten and the guy from Incubus or something.  I know it's weird, but I was supposed to be in that, but it didn't work out.  Jesus or Judas?  Who are the best songs? 
[04:15:00]  Heaven on Their Minds is the best song.  Judas.  The devil always gets the best songs.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  My new album's called Give Him Hell.  That's right.  In stores now.  Nice.  That carries CDs, so, like, one store in, like, Omaha.  It's almost silly to have CDs printed, smashed in.  You know, you can go right across the street and get it at Tower Records.  No, you can't, actually.  There's no more records.  There's no more records.  It's all iTunes and download, but it saves the overhead.  Yeah, it's cool.  You know, you fucking pay less to have it all done. 
[04:15:30]  Yeah.  It is really amazing when you think of the amount of record stores there used to be.  And the size of them, like Tower or the big chains.  You'd go in and you couldn't even look at all the merchandise that was there.  And then all of a sudden it seemed like overnight, boof!  We don't need this shit.  I remember one Christmas I was at a mall in New Jersey, Monmouth Mall, and I can't  remember, Sam Goody's.  Sam Goody.  Can't even remember the name, right?  Goody's got it.  And I remember all the people buying the cash register were pissed. 
[04:16:00]  Like, fuck this industry.  This is bullshit.  Nobody's buying these fucking things anywhere.  I'm staring at it going, oh, man.  Like, they're yelling and mad and all that.  It sucks.  It really, it happened very quickly.  Was Tower the first one to just ship the bed, Tower Records?  Was that the first one that made it want to go down?  You know, remember the one down here in New York?  Virgin Megastore?  Yeah.  That was killer.  You could get lost in those stores.  Yeah, it was great. 
[04:16:30]  I mean, it comes down to the basic difference.  When we were kids, you had to, you know, you had seven bucks.  Yeah.  And you'd work, you'd cut lawns, or you'd deliver papers, or you'd work for that seven dollars.  Yeah.  You'd go to the record store.  You'd spend all day in there looking at everyone going, which one am I getting?  You had a decision.  And it was really important.  It was.  And you'd cherish that motherfucker. 
[04:17:00]  I cut lawns for this.  Now that you're a kid, you press a button, you get every single song ever created by  humans in the history of mankind, ever in the history of rock.  For free.  For nothing.  For free.  Yes, on your phone.  On your phone.  Oh, this is great.  That's it.  How do you...  Jimmy was talking the other day.  Walking down the street, and you just think of something like, oh, that song I want.  Boom, boom, boom.  And now you have it.  You got it.  Now you just have it.  It took...  You had to figure out how to get to the fucking record store. 
[04:17:30]  I know.  You're kidding me.  Mom, mom, can you drive me?  Come on, mom.  But it's Boston.  So how do you guys make your money then?  Well, did you see Bette Midler posted a tweet where she got a check from Pandora?  Pandora.  She got 4,600,000 plays, and she got 128 bucks.  Wow.  And that's on her Twitter. 
[04:18:00]  She posted, and I was like, wow, dude.  4,000,000 plays, 128 bucks.  Wow.  Killer.  Rock and roll.  This is great.  Wow, man.  You see, you guys must hate Spotify and all this.  I heard they fuck the artists, too.  They don't give the artists money.  Well, you know what I don't like is the sound quality.  Like, you spent, like, a new record right here, Gim Hell, spent over six figures making this  fucking thing, right?  And you get it tweaked in the studio so it's like Star Wars. 
[04:18:30]  Like, it's insane.  Like, you can't, and then you email it to somebody or upload it and download it.  It's like, and you got to think, no, listen, this really does sound good if you would ever  be able to actually hear it.  Yeah.  You know, it's like getting what you make to the fans is like a maze of 98 KBS or 128 K or 
[04:19:00]  three.  I go, what the fuck?  Just fuck with.  It's endless, like, YouTube and fucking.  You're falling asleep on the couch in the studio listening to the same bass line just  to get the fucking thing.  Yes.  Like, tweets perfectly.  And it's like, now I'll just, I'll pretty much beam it to somebody like Star Trek.  We'll tear it apart, send it digitally onto some fucking.  And put on those little iPhone things and that'll be perfect because those sound great.  And it's like, why are we spending all this money? 
[04:19:30]  Why fucking bother?  Maybe it'll fly all the fans to the studio so they can hear it one time.  A lot of people call and someone wants to know if you ever partied harder than when  you were on tour with Pantera in the early 90s.  Well, those guys really loved drinking.  Each band's had their, like, it was not a lot of blow at all with Pantera, if any, actually.  It was all booze. 
[04:20:00]  Wow.  With Guns N' Roses, it was coke, like, and booze.  Right.  Yeah, they didn't make mints.  Booze makes it really harder to function like the next day, doesn't it?  You know, I felt like a wimp because I would go and do my warm-up for my show, which consisted  of la-la-la-la-lee-lee-lee-lee-lee.  Lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo.  And then Pantera and Phil go, hey, Burke, come in here. 
[04:20:30]  And he'd line up 48 shots of Crown Royal.  Oh, my God.  Do a couple push-ups and just go...  what is wrong with this picture  you know because every singer is different right yeah and still you gotta figure out your pipes  and what makes them work and stuff yeah and i i some guys just go up there and do it i i have to 
[04:21:00]  work at it to to make it sound the way i want and i was talking about this to axel and and he  and i said yeah you know i do my vocal scales and then i'll like put on some old journey and  i'll sing along with that he goes what and i go i go yeah because it's like high singing he goes  because baz if i had to sing along to old journey records i i wouldn't be doing this  well i i don't know what to tell you i had to when the lights go out that's a good city 
[04:21:30]  chicks dig that i'm telling you oh yeah you you waddle yourself up to the microphone at karaoke and  you belt out the high note and don't stop believing you're yeah you're in you're getting laid that  night do you ever go to karaoke and do it or no i have i have what right when i got divorced that's  just leave the fucking karaoke bar though you you can google it go sebastian bach divorce drunk  you have fucking like i lived at care it seemed that every bar i went to right when i got divorced

[04:23:00]  night of karaoke you gotta sing karaoke yeah it's you know i don't drink anymore but but there is  something unbelievably fun about getting drunk and singing karaoke yeah and it and it's always like  like somebody will come down and be like oh man there's no fucking way you get me up there  and then a couple of drinks  give me a like  they're the one is the lonely  number one 
[04:23:30]  fucking fantastic  but you do it with guns which uh makes it a little special  well it's got a few videos out there where he's doing karaoke with yeah with a 50 cal  because there's a lot of karaoke videos so i was just why don't i sing like a real nice tender  song like uh lionel richie's hello but i'm holding a 50 caliber rifle in my hands you know that's a  good one and uh it yeah mix it up a little bit i'm actually on a new tv show abc tv on may 31st

[04:26:30]  shit sandwich sandwich but um  oh wow it's a it's a funny that sounds cool yeah it's fun i'll check that out that's a very  different angle on it though that's like that is something i would want to see well like i mean  there's prosthetics and like you know maybe maybe maybe if i was to perform as say perchance  freddie mercury maybe they would put some big huge chiclets in my teeth and i'd be out there  going oh mama me mama me i'm mama me and let me call me as a baby 
[04:27:00]  for me 70s porno stash you never know that might happen so or maybe one episode i could  come out as a very tall chick that would be crazy wouldn't it yeah that would be cool would you get  to choose the people you know oh do you have you have you seen online some people that are just  just you wouldn't think they can sing like an artist and then they're like this little girl 
[04:27:30]  that's in england that have you seen that she comes out and just a huge voice yeah crazy the  one i just recently saw there's some chubby mexican dude that fucking sings welcome to the  jungle all right that one was amazing it's like he starts and you're like all right he's just they  dubbed it over it's axel really you gotta see this fucking guy yeah yeah yeah we we'll get that on  but there's a few people that is like you know that and then this uh some tall lanky guy is singing 
[04:28:00]  exactly like uh another artist it really there's some very talented people out there that i think  before youtube just had no outlet well the guy in journey or no yeah yeah they grabbed him up from  the philippines he's in he's in his rice paddy with his ipad and he's a journey like yeah i'm in  journey making 250 an hour right well how much of a steve perry fucking hates that how depressing

[04:42:00]  up coming to the jersey shore i'm doing uh doing ddp over workshop down on the shore so i come into new  york couple days early get a little pr in for ddp yoga and spread the word you're all about it we were  talking me and uh travis who work here we're uh shark tank fans we always and we were talking but  you have to be honest when you did shark tank it was just you weren't looking for money no you just  wanted the commercial you know what i really wanted why i wanted to say all i want is a dollar 
[04:42:30]  that's what i wanted to do because i said let's see the shark fringy turn on themselves yeah yeah  because when they knew the kind of numbers that we were doing i mean we've sold over a hundred thousand  units jesus you know and at that well at that time we were about seventy thousand shark tank is the  greatest thing that happened to your company if you have a real product and you're really ready for  it now you know i've done i when wwe i got to shift over to that because it sort of works together  when wwe did old school raw this year and they brought me on and jake sneak surprise jake roberts 
[04:43:00]  at the end of the show yeah yeah yeah that they let me do a little mini minute and a half infomercial  when i remember seeing it it was just this little quick thing on the call where you were plugging your  thing and i was like this does now vince mcmahon own a part of it usually if you say anything on his  show oh it's his exact dude i've never i get to wear my own shirts i get to wear my own stuff  and it's still because it's the real gimmick and vince likes things that are reality based  and for him to do that for me like it was huge and it had a big result like it shut down that's 
[04:43:30]  the point it shut down my site that's how many people came to the wwe world right or universe wwe  universe so when i went on shark tank knowing that it is shut down people's sites who think they're  ready my my uh president of my company steve you he's really whiz kid he put on 25 servers  wow ready yes we did you're selling some dvds today we did seven figures no over that month 
[04:44:00]  are you talking about units sold or money well i'm talking about i'm talking about money no  after that i'd be retired i was about to say at some point you don't have to wear your own t-shirt  anymore well you know freaking the beach body and all the stuff that you know um right now the hottest  workouts would be p90x and sanity and of course everybody's doing crossfit and they're all beating  the hell out of their bodies which is awesome for me because down the road they're going to need ddp 
[04:44:30]  yoga so ddp yoga made millions of dollars off shark tank we did over it we did it we just we busted  seven you know you busted a million you busted a million just that's incredible that crazy exposure  level there and it was an eight minute you know and the thing is i didn't go there to get the money  even though if if someone like mark cuban came on yeah i would have thought about that just because of  the exposure but and i mean the continual exposure after that but i told them i told shark tank i will  be your first hundred million dollar company i will definitely be your first half a billion dollar 
[04:45:00]  company wow and that's that's how the goals i think it's not about the money it's about the  awareness because we're changing lives with ddp yoga well you you're you're the king right now of  self-promotion i think you put yourself everywhere you don't even work for a wrestling company anymore  and you're everywhere i have to ask you because i only got a couple minutes with you today  i don't have my i've got you know we could talk for why don't we do a call now and you will do a  thing back here on next next week and week after we'll do it but my question right now is you talk  about exposure getting on every tv show you could possibly get on you were on nancy grace and it blew 
[04:45:30]  up it blew up oh god i mean i can't you know i gotta laugh it's just like where you pulled it out  again yeah it was but i you know it was that was like pissed me off so bad that i won't even talk about  that cut because you see the names and i love i love because you that sentence starts sounding  politically correct and ends in a very different direction yeah you know because i just it was just  wrong and you know i i mean i really i'm not going to talk about that fucking cunt anymore because 
[04:46:00]  i'm just not we can hashtag that because she loves her hashtags like yeah because you're sitting  there and we all saw it she's running through first of all you could tell looking at you that  you have been completely bamboozled into being like you right now bitch but don't take out on me  what you wanted to say to her yeah i just i tell you what you know here's a whole different world  you know and there it was just so weird because i that she was so nice to me you know that's the 
[04:46:30]  weird part it was like so nice i was like okay because i was told it was gonna be a whole different  program right you know and uh oh you know it's just something that you know i don't want to be  associated in that way of you know that you know that he was a great man man as far as what he did  for our business talk about the warrior right he did you know and it was very very very sad time for  our business right really the world because so many kids grew up with him man and you must have had  some kind of relationship with the guy because at the hall of fame the ultimate warrior goes up and he 
[04:47:00]  plugs ddp yoga yeah you know he i i talked to him because i didn't get a chance to talk to him the whole  weekend because he was so i didn't want to walk up and you know you know because everybody's pulling  him and i know what that's like and at that level when you're the main event of the hall of fame  right you know it's uh you know it's a big deal and and he's getting pulled a million different ways  so i talked to him the year before when he was at wrestle con and him and hulk were both there and  i was there with jake and uh and um we got you know he he pulled me aside he's like man what you're 
[04:47:30]  doing with scott and you know you know scott and uh jake is you know and he said in his words he  said it was god's work you know i was like man thank you so much because you took the two biggest  uh well the two most well-known junkies in wrestling which is jake roberts and scott hall  and you put them on this ddp yoga plan they both seem they both went into the hall of fame this year  they're both healthy they look healthy they speak healthfully they're not they're both very smart  guys yeah you know and all they did i just guided them you know i just you know i i i i helped them 
[04:48:00]  understand what real food was again you know the biggest thing when someone's having a problem with  an addiction they're going through a lot of pain you know mental and in our case physical you know i  mean uh jake's body was beat up and you know we started a movie called the resurrection of jake the  snake that documentary that we started filming with jake 18 months ago so for us to end up on that stage  because when i first started filming this it's nothing like beyond the mat right it's a story 
[04:48:30]  of redemption and the story of a guy that you know everybody grew up loving but there had to be  moments because you're very public when you're like i'm starting this and if it didn't work that  kills your business you know that's that's what people said i took a real i didn't ever think about  it like that because i know that the business like the disabled veteran arthur borman the guy i helped  walk again you can never take that away right you know and today seven and a half years later  arthur can do shit that that i can't do you know yeah you got guys on your yoga dvd what'd you call it
