<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with a vulgar, promotional introduction referencing sex, race, and disaster.  The hosts immediately launched into a graphic discussion about Christopher Reeve's post-paralysis sex life, complete with sound effects they claimed depicted his sexual activity.  A female caller, Julia, participated in this conversation.  The discussion then shifted to their massive Times Square billboard, with callers describing its size and location, and debating its advertising effectiveness.  One caller mentioned a group of "militant blacks" in Times Square, prompting the hosts to jokingly suggest a prank involving "Vinny the racist."  Callers also discussed the billboard's webcam visibility and potential appearances in film or television.  The hosts promoted their upcoming "teen car wash" and "man boob contest."

Opie then recounted a serious car accident, detailing his injuries (including a severely bruised or broken nose) and the extensive damage to his car. He described how another car, waved into traffic by other drivers, hit his vehicle, sending it 20 feet sideways.  He highlighted the other driver's initial lack of concern and his own initial focus on his injuries.  Callers commented, including a "forensic axontologist" offering humorous advice and a mechanic explaining airbag burns.  Brother Weez, the other driver, called in, admitting his initial thought was "I'm killing Opie" and blaming his hunger for neglecting Opie's passenger, Sandy.  The discussion evolved into a conversation about self-preservation in accidents.  Further calls from listeners who experienced similar accidents underscored the dangers of drivers waving others into traffic.

The show then turned to the fallout from their Stone Pony roadshow in Asbury Park, New Jersey. They discussed negative press coverage, including articles in the Asbury Park Press and on WNEW, detailing allegations of nude wrestling in a pool. The hosts defended themselves, highlighting the show's positive economic impact on the town while contrasting it with the town's existing problems and the negative press, citing accusations of retaliation against the Stone Pony owner for his criticism of the town's handling of a previous "Greek Fest."  They read excerpts from news articles and discussed Asbury Park officials' reactions.  The segment also included a brief, offensive clip from a past "Make-A-Wish" phone call.  Vulgar language and sexually suggestive humor were prevalent throughout, with advertisements for Stacker 2 and GoldenPalace.com.

A significant portion focused on a caller, "Bill" (later "Joe"), who claimed to be able to shoot a substance from his nipples.  A doctor called in to offer a possible medical explanation, leading to a heated exchange with the caller. The show then transitioned to a "man-boob" contest sponsored by a Philadelphia doctor and GoldenPalace.com.  A large contestant, "Assman" (510 pounds), was brought into the studio.  The hosts and intern Rachel engaged in a highly explicit discussion and examination of Assman's body, including graphic descriptions of his genitalia.

The final segment included a graphic description and drawings of Assman's genitalia, with crude analogies used by the hosts and intern Rachel, along with Rick's drawing.  They discussed his urination difficulties. The show then discussed a news story about a hurricane-weakening product, ironically validating a previous outlandish suggestion by former intern "Spaz" ("Spaz Science"). Clips of Spazâ€™s past segments were played.  The hosts announced Metallica's James Hetfield entering rehab.  Listener calls for a "What Did We Learn?" segment followed, along with further promotion of the "Man Boob" contest.  Additional "Spaz Science" clips and a closing advertisement for Pinnacle Horny Goatweed concluded the broadcast.  Commercial breaks featured Sobe beverages and Hotwire travel deals.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hour, hour, hour, hour, hour, by Opie and Anthony, serving New Jersey, Connecticut, Long Island.  This is 1027 WNEW, New York.  Fox News in the studio today, Anthony.  You know, some people call Opie and Anthony vile and obscene.  F*** you!  We took our cameras behind the scenes to reveal the truth about Opie and Anthony.  What we found will shock you.  Shock, shock, shock, shock, shock you.  Sex, race, disaster. 
[00:00:30]  Vulgar show.  Disgusting.  Wrestling.  Unzipping.  Sex, sex, sex.  Vulgar show.  You will grow to adore us.  The Opie and Anthony virus is sweeping the country.  Now we're going to be real.  Prank, prank, prank.  I just sit in my room with a little radio listening to Casey Kasem and people like, you know, people like that.  If you didn't do this, what would you be doing?  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  I was good at caddying.  If you didn't do this, what would you be doing?  Be like gum from underneath the desk for money and stuff. 
[00:01:00]  The Opie and Anthony virus is sweeping the country.  Free to talk about Howard anytime they want.  Yeah.  There's no comparison.  I think, quite frankly, it was funnier.  Howard Stern.  It was funnier.  Free to talk about Howard anytime they want.  We don't need to go on the air and talk about Howard.  Howard, Howard, Howard, Howard Stern.  The Opie and Anthony virus is sweeping the country.  It kind of sucks in.  Opie and Anthony really do have the last laugh. 
[00:01:30]  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  This show is as funny as it gets.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, speaking of sex.  Yeah.  We forgot to talk about Christopher Reeve.  This is a little more information than I wanted.  Christopher Reeve is having sex.  I honestly didn't know that quadriplegics could have sex.  Well, he's been, physically, he's been reduced to pretty much just a head.  Well, now, come on.  He even knows. 
[00:02:00]  You see him with the respirator.  You ever see that episode of Star Trek with Captain Christopher Pike?  That's pretty much what he's like now.  Yeah.  He can talk a little bit.  He's got the respirator going.  But now we're finding out that him and his wife are having sex.  Yeah, but she's saying it's like one-sided.  Obviously.  On what side?  Like, I guess all he can, well, she just mounts him and that's it.  No, I'm not even thinking that much.  I'm thinking, like, maybe oral.  Oh, my God.  From him.  Really?  That's all.  Like, from him. 
[00:02:30]  To her.  But it says in the article he still gets erections.  Do you think she climbs aboard his lifeless body?  Oh, come on.  Come on, man.  No, I'm serious.  You're getting a bit much there.  Oh, honey.  I think it's working.  Oh, come on.  So close that time, honey.  Here. 
[00:03:00]  They don't sleep in the same bed because of all the equipment that he's hooked up to, Anthony?  Yeah.  And this is the most disturbing part of the article in the Post today.  She unhooks all the equipment during sex.  So wait a minute.  Unhooks it all?  He's got to breathe.  So that's probably why, to get his mouth free.  Oh, wow.  So you might be onto something there.  What is she? 
[00:03:30]  Julia, I got a few questions I could ask you.  Julia.  Yeah.  What's going on?  Well, you were just talking about Christopher Reeve, and there's that new Viagra commercial  out, and they show the guy sitting in the wheelchair, so I guess it works for you if  you're in a wheelchair.  Well, he claims that he still gets erections, so.  We just want to know if she, like, mounts his lifeless body.  I'm sure she does.  I mean, the Viagra would work, wouldn't it?  I don't know if you're...  Well, I guess it would, maybe.  If there's no nerve, like, the whole nerve thing to stimulate down there, if you just  increase the blood flow to the area, it's going to get... he's going to get an erection, 
[00:04:00]  I guess.  That's right.  But he's not going to feel anything.  Yeah.  Now, Julia, she unhooks all his equipment, you know, so she could have sex, and obviously  it's looking like so she could have oral sex.  That would be pretty vile.  Christopher Reeve giving her oral sex.  Yes.  And now he doesn't have any of his ventilators or anything hooked up.  Can you imagine, like, she's getting close to an orgasm.  And now she has to decide, you know, he's starting to turn blue.  Do I put him back on the machines or wait for my orgasm?  She's got to be careful she doesn't clog up the hole or anything. 
[00:04:30]  I'm serious, though, you know?  Oh, no.  Like, hey, Chris, you okay?  I'm almost there.  I'm almost there.  I'm almost there.  You think that goes through her head, like, oh, no, you know, she's thinking maybe he  could last another 45 seconds without air?  I don't know.  The whole thing is sick.  That whole thing's pretty gross.  Horrible visual, Ann.  Well, you know, life must go on for these people, Opie.  She has her needs, I guess, and he's there to satisfy them.  I believe we have some audio of them having sex, Ann. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, really?  Where did we get this?  Well, I don't want to, you know, tell the people our sources, but should we go to that  tape now?  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, sure.  This is the Reeves having sex, Ann?  I guess so.  Okay.  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Hotter.  Hotter.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, hotter.  Oh, yeah.  Give it to me.  Higher.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  That was just wrong.  Well, uh, hope they're having fun together.  Uh, Joe?  The whole thing about, you played the audio and everything. 
[00:06:00]  Of him having sex?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's mean.  You guys, you should be grateful that you can do that without having to be hooked up to  anything.  Yeah.  Well, we're very grateful.  Totally.  But don't you wonder when you read something like that in the post, what's going on in  the bedroom?  Yeah, of course you wonder, but do I have to play that audio?  How about if he's listening?  I don't think so.  Well, he can't beat us up or anything.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, look.  You laughed a little.  I love the Opie and Anthony show.  It's one of the best shows on the radio. 
[00:06:30]  Poor guy.  That's mean.  Well, obviously it's a tragedy.  We all understand that.  But, I mean, I want to understand, you know, what kind of, if she's going to announce to  the post that she's having sex with her husband, she should give more details, right?  I've been listening for a year.  I love Whipin' Out Wednesday on the Tuesday homework.  Who is that?  That's Christopher Reeve, I believe.  Oh, is it?  He got an ISD in line to his home up there in Westchester.  Is that where he's living at? 
[00:07:00]  Have you guys ever been injured or anything where you can't have sex?  Very injured.  No, thank God.  No?  Have you?  Yeah.  Where you couldn't have sex?  Well, when we have our period, we don't want to have sex and it hurts you.  That's not injured.  That's not injured.  Can't put you on the DL for that.  Sometimes it looks like an injury, but you want to...  Sometimes it looks like an axe wound.  We understand that, but you want to see a real injury.  You try doing some, you know, high-speed California long stroke and have it bend. 
[00:07:30]  That's an injury.  You can't even watch that happen in a porno movie without every guy sitting around the  TV going, oh, Jesus Christ!  Oh, man, that hurts.  We still can't get over the kink in the hose move, you know?  It's like all of a sudden, do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, Jesus!  Oh, my God.  That'll leave a bruise.  All right, well, we're sorry we made fun of Christopher Reeve.  No, I'm just saying put yourselves in his position.  Well, I never would want to.  I am right now.  I'm sitting.  I guess it's better than somebody...  Okay, all right.  I guess it's better than somebody not getting it at all.  At least he's paralyzed and he can get it.  Yeah, see?  The visual is just very disturbing because she unhooks all his equipment and either mounts  him or puts her patch right in front of him. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, geez.  Or she just tilts the wheelchair and has him fall on her.  Something is going on that is quite disturbing.  You know what's terrible, too?  You ever hear him talk now?  He talks with the respirator, so the last part of his sentence is completely obliterated  because he doesn't have breath.  Well, he sentences a breath.  Yeah, but he runs out of breath.  So what, like talking dirty?  Oh, baby, you want my nice heart?  Oh, my God, Hank!  What the hell is wrong with you?  Come stand in front of me. 
[00:09:00]  I want to lick you.  Yeah, I'm going to give it to you hard right inside your heart.  You want it, don't you?  You want me to stick my heart right into my...  Pluck me back in!  Pluck me back in!  Pluck me back in!  That's right.  I could pound you all night with my nice heart.  Come on, Hank. 
[00:09:30]  Give me the bell.  Thank you.  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony show for today.  What's up, Anthony?  How you doing?  A little Christopher Reeve having sex to start off the show today.  Yes.  Denise wants in really fast, even though that was an older bit.  Let's go to Denise.  Ah, did I lose her?  No, she's on one.  Oh, there we go.  Denise, what's going on?  Nothing.  I had read an interview with her a while back, and apparently he gets erect involuntarily. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, it just comes out of nowhere.  Yeah, he can't steal it, and I guess when it arises, she just jumps on.  Hey, why not?  And that's the extent of their sex.  That can be kind of embarrassing.  You're sitting there, and you get them involuntary, and you can't hide them.  Shift it.  You know, sometimes you're sitting down, you get the pup tent going, and you've got to  do a little pocket thing.  Maybe you're just sitting at a dinner or something, or you're giving one of those speeches up on  stage at a high school, and oh, no, here it is. 
[00:10:30]  You can't, you know, sit on it.  No, you can't, like, fold your leg over a little or do a little pocket pull to get it  in position.  No, all you do is take your left leg and sit on it.  Give that little, yeah, yeah, you can give that little, yeah, that would suck.  Thank you, Denise.  You're welcome.  All right, bye.  Tad has a problem right off the bat here.  Tad, what's going on?  Hey, Tad.  Hey, yeah, there's a huge billboard in Times Square, O&A, wow, it's about five stories  tall. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  Very cool.  Yeah, that's the company kissing our asses, because, I mean, it's quite flattering to have  an Opie and Anthony billboard in the middle of Times Square in New York City.  Paid advertising.  It's what?  And saw it today, too.  It's about five stories high?  Five stories.  It's right over the ABC studio.  You can see it from the MTV studios as well.  Dude, get this.  When you are standing in the middle of Times Square, it is huge, and it just stands out.  It's right over the ABC, I think. 
[00:11:30]  And, yeah, it's giant.  It's huge.  I passed by it today on Broadway.  I'm like, oh, my God, that's huge.  A little message to the company that, you know, we've worked for.  You don't have to kiss our asses anymore.  We signed the contracts.  Yeah.  Stop.  We get it.  You care about us, finally.  Thank you.  Thank God so many people that live in New York City are in Times Square.  Yeah, we've explained this before.  That's why we're kind of embarrassed to see it.  Having a billboard in Times Square for a New York radio station is a complete waste of time.  Yeah.  Because no locals go to Times Square, really. 
[00:12:00]  Right.  You go if you have to, but, you know, you get out of that area as soon as you can.  You want to put them on, like, the Gowanus.  I don't know, the BQE somewhere.  That's fine.  Yeah, you want to help us out with billboards, you send them into the suburbs or downtown where all the locals are.  Right by the Midtown Tunnel.  A lot of commuters pass that every day.  Right.  Coming into Manhattan.  But the only people getting to check out that billboard are people from, like, the Midwest and down south. 
[00:12:30]  Take a picture of me with the wow in the background so I can say, wow, I was in New York City.  That must be what that's up there, forward.  All right.  Thanks, Tad.  Okay.  This guy can see it outside his window.  Matt, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  I'm staring at your son right now and at work.  Oh, okay.  Well, somebody at work will see it.  Well, it's just like you guys say, because I'm standing here, you know, waiting for some wow on Wednesday or something,  and then it's all these two things, it's six going, wow, oh, my God, what's going on with that?  Wow, it's New York.  Wow.  That must be what that means, wow. 
[00:13:00]  God damn.  How big is it there, Matt?  It's about, well, it's on top, it's about three stories up, and it's about, I would say, a good three stories high.  Yeah, that thing's giant.  It's tremendous.  And you can see it.  I mean, it's right next to where the ball drops.  Where I look, it's right across some big giant windows where everybody's sitting to the bar.  You can see it.  It's huge.  It is cool to see.  Like, as I was driving past it today, I'm like, God damn, that's pretty impressive.  I'm psyched it's there.  Your brother must be psyched as hell, okay?  That's his design. 
[00:13:30]  That's my brother's design right in the middle of Times Square.  I mean, we're really psyched, but as far as being effective for a radio show, it's not going to get us new listeners.  Maybe in syndication.  Maybe.  Maybe for one day.  Maybe the people, like, from, I don't know, some of these other cities we're going to be on, and soon they'll see the billboard in Times Square and remember us.  I just hope that they do some movie filming, Opie.  You know how they always have Times Square in a lot of movies, and it ends up immortalized in a movie.  That would be great.  That could be really cool.  Ralph, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:14:00]  Hey, guys, I've got a simple question.  I was at Times Square this weekend, just from Jersey, just looking at the crazy crowds.  What is on the corner?  There's, like, a group of almost, I wouldn't call them militant blacks with megaphones screaming.  Oh, those guys, yeah.  Oh, those guys scare the hell out of the tourists.  They say they're like the original Jewish people.  Well, I'm scared, too.  I'm not a tourist.  I was riding a bike, and it's just annoying.  They pull these white rubes out of the crowd that are walking down the sidewalk and get into these shouting matches with them, and it's a no-win scenario. 
[00:14:30]  Like, the white guy, they'll call Whitey the devil right there in front of them.  And then you go, well, why is white people the devil?  And then they just, like, have 20,000 things they've said for years rehearsed, and they just blast you with it.  Yeah.  You just walk past them.  It's a scary scene.  I just don't understand.  If that's free speech, it scares me a little.  I'm surprised the car never accidentally ran off the road right into them.  That's fine.  Ralph, you've got to have the free speech, my friend.  Right.  Yeah, well.  It doesn't work to your advantage all the time, but you've got to have the free speech. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, put racist Vinny out there on a podium.  See how quick they'd yank him.  Yeah, right next to him.  That's true.  Hey, let's see how brave Vinny is.  We should send racist Vinny there with a mic.  Thank you.  You just came up with a bit, Ralph.  Let's see how brave Vinny the racist is.  We'll get him over there.  These guys are hardcore militant blacks that think they're the original Jews.  Yeah.  And they're out there just scaring tourists all day long.  That's all they do every day.  Yeah.  So we'll get Vinny the racist there.  We'll mic him up and send him down there to maybe confront him. 
[00:15:30]  Let's see if Vinny calls in now.  He's always looking for a little piece of the radio show.  You know what I'm talking about.  Sean, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on?  I was just calling about the webcam for Times Square.  Yeah.  You can see the wow right there.  It's the whole screen.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I guess it's Times Square live cams.  Yeah, something like that.  My wife was on last night.  She's like, come here.  Look at this.  Times Square.  I go over there and all I see is wow right on the whole pure screen.  Yeah.  It's three stories high we're here.  I haven't seen it yet. 
[00:16:00]  Anthony checked it out.  But what's the website?  Honestly, I don't know.  She did some kind of search on one of those search engines for webcams.  Yeah, you just got to pop in on, you go to Yahoo and then pop in Times Square live cam and it'll pop up.  All right, cool.  All right, guys.  Thank you, Sean.  Scott's saying the billboard is genius.  Oh, really?  Scott.  It's a marketing genius.  Yeah.  You got to thank these guys.  By having the wow on the billboard in Times Square, when you're going into all these other markets, 
[00:16:30]  now you're going to have them where they're going to see this wow,  they're going to go back to their little Hickville or wherever they're from,  and they're going to say, oh, I've seen that in New York.  What is that?  And then they're going to tune into the local station.  And wow, posted a 22 million places across the country.  You want to have a recognition where there's people saying, what is that?  What is that?  Well, Scott, I got to say it again, though.  I mean, the only reason that billboard is in Times Square is because the company is trying to make an impression on Ant and I finally.  Yeah.  Because they didn't do nothing for us for three years. 
[00:17:00]  We worked all that out.  Oh, yeah.  It took a while.  We worked it all out.  We signed the contract.  We're happy, but they're still kissing our ass and, you know, blowing smoke up our ba-ba-ba.  Let them spend all the money they got.  All right, Scott.  Thank you.  I just got you guys on my license plate.  I'm in Connecticut.  Wow.  O-N-A.  Wow.  Hopefully I'll meet you guys down when you do the car wash.  And so I'm going to get you some digital pictures in the next few days.  Cool.  Yeah.  We're still looking for a place to do the teen car wash, so. 
[00:17:30]  Excellent.  Stay tuned.  Nice talking.  Take care.  Thank you.  You just saw it, Ben?  Ben's on the Times Square webcams.  Steve, what's going on?  What's going on?  Hey.  I don't know if you guys saw today's news day.  There was a thing about one of your products, Planet Java or something like that.  And there's this dude with blonde hair sitting there with a WOW t-shirt, 1027, right in  the middle of, you know, two big color pictures in the middle of New York News Day.  And it's got your, he's wearing your shirt.  You know, we saw that. 
[00:18:00]  And the funny part about it is, you know how Ant bitched last week because he got used  pretty bad in Time, Time Magazine?  Yeah.  See, it works both ways.  Because if you look at that picture, it says, 1027 WAW, WOW, Anthony.  Yeah, yeah.  I kind of missed the Opie part.  I noticed that.  It's funny.  In the lower right corner.  It's very funny, of course.  Because we keep track of that stuff just as a goof.  It's fun.  Talk one, talk one on your side then.  Yeah, Planet Java.  I think it's part three of News Day today.  Activity's vote.  All right, bro.  Thank you.  That camera thing is earthcam.com. 
[00:18:30]  Earthcam.com.  Then what?  Go to the Times Square?  Yeah, you can find it from there.  All right.  John, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Good.  The black people out there on the corner, it's a 5% of religion where they believe the  white man is the devil and that they're the original people and that they're a god or whatever.  There you go.  Perfect situation for Vinny.  I wonder if he's going to call up and have the balls to go down there today.  I'll go down there with Vinny.  All right.  Cool.  Thanks, John. 
[00:19:00]  Take my information.  I'll go down there with him.  I'm all fair.  No, trust me.  The bid is Vinny going down there because he's really brave on the phone.  And we finally found something there.  He's perfect for, and we'll see if he goes for it.  Okay.  Enjoy yourself, guys.  Thank you, John.  This guy, Karaoke Russ, he's got a good point.  He says, the wow will never be on TV or a movie.  Anyone shooting video or film digitally removes the ads.  But I've seen plenty that have it.  But they say CBS This Morning digitally puts ads up over the real ads. 
[00:19:30]  They kind of digitally pop the pictures of paying advertisers.  No kidding.  So when they show Times Square, they clip out anyone that doesn't pay for advertising and  then digitally pop in on a billboard somebody that advertises on their show.  I don't know how they do that, especially like with the sporting events.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Where, you know, you have a moving picture and then they're now showing you where the  first yard marker is.  Or now what they're doing in baseball games, they have advertisements behind home plate. 
[00:20:00]  That's not there.  I know.  It's just for TV.  How the F do they do that?  It's amazing.  Science.  Because you can't really tell.  Tommy's saying this is all going to our head.  Yeah.  Oh, hey.  What's up?  Hey, Tommy.  Hey, listen, guys.  Could you even imagine 15, 20 years ago that you'd be walking through Times Square and  see your names up on a building?  No.  It's got to be going to your head, no?  All this fame.  Yeah.  What do you think?  It's going to my head.  Come on.  I'm just happy.  You're acting so calm and cool, Hope. 
[00:20:30]  You know that this has got to be going to your head.  No, I said it.  I think it's really, really cool.  That is pretty cool.  Don't get me wrong, but it's not going to help the radio show.  It's just cool to see, though.  Well, like you said, I agree.  It should be on the LIE, so that way all the drivers will see it and they've got the  number.  They can tune in.  Right.  All right, Tommy.  Thank you.  Take it easy, guys.  All right.  I think it's cool.  It'd be good, you know.  That'd be great if we didn't have girls.  That's a great chick magnet.  You're going to Times Square.  You point up at your name and go, see that?  That's me.  Well, you know what?  We're going to have to have a special Whip-Em-Out Wednesday in Times Square. 
[00:21:00]  This Wednesday.  A mass wowing to the big wow billboard, maybe.  We're going to have to.  We're going to have to bow to the wow billboard.  Whip, woo.  Whip, woo.  There'll be some weird Planet of the Apes thing.  We'll worship the wow billboard.  Worship the billboard.  Mass wowing in Times Square.  That'd be cool.  Hey, what the hell?  We'll get some ringers and we'll go to Times Square.  Want to do that?  Hell yeah.  Let's do it.  We'll do it Wednesday.  Dan-O.  Hall.  Oh, hey.  How's it hanging?  Hey.  What's going on, guys?  I got one of those signs off the buses this weekend. 
[00:21:30]  I own a van in the city.  I own a florist in the city.  I put it on the back of my van.  All right.  Let me tell you something.  They've been doing it.  Now, those bumper stickers are the bumper cards on the back of the buses?  Yeah.  We need those.  Those are effective.  Yeah.  They're all over the place.  And they're driving.  And people are being turned on in the show by seeing that.  Like we said, the Times Square wow thing, very cool.  Not going to help the show.  But the ones on the back of the buses, that helps the show.  Stop stealing them.  No, no.  I got a florist in the city. 
[00:22:00]  My van's in the city all day long.  I saw a couple of buses in the last few days where it was obvious that we had, you know,  the wow bumper sticker or whatever, you know, the huge ones on the back of the buses, where  it was supposed to be nothing.  You could just tell they were stolen.  Because you could see some remnants of it around the edges.  You see the colors.  It's like, oh, there was a wow on the back of that bus.  Oh, that was a huge wow.  People are heisting them.  Dano, thank you.  You guys, take it easy.  Okay.  Jimmy is going to go further with this removing of ad thing.  Jimmy.  Mean and friendly. 
[00:22:30]  How are you today?  Hey, all right.  Yeah.  You guys talked about digitally removing the ad.  Well, when Fox got NASCAR that first week, anybody that didn't pay him, they were digitally  removing the ads off the car.  Now, how the hell did they do that?  The cars are moving.  How are they doing this?  That's what I'm saying.  I can understand if it's just a shot and it's not going to move.  Well, they came in trouble because, you know, they're saying all these people paid their  money to get on the car.  Hell, yeah.  If Fox had taken them off, then how is anybody going to see them?  Are you positive they're taking the ads off the NASCAR car?  I wouldn't doubt it. 
[00:23:00]  It was the first week.  It was the first week.  They weren't allowed to do it after that.  Hold on.  Stinky has some insight here.  Comment?  They take a picture of the actual ad on the car, and then when the camera picks up  that picture from any angle, it just blocks it out.  Whoa.  So it's like mapped.  They mapped the picture.  Guys, have a good one.  Guys, Jimmy.  I mean, it knows when it sees it again to cancel it out.  Holy brilliant.  Wow.  You know, I don't want this to be like a racist thing.  We got a black guy on the line. 
[00:23:30]  Uh-huh.  Those militant black guys in Times Square yell at the black guys as well.  Yeah.  Shahid.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, bud.  Yeah, just a quick point, man.  The guys on the corner, their religion is called, they call themselves the black Hebrew  Israelites.  Right.  That's what they call themselves.  It's not a 5% of religion, whatever that means.  And I almost had to fight those guys on a couple of occasions, man.  Why is that?  Because, like you just said, these guys are equal opportunity haters, man.  They hate anybody that doesn't conform to their ideology. 
[00:24:00]  You know what I'm saying?  So I just want to put that out there.  They just don't yell at white people.  Oh, really?  They don't yell at blacks, Hispanics, whatever.  They don't care, man.  They don't care.  Do they yell at the chinks, too?  They yell at, man, you know what?  I've got to send you guys a couple of videotapes.  And you'll see the way they, because what they do in the street is one thing, but they  have a public access celebration show up here.  I've seen that on the Brooklyn Cable Access.  I've seen it.  Oh, those guys go to Florida.  You've got these white, retired grandmothers standing on the corner trying to argue with 
[00:24:30]  them.  It's good stuff.  It's good stuff.  Notice how Vinny hasn't called in yet.  I know.  All right, Shahid.  Thank you.  All right, man.  Later.  Bye.  This guy wants to give a serious insight into those guys, the black guys.  All right.  Nicky.  All right.  How you doing, guys?  Great show.  Okay.  Let me know if this is getting a little boring.  I'll try to keep it as brief as possible.  All right.  Okay.  The religion, which is known as Judaism today, is originally called Talmudism.  And way back when...  Boring. 
[00:25:00]  Eh.  Boy, that didn't take long.  We're a fast-paced show here.  Caroline.  Hey, how are you?  Is it Carolyn or Caroline?  Caroline, Brian.  I love that old gag.  It works every time.  Funny because it's true.  Cool.  What's up?  I wanted to say on ESPN Classic, they show the old baseball games.  They've digitally put in new ads behind home plate.  So you can watch, like, you know, Hank Aaron get the home run record.  And then behind it, there's, you know, some ad for a new company that wasn't around back 
[00:25:30]  then.  Like Planet Java or something.  Exactly.  Can't they digitally cut Oscar Gamble's hair sticking out of his baseball cap?  That's part of the fun of watching the old games.  Can't they digitally remove those two losers that had to follow Hank Aaron around the base  path so it would look so much cooler to the baseball purists?  The old classic.  They could put some ads on their t-shirts.  Yeah, put some ads on their t-shirts.  There you go.  That's somebody I would love to interview someday.  The two clowns that had to follow Hank Aaron around it. 
[00:26:00]  How drunk were they?  And how did they get almost around all the bases with Hank?  Oh, these days?  The highlight of their lives.  That would not happen.  Not at all.  Highlight of their lives.  All right.  Thanks, Caroline.  Bye.  It's Caroline Brian.  We should take our first break.  We're just warming up.  Oh, wait.  This guy's been waiting for a while.  Jose.  Jose.  Yeah.  You're on the radio.  Let's go.  Como esta?  I'm doing okay.  Didn't you know this on McMahon that she had an implant? 
[00:26:30]  Stephanie McMahon had implants?  Yeah.  I thought Vince did.  When?  I believe it was on Thursday.  Because if you see Monday's show, she got it like very small.  And then on Thursday, you see with the white shirt that she got it like big.  They look like 36C.  Hey, can we call our fine friends at WWF?  They'll tell us.  Stephanie McMahon, we asked her about that.  She said she would never get breast implants.  Yeah.  And she admitted on our show that they hang a little low.  Well, right now it's going to do the tape and I'm just going to bring it to you guys. 
[00:27:00]  All right, Jose.  We'll call WWF.  They'll tell us.  Okay.  All right.  Bye.  She's on her period and they got a little.  Thanks, Rick.  Dan.  How you doing, guys?  I want to ask about the man boob contest.  Ah.  Man boob contest is on this week, right?  Okay.  How do I go about entering?  It's very easy.  It's like any other contest that we do.  You just come on down between 3 and 7 any day this week and get pictures done. 
[00:27:30]  Okay.  No problem.  With this one, because it's quite an embarrassing thing.  If you don't want your head on the internet, that is fine.  No, we just will put the man boob pictures up.  That's it.  But if you're brave enough to have your face on, you want a little exposure, we can do that, too.  Sure.  But just show up if you think you have a man boob problem and we'll take your pictures and then, you know, our fine listeners will vote for the guy that really needs help and we're going to give him a free procedure.  Okay.  Thanks a lot, guys.  All right.  All righty then.  Okay.  Bye.  Anthony, for fuller hair, a thinner body, and a fresher look, see Dr. Gregory Pistone, www.doctor or drpistone.com. 
[00:28:00]  All right.  The correct pronunciation is Dr. Pistone.  Thank you for writing that.  Also sponsoring this is goldenpalace.com.  When you vote on the man boobs, you'll have a chance to enter for a trip to hedonism, too.  All righty.  That sounds great.  Dr. Pistone is in Philadelphia and he gets rid of man boobs all the time.  So if you've got the man boobs, come on down.  We might be able to help you out.  Hey, quick break, and I want to tell you about my little weekend. 
[00:28:30]  I heard it was a little harrowing.  Just happy to be alive today.  No exaggeration.  Just happy to be alive today.  Could I wait until I at least get one paycheck from the new contract before you kill yourself?  Please?  Hopefully we'll have pictures soon if you're not going to believe the story I'm about to tell.  Huge car accident Friday, right about the time we're supposed to be on the air. 
[00:29:00]  I mean, we took Friday off.  I don't want to, like, tell people that's the reason we weren't here.  No.  But I was in Rochester and, uh, we'll give the details next.  All right.  Give a little story.  Don't go to, uh, CNN for dick jokes.  Don't come here for the news.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I like it when this show's dirty.  Anthony, what am I drinking right now?  O2 Go.  There you go.  You're drinking it.  Why not?  Oxygenated water.  That's right.  No minerals or tap water.  Once you taste O2 Go, all other water tastes like crap. 
[00:29:30]  It's oxygenated for your health.  It's got a light and crisp taste.  No aftertaste.  O2 Go, the original oxygenated distilled drinking water, has the unsurpassed purity of distilled water along with light, crisp taste.  You know, I didn't know this.  When they distill water, it tastes like garbage.  You ever drink distilled water?  That we heard from the guys from O2 Go.  So, uh, they've, uh, oxygenated it.  And it gives it a clean, crisp taste.  You learned all that during that meeting?  I was snoozing.  I saw that.  I was listening.  It incorporates and stabilizes the oxygen that's in the water itself without the use of, uh, chemicals or additives. 
[00:30:00]  It boosts the energy and, uh, increases your stamina.  Helps keep you focused and alert.  Everyone loves oxygen, right?  Don't you love it?  What?  I would die without oxygen.  Huh?  Up to eight times more oxygen than other bottled water.  It's O2 Go.  Get it now.  O2 Go.  O.P. and Anthony.  Wow!  1027 WNEW.  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[00:30:30]  If you're not listening to us in New York City or Connecticut or Jersey or parts of Pennsylvania,  we've got a few phone lines open at 866-277-4WOW.  Tony, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, boy.  Yes.  Props to Cleveland, man.  You guys watched the pay-per-view last night?  Uh, I was traveling still, no.  All right, dude.  Watch the, if you watch, catch the replay.  There's a dude in the front row, red sign, I heart the Olsen twins. 
[00:31:00]  I love the Olsen twins, sir.  Yeah, dude, it was funny as hell.  We turned it into a drinking game.  They must have showed it about 25 times during the pay-per-view.  Nice.  I would love to talk to that guy today.  Yeah, put it out to Cleveland, man.  It was funny as hell.  Look at Cleveland helping us out.  You can see the wrestlers, some of them looking up, you know, and they walk past the crowd.  One guy, a few of the wrestlers looked up and they started chuckling.  One more quick question.  Yeah.  Did Ken Stevens' Big Pen have any body glitter on it?  No. 
[00:31:30]  Guys are kicking ass.  Keep it up, baby.  Thank you, Tony.  Later, fellas.  Bye.  There he goes.  Tony.  Stacey wants to say something about Columbus.  Stacey.  Hey, how you guys doing?  Pretty good.  That's good.  I was in Columbus this weekend and saw Regan.  Hold on, you're the girl that got her foot cut off by the lawnmower.  Yeah.  I remember you.  How you guys been?  Her heel got cut off, right?  Her heel, that's right.  And they rebuilt it and it looks kind of funky, but it's a foot still.  We got, like, naked pictures of you somewhere.  Yeah, it was on the whipped cream bikini contest. 
[00:32:00]  Now, Stacey's not to be confused with the girl that had the fake foot that came off when she was having sex.  That wasn't me.  No, of course not.  Thanks.  Yeah, I was pretty depressed.  I didn't even get to be one of the finalists.  That's all right.  That's all right.  There's only one real winner.  You're still hot.  So, what's up?  Not much.  I got to tell you guys, my mom freaked out when she found out I did that.  Oh, really?  Oh, my God.  She called here hysterical at, like, midnight.  For some reason, moms and dads, they don't appreciate that stuff.  Oh, I don't know why.  I don't either.  I thought it was hysterical. 
[00:32:30]  Buddy-duddies.  So, what do you got about Columbus?  I just saw Regan on a Saturday at a place called The Funny Bone and it was hysterical.  In Columbus?  Yeah.  Hmm.  Ohio?  What the hell were you doing there?  Visiting family.  Oh, you got family there.  Yeah.  And we were stalking Regan.  Regan rocks.  That's when you stalk him.  You should have walked up there and said, Opie sent me.  We waited after the show to see if we could run into him, but only the opener came out  Jim Short.  Oh, he's good, too.  Yeah, he was pretty funny.  All right, Stacey. 
[00:33:00]  Thank you.  No problem.  It was good talking to you guys again.  Definitely.  We'll see you soon, okay?  Sounds good.  All right.  Bye.  I've got to tell my story, but Darren's behind two girls making out.  I don't know if this is it.  Really?  Darren.  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  I'm on Route 80 going east.  I'm in like West Patterson now.  There's two girls in a black Honda making out and the one keeps leaning over.  The other one's left.  No way.  Where to God?  That's a hard move to do.  You know.  Leaning over towards the middle of the car.  Both of them like sucking pace for a little while and then she's picking her head back up.  What, is traffic moving slow? 
[00:33:30]  It's actually, I'm doing 70.  Wow, and they're pulling that move going 70?  All the way from, I picked them up in like Parsippany.  They were actually behind me.  Yeah.  And there she goes again, leaning over.  Right.  You know, for the girl to give a guy a whatcha-do there while he's driving, that's one thing.  For a girl to give another girl, like the head down by the seat area there, call it the whatcha-do.  I like that.  The whatcha-do.  I like the whatcha-do.  You know, you give it a little whatcha-do while you're driving.  And that's kind of a hard move. 
[00:34:00]  It is.  You know, you can't really get to a good vital area there with the seat right there.  So, I don't know.  That's a talent those girls have, I guess.  It's hard enough sometimes in a wide open bed to get the right angle.  Without having to put on a neck brace the next morning.  Why does it hurt to swallow today?  My neck hurts.  Right.  And my ears are plugging up.  Hey, Rich, what's going on? 
[00:34:30]  Rich.  Yeah.  Come on, let's go.  We got a good pace going today.  How you doing, man?  Yes.  Rich, I think it was Friday or Saturday.  Oh, we'll get into the whole Asbury Park thing.  Yes.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah, we're well aware of it and rumors are that it's going to try to arrest Aunt Nye and  they're pissed at the club.  And, yeah, we'll get into a whole discussion on that.  The place we had our last road show, they're up in arms over our appearance at the Stone  Pony.  Rich, we'll do that in a few minutes, okay?  Sounds good. 
[00:35:00]  All right.  Yeah, we got press clippings and everything.  Very interesting.  Yeah, they did a couple of days on this story.  And we need some answers, I think.  Yeah.  There's some things that were said by certain people that I don't know if they're accurate  or not.  It's quite the melee, though.  All right.  Anthony, I almost died Friday.  Yeah.  I know.  You almost died.  Happy to be alive.  That's great.  You know how they talk about, well, I should explain, we took Friday off, we need a little 
[00:35:30]  breather, and I flew into Rochester, New York.  Did a lot of time up there between school and radio and girlfriends and all sorts of  crap.  Nice flight.  No problems with the flight.  Piece of cake.  See?  Got to thank the fine folks at JetBlue.  Great airline.  You get to watch TV the whole time for free.  Great.  So I'm checking out, you know, ESPN, a little British Open.  It was nice.  Yeah.  And I landed in Rochester.  Too bad you couldn't drive around in the plane the whole time, right? 
[00:36:00]  And you know how they talk about flying?  They say, you know, you have a better chance dying, driving to the airport or driving away  from the airport than actually flying.  I think we've all heard that by now.  Yeah.  Holy S.  That was almost a statistic.  Oh, man.  Don't you go dying yet?  So I landed in Rochester and I was hanging with Brother Weez, one of my old friends there.  He does Saturday nights here on WNEW. 
[00:36:30]  And he's got the morning show.  Got the morning show and we're going to be on at WCMF in Rochester in the very near future.  Very exciting.  Doing a little reconnaissance, Opie?  A little softening of the beaches up there?  No, they're beyond sight.  Seriously.  No, it was just like a boat trip.  We went across Lake Ontario to Canada and hung out, jet skied all weekend.  It was great.  But getting there almost didn't happen.  So they pick us up from the airport and we stop at Wegmans, the big supermarket chain up there. 
[00:37:00]  Got some food for the trip.  And literally, no joke, less than 40 minutes from touching down, we're in a nasty car accident.  Oh.  Oh, all right.  No!  You don't like that skid sound.  Was there a skid?  I don't know.  And I'll tell you.  Oh, really?  That just, look at my arm.  You're not done conscious?  No, nothing.  Nothing like that. 
[00:37:30]  So the truck is loaded with groceries and stuff.  It was one of those sport track.  It's like an SUV with a bed.  Have you seen the sport track?  Yeah.  You know, I don't even know if they advertise on the show, but hey, man, you got a good vehicle there.  They got a nice side collision rating with Opie.  Saved my life.  Thank you.  Nice fat doors.  Nice car.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I'm getting the picture sent of me soon, though.  I want to see these pictures.  So we have groceries in the car and now I'm going, look, man, I'm hungry. 
[00:38:00]  And they're like, hey, nice restaurant right up the road.  Less than 40 minutes from touching down.  So the cops said later on when we were thinking again that it was called a courtesy accident.  Courtesy accident.  And I think this happens all the time.  And I'm sure we could take phone calls for the next two hours that this has happened to other people.  We're trying to make a left into a restaurant.  All right.  Help me out, because you know the story.  So if I'm not like describing this well, help me out.  So we're making a left into the restaurant to eat. 
[00:38:30]  There are two lanes of traffic that I got to get over.  You've got to cut through.  Cut through.  There's a light behind us about at least 100 yards, maybe more.  I think a lot of people have been in this situation.  So the cars are all backed up all the way to the light.  But you've got to make a left through the line of cars that are stopped at the light.  Correct.  Two lanes.  And usually people don't leave the opening and you're sitting there with your blinker on.  And they're not going anywhere because the light's red.  Right.  And you can't get through them.  Two lanes.  So we're able to get a space where the two cars move up.  Then you've got the two cars, you know, they stay where they are. 
[00:39:00]  Now you've got a space.  Now it's car, restaurant.  We want to go there.  Let's take the left.  So Brother Weez takes the left, right?  Dude, next thing I know, all hell breaks loose.  Oops.  Not two lanes.  There are three.  There was a third lane.  There was a turning lane.  And there was a guy going at least 50 miles an hour.  And if you think I'm exaggerating, if there's someone that, you know, does the investigations of accidents, help me out with this one, okay? 
[00:39:30]  So he goes through the two lanes.  Now we're in the third lane.  Car hits us going 50 miles an hour.  No one saw it, which is the scariest feeling ever.  When you know you're going to be in an accident, you can kind of get ready for it real fast.  They say that's bad, though.  Dude.  They say it's better to just be relaxed and you don't know about it.  And that's why a lot of drunks, they don't get injured when they get hit.  When you tense up and go to prepare for an accident because you see it coming, that's when you really get hurt.  That's what I hear.  I got to go to Brian right away.  Brian, what's up?  Yeah, Opie, do you have an eye patch on?  You sound like that intern. 
[00:40:00]  I knew you guys were going to do this.  Where's your eye patch, Opie?  Look at my nose.  All right.  I'll be in a flash report.  All right.  Thank you.  I had a Marsha Brady nose all weekend.  You did?  Oh, yeah.  I can see it's definitely bruised right at the bridge here.  It's bruised.  It used to be it was swollen a lot more.  Yeah.  So anyway, so the guy, you know, hits us going 50 right where I'm sitting in the passenger seat.  I'm saying 50 miles an hour.  Drags the car sideways at least 20 feet.  That's where I need help.  20 feet. 
[00:40:30]  That's where I need help with an investigator.  It was definitely 20 feet because we paced it off like, holy ass, look how far he pushed this whole thing.  Both tires completely blown out.  Now, flat on the road from where he hit, okay, airbags go off like crazy.  When the car hit, I didn't know if it was a tractor trailer.  That's where it was scary.  I didn't know what kind of car hit us.  I don't know if it was.  I didn't know how big the car was.  It was, you know, normal size.  It was like a Pontiac or something, okay?  Yeah.  Hits us.  I go flying sideways, take out the rear view mirror with my nose, hence the bruised, pretty bruised nose. 
[00:41:00]  Now, you must not have been wearing your seatbelt.  I think I was.  I think, how do you hit the rear view mirror if you're wearing your goddamn seatbelt?  Went sideways.  So?  And forward.  You can't go forward with your seatbelt on.  I don't know.  Maybe I didn't have the seatbelt.  I really don't know.  I really don't know.  If you didn't have the seatbelt on, you're a nut.  I really don't know.  I thought I did.  Went sideways, took out the whole rear view mirror.  Now, I'm thinking I just went through the windshield. 
[00:41:30]  Because I'm like, holy ass, what the F just happened?  Because it was just so freaking violent.  Thought I broke my neck.  Which is the worst feeling.  Oh, then you'd be like Christopher Reeve.  That's why the whole Christopher Reeve thing to start the show today wasn't too funny.  Oh, that would have been awful.  Someone around here has a sick sense of humor.  Someone push the button for Opie.  Right.  I still want to work the board.  I still want to twiddle my own knobs.  He'll be working at Light FM. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, yeah.  Well, you don't have to do anything.  Oh, my nose!  Is that you right after the crash, Opie?  Oh, my nose!  Oh, my nose!  Audio from inside the truck.  Excuse me, is that your nose or did a bus park on your face?  If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and crawl under your bed.  Oh, Eric's got a great one right here. 
[00:42:30]  Eric, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  If you would have listened to Aunt's mother-in-law and not made the left, it would have been all right.  See?  Maybe she's on to something.  I don't make left-hand turns because I don't like them.  They're scary and very dangerous.  So, I do, I make three rights because that's a left.  Three rights make a left.  Where's my box of wine?  Got your nose.  That's right. 
[00:43:00]  Three rights do make a left.  And see?  That would have helped you out.  Three rights make a left.  Nice.  And back to haunt you, didn't it?  So, I go sideways, right into the rearview mirror.  Rest of my body.  Now, my head stopped pretty much because my nose stopped that part of it.  And the rest of my body keeps going, I swear to God, I thought I'd snap my neck.  I'm like, holy ass.  What a way to go out, man.  Yeah.  No!  Oh.  That had...  Oh.  So, I stagger out of the car. 
[00:43:30]  Immediately, the nose blows up.  Blows up.  Yeah.  Two crackheads come stumbling out of a hotel...  Motel.  The crackhead motel.  The crackhead motel.  Were you staying there the night over?  Oh, no, no, no, no.  The restaurant was right next door to the crackhead.  I thought maybe you kind of grew fond of the crack hotels.  No.  Oh, yeah.  From Wednesday, whatever?  Yeah.  Yeah, I forgot about that.  So, they come out with ice.  You got to do the voice of the crackhead for me.  You might need some ice. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  For you alone.  Yo, I got some other stuff you might want to park just.  All the airbags go off.  Well, that's cool, huh?  I've never experienced that before.  That scares the crap out of you right there.  That's more...  In some cases, more scary than the actual accident.  Like, where the hell did all this come from?  Yeah.  All of a sudden, there's just stuff hanging.  Holy mackerel.  And the powder on it.  Yeah.  What is that powder? 
[00:44:30]  Because it makes the car look like it's in flames and it's all smoke.  It's like coin starch stuff.  Right.  It's the bag from sticking.  So, Sandy's trapped in the back seat with Weez's wife.  Trapped?  Yeah.  They couldn't get the doors on.  Not the smoke.  Not the smoke.  I stagger out.  I have to check my ass to make sure I'm okay.  Look at all me.  I'm getting out.  What a hero.  Hero?  And chick's in the back seat.  She can't get out.  You're out of that vehicle, man.  You got it.  Dude, did you turn around and go, 
[00:45:00]  Sandy, are you okay?  She's right out there.  She can tell you.  What did you do?  You just left the vehicle?  And I went from,  holy ass,  I went through a freaking windshield.  Right.  To, holy ass,  I just snapped my neck.  To, oh my God,  I could still walk within seconds.  Sandy.  Hi.  How are you doing?  Is your mic on?  Go ahead.  Yeah.  Did he turn around at any point after the accident,  before he got out,  and say,  Sandy, are you okay?  No. 
[00:45:30]  Wait, wait, wait.  He fled the vehicle.  Wait.  He ran away.  Ah!  Oh my God, there's smoke!  Him,  him and Brother Weez  flew out of the car  and left us in the back.  Did you talk about Doreen  banging on the window?  Weez's wife is banging on the back seat window or whatever.  Because we couldn't get out.  Yeah, the back window.  Back window just like,  so you guys are out of the vehicle.  They're trapped in the back seat.  Smoke everywhere.  And there's the smoke.  And I thought the car was going to blow.  Yeah, it wasn't,  it was the stuff in the airbag,  but we didn't know at the time.  We're choking in the back seat. 
[00:46:00]  No joke.  I got to get out of here.  And I had to check my ass.  I didn't know what was wrong.  Of course you do.  You got to like,  take care of the numero uno.  I understand.  And then we had groceries,  potato chip bags,  open,  open in the street.  So were you and Weez  sitting on the curb eating chips going,  ooh, that was a tough one, huh?  Yeah.  Hey, where are the girls?  You know,  Weez's number's on my phone  if someone wants to get them online real fast.  You have to get them online. 
[00:46:30]  If you get the phone.  So,  I can't believe you didn't just turn around and go,  are you okay before anything?  No joke.  I was dazed and confused.  How hard did the car hit?  I need back up here.  It was horrific.  I don't doubt it.  I know people have been in worse accidents,  so I don't want to like,  you know,  make it bigger than it was,  but it was horrific.  I want to see the pictures.  I can't wait.  It was bad.  So I stagger out.  You know what the weirdest feeling is?  We went up to Rochester to have a good time. 
[00:47:00]  So we went from being very jovial,  like,  ooh, it's going to be a great weekend,  boat trip to Canada.  You know,  we got our groceries and our wine and laughing to,  oh my God,  I think I'm dead within two seconds.  It's the weirdest feeling in the world.  Yeah.  So then,  now I'm staggering around the parking lot of this restaurant,  the crack,  the crackhead hotel,  and the lady gives me the ice and stuff.  And Brother Weez looks at me and goes,  yo,  bro,  it doesn't look that bad.  You can't go to the hospital.  We still got to go on this boat trip.  That's all he can do. 
[00:47:30]  It's the last thing on my mind.  I'm thinking,  weekend done,  I'm going to be in a hospital for at least two or three days.  Right.  I'm still not,  you know,  not sure exactly what is wrong with me.  Oh, man.  It was effed up.  Yeah, it's just a bump.  As soon as we all got out and we looked at him,  he had this,  like,  bump that was just growing on the bridge of his nose.  The swelling is way down,  but I know,  I can do so.  I don't know if it's going to work,  though.  I can move the whole body.  Yeah,  watch this.  No,  don't,  don't do anything,  please.  It cracks.  Listen to this.  You might not be able to hear it on the radio.  I hope it works.  All right,  let's hear it.  Don't do that. 
[00:48:00]  Don't do that.  That's my nose,  and I don't know if it's broken,  cracked.  I don't know if the car,  it's not crooked,  but it's the whole bottom half just moves.  Dude,  if you sneeze wrong now,  the nose bone is going to go into your brain.  You better get to a hospital.  I'm waiting for those calls.  And then I had the,  yeah,  I had the Marsha Brady nose for most of the weekend.  Now it's just really dark bruise on the,  on the bridge.  Yeah,  I could,  I definitely see that.  The swelling's way down. 
[00:48:30]  Oh man.  The swelling's way down.  So it was unbelievable.  And next thing I know,  like within 10 minutes of being hit like this,  you know,  my friend,  Brother Weez is on a phone getting another car.  Cause this car is totally gone.  Get another one.  Get another car.  So,  so yeah,  so we could go to the boat.  Did you let him drive?  No joke.  Since then,  I've been in a few cabs and cars since.  I'm freaking.  Now you're freaking out.  Let me tell you something about the Curtis.  The Curtis accident that you were talking about. 
[00:49:00]  When you get these jackasses sometimes,  cause this happens all the time,  that wave you on.  They'll stop.  I've seen people stop and there's a line of cars behind them because this jackass is going  to be courteous and wave you through the left turn.  Don't wave me through.  Just go.  I'll find my spot.  Cause as they're waving,  I'm looking at the lane coming up and this car's speeding toward me.  Yeah.  I'm not going to go because someone's waving me on.  Cause most of these jackholes never realize that there's more cars on the road. 
[00:49:30]  They're coming my way.  Yeah.  I'm not going to take your word for it.  So why did,  why didn't we edge out a little?  Take the look.  I'll tell you why.  And this is the weirdest thing.  Cause I remember thinking to myself,  cause I I'm with you.  Cause I don't trust anyone that waves me on when you're left in front of cars.  Never.  I never saw that third lane,  how all the cars were backed up.  It just looked like there was kind of a wider median.  So there was a right turn lane that was wide open,  wide open.  This,  this car was barreling.  Like I'm going to someone help me out,  but I'm saying he was going 50 and I would love to know how, 
[00:50:00]  how hard you got to hit a car.  That's pretty much stationary to move it sideways 20 feet.  Oh no,  not another physics.  Cause I know,  I know,  I know,  I know,  but that's the public service today.  When,  when someone is doing that courtesy thing.  Yeah.  I,  I don't,  I don't pay attention.  To people waving me on.  Uh,  Opie,  you sound like George Costanza during the fire.  George ran out of the house.  Opie just had to get the hell out of here.  I had to check my ass. 
[00:50:30]  You got it.  You,  when you're in an accident,  you got to get out and check your ass.  Numero uno.  Opie did some quick triage.  I got to get out of here.  I got to make sure I got all my bones in the right place.  Then I could go in and help out.  All right.  This guy says he could help me with,  uh,  Bobby.  Yeah.  Hey.  How you doing?  What's up?  Uh,  you called me before.  You wanted to know about,  uh,  forensic,  I'm a forensic axontologist.  Axontologist.  And judging by your story,  there's two problems there.  All right.  First thing,  they should have lowered your shorts and checked the skid mark.  And the second thing is you always got to make three rights to make a left. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  Thanks.  Accidentologist.  Yeah.  Whatever.  That's cool.  Phil,  what's going on?  Hey,  what's up,  ONA?  Good show today.  Opie.  I'm glad you're all right,  man.  Thank you.  Listen,  I think I have an idea about the seatbelt.  It's possible you were wearing a seatbelt.  And I'll tell you why.  The way the mechanism works is it's like a little pendulum.  And when you slam on the brakes,  that pendulum goes forward locking the feeder mechanism.  So it's possible if you were hit from the side,  the pendulum wasn't effective and the seatbelt wasn't,  wasn't effective either.  I really, 
[00:51:30]  you know,  it's,  it's kind of foggy.  I really don't know if I was wearing a seatbelt.  I'll be wearing a seatbelt every time.  But tell me that airbags.  Because I'm one of these guys that,  you know,  if I'm going a mile around my town or a quick trip to 7-Eleven or something.  Oh, boy.  I don't need a seatbelt.  Seatbelts are made for those longer trips when you're going to visit grandma or something.  You got to.  It sounds to me like you weren't wearing the seatbelt,  but it is possible you were.  All right,  Phil,  I got to wear them all the time.  We got to say hi to the guy that almost killed me Friday,  Friday afternoon.  Brother Waze. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah,  baby,  I thought maybe I'd come to New York and get me a radio show.  Waze,  what the hell are you doing,  man?  You can't kill my partner here.  Man,  that would have been terrible.  That would have sucked.  Now,  I did his show this morning because I was still up there.  I just flew in.  And,  man,  Waze,  you had some funny things to say when I was listening before I got there.  It was before my nap.  Tell Anthony the first thought in your mind when the car hit.  Boy,  I'm killing Opie.  Oh, 
[00:52:30]  I'm killing Opie.  Andy,  for crying out loud,  you guys get the big deal.  We work for the same company.  The kid comes up.  He's in,  he's in Rochester for a half an hour and we have a horrendous accident and I got to be driving.  Waze kills Opie.  Oh my God.  That would have sucked.  You'd have been trashed in the CBS company.  Now,  remember,  we were going to the restaurant,  right?  We's at this point,  he's kind of hungry,  so he tries to put the blame on his wife.  He goes,  hey,  Doreen,  you tell him you were driving.  I'm hungry. 
[00:53:00]  I don't want to wait out there in the frigging heat for them cops.  Sitting in a parking lot,  asphalt,  toothless crack addicts,  giving us ice cubes.  Yeah.  Anthony's laughing at me because I didn't worry about Sandy at first.  I jumped out of the car and had to check my ass.  I'm thinking the first thing you do is you turn around,  you look in the back seat to your chick and you go,  hey,  are you okay?  Yeah.  Waze,  what's up?  Well,  my wife,  as usual,  now they're on the phone with babies screaming.  That's good. 
[00:53:30]  Beautiful.  Yeah.  No,  but I told Anthony that I jumped out of the car to check my ass.  You got to check your own ass before you worry about anyone else,  right?  Thank you.  Hold on,  man.  This is a story of my frigging life.  You could turn around and ask your girl if she's okay.  Ant,  you're not thinking straight.  It's like you were fleeing the scene,  saving your own ass real quick,  and then once you realize you're okay,  all right,  now I can go back.  You know,  what if there was a split second before the gas tank blew? 
[00:54:00]  You know,  you got to pull your girl out and be the hero.  Right.  You got to save your own ass.  Say,  Waze did the same thing.  I hear you two are out of the car.  Your girls are still in the vehicle.  Ant,  his wife pounding on the window.  How did that look?  How did it look looking into the eyes of your wife pounding on the window?  Oh,  my God.  That's awful.  Praise the Lord,  Mike.  You have to check your own ass,  right,  Waze?  Yeah,  I just had to come downstairs to tell the old lady to hang up the phone with the babies.  Does anyone know where Sam Kinison must have said the most genius words ever when someone 
[00:54:30]  asked him if he knows what hell is like?  I've been married for two effing years.  Oh,  my God.  You're trying to do a little radio with us and the wife has to get on the extension with  the kids,  right?  I think I'm listening to you and I'm listening to my babies going,  yeah,  yeah,  yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  Oh,  God damn.  He's in hell.  In hell.  So,  yeah,  Waze,  it was,  I told the whole story pretty much. 
[00:55:00]  Hey,  well,  listen,  all I know is,  you know,  I would have been working for Clear Channel and Anthony would have been peddling.  Yeah,  I don't know what I did.  Somebody's asked me,  Ant,  what would you do if Opie had died?  I don't know.  I,  I guess I'd join Ron and Fez.  Oh,  what am I going to do?  I got it.  I got to move on.  I'd take a week.  You know,  I'd take a week for the memorials and,  you know,  Fox TV to do the special on Greg Huggins and his dad.  Right.  Greg Huggins.  But Weez was just as bad. 
[00:55:30]  He jumped out and checked his ass before helping us out of the car.  I wasn't getting out of my side.  I think everybody jumps out and checks their own ass before they jump into action.  Yeah.  I don't know.  When you could just turn around and see if your girls are bloody messes in the backseat or not.  He didn't see Sandy.  Thought she went flying.  Really?  Oh,  yeah.  When I,  when I let my old lady out of the backseat in the smoke in there,  I couldn't,  there was nobody else in there.  Sandy could fly through the fly window.  You got to watch out there.  If that's open to cracks,  she'll go through.  And then the potato chips all over the road. 
[00:56:00]  It was,  it was,  it was,  the potato chips didn't last the crash.  The chips are on the ground.  Hey,  did you tell,  did you tell,  did you tell Andy about the fine Susan Tedeski performance yesterday?  No,  I'm going to talk about that later.  Do a little bit of that,  please.  Yeah,  we're going to try to get her on the radio or something,  but hey,  I got to ask you,  did you see that car at all?  No,  no.  Yeah,  that's kind of a tough move,  making that left through a traffic like that.  Well,  there was two lanes of cars that were waving us through and then bang,  no seeing nothing.  And where were the waving people after it happened? 
[00:56:30]  Everyone takes off.  Not one person stopped.  The waving sons of bitches.  They,  they just go on.  Ooh,  Ooh,  what did I do?  They probably felt really guilty and said,  oh man,  we got to get the F out of here.  Yeah.  They're going to blame me.  Of course.  They never stopped.  You should slap those people in the face.  You don't wave people on.  You don't know what the hell's coming.  I knew my nose was bad when a crackhead comes up to me and goes,  oh,  that's getting swollen.  You got a big nose.  And they had big noses from the drugs and the drinking. 
[00:57:00]  Hey,  take this.  You should tell people because no one ever thinks about this.  If you are somebody that waves people through,  which I've done myself,  you got to be looking,  you got to be looking out your right mirror for these people to say,  okay,  it's cool.  Come on.  I've seen people wave me on and I swear to God,  cars are speeding right by him and I flip them the bird.  I go,  no.  And I give them the finger and they look at me like,  what?  Yeah.  You freak.  Oh man.  I always go back to your nap.  Thanks a million fellas.  All right.  Take it easy.  We woke him up for that, 
[00:57:30]  man.  We's is on Saturday nights here on the station in New York.  So someone is asking,  where is she?  Emily.  Hey guys.  How are you doing?  Good.  Oh,  but you haven't even mentioned the people in the other car.  I wish he died.  It sounded like they could have flown right through the window.  I would have happened to that.  He had some fine airbags too.  The guy was okay,  but this was pretty nasty.  And I'm sure there's a bunch of you out there that had this happen to you.  He got burned by the airbags. 
[00:58:00]  Oh yeah.  Oh,  I'm assuming it's burns.  What else could it be?  Is it the friction between the skin and the airbags?  His arms all the way up his forearms to his elbows were just raw.  I'll tell you,  on both sides.  You checked on him before you checked on Sandy?  No,  I didn't even want to talk.  Check on the guy in the other car.  I didn't even want to talk to that guy.  Didn't even want to talk to him.  Because he's sitting there bitching about his 1999 car that only had 12,000 miles. 
[00:58:30]  Because he doesn't drive it in the winter.  He's bitching.  And I'm thinking to myself,  dude,  someone pulled out in front of him.  What do you expect him to do?  But he was speeding under those circumstances.  Who doesn't?  Someone's got to help me.  We got hit going about,  he hit us going at least 50.  The faults here,  all right,  the guy going fast is the bottom part of the fault.  Because unless someone gets in his way as he's going fast,  he's fine.  The waving on people,  asses.  Asses for not stopping either.  Dumb asses.  And we,  I got to say,  he should really be careful. 
[00:59:00]  Totally guilty.  When you're going,  not totally.  I told him on his morning show this morning,  I said,  look,  if that other guy needs a witness,  I'm here.  Because I go,  you're guilty,  my friend.  Look at my nose.  You're guilty.  The waving on people.  Ugh.  You should be on the phone.  It's an opiate after the crash.  Lewis.  Lewis.  Hey,  dude,  thank God you're okay.  But you know,  you're like to.  I can hear the sincerity in that.  Not really.  I'm happy you're okay.  But you know,  you're like the Ted Kennedy of the WNEW. 
[00:59:30]  Arrah.  Stay right there,  Sandy.  I'm going to go get help.  Arrah.  All right.  Hey,  you know.  All right.  Lewis comes out with a funny one.  Think about it this way,  Opie.  Now he'll wreck it.  Now he'll wreck it.  Go ahead.  Hey,  Opie,  with that huge bump on your nose,  now you can do mornings.  Ooh.  Gross.  Hey,  there you go.  He kind of skated by the second one.  You know what?  I'm hanging up on him before he wrecks his streak.  He'll wreck it.  He'll wreck it.  If the new cities don't know,  that guy's hit or miss.  That is pretty funny.  Most of the time,  miss. 
[01:00:00]  That is good,  though.  I got to leave.  Opie just leaves the car.  It's Sandy in the back seat  with Weezy's wife pounding on the rear window.  I was in a diner down the street.  I got to get out of this vehicle.  I need some food.  I'm hungry.  I got to see if numero uno is okay.  Oh,  man.  I don't feel bad about it.  Dazed and confused.  You got to make sure your own ass is okay at that point.  That's all right.  You're not going to help anyone if you're paralyzed.  Oh,  that's it. 
[01:00:30]  Doug.  Yeah.  Hey.  What's up,  man?  What's up?  I used to work at a car dealer.  We had to explode them airbags before we could send them back.  Hey,  go Sox.  Go Sox.  Right?  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  Go Sox.  What's up with the airbag burn?  Dude,  man,  things would go up about 50 feet,  and you can't touch them for about 10 minutes because of the face of them,  because of the explosion that sends them open.  It makes it so hot that you can't,  that's what the burn's from.  It's not from any chemicals. 
[01:01:00]  It's from that.  And there is a rash that you can get from the chemicals.  Oh,  it was nasty.  Yeah,  it gets hot.  All right.  Yeah,  go Sox.  All right.  There's no ma.  Thank you.  Take it easy.  Do you want to go with the physics question?  We'll do one physics question.  I know we have to take a break.  Gerard.  Yo.  Hey.  How you doing?  Good.  I think I have an answer for you.  I'm in the middle of a lawsuit now.  I was hit by a tractor trailer.  Okay?  I was hit by a tractor trailer doing 55 miles or I was doing 45 miles an hour. 
[01:01:30]  The breaking distance of the tractor trailer at 55 miles an hour is 300 yards.  I was pushed into a guardrail.  Had a broken femur bone, broken pelvis, broken hip.  Knocked my teeth out.  Ouch.  And according to my lawsuit,  it's 300 yards at 55 miles an hour when I was doing 40 miles an hour.  Wow.  I don't know if that's going to help you out, Andy.  That would help two vehicles moving.  Yeah.  One vehicle not moving.  Very important to our physics question.  Some guy checked in, said it was somewhere between 43 or 48 and 53 miles an hour. 
[01:02:00]  So I nailed it at 50.  And the guy goes, oh, I did try to put on the brake, which means he was going fast.  Because there was not much of a skid mark on the road.  How?  I mean, we surprised him like a mother F because we were just there out of nowhere.  Pop in there.  There's nowhere to go.  How?  Yo.  Yo.  What's up?  Two quick things.  Quick F you to those people, the waivers,  because some dude did that when a good family friend was, like, crossing a school bus. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  And a car came flying from the other lane.  Don't wave.  Seriously.  And it killed her, man.  It's really, really effed up.  But second of all...  Watch out for those courtesy waivers.  Yeah, seriously.  All right.  Second of all, I think if you would have died, Anthony would have been like Siskel and Ebert.  He would have just picked up somebody, like, two weeks later.  Oh, I just got some other guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  At least wait a while, Ant.  Not like Ebert or Siskel, whatever one that is still alive. 
[01:03:00]  Did you see what Ebert did, though?  He didn't even miss a taping of his show.  No.  And it was Siskel and Ebert.  And then when Siskel died, now it's Ebert and Roper.  He got the top spot.  But you know the Opie Anthony thing is not a top spot.  I know, but it would be Anthony and whoever.  That's all right.  We can call it Anthony and Opie right now.  I don't give a flying app.  I don't think so.  I'm just happy to be alive today.  Happy to...  Do you have a new outlook on life now?  No.  You're not taking a...  No, huh?  No.  Not taking life for granted?  No.  No.  No. 
[01:03:30]  I'm not going to...  Don't care.  Two more calls, Ben.  Calm down.  Kate.  Hi.  Hi.  I just need to call and defend Opie.  Yeah.  I was in a similar accident.  My car went off a bridge, and it was...  I didn't even have airbags.  And I went through the windshield, and my little brother was still in the car.  And the first thing you do is you get up and you go,  Oh, I'm still alive.  Yeah.  It's a nice feeling to know your S isn't too bad.  Well, you barely have time.  You're thinking, Oh, crap.  Here it goes.  And then it's done.  And your brain...  It takes a minute for your brain to click back into where you are. 
[01:04:00]  Right.  So, you know, it wasn't that he was abandoning Sandy.  You would have got her eventually.  Yeah, but you're a girl.  Yeah, well...  Thanks, Kate.  Thanks for trying to help me out.  I don't care if the chick jumps out of the car.  Dana.  Yes.  Dana.  Dana.  Dana.  Dana.  Dana.  Dana.  I was...  Dylan.  I was in the same kind of accident.  I got waved on.  A car waved somebody on, and I was going straight,  and I T-boned a guy going about 40 miles an hour, 
[01:04:30]  and the waivers took off.  The waivers take off, of course.  Yeah, and I got airbag burned, too.  It, like, made a big welt on my arm.  And when I called originally, that's when you guys are talking about that.  It hurts.  At first, I thought there was, like, nitrous going off in my car.  I didn't know what the hell happened.  Yeah, laughing gas or something.  All right.  Thank you, Dana, from Cleveland.  Bye.  You know, when you see these waivers,  a lot of times people feel pressured to turn when they wave you on.  Don't.  Just flip them the bird.  Swear to God.  You see a waiver, flip them the bird. 
[01:05:00]  Beep your horn and mouth out the F-you thing.  All right.  I want to do the nose thing again.  You got to be really quiet.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  I don't know what this means, though, if it's busted or not.  Oh, no.  It hurts like a mother.  My eyes will tear if I do this, but I'm going to do it one more time.  You're going to really screw yourself up,  because you can never leave anything alone.  All right.  Here we go.  Be quiet, right?  Oh.  You hear that?  Yeah.  Don't do it anymore. 
[01:05:30]  Hey.  Stop it.  One more time.  Oh, God.  That is disgusting.  Can you hear it, kind of?  All right.  Cool.  We'll be back.  We're still stupid.  Well, if that's what it takes to get good ratings, we'll continue being stupid.  We don't care.  We don't care.  I've been expecting you to make exactly that asinine statement.

[01:08:00]  Dwayne, you're next.  What's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I was a waver in one of those accidents.  Dick.  Hold on now.  Before you kill me, I did try to warn the lady before she crossed over and got creamed by a Suburban.  Man, that is...  I never even thought about the courtesy accident thing.  But, man, I'm going to look twice now.  Oh, it caught me first.  It caught me by, you know, the short and curly.  I was not expecting anyone coming out on the inside. 
[01:08:30]  And you know what?  You were waving someone?  I was waving her on.  And I looked over in the right passenger mirror in the car.  And I saw another dude coming in a Suburban.  I'm like, oh, crap.  So I started honking the horn, trying to stop her.  I honked the horn.  The moron, the lady, looks at me instead of the road and pulls out into a Suburban.  She was out in this little, like, light blue Mazda Miata and got creamed.  How fast did you leave?  Oh, no, I stayed.  I stayed.  I'm not a dick. 
[01:09:00]  I stayed.  Yeah, you are.  That was cool.  That was cool to stay.  But, I mean, she was just pulling out of Dunkin' Donuts.  There was coffee and it was a stench of, like, coffee and smoke from the airbags.  It was ridiculous.  All right, Dwayne.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Bye.  Bye.  I hope George helps me out with something here.  I got to explain after George's call.  George, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  All right.  Listen, I got a story that relates a little bit to Opie, how you feel.  Yeah.  Me and my brother and a couple of friends were going to the movies a little while back.  And it was still a little bit cold out, but we only had the windows open, like, halfway. 
[01:09:30]  And we were driving in town and some guy just cut us off and we wound up, you know, colliding head on.  And everybody was all scared, nervous.  We were looking around and my brother was nowhere to be found.  Everybody was going crazy looking for him.  So what happened to him, my brother, he jumped out the open window and took off.  He ran home.  We lived about 10 blocks away from the accident.  He ran all the way home.  Everybody was going crazy looking for him.  So I can relate to Opie, you know, worrying about yourself first. 
[01:10:00]  Well, no.  Because of that.  I mean, we're having fun here and we're joking and stuff a little bit over something that was pretty scary for me on Friday.  No joke.  Yeah.  A bunch of idiots are riding and going, you know, I can't believe you just thought of yourself.  Well, you've got to understand something.  When you're in something like that, and a lot of people could back me on this, you don't even know that anyone else is in the car.  You're like, holy ass, what the freak just happened?  Your mind gets scrambled.  And, of course, I jumped out, checked my ass, and then, of course, I realized that there were two more people still in the car.  And I actually poked my head in the driver's side door and said, come out this way. 
[01:10:30]  But you're right.  It took a few seconds.  I'm not going to lie.  But you're like, what the F?  You get scrambled.  I got you okay, though, guys.  Hey, thank you.  I got you okay, because I don't know what I would listen to every day driving home if you were hurt.  It would be the Anthony show.  Oh, no.  I don't know.  It would only be half a study.  Nah.  Not bad.  All right, George.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Thanks.  Bye.  You know, I mean, all kidding aside, of course, when I snap back to reality, I realized there were more people. 
[01:11:00]  And, yeah, you do what you can.  Right.  The look of seeing one of them just pounding out the window as the whole car is smoking.  That's awful.  Woo!  Paul Mercurio wants in real fast here.  Hey, Paul.  What's up?  Hey, how's it going?  Our friend from Comedy Central, The Daily Show.  Hi, guys.  You're alive and well, Opie?  First accident ever.  And you know what?  I don't want to go through one of those any time.  Yeah, you sound like the kind of guy I want to be stuck on a mountaintop with.  You'll start eating me in a heartbeat when I kick him in.  Oh, I could. 
[01:11:30]  I was so in my own stuff, I couldn't.  I forgot there were other people in the car.  Imagine, hey, Opie, what are you doing?  I'm still alive.  I'm still.  Yeah, but I'm hungry.  Opie's like, oh, dude, you're bleeding all over me.  You're ruining the weather.  Everything's cool.  I was up in Montreal with Louis Black.  Oh, for the comedy festival?  The comedy festival.  Nice.  He has a vagina.  Why?  Because he's like so into clothes now.  First it was a sofa that he took four months to buy a sofa.  Now he's up there and he's always obsessing about his shopping for clothes. 
[01:12:00]  You've got to go to the store and shop for clothes.  I said, what happened to you?  You're like a 55-year-old AARP guy.  He's like walking around with these new shoes and a bad suit jacket.  And he goes, I got this for 40 off, 40 off.  I said, Luke, I'm telling you, I hope he's listening.  You should call in.  The guy has lost his mind.  He's got to buy a rug now.  We're going to have to suffer through that.  He's buying a rug for his apartment.  He's an elitist.  Oh, I thought you meant for his head.  And I'm thinking, I don't remember him losing hair. 
[01:12:30]  He's an elitist now, right?  He's totally walking around with these like pointing Wayne Newton shoes up there.  He's totally lost his mind.  He has all these great socialist ideas, and it turns out he's just another one of these rich guys.  He turned his back on the socialist ideas years ago.  I swear he's got two young boys, nubile boys in his apartment who just take care of him.  Oh, Paul.  Just a visual you just gave us.  I had so much fun the last time I was on with Brewer.  Yeah.  That was a blast.  One of the best shows we've done lately. 
[01:13:00]  You guys killed that day for us.  Well, you too, man.  You remember that laugh you did on that woman when she called in from the Big Brother show?  Yeah, that was great.  Oh, my God.  I think we replayed that over the weekend.  Oh, really?  It was pretty funny.  Yeah, so Montreal was fun, and I'm doing Caroline's tonight.  I'm headlining.  Oh, cool.  That's right.  So I'm doing a shameless plug for myself.  That is shameless.  Hey, when's your show tonight?  The show's at 9.30.  Oh, man.  Caroline's.  I'm going to try to go.  Try, yeah.  If not, you know, that's cool. 
[01:13:30]  We'll catch you next time.  Yeah, and so now I missed part of it.  Was the car totaled?  Oh, yeah.  There's going to be pictures sent down.  Is this the Lexus?  I don't have a Lexus.  That's the one you've been driving that they gave you to drive, and like a whore you say  on the air that it's a great car.  We haven't had those in a while.  They just gave it to us for a little while.  Yeah, they had the last Lexus.  Yeah.  I haven't had one since I was doing donuts in the parking lot of governors.  You should have saw how I gave that one back. 
[01:14:00]  Did you really?  Oh, man.  And then a cop pulled him over.  Yeah, it was good.  All right.  Can you guys hook me up with a car deal?  I'm looking for one.  We're all looking for one.  Get your own, dude.  Get Lewis to get you a car.  He's too busy buying underwear and lace T-shirts.  He's a freak, and he's got a pile of it floating around his body, and he says it's gone, but  it's floating around.  He's got a little angry Jew inside of him moving around. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, my God.  We got so drunk Saturday night at the party.  You should have seen him Sunday morning.  He made a sheet look like it had color.  It was terrible.  It's like just the most pasty-looking Jew cruising around Montreal.  I love him, but, you know, he's a mess.  Who am I to talk?  I went out there with my wife.  She was pretty cool.  What's your problem with Lewis?  No, I love Lewis.  I hear some anger today.  Did you guys have to bunk together, and you can't stand him anymore? 
[01:15:00]  No, I love him.  He's just such a kiss-ass.  He's a sellout.  He should be giving every dollar that he earns to the poor and the homeless.  Right.  That's what he says.  That's what he says.  But what does he do?  He spends five months buying a sofa, and he goes up to Montreal.  And he buys leather, big, fancy leather shoes.  You should see these shoes he bought.  These are talking about cockroach killers.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Totally PR shoes.  I'm just hoping that Lewis calls to defend himself.  But so far, no dice.  But I kid because I love. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, of course.  All right.  Hey, Paul, we've got to cut you short because we've got to take another break.  We're running late.  All right.  So it's Caroline's Tonight at 930?  Yes.  Thank you for letting me babble on.  No, no problem.  Highly recommend you go see Paul.  Thanks, guys.  Come see us soon, all right?  Yep.  There he goes.  Paul McCurrio from The Daily Show on Comedy Central, Anthony.  Yes.  We've got to get into the Stone Pony story next.  Yeah.  All kinds of accusations going on.  We do these road shows, and they're just wild. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  We admit that.  And we made the town of Asbury Park a lot of money.  And now they're complaining.  And now there's newspaper articles being written about what we did at the road show.  We put Asbury Park, I think it was the first story to come out of Asbury Park that concerned  a lot of people having fun and not some kind of depressing story of a town in turmoil.  And they have a problem with it.  And we'll get into it next, okay?  As we go to break, Anthony?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Thank you, Rick. 
[01:16:30]  You were explaining the whole tornado thing or hurricane thing.  Oh, my God.  Or hurricanes.  It was hurricanes.  Hurricanes.  All right.  We'll explain it next.  Oh, my God.  The New York people will remember Spaz and his theory on how to stop hurricanes.  Yeah.  There may be some truth to what Spaz said.  We all laughed.  Did you find the tape of Spaz?  We got the...  Because what we'll do is we'll play what Spaz thinks we should do with hurricanes.  And then we'll have Anthony explain what he was reading, what, today?  Over the weekend.  Okay, cool.  As we go to break, Anthony, something from the ONA archives that I'm certainly not proud of. 
[01:17:00]  But someone out there wants to hear this.  The Make-A-Wish phone call.  Oh, another cruel Opie bit.  Great.  Another bit that shows Opie's cruel side.  First, he leaves my sister in a smoking car.  And now this.  Dick.  All right.  Well, I want to help my sick kid out.  Make-A-Wish.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[01:17:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Sorry about that.  Hold.  How can I help you?  Hi.  This is John Huber.  I was told to call back after the holidays.  Mm-hmm.  Um, make-wishes happen for sick kids.  Right.  How can we help you?  Well, his son Jonathan is dying. 
[01:18:00]  What state does he live in?  New Hampshire.  Okay.  One moment.  I'm going to give you his local make-a-wish chapter.  Yeah.  Do you do things with, um, celebrities?  Yes.  Where they, they can meet their celebrities and stuff?  Mm-hmm.  We sure do.  Let me give you a phone number.  Are you ready?  Yeah.  He wants to meet, um, Pamela Lay from Baywatch.  Okay.  Um, well, let me give you the phone number to the chapter that would help him.  Do you think that's a possibility? 
[01:18:30]  Um, it depends on, you know, there's a lot of things that it would depend on.  But, first of all, let's get you going on his local chapter.  They're the ones that would be working with him.  All right.  Well, it's just a simple request.  Oh, yeah.  Um, I mean, Jonathan just wants to, to see, um, uh, Pam.  Right.  Okay.  Let me give you this phone number to call.  Let's see Pam, uh, giving me oral favors before he dies.  Okay.  Hold on. 
[01:19:00]  It's a gift of life.  Okay, um, let me give you this phone number.  You think that would be possible?  It might be.  But you need to get it going, so let's give you this phone number and give them a call.  Okay.  It's area code 603.  So you honestly think that he, he could see Pam giving me a b***h?  What?

[01:21:00]  A couple phone lines available.  Give us a call, 866-277-4WOW if you want in today.  So, man, Asbury Park pissed off at us.  Yeah.  What happened?  Dude, that place is, it's in a shambles.  The town of Asbury Park, New Jersey, made famous by Bruce Springsteen.  I mean, you know, he, he's a Jersey guy. 
[01:21:30]  It's like seaside, little community.  No one can imagine how awful this place really is.  It looks like Beirut.  No joke.  It really does.  Just buildings that, the roofs are collapsing.  I'm not talking about one or two.  I'm talking almost the entire town is just horribly in disrepair.  Run down.  Run down, boarded up, holes in the ceilings. 
[01:22:00]  Everything broken.  And the area itself, very bad area.  So, we have our, our road show there.  The last road show we had a couple weeks back at the Stone Pony.  A legendary, uh, club.  And, uh, we had a great time.  3,800 people.  Dickey Betts, Jay.  Oh, yeah, well, everyone knows.  We had a great time.  A lot of stuff going on.  A lot of people from the show coming up on stage.  Had a great time.  Uh, turns out, Asbury Park had a problem with what we were doing. 
[01:22:30]  Had a problem with some of the stuff that was going on in the pool in front of the stage.  Right.  And it's well documented because the pictures have been everywhere at this point.  Right.  You can go to www.wnew.com and see pictures.  You go to foundrymusic.com, see the pictures and the video clips for yourself.  An unbelievable time.  But, you know something?  What's wrong if a few girls want to get naked and jump in a kiddie pool and play around with each other?  What the hell is wrong with that? 
[01:23:00]  Uh, there's like a law or something.  Screw that law.  Nudity and alcohol in the same place.  What's wrong with that?  They didn't seem to have a problem with alcohol and guns in the same place, in the same city.  A week after we were there.  A week after we were there.  There was a full-out riot.  Yeah.  Or so it seems.  We reported that last week, right?  We did report that right here on Opie and Anthony, on the Opie and Anthony show.  You're a news leader.  Yes.  Opie and Anthony.  We made the town an S-load of money where we ran out of a lot of brands of beer. 
[01:23:30]  You know, if you want to open up, reopen this town as some kind of entertainment complex  and a town that people might want to take their family to, family, well, just an entertainment town,  which it used to be back in, like, the 40s and 50s,  you want people to come in that aren't usually there,  because the only people that are there usually are crackheads and people that shoot each other.  So we bring our listeners there and had a great time in Asbury Park at the Stone Pony. 
[01:24:00]  I think we brought in more money that day than the whole town has for a year.  Yeah.  I would like to see those figures, and I bet you it's not a huge exaggeration.  So now we've got police directors and city council people that are just upset with what we did  and what was going on at the Stone Pony.  You want to read the first one?  Yeah, let's read the first one.  Here's from the Asbury Park Press on the 20th. 
[01:24:30]  Cops may pin charge on bar.  A famous musical venue, maybe in hot water after a pool party,  which some women allegedly removed their clothes and wrestled in the water.  Wrestled? Is that what you call it?  Okay, if you want to call it wrestling.  They were wrestling with faces in the dirty places.  The July 7th afternoon party at the Stone Pony was sponsored by WNEW 102.7  and New York radio station, which said it drew some 4,000 people, mostly women. 
[01:25:00]  There's the first wrong thing.  Mostly women.  And featured shock jocks, Greg Opie Hughes.  We're shock jocks.  And Anthony Cumia.  We're so shocking.  Of the Opie and Anthony show.  Asbury Park police director, Michael W. Dowling,  said many onlookers witnessed women wrestling naked in a small plastic pool.  Doesn't that sound cool?  Doesn't that sound like something you want to go and see?  I'd go there. 
[01:25:30]  Hell yeah.  Dowling added that pictures of the event were posted on WNEW's website,  which will now be pounded.  Well, he downloaded, which he downloaded as evidence.  Yeah, let me download some of this evidence.  Yeah.  Is that what you tell the wife?  I do that all the time.  I'm just downloading evidence.  You also have some evidence in your pants right now.  Yeah.  He said he and city attorney Mitchell J. Ansell will review the pictures, I'm sure.  Well, I'm viewing some pictures right now. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  Look at picture 14, 21, 22.  Look at the evidence.  Oh, look at that evidence.  Oh, wow.  Well, we don't know that picture was taken at the Stone Pony in all fairness.  Nice evidence.  That could be someone's backyard party.  How do we know that was happening at the Stone Pony?  Look at that picture.  Oh, my God.  The pictures also show people drinking, which is a violation of state law that prohibits  nudity in a place serving alcoholic beverages.  But is it safe to say that if the retard Laverne and Shirley get naked, is it really nudity? 
[01:26:30]  No.  Then there's no law against booze and an atrocity taking place, which is what that was.  Oh.  Oh.  All right.  Now, there, I agree.  There should be a law against that.  That's, I think, big, but Mendy getting naked.  Dowling said an investigation is continuing and charges could be filed.  Oh.  Ouch.  Oh.  And here's one of Dowling's quotes.  I would like to see the Stone Pony be the Stone Pony. 
[01:27:00]  That's what Dowling said, referring to its early days as Bruce Springsteen's showcase.  I want to see the Stone Pony continue to be a place where people can come to hear original  music and have a good time, not this type of entertainment.  How about you'd like to see the Stone Pony in a town that isn't like it's been bombed out,  like it hasn't been under artillery fire for years?  Because that's what Asbury Park looks like.  Stone Pony has much bigger problems than Opie and Anthony.  Right.  Look at the surrounding area. 
[01:27:30]  The guy that runs the place is doing a great job trying to get people into that venue and  into that town, which is just a friggin' mess, that town, and we go there, bring a bunch  of listeners that normally wouldn't give Asbury Park the time of day, and we have fun.  Yes, we did have a lot of fun.  I give credit to the owner of the Stone Pony because he told the story last week that somebody  pulled out his black worm, can we say that? 
[01:28:00]  Yeah.  And proceeded to do something on his window, tinkle on his window, while they were trying  to eat breakfast.  And he still wants to stay in that town because he still believes in Asbury Park.  And the town shoves it right up his you-know-what.  Yeah, because he was bitching about the Greek fest they had, but we'll get into that a little  later.  Finish the article here.  He wants the type of entertainment that the Stone Pony used to put on, back in the early  days, before the artillery shelling.  Jeremy Coleman, the director of promotions for N.E.W., he's the promotions director. 
[01:28:30]  Did he get demoted?  Well, yeah, with my new title.  That's right.  They had to give him something.  Ooh.  No, I'm just kidding.  He's probably less.  He's the program director, not director of promotions for N.E.W.  Said he was aware of the nude photos on the website.  All right.  Very good.  Uh, Coleman, here it is.  Uh, we have a lot of female fans, Coleman said.  Uh, and there's a big perception that we're for guys, but most of our fans are women.  Now, what? 
[01:29:00]  He told me he was misquoted.  Now, that is a misquote by far.  No, we do have women fans, but most of our fans are men.  We love the female listeners.  Of course.  Wish more would show up at our events.  They just get everything wrong.  He's not the promotions director.  And he did not say, most of our fans are women.  We're mostly fans of women.  I'll say that.  Yeah.  Um, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  Um...  And that was pretty much it.  Yeah. 
[01:29:30]  Let me...  Oh, no.  Here it goes.  Oh.  Dowling said that, um...  After Dominic Santana, owner of the Stone Pony, was awarded the application to host the event, Santana promised both the police department and the city council no illegal activity would occur at the venue.  He promised nothing would happen, and it did, said Dowling, who reported that there were several citations handed out and two arrests that evening.  Two arrests out of 4,000 people?  Not too shabby.  Nobody died.  Well, councilwoman Kate Molina said after she heard about what happened at the Stone Pony, she visited Santana at his home. 
[01:30:00]  I reamed him out, Molina exclaimed.  Asbury Park doesn't need this type of image.  Oh, man.  You stupid twat!  What?  You know the image your town has?  Have you looked around?  Your town is a disaster area.  But she gave him a good reaming.  I reamed him out.  Did she see the guy with the big black worm hanging out the window when she visited his home from Greek Fest? 
[01:30:30]  A week after we were there at the Stone Pony and had 4,000 people having a great time, they had something called Greek Fest, which originally started, I guess, as a bunch of black college students coming into town to party.  It happens all over the country.  They have these things.  Well, it's degraded into 3,000 or 4,000 people that don't go to school, hanging out and just starting trouble.  We read an article about it last week. 
[01:31:00]  Gunfire, chasing people down the streets, shooting each other.  Machine gun fire out of SUVs.  Sexual assaults reported.  Sexual assaults.  People laying in the street.  One guy was shot in the hip.  They found him hours later.  He didn't die, but he's laying there with his own gun a foot away from his hand as he's laying in the street pleading.  It was like the Old West.  And I saw one article about that with no one getting blamed.  No one trying to pin anybody with the blame for that.  And I do believe no one got reamed out for that one. 
[01:31:30]  You know who should have gotten reamed out?  Councilwoman Kate Molina should have gotten reamed out for allowing that to even go on.  But no, because then you'll come across as maybe being a racist if you say that a bunch of black people can't come into your town to party and shoot it up.  The bottom line is we had a lot of people there having a damn good time, drinking, having fun in the kiddie pool.  Yeah, sure.  But that's the American way.  And are you going to go against America? 
[01:32:00]  Animal House.  Maria, I know.  Maria.  Hi, guys.  How are you doing?  We're doing all right.  Good.  I just wanted to let you know that I guess it was last year about this time, the New York Times and the New Jersey section actually had an entire article on how Asbury Park is becoming like the next gay resort town.  Like a lot of gay people are moving in and buying up property.  Why would a self-respecting fag want to go to a town like that?  They're buying up most of like the northern part and then I guess moving down. 
[01:32:30]  That's the biggest gamble going on in Asbury Park.  A lot of developers and stuff are buying property now.  They're banking, gambling on the fact that it might pick up.  Hey, take $20,000, you know, go buy a piece of property and make your money back tenfold in like 50 years.  Yeah, 50 years.  If the town ever gets its crap in order.  But it's not going to.  Not with people like her in charge.  It's never going to get back to its former glory.  Give it up.  Make it a parking lot for a beach town down the coast.  Jim, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Love the show.  Thank you.  I used to work at the Stone Pony. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  You guys apparently haven't checked out their website recently.  Huh?  Oh, it's a good one.  He's blaming it on you guys.  On the website?  Santana is blaming it on you guys.  Well, that leads us to the second article about the incident.  Thank you, Jim, for the setup.  All right.  So then that was, what, July 20th or so?  20th.  Yeah.  Another day later, we're in the paper again.  Uh-huh.  Stone Pony owner says accusations are retaliation. 
[01:33:30]  Retaliation.  Because when we were talking about the Greek Fest and the shootings and the crime and rapes and gunfire in the streets of Asbury Park,  Dominic called us up to comment on how that was handled.  He said the police didn't do a good job handling the crowd and the gunfire that was taking place during the Greek Fest.  He said at one point, him and his daughter are sitting eating breakfast when the Greek Fest is going on. 
[01:34:00]  A black guy comes to the window, whips out his junk, and starts relieving himself on their window.  Oh, and he says, what the hell's the problem?  The cops aren't there to fix that.  So then now the cops turn around and the city council turns around and now tries to screw him over for what we did at the Stone Pony for the road show  because he criticized the cops and the city council for their handling of Greek Fest. 
[01:34:30]  When you got some black guy peeing on your window, you know something?  Maybe it's not being handled properly.  So we had it all in one location, everyone having fun, and that pool was entertaining.  That pool was genius.  So read the second article.  That's right.  Wet lesbians never killed anybody.  Because now the owner of the Stone Pony is swearing that he was misquoted, Anthony.  Yeah.  Okay, here it is.  A day after being accused of allowing nudity and lewd acts at his bar, Stone Pony owner Dominic Santana 
[01:35:00]  called the accusations a politically motivated attack on my reputation.  Didn't Psycho Mark use that same line about trying to get his money here?  A politically motivated attack on my reputation.  He also said city police officers were present as part of the security detail at the radio station sponsored event.  Santana defended his role in the July 7th incident, an outdoor event sponsored by NEW,  hosted by Shock Jocks Gray, O.P. Hughes, and Anthony Cumia of the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Encouraged women to remove their clothing, engage in nude wrestling, and perform sex acts in a plastic pool. 
[01:35:30]  Does this sound like a party you want to go to?  It sounds like one I want to be at.  That, according to city police director Michael W. Dowling.  Santana said he was in his office doing paperwork and didn't witness the event.  All right, well, you've got to say what you've got. 
[01:36:00]  O.P., he left the vehicle to see if he was okay.  That's it.  He left the vehicle to see if he was okay.  Read that line again.  I just want to make sure we don't misquote that one.  Santana said he was in his office doing paperwork and didn't witness the event.  Which event?  The whole event.  Oh, my God.  And now there's a quote.  There is no way I would condone such behavior, Santana said. 
[01:36:30]  There's no way I would condone such behavior, Santana said.  I have too much at stake to allow something like this to happen.  The event lasted five hours from noon to 5 p.m.  Santana said about 57 security guards, including 15 Asbury Park police officers, were at the event. 
[01:37:00]  City officials require the hiring of the officers, additional security before granting approval.  Santana noted that information regarding charges against the musical venue came one day after he criticized Dowling's handling of the mayhem of the so-called Greek Fest.  Santana made the criticism during the city council meeting Wednesday and on our show.  And Dowling then told the council he was investigating the July 7th incident at the bar.  I think it's ironic he would release this type of information after my comments about Greek Fest, Santana said. 
[01:37:30]  And this is a total abuse of power.  And then it goes on to say more about the website, how they're downloading evidence.  And then it says Santana said he.  Wait, wait, wait.  Yeah.  The pictures.  All right.  They're reviewing the pictures.  The pictures also show people drinking.  State law prohibits nudity in a place serving alcoholic beverages.  OK.  I thought it was more than that. 
[01:38:00]  Sorry.  Santana said he was aware of the photos, but he refuses to look at them and says he no longer will do business with WNEW.  The station previously sponsored several concerts at the bar, he said.  Santana added that he may sue the radio station for breach of contract and said next year they will not be welcomed back to the Stone Pony.  Oh, wow.  That's a drag.  I thought he was our friend and stuff.  What happened?  We were all having fun.  Folded like a cheap tent on us. 
[01:38:30]  How did it happen?  Oh, no.  Folded like a cheap tent, I think, eh?  Nudity.  Bell.  Yeah.  Wow.  Now, what does the website say?  I haven't gotten on their website.  I printed it.  Oh, you did?  All right.  I print up the website.  Let me see what, uh, is there some kind of disclaimer on their website or something?  Disclaimer?  Sally Kramer? 
[01:39:00]  You know, I don't know.  If you want to blame it on us, fine.  If you don't want us back, fine.  I don't know when you're getting 4,000 people in the club again.  4,000 peaceful, fun-loving people that like getting women in pools.  All right.  You want me to read what's on the website?  Yeah, let's see what's on there as far as, uh, this subject goes.  The Stone Pony needs your help.  Asbury Park City officials consider pressing charges against the club after a recent event.  Club owner calls the charges politically motivated and asks fans to call and write letters of support. 
[01:39:30]  On July 7th, the Stone Pony hosted the O&A Roadshow, hosted by radio station NEW, according to Asbury City Police Director, blah, blah, blah, Dowling, uh, as reported in the Asbury Park, ah, Park Press.  You moved it up too fast.  Where am I?  Ah!  Uh, the hosts of the show encouraged women to remove their clothing, engage in nude wrestling, and perform sex acts in a plastic pool.  Photos of the event were later posted on the WNEW.com website.  Because of these actions, city officials are considering pressing charges against the club for violating state law that prohibits nudity in places serving alcoholic beverages. 
[01:40:00]  City council, uh, council member, that Kate Molina, was very critical of the event, claiming that Asbury Park doesn't need this type of, uh, image.  Uh, and then the owner of the Stone Pony promised nothing would happen, and it did.  That's, uh, Dominic Santana.  50, uh, it's the same story that's in the paper.  Where does it, where does it go on to?  Four people. 
[01:40:30]  Uh, okay.  In an email to club supporters, Mr. Santana released the following statement.  The Stone Pony has always been known for their community-minded stance.  Sometimes this meant that we had to express our unpopular opinions.  That has not gone over so, too well with some, uh, some, with some self-serving city officials who are trying to use the Stone Pony as a political pawn to gain office.  The witch hunt has been going on for quite a while, but has escalated after a recent NAW-sponsored ONA event.  Rather than shut our doors and go away, we are asking for you, our friends and supporters, to mail the Asbury Park Council members and tell them of your positive experience here at the Stone Pony. 
[01:41:00]  We appreciate all of your help and need a strong show of support to help us endeavor.  Well, what's the part where the guy is, like, trashing us?  Yeah.  All right, he's not trashing us on the website, right?  So that's the latest.  I'm just reading how they're handling the, uh, Greek Fest thing now. 
[01:41:30]  This woman, this, uh, Melina woman?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, my God, she tiptoes around this one.  Oh, what a bitch!  Right.  We're going to look into the, um, Greek Fest problem.  It deserves a response.  With us, it's like, oh, my God, there's nudity, we've got to do this, blah, blah, blah.  With gunfire in the streets, it deserves a response.  And ladies getting sexually assaulted.  No one got sexually assaulted at our event. 
[01:42:00]  The violence that took place, leaving four people wounded by gunshots, others robbed, carjacked, and raped.  Nice.  And then, because, you know why?  Because the city council gets all scared that people are going to pull out the race card if you criticize something like Greek Fest.  Oh, my God.  I was raised in a white town, and I'm down here seeing them treat black children differently.  They're shooting at them.  They're shooting at each other. 
[01:42:30]  It's numbers, not color.  If it was a gang of white kids, the same thing can happen.  I think we're just caught between, uh, Dominic Santana, the owner of the Stone Pony, and, uh...  Yeah.  ...and the local government down there.  Town council.  All right, we'll see how this plays out in the coming days.  But Dominic is swearing that he was misquoted and that he'll continue doing business with us.  We'll see.  We'll see how that goes.  We will see.  I thought he'd call in, but I guess not.  I thought he would, too. 
[01:43:00]  Maybe he doesn't want, um, doesn't want to have his voice on our show.  Unbelievable.  There you go.  Asbury Park.  Doing even more to keep themselves in, uh, the great shape that that town's in.  And we were doing the town a favor.  We didn't have to go to Asbury Park.  Oh, please.  Yeah.  Didn't have to go there.  A bunch of people opened up to, uh, Asbury Park.  Most of our listeners said, why the hell are you going there?  I know.  Remember the calls we got?  Dude, where are you going?  Uh, Asbury Park. 
[01:43:30]  Have you been there?  Do you know what this place is?  No, what?  Asbury Park.  Remember?  Greetings from Asbury Park.  Bruce Springsteen, right?  Yeah.  It's supposed to be really cool.  It's like a hip place.  No, dude.  Let me tell you.  It's Beirut.  Sarajevo by the sea, they call it.  All right.  I thought someone was on the hotline, but I guess not.  We should take a break, Ant.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, yeah, we'll continue this.  Got to talk about the man-boob contest.  Yeah.  Oh, there's a man-boob contestant here.  Hey! 
[01:44:00]  So we'll explain that, and we got to explain the hurricane theory, and...  I'm done with that, man.  More to come on the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, they're close, baby!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Yeah, sure.  Anthony Pinnacle, horny goat wave.  How's that sex life of yours, huh?  Yeah, but a lot of people love to find a way to make their sex more fun and fulfilling.  Try Pinnacle Horny Goatweed.  It's the name of the herb.  The guys at Pinnacle didn't make it up. 
[01:44:30]  It's called Horny Goatweed.  Pinnacle Horny Goatweed.  It's a botanical complex, and it's designed to enhance libido and sexual performance.

[01:45:30]  New York.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Give us a call, 866-277-4-WOW.  You got instant feedback on the Asbury Park thing yet?  Yeah, one guy says that he lived in Asbury Park.  And people would pull the aluminum siding off of his house to sell it to the local scrap dealer.  And they would pull it off as high as they could reach. 
[01:46:00]  So he'd come out and his aluminum siding would be gone.  And they'd take it down to the scrap yard and sell it.  This town has problems.  It's like something out of The Road Warrior, you know?  The Gooch wants to know, did they mention Dickie Betts made believe his wife was a piÃ±ata?  No, they didn't mention that in the article.  And I don't know if this is true, but Matty writes,  Guys, I was at the Stone Pony about four years ago when Limp Bizkit and Seven Dust played there.  Limp Bizkit had naked chicks in cages dancing on the sides of the stage.  Beer was served and no one gave an F. 
[01:46:30]  Sing.  So what if some naked girls are frolicking in a pool with each other?  I would call that frolicking.  We got away with murder and they're pissed off at us.  I mean, come on, let's say it.  Right?  Well, yeah.  That's not beat around the bush.  Bush.  We got away with murder.  They're like, how dare this happen in our town? 
[01:47:00]  That's what happened.  Sure, I'll admit it.  There were cops there, though.  Asbury Park Police.  Yeah, they seemed to enjoy it.  And the owner, who was doing paperwork, didn't say a thing.  Girls are giving each other tongue baths.  This is great.  In that pool.  Putting their faces in certain places.  That is, oof.  Wow.  We got a guy on the line.  I don't think he's for real, but we'll go with it.  Joe, what's going on?  Joe.  Hello.  What's up?  Yeah, this is Bill.  Hey, Bill, what's up?  Let us just say we don't believe you. 
[01:47:30]  Go ahead.  Well, that's fine.  And believe me, this isn't something I just want to, like, fess up to for no reason.  Dude, I've been doing this since I'm, like, 13 years old.  I'm 29 years old.  And I don't know what the hell it is.  You're claiming that you can shoot stuff from your boobs.  Well, it's, like, kind of like, it's either, it's like a combination of milk or pus or something, man.  I don't know what the hell it is.  Come on, Joe.  Come on.  Dude, I said, Bill, man, Bill.  Ah, Bill, sorry.  Dude, I swear to God.  If you're real and you want it for real and you want to come down, we'll check it out. 
[01:48:00]  Dude, I'm not doing this for nothing, though.  I'm serious.  You get a doctor on the phone and maybe you find out, like, what this might be or something like that.  And you get me maybe, like, some new nips or something and maybe I'll do it.  But my wife don't even know about this.  It looks like you just need some glue or something to clog up the hole.  I don't know what this is, but it seems to me like you would have gone to a doctor before you.  Dude, I swear to God, nothing hurts.  Nothing hurts.  I've been like this forever.  I don't have, like, man boobs.  I'm a big guy. 
[01:48:30]  I'm not bad looking.  And I got not, you know, great pecs or anything.  I got, like, kind of pointy, whatever you want to call it.  But I'm telling you, man.  I'm telling you.  You just need to know if I'm something.  I'll come down there and I'll start something on a piece of tape for you.  All right, hold on.  Disgusting.  I'm going to go on record and say I think the guy's full of ass.  So do I.  You never know.  There's a guy out there that wants in on the man boob competition that has begun today.  Yeah.  A slow start because we haven't really talked about it yet.  But, yeah, we're looking for man boobs. 
[01:49:00]  One of our new sponsors in Philadelphia is willing to give someone a man boob job, which basically means you suck out the stuff that makes it look like a woman's chest.  Yeah.  And make it look all nice again.  If you have the man boobs.  And we're not just talking about big fat guys because there are some guys that aren't really fat, but they have woman's breasts.  Kind of awkward if you go to the beach or something. 
[01:49:30]  Oh, yeah, that's what I heard reported that what?  The Rock?  Oh, The Rock did have this done.  Had this done.  Yeah, it was in one of the articles or something.  He said it on our show.  The Rock says I have man boobs.  The Rock says suck this fat out.  Someone's saying the nipple guy that can shoot stuff has a tumor.  Chris.  Yeah.  What's up?  Yeah, listen, he's probably got something in his head.  He's got something wrong.  His body's actually seen him like he was like a girl or something.  It's not the tumor.  I don't know. 
[01:50:00]  Maybe a doctor can help.  A real doctor.  Yeah, I'm not a real doctor.  All right, thank you.  He just plays one on the radio.  Right.  So we're doing the man boob thing.  All we ask you guys, if you're interested in fixing your problem, you come down, you show  us what you got.  We're going to put your pictures up on the website and the listeners will vote for the  guy that is most pathetic and needs help.  Take that lipo tube.  Turn it sideways.  Stick it in your man boobs.  And suck the fat out.  All right, Rock. 
[01:50:30]  We want to thank Dr. Pistone for helping us out with this.  Oh, yeah.  He does this and he helps you with your thinning hair, too.  I hear he's real good at that.  Gregory Pistone, www.drpistone.com.  Also sponsoring this contest is goldenpalace.com, Anthony.  Yeah.  All right.  And you got a chance to go to Hedonism, too, if you check out goldenpalace.com.  You want to see Big Kevin's twin brother?  Oh, jeez.  He's been to a few of the road shows.  This guy, there's nothing any doctor could do to help this guy. 
[01:51:00]  I think he's done stuff on, what, Ron and Fez, too, right?  Yeah.  The guy's huge.  Yeah, yeah.  You're a big, you are a big gentleman.  What's your name again?  Assman.  Assman?  How tall are you?  About 6'0".  And how much do you weigh?  5'10".  510 pounds.  510 pounds.  Yes, I do.  Wow.  You can still move, man.  Wow.  Yes, I can.  All right, my first observation, the boobs are the smallest thing on your whole damn body.  Right.  Well, you have to get a better look at him from an undressed sort of state. 
[01:51:30]  See, a guy that weighs 510 pounds, and check out his man boobs.  See people.  Get the camera.  I can't wait.  Woo.  When we hang out, a lot of people go, God, I would love to have your job.  What you see.  You know, this is some of the stuff we see that really is a chore.  All right, hold on.  There is a doctor on the line.  We'll see.  Dr. Petillo.  Petillo.  Doc.  Hey, Olin A, second time call.  I was going to give Psycho Patty her exam. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, yeah, okay.  How are you?  Dr. Petillo.  How's everything?  Hey, very good.  Listen, what this man has is very simple.  Males at times are born with milk ducts, which leaves an opening in the actual nipple entrance,  you know, in the actual nipple.  What he has is polyps.  And the polyps, like he said, milk slash plus.  He knows exactly what it is.  It is pus.  He grows polyps.  Now, how I can rectify this is if you have it.  Hello?  Wait a minute.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I know.  He would have this cleaned out, and they would make a small incision under his nipple, as 
[01:52:30]  you would for like a breast implant, and they would sew up the milk duct.  It's very, very common.  He knows exactly what it is.  So he's jerking your chain, telling your milk.  Are you buying it in?  It sounds reasonable.  It's nipple.  It's nip pus?  It's a polyp.  A polyp is almost like a boy.  It grows.  He could have what's called a long-standing polyp, which has kind of wrapped itself around  the milk duct.  Got milk?  And it probably has some form of discharge. 
[01:53:00]  Nice.  You always want to hear the word discharge.  Right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  The nipple guy's back on.  Nipple guy.  Yeah.  You're on with the doc.  Yeah.  Tell Dr. Douchebag to stay there, and I'll be there in about 45 minutes.  I'll spit over his face.  Because I'm not jerking nobody's chain.  I swear to God.  I don't know what this is, man.  I got this for like 15 years.  Nipple guy.  Before you start to use foul and abusive language of somebody who earns what you'll never earn  in a year.  I didn't hear you, sir. 
[01:53:30]  I'm sorry.  I'm going to deliver one baby in about 40 minutes and make more than what you'll earn  in the next two years.  Listen to what I'm telling you.  Are you going to let him suckle on you?  Do you know what I do for a living, sir?  And exactly what nipple...  And exactly what form of medicine do you practice, sir?  Hey, doc.  Why don't you get nipple guy?  What form of medicine do you practice, sir?  And do you have any idea what I might do for a living?  Any or no?  Oh, and A.  Well, it's very common in women also.  Women who don't choose to breastfeed, who take the pills and dry up the milk ducts, okay?  Sometimes they get the polyps. 
[01:54:00]  The same thing.  This man was born with open milk ducts.  He can have it taken care of in a matter of minutes.  Well, would you mind taking care of this for me, though?  I would.  Well, I probably would have had you not come on the way you did.  Hold on, hold on.  What are you talking about?  You're telling me I don't make any money?  You're telling me you make money?  All right, hold on, hold on.  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  They're yelling.  Hold on.  Can I say something?  Yeah, go ahead.  All right, everyone calm down for a second.  And this is going to be surprising, but I'm on nipple guy's side because... 
[01:54:30]  Wow.  Well, it's not easy to have, you know, discharge from the nipple.  How do you come clean them up?  Oh, hey, hold on.  I can't clean them up once.  One time in school.  Forget about it.  I was destroyed for like two months.  Can I give you a phone number of someone at North Shore University Hospital, a very dear  friend of mine, who in fact does reconstructive surgery, who could do that for you?  Is this Dr. Beach Bag?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  It's Lawson.  See, now I'm on the doctor's side. 
[01:55:00]  He ain't going to help you, you talk like that.  Nipple guy, I was on your side, and then you called me through this back again.  You know what, nipple guy?  I'm about ready to go into the parking lot over here.  Yeah.  You're going to squirt milk the rest of your life because of your mouth.  Take care and brush your hair.  Take care and brush your hair.  See you later, doc.  All right.  Yeah, he's about to get shook.  Hey, nipple guy, when are you coming in?  What?  When are you coming in?  Dude, I swear I'll be there in an hour.  Oh, God.  All right, come on.  What time is it now?  All right.  5.30. 
[01:55:30]  I'll be there in an hour.  I'm at exit 4 on 684.  I'll be there in an hour.  All right.  I smell contest.  Someone get some Ritz crackers.  Oh, God.  No.  Dude, you get someone to take care of this for me, and I'll squirt it on anything you want.  We'll squirt it on some Ritz crackers, and we'll see who's brave enough to freaking ask you, man.  You're going to give me the operation?  Ask man in the studio.  I can't promise that, but we'll try to help you out.  Oh, we'll definitely, we'll put the word out.  We'll put the word out.  Do I get a consolation prize?  Yeah, of course.  We'll get a t-shirt and a bumper sticker. 
[01:56:00]  All right.  Now, get your ass down here, nipple guy.  Put me on home.  I'll get there.  All right.  Hold on.  And you may be showing up before the end of the show, Ant.  Mm-hmm.  Wait, we put it on a Ritz cracker.  Do we have some fine concert tickets, Ben, today?  Yeah, we'll figure it out.  Ask man here.  We'll eat the Ritz cracker with the nip pus.  Oh, God, no.  Yeah.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I wasn't really paying attention when you brought in ass man.  Yeah.  So when you asked him how much he weighed and he said 5'10", initially I thought he was  talking about his height. 
[01:56:30]  But then when Anthony said 510 pounds, that's when it clicked.  510 pounds.  510 pounds.  That's just unhuman.  Ass man, would you actually eat a cracker with his nip juice on it?  I'll try anything once.  Can I make a suggestion, guys?  Yeah.  Wow.  Hey, ass man?  Yeah.  What's up?  Try a sit-up.  Try a sit-up.  He needs more than that.  It's beyond sit-up, dude.  Stack or two?  Stack or two.  I don't even think that the product is that strong.  No offense to the fine folks at stack or two, but 510 pounds. 
[01:57:00]  Forget it.  How old are you?  32.  You're going to get a lot larger.  Right around 30.  That's when the metabolism starts kicking in, too.  What, slows down?  Yeah.  He just started.  That happened a long time ago.  At his rate, it's going to go in reverse.  There's no more slowing down.  So, hey, Rick, why don't you have the digital camera?  When we get the girl with the hot asses, you're running for the camera in the office.  Well, because I thought this would be a great contest for Stinky to take the helm and take 
[01:57:30]  some shots so he can get used to doing it.  Come on, Rick.  Let's hear.  Put your arms up in the air now.  No, what I'm afraid to say is, all right, take your shirt off.  Give us the penthouse pose.  Swank pose?  Oh, you've got to do the bent-over Playboy, like, squeeze them together.  Oh, he's doing it.  Wow.  Well, where's Stinky, then?  Someone's got to get the digital camera.  I got the camera.  Yeah, because this shirt isn't going to be off for long, believe me.  Stinky, what's wrong?  Come here. 
[01:58:00]  You know.  You have to take pictures of all the hot chicks, and then a fat guy comes in, and I've got  to take a picture?  Rachel's laughing out there, aren't you?  Good try.  Have Rachel do it.  Rachel, you want to take pictures?  Yeah, let's have Rachel do it.  Rachel, yeah.  We've got the guys take pictures of the girls, and now we need the girl taking pictures of  the guy.  Rachel, what do you think of Fatty, man?  You like that, right?  You like that, right?  Oh, let's make believe.  Exactly my type.  Yeah.  My guy.  He's going to show me how to use it, and I'll just... 
[01:58:30]  Put it on widescreen.  Now, Rachel, I remember the last guy that came in here with man boobs.  You were feeling him up.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you're going to feel up Ass Man?  Why do they call you Ass Man?  Yeah.  Because everything's big on you, so I don't think it's that.  Well, I have a website, AssMan510.com.  I used to go to ECW, and the crowd used to cheer for me to moon them.  They are extreme.  Me and Bubba Ray Dudley used to go at it all the time. 
[01:59:00]  I mean, before he made it big.  Yeah, well, then after he made it big, he forgot about, well, I can't say the little  people.  Rachel, you want to check out a moon?  Yeah, why not?  You want a moon?  Fun girl.  Moon Rachel, and Rachel can describe what she just saw.  All right, get the camera to go.  Can we put the moon on the website?  Sure, no problem.  What a coincidence.  I think it has its own gravity, just like the moon, just a little bit.  I have a feeling if we asked him if we could beat him with a shovel, he'd say, sure.  What size waist are you? 
[01:59:30]  What size waist are you?  68.  Dude, man, you're sweating.  68 waist.  Yeah, I'm kind of moist right now, so.  You are sweating.  You were sweating just sitting down, though.  Well, yeah.  You know, a guy of my girth.  What's the Louie Anderson joke about him sweating or something?  I'm so fat.  If I didn't sweat, I'd explode.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Hey, Louie Anderson, once again, I'm turning tragedy into comedy.  You know, I got abused as a child, and my father used to hit me with whiskey bottles, 
[02:00:00]  and my mother was a big enabling twat.  So I just ended up fat, and I could have done something about it, you know, like lose weight.  But I just figured I'd turn that tragedy into the comedy that is Louie Anderson.  Now I host Family Feud.  Hey, Family Feud of Louie Anderson.  It's going to be fun.  Oh, and I am allegedly a flaming fag. 
[02:00:30]  Did I say that allegedly?  All right, question up on the board.  First question.  Top answers.  A hundred people surveyed.  What's your favorite thing to eat?  Favorite thing to eat?  Show me man junk!  Oh, wait, I'm supposed to ask you. 
[02:01:00]  What's your favorite type of food product?  Show me in the can!  Wow, that's how I like it, in the can.  Hey, ass man, I'm an ass man, too.  It ain't for mooning.  But I've turned tragedy into comedy, and then it seems to turn back into tragedy when I tell it.  You almost got kind of a Louie look to you. 
[02:01:30]  Anyone ever tell you that?  Do you look like me, Louie Anderson?  Yes, I have.  Yeah?  Gotten a compliment.  Yeah?  Did your father used to hit you with whiskey bottles?  Yes.  Yeah, you were abused?  I was abused on a little playground.  The children could be so cruel.  They used to call me fat.  I don't know why, because, oh, maybe because I was fat.  So we got the crunch! 
[02:02:00]  Show me pudding!  All right, well, ass man.  Show me bung!  We're going to say that in a second here.  510 pound ass man.  Whoa!  Look at those pants!  Hold the F.  Those are huge pants.  Dude, what size is your waist?  68.  Yeah?  Hmm, 68, huh?  I'm a little scared.  I would say more.  I'd say that's got to be bigger than 68.  Oh, like he's going to lie?  Well, they're really 73, but... 
[02:02:30]  Padding that number a little bit.  Well, it's really 80, but I knocked it down to 68.  That's men's annoying.  Okay, here we go.  Let's cut to the chase.  Oh.  Oh, no.  All right, hold on.  Oh, okay, okay.  Poor Rachel.  Poor Rachel.  All right, all right.  All right, hold on.  Put on your seatbelts.  All right.  Okay.  Here we go, folks.  Oh, no.  Oh, no. 
[02:03:00]  Far away.  Get closer.  Closer.  Oh, come on.  Closer.  Get in there.  Get in there.  Get in there, Rachel.  Oh, my God.  Isn't it, like, getting underneath him?  What just waft out, man?  Ben is completely disgusted.  No joke.  What waft out?  Uh-oh.  Ben, help me out.  Do you have cranky ass?  Do you get cranky ass?  How does he know, man?  You know what cranky ass is?  Yes, I know what cranky ass is.  I don't think... 
[02:03:30]  Swamp.  Swamp ass?  Something like that?  Well, I didn't pop out a nugget, so I don't really know why.  Did you shower?  You showered regularly?  You did, huh?  You could wash every area?  Yes.  It doesn't seem like your arm could reach.  Oh, I have ways of maneuvering myself.  How do you wash that?  Squeegee.  Do you have, like, a brush?  Well, I have an apparatus.  You do?  Because it doesn't look like your hand could reach back there to clean.  I reach back there.  Show me how you wash. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah, let's see.  I can't believe you get back there.  Because I'm kind of amazed myself.  I can't believe you get back there.  Yeah, let's see.  All right, see, you've got a washcloth in your hand or something.  Now, what do you do?  How do you get rid of cranky ass?  I turn around, take it back to your ass.  See, no, you can't get the undercarriage.  I'm looking.  Your hand doesn't...  It barely gets hammered down.  It's crack.  Well, I have to go use the apparatus for the taint area.  What is the apparatus?  What's an apparatus?  Like a scrub brush.  With a long handle?  A scrub brush.  You know, the thing you use to wash your toilet out with? 
[02:04:30]  Oh, like a toilet brush?  Yeah.  So you soak the toilet brush up.  Yeah.  And you get in there and you could wash it out.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, there you go.  I'm sold.  When do you get to the point that you need an apparatus to wash a part of your body?  Don't you say right then and there, hey, maybe I got to start doing something?  Well, actually, September 17, I'm going in for an operation like to have my stomach stifled.  Like fat guy from, like former fat guy? 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  From air sick?  Yes.  Because he lost a lot of weight.  Having the same thing done.  Really?  Maybe they ought to staple your mouth.  Well, no.  They make the stomach the size of what?  Like a shot glass?  Yeah.  A couple shot glasses.  And then they reroute the swollen intestine.  That is really...  Woof!  Eric thinks he knows the apparatus.  Yes, Eric?  Yeah, I'm about 350.  I know the apparatus that he's using.  It's called a car wash.  Oh, Jesus.  Nice.  Hey, why don't you guys, you know, get guys at 350 and do Special Olympics? 
[02:05:30]  Well, we can figure something out for Ass Man.  And we're continuing cripple bouts.  We'll get something going on.  After the apparatus.  Rachel, what did the butt look like?  He really didn't pull down his pants all the way.  I was hoping it was more of a crack.  It's not every day you have a girl wanting you to pull your pants down.  I don't know how to zoom in or anything on this camera.  You don't want to zoom in.  Oh, well.  Hey, people want to know, after you use the apparatus, do a bunch of Mexicans come out and 
[02:06:00]  dry you off and then you tip them?  Yeah, I pay them a buck a towel.  All right, let's pull them all the way down for Rachel up.  Here we go, Rachel.  Is it on?  Mm-hmm.  What you're going to do is bend over and walk this way.  Like this?  No, fool.  That's an ass up.  Oh, like this?  No, like this.  Okay.  You're so silly.  I love the way you're asking.  Oh, Jesus.  Rachel?  Oh, my God. 
[02:06:30]  Oh, my God.  God.  Did you get it, Rachel?  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  You got it?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  What did it look like?  I saw the side shot.  Can you go back and check them out?  Horrific.  The abyss.  I mean, it was different.  When I pulled the camera away, I didn't realize how close I actually was.  Yeah.  So I was like, oh, my God.  Keith?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I saw this guy in a movie.  Yeah?  What?  He was the gluttony guy in the movie.  Oh, my God.  Very good.  Later, boys.  All right. 
[02:07:00]  I was thinking more of the guy from Monty Python.  It's Waffithin.  He just needs to hit somebody and walk up the stairs.  All right.  Well, but that's not why the ass man came in.  He wants us to check out his man boobs, Anthony.  Yeah.  Do you get the shot?  Good God.  My God, man.  That's great.  That's.  Okay.  Horrific.  All right.  You're sweating like a pig, yo. 
[02:07:30]  You are.  Now he's doing the Louie thing.  Remember, Louie would get out on stage and wipe his forehead of the sweat.  Then I'll allegedly call up some young call boys.  And wipe them over my place.  All right.  Anthony, you ready to check out the man boobs for the man boob contest?  I guess so.  Take your shirt off.  Take your shirt off.  Oh, Rick.  Yeah.  God damn it.  That's hot.  Take your shirt off. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  Oh, red.  Whoa.  Yeah, you're all red, too.  Yeah, I was at the beach the other day.  I washed up on shore.  Ah, that old gag.  I had to be bringing back into the sea.  Wow.  You are huge.  That is so much flesh.  All right.  Hold on.  I see what's going on here.  Your boobs in front, not as big.  You have a third nipple, too.  What's that about?  What the F is that?  It's like those palps that you have all over your neck and stuff like that. 
[02:08:30]  That's a third nip, Rach.  Yeah, it looks like, wait, is that what we're looking at right here?  Yeah, touch it, Rach.  Yeah.  Why are you making her do that?  Why are you making her do that?  I don't, too.  You got, like, underarm boobs.  Yeah, like your boobs go all the way under your armpits and then turn around and continue  around to your shoulder blades.  Take a picture of that.  That's amazing. 
[02:09:00]  Can we take pictures of you?  That's amazing.  Go right ahead.  How about, Chai?  So, now, you don't think if you lost the weight that your boobs would go away?  Can I say something?  I don't want to.  I've already said some stupid things to piss you off, probably, but I got to go the distance.  You look like you have one of those sumo suits on.  You know when you go in the bar and you put on the sumo suit and then you bump into your  friend and stuff?  And they got the fake nips on them, too.  Right.  They got the painted-on nips.  It looks like your chest doesn't look real. 
[02:09:30]  It's real.  I mean, do you want me to bleed out of it?  I mean, to prove it's real?  No, that's okay.  That's okay.  Rick, take some pictures with the website.  You've got to get the back.  You've always been this big?  Yeah.  Like, when you were 12, you were big.  Well, not this weight, but I was always a heavy child.  And what is this attributed to?  You're going to blame mom and dad or what?  Glans, what?  I just couldn't stop eating.  I couldn't put the fuck down.  There he goes.  The eating thing.  Hey, where do you know where to put the deodorant? 
[02:10:00]  Oh, that's good.  Like, do you put it on the first one or the second one?  Both.  Like, there's your armpit.  There's your armpit.  And then the boob fat that's under the arm is another armpit.  I apply deodorant to both areas.  To both?  All right, lift your arms over your head.  You might not want this.  I'm warning you now.  You might not want this.  He just showed ass crack, and he's saying you might not want to see this.  Let's go, ass man.  Lift up those arms.  Okay, here we go. 
[02:10:30]  Oh, my God.  Dude.  What?  All right.  I warned you.  All right.  I warned you.  Wait.  All right.  I warned you.  All right.  I did warn you guys.  One more time.  Now I've got to take a real look.  Man, what the F?  Lift it up.  Dude, that's some kind of disease or something.  What's going on under there?  Is that like cancer?  Your skin is brown underneath your armpits, and there's like a lot of like nipples under there. 
[02:11:00]  There are polyps.  There are skin polyps that have to be removed.  I've already started the process.  They were all over my neck.  I had one on my eyebrow.  But what's with the discoloration on the whole area?  Lack of air, Rachel?  Is that what it is?  Quite possibly.  I mean, I don't know.  Friction?  A lot of friction.  Maybe that's it.  Give the guy a cry.  He's trying to do something about it before you, like, get stuck in your bed.  And then the teamster's got to, you know, carry you out of your house. 
[02:11:30]  When you get a teamster's local, it's got to come and remove the side of your house and get the forklifts and, you know, bring you to the hospital.  That's bad.  You don't want to get there.  But you're on that road.  Look at you.  You've got to lose that weight.  He is going to get a stomach, the stomach operation.  You want to wring that shirt out before you put it back on?  Well, we actually have to take more pictures of the boobs.  We have to take pictures.  All right.  Yeah, and the armpits.  Rick, you've got to get the back shot.  You've got to get the back shot.  Him's just standing.  All right.  They're taking pictures. 
[02:12:00]  We should take a break, Anthony.  Yeah.  Thank you, Ashman.  It's been a pleasure.  On the way, we've got to talk about the hurricanes.  Is that true?  Ashman ate a gallon of soup in 45 minutes on Ron and Fez?  Yes, I did.  Yeah, you're on Ron and Fez a lot.  Those guys are cool.  Yeah, you know, I'm a big fan of the whole station as a whole.  As a whole.  And it is quite a whole.  All right.  Hey, when was the last time you saw your junk?  Oh, yeah. 
[02:12:30]  Well, I guess you could see it through a mirror or something.  Yeah, I mean...  In real life?  A while back.  A while back.  Wait, there's a girl from Cleveland that is, like, very bewildered, it says.  Danielle.  Hi.  Hi.  Um, I don't understand.  Isn't he, like, embarrassed?  Well, he's trying to do something.  I mean, we're joking, obviously, but he's going to do something about it.  He's going to get his stomach stapled, and that's just...  Oh, my God.  It looks like a woman's boob from the side.  Oh, yeah? 
[02:13:00]  A little bit.  Ashman.  She has a question for you.  Okay, go ahead.  He didn't hear you, Danielle.  He was taking pics.  Danielle.  She hung up.  All right.  I'm dead sexy.  Sexy man.  Sexy man.  All right.  All right.  Well, there we go.  Just, I did kind of hear...  I'm not embarrassed.  I mean, I am what I am.  I mean, I'm not going to deny the fact that I obviously have a weight problem. 
[02:13:30]  I mean, it's not going to stop me from living and all.  I mean...  Well, it might if you don't do something about it.  Well, I am going to do something about it.  But, you know, I go to work every day.  I put in my eight hours every day.  Every day.  And that's lunch.  And then what?  Oh, no.  Yeah, oh, no.  All right.  Yeah, but there's a point where I just had to say, you know, I got to do something about it.  And then, you know, I've gone out of my way.  For the past year, I've gone to doctors. 
[02:14:00]  I've gotten tests to prepare myself for the operation.  And, you know, I'm doing something about it.  All right.  Well, God bless you.  Godspeed.  And I hope it works out for you.  Wow.  He's sweating.  Because, yeah.  Wow.  Wow.  All right, Sexy man.  Thank you.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  866-277-4WOW.  Well, you guys are both stupid.

[02:16:00]  Scott, what's going on?  Hey, yo.  Hey.  What's up, man?  Talking to you.  Let's go.  Hey, yo, man.  Let me tell you, I got to share this with you, bro.  Yeah.  I was eating a sandwich when you were talking about the stuff shooting out this man's desk,  yo.  Yeah.  I threw up, man.  Well, that's it.  I threw up the sandwich.  Why I threw up?  I had just put mayonnaise on the sandwich, man.  Ugh.  And you talking about this yellow stuff shooting out of this guy's, oh, man.  Well, this guy.  That's got to be the worst, man. 
[02:16:30]  Well, what's up with that?  We don't believe the guy.  He's coming here before the end of the show to prove that he can squirt things from his  boobie.  Yeah.  And we think it's some kind of nip puffs, and we're going to put it on.  But let me tell you.  We're going to put it on a Ritz cracker, and the 510-pound ass man is going to eat it.  On top of that, I used to, man, mess with this chick, man.  She was kind of heavy, though.  Why I used to mess with her?  She used to let me do it in the bathroom at her job, right?  But she had the same thing, man. 
[02:17:00]  Her stuff used to leak out.  She had never had a baby.  It was disgusting, man.  Leak.  She used to leak the discharge.  All right, man.  We'll see if this guy's legit.  He's coming down.  Yeah, man.  Have a good one, y'all.  Thanks, Scott.  Kathy, what's going on?  What's going on?  I wanted to know, on the ass man, you say he's got a big ass?  Have you seen his junk?  Is it well endowed or what?  We didn't see that.  We didn't see his junk.  Well, you know, you could be fat and heavy and extreme and still be cute. 
[02:17:30]  So, you know, the face is okay.  You know, hell with the body.  You like the fat guys?  Yeah, he's all right.  How fat are you, Kathy?  I weigh 130.  And you like the fat guys?  Yeah.  This guy's 510 pounds.  Yeah, but that means nothing.  I'll do all the work.  How many fat guys have you been with there, Kathy?  Excuse me?  What's the biggest fat guy you've been with?  250.  250.  250.  250.  This guy's twice that, Kathy.  Yeah, but still.  Turn down your radio.  If he's well endowed, then he's well to go. 
[02:18:00]  Turn down your radio, and we'll get the ass man back in here for a second.  Turn down your radio, though, because that's a long delay, and it's going to just screw you up.  Okay.  Where's the ass man?  You can hear us in the background here.  There he is.  Ass man, this chick, she doesn't mind fat guys.  She wants to know if you're well endowed.  Well, I do have operating, you know, junk.  But are you well endowed?  Well, I get the job done. 
[02:18:30]  That's not answering my question now.  Uh, yes.  You can get the work done, and I have nothing.  Can you see it, even when it's ready for action?  Yes.  It stands at attention.  Oh, my God.  Well, I guess then, if it's bigger than his belly, then he's got something there, huh?  Bigger than his belly?  All right.  If you can see it.  Well, what do you want to do with ass man, Kathy?  I'm just wondering, because, you know, you can be heavy and still be cute.  Well endowed, you know.  Do you want ass man to throw you a bang in Kathy? 
[02:19:00]  No.  No?  No.  He takes the top, though.  Oh, really?  I don't think so.  You end up like those cartoon characters who've been run over by the steamroller.  I tell you what, there is a way she can justify her visual aid if she needs one.  What's that?  I have a website.  Okay.  Yeah, that's what I've been looking at.  It's assman510.com.  Okay.  And what, you got pictures?  Of you naked?  No, no, not naked, but you get at least somewhat of a visual aid. 
[02:19:30]  I think we got the visual, 510 pounds.  You could win a date with you?  Yes.  On your website?  It says, here's the deal.  This is your chance, ladies, to go out on a dream date with Big Dan the Ass Man.  Date includes, winner will be entitled to a chaperone night of dining pleasure.  Buffet.  First, you'll be whisked away to one of Ass Man's favorite Brooklyn restaurants.  Then enjoy a few cocktails, and the beginning of the word cocktail is highlighted. 
[02:20:00]  Before, she is treated to a romantic candlelit dinner.  Then, depending on the progression of things, dessert is optional.  Interesting.  And then he's got his email address, and you could win a dream date with the Ass Man.  Dream date.  Nightmare date.  Ass Man.  Come on.  Kathy.  Yes.  You want to come down and check out Ass Man?  I'll check out Ass Man.  You want to check out his junk?  As long as it doesn't scare me, I'll check it out. 
[02:20:30]  Well, it might scare you.  You think Rachel will check it out?  Hell no.  Someone's got to ask her.  Oh, man.  No, she's done.  I picked them up on the website.  You don't want our hot intern checking out your junk.  She's seen enough.  Are you insane?  Well, I thought you'd try anything once.  Joe says he could draw a picture of Ass Man for Kathy.  He's going to draw a circle.  Rach.  Well, this girl on the line, Kathy's kind of interested in Ass Man, but wants to know  if he's well in town. 
[02:21:00]  So we think you're...  You guys...  No, you don't have to touch anything.  None of that.  You just got to take a look for everybody.  You got to be the eyes of all the women out there.  Like, you will be at least 10 feet away.  Hey, man, if we have to see Big Butt Mendy naked and be the eyes for everyone out there,  you could do this for us.  Thank you, guys.  It's the same exact day.  What an adventure.  Okay.  You'll do it?  Why not?  All right, Kathy, probably by the reaction, you'll know what this guy's packing, okay? 
[02:21:30]  Okay.  All right, so where do you want Ass Man to be?  Right there?  Are you going to work it, Ass Man?  No, no, no, no.  No, no, no.  You know what?  You know what?  I'm going to nip this in the bud.  No, no.  Rachel.  No, no, no.  Ass Man, there's no cameras.  There's no cameras.  Listen, honey.  Ass Man.  If you feel comfortable, it doesn't bother me.  You want a few minutes to kind of, you know, get it going a little bit?  Yeah, work it.  We'll give you five minutes to get it going.  Work it.  You need to fluff.  You can work it.  If you want to wipe down there first. 
[02:22:00]  Go fluff.  Go fluff.  Come on, man.  Let Rachel.  Let Rachel see your job.  She's drunk.  Come on, Ass Man.  This is for a date.  I mean, this girl's interested.  Yeah.  You're about to prove to her that you're well-endowed.  Well, you know, that's not the only thing that's part of the package.  What is down there that you don't want Rachel to see?  That's the part of my package.  Kathy, shut up.  Okay.  As we're debating this and you maybe work yourself, I'd like to go over the top five 
[02:22:30]  chick list from Ass Man's website.  All right.  He says, coming in at number five, Angelina Jolie.  He says, forget Tomb Raider.  I want to be her womb raider.  And I won't be gone in 60 seconds.  Number four, Lita from WWF.  My inspiration for wearing a thong.  She can flip me any time.  Oh, yeah?  My inspiration for wearing a thong. 
[02:23:00]  This goes back to something I did for Rod and Fez.  I had to give someone the stink face.  Oh, I remember that.  Right.  The stink face.  Okay.  All right.  Number three, Chyna from WWF.  One of the only women I can get on top of.  Two, Anna Nicole Smith.  I like the boobie.  I like the boobie.  All right.  Sorry, Anna.  The only thing old about me is something I'm saving for you. 
[02:23:30]  And number one, wow, what a surprise this is.  Who would you imagine his number one choice would be?  Because it's way off the list.  Oh, boy.  I don't know.  Man, I couldn't even.  Movie star.  Yeah, she's been on TV.  TV.  Well, the obvious choice would be like a panel.  Yeah, but no.  Oh, Zena.  No.  No.  That's why I'm saying this is weird.  Helen Hunt.  Ew.  I just want to touch her hair and make sure she's not mad about anything. 
[02:24:00]  Touch her hair?  Why?  I don't know.  Well, she, there's something about the way she, her hairstyle, I don't know.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  All right.  Well, Rachel's waiting.  Ass man, Rachel's waiting.  You have to do this now.  Did you want to go, like, wipe down there first?  Sorry.  Oh.  I'm just being honest.  Hey, Ass man, that was another question.  You use an apparatus for washing your undercarriage.  You said you use the toilet bowl brush. 
[02:24:30]  Right.  But now, what, you know, when you, when you're doing a number two and you got to finish that  whole thing, how do you reach?  Like any normal human being.  Oh, you can reach, uh, like that?  Yeah, yeah, the, the, the back door.  All right.  That's as much detail as I want to get into that.  Our listeners wanted to know.  So, Ass man, let's go.  We understand that it's not worked up.  Kind of shy, I mean.  Ah, that's all right.  Just let her rip.  Let her rip.  Ah, no.  Hey, I won't tell anybody.  Let her rip. 
[02:25:00]  Ass man.  Ass man.  Ass man.  Ass man.  Ass man.  Ass man.  Ass man.  Ass man.  Ass man.  Ass man.  Ass man.  Ass man.  Guys, I must warn you again.  You might not want to go into this area.  Not well.  I gave you this warning before.  Rachel will let us know.  After those armpits, I think I can handle anything.  Right.  Rachel will let us know.  And Rook will be sitting right next to me, watching with me.  No, I'm not.  Absolutely.  All right, Rachel, lift up that mic. 
[02:25:30]  So we get your nice reaction live on the air.  Ass man, are you ready?  This is for Kathy, who's still on the line.  She's interested in maybe dating you.  She's still on the line?  Yeah, 510 pounds.  She hasn't given up yet.  All right?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, yeah.  Come on, ass man.  All right.  All right.  Do we really have to go down this road?  Please, guys, I'm asking you.  I don't want to go down this road.  Come on.  Drop your hands. 
[02:26:00]  There's no cameras, I swear.  We wouldn't do that here.  Just go.  No cameras.  Get out of here, Rick.  I will look away.  I will avert my eyes.  You have to watch with me, Rick.  You have to watch with me.  Rick, you have to watch with me.  Rick, you have to watch with me.  Ben is utterly disgusted.  Let's go.  And Rachel, you've got a very beautiful girl now wanting to see your junk, and you're beating  around the bush.  I'm talking to Kathy, man.  I'm talking to Kathy.  I'm talking to Kathy.  That's right.  You're helping out.  Come on, Kathy.  All right, here we go.  Power to the women.  Here is...  All right.  Thank you.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  No, you've got to, like, move away. 
[02:26:30]  Move away.  Let her see.  Stomach just fell.  Don't do it.  Don't do it all shy-like.  Just show her.  Whatever you've got to do.  One, two, three.  Just let her see.  Give a quick three count.  We will give you another plug for your website.  How's that?  Just quickly.  All right, here we go.  The pants are down.  Now, she's just got to put the shirt on.  Now, let her...  Make sure she sees everything.  Lift the belly.  Lift the belly.  Lift the belly.  Lift the belly.  Lift the belly.  Here we go.  I have anything right now.  I still don't see.  I've got to do that.  He lifted the belly, and you didn't see anything? 
[02:27:00]  Nothing.  I didn't see anything.  He lifted the belly three feet up in the air.  Come on.  Come on.  What's the matter, Ass-Man?  What happened there?  Come on.  One more time.  It's down somewhere.  All right, Rachel, get on the floor.  You need a better angle.  Yeah, get down.  Yeah, Rachel, get down on the floor.  No, but the thing is, is that the elastic is holding it down.  Oh, you aren't showing.  But, Ass-Man, you've got to go the distance here.  Come on, Ass-Man. 
[02:27:30]  You want to be on our show.  It'll be over in a second.  You want to be on our show.  This is it.  I know.  All right, get on the floor.  Rachel, get on the floor.  I am on the floor.  Get on your knees, Rachel.  Rachel, on her knees, right in front of Ass-Man.  Pull those way down.  Pull that up now.  Let her see.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  Look at her face.  What, Ben?  I designed it.  Rachel.  Oh, my God.  Rachel.  I'm confused.  Rachel, now, if we are all blind men, you have to now do your best to paint a picture. 
[02:28:00]  What did you just say?  Honestly, the first thing that came to my mind was, I thought it was, like, that's not...  What did you say?  Well, it just looked like flaps of skin.  I mean, I could probably draw for you.  It looked kind of like a...  Okay, draw it.  I mean, no offense, but it kind of reminded me of, like, women's junk.  Oh, no!  Like, just with the flaps of skin hanging...  All right, now... 
[02:28:30]  Wait, wait, wait.  I think I can paint the picture perfectly.  Okay.  You guys had a...  Yes, yes.  A huge deflated balloon.  Remember you guys had a description of the train coming out of the tunnel?  Oh, when we were doing man junk tricks or whatever.  Right.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's put it this way.  I don't have to pull any skin back to get the train in the tunnel.  The train is in the tunnel.  It's perpetually...  Oh, my God.  No, no, no, no, no.  It's not perpetually, but in a flaccid state. 
[02:29:00]  It's embedded in your own flesh.  Right.  Right.  He has his own little...  Oh, my dear God.  So, basically...  Draw a picture, Rachel.  So, basically, if this was Groundhog's Day, your junk would not see its shadow.  It's going to be...  Well, let's put it this way.  I would have to get excited for the groundhog to get out.  Oh, my God.  I thought Rachel was beautiful.  That doesn't get her excited?  You know when you see the turkey has that thing hanging from their chin?  Yeah.  Just a lot bigger.  Yeah. 
[02:29:30]  Draw us a picture, Rachel.  All right, Rachel.  Draw the picture.  Okay.  Draw the picture, and we'll put the drawing up on the website.  Do you draw good?  You got button junk, Bobby wants to say.  Honestly, I really...  Button junk, Ann.  Button junk?  That's what they call that?  Oh, my God.  Look at the picture she's drawing.  What the hell is that?  Rick also feverishly drawing with a Sharpie what he saw.  What is Rick drawing?  Those were flaps now you're drawing?  Those are...  That's... 
[02:30:00]  Oh, Rick sees...  Now, that's a bunch of flaps.  Yes.  You know what that looks like, what Rick's drawing?  A speed bag.  No, it actually looks like...  It's two.  It's not...  He's...  This shouldn't be here.  Oh, my God.  All right, Rick.  Whoa.  What the hell?  Yeah, see?  That's what you saw?  Yes.  How do you...  How do you even...  No, I can't see anymore.  But, see, I bet, like, if you pull...  How do you describe that, Ann?  ...flaps the side, then you could see what was really there, you know?  You have to pull...  Pull it aside.  No, this... 
[02:30:30]  You hope you have to thread them, which you didn't do.  Remember the junk...  Hold on.  Ann's going to describe it now.  No, I'm just...  Cut the drawing.  She's amazing.  I'm just the picture that Rick just drew.  It looks like what...  What's his name?  Was drawing in Close Encounters trying to describe...  ...the Devil's Tower.  I know this.  This means something.  You know what it looks like?  It looks like the Devil's Tower.  Yeah, upside down.  With all the wrinkles, it looks like an old lady's boob.  Yeah.  And his actual... 
[02:31:00]  That's good.  Unit.  So all you...  Looks like a nip.  All you saw was yam bag.  It was like...  Like really big bat wings.  You know when we did that stupid junk trick thing?  Yeah.  People say they'd flap them out?  Yeah.  Well, he'd have to...  He could...  He's got a waistband.  So pull...  But is that yam bag or just leg fat?  That's just...  No, that's yam bag, I think.  I don't think that's leg fat.  A combination yam bag, leg fat.  Leg fat makes a flap, and the flaps completely cover what's supposed to be there. 
[02:31:30]  Right.  Right.  Because it's pulled itself in.  The reaction on Rachel's face was classic.  Yeah.  It was total and utter confusion.  I'm like, on the floor?  Yeah, and you didn't...  You did not identify what was there.  Well...  You couldn't relate to it.  I just...  I couldn't...  It's just not right.  It's just not right.  Right.  Right.  I'm sorry, honey.  It's just not right.  No, no, no.  I understand.  I guess there's no date.  I guess there's no date.  Oh, well.  Kathy says no date.  You're lost.  Unless you want to check it out for yourself someday, Kathy. 
[02:32:00]  Unless you want to pull back the flaps.  Oh!  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Pull the flaps!  I mean...  Pull the flaps!  I was really hoping to see something a little more than that.  I mean, there was, like, a curtain.  Could you poke a turtle head out?  Get in my pants, baby!  No.  Now, is there any way possible...  Like, how do you...  When we're talking number one, how do you navigate that to keep from...  Like, how does it...  Do you have to...  Do you do a trick where all of a sudden it comes out and you say hi to it?  There...  There...  Is there a thing you do to get it to the point where you can do that number one? 
[02:32:30]  Let's put it this way.  I...  I would...  I constantly have to, uh...  How should...  Sit down to urinate.  So do I.  Oh, but you're a girl.  So, wait.  You sit down.  Right.  And then, when you just start, no matter where, uh, said unit is...  No, no, no, no, no.  I actually...  I kind of pull the yam bags to a point where the...  I know that there's a clear shot of it going into the toilet.  Oh, my God! 
[02:33:00]  Is this trip really necessary?  Wow!  Hey, man.  Yes, it is.  I know, I know.  I asked for it.  You know what?  We did learn, um, that when Ass Man says you don't want to go there, you don't.  No.  You don't.  I gave you a warning.  But it was worth a little adventure.  And you're a champ.  Holy smoke.  So now you sit.  Right.  You grab.  You pull down.  No, no, no.  I...  I...  Before I sit, I grab and pull.  Grab, pull, sit.  No, no, no.  I grab... 
[02:33:30]  No, no.  Grab, okay.  Grab, pull, release, then sit.  Release?  What is it, like a ripcord?  I have to maneuver the, uh...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The flapage and the thingage and everythingage.  I think he should show Rachel how he does it.  Oh, no.  She's been through it now.  No, no, no.  When it happens.  Rick, please.  All right.  Well, thank you, Ass Man.  That was wonderful.  Ass Man.  Yeah.  Fabulous.  And please don't go anywhere for when Mr. Nippy Guy gets here.  Yeah, the nip, uh, puss guy's coming.  No problem. 
[02:34:00]  I just have a quick question, because he's saying he pulls and he, uh, you pull it, right?  Rick, we don't understand either, but we know when to punch out.  Okay, um...  What do you do with, like, where do you put it?  I...  Do you sit on it?  No, no, because the yam bags get, uh, entangled into the, uh, the flap area.  So I have to move the, uh...  Holy mother of God.  All right.  That's a complication.  More information than I...  Kathy, no date with the 510-pound Ass Man, huh?  I don't think so.  All right. 
[02:34:30]  There you go, Kathy.  Sorry about that.  It was a pleasure.  All right.  There she goes.  All right.  All right.  So where were we?  Well, um...  Drop on, man.  We do have to take a quick break, but James Hetfield, of course, in rehab.  Rehab.  Metallica's lead singer.  I would have to drink like a fish to deal with that little troll, Lars, too.  Wrecked Metallica.  Lars wrecked Metallica.  Metallica's statement to the fans, to our friends.  We would like you all to know that James Hetfield has entered a rehabilitation facility to undergo treatment for alcoholism and other addictions. 
[02:35:00]  James has entered an undisclosed facility, and he will continue to receive treatment until further notice.  Until then, we have postponed all current activities, including recording sessions for our new album, as well as the July 29th launch party for Metallica.com.  It's because of Napster, man.  We have always thought of you as family and wanted you to know before this information gets out through our sources.  James is working hard toward recovery, and needless to say, he has our full support.  We trust that you will appreciate the sensitive nature of this matter and respect our wishes to give James the time and privacy he needs to deal with his problems. 
[02:35:30]  Until then, thank you in advance for keeping James in your thoughts and prayers, and we look forward to continuing to share music with you in the future.  What do you guys think?  Rick just added some words to the drawing, and now I understand.  Oh, I understood that part the whole time.  You didn't understand that?  Get, scan that, get it on the website immediately.  Yeah, that's a good idea.  People have to understand.  Yeah, Rick wrote the P word for man junk. 
[02:36:00]  It says that somewhere in there.  Somewhere in there.  Narrow.  Put that, get that scanned in, put it on the website so people can, uh, I don't know.  So people can.  Uh, Mike from Hoboken.  When your yam bag gets entangled anywhere, that cannot be good.  No.  Opie.  I'm the dick.  Anthony.  I'm an ass.  No one to turn here.  This is the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:36:30]  Why are you wasting your time with this sleazy trash?  People are starting to say funniest radio ever, so don't wreck you.  Ah, Sobe.  Sobe.  In this heat, you need something to energize your body, sharpen your mind, and uplift your spirit.  Oh, thank God.  There's only one product that can make that happen.  It's Sobe.  Check out the Sobe Lizard line.  Lizard fuel, a strawberry banana flavored brew, helps combat fatigue, uses ginseng to increase stamina.  Hey, and do they have the ass man flavor?  Stop it.  They get some funky flavors that are very tasty. 
[02:37:00]  I'm just wondering if they could spin an ass man flavor.  Lizbiz, a tropical flavored brew that zaps you with essential vitamins.  Lizard lightning orange mango brew, increases stamina, helps promote muscle growth, and restores energy.  And you get the basics with Sobe, echinacea zinc, vitamin C with the Lizard line.  3C elixirs injected with calcium, chromium, picolinate, and keratin.  That's right.  All three flavors, orange carrot, cranberry grapefruit, and strawberry carrot have this.  When the heat really gets you, try Sobe 3G teas. 
[02:37:30]  Sobe beverages.  Try green tea with echinacea black tea or oolong tea with bee pollen.  Sobe beverages.  This summer, you need Sobe.  O.P.  And for me.  1-0-2-7.  B.E.M.E.W.  We're back with the O&A show.  Let's go right to Jose.  Jose.  How are you doing?  All right, Jose.  I saw that thing with Spaz.  You know, the episode when he says to throw sand on the air and to get rid of hurricanes. 
[02:38:00]  And I started laughing because now he's going to think that they could do the other one.  The one that they want to clone oil.  Yeah, let us explain, Jose, all right?  Mm-hmm.  All right, thank you.  Okay.  I'm just glad the children were here to listen to him say it in his Old West gibberish.  What did he say?  We'll explain ourselves.  I think he was talking about a story that hit the news over the weekend.  Yeah.  Nipple guy, real fast. 
[02:38:30]  You're almost here?  68th and 2nd.  I'll be there in 15 minutes.  You'll be the grand finale if you get here in time, if you're for real.  Where do I park?  Ugh.  Yeah, that's a hell of a question, huh?  Hold on, all right?  All right.  Take care of nipple guy.  Go ahead, Anthony.  Yeah, over the weekend, there was a story that just stunned me.  If you remember, here in New York at least, when we used to have Spaz on, he was an intern,  and then he worked with us for a little while and then decided he did not want to be called Spaz anymore. 
[02:39:00]  Because he thought that was a character.  And he left.  He left the show.  Even though it was as real as it gets.  But he would come up with these answers and opinions and observations on science and things in the news.  Every Friday, we would have his little week in review thing.  And one week...  In bifacto.  In bifacto, yes.  It makes perfect sense.  Oh, Jesus. 
[02:39:30]  So one week...  Do you understand what I'm saying?  Not at all.  Those are clips of him.  One weekend...  Why not love gays?  One week in review, he was talking about a way to stop hurricanes.  I'm gay.  And tornadoes, right?  Well, his big thing was hurricanes.  Okay. 
[02:40:00]  Follow this logic.  Right.  Follow this logic.  Follow this logic.  I don't know.  Remember that one?  Go ahead.  Hurricanes had been just wreaking havoc.  Over the summer.  And Spaz was coming to the rescue and figuring out a way to stop hurricanes. 
[02:40:30]  He suggested dumping some absorbent material...  Like cat litter.  Like kitty litter.  Yeah.  From airplanes onto a hurricane...  In bifacto.  Which would, in bifacto, absorb the moisture out of the hurricane, thus then killing the  hurricane.  Oh!  Because without moisture...  Without moisture, yes. 
[02:41:00]  The hurricane would just die.  Right.  That's why it dies out when it gets over land.  No more moisture.  Correct.  So in bifacto, if you put kitty litter on it...  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  In bifacto.  Thus then, the hurricane...  The hurricane gate would be dead.  Right?  No!  Right?  Right.  Right.  So, I think we got the tape when he was doing his week in review and discussed the hurricane 
[02:41:30]  thing.  Opie, before you get confused, you said the way to stop tornadoes was with kitty litter.  No, that was the hurricane.  Tornadoes, he stopped with microwave ovens.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Remember when he said the way to stop tornadoes was...  When you hear there's going to be a tornado in your village or town, you would open up  the door, point the microwave oven at the tornado and turn it on.  Thus then, the microwave ovens would, in bifacto, send microwaves into the tornado and somehow 
[02:42:00]  stop them.  Correct.  So, don't be silly thinking that was for hurricanes.  Right.  Now, we ragged on him pretty bad.  Well, this guy...  Can you want me to play the tape of him discussing some of this stuff?  Yeah.  Yeah, definitely.  This guy was as legit as they come.  He truly believed this crap.  It is now time for the K-Dog Week in Review.  Science, I'm thinking inbreeding in your family. 
[02:42:30]  Follow this logic.  How to use a gardening cane, like a sugar-type cane, stupid, to turn into a gel to absorb the  moisture within a hurricane.  Are you retarded?  I just think there's a better way, a better way to kill hurricanes as well as maybe tornadoes  or typhoons.  What are you, high?  Now, what absorbs moisture?  Another thing that absorbs moisture is that salt that you put on snow.  It melts the snow, right?  Because it's hot.  It absorbs. 
[02:43:00]  Salt absorbs.  You are seriously mental.  Cat litter absorbs.  It's self-contained heat within a crystal.  This is stupid.  That's why it burns when you hold it, right?  I can't follow the logic on that at all.  Science.  Science.  I suggest that, like, when a hurricane is a-developing, is a-developing, is a-developing,  is a-developing.  I should just put a plane in the air and sprinkle the hurricane tornado clouds with these salt-type  substances, the cat litter stuff.  What?  And it'll absorb the moisture within the clouds and it'll turn into a bright, sunny day. 
[02:43:30]  Mental illness.  Treat it before it kills you.  So you pour the kitty litter and the other stuff over the oceans.  And absorb what?  The entire oceans on the planet?  No, but only when did dark clouds are coming.  Did you pour a bunch of cat litter on your head and it-  Yeah, it absorbed up your brain.  And it dried out your brain?  You're ignorant.  Hurricanes, more power than the entire world's nuclear arsenal.  But you were going to stop it with some kitty litter and salt.  Before it hits the ice, yes.  He touched his dick. 
[02:44:00]  Thank you for the education.  It makes perfect sense.  What are you, high?  He's either the best comedy writer of our time or he's this stupid.  All right.  We all had a good laugh, right?  Can I read a news story that happened this weekend?  Sure.  Anthony, go ahead.  West Palm Beach, Florida.  A powder touted as a potential way to weaken hurricanes sucked the moisture out of a thunderstorm Thursday on its latest tests. 
[02:44:30]  An airplane dropped $40,000 worth of dino gel granules into a cloud 10 miles offshore.  A television station's weather radar confirmed the cloud then lost moisture.  The people in the tower visually confirmed that there was a tall buildup and the next moment it was gone. 
[02:45:00]  The granules made by a company called Dinomat fell into the ocean as gel-like substance that dissolved in salt water.  The company hopes to sell the product to the federal government.  The product is dropped in a line from the outer portion of the hurricane to its eye.  The company contends that by dropping moisture out of the swirling mass, the storm is weakened.  The company said the granules absorbed 2,000 times its weight in water. 
[02:45:30]  It might be that this stuff would be great for making rain.  Why making rain?  I don't understand that.  But somebody from the Atmospheric Administration in Miami says they're skeptical the powder could reduce a hurricane strength by more than a few miles per hour and wind speed.  But they're working on this.  They have tested it.  And I got to say, I'm a dumbass. 
[02:46:00]  George, what's going on?  This is mighty ironic.  Can you believe it?  When I read it over the weekend, I swear I wanted to jump out of my balcony.  I want to jump off my balcony.  Unbelievable.  We got to try out some of his other suggestions.  No, we don't.  I was sitting there in front of the computer.  I punch up this story.  And all I said out loud, I swear out loud, I went, oh, my sweet God, he was right.  That's insane.  All right, later, bros. 
[02:46:30]  Thank you.  Hey, can we get another Spaz Science as we go to break?  Science?  They're too good.  James, what's going on?  Bro, can you say visionary?  Visionary.  Can you say, do you think that idiot would be right?  Yes, yes, yes.  Are you kidding me?  Absolutely right.  Yes, yes.  You got to get him back on the show.  Unbelievable.  Yes.  You got to have his follow-up.  Yeah, we might have to get his follow-up.  We'll see.  I want money for my bitch.  Oh, you guys rock.  James.  Yes, yes. 
[02:47:00]  Tonight, on the 11 o'clock news, your microwave-stopping tornadoes will tell you about it.  You want to hear Spaz talking about deflector shields?  The deflector shield one?  I can't even remember what this was about, but I remember it was ridiculous.  But now, who am I to say?  Who the hell am I to say?  This is Spaz talking about deflector shields.  Yes.  When we come back, we'll play What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show?  And I think Nip Puss Guy is going to squirt some stuff.  Super bees.  He's supposedly right around the corner, and Ass Man's going to eat it for the grand finale. 
[02:47:30]  It is now time for the K-Dog Weekend Review.  Science!  Science!  Science!  I'm thinking inbreeding in your family.  Follow this logic.  Uh, Con Ed is saying that the trouble is two years away that we're going to run out of power juice.  You've got to come up with a formula to create kinetic energy.  Wrong!  Try again, dumbass!  To get this kinetic energy, I think that we should make deflector shields. 
[02:48:00]  What?  Deflector shields to encompass the rays of the sun, to convert them into an energy...  What a tool!  Don Ed!  Send it through a cable into the power company of Con Ed.  You idiot!  Don Ed!  It should be black.  Black deflector shield because the color black absorbs heat better.  We know you do!  So we get a black deflector shield.  It absorbs the sun's rays.  Don Ed!  Science!  Science!  Get like a little, like a lightning rod in there. 
[02:48:30]  What a knob!  What an idiot!  Turn it into energy.  Somehow, I don't know because I'm not a scientist.  Oh, really?  Don Ed!  Transfer it by coaxial or fiber optic cable to...  What are you, high?  Don Ed!  ...to Con Ed places.  And I think that would work.  And we should have been doing this a long time ago.  You...  Come on!  Stop it!  Thank you for the education.  Get it!  It makes perfect sense.  What are you, high?  He's either the best comedy writer of our time...  ...1027. 
[02:49:00]  ...or he's this stupid.  Have you ever seen the people that listen to this show?  ...obie and Anthony.  Toothless, drunk, and white trash.  Ah, you got your own...  Ah, Hotwire.

Before I tell you what I learned, can I give you an idea of my new contest, you guys?  Yeah, go ahead.  It's real challenging.  The fans have to call in and come up with...  Tool.  Keep trying, tool.  Tool.  Tool. 
[02:51:00]  Jeff, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How are you doing today?  Doing all right, man.  All right, I learned I'm going to go get a stethoscope and crack a safe.  Yeah, it might work now.  Who knows?  Yes, guys.  All right, take it easy, guys.  I've got to go screw a tomato.  I'll see you later.  All right, Spaz also said, yeah, he could break into any safe with a stethoscope.  Yeah.  Didn't work.  Larry, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, crack?  I'm better.  Hey, man.  Hey, listen, I learned two things today.  Number one, whenever you're in an accident, screw the girl. 
[02:51:30]  Save your own ass.  Right.  Well, you've got to check your own ass first.  You've got to save it first.  Then you check it.  I didn't know what the hell was going on.  And number two...  Yeah.  I actually forgot what I learned, second thing.  All right, Larry.  Thank you.  Keith, what did you learn on the show today?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  I learned Asbury Park's great for bullets and black worms, but not for lesbians.  Right.  They don't like girls frolicking in little pools. 
[02:52:00]  Yo, can I say something?  I was over at that road show.  I don't know what the big deal is.  Only the people in the first row could see what was going on in that pool anyway.  I know.  Next time, we put the lesbian pool on the roof.  Right.  Good work.  All right.  Hey, hey.  Good work.  I just had a view of the hairy guy's neck, and it was sitting right in front of me.  All right.  Well, next time, it'll be on the roof.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Howard sucks.  Well, Jesus.  Just get us in trouble when you say that, buddy.  Yeah. 
[02:52:30]  Anthony learned wet lesbians never killed anybody.  Ronnie writes, I learned Opie should have used ass man as a human airbag.  Jersey Gary learned line of the day, Anthony.  Take care and brush your hair.  Take care and brush your hair.  From the doctor.  He also learned getting a tongue lashing in a lesbian pool is just like frolicking.  And when somebody says you don't want to go there, don't go there.  Opie, Dale Earnhardt's checking in. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah.  He said, hey, Opie, you got what you deserve for making fun of my mustache.  And Maya Menino said to go F yourself.  You got what you deserve.  Oh.  Ed, what did you learn on the show today?  Yo, today I learned that hell froze over because the bass was right.  Yeah.  Right on, man.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Thatch from Philadelphia.  Thatch.  Thatch from Philly.  Hey, man.  I learned that Rachel, the intern, wanted to get away from ass man's junk faster than 
[02:53:30]  Opie from a car accident in Asbury Park, New Jersey.  And it's really amazing that a fat man can use a toilet brush to clean his doompa.  Boss on.  Team beer.  Aaron, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  All right.  I learned something very important today.  Yeah.  Learned that ass man has meat curtains.  Oh, God.  Stop it.  Later, guys.  You know how pathetic this place is?  We're not going to start talking nice about this place just because we signed a new deal. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah.  We're not allowed to put the P word for man's junk on the station website for some reason.  Yeah.  They have decided that that's no good because we have a drawing of ass man's junk.  Well, we obviously couldn't put a picture up.  Oh, here it is.  Rick made a sketch of ass man's junk because Rick saw it.  And we couldn't put the P word.  It's up on the website, Anthony. 
[02:54:30]  Look.  Look at the drawing.  And it just says somewhere in there.  It's supposed to say blank somewhere in there.  And then there's an arrow where his thingy is.  Couldn't he put...  It just says somewhere in there.  Couldn't you put banana?  Anything.  You could say the P word.  Of course.  It's a drawing.  It's a website.  Guys are allowed to show you their junk on the radio.  You just can't describe it.  Oh, brother.  That's a dumb call.  That's a dumb call.  Stupid call. 
[02:55:00]  Stupid call.  Tom, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey.  I learned two things.  First, three rights make a left.  Yeah.  And second, if we can figure out how to symmetricize something, then the perfect crime might work.  Symmetricized.  That sucks.  Yes.  Yes, yes, yes.  There you guys.  Okay.  Eric learned some stuff.  Eric?  Yo, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Yo, I learned that Spaz is the head of research at Dynomat.  Dynomat.  Dynomat.  And I also learned that if you're 510 pounds and you got to pee, you first must grab, pull, 
[02:55:30]  release, and then you can sit.  Right.  There you go.  Nice.  Have a good day.  Okay.  Bye.  Mike, what did you learn?  Hey, Mikey.  Don?  Hello.  Hey.  What did you learn, man?  What's up?  I learned that according to Spaz, black both deflects and absorbs light.  I also learned that according to Rachel, the intern, Spaz people are both puzzling and 
[02:56:00]  disturbing and disgusting.  There was a lot of weird crap today.  Thanks, Mike.  All right, guys.  You're doing good.  Hey, thank you.  Joe, what did you learn, man?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I learned that Sandy and Weezer's wife were banging on the back window.  Yeah, stinky rules, guys.  Took out the wrong context.  Stinky rules.  Ron.  Hey, Ron.  Yo.  What did you learn?  How you doing, guys?  I learned that when a girl's giving a whirl in a car, it's called a whatcha-doosit.  A whatcha-doosit.  Sure.  Why not?  Hey, they all whatcha-doosit. 
[02:56:30]  All right, guys.  Thank you.  Later.  Okay.  Today, I learned on the Cocky and Friendly Show that a nose is not supposed to make that  sound.  Oh, you want to hear it again?  No.  Shh.  Shh.  Ow.  Oh.  You can't really hear it.  That's horrible.  That's disgusting.  Just stop.  Tony.  I learned Spaz was right the first time.  Why?  Why?  I said it right the first time.  All right. 
[02:57:00]  I guess we're just about done.  Well, the Man Boop contest has begun.  Guys, you've got to come down here anytime this week between 3 and 7 when we're broadcasting  to show us what you got.  Come on.  You could get rid of those things.  Yeah, we've got a doctor that'll suck it right out and make you look like a man.  Well, with instruments.  He does that.  Don't make it sound like he just...  Yeah, it's Dr. Gregory Pistone for fuller hair, a thinner body, and a fresher look.  Right.  Check him out.  Dr. Pistone.  He's in Philadelphia, Anthony.  Yeah.  www.drpistone.com.

Okay.  Remember that?  Yeah.  But that's what they said.  It looked like a really big, deflated balloon.  Yeah.  Rick said it looked like something else, but he was too scared to say it in front of Ashman.  Something about an elephant?  What did it look like?  It looked like...  Elephant.  It just looked like droopy elephant skin, like, you know, when they get old and it's just 
[02:58:00]  like...  Yeah.  ...hanging there?  Wow.  I don't want to say that.  Shh.  Right outside.  He can hear you.  What happened to Nick Puss Guy?  Not happening?  Yeah, it's too late now.  Too late?  Oh, well.  All right, we can get it.  That would have just put it over the top.  Disgusting.  Why isn't anyone answering the phones for what do we learn?  We're giving up?  We're busy.  Oh.  Well...  You said the show's over on the air, and we're still on the air.  Thanks, T.J. 
[02:58:30]  You said the show's over.  Well, I guess it's over.  I guess it's over.  Isn't it over when we're not here talking anymore?  That's funny, man.  You said the show's over as he stared at the on-air light behind your head.  Donnie learned rubbing out a batch in Asbury Park is called downloading evidence.  Yeah. 
[02:59:00]  I think...  All right, I think you're right now.  I think we're done.  Maybe now the show is over.  We're going to play one more spaz science bit.  Science.  Right, Rick?  Yeah.  Just tell people to come down tomorrow for more man boobs.  Yeah, I did.  I said if you've got the man boobs, come down between 3 and 7, and we'll take your pictures.  We'll put it on a website.  And then the listeners will vote for their favorite, Anthony.  Right.  Favorite.  Ass man's pictures are up as we speak.  This is the...  Oh, okay. 
[02:59:30]  This is the one you referred to, Anthony, when you were talking about spaz.  The getting rid of hurricanes using microwave.  Brilliant.  And who are we to say?  We'll leave you with this.  Hey, man.  Thank you very much.  We'll see you tomorrow.  It is now time for the K-Dog Week in Review.  Science.  Science.  Just tell me what you've learned about Earth.  Follow this logic.  Scientists plan to zap tornadoes with microwaves. 
[03:00:00]  All right.  Well, here we go.  Like, if you heat it, if you heat the water, it'll disappear, and it'll evaporate to gestures  storms.  That's a bunch of crap.  Guys, to dry out a tornado, should I set my microwave on popcorn, potato, or frozen  dirt?  Rush to cold air.  Now, if you send these high-end microwave beams to it, you turn that cold air into warm  air, and you're not going to get the tornado effect.  Don't be stupid.  I think that the microwave ovens could be used because it's all part.  What?  How do you fight the tornado with your own microwave oven at home? 
[03:00:30]  You've got to look at the bigger picture.  Mental illness.  Treat it before it kills you.  Science.  You man.  See, if you're emitting small microwave waves from one small microwave, and if everybody  around the tornado area that it's going to hit does this, it's extending emission of  microwave waves.  Because you can get radiation if you stand too close to a microwave where you're cooking  something and heating up something.  You're an asshole. 
[03:01:00]  So if that's the true effect for you, that means there's something emitting from these  microwave things.  So if you emit it towards the clouds, something could happen, and you're doing your part to  help.  What?  It's a giant horse's ass.  How would you actually focus all of these microwaves?  You would have one center of, like, rod that would collect all the emissions and the  shooter's...  Oh, stop!  I'm just picturing a bunch of people in their trailers.  You know, beep, beep, beep.  Come on, Ma, quick.  Get the microwave. 
[03:01:30]  Thank you for the education.  He's either the best comedy writer of our time, or he's this stupid.  Oh.  Keep the 14-year-old away from us.  Have a drink.  I want to bang you.  This is normal radio, right?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I don't know whether the city of Wisconsin, you guys, have to drive down there and bash  your heads in with a baseball bat.
