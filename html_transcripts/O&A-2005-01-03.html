<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with a song about "running with the devil," a countdown, and the liberal use of highly offensive language.  Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy Norton then discussed their upcoming trip to Las Vegas for a series of radio shows at CES.  They detailed their itinerary, expressing frustration with their less-than-ideal travel arrangements – initially a subpar hotel (Monte Carlo, later upgraded to MGM) and a van instead of limos – and the quirks of their coordinator, "Club Soda Kenny."  The conversation veered into tangents including a problematic bagel, Opie writing a check with the wrong year, and Anthony's upcoming plans involving "money being exchanged for sexual favors." A news story about seemingly apathetic tsunami survivors in Thailand was discussed, with the hosts expressing strong negative opinions about Russian tourists. Several original songs by Ben Sparks, featuring highly offensive and graphic lyrics, were played. Listener calls covered topics like the football playoffs, the Yankees, and the Browns, leading to further offensive banter about sports teams and players.  The segment concluded with several advertisement reads.

The show then shifted to their move to XM satellite radio and its implications, particularly their rivalry with Howard Stern.  Following XM and ski report commercials, they recounted their New Year's Eve celebrations and a humorous recurring story from a friend named Ben.  A major focus was Stern's on-air reaction to their move, with the hosts framing Stern's repeated mentions of their names as free advertising. They highlighted Stern’s anger over their takeover of some of his former radio slots, with listener calls confirming Opie and Anthony's presence in markets like Syracuse and potentially Harrisburg.  A story about an email from XM executive Dan Turner banning other shows from using their studio due to explicit content was shared. The segment included numerous listener calls expressing support and updates on Stern's on-air rants.  A Stephen Lynch song about killing kittens was played. The discussion continued with more listener calls, further analysis of Stern's reaction, and speculation on their strategic advantage in the ongoing radio "war," with Jim Norton again mentioned as a co-host.  Vulgar and offensive language was heavily used throughout.

A caller complimented the show and referenced a Howard Stern comment, leading to a discussion about their sleeping executive producer, Ben, who was on hold, and the hosts jokingly lamenting their listeners' inability to stay awake. Lunchbox called in, mentioning attending CES in Vegas, which included an adult film convention (AVN), and sharing a story about a tag-team encounter with Ron Jeremy.  They promoted their appearance in the February 2005 FHM Magazine (featuring Terry Hatcher) and their "Wow Sticker" giveaway, alongside more XM Radio advertising. A discussion followed about a dubious online story claiming a hippopotamus swallowed a circus dwarf in Thailand, with the hosts debating its veracity.  A caller, Matt from Jersey, called them out for using fake news stories, leading to a discussion of other questionable stories (a man using a bullet as a fuse, a gunshot causing pregnancy) and the use of Snopes.com for fact-checking.  Further calls, including one about a bat boy, led to more unbelievable story banter.  A significant portion detailed their disastrous Thanksgiving turkey-catching contest.  Hundreds of listeners, armed with makeshift weapons, arrived expecting live turkeys, only to find paper ones, resulting in an angry mob attacking their broadcast vehicle. They discussed the aftermath, including police involvement and a failed damage control attempt involving delivering pies to sick children. The segment ended with more discussion of Stern's reaction, promotional material, and off-color jokes.

The show continued with a humorous phone call to a hardware store where a caller repeatedly requested "butt plugs," while the employee thought he was asking for spark plugs.  This was followed by XM Radio commercials for products like the Delphi SkyFi 2 and Delphi XM MiFi, and a brief baseball game recap.  The hosts then discussed their show's flow and upcoming segments, mentioning a story about a Long Island "hooker hot dog stand."  Dean Edwards, a former SNL cast member, joined the show.  The conversation focused on Dean's SNL experiences, including his observations on the show's treatment of Black performers, interactions with cast members like Tracy Morgan and Chris Rock, and the challenges of transitioning from stand-up to sketch comedy. He described it as difficult due to internal politics and lack of support for stand-up comedians.  The conversation included tangents on Dean's impressions, Jimmy's farting habit, and the hosts' experiences with prostitutes in Rio de Janeiro, with graphic descriptions. Jimmy shared several outlandish (and sometimes untrue) stories.  Dean ended by promoting his upcoming stand-up performances at Caroline's.

The final segment started with a discussion about domain name squatting, one host mentioning having their name squatted and regaining it, and a car dealership squatting on "jim norton.com."  A brief, humorous Jay-Z impression followed. A sports report covered Pac-10 football bowl games, including the Sun Bowl, Holiday Bowl, and a preview of the Orange Bowl, detailing scores and highlights. The show concluded with XM Satellite Radio commercials, emphasizing various packages, the home tuner, portable options, and family plans, using rapid-fire repetition of the word "radio."

[00:08:00]  What the hell are you talking?  That's terrific, that's terrific. 
[00:08:30]  Okay, terrific.  Mom, please stop pulling me.  Well done.  I'm being honest, I don't know anything.  Mom! I'm not going over, I have to do this now. 
[00:09:00]  Get your cock out!  Please don't stop treating me like a whore.  Hello? Hello?  Okay, terrific.  Merry New Year!  Merry New Year!  Merry New Year!  Ha ha ha ha ha! 
[00:09:30]  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  The ONA virus spreading across America in the year 2005.  Oh wow, this 2005.  2005.  Oh, here's all the Regis clips.  Regis?  We got to start with that right away, I guess.  Mm-hmm.  You want to hear a really funny story, though?  Oh, funny.  Oh, Jimmy?  I forgot that New Year's Eve had happened and yesterday I went to write a check, but I put 
[00:10:00]  O4 on it.  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha!  Right, O5.  I hope they cash this.  Ha ha ha!  Hope they cash it.  All right, there.  A little bit?  All right, there.  There we go.  All right, there you go.  That's better.  All right.  Thank you.  I think we had like, what, five days off?  Yeah.  We might be a little rusty today, I'm thinking.  You think?  We always have an excuse.  I know.  Please.  Then we only have to do, what, two days of radio, and then we have a day off, and then  we do like half shows in Vegas, and then we're doing an extra show on a Saturday. 
[00:10:30]  It's just a mess this week, I guess.  What?  Show on a Saturday?  When?  I think we're doing a Saturday show now, too, yeah.  Yeah, I read something about that.  I don't know what it is.  Look at Jimmy, what?  Yeah.  Is it an actual show?  Are we a guest on a show?  I think we're-  Is it going to be our show?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, we don't guest.  Yeah, no, no.  We don't guest.  But what is it, and from where?  Pretty much from the XM booth at CES.  On Saturday?  Yeah, Saturday. 
[00:11:00]  So I think we're, okay, here's the deal.  Today and tomorrow, live, 6 to 10 a.m. in the morning.  Yeah.  Wednesday off, because everyone's asking about this.  Off.  Wednesday's a travel day.  Travel day for the team?  We now take travel days.  It's a travel day.  What is up with us in travel days?  Well, with our ungodly hours we keep, it would be a little rough to fly out there and do a show.  I think we're becoming divas.  The old days we would do a show-  Travel diva.  The old days we'd do a show, suck it up, and then travel.  But now, oh, we have to travel to Vegas. 
[00:11:30]  We can't possibly do a radio show.  So then, Wednesday's a travel day.  And then, Thursday, we're broadcasting live in Vegas, 10 a.m. to noon.  So, whatever that means on the East Coast, I don't know.  One to three here.  All right, thank you.  One to three.  One to three, they could hear us live.  Thursday and Friday.  And then, I believe, Saturday as well.  One to three East Coast time, you'll hear us.  And that's it.  Two hours, we're really giving them a lot.  I know.  Jesus. 
[00:12:00]  You know?  And we're getting lazy because XM calls us and they're like,  Hey, how do you guys feel about doing a couple two-hour shows from Vegas?  And I'm like, hey, that sounds great.  In the old days, we'd fight that, you know?  What the hell is that?  It's a bagel, but for some reason at this place, they don't have a toaster.  They put it like on the grill.  Oh, really?  Bagel diva.  Bagel diva.  It's on the grill instead of in a toaster and there's crap all over it.  Like, I'm seeing grease and there's something green on it, which could be a pepper or a 
[00:12:30]  booger.  It's awful.  And they're...  It's like grilled or something.  It's not your fault, sir.  I understand that.  That's just how they do it over there.  Throw it at him, Anthony.  No, I will not throw it at him.  Throw it at him.  I will throw it in the garbage.  Oh, nice shot.  Bagel.  Baked it off the wall.  I guess you're not eating this morning.  Well, I need a bagel that's toasted in a toaster.  From another place.  Remove bagel from pouch.  Stupid savages grill bagels.  What are they grilling it like on a grill? 
[00:13:00]  And there's crap all over the grill.  There's like...  I saw fat deposits on the bagel.  Just awful.  And a big piece of what I believe was a pepper.  Could have been a pepper.  Put it in a toaster.  It's not a falafel, you primates.  Toaster.  I don't understand technology.  And then when you use the toaster, get in a bathtub and drop it in with you.  Animal.  All right.  Well, so then we're just doing two, well, three two-hour shows from Vegas. 
[00:13:30]  That's it.  Three two-hour shows.  So we are doing that Saturday.  Yeah, just when we get going with the radio show, we'll be done.  Right.  I don't like the Saturday show.  Mine.  Because I have a schedule of things I'm going to do that revolve around money being exchanged  for sexual favors, and it does not include waking up early on Saturday.  Yeah, what time on Saturday?  10 a.m. to noon.  I don't like that.  Dude, we have to work six hours in Vegas.  That's it.  A total of six lousy hours.  I know, but can't we do three and three? 
[00:14:00]  I know.  It's all set.  We'll talk to you.  Has anyone found out how far our hotel is from the convention?  Well, now we're being moved.  What?  We're moved.  We're moved to...  You should really open up your email.  I do.  I didn't get shit.  I'll show you my emails.  Know why?  Because they got a weird email address for you.  I noticed that too.  I told them 8,000 times what my email address is.  These idiots can't get it straight.  They send it to some god-awful, I don't know, email address.  Dude, I've never even heard of that email address.  I know.  Kenny has that email address for some reason. 
[00:14:30]  Send it to my personal email address.  It's the only one I answer.  That's why you don't answer anyone back.  It's the only one I answer.  One day I did notice when something was cc'd to all of us.  I'm like, wow, that has nothing to do with Anthony.  But you know something?  If I hadn't told anyone, I'd be like, wow, I guess I should give them my email address.  Time and time again I've told them.  I maybe get one or two emails to my personal email address.  And then all of a sudden it goes to this cockamamie email address. 
[00:15:00]  Okay, you want to fill me in?  And let's share it with the listeners.  All the stuff I should have had in my email.  We have been moved to the MGM.  We have.  MGM, yes.  Look at Ben freaking out.  Ben.  Just say it on the air.  That's genius.  Oh, yeah.  Because we're just as big as Bono.  They're just going to be trying to figure out exactly where we are.  That's okay.  We've got to see Kenny's email.  You know how big the MGM is, you ass?  It's fine, dude, to be at the MGM.  Everybody go over it.  Yeah, yeah.  Fine, I'm at the Bellagio.  Ben's panicking that, you know.  Are you at the Bellagio?  Yeah. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, sure you are.  You're not at the Bellagio.  You're at the MGM.  Did you see Kenny's email?  Well, you didn't see it about fake names.  Yeah.  You all should stay under fake names.  Under fake names, right.  Try getting an escort up to your room, which he has to look at your ID and then you have  a fake name and you're like, oh no, I'm a comedian.  I had that one time when I toured.  Didn't work?  I won't do it because they thought I was a cop.  All right.  I refuse.  Wow, I didn't even think of that.  By the way, if you want to get emails to Anthony, it's ben.sparks at xmradio.com.  If you want to talk about travel arrangements, anything you want to talk about should go 
[00:16:00]  to Fat Mule.  A Fat Mule and hair that was combed with a rake and a hammer, ben.sparks at xmradio.com.  Oh my goodness.  You know, we're all over the place for this first break, but we got a couple brand new  Ben Sparks songs that came in.  I love them.  We brought them up.  We might as well.  Wow.  What was that hotel they were going to put us in?  The Monte Carlo.  The Monte Carlo.  Kenny was so pissed off. 
[00:16:30]  Club Soda Kenny said, I've never even heard of it.  You know what we're going to be staying with?  Farmers.  We're going to be with farmers.  Kenny goes, well, they're putting you in the Monte Carlo.  Is the Holiday Inn sold out?  Yeah.  He was livid.  How close is the MGM to the convention?  It's the convention center near Mendeley.  Mendeley.  That's near the Las Vegas.  It's very close then.  You could walk.  You could walk.  MGM is near, I think, the Venetian too.  It's not that far, right?  It's on the other side of the street is Mendeley. 
[00:17:00]  I mean, is it far from the Venetian where the port convention is?  Next to the Tangiers.  Oh, next to the Tangiers.  It'll be in the vicinity of everything.  It'll be fine.  But Club Soda Kenny has just been an animal with our travel to Vegas.  Absolutely.  Well, I'm happy now.  We're upgraded a little bit there.  Did we get sweets, Opie?  I was about to bring that up.  Oh, we didn't talk about our last meeting before we went on a little New Year's break.  Yeah.  Kevin goes, does this Club Soda Kenny understand that we can't afford seven, what kind of sweets? 
[00:17:30]  It wasn't even just regular sweets, like luxurious sweets, and we can't afford limos for everybody on crew.  Kenny's the man.  He knows how he wants us treated.  Kenny's setting up travel for us like it's Andrew Dice Clay in 1988, you know?  Yeah.  We understand we're attempting the biggest comeback in radio history.  We're not there yet. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  We're more like, give us a van.  One of those vans that take you to the airport, guys?  Yeah, we're up to the van stage right now.  That's what we are.  We understand that.  But in Kenny's eyes, we all should have our own limos and our own luxurious sweets in  Vegas, and every person should have a bodyguard.  It's not about you guys, though.  It's about Kenny, because he knows that if you guys are being picked up in a van, what  kind of an ass is he working for you?  Right.  The bigger you guys are, the happier he will be. 
[00:18:30]  The happier he is.  I'm very happy about the hotel thing, because I never heard of the Monte Carlo, and I like  casinos.  I like casinos being in my hotel, so I could just go down, play a few games of chance,  and then go back up.  And I was afraid that there might be a shitty casino down there.  So now it'll be a good one.  Now it's all good.  MGM is nice.  And Eric, you'll be staying, what, in that booth over there?  On a blow-up mattress?  Wow.  I'm staying at my apartment.  I thought you were going to be in D.C. 
[00:19:00]  No, they told me Monday.  Oh yeah, you're staying in New York now.  We've got to refund all the money that you laid out for the train.  You don't even get a trip to D.C.  You don't even get to go to D.C.  Nope.  Do you have to be here in New York?  Yep.  That's all right.  It's better than Vegas.  Who needs the hot weather?  You want to be here in Vegas with all those lights and fun and action happening.  You want to be here with the cubicles and the Broadway guys.  Absolutely.  Porn star.  Dude, those porn stars are so annoying after a bunch of hours just looking at them topless.  Ugh.  Lots of them have sex.  Ugh.  You're missing nothing.  Oh, man. 
[00:19:30]  You don't want to see that.  You don't want to be there.  Take down the bosoms off the wall in case there are any more bisexual interviews in this room.  Oh, you're going to have a lovely week.  Oh, yeah.  Have fun.  Hi.  Oh, Eric.  You must be Eric.  Did you see the Lion King?  Oh, too funny.  All right.  Well, we have the brand new Ben Sparks song.  Oh, I love this.  I think there's two here actually, right?  Oh, no.  Three?  Three.  Three.  All by Slim. 
[00:20:00]  Get ready to dump out if you're listening in Syracuse.  By Slim Shitty.  Oh, okay.  Here's the first one.  It's called Ben Sparks is Herky Jerky.  Herk.  Jerk.  Herk.  Jerk.  Herk.

Unless he's had some crazy instant sushi to eat.  Then here comes Gravy Leg.  Better move out the way.  He'll be going through a pound of toilet paper in a day.  And looking at his hair is gonna make you stop and think.  Did he wipe it on the floor after someone spilled a drink?  If you watch how he moves you'll be thinking.  He's smoking a crack.  Herky Jerky on the phone.  Smaller than a Tic Tac in studio.  He'll be yawning dirty all in his show.

[00:42:30]  and we're back  with the O.P. and Anthony  program  the O.A. virus  spreading across America  thank you  thank you very much  greatest show  in the world  greatest show  ever  the O.P. Anthony  show  because it was  made in Russia  shut up  why do they carry  Eli Manning  off the field  because he won  a game finally  the Giants  had one of the  worst years ever  and I'm looking  at ESPN  and they're  they're showing them  carry Eli Manning 
[00:43:00]  off the field  because he won  he finally won a game  against the Cowboys  yeah they stink  yeah  they're all happy  that they won  the Jets are happy  what are they jumping  around for  they're jumping around  like crazy  and then they  carry them off the field  I mean what was  the record of the  Giants this year  I think it was  5-10  something like that  6-10  6-10 maybe  yeah I think they  might have been  6-10 with that win  yesterday  way to blow  the excitement  of the Jets  Rams game too  there Buffalo  thanks  Jesus Christ 
[00:43:30]  what an anticlimactic  piece of crap  that was  watching the game  all psyched  it was a cool  close game  you know  well I went  and watched  football with Ben  yesterday  and we went  to a really cool  place where there  was like  you know  a huge screen  and then there  was two screens  on each side  of the huge screen  so there's basically  five football games  on  wow they ought to  go with that idea  at other places  never heard of that  but this one was  great because  it was right there  I mean a lot  of these other sports  bars you have to  look all around  the place to get  your game  but right there 
[00:44:00]  it was right  mission control  it was mission control  exactly  so they had the  Bills game on  which I was taking  a peek  then my Jets of  course was on  the big screen  and then Ben's  Pats game was on  which that just  didn't even matter  that game  no  it still matters to me  no I understand  how crazy I went  when they switched  the channel  yeah yeah  all of a sudden  the bartender's like  this game doesn't  matter  let's find a game  that matters  so he switches  off to Pats  Ben just jumps up  from the bar  he was doing that  anyway  and raises  bloody hell  and the guy  he puts  the game back on 
[00:44:30]  so I'm watching  the Bills Steelers  because that's  really important  you know  and the Bills lose  so that's it  now the Jets game  means nothing  meant nothing  I'm watching  the whole thing  and then they go  oh yeah  and Buffalo lost  so the Jets are in  and this game  really doesn't matter  right  oh thanks  right  I just invested  a couple of hours  watching the game  and it ends up  not mattering  and then the Jets  they're so stupid  it's like first and goal  and they go for  they try to get a touchdown  obviously for three downs  and then they kick  the field goal 
[00:45:00]  it's like what are you doing  the game doesn't matter  now you're going  into overtime  risking some of your guys  partially getting hurt  in overtime  because it just didn't  matter at that point  and Ben's like  where are you going  I'm like dude  it's overtime  this game doesn't matter  anymore  I'm out of here  I'm not going to watch  an overtime of a game  that doesn't matter  yeah they kicked  a field goal  tied it up  so you're right though  anti-climatic  yeah  what was it  anti-climatic  okay  was that bad  no no no  kind of bad  I just didn't realize  that there was no  climate at all  in that  anti-climatic  climatic 
[00:45:30]  could put a C in there  you just stopped our  C  you just stopped our  football talk  for a quick little  little joke  but it wasn't stopping  the football talk  I was trying to help you  we were kind of  flowing there  you'll flow again  but you won't  we were talking about  your stupid cowboys  while you were taking  the league  and Vinny Testaverde  he better retire  enough  enough with  Vinny Testaverde  how does he get  another gig  he's done  nah he's done  that's the end  and you watch  Parcells will step down  probably today  he doesn't want to  coach anymore 
[00:46:00]  especially that team  he wants to coach  winning teams  like he wants to  be with the Pats  again  too bad  we got a better coach  you do  he is a good coach  you guys got the best  coach in the league  I'll admit that  Parcells is just  stubborn and he's a baby  and he always leaves  before his contracts  are up  he really annoys me  that fatso  big apple body  so who are you  banking on there  I gotta go with my  it's weird with me  I was explaining  this to Ben  I was explaining  this to Ben  I mean 
[00:46:30]  well I mean  before  yeah I'm going  Jets all the way  obviously  but I like the Jets  I worked in  western New York  and went to school  for between work  and school  like 10 years  so I'm a Bills fan  as well  which is stupid  and then we were  up in  we were up  I know  and then we were  up in the Boston area  when the Pats  were doing their thing  so I take a peek  at the Pats too  all three in the  same freaking division  it's stupid  yeah  so I'll root  for the Jets  big time  and I hate to admit it  but if the Jets  get knocked out  then I'm  Pats all the way 
[00:47:00]  as a New Yorker  I just find it hard  I understand  to root for any  team  but everyone has  a secondary team  what's your  secondary team  yeah  don't really have one  I'll be going for the Jets  also  just a little  New York spirit  bye bye  they're gonna be out  first round  yeah they really  didn't look good  Pennington stinks  alright relax  Boston arrogance  I don't like the fact  that you're a Patriots fan  it really bothers me  relax  you guys got Randy Johnson  and the Yankees  I don't want Randy Johnson  he's 57  I don't want him  he's an enemy  Steinbrenner makes me 
[00:47:30]  nauseous too  I'm a Yankee fan  you know what  I hope he throws  his 6 foot 11 back out  on his way to spring training  I hope he's picking up  a teenage prostitute  and he hurts his back  in Tampa  as a Mets fan  I was very happy  to see you guys  signed another old  fucking  dude it just makes me sick  I like the young talent  I like to watch them develop  I'm willing to take  a bad average for a year  right there you go  instead of  you know  he'll probably do well  Randy will  this season  he'll wait to 14 games  but then you know  it'll be like a 14 gamer 
[00:48:00]  yeah  which is fine  but then what  but when it comes down  to the World Series  he's not gonna have anything  he's gonna be  you know those pitchers  get worn out  by the time  you know  the playoffs start  well Kevin Brown  was good this year  he was very effective  when we really needed him  in the playoffs  I hope he gets  fingernail cancer  in all ten of his hands  his fingers  all ten of his hands  whatever climactic  yeah  Johnny from Cleveland  what's up Johnny  oh dude  you guys want to talk  about pathetic man  I'm a Browns fan  what about them 
[00:48:30]  dumping the Gatorade  on the coach  after wearing the first  game since October  but the only thing  I can say about that  is the excuse  they actually thought  he was wearing  one of Steve's shirts  oh there you go  I had to put it out  did they really do that  yesterday  they dumped Gatorade  that's a Giants  ripoff by the way  what the Giants  started that  yeah way back  I think it was  on Parcells right  that was the first  time that was ever  done  I don't know  was that though  like 86 I think  that was the first  time they ever did that  first time I ever  saw it in the pros 
[00:49:00]  I thought they stole  that from porn though  because they won a game  and they threw it  in Parcells face  a money shot  a big cooler  a clam chotter  let's say hi to  John in Pittsburgh  what's going on man  hey yeah go ahead  John  come on man  you know the Steelers  are going to fuck  everybody up  thank you John  yeah I think it's  going to be tough  to beat the Steelers  this year  I really do  well Ben  very confident  whatever  we'll get all  guys back  we'll be great  we'll be great  we need to get  everybody back  from injuries  if we get  everyone back 
[00:49:30]  we'll be fine  stop  yeah  didn't have  Corey Dillon in  that game  Corey Dillon stinks  oh yeah he stinks  I know  he's so good  like Vinny Testaverde  he's not good  well we all know Vinny  I mean Ben  Pennington  you're abusing him  over Vinny  but he'll admit  Vinny stinks  dude I hope  I hope Vinny  falls on a flight  of steps  with an armful  of prosthetic limbs  I don't know  what that meant  I hope that's  Vinny's apartment  on fire there  on the news  East Flatbush  Brooklyn  a fire  an apartment  jeez what a surprise 
[00:50:00]  in the beautiful  Flatbush section  of Brooklyn  my god  by someone making  grilled cheese  with an iron  stupid criminals  I really bounced  back after that  stupid fall down  the steps joke  thank god  you came back  strong  real strong  you don't like it  up there Anthony  what  have you ever  been there  to know what  it's like  I know what  it's like  believe me  it's similar  to where  Charlton Heston  was riding a horse  and saw the  Statue of Liberty  very similar 
[00:50:30]  what an awful  place that is  I drove down  Flatbush Avenue  once and I  did not stop  for lights  and any cop  I've told this  story to  said good  don't  we don't  there are certain  parts of Brooklyn  the cops do  they lock their  doors  because there  are animals up  there  it appears  I was just  watching the news  there was a big  apartment fire  live  of course they show  it we love the news  in here in the morning 
[00:51:00]  because they just  show carnage  we saw our  morning wreck  of the day  that was a sick  apartment fire  there with those  I had no idea  that drinking and  driving was such  a problem in this  country until I  started getting up  this early  every morning  every morning  in this city  it has to be  Dewey accidents  it has to be  I know  every morning  these cars are  in half  they're you know  upside down  they're  something they  don't show  through the rest  of the day  either  because I guess  it's not happening  as much  because the drunks  are home 
[00:51:30]  sometimes you  can't even tell  it was a car  yeah  when you wake  up like a  regular person  you don't see  any of this  but the first  news story  every morning  when we walk  in at 5am  is the wreck  of the morning  they hose it  down and clear  the road  please I have  to get through  here  why you close  the road  for me  I have to  get to work  I'm bringing  the saltines  today  saltines and  tea right  coffee  saltines and  coffee 
[00:52:00]  this nastiest  strong  Russian coffee  with the ground  still in it  a real man's  cup of coffee  not the wimpy  pussy drinks  like you drink  in America  you girls  that drink  the Maxwell  house  it has to look  like you poured  it out of an oil  derrick  and drink it  down like a man  like a Russian  man  ick  coffee and saltines  must have given  you a bowel  movement 
[00:52:30]  that looked  like wicker  awful a snack  is that  oh hilarious  let's get  Eric in the  city  Eric what's  up  hey  Opie how do  you figure  Randy Johnson  is going to  win 14 games  he lost  he lost like  nine games  by one run  do you think  that's going to  happen in New  York  I was being  nice  I was being  real nice  because you know  they probably  grabbed him  thinking he's  going to get  another 20 win  season in him  and if he's  lucky he'll get  14  and Steinbrenner  is going to  do that  every year 
[00:53:00]  when another  guy comes along  in two years  an old guy  he's going to  get him too  but dude you know  the thing that  bothers me so much  about it is that  the Yankees  what makes this  Yankee team  what could have  been this dynasty  was when Steinbrenner  was at a baseball  Gene Michael  and in some part  Buck Showalter  built the team  but Gene Michael  kept them from  trading all these  young players  and I think  Bob Watson  did a great job  as GN  and Steinbrenner  comes back  and starts making  the same stupid  moves he made  in the 80s  and you're getting  the same results  when Showalter  was here  they did nothing  but lose 
[00:53:30]  the minute he  took off  they started winning  the same thing  happened in Arizona  dude you're not  disagreeing with me  what I'm saying is  he helped build  the team  I'm talking about  some of the young  talent developed  he was an over  managing ass  and I'm glad he left  Torrey is better  but he would  he would play  he would play  Randy Velarde  against Randy Johnson  all year  because he was a righty  and then Wade Boggs  would sit on the bench  and then face him  in the playoffs  for the first time  and strike out  because Randy Johnson  was throwing 98  Wade Boggs 
[00:54:00]  from the SX videos  Wade Boggs  yes  after Wade Boggs  had his testicles  tied up  poolside  he was an over  managing fool  and I was glad  he left Buck  Showalter  alright  thank you Eric  thank you  thanks for calling  the program  back in a mad dog  let's go to Jay  in Rhode Island  well it's a big  sports morning  it is  let's go Jay  hey how's it going  pretty good  I just want to say  I'm with Ben  on this whole  Boston arrogance  I'm enjoying  every second of it  it's fucking great  well enjoy it 
[00:54:30]  and I have a feeling  if we make it  to the AFC  championship game  we'll more than  likely be playing  Pittsburgh  and last time  we played Pittsburgh  we didn't really  have a running game  Corey Dillon  wasn't with us  and I have a feeling  that this time around  Corey Dillon  will help us  beat the  Pittsburgh Steelers  Ben's not a real  Ben's not a real  Patriots fan though  he just kind of  likes them  yeah alright  you know I'm not  a real Patriots  just show up  I know  and you know 
[00:55:00]  what's going to be  funny when the  Yankees lose  when you guys  lose with all  those players  he just goes  from sport to sport  that's okay  I love how  that's how they  do it up in Boston  they're extending  this whole Patriots  thing from the  Red Sox victory  in the World Series  they're extending it  like the Pats  have something to do  with the Sox too  so they alternate  between the two  like it's the same  entity  they're both  world champions  oh well  slow down  well we'll see  when the Yankees  lose this year  with all that 
[00:55:30]  talent  you guys have  all the money  you guys spent  I'll stand up  and applaud  I do not  I hate Randy Johnson  and I hated  Kevin Brown  but I said it  all year  I wasn't a big  Kevin Brown fan  I said he stinks  and I hope he dies  before he gets to  spring training  and he stunk  I'll take Nick Johnson  I'll take Nick Johnson  that Down Syndrome  face  high sock  idiot  with a high  on base percentage  I'll take that kid  over Jason Giambi  any day  I didn't want  that steroid douchebag  I don't want him now  boot him  boot him  he's going to go up there 
[00:56:00]  with AIDS arms  and go one for 50  nobody wants to see him  he's going to have flab  like my grandmother had  we were talking about that  we saw Mike Piazza on TV  I think it was  during last week's show  sitting next to Eddie Trunk  and all these guys  are already starting  to look a lot thinner  a lot thinner  well they're getting  they're really cracking down  on the steroids  in baseball  and it's obvious  who was taking them  and who is now  no longer taking them  because we were like  who is that  sitting 
[00:56:30]  no what  is that Piazza  we don't know  what he does  but he looked a lot thinner  a lot thinner  off season  maybe he's just not  working out  it's going to be hilarious  when they go back  to hitting only like  28 homers  a year again  yeah people are wondering  why so many people  had these great  home run records  60-70 homers a year  it's going right down  to 28 homers  a year again  Piazza looked like  he should be  swinging a shovel  I'm essential  to the baseball effort  hey Sheffield  had a good year though  is he on steroids  or no  Sheffield 
[00:57:00]  what is he  let him keep taking him  he was an animal  this year for the Yankees  good boy  good boy Gary  yeah you're really  going to see  you're really going to  see that taper off  I think  that's why Babe Ruth  was so amazing  you could say it  a million times  but not only was he  a world series record  holder as a pitcher  with Boston  but the guy came up  and hit 60 home runs  and other teams  were hitting  the guy home run  Hank used to hit  15 home runs  that was his nickname  home run Hank  home run Hank  yeah whatever  yeah that was  it was an awful nickname  you know back then  you know  he didn't hit 15  every year  silly  no no that was 
[00:57:30]  his nickname  for hitting 15 home runs  oh really  big deal  yeah  not Babe Ruth  was home run Hank  no I know I know  I know I know  and they were like  wow that's a lot  of homers  no I thought  you were talking  about Hank Aaron  I got a little  confused there  no no no  Hank Aaron  I got a picture with  no no I'm not  talking about Hank Aaron  you got a picture  with Hank Aaron  I did  he had a core dinner  where'd you get that  Congress of Racial Equality  the same year I got  what the hell  are you doing there  I know Roy Ennis  he was good friends  with Manny at the  Comedy Cellar  and he comes in  and his son Niger  and you know  I get invited  to the core dinner  so I go

[01:07:30]  would sit  maybe she had typhoid  it was so awful  embarrassed myself again  you are the worst  when you just walk  it's it's more important  to him  to get the picture  than it is  to keep from making  an ass of himself  oh yeah  so he will just walk up  to people  not not even sure  it's them  excuse me  picture please  i wouldn't care  i believe i saw  if i saw a celebrity  on a beach  picking up the washed up  remains of a loved one  i'd still say look  i know this is a bad time  look this way 
[01:08:00]  look this way real fast  oh  i realized  click  tsunami  tsunami  tsunami  there's no reason  for a t to be in that word  that's awful  um really fast  on the instant feedback  michael from cleveland  tell norton he means  frank home run baker  not home run hank  that's where i got confused  with the hank erne thing  oh all right  frank baker  what year was it  like 19  home run baker  i guess  and what he hit 15 homers  and that was his nickname  but yeah  and then babe comes along  and hits 57 and 60  i mean  with no  you know 
[01:08:30]  no day games at all  no night games  bastard  and did you do anything  for new year's or what  no  i hung out at home  i uh  i did what i used to do  i guess when i was a kid  just watch the tv shows  i watched the um  the little new year's  rockin eve  did you watch regis  it was awful  that's what i was doing  i was researching  watching regis  what an awful show  that is  that whole new year's  rockin eve concept  even with dick clark  you know  like the year  a couple of years ago 
[01:09:00]  when he was still doing it  before this year  and he had his little stroke  and they got regis  to stand in  but even before that  that whole concept  is just so dated  and so  like i guess in the 70s  it was kinda  it was actually hip  it was never cool bro  they'd have  no i think it was  at first  because it was like  rock bands  of the time  they'd have like  you know  three dog night  would come on  and perform  in the 70s  and then it just  from there  it got really bad 
[01:09:30]  and now it's just  who can relate to this  their big band  was earth wind and fire  at the end of the show  i was waiting for them  to ring in 1976  with ashley simpson  introing the band  ashley simpson  you can just see  the meetings  for these shows  where they figure  we gotta get  some of the  the names of the day  some of the big  popular stars  that are out there  how about ashley simpson  who is she  isn't she a big one  no  can we get that

[01:20:00]  morning i'm not calling  from syracuse but i was  listening to howard  uh-huh early earlier  and um someone called  up because you guys  are on in there and of  course you know he was  complaining about it and  that's where it started  the whole conversation for  like 20 minutes about you  guys perfect he just gave  us a 20 minute commercial  he's so effing stupid he  thinks all his stations  that he's on now once he  goes over to satellite  they're going to turn into  bodegas and movie theaters  no other people are taking  your place because uh that's 
[01:20:30]  what happens in the real  world while you're sitting  there trying to build your  audience back up because  that's what happens when  you make the move to  satellite you certainly  don't have the audience  that you did on broadcast  radio so while you're  sitting there other people  will be uh doing uh a show  on the stations you used  to be on it's not gonna be  a big deal howie i believe  we're gonna be adding a few  more stations in the very  near future and yes we do  believe it could be this  very program that you're 
[01:21:00]  talking about all morning  you jackass that's right  us idiots we'll be  replacing you you jerk off  because we were smart when  we made our deal that's  right we didn't sign an  exclusive deal yep we do  what we want we're allowed  to do both see that was the  way to go idiot that's it  what up what up what valerie  what a pompous self-centered  idiot and by the way we allow  people to talk about other 
[01:21:30]  shows on this program yes  valerie and the caller who  called up also mentioned  something about you guys on  in harrisburg i don't know  what that's about are we on  in harrisburg today i don't  know that's what the guy said  there was a rumor that that  was uh possibly happening and  a few other places as well i  don't know where we're at with  that we're just doing our  satellite radio show and uh  and these deals are being made  behind our back so thank you  valerie for the update so we're  on in syracuse very cool there  you go anthony it continues  hmm what's wrong it i'm just 
[01:22:00]  uh reading instant feedback  stern is off on two rhode  island stations  hmm all right well it begins  the guy thought he's gonna be  able to bad mouth everybody and  sit there and they're gonna sit  and take it because you're so  wonderful  you big ass because he's such a  wonderful guy the scumbag that  he is he's gonna sit there and  everyone's just gonna take it no  everyone's right gonna pull you  off uh they're gonna slowly or 
[01:22:30]  quickly pull you off the stations  chop your show apart so that by  the time you're ready to make the  jump to satellite your listeners  will be disgusted anyway because  your show is being butchered because  you're a pussy you're a pussy let's  rewind uh eight million times ago  that you said if this happens i'm  leaving radio if this happens uh you  won't hear me on monday how many  times this this phony hypocrite said  this if mel leaves i'm leaving and 
[01:23:00]  not leaving signing a contract for a  year later he's leaving he said he  would walk off the show if they keep  censoring my show i'm not doing it  i'll play music i'll do this i'll do  that  does it take a brain surgeon to figure  this out that he's just a phony and  he's a pussy to boot god damn stop it  howard is really tooling on you right  now  good keep talking advertise our names 
[01:23:30]  that's what that's what we want you  know what a commercial costs on his  show right thanks for the free one  you big dick supposedly he's been at it  for 20 minutes and uh he's mentioning  our names a lot it's it's perfect he  played into our hands and and you know  what  there's gonna be a lot of little  battles between us and him and uh  guess what we win this one trust me  big time we ruined his two-week  vacation and we took over a spot in  syracuse and possibly some other  markets in the very very near future  so so who who won and who lost this  thing  uh howard's trying to play it off as a 
[01:24:00]  joke like he's not being hurt yeah  that's how howard plays everything off  on the air he's a big pussy and then  behind the scenes he's losing his mind  and we love it behind the scenes when we  used to do stuff that would piss him  off he'd run to the boss crying to have  them shut us up take us off the air  fire us fire our boss so this is a  pleasure for us because we know that on  the air he could go yeah yeah they're  over there but it doesn't bother me and 
[01:24:30]  behind the scenes he's losing his mind  losing his mind and we love it who who  said that what farid is doing is illegal  what's illegal you sit there bad-mouthing  everyone and you expect them to just  sit there and lap at your ass  hmm  no they're gonna pull you off the air  they'll take your listener base that you  have now and make it less before you go 
[01:25:00]  to satellite and they'll chew your show  apart so it's not as good as it used to  be which it isn't and they'll just keep  chewing it apart 200 parts so that by  the time he goes to satellite his  listeners will be disgusted this is their  strategy this is what radio wants to do  they don't want to send a successful  howard stern over to satellite radio so  they will do what they have to do to  dismantle his show and before he leaves 
[01:25:30]  and he'll sit there and take it because  he's a pussy  and his daughter has really nice tits  big  luscious  juicy ones  a little bit of a fat back on her but  she's gonna be fat in a couple years but  right now she's really sexy with really  big boobs  grab those  very sexy those big jewish boobs  anthony  we ruined his vacation i know for a fact we  still have a lot of spies at the company  we absolutely ruined his two weeks off

[01:38:30]  Exactly.  Every time.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program.  Jim Norton is very happy over there in the corner. 
[01:39:00]  Yep.  Well, are you officially in a corner?  Not really.  It's kind of like an Octagon studio, so you're kind of like in, I don't know.  It's on a side.  Yeah, you're in your little area over there.  And you got an email that went to the entire company?  Yes, it didn't go to me, but Ben brought it in, and there's a man named Dan Turner, who  I don't believe I've met yet.  Dan Turner rocks, by the way.  I want to give him a hug.  He's one of the good ones at XM.  Yeah.  One of the good ones.  I'd like to give him a nice hug.  He gets it big time.  A hug.  A hug.  A hug.  And a very friendly, hey, like, the type of, this is the sound we make on each other's 
[01:39:30]  backs.  Oh.  Like a man's hug.  Right.  Not like a Gene Simmons kicked you down the stairs.  No, no, no.  And now he's hugging you.  No, no.  To make you feel better.  Not like a look at me with your demon makeup and wipe my tears away, Gene.  Look.  No.  A hug.  Of course.  This is just an email he sent out.  It seems like everyone in the company.  I believe it was CC'd to some people in Sirius as well.  It said, last week, by the way, if I ever use a term like CC'd again, throw hot soup in 
[01:40:00]  my fat face.  CC'd.  CC'd.  Corporate dullard I'm turning into.  Last week, ONA had a good 17 minutes on how the folks with the Broadway channel were  highly offended when using the ONA studio for a Broadway interview.  Yes.  It seems that there was some offense taken to some of the materials on display in the  studio.  That would be the naked girls.  Naked girls.  The old sign with shit dick.  Right.  Written on it.  This is the exact reason why I had expressed concern about the studio request below, and  it has an email below requesting the use of this studio. 
[01:40:30]  Yes, there are technical implications in using that studio, but moreover, that studio is  dedicated to the purpose of the ONA show, and he has three dots, period.  Oh.  Effective immediately, that studio is off limits for any usage other than for the creation and  support of the ONA show.  I'm actually filling up reading this.  Programming personnel are not to use this studio for other channel purposes, and no requests  for the use of this studio will be accepted.  Don't even ask. 
[01:41:00]  It's funny.  It doesn't say, and some requests will be accepted, or occasionally a request will be  accepted.  It says, and no requests for this usage will be accepted.  Until such a time that we are able to expand or relocate the current New York studio operation,  any requests for interviews, et cetera, will have to be accommodated through the existing  multifunction studio, i.e. closet.  The closet with a microphone in it.  Yeah.  It will have to be through the existing multifunction studio or outside resources will have to be 
[01:41:30]  contracted.  If there are any questions, please let me know.  I won't have this happen again.  Thanks, Dan.  And he says, if you want to write comments about the size of his bulge or anything, you  can email him at ben.sparks at xmradio.com to talk about what you feel about Broadway and  Broadway shows.  And I got to tell you, this is the beauty.  It's nice to see somebody in a corporation do this, because people are such babies in  corporations.  Anything can be misconstrued as a harassing atmosphere. 
[01:42:00]  And they see some baby coming in here, and maybe there's a more explicit thing hanging  on the wall, and they sue the company for sexual harassment.  They've just said, no one comes in.  Thank you very much.  And they were the one asking if they could come in here and use the studio.  They come in to use it, and they're offended by things on the wall.  And then you got a lawsuit on your hand.  It's kind of scary.  We get our way every time.  It's starting to get embarrassing.  It's really starting to get embarrassing, though.  But you're right about it.  I would never walk into that other studio and hang up something inappropriate.  To me, that's harassment, and that's inappropriate. 
[01:42:30]  I wouldn't do it.  But this is our house.  It is.  I mean, granted, I was a scumbag when I walked in.  I saw the Sinatra records, and I started making remarks about flinging them down the  hallway.  Anthony and I...  Certainly did.  Like a jerk.  Anthony and I came up with something years ago.  Basically, it says, Opie and Anthony always win in the end.  Right.  Sometimes it takes some...  I don't know.  Some time.  But in the end, we always win.  Yes.  We always win in the end.  It's disgusting.  We haven't lost yet.  But you were right.  This is a case where you were completely right.  Somebody walked into your living room, didn't appreciate what you had hanging in your own 
[01:43:00]  house, and wanted to complain about it.  If you walked into that closet studio because you needed to use it for some reason...  Right.  And let's just say, off the top of my head, there was a picture of a huge man's mule...  Right.  ...just hanging on the wall.  Right.  Would you all of a sudden start complaining to people around here?  I'd probably push a couple of the jackets that were hanging up in there over and cover  it.  No, I wouldn't care.  Studio smells like mothballs.  No, I could care less. 
[01:43:30]  I don't care what anybody does in their studio.  I really don't.  It's not my business.  It has nothing to do with me, and it wouldn't offend me.  All right, there you go.  There's the update.  The show is a soap opera.  There's all sorts of things always happening, and...  We keep you updated.  We keep you updated.  That's the latest.  We won that little battle.  Thank you, Dan.  Thank you.  All right.  Dare I call him Dan the Man?  Ooh.  Ooh, very nice.  That's something I just thought up.  Very nice.  That could stick.  Let's go to Brian in Jersey.  Brian, what's up?  Yo.  Yo, I'm with you.  I'm surprised you guys came to me.  Howard's talking to... 
[01:44:00]  Am I on the radio right now?  Yeah, go ahead.  You certainly are.  Yo, Howard is bitching about you guys.  He is seriously crying right now.  This lady called up, and she was specifically...  She said, yo, I'm sorry.  I got to say goodbye, Howard.  I'm a list.  I was a faithful listener for 10 years, but you're off the radio.  So Howard's still going on and on about you guys.  They're trying to justify it.  They're like, I didn't leave you high and dry for a year.  They're talking about the guy, the Hindu guy, I think.  Farade, yes.  Hindu guy.  Jesus.  They're like, yeah, I didn't leave you high and dry. 
[01:44:30]  I don't understand why, you know, I gave you a year notice.  Why don't you just try and give you, figure out in 06 where you want to, what you want  to replace me with.  But they replaced me with Open Anthony.  And then he's trying to justify saying how having you guys on the radio is just going  to make their listeners want to hear Howard more.  I have no idea.  Oh, yeah, because that's exactly what happened in New York when we built our own audience  in his backyard.  Trust me, he is livid that Farade decided to replace us. 
[01:45:00]  Replace us.  I'm messing up like you.  Replace him with us in Syracuse.  You know?  The guy doesn't have a clue.  He thinks he could crap on Farade and crap on Citadel and sit there and they're going to  do nothing.  They're going to still kiss his ass and play his show.  No, sorry, Howie.  It doesn't work that way.  You crapped on too many people and now they're telling you to go F off.  And that's how it works.  Bye-bye.  This is pretty much payback for calling Farade a terrorist. 
[01:45:30]  Remember that one, Howard?  That was a good one.  That's great.  When everyone was scared about the whole 9-11 attacks and this and that, you were so preoccupied  with yourself that you're calling your boss a terrorist because he wouldn't shut Anthony  and I up.  Remember that one?  It's not 1987 anymore, Howard.  Bye-bye.  Remember the old days when you wouldn't even dream of letting Howard go?  It was the old days.  It's not the old days anymore.  It doesn't matter anymore.  You can't crap on these people and they're just going to sit there and take it. 
[01:46:00]  It's not how it works anymore.  Jess.  So now they yank you off the air and you deal with it.  So when you go to satellite, whenever that is, you'll have no listeners left because they  won't have heard you for a year.  They move on, people.  They tend to move on.  He played right into our hands again.  Yeah.  Good.  Once again, he played right into our hands.  Goody good.  We have about a tenth of his listeners right now because we know where we're starting over 
[01:46:30]  and we're building every day and eventually we'll be on top again because we always win  in the end.  You'll see.  You'll see.  Yeah.  And so, you know, he has ten times the audience right now and he's mentioning our names.  Opie and Anthony, Opie and Anthony, Opie and Anthony, Opie and Anthony.  Nice commercial.  Perfect.  Thank you.  It's a commercial.  See, we keep poking and poking and poking until you have to acknowledge us.  Yeah.  You really are nudges.  We are the worst.  Just to have to come back from vacation and deal with you two again. 
[01:47:00]  He didn't even have a vacation.  The first day on vacation, he had to get that call from one of his minions saying that,  guess what happened?  Opie and Anthony are now being hurt in Syracuse instead of you.  His vacation was ruined.  I guarantee it.  I guarantee it.  Oh, well.  Let's go to Ricky in Yonkers.  Ricky, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Hey, buddy.  What's up?  Hey, I just sent in to Howard the moment the caller called in and said he was talking about  it.  Yeah.  And he just said, oh, I'm going to be the bigger man and not say the story. 
[01:47:30]  I'm just going to let this be.  But, you know, you can figure it out.  Yeah.  Trust me.  I mean, just listen to all the fake laughter around him and stuff.  He's livid.  He's pissed off.  He doesn't know what to do about it.  And honestly, he can't do anything about it.  Not at all.  And it's going to happen in a lot more of his markets across America.  This is just the beginning.  It's just the beginning.  You'll see.  Have fun.  Have fun.  Have fun, Howie. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  Let's just tell the story about what happened the day before you signed that big, huge five-year  deal, which is about four years ago now, Anthony.  Wow.  Matter of fact.  That was a while ago.  It was about four years ago.  Ouch.  Do you want to be honest with your listeners?  Someone call up Howard right now.  Yeah.  He'll put you right on the air.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, Howard.  You know about four years ago when you signed that five-year contract and Mel Karmazin was  on the show with you in the morning and you guys were all celebrating.  You might have even been drinking a little champagne. 
[01:48:30]  You were going to be with the company another five years.  Yeah.  Why don't you tell your listeners how many hours you slept that night and why you didn't  sleep?  Probably not many.  That'd be a nice story.  Yeah, we know it was St. Vincent's Hospital and Ben relaxed.  It'd be a nice story.  You could talk about what a great dad you are.  Ben was right outside.  That was when...  Hey, Ben's the king.  He knows how to get things done. 
[01:49:00]  Ben is everywhere.  He is everywhere.  Dude, you're not going to believe where I am.  I'll never forget the call.  First-hand gossip.  I saw his forerunner going around the corner with his assistant driving around the corner.  I was at the Park Central Hotel and I get a phone call from this freaking nutcase in  the middle of the night.  You're not going to believe where I am with my tiny cell phone.  You know how Yoko knew that John got shot?  She heard him outside going, dude, who's copy of Catcher in the Rye?  We make fun of Ben, but, you know, half the stuff he comes up with is true. 
[01:49:30]  Even more than half.  He's the inquirer.  That's what Ben is.  He's the inquirer with a retard lump in the front.  He sounds ridiculous, but he's got about a 75% to 80% batting average, which is phenomenal.  So, now they're saying we are on in Harrisburg?  When were they going to tell us?  Mark in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, you guys are on in Harrisburg.  How do you know? 
[01:50:00]  I just had one of our other drivers.  I just called him and I told him to tune in and he said you guys are on and Howard's off.  In Harrisburg now.  So, it's growing in front of our eyes.  I know it's definitely Syracuse.  Now, it's Harrisburg?  When was Fareed going to call us and tell us that he added Harrisburg to this little experiment?  I don't know.  Are you sure he's not just listening to his XM, sir?  No, he doesn't even have that XM.  Okay, that'd be awful.  You're on in Florida.  My God, you're on in Poughkeepsie.  Tell that ass to get it.  And where the hell is Harrisburg? 
[01:50:30]  Does anyone know?  It's the capital of Pennsylvania, Opie.  Yeah, but where is it?  Somewhere in Pennsylvania.  Exactly.  Yo, guys, I got a punch out.  I meant to hold a Lincoln Tunnel and a cop's giving me a dirty look.  All right, thank you.  All right.  Let's go to Rob on Long Island.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  How you doing, sweet Ted?  How you doing, Rob?  Thanks for calling the program.  Hope you had a happy, safe New Year.  No problem there, Jimmy.  Yeah, I keep flipping back and forth to Howard, to you guys, to hear what's going on.  There's been a few callers that have been calling Howard from all across the country,  and they've all been saying that they're hearing you guys instead of hearing him. 
[01:51:00]  I think Fareed's got you in at least four or five different markets.  I think a guy from Michigan called saying that.  He's like, yeah, Howard, I miss you so much.  I really don't know.  We'll get to the bottom of it after the show, but I guess we're on in Syracuse today and  maybe Harrisburg and possibly other cities to follow, Anthony, right?  I heard Fareed hurt his back, by the way.  He was carrying one of his own wine gifts. 
[01:51:30]  Nice Christmas present.  Yeah, thanks, Fareed.  Jesus.  Tanker of wine.  Yeah, thanks for the gift.  We didn't even have time to wrap it.  We had that secret meeting with Fareed, and it was right around the holidays, and we  haven't talked to the guy in a while because he was bad-mouthing us in the press.  But hey, now we're all friends again.  All friends.  It's like WWF.  This business stinks.  WWE.  You know, don't be confused.  This business stinks.  Yeah.  You know, you think you make friends, and the next thing you know, you get fired, and your 
[01:52:00]  friends stop calling, and then you make new friends.  Then you make friends with the enemies.  Up until you need something from one of the enemies, and then you're friends again.  So I think, technically, Fareed was an enemy there for a while.  When we first signed with Satellite Radio, he was bad-mouthing us in the press a little  bit, which I took him to task on when we had our little meeting.  And then now he needs us because, you know, he's sick of Howard and Howard's BS, so he  calls us.  He knows that we're the ones that get under Howard's skin, right?  Oh, hell yeah.  So we're having this meeting, and it's around Christmas time. 
[01:52:30]  He's like, oh, my God.  So he quickly left the conference room in the middle of this huge top-secret meeting  and comes back with these cases of wine that he didn't have time to wrap.  Obviously, he was sending these to all his people all over the country that run radio  stations for him.  Mine said, Merry Christmas, Howard on it.  It was scratched out.  So I was even replacing him as the person to give a gift to.  And then he comes walking in with these three cases of wine that weighed at least 50 pounds  each, and then these makeshift cards where he kind of just quickly wrote, you know, Happy 
[01:53:00]  Holidays, Fareed.  He didn't even write, like, Opie or Anthony or Jim Norton.  It was the stamp.  Right.  It was just stamping.  Merry Christmas, Fareed.  And I got to tell you, Judy's the other woman who works there, right?  Yeah.  Judy and her assistant was so hot.  Oh, when she came peeking in at one point.  Oh, she helped me make coffee.  But, yeah, she peeked in and said, anyone need coffee?  Oh, she helped me make it.  A stunning girl.  Oh, she lovely.  Peeked in.  That's what I took out of that whole meeting. 
[01:53:30]  A backache and a hot chick.  I know.  We're like, could you repeat that?  We were too busy looking at your hot assistant.  Oh, she a fantastic girl.  We are the worst.  We looked like three retards carrying those boxes out.  Yeah.  Those big, heavy wine boxes.  Yeah, and we couldn't.  What are you going to do?  You know, you can't just leave it there.  Someone will trip over it and kill themselves.  Yeah.  You know, the authorities will think it's a bomb if you leave it in the street.  They'll have to close off the road.  You know.  How close were we to piling the boxes up right next to the elevator?  If we had any balls, that's what we would have done. 
[01:54:00]  And he would have called them.  What happened?  And we just would have left.  But we're just, you know.  Because they would have been left there until Fareed came out to use the elevator.  He would have looked and went, wait a minute.  That's the same wine.  Oh, those bastards.  Yeah, just three big wine boxes.  Now that I think about it, we really did wimp out.  We should have left him right at the elevator.  No, we were there.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Having to, like, lean to one side and grab it with one arm to shake his hand.  Bye.  Looking all stupid.  You put it in the taxi.  It was like the opening of the Flintstones when they put that stupid.  The ribs on the side and the car tips over. 
[01:54:30]  One bottle would have been nice.  Yeah, one bottle.  A case.  I mean, what are we doing with a case of awful white wine?  A case.  Have you been drinking it?  No, the stuff stinks.  It's awful.  I drank a little bit of it.  You got it in bulk.  I got such a hangover the next day from drinking some of that stuff.  Hey.  I don't want to say it was garbage, but I saw toenails on the glass after I poured it.  Got it?  Let's go to Ron in California.  Ron, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Morning.  Morning, Jimmy.  Hi, Ron.  Hey, I just want to let you guys know you are Howard Stern Tsunami. 
[01:55:00]  Oh, we have been for many, many years.  Many years.  Just wiping him out.  He is just sniveling this morning.  Oh, he hates us.  And we love it.  Many years.  See, because we don't take this radio thing seriously in the end, you know?  We know how to get under people's skin.  We know how to make ourselves bigger.  And once again, it worked like a charm.  Howard's doing a huge O&A commercial today.  Huge O&A commercial.  We have maybe the tenth of the audience that he has right now.  We need people to know about us.  Of course.  That's what you do in radio.  You get guys that have, I was going to say bigger, but that's really not true, but guys 
[01:55:30]  that have a bigger audience than you to talk about you.  And guess what happens?  Because that makes you bigger.  That's the oldest trick in radio.  One more and then we move on.  Tim in Orlando.  What's up, Tim?  Hey, man.  Yeah, I just turned on 105.9 to listen to see what old Starron was saying.  Yeah.  He's calling y'all the Earl and Opie show.  What the fuck is that?  The Earl and Opie show.  That's hilarious.  Yeah.  That's what he was calling it just a few minutes ago when he was talking about y'all. 
[01:56:00]  I don't know what that means.  What the hell does that mean?  I have no damn clue.  I couldn't figure that one out neither.  But he was talking about some damn raghead taking him off the radio and putting the Earl  and Opie show on.  The Earl and Opie show.  Yeah.  Hey, that's pretty creative.  Good stuff.  Very clever, Howard.  Hey, man.  I got to tell y'all guys, y'all are number one.  I really like the show, man.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Thank you, Tim.  Thanks, man. 
[01:56:30]  All right.  The Earl and Opie show.  Ben and Reno.  What's up, Ben?  Ben?  Yes.  Ben?  Ben?  Wait, he's snoring.  Jesus.  He fell asleep.  We get this time to time.  Time to time every morning.  It's very early.  It's very disheartening.  Our own executive producer kind of yawns during the show and our call is full of sleep.  And the call's name is Ben.  Maybe we should just get out of this business.  Listen to this guy. 
[01:57:00]  It's very early in some parts of the country when we come on.  People are on hold for a little while.  Perhaps he's laying in bed.  Something caught his fancy he wanted to comment on.  He called up and he's all comfy in bed.  Why do we even bother doing a radio show if half our listeners can't even stay awake for it?  We are awful.  We are the worst.  We're trying to make people laugh.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM.  We stink.  This is just awful.  Listen.  Listen.  This is our listeners. 
[01:57:30]  There he is.  Opie and Anthony show.  Do not exceed recommended dosage.  All right.  Well, this guy's been on hold a half hour already.  Well, let's wreck his phone bill today.  We'll just keep him right there.  Oh, we truly are NyQuil.  Look at that.  Lunchbox.  What's up, Lunchbox?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey.  Just wanted to let you guys know you guys are going to that CES show over there in Vegas. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  Sumer Electronics show.  Yes, in Vegas.  Yeah, and I used to work for a car stereo company back in the day, and when I went to  the show, the lower level is a porn convention.  Oh, no.  We know that.  Oh, yeah.  AVN, dude.  Yeah, we know.  That's what's so weird.  It's a bunch of geeks and a bunch of porn stars in the same place at the same time.  I thought Jimmy Norton would like that.  Oh, dude.  I love the AVN.  I made some good friends there, and I can't wait to go to the expo and see some of my friends.  Tag teamed a girl with Ron Jeremy. 
[01:58:30]  I did tag team a girl with Ron Jeremy.  I'd love to.  He told me I had a nice piece.  Ron's a good guy.  All right.  Thank you.  You guys rock, and I appreciate it.  Thanks, man.  Well, we've got to take a quick break here.  We've got to get into the thing.  Hippo eats dwarf?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, no.  I'm sorry.  Oh, we didn't get to hippo eats dwarf.  No, no.  I think it was better, anyway.  No, we're going to do both.  And then Anthony and I, one of our fine radio stories made this month's issue of FHM Magazine  with Terry Hatcher on the cover.  We're in that issue, the February issue, it looks like. 
[01:59:00]  February 2005 issue.  Terry Hatcher looks pretty good on that cover.  Pretty good.  She looks really good.  The whole spread of her in there.  I love how they call it a spread.  I'm not sure.  Is it?  It should be if she's on the cover.  We'll have to take a peek through the whole magazine and see.  So we've got lots of show to do, and we'll continue.  For seven cents a day, you can get Opie and Anthony.  Or feed this little kid with the flies on his face.  But you want to laugh, don't you?  You don't want to be depressed watching starving children. 
[01:59:30]  So turn them up and turn on Opie and Anthony.  And we'll send you a photo of the child if you're healthy in the outfit of your choice.  The Opie and Anthony Show.

[02:06:30]  howie huh with this oh yeah this clever banter that he comes up with after two weeks off  yes uh jimmy hippo eats dwarf all right let's go in bangkok this is a true story gang  in bangkok huh and what what paper is this out of um it was actually off a lot like aol or something  like that oh then it's got to be true a hippopotamus swallowed a circus dwarf in a freak accident in  northern thailand according to a columnist in the pitaya mail probably some savage newspaper of course 
[02:07:00]  the grapevine column reported a circus dwarf nicknamed ode ode died recently when he bounced  sideways from a trampoline and was swallowed by a yawning hippopotamus oh that might not be true  waiting to appear in the next act you're just someone just yawning in a studio and a little  midget flew into his mouth but it wasn't a midget it was just a lump in the front of his jeans  then it could be dangerous to yawn let's have a midget fly into your mouth vets said hilda the  hippo had a gag reflex which caused her to swallow more than a thousand spectators continued to applaud 
[02:07:30]  wildly until they realized there had been a tragic mistake what was the tragic mistake that more  midgets weren't loaded onto that thing to bounce into the yawning hippo mouth i'd pay to see that so  would i there's one little family photograph embarrassment swallowed are you buying that story i cannot buy  that story i don't remember i did get it off of line um i could have been fake as i was reading it  this is from the weekly world news dude as i was reading it i didn't read i only kind of read the 
[02:08:00]  headline because that's about as much show prep as i do right and i saw bangkok i'm like funny word  email to ben but it said here he died recently when he bounced sideways from a trampoline into a  yawning hippo mouth yeah now that gotta be three to one if he's just taking a little midget swim or  something and a hippo came up and ate him that's one thing yeah but to to bounce into his mouth off  a little trampoline while the hippo's yawning apparently listening to this program everything  has to be just perfect for that to happen right yeah you have to have yeah our show on in the background 
[02:08:30]  to cause the hippo to yawn you're right i read a similar story in sweden where the midget fell into his  mouth when the hippo was yodeling you're even turning red on that one wow you do have a really  good batting average today though i don't mind i just as it came out i actually i was just a little  dribbler down the first baseline there not only was it not a dribbler it bounced off the plate and 
[02:09:00]  hit me in the knuckle because here's why that one stunk so bad because i had high hopes for it  as i was firing it out i'm already anticipating the laugh so i'm figuring in the ensuing laughter  i'll have time to think of other countries where i can put in funny things the hippo could be doing  nope no no sir the hippo was yodeling yodeling was he the hippo was yodeling all right anthony well  we're in the latest issue of fhm magazine terry hatcher's on the cover it's the february issue if 
[02:09:30]  you're looking for it on newsstands yes and um i don't know anthony and i have been doing radio for  about 10 years together now and uh we have a lot of funny stories that have happened to us obviously  and and there's um there's a lot of interest on uh possibly writing a book or something and uh we're  still trying to figure that all out and uh i don't know from time to time these magazines ask ask us for  a story and these are all very very true stories of things that we've done in the past  and uh we're in the section true story of the month true story of the month to get an appropriate 
[02:10:00]  true story for this comedy issue fhm went to the one duo whose every waking moment is either an  embarrassing tale uh or a ridiculous uh antidote opian anthony xm satellite what anecdote anecdote  anecdote yeah anecdote take an antidote we all know i have lazy mouth in the morning opian anthony  xm satellite radio's weekday morning hooligans we just point them out because it uh keeps the  instant feedback from being tied up for an hour with people bragging yeah so weird though man like 
[02:10:30]  two in the afternoon i i speak oh you don't you don't like c's in the morning no i don't like  them in the afternoon all that all right so um uh the story uh they they illustrated this one  anthony they gave us a whole page and they did cartoons again they did a great job illustrating  this can we throw this up on our website or or does fhm want people to actually buy the magazine  just to read this little story we should um scan it yeah i'm sure we have a scanner around here with 
[02:11:00]  the printer and everything look at everyone shaking their head no of course we don't maybe steve could  just videotape it while you're holding it and put it up online somehow like a hostage with a newspaper  the date on it uh let's go to matt in jersey he's going to call you out on your story by the way go  ahead matt yeah you're a complete moron this is a 1999 drawing award yeah is it also the uh i i thought  jim was going to break out the jet engine on the roof of the car story too i'll do this all right 
[02:11:30]  what is it someone might have emailed i don't remember how i got my greedy little mitts on what  is it according to this it was originally on the national inquiry in 1982 as dog communicates with the  dead so you're just a moron wait wait it was in that issue it's a it's an i thought it's you're a  moron all right i know that dude but explain me why you're bringing it he's just calling you a moron  and you're bringing in fake news stories for this program i didn't realize it was program i didn't  realize you're dan rather what are you doing i insist you haven't checked your sources 
[02:12:00]  well i as i was reading it i realized the little fella hit the trampoline wrong and went into the  yawning mouth then i kind of as i was reading it i realized that it's an old inquirer story  the 80s look i i don't i don't realize i appreciate that you're you're starting to bring you know  material to the show but i brought some audio i brought two different specials i i did i watched  this night uh audio type of thing morning shows in like des moines iowa do  i the wacky darwin awards uh story but i really did think it was legit another winner of the darwin 
[02:12:30]  awards i tell you about the guy that used the 22 bullet as a uh fuse in his truck see his fuse  blew out for his headlights but he was driving home and he didn't have another fuse what he did  that was ammunition for his 22 caliber rifle what he did was he stuck that shell into the fuse hole  and uh the headlights came on but the short was still there that blew the fuse so in time the  bullet heated up and shot him right in his testicles i actually have more respect for 
[02:13:00]  that story than i do for randy johnson signs with yankees i prefer a shot in the bag story  did you hear the other story uh it's similar to that the guy got shot in his bag it went through  his yam bag yeah and hit a uh a girl in the uh abdomen yeah and nicked her ovary yeah and she wound  up getting pregnant shut up the gunshot and that find that story and that is where the saying  he's a son of a gun came from someone find that i just read that over the weekend as some 
[02:13:30]  news story that was like this is totally false this did not happen it dates back to like the civil war  they're just these like rumors that that one of our listeners that is good at uh research find that  story for us you can find it on snopes snopes snopes.com which dispels everything whenever i  get an email of course not one from uh xm because i never get any from xm but whenever i get an email  uh and and it's one of those news stories that are just like wait a minute this can't be true 
[02:14:00]  i go to snopes.com and then you pop it in the search engine and it comes up true or false or  inconclusive or something like that but so many people email you this crap and no dude it's the truth  check this out like that what it was one that some idiot told me uh god it was like minutes ago  oh a hippopotamus and a midget uh was on a trampoline  i really have an ass oh wow let's go to ryan and i really thought it was real that's why i would  never bring in a wacky story of course jimmy um before we begin i want to thank you for uh bringing 
[02:14:30]  40 minutes of material to the program today you might say 40 that story only took two minutes to  read oh no thanks for the 40 minutes of of radio you're about to give us ryan in jersey yes ryan  guys how are you pretty good hey cupcake how are you today i've been better ryan i wanted to know  if you heard anything new about the bat boy they found in that came to new york oh bad boy  oh right  jimmy was so excited oh i'm a gullible tart listen to the replay he brings it up that he has this great 
[02:15:00]  story about three or four times oh i know you gotta get what i brought to the program today  dude i was just so happy that a midget had been dwarf there's a difference whatever it is it's just  something that comes out half the time a regular baby does i was just happy that something of that  height had died tragically right i did not go over the story with a fine tooth comb as they say or in  a fine tooth firecracker  do you know uh jimmy loves taking celebrity pictures we know that yes uh do you know he 
[02:15:30]  actually took the picture of clinton with the alien oh yeah that was on the cover of uh the weekly  world news so many years ago jimmy norton credited with that photo i am a gullible fool anthony is is  um is this it let me see uh claim during the civil war a woman was impregnated by sperm carrot on a  bullet that passed through the scrotum of a soldier and penetrated her ovaries status is false the origin 
[02:16:00]  sometimes touted as the origin of the phrase son of a gun uh the tale of the bullet through the balls  is well-traveled uh well-traveled legend often reported by such infamous urban legend vectors as dear  abby oh yeah she's she's been fooled by a lot of uh urban legend over the years uh here's the story  it seemed that during the civil war may 12 1863 to be exact a young virginia farm girl was standing 
[02:16:30]  on her front porch while a battle was raging nearby a stray bullet first passed through the scrotum of  a young union cavalryman then lodged in the reproductive tract of the young woman who thus became pregnant by  a man she had not been within 100 feet of and nine months later she gave birth to a healthy  baby the story in fact is completely false the claim for this miraculous bullet pregnancy originated  uh the american medical weekly on uh november 7th 1874 so it's it's had some legs over the years 
[02:17:00]  some of these stories go way back but it is false can someone put the um hippo story into snopes  see if it comes up well do you know how dude you know how they knew that was false because after after  the guy got shot through the scrotum there's video of him actually holding his hat and not letting it  go and then it went through the scrotum right and this magic bullet uh where's uh snopes there you  almost gave me the crickets i might have deserved them but that was kind of no that was a good reference 
[02:17:30]  yeah it wasn't a bad it was kind of a magic bullet i was on the fence i was on the fence i could have  said there was on the cricket button i could have said the one bullet missed and hit general general  grant a little chip hit him in the face but i didn't because that would have been a james tague  comparison glad your brother and three other people are probably enjoying that weird jfk reference  got the right ta-ta but the wrong hole all right here is a story all right um let me see back  urban legend miscellaneous newspaper an australian circus dwarf died recently when he bounced sideways 
[02:18:00]  from a trampoline it was swallowed by a hippopotamus it was yawning oh come on that's great  oh my goodness stop it that is a uh yeah it's being reported as an australian dwarf though where was  yours from thailand thailand the locations change things happen but but the ass remains the same when he 
[02:18:30]  brings it in people watched as little franz dash popped into the mouth of hilda the hippo was it  hilda yeah it was hilda and the animal's gag reflex forced it to swallow the crowd applauded  yeah well there you go so they're saying it's false of course it's false well this guy's saying  it's true jim in tennessee go ahead jim i myth busters did a thing on that about a month ago 
[02:19:00]  um i love myth busters by the way it's two guys that uh try to uh bust or prove the urban legends  that are around they've been measuring black penises for four years  trying to find one to break that  some dumbass some dumbass actually used a 22 bullet as a fuse and it did go off but all it did was hit  him in the leg it didn't it did not it's an urban legend i'm telling you they they had they had their 
[02:19:30]  crash dummy set up and it hit him in the leg okay that's how oh and myth busters the other uh story  that's been reported um as true over the years is the one we just mentioned about a week or two ago  the whole match and the gerbil and the right the gerbil where the uh two gay guys were uh having sex  and one put a gerbil uh where the sun don't shine there and um how does the story start in retrospect  in retrospect lighting the match wasn't a good idea they were in the hospital and he was kind of 
[02:20:00]  reflecting on what had happened one guy had a burnt face burnt face and a broken nose burnt uh bunghole  the other guy had a burnt uh bunghole yeah burnt balloon knot and uh it turns out they had put a  gerbil in there with a string to get him out uh the string fell off they couldn't get the gerbil out  so one guy was lighting a match and kind of looking inside to try to find the gerbil so he  could pick him out let's let's pick this why would you light the match to see you know where the gerbil  is well opie in retrospect lighting the match wasn't a good idea all right that's where he was a dumb 
[02:20:30]  ass he should use a little mag light or something but you know where it is it's not right up there  you don't need a match just dig in and try to pull him out there you go understand completely  but uh you know he lit the match and the buildup of methane gas shot the mouse out the gerbil out like a  cannon and it hit him in the face breaking oh the guy had a broken nose yeah broken nose and the  other guy had the face yeah yeah yeah okay and that's an urban legend but here i am also on snopes  looking at the uh a pair of arkansas rednecks are injured using 22 caliber shell in place of a burnt 
[02:21:00]  out automobile fuse false just never happened uh whether it was proven on that uh tv show that it  could happen or not is one thing but you know we're talking about things that have happened exactly  we interrupt this program to bring you the ozone midget sighting of the day look at this is it on  a trampoline uh ken in houston the hippo hey what's up guys what's up ken hey i was getting up sunday  morning turned on the tv and saw an infomercial that the hosts were two identical twin midgets 
[02:21:30]  oh the real estate guys oh i love those guys i'm gonna teach you how to make a fortune in real  estate you little freak it was like cashflow generator dot com something stupid like that  it was ridiculous because they had their little business suits on and then the no neck looked like  the suit was trying to swallow their head their little business were they sitting on those stools  with their feet sticking straight out yeah to see the soles of their shoes on television  that's exactly what it was embarrassing little physique little miniature atrocities 
[02:22:00]  oh that's it guys i'm punching out all right thank you bye there he goes there's ken in uh houston  i don't know that was okay meanwhile back at the show yeah that isn't really a midget sighting that's  a midget viewing and i'm surprised that they're still running those infomercials that was about 10  yeah that was a while ago 10 years ago those guys have money they buy their little little teeny suits  how much could a little suit like that cost the child's confirmation section 
[02:22:30]  gotta be a third of the price of a regular suit all right so we're in fhm magazine the latest issue  the uh february issue with terry hatcher on the uh cover and we tell one of our stories true story  of the month and it's illustrated they gave us a whole page it was uh it was our little thanks uh  thanksgiving uh thing we did this bit by the way uh it definitely bordered on the wacky you think  yeah it's one of those kind of it sounds like a radio type gag you know yeah but i don't think 
[02:23:00]  if i don't i don't know it didn't turn out as a wacky bit no no it certainly didn't that's why  it went horribly wrong there were cops involved and everything horribly wrong horribly wrong horribly  wrong well basically uh i mean i mean you got to pick up the magazine just to see the illustrations  they're pretty funny but basically uh this is what happened it says opie in november 1997 we had this  competition where we were going to let 50 turkeys loose in a field and listeners would get a chance 
[02:23:30]  to catch one thanksgiving it's coming around the holidays so we figured we'd have a contest  it was called uh catch your own turkey catch your own turkey we're thinking you know let's go back  to the old days when you really had to go out in the field and get to get dinner yeah because you  know thanksgiving uh holiday dinner you got all the food on the table and it was pretty easy you just  went to the store and picked it up but we were talking about you know the older days we actually had  to go out there and hunt your own stuff and we figured we'd do that i don't want to bring that  back we'd figure we'd do that in the middle of framingham massachusetts oh the mutants that would  come from lull with weapons yeah so then anthony says here in the in the illustration callers told 
[02:24:00]  us about the crazy makeshift weapons they made with hockey sticks rakes nets hammers anything to  catch a turkey so we mentioned this on the air and then uh the listeners started calling like crazy  they were buying a hook line and sinker right away and they're like uh can we just bring anything  can we bring guns we're like well you can't bring guns no guns but anything else has to be a hand  weapon so like well can i bring a hockey stick can me and my friend bring like a fishing net i want  to bring a baseball bat with nails in it yeah sure yeah bring it chainsaw i mean the things they came 
[02:24:30]  up with were just you know more wacky than the bit itself anthony and uh they were yeah they were  really psyched to do this right they really and we were getting calls from the aspca uh very angry  calls from animal rights activists they did not want us to go forward with this it was a pretty big  story for the time oh of course and then uh so then uh the day came that we were going to do this  in this field in uh framingham so we drove up to this vacant field in framingham massachusetts in  our massive waf rock bus remember that thing that was awesome yeah the things we saw on that bus oh boy 
[02:25:00]  oh boy did we see things i know out the window that day though we were seeing lots of mullets  those massachusetts you definitely weren't getting the cultured educated people from boston  coming to this event they came out they came out of the woodwork for this one it was mullets from  lowell it was and uh worcester worcester yeah it was like a touring bus for bands but it was our  broadcast center there were hundreds of listeners who showed up all with stuff that looked like they're  going after frankenstein yeah they pretty much had everything except like the torches looked like an 
[02:25:30]  angry mob angry mob and we could not believe that the people were showing up with their  baseball bats and their hockey sticks and their crowbars and their pitchforks and yeah and golf  clubs i mean you name it they had everyone had the secondary video game weapons that you you only  have when you don't have any guns on you yeah yeah you got a breakout yeah a shovel exactly there yeah  all right and the illustrations is really really fantastic in this uh little piece or something all 
[02:26:00]  right so so then uh we told everyone that the turkeys were out there in the field i mean this was a  huge field and we're like oh no they're way i mean they're a good quarter mile away you got to get  out there because the turkeys are a little scared you know so they're far out there in the woods had  turkey calls those things that they would like blow into yeah they showed up with uh i forgot that yeah  with hunting gear and everything wearing camo and stuff mutants so we told uh yeah we told everyone  that the turkeys were out there then we counted down to three and let them loose what we didn't tell 
[02:26:30]  them was that we had actually put paper turkeys out in the field not real ones that was the gag  paper turkeys paper did i mess up that word too no you said put so put you you said it so correctly  so perfectly i figured i'd say paper i walk around my neighborhood now just going put put put put put put  put put do it fast and people think you're driving an imaginary car put put put put uh yeah that was the  gag we we had stupid paper turkeys but the listeners bought it hook line and sinker see that's a little 
[02:27:00]  zany i know up in the hey it's paper turkey in the tree yeah we had them under some leaves near some  rocks you know out in the field and uh yeah the not real turkeys obviously and if they caught it but  if they found it says here if they caught a paper turkey but if they found one of these paper turkeys  they would bring it back to the rock bus we were broadcasting in uh-huh now and we're thinking they  wouldn't be pissed off i'm like ah you know thanks for being part of the gag and we give them a  a gift certificate for a frozen turkey for their family for thanksgiving they can go down to shaw's 
[02:27:30]  and pick up a turkey yeah yeah so uh chester loves turkey he also loves prime rib he obviously did like  the prime rib that day but he didn't like kicks in the side he definitely liked the prime rib anthony  oh yeah he did and so did i after i uh rinsed it out under the sink to get all the dog hair off it  i must you must have been hungry man i i was very hungry that day you gotta be hungry if you're willing 
[02:28:00]  to kill a dog and i didn't kill no dog stop with the rumors all right all i know is my prime rib was  on the rug the dog was throwing coke with a where the cat liked to you know lay and right and there  was a lot of cat hair and dog hair on it so i decided it was rinse it out under the sink and enjoy my  prime rib as the knicks were in the playoffs chester is that you what happened all i remember though is i 
[02:28:30]  was upstairs in the kitchen getting like uh some soda pop or something uh-huh and my uh i love how the  only pieces of this story get out at a time gotta put it together like a puzzle i guess that's right  that's why this uh show is so brilliant we make you listen longer with the this the soap opera so i  remember uh yeah the knicks were about to begin they were in the playoffs i had my prime rib dinner on  a little tv tray nice baked potato a little salad data a little little butter for the potato 
[02:29:00]  nice right perfect prime rib big game coming on like you know i i need  a refreshment sure you do so i went upstairs to get the uh the soda pop and uh yeah your mother-in-law  ex-mother-in-law all i remember her saying is why is chester down in the basement chester why are you in  the basement and opie's upstairs like oh my god just picturing his big juicy well we remember  you remember this dog begged all the time for food it was so obviously it smelled my prime rib and went 
[02:29:30]  down to the basement and that's the only part of the story i will be sharing today oh my goodness  but you know when you're up there and you're getting your little soda pop and my ex-mother-in-law  goes chester where are you why are you in the basement oh you must have right there just i had no oh my god  my my prime rib i had no doubt in my mind what was going on downstairs yeah it's not like the dog's  sitting there waiting for you to come down so we can ask if he could have some dogs just don't operate 
[02:30:00]  that way anyway back to the story so uh our listeners are out in the field and they're looking  for these live turkeys with their homemade uh weapons and um it says here in fhm magazine this  bamboozling plan lasted for less than five minutes before people saw the paper turkeys and said  what the f is this yes they did we were on our loudspeaker trying to explain yeah we were remember  because now we're realizing people are starting getting really pissed off in the field people 
[02:30:30]  please calm down uh you will get your turkeys return the paper turkeys uh to us and you will get gift  certificates for turkeys everyone wins right yeah we got t-shirts and everything else remember we had  all sorts of stuff screw you you guys are assholes so oh were they pissed uh yeah so yelling  yeah so we're on the loudspeaker trying to explain no it's okay you bring one back and you get a free  frozen turkey it's all good that wasn't good enough for these people nope and this is the gods on us  too they wanted uh they wanted to kill stuff all of a sudden it was like a mob mentality all of a sudden 
[02:31:00]  you see them kind of gathering in the field and they all start looking at at us broadcasting a  quarter mile away at the rock bus with our little headphones on thinking oh we're all just having fun  today and uh well they started running toward the rock bus this is a true story let's get them boys  there was uh a blood thirst that just wasn't satisfied so they all came charging back at us  we ran to batten down the hatches being the pussies that we really are we ran into the rock bus 
[02:31:30]  pussies dude it's a mob with improvised weaponry that woke up that morning with the reason and  expectation of killing something yeah with their bare hands or some improvised weapon remember it  was already snowing up there so there was like uh uh it was like yeah it was like ice yeah it was  kind of like ice balls yep it wasn't like a nice fluffy snow it was just it was just that you know  good packing ice type of snowball frigid winter in massachusetts oh so we're like holy ass and we jump 
[02:32:00]  into this huge rock bus this is so true man we ran to batten down the hatches and they began throwing  rocks and anything they could find including these like ice balls norton's laughing and we're still  like trying to like you know we're we're still screaming out the window as we're we're standing  up and the the rock bus had some big picture windows right in it especially in the back yeah so we were  kind of on the loudspeaker but they could see us through the windows and we're smiling like no it's 
[02:32:30]  cool everyone you know so we thought maybe just a few ice ice balls no no real damage done maybe a  couple rocks and we'll get the dents out whatever yeah right then they start taking their weapons  remember and start beating up the on the side of the bus with their improvised weapons so and we're  still trying i think the uh the loudspeaker or or through the windows i forget now uh and we're still  yelling you still got your turkeys you still got your turkeys but they didn't care  no and they continued then these efforts started breaking windows with their weapons of mass 
[02:33:00]  destruction and throwing the rocks breaking all the windows at the windows and then they started  rocking the bus remember that that's when we hit the deck yeah so yeah they were rocking the bus so  they could drag us out of it we were so scary we broadcasted from the floor remember under that table  yeah we're under this table thinking we're well protected and we continue our broadcast as uh the  quote staff it was otto our good our good pal otto was like calling the authorities to help us out 
[02:33:30]  because we weren't leaving this place without help yeah it was a mess they they wanted blood  they wanted to kill something or hurt something with the weapons they made and uh and since there  weren't any turkeys it was uh it was us right that was it go after the hosts of of the program that  sent them out there and we're broadcasting live and all all you hear is just slam slam against the 
[02:34:00]  rock bus awful and then um yeah this just ends in fhm magazine basically saying um these were our  hardened devoted fans and they want to kill something us that was the problem these were our  our faithful listeners and we pissed them off that bed listening to  uh don't forget the waf christmas party uh get your tickets now like obi still trying to read the 
[02:34:30]  liners and stuff uh coming up the new one from limp biscuit stick around oh jesus uh we'll be right back  don't go anywhere people you'll get your turkeys you're listening to the only station that really rocks  that was awful orange nine millimeter on the way the consummate professional and then of course our

[02:36:30]  yeah it was like a suburban a suburban right it was giant and he had like a he had like a rope  ladder just so he could climb into the thing he couldn't even get into it he couldn't get into i  don't think anyone ever saw him get in or out of it you just saw him in it right where he was really  up high he'd pull up next to your car look down hi boys look how tall i am in my vehicle  another career we ruined i think oh he had it made before he hired us yeah we kind of ruined it with  the mayor's dead thing everyone broke contacts with him that's what we do with these people 
[02:37:00]  they they spend their whole lives building up their career to get the respect and prestige and get the  respect of of politicians and people of power in media and they're able to go to parties and mingle  with these people and build their power base and actually use it to progress in their career well we  make their social lives oh yeah their social lives are a huge part of their brag that they were having  cocktails with mayor menino who i was with mayor menino at a fundraiser yesterday me and the mayor 
[02:37:30]  was speaking about blah blah blah well we make it so that they can no longer attend these events  because no one wants this embarrassing ass who hired us idiots at their parties make no mistake about it  we had a love hate relationship with bruce mittman yeah we really liked the guy and we also hated him  for some oh yeah it was just he didn't get the show he didn't get the vision we had he kind of got it 
[02:38:00]  he just wasn't willing to you know really see what it could do you know you know when liz wilde wanted to  talk i told her to shut up and play the music you boys are gonna have to learn the same thing yeah that's  gonna happen the best part when we did the mayor prank thing where we told all the boss that the mayor died in a fiery  car wreck for april fools yeah was uh when bruce mimmon tried to smooth things over and he hired a  photographer and he started uh stalking the mayor it's one of my favorite stories ever because he  wanted that shot of the mayor and him shaking hands or talking to each other uh to put it in 
[02:38:30]  the paper i gotta give him you know credit he he definitely tried to smooth things over and because  he thought that would help with if people saw him and the mayor in the paper they would be like oh i  guess they're you patch things up i could start inviting brucey over to my parties again and right  you know i invite him over to business ventures and then anything else right but he was stalking  the mayor with a cameraman he he found out uh you know the mayor's like press junket for that day like 
[02:39:00]  he's gonna be at the waldorf or what have you he's gonna be driving in dealey plaza today  i'll wait in the book depository boy he went down with us you know he didn't wimp out like uh dave dickless  oh dave dickless our program director who threw us under the bus first chance he got  bruce mittman went down with the ship big time big time i i gotta acknowledge that so uh so our  he was the general manager of the radio station and he's stalking the mayor and uh and he literally  hit in a bush with a photographer and then the mayor jumps out of wherever he was a restaurant 
[02:39:30]  i don't remember exactly you know he's doing some kind of stupid thing he's always around and  and then bruce mittman jumps out of the out of the bush boo and the photographer it was a pr firm  so the photographer's waiting and wait and then bruce runs up to him and basically shake his shakes  his hand like he's just some citizen on the street yeah not even saying who he is and then also the  photographer click click click click click and it made some rag up there him shaking the hand of the  mayor that'd be great to do if you're like some nazi organization just run up and take a picture of 
[02:40:00]  somebody right with a politician because if you jump out they'd just be smiling and oh how you  doing you know you're shaking hands you're both smiling take the picture yeah here he is with uh  a mobster so that was uh bruce's idea because we were the stars of the radio station he couldn't  afford to lose us at the time so he was trying everything to try to you know save us from getting  fired but we knew we were going to get fired for that thing and then stupid dave dickless with his uh  with his pie idea what and then his then then the cancer kids idea they were trying everything to 
[02:40:30]  try to get our image to be better than it was right because we were just dirt i mean think of the same  past thing we were it was pretty it was pretty similar the whole mood of the uh i still think the  mayor thing was worse than the st pat's thing yeah i mean in hindsight anthony in hindsight in hindsight  lighting the match they the people were pissed at us they were angry they saw no humor in it  because same situation so they were trying to get our image up one thing they wanted to do was to 
[02:41:00]  put us in dave dickless our program director who was just a spineless wormy ass wanted us to be put in  old timey stocks you know when they someone was bad in time in the central uh square they would they  would put you in the wooden stocks and have the mayor throw pies at our face this went so far that  they had bought the pies they bought hundreds hundreds of pies that were going to be hurled at 
[02:41:30]  our face and they don't even know how to buy the pies right because that old pie trick when you see  it on old tv and stuff yeah it's just it's just uh a pie tin whipped cream and whipped cream no they  bought real freaking real pies you know the real heavy kind with hundreds of pies this is before  they spoke to the mayor or before they spoke to us they had purchased all these pies they're trying  to get the mayor to go along with the mayor's office is just like we're not even entertaining  this no we get on the air when we got wind of it and said there is no way in hell we are ever 
[02:42:00]  going to have anyone throw pies at us we're not going to compromise ourselves yeah yeah we were all  uh dave dickless red face comes in pissed off as all hell you don't tell me what you're gonna do  or not do i'm your boss and you will do what i tell you that's exactly how he was screaming his  face is so red we're in shock he kind of had that hillary speech power oh yeah start off kind of calm  we'll do what i tell you screaming like mommy dearest no joke like the the male version 
[02:42:30]  tina mommy dearest get the pie tina it was a mess yeah they had gone through all this trouble uh  it wasn't going to work so plan b because we just knew it wasn't going to work  it's probably i've been doing radio a long time probably the stupidest idea even worse than  broadcasting live in front of the the world's largest pop tart anthony dude they would have 
[02:43:00]  had the the the the boston herald would have been opie and dopey fired like it was right but instead  of pictures of us in the studio there would have been pictures of us with pie on our face right like  it's the same end result we were out the door there was no way getting pies on our face was saving  us from this situation at least we look cool being yeah with our pictures on the front pages of boston  herald looking all fired like flipping the bird or something you know i think they had a picture  of you on the cover of the boston herald you and your stupid fire extinguisher oh brilliant what a 
[02:43:30]  great photo that was another another brilliant moment where it was like take the picture and don't get  any approval just put it out and not thinking that it would ever be used on the front page of a paper  it was oh it was awful awful but you know what that would have been both of us in stocks with  the pies in our face just dripping off our our faces they'd had some wacky little caption that  tied in the pies to us being fired that i'm not clever enough to think of right now opie and anthony 
[02:44:00]  hired oh there you go that's a good one hired oh so funny so we yeah we yelled back at dave i don't  do well when people yell at me no at all i don't think most people do but right it just brings me back  to a place i'd rather not visit so i just lose my mind so uh then they're like okay obviously they're  not gonna do that and but they're the stars of our radio station we still got to figure this out so 
[02:44:30]  that their uh plan b was to take the pies to a children's hospital this is their great plan b and  uh send that same photographer from the pr firm yeah the one that jumped out uh with brucey and uh  we would deliver the pies the hundred pies to uh the kids at this fine hospital and then we'd uh  we'd all get a photo op us with a pile of pies and a bunch of kids behind us and around us and  you know opie and anthony do a good thing for for the uh the cancer kids is what it turned out to be 
[02:45:00]  it was pretty much terminal ill ill terminally ill children so uh we're sitting there in the lobby  with all these pies on forklifts and honestly we were dazed and confused we were like what the hell  is going on you know we're kind of go i gotta admit we're sort of going with the idea at first well it  was all damage control it was all damage control and we were caught up in this whole whirlwind of trying to  save our jobs and trying to do what the station and the company said uh trying to keep our careers 
[02:45:30]  going so yeah we got caught up in this and we're listening to every idea that comes around even  though we weren't going to do the pie thing you know this was one of those things all right guys  you're supposed to be here at this uh such and such time with the pies go and uh a photographer  will be there we're like all right and then as we're sitting there in the waiting room and these  little terminally ill children are coming around they're coming they're coming from every hallway  and every doorway i mean just yeah every little nook and cranny they're coming from behind couches i 
[02:46:00]  mean they're just they're just gathering in the lobby for the big presentation of the pies it starts  occurring to opie and i that this is one of the scummiest things that has ever been concocted to try to  save someone's ass it was it was me and you and we it hit us at the same time we looked and it was like  do you feel good about this no not at all yeah this is the wrong so we're going to exploit this  situation and these kids to try to save our ass so anthony and i are definitely looking at each other 
[02:46:30]  like oh man this just this just is not adding up this isn't good and remember some of the kids had  it took like uh extra long time because they were barely functioning anymore and they were in  wheelchairs with oxygen it was horrible and uh and then just about everyone's there but remember  we had to wait for billy or whatever that guy's name was the kid who was just like just the worst  off and they had to have they had to have like three or four nurses uh that had to be with him at all 
[02:47:00]  times you know because just moving him from the room to the lobby was a really big deal remember  pretty risky move pretty risky move but it's worth it because he'll maybe he'll have a little  smile on his face when he sees the pile of pies it was it was uh i was gonna say it was it was the  christmas season and it wasn't obviously because we got fired in april but the reason why i'm thinking  it was uh the christmas season is also now billy's there and he's got his nurses around him making  sure you know reading all the meters on all his uh uh uh equipment that's keeping him alive oh and then 
[02:47:30]  all of a sudden uh one of the ladies in charge goes okay now we're gonna have a few sing-alongs  and then uh they started singing christmas carols christmas carols and uh now my goodness that's a  little out of place isn't it christmas carols it's it's spring right it's early spring christmas  carols it's springtime in boston right so then um what what was the song the girl sang the little  little like uh little silent night it was silent night of course it was like uh it was cindy who from 
[02:48:00]  whoville basically cindy who from whoville it was basically cindy yeah she was beautiful beautiful  little blonde child and she's singing silent night and needed was a little cowboy hat and six shooters  by her side those little boots and a garret around her neck jesus so then  all right jimmy calm down jesus  so then uh she's singing a beautiful rendition of silent night 
[02:48:30]  i'm trying to hurry up because we have to take two breaks an hour and it's uh it's not working  out too well this hour all right we're gonna have to like break come back for two minutes and break  again i guess so then uh she's singing silent night yeah and one of the nurse ladies like kind of leans  over to me and she goes you know what i go what you see cindy uh singing that i'm like yeah real nice  you know i could appreciate some nice singing right she goes she's not gonna make it to this christmas  she won't see christmas that's why they were singing christmas song right because they weren't

[03:05:00]  there that messed up the whole flow  yes it did  we're having a good time today right  goodness  we got the uh we got the hooker thing we're going to get to in a little bit  what a what a nice little story that is  uh a little local angle with long island us growing up there kind of  understand what these little places are about  i don't know if they have them in many other places do they you've been around  the hot dog like um it's the hot dog truck  the hot dog trucks they're they're these trucks that are either  like old-time delivery trucks they look like with like a little window and 
[03:05:30]  shelf cut in on the side so you could sell stuff out of it  or sometimes they use motor uh little motor homes or campers on the back of  pickup trucks that's an ice cream truck that's there you go  serves hot dogs like an ice cream truck and sodas that's it  and and you get up there and you get a couple of hot dogs  bun you know a little mustard relish whatever you want on it you want to get  dean in for this story as we're sure moving in

[03:06:30]  usually about now he starts his farting so some things never change yeah i cut a lot  of gas good stuff good stuff yeah no the nine o'clock hour is uh  reserved for jimmy's farting and then and then we comment about it and we uh  spray down his ass with the lysol that's all we do in the nine o'clock hour every day  yes oh he totally enjoys us losing our minds over his uh his his gassers  he'll smile and not say a word until somebody just starts gagging silent cat yeah like me oh he  just starts giggling that's a comedious dude that's our thing he farts it doesn't make a noise and 
[03:07:00]  he just starts like moving his whole body as he's giggling and waiting for us to enjoy what he  has to offer and the best is when this big kevin's in here and he has no sense of smell but he still  like waves it in front of his face just to be one of the guys yeah you can't smell it you sociopath  you have no sense of smell does he really do that yeah but he'll go yuck and i'll be like  what are you looking for a little hope for an exercise regiment that's classic well dean you were you  were on snl and i loved you on there what happened hey man you know what they uh you got any dirt or 
[03:07:30]  you don't want to yeah well every snl guy has dirt man we've talked to a few guys i'm gonna keep it  real i was trying to get like all of the females pregnant at the same time is that it and lauren wasn't  going for it so you know no we need a new negro in here we can't do dean any no it was you know what  it was and jim i i i like every everybody else talking about it but like it wasn't it wasn't a  good fit like i did everything i could you know to uh to to shine and anybody that sees me on stage 
[03:08:00]  you know constantly people are still so i you know how did you do all these impressions all these  characters and like man you have to it's it's a political place as well so you have to know how to  maneuver that's what we've heard it's really hard to get one of your fists on yeah and uh brewer and  i speak all the time and and you know we we just did a gig uh two months ago and we sat for like  an hour before the show just trading like war stories because you know snl is really you're in 
[03:08:30]  the foxhole and you're going to war every week trying to get your stuff on and and jim was like  you know dean you know what happened you you went in i bet i bet you were nice and you're cheering  everybody on and you know you're trying to be be as a team player i said yeah and he said  that's not gonna work you know because you got you have to go in with you with your guns loaded and  and i remember tracy you know tracy morgan was like dean listen you gotta you got to you got to 
[03:09:00]  you got to do your do your own thing let them know you're there let them know that you're a team  player but you got to go for broke you got to let them know you flying high over the stratosphere  you over la guardia sky high it's awesome you know and and tracy you know he took me under his  under his wing and i appreciate because you know oftentimes you know people try to create well  especially in the clubs jim saw like everybody's like you know and now that you're there tracy's 
[03:09:30]  and i'm like nah tracy you know he did he did what he could he took me to dinner when i first started  and uh and he you know he told me this is the last time i'm gonna do this you know but i'm 10 and he  told me you know watch out for this landmine and that landmine and uh just just stay focused  and and then i had like you know from rock chris rock to sandler to brew you know the stand-ups  because that's another thing i came from the stand-up world as opposed to the sketch comedy world i  wasn't a groundling or ucb or second city and that you know you had writers that were already there 
[03:10:00]  so if say i came from second city you already had like three or four writers from second city  or if i came from the groundlings i had like two or three cast members and like one or two writers  so you already had a support base you're kind of in the fold there you might get a little  preferential treatment or something exactly you come as a stand stand-ups are jackals we're the  bastards of the comedy world or the entertainment world and they're like you know just throw them in  there hopefully they'll do we're like we're the uh lone shooters when when we go into the um the 
[03:10:30]  police force you know it's hard to partner us up and i was willing to work with everybody but it was  just a matter of um getting shining my first year i did really well tracy said you know you gotta get  you got you need two shows to justify your existence you need at least two hot shows and i had like four  my first season so i was like oh this is awesome i got this you know second season it was it was uh i  think had to do with it was tracy's final season he was he come come into being one of the main stars of the 
[03:11:00]  show and so when writers are writing for you they're saying all right well are we gonna write  for uh upstart black guy or you know the star but unfortunately that's that institutionalized  foolishness where they're saying well we can't we can't use two black guys and that's that's too much  negro at one time you know and you know unfortunately so you're saying all right and and i'm a team  player so i'm like all right well you know what at least tracy's getting some love and if i can get in 
[03:11:30]  something you know and oftentimes at the end of a show my stuff my stuff got relegated like um  bernie mack was was on my final season and uh we had this sketch where bernie was playing he did  like a solid sydney portier and i was doing denzel washington right after the oscars and uh the sketch  the sketch went we we blocked the show a lot of people don't understand how the show works like we we  do the show we do like the dress rehearsal show on saturday evening at eight with live crowd taped 
[03:12:00]  right which is which is taped which is cool because even if your stuff doesn't make the air you still  have this you still have proof you know um and then at about 10 30 10 45 you have a meeting where  you go in you look on the board you see where your sketch is laid and hopefully it's not to the side off  the show so my my sketch is uh last and there's a sketch that i'm in that tina fey wrote that second  to last so after after the um meeting we go down i'm sitting with tracy and uh i'm i'm sitting there  like well you know i just hope i can get my denzel on and and they have the times blocked out and and 
[03:12:30]  tracy's like tina tina's sketch is three minutes 30 seconds yours is four and a half minutes your  shit's getting cut i'm like i think so and so at 12 48 you know 12 minutes before the show i'm in the makeup  and you you hear a message from stage manager uh denzel washington uh has been cut we're going  right to bt house and and and you got roll with it and after you know we're walking out for good 
[03:13:00]  nights and bernie's like don't worry you i got something for you so i'm like you're gonna take  me on the road or something you know and um and i guess what keeps me going is i'm like you know what  i had cash from bernie mack to ollie laroy was writing who um he had written uh head of state and they  all like yo you got it you have nothing to worry about you know and i'm a comedian first you know  so even even if snl snl is not a final final place you you're gonna be you go there you do  your two years and you move on why do they never seem to know how to use black performers i mean 
[03:13:30]  whenever it's always there with eddie murphy it seemed like that was like a great chance to let  a guy shine yeah but it seems like they really chris rock's a great example yeah i mean he he blew up  after yes yes he so blew up after snl they did not use him at all i couldn't believe it was the  same guy i'm like man is this guy funny but uh he just i don't know except for a couple skits yeah  well yeah he never shined in that you know and and and didn't he warn you though or tell you that  well chris yeah he i mean my first season chris chris came into the comedy cellar you know the 
[03:14:00]  watering hole all the comics is hanging out down there love that place and um i'm excited because in in  my mind i'm like if i'm if i'm on the air i'm good you know i'm feeling happy because because  it's a mind screw because you're sitting around and you don't want to be you don't want to be in  your dressing room with people walking by ignoring like not looking at you like oh geez he's sitting  in there miserable you know because that's what happens so you're happy just to be in the show we  had jack black on the week before uh the saturday before i'm i'm in like four sketches not really being 
[03:14:30]  used but i'm there monday chris comes into the cellar we're all hanging out uh chris was i i never  watched that show the one time i watched it they still don't use black people you know and i'm like  chris you know i uh i was in four uh sketches this week he was like you weren't in them yeah you were  there but you weren't really in them they use you and he taught me a lesson he said you know he said  he said don't ever be happy just for somebody throw you a bone he said people that don't have 
[03:15:00]  talent are happy just being thrown in stuff he said you got talent he says some fight fight for  everything you do up there even if you don't get get the stuff on there at least you can say i did  everything i could you know so write two sketches and update quinn saying do you write two sketches  update sandler two two sketching up so every week i was going in on sundays you know just just to  sort of get a jump um ahead of everyone and say going with like um my friend tylin and mark 
[03:15:30]  theobo two other comedians and we would just sit in there for a couple of hours so that by the time  a host came in i had something you know on the books that i said okay i started working on this  only problem with that is that you know people want to be in on on it from the beginning so now right  like wow he already wrote that he didn't need my help you know so it's it's like a catch 20 it's it  is is and and lawrence stories over and over again by everyone that was at snl man that's a 
[03:16:00]  rough place but it's it's you know what it's the the trick is saying you know what this is not my  final destination and i never i never i'll never allow so if i'm i'm on stage if i if i get those  those hundred people or those thousand people five if i get all those people living i'm proven i know  that i got the good so i never i you know one of my friends um i have a question for you did chris  mention when he was giving advice out like not to be a brilliant stand-up comedian and then do like 
[03:16:30]  movies like head of state and putty tang he's a brilliant act but jesus christ does make the  flintstones look comedically you got you got you got to start small and work your way up right  oh that's why i say in case chris is listening i ain't giving him advice ever again i was gonna  put him in a movie but now strong i ain't putting him in yet you know you do brilliant impressions i 
[03:17:00]  mean he wanted the best and how do they not use that on saturday night live it's mind-boggling to me  is you know is is that politics the political because i'm not i'm man let's hear some of the voices  man who do you do real well i mean the chris rock is right on tracy morgan's right on again we we do  a bit of denzel you know uh do a little bit of denzel me and man suppose we were out there talking  about uh if you we we do a little bit of denzel uh you know uh erica bad 
[03:17:30]  erica badu you can tell jim does not listen to uh does nothing hip-hop r&b  he just listens to ozzy that's it ozzy and johnny cash she's one of the biggest stars  doesn't she sound like uh james don't know um yeah some man anybody if i'm around you long enough 
[03:18:00]  uh yeah you know and i like your voice you know i just watch you long enough and uh he's looking  around the room look around at you guys you know who were the who are some of the like big characters  on snl when you were on like what were they really pushing like every week um show up that's like i  said tracy was popping with brian fellows brian fellow i'm brian fellow that is hysterical i love  brian that was a good and astronaut jones yeah you know that was the banger um why wouldn't he let you  do the sketch he wanted to do a sketch with him and tracy where you were acting as tracy yeah well 
[03:18:30]  you know what that would have been great yeah you know what that was uh the the writer i said uh  brilliant writer max brooks um he uh he was my writing partner and max was like you know what what  if we did like tracy morgan like like sort of terminator you know with like the new improved tracy  morgan yeah but you know i don't think who wants somebody to say this is the new improved me you  know and i think that's what happened i think tracy kind of was like no no i don't want dean coming 
[03:19:00]  and doing me better than me you know yeah i mean you know it's it was it was good on but i love i  was like hey man i'll do whatever y'all yeah you know but they they kind of you know knocked the feet  up from from under that one before we got it popping how do they give you the boot there on snl  they well you know they don't they don't give you the boot they just hit you with um yeah well you  you you get a call out and fortunately i was on a film set so it didn't really hit me hard i was  you know uh my agent calls and and they were like uh they were like yeah you know dean your contract 
[03:19:30]  got renewed or did it came time in july for your contract renewal they didn't renew it so they they  do it that way so you say well well i didn't get fired i i left you know yeah i just chose not to  because sometimes like one one of my friends um jeff richards drunk girl who was like had  jeff will you ask like what what characters jeff came in and drunk girl was like on fire yeah i 
[03:20:00]  loved it and i was wondering what happened yeah from from what i understand they just midway through the  season for whatever reason they just that's fired when they just say midway through the season yeah you  know what um you're still under contract and we'll pay you but holy what did he do and and i wasn't  there at the time so i don't know what happened but once again it was that jeff was a stand-up you  know so he he wasn't aligned with um with people correctly to where he had people fighting for him 
[03:20:30]  the writers do have a problem those sketch writers who are with guys like you upright citizens they have  this weird thing with stand-ups because because stand-ups do what they can't do it's like those sketch  guys and the writers they really need each other right because they're both kind of like half  talents you know like you know tough but none of the balls just to stand up there so they have like  this weird resentment towards stand-up yeah yeah yeah and you get you you get that a lot and i was the  cat that was looking at his head full so i was like well he doesn't not like me he just doesn't want to 
[03:21:00]  talk to me you know and uh and i killed everybody with kindness i was walking around always going  knocking on people's doors and saying yo what's up and also there were no there were no black writers  in my first year you know you can't you can't tell people here this is you know right for this and  the only the only contact they've had some people might have had with black cat is he's uh you know  a cop or janitor because that's what they're gonna write you know and then you're gonna be the dude in  the background that's sweeping trying to trying to look in the camera so your mother says there's my 
[03:21:30]  baby you know get some face time yeah you know and and that's and and oftentimes tracy said he said  if if you're not in the show they're gonna use you for language where they write something  where someone's playing a hip character so you'll get a that knock on your office what's a what's a  way to say yeah or for sure you know for sizzle brilliant brilliant i'm gonna use that could  could i get in that's because yeah i don't have a janitor this you know and that's that's the natural 
[03:22:00]  uh state of things you know you roll with it you you know you say and and i remember tracy said uh  eddie murphy came to the show one time he was doing rosie o'donnell which taped down the hallway  and uh and eddie um after he taped rosie came in they were blocking the scene and um tracy's sitting  there and eddie leans over to tracing he says i know you're miserable and walked out  and and so 20 years ago you know things haven't changed and i think eddie popped a because he's 
[03:22:30]  you know phenomenally talented and b because they were going through um a period where they didn't  know um what really was going on they they had gone through like two different uh producers yeah and  the cast you know and the cast yeah you know and that's what ebersole was there yeah well that was  actually before they had uh that woman yeah you know and then ebersole came in saw eddie do something  that popped and and uh he said you know we need to focus more uh more time on on it on him is that 
[03:23:00]  why murphy didn't come back for like that big 20th anniversary snl had he was like noticeably absent  from this well you know what i i i heard yeah i heard one of the reasons like eddie got kind of pissed  with the show because um you know during the 90s when he was doing like uh like vampire in brooklyn  you know something i'm sure you have on dvd yeah yeah you know that and metro  he shot that in front of blockbuster to cut down on shipping costs  wow that's a good one 
[03:23:30]  they um i guess you know uh spade used to do the hollywood minute and so one time they um spade  was doing and they showed murphy and uh he said look kids a falling star and i heard eddie didn't  like that because eddie really saved the show yeah because the show was on the verge of getting totally  canceled um right before he popped and you know once he popped it it became you know must see viewing 
[03:24:00]  before they even called tv must see tv and he saved the show so i think he probably felt a little  slighted hell yeah you know by the time there was time they were like you know yeah we're having this  25th anniversary and you know we were just kidding with you at you know he's like yeah whatever i don't  need you you know i made 20 million you know and kept it moving you know and uh and so i you know  and this is the 30 years so i wonder if you'll uh it's been 30 years man so i don't watch the show  anymore anymore i'm not home i'm not home well it's kind of probably be a little rough too you 
[03:24:30]  know yeah yeah probably yeah you don't want to listen we didn't want to listen to radio oh really  we got whatever you're off of whatever medium you want to be doing you just don't listen to it  it's depressing yeah yeah yeah that's true don't bang a chick you don't run over and push her  new boyfriend's cheeks isn't she terrific  yeah yeah man so i i haven't i'm not home on saturday nights for one to to come out on stage 
[03:25:00]  but b it's like i'm like yeah i don't know if i feel because you're gonna if you it's almost like  a retired boxer uh-huh if you're watching a you know a match and you're oh they should have done  this oh they could have yeah on a meal with that joker why is this going they can't just watch it  anymore yeah yeah it's not going to be the same because you're gonna you think it's good  do you think they're going this ain't funny this sucks hey that's that's maybe that's why i don't  watch it so i don't have to answer that question you know how much you only got to know on the show  daryl the only friend left on that show daryl daryl and and i don't even know if um daryl's getting 
[03:25:30]  the light that uh i mean this is i think it's 10th season and that's that's i guess what used to  frustrate me because i'm like this person is one of the stars of the show uh use them you know  tracy's one of the stars of the show don't have him in just the stuff the black guy uh stuff you  know um i really think they try uh i think lauren tries to keep anybody from really being the standout  because once they are they leave right you know go on their own and uh i i think i i think i read 
[03:26:00]  and he even acknowledged that that he tries to keep people in check so they don't they don't leave  well yeah because that's what happened in the early years yeah he was after chevy it was a machine  man it was a star making machine yeah yeah tim meadow oh oh i liked him but yeah no tim actually you  know it's you know what i'm gonna defend him only because tim actually has had a decent career  considering he still works you know true he was in like two movies last year and that's the truth 
[03:26:30]  i think i think does come in a drink saying he's don cheetle oh i loved you in boogie night  sound thank you might have been funny if my headphones didn't fall off and choke you the  mock drinking but tim you know what happened that when when the first the first group of cats blew up  over the show then you have that to that hype sort of to live up to and even even again like tim  kazerinsky you know who people oh my god hey who is that exactly now yeah he was on he he came on 
[03:27:00]  when when eddie and piscopo were on but he did they did like eight police academies now that's not right  that's not something to say you know i'm brilliant actor but he stayed working you know i mean so it's  like once once you get that snl label on you it's like you know you're proven and people say all right  you know what after you he's done he survived the marine corps so he can do anything you know and  and even people that haven't done i mean stiller only lasted a year you know ben still damon wayne's 
[03:27:30]  lasted six months there are some people that you see him as saturday night live alumni right right  what the i don't remember sarah silverman yeah silverman yeah david tell wrote this for jay moore  you know yeah he used to run out and do spots and drink and stuff and i think attell just kind  of blew it there you know he was a maniac yeah that's the structure of tell is a cycle  blah blah blue blue they're hebert high-rooted unshaven because he's been binge drinking for four 
[03:28:00]  days tell is amazing guy ellen cleghorn was on ellen ellen had had some success too because she had  that uh that ghetto character that ghetto page character and um and wound up getting a sitcom on  uh wb or you you wouldn't see if you don't know erika badu i know you never saw that show  no i didn't even know ellen was on this yeah somebody told me yeah she had a sitcom first  year one year one year on no she did three no she was there wow yeah she did a uh really good robin 
[03:28:30]  quivers yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah she did robin she did uh whoopee you know it's funny i didn't  even i didn't watch the show um until i i got on it until like this the summer i booked it i said all  right let me do some homework and so i started watching because like i said i'm a stand-up so i was out  on on the weekends when the show was airing for the last decade and that's why i was like oh i  didn't know ellen i saw her in deaf comedy damn i didn't know she was on uh snl you know yeah a  lot of cats a lot of cats signed more outside of the show like a chris rocker and as and chris said 
[03:29:00]  that um after uh i saw him at the laugh factory in la because he thought he was like at our season  rap party my final year we were talking he was like you'll be back they ain't crazy you'll be back and  that's how everybody was like dean you you you have you have the skills you're gonna be back so  i saw him uh at the factory and he's like he's he said something i was like oh yeah i didn't get  renewed and he he's kind of like are you he's like he's like well you know what i ain't do well then 
[03:29:30]  damon didn't do well then you'll be all right you know and and it's true because it's like i look i  i look at somebody like him that's he he after the show didn't work out he said you know what let me go  back to the foundation and get in those clubs you know so that's why you see me back in the clubs  working my honing honing my you know skills saying hi you know because this was not the the end you  know for your listeners out there you know i had probably like four fans you know that were religious 
[03:30:00]  like dean is funny and he's and they were they were all like one one was probably a little like  kid that was nine years old you know sending fan letters and whatnot i got a question for you about snl  dude this is something i wanted to ask why is nobody i never saw anybody break the fourth wall  there like if a sketch is bombing like as a comedian you go like jesus that blower weird stink we'll say  it right how come nobody does lauren like threaten you with death for that no you just now that's funny  there's an snl commercial on the television right now this is karma there's karma right there um 
[03:30:30]  now you know what i think there was just that that you didn't want to i know for me i was i was the new  nigg so i was like i ain't i ain't doing nothing to to to make somebody say why why is he looking at the  camera yeah he's supposed to be you know so really sounds like that boring lauren i met him one time  when you guys were doing the college we did we got a picture live no i didn't actually i should have but 
[03:31:00]  i didn't uh i did live to you rosie i was too nervous and um yeah he really is like it's like it's like  like jesus dude you really are a dull they have been they have been laughing a lot more lately i  think jimmy fallon started a lot of that where you oh yeah yeah yeah just start breaking yeah jimmy  and horatio laughing yeah they they kind of started that like carby corman yeah yeah tim conway  yeah yeah that's now on uh calabernet yeah what did jimmy what do you think jimmy fallon leaving good  move yes i think it was like jimmy said he was only going to do like four or five years so i think 
[03:31:30]  he really i think he did five bounce before you know he really left on top yeah bounce on top  that's that's the best thing to do uh will i did one year with will ferrell will left right when he  was supposed to man went into went into old school and yeah but then you get a sherry or terry who  leaves and drops off the face of the earth well you know what the hell happened there sherry had like  i think she had a deal with uh cbs and that's and that's i guess i was in the same situation because  it's like you leave and you say that's all right i'm gonna prove them wrong and and i had buzz before 
[03:32:00]  i got there went to montreal had networks interested in giving me a deal so after i left went when my  agent called and was like you're not renewed i said i will call all of those networks that were  interested before call them tell them i'm gonna come out to la next month and i left la with a deal  with abc so i'm like i don't need i said i don't need anyone i i'm making money and i have a show coming  out and then you find out like they had six other black cats at abc with with deals and you're like 
[03:32:30]  all right well hopefully i'm i'm the one they decide to produce and none of us wound up uh you know  getting our shows picked up or getting cast on anything so like all right well go back to the  clubs that's funny maybe you could just jimmy did some really good film with queen latifah that was  supposedly um oh i i wouldn't i know you're friends with him and i i like jimmy too i know him and he's a  very nice guy and it was supposedly a very funny film um oh i didn't i didn't catch it

[03:40:30]  god but yeah it was it was uh it was it was once it was a mind screw but hey we gotta get to the  prostitute story or our listeners are gonna kill us today oh did you hear about this no no no this is  actually pretty i don't read disgusting it's kind of where are you involved in this no but i like it  already it's kind of it's very happy with it's kind of funny it kind of would it it's almost hot  if you didn't think what these women probably look like and and smelt like what picture one of the 
[03:41:00]  women did they yes what paper uh i don't know poster daily news she didn't look that bad at all  really she didn't look bad right especially for long island anthony especially that's all  i was a long island yeah yeah oh those are the best i'm just picturing some long island whore  bags sitting big hair yeah huge hair the 80s shoulder pad dress they're not out of the 80s  don't wash yeah don't wash don't wash stong on still in fashion on long island yeah it's very hot  actually i just read the story this is very you like it yeah i think it is too in a way 
[03:41:30]  my sexual addiction the inappropriate yeah this is what is it what is it like what's this what's the  story uh let's see uh customers at a baldwin hot dog stand got more than just sauerkraut with  their franks oh brilliant the story funny nassau police said yesterday after arresting the two  women who ran the business on charges of offering up sexual services along with their hot dogs and  sodas police began watching the hot dog stand which was run out of a camper on the property of a former 
[03:42:00]  restaurant these things are they're all over long island like if you're from long island you worked  on long island you see them all over there on the side of the you know main roads and stuff  the like an ice cream truck kind of type thing or a motorhome a camper on a pickup and it's just  some slob that looks like they bought hot dogs down at wall bombs i don't know how they're cooking  them what they're making how long they've been sitting there what they're serving them on but  people in droves go to these things and buy this crap there's no health inspector license or something  these people are just selling crap out of their truck and people buy it and people buy it and now it 
[03:42:30]  turns out a couple of women were arrested because uh let's see as uh scalia one of the women were  preparing this guy's food who turned out to be a cop she offered to expose her breasts to him for money  her name was scalia uh scalia was one of the women and scourge was the other school now do you  how far as do you want someone serving you a hot dog named scourge scourge or scalia sounds like a 
[03:43:00]  disease that's what you'll get scalia and scourge then uh offer the officer oral sex in exchange for  money oh well you know the two that uh said they're they had a stripper business called body talk and  gave him a business card they were arrested promptly and given an appearance ticket but now you're thinking  all right prostitution out of that but they were serving these hot dogs to people you know i'm sure 
[03:43:30]  they didn't put gloves on no and i'm sure they didn't suck those those uh guys off without their  hands they're not look i'll do this with no hands you know they're handling sauerkraut that you were  eating with your hot exactly a little you know this is a great cop cube are there hot are there onions  on my hot dog oh no i was tickling the bag of another fella it just smells like that  it's disgusting right to the sauerkraut and onion joke scalia's number is 555 so jimmy why do you 
[03:44:00]  think why do you think the story's hot because it's inappropriate it's it's the timing of it it's  it's to be in one place and to have another reality put in your face yeah like to be buying a hot dog  and have someone to offer you something sexual i wouldn't care hanging her tits what she looked like  yeah i would be very turned on by that as long as she wasn't completely atrocious  and i guess it was going on inside this motor home yeah the camper just an awful dirty so so  could you not see that i mean do you not notice that the camper is bouncing while you're rocking 
[03:44:30]  relish on your your hot dog or jackie gleason comes over and says next time put your badge on your dick  this camper's rocking don't come knock worstin no i knew it was gonna bomb i did it on purpose stop it  did i really no you know what's funny is that one of the hookers was eating a hot dog and it  bounced out of the trailer and into the mouth of a hippopotamus an old guy do i bring nothing  yeah jimmy brought a very awkward story today to the program oh did you bring that i thought i 
[03:45:00]  thought i brought us no not this one but another story i thought it was real and i'm like i bring  in a story jimmy really real you're the one that they caught oh no i would be scalia i've never  been jimmy obviously very funny adds lots of program but but he he doesn't bring in a lot of  stuff that we can work with very lazy okay very lazy but when he does brought in a nice story about  a uh a midget or dwarf a dwarf who was eaten by a hippopotamus so i'm like all right this dwarf was  probably bathing in some river somewhere and got eaten by a hippo or something maybe it was doing its 
[03:45:30]  laundry and the amazon maybe so i don't know but then it turns out this midget was a clown type midget in  the circus and it was jumping on a trampoline and bounced bounced off the side into a yawning  hippopotamus's mouth who then the gag reflex of the hippo made it swallow and it swallowed the uh  the dwarf whole did he die uh i don't know did he because they could have just reached in and pulled 
[03:46:00]  out pull it out or cut the hippo open nobody would risk losing their arm especially to rescue  what amounts to a half a person oh why yeah why kill a perfectly good hippopotamus for a  dwarf even in god's eyes it doesn't really count as much  awful person wow but then we pop it up on snopes.com which dispels all urban legends and of course it  pops up as an urban legend and people are complaining that they read it in like the weekly world news back  in 86 so jimmy's bringing some real topical current material somebody emailed it to me and like a 
[03:46:30]  retard i just was like wow that's kind of a funny story like just thinking that a midget was killed  right which is always funny regardless of circumstance i like the eight millimeter  film you brought in of you uh riding a horse and falling off and then showing bigfoot walking in  the woods that was good and that photo of nessie you took in scotland that's right i'm a surgeon  surgeon's photo that's what it is yes a little too much uh information that you knew that everyone  else didn't confessed on his deathbed by the way that it was a hoax and then he had done it with an 
[03:47:00]  upside down like wooden ship and that was the bottom of it oh really yes confessed on his deathbed  all right you should go on jeopardy tournament of champions i really should you're smart jimmy  you're so smart you can catch age if you sleep with a lot of prostitutes without a condom  wrong alex no you can't i'm still standing jim loves hookers i love it oh man i live vicariously through  jim he has a story every single day you went to you went to rio too three times oh wow they're 
[03:47:30]  trying to corrupt me him and patrice o'neill are trying to get trees is another go down  oh patrice is a filth bad carball yeah patrice bought i saw patrice last night he bought we have  to he'll come in and explain what it is a sex swing this lonely disconnected psychopath bought a  sex swing that thing we saw on the video type he bought one and it's hanging in his apartment  wow what the hell so a girl comes in she knows what she's getting herself into hopefully a girl i hope  he's not a pedophile and he just wants a swing with easy access look it's a seesaw with little 
[03:48:00]  dildos on it very healthy that's connected to where do you get something like that i don't know  that's not like something you order catalog online yeah but that seems like something you order online  that they never send and you can't you don't want to bring you can't complain if the money's missing  right right that's something you should keep in the closet though he has it out all the time  probably not but i'm guessing if you look up you're going to see like a metal hook  yeah yeah something goes on something what's that for something that's disconnected  like he's kind of a big guy and i didn't get it like you know where you hang up and it's just 
[03:48:30]  sucking ass i know it's funny and i'm trying just i we're playing bomb ping pong here jimmy  oh i realized it's your turn swing away at nothing i act dude i actually have a muscle pull  in the back of my right side from swinging so hard at one before yeah you really did bomb earlier 
[03:49:00]  hopefully you covered up for the three i've done since that's all right i'm waiting for one  one's gonna stick i'm gonna throw out some that stinks i don't know this do you know who he is  i don't know what i'm wondering why stephen king is someone in here just snapping pictures off of  all i didn't notice but people who shined oh yeah that's where the crickets like all right wow  stephen king wrote the shining yeah yeah these pictures are for vegas i think no reason right
