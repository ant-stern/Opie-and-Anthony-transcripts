<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a humorous, superhero-themed intro, featuring in-studio guest Jimmy Norton.  The discussion quickly devolved into a conversation about the flatulence-inducing effects of various breakfast cereals, particularly Raisin Bran.  A change in the show's opening music ("Ecstasy of Gold") was then addressed, with Opie expressing a desire for more variety.

A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to the death of Don's wife from the rival "Don and Mikey" show.  Opie and Anthony explained their decision not to make jokes about the situation, acknowledging the resulting listener backlash and accusations of hypocrisy.  They defended their position, emphasizing that their restraint stemmed from empathy and common sense, not a strict rule.  Personal experiences with loss were shared, fostering a connection with listeners. The conversation broadened to explore the boundaries of humor and the importance of respectful online discourse.

The show then transitioned to a prolonged critique of XM Satellite Radio's lack of marketing support for the Opie and Anthony show, highlighting the underutilization of their promotional van and the absence of a street team.  Frustration with unfulfilled promises from XM's marketing department was expressed, along with descriptions of their own attempts to rectify the situation.  This segment also included a discussion on the popularity of reality TV shows, specifically *Survivor* and *Big Brother*, with opinions on *Celebrity Fit Club*, *The Surreal Life*, and Gary Busey's antics.  The hosts recounted an incident where Anthony's brother submitted parody songs to Howard Stern's show, nearly resulting in their firing, and discussed Imus's reaction and a lawsuit against him by a doctor, touching upon the difficulties faced by doctors due to lawsuits. A listener called in, highlighting the show's complex storylines and internal slang, including a running gag involving a yogurt lid named Liddy. This section also included playing audio clips, including XMTV outtakes and a six-minute parody song by Anthony's brother, and discussions on fashion trends like low-rise jeans and changing preferences for women's body hair. A call from Bruce Kelly, marked by his emotional reaction to The Who at Live 8, further punctuated this segment.

Another segment focused on Air America and XM Satellite Radio, followed by a prank call segment where a caller, described as a ".5 fan" of Donna Summer, won tickets, a Vegas weekend, and a jokingly promised space shuttle trip. The hosts discussed Madonna snubbing Bruce Kelly at Live 8, playing a clip of Kelly's awkward appearance.  A Howard Beach assault case, where the victim was later revealed to have been arrested for armed robbery, led to a discussion about hate crimes.  A news story about a wife acquitted of manslaughter after stabbing her husband over a disagreement about her butt size was discussed, transitioning into more commentary on reality TV, specifically Hulk Hogan's *Hogan Knows Best*, and its perceived fakeness.  Technical difficulties with Hulk Hogan audio clips resulted in a memorable outburst and departure from the studio by staff member Bernie. The BBC's decision to avoid using the word "terrorist" in its reporting of the London bombings sparked a debate on political correctness and the war on terror.  More technical issues, listener calls, and further discussion of the BBC's reporting and Hulk Hogan audio marked the end of this section.

A significant portion of the show featured clips and discussion of *Hogan Knows Best*, focusing on Hulk Hogan's interactions with his daughter Brooke's 22-year-old date, Adam. The hosts criticized the show's acting and excessive dramatic music.  The conversation included discussions of Adam's sexual activity, AIDS testing, and body piercings. A listener debated the definition of terrorism, followed by more analysis of Hogan's overprotective behavior. A caller shared a similar anecdote. Brooke Hogan's song was played and critiqued.  A phone call with Jay Moore followed, discussing various reality shows, Bobby Brown's behavior, an international home run derby, and Photoshop.  CNBC anchor Ted David joined the show for a discussion about his career, music identification, the stock market, and CNBC personalities. The show concluded with a discussion of Beau Bridges, who was in studio promoting *Stargate SG-1*, reminiscing about his earlier career and his brother Jeff Bridges.

The final segment included an interview with Beau Bridges, covering his career, anecdotes about working with his father Lloyd Bridges and Richard Pryor, his acting style, views on Hollywood remakes, and musical interests.  The show then shifted to a discussion of a television segment they were producing, playing audio clips of Jim Norton arguing with a caller. Edited versions of these clips were played, demonstrating how profanity was altered for television.  The process of cleaning up the audio was detailed, including numerous vulgar jokes about Jim Norton and his mother. A CNBC anchor and his son were briefly mentioned as being in the studio. The segment concluded with promotional information for upcoming events.  Throughout the entire broadcast, numerous fart jokes and crude humor were prevalent.

[00:00:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you very much.  To fight the forces of evil. 
[00:03:30]  The Obi and Anthony Show.  Oh my sweet Jesus.  With A-Cup.  I want to be known as Notorious.  No.  A-C-A-C.  Everyone is always in my way.  Oh, you really are deluded.  And B-Cup.  Kind of fat-breasted and awful.  And surrounded by dullards.  Ben looks like poorly spliced.  Oh, it's hilarious.  Oh, it's hilarious.  I've never seen yawns.  It looks like the back of the Batmobile and it looks so like...  Oh, ketosis.  Eric, you're not going to cry.  Shut up.  And armed with superhuman powers. 
[00:04:00]  He holds his pants down and just starts leaking into someone's garbage shed.  That's rule one.  How about if he gives you the old chin tap with his helmet?  That's all right with me.  They are living among us.  Average citizens.  Average heroes.  Quietly and anonymously continuing to make the world a better place.  Controversial talkers Opie and Anthony.  We are just...  You better just sit back and watch.  Yeah.  Wait, what?  The Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:04:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  Now, save your breath and cure your heart.  Hey, look.  What the heck do you live like?  Uh, the Scottish Oxfam furniture.  And, uh, Scott, of course, with, uh, Matt and Chuck, I call it.  Yeah.  Right.  It's a terrible pause for somebody who's blue, but...  Hello.  Fuck face.  Arrgh!  Are you right?  Are you right?  Are you right?  Ooh.  Ooh. 
[00:05:00]  I'm sorry.  I'm absolutely crying.  I can't help it.  I really can't.  I'm sorry.  I'm absolutely crying.  I can't help it.  I really can't.  This is no great.  You know, the whole moment is kind of...  Um, kind of got me for this video.  Good morning. 
[00:05:30]  Good morning.  Good morning.  Hi.  What's up, Anthony?  What's up, old Jimmy Norton?  I know.  Morning, Mr. Backstreet.  Jimmy's having a little breakfast.  It's Jimmy's turn to eat.  Yeah.  I'll be eating around 9.30.  What do you got there, Jimmy? 
[00:06:00]  Raisin Bran Crunch.  Apple and some yogurt.  Ooh.  Lovely.  We were talking about cereals in the back office.  That's what we do to prepare for this fine radio show.  And I brought in some Honey Nut Cheerios today.  I like my Honey Nut Cheerios when I'm not eating my oatmeal.  Ugh, that oatmeal.  And Anthony goes, uh, you know what I like?  I like a nice bowl of Raisin Bran when I get home. 
[00:06:30]  I have the Raisin Bran.  Mm, mm.  And then I described to Anthony what happens when I have Raisin Bran.  Ugh, it's not pretty.  I gotta make sure I'm not seeing anyone for at least 12 hours when I eat Raisin Bran.  That refinery you call an intestinal tract.  I don't know what happens, but my stomach gets, like, it just gets bloated.  Yeah.  Just gets absolutely bloated with air where you can push it in.  I can push my stomach in and it'll start my farts. 
[00:07:00]  Really?  That's how much air goes in me when I eat Raisin Bran.  And then it's just a disaster the rest of the day.  It's completely disgusting.  Yeah.  Just a complete disaster.  Know what I should do just for a goof?  Have a nice big bowl of Raisin Bran before the show.  No, you shouldn't do that.  Well, we'll put you in your little bowl thing there and you'll be fine.  Please, give me an oxygen tent.  That's what we should do.  You guys want to do that?  How about one morning?  But Anthony's not going to play along. 
[00:07:30]  I know Jimmy would.  What?  I would.  I'm sure some of the other guys would.  We all bring in that one food that makes us fart a lot.  I don't like blasting gas in public.  I don't think we've ever seen you fart.  No, I don't do that.  I think that would be funny, though.  I'm not a very gassy person, I don't think.  We could play Last Man Standing.  Where they get just so awful, the farts, that you tap out and the last person standing gets  to do the show and talk about whatever the hell they want.  I would absolutely say Jimmy would win that. 
[00:08:00]  You just, I don't know, the stuff you eat doesn't really bubble up in you enough.  Well, it bubbles up in you, but it doesn't make, like you don't eat lousy enough food  that it comes out like rancid possum carcass.  Oh, don't worry.  If we're going to have a contest, I'll get into it.  I'll eat differently.  I'll make sure I get a big, huge, heaping plate of sushi and then a nice, big glass of milk.  Some clams that are a little off. 
[00:08:30]  Some clams that are a bit off.  Just a bit off.  Yeah.  Why not, man?  And a lot of spice.  I'll take you on, Jimmy.  I don't know.  At the end of the day, no one's left.  It's just me and you sitting here with erections.  And you're just blasting each other over and over again.  Noses right by each other's assholes, waiting for the next one.  Anticipating.  All right.  Where do we begin today?  People are a little mad at the ecstasy of gold being changed. 
[00:09:00]  Thought we were going into best of.  Oh, they played the wrong version today?  Yeah, played the different one.  Oh.  Yeah, I guess they do something a little wacky.  Shaking it up a little in there, in that room?  No, I guess when we...  Taking it upon themselves in the glass room?  What happened?  It's an all-new version.  It's an all-new version?  Why is it an all-new version?  It's like an opera version.  An opera version?  Who decided to play the all-new version?  That would be Steve.  It's Steve.  Steve is taking on some huge responsibility there.  Well, we told them that we want to mix up the beginning of the show. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, we did.  But that's just like the show opener.  We want to keep the ecstasy...  Right, the music's got to remain consistent.  Yeah, you've got to keep the same ecstasy of gold.  What they do during the worst of is they play a different version just to give you a hint  that we're not going to be there, but...  I just thought you wanted some kind of a change.  That's right, Jimmy.  I thought it was a change.  Ah, ha, ha!  Look at Steve doing Jimmy's impression of him.  That's a very accurate impression.  I look forward to the day...  Even if it's me, I don't care. 
[00:10:00]  I just look forward to the day when Steve fights back and just...  Snaps?  Just punches us once real hard in the middle of the face.  I can't.  I can't because I get locked up the day after.  So, I mean, it wouldn't happen.  You're like the biggest guy here.  You could, like, take over this whole place and you don't...  I could.  You know what?  The reality is you could hit me as hard as you possibly can and you might...  You know, you're probably going to fuck me up.  I hit you as hard as I can, you die.  And that's...  Yeah.  That's wonderful.  And, you know, but that's the reality.  At least he recognizes that.  I have to exercise a tremendous amount of restraint when I get pissed off. 
[00:10:30]  So, I just...  Yeah.  I don't do it.  All right.  What version of Ecstasy of Gold do we play?  Yeah, Martini Douche.  Which one?  That was a live version, a live symphony version.  Live?  The live version.  Yeah, that was done live by...  I think the Berlin Philharmonica could be wrong.  It was so beautiful to hear.  I'm crying here.  Watching on the monitor, he's looking for the coffins.  He's running around past the headstones.  You know, there's things that happen on the show that we just get obsessed with.  My latest obsession is Bruce Kelly crying. 
[00:11:00]  Bruce Kelly crying.  Oh, eventually it'll go away.  Absolutely crying.  And it'll go into the ONA archives.  But right now, that's just a hot topic for me.  It is hot.  And he's nowhere to be found, huh?  He hates us now, huh?  I think he hates us now.  He must.  I think he's finally had it with us, unfortunately.  Has he?  I think so.  He's goofed on him a little too much.  It's just funny, though.  Listen to this.  I'm sorry.  I'm absolutely crying.  I can't help it.  I really can't.  That's like a guy that's been on radio probably, I would guess, 20 years.  And he's been crying on the air over something so silly. 
[00:11:30]  It almost sounds like Bill Murray in Caddyshack.  It's not a plastic explosive or anything.  I'm absolutely crying.  That is my latest obsession, though.  Yeah.  I can't get enough of that.  I got that on my iPod.  I'm playing it all the time.  Just in between every tune, have that one pop in.  I'm podcasting now, man.  I take the cute little things from our show and throw it on my iPod.  That's nice.  That should be a ringtone. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, really.  I'm absolutely crying.  I'm sorry.  I'm absolutely crying.  I can't.  I really can't.  Hello?  Hello, faggot?  That's classic.  You've got to love him.  All right, so people aren't digging the ecstasy of gold.  Really?  I can change it back.  I would have listened if I knew it was new.  I'm going to have to hear that.  I didn't realize it was that different.  But if it's a third replay or something.  Oh, they notice everything. 
[00:12:30]  Of course.  These pains in the asses notice everything.  Yes.  Fucking thing.  We've created some monsters out there.  Monsters.  All right.  Today's intro sucked.  Go back to the old one.  Yeah.  Does he mean the entire intro?  Doesn't like the superhero thing?  I mean, like...  No, I love the superhero thing.  All right.  Don't change that.  I mean, change it eventually.  We're going to mix it up a little bit.  All right.  Well, you guys got something on your mind.  We should just throw this out there and then move on with our radio show. 
[00:13:00]  Throw it on the table?  Yes, sir.  Throw it on the table.  Yes, sir.  One of our enemies in radio lost his wife.  Yeah.  It's a drag.  It's a major drag.  It brought back horrendous memories for me just hearing about it.  And I can understand what the guy's going through.  And personally, I don't like the guy.  I'm not even going to lie to you.  But, you know, but I feel really bad for him.  You don't wish anything like that on your worst enemy, you know? 
[00:13:30]  Not at all.  I still, you know, yeah.  I don't like Don.  You know?  It's not an appropriate time to call him an asshole or anything.  I don't like the guy.  But you can't then just revel in someone's misery like that.  That's just an awful thing to happen to anybody.  I don't care who they are.  Unless, you know, maybe Bin Laden.  All right.  If he had a loved one, you know.  I'd like to see him suffer a little bit.  Yeah, basically, if you haven't heard the story, Don from Don and Mikey, his wife got into just a horrific car accident. 
[00:14:00]  And she lost her life.  And it's just awful.  Simple as that.  It's just awful.  No jokes.  No nothing.  And there's no rhyme or reason with what we do on this program.  But Anthony and I immediately, we didn't even have to think about it, said, hands off.  We're not even going to touch this one.  No.  Not even going to touch it.  And, you know, then the listeners took it upon themselves on one of our message boards to just go off. 
[00:14:30]  And just, you know, just have some ridiculous fun with the whole thing.  Call us hypocrites.  And now they're calling us hypocrites because then we tried to defend ourselves, basically saying, look, dudes, it's just not cool.  Simple as that.  It's just not cool.  Why?  Because we said so.  You know, that's it.  I can't give you a mathematical formula as to why that isn't cool to touch on.  But any of the multitude of other things we've touched on, the Peterson case, the Yates thing, you know, McCartney, like all that. 
[00:15:00]  Why is that good?  But this is off limits.  You know what?  I don't know.  It's just a feeling.  That's what it is.  It's the way I personally feel.  And I know you two do also.  And that's the answer.  You're not going to get some kind of an answer that you can write down on paper and figure out.  Ain't going to happen.  It's just the way it is.  I posted something yesterday.  You posted something beautiful, Jimmy.  It's just common sense.  Well, let me read it.  I read it and I was like, Jesus Christ, that Jimmy is, and Jimmy insightful. 
[00:15:30]  Jimmy basically, yeah, you wrote this on the, oh, you wrote two things?  I, that was, I wrote, I didn't, I didn't, the first time, I didn't want to, I know the fact that we made, look, my sense of humor is barbaric.  Oh, you're a horrible person.  I'm garbage and I know it.  And it was almost like I didn't address the obvious things we make fun of.  Because I almost felt it was over explaining it.  Yeah.  I didn't want to insult.  It's almost like you don't want to talk to people like they're dummies.  Like, yeah, I know people kind of understand this. 
[00:16:00]  So you post something kind of basic and it was amazing to me how many people.  How many dummies?  Just don't come back with, well, how come this is okay?  It's like, I'm not, it's just frustrating to want to grab some dummy and explain to him what you're trying to say.  The best way to explain is just how Anthony explained it.  It's just a feeling.  That's it.  It's a feeling.  Guess what?  Surprisingly, sometimes Opie and Anthony and little Jimmy Norton, we take the high road.  Sometimes we just take the high road.  You're human beings.  You're not machines.  There isn't some thing you can calculate what we're going to say next in any given situation. 
[00:16:30]  If that was the case, like I was saying in the office, grab all of our old shows and based on our past performances of our old shows, you can then take a slide rule, a calculator, whatever you need, and figure out what our shows are going to be in the future.  And we don't even have to show up.  You could just paste it together.  It doesn't work that way.  In this case, we feel, whether it's we're close enough to the situation, whether it's too soon, it doesn't matter what the reason is. 
[00:17:00]  We just feel that this isn't something we want to make light of.  And that's it.  You're going to have to fucking live with that.  That's it.  That's the best answer you're going to get.  And there are times we just do the unexpected.  And that's what we're doing here.  And I felt bad when I heard it.  And I say the unexpected because everyone just thought, oh, this would be just a piece of cake for us to take and run with.  It didn't even enter my mind for a split second. 
[00:17:30]  When I even heard it, it wasn't even confirmed yet.  Right.  It didn't even dawn on me for a second to make light of this.  Not for a second.  You wouldn't want to be in that situation and have colleagues in your business ripping you apart in probably, not probably, in the worst moment of your life.  You just don't want that happening.  I went through this almost a year ago.  I'm up to about 11 months.  I lost my dad in a very similar way. 
[00:18:00]  Right.  And it's just, you know, I just had a horrendous day yesterday because it brought back way too many memories, way too many fucking memories.  A phone call that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.  Simple as that.  Right.  Getting a phone call.  You know, I was in Boston at, what's the place there on Newberry Street?  Sauncy's.  Beautiful day.  Not thinking about anything.  I'm having lunch with Ben.  Phone rings thinking, oh, I was up there for Oedipus' going away party. 
[00:18:30]  Thinking nothing like someone from the party calling me like, hey, you're in town, let's go get a drink.  And you get a phone call from a nurse in a hospital.  Basically saying your parents were in a horrific car accident and your dad's not going to make it.  Yeah, wonderful.  Your life stops.  And it never gets better.  It just, your whole life changes.  Jim Norton wrote this yesterday.  Ope Ann and myself and the rest of the show staff learned about Frida Source's death this afternoon, as did most of you. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, you didn't put epitome in there, did you, Jimmy?  No.  Okay.  Keep reading.  If it's home.  Yeah.  Bombs and flubs.  That's a great bit.  Of course.  Rave reviews.  Except for a couple assholes on whackbag.com.  I just don't read the message board as much as I used to, because the assholes are taking over.  Have fun.  We are obviously stunned by it.  We've all lost people we love, and it's never supposed to happen so unexpectedly.  People you love are supposed to grow old with you and fade slowly, not kiss you goodbye and never come home. 
[00:19:30]  I am sure the listeners understand that when something horrible like this happens, all meaningless radio squabbles prove to be exactly that.  Meaningless.  99% of the listeners will know this intuitively.  I am explaining this to the 1% who may not.  Frida was part of a radio show we went back and forth with, but more importantly, she was a wife and a mother.  Don, Bart, and the rest of their family have had their lives completely and irreversibly altered.  We can control the way we handle and address things on the air, but we cannot control the way listeners respond. 
[00:20:00]  I'm asking on behalf of the show that all of you display the same respect for Don and his family that we intend to.  Not because it's politically correct or for fear of corporate retribution, but because on a human level, it's the way any of us would want to be treated if it were our own families, Jim.  And it's common sense dictates.  It's not a judgment on brutal humor.  And how anybody could have misinterpreted that as a judgment on brutal humor.  Right.  Absolutely not.  Like your passing judgment on what should be used as fodder for humor or not. 
[00:20:30]  Absolutely not.  And it was almost like I didn't want to over-explain that because I'm saying something that probably doesn't need to be said, but it's like, let me just say it.  I'm sure most people get it.  But it was amazing to me how many people come back with, well, how come it's okay to make fun of this and not that?  I know.  It was like, geez, what are you, a third grader?  You think I didn't think of that when I posted?  Yeah.  I just felt it would be insulting and too obvious.  Right.  This is a situation.  How often does it happen where somebody you have a rivalry with has something like this happen? 
[00:21:00]  It's the first time I can remember since the show has obviously been back on.  I can't remember this happening even on the old show where something so awful has happened to somebody that we've gone back and forth with.  Yeah.  It's like, how do you handle it?  What do you do about it?  It's like, I don't want to fuck with that.  I just, I wouldn't want, I wouldn't want to be fucked with.  Right.  On that level.  This is not the Yates.  We know I make fun of the Yates and the Conner and JonBenet and a million awful things.  The difference is, at least for me, is the listeners, let's be honest.  I mean, you guys can be pretty brutal with the message boards, with the emails. 
[00:21:30]  Dumbbells, you would be, in this case, interfering with somebody's grief, whereas the other times it's just a bunch of dumbbells kind of talking shit about something awful, which we all do.  But to do it now, it's like you're actually getting in somebody's face as they're going through it.  Right.  And to me, that was the main difference.  This is going to affect somebody as they're grieving.  And, you know, I mentioned the fact that she was a wife and a mother, not because, for Pete's sake, how can you say anything, but because, like, this is how, we're looking at this as radio people.  It's like, this goes beyond the radio thing. 
[00:22:00]  This is somebody who, you know, she's got a son, and it's like, don't go on the message boards where their fans are grieving and start smashing their faces.  It's just too direct of an assault on somebody.  Direct the connection.  That's not what we do.  There's like, what, one degree of separation.  Yeah.  You know, as opposed to a lot of the stuff we do goof on.  There's so many levels of separation there.  Yeah.  You know, I can't see, what's her name there, Yates tuning in our show. 
[00:22:30]  Absolutely.  And meanwhile, she's the one that did it anyway, so fuck her.  Right.  And, yeah, or, you know, this is a little too close.  And it was, look, the bottom line is there's a rivalry, but it's still a relationship of some sort.  Look, there's never been a physical assault between us and the other show.  They don't like us.  We don't like them.  When something awful happens, you still have a connection on some level, whatever, good or bad.  You still don't want to see something awful like this happen.  And we know how the listeners respond.  And a lot of times, listeners respond very fiercely.  And in this case, it would have been too much. 
[00:23:00]  It would have just hurt the person too much.  It would have went beyond what we normally do, which is just be dickheads.  And I didn't think that needed to be explained, but obviously, well, dude, there should be no limits in humor.  And it's like, no, you fucking dummies.  No one is saying.  Doesn't get the limits on humor.  I know.  I saw that one.  Limits on humor.  No limits on humor.  Oh, wow.  Really?  Really there, Sherlock.  We've always had certain limits here that we just self-impose limits.  And again, it's like we don't make fun of cops that get shot.  Why?  I don't know.  I just don't feel like it. 
[00:23:30]  So I don't.  Right.  We didn't shit on 9-11 when it happened.  No one ever called us hypocrites for that.  Or no one ever called me a hypocrite when I've met them in person.  Dude, how many times have you heard, dude, you're so much nicer than I thought you were going to be.  I can't believe you're not that asshole in the air.  You talk to me.  Why has not one of you ever called me out and said, oh, you're a hypocrite because you didn't scream and yell at me like I'm a caller?  You understand?  So don't be selective when you talk that kind of shit either.  But no one was making a random statement or a sweeping judgment on brutal humor because I will always have that for the rest of my life.  Someone made a pretty valid point about hypocrisy. 
[00:24:00]  It said all the people that were goofing on the situation are hypocrites for not goofing about their dead family members.  It's like now you're a hypocrite.  But if you're willing to make light of this, why not get on there and make jokes about your dead relatives?  Go ahead.  Oh, you're a hypocrite.  Ridiculous.  Some of the people on there are really thick.  Some.  It's amazing how some of them pulled that.  I couldn't believe they pulled that argument.  It was like that was so obvious.  Like, dude. 
[00:24:30]  Like you posted it and then went, uh-oh.  We do a lot of rough things.  Wow.  Now what do we do?  I just didn't want to – sometimes you don't want to over-explain things and insult the intelligence.  I didn't want somebody to come back and go, Dick, we know.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  There's just times I think you got to kind of like – and I know people will say, well, we don't have that relationship.  You guys know Don.  We don't know Don.  But you do have that relationship because they're connected to our show and you're connected to them through our show.  So you do have that kind of – you have a different relationship with Don and Mike than you do with, say, some radio show in Seattle that we've never had a problem with. 
[00:25:00]  So it may not have any type of connection for you, but it's still there on some level.  So you do have that whether you like it or not.  And to the people that felt they didn't have any type of relationship, don't know them from a hole in the wall and don't care, that's fine too.  Fine.  Whatever.  But then don't expect us to get on and start making the jokes that you so want to hear.  You know?  It's just not going to happen.  And then we, you know, we get the postings and emails from people that are, oh, you guys are pussies. 
[00:25:30]  It's like, what?  Pussies?  That doesn't even come into play.  Thick.  And we've never – this is what annoyed me.  It's like we have never asked anything like this to the listeners.  Again, to my memory, especially since at least three of the nine months we've been back on.  Never.  It's not like we're always going there, hey, guys, don't talk about – hey, guys.  We never.  No.  Never.  Never.  Never.  Oh, and there's been a bunch of times we've wanted to for whatever reason, but, you know.  I mean, people on that message board were making fun of my dad's death. 
[00:26:00]  It's like, ugh.  Yeah.  Whatever, man.  You're a fan of the show, but they're like, well, you know, Ope's got to take it because  he, you know, he dishes it out.  So here's what – and then some guy lobbed the first joke thinking everyone was just  going to jump on board.  It's like, no, you're the asshole.  You know?  I just kind of get disgusted with the message board, like – and I know most of them are  really cool, and I like most of them very much, but I just got disgusted in a level  that I didn't think I would.  And it wasn't people disagree with me.  So I've been disagreeing – I've had actual really nasty fights with people on the board. 
[00:26:30]  Uh-huh.  That never turned me off.  But just this argument of, well, you know, humor can't have a limit.  Like, that's what I was saying.  Like, I was self-righteously imposing that and going, oh, for Pete's sake, don't make  fun of death, you fucking dummies.  When have I ever said that?  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  So I posted a response about it, and it just – it was something – it was just kind  of explaining what I just explained.  It was like, it's just a little bit too close.  Uh-huh.  How do you need that explained to you?  Sometimes we just take the high road.  That's all.  It's –  That's all.  Because it's just the right thing to do, and you want – you know, you just – that 
[00:27:00]  was my first reaction when I heard it.  I was like, ugh, that's awful.  Not for the sake of, you know, look at us, we're taking the high road.  Right, right, right.  Not for that sake.  For the sake of a – being a human fucking being.  Well, we just – yeah.  You know?  We decided to take the high road.  That's it.  It just feels right.  Like Anthony said, it's a feeling.  I'm not fighting any – I'm not having this internal battle of taking the high road  or making jokes.  That's, you know, like I said before, it wasn't even an issue.  The second I heard it, it wasn't an issue. 
[00:27:30]  It wasn't any inner monologue going on that I had to make this decision whether I was going  to do this or this.  There was no other option.  It was a no-brainer.  So –  That's it.  There you go.  And there's just some – I mean, message boards in general are made to implode.  The more successful they get, the more people come on board, it just – it reaches maximum  density and just – it just caves in on itself. 
[00:28:00]  And it could be where some of these message boards are going these days.  And we will see.  And again, no one says that we should go on and speak and everyone has to agree.  We understand that you guys all got your own minds and you're supposed to have your own  opinions and not agree with a lot of what we say.  All right, fine.  We've posted plenty of stuff that we've been ripped apart on.  Absolutely.  It's fine.  Whatever.  You know, it's the way it is.  Well, when it's something like this and it's like we never ask you that shit, if someone  wrote back and go, look, how come you guys do this but now you're like this? 
[00:28:30]  If someone wants to question that, if it's a logical question, we'll answer it.  But to come back with like, you know, this guy Uomo sent me one and I'm calling him out.  You're a fucking – you're just a little scumbag and I'd just spit in your fucking face.  I'd love to spit in your fucking face, you faggot with no real name.  Ugh.  I hate these motherfuckers.  Use your real name if you want to talk shit.  Fuck.  What do you say?  It's just about you're a fucking hypocrite.  Like, and it's just not getting – it wasn't a threatening one. 
[00:29:00]  It was just a douche.  And it was just – I think I posted it.  I took this private one and I posted it.  It's going to be private fucking douche.  Yeah.  Post it.  One guy posted, it's all or nothing.  You either goof on what you goof on or you don't.  And I actually had a post written down and I just deleted it.  I was like, I'm not going to get into this with this shit.  Just – I said fuck it yesterday and just stop posting.  But the answer to it's all or nothing is why? 
[00:29:30]  What?  Who is the guy with the rule book that says it's got to be all or nothing?  What – and – and what if it's not all or nothing?  The show falls apart?  What?  It's never all or nothing on this show.  We're very selective about what we talk about.  You know what the shit is we don't talk about?  That's right.  You don't hear it because we didn't fucking talk about it.  We're very selective as to what we talk about and don't talk about.  And if you can't see consistency in our show, sorry. 
[00:30:00]  Because a lot of times there isn't any consistency.  It's just based on how we feel at any given moment.  That's it.  And there was one self-imposed rule.  It was never discussed.  But even we were fighting with Don and Mike.  We never talked about – Bart.  Why?  He wasn't a part of the radio show.  He was just a kid.  It was never anything – no one ever called us out like, how come you guys – it was just like a self-imposed –  like, eh, it's just not – it's got nothing to do with what we're talking about.  So we did have a limit there.  We've had other limits that just – again, you don't talk about.  They're just common sense limits.  So the one time we make that request to have to get shit from some of the people is just really, really irritating. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, this douchebag.  Ugh.  Ugh.  I wanted to bite his face because he's just such a dummy making a third-grade argument.  Uh, Norton, your hypocritical pseudo-morality represents – your hypocritical pseudo-morality represents everything I hate in a human being.  Really?  Is that everything you hate, man?  Really?  Yeah, man.  A phony cocksucker – you're not phony. 
[00:31:00]  Not at all.  Like you.  You should have seen me under that porch.  I was as real as real can be, fella.  Makes fun of thousands of tsunami victims, laughs hysterically at dead babies like Susan Smith and Andrew Yates, murder victims, and relentlessly delivers hundreds of Lil' Conner jokes.  Suddenly, you get a self-righteous bug up your ass and dredge up the gall to pontificate about how the dead wife of fat radio host is off-limits.  Man, fuck you, Norton.  Gee, this – I just responded. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, okay.  I responded as vicious to him one-on-one.  But, again, that was what I just explained.  It was like the difference is our being dicks about these public stories is not getting right into the face of a person who is suffering, which is what would happen here.  Even the Donald Mike fans, man, they're fucking grieving.  Let them grieve.  When it comes to these other things, you don't go to the websites of the people who are suffering and attack them, which is probably what would happen here.  And it's like, eh, in this case, again, we haven't dealt with this.  We don't know how to deal with it.  Just please don't do it. 
[00:32:00]  And this is the response.  The one time we mention it.  It's off-limits, man.  Yeah, that's what I said.  I can make fun of Lacey, but everything that you might want to make fun of is off-limits.  That's exactly what I'm saying, you dummy, umo, jizzbag without a real name.  Just doesn't get it.  No real profile.  I love these fucking guys.  Don't put it –  Zero accountability.  That's the only thing I don't like on message boards is that it's like you guys get the right to say whatever you want,  and I have never wanted message boards censored, ever.  But the fact when you hide it, you don't use your real name.  It's like you guys know our real names. 
[00:32:30]  You know what I do for a living.  You know what I look like.  I don't hide anything.  As far as, like, you know what an ass I am and who I am, umo, fucking faggot.  All right, let's go to the phones really fast, and then we'll move on with the radio program.  Doug out, Doug from Whack Bag.  What's up?  Doug?  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Is the phone on?  I don't know why that would – no, whatever.  Doug, what's up?  Yeah, the mods on the board, I just wanted to take a hat off to those guys,  because they did a really good job modding this and keeping it down to a dull roar. 
[00:33:00]  They don't want the message board really to be a haven for people to defend, basically,  like you guys have been reading anyway.  It's not funny.  It's not good.  I actually got a couple emails or PMs saying,  General, when do we attack?  I'm like, you've got to be kidding me.  There's absolutely no way you'd do something like that.  The Lacey stuff, the Yates stuff, it's almost funny and humorous because of how it happened. 
[00:33:30]  Not because these people died, but because it's so outrageous.  It's like, Jesus Christ, you know?  This car accident, that could happen to anybody.  And, dude, and I make no bones about it.  I have gallows, awful humor, and I've said a lot of awful shit, and I always will.  It's always been my humor, and it's not going to change, and I'm not asking any of you to change that.  It was almost like that was what offended me or irritated me, this guy saying I have pseudo-morality.  I'm not coming at you from that point of view.  Yeah.  I'm the last guy you should think with. 
[00:34:00]  So it's almost like I have the most brutal sense of humor as any of you.  Believe me, I do.  And if I'm going, look, could we just...  You couldn't just give me the benefit of the doubt, or go, yeah, all right, well, these guys are assious, obviously, for a reason.  No, no, no.  I've got to jump on you.  Do you understand?  It's like I could see if we were self-righteous and we always went to the boards.  Hey, guys, don't say that.  That's mean.  Never.  Yeah.  Fucking never.  Now, I'm not yelling at you, Doug.  I mean, I know you get it.  I talked to you yesterday, but it's like a lot of them just don't.  I just joined in on some real heinous and horrendous posts on the message board and Photoshop and all that. 
[00:34:30]  Of course.  Dude, after we did that Lady McCartney thing, I felt like I needed a shower.  I know.  It was awful.  I really felt awful that whole night.  Oh.  I felt awful.  And then when I woke up the next morning, the alarm clock went off, and it was a Paul McCartney song.  Really?  I swear to you.  I absolutely remember.  I woke up, and I just was like, oh, I feel like shit.  All right, Doug.  Thank you, buddy.  Thanks, Doug.  Take it easy.  All right, let's go to John in Jersey.  John, what's up?  Yeah, I mean, I cannot believe that you guys even have to address it. 
[00:35:00]  It's ridiculous.  Some of the guys are doing it to push buttons, hiding behind their computers.  But you having to address this takes away from the show more than if you would goof.  There's no reason to goof on it.  Yeah.  I mean, it's outrageous.  I mean, they're fucking up the show by making you guys address this.  Yeah.  There are plenty of things for you to goof on.  Dude, it's one percent, too.  Most of them got it intuitively.  Yeah.  It's just that one percent.  And again, we know. 
[00:35:30]  And I understand some of them just went after it initially because, hey, it was an event.  They're unconnected to it.  They went after it just because it was a thing that happened.  And all right, whatever.  But then once it was like, hey, could you kind of not because of this, that's when I  got really irritated.  Not even the initial response, which is just people responding to an event.  I mean, when you get right down to it, I mean, I think the other day, whatever, it's stupid  radio.  You guys do it better than anyone else.  And I want to laugh.  And there's no reason to laugh or make fun of this.  I mean, there are plenty of other things to goof on. 
[00:36:00]  I mean, you're too close to the guy.  The guy's still a different guy.  He's a hack, fucking radio, bullshit guy.  But this is different.  Yeah, man.  He's a guy.  I mean, we haven't liked to see those radio shows.  But, you know, it's like, eh.  I was going to take it to that level.  There's no fun in it for you, I don't think.  And there's no fun.  I don't think.  There's no fun in it for me personally.  I mean, you know, I'm a husband, a father.  I'm going to work.  I want to laugh, you know?  Right.  And not with this bullshit.  All right, thank you.  Take it easy, guys.  Thank you, John. 
[00:36:30]  Very good.  Let's go to Marcus.  Marcus, go ahead.  Hey, I just want to point out.  Last time I checked, this is called the Opie and Anthony show.  Y'all can talk about whatever the hell y'all want.  Oh, we absolutely will.  Well, the deal here is we're a very interactive radio show,  so at times we have to kind of, you know, squash what happens on these message boards.  Because, believe it or not, in the end, we kind of believe in participation and message boards and things like that.  And if you don't address this from time to time, the message boards will just have to go away  because they don't help the show on any level whatsoever. 
[00:37:00]  So that's the point we're coming from as well, you know what I mean?  That's when they go away.  I may not necessarily agree with everything you'll say,  but I ain't getting on there calling y'all a fuck face and all this stupid bullshit.  I mean, it's over with people.  I mean, we're a very interactive radio show.  That's why we have to address this stuff from time to time because, you know, it just gets out of control to a point.  We don't need that message board anymore is what I'm down to.  You put it perfectly. 
[00:37:30]  When it stops helping the show or stops supporting the show, then there's no reason for us to even deal with it anymore.  There are times that the message board becomes a place where they just bitch about the show.  They're supposedly fans.  I understand bitching here and there, but we know when we stink.  We don't need everyone else to point it out.  We go home and go, oh, man, that was a bad show.  That blows.  And then you have to read some of these message boards where they just get obsessed with picking apart every dumb little bad thing about the show.  And then it's like, well, how does that help us in the end when it's supposed to be an Opie and Anthony, quote, fan type? 
[00:38:00]  Well, there's some people that do that and constantly do that, and they get pissed off when it's pointed out to them and go, hey, it's an open forum, man.  I'll say whatever I want about that.  And you know something?  You're absolutely right.  Go ahead.  The board will never be mentioned.  And believe me, when the boards don't get mentioned, they go away.  It's happened in the past.  They just go away.  And then you're stuck with, you know, five idiots arguing with each other on a formally good message board. 
[00:38:30]  I used to love reading the message boards.  I barely read them.  I go there maybe real quick, scan and see what's going on, and that's about it.  I used to really get into it.  You know what I read?  Off topic.  I don't even read about the show anymore on message boards.  I go to, like, Photoshop, video games, things like that.  There were times I was going there, and if you didn't know much about the show, but you would read this message board for whatever reason, you would think that this is the worst radio show in America.  Yeah.  And then I'm thinking, what?  Knowing how, you know, we've been on a roll or whatever, you know, like the show's just killing every day. 
[00:39:00]  But you go on the message boards, and you don't get that same feeling because there's stupid idiots there that'll take that one dumb thing that sucked that morning or whatever and just blow it out of proportion to a point.  It's like, why are we even bothering promoting these people?  People that take their own opinions, which are fine.  You know, if you didn't like a segment or you didn't like a whole show, that's fine.  But the way they post it is, the show sucked or the show sucks and not, you know, I thought it sucked. 
[00:39:30]  It's never their opinion.  It's, boy, I don't know what's happened.  They really suck lately.  And, like, dude, don't listen.  And, like I said, I know when we suck.  Yeah.  Believe me, we're the first ones to know.  We're the first ones to know when we suck.  And there are a lot of times we know we're not sucking, and it's portrayed that way on these message boards.  Hey, Arthur, what's up?  Hey, yeah, I just thought I'd let you guys know that you guys are great.  I got tired of, you know, like commercial radio, and then I got XM, and I stumbled on you guys. 
[00:40:00]  Man, you guys are like a plus to this XM.  Man, I laugh my ass off every fucking day.  And if you decide not to talk about something, you know, you don't have to.  You know, it's your show.  But I just thought I'd let you guys know you guys are a great show.  Thank you.  All right, buddy.  Thank you.  Hi, man.  Y'all have a good one.  All right.  Yeah, we're going to move on with the show.  A bunch of people are saying that.  But we just wanted to address that.  Yeah.  We got Keith the Cop's motorcycle ride tomorrow. 
[00:40:30]  We should get this business out of the way, too, so we can actually start being funny.  Keith the Cop has a little motorcycle ride happening from New York to Philly tomorrow.  Going to end up at Club Risque in Philadelphia.  Club Risque.  Basically, you don't even need a motorcycle to go down there, but they're leaving from the studio at 7.30 tomorrow morning.  It's going to be a lot of fun tomorrow.  Yeah.  A lot of girls flashing on the way, I believe.  Beautiful girls.  Beautiful girls on the back of bikes.  Maybe some of the girls even driving the bikes.  I saw a couple of those over the weekend.  They're always hot. 
[00:41:00]  Motorcycle mamas.  Sorry, chicks that ride bikes.  And then Pat from Menachie's going, and other listeners are going in their cars.  If you want to join Keith and the gang, you just have to be at the station tomorrow before 7.30 when they take off.  We're at, what, 111 57th Street between 6th and 7th Avenue.  Yes, Ben?  I saw Jamaican Mike yesterday.  Yeah, man.  He wanted to know the route of the bike.  So the bikes are going to go down 57th to 9th Avenue.  So if guys that are in Manhattan want to see it, because it's going to be when a lot of people are going to work. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  And then also, I remember from a couple weeks ago, we're going to have girls handing out WOW stickers going down the route,  just walking around New York tomorrow on the show, too.  Oh, we've got a lot of stuff going on.  And then, you know, then there's an opportunity to join the motorcycle ride en route.  You know, maybe you'll see them coming by.  I guess you're going to take the New Jersey Turnpike all the way down?  Yeah, the route's actually up on Foundry.  Okay.  I know, Keith, the last time he did it, they stopped at a rest area so other people could join him or something.  So we'll figure it out on the fly tomorrow. 
[00:42:00]  But what I want to bring up is the fact that we wanted the Opie and Anthony van to join us.  Oh, yeah.  Here we go.  This is one of the first appearances we've done in a long time.  Supposedly, we have this van in Washington.  We watch it.  People that have been to live appearances know what this looks like.  It's the Opie and Anthony van.  I don't think it's the Opie and Anthony van anymore.  That's what I want to talk about.  I think they painted over it.  Do you?  No doubt in my mind.  It had our dopey cartoon faces on it.  It said Opie and Anthony, XM, 202, all over the thing. 
[00:42:30]  And it was our van when we showed up in appearances.  It was parked in front.  This satellite radio thing is changing by the day.  I think there's a new band in town, a new hot band.  Really?  Might be Major League Baseball.  I don't know.  I think it's something else.  Oh, boy.  We were the it thing for a couple weeks.  Do you think they painted golf balls on it?  Oh, that's it.  Yeah.  The golf?  They joined the golf.  Yeah, they got the golf channel up and running.  Maybe it's that.  Maybe it's golf.  But I know when we went down to Washington, we watched that van just sit in the parking 
[00:43:00]  lot day in and day out.  Yeah.  They never used it to actually promote the show.  Air America.  Maybe a big picture of Janine Garofalo on the side.  I never understood that we had an Opie and Anthony van and it wasn't out there every day  handing out stuff.  Yeah.  It's like no-brainer radio crap.  The only time that van goes out is when an intern has to pick up lunch for Elo or Straylo  or Hugo or any of the other O's and Lowe's down there. 
[00:43:30]  That's the only time that it gets exposure on the street.  Every time we were there, we'd pull up and that thing would just be parked in the parking  lot, not out, not doing anything.  Hey, can we get a ride to the hotel?  Well, no, it's already been promised to somebody else.  Yes, yeah.  Well, that's the point I want to make.  So it's supposedly the Opie and Anthony van and we need it for our wow motorcycle ride  tomorrow and we can't get the van because someone else is using it.  Someone else has it reserved, they said.  Someone else has reserved the Opie and Anthony van for tomorrow.  For what? 
[00:44:00]  But we're Opie and Anthony.  For what?  It's the Opie and Anthony van.  If Opie and Anthony need it, perhaps Opie and Anthony should get it.  Why don't you rent another van for whoever else needs it?  How about that?  You spend 80 bucks and rent another van for people that have that van.  That's why in the end we just do everything ourselves and we'll get the...  Unless it's being used to take the president to the airport, then I'll understand it'll probably  get a little more coverage than it will in Philly.  It probably is an Air America thing.  And it's probably painted over you guys and there's a picture of a white person just 
[00:44:30]  apologizing to criminals.  Air America.  So we're sorry that we're superior.  God, that's funny.  That would make a great van.  Just a paternalistic whitehead.  Maybe you see a white hand coming down and just patting a black head.  A little nappy black afro on the top of the head. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah, but it's an adult in a suit.  It's an adult black male in a suit and just a white hand with a white suit just patting  it in a paternalistic, I'll help you a long way.  I will help you because you can't help yourselves kind of way.  So, I mean, we've asked for this van to, you know, hang out in New York and hand out  wow stickers and things like that.  We just can't get it done.  I don't know why.  And then we have Pat from Monaki who pretty much has decorated his van with as much wow and  Opie and Anthony stuff as possible.  And he even wants the company to just pay for a quick paint job because he just rides 
[00:45:30]  that thing.  I don't know.  I think he puts on like almost 100,000 miles a year on the thing.  He's like, look, dude, just, you know, pay for the paint job.  You can paint your logo all over this thing and I'll just drive around.  And we can't get that done either.  No, can't get that going.  And that's just simple promotion.  That's promotion 101.  Who's got the van?  Did we find out?  We have to find out before the end of the show who's got the van.  Who gets the Opie and Anthony van?  And guaranteed it's not going to be for something that is needed, that needs the Opie and Anthony 
[00:46:00]  van.  Like Jimmy said, any van will do.  They could rent a van and use that, but no.  By the way, Paul's calling me out on a technicality.  I know it's a wrap and it's not, they don't really paint them anymore.  We know that.  It's like a, almost like a shrink wrap thing they do.  We understand.  But, you know, I'm going old school.  But why, why wouldn't that be available?  Why?  It's a real thing.  The show gets the van.  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me.  The show gets the van. 
[00:46:30]  Come on.  So, uh, Don Wick is, uh, Wickland is, uh, getting to the bottom of that one.  Wiki?  I'd love to know who has that.  Who's in charge of that where he has to go, Opie and Anthony need the van?  We already have it rented out.  Well, how about this?  You're a major corporation.  Buy another fucking van.  Buy a van.  Your XM satellite.  You did 600,000 subscriptions.  Yeah.  Maybe rent another van for the other people on the rare occasion that we need the one with  the Opie and Anthony faces on it to promote. 
[00:47:00]  The stock's riding high.  Jesus.  And I'm sure they could get a, probably get one from General Motors for nothing.  It's ridiculous.  I, uh, I gave up.  You know me, eh?  Well, the TV commercial.  I'm a go-getter.  I'm the guy that's on the phone every day after the show trying to get things done.  I just gave up.  It's like, I, might as well as Elo, you know, he, he, uh.  Have Elo call the van and get a location check.  Elo taught us this.  Check-ass.  You know, you can control, you know, control the thing, you know, we can control this. 
[00:47:30]  This.  What we do.  Our surroundings right here.  Yeah, turning on the mics and doing a show.  That's what we can control.  And we do a very good job with that every day.  The other stuff I can't control anymore.  I can't get anything done.  I mean, I understand there's a national talk show.  It's really simple, though.  It's so simple.  It's Promotion 101.  If we have an Opie and Anthony van, you give it to us.  You find a parking spot in New York City.  We get our interns or we hire anybody to just drive around every single fucking day. 
[00:48:00]  Hand out stickers.  Handing out wow stickers, promotional items.  Go to the beaches over the weekend.  Fourth of July just happened.  I'm sure the Opie and Anthony van was nowhere.  A street team.  It's called a street team.  A street team.  Every stupid radio station in America has.  They have radios.  Even for the dumbest radio stations.  They do little games at their beach stops and give away radios.  Things like that.  That's what they do.  Yeah, you hire girls to walk around with tiny little outfits and then hand out wow stickers.  It's Promotion 101. 
[00:48:30]  I know it's a national talk show, but you start in New York.  There's so many events happening in New York, you can get a lot of exposure.  And guess what?  Those people in New York have friends in other cities.  And they're going to go, wow, you know, I've been listening to this Opie and Anthony show on XM.  You should try it out.  That's how it happens.  That's why we call it Spread the Virus.  Because it's a type of show where, you know, you start talking about it to other people.  And that's how it grows.  But you have to also promote.  And you start in New York, the center of the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:49:00]  And then if we need the van for this Philly thing, guess what?  Then we expand to Philly a little bit for a day or two.  Yeah.  But instead, we just get, oh, I don't have it set up here.  We get nothing.  Yeah.  No promotion whatsoever.  And we're not asking to spend money.  How about the T-commercial?  It's a van.  It's a parking spot.  And it's hiring some people to hand out stickers.  We could be doing that every day.  You could go where the commuters are.  You could go to the beaches on the weekends.  I've said all this.  You could go to concerts. 
[00:49:30]  There's a concert every fucking night in New York City.  Then expand a little bit if you can.  And we're a pretty unique out there show, so it's not one of those things where XM's  got to say, well, if we give it to you guys, you know, what, the 40s channel is going to  need one?  You know, it's not one of these shows where Bob Edwards is going to need a van to go to  the beaches and, you know, bore people on their blankets.  He already has one for his listeners.  It's a hearse.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit. 
[00:50:00]  They put his picture.  They use that rap stuff when they put his picture on his van.  And everyone thought that they had screwed up and wrinkled it all up, but it was just  his face.  Poor Bob Edwards.  Never badmouthed us at all.  The man is a ghoul.  He just walks around and nods when he sees us.  There's nothing bad to say about us.  He's fine.  You know who he looks like?  Remember Zachary?  The old guy that used to do the late night horror movies on Channel 11?  Oh, my God.  Very good.  Introduced Dracula movies?  Very good. 
[00:50:30]  He'd look great in a Dracula cape.  So, I don't get it.  I thought this was a no-brainer to get the opening Anthony van to one of our rare appearances,  but...  And a brilliant marketing move.  But, uh...  Brilliant.  But that ain't getting done, either.  Brilliant.  Very qualified.  Help us out.  Brilliant.  Well, I'm just looking for...  Let's find out where the van is, though.  Huh?  Let's find out where the van's going to be tomorrow.  Right.  Let's find out what's more important.  But even if they give us the van, it's not enough.  We should have the van every day, especially in the summer in New York.  Let's just start promoting in New York. 
[00:51:00]  That's a good head start.  It's summer in New York.  We should have had a head start on this a month ago.  We should have been doing the beaches and doing the street team.  We should have people in Times Square every day.  All these rubes from all over the country are coming into Times Square every fucking day.  Looking for any free stuff, even a sticker.  That would require marketing.  Yeah.  Do we even have a marketing department at this point?  I really don't know, because I don't talk to anyone for marketing.  We've got to do it ourselves through strip clubs. 
[00:51:30]  How does that feel when you have a marketing department?  And we've got to do it ourselves through strip clubs.  Right.  I'm sure that will happen in January.  I'm sure that will happen across the street in January.  That's exactly the way it will be done.  You've got to help us out here a little bit.  Right?  Fucking mind-boggling.  It really is.  It's just mind-boggling, man.  And then we come up with simple ideas like, all right, this guy, Pat from Minaki, he drives  all over the tri-state area.  He drives to Philly, even, and Connecticut.  He's all over the East Coast, basically. 
[00:52:00]  And he's a massive fan of the show.  Granted, his van is awful looking.  But we throw a little wrap on there.  And look, free exposure every day.  Yeah.  Every day.  And he's willing to hand out the wow stickers every day as he goes.  Right.  Can't get that done either.  And that's a freebie, basically.  How much does a wrap cost?  Look at the stock.  36 bucks a share.  They're rolling in the dough, Opie.  Rolling in the dough, XM.  Yeah, but there's just so much more we could do as a company. 
[00:52:30]  So much more we could do as a show, that's for sure.  I won't even say as a company, because I really don't know what they're doing.  I really don't.  I know what's going on with this show.  I know we're busting our hump every day.  I know that Don Wicklund down there in Washington is fighting for us every day.  But there's just so much they could do with this show.  Yeah.  So much.  And we're not asking for a huge ad campaign.  That would be nice.  Never happening.  But I don't want to be delusional.  I mean, but there's a lot of dumb little things that don't cost much money that really get the word out. 
[00:53:00]  As far as the show goes.  Have you talked to marketing at all?  Nah, they hate us, I guess.  Who cares to neutral?  Yeah, we goofed on them a little too much.  I was talking to them at least two or three times a week when we first started, and I just gave up.  Because nothing was getting accomplished except a lot of, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, that's a good idea.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Maybe Howard will do another event.  You can latch on to that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Excuse me.  Did you just say that as a marketing person?  All I remember is that...  Cricket, cricket.  Cricket, yeah.  All I remember is we had a meeting with marketing where they said that they had big things for us in 05, remember? 
[00:53:30]  And I just sat back and said, okay, well, guess what?  It's 2105, Opie, is what they meant.  Huh?  They meant 2105.  It's going to be a few years off.  But I remember they kept saying that was their excuse why, and they're like, no, a lot of things will happen for you guys in 05.  A lot of marketing, a lot of big ideas for you guys in 05, 05, 05, 05.  Look at the calendar.  05 is half over officially.  You guys taped the TV commercial audio.  Did that ever happen for the MyFight?  Oh, remember that?  Where was that? 
[00:54:00]  Where is it?  It was supposed to run during the...  I really don't know.  ...little news programs.  Yeah.  But guess what?  05 is officially half over, and I haven't seen any marketing.  There won't be any.  It's like a TB ward in here today between me and you and Jimmy.  I know.  I just have that stupid mucus.  I'm not sick.  I had to get tissues today.  I got a cold coming on.  I have a little cold coming on.  All right, we're going to...  I got the sniffles.  Do you?  We're going to take a break, Anne, and we're going to regroup here. 
[00:54:30]  Uh-huh.  We got to talk about Hogan's show.  God, is it awful.  What Hogan's show?  Hulk Hogan's doing a show with his hot daughter.  What does he do?  Is it a reality show?  Yeah, we'll get into it next.  That's the problem.  It's this celebrity reality shows that are coming out and becoming really huge now,  because there's a lot of celebrities that just have no work out there,  so now they're all stepping up to the plate and getting involved with this reality programming.  When did the reality show really start?  Was it with...  I know the real world, but... 
[00:55:00]  You've got to go back to the real world.  Yeah, but they have other examples before that, but the real world really made reality  program in the forefront.  But when did it really...  But that was...  How long ago?  15 years ago?  No.  The real world?  They're up to 15 years?  We're talking 15 years, dude.  15 years.  Easily.  So I'm talking...  It was there, but it really didn't...  It didn't really start...  When did it really start where everything...  Survivor.  Survivor?  Survivor.  Big Brother.  Big...  Not Big Brother. 
[00:55:30]  You picked the biggest flop reality show.  Good job, E-Rock.  Everybody like Eric.  What the fuck's wrong with you?  Eric, what are you talking about?  Jesus, Big...  Big Brother was big everywhere.  Talk on the mic.  Give him a microphone.  Big Brother was big.  Shut up, would you?  You really did pick the worst reality show.  Oh, actually, Opie, you loved that show.  I liked it, but no one was watching it.  But to put it as a reality show, that might have kicked off the whole craze.  Jesus, Eric.  It might have been Joe Millionaire.  Joe Millionaire was a big one, but I guess before then they had happened. 
[00:56:00]  Survivor.  Survivor was huge.  I think Survivor kind of kicked that off.  And what year was that?  Because I'm just wondering if the thousands here, the 2000, is going to be known as like,  in the future, as that whole reality show decade where the TV's just full of it.  Like, it's got to stop at some point.  I think it's one of those things that are going to fade out.  I don't think so.  Not at all.  No, I think it's just going to keep developing and growing.  I think it's going to actually get better. 
[00:56:30]  They're going to figure it out.  You think so?  Yeah, definitely.  Because I'm really sick of them, man.  I can't get involved with any of them.  They take a big commitment, first of all.  You can't just watch episode to episode.  I turn on Seinfeld.  I watch an episode.  I'm laughing.  I didn't have to see the episode before.  I don't have to see the one after.  That is a good point.  I kind of like that.  These, it's such a time commitment to watch these frigging things.  I've been watching the cooking one, which, you know, I'm watching a fucking cooking show,  for God's sake. 
[00:57:00]  And it's the same episode every week.  Get that plate out there.  I'm closing down the kitchen.  Oh, he's closing the kitchen again.  Jesus Christ.  He's yelling at the fat guy.  Oh, he's yelling at the broad.  But why am I watching this?  That's why I love the marathons.  Man, you get a rainy day, and you got, like, a real-world marathon or something.  Celebrity Fit Club marathon.  You're one right after the other.  Oh, you're in for the day, man.  I start, finish, I'm done with this show.  One day.  You're done.  Big brother. 
[00:57:30]  Big brother.  Nobody watched that, and you're talking about it like it's the last mash.  Oh.  Yeah.  Someone was saying the first reality show, cops.  Cops.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Survivor was actually a concession.  Survivor was the one that just threw it on everyone's plate, basically.  Well, the original concept for that, it was a chick that Ben-Banged during a one-night  stand.  Survivor actually came out when we were at AEW, right?  Because we had Jervis.  Remember, was Jervis on the first season?  Yep.  And Richard Jervis, right? 
[00:58:00]  No, that was Richard the Fag.  Yeah.  Richard the Fag, who doesn't pay his taxes.  That's a great one.  And your brother's song that made it on Howard's song contest.  Yeah.  We got in trouble for that one, too.  God, what a dick he is.  And that's a lack of...  He has no sense of humor whatsoever.  Howard Stern had this parody...  What was it again?  It was a song parody contest.  Song parody contest.  And Anthony's brother had two or three submissions that were in, like, the top five.  Yeah.  And Howard's rant and raving how great these songs are.  And then we finally go on our show and, you know... 
[00:58:30]  They're like, ah, it's our guy doing that, Howard.  We let everyone in on the gag that we, you know, infiltrated his stupid contest.  And instead of being, like, you know, having a sense of humor and going with it somehow  or blasting us back, it goes behind the scenes and talks to our bosses.  And we almost got fired for it.  Like, doesn't anyone have fun in radio anymore?  Again, it was Ken Stevens walking in shaking.  We almost got fired for something as stupid as that.  Did you send songs into Howard's show that... 
[00:59:00]  What?  Who cares?  Yeah.  Why?  Now what?  We fucked up the whole contest because then he had to pick, like, other songs that weren't  as good to be the winners of the contest.  Threw my brother's ass out of the contest.  Lickety split.  That's when Imus really...  Don't we owe your brother a lot of prizes for that?  Yeah, fuck him.  Because he was going to win?  That's when Imus really became a big fan.  Remember Imus said what a brilliant idea it was when he was talking about Joe Song on  his show?  That's why Imus is wearing the Opie and Anthony XM satellite radio shirt on his show and talking  about us.  He really, really likes the fact that we never back down to that douchebag. 
[00:59:30]  What problem with a doctor, though, Imus has, huh?  Yeah, we should get into that next.  Imus just does have a loud mouth.  He just has reached a point in his life where he doesn't care.  And he says things that really do get him in trouble sometimes.  I guess he was bad-mouthing this doctor that worked on his ranch for the cancer kids.  Yeah.  And the doctor's suing him now.  On the air, you mean?  For bad-mouthing him, yeah.  We could take a break into that story next.  Oh, right.  Doctors stink.  No sense of humor.  The stick of the gloved finger in people's assholes for 30 years. 
[01:00:00]  You know what?  I feel bad for...  Not for this guy, but I do feel bad for doctors because they're just victims of lawsuits  lawsuits after lawsuits.  I was talking, because I'm looking for a house, so I'm talking to a mortgage guy, and  he tells me, he goes, somehow we just started talking about who owns their houses and what  do you put the house in, a company name or your own name, things like that.  And he said, you will not find a doctor that has his house in his own name because it will  get taken away from him in a lawsuit. 
[01:00:30]  People expect doctors to be 100% all the time, and when they're not, they assume they  could just sue because the doctor didn't cure this disease or, you know, fix him up, so  doctors have it pretty rough.  Why does Charles McCord have to...  He doesn't wear the headset that he doesn't want to must his hair up on TV.  Yeah, so he wears those oldie-style airplane headphone-looking things that they used to  give you, like a stethoscope.  Yeah, he looks like a doctor.  Anthony, this guy's a problem.  Oh, go ahead.  No problem.  Kenny, go ahead. 
[01:01:00]  Hey, Anthony.  Kenny's the comedian around here.  Anthony, you said you like Seinfeld because you can watch an episode and you don't have  to see the previous one, and you can laugh and laugh.  You know, you're part of a show that you have to pretty much listen to every day to really  know what the hell's going on.  Oh, I know, but it's not a reality show on TV, and this is casual listening.  You know, you don't have to catch every episode to laugh.  I listen to that almost every day, and I had to ask my friend, what the hell's Liddy?  What the hell's Liddy?  You don't even want to know.  Liddy stinks anyway. 
[01:01:30]  We should, from time to time, just take questions from the listeners to explain some of the  storylines.  But basically, there's so much more going on with this show.  You know, you still get laughs just listening once, and you don't have to listen again.  I'll use the Seinfeld analogy again.  You don't have to see previous episodes of Seinfeld to enjoy that episode, but it is better  if you had, because a lot of times they call back on an earlier episode.  So like this, you could tune in on a day, and you'll laugh.  But if you're a big fan of the show, you'll laugh even more. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  Who are these people?  Oh, Liddy.  I thought everyone knew.  That was Seinfeld, right?  I thought everyone knew who Liddy was.  It's basically...  G-Yogurt Liddy.  He's just a friend.  It's Norton's yogurt lid.  It's a yogurt lid that Norton takes off.  It's a little blue yogurt lid, and he folds it in the middle to make a little mouth,  and it talks.  Go ahead, say something, Liddy.  Oh, he's all scared now.  He's just chattering his little lid teeth. 
[01:02:30]  Liddy.  Liddy.  Liddy.  Liddy.  Wait, we got XMTV outtakes?  The audio or something?  What is this, Derek?  Who has this to me?  Oh, Derek threw his hands up in disgust.  Oh, you know what?  Eric brought it to me.  And not knowing this.  Eric suggested that we play XMTV outtakes going into break.  He's watching Big Brother.  Did we play this?  I can't believe he said Big Brother out of every reality show.  Oh, what's the one that really started it off? 
[01:03:00]  I know, you know, Real World and Survivor with Big Brother.  Well, Big Brother it is then.  Either that or Fat Actress.  Good point.  Where is he?  Get him in here.  I want to smash his teeth with my fist.  My two favorite reality shows these days, The Surreal Life.  They got a new one with Jose Canseco and a bunch of other messes.  Like Willie Ames from Eight is Enough is on it.  Wow.  And a few others.  Some supermodel that is just drugged out.  Love it.  I just caught a peak yesterday.  That I'm going to watch every week. 
[01:03:30]  And then Celebrity Fit Club 2.  Can't get enough of the fat celebrities.  Yeah.  Can't get enough of them.  Again, that commitment to be there watching every week.  You've got to watch Celebrity Fit Club 2 just for Gary Busey.  Gary Busey is one of the guys trying to lose weight.  He is out of his fucking mind.  Well, there was that show a while ago that Busey had where he had that kid that joined  him.  I'm with Busey.  I'm with Busey.  I used to watch that and he's insane.  And he really is.  It's not an act. 
[01:04:00]  The guy is crazy.  He should get help somewhere.  But they keep putting him on TV.  Well, no.  I know what happened.  He had that motorcycle accident.  Yeah.  It shook up his brain.  Screwed his skull up.  Enough where it's just made him nuts.  He came to a show one time.  I was working with Dice years ago at Rascals in West Orange.  And I guess he's a fan.  He came in with somebody.  Comes backstage after the show.  He didn't realize I just performed.  And he is a maniac.  Because I love Gary Busey.  So I got a couple pictures with him.  And the whole time he told me the same joke three times.  And he's got his arm around me.  And he's a strong fucking hillbilly.  Yeah.  He's digging his fingers into my sides, tickling. 
[01:04:30]  He's going, hehehe.  And I'm like, ow, ow, ow.  You're being raped.  Yeah.  I'm basically being date raped by the man from Carnie.  And Mr. Joshua put his arm around me.  Oh, wow.  Your arm, please.  That over-actor in the original, please love it.  Mr. Joshua, your arm.  Hold it out.  Your arm, please.  Over-actor.  The general.  He burnt it or put a lighter on it. 
[01:05:00]  He held the lighter.  Thank you.  Hey, what is this?  That's the song Joe did on Howard.  I know.  It's six minutes long, though.  Jesus.  It's an epic.  What?  It said 34 seconds.  34.  Look.  If we were going to play something six minutes long, we'd get some big brother audio.  Absolutely.  That would be entertaining.  And just play a two-minute clip three times.  Eric doesn't even look at me to acknowledge I said that.  I know.  He's not even acknowledging it.  Hey, little rassles hat.  How'd you get 34 seconds?  Spanky.  Wait, I was going to praise you, but now I think I get to abuse you again.  All right.  Because, honestly, you know, Eric takes a lot of abuse, but he picks up a lot of things. 
[01:05:30]  He does.  Like, we were talking about Rick the Fag, whatever, from the song parody contest.  And he found the song that your brother did.  What a guy.  But it's supposed to be, what, 34 seconds long?  It's supposed to be 34 seconds.  This says six minutes and 22 seconds.  What?  I don't know where the other end from came.  We'd love nothing more than to spend every day over the next three months, said you.  We can't, because we'll be in the studio laying down the album.  They're all laughing.  What is this?  What is this?  I have no idea.  I don't know what that is.  But we do have a really good mate and friend here, Dave Navarro. 
[01:06:00]  Dave Navarro.  I think this is, what's his name?  Let's help throw the phone at the guy.  What?  What is this?  Look at Ben.  He's loving this.  Ben loves his music.  Is that Russell Crowe?  It was a previously existing, evolved machine, like that of In Excess.  And I had to walk in.  Richard the Naked Fag, bud.  It's the In Excess reality show.  Oh, that one?  He went to get, he found the Richard, the song that made Howard's contest.  That's what he went to burn, but obviously it came out wrong. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah, but he burned the wrong track.  Six minute epic.  Eric always looks exasperated.  You know, this is wrong.  He just like puts his hands out like he, and his orange shirt with gray sleeves.  And the booth laughs hysterically.  I was back in the office.  I was back in the office.  As soon as that started, the amount of laughter that came out so loud out of that booth that  you could hear it all the way back in the office.  They love when Eric fucks up.  They love it.  They certainly do.  You know, they're all just sitting there waiting to take his place.  You know what Eric's wardrobe needs?  A gas can and a match. 
[01:07:00]  We got to chip in and get this kid a couple of shirts that don't belong on a five-year-old.  He is dressed like Spanky McFarlane today.  Every fucking shirt he has should come with a lollipop and an incest survival story.  One of those huge lollipops.  Just a big lolly and a hat with a propeller on it.  You have to put him in knickers one of these things just to skip around.  Oh, too funny.  Well, I don't know about something like that.  That's kind of racist.  But I mean, I...  Oh, I bet.  No, short pants.  Oh, okay. 
[01:07:30]  Bill needs coffee.  You need coffee?  Bill needs coffee.  Oh, I got a nice...  All right.  Eric Getz, retarded child clothes.  Don't make a fucking good dresser out of me.  Hey, Ben, I'm trying to stall.  Does he have the song you think?  Where is he?  Go get him.  Give me a thumbs up or down.  Oh, he's waving you off.  He's waving me off.  He just waved you off.  That blows.  Go around.  Go around.  Well, it was that song, and then he did...  Joe did a cover of Everlong.  It was a Foo Fighters.  There was Howard, you fucking Jew, or something like that.  It was something offensive. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, it's really offensive.  That's classic.  All right, well, XMTV Commercial Outtakes.  We could listen to this as we go break.  All righty, then.  This is five minutes long, though.  We'll just take a quick listen.  Oh, I got a tinkle lope, so I mean, maybe the neighbor from Less Than Zero can take your  food order or whatever, and then we can go to break and take a leak.  Oh, man, I want in on that one, but I don't care.  What's his name?  He just looks like every guy from Less Than Zero.  What's your name again?  Mike.  Frank.  Mike.  That's the Mike one. 
[01:08:30]  Yes.  It's the Mike unit.  It's the one that looks like the other guy, but your name's Mike.  Right.  Right.  You're the unshaven version.  Yes.  Strapping.  All right.  We got to get Gary Busey clips for tomorrow.  Oh.  Ah.  How long have you been about to make it?  It's the L.A. cap.  Yes.  Got a note.  Song file corrupted.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  All right, Eric's working on that.  So, do you ever want to be on radio, or what are you...  Sure, yeah.  All right, enough.  Enough, enough.  Broadcast journalism major. 
[01:09:00]  Fascinating.  Absolutely.  In a burger.  Good place.  Yep.  I go to Hofstra.  Cool.  Jet train there.  Yes, they do.  Yes, they do.  Big Joe Klecko fan, are you?  No, I'm a Giants fan.  Good boy.  Good boy.  I hate that.  Do you do a lot of sightseeing around the neighborhood out there?  Not really, no.  Not at Hofstra.  Oh, isn't it a wonderful neighborhood?  Uniondale, right?  No, it's not.  It's well on the border of Uniondale.  They say they're in Garden City, but they're not.  Yeah.  Oh, that's wonderful.  It's not a nice area.  That is a great place to go if you want your gold chain snatched at gunpoint. 
[01:09:30]  Go to class and just hightail at home.  Don't even fucking stop for red lights.  Did you grow up in Long Island?  Yes, I did.  What part of Long Island?  Rockville Center.  Rockville Center.  Just getting to know them a little bit, Opie.  True.  It's fun, too.  Why is he still talking?  I have no idea.  I don't remember what answer he said.  How long have you gone to Barnard?  CW Post?  Jesus.  Thank you, Mike.  No problem.  All right, Mike.  Mike, is it?  Yeah, Mark.  How long have you been working here? 
[01:10:00]  About a month now.  Oh, boy.  A little less.  All right.  Here we go.  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony spreading the ONA virus nationwide on XM Satellite Radio.  There's no salve for this.  That's awful.  Radio that's real, honest, and funny.  If by that I mean dishonest, sarcastic drivel, then you're right.  Unpredictable, unleashed, unruly, and we're back.  Unwashed, unkempt, unslept.  He's got nothing. 
[01:10:30]  I got fucking nothing.  There's zero.  Zero coming through on this.  These are my lines from the last fucking recording.  Ugh.  Like sand through the hourglass, so is the ONA virus.  I like it as much as the next guy.  This is really funny stuff.  Yeah, we, uh.  But are we now alleging that this is Pat O'Brien?  I miss it.  I miss it playing him as well.  We just got out.  I miss it playing it?  Yeah, but he can't play him like we're playing him.  Yeah, I got to edit all the fun stuff out. 
[01:11:00]  You just imagine.  A bunch of bleeps and bloops.  Right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Here's Pat O'Brien talking about a boop job.  That stinks.  Wish I was on that.  Satellite.  Satellite.  I'm no dummy.  Oh, sorry.  Don't talk to me like that.  I'm Nymus.  Yeah, yeah.  Satellite.  You were right.  I'm a dick.  Boy, I like to eat your pussy.  You can't.  Suck in my cock.  I'll lick your tits.  Yeah, yeah, baby. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah, so just wink at me when I'm walking by.  If I tip my cowboy hat at you, it means I want to fuck you.  I'm a cinnamon boy.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Jesus, dude, that's a really good impression.  When I have my, look, I want to jiggle my turkey neck at you.  All right, look, I'm going to teabag you. 
[01:12:00]  And my testes hang real low because I'm an old man.  And if you want that, just wink at me, baby.  Because I want to lick that pussy and suck those tits, baby.  Baby!  Bobby Worms coming to get you.  I want to do a Billy Saul Hargis fit while you suck my cock.  Bobby Worms coming to get you out of my pants.  Bobby and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  All right, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony program. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, could someone take this inquirer away?  I want to look at Beyonce's big fat ass.  This is probably one of the best issues ever.  They do that one every summer.  Best and worst beach bodies. 
[01:13:00]  And the whole cover is just messes.  And they're not showing their faces because they want you to buy the magazine and open it up.  And you've got to guess who these people are.  Beyonce's ass is giant.  She has a huge fat ass.  It's awful.  But they, you know...  Looks like she sat down in a gravel driveway.  Oh!  It looks like two people sat in a gravel driveway.  That is a giant ass.  Each cheek of her ass is a normal person's ass cheek. 
[01:13:30]  It's massive.  Full ass.  It's great.  It's the cellulite addition.  Yeah.  Oh, and Donatella Versace.  Oh, looks like she's melting.  Her ass is melting right off of the back of her body.  Yeah, great issue.  But I can't look at it anymore.  It's very distracting.  Well, we could spend a minute on this and then move on.  But big article in the New York Post today.  Jeans on the rise.  And I say, no! 
[01:14:00]  What do they mean?  It's the greatest, greatest style ever invented.  The low-rise jeans, yes.  The low-rise jeans.  With the thong pulled up.  The greatest fashion statement ever.  I used to be an ass man, a boob man.  But then when these jeans started getting lower and lower, I became a midriff man.  Remember when...  It's all about the midriff.  When we used to go to lunch at N.E.W. when the craze first took off, and three of the 
[01:14:30]  four men sitting there would see one of these girls, and we'd all be drooling.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, when these jeans...  Jennifer, me, you, Ken Stevens, Jeremy.  Right.  And three of those people would be drooling over the woman wearing the low-rise and the  thong.  And one of them...  One would be admiring her shoes.  And one of them would just keep talking about business.  Radio business.  Like, wow, what?  Oh, wow, I see what's going on here. 
[01:15:00]  See that over there?  No?  And I keep holding my pens here because they get messy.  But anyway, jeans on the rise, Anthony.  Jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep.  I'm trying to eat my sushi.  Do you want me to submit your contract?  Jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep.  When this style first hit, I think we've all just lost our minds.  Yeah, this is...  We couldn't believe that this was going on, where girls were wearing jeans barely above  their pubic hair.  Their pubis.  Pubis. 
[01:15:30]  Or where the pubic hair is supposed to go.  Yeah.  Well, guess what?  They're starting to go back up.  Yeah, they say this is out now.  Plumber's butt looks get flushed.  I don't think it's plumber's butt when it's on a hot girl.  No, not at all.  I've seen some blatant abuses of this privilege, though, on some chicks.  Well, yeah.  If you're wearing the low-rise jeans, there should not be the bread pan fat.  You know, when you cook the bread and it comes over the side of the pan, that should not be 
[01:16:00]  coming over the side of those low-rise jeans.  Absolutely not.  You ever notice that most of the girls that wear the juicy sweats, there's nothing juicy  about them?  Not a juicy thing about them.  Juicy in a cottage cheese sense.  Yeah, when you see juicy written on the ass and just looking, that isn't juicy.  If you're wearing something that says juicy on it, there should be a little juice.  Ugh.  Juicy is just awful. 
[01:16:30]  I like looking at, like, 12-year-old girls wearing those things.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What parent in their right mind allows their little girl to wear some of those things?  It says juicy or playa on their ass.  Right.  I think your kid's 12.  I know.  You gotta thank Britney Spears for that.  Yeah.  Making all that fashionable.  So now it's out?  What's coming in?  Oh, they're just moving it up a little bit. 
[01:17:00]  Moving it up?  Why?  They're moving it up a little bit.  I'm not gonna go back to those 70s pants that used to come up to the girls' belly buttons.  And then you can see the pantyhose over the top of them.  You can see pantyhose over jeans.  And, you know, the box just smells like an awful pile of sauerkraut with an armpit wrapped around it.  Yuck.  I said each cheek of her ass looks like a normal person's ass cheek.  And then I said a normal person's ass.  I fucked up.  That could go on the fuck up reel, but I did screw up. 
[01:17:30]  Bombs and flubs.  I happen to like when a girl bends over and you can see if she's turtling.  Those are the type of jeans I want.  Yeah, so they're on the rise, and we're hoping they don't go back to the mom jeans.  Yeah.  My favorite fake commercial of all time on SNL.  Yeah, mom jeans with the big, like, pleated front.  It had pleats for the extra room for the bunt that moms have.  And then the ass, there was so much extra material by the seams that run down the sides of the ass 
[01:18:00]  that it came out like motorcycle cop pants.  Oh, horrible jeans on horrible bodies.  Uh-oh.  What's the matter, Opie?  What's the matter, Opie?  He just grabbed his coffee cup.  Star of the show doesn't like something.  And through the sense of touch, he knows something's wrong.  Please, was there a witness in here?  Is there a, what did you say?  An iced coffee.  Did you say iced coffee?  It's 95 degrees out. 
[01:18:30]  No, you said tall.  You said tall, regular.  All right.  Rewind the tape.  Was it on the air?  No, it wasn't on the air.  Oh, shit.  Now we'll never know.  That's why I'm not sure.  Well, now you've got to blame the intern.  Are you arguing that he said...  I was very...  Wait, wait.  Let's run through this.  Let's run through it again.  Everyone knows I drank iced coffee.  Let's run through it again.  Opie gets a frosty beverage.  I don't think you understand.  Let's run through this again.  What did he say he wanted?  A tall, regular.  See, I'm still not hearing. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah, he's still mumbling something.  Yeah.  Wow.  I heard tall.  Maybe I was wrong.  I heard tall, regular.  That's why I'm praying that I had a witness so I could blast you.  No.  You probably said tall, regular.  He's probably right.  Well, I say that I drink nothing but iced coffee.  It's the middle of summer.  I know.  Take that back right now.  Tell the man to dump it back in the pot.  You want some iced coffee?  Tell him who it's for.  Quickly.  No, I'll drink it.  You're going to drink regular hot coffee now?  You're a multi-millionaire.  You shouldn't have to.  You're fancy, too. 
[01:19:30]  You're rich.  Really?  Could you please tell myself that?  I can't figure that one out yet.  I'll go get you a nice coffee if you want one.  No, I'll...  You'll suffer.  Pull the dust off the ATM card.  Check your balance every so often.  Have a little fun with your cash.  You really should.  Go to Atlantic City.  Take your buddy out on a trip.  Take old Jimmy out on a flight somewhere.  I finally got my checks.  My checks.  Now I can start writing checks again.  You can.  Start paying those bills.  All right.  Where were we?  Beyond your means. 
[01:20:00]  Low-rise jeans are getting higher.  In the 70s, they had, like, I guess the Jordache jeans that accentuated the ass,  but they came up to the girls' belly buttons.  The waistband was really high.  Did you say the girls' belly buttons?  The girls' belly buttons.  Yeah.  Were you talking about one girl, though?  No.  I was talking about, like, the girls that wore Jordache jeans.  The girl's belly button.  Or sassoon.  The girl's belly buttons.  Came up to the girls' belly buttons. 
[01:20:30]  I guess it works.  Remember Gold Digger jeans?  I had a crush on the girl.  There was a commercial where a blonde girl was Gold Digger, and the blonde girl who was  dancing for Gold Digger jeans I had a crush on.  I remember that.  Do you all right?  I don't remember that.  I remember the sassoon commercials.  It was sasson.  Sasson.  Ooh, la la, sasson.  And Jordache.  Jordache has the fit that's right.  The Jordache look.  Oh, wow.  My favorites were...  And they were just awful girls with huge hair and... 
[01:21:00]  Sportabouts.  If you never want pussy, again, sportabouts.  Sportabouts.  Wranglers.  And the W stands for Would You Like to Jerk Off Forever?  Wranglers.  Remember Bill Brady told a story once.  Habeel.  Cow Bill Bill.  When he was in here about when he...  For his birthday, I think it was, his mother got him jeans.  Because he wanted... 
[01:21:30]  I guess he wanted regular jeans that everyone had.  Like Levi's, you know?  The hip jeans to have at the time.  And his mom bought him jeans.  And they were Big Yank.  And it had a big brown patch on the back where you normally have the Levi thing.  But instead it said Big Yank.  Who told you this?  Mike Brady?  Big Yank.  And he said he just wouldn't wear it.  How do you wear something that says Big Yank to junior high or high school?  It's not getting goofed on. 
[01:22:00]  Did I ever tell you my jeans story?  When we were growing up, you know, the faded jeans were way in.  Yeah.  You get a nice pair of jeans in September for the school year.  And by May, they were just beat up and faded in.  Maybe a couple holes were happening.  Right?  I was never into those.  That was the fashion.  And my mom, to save some bucks because, you know, I'm a big family.  We got the jeans that never faded.  But I didn't know they never faded because I was stupid.  Like that navy denim the guy was talking about?  Yeah.  Well, now that style is back in for the women. 
[01:22:30]  A lot of women are wearing the jeans that don't fade.  Yeah.  But back in the day, it was all about getting the jeans.  They were nice, dark blue.  And slowly but surely, they would get lighter and lighter and frayed.  And it was just a thing to do, right?  Yeah.  Everyone had their jeans.  You'd wear them every day, whatever.  My mom bought the jeans that didn't fade to save, like, $1.50 probably.  Jesus.  And I wonder where I'd get it from.  And, uh...  And, uh...  I thought you just liked to walk everywhere. 
[01:23:00]  It's only 20 blocks.  What do you need a cab for?  Just walk.  You go right through Philly.  You're in D.C.  I'm the worst.  At least I know it.  So, uh...  But I didn't know they didn't fade, because I was just a little kid.  Yeah.  So I would be sneaking my jeans into the laundry every day, waiting for it to start fading.  Wouldn't happen.  And then when I realized they weren't going to fade, that was a very sad day.  So I was the only one in, like, uh, April that still had very, very dark, ridiculous jeans. 
[01:23:30]  I didn't like faded jeans when I was a kid.  I was one of those, like, anal kids that needed the, uh...  I liked blue jeans to look like they were still new.  Of course, Anthony.  No surprise there.  I know.  As you wear another shirt we've never seen before.  Yeah, you've seen this one, I think, right?  In a catalog.  Nice.  In a catalog, huh?  Yeah.  It's nice with the stripe.  It was in a catalog, but you couldn't really see it, because the guy's robe was covering most of it.  Shuffling in his matching slippers. 
[01:24:00]  Guys, we got to go to the phone.  John, for Tulsa, has a very good observation.  Go ahead, John.  Yeah, you know why they're doing away with the low rider weights, don't you?  Why?  Because the 70 Earth Mama Muff's coming back.  It is.  Yeah, they're going to start letting her grow wild again.  You know, I don't think I could ever go back to the 70s Earth Mama Muff.  If that style comes back, I think a lot of us are in deep trouble.  Why's that? 
[01:24:30]  I wouldn't like the big, giant muff.  I want none of it.  No, you don't like anything.  None of it.  I know, I know.  After you had the pleasure of a shave, do you?  Yeah.  It's a little bit down there.  Do you?  To let you know where you're at.  I might like a teeny bit if they go, wow, I've never had it here before.  That might be kind of hot.  Look, this just grew in yesterday.  Do you think the low risers are going away because the girls in general are going to start growing it back?  Because now you've got to cover up the area. 
[01:25:00]  You can't be walking around with half your muff hanging out.  There's an article, I only read a little bit of it.  It was on pubic hairstyles to match your body type.  They're saying that skinny girls shouldn't have that little strip because it makes them look even skinnier when they're naked.  They should have a more wider triangle.  Shut the fuck up.  I swear, and chubbier girls should have a very narrow strip to make them look slimmer.  Yeah, and it should go all the way up to their neck.  It should be called a stomach staple.  That should be the pubic style, you fatzos. 
[01:25:30]  Guys, this is a very interesting conversation.  Oh!  But we really got to break.  Look who's on the phone!  We really have to take a little sidestep here and say hi to our friend.  Hopefully he's still our friend.  I would hope so.  Boys, boys, boys.  Bruce Kelly, everyone.  Come on now.  Hi, guys.  Bruce Kelly, how are you doing, man?  I prefer the big, fat bush.  You like big 70s Earth Mama muffs?  You know.  Do you really, Bruce?  The bigger the fro.  Okay, okay.  They bring a tear to your eye, I guess.  The crying thing. 
[01:26:00]  Bruce.  Hey, by the way, the mixes were great.  I love the mixes.  We only have one so far.  We thought the listeners would come up with a few more for us.  But, you know what, I don't matter where shit, so that's what it is.  Oh.  We had to ask, too, what was it, because we weren't too sure from the audio, what was it  that actually got you on the video screen with Black Panther?  All right.  You know, you guys.  Wait, can we play, you know, just to set up the bit for the new listeners, because we're  getting new listeners every day.  This is Bruce Kelly.  He thinks we hate him, but actually, we don't hate him at all. 
[01:26:30]  He knows how to take a joke.  Can we play the audio of Bruce crying the whole thing?  He was at Live 8 in London.  He was watching The Who.  How far from the stage were you?  I was on the stage with The Who.  On the stage.  Right at the monitor board.  With The Who, right at the monitor board.  Great moment.  If you're a Who fan, that's unbelievable.  And he got a little emotional.  Here's the clip.  I know what it was, by the way.  Is this live?  Yes, we're live.  Bruce, where were you, buddy? 
[01:27:00]  I was right up under the footogs.  You know, it's amazing watching Pete Townsend and Roger Daltrey perform these songs after  all these years and still have the full spirit of what they do under control.  I mean, you know, Townsend just continues to be an amazing guitar player.  I'm sorry.  I'm absolutely crying.  I can't help it.  I really can't.  This is no fake.  You know, the whole moment just kind of got to me with that video.  Yeah, the video was very powerful. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah, yeah.  That was...  This is very awkward.  I'm sorry.  It was just the Who.  You know, I can't help but be a 14-year-old kid out there with The Who.  That's it.  Sorry.  You were seeing them live.  I guess that was in color.  Yeah.  Yeah, they were live on stage, but the black and white was happening on the big screens  too, so...  Through you, Chase.  Wow.  So there's two more to go here at Hyde Park and the crowd... 
[01:28:00]  I'm like an idiot.  I'm sorry, really.  No, no.  It's just overwhelming.  That's what this...  You know, that really is what this is all about.  There are certain moments...  No, it's not.  No, it's not.  Poor George.  Dancing.  Poor George.  Bruce, Bruce.  Poor George is like going, so, the Who is...  Yeah, he's just, um, okay, Bruce, as we move along here...  Jesus Christ, Bruce.  It's a band.  Okay, I'm a tool.  I'm a pussy.  I want to know...  Why didn't Emma and George Taylor Morris just kick in the balls at that point, man? 
[01:28:30]  Because we were all beat.  We'd been on the air for 12 hours.  And, uh, you know...  We didn't want to let you off the hook.  Well, you know...  Hey, look, look, look.  Your real friends would not let you off the hook.  Of course not.  You guys don't.  You can act like a man.  What's wrong with you?  Hey, it's the Who.  It's on stage.  It's the rush.  So, Bruce, I've got to know the ins and outs of this whole thing.  You're standing on the stage.  Yeah.  You're watching the Who live.  You're looking up at the monitor.  They're showing what? 
[01:29:00]  I guess a black-and-white footage of the Who?  No, no.  There was a thing that they did during the synthesizer break.  And won't get fooled again.  And a little African kid is standing behind a, obviously, well-to-do family who's gorging themselves.  And he's in the background.  And, you know, that wasn't...  You know, that wasn't...  That wasn't so much the deal.  It's just that, look, it's the Who. 
[01:29:30]  And it does something to me.  Certain songs and certain groups.  And probably the Who's the only one.  Zeppelin.  Zeppelin doesn't do it to me.  But the Who, you're on stage with the Who.  You walk off stage with the Who, with the band.  It was, you know...  Now, so you felt yourself welling up, I guess.  Yeah.  And now you knew you had a talk on the air.  Sure.  Did you think maybe you should not say anything until you got your composure?  Or you just let it all out?  Not at all.  Let it out.  That's what radio's about.  Right, guys?  For better or for worse. 
[01:30:00]  For better or for worse.  I don't know about that.  Okay.  Are the crickets there?  I can't hear the crickets.  That was pretty brutal to listen to.  Now, when you listen back to it, were you cringing at yourself?  Look, you guys know I listen to you on my two-hour drive home and my two-hour drive in.  I hear all the replays.  And I'm laughing my ass off in the car, especially when Opie's hitting the instant replay.  And, you know, it was hilarious.  It was funny.  And I wish I hadn't have done it. 
[01:30:30]  Can we just play music for you and see if you're going to cry or not cry?  Yeah, go ahead.  Go, go.  Let's see what happens.  Play some Who songs.  Play some 80s songs.  That'll make me cry.  All right.  Pet Shop Boys.  Does that make you cry?  Yeah.  Play the John Travolta song, Let Her In Again.  I'm going to Let Her In.  Ooh.  Let me ask you, did you cry when you saw the video of the black kid behind that well-to-do  family because you thought he was going to go and steal something off the table?  Very emotional moment, thinking those well-to-do people will have to then call the cops.  They're just those nice people trying to have a meal and he's passing. 
[01:31:00]  Hey, you know why I was crying?  I was so happy to be out of the Washington building.  That's why.  It happens.  Yeah.  It gets a little nuts sometimes.  By the way, I'm coming up there tomorrow.  Ooh.  Oh, you'll be in New York.  Would you like me to bring one of your favorites by the studio?  DeeDee?  Rick Springfield.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Have Rick Springfield come on.  Yeah.  Talk about his days as Dr. Noah Drake on General Hospital.  I've got Rick Springfield.  I'll drag him down and then I go on tour with Journey for about nine days and I don't cry  with Journey. 
[01:31:30]  Oh, no.  Did you get to meet the who?  The wheel in the sky keeps on turning.  Who's crying now?  My Journey.  And here I am.  That's what they'll dedicate to Bruce.  Who's crying now?  I'm absolutely crying.  That's my theme song.  Hey, Jimmy, by the way, if you guys go to xm411.com, there's some great pictures there.  Jimmy will be jealous.  There's me with Paul McCartney on there.  Wow.  That's a biggie.  That is a biggie.  How starstruck were you meeting McCartney? 
[01:32:00]  I met him before and, you know, we were just doing an interview.  He's a very cool guy.  Madonna was an asshole and her security guards basically tackled me.  Why?  I would have, too, by the way.  Yeah, you know.  What happened?  What did you come running up to her or something?  No, I was there and I had the recorder and it was Friday sound check and I shoved it  in her.  You know, I just said, hey, Madonna, say something to America.  And there were like nine Nazis around her and kind of shoved me.  And, you know. 
[01:32:30]  Roughed you up a bit.  That's what you get.  But, you know, on the other hand, you got, you got, why?  That was so bizarre.  You had Kofi Annan, who I interviewed in a row.  Kofi Annan.  Is he kind of like Kofi Annan?  Whatever his name is.  And then Slash right after that.  So I got a picture of me slashing Kofi Annan.  That's pretty cool.  I got to be honest.  I'm definitely jealous.  Well, I knew you would be.  McCartney?  I know your proclivity for star-fucking.  Hey, dude, is he going to do an XM Confidential, McCartney? 
[01:33:00]  Kofi Annan?  No, not Kofi.  No, not Kofi.  Yeah, he's going to go in there and talk about how his son ripped off the United Nations  through Saddam Hussein's.  Oh, you mean McCartney?  Yeah.  You know, we talked about that.  And the funny thing is, is over there in London, not a lot of Brits really know about XM,  but all the stars.  I'm telling you guys, it's like you're on NBC.  All the stars know everything about it.  Really?  Yeah.  I can't believe that.  I'm absolutely crying.  I guarantee you none of them listen to this program. 
[01:33:30]  I wouldn't be so sure.  Although I could tell you the latest ratings.  Nah.  I don't care.  Latest ratings?  Hey, if you're famous and you're listening to us, give us a call now.  Yep.  There you go.  Hey, wait a minute.  Prozac has something for you, Bruce.  Go ahead, Prozac.  Certainly does.  I'm a big fan, Bruce.  Do me the biggest honor.  Cry with me, man.  Hey, Prozac.  Cry with me.  Cry with me.  Cry with me. 
[01:34:00]  Okay, punchline.  Bruce's number one fan checking in.  Yes, Bruce's number one fan.  I love these set-up calls.  No, they're not even...  We don't set up shit.  I mean, I know...  We choose where to go.  I know, I know.  Bruce's number one fan.  Go ahead.  Hi, Bruce.  Oh, hey, man.  What's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, Bruce.  I love you.  I love your shows.  You know what?  I can't even...  I'm going to the fucking dentist right now.  I'd rather listen to the drill than listen to your fucking voice.  Oh, jeez. 
[01:34:30]  Oh, dude.  And he played himself off as Bruce's number one fan.  Oh, he tricked us, Bruce.  I'm sorry.  Ass head.  You know...  By the way, congratulations.  You're ahead of fashion.  What now?  You're ahead of fashion.  It came out today that jeans are on the rise.  And you've been on...  Will you guys leave me alone with the pants?  You've been...  You're up to my chin.  I know it.  You've been on to that ever since we knew you, and now it's coming out today in the New  York Post that jeans are on the rise.  The plumber's butt is out. 
[01:35:00]  I'm a fat old disc jockey, and ever since I stopped cocaine years ago, the weight just  comes on.  When you talked to Paul McCartney, did he ask you how Ethel, Rick, and Lucy were?  Yeah, I heard you guys bitching about that the other day.  Hey, real quick.  The thing that Jim wrote for Geronimo's wife.  I was really glad to see that.  And that was very cool, and it's very cool that you guys...  You know, Whack Bag's a great place. 
[01:35:30]  Jim, what's going on?  Hey, I'm doing good, Jim.  Hey, listen to me.  Hold on, Jim.  That even made me uncomfortable, that hang up.  I saw him fishing around with the mouse.  I'm like, don't do it.  Oh, here he goes.  Bruce.  Did you hang up?  God, I hit the O.P. in the phone pot.  Yeah, I don't know what happened, Bruce.  Geez.  Jim, go ahead. 
[01:36:00]  Hey, I forgot to play Bruce's welcoming song that you guys made up.  Oh, yeah.  Have you heard your jingle yet, Bruce?  Go, go.  You haven't heard this yet?  Let's go, guys.  Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  He's leaving crying.  Hold on, Bruce.  You've got to listen to this.  Yeah.  Bruce Kelly's on the phone from far away, and we bet he's got nothing good to say.  This segment could be the world's biggest wreck.  Bruce Kelly's got his pants around his neck.  Let's all make a bet that Bruce Kelly will get hung up on again. 
[01:36:30]  Oh, that's great.  That's a Martini Steve creation.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, I take great pride in getting the abuse, really.  I heard you before you left for London.  I heard you, I think, on the 60s channel.  Yeah.  You were over there.  You brought some chick in there with you.  I don't remember.  Yeah, you're like the ambassador to the Washington building down there.  Hey, you know what I consider myself?  I consider myself the mayor of XM Satellite.  Yeah, we were saying that.  I know you did. 
[01:37:00]  Quite the mayor.  He's the guy that takes the initiative, and anybody new comes up, and Bruce will give you the lowdown.  Hey, Bruce, what about Cream?  They're getting back together.  You hung out with those guys, no?  Yeah, Madison Square Garden coming up.  You are terrible.  Oh, I honestly didn't see that one coming.  I'm thinking, how can I get a picture with Cream?  Right, dude.  Was Clapton in Cream?  Of course.  Of course he was.  How do you not want that picture?  You'd want that?  Hell yeah.  Clapton? 
[01:37:30]  That's a picture even I would want.  And I don't take pictures, celebrity pictures.  But Clapton's like, come on.  Well, I'll be getting, thanks to Sanctuary Records, Steve and I will be interviewing Geezer Butler and Tony Iommi.  Of Black Sabbath.  I'm so happy.  Dude, that is pretty cool.  Yeah, the interview will stink.  I'm awful at this.  But I'll do the best I can.  Hi, Tony.  What's up, Joe?  What's up, Joe?  Joe?  Hey, Joe.  The faggot get the Kleenex.  The faggot get the Kleenex. 
[01:38:00]  Wow.  Tony.  Oh, Jesus.  What awful timing.  Horrid timing on that one.  That 80s guy.  What's up?  Do-do.  Do-do.  Do-do.  Bruce Kelly.  Shit dick.  I'm in a park next to Laura Hobbs, breathing out of the 20 extra holes in your chest.  Shit dick. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, man.  I can't believe we actually sat through do-doos.  Do-doos.  I wanted to see where he was going.  I had to.  It paid off.  It definitely paid off.  All right.  Oh, God.  That's funny.  Holy shit.  That's funny.  Well, it's a mighty, uh...  Do we have a little something-something we could?  Mighty nights of Bruce to phone in, though.  A little something-something we could play going into break?  Did you ever read Harry Potter, Eric?  No.  Um, Pat from Monaki says he likes Bruce's let's-get-serious-for-a-moment downshift in tone. 
[01:39:00]  Like, he's talking and everything's fine.  And it was like, guys, I just want to say that you're the writings you did.  He's constantly on the air.  I know.  Although, that was on the air, wasn't it?  Yeah.  But we forget that this is actually being broadcast anywhere.  I think, like, what he does is radio.  You know, he's on the 80s channel, plays the songs, intros, and stuff, and that's radio.  This, I don't know what it is.  The name of this show should be Jerkoffs. 
[01:39:30]  You know what?  I've got to say, too.  We were talking today.  The 40s channel I don't listen to.  But I was right flipping around last night.  50s through 90s.  Every song I recognized.  It was great.  Yeah.  Well, that's why those channels are there.  Every one I liked.  I like the 60s, 70s, 80s.  Yeah.  90s has some song I like.  90s kind of, they play a little too much like En Vogue or something.  Right, right, right.  But Jim probably likes that.  Never Gonna Get It.  Never Gonna Get It.  Oh, yes.  Never Gonna Get It.  You like that, Jimmy?  I'm moving. 
[01:40:00]  I'm moving.  Yeah.  He's dancing in his head.  No, I don't like Never Gonna Get It at all.  No, I want to hear Children of the Grave.  Oh.  Acoustic.  Right.  No, I was just great last night.  Speaking of Bruce, I was listening to the 80s channel.  It's from Lionel Richie.  Gives you a lot to switch around with.  That's why I like the satellite.  It gives you a lot to switch around with.  And when you're switching, unlike when you're switching on regular stations, it's not commercials,  commercials, commercials, maybe the end of a song.  You just switch from song to song.  When does Air America start?  What is that on?  It's on.  It's on.  When did they start?  It's on.  Yesterday?  Oh.  Yeah.  Exclusive. 
[01:40:30]  It's the exclusive satellite carrier.  I thought...  XM Satellite Radio.  Did the series have them or no?  They never did.  Yeah, I think they did at some point.  Oh, they lost it?  Yeah.  Good.  Well, then we have the commies now.  They would rather have a skateboard show.  That's got to be good.  We're here again at the Great Wall of China.  We get it.  Yeah, that must have been a big moment for the Skateboarding Channel.  Oh, who cares?  All right, we're going to go to break with the little Donna Summer thing.  We haven't played this in a while.  Donna Summer.  Some fat pig called our show and she was trying to win Donna Summer tickets. 
[01:41:00]  They used to...  She got the wrong radio station.  She got the wrong number, yeah.  So we fucked with her.  Am I the right caller?  What were you calling for?  Donna Summer tickets.  Donna Summer tickets.  Are you a big Donna Summer fan?  Yes, but I'm more of a .5 fan.  Oh, boy.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Let me tell you something.  Uh-huh.  You're going to see Donna Summer.  You're kidding.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  Matter of fact, we're going to put you in the front row. 
[01:41:30]  Absolutely.  For Donna Summer.  What do you say?  I don't believe it.  Thank you very much.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  Hey, what color panties are you wearing?  I'm wearing a bathing suit.  Donna Summer wants to know.  What kind of bathing suit are you wearing?  A one-piece, a thong, bikini?  A bikini.  I'm suntanning.  Suntanning.  And by my pool is my radio with f***ing point five on.  Oh, boy.  She says it again.  Look at that.  Since she's mentioned the station so many times, I think another prize is in order. 
[01:42:00]  You like the disco era?  Yes, I do.  The whole disco dancing thing?  Absolutely.  How about a disco weekend in Las Vegas, Nevada?  Yeah!  That's right.  You'll be whisked away to Las Vegas, Nevada to see Donna Summer in Las Vegas.  Are you serious?  We are serious.  I can't believe this.  You just have to tell us one thing.  What?  What's the strangest object you've ever used during sex?  The what?  Donna wants to know. 
[01:42:30]  Nothing.  You're a virgin.  No.  You're a big, fat virgin.  Yeah!  You're a big, fat virgin.  And what's your favorite station?  25.  She said it again.  Yeah!  You know what you're going to win now?  What?  A trip on the space shuttle.  Yeah!  The first person in space.  You're going to see Donna Summer on the space shuttle.  Isn't this fantastic?  Oh, this is wonderful.  Have you ever been on the space shuttle? 
[01:43:00]  No, I haven't.  Have you?  Oh, it's beautiful.  Yes!  Fantastic.  It's going to have a big disco ball.  Mm-hmm.  They're going to decorate it all.  Hey, do you know how to dial a phone?  Yes.  What's your favorite sexual position?  Hello?  Donna wants to know.  Hello?  Oh, no.  Did she hang up finally?  She's gone.  Oh, my God.  It took forever.  And so I'm talking to him, and I'm like, well, just go ahead.  Give me your cock.  And he's like, I don't know if I should.  Jim. 
[01:43:30]  Stop.  That old gag.  Jesus.  Like my acting?  Jim.  Like I was concerned.  Jim.  Both of you acting suck.  My acting is very good.  Yeah, Jim's acting is good.  Dude, I'm looking the other way.  Call me.  Jim?  What?  My motivation, man.  Everything's got to be full of emotion.  My motivation was there.  I wanted to see who was calling me.  Yeah.  We were going to break, but.  You said watch.  Hate the game, not the player.  But Ben found Madonna blowing off Bruce Kelly at Live 8.  Get out of here.  I've never heard of this. 
[01:44:00]  I have no idea what it's going to sound like.  So let's listen to it together here live on the show.  Go.  Oh.  Donna, Bruce Kelly from XM Satellite Radio.  Would you like to say something to the USA, please?  Pray for no rain.  Thank you very much.  Have a great show.  Ugh.  He was getting ushered away.  What a self-righteous cunt.  Bore.  Yeah, exactly.  She knew the mic was the word.  Pray for rain?  What is she?  Pray for no rain. 
[01:44:30]  She's insane, that woman.  Wait, can I hear that again?  She's a crazy woman with a fake English accent.  Well, Bruce said that, yeah, he got pretty much tackled by her people.  But she sees that the mic's live, so she knows she has to do something or it's going  to be a big story that she was an asshole.  Yep.  So, listen again.  Yes, sir.  You hear him getting pushed.  Yeah.  You hear Bruce getting pushed.  Thank you, Ben, for that.  Yeah.  Run back in again.  Smash your face at my dick.  Donna, Bruce Kelly from XM Satellite Radio.  Would you like to say something to the USA, please? 
[01:45:00]  Pray for no rain.  Thank you very much.  Have a great show.  Thank you very much.  He's being pushed.  Yeah, that's because he's getting pushed away.  What a self- what a- what a- just a douchebag she is.  A douche.  I would like to say.  Shut up.  You're from Michigan.  Shut up.  You and your mediocre husband.  Stupid.  All right.  And how many guys does it take to push Bruce Kelly?  Jesus, they must be strong men.  I'm going to use one of the bulldozers.  Yeah, they just all pushed him at his belt line.  Five men pushing him below the chin at his belt. 
[01:45:30]  They wanted to grab him by his belt and the scruff of his neck and throw him off stage,  but they were both in the same place.  Grab it with one hand.  They had to grab belt scruff and sock.  Bruce is always wearing knickers accidentally because he pulls them up so high.  I really want to bullwhip the bottom of his calves.  Straighten them right out.  Tony, what's up?  He's just so sleeves on where his pockets are on his pants. 
[01:46:00]  You can just put his arms through there.  He always looks like he's doing a headstand of some sort.  A mess.  Tony, what's up?  Hey, I just want to tell you, boys, you need to hurry up to go to a break because those  my five faggots are going to have a meltdown.  That's true.  We've got to figure that out.  Pray for no rain.  When we go out like an hour without a break, it sucks for the my fires, unfortunately.  As Rick Springfield is on Good Morning America, I guess.  We get to talk to Rick tomorrow.  What was the big song?  He'll bring Rick Springfield in. 
[01:46:30]  Bruce is in.  Jessie's Girl.  Yeah.  I'm in love with Jessie's Girl.  Oh.  Jesus.  Look at the old chicks.  Look at this.  What is he singing?  What is he doing with this song?  Isn't this 10CC or something like that?  Mansford Man?  He has a new album.  Big boys don't cry, Bruce.  Who sang this originally?  I think it's Mansford Man.  Wow.  Who's that androgynous creature? 
[01:47:00]  Is it?  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  Don't forget it.  Just nothing.  It's just a silly face.  I'm going to.  His voice is shot.  And just because.  Oh.  This is awful.  I'll call you up.  Why is he sick?  Don't get me wrong.  Don't think you've got it late. 
[01:47:30]  Wow, that is sad.  I'm not alone.  Look at these women in their, like, 40s, early 50s.  Look at that woman in the front row wanting, needing.  All smiling, getting damped.  Jesus.  Yeah, he's looking right back at you, honey.  Yeah.  That was awful.  You must be sick.  If you have laryngitis, you shouldn't be performing.  Someone help us out.  Who did that song originally?  I think it was, I'm going to go with 10cc.  You're going with 10cc?  Yeah.  Find it, Hawk. 
[01:48:00]  What are you doing?  What are you doing over there fucking around looking at pictures?  Manford Man?  I don't think.  I thought it was, like, Manford Man's last.  Right down.  Oh, no.  No, no, the other one.  What are you doing?  Up one.  No, down.  Right there.  Hawk.  Dude, it's right in front of you.  For Pete's sake.  Dude.  I'm starts with I, and you're in the H's.  There you go.  That's right.  Yeah, click on that.  Who does it?  Silly goose.  All right.  Where's the artist?  Where's the artist? 
[01:48:30]  Classic rock that really doesn't rock.  10cc on the wolf.  Or the bear?  10cc.  Or on the panda.  You're listening to the panda.  10cc.  I'm not in love.  All right.  10cc is actually the amount of the male ejaculation is where they got their name from.  Along with the Lovin' Spoonful got their name from the same thing because it's a tablespoon full of jizz. 
[01:49:00]  That's something you can explain on regular radio.  No.  You've got to love this satellite.  Eagle.  Want to redo the intro with that fine part?  Those back toys.  Man, but if you're going to cover a song, you've got to make it sound...  As good as the original.  Yeah.  Well, his voice is shit.  I'm absolutely crying here.  It's 10cc.  All right.  Hi, hi. 
[01:49:30]  Derek, get us out of here, please.  This channel is experiencing technical difficulties.  Please stand by.  We're working on the problem.  Technical difficulties.  Probably just faulty equipment.  Or Ben's hog hit the circuit breaker and tripped it.  Steve poured a martini in the mixing board.  Or Hulk's breath burnt through the transmission cord.  Sandy Kane blocked the sky with Twado.  Or Bob Kelly vomited all over the console.  Or Howard Stern bought XM for half a billion.  Or Pat from Unaki drove his van through the building. 
[01:50:00]  What's the meaning?  The scene three messages are repeating.  The only way to fix it is a corporate meeting.  And Opie's not around.  He's rollerblading in the park.  And Professor Anthony can't even get it to start.  It's taking forever.  I hope it don't last long.  Like Stalker Patty crawling with a crusty mask on.  Or maybe Danny told Ricky to stop the show.  Or Opie threw a chocolate strawberry at ELO.  The show.  The show. 
[01:50:30]  All right.  What a panic that that is.  Why?  Just.  I know.  You know, apparently someone blew a tire somewhere.  Don't, there's a Paris attack.  What?  We have a lot to do here today, guys.  We haven't done anything.  Not much going on in the news.  Ah, well, it's a big story, actually.  The Howard Beach thing.  Oh, yeah.  We should jump on that a little bit.  Howard Beach victim busted for armed robbery. 
[01:51:00]  That's shocking.  Yeah.  This is very shocking.  I didn't expect this now.  Because these were just fine young gentlemen that were walking around Howard Beach at 3.30 in the morning.  These three black guys.  They were wandering around the neighborhood and they got beat up pretty bad.  One of them got beat up pretty bad.  The other two made off.  Right.  And, you know, now everyone's yelling and screaming, hate crime, hate crime, hate crime.  Yep.  But, Fat Nick there was claiming at the time that they were looking at his gold chains and stuff, right? 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, put a screwdriver up to him, held him against a wall and demanded his gold chains.  And this is what Fat Nick said these three did to him earlier in the day.  And that spurred his attack later on.  Not the fact that they were black guys, but, you know, they're in the neighborhood trying to rob them.  He's going to get a little retribution, a little justice.  Well, a friend who was chased with Howard Beach beating victim, whatever his name was, 
[01:52:00]  during an alleged racial attack has been busted for robbing a terrified teen at gunpoint, cops said yesterday.  Richard Wood, whose black friend was beaten by a white man in Queens neighborhood last month,  ripped a gold chain off his 18-year-old victim as an accomplice cocked a loaded pistol on a subway train Sunday in Brooklyn.  They said, give me your money.  He thought they were joking.  Then they pointed the gun at his head, the victim's shaken mom said. 
[01:52:30]  He told them, I have no money.  So they tried to take his new sneakers, but he wouldn't let them have.  What asshole doesn't give up his sneakers with a gun pointed at his head?  Usually the dead asshole in the story.  Holy shit, what a dummy.  Give him the sneakers, whatever you want.  Take it away.  The thieves made off of the boys $375 gold chain, a bus ticket, his wallet, which contained $10,  his learner's permit, and an ATM card.  There you go.  Nick should have killed this piece of shit with that baseball bat.  That's right. 
[01:53:00]  One law enforcement source said,  Woods bust Sunday for alleged swiping a gold chain could wind up supporting the Howard Beach suspect's contention.  Ding.  And blow apart the case's hate crime angle.  Yeah, I think he could get off on this now, Fat Nick.  Good.  I think this is, unless of course these asshole lawyers get involved and don't allow this to be put into his case.  Hopefully it shows a pattern of behavior, but if they'll say it happened after, it's irrelevant, of course. 
[01:53:30]  Uh-huh.  He's a fucking criminal, and he should have got his head cracked with a bat.  Yeah, you know, they were walking around this all-white neighborhood, 3.30 in the morning, they said, admittedly, looking to steal a car.  And some white guys came along and beat the shit out of him.  Oh, well, it happens.  And like we said before, if it was three white guys in the wrong part of town, and they were trying to do something a little shady, even not, if they were just walking around, they'd get their asses handed to them, too. 
[01:54:00]  And it would never make the papers a hate crime.  It wouldn't be a hate crime.  It probably wouldn't make the papers.  It's a hate crime, no.  Well, this just goes to show you the caliber of victim that is involved in this story.  These aren't victims.  These are criminals that got roughed up by some people in the neighborhood that didn't want that element in their town.  Yep.  That's what this is.  This isn't a hate crime.  This is community watch, is what I like to call it, with a Louisville slugger. 
[01:54:30]  All right.  This isn't a college, you know, three college-bound kids walking through the neighborhood.  And this proves it.  I wonder when the other asshole's going to get arrested.  Puts a gun in your face.  Give me your sneakers.  Yeah.  He's a valued member of society.  He's going to amount to something.  Reverend Al, go ahead.  Where's Reverend Al?  Where is he?  Come on, Reverend Al.  Get out there.  Protect the rights of the victim.  The victim was a Hispanic in this robbing. 
[01:55:00]  Of course, it doesn't count that.  Just a minority robbing a minority.  I guess that's expected.  Screw it.  It's expected.  Yeah.  But when Whitey, who is so superior, does things, that's not expected of them, so they  must be a prosecutor.  Fucking Bernie Getz, even though he freaked out on this show, is still a hero, and you  shot those vermin, and you know what?  They were fucking criminals, and you should have killed all four of them.  God knows how many lives he saved.  He was just a bad shot.  God knows how many lives he saved in the future.  There are people walking around that might have been dead or permanently fucked up from 
[01:55:30]  being raped or something, that he didn't give these guys the chance to do it.  One of them did rape a pregnant woman on a rooftop after that.  Exactly.  They're just awful.  Yeah.  Awful.  Well, this guy also, Richard Wood, he called up the hate crimes division, got one of the  cops on the phone and said, look, can you help me out on this case I've just been arrested  on?  Look, I helped you guys out.  Now help me.  So he's trying to parlay this whole hate crime thing into getting them off the hook for 
[01:56:00]  this crime that he committed.  Just a waste of life.  Scumbag.  Waste of life that's going to amount to nothing.  And unfortunately, he wasn't one that tripped as they were running.  Puts a gun in somebody's face.  Give me your sneakers.  Sneakers.  Ugh.  And then he left the scene, changed his clothes, and then he was identified by the victim.  The cops drove him around.  And like a great scene out of Cops, he's there arguing with the cops that it couldn't be 
[01:56:30]  him because he's wearing different clothes.  How brilliant is that one?  Wow.  You know how cops question people.  They don't say, we had a guy that fits your description, and then tell him what he was  wearing, and you're not wearing the same clothes.  But this guy said, they don't talk like that.  Cops always try to trip you up.  So they probably say, we have a guy that matches your description.  Wait, but I'm wearing different clothes.  You know, these friggin' morons.  Well, because you panic. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  But if you can't match my description, I'm wearing different clothes.  Oh, really?  All right.  In other news, Anthony.  Yes.  Wife cleared in sleigh after butt insult.  Hmm.  Listen to this story.  A Brooklyn newlywed who claimed beatings caused her to snap and stab her husband to death  after he complained about the size of her butt was acquitted yesterday of manslaughter.  Manslaughter, huh?  Judy, 29, burst into tears when she heard a judge say there wasn't enough evidence to 
[01:57:30]  convict her in the May 11, 2003 death of Jason.  Not enough evidence to convict her?  Her husband of only three weeks.  Wow.  So it wasn't that he was on her side for doing it.  I guess he felt there wasn't even enough evidence?  No.  The dead man's family wept outside the courtroom following the conclusion of the two-week bench  trial.  Castillo Thomas testified that the pair long had a stormy relationship.  Charging Thomas choked her so hard that sometimes she would pass out. 
[01:58:00]  On May 11th, she said her husband attacked her as she was on the computer hours after  an earlier fight in the Cypress Hill home.  The beating was accompanied by taunts that she was too skinny.  Skinny?  I thought that she was too fat.  That's what I thought.  And her buttocks were too small, she said.  She said she grabbed the knife and tried to escape, but he trapped her at the door, lunging  at her.  All of a sudden, the knife got short.  Prosecutors argued the blade wound was no accident because it penetrated. 
[01:58:30]  It's six inches deep in a downward motion.  Oh, this story stinks.  Yeah.  I thought it was a fat ass.  We really got to start preparing for the show better.  We got to read these a little better.  I think we should start reading.  Because, you know, we saw the headline like, wow, wife cleared and slayed after butt insult.  We're thinking, you know, some fat woman out there eating a little too much.  The husband abuses her about her fat butt, and then she gets pissed and stabs him.  That's a good story.  That's a really good story.  This story is, eh.  This story is, eh.  Eh. 
[01:59:00]  It's funnier if she's got a fat ass.  Definitely.  I don't know why.  I agree more with this guy, actually.  I hate a skinny dumper.  Yeah?  Good for him.  I told you I want that ass a little fatter.  Fill that out.  Fill that ass out.  Rabs that neck.  Just squeezes that little chicken neck.  See, Hank really looks at her flat ass in the mirror.  Good boy.  Don't tolerate any of that little skinny, hiney bunk.  All right.  Well, Hogan.  Hogan knows best. 
[01:59:30]  Ah, right.  Reality show with Hulk Hogan.  This show had potential, but I don't know.  I think I'm going to bail on this show.  And I like these reality shows.  Yeah.  Like I said earlier, Surreal Life, Celebrity Fit Club 2.  Make sure we get the Gary Busey audio.  I just like his music.  I watch the faggiest reality shows.  I'm just thinking about it.  I watch the stupid cooking one.  People, they're cooking.  And then I watch the stupid nanny one.  Ugh.  I watch the nanny 911.  Because the animal kids are hysterical. 
[02:00:00]  I don't like the end.  I could turn it off at the last ten minutes when everything, once again, is fine.  And there's no problems anymore.  And their little animal kids are now perfect little gentlemen and ladies.  That's stupid Hollywood.  It's all done with the editing.  That's stupid Hollywood.  Even with reality shows, they've got to wrap up everything nice with a bow at the end of it.  That's what they do.  The kids all of a sudden listen.  And meanwhile, they were animals.  And that's the fun part of the show, is watching kids cursing.  They've got to pixelate their mouths and bleep them out. 
[02:00:30]  But the kids are telling their parents, fuck you.  And the little, like, six, seven-year-old kids cursing their parents out, pissing all over the house.  You know, these do-gooders out there, you make a good point, because that's the latest thing, where they block out the mouths.  Yeah.  It used to be, obviously, no cursing, and they would just bleep it.  So then you, as a viewer, would go, oh, there's a curse.  And you could read their mouths and go, wow, he just said motherfucker.  Yeah.  Or whatever.  But now they're blocking out the mouths, because they think that's going to help the situation.  You still, as a viewer, knows that there's some cursing going on there. 
[02:01:00]  And you could fill in your own blanks.  And there is absolutely no FCC regulations that say you have to fog out the mouth of someone cursing.  Well, I could think, let's go back to Janet Jackson.  Eh.  You know, now everyone has got to be...  Super sensitive.  Super careful and all that.  I wonder if people actually complained that I didn't hear it, but you could read his lips, and he said a bad word.  Of course they did. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah.  I fault the faggot companies that don't have one ounce of balls to just stand up and go, look, this is not right, we're not paying these fines.  And you know what?  The fact that, like, satellite radio and cable are kicking the shit out of you, good.  That's what you deserve.  Cowards.  Is that moron from Emmys?  Did you read that whole article?  How he's saying that the impact of satellite radio is greatly overblown.  And podcasting and internet and everything, everything all together, is so overblown as how it's going to interfere with the radio and take away from radio's audience. 
[02:02:00]  That is someone who is just blind.  Blind.  You could say it's not going to be as big a success as some people think it's going to be.  It's all speculative right now, you know, as to how successful it's going to be.  It's successful already.  It's here.  How big it gets, only the future's going to tell.  But to say it's not going to have any impact, you're, what can I say, putting your head in the sand.  I was going to say. 
[02:02:30]  That's a good one.  I was going to say delusional.  Delusion.  Delusional.  It sounds like he's blowing a bunch of smoke.  Ah, right.  And XM Satellite Radio, they understand the growth of some of these other things, and we're getting involved with that, too.  Of course.  People are listening to our show right now on the internet.  Yep.  That they are.  Where are they?  Well, Anthony, I wanted to play the Hogan Knows Best audio, but I don't know.  I think there might be a problem with this disc, too.  Uh-oh.  Who brought this to the table?  What's the problem? 
[02:03:00]  It won't queue up, Opie?  Well, it's one.  That's what they say in the business.  It's one track that's eight minutes long.  One track, eight minutes long.  And who did that?  And I got the track listings, and I got seven tracks here.  Who did it?  Sam.  Oh, no.  Get that fucking fetus in here.  Uh-oh.  Sam was in charge of cutting that one up?  Wait a minute.  Why?  Hold on.  Before everyone laughs and thinks it's funny.  Right.  Why is Sam doing that?  We just hired a bunch of guys.  He wanted to contribute. 
[02:03:30]  Oh, did he volunteer his services?  You volunteered.  Yeah.  It's a data disc.  So it's...  Because the other...  I got sound bites for movies and stuff.  I assume that everything needed to be in WAV format.  Assumed.  Yes.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  I'll make an audio disc.  Oh, boy.  Holy crap, guys.  That's...  Oh, boy.  Now...  Now you've done it.  No, Sam has nothing to do with it.  Sam doesn't know any better. 
[02:04:00]  Sam's an intern.  And he's trying to help out the program.  I respect that.  He...  But now he volunteered for the service.  Yeah.  Did you say, hey, I want to do this?  Well, I said I had the Hogan show on the computer because I took audio out of The Aviator  and a couple other movies for Steve for production.  Yeah.  And he needed those in WAV specifically.  So I went and took the Hogan audio out of WAV because...  Oh, boy.  I thought that's just how all audio was taken out.  He didn't know.  He's new.  He didn't know. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah, but someone has to make sure all this is set and ready to go when we enter the studio.  Welcome to the club, paid guys.  Oh, boy.  But someone has to make sure it's set and ready to go because now we can't do that.  The wrath of Opie will be upon you.  Whatever.  And it will be justified.  Whatever.  I'm in whatever mode.  I swear to God.  When Opie gets mad, he starts pointing and that shirt starts flaring and he starts  seeing that little delicious V at the bottom of his ab, he's not happy.  Oh.  Oh.  Everything's all better now, though, Opie. 
[02:05:00]  It sure is.  Muffins are here.  Our muffins are here.  Low-fat muffins coming up.  You know, just in time.  I don't even remember what I was pissed off about.  Who knows?  I'll tell you.  You're pissed off that nobody checked that file and now the show is spoiled.  Oh, thank you, Jimmy.  All right.  Oh, what do we got?  Oh.  I got some kind of abortion in a bag.  Oh.  By the way, when is our Starbucks machine going to get here that we asked for three months  ago?  Right after the commercial on the Opie and Anthony van. 
[02:05:30]  Do you know how much money we're spending on Starbucks every day?  Hey, Mike.  The least we can do is get some free coffee from Starbucks.  This is interesting.  Mike, did you buy yourself something with the money?  It's just a mushy.  Good.  It's not your privilege to do so.  What'd you get, Judy?  This is like getting soup in a bag.  What the hell is that?  Is there a fork or something readily available?  Of course it is.  How about a fork for me, too, if you don't mind?  Why are they throwing just a piece of cake in paper bag?  I know.  Why do they just throw this in a bag?  Because, you know, the cake has that nice top to it.  Well, that's all stuck to the paper bag now.  It's very moist and cakey, and now it's fallen apart. 
[02:06:00]  I'm using the bag like a cone.  You can't eat it.  I'm going to have to eat it like this.  You want my straw for your cake?  This is moist cakey.  All right, well, we're waiting for the Hulk Hogan audio.  We'll do that.  Thank you, sir.  Why don't we do the workplace slackers?  We got those clips and those fingers a little close to the tines, my friend.  Yeah, we don't like that.  You hold it on the back of the fork. 
[02:06:30]  I'm going to hold that kid down and just put it right in his mouth.  Here's Ant talking to one of the interns about his milk and how it should be presented.  Oh.  Come in with the milk.  Come in with the milk.  Come in with the milk.  Come in with the milk.  Come in with the milk.  Come in with the milk.  He has to open the bag with his right hand and hold the bag out to me at a 45 degree angle.  45.  So I move into the bag without touching the paper. 
[02:07:00]  I'm amazed you're eating that cake.  Mmm.  Cakey goodness.  Knowing about your phobias.  If there is any variation of these instructions, any, even to the smallest degree, the entire  process must be repeated from the beginning.  Come in with the milk.  Repeat it.  Come in with the milk.  From the beginning.  From the beginning.  Come in with the milk.  Come in with the milk.  From the beginning.  Come in with the milk.  Come in with the milk.  Come in with the milk. 
[02:07:30]  Come in with the milk.  From the beginning.  From the beginning.  From the beginning.  Not the middle.  Not where it's screwed up from.  From the beginning.  I understand.  Completely.  Well, everyone should.  How's your case?  All right, Steve came to the rescue, and we now have the Hulk Hogan audio.  Scrum diddly-ish, yes, Jimmy.  Hulk's sure in heaven is my new walk-on music for gigs.  All right, here we go, Anthony.  So Hulk Hogan has one of these celebrity reality shows. 
[02:08:00]  I think it's on VH1 or I don't know.  VH1.  Basically, it's Hulk Hogan and his family.  He's got a really hot daughter that's trying to make it in the music business.  In the music business?  She's only 16, and I took a really good look at her during this show.  She's not as hot as everyone's saying.  That's what I'm hearing.  She's a big girl already.  She's got a beautiful face, yes.  But Hulk Hogan's a monster, and his wife's pretty big, too.  And his daughter is, you know. 
[02:08:30]  I'm going to pop her up here.  She's starting to get big already.  I mean, she's beautiful in the face, absolutely beautiful.  Wow, she didn't look that thin on the show last night.  Not at all.  But then again, got to put that in perspective.  She's next to Hulk Hogan, so maybe Hulk is making her look thinner.  That's right, brother.  He's a big guy.  So I took a peek because it seemed like it would be a good show to watch, Anthony.  Man, they are acting like you wouldn't believe.  Setting up scenes.  Really?  She's on the phone.  It's all fake.  She's on the phone because I guess this guy who's 22 wants to ask her out on a date. 
[02:09:00]  Ooh, a little too old.  And then she has to talk to her father, Hulk, about it.  And then, you know, they sort of agree.  All right, you can go out on a date, but no kissing, nothing.  Just, you know, whatever.  And so she calls the boyfriend to give him the good news.  And it's obviously so fake, and they both have a script.  Really?  And they're just like, ugh.  I don't want to hear that.  All right, well, we've got some clips of the Hulk Hogan show here.  Hulk's big.  Brooke Hogan asked Hulk if she can go out on date with 22-year-old Guy. 
[02:09:30]  Now remember, she's 16.  Hey, Dad?  Yeah, baby.  Dad, do you remember Adam's?  I'm glad you brought it to the charging.  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Why don't you try the other CD player?  Let's just make sure it's not the CD player.  No, it's not the CD player.  It was coming through one channel.  I heard it coming through one channel.  Sometimes it's hard to believe that this is a huge talk show.  A huge national talk show run by monkeys. 
[02:10:00]  And now I'm done with my cake, so I don't even have that to make me feel good.  I'm still enjoying my muffin if anybody cares.  Opie, how's your muffin?  Opie, why don't you open up that muffin and take a bite?  Take a big bite of your muffin.  You'll feel better.  I'll go over there and cut that muffin into some pieces for you.  I promise.  A couple of men just enjoying a beverage.  God.  What happened?  We have...  Hawk?  We have like ten guys working for us now. 
[02:10:30]  Steve's working on it again.  He doesn't know why he came in through one channel, but he's working on it again.  We'll have a new distance in a second.  But wouldn't we just check it real fast and make sure it's okay before we bring it into  the master control room?  Master control room.  Why's it got to be the master control room?  All right.  Well, Derek, get us out of here.  Like sand through the hourglass, so is the O&A virus.  Wow.  You rule, Bernie.  It's burnout.  No, please do.  This one, right?  Yeah, this arm.  Oh, you motherfucker. 
[02:11:00]  Tony.  Tony.  Oh, he's coming over here.  Oh, Bernie.  Bernie, sit down.  Sit down.  Oh, my God.  He's really mad.  He's mad.  You pissed off Bernie.  All right.  Get over there.  Get over there.  It's getting hot in here.  It's getting hot in here.  It's getting real hot in here.  Bernie, I don't have to take that.  You don't have to take that, Bernie.  All right.  Sit down.  Stand up to your right, Bernie. 
[02:11:30]  Sit down, Bernie.  Sit down.  It's okay.  It's okay.  It's okay.  Oh, it's okay.  It's okay.  Oh, it's okay.  Oh, it's okay.  Oh, it's okay.  All right.  Have Bernie sit down.  Bernie, take a seat.  Let's all calm down.  It's all right.  Oh, oh, oh.  Where did you get that fucking seat?  Oh, yeah.  Hand over that fucking seat.  Oh, you're going to have another.  You lunatic.  All right, Bernie.  Oh, he's fine, Paul. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, he's fine.  You tell him to relax.  Yeah, tell him.  Yeah, everyone just relax.  Everybody relax.  All he did was take the CD out.  Yeah.  Fuck you.  Keep your CD out.  I'm going to be here again.  Bernie.  Bernie.  Bernie.  Bernie.  Bernie.  Bernie.  Bernie's leaving.  Oh, man.  All right.  He's walking out.  Wow, man.  Holy shit.  Wow.  That was legendary.  That was the rage.  That was what happened on that train.  Oh, my God.  I'm not even kidding.  That was what happened on that train.  We saw it.  He was out of his mind. 
[02:12:30]  Hey, you know what's odd?  We were talking about Rain Man.  And when you were watching Rain Man, remember, it was kind of like you look at Dustin Hoffman  and go, not too bad.  He's a little kooky and stuff.  But he seems nice and sweet.  And then that time he lost it at the airport.  Oh, yeah.  Just like, ah!  Just lost his mind.  That's what we saw.  That snap.  That was right now.  You just threw his CD.  It was like a Pop-Tart in the toaster.  And a little smoke building up.  And he couldn't handle it.  Right.  Imagine that, though.  You didn't see it coming.  No.  It came out of nowhere. 
[02:13:00]  He just won't.  Fuck you.  Keep your CD.  Keep your CD.  Fuck you.  And take this with you.  You have another.  Take your CD.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  Anthony and Anthony, the virus is spreading. 
[02:13:30]  Remember that.  Love it.  Is what I got.  All right.  We're trying to get the show back on track here.  Waiting for the Hulk Hogan audio.  Something else that we might bring to the program today, hopefully.  What's going on with the BBC, Anthony?  First of all.  The BBC, they've re-edited some of the coverage of the London Underground and bus bombing to 
[02:14:00]  avoid labeling the perpetrators as terrorists.  Early reporting of the attacks on the BBC's website spoke of terrorists, but the same coverage  was changed to describe the attackers as simply bombers.  The BBC guidelines state that its credibility is undermined by the, quote, careless use of words which  carry emotional or value judgments. 
[02:14:30]  Consequently, the word terrorist itself can be a barrier rather than an aid to understanding,  and its use should be avoided.  Are you kidding?  They're mopping people off the walls of their subways, yet terrorists, using the word terrorist,  now you're classifying these people, and it's bad, and we shouldn't do that.  People that always trash me because I always bash one segment of the population. 
[02:15:00]  Wait, can I do the impression?  Sure.  That's why I hate the left.  That's pretty good.  That's a good Jimmy.  It actually was.  Can one person maybe explain that?  That's the mentality.  I don't hate them for gay rights.  I don't hate them for abortion.  It's none of the most stem cell research I agree with.  Absolutely.  It's that.  Right in a nutshell.  Right there.  That is why I hate them. 
[02:15:30]  If someone can justify it, I'd be willing to listen.  Can one person please, I know I'm unfair, I bash liberals, can one person please call in,  and I'd be happy to listen.  They're more worried about hurting the feelings of the terrorists.  They're terrorists.  No, don't offend Muslims.  Can just one person explain it?  I'll make no value judgments.  Yeah.  I just want to know.  Don't make a value judgment.  They're not terrorists.  They're bombers.  What? 
[02:16:00]  Don't they understand?  We're never, ever solving this terrorism problem.  The whole war on terror and we're fighting and this.  It's never going to stop unless we get past shit like this and really fight the real war  and the real battle and not with these rules and this not offending and political correctness.  It's not going to work.  They will keep bombing us and doing things until we really start fighting seriously here. 
[02:16:30]  It's the limitations put on our military, on the press, on the way we're allowed to profile these people.  We're screwed.  We will continue to be blown up until we realize that there's only one way we're going to actually win this  and not by, you know, not hurting feelings.  Yeah.  And again, maybe somebody has a rational explanation as to why that mentality makes sense 
[02:17:00]  as far as you can't say terrorists with bombings.  Maybe someone has a rational explanation.  I won't make any judgments.  Maybe the phones are ringing a lot right now.  Maybe somebody can help.  I would love a rational.  Somebody from that point of view has an honest and intelligent way of explaining it.  That's the BBC.  We have the Hulk Hogan audio back in the studio.  No, we don't.  Oh, but just throw the disc.  It's not going to work.  It's not right. 
[02:17:30]  I'm just waiting.  Danny's taking phone calls right now.  Ooh.  Is he?  Hopefully he won us from a barber.  Let's say hi to Adam and...  And why do you say that there, Jimmy?  I don't know.  Fucking Heat-Mizer.  Fucking running around with that awful thing on the top of his head.  What is that?  He just threw a hat on.  He looks like Gene Simmons from the Destroyer album cover.  Dan from New York.  Ant and Jimmy, you missed the whole point of what they're saying. 
[02:18:00]  This is the opposite of what Fox News does.  They are saying they should report the news instead of trying to mold opinions with buzzwords, which our media is so great at.  No.  Not calling them...  They are terrorists.  They are.  This isn't calling, you know, some kid with a pipe bomb in his basement that his friends built, you know, to go out to the school field and blow it up because they have bombs.  Terrorists in your neighborhood?  That's bullshit.  That's using the word terrorist improperly on a news report to sensationalize the whole thing. 
[02:18:30]  What they did is terrorism.  They do it to terrorize people.  It's terrorists.  They're not taking that out because it's a buzzword is not accurately broadcasting what these people are.  Right.  Bombers can just be...  That's very vague.  That's a vague thing.  A bomber.  A terrorist.  A bomber could just place one bomb.  Hey, I don't like this electrical tower in my backyard. 
[02:19:00]  I'm going to plant a bomb here and take it down.  That's the purpose of my bombing.  I don't bomb other things.  I'm not trying to scare anyone.  I want to get rid of that.  That guy's a bomber.  A terrorist are people that use these tactics to scare a lot of people into, you know, giving up prisoners, moving troops, believing their ideology, whatever it may be.  They're terrorizing people.  So to not use the word terrorist is inaccurate reporting. 
[02:19:30]  They're Dan.  Yeah.  So it's not for buzzword purposes.  Hey, Steve.  I know you're trying to help the program.  Hi, Steve.  And you just handed us all...  Sorry.  That came from...  A piece of paper?  I guess Ben asked one of the interns to print that out.  So I was just bringing it in when I brought in Jimmy's water.  What is this?  It was about the...  It's about the...  Whatever.  Separatist party.  God damn it.  What is this?  All right.  You're just talking about?  I don't know specifically.  All right.  You handed this to everyone, right?  Try to read this.  Okay.  Just try to read this. 
[02:20:00]  And I'm not even abusing you because you guys are trying to help the show.  When stories break, there's another bombing that just happened, Anthony.  Apparently, details just coming in.  Madrid, Spain, four small bombs exploded Tuesday near a power plant in the Basque region after a warning call from the separatist group ETA.  Okay.  You can stop there.  Uh-huh.  So then, you know, we decided to do some research on this group, right?  So Steve runs in with, I guess, a definition of what this group is.  ETA.  They're called the Estimated Times of Arrival. 
[02:20:30]  Ah.  Try to read that.  Is an armed Basque...  Is an armed Basque...  What's the name?  No, no.  Start from the beginning because that's what you guys expected us to do.  Oh, ETA or initials for what?  Oh, it's...  Woof.  Go ahead.  Yuskadi ta askatusana.  No, that's way off.  Try again.  Yuskadi ta askatusuna.  Okay.  Askatusuna.  Wait.  Askatusuna.  Just trying to show you guys how tough our job is. 
[02:21:00]  Askatusuna.  Yeah.  These guys, like, do their research, which I love, and then they just throw it at us and assume that we'll have no problem with this.  So go ahead, Steve.  Start from the beginning again.  Yuskadi ta askatusuna.  All right.  Continue.  Is an armed Basque separatist organization that seeks, through means including violence, to create an independent socialist state for the Basque people separate from Spain and France, the states that currently control the Basque country.  Uh-huh.  Continue.  ETA is considered by Spain, France, the European Union, and the United States to be a terrorist organization. 
[02:21:30]  The name Yuskadi ta askatusuna is in the Basque language and translates as Basque country and liberty.  ETA's motto is Baitan Yari.  I don't know.  I'm guessing on that one.  Keep up in parentheses.  Keep up on both.  This refers to the two figures in the ETA symbol, the snake, symbolizing secrecy and astuteness, wrapped up, wrapped around an axe, representing strength.  Oh. 
[02:22:00]  Well, if this isn't comedy fodder, I don't know what it is.  Oh, this is hysterical.  What I'm just saying is like...  I'd want to know, though.  They threw this definition out.  It's like, we'll be able to decipher this definition?  Right.  I have no idea what you said.  All this information, and I have no idea when they were founded.  Wait, wait, no.  There's actually a really, really funny line.  This is going to be great to riff on on a comedy show.  Last line.  The organization was founded in 1959 and evolved rapidly from a group advocating traditional cultural ways to an armed resistance movement.  Ah. 
[02:22:30]  That is everything I wanted to know about ETA.  That's right.  Oh, wait.  By that I mean nothing I've ever wanted to know.  They threw it at us like, here, guys.  Here's the definition.  Run with it.  Here it is, guys.  Comedy gold.  Hot off the presses.  Distracting us as they give each of us our individual copy.  Holy crap.  My brain just exploded. 
[02:23:00]  Well.  But thank you, Steve.  You're welcome.  All right.  I wouldn't assume that it would be funny anyway.  No, it wasn't even about being funny.  It's the stark definition of a terrorist organization.  No, we're not always funny on this show.  God knows that.  Gotcha.  And we're talking about a serious subject, and we're going a little deeper into the subject, because Elo taught us this.  He certainly did.  Three levels.  And now we've got the definition of this group, and it just blew up everyone's brains.  Who's our local terrorism expert?  That's what we need, right?  Eric said that that's the third thing, is you get the local expert. 
[02:23:30]  Experts.  See, you're Lebanese terrorists.  They seem like nice terrorists.  They warn you beforehand so there's no injuries.  They evacuated the power plant before the bombs went off.  They just kind of blow up property.  They have had some fatal bombings, but...  But for the most part, they warn you before?  No, ETA is blamed for more than 800 deaths since the late 60s.  Wow.  But they've staged nearly a dozen non-lethal attacks since the Spanish government announced in May it would hold talks with the group if it renounced violence. 
[02:24:00]  So now they just blow up things.  Isn't that nice?  They're pleasant terrorists.  All right, why don't we go to the phones?  Tommy, what's up?  Hey, good morning, John Belushi, boy.  I think you guys should be careful what you wish for, because not so long ago you guys were talking about the news media and their scare tactics, you know, that whole bit.  And it seems like they're doing exactly what you guys want. 
[02:24:30]  I don't agree with them at all, but it just seems like that's what they're doing.  There's one way you can go and the other way, you know, the swinging pendulum.  And the middle seems to be the answer, but this is going way the other way.  They're not renouncing scare tactics.  They're kowtowing to political correctness and trying to not offend certain religious groups.  They're not trying to not scare people.  I think we have to go back to Anthony, and he described it beautifully.  About the whole terrorist thing.  What is a terrorist and what's not a terrorist? 
[02:25:00]  And to loosely use that word, I think that's what we're talking about here.  Bomber.  That's right.  Plus, what are the odds some say a popular drug to treat a common disease could turn you into a compulsive gambler?  What?  Are you kidding?  Was that a real one?  A popular drug.  Like Anthony said, too, about the pendulum, okay?  That's what we're getting at.  Yeah.  That's what we're getting at, the scare tactics and taking it to the Uber limit can turn you into a compulsive gambler? 
[02:25:30]  How does that happen?  It's a little white square drug, and it has one black dot on one, six on the other, nine on one.  Yeah.  Plus, what are the odds some say a popular drug to treat a common disease could turn you into a compulsive gambler?  Popular drug, common disease.  He said what are the odds, too.  What are the odds?  Of course.  Get it?  Wink, wink.  It could turn you into a gambler.  Play your cards right and watch the broadcast tonight. 
[02:26:00]  Oh, maybe, um, maybe Metamucil, because when you take it, you get the craps.  Damn it.  That's good.  I was going to try for a Viagra joke, but there you go.  Very good.  Wait, um, you're funny.  How about, um, oh, it was really good.  Wait, there's got to be more pills.  I know.  We could go off now.  How about aspirin, because then you bet you're going to get a headache.  Oh, flitty.  Oh, flitty.  That's what we're talking about.  That's scare tactics. 
[02:26:30]  Taken to the limit.  I can't take any drugs.  Uh, I'll gamble my nest egg away.  All right.  Terror is bad.  Terror is bad.  ELO expert.  ELO terrorist expert.  And I just want to say that terrorists are bad.  You know what?  I just fucked up your whole bed.  Yeah.  And I'm sorry.  Yes, my name is Eric Logan.  I'm a terrorist expert.  I just want to say that terrorists are bad.  Thank you.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on, dude.  We're not hearing you.  No, it's not his fault, though. 
[02:27:00]  I know, but I'm not hearing him.  Dude, what'd you say?  I heard Logan.  My name is Eric Logan.  I'm a terrorist expert.  I just want to say that terrorists are bad.  Thank you.  What about terrorists, dude?  See what happened?  Well, what happened, uh, we have a phone screening thing here, and I went right to subject  where it said terror is bad, so I'm thinking, you know, that was just a brief  explanation of what this guy wanted to talk about.  Right.  But I should have went to the name where it says ELO, and I messed up his whole bit  by going terror is bad.  Maybe he'll call back. 
[02:27:30]  Uh, makes it, all right.  Are we done with this?  Does anyone have, offering an explanation as to that line of thinking?  Let's go to Drew in Vermont.  Drew?  Hey, I just wanted to say, I don't agree with, uh, I don't agree with the BBC, cannot call  it terrorism, but at least they're being consistent, because they wouldn't call 9-11  terrorists either.  And of course, you see when, uh, when it hits them, boom, terrorism, but now at least they're  being consistent and taking it back.  Well, why would, I don't understand, like, why wouldn't they call 9-11 terrorism? 
[02:28:00]  Like, I, what, what is it that they're trying to accomplish by being dishonest by, by omission?  I hope you're not asking me, because I don't know.  I know, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm talking like you're the editor-in-chief.  Call this show, you're being questioned, sir.  I'm just a listener, Jesus.  Hey, I just want to enjoy, uh, the show, guys.  That's true, I'm jumping down his throat.  Don't put too much pressure on me.  Oh, thank you.  I just want to sit back and hear a dick joke.  Jesus, leave me alone.  Why wouldn't they call it terrorism?  What do you accomplish by that?  That's a great question, by the way, by dishonesty of omission. 
[02:28:30]  I'm very proud of myself for that.  And, unfortunately, I asked an ice cream-eating boob from Vermont who had no idea.  He likes his Ben and Jerry's, right?  I bet he does.  Okay, let's, uh, go to the Hogan audio, Anthony.  Now we have to.  Uh-huh.  Hulk Hogan, he, uh, has a reality show.  He's got a hot daughter.  She wants to be in the music business.  I personally think she's already a little chunky for 16 years old.  Really?  Also has a son.  That's healthy to say things like that, Opie.  Why?  16-year-old girl, you think she's a little chunky?  That won't start on a nice road to, uh, an eating disorder. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, because she listens to our show every day.  You never know.  I bet you Hulk does listen to the show.  That's right, brother.  That's right.  Don't get him mad.  You know what happens when he gets mad.  So here we go.  Brooke Hogan asked Hulk, her father, if she can go on date with a 22-year-old guy.  Hey, Dad.  Yo, baby.  Dad, do you remember Adam?  Well, that jabroni that charged me too much for parts.  Yeah, I know.  Listen to the acting, by the way.  This is what pisses me off about the show.  I thought the concept for the show would be great.  Hulk Hogan living his family life.  But the acting is so awful. 
[02:29:30]  It's obvious that they have some things that are going on, and then somebody's sitting down  and going, all right, we're going to set this scene up.  You're going to go to your father and talk about dating this older guy.  Instead of just letting it happen naturally.  But I think these reality shows are getting lazy, because like with the real world, they  sit around for four months waiting for shit to happen.  But now with this reality show craze and you get celebrities involved, they can't be bothered  for four or five months, so now they're writing their storylines for these people.  You have to tape a lot of stuff to get just a half hour episode. 
[02:30:00]  To get gold.  Of a show.  But these guys, yeah, they don't have all day.  Now these idiots in Hollywood, they're now going to wreck the reality show craze by now  writing the stuff for these people.  I mean, it's something that is probably going down.  But now they're like, all right, let's get right to it instead of waiting for that  moment when she decides she's going to talk to Hulk about dating an older guy.  Get it?  Because most of them are not interesting enough to pull off a reality show.  Well, and you need to, you know, invest the time.  How's Britney Spears?  Huh?  Is her still on?  Oh, that show died. 
[02:30:30]  Is it yanked already?  Oh, it was just gone.  Good.  They wanted to yank it after the first episode.  No, it's done.  That was funny.  Yo, baby.  Dad, do you remember Adam?  Well, that jabroni that charged me too much for parts.  Yeah, I don't know.  I think he's kind of cute.  Point being.  Um, he wanted to know if we could, like, go to Busch Gardens or something.  And Nick?  No, just me and Adam.  You and Adam.  How old's Adam?  Just turned 22.  22?  And she just turned 16? 
[02:31:00]  Not like he's 35.  Not as long as my name's Hulk Hogan.  No, she's not going out with him.  He's 22 years old.  Think about it.  No, but you know he's a smart, sharp guy.  Don't look at it like you're some strange person.  How do I know where my Bob Carr parts from him?  What do you want her to do?  Just dampen her room like Rapunzel for the next 100 years?  Well, we can send her out to the chicken ranch in Vegas, too.  Well, don't take it to an extreme either.  Let me tell you something right now.  Let me tell you something.  He's already been in college four years.  Think he hasn't had sex with girls.  Probably.  Probably?  I really seriously doubt that that's what they're going to do the first time they hook up. 
[02:31:30]  It's been a long day.  I'm going to think about it.  I'm going to sleep on it because I'm done with it for now.  How fake is this?  Why does there have to be fucking music playing through the whole fucking conversation?  Dramatize a little bit, Jimmy.  Holy shit.  Can we stop?  Is that real?  Where's the heavy metal bed under us?  Where's our music?  We used to have to talk with music under us, Anthony. 
[02:32:00]  Let's not forget AAF.  AAF, we had to have music beds underneath us the whole time.  How stimulated do we have to be that we can't have a conversation between a steroid-popping man and a monolith of a child?  But the acting is horrendous.  Yeah, babe.  Let's go to Eric in Boston.  Eric?  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey, I know about the drug that makes you into a gambler.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, it's an experimental cure for Parkinson's. 
[02:32:30]  It's not out yet.  It's not FDA approval, but it does.  It makes you into a compulsive gambler.  Someone lost like $200,000 while she was on it.  What happened was, now, here's the problem.  I remember that case.  It wasn't that she lost money.  It was that it wasn't working for her Parkinson's.  So she was at the table, and they kept saying, do you want me to hit?  And her head kept moving so they wouldn't hit her.  And she kept staying at four.  I kept staying at four.  But wouldn't you split the twos in that?  No, no, no.  She had a three and a one, an ace.  But she shows not to make him an 11. 
[02:33:00]  But then that would be a 14-pounder.  No, no, no.  She took it as a one.  I talked to her.  All right.  Her head was moving.  Split twos.  No.  Oof.  That would be an ugly move, right, Ant?  Ugly move.  All right.  Thank you, Eric.  So it's not a popular drug, and it's not a popular disease.  All right.  Here's another clip from Hogan Knows Best, Anthony.  Now, Hulk talks to this guy.  He's 22 years old.  And before he could take Hulk's daughter out.  This conversation.  This should be good.  This is awful. 
[02:33:30]  I hate to be unsociable.  I need to talk to Adam for a few minutes about the event you guys have scheduled.  You sure those guns didn't get bigger less than last year?  They're about the same size.  First off, back me up, because, you know, I'm just one of those wrestlers, you know,  and I've only got a certain capability of understanding the whole outline here of how this works. 
[02:34:00]  I know Brooke is 16 years old, and I know you're 22.  And when I was 22 years old, the last thing I had on my mind was a 16-year-old girl.  Just explain to me how this all works, so I'll understand it better.  Sure.  Well, I mean, you know, Nick and I talked online.  She's so hot.  And I said the wrong thing.  You know, a while back, Brooke got a hold of me online as well.  Brooke got a hold of you?  Yeah, actually.  We got chatting.  Hit it off good.  And we've just been friends ever since. 
[02:34:30]  You know, it's borderline.  An adult, you know, taking out a minor.  It might fall into that unchartered territory of not legal.  I'm not sure what the laws are.  Luckily, none of those laws apply to going out.  Those are only applicable for, you know, sex.  Brooke's not sexually active.  I didn't lose my virginity until I was 19 years old.  Yeah.  So basically, you are sexually active.  I mean, I don't see how any of this pertains to Brooke either.  Well, I didn't say it pertained to Brooke. 
[02:35:00]  I was just talking to you.  Oh.  You were curious about my sex life?  Yeah, kind of.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Have you had, like, an AIDS test?  Have I had an AIDS test?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Negative.  Why does the music keep stopping?  We're going to take the blue beast out there.  It's drama, Timmy.  I'll explain in a second, Jimmy.  Well, I don't think that's going to happen.  Oh?  I think it would be a lot better if we go ahead and take Brooke's car. 
[02:35:30]  I don't know whether she drives or you drive.  All right.  Either way.  Just as long as we're on the same page.  Yeah, I think we're hanging out in the same arena.  So this is another fake reality show, first of all.  The acting is so bad.  And they went back to Hollywood with what they had.  And they realized they had shit.  So they're like, oh, fuck.  So then what they did was, all right, let's distract the viewers with music and stuff.  And we can dramatize with the music like you were saying.  God, it fucking stinks.  Because the material doesn't hold up on its own. 
[02:36:00]  So now you go back into the studio and you jazz it up.  And that's what they're doing with the music and the dramatic stops of the music and all that.  Just to make this shit bearable.  How'd you get here?  Bow.  I drove.  Bow.  Bow.  I guarantee they know they have a disaster on their hands.  I guarantee it.  Yeah, that's pretty bad.  Where's Hulkster in heaven?  Huh?  Can we hear Hulkster in heaven?  I've been begging all day.  That's what they should play.  I'm always talking. 
[02:36:30]  You want to go out with my daughter?  Hulkster in heaven.  I read it in the papers.  Oh.  I saw it on TV.  There you go.  I guess it'll be one empty seat.  When I wrestle it when we leave.  Oh.  I used to tear my shirt.  But now you tore my heart.  I knew you were a Hulkster maniac. 
[02:37:00]  Right from the very start.  Right from the start.  You were my friend.  All I hear is not giving you.  Oh.  When the Hulkster comes to heaven.  Heaven, heaven, heaven, heaven.  When the Hulkster comes to heaven.  Again.  Again.  The world just starts. 
[02:37:30]  Oh, my, my, my, my.  I'll see you again.  I'll see you again.  I wish you were so close.  I can't take that.  Oh, crap.  But you know what it is?  There's going to be an extra seat when he wrestles at Wimbley.  Wimbley.  Oh.  And maybe that bad little boy didn't go to heaven.  That's right.  Maybe he was a bad boy.  Maybe he was a naughty boy. 
[02:38:00]  Maybe, perhaps a bit more.  No, no, no, no.  He, he, he.  My son didn't like Wimbley at first.  Get it out of your system, please.  He's quite a willful young dead boy.  Wrestler?  Oh, Jimmy.  That one stinks.  God damn it.  You just wrecked the bed.  You know, the sound is all funny and stuff, but the smell.  I know, it's hot. 
[02:38:30]  I'm eating raisin bran tomorrow morning.  Go ahead.  There's something about the smell I recognize.  Hey, that's dog food.  All right, we have another clip from Hogan Knows Best, Anthony.  Now, Hulk prepares his lovely daughter, Brooke, for the date.  Let's go to the clip.  Prepares her.  Prepares her, yes.  Watch that snatch.  Listen to this crap.  Yeah.  Brooke, Taney.  A quick little talk.  Adam, I got a weird thing on the body.  No drinking, of course. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah.  You know, no physical stuff.  Dad.  Listen, I'm just telling you.  I won't.  I know you won't, but I don't want him on you.  You know, I need this worrying with a hole in the head, you know that?  Don't worry.  You know, I throw a really mean cross.  Let me see it one time.  Ah!  You can give me a call about every hour or so.  You want a weapon or anything?  Hello?  Adam's here, so. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah, good job.  You got it.  Good job.  Thank you.  You know what's going on here?  Hulk is pimping out his hot daughter.  Yeah.  To get a little more fame on TV.  Right.  That's all he's doing.  He's pimping out his hot daughter.  How great would it be if he said, all right, look, Jorana's going to pick you up.  We know the Vandersloots.  They're a good family.  He's just going to take you for a ride on the beach.  You're going to Aruba.  Oh.  You ever had the conversation there?  I had pretty much the similar situation where I was, I guess, 21 and the girl was 16 and 
[02:40:00]  the father used to drop her off at the house on the weekends.  Oh, I love this story.  Yeah, he used to drop her off at the house on the weekends.  When my mother was away, she would go to work.  And my mother wasn't coming home until like 3 in the morning.  She worked at a disco.  And, yeah, the father would drop the girl off at my house.  And when we first started going out, he had a nice little discussion with me in his work van.  I don't even remember what he did, but it was a work van.  A lot of tools in there knocking around. 
[02:40:30]  And he had a whole conversation with me that, you know, his daughter is 16 and he thinks I'm too old to be with her.  But he's not going to tell her that because, you know, that'll make it worse.  Like, he really was just knocking me.  And I was just a bum.  I'm just there.  Eh, shut up.  Whatever.  Sitting there.  Yes, sir.  Okay.  You know, meanwhile, all I'm thinking is keep dropping her off at the house.  Because he would drop her off.  And that was it.  It was just sex. 
[02:41:00]  Sex, sex, sex.  Until 11 o'clock when he came to pick her back up again.  What did he think he was dropping his daughter off for?  Well, you'd say beforehand, like, oh, there's movies, we're watching, you know, a movie, or we're going out, or, you know, there's friends.  Because she had friends.  But basically he was just dropping her off to get laid.  And he had no idea.  Yeah, he was like the pimp.  He would just drop her off to get laid.  And have to make sure she's all cleaned up and ready to go by 11. 
[02:41:30]  Nothing, you know.  Spray a little perfume on you there, honey.  Get in the van with Daddy.  Wipe her down with baby wipes.  It's like bleach.  Pat in New York.  That's an awful conversation when you're that age.  To have, like, the father talking to you.  You just don't want to deal with the father.  Tell me about it.  Don't want to.  Pat in New York.  Hey, how's it going?  What's up, Pat?  Well, I got an explanation, I guess, on why they might be using bombers instead of terrorists. 
[02:42:00]  Okay.  Um, like, I mean, I took a bunch of communications classes, journalism in college.  And one of the things they hammer into you is if you can't prove, like, a direct intent, you can't call it one thing or the other.  So it could, like, while there is still the possibility that it could just be some crackpot that wants to impress Jodie Foster's, and, you know.  Okay, that's understandable, but, like, when the guy said, why wouldn't they call 9-11 terrorism?  I mean, like, there becomes a point where if you don't know it, you're blind. 
[02:42:30]  And I understand that you have to prove it first.  That's fine.  But Al-Qaeda apparently claimed responsibility.  Yeah, and it's the same M.O.  Yeah, I mean, come on.  Yeah, I mean, I don't know, I mean, like you said, it's probably a little, or, well, like I didn't say, but it's probably, I mean, it's very obvious to attack.  But while there's still that, like, hint of a possibility and they can't make that connection, they kind of have to do that.  In this case, I mean, I think that's probably going a little too far.  I don't think it's, like, a left and right thing.  Oh, I certainly do, because political correctness, the right has many diseases. 
[02:43:00]  They're awful.  But political correctness is not a disease of the right.  And they are revolting in many other ways, but just that's not one of them.  Yeah, well, I mean, you're probably right, but, you know, that's one possibility, I guess you could say.  Okay.  All right, thank you, bro.  Bye, Mr.  We got one more track or clip here from Hogan Knows Best, Anthony.  I hope there's music under it.  So now Brooke is out on the date. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah.  A little spin on the whole thing.  Now Hulk Hogan's son decides to tell his father something about...  He's gay?  About the kid.  Oh.  That maybe he should have told the father beforehand.  But it wouldn't have made the drama.  Yeah, it wouldn't have made the drama and made for good TV.  You know Adam's got nipple rings, right?  Both of his nipples are pierced.  What's wrong?  Tell the master of the universe...  You hear that?  What's wrong? 
[02:44:00]  Bad acting.  That was good.  Come running in.  What's wrong?  Rachel.  I was in the moment.  What's wrong?  Come back.  Linda.  The show is a disaster.  You know Adam's got nipple rings, right?  Both of his nipples are pierced.  Linda!  What's wrong?  Tell the master of the universe what you just told me.  Adam's got pierced nipples.  What?  What about his scrotum?  Does he have that pierced, too? 
[02:44:30]  In Miami, when I went down there to hang out with him for a little bit.  You're kidding me!  Going out to the beach, and, like, there was, like, this topless beach.  He knew some of the topless chicks down there, and, like, I saw pictures of some of the parties he had, like, hung up on his refrigerator and stuff.  Like, she's got, like, alcohol and stuff all in his house, whatever.  He's got the pool table, all kinds of stuff.  Nicky, if you know that stuff, you need to, like, at least mark at that a little bit.  He's a cool kid.  He didn't cross my mind until now.  That's just great.  And I'm, like, I'm hot. 
[02:45:00]  All of a sudden, I'm, like, I'm on fire.  I had...  You're going to have a major timeout for about a year.  Nick, I'm going to tell you something.  That's a big deal.  I thought I told you when I was down in Miami.  He's got pierced nipples.  Didn't he say he took you down there, he showed you the gay beach?  Yeah, because I was...  I don't think that was appropriate for him to take you to a gay beach.  You went to a gay beach with Adam Meyers?  Well, that's even worse, then.  That's even worse.  He's taking our 16-year-old daughter out, but he's already taking our 14-year-old boy out. 
[02:45:30]  He's taking our 16-year-old daughter out.  Good luck with the show.  Good luck, Hulkster.  I was pretty caught up in that.  You're going to need it.  Yeah.  She's yours, Adam.  Be good to her.  That's the big conflict.  There's nipple rings.  Nipple rings.  Uh-oh.  Oh, my goodness.  We have Brooke's song that they're trying to shove down our throat. 
[02:46:00]  Oh, well, this is the whole thing, isn't it?  This is what it comes down to.  A little cross-promotion.  I got something to tell you about Jim.  What?  He doubles as a toilet.  Linda!  Because now that's what MTV does.  Yeah.  Instead of, like, letting the artist come to them, now they're just creating the artist themselves.  They just take some dope, give them a reality show.  Oh, and by the way, this reality show star has a single, and it's a whole thing they're doing now.  Yeah, her record coming out now. 
[02:46:30]  Like, Ashley Simpson, she's stank.  She's ruined.  Awful.  She's not ruined.  No.  She's still going strong.  Is she stopped?  Because she's got the support of MTV behind her.  But that's the latest craze.  They're making their own pop stars now.  And so, letting the pop stars come to them somehow.  What does she sound like, this one?  Let's take a listen.  Everything to me, Brooke Hogan.  Good so far.  On the Opie and Anthony Disaster.  I like her.  I like her.  I like her.  I like her.  I like her.  I like her.  I like her.  I like her.  You want to go. 
[02:47:00]  And as you open up the door, you change your mind.  Every song that's out right now.  All these things I feel inside, I want to show you.  There's nothing I've got to find.  Oh, baby, I don't.  I want to make you see.  There's nothing more to fear.  Because everything's right here.  I'm everything you want. 
[02:47:30]  Ooh.  She's everything you want.  Yeah.  I can reach things on the top shelf.  Paint the ceiling without a ladder.  That's great.  Everyone else in the video has stilts.  Irritating.  And we're supposed to pretend that she's singing about something else.  Instead of her hot, young body.  Her hotness.  Jesus.  You need every little part of you is a part of me. 
[02:48:00]  Let me think you know.  This reminds me.  I'm trying to think of.  There's like 3,000 songs this reminds me of.  Yeah.  All of which I'll list right now for you.  It is.  It's every song.  Every chick song right now.  It's all about being blonde.  I'm everything you need.  Are you?  Really?  Really?  Sperm receptacle.  How about that?  Are you a Lexus and a mouth with no voice box? 
[02:48:30]  That's everything I need.  Wake and go.  And I hope that you see.  That you're everything to me.  I'm a log the size of an eggplant.  I'm everything you need.  I'm asparagus tinkled.  Don't shut me out. 
[02:49:00]  Well, then open up your slash.  Yeah.  You know how you're on your way.  You'll be back with me someday.  Oh, baby.  I'm going to make you feel.  There's nothing more to feel.  Pretty mediocre.  It's just funny.  All right.  You get the idea.  It's not awful.  No, it's just there.  I'm everything you need if you're over 21 and you need a few years in prison.  That's me. 
[02:49:30]  All right.  Let's say hi to Eddie in Kansas.  Eddie.  Hey.  How's it going, fellas?  All right.  Eddie, can I ask you a question?  Yes.  You go right ahead.  If you're a Hulk's daughter and you hear your father sing, what makes you think that you  can do it?  I have no idea.  Does she have to look at him and go, Daddy, Hulkster in heaven is a good number?  I'll tell you.  It shows you how dry the well is for these people, though.  I mean, they're knocking off the Osbournes.  You got Hulk yelling in his wife's name, and Ozzy was always yelling, Sharon! 
[02:50:00]  I mean, how freaking far do they have to take this crap?  Dude, Ozzy, the difference is that's a consistent way for him.  He's been that way for years.  I mean, Ozzy, I have interviews from Ozzy in 81 where he's stumbling and stuttering  and muttering.  I mean, he's just a lunatic.  Hulk's ripping off Ozzy.  Tell him, Fred.  That's right.  Actually, Howard started the whole reality show craze.  Really?  That's what he says.  Yeah.  That's what he says.  He says his e-show started the whole reality show craze.  That's how delusional this man is. 
[02:50:30]  Started the whole thing robbing.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  Why don't we get back, Anthony?  Mm-hmm.  This could be really good.  You know how we've been doing the TV edits of really good movies?  Yeah.  We did, what, Smoking the Bandit yesterday?  Yep.  The Platoon and, you know, for the new listeners, basically, when a great movie goes on to TBS  or these other commercials.  Or your local WB affiliates.  Or whatever.  They've got to chop the crap out of the dialogue because you can't have curses.  Not allowed. 
[02:51:00]  And then words that are acceptable, they decide.  Hell and damn.  Aren't acceptable.  So they have these really bad, choppy things that they do to the dialogue.  And we've been giving you guys some examples the last few days.  Mm-hmm.  Well, when we get back, we took a classic Jim Norton rant and bit and cleaned it up for...  TV edit.  TV edit or regular radio, I guess, in this case.  Nice.  It has potential to be really good.  But first, ladies and gentlemen, Jay Moore. 
[02:51:30]  Yo, what's up, B?  What's going on?  I'm just...  Jay.  You know what I'm saying?  Hi, Jay.  Are you watching The Hogan Show?  No.  I'm watching Surreal Life, Celebrity Fat Club, and Whitney and Bobby.  Oh, that's what I hear.  Whitney and Bobby.  I saw some promos for that.  Looks hysterical.  Bobby's out of his mind.  Talking about pulling nuggets of shit.  Yeah.  Pulling nuggets of shit out of his wife's ass there. 
[02:52:00]  That's how we got black.  Yeah.  Who farted?  Jimmy!  Jay.  I saw rich...  What?  Jimmy just farted really bad in the middle of your fine phone call.  No, I didn't.  Yes, you did.  I got...  I just got...  Give me the benefit of the doubt.  You attention-seeking whore.  I didn't want attention.  I snuck it out quiet.  We were supposed to go to break.  Then all of a sudden, the phone rang.  The smell doesn't have a volume, Jimmy.  But Opie just said that we're going to break, so I just snuck it out.  I'm like, all right, I'll do that and go to the bathroom.  God, it smells like a bathroom.  It's an avalued listener cold. 
[02:52:30]  Did you fart because you were scared?  Well, the phone rang, and I just went, ah, and it just snuck out.  It startled me.  Did you get scared?  Whitney and Bobby, yes.  Go ahead, Jay.  I'm sorry.  Hey, nice home run derby last night.  That's really a thrill that they did it with all different countries.  I got to watch some Korean guy hit two and a half home runs.  You got, like, nine steroided out Americans from Southern California sitting on their ass  watching.  You get this big ape from Venezuela, wherever he was from, a brave who was 24. 
[02:53:00]  Then the Canadian gets up and hits zero.  That's pretty Canadian.  That's really Canadian.  What a great night for Canada.  I have no idea they did that.  Wait, they took players from all over the world?  Yeah, they made it international.  It includes everyone.  Yeah, but it doesn't because all the real guys, like, A-Rod couldn't be in it because  there's only one American.  Yeah.  And who was the American? 
[02:53:30]  Was it Manny?  Is there an American still playing Major League Baseball?  Me.  But, yeah, Bobby and Whitney, they're just complete crackheads.  It's fantastic.  And Whitney's wigs look like someone took a hatchet to the side of her head.  She's got a geranium on her head.  And he's just crackheads.  Yeah, he's a total crackhead.  He's the guy with the sign, I need help, but he's got a picture of, like, an eyeball for 
[02:54:00]  the letter I.  Yeah.  We've got to get audio from this show.  Hey, how do I get...  This is why I'm calling it.  It has nothing to do with the fact that I love the show when my son's up at 5 a.m.  Like, he's a little longshore fisherman for some reason.  How do I get photos from the Photoshop to have...  Like, someone did a picture of me, I don't know why, but me as Judas Priest.  Yeah.  Did you see that picture?  I did.  It's very funny.  Yeah, but I don't even know how... 
[02:54:30]  I guess it's Jay Morsh.  You had the X question mark?  Well...  Which, of course, yes.  And how do I...  Do you know how I get pictures?  You want to save it?  I want to own it.  I want it.  You want to save that picture?  It looks exactly like it's actually me.  Like, it's a really good job.  So you...  It looks like I decided to put on my Rob Halford coat and go party.  You have to right-click on the picture.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:55:00]  And say picture as.  You got it up there?  Do you have a Mac or a PC, sweetie?  I have a Dell.  Okay.  Yeah.  No, I'm joking.  I was listening to the whole Dell Rant.  Oh, those motherfuckers.  Those motherfuckers.  I like the Kentucky Fried Chicken.  Six bucks.  That's good.  See, I call in once a week, and I tell you guys everything you did to put it away.  Thank you, Jay.  Every time the show is more good, I give you a shot.  I can go, six dollars for a bucket of chicken is funny.  Do you think that the Hulk Hogan show is bad? 
[02:55:30]  As opposed to good?  He's shot in the gut.  It's my fault.  He's shot in the gut.  If we can just get in touch with Joe, Joe will make it right.  We need to calm down and rub some water on your face.  Goddamn.  The best Keitel ever.  Holy shit.  We need more pictures of me as Keitel on the Photoshop.  There's one as me as Keitel.  It's not very good.  Now, Jay, right-click on the picture, right? 
[02:56:00]  All right.  And then a menu pops up, and it says, save picture as.  You see that one?  And save picture as.  And then a little thing will come up, and you hit desktop.  You see that?  I'm on my computer now.  Oh.  I've got to go to the business center at the hotel.  He's not going to remember this.  Business center.  I stay at the Four Seasons in Vegas.  I'm opening for Celine Dion all year.  You don't bring a laptop?  I'm joking. 
[02:56:30]  I'm at home.  I'm on my door.  I thought that was an odd combo, but I'm like, yeah, you never know.  It could be, right?  I'm watching my kid put gasoline in his fire truck.  Hey, how good is Celebrity Fit Club, too, with Gary Busey?  I haven't seen it yet because I've been surrealized out because I want to fuck the shit out of Janice Dickinson.  She's out of her mind, though, huh?  I know, but she just looks like she needs to be fucking choked until she gets that little tear.  She's classic, too, because I guess on the next episode, they're going to bowl against Down Syndrome. 
[02:57:00]  Retards, and she calls them out.  She calls out the retard kids.  It was in the promo.  She's just abusing the hell out of them.  And then I guess Willie Ames or someone is having a problem with the fact that she's making fun of the retards.  You want to hear a scoop for who's going to be a guest star on Las Vegas?  Who?  And who what cast members don't come back?  Who?  The black girl.  Really?  They got Richard Lewis in an episode, and I told Cox, I said, 
[02:57:30]  you realize by hiring him, you just kept him off Celebrity Fit Club.  You just kept him off Surreal Life 4.  There's no reason for him to be on television.  I'm Richard Lewis, something, something of a Jew.  I told you, hold on, Debbie, don't get the juice stick.  Hold on, say cock.  Cock.  Oh, I'm trying to keep him with the voice. 
[02:58:00]  A cock.  Give me a minute, I'm on the phone with the boys.  And then we'll go spread the virus, me and you together.  Hold on one second.  We're going to go, brother.  Just give me two seconds.  All right.  Where are you going?  You're sticking out of your pajamas.  Come on, get it together.  Who's this guy?  Hey, how old's your kid now, Jay?  Fourteen.  He's two and a half.  You know what I'm thinking about?  When kids learn to speak, it's like the hardest thing in the world. 
[02:58:30]  Ever watch like Telemundo for a half hour?  Like you force yourself to try to figure out what the hell they're saying?  Yep.  That's what it's like to be one.  How much?  Car crash.  Yeah, I hope he gave you the crickets.  I'm in a car crash.  I like this one, actually.  Oh, good Lord.  What is it?  Oh, good Lord.  What's that from?  That's Kelsey Grammer.  Falling off a stage.  Falling off a stage?  He was doing a dramatic reading or something and fell in the middle of it? 
[02:59:00]  He went, oh, dear Lord, as he fell off the stage.  Oh, dear Lord.  Apparently he thought it was a 30-year-old eating by sharks.  What's that?  He had a brother eaten by sharks.  That's a true story, yeah.  It's all in my best-selling novel, Gatsby for Airtime.  Is it now in paperback?  Actually, I don't know if it is.  Yeah, it will be like within a week or two.  Very good.  But that's not why I called it.  I called it what the season of Odeon.  You know, Kelsey Grammer has had a lot of tragedy in his life. 
[02:59:30]  He's had a few brothers die.  But now he comes in Camille every night, so who cares?  One of his producers actually was on one of the flights, 9-11, one of Frazier's producers.  Yeah.  Wow.  And he was on a big babysitting scandal or something, right, where a babysitter in Jersey allegedly tapped.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I don't blame him.  Allegedly what?  Banging his babysitter.  That's been done.  Who did that?  Joe Piscopo did that, and so did Robin Williams.  Yeah. 
[03:00:00]  Got to tag that babysitter.  Oh, did Robin Williams do that?  Yeah.  He married her.  The nanny.  He married the nanny?  Yeah.  How about that?  I did not know that.  All right, Jay, they're saying we have to let you go, so...  Ben's saying he's got to...  Yeah, Ben has walked in the studio, and he's saying, let Jay be, so...  He's got a sense of entitlement now that everyone stole Drew Carey's big dick jokes and repeat  them over the air.  That is true.  That came out.  What?  All the Ben's hog jokes were... 
[03:00:30]  There's a whole chapter called My Dick So Big.  We are a part of it, and it is a part of us, and...  Yeah.  My dick so big, a homeless family lives under it.  And everyone's calling up like, I had a good one, guys!  So they all had the Drew Carey book.  Hey, Opie.  Yeah.  Wow.  Dude, he is laughing right now.  He nailed you.  I hate you.  Oh, wow, did he nail you.  That was a really good one.  That was a good one.  Ben wanted me to ask him about Frenchie. 
[03:01:00]  Why, Ben?  Jay just really wants to attack Frenchie.  I guess Frenchie was prank calling Jay or something like that.  Frenchie.  But for Bastille Day.  But Frenchie wants to have a big appearance again.  And he's ready to come back for his best steel day.  No one has thought of Frenchie in six months.  I know.  Talking about him like it was Bin Laden.  We're just...  All right.  Let's take a break.  When we get back, the Jim Norton...  Jim Norton, geez.  TV edit.  Jim Norton.  Jim Norton, TV edit.  On the way.  Like sends through the hourglass, so is the ONA virus. 
[03:01:30]  How many people said, you know, I was on, you know, at that restaurant at the top of the world.  Yeah, Windows on the World.  Windows on the World, you know, at the top of the, you know, the Twin Towers there.  When?  June?  Not now, not even.  1995.  Oh, really?  Like years ago?  Yeah, well, most of New York had...  Been up there?  Been up there to check it out.  I had the duck up there once.  It was lovely.  Very nice restaurant.  You know how many Midwestern people or people from Raleigh Carpenter said, 
[03:02:00]  we were going to go to New York then?  No.  We were going to go.  You were?  Where?  Finger legs.  Yeah.  Syracuse.  I kind of did that bit to Anthony yesterday.  I go, hey, I was thinking of going to London.  Yeah.  I was thinking of going there.  Well, really?  My God, you're tied right in.  Congratulations.  That's right.  You mean you thought of London?  Good thing you missed the bubonic plague of the 1500s.  Call good morning.  What was it?  13.  I think it was 12.  Call...  Ah, forget it.  I had a great mind, too.  Fuck it.  I had said it. 
[03:02:30]  Let us be the judge.  No, not now.  Why not?  It happens.  Fuck you.  Come on.  No one listens to this fucking program.  Spit it out.  That's not true.  I'm listening right now.  Spit it out.  Take a slig of coffee and let it rock like it was no...  Brand new.  Why?  I guarantee it was a good one, too.  Oh, well, the good ones stand up.  I was feeling it.  I was in the zone.  But no one fucking listens.  That's not true.  We listened.  The good ones stand up to these delays like this.  Nope.  The good ones stand up.  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me.  Nope.  The good ones stand up. 
[03:03:00]  I'd rather hear more Shining references.  Go ahead.  All right.  All right.  Jesus.  I'm so pissed right now.  I had a really good one.  I learned from past experiences that it's all about timing.  But you've got to give it out now.  I tried three times.  Listen to the replay.  All right.  All right.  Now.  Now.  No.  No, no.  Wait, wait, wait.  Not in the context that it is now a joke anymore.  Okay.  We realize the moment has passed.  But now you just have to tell us what it would have been.  I'm not going to.  You have to tell us what it would have been.  I'm not going to play your silly game. 
[03:03:30]  No.  We understand now that it's not going to be funny.  It's not the right time.  It's past.  Yeah.  But I kind of.  I got to know what it was going to be.  All work and no planning.  Greg and go boy.  It was a packed out of line.  Oh, see?  Now we enjoy that.  Of course it wasn't a packed out of line, you ass.  Come on.  I hate the pet battle thing, too.  Why?  We love pet battle.  What was it?  You can just tell us.  Shut up.  In the context of just the show.  Why didn't you think I was born?  But I really want to hear what it was going to be.  Do you think I just came out of college radio? 
[03:04:00]  Are you insane?  But it's not.  If you're doing it like saying this is what it was going to be.  What's the right?  I was going to expect you to get a laugh at this time.  I absolutely would tell you what it was going to be.  I started the line, I think, three times.  No.  Opie was starting to say, call good morning America.  I think he was going for the interview since he tied into the event by thinking about going  to London.  I have no idea what you're talking about, Matthew T. from Arizona.  You know what?  Was it some kind of.  Matthew T. is brilliant. 
[03:04:30]  Really?  Yeah.  It doesn't sound as good now, but yeah.  It was about, because I was thinking of going to London.  Right.  I called one of these new shows for my inclusive interview, but it was.  That was it?  Oh, he nailed it.  He nailed it.  Yeah, he nailed it.  Wow, Matthew.  Absolutely.  Holy shit.  That is really good.  Crazy.  Boy, that is a real.  See, Matthew is listening.  But it was all during the whole thing.  Of course.  It was just a quick thing.  It was just a quick chuckle. 
[03:05:00]  You fucking asshole.  I hate you, Matthew.  You fuckers.  You fuckers.  Opie and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best?  Ah, the latest from the Foo Fighters. 
[03:05:30]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program.  And some guy in a suit is in the studio. 
[03:06:00]  If it stinks in here, it's Jimmy.  The guy's been just blasting.  I dropped it before, but I haven't.  Yeah.  Well, you know something?  I noticed when I walked back in.  They don't just go away, Jimmy.  It really smells bad in here now.  I apologize.  It's embarrassing.  I went into the bathroom for a breath of fresh air.  It stinks in here.  It was a nice lady doing something here in the studio or in the office area, and she  was walking out as we were walking out.  And just as we're going into the bathroom, Jimmy just starts farting really bad.  And she actually went, thanks. 
[03:06:30]  It's awful.  She just went, thanks.  She was so disgusted.  I had to slow down so I wouldn't blow it in the bathroom.  I had to make sure I timed it right so I could sneak it out and then hide in the bathroom.  Knowing our luck, she's probably a bigwig in the XM company.  Yeah.  She was in charge of marketing just here talking about TV commercials.  She walked out.  Yeah.  Fuck it.  So introduce yourself, sir.  They don't have their TVs on right now.  They can't see you.  Yeah.  I also see what you have on here on your monitors.  Talks.  We go all over the place, though. 
[03:07:00]  We have to monitor everything.  Oh, is it going to change the channels?  Can you help us out a bit here?  Now, you guys, Ted David, CNBC, you guys, I know, were hanging around when McEnroe was  on.  You were over at the studio.  And I told Anthony a minute ago, I was like, as soon as I got off here, I was like running  around trying to find you guys.  Yeah.  But the virus has caught on in my house.  Yeah.  And you hate that fact, right?  My son here.  He's running to see Jimmy tonight.  I mean, it's like my whole house is just opening.  How old is your lad? 
[03:07:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, you're off mic, but yeah.  You look about 14.  What?  14.  How old are you?  14.  You look young, man.  You look really?  Yeah, it's cool.  No, how old are you?  20?  20?  There you go.  One more year to go, right?  Dude, I'm counting down the months.  I can't wait.  Then, you know, you don't have to adhere to all the rules.  That's it.  And Dad works for CNBC.  You can't be happy that your son's a fan of our show, huh?  You know what?  It's a free country.  Tell everybody what you do for CNBC. 
[03:08:00]  I'm an anchor.  I tell people how much money they're losing on any given day on Wall Street.  I, by the way, huge fan.  Yeah.  I watch all.  I hear you all the time talking about that.  I watch all the time.  Kramer, I know you're a fan of Kramer's.  That guy's insane.  He is.  And he is going to have a stroke live on the air someday.  But can you ever turn it off?  No.  No, right.  The guy's yelling all the time.  What are you, Kramer, what about GM?  GM, general.  And he's hitting the sound effects buttons.  He's sweating.  He's got to have a rag in his hand at all times.  He's blotting. 
[03:08:30]  But he changed his act, right?  He wasn't like that.  He used to do a show at Larry Kudlow.  Yeah, yeah.  And they were a little more conservative.  They were tamer.  You know what?  To be honest with you, I love it.  Yeah, that's fun.  I think he's getting some numbers on that show.  Definitely.  It's one of those new twists to the stock market.  Even Morning Call, you know?  You guys have kind of changed the stuffy attitude.  There's kind of jokes going back and forth.  I've got to tell you, I put the place on the air.  I know I sound like Robin.  I put the place on the air. 
[03:09:00]  Tell him, Fred.  Very good.  I actually did.  In 1989, I was one of the first anchors up there.  And I had been a disc jockey in New York and elsewhere.  And I used to just screw around.  Wait, slow down.  What kind of radio did you do?  You know, well, in New York, WPIX was top 40.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, a little top 40 jockey.  When they were love songs, nothing but love songs.  Actually, Disco 102 and that whole thing.  Can you talk up a record for us?  Any record.  As long as it's my genre.  Yeah, give me a song.  Without a hot clock. 
[03:09:30]  Without a hot clock.  Without a clock.  Don't need the clock.  Just give me something.  Jesus.  Wow, that's pretty good.  I'll give you a hot clock.  A 70s, 60s, 70s.  I got a hot clock.  A hot clock.  It's a hot clock.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Stop it.  Yes, please.  Listen, we promise that when I'm here, we've got to keep the clock.  Yeah, I understand.  We don't want to get you fired like we get other people fired.  No, no, no.  Let's see.  All right.  Yeah, because what he's talking about, those guys cheat when they're talking up the records.  Yeah.  They know when it's coming.  They can't even do that with a field.  They actually know how many seconds they've got.  I can post them without even looking.  Now, Eric's going to have to find one with a little bit of an intro. 
[03:10:00]  See these guys with the cartridges on them.  It's got 03, 05, 07.  Oh, yeah.  I know the deal.  Yeah.  You worked out on Long Island.  B.A.B.  I worked every station out there but B.A.B.  Out on Long Island, yeah.  Yeah, L.I.X., G.B.B., H.L.I., and then P.I.X. here.  You're one of those alphabet soup guys, man.  And NSR, Soft Rock, and 86.  What was 98.3?  They always played Soft Rock.  K.Joy, 98.3.  Wow.  I actually like that station.  All right, here we go.  It's going to talk up.  I don't even know what it is.  Don't tell me.  Just hit it.  Let's see if I know it. 
[03:10:30]  If I don't know it, then I've made a complete fool of myself.  No, that's a bold move, man.  That's a bold move.  I like it.  Let's see.  XM Radio with Opie and Anthony in the morning.  Everywhere on your radio.  202, they call it high voltage, I believe.  You can call it whatever you like, but we all like it.  Let's listen to this song, the title of which I have no idea,  but I'm going to shut up right now.  Come on.  That's good.  I posted it. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah.  Yep.  Wow.  Hot Nights by Donna Summer, I think.  Hot stuff.  Keep talking.  Home with little Jimmy Norton.  Here's Donna Summer and what is it?  Hot Nights?  Hot stuff.  He's got the feel.  All right, let's try that.  That's great.  All right, give me another artist.  Something in the 70s.  70s.  Give me an artist.  I do this at home for fun.  I've got like 2,000 mp3 sitting on my hard drive.  I have a couple of cocktails and my wife is in the other room  and I'm like playing CBS FM jingles and just having fun. 
[03:11:30]  CBS FM.  CBS.  Ron Lundy.  Hello, love.  Hello, love.  Yep.  Give me an.  It's a couple minutes past 11 o'clock at WABC.  Ron is a sweet guy.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Never met him.  A hotel in California.  That's a long intro.  A legendary doc.  Yeah, really?  Jesus.  I'd have to do the weather, the stock report, the headlines.  The hawk.  Jim Norton's latest.  You're appearing tonight, by the way, Jim, aren't you?  Well, I'm doing just this comedy show tonight, which I do every night.  The best place to see comedy in New York.  Don't just say just.  Well, it's only 20 minutes.  That's all right.  All right.  We need a cheesy band from the 70s that you would... 
[03:12:00]  Yeah, cheesy.  Eric, anything you would dance to, just click on it.  Go through your iPod.  Some ABBA.  Blondie?  Well, you know, Waterloo's only got four seconds.  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  No cold opens, please.  What is it with rolls of toilet paper in radio studios?  I said to my son, every place I've ever been, Scott.  That's all the cocaine the jocks do.  So they've got runny noses. 
[03:12:30]  All right, here, try this one.  Oh, my goodness.  Isn't it good to be back with Opie and Anthony on this Tuesday morning here in New York City?  If you're a newcomer to XM Radio, I am so happy you joined us.  I'm going to play a musical number for you that's actually right on Broadway right now.  It's part of a whole show involving this group, and this is just one of the songs.  It's Dancing Queen.  Here's ABBA.  Fantastic.  I bow to you. 
[03:13:00]  I really do.  He's doing that with just feeling it out.  I know.  You can't just do that.  He doesn't know how many seconds he has, but they won't let me do 20 minutes of that wherever.  Jimmy's appearing tonight, so I don't know how useful it is.  Yeah, jump up on stage with Jimmy.  Intro his bits that way.  You're going to laugh at this one.  This bit's hysterical.  This is a number involving prostitution.  Now, you know a little something about the stock market?  Yes.  Oh, thank you.  We've got CNBC on the monitor. 
[03:13:30]  Now it's up.  I appreciate that.  I'm seeing a little red.  What's that?  Serious?  Down 20 cents?  It's down 31 right now.  What happened?  But look at crude oil.  It's up $1.23.  Of course it is.  There you go.  The oil is screwing everything up.  What can you tell us about our Citadel stock, sir?  Oh, Citadel broadcast.  We're taking a bath.  Unclear.  Unclear at this time.  Unclear.  That's a good...  You will be rewarded.  We pull out the eight ball, you know.  Yeah, the eight ball.  Thanks.  We wanted to do that one day when a guest didn't show up, is just bring out the eight ball.  Just ask the eight ball questions.  Ask them the same questions.  Same answer.  Why not? 
[03:14:00]  That's a great idea.  We got into Citadel.  Funny thing, that guy's filling in for me right now.  Oh, you're supposed to be on right now?  Yeah, I'm on vacation this week.  Oh, okay.  Citadel, we picked it up.  We got in on the IPO.  Ground floor.  How did you do that?  $19 a share.  Nine shares it now.  Two, three.  It said $12 a share.  Yeah, that's wonderful.  Fareed over there at Citadel.  Yeah.  Thank you.  We thought it was a guarantee.  Well, of course, I'm getting in on the IPOs.  We are losing.  Yeah, that's what we said last time. 
[03:14:30]  It said we got in on the ground floor, but didn't know there was 30 levels of basement  in this building.  Horrid.  Yeah, definitely.  All right.  Hey, is I-Mas over there at CNBC?  No, MSNBC.  No, MSNBC.  They're at a different venue.  Everyone gets that confused, don't they?  CNBC and MSNBC.  A different venue.  And C-SPAN.  Yeah.  Yes.  How's Donnie Deutsch doing?  Good.  He's over there, right?  Donnie's a good guy.  Is he getting ratings for that show?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's got-  You know, we did an interview and they never aired it?  Yeah, that one we did when we were over at the studios. 
[03:15:00]  They never aired that one.  It's kind of a weird timing issue.  I did a thing with him, too, and I don't know whether that was part of rehearsals or  what, or they wanted to change the direction of the show or whatever.  They wanted us to redo it because we talked about a couple of things that weren't timely  anymore, and we were like, eh, forget it.  Just edit that part out.  Yeah, they talked to us, and then we were going to broadcast it weeks later, and by that  time, yeah.  All the stories we talked about were old, so.  Wasn't Chevy Chase on the one you were on?  Yeah.  Did they run the Chevy Chase one?  Because we were supposed to be on that same day.  I don't know.  He came in with his pink sweater. 
[03:15:30]  What a, just a pompous, miserable man Chevy is.  He has turned into just a miserable man.  He used to be the funny guy.  What happened?  He gets up there, and I saw him doing the Deutsche interview, and it was just, oof, cringe-like.  You know, what was interesting was Art Garfunkel when he was up there.  You know, Vic Cabot used to do a show at CNBC a million years ago, and he created some  top names, and some of the people were just, you know.  Asses?  Yeah.  That's the word? 
[03:16:00]  If I may say without embarrassing, you're a strikingly handsome man.  I've been telling him that for years.  I'm so happy somebody else noticed that.  It was?  Is this on?  Can I?  Yeah, yell at your father.  Dude, this is national.  But you told me something about being taken with his 30-inch waist.  Listen, I...  Or were you quoting Norton?  I got it.  Oh, I'm not taken with it, but sometimes you just see something that's sculptured, and  you're like, my God, that's nice.  Absolutely.  Well, thank you, I guess. 
[03:16:30]  A bunch of men just looking at you.  Opie, comment on his nice tan.  Yeah, is that a fake tan?  No, I was out with my wife after Montauk yesterday with Top Down.  Oh, look at that.  Oh, Top Down Montauk.  Top Down, everybody.  Look at you.  Living the life.  Top Down, Top Down for a Beach Boys, too.  And can you find one?  Yeah, I don't think so.  How do they treat you over there?  Nice?  CNBC?  Pay you some good cake?  Love it.  Love it.  Great place.  Yeah?  It really is.  Yeah.  You've been there how long?  I'm into year 17.  Jesus.  Who even knew it was there that long?  Well, there you go.  That was part of the problem.  Wow, that must have been something in the early years. 
[03:17:00]  I really thought CNBC's been around four years.  Yeah.  I would have thought.  Maybe five.  We went on here in 1989, April 17th, 1989.  Wow.  And then we bought FNN, which is the Financial News Network, which is like nobody ever heard  of.  I mean, cable back then.  Yeah.  When we moved into our first house in 1981, there was this wire coming out of the wall, and it  was like, what is that?  Yeah.  And nobody knew what it was.  I plugged it into the set and got HBO and a bunch of this neat stuff, and FNN was on  there.  We ended up buying them.  Stock market went nuts, and we evolved. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah.  All right, we've got a Beach Boys song.  Is this a cold open, though?  Help me, Rhonda.  What is it, darling?  Well, Since You Put Me Down would be the first line on that, and that's a cold open.  It would be a great seg out of a jingle.  Holy crap.  It's like Radio Idiot Savant.  Wow, that's great.  Man.  Give me a Beach Boys song that has an intro.  I can't think of one offhand.  What's a cold open?  It just starts singing quickly?  It starts singing right away.  Immediately.  There's nothing you can do with it as a jock.  And you've got a cold ending where it just ends like that.  How about a...  Give me one with a little intro.  Kokomo? 
[03:18:00]  No, that's...  Aruba, Jamaica, I believe that.  Actually, Kokomo does have an intro.  It's probably seven seconds.  Now, go with that one.  Yeah, this one definitely has some time to it.  All right, if we do a time check in weather, here we go.  Oh, my goodness.  Let's take it back to the 60s.  Morning, morning, Bob.  Harry Harrison, CBS FM.  Morning, where all the good songs are gone.  It's 10.30 on a Tuesday morning in New York City, and it is hot and hazy and humid.  But we don't care, do we, Anthony?  Or Opie and Anthony.  Or Jimmy Norton.  Because we're all going to the beach.  The Beach Boys. 
[03:18:30]  And they're going to keep vamping for a minute, and we're going to do this right now.  We're going to take you all around the country with the Beach Boys.  Now you know why I got out of the radio.  No shit.  That's without a clock.  Wow.  Mr. Bridges.  Yes, sir.  Oh, how you doing?  Oh, there he is.  Hello, sir.  Sorry to make you wait.  It's Bo Bridges, everyone.  Hey, Opie and Anthony.  What are we doing getting actual Hollywood stars on our show?  We don't know how to talk to a real Hollywood star. 
[03:19:00]  We get the phony types.  How you guys doing?  Very good.  Good.  What do you got going for yourself these days?  Well, I'm doing Stargate.  Stargate?  Yeah.  Sci-fi.  Sci-fi show.  They're in their ninth season, and I'm joining them as General Hank Landry.  Nine years that show's been on?  Yeah.  Jesus, where does the time go?  I know.  Nine seasons.  And now you're joining the cast.  Is it the Stargate or Stargate Atlantis or Stargate CSI or? 
[03:19:30]  Stargate SG-1.  SG-1.  That's the original one.  That's right.  And is MacGyver still on that show?  Richard came in and did like a couple of scenes and a couple of episodes, but he's sort of opting out of it.  Wow.  Why would he leave?  He's doing very well with that.  Well, nine years, you know.  He helped create the show, and I don't know.  You'd have to ask Richard.  Wow.  Okay.  Put him on.  No? 
[03:20:00]  Not there?  I've been a big fan ever since the incident.  I didn't see it live.  I mean, I was born in 68.  But I've got to say, that's a fine film.  Yeah, that was a crazy one about the subways in New York, huh?  Yeah, Martin Sheen's first film.  That was his actual first film with Tony Missante, and Bo Bridges played the guy who got involved.  Ed McMahon.  Was that Ed McMahon's only film ever?  Tom and Carol and Bob Carroll and Ted Mills.  I think maybe certainly his only dramatic forte. 
[03:20:30]  Now, you've been acting for a long time, and a friend of mine and I were talking about a lot of the way the movies are.  And it seems like a lot of the stress is no longer put on acting because a lot of the stuff like affection, all that stuff.  A lot of the stress, you say?  Well, the effects, it seems like, have kind of replaced what used to be, you have to act.  Like, in the 60s, you had to act because there was nothing to cover up anything.  That's why a lot of you guys from those days are great.  And it seems like today, there's so many effects and other things that will just cover up for a lack of, like, you know, what would have passed back then. 
[03:21:00]  Well, hopefully they won't, you know, where it all ends, they'll digit, I can't even pronounce the word, digitalizes.  Or, yeah, digitize.  Either one is good, especially on this show.  I'll have to get into voiceovers or something.  You've done a lot of great work.  He was in Norma Rae, Grease Light, and you just had a fantastic career.  I mean, what did you start in, 48?  It was, like, your first role?  Yeah, I think around that time I was in a film called Zamba, which comes on, on TV every once in a while, 
[03:21:30]  where I was chasing around in the jungle with a gorilla named Zamba.  Ah, Zamba the gorilla, sure.  There's lots of me calling out, Zamba, Zamba.  Now, obviously you're Jeff's brother.  Every role he plays lately, it just seems like he plays a complete maniac.  He's nothing like that, I would hope.  No, now, my mother wouldn't like to hear you say that, because he also played the president of the United States. 
[03:22:00]  Did he?  Pretty calm and collected in that one.  I can't look at him.  Yeah, he does like those crazy guys, doesn't he?  I can't look at him without thinking of the remake of The Vanishing with Keeper Sutherland.  Oh, yeah.  He was frightening, then.  I liked that one.  That was pretty bizarre.  He got hit with the space and the shovel goes into his face and all that.  Hey, have you seen any of his performances from the Dinah Shore show?  Mm-mm.  Any of your brother's performances?  No, I haven't.  I remember him doing that.  Yeah, we recently got a DVD, and it's a bunch of singing performances by celebrities on the Dinah Shore show. 
[03:22:30]  Oh, yeah.  He must have been like 16 or 17.  Oh, my God.  Well, I don't know.  He had this big head of hair and beard.  I think it was during King Kong.  Uh-huh.  Might have been during that one.  Oh, okay.  So he wasn't like a kid.  No, no.  No, but it was one of those performances that are kind of like, oof.  Yeah, he's gotten into music quite a bit.  He came out with an album with Michael McDonald recently.  Really? 
[03:23:00]  That he wrote a lot of the music.  Jeff wrote a lot of the music for and stuff.  He's always loved music, yeah.  Do you guys have any competitive stuff going?  Because, I mean, you know, you're both very, very famous and both very respected actors.  Not really, because, you know, first of all, we both feel quite blessed and fortunate to have been able to make a living in this business, which is such a crazy biz.  And also, I'm a bit older than Jeff, so in a lot of ways, because my dad was traveling a lot with work when we'd stay home as kids, I would do a lot of the father stuff with him. 
[03:23:30]  So I've kind of, you know, I enjoy all of his successes and so forth, because I taught him everything he knows.  Well, you're also very musical.  I mean, it says here in the bio that you play guitar.  I'm not particularly musical.  Yeah, I love music.  I do.  I like to play it.  I'm not quite like when Jeff and I did the Fabulous Baker Boys together. 
[03:24:00]  Ah, yes.  Some of those piano guys, we played all our own piano in it, but Jeff can really, I mean, he still can play all of Dave Grusin jazz music for that, and I had to just kill myself to learn a few bars.  I can, like, I can chord with my left hand and play melody with my right, so I'm okay at parties for an hour or so, but that's about it.  Hey, Bo, how's your son Todd doing?  We haven't heard from him in a while. 
[03:24:30]  Todd.  Yeah, I think Todd's not my son, but he's, from what I understand, he's doing okay now, Todd Bridges.  Yeah, but a lot of people think he's my son, but no.  No, huh?  No.  I think that's great that you're still going strong in this new thing, because I do a little bit of acting, too, although I'm not particularly very good.  I tend to, like, just make eye contact with the camera, and then the director has to go talk.  Yeah, that's the first thing you don't want to do.  Are you Meisner or Method?  Can I ask you that?  What is that? 
[03:25:00]  Am I rich?  Either or, Meisner or Method actor?  Well, my dad was my teacher, and he was, you know, sort of a Stanislavski guy, you know, the Stanislavski method.  So I learned a lot of that path from him.  Stanislavski?  Yes.  As opposed to Boleslavski, which was another Method actor.  Really?  Now, Boleslavski.  Geez, now you're talking.  Oh, my God.  We got an anchor from CNBC in the studio today, sir, and he's boring the hell out of us. 
[03:25:30]  Yeah, Boleslavski, in fact, I just gave my nephew a book written by him.  He was one of Stanislavski's students, and he wrote a book called Acting, the First Six Lessons, and it's a great one.  You ought to get it.  It's fun.  The first lesson is do not look into the camera.  Oh, that's what I kind of do.  I try to, like, avoid all voice inflection and emotion.  I figure just spit the words out quickly and then let the audience decide what I meant.  There you go. 
[03:26:00]  Hey, how do you feel?  I mean, again, I would classify you as an absolutely real actor and, like, an old school guy.  How do you feel about all the remakes and all just the shit that they're throwing out at people?  Well, I mean, I've certainly done my share of shite.  And, you know, I think the most important aspect to any entertainment that tells a story is the story itself.  If it's a good one, then it probably will be retold several times. 
[03:26:30]  What goes through your mind when you're part of a project that you just know is awful, but you're under contract and you've got to, you know, get it done?  Well, it's odd. For me, that's never really happened because I think the whole nature of what I do being an actor kind of requires of you total commitment when you jump in there.  Right.  And so by the time that the camera's rolling, I'm pretty much on board. 
[03:27:00]  But aren't there times you just know, uh-oh, I got myself into something here?  No, maybe later on, you know, if you see one that's a stinker, you know.  Come on. Greased lightning?  It hurts.  That was a good one with Richard Pryor.  Richard Pryor, of course. I was going to ask about that.  Did you get along with Pryor? Because he legendarily gets along with no one.  You can dig a lot deeper into the craft than that one.  What's that?  You can dig a lot deeper into the craft than that one, he says.  Yeah, that was Richard Pryor's first kind of main thing. 
[03:27:30]  Yeah, it was like a real serious role for him as Wendell Scott. Did you enjoy working with him or was he brutal?  No, he was wonderful in that movie. Yeah, he was just great.  Okay, that's probably before he got jaded and miserable on coke.  I liked you as Warren Tucker in Sea Hunt episode Storm Train. Don't you love Internet Movie Database?  You actually were in an episode of Sea Hunt with your dad.  Yes, I played a jewel thief in that one.  Really?  Who escapes into a storm drain after I pull off the heist, and then Mike Nelson, my dad, dives into the sewer to save me. 
[03:28:00]  Ah.  I used to watch that as a kid all the time, Sea Hunt.  Yeah, sure.  Hey, Bo.  Me too.  Got a question for you, and I bet Anthony will recall this too.  It seemed like every episode at some point in Sea Hunt involved somebody getting behind your dad and cutting his ear hose.  A violent underwater fight, his ear hose gets cut, right?  That's right.  What was the whole storyline to that?  What was your dad's character in that? 
[03:28:30]  Well, he was like a, I think he was, was he an ex-coast guard guy or something that was just sort of,  but he was just like a detective, and he would go out and solve crimes on the water.  Underwater detective.  How many underwater crimes are happening?  But in doing so, he was all in underwater, and he really introduced a lot of people across the country and the world to underwater stuff.  And, you know, he and Jacques Cousteau kind of came along at the same time. 
[03:29:00]  Cousteau, of course, in the scientific area, my dad.  I had a Sea Hunt moment, Bo.  Oh, did you?  What happened?  I was scuba diving, and I beat up a Frenchman 60 feet underwater once.  Did you pull out his arrow?  No, I just punched him a few times, and then we were wrestling and stuff in slow motion underwater.  It's a true story.  It's the only way to wrestle underwater is slow motion.  I was scuba diving, and this Frenchman who was just being a complete ass on the boat before we dove,  wasn't paying attention to anything.  It was his first dive, and he just came down way too fast and landed on top of me, 
[03:29:30]  so I decided the best way to take care of this was to punch him in his face underwater.  Geez, well, Jacques Cousteau wouldn't like that very much.  So we had kind of a sea hunt, slow motion fight underwater.  It was great.  Excellent.  I wish I could have been there.  Now, you did Norma Ray in 79, and a great film, and Ron Liebman was in that.  What is Ron Liebman doing?  I haven't seen Ron in a long time.  He's a good guy, and I actually worked again with him after that. 
[03:30:00]  I cast him in a movie that I directed, and he was wonderful.  He's always great when he's out there.  Yeah, he did a very funny film by Mad Magazine called Up the Academy.  Oh, I didn't see that one.  I remember that one, sure.  So are you looking for any young actors?  Because, I mean, I would definitely like to do some Hollywood acting work.  You know, I'd like, I wouldn't mind considering you,  but I'd like you to send me some footage of you  where you could actually say something without looking into the camera. 
[03:30:30]  That's very important to me.  See, Jimmy?  I don't think you have any of that.  No, but a lot of times I like to hold the paper,  but I always make sure, like, I'm holding a newspaper  so, like, the audience doesn't see that I'm actually reading off the script.  I know how to hide it around the set.  And, Beau, Jim was in Spider-Man, the first one.  Oh, yeah, I had one line in Spider-Man.  What did you say?  Well, I was the pivotal turning point in the film.  I was a man on the street, and they said,  what do you think of Spider-Man?  I said, he stinks, and I don't like him.  And I was, uh...  Got it, you're lying right here.  He stinks, and I don't like him. 
[03:31:00]  That was my line.  That was the actual line from Spider-Man.  Is that how you said it?  Yeah, well, I was just kind of...  I was exasperated.  That was me playing exasperated.  So you had more...  On the actual take, you had more exasperation than there.  Yeah, I used a little bit of spunk.  I didn't even get to meet Sam Raimi.  It was all his second unit shoot in Queens.  Spunk, you know, spunk is really on the way out.  You've got to get rid of the spunk.  Yeah, here Pepe is making a comeback, and spunk is...  Pepe is better, yeah.  I like playing lexadaisical.  Ooh.  Sure. 
[03:31:30]  Well, Beau, thank you for joining us.  What, again, because they're saying that we've got to get you out of here,  but what is the name of the...  Stargate.  Stargate.  Stargate.  Stargate.  Stargate.  Stargate and all that stuff.  Sg1.  Sg1.  And it's going to be on the Sci-Fi channel, of course, Fridays at 9 p.m.  We're going after the aliens before they get us.  That's it, zipping through our time.  Oh, that little War of the Worlds tie-in.  Look at you.  There you go.  All right.  Thank you, Beau.  Thank you, Mr. Bridges.  Good talking to you guys.  Have a great day.  You too.  Beau Bridges, everyone. 
[03:32:00]  Bye-bye.  That's a big Hollywood star, that guy, right there.  Jeff, his brother.  In studio.  Right?  Lloyd.  Dad Lloyd.  How long is this?  Unfortunately, Lloyd's last movie was Jay Moore's Mafia.  Ah.  Not that I didn't enjoy Jay Moore and Mafia, Jay.  Hi, Jay.  Hi, Lloyd.  I see that sometimes in gas stations.  As I'm stopping off at an Exxon, and I realize that there's no hole drilled in between the  two booths, and I have to go in there and actually do some shopping. 
[03:32:30]  I mean, I'll actually, if I can't meet anyone, I'll buy a movie.  So, Mafia is always like the one they have a bunch of copies in the Exxon of, which is  good.  Yeah, sure.  It's opening up to a new market.  Yeah, why not?  People that need gas.  Yeah, absolutely.  All right.  What are you looking at?  What do we got there?  Oh, that's all it is?  Okay.  We can do this.  We're going to do an ONA TV edit thing.  Yeah, I want to hear this.  This is Jimmy. 
[03:33:00]  Jim Norton talking to Dragon Wagon, I think.  The famous Dragon Wagon bit.  Yeah.  No, no, no, no.  No?  What?  Hawk?  Oh, Hawk.  Oh, he went with the other one?  What have you done?  No, they said they might go with the other one.  This is a...  But it's Hawk's fault.  It is.  It always is.  It is.  I know he's taking mics away from the guests.  Why are eight people walking in here while you remove a mic from an anchor?  Here we go.  Hold on.  No, but that's his son.  Show respect to his son.  Talk into mine.  Mind, sir?  No, no.  Talk into mine.  All right.  So the Dragon Wagon was a little too long and didn't have enough variety in the language, 
[03:33:30]  so we went with a different bit that Danny selected.  What bit is this?  Oh, look at it.  Now, wait a minute.  That just was very telling.  I know what that is.  Daniel is not confident in this at all.  I have the utmost confidence.  No, you said which Danny chose.  But there's some, you know, discussion as to who contributed to what and people not getting  credit, and I think Danny selected an excellent pitch.  You would absolutely not give Danny credit.  No.  You wouldn't say you did it if he didn't do it, but you wouldn't step up and actually give 
[03:34:00]  him the credit.  I have the utmost confidence in this.  All right.  What's the bit?  It's a Jim yelling at a caller that just said he wasn't funny.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  And it's done in the TV edit style.  You know how they put movies on regular television.  They've got to edit out the language, and a lot of times they use ridiculous words for  the curses.  The voice is different.  The ambient noise in the background is different, and it's ridiculous.  Right.  And we just decided to try one of these with a little segment of our show. 
[03:34:30]  All right.  Here's Jim Norton, the original line.  Wait.  Hey, guys.  Oh, you're killing me.  Nathaniel wanted to say something.  Did he?  No, it's okay.  Oh, he was going to talk into the microphone.  Fucking asshole.  But he was going to talk into the mic.  You got me so bad.  No, he actually was trying to talk into the mic, and he got shy, and he walked away.  All right.  Here's the original dialogue.  All right.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Long time listener.  Glad to have you back.  Love you.  Jeff, welcome to the program.  Hey, uh, you've got to tell you, you've got to get rid of Norton.  Dump this guy because he sucks. 
[03:35:00]  What?  Uh-oh.  That was the first line?  That's the first line, and now we're going to clean it up for TV.  Wow.  Steve, you have confidence in this?  Green Goblin face made a really good choice in there, didn't he?  Dumbbell.  Did you have picked one with profanity in it, Daniel?  All right.  It's just the first one.  But the whole point is you've got to clean it up, and there's nothing wrong with it.  I'm thinking sucks.  All right, Steve, explain yourself.  We used, if I may make a local reference, Channel 11 rules. 
[03:35:30]  Where they couldn't use sucks.  Can't use sucks.  All right.  Let's listen to the original.  All right.  One more time.  I just got confused because I didn't know what they were going to redo here.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Long time listening.  Glad to have you back.  Love you.  Jeff, welcome to the program.  Hey, uh, you've got to tell you, you've got to get rid of Norton.  Dump this guy because he sucks.  What?  All right.  So that's the original.  All right.  What a dope.  Boy, I'm greeting him happily.  Yeah, I know.  Asshole.  You feel stupid. 
[03:36:00]  I hope he's dead.  And here's that same line cleaned up for Channel 11.  Local broadcast.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Long time listening.  Glad to have you back.  Love you.  Jeff, welcome to the program.  Hey, uh, you've got to tell you, you've got to get rid of Norton.  Dump this guy because he stinks.  What?  All right.  I kind of like it.  It was very good execution, by the way.  The sound was a little off.  The voice wasn't the same.  But his attitude was the same. 
[03:36:30]  You try to actually get the guy's angry attitude.  This is actually a lot harder than you'd think because you have to sit there and say it exactly  how Norton delivers the line.  All right.  Forget it.  You really need to explain?  Nope.  Jesus.  I don't.  All right, here's the reason.  My motivation was.  I know.  Every time he opens his mouth, he drains the funny from the room.  Whoa, easy there, Jeff. 
[03:37:00]  I got to tell you, hey, Norton, Bob Kelly was on the other day.  I couldn't tell the difference between him and you.  Get a new shtick, buddy.  You stole it from him.  You're a one-trick pony.  Yeah, your mother's a one-trick pony, too.  When I give her money, she sucks my dick and eats my ass.  You fucking fan with an opinion.  Your mother's a trick-turning pony.  She sucks horse cock while bad 70s music plays.  And then funny little troll.  God, Jim's just proven that he's actually funny there.  Wow. 
[03:37:30]  That's not really what I meant to say.  No, no.  He just kind of slipped out.  A little harsh.  Well, Steve cleans this up for a local broadcast.  Every time he opens his mouth, he drains the funny from the room.  Whoa, easy there, Jeff.  I got to tell you, hey, Norton, Bob Kelly was on the other day.  I couldn't tell the difference between him and you.  Get a new shtick, buddy.  You stole it from him.  You're a one-trick pony.  Yeah, your mother's a one-trick pony, too.  When I give her money, she shines my shoes and heeds my words.  You flipping fern with an opinion. 
[03:38:00]  Your mother's a tried-and-true pony.  She sings punk rock while bad 70s music plays.  It's funny little troll.  All right, I'm standing up for enough.  Bravo.  Martini's team.  Very good.  Oh, wow.  That is perfect.  That's exactly how they do it in the movies.  That's exactly how they do it in the movies.  Because you have to read.  You have to exactly figure out Jimmy's delivery the original time.  Run through that a few times.  Holy crap, that's funny.  Think of what you'd be looking at on a screen, and then think of words that would match up with 
[03:38:30]  what he's saying.  All the bad fake curses and everything.  Bad that don't make sense.  What did I say last one?  Your mother does what with a pony?  The final...  I forgot.  Fern?  I think there was a fern in there, too.  Yeah, there's a fern reference.  Fern.  Wait, I can play the last...  Yeah.  You know these Denons, right?  You can play the last five seconds of the track?  No?  It's used to records.  Every time he...  You flipping fern with an opinion.  Your mother's a tried-and-true pony.  She sings punk rock while bad 70s music plays. 
[03:39:00]  You're an unfunny little troll.  That is really good.  Sings punk rock.  That's really good.  If I had any real sense of humor, that's what I would have said to begin with.  Yes.  That would have shown him.  All right, let's...  Here's the original line.  There's more to this bit.  You're an unfunny little troll, buddy.  That's the best you have, unfunny little troll?  I say your mother sucks pony dick on film, and you call me a troll?  Do I trip trap under a bridge?  Drop dead, motherfucker. 
[03:39:30]  All right, let's see how Steve cleaned this up for a local broadcast.  Do we have to do this with a news anchor here?  I'm a little embarrassed and ashamed of my potty mouth.  You're an unfunny little troll, buddy.  That's the best you have, unfunny little troll?  I say your mother strips furniture on film, and you call me a troll?  Do I trip trap under a bridge?  Drop dead, Mr. Falcon.  Hey, he stole that.  I'm diehard, too.  That's great. 
[03:40:00]  Steve, you've got to do another one.  We will.  You've hit a home run here.  Let's say hi to Vic in Connecticut.  Vic?  Vic?  Hey, Vic.  What's happening?  Hey.  I don't usually call shows, but that was awesome.  Unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  I'm cracking up, and Mr. Falcon, unbelievable.  All right, thanks.  Martini, Steve's best bit ever from Philly.  Look at this.  They're loving it.  That was a good one, man.  Well, there's still a little more here before we end the show. 
[03:40:30]  I'm not a professional.  You're a professional.  You're not a professional.  You're a fucking nobody.  You're an anonymous zero.  All right.  And now cleaned up for local broadcast.  I'm not a professional.  You're a professional.  You're not a professional.  You're a faking nobody.  You're an anonymous zero.  Faking.  That really does.  You've definitely hit on what they do on television.  Here's the original dialogue.  I may suck, but your mother swallows and takes it on the face. 
[03:41:00]  Hey, my mother may take it on the face, but at least she's funnier than you, motherfucker.  She's not funnier than me.  The only thing funnier about her is she's a woman with a cock.  That's what's funny about your mother.  And she dangles it over your father's face like a Roman war helmet.  How the hell are you going to clean up this one?  Oh, my goodness.  This was the most challenging bit we had.  Yes.  Nathaniel and I both did VO parts in this one.  I may stink, but your mother swats flies and shaves her face.  My mother might shave her face, but at least she's funnier than you, Mike Foxtrot. 
[03:41:30]  She's not funnier than me.  The only thing funnier about her is she's a woman with a beard.  That's what's funny about your mother.  And she dangles it over your father's face like a rug from Persia.  I like Nathaniel.  I had to play the part of the angry caller.  Anyone else pick up on that?  Very good.  Very good.  All right.  We're running out of show.  We want to get to the end of this.  The original dialogue.  You're the worst, man.  I may be the worst, but I'm well paid and you're a listener.  So sit there, boy, and listen. 
[03:42:00]  Put on your headphones and listen, little fella.  I drained the funny out of a room the way your mother drained semen out of black cocks.  Where'd he go?  I don't think he could take it.  By the way, the CNBC anchor left, I don't know, a half hour ago at least.  At least.  All right.  Here's that same dialogue cleaned up for TV.  You're the worst, man.  I may be the worst, but I'm well paid and you're a listener.  So sit there, boy, and listen. 
[03:42:30]  Put on your headphones and listen, little fella.  I drained the funny out of a room the way your mother drinks seltzer on the rocks.  Where'd he go?  I don't think he could take it.  Excellent.  Wow.  I do like it.  Unbelievable, Steve.  Thank you, Nathaniel, as well.  This was a group effort.  And Danny picked the bit.  Very good.  If I could do another one for tomorrow, it's too good. 
[03:43:00]  Okay.  We'll do this again tomorrow.  We'll replay this one because we couldn't spend too much time on this.  I need to take criticism a little better.  Yeah, you do.  You are a lunatic.  I'm just a jerk.  You're a crazy person, Jimmy.  All right.  We're running out of show here.  I want to thank the CNBC guy for coming in and leaving with his son.  Grabbed his son by the collar and ran out of here.  Jesus.  All right. 
[03:43:30]  Can't stop laughing.  Look at that.  Everybody is chiming in now.  There isn't one bad review.  Dude, right there.  The second one down.  Cleveland Odeon, July 23rd.  Second show tickets available on Ticketmaster.  Thank you, sir, whoever you are.  Tomorrow, real fast, though, the Wow Ride with Keith the Cop.  If you want to go on the Wow Ride from New York to Philly, you've got to be here before  730 in New York City, 57th Street between 6th and 7th Avenue, 111 57th Street.  What?  What?  This concludes our podcast day.  You'll be an Anthony show. </pre>
