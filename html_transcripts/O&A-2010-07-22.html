<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with the hosts' typical vulgar banter, sparked by Opie's frustrating encounter with a slow-driving cab driver, which devolved into a discussion of road rage and ethnic stereotypes.  This was followed by opinions on basketball, neck tattoos, and an article declaring Thursday the angriest day of the week.  A news story about a whale crashing into a sailboat led to crude jokes, and a surprise call from the cab driver himself resulted in further insults.  Bobby Bigrigger then called in to discuss Jimmy Norton's Tonight Show appearance.

A substantial portion focused on the location-based app Foursquare, with callers struggling to explain its appeal while the hosts provided sarcastic and offensive commentary. Google Street View and Google Earth images were discussed, including one near Opie's house that fueled speculation about infidelity.  A caller brought up the website "Please Rob Me," highlighting the security risks of Foursquare.  The hosts briefly dismissed a news story about a waterspout.  The segment concluded with discussions of Colin Quinn's one-man show, "Puppetry of the Penis," Selena Gomez's 18th birthday,  Opie's violent fantasy involving a woman in a sundress, "sharking" videos, and a call about a possible Ron & Fez incident involving Fez and a microphone.

The next segment centered on the Naked Cowboy's lawsuit against Sandy Kane, who was a guest on the phone.  The hosts discussed the details of the suit, with Sandy Kane defending herself against the Naked Cowboy's accusations of brand infringement.  She mentioned her upcoming CD.  Callers weighed in on the lawsuit, discussing Selena Gomez and other Disney stars.  Ron the Lawyer joined the call, offering legal analysis and largely supporting Sandy Kane.  A heated debate ensued between the Naked Cowboy and Sandy Kane, with Ron the Lawyer mediating.  He ultimately advised the Naked Cowboy to drop the suit to avoid bad publicity.

A subsequent segment heavily featured Sandy Kane and brainstorming ideas for a "naked schoolgirl" makeover, involving pigtails, braces, and a Catholic schoolgirl outfit.  They discussed finding a makeup artist, potentially even a mortician, to achieve a younger look. Sandy Kane, initially claiming to be 47, expressed interest in the makeover.  This segment also featured Ron the Lawyer's previous controversial audio, praised by the hosts, along with studio guest Colin Cain.  Other topics included Arnold Schwarzenegger's joke about Mel Gibson, speculation about Mel Gibson's erratic behavior, a listener's story about a flasher, complaints about bed bugs, and a dengue fever commercial.

The following segment began with a bizarre anecdote about Indian rat worship, transitioning into negative experiences with convenience store clerks, particularly those of Arab and Middle Eastern descent.  A discussion about bed bugs led to a lengthy, explicit conversation about pornography consumption habits.  A viral video of a father intervening in his daughter's 4chan cyberbullying was analyzed, followed by discussions of various internet videos, including "Meatspin," a male cheerleader video, videos of individuals with extreme synthol injections, "Numa Numa Kid," "Chocolate Rain," and "Winnebago Man." A caller detailed the dangers of synthol.  The segment concluded with a call about shooting animals in the Philippines and a discussion of a video of a man with an enlarged scrotum, finally culminating in the hosts' viewing and reaction to "Meatspin."

The final segment featured a caller, Danny, with testicular pain.  Dr. Steve, a guest doctor, guided Danny through a self-examination, suggesting epididymitis.  The conversation became vulgar and sexually explicit.  Dr. Steve gifted Anthony a pistol and discussed other gifts exchanged between them.  A bizarre caller question about onion skin and female genitals was deferred to Dr. Steve's show.  A homophobic discussion about Mythbusters and American Pickers followed, along with further discussions of Synthol injections and a man with a large penis from a previous show.  The segment concluded with discussions of television habits and the rejection of a prank call to a Chinese restaurant.  Sandy Kane, the Naked Cowboy, and Ron the Lawyer were mentioned as previous guests.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Yeah, come on. Bring it on.  You know what? I think this is hilarious.  A whole big bunch of fun.  The greatest show on satellite radio today.  This show is like the box of chocolates. 
[00:00:30]  That Forrest's mother was talking about.  You're a no good son of a bitch.  Fuck you motherfucking.  We're so much fucking better than you.  Absolute lunacy.  If you're giving me the hook, fine, whatever.  I do what I'm told.  I'm completely out of control.  It doesn't get better than this.  Come on, it's shocking.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Whee!  Whee!  Whee!  Whee!  Ah, morning! 
[00:01:00]  Hi, everybody.  Hi, everybody.  I was just reading in the newspaper that Thursday is the angriest day of the week.  Is it?  That makes sense.  Why does that make sense?  Give me that paper.  Because I was angry.  Why were you angry today?  I got driving advice from a cab driver this morning.  He gave you advice?  Ah, dude.  Were you up on the sidewalk?  No.  It's, again, that stretch of road where I've got to make the lights or it's going to take 
[00:01:30]  me twice as long.  Yeah, it's a timing thing.  It's all about timing of the lights here in New York.  And so I get through one light and this cabbie won't go over like four miles an hour.  So I get around him and I goose it and I see the light up ahead and I see the, like the  don't walk thing starting to flash and I'm a good full block away.  So I'm just, like you just hear the escalator. 
[00:02:00]  Sure.  And then the light turns yellow and red.  Did you make the light?  No.  Did you go through the light?  Nope.  Wow.  Because it's right by Fox News and there's the cops there.  Oh, okay.  So that's the only light I can't really blow through.  How funny is that?  You know which lights you can't blow through.  Believe me, I've done this commute.  I can do it with my eyes closed.  I have sometimes.  And then, so now the cab driver that fucked me in the first place, because he was doing 
[00:02:30]  four miles an hour for the initial first part of the, between lights that was in front  of me before I could get around him.  Has caught up to you.  Now he's caught up to me.  Because you're stuck at the light.  I got you.  I wouldn't have been if it wasn't for him, first of all.  Why?  Oh, because you had to get around him.  Because I had to get around him.  And that was the, that was the difference between making the light.  Making the light and not making it.  Or sitting there at a red light.  His savage ass.  Uh oh.  So, so, oh, oh yeah, yeah.  Well, of course, he's, you know, some, some Middle Eastern gentleman. 
[00:03:00]  And, uh, he pulls up next to me and I see his window, the, the window go down.  And, and I see him lean his fucking head out.  And, and, and I roll my window down like, oh, here, here it comes.  What?  I go, what?  And he goes, it takes minutes to sit at a light.  It takes seconds to crash a car.  I'm like, really?  Well, I, really does it? 
[00:03:30]  Like, I didn't know what to say.  I wanted to be racist.  I wanted to.  You didn't know what to say.  I wanted to slam him.  I was just.  This was your opportunity.  But, but you know what?  You've been waiting for this.  It was, it's, I gotta get a new fucking line for him.  Because the whole savage thing and you, and you go blow something up thing and whatever.  Is it getting old?  Like, I'm constantly just telling them that they're terrorists and they blow things up  and, and I'm bored with it.  That's kind of hack to them.  It's hack now.  You think it's hack to them?  It's so hack to them.  They hear it all the time.  Yeah.  So I was just, I was so angry.  That's what gets me too. 
[00:04:00]  The people that fuck you over are the same people that'll look at you like,  see, we all have to sit at the light now.  That's like, no, I wouldn't have had to if it wasn't for you, dipshit.  Yeah, this all started with you.  Yeah, it was you.  You.  I like when you get around people and then, and then you get stuck and they come up behind  you or next to you and they give you a look like, well, I really made it far, didn't you?  It's like, yeah, because there's another asshole just like you in front of me. 
[00:04:30]  Just like you.  Oh, it's infuriating.  But it shouldn't be.  I mean.  I know.  It's like a ghost town when we come into the New York.  Exactly.  That's the point.  Like I understand there, there, when we leave, you shouldn't have to socialize with  anybody on your way into work because we're lucky that way.  Exactly.  There's maybe 10 cars on the road.  Yeah.  All in my way.  True.  All in my fucking way.  In the afternoon, it's a different story.  I understand.  I'm not going to be able to do fucking 60 down fucking third Avenue or something. 
[00:05:00]  You know, I, I understand this.  So I'm not crazy the whole time, but at this, this hour of the morning, it's wide open.  And get the fuck out of my way.  Look at your mirror.  If you see a monster truck coming up on your ass, move over and let me go through.  But they won't.  They don't.  Because they're fucking cab drivers.  I think you blew it, though.  What happened?  It was your opportunity.  Yeah, I know.  I feel.  Do a little something, something.  I didn't even have it in me.  I didn't have the, the, the passion, the racist passion to really go after this guy this morning. 
[00:05:30]  Maybe you're really not a racist.  Am I softening in my age?  Maybe you're not a racist.  Is that what's happening?  Maybe you just play one on the radio.  I don't know.  Are you a racist?  I don't even know.  Yes.  Are you racial or are you racist?  I know.  I never understand that.  I get mad when Patrice says that.  What's the difference?  It's racial.  It's not racist.  I'm like, well, what?  Oh, it's racist.  Okay. 
[00:06:00]  He called me out and said that I don't watch basketball anymore because it's gotten too,  you know.  I'll just say too black.  But he said it a different way.  Yeah.  And I went home thinking about that.  I'm like, I don't, that's not why I stopped watching basketball.  I don't really know why.  Yeah.  But that's not why we joke about the neck tattoos and stuff.  And maybe that had something to do with it.  Yeah.  You know, in the Larry Bird era, no one had neck tattoos. 
[00:06:30]  No neck tattoos of lipstick and fucking lightning bolts.  I don't know.  But I mean, with this LeBron James thing, I'm back in.  But whatever.  That's a story for another day.  So are you all right now?  Yeah.  Now I'm just, you know, even then I was just.  I'm trying to find the fucking story on why Thursday is the worst day of the week, which  you're proving right in front of my eyes.  With anger.  Something about, they did a Twitter survey.  Those are always good.  Oh, yeah.  That's got to be accurate.  Those are always good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Very scientific Twitter. 
[00:07:00]  Wait.  Do you do Foursquare?  What?  Do you do Foursquare?  Our old boss does Foursquare.  And a few other people do Foursquare.  What the fuck?  I don't really understand what it's about.  It seems like it's a waste of time.  It's kind of like a location service.  What?  Page three.  Page three of Daily News.  Maybe not your Daily News.  Thank you, Anthony.  They make different Daily Nooses.  Thank you, Anthony. 
[00:07:30]  My page three, which I've looked at ten times, Mars, does not have the story.  Mars, you're a bitch.  Oh, wait.  It does have the story.  Mars, you ain't a bitch.  Why can't you see shit this early in the morning?  I can't see, god damn it.  I went over this page a million times, and yeah, it's right there.  What's right there?  Right under the whale picture, which everybody will be checking out today.  You heard about the whale thing?  Yes, I was walking down the street. 
[00:08:00]  Some fucking whale jumps out of the water near Cape Town, South Africa, and just pretty  much destroys a fucking sailboat.  Comes down right on top of the boat?  Right on top of it.  Yeah, that fucking thing is just like, screw you.  And the picture is amazing, and some tourists snapped it from another boat, whale pretty  much out of the water, and then you get to see the aftermath picture.  Unfortunately, they didn't get the actual whale hitting the boat, but that's pretty damn 
[00:08:30]  good photography right there.  As close as you're going to get.  Pretty good, right?  Yeah.  Wow, that's frightening.  I would imagine it's going to be on TV and in every paper.  If not, we'll fucking tweet that for you.  That's a monster attacking you.  It's a monster attacking you.  There's no difference.  With these big barnacle-y things on its nose.  Yeah, whales aren't cute.  They've got big nasty barnacles on them.  The little stupid eye.  What did it think?  It was like, did they give a little theory on why it did it?  That involves reading. 
[00:09:00]  I've got to read.  Yeah.  I just look at the pictures.  Call me Squishmail.  Ishmael Squishmail.  Mail, yeah.  You know, can they just write a fucking story without a punny?  Call me Squishmail.  A pair of South African sailors got the fright of their lives when a massive whale leapt out of the water and crash-landed right on their ship.  I looked around and I saw this huge whale coming out of the water and smashing against the side of the boat. 
[00:09:30]  Said, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, near blah, blah, blah.  The whale slipped back into the water, but we saw the mast with all its rigging and everything flying towards us.  That was scary.  Rigging.  Rigging.  All right.  Sorry.  Sorry.  I heard that.  A Taurus on another ship snapped the amazing shot of the airborne whale just seconds before it hit the deck Sunday.  The massive marine mammal is a southern right whale, which can grow as long as 50 feet and weigh up to 100,000 pounds. 
[00:10:00]  What did the right whale do wrong, Lou?  Right.  There's a...  The right whale did it wrong.  We get it.  There's a...  There's a whale in the...  Just spit it out, you asshole.  There's a...  One of my favorite bits you ever did, brother.  Ah.  I forgot.  It was a fun one.  I think Brewer started that on the show. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then we took that one and made it a little different.  Fucking...  Do they have...  Well, they have southern right whales.  Do they have southern left whales or northern left whales?  There's a...  Who's on first?  The 32-foot sailboat, dubbed the Intrepid, suffered no structural damage, although its 
[00:11:00]  mass was shattered and its rigging destroyed.  There's a...  He was just having fun, Werner said.  The whale did not intend to attack us.  Oh, how do you know?  It's one of those big fucking...  He's lonely.  Yeah.  How do you know what the fucking whale's intent was?  Right.  Maybe he's finally fucking had it.  Yeah.  Maybe he's seen all his little friends getting harpooned and said, you know what?  I think I'm going to start attacking before they attack me.  And that isn't even like the biggest whale. 
[00:11:30]  What's the biggest one?  The blue whale?  I'm going to go blue whale.  The blue whale.  Are there any of those left?  Not many.  The blue whale.  He needed the money.  There's a...  That's all I want to do now.  The only blue whale I've ever seen or know of is that one that's hanging up in the Museum  of Natural History.  Did I see that?  Is that a giant fake one?  Is that a blue whale?  It's a plastic one that's just hanging up over the stairs.  I don't even know.  I haven't been to that museum in freaking...  That's a good museum to go to.  ...into cards. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  Oh, you know what?  Very good, Ant.  We're going back to your story.  Oh!  You kind of wimped out.  You had a chance to really...  No, I didn't.  ...really give a cabbie's...  ...you know, a piece of your mind and you fell.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Who's this?  Hello?  I'm Kerpal.  Yes.  All right.  Let's see where the bit goes, Opie.  Yes, Kerpal?  Oh, yes.  I am the cab driver Anthony was talking about.  Oh! 
[00:12:30]  That was you?  Yes, of course it was me.  I'm not lying or anything.  Okay.  Well, you...  Oh, what a cunt.  Yeah, really, man.  I would also like to remind him that a bird in the hand is also worth one in the bush.  Yeah, man.  I'm a bit nervous.  I'm sorry.  I'm driving a cab and I'm talking on the phone.  I have a fair right now.  We get it.  The guy comes up with a nice little bit for himself. 
[00:13:00]  His bit stinks.  He's getting ready to go to his miserable job and he can't go with his little bit.  Make him happy, yeah.  Thank you, cab driver.  Jesus.  Thank you.  Yeah, this is true.  Let's go to Bobby Bigrigger.  Bobby!  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Long time.  Hello.  What's up, Bobby?  Yeah, it has been a while.  Yeah, tell Jimmy I said happy birthday.  What'd you say?  Jimmy, by the way, hold on.  We only got to see half of it so far, unfortunately, but the piece he did for Leno last night is out 
[00:13:30]  fucking standing.  Yeah, funny shit.  Rave reviews coming in.  And then we saw half of it so far.  We had to start the show.  Our timing sucks.  But what we saw so far was hilarious.  It went to some kind of inventor's convention.  Yeah.  And the clip is online, I guess, NBC.com or something.  Is that where it is?  Yeah.  Somewhere.  But make sure you check it out today.  It's hilarious.  Tonight Show.  Jimmy hit a major home run last night for Leno.  Go ahead, Bobby.  We do.  Hey, Ant. 
[00:14:00]  Yes, sir.  You should have pulled a Mel Gibson on him.  Pull him his mother can get on her knees and blow me.  Blow me.  I missed a light because of you.  You can blow me.  Later, guys.  Later.  Yelling at the cab driver in the style of Mel Gibson.  Mm-hmm.  In the style.  A lot of people say, hey, Ope, you want me to run back to the diner to get another  placemat because, see, I couldn't find the Twitter story. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, that would have been on there.  Yeah.  Actually, you would have had to do a connect the dots for the whale.  True.  To draw the whale.  True.  And then color it in with some crayon.  I find those very hard to do sometimes.  Connect the dots?  Yes.  Yeah.  You've got to go from one to two.  And then sometimes you can't find three.  All that crap.  If you're going to do some kind of maze, how about you make it hard?  Yeah.  You can just zip right through it.  It's not only three-year-olds are enjoying your placemats.  Yeah.  You're putting them down in front of everybody.  Right.  Exactly.  Why should I have to suffer?  Make it a little harder. 
[00:15:00]  Jeff in Cleveland.  What's up, Jeff?  Hey, nothing much, guys.  You know, there's probably people sitting on a boat watching from a distance going,  oh, my gosh, it's so magical.  And then it just literally turns into a blood-curdling scream.  Yeah.  The majesty of the breaching whale just turns into, holy shit.  It gets me hard just thinking about it.  Catch you guys later.  All right.  Yeah, too bad there wasn't any death.  No death and destruction.  No death and destruction.  It is always good when the animals kind of win one, when you can chalk one up to the animal. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, so getting back to four square.  Four square.  Yeah.  Too bad Elo doesn't really do our show anymore.  But he does.  Yeah, he might soon.  From what I heard about Oprah's ratings, whoa.  What?  From what I heard about Oprah's ratings, hey, he might be back.  Who knows?  Nah, that's why Oprah hired him.  Yeah?  To get her into that new era.  I know.  The era after the TV show.  I just want him back. 
[00:16:00]  She knows she's ready.  No shit.  She knows, you know, it's time to move on.  So the whole Oprah brand becomes something else after next year.  Let me say hi to Jason in Kentucky.  Jason.  Hey, how you doing, boys?  All right.  Hello.  All right.  Hey, I've been wanting to get through a couple times.  First off, I was just listening to the Howard Stern show, and he seemed like he was getting  upset because of when Jay Leno introduced Jimmy onto the show last night. 
[00:16:30]  Jay Leno had said, here comes Jimmy coming from the biggest show on satellite radio, the  Opie and Anthony show, and it seemed like Howard was kind of upset about that.  Well, see.  They have a battle going on that's been raging for years.  But what I find hilarious, I'll take you inside that whole thing.  Well, Jay Leno is doing that on purpose to bother Howard, and it's working perfectly.  It is.  Howard should just ignore it.  Yeah.  Because it's just making Jay, like, skip around his fucking mansion out there in L.A. 
[00:17:00]  going, I got him.  Again.  He's playing right into his hands.  He does it just to make him mad.  It's very easy to get to Howard, though.  But, I mean, we're not going down that road today, but it's extremely fucking easy.  Really easy.  The other thing I wanted to bring up, sorry, guys.  He says, I did become a lifetime subscription member, though, to XM after Jimmy had gotten  me out of a speeding ticket a few weeks ago from his Boneyard show.  Jimmy was talking about something on the Boneyard show. 
[00:17:30]  The cop came up to the car, was getting ready to write me up a ticket, and was listening to  Jimmy and was laughing.  And he goes, I tell you what, if you're brave enough to listen to something like that, you  don't even deserve a ticket.  And after that, I became a lifetime subscription.  What a guy.  What a guy.  What happened?  What happened?  I was using your phone call to find something. 
[00:18:00]  Did you have fun with your phone call?  Did I have fun with my phone call?  Did you enjoy your phone call, sir?  We just want to make sure somebody had a good time with the phone call.  Sometimes you just got to do things for yourself.  I'll admit something else.  Sometimes I take a bad phone call so I could, like, set up something I want to do on the  show.  You were that person, sir.  Foursquare.  No, actually, thanks, Jason.  Foursquare.  So, I guess, let's say you're at, I don't know, let's say you're at a Starbucks on, I'm 
[00:18:30]  trying to think of a Starbucks in the area, whatever, no one's going to care, 57th and  5th Avenue.  Oh, right?  Make believe there's a Starbucks there.  So then you tweet through Foursquare.  Which corner?  The northwest corner.  Okay, let me get it in my head.  There is none.  Actually, that's a, like a...  It's Louis Vuitton.  Is it?  No, on 6th.  On 5th?  5th or 6th.  What'd you say?  57th and 6th? 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, I just went on 5th, but it's probably...  Actually, that's a Bergdorf Goodman.  No, I think there's a little cafe there.  Goodman!  Anyway, so you tweet from a location like a Starbucks, okay?  Yeah.  Any fucking Starbucks.  And you go, hey, I'm at this, I'm at Starbucks.  And through the GPS, whatever, on your phone.  Nice one.  Thank you.  All of a sudden, like, I don't really understand how this works. 
[00:19:30]  Could someone fucking call it?  Why don't you read it in the paper?  Mars, where is the story?  No, no, no.  I got the Twitter story, but this Foursquare...  So, I don't...  So, you collect places or something?  What?  Someone fucking explain Foursquare and tell me why it's cool.  What?  What?  What?  And then you win badges.  Why don't you collect places, you cunt?  And then you unlock badges and stuff.  Badges.  Yeah, and then...  I don't get it. 
[00:20:00]  And then it tells you everyone else that has been at that location in the Foursquare universe.  Foursquare.  Why do they call it Foursquare?  I don't know.  And obviously it's not popular because they can't get one fucking person on the phone to explain it.  They were going to call it Please Catch Me Cheating, but then they figured that they wouldn't get a lot of downloads that way.  Someone says over here, look, sweet spot, Foursquare sounds fucking gay.  I got to agree with you on that one.  Got to agree with you on that one.  But a lot of people are doing it, and I don't understand what's the big deal. 
[00:20:30]  And then if you're at an airport, you're like, hey, I'm at blah, blah airport.  And then it says, well, all these other people have been at that airport.  And what are you collecting, just the fact that you went to a place?  I don't know.  I guess the more places you go to that other people have been to, it unlocks badges, and there's a power struggle to see who the biggest faggot is.  I don't know.  Fucking glory hole.  Mongo the Trucker.  T-Boy.  Mongo.  Morning, guys.  What's up?  I can explain it, but I can't make it sound cool. 
[00:21:00]  That's good.  You prefaced that very well.  At least you're being honest.  You didn't throw yourself under the bus or truck for knowing what Foursquare is.  Please enlighten us, sir.  When you check into a place, you can post it on Twitter and Facebook or just on Foursquare itself.  And if you check into a place more than somebody else, you become the mayor of that place.  And I don't know what it gives you, but it's just this weird thing where you check in at more places, 
[00:21:30]  and you become the mayor of all these places, and you get badges for being 25 places and 50 places.  All right, look, Pat from Monaki just said it should be called For Queers.  F-O-R.  Yes.  That's how he spelled it.  W-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w.  I don't understand the reason behind it, but I do it a couple times a day, and I just don't know why. 
[00:22:00]  I don't understand it either.  It's just something stupid.  I have no desire to do it, but I follow Elo, and like CokeLogic points out, he's the mayor of a lot of stuff.  Elo is the mayor of stuff.  He plays all the time.  Why is he...  And then does he talk to Oprah about it?  I don't...  No, he hasn't been on Oprah since he went on without his pants on.  I mean, like, probably backstage.  Oh, probably, yeah.  Or in a boardroom.  Well, maybe we'll get lucky, because you can add places if something's not on the map. 
[00:22:30]  You can add your house and check in at your house every time.  So maybe we can look through all his places and find out where Oprah's house is.  Maybe he got lucky and added to it.  Oh, that's a...  Well, she has about 18 houses, I think, so...  But I still don't understand why it would be fun in the social networking world we live in.  Yeah.  Yeah, why is that fun?  I know some of the people I follow, and there's a link.  I'm like, oh, cool, a link.  Maybe to a video or a cool picture. 
[00:23:00]  And it's like, no, it's some kind of four-square fucking map link.  It goes nowhere.  It pisses me off.  It works for me, because if I check in at a truck stop, and it goes over my Facebook and Twitter,  Manga the Trucker on Twitter, by the way,  if somebody's close by, they can see that I'm there and swing in and have a cup of coffee or whatever.  So I don't like people knowing where I am.  I don't like having...  I like having a phone, not a tracking fucking device. 
[00:23:30]  Unless you're looking to get blown by strangers, why would you want people to know where you are?  Yeah.  Well, everybody needs a hobby, don't they?  Yeah, that's true, too.  All right.  Thank you, Mongo.  Further explanation coming in from Oscar in Ohio.  Oscar?  Oscar.  Ah, fuck, he just took my thunder away.  Oh, he did?  Okay.  Can I add to that, though?  It wasn't quite thunder.  Slow down.  It was a water spout.  It's about fucking four square. 
[00:24:00]  It wasn't this big thunderous thing.  Stupid...  Hold on one second.  The stupid news here in New York, I fucking love pointing out how ridiculous they are on a daily basis.  They're making a big deal about a water spout that somebody saw in the water yesterday during some heavy storm activity.  Heavy, heavy thunderstorms, hail, and high winds yesterday buffeted parts of Long Island, and we believe there was a water spout in the sound. 
[00:24:30]  I go to hell.  What does that mean in the end?  Who gives a shit?  It happens.  Did it do anything?  You ever see shit?  You ever see when, like, garbage and newspapers twirl around in a little tornado-y thing in a parking lot?  Put that over the water, and it's going to be a water spout.  Okay, exactly.  That's what I thought.  That's pretty much it, and it's not going to be one of these giant ones like you see in Florida up here.  We just don't get them.  Nah, we don't get shit.  I want to get an awesome hurricane this year.  Yeah, we ought to get a good hurricane.  I really want to see a really good hurricane. 
[00:25:00]  Oscar, so you can't add to the four square info?  No, it's just exactly like Mongo explained it, man.  It's pretty fucking gay, though.  Man, all right.  And Elo really sucks.  Why?  Yeah.  Because I'm thinking, well, he's usually on top of the latest technology.  Something, well, maybe I should look into this four square thing.  No.  Sounds like there's no reason to.  There's no, it doesn't sound fun or any reason.  I noticed I'm very paranoid about the, well, I could just end it there. 
[00:25:30]  Very paranoid.  All right, let's move on to the next phone call.  I'm very paranoid about when the iPhone asks me if I want the app to know my location,  and I instantly hit no, and then realize it was for the weather.  Oh, really?  Like, so it's like, okay, it's kind of got to know what the fuck, you know?  Yeah, it's got to know where you are to give you the latest weather.  Yeah, yeah.  And then something else is a little wacky. 
[00:26:00]  Google Earth upgraded.  Upgraded a few things.  I noticed last night.  I went, and I went, oh.  Oh, really?  They got a new picture of your house?  Look at it, it's brand new, brandy new, and I'm like, ah, interesting.  And I'm also thinking, there's a car in my driveway.  It's not my car.  I, and this has been within the past couple of weeks that this picture's upgraded. 
[00:26:30]  I mean, it's brand fucking new.  Slow down a little bit, because I remember the old picture of your house had a car in it.  Yeah, that was Melinda's.  All right, we knew it was the ex's car.  Yeah, yeah.  Which is fine, you know, whatever.  And that's when you knew, okay, this picture hasn't been updated in a while, because that's  still her car, and I don't have the pool in the backyard and all that crap.  But now you're trying to tell me there's a new picture where it's an updated picture.  There it is.  Now, look, it's got the backyard with the pool, and now there's a white car parked next to 
[00:27:00]  my Escalade.  Okay.  And this picture's been taken within the past three, I think it was just before Keith's  party.  Okay.  This picture was taken.  I'm thinking to myself, now, for me, I'm fine.  I don't care.  I'm, you know, I'm a single successful guy.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, if you're fucking around, and your wife knows whose fucking car that is, and looks 
[00:27:30]  at Google Maps, now for the next, I don't know how long, there's information about somebody's  car being in your fucking...  Oh, I see what you're saying.  Like, you could get fucked by this moment in time that is snapped.  And all it takes is the wife or whoever to...  Going to Google Maps and going, that's...  Google Maps one time in the next six months to a year to see, wait a minute, whose fucking  car is that?  That's so-and-so's car.  That's funny.  And, like, if she knows, like, that is this chick's car or something. 
[00:28:00]  Right.  That you know...  Gotcha.  And now it's at the house.  How is that legal?  I don't know.  I was just thinking, that's creepy.  And then look at my fucking lounge chairs in the back.  That very easily could have been naked girl in the lounge chair picture.  Right.  And the problem is what?  That it isn't.  Because that's funny.  And then I was told that there is a site that is, like, Google Earth fuck-ups or things.  Uh-huh.  Where they have got naked people and...  Oh, right on.  And people that have, like, breaking into houses. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, really?  And shit like that.  Like, it's just a whole bunch of fucked-up shit.  Do you know whose white car that is?  No, I actually don't.  Offhand, I'm not really sure whose fucking car that is.  That's classic.  I'm trying to think.  I think I might have an idea, but I'm not sure.  Are you going to jot something down there?  Yeah.  Let me say hi to Doug in Texas.  Doug?  Yeah, hey, what's up?  Hey.  Yeah, so I have some information about Foursquare.  I saw this online.  There's a site called pleaserobme.com. 
[00:29:00]  I think it's something like pleaserobme.  Please robme.  Please robme.com.  Yeah.  Okay.  Because this Foursquare thing, you know, people know where you are.  They know exactly when you're not at your house.  You're telling them when you're not at your house.  Yeah.  And I think, yeah, one of you brought up some concerns about that.  Well, that's true.  I'm just looking at this Google Top Ten Moments caught on Google Map, Street View. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  Have you ever seen the LARPers on Street View?  It's LARPers.  Yeah, it's really funny, actually.  I'll try and find it.  Can you know what's the place?  Huh?  Can you tell what they're playing?  Can you tell what they're playing?  They're being homos in the street.  They're playing I'm a homo.  Yeah, they're playing make-believe.  Best Street View.  Top Ten.  Top Fifteen.  I've also seen, like, a house fire.  Isn't that fucked up?  Top Fifteen Google Street View sightings. 
[00:30:00]  Right on.  Yeah.  Now, this is a website I could check out.  Hey, Doug, thank you.  Yeah, it's Foursquare means please rob me.  Yeah.  Right on.  All right, brother.  There's actually a site called please rob me.  Yeah, we're going to check that out as well.  Those hot babes.  Thank you.  Hot babes.  Adult bookstore.  There's a guy walking into the adult bookstore.  Yeah, that's a strip club.  A strip club.  Yeah, that's a guy that looks like he's breaking into a place.  Yeah, this isn't the one that I had seen.  I'll have to find it. 
[00:30:30]  All right.  And check it out please rob me, too.  So I guess we're not learning much about Foursquare.  No.  Let me go to Roach.  Roach, what's up?  Oh, there's the LARPing picture?  That's classic.  It's just two guys.  It looks ridiculous.  One guy's wielding his sword.  Captured in time, forever and ever.  Hey, Roach, what do you got, brother?  The best thing about that please rob me.com site is it offers real-time search results. 
[00:31:00]  So you can just see, like, you know, so-and-so is at, like, a Chili's somewhere.  And you can call the Chili's up and prank call them.  And it really puts people off their guard when you're prank calling them away from their house.  Wow, what a fucking weird site.  Please rob me.com.  Could you go to please rob me.com?  That's it right there?  No, no, no.  There's, like, a hundred results.  That street view of a cat.  Oh, what the fuck is that?  Hold on, brother.  We got a couple different things going on right now, which is fine. 
[00:31:30]  This is a Google map.  That's a street view of some black guy.  And what is he, pointing a gun at another guy?  I mean, in all...  Well, I guess not in all actuality.  It's probably a toy, but...  Really?  Who knows?  Well, they look like...  I mean, could be.  It's a very small child.  We drove by it.  I don't know.  We drove by a shooting down there in Washington.  Remember that morning, Ed?  Oh, yeah.  And then the person from XM that was, you know, getting us from the hotel to the facility 
[00:32:00]  decided that she needed to slow down and stop and check it out.  Yeah, yeah.  Why not?  I'm like, are you kidding me?  The police were behind their car doors with their fucking guns drawn.  Yeah, guns out.  And she wanted to slow down and check it out.  I'm like, no, that's okay.  Let's keep going.  Roach, go ahead.  So, please rob me dot com.  Yeah, it offers real-time results of where people are.  So, like, you know, you see somebody check into a hotel at Hilton, and you can call the 
[00:32:30]  front desk, and you can go to their Twitter account, get the real name, ask for their  room, and then you can prank call them in their hotel room or something.  And no one's expecting to get prank called in their hotel room.  Showing your prank call.  Yeah, but this is something we really haven't talked about on the show with all this social  networking.  It's got to be real easy to fucking rob people.  Well, you're knowing where people are a lot more.  Or you talk.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to step over you, but I was just saying, it's fun to fuck with people. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah, that website isn't operating at the moment.  No.  Go to pleasestepalloverthehost.com.  Let's see who turns up.  I think it'll be fucking Roach.  All right, Roach.  Thank you.  Please don't shoot me dot com.  Oh!  Whoa!  Y'all!  And then he giggles.  Look at him bringing it around.  All right.  So this started with the Twitter thing.  Looks like you got a case of the Thursdays.  Oh, it looks like we got a case of the Thursdays. 
[00:33:30]  If you're in a bad mood today, you're not alone.  A study tracking the moods of Twitter users has revealed that people are angrier on Thursdays  than any other day of the week.  We're not really sure exactly why Thursday, but people's bad moods build from Monday until  then.  Friday, obviously, no one's in a bad mood.  You're blowing off steam.  It's Friday.  So you've had the whole week to just go, er, it's not the weekend yet.  It's only Thursday.  I get it.  But why aren't you in a bad mood on Monday?  Thursday...  Monday, you just resign yourself to the fact that you're just tired. 
[00:34:00]  You're fucking...  You could be, like, annoyed.  I think Monday, you're just annoyed.  But Thursday starts the weekend for a lot of people.  Yeah?  Yes!  I thought it was Wednesday.  Wednesday?  Yeah, you got to jump on everybody.  Did you have a good Wednesday?  No, I really didn't.  I sat in the house.  I got to say, I went and saw Colin Quinn's one-man show last night.  Holy shit, is it good.  Colin is a funny motherfucker. 
[00:34:30]  Basically, it's 75 minutes, and it's the history of the entire world, starting from the caveman  to right now.  That's the gist of his show.  Yes.  And he does such a fucking great job.  Really clever and really funny.  He's very insightful, Colin.  He's got a way of looking at shit and conveying it in that inimitable Colin style.  Yeah, he got huge laughs and a standing ovation at the end.  Tiny little theater on Bleecker Street. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, I got to see that.  You definitely got to see it.  I don't know how long it's running.  Maybe Steve or somebody could tell me.  I think it's only running for another six weeks or so.  I don't know.  Not really sure.  I forgot the name of the show.  So I'm trying to give him a good plug.  Sorry, Carl.  I know he's IamColinQuinn on Twitter, so I'm sure he's tweeting when the shows are happening.  But it's 45 Bleecker Street here in Manhattan.  So if you find yourself in New York City in the next few weeks, man, definitely think about 
[00:35:30]  going to see it.  Really, really good.  Check it out.  Really good.  Just him, a fucking chair, a little table.  Oh, yeah?  Sips a little tea in between his little scenes.  Really?  Yeah, because he's jumping through history.  He has some fade-outs because he's got a little screen behind him with maps of the world and such.  Oh, really?  He's got a little multimedia experience?  A little bit, a little bit.  So a little screen and some lighting changes?  A little bit.  Yeah?  Some fade-outs and then he walks over, takes a sip of tea, and then he turns back around  and he's ready for the next part of his little one-man show. 
[00:36:00]  Mesopotamia.  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  He talks about the Greeks and the Romans and the Russians.  Actually, he even went after Islam.  Islam.  He did.  Yes, he did.  One of the brave few.  Yes, he had some jokes about Islam.  Islam.  Because he went after the Catholics.  Yeah.  And the priests.  He's a Catholic, isn't he?  Yeah, he is.  He was going to raise a Catholic.  Really, really good.  And I could see where they put a little more production behind it. 
[00:36:30]  It so could be on TV as like a special or something.  Yeah.  Easily.  Well, if it's Colin, if it got on TV, it would fail miserably.  Oh, don't say that.  Oh, my God.  I'm not saying that.  Of course.  I'm one of Colin's biggest fans.  Colin's one-man show goes to August 15th.  And then last night, I had to curse out somebody on Twitter.  No.  No.  And then I got fucking bitch slapped. 
[00:37:00]  What?  I got...  What, what?  I got bitch slapped.  That's all I do now is the Mel Gibson what, what.  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  I wasn't prepared for this.  But basically, I said I saw Colin Quinn.  And then I wrote 45 Bleeker in my tweet.  You know, I praised Colin.  I said 45 Bleeker.  And then someone writes, there's a C in Bleeker.  Oh, we've been through that before online.  With who?  I mean, on the show.  Really?  Yeah.  Online. 
[00:37:30]  On the show.  We've been through that before.  Somebody did it and we were yelling at them for spelling it wrong.  And then we realized that it wasn't.  That they were right.  I wasn't in the mood to be corrected.  So...  Corrected.  I had a pretty good tweet about it.  And I can't find any of these fucking tweets now.  Aw, shit.  Aw, shit.  Uh...  Alright, hold on.  I might...  Uh...  Wow.  I had a lot of fucking tweets last night.  Did you?  No.  People tweeting me.  So I can't find it.  Sandy Cain, by the way, is in the news. 
[00:38:00]  What's she do now?  She's...  For the naked cowgirl thing again?  Yeah, she's officially being sued.  Uh, really?  She didn't give up?  We...  Well, we...  She said she was sticking to her guns.  Alright, here it is, Ant.  So...  Oh.  That's...  Nice spilling of the coffee.  At least the newspaper got a lot of it.  And my fucking...  And your cock.  And my cock.  Now it looks like you fucking pissed yourself.  I know, great.  Ha!  There's nothing worse than spilling something on your dick.  It's like I got old man dribble.  That's great. 
[00:38:30]  So the guy, uh...  The guy writes, uh...  Bleeker.  It has a C.  So I write,  Is that a C as in you're a cunt for pointing it out?  Oh, shit.  Alright.  See, you jumped right on him is what you did.  I sure did, Anthony.  Yeah.  I sure did.  And then he wrote...  And this is the...  This is what makes it pretty classic.  Hold on.  I'm trying to clean up coffee.  Why did I fucking slow down this stupid show? 
[00:39:00]  Nope.  He writes,  He writes,  Nope, I'm a cunt for pointing out that your,  Y-O-U-R,  should be  Y-O-U apostrophe R-E.  Oh, no.  So my great slam back at this fucker.  I got you with the your, your.  I fucked up that.  The your, your is a big thing on Twitter.  I know that one, though.  That's a big thing.  It's like Internet 101.  Yes.  You cannot misspell...  You need to know the proper way to use your, 
[00:39:30]  you have to also know the proper way to use two.  If you're slamming somebody,  you better...  You gotta make sure you're...  The grammar has to be right,  the spelling,  the punctuation,  everything has to be perfect,  or you are then the asshole.  Well, then I was gonna make some kind of excuse that,  you know,  you only have 140 characters,  so I was fucking,  you know,  combining shit.  Yeah.  But then I realized,  as I was heating up from embarrassment,  I'm like,  oh my God,  I've so lost this one,  so I had to just openly admit on my Twitter, 
[00:40:00]  all right,  I lose on this one.  I fucked up.  And then I wrote some like,  we'll meet again.  I'll get you.  I'll get you in some future tweet.  That was worth fucking slowing down  the entire rhythm of a fucking radio show.  Or how to find the damn thing.  Just yapping.  All right,  and why don't we take our first break?  That's what we should do.  I got a sandwich.  Yeah,  we're gonna do the Brewer bit.  Thank you,  E-Rock.  Remember the...  Oh,  yeah,  yeah.  That was a good one,  the,  um,  goof on,  like Abbott and Costello. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah,  with Brewer.  It was fun.  Let's do this.  Oh my...  Hey,  I'm bad!  I'm bad!  I'm bad!  What did you see,  Lou?  Hey!  Hey!  Lou,  you're delirious.  What did you see,  Lou?  Yeah,  you saw a light in the sky,  Lou?  Hey,  I'm bad!  Hey,  I'm bad!  Hey,  I'm bad!  Now, I've taken a look, Lou, and there's nothing there. 
[00:41:00]  I'm just telling you, I've been on your level.  They just got it.  There's no such thing as flying saucers, Lou.  Now, go to bed so Dracula can come out of the wall behind you. 
[00:41:30]  Ridiculous.  But I'm just saying, Abbott!  Came in, Abbott!  You can't be acting like there's Lou, we're in the army.  Abbott!  They're always doing something wacky.  We're in the navy, Lou. 
[00:42:00]  I forgot all about that.  When the Japs would come in.  I love that old war propaganda.  We're going to kill us some Japs, Lou.  And some stereotypical big buck-toothed Jap would come up behind him.  Hey, Abbott!  It comes a Jap!  Come on!  We're 15 miles behind enemy lines.  There's no Japs here, Lou.  And there's the Jap with the baby.  But then...  Stop pulling that gun, Lou. 
[00:42:30]  There's nothing around here for miles.  There's the Jap right behind him.  But he keeps ducking when Abbott turns around.  You've got to see the visual of this.  Dude, that's got to be on TV, man.  Oh, my stomach hurts.  That's hilarious.  Ant, you make me sweat.  There is no Frankenstein, Lou. 
[00:43:00]  They put all the monsters all together.  Frankenstein, the werewolf, and Dracula with Abbott and Costello.  There is no whooping monkey.  Not bad!  I'm whoop!  I'm whoop!  I'm whoop!  I'm whoop!  Now, take this candle, which barely puts off a flame, with your nightgown, and go to bed.  I could listen to this all day.  Oh, God damn.  I love that. 
[00:43:30]  Holy crap.  Wow, that's funny.  Speaking of mummy, what's that behind you?  We've been digging here in Egypt all day.  Now, put the mummy on the truck.  Put the mummy on the truck, Louie.  The blue cup, Abbott!  Well, Lou, we've made it to Mars. 
[00:44:00]  Get out of the spaceship.  There's breathable air here.  And there aren't any Martians.  Holy...  I'm on!  Antennas!  No such thing as little green men, Lou.  Big eyes!  Eyes!  I'm gonna lose my mind up in here. 
[00:44:30]  Yo, Jim be raging, yo.  Can't kill that nigga over greed.  Do monster.  Oh, my God damn, dude.  That's just brilliant.  That's some funny stuff there, bro.  Well, here's the problem.  It's the you-know-what, and we ain't getting into that, are we? 
[00:45:00]  There's one behind you now, Lou.  Abbott!  A-nuh, a-nuh, a-nuh.  A big...  A-nuh, a-nuh, a-nuh.  There's a whole lot of...  Lou Lossny, Abbott.  They ain't around for miles, Lou.  We're in Beverly Hills.  I'm a... 
[00:45:30]  I'm a Jamaican!  The O.B. and Anthony Show is now, is now back on the Virus Sirius XM.  Steve, what's the Colin Quinn one-man show called?  I was trying to give it a plug, and I fucked it all up.  The show was great last night, but...  What was it?  Long story short.  Long story short, and what's the name of the theater?  I know it's 45 Bleecker Street, and it goes until August 15th. 
[00:46:00]  I'm telling you, you should see Colin Quinn's one-man show.  Hopefully, after August 15th, they do something else with it.  Maybe they move it to another city.  Maybe they make it a bigger production.  Maybe some TV isn't interested in it, because it's very clever and very funny.  G.H., it's called the Bleecker Street Theater.  45 Bleecker Street between Lafayette and Mott Street.  Oh, in New York City.  You know, I went up to the will-call window to get my tickets, and they go, are you here 
[00:46:30]  for the Colin Quinn one-man show, or the penis puppet guys?  They're in the same fucking place.  Remember those guys?  Puppetry of the penis?  Thank you, yeah.  Puppetry of the penis was also playing.  And I'm like, no, I'm here to see Colin Quinn.  Jeez.  But puppet, they're still at it.  They're still pulling their cocks, huh?  We met those guys probably close to 10 years ago.  And we thought, oh, this is just a stupid-  Like a quick gag?  Yeah, something maybe fraternity guys would do. 
[00:47:00]  Quick gimmick?  Because they're bored.  But 10 years later, they're still doing it.  And supposedly, they're doing it in many, many cities now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Puppetry of the penis?  Yeah, they franchised it out, right?  I guess.  Selena Gomez is 18 today.  Happy birthday.  She's 18.  And people are getting confused.  Yeah.  Because I know what you're about to say.  Yeah, yeah.  They're very confused.  I was listening to the Ron and Fez show, which is on at 11 o'clock AM on this very channel,  after us.  And some idiot called during the Ichiban segment, which is the top news stories. 
[00:47:30]  Uh, and, and said, oh, I got an Ichiban, uh, Anthony has a new girl.  It's Selena Gomez.  He was, like, drooling over her or something.  Like, I don't even know what this guy said, but all I had done is Jimmy Norton was here,  and he had commented that he had, uh, just gotten a picture taken with Selena Gomez, who  was in the building.  So I was like, oh, pop, pop, let me see the picture. 
[00:48:00]  And it's like, wow, she's cute.  Yeah.  Nothing.  I wasn't fucking doing the usual me drooling over a fucking picture or anything.  I'm not really into Selena Gomez.  I'm the one.  I'm not into it.  I'm the one that is.  Opie is.  Wizards of Waverly Place.  And, and it's just typical.  I even watch her show.  Oh.  It's a fine little show.  They kind of have.  Spank material?  They kind of have a little Harry Potter thing going.  Oh, do they?  A little bit.  But more in a sitcom form.  Ah.  You know? 
[00:48:30]  With little fucking, uh.  Uh, yeah.  Kenny's also a fan of Selena Gomez.  Oh, no.  This is unrelated, kind of.  Oh, okay.  I was also listening to Ron and Fez yesterday.  Yes.  That's the good news.  The bad news is, they were talking about Fez rubbing his asshole on Mr. Huge's microphone.  Mr. Huge's?  Who's that?  And why is he doing this?  I don't know.  I brought it to somebody's attention, and they, like, listened back and said I was mistaken, 
[00:49:00]  but I don't know.  All right.  Did he or did he not?  I don't know.  I'm concerned.  I'm concerned, G.H.  You have the audio, Mr. Huge?  The Rock has the audio.  Oh, he does.  Um, Philly, in Illinois, you're on my face.  Hey, Fezzy, would you rub the phone for me and give me good luck for the lottery tonight?  I really need it.  Fezzy, why don't you do this?  Pull your pants down and rub that lucky ass right on the phone. 
[00:49:30]  I can do that.  Rub the lucky ass over there.  That's it.  Get the lucky ass out on there.  There you go.  All right.  He just rubbed, he's rubbing his ass with the mic.  Opie uses that.  Opie uses that same mic.  You're disgusting, Fez.  So Selena Gomez is 18 years old today, Anthony, and I'm a big fan.  Big, big fan. 
[00:50:00]  I'm not a fan.  She's not white enough for you.  A little ethnic look to her.  A little Hispanic look to her.  A little Mexican.  A little Mexican.  Whatever it is.  I don't want to hear her song, E-Rock.  Stop talking to me.  Sorry.  How is E-Rock having a little chit-chat?  Yes, I'm talking to Anthony.  A little chit-chat with you.  Also, I don't know where he goes.  Why would I want to hear Selena Gomez's song?  Yeah, because I'm a fan of her music.  I'm a fan of her hot ass. 
[00:50:30]  You said Selena Gomez.  Yeah.  True that.  You did.  True that.  No, I'm not into her.  It's not like...  I mean, she's cute.  I'll give her that.  That's for sure.  But it's not like that.  Like, wow.  Not the Anthony fucking freak out perv switch.  Which, by the way, almost went off this morning.  Why?  Dude, I came so fucking close.  To just grabbing at somebody.  There was a girl crossing the street in a little sundress, and just, she looked great. 
[00:51:00]  And she's crossing the crosswalk in front of me, and then she gets on the sidewalk, and  the only thing, it popped right into my head, was like, I could lift the back of that sundress  up, and if she's even wearing panties, like, pull them real quick, like, up, pull the panties  down, and shove my tongue in her ass.  Wow.  It's like, I could probably, and then probably just, like, you know, run away.  What would the consequences be, you think? 
[00:51:30]  Ah, prison.  Prison?  Yeah.  That's not fair.  But that kept me from doing it.  That really isn't...  Prison's the only deterrent from all these fake fucking...  You think these are fake?  Of course they're fake.  Oh, well, maybe not.  I don't know.  Some of them look kind of real.  They're pulling girls, like, panties down, uh, skirts down and tops.  They just walk up.  I don't know.  This seems a little too fucking sexual assault-ish.  And the woman doesn't notice the camera nearby before this goes down? 
[00:52:00]  I bet you a lot of them are real.  You think?  Now that I think about it, yeah.  They're all, like, hot, though.  Well, you're not going to pull down the tube top of an old broad, are you?  Although that would be funnier.  That would kind of be funny.  Where can they see this, Dan?  Um, I don't know.  Hang on.  Let's see what I search for.  Have you just put sharking into Google?  Oh, it's sharking, right, yeah.  That's the second link.  It's a live link link.  Live link, okay.  Live sharking.  We learn about sharking today. 
[00:52:30]  I think the only thing that, like, keeps you from doing that is, uh, prison.  Right.  But who started that?  Because the cavemen, they were able to do all that stuff.  Yeah, but then, you know, things like chivalry.  You think cavemen ever scolded another caveman for doing some of that shit?  I bet they did.  Really?  Yeah.  I bet, like, if one caveman liked another cavewoman, uh, and another caveman was ready to, you know,  give her some caveman cock.  Uh, slip her the old caveman cock.  Uh, I bet, I bet they got mad. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  So, it's always been in place, I guess.  It's always been there.  The jealousy thing.  And then he caves his head in with a rock.  Because there's no, uh, no, uh, uh, what am I looking for?  Consequences.  Sure.  There's no consequences.  There's no society yet.  Oh, so you were just able to do whatever the fuck you want.  We're really distracted by this sharking thing.  Asian sharking?  Oh, Jesus.  What, are they pulling up fucking skirts to look at frying pan asses?  Boy, is that a genetic problem? 
[00:53:30]  Anyways, happy birthday to Selena Gomez.  18 years old.  18.  She hangs out here at SiriusXM a lot.  She's been here three or four times already.  Yeah, yeah.  I saw her when I was going to the elevator one day.  She was standing out there with a bunch of little kids taking pictures with her and stuff.  She is going to be beyond huge.  Yeah?  She's already huge with her audience, the tweens.  Is she the new Miley Cyrus?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's going to be bigger than Miley Cyrus.  Really?  Yes.  Miley's giant. 
[00:54:00]  Nah.  This Selena Gomez, you watch it.  A couple years, someone call me and say you were right.  She's going to go.  Dude, I don't know.  Miley Cyrus, pretty big.  She's going to seg into mainstream success, this Selena Gomez.  You think?  Oh, yeah.  I hope she ends up just to fuck it.  You're not a fan of that, really?  Nah, I'm a fan of that.  I know.  All right, good.  But then Ronnie was chastising me a little bit.  He goes, punch up a picture of her.  Punch up a picture of Selena Gomez.  And then they punch it up and he just goes, oh, Anthony.  Oh, oh, Anthony. 
[00:54:30]  He goes, Anthony's going to get us all in trouble here.  Oh, Anthony.  Well, I mean, the pictures online are when she was 15, 16.  I mean, you know, she just turned 18, so there's not many pictures of her at 18.  She's 18 today.  There's not many legal pictures of her.  Although 17 is the legal age of consent in New York.  You looked it up?  Oh, yeah.  You had to, right?  Yep.  You needed that info?  Yeah, but you can't show them porno. 
[00:55:00]  Or take pictures of them.  Or get them drunk.  Or get them drunk.  Right, right.  That's illegal.  They're drinking, but you don't know about it.  No, never.  I make sure that never fucking happens.  I'm not saying with you.  I know.  Anthony, the naked cowboy is a real cocksucker.  Oh, you want to keep this all sexy this break?  I sure do.  And he is officially suing our friend, Sandy Kane, who, of course, is the naked cowgirl.  Our friend?  Yeah, she's a friend.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on. 
[00:55:30]  So you smash your friend's guitar as often?  You know what's weird about that?  I did the right thing, and I gave her money.  I don't want to, like, you know.  I like how you say you did the right thing after smashing her guitar.  But I did the right thing in the end.  I hate tearing down walls here, but.  The end justifies the means.  After the show ended, I'm like, wow, that was fucking awesome for me.  So here's some money.  Get yourself a new guitar.  Yeah.  And last time she was in here, she's still playing the guitar that I smashed on the fucking cement.  It's taped together with bumper stickers and crap. 
[00:56:00]  Now I feel like an asshole, because I thought she'd come in here with a real nice guitar.  It would actually be an upgrade for her.  I shouldn't, because the one that you broke was a piece of shit, and for the money that she got for it, she could have got a really nice guitar.  Or at least one that was way better than the one that she had.  Way better than the one she had and had money left over.  So it's her own fault for just not going and using the money for what it was intended for.  Do you think she was going to do it, though?  I don't feel bad now.  You shouldn't.  Honestly, you know Sandy Kane enough that we couldn't hand her over that much money and then have her actually spend it on a guitar. 
[00:56:30]  Look at her life, what it's been.  She was going to fucking just use it for other shit.  But the guitar is how she makes her money.  Yeah, but she still has it.  You think if I smash her guitar, she'll go get one that's a little better, and she'll still have money left over.  Well.  I did the right thing.  Let me go to Chris in WI, wherever the fuck that is.  Wisconsin, I guess.  Wisconsin.  Chris, what do you got?  She was on, Selena Gomez was on David Letterman, and she was talking about her birthday, and his perv switch was going up and down, and he didn't know what to do with himself. 
[00:57:00]  Really?  He was like, oh, but look at you.  Oh, my.  It was really funny.  If they can find the video of that, he just was beside himself with that.  Oh, no.  A listener suggestion.  You know what, Danny?  I know what you're thinking, but let's go with the listener suggestion today. 
[00:57:30]  No.  Let's go with the listener suggestion.  No.  Chris in Wisconsin, let's do this.  These never work.  We have to find the video of Letterman oogling.  Oogling.  Let's use the word oogle today.  Or is it oogling?  I say oogling.  I think it's oogling.  I think it's oogle.  I think it's oogle.  Letterman oogle.  Letterman oogle Selena Gomez.  Oh, is this it?  All right.  Hold on.  Chris, stay in the line for your beating.  For your beating.  It opens July 23rd.  Please welcome the lovely Selena Gomez. 
[00:58:00]  Oogling to the end.  Oh, good God.  It's coming out with a little, a little top.  Crosses those legs.  Very nice to meet you.  I know, I know, I know, I know you're a kid.  I know, I know how old you are.  I'm not going to say how old you are.  You can say how old I am.  You said 17, right?  Yes.  Yeah, but you don't, you don't look 17.  Oh.  You look much, much, much, well, no, it's not bad, but it's just, it's just, I, I, I don't 
[00:58:30]  know.  Wow.  Because here, I'll show you, here, here's what I'm talking about right here.  Here, look at this picture right there.  You see that?  This is, uh, taken earlier today at Hooters.  Jesus.  And there you are right there.  Now, you see, when I see this and then you come out like that, I, I, I'm momentarily  stunned.  Oh.  It's, it's all right.  It's, it's me, it's not you.  Okay.  But you.  I like Hooters. 
[00:59:00]  Well, that's not really the issue.  Now, what were you doing in Hooters earlier today?  Uh, I was getting fried pickles and some curly fries.  I've never, never had a fried pickle, never heard of a fried pickle.  Really?  No.  I'm from Texas.  We fry everything.  Yeah.  Dave is a little flustered.  At the Texas State Fair, they even have a thing where you can get, get and eat fried  butter.  You can do fried butter, fried Oreos, fried Twix, fried Twinkies. 
[00:59:30]  Fried penis.  And never having had any of it, is it unbelievably tasty?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Don't have it.  Don't, don't have it.  It's too, too tasty.  Well, uh, then tell us about yourself.  You're from Texas.  So where in Texas?  She is, um.  Chris, all right.  No, you get a pass.  Yeah, you get a pass.  Because right, right off the bat, he was, he was a little.  He was humming.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And Kenny's a tattletale.  What?  Why? 
[01:00:00]  Because that was a funny bit yesterday.  That was fine.  I mean, there was nothing there.  I know.  I don't know why Kenny had to bring it to our attention.  Kenny had to run in and, oh, GH.  Like, you're right, Chris.

[01:17:00]  but but you know if the case walks into most people's offices they're going to realize that sandy i i don't  know sandy so sandy don't be offended by this pal but i'm doubting whether sandy has has uh much money  that this guy's ever going to recover from now can he enjoy her meaning stop her legally for  can he enjoy her from stopping this uh you know her her being the singing cowgirl or whatever she's  doing uh yeah he could do that he could get an order he could get an order restraining now how  how is a restraining order would how would that actually be enforced by filing a motion to have 
[01:17:30]  her held contempt for violating it and then the judge could lock her up actually lock her up for  dressing like a freak in times square and and playing a guitar that seems a little harsh the  judge the judge would look at it like she disobeyed first they'd bring her in then the judge would  order to cease and desist if she didn't cease and desist they'd be looking at it as contempt of  court for failing to obey court order that's how it would go wow so it would be a contempt charge  that happening i don't see that happening no i don't see that happening and a volunteer lawyer 
[01:18:00]  i mean a volunteer lawyer is just strictly a lawyer who's you know the guy might be a highly competent  guy i have no idea but he's just he's just not getting paid now the case has some publicity value  you know so so right to get your name in the paper if you're interested in getting on television  on the radio it's a case you pick up and you know and as far as sandy's uh downside and sandy doesn't  really have a big downside here i mean the bottom line is if there's an order if the judge gets gets  rough on it tells you this you know shut up sit down stop doing this the guy the guy can't legally  have you restrained i'm sure she'll do it because i'm sure sandy doesn't want to get locked up do you 
[01:18:30]  sandy um well it um me and lindsey lohan okay um i don't think exactly exactly exactly are you  were you talking one end of the spectrum and the other end of the spectrum  before and after yeah before and after  if lohan's lucky to make it to old age like yourself what you're like lindsey low tits  shut up they're terrible sandy sandy how is this thing working out for you still out there every

[01:20:00]  years after i spent thousands of dollars of um you know on his character why is he saying uh okay  now now hold on there sandy ron the lawyer does she have some kind of a case with the time she has  spent and put into this without him doing anything uh is there any claims she can make on the fact that  she's done this for three years no but but you know what i'm trying to help you know what she has gone  for she hasn't gone for the fact that i i would seriously doubt if this naked cowboy who's probably  making uh you know twenty five thousand dollars a year on this bullshit uh if if he is making that 
[01:20:30]  much money yeah very seriously if sandy is impacting his uh income ah 25 cents i don't think there's  anybody sitting around saying now let's see what am i going to do this afternoon with the kids let's  go see the naked cowboy or wait wait wait wait now there's a naked cowboy let's go see her even  though she's 80 years old and looks like shit i mean you know let's go through this so let's go  to go see the naked cowboy we'll spend our money on it seriously seriously seriously he's not hurting 
[01:21:00]  her she's not hurting him right she's not she's not bothering this guy and a judge if the judge  were to look at this if i were the judge looking at this i'd say look this is bullshit i mean come  on cowboy relax you know i mean this lady's not taking a penny out of your pocket let her do her  thing she'll get tired of it in a couple of months anyway and go back to the home you know it's it's it's  it's a third fucking year baby and i got a brand new cds yeah but you got to make it i see what  ron's doing he's kind of making it sound like he's hoping this is this is just going to be blown  off in no time he's she he's not taking any money out of uh she's not taking any money out of his 
[01:21:30]  pocket and uh you know don't worry about it hey sandy's just having fun this cowboy guy ought to  relax yeah downplay it yeah we don't like the naked cowboy in the end he ought to show up he ought to  show up at your press conference he ought to show up at your press conference with the  associated press you ought to show up try and get on stage you ought to try and get up there with  you uh so who has a better set of tits probably he does they're saying that it's not associated  press it's aging prostitutes that she's meeting i got a bigger dick i got more balls all right 
[01:22:00]  lately he's stalking me and i was the one that got the lawyer and and and read the letter to his  he wasn't even going to take action i took sandy why don't you get a restraining order then if  he's stalking you right ron the lawyer hey you know sandy i'm sure you're completely in the right  here and i'm sure you're going to eventually prevail because already you got a lot of press  you've been in the post you've been in the news you've been on tv you've been on the radio uh  you're doing okay you got nothing to worry about that you got nothing to worry about here because 
[01:22:30]  the worst that's going to happen is somewhere down the line someday some judge is going to tell you to  shut the fuck up and sit down and and and go home and i'm sure you will because you don't want to  get involved with a contempt situation and get locked up now the cowboy once again i think probably  50 times more people ever heard of that naked cowboy have heard of him now because of you know  what you've apparently instigated ah see i agree this thing going so it's not stupid either the  cowboy's got to get his publicity out of it you know but the cowboy's pretending that somehow you're 
[01:23:00]  impacting his ability to make a living he's just another asshole out there with you know trying to  get publicity yeah absolutely god damn ron ron knows how to make a summation yeah he's still  laughing i gotta ask ron the lawyer if you had sandy kane in court would you have a nervous breakdown  no man i love that candy kane in court candy kane you know she she it's sandy right yeah sandy yeah  yeah sandy you know look sandy i mean the only problem you've got pal is if you start taking  yourself too seriously with this i mean if you realize it's just a big goof that's fine but if you 
[01:23:30]  really start taking yourself seriously start thinking yourself as a lindsey lohan or some  serious performer as opposed to somebody who's just busting balls then then you know i'm gonna  have to look at you again but if you want to go in there with the right attitude which is hey i'm  just talking around you know and the cowboy's getting upset maybe he's getting upset i don't  know i don't know maybe he's a little bit too cool to get upset but if he's if this guy's really  getting upset i'm thinking you know i'm gonna have to take another look at you because you know you  know sandy this is all just bullshit just it's just it's basically a fun thing i hope you're enjoying 
[01:24:00]  yourself with this because it's good yeah there's no downside to you yeah if i'm up in new york i  might even come down take a look at you anyway you look you look any better i'm a jersey oh i'm a  jersey i'm sitting down here i'm sitting down here on the beach right now yeah i'm just sitting down  here on the beach right now nice as i'm listening to you ron's living large yeah ron is living uh large  getting some great advice today no i am i am and i appreciate it any questions for ron the lawyer because  this is free shit he usually charges i don't know oh my god lots and lots of money per hour 
[01:24:30]  so uh well no i'm going you know i'm just you know you say it's it's you know it's a laugh it's  not i mean i'm i'm having love jesus uh let me let me talk for sandy kane ron the lawyer she's  going to be in front of the ap today so she's going to be able to sell herself well what would you  suggest today sandy listen closely sandy don't go don't go crazy sandy just you know talk seriously  about the fact that you're not impacting this guy's income in any way and and indicate that 
[01:25:00]  this guy thinks he's been he's been hurt financially in some way by what you're doing  come on out let's see his returns let's see whether or not that's the case it's not the case i know it's  not the case i think anybody out there is going to know it's not the case let's talk about it on a  serious level you know and and and you know and uh also don't don't take yourself too seriously  here sandy don't get carried away girl yeah i mean she's going to blow all the money on a forensic  accountant if this guy wants to come on if this guy wants to come on seriously with this  shit the guy's going to sound like a real asshole that's true hey don't worry about ending up in 
[01:25:30]  front of a judge because most of the judges out there are pretty cool and they're going to  understand what's going on and just dismiss it steve get get the naked cowboy on the phone uh  ron would you talk to the naked cowboy absolutely bring him on all right we're going to get the  naked cowboy on uh sandy k and you can listen in we're trying to help you out here yeah come on  henry you afraid of the naked cowboy you afraid to talk to the naked cowboy yes yeah you intimidated

[01:27:00]  do it at my house i could do it on my blackberry i could yeah you could do it on your blackberry  conference i think so yeah that's great two phone all right we're just stalling because we're  we're calling him i don't know if he's picking up do you have the number nine one seven oh hold on  no no no no no no hold on sandy sandy don't just blurt out the phone number uh  uh naked cowboy you're on the opian anthony show i see that uh you're officially 
[01:27:30]  suing sandy kane the naked cow girl yes sir and we got ron the lawyer on the line here  wants to ask you a few questions okay he's our resident uh lawyer yeah so uh ron the lawyer you're  on with uh the naked cowboy big case going down hey cowboy are you are you taking the position that  this this this woman has somehow another cost you some money say that one more time i said are you  taking the position this lady has somehow cost you some money absolutely yeah how does she cost 
[01:28:00]  you money well you think you think people decide whether to go see the whether to go see the  naked cowboy the naked cowgirl they're going to go see her instead of you and take away from your  income somehow everyone on the planet how does she cost you money well if you'll shut up long  and have to listen i'll tell you everybody in the world people come from all over the world to see  the naked cowboy and they're coming to time square specifically to see that entity they're doing  that because of the goodwill i've created associated with the name when people come to 
[01:28:30]  time square and they first of all not everyone recognizes or knows that i'm an adonis a sweet  loving great wonderful guy they just know that's a naked cowboy and it's a very generic kind of turn  to them and when they show up they're looking for the naked cowboy and they're in a 12 13 block  radius and they well they stumble across the naked cowgirl which is very inconsistent with those  qualities although it does have the same exact trademark name naked cowgirl naked cowboy we know 
[01:29:00]  that because when we applied for the naked cowgirl trademark it was denied on the grounds that it was  too likely to confuse confusion or to create confusion based on naked cowboy that's why that  that was rejected when a naked cowgirl tried to wish to care of the name so we know that the  likelihood of confusion is there based on the world patent and trademark office so now when  people come to time square and let's get past some of this bullshit can we get past some of this 
[01:29:30]  bullshit about your trademark how much money did you make as your naked cowboy last year what's on  your federal tax return how much did you make last year how much you can how much less you're going to  make this year because this girl is out there and by the way she's doing you a favor well that or that  your favorite by getting your picture in a favor i never heard of the goddamn naked cowboy until she  got into this and neither did anybody else and if you think anybody's going to time square to see  you you're delusional nobody's going up there to see you there's a million things in time square  they're going to see and it ain't the naked cowboy i got i got a big shocker for you and if you believe  that you take yourself much too seriously much too seriously and as soon as you get in front of a 
[01:30:00]  judge i think a judge is going to take one look at you listen to you and say this guy's a  fucking asshole and maybe we'll tell her to stop maybe we won't but in any event this guy takes  himself much too seriously and they're going to say well here's what they're going to be thinking  get the fuck out of here well the office of tourism in new york city now has naked cowboy listed as a  third-rated tourist attraction in the city so maybe they're taking me too seriously as well i think i  think anybody anybody taking you too seriously they're really buying into this naked cowboy hey god bless 
[01:30:30]  you man i hope you can make a lot of money with this shit but if you think if you think seriously  that this woman is cutting into your act by by getting out there and parading around you got  how old is she 90 years old or something parading out there somebody can say well here's a naked  cowgirl uh somehow she's diminishing diminishing your act let's not bother going to see this naked  cowboy whatever it is you do and i have no idea i've seen picture you with a guitar so i guess you  sing and play and walk around in your underpants you know he's a character but but but the bottom line  is this woman's not this woman's not bothering you you should get off her case now look it's good 
[01:31:00]  publicity i'm sure you're having a good time with this i'm sure a lot of people have heard you now  that haven't heard you before like me but i mean if you seriously expect anybody to leave that this  woman is hurting your income and somehow it's diminishing your role in society which nobody knows  what the hell it is anyway uh then you're you're you're delusional that's all and you got to get  it well why don't we do what we'll just do it mike mike tyson always says just come to the fight  there's no question whatsoever that we do have a trademark on the name naked cowboy there's no 
[01:31:30]  question that naked cowboy was denied on the grounds that it was too similar to naked cowboy  making that a property of ours which is another we're going to have naked would you dispute with  me cowboy that this woman has done you a favor by getting you in the paper by getting you in the  post by getting you in the news by getting you on the radio by getting you on tv would you dispute that  this woman has done you a favor by getting you a pile of publicity that's irrelevant everything  It's not irrelevant.  It's not irrelevant.  Would you dispute that she's done you a favor,  that more people know about the naked cowboy now than ever did three months ago? 
[01:32:00]  Would you seriously dispute that with me?  I'm just entitled to publicity with my deals.  I'm also entitled to the money that the deals create.  You should be paying this woman.  You should be kicking over some of your income to this woman this year.  You should be giving her $10,000 for just being your publicity agency.  We'll see.  Well, you're going to see.  I know I'm on the side of the law,  and I'm just protecting the property that I've worked in here.  I know.  It's a valuable property.  Well, good luck, cowboy. 
[01:32:30]  Well, uh...  But, you know, but, hey, if you come off taking your tells you seriously,  people are going to think you're a real asshole.  I mean, you want to take this...  I've got to write to my trademark and so on.  But you come on with this shit about, you know,  even suggest that this woman's hurting you in any way  as opposed to helping you with what she's really doing.  You're going to be regarded as just a real asshole.  That's in court.  That's in the papers.  That's in the general public.  So stick around.  Well, clearly I'm not with what people think.  Hmm.  Why don't we put Ron for a second on hold?  Ron, could you hold on for a second? 
[01:33:00]  Hold on a minute there.  Yeah.  All right.  Sandy Kane, you're on with the Naked Cowboy.  Let's try to work this out.  Hello, Steve.  Hello, Bobby Jerk.  Hello.  What's up?  What's up?  You.  No, I mean, I'm kind of overwhelmed here  because you were my friend.  Now you're my fucking enemy.  And it just, I'm confused.  You're not my enemy.  You're no enemy of mine whatsoever.  As far as the very first day I saw you, 
[01:33:30]  I've been nothing but friendly and compliant with you.  I've never had any problem with it whatsoever.  It wasn't until you started asking me to sing on and out  or to say that I was singing on an album  that I was not singing on,  that I simply said I know that's not legal  and you'll have to talk to Todd.  I explained that.  It never came out, Robert.  It never came out.  It's not like I put it out on Capitol Records  and said it was real.  It never fucking came out.  No, you put it out on a CD with BMI record.  With BMI, that's what you did. 
[01:34:00]  And we have the product.  I did not, man.  You're a fucking liar, man.  I never put it out.  And the only one that got a copy with your name on it  was you.  I gave it to you.  You know?  And I'm more than happy to send you a copy of the CD  with my name on it that I'm not on.  By the way, if she gave it to you,  Valtrek should help you out.  Yeah.  And that was just saying,  it never came out, Robert.  That was just for you and Todd, your manager,  to see what it would look like on the charts 
[01:34:30]  if it ever got there.  The CD is out.  The charts.  You know, and it has no mention of you.  Wayne, you asked me if I would say that I was singing  when I wasn't.  I told you that would not be legal.  When I told you I would even sing on it  if you would just formalize the process,  actually sign the franchise agreement  and do it legally.  $5,000.  Off and off and off.  And then when we sent a legal cease and desist letter  to tell you that it was simply not going to be accepted,  you simply said,  we don't care and kept moving forward. 
[01:35:00]  And when you were given a deadline  to stop using my property,  you continued to use the property  and that's where you were sued.  There's no mix-up asshole.  How come you didn't tell me that  three years ago, Robert?  How come you didn't sell the original  naked cowgirl, 2005?  For the same reason,  I would not walk up to any senior citizen  wearing my clothes and be mean or cruel or unkind.  I saw a person that was mimicking me  that had no idea the extent of it.  It was just a person wearing my underwear  and in that sense, it would be no problem. 
[01:35:30]  On day two, it would be no problem.  Someone does it for several years,  it starts to become an irritant.  And as you know, my management,  not me, that's not my job to come and get you,  it's my manager's job.  I work in the streets  and I'm the spokesperson for my thing.  I don't go out there and have legal disputes  with people on the street,  nor do I even talk to people about personal things.  I'm working when I'm out there.  My manager is the one who has consistently  sent you the contract to ask you to sign it  and you kept putting it up.  When you started to commercialize it,  she doesn't even have $5,000. 
[01:36:00]  When you stopped being Sandy Kane  and just using Naked Cowgirl  as a vehicle to help this poor Sandy Kane  get a little attention,  and you converted,  and when you converted yourself  over to Naked Cowgirl  and started using that name commercially  and to promote yourself,  that's when it became a problem.  And that's why the intensity was picked up.  And when you started making product  and putting ads in national papers  calling yourself the Naked Cowgirl, 
[01:36:30]  which is not legal,  we then sent a cease and desist.  And when you did not cease and desist,  you pushed us with no choice  by going to the thing,  saying that the product that the brand had,  if it had no validity,  why would you go out and wear it?  If it didn't create value for you,  why don't you just come up with something else?  You're using it because of the goodwill  that is associated.  People come to me all day long and say,  hey, where's the Naked Cowgirl?  They've been saying that since the day I got there,  long before you even know them.  Oh, man.  He's got a point now.  It's a comment. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, where's Cowgirl?  Is that your grandma?  Is that your mom?  Is that your sister?  All day long.  Oh, well, we didn't see Cowboy,  but we got a picture with the Cowgirl.  And in the 10-1-3...  Yeah, well, it's going to still happen, too, man.  Yeah!  Oh, Sandy's got some gumption.  All right, hold on a minute.  I think Sandy needs a little help.  So you're defying the law, Sandy.  She's on hold for a second.  Wow.  Ron.  Yeah.  Ah, relief pitcher.  We need a little help here.  You're on with the Naked Cowboy again.  Cowboy, Cowboy, you never answered my question before,  which is, is it your position, 
[01:37:30]  this woman is somehow costing you money?  Absolutely.  And we will determine that  by the discovery that's been sent,  along with, I don't know how we explain it,  but I guess we're asking to enjoy,  somehow asking the judge to file injunction to stop her,  but also a discovery type of thing to determine  so she can just simply report what she's making.  And then we'll have an idea of how much she is actually making as a result.  Well, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Handhandlers suing each other.  You think whatever money she's making  means you're making that much less money? 
[01:38:00]  You think money she may be making  is taking money out of your pocket?  Once again.  There's people thinking,  I don't know whether we're going to go see the Naked Cowboy  or the Naked Cowgirl.  I think we're going to go see the Naked Cowgirl instead.  You think that's what's happening here?  That is happening, but that's not my concern.  The concern is not, this is not about a financial windfall.  It's about protecting the integrity of the brand.  I have sponsors all over the world.  I have Naked Cowboy oysters  that are selling in restaurants all over. 
[01:38:30]  I mean, we have a number, a multitude of products.  We could have Sandy Kane clams.  Nobody's going to buy these products.  Nobody's going to buy these products.  Nobody's going to buy these products.  They are buying these products,  and I make a great deal of money.  That one clam you never eat.  There's too much going on with it.  That's a little off.  Too much hanging off the sides.  Cowboy, you're going to find out, Cowboy,  that even if you are,  let's assume you're reporting all your income.  I'm going to tell you that you're not losing 10 cents  because of this woman,  and she's doing you a big favor  because you're on the radio right now. 
[01:39:00]  You're not a big favor.  You're getting a lot of a big...  It's not protecting the integrity of the brand.  Do you not like all this publicity you're getting now?  Do you not like all this publicity she's generating from you?  You don't think that's going to help you?  You two are arguing apples and prunes.  Exactly.  You see, one guy's arguing the money, Ron,  and then Naked Cowboy is just arguing  the point of the integrity of his product.  He doesn't think Sandy Kane is representing,  and he's damaging somehow the integrity of the Naked Cowboy. 
[01:39:30]  He is the Naked Cowboy.  He's the Naked Cowboy.  What is he talking about the integrity of his product?  Who are we kidding here?  He's talking about endorsements from all over the world,  stuff like that.  Why would the World Patent and Trademark Office  issue me a trademark that I've had for over 10 years  and then be able to successfully license it  to a multitude of products  and defend it several times  if that was not valid property,  if it were not intellectual property?  How can you be an attorney  and not recognize that as an intellectual property?  Oh, shit! 
[01:40:00]  Downing your credentials.  It may be intellectual property, Cowboy.  It may be intellectual property,  but my question is,  is it really being damaged  by what this woman is doing?  Maybe this is apples and prunes,  but the bottom line is,  I see her making you money.  She's putting money in your pocket  right this minute.  She's putting money in your pocket.  Once again,  you're looking at the surface.  If a person has a property  and if I create a big product  and I say,  oh, hey, everybody just come  and take it and do it ever you want, 
[01:40:30]  I don't care.  What does that say about the value of it?  It says it has no value.  But if you do something,  you take care of it,  obviously it has value.  Ron the lawyer,  Ron the lawyer.  Cowboy.  Let me just address one more thing.  Cowboy,  if there was another cowboy out there  running around calling himself  a naked cowboy,  I'd be behind you 100%.  This is a 90-year-old woman.  It's all gone.  This woman is not a competitor of yours.  This woman is not taking your trademark.  This woman's not costing you money.  This woman's not hurting you in any way.  She's helping you. 
[01:41:00]  But I think the naked cowboy is saying  that that in itself,  that in itself is ruining  the integrity of his product.  And why indeed would he file  for a trademark  and spend the money and time to do that  if it's not going to protect his product?  Well, because it would protect him  from another naked cowboy coming along.  It would protect him  from somebody doing the exact same thing he does.  But this isn't it.  If anything,  this is a spoof.  If anything, 
[01:41:30]  I don't know.  It's like a parody.  Yeah, it's like a parody.  It's under the rules of parody, I think.  It's not a parody.  There are several reasons  why it's not a parody as well.  Oh, excuse me.  Naked cowboy Esquire.  Yeah, no kidding.  Hold on, Ron the lawyer.  We've got to go back to Sandy Kane.  Too bad we don't have a three-way  on this fucking phone system.  Yeah, wouldn't that be great?  So, Sandy,  came back to you.  You're defying everybody  and you're going to continue  being the naked cowgirl.  Definitely.  And listen,  if he had a little person  of fuckingality  and changed his fucking outfit 
[01:42:00]  a little bit,  he'd be, you know,  that's what he,  he's just jealous  because I'm making fucking,  you know,  people like me more  than they like him  because he has no fucking personality.  He doesn't care about fucking people  and I do.  So, and that's it.  And I live in fucking Times Square.  He lives in Jersey.  So, you know,  I mean,  it's been my turf  for many, many years  and it's still my turf.  Turf war.  Turf war, Opie.  I hear you.  Naked cowboy.  I think there's, 
[01:42:30]  there's validity in that,  you know,  that, um,  there is validity  that is,  I live in fucking Times Square  for years.  He doesn't even live in New York  and he doesn't pay taxes  in New York.  I do.  Oh, damn.  Oh, she brought up the tax thing.  Naked cowboy,  any rebuttal  to what Sandy Cain  has just said?  Uh, well, again,  this case is going to be  based on law,  not on irrelevant, uh,  psychobabble.  I think she's going to use  the psychobabble defense. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah, my trade was an attorney.  I paid taxes.  I paid money  out of all the money I made.  All right.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm dead.  How much are we talking  at this point?  Tens of dollars  is up for grabs here?  Well, once again,  it's not about a financial  wall.  It's about protecting  his product.  It's his brand  and his product  and he wants it protected  and believes Sandy Cain  is a, uh,  a mark,  a black mark  on his, uh, product.  So why don't we do  some final thoughts here?  Naked Cowboy,  summarize, please. 
[01:43:30]  Summarize?  Well, uh,  once again,  uh,  I created a  globally now  recognized brand.  We've successfully  licensed it  for a multitude  of products.  Our big one  is Naked Cowboy Oysters.  Um,  I've worked for  literally...  Sandy Cain's got crabs.  Specifically,  big ones, too.  Look at Sandy Cain.  She's laughing.  I love Sandy Cain.  She should market,  she should market 
[01:44:00]  Twato.  Oh, God,  Twato, please.  Twato's.  Oh, like chips?  Yes, Twato's.  So, so you,  you want, uh,  you want your product,  uh, which is  the Naked Cowboy,  a trademark,  protected,  uh, regardless  of, uh, financial...  It is protected  and we spent,  again,  came along years ago  and started using  the brand.  I've already done one  That's good for you.  ...looks of low means  and could use it  to simply promote  our own self.  When you start using  it commercially,  it became that point.  Right.  Okay.  So we simply  asked her to stop 
[01:44:30]  and as you know,  she just simply  breaking the law.  She's defying,  she's defying the court order.  So the lawsuit's  going to move forward.  ...excusing the situation  to publicize herself  but ultimately  it's going to end up  in a defeat  and that's enough,  you know.  Well, you're getting  a lot of publicity  out of this, though,  Naked Cowboy.  Not the point.  So he moves forward  with the lawsuit.  Uh, Sandy Kane,  final thought.  Sandy, wrap up.  Um, well, um,  all I can say is,  wait, wait one second.  She's a lunatic. 
[01:45:00]  Naked Cowboy,  I think if you just  play this tape,  you win.  She's a lunatic.  It's all about my music.  I'm a singer-songwriter.  I'm getting  the fucking CD out  and I am a singer-songwriter.  He's just a bullshit bastard  and I'm going to keep going  with my singing songwriting  and I don't need  his fucking voice  on the fucking song.  You putting out CDs?  You putting out CDs? 
[01:45:30]  Or STDs?  When's it dropping?  Huh?  When's it dropping?  It wouldn't mean  it's dropping.  It's, you know,  I got it.  No, not the CD.  Your uterus.  Long wait.  But, um, I know.  All right, thank you,  Sandy Kane.  That's your final thought.  I'm coming a mile away.  Sandy Kane,  the naked cowboy  and finally,  Ron the lawyer,  your final thoughts, sir.  Hey, you know,  I'm a little disappointed  because when I read  about the naked cowboy,  I thought this guy  at least has some sense of humor.  I mean, what the hell?  I don't know if he has 
[01:46:00]  any education,  any skills,  anything he can do,  but the bottom line  is he can walk around  his underpants  in Times Square  and play the guitar.  And he's managed  to put together,  you know,  some kind of living in it.  But if he thinks  that this woman  is in any way  doing anything  but helping him,  the man is delusional.  He takes himself  much too seriously.  When this thing  eventually comes to court,  here's what's going to happen.  He will probably get  a cease and desist order  against her  and she won't be able  to do her  naked cowgirl act again.  But the downside is  anybody who pays attention  to this stuff at all  who would even consider 
[01:46:30]  going to Times Square  to see the naked cowboy  to begin with  is going to think,  what a fucking asshole.  Put some old lady  out of business  who's just fucking around.  I mean, come on.  You know, relax.  Relax, cowboy.  That's my advice.  Let me just say  one more thing.  There's also a Cindy Fox  and there's also a Louise Holman,  both of them,  working as licensed,  naked cowgirls  that work in Times Square  taking pictures every day  doing the same thing.  They just simply file,  they sign the agreement  respecting the intellectual property,  they make their money,  and in those two cases 
[01:47:00]  they're like 1%.  They make 1% of their sales.  They come to Naked Cowboy.  They report their own income.  We make money every month.  There's plenty of opportunity  for other naked cowboys  and naked cowgirls.  You just simply,  if you're going to use the name  or a name that's so similar  that it's likely to confusion  to confuse,  create confusion  in the marketplace,  then you simply have to  pay a licensing fee.  That's how all...  I'm going to give you,  I'm going to give you  some good advice.  Cowboy,  Cowboy,  I'm going to give you  some good advice.  Listen up.  Take it.  Okay?  Go in the fucking newspapers. 
[01:47:30]  Tell them you're dropping your suit.  Tell them you feel sorry for Sandy.  Tell them you're supporting her.  You hope she can make a living  out of this.  Tell them that you have  no animosity towards her.  You're not going to be vindictive.  You're going to withdraw your suit.  You don't want to cost the lady  any money.  You walk away with some good PR.  The way you're going,  everybody's going to think  this cowboy's just an asshole.  You want that?  Continue along.  Of course, you're going.  All right.  That's it.  That's it.  That's how we wrap up.  Thank you, everybody.  Ron the Lawyer,  Naked Cowboy,  and of course,  Sandy Kane.  The great Sandy Kane.  We will all be watching  to see how this turns out  in the coming weeks and months. 
[01:48:00]  All right.  And Ron the Lawyer,  great, great phone call.  Can't wait to get you back  on the show.  Ron rules.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  All right.  Ron the Lawyer, everyone.  We're going to take a quick break  and continue with the show.  What controversy.  Amazing.  This is bigger than anything.  The oil spill.  It's unbelievable.  Lindsay Lohan.  This.  We are your news station.  They better get the audio  to the fucking AP.  Oh, my God.  Actually, this is on the front page  of MSN today.  Is it really?  Yes, it's everywhere.  And then someone said 
[01:48:30]  it's in the New Zealand paper today.  New Zealand.  We got them talking today together.  To sheep fuckers.  So farm out that audio.  I see headlines for us.  Oh, I see headlines.  Headlines.  Headlines.  Bringing them all together.  Ron.  That fucking Ron.  I love Ron the Lawyer.  Dude, it's hysterical.  I love him.  All right.  Listen, passion of the Popeye  as we go to break.  In a time of economic depression  and ruthless dictatorship,  one man would unify 
[01:49:00]  an entire society.  I'm the Messiah.  With a message of strength.  Oh, look.  I'm walking on water.  A message of unity.  Eats my bodies.  Eats my bodies.  Drinks my blood.  A can of spinach.  I am the savior, man.  But some questioned his power. 
[01:49:30]  I hate those Jews.  And vowed to destroy him.  It's Pontius Brutus.  This summer.  A crown of thorns.  A crown of thorns is hurting me head.  Prepare to be blown down.  Then nails get me to the cross.  When an ordinary sailor man  is transformed into a legend.  If I could only get to my spinach  through these nails.  The passion of Popeye. 
[01:50:00]  A blowin' through me hands.  The government and parents everywhere.  They tried to ban it.  This is the virus.  On Sirius XM.

This is the O.P. and Anthony Show  on the virus.  Sirius XM.  Ron the lawyer rules.  We welcome Colin Cain to the show.  What's up?  Very funny comedian.  That I've seen many, many, many, many, many,  way too many times at Carolines.  Waiting for him to hit the next level. 
[01:51:30]  So we're trying to help him out a little bit.  Very funny fucking comic.  Colin Cain with a K on Twitter.  And you're playing West End Johnnies in Boston?  I am.  West End Johnnies is Saturday, 7.30.  Of course, my plug sheet says Friday.  It's definitely...  Definitely Saturday.  Definitely Saturday.  Okay.  Saturday, West End Johnnies  for everybody in the Boston area.  I recommend you see Colin Cain.  Absolutely.  Ron the lawyer.  What'd you think of him?  Ron rolled. 
[01:52:00]  You like the Ron there?  Ron was the shit.  When he fucking...  My favorite part was like,  yeah, you're gonna go into the court  and the judge is just gonna go,  who's this asshole?  It's like fucking...  That's his advice.  Yeah, and he's just a fast-talking fucking...  Yeah.  Hey, what do you do, character?  What happened with Ron the lawyer,  he came in here and we just played,  you know,  the production piece they put together  with his audio.  He was unbelievable how great he was  for our show.  But then I think we kind of 
[01:52:30]  fucked up his reputation,  so we had to arrest him.  But now he's back.  I think he's back.  He doesn't care now.  He's gonna just tell it like it is  for us when we need legal advice.  And Sandy Cain,  holy shit,  she's defying the lawsuit, Anthony.  Yeah.  And she's gonna continue  being the naked cowgirl.  I think they should team up.  I think that she should just,  you know,  be like the horse  in Times Square.  And he's just a cowboy.  That's what I think.  Oh, there you go.  I also think I should start the show 
[01:53:00]  with a horrific joke.  Just to set the tone.  I just opened my mouth,  you guys are just swiveled like,  yeah, we'll do that.  Yeah, that sounds good.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Get on that.  Get on that.  Is that a joke or a suggestion?  I wasn't sure.  How about this, Kyle?  Why don't you get on that horse  and get the fuck out of here?  And the horse that you came in on.  That's right there.  I thought that's funny.  You just put a saddle on her  and just tie her up in front of  like TGI Fridays or something.  Oh, man.  What a feed bag on her face.  Yeah, this is like Major League Baseball. 
[01:53:30]  You only have to hit 300,  so don't worry about it.  You get a couple doubles  before 1030,  you'll be all right, okay?  All right?  First that bad might be a strikeout.  I don't know.  Oh, it's good.  I just got pegged in the head.  You'll come back.  Yeah, you'll come back.  Shake it off.  Shake it off.  Walk it off.  Couple things.  We were talking about Selena Gomez  because she's 18 today,  and I'm openly admitting  that I kind of have a thing  for this Selena Gomez.  So then a bunch of people  on Instant Feedback  are saying that I'm the pedo  and not Anthony.  I mean, it's well documented 
[01:54:00]  that Anthony's a pedophile, basically.  But I am not a pedophile.  I might fess up to pedarrest.  I'm not a pedophile.  If you're going to talk pedo,  I'll say this in my defense.  I like my young girls  to look like women.  Anthony likes young girls  to look like young girls.  That's the difference  between me and Anthony  and the pedo thing.  No, I like old...  See, like Letterman,  he's looking at Selena Gomez,  and when he interviewed her  a few days ago,  she was still 17,  and he was...  Because he was basically saying 
[01:54:30]  you don't look like you're 17,  so that's where the confusion is.  Yes.  Okay?  No, I like my old women  to look like young girls.  That's odd.  I like Sandy Kane.  Yeah, we...  Let's get Sandy Kane in pigtails.  We were discussing...  We were discussing some shit  during the break,  and Anthony just came up  with the bit,  and we will do it,  hopefully, if we can, tomorrow.  Yeah, yeah, this has got to be around.  We want to bring Sandy Kane in,  and we want to see how young  we can make Sandy Kane 
[01:55:00]  in a makeover.  Yeah.  How young we can make Sandy Kane...  And how old is she officially?  Well, she admits to...  I think she admits to, like, 55.  55?  55?  Yes.  Yeah, yeah, that's just bizarre.  And her big thing is like,  Sandy, how old are you?  Can you keep a secret?  And you go, yeah.  So can I.  Ah!  Ah, ah, ah, ah, man.  She's got some stock jokes, Colin,  that she uses over and over again.  But if I had to guess,  I don't want to insult her. 
[01:55:30]  I'd say, like, 71.  She's pushing...  She's got to be pushing 70.  Oh, come on.  She has to be.  She was fucking dancing nude  in Times Square  when, like,  they were...  They were filming, like,  the opening to The Odd Couple  with those big, nasty old buses,  and every corner  had a chock full of nuts.  Wow.  She was in Times Square  when it was just, like,  one corner, I think.  It didn't meet.  No.  What was it?  What was it, the Five Points?  What movie?  Yeah, yeah.  The Butcher? 
[01:56:00]  I don't think that was Times Square.  Gangs of New York.  That was downtown, though.  Yeah.  That was downtown.  I just danced the Five Points,  man.  Dead Rabbits.  Dead Rabbits.  There you go.  Good call.  That's what I did, man.  How young could you make her?  I fucked the butcher.  He raped me,  and then he made some steak for me,  and I hung out, man.  Oh.  But we want to see  how young we can make her.  Yeah.  So we're obviously thinking  you go with the pigtails right away,  so that might knock a few months off  instead of years. 
[01:56:30]  Then we're thinking braces.  Yeah, some braces.  Some kind of fucking push-up bra.  Something to kind of  hoist those fuckers.  Hoist their tits back up.  Yeah.  And then I'm thinking eye makeup,  that real dark, smoky,  goth chick-looking eye makeup.  What else can we do to her  to make her look younger?  Oh, you came up with  the Catholic schoolgirl thing.  Yeah, Catholic schoolgirl outfit.  Yeah, we could do that. 
[01:57:00]  Horrific.  A little plaid with the white shirt  kind of a thing.  And then tied.  Like tied.  He knows the exact outfit.  He's like,  it's got to be tied  above the belly button.  I've talked to these girls  that went to Catholic school,  and they were the worst, man.  They were like,  because their parents just  kept such a fucking thumb on them  all the time  that when they went out,  they went bullshit fucking crazy.  And they would take  their Catholic school skirts 
[01:57:30]  when they got out of school  and roll them up  at the waistband.  I've seen that, yeah.  So the fucking things  turn into like,  little mini skirts,  they take the white shirt  that's tucked in,  untuck it,  and then tie it up  so their belly's showing,  and walk and make me  crash my Apollo air conditioning  work fan  into a fucking pole.  Again.  Again.  Again.  Look at that.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah, that's when  Britney was fucking  the shit.  So why don't we just,  why don't we copy 
[01:58:00]  the Britney Spears look?  That's exactly what  we're looking for.  Oh, okay, knee socks.  She needs the big, tall  socks that go over the knees.  Some heels that  she won't fall off of  and break her fucking  Triscuit hips.  How do we get this done?  Do we need a makeup artist?  We need all this shit.  Yeah.  We need somebody,  we need a professional  makeup artist that knows  how to.  That's who you need. 
[01:58:30]  A makeup artist that has an M80.  You need an industrial.  We need a mortician.  A mortician.  A mortician.  And a couple union guys  and power washers.  And we could just.  A couple of spacklers.  Yeah.  Hold on, new bit.  How young are we going to  make Santa Cain,  but we use like the  mortician's fucking  makeup artist?  Yeah.  Yeah, we could do that.  They'd actually look at her  and get tips.  Yeah, Janine does makeup.  Huh?  Janine does makeup.  That's what I thought.  Janine, get your ass in here.  Could she get all this stuff?  Janine could probably do that.  Janine, this is your bit.  Stop making balloon animals,  you fucking lunatic. 
[01:59:00]  And get some makeup.  Could she get the skirt  and all that?  And the fucking socks?  I don't know.  And the little,  what are the fucking,  what are the shoes called?  The, uh, the, uh,  fucking, there's a name for them.  Saddle shoes.  Not saddle shoes.  Saddle shoes.  Where are you?  Fucking 1950?  Some patent leather saddle shoes?  Pat.  You Bobby Soxers?  Patent shoes.  Patent shoes.  That's it.  That's what we want.  Yeah, but you said that you...  Hit me, baby.  This is fucking perfect. 
[01:59:30]  We need some accessories in her hair.  A couple bows.  The little furry things,  bows on the end of her hair.  Tell Janine she's just got a copy of this video.  That's all.  Oh, Jesus, fuck.  She looks so young.  She was fantastic in this video.  Shut us right the fuck up, didn't it?  Sure did.  It's beyond what the fuck happened to ours.  Stop it.  Don't you ruin it.  Don't you ruin it, Danny. 
[02:00:00]  I want Sandy reenacting this song in Times Square with, like, four backup answers.  Maybe she could, like...  In the morning.  Maybe she could rip off Britney Spears now.  Yeah.  In Times Square.  It's the naked Britney.  I'm the naked Britney.  I'm the naked Britney.  Oh, oh.  Come on, man.  All right.  Tell Janine...  Oh, thanks, Danny.  Jesus Christ.  Goddamn time.  Stupid time.  Father time's a cocksucker.  Oh, look at her.  No, Danny back to the good one.  Yeah. 
[02:00:30]  He keeps going back from this video to a brand new Britney pic where she's all fucking just sloppy.  What the fuck?  All right.  Is Janine in or what?  Does she take this bit and run with it?  I think she's in.  All right.  All you have to do is look at the fucking Britney Spears video.  And we have to get all that on Sandy Kane somehow.  Or most of it.  Okay?  Although someone's saying we should make her up like Salma...  Salma Hack.  Oh, thank you.  Jesus. 
[02:01:00]  From Dogma.  Nah.  I always found Salma Hack.  She's sexy, man.  Yeah, but you know what?  For the young thing, to try to make her look young, the Britney...  Hit me, baby, one more time.  That's the benchmark.  Exactly what we're looking for.  That's the benchmark.  By the way, I'm just...  I'm imagining Janine walking in and us having to go,  I need you to use all your talents and all your powers.  Look how they massacred Sandy Kane.  You know, and Vince from Bayonne is like, 
[02:01:30]  Sandy should just turn into the naked schoolgirl.  Yeah, why did she do that?  And they make so much more money than the stupid naked cowboy gimmick.  Yeah, fuck the cowgirl thing.  She could just be the naked fucking schoolgirl.  Yes, let's say hi to Dan in New York.  Dan.  Naked anime.  Happy birthday, Opie.  Naked tub girl.  Is it my birthday today?  Holy shit, it's my birthday today.  Wow, I missed that one.  Happy birthday.  Thank you, Colin.  What do you got, Dan?  I think the best way to make Sandy Kane look young,  you take one of those clips, you put on a chip bag, 
[02:02:00]  and you just pull all that skin back.  A chip bag clip on her loose skin in the back like a Sharpay.  You just pull her face back.  Wow, that would look frightening.  Very nice.  Not like it doesn't already, but...  People suggesting how we make her look younger.  We got Anthony in Mount Sinai.  Good morning, boys.  Anthony.  Hey.  How are you?  Hey, Ian.  We could clip a few years off,  or you could shave the hair around Twato,  and then you could paint it brown and say it's a birthmark. 
[02:02:30]  Twato can't be part of this.  That's funny, man.  Oh, God, Brittany.  God, dude.  Oh, look at that.  She had us all by the balls.  She blew it.  You blew it.  What year did Hit Me Baby one more time come out?  We were at NAW, and we had the poster in our office,  which made everyone creeped out by us.  Remember that, Ian?  That had to be like 99.  That's about right.  That's about right.  We're talking 10 years easy.  About 99. 
[02:03:00]  That's a rough 10 fucking years, man.  When we worked at NAW, we had that poster in our fucking office.  Why wouldn't we?  We also had the Olsen twins.  What the fuck?  Of course we did.  Then the executives and the big salespeople would come in  and try to talk to us about shit.  And we had our posters.  Oh, look how sultry in this picture.  And then go to the other one.  What?  Oh, God damn you, Danny.  It's like the ad on the side of a bus, you know, the before and after.  Yes.  It's like when you look at the crystal meth users over a period of time, 
[02:03:30]  the mug shots.  Go back to that picture.  She's too young still to have lipstick look dry on her lips.  You know what I mean?  It's wicking up the cracks.  That shit happens to the older women.  Old ladies.  Oh, my God.  Was she just smoking?  That video is retarded.  I could jack off to that fucking video.  I have.  Wait a minute.  What am I talking about?  Please don't.  I meant right now, yeah.  That's what I meant.  Please don't. 
[02:04:00]  Not now.  Should we get Sandy Kane back on and see if she's into this bit?  She would so be into it, dude.  Yeah.  She would so be into it.  Oh, my God.  Call her off the air and tell her to fucking.  And, Danny, I'm going to need an image to go along with Bob from Jersey's phone call.  Hey there, bad.  Bob.  Hey, how you doing, boys?  Hey, man.  Hey.  Hey, I think she's going to end up looking like Betty Davis in Whatever Happened to Baby  James.  Ha, ha, ha, yeah.  Oh, God damn.  This will go down as the reference of the day.  Yeah, because this is going to look like. 
[02:04:30]  Look at that.  Pull it off for me.  I don't know that one.  Yeah, you're a little younger.  Pull that one off.  Yeah, this is old school.  This is an old school reference, man.  I mean, we're too old to see her.  I mean, we're too lunatic.  We weren't old enough to see his movie, but.  Yeah, yeah, this movie came out like fucking, it's black and white.  And I think she.  It's Betty Davis.  Betty Davis dressed as a much younger fucking woman.  Yeah, she was trying to look all young.  That's us.  Yeah.  God.  That does look like her.  Eh, eh, and Betty Davis. 
[02:05:00]  I got Betty Davis eyes.  Eh.  Can we get like a, like a, like a mortician or someone that does fucking makeup for dead  bodies to come in?  Mortician.  Why not, man?  Well, we got Janine now.  She's coming in.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  She's going to do that.  She's going to do it like, you know, like legit fucking, uh, uh, big, big eye makeup.  That, that black eyeliner shit.  Avril Lavigne looking smoky eyes.  Perfect.  Sandy Kane.  Yes. 
[02:05:30]  We got a couple things for you.  You're going to come in hopefully very soon.  I don't know if we can pull it off tomorrow.  We would love to pull it off tomorrow.  We want to do it.  I think we're going to need more than 24 hours for this job.  Let's be serious.  Yeah.  We want to send you away.  We want to do a makeover and see how young we can make you look.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  We need, we need pigtails.  We need like fake braces.  We're going to do like a Catholic school girl thing.  Facelift.  Facelift.  Uh.  Wow.  Uh.  Uh.  Knee high socks.  Uh, socks. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  Knee highs and the little patent leather shoes.  And, uh.  And, uh.  No.  Um.  And bombing fluid.  Would you be up for this?  The facelift.  Well.  I said facelift.  Yeah.  That was, that was a joke and you took it serious.  No.  We'll just put rubber bands around your ears by the back of your head.  I got a bungee cord on the hood of my Outback.  Like bungee her ears together from behind her head.  That'll work.  Are you up for this?  I, I'm up. 
[02:06:30]  I'm up.  And, and listen.  Robert, Robert Burke's dick is up.  Well, that would probably be.  Oh, man.  She's, that's the naked cowboy.  That's not an insult.  You should say he can't get it up.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  You're doing it wrong.  Sandy.  Sandy.  You got no dick.  What can I tell you?  Sandy, this is, this is Colin Kane.  Um.  No relation.  I just want, I just want all the listeners to know.  Are we, are we related?  No, no.  Oh, fuck.  I didn't even notice this.  You're related to Sandy Kane?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  It's spelled the same way? 
[02:07:00]  Wow.  Look at that.  I didn't know this.  Colin fucking Kane.  All right.  I got it.  You got it.  You got me.  Hey, do you think you could maybe play the controversial song?  He told me how to love that is done all the fucking shit that's going on.  Yeah, yeah.  No problem.  We'll do that for you.  We'll get right on that probably before the next break.  Yes.  We'll go into break with it.  Sandy.  Sandy, uh, what year were you born?  Uh, can you keep it secret?  I already know that joke.  I know what you're going to say.  Can you, can you really tell me?  That's fine.  Why?  Why do I have to tell you what year I was born?  Because in order to do everything we're talking about, we need to know your age for, like, 
[02:07:30]  the paperwork.  I need to know your age.  Oh, I'm 47.  47.  Okay.  47.  Hello?  40.  I thought I was 98.  And you thought I shaved a few years off.  47.  Wow.  That isn't shaving years off.  That's hatcheting years off.  That's fucking chainsawing years off.  Exactly.  Sandy.  I forgot, you know?  Sandy.  Sandy, a couple things.  Ron, the lawyer, gave you some good advice.  So when you talk to the AP at 1130, make sure you use some of that advice. 
[02:08:00]  And, of course, work us into the story.  We would appreciate that.  Of course.  Also, also, shut up.  Shut up.  We want you to change your act to the naked schoolgirl.  And we think you could make a lot more money in Times Square.  I absolutely think if you wear that Catholic schoolgirl uniform, the knee-high socks, the  patent leather shoes, braces, the pigtails with maybe some furry accessories in your hair  and stuff like that, you could do better.  As the naked schoolgirl, and then you'd have no problem with the cowboy, fuck the cowboy 
[02:08:30]  thing, and you'd just have people taking pictures with you.  You look like a...  No, I love being topless.  It's so free, and it's really...  Well, you could open up the white shirt, the little white Catholic schoolgirl shirt, and  have your tits, you know...  My tits out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Out, down, wherever you want to put them.  Because I think it's a great thing to be topless in Times Square.  It's only in Times Square you can really do this.  All right.  We're just trying to help you.  Man, do what you want.  I know.  But we'll be in touch.  We're going to have you come in to do the makeover thing, okay? 
[02:09:00]  When can we do this?  Monday?  Well, if Janine could get it together for tomorrow, we'd love to do it tomorrow, but  maybe we'll do it early next week.  Yeah.  Early next week makes more sense.  I don't know you don't work on Fridays.  Who?  Wait, Howard?  That's the other guy.  Don't worry about it.  Oh, that's the other guy.  I don't know you don't work on...  I do...  Okay.  I wish.  I'll definitely come in tomorrow.  All right.  Well, we don't know.  Steve will let you know.  We'll set this all up off air.  Ron the lawyer rocked, man.  Yeah, he did.  Ron the lawyer rocked. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  I wish you would take your case on, because you want to talk about publicity.  Oh, yeah.  This guy knows how to talk.  Well, he's a fucking great guy, and he's hysterical, and he gave me a lot of good advice,  and I will mention you...  I'd want a funny lawyer.  That's the thing we're looking for.  Just funny.  Funny lawyer.  He's fucking funny, isn't he?  Whatever it is.  The AP...  What am I doing?  Associated Press.  Yes.  No.  What was AP again?  Oh, aging prostitute.  He's talking about aging prostitute. 
[02:10:00]  Yes.  Right.  All right.  All right.  Okay.  And a fucking schoolgirl with the fucking tits out.  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  Well, we're going to do that soon.  We'll be in touch.  Thank you, Sandy Kane.  Keep it up.  It's up.  Yeah.  Yep.  All right.  It's up.  They're up.  Thanks, guys.  And I will mention you all over that news conference.  All right.  Who's your best pal in the whole world?  Um, my vibrator and my new guitar and Opie and Anthony, man.  You rock. 
[02:10:30]  And thanks for calling me a friend, Opie, even though Anthony disputed it.  No, I wouldn't dispute that.  I was just kidding.  You're absolutely a friend of the show.  I was going.  I was shooting from the hip there, Sandy.  You know how that is.  I hate this naked cowboy.  She doesn't have a hip.  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah.  The naked cowboy made me care about you.  We'll take care of the naked cowboy.  You have enough to worry about.  All right.  Get lost.  Get lost.  Asshole.  All right.  Binder and Binder.  Is that it?  With his stupid hat. 
[02:11:00]  Hey, Kevin from Connecticut is saying that everyone is tweeting the naked cowboy at the  naked cowboy.  That's a little strange.  Really?  We might have to.  Danny, we might have to take a look at the tweets for the naked cowboy today.  All right.  Enough of that nonsense.  But she'll come in and dress like Britney Spears.  Thanks to Janine.  And then to play the fucking song and have her dance to it a little bit, that would just  be hysterical.  I smell YouTube hit.  Oh, sensation.  YouTube hit.  Big time.  You.  That asshole. 
[02:11:30]  Charles Binder.  You have enough to worry about.  We care about you.  And don't worry, little Kathy.  You'll be just fine.  What about the big fat redhead guy with the beard?  Have you seen that guy?  Oh, yeah.  That guy.  For the tax masters.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Tax masters.  They had to update his.  Dude, you know what he looks like?  There's a true story I'll share with you guys.  When I was a kid, this dude rolled up in front of my house.  And I know it's getting weird.  I know.  Oh, jeez.  I can see how this is going.  I'm playing with my neighbor, right?  Just hanging out really young.  This dude pulls up in a blue car. 
[02:12:00]  I remember exactly what it looked like.  Looked exactly like that dude with the red hair.  Pulled that in right there.  I just got.  Don't turn that away.  I can't.  Dude, the guy pulls up in the car, gets out, just stands there, looks at us across the  street, pulls out his dick, and just does like a cigar roll with his  dick.  Listen, this is true.  I'm honest.  The cigar roll.  He does the cigar roll with his dick.  Turn it away.  I don't want to look at it.  Starts rolling it.  That's really upsetting him.  Starts rolling it, looks at us, and just gets away and pulls out.  And that was it.  And he called the cops and everything, and luckily he didn't snatch one of us. 
[02:12:30]  Wow.  Yeah, I remember exactly what the guy looks like, the car and everything.  And that's him.  He's one of those guys that uses his beard to try to cover up that he's got a big  pelican neck.  Yeah.  Like they shave it.  You know what Boy George started doing with the black makeup on his neck to make it  look like he didn't have jowls.  Oh, that was hiding a chin or whatever.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what he's doing with his beard.  Fuck, E-Rock should grow a beard then.  Oh, shit.  Sorry.  You didn't.  Sorry.  No, you didn't.  That was not nice. 
[02:13:00]  It's all just.  I'm lazy.  Oh, God.  So that reminds you of the cigar roll guy?  The cigar roll guy.  I haven't heard about that.  But isn't that like, how old were you?  The other chick.  This was, oh, man, I was probably like eight.  You weren't traumatized, right?  No.  That's a laugh.  I bet you were real.  That's a laugh when you're a bitch.  That's a laugh when you're a bitch.  I bet you're a real tussleable little eight-year-old.  It's a laugh now, but what happens if the dude just grabbed me and pulled out?  Yeah, you know, you've got to go over those what-ifs and just throw them away.  That's good.  It didn't happen.  Get therapy over here.  Don't worry about it.  What if, what if, what if? 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  No, you're right, though.  But I remember with the guy.  If I saw him, I'd reckon that.  But he looks like that, dude.  Wow.  His neck is all hairy.  Like you said, the pelican neck, it's all hairy.  It's like that time when I was in there, we saw Bobo.  His undercarriage, it was just matted.  Oh, just matted fucking hair.  Yeah, that was disgusting.  That's what it was.  The cigar roll jerk is hysterical, though.  Like, who jerks off by just rubbing their hands together?  I know I have.  Like, muah, ha, ha, ha, ha.  And, Pat, you got your dick in between.  Like you're trying to start a fire.  Yeah, yeah.  Like an engine trying to start a fire.  Like an Olympian, like, rosining up. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Who jerks off like that?  What did you say?  What word?  Rosin.  You know how they put the rosin on their hands before they do it?  Which rosin?  It's like for grip, before they go on, like, the uneven bars or something.  Oh, I didn't know the name of that.  Yeah, yeah.  Rosin.  I know I've done that.  I just don't remember the last time I did that.  Yeah.  Especially, yeah.  I mean, I don't remember the last time I did it in, you know, a suburb of Long Island  on a street.  Yeah.  Yeah.  In front of young children.  That guy.  Then there's the other one. 
[02:14:30]  It's like, I'm Ronnie Deutsch.  She's the other lawyer that just is real annoying.  She's the tax lawyer.  She's, uh, the way she says her name, you just want to wrap her in the head.  I'm Ronnie Deutsch.  And it's like, Ronnie Deutsch saved me $10,000 on my tax return.  Or I'll sit on the subway.  I love you, Ronnie.  You'll see all these ads on the subway, too, for these lawyers.  Yeah, yeah.  And it'll be like, you know, $13 million for just some rare disease. 
[02:15:00]  It's just, you know, the numbers that they get.  Yeah, it's like a tote board.  It's like, hey, we had somebody with that mesothelioma walk away with $10 million.  And I'm sitting there with just a metro card looking up.  Like, you know what?  It's like, you start to think, man.  It's not bad with, you know, I'd trade that for concrete lungs.  Just do a few lines of asbestos.  You're right, yeah.  Give the guy a call.  Like a 10 mil.  Yeah, they do put their highlights up on there.  Oh, yeah, they're big ones.  The best is the one guy who's using the guy 1-800-Margarita.  He's a lawyer.  1-800-Margarita.  Margarita?  Pull it up.  I guess if you have peewees. 
[02:15:30]  Wait, he's a lawyer and his number's 1-800-Margarita?  If I'm not mistaken, yes.  Holy shit.  He's kind of smart on his part.  Is it?  Look up.  You know what sucks?  I'm coming up with 1-800 tequila.  That's the problem.  Oh, 1-800.  Hit lawyer Margarita.  Enter lawyer Margarita.  Oh, lawyer.  Yeah, there you go.  There you go.  It pops right up as one of the...  Anything?  Well, I want to get a picture of it.  No.  Nothing?  You're a lying sack of shit.  No, no, no. 
[02:16:00]  Then I'm describing something different then.  What is that?  It looks like the little children that you have to send money to.  Yeah, this is the hair-lip kids.  I hate the hair-lip kids.  Don't put them on buses.  I got to drive.  I don't want to look at a kid that looked like he got a fucking shotgun blast to the upper lip.  He's got a just terrible...  A hairy piece of pot roast.  I don't see this 1-800...  Oh, there you go.  Is that it?  That's the best I could do.  Who called me a liar?  Who called me a liar?  Which one was it?  I apologize. 
[02:16:30]  That was me.  I knew it was something like that.  Oh, it's 1-888.  Oh.  Go 1-888.  Margarita.  But then we'll get more fucking images.  And what are they, Dewey lawyers or something?  And what they do is they target these, you know, the minorities.  So when they see Margarita, they, you know, it's all part of their...  It's like, hey, Margarita.  And then they call them.  Yeah.  Good.  Good idea.  Yeah, there's nothing better than the fucking watching daytime programming and just seeing  the ambulance chasing shit lawyers.  And we're in the middle of an awkward situation.  Pardon?  I said, who the fuck is Ronnie Deutsch, right? 
[02:17:00]  Yeah.  Or whatever the name is?  Yeah.  And Puddle of Aid says, well, Opie, she's been advertising on your channel for at least  a year and a half.  Oops.  Oops.  Better shut up about her.  It just proves advertising doesn't work.  Donnie Deutsch?  Donnie Deutsch?  No, Ronnie.  Ronnie Deutsch is the lawyer.  Donnie Deutsch.  Donnie Deutsch is the guy that had the talk show for a little while.  Still does.  I know he is.  He's the guy.  CNBC.  He just holds his glasses in his hands the whole time he's on the show.  Look at him.  He'd never let go of the glasses.  He's obsessed with his stupid glasses. 
[02:17:30]  We did a show once.  Yeah?  We did one of the first ones.  Yeah, yeah.  Is he an entrepreneur?  I don't think it aired.  Because they didn't know what the fuck they were doing.  Jesus.  So they had to redo the whole first show.  Remember that?  We were on that show.  It never aired.  Yeah.  There he is with his glasses.  The lost files.  Pushed down a little bit.  There he is.  Where were we?  You know on the weekends he just dances on a cube naked shirtless.  Look at that.  Come on.  A man's man.  Yeah, he's something like that.  Shirt's a little too tight.  What's that about?  A little bit.  They got pictures of him in a little fucking ball bag bathing suit. 
[02:18:00]  Would you wear a ball bag bathing suit?  No.  Is that him?  Yeah, I guess so.  I guess that's an old one, huh?  Yeah.  He's kind of coming in.  Hey, Fort Lauderdale.  Look at his tan line.  It looks silly.  You know that he got big and then someone threw that up there.  Yeah, yeah.  That wasn't his headshot.  He didn't like that picture.  Did you guys hear about Arnold Schwarzenegger as I changed topics?  What's going on?  Making jokes. 
[02:18:30]  About?  I don't know.  About the oil leak and Rush Limbaugh.  At a Sacramento press conference.  Terrific material.  Listen to this.  Now, it's really interesting when you talk to energy people and then you get up in the  morning and the first news you hear is good news.  But there's also bad news.  But the good news is that BP has contained the oil leak.  That is good news.  Finally.  Finally. 
[02:19:00]  The bad news is that no one has figured out how to contain Mel Gibson.  Mel Gibson.  Holy shit.  Wow.  That is a bomb.  Why are they laughing?  That's timing.  No one has figured out how to contain Mel Gibson.  Mel Gibson.  Mel Gibson.  I mean, why is he still talking like that?  He's been here for some...  I want to ask you a bunch of questions.  I want to have them answered immediately.  Where is Mel Gibson? 
[02:19:30]  He sounds like he might have went deaf in the last year or so.  What happened?  Right?  That sounds kind of like how a deaf guy...  It's not a tumor.  Oh, maybe he's got a tumor.  Oh, no.  It's not a tumor.  Oh, okay.  Sorry.  He has a tumor.  Shit.  Quiet.  What?  Shut up!  What?  Shut up!  What?  Shut up!  Stop it!  What?  You son of a bitch!  Sorry, Arnold.  Now, Colin Cain, you're a stand-up comedian.  Yeah.  What do you think?  Good timing on the joke and deliver that punchline perfectly? 
[02:20:00]  I don't think Schwarzenegger will ever have good timing.  It's just...  I don't know.  I don't think that's possible with him.  Is it funny?  No.  He's up there talking and people, you know, look at him because he's, you know, in the public  figure and they're going to laugh at what he said, really.  It's one of those.  It's not what, you know, we...  Well, let's hear this punchline again.  Mike Mel Gibson.  Mike Mel Gibson.  Mike Mel Gibson.  Mike Mel Gibson.  Mike Mel Gibson.  Mike Mel Gibson.  Dylan.  Get to the chopper.  You don't know how...  That is good news.  Finally. 
[02:20:30]  Finally.  The bad news is that no one has figured out how to contain Mike Mel Gibson.  Mike Mel Gibson.  Mike Mel Gibson, no one knows how to contain.  So...  That's great.  This is why I want to ask all of you to just please turn off your cell phones because we're  expecting a call from him.  So we want to make sure of that.  He didn't...  He obviously had someone...  He had someone write that for him and he didn't know how to say it and that's why he started.  Yeah.  Because it's not as coming from his own.  And then repeating it again is great. 
[02:21:00]  And then why turn off your cell phones because we're expecting a call from him?  Because he's in a conference.  Isn't what the fuck you're doing?  Oh, that's funny.  I don't get it.  No?  I didn't get that part.  Well, if you're expecting a call from him, then why would you turn off your cell phone?  You're expecting the call.  I think because he's giving a speech.  And when they make the speech, you've got to turn your phones off.  Well, maybe they should have rescheduled the call time from Mike Gibson.  Dude, when I heard that Mel Gibson thing, I couldn't...  I turned it off. 
[02:21:30]  I was like, dude, he's out of his bird.  Yeah, it's fantastic.  I actually turned it off.  I was like, you know what?  It was so just...  We love it.  Nuts.  Oh, I love it, too.  It was so nuts.  Crazy, brutal, and I love it.  I can't get enough.  I was talking last night with somebody, and I was saying, like, he completely got over dropping  the N-bomb.  Like, that was the big thing with the first tape.  Yeah.  When he said that his wife dresses the way she dresses, she should get raped by a pack  of niggers.  Yes.  And then, like, people were like, outraged. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, the racism.  What did he say?  And then that became nothing compared to the rest of the tape.  So, like, even the brothers are just like, motherfucker, that guy's crazy.  They don't care that he dropped the N-bomb.  They don't give a shit.  But...  Because any other actor that would have dropped the N-bomb like that, over.  Yeah.  Like, over.  But no one seems to care.  I think this guy is going to skate this.  He's impervious.  It was just such a crazy rant that, you know, you forgot about it. 
[02:22:30]  That's how crazy it was.  Yeah, because everything else got so much more crazy.  I think it's gone full circle where people are now starting to feel sorry for him, and  that's why he's going to skate.  Yeah, you think?  To get serious for a moment.  Like he's got a problem.  To get serious for a moment.  I think he...  It's so outrageous, so out there, that now people are...  We're actually feeling sorry for him, and now he'll be fine.  That's a problem.  Did they know if he was drunk when he did it?  I don't know.  No one's really saying, but...  Jimmy's speculating that it might have something to do with...  More to do with rage.  ...with the drink.  You look like a fucking bitch on heat, and if you get raped, it'll be your fault. 
[02:23:00]  What?  That's not the fucking version.  You look like a fucking bitch on heat, and if you get raped by a pack of niggers, it'll  be your fault.  Well, it was an edited version.  By the way, E-Rock, you've got to add the rest of the Mel Gibson clips to my fucking...  There's so many new ones.  Sound machine, yeah, man.  Oh, they're fantastic.  You fucking cunt.  Fuck you.  That is just sheer anger.  Rage.  Arnold Schwarzenegger...  Nigger, uh... 
[02:23:30]  Nigger.  Nigger Arnold.  Arnold continued with...  Arnold Pagawatt.  ...with more jokes.  As a matter of fact, I'm very happy that I work out every day one hour, and I'm sure  a lot of you are working out also, so you can relate to it, and you can brag a little  bit that I still, just last week, I lifted 375 pounds.  Yep.  375 pounds.  Here comes the joke.  I lifted Rush Limba out of the chair.  He's happy with himself. 
[02:24:00]  He is.  That'll work.  How the quaid.  Oh, wow.  Is he terrible.  I lifted Rush Limba out of the chair.  But you know, you guys know that when I work at the club, there's always some comic doing  a Schwarzenegger impression.  That's just...  It's...  Every night, just about, right?  It's sad.  Guaranteed to see that.  You're always hearing that.  I think it would look something like this.  I'm going to turn around. 
[02:24:30]  All right, all right.  We get it.  We get it.  It's Arnold, right?  In a weird situation.  Give me a...  Somebody out there, give me a workplace.  Some kind of occupation.  An accountant.  Accountant.  Arnold Schwarzenegger, as an accountant, would look something like this.  Ah, your money, are you getting a good tax return this year?  Thank you.  That's what it is.  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. 
[02:25:00]  Those are never funny.  No, I'm...  Never good.  Are you a fan when they combine the impressions?  Yeah, it's...  Like if someone had a kid with someone...  Yes.  It would look like this.  Jack Nicholson.  Thank you, yeah.  Had a cross between fucked so-and-so, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm a fan of that.  I don't know.  You like that?  I'm a fan of that.  Do you fall for that?  Do you?  That's what people open up with.  I see guys...  What the fuck is that about?  I'm trying to think...  Let's try to do one for Opie. 
[02:25:30]  I'm a fan of that.  Who would Opie be?  Hey, could you do this?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm trying to think of like...  Well, we've done Popeye lately.  Oh, Abbott.  Abbott and Costello.  Arnold.  Andrew Dice Clay.  Yeah, I'm thinking...  Mel Gibson.  You'd do a pretty good Mel Gibson.  Wait, wait.  Hold on.  We'll do...  All right.  Because it's got to be like just...  Yeah.  All right.  And Mel Gibson in the news.  Wow.  He's in a little bit of trouble.  I was just thinking if Mel Gibson...  Uh...  And Ronald Reagan...  Had a baby... 
[02:26:00]  Oops.  It might sound something like this.  Nancy, you're a cunt.  You know?  Yes.  Why don't you suck my cock?  Mr. Gorbachev, lick my balls.  Thank you.  Thank you, Liz.  Thank you. 
[02:26:30]  Thank you.  Oh, thank you.  Oh, God.  I just want to fucking throw something at the stage.  I'm a fan of that.  Whenever you see someone doing that.  Let me...  When they stop pointing to the audio...  Give me a...  Give me a...  No, no, no.  That's a...  Oh, that's a good one.  Oh, that's funny.  Yeah.  An asbestos plant worker.  Pays to buy the best.  Hey, I got breakfast here. 
[02:27:00]  Can we take a break?  What?  We can play the Christian Bale-Mel Gibson remix as we go through.  That was a good one.  Colin Cain on Twitter.  And Colin Cain's playing a show in Boston.  West End Johnny's this Saturday night.  In Portland Street, Boston, Massachusetts.  Yeah, I'm getting...  You get tickets at ColinCain.com right now.  I'm looking to pack it up and have a killer show.  Right on, man.  We'll do this.  You're being a pain in the ass.  Don't be that.  Thank you.  Keep very still and listen. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah, this is the O.P. and Anthony Show on the virus.  Sirius XM.  Went old school for everybody.  God, I forgot about that one.  Remember that one?  I want to make you laugh because it's so fucking stupid.  It really is stupid.  My favorite part is the background singer.  Sounded like Arnold, too?  Yeah, yeah.  Of course.  Why wouldn't they?  Coke Logic writing, holy shit, old school.  Yeah.  Coke Logic, I want you to animate that fucking Popeye bit that Anthony did.  Oh, my God.  It's time for a Coke Logic animation.  I think the passion of the Popeye will be a big hit for everybody out there in Radioland. 
[02:28:00]  So get to it.  Chop, chop.  Wow.  Colin Cain in studio.  Very funny comic.  Absolutely.  Becoming a friend of the show right in front of our eyes.  And we like bringing new guys aboard.  It's been a while.  Good to be here.  Greg Hill is celebrating his 20th year on AAF up there in Massachusetts.  Why would you celebrate being stuck in one market for 20 fucking years? 
[02:28:30]  Wow.  Well, Godspeed.  He's a one market sensation, Colin Cain.  Yeah.  I guess if that's what you want to be, then good for you.  Yeah, I'm jealous.  You're right.  Are you?  You still want to be hanging out just in the Worcester area?  Go fuck your mother.  As soon as you make it to the border, no one knows who you are.  Suck my fucking cock.  Yeah, the second you're in fucking Rhode Island.  That used to frustrate the fuck out of me.  Anthony and I were huge in Boston radio. 
[02:29:00]  But then you would drive home.  I know a game of shit.  You were just signings with thousands of people for a DVD or a CD.  Just fucking like...  Rock stars.  Malls.  Lines that were around the fucking mall security.  And then the second you cross, welcome to Connecticut.  You're just like, hey, who the fuck are you?  That's it.  It is.  What a drop off.  We once did a 10 hour signing for a CD we put out.  Wow.  Yeah.  Where we walked into the mall and we're so stupid and clueless.  We see this long line and we're thinking it's some kind of boy band or something. 
[02:29:30]  Although, the people on the line should have been the first clue.  Yeah, exactly.  I go to Ant.  I remember.  It was yesterday.  I'm like, wow, look at all these people.  I wonder who they're here to see.  And we're going to the front of the line to try to see who is there.  You shmucks get on the line.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, yeah, let's check this out.  And then as we're making our way to the front of the line, we're like...  Holy shit.  This is for us.  It's like, get the fuck out of here.  There's too many people.  Then as soon as you like Ant said, then you go to Connecticut and reality.  Everybody sets in. 
[02:30:00]  You're just a one market douche.  We'd come back home to see our families and stuff like that to New York.  Yeah.  And it's just like...  I actually had one person go, you know, it's fishing off of Montauk one day and I heard  your show.  It's like, great.  I need...  Fucking Quint has to take out on the Orca to hear my fucking show.  Sucked.  See, because radio travels further.  Over water.  Over the water.  So if you happen to be on a boat, you got to hear us back on Long Island.  Yes.  We're broadcasting in Boston. 
[02:30:30]  Don't forget your radio, chiefie.  So that douchebag is doing 20 years.  20 years.  So they're going to let him out now or what?  Did he do his 20?  No.  No, I think he's in for life.  Which guy is exactly...  I'm confused.  No parole.  He's a douchebag.  We worked with him at AAF.  Greg Hill.  Greg Hill.  The Hill Man.  What did he do?  He does the morning show up there in...  Is he a radio personality?  AAF.  Yeah.  And he just celebrated 20 years?  20 years at the same station.  Okay.  And there's a reason why I think he's a complete douchebag.  When me and Ann got fired for saying the mayor of Boston died in a fiery car accident. 
[02:31:00]  Obviously, we should have been fired.  I understand that.  But only a few people came to bat and said, this is outrageous.  We've got to try to save these guys.  What can we do?  And one of those guys was fucking John Osterlin.  The Ozone.  The Ozone.  It's the best.  And this Greg Hill kept his fucking mouth shut.  Didn't say a goddamn word.  Rock Hull.  Not a one.  Rock Hull took our job.  Right.  Rock Hull just sat in our fucking seat.  It's the Rocko show now.  Yeah, I'm in afternoon drive, dude.  He couldn't wait. 
[02:31:30]  He fucking sat that fat ass down in our seats.  Both of them.  It was great.  He had to push them together.  One per cheek.  Yeah, this business sucks.  And then the Hill Man was just like we were never at the station.  Like we never were there.  And you know what?  If you agreed with the decision, then say that even.  But he didn't have an opinion either way.  How was he to you guys up until that point?  Before the happy.  A douchebag.  Phony.  Fake.  Yeah, because we were way more popular than him. 
[02:32:00]  And he couldn't handle that because he was already at the station for a few years.  That's good.  What's he going to do?  Have a call in?  Well, Greg, happy 20th.  Thank you, Cam Neely, for calling in on my 20th anniversary.  Hi, Greg.  How are you doing?  Yeah.  Thank you, random Massachusetts politician that I've kissed ass for 20 years. 
[02:32:30]  Sports figure that I've blown for 20 years.  Oh, what a nothing, nothing substance ass.  Good for him.  Yeah, fuck him.  I guess Thursday is really an angry day.  Yeah, we learned that on Twitter.  Thursday is the angriest day of the week.  Bed bugs.  Fuck, I hate bed bugs.  You fucking savages.  Don't stay in our hotels.  Do you think normal, God-fearing American people are bringing bed bugs to hotels in New York City? 
[02:33:00]  Or is it this fucking greasy French people coming over with their bugs?  You're blaming the French on this one?  Under their berets and in their bags with the baguettes sticking out of the top.  Who the fuck gets that?  Those are big.  You know when I was just a fucking really, really poor fucking asshole, I didn't get bed bugs.  It says bed bug infestation.  Infestation. Infestation in public places is becoming more common.  It's because of the fucking international, like there's more people traveling, more people coming into this country from other lands than ever before. 
[02:33:30]  And they're just, they're fucking, they bring bugs.  It still doesn't make sense.  I used to get my mattresses from the side of the road and I never had bugs.  Well, it probably died on the road.  The heat and the rain.  Nah, you'd think they would live in that environment, actually.  With the worms underneath it?  Just wipe it off?  They got those dogs that sniff them out.  You seen those?  Yeah, what's that about?  Really?  Just like a little-  Bed bug dogs?  No, they have a, and they have a name for the dog. 
[02:34:00]  They call them some wacky name and then the dog comes by and goes, yep, you have bed bugs.  Oh, really?  Sniffs around and finds them for you.  Yeah.  You got bed bugs.  They train the dog to find the bed bugs.  You know what also clued me in?  That we got this weird fucking thing going on with foreign people.  I don't mind your good, clean foreigner.  You want to come here in Times Square and see the naked cow, girl?  No, you mind.  You're just trying to be nice.  I do.  I actually do.  I hate them all.  Is there's a commercial on that there's no fucking reason to have this commercial on.  It's this, she sounds Asian, like probably Southeast Asian, and she's like, I had the 
[02:34:30]  dengue fever.  The pain in my joints from the dengue fever.  And I'm like, what the fuck is dengue fever?  And then the guy announces like, dengue fever is a disease from developing nations.  And it's starting to be seen here.  And there's research into dengue fever.  I'm like, why is there a commercial for a fucking disease that should not be in this 
[02:35:00]  country?  We should be able to keep the dengue fever out of America.  I was in the hospital with the dengue fever for three months.  It felt like my joints were burning on fire.  Dengue fever.  Shit, I get a cold.  Take some fucking NyQuil for your dengue fever.  I'm not going outside anymore.  Never.  I stay in the compound.  I think you're onto something by not leaving your house.  Constantly.  Ed the Exterminator is on the line.  God damn, it's been a while.  Hey, Ed, how are you, sir?  Morning, boys. 
[02:35:30]  Good morning.  I got a nice little story for you.  Do you?  Oh, yes, if you let me tell you.  All right.  Whoa.  I just told you, Anthony.  Well, there's this lady, man.  Literally.  A lady, man.  A house of bedbugs on her couch where she slept.  Her head on the couch where she slept.  It grew into her ear.  We picked up her pillow.  Yeah.  We picked up her pillow.  They were moving broad daylight.  These things are nocturnal.  Thousands of bedbugs. 
[02:36:00]  Heebie-jeebies.  Yeah.  And as far as Anthony, who's bringing them in, your favorite people, it's actually Indians.  They have that game over India like you wouldn't believe.  Oh, big time, dude.  Oh, Captain.  It was Khan.  He put creatures in our bodies.  If the Indians, they're the ones who that they can't kill them, right?  They have to sweep before they walk.  Is that what they do?  Is that it?  They have to sweep.  Yeah, yeah.  Don't fucking step on them because it might be your cousin. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  I don't know.  They're infested with rats.  They're infested with rats because they don't kill them because they worship them.  So the rats actually travel, take them from, you know.  All right.  Let's slow down.  I know the Indians worship the cow.  They also worship the rat.  Look it up on YouTube.  They actually have.  Oh, well.  It's got to be true, then.  It's on YouTube.  It's got to be true.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  Is it on Wikipedia, though?  Because that's the all end all.  Only if Fred said it to you at a party.  I love how people are going to put credence in anything on the Internet now.  Look it up on YouTube. 
[02:37:00]  They fucking Googled it.  Dude, it was like daylight.  It was like thousands on a fucking pillow.  It was amazing.  Bed bugs.  Ed?  Yeah.  Yeah, dude.  Look it up on YouTube.  All right.  Well, look it up on the YouTube.  I'm going to end every sentence today with look it up on YouTube.  On the YouTube.  On the YouTube.  The YouTube.  Are you doing the marijuana?  Exactly.  All right.  We're going to look it up on the YouTube, Ed.  Yeah.  All right.  Thanks, you.  And I want to know if Indians worship the rat. 
[02:37:30]  Speaking of Indians, like Arabs and Indians, I always feel every time I play lotto, I don't  know if you guys play lotto, but I play lotto because I think, you know, I just.  You need the money.  Yeah.  Would be nice, right?  Yeah.  Sure.  The only white guy who plays lotto.  So I go to lotto and I always go in and it's always some Arab guy, just me and him in  the store.  And it's always like, I feel like it's some terrorist thing.  It's just me and him.  I'm like, can I get a dollar quick?  Making a deal.  And then he looks at me, he looks around real quiet.  He's like, doo, doo, doo.  And he gives it.  He goes, good luck.  Good luck.  Good luck.  It's the only time like an Arab guy says good luck to you.  Yeah.  What else do you hear?  Never.  Seriously.  It's just one of those.  Good luck. 
[02:38:00]  You never really have a.  You're going to need it.  I don't agree.  What do you mean?  Nothing.  Just a little, right?  You don't have interactions with the Arabs.  You're right.  For the most part.  I'm usually very cordial in the convenience store and stuff.  And there's one by my house that I usually go to if I need a quick, you know, eight pack  or fucking 12 pack or something like that.  Eight pack?  Yeah.  The old days.  The old eight pack.  I'll buy 12 packs.  I know.  I got kegs in my house now, so I haven't been there in a while. 
[02:38:30]  But when I would go in there, I would be cordial and be like, all right, well, thank  you.  And he would just nod his head at me.  Like, he wouldn't talk.  No.  There's no communication.  But you see that all over the world.  I mean, what pisses me off the worst, I try to be friendly when I go up and I say, I  go to the counter, hi, how are you?  And I don't say anything.  I turn on them right away.  And then I'm an asshole to them.  If I say, hi, how are you?  And then they just stare at you.  Yeah, I guess they know that they're just hated.  So if you're saying, hey, how you doing? 
[02:39:00]  They probably expect a robbery.  You know, he's trying to distract me.  Right.  Hello.  I'm now on my guard.  The guy always, too, when you go to, like, those crappy bodegas, whatever, and they give  them money, and then he's always afraid to touch your hands.  You know what I'm talking about?  Like, he drops, he puts, like, the coins.  It's like, yeah, what are you afraid to touch my hands for, motherfucker?  Yeah, I don't wipe my fucking ass with my raw hands.  We've all heard that.  That's right.  He's a deadly...  Looking up on the YouTube.  It's happening.  He's afraid to touch my hands, but he's, you know, handling me like finger-fucking a cat 
[02:39:30]  behind the counter for, like, three hours.  And I'm the dirty one.  Right.  Yeah.  You're filthy American.  If you notice that, that's what they do.  They don't even clean.  You ever seen the stuff in the front of a bodega?  Like, how the sun gets to it?  Yeah, yeah.  Things in the front?  The stuff's stored in the front window.  And the dust, that's just the fucking stack of dust on the canned goods that are puffing  out like dirigibles.  When they go in, you say, can I use the bathroom?  I remember one time when I went out to go to the bathroom, so bad.  It was one of those, I call it the Puerto Rican Day Parade shit, because it happens once 
[02:40:00]  a year and it's out of control.  You know, those ones where it's just...  So bad, we actually think about buying pants.  You know, like, you actually...  You start to be like, you know what, I think there's a gap on 53rd, you know?  Yeah, these are done.  Have you ever had it so bad, you had to ditch underwear in a bathroom?  Uh, no.  But, yeah, I got some stores.  Yeah, so I got it.  Commando.  No, no.  No, but, um...  Just the, you know, he's always like, uh...  You gotta eat customers for only.  You know, restrooms for customers only. 
[02:40:30]  So it's like, dude, I've been here before.  It's like the daily, like, I'm a customer.  So he's like, is it an emergency?  It's like, dude, I'm asking to use...  It's just a stupid bathroom.  But he goes to me, is it an emergency?  It's like, dude, I'm in a bodega asking to use the toilet.  What do you think?  What do you think, dude?  And don't I have, like, rollover piss minutes?  There's gotta be...  Because I didn't piss every time I bought something in here?  That's what I want to do, you know?  Why do they look at the bathrooms like they're so valuable?  Well, there's a rule to it.  It's so stupid.  I mean, if you serve, what, food and drink, you gotta have...  It's just law, right?  You gotta put a bodega, I guess.  Yeah, yeah, bodega thing.  I love knowing that it's a law, and you go into one of these places where, obviously, 
[02:41:00]  there's no bathroom in sight, but you know they have to let you use their bathroom,  and then you go walking through the fucking hallways in the back of the store to their  private bathroom.  There's a guy just fucking welding shit and soldering bombs together.  Just, like, looking at him.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, what's going on?  Yeah.  That's fantastic, Grant.  We're the best, yeah, that's...  We got a bed bug story from John in Jersey.  What?  John!  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Well, one thing is that, actually, bed bugs go dormant for 18 months without feeding and 
[02:41:30]  still stay alive.  They can stay alive for 18 months without eating anything?  Without eating.  They actually go dormant.  And the reason, oh, you never actually got bed bugs when you were poor and all that crap  is because pesticides got worse.  Pesticides were so good back in the evening.  Because you never hooked up with it.  They take the shit out of them.  They actually knocked them all out.  What happened?  He enjoyed it.  What?  It's another call that just enjoyed the story.  I didn't hear what you said.  Oh, I said pesticides were so good back then. 
[02:42:00]  Pesticides.  He's talking pesticides, I think.  What?  The pesticides aren't as good now.  Yeah, I guess, you know, the EPA fucking throws all their rules on it.  The hours are cutting up with it.  Yeah, Colin, you like the foreigners?  Colin Kane's like a...  Like, you're a New York guy, man.  You do the subways and the bodegas and you play the lotto and...  Yeah, this is my home, so...  What do you like about New York?  Well, what do you hate about New York, actually?  I hate about New York.  I hate...  Everybody's miserable sometimes. 
[02:42:30]  Everybody, you know, everyone here's trying to make it.  So when you make it, you're focusing on yourself and you're not that open and stuff.  Therefore, you get to be that way.  It's a very lonely city.  Remember how nice everyone was after 9-11, though, for a little while?  That lasted two days.  September 23rd, just you're opening the door by yourself.  Yeah.  It was...  You know how many people...  And I'm a fucking asshole.  You know how many people I waved in front of me on the road, like when they're merging traffic?  And I'd just be like, hey, go ahead. 
[02:43:00]  After you.  I'd let, like, two cars go, and they'd wave, like, thank you.  American flags are on the cars.  And everyone was all nice to everybody.  You know, people opening doors, like, looking at each other and saying, hi, good morning.  People you don't know.  Because we all had this thing in common.  We all went through some shit.  Yeah.  And then...  We were all terrified.  Two weeks later, it's like, hey, fucking dick.  Pedestrian shithead.  It said, don't walk.  I'm driving.  You're fucking in the crosswalk.  Next thing you know, you're yelling, you should have been in the building! 
[02:43:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  You should only have been in building two!  That's, yeah.  It kind of turned a little bit.  It does, because you know how to say hi to people in your building.  They look at you like, what?  You ever just say hi to somebody?  And they're like, what are you, you know?  You're going to rob me?  I hold the door for the guy in my building every day.  It's the least thing I do, because I'm stealing his fucking wireless internet signal.  So I just do that.  That's what I do.  I say back.  That's nice.  My signal, my kitchen, I get two bars. 
[02:44:00]  I literally move like two inches to like, you know, my room.  It's like three bars.  So like two inches is going to determine if I, you know, nut or not.  Yeah, yeah.  I feel like a chick all of a sudden.  Fucking great point.  So you know, Opie, my fire skate, five bars.  And there's been times where I just want to just bang one out on the fire skate.  Five bars on my fire skate.  Oh, shit.  Five bars.  Damn.  That's not an air conditioning drip, I'll tell you that.  Right.  Yeah.  And you are getting full motion video out there.  No buffering.  You make a great point.  I'm in a high rise for, I guess I just, wow, I think three years now. 
[02:44:30]  And I'm in the elevator with the same fucking people.  I'm like, really?  After three years, we're going to still make believe we don't know each other?  How about a quick fucking high?  Yep.  Nothing worse than having your dick in your hand and the video has to buffer.  Yeah.  You're like, now you just feel silly.  The worst thing about that, Opie, you'll agree, too, is when you download a clip to your laptop,  it doesn't start out, and it just gives you just enough time to realize how fucking sad  you are.  Just sitting there. 
[02:45:00]  And you actually pause for a little, and you just wait there.  We're so sick.  You ever just get lost in that world of pornography?  I'm talking like 20 windows deep.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Close them all.  20 windows deep.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Yeah, click.  Click.  This one's good.  New windows are opening up.  And then it leads to, you know, the big moment for you.  Yep.  I mean, also, you know what?  I think I could go back to that other scene, and the next thing you know, you're fucking  having your orgasm, and then everyone's fully clothed, and nothing's happening.  I just wasted that one. 
[02:45:30]  I'm from the school of, yeah, yeah, that's it.  Nah, I can find something better.  Nah.  I can find, you know something?  It's like a game show.  Are you going to come to this photo, or would you like to go on to the next page and see  if a better girl is there?  I'm going to go on.  Next page.  You just get tangled up.  Next page.  I mean, it's great, these categorized searches that they got, too.  It's convenient for us when you go A through Z.  You got, you know, like big butts. 
[02:46:00]  You got B.  I love under W.  They have a section for whores, because I don't know where I'd find one on that site.  Yeah, what the fuck?  Look at it.  Every site.  Doesn't that cover everything?  They got W.  They have a section for whores.  I guess the chick with the bowling pin in her ass isn't a whore.  Yeah.  Where are we going to, you know, just peg her?  And then we went through this phase, like with the internet, when people first started  using the internet, a lot of people.  You download a picture, it would take forever.  But it was the greatest thing.  You're now getting porn and nudity.  And then there was nothing for free. 
[02:46:30]  Nothing.  If you got a thumbnail, you used to have to jerk off to thumbnails.  You had to work thumbnails.  Because everything was put your credit card in.  And now we've gotten this new renaissance where the most hardcore fucking full motion video,  HD, is fucking free.  Email to you every morning.  It's beautiful.  Look at these fucking pictures.  My new favorites are just amateur sexting shots and the mirror pictures, where chicks 
[02:47:00]  are taking the pictures in the mirror.  That, to me, is so hot.  They're regular girls.  They're just fucking...  Oh, well, I like a fucking girl taking a good cum shot, too, with the braces on.  That was a nice one.  That was Sandy.  Jesus Christ.  That was Sandy.  Come on, guys.  Don't come on my face.  I joined a porn site a couple of my life.  And one time I joined one and they had a security question, you know, in case you forget your  password.  I shit you not.  What is your mother's maiden name?  Oh.  I really didn't feel like jerking off. 
[02:47:30]  I'll take it right out of it.  You know what?  You just turned off the computer and went outside.  I just played Frisbee.  I forgot about it entirely.  The fact that I just said I played Frisbee, too, was just awful.  Jake, you're right the fuck out of it.  But luckily, I knew the backup question, which was, what color are my grandma's spider veins?  So I was good to go.  Seriously, that's the security question.  Come on.  What kind of cock block is that?  What is your mother's maiden name?  You don't have to think about your mother.  Dude, come on, right?  Oh, okay.  Jimmy Sal from Vermont, to add to this conversation, blow load, close 31 windows. 
[02:48:00]  That's great.  Blow load, close 31 windows.  I want that on his tombstone.  That's funny, brother.  You're like, holy shit, I open up a lot of windows.  You know what makes me laugh, too, is just the difference between guys and girls when  we shoot the shit about fucking.  It's great.  Especially my friend.  I was hooking up with this chick, and I was telling this guy and a girl, and she's like,  oh, you know, you're wearing condoms.  And my friend goes, where do you drop loads?  Just the difference. 
[02:48:30]  Where do you drop loads?  That's exactly what it was.  It made me laugh.  Someone's saying my favorite is tweet me some skin on Twitter.  It's all right.  It gets the job done.  You follow Tweet Me Some Skin?  She pushes naked chicks.  Yeah, it's kind of the sexting pics.  Here it comes.  Oh, boy.  She's got glasses on.  This can't end well.  Yeah, this is going to end.  She's one of those, like, fake braces girl, though.  Come on.  You take it.  She's reconsidering everything at this point. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah, she's really thinking that she should have stayed in school.  I want to see you play with your tits.  Play with what tits?  Look at those things.  What the fuck?  I want you to touch your clavicle.  I want you to play with your pecs.  Right?  She's waiting for her.  It's not about you, douchebag.  Let's go.  Oh, she's just like...  Keep those glasses on.  She adjusts the glasses.  Those are safety goggles.  She doesn't look like she's...  Recreational spectacles. 
[02:49:30]  Oh, wow.  I missed it.  No.  Oh, it was glare.  Yeah, I saw it.  Was that just...  I thought this big fucking...  What was that, three men and a baby when you see the ghost in the background?  Is that the ghost nut?  The guy's cleaning her glasses.  Really nice.  Anthony, I saw that ghost nut, too.  There was a ghost nut.  Yeah, I saw that ghost nut.  Yeah.  Well, that's cool.  Now she looks like she's wearing x-ray specs.  Oh, that's great.  The guy...  The guy...  He laid it out very...  He's a drooler.  Yeah.  He's kind of drooled out. 
[02:50:00]  Oh, shit.  Yeah, that's...  Yeah, yeah.  Well, there you go.  Nice cum show.  We were just watching...  Oh, ladies and gentlemen that are listening to our radio show, sorry.  What happened?  We were just watching pornography while you were just kind of hanging out.  You should have played along at home.  You always notice when you open up the porn windows, they always have that one pop-up,  and it's supposedly a girl in her room, and you can tell her to do...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, I love doing those, too.  I don't know if you ever just mess around with it.  I just kind of like, oh, yeah, no, touch your tits, you touch your tits, and she's supposedly  in her room like, all right, go in your closet and get your graduation gown. 
[02:50:30]  You just kind of see just...  Yeah, that's when you realize it's a loop.  Let me say hi to Mike in Jersey.  Is he Mike?  Hey, guys.  Hey, Mike.  My wallpaper on my computer is a picture of my wife and my daughter, and when I get on  the computer, I forget about it, and then I go on the internet, start searching porn,  turn the scrap, and I close all the windows quick, and I'm sitting there fucking with my  pants down on my knees, and there's a picture of my wife and daughter looking back at me.  Yeah, from your Disney trip or something. 
[02:51:00]  That's great.  Yeah.  So why do you have to go to porn pages?  Jesus Christ.  Holy shit.  Well, I was kind of implying that he would jerk off to...  What else is going on in the world?  Oh, your buddy John Sterling had a home run call.  Oh, yeah.  New guy, new home run call.  We love these.  You know what I don't like about Sterling?  Are you a baseball fan, Colin King?  No, UFC fan, but that's the only sport I really follow. 
[02:51:30]  You know what I don't like about Sterling?  Well, there's a few things, but I don't like the fact that he calls former Yankee home runs.  Like, the Yankees are playing the Angels, and Hideki Matsui gets up there and fucking,  you know, slams a home run, and he does the, you know, Godzilla fucking thing.  Really?  A thriller from Godzilla.  Because he misses saying it?  Because he's not a Yankee anymore?  Yeah, yeah.  I didn't know he was doing that.  It's like, you know what?  Just drop the fucking thing.  Hey, admit it high, admit it far, it is gone. 
[02:52:00]  A home run by Hideki Matsui.  All right.  Fuck you.  You don't have to throw in the Godzilla thing.  Right.  I didn't know he did that.  Because it's all about him.  Exactly.  Well, there's a new guy who came up and hit a homer, rookie Colin Curtis.  Colin Curtis.  This is how he called the home run last night.  Now, here's the 3-2.  Swung on and lined a deep right.  That ball is high.  It is far.  It is gone.  Oh, Colin Curtis drills a three-run home run to right to break open the game. 
[02:52:30]  I'll see you later, he said.  A three-run blast in the right field seats.  And the Yankees now take a 10-5 lead.  Colin Curtis.  Get it?  I'll see you later.  Wow, he's got to work on that one.  He really does need something else, yeah.  He wasn't expecting him to hit a homer.  No, no.  He's like, fuck, I've got to pull something out of my ass.  See, he can't pull shit out of his ass.  All right.  That was bad.  He stinks.  Danny, I finally saw the video of the father yelling while her... 
[02:53:00]  Oh, that's a great one.  You've seen it too, Colin K?  Yeah, of course.  Have you seen it?  I don't know the backstory.  It almost seems like it's fake.  No, it's not.  I needed to know why this video was getting so much attention, so I kind of looked at  it, and apparently some girl was on some...  I mean, everybody knows of the infamous message board 4chan, where a lot of weird shit goes  down.  So, apparently, she was on there.  There were people that were flaming her and just making fun of her, because she was trying 
[02:53:30]  to be this look-at-me, look-at-me person.  And then, so, she was just getting her ass handed to her, to the point where I think people  were harassing her.  They found her address.  They found her phone number.  They were giving her shit in real life.  And then, you know, she kind of had a breakdown, and then her father had to get involved a  little bit.  Wow.  And got online?  And got on a...  I don't know if it was a recording or live or whatever, but she's...  I think it was a live video chat thing, and he kind of just gets into it.  Yeah, I saw the video.  He's in the background yelling and screaming at everybody.  But were they screen capping her videos, because they were so ridiculous? 
[02:54:00]  What do you mean?  Before the father got involved?  Because there's other videos of her online.  Yeah, I don't know.  I know her YouTube account was taken down.  I forget what her name was.  But, uh...  All right.  This is amazing.  Have you seen his aunt?  No!  So she's hysterical.  She's crying her eyes out.  She can't be more than, what, 15, maybe?  She's probably younger than that.  Even younger than 15.  What?  And then the father's in the background just yelling and screaming into the camp.  Is that it?  Want to play it off that so we can see the visual?  I'm going to find a thousand remixes and things that... 
[02:54:30]  You know what I'm saying?  I hate that shit.  All right.  We'll play it here, then?  Yeah.  Here's just the audience.  Pop on up, though, so I can get kind of a visual, because...  Oh.  Let's see what the guy...  That might be the one right there.  Okay, you guys...  Yeah, this is it.  This is Jesse Slater, and I just wanted to say that you guys have ruined my life.  I'm going to tell you right now.  This is from her father.  You bunch of lying, no-good punks, and I know who it's coming from, because I back-traced  it, and I know who's emailing and who's doing it, and you'll be reported to the cyber police 
[02:55:00]  and the state police.  So you better write one more thing, or screw with my computer again, you'll be arrested.  End of conversation from her father.  You're right, it's fucking going to come and beat her ass.  What?  Hold on, pause this, motherfucker.  A couple things going on.  Yeah, there's a couple of problems here.  First of all, why don't you be a parent and turn off her fucking computer?  End of story.  Why are you letting a kid that age wear fucking a top where you could see her little training 
[02:55:30]  bra?  As hot as it is, I mean, you do some parenting.  And the guy's not savvy.  I mean, call me crazy, but I don't think this is going to stop us.  Looks like a wrestler doing mic work, though, didn't it?  Let me tell you, brother!  That's exactly what I thought right away.  Right away.  Right away.  I don't think they're going to stop, man.  What do you think?  Yeah, they're going to go, yes, sir.  Sorry about that, sir.  Well, she ended up after...  Why don't you fuck her? 
[02:56:00]  Why don't you just fuck her, asshole?  After this video got big and started making the rounds, she was getting death threats, apparently.  So, like, I think she had to actually be put under, like, police custody.  Holy shit.  Really?  She got death threats?  Back up the video a little bit.  She should be removed from the fucking house.  And let me go to Zach in Boston, who says he has more info.  We'll see.  Zach, you got more info on this?  Yeah.  Her name is Jessie Slaughter.  If you look up, I believe it's called Encyclopedia Dramatica, Jessie Slaughter. 
[02:56:30]  I guess they were sending death threats, hundreds of pizzas to her house.  They were sending...  Hundreds of pizzas.  That old gang.  But how did this get to this point?  Because the kids on the message board added her on MySpace, hacked her account, got her  home address, her phone number.  It's ridiculous.  But why her?  Why are they doing it to her?  Well, because she's a little girl on the internet talking shit.  Well, what did she say?  And she thought she was...  You've seen the videos, I mean.  Oh, I didn't.  I'm sorry. 
[02:57:00]  All right.  So I sort of guessed.  So she was talking a lot of shit, and then people just said, you know what?  She's a little 11-year-old girl.  I thought she could say whatever she wanted on the internet.  She's an 11-year-old girl.  And these trolls on the internet banded together and got back at her, I guess.  Right.  Okay.  Tell me.  Can we go back to that video?  Thank you, sir.  Yeah, if you want the backstory.  It says here, she was already, before this video, an unfortunate micro-celebrity among  internet teen...  Excuse me.  Internet tween scenesters. 
[02:57:30]  Apparently, she was linked somehow to this lead singer of a band or whatever, but she wasn't.  And so there was just this weird going back and forth drama thing, and then I guess she  was just getting made fun of and stuff.  And then this video.  So, yeah, let's go back to the video.  Better again, you'll be arrested.  End of conversation from her father.  You're right.  You're going to come and feed her ass.  And if you come near my daughter, guess what? 
[02:58:00]  Consequences will never be the same.  You lying bunch of pritch.  See, my house has been like this.  I mean, since everybody's been posting stuff about me, okay?  My...  I am personally torn...  I live in PC.  I am torn.  I am literally...  I am having emotional breakdowns one after another.  For the past, like, three days.  You can't sleep.  You can't eat. 
[02:58:30]  Because you're going to fuck.  You guys are just basically tearing me apart right now.  I'm crying my eyes out.  If you haven't done it...  I want the family dog just to take a shit on the floor behind her and just walk out of the frame.  I'm just kidding.  You're just ruining my fucking life.  Why doesn't the mother just turn off her fucking camera?  Just throw her computer away.  Exactly.  Un-fucking-believable.  Un-fucking-believable. 
[02:59:00]  By your father!  You'll fucking suck my cock!  It's just great, yeah, how just technology, obviously, this day and age, YouTube and videos and everything,  and then the dad just being so old school like that.  Just coming in and being like...  I back-traced it.  Yeah.  I back-traced it.  No one uses that.  Back-traced.  Yes, he back-traced it.  Back-traced it.  Back-tracked, you monkey.  All right, there you're fucking...  A back-traced.  Fucking Jack Bauer, motherfucker.  He back-traced it.  You know what I was saying? 
[02:59:30]  Oh, but you know, I'm always sharing videos with you and vice versa.  For me, YouTube videos, they make me laugh more than sitcoms sometimes.  Yeah, not even sometimes.  It's such a deep laugh that it's just...  It really...  It's the best shit for me.  Which one are you digging?  Lately?  Yeah, I'm doing a thing with Colin Kaney.  He gives me a video every week that I retweet.  The one you did with the...  We should play for Ant, the male cheerleader, was fucking ridiculous.  That was a good one.  We retweeted that last week.  That was a good one.  How did we find that?  There's one recently that I... 
[03:00:00]  Oh, you got a new one?  Yeah, yeah.  I have a new one for the...  Of course, for this week, I have one for you.  Where's the one from last week for Anthony?  This is so fucking uncomfortable to watch.  Yeah, that's it right there.  This is our internet segment, ladies and gentlemen.  Our internet segment.  It's a remix.  Yeah, you need the original.  I know you have it.  I'm done with the remix.  That's kind of a meat spin with his head remix.  Right.  Meat spin?  Love meat spin.  You haven't seen meat spin?  No.  Then you don't know shit about the internet.  The simple things are sometimes the best. 
[03:00:30]  Look at this, Anthony.  Look at this guy.  Look at this dedication.  Look at this dedication.  Oh, my God.  Is he really dedicated?  He's the only guy.  He's the only guy.  He's among very hot cheerleaders.  He's a big lug, and he is doing all the moves.  That's not even the full video.  Whatever.  Wow, is he gay.  Go to meat spin?  You want to see meat spin?  Yeah, I want to show you.  I can give it to you now.  Let me see.  Show meat spin.  Yeah, I'd love to see that.  Would you?  I'm sure you would.  I didn't know. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah, please.  Can we go to break?  You sure you want to see meat spin?  Yeah.  All right.  Okay.  Let's get that up for you.  What the fuck is meat spin?  Let's go to meat spin first, eh?  And then we'll go to your video.  Because you really want to see meat spin.  Well, fuck.  Ask and you will receive.  Yes.  I don't want to hear receive after I said I want to see meat spin.  True.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  This could be a bad day for the internet, Anthony.  I don't think we could get to meat spin.  No, I'll get it.  I don't know why it's just enough.  While he's looking that up, there's already a downfall video about that Jesse Slaughter 
[03:01:30]  girl that Hitler's getting in trouble, and her father sent the cyber police after Hitler  for posting comments on her video.  Those Hitler videos never get old.  I know.  Did you see the one about the double rainbow?  Yeah, yeah.  Double rainbow.  Yeah.  Double rainbow.  Hitler video's pretty good.  When he starts taking those glasses off, you know the shit's hitting the fan.  Did you guys check out Winnebago Man, the documentary?  Yeah.  That's one of my favorite things.  Did you see the documentary?  No.  Just came out in the theaters.  They did a documentary about the guy.  No.  Really?  Yeah.  So I want to came out. 
[03:02:00]  Is it actually in the weird artsy theaters?  Yep.  And they went.  And actually, it's pretty cool.  Uh-oh.  It's not coming out.  Oh, you guys crashed Meat Spin.  How are we crashing Meat Spin?  You fucking crashed Meat Spin.  It's like the...  Fuck you assholes.  Let us go to Meat Spin.  I just want you to know that it started with lines at the mall, and you just crashed the  internet right there.  That's right.  All right?  So that's O&A right there.  We're not a one-market sensation.  No, it's not.  We're not at...  What's that?  What's that?  All right.  Turn us on to that other video.  Maybe we can get Meat Spin for you, because I know you really want to see it there, Colin. 
[03:02:30]  Can you pull up YouTube for me?  Is it slow?  Yeah.  The internet.  The inner tubes are a little full today.  Oh.  They're a little full.  How can you not get Meat Spin?  Danny, do you know this one?  Because someone's yelling and saying Meat Spin is old, and this is the new one.  Yeah, everybody's got one that's better, right?  That's better, but you know what?  Nothing beats the Meat Spin.  But that's why I go to you, Danny, because you know...  You spin me right round, baby, right?  Yeah, I think I know what that one is. 
[03:03:00]  I'm pretty sure.  I think that's...  I think we've seen it before.  I think that's finger in the old cock hole.  Oh, God damn it.  No.  Is it like a Meat Spin?  It just goes over and over again?  Yeah, that's the...  Finger slam.  That's the internet thing to do.  Finger slam, Anthony.  Because what says funny by doing it over and over again?  Yes.  Exactly.  If there's one thing the internet taught me, it's just fucking make an animated GIF of  something really funny, and it makes it funnier.  And then just keep it going and going forever and ever.  Living on, on the internet. 
[03:03:30]  All right.  Colin Kane's turning us on to something.  I'm trying to pull it off for you guys.  I don't know the exact link.  It's just...  So, give me a sec.  I'll get it for you guys.  No problem.  Yeah, it's...  You know, just a radio show.  Yeah, no big deal.  Have you guys seen the Numa Numa Kid?  The fat kid?  He's singing a crazy song.  Have you seen that?  Oh, shit.  You guys gotta check it out.  Oh, shit.  That's probably really good.  Oh, you know who's even better, too?  The guy you ever see him?  Chocolate Rain.  Is that new? 
[03:04:00]  Apparently, yeah.  Mike in Green Bay.  What's up, Mike?  Mike?  Hey, Ope.  I've been watching all your OPIs,  and I'm just wondering who that fat fuck at the end of your OPIs is.  How dare you, sir?  That's Roland.  That's Steve.  Is that really Roland?  Oh, my God.  Oh, Roland.  Roland tags all my videos now.  Oh, that's not very nice.  Thank you, Mikey.  You got it, Colin?  Yeah, give me one sec.  I think I found a few guys.  It's an older one, but it may be...  If you try to show us the Old Spice video.  You know this one?  I think so.  Oh, but you've seen this one? 
[03:04:30]  It made me laugh when I saw it.  Aprenda...  It's some...  What?  Oh, is it the flipper kid on the floor?  No, no.  That was at the compound this weekend.  Let me see.  Look at this dude.  Holy shit.  How sad is this?  What the fuck is wrong with him?  He has tits.  He has tits. 
[03:05:00]  We're looking at a Hispanic guy with tits and...  He's all distorted.  It's a workout, dude.  Steroids gone bad.  Is it steroids or you think he's got some kind of like...  No.  Implants or something.  I count...  Royds.  I count six tits.  Like his shoulders?  He's got like two bowling balls on his shoulders.  Top of his shoulders.  Then two bowling balls basically where his shoulders are going. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah.  And then two fucking bowling balls on his chest.  What a fucking freak.  Oh, that's a...  Do you think he looks in the mirror and is like, yeah, that looks good?  My favorite thing...  You know, it's obviously...  It looks like tits.  It is.  Yeah, yeah.  It's tits.  When I saw it, that's what made me laugh.  What a...  Holy shit.  That's a big time visual, but the people out there will love it.  You tweet that later.  I'll retweet it.  All right, Carl?  Yeah, I'll get that to you.  What always makes me laugh, too, is people with steroids, they always like, you know, 
[03:06:00]  I get the fucking heart of a marathon when they're like the muscles of a nightclub  bouncer.  They forget they got like the face of Randy Johnson.  They always forget the...  They always think that that's...  The downside.  The downside of steroids.  Yeah.  Yeah, fucking meth head.  That always made me laugh.  Yeah, that guy's just freaky looking with that fucking...  He's got tits.  Those aren't fucking pecs.  They're big tits.  He's proud of it, eh?  Oh, yeah, he's flexing them. 
[03:06:30]  What a gang.  What a gang.  What else we got going on?  What a gang.  Donkey parasailing on a beach in Russia.  Oh, people are so outraged at that thing, and it looked hysterical when I saw it.  Isn't it a video, too, Dan?  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  They took a fucking donkey.  I got the news story, and then we'll look at the video.  You know how horrified the donkey had to be?  They fucking took a donkey, hooked him up to a parasail, and fucking took off, and the 
[03:07:00]  donkey goes flying up in the air in a parasail.  Yeah, I saw this on the news.  And it's like, who thought this up?  Police in southern Russia are investigating a leisure firm, which forced a donkey to parasail  over the sea.  Witnesses report hearing a terrified animal braying as it flew over the sea for half an  hour before landing in the water and being dragged for several meters.  Meters.  Luckily, the donkey survived the ordeal, and police say it was being used to promote parasailing, 
[03:07:30]  adding that no one reported it happening, even though beachgoers were distressed by seeing  the donkey's suffering.  Officials are now looking at bringing animal cruelty charges, which could land the organizers,  with a two-year jail sentence.  That thing takes off at about a hundred...  That donkey does zero to a hundred in a second.  Who thought that would be a good idea?  Uh, the place.  It's probably, you know, not...  Where is it?  Russia?  Fuck.  They're crazy over there.  Flying a donkey?  Nothing better than English reporters. 
[03:08:00]  With that delivery that has to have that up-and-down thing.  The fuck is that about?  The donkey?  Hmm.  Yeah.  Well...  Poor fucking thing.  God damn, that is nasty.  Well, that's that foreign country shit.  Yeah, they don't care about animals.  When you go on vacation, they do really crazy shit, and you're like, really?  They laugh at us.  Like, does the government know you're doing this?  Is this safe?  How we take care of our animals and stuff? 
[03:08:30]  I was in Mexico recently, and I did a show there, and I was riding...  You know, they took me out to hang out and stuff, and they wanted me to ride horses.  And we could do anything with animals.  Like, it's not like...  They don't permit or anything.  And the guy is like some ten-year-old Mexican with just a bashed lip who's bleeding, and  he just hands me the strap to the horse.  Bleeding from the face.  Shit.  He just hands it to me.  He just hands me...  Like, hop on.  Honestly, there was no...  There's no permits. 
[03:09:00]  There was no, like...  It wasn't, you know, gated.  Right.  It wasn't gated.  Any insurance there, you think?  There's mopeds zipping by the horse.  We talk about this from time to time.  I went snorkeling with sharks one day, and I go, well, they must have figured this out.  And then the sharks got way too close to the surface, because they figured how cool it would  be if we get some tourists in the water, and they get to see fucking sharks.  So they take us out, and there's a feeding box on the floor of the ocean or whatever.  Yeah, I guess it would be chum.  It's about 60 feet down, so you're snorkeling on the top. 
[03:09:30]  I'm like, wow, look at the sharks.  They're eating the chum, right?  And these fuckers start circling up, and I'm thinking, oh, this has got to be safe.  They must have got, like you said, the permits and stuff.  And all of a sudden, they start yelling from the boat, get out of the fucking water.  Oh, man.  And I'm thinking, this must be part of the whole thing, but they're serious.  Get the fuck out of the water.  Next thing you know, there's a feeding frenzy.  As the last person's being dragged on the boat, these things are jumping out of the water.  Oh, shit.  Like, you would never get that done in America. 
[03:10:00]  No one would allow that.  No, no, that's what it is.  And a lot of people go to these countries and resorts thinking that it's the same safety measures that are taken here,  and you've got to have inspectors and insurance.  Who?  Give a shit.  If you go on a parasail and fucking fly into a pole, you're not suing anybody.  That's why they thought the donkey thing was okay.  Why not?  Yeah, fine.  Give a shit.  If we could think it up, we should do it.  You think there's a Russian ASPCA? 
[03:10:30]  Nah.  They don't give a shit about a donkey.  Remember, we did this bit, and some guy called.  He was in a zoo.  We've all been to zoos.  And you know how you put your quarter in, you get a little feeding?  Yeah.  And they eat out of your hand.  It's all nice for the kids.  Some guy calls, and he swears.  I forgot where the zoo was.  Maybe in India or something.  Where you actually...  No, it can't be India, because they worship everything.  But basically, you can buy a goat and throw it into the lion's cage.  What?  That's what you get to do as a tourist.  We're gone.  That's what you get to do as a tourist.  If this is true, call me now. 
[03:11:00]  If this is true, we're going to go.  If that's what you get to do as a tourist.  Come on.  Imagine filming that.  Dude, you saw that video.  Oh, that is great.  Wow, that is fucked up.  There's like a pen of...  I think he said it was goats.  It was definitely a pretty large animal.  And you, as the tourist, they'll go, all right, I'll buy a goat or whatever.  And you'd hang over your money, and then you'd drag it over to the fucking lion's cage  and throw it overboard.  Throw it into the cage.  Brutal.  Unbelievable, right?  Oh, this guy has info on your Giant Muscles video. 
[03:11:30]  Okay.  Sean in Albany.  Sean.  Hey, guys.  Hey, there, Sean.  It's not an implant or it's not steroids.  What it is is it's called synthol.  It's an oil that people inject into their muscles, and the oil binds with the muscle and forces  it to swell.  It doesn't do anything for strength.  It doesn't do anything for the body.  It's actually very bad for you, but people get obsessed with it, and they end up using  it too much, and people will completely, like...  Oh, my God. 
[03:12:00]  If you go online and search synthol draining, you can find some good videos where someone  either gets...  That doesn't sound good.  Draining?  Yeah, that doesn't sound good.  Yeah, it sounds like something I'm not going to want to fucking watch.  Oh, my God.  That's not real.  If your arm rips open or they have to drain it because they get an infection, it's just  like...  Oh, we're looking at one of these guys.  That looks like a Popeye arm.  It's just...  It's like swollen like...  That's fucked up.  That's swollen like he's...  He has an infection.  How do you explain that?  Yeah. 
[03:12:30]  What the fuck are people doing?  I've never heard them.  You know, they're just weirdos.  Oh, my God.  These are real pictures?  That's real.  It looks real.  That looks real.  Wait, what is this again?  So they can look it up at home?  Sinfall.  Sinfall?  Sinthal.  Sinthal.  So it's S-Y-N-T-H-O-L if you want to look it up at home.  Have you taken Sinthal?  Please call our law firm today.  At Binder and Binder.  Have you muscles drained Sinthal? 
[03:13:00]  So you inject this shit in the muscles and it makes them swell?  Apparently.  Oh, my God.  Get the fuck out of here.  You make your arms look like holiday hams.  We'll talk.  Take care.  Jesus Christ.  That looks fucking...  That is really disturbing.  Yeah.  To go back about those animals, too.  I remember when I was in Mexico for the show, we walked around and stuff and we went to  this, like, this bazaar, this market, whatever, and you could buy just like a monkey, like  it was a pear on the street.  You could buy a monkey.  You could buy anything.  Just like that. 
[03:13:30]  That's something that we do.  Sorry.  What's that mean?  It's a little code.  Yeah.  I mean, just...  That monkey means something else to some people.  Got it.  Yep.  So...  Ah!  Jesus fucking Christ!  Danny, why?  Why do you pull these pictures up?  Is that...  I can't not pull them off.  It's a ball bag.  And he's doing some...  He's injecting some saline into his ball sacks.  Why would you do that?  Where'd you go wrong?  People are weird.  What happened?  What happened?  Where was the line?  I don't know why people do this.  Oh!  Jesus Christ, stop it. 
[03:14:00]  I can't look at this.  I can't look.  That one's kind of funny.  That one was funny.  I don't know if I'd ever be able to...  Oh, okay.  It's China.  We got a guy.  We got a guy.  I knew we'd get a guy.  Brian?  Hey, Oph.  How you doing?  So it's the zoos in China?  Yeah, it's in China.  And you can pick chickens where they hold them outside the bus window, and they'd line  and jump up and grab them, or goats, or whatever, and they're screaming as they're getting 
[03:14:30]  torn apart.  It's unbelievable.  Sorry.  Danny just pulled up a video.  Oh, my God.  It's a guy with a giant ball sack.  Is this meat twist?  Is this meat twist?  No.  That's meat space.  No, this is some guy with a giant ball sack full of saline, I guess, and his big fat  cock full of shit.  It looks fake, but...  It's not fake, though.  It's not.  Where would it be attached?  I know.  And he's out in the middle of the desert, beating off with a giant... 
[03:15:00]  I can't even tell you how giant this is.  It looks like an anteater.  Yeah.  It's just less pointy.  Wait.  Where do they go?  Where do they go?  To hell.  Danny.  You got it.  Let's tweet that.  I'll give you credit.  Give me the link to that.  I'll make a sign of the URL.  Dude, that is hysterical.  Make a sign of the URL.  I'll do a little NSFW, because you've got to see this. 
[03:15:30]  What the fuck?  I don't know, man.  I don't even know what to make of that.  I just...  I'm more into the thought process, like, everything leading up to this video.  Like, he was...  He had that little tingle inside of him that was like, I'm feeling a little rambunctious  right now.  So, all right.  So, let me get my video camera and a syringe.  I'll pump my cock full of saline and make a little video outside.  Like, you have to feel silly walking outside, like you're going to set up your laptop and 
[03:16:00]  your camera.  Yeah, yeah.  And then you've got to get all that saline into your dick and balls.  Can we call Dr. Steve?  I want to know more about this synthol.  Sure.  Because now I'm hearing if you fucking get some of that synthol in a vein, you're done.  Really?  Dead?  Yeah.  So, I want to make sure I fucking...  Well, that probably can't be good to get into your...  Your internal...  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm sure it's not good to have in your muscles.  What are you fucking...  Oh, okay.  Here we go.  So, I love this bit.  We kind of started as well.  We got a couple things going on. 
[03:16:30]  You know, what you get to do as a tourist.  Yeah.  In this country, you fucking...  It's boring shit, right?  You go to Grand Canyon.  You take some pictures.  Ah, you get to ride a fucking mule for a while.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You take a picture with the fireman.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, exactly.  Cops here in New York.  Andy on Long Island has one.  Andy?  What's going on, boys?  Andy.  All right.  One of my friends was vacationing in Asia, and he was in the Philippines, and they had  these small villages where basically they'll let you do anything if you have enough money.  You could... 
[03:17:00]  If you have enough American dollars, they'll let you do whatever you want.  And they had a bunch of guys on a farm, and they had AK-47s, which they just let you fire  off into the woods for like $15.  And for $150, they would give you...  You'd have to actually pay the $150 was to buy the cow, and they would let you shoot  old Russian military surplus RPGs at them in the middle of the field.  That's what you do as a tourist in the Philippines.  That sounds fun.  Yeah, so they let you shoot off surplus rocket launchers at cows in the middle of the field 
[03:17:30]  for $150.  Sorry.  I was just looking at Roger's monster-pumped scrotum that Danny decided to pop up.  Well, it was linked to me by D-Boy, so I can't take full credit for the pumping party.  Fucking D-Boy, how does he know about this?  I don't know.  He knows about pumping parties.  Roger's monster-pumped scrotum.  Wonderful.  I didn't even realize the site that he linked me to is penispumpers.org. 
[03:18:00]  It's an organization.  Nonprofit.  It would be a shame to make a profit of this.  Yes, yes.  It's disrespectful to the families.  You're fucked up, man.  People are just fucked.  All right, Meat Spin's back, everyone.  Ah, there's Meat Spin.  There you go.  For you, Colin.  You said you needed to see that.  Yeah, I did.  Look at that.  I can't believe you've never seen Meat Spin.  No.  Is there sound on this?  I got it.  There it is.  All right, there we go.  So you got it.  Awful.  And it counts how many spins you sat through. 
[03:18:30]  Believe me.  I didn't see that.  Now it says you sat through 50, so you're officially gay.  Oh, so you can sit through like 40 and you're not considered gay?  No.  50 and you're definitely fucking gay.  Huh?  What's the highest you've ever seen it, Danny?  It was probably a Keith special.  Yeah.  I think he put it on one of the computers.  Keith put it on my office computer.  The fuck?  When I was like on vacation.  Well, he was very mad about that.  He said that he was very upset because it restarted the computer. 
[03:19:00]  Yeah, the computer restarted and he was really expecting to see a Meat Spin count of like,  you know, a quarter million.  And he was so upset.  Anthony Comey has the all-time record.  Oh, that's great.  I've come home from vacation and had all my desktop shit just changed to giant black cocks.  Oh, man.  Keith will just fucking redo all of my computers.  He'll put fucking just gay porn up.  Consider yourself a lucky boy.  Oh, yeah.  Believe me.  That's funny.  When I was in college, my buddies used to put just black cocks on my screensaver and I closed 
[03:19:30]  my computer for the year and then I went back to college the following year and I had to  have my computer hooked up, internet, and I had some IT guy come in my room.  It's him and I in my room.  I'm unpacking my boxes and this guy just stops and he's like, I'm like, what's up?  And it's just this black hammer and it's just me and him in the room, dude.  How uncomfortable.  And then I was just like, my friends did it.  He's like, okay, we're just going to get through this.  No, dude, really? 
[03:20:00]  It's not funny.  My friends did it.  There's no way to talk your way out of that one.  Dr. Steve is on the line.  Dr. Steve, sir.  That looks like the intern you got here.  Who's the intern?  Cesar.  Cesar.  Cesar.  Dr. Steve.  I'm in a library in the hospital.  So if all of a sudden I have to go all clinical speak, you'll know why.  Yeah, exactly.  Well, we're thinking of doing a synthol bit for the show.  A synthol bit?  Have you ever heard of synthol? 
[03:20:30]  Yeah.  The mouthwash stuff?  It's like chloral hydrate.  Is that what it is?  I was ready to make fun of you, but maybe it is.  It's what people are using to inject in their muscles to make their muscles look giant,  and they look freakishly like giant biceps and pecs.  Yeah, it's one of those sight enhancement oils.  Ah, that's exactly what somebody said, yes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't know a whole lot about that. 
[03:21:00]  But I know there was this guy that injected his penis with silicone.  Can you say that a little deeper?  With silicone.  And he had this monstrous, it looked like a giant hamster, but it was a penis.  And they had a big frog-like mouth where his meatus was before.  Danny should find that for you.  This guy was really a trip.  It was a meatus.  What is a meatus?  I'm sorry, cockhole.  Is that what that's called, a meatus? 
[03:21:30]  Yeah, meatus.  Did you know that, Ed?  I did not know that.  All right.  I did not know that.  Yeah, people come into the emergency room.  You think I can use that on Jeopardy?  With a swollen meatus?  And it's spelled meatus, which actually makes it so funny.  Which is funny.  People will mispronounce it, and it makes me laugh.  Yeah.  Yeah, the synthol stuff, it's called a sight enhancement oil,  and it increases apparent size of muscles, but it doesn't increase the actual muscle itself. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah.  But who discovered this?  Sounds dangerous.  What did they use that shit for in the medical community before people started doing it recreationally?  Oh, I do it for nothing that I'm aware of unless some of the plastic surgeons are using it.  I mean, I could do some research for you and find out,  but the plastic surgeons might be using it for buttocks enhancements and stuff like that.  Yes.  Colin, you got a medical question?  Because he's a friend of the doctor.  A real live doctor. 
[03:22:30]  You got any problems, any issues, anything going on?  Nothing, no.  Nothing too abnormal.  Nothing?  No.  Oh, you got a something.  He's got a something.  Steve, my ball hurts.  Oh, shit.  Who's that?  It feels like I got a pinched nerve in my ball.  What?  Is it no?  I got a knot in my scrotum.  I need you to work out.  I'm serious.  I'm not fucking around.  I work out.  Can you thumb it for me?  Yeah, does your nut hurt?  Yeah, man.  Did it twist it? 
[03:23:00]  I don't know what I did.  It twisted up.  It just hurts.  It's fine.  I don't feel it at all, but then I'll sit a certain way or my thigh will touch it at  just the right spot, and it's just a shooting pain throughout my whole body.  Are you a bike rider at all, or did you used to be?  No, not really.  Yeah, just Chelsea on Sundays.  You ride as a kid, I guess.  You ride a motorcycle, though.  Yeah, but not even a lot this year.  Yeah, because bike riding, the way that you sit, you lean forward on your taint, and there's  nerves and muscles that run through there, and it can cause a thing called perineal neuropathy, 
[03:23:30]  and it just damages nerves in your taint, and it goes to your cock, and it goes to your  bone.  Oh, no.  This is in my ball.  It's totally in my ball sack.  Okay.  It's my right ball sack, my right ball sack, my right ball.  I think, could I have just, like, sat on it wrong or crushed it in some way?  Yeah, absolutely, or you could have damaged it during vigorous...  Hard fucking...  You know, where you're just slamming your scrotum up against your...  Vigorous intercourse, yes.  Yeah.  Fuck, that's not doctor talk. 
[03:24:00]  I was going to say that...  Vigorous intercourse is a doctor ball injury.  Relax, relax, sir.  Yeah, but you...  This is a family program.  I'm sorry, sorry.  But you can definitely damage nerves, but the other thing that you could have, Danny,  and this is what I want you to do right now, is reach down and feel the nut, and reach around  like a C-clamp behind the nut, and in the upper pole, see if you can reproduce that pain  by squeezing a little structure that's back there called the epididymis.  Ow. 
[03:24:30]  And if you can, then what you may have is just a simple thing called epididymitis, which  is a...  Or you could just have your finger in your ass on the radio.  It's an on-top thing.  There's nothing on bottom.  It's an on-top thing.  Well, it should be on the top of the testicle, but on the back part of the testicle.  No, this is the front.  It's definitely the front.  Danny has his hand.  I'm just playing with my balls on the radio.  And he's playing with his balls right now.  Yeah, if it's definitely on the front of the ball, it's mostly... 
[03:25:00]  No, you know what?  No, it is the back.  It is the back of the ball.  It's past the cyst, but right behind the Starbucks.  I need four square for my balls.  Ah, a little cold.  Is it Big Duties on Twitter?  Yes, it is Big Duties on Twitter.  I'm tweeting...  It's Big Duties in real life, too.  I'm tweeting that...  What is it?  The saline...  Saline dick video.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know what...  If that feels good, why you would want to do that.  Yeah.  I don't get it.  People got to see this one.  I'll continue.  I'm sorry. 
[03:25:30]  Yeah, okay.  So, you got epididymitis.  That just goes away, right?  Like, I don't got to worry about that?  What you need is scrotal support.  If you wear...  I wear boxers.  ...jockey, you got to wear a jock strap.  If you wear boxers, just switch to jockey.  No.  Yeah, just what you got to, dude.  You got to support that shit.  If your balls are hanging, it's putting tension on that epididymis, because it hangs by...  They kind of hang by a strap.  Do your balls hang low?  Do they wobble to and fro?  Can you tie them in a knot, Danny?  Can you tie them in a bow? 
[03:26:00]  Dr. Stevie is suggesting I wear a ball sack sling.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Yes, I am.  Well, that's ridiculous.  You'll take the pressure off that epididymis, and then it'll heal.  If you don't, it just continues to traumatize itself once you have it.  By the way, why are you in a library?  Isn't that a place for homeless guys and, like, pedos and shit?  What?  I'm actually on the cancer floor in the library.  Oh, Jesus Christ. 
[03:26:30]  That's terrible.  There's a cancer floor in the library?  Yeah, we have a cancer center, and that's where I generally work, and then there's a library.  That's where you hide the tumors?  Jeez, what a happy place.  So I can usually talk freely.  You're a real dreg.  Yeah, really?  There's a cancer section in the library, and that's where Dr. Steve chooses to hang out.  I like to hang.  That's where I party.  Right.  Jesus.  Oh, God.  Yeah, I got to say this. 
[03:27:00]  I was bringing it up yesterday, but Dr. Steve was kind enough to give me a weapon.  Weapon.  Sorry, sorry.  To give me a weapon about, I don't know, a year and a half ago.  It was a while ago.  I think it was longer than that.  Yeah, probably two years ago.  And it's a pistol put out by the same people that make the Desert Eagle.  And it fires a, what is it, a 7-6-2.  7-6-2.  7-6-2.  7-millimeter 08.  Yeah.  It's, but it's a pistol.  It's a deer rifle that you hold in your hand, is what this fucking thing was. 
[03:27:30]  It had such a kick on it, it almost flew out of my hands the first time I shot it, until  I realized you had to kind of let the kick go straight back at you instead of up.  But you were saying somebody was hitting 50 yards away and hitting, what, one-inch group?  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, you got to do it, you know, at a bench rest where you can kind of rest your hands. 
[03:28:00]  Magnum Research puts it out.  It's called a...  It's the greatest gun in the world.  It is the sickest fucking pistol.  It's a pistol with a big scope on it, and it's just scary as shit to shoot.  Makes a big, loud noise, and the kick is fucked.  And I went shooting the other day with it, and then yesterday, I'm working out, and my  wrist was fucking killing me from that goddamn gun.  Okay.  And he gave you this? 
[03:28:30]  Yeah.  It's a great gun to just hand to somebody and say, here, take a shot.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  You just, yeah, take a shot with this.  Boom.  And then you just laugh your ass off.  Only one round loads in the back like a howitzer.  It fucking loads in.  You turn this fucking knob to lock the round in.  Out of a rotary breach.  Yeah.  And then you have a little charging handle on the side, and then, boom!  And, dude, that is a hair fucking trigger on it.  You can't have your finger anywhere near the trigger until you are ready to fucking shoot 
[03:29:00]  it, because any little touch of the trigger and that thing goes off.  Yeah.  What a dangerous gun you gave me.  I didn't know Dr. Steve was a gun guy.  I didn't know you were a gun guy, sir.  Oh, yeah.  And I...  My dad was a sharpshooter, and so he taught me how to shoot when I was a kid.  So, you know, I've always had some guns, but this was one of my favorites, and it was  one of those I never get to shoot now that I've got kids.  Well, more importantly, let's talk about the best gift you have sent me. 
[03:29:30]  Wine?  Yeah.  What would that be?  What's that?  What was the best gift you gave me?  The weird medicine fucking coffee mug?  Maybe that's it, right?  That was terrific.  The Cobain autograph?  That's just as good as a fucking gun.  No kidding.  To Anthony?  Yeah.  Absolutely.  I threw the Cobain autograph away.  It didn't look real.  It didn't look real.  It didn't look really. 
[03:30:00]  It didn't look real.  What an ass.  You threw it away.  Oh, I think that's it.  Wait.  Wait, you gave me that?  It's close.  Which one?  Are you talking to me?  Yeah, which one?  I gave you the framed Kurt Cobain autograph from his estate.  Wait a minute.  Let's get to the bottom of this.  I didn't know you when you sent me that.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, no.  Yeah, it was early on in our relationship.  I swear to God, that hangs in my apartment. 
[03:30:30]  No, the other one, the fake one that someone gave me, I threw away.  That one I put on my wall, and I still to this day don't know if it's real or not.  Yeah, I sent you two, because somebody had sent me one, but it was obviously a photograph,  you know, like a photocopy.  Yeah, that one went through.  I went ahead and sent it to you anyway.  I said this is a piece of shit, but I'm going to get you the real one.  And then I went, you know, and got the other one and sent it to you.  Yeah, where Kurt's wearing the glasses? 
[03:31:00]  Yeah.  I don't know.  It was a photo of him, and then under it there's a...  Yeah, yeah.  No, I swear to God, I got that hanging up.  And you think that's real?  Yeah, absolutely.  Holy shit.  I bow to you.  I can't even make fun of you.  I didn't know that was you.  That was before we became friends.  Yeah, right, right, right.  I'm learning this for the first time right now.  He did give me something cool.  Yeah, see?  Fuck, I can't even make fun of you.  It was good gifts.  Well, it's just, you talked about it on the air, said one of the coolest things that I 
[03:31:30]  have is given to me by Dr. Steve, but at that point, we had never spoken on the phone  together.  Oh, I got you.  By the way, when I said, you know, the gift, the gift you gave me, this wise-ass wrote on  Instant Feedback AIDS.  So, I want to thank Dr. Steve for the AIDS as well.  I do have to cop to that as well.  Puts it in his wine.  It has a nice flavor.  Oops.  Oops.  He's making wine.  You don't want to hear Dr. Steve go, oops.  Dr. Steve, we got a real question coming in from Caesar in Brooklyn. 
[03:32:00]  Caesar, you're on with the great Dr. Steve.  How you doing, guys?  Good.  I asked Dr. Steve this on his voicemail for his show.  I figured I asked it on your show.  I heard about when you take an onion, the skin, if you were to rub it on a woman's pussy,  that her pussy would, I guess, shrivel up somehow, and within a few days, she would die.  He's laughing at you. 
[03:32:30]  Caesar.  Yeah.  This was going to be the focus of my next show, and now I can't use it.  Oh, really?  Really?  Yes.  It's one of the greatest questions ever.  Well, you didn't answer the question, so now that's the tease for Weird Medicine.  Yeah, there you go.  I'll hang up on it.  We'll talk about that on the July 31st edition of Weird Medicine.  Wow.  So you're doing a whole show about that?  Well, I mean, you know, I usually take a couple of the really oddball questions and 
[03:33:00]  sort of showcase them, and that would be one of them.  That would be one of them.  And do a little Mythbusters.  All right.  Those guys.  Who's going to be the test subject?  Those homos in a garage with the beret.  Oh, you must insult Danny.  Oh, yeah.  Look out.  Take it out.  I love the Mythbusters.  Take it out on Danny.  Do you love them?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  What don't you like about them, Colin?  I think I busted the myth.  They're homos.  Let's be serious.  It's this dude with his beret, and they go into a garage, and they just create stuff,  and making cock pumps. 
[03:33:30]  No.  I understand it's informative.  It's okay to be smart, isn't it?  Yeah.  Faggots.  Whenever I don't have a joke.  Go and you need something, faggot.  Whenever I don't have anything funny to say, you just call them a fag.  That's how you get out of it.  Yeah.  Oh, they're there.  It's always been the way.  We've met them.  They've been on the show.  I'm sure that they are.  From my take, just watching it, yeah, they do do cool stuff.  It is pretty fun.  Yeah, it is.  You know what?  It's just the appearance that, for me, it's just two men. 
[03:34:00]  They seem a little...  They do.  I think everybody that comes out of that Bay Area is a little fruitatious.  Never seen them have any interest in girls on the show whatsoever.  Oh.  I thought the same thing.  A lot of people, when you bring up the Mythbusters, there's always this weird gay thing, right?  Yeah.  But there was one reference, I guess, I think Adam had mentioned it, but he burnt off some  of his hair, the red-headed guy.  And he did get upset because he did have a date, and he wanted to make sure he looked 
[03:34:30]  good for his date.  Well, date could mean anything.  Yeah, but date could mean anything.  For Christ's sake.  Why don't they bust a Heimann?  They're both married, I think, actually.  Yeah.  Mythbust a Heimann.  They say on their website that they're both married and both not even remotely gay, so  that means they're gay.  Not even remotely gay.  Yeah.  And I don't think I look like the one guy.  Fuck you.  On the left?  Yeah, someone has said that to me before.  Now, if you just injected yourself with Synthol, look at the size of his head, dude. 
[03:35:00]  Look at that thing, dude.  Look at the size of that thing, dude.  Now, if you want to talk gay, we could talk American Pickers.  I haven't seen the show.  Because something is very gay about that.  Oh, Pickers.  Anthony.  Sorry.  I hear that's a good show.  I haven't seen it yet, though.  It's these two guys.  They own this restoration antique business, and they just drive around in a van all day.  The second you say guy and antiques, it's gay. 
[03:35:30]  Yeah.  It's basically, they figured out how to make, the History Channel is just brilliant, because  they really figured out how to make Antique Roadshow for guys who would never be caught  dead watching the Antique Roadshow.  They have Pawn Stars and American Pickers, which is virtually the same show.  Let's slow down, though.  Why can't a guy watch Antique Roadshow?  I watch that.  Because I think there's something about it.  It's hilarious when the dummies think they got something amazing, and they go, yeah,  that's maybe $7.  That makes me laugh so fucking hard. 
[03:36:00]  There's some weird stigma attached to it, where I think if you said to your friends,  oh, dude, I was watching Antique Roadshow, they'd be like, why?  Really?  But then you could go, oh, dude, I was watching Pawn Stars the other day, and they're like,  oh, cool, yeah, me too.  Pawn Stars is a good show.  And it's pretty much the same thing.  A guy walks in, has a fucking thing, wants a piece of shit.  It's Antique Roadshows with tattoos.  Yeah.  But you know the Pawn guys aren't telling you the truth.  Oh, they are fucking thieves.  You're walking in with something, and they're like salivating, like, holy shit, that's got 
[03:36:30]  to be $200 fucking thousand dollars.  You realize that you're talking about nothing.  Pawn shop owners.  Yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  In Vegas.  In Vegas.  I think they're in a tough spot, because they're filming a TV show, like, fuck, if  this wasn't on fucking film, I would be ripping this off, ripping this motherfucker off.  That guy says that all the time.  He's like, look, this is a business, I gotta make money.  It's like, if you want to go to an auction and maybe get that for it, fine, here's what  I'm gonna give you.  It's like, yeah, you gotta make money, but you gotta make that much fucking money, you prick. 
[03:37:00]  And I'm all for it, because you know what, something, I hate when people say, oh, I  got this, oh, it's worth this, it's worth that, fuck that.  Something is only worth as much as someone else is willing to pay for it.  I don't care what it's worth.  What can you really get for it, because that's what it's worth.  So I don't give a fuck if you can get eight grand at an auction.  But the fucked up thing is, sometimes they have an appraiser come in, and right in front  of the guy that owns it, it'll be like, yeah, this is like about $12,000.  And the pawn guy goes, 800, I'll give you.  Yeah.  And the guy's like, meanwhile, the guy just wants to get back to the blackjack table and 
[03:37:30]  try to make his fucking house payment back.  And that's what the guy says, he goes, sure, you can get $12,000 at an auction if you want  to pay the auction fees and, you know, wait for the right guy to come around who's willing  to spend that, and then maybe you'll, then you'll get your money in six months, or I'll  give you four grand right now.  He doesn't lie, he's not like, he doesn't say, oh, you can't get that at an auction.  He goes, you can, but, you know, it'll take six to eight months and fees and percentages  and shit, or I'll give you this right now.  Right now.  Dr. Steve, anything else?  Freeps. 
[03:38:00]  I just went on the U.S. National Library of Medicine site about the Synthol.  Oh, we were just there.  Oh, were you?  No.  Do you got your cock in your hands?  Are you whacking your bag?  Oh, yeah.  Jesus.  Right.  That's Steve.  Yeah.  It just says the side effects of Synthol are manifold, and they can cause damage of nerves,  oil embolism of the pulmonary arteries. 
[03:38:30]  That's bad, by the way.  That's where they accidentally inject into a vein.  Yeah.  It ends up a big glob of this stuff goes into the heart and then gets shoved out into the lungs.  Occlusion of the pulmonary artery, myocardial infarction, okay, heart attack, stroke, and infection.  So it doesn't look like a good thing.  I don't know what the context of what you were talking about it was.  Sounds well worth having giant, ridiculous-looking, fake muscles.  Yeah.  I'm going to send you a video of a guy jerking off his Syntholed penis. 
[03:39:00]  He's not really jerking.  He's just kind of mushing it.  He's playing with it.  He's mushing it.  Is that the silicone penis guy?  Yeah, yeah.  I tweeted it.  Yeah, yeah.  I tweeted it.  Go look at my Twitter.  He's just standing in the desert.  Yeah.  Manipulating himself.  Oh, well, there's another one.  There's a British TV show where they showed this guy, and he's talking about it, and he's  just talked about how he gets his sexual satisfaction out of having this giant penis, even though  it's not functional anymore.  It's not functional. 
[03:39:30]  That's why I use it all the time.  I've injected myself, so I have a giant penis.  Hey, don't you sing-y-songy-talky.  Remember at NAW, we brought in the guy that had the two-foot penis?  You remember that guy?  Two foot.  Oh, yeah, but he would pull it.  No, dude.  He was pulling it down and then measuring, and it would creep back up.  Oh, really?  Can you make yours close to two feet fucking long?  Pulling it down his leg and shit.  It was fake lean.  Remember, he came in with white spandex shorts? 
[03:40:00]  Like, really?  Well, he was getting in trouble.  He was the guy that was getting in trouble outside the building because he was walking  out with a giant cock in his pants.  E-Rock, do you have pictures of that?  That's the one you got to tweet today.  I don't remember that, but I'll look for them.  I forgot the whole story, but I think...  It's in your personal fucking pictures.  But in your cell phone.  Those guys that wrap their penis around the stick and then have people stand on it.  Ah, that's good.  And the outtakes in Jackass, too.  This guy was legit, and he wanted us to talk about other stuff about him. 
[03:40:30]  I'm like, you've got a big fucking hog.  We're going to talk about that for a minute.  Bad music.  Right.  He had some other thing going on.  But it was legit.  It was like a Guinness Book of World Record thing or something.  He had some...  Well, Guinness doesn't do a giant cock record.  And he had to fucking walk in with the spandex, and then we brought the women in, and they  started laughing at him.  Yeah.  Openly laughing, and then he got mad.  He wasn't happy about that.  Because he was, like, pulling it all the time.  He was a freak of nature.  Yeah.  It's like Ripley's.  Ripley's Believe It or Not. 
[03:41:00]  Yeah.  Believe It or Not.  Mark in Canada says, go to break.  I don't.  He has the shit.  That means we're doing a good show.  He's holding in a shit for this.  Yeah.  Hold in your dump.  All right, boys.  Yeah.  Dr. Steve's got to go.  I'm going to go save a life.  He's a very busy man.  Where are you going, Steve?  He's fucking...  Agatha got paged.  I can't believe that I...  Well, snake a tube down our throat and tell her I'll be in by...  I can't believe that Kurt Cobain is real, and I can't believe you were the one that gave  it to me before we knew each other. 
[03:41:30]  See, you called him out.  Yeah, you used to remember that, but it's funny how those things just fade from your memory.  You called him out, and he came back.  He just called you an asshole.  He faked his face.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  That was the same way of saying it.  You know what?  Gotta go.  I take a lot of shots.  I gotta allow a few shots back, man.  Dude, the guy just got paged.  I have to.  He's on a cancer ward.  Geez.  What are they paging you for?  They can wait.  Oh, shit.  Steve is killing today.  I hope not.  All right, Steve. 
[03:42:00]  Thank you, sir.  Weird Medicine, when's the next show?  It'll be July 31st.  It's Big Keg.  I almost said Big Kegs, Gief Stuff, whatever.  All right.  A week from Saturday.  A week from Saturday is the next Weird Medicine.  A week from Saturday.  All right.  Thanks, Dr. Steve.  Okay.  See ya.  All right.  Dr. Steve's the best.  He does give good gifts, too.  He does.  He totally nailed me on that one.  Isn't that funny that you got a Kurt Cobain thing and I got a gun?  No.  Isn't it funny that he...  It's a little odd.  Yeah.  Hey, what's your favorite show on TV, Colin? 
[03:42:30]  You watch any weird TV?  I don't have a TV in my room, but as far as sitcoms...  Why don't you have a TV?  I just...  Are you one of those guys, a true artist?  I don't want to be influenced by anything.  I don't watch television, man.  You really think I'm like that?  No.  Of course not.  But why don't you have a TV?  Because I got a flat screen and I took off the backing of it so I could mount it and  then I lost it.  So I just have the fucking...  I don't want to stand to it anymore.  So I had a flat screen just sitting on my floor.  So I'm like, fuck it.  So I just put it in my hallway and left a note.  Take my TV.  Left a note.  I was just in one of those moods and I was like, take my TV. 
[03:43:00]  It was gone in a second.  Some 80-year-old lady in my building is bringing it up the stairs.  That's what it was.  Or my super, too.  Holy shit.  My super, yeah.  My super...  Oh, forget it.  I don't know why they associate the word super with these people.  The Latin king who lives under the stairs for free.  It's...  You know?  I'm the super, really?  He shows up.  He shows up 30 minutes seriously.  Two days late.  You know, Cheetos in his chest hair.  He's got six kids with him.  I took a dump and it was the dump that clogged the toilet. 
[03:43:30]  It wasn't the paper towels.  Everyone guys wiped their eyes the paper towels.  It was the dump.  And he's like...  He looked at it.  He's like, oh, you don't make good decisions.  You don't make good decisions.  Pointing to the toilet.  I'm like, really, dude?  I shit.  Things didn't work out.  I called you.  You don't make good decisions.  Yeah, right?  So, it's just...  Yeah.  But the TV thing, yeah.  I threw, you know.  It's just...  But TVs, I like Burn Notice.  That's a cool show.  I don't know if you can check it out.  TNT?  Not TNT.  I think it's TNT.  You don't mind not having a TV?  I don't know, Burn Notice. 
[03:44:00]  It's on your website.  A lot of times I watch stuff online.  Like, you know.  Yeah.  I watch TV online.  But I'd rather have the online stuff go to my TV.  Like, so it's a bigger screen and shit like that, you know.  Yeah.  I don't watch it on a small screen.  I can't fucking deal with life without television.  It has to be on all the time.  Like, I have...  I cannot count how many televisions I have in my house.  It's retarded, the amount I have in my house.  How many do you got?  Because I need...  I don't know. 
[03:44:30]  I got five.  Oof.  That's bad.  No, I got...  Way more than five.  I thought five was pretty good.  Does the theater count?  Yeah.  I got five TVs and four computers.  And I know you're going to beat that easily.  You're still counting.  Holy shit.  Oh, yeah.  You know what I've been doing?  You do appreciate it.  Ope and Anthony, you guys know what Chinese confusion is?  No.  It's when, you know, I take out my phone.  I call a Chinese place right now. 
[03:45:00]  And then they're like, hello.  And I go, hi, how are you doing?  Like, place an order?  And they're like, okay.  I'm like, all right, can you just hold on one second?  I want to see what my brother wants.  And then I call one of my friends on the phone.  And then as soon as he picks up, I hit three-way.  And you just watch what happens.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I've been doing this to my friend.  And I've been doing it for six months straight.  For six months, we've been taping it.  And he's losing his shit.  He's calling Verizon.  He's blogging out.  And I have a tape of him just losing it.  It starts out being kind.  And then he's starting to curse them.  Yeah.  Make a long story short.  Actually, I'm going to cut a DVD of it. 
[03:45:30]  Oh, cool.  And mail it to his office.  It's funny if you know who he is.  Right.  It's just one of those things that...  But the listeners should fucking...  That's something the listeners would love to check out.  You should put that somewhere.  Yeah.  Well, the new site's going to be up in a month.  So I'm putting tons of...  All right, good.  Yeah, new site's going to be up in a month.  To count the one in the bathroom, in my upstairs bathroom.  Danny's doing the counting for you.  It's up to nine.  I have nine TVs in my house.  And a theater screen.  Well, eight TVs and a theater screen.  The theater makes up for like 15 TVs right there.  And then his theater screen is just as big as the artsy theater screen. 
[03:46:00]  It's 11 feet wide.  You know, it's great.  Yeah.  It's fucking great.  He's got 11 and shit like that.  Nah, you appreciate that, though.  But you enjoy...  I love that shit, yeah.  Burn Notice.  A lot of people know it.  Because Bruce Campbell's in Burn Notice.  There he is.  That's his theater?  Yeah.  Look at that.  Look how happy you are.  I am fucking very happy.  I've never seen you this happy.  Look at this.  That should be...  Why wouldn't you be happy?  That should be...  And you notice...  He's titled Life O'Reilly.  He's alone.  Yeah, I know, right? 
[03:46:30]  But that makes him happy.  I know.  He likes that.  He likes that alone.  You know what...  But there's a difference between loneliness and solitude.  Yeah, true.  That's the difference.  You know what?  That is the only theater that I can go into, though.  And there's a certain word I could scream out that I want to scream in every movie theater.  Yes.  Exactly.  Exactly.  All right.  We've got to wrap up.  Oh, wow.  Holy shit.  What happened?  I went fast today.  Yeah, I don't even know if we... 
[03:47:00]  A Christmas tree and an Uzi.  Why not, right?  I just have some really weird pictures online.  Oxymoronic in a strange way.  Yes, it should be a menorah and an Uzi.  You got good pictures, though.  Oh, I got fucking psychopath pictures up all over the net.  This shit never goes away, does it?  You don't care after a while.  You just gotta let it go.  Yeah, that was a bad one.  What happened?  There's just me with guns. 
[03:47:30]  The majority of pictures I have is me with guns, me with a car.  Just fucking sick.  Oh, the young, innocent Anthony.  Yeah.  That was so long ago.  All right.  We'll get some plugs and get the fuck out of here, Anthony.  Today was one of those shows, I don't even know if we did anything.  I don't even know if we did anything.  I have no idea.  What a great fucking show today was.  I know I had fun.  Sandy Cain and the Naked Cowboy and Ron the Lawyer. 
[03:48:00]  It was great.  Sure.  Colin Cain on Twitter.  That's K-A-N-E.  Colin Cain, one word on Twitter.  I follow Colin Cain.  And Colin's playing West End Johnnies, formerly Johnnies on the side in the Boston area.  138 Portland Street, and that will be this Saturday.  Yeah.  So please, we got a big audience in Boston.  Go see Colin Cain.  Thanks.  You're not going to be disappointed.  You can buy tickets at ColinCain.com.  Okay, cool.  And that's going to be the website that you're revamping?  Yeah, it's going to be a huge launch. 
[03:48:30]  Yeah, because what you just said sounded cool, but I want to see it now.  So now I'm kind of frustrated.  The Chinese thing?  Yeah, real funny.  I'm having a big launch.  Well, why don't you bring the audio in?  Let's listen to some of the audio.  Done.  Done.  So bring it next time you come in.  We'll cut it up a little bit and make it good.  We should actually, no, we should do.  We should call my boy.  He doesn't know that we did this to him.  We should call him and announce on the show that I've been doing this to him.  Oh, he doesn't know?  He has no idea.  He's losing his mind.  But does he know now?  No, he doesn't listen to O&A.  Oh, that's nice.  I know.  He's a true friend. 
[03:49:00]  Thanks.  We should try doing one cold right now.  So, you want to call him?  Yeah, but if it's, all right, we won't say shit.  What are the rules?  The rule is basically, I call it, but Chinese places, what one's open right now?  It's 10.30 in the morning.  Are they kidding me?  They work all the time.  All right.  They're always open.  They never close.  What exactly are rules?  Just pull up Chinese places right now in New York City that are open.  We'll call one.  There are certain rules we have to add here, too.  People can't be on the air unless they know they're on the air. 
[03:49:30]  They have to know they're on the air.  You know what?  Fuck that.  Howard's doing prank calls all the time.  We could do a fucking prank call.  They're not real.  The Howard calls aren't real?  I'm speculating, but I know the rules.  I know legally you cannot put someone on the air.  Let's break a rule today.  I have a staff meeting later today.  How about you just don't?  Because you guys just get to go in the elevator, and we have to sit there in the office.  I just know the rules.  That's true.  We do fucking crash cars here and then make everyone else clean them up. 
[03:50:00]  Yeah, the wreckage.  We just leave.  We crawl out of the wreckage and just run away from the scene.  And we hail a cab, and we're out of the area, and everyone else has to deal with the  mess.  Ah, fuck.  All right.  Colin, thank you, man.  Thanks for having me, guys.  Thanks, Anthony.  Another very good appearance on the show.  Thank you, guys.  No problem.  And I think we did everything.  So we'll see you guys tomorrow.  Chop, chop.  All right. </pre>
