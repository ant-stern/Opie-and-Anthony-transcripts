<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with the hosts’ usual chaotic and exaggerated banter, quickly transitioning to a disturbing anecdote about witnessing a girl with intellectual disabilities being assaulted at a "ramen fest."  This segued into a protracted negotiation with show employee Earl concerning a segment where Earl would be painted white for a paint company sponsorship.  Earl vehemently refused despite offers of a portion of his salary and a half-hour slot to host his "Black Rock Coalition" show. Numerous callers, including several black listeners, weighed in on the potential racial implications of the bit, with opinions varying widely. The hosts attempted to justify the segment by referencing similar comedic bits from other celebrities like Eddie Murphy, but Earl remained resolute in his refusal.

The broadcast included numerous promotional spots for *Joe Dirt*, Planet Java iced coffee, and a "Whipped Cream Bikini Contest."  Extensive discussion surrounded a *Star* magazine article claiming Dominic Chianese (Uncle Junior from *The Sopranos*) was gay, with audio clips of Chianese vehemently denying the claim being played.  A caller, Kelly, recounted a story about Jay Moore touching her breasts in front of her boyfriend, sparking further discussion of Moore’s appearances on shows like *Regis and Kelly*, which in turn devolved into graphic, comedic speculation about Kelly Ripa’s pregnancy and Regis Philbin’s supposed reactions.  Callers debated whether various items—Louis Black’s shaky hands, Geneva Ruffles’ notepad, Richard Pryor’s wheelchair—qualified as comedy props.  Another caller revealed his father to be the actor who played Johnny Sack on *The Sopranos*.  Comedian Jeff Norris ("Gorilla Boy") then called in with a bizarre tale of a prop gun from a *Law & Order* set ending up on his car dashboard, leading to a police encounter.  Rick, Ben, Paul Mercurio, and Mike DiNicola were mentioned as being present in the studio.

The show continued with a listener's joke about a baseball bat in his trunk, followed by a lengthy Rockaway Bedding advertisement peppered with absurd tangents about flying mattresses and a fictional story involving Norris, BuzzFund, and ether.  A vulgar, sexually explicit Columbo skit ensued.  Paul Mercurio, a *Daily Show* writer, appeared as a guest.  A call from “Brother Weez” in Florida detailed a radio interview where Weez called Dominic Chianese effeminate, causing a strong reaction from Chianese’s representatives.  Weez's account was punctuated by updates on his stressful Disney World trip.  The conversation shifted to a *Sopranos* scene involving Paulie Walnuts sniffing a woman’s panties, prompting further crude jokes. Weez's call continued with homophobic slurs and insults exchanged with the hosts before abruptly ending.  A phone interview with Barley Scotch, the lead singer of Hayseed Dixie (a band covering AC/DC songs), followed.  The interview was filled with Southern colloquialisms, off-color jokes about incest, and anecdotes about the band’s origins.

A call from Psycho Mark in Jamaica detailed his drug-fueled vacation, including encounters with people from *High Times* magazine.  The call was heavily suggestive of drug use and profanity-laden.  The segment concluded with more discussion of Mercurio, further musical interludes from Hayseed Dixie, and additional jokes from the hosts and guests, including brief calls from Mike DiNicola and Louis Black.  The conversation touched upon a news story about exploding cows in Austria and further vulgar jokes about *The Weakest Link* host.

A segment with Lewis Black as a guest began with discussions about Black's health issues, humorously described as potentially a baby or conjoined twin.  This transitioned to jokes about Black’s new luxurious apartment, leading to a heated debate about wealth inequality, taxes, and socialism.  Black expressed frustration over the perceived preferential treatment of the wealthy. The exchange involved a humorous, vulgar back-and-forth, including insults and personal attacks.  The show featured listener calls and another call from Psycho Mark, this time detailing his activities in Jamaica with "Kat" from a previous Best Breast Contest, including heavy marijuana use.  Extended segments featured a recurring “Uncle Junior” character in various crude and sexually suggestive scenarios. Victory Limousines and Stacker 2 were among the numerous sponsors advertised.  The show ended with listener calls summarizing their "learnings" from the broadcast, concluding with promotions for upcoming events and the "Whipped Cream Bikini Contest."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I'm used to the crazy people.  See you?  Hopi.  Don't ever underestimate the psycho factor in my head.  Are you mental?  No! It's our show!  I'm a madman!  I'm getting pissed!  You sound like a stock-raving mad person.  No!  I'm getting pissed!  No!  No!  Don't ever underestimate the psycho factor in my head.  No!  How can you tell who's sane and who's insane? 
[00:00:30]  327-WNEW.  Okay, terrific.  Wow, that's loud.  Sorry about that.  Everything's a little loud today.  That is true.  Really, when you think about it. 
[00:01:00]  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  It's the O&A show!  Uh...  I'm deeply disturbed.  I just saw a retarded girl get beat up.  Wow!  Just when I thought I'd seen it all.  You know?  That goddamn ramen fest, huh?  How about that?  Just when, uh...  Just when you think we're taking it to the limit on this program,  they go completely off the scale. 
[00:01:30]  We've watched the retarded girl go down.  Opie, I don't think she's retarded.  Oh, no.  No.  Took a few blows to the head.  And went down.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, bravo to run a fest.  That was something to watch.  My God.  She just got pummeled.  Why didn't they videotape that?  They don't want evidence? 
[00:02:00]  Maybe.  It was amazing.  All right.  We'll have to get that in here to talk about that a little later, maybe.  Yeah.  All right.  We got to get Earl in here immediately  to continue our little discussion that we're having in the back office.  Earl wanted five minutes to think about a proposition that we made.  Right.  And there's five minutes are up.  And we'd like an answer.  While we get Earl,  you said he would think about it.  We were negotiating hard in the back office 
[00:02:30]  because Jeff, the dump guy.  What?  Who?  Oh, that guy.  I'm the only one?  Oh, that guy.  I wasn't too...  Rick walked in on him.  Oh, my God.  I wasn't too much of a stretch.  Taking him.  You walked in on him when he was dumping.  I walked out.  So his new name was Jeff, the dump guy.  That was only going to be brought forth through hypnosis later in life.  Remember, Jeff was in the no-crunching bathroom during the show,  and Rick needed to relieve himself. 
[00:03:00]  Open the door, and there's Jeff, the dump guy, taking one.  Taking a dump in the no-crunch bathroom.  With the door open.  Damn it.  That's disgusting.  What?  Earl's busy.  Now he's busy.  Busy?  Impossible.  Get him down.  What's he busy doing?  Rick, go get him.  Tell him he's wasting valuable air time.  What's he busy doing?  Anyway, Jeff, the dump guy, comes into our office,  and he says,  Hey, you know, I'm in a little bind. 
[00:03:30]  I have this client that wants to spend some very good money on your radio show.  Some kind of paint supply store?  Paint company.  Like paint?  Like artist paint, I believe.  Is it?  I think it's like house paint.  You think it's house paint?  I think.  No, no, I think it's what I'm saying.  I think it's like an art store or whatever.  I think so.  Where they have the paint and the boxes and stuff.  Yeah.  I don't know about that, my friend.  No? 
[00:04:00]  I'll bet you.  I'm not sure.  It ain't house paint.  I just know the name.  Because then you wouldn't have went for the idea.  Jeff would go, well, no, because that's not what they're getting at here.  I think they care.  No, it's definitely like an art supply store.  I could check immediately.  Here comes Earl.  He's getting pushed into the studio by Rick.  My God, he doesn't walk.  Earl.  Yeah.  Why the frown?  What frown?  You're getting a lot of air time lately on our show.  Turn that frown upside down.  Earl, it's been five minutes, and your answer? 
[00:04:30]  No.  What?  They're all still parking the van.  Why now?  You can, Ben, you can gladly drive it if you want to.  Oh, jeez.  Woo.  Earl, why are you lashing out?  Aren't we all friends here?  Yes.  Come on.  So why the hostility for it, Ben?  Because I'm always breaking my balls about the van.  I'm like, okay, you drive it.  Why are you busting his balls about the van, Ben?  Do you have any reason?  I don't know.  I just was busting his balls. 
[00:05:00]  You all right, Earl?  Oh, my God.  Paint, wallpaper.  Yeah.  Paint.  Remodeling projects.  It's paint like that.  Oh.  So it has nothing to do with, like, art?  Not that I see.  Are you looking up the right company?  Abrasives, adhesives, applicated cleaners, ladders, scaffolding, equipment stains, varnishes,  thinners, spray paints.  Yeah, look.  See?  Look at the name.  Uh, okay. 
[00:05:30]  Well, you are right.  I would have lost that bet.  I was in construction.  Earl, what's the problem with the bit?  We haven't really explained it yet to people.  I don't know.  I'm not feeling it.  It's just wrong.  You're not feeling it?  Why is it wrong?  It is just wrong.  Well, here's the idea.  See, this paint company, you know, they want to do something with their paints in our show.  And we've been, you know, throwing around some ideas and stuff.  Yeah.  And then jokingly, Ben, out of nowhere, goes, I got an idea that'll make everyone happy. 
[00:06:00]  And that idea, Ben?  Paint Earl White.  Exactly.  I haven't heard Ben that excited in many months, because it would be so much fun.  Paint Earl White.  You're known as Black Earl.  And the reason, not because you're a black man, but because you wear black.  You can still be Black Earl, because you can still dress in black.  So we want to make you White Earl for one afternoon. 
[00:06:30]  Maybe.  The listeners are eating it up already on the phone lines.  No.  Come on, we paint you up.  Earl, this was the idea.  So we have a before picture of Earl.  And you'll get to see him in all his glory.  He wears black every single day.  Anthony and I have been here almost three years.  I don't think we've ever seen him in another color besides black.  No.  Except for the softball game, because he had to wear the uniform.  Which was mostly black.  It was black.  Right.  We had some pinstripes in there.  So we'll do the before picture of Earl. 
[00:07:00]  Black Earl.  And then we want to paint you on the show.  Paint you white.  And then paint you white.  Paint it.  And then we want to have a shot of that on the website.  And I'm telling you, the audience would go nuts.  Come on.  We paint each other up.  Have a good time.  Chase each other around with the hot mops.  Now, Earl, what's the problem with this bit?  We all go in the barrel.  This is just wrong.  I was explaining to Earl, I can't hang out with my relatives anymore ever since I said I hated my grandma.  Yeah.  Come on, Earl.  The dead one, by the way, if my family's listening. 
[00:07:30]  Not the one that's living.  We all love her.  Come on, Earl.  It'll be so much fun.  What is the problem?  This is something very, very...  Explain the problem with the bit.  Very, very wrong with it.  I put a lot on the table.  We were negotiating hard back there, weren't we?  I offered him 10% of his yearly salary.  Three dollars.  I offered him a tenth of his yearly salary for one bit.  And then the offer, though. 
[00:08:00]  The big one that I think...  This is what made him go, I'll think about it.  I'll think about it for five minutes.  Right.  I said I'd think about it because you were throwing so many incentives at me.  No, this incentive...  You were negotiating hard.  This incentive is huge because I know how important this is to Earl.  He wants to have a Black Coalition rock show.  Right.  So I said you give us a chance to paint you white for the day.  For the first show, not even.  And you could even shower.  It'll come right off.  We'll make sure it's temporary paint.  Latex.  It washes right off.  Not only will we give you a tenth of your yearly salary, which is insane, 
[00:08:30]  we'll also give you a half hour to do whatever you want on the radio.  Now, we did it the last time and we tricked you.  Right.  You are right.  But this time, we'll play it straight.  Where Anthony and I leave the studio, you've got a half hour to do whatever you want.  So you can do the Black Rock Coalition.  And you never know who's going to be listening.  That is huge.  A lot of people listen to this afternoon show.  It's just showcasing something you want to do.  And you never know.  Someone might be listening and say, hey, that's a great idea. 
[00:09:00]  And then Earl goes, I don't trust you guys.  I'm like, fine, let's bring a lawyer in.  We'll sign something out there.  Sign a contract.  Do whatever it takes.  Won't even be in the studio.  So not only do you get a tenth of your yearly salary, you get a half hour Black Rock Coalition show.  And there's a few people that listen to this radio program, Earl.  Well, I didn't know that, but I can't do it.  Why?  It's all in fun.  Remember Eddie Murphy?  It was in fun when he was in.  I also remember Anderson Andy.  Why?  No one painted them white? 
[00:09:30]  They never went white.  This is just wrong.  If Eddie Murphy can do it, I think you can do it.  Yeah.  You want anybody to paint themselves black at the same time?  No.  I'm not asking that.  I just think it's wrong.  I just don't want to put any part of it.  I said I would paint my face and everything red.  Yeah.  Red represents anger.  The angry one, I'll do red.  I think I...  Ben said he would do black.  Yeah.  Ben even said that he will be painting himself black. 
[00:10:00]  What's the problem, Earl?  We're all equal in God's eyes.  And a lot of people are like, who's going to paint Earl Zambag?  No.  I mean, don't know how easy this is.  We even told them all we need is a white face, white bald head, and white hands.  White hands.  And white clothes.  That's all we need.  We don't need to paint your entire body white.  It'll give the illusion that you're completely white.  Yeah.  Everyone's saying you should go for it.  Look like that guy from Powder.  It'll be cool. 
[00:10:30]  Right?  What if we get Vinny the racist and we paint him black for the day?  That'll be good.  I just don't want...  I don't want to do it here.  I don't understand why you're so against this.  Don't worry, Earl.  I'll fight for your job in front of Ken Stevens.  Oh!  Oh, I will.  It doesn't matter.  I still respect you as a human being.  And when he asks us about what you're doing, no, we'll fight for your job. 
[00:11:00]  And your security around here, of course.  What's he going to pay?  You want a male prostitute thrown in?  We'll do that.  Little Asian kid?  Asian boy?  Nine-year-old with no teeth.  What else can we throw in?  I'm not going to do it.  Come on.  You'll just look like Michael Jackson when you're done.  No?  No.  No, don't worry.  After tonight, your feet will still work in our office door.  Of course it will.  Come on, Earl. 
[00:11:30]  What do you say?  You haven't explained why you wouldn't do this.  No, this is...  Guys, this is...  I think it's just wrong.  Can we get a black guy on the phone to explain why this is wrong?  Let me go to Felix.  Is everyone getting pissed now that you're not doing this?  Felix!  Yo!  Hey, Felix.  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  I just wanted to tell a black girl that painting a black guy white isn't a big deal.  It's not like you'll be teaching him how to read or getting him a job or anything.  Oh, see.  It really won't take. 
[00:12:00]  What's the big deal, Earl?  You know, just a little flash of color here.  Tell you what, they can paint me black and I'll go rob a store.  How about that?  That's exactly why I'm not doing it.  There you go.  Take it easy, guys.  Why?  By not doing it, you're feeding into these stereotypes.  That's right.  No, by not doing it, you're not.  You can show all these guys that you're a bigger man than them.  You're letting race play a part in this.  Right.  It has nothing to do with race.  Yeah, it has a little thing to do with it.  And you should.  Earl, it has nothing to do with race.  You have allowed us to call you Black Earl for the last three years. 
[00:12:30]  So why not call you White Earl for one afternoon?  What's the difference?  How about it?  Tommy!  What's going on, boys?  Hey.  I know how to get us to do it.  Yeah.  Throw in some KFC and a watermelon.  Stay out the bushes!  Why are you getting mad at that, Earl?  Gee, I wonder why.  What's so wrong if you say black people like fried chicken and watermelon?  Because not all black people like fried chicken and watermelon. 
[00:13:00]  Not all Irish people like to drink.  Exactly.  But it's funny when you throw that stereotype out there.  Why is it wrong?  I just think it's wrong.  I'm sorry.  Why is it wrong?  Can you explain why it's wrong?  If you're running around in white face, you don't think there's anything wrong with it?  No.  You're not going to be running around in white face.  How about if it's a closed set?  They do those things in the movies, Anthony.  Those closed sets.  Closed sets.  When someone has to do something a little awkward, a little different. 
[00:13:30]  Earl, what?  It's not like you're running for office.  I'm not saying that either.  I just think it's wrong.  I just don't want to be part of it.  You haven't explained why it's wrong.  That's a good explanation.  Why it's wrong.  You don't think there's anything wrong with a black guy running around in white face?  No.  Why?  You haven't explained why.  You have not explained yourself.  Here's black LJ.  LJ. 
[00:14:00]  LJ.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  You're on the radio.  I'm on?  Yeah.  Yeah, I just want to let you guys know.  You should be black.  I'll do it.  I don't care.  Yeah, it's all right.  So if you guys do it, Earl's having no problem with it.  Exactly.  But he does.  Earl, what's the problem?  Yeah, I'm black.  I just don't want to do it.  What?  I don't want to do it.  A lot of black guys checking in saying you should do it.  Nope.  What if Anthony and I will be black for a day?  Black in color, not black in, you know. 
[00:14:30]  Right.  Rodney.  Yeah, listen, Ope, if you guys are so high on this, and listen to Earl, if they say it's  not about race or anything, then if Ope's so high on this, why isn't Ope dressed up in  drag for a day and spend a day out at the office in drag?  He couldn't make an even season.  Because it has nothing to do with a clothing store.  We're trying to help out a paint store.  Well, so, hey, so let's just hang out.  Earl stands out there dressed as a white guy.  You just stand out there dressed as a chick. 
[00:15:00]  I think it, uh...  You shouldn't be dressed by that, right?  It's all in good fun.  I already said I would, uh, paint myself black.  Yeah, but he's not looking for you to paint him black.  I mean, I mean...  Rodney, what's the problem with Earl, uh, you know, painting in white?  Painting himself white and wearing white clothes for, like, three hours.  Because nobody laughs at white guys getting dressed up like black people or anything like  that.  No one, what?  What if I'm...  Nobody laughs at you because you're white dressed up as a black guy.  They think you're an a-hole if you're a black guy doing something like that. 
[00:15:30]  That's the whole point of the bit.  That's not the point of the bit.  The point of the bit is...  It wasn't the point of the bit.  You'd have a white guy putting on brown paint in front of you.  Rodney, we never...  You figured that would be bad, right?  Rodney, Rodney, we never said that it was going to be a white person applying the paint.  What if we get a black guy or a black girl...  What if we have a black girl putting the paint on?  What if we have a black girl putting the white paint on?  It is.  I mean, but if that was a joke, then you could have gotten any schmuck to go and do it.  But you want to get a black guy to dress up like a horse. 
[00:16:00]  You could have to be painted white.  No.  Why do you have to be painted white?  Why not just paint him red?  No, because he's not even going to look like a white guy.  It's returning black Earl into white Earl for an afternoon.  He's got a white T-shirt on, white pants, white face, white hands.  That's it.  Like stark white.  And you go all black, then, right?  What the hell?  I don't care.  All right, then.  All right.  I don't care.  All right, fine.  I think if you're willing to go that route, then Earl should do.  I'll make fun of myself because a lot of people say I have a lot of anger on this show. 
[00:16:30]  I'll just go all in red.  Yeah, I was going to say.  I'll go all in red.  You know, I know sometimes you don't like people going there with you.  You know, they start getting a little funny.  That's all I'm saying.  It's good for the goose.  It's good for the gander.  I'll paint myself whatever color Earl wants me to.  Earl, I think you're both.  As long as Opie gets done up first, go ahead and do it.  All right.  Thank you, Rodney.  All right.  Wouldn't be the first time someone on this show painted themselves black.  Right?  Like, I'd be willing to do it.  Earl. 
[00:17:00]  I'd paint myself black if Earl paints himself white.  You can pick a color.  I'll take any color.  I personally just don't know about it.  What if everyone in the studio right now is painted a color?  There you go.  I don't even care.  You can pick pink.  I don't give a crap.  I'll do it.  If that helps you out.  Oh, Earl.  I'm not offering this, but would you paint...  Would you let someone paint you green? 
[00:17:30]  No.  Why?  Why?  No.  No.  I just won't let you paint anything.  Why?  What's wrong with green?  It's not in them.  Red?  No.  Now it doesn't make sense.  What do you mean it doesn't make sense?  I just don't want any part of it.  At all.  You get a tenth of your yearly salary and a half hour Black Rock Coalition show.  We're giving you a lot.  Wow.  See?  Dude, I got arrested. 
[00:18:00]  You know, you got to get dressed up in white face, maybe?  Maybe do a little song and dance on the street?  Earl, you'll never understand...  That's the big deal.  You'll never understand our show.  It's too bad.  Yeah.  We kind of liked you.  Everyone in this room has taken one for the team.  In more ways than one.  You're driving a van.  It's not taking one for the team.  These guys were locked up for 28 hours for the show.  Earl, you'd be making a statement that color doesn't matter.  Doesn't even matter.  Right?  Right. 
[00:18:30]  There's photographic evidence of Anthony in Blackface.  Yep.  There you go.  Well, that Rod got seated.  Sure.  Nothing wrong with that.  Just like, thanks, James, but no thanks.  Hmm.  Interesting.  Right.  No, really.  I don't understand why.  Okay, I can justify why you pay Earl all that money.  No, really, Ted.  I think he deserves this. 
[00:19:00]  He's an important part of the team.  See the conversation with Ken tomorrow.  It's easy.  I'll help you out.  You're going to get a half hour of a Black Rock Coalition show?  How much that is worth?  I understand the stakes.  I just, you know what?  I just don't want to do it.  Earl comes into my studio almost every day and complains that he hasn't gotten a show yet.  And here you are giving him a half an hour.  Yeah. 
[00:19:30]  Half hour.  Of the very show he wants to do.  You could put on a demo reel and send out to somebody else if you wanted to.  Earl, because if you ever did get your Black Rock Coalition show, you know, let's not make any mistakes here.  It would be on like in the middle of the night or like at five in the morning on a Sunday.  We're giving you prime real estate.  Right there.  A half hour show.  Prime time.  Prime time.  You can even say what day you want to do it so you can call everyone you know.  You can call record companies, program directors, whatever.  That's huge. 
[00:20:00]  There you go.  No, I understand the stakes.  And you don't even have to do it in Whiteface.  No, just like, not at that price.  No.  At that price?  What's the price?  There's no price.  Phew.  All right, Earl.  Thanks.  Thanks for helping us out again.  Sorry, guys.  Well, whatever. 
[00:20:30]  Thanks.  Thanks.  Thanks.  Thanks, man.  Even if we throw in the Asian boy.  What is in the deal with the Asian boy?  No.  No.  Male prostitute?  No.  Lifetime membership to Chippendales?  No.  What if we all wanted to dress up like Martians in here and we all had to paint ourselves green? 
[00:21:00]  Would you do it?  No.  Why?  What if we give you rupees before?  So you can tell everyone, look, I don't know what's going on.  I was drinking some iced tea.  Next thing I know, I woke up with, you know, a white face.  Then you'd have an excuse.  No.  Hey, hey, Ian.  I don't know.  Don't waste our time, then.  We've got a show to do.  You asked me.  I was...  All right. 
[00:21:30]  Thanks, Earl.  Sure.  Definitely very valuable to the team.  Bye-bye.  Goodbye.  You are the weakest link.  Goodbye.  Here he goes.  The Herb Williams of the O&S show.  Oh.  Well, he's important to the Knicks.  One of those guys who wonder why they kept him for so long. 
[00:22:00]  He is the cockroach around that, Andy W.  He just happens to live on.  Look at all these black guys.  I'm black, I'll do it.  How much?  I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it.  Look.  Dylan.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Are you really black?  Yeah, black.  Hey, uh, Martin Martian thinks he was melting.  Why?  He had diarrhea.  You're not black.  Yes, I am.  I'm seriously black.  I'm not joking.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  That's just a joke, man. 
[00:22:30]  I'm black.  All right, Dylan.  Thank you.  No, no, no, it's mine.  What's this?  I think just opened the door and whispered, so...  He is.  Oh, that guy was black?  Yeah.  Oh, well.  I don't believe it.  All right, Anthony, we've got to take a break.  All right.  Jay Moore killed on Regis and Kelly this morning.  Yes, Regis and Kelly.  He was standing in for Regis.  And we got some great clips from the show.  We want to talk about it, so stick around for that, okay?  Yeah.  And, uh, clear the phone line, Stinky.  No more, Earl.

On Saturday evening, David Spade brought a few pals to see Meet Joe Dirt at the Beverly 
[00:24:30]  Connection in Los Angeles.  All was well until midway through the picture when Spade and company got up out of their seats  and headed out into the night.  Our source laughs it was that bad.  He didn't sit through his own movie.  With his friends.  He probably brought his friends going, hey man, this is, you know, it's a really good movie.  I'm pretty proud of it.  And they were probably sitting there and he was probably getting all uncomfortable because  his friends just flat out weren't laughing and he couldn't take it anymore.  He said, well, guys, why don't we get out of here and I'll buy some lap dances for everybody.

[00:27:30]  Make a chicken man at home.  Make a chicken man at home.  Bag.  Very funny.  Jesus Christ.  This is despicable.  Harry Sack with you.  I like doing oral on my dog.  I just want an erection so I can give it to my mom.  I got 102, 377.  And it is.  I have a double year.  That's twisted.  Thank you, Drew Boogie, for that.  Yeah.  Drew Boogie, give us a call, by the way. 
[00:28:00]  Dice, Dice, baby.  Yeah.  Dice loved that so much that he wants to talk to Drew Boogie about putting together an intro for his concerts.  There's something together.  He did start a show at Westbury with that.  Yeah, he did.  And then he walked out.  We didn't even bring up the fact that he just blatantly, you know, I'm not one for ripping me off or saying anything like that.  Believe me.  I understand comedy.  I understand a lot of things are funny to a lot of people. 
[00:28:30]  And a lot of comedians or people on the radio, they pick up on it and put their own spin on it.  So if you're talking about a certain TV show and find certain things in it funny, just because you do it doesn't mean someone's ripping you off if they do it.  But Dice did the Lost in Space bit that I did a while back about Dr. Smith and young William.  Right.  And how he's banging young William.  Yeah.  And the fact that Major West was the navigator on the ship on the Jupiter 2. 
[00:29:00]  And he was banging the big blonde bombshell.  Judy.  And they were purposely getting lost so he could, you know, bang the blonde.  The hot blonde.  He's got it now.  Right.  But Dice did the same bit.  At Westbury Music Fair.  The whole thing talking about, and the pilot, that Frankie Avalon looking guy with the blonde.  Right.  And there's Dr. Smith, the pedophile, with William behind the rock. 
[00:29:30]  I think you're pissed off because he butchered your bit.  Yeah, he really butchered it.  Like, well, but it was funny in its own right because he didn't know, he didn't really know the, he didn't even really know the show, quite frankly.  No, no, no.  And he didn't know the characters and what their names were.  So he was, like, saying, like, the little boy and the pilot.  And the little boy and the blonde.  Right.  They go behind a rock.  Yeah.  And no wonder he's the pilot.  He's lost. 
[00:30:00]  He just wants to bang the chick.  The blonde chick with the boom.  At that point, Opie, like, leans forward because Sandy was sitting between us, leans forward so I can see him, turns his head to me, and just makes his face like, ooh, ooh.  Well, we both did it at the same time.  Not knowing what the other guy was doing, we both, at the same time, leaned forward and looked at each other.  And looked like, okay, it's not just me.  Right.  But I was a little too close.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  But it was still fun.  Yeah.  Man.  A little borrowing going on, I guess. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, wait, but I've learned from comedians, Anthony.  What?  But, hey, he's a great guy.  Hey, he's a great guy, though.  You know, we all get along.  We love him.  It doesn't matter what you say.  So you can do that if you're hanging with other comedians.  You can trash him, but just say, oh, I'm just kidding.  I love the guy.  The guy's such a hack.  It's horrible.  He's a gag, I think.  He smells.  He's got bad breath.  He's a kid touching.  The guy's great.  Yeah, I love him.  Yeah, we love him, bro.  212-757-1027.  Carolyn, what's going on? 
[00:31:00]  Hey, I saw Jay Moore this morning, and he was mentioning Jim Rome as much as he was mentioning  you guys, so I was wondering what his little phrase is for, okay, terrific for you, what  his phrase is for those guys.  Yeah, that would be a good question to ask Jay next time he's on, because he is very good  friends with Jim Rome.  And I also wanted to know what you were just saying about the comedians insulting them  one minute and saying they're great.  He had that whole Carrot Top thing.  That might be an interesting question, too.  I think Jay was put in a bad position, because if we know Jay, he doesn't like Carrot Top. 
[00:31:30]  Come on.  Yes, just stop.  I can't speak for Jay, but I would assume that he thinks that type of humor is kind  of silly and stupid.  Yeah.  He just kept saying he's a really hard-working comedian.  He works really hard.  Yeah, when you're a comic like Jay, and you come up with these observations and make them  really funny, and you're working to be clever, and you see a Carrot Top wheels out, you know,  a toilet seat with handlebars or something. 
[00:32:00]  You're like four giant trunks full of comedy.  Yeah, full of comedy, you call them?  Most comedians, and I don't have to speak for them, they'll call on their own and tell  you, they hate prop comics.  Prop comics are hacks.  Examples of prop comics, Carrot Top and Gallagher.  Carrot Top, Gallagher, prop comic, you know?  And he's got some really scary drawn-on eyebrows, too.  They're very, very frightening.  It's a whole, it's a makeup, like the guy's wearing a ton of makeup, Carrot Top. 
[00:32:30]  Carrot Top.  Just say it, it sounds so stupid.  All right, Carolyn, thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  Carolyn Top.  But it should be said that Jay Moore killed this morning.  Yeah.  Killed.  Did a good job, and he was, it was cool because he was himself.  Right.  He didn't try to come off like Regis, or come off like a talk show.  He was just being himself, and it was really funny.  Because there was, sometimes he was getting tripped up, and sometimes his jokes aren't  flying, but just like Jay, when it happens, he has an answer for that. 
[00:33:00]  Right.  You know?  Well, we got some, we got some clips from Jay Moore on Regis and Kelly this morning,  of course, filling in for...  Don't call him a moron.  For Regis.  Oh, Jay Moore on.  Okay, sorry, I was confused.  Here's Jay talking about Al Green.  We hired a car in New Orleans, and we drove all the way through up to New York.  We saw Al Green preach in his church.  Oh, my gosh.  Al Green, the Reverend.  Yeah, the Reverend Al.  Wow.  That's my man. 
[00:33:30]  The most charismatic man I've ever witnessed.  Yeah, he was amazing.  He was amazing.  And you went to Graceland.  We did.  Did somebody do that already, the Al Green impression?  No.  That was a quick, that was a very good...  Well, tell your face.  What?  I'm trying to get to the bottom of her trip.  I'm all you want.  I know, but I, I, I...  You know what I want to know about?  I think I just had a stroke.  When he goes, tell your face, because, yeah, he was doing his Al Green impression, and Kelly  goes, wow, that's very good. 
[00:34:00]  And he goes, tell your face.  Yeah, well, tell your face.  Because she wasn't reacting at all.  She didn't laugh.  That's a great line.  Tell your face.  I got to remember that line.  No, that's funny.  Well, tell your face.  That is so damn good.  Let's go to Jay.  Another Jay.  Jay, what's up?  Yo, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Yo, I was home from work today.  I'm sick, allegedly.  And I was watching Jay Moore on Regis this morning.  Oh, my God.  The best part was at the end. 
[00:34:30]  You know, when they're in commercial, he must have told her, get these plugs in for me.  Yeah.  They come back.  Kelly Ripa goes, and Jay Moore will be appearing at Caroline's Thursday through Sunday, and you  can hear him on the Jay Moore show, on the Opie and Anthony show on 1027 WNEW this afternoon.  I was dying.  It was hysterical.  You know, Jay's a stand-up guy, man.  Oh, yeah.  That is so cool.  That is so cool.  You know that he's the only person that's going to go out there and do that for you guys.  He is the best, hands down.  Right on, man.  Thanks, Jay. 
[00:35:00]  Later.  I think this is it.  Kelly Ripa.  I want to thank Jay Moore, who will be at Caroline's tonight.  And you can listen to him on the Opie and Anthony show, 1027 in the New York metro area.  No one can get our name right the first time.  Everyone has a hard time.  The Opie and Anthony.  How many times have we heard that?  On the Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  A lot of people think my name is Opie and Anthony.  And you're Anthony.  Anthony, me.  Hey, Opie and Anthony, where's Anthony?  Opus.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:35:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Chris, what's up?  Yeah, what's going on?  I just like that he didn't have the same sentiments as you, but he did bring up the belly button.  Oh, Kelly Ripa.  I'm glad he did that.  Yeah.  Because we've been talking about her belly button for a long time on this show.  Yeah.  Popping out there.  Yeah, he made a little reference, a cute reference.  It would have been nice if you said it was a little disturbing.  No, it was, what did he say?  Her belly button looks like the pop-up timer on the turkey.  Yeah, it's like it's done. 
[00:36:00]  Right.  And she's like, no, it's got to, you know, what?  It's got to bake a little longer or whatever he said.  Yeah.  Or she said.  So, cool.  All right, opening an ante.  All right, Chris.  I'll see you later.  Bye.  The Amazing Jonathan is not a prop comic.  I wouldn't consider him a prop comic because he's a comic magician.  And I think he's very fun.  The Amazing Jonathan.  So don't put him in there.  Yeah, you ever see him?  Yeah, he's great.  He was awful.  Really?  Yeah, we blew him off for some reason. 
[00:36:30]  Wow, he's really good.  Yeah.  Because I think he's hilarious.  And I was like, oh, I'm not going to bring him.  Because all I'm going to get is, why would you bring this guy to us?  Because I've heard that before from some others.  No, we would definitely check out the Amazing Jonathan.  He's funny, yeah.  Next time he's around, he's in.  Wait, you just offered us Gallagher, didn't you?  Yeah, what are you insane?  What are you talking about?  You just said, you guys want Gallagher?  Yesterday, I think you said, guys, you want Gallagher on the show?  And is it Gallagher or his brother that goes around as Gallagher 2? 
[00:37:00]  I was being nice because Matt DeVote was pitching him.  Oh.  Hey, you want Gallagher?  No, Matt.  Thanks.  That's okay.  DeVote.  Working on it.  We got more clips of Jay Moore on Regis and Kelly this morning.  Yeah.  You said the exact wrong thing.  I had just met him three seconds ago.  Three seconds ago.  Hi, Kelly, I'm Jay.  My God, you're huge.  No, because I thought, you never know.  Maybe she has a quintuplets and maybe no one knows that except me. 
[00:37:30]  Like, that's the big secret she has, that she has five children.  No, keep going.  No, keep going.  Miss Quinn, you look fantastic.  Oh, stop it.  You're beautiful.  And I think your looks are probably the least of your qualities.  Oh.  Oh, what a pimp hand.  Oh, my God.  You're beautiful.  And I think your looks are the least of your qualities.  Oh.  Oh, God.  Now, what are we going to do about this? 
[00:38:00]  Jim, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, were you uncomfortable after Ripa gave that plug for you and Opie, and about a month  ago, you're suing a bit about giving an abortion with a rustic hanger?  Yes, man.  That was so funny, man.  It's kind of weird how things work out, man.  That was boring.  That was a little strange, yeah, when you hear the name.  Take care, guys.  It was like, get me the hanger.  I can't take these women talking about their children.  I can't take these women talking about their children, but I can't take these women talking 
[00:38:30]  about their children.  I want to play that bit, but it's really long.  Can we get maybe a piece of it?  Maybe we can find a good section that we can play?  Where, yes, I wanted to abort the fetus.  Abort it, Kelman.  You're probably listening to us today.  Hi, Kelly.  No.  More audio from Jay Moore.  Stunning character.  From this morning.  Once again, I've got to say, the man killed this morning.  Very funny stuff.  That's not the beauty. 
[00:39:00]  Now, here are Kelly Ripa and Jay Moore.  Tony Pigg.  Hi, everyone.  Hey.  I'm sorry.  Please, sit down.  I just swallowed my chewing gum.  Good morning, everyone.  It is Thursday, April 19th, 2001.  Please welcome the one and only Jay Moore.  Thank you very much.  I've got it.  Let's be all Jay, terrific.  Oh.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[00:39:30]  You know what?  He is the best.  He is the best at getting stuff in like that.  It always sounds a little awkward, though, you know?  But it's cool.  But it's cool that he does it.  It's like a challenge.  Okay.  Terrific.  Right off the bat, Martin.  He did some, uh, Ralphie boy.  Darren, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Good.  You guys are here to comment Dean Cook?  Faggot.  Faggot?  He's so funny. 
[00:40:00]  Faggot.  We had Dean Cook on our show in Boston.  He is a very, very funny comedian, but he doesn't like us.  I don't think he likes us.  Really?  He's a little rough for the radio because he's very animated.  Yeah, but it just seemed like he just didn't like us as people,  which is always not a good thing when you're trying to have fun with a comedian.  Didn't he say something about us, too?  No, no.  There was something said like...  No, Anthony Clark has talked bad about us, but I don't think Dean Cook ever did.  Like, yeah, I've heard their show.  No, he said something like that, like, I've heard their show. 
[00:40:30]  When we were backstage?  Yeah.  At the Comedy Connection in Boston?  Yeah.  When we met him and he gave us a big blow-off?  It was like, hey, what's up?  Opie and Anthony goes, yeah, I've heard your show.  Yeah.  And then it was like, that's it.  Like, he was pissed.  Oh, what a dick.  He was pissed at something he heard.  You know what?  But he's still a funny guy.  What can I tell you?  I mean, you know, we're not going to get along with everyone.  We all know that, so...  Yeah, he still makes me laugh.  All right, Darren.  All right, later.  Bye.  Bye.  I think Anthony Clark, we should give him another shot. 
[00:41:00]  He hated us in Boston.  Yeah.  Ben knows for a fact he hated us.  I think we were...  And we ran into him backstage in Boston, and I got it right.  He was cool to us that day.  Yeah.  I think we were labeled homophobic up in Boston.  Yeah.  Well, the guy that we were up against at BCN at the time was, um...  Well, he was a homo.  Homosexual.  And, uh...  We kind of beat on him pretty hard. 
[00:41:30]  Seems to be a lot of gay guys on radio, Anthony.  I know.  Go figure that one out.  What would think?  Most of them not willing to come out of the closet for some reason.  Well, it's bad for the image.  You know, the guy up in Boston didn't want to do it either.  And, uh, you know, when you're dropping carts so your young boy interns can bend over and  pick them up, it's kind of hard to hide the fact that, uh...  Hey, hey!  Wait, Ben's going to talk today?  What are you in here with?  Ben was one of those guys, you know?  I know.  Ben's been in radio since he was, like, what, 14? 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  They called him the rear admiral.  Rear admiral.  The rear admiral.  I had a lot of friends that weren't there.  My friend Decker started interning there.  He's, like, Parenteau's a big guy.  He's, like, 6'4".  I like the tall.  Okay.  So, anyways, he sees my friend.  He goes, hey, go over there and pick up that case of soda on the ground.  He goes over and picks up a case of soda.  He's staring at his ass with a big smile on his face going, hey, hey!  Hold it.  Isn't this the same guy that gave Mark that name? 
[00:42:30]  What?  Pickle Boy Jones.  No, yeah, yeah.  He gave Psycho Mark Pickle Boy Jones.  And don't even ask me what that's about, because that's a whole other candle mark.  And Mark refuses to talk about it.  Mark will never talk about it.  And then, a couple years ago, I ran into Parenteau again at the Pearl Jam show here at the garden.  And I sit down with my friend Decker again.  I smell the stanchion colones.  Hey, man, what's going on?  Who's your friend?  And he's got this, like, 14-year-old kid.  He goes, Mark, these are great seats.  Swear to God, it's all true. 
[00:43:00]  That's great.  He brought a little boy with him.  Oh, dude, this kid was, like, 15.  He's so excited.  He's like, these seats are amazing.  Eddie Fender's my favorite.  Wait till you sit on your other seat.  My face.  We had an insane radio battle with him when we were working in Boston.  Yeah.  And, you know, it's got to be said, too, we finally met him.  Of all places, at a John Mellencamp show when we were in hell when we first got to NAW  and had to make believe we cared about those shows when we went to them. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, he was...  And he was there, and he was really, really cool to us.  Yeah.  Really cool to us.  Well, it was, you know, when you get into battle sometimes, you really, and especially  us, we pull out all the stops and just go for the jugular, and it was so obvious, and  everyone in Boston knew, but no one talked about it.  So we just got on and talked about it, and we got labeled, you know, homophobic, so then  a lot of the comics that were gay or other acts that were gay wouldn't want to come on  the show, and they hated us because they thought we were gay bashing. 
[00:44:00]  Or gay managers that represented huge rock bands.  Oh, my God.  That's real.  That was when it was real crazy.  Yeah.  Forgot about that, remember?  You guys will never play their records again.  You'll never get anything from them.  That got real ugly.  You don't even know the others.  Let me tell you something, and we say it from time to time.  We don't like to brag, but Opie and Anthony always, always, always win in the end.  Yeah.  Because you're bringing up a good point.  This person, I don't even want to name the band. 
[00:44:30]  And I won't name the guy.  But it's just, it's one of the biggest bands ever.  Absolutely.  If you're smart, you can figure it out in your head, okay?  And because we were labeled this homophobe thing, this guy said, you will never, you  will never talk to my band.  You'll never get concerts to see this band.  You will not get the record first.  I mean, nothing.  We were going to be shut out from everything, okay?  He wanted to go as far as to take his record company and screw AAF from ever getting the 
[00:45:00]  records from anyone on that label, which is a humongous label.  He was so pissed at you guys.  Yeah.  No, it's not GWAR, Rick.  Hey, we like GWAR.  We might do something with those guys.  So, just quickly.  So, we fast forward, less than a year, right, Anthony?  Yeah.  Who's in our studio but this band?  Yeah.  This band.  For like the whole show, saying how cool we were and thanks for the support and this 
[00:45:30]  and that, blah, blah, blah.  I sent this in a few months ago.  My friend met Dane Cook, said to him, you should give O&A a call.  They have a lot of great comedians on the show.  He replied, yeah.  Why don't you ask them yourself?  Yeah, he doesn't like us.  That's all right.  And no, George isn't a prop.  No, I know.  I didn't want to put Otto and George in the prop comic.  Is it a prop or not? 
[00:46:00]  Not at all.  Puppet.  Not at all.  Different.  That's a whole different category.  I am not a prop, you whore.  Look my starfish.  He's in the ventriloquist.  Was that a stinky Dice impression?  Tony.  Yo, what's up?  Hey.  You're not gay?  No.  I'm sorry.  All right.  Yo, what do you guys have on Jay Moore?  He'll do anything for you guys.  How did you get him in your pocket like that?  He's pals.  He's a friend.  Yeah. 
[00:46:30]  Friends do that.  Special friends.  We help him.  He helps us.  All right.  I think he gets a kick out of doing it for us, too.  No, his last appearance yesterday, he was so funny.  It was the best appearance in a long time.  Yeah, he killed.  He ruled.  Rock!  The tickets for Carolines are going fast.  I don't even know what's available still.  We're all going tonight, I believe.  So we'll see you guys down there.  More audio from this morning?  All right.  Jay and Kelly Ripa.  Sorry to say you're in the mummy.  That's what he's meaning to turn. 
[00:47:00]  The mummy.  She was in both.  The mummy was one of the biggest grossing...  Three hundred and eighty million dollars.  That means if you had a million dollars, you're still three hundred and seventy nine million  short.  Or you say something.  This is not working for me.  That's great.  I love it.  It's like, you know, he's riffing.  He's riffing.  Riffing?  I went right through, Don. 
[00:47:30]  You got to the pause list.  Right through, Don.  Yeah, to the honeymooners.  That was the punchline of one of the jokes.  But yeah, doing the honeymooners.  Stan, he knows it gets me every time.  Let's see.  Let's go to another Tony.  This has got to be our favorite Tony.  Tony, what's up?  What's up, fellas?  Hey, man.  Hey, boy.  Hey, no.  Tony, do you hear me on any shows today?  Ed, no.  I don't care if you're on the show.  Ed, no.  You guys are my favorite.  You know that.  All right, boy.  All right, dude. 
[00:48:00]  How do we do that for Ron and Fez?  All right, man.  What's wrong with Ron and Fez?  I love Ron and Fez, too, but you're my favorite.  Ron and Fez beat up a retarded girl today.  I know, dude.  We caught that.  She had to be a fat-ass, huge witch.  She wasn't a witch.  She was retarded.  She didn't catch the friggin' South Park bus driver reference.  She didn't know where she was, Tony.  That's what made her so wrong.  She's a retard.  I don't care.  Anyway.  And she wasn't even retarded enough to fight like a retard.  Yeah, that could have put her over the top.  He doesn't get it.  He just thinks she's retarded. 
[00:48:30]  No.  I get it.  Duh, Rick, you right head.  Shut up.  Oh, God.  Jackass.  Look who's talking.  He ain't all right.  Anyway, Jay Moore working the pimp hand.  You catch the Jungle Fever reference?  He threw it out of Bella Sciorra.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I saw that.  Funny guy, man.  He is.  He did a great job.  Her finally refreshing to hear him give somebody else a plug other than himself.  Very good.  Heels the roids, Rick. 
[00:49:00]  All right.  You got me.  You know, though, one Jay Moore plug on Regis and Kelly is worth Jay promoting himself  a thousand times on our radio show.  Absolutely.  So, Jay Moore, my friend, we are even.  Mr. X checking in.  What about Jeff Norris?  Ain't he a prop comic and a hack?  No.  Jeff is not a prop comic.  I love the guy.  Shut up.  Right.  He's one of our faves.  Yeah.  One of our first guests ever. 
[00:49:30]  Right.  All right.  I've been, I was on the radio yesterday here in New York on Opie and Anthony, which is  a local guys that are friends of mine and Jim Rome in Los Angeles, which is a great radio  show.  Wait.  So we're just friends of his and Jim Rome's a great radio guy.  Great radio guy.  Oh, good.  Good.  Look, he can do no right.  Like, see how we look into stuff way too much?  Yeah.  Wait.  So we're just friends and friends and Rome is a great radio guy.  A couple of local guys too, which means, you know, we'll be local forever. 
[00:50:00]  Shahid.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, I'm reading Star Magazine right now.  Brother Weeds has a mention at the end.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Talking about, what's his name?  Uncle Junior, Sopranos, being gay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think Weeds was talking about that on the radio this past Saturday night.  Uncle Junior, gay?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Dominic Chenise, gay.  Oh, the guy that plays him? 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  Oh, I was going to say the character.  And what, it made Star Magazine?  Yep.  Right at the end.  The last page.  I see.  Oh, can we get Brother Weeds on the phone today?  Another quick thing.  Why isn't Brother Weeds on instead of the radio chick?  Oh, you're going to get us in trouble, bro.  I'm sorry.  But the radio chick, the rest of the show is suck on that station, except for Ron and Fez.  Huh?  We love Brother Weeds.  Let's just put it that way.  Yeah.  He's good.  I would love to see something happen with that.  All right, boys.  Thanks, Shahid.  Yep.  Hey, but that was in Star Magazine?  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We got to get Brother Weeds on the phone, because that was a huge scoop. 
[00:51:00]  I think he had someone from The Sopranos on, or somebody that knew, and just flat out  said that Junior's gay.  Junior's gay.  I'm gay, Tony.  All right.  We'll take a break.  We'll get Brother Weeds on, hopefully, if we can hunt him down.  Also, more Jay Moore clips from Regis and Kelly.  Yeah.  Some more good stuff on the way.  212-757-1027.

What do you got over there, Ed? 
[00:53:00]  Well, it's the Star Magazine.  Is TV mob tough gay?  You know, a tough guy?  Tough gay.  What?  Junior Soprano gay in real life?  No way, Jose.  That's what Dominic Chiniti, 70, Tony's crown of sourpuss uncle on this show,  has been telling folks after a caller on Rochester, New York's WCMF radio,  claimed during a live interview of Chinis, that he was gay. 
[00:53:30]  He kind of avoided the issue, but his handle has went off on us after the show swearing he wasn't,  said, CMF jock, brother wheeze.  Oh.  I'm gay, Tony.  I got the big casino, and I'm gay.  We're trying to get wheeze on the...  I like getting butt slammed, Tony.  Jesus. 
[00:54:00]  Trying to get wheeze on the line to see how that all went down.  God, it's not ass cancer.  I can't take ass cancer, Tony.  I need my gay sex.  Stomach cancer, doesn't it?  Stomach cancer.  Too many hot protein shakes, Tony.  You're a fag?  I'm a faggot, Tony.  Well, he says it's not true, Anthony. 
[00:54:30]  Yes, he says it's not true.  Very important that we go on record to say that.  That's what Star Magazine is reporting, right?  Faggala, Tony.  We have more audio from Jay Moore in a minute here.  Yeah.  But first, remember yesterday?  Tony, I'm a Twinkie.  I'm head of this family, and I'm a faggot.  I'm a rope swallow.  Rope swallow of Tony.  Remember Kelly from yesterday?  Oh, yeah.  Little teenage girl showing us her boobs. 
[00:55:00]  18.  She was being filled up by Jay Moore yesterday in front of her boyfriend.  Yeah.  And then we all danced.  Then we danced.  She's on the phone and says she got in trouble yesterday.  What happened?  Kelly.  Hey.  What's wrong, Kelly?  Oh, God.  John's dad was listening.  Yeah.  And, like, screamed at me.  Why?  Because that's bad.  Well, because he wanted to fill you up.  I feel like such trash.  Oh, God.  So your boyfriend's father was listening, and he's not happy? 
[00:55:30]  No.  But you got filled up by a movie star.  No.  But today, today, all these girls at school were like, why are you wearing a wow shirt?  You're not a guy.  And I'm like, it's like the coolest thing, blah, blah, blah.  They're like, ew.  It puts it all in perspective, doesn't it?  Do you believe that?  You're going to school.  Wasn't that horrible?  I think your boyfriend's dad wants you.  No.  Don't say that.  He's probably listening.  Stop it.  It's upsetting to him that you are getting felt up by Jay Moore. 
[00:56:00]  No.  Stop saying that.  And he's showing your lovely breasts to all of us because he doesn't see him, and he doesn't  get to touch him.  No.  No.  Stop saying that.  He's probably listening right now.  He's secretly, yeah.  I am such trash.  I feel so horrible.  Oh, stop.  No, you're not.  Yes, I am.  What a beautiful thing.  A girl that comes in with her boyfriend and gets felt up by a movie star in front of him,  I wouldn't call that white trash.  No.  If you, you know, if you hob the knob, then I would have to put you in the white trash 
[00:56:30]  category.  Maybe if you were a fag, Tony.  I'm a fag.  I don't know.  What, Psycho Mark?  You're a filthy whore.  Oh.  All right, Kelly.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  There goes Kelly from yesterday.  Emily.  Hey, would the shaky hands of Louis Black be considered props?  Louis' shaky hands.  It's so distracting.  He should be juggling something. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, Louis is up to some kind of comedy award, so we want our listeners to vote for Louis  Black.  Yeah, he's great.  I voted.  What website?  No, you've got to do it by phone, I think.  I think you might do it by website, but it's Comedy Central.  Oh, go to Comedy Central's website.  I'm sure they'll have the details on how you can make Louis Black win this award.  Bye, guys.  Thank you, Emily.  Bye.  Bye.  Let's go to Dylan.  Dylan.  Hey, would Geneva Ruffles' sketch pad sing be a prop?  Yeah, her little notepad.  That's her prop.  Sure, why not?  That's her prop.  She's a hack. 
[00:57:30]  Thanks, Dylan.  In the coffin.  Let's go to Ryan.  Ryan, what's going on?  What's going on, Oda?  Hey.  Listen, Dominic Cheney is definitely not a guy.  My father's on the show.  I went out to dinner with him a couple of times, and he has a girlfriend for a pretty  long time.  I just went for you.  Ryan, you're cute.  Tony.  Tony, I'm a fag.  Hey, who's your dad on the show?  My father plays Johnny Sack.  He's a New York boss.  Oh, really?  That's your father?  Yeah.  That's my pops, man.  The New York boss. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  He's pretty cool.  That's right.  Wow, another Sopranos interview we're getting here.  The son of the guy that plays the New York boss.  Nice.  I mean, I almost thought it was that cool, man.  All right, Ryan.  All right, ladies and gentlemen.  Hey, put your dad on the phone.  I'm actually, he's at work right now.  I work with him, so he's not around right now.  What does he do?  Uh, well, when he doesn't act, we're a contract in New Jersey.  He's not really acting.  Well, he's my boss.  He sits home and acts while I work.  I thought he was a great actor. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  He's just, you know, living his life on HBO.  Well, it's just me.  I don't know.  I guess I'm pretty much his bitch.  All right, Ryan.  All right, man.  Thank you.  Later.  Bye.  Remember Junior's quote last year?  I have fed so far up my ass, I could taste brew cream.  Full new meaning now, huh?  From Big Al.  Well, possibly.  All right.  Uh, uh.  Junior's taking it.  Well, that's a star magazine. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  He's reporting, and we don't know for sure, Anthony.  Richard Pryor's wheelchair, prop?  No.  I would say no.  All right, we got more clips from, uh, Jay Moore on Kelly and, uh, Regis this morning,  or Regis and Kelly.  Yeah, exactly.  Jay co-hosting.  Sure.  Giving us props.  Mm-hmm.  Big time.  We greatly appreciate that.  Yeah.  Uh, here's some more, some more audio from, uh, this morning.  This is so much fun.  Well, you're a, I mean, you really are a multi-talented guy.  You've got your own radio show. 
[00:59:30]  Probably a star.  You've, you're.  Wow.  He does?  He didn't even correct her.  No, he didn't.  I'm on some, uh, high-profile radio shows.  Yeah.  This is so much fun.  Well, you're a, I mean, you really are a multi-talented guy.  You've got your own radio show.  Both stars.  You've, you're an actor, and now, tonight, you're appearing at Caroline's?  I'm at Caroline's, uh, Comedy Club.  It's very fun, thank you.  I've been doing all the radio, a lot of promotion.  I don't need to promote it here, but that's very nice of you. 
[01:00:00]  No, I'm, I'm, I'm coming.  You should come by.  Can I?  Just don't give birth in the middle of the show, because I don't know how to follow that.  Very nice.  More Jay Moore from this morning.  And you're, and you're in the middle of moving to Texas?  Yes.  Why are you moving to Texas?  For warmer weather.  For warmer weather.  Uh, you know, Florida's also warm, and so is Hawaii.  So, I hear, uh, Ecuador. 
[01:00:30]  Because it's by the equator, so it's called Ecuador.  Like equator.  Is that true?  Yeah.  I had no idea.  Africa's hot also.  Okay, well, listen, Heather.  Oh!  Kelly should have just said, moving right along.  White shorts.  Ouch.  You know what, uh, it reminds me of every time I hear Kelly Ripa, though?  You know that bit with Sherry O'Terry and Will Ferrell when they do the, um, the talk show host?  Yeah!  Yeah!  It was hot! 
[01:01:00]  Wasn't it hot?  Yeah!  Yeah!  Just all contorted on the couch.  That was awesome.  Over the top.  That bit was awesome.  That bit was awesome.  Yeah, crazy awesome.  Here's some more.  Look at the chemistry, gentlemen.  Get the Regis guy out of here.  Look at the artist saying, the artist saying.  What kind of name is Regis?  Korean?  What is Regis?  It is Korean.  Is his brother Casey Kasem?  Irish.  It's Irish.  It is Irish.  For king.  For king.  King.  Royal.  And the Regis.  Royal.  Everybody tunes into the Regis and the Kelly Ripa. 
[01:01:30]  Okay, now.  Oh, my.  I knocked over everything.  I knocked over everything?  Yeah.  Spilled some coffee and...  I got to see that.  Yeah, you didn't get to see the video.  No.  You were just listening to the audio portion.  I almost was able to watch it this morning, but I played Rockstar in my hotel room last  night.  After the gig?  After the gig.  The Novotel.  And I wanted to watch a movie.  You know?  So we rent one of those... 
[01:02:00]  Well, it should be said.  After the show, we all went to...  What was the name of the place?  Bar 9?  Yeah.  After yesterday's show, we all went to Bar 9.  Great place.  I had a blast.  Right.  Just like shot after shot.  I'm drinking gold slugger.  I hate that stuff, but people hand it to you.  What are you going to do?  Dude, woof it.  Pussy.  All right.  Peer pressure.  I'm...  I'm...  I'm biting.  I'm there.  Yeah.  So I went back to the hotel, and I want to rent a movie on this bank revision.  20 minutes into the movie. 
[01:02:30]  Gone.  Son of a bitch.  I called the front desk.  You got to hook me up here with this movie.  Oh, well, just reorder it, and we'll refund you so you don't get charged.  Because...  Turn it on again.  20 minutes into it again, because you've got to watch the same thing you just watched.  Dead again.  I did a clean sweep of the whole friggin' tabletop that the TV was on.  Glam. 
[01:03:00]  Vroom!  All over the floor.  Mother effer!  We're going to sleep!  Then I did two lines of coke, and I was...  No.  Teasing.  You were riding your motorcycle up and down the hallway?  I was like a rock.  I was Chief Moon last night.  So then I wake up this morning, and I'm like, oh, God, what time is it?  Oh, it's a quarter after nine.  I catch Jay.  I look up, and there's the TV on the floor.  Sideways.  Screw it.  I can't get out of bed and pick it up. 
[01:03:30]  So I missed it.  That's why I missed watching Jay this morning.  You missed some good stuff.  I was playing Keith Moon in the hotel room.  Let's go to Rodney.  He has a question.  Rodney!  Hey.  Rodney.  Yeah, what's up, Ian?  I wonder if you ever got that red-headed slut you were looking for last night.  The red-headed slut?  No, I never got one of those.  I've got plenty of other stuff.  Yeah, I was asking for a red-headed slut, which is a shot open.  Right.  It's a Jägermeister.  It's a peach schnapps.  And then cranberry juice in a shot. 
[01:04:00]  And it's really good, but people decided that they weren't going to give me that.  Just had to have the gold slug.  And then there was another shot that I don't even know what the hell it was, but it was high  octane, and it was in these huge shot glasses.  And, you know, when you go and shot with the likes of Lynch and his crowd, Stephen Lynch  was there.  Stephen Lynch and his boys, that son of a bitch can drink.  And, you know, Cowbell Bill, who can drink.  My brother, Cowbell Bill's no slouch.  Everybody was just pounding him last night. 
[01:04:30]  It was disgusting.  It was a rough, it was really rough making that meeting we had today.  At like 11 o'clock, I strolled in at like 10.59.  All right, we have two more clips from Jay Moore from this morning, Anthony.  Here we go.  You know, I always see you on television.  You're twice as beautiful in real life as you are on TV.  Do you notice whenever he is stupefied by me, he says,  You're pretty. 
[01:05:00]  I think, excuse me, but I think there's a lesson to be learned there, gentlemen.  It is true.  When you don't know what to say, you're pretty.  I mean, it's wonderful.  Okay.  They had some good chemistry, man, this morning.  Yeah.  Without a doubt.  And finally, the last one.  Is this where he yells at the audience?  Kind of?  All right, let me just play it.  London and England, anyway, was, you know, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones.  We have Radiohead now.  We have great bands like that. 
[01:05:30]  What kind of bands would you like to bring over there?  Which kind of bands?  Well, I actually like Led Zeppelin.  I don't think they're going to get back together.  One of them died, I think.  One of them did die.  One of them actually lives around the corner from me, though.  Not the dead one.  No, the alive one.  That would be really weird if you just saw them walking around.  So you went on a road trip with your girlfriend.  You guys going to leave me up to that again?  How many jokes did you think of today?  It's like 11, right out of the shoe with nothing.  All right, she's got her steaks. 
[01:06:00]  What does she care for?  Sorry, Rachel.  That was classic.  Because he was just boom, boom, boom with the jokes.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden he realized nothing from the crowd.  Yeah.  So you're going to leave me out to hang out the dry here in front of 40 million people?  How many jokes did you come up with this morning?  Very good, Jay.  How many jokes?  That's what he asked the audience.  I know.  How many jokes did you think of?  All right.  Oh, dear.  And once again, Jay was just awesome and gave us a fine plug. 
[01:06:30]  Yep.  And then Kelly Ripa, you know Jay wrote it down and said, look, please, help me out.  Kelly Ripa, do this for us today.  I want to thank Jay Moore, who will be at Caroline's tonight.  And you can listen to him on the Opie and Anthony Show 1027 in the New York metro area.  Thank you.  The Opie, Opie, Opie.  And like that guy brought up a little earlier, it's kind of weird that Kelly Ripa is promoting our show after that horrendous Regis abortion bit.  It was all done in character, like Mr. Imus. 
[01:07:00]  Not, you know, it wasn't actually, I didn't want Kelly Ripa to have a haggard abortion.  But these kids, you obviously saw what happened with Kathie Lee every two minutes with the kids.  You see her now, Kathie Lee, she's like, oh, I don't miss that show at all.  Of course she did.  Because they snubbed her.  They wouldn't let her come on and promote her lousy album.  So she's just like, oh, every day I wake up and thank God that I don't have to go and do that show anymore. 
[01:07:30]  Same here, toots.  Same here.  You know what?  It's got to kill her, too, because Kelly Ripa, they're making her look more and more like a young Kathie Lee, man.  I know.  The hair color's changing.  Kelly's got some of the same mannerisms that Kathie Lee used to have.  If in a couple of years, after she has this kid, she comes on and starts singing, my egg, my daddy, and me, I swear to God. 
[01:08:00]  I swear.  All right, bye request.  We got the abortion bit?  This will wrap up the whole Jay Moron, Bruce and Kelly bit.  Kelly Ripa, if you're listening, anyone that knows Kelly Ripa, just don't, turn the dial right now.  Yeah, please.  Just turn it.  Because we, you know we love you.  I love the Kelly.  Regis.  Yes?  Regis has a new co-host.  A new co-host for Live with Regis and who? 
[01:08:30]  It's now going to be called Live with Regis and Kelly.  Regis and Kelly.  Kelly's from...  Well, who's this hot whore?  Kelly's from All My Children.  I love it.  Some hot number on my show, finally.  I dumped that, uh, Kathy Lee.  And now this one, ooh, I want to get my F on with her.  Let me tell you.  Uh...  I'll slam that A.  Uh, C.  Uh, Regis.  Everything.  Gelman, get me a rubber.  Uh, I don't know where she's been.  Uh, uh, Regis.  Who wants to F Regis? 
[01:09:00]  Uh, uh, Regis.  I'll punch her in the T's.  Regis, before you think that...  Yes?  Please.  Uh-huh.  She's from, uh, All My Children.  All My Children.  You know, those, uh, soap girls.  Very hot.  I like that.  I'll get my F on.  Uh...  I've cheated on my wife one time, according to the star, allegedly.  I gotta say that, you know.  He has sold the wine.  All right, Mike Tyson.  Regis.  Yes?  She's four months pregnant.  Four months...  What?  Your new co-host is four months pregnant. 
[01:09:30]  It's gonna be Regis and...  Four months...  If this bitch calls it Cody or Cassidy, I'm killing her.  Killing her!  I gotta get Mike Tyson on the phone.  Perhaps she could punch her in the gut a few times.  Gelman, come here.  Gelman!  First show, live with, uh, Regis and Kelly, it's an abortion show.  Hangar abortion show.  Four months?  That's not bad.  Gelman, get over here.  Regis.  Help me out with this thing.  Get me some gloves and a hanger.  Regis, you're outrageous.  I'm gonna pull my fetus off, Gelman.  You're outrageous.  Do you... 
[01:10:00]  Do you honestly believe I want another woman here that's having a baby?  I was tired of the stories all day with the Cassidy and the Cody.  Now I'm gonna have a Kelly talking about children?  Get the hanger, Gelman.  Get me a floebie.  We'll suck it out.  I don't care.  You know, we sit on those high stools on the set.  Perhaps she could just fall and a spontaneous miscarriage.  Help me, Gelman. 
[01:10:30]  Grease the stool.  Do something.  What do you do, Gelman?  It's not that bad.  She's young.  She can bounce back.  I thought you wanted to do her, though.  Fine.  But she doesn't have to get pregnant.  What's the matter?  You don't do it in the dumper?  Do it in the dumper, Kelly.  Just suck it, you bitch.  Unbelievable.  Now she'll be babbling about children.  I finally got rid of that twat, Kathy Lee.  Now I have to deal with this. 
[01:11:00]  Eatin' ain't cheatin'.  That's what Regis and the president say.  Eatin' ain't cheatin'.  Well, congratulations, Regis.  Well, I didn't know about this pregnancy.  It's Regis and Kelly.  For God's sake.  Starting next Monday.  Regis and Kelly Lee?  No, no, no, no.  Kelly Ripa or something like that.  Perhaps I could spike her food with some kind of a spontaneous abortion pill.  Think of the rating, Scout.  Think of the rating.  Where she's propped up in the stirrups.  Me, with gloves and a hanger on. 
[01:11:30]  Maybe we could have a guest help me.  We'll have Wayne Newton come on and assist.  He's always good on the show.  And the fetus will look just like GIF.  Dig in here.  Let me dig in.  Hold on, Gellman.  Okay, I got an arm.  I'm gonna puke.  Cut it out.  Look at the ratings go up.  Cut it out.  This bitch better take it to the dumper.  Let's, uh... 
[01:12:00]  Perhaps if she drives home in the snow, she'll hit an abutment.  No, who uses that word?  No, Regis, you picked her.  You wanted her.  Look, the fetus looks more like Gellman.  You had all those women.  You wanted Kelly.  I didn't know about the pregnancy.  I thought she had a bunch.  I find out it's a baby.  I thought she had a fat upper, you know, Regis.  Not a baby.  I spent years with that Kathy Lee bitch talking about her children.  What, and now I have to look forward to Kelly doing Christmas albums with another little kid? 
[01:12:30]  Hell no.  Hell no.  Get the phobia.  This isn't right.  For the love of God.  Here it comes.  Give me that baby.  Give me the baby.  Give it to me.  I'm going to...  There it goes.  In the toilet.  I swear, Gellman, if she brings that little bastard in, I'm going to kill myself. 
[01:13:00]  I'll kill myself.  There will be rated.  Or I'll kill it myself.  Right clear the next time, Rick.  Tommy.  Yeah?  Yeah, what's up?  What does the matter with you guys?  What?  What's your problem?  What do you mean, what's my problem?  Regis.  Come on, stop talking about ripping the kids' arm off.  What's the matter with you guys?  Okay, I'll try to get it all in one piece.  Seems to be the problem.  I can understand his outrage.  I'll go in and get the whole thing.  Uh, Sam, what's up? 
[01:13:30]  Regis, why are you hitting on Kelly so bad?  Girls are hot.  I don't like the idea of a child, but I'll tell you one thing I'm going to do, Gellman.  I'll leave some prints in that kid's soft head.  Oh, my God.  I'll do it.  You know about doing pregnant women, right?  Of course, Gellman.  Check.  I'm a madman now.  Madman.  Check, please.  I had it going.  I was having fun with Kelly, and something bit my junk.  Didn't even think they had teeth. 
[01:14:00]  I'll bend her over that tall stool, Gellman.  I'll bend her right over the tall stool.  And speaking of stools.  What?  God damn it, I thought we were all having fun.  Why is everyone so upset on the phone?  I won't have her bringing children in.  Doug, what's going on?  Enough, guys.  Come on.  What's the problem, Doug? 
[01:14:30]  Doug, talk to me.  What's the problem?  Use your brains.  Use your brains.  Come on.  I'm turning you guys off, but I'll listen to you guys tomorrow.  Doug, what's the problem?  Enough.  Enough with what?  Think about what you're doing.  I'm talking about Kelly, my new co-host.  She's pregnant, Doug.  What am I supposed to do?  She's pretty hot, though.  What am I supposed to do?  Now she's going to bring children on like that Kathy Lee whore.  Enough.  Pull the plug.  Punch out, man.  Pull the plug on the baby.  Oh, Jesus.  I said, Gellman, you bite this umbilical cord. 
[01:15:00]  You bite it.  What's your problem with kids?  Rick, what the...  It's always time to stop when Rick writes that one.  Hey, Mike, what's going on?  Why doesn't O.J. just take care of the whole thing?  That's what I'm worried about here.  I mean, the whole Regis thing.  O.J., O.J., hello?  Regis Philbin, O.J., from live with Regis and some other whore.  Kelly.  Regis and Kelly.  Kelly, whatever.  Big day for you, Regis.  O.J., I need your help.  Come on the show, and I swear to God, could you just slit someone's throat again? 
[01:15:30]  You've done it once before.  What's the problem?  She's blonde and white.  Kill her.  Kill the bitch.  If she only liked it up the old dirt road, she wouldn't be pregnant.  I wouldn't have to worry about these things.  I love it.  You know something?  If only she was a crumpet muncher.  If she was a crumpet muncher, there wouldn't be this problem.  Well, doggie.  The baby from her stomach is checking in.  Uh, yes, little one. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah, why don't you come try it, you little bitch?  Come on, I swear to God, I'm going to stick my hand in the elbow deep and pull you out.  Yeah, really?  I can't take these kids anymore.  You already tried it with a wire, you son of a bitch.  I'll get you next time.  You're bobbing and weaving, but I'll get you.  You know...  I'll hook you like a trout.  Smart-ass fetuses, I guess.  I'm trying to do a program.  I'm trying!  Regis, it's your problem, though.  You picked her.  I didn't know.  I swear to God. 
[01:16:30]  You had a lot of other pieces of asses.  I thought she was hitting the danish a little too hard and had the fat upper P region.  I've seen it before.  And then before you know it, they're parading them on the show singing Christmas songs.  Jay, what's up?  Ed, you are a sick cat.  This brings you to a new low, man.  Why don't you have Mike Tyson come in there and take care of her?  Perhaps I should call Mike Tyson.  A couple of body blows the baby's got.  Maybe we can get her familiar with the surroundings of the set.  Bring her up on the catwalk for the lighting and push her off! 
[01:17:00]  Gentlemen, book it.  Ron, what's up?  Hey, Reg, can we poll the audience and see if we can ask them if we can pickle a placenta?  Maybe put it in a jar?  Now, you're that confident that the audience can help you?  What about cocky, you guys?  You're that confident.  You're going to phone a friend.  How about you phone the fetus and tell him, get the hell out of it!  Let's go to Carol.  Carol, what's up?  Hi, guys.  How are you?  Hello.  Hey.  Regis, I have bad news for you. 
[01:17:30]  What now?  Miss Ripa already has a child.  You're kidding.  No, I watch all my children and this is her second child, yeah.  It doesn't sing, does it?  Um, I don't believe so.  Perhaps I could beat the child with the fetus.  Take two birds with one stone, Gelman.  What a c**ch!  Oh, whoa, Regis!  What's the problem?  Hello?  You didn't say that!  I say it on my show all the time, Miss D. Laird.  You can't say that.  I'll see you next Tuesday.  You can't say that, John? 
[01:18:00]  But what if she is, John?  Yeah.  What's up?  I want to know if Regis can bang Kelly so hard that he gets a hummer from the fetus.  Oh, my God.  All right, look at the time.  Oh, God, no.  Oh.  And I'm sick.  Ah!  All right, I'm going to...  Let's change the subject.  Thank you, Regis.  Good luck with the new show, Regis and Kelly.  Thank you, thank you.  A week from Monday.  It's going to be Regis and a pile of placenta.  Live with Regis and a pile of placenta.

[01:23:00]  212-757-1027.  George has a good observation.  George.  Yeah, how is it that you guys just have played a commercial for adoption,  Barbara Walters special,  but meanwhile you're talking, have a whole skit on abortion with Kelly Ripper?  I don't know.  Oh, man.  You guys rock.  Peace.  Sometimes it works that way.  I don't know what to tell you.  Hey, Gorilla Boy's on the line.  Jeff Norris, what's going on, man?  Jeff.  Jeff.  Jeff. 
[01:23:30]  Hello?  He gave up on us and hung up?  Did you hang up?  Jeff?  Gorilla Boy?  All right.  You got arrested or something.  Is Paul Mercurio here?  Yeah.  Bring him in.  Shoo, what's going on?  Yo, I just wanted to see if I could get a plug for my shop  since I sent you guys those Redneck ACDC songs.  Oh, you rocked for sending those in.  Yeah, I thought you guys would get a kick out of them.  Even we can make fun of ourselves down there, huh?  I'm from down in Oklahoma.  I wanted to get a plug for my bike shop.  Hot Shoe Motor Works in Rahway. 
[01:24:00]  You just did it, man.  Right on.  732-574-0255.  Now, you know that band or what?  Yeah, they're local guys down there.  They're morning jocks down in Tulsa.  I don't have a mobile file.  Well, they do a good job at the ACDC stuff.  Yeah, they got a couple other goofy ones on there,  and then they got this cowboy that tells jokes,  you know, like she shops on the chunky side of the peanut butter aisle  and things like that.  Well, we're going to talk to the lead singer of Haysey Dixie sometime today.  Right on.  Thank you, bro.  I've got to let you go because Jeff Norris is calling back. 
[01:24:30]  Way cool.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Thanks for sending the CD in.  Gorilla Boy.  Gorilla Boy.  Hi, guys.  Hi.  Oh, great white gorilla.  Don't destroy our village.  Hey, Anthony, let me ask you something.  Are martial art tattoos considered a prop?  No.  No?  Not with you.  If not, I'll get skin grafting.  Now I'm a prop comic.  Somebody kicking someone's ass is a prop.  Hey, Jeff.  Maybe you can do that.  That's a good one.  Jeff, just in case you weren't listening earlier, Anthony called you a hack.  I did not. 
[01:25:00]  Really?  I try to bring the character to life.  All right, I'll leave the Archie hat home.  What do you want me to tell you?  Hi.  Hi.  Now, what happened?  All right.  First of all, I just want to tell you guys that I am forever in debt to you guys, because  if it wasn't for you, I would be...  Now, listen.  And the Port Authority cops, if you're listening, thank you.  You guys were very nice.  I was on law and order.  Did I set a law and order yesterday?  Yeah.  I'm driving home.  This little...  You got the dumb button ready?  No, don't curse. 
[01:25:30]  No, okay.  These two white trash punks cut in front of my truck, don't realize there's another  car in front of me jam on a brake, so naturally I do.  All my stuff goes forward, and the fake 9mm lands on my dashboard.  Now, what are you doing with a fake 9mm in your car?  I told you.  I was a cop on the set of law and order.  Yeah, but usually they don't let you take the props home with you.  No, no.  It's my own.  I bought a cop uniform and the whole stuff.  Wait a minute.  All right.  There's a lot going on here.  You get a part on a TV show, but you have to buy your wardrobe and your props. 
[01:26:00]  No, what I did was I went out and I bought it through this acting school and took headshots  in it and submitted it to these different cop shows, because I always said people told  me I could get a cop role.  So anyway, here I'm thinking it's a lucky break, and this kid cuts me off, and everything  goes flying, and the gun and the nightstick and everything lands on my desk.  But wait, wait, wait.  We've got to slow you down again, though. 
[01:26:30]  Why would you have the prop gun?  I mean, why would they allow you to bring your own prop gun to the set of law and order?  Don't they have that just laying around?  Well, they do have stuff, but I had my own, you know, I had my own stuff.  And since you were taking the pictures for this so you could submit them to the shows,  why would you have to then take the stuff with you?  Well, they like you.  In other words, I guess it enhances your chances of getting on or getting lines or what have 
[01:27:00]  you, because I guess it's like a prepared, like you go to school with a pencil.  You have to take your own purpose.  Schools have pencils, but you bring your own.  Yeah.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  So everything goes flying forward.  Right.  So with this, me with my psycho temper, I yell at the kid.  The kid throws a...  Can I back up again?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Go ahead.  Jeff, are you feeling left out?  Haven't been on the show in a while.  Need to come up with a good story for our show?  No, not at all.  Just checking.  Not at all.  All right.  The story just seems a little fishy. 
[01:27:30]  All right.  Go ahead.  Now that I feel like a total a-hole.  No.  I want to hear the rest of it.  Now we need to hear the rest of the story.  Holy Christ.  You know, I have a lot of friends, but I think the one thing I question is you.  Oh, frosted mini-wheat.  Don't destroy our village.  Frosted mini-wheat.  Now, anyway, to make a long story short, they thought it was a real gun.  They freaked out.  They pulled their guns on me.  They found out who I was.  Everything was cool.  And Port Authority cops are good people. 
[01:28:00]  Well, because the cops came, and then they look in the car.  They treated me like Rodney King.  I got coughed.  I just felt like an idiot.  And I told him, I was just, you know, I said, I'm an act.  I swear to Christ.  Gun, partner.  The one cop knew me from the show, and he said he's a big fan,  and they were really good guys, and I wanted to thank them.  They're good people.  And I don't feel left out for the show.  Gun, partner.  Oh, Jeff, I was just kidding.  You know we are.  I know.  I'm only teasing.  I'm only teasing. 
[01:28:30]  And I'm not plugging nothing, so don't worry about it.  Hey, what's Otto up to these days?  Otto's away.  I think he's either in.  You're built too long.  That one by accident.  I meant to push.  I ain't saying you're a lying scumbag.  See?  See, Jeff?  See, Jeff, you have the problem?  If next time someone goes to kick your foot at car lines, I'm going to walk away.  I wanted to see the guy get beat up.  Yeah.  See, Jeff, and you're abusing me.  I didn't push that button.  I meant to push the foghorn leghorn. 
[01:29:00]  And what would he say?  I ain't saying you're a lying scumbag.  I'm playing it, man.  Okay.  Thanks, guys.  What the hell were you thinking?  And you got another button you want to push over there?  When you're telling these little stories?  That's a good idea.  Have a point.  It makes it so much more interesting for the listener.  No, that wasn't me.  That was open.  Oh, okay.  Whatever.  Yeah, we'll play that game.  Please don't hurt me, old big white gorilla. 
[01:29:30]  I love when he does that.  Oh, man.  You know what?  Someone is defending you, though.  So why don't we talk to...  Yeah, I'm sure this is sincere, too.  No, I think it is.  Matthew, I think?  Or Matthew?  What's up?  Yeah, I don't know.  Yeah, I just want to, you know, help him clear it up a little bit.  A lot of...  I do extra work myself.  And what happens is a lot of these extra actors, you know, if you have your own props,  your own wardrobe, it makes it easy for you to get roles.  You can bring your own stuff.  It'll give you actually money.  More money to bring your own wardrobe and stuff like that in. 
[01:30:00]  So I see a lot of these guys on Law & Order, you know, they bring in their own props.  Right.  All right, Matthew.  Thank you.  Thank you.  What?  100.  Jeff, that guy, you know, defended you.  I know.  So you have audio of the cops.  When they rolled up to Norris' vehicle.  It's coming right for us!  Melanie, what's going on?  How is it possible that when you're driving, you stop short, stuff lands on top of your dashboard? 
[01:30:30]  Because I was doing 40 and I had a jam on the brake.  Where was this prop gun?  Yeah, but how does it jump off and land on your dashboard?  That's a good question.  Yeah.  I had a garment bag over my passenger seat and everything flew forward.  Fuck, sweetheart.  I'm going back to my favorite...  Yeah, but I drive an SUV, too, and I don't see how stuff to fall on top of my...  Wait, I'm going back to my physics class.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They had me jump up and forward at the same time.  Sure.  Yeah.  Maybe you hit a bump.  It's like the Kennedy assassination.  It would, yeah.  It's the magic gun nightstick theory. 
[01:31:00]  Went forward and to the right.  It's like impossible.  No, it's not impossible.  Well, I mean, the chances of that happening...  Melanie?  All right.  Go through this.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Let me talk to Melanie.  Melanie?  Yes?  Have you ever seen Gorilla Boy?  No.  Just say, okay, I believe you, Gorilla Boy.  No, but I don't.  You see, my...  If I have stuff in my passenger seat and I stop short, everything comes on the floor, nothing  has ever flown up and landed on the dashboard.  Yeah, but, sweetheart, your dirt doll in the front seat wouldn't land on the dashboard. 
[01:31:30]  They're lying, because it's impossible.  Get out of the show.  Don't you get it?  You're the inspiration for Twin Beds, you dirty whore.  Thank you.  All right, Melanie.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Perfect guy to play a cop.  Right.  Paul Materio in the studio, Jeff.  Yeah.  Say hi to Paul.  Hey, Jeff.  Hi, Paul.  How you doing, man?  Hold on.  Let me get rid of Melanie here.  He doesn't...  This is turning out to be a really good segment.  I like this.  I'm going to figure it out myself. 
[01:32:00]  Another actor on the phone, Jeff.  Another Jeff.  Jeff.  Yeah.  What's up, man?  Not much.  I'm on my way to an audition now, and I got three dead horns in the trunk.  But it's okay.  I'm playing a psycho.  Yeah, it's okay, though, because you're trying out for a part.  Yeah, we got him in the trunk, but it's good.  Dude, I mean, the cops stopped me before.  No big deal.  All right.  Thanks a lot, man.  Hey, Gorilla Boy?  Yes, sir.  For the record, I believe you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  Come on, man. 
[01:32:30]  I know.  When are you going to be on Law & Order?  I think...  I don't know.  They shoot it.  I shot it yesterday.  I'm on it today.  I guess it airs...  I guess it takes, like, three weeks.  Yeah.  It's Special Victims Unit.  I don't know when.  It ain't no major big thing.  It's just...  Yeah, that's cool, though.  You're a mini-week, goddammit.  Yeah, that's right.  I'm the first at mini-week.  He's more than that, too.  He gets tackled in that Stack of Two commercial.  I saw that one, too.  I was running during the XFL stuff.  Well, if I can, I did get a part in a movie, so that's one thing I will say.  What movie?  I'm in a movie, uh, start shooting next week called... 
[01:33:00]  Fantasia?  Huh?  Nothing.  It's called I'm With Lucy.  It stars Monica Potter.  Who's that?  What are you?  Wait, wait, wait.  Yeah, wait.  He's in that movie with Morgan Freeman, Along Came a Spider.  Oh, yeah.  Why are you getting mad and saying, why do I tell you this?  You know what?  Let me tell you something.  Now you're friggin' talk.  First of all, okay, you got...  Hey, every comic on there, and they're all great. 
[01:33:30]  I'm not saying that.  Hey, Jeff, don't do a Billy and Paul on us here.  I'm never going to do that.  I'm your friend, but I'm saying, how come you allow every other guy to call and plug  and come in and say anything, and I call, and it's like, uh, die, die, get the coffin.  Gorilla Boy, you just plugged for 20 minutes.  That's good stuff.  I mean, I was telling you a life-threatening story where I trapped myself.  And we're entertaining the people.  The phones are going crazy.  Look, Sarah wants to say hi to you.  Hold on.  Oh, Christ. 
[01:34:00]  You ought to put the good talk all through.  Of course.  Look, Sarah, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Did he also have to get stitches on the side of his head because the motorcycle went into  his car?  Oh, my car.  Okay, look.  Yeah.  Remember our old intern?  No.  Jeff, look, I didn't know if she was going to say that.  That's right.  Vinny from Rosedale saying, hey, Norris, when Santa and the Easter Bunny come over, tell  him I said hi.  That's not me, though.  No, that's cool.  I still believe in that. 
[01:34:30]  That's cool.  All right.  I agree with Gorilla Boy.  I'm an extra in porno movies, and they recommend you bring your own junk.  Nice.  That's pretty good, man.  Hold on.  Pete just found a hole in your story.  One?  Pete, what's up?  Oh, Pete.  Hey, what's up, guys?  How you doing?  Hey, listen.  First of all, this guy's a clown.  He's got an SUV, right?  No.  He's got one of these monster trucks, basically.  All right.  Check this out now.  He says that the bag was sitting on top of the passenger seat, right?  Mm-hmm.  Right.  That's still way below the dashboard, guys. 
[01:35:00]  No, it's not.  I mean, it's got to climb up.  It's kind of a Dodge Ram.  Tom up.  Yeah, tom up, tough guy.  You might be stupid.  You're a jerk, bro.  You're a jerk.  You're a big goofball, man.  Let me tell you something.  Let me tell you something.  I drive an SUV myself.  I'm in one right now, and I'm telling you.  I got a couple guys.  Thank you.  Your mother had me up all night, bro.  I deliver peaches for Domino's. 
[01:35:30]  I have no life, so I have to go on Opie and Anthony.  It's off the night.  No, but you got a life.  You're auditioning with a cop's in your car to get a role on Law and Order, but you got  a life.  That's right, my friend.  Let me tell you.  I'm not going to be so personal, bro.  You don't know me.  You're up in a corner.  All right.  Go back to your home, bro.  All right.  What I'm going to say is that if you've got a duffel bag on the floor.  Hold on.  You can't full talk.  It's Jeff's brother, everybody.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is he done?  Can I speak for a second?  Yeah, go ahead, Pete. 
[01:36:00]  For a second.  Okay.  What I'm saying is that if the duffel bag's on the passenger seat, it's still way below the  dashboard.  If he stops short, unless there's a midget in his duffel bag pushing it up, it's not coming  up that far.  What are you, Come on, bro?  Come on, bro.  Come on.  Come on, bro.  Last Tuesday, I need to follow you.  I can't believe that you're questioning this.  I've seen this happen before.  There was an episode where Martin Landau was driving, and I believe he hit somebody, and  a gun flew up and fired and hit a guest on Moody Amsterdam. 
[01:36:30]  It could happen.  It killed your dog, Lieutenant, didn't it?  It killed my dog and Mrs. Colombo.  All right, Morris, I'm willing to believe your story.  There's just a few holes.  Pardon me.  Can I ask you one more question?  Sure.  What planet did this happen on?  It could possibly be Earth.  I understand gravity and physics. 
[01:37:00]  So what dimension was this, sir?  You were dressed in a cop's uniform.  Correct.  So you're in a police officer's uniform.  No, I wasn't in a uniform.  That's true.  Yes, you were.  No, I wasn't.  I actually have the Dodge website up.  I am looking at the interior of a Dodge Ram to see how high.  You really think I'd learn.  Instead of calling you guys, you really think I would learn. 
[01:37:30]  It actually has an asterisk.  It says, do not put 9mm fake gun when going to be extra at North and Order.  It has a tendency to jump up onto the dashboard.  It goes up and to the right.  It's all there.  It's small print.  Got to read it.  There you go.  There you go.  I'm looking.  Wow.  Jeff, you didn't have a tryout in the new Matrix movie, did you?  The Matrix.  All right.  I'm looking.  Oh, what do you think?  If something is on the seat, do you think it can go up? 
[01:38:00]  Anthony, you know how big a seat is in the truck?  I'm looking at the seat of your...  That's where your head sits.  Yes.  Okay?  That's where it was drooped.  It was drooped over the top of the seat.  Oh, oh, oh.  So it was over the back of the seat.  How do you balance a gun on the back of the seat?  Yeah.  No, the bag.  It was in the bag.  You still had to get out of the bag, though.  Yeah, I had to get out of the bag.  It has hands and unzips.  It was in a garment bag.  It's the David Blaine of guns.  He got himself out of the bag. 
[01:38:30]  That trick's going to be on ABC next week.  Exactly.  Right?  I am going to stand in a block of ice.  And a gun will fly out of my...  And then there will be a tornado of fire.  And I will deny my sexuality yet again.  Who am I?  David Cuffer, please.  I like that they put grease on his eyebrows so they wouldn't singe.  He had like 32-gallon drums of grease on his eyebrows.  I'm sorry for getting you off on your hands.  That's okay. 
[01:39:00]  Gorilla Boy?  Yes, sir?  You know we kid because we love.  Oh, then you guys must be madly in love with me.  Rick must fantasize about me at night, then.  Come on.  If you kid for love, then I've got to be the most loved guy.  Come on.  This is too good.  We couldn't pick on Earl today.  We had to find somebody.  Yeah, you took a beat the other day.  All right, fellas.  I've got to get out of here.  You've got to...  Just welcome me.  Do you have any gigs, Norris?  Am I allowed?  Sure.  After that beating?  Of course.  Next Thursday and Friday night at Caroline's with Jim Brewer. 
[01:39:30]  Hey, nice.  Yeah, and I was looking forward to working with Jay, but there was too many comics, so I got the bump.  But I'll be on the show next Thursday and Friday with Brewer at Caroline's.  Hey, come on in and say hi to us next week, all right?  Will do.  Thanks, fellas.  You're the best.  All right, Jeff.  Bye, man.  Jeff Norris, Gorilla Boy.  It was like that episode with William Shatner as the magician.  Remember that one?  All of a sudden, guns are flying out of garment bags and whatnot, landing on bass boards.  It was just like that episode. 
[01:40:00]  And let me decide.  At the time of the shooting, you were having dinner with the gun.  Is that correct?  So it's on the back of your seat in a garment bag, and suddenly the brakes are applied, and it flies right through the plastic.  The gun stops.  It has a sip of coffee on the way to the dashboard.  I hear the gun was chipping golf balls the whole time.  Now, your neighbor says you like to take walks on the beach with your gun.  Is that correct?  It's a prompt gun. 
[01:40:30]  I hear for years, Bill Shatner walked around with a phaser.  He had to have his own phaser with him during the Star Trek series.  Now, let me listen to this, Captain Kirk.  The phaser flew out of your ass.  Hit Mr. Sulu in the head and continue toward the viewing screen.  You know those big gloves during the games that's a triskelion?  William Shatner supplied those.  They were actually candy dishes from his own house, I do believe.  And a spaghetti conlander monster from Lost in Space. 
[01:41:00]  That belonged to a part of the cast.  That was young William's.  Spaghetti conlander.  What a list I got.  We have to take a break.  Paul Mercurio in the studio.  And Di Nicola.  And Mike Di Nicola.  Hey, everybody.  Mike Di Nicola.  He's in the band seat, though.  I can't see him.  Yeah, I know.  The band seat.  He's behind that big, huge computer screen.  Watch out for flying fire alarms.  And we got the guy that sings the ACDC country songs.  Oh, nice.  On the hotline.  We'll talk to him next. 
[01:41:30]  Opie and Anthony present the best in reality programming starting next Monday.  The Whipped Cream Bikini Contest.  No tribal council.  No drill sergeants.  Just hot bodies and cool whipped cream.  Ladies, all you need to do is show up at WNEW between 3 and 7.  You bring the body.  We bring the whipped cream.  The grand prize, a trip to Hawaii.  The Whipped Cream Bikini Contest.  Only from Opie and Anthony.  Never the weakest link.  1027.  WNEW.  Saturday night starting at 7.  WNEW gives you wheeze.  Hey, what's up, wheezer? 
[01:42:00]  And cheese.  7 to 10 is Brother Wee.  Endorsed by Opie and Anthony.  At 10, Eddie Trump cranks out the best variety of metal.  And cheesy hair bands on Saturday night rocks.  Wheeze.  Wheeze.  Nice.  And cheese.  At 107.  WNEW.  Liam from Woodside.  I believe this guy.  He says, after all, I drive around with a baseball bat in my trunk because I'm trying out for the Yankees.  You just want to be prepared. 
[01:42:30]  Just watch.  Don't step on the brake.  Anthony, Rockaway Bedding.  1-800-TRY-A-BED.

Gives you a free steel bed frame, free delivery, and free complete removal of that old disgusting mattress that you have in your house.  The delivery is very important because if you tie a mattress to the roof of your car and you stop short, the thing could fly into orbit and hurt the space shuttle.  It's been known to happen.  What you're saying is a flying mattress, because you didn't order from Rockaway Bedding,  a mattress flew off of your vehicle when you stopped at the neck brake speed of three miles per. 
[01:43:30]  Not only that, but it was completely made.  It had sheets.  And Norris was in it.  And a bedrock.  And Norris was sleeping.  It fell in a river, and he floated to an evil castle where he met BuzzFund.  And then they smelled ether and went into slow motion.  It was great.  Happened to Norris the other day.  A lot of other mattress companies, they leave that old disgusting bed in front of your house, 
[01:44:00]  and it's very embarrassing, especially with the bloodstains or whatever.  Rockaway Bedding takes it away for you.  Rockaway Bedding.  You'll sleep better, and you save money.  You can go to a Rockaway Bedding store.  They've got one near you.  Or call them up.  1-800-TRY-A-BED.  1-800-TRY-A-BED for Rockaway Bedding.  O-O-O-O-O-P and Anthony.  What's the wide answer?  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  Uh, hello, ma'am.  This is Lieutenant Columbo.  Uh, I got a couple of questions to ask you. 
[01:44:30]  Uh, could you shove your fist up my...  I'd love it if you could just stick your fist up my...  Listen, get your husband over here.  We'll pop my eye out, and he could skull...  Could you do that, please?  Just skull...  I love that.  Mrs. Columbo, she pulls out a big...  Rips my eye out, and just shoves that thing right to my brain.  I love it. 
[01:45:00]  All right, thank you.  Hey, oh, oh, pardon me.  One more thing, ma'am, one more.  Bury your boot up my...  Could you do that?  And could you just grab my...  And twist it like a pretzel?  I'd love if you grab my...  Grab my shriveled old Columbo...  And twist that thing like a pretzel.  Okay, ma'am.  I gotta get back to the precinct now.  Oh, before I leave, one more thing.  Could you do, ma'am?  One more thing.  Put my...  Could you just clamp down on my... 
[01:45:30]  And squeeze them till they come out of the hole in my head that used to have an eye.  Columbo, don't you have to go arrest Martin Landau?  I was in a series once with Martin Landau.  And after the show, after the shoot, as they call it, I jammed my fist so far up his...  I actually pulled out his prostate.  It was...  It was wonderful.  We used to film at Universal Studios.  And we'd all get together in the commentary. 
[01:46:00]  And pound each other.  I love that.  And...  Pound...  Each other's s**t with a dukeet.  I can't say this.  I love that one.  It's the O&H Show.  212-757-1027.  In studio.  Paul Mercurio.  Yes.  Hey, thank you, guys.  A lot of people asking if you're going to be playing in the area.  I'm going to be in Rascal's, in Ocean Township this weekend, and on The Daily Show. 
[01:46:30]  Nice.  See me on The Daily Show.  One's up the crowd for The Daily Show.  Yeah.  Hilarious.  Right over there.  And you write for Louis Black.  Yeah, I write...  I'm one of the staff writers on the show, and one of the things I write is Louis Black's piece.  Crazy Louis Black.  Vote for him for...  Oh, yeah.  Comic of the Year.  Yeah, go to the, what, the Comedy...  Comedy Central website.  I think the number's 1-900-933-4007.  Pick up the phone.  We want Louis to win that.  Also, Mike DiNicola, we'll get to you in a little bit, but our buddy, our pal, Brother 
[01:47:00]  Weez is on the line.  We sent out the bat signal about an hour ago, and Brother Weez is calling us from Florida.  Weez, what's going on?  I'm in hell, at Disney World.  You're at Disney World?  Yep.  You have to do it, right?  Oh, I got the babies, I got screaming, I got everything.  It's beautiful.  What a great vacation for you, huh?  You have no idea.  Hey, say hi to Paul Mercurio in the studio.  Hey, man.  Hi, Paul.  How you doing, man?  How you doing?  Do you know why we're calling you?  Well, I think Ben just told me.  I feel terrible about that piece. 
[01:47:30]  Well, all right, you can explain.  In the latest RAG magazine, The Star, it says, is TV mob tough guy gay?  Junior Soprano gay in real life?  No way, Jose.  That's what Dominic, 70, Tony Soprano's uncle on the show, has been telling folks after a  caller on WCMF radio claimed during a live interview of Dominic being gay.  He kind of avoided the issue, but his handlers went off on us after the show, swearing he  wasn't said, WCMF jock, brother wheeze. 
[01:48:00]  Brother wheeze, call me a faggot, Tony.  What happened was a chick called up that's part of his family and swore the guy was gay,  right?  So here's what happened.  Yeah.  So when the brother was on the phone with us, I felt it was necessary for me to ask him,  right?  Okay.  I mean, they got all pissed off at me, but this chick swore and she left me her number 
[01:48:30]  and everything else.  So he got, I'll be honest with you, the guy was quite effeminate and he's on the, he's  on the web.  Guilty.  No, listen.  Go ahead.  He's in some, he's in some art film on the web right now.  Yeah.  And he was promoting it.  It's all arty, some Cuban thing.  But he swears he ain't gay and he was mad at me.  Hold on, I'm missing my Mickey Mouse action.  Oh, God damn.  Oh, God damn.  Are you in the Mickey Mouse parking lot? 
[01:49:00]  No, I just pulled out of the parking lot.  Now I'm on some expressway with people yelling at me.  Happiest place on earth.  Anyway.  That's what you call over you banging Mickey in the back of a van.  I just pulled out of the parking lot.  Go ahead, Weez.  Anyway, all I'm saying is that, you know, I could have been bamboozled by LeBron to call  me up because I haven't been able to find her.  And I feel bad that it even happened because I try not to do that kind of radio.  Uncle Jew, I cannot believe you didn't tell me that you take it out of the poop seat.  I can't believe it, Tony.  How am I supposed to have respect in the family when Weez is calling me a fruit? 
[01:49:30]  Oh, God damn.  I already have the cancer, the big casino.  No.  Hey, do you guys ever go down to that chick's clothes store in the East Village?  No.  I mean...  Go ahead.  That chick Dre, you know, that plays Christopher's girlfriend, she's got a store.  She's always there.  Oh, that's right.  Oh, I am?  I was reading about that in the Rolling Stone interview.  Yeah, we should go down and see if she's there.  Nice. 
[01:50:00]  All right.  That's hot.  She's a hot item on the package.  Without a doubt.  Go down there and sniff her panties.  Yeah, that was a twisted scene, wasn't it, Gweez?  Oh, Lord have mercy.  That was out there.  Who did that?  What's his name?  Paulie Walnuts.  No, Paulie Walnuts.  I mean, no, Ralphie.  Wacked that stripping broad.  Yeah, but Paulie Walnuts came into Christopher's house to shake him down a little bit and see 
[01:50:30]  if he's holding back.  And he's going through the drawers and he sniffs it.  He picks up his chick's panties and just takes a big sniff.  Christmas season through the mirror.  Reminds me of my father in my sister's room.  Anyway.  What?  Hey, Wiese, we had the rapist on our show.  You had Uber?  The rapist.  What rapist?  Oh, you're kidding me.  It was cool, but it was kind of weird to, you know, hang out with them.  Why don't you call him a faggot too, Wiese?  I'd love to call him a faggot.  I'm your nephew, Uncle June. 
[01:51:00]  You can tell me you swallowed a chow, Uncle June.  Don't touch the thermostat.  If you guys wrong with this, I'm going to see Mickey.  Don't kill yourselves, you faggot.  And the comedian's faggot too.  All right, Wiese.  Love you, brother.  See you.  Cool.  Have fun.  He's just calling everyone a faggot now.  That's it.  No, I had statement.  No, I, because he's in probably a minivan in the middle of Disney with his wife and like four small kids.  How is he going to like, you know, where does it turn for a guy like that that did like, what, three, four tours of Vietnam? 
[01:51:30]  And all of a sudden he's at Disney.  He did two or three tours of Vietnam.  Did he really?  Because he wanted to.  He kept going back.  He kept re-upping on his own.  He's a DJ in Disney World?  No, he works in Rochester.  How bad would that be?  Hey, kid.  Well, he's talking about a DJ in Disney, and I'm thinking, that's going to be the worst gig, right?  Karmic return. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, yeah.  Brother Wiese does Saturday Nights here.  A festive show.  Oh, my God.  Seven to ten, yeah.  And Tony, I hear he's gay.  And once a month he does it live, and we all hang and have fun with him, okay?  We've got to play this tune, because the lead singer's on the phone, Anthony.  How about that?  Barley Scotch.  Yeah.  He's the singer of this little ditty.  Check it out. 
[01:52:30]  Living easy.  Living free.  Space ticket on a way to ride.  Asking nothing.  Leave me be.  Sending everything in my stride.  Don't need reason.  Don't need rhyme.  There ain't nothing that I'd rather do.  I'm going down.  Party time.  Hear my friends, you're going to be there, dear.  I'm on the highway to hell. 
[01:53:00]  Highway to hell.  Highway to hell.  Highway to hell.  No stop sign.  No stop sign.  Speed limit.  Nobody's going to slow me down.  Like a wheel.  I'm going to spin it.  Nobody's going to mess me around.  Can't say done.  Hit my feet.  I'm playing in the snowgrass band.  Hit my mud. 
[01:53:30]  Look at me.  I'm on my way to the promised land.  I'm on the highway to hell.  Highway to hell.  Highway to hell.  Highway to hell.  Don't stop me.  Don't stop me. 
[01:54:00]  Highway to hell.  Tell me there's a box set of this, please.  What, Paul?  Tell me there's a box set of this.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  A whole CD.  That's Casey Dixie. 
[01:54:30]  And I'm going down.  Yeah, A.C. Dixie.  A.C. Dixie.  A.C. Dixie, yeah.  A.C. Dixie.  You got to say that slow.  A hillbilly tribute to A.C. D.C., Anthony.  And Barley Scotch is on the phone.  Yeah, he's the lead singer of the band, I believe. 
[01:55:00]  Hey, Barley.  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  Hey.  Hey, we've been having some fun playing these tunes the last couple days.  Right on.  We had some fun playing ourselves here a while back.  Well, where the hell are you from?  Man, up on Tennessee, North Carolina, a little place called Deer Lick Holler.  Oh, my God.  It's like deer in the animal, not like deer like your woman.  Really?  Man.  Deer Lick Holler. 
[01:55:30]  Hey, you do some radio down there, too?  Oh, it's way on off in Knoxville.  We can't hardly pick it up much.  Well, you stand out a window and just yell to the neighborhood?  Pretty much, yeah.  Well, that's called a holler.  Got a holler.  Well, the album's getting a lot of attention there, Barley.  It appears to be, man.  I've been on the phone with people all day long.  Really?  Now, who's your band?  Well, if you look at the record there, or CD, I reckon they call it now.  I reckon.  I'm the fellow there holding the fiddle. 
[01:56:00]  Who's that big old boy?  Well, that big old boy is Cletus Williamson.  He's my cousin.  He's playing bass.  Cletus?  Cletus.  Cletus Williams.  Cletus looks like a...  Change his name from Jethro to Cletus.  He wanted to go more showbiz.  Oh, Cletus's proud of his beard there, too.  Cletus looks like the guy that would do that rape scene from...  What the hell movie was that?  I was...  The Burrow.  Hello.  Deliverance.  Deliverance.  Oh, now that's a mighty fine piece of film right there. 
[01:56:30]  Mighty fine.  Now, so you abandoned all the music and everything, because you're talented.  Well, thank you.  Hell, we've been picking together since we were kids.  We grew it up together.  We grew it up together.  Why ain't there none of them colored folk in your band?  Well, there just didn't happen to be no colored folk that we grew it up with.  No?  We got none of these colored folk.  Because of that electric fence you grew it up. 
[01:57:00]  God damn.  I love it.  We got nothing on the radio.  That's great.  That's true.  Get away with that.  Oh, hell.  We do everything.  A little bit of everything.  Right on.  I know you're getting fried on the fence.  They saw the noose and moved on.  Those people there at the doggone media school that have been talking to me all day yesterday,  they done told me wrong.  They said, don't curse at all.  Yeah, don't curse at all.  We ain't cussed. 
[01:57:30]  Well, all right.  Wow.  Hey, man, I'm here for you.  So what other bands are you guys into besides Easy Decent?  Oh, you know, Bill Monroe, Stanley Brothers, French Mountain Boys.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Pretty much just growed up playing a lot of traditional bluegrass.  We hadn't heard no ACDC until right before we got together to make this record.  You memorized my record collection.  Wow.  Really?  So now you didn't even hear ACDC.  No, man.  We've since come to find out they're a pretty famous band.  Why did you pick them over another band that maybe you hadn't heard? 
[01:58:00]  Well, it was a complete flute, man.  I mean, Deerlick Caller is way off the beaten path, and it ain't really on the way to anything.  So we don't get a lot of outside people through there, really.  You know, it's not the kind of place that you just pass through because it ain't on the way to nothing.  But anyways, man, I mean, the way we got to have a high suicide rate.  Well, one day we was all sitting around picking a little and drinking a little, you know, of our corn liquor that we make up there.  We're pretty proud of it.  Corn liquor.  The stranger come hauling ass through town real fast. 
[01:58:30]  Wrapped his car around this old tree down the devil's elbow.  If you don't know what the devil's elbow is, it's a mighty big curve.  I would expect so.  Well, unfortunately, the poor old boy didn't make it.  I mean, he was all tore up.  They shot a Deuce of Hazzard scene there, didn't they?  Yeah, but we were sifting through the wreckage trying to find some way to identify him  so we could let his people know what had happened.  And in the backseat, we pulled out these ACDC albums.  We took them back, put them on a big throw, and gave them a spin.  That's where I fell right in love with them. 
[01:59:00]  Well, that's an uplifting story.  You found a dead guy.  And he all his stuff.  Well, we never did find his people, so if anybody listening happens to this year,  had lost somebody up to do it.  We got him on ice in the cooler back there.  We left the guy to the pigs.  No, we put him in the old refrigerator on the porch, plugged back in.  He's in there chilled.  We have to return the body now.  Maybe he drove in from Mount Pilot.  Well, I reckon that's possible.  That's about an hour over in North Carolina. 
[01:59:30]  There you go, Mount Pilot.  It's there, man.  What do you guys do down there when you're not picking away?  Well, you know, we experiment with hydroponic gardening  and do a lot of alternative fuel and beverage resource kind of manufacturing.  Really?  Yes, sir.  You grow any marijuana?  Well, no, I can't talk too much about exactly what it is.  I mean, we're out on the radio here, right?  Right.  I don't think I ought to say too much.  Do you guys tour around the country?  Oh, no, sir.  Right.  We never have done that. 
[02:00:00]  We just play around the church, so-called and such, around Deerleck.  Sure.  So-called and Deerleck.  Oh, my God.  Well, you know, like that song you just played there,  All the way to hell.  Now, that's a parable, man.  That's a fable.  Yeah, all right.  That's the same theme as a lot of the old bluegrass we grew up picking,  just, I mean, kind of from a different point of view now, but-  Did you play that for Easter?  Well, you know, yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  How many people are in Deerleck?  Oh, about 150, 160.  That's it?  It varies a little bit sometimes.  We should ask him about the Jeff Norris gun thing. 
[02:00:30]  Oh, what happened to him?  You ever have a gun in the passenger seat when you're driving?  Well, usually I put it under my seat.  Yeah.  Well, you're smart.  All right, whatever.  All right.  I'd say enough to have one in the passenger seat.  What might happen?  Well, a guy claimed that he had a prop gun in his passenger seat.  He stopped short, and the prop gun ended up on the dashboard.  Now, is that possible?  Not unless the car flips over, I don't reckon. 
[02:01:00]  The acceleration due to gravity should take that gun more toward the floorboard.  I believe 9.8 meters per second per second.  Oh, by the way, he's an associate professor of physics at Harvard.  That's pretty good.  Farley's pretty funny.  What's your stand on-  Well, of course, not taking into account wind resistance.  Right.  Now, what's your stand on the Confederate flag?  Well, I don't really think much about it one way or the other, really.  Well, now, Mississippi, they decided to keep it. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah.  Well, you know, I heard about that, and when they said they were going to have to take it off,  it just didn't make any sense to me.  I thought, what are they going to do?  Stand a boy around with a carpet knife to cut it out of every flag?  And then wouldn't that flag look pretty stupid with a big hole cut out of the corner of it?  You make a lot of sense.  I just try to be practical.  My daddy raised me like that.  Oh, yeah.  And what do the women look like down there?  Oh, well, you know, some of them are pretty fine.  Some of them, they get a little heavy.  The ones that keep their teeth good, we like that. 
[02:02:00]  Nice.  Well, I would think with a limited amount of people in deer holler, deer lick holler,  deer lump, that you wouldn't have many girls to choose from.  Well, you don't, you know, but it's kind of like riding a sonnet.  I mean, you've got 14 lines, you've got to rhyme it a certain way.  I mean, you know, staying with a pattern can create beauty sometimes.  Oh, my God.  Are you saying there's a little bit of incest going on?  Oh, now, you know, in the eyes of the Lord, I reckon we're all related to some degree or another.  Oh, wow. 
[02:02:30]  That's great.  Really busting a bug, those stereotypes.  What about having sex with the pigs and the sheep and stuff?  Yeah, any beast beyond?  Well, I personally don't have any experience with that now.  Is that because you've been turned down by the sheep and the pigs?  Well, what have you heard, then, if you haven't had the experience?  Well, I haven't heard much.  I've just, you know, seen movies made in places like New York City that mention it,  but I don't know anybody that actually does it.  Are you married?  I'm on the radio, all right?  Yeah.  Oh, sure, I ain't married. 
[02:03:00]  Okay.  Yeah, you've got the girls all worked up in their cars here in New York.  Hey.  You've got an email address, they'll send you off a little email.  Yeah, all right.  I'm thinking Stinky Road Trip.  That deer lick holler.  Do we dare send Stinky to deer lick?  Lord, I don't think he'd come back.  And our own black girl.  We have a black guy that works with us here, a black girl.  And would he be welcome in that deer lick holler?  Well, I'm sure.  Yeah?  He's constantly having sex with a white woman now. 
[02:03:30]  Constantly.  Oh, now, you're trying to drag me into political race issues.  Race issues.  I have no comment on no racial issues.  Very good.  That's the right answer.  He's a diplomat.  He's very diplomatic.  Well, you know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Barley, you're a lot of fun.  Hey, thanks, man.  That's what I'm here for.  I want to be loved.  Have you been up to New York at all?  No, sir, I never have. 
[02:04:00]  You ever been out of deer lick holler?  Yeah.  Yeah, I've been down the road to Knoxville many times, over to Asheville, down to Boone.  Boone.  Down to Boone.  You guys got some of that technology down there?  What kind of technology?  Like the computers and stuff?  Well, you know, our manager, Max Percentage, the reason why he'd become our manager is he  was the only fellow that had a GED and a computer.  So he's pretty computer literate now.  GED and a computer.  It was between him and Joe, who had a toaster and Max Percentage and a flashlight. 
[02:04:30]  You catch the name of his manager, Max Percentage?  Yeah.  We had one.  His name was Owen Money.  There you go.  Hey, you guys into the George W. down there?  The George W.  You like George W., the president?  Well, you know, I think I would have had a lot more fun hanging out with the fellow y'all  had up there before.  Okay.  He seemed like he knew where the ladies was at.  And this one you got in there right now don't seem like he's even interested in women.  Hey, you're making it sound like you're from another country and you don't like our president.  He's yours, too.  Right. 
[02:05:00]  Oh, I don't have nothing to get him.  I don't even know the man.  He just doesn't seem like he'd be nowhere near as much fun as that old Clinton thing.  No, Bill Clinton was fun.  I mean, I never read stuff about him.  I thought, now I want to party with this guy.  Old George, he just seems to strike life.  I don't know if I'd have any fun with him.  Yeah.  You into the militias or anything like that?  No, I don't know nothing about no militia.  He's like, you know, a deer with muzzles, but, you know, no.  You into the militia?  No, no. 
[02:05:30]  It's hard to get one started here in Manhattan.  Yeah.  We've got plenty of people with problems.  Really solid rock this island.  They frown upon that in Manhattan.  Huh.  Well, you just have to go underground, man.  They're keeping us down.  Mm-hmm.  Hey, could you say well-doggy?  Say what?  Well-doggy.  Well-doggy?  Yeah, like people say that down there?  No, I don't think I've ever heard anybody say that.  When you get excited about something, it's got to be clean.  What's an expression that's local to your town that, like, we would never hear?  Give us one.  Like, when you're not, you know, like you say, oh, my God. 
[02:06:00]  Like, we say, oh, my God.  What would you say?  For land sakes.  For land sakes.  For land sakes.  Sakes alive.  Yep.  Hey, Barley.  Yeah.  Jeff Foxworthy.  Funny?  No.  Yeah.  All right.  We can hang with you.  That old boy way too clean cut.  He ain't a genuine article.  You like Gallagher?  I don't believe I've ever seen me no Gallagher.  He's the guy that busts apart the big watermelon with the hammer at the end of his act.  The fruit has no chance.  Never seen the old boy.  Just sitting there.  He can't roll off the floor. 
[02:06:30]  He's like kind of a waste, though, man.  You can make good wine out of watermelons.  You can see that watermelon's trying to roll off.  Thank God we got one of them delays.  Yeah, we had to dump out there.  All right, Barley.  Sure.  All right, Barley.  We'll be letting you go.  You say hi to everyone down there.  We'll be playing your record.  Man, we sure do appreciate you playing that record.  You want to give out any plugs or anything?  I just said the label here tells me it's in every Walmart in the country today. 
[02:07:00]  You got Walmarts in New York?  No, I don't know.  Not around in these parts.  Well, I don't know.  They tell me it's in every record store in the country.  I have not gone and personally inspected all of them yet, but I aim to try here once they get me hooked up with a car.  How did you get discovered that you've got like a national thing out there?  How did you get discovered like that?  Well, I mean, our manager, he, I guess, got on that Internet and hooked up with some people down there in Nashville.  And next thing I know, we've done a Nashville cutting this album that you got up there right now. 
[02:07:30]  That's great, man.  Congratulations.  Hey, well, thank you.  All right, we're going to plug your album and you go plug your sister.  Hey, we appreciate it.  All right, Barley.  All right, see you.  Bye-bye.  I believe we have found a new friend of the show right there.  There we go.  Barley Scotch.  We've got to play a little piece of another one now.  Max Percentage.  This is Hay Seed Dixie, a hillbilly tribute to ACDC.  I guess it's in a lot of record stores right now. 
[02:08:00]  Oh, hold on.  Oh, hold on.  Psycho Mark's checking in from Jamaica.  Hello?  He's calling us.  He's calling us collect.  What's up?  Psycho Mark is in Jamaica.  Dude, I'm in the grill right now.  It's like 95 degrees.  Beautiful sun out.  We're destroyed.  Oh, yeah.  Dude, it's like Candyland.  Effing Candyland.  Whatever you want.  20 bucks, man.  No worries, man.  Where's Jamaican Mike when you need him? 
[02:08:30]  So are you smoking a lot of pot?  Oh, dude.  The best part, right?  We all met at the airport when we landed in Montego Bay.  Everybody was on the same tour.  It was about 80 potheads, right?  Yeah.  We didn't have to buy one single joint.  Everyone brought about 15 pounds of weed with us on the plane.  You can hear how high it is.  I know.  I'm destroyed.  So we all smoked.  Well, we bought tons of weed, everything.  You name it.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  You said the F word, Psycho Mike.  Oh, I bet you're fine.  I'm sorry. 
[02:09:00]  Did you talk to your doctor about stanker tea?  I didn't talk to your doctor about marijuana and the effects of it.  Hey, Ben, set me up.  I'm going right to a meeting as soon as I fly back to jail.  Oh, you have a listen to him.  What are you drinking?  Everything.  Oh, 151, man.  Oh, God.  No, I just counted red stripes, dude.  What about that shroom tea?  They do that down there?  Oh, yeah.  They can eat the tea.  I haven't even touched it yet because, I mean, forget about it.  It'll be over, Johnny. 
[02:09:30]  You're over, Johnny.  Go figure, man.  Go figure.  I am with some of the most professional weed smokers in the entire world.  Chef Ra is down here and Potstar is down here as well.  Potstar?  From High Times Magazine.  Oh, you're smoking.  Remember Chef Ra?  You're smoking with professional pot smokers.  How are you stacking up?  With Stacker, I'm doing very well.  No, you're keeping up with him and stuff? 
[02:10:00]  Oh, dude, it's like one blunt after the next.  Forget about it.  It's ridiculous.  I got on the bus.  This guy pulls out a giant stick of marijuana.  Ten bucks.  In New York, 150 at least.  Well, why don't you take some back with you, Mark?  I just want to make a disclaimer right now to all the guys working at JFK.  I ain't bringing S back with me.  Not a S-ing iota.  But the person in front of me is going to have a surprise in there.  Hey, but Ted Kennedy's on a plane. 
[02:10:30]  Why don't you search him?  All right, you effed up fool.  I love it.  Do we charge enough money on the phone or what?  Yeah, call us tomorrow because tomorrow is 420.  Dude, I'll call you guys right at 420.  Wait.  Dude, it's canceling your appointments all day.  How did you afford this call?  I just made a collect call.  So hopefully Jeremy will just pick the charges up.  Wait a minute.  You called collect from Jermaine Cup.  Why not?  Go Sarks.  How about those Yags?  They only won one frigging game. 
[02:11:00]  The scumbags.  That's all right.  This weekend, huh?  Go Sarks.  Like I said, Boston, they have to win at the beginning of the season,  so it could be that much more painful at the end.  Oh, absolutely.  Hey, second, Mark?  I can't wait to get back because I've got some insane stories.  This is the first annual trip of Spring Bake 2001,  so hopefully it'll do it next year as well.  Well, get your thoughts together.  Call us tomorrow and tell us a few stories.  My thoughts together?  Forget about it.  I know, I know.  I think I'm, hey, this is about as good as I'm going to get.  Tomorrow I'll be 10 times worse. 
[02:11:30]  Get his thoughts together, yeah.  Forget about it.  Please.  Hopefully I'll have two chicks in my face and one of my jocks.  See you later.  Bye.  Take it easy, Mark.  It's like a Mark.  There he goes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm so amped up.  From Jamaica.  Two chicks in my face.  I don't know.  All right, what am I doing?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  One-fifth and one.  Smoking for this guy from high time.  I'm effing this and FFF.  Rob.  Yo.  Hey, what's up? 
[02:12:00]  What's happening, boys?  The last 20 minutes have been some of the best radio that I have ever heard.  That guy, he was hysterical.  Oh, yeah, we've got to get back to Barley Scotch.  It was good.  All right, bro.  Uh, are you thinking what I'm thinking?  Huh?  Road trip to Derry.  I mean, deer lick.  Yeah, we're thinking about it.  Well, deer lick.  We'll see if we can...  Deer lick.  All right.  As we go to break, Paul Mercurio in the studio.  Another one from Hacy Dixie.  A hillbilly tribute to Hacy Dixie.  It's in record stores.  She was a fast machine. 
[02:12:30]  She kept the motor clean.  She was the best damn woman that I've ever seen.  She had the sightless eyes, telling me no lies.  Locked me out with them American guys.  Seeking more than a share.  Had me right for air. 
[02:13:00]  She told me to come, but I was already there.  If the walls was a shaking, the earth was a question for mine.  He was a shaking, we wasn't making it in the air.  She had been all night long.  Let me tell you now, you should be all night long.  Working double time on my seduction line. 
[02:13:30]  She's one of the kind.  She's just mine, oh, mine.  I want no flaw, just a matter of cost.  Made a meal out of me.  Come back on the mall.  Had to pull me down and take a nookie around.  Now I'm back in the ring.  I took it to the swing.  Yeah, the walls was a shaking.  The earth was a quick and her mind was aching.  We were a chicken in the air.  You should be all night long. 
[02:14:00]  I have mercy, Lord, you should be all night long.  You really took me any years.  Opie and Anthony present the best in reality programming starting next Monday.

Hey, Anthony Sam Adams.  People are talking, Tony.  They say I smoked a pink tip white owl.  Uncle June, I can't believe it's you. 
[02:18:30]  They're calling me a butt pirate, Tony.  I demand respect.  Sam Adams, Summer Ale.  It's here.  That's how we started the shenanigans last night.  Jesus.  We were drinking the Summer Ale.  We all went down.  At Bar 9, right?  That's right, Tony.  I like sitting on a bottle of Sam Adams.  Wee says I'm a faggot.  Ah, yes.  Sam Adams Summer Ale.  It's here and it's great.  They got the seasonal beers at Sam Adams.  Junior?  Yes. 
[02:19:00]  I mean, yes.  You like the creamy head?  I always like creamy head.  Doesn't make me a faggot.  Talking about beer, of course, right?  Of course.  Yes.  I'm losing respect, Tony.  What kind of cancer do you have?  I have ass cancer.  The big casino.  I love that.  The big casino.  Yeah, we started out in the office last night.  And, of course, cracking open some icy cold Sam Adams. 
[02:19:30]  Very surprised you're not drinking one right now, Anthony, to put you over the top there.  You know something?  I swear to God, I drank so many shots later.  That at bar nine.  That I really think, okay.  All right.  I got to do it.  You know what's cool?  Someone grabbed me an icy cold Sam Adams.  We're allowed to drink the Sam Adams in the studio now because it's a sponsor.  It's a sponsor.  I can't wait until heroin starts advertising on this show.  Yeah.  Ken's going to come walk in and go, what are you guys doing? 
[02:20:00]  Whoa, we're just supporting the sponsor.  Yeah.  I got to do an authentic read for Sam Adams and tell people how great it tastes, how crisp and refreshing it is.  And we love it.  And Jim Cook, one of our very good friends of the show here, Sam Adams, check out the Summer Ale or any of the Sam Adams beers that are out there,  whether you're out at a bar or you're shopping for home, a few beers for the fridge.  Uncle Junior?  Yes.  You don't like the pink lettuce?  Pink lettuce?  What's that?  Tony. 
[02:20:30]  What?  I'm a faggot, Tony.  Uncle Junior, why did we have to hear from a newspaper, not from you?  I don't know.  I told Dr. Kennedy in the strictest of confidence, Dr. Kennedy's my hero.  He's going to cure me of my ass cancer.  The big casino.  That was no prostate exam you were getting in that doctor's office.  It felt good, Dr. Kennedy.  Dr. Kennedy is gay.  Did you know that?  I know.  That's how the rumors get started, Tony, of me being a faggot. 
[02:21:00]  Carmella's coming over.  You come over.  Carmella's cooking sausage this weekend.  I wear Carmella's clothes, Tony.  I admit it.

[02:22:00]  Look, he writes notes and stuff.  I like that.  I get this stuff.  We get all this oddball stuff on the Daily Show that we don't get to do on the Daily Show,  so I save it for you guys, you know.  There you go.  So the stuff that's not good enough for the Daily Show, you figure you know.  Right.  The second rate.  That's code for the stuff that was rejected.  Wait, are you ready?  Right.  The stuff that Lewis flag.  Give me crap.  Here we go.  No more exploding cows in the Alps.  What?  The Austrian province of Wahlberg will ban the practice of blowing up dead cows with explosives  on its picture postcard in Alpine Meadows. 
[02:22:30]  The cows die.  Yeah.  And they have demolition guys come in and shove...  I heard about this.  I did hear about this.  I swear.  Yes.  We talked to a guy years ago when cows were dropping dead from the heat in the Midwest  like three, four years ago, something like that.  It was a big story in like USA Today that cows actually explode while they're still living  sometimes.  Because of the gas and stuff.  The gas is in them.  So all these cows are laying there dead.  We'll get a farmer on the phone.  They're dead in the heat. 
[02:23:00]  They start bloating up and it's disgusting.  And it costs so much money to get rid of it that they blow the cows up.  It scatters their pieces around and predators come and get it.  It costs a thousand dollars.  It costs a thousand bucks to take it away by helicopter.  It's 32 bucks with the help of demolition experts who place explosives inside the cadet  adverse.  Yeah.  And some people are upset, you know, and it's freaking out, you know, the other cows.  Ah, yeah.  I got it.  And it's perpetuating the problem because the other cows are seeing their buddies blowing 
[02:23:30]  up and they're getting heart attacks and they're dying.  They got blown up.  What would a freaked out cow look like?  I grew up in Wisconsin.  I've seen plenty of cows.  Never once have I seen a freaked out one.  A freaked out cow.  Moo.  You've seen one maybe look of concern on their face, but never freaked out.  It would wrap them in a, what do they call it, a primer cord.  Like this explosive rope.  And they'd wrap them up and boom.  No, they stick it in, man.  To get eaten by a large predator. 
[02:24:00]  And it sounds like fun.  Yeah.  But the closest we went was cow tipping.  Yeah.  I did some of that cow tipping.  Yeah.  Pretty scary.  Yeah.  They get up and chase.  Yeah.  I thought it was all cool until I realized that the cow has reflexes.  What's fun.  And when you're hammered in a field somewhere.  And those feet are flapping around.  Oh, man.  Feet.  Yeah.  Hooves.  Are they hooves?  All right.  We got a guy who grew up on a dairy farm.  All right.  Neil.  Yeah.  What's up?  I grew up on a dairy farm and the cows would get out and they'd get into the young corn. 
[02:24:30]  It's green.  And they'd get so much gas that they would fall down and they'd just blow up.  Nice.  So they wouldn't blow up and explode.  They'd just get huge.  And the vet would come up with a cordless drill and a stainless steel bit with a tube.  Yeah.  You'd find a spot on their side, drill right into their stomach and let the gas out.  That's it.  I'm going to be a dairy farmer.  Wow.  Come on.  Then what happens to the cow?  It now has a hole.  They get up.  They get up and they walk back to the bark.  What about the stomach? 
[02:25:00]  There's a hole in it now.  It would heal up.  Really?  The fence is not like a three-eat fence.  It's only like a pinhole.  But can't you anticipate that's going to happen and keep the cow from...  They break out of the fence.  Oh.  You know, with their...  Close to the sun and all that stuff.  Yeah, because it's too tempting to go out and they smell the corn.  And they're stupid.  They're stupid animals.  And they get too much gas.  They blow up and then you got to pop them.  Oh, jeez.  It starts to ferment.  Right.  It can't ferment.  Because the corn is green. 
[02:25:30]  You got to let it get cold and then you can...  Right.  When they eat the green corn.  Right.  Uncle Junior, that happens to you a lot, doesn't it?  Yes.  Another type of drill.  Tony, drill me, Tony.  I love being drilled.  Don.  I have no respect in the families anymore.  Don, what's going on?  Don.  Yo.  Let's go, man.  Oh, sorry.  You're wrecking our snow.  Hold me napping there, boys.  That's all right.  Let's go.  I got a guy, a buddy of mine that lives out in Thailand. 
[02:26:00]  And one of their pastimes up there, they pay one of the locals to bring him out.  And they shoot RPGs at cows.  Oh, yeah?  No, seriously.  Grenade launchers, basically.  Exactly.  Okay.  And it's to thin out the herd or just for fun?  Um, just for craps and giggles.  Craps and giggles.  Oh, okay.  Or claps and giggles.  Thank you, Don.  Yep.  How can you shoot innocent women and children?  It's easy.  You just don't lead them as much. 
[02:26:30]  Love that.  All right.  We can move on from the cows explosion.  Sure.  Now people are getting silly on the phones.  Yeah.  Very silly.  And you were talking about The Weakest Link, Paul Macerio.  Oh, The Weakest Link.  I saw it last night for the first time.  Did you guys see it?  The Weakest Link.  Hey, Paul.  Oh, my God.  Really?  You know what it is?  It's like if you have a fetish for the sound of music, it's like a dominatrix Julianne.  Oh, wow.  Hey, look at the news.  That's exactly what she is.  Yeah.  Trying to get into bed. 
[02:27:00]  That is The Weakest Link.  Goodbye.  Can I imagine having a good sex with you?  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Yeah, and she looks like a Sally Jesse Raphael.  And she's very hard, very, like, nasty.  It's forced, and she's in black leather, and she's 56, and I want to go on, and I want  to lose.  And you know when you go to a baseball game, they give you those little souvenir bats, and  I want to have those bats in my pant legs, and I want to lose in the first round, and  as she walks by, I just want to whack her in the face with it.  Not to the point where I kill her, but she's so deformed, not even the best plastic surgeon 
[02:27:30]  in the world, and put her face back together, so that she cannot look at herself in the  mirror ever again.  She has to live with the fact that she is The Weakest Link.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  I like her.  You like her?  Mike likes her.  I mean, I haven't seen the show, but I've seen her doing press and stuff.  I think it's cool.  That proves you haven't seen the show, because by the time she says you are The Weakest Link,  goodbye for the 10th time, you want to strangle yourself.  Yeah, I believe that.  I believe that.  Yeah, look at her.  It's like a school mom.  That's Julie Andrews whipping. 
[02:28:00]  You know what I mean?  That's good.  I'm going to think that tonight.  You know what I'm saying?  Next time she's on, you can take those legs, go and plop, little pouches.  Get in there.  With the Matrix leather jacket.  You know, she'd be criticizing you through the whole thing.  Yeah.  What is that you're doing?  This is some of the worst sex I've ever had.  Goodbye.  I'm really giving it my all.  No, you're not.  Totally inadequate.  You call that a penis?  That, sir, is your Weakest Link.  Now, this is a penis. 
[02:28:30]  You know, she's not one.  Give it to me, Tony.  Right, right.  Where's the penis?  I heard about penis.  Oh, man.  She just treats people and they take it.  She treats them like they're three-year-olds and they just take it.  It's just so like, how badly do you want to be on television?  You're obviously a moron.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, whatever you say.  On my walk of shame, I'll kind of put my arm back like, yeah, I showed you.  You are so stupid, we are going to give you cancer in the green room after this. 
[02:29:00]  Okay.  We are going to inject you with the HIV virus.  Okay.  They take it.  Yeah, they take it because they're famous.  People like being famous.  Seriously, get a small bat right in the bridge of the nose.  There you have it.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, this is open or Anthony?  Hey, both.  How are you guys doing?  Anthony, you know when you go to like a prize fight and all of a sudden the undercard steals the show?  Yeah.  That's how it was.  I went to see Brian Regan and Paul Mercurio was on the stage. 
[02:29:30]  This guy is awesome, man.  Paul rocks.  Oh, my God.  Thank you.  Oh, yeah.  Paul's very good.  He's playing Rascals this weekend.  Yeah, I'm going to be there.  So I'm going to be a great job, man.  You don't have to insult another comic.  You give one a compliment.  Yeah, you can still.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  You know what you got to do really fast?  Oh, no.  We were all at this bar nine last night.  Mike DeNicola was there.  And Anthony was doing his ex-mother-in-law doing Brian Regan.  Judy Regan. 
[02:30:00]  Judy Regan.  I love a box of wine.  She is a box with wine in it.  I call it a box of wine.  Box of wine.  The big yellow one is the sun.  The big yellow one is the sun.  The big stupid one is my son-in-law.  How many?  I want a 12-pack of beer. 
[02:30:30]  I already have eight.  How many more beers do I need, liquor star lady?  Tell me that one, liquor star lady.  Oh, no.  I can't make a left hand chin.  Oh, no.  Three rides make a left.  Or how about, let me start doing Judy Dice Clay.  How do you take it?  Medium or well done.  Medium wrap? 
[02:31:00]  Well, yeah.  I want to go home.  I want to go home.  I want to go home.  It's only 8.30.  I don't care.  I want to go home.  I have my grandma and my scotch, and now I've got to get you my box of wine and cigarettes.  Hey, Louis.  How are you doing?  We're losing our effing minds today, Louis Black.  Louis Black!  There he is.  Hey, baby.  Hey.  Vote for me. 
[02:31:30]  It's Schmuck.  Where are you?  I'm in Boston.  Ah.  That's why I called.  Boston.  I'm here in the town that destroyed those two.  Yeah.  The town that didn't care.  Say hi to my mother-in-law.  I want to go home.  Louis, if you remember one thing, it's this.  You are the weakest link.  Goodbye.  Oh, God.  Yeah, that's what we needed.  Yeah.  That's what we needed was that show.  Another one.  You like the weakest link, Louis? 
[02:32:00]  No, I don't.  What am I?  I saw it in Europe, and I said, oh, this show will never fly.  Silly you.  See?  Silly you.  Investment.  Unbelievable.  Where are you working in Boston?  I'm working at Tufts University.  Ooh.  Look at you.  It's a big day.  Oh, yeah.  Woo-hoo.  Ha-ha.  They get you sleeping in a dorm.  What's their mascot?  Jumbo.  It's a big elephant.  Yeah.  Get a grip.  They used to have it. 
[02:32:30]  I found out today.  I came up here once.  I saw this elephant.  It's stuffed.  Okay?  They have a stuffed elephant there?  They used to.  That's a building burnt down.  Now they keep its ashes in an urn.  An actual stuffed animal, stuffed elephant.  Yeah.  It was P.T. Barnum's elephant.  Oh, it was a real deal, and they stuffed it.  I was saying, you know.  I thought you guys would know this.  No.  Yeah, we're going to know anything.  Well, you know, you guys used to be, it was all Boston this, Boston that.  When I first met you. 
[02:33:00]  It was all a lie.  Yeah, we had to fake it.  That's what you do when you go to a new city.  You make believe you like the team.  Lewis, how are you doing in the voting that's going on for the funniest guy ever on the planet?  I think that's the one.  I have no idea.  Comedy Central is doing the little comedy voting thing that you do.  Who are you up to?  Yeah, the American comedy.  It's always nice to be put in that position of running against people you like.  You pit you against fellow comics.  Come on, you called in for yourself like a dozen times already, you told me. 
[02:33:30]  Uh-huh.  No, you can't, piggy boy.  Okay, Mr. Smarty Pants.  Yes, you did.  And how do you know you can't?  You won't be a spirit in your life.  There you go.  Hold on, there's a guy that wants to talk about Tufts University.  Adam.  Yeah.  What's up?  Lewis is playing at Tufts tonight.  Yeah, I went to Tufts.  I graduated in 98.  That place, man.  You guys better watch yourself, Lewis.  There's hot guys there, though.  Huh?  Tony, hot guys.  No, lots of guys.  I spent the weekend up there. 
[02:34:00]  And they're young.  They don't mind the ass cancer.  I love the F-truck.  They like to protest.  Oh, yeah?  Norm Macdonald was up there.  You know, he was a mess on stage.  He was funny.  But, yeah, they protested because he was making fun of everyone.  All right, Adam, thanks.  You have a lot of fun with me, then, won't you?  Yes, you have.  Oh, absolutely.  I wish I was still there.  I should be disappointing them within eight minutes. 
[02:34:30]  Hey, Lewis, you seem pretty happy today.  Well, you know, I'm not.  What's wrong?  What's wrong today?  What's wrong today?  Yeah.  What's wrong today?  What isn't wrong?  How's your polyp?  Oh, I've still got it.  Is it moving around still?  It's still moving around.  You've got a polyp?  It changes shape.  It's in your stomach, right?  I think it's a little man.  I think it's me trying to be pregnant.  I think it's part of Uncle Junior, isn't you? 
[02:35:00]  Go to Dr. Kennedy.  He's the best.  Dr. Kennedy is a saint.  I hope it's not the big casino.  No, I think it's...  I don't.  I think it's a baby.  I think I'm having a baby.  Well, what are they doing for it?  Are they going to shrink it down or something?  No, they don't know what to do.  They just look at it and go, you know, you're better off if we don't look to see what it is.  2001, you've been talking to me about this for six weeks.  They're not going to do anything to it.  You know, they say it's a virus.  Lewis, maybe it's your long-lost twin brother, and an arm's going to pop out of your stomach soon. 
[02:35:30]  A conjoined twin.  Or just another mouth.  Right.  Try a laxative.  I can just talk to my belly.  How are you guys doing?  Life's good.  Paul Mercurio is killing today, man.  Is he really?  I'm sorry to interrupt him.  No, that's all right.  We love it.  Hey, your swanky new apartment's empty if you're out of town.  Can we go over there and do some stuff?  No, but that thing, it's got, like, double locks.  Security?  It's got guys in front with machine guns.  New place?  Does this mean it has heat?  Oh, yeah, it's got everything. 
[02:36:00]  Oh, he's so sold out.  Look at you.  Did he?  Oh, my God.  He moved out of a little crap ball.  Lewis Black sold out and got some heat.  That only took 500 years.  You're such a sellout.  You're such a sellout in history.  With the heat and the landline telephone.  You are such a sellout, man.  The running water.  The landline telephone as opposed to a Dixie cup?  Did you leave health care?  The shit I'd be using, Mercurio.  We don't know you anymore.  You've got running water.  Yeah, you better not get happy.  Oh, yeah, I'm really ecstatic.  All I found out, you know what I found out? 
[02:36:30]  What?  Rich people are bigger pigs than I thought they were.  Right.  That's what I've discovered.  What, in your building?  All over the place.  Stand in my building and during tax time.  Oh, how many pigs can we give you, Mr. Black?  Oh, God.  Now that you have money, what can we do?  Let's fend over for you.  We didn't have a dime.  All right.  You know?  All right.  I just figured it out.  Of course, tax season just passed.  Yeah, it was great, wasn't it?  You didn't do too well this year, huh? 
[02:37:00]  No, I did fine.  Why?  Because I have money now.  You can all scam away when you've got money.  Oh, dear, let's establish this for you, Mr. Black.  Lewis, isn't that the American dream, though?  It's not the American dream.  We're the only country that protects the rich.  You're since apartheid, and they had guys with dogs beating people away.  I think...  The rich people have been protected like this.  I kind of think it's nice that this country rewards you for doing well.  I agree. 
[02:37:30]  You are a lunatic.  You are completely psychotic.  You bought into the system.  Look at you.  You're getting paid tonight to work at Tufts, aren't you?  What are you getting bought into the system?  Where are you supposed to go?  Go out at Subway with a can?  You're the option.  If you believe in these socialist theories of yours, practice what you preach.  Give that money to me.  What am I supposed to do?  God, I'm...  You know what am I supposed to do?  Pay for your kid's education?  Is that what you think?  I don't know.  I don't see...  Hey, I'm a socialist, and the fact that there are only six of us, what am I going to do? 
[02:38:00]  I'm in a doomed political party.  Ready for the revolution when you hit eight.  You're maybe actually seven.  I think that polyp is a socialist.  I don't understand how you can be upset.  Everybody says, you know, when you moved into a new apartment, will that change the way  you look at things?  Yeah.  What it means is if they do come along and want to burn the apartment down, I'm going  to go outside and help them.  I don't see how you get upset by getting a lot of tax breaks when you get in a higher  tax bracket than you did.  You know what?  Because when I didn't have anything, I got no tax breaks. 
[02:38:30]  Well, the...  They couldn't wait to get the six cents there.  Oh, Mr. Brock, we're going to bust into your house.  We're going to take your stab.  Oh, so it should be, you're doing very well in this country, you're using this country  in what it has to offer to the best of your ability, you're making money, so let's penalize  you.  Not penalize me, but you don't penalize poor people.  We protect rich people more than we protect poor people.  Then why shouldn't we?  If we could, we would gather them up and put them in a dustbin.  That would be nice.  Why shouldn't we take care of... 
[02:39:00]  You are perfect.  I wish I had that on tape.  That would be nice.  It's beyond Rush Limbaugh.  It's called thinning the herd.  Yes.  Unbelievable.  I agree in thinning the herd, but that's people who, when the sign, you know, says,  don't go into the bridge, there might be water, and they drive in, okay?  They get it.  That I get.  He's mad at himself for doing well.  They just don't thin people out because they can't make money.  Yes, you are.  Yeah, my goal has got a point.  You are pissed at yourself for doing well.  You can't come to terms with the fact that you're a success. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah, it's that comedic self-hatred thing.  You're afraid of failure.  Afraid of success.  You know what?  Maybe I should hire you three as my shrink.  So that I could kill myself by next 30 days.  You need a team of shrinks at the university level to help you.  Yeah.  Lewis, why don't you get some roommates?  Some less fortunate roommates.  Help them out a little bit.  Excellent point.  That's not the deal.  You don't do that.  Why not?  Why not?  I can see Lewis looking in the mirror. 
[02:40:00]  Looking in the mirror just going, you scumbag.  No, I don't.  I do that.  He doesn't have to say it.  He thanks for it.  I work on the road with him.  Every time he gets paid on the road, he takes the money physically in his hand,  and then he punches himself in the nuts.  Punches himself in the nuts.  Capitalist pig.  You should have just cut yourself.  Make yourself a cutter.  Lewis is a cutter.  Lewis is a cutter.  Yeah, they're doing after school special.  You should have to convert some of these tough students tonight into your way of thinking. 
[02:40:30]  Nobody's going to listen to the way I'm thinking.  They're not interested.  You know?  Well, with that cheery demeanor, I can't imagine why.  No, let's forget that.  Let's be sure that six people have 500 Lexuses.  They're like crack addicts.  I want to have 19 homes.  That'll make me happy.  I'd like servants everywhere.  Nothing's going to make you happy.  I'd like to be 85 years old, live in a house that's 15,000 square feet,  and touch myself all day.  Yeah, you beat the odds.  You're making an effload of money, 
[02:41:00]  and yeah, you should be penalized for that.  Yeah, sure.  I didn't say penalized.  Well, what are you...  My God.  You're saying the government should take more money.  They certainly have got to stop whining about the fact that they're paying too much.  Well, you live in a 2,500 square foot apartment and touching yourself.  Isn't that enough for you?  No, it's not 2,500 square foot.  By paying the taxes that rich people pay, they should get the big houses  and shouldn't be persecuted by the likes of Louis Black.  I'm the only one who's saying anything.  You're acting like I've got an army behind me. 
[02:41:30]  You argue with me as if there are other people who believe this.  I am the only one.  Well, that's because it sounds nuts, Louis.  That's why you're the only one.  It's freezing all winter.  But aren't you happier in your bigger apartment, honestly?  Oh, yeah.  No kidding.  And you hate that you're happy.  Before, as I said, when I was in my other apartment,  in order to achieve an erection,  I'd have to imagine I was in a nicer place. 
[02:42:00]  Now you just look at the leopard-skin rug on the floor you're living in.  He's a socialist, but he likes being comfortable.  Well, of course.  Of course.  Even socialists need some luxury items.  But the whole country could be comfortable.  But not according to you.  Oh, all comfortable.  Just like the Soviet Union, they were comfortable.  No, for God's sake.  You're talking about a country that didn't even...  Look, my family came from that, you know, hellhole. 
[02:42:30]  They arrived in the United States in 1907.  They didn't know they were here until 65.  We're not talking about geniuses over there.  We're way ahead here.  So if you're working, you should...  If you're rich, you should divvy up that money among the people that really need it.  No, no, no.  I don't understand how this socialism would work.  Well, I'm going to get you some films.  Get me some films.  Get some hygiene ones, too.  I like those.  Hey, Lewis.  Hey, Lewis, when you do these rants on the phone, are you poking the sky anyway, even though no one can see you? 
[02:43:00]  Are you resting your fingers for the show?  Right.  Yeah, his fingers are in ice.  Yeah, he's got it in a bowl of lotion.  Right.  A pelvic pillow.  Tell them what happens...  That is raw.  Lewis, we know what happens.  Tell them what happens 20 minutes before the show.  You get a manicure, right?  Oh, yeah, I get...  You do?  No.  Oh.  I like to have a colonic.  His hands have to look...  The opener gives him the colonic.  The middle act has to give him the manicure. 
[02:43:30]  A manicure.  Oh, God.  Hey, did you get my message that I left you?  Yes, that was very nice.  Okay.  Did you get my second one?  What was it?  I'll get that out of the way.  You want to work in...  I think it was Idaho, and you'll be working there.  I'm going to have you set up really good.  Well, Lewis, have fun tonight in Boston.  Thanks.  Bad.  And thanks for pushing for me on this thing.  Cool.  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  Go to ComedyCentral.com. 
[02:44:00]  I guess you get the number there.  And remember, vote for Karl Marx.  You are unbelievable.  Just remember, every dollar you make makes you a lesser person.  Oh, man.  You know, you guys, you look at me.  You know, next time I come in, I'm going to wear a Chinese communist uniform.  Yeah, you should.  I would laugh my ass off.  Yeah, it's like Mao Zedong.  Take off that $5,000 leather jacket that you wear and put on a papier-mâché jacket.  I'd love to see that.  I don't know how many people I can feed.  Oh, man. 
[02:44:30]  You guys, it's like, oh, God.  I'm exhausted.  Now I can take my nap.  All right, Lewis.  Hey, guys, take care.  Take it easy, man.  Thank you, buddy.  All right.  Bye, guys.  Take care.  There goes Lewis Black.  We're really late.  We've got to take a break.  All right, man.  More with Paul Mercurio in just a bit.  You guys, some conflict.  Kiss me off, okay?  We'll lay, we'll lay, we'll do it.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  Hi, Anthony Victory Limousine.  I love D-Nicola's take on pregnancy.  Yeah, it was...  Just put him away somewhere for the nine months.

No, I'm the acting boss, Uncle June.  Tony, I'm going to lay on the floor.  I want a hot lunch.  I want a Cleveland steamer.  Like they did in the old days.  Uncle June, I gave you my junk yesterday.  Come on.  I want a Cleveland steamer, Tony.

[02:50:00]  The big casino.  We have Psycho Mark checking back in.  Yeah.  Calling Collect from Jamaica, which is just driving Ken Stevens, our boss.  He's insane today.  North, north, north.  Smoking weed.  Doing cold, drinking beers.  Keep your ass off, brother man.  Get, get, get, get, get, get.  If possible, Mark, you sound more effed up than you did before.  Yeah.  Hey, don't figure, huh?  If you talk to your doctor about massive marijuana, I guess who's sitting with me right now? 
[02:50:30]  Oh.  Kat from the Best Breast Contest.  Oh, yeah.  This is what she was.  From the Best Breast Contest?  But if you talk to your doctor about breasts.  Dude, I'm effed up.  Forget about it.  She wanted to say hi and thank you, guys.  Is Kat getting topless for everyone down there in Jamaica?  I don't know, but not yet.  See, it's sort of been low-key.  Last night we just got here, so we're warming up.  Tonight's going to be a big party, and then Friday night it's 4.20, so naturally, say no more. 
[02:51:00]  Say no more.  Say no more.  But anyhow, she wanted to say hi real quick.  Here, hold on.  All right.  Hello.  Hey, Kat.  How are you?  Hey, good.  How are you guys?  The winner of our Best Boob Contest.  Yes.  And look what she won.  She gets to hang out with Psycho Mark and smoke wine pot.  Yes, all week.  Only the best prizes for our listeners.  Of course.  Having the best time now.  You've got to cut this short and go get him munchies.  Yes.  Is Mark trying to bang you?  No, he's being a perfect gentleman. 
[02:51:30]  Oh.  He's going to roll you up in a sheet and smoke you at midnight.  No, but, you know, we're up in his room, so you never know.  You're up in his room?  Of course.  Trust me, you'll never know.  Are you partaking in the festivities down there?  Of course we are.  Oh, man.  It's just a matter of time.  What are the odds that Psycho Mark gets a piece?  From me?  Yeah.  Or from anybody?  From you.  From me?  That's a yes, sir.  Yes.  Wow.  You're as good as pregnant.  Congratulations. 
[02:52:00]  Nice.  Nice.  No, but we have a few dancers down here, so you never know.  All right.  We'll see.  Well, can we talk to Psycho Mark?  Of course we can.  Hold on a second.  Have a good time, Kat.  Hello.  Jesus, man.  Hey, hey, what's this?  The FBI?  What are you guys interrogating here today?  What?  Just interrogating.  Oh, what?  What?  We were helping you out, Mark.  Oh, yeah.  Like, I need your help, please.  I'm down here.  Forget about it.  Hey, Mark, how many times has she turned you down?  We'll see.  That's the point.

[02:53:00]  Too fun.  Kathy's going to give it up to me.  You know, Junior was also in Dog Day Afternoon.  Was he really?  Yeah.  He was in The Godfather Part II.  He played Johnny Ola.  And then he was the father in Dog Day Afternoon.  That's how he got turned to the other side of the light there.  Dog Day Afternoon.  Yeah.  Yes.  Al Pacino.  Al Pacino was a fag in that.  Yes.  And what an ass.  Tony, you've got to come on.  Every time you do Uncle Junior, he yells, Attica, Attica. 
[02:53:30]  You've got to give me that one, Tony.  Yeah.  I'm just looking at everything he's done.  My God.  Hey, there's this doctor in Hong Kong.  He's done everything.  You hear about this doctor in Hong Kong who's operating on somebody,  and he took a cell phone call while he's operating on somebody?  Really?  Come on.  Talked for 14 minutes.  What was he operating?  What was he operating?  Serious?  That's okay.  I'm not asking you.  I'm better than that.  I'm not asking you.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm too relaxed. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah, he's a Hong Kong surgeon.  He took a phone call.  He was performing intestinal surgery on a guy.  Yes, for the ass cancer.  Don't take a cell phone.  Dr. Kennedy would never have done that, Tony.  I want to talk to Dr. Kennedy.  Go to the golf course and find him.  And don't touch the thermostat.  The best-ass cancer doctor out there.  And apparently he was talking about buying a new car, 
[02:54:30]  and he didn't hang out for 14 minutes.  He didn't hang out for 14 minutes.  And the guy could kind of still hear him because he was, like, half on him.  Oh!  And he's just going to town on the guy.  Yeah, shouldn't he just have been out?  Well, they, you know, decided, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Why bother?  I mean, if you're going to let the guy take phone calls during an operation.  The guy was taking faxes from his ass at the same time.  I could do that, Tony.  For you.  My ass is your fax machine. 
[02:55:00]  So then they had a hearing.  They had a hearing, and they brought the guy up on charges,  and they said there was no problem, and they let it continue.  So if you go to Hong Kong, you can get surgery.  The guy can talk on the phone and watch it.  Look at that.  And you said the patient was awake?  The patient was semi-awake.  Semi-conscious?  Semi-conscious, yeah.  Wow.  So I think thank you for having me.  Have you been drinking with Psycho-Mart?  Oh, my God.  Tony, I think Ralphie's sweet on me. 
[02:55:30]  I think he likes me.  Don't hurt him.  He's kind of cute.  He's got some nice guns.  You know, you just wrecked the Sopranos for me.  I'm not going to be able to watch something.  I'm going to be laughing my ass off.  Some fun lines.  You want to play What Did We Learn and Get Out of Here, or what?  I think it was an educational show today.  I might be wrong.  In case we get sidetracked, we want to thank Paul Mercurio for stopping by.  Hey, thanks, guys.  He's playing Rascals this weekend.  He writes for the Daily Show.  He's very, very funny.  I always hated Big Pussy. 
[02:56:00]  I don't know why.  I couldn't stand him, Tony.  You were uncomfortable around him, right, Uncle Jim?  I was always uncomfortable around Big Pussy.  You wanted to change his name at one point.  And his son, Little Pussy.  I just don't like any of them.  No more.  No big pussy.  No little pussy.  No more pussy, Tony. 
[02:56:30]  You wanted to call him what?  Big Shaft?  Let's go, Jason.  We'll start this off here.  Jason, what's going on?  What's going on, guys?

Let's go to Dennis.  Dennis, what's going on?  There you go.  Well, I learned today that calling everybody a fig is the first sign of Alzheimer's.

Former Curio is the funniest effing lawyer I've ever heard.  Hey.  Thank you very much.  You're a lawyer?  Heck.  No.  Oh, you're back.  Please leave.  Thank you, man.  How do you go from a lawyer to comedy?  Not hard. 
[02:59:00]  Pathetic, pathetic life.  Thanks, man.  I appreciate it.  Cool.  Right on.  Let's move on to Kurt.  Kurt, what's going on?  Hey.  How are you doing, guys?

You cried that you weren't in it.  Now with the ass cancer, I wake up with Chuck-A-Lot in my bed.  Tony, help me.  So when it comes to movies, you like Blow, but you didn't like Snatch?  No, I hated Snatch.  Right.  Tony.  Get me fried green tomatoes.

I learned that Paul Mercurio isn't even wasting his time with the Tony Soprano impression.  He's not even wasting his time.  Like, not even wasting his time.  He goes, Mercurio, not even trying to impersonate Tony.  I started for like a minute and then just said, you know what?  I bother.  That means they're showing you love, Paul. 
[03:02:00]  I see.  When listeners abuse you, they're showing love.  Thanks, man.  That's funny, though, man.  All right.  There's a lot here.  All right.  We can keep going with Steve, I guess.

I learned Louis Black now has 25,000 square feet of utter despair.  And for mobile.  And once again, we would allow the guy to say what he wanted to say.  We're not dumping out.
