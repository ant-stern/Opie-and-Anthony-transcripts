<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony XM Satellite Radio show opened with Opie’s furious rant about a disastrous Vegas trip, blaming Don Wicklund for a series of flight cancellations and booking errors that stretched his journey to 16 hours, culminating in a private car ride to retrieve his own vehicle.  He detailed the chaotic travel experience and sent an email to Eric Logan and others outlining his grievances.  This was followed by discussion of their recent Tonight Show appearance with Jay Leno, which garnered multiple mentions of the show.

A significant portion focused on Howard Stern's daughter, Emily Stern, and her nude appearance in an off-Broadway play.  Opie and Anthony played audio clips from the play and launched a listener remix contest, emphasizing that the "dirtier the better."  They also discussed Imus’s seemingly sarcastic plea for them to leave Emily alone, pointing out the irony given their past coverage of similar topics.  Throughout this segment, and indeed the entire show, the hosts used frequent and explicit vulgar language.  Comedian Bill Burr was a guest in the studio, filling in for Jim Norton.

Next, the show featured "Pat from Minaki's Cribs," a parody of MTV Cribs showcasing a listener’s dilapidated trailer home.  Pat called in, humorously describing his living conditions, which included falling refrigerator magnets and a poorly executed "Cribs" ending.  Listener donations for Pat and another listener, "Stalker Patty," were discussed, alongside a call from a general contractor offering to help renovate Pat's seemingly beyond-repair trailer. This was followed by a retrospective on the hosts’ vehement opposition to XM Satellite Radio commercials airing on their previous terrestrial radio show.  Audio clips were played showcasing their on-air outbursts against these commercials, including a phone call with their general manager, Ken Stevens. They discussed their prescient understanding of satellite radio's potential threat to terrestrial radio, contrasting their view with their former employer's short-sightedness. A listener-created satirical anti-terrestrial radio ad was also mentioned, along with a brief discussion and playing of a Pat O'Brien sex tape remix.  Bill Burr remained in studio.

The show continued with a discussion about the hypocrisy of commercial radio's reaction to satellite radio, highlighting how they initially ignored, then advertised for, and finally created antagonistic commercials against their competitor, despite likely having financial ties to satellite radio.  Listener-submitted parody commercials, often highly offensive, were played, alongside audio clips of celebrity endorsements for commercial radio, particularly those by Jon Bon Jovi and the Rolling Stones, which the hosts ridiculed. A PR representative who worked on the Bon Jovi ads called in, claiming the ads targeted MP3 players, not satellite radio.  A caller compared this to similar industry shifts in construction and luggage.  The conversation shifted to Bill Burr's upcoming shows and his daughter's acting, interspersed with more explicit listener-submitted commercials.  The hosts then discussed Kelly LeBrock’s weight gain and appearance on *Celebrity Fit Club*, with several callers offering crude and sexually charged comments.  A call with Ed Asner was abruptly ended by a producer using sign language, leading to comedic banter.  The segment concluded with discussions of a "Bathroom Olympics" contest, rising postage costs, and future show segments. Bill Burr remained in the studio throughout.

A segment heavily focused on Jeff Conaway’s behavior on *Celebrity Fit Club*, using audio clips showcasing his angry and slurred speech, speculating about substance abuse, and mentioning other cast members like Countess Vaughn and Tempest Bledsoe. This transitioned into a discussion of Wafa Dufour (Osama bin Laden's niece) and her GQ photoshoot, along with calls from listeners sharing stories about relatives with infamous names like Hitler and Stalin. The show ended with a bit where the hosts speculated on the actual stories behind vague and sensationalized local news teases, referencing Bizarre (from D12) and Bruce Valanche.

Finally, a segment started with an animal guessing game (the answer was a pig) before moving back to *Celebrity Fit Club* audio clips of Jeff Conaway exhibiting slurred speech and apparent intoxication, where he offered various explanations.  Concern for his condition was expressed.  Listener calls, mentions of other *Celebrity Fit Club* cast members (Kelly LeBrock and Flavor Flav), a listener-submitted bit of a child reenacting a past segment, and comedian show reviews were included.  The segment ended with a brief mention of Bill Burr’s scheduled appearance the following week.

[00:04:30]  Oh, what a glorious day.  It's all about me.  I play golf with old guys.  I am a grinning idiot.  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony, we're back now with the new cloud of the radio.  Ho, ho, Opie.  Shut up!  Thank you.  You don't go to CNN for dick jokes, you don't go to CNN for dick jokes, don't come to O and A for hard-hitting news.  I love Opie and Anthony.

[00:05:00]  We stink.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Georgia!  That's Georgia!  What are you people?  On dope?  Talk on and on about how you invented radio.  So fresh.  Oh, you like that, don't you, faggot?  Hey bud, what's your problem? 
[00:05:30]  You dick!  This is the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio.  It's a virus.  The ONA virus spreading across America thanks to XM Satellite Radio.  Getting more gooder every day, right, Ant?  Of course it is.  Hi.  How are you?  Doing good.  Bill Burr in studio for Jimmy.  What's up? 
[00:06:00]  Jimmy back in Hollywood.  Doing the HBO thing for like three weeks.  Doing his Hollywood thing.  Doing that stupid little Hollywood thing.  Hey, what's he doing, huh?  Some dumb little TV show.  Yeah, whatever.  He'll make them millions.  What the fuck is he thinking?  At this point we're entertaining the world.  He's doing his cute little HBO show.  Isn't that nice?  On that little network.  On that little network called HBO.  At little HBO.  I haven't seen clip one.  Not stitch one of that show. 
[00:06:30]  We're here on a daily basis.  Trying to put out product.  And he talks about this show a lot.  He takes a lot of time off.  But I don't know.  For all I know, he could just be out there fucking around.  Yeah, getting hookers.  Horsing around.  Getting hookers.  Exactly.  I want to start by saying I've never been more tired in my life.  And I blame Don Wicklin.  Oh yes, I still blame you, Don.  Yes.  Oh yes, I still blame you.  Yes.  You're going to be puking all day today. 
[00:07:00]  Had a little trouble on the...  A little.  On the flight back, did you?  A little.  Well, now I got something going on up here in my chest area.  Yeah.  This area right here.  Why am I doing a Dane Cook?  I want to feel like a Dane Cook with my hand motions.  This area.  How he does that.  Jesus.  We can't.  It's the goddamn traveling.  Don't the fucking joke, will you? 
[00:07:30]  I like Dane Cook.  I'm just fucking...  I know.  I was going to say I'd love to criticize him, but...  No, I like him.  But you sell out with a friggin' Nets play.  Yeah.  And there's really nothing I can say at that point.  I understand.  It's the goddamn...  The goddamn traveling is what it is.  It destroyed me.  And you can call me a wimp.  You can call me whatever.  I don't give a shit at this point.  I'm beyond tired.  My time in Vegas, I'm not going to lie to you, sucked.  I never caught up.  I never had energy.  We talked about it on the show when I got out there. 
[00:08:00]  It took me 16 hours to get to Vegas.  Vegas, you had the hell ride to Vegas.  Which, whatever, things happen.  But when you go to the airport at 5 in the morning, you assume that the tickets that were  booked for you are going to be there waiting for you.  And when you find out at like 5, 5.15 in the morning that one of your tickets was canceled,  that would throw you into a bit of a tizzy.  Make a long story short, I had to take all my stuff from LaGuardia, drive, I just happened  to have my car to JFK, which isn't a quick little ride. 
[00:08:30]  No.  Unless it's the middle of the night when there's no cars on the road.  Then it's a quick little ride.  And then I got on another flight from JFK.  Had to pass Vegas where the pilot is actually going, look out the left side of the plane  and you'll see Vegas.  I'm like, great, that's where I have to be.  Look out of the left side of the aircraft.  You're going to see where Opie wants to be right about now.  But he's not going to be for another, let me check, about 8 more hours.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I had to fly all the way to LA to go back to Vegas. 
[00:09:00]  And I had to wait in LA for the next plane to go back to Vegas.  Make a long story short, I bored the listeners with this when I was in Vegas.  It took me 16 hours to get to Vegas, door to door.  And it just destroyed me.  16 hours?  Between the time difference and all that, I just never had a rhythm out there.  And I didn't have fun, nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  And then here's the deal.  Now my car is at JFK Airport, okay? 
[00:09:30]  So I talked to Don Wicklund.  I'm like, Don, I need to get back to JFK Airport.  And he goes, no problem, I'll take care of this, okay?  So we went back and forth for two or three days deciding on what flight I'm going to take on Saturday.  And he assures me that if I take the, what was it, the 1220 out of Vegas to Houston,  then it would be Houston to JFK.  I'm like, great, all right.  I'm still bummed out about how I got out to Vegas.  Couldn't get a direct flight? 
[00:10:00]  That's a whole other story.  Because XM, for some reason, likes to book everything last minute.  I don't get that one.  But yeah, that works well every single time.  You hear, Bill?  You couldn't get a direct flight to Vegas?  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  That's what we said to these people, and they thought we were crazy for bringing it up.  You're crazy.  No, that's what happened.  Like, one time I had to go to L.A., and I was in Denver, and I had to fly to St. Louis  and then go all the way to L.A.  So you literally fly two hours in the wrong direction?  Yeah.  Yeah, just to go back to where you need to be.  Right.  Oh, they had us going to Utah for a while. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, Utah in the winter.  That's a safe flight.  So, and every second you're on the plane that you're passing your destination, you're just  sitting there going, now here's the waste of time, time.  This is just a complete waste of fucking time.  Yeah.  Destination behind me.  You can just jump out, parachute out of the plane.  Yeah.  I'm leaving my destination behind me at a few hundred miles an hour at a clip, and every  minute we're going this way, and it's going to be an hour. 
[00:11:00]  Great.  And for the new listeners, they're like, what's the big deal?  Shit happens.  But they've been fucking up our travel since coming to XM.  Like, I can't, we have a whole list of things that have happened since coming to XM as far  as traveling goes.  So we go back and forth on the BlackBerry for two days.  He goes, yeah, the 1220 flight, we'll get you to Houston, then Houston, JFK, no problem.  I'm like, all right, book me.  I'm there.  All right.  So I go to the airport on Saturday morning.  I get there around, I don't know, I guess right around 10 a.m. or so.  And I go up to the desk, and I'm all happy. 
[00:11:30]  He's like, all right, at least I'm going to get home to my car, and I could, you know,  drive from there.  And I go, you know, I decide to check at that point.  Yeah, so I got a Continental flight from Vegas to Houston, and then Houston to JFK.  The guy looks at me like I have two heads.  He goes, JFK?  JFK?  There's not many flights on Continental directly to JFK.  That's very rare.  I'm like, you're kidding, right?  I thought, like, now it's Anthony and the guys and Norton and everyone just fucking with 
[00:12:00]  me because of how awful my travel was to Vegas.  No, it's Newark and LaGuardia, or Continental.  He goes, JFK?  Hey, everyone knows pretty much that we don't fly to JFK.  Well, they do, but, like, it's very minimal.  I'm like, you've got to be fucking kidding me, right?  The terminal's out.  You've got to go kind of around.  You see the dumpster?  Go around there.  Let's go to Joe.  He makes a good point.  I'll give it to him.  Joe, go ahead. 
[00:12:30]  I'm going to put myself out there, Opie.  You worked for four hours over five days, and probably nine days over the last two and  a half weeks.  Oh, yeah.  No, here's the deal.  I'm glad we're back into a rhythm, finally, because the last three weeks have been fucked  up.  We've been doing a show here, doing a show there, changing the schedule here.  It's going to be nice to get into that.  Dude, I'm not going to tell you that we went out there to work hard.  We were looking at this as a nice little break from the action, because we did work through  the holidays.  You know, most radio shows didn't work through the holidays, so to us it was like, yeah, 
[00:13:00]  do two two-hour shows and then enjoy ourselves in Vegas.  What I'm trying to tell you is I never got a chance to really enjoy Vegas, because I just  I was just exhausted from the ridiculous travel.  I did it for you.  Thank you.  Because you didn't bite my head off, man.  Punch it out.  All right, Joe.  No, Joe makes a good point.  So I'm like, it's not flying.  So to make a long story short, my trip was...  Where did they dump you off?  Vegas, Houston, Houston to LaGuardia.  Now I have to go...  Now, after flying all day, I have to get my car at JFK. 
[00:13:30]  So you had to drive from LaGuardia...  LaGuardia and a taxi cab flying.  Well...  Take a cab from LaGuardia to JFK.  Manhattan?  Why?  See, what happened at that point, a real man took over the situation and Eric Logan made  sure I had a car at LaGuardia, like a real man, like figured out there was a problem  and then I'm...  Because you called him up and made such a pleasant phone call to you.  Oh, yeah.  No.  Eric Logan is just as pissed off as I am.  So...  Okay.  See, because I told the guys around here, I'm not stupid.  I know I get a reputation for being an asshole, but this one, no way. 
[00:14:00]  No one's blaming me for being an asshole.  Eric Logan was beyond pissed, too.  And because he's a real man, he took care of the situation.  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous.  All right.  Don Wicklin, I'm on the plane, now pissed off that I'm going to LaGuardia, right?  And I get a phone call and I get an email on my BlackBerry.  He, as they're closing the doors on the plane, he announces that he now found me a flight from 
[00:14:30]  Houston to JFK.  I'm like...  And then the stewardess is looking at me going, what?  It's not feasible to get your bags off this plane.  Yeah, the connection time.  And there's no way we could guarantee that your bags will make it to JFK.  I'm like, holy shit, he's making it even worse.  So I got...  That's when I got on the phone with Eric Logan.  I go, will you tell this fucking asshole to stop?  We have...  To stop?  We have Elo talking with Don right here.  You can act like a man! 
[00:15:00]  What's the matter with you?  I didn't think he had to get physical like that.  So apparently he slapped him in the face.  So at that point, Eric Logan took over, because that's what real men do.  And he got me a car, like literally as private driver.  So when I got off the plane, there was a ride waiting for me.  Because I mentioned this, because you mentioned the cab line.  Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit.  If they didn't have a car for me after this fiasco and I had to wait in that cab line,  it went on for days. 
[00:15:30]  And those people are like, this sucks, but they're getting a ride to their homes.  I would have had to wait on that cab line just to go to another airport to get my fucking car.  So it added about an hour and a half onto my fine travel.  I wish I had the audio of you muttering to yourself going to the airport.  Oh, sons of bitches.  Fucking motherfuckers.  Motherfuckers knocking over kids.  Oh, it's just angry.  You just get angry.  You wish I had the voice.  Well, here, this is fun when we get to let everyone in on some stuff. 
[00:16:00]  Let's see here.  That happened to me when I was coming back from Livonia, Michigan.  Ah, New Year's in Livonia for New Year's.  I go to go, I'm going and checking for my flight to fly back, and I walk up, and there's like 600 people in line trying to fly back.  So I'm like, I know what I'll do.  I'll just go out to the Skycap, toss the guy five bucks, and I'll be in and out.  And I show up, and my 10 o'clock flight has been canceled, and the next one out is like, I think it was like three in the afternoon. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, wow.  So I'm sitting there trying to, okay, I'm going to stay, be in a good mood.  So they go, okay, took my bag, gave me a voucher.  I go in there to check with the lady about the voucher.  She goes, well, you want to get on it?  There's another 10 o'clock to go to JFK.  And I'm like, okay, but I just checked my bag out on the curb.  Can I go get that?  And she's like, no, you can't.  It's too late.  You now have to sit here for five hours.  No, that bag is gone, sir.  The stewards looked at me like, what?  You're changing flights as we're closing the door? 
[00:17:00]  And she's like, I can't personally take your baggage off.  You have to go back to the agent in the terminal.  Yeah.  So you said you wish you could read my mind.  Well, here you go.  Here's a communique that was sent to Eric Logan, who I love dearly, who has really made us big stars at XM.  Was this one that was CC'd to everybody?  Everybody.  Everybody.  Did you get this, Bill?  No, because I think you've got to share the fun with every employee. 
[00:17:30]  Well, Travis got this one.  It was sent to Eric Logan.  Lowly Travis got this one.  It was sent to Eric Logan, Anthony, Don Wicklund, Jim Norton, Ben, Steve.  It goes on and on.  And this is exactly what I wrote.  I can't take this shit anymore.  I'm done as far as traveling for XM goes.  Don't even approach me with travel plans for anything.  The unprofessionalism and incompetence is fucking mind-boggling. 
[00:18:00]  Please read the email that was sent by Don below carefully.  It says I'm all set to fly into JFK, where my car is.  Guess what?  I'm flying to fucking LaGuardia.  Meaning after flying all day, I have to take a cab to another airport to get my car.  Airport code for fucking LaGuardia.  F-L-G-A.  F-L-G-A.  I've flown into LaGuardia before.  I hear fucking LaGuardia is really a bitch, though, to get out of.  Meaning after flying all day, I have to take a cab to another airport to get my car.  Also, our seats are not together, which is minor, and I acknowledge that. 
[00:18:30]  But, Don, why would you say they were next to each other when obviously they're not?  So he didn't even check on the flight.  And he'll go to his grave saying he did.  But you didn't because, you know what, they just happened to change the seats?  You see him at 80 years old, laying in a hospital bed.  I did book that flight correctly.  He's going to his grave.  I will never say that.  Rosebud.  You joke? 
[00:19:00]  It's the travel agency's fault.  You joke?  I will haunt him until he either gets it right or quits.  Really?  That's his only options.  But I will be haunting him.  Opie's thumbs are still bruised from typing that text message with all that anger.  Well, my Blackberry's fucked up thanks to the fine folks at Circuit City who are pouring Red Bull and Vodkas all over it.  Oops.  Another story.  We had a fine party in Vegas the last night.  Great guys at Circuit City.  There were a lot of parties going on. 
[00:19:30]  Alcohol.  Yeah, there were all kinds of, like the AVN awards thing was going on, the adult video news thing was going on.  So Jimmy and Keith the Cop are going to these parties.  I'm getting invites to go to these porn parties.  And then someone went and comes back and you hear, it sucked.  It was like a room full of people.  Like it could have been just anyone's dopey party that you walk into and don't know anyone.  Like you expect a porno party.  It's going to be naked girls and dildos and shit like that flying across the room.  No, it's just guys standing around. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, well, you know, video sales were up 3% this year.  We're hoping next quarter is going to be a little bit.  This is a porno party?  Where's the dildo?  Yeah.  Where's the hedgehog doing some ass fucking?  Yeah, where's the double dongs?  All right.  So the seats weren't together.  But Don, why would you say they were when obviously they're not?  This really makes me feel like an important part of the team.  This is just another error on a long list of travel fuck-ups since coming to XM.  Why do I have to personally suffer because people don't like Kenny? 
[00:20:30]  I can't think of anything like this happening when Kenny's involved.  Didn't.  It never happened.  Never.  Well, Kenny was a road manager for 18 years.  Yeah.  But they want to ignore that for some reason.  As far as the trip coming to Vegas,  I would have never made it to the airport with the initial fuck-up  because Kenny would have checked our flights early in the morning of our travel.  No doubt in my mind he would have caught the error.  That's the fucking difference.  I cannot express how pissed off I am right now.  Don, I don't want to hear shit as far as this fuck-up goes.  Do not call me.  Eric, we have a real problem and we need to talk early next week. 
[00:21:00]  Uh-oh.  So, Don, just in case you thought I calmed down the last two days,  absolutely fucking not.  And here's how much I care about Opie  because I stayed in Vegas an extra day.  So, I'm in Vegas.  Were you thinking about him as you were lounging at the pool?  I checked my email from my room.  He has a thought about me in five years.  From my suite.  I checked my email and I saw Opie's email.  Very upset.  Very disturbed. 
[00:21:30]  So, I immediately...  You need one of those mints off your pillow?  Yes.  Yes.  One of the mints.  I immediately fired off an email to Wickland  and said,  How does this affect my flight back?  I want to make sure this doesn't happen to me.  I got to start thinking about me more.  It's all about me.  Well, I'm going to start doing me, me, me.  I am in the me phase of life.  It's so easy to do to me, me, me. 
[00:22:00]  I don't care.  I could give a flying fuck about anyone else.  Now, it's all about me,  how I can be convenienced,  my things,  what I do,  what I have to do,  things like that.  I spent too many years just being yes man.  Yes man to everybody.  All right.  Sure thing.  I'm on it.  Was that like back in like the 30s?  Way back.  Oh, yeah.  In the 30s.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You were in high school.  That was it.  Sure.  Me, Charlie Chaplin. 
[00:22:30]  Albert Einstein.  I was always grabbing him beakers or whatever he needed.  Yeah, who spoke at your graduation?  Who was the guest speaker?  Oh, the guest speaker?  Yeah.  Clark Gable.  Oh, was it?  Yeah.  Came in to talk a little about drama.  Teen heartthrob.  I did.  Teen heartthrob.  Clark Gable.  How could you grow this mustache?  All right.  So, there's the deal.  And now I got some kind of respiratory thing happening,  which is wonderful.  Because you're on the plane.  Because the plane is nothing but a flying Petri dish. 
[00:23:00]  I was going to guess Grover Cleveland.  Grover Cleveland would have been a good one.  That wacky face there.  They tried to get him.  I had a great day in Vegas after all was said and done.  Very hard to catch up on the sleep thing, like you said,  with the long flight and everything.  But once I was in it, Keith the cop even was like, you know,  he kept coming up to my poker chair.  My chair had hauled him and gone, you've got to go to bed.  I get crazy.  It's a good thing that the closest casino is Atlantic City or Mohegan. 
[00:23:30]  It's an effort.  You've really got to get there.  It's not a quick, like, 20-minute drive, you know, to a casino.  Because if it was, I could see me having a problem.  I went, I guess it was Saturday, Friday, Friday, right after the show.  Went up, had something to eat.  Friday night, I was at the hold'em table from, I believe, 
[00:24:00]  probably 8 o'clock at night after dinner.  So I ate.  I did not leave that seat.  An occasional piss.  Same table until 5 in the morning.  From 8 at night until 5 in the morning.  Wow.  That was just day one.  And then Saturday night, it was from, I think,  sometime in the early evening until about 1.30. 
[00:24:30]  But I had to get up at 4 for the flight.  So I left the casino at 1.30.  That's when Keith came up and was like,  I'm going to be picking you guys up at, like, 5.  Jeez, oh.  That's one of those things, just sitting there going,  okay, if I go to bed now, I'll get 6 hours.  Oh.  If I go to bed now, I'll get 4 hours.  You know what?  I'll just stay up.  I'll sleep on the plane.  I was, that's what I said.  I'm looking at my watch every minute, just going,  all right, a little long.  And I'd set a goal for myself and go, all right, dude, by 11. 
[00:25:00]  11 o'clock, I'm back in the room.  And then 11 rolls around, and you're like, I'm kind of on a roll here.  I'm just going to keep playing, 11.30.  Second I start losing.  And, yeah, second I start losing.  I'm not going to drop money here now.  Second I start losing, I'm out.  And you look at your watch, and casino time blows by so fast that, you know,  you look, and another hour goes by.  I know.  So you've got to make a new goal for yourself.  You don't even go to sleep.  You don't even get sleepy.  You're like that chick from the ring. 
[00:25:30]  You're just sitting there, the clocks move.  Actually, there's no clocks there, isn't there?  No.  No clocks, no windows.  Clocks in a casino.  No concept of time whatsoever.  And then you're just sitting there with his hair in his face like that chick who crawls out of the well.  Just, yeah.  Ah.  Ah.  I just sit there.  They want you, they don't want you to know what time it is or anything.  Oh, yeah.  It's all set up.  The temperature, they've worked out the temperature where it's perfect temperature to keep you awake and wanting to stay there. 
[00:26:00]  The colors they pick.  I've seen these casino shows on Discovery and stuff.  The casino was a little cold, actually, didn't you think?  But it's supposed to be.  Just to keep you awake?  If you're a little warm, you get a little drowsy.  They don't want drowsy.  They want you staying awake and gambling.  The color scheme is set up in a way where they've actually done studies where certain color combinations keep you awake and make you want to stay there.  And they're pleasing to the eye.  I saw a show on Vegas and casinos.  You know these fucking bastards also lay the rugs down in a way so if you drop a chip, it's really hard to find it. 
[00:26:30]  If you notice, is that the reason for those?  They have the ugliest carpet.  I saw a show.  They basically have rugs that will blend into the chips.  The color of the carpet will always match the color of the bigger money chips.  Right.  Like if it's a purple, black, green combination on there, there's this purple, black, green carpet. 
[00:27:00]  To make it harder for you to find your chip.  The colors are very intertwined in pattern.  They're not big like squares or anything.  They're very small color combinations of the same color as the chip.  So if you drop a chip, it falls down.  Later on, I guess the cleaning crew is known to have to give these things back.  You're not leaving with it.  They have to give it back?  I would gather they cannot just leave with a casino's chip.  I was wondering why those rugs are just so brutally ugly.  They are brutal like that so that chips will get lost on them. 
[00:27:30]  And I'm sure they probably have people whose job it is to walk around the casino.  Maybe they have another job, but part of it is to look down and look for chips on the floor and just pick them up.  And there's probably millions in revenue per year that they get just in lost chips.  You've got to think people are dropping a lot of chips in that situation.  You've seen some drunks.  You're drunk.  And then Chip Pyle goes flying.  They pick up a few.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's move on to the phones.  Keith in Jersey.  Keith, what's up? 
[00:28:00]  Well, I initially just had one short comment, which was Opie, travel diva.  Travel diva.  Do you guys realize that when somebody screws up like this and Opie comes in all pissed off, it makes for the best goddamn radio.  He's hysterical, but he's pissed.  Well, maybe they do it on purpose.  Thank you, I guess.  Yeah, that's probably it.  They do it on purpose.  I'm going to be listening to this on the replay all goddamn day.  All right.  Thanks there, Keith.  All right.  Speaking of pissed off, Eric found you and I talking about XM Satellite Radio when we were on commercial radio. 
[00:28:30]  This is classic.  This is priceless.  We'll do it after the break.  And it shows the insight that your pals Opie and Anthony have.  Well, we like to say as many times as we can that we're brilliant broadcasters.  Brilliant.  We don't just say that we're brilliant broadcasters.  We prove it to you.  Back it up.  We back it up.  We saw the future before anyone did.  We saw the future of this and saw the threat in it to terrestrial radio. 
[00:29:00]  You're damn right.  I'm just seeing.  Are we going to continue with the casino thing?  No.  Okay.  Well, you want to do it now or you want to take a break?  You know, that ain't my fucking job.  That's right.  You're the point guy.  You said it's about me.  I said it's about me.  I don't do that.  You don't want me to start.  Figure it out.  You don't want me to start doing a me, me, me show, dude.  Trust me.  You sound real cocky, but if you want me to play. 
[00:29:30]  You sound real cocky.  If you want me to play the me, me, me game, trust me.  I thought this was a show.  Trust me.  This is a little Texas hold'em here, huh?  He just raised you.  What do you got to say about that, huh?  He just raised me.  Let me look at my hand.  It's all cute.  Me, me, me.  I'm buying a house.  I'm going to fold.  I got to buy a house.  No drama.  I need this job.  All right.  We'll take a quick break.  You guys have a nice argument?  I thought we were going to play it.  No, we'll take a break.  Fucking take a break. 
[00:30:00]  Trust me.  We'll take a break.  Thanks, Don, for putting me in a great mood today.  I really appreciate it.  You're doing a great job for us.  It's wonderful.  Well, we got some audio from the Tonight Show appearance.  Opie and Anthony.  It's great.  I like to have those guys on radio.  Wow, that's really nice.  Really nice.  Opie and Anthony show on XM Satellite Radio.  It starts with an O&A plug before headlines.  Opie and Anthony show on XM Radio.  Very nice.  Test tested.  Leno approved.  They plugged us like three times last night in the show.  The Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:30:30]  How to show the road.  How to show the road.  It's Opie and.  Fred no more.  Let the killer pieces.  You prepare for war.  It's Opie and.  Settle the score.  Trust me again with the words that you will hear evermore.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program.  Bill Burr sitting in for Jim Norton today.  Mark has a question from Coral Springs. 
[00:31:00]  Mark, what's up?  You guys got the Giants game here today?  The Giants.  Holy shit.  Big Boo.  What do you know what was the answer?  Yeah, the front page of the Post here in New York.  Big Boo instead of Big Blue.  The news day's got Big Blue it.  Get it?  Say Blue it.  Terrible.  Leading up to the game, the papers were reporting this could be their year.  They seem to have all the right pieces in the right positions.  And holy crap, they didn't even show up yesterday.  What was it, 23-0 Panthers? 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Embarrassment.  I used to get his color, his eyesight checked.  Nah, Eli Manning, he's improved greatly since last year.  He's going to be a fine quarterback.  It's just too early.  Guy's only been doing it two seasons so far.  The big choke.  Yeah, he definitely.  He's got Plaxico, Shockey.  He definitely choked yesterday, though.  And then the Pats had a good game.  That's right.  Of course they did.  It's got to be them and Indy.  It's only right. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, you think?  Yeah, it has to be.  That would be a pretty cool game.  If the Patriots go in, and if they actually beat Indy in Indy, that would be my favorite victory.  Ever?  Well, not ever.  It would be up there.  It would be up there.  Might be right up there.  We're talking shit after they beat us in November.  It's like half our team was in a MASH unit.  We avenged the loss.  What, you beat us in November?  You really happy with that?  You beat our B team.  Yeah.  I know.  I hate when people do that to you.  Dude, come on.  Look at my lineup here. 
[00:32:30]  No one was playing.  All right, Mark.  Thank you.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  All right, bro.  It's a very, very busy day.  Very busy day.  A lot of excitement, because Howard's starting his satellite radio career.  Hoo-hoo.  You could just hear the excitement.  Wait, listen.  Wow.  Did I hear?  No, I thought I did.  For a second, I thought I did.  Wow.  No.  Anyway, speaking of satellite radio. 
[00:33:00]  You know what?  Quickly, he may be vindicated a bit in my eyes.  Why?  In such a way, because he goes to satellite, and he starts doing things, and it is annoying  when people do the things you did when you first started in a medium.  When we first came to satellite radio, we saw the freedom and opportunity to do things  and play certain things and react to them in a certain way. 
[00:33:30]  And then to see him go on and hear about things that we did when we first got, I mean, verbatim,  and just things being played and done and said and scenarios being played through that are,  I got to say, exactly like what went on here.  Right.  Everything from how we handled the technical glitches on the air to certain material that  we played eight months ago.  Right down to playing George Carlin.  The George Carlin opener.  We thought that was the only way to start your career on satellite radios to do the, yeah, 
[00:34:00]  Seven Dirty Words.  Seven Dirty Words, which we started, we did when we first came on.  I mean, the Pat O'Brien tapes.  I'm getting reports from the pests.  Well, this is what's amazing, and he's just going to do it to himself.  He's playing the Pat O'Brien sex tapes and saying it's the first time that these tapes  have been heard uncensored.  Yeah, why?  We got press on the fact that we were playing them.  Uncensored, you ask.  And in true ONA style, we drove that shit into the ground. 
[00:34:30]  That's right.  We played it until you didn't want to hear it anymore.  That's right.  But there you go.  He's had a long time to think about what to do on satellite radio, and that's how he  opens up his new career, by playing the Pat O'Brien sex tape.  Yeah, but he had an interesting little take on it.  He played Prince's Let's Get Crazy on top of it.  So, yeah.  Hello?  Yeah.  Hello?  Kind of did that, too.  Hoo-hoo.  Now we're the guys.  Hoo-hoo.  We started that.  We were doing that eight months ago. 
[00:35:00]  Tell them, Derek.  All of serious radio rips me off.  Tie a bandana around Pat O'Brien's car and listen to him curse.  Amazing.  Yeah, like, you know what we just worked on?  What?  Which is just crazy when you hear him that way.  We have all the Pat O'Brien tapes now on Censored.  We've got to save those for Monday.  You know, me and Betsy and a whore.  That's going to be awesome.  Yeah, it was.  That's a whole new thing.  And then I know Dan was putting together all new songs with him. 
[00:35:30]  Right.  Oh, my God.  Putting together all new songs with him.  Yeah.  It's the same shit we did.  You know it's going to be awesome because you heard it.  Yeah, you heard it escalate, you fucking asshole.  You saw the reaction to it.  It was well-received.  We got press on it.  Nice.  Oh, my God.  Can I tell you something?  He should be in jail.  I'll tell you something I missed the whole first time, I guess, with the bleeping.  I never realized he said that he wanted to beat off in her face.  Yeah, because, you know. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, the bleep was so big, you couldn't tell what that was.  That's a very important part of the puzzle, that he wants to beat off on her face.  I mean, that's a major violent act as far as I'm concerned.  It really is.  How many women's faces have you beat off on?  Honestly.  This is a stranger he's talking to.  I've got to hear that again.  Did you say beat off on your face?  It's shocking.  I thought he said cum on your face.  He said beat off?  Yeah.  I think he said beat off.  He definitely says beat off.  What?  He definitely says beat off.  If you want, Howard, we have the individual.  Now, say that again.  He definitely says beat off.  Okay.  I'm just playing with the board.  If you wanted to, you could go to the individual clips, but maybe we save them for another day. 
[00:36:30]  Jesus Christ.  Sounds very familiar, doesn't it?  Wow.  But see, everyone rips him off.  But it's, you know, his first opportunity on satellite radio, he's blatantly doing something  we did very well.  Ain't got press for doing it, by the way.  It was great.  And to have satellite radio available to you to play those tapes uncensored is a blast.  And it was for us when the tapes came out about eight months ago. 
[00:37:00]  A long, long time ago.  A long time ago.  And we did.  And we played the songs over them, because it's funny as shit to do.  And we had the listeners do their own remixes.  The listeners sent in their remixes, and that's when the bit ends, because that's when it gets  really bad, because the listeners, for the most part, stink.  It was one of our best bits since coming to satellite radio.  The PowerPoint, the sex tapes, and the remixes.  God.  So we want to go to that well again.  I got a hold of Steve last night.  And the Emily Stern audio is up on opianthony.com.  Yes, it is.  And the video. 
[00:37:30]  Where she talks about her big Jewish tits.  Yes.  And we're looking for remixes, everybody.  Remixes from the listeners, please.  Yes, we did the first one, and quite frankly.  Now, Opie, wait a minute.  Quite frankly, it's lame, and we know that.  And you guys called us out on the fact that it's lame.  Opie, before you put that in the player there, what did Imus say?  Oh, you wanted to hear Imus?  Yes, because Imus is like the patriarch of this program. 
[00:38:00]  And I think we ought to listen to him when he said, please, maybe we shouldn't goof on  Stern's daughter.  Right.  Well, this is what Imus said.  We couldn't really tackle this bit in Vegas, because we only had two hours.  Two hours in front of a dopey live audience.  But we're going to tackle this bit now, aren't we?  So this is what Imus had to say.  Howard Stern's daughter, Emily, has abruptly been pulled out of an off-Broadway show in  which she appeared stark naked.  Yeah.  And there are some pictures in the post, too. 
[00:38:30]  I'll leave it guys.  And the Daily News.  And the Daily News.  Yes, but it's a wild shot with...  She's playing, actually, Madonna in the show Triad, which is, you know, obviously, it's  about the Kabbalah and the famous follower of Kabbalah, which is Madonna.  And so she appears in these yellow panties and a cone bra.  And in the finale, the rabbi, who's the executive director of the show, tells her that if she  gets naked, the Messiah will come.  And she strips off all of her clothes, and then the rest of her cast also gets nude, and 
[00:39:00]  then they worship her body parts.  Hmm.  And it was panned in the New York Times as dreadful, mind-numbing, and in bad taste.  How great would it be, though, if she ended up on Hopi and Anthony, you know, sticking  cucumbers in her private parts?  I mean, wouldn't the irony be something to behold there, or no?  I mean, is it not something here that's some twist that's sort of a...  Looking for a silver lining, right?  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  Leave the guy's kid alone.  So there's Imus.  Leave the guy's kid alone.  Leave the guy's kid alone. 
[00:39:30]  By the way, we brought this to the attention of the media, the whole Emily Stern thing.  And here's Imus begging us to lay off Howard's daughter.  Yeah.  Here's what I want to say, and I just hope Hopi and Anthony, and, you know, I'm very close  to Hopi.  In fact, I think he may be my son.  Yes.  And I do like him.  I just, I would say to them, just, let's not, let's just lay off the Howard Stern daughter  story.  I think there's some things that, you know...  If they do that, then they're pussies.  Yes.  They have to go after her and him. 
[00:40:00]  I would be very disappointed in them if they were to do that.  I would implore them and beg them here this morning on my program, the Amish Women program,  to just...  Rise above it.  Rise above that.  Sure.  Oh, and A, this is your morning to rise and meltdown.  I hope you do that.  And not to challenge the stripped, naked appearance of Emily Stern in this, what I guess is just  an atrocious off-Broadway show.  Off-off-Broadway.  Some things that ought to be off-limits, and I just said, take the high road, boys. 
[00:40:30]  I just, I've just been poor and begged my friends, Opie and Anthony, and I said I must  go to Opie to try to take the high road, because as Kinky said, there's no mud on the high road.  Hopefully I'll get a report later today on whether, in fact, they took my advice.  Which they, unfortunately, often do not.  With that said, Mr. Imus, we hear you loud and clear.  Yes.  And that's why we're starting this brand new bit on the Opie and Anthony program.  This brand new bit.  Man, if that wasn't good cop, bad cop, where they're both really bad cop. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  Well.  Stop it.  Now, an interesting side note on that.  When that audio came in, didn't our own E-Rock say, guys, I don't get it.  Imus is really saying, you know, pleading that you guys don't goof on Howard's daughter.  Right.  Like, he didn't see through that at all.  He didn't hear the sarcasm in Imus' voice.  Whatever you do, for the love of God. 
[00:41:30]  For the love of God, for all that is holy, please do not talk about Emily badly.  Yeah.  Guys, again, let me reiterate, don't do that.  And E-Rock tells us, you know, Imus is saying not to goof on the situation.  And I was like, wow, really?  That's odd of Imus to say.  Because Imus loves when we bash Stern.  And then you listen to it.  Absolutely loves it.  Yeah.  If you run the tape backwards, I'm sure you hear some sort of evil Imus voice telling you 
[00:42:00]  to do it.  Of course you do.  Make fun of her daughter.  Make fun of a whore.  I don't care.  But E-Rock, oh, guys.  Guys.  E-Rock, you want to defend yourself?  E-Rock.  Face value E-Rock.  You want to try?  That was before I got the audio.  That was based on what everybody was sending in saying, oh, Imus is telling you guys not  to do it.  Then I got the audio for it.  You heard the audio and then told us, obviously, Imus is being sarcastic, right?  Is he blaming the rips in us? 
[00:42:30]  No.  No, you didn't tell us that.  No.  After that, I said, I have the audio.  And that was the last I said.  I have the audio of Imus saying that you shouldn't make fun of Emily Stern.  That's all I said.  Instead of going, wow, the guy really is sarcastic in this.  It's pretty funny.  It's pretty obvious.  It's pretty obvious he wants us to goof on her.  He's going nudge, nudge.  Okay.  All I said was, I have the audio.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  He doesn't get sarcasm. 
[00:43:00]  Wow.  Well, we got Rob on Long Island.  He's got a problem with us.  A faithful listener of the show.  Rob, what's up today?  How you doing, guys?  All right.  I just think that you guys are above that.  But actually, after hearing Imus, I really didn't know.  I mean, he really does want you to.  Howard spent many, many hours during his career making fun of people's kids. 
[00:43:30]  Many, many hours.  Wishing AIDS on some...  Built a career on wishing AIDS on general managers.  Goofing on people's children.  Constantly goofing on people's children.  Calling out people, other radio personalities that are very close to this program and their children.  Brother Weese.  Right.  Brother Weese.  I'll say it.  Brother Weese.  When Howard went into Rochester, New York, just was just killing one of Weese's daughters.  That's his first thing that he did.  Killing Weese's daughters.  And how old was she at the time? 
[00:44:00]  I don't even know.  It wasn't...  I don't want to get too much into it, but basically, Howard just went right after Weese's daughter.  Right after that was the first thing he did.  Because he's such a nice guy.  Not real nice guy.  So go fuck yourself.  And the guy has done nothing but rag on the children of celebrities when they trip up.  When they fuck up.  That's the first thing he does.  And what he does is, and what he's done over the years, and any fan or anybody who's listened  to him would know this, he goofs on the parent and says, what type of parenting are they 
[00:44:30]  doing that this child goes out and does this?  Well, Howie, the same type you did.  The same type that got into that situation at the Jingle Ball a couple of years back.  You might remember that one.  Where we have police reporting that you and your estranged wife at the time were in the  hospital waiting room crying as there was a situation taking place inside. 
[00:45:00]  That bad parenting, if you ask me.  Not being there.  When you're on the air yelling about your clones wanting your acceptance and using your  catchphrase, love me daddy.  All they want to do are these other jocks.  They just want my attention.  They're trying to get my attention.  Love me daddy.  Love me daddy.  Well, you should have maybe taken that love me daddy and turned it toward your children.  So maybe your 22-year-old daughter wouldn't be naked with those luscious, huge Jewish tits 
[00:45:30]  up on that stage talking about her cunt and her ass and her tits up on a stage if daddy  was there for her instead of greedily trying to sign a contract for a few extra bucks.  Maybe if you were there for your children, they wouldn't end up like so many of the children  of the celebrities that you goofed on and built a fucking career on.  And now we're supposed to sit back and not say anything? 
[00:46:00]  Take the high road?  No.  You know something?  We're not above the high road.  No.  We can be just as big as scumbags.  And the Pat O'Brien sex tapes, that bit was so great for us, we gotta do it again and  we'll just use the Emily Stern audio.  Right.  See what the listeners come up with.  Okay.  The dirtier the better, by the way.  The filthier the better.  Here's the unedited audio of Emily Stern in this really, really awful, awful, way off  Broadway play.  It's in Long Island. 
[00:46:30]  It's way off Broadway.  Some Jewish theater group.  What kind of...  Sexual, spiritual, spiritual, sexual, both ending all, sexual, spiritual, all like hell.  The name of God.  My breasts, my white shining legs, my vagina, my ass are all godly.  Breasts in Hebrew, shod.  God in Hebrew, shod die.  Shod die in Hebrew also means my breasts. 
[00:47:00]  God in my tits, my tits inside, God.  My tits are godly.  My tits are godly.  My tits are godly.  Pop.  I'm so happy I'm in the Kabbalah Center.  I've learned so much.  I now meditate on letters T.I.T.  and everybody will immediately notice my tits.  Letters T.I.T.  Come here.  I love the holy name. 
[00:47:30]  Do we have to listen to this whole thing? 
[00:48:00]  Please.  It's like a minute left.  This is why I never go to theater.  Theater.  Theater.  Theater.  It's the theater.  We're going to the theater.  And then horrific.  It's the opposite of deep.  And sleep, when the peace of the beginning is that, makes me at the end is great.  Deep, don't preach. 
[00:48:30]  Sleep, keep.  Papa, don't preach.  I'm in trouble.  Deep, Papa, don't preach.  I've been losing sleep.  But I've made up my mind.  I'm keeping my baby.  I'm gonna keep my baby. 
[00:49:00]  Turn it off.  Sounds like those Wizard of Oz taped you a blanket.  Yeah, the retarded Wizard of Oz.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Why are you spitting on me?  Is it catalytic?  Okay.  Here you go.  First of all, it's absolutely awful acting.  Yeah, I don't care who is in that part.  Yeah, let's just start with saying that.  It's just critique the audio.  Awful.  Horrid.  Horrid.  What do you do with material like that?  I mean, it's just...  Who wrote that shit? 
[00:49:30]  They're trying to make fun of Madonna, I guess?  You could say no, though.  You could say no.  You want to be an actress?  Try another part.  Try another part.  Yeah.  You're Howie's daughter.  I'm sure that you get some offers.  You get some cash, yeah.  Just because you're Howie's daughter.  I guess it's a big ensemble cast, and they each have their different take on the Kabbalah,  and hers is the, you know, latest celebrity craze take on it, and she chooses a Madonna-type  character, and at the end, she rips her clothes off. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  That's good for her.  And there may or may not be naked pictures of Howard's daughter out there.  I haven't seen any of the naked ones yet.  Yeah, I haven't really seen them.  I haven't seen them yet.  I haven't seen them.  That's right.  I haven't seen them.  So, that audio's up on opianthony.com.  We're looking for remixes.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And even, I think, some of our guys are going to try the old remix game.  People love doing the remixes at home.  The filthier, the better.  We made a quick one.  People hate it.  Really?  They hate it, but this is what we came up with fast. 
[00:50:30]  Spiritual, sexual.  You're the end of the rainbow.  My breasts.  My pile of gold.  My white shining leg.  My vagina.  Your daddy's little girl.  My ass are all godly.  You have and move.  God.  In my tits.  A precious gem.  My tits inside, God. 
[00:51:00]  Is what you are.  My tits are godly.  Your mommy's bright.  My tits are god.  And shining star.  Spiritual.  Spiritual.  Sexual.  You're the spirit of Christmas.  The healing notice by tits.  My star on the tree.  T-I-T.  You're the Easter bunny.  Papa, don't preach.  To mommy and me. 
[00:51:30]  I'm in trouble.  You're sugar.  You're spice.  Papa, don't preach.  You're every day.  I've been losing sleep.  And your daddy.  God is my tits.  My tits inside, God.  My tits are godly.  My tits are god.  Yeah, that's right. 
[00:52:00]  That's right.  I've got Allison.  Allison.  She's the best friend I could ever have.  He's going to lose his mind when the remixes start coming in.  This bit had to start somewhere.  Mama.  The bits, you know.  It's off to a slow start, but we'll see what happens as the days go on here.  The Emily Stern Remix Contest starts today. 
[00:52:30]  Love me, daddy.  Love me, daddy.  The audio's up on opianthony.com.  People are suggesting what to do with that.  Well, yeah.  Prime music would be nice.  Uh-huh.  Tell them, Fred.  Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  So there you have that.  How long?  How long before she is in some radio studio with guys throwing bologna at her ass?  Or laser-pointering her thighs.  Tits.  If that isn't a cry, do I have to spell it out? 
[00:53:00]  She seems, uh, yeah.  Is there somebody really thinking maybe this is her just wanting to branch out and be an actress?  Or do I have to fucking sit here and spell out the fact that this girl is trying her damnedest to get back at daddy and get daddy's attention by being naked?  And this is step number one.  And we all know what the final step is.  We all know what the final step is.  Well, the final ultimate step would be, as was suggested, being here on this program. 
[00:53:30]  With cucumbers?  Getting a cucumber up the twat.  That's the goal.  But at a Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner, when she brings home none other than Patrice O'Neal as her new boyfriend to Howie.  Why do you have to go the black route?  Because that would...  Patrice O'Neal is a fine gentleman.  I know that.  And he would make a very nice husband for somebody out there.  But it is known that some white girls, to get back at daddy, bring home black guys.  You want more gangster than Patrice? 
[00:54:00]  Who do you think would be good?  I don't know if it's a black-white thing.  It certainly is.  In a Jewish family?  She seems to just be a wild one.  She just seems to be wild.  You think a little wild?  Yeah.  Absolutely.  I know some people can't pick a script, though.  Yeah.  Some people just aren't good at it.  And somebody maybe ought to read over her scripts and say, no.  I don't think this one's for you.  Like I said, you could say no.  You could say no.  Well, lots of reaction on the phones right now.  Tex in Arkansas. 
[00:54:30]  Tex, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Today is the last day of my job.  I quit.  I stayed home with my daughter for the rest of her life so she doesn't embarrass me.  And she turns out to be a good kid and nothing like Emily Stern.  This is my last day of work.  I'm officially giving notice this morning.  Oh, and Howard was livid.  He made her quit the play and everything.  He was beyond pissed off.  A little spin on that one was that the director promised not to let her name out  and make any tie between her and Howard.  And once that was broken, that confidence was broken, she quit. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah, because the kind of person who would write something like that is so trustworthy.  Yeah, doesn't want to capitalize it.  No, no, not at all.  He's not just trying to get some actress in there naked.  With a little name on.  But I don't think that's the case anyway.  Wow, the article is great.  I only read the Post article when we were in Vegas.  Stern daughter rudely exposed to stage world.  The writer-director of Kabbalah and off-Broadway religious satire in which cast members stripped naked yesterday  blasted female lead Emily Stern as a Jewish-American princess for abruptly quitting the show 
[00:55:30]  and called her famous father, Howard Stern, a psycho.  Israeli-born stage maven Tuvia Tenenbaum, who runs the Jewish Theater of New York,  told me he canceled the run when the 22-year-old actress who played Madonna in the show  bowed out after six weeks at the Triad Theater on West 73rd Street  because a couple of Howard Stern fan sites exposed her celebrity parentage.  We were looking for a talented actress to replace her, this guy says.  But after Stern fan site outed her, Emily was distraught.  She said she was freaked out and had to quit, but I told her she was behaving like a Jap. 
[00:56:00]  Just what she promised me she would not do, said the 48-year-old Tenenbaum,  a former Orthodox rabbi who moved to the United States, blah, blah, blah.  After I cast her in late September, her father called her in for a meeting, Tenenbaum recounted.  She came back very shaken.  She said,  My father basically told me that if I take the role, which requires her to be on stage nude for the last ten minutes,  that his enemies would buy blocks of tickets, throw garbage at my vagina,  take nude pictures of me, and put them all over the Internet. 
[00:56:30]  I told Emily, you have to stand up for yourself as a human being and as an individual.  We have a winner.  And separate from your father.  Your father's a psycho.  Your father is selfish.  Howard Stern's manager, Don Buckwall, refused to discuss the situation.  Of course.  He called me an unprintable name.  He added sarcastically,  You're a noted journalist, and I look forward to reading one of your epic stories.  And it just goes on.  Disowned.  Sounds to me like she's disowned.  Like he put the law down, and she said,  Fuck you.  I'm doing this anyway. 
[00:57:00]  Right.  I'm my own woman.  More quotes from Howard about this.  He told her,  If you're in that show, a lot of people are going to use it against me.  Don't do it.  Don't do it.  Don't do it.  And she did.  This is Tenenbaum again.  And your father's a brilliant entertainer, but he's very selfish towards you.  And I said I would keep it a secret that she was Howard Stern's daughter,  but she had to promise me she wouldn't quit, so we went ahead.  And there you have it.  Well, the audio's up on opianthony.com.  We will do remixes.  And there is video.  And the video's up, too, somewhere? 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  That's up on opianthony.com, I'm assuming.  Yeah, you can check that out.  Get to it.  That's getting lots and lots of hits.  As well as Pat from Menaki.  Cribs is up and running.  Oh, I saw that last night.  It is so tragic.  He is impoverished.  The guy is living in squalor.  They could not describe it over these airwaves as well as this video shows.  It is a shithole.  He lives in an absolute shithole trailer. 
[00:58:00]  We did like an MTV cruise.  That's a tragic story.  Oh.  VH1 behind the music, former eggnog drinking champion.  Right.  Look at what has become of him.  Wasting his fortune.  Yeah, his eggnog drinking fortune.  What did he get for that?  He got residuals and stuff.  Yeah, sure.  When you see some of the things in this trailer,  I think the most tragic parts are where he goes into this,  I guess it's a closet.  I can't tell what part of that trailer is a closet or a bathroom or anything. 
[00:58:30]  It's just like one mess leads into another.  It's like one big dirty closet.  It is.  It's a big, like a storage facility.  Tennis rackets and shit laid around.  It's hard, but there were things like just in the middle of the floor,  and I didn't get the layout.  It wasn't that, what's that Asian way of setting up a house so it's all in sync?  Feng Shui?  Feng Shui.  I wasn't feeling the Feng Shui of his trailer.  His box of trophies was the most depressing part of it. 
[00:59:00]  From his eating competition?  No, from his younger days as a wrestler in high school.  And he has pictures of himself all young and virile, manly.  Not ten toes.  Yeah, ten toes.  Not the freak he is now.  Pictures of him being vile.  Vile.  Going back to last week.  Going back a little self-abuse there.  He kind of goes, here's my box of broken trophies from days gone by.  And he takes the top part, and it's him doing some, you know, 
[00:59:30]  the top of the trophy, some physical activity,  and he's just spinning it around, and it's kind of broken.  Like they've all just been thrown in a box and forgotten,  just like the reality of that.  Some years of being evicted and having to leave.  Yeah, having to move.  How many times has that box been shoved in the back of a shit car?  He doesn't even unpack them anymore.  He knows he's leaving soon.  So it was really tragic.  And the video is now up, Pat from Minaki's Cribs, 
[01:00:00]  and they do it just like MTV's Cribs, which makes it really fun.  Oh, they even steal the whole beginning clip and everything.  Steal the intro of the real Cribs and all that.  I'm going to see this.  It's really good.  It's an old bit we've been doing for a while.  We haven't, well, this is the first one in a few years now.  Yep.  Pat from Minaki, what's up?  How did you like your Cribs on the website there?  Oh, it was spectacular.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Did you watch it, the whole thing?  Yes, I did. 
[01:00:30]  And any favorite parts?  Uh, hmm.  I kind of like my memories falling off my refrigerator and shattering on the floor.  And then the magnets wouldn't even hold it onto the refrigerator.  Yeah, that was pretty funny.  When it just slid off the refrigerator.  Picture him.  He goes, all right, even the magnets won't hold me up.  Like his actual weight is in the picture.  I still haven't seen the video.  I've got to check it out later.  The end is really classic where they, uh, because everyone for some reason has to be 
[01:01:00]  coached as to how the episodes of Cribs end.  On MTV they always end with the camera crew leaving and the person whose crib it is by  the door going, well, goodbye, thank you MTV for stopping by, and then they go back in  the house.  Basically saying it's time to leave, get out of here.  Yeah, and for some reason they never know and always have to be told by the video crew.  So Pat says goodbye and then he's kind of standing there and you hear Than or somebody  say, uh, Danny, I'm not sure who it was, say, um, you're supposed to just wave and  go back into your place and shut the door. 
[01:01:30]  He goes, oh, okay, well, goodbye, thank you.  He shuts the door, you hear something fall.  He opens the door and he goes, oh, my speaker fell over.  And they zoom back in the door and there's this big speaker laying on the floor.  It's just, um, nothing goes right.  That's great.  All right, Pat, we'll all check it out later today.  How's the cat?  Okay, and, and, oh, the cat's fine.  Uh, and everybody, stop donating money.  I do not want money.  Yeah, uh, obviously he's being sarcastic. 
[01:02:00]  No one's donating money.  Um, I've read the message boards where they're saying that, um, me and you are selfish and  greedy because we haven't hooked up Pat or, uh, Stalker Patty, who now owes, like, $2,000  in back rent.  Uh, like...  Do you want us to spend a half hour, uh, telling you guys what we've done for Stalker Patty over  the years?  Um...  It's not even funny at this point.  No, there's no humor in it.  No, but it's unbelievable how much we have given Stalker Patty.  I wouldn't worry about Patty.  But that's not the type of thing we do on this show. 
[01:02:30]  Get...  Pat, he just wants to touch something.  Get him a kayak.  And pick up that cath with leukemia.  Bring him out of that trailer.  Wait, he's, uh...  I want to touch my toe.  Wait, you got $962?  I don't have $962.  On what?  What's that on, Eric?  That's the, uh, the PayPal thing set up.  That's how much it's been donated so far to Pat.  What is that, um, donation thing?  Uh, what are the other names?  Who donated? 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  They list the names of everybody who donated and how much they donated.  And that goes to Pat how?  I refuse.  I guess they cash it out and give him a check from it.  When?  Whenever they decide to end it.  Like, is that just a bank of Pat now?  You can go in and write checks off of that?  There's one for Patty, too.  Patty's up to $325.  And Pat from Menaki's, uh, just under $1,000.  It's a tax deduction, right?  It is a tax deduction.  There you go.  Where can you get to that page?  Right off Opie and Anthony.  Right off Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.com. 
[01:03:30]  The O&A Disaster Relief Fund, it's titled.  Yeah.  And there's one for Stalker Patty and one for Pat from Menaki.  Stalker Patty, is that her sitting on her bed?  What is that?  A Stalker Patty needs $3,400 so she can pay her rent, her back rent.  She got backed up $3,400 in rent.  Uh, the description for Stalker Patty.  One mandible, no future, hungry.  In all seriousness, give as much as you can.  She is due to be evicted this month.  Jesus.  We need to raise $3,400 so she can pay her rent. 
[01:04:00]  Does she have a job?  Does she work?  Yeah.  Yeah, she works pretty hard, actually.  She died for chocolate.  She, uh, she...  Good deal.  I don't think ISM's going to allow her to live here.  No, not like any of those.  The old place.  She lived under the stairs for a while.  Pat from Menaki, nine toes, one trailer, all heart.  Pat, in all seriousness, give as much as you can.  He lives in a shit box.  We also plan to, uh, re, uh, wait.  We also plan to renovate his trailer and give this decent guy a home fit for a human being. 
[01:04:30]  See, here's the problem with that trailer.  You need a human being for that?  What an ass you are.  Ow!  Here's the problem.  I, uh, I dabbled in construction for a while there, Opie.  Actually, I, uh, so from what I saw in videotape, this thing is irreparable.  There is no renovating this trailer.  First of all, it's an actual trailer.  Oh, yeah.  It's a trailer.  Falling apart.  There's no renovating it. 
[01:05:00]  There's no clearing it out, putting new stud work.  The whole framework of this thing is a rusted, decrepit mess.  It should be condemned.  A, a, a drug addict shouldn't be living in this thing.  Since it's technically a vehicle, it'd be called totaled.  His home is totaled.  You know what I like that wasn't really mentioned on the, uh, on the air was the, uh, the duct tape that you have in your bathtub.  From the wall to the bathtub, where there's usually caulking, where nice tile work meet the tub, and there's caulking there. 
[01:05:30]  Uh, it's like drywall.  Just some kind of drywall in the shower.  Well, actually, it's a coated board.  Coated board.  Yeah, it's coated with more mildew than I've ever seen.  That's not mildew.  It was coated, and then underneath it's brown.  It's a brown piece of board.  And from, from cleaning it, don't laugh at that.  I'm laughing.  From cleaning it, their yellow wore off, and you see the brown underneath. 
[01:06:00]  It's not mildew, because mildew has a specific smell, and they do not have mildew.  All right, I wasn't there.  In the stairs or in your lungs?  Yeah, I wasn't there.  I don't know, but I did see the duct tape.  Hey, uh, we got a contractor that wants to help you out, Pat.  Pat, what's your email address for these people?  Because then there's another guy who wants to do Pimp My Trailer with you.  Ooh.  How do they get a hold of you?  Me?  Yeah. 
[01:06:30]  Uh, uh, I guess, uh, MySpace.  MySpace, uh, Pat from Munaki.  Pat from Munaki.  MySpace.  Yeah.  MySpace slash Pat from Munaki.  And you've got to know how to spell Munaki.  M-O-O-N-A-C-H-I-E.  Yeah, it's like Munachi.  Munachi.  Munaki.  Hey, Jacob, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  Hey.  Long time been.  Listen, uh, I'm a general contractor in Central Jersey.  Uh, I do mostly, you know, renovating on really shit, awful houses. 
[01:07:00]  And, uh, I'd love to help Pat out.  I spoke with my guys.  Um, a lot of guys are, you know, willing to help him out.  Yeah.  I'd like to get in touch with Pat.  All right.  Get his address.  Go out there.  Take a look at it.  Hey, when you find the bones of dead hookers, are you going to report it?  Uh, that depends.  You know, if they're all...  That's why I bury them at a different location. 
[01:07:30]  All right, Jacob, you can get a hold of them through MySpace, okay?  All right.  Pat from Munaki at MySpace.  Thank you very much.  Listen to him.  Hopefully we'll get something going for him.  All right.  Uh, Pat?  I just wanted to make clear that I do not want money from O&A fans.  All right, but you'll take it.  No, no, no.  You should take a little of it.  How about some eggnog?  Just take a little of it.  You need it.  All right, Pat.  Actually, you give it to Patty.  I authorize transfer to Patty for her rent.  You need it.  Yeah, you need a little help. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, stop being a martyr.  Your life is fucked up, and you need help.  And the listeners will help you.  Well, I can't argue with that.  They're good that way.  All right, Pat.  We'll all check out Pat from Munaki Cribs up on opianthony.com.  Thanks, Pat.  Thank you.  There he goes.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Okay.  He's like an insecure, like, Curly Howard.  Yeah.  He said, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.  He just kind of, he's just.  Never knew how appropriate that car crash was, though, every time he talks to us.  That trailer, I swear to you, looks like it has been in a wreck.  In some type of highway wreck. 
[01:08:30]  I didn't know anybody, like, in the immediate New York City area lived in a trailer.  He lives right by Teterboro Airport.  So, during the segment, you're constantly hearing jet planes taking off.  Like, he's just.  Every bad thing about a place to live is there, where he is.  Location, the trailer.  He rents a slab.  It's a slab of concrete that you pull your trailer on and hook the water up and the power.  And it's something like $700 a month he pays for this. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  For a hovel.  All right.  Bill Burr sitting in for Jim Norton.  On the way, we'll do the XM thing.  This is really great audio.  Very insightful.  That's why we call ourselves brilliant broadcasters.  We'll do it next.  We saw that satellite radio was going to be a real problem when we were doing commercial radio.  And E-Rock, while we were in Vegas, he dug up some old tape of us just losing our minds  because the station we were on at the time, WNAW in New York,  they were accepting XM commercials that we had to play during our show. 
[01:09:30]  And we just lost our mind.  Absolutely.  Because we saw the future.  It was right there.  And the station was too dumb to see for themselves.  And we couldn't believe that.  So, we got that on the way.  We also, free radio ads by celebrities.  We love this.  Uh-huh.  They're trying to combat, I guess.  Yeah.  Trying to, you know.  Combat.  Combat.  Mm-hmm.  I'm losing it.  I'm getting sicker by the hour.  I'm not even.  Sicker.  Not even kidding.  You're kidding.  I'm losing my mind.  Anyway, we got celebrities doing free radio. 
[01:10:00]  You know, how radio should be free.  Should be free, man.  And these commercials are hilarious because they're just stupid.  Mm-hmm.  They're just stupid and they're not.  They must be getting scared now.  All of a sudden.  Absolutely, they're getting scared.  It was nothing before.  It was just, I think it's a fad.  That'll go away.  You know what that's like?  That's like network TV when cable first came out.  Exactly.  Home box office.  Yeah.  What is that?  And when you read those frigging message boards, the radio message boards, New York radio message 
[01:10:30]  board, they always say, whenever anybody brings up the network TV, cable TV analogy,  as far as the terrestrial radio and satellite radio go, they go, oh, no, that's something  completely different.  No, it isn't.  How?  It's the exact same thing.  It is so exact same thing.  It is not completely different.  Same thing.  Yeah.  People saying that no one's going to pay for it. 
[01:11:00]  It's something you can get for free.  Why are you going to pay?  Why?  Because the quality's better.  You're getting better stuff.  Well, it's great audio.  It's a great look back because we just lose our minds.  And then we talked to our big boss on the radio and he had some dumb things to say at  the time.  Of course he did.  And then we got the listeners.  They started their own anti-free FM ads because we're fighting back.  Yes.  Why not with our listeners?  Yeah, because regular radio is doing these anti-satellite radio ads.  So now our listeners are doing anti-free FM ads.  So very racist. 
[01:11:30]  No, free radio is great, man.  You get to listen to half-hour commercials every hour.  Yeah.  And you have your choice of eight different songs that they're playing that month?  Eight different songs.  Commercials that never end.  Even the last refuge that you had, the news stations.  And I've talked about this in the past, the news stations, where you used to be able to  pop on, get the quick headlines on my drive-in.  I got like a 20-minute drive-in.  Not bad at all.  But during that time, I was able to get every friggin' headline from the day. 
[01:12:00]  Traffic, weather, every bit of info I needed on terrestrial news radio here.  10-10 wins.  Now, it's three or four morbid hospital commercials.  When he got the cancer diagnosis, he went to North Shore Medical Center.  I love the comparative one that they've been doing.  Yeah.  It's like, John had a brain aneurysm.  Peter had a brain aneurysm.  John went to Bob's hospital on the corner of the road. 
[01:12:30]  Bob went to North Shore Medical Center.  Jim is now sitting there, a blubbering, drooling idiot without a...  Bob is biking and enjoying life again.  Bob is back at work.  With the morbid piano music in the background.  I only had to take two sick days.  It's like the Coke and Pepsi wars.  Yeah.  And it used to be once in a while they would do that, but it was mostly news stories.  Now, they pile on these morbid commercials.  I can't even tell you how many times... 
[01:13:00]  One day, we're going to have to sit down and figure this out.  How many times we've almost gotten fired, and then we finally did get fired, right?  Yeah, I remember.  We got fired twice now.  But there are so many times that we almost got fired.  And one was when these cancer ads were being played on our show, and we're trying to do  a comedy show.  And we're like, this is depressing as shit.  It's bringing everyone's mood down.  We're afternoon drive.  Everyone's driving back home.  We got to keep it lively and funny, right?  It was the guy from Staten Island. 
[01:13:30]  Yes.  Staten Island.  Who got in trouble with the whole...  Oh, we got in trouble a few times over a lot of things.  Misrepresentation.  And then the big thing was...  The George Harrison thing.  George Harrison actually went to this hospital that this guy worked for, for this stereotactic  radial surgery.  Tumors of the neck, eyelids, nostrils, and earlobes.  This guy would talk about tumors...  He would talk about tumors you never knew you could get.  Never knew.  You could get a tumor of the back of the...  What?  If you have metastases of the neck, head, chest, ear, if you have cancer of the kneecap, 
[01:14:00]  the calf, the heel, the toenail...  That's a really good impression.  That was the delivery on this spot.  If you have a tumor in your waist...  In your waist, neck, intestine, liver.  It was just this morbid thing.  Ben cracks up.  He knows the guy's name, the story.  He actually, when George Harrison had a huge brain tumor, he didn't even know who the fuck  he was. 
[01:14:30]  This guy brought in a guitar.  To have George sign it.  To have George sign it before he died.  This is the hospital.  This is the friggin' guy that was in charge over there.  And that got him booted out.  But what an ethical fucking asshole this guy is.  So the guy was spending a lot of money on our commercial radio show.  And with this delivery...  The best thing was...  No music behind it.  No bed, right.  There's no bed.  No little piano music.  It was just him going...  I can't remember his name.  Sigh something?  Yeah.  I don't know.  But it was always...  If you have cancer, we have stereotactic radio surgery that pinpoints the tumors and 
[01:15:00]  shrinks them in size.  Most people get results they are looking for in reduction of tumors of the neck, head, chest,  inner ear, thigh, nostril.  Every friggin' part.  And he's just talking about tumors and everything.  Dry delivery just like that.  No backup music.  So we decided, well, the commercial needed backup music.  To see how it would change this guy's morbid delivery, how important music is. 
[01:15:30]  Right.  And how it changes things.  So we decided to put...  Circus music.  First we did the circus music.  Then Benny Hill music.  And it really did change it.  We tried morbid music too and it made it even more morbid and scary.  Yeah.  But then the happier the music, it kind of made it a fun little delivery.  And it was a great bit.  We did it for a half hour, 40 minutes, whatever.  Oh, boy.  Man.  Oh, man.  Had no idea the guy was spending, I don't know, millions of dollars.  Do you understand how many millions are spent by this hospital on a yearly basis and now 
[01:16:00]  they want to pull the ads because of you?  Do you think Mel Carmisen wants to hear that you guys have lost millions of dollars in  revenue?  Because I'd like to have that speech to put some music behind it.  Fun circus music.  And while we're at it, why won't you leave Howard alone?  He's crying big time.  We heard you talk about cabbage and mayonnaise.  Was that a reference to Howard Stern?  We need to know.  Because he's very angry and we know that you...  No, it wasn't.  Because Howard thinks it is.  Shut up.  We need to get back to him and kiss his ass a little more.  And he's freaking out. 
[01:16:30]  All right.  So why don't we take a break?  We'll do the XM satellite radio spots from the old days.  They're really good.  And then we'll get into the free radio ads and the anti-free FM ads.  All right?  Righty, right.  Oh, yeah.  Pat O'Brien.  That's what this break started with?  The Pat O'Brien sex tapes?  Yeah.  Well, we got one of the remixes that we really liked.  The whole let's go crazy.  Mm-hmm.  Seems like it's brand new to someone today, but I don't know.  Eight months old.  I think it was Derek who came up with this like eight months ago. 
[01:17:00]  Check it out.  Saved message Sunday, 7.09 p.m.  Hey, it's me.  I know what's wrong with me.  And why I'm like crazy.  But I want to fucking...  I want to fucking go crazy.  Crazy.  What the hell are you doing?  I'm so fucking into you.  You're so fucking hot.  I want to lift your pussy.  I want to make you cum.  You're such a kiss. 
[01:17:30]  I want to fucking make you fucking crazy.  Crazy.  Look at me and say yes.  They get awake.  Look at me and say yes.  Look at me and say yes.  Look at me and say yes.  I want to make you cum.  Let's go.  I don't want you badly.  You know what you want me?  Let's just fucking have fun.  Get this.  That's it.  Just go out in the bathroom. 
[01:18:00]  Only can't bless you now.  Bye.  Let's go crazy.  Let's get up.  Look at me and say yes.  Look at me and say yes.  I want to suck your pussy.  Fuck dirty.  Get off your face.  I'm going to hire a hundred.  You're so fucking hot.  You're fucking hot. 
[01:18:30]  I'm going to fuck you.  I want to fucking go crazy with you.  So crazy.  I want to fucking go crazy with you.  Do you realize who you hired?  He's a destructive influence.  Anthony.  He happens to be a dwarf.  What horrible people.  Our new bosses said you guys should get as crazy as you want.  They keep creating new ways to celebrate mediocrity.  Opie and Anthony show.  It's psychotic.  It's too many men. 
[01:19:00]  Too many people.  Making too many problems.  And it's not a part of love to go around.  Can't you see this is a land of confusion?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  This is the world we live in.  And these are the hands we're given.  The kids and the lads are trying. 
[01:19:30]  To make it a thing worth living in.  All right.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program.  Bill Burr in studio.  You were going to have a DVD?  We should talk about that because we have stories.  I was going to make a DVD this weekend out at the Punchline.  So the guy in San Francisco will be at the Punchline.  Yeah.  We'll be there this week.  Tuesday through Saturday.  Sorry.  Um, Tuesday through, you're starting tomorrow?  Yeah.  So you're going to be there just the whole week like that? 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  Nice.  That's a little different for you, no?  The whole week?  Uh, yeah.  Well, I mean, I was going to make this fucking DVD and this guy gives me the price.  He says it's going to be three grand a night to shoot.  So I go, ah, you know, it's kind of high.  And he's like, oh, you know, throws out Fillmore and all these bands he's done and all that shit.  So I'm like, all right, you know, I want it to look good.  I don't want it to be some piece of shit, you know, somebody's going to buy.  So, yes, like two days ago, he sends me the email with the final costs.  Uh-huh.  And he goes, sorry it took me so long to get back to you. 
[01:20:30]  I have a big hole in the side of my house.  He's putting an addition on his house, which is the first fucking red flag.  Big red flag.  So then he goes, so it's going to be six grand plus you've got to pay the crew their hourly wage.  You've got to pay their meals.  You have to pay for their parking and you have to pay for the tape and the camera.  So I'm like, dude, that kind of encompasses everything you need for a video shoot.  So what is that first six grand for other than for the addition on your house, you asshole?  Yeah, you've got to pay six grand for the shoot and then you have to pay for everything for the shoot. 
[01:21:00]  Yes, exactly.  Okay.  How much was it going to cost you?  I don't even know at the end of that.  It was so vague.  That sounds very expensive.  Yeah, that's all of a sudden.  It's like, dude, I'm not Scorsese here.  It's a two-camera shoot.  Dude, the parking would cost a fortune.  All you've got to do is set the camera up.  Yeah.  It's not like I'm doing cartwheels and running into the crowd.  It's Mick Jagger on one of those big stages running side to side.  I want some slow close-ups and stuff. 
[01:21:30]  Get a little dramatic with your act.  How many cameras?  Two.  It was going to be a two-camera shoot.  Two cameras.  And I said no crowd shots because I hate when the crowd's laughing.  Here, let me show it to you.  So I was just like, you know, and I was just basic.  This isn't even, it's not even going to be edited.  Then I had to take it after that.  I had to bring it and find someone here to edit it.  You just get the raw tape.  The raw tape, yeah.  Somebody else edits it and they don't do that for free.  And they probably have a hole in the side of their house.  Yeah, something sends me back this real.  I'm sorry if I misrepresented. 
[01:22:00]  Well, the editing will cost $3,000.  But you do have to pay for the editing machine, the editor's time, his car payment for that month.  And the editing.  And the editing.  And the razor blades.  A little old school there.  So did you cancel the DVD?  Yeah, I said, yeah.  You're damn straight, he did.  That's too bad.  I think the world needs a Bill Burr DVD.  I'm thinking maybe now, maybe I'll do it when I'm down in D.C. at the Improv. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  You know, the phones have video now, like video phones.  Oh, is that right?  You get a few fans.  You get like a 20 camera shoot from people in the front row.  You edit all that together every 15 second snippet.  Let me ask you this.  How much is that going to cost me?  Well, you got to buy all the phones.  So it's like a couple of hundred bucks a clip.  No, the initial.  The initial is going to cost you $5,000.  The initial is going to be $5,000.  Plus, you got to, well, the people got to eat when they're at the comedy club.  You got to buy phone chargers.  You got to buy a month of their phone bill. 
[01:23:00]  And then you just get the raw video off of their phone from their websites.  Then you got to download.  So we're going to start with $5,000.  And then I'll bill you in the end.  I'll let you know what it is.  Very expensive.  That should have been a movie right there.  Then you smash cut to the contractor.  Yeah, it's going to be another three weeks.  You want ceiling fans?  Oh, okay.  It just keeps going.  The contractor's daughter's got to go to college just goes back where somehow you're paying 
[01:23:30]  for a probe that's going to Mars in the long run.  Just this chain of events.  You're not lying.  My brother's dealing with that with the restaurant.  Really?  The contractors are just killing us.  It was supposed to be one thing, and now it's another thing.  Always another thing.  Then they're adding this on.  Oh, no.  Oh, that was for just this part of the job.  Oh, and they leave it totally open-ended.  It's like, here's the initial cock-in-your-ass price.  Right.  And then we'll let you know if there'll be any hair pulling or eye gouging afterwards. 
[01:24:00]  Then you have no choice because the job's half done.  Yeah.  And you're like, well, unless you give such-and-such, we can't finish the job.  Yeah.  And you can't fire that guy because then you've got to fire another contractor.  It's like, you're fucked.  Mm-hmm.  Restaurant opening in about a week, though.  About a week.  I want to be at the grand opening.  Yes.  You'll be there.  I want a sample.  You'll be there.  A little restaurant in Huntington, Long Island.  Cuisine.  Called F.H. Riley's.  Right in Huntington?  Right in Huntington, yeah.  I might not be able to go. 
[01:24:30]  How much of a goof would that be?  Hey, this is a new fucking place.  Why don't I come in here and see what the food's fucking like?  Hey, asshole, what the fuck are you doing here?  Hey, here's a bar I haven't been kicked out of yet in Huntington.  Great.  Does it have a bar?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, good.  Not long before her picture's up behind it.  This person is not to be served.  Here's some good news.  I found a bar I haven't been kicked out of yet. 
[01:25:00]  I guess that it's had.  Fucking pictures up in the bars like Dillinger was in the post office.  It's just, do not serve this person.  So, F.H. Riley's in Huntington, yeah.  Stop by and say hi to my brother.  He's working his ass off.  Your fucking brother.  Oh, yeah.  Please.  Have fun.  Please, have fun.  No, I will absolutely be there.  Yeah, I'll have details in the coming days, but getting very close.  All right, we got the XM Satellite Radio ads. 
[01:25:30]  These are great.  This is why we're brilliant broadcasters.  We see the future.  We saw the future many years ago before we fucked up on commercial radio.  I see flying cars in Mylar suits in the next ten years.  Everybody's going to be wearing Mylar suits.  We will have flying cars.  Had we got this right?  Yeah, we certainly did get this right.  We could predict the future now.  So, just to give you the setup.  Pretty soon, Will.  Before we became the pioneers of satellite radio, Anthony and I were doing the old commercial radio thing.  Way back when.  Barely remember what that was like. 
[01:26:00]  We were very successful, syndicated across America in some fine markets, and then we blew it up.  Might have heard of a little town called Boston.  That's right.  Might have heard of a little hamlet of Philadelphia.  Let's not forget Columbus, Ohio.  Can't we, please?  And, of course, New York City, the crossroads of the world.  Perhaps.  How about Vegas?  How about Vegas?  Philly.  D.C.  Dallas.  San Francisco.  Seattle.  How about a chilly little place called Buffalo, New York? 
[01:26:30]  Buffalo and Rochester, New York.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  There you have it.  Just a few of the markets.  That was everyone.  How about New Orleans?  New Orleans, that's right.  Cleveland.  Chicago.  Dallas, Texas.  I said Dallas already.  I like to say Dallas, so I said it again.  All right.  Sacramento, California.  Sacramento.  Anyway, so we're doing quite well, and everybody wanted to advertise on our show.  Even XM Satellite Radio. 
[01:27:00]  They knew.  They knew.  They knew the demo we held, the power we held with it.  They knew who they wanted initially when the satellite started up.  And right off the bat, this goes back easily three years.  Right off the bat, we're like, this is the future of radio.  It's growing by leaps and bounds.  This is definitely competition.  We have to look at it as competition right off the bat.  Seriously, what did you honestly think when you first heard, like, satellite radio, you  can say whatever the hell you want?  Weren't you thinking somewhere, I want to be on that?  Absolutely. 
[01:27:30]  But at the time, first of all, we were in a contract.  Second of all, we were doing really well.  We were doing really well, and satellite radio was still kind of just growing, you know?  They only had, at this point, they only had a few hundred thousand listeners.  Probably, yeah.  Probably less than a million.  Yeah, it had to be less than a million.  I don't even know.  Over three, dude.  We were off for two fucking years.  So this is over three, maybe three and a half, four years ago.  Four years ago.  I'm sure they had under a million listeners and subscribers.  And, you know, to go over there, it was almost, everyone was equating it to, like, E-Yada, 
[01:28:00]  that online radio, where, you know, 50 people at a time could listen, and then it started  clipping.  And people on it were, like, approaching us and going, dude, it's the future.  Is this internet radio?  And I'm like, you know, no, it's not.  No, I can't get my computer on the dashboard, so.  No, it's not.  Can't get it in the car, especially at that point.  Yeah.  You couldn't do that.  But, so, no, it wasn't, we weren't considering it. 
[01:28:30]  Right.  Timing, timing-wise, it worked out perfectly.  What's interesting about this, this goes back, like I said, three to four years ago, and  guys on regular radio today are still denying that satellite radio is going to be anything.  Yep.  Dummies.  A bunch of dummies out there.  So, we did not feel good about taking the XM satellite radio ads as we're doing our commercial  radio show.  We let it be known.  And we let it be known, and they're like, just shut up and play the commercials, right?  And one day, we just, we had it.  We absolutely had it. 
[01:29:00]  So, the commercial's playing for XM satellite radio, and they're, the commercial's saying  how great XM is, and I just turned on the mics and said, fuck this.  Evolution of sound.  100 digital channels of music.  The competition is now advertising on our show, Anthony.  So, whether you're into hip-hop or bebop, news or blues, rock stars or stock cars.  You'll hear more, no more.  This is the competition.  What I'm hooked on right now is a boost of a wide variety of things I've never heard before. 
[01:29:30]  I could drive all the way to New York and never have to change the channel.  It's easy to add XM to A, and it's a car stereo.  Start off the old Beat Anthony show, because satellite radio is here.  This is your local electronic store for a demonstration.  Open whores upstairs.  Learn more at XMRadio.com.  What?  It is absolutely fabulous.  Beyond AM.  This is the competition.  Wake up.  To the power of S.  Price may vary by model and retailer.  Some models require additional installation fees, and tenants and subscription also require.  Douchebag.  What are you doing this New Year's Eve?  Isn't that amazing?  Opie's just yelling like a maniac right over the commercial. 
[01:30:00]  Isn't that amazing, though?  That wasn't a recording, by the way, of the commercial playing, and then Opie off-air ranting about it.  Oh, no, that was on the air.  That is how it aired.  That's how their fine commercial aired.  XM should get their money back for that one.  They did when they signed us, please.  Just letting the Trojan horse come rolling in.  Oh, my God.  Hey, this is a pretty horse for them to leave for us.  Just to put it in perspective, that would be like us running Ezra Howard for the other satellite radio company.  Yeah. 
[01:30:30]  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Taking their money and going, well, it's money, it's revenue, who cares?  It's the competition.  And that's what the party line was over at Infinity, was, hey, they're paying for it.  We'll air their commercials.  They saw it as no threat.  They had no vision that this was going to do anything.  Yeah.  And they just saw it as, hey, take their money.  Oh, so short-sighted.  You've got to be cutthroat.  Cutthroat.  Fuck you.  Right?  It gets...  Advertise on the internet.  It gets better.  So then when we were done with our 15 minutes of commercials, we finally got to go back to our regular show. 
[01:31:00]  And this is how we got back into it.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Oy!  And it's official.  We have a bunch of whores that work for this company.  That's for sure.  Holy S.  We're running a spot on the Opie and Anthony show for Satellite Radio.  Yeah, Satellite Radio.  You know, it's the new...  And no one has a problem with this and this company?  That's called the competition.  Right.  And they're advertising during our show, telling people basically that they have another option out there. 
[01:31:30]  That all over, like, no matter where you drive, you won't lose the signal.  They're talking about all this great stuff that you don't get by listening to the very station that's advertising it.  Who gave the okay to take that?  Bunch of whores.  Hard enough to compete in this day and age in radio.  And now, they're just going to run spots for the competition on our show. 
[01:32:00]  And they have no problem with this whatsoever.  So there you go.  Just so you're not confused, that's us, you know, four years ago about, on regular radio,  just losing our minds because they're running XM spots during our show.  And it was so obvious that people were starting to get excited about Satellite Radio.  It was something that, as we were listening to it, you'd say to yourself,  Wow, that does sound cool. 
[01:32:30]  You get all kinds of formats of music.  You could drive coast to coast and not have to change the station once if you don't want to.  It's not regulated by the FCC.  This is fan-fucking-tastic.  And this proves we're brilliant broadcasters because now, three, four years later, you know, regular radio is in deep trouble.  In deep trouble.  They could have controlled it a little bit if they were smart enough to see what was coming four years ago.  They still advertise, though, right?  They still allow them to advertise?  No. 
[01:33:00]  Finally, they've turned the corner, most of these radio companies, and they will not accept spots for Satellite Radio.  Finally.  Wow.  It continues.  They're making spots against Satellite Radio now.  Now, the same stations that were airing, hey, this Satellite Radio is great, come on over, we'd love to have you, are now going, hey, why pay for radio?  Now, they're all, why pay for fucking radio, man?  You don't want to pay for it.  Well, we got the famous one.  We got like ten of them, but here's the one we really like. 
[01:33:30]  Here's some of the same stations that were running the commercials you just heard.  Right.  Now, this is today what they're doing on regular radio.  In music news, you'll never believe who was arrested on stage last night for performing a lewd act.  It was so outrageous, we can't even describe it on the radio.  You might expect this behavior from heavy metal or rap stars, but this time, the guilty party is none other than the easy listening sensation.  Please deposit 25 cents for the next three minutes. 
[01:34:00]  Radio.  You shouldn't have to pay for it.  This message brought to you by America's 13,000 local radio stations who believe some things were just meant to be free.  A bit hypocritical, isn't it?  Don't.  Pay no attention to those commercials we aired three or four years ago.  We really didn't mean it.  We were just in for the cash.  That's right.  I bought an import from that money.  So outrageous, we can't even tell you on the radio.  Yeah, they're still not getting it right.  But they can on the satellite, by the way.  You know how she was saying it in the old XM commercial right there? 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  So then going back, here's us on commercial radio.  Really pissed off because we have XM commercials on our show.  We discuss it more here.  They bought our show because we have a huge audience, okay?  Yeah.  And the commercial is basically telling everyone that you don't need to listen to Opie and Anthony.  There's other choices out there.  Why don't they just run a commercial with every other show that is on, you know, against us?  Yeah.  And then have the listeners decide, well, I'm going to try out a couple of these shows. 
[01:35:00]  I got an idea.  Here's what he's going to say.  Oh, they're not going to do well.  It's just like that click radio and the E-Yada and all the internet radio thing that failed.  So we'll take a little bit of their money and it'll just fail anyway.  But the thing is, it's not like internet radio.  It's going to be installed in cars and stuff.  Oh, that HBO, it'll never catch on.  That'll never catch on.  That's silly.  People paying for TV, it'll never happen. 
[01:35:30]  If man were meant to fly, he'd have wings.  That is a huge insult, man.  I hope they're getting a lot of money to whore themselves out like that.  Man can't ride on trains.  Don't you know if a human being exceeds 30 miles an hour, he will surely perish.  You know, they used to think that.  That's unbelievable.  Yeah.  It really is.  So there you go.  We're back here on XM.  That's pretty impressive. 
[01:36:00]  Kind of taking a look at the old days, four years ago, when they accepted XM spots on  our very successful commercial radio show.  We saw.  We had the vision.  We knew that this was going to be successful.  We always have the vision.  You know where the next step is.  We're brilliant broadcasters.  People just don't realize that yet.  And that's our frustration every day.  Finally, I had it.  You're going to hear a curse.  And you're listening to satellite radio, so like, whatever, a curse.  Just remember, going back about three or four years, this is on commercial radio, but I 
[01:36:30]  was just losing my mind.  I just couldn't understand why they would do this to us.  Radio's really the best part.  Yeah, I got to stop the tape.  The best part, there's good old Ben Sparks in the background laughing like an idiot.  Years ago, cackling Ben included.  Just in case you thought this was the new Ben on XM, no, he's been laughing like an idiot  for many years for us.  Many years.  Radio's really, it's really getting pathetic.  It's ridiculous.  This used to be a business where every radio station was for themselves, and they just fought, 
[01:37:00]  literally fought on the street.  We used to get in fights because someone else's van was parked outside the venue for a concert.  Now all the stations are owned by the same person or the same company, and they don't  want you talking bad about this station or that station because you're going to hurt  the company.  It's making radio so bland and boring.  And now on top of that, they don't mind taking advertising dollars from the competition.  Right.  They see no problem with this. 
[01:37:30]  Holy shit!  They don't see a problem with this?  Will there be cursing over this satellite radio?  Because I want to gig over there.  I'm sure.  I'm sure.  I want to gig over there.  You know, it's not regulated.  And here we are back on XM.  Look at that.  I want to gig over there.  Cursing on asking, you shall receive.  Should hand that tape into the FCC.  We got away with one back then.  Whoa.  Someone is requesting, let me go to Pete. 
[01:38:00]  I haven't heard this stuff in a long time.  Pete in Rhode Island.  Pete?  Yes.  Hey.  Yeah, I was wondering if you guys could play the clip where you get your bigger boss on  the phone and he's like, oh, don't worry about XM.  No, they're nothing.  They're nothing.  Oh, Ken Stevens.  I think that's the next clip we got here.  Oh, excellent.  All right.  Thank you, Pete.  Thanks.  I don't remember how this went down.  But then we just would not go on with our show.  We were obsessed with this whole playing XM commercials on our commercial radio show.  And finally, you know, we got Ken Stevens, our general manager, on the phone. 
[01:38:30]  What a set of balls when you have the ratings that we had.  Oh, I know.  Over there.  Because you could just do anything except have a couple fucking church.  But besides that, I mean anything.  Right.  We're cursing.  Yeah.  I don't think we got in trouble for that.  So we got Ken Stevens.  He was the guy running the station at the time.  He was one of our really good friends over there.  Yeah, we like Ken.  That's stuck up for us on many occasions with that whole stupid Howard battle. 
[01:39:00]  But here's Ken explaining the XM ads to us.  So the question is, somebody said to me, you're wondering why we're taking these XM satellite ads?  Very good.  You actually understood the question also, Ken Stevens.  Yes.  Why are we advertising for satellite radio an option to listening to this very program?  Pretend for a minute that you don't know anything about the radio business.  And you're just the average guy listening in your car to those XM radio spots. 
[01:39:30]  Okay.  Do they make any sense to you?  Hold on.  Let me put myself in there.  You asked us for a lot and you're not giving us time.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Okay, I'm sitting.  Opie, sit.  So you're saying advertising doesn't work and no one should advertise on radio.  Maybe it's your show.  No.  Holy shit.  He's also basically talking down to the listeners.  Right.  They're a bunch of morons. 
[01:40:00]  They don't understand words like satellite.  It's something up in space.  And they don't know that.  You've got to be a rocket scientist to know about satellites.  Jesus Christ.  Meanwhile, the ad completely explains it.  Completely.  And they have everyday Joes going, I can get in my car and drive all the way across the country.  They gave me the ABCs of satellite radio.  You want to hear any format you want from coast to coast without changing the dial?  Satellite radio.  All right.  You've got to slow that down, man. 
[01:40:30]  Wait, wait, wait.  I'm just the average everyday guy.  I can't take in words that quick.  I didn't understand what you meant by format of music.  Fuck.  I should have taped the show.  Then I could rewind it.  Oh, is that a poor, poor argument to you?  I nailed him so bad.  Yeah.  Advertising doesn't work.  Advertising doesn't work.  Oh, no.  No.  It's just fine.  Keep it coming.  Going back to the tape.  I know I'm saying this a million times, but there are dummies out there.  This is us on commercial radio discussing why are we playing XM commercials. 
[01:41:00]  It's your show.  No.  I think that if you listen to the commercials the way we're running them, they're not awfully attractive.  Did you hear the one line?  How many of your friends are going to go out and spend whatever, what does it say?  On, on, on.  Now, insert color TV here.  Insert radio here.  Insert car here where he's going to say, are going to buy this right now?  I don't know.  Insert Xbox instead of PlayStation.  Right.  Insert any new technology.  Ken, did you hear the one part in that commercial where he says, boy, I could drive through New York and I don't have to change the station? 
[01:41:30]  No, I heard the one where he said, and my favorite is the Blues Channel.  Right.  I'm not really worried about losing a whole lot of audience to the Blues Channel.  Well, not, Ken.  Wow, you guys.  When those radio's come out and they're down, who will be getting yelled at?  Hey, you know what?  If your ratings are down and your audience has moved over to satellite radio, I'll stop taking those commercials. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah, but it's a little here, a little there.  It adds up after a while.  Absolutely.  Wow.  Here on XM.  I don't think I've ever seen you guys so 100% in the right.  Isn't it so cool?  It is almost like me and Opie went into a DeLorean.  We reached 88 miles an hour, went to the future, came back and just shoved it in Ken's face.  We have seen it.  And you know how many people did come over?  Everything he said, like, well, you know, little by little.  Little by little.  It adds up. 
[01:42:30]  The programming.  Oh, it's the Blues Channel.  Yeah, well, some people want to hear that.  Plus, what I also love is you guys would get in trouble for shitting on the people who advertise,  and that's exactly what he's doing here, going, hey, if you listen to those ads, those ads stink.  They don't even make sense.  They don't even make sense.  I didn't understand a word.  Bill, it's called.  And their product stinks.  I wouldn't listen to the Blues Channel.  I don't think we're going to.  If your ratings go down because of satellite, I'll stop taking the ads.  Bill, it's called chipping away.  Chipping away.  Tink, tink, tink, tink, tink. 
[01:43:00]  We're big fans of chipping away.  Chip, chip, chip, chip.  You know, he had to take the call from the guy who was paying for the ads for XM right after that.  Then he'd go, okay, wait a second.  I want you to just imagine that you don't know anything about advertising.  Yeah.  He's always wanting us to imagine something.  Yeah.  Picture, if you will.  Right, right.  A world in which.  Right.  People who speak English do not understand it.  We love the chipping away concept.  We've been chipping away at Howard's credibility for years and his hypocrisy. 
[01:43:30]  Satellite radio.  It's not going to go anywhere.  They barely got up that Sputnik thing.  Right.  You think they're going to be able to get a satellite up there that plays music?  It continues.  We ended up giving these guys like a 20 to 30 minute commercial that day.  And we helped them out.  You're going to leave cars at the airport and rent them and people are going to.  That'll never fly.  People want to have the comfort of their own vehicle.  Right.  They'll have a relative who could pick them up.  Craziness.  I'm not going to want that.  Why would people want a turbine jet engine when the propeller is perfectly fine on these aircraft? 
[01:44:00]  Get cross country in a day.  They're too noisy and people are not going to like them.  Why would you want it?  The propeller gives people a comfort factor.  They see it spinning and know they're being propelled.  Who would want to go to the bathroom in their own house?  When a perfectly good outhouse is right outside keeping the stink and stench out of doors.  Fertilizing your backyard.  Why would you want a direct flight to Vegas when you could go all the way to LA and then go to Vegas after having one of your tickets canceled?  People like seeing different cities. 
[01:44:30]  Even ones that they don't want to go to.  Why would you want to fly into the airport that has your car?  That's just plain stupid.  That is ridiculous.  When you could fly to another airport and then drive from that airport to the airport where your car is at.  I want you to imagine for a second you know nothing about travel.  Right.  Imagine you're sitting on a plane that's going where you don't want to go.  That's right.  And you're just excited.  Imagine you were there.  That's why, Don, I'm so tough because I'm sick of working with dummies. 
[01:45:00]  Wow.  That's why.  Jiminy Cricket.  You went for big air on that one.  Dummies.  Lots of foul language dummies.  We're proving that we're brilliant broadcasters right here and now.  We have the vision.  We can see into the future.  Just trust us.  That was pretty damn impressive.  I got to give you that.  That was very like, wow.  We got more.  Because then there's a question here.  Could ONA go to satellite?  Oh, Jesus. 
[01:45:30]  So going back in time, we're doing our commercial radio show discussing why they're playing XM commercials  on our show.  And do you know that it's going to be an option on all new model cars?  Let me ask you something.  By the way, we also did our research.  Right.  We study this fucking business.  We know our enemies.  We pay attention.  So when someone is saying, well, you're going to be running XM commercials, we're not going  to sit there like every other dumb jock in America and go, oh, okay, okay.  We actually did our research and found out as much info as possible. 
[01:46:00]  And Anthony is like, you know, this whole going to be an option in new cars.  That's what frightened me the most is I could see something if you have, if you had to take  all kinds of wires and gadgets and gizmos that it was never really going to take off anywhere  past just the geek or tech guy or something like that.  But when I heard that these things were going to be factory installed with your AM, FM radio,  satellite radio available right there, just like AM and FM, I was like, oh, boy, now there's 
[01:46:30]  trouble.  But I love the bravado of this.  He starts every, like, answer with, like, this little John Wayne.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that was how Ken operated.  Let me tell you something.  We love him.  And Ken wasn't just any general manager.  He was one of the bigwigs.  Yep.  He was one of the most powerful general managers in Infinity Broadcasting.  Here we go again.  And do you know that it's going to be an option on all new model cars?  Let me ask you something.  Yeah.  You got that newfangled cable or satellite in your house? 
[01:47:00]  You need money this bad, Ken.  With all those music channels on there?  You want us to give some of the money back?  Yeah, I got it.  Including the Blues Channel?  I think it's great, as a matter of fact.  And if you look at broadcast TV, the rating's down pretty low because of cable.  Answer my question.  Yeah, I do.  So when you're sort of walking around the house, instead of turning on the radio, you  turn on channel 956 and listen to the Blues Channel or the Kids Channel?  I believe there's enough people that do it that chip away. 
[01:47:30]  There's my TV and there's my radio, though.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  And I'm not watching TV in my car.  Why assume all this, Ken?  Do we need the money that bad?  Yeah.  Hey, we're in the...  Why don't we just list all the shows that are on opposite us?  Because that's what you just did.  You're killing us.  You know, I took out the one where XM wanted to run the spot that said you were boring.  I didn't run that one.  Really?  Yeah.  No, I stuck to the one that said Blues Channel.  The company has no problem with this? 
[01:48:00]  I guess not.  Must have been a big buy.  They must have been here.  It wasn't a disarray.  Well, they probably will now that you've made an issue out of it.  Uh-oh.  It was supposed to be under the radar.  Oh, yeah.  Because our listeners are stupid.  And this thing is something that Ken has dubbed newfangled.  Newfangled.  So I don't think it'll take off.  I don't think you guys were paying attention, but that's okay.  Oh, God.  All right, Ken.  Well, thank you.  That wasn't what I said. 
[01:48:30]  Thank you for clearing that up for us.  I mean, if you're really certain that you're losing listeners to that Blues Channel on Satellite Radio,  I'll stop taking the commercials.  That's all he had was that reference.  He just didn't.  The Blues Channel.  He did not see the freight train barreling down, man.  Do you think he's just holding the company line, or he really believed that?  I don't know.  I think he really believed it.  I think they all believed it.  I think they all did.  All the heads, you know.  And this went right up to Mel Karmazin, who had the same ideology, 
[01:49:00]  who was, you know, no ad for a competing form of entertainment would be taken  if the word wasn't handed down by Mel.  So he didn't see it either.  And now he's the head of the Doggy Company.  So he obviously changed his tune.  Exactly.  Well, we have one more clip here.  It's quick.  Going back again.  This is like four years ago.  There was a day when sales didn't control radio, Anthony. 
[01:49:30]  It now controls it.  I remember a time that they would fight with the competition.  But now they welcome the business of the competition on their airwaves.  Let's see.  Hundreds of distortion-free channels that travel with you,  being offered in high-end cars driven by decision makers.  Ken's right.  It'll never catch on.  You know, guys, I'll be doing a gig tonight.  But, you know, I don't want to talk about it.  Let's plug Rich Voss.  I wonder if, at some point, they'll make deals with people like us to carry our show. 
[01:50:00]  If people want that as an alternative, no matter where they drive.  But then it says, okay, what about if you're driving through an area that we're on at a regular radio station,  and you can get it on satellite, where's the revenue coming from?  It just throws a whole bunch of things.  Following the logic of this, I'm just assuming that this great company of ours is buying satellite radio.  Well, you know, so they're jumping the gun.  It makes sense.  But you know what?  Get it up there and then buy it. 
[01:50:30]  They're probably not buying satellite radio.  No?  But instead, they're running ads for the competition.  And no one sees anything wrong with that.  Joe, what's going on?  Yo, guys, what's happening?  Hey.  Hey, listen, I just wanted to know, can you repeat everything you said?  I lost the signal, man.  That's classic, you dick.  Very good.  And there you have it.  We're back live here on XF.  Isn't that just amazing?  Visionaries.  Visionaries, yes.  Yes.  We just don't say we're brilliant broadcasters. 
[01:51:00]  We show it to you.  If that was like a made-for-TV movie, I'd be like, ah, that's, you know, one person.  So far-fetched.  Yeah, like, no one's ever that wrong.  Like, whenever they do the made-for-TV movies, it's always like, let me tell you something,  Terry Bradshaw, you're never going to be a quarterback.  And you certainly will not win any championships.  And then you're like, no one ever fucking said that.  That is just over-dramatizing of this to sell this show. 
[01:51:30]  And that's literally what went down.  Exactly what happened.  Ken Swaggering.  Don't you worry about that, boys.  The Blues Channel.  The Blues, oh, yeah.  Well, let me tell you something.  When you go home, and he's trying to relate the two things, being at home and those upper  channels where the music channels are.  Yeah.  You know, you hit there, you get to listen to 70s, 80s, all kinds of music on your TV or  your radio.  It is different. 
[01:52:00]  I don't listen to those channels on my television, but I have a radio at home and I listen to  satellite radio.  Yeah.  I listen to those channels on the TV now.  I've done that.  Is that because people are starting to chip away at that, too, and realize, oh, wow,  I've just got to go up here and I can get all these music channels?  But I have XM right there in my living room.  Right.  Well, and if you've got the direct TV, you've got the XM channels right there.  Yeah.  So, on your TV.  Oh, boy, was Ken so wrong.  And a lot of people.  I see nothing with the Sex for Sam thing.  Guys, you go right ahead with it.  Three years running. 
[01:52:30]  Maybe we should have had someone else in charge.  A lot of people want to know where Ken Stevens is today.  He's on a boat.  He's sailing the Chesapeake Bay.  He just sails.  Day in and day out.  That's it.  That's what he does now.  He's enjoying his retirement.  His early retirement.  A golden umbrella.  His early retirement that we gave him on a gold platter.  And now he's got a golden parachute.  Time to cash in the stock option.  Yep.  Time to go sailing.  Whoops. 
[01:53:00]  What do you think he's investing his money in?  Satellite radio.  I would guarantee he's got shares of one company or the other.  There is satellite radio.  I would guarantee every single radio executive has shares of either XM or Sirius or both.  Every single one of them.  They bash it.  They don't believe in it.  They make ads saying don't listen to it.  Don't buy it.  It should be free. 
[01:53:30]  And they buy, buy, buy the stock.  And I believe most of them are listening to satellite radio too.  Yeah.  Secretly faxing their resumes over.  Oh, of course.  Under assumed names.  You know they make good blind boxes, they're called.  They make good salaries, these guys.  So they probably have newer vehicles where their factory installs of satellite radio.  Do you honestly believe they are trolling through all of those fucking commercials that they can't stand?  Or they're listening to satellite and listening to the music they want to hear or the talk they want to hear? 
[01:54:00]  Mm-hmm.  They're such hypocrites.  So fast forward to the present.  Now we got a hold of some of the free radio ads by celebrities.  Now they're getting the celebrities on board.  At first it was just monotone guys saying be free.  Well, just to follow.  At first they accepted all the satellite radio ads.  And now satellite radio has become something.  Now they're like, oh, fuck.  We got to make anti-satellite radio ads.  Dummies.  It really is funny when you look at the whole big picture here.  They could have taken out a couple steps there, you know. 
[01:54:30]  Just ignore.  The key is to just ignore it.  That's what they should have done is just completely ignore satellite radio.  Yes.  But they actually helped this business grow.  They certainly did.  Thank you.  They probably sped it along.  Who knows?  Maybe six to eight months.  You know?  It probably grew that much faster because of what commercial radio was doing.  It's just like being on stage at like Caroline's and then behind you they have a banner for  some other club right down the street.  Another club that's convenient.  Right?  They're better.  Yeah.  Where the comedians are uncensored. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.  And you can go see whatever comedian you want to hear.  Right.  Yeah.  You just walk in.  And in between my act it would just stop and there would just be, I don't know, some  sort of intermission.  Yeah.  It's like saying the waitresses are hotter, showing more cleavage.  There's more booze in your drinks.  If you're lucky, you'll get two for one, you know?  All right.  Here's Bon Jovi talking about free radio.  Before we sold a million faces and rocked them all.  Before we could sell out Giant Stadium, Moscow's Lennon Stadium, or London's Wembley Stadium. 
[01:55:30]  Before we could close down Times Square just to play for a half a million people.  Before my band became a household name.  Before we sold more than a hundred million albums.  You heard Bon Jovi on the radio.  That's the thing I hang on to.  That gets me tired.  Radio.  You hear it here first.  That's because when they made it, there was no satellite radio, you fucking idiot.  Is that a good thing?  I don't know what that means. 
[01:56:00]  It doesn't mean anything.  I don't know what that means.  They're just so stupid in commercial radio.  What does that mean?  Before we discovered a gold rush in California, we rode a Conestoga wagon across the country.  Yeah.  And there's planes now.  What are they trying to accomplish with these ads?  What does it mean?  They're making it seem like Bon Jovi had the option.  Do you want to be on free radio?  Or satellite radio didn't exist during the slippery when wet days of 1986, maybe? 
[01:56:30]  And here, just because, you know, everywhere you look, there's hypocrisy.  Derek hit it.  Hi, this is Jon Bon Jovi, and I'm proud to be one of the five million subscribers to the XM Nation.  Wait a minute.  Come on, Jon.  What is it?  Make a stand, man.  Jon.  We love Jon Bon Jovi.  Make a stand.  What is it? 
[01:57:00]  Jon.  What is it, man?  That is, he is completely on both ends of the spectrum on that one.  You have to be.  And I'm proud.  But you know what you have to be as the artist?  Anything.  Wherever they're playing your shit, man.  Right.  Wherever they're playing your shit, you've got to smooch that ass.  I've never gotten involved in feuds between different comedy clubs.  Like, if you play this club, you play that.  No.  Yeah.  Right.  That's your fight.  Yeah.  Just lick it. 
[01:57:30]  Lick the ass.  There's the XM ass and the free radio ass.  Lick them both.  You know, we love going off on tangents here.  So Howard's on Larry King talking about hypocrisy.  Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.  And he has this to say about Bubba.  Bubba the love sponge.  I'm really not interested in radio.  Although, what's interesting now that I have these channels, I have to listen to talent  around the country because we're going to bring some people in.  There's a guy starting on my channel called Bubba the love sponge.  He was thrown off of clear channel. 
[01:58:00]  Because he was thrown off of clear channel, I first became attracted to the idea of hiring  him.  And he's got a funny show, a very different sensibility than mine.  He's got more of a redneck kind of show.  And those guys get down and dirty.  All right.  That was Howard about a week ago, right?  Or a few days ago?  This is Howard talking about Bubba less than a year ago.  Less than a year.  Why don't they have an award for most jealous and give it to those two guys?  Bubba sponge and the other guys.  Too many candidates.  Moby the sponge.  Moby Dick.  Moby Dick.  Moby Dick. 
[01:58:30]  Well, the crowd started booing now.  They should just name themselves Howard Stern.  They should.  Why do they come up with that?  And the only thing that they do on their own is give themselves a name.  And it's always a bad name.  It's always a bad name.  It's Bubba the love sponge.  You know, I don't want to be in an industry with a Bubba the love sponge.  Oops.  I don't want to go to an award show with a Bubba the love sponge.  I don't want to be in the same room with Bubba the love sponge.  He's not just wonderful.  But what happened to he's a different guy with different sensibilities and you found him  and then we're attracted to him because of what, you know, I'm leaving. 
[01:59:00]  Completely different than me.  You guys are killing people today.  I'm leaving the fucking business.  We are slaying today.  Yeah, we're slaying.  I could give a fuck if everyone turned this off today.  I am enjoying the shit out of listening to this hypocrisy.  It's one thing just to say he's a hypocrite or someone's a hypocrite.  When you have fucking audio of somebody actually doing it.  Oh my God.  Dude, that is so...  There is no way to explain that away.  You can't say, well, what I meant, what...  There's no way to explain away the fact that you kissed Bubba's ass, said he's different 
[01:59:30]  from you, and he's funny, puts on a funny, different, entertaining show, and then you  were just saying, he sucks, he's a clone, he...  Chip, chip, chip.  See, Phil?  Holy shit.  See the chip, chip game?  Right in front of your eyes.  We just did a little chip, chip, chip.  I'm actually trying to roll back some of the audio I've had on this program.  Chip, chip, chip.  Wow.  Oh, we'll get it if you come up looking like a hypocrite.  Fuck yeah.  We're all about exploiting this shit. 
[02:00:00]  Isn't that amazing?  Wow.  Also, uh...  Also this.  Actually, what I just said there will be part of the clip someday when you get it.  Of course it will.  I'm waiting for the audio.  Here it is, Bill.  Yeah, we have it.  Now that you're on the fuck-o list, Ray.  Here it is, fuck-o Burr.  Yeah.  It's September 06.  I got about nine months before that happens.  Something will happen.  Big story today in the newspaper.  I opened up the pages, and there was my beautiful daughter in the newspaper. 
[02:00:30]  My daughter, Emily, is my oldest daughter.  She's 22 years old, and she's a great kid.  And she, you know, went and did a show.  I was unaware of the show.  I'm not a...  I'm not...  I haven't seen the show.  Don't know too much about the show.  I was unaware because you're an absentee parent.  Love me, Daddy.  Love me, Daddy.  I'm not aware that your daughter was on stage showing her tits.  That's a great father.  I believe he's just downplaying vag, dude.  I couldn't take a leak without my parents knowing about it. 
[02:01:00]  Don't know too much about the show.  And, you know, evidently, she had some falling out with the director.  And it's, you know, it's all rather unfortunate because she's a, you know, she's a great kid.  And like so many people trying to get started in acting, from what she tells me, she put  her faith in the director and the cast, and a wonderful cast, but kind of made a deal  with the director that he wouldn't use her picture for promotional purposes and wouldn't  single her out. 
[02:01:30]  They kind of had a verbal agreement.  And she felt very betrayed by this guy.  That's bullshit.  Like it wasn't going to get out that Howard's daughter was getting naked in a dumb play.  The audio's up on openanthony.com and we're looking for your remixes.  We talked about that earlier in the program.  Yeah.  All right.  By the way, we might have to beat some people up around here.  Paul in Cleveland.  Paul, what's up?  What's up, fellas?  Hey.  Happy birthday, Billy.  I was part of the PR firm that put together those Jon Bon Jovi spots. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  Which ones?  The one about radio.  The one about radio.  And that was kind of more like an anti-MP3 player, you know, listen to the radio, not  your iPod sort of thing.  Not anti-satellite.  I don't see that, sir.  I see any of these pro radio things are anti-satellite.  I didn't say it was good.  I just said that was the aim.  Don't listen to your record player when you can listen to the radio.  Right.  Why would you waste time doing that?  Yeah. 
[02:02:30]  All right.  Well, let's listen to another one.  It's the Rolling Stones here.  Come on.  Before we played stadiums.  Before a little T&A.  Before we had drug busts.  Before all the guitar needed was five strings, two fingers, and one a**hole to play it.  And it's a lovely thing.  You heard us.  The Rolling Stones on the radio.  I guess I don't really know what they're for. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  What are they for?  I think they're for illegal downloading.  I don't know.  They're advertising radio?  Yeah.  They're advertising radio on the radio.  All right.  So they're advertising radio.  They want your business.  They want you to listen to the...  It's a commercial break.  So it's pretty much anti-satellite radio, anti-iPods, anti-MP3. 
[02:03:30]  Anti-anything.  Illegal downloading.  It's probably...  Computer.  They're losing so much business to everything.  I think that's what they're trying to...  Oh, no, they're not.  Ask any one of them.  Nothing has taken away listenership.  All these forms of entertainment that have come about where you can download,  songs on your toaster now.  And that's not taken away from any.  But, Anthony, they have such a great formula.  There's nothing I love more than listen to the 20 minutes, 30 minutes of commercials,  and then hear a song that I just heard 40 minutes ago. 
[02:04:00]  Me, too.  And if it could be something of the pop genre.  Me, too.  And that's why I stick with it.  I could hear Eric Clapton's Layla one more time.  You know something?  You never get tired of it.  It just keeps getting better.  Oh, I'm sure Eric...  Oh, again.  Clapton shuts it off.  No, he does.  That's a great point.  He probably said, for the love of God.  Enough already.  This fucking song again. 
[02:04:30]  So boring.  This is a great...  Bloody boy, I hated it when I fucking did it.  Good phone call from Kevin.  Kevin in Ohio.  What's up?  Hey, what you guys are going through with this, every industry goes through this exact  same thing.  I mean, every industry, when somebody new comes in, they ignore them, or like you said,  sometimes they'll even help them.  And then when they become big, then they start bashing them, and they start thinking, holy  shit, now we're in trouble.  Now what do we do?  There's so many examples of it. 
[02:05:00]  This is textbook, huh?  Oh, it's so classic.  I mean, what I do is I work in construction, and 50 years ago, there was no such thing  as asphalt paper.  I bet you when that first Starbucks shop went up, little local coffee guy's like, ah, come  on.  Nothing but coffee.  Coffee stuff.  I got my regulars.  They're not going to pay attention to that.  Who's going to pay four bucks for a cup of joe?  Right.  Yeah.  You know, that old shipping away thing.  Ah, screw them.  Dude.  All right.  Dude, that guy's in construction. 
[02:05:30]  Uh, new technologies in that.  We used to have to nail up every board, uh, every, uh, drywall board with a hammer and  a nail, and now you just, beep, beep, beep, beep.  Who's the guy that's going, ah, that'll never take, I'd rather, I'm going to die swinging  this hammer.  It's, every industry has new technology, and unless you pay attention, you're done.  I remember when I came home one time, I had bought a new luggage that actually had wheels  on it, and at that point, it was very few of me, and most of them were stewardesses. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  So, both my roommates were trashing me.  Going, a real man carries his fucking bag.  And I'm like, really?  I was talking about that in the airport sitting there, thinking, you know, years ago, people  fucking held these things, and carried these huge things along.  Running from terminal, trying to catch your connecting body.  And it was everybody.  I go, look around.  Everyone is rolling their friggin' carry-on, and they roll their bags when they check them 
[02:06:30]  in.  I go, but just years ago, man, people carried these big, hard-shelled fucking suitcase handles,  heavy fucking thing.  And now, everyone's rolling.  Remember, you see people, they used to set them down, and you had to take a break?  Yeah.  That's why I was cracking up, I'm like, look at you, you fag, and I said, yeah.  Fag it.  Yeah, the wheel.  Making it easier.  That funny wheel, boy, that's never been convenient over history.  Yeah.  Anything's better with a wheel on it.  The wheel is just...  Anything.  The wheel is just a fad. 
[02:07:00]  I don't care what you pick.  You guys just described what I did.  Going to Vegas.  Why?  I don't have the wheels yet.  Are you insane?  I had, like, two duffel bags.  Dude, you're a crazy person.  I know I am.  You're a crazy person.  You're in a business where we travel everywhere.  Right.  And you don't have the latest, nicest wheeled luggage.  No.  When it took me 16 hours to get to Vegas and 13 hours door-to-door to get home, I was carrying  my bags.  That's insanity.  Now you're crazy. 
[02:07:30]  You...  We play a goddamn thing where he's got the insight to see satellite radio as something  that's going to be huge when everyone was like, what the fuck is that?  And he's still pulling around freaking wheel-less luggage.  I'll admit I'm a brilliant broadcaster.  I'm not brilliant in my everyday life.  Dude.  Get wheels.  I need to get wheels.  I just recently...  These people, it's like you and, like, old people.  Everyone's trying to see old people.  They still have, like, with the floral pattern, like, luggage, floral print.  Nothing beats that big, hard-shell green, like, Samsonite. 
[02:08:00]  Oh, to match their pantsuit.  Oh.  Yeah.  Well...  You hear it come down off of the baggage thing and it makes that big sound.  Well, the listener is just trying to get back on track here.  So, we have the listener sending in anti-free radio ads.  And the first one, right off the bat, is two minutes and 30 seconds long.  What is going on?  What did we say when we said we wanted you to send these in?  What did we say?  I'm waiting for an answer. 
[02:08:30]  We said, keep it short.  Keep it short.  The worst thing you could do with these things, worse than a short, bad one, is a long, good  one.  Yeah.  We don't want to work too hard.  I got to think.  Was that right?  If this bit takes off, we don't have to work as hard.  And already, you guys are wrecking the bit.  You're ruining the bit.  You're traveling through another dimension.  A dimension not only of sight and sound, but of mind. 
[02:09:00]  A journey into a wondrous land of imagination.  Next stop.  The Ellen is a...  This is Mr. Radio himself.  Once brilliant, but will soon have to be eliminated.  Field investigation finding obsolescence.  You know why you're here?  Uh, yeah, I'd say so, yeah.  You've been under investigation for the mandatory period of one year and 11 months.  You're found to be obsolete.  Listen to you. 
[02:09:30]  You are so jealous.  My show was revolutionary, groundbreaking.  When I came on the scene, people were not doing a thing.  You were obsolete.  Hold it.  Don't stop me.  You have no function.  I did a bit at NBC, going back to 1980-something, called the Bathroom Olympics.  They'd say, hey, let's see who can go to the bathroom.  We'll time it.  And we'll see who can go faster.  My audience used to eat that stuff up.  You're an anachronism, like a ghost from another time.  You better calm down.  You're a bug.  Yeah.  You're an ugly, misformed little preacher who has no purpose here, no meaning. 
[02:10:00]  Papa.  Yeah.  Make it brief.  Spiritual, spiritual, sexual.  Sit back in your chair.  Papa, don't preach.  Go ahead, baby.  It's all yours.  In my tits.  My tits inside God.  My tits are Godly.  My tits are God.  The state has proven that there is no God.  I'm keeping in my bed.  That will be all.  Well, I mean, I had a dream when I was, you know, like Martin Luther King when I was five years old. 
[02:10:30]  You have nothing but spindly limbs and a dream, and the state has no use for your kind.  I'm learning to be better.  You waste our time, then you're not worth the waste.  How do you find, ladies and gentlemen?  Obsolete.  Obsolete.  Obsolete.  You are obsolete.  Obsolete.  You are obsolete.  This is what is meant by paying the fiddler.  This is the comeuppance awaiting every man when the ledger of his life is opened and examined. 
[02:11:00]  The tally made, and then the reward or the penalty paid.  This is Judgment Night.  And the other one is up.  All right.  I remember that episode.  But it's not the anti-free radio ads.  No.  Why was I bunched in with this?  That's more of a...  Yeah.  That's like anti-Howard, a Howard Stern daughter remix.  Right, yeah.  Like it's three or four...  Covering all the bases there. 
[02:11:30]  Three or four different bits.  I think there was a Pat O'Brien sex tape in it.  I don't know.  All right.  It wasn't badly done.  No, it was pretty good.  It was a little long.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Keith the cop.  Hey, Keith.  What's up?  Hey, good morning.  What's going on?  Good morning.  How would you actually put wheels on a gym bag?  Yeah.  Ovi's decided he's just going to be like...  The white channel.  You're not going on a trip.  He's not going on a trip.  He's just kind of dropping in somewhere for the night.  You know, after he finally got there, and I met him at the airport, and I said, 
[02:12:00]  all right, let me get your bags for you.  What do they look like?  So he says, well, they're kind of like duffel bag looking.  And you see the bag come off the chute, and like the zipper's open, a pair of pants are  hanging out of the zip.  It's like...  What?  I just look at him, and I go, oh, very snazzy.  Fancy luggage.  Fancy luggage for a fancy...  What's kept you from just getting one luggage bag?  What's kept me from buying a house?  What's...  I don't know what's wrong with me. 
[02:12:30]  How?  I'm a mess.  Do you just, like, not like to shop?  And I...  No, I got...  I've upgraded my stuff, but...  Yeah, look at that sweater.  Dude, this is my sick clothes.  If you do that online, you could get luggage.  I'll bring it right to your house.  Because then the night before, I have to think about every single thing I'm packing,  because I know my luggage is going to be too heavy to walk through the airports.  Yeah, you're definitely not bringing any sort of electronics.  There's no laptop in your bag.  It's just like...  My brain is not wired when it comes to, like, this normal shit that people have figured out. 
[02:13:00]  When it comes down to the baggage thing, you just hear...  Because your deodorant is just spraying into your clothes.  Oh, I have more shampoo bottles than brain...  Just broken.  I was getting even telling you.  Goopy clothes that you're pulling out.  I can't even tell you.  All right.  Well, thanks for calling me out on that, Keith.  No, man, you've got to bring the toilet piece on the plane.  By the way, why don't you tell Anthony how happy I was when I found out in Vegas that  I was flying to the wrong airport. 
[02:13:30]  I got about 14 phone calls from different people to let me know that you were not very happy.  And, oh, it was a rough morning.  Somebody threw up a lot, and...  Not me.  I didn't throw up.  It was rough.  No.  But, yeah, you know, listen, we had a good time when we were there.  Right.  And besides the beating that you and I took at the table that first day...  Well, compared to Anthony, it was nothing.  Little three-card.  Little three-card.  Lost about 200 in, like, 15 minutes, though.  Yeah.  Not even. 
[02:14:00]  It was, like, 10 minutes.  Yeah, I saw Opie open his wallet more in 15 minutes than I have in six years, but, you  know...  I wish I could do my crazy laugh, but it hurts too much, too.  Thank you, Anthony.  I'll stand in.  All right, Keith.  All right, gentlemen.  Good morning.  Have a good one.  All right.  I don't get that true hatred in it, though, like Opie does.  He also has to, like, back, like, 10 feet off of the mic.  Yeah, he's got to back up, like, to the wall, and just, it belts out, and you could...  You don't just hear it.  You feel it. 
[02:14:30]  There's an emotion that it evokes.  Just hatred.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  All right, let's try some of the anti-free ads that came in by the listeners, okay?  Right.  To wrap up this segment.  This is Rugburn.  Here at Free FM, we believe there should be quality over quantity.  We strive to bring you the best shows in radio broadcasting.  For example, the Donna Mike Show, the Schnitz Show, Mad Dog, the Greaseman. 
[02:15:00]  Nah, fuck it.  This message brought to you by Satellite Radio.  Yeah.  Bill, comment?  It always happens.  The voiceover never has, like, any sort of confidence in it, and it's always so quiet,  like, XM Satellite Radio, Mad Dog, and...  Oh, fuck it.  It shakes a little bit.  All right, here we go.  We'll try the next one, which is... 
[02:15:30]  I'm telling you right off the bat, because we discovered...  We got a lot of fine black listeners.  Of course.  And we like them.  Patrice discovered that they have this whole underground thing.  They don't want to acknowledge their fans of this program, unfortunately, because of the racism that occurs in this program.  I meet plenty of people of color that are fans of this program.  Well, this is Johnny Griswold.  All right.  The house next door to me's been sold to me.  Hear the rest of that song, and many others like them, only on XM Satellite Radio. 
[02:16:00]  Holy shit.  All right, I have to laugh.  Wow.  Jesus.  Hear the rest laugh with pride.  With pride.  Make sure you crank it up for the neighborhood.  Jesus.  All right.  The next one is from Chris from Houston.  Doesn't get the bit.  He doesn't get the bit guy.  He doesn't get the bit guy?  There's supposed to be anti-free radio ads. 
[02:16:30]  There's always doesn't get the bit guy when we put the word out to the listeners that we want them to contribute to a bit.  And this guy, obviously, doesn't get it.  He's doing Radio Should Be Free.  Radio should be free.  Just like AIDS.  All right.  I like that one just because it's so bizarre.  Yeah, it is bizarre. 
[02:17:00]  He's kind of in the ballpark with it, though.  Like, he's saying that free radio is free, but, you know.  Right.  So is AIDS.  Right.  And it deserves to be free.  Right.  And the kazoo music bed was great, too.  Yeah, it was good.  All right, let's go to Snap Man.  Free FM.  Hey, at least it's better than that Kabbalah play.  Papa, don't preach.  Oh, man.  Now, why don't you just leave her alone?  It's just beginning.  You can feel it. 
[02:17:30]  It's just bubbling right now.  It's just bubbling.  Ah, that poor girl.  It's just bubbling right now.  She's a good kid.  Howie, she's 22 years old.  She's your kid, but she ain't a kid.  The remixes will start coming in tomorrow.  I guarantee that.  Them tits.  Those are women's tits.  How do you say...  Wow.  You see those things?  No, actually...  Great.  Big.  Little sloppy.  She's got some slop to her.  She eats good. 
[02:18:00]  We have Vamp Cry.  Is that his name?  You're asking Hawk?  Vamp Cry?  Why pay for radio when you can get great programming for free?  Yeah, really.  Like Diamond Dave in the morning.  Bozy, bozy, bop.  Diddy, bop.  Hit her in the uterus.  Ah!  Ew.  On second thought, I'd rather have Jimmy's fist in my twat.  Free FM.  You get what you pay for.  Paid for by the ONA Army. 
[02:18:30]  Oh, that's very good.  Actually, that's Jeremy and Rachel.  Sorry about that.  That's very funny.  Wrong track, cured up.  Jeremy and Rachel did that one.  Here's Vamp Cry.  Anti-free radio ads.  Free radio.  If you want your daughter betting down with Negroes.  Free FM.  My God.  You fuck me.  Hard.  Holy shit.  This is a celebrity endorsement with Jimmy Norton.  That's right.  Here's another one using a Jimmy line. 
[02:19:00]  Free.  The way the Jews worship it be.  The way the Jews worship it be.  The way the Jews worship it be.  The way the Jews worship it be.  The way the Jews worship it be.  It just sucks.  All right.  A little anti-Semitism.  Never hurt anyone?  Okay.  Maybe it did.  All right.  Here's Chris in Houston.  Anti-free radio ads.  So I open the door and she's sitting there shitting his f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing  f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f*** 
[02:19:30]  Ah, fuck it.  I'm going for broke here.  I'm going for broke.  I'm all in. 
[02:20:00]  That was a three for one.  You have to believe in your creativity there, sir.  You're on the right track.  Here's Inbred.  Bozzy, bozzy, bop.  Life goes on without me.  Radio.  Some things you have to pay for.  All right, he just shot the diamond tape.  Yeah.  And then finally, the last one that came in today, anti-free radio ads.  So confusing.  This is the description of the track. 
[02:20:30]  So confusing.  Just had to add to the list to see if anyone gets it.  By Wittendrun or something like that.  Wit and Run.  Oh, Wit and Run.  Right.  Okay.  Little Declan is 13 years old.  Have you seen my son?  The child gets thirsty.  I can't find my son.  Then he runs.  Mama, I don't want it.  Mama, not again.  What the fuck?  You can shit off for your family.  I'll pay for my nipple juice. 
[02:21:00]  Do you routinely use off-color language as part of your business lexicon?  The radio is in the hands of such a lot of fools trying to enecentize the way that...  Oh, good Lord. 
[02:21:30]  Idiot.  All right, well, wow.  That could have been...  If those first XM ads were as confusing as that, then that guy actually would have had a fucking point,  because I had no idea what that was about.  Yes.  I wonder if the first XM ads sounded like that to people.  Maybe Ken was right.  Yeah.  I want you to picture yourself.  Picture, if you will, driving in your car.  That was kind of good, though, right? 
[02:22:00]  Yeah, they're getting there.  The first batch is always a little...  I would have to say bit still on.  Bit still on.  Guys, keep them short.  It's shaky.  The wheels are shaking.  They're wobbling.  We've got some wobbly wheels on this bit, but I think we're going to continue with it for a little while.  Let's pull into the pits.  We'll tighten some stuff up and put them back out on the track.  It's like driving an old Chevette over 60 miles an hour.  Yeah.  It's shaking.  It's pulling a little.  But then when you got it up to 80, it kind of leveled out.  Smooths out.  Yeah.  Some of these bits, they're dead in a day. 
[02:22:30]  And others, like the Pat O'Brien sex tape thing, went on for well over a month.  Here it is, guys.  Keep them short.  Keep them short.  Make it, you know, the free FM.  Think of what sucks about free radio.  The commercials.  The lack of freedom because of the FCC.  The redundancy.  The redundancy.  What's the word I'm looking for?  You know what this sounds like?  It is something that goes over and over and over again.  Repetitive. 
[02:23:00]  Repetitiveness.  Thank you.  All right.  Yeah.  This sounds like when, like, everyone in the class flunked the test.  So the teacher just says, okay, we've got to do this again.  We're going to take the test over.  I can't give you all Fs.  Mark it on a curve.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  We have some audio from the porn convention from our time in Vegas.  We have John Montone talking about diabetes.  We love this reporter.  John Montone, 1010, wins news.  And I can't get enough of celebrity shows on VH1. 
[02:23:30]  Celebrity Fit Club is one of my favorite shows on TV.  Yeah.  And Jeff Conaway, who used to be on Taxi, and he was, what's his name in Greece?  He was K'nicki in Greece.  Well, he's now a babbling idiot on some kind of narcotic.  Oh, really?  He's not willing to admit it yet, but it looks like he's going to finally admit it in a future episode of Celebrity Fit Club.  That was the guy from Taxi?  Yeah.  We'll get it to the audio next.  Oh, wow.  You saw him and didn't recognize him?  I didn't recognize him.  And Kelly LeBrock.  Kelly LeBrock, yeah. 
[02:24:00]  175 pounds she's up to.  Stop it.  She's one of the contestants on Celebrity Fit Club.  You mean the chick from Weird Science?  Weird Science?  She's up to 175 pounds.  Is fat?  And 75 pounds.  What the fuck happened?  No, no.  She blames it on Seagal.  Really?  Got the divorce and said, fuck it.  I don't want to be beautiful anymore, and I'm going to do what I want, which is eat.  Loves meat.  When she's standing in the doorway with that half shirt and the underwear on.  Unbelievable.  And the little red light is behind her, and she's leaning again. 
[02:24:30]  There it is.  That's the picture.  Well, now show Anthony what she looks like today.  Oh, no.  I haven't seen it.  No, don't ruin it for me, Hawk.  This is what kills you, is she still has that same sexy voice, and now it's coming out of this.  I'm going to have to take a stand here.  It's a little controversial, I understand.  She's 175 pounds.  She's still hot.  You know.  She's still hot.  Once you get over the initial shock of, yeah.  I'm not even kidding.  I mean.  She still has a nice ass.  Yeah, you remember her from Weird Science and all that. 
[02:25:00]  It's very controversial.  I understand that.  Still sexy.  At 175 pounds.  Really?  Yeah, but you've got to admit, when you first saw her, it was kind of like.  Yeah, you were like, wow, that's the same girl.  Definitely.  Oh, no.  I said still sexy.  Now, well.  No, when she shook her ass for the camera, yeah.  Give me a god damn.  How did I get killed?  Oh, no.  Still sexy.  Especially in the face.  No, it's.  Oh, she's fat.  God. 
[02:25:30]  Let me see.  Let me see.  You bitches.  Sexy or not sexy, Bill.  Be honest.  No.  If it wasn't, it's because of what she used to be, I would say.  I would say no.  Dude, the difference obviously makes it tough to say that.  If I was in high school and that was my friend's mom, I'd probably rub one out.  There you go.  I'll put it in perspective.  As Kelly LeBrock from Weird Science, she was such a 10 that.  That's tough to see her any other way.  You'd shoot a load just looking at her.  I understand that.  There, she is one in every billion of fat soccer mom type women that are trying to remarry around everywhere. 
[02:26:00]  Right.  Trying to find a man at Parents Without Partners.  Yeah.  There she is.  Look at, from here, I see chubby indented knuckles.  God damn her.  She's already lost seven, eight pounds, though.  She's doing good already.  So maybe she'll get back down there.  Nah, when you get blown out that bad, it just never comes back to shape.  Yep.  Well, let's see what Brian has to add to this.  Brian. 
[02:26:30]  Hey, guys.  She is so seriously doable still that little Jimmy would eat the peanuts out of her poo just  to see where it came from.  Thank you for that classy response.  Thank you, Brian.  Great.  We hear from Brian the trucker saying, I'd still fuck her.  Yeah.  Yeah, Brian the trucker.  Well, she's not a mess.  She's not.  Yeah, but she's also not a truck stunt whore.  She's not messy fat.  Right.  But that guy.  I don't know.  Is there another picture of her?  Some girls could pull off the fat.  I'm telling you.  Show me a secondary angle.  Uh, she's, uh, I'm trying to find a picture of her. 
[02:27:00]  She's such an average fat, overweight woman now.  When you go, see the, ooh, that's an ugly picture of her.  That isn't her.  Are you sure that's her?  That is not her.  That looks really bad.  That is not her.  That doesn't help my cause.  Wow.  Dude, that is not her.  That doesn't help my cause.  I am not accepting the fact that that is her.  Anthony, it's her.  No, I got to take it. 
[02:27:30]  No, it's not.  Anthony.  You guys disgust.  It's her.  What happened?  Hey, can you get me a cereal bowl, milk, and a spoon?  That's her.  What happened?  I don't know.  That one's a weird one.  That doesn't even look like her in the face.  It doesn't even look like they pumped their face up.  Yeah, it looks like one of her cheeks weighs like four pounds more than the other.  Facial cheeks.  All right.  God damn it.  Yeah, I got to take a piss.  Celebrity Fit Club.  We'll do the Jeff Conaway audio next.  It's great stuff.  Anthony, that's her.  That's frightening.  You're trying to get rid of me? 
[02:28:00]  Yes.  What are you doing, Ben?  No.  Ben, what are you doing?  Sign language.  What's the sign language?  Ed, that's Ben.  He's our producer.  And he decides when a guest is getting a little too boring, and that was the sign.  What the fuck?  That's what Jim said.  More disrespecting.  Well, I can tell you, Anthony, that that's the last time I'll ever be on your show.  No, that was, yeah, Ben. 
[02:28:30]  I've suffered your insults enough.  I certainly wouldn't come back again.  I'll be glad to talk to you about the Columbia documentary some other time when he's not around.  Can I talk to you, Ed?  I'm a big fan.  I love you.  Absolutely.  Thank you.  Be sure that he's not in there.  I know he does this all the time.  I'm a big fan.  I'm very happy to have you on the show.  He is a, he is a, he's a destroyer.  He's a destroyer.  A destroyer.  He's like Gordon Gekko.  He's built nothing.  He liquidates.  He's filthy.  He's greasy.  Yes, he is.  I don't want to smell his shorts. 
[02:29:00]  He's a Sven-Balli.  In quotes, I don't want to smell his shorts.  Ed Asner.  Bravo.  The great Ed Asner.  The great Ed Asner.  Thank you, sir.  Very nice to meet you.  Thank you very much.  Where's Norton going, and where's Voss going?  Oh, you're getting photos and stuff?  All right.  Everyone is getting pictures with Ed Asner.  Dude, you went after Ed Asner.  I didn't go after him.  Oh, my God.  You so hurt him.  We were just having fun.  I think he was really upset.  I guess he didn't really get our sense of humor.  I don't think, no.  Our sense of humor? 
[02:29:30]  No.  The goof.  It's hard for people to get the goof.  Actually, he's a legend, and I loved Mary Tyler more growing up.  A lot of the old guys don't get the goof.  They don't want to.  They're like, come on.  But I can't, like, I can't be something of this.  You're a destroyer.  He called you a destroyer.  Wait till Anthony hears this on the replay.  Oh, it was phenomenal.  Hey, Jimmy, get back here, man.  I started shredding.  No, come on.  Give me that handshake, please. 
[02:30:00]  Fuck you, understand.  No, fuck you.  Dude, Ed Asner just said, fuck you.  Oh, that's phenomenal.  You're a destroyer, man.  I wonder.  Oh, that's a-  So, that's a a-  So, that's a-  I'm eating. 
[02:30:30]  Commercial cereal.  You sold out.  Stop staring at me.  I'm eating.  You sold out, man.  Yeah.  I think if you listened to that bed of music 12 times in a row,  you'd legally be insane.  Yeah, this is kind of a... 
[02:31:00]  We'll put this together.  Who is this?  New contest, by the way.  I just took the longest pee, I think, in the history of magic.  Oh, yeah.  You were in there a good 20 seconds before I was.  The Leslie Nielsen pee.  Yeah.  New contest.  Naked gun pee.  Someone's got to set the bar,  but when you have to take a really long leak, we record it,  and then let's just see if we could match that from time to time.  Call it the Bathroom Olympics.  Yeah, Bathroom Olympics.  Well, I was thinking that would... 
[02:31:30]  You'll eat that up.  Honestly, was it at least two minutes?  Yeah, it was a very long time.  At least two minutes straight.  No problem.  He's pissing 30 seconds before I even get in there.  I get in there.  I finish up.  He's still pissing.  It's still coming out.  Well, I'm drinking so many fluids just to try to hopefully kick whatever I have.  Fluids, goodly.  Bill Burr in studio.  He's playing the Punchline in San Francisco starting tomorrow night, which is crazy.  Tuesday through Sunday?  Tuesday through Saturday.  Saturday.  Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday in San Francisco. 
[02:32:00]  I'm going to shoot a DVD for $37,000.  Yeah.  Plus the cost of the tape and the cameras and the boom mics.  You actually have to pay yourself for being there.  By the way, very important news.  I didn't even know this.  Stamp is now $0.39.  Oh, I know.  Did you know this?  When did you find out?  Just because there's a line in the paper today or something.  It was yesterday, on a Sunday, that the $0.37 stamp, I guess it was, ran out. 
[02:32:30]  You can't use them.  You've got to get two more cents.  So I had all the letters ready to go out.  I am a man of the news.  And I didn't hear about this.  Why wouldn't you just throw another $0.37 on and say, oh, well, I'll catch up another day?  I'll tell you why.  It's the principle of it.  In the paper, they're showing lines around the block, people online, just to get two-cent stamps  because they got the $0.37 stamps at home.  And I'm thinking, it's pretty fucking cheap to mail a letter. 
[02:33:00]  So you get screwed one time, fuck it.  For one letter, yeah.  And then when the line dies down in the next couple of days, then you get your dumb two-cent stamps.  Why don't you get two-cent stamps starting yesterday?  You're right, but that's for one letter.  I usually buy a roll of like 200 stamps.  Right.  Well, yeah, but then you'll get your two-cent.  All I'm saying is you'll get your two-cent stamps eventually.  I don't understand these people that had to wait online yesterday for a really long time  just to get two-cent stamps.  Just to get the two-cent stamps.  It's like they're going to go see you two or something.  Right.  You're getting a lousy two-cent stamp.  And if you have a letter you have to mail and it's pretty important, then you know what? 
[02:33:30]  Take the loss.  That's what I was thinking.  Just throw another $0.37 on there and go, all right, you got me.  There you go.  You made a little extra money today.  Why can't I just cut the stamp up into equal portions and then stick a little piece on  that would have been worth two cents?  I paid $0.37 for the stamp.  Why not divvy it up and go, here, here's two cents?  They would not accept that.  I was ready to openly laugh at you, but that is a brilliant idea.  Why not?  I'll even give them half a stamp.  Look, you're still making money. 
[02:34:00]  Make it easier.  But they wouldn't take it.  A quarter.  A quarter of a stamp.  Because it would look like just a tiny little stamp.  Then I could use like four.  Yeah, if I got four letters to send out, I could use that and not have to waste so many stamps.  But why yesterday you decided to wait online for the two-cent stamps?  Yeah.  And don't say it's a rich thing because it's still beyond cheap.  Mm-hmm.  It is to mail a letter.  You know what, though?  I found out you can do, and I'm doing this now.  Online.  Online.  Mailing? 
[02:34:30]  Yeah, you get all your software sent to you.  You just stick your envelope in your printer.  Bout, bout, bout.  Done ski.  Print it on there.  It comes out of your account.  Never have to go to the post office anymore.  Just one more place I don't have to leave my house to go to.  That is getting scary.  The post office.  It's getting scary.  I am getting so to the point where I don't have to leave.  Although I will have to move soon.  But that'll be central command.  Yeah, well, then you're going to get like a movie theater in there or something. 
[02:35:00]  Then you won't even go to the movies anymore.  I'm looking, you know, Keith the Cop.  He has a home theater.  I don't know how many drug dealers he's shaking down to afford this, but he's got a home theater.  And he is going to hook me up.  Nothing against Keith the Cop.  Say hi to your old pal, Joey, from Paisano's.  That's another thing I've heard.  In the heart of Little Italy.  That's another thing I've heard.  He buys those audio magazines, those ones that make your head explode because you're like, what are they fucking even talking about? 
[02:35:30]  Right.  I want a movie theater in my house.  Call Joey, I'm telling you.  So then I can get, and then I'll go through XM and make sure I get all the preview copies of the movies because I watch them and then talk about them on the air.  So I'll get the first run movie sent to me.  Don't have to go to the movie theater anymore.  And all the money he's going to save on gas he's going to use to build a big wall around it.  Build it?  No, he's already done, my friend.  I'm putting turrets in.  There's going to be anti-aircraft on the roof and a motor. 
[02:36:00]  He's going to hire, like, out-of-work guards from the Berlin Wall.  Those guys could use some extra money.  Unbelievable.  Poor bastards.  I'm just, my goal is to type out some things on a keyboard and have it sent to me.  Why leave?  What's out there?  What is really out there to see?  We've traveled.  We've gone.  And an occasional cruise or a trip down to the Bahamas, I'll take that because it's wonderful, beautiful, and warm. 
[02:36:30]  But why go to the supermarket?  Why go to the movies?  You're not going to go to the Bahamas.  After a while, you're just going to rent, like, Blue Crush or whatever the fuck that movie was called.  Throw a little sand down on the floor.  Yeah, and you just sit in there.  It's some awful Robin Williams shirt that he'd wear on stage.  I will go out on vacations.  I will go to Disney.  I will go to the Bahamas.  I'll do that.  I'm saying you won't. 
[02:37:00]  I will.  The same way you could predict the future of satellite radio.  No.  I'm going to say you're not going to.  You're going to start phoning in this show.  Bill, I can say why I would go to those places because it's fun.  You're vacationing.  Why go to the movies?  They are annoying shitholes full of annoying people.  Would you invite those people over your house to watch a DVD of the same movie?  No.  They're annoying.  Totally.  But you're telling me those resorts aren't annoying? 
[02:37:30]  Yeah, but there's alcohol.  And you can walk away from the people.  You could walk to another area of the beach and go into the water.  It's not like you can walk out of the theater and still see it.  You have to be contained in that room, that ick, with those people.  Ick.  The supermarket.  Same thing.  You're wheeling that cart around.  If I get behind someone that isn't moving or that woman that stops her fucking, like she's setting up a roadblock on purpose,  that cart is turned sideways in the aisle, she's looking, standing in the middle of the aisle, looking at what she's looking at, 
[02:38:00]  and she sees me coming, get the fuck out of the way.  All this audio is going to be used at his trial someday when he goes up in the tower and just starts shooting at people.  Don't you get lonely and not leaving your house?  What?  Lonely?  Lonely for who?  Lonely for who?  He's sliding into this godly.  Human contact.  Human contact.  Fresh air.  New surroundings.  Something. 
[02:38:30]  Fresh air.  I got a yard.  If I'm in my apartment too long, I go nuts.  Fresh air.  I have to get out there and walk around.  You're mixing with the people.  You get some cum.  I'm mixing with the people.  When I walk from here to the garage, I'm seeing enough of the people.  And it's enough to remind me I don't want any part of them.  You even took the walk out of your everyday routine.  Just one way.  He doesn't even walk now.  I walk back.  You walk up the stairs.  I walk back.  I walk in the summer and I walk back to my car in the afternoon. 
[02:39:00]  That's got to be at least three quarters of a block.  That's all the people I want to see.  That is all the people I want.  It's enough to remind me I am disgusted with humanity.  You don't even have enough time to go, hello, neighbor.  Neighbor?  No, it'll start with an N, but it ain't neighbor.  Jesus.  That's a racist.  Right, though.  What is wrong?  It's New Yorker, my friend, with the filthy racist mind.  There is such an accidental shooting in his future.  Nah.  Nah. 
[02:39:30]  Accidental stabbing?  Yeah.  You should see me going on the trip.  What do you call when you run somebody through with a sword?  Is there a name for that in the corpse?  It's just called running them through.  Impaling?  Impaling.  Impaling.  An accidental impaling in your future.  You should see me going on vacation.  Well, going to Vegas.  The ritual around the house.  The packing.  What everybody else does.  But I have to go around to all my various weapons and unload them while I'm not in the house.  Because I wouldn't want anybody breaking in and having loaded weapons there. 
[02:40:00]  Or if a relative is coming by and staying, I don't want loaded guns like that.  So, as packing is going on, you're just hearing from different rooms.  Shells flying all over the house.  Telling you he's the next Jason Williams.  It's hysterical.  The fuck are you looking at?  He's going to blow away his limo driver.  Let me tell you something, my friend.  I am one of the safest people with a firearm.  I was raised around them and I am Mr. Safety.  You might think I'm kooky.  I am safe, safe, safe. 
[02:40:30]  Absolutely.  All right.  Well, we got the Celebrity Fit Club audio of Jeff Conaway.  He is the star of this Celebrity Fit Club.  That also features Kelly LeBrock.  Kelly looks fat.  The chick from The Cosby Show.  God damn it.  Give me the lineup of Celebrity Fit Club, please.  Oh, Chastity Bono.  That's right.  Chastity Bono, who was always fat.  Cher's kid.  Very big.  Fat dyke.  Very big.  That's what they say.  Also, I thought she was hot there for a minute. 
[02:41:00]  Young MC.  And they used to bring her on stage when she was eight, maybe.  No, it was the Sonny and Cher variety hour when she'd wave bye-bye.  Maybe it was because she was standing next to Cher, who was hot, and you just knew eventually  she was going to be hot.  Okay, he caught me in a moment.  I looked at an eight-year-old.  She was a very, very...  She was an adorable little kid.  A very cute kid, yes.  And then she had some problems, and I don't know.  She just ate a lot.  But then you got the middle daughter from The Cosby Show.  You have...  I'm trying to remember everybody. 
[02:41:30]  Tempest Bledsoe.  That's her name.  Tempest Bledsoe.  Tempest Bledsoe.  Young MC.  Very good.  Who's now over 300 pounds.  He's trying to lose...  Get out of here.  Young MC is over 300 pounds.  You know when he was looking...  Wasn't he skinny?  Yeah, well, when he was looking like that, with the abs and everything, he said that  he was starving himself.  That wasn't his body type, but the record industry made him...  Wasn't his body type.  Wasn't his body type.  What's his name from...  The record industry?  What, the one year he was on top?  Yeah.  I think it sounded like he's got a 20-year career.  1989.  That was it. 
[02:42:00]  Well, that's what he's saying.  He was fat before that.  He was successful for a couple years, and he was thin, and then he went right back to  being over 300 pounds.  Yeah.  And then the dude from D12, Eminem's side project band there.  Bizarre.  Bizarre, right?  He's there.  He just has...  He has a huge stomach, and he has this big tattoo right on it.  Yeah.  Well, because it's all about his belly.  He's made a lot of money off his huge belly.  Bruce Valanche, the comedy writer who's also done Hollywood Squares.  Oh, you've got to see that guy.  That guy is so embarrassed with himself, he has to just keep doing jokes about how he 
[02:42:30]  doesn't want to work out.  Oh, so he watched the show.  Yeah, it's really awkward.  I saw it yesterday.  I love this show.  What's her name from the park?  Markers, Countess Vaughn, or whatever her name is.  And then, of course, Jeff Conaway, who's just the star of this year's Celebrity Fit Club.  Where's the Jeff Conaway photo?  You got that one?  That's the guy from Taxi.  That's the guy from Taxi.  Wow.  He's trying to say that he showed up in one of the fitness things they had to do.  And the Gary Busey look to him. 
[02:43:00]  Completely fucked up.  And he's claiming he took two Benadryls.  And they got a doctor that's part of the panel.  Like, oh, Benadryl doesn't do this.  Those Benadryls are like heroin as far as people look at heroin.  He's slurring his speech.  Really?  Yeah.  And he's supposed to be doing this thing where they're, like, rowing in one of those Hawaiian  things, whatever they're called.  With the pontoon.  The kayak.  Oh, yeah.  Sort of like kayak with that extra part.  It's a Hawaiian thing.  Yeah.  And he's, like, passed out.  Just outrigger.  Sleeping on his side as they're trying to do this thing. 
[02:43:30]  So here's the audio of Jeff Conaway from Celebrity Fit Club.  Listen to this.  Why are you so angry, Jeff?  What do you want me to do?  How about just do what you're told?  I've done this for 45 years.  Longer than you've been a colonel.  Okay, well, then you should be mature enough to get in here and sit your fat ass in a chair  and let's get this show on the road.  When I was your age, I'd have you down like that, brother.  Hey, bring it on.  I went through more s*** than you've done in your entire s*** life. 
[02:44:00]  You ran into the s*** military because you couldn't do anything else.  I supported a s*** family from the time I was 10 years old.  I went through pedophile at 7 years old.  At 3 years old, I slipped my s*** wrist.  So keep your s*** mouth shut.  Hey, that's pretty impressive.  No one's trying to undermine you.  That's really impressive.  We still got a show to do.  And you're not being a team player right now.  Nobody told me I was doing a s*** drama.  Hey, all you gotta do is come in and sit down. 
[02:44:30]  I did a show called S*** Taxi.  One of the biggest shows ever.  I did a show called Grease.  One of the biggest movies ever.  They were funny.  How about lose the s*** weight?  Sit down and be quiet so we get the s*** damn show going.  That's what we need to do.  I got two movies coming up.  That's what I'm doing.  What are you s*** doing?  Right now, you're wasting my s*** time.  That's what I'm doing right now.  Now, can we start this?  See, that was the tape rolling before they even started the show.  He is angry.  Now they're just, they use it in the actual show itself. 
[02:45:00]  They were coming in to start the show.  And he just came in all angry.  More Jeff Conaway.  All right, Ria team, you ready?  Ready?  I'm ready.  I'm ready.  Rock and roll.  So, we're going to run this way?  No, you're going to run that way.  We're going to run this way.  Where's the water?  That's where the hills are.  Are you sure you want to go with his ass?  I was a sleepy practice, but you said...  Well, it was the Benadryl.  The Benadryl's gone now.  I'm fine.  You all had the confidence in him?  How do you feel?  We're not. 
[02:45:30]  Well, he seems more awake.  I'm ready.  Come on.  Let's go do this thing.  There you go, Adam.  He is wasted.  Gone.  You could hear it slurring.  Gone.  I guess later on in the season, he's in a hospital, like something really bad happened.  Oh, boy.  What happened there?  Did he say pedophile when he was seven?  Yeah.  Went through a pedophile at seven.  But then he tried to slit his wrists at three?  At three?  Yeah.  Isn't that just an accident?  It has to be.  Isn't that a kid that had an accident?  Running with a glass? 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  Man, I tried to slit my wrists at three.  Kid having an accident.  You ran with some scissors.  Here's your Fisher-Price knife set.  All right.  Here's...  This is great.  Listen to this.  Jeff Conaway from Celebrity Fit Club.  Jeff, in my job, I see people that are going through what you do that are able to turn  it around.  I think that we've been here for you, too.  I didn't feel that you were there for me yesterday. 
[02:46:30]  But I was there.  We could have not had you in the boat.  But I was there.  They didn't want you in the boat.  And we put you in the boat.  Look, you weren't here for me.  You wanted to throw me out of the boat.  No, she didn't.  I said everybody else wanted to throw you out of the boat.  Out of the boat.  The show did.  The team said that...  Well, then they should have.  Why the f*** didn't you?  You know, can I just say...  I think that's fair.  You know, I'm sick and tired of this.  Go take your f***ing show and shove it up your f***ing ass. 
[02:47:00]  Is this great TV?  Oh, yeah.  We said it.  Donnie...  Donnie.  Danny Bonaduce started this latest trend where you've got to get the celebrities on TV all  f***ed up.  This guy is a mess.  Because this is the simplest TV show you could do.  You go on.  You do a few jumping jacks.  You eat a salad.  And they go, hey, congratulations.  You lost five pounds this week.  And he's making it into this big, huge drama.  But what would be really funny is like the agent's pitching their client.  Okay, he's only like 15 pounds overweight.  But man, this guy is a f***ing alcoholic. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  I have never seen...  Yeah, that's exactly what they're doing.  ...raging alcoholic.  Because he's not even that much overweight, really.  He's like maybe...  I don't know.  They don't care.  They'd rather get some guy that's a little chunky and a psychopath.  I want to go on there.  I'm 165 pounds and attempt to lose 40.  And they just give me encouragement every week.  I'm doing the best I can.  Thank you.  This week, you lost seven pounds.  Oh, great.  I'll do better next week.  Get a thin guy in there to turn...  There's a couple like that, not Tempest Bledsoe, the other black girl on there. 
[02:48:00]  She only weighs 130 pounds.  Yeah.  It's like...  130.  She's like 4'10".  Oh, she's short?  Yeah, so...  And...  Oh, that's what it is.  Yeah.  Yeah, no, but she's...  Look.  Oh, her?  You wouldn't call her fat.  No, I wouldn't.  You shouldn't be in...  And there's...  Big club.  Yeah, that's not bad.  And then there's Valanche in the background, Bruce Valanche, who's just...  Oh.  Atrocious.  Well, you know what's funny is he waited this long to finally have a drug addiction?  I mean, his last hit was Taxi, right? 
[02:48:30]  Oh, Jeff Conaway?  I'm sorry, wrong guy.  They've been talking about Jeff Conaway for years in Hollywood, that he's just impossible  to work with, and he's just a complete asshole, and now he's showing the rest of the America  that.  He's bringing up credits from, like, 50...  I was on Rawhide!  One of the biggest cowboy shows ever.  I got two movies coming out.  Really?  Oh, the series...  Look up IMDb, see what they are?  He's known as the only guy from Taxi that really didn't have a career after the show.  Yeah, he hit with Grease, granted, but the rest of the guys were just massive after Taxi. 
[02:49:00]  I was a producer on Big Valley.  I broke Lee Majors.  So we'll be paying attention to Celebrity Fit Club, because Jeff Conaway is the reason  to watch, without a doubt.  All right.  Man.  Isn't that great?  Problematic.  If there's more audio, maybe we could get it.  Let me ask Danny.  Danny?  What are his new movies coming out?  What are they called? 
[02:49:30]  Uh, Sinjin Smith, and Living the Dream.  And what does he play in one of those?  Click on that movie and see what he does.  Doorman number two?  Yeah, let's see what his part is.  All right.  Let's see, uh...  Oh, he's down.  He's dick.  What credit is he?  One, two, three, four, five, six, seventh down.  Right before...  Rest of Cass.  Rest of Cass.  Alphabetically.  He's...  Rest of Cass.  Here, go back.  I want to see the last hit he had.  Let's see.  It wouldn't be Wrestling.  It wouldn't be The Corner Office. 
[02:50:00]  It wouldn't be Pandulsh.  It won't be Curse of the 49er.  Not The Biz.  Not Why Am I.  Not Do You Want to Know a Secret.  Dating Service.  Jawbreaker.  Jim Cotter.  Who's in Jawbreaker?  Uh, yeah.  Uh, uh...  1999.  No, no.  Different one.  Marcy's Father.  And then he did some Babylon 5 stuff.  Oh, well.  Babylon 5.  So, there you go.  98 about.  I think it was on and on.  Hey, he's working.  All right.  Hey, that's a nice positive spin from Bill. 
[02:50:30]  That was the best of it.  I mean, there is some stuff where he's kind of...  There's more slurring and more him just being, you know, inaudible, but it's really not...  It's nothing really for the reason.  Oh, it's fun to hear slurring, though.  Yeah.  It's not much, though.  I'll see what I can say.  It's the Benadryl.  Yeah.  That's the best part where he's like, it's the Benadryl.  I took a couple Benadryls.  Did you?  You're always blaming it on the Benadryl.  Benadryl should be flying off the shelves if it gets you this fucked up.  Really should. 
[02:51:00]  Because anybody that has a problem, oh, it's the Benadryl.  Right.  Hey, Bill brought in something today.  Osama bin Laden's daughter?  No, niece.  Oh, yeah.  This is great.  We were talking about this during the commercial break.  In GQ magazine, the one that has Jack Black on the cover, they have Osama bin Laden's niece  in there doing, like, this sexy photo picture, and on the outside of the magazine, they write  Jihad, Jihadi. 
[02:51:30]  They did not write that.  Yeah, meet the sexy bin Laden.  Jihadi?  Remember after 9-11 when they were talking about comedy just in general?  They were just, right after 9-11, they were just like, will anything ever be funny again?  Yeah.  How will we put the pieces together?  And literally, a little over four years later, you can jerk off to bin Laden's niece with  a joke on the cover, Jihadi.  That she is looking hot playing a guitar.  Daily News just hitting their foreheads. 
[02:52:00]  Why didn't we come up with this stink of Jihadi?  There's her in a bathtub with bubbles looking hot.  Yeah.  She's got the family resemblance.  And she's got the big, wide, very long nose.  If you were going to fuck a bin Laden, this would be the one.  She would have to be the one.  She would definitely be the one.  Now, where does she live?  New York City.  She's all westernized.  She isn't like a...  She's in New York, man.  Middle Eastern type fanatic.  She's in New York City.  Her first name... 
[02:52:30]  Her first name is Wafa.  W-A-F-H-A.  Wafa.  Wafa.  Wafa.  And she's going by Dufour.  Can't believe she didn't keep the bin Laden last name.  Oh, no, she didn't?  Yeah, no, she didn't.  And she's trying to get this music career going.  And evidently, she's having a tough time when she went by with the bin Laden last name.  Which you can't believe when she would introduce herself as Wafa, Wafa, Wafa, bin Laden.  And she says, it's really tough that I have to always explain myself. 
[02:53:00]  It's like every time I meet someone, I have to move this huge mountain that's in front of me.  And sometimes I get tired.  Yeah.  It's really weird.  It's almost like one of my relatives orchestrated two jumbo jets flying into the World Trade Center  and caused the deaths of over 3,000 people.  And it's like that's the first thing they think of.  They don't think of my music career.  I mean, I'm standing there with an acoustic guitar.  It's like, hello, I have a song to play.  Why wouldn't that be your first thought after I say I'm Wafa bin Laden? 
[02:53:30]  Hi, I'm Susan Hitler, and I have a ukulele.  Would you like me to sing Tiptoe Through the Tulips for you?  Would your great-grandfather orchestrate the deaths of 6 million Jews and over 10 million?  I am so tired of that being the first thing people think of when I say I'm Susan Hitler.  And you see the harmonica and a ukulele.  I see the ukulele.  Multi-instruments.  I see the ukulele and stuff.  But what's it like knowing you're related to one of the most evil men? 
[02:54:00]  You know, Jerry, can you remove this person, please?  Because, okay, it's like enough already.  Okay?  It was only 6 million.  It wasn't 7 million.  It wasn't 10 million Jews.  It was 6, okay?  Jesus Christ.  And it's about the music, really.  It's about the music, okay?  It's sort of a hip-hop-ish illusion.  That is a tough nut, man.  That's one of those things that on a small level anyone can relate to because you have the asshole relative. 
[02:54:30]  Everybody.  I got a relative who went to jail.  Went to jail, yeah.  Yeah, he's changed his name.  He went to jail.  My parents will not tell me what he went to jail for, so I'm assuming he's got to be sexual.  Yeah, sex crime.  But everybody has somebody in their family they can relate to that is an asshole, an embarrassment, someone you don't want to have the same name as, maybe.  But then there are other levels of it, too. 
[02:55:00]  There are, like, Billy Carter, Jimmy Carter's there, the president of the United States, got that asshole brother around.  Billy Bear.  Even, like, Roger Clinton was an embarrassment.  Right, was an embarrassment to Billy Clinton.  Singing Mama Kin on Letterman.  Right.  Very embarrassing.  Then, those are just embarrassments.  Then you have the other ones, like, I'm sure Jeffrey Dahmer's got relatives.  Oh, absolutely.  He killed a few people, you know?  Now, that, to some people, might be fun at a bar. 
[02:55:30]  Hey, it's fucking Jeffrey Dahmer's cousin over there.  I think we'd have a drink with him.  If you came walking in and you were just like, you know, what's your name?  Oh, my name's Michael Dahmer.  Yeah.  Dahmer doesn't, like, have the ring.  Right.  It's not just evil.  Yes.  Damn.  No Hitler.  You've got to mumble that.  What's your name?  Jason Hitler.  Yeah.  Job application?  Well, how do you spell that?  Well, let's take a look at your resume, Mr. Hitler. 
[02:56:00]  You know, can you see that guy?  And all he's thinking is a payroll check, company name, and Hitler on it.  You're not getting the fucking job.  Every time he goes somewhere and they do roll call, you're like at camp.  They're like, you know, Sullivan, Michaels, Hitler.  And people are just, what the fucking, is it goddamn Hitler here?  And you never use your name in the restaurant for the reservation?  Oh, ever.  Hitler, table for four, Hitler. 
[02:56:30]  Table for four.  I've been to a lot of restaurants.  Never, ever heard the maitre d' call for Hitler.  Or bin Laden's.  Or bin Laden.  Yeah.  Definitely won't hear smoking or non-smoking.  Oh.  Jesus.  Hitler, smoking.  Anyway, yeah.  No.  Well, there's an article.  That name has been retired.  Done.  Yeah.  As is the bin Laden name.  One of the few names that have been officially retired.  Yeah.  You don't find them?  I heard a lot of the Hitler relatives, they changed their name. 
[02:57:00]  Really?  They changed their names after the war.  Goebbels.  All right.  So I asked Valvo if he was hesitant to take her on as a client.  Who's Valvo?  Like some agent or something?  Yeah.  Some sort of like PR guy who clearly wants to bang her.  Right.  Like who's that?  What the fuck?  Celine Dion.  You know, she married like that.  Yeah.  That eight.  Yeah, that 80-year-old guy.  The older gentleman.  But he was just interested in my musical career.  That's what this guy's going to do.  He wants to bang a bin Laden. 
[02:57:30]  Well, he says, no, but I have gotten static for it.  Yes, he says, recalling a woman who asked him, what the fuck are you working for these people  for and taking their money?  What is wrong with you?  You know what?  In that sick, twisted way, you would want to just kind of flip her over, jam it right  in her ass, pull her hair and go, your fucking uncle did this.  Your fucking uncle fucking killed three, and just have her have to take the pain for it 
[02:58:00]  because it's the closest you're going to get.  Hey, we got a Stalin on the line.  Joe in Virginia Beach.  Joe.  What's going on?  His name is Joe, and your last name is Stalin?  Yeah.  You're Joseph Stalin?  Yeah, technically, yeah.  Come on, no way.  How does that work out for you?  Eh, well, it doesn't go well with the employers.  You put that on an application, that does have a red flag.  Joseph Stalin.  Do they just think you're being like a wise-ass, writing that name down?  What's that?  Michael Hunt, you're writing down Joseph Stalin. 
[02:58:30]  Do you write Joe or Joseph?  Joe.  Yeah, definitely.  It doesn't go over too well.  Joey.  Joey Stalin.  Joey Stalin.  Yeah, right.  Yeah, and that one, even, I mean, that one, Stalin was really, really bad.  Bad person.  Yeah, I'm trying to think how.  He killed quite a few million Russians.  The thing is, it was his own people, and it was very secretive.  You know, it wasn't really as public at the time as Hitler.  His whole murder, his flopped, you know what I mean? 
[02:59:00]  Yeah, it really did.  He had a lot of insecurities internally and took care of them by killing everybody.  Anyway, but it wasn't like an outwardly, it seemed like, hey, he's running the show,  whatever, however he wants to deal with his people.  It's like that Ron Howard movie there, the boxing one.  You would think you'd have Russell Cronin, Oscars, right?  And just nobody saw it.  No one saw it.  No one cared.  That's how his atrocity went. 
[02:59:30]  Didn't beat Hitler's.  Well, here, all right, thank you, Joe Stalin.  Joseph Stalin.  Let's go to Andy in Wisconsin.  Andy, what's up?  Hey, man, you talk about having a top one.  It's Andy Heitler, H-I-T-T-L-E-R.  Family actually had to add a T.  Oh, you guys went with the Heitler?  Heitler.  I'm telling you.  If you're going to change it, why don't you change the fucking thing?  Change it to something completely different.  Joseph Stalin.  There's no pride in that name where you want to keep a little of it. 
[03:00:00]  Heitler.  I changed my last name to Joseph's because I didn't want any fucking part of that.  Joseph's.  That's amazing.  Hitler's got to be a rough one to go around with.  Let's go to...  He ain't going to work for you.  Let's go to Chris in New Jersey.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  I know there's a Jewish girl that's a friend of mine.  She goes with a black guy whose name is Adolf.  What parents would name that kid Adolf?  It's the most uncomfortable thing because we're all used to saying nigger that it's just... 
[03:00:30]  Oh, Jesus.  It's the most weird, uncomfortable, out-of-place thing.  All right.  Let's go to Tyler in Wyoming.  I thought the uncomfortable was Adolf and that she was Jewish.  No.  No, the most uncomfortable thing is this guy wants to drop the N-bomb.  That just killed it right there.  Hey, by the way, what is a knitter?  A knitter?  Yeah.  Somebody wrote that on my site.  I assumed it was racist.  Oh, it absolutely is.  It was an OAN fan.  That's what you usually go with.  It absolutely is.  Yeah.  Some people send messages with, like, ridiculous... 
[03:01:00]  In your comments section.  And I have to approve all comments before they go on.  And they're like, dude, this is really funny.  And it's like some picture of a guy back in the 1800s, early 1900s, lynched from a tree,  a black guy.  And, like, he wants me to hit accept and click it so it's proudly displayed on my...  Yeah, comment on my page.  Dude, man, check out my...  I sent an email to a kid the other day.  I just said, could you please stop leaving unfunny racist shit on my site? 
[03:01:30]  It isn't funny.  It's not.  Dude, you just don't...  Fucking...  I thought that Bill Burr was cool.  Guy's a fucking asshole.  Yeah, he's a fucking pussy.  Guy doesn't fucking get it.  He doesn't get it.  Lynchings are hilarious.  Oh.  Tyler in Wyoming.  What's up, Tyler?  Yo, boys, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey, I worked with a guy over at Weatherford.  It's a crude oil...  Well... 
[03:02:00]  Station.  This motherfucker's name was really Jeffrey Dahmer.  No kidding.  No shit, man.  He was a twisted fuck, too.  Yo, that's going to be hilarious if you have some sort of name, right?  Your whole life, it's cool, and then all of a sudden, somebody with the exact same name  goes out and does something completely fucked up for you.  Oh, yeah, totally.  There was a time being named Jeffrey Dahmer, was there?  There was just some guy down the street.  You're right.  A whole page of Hitlers.  And there's a Susan Hitler, by the way.  There is a Susan Hitler. 
[03:02:30]  Get out of here.  Avon Hitler.  A-V-E-N Hitler.  Karen Hitler.  That sounds like a nice girl.  George Hitler.  A couple of them.  A Karen.  There's only 12.  Martha Hitler.  So the name is almost retired.  Almost.  There's only 12.  Practically, they're like protected by the government.  Missouri, Wisconsin, Arkansas, Indiana.  All over.  A lot of Wisconsin.  Wisconsin, Wisconsin.  All right, let's try to guess which city the person is actually a racist and is proud of  the name.  I'm going to go with Arkansas. 
[03:03:00]  Timbo, Arkansas.  Yeah, Timbo, Arkansas.  That guy loves being Hitler.  And his whole town, like, he is the man.  He gets free drinks at the Vox.  I'll go with another one that a lot of people know.  Powell, Ohio.  Ohio.  Ohio has a very strong, strong clan.  White supremacist.  George Hitler.  My name's George Hitler and God damn it, I'm proud.  Turney.  What else is in this article?  They look through her iPod.  Osama Bin Laden's niece.  Oh.  And she has 5,000 songs and they scroll through ACDC, Allman Brothers, Beach Boys, Butthole 
[03:03:30]  Surfers, Coldplay, The Cure, Lou Reed, and Mozart.  This is a funny one.  They're talking about the stiletto heels that she wore for the photos and she calls them  her horseshoes and then goes, that's so anti-Muslim.  Is she a Muslim?  Yeah.  But you know something?  I really got to, on one point, as you read this whole article, there's this whole vibe  where she wants to trash Osama but she's worried that she'll get her head chopped off. 
[03:04:00]  It's like being someone born into the mafia that wants no part of it.  Yeah.  You try to go about your life but you're sure shit ain't gonna badmouth anybody in it.  Right.  Yeah.  That's where she is.  She wants to embrace this.  And then you gradually get sucked into it and grab a gun behind a toilet and blow people's  brains out.  Yeah.  You gotta.  But a bing.  She doesn't understand, though.  She's talking about this interview with GQ Magazine and it's different than the other  interview she's done.  And she's quoted as saying, well, the guy's quoted as saying, it's so good to see you smile  so much. 
[03:04:30]  You used to sit there so sad when we were with the report like you were about to be executed.  Yeah.  Well, what do you expect?  That's what I love about what we do.  You get a celebrity that comes in here and you have the obvious question and the publicist  will try to get to you and go, could you not ask him about that?  Don't ask.  We've been asked that so many times.  Then why is he even here?  They bring people in.  Don't ask.  It's like interviewing her and making believe that has nothing to do with her.  Who came in with a starlet? 
[03:05:00]  Some band.  Guy was a singer.  Yeah, we fucked up that day.  That was early in our career.  Third Eye Blind.  Third Eye Blind.  Lead singer was going out with...  Charlize Theron.  Charlize.  Yeah.  And she was right there in our green room.  And it was like...  Before she really hit you.  They wanted to be about him and everything.  So don't mention she's out there.  Don't mention that they're going...  Kind of a bummer we never did.  Yeah.  We lived. 
[03:05:30]  We learned.  She wants to embrace the Western culture, I guess, and be, you know...  No, she grew up out here.  She grew up here.  I think she spent some time in, like, Saudi Arabia and said it was horrific.  Wow.  Surprise.  Yeah.  Do we have any of her music?  I don't know.  We've got to get it.  Is it on Dilette?  Do we play it on the fucking terrorist relatives channel here at XM?  Isn't there a terrorist relative channel?  Ready for this?  She also hates milk. 
[03:06:00]  Wait, not a cap of a roll, though.  Okay.  She hates milk and dishonesty.  She won't say whether she hates George Bush.  As for Dick Cheney, she never listens to what he has to say but thinks he's the Secretary of State.  Brad Pitt is a sexy hunk.  While George Clooney...  Are you going off article now in just your own spin on things?  Please.  While George Clooney is a sexy hunk even more.  And the best-looking guy alive she daydreams isn't germ-obsessed.  Teaches a little French on the side.  Friends tell her she's a talking machine, owns a pair of open-toe shoes with very high-red stiletto heels, calls them her horseshoes, like Bill said. 
[03:06:30]  She's a struggling artist.  Honestly, do I look like a spoiled brat, she asks.  I tell her no.  She has a good attitude.  I can't be otherwise, she says.  I would be, like, crazy if I had to take everything personally all the time.  I want to be accepted here, but I feel that everybody's judging me and rejecting me.  Yeah.  She's immense.  Well.  Persona non grata in both the East and the West.  She says, come on, where is the American spirit?  Accept me.  I want to be embraced because my values are like yours, and I'm here.  I'm not hiding. 
[03:07:00]  And then she talks about her mom.  My mom is always telling me that if I say something too drastic, I might get killed by a fundamentalist, she says.  My mom is freaking out every day that some crazy fundamentalist is going to say, how dare she say that?  And lop her head off.  Yeah.  Is her mom Osama's sister, or is her mom married to Osama's brother?  But her mother, Carmen, met Osama one afternoon, and I guess Osama caught her. 
[03:07:30]  Backyard cookout.  No, Osama caught her without her veil on, and he just made some disgusted noise and shooed her away.  Soon afterwards, he went to Afghanistan to fight the Soviets.  Jesus.  Shoot her away.  They ask her what it's like for her when Osama releases another video.  I don't even watch it, she says.  She hasn't had many relationships.  Wafa means loyalty in Arabic, but she can't imagine being faithful to someone for, say, ten years.  I think that even women can't be faithful. 
[03:08:00]  I read in a study, and I think it's true that after three years, you're not in love anymore.  It's more about friendship.  See, that's what made me like it.  That's a real honest statement.  You like that one?  Yeah.  Maybe you could hook up.  I'd bang the shit on her.  Yeah.  All right, I guess that's about it.  That's pretty crazy.  Well, good luck to her.  Make her wear the veil.  Good luck to her.  I'd like to hear her music.  See if it's any of that, like, little stuff, or if it's real, you know. 
[03:08:30]  No, she's really into, like, Madonna.  Is that it?  Do we have any of her performance?  Yeah, we'll find some.  We don't have it today.  I thought we did.  It's got to have a demo on up there.  She's the daughter of Osama's half-brother.  Oh.  That's the relations there.  Do we have some of her stage show?  More crazy names, by the way.  I don't know.  We'll try to find it.  I don't have it in front of me. 
[03:09:00]  You don't?  I could have sworn you had some of her stage show on there, but...  Oh, yes, I do, Anthony.  I didn't see it here.  Jesus Christ.  Pulling fucking teeth.  Dude, I told you.  I'm under the weather today.  Well, yes, Anthony.  I happen to have a sample of her music.  Would you like to hear it right now?  She's upholding those Muslim...  Go ahead.  It was under the Celebrity Fit Club CD. 
[03:09:30]  Oh, see, that's why you didn't see it at first.  Oh, there you go.  But now we're all on the same page.  You're a little love.  Here's Osama bin Laden's niece singing and performing on a stage.  Sexual.  Spiritual.  Spiritual.  Sexual.  Both-handed.  Sexual.  Spiritual.  I'm like hell.  The name of God.  My breasts.  My white shining legs.  My vagina.  My ass. 
[03:10:00]  We're all godly.  Breasts in Hebrew.  We're shod.  God in Hebrew.  We're shod.  Boy, he wouldn't like this.  Shod, I in Hebrew also means my breasts.  God.  And my tits.  My tits inside, God.  My tits are godly.  This is all the stuff they're going to chop off.  My tits are godly.  God.  God.  Wow.  I'm so happy I'm in the Kabbalah Center.  I've learned so much.  I now meditate on letters T-I-T and everybody will immediately notice my tits. 
[03:10:30]  Letters T-I-T.  Come tits.  All right.  Well, that's great stuff.  Yeah, there it is.  Sort of scat.  Scat singing.  Osama Bin Laden's niece.  The rest of that audio is on opianthony.com.  Make your remixes and start sending them in, boys.  Someone else that has an outrageous name of a co-worker they work with.  Yes, Paul in New York.  Yeah, hey, guys.  I work with a guy named Gregory Hughes.  Really? 
[03:11:00]  Yes, sir.  Does he call himself Opie?  Actually, we call him Opie now.  He just didn't realize why.  Thank you, Paul.  Thank you.  No problem.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  News teases when we get back with Bill Burr.  Yes.  We like doing the news teases when you're here, Bill.  We've been saving these for a while.  They're panicking us a little more.  Yeah, my favorite one is he's black.  Oh.  Wait to hear what the news said about that one.  Saw some good teases in Vegas when we were on there.  The news in Vegas. 
[03:11:30]  You go to another city and think it's only in New York City or the city that you're in.  It's all over.  They were scaring everyone.  And even their promo for the news, without mentioning a story, scared you.  We're here to inform you, keep you protected, and help your children.  Like there's danger out there, and the only place to go to get safe information is from these people.  Yeah.  Well, why don't we get right into it, then?  Screw it.  Oh.  Oh.  We're looking for people to send in their scary news teases from around the country. 
[03:12:00]  Scary.  Here's some of the better ones that we've collected in the last month or two, okay?  The first one.  A new disturbing blackmail scheme targeting our teens.  It's like walking down a dark alley in the middle of the night.  Our webcam's exposing our kids to a new cyber danger.  The I-Team investigates.  Tuesday at 5, only on ABC 7 News.  Yeah.  Well, I got to agree with him there.  Some of the shit I see.  It's happening today as we do our radio show.  Oh, my goodness.  Pal talk. 
[03:12:30]  Pal talk.  The rooms are up to what?  A thousand people now?  We're on pal talk.  Look, we can fit a thousand people in the rooms now.  We get more every day.  There's hundreds in there watching.  How does it-  Is that what that is right there?  Yeah, they have.  See, they could see you right there up from that camera.  And then the office cam is on.  If Danny's listening to the show, he can give a little wave.  They could flash their tits like that, girl.  There it is.  And then, oh, yep, there's Lil' on cam. 
[03:13:00]  Lil' on cam is a real trooper.  She is a real goer.  Shows them tits, and she's very cute.  And these rooms fill up with girls that just love showing themselves naked.  It's wonderful.  So how do the- how is webcams exposing your kids to danger?  I would think they are online, on their webcam, and being taunted to show their dirty parts. 
[03:13:30]  And before they can look away, there's some awful middle-aged man.  Oh, Jack beating himself.  Because here's what you get.  We have very unique rooms here, the Opie and Anthony rooms.  There's the Opie and Anthony live camera, which is the one that they're looking in on now.  And it's guys hanging out, chatting.  They got cameras.  Girls showing some tit and shit like that.  It's nice.  And them watching us do the show.  It's very nice.  Very nice.  Civilized.  But you go to some of these other rooms, it is porn on some of them, because they're just streaming porno movies. 
[03:14:00]  Women showing their tits and their vaginas and shoving shit in them.  But for the most part, 90%, the cameras zoomed in on a man's nude lap as he is pounding away on his dick.  Just jerking off.  It's cameras after cameras.  Just peep.  Guys jerking off.  Now that I know that that music bed wasn't scary enough under the news teaser there.  No. 
[03:14:30]  Not scary enough.  You know when they invented webcams, you think that's what they envisioned for this whole technology?  I think they envisioned video conferencing.  You think that's what they really envisioned at the time?  You're in New York.  Your business partner is in Tokyo.  You need a face-to-face meeting.  Thank God for the webcam.  That's what they were hoping for.  You're like, oh, we need more Toyota Bombas.  We need to send a Toyota Bomba right away.  You know, that's what they said.  And it immediately turned into, if I get a naked chick on the other side of this, as opposed to a Jap at a car plant, 
[03:15:00]  I could put the camera on my dick and jerk off while she watches.  This is great.  And the second that happened, va-boom.  Everyone's got them.  When they invent new technology, they always meant well, but it never pans out that way.  You've got to get the porn out of the way with your new technology, and then you finally start discovering all the things you can do with it.  Oh, yeah.  Do you know the monks, monks in robes with that first friggin' wood-handled printing press? 
[03:15:30]  Right.  You know the first thing they did was just some dirty monk word.  Yeah.  And spread the ink down and squeezed it and pulled out the piece of papyrus and went,  fuck, look, fuck.  I always wondered, who did the first person ever to jerk off while watching TV was?  Because right out of the gate, they came out with, like, Howdy Doody.  They must have been some pervert.  You think it was immediate or it took a while?  I mean, at some point, like, the first time you saw a beautiful woman, she's on television, all right, 
[03:16:00]  and all of a sudden you realize you're alone in your living room.  You're like, hey.  It's Uncle Miltie in the Texaco Star Theater.  Oh, fucking Uncle Miltie.  Uncle Miltie.  Hello, ladies and germs.  You're going to jerk, too.  Jerk it off to Edward.  Well, you know, when you were a little kid.  I think you had to wait for HBO.  No, no, no.  I don't think so.  Oh, John 13.  Remember when you were a little kid, when you first saw, like, the Sears catalog? 
[03:16:30]  Anything could make you dick hard.  You didn't give a fuck.  Yes, you're right.  So I think the same way with TV, even if you were jerking off the magazines and you'd see some stag films,  whatever the fuck they called them at that point.  Well, 23 Skadoo.  Skadoo.  The first time, what, Doris Day, one of those people came on the tube to hype their next movie?  The problem was never on there long enough.  The visual was never on there long enough to do anything.  Like, they used to go to, like, Tahiti on Channel 13, National Geographic Special of Tahiti. 
[03:17:00]  And they would show these hot Tahitian women, topless, just walking around the island, and boring Instaboner, but not enough time.  And how much time alone did you get?  Hey, you know, leave, leave, everybody.  I want to sit here in the living room where there's only one TV and jerk off.  Oh, that's right.  It's not like there's a TV in every fucking room and a VCR and everything else.  There's the family TV in a sarcophagus fucking case, big wooden thing with a record player on top. 
[03:17:30]  I'm telling you, somebody did it.  Someone, somebody did it.  Somebody with their fucking mic.  I want to know the first case of jerking off to the television.  And what they jerked off to.  Yeah.  Wow.  Let's go back to the news teases.  Let's say hi to Shwuggie real fast.  Shwuggie!  Hey, fellas, what's going on?  Hey, man.  Hi, sir.  Honest to goodness news headline I saw over the weekend on Channel 11 News.  Never saw something this low.  Parents driving over their kids in their driveway with their SUVs.  Could have happened to you.  Channel 11 tonight. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah, they've been talking about that one.  People can't see behind the SUV, so they seem to be backing over their children in alarming numbers.  All right.  Thanks, Shwuggie.  You didn't punch out.  You talked over me.  That's right.  Well, we'll do it when we have news teases here.  And when World News Tonight continues, back from New York, a deadly new trend.  Why are more and more children allergic to peanuts?  Can you protect them even when a kiss can be deadly?  More and more?  What are they saying?  If you eat some peanuts and then you kiss your kid, you can kill them?  It happened. 
[03:18:30]  Happened to a chick, man.  It must have been on the road.  It happened here in New York, I think.  Some young couple.  I guess they were in their teens.  I guess it was the chick.  She knew she was allergic to peanuts, so she avoids the peanuts.  But her boyfriend, I guess, had something with peanuts in it and then gave her a kiss,  and that was all it took to get the allergy going.  She had a little Snickers bar, skipping a meal.  Really satisfies.  And she's dead.  Dead.  Why?  Why are more kids becoming allergic to peanuts?  Is it something they... 
[03:19:00]  Yeah, that's...  I don't know.  See?  See?  That would be like, well, my kid's not allergic to them, so I don't have anything to worry  about.  More kids are becoming allergic.  Uh-oh.  Now I've got to worry.  When we do these news teases, they all end with cliffhangers because we don't know the  answer to any of them.  We should really have the answers to these, too.  That's not a bad idea.  Like, why are the webcams?  We discussed the speculation, but is it...  Maybe it could be like, yeah, the webcam's on and your kid walks past it.  That would make...  And they're naked.  That would make this bit better. 
[03:19:30]  You're right, Ed.  Yeah.  Because then we guess and figure out what it's all about and then we see if we're right.  We talked about that.  I could remotely access my home's webcam right now.  I could peek in right now and look in my living room.  Oh, people are going to get busted for cheating.  I choose not to do that.  Because when we were in Vegas, my girlfriend's mom was staying over.  I chose not to peek in.  Oh, you didn't peek?  I did not peek.  I thought you'd go for the peek.  No, I didn't peek.  You should have set the webcam up in the bathroom just for a lof. 
[03:20:00]  For a lof.  Just for a lof.  When you start to peek, does the camera...  Is it red?  Does the light...  Do they have any idea that you're watching?  That red light that you see on that camera?  I see it, Anthony.  That will come on.  That will come on.  But it's so in with all my other computer stuff.  The big giveaway is...  But this can be covered up, too.  You're breathing on the audio speaker?  Yeah.  The desktop on my home computer will come alive as if a ghost is using it. 
[03:20:30]  The mouse, the little icon will start moving around.  Like, I can access my home computer from this computer.  You know, Anthony, the more I do this show, the scarier you become as a human being.  Just nod.  And for some reason, and I don't know why, I take that as a compliment coming from you.  What are you working on?  Just what are you working on?  I don't have a goal that I'm going for, but I'm on my way somewhere.  You're preparing.  He's preparing.  He's stocking up weapons. 
[03:21:00]  I'm not really preparing for anything, though.  I'm waiting for the day when he goes, I can't do the show anymore live.  That'll never happen.  We're going to build a studio in my place, and we'll just communicate through the day.  I was going to say, he's going to phone in the show.  There's all the radio guys that do that.  They do that.  This isn't far-fetched.  No, I enjoy coming here and doing this show on a daily basis.  You don't have a studio in your office.  I'm not preparing, really, anything.  I think he's sick of it.  No, I really do enjoy coming here and doing this program.  Could you say it without shifting your eyes all around the room? 
[03:21:30]  No.  I can't.  I look around all shifty.  Let's go to Larry, the trucker.  Larry?  Yeah.  I was going to say, I was just going to stall.  When I was about nine years old, maybe 10, I don't recall exactly when it was.  It was late 80s, 87, 88.  I was just learning how to masturbate, and I had a real fascination with a chick on Alf,  you know, the curly 80s there.  I used to smack it off to her, and my mother caught me.  Honestly, it was absolutely horrid.  Nowadays, I'll drive down the road, I'll pull up a side of a Mercedes, and I'll be whacking my stack. 
[03:22:00]  And I'll be, like, looking down, thinking, you know, if they just only knew.  That you're jerking off to women on the road.  There's how many tons do those vehicles weigh?  Barreling down at 80 miles an hour, and the guy is jerking off.  Fantastic.  They're obviously not giving him enough time to make the delivery.  No, no.  He can't pull off in a Super 8 and just rub one out something.  I fucking love you guys, though.  I tell you, Larry.  You know, I did that once, and when the moment of... 
[03:22:30]  Truth comes, you lose, like, control of your freaking legs.  Yeah, you can't.  You break gas.  That was the first and last time I ever did that.  Like, this is way too fucking dangerous, because your right leg, it just starts...  It goes dead, and then it has too much energy.  It's all over the place.  I had a hooker jerk me off while I was driving one time.  Really?  Yeah, I was in Boston, and I remember there was a Comedy Connection,  and there was Nick's Comedy Stuff, and I was just starting out. 
[03:23:00]  That's what I'd do.  I would do, you know, my 10 minutes at the Comedy Connection,  and then I would drive over to Nick's Comedy Stuff,  and that's what I was planning on doing, right?  So I did my set, Comedy Connection, and I'm driving over to Nick's,  and I pull up to a red light, and there she is.  This girl, she just looked hot.  I didn't have any money.  I'm like, ah, I'm just going to say...  I just rolled down the window.  I go, listen, I don't have that much money.  I just want to say you look really good.  And she's like, well, how much you got?  And I'm like, ah, I only got like 12 bucks.  And she's just like, pfft, open the door. 
[03:23:30]  Open the door.  So she gets in, and she starts jerking me off, right?  And I'm driving.  I'm going by Chinatown in Boston, so she tells me to turn down this alley,  and I'm literally driving like three miles an hour, creeping down this alley.  And I'm like, I go, you got any lotion?  She's like, I got some $8 lotion.  I'm like, I don't know, forget it, right?  And the thing is, we went right behind this Chinese restaurant,  and there was like 10 Chinese guys on their break.  And I'm driving down the alley like two miles an hour, 
[03:24:00]  and she's leaned over like this.  And as right as I'm going by, they're all like, oh, it's just, oh, it's just, oh, it's pointing at me, laughing.  Busted my nut, dropped her off, never made it to Knicks,  and I went home, and I watched the Rangers win the Stanley Cup.  Hey, there you go.  Now we all know what night that was and where we were.  I see Mark Messier holding that up.  I think back to that hooker.  You know you soiled your up hands.  Brings you right back.  Yes, I did.  What did you do with the stuff?  Was it all over you driving home? 
[03:24:30]  Yeah, it was a crime scene.  Back to the news teases.  I think I had to sell the car.  Jesus.  Back to the news teases.  Let's listen to this one.  Life-saving material that's often tossed in the trash can help to save local children.  All right, all right, life-saving, thrown in the trash can help local children.  Yeah, see, we need the answers.  That could be anything from restaurants throwing away food.  Danny, from now on, we need the answers to these, all right?  Oh, what happened?  I don't know, a kid with spina bifida. 
[03:25:00]  Wait, what part of his body is that?  That's the back.  Are you kidding me?  It's like we're part of your spine.  ...and children with spina bifida in the United States.  We hope that she can live a long and productive and full life.  I know there's concern once she gets to New York about the kind of medical care she would get there  and the kind of follow-up medical care she would get.  That's great.  That's the worst line coming out.  It's like a rare burger on her back.  Yes, it does.  This is the worst line, but I'm going to say no one is going to hit that doggy style. 
[03:25:30]  Later on.  Jeez.  You're going to hold on to it like a steering wheel.  Oh.  All right, so this is like, I don't know, trash can help save local kids, and we don't know what...  And we don't know what they're throwing away.  You're right.  You know, there's something missing with this bit, and I think you finally figured it out, Anthony.  We need to know the answer, so we can speculate and then get the answer.  Okay.  Well, let's go with this one.  And out of control, new warnings about a popular form of birth control. 
[03:26:00]  This is Nine News Tonight.  Well, birth control always with the warnings.  But is it, can it give you the cancer, or can you have kids while you're on it?  They won't tell you.  You've got to tune in.  And we don't know.  Motherfuckers.  I thought we came and helped you.  No.  Sorry.  Now I know why this bit sucks.  Now I'm with the listeners.  We love this bit, though.  Yeah, we've always loved this bit.  It creates talk and conversation.  It scares you a little.  But now we need the answers.  We've got to take the bit to the next level for the next time. 
[03:26:30]  What do you get when you breed a pug and a beagle?  It's a pug and you get a breed.  The dog lovers can't seem to get their hands on fast enough.  But aren't these new design and much really a good idea?  Ah, no!  She made it sound like this thing is going to come in as you sleep and just tear your throat out.  Yeah.  And then the music hitting right after that.  Some sort of retarded dog.  You think the retard dog? 
[03:27:00]  I'm going to go with the retard dog.  I'm going to go with it.  Isn't that just a cool dog to have?  Retard dog?  Like what?  A fucking dog.  Sounds like a Carter's.  Retard dog.  Yeah, they're called collins.  Like we had a dog that was stupid in California.  And you could tell it was just a stupid dog.  But as long as they're lovable, who cares?  He doesn't have to do a math test or anything.  We don't have the answers.  And no, yeah, as far as the puggle goes.  I say don't get him wet.  I say the only danger.  Oh, or feed him after midnight? 
[03:27:30]  Or feed him after midnight.  The only danger a puggle can pose is if you're driving and you see one on the side of the  road, they are so adorable that you would crash your car because you cannot stop looking  at it.  You've never seen a cuter, more adorable.  I defy you to find a more adorable animal.  I think they're creepy and I want to borrow one of your weapons and put them out of your  misery.  Never.  And do your impression of the puggle in his eyes.  They look at you and they've got big eyes, big eyelashes, and they go, blink, blink, blink, 
[03:28:00]  blink, blink, blink, blink, blink.  And they're real sad.  And they always have the reflection with the window frame in it.  The little four squares, rectangles of pure white light.  Yeah.  Blink, blink, blink.  They are just so cute.  All right, here's the ultimate, uh, here's the ultimate news tease.  Tonight on CBS 11 News at 10, the water you drink, could it cause cancer? 
[03:28:30]  That's what people in some local towns are claiming.  CBS 11 News investigates tonight at 10.  Why don't you tell us the local towns?  Some local towns.  It's not even one.  It's the local towns where they dumped all the toxic waste.  Yeah.  Why don't you just tell us the local towns?  Could there be toxic waste in your town?  The water you're drinking could give you cancer.  Oof.  If you get it.  Could your balls fall off if you get too late?  It would be Staten Island Medical Center. 
[03:29:00]  Cancers of the throat, neck.  All right, we've got one more for today.  Scary.  I don't like having him at night roaming the streets when I'm out there in the dark and he's,  he's black and I'm scared.  And there is a strange creature running around this neighborhood right there for you.  Tonight, we know exactly what it is.  Holy shit.  That was back to back?  Yeah.  Wow.  No, it's the same story.  No way.  Yes.  That's the, that's the thing. 
[03:29:30]  They're trying to make it sound like.  Oh, I thought it was a black guy that the woman was afraid of and then their next story  was a creature.  That's why they're fuckers.  Oh, now I got to hear it again.  Yeah, you kind of jumped in to try to, or she did to like smooth it over.  Right.  They made it sound like it's some scary black guy out there.  Scary black guy.  That's actually something else that happens to be black.  Okay.  Maybe a bear.  A bear?  Damn.  Danny knows the answer to this one?  This one I remember the answer to.  All right, let me hear it again.  We got to guess.  I don't like having him at night roaming the streets when I'm out there in the dark and 
[03:30:00]  he's, he's black and I'm scared.  And there is a strange creature running around this neighborhood right there for you.  Tonight, we know exactly what it is.  What?  Wow.  It's black.  It's roaming around.  She doesn't like it.  It's not a bear.  It's not a bear.  It's not a bear.  What town was this in?  Oh, that either can't.  Remember the state?  State?  Section of country?  No, I just remember what it was.  Planet Danny?  You know what?  I heard a twinge of cuteness. 
[03:30:30]  Yeah.  In the, I'm going to say it's a skunk.  Oh.  I'm going to go the other direction.  Black, but the white stripe.  I'm going to go with Rocky Raccoon.  Ah, a raccoon.  A raccoon, but black, but it's at night, so it might look black.  I'm going to go with an elk.  All of you are wrong.  What?  You're all wrong.  All right.  Is it an animal? 
[03:31:00]  It is an animal.  All right.  It's an animal.  All right.  Let's try it.  Okay.  All right.  Is it a mammal?  Yes.  It is a mammal.  Is it indeed black?  This one, yes.  This one, but they could come in different colors.  Yes.  Their colorings do vary.  Is it a domestic pet?  No.  I got it.  Wild animal.  A bat.  Nope.  It's an otter.  A beaver?  I mean, what the fuck is left?  Nope.  I'm trying to think. 
[03:31:30]  If you knew what area this was.  Does it fly?  No, it does not.  It does not fly.  It's a mammal.  Can it swim, too?  Does it live in a tree?  No, it doesn't live in a tree.  It walks the ground.  It walks the ground.  Is it a mole?  No, it's not a mole.  Squirrel.  Nope.  Is it frog?  It's a fucking black frog.  Nope.  Is it as big as a bear?  No, nowhere even close.  Oh.  It's a rat.  Is it a rat?  No, bigger than a rat.  Bigger than a rat?  Small than a bear?  Cat?  Nope. 
[03:32:00]  Dog.  Rich Voss.  Rich Voss.  Okay, we're zeroing in on this now.  Bigger than a rat.  Small than a bear.  It's black.  It's a mammal.  It's not domesticated.  It could be another color.  I'm not a raccoon.  Can you raise it as a pet?  Some people have known to.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Carnivorous or vegetarian? 
[03:32:30]  I believe it's bald.  I believe it's bald.  Carnivorous means you eat meat.  Yeah.  And vegetarian.  I bet you it's a panda.  Oh, no, it can't be a panda.  And it's in...  Out west or east?  Honestly, I can't remember what state the story was from.  But you know what kind of animal?  Would you find it out west or out east?  Or, well, where is it?  Is it all over the United States?  Yeah, they're all over the place.  They're all over the place.  It's a buffalo.  No.  A cow.  Nope.  Fuck.  This is going to be sick. 
[03:33:00]  A pig.  It's a pig.  It's a pig.  A pig.  A pig.  He gets it.  A big pot-bellied pig?  No, this was like a...  It wasn't one of those small ones.  It was like a nice size.  It probably escaped from a zoo or something like that.  But it was...  A pig.  On the loose.  Wow.  Good one, Bill.  Why does she have to throw in it's black?  That's just so big.  It's black.  It's black.  And I'm scared.  I'm scared of its blackness.  Wow.  It was a big white pig with glasses.  She'd be just...  Oh, isn't that cute?  Yeah.  Look.  All right.  The next time we do this bit, we've got to get the answers. 
[03:33:30]  Charlotte.  Will do.  Thank you, Danny.  Danny just handed over some more Celebrity Fit Club audio.  Yes.  Of Jeff Conaway.  More slurring.  More slurring from Celebrity Fit Club.  Let's listen to this.  People's guess is stink.  Snake.  A gorilla.  A narwhal.  Narwhal.  Yeah.  You said an elk.  Jim Norton.  Like an elk can't hide.  No.  It made it sound like it's hiding.  It's in the bushes. 
[03:34:00]  Behind the trees.  Yeah.  Here we go.  Chat.  Yeah.  You all right?  If you don't want me to be Jeff Conaway, then go find somebody else.  I've walked off shows before, and I will walk off shows again.  Nobody wants you to walk off the show.  So let's calm down, and let's get back on track, okay?  By the way, Ant sounds so tough and looks so tough during Celebrity Fit Club.  Oh.  Stop it. 
[03:34:30]  He's the worst.  He really is the worst.  How does that guy have any television career?  He's got a huge hit on his hands, though.  Why?  I don't know.  Because he was on Last Comic Standing.  Yeah.  Which...  All right.  Here's Jeff Conaway.  That's it.  Search the country for some of the top acts out there.  So I heard.  But it didn't include a lot of the better acts out there.  Hop acts.  Because they were working.  Because they...  Yeah.  Anybody with a career said, no, I don't want to do this.  Do you want to live in a house with 10 other comedians?  No.  You know what?  I don't think I do. 
[03:35:00]  No.  All right.  Here we go.  More slurring from Jeff Conaway.  All right.  Jeff.  Yes, sir.  Let me ask you a question.  At yesterday's Fit Camp, you looked like you were in no condition to be doing anything yesterday.  Yeah.  I took two Benadryl.  I'd never done that before.  It totally, totally whacked me out.  I had no idea what was going on.  Just yesterday, Jeff showed up at Fit Camp clearly under the influence.  He looked confused, slurred his words, and had everyone concerned. 
[03:35:30]  He can't even walk.  Wow.  That is gone.  It's the simplest TV show, like we said earlier.  That ain't no Benadryl.  Eat your salads and do a little exercise, see how much weight you lose.  That was not a Benadryl.  Of course not.  Dr. Ian stepped in to see if it was wise to allow Jeff to compete in Fit Camp.  On your heels.  I am on my heels. 
[03:36:00]  I have flat feet.  Since this morning when you came here to now, you seem very groggy.  You can't really walk a straight line.  Did you go?  Did you take something?  I took a Benadryl.  You took one Benadryl?  I took two Benadryls.  Two Benadryls.  You know, I know Benadryl, and there's no antihistamine that works that fast and has  that kind of effect.  We're concerned about you, man.  I'm concerned about you.  No, I'm fine.  Believe me.  Believe me.  I'm fine.  Believe me.  I'm feeling no pain.  That was definitely something was wrong with me. 
[03:36:30]  It confused me as much as it did anybody else.  Yeah.  You know, I don't do things like that anymore, and I never did it at work to begin with.  So, you know, I'm sorry.  I took two Benadryl.  You know, I learned my lesson.  That I'm fine, I'm fine was every drunk guy when you ask him for the keys.  That was not, I'm fine, I'm fine.  He goes, I took a Benadryl. 
[03:37:00]  You took one?  I took two.  I took two.  You took two?  Seven.  You're not believing one?  Whatever number gets me through this.  Yeah, whatever number you believe that I could have taken to get to this state of intoxication.  The whole box, and the box.  I just shoved it in there.  I'm sorry.  I've never done that before, and I get it.  Apologize.  We have one more clip.  Jeff Conaway on Celebrity Fit Club.  He finally admits to prescription drug use here.  Exactly. 
[03:37:30]  What's happening medically with you?  I mean, what kind of medications are you taking?  And, you know, you keep saying Benadryl, Benadryl.  Yeah, I took some Benadryl, and I take a muscle relaxer.  But listen, two tablets of Benadryl do not produce the effect that we saw in Fit Camp.  You know, I don't do drugs.  I don't, you know, 20, 15 out of the last 20 years, I've been sober, you know, clean and sober.  To be very honest with you, in order for this to work, we're going to need you to buy into what we're doing here. 
[03:38:00]  Right.  And I have to be honest with you, the last couple of weeks, I mean, you have not been here.  Or if this is your being here, then that's a problem.  What have I been?  What are you talking about?  Even tonight, you're slurring a little bit.  And that's a concern for us.  You know, I've got medical issues, you know.  I've got torn meniscus.  I've got degenerated discs.  I've got herniated discs.  I've got in my neck.  I've got a prosthetic shoulder. 
[03:38:30]  Everything that I'm talking about is above the chin.  Up in here.  I'm not a drug addict.  I'm not an alcoholic.  I don't do those things anymore.  So, there he is.  I get this guy, though.  Oh, you do?  Yeah, dude.  You were in taxi.  You were in Greece.  You're fucking huge.  And now you're on some...  Look how fucking out of shape show I am.  I would be completely inebriated, too.  I wouldn't want to remember a second of it.  You know, you've brought me right in with you.  Yeah. 
[03:39:00]  Is that young MC?  Oh, my God.  You know the tale he probably got during the Greece years?  Ugh.  And the taxi years and stuff?  And now, yeah.  He just can't live with himself anymore.  He can't get a job.  He's got this fat show.  It's not even a reality show where you're the cool guy on it.  You've got to end the show standing on the scale, like, looking over at Bismarck Key.  There's not enough Benadryl.  Yeah.  Everyone should be slurring on that show.  Well, VH1, keep pumping them out, man. 
[03:39:30]  They're great.  I love seeing these celebrities in this state.  I've got to watch that and see that Kelly LeBrock is a slob.  Pretty big.  Oh, my God.  Check out Flavor Flav.  Trying to find a woman.  That show is hilarious.  Yeah, I've got to see that one.  Absolutely.  Have you checked that out?  Great show.  It is so...  Did you see the hot tub stuff last night?  I didn't see that.  I just saw them all screaming at each other.  And at the end of the day, they're fighting over Flavor Flav.  They're fighting over Flavor Flav.  It is really good.  These bitches.  These...  It's really good. 
[03:40:00]  Let's go to the phones and say hi to Charles in Delaware.  Charles?  Hey, fellas.  Today I learned that I would bang a fat Kelly LeBrock and a Ben Lawson.  There you go.  Let's go to Rob on Long Island.  Rob?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey, Rob.  Yeah, I've got two things.  First, I just wanted to thank you guys for putting a bit on Foundry that me and my friend  made.  It's been getting a lot of downloads.  What bit?  The little kid reenacting the Jimmy bit.  Oh, we've got to get to that.  I have it in front of me.  We got this when we were in Vegas.  We still haven't played it for everyone. 
[03:40:30]  I hear this bit is really, really funny.  Funny.  Yeah, it's me and little Connor, the guy in the diaper from the Christmas party, Halloween  party.  Someone's got to remind us to play this tomorrow morning.  Can we get the original bit, too, so people understand what it's all about?  Iraq, do you remember?  All right.  Well, I'll tell you what I learned.  I learned that Grandpa Hoo-Hoo is about eight months behind on his material than you guys.  Yeah, he got awful reviews on his first show today, by the way.  It's all over the internet.  Yikes.  I'll be studying the transcripts later, definitely.  You've got to know your enemy. 
[03:41:00]  Okay, guys.  Don't see you later.  But it was a disaster of a first show.  Let's say hi to Dave in Tennessee.  Dave, what's up?  Hey, good morning, guys.  I learned everything's better with wheels.  Absolutely.  Bill Burr, that's it for you, unfortunately?  Yeah.  I'll be in all next week, though.  Punchline San Francisco, Tuesday through Saturday.  Hey, man.  I'm out of here. </pre>
