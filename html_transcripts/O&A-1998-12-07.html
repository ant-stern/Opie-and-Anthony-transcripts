<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with Anthony recounting his lazy Sunday recovery from a Saturday wedding, quickly segueing into a heated debate about a controversial Jets game and the shortcomings of instant replay.  This led to a plug for their website's "instant feedback" feature and a Take Paws pet adoption campaign.  The hosts then critiqued VH1's "Behind the Music," mocking its formulaic nature and repetitive stock footage, before shifting to MTV's "Fanatic," specifically targeting a Hanson-obsessed fan.  Anthony confessed to his late-night Half-Life gaming addiction, prompting Opie's concern about his increasing isolation.

Listener feedback was addressed, followed by Anthony's disgruntled account of poor wedding service.  This transitioned into a highly offensive joke about a JonBen√©t Ramsey magazine cover, spiraling into a bizarre comparison involving the Olsen twins and prepubescent African girls' breasts.  The "Ugly Bride" segment then commenced, a listener contest to guess which bride in the Newsday wedding section Opie and Anthony deemed the ugliest.  Discussion afterward turned to previous guest Stephen Lynch, featuring snippets of his potentially offensive songs, including one about the Special Olympics.

A commercial break promoted "Cigars Around the World," a cigar-of-the-month club.  The hosts shared anecdotes about their experiences at radio awards shows, highlighting an uncomfortable encounter with Charles Osgood. The show concluded with a lengthy, highly inappropriate segment speculating about Dr. Smith from "Lost in Space" and his alleged pedophilic tendencies towards Will Robinson.  The broadcast ended with final plugs for upcoming events.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York, David Bowie, Eve 6 before that, Inside Out.  Good afternoon, it's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, well rested from the weekend?  Oh yeah.  And ready to rock once again?  Feeling good.  Are you feeling good?  Yeah.  You had that wedding Saturday night.  Yes, I did.  And knowing Anthony, I have a feeling that you didn't do much yesterday.  Yesterday, me and Jen spent, it was our little white trash day at home.  And we have a pull-out bed in the living room. 
[00:00:30]  We pull it out.  I didn't get out of sweats.  Ordered pizza, Chinese food, and just like laid in bed.  Like two lumps of crap.  You didn't go out yesterday?  It was like the sickest day of the year.  What?  It was what?  It was like 78 degrees yesterday.  Was it?  You honestly didn't walk outside?  Didn't even step out.  I picked up yesterday's newspaper this morning, today.  Oh man.  Didn't even venture outside for anything.  Had everything delivered to the house.  Must have been a great wedding Saturday. 
[00:01:00]  Whew.  Wow.  Did you have to do the conga line or anything?  No, I didn't dance.  I did one slow dance, you know, with Jen.  Because you have stated in the past that you hate weddings.  Well, you know, people always try to get you to dance.  And I'm not going to get up and dance.  I don't do the conga line through the kitchen.  Ooh.  The chicken dance.  I'm not going to do any of that.  So, whenever I go to a wedding, I...  Do you at least dance to New York, New York? 
[00:01:30]  That's a favorite to close all weddings.  Ugh.  I don't dance.  I sit.  They bring me booze.  And that's how I enjoy a wedding.  That's it.  And then, yes.  Thank you very much.  And then, yesterday, you're on your pull-out bed all day.  That's how it works.  That's why I like the Saturday weddings.  Did you at least tune in the jet game?  Oh my God.  What are you feeling today?  I'm a huge jet fan.  And I just can't feel good about yesterday's victory.  I've discussed this with a bunch of my pals and stuff.  Well, Seattle got kind of screwed on that call. 
[00:02:00]  They got screwed.  They got robbed.  And a few people made this statement to me.  They're like, yeah, but think of the games the Jets have been screwed on in the past.  I guess it equals out.  It equals out.  But I just don't feel good about yesterday's victory.  It's on the front page of every paper.  He missed it by a yard.  I'll tell you, it all equals out in the end as far as a play-by-play goes.  But something like this, a screw-up like this, the Jets will have to have like 50 of those  pass interference calls and bad calls that don't result in the winning of a game. 
[00:02:30]  I think Bill Parcells has the biggest balls in the NFL, though.  The play he called for Testa Verity to go for the end zone was insane.  Yeah.  Had everyone lined up, no one in the backfield, and just running it up the middle like that.  Yeah.  I thought it was pretty ballsy, but even though technically he didn't make.  No, I just don't feel good about the win.  I'm sorry.  He's down, and then Testa Verity grabs the ball and puts it over the line.  Get down already.  Where are you going with that ball? 
[00:03:00]  Come on.  What's going on in his head today?  He knows that he didn't make it.  Of course.  He's covering it up.  And while he's on the ground, he's pushing the ball forward over the goal line.  And you think he feels good about himself today?  Doesn't matter.  Jet's victory.  But do you think these guys just say, hey, we got away with one.  Let's move on.  That's it.  I think that's what they say and what they got to do.  And I know everyone's talking about this today, but got to bring back the instant replay.  Just got to.  But we just make it so complicated. 
[00:03:30]  The last time they had the instant replay, it took them 15 minutes to go over the play  and make sure it's, you know, inconclusive and all that.  Just look at the play real fast and make your call.  Well, with a sport like football, which is very technical and regimented and measured out,  I mean, do they bring out the chain and stuff?  Oh, it's short by a quarter of an inch.  And then some guy could just blow a call like this and ruin it all.  Yeah.  But they got to bring back the instant replay. 
[00:04:00]  They got to figure out how it could work for everyone because the refs are just blowing  a lot of calls this year.  Which is obvious.  As you look at the front page.  Whoops.  One for us.  Why not?  What the heck?  Studio Fax Line, 212-957-WNEW.  Phone's ringing like crazy.  We don't need to give that out.  And something we haven't talked about, a lot of the faithful listeners know about it,  but we're picking up new listeners every week here.  We got something called the instant feedback.  Yes.  So if you're surfing around at work or something and you want to make a quick comment about 
[00:04:30]  something we're talking about, just go to the WNEW website and you could whip off an  email that goes right to us right here in the studio.  Yeah, it's on our little page.  When you go to the air staff section, you click on our pictures and you'll get to fill  out your little comments and send them right to us.  And Anthony reads all of those instant feedbacks as the music is playing.  And it's only available when we're on the air from 3 to 7.  All right.  Give a gift of value this season and adopt a Take Paws pet for those special persons on  your list. 
[00:05:00]  This was a huge hit for Anthony's wife, Jennifer.  Oh, she loved it.  She loved it.  What are you going to do?  Go to the store and stand on the Christmas lines they're showing on the news?  You see those things?  Yes.  Nightmare.  I'm standing on line.  Are you going to go to the jewelry store and get something that she doesn't like?  These things are great.  You don't have to leave the house.  You can log on to the website.  Take Paws with a Z dot com or call toll free 1-800-682-2266.  And you get these things.  They're delivered to you.  It's a you can get a Bengal tiger or a panther or a lion. 
[00:05:30]  They're very cute, very cuddly and they're collectible.  Yes.  They're very lifelike.  Yeah.  They kind of the eyes on these things are scary.  It stares at me.  The one I took home.  It's up on the shelf and I look over and it's like.  So then you move to the other side of the room and the eyes are still looking at you.  How does that happen?  I don't get that.  You know what?  I figured it out.  Most of the like they get these cheapy stuffed animals.  They have like button eyes that are sewn on the outside.  These things are made where the eyes are kind of covered by the eyelid and they're very realistic looking. 
[00:06:00]  They're frightening.  Yeah.  But they're the girls love them.  And just like the Beanie Babies and the Hummels and stuff, they are collectibles.  They're going to be worth something.  This is like the first run.  Yep.  The first generation, I should say.  And if you want to take a look at a picture of a take pause pet for yourself, just log on to their website.  Like Anthony said, 1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York, Blind Melon, No Rain.  It's Opie and Anthony on the way.  Metallica doing Turn the Page.  And Lou Reed walking on the wild side. 
[00:06:30]  But from time to time we get, actually on a daily basis, we get requests from you faithful listeners to replay some of our pranks and stuff.  And we've been getting a lot of email and phone calls on the Bush Trimmer guy.  Yeah, the dumbest individual on the face of the earth.  Pretty much.  He was going through the papers.  He saw a classified ad for a job.  I think they were looking for a landscaper, I guess.  Mm-hmm.  And he called us instead of the landscaper.  He mis-dialed.  Yeah.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW, Metallica doing Turn the Page from Garage Inc. 
[00:07:00]  Lou Reed, before that, by request, it's Opie and Anthony.  And by far my favorite behind the music thus far is the Metallica one.  Oh, and the VH one?  I love that show.  Yeah.  I have a problem with the show, but I love it.  Because every story is exactly the same.  It's a bunch of guys get together.  They live in a house in a one-room apartment, five or six guys.  They have no money. 
[00:07:30]  Then they make it.  They're huger than life.  Then there's some nasty tragedy, and one guy goes wrong.  Either he dies or goes on drugs for 10 years.  Yeah.  And then at the end of the show, there's the big comeback, and everyone's doing okay,  except for the guys that die.  Could they get a little more money in their budget, though, and film a new road?  What do you mean?  Well, every time they go to the tragedy part where a car wreck is involved,  they have the black and white shot, kind of shaky, going down this road, 
[00:08:00]  and then tragedy struck.  Out of nowhere, Shania's parents were killed in a crash.  And they show the dirt road.  And Metallica, same thing.  Their bus, on the way.  Tragedy struck.  Wait a minute.  It's the same footage you're saying?  Yeah.  It's the same road that Shania's parents were on.  Is it the same road that KC, of KC and the Sunshine Band, had his accident?  Exact same road.  Because it's just, you know, they're speaking figuratively.  Yeah.  Here's a road, you know. 
[00:08:30]  And then tragedy struck.  Huh.  It's like the same road.  Get a new road.  I'm going to have to look for that.  And they're just, now they're pumping out so many that it kind of loses its oomph.  Yeah, the series is getting watered down a little.  It started with actual musicians that are now dead.  Jim Croce.  It would seem that's how it would have to be.  Full of tragedy.  Andy Gibb was a good one.  That was a great one.  He just gets all drugged out.  And he's a mess.  And his brothers are trying to help him.  Hey, Andy.  Don't drink so much. 
[00:09:00]  And then he dies.  Yeah.  But now it's just, you know, Fleetwood Mac.  What don't we know?  All right.  They were all screwed up on drugs.  But, all right, they pulled it together.  Yes.  And they got the band back together again.  Mm-hmm.  I don't know.  It's not very interesting.  The REM one last night was pretty good.  Yeah.  That wasn't bad.  I was watching some of that.  Metallica's the best one.  Yeah, that was definitely a good one.  I mean, there's nothing else on TV to watch.  Oh.  I got to go to the Discovery Channel, A&E, and then VH1 and MTV. 
[00:09:30]  MTV, stupidest show on TV, that fanatic show.  Yeah.  Is this like a perfect opportunity for stalkers to get close to their, uh...  I'm going to write a letter.  I'm her biggest fan.  Yeah.  I love Shania Twain.  Yeah.  You're right.  If I could only meet her.  She's a dirty girl.  I have to kill her.  These stars are meeting these fanatics, and I swear that they're pretty damn close to stalking 
[00:10:00]  them and killing them.  Yeah, you don't want to...  Some of these people are just losers.  Scariest one of them all, though, to this day, is the guy...  Oh, the Hanson!  ...that wanted to see Hanson.  Yeah.  Like, next fanatic, it's Hanson.  So you're like, all right, we're going to watch some 14-year-old girl drooling over  Hanson.  Lose her mind, yeah.  Right.  Oh, my God, Hanson!  In the limo, the whole thing.  Oh, how cute.  Yeah.  Here's...  I've been interested in Hanson for a couple of years now. 
[00:10:30]  When they sing, I feel like they're singing about me.  He was a senior in high school.  Yeah.  Oh, my Lord.  I want to know how MTV's makeup department covered up all the black and blues from him  getting beaten at school every day for wearing his Hanson shirt.  Yeah.  If I was still in high school and I said I was going to be on MTV's fanatic show because  I like Hanson, I don't think...  Hanson.  I don't think I'd live that one down too fast.  And he was all thrilled.  He got out of the limo and he runs up to Hanson, and he's even thrilled to meet Frank 
[00:11:00]  and Hanson.  It's our biggest fan, Lily.  Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.  Yeah.  Well, the two little ones, the two little chicks, they looked at him and you could tell in their  eyes, they're like, oh, this is not what I was expecting whatsoever.  Yeah.  They wanted like the little girl or something.  And Frank and Hanson, he's kind of not all there.  He was just all cheery and happy like, oh, hi.  How are you?  This is great. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  But that fanatic show, I don't know.  Yeah.  Well, that's why I...  I should change the name to Stalkers.  That's why I spend all my time in front of my computer.  Three in the morning last night, oh.  Playing Half-Life?  I went to sleep, yes.  At three in the morning, I was playing Half-Life.  I'm getting good, though.  These little 12, 13-year-old kids, I'm kicking their ass on that game.  I'm starting to worry about you.  Why, why?  Well, we've only been on the air an hour today. 
[00:12:00]  I've learned that you didn't go outside yesterday.  Yeah.  It was probably 80 degrees and sunny.  Yeah.  You didn't even step out your front door once.  No.  Stayed in bed all day.  Mm-hmm.  Ordered food and had it brought to you.  Yes.  You didn't even go out to get like cake out.  You had the people bring it to you, a la like Elvis.  I swear, the newspapers for yesterday were still on the lawn this morning when I walked  out of the house.  And then you stayed up until three in the morning playing Half-Life.  Yeah.  It's getting grim, man. 
[00:12:30]  Do you eat peanut butter and nanner sandwiches, too?  I've got me my peanut butter and nanner sandwiches, and I ain't leaving the goddamn house.  I'm going to stay home.  I'm like an agoraphobic these days.  Yeah, what's going on with you?  I don't know.  I enjoy my time at home.  That's weird.  The Rock of New York, 1027-WNEW, Rush, Spirit of Radio, especially for Spiro and the gang  at Bex's Grill in Port Washington.  Those guys totally rock.  They have us on every afternoon in the kitchen as they're making their meals, man. 
[00:13:00]  Thanks, guys.  We appreciate that a lot.  So, Pete Anthony, Tuesday is coming.  I hope to join the club this week.  Facts coming in here.  P.S.  Whichever one of you stayed in yesterday, seek help.  It was 75 degrees out.  All right.  The listeners are speaking.  If I hadn't been at a very lovely wedding on Saturday where I drank a lot, man, it's...  We went to a wedding, Sherry, great friend of ours, at Lockfield Manor. 
[00:13:30]  The wedding capital of the world.  Yes.  Yes.  On Long Island, by the way.  And a friend of mine, this guy JP, who I used to know years ago, is now working there.  This guy was like the shot king.  Just kept bringing him over.  And I said, yeah, can I have a J.D. and Coke?  I want a J.D. and Coke.  I got J.D.  No Coke in there. 
[00:14:00]  So, I had to order a Coke and pour it into the glass.  I'm mixing at the table.  But he was definitely trying to take care of you, Anthony.  Yeah, but that doesn't take care of me.  I appreciate it.  You're a big radio star now, Jack and Coke.  He's going to take care of you and give you all jacked.  I appreciate the effort, but I want to enjoy the drink.  Yeah, I'll just, I don't know.  I had a great time, though.  Thank you.  Very cool.  Don't forget, it's another N.E.W. premiere broadcast.  Lenny Kravitz concert special this Thursday at 10 p.m. 
[00:14:30]  Keep that in mind.  That's going to be cool.  Very cool to check out.  Why are you looking at the cover of People?  Who's on it?  Well, once again, we have JonBenet Ramsey, Opie, on another cover of People magazine.  How many does that make?  I don't know, but will they just arrest the parents already?  You know, if I could say something, you take off the makeup and the hairdo and everything,  she's not all that hot.  Oh, my God.  Right?  I can't be associated with that.  What? 
[00:15:00]  I mean like she's just a regular kid.  And you say I'm sicker than you?  What?  You know what I mean.  No, I don't know what you mean.  You're like, you know.  You're a pedophile.  No, I didn't mean it that way.  I just mean, you know.  Well, how did you mean it then, Anthony?  Do they take off the makeup and the jewelry and the clothes and she's not that hot?  Well, I just mean, you know, like she looks like a regular kid.  Yeah.  Yes, you are.  Yeah.  Well, I thought we were having fun.  Yeah, and people talk about how sick I am.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:15:30]  You are sick.  I'm not sick.  I'm not that sick.  Bill?  All right.  I want to talk to Bill.  I was just talking to you.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Um, ma'am, Bill's dead.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  How did it happen?  Give my condolences to the children.  I have no clue what you're talking about.  I'm talking about you telling that old woman that her friend Bill was dead when he, in  fact, wasn't.  No idea. 
[00:16:00]  I have no idea.  I just, you know, maybe used the wrong, uh, words, but, you know, I think you know what  I meant.  You basically say that a little, you know, Joan Bonet is hot.  I didn't say that.  I just ate hot.  I heard it.  Rick heard it.  Jennifer heard it.  Everyone's coming in here.  What?  With the look of, with the look of far on, on their faces.  What parent dresses a kid up like that?  With a little cowboy suit.  I mean, the Olsen, now the Olsen twins, they're hot.  But Joan Bonet, Ramsey, come on. 
[00:16:30]  The Olsen twins.  Have you seen them lately?  At least they dress like women.  Oh, my God.  This is turning into the, the inappropriate show.  I saw them on TV this weekend, the Olsen twins.  Yeah.  They're getting little boobies now.  Oh, they got the little African boobies happening?  African boobies?  What are you talking about?  Well, all right.  I'll explain myself.  This is just taking turns for the worse in every corner.  Well, you remember National Geographic when we were growing up? 
[00:17:00]  Yes.  And now on, I don't know, what, like the Discovery Channel and stuff, they show the African tribes  and you get to see little prepubescent boobies.  And not that it turns, not that it turns me on or anything, but it's just really funny because  they're little like knobs, like, look, like this.  Okay.  Yeah.  This is radio, Olby.  No one sees you squishing your nip until it pops through your shirt.  That's what they look like, though.  Look.  It's like a Dixie cup.  Yeah. 
[00:17:30]  Exactly.  What?  You've never seen that look?  Yeah, I see.  I saw a lot of this this weekend because, you know, the families were all out getting their  ice cream and stuff.  Right, right.  And it's like, parents, put the bras on your little girls.  They got the little knobs, little knobs like this.  And it's like, it's embarrassing for the kid and it's embarrassing for everyone taking a  look at it.  So.  Oh.  Where the hell did this go? 
[00:18:00]  Oh.  Now, I'm sorry I ever brought that up.  But the Olsen twins are, what, we're five years away from happening?  Five years and counting.  Before we could have a legal threesome, so.  All right.  We better get the hell out of this.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York.  Dave Matthews, Van and Crush.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Big congratulations going to all our Aerosmith ticket winners from this past weekend.  And especially to Mike Moran of Paramus, New Jersey, who is the winner of the Joe Perry  private guitar lesson and Gibson guitar. 
[00:18:30]  He's going to love that.  He called us earlier and said, dude, you got to congratulate me on the radio.  They're all waiting at the shop.  Well, he better be good.  What do you mean?  For his sake.  It'd be kind of embarrassing, huh?  For him.  You know, if he can't play at all.  Well, do you think Joe Perry's going to sit there for four hours and teach a guy guitar?  Or is he going to just hang and talk to him a little bit and show him a couple chords?  He's got to teach him.  You know, he's got to teach him something.  I just hope the guy knows how to, at least, you know, what end of a guitar is up. 
[00:19:00]  I think most people would appreciate if Joe Perry taught him how to play Smoke on the Water.  I'm serious.  That's the only song I learned on the guitar.  Then I realized music wasn't for me.  Yeah.  So.  Good luck to you.  Well, I guess we've got to, you know, do the birthday list for today, Anthony.  Uh-oh.  Not the birthday list.  Well, I hate when other shows do this.  Yeah.  But there is someone here that you love, so we'll do it for that reason alone. 
[00:19:30]  Harry Chapin's birthday today.  He would have been 56 years old.  That's it.  Let's see who else.  Larry Berg, 42 years old today.  Johnny Bench, 51 years old today.  Eli Wallach.  Is he still alive?  No, he just recently died.  He did, right?  Yeah.  Best role for Eli Wallach ever, ever, ever.  The first Creepshow.  Stephen King's movie.  He was the guy that, bugs.  I hate him.  Bugs.  Yeah. 
[00:20:00]  That was Eli?  Yeah.  Mr. Pratt, what's the matter?  Bugs got your tongue?  God, I love that movie.  Yes.  He would have been 83 today.  And Ted Knight would have been.  Oh, how old?  75 only.  That's it?  He looked 75 when he died.  He died, what, four or five years ago now?  Mm-hmm.  I think longer than that.  Here it comes.  This is the whole reason why I did this.  Sit down, Danny. 
[00:20:30]  Mm-hmm.  How about a fresca?  Oh, Lou, Lou, Mary, Murr.  Oh, Lou, Lou, Mary, Murr.  He does this for 10 minutes, but I won't be able to stop him.  Look, I'll try.  It's easy to grin when your ship comes in and you've got the stock market beat.  But the man that's worthwhile is the man that can smile when his shorts are too tight in the seat.  Okay, Pookie, get in the boat. 
[00:21:00]  Ted Knight, 75 years old today if he was still alive.  Well, that's all you're going to do today.  Lou, Lou, Lou, please Lou, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Murr, Murr, Murr.  Yeah, there was a Murray and a Mary.  Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary.  Lou, Lou, Lou, Lou, Lou, Lou, Lou, Lou. 
[00:21:30]  Mary.  We got to tell the story when you did that to, who was it, Charles Osgood?  Charles Osgood.  Yeah, we were.  Anthony and I, we were presenters at this stupid radio awards thing up in Boston.  Yeah.  We hate awards, can't stand them, but we had to make it look good.  So we went.  It was early in our career up there and we felt like we had to do it.  Yeah. 
[00:22:00]  And it was just a bunch of pompous jack-offs sitting out there.  It was just a mess.  Mess.  That was before we became bitter.  Yeah.  Yeah, the week before.  Yeah.  Before we became bitter and sarcastic, we went to this awards thing in Boston.  And Charles Osgood was the master of ceremonies.  And he introduces us and we come on stage.  I went, thank you, Mr. Cronkite.  It's an honor to meet you.  Lou, Lou, Mary, Murr.  Talk about the proverbial deer caught in the headlights. 
[00:22:30]  He's just looking at me like, what does it even mean?  I think he was thinking in his head, but I'm not Waldo Cronkite.  Didn't even get the joke.  Everyone else is laughing their asses off.  It all started for me at a small 5,000 watt radio station in Fresno, California.  Lou, Lou, Lou.  Mary, Mary, Murr.  Murr.  Murr.  Mary, Lou, Lou. 
[00:23:00]  Dude, can you do one more Caddyshack?  Any line from Caddyshack?  You did the palm.  Yeah.  What else?  You did the Danny.  You know, Dr. Beeper's been club champion three years running and I'm no slouch myself.  Lou.  Caddyshack is one of those movies when you see it on TV.  You could be in the middle of a Jets football game, a Giants football game.  You could be on your way out.  You have somewhere to go.  But if that movie's on TV, you got to sit and watch at least one or two scenes. 
[00:23:30]  If I see one more gopher on this golf course, I'll be looking for a new greenskeeper.  Is that clear?  Well, I'm enjoying it.  Okay.  All right.  What do we got here?  Mary.  Some Johnny Lang on the way?  Are you done?  I'm getting so done.  Okay.  Line three.  All right.  Oh.  Take a phone call.  Hello.  You're on the air.  Will you please stop that stupid Ted Knight imitation? 
[00:24:00]  Well, what's the matter with you?  You don't appreciate a fine broadcaster?  Yes.  Hello.  Lou.  Is this Lou?  Why do you do that so well?  Is this Mary, Murr, or Lou?  Lou.  Oh, got it.

[00:30:30]  Walking in space right now.  Oh, the space station.  Yes.  Can I tell you something  About the space station  Really fast?  Yeah.  I think it was Friday.  This past Friday,  The space shuttle took off.  Mm-hmm.  No one cared.  No one cared.  Because John Glenn wasn't on it.  No one cared.  Can you believe this?  The space shuttle Endeavor  Is up there delivering  Another piece  To this international space station  We're building.  Remember that thing?  Remember that thing  We were supposed to have  Built already by 1999? 
[00:31:00]  And there's supposed to be  Rocket cars  And we're all flying up to it.  Yeah.  And on our way to the moon.  You know,  When I was watching  The Jetsons growing up,  I was convinced  By the time I got in my 30s,  I'd have a Jetsons car.  Oh, Jamie!  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then what happened?  It's the same cars.  It's the same cars,  The same everything.  They're building,  They're putting together  This space station.  You know what it looks like?  Huh?  Skylab.  Remember that from the 70s?  Yeah.  What happened?  I don't know.  What happened?  We were supposed to be  So far ahead by 1999. 
[00:31:30]  Now,  Wasn't Skylab the thing  That fell back to Earth?  Yeah.  That was the one, right?  Yeah.  I remember being a caddy  At the Huntington Crescent Club.  Yeah.  And I had a caddy  The day that it was supposed to,  You know,  Hit Earth.  Swear to God,  I was so paranoid  That it was going to fall on you.  Am I going to be the one  That it hits?  Yeah,  It looks like Skylab.  And it's 1999.  Remember that show  Space 1999?  Vaguely.  It was supposed to be,  We were supposed to be flying around  In all kinds of cool spaceships  And bases on the moon.  And now we're just putting 
[00:32:00]  This thing together.  But they're up there  Doing this  And no one hears about it.  You heard about  John Glenn's sleep study.  That real important thing.  Yeah.  Those guys right now  Risking their lives right now  Putting handrails  On these pieces of spaceship  And plugging in connectors.  And they're on a,  Like a tether, right?  Yeah,  One guy kind of rides  On the robot arm.  Uh-huh.  They strap his feet on  And they push him out there  And he does his work.  Another guy  Has a tether  That is in the cargo bay 
[00:32:30]  In the space shuttle  And he's going to test out  Saturday  An emergency jet  Backpack rescue system.  Oh, man.  Whoa.  Wow.  So I guess if the thing breaks  You won't, you know,  Go flying off.  Oh, dear.  Whoa.  I'm lost in space.  Help me.  Help me,  You bubble-headed boobie.  Grab a hold of my leg.  Quickly.  You clattering clunk  Of colligionous junk.  Oh, dear. 
[00:33:00]  Look,  I'm further from the ship  Than ever.  Whoa.  Will I ever feel  The supple smoothness  Of young William's  Buttocks again?  Whoa.  I'm a pedophile  Lost in space.  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  Now, what do you mean  By a pedophile  Lost in space?  What?  You don't remember  That show?  I remember the show.  You don't remember  Dr. Smith  Constantly grabbing 
[00:33:30]  Young William.  He was always like  If a monster would come around  He'd grab Will  And put him in front of him.  Hit me!  Lou!  He'd be massaging  His shoulders.  He would always  Hang out with them.  There were other people  To hang out with  On lost in space.  Who else was he  Going to hang out with?  Judy?  No,  What's his name?  Major West.  Smith!  Smith!  Smith,  What have you done  With the hundred  Modern garden?  He could have  Hung out with Penny.  At least she was a girl. 
[00:34:00]  Yes.  But no,  He chose  Young William.  Yes,  Dear boy.  Dear boy.  Come here.  Come here,  Dear boy.  Woo!  So you think  He was a pedophile?  Well,  Look at him.
