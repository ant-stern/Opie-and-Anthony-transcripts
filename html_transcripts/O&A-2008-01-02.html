<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts recounting their respective vacations. Opie detailed a trip to Grand Junction, Colorado, where he experienced unexpectedly harsh weather, reached 118 mph in a rented Chrysler 300 (after failing to secure a Porsche), and hilariously got the car stuck sideways in a hotel parking lot following a night of drinking.  Anthony described his Christmas in Philadelphia and his recent LASIK surgery, alongside an embarrassing early arrival at an Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne Christmas party at Madison Square Garden.

A substantial portion of the show centered on a comedic dissection of Dick Clark's New Year's Eve broadcast.  Opie and Anthony repeatedly played clips highlighting Clark's perceived mental decline, making numerous crude jokes about his age and health, misinterpreting his lines ("Due Year" instead of "New Year"), and speculating on off-camera assistance ("They poke him with sticks").  They also discussed their own New Year's Eve celebrations, including Jim Norton's show, and mentioned a new Opie and Anthony animation on iTunes. Other topics included the Patriots' undefeated season, a stolen GPS device, the excessive confetti at the Times Square New Year's Eve celebration, and the overuse of the word "green" in environmental discussions.  Studio guest Roland performed a rendition of Ave Maria.

The show then transitioned to a discussion of New Year's resolutions, sparked by a website list.  This led to personal anecdotes, including one host's insistence on being called "Gregaudio" and another's bathroom scream therapy session.  Their pet peeves emerged, particularly one host's hatred of fur coats, prompting a conversation about wealth and human nature. A caller shared a similar aversion to fur coats, particularly on women.  News items covered included a window washer's fall (resulting in one death), the arrest of former guest Jim Lirtz for vehicular homicide (DUI), and a large settlement from a "Big Dig" lawsuit.  The hosts also joked about media bias in reporting different types of accidents and played a humorous clip of a news anchor struggling with a suggestive question. A running joke about network censorship preventing discussion of Asian culture persisted.


The next segment involved a discussion of an online game, focusing on a teammate's poor performance and using homophobic slurs to describe their opponents.  This was followed by an interview with Richard Huff, a TV columnist for the Daily News, about the writers' strike and its impact on late-night television, including Letterman and Leno's decisions to return to air without writers.  The discussion included the fairness of writers' union contracts and the impact of new media. Other segments touched upon a tiger sighting in San Francisco, upcoming engagements of show associates (details withheld), a staff member's funeral, listener mail, and Anthony's graphic account of a painful urination problem after excessive water and alcohol consumption.  The hosts also mentioned upcoming segments featuring "the mad scientist and Epstein" and the "Coke Logic" animated podcast.

The show then covered frustrations with on-demand movie rentals, particularly the lack of Christmas movies, followed by a review of *Spider-Man 3*, criticizing Tobey Maguire's performance and the film's depiction of the "emo" movement. They also discussed having Thomas Haden Church as a guest.  The hosts detailed their Christmas gifts: Opie received DVDs (Taxi, Nirvana and Alice in Chains Unplugged), a Ken Burns documentary, clothes, and a nose trimmer; Anthony received a canceled check signed by Pete Maravich and a Nazi-marked 1938 German Mauser rifle.  This led to a discussion of WWII memorabilia. A significant portion focused on an "Afro Wars" competition between Opie and Anthony's staff and the Ron and Fez show, and the debut of "The Mad Scientist and Epstein."  A "Biggest Gainer" weight-gain contest was announced, with E-Rock's weight revealed.  Crude and offensive language, including sexually explicit and racially charged comments, was frequent.

A segment featuring graphic audio descriptions of female breasts followed, with the hosts using vulgar language and sexual innuendos.  Listener "Pat from Manaki" called in, referencing "double-stuffed Oreos."  The hosts discussed various terms for breast shapes, including vulgar ones.  A phone message from Doug Stanhope described him and his companions as intoxicated and listening to Dave Matthews Band, mentioning psychedelic drug use.  A significant discussion about Lynette "Squeaky" Fromme and her assassination attempt on President Ford, filled with offensive and insensitive comments, ensued.  The show concluded with a listener's birthday message and a raucous, nonsensical sign-off including a brief burst of a song about masturbation. Jim Norton was a guest in the studio during this segment and participated in the discussions and comedic banter.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony's striking again.  I sat with some of the greatest gangsters in the world.  Gun Body, Zam Gervonno.  And I went in and said, John, you ever f*** with me again?  This is Opie. You hear that sound?  Opie and Anthony.  I was amazed Guns N' Roses was starting to blow up and you didn't have guitars to play 
[00:01:00]  because you were pointing them off to get some dope.  Yeah, I was a big fan of the age.  Big fan.  Opie and Anthony.  This country went off the cliff and it's just in free fall.  It's just a sick, sick, it's disgusting my voice you hear.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  You know, I think we, oh, this is going to, what the, you hear that? 
[00:01:30]  Nice and muffly.  Hold on, what the?  Ah, thank you.  Is that better?  They probably didn't hear that out there in Radio Land.  Turn that up, there we go.  It sounds very basic.  What changes between the last time we did a live show and now?  Our ears.  Who the F comes in here and fiddles for like 10 straight days?  Opie and Anthony are here, so aren't here, so it's time to just start fiddling. 
[00:02:00]  It's the people that didn't get vacation.  Oh.  They come in here and fiddle.  Stupid music jocks.  They had to work.  Ouch.  Actually, I met a bunch of those guys here in New York and they're very nice people.  Hello.  Hello.  Yes, we are live.  Yeah.  It is 2008.  So they say.  Yeah.  And we're back from our vacation. 
[00:02:30]  I think we should start the new year with Roland singing.  Ooh.  Ava Maria.  Let's get everyone in the mood for the new year here with Opie and Anthony.  Here's Roland.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Let's get everyone in the mood for the new year. 
[00:03:00]  Maria, gratia plenia. Maria, gratia plenia. Ave, ave, dominus. Dominus tecum benita tu inmoversia. 
[00:03:30]  Et tu benedicia. Et tu fructus ventris, ventris de Jesus. Ave Maria. Ave Maria. 
[00:04:00]  Mata de ora por nobis. Petrobius.  Ora por nobis ora. Ora por nobis petrobius.  Ave Maria.  Nuc et in hora mortris. 
[00:04:30]  Et in hora mortris nos tra. Et in hora mortris.  Ave Maria.  Yeah. Yeah. Oh, my God. Oh, wow. You think he'll get an 11-minute standing ovation? Bravo. Bravo. Bravo. 
[00:05:00]  Bravo. El Fatso. El Fatso. And that's how we start. All right. Good morning. It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Yes. Like Anthony said a few minutes ago, we are live. Finally. First time in, I don't know, like 10 days or something like that. 
[00:05:30]  Is that how long it was?  I believe so. Jesus. Wow. I believe so. So how was your holiday? I guess that's the way we start.  Oh, well, wonderful. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know, I went out to Colorado. Colorado. Grand Junction.  They're in Grand Junction where you have to take two planes because two planes are always better than one when you're going somewhere.  I had to stop in Denver and take a little propeller plane. Yeah. It's 2008 now. And propeller planes. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah. Got there and then was informed. Hey, by the way, it's, you know, the coldest and most precipitation that Grand Junction's seen like ever.  Really? Hey, thanks. Well, if you're going to go out there, you might as well, you know.  Yeah. See it when history is being made. Right. And you know me. You don't want to be out there when it's balmy.  I hate the cold and I'm not a big fan of snow or anything like that. It is ridiculous. But then everybody's trying to tell me, but it's a dry cold. 
[00:06:30]  It's a different kind of cold than New York cold. I went, OK, pulled out the old iPhone.  I hit my weather little icon and I have in there Grand Junction and I have New York and I go, OK, let me check out Grand Junction cold.  It's nine. It's nine degrees. A comfortable nine. Nine because it's dry. A dry nine. 
[00:07:00]  Let me look at New York. Oh, it's 52 degrees. I don't care how wet it is when it's 52 wet degrees and nine very dry degrees.  I'd rather be in the wet 52 degrees. You're going to pick wet over dry.  Wet. Who wouldn't? Give me wet.  Who wouldn't pick wet over dry? You know what I mean?  Of course. Huddle, huddle.  So that was just a treat.  Yeah.  And then I got into some shenanigans that I'm sure I'll be chastised for because I was being a little irresponsible a couple of times out there. 
[00:07:30]  What? Really?  A little.  You?  Well, we went through this whole thing before, you know, I got a hotel room out there so I could get away and enjoy like some of my vacation where it's not that I'm being woken up very early in the morning by the kids, by Melinda's sister's children and my buddy, buddy, his kids.  Of course, you know, they're kids gonna be loud. So I got a hotel room, which I spent a few days in not a hotel for for both of you, a hotel for you. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, because, well, my girlfriend wanted to stay with the kids and everything.  But she, you know, she likes that.  No, because that's a normal thing to do, especially around Christmas.  Well, for a week, it's not. See, I stayed there on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.  Oh, you threw the little fellas a bone, did you?  Oh, wow. Look, everybody.  Look. 
[00:08:30]  Look.  No.  Uncle Anthony is gonna throw us a bone.  Boy, what a lucky, lucky day for those fellas.  But it's vacation for me, too, so I need to relax a little bit.  Was there an excitement in the house when they had made the announcement?  Kids, Uncle Anthony's gonna stay the night.  Yay!  Yay!  Oh, when I'd come in the door after being in the hotel.  Drunk, probably.  You know, reeking of booze and hungover.  They didn't cheer. They all covered up their bottoms and cried. 
[00:09:00]  Not Uncle Anthony.  Why does he smell like booze?  And I had a rental car.  You know I wanted to get a Porsche or something nice.  I do believe I saw a couple of your YouTube videos.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's a couple of YouTube videos up there.  Just some quick clips I popped up.  But I wanted to get something nice.  And I wound up getting stuck with a Chrysler 300.  A lot of people go, oh, that sounds okay.  That's not that bad.  It's got some juice to it.  No, it didn't. 
[00:09:30]  Well, the problem was when we left for vacation, you were gonna rent a...  I wanted some kind of nice Porsche or something.  You were gonna go all out.  Yeah, yeah.  Just gonna get like a sports car or something.  I could really have some fun in.  I guess they were all sold out.  They were all rented?  In Grand Junction, you ain't getting nothing.  Oh.  You're getting that or a minivan.  Right.  So I took the Chrysler and...  Well, I broke it.  I kind of broke it.  Yeah?  Yeah, this is after I tried to see how fast it would go on video. 
[00:10:00]  Well, that's the video I saw on YouTube.  And you were really pissed off when, what, the car tapped out at 120?  It was like 118.  118.  Or something like that.  And it was just like, the Speedo goes up to 140.  And I was really annoyed that the car I had...  And it took forever to get there.  I was just like, okay, look.  Hey.  Look to you, Jimmy.  He's even filming himself.  And...  So not only is he going 118 in a rental, and he would have went faster if it didn't tap  out at 118.  He's actually holding the camera with one hand. 
[00:10:30]  That's a very little camera.  And looking into the camera as he's going over 100 miles an hour in Grand Junction, uh...  What are you doing?  Colorado.  Oh, I wanted to see how fast it would go.  I understand that.  See, look.  It barely...  It takes forever to get from like 80 to 90 to 100, 110.  And then it just...  It doesn't go any further than like 116, 17, 18.  What are you doing?  I was driving the rental car.  You got to see what it can do before you then drive it for the rest of the week. 
[00:11:00]  You got to know its capabilities.  See, look.  The Speedo goes up to 140.  And it just stopped right there.  It stopped at 118.  It annoyed me.  You're going to die.  No.  Everyone's going to die.  We're going to die sometime, right?  At some point.  So, uh...  You know, then I took it out.  And this...  Okay.  This could have been a little irresponsible.  There was, um...  I think a lot of drinking involved one evening. 
[00:11:30]  What?  Really?  Yeah.  Is it my job to act surprised?  Huh?  Huh?  You had a few?  And the house to the hotel was very close.  So, I knew I could make it.  Yeah.  You know, so, um...  You told me, I think, uh...  Over the weekend, three quarters of a mile?  Yeah.  It's nothing.  I think that's important to the story.  Yeah.  Because most people would think, well, of course something could happen between the house and the hotel.  It's a 10, 20 minute ride.  No, no.  It was very close.  It was less than two minutes. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  It's less than two minutes.  But it was snowing real bad.  But I was driving very slow.  I wasn't going to speed in that condition.  80?  No, no, no.  Really, like 15 miles an hour.  It was like a blizzard.  It was really bad snow.  Okay.  So, I was driving very slow because I was seeing maybe two of everything also.  So, you know, you don't want to...  Maybe it wasn't snowing that hard.  I just saw twice the snowflakes.  And when I got into the hotel parking lot, I assumed I had parked, went into the hotel, gone to sleep, woke up. 
[00:12:30]  And then I go out to my car in the morning or the afternoon because I had to sleep it off a little bit.  And I see a Chrysler 300.  I open the door.  It's not mine.  But it's parked where I was parking.  So, I quickly shut the door and look around like, uh-oh, I hope no one saw me thinking I'm trying to steal the car.  Now, mystery number two, where is my Chrysler 300?  I look around the lot. 
[00:13:00]  I can't really find it.  So, I hit the key chain and I hear a faint beep, beep, beep.  So, I go, oh, okay.  And I noticed the hotel wasn't booked up.  So, it wasn't like there was a lack of spots.  But I'm in the middle of the parking lot.  Please tell me.  All right.  I was going to say, please tell me the beep was coming from the woods.  The roof.  Or just a pair of like four wheels upside down spinning.  Put some little patent leather shoes on the grill. 
[00:13:30]  Or from like a frozen pond.  So, I hear it and I go around the row of cars that are there and I see my car and I'm diagonal on top of the yellow lines that separate the parking spots.  And I look and the first thing I say to myself is, my God, you didn't even try, did you?  You didn't even try. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, you were sideways to the parking spot.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, pretty much sideways.  So, I drive to the house.  Everything's cool.  You know, I'm like, oh, yeah, I must have parked funny last night.  Then I start.  See, that's normal thinking for Anthony.  I start remembering things.  And I'm like, was I, did I, was, did I.  So, I took out my little camcorder that I carry with me now and, you know, just tape stuff.  And with a little bit of dread, I hit play. 
[00:14:30]  And it starts playing me.  And now it's cool because it's like a movie.  I don't know how it's going to end.  It's me in the car doing donuts in the parking lot of the hotel.  Okay.  Huge parking lot.  Just doing ridiculous donuts.  By yourself.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And just laughing like an idiot.  I have to get this online.  I got to ask. 
[00:15:00]  Laughing like an idiot.  I do have to ask you.  Do you realize that you're going insane?  I don't know.  I might be.  But I always wondered if the person that is going insane actually knows they're going insane.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're in your life like Memento.  Yeah.  You're like watching it on video instead of reading it off tattoos on your face.  It was very odd.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was kind of odd to watch the video and go, oh, this gentleman seems like he's having some fun.  And then, oh, that's me.  So, it was video of you doing donuts. 
[00:15:30]  Doing donuts.  And apparently I was cutting the wheel very hard.  And really tacking out the engine up to maybe 7,000.  Well, if you're going to do donuts, that's the way to do it.  You got to because it's really.  You can't do it half-assed.  There are some light poles in there and other stuff that, watching the video, I came very close to.  But I noticed on the drive over to the house after this was all done that the power steering pump was making some noises. 
[00:16:00]  And finally decided to give up the ghost.  I broke the power steering pump and had no power steering for the last two days that I had the rental car.  But I took the insurance out.  So, you know, I could have driven the thing through the window.  Yeah.  You might have for all you know.  You got to see the rest of the video.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was like, I'm very surprised at that.  You never catch things like that on video. 
[00:16:30]  You know?  You usually just, they slowly come back and you go, oh, yeah.  I remember kind of doing donuts.  But watching the video and just laughing.  Ha, ha, ha.  This is great.  Uh, I was going to give it to someone else.  But unfortunately, Doug B. has a good line.  Some guy wanted to be the first instant feedback of 08.  Sorry, dude, from Columbus.  But I have to go with Doug B.  Salt Lake City.  First instant feedback of 08.  Hey, guys.  I hope you don't mind.  But I just called 911 and had an ambulance sent to Super Agent Bob Eatman's house.  Because I'm sure he's having a heart attack as he's listening to this. 
[00:17:00]  No.  Everything was well in hand.  It's not good if you have to push play on a video camera to see what you did the night before.  Review on video?  Yeah.  It was the holidays.  We were on vacation.  That's very disturbing.  But it's also disturbing that you were doing 120 totally sober.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You would think that would be something I would do drunk.  Yeah.  But he only did 120 because that's how he would have went all the way to the end. 
[00:17:30]  I went to 140.  I'm not calling him a pussy.  Thank you.  All right.  Because that's what I called the car.  I was yelling at the car.  And, yeah, that was just a couple of little highlights.  Most of the other stuff was family-oriented, you know, things like that.  I don't have any great stories from the break, really.  Just a nice Christmas in Philly with the Philly crew.  Christmas in Philly. 
[00:18:00]  How was that?  It's good.  Yeah?  Yeah, we had a good time, man.  Depends on what part you're in.  I don't have any stories.  No.  Not really, no.  Did you cut any gassers at bad times?  No, I kept that under control.  Why?  That would have been great.  I figured out the cause of the gassers, by the way, over break.  Oh, yeah?  It's a Kashi cereal.  It's like a cinnamon.  It's a cinnamon, like, what's that one with the-  Doody?  What's the square cereal?  Like shredded wheat?  Yeah. 
[00:18:30]  Kashi makes one with, like, it's, like, flavored with cinnamon.  Sounds lovely.  Oh, boy.  Is that a-  That's what's causing the awful gass.  Yeah, the problems.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, I don't have any stories.  It was a very relaxing, got a lot of sleep type of break.  Well, I had a very nice break, starting with the-  After we left, I went and got LASIK surgery, which is-  Yes.  I will eventually go over the entire process.  It's going very well.  Good.  I'm going to say that the day after LASIK, I was ready to go see Ozzy at the garden. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, I got your voicemail.  Oh, did you actually have that?  I think so.  See if you have it, because-  Go ahead, talk.  I'll try to find it.  I wanted to go and see.  I'm like, well, can we get backstage as if possible?  So, I called my agent, and he actually contacted Sharon Osbourne's production and got us badges  to go backstage.  There was a Christmas party, a VIP Christmas party that Ozzy and Sharon were hosting guests.  You? 
[00:19:30]  Uh, yeah.  Oh, what a best Christmas ever for a young boy.  But, uh, I left open message because I was so embarrassed.  I'll just tell you what happened.  We got there at the garden.  We got there so early.  I got it.  I got it.  I don't know if he'll listen to this.  Hold on.  It should play.  Can't hear it.  Yeah, it's going to be too loud.  How do we do this?  I'll give it to somebody.  We'll figure it out.  But, anyway.  I went, sorry. 
[00:20:00]  That's okay.  We got to the garden really early, and we were walking around.  It was really embarrassing because there was nobody there yet, and, like, they hadn't  even, like, opened the doors.  We had these laminates, which allowed us to go everywhere.  And there was this VIP Christmas party before the show, and my girlfriend and I got there.  We got there while they were setting up the Christmas party.  Like, some guy, there was, like, a bunch of people, like, just kind of putting things  together.  And there's a guy, like, with a Santa pants on and the Santa jacket not even on.  He's like, what are you, what are you doing?  I'm like, oh, we're here for the party?  He's like, who are you here to see?  I'm like, Ozzy and Sharon? 
[00:20:30]  Dude, that doesn't start until, then we were, like, 35 minutes early.  Oh.  So we kind of get.  Over-eager little guy.  Oh, I do.  We actually walked into this stairwell and just stood in this stairwell at Madison Square  Garden and looked out, like, where the elevators go, and looked out at traffic and hopefully  we didn't get thrown out.  It was really embarrassing.  We didn't get to.  That's the message I got because he's like, they're still setting up.  I'm such an idiot.  I'm here early.  I feel like such an idiot.  We're over-eager little guys.  Yeah, they're still bringing in the wreaths.  Yeah, the holiday wreaths. 
[00:21:00]  Smashing me.  Yeah.  For a good hand.  And well, she should have.  Yeah.  All right.  You're like the little kid that can't sleep on Christmas morning.  Exactly what it was like.  The guy was, I'll never forget, what are you here for?  I'm like, Ozzy and Sharon?  Almost 40.  Hey, we're going to take our first break.  When we get back, we celebrated New Year's Eve at Jim Norton's Fine Show.  Yeah.  At the North Fork Theater.  Great time.  And then at FH Riley's in Huntington.  A big hi to everyone that went down there.  We missed Dick Clark. 
[00:21:30]  Bring it in 2008.  We got the audio.  Oh, my God.  Gotta hear that.  Is he still doing it?  Oh, my God.  I hear after three of these, he's cured.  Yeah.  That's what I heard.  Wow.  And also, we got an update on the window washer that fell 500 feet.  Oh.  And we got to talk about the tiger mauling that dude in San Francisco.  One of the greatest stories.  Few people.  Few people, right.  Killed one.  But we'll get into that after the break.  Also, a quickie for the faithful out there.  Is it true?  The guy on the scalpel that fell, he fell out of bed, the hospital bed, and died. 
[00:22:00]  What irony.  For the faithful, we got a new animation up on iTunes.  We're doing a thing with iTunes.  It's a free download.  We're not trying to get you to do anything, really.  But the new animation by, I believe it's Coke Logic still, right?  Is Patrice Sleeps at Rest Area.  One of our favorite Opie and Anthony bits.  It's now animated.  It's up on iTunes.  So check it out.  The animation's doing very, very well in the podcast section of iTunes.  That's great, Patrice.  Yeah, it's called Creepy Cold Guy. 
[00:22:30]  So check it out for yourself as we go to break here.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, good morning to everybody.  Happy New Year.  Make sure you don't write 07 on your checks today.  How many times does that happen?  Did you make a New Year's resolution?  Did you?  I don't think I did.  Anyone else see a lot of hungover people trying to jog yesterday?  No.  While you were driving around?  Ugh. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, you had to be on the lookout for that.  These people starting their New Year's resolution.  Oh.  Even though they only had a couple hours sleep and they were still hungover.  But they're like, made that resolution.  Got to start off strong.  Got to start today.  Oh, just bleh.  Oh, yeah.  Poofing on the side of the road.  What's up, Thane?  I also saw a lot of people walking, a lot of women walking around in gowns at one in the afternoon.  I know.  Shame.  That's a lot of shame.  It's Hopi.  It's Anthony.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  A lot of people are trying to figure out where to find the video of Anthony going only 118 miles in the rental. 
[00:23:30]  He would have, if you're just tuning in, he would have done 140, but it only went to 118.  Yeah.  Before the car pretty much shut down a little bit.  So that video and all the videos we talk about on this radio show will be up on onaradio.com.  It's an easy place to go to get all the video links that we talk about on the show.  And you get Stephen S. from Bayshore's Fine Rundown.  Yes.  Although he's a lurking creep.  Oh, at FH Riley's? 
[00:24:00]  He's a lurking creep.  He's too scared to come up and say hi.  He was like Zelig.  He basically works for the show at this point, and he's too scared to say hi to anybody.  He's been around for six years.  Come up and say hi, will ya?  He just doesn't want to make any trouble.  No kidding.  That's what it is.  Everywhere you look, though, you see a hot girl, and you see this awful big head with mutton chops pop up behind you.  What is that?  That's Steve.  Jimmy had me laughing so hard at FH Riley's, and I think I had Jimmy laughing as well.  I think we were kind of secretly competing with each other for big laughs, which is tough, because Jimmy's the king. 
[00:24:30]  We were sitting there at the table.  My girlfriend actually reminded me of this last night, and her and Marina were across from me and Ope, the comedian who opened up at...  Marina Franklin.  Very funny, yeah.  She's very, very funny.  I liked a lot of her new stuff at your gig on Saturday.  Yeah, she's great.  Or Sunday, or whatever New Year's was.  Monday, whatever, yeah.  So the four were sitting at the table, and it's kind of loud, and people keep coming up and just yapping, which was fine. 
[00:25:00]  I mean, we didn't mind, though.  Everybody's really nice.  Look, look.  Mr. Nice Guy, no, it wasn't.  Can I...  Well, I didn't, you know...  It wasn't nice.  Well, hold on.  Before you say what I did, I'll tell you why I did it.  Because this girl comes up to Jimmy, and you've got to help me out with this, Jimmy, but I think she basically said, you know, you were hilarious tonight.  Can I have this sign?  Blah, blah, blah.  And said something like, Jimmy, how are you feeling?  Or whatever.  You lost a lot of weight.  Oh, you lost a lot of weight. 
[00:25:30]  So Jimmy proceeds to say...  Well, she's like, you lost a lot of weight.  I'm like, yeah, thanks.  I have stomach cancer.  And she's like, you do?  I'm like, yeah.  And she's like, are you going to be okay?  I'm like, we don't know yet.  Yeah, he goes, I really don't know yet.  I should find out within the next week or two.  And I'm dying.  I'm like, oh, is that funny?  What made it even funnier...  We keep speaking, and she's not like...  She asked me to sign her ticket.  Like, she's like, I have stomach cancer.  She's like, are you going to be okay?  I'm like, well, we don't know yet.  And she goes, oh, could you sign my ticket? 
[00:26:00]  Sorry, sorry.  Because I'm dying of stomach cancer to the table.  Sign your ticket.  And then she just...  She showed concern for maybe a half a second.  A millisecond.  A millisecond.  And then she started hoping I would die right there so she could get the last autograph  like Mark Chapman.  So as she starts talking, O picks up his noisemaker, and it was really obnoxious because she's yapping  and he's like...  And it sounded like... 
[00:26:30]  And my chick described it to me yesterday.  She's like, it sounded like somebody being killed.  That's what that noisemaker sounded like.  It was an awful noisemaker.  And this girl's mouth would open.  It was like...  I wouldn't do it when Jimmy was talking, only when she tried to talk.  And it literally lasted for three minutes.  Every time she talked...  She didn't acknowledge that I couldn't hear a word she was saying because the equivalent  of an air horn was being blown into a fat face.  And then I proceeded to do it with everybody that came up to try to talk to Jimmy. 
[00:27:00]  And I was making believe I was just celebrating the new year, you know?  Yeah.  I wouldn't blow it right at him.  I'd be a little off to the side, but...  With her, you blew it right at him.  Oh, yeah.  Because she...  I could see the...  Like, it was in my peripheral vision.  I see the end of the noisemaker coming, like, in front of my left eye.  And I just hear...  Basically, I decided when she didn't, like, acknowledge your, quote, stomach cancer that  she doesn't deserve to live.  That was...  Yeah.  I mean, come on.  Or doesn't deserve to talk to you at the very least.  I literally couldn't hear a word she said for three minutes.  It was so funny because she didn't notice. 
[00:27:30]  It's like, how do you not know that?  The four of us were rolling.  And it's like, how do you not notice that not a word you're saying is being heard?  Yeah, there was somebody at our end of the table, a couple, that just wouldn't shut up.  Just wouldn't shut up.  We were trying to just carry on a conversation.  And it was...  Danny was there.  And it was really just them trying to shoehorn their way into the conversation. 
[00:28:00]  Did the guy have a beard?  I don't remember.  I'm just like, you know something?  Yeah, and then Danny got all mad because he's trying to talk to Danny, and Danny's trying  to talk to him, like, just to kind of make him feel better, I guess.  You know, just trying to be nice.  Trying to be nice.  Indulge him in his conversations.  And everything that the guy's saying, and it's just being really...  I don't even know how you would describe what you were doing. 
[00:28:30]  Condescending.  Yeah, you'd ask me a question.  And be like, oh, is that what you think about that?  But he's...  And the guy who's asking the question doesn't even realize that he's doing it, so I'm just  trying to sit there without laughing at his face.  He's ready to laugh at his face.  I'm just like, yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, that's amazing.  Fantastic.  And then I turn my head and just start talking to the people we're with.  I thought you were with that guy.  What?  The guy at the end of the table?  I saw him next to you.  I thought you guys were all together.  No!  I don't know who the hell that was. 
[00:29:00]  His wife just decided to pull up the chair.  They sat down.  He's smart.  He got a free meal because we assumed that he was with the crew.  Oh, God, no.  Oh, is that the guy you were talking about?  There were a few.  Oh, my God.  Never.  Whatever.  Yeah, the guy had no problem.  The table was basically all the way down.  And it would be Ope, Jim, their lady friends, Danny and me, Anthony, this guy.  And believe me, there are plenty of circumstances and situations where I will yap with listeners for hours. 
[00:29:30]  Done it before.  Don't worry about it.  And the signing after your gig, that was nice.  A lot of fun.  A lot of talking.  We had a great time.  But then there are situations where the crew itself, we hadn't seen each other in 10 days.  So we kind of got a lot to talk about.  So could you kindly shut the F up and let us talk, maybe?  Wait, so I was the only one that was dreading seeing you guys for the first time in 10 days? 
[00:30:00]  I thought we all would feel like I was feeling like, oh, God, that was too short.  It was kind of a reminder that the alarm was going to go off early.  That was pretty much it.  I was very happy.  I thought it was nice to see Danny.  It was very nice to see everybody.  Yeah.  It was.  All right.  Hey, I want to acknowledge the Pats going 16-0.  Go, Pats.  Go.  Were they just humoring the Giants at the beginning?  Was that what it was?  Just humoring the Giants?  I'm not a big Giants fan. 
[00:30:30]  I've never liked the Giants.  I hate the Giants.  Most people know I'm more of a Jets fan.  More of a Jets fan.  I'm a Jets fan.  I've never followed the Giants or jumped on their stupid bandwagon.  I'd rather jump on the Pats bandwagon any day.  But the Giants have a pretty good team.  Yeah.  They're going to do all right in the playoffs.  But, you know.  I mean, Brady was bored.  He finally decided in the fourth quarter, all right, let's get this.  All right.  Let's just fix this.  I was rooting against them because dummy me.  We just didn't know.  But I booked a gig in Massachusetts. 
[00:31:00]  I was up in Cowlone Cafe the Saturday night.  I had a show.  So I'm competing with the idiot Patriots going for their 16th straight win.  For a history making.  I didn't realize.  I was like, what are you guys playing on a Saturday night for?  Will you think of the comedians and other entertainers?  So, but I had actually.  Knowing Jimmy, though, he's probably, you know, there were probably a few empty seats and  he's all pissed off.  Like, stupid boss.  I can't believe they won't come out and see me.  You know, there was a weird, nice crowd.  I was surprised there was actually that many people there.  But it was so funny. 
[00:31:30]  You've got to give him a break.  16 and 0.  I mean, the whole city, you know, stayed home to watch that game.  I was rooting against the Patriots.  And I even said this on stage.  Why would you root against the Patriots?  Yeah, why?  I don't know.  You're not a Giants fan.  I don't know.  I hate the Giants.  I don't hate the Patriots.  They've never hurt the Cowboys, really.  I don't dislike even the Patriots.  I just realized I don't want them feeling that good.  That's all it is.  I didn't want Boston fans just feeling wonderful.  Like, because I'm not going to be feeling wonderful.  That's all it was. 
[00:32:00]  It was a selfishness.  I didn't want the Patriot fans feeling something.  I was listening to a little sports radio, and they said if the Pats don't win the Super Bowl,  then the 16 and 0 means nothing.  I so disagree.  I think at this point they don't even have to win the Super Bowl.  16 and 0 is just amazing.  Just amazing in this day and age of sports.  Yeah.  You know, when the Dolphins did it, I mean, you know, you had these guys stay on the same  team for a while.  I mean, the Pats, for the most part, they got their nucleus, obviously. 
[00:32:30]  But this is...  We're in the world of free agency and stuff.  And to go 16 and 0 like that?  And salary caps.  It's kind of hard to keep your team together with salary caps.  It's amazing.  So, yeah.  I mean, it was kind of...  I guess it was historic to see them do it, but I didn't see them.  I was on stage.  By the way, you know...  Thanks for nothing, Patriots.  You know the DirecTV thing we did all season?  Well, Danny and Travis won the football pool, if anyone out there cares.  I personally don't.  I took the Giants in game 63.  If you won, you would have personally cared. 
[00:33:00]  I was...  I didn't even come close.  What's up there, Travis?  Those are good friends at Dish Network.  Oh, I said the other one again.  Great.  Oh, my God.  That's just wonderful.  That's just wonderful.  All right, Dish Network.  And they were so nice to us all year long.  Dish Network, I'm sorry.  Now they're going to pull the money, and you won't get it again.  Dish Network.  If you call the show today, just say Dish Network.  Save the advertising, please.  Football pick sponsored by Dish Network.  See, if I have this in front of me, it's time to get more TV from your TV. 
[00:33:30]  Sign up for Dish Network today.  There you go.  But Danny and Travis won the football pool this year.  And I got to acknowledge and say hi to everybody in Buffalo.  That went to that hockey game yesterday.  Absolutely amazing.  73,000 people saw a hockey game at Rich Stadium yesterday.  No, about 10,000 saw it.  Well, true.  I was telling Anthony, I've been to many, many football games.  I saw the Bills, God, probably 20 times at that stadium easily.  And, you know, when you're sitting up high, it's pretty tough to see the field to begin with. 
[00:34:00]  And now to put a hockey rink in the middle of the football field.  Yeah.  I think it was so cold, they figured they could.  The NHL, they're smart.  They're doing a little marketing, man.  I checked out the game.  It was the Sabres-Penguins playing outdoors with lake effect snow.  They had like a half inch of snow on the ice for an NHL game yesterday.  It's like 1800s hockey or something.  Yeah.  No Zamboni.  And the tickets sold out like that.  Something like 73,000, 75,000 people went and checked out that game yesterday. 
[00:34:30]  Of course.  Pretty cool.  They should do that every year.  It was very exciting to watch.  Do it in Miami, then I'll watch it.  Do it in Miami and try to keep the ice cold.  Anyway.  We got Dick Clark.  Yeah.  See, we were just talking about our New Year's and all, but a lot of people got to see Dick Clark.  We did not, but now we, through the beauty of radio, we get to hear Dick Clark. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, good.  I don't really understand why Dick Clark is still on TV.  I'd still rather watch him than Ryan Seacrest, to be very honest.  Oh, I hate Ryan Seacrest.  I can't, I don't get it.  I don't get either one of them at this point.  He's the next guy in line.  But how, though?  Like, I can't, maybe he's talented.  Right place, right time.  But I don't know one person that likes him.  No, no one likes him, but for some reason, television executives like him.  He's got a good image for that.  He's never in any kind of controversy. 
[00:35:30]  They love that milquetoast crap like that.  We could kind of learn something from him, I think.  Can we?  Exactly.  How to not use your teeth when you're doing certain things.  But, uh, I don't know.  I mean, we're going to make fun of Dick Clark.  We have to make fun of Dick Clark.  I don't understand why he's still on TV.  He had a great career.  Yeah.  And, uh, the people around him obviously don't love him.  No.  They don't love Dick Clark.  Or he's their meal ticket and they keep pushing him out the door going, make us some money, stupid. 
[00:36:00]  But there's no reason why this guy should be on TV anymore.  Yeah.  He's a wreck.  Acknowledge that he had an amazing career.  Look back on his career from time to time.  But to have him actually on live TV, he's making everybody uncomfortable.  It is very nerve-wracking to watch him.  You just, you're all like, uh, oh, is he going to screw this up?  Oh, oh, he said a word.  And it's not even the right word.  And the mainstream media, they're not.  It's horrid.  They're not brave enough to say what they're thinking, too. 
[00:36:30]  They have to use words like, oh, look how courageous he is and this and that and blah, blah, blah.  No, it's awful.  Oh, Dick.  Here's Ryan Seacrest introducing Dick Clark, who is happy to be back.  Ladies and gentlemen, back here in Times Square, once again, Mr. Dick Clark.  Thank you, Ryan.  It's great to be back for another New Year's in New York.  Well, there are about a million people in the Times Square, millions more looking all over the world. 
[00:37:00]  And tonight at midnight, they're going to see a brand new ball come down.  It's going to be great.  So don't you dare go away.  I got to say, though, he does sound better than last year.  Does he?  Yes.  Do we have a comparison?  To me, at least.  Except what he just said.  Better, but this shouldn't be on.  You know how many guys are out there hoping they could get a gig like Dick Clark and they don't get to move up because they insist on keeping Dick Clark on TV? 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  You know?  I guess it fits in perfect because he sounds like he's completely hammered, like everybody that is watching the dumb thing.  But.  Oh, geez.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Well, apparently the 2008 ball was made green.  The lights used a fraction of what was needed to power it.  But I guess everything's green now.  2008 is going to be the year of green. 
[00:38:00]  Green.  Yeah.  It's just another crappy, stupid catchphrase.  So we buy things.  Just stop.  Nothing.  It's not green.  No one's saving anything.  Just stop it.  Green my ass.  Yeah.  We.  We.  You're kind of right, man.  I mean, humans just stink.  It's a new.  We're not going to save anything.  It's a marketing ploy.  Nothing's going to be saved.  Everyone, if they, you put your plaster green in front of it and people will be like, oh, this is great. 
[00:38:30]  I'm helping something.  I'm saving money.  I'm doing this.  It's nothing.  You're not doing anything.  Look at China.  It's an entire huge country that is just pumping 1800s technology, coal smoke into the atmosphere.  And we don't even know how.  This is going to happen when once a year they use a little less electricity on a ball that drops in Times Square for F's sake.  There's enough lights all year lighting up Times Square.  Can I tell you, you know, you make a great point for the people that are all over the country. 
[00:39:00]  I'm lucky enough to live in an apartment where I can actually see Midtown Manhattan when I go to bed.  I think green.  Dude, it looks like it's still daylight.  Of course.  It's so funny you just said that.  And when the clouds are low over Manhattan.  Oh, the haze.  It lights up.  Well, the lights from Times Square kind of like hit the ceiling that is the clouds.  And it is amazing how bright that area is in the middle of the night. 
[00:39:30]  You're right.  They're not saving any energy.  But that crystal ball that falls once a year.  Right.  You could light that thing up with those huge lights.  What are they called?  Klieg lights?  The things they use on the movie premieres and stuff.  You could light them up with that once a year.  It isn't going to make a dent.  And they don't turn off the lights, by the way.  No.  In Midtown.  No.  There's just thousands and thousands and thousands, and I'll keep going, thousands of 
[00:40:00]  office buildings that are just illuminated as I'm trying to sleep.  Lit up all night long.  As I'm trying to sleep.  And when I wake up at 4.15 in the morning, they're already all lit.  No one's in those buildings.  Everything's left on.  Everything's left on.  Everything's left on.  They're not trying to save anything.  Green.  Just stop with the green thing.  We make a futile attempt because we feel a little guilty as humans.  Just a little guilt.  Stop.  Don't feel guilty about anything in your life.  Jesus. 
[00:40:30]  You're absolutely true, and I think t-shirts need to be made.  We're not saving anything.  We're not saving anything.  Not ourselves.  Not the world.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Tick, tock, tick, tock.  It's all just ticking to everyone's demise.  We're not saving the rainforest.  We're not saving the exotic animals that are heading toward extinction.  Because the problem is China.  You've got to get China on board, and then maybe we can maybe save a few things here and there.  Is this true?  What? 
[00:41:00]  What?  The ball this year used the power of only ten toasters.  Are they using that as some kind of a selling point?  I thought it looked a little cheap and cheesy this year.  There was one little green band around it that kind of moved.  And then the ball went, you know, dropped.  Yeah, it's like if you're going to do the Times Square ball, use a bunch of toasters.  Right.  It's once.  What the hell?  It's not.  You know what green is? 
[00:41:30]  You know what a green New York City would be?  Watch I Am Legend.  There's a green New York.  Buildings overgrown with vines and trees.  Did you see the movie over the holiday?  Finally.  Is it good?  Yeah, I like it.  Yeah.  I saw Juno.  Really?  Was it good?  It's a good flick.  It's not for everybody, though, but whatever.  Just enough.  But getting back to the green thing, yes.  Has green been trademarked yet by somebody? 
[00:42:00]  For the most part.  Yeah, registered it.  Everyone's going green.  That's the catchphrase.  It's a catchphrase.  It'll go away, though.  I'm trying to think of another, like one of these types of catchphrases that were big  for a while and then just kind of went away.  Right.  Did you read the paper yesterday, a lot of the tourists that went to Times Square for  the ball dropping?  It was a nationality that we're not allowed to really mention on the radio anymore, but 
[00:42:30]  they decided they needed to wear diapers in the middle of Times Square so they wouldn't  lose their spot for the big ball dropping.  Oof.  Who wore diapers?  Who wore diapers?  Let me think.  Let me see.  They just had a picture of four or five, I believe, Asian people.  Oh, okay.  Waring diaper.  Why?  So they could stand there?  So they could stand there and not have to go to the bathroom?  Because once you're in the pens, see, in the olden days, you used to be able to just 
[00:43:00]  walk into Times Square, drink, and do whatever the hell you wanted.  The ball dropped.  Everyone rioted.  Had a great time and went home.  Now they pin you up in these police barricades.  And then you can't leave once you're in the pens.  No drinking.  No nothing.  You got to go to the bathroom.  So they decided this would be a great way to just make sure that they don't lose their  spot.  Were they babies?  No.  Were they babies?  It was the baby new year.  All right.  When we get back more. 
[00:43:30]  That was just a taste, but a little more audio from Dick Clark.  I don't get it.  It's not courageous.  It's creepy.  He should retire.  The people close to him should say Dick.  Come on.  You know, you had a great career.  Yeah.  But we'll play more of that audio.  Shove off.  And we'll get into some other things.  Yes.  We also got to discuss this writer's riff now with Letterman coming back with his writers  and Jim Lairitz.  Yeah.  And we got Richard Huff calling in.  Oh, we do?  Good.  Yeah.  Richard Huff's great.  He's good.  He is calling in, I believe, right? 
[00:44:00]  A little later on.  Okay, cool.  We'll talk about the late night shows coming back and some other great shows that are starting  up on TV.  All right.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  Jim Norton.  The Opie and Anthony show.  In the middle of playing some audio from Dick Clark bringing in.  Yep.  2008.  2008.  The year of our Lord.  Two years away from 10. 
[00:44:30]  2010.  Nothing's going to be different.  No flying cars.  No nothing.  This 2000 crap was sold to us.  We got this bill of goods sold to us that the year 2000 was going to be this amazing thing.  And now you're talking eight years ago was the year 2000.  It's old news.  It's nostalgia now.  And we got nothing.  We all got GPS now.  Is that the big thing?  Not all.  But there's a big rush for everyone to get their own GPS now. 
[00:45:00]  That's the big thing.  Humorous GPS story I saw on the news out of Amityville, Long Island.  Oh, yes.  A young gentleman that was on his bicycle carrying some goods.  And a police officer pulled him over to ask him questions.  Perhaps, where did you get these goods, young sir?  Wasn't it the nativity scene or was this something else?  It might have been something else.  I don't know.  Because he was just on a bike and he had like...  You ever see guys on bikes that have too much stuff they're carrying? 
[00:45:30]  And you know they didn't leave the house like that?  Yeah.  And it's in Amityville, Long Island.  So it's kind of a high crime area.  So one of the cops goes up to this guy on the bike and starts questioning him on some of the stuff he's carrying.  And one thing is a GPS device.  And he asked him where he got it.  And the guy, of course, can never come up with a good straight story.  I got it at Best Buy.  Yeah.  Oh, I just found it or a friend gave it to me or something.  So the cop, being very wise, took the GPS, hits home. 
[00:46:00]  And when the icon came up and the address came up, he went there.  It was a short way away where the owner had informed him, yes, it was mine.  And it, I guess, had just been stolen out of his car.  So perhaps if you're stealing GPS, the first thing you want to do is erase the home thing in there.  They're putting GPS in everything.  Yeah.  Because there was another story, like some dopey kid stealing a nativity scene. 
[00:46:30]  Why you would do that, I don't know.  It seems to be the thing to do every Christmas.  How bored are you?  Because what are you going to do with this thing after you steal it?  I'm going to steal the baby Jesus.  He's stealing the baby Jesus.  But one town put a GPS in baby Jesus.  Nice.  So they were able to, you know, get baby Jesus back.  Track down Jesus.  They're going to put GPS in everything.  Yeah.  In this year.  This year or next year is going to be the year of the GPS.  Of GPS.  It's going to just take over. 
[00:47:00]  So anyway.  Wait.  There was something else because you said that, but the thing.  Yeah.  That's all right.  All right.  Dick Clark brings in 2008.  Oh.  Talking about, like, technology.  Yeah.  And how, like, you know, we're barely moving forward at this point.  The year 2000 was supposed to be big.  The touch phones are coming in now.  Yeah.  Everyone's going to have an actual touch phone in the next year or two.  But you're right.  In general, nothing does change.  I got the New York documentary that Burns did.  Yeah.  For Christmas, and I've been watching that, and it's just amazing to watch how fast, you 
[00:47:30]  know, this city, Manhattan, came about.  Yeah.  And then you look around and go, wow, what happened, though, man?  The progress really has drastically slowed down.  Yeah.  They knocked down some older buildings.  They put up newer ones that are better, new technology in them and stuff.  But for the most part, like, turn of the century, you know, when 1900 came around, I mean, what  they were doing in this city was just beyond amazing.  Amazing, yeah.  And then they talk about the subway system that we all know here in New York City. 
[00:48:00]  You know, it only took four years to do the entire subway system.  Amazing.  And they had to dig up the ground of the streets.  Can you imagine how long a subway system would take to build in this day and age?  It would be decades.  Yeah.  And cost a lot more.  But, you know, now it's going to be 2010, then 2015.  All of our stupid old 70s movies are all dated now because everything was 2000.  Yeah. 
[00:48:30]  We had colonies on Mars and Venus.  Did we?  No, we didn't.  No.  Haven't even been to the moon in 20, 30 years, whatever the hell it is.  Can't even update the shuttle.  No.  The stupid space shuttle.  That's the same space shuttle they used when I was in college.  With the bathroom tiles that fall off.  What the hell?  That thing looked very modern when I was in Geneseo.  We were rooked.  That's a long time ago at this point.  I'll acknowledge that.  Dick Clark brings in 2008.  Dick Clark comes back from commercial, and this person who wrote this rundown here says, 
[00:49:00]  and I don't know what he says, but Ryan agrees.  Welcome back.  You know, everybody in Times Square came to celebrate tonight, and we're about to add to their fun.  I'm a big, big fan of the young lady who's about to sing, and it's a great way to get our party started.  Ryan?  That is so true, Dick.  That is so true, Dick. 
[00:49:30]  And that's why Ryan Seacrest will always have a job in Hollywood and in entertainment, because he plays along.  If it was any one of us, we'd be like, what the F did you just babble?  Dick, what?  What the F are you trying to say?  Could you take 45 minutes and repeat that, please?  What did you say?  See, we could learn from Ryan Seacrest.  I think he said something about, I really like the anthem everybody's going to sing.  That's something like that.  I think somebody was going to sing.  I think we were all in agreement there. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, is that it?  And I'm thinking Dick either likes the song.  Hey, Dick, take the models out of your circulatory system.  Strokes are awful, aren't they?  Oh, of course they are.  A lot of people don't have to deal with that in their lives.  But, you know, you don't send Grandpa to the factory after he has a stroke.  No.  Give him a nice comfy chair.  Let him rest.  Let him rest and say you had a great career.  You raised our family. 
[00:50:30]  You did everything right.  You don't throw him on TV.  Why are they throwing Dick Clark on TV?  The world's oldest teenager.  Stop saying it's courageous.  It's not courageous.  It's creeping everybody out.  Dick Clark talks about the confetti.  Oh, jeez.  No.  Yeah.  Ah, God.  Well, they did something very special with the confetti this year.  Wouldn't they?  In Times Square.  You were able to leave a little note for a loved one. 
[00:51:00]  Had they given to people half of Dick Clark's head opened up and the confetti just shot out?  Some of the confetti, not all, had little notes on them.  Oh, that's lovely.  Is it?  It's stupid.  It is stupid.  We're live from New York and there are over 6,000 police screaming everybody safe and sound tonight.  When the clock hits midnight, we're going to drop over 2,000 pounds. 
[00:51:30]  What hits midnight?  Imagine, 2,000.  Yeah, something.  Wait a minute.  Let's play that again.  Just replay it.  Something hits at midnight.  Couldn't quite hear that, because my headphones are off.  Yeah.  Put them on and we'll listen.  We're live from New York and there are over 6,000 police screaming everybody safe and sound tonight.  And when the clock hits midnight, they're going to drop over 2,000 pounds.  Wow.  I think he was actually accurately reading Ryan Seacrest's copy. 
[00:52:00]  Let's all get Dick Clark in trouble with the SEC.  Like, he doesn't have enough troubles.  Yeah.  Report him.  We have to report Dick Clark to the SEC.  I'm not sure.  He's a potty mouth.  I don't know what he was saying, but I think he was trying to say it when the clock hits  midnight, but, well, let's.  We're live from New York and there are over 6,000 police screaming everybody safe and sound  tonight.  When the clock hits midnight, they're going to drop over 2,000 pounds of confetti. 
[00:52:30]  Imagine.  In one big lump.  2,000 pounds.  Just on the crowd.  A ton of confetti crushes people.  On pallets.  The ball.  Yeah, just a big square, 2,000 pound chunk on a Dick Clark's stupid head.  Take it off the MTV building.  Watch it plunge 500 feet.  Oh, that'd be fantastic.  That would rock. 
[00:53:00]  1,000 pounds of confetti.  Imagine.  2,000 pounds.  That's double the amount that we started to show 36 years ago.  Marzo.  Dick, that's a lot of confetti.  It's so great to see you.  Always an honor to work with you.  Why won't anyone acknowledge?  No one acknowledges.  They all have to say it's great work with you.  Great to see you.  It's not.  Dick.  It's not.  Well, she just was awful no matter who she was talking to.  Dick, that's a lot of confetti. 
[00:53:30]  Wow.  What insight.  No.  A lot of confetti.  No.  All right.  We get it.  It's a lot of confetti.  All right.  Well, let's move on to Dick Clark counts down from 20 fairly successfully.  Yeah.  That's true.  If they're going green, why so much more confetti?  It does very well.  It does very well with the countdown, which I will bet you was, well, was it pre-recorded?  I don't know.  Oh, man.  Are they going to do that?  Why is he starting with 20?  They should have, all right, Dick, we're going to go start with three.  Yeah. 
[00:54:00]  He started at 20, which he was very successful at.  And then he wishes everyone a Happy New Year.  No, he didn't.  No, please.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Some people have traveled thousands of miles to be here.  We're about to take away.  The noise is building times where everybody is ready to say goodbye to the older and ringing  the new.  It's going to be a whale of a celebration. 
[00:54:30]  So, let's go.  Here we go.  By the way, of course he did the countdown well.  He probably just spent the last year in a chair somewhere.  Counting backwards from 20.  That's all he had to do in the last year.  It was count back from 20.  Of course he did okay with this.  15, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10. 
[00:55:00]  This is actually live from Times Square now.  7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2.  Happy New Year.  Oh, no.  Two.  There's no one.  And then Happy New Year.  Well, of course.  Happy New Year to you.  Oh, Happy New Year, Opie.  Happy New Year, Jimmy.  Oh. 
[00:55:30]  Oh.  This is dot dice.  Happy New Year.  Happy New Year.  Happy New Year to you, Club Soda Kenny.  Wow.  Happy New Year.  He gets the count just about right.  Almost perfect.  And then blurts out, Happy New Year.  I guess you can't make that sound.  That's rough, yeah.  Shut down, man.  Horrible.  This just didn't. 
[00:56:00]  Dick Clark's brain uses less energy than a toaster.  Dick Clark's brain just went green.  They shut down half of it.  Wait, can I hear that again?  Turn off the old lang.  Yeah.  Land.  Old dang dine.  Old lang.  Fine.  12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, Happy New Year. 
[00:56:30]  Oh.  Happy New Year.  Happy New Year.  Look, I enjoy the fact that he's on TV still.  Trust me.  Hey, who doesn't?  But, you know, no one is willing to go, wow, this is a little weird.  I know.  Yeah.  We're just supposed to sit here and not acknowledge it.  Yeah.  Just don't acknowledge it.  Stop it.  Right. 
[00:57:00]  It'd be funny, though, if they were pre-recording it and just, like, the camera was on and you  saw a producer come out and shake his jacket.  It's new, not new.  Do it again.  Do it again.  Stupid.  I see this every year and I mean it.  Every time, from the bottom of my heart, I hope you have a healthy and a happy new year.  Ow.  Let us bring in.  Ow.  Was that an owl or an owl?  Ow.  They poke him with something.  Shut him up.  They poke him with sticks. 
[00:57:30]  They have, like, a little electrical thing.  And when he's talked too much, they just zap him with it.  Oh.  We told you, only five seconds at a time.  They have a little electrode attached to his calf where you can't see it.  Give him a good lower leg shock.  By my heart, I hope you have a healthy and a happy new year.  Ow.  Wait.  All right.  I know where you're going.  Hold on a minute.  I'm with you.  I got to find mine.  A healthy new year. 
[00:58:00]  New year.  New year.  All right.  Don't daze me, bro.  I say this every year, and I mean it.  Every time.  From the bottom of my heart, I hope you have a healthy and a happy new year.  Ow.  Let us bring in the boy one.  Okay.  One more time. 
[00:58:30]  You got to hear it again.  Well, we have to do it one more time.  It's a, it's a, it's a due year.  It's due year.  Happy due year.  Out of my heart, I hope you have a healthy and a happy new year.  Ow.  Let us bring in the boy one.  Let's get it.  Hold on.  Hold on.  There might be more audio.  I, I, I'm not sure if we have some behind the scenes audio here.  Oh.  A few of the takes that didn't make it.  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  Out of my heart, I hope you have a healthy and a happy new year. 
[00:59:00]  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  A little, ow.  Okay.  A little late.  Yeah, a little late.  Let's, uh.  All right.  We are perfectionists.  Yes.  Every time, from the bottom of my heart, I hope you have a healthy and a happy new year.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.

[01:16:00]  jump back into bed and  continue watching biggest  loser couples making  believe nothing happened  she's like what the f was  that i'm like oh i just  decided to start doing uh  scream therapy oh well you  like some primal screaming  yeah i was watching  something they were talking  about scream therapy or i  was reading something i  forget now so i said oh  all right i went out of fat a  while ago i don't know so i  decided to just i didn't know  where a stark scream therapy  last night so she  appreciated that oh yeah

[01:19:30]  together it's one thing me and my  girls do when we're not fighting  which we've been better with we have  a lot of fun together  fun that's what we do we have a good  time together you guys don't fight  though  we just laugh very rarely um yeah we  don't really do you ever argue no i've  never seen you guys argue really i  mean  or terse sure we have but it's not  like uh i think it's healthy to argue  with like your partner but  no in general we're we're good we're  arguing the other night in the hotel  because she came away with me to  boston and uh i just i'm a crazy 
[01:20:00]  person when i argue she's like when we  argue i look at you and i think  there's no like you don't connect any  love to me at all like i disconnect  when i'm arguing and i have i feel  nothing wow like i i'm amazingly  caught up in the anger of it and i  can't like connect so it it might as  well be some idiot out on the street  that did something that pissed you off  and you start arguing with them you  have the same feeling towards your  girlfriend you cut off uh any emotion 
[01:20:30]  it becomes a boy i do watch i mean i  still am aware she's my girlfriend is  like the you know restraint of tongue  and pen as they say you gotta watch  yourself um you don't want to say the  it's unforgivable but i mean i i catch  myself like just i have to win the  arguments like what's wrong with me  it's sickening i think that's normal  i think if you go into an argument you  you just have to win at all costs  well you want to but what's the big  deal if i lose no you have to not you  wanna you wanna sure but you have to as  well but then the other person will  start giving in just to like a riot i'm 
[01:21:00]  sick of fighting so they'll start to  concede the arguments and then they  build up a huge resentment against you  that's a doomer for relationships if  you never give in we we get in weird  arguments like uh when i um i was down  in philly like i said hanging with the  philly crew and then we like spent a  day in the the city at a hotel and stuff  and we have arguments like uh my girl  going to me please don't punch that  lady and why are you kicking that  beamer stuff like that and why are you  biting your hand and then i get mad that  she's asking me that stuff and then we 
[01:21:30]  argue a little bit you bite your hand  i bit my anger thing no i i bite my  hand and i bite my bicep like in  between my bicep and my shoulder  really hard and that prevents me from  doing something stupid yeah i was coming  out of a hotel and um i don't think i've  ever brought this up i i think jimmy and  i are in agreement with this but i don't  think i've ever really talked about this  i have a pet peeve that i forgot about  until uh over the holiday so we're coming  out of this hotel lady with her friend 
[01:22:00]  they're two older ladies probably like  50 some coats from uh head to toe and i  don't know if i've ever admitted this but  i despise people that wear fur i have  never been on a pita website i've never  done a uh demonstration i don't look at  the the horrible videos of baby seals  being like clubbed but when i see someone  in a fur coat especially the one i saw  where you you get to still see the the  red fox's head yeah why did they put  red fox's head was on they do that 
[01:22:30]  the fox of a the head of a red fox right  just i didn't pay my taxes dummy  lemont why am i on a jacket draped  around her neck i go into such a rage  that i i would be one of these people  that would throw paint no problem i'm  just too busy to do that you know but i'm  not gonna go try to save the whales and  what is it if it's not about the animal  and you really don't care about like is 
[01:23:00]  it the wealth that it implies i think  it's like the the absurd wealth and like  yeah it's it's a it's a wealth thing it's a  it's just it's humans being just ugly yeah i  think i think humans in general we're just  ugly creatures i don't and we should  that doesn't bother me though it's  normally the sign not always it's not a  hundred percent but a lot of times  especially people who are who have been  rich for a long time it's it's kind of  the sign of a disinterested pig like they  don't care what they're affecting or or or 
[01:23:30]  what had to be slaughtered for them to  look a certain that has become a symbol of  that right and then but you know my girl's  talking about you know the the whole  chickens and beef and stuff i go i get it  i'm not like hardcore but that's my line  when i see head-to-toe furs it drives me  nuts because it's not one animal either  it's a lot of fucking  sorry i think you're gonna say a lot of  furry animals sorry friends and oopsie 
[01:24:00]  came out like dick clark would have said  oopsie first of the year so i'm sitting  there waiting for the car and they're  just standing there and they're smoking  their cigarettes and they got their botox in  their face and i just despise these two  and i don't even know them and then uh i  couldn't help myself and the guy in the  car and i kind of kind of kicked the  kicked the car oh gee because i had to  do something i was so frustrated that i  was watching this this this display of  wealth in front of me and you can't  disgusting display of wealth and it's 
[01:24:30]  amazing you say something like i hate  fur and then someone will go well do you  wear leather shoes yes i'm not saying  it's 100 consistent with it's just that  bugs me yes yeah i mean i'm yeah i'm  not saying yeah i kind of like that's  my line though everyone everyone has  their line or or in ant's case no line  you know why it doesn't bother me and  i'm serious i'm serious about this our  time will come humans time will come  where we're not so friggin pompous and 
[01:25:00]  top of the food chain and all knowing all  seeing we all think everything that we  do is fantastic and one of these days  hopefully it'll be a giant meteor will  hit or something a god please let it be  an alien race that could just wipe us  out that would be hysterical to watch  people thinking we'd be able to do  something meanwhile the aliens to to  them we're like ants oh yeah like an  ant looking at us going oh i think we 
[01:25:30]  can beat them you know oh kenya  jimmy has a little raid jimmy has  some new material on that yeah yeah  that we heard on uh the other night  yeah i don't remember go see jimmy  soon  i can improv every night's a new hour  but yeah that actually you're right i  mean eventually our time will come that  yeah you know so in the meantime good  think think you're all mighty all  knowing everything our buildings are so  great we fly we do some pretty cool 
[01:26:00]  stuff but the bottom line the time will  come hey tony's got a stupid humans  hate them got tony in jersey tony go  ahead what's up guys hey i agree uh  with opie about the fur on women but i  wanted to know about men do you feel  the same way if a man is wearing a full  fur coat look i'll i'll be the first to  admit i think uh i talk for a lot of  guys out there when i say this when you  see two women that are five five five six  in their you know early 50s wearing fur 
[01:26:30]  it's you you you size them up and go  yeah i could take these two so i'm gonna  get a little obnoxious i'm gonna kick  their car and stuff but if it's like  michael strahan on the giants or some  freaking football player wearing a you  know head-to-toe fur guess what you're  gonna turn around and walk away i concur  that's human nature we all think we're  tough but we always size up the person  we're being tough with you know when  we have road rage it's not it's not uh  with an suv with tinted windows it's  usually a minivan and a woman driving 
[01:27:00]  or or you know what i mean we always  size up people that's why i never mess  with asians because they all know  karate oh you better not say asians on  the radio you you do know you're not  allowed that's true though as a kid i  would never um even try to get in a  fight with a black kid or an asian kid  in school because i assume that the  black is gonna be able to just kick my  ass and yeah that assumption has  always been true and uh i assume that 
[01:27:30]  the asian kid knows some kind of  martial art yeah well i think the  asians martial arts is more cultural so  the odds are yeah yeah i mean that for  them it's a much more cultural thing  to learn the martial arts like for us  it's just a way of kicking somebody's  ass but i think uh a lot of asian  cultures kind of have it as a way of  discipline and like i've know i've  known uh in school there was this one  asian kid all he knew was a stance he  knew the stance to get into if a fight  was going to start and he never had a  fight once he would do that the other 
[01:28:00]  kid would back down how do you know he  didn't know how to fight because he  told me it's just like i i don't know  anything like that he goes i learned one  thing and that was like the stance where  you know you keep your stability yeah and  he puts his hands up and it was like oh my  god this he's gonna bruce lee your ass  but no he just didn't know good defense  big fan big fan first time call thanks  thanks donnie thank you my friend you  know i'm not i'm not telling my story to  act like a tough guy i'll completely admit 
[01:28:30]  it if it's like someone playing you know  in the nfl or something they got a fur  coat on i'm keeping my mouth shut yeah  oh my god what yeah yeah well that's what  that's that's what we're dealing with  jimmy what can i tell you that's corporate  radio for you  come on no way that was no way i'm  telling you you're not allowed to say  anything about asians on the radio or  it'll be dumped out it's oh my god but  it's not we weren't using it as some 
[01:29:00]  type of um of of a stereotype i do  apologize to the asians that listen to  the opian anthony show basically we'd  love to talk about you a little more we  can't mention basically this company has  decided that you guys don't have a sense  of humor so if you're asian that's what  this company is telling you you you don't  have a sense of humor so we're not allowed  to you don't make fun we can't even not  make fun we can't even talk about you  right so i apologize to the asian  listeners you can't be part of the fun  because this show is absolutely  discriminatory to asians and it's beyond 
[01:29:30]  our control we'd love to talk about you  your culture whatever and we're not for  some reason everything we mention about  the asian people and culture gets dumped  out of out of fear and i'm not even  talking bad things or or anything or a  stereotype is a anything we say but by  the way i told you i went and saw juno  yeah and there's a scene and shut up  there's a scene in juno where one of the 
[01:30:00]  characters goes to an abortion clinic and  there's a an asian girl in high school  outside like yeah protesting and  horrendous broken english i'm like there  you go there you go you're a lot of  do it in movies you're a lot of do it on  tv but on radio you're not allowed to do  it oh if you're asian you know they're  basically saying you don't have a sense  of humor and you can't be part of the  opian anthony experience we'd love for  them to be we would love for asian people  to be able to be part of this program but  um i don't know some people have seen 
[01:30:30]  fit to just eliminate you from our  program which i think is a lot more  detrimental than uh talking about the  culture and the people what was crazy  people we have crazy people working the  caller was dumped out and the reason was  because it was a stereotype yeah not one  ounce not one ounce most ill intent not one  ounce no activity just stating a fact and uh 
[01:31:00]  that's gonna lead to every stereotype being  dumped out of a radio but can people just  think a little forward of what is said on  this show and really think if it's gonna  make trouble think if it's worthy of a  group getting together and saying we want  this show uh reprimanded for what they  said when we say one thing we understand  things that can be interpreted as hate  speech uh even in a ridiculous way but  there are certain things that are nothing  more than cultural discussion not even 
[01:31:30]  stereotypes or goofing it's a cultural  discussion that is now being uh uh just  trotted upon on our show asians don't  have a sense of humor that's what the  company's saying apparently that's what  the company's saying good luck to the  next show they bring in good luck good  luck to you good luck because they know  what they're doing that's tough they  know how to compete in the new world 
[01:32:00]  oh it's mind-boggling it really it just  it blows my mind i can almost understand  if they said look we've had trouble with  different special interest groups if you  say something vicious about a group that  that's like like again someone said hate  speech yeah it's intended to really  attack and be horribly derogatory for no  reason no humor we're gonna dump it  because we've had a lot of problems with  these groups and it's a business i 
[01:32:30]  wouldn't like it but i could live with  it i can understand that that's a  business decision it makes sense you to  look you don't we wouldn't be happy  about it but to dump at least there'd be  a reason to dump out of a caller who  mentioned that a certain group knows  karate yeah is i i it is mind-boggling  and that that to suggest that perhaps it  is and not even to be sure about it but  as a discussion to suggest that perhaps 
[01:33:00]  it's cultural it is like it's okay that  it's culture right but apparently it's  not okay why why oh my god it's insane  man asian day asian day on the opium anthony  show i want to invite up asian people and  just discuss the culture a little bit  that's all can we do that or would the  show be taken off the air  ah you know when you go and see juno 
[01:33:30]  which is a great movie that's going to  win all sorts of awards come oscar season  you you'll see the scene i saw and i i sat  there in the theater like amazing amazing  the double standard that is going on if  you're a cartoon character if you're in  a movie you know then you could you could  do uh you could do stereotype uh humor  yeah but if you're trying to entertain  people on a radio show you can't and i  will never understand why that is i will  never understand never infuriating how do we 
[01:34:00]  we are just a nation of pussies yeah not  necessarily a nation yeah a nation it's a  reflection of the country that is well  there's a reflection that type of stuff is  getting you know it's a reflection yeah  getting done in other uh in other circles  there all right move we'll take a break  continue that didn't take long huh a  couple hours in vacation they're just  stupid i know i don't get that at all 
[01:34:30]  really i would really like some kind of an  answer on that one because that was just  crazy they're just stupid that's crazy  paranoia and they don't know what they  got it's too bad yeah whatever crazy  paranoia we'll always be okay i know  that much it's opian anthony  you're checking out the opian anthony  show hi you're right jimmy just it  shouldn't have been dumped thompson it  shouldn't have been dumped he says that 
[01:35:00]  a lot though no i i mean that well i but  that i don't think i think that's a  reflection i look i understand you're  trying to protect the show on the dumb  button and you're doing it man you got  it can't do it like that someone's got to  learn a little more of the finesse i  think of uh working that button a little  there's a little finesse to it there's  split-second decisions that must be made  but you got to understand during the  course of a conversation if the f-word  gets blurted out you know bam you got to  hit that but you got it you got to 
[01:35:30]  listen to the show enough i think to  know what we're talking about so that  when one of these uh subjects come up  where you might dump out you can take  it in the context that it was meant in  and not dump or dump you know depending  on on again the context all right moving  on to other things uh a story we've been  following here on the opian anthony show  window washer dude this guy he's uh  washing windows here in manhattan he's 
[01:36:00]  uh 47 stories up they said about 500  feet and uh the apparatus that he was on  this thing what are they the window  washing what what are those things  called it's kind of uh yeah it's what  what do they call that window washer  platform scaffold thing he's uh washing  windows with his brother the thing kind  of has a malfunction not kind of does  have a malfunction and they fall to earth  well they had complained about the  safety conditions too like there was a 
[01:36:30]  problem where like you know the thing  we've all seen those scaffolding the  scaffolding is that what it's called or  not yeah i don't know what it's called  but yeah it's like a platform and they're  outside the building cables outside from  the roof down and it's not the one where  they sit in it wash windows have you  seen the one where they sit in it yeah  oh my god those are probably safer  actually you're probably less likely to  fall because you're 150 pounds it's  just you and some kind of weird like  kind of leather seat outside of  building but this is not that it was a  platform where two guys could be on it 
[01:37:00]  washing the windows and it slowly goes  up and down you know quickly though  there's another version of the window  washer here in the city that's even  crazier  there's just the guy with the strap have  you seen this guy yeah he just there's  there's like kind of metal clips on every  window of this building because the one  I'm talking about it's a it's a sea and  they kind of lower you down your floors  whatever this guy you know it's attached  well secured yeah this guy just clips  this leather strap which he rests his 
[01:37:30]  butt against and leans out the window now  he's leaning over the abyss and just  watches the outside of the window and  then climbs back in and gets rid of this  little leather strap that goes across his  ass as he's hanging out the window there  you go they're showing that oh my god  that creeps me out yeah anyway stop it  so the the brothers that were washing  windows and then what they were standing  on malfunction they fell 500 feet the one 
[01:38:00]  brother was split in half and died  instantly and the other guy miraculously  survived the fall the update is he's  now well the lawyer's saying he's far from  all right of course of course that's what  you want the lawyer to say my client is  very injured here's your update though  he's far from all right but I'm pleased  to say he's out of the woods the guy's  gonna make it because it was touch and go  if you remember the story if you listen to 
[01:38:30]  this show he survived the 500 foot plunge  they got into a hospital his internal organs  were swelling so bad they had to cut him  open to make room for the organs to swell  just let him sit open like a like a clam on  the half shell with all his organs just  sitting there and he was in goop he was in  a coma and he was a touch and go okay he's  out of the woods they're saying that means  he's gonna survive he's he's going to be  okay relatively speaking uh he's now responsive 
[01:39:00]  conscious so he's out of the coma and he's  now oh and he's not excuse me he's not  paralyzed he has movement in all his limbs  he's gonna obviously have some severe  problems but yeah it's all gravy after  this you fall 500 feet the rest of your  life is you should never be pissed off  about anything again yeah yeah and there's  nothing you're experiencing that that you  should be experiencing except better and  different except for the constant reminder  that that's what happened to you and the 
[01:39:30]  thought in your head of plummeting nighty  night rabbit oh god nighty rabbit can you  imagine that's creepy have fun with your  dreams buddy oh uh here's herb in  cleveland uh good afternoon to you uh herb  what's up hey what's going on i just want  to wish little jimmy a happy birthday thank  you sir i thought you forgot yes um hey  that uh stage that they're working on it's  called a swing stage and the chair that  they sit in is a bolson chair oh there you 
[01:40:00]  go a little knowledge a little knowledge  that i will not remember never use i saw  a video from i think it i want to say it  was thailand i promise this will not be  negative and uh there were guys being  lowered on a building in a chair like  that but there was no safety harness it  looked like there was nothing but these  guys sitting in like these little uh there  might even been wood chairs being lowered  with two ropes it was that you've never 
[01:40:30]  seen worse safety conditions and you  don't hear about you know you don't hear  about it here no one in america cares how  many people must plummet to their death  like that i don't know they didn't look  nervous they were almost too comfortable  how bad do you need your windows washed  just wait for the rain for the most part the  rain will take care of it um all right i want  to see if we rock when you get back over  there i want to see if you can find it  it's uh i i don't know what their call but  literally there was not one piece of 
[01:41:00]  safety equipment they were just sitting  there just very casually washing the  windows yeah yeah hundreds of feet in  the air nothing attaching them so um  creepy ass job getting back to this guy  the fact that he is where he is at is a  miracle and of course they're gonna sue  everybody yeah uh and the wife is very  optimistic she's very tired because she's  been at this guy's side but uh he's gonna  survive it's amazing i can't wait for  that interview how do yeah if you can if 
[01:41:30]  you if he can give an interview we got  audio of the guy falling by the way yeah  they finally released the audio of the  guy fall 500 feet with his brother yes  he's got a mic on uh yes we go to that  audio now oh my god  oh my god oh yeah that's better  still falling  still falling  he's still falling  he's still falling  falling falling falling falling he's still 
[01:42:00]  falling he's halfway down 250 feet to go  it's better exclusive audio of the guy  falling  he's still falling  do you get it he fell a lot that was 
[01:42:30]  far  do you get the gag  and then jim uh liritz uh he was on our  show admitting to taking a few pills while he  was playing and uh he gave us a lot of  press gave us an exclusive interview back  in the day well uh boy is he in trouble  holy crap  oops holy crap uh fort luredale what  celebrating his 44th birthday with some 
[01:43:00]  right some bimbo bar hopping and it's  time to go home and runs a red light and  kills a woman that was just working hard to  support her family yeah as a waitress at  applebee's or something he ran the red  he did yeah like he had like a truck too it  was like a like i don't know of explorer or  something like that and so it's like one of  those ones that hits you you stay hit i mean  it's a big truck and she uh she died with her  husband because she was close to home and the  husband was able to get to the scene and 
[01:43:30]  pretty much watch his wife die oh and then  go home and tell the little kiddies that  mommy's not coming home oh liritz is in  some deep deep trouble deep trouble wow yeah  he's going to jail man that's a mandatory  jail sentence a vehicular homicide is a  mandatory jail sentence is it mandatory  really i don't know if you kill someone  drunk driving you can't get a lawyer to  figure something out for you no way he's  not getting community service death no way  can you uh i don't i don't know the law 
[01:44:00]  but i mean you you cannot get out of  going to jail that shows you i don't know  the law because that's the way i phrased  it you cannot get out of going to get out  of going to jail wasn't legal speak and  there was uh yeah and he was obviously  drunk and stuff and uh you know right  right before new year's i was listening to  the radio and they were talking about they  were doing all their warnings about not  drinking and driving and there were going  to be uh you know roadside checks and all  that and then they had a stat and i wish i  remembered exactly but how many people  die right around new year's from drunk 
[01:44:30]  driving yeah and and it infuriated me  because you never hear the politicians  like hillary and the rest of them like  kind of jumping on that cause because  they know because in the end they know  they can't win that cause without getting  into details but that's one you don't  want to take on if you want to be a  politician if you know what i mean and  but they'll talk about like video game  violence and how this kid went to a  school or went to a mall because of  stupid video games and i'm like man if  you compare the amount of deaths that 
[01:45:00]  could possibly you can't even prove it  possibly happen because of violent video  games and actually people killed around  the holiday because people are drinking  and driving it you can't even compare  the two yeah but soon as some dope  decides to take a gun to a mall or a  school it's all about the violent video  games and the politicians jump on board  gotta like ban violent video games  don't do that then i'll have nothing  to do but go out and drink and drive  right it's the only thing that keeps me  home i know and it's involved in both  of those activities 
[01:45:30]  you know but i forgot what the stat was  but it was it was just unbelievable how  many people die i had a designated driver  for new year's eve by the way yes i was  very happy i wasn't going to drink and  drive because i knew i was going to be  doing some drinking and it's amateur day  you know it's amateur night it's one of  those no one knows how to drink and  drive on new year's eve please tell me  your designated driver was autopilot  no you decided it was my buddy joe who 
[01:46:00]  also took care of jack jack during the  vacation yeah took care of the cat and  decided to play little gags on me yeah  during that him and him and keith uh the  cop just a couple of comedians i come  home from vacation and uh my girlfriend  notices she goes what's in the window and  as we pull into the driveway i notice  there's a giant lit up menorah in my  window  um i'm not jewish i have christmas 
[01:46:30]  decorations all over the outside of my  house but um uh joe thought it would be  funny to put that in my window i guess  to uh you know make me more neighborly  with the neighbors and uh keith the cop  um decided he didn't like my uh desktop  pictures on my computer i didn't like  them one i think was of uh the universe i  kind of like that very trippy another one 
[01:47:00]  was a fish or something like that sure  kind of cool um no he needed his bag on  there his bag bag uh yeah the bag he  carries around with him no matter all the  time no matter what wow yeah that one  um his head is big jimmy he he took he  took he took a picture sorry and put it up  on my computer as my desktop so and i came  in and turned my computers on whammo in  giant 30 inch monitor uh uh size monitor 
[01:47:30]  picture there it was where he's uh  satchel satchel size too he's all bagged  oh jesus were you turned on uh it's still  up there why wouldn't they get down  hey uh let's say hi to jokesters charlie  in jersey charlie hey what's up guys hey  how you doing good um getting back to  that uh stat it's 180 people nationwide  get killed every year in drunk driving 
[01:48:00]  related accidents on new year's wait  wait what'd you say sir 180 people on  on average die in drunk driving related  accidents around new year's alone  uh not just new year's just new year's  just new year's eve i think that's about  what i i remember hearing on the radio  that many  i mean i'm sorry for whoever it was that  you know wait but all i'm saying like  that 180 people a year are guaranteed to  die on the highways from uh drunk drivers 
[01:48:30]  where's yeah yeah where's the outrage one  stupid kid with a you know the video  gaming you know you can't compare it  bro you're saying only on that one day  though right yeah even for one day  the guy on the radio the guy on the radio  is in new york he said 180 people are  going to wake up today and not wake up  tomorrow i was like you got oh well i  slept the whole day i was kind of hung  over did he mean hey can i ask you guys  something real quick yeah yeah i just 
[01:49:00]  wanted to know if there's any truth  that kirk douglas and uh dick clark are  going to co-host the oscars this year  it would be the highest rated oscars  ever no you happy new year to you too  happy new year my friend uh and let's  say hi to pete in boston listening on  bcn pete happy new year what's up guys  hey happy new year all right um he  wasn't listening earlier you guys heard  about the lady that killed at the big  dig the uh roof fell down on top of  oh yeah the big metal plate yeah we've  been following that story too and you  got the update we were going to get to 
[01:49:30]  this but go ahead there pete yeah i  guess family got like 70 million from  the company uh the fastener company in  jersey yeah still looking to sue many  more people how does it work out  mathematically that some woman what  wish what i mean and and nothing  against her her family it's tragic but  who is it tragic but who the hell is  worth 70 million dollars you know what  but you hear stories like this tell me  you're not looking around at the  christmas family christmas party 
[01:50:00]  thinking who you could sacrifice for  70 million 70 mil how do they come up  with the number is it is it more is  ridiculous i mean it's out it is tragic  what happened to her but to ask for even  more money from more people is just  asinine they just dole out millions for  people that probably wouldn't make one  million in their in their life well i  guess then you got to go through pain  and suffering but really but you can't  put a price on a family member when  they exactly you can't so what are you 
[01:50:30]  gonna do anthony so what are you gonna  do  all right 70 million i can understand a  lot of money thank you sir but what  makes a person worth 70 million some  other person worth 10 million the next  time 150 million the next time they do  a story i'm obsessed with this and i'm  sorry i am but this stuff does drive me  nuts when they start jumping on the we  gotta ban violent video games right give  me that stat again you dope 180 people 
[01:51:00]  pay attention follow the show he's uh i  asked eric to look up the drunk driving  guests for the years are possible oh wow  is that the number right there which  number am i quoting from 2005 they might  all right 2005 so even if even if this  went down a little it didn't go down a  lot 2005 which number there eric the  second that's the total amount of people  that die what's the second number wait  eric i think you're wrong go up go up i  think drunk driving guests total  fatalities yeah and alcohol related ones  okay all right so it is the second one 
[01:51:30]  all right uh in 2005 remember this when  they do their violent video game story on  the news and the politicians start  babbling about nothing 16,885 people  died from drunk driving accidents in 2005  that's 39 percent of the fatalities on  the road that year that's that's not too  far from being half of all the highway  deaths or road deaths right from drunk  driving but but you'll never hear a  politician truly take that stat on never  but a violent video game that's easy 
[01:52:00]  crap that's easy crap to take on there  you go  there you go let's go to dennis in  detroit dennis what's up hey i just  wanted to say that uh mr norton you  are one of the funniest wittiest comics  i've ever heard in my life thank you  over and you are really funny thank  you very much the other thing i wanted  to say is that in regard to the  politician issue you know there's no  sensationalism in regard to like  traffic deaths regarding alcoholism but  or alcohol but if you see a piper go 
[01:52:30]  down with two people in it cnn and  msnbc they're all over it yeah i mean  two people go down in an airplane eight  people go out in a car but there's no  sensationalism and that's kind of what's  happened uh to society right now it's  just uh a pure sensational news issue  yeah yeah they like the stories that uh  people can kind of get all like oh look  this who did you hear yeah but you guys  are great all right thank you sir  speaking of the news i mean you get

[01:56:00]  he does a movie once a month  and then has a month off  he's got plenty of time to get his uh  his power up  and i was playing with uh  with bobby kelly  uh oh  and  wait  what  you were playing with the gays  and the gays  yes  i was playing with the gays  do you like playing with the gays  uh  they're a fun group  yeah  bobby kelly  is uh  he's one of the gays  and then a bunch of uh  other people  are you an honorary uh  member of the gays  or a full-fledged 
[01:56:30]  i haven't  i've been asked to be  uh  one of the gays  but i'm really  it's a big decision for me  now we're doing double entendre  humor  see their clan  on the  on the game  is  g-a-a-y  yeah  and that's in front of their names  and they're the gay clan  and um  i uh  i'm kinda leery  to jump in  and uh  be one of the gays here  cause uh  i don't know  i kinda like  first of all  i don't wanna embarrass  any team i'm on 
[01:57:00]  by how crappy i play  you know  i gotta  i gotta get better  i gotta play more  well you're trying to get used  to the xbox control too  cause you're used to  just using your mousy  but now i got  something  you like the mouse  pretty much can use my mouse  and keyboard  on the game  but  ixnay  uh  it's just  it's just uh  i  first of all  also  bobby kelly  is just an ass  he's just an ass  he goes into this  thinking  it's real war 
[01:57:30]  he tries to lead his men  like a  like a commander  bob wants to be respected  yes  just somewhere  on the planet  he wants respect  and he deservedly  gets none anywhere  none  does he say dude a lot  yes  it's constantly dude  because now  we're all sitting around  of course  in our respective homes  but i assume  everybody's sitting like this  with their headset on  there's your little  you can hear  and then a microphone 
[01:58:00]  slung in front of you  uh  and you can talk to each other  when are you guys gonna  see  i told you to start taping  start taping  well  here's what we heard  bobby  trying to breathe  breathing  yeah breathing heavy  and we  we all were ragging him  about it  i was like  where's the option  to shut off the sucking  chest wound  of the dying guy  and then uh  after an hour of that  he told us that  the first complaint  he got  he shoved it  right under his nose 
[01:58:30]  and just left it there  the whole time  to annoy us  and uh  a lot of people  were very mad  and uh  uh  i'm to say  damn it  fix your servers  we couldn't play  yesterday  we were very upset  everybody  and they were saying  you gotta get on the air  and bitch about this  because uh  uh  they wanted to play  and uh  we couldn't get on  on the servers  and you were playing  with the gays  yeah playing with the gays  and you said  alright  you wanna play with the gays  but you don't wanna suck  well  no no  i don't wanna suck 
[01:59:00]  uh  cause i'm not that good  i'm not that good  so i don't wanna suck  and be on the gays  so i gotta wait  until i get uh  better  how did dummy  try to motivate everyone  oh he's just like  alright  follow me  ugh  follow me guys  alright let's do this  he can finally be a leader  or something  and he just runs off somewhere  but then i noticed  yeah  he's kind of at the bottom  of the pile  as far as the score goes  i'm at the bottom 
[01:59:30]  so i don't want him  calling or giving me  crap about it  or anything  cause you're still sucking  cause i suck  but he's been in the gays  for a while  right  you know  and uh  he's a general  i think five star now  and uh  i don't see him  as being that good  i think he's on there  because he's bobby kelly  online he's a five star  general  in life  he's a private  he really is  he's a private pile  he's wanted to say  follow me guys  his whole worthless life  no one's ever 
[02:00:00]  followed him anywhere  there should be an option  to hit him with  bars of soap  and pillowcases  all right  we gotta  we have to take  a quick break  i'm sorry  we gotta talk about  the um  the tiger out there  in san francisco  yes  one of my favorite  stories  hilarious  over the holiday  that we didn't get  to talk about  and i think we're  gonna try to get  richard huff on  to talk about  um  the late night guys  coming back  and uh  the new tv season  yes  even though yes  it's january  but that's what  they do now  they have a second  tv season  it's starting up  you wrote a good 
[02:00:30]  article in the  post  the daily news  we'll try to get  him on after the  break  it's opie and anthony  you're checking  out opie and anthony  a little tease  for tomorrow's show  somebody  associated  with this fine  radio show  got engaged  another  person 
[02:01:00]  got engaged  over the holidays  there it is  and we will tell  you tomorrow  tomorrow  if the engagement  is still on  that's a tease  if it's not  then we won't  that is a tease  let's  I've ever heard  speculating  begin  unless you already  know already  because you're an  insider  and you'll wreck it  for everybody else  let's just say  that women put a  certain pressure on  you to marry them  and actually you 
[02:01:30]  have to do it  so someone  associated with  this very program  uh-huh  is  engaged  yeah  yeah  this is another  one too  but I gotta  talk to anthony  about it  before we  tease that one  ooh  I think  you know what I'm 
[02:02:00]  talking about  I might  I'll have to  yeah  next break  I don't know  we have to  talk for four  I guess  this is another  one like  wow  wow  wow  alright but  what we can do  right now is  talk to our  friend Richard  Huff  he writes for  TV for  The Post  Daily News  oh my god  Richard I'm so  sorry  good one  I'm so sorry  first you have 
[02:02:30]  the announcement  of a funeral  being held  tomorrow  for one of  the staffers  and now you  stay from that  other paper  that hurts  guys  congratulations  by the way  page four  of the Daily  News  they put your  great article  it's not buried  like most of  your articles  thanks a lot  but you know  it's New Year's  Day  they're always  scrambling  for it  just I want  to bring everyone  on board  Richard Huff  we kind of  really hated  and then we  decided to  confront him  and we became  pals 
[02:03:00]  I hate when  that happens  without getting  into like  crazy details  but we love  this guy  he writes about  TV  and of course  the Daily  News  I gotta tell  you though  Richard  I pick up  the Daily  News  in the Post  every day  I don't know  I don't know  which is which  I know you guys  work your asses  off to kind of  distinguish yourselves  but I know  Richard Huff  I just didn't  know what paper  you wrote for  you wrote the  article about Dave  coming back  because Leno  has typically  been beating  him in the  ratings for a  long time  and World Wide  Pants cut a  deal with their  writers to come 
[02:03:30]  back because  Letterman owns  his show  Leno doesn't  and I've kind  of had mixed  feelings about  what this means  for the  writers  strike  what do you  think  is this better  or worse  for the  writers as a  whole  well you know  I think in  some ways it's  better only  because some  of them get  back to work  you know this  thing's dragging  on people have  been talking  already about  some writers  strike fatigue  you know where  this goes I  don't know but  I do think in  some ways it's  a little better  just because  people are  working  well I mean  what's happening  is like  Letterman's  people are  going back  to work  I mean 
[02:04:00]  they've cut  the like  Letterman I  think World Wide  Pants gave  the writers what  they wanted  but what it  does in a way  it's a weird  like catch 22  like you're  happy for those  guys because  they're going to  be working again  but the rest of  the writers now  like Leno's  writers Leno's  been a big  supporter of the  writers but he  doesn't own the  Tonight Show so  he can't cut the  deal that Letterman  could cut or he  would so now  he's kind of  screwed so he  has to go back  without writers so  isn't it almost  letting them  continue with the  shows now like  didn't that kind  of open the  floodgates for the  networks to  continue the  shows you mean 
[02:04:30]  the late night  shows yeah yeah  yeah well I  think you know  those shows are  different in the  sense that they  they so depend on  that topical stuff  just like you guys  every day you're  talking about stuff  that's happening  today that's what  depend those shows  depend on so at  some point you got  to bring them back  it'd be great to  have writers  obviously because  we're not sure  what these shows  are going to look  like without  writers well just  listen to the  Opie Nancy show  visual drivel  well you know 
[02:05:00]  this is basically  saying hey why  did you get a  writer or two  well you know  they're going to  be different though  they're not going  to be able to do  the sketch bits  that they use to  fill in time  they'll probably  have to have more  guests to fill in  some of that extra  time and shows  like you know  Leno and Conan  what kind of guests  are they going to  get because people  are afraid to cross  picket lines  well I think this  will hurt Leno  unfortunately  I love Jay  but I think it's  because his strength  to me was the  monologue  because Jay is such  a good comic  and whether people  don't understand  how edgy he is  in today's climate  the racial stuff  he does  the social stuff  he does  that to me 
[02:05:30]  was the strongest  part of the  Tonight Show  is that monologue  that long monologue  and you're right  a lot of the guests  would be probably  afraid to go on  his show at the  risk of pissing off  the writers  I don't know much  about Jay Leno  but it seems like  he writes a lot  of that monologue  I know he has  writers helping  him but just  with his background  as being a  comic  I think he gets  a lot of his  lines in there  well yeah  what's the rule  with that Richard  because he's a  WGA member  but he's also  Jay of the  Tonight Show  is he allowed  to write for it  well technically  according to the  union rules 
[02:06:00]  no he's not  allowed to perform  any written  material or to  do the work  that writers  normally do  the network  is arguing  that that's not  the case with  these guys  and you're  absolutely right  I mean Jay  writes a lot  of his stuff  every time I've  ever talked to him  he's thrown jokes  out just to see  how they work  and also we can't  deny the fact  that all of these  guys got into  this spot  because they're  talented  and out on the  road as you know  Jim  it's you  so you can't 
[02:06:30]  discount their  role in this  it's a matter of  how much of that  extra stuff  is helped by  others  well Conan  was not  Conan I think  is more of a  writer  and he may  I don't know  if he'll have  trouble  because again  I really don't  watch the show  but it's like  now he's not  a stand-up  he's certainly  capable of  talking and  being conversational  but he's not  a traditional  stand-up  so he's going  to be forced  into a role  where he doesn't  have like you  know 20 years  of stand-up  experience behind  him  maybe  Letterman was  a stand-up  comic too  so I don't  know it should  be kind of 
[02:07:00]  interesting to  watch  I'm going  to be watching  if it will  hurt  because Dave  is going to  get like he's  got Robin  Williams tonight  he's going to  get all these  guests  you know why  you got Robin  Williams  just let him  babble for 40  minutes  the show's over  babble babble  I mean they  don't have to  fill time  trust me  well it's also  a statement too  because Robin  was a big  supporter of the  writers  so for him  he was on the  picket line  I went out to  the picket line  a few times  it was a who's  who  it was fun  to check out  you know all  I'm noticing  though in the  news is all 
[02:07:30]  stories about  how they're  getting around  the strike  I haven't  heard one  word about  negotiations  or how they're  trying to settle  this thing  anyone who's  talking  this is really  one of those  situations where  no one seems  to be trying  to solve  the problem  well you know  the talks  broke down  a couple weeks  ago and as  of now  there aren't  any talks  scheduled  and I think  the union  is hoping  that deals  like Letterman's  show that  people can  negotiate 
[02:08:00]  some of  this stuff  now I mean  let's not  forget the fact  too that  Letterman's able  to do this  because he  owns his  shows  and some  of the  stuff that  they're arguing  over he  can't control  anyway  so you know  how his  show gets  on cbs.com  is really  in cbs's  hands  so there's  some you know  wiggle room  in some of  that stuff  I just think  it's odd  sometimes  when these  unions are  so deeply  involved in  people's  livelihood like  this  and I  do understand  there are  issues  you know  the writers  want  what they 
[02:08:30]  want  they want  a cut  of things  that they've  been cut  out of  for so  long  but  again  just because  you're a  writer  why do you  have to be  part of this  giant group  that all  has to be  treated the  same  how about  like they're  doing with  the late  night shows  you get  your job  and it's  based on  your individual  merits  what you do  what deal  you make  with your  employer  because that  seems to be  what a lot  of people  have to do  unions  kind of  they really  hold 
[02:09:00]  companies  hostage  sometimes  and it  hurts  everybody  I mean  it hurts  there are  people that  have nothing  to do  with this  that are  out of  work  it does  hurt  people  that like  the thing  is this  I'm sorry  I didn't mean  to cut you off  it's like  the bad part  is like  what you're  saying  that like  a lot  of times  weakness  is rewarded  because they're  union members  but I think  in a case  like this  from what I  understand about  what the  writers are  asking for  is justified  so it's like  the union  is the only  way to show  strength  because as  individuals  man these  guys they  pay Adam  Sandler  20 million 
[02:09:30]  a film  there's no  one that  they wouldn't  individually  just cut off  man these  companies can  outlive  anybody  but how  about  your talent  right  you're a  talented  writer  you would  then  deserve  to earn  more  to get  more  of what  you ask  for  just like  anything  in any  job  that you're  in  you're  based  it's based  on your  merits  at work  why should  you be  lumped in  together  let's say  you're just  in an office  and you do 
[02:10:00]  your job  very well  some idiot  is a  loafer  I like to  say Jimmy  a loafer  and why  are you all  lumped into  one category  that you should  all make  this amount  of money  and get  this and  this  I think  writers  should  based on  their own  merits  that should  be how  they're  compensated  I think  they are  though  Richard  I don't  know  what  the scale  is  but I'm  sure  that  Bill  I think  Bill  Shefft  I believe  is the  head writer  for Letterman  I'm sure  he probably  makes more  I probably  does  based on  the union  contract  not based  on hey  I hammered 
[02:10:30]  out this  deal  or my  agent  hammered  out this  deal  with  this  company  I just  the union  thing  I think  worked  well  when people  were really  being taken  advantage  of  and now  I think  it's gotten  to the  point where  the unions  and the  companies  too  are able  to even  take more  advantage  of these  people  because there  are still  unions  Richard  do you know  how that  works  the structure  of the  writing  pay  you know  I am  not an  expert  on how  that works  but I  think the  unions  basically  cover  the  minimums  in those  cases  the same  thing  with the 
[02:11:00]  acting  union  there are  minimums  that you  are required  to get  to appear  on certain  shows  but of  course  if you're  a better  actor  you can  make more  money  and I  think it's  the same  way with  writers  I'm not  exactly  sure  about  that  but I  believe  that's  the case  as you  just  mentioned  and you're  right  I mean  you wonder  why  everybody's  covered  in the  same  way  but that's  the way  this system  has been  set up  with the  directors  guild  the writers  guild  the actors  guild  and I  can see  the writers  guild  point  as people  and we're  product  creators  you and  I  and all  of us  and the 
[02:11:30]  extra  ways  it's  getting  out  there  they want  some  piece  of that  don't  you think  that some  writers deserve  that and  other writers  don't  and why  should they  all be in  the same  category  where they  all deserve  it  see that's  what I  don't  understand  you're  forcing  people  to pay  you more  money  give you  more benefits  when maybe  you just  don't deserve  it and  maybe this  guy deserves  twice as  much  well the  writers  that's  the union  way  I mean  it's  been that  way  forever  be it  doormen  or writers 
[02:12:00]  and it's  been that  way a long  time  extortion  you know  but the  sad thing  is  as you  pointed out  before  a lot  of people  are getting  hurt  the guy  who makes  egg salad  sandwiches  for the  craft truck  at the  Leno show  if there is  one  or any  of those  other things  that guy  it really  had to  hurt  through  Christmas  and he's  still  he's  selling  less  sandwiches  he's not  doing the  work he's  normally  done  and he's  not tied  up in  all this  stuff  well  don't  forget  one  thing  though  with  these deals  with DVD  payments  the writers  are kind  of making 
[02:12:30]  it on their  own  merit  because  you're  only  going to  be paid  for the  stuff  you've  contributed  on  it's  not like  the guys  who write  garbage  B movies  are going  to be  paid  on  like  you know  30 rock  syndication  money  you're only  making the  money on  the stuff  that you've  contributed  so if  you're a  low level  writer  who's just  making a  minimum  and you  haven't  contributed  to any  of this  stuff  you're not  going to  be making  anything  from it  but if  you're a  writer  for 24  or any  of these  major  shows  then you  will reap  the benefits  because you've  kind of  earned it  by writing  a hit  show  well that's  true  good point  Jimmy  it's also 
[02:13:00]  you know  that guy  who's making  that B movie  if that B movie  is you know  delivered on  the stars  website  or something  they want  that extra  money  again  it's you know  we're in this  new age  of delivery  systems  where you can  get stuff  on cell phones  and what not  and somebody's  making money  off of that  I remember  years ago  when the  friends was  still on the  air  and the cast  got upset  because they  heard some  syndication  executives  say oh  we're going  to make  three million  an episode  and the cast  sat around  and said  well wait  a second  we're only  making a  few tens 
[02:13:30]  of thousands  an episode  and the next  thing you know  they held out  and got a  million an  episode  so you know  we're all  hearing about  these other  delivery systems  look my  stuff goes  on the  internet  now on  the daily  news website  that's an  extra use  of my  material  you know  that's  essentially  what the  right  you must  be getting  dozens  of hits  well it's  the way  I'm able  to take  the time  to talk  to you  guys  my vacation  home over  on the  west side 
[02:14:00]  don't forget  companies are  never going  to volunteer  to give you  money  like I  think I  could be  wrong  but Joyce  Randolph was  the only one  to get  like syndication  money out of  the honeymooners  because they  didn't have  the foresight  back then  and I think  her brother  was a lawyer  correct me  if I'm wrong  somebody but  like the  millions of  dollars that  was raked in  because of  that brilliant  show  the people  that made  it probably  saw virtually  none of it  because again  yeah they  didn't know  about that  syndication  thing back  then  it comes 
[02:14:30]  along  I mean  so I can  understand  that angle  at some  point though  it gets  too long  it's you know  how long  is this going  to go  yeah I  think the  technology  completely  outran  people's  I don't  know  the way  people get  paid for  it  you know  things are  getting thrown  around  now like  you said  on the  internet  and other  delivery systems  you can download  it onto your  iPod  things like  that  and no one  saw this  coming  so  you know  whose fault  is it  really  well the  question is 
[02:15:00]  can they  make up  the money  they've lost  in the next  deal  and that's  the big  unanswered  question  right  hey  Richard  they're going  to take us  off the air  here  but we  want to  talk about  some of  the TV  shows that  are popping  up  could you  maybe give  us a call  back tomorrow  we'll do  the second  half of the  interview  whenever you  want  all right  we'll have  Richard Huff  tomorrow on  the show  discussing  some of the  shows out  there  what show  do you  really like  real fast  well a show  I really love  is called  Life but  they've run  out of  oh that's  right you  were telling  us about  that last  time  yeah so  now we're  waiting to see

[02:18:30]  Thank you. 
[02:19:00]  Thank you. 
[02:19:30]  Thank you. 
[02:20:00]  Thank you. 
[02:20:30]  Thank you. 
[02:21:00]  Oh, the people that showed up.  Oh, my God.  Hold them back, Kenny.  Hold them back.  We're trying to broadcast here.  Would you rather have quantity or quality of the fan?  Right, right.  Because I'm looking at one fan.  A fan.  Yes, Mr. Norton.  Yes, Mr. Norton.  Oh, thank you.  Hey, fan.  Couldn't see, Jimmy.  Thanks for welcoming us back by not showing up today. 
[02:21:30]  But it's Brazilian girls.  It makes us feel like it.  Does she work here at this point?  I asked her that one.  I'm like, hey, would they give you a job?  They will.  It doesn't matter.  Who's she having sex with?  I don't know.  Her boyfriend.  She's banging anybody.  Her boyfriend.  Her boyfriend?  Yeah, there's no getting past him.  Anyway.  We're here at XM Satellite Radio. 
[02:22:00]  She was at the party.  I got Danny's birthday party there Friday.  Boy, that was right before vacation.  Were you at that?  Yeah, it kind of blew me off, to be honest with you.  Did I?  If you want to bring it up, yes.  I tried to say hi to you, and my girl even noticed, too, that we both tried to say hi to you,  and you mumbled about going to the bathroom.  Let me tell you something.  And I mean mumbled.  Dude.  I had the worst stomachache I've ever had in my life and had to friggin' sing.  I thought I was going to shit myself. 
[02:22:30]  Here we are on XM Radio.  Hi.  I thought I was going to shit myself.  Yeah.  It was that bad.  At one point, I was singing something, and just like, I broke out in a cold sweat, and  I'm like, Joe, do some Hendrix.  And I had to go to the bathroom, and then there's fans, and they go, what are you doing,  Anthony?  I'm like, shitting my brains out.  Nice.  It was that bad.  So, nothing personal, Opie.  I swear, it was all about shitting.  It's funny you should bring that up, because you walked right by, and I was sort of trying  to say hi, and I'm like, oh, all right. 
[02:23:00]  No, I really did.  I had to go to the bathroom.  Believe me, I wish I didn't, because it would have felt a lot better, because you know what  it's like when you're thinking of the next note that's got to come out of you, and it's  like a high one that I've got to kind of really hit, and thinking, all right, the note's going  to come out of my mouth, and shit's going to come out of my hands.  Dude, your shit is pretty good, by the way.  I heard you singing Creep by Radiohead.  Oh, thank you, sir.  Holy crap, that was good.  Thank you.  That was really good, actually.  Yeah, it's fun.  Hey, can I talk about my non-sexual hard-on? 
[02:23:30]  Non-sexual hard-on?  As long as you show it.  Right.  Oh, boy, I wish I can, Jimmy, because you want to talk about presentation.  I was quite impressed.  Non-sexual hard-on.  New Year's Eve, we all partied at FH Riley's, I don't know where it is.  It's somewhere in Huntington.  New York Avenue?  400 New York Avenue, motherfucker.  Oh, thank you, sir.  All right.  My brother's doing a little construction the next couple of days, adding a couple extra seats 
[02:24:00]  so we don't have to turn people away.  Food was very lovely, by the way.  Food!  All right!  I ate, what the fuck did I eat?  I ate a Caesar salad, and then I had, god damn it, some grilled chicken.  It was very good.  You went basic.  Yeah, and then I had a piece of cheesecake and Oreo cheesecake.  Oh, Holly's cheesecake?  Can I tell you, she's going to be making cheesecake for everybody.  She's going to get a little business together.  It's going to be ridiculous.  Very good.  We've got to figure it out. 
[02:24:30]  She's got a double oven, and she's ready to start baking for the masses.  Because her cheesecake is ridiculous.  What's this?  I don't know.  It's a male.  What is it?  Fan mail from some flounder?  Well, first of all, this is a Christmas card.  I've ripped it up.  Okay.  I don't want that.  Thank you, Chris.  Thank you, Chris, Ohio, and family.  I've never seen more childlike fan writing.  Aw, really?  To Jimmy and girlfriend.  It looks like it was written like there's a hostage note attached to it. 
[02:25:00]  It really is.  A ransom note.  Very, uh...  Mine says to Opie and woman.  Thank you.  To a woman.  Thank you, Chris.  Chris and Ohio and family.  That's very funny.  Thank you.  I always say fan stuff.  I never, ever throw it out.  From marketing and advertising.  Well...  Oh, my God.  That gets there.  We got an invite from...  We should go through the mail every once in a while.  Because it is fun.  We get some dumb stuff.  We just got an invite to Jill from Jill TV's 30th birthday party. 
[02:25:30]  Oh, cool.  I didn't get one.  God, I thought she was a lot older than that.  What happened?  Oh, I...  I was going to say, what, did we miss it?  Oh, that's terrible.  I think she got breast implants during the holiday, though, because...  Jill's turning 30?  Yeah, she's turning 30.  When?  Friday, the 11th of January, 2008.  That's 7 o'clock in the evening.  At, uh...  What?  Somewhere out on Long Island? 
[02:26:00]  Ah.  Stupid garage.  Bethpage State Park.  Where's that?  We're just opening.  It's mail day.  Carlisle on the green.  Where's that?  Oh, God.  Oh, Jesus.  Well, I'm fucking working.  Why are you doing that?  Because of my New Year's resolution, I actually have one.  I want to be more of an ass in the New Year.  Wow.  That's my New Year's resolution.  It's like the ocean wanting to be wetter. 
[02:26:30]  Gregorio wants to be more of an ass in the New Year.  Well, with the screaming in the bathroom and Gregorio, you are well on your way, my friend.  I was hoping for more of a reaction to my scream therapy bit I did today, which was real.  It wasn't even a bit.  That's just it.  It's too real.  Well, dude, you're dealing with a sex addict and a man that blacked out and had to fucking  watch himself on videotape.  We're not exactly two regular guys.  Yeah, but just walking into the bathroom and just start, you know, and I started screaming. 
[02:27:00]  You know, I thought I'd get a little more of a reaction.  It was the truth.  I should have fucking filmed it.  Yeah.  So I was going to tape it.  Oh, I'm going to start filming, too, like you.  Just start taping shit.  That's it.  All the time.  Tell me what video camera to get, because I'm going to videotape stuff now.  The easiest one I've found to work with.  Write it down.  I'm buying it today.  And I'm going to start videotaping myself.  This little guy.  It's a little sanyo.  That's sweet.  It's the exacty.  Is that the one where you were going really fast? 
[02:27:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, it's really good quality, especially for what it is.  It's like not, you know, high def or anything.  Wait, it's not high def?  Write it down.  No, because it's just a little teeny video camera.  It's for regular.  And it takes a flash drive, so you don't have to download videotape.  You just take a one gigabyte flash drive, pop it in your computer, drag and drop it  right off of there.  Yeah.  How much?  Let me ask you a question.  I don't know much about video, despite everybody thinking, God, you're so brilliant with video.  How much can you get with like, oh, no, not money. 
[02:28:00]  How much can you save on a one gigabyte flash drive?  One gig, I could get a good couple hours.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You could tape for a couple hours on one gig?  Yeah.  How much on two gigs?  Uh, probably four hours.  Perhaps more than that.  Seriously, how about three gigs?  Uh, that would probably be like maybe 2,300 hours.  That's what I was working my way up to.  All right.  So, uh, cool.  How much was that?  Like fucking 500 bucks?  This was under five.  Oh, all right.  Yeah.  Where can I get that?  And it's handy because it stays right in your pocket. 
[02:28:30]  Where can I get that?  Um, I ordered mine online.  Where can I get it though?  For a couple of hundred bucks.  No.  Where can I get it today?  Oh, you mean get it.  I got, I got ideas for bits that will either get me punched in the face or, or make me  a YouTube star.  I'd go down to the place with all the Jews.  That's fucking Hollywood.  I love it.  No, it's not that place.  It's on 34th Street.  It's the best fucking video place.  I love it.  The big, the big, the big city.  B&H.  B&H.  B&H.  They're not even a sponsor, but everything I get, I get from B&H because they are amazing.  Write that down. 
[02:29:00]  I'm getting it today.  All right.  I'm serious.  I'm serious.  And then just videotape everything you do.  B&H is on 34th Street in New York.  No, see, uh, MySpace wants to start an Opie and Anthony channel.  We're trying to figure that out.  Yep.  What?  I'm listening to you.  Oh.  I'm looking at you and listening.  And, uh, ooh, I have attention.  Um.  I hope that's so defensive.  He's like talking and I'm listening.  He's like, what?  I'm like, I'm just listening.  Usually I just babble and entertain myself.  I'm like, oh no, we're actually getting great. 
[02:29:30]  And I listen to the replay.  Well, I should have got a reaction to that one.  I definitely should have got a little reaction for that one.  There's other, there's different models of this camera.  It's kind of weird to actually see you guys like looking at me and looking like you're  paying attention.  Why don't you think we pay attention?  I feel the same way when I talk though.  I literally feel like, well, this one's going nowhere.  Like whenever I tell a story that's not, like when I told the Ozzy and Sharon story today,  look, granted, it's not a 9-11 story.  I made it out of Tower One.  I'm not saying it's supposed to rivet you.  Right.  But maybe some eye contact would have been nice. 
[02:30:00]  Dude, I felt like literally, I could have been looking.  I had an excuse.  I was looking for your fucking voicemail.  I'm not even mad.  It's my insecurity.  Oh.  I literally felt like I was looking at my water bottle and going, please, just acknowledge  that there's a person with words coming out.  Oh, boy.  And my story went nowhere.  There was no payoff.  And I'm like, I rushed to the end of it.  I'm like, so?  I saw four eyes divert away from it.  I went, oh, we got there early.  Please, God.  Please, God.  Did you start raising your voice?  Yeah, like, just to make it more exciting.  But it wasn't. 
[02:30:30]  To bring the attention back to you?  Yes, I moved my hands a little, hoping you guys would see, like, movement.  Like, ah, there's something happening.  No, no, it's just him again.  It's just that fucking, it's just that fat lump of shit with a mouth in the middle of  it.  And words coming out.  So, New Year's resolution, mine is to be a bigger ass in 08.  Right.  I felt like I was too nice in 07, and it didn't make me happy whatsoever.  It didn't get me anywhere, so I figured I'll go back to my old ways.  Well, hold on.  You did Gregorio.  That'll work.  You did the screaming, and you asked Richard Huff, you said he got 12 hits. 
[02:31:00]  12, yeah, that was pretty mean.  And I kicked the BMW in Philly.  Because the old bags were wearing fur.  Well, because I knew they didn't know karate.  I knew I was safe.  That was after I bit my shoulder.  I don't know.  It's in between.  It's that, see, anyone can bite their bicep or their shoulder muscle, but to go in between  where there's just a little skin there that doesn't develop, oh boy, you're doing damage.  So anyway, my non-sexual boner.  Oh. 
[02:31:30]  So we were all up.  And we were somewhere.  We were all partying at FH Riley's, and I decided I need lots of water.  So my brother has these big blue bottles of water, so I'm like, I was done drinking,  so I'm like, I'm going to drink one of these before I attempt.  What is that like?  Like, what?  Drinking water?  Being done drinking.  Being done drinking.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Anthony knows it's time to stop drinking when his eyes flutter open.  And he goes, oh, what was that?  What happened?  Let's go to the videotape.  Just blood and hair ribbons. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah.  That's all I see.  This is where Jimmy and I are different.  This is how, I guess it should be acknowledged.  When Ant tells these crazy stories, I kind of, I kind of like enjoy them, and I laugh really  hard, and I'm hoping it's really horrific.  And Jimmy is like, so like, holy shit, what are you doing?  What are you doing?  He yells at me.  He goes, what are you doing?  Well, after, after.  And I'm almost like disappointed by the end of this unbelievable story.  It didn't end in some kind of tragic death.  Listen, if I had fuck you money, I would enjoy it too. 
[02:32:30]  But I don't.  And I don't want to see the radio show.  I don't either, really.  I don't.  I don't have fuck you money.  I have go to hell money.  Yes.  I have please don't hurt yourself money.  Please don't hurt yourself.  Plus, I don't want to see my friend injured.  I worry.  Of course not.  Because it would be, it would just be a tragedy if such a brilliant guy was struck down early.  Horrible.  It would make for a good story, though.  Yeah, it would.  But then you'd be like, hey, weren't you on that show that you, it would be just depressing. 
[02:33:00]  Oh, he's right there.  Why don't we continue with the show?  So, so I drink this enormous, enormous bottle of water.  Went right to your dick.  Then you got some beers in you.  Yeah.  And you got some wine in you.  So you got a lot of fluid in you.  And I go back to the hotel.  And the middle of the night, I got a rager.  Piss hard on.  Holy fuck.  And then I, I woke up and I was, I looked at it.  I was like, wow, that's pretty impressive.  I got to admit.  I'm going to do something with that.  I almost want to take a picture.  And then I, and then I was deciding, well, I can't really sleep because this thing is so raging and pulsating. 
[02:33:30]  Jesus Christ.  It's, it's one of those hard-ons where it just aches deep down where you don't even know what muscle is aching.  Years ago on NEW, I was talking about something like that.  And I said, sometimes you just got to grab, not sexually or anything.  Yeah.  You just got to grab it, squeeze it and go, ugh.  Right.  Well.  Just bang, die.  Enough. 
[02:34:00]  By the way, this is another, this is another story I told my girl and I had her in stitches and I, and she thinks I'm just, well, she knows I'm insane.  Um, so then I'm like, wow, after I, I admired it and attempted to fall asleep and I couldn't because it was pulsing and aching and Jesus Christ.  Then I'm like, you know what?  I think I might have to, uh, I might have to jerk off to get rid of this.  Wow.  So I'm thinking, I think I might, but then I realized at that moment that it wasn't a sexual hard-on. 
[02:34:30]  It was, it was a, uh, a piss hard-on.  It was just a piss hard-on, yeah.  And then I'm like, this sucks because if, if it was a, if it was an erotic hard-on, you could take care of it, right?  You could just get it done.  Get the job done.  If it's a piss hard-on, even when you're done, you're still going to have the ache and you, because you're filled with piss, right?  So I go to the bathroom to relieve myself.  Why are you looking around?  This is what made Lindsay laugh.  This is actually how, how I had a leak. 
[02:35:00]  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  All right.  No.  So it's like this, right?  A little visual.  I was like this, right?  Like basic stance, Superman stance.  I'm like, fuck.  So then I decided to go like this.  Now he's leaning forward.  Hold on.  Let me paint the visual.  There's a bucket under him.  Like I'm getting frisks.  Yes.  Leaning against the wall.  Right.  Pointing that delicious appendage.  And then I had to go, and I had to keep, I had to walk down the wall with my legs like this.  Until I was about at a 45, can you see this? 
[02:35:30]  Like a 45 degree angle.  Yes.  He's right now.  It looks like he's doing a push up against the wall.  And then that didn't work.  So then I literally got down almost 33, wait, what would be, yeah, like 30 degrees.  Yeah.  So then my dick would be finally pointing at the ball.  Why don't you hold it?  Like you weren't holding it?  Yeah, but you can't bend it down.  You can't bend it down.  You can't bend it down.  Yes, you can.  You don't want to bust that thing off.  I fucking, I kick my ass back like a cat and I point it down gently and I can piss. 
[02:36:00]  That hurts.  You're insane.  You can't bend a boner down.  You don't understand the state I was in then, Jimmy.  There was no bending.  There was no touching.  This thing had a life of its own.  Believe me, I understand the state you were in.  I have the Disney Channel.  And then I, Opie, why stay at hotel?  Why not at Ant's house?  I've never seen Ant's house.  I haven't either.  And I don't think I'll ever see Ant's house.  I'm dying to see Ant's house. 
[02:36:30]  You will?  He gives these very vague invites.  Yeah, hey, if you're ever in the area and you happen to know where it is.  Hey, you know, give me a call sometime and then maybe you can stop by and check it out.  Me and my girl go by and we have a few laughs.  You know something?  Hey, you know, if you happen to be in the...  Well, Ant, I'm in the area every weekend.  Well, you know, give me a call and if I'm not passed out or driving real fast on the  Southern State Parkway...  All right, I promise one of my resolutions in 2008 are to have you guys both over my house. 
[02:37:00]  No.  Have both of you guys over my place as many times as you've had me over yours in 2007.  You're invited to my place.  Shut up.  I've never been there.  Never seen it.  You've been there long.  I may shut up.  You're welcome.  Dude, 2007 was the year of the mousetrap.  I've only been in my new place a few months.  That's right.  And it's being re-decorated from head to toe.  Revamped.  Probably had more done than I do.  Revamped.  Oh, I'm way ahead of you now.  I'm never home. 
[02:37:30]  Way ahead of you.  Anyway, so then I was...  By the way, my girlfriend, it's like fucking having a tsunami over.  Could you fucking use a dresser drawer once, baby?  You've never seen a messier chick.  Really?  Oh, my God.  You got the messy chick?  Oh, she actually...  After she...  I know she's always gone to the bathroom because there's shitty toilet paper all over the living  room floor.  She just throws it out the fucking door.  Clothes strewn all over.  Oh, shit.  So then I'm attempting this leak and it's just kind of going in spurts. 
[02:38:00]  And I was...  That's rough.  I was this close to searching out a plate.  A plate?  Because I kind of had this weird room where you kind of could maybe cook stuff.  And they had cabinets and stuff.  I was going to get a plate to do a ricochet.  Oh, shit.  No joke either.  I was that close because I was in such pain with this thing.  A cup might work. 
[02:38:30]  Because of all the freaking liquid I was drinking.  And then it would, like, come down.  But then you're getting it down your fucking shaft and nuts and everything.  No plate.  That's why you go plate.  Yeah, but then it's going to spray.  It's going to hit.  Holy shit.  It's going to hit and then kind of fall.  And it's not my house, so I don't care.  How about the curtains?  You're in a fucking hotel.  Just piss on the drapes.  Who cares?  Who cares?  Fuck them.  I try to piss when I don't even have to.  Into the fucking air conditioning vent.  What's the matter with you? 
[02:39:00]  So, anyway, that was my raging, non-sexual boner story.  Did you want to have Jack in it?  No, because it wasn't about that.  I mean, after it went away, wasn't you still a little plump?  No, I went down to, like, you know, normal size, which is pretty impressive.  Just hanging around.  What I do with those, when I have a raging boner like that, is, like, my girls will sleep  on the side, and I'll kind of stand over it, give the old tap on the face, and I'll  just say, like, suck, puppy. 
[02:39:30]  Suck, puppy.  And that works.  Yeah.  Suck, puppy.  All right.  Want to take a break before we introduce the mad scientist and what's his name?  I don't know.  Epstein or something?  Yeah, but.  Epstein.  Epstein?  I have been.  Episode one?  When I had read this in the email on upcoming things on the show today, I could not wait. 
[02:40:00]  All I know, new characters.  Yeah.  Steve and Sam present the mad scientist and Epstein.  Episode one, after the break.  This has got to be good.  And then we got sexual pleasures, the breasts.  Remember?  Pleasures.  What was the other one we did before break?  The asshole?  The buttocks.  Remember that creepy doctor when he talks about the breasts?  Talking about the asshole and how it opens and closes on your dick?  He didn't say that. 
[02:40:30]  Yes, he did.  No, he didn't.  Yeah.  Yeah, he was talking about lumen it up or something.  It's like a flesh glove that smells like manure at all times.  Very sexy, Doc.  Oh, way to get us all revved.  A little revving going on.  Yes.  And there were some other things we'll remember after the break.  And when you yank it out quickly, it looks like your dick is pulling off a pink cardigan.  Turtleneck.  And let's not forget, go to iTunes for the free download podcast section, Coke Logic animated. 
[02:41:00]  One of the classic stories that Patrice told about, it's...  It's cold out here.  It's cold out here, whatever.  Cold out here, yeah.  It's animated and you can download it today.  And those podcasts or those shorts, the ONA shorts doing very, very well.  Coke Logic is great.  Thanks to everyone that's checking that out and downloading it and spreading it around for us.  Okay.  Before we go to break, can I say congratulations to our friend.  Did we mention that?  Who had a baby? 
[02:41:30]  Who had a baby?  Ooh.  Wait.  Who had a baby?  Wait.  Who had a baby?  He's a very good friend to us.  Who had a baby?  Oh, yeah!  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Elo had a kid.  Yes.  Eric Logan and his wife had a new baby.  A bouncing baby boy.  I got the wonderful pictures.  What was the baby?  I thought it was a girl.  I don't know why I thought that.  I thought he had a daughter.  Maybe I thought he has a daughter.  Yeah, okay.  That's why.  Hudson. 
[02:42:00]  Hudson.  He spells his kids' names a little strange.  I don't know.  He doesn't mean to.  He's just, like, drinking when he writes on the press certificate.  Speaking of names.  I wonder if he looks at the videotape and sees what he named his kids.  Yes.  Wow.  What did I do?  Hudson's a good name, though.  Yeah.  I was watching Juno, and then, like, Tom had to, like, stop me as we were leaving the  other joint to say, oh, you like Juno?  I liked it, too.  Me and my wife went.  And blah, blah, blah.  The character development of them.  I was like, oh, my God.  I got to get to the other place. 
[02:42:30]  But there was a scene in Juno.  I don't know if I can do it justice.  Never mind.  It's about baby names.  There was this yuppie couple.  And they were talking about names of babies, and they're like, well, have you thought of  a name for the kid yet?  And the yuppie couple, the typical yuck type of people that think they're, like, a little  hipper than everybody else, but in reality, they're not.  And this was a big joke in the movie.  He goes, well, we're thinking if it's a girl, it's going to be Madison, which is the basic 
[02:43:00]  name of some douche that's trying to be different until their Madison goes to fucking preschool,  and there's 10 other Madisons in their class because they were trying to be different, but  they're not being different.  I'll think of the poor people listening right now with a daughter named Madison.  But do you get the, this is what they were basically saying with this scene in the movie,  right?  This douche behind me, because, you know, I had to go to a movie theater on the Upper West  Side where it's just filled with douches, even though we live there, Jimmy. 
[02:43:30]  He knows.  Jimmy knows.  But it's a nice area, but the people suck.  Sure is.  All of a sudden, this yuppie behind me, whatever, this mother, and I want to say what he really  was, but let's just say a yuppie.  All right.  He went to the movie with his little daughter and goes, all excited.  That's what I was thinking of naming you.  And I want to turn around and go, do you understand this movie's making fun of people like you,  you idiot?  Nothing on that?  No, I'm agreeing with you.  I'm just laughing at what it was that he wanted to say. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah.  And it sort of fits the title of the movie.  Maybe.  Yeah.  But I couldn't believe the irony of that.  I'm like, you idiot.  They're making fun of people just like you.  So maybe at this point, you shouldn't be all excited where everyone around you could  hear that you might have called your daughter this name that they're making fun of.  And it would have been great if he heard what her name was.  If he's like, that's what I was thinking of naming you, Piss Flaps. 
[02:44:30]  I almost called you Madison.  But congratulations to Elo and his wife.  Yes.  A second baby.  We were going to break up another thing.  And we've talked about this a million times.  So I go to see Juno, you know, because the girl wanted to see it.  And I'm glad it went.  It was a really good movie.  This was one she had her eye on, right?  And we were bored.  It was Sunday, I guess. 
[02:45:00]  And it was like one o'clock in the afternoon.  I'm like, I'm thinking to myself, how many people would go see Juno?  Sunday, one o'clock.  We get to the movie theater.  There's a line out the door.  So we go to the convenient ATM ticket machine.  Oh, yeah.  Why would you ever wait on a line for a movie ticket when you just throw your credit card in and you get two tickets at a second?  Yeah, it's out your tickets.  I don't know if every theater has this yet, but they have them here in Manhattan at a few places.  And everyone was going to see Juno.  And it's my biggest pet peeve.  I don't go to the movies, you know, and sit in these fucking crowded theaters. 
[02:45:30]  It drives me nuts.  And we squish in like all the way next to the wall.  The theater is packed.  And I'm sitting there like, why in the year 2007, because it was still 2007, I'm like, why in the year 2007 do we have to fucking sit in movie theaters still?  I can't comprehend this.  Especially there's a market out there where you throw it on the cable and say you could watch Juno for $20, $30. 
[02:46:00]  There's a market out there.  People would pay $30 fucking dollars to see a brand new movie instead of sitting in a crowded theater.  I'm like, why are we still sitting in crowded theaters?  The home systems are way better than anything they, you know, they show you in theaters, except for IMAX or IMAX, whatever the fuck they call it.  I always get that wrong.  IMAX.  IMAX.  But it looks dated.  The movie sounds dated.  The sound isn't as good as you could get in most systems that most people have now.  It's not that expensive to have a nice little system in your home with the flat screen TVs and the high def and the, you know, digital and all that. 
[02:46:30]  We'll get there.  Why are we still sitting in fucking movie theaters?  Don't tell me.  And then I'm, and then I'm trying to like logically think about this.  I'm like, is it for the experience of watching a movie with others?  It's like, no, you don't like these people suck.  And I'm sure they think I suck.  It's part of it because they can charge per person there.  It's just a simple dollars and cents.  If you, even if they charge 30 bucks at home, a lot of people wouldn't get it because they would just be watching with their wives. 
[02:47:00]  They couldn't afford it.  And the ones that could would get fucking 10 or 15 people in there or a bunch of people to watch it and they would, and they would tape it and there'd be no DVD market.  It's probably the piracy issue also.  And then Miss Selfish behind me had to take her flu to the crowded movie theater.  And I'm trying to be better.  I really am.  As much as I tell these crazy stories on the air, I really am trying to be better.  I, once again, had to bite myself because I want to turn around and go, why are you coming to a movie theater if you have the fucking flu? 
[02:47:30]  Yep.  Coughing and sneezing the entire time.  Where now I go like this.  I put my shirt up, hoping this is going to stop some of the germs.  Yeah, I don't understand.  I decide to play fucking bank robber in the middle of the movie.  Yeah, I don't think that works.  And then I'm like slumping down in my seat like this going, well, maybe the cough will fly over my head.  Fly over your head, yeah.  Get the person in front of me.  Show them.  Why do you have to be that selfish?  I know people have to go out about, you know. 
[02:48:00]  Not when they're sick.  No.  Not to the movies.  Stay home.  Not to the movies.  Maybe your job, you don't have a choice, whatever.  But like a movie theater?  Come on.  What the fuck?  Keep your outbreak at home.  What the fuck?  Germ-filled messes.  But they are starting to throw some movies on DirecTV or whatever.  What is it called?  Pay-per-view?  On Demand.  On Demand.  Thank you, Thanh.  On Demand.  On Demand.  But they're basic like IFC crap movies. 
[02:48:30]  Every once in a while they'll pop one on and say you can get this before it hits theaters.  But it's never something you want to see yet.  Something new that I think they started on Cablevision out there.  You can go through the little menu and there's DVDs and you can buy it right there and watch  it immediately and then they send you the DVD.  Like if you have a movie you want to buy and own it.  Really?  You can watch it and then they send you the DVD.  Wow.  That's great. 
[02:49:00]  Where's this at?  A Cablevision.  Oh, okay.  But they're also going to...  Oh, my God.  Was it Apple or iTunes?  I was reading over the...  Did a lot of reading over the break.  Oh, yeah.  Where they're saying that you're going to be able to download movies now.  Yeah.  But they're going to go away.  Like you get it for...  You can only watch them for so long.  You get it for a certain amount of time.  Self-destruct.  Which that technology is just amazing.  How the fuck did they figure that out?  But then can we take our nice high def fucking video cameras and really get a nice copy before  it goes away? 
[02:49:30]  Get a bootleg copy.  Just videotape your screen.  Videotape your screen perfectly though, right?  Think about it.  You can set up something nice to get around that.  A little bootleg copy.  But that idea is even better.  So you get the DVD.  It's sent to you in the mail.  Yeah.  Well, that's probably the iTunes way.  It will protect the DVD market.  I mean, that's probably how they...  It is brilliant.  They're always trying to stay one step ahead of fucking...  On Demand sucks a big fucking piss hard on.  It's better than not having it.  I'll tell you why.  And this is...  People are going to laugh, but whatever. 
[02:50:00]  But they can relate in their own way.  I didn't hear you.  I'm sorry.  I'll hear you during the replay.  It was a stupid dick joke I made.  I was getting into the Christmas spirit.  And I'm like, you know what?  I don't have a lot of Christmas movies.  I have like the typical one, like Christmas Vacation.  And I have like Elf.  Caligula.  Yeah.  Downfall.  Right.  Right.  But I don't have like...  I was actually looking for like Bad Santa and a couple of these others that I haven't really seen.  I'm in the mood. 
[02:50:30]  I'm like, I got a Christmas tree.  It's getting close here, right?  So I go, you know what?  On Demand, they must have Christmas movies.  It's the Christmas season.  Yeah.  Couldn't find one, bro.  Maybe one.  But there's a reason why they don't have them on Demand during the holiday season.  What is that?  They didn't make a deal with the...  Because they know people are going to go out to stores and buy those movies?  Oh, so you buy them instead of just rent them.  Why wouldn't they have a ton of Christmas movies on Demand around the holiday season?  Why?  To get into our pocketbooks. 
[02:51:00]  Yep.  Our purse strings.  We got into our purse strings.  But what is the real reason about that?  Because they want you to go to Best Buy and actually buy the movie, you think?  I'm thinking so, yeah.  It was unbelievable.  You probably just...  Yeah, they probably...  Everyone would just watch them.  When you buy it, especially a seasonal movie, you're going to buy it and only watch it then.  Who wants to watch a Christmas movie?  Like Christmas with the crunks.  Fucking horse shit was called.  In July.  I know where you're going.  So the only time that people are going to buy it is then. 
[02:51:30]  But you can watch it on Demand.  Plus you'll watch eight minutes and realize, wow, this movie fucking eats an ass.  And you'll turn it off.  Wow, what's that one where the dad gets all tangled up in the lights?  By the way, I finally watched Spider-Man 3.  How was it?  It was good.  I totally went into the dark Spider-Man character and he was emo.  Yeah, I heard that.  Oh my God.  Dude, chills.  What's his name there?  Crap.  Paulson had like the emo haircut and he had the dark eyes and he's like kind of walking 
[02:52:00]  down the streets of quote Manhattan and he's like pointing at chicks and stuff like he's  uber cool.  It was a douche chill moment in that movie.  Not believable and just didn't work.  Who's Tobey Maguire?  Yeah, Tobey Maguire.  Yes, of course.  It didn't work and they were going, I guess they were trying to get into the emo movement  or something to get these people watching.  I don't know what the fuck they were going for, but it was embarrassing to watch.  The rest of the movie was pretty cool, but that whole thing was stupid. 
[02:52:30]  How is the Sandy character?  The one who's full of sand, that sandy creature man?  Who was he?  We had him on the show.  He didn't church.  Oh yeah.  Thomas Heiden Church.  Oh yeah.  Okay.  We did have him on.  I'm like, holy shit, this guy is rocking, man.  I forgot who we have on the show all the time.  Wouldn't they beat him with a fucking vacuum cleaner?  How hard is it to beat a guy made of sand?  Suckers.  Yeah.  What a shitty villain. 
[02:53:00]  It's wind, man.  You open the window, he goes.  Yeah, it's kind of weird because his sand would just kind of like blow around the streets  and then become hard when he needed it, but then you could like, yeah, it was kind  of a dumb concept.  Fucking awful.  But he did pretty well with the character.  Put a cat turd on him, embarrass him.  He's got a little hat.  Put him in the litter box, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's trying to destroy the world and there's a fucking cat shitting all over his  fucking back and stomach.  But Tobey Maguire in that emo, dark fucking Spider-Man thing was really bizarre. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah, a lot of people didn't like that.  Oh, they saw him way behind.  Yeah, that's a whole thing that people hated.  All right.  Were they doing Spider-Man 4?  I'm sure.  Oh yeah, that franchise is still alive and well.  I'm sure.  What was the best thing you got for Christmas?  Did you get anything good?  Yeah, I got something that most people would be like, whatever, but he was a hero of mine  growing up and my girl got me.  Coincidence.  That's kind of what I got.  Oh really? 
[02:54:00]  Something having to do with a hero of mine.  My best Christmas present besides the bizarre yoga sweatpants with the huge cummerbund.  Yeah.  I mean, if you want to pull these sweatpants down a little bit to look cool, they would  still be above your navel.  Oh God.  Looking cool at the gym.  Oh my God.  Well anyway, what was the coolest thing? 
[02:54:30]  Oh, I got Taxi.  What season?  Because season four will not come out.  I'm so irritated.  Oh wait.  Oh, all right.  I got the first three then.  Yeah, I got all three seasons of Taxi that I'm going to jump into.  I got, believe it or not, I never got this officially Nirvana Unplugged DVD.  Alice in Chains Unplugged DVD.  Which I already had, so I'm going to pass that along to somebody.  I got the Ken Burns documentary of New York City, which is really interesting. 
[02:55:00]  And some clothes.  And a nose trimmer thing.  I think she's giving me a hint.  I think she's basically saying, you know, if you fucking trim those bad boys, you won't  pick your nose as much.  It feels like you got a porcupine in your nose for a week.  Eat that, you're sneezing.  Dude, I was driving home from Long Island yesterday and I was picking my nose in the  car and my girl turns to me and goes, what are you doing? 
[02:55:30]  I go, I'm picking my nose.  And I was trying to get away with that.  Thanks for announcing it.  Is she calling you out on it?  You saw that I was picking my nose.  You could have looked out the window and just let me be, but you had to say it.  Now we both know I was picking my nose.  Well, let's play devil's advocate.  Look, I haven't got the batteries yet for the nose trimmer, but now I'm going to nose  trim up and I'm going to pick less.  Pick less.  Do you understand? 
[02:56:00]  Well, you can't completely stop the habit of picking.  Do you understand that she's a really attractive girl?  Here it goes.  Some would say a 10 and others would agree.  Absolutely.  A knockout.  Yeah.  Smart.  Great look.  Everything.  Funny.  Very funny.  Oh yeah, boy.  She nailed me and my stupid girlfriend.  We were sitting there with our fucking hats on, our New Year's Eve hat.  She goes, Jim, get closer.  I want to take a picture of you and the other idiot in the hat.  She really fucking nailed it. 
[02:56:30]  Oh, damn.  Oh, we laughed.  Can you bring in your New Year's Eve pictures?  Sure.  We got to get them on a website.  Okay.  The ones I got of you and then like they were trying to take pictures of Jimmy and I and  I had my noisemaker.  Jimmy had his ridiculous hat and I have the stupidest blowing of the noisemaker ever.  We have the worst pictures.  Yeah, I'll bring them and I got my new MySpace photo.  My girl took a picture of me eating, but I wasn't trying to be funny and my mouth was  open and I had a hat on.  I'm just a fat necked cunt with food in my mouth. 
[02:57:00]  It was really funny.  But anyways, where were we at?  Nose picking.  Okay.  She busted you.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  You said you got the nose trimmer, so you'll pick less.  Yeah.  Hopefully.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where were we?  I just want to say.  Oh, my best gift.  Oh, you're your best gift.  Yes.  And then the only reason I'm interrupting because then you trump me, obviously.  And that's what we get.  I have to thank.  Which is fine.  But listen.  Somebody for my great gift.  Man, don't give a shit, though.  One of my heroes. 
[02:57:30]  Even a brunt.  One of my heroes growing up was Pete Maravich.  Mm-hmm.  And I went to his basketball camp.  I met him.  I got his autograph and stuff.  But Lindsey got me a canceled check.  Pete Maravich.  Maravich canceled check.  Nice.  And I don't collect memorabilia for the most part.  But this is something that's like, wow, this is really cool.  Brings me back to my childhood.  Blah, blah, blah.  I was big time into basketball with a picture.  It's really nice.  That was my best gift.  What was it, too?  What was the check written out, too? 
[02:58:00]  I haven't seen it yet.  Costitute.  It was sent to Philly.  The Philly crew has it right now because fuckers didn't deliver it in time for Christmas.  Bastards.  But they finally have it down there and they're sending it up.  And I'm sure it's not a fake.  No, why wouldn't it?  I mean, remember, people...  It's like that one time I saw the Babe Ruth autographed baseball in the blue marker that  they, I'm sure, were selling in 1917.  Never get ripped off by and there.  Wow. 
[02:58:30]  She should have called me.  I would have talked to her.  He spells it wrong.  You know what?  It's an average with two Vs.  I got you beat.  I got a Babe Ruth autograph on an aluminum bat.  Ah.  Hey.  One of a kind.  Anthony really got something cool, though.  No, I did.  I did.  My part was just a setup for Anthony.  See, what Anthony just did there was he actually asked me a question, like, make him believe  he actually cares about me and my life, which he doesn't.  It's trying to acknowledge that in a way.  No, I wanted to know if you got something good that you did.  I think you wanted to know. 
[02:59:00]  He was serious.  No, you didn't.  No, you didn't.  I really did.  Because you knew what you were going to trump me with.  No, no, no trumping.  I was just very excited about it.  You never asked me a question about how I'm doing.  Never.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  What did you get, Anthony?  I'd like to know.  Well, one thing I got that was just wonderful is it's a big, big, thick book.  It's called Hitler and His Generals.  And it's transcriptions of all the talks between Hitler and his generals in the war room. 
[02:59:30]  And it's just a day-by-day account of the war in all their own words, because Hitler  insisted on getting stenographers in there after a while, because he kept getting his  generals saying, like, well, no, I wasn't clear that you meant this or said that.  So he went, all right, I'm getting stenographers.  Every word that's ever said is going to be written down now.  So it's just some stuff is just really simple nothing, and other is like major battle planning. 
[03:00:00]  But some of the things you think Hitler was involved in doing things, there was one thing  that was written, and a couple of his generals are saying that they have the panzers ready,  but they need fuel.  And Hitler just says, so without the fuel, the panzers will not run.  And you read this and just go, this guy's an idiot. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  What a blithering idiot.  He's making a proclamation.  Yeah.  Ah!  So what you're saying here.  But then Buddy and Jen out in Colorado.  Can I stop you for one second, though?  Yes.  Would you actually read something like that?  I have been.  It's amazing.  Will you go cover to cover and something like that, or you just kind of browse it a little  bit?  Occasionally, I'll probably skim a couple of pages, but for the most part, yeah, maybe  a couple.  Like, I'll look and see what they're talking about.  Whenever I see something about a final solution, I don't know. 
[03:01:00]  You got to see what that guy was thinking when it comes to that.  You're all in.  I'm all in.  But anyway, I'm sorry to interrupt you.  Interesting.  Go ahead.  But, and then Buddy and Jen got me probably one of the best gifts ever.  What?  The 1938 German Mauser.  Jesus.  The, yes.  The gun.  What's a Mauser?  A gun.  Yes, the rifle of the German soldier.  And God knows what this thing did. 
[03:01:30]  It's got a couple of, let's say, unique markings on it.  It's, you know, a couple of stamp marks on the bottom of the barrel.  How many dents?  A little eagle and swastika that he's sitting on.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  How many dents?  Oh, I was looking at the back end of this thing.  The front end, you know, is usually the business end.  Oh, the back end of this thing, just a big hunk of metal on the butt that you know was  just used to crack noses open with.  Wow.  But very, very cool.  Very excited. 
[03:02:00]  I'm going to.  Does it still work?  Yeah.  Fully working.  Can you actually go down to the range and shoot that off?  Yeah.  Really?  It's.  That's your next video.  It's amazing.  Now I just got to get whatever the Japs were using back then.  What the hell were they using?  Small condoms.  And then I'll have my World War II and then some kind of Soviet piece of crap.  Weren't they known for having the blades on the end of their guns? 
[03:02:30]  The bayonets.  I call it the little blades.  They all do.  Yeah, they all got it.  But then they start that thing.  And the Mauser's got the bayonet attachment and stuff.  That hand-to-hand shit back then.  Pretty cool.  Scary monsters.  All right.  But then in my office, I'm going to have a wall dedicated to World War II rifles.  How great is that?  Do you have any American?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, of course.  You've got to have that.  But I got a lot of rifles.  The video of you doing donuts, are you going to post that one? 
[03:03:00]  I'll post that one when I finally have the courage to watch the whole thing.  You haven't watched the whole thing yet?  No, actually, the battery was kind of dying on my thing.  Oh, wow.  You're off battery.  It's dying.  When we get back, Steve and Sam present The Mad Scientist and Epstein.  Epstein, episode one.  And we got sexual pleasure.  The breasts.  We also have a little tease for tomorrow.  Another member of the Opie and Anthony show got engaged.  Yes.  We'll talk about that tomorrow on the show. 
[03:03:30]  All right.  But first, these messages from our fine sponsors.  What?  Your sponsors?  I don't know.  I really don't know what they do when we say something like that.  I don't either.  I have to make a wee-wee.  Oh.  Do you have a piss heart on?  No.  It's fucking...  It's shriveled right now.  Like a fucking...  It looks like one of Stalker Patty's teeth with a head on it.  A fleshy tooth.  A chiclet.  A little chiclet with a head.  I almost had a penis off in FH Riley's, by the way, because some guy was talking shit. 
[03:04:00]  And I'm like, all right, let's go.  Wow.  Yeah, Paige.  That's...  One of Brett's boys.  I don't know if it's gay if you have like a cock-off.  Let me show you this.  Now, you beat this.  He was trying to say he had like a show where I'm like, yeah, whatever.  And then we started zipping down our pants and then people around us were like, you know,  what are you doing?  Yeah.  There's cameras around here.  What are you doing?  Brett does have cameras up.  I'm trying to convince him to like throw one or two online now. 
[03:04:30]  He should.  So people can check out FH from their...  From their...  The goings-on.  From their homes.  All right.  We'll break.  Opie and Anthony.  The breast is one of the most sensitive of a female's erogenous zones.  The reaction of the female, the sexual stimulation, especially in the regions of her breast,  are unbelievable.  Whip-a-Mail Wednesday.  What the fuck was that? 
[03:05:00]  I have another resolution.  I'm trying to do less crutchy things.  So I was ready to go into my, yeah, we're back on the opening Anthony show on XM Sound  on radio.  And then I realized my New Year's resolution.  So then I went, ah.  I don't think welcome back to the show is crutchy though.  It's boring and who gives a shit.  People know what they're listening to.  It says it right on their radio. 
[03:05:30]  It's like they're welcoming us back though.  The reason you used to say your show name, using some of my radio education, was so people  would write it down in an old diary.  But at XM, you don't need to do that.  And the show name is right on the fucking radio itself.  So there's no real reason to ever say the Opie and Anthony show, especially when you're  exclusively on satellite radio, which will be merging with Sirius Radio in the very near  future.  Will it?  I hope so.  That's my info.  That's my thing. 
[03:06:00]  Hey, I got to tell you, we took what?  Almost two weeks off and Sam is downright frightful now.  Oh, it is amazing.  You guys might not remember, but we started something called Afro Wars with Ron and Fez  or the staff of Ron and Fez.  Ronnie has not even acknowledged that we attempted to do something between the two shows.  But the people behind the scenes are taking it very seriously.  Yeah.  And Sam is growing his Afro and still trying to insist that he's not black. 
[03:06:30]  It is a great, great Afro that he has.  But he made some major strides with this Afro in the last 10 days.  This thing has sprung, man.  This thing is wild.  Yeah, you are one of the homeboys.  Are they still in Afro Wars over there on that other show?  As far as I know, I know they're still on vacation, so I would hope that Eastside Dave  has kept his regimen up.  Yeah.  But when he left for Christmas break, he was not in competition with me, so I doubt that 
[03:07:00]  he's coming back with anything.  I like the headphones are actually indenting your fro.  It's amazing.  You're Juan Epstein.  It's starting to take shape.  We made a deal with Sam that he's allowed to shave it at the end of February for, what  are we calling it?  We're not calling it Black History Month.  We're calling it...  Sam History Month.  Well, not Sam.  Like an eighth of Sam History Month or something like that. 
[03:07:30]  One 16th of Sam History Month or something.  Too bad your last name's not Bo.  I think we're going to win Afro Wars.  Oh.  Did you ever doubt it?  And by the way, we've got to acknowledge, like, Than and I had an awkward moment before  vacation, because I go to Than...  Piss hard on?  One.  Sorry.  I go to Than, I go, Than, that beard is getting awfully full.  And he goes, Afro Wars.  I'm like, oh.  I didn't know that he was...  I thought he was just growing a beard. 
[03:08:00]  Kind of weird Afro on your chin, is what you're doing.  He's like me.  It's kind of, you know...  Yeah.  I can't get any bulk up here, so...  So you just go with the...  Yeah.  The Southern Hemisphere.  You can really get a good beard going, though.  That's like movie, stranded on an island beard that you got going there.  Thank you.  I was reminded...  Thank you.  I go back to the Ken Burns documentary on New York City, and they're showing a lot of  footage from, like, 1902, like the late 1800s. 
[03:08:30]  Good old days.  And I see a lot of, I see a lot of fans walking around.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Pops called me a Civil War general.  Okay.  There you go.  Yes.  A Civil War general.  You definitely got that going on.  You could play that part.  He looks like he's from another...  We would ruin it for you so you wouldn't get it.  Lee, lee.  Lee, lee, lee.  That's the short part.  He looks like he's from another era with that, right?  Yeah.  We should, like, dress you up as a Civil War guy.  Or he could actually also be one of the knights of the round table.  Yeah. 
[03:09:00]  You have that look where if you were wearing some kind of a knight armor thing, it fits.  I'll start updating my headshots immediately.  Yes, please.  So it's obvious we're going to win Afro Wars.  Yeah.  It's so obvious.  We've got a ringer here.  We've got a ringer.  Well.  Something else that ends the same.  Are you going with the beard until Sam shaves?  Yeah.  That's another month.  That's, like, almost two more months.  I could do that easy.  But that could be a great photo for your radio show. 
[03:09:30]  Nice.  I'm serious.  Even better than us in front of the Washington Monument?  That's a real good one.  Wow.  You guys should do what the Beatles did back in the day.  Like, what was it?  Break up.  Get shot and die a brain cancer.  Marry a one-legged bitch.  Yeah, what the fuck happened to these guys?  You're right, Jimmy.  What was the Beatles album where the front cover, they were all clean cut and stuff, and  then on the back, they were all, like, crazy hair and beards and things. 
[03:10:00]  Oh, no.  That's what you guys should do.  I bet it sold a lot, though.  Anyway.  No, that was actually their worst-selling album.  It was called Beatles' Tuscadero.  What was the name of the album?  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Oh, she gave me a good one, too.  I said something, and she went, B-double-O.  She's mad I'm ripping her boo off on the radio.  Too bad.  Don't be so funny, bitch. 
[03:10:30]  Why are we with women that just make fun of us?  We respect that.  That's what we're going to do.  Oh, does she fucking smash me?  Yeah.  Yeah, really good.  Ugh.  There's a reason I brought in Sam.  Mm-hmm.  Just to, I want to acknowledge the Afro is looking really good.  Yeah, it's really looking good.  And I'm thinking of a new contest, and I thought I had somebody that was going to do it.  Uh-oh.  But he informed me that it might not be in his best interest to do this, unfortunately. 
[03:11:00]  Mom!  Mom!  I'm kind of bummed.  And that's all I'll say about that for now, but it will be revealed at a later date.  What's the contest?  You know I'm a big fan of Biggest Loser?  Dumb show that, uh, where fatties lose weight?  Fatties, yeah.  I want to do, with someone, should we do it with Ron and Fez's show?  Yeah, I think Eastside Dave would be a good candidate.  You think?  Yeah.  I want to do the Biggest Gainer, and I got $500 cash to the person that wins, and if Ant or anyone else wants to jump aboard or sponsor, whatever, this could get very interesting. 
[03:11:30]  But I will guarantee $500 cold cash.  And I'm trying to find someone on the Opie and Anthony show to gain as much possible until, uh, spring.  Three months.  From, like, right now.  So, like, right around April 1st, April 2nd, whatever.  You got the, you got the idea.  It's a long time.  A long time.  And I want to take on someone from Ron and Fez, and we weigh you guys in, like, once a week.  And the guy who gains the most fucking weight in three months will get my $500 cash, whatever Ant wants to throw in. 
[03:12:00]  And I'm sure we'll get some sponsor as a goof, like Bodog or somebody, to throw in money.  But we need a member of our show.  I can't gain weight.  No, I'm not looking at you, but we would lose if it was you.  Yeah, I know.  We need someone like the E.  Someone that really has a problem keeping weight off.  E-Rock is shaking his head, like, oh my god, don't.  What do I win? 
[03:12:30]  Exactly.  All right, let's discuss this, E-Rock.  Is there a chance?  No, there's no chance.  Why?  Wow.  No chance.  Health issues?  No, not so much health issues as in a living situation, possibly.  How much did you put in on over the late holidays?  At least 15, it's obvious.  I don't know.  I was sick much of it, so.  Oh, shit.  That's fucking sick.  Is it the scale? 
[03:13:00]  No, I'm not doing the scale again.  How much did you gain in the scale?  Why not?  I don't know what I started at before the vacation.  You were sick the whole holiday?  Yeah.  Poor baby.  What kind of sickness?  I had a 104 fever and strep throat and a sinus infection.  Jesus fucking Christ.  I hope it's gone.  The strep throat and the infection is gone, yeah.  Good.  So you still have the fever?  Yeah.  Once in a while.  What about the urge to be? 
[03:13:30]  Once in a while.  What's wrong with you?  You are sickly.  Once in a while.  You're sickly.  Once in a while because like sometimes I'll be sleeping and then I'll wake up freezing  and then I'll wake up later on in the night and I'll be like soaking wet from sweat like  the fever comes and goes.  Fix your fucking thermostat.  Exactly.  Yeah.  There he is.  Did your mom purposely... 
[03:14:00]  Have any children that lived?  Did your mom purposely make you sick when you were growing up?  Like that Munchhausen syndrome?  Are you one of those kids?  Proxy syndrome?  Which you had to stick things up your poop chute to see what your fever was.  Just to get sympathy she tried to kill you like fucking in a sixth sense.  Gave you the super Drano in it or some shit.  You're like a little fat Misha Barton.  Puking in a tent. 
[03:14:30]  I had a minute question.  So you're out?  Yeah, I'm out.  Fuck.  Do we have anyone on staff that's willing to do this?  Danny will do it, I'll bet.  And Butcher just volunteered too.  Let's have an arm.  But doesn't Butcher have abs?  Yeah.  No.  Jesus.  Butcher does not have abs.  Abs.  Not even a hit.  Butcher looks like he's in shape.  He has flabs.  That's what I was getting at because we call him like superhero and stuff.  Dude, Jesus Christ.  Lamb of God.  Right on, bro.  He just has a fucking, you know what it is?  He has a square head.  So he looks like he's in like superhero shape. 
[03:15:00]  He's a Shazam shaped head.  Are you willing to take on someone from Ron and Fest?  Yeah.  Fuck, why not?  Three months.  April.  Yeah.  I'm an eater.  I like food a lot.  Who would do it from their show, you think?  Dave.  Hopefully not Lily.  That guy can't really.  He's not Lily.  Dave's going to be a big, fat, hairy mess because of all these contests.  Well, can we?  I say we get as many guys from our show.  Well, that doesn't make him a bad person. 
[03:15:30]  Oh, wait.  Let's go to Turtle from Wackbag.  Turtle.  Hey, buddy.  Hey.  Sounds like E-Rock's having hot flashes like a post-menopausal woman.  Yeah.  E-Rock's going through menopause with that description he just gave.  No kidding, man.  Very good.  Happy New Year, bro.  Happy New Year to everybody.  By the way, instant feedback.  If you're writing today on this end of the show, I wouldn't know.  I just read an instant feedback that said, have a great vacation, faggots. 
[03:16:00]  And I thought it was someone that was just dumb, and it turns out that's from the 26th  or something like that.  Wait.  He wrote it on the 26th.  I just realized that.  He is dumb.  How heavy have you been?  I've been about 190, and as much as I try and shake it, I'll go to the gym, I'll run,  I'll do whatever, and nothing helps.  What are you now?  Probably 190, 195.  So this is the heaviest you've been in your life?  Nah, I've probably been about 210, I guess. 
[03:16:30]  I've never been huge, but I was always a chubby kid.  How many pounds do you think you can gain in three months?  I'll just keep eating and eating.  It's not a problem.  You don't give a shit?  You gotta eat shitty food and everything.  I have chocolate for breakfast and dinner and shit.  I'm horrible.  I'm a mess.  Dude, are we in or what?  I'm ready.  Which is in?  That'd be cool, man.  Who else on staff wants to do it?  We could have more than one guy on our side.  And we should have two guys, in case no one from the Ron and Faye show wants to do it,  we should still have the concerts of people here. 
[03:17:00]  What about Danny?  Will Danny do it, though?  I don't know if Danny will do it.  Who else do we have?  We got fucking Bird's Stomach.  He ain't doing it.  No.  Bird's Stomach.  No, I'm talking about Steve.  Danny comes sauntering in.  Danny, it looks like you're not in.  I can tell.  I would do it, but I really just want to get in shape for once.  I was just like, you know what?  I really should hit the gym and just do it.  And Danny is part of Afro Wars.  Yeah. 
[03:17:30]  I'm doing all right, I think.  Sporting.  It's not bad.  The curls aren't as tight as Sam's.  He just needs a haircut.  Actually, it's more like you got a Kramer thing going on.  It's rocking.  He's doing something.  All right.  So we got Butcher.  That's good enough.  Anybody else?  Who else we got?  Who else works for us?  Who's Jarrett?  Who's Travis?  Travis is not going to gain anything.  Jarrett would be great.  That leaves Derek.  He'll be fat at 140. 
[03:18:00]  Derek can't.  I wouldn't.  Not to Derek, just to the fact that he can't gain weight like we would want him to.  We got work in here.  Jesus.  All right.  We got Butcher so far.  There's much little tiny people here.  You need like a big fat bastard.  Don't start eating yet because you can maybe lose a couple pounds.  It's the trick.  For the weigh-in.  For the weigh-in.  We're going to have a weigh-in.  Oh, man.  So right now, you've got to be on your best behavior until it's game on with these clowns  that do what? 
[03:18:30]  Noon to three?  Yeah.  On 202?  On Monday, I think.  Okay.  All right.  So we'll figure it out.  But so far, we got Butcher for our biggest gainer.  I'm in.  Biggest gainer.  And we're going to take this to the other side of the show, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what we'd do.  All right.  I thought he was in some kind of shape.  The guy fakes it really well, man.  And it's like, every time I take off my shirt in front of a girl, I must think how terribly  embarrassed I must be for myself.  Oh, because they're probably expecting something really good superhero-ish. 
[03:19:00]  What do you see you got?  Ugh.  Not even that.  The man tits.  He's jiggling.  That's horrible.  You're a deceptively fucking mess.  I'm trying to look good if I want to put it.  Deceptively.  He had no problem when we were nicknaming him superhero and all, right?  Please give me a little credit.  Jesus.  Able to leap a fucking tall plate of pancakes.  He's in.  Who do you think they'll pick over there, though? 
[03:19:30]  I don't know.  That fucking pepper dude's a mess.  Yeah.  Pepper's a mess, right?  Now that we've seen what Butcher has to offer, I'm pretty excited with our chances.  That's a good foundation to turn into a fat fuck.  Basically, we're saying you're a mess.  Big fat ass.  I don't know.  And how old are you?  I'm 24.  All right.  That's a problem.  That's a fucking problem.  Yeah, but you can gain a lot of weight at 24.  Yeah.  Bronx Johnny, he's not far from being a disaster.  But I mean, by the time you cross over 30...  I'm going to be looking like E-Rock. 
[03:20:00]  You're going to be a fucking wreck.  Like, you're just going to be fat.  Like E-Rock.  Oh, I love you, E-Rock.  E-Rock looks like you put on a couple pounds for the holidays.  He did.  You know, the holidays.  E?  E-Rock, did you put on a couple?  Probably did.  Yeah.  What was your poison?  I was calling myself the truffle kid all holiday.  I couldn't stay away from the chocolate truffles.  I like the truffles. 
[03:20:30]  I'm a fucking loser.  What were you eating too much of there, E-Rock?  It was not of one thing, but we were dining out a lot, so...  Yeah.  Dining out a lot.  Was your girlfriend kind of...  Trying to make it sound fancy.  Yeah, exactly.  Like it was an accident of his success.  Dining out.  So, Eric, did your girl...  Because your girl wanted you to get in shape.  Did she comment every time you'd eat a dessert?  Come on.  Yeah.  No, not about the...  Dining out.  Would she say things like, God, we need to stop doing this? 
[03:21:00]  Yes.  Meaning you need to stop doing this.  You could probably eat better dining out.  Stop with the dining out!  Then you could...  When you pick numbers to eat, it's not dining out.  No.  It wasn't fast food.  It was actual restaurants.  What kind of desserts were you having?  I'm not a dessert person.  All right.  Yeah.  Of course.  So, it was a lot of Italian food.  I think Friday's was in there one day.  Friday's.  That's not a restaurant.  That's not dining out. 
[03:21:30]  Friday's.  If your waitress looks like she's from the Girl Scouts, it's not dining out.  Merit badges with your fucking...  Wearing onion from orc suspenders.  Right.  So, what would your girl say to kind of discourage you from...  What would your girl say to you from eating?  Pretty much, she would just look as I was eating anything.  And she goes, we really need to stop doing this.  I like we.  We. 
[03:22:00]  She's in great shape.  She's in perfect shape, and it's we.  We're in this together.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And...  I can see it when you look down.  Like, when you look down.  Oh, yeah.  You look kind of like Shakespeare, except you're wearing, like, a fleshy thing.  It's your neck.  You know what I love about Iraq?  He is so ashamed of his own eating, but he can't help himself.  Oh, no.  It's tough, man.  It shows up first in his chin, though, too.  But there are people that...  He really gets that. 
[03:22:30]  It's awful.  Dude, this is what I'm trying to say, though.  There are people that will overeat, and they're fat or messy, whatever, but they don't give  a shit.  And that's...  Whatever.  That's fine.  But with Iraq, he does give a shit.  Sure.  And he's ashamed of every fucking bite he swallows.  Iraq, does that blow up to help you find a mate?  Well, we would be dying down every night.  I mean, she ordered the truffles, and I just sat there and ate flies.  Why did I have to say truffles?  Because you said truffles.  Yeah, the truffles.  Who orders truffles? 
[03:23:00]  Because you want to be part of the truffle kid.  Crew.  Truffle kid crew.  Kid crew.  Oh, E-Ross.  I tripped and you fell on the...  Oh, my God.  There it is.  All right.  I've made an ass of myself.  And everyone else.  All right.  So there you go.  I'm sorry, Eric.  Butch is in.  I got 500 so far.  That might go up there, Butch, in the coming days.  I'm cool with 500, Butch.  We got to see what everyone else does. 
[03:23:30]  Cool.  You get a girl?  Hell no.  Not with a buddy like this, man.  Yeah, that's true.  Share it.  Yeah.  Pat fucking Duffy, too.  Yeah, let's not forget.  He's not here today, so.  No, he's in training right now for the weigh-in.  No, I meant for Eric.  Oh, E-Ross.  Can you come in here?  No.  We did.  Come on.  We just want to see.  I think it's fair just to see.  We just want to see.  Yeah.  It's fair to see where you are.  Not a big deal.  You might have only put on three pounds, you fucking silly goose.  You'll feel better about yourself, maybe.  Exactly.  And I'm sure Travis is going to run in with his notepad that keeps track of this shit. 
[03:24:00]  Oh, great.  It doesn't work.  Oh, it works.  No, it works.  It's true.  It's trying to pretend it doesn't work.  I'm going to poke it with a stick.  E-Ross was talking about dieting.  Oh.  You see, he doesn't look that bad.  You take your clothes.  You do.  You're going to add in weight by the way the pants is.  Wait, he doesn't look that bad.  Exactly.  Except from the neck up.  Like, below the neck, you look fine.  Although he's learned that dark.  No, but I'm saying, like, under the neck you get a little bit.  He's learning that dark colors hides a world of hurt. 
[03:24:30]  Oh, and he's coughing.  What the hell is going on?  That was part of my Christmas present.  Pretty much most of my wardrobe is gone.  Oh.  And has been replaced.  Oh.  Wow, she threw out those M's and picked out some L's.  Ew, you got new underpants, too, obviously.  Wow, these are old.  Jesus.  I don't know what's in there.  Why did you insist on taking your pants off?  With a fucking cheeseburger in his fucking underwear.  How's the sleep apnea?  It's better. 
[03:25:00]  Are you wearing a mask?  No.  What are you doing?  Nothing right now.  I have another appointment on Friday.  E-Rock looks like he's not, he didn't gain any weight.  He might have.  How much was he last time?  I have no idea.  I think it was $1.99 when the, uh.  Yeah, it was very close to like a shower.  Come on.  Look at Travis trying to be casual.  I think.  You got a fucking notepad in front of you.  Well, somebody needs to keep track of this stuff.  All right.  All right.  Here he goes.  That fucking Anthony Perkins hairdo of his is really buggering. 
[03:25:30]  It doesn't matter what he does to that hair.  I love that.  It doesn't matter what the fuck he does to that hair.  Jimmy will always have a character.  Anthony Perkins.  That's the most bizarre hair ever.  Oh, that's great.  It looks like a toupee, but he has all his original hair.  It's, uh, 207.2.  Ooh.  A little bit, but that's not that much.  Yeah.  35 less than I predicted. 
[03:26:00]  Yeah, but he lost weight because he was sick.  So 208, he's probably about 215.  Yeah, you were sick too.  That's like when people lose fucking weight.  All right.  Why pay attention to, to E-Rock when we could talk about the mad scientists and Epstein?  Steve, that's what I want to say.  Uh, it's, it, the mad scientist.  Where's Steve?  Yeah, we need Steve because this is a collaboration.  Oh.  This was actually, I would say the credits would be, it was created by Steve.  Created by?  Created by Steve C.  Written by Steve and Sam. 
[03:26:30]  And voiced by Steve and Sam.  Steve and Sam?  No, I said Sam.  Oh my God.  I said Sam.  We heard it.  You have a way of, uh.  It's amazing.  A guy fucking just has a verbal slip up and we can't get to him fast.  But Sam?  Jesus, what assholes.  What the fucking pricks we are, I know.  And also for the record, it's pronounced Epstein.  Epstein.  Epstein.  Oh, okay.  That's different.  Yeah.  Anyone else creeped out that Steve grew a full beard in less than a week?  A little bit.  No. 
[03:27:00]  Well, I already had most of it.  I just had to grow it in a filler.  You didn't have a beard?  No, I had, I had the sideburns and the Fu Manchu.  The rest of it was just.  It's fucking creepy that you could grow it that fast, though.  You should see what's growing out of my ears.  Oh.  I got the, uh.  I know.  What the fuck?  Got hair growing out to your ears?  It's awful.  I think it's the Rogaine.  I'm not really sure, though.  Oh, really?  I don't know.  I mean, I'm trying.  I got, I'm getting thinner.  You're using Rogaine?  I'm, I'm trying anything because I'm getting that frigging, you know, my, uh, grandpa  on my mother's side fucking spot up top.  All right.  So you're popping Rogaine on there? 
[03:27:30]  Absolutely.  And I don't know if it's, if it's, I have no idea.  It's going out your ear.  Yeah, I don't know if it's coming out my ears and not on my head.  Does the Rogaine work?  I'm just thinking that, not that this is with you, but maybe, maybe the hair is falling  off that part of the head because all those men's hands.  I'll tell them to push more gently. 
[03:28:00]  Bunch of guys walking away from trucks, stop shaking their hands, hair falling off of  their head.  Fucking kid wear a hat.  Wow.  Does the Rogaine work?  If, I think, I think it actually works in, in, like, in, in terms of, of hindering the  process from it, like falling out more because I haven't lost any more, but, you know, in  terms of growing more of it, yeah.  I hear as soon as you stop using it, then it starts falling out again.  I fucking hope not. 
[03:28:30]  That's one of the problems.  Oh, that's what they say, no, it's true.  It all flies out.  I hope not.  Rogaine is glue for your skull.  No, you have to use it forever, they say.  Really?  Or else, yeah, or else when you stop using it, you'll just fall out.  Yeah, that's great.  How do you put it on?  It's just, it's like, it's like, out of a cock.  It's like mousse, you gotta rub it in your hair after you take a shower.  You can't put it on, like, if you, if you can't, you can't have anything else in your  hair.  You can't have, like, gel and shit.  Why you got hair coming out of your ears?  Because I'm a fucking hairy Lebanese-Italian mess. 
[03:29:00]  With genetics that rival that of a fucking ape.  I mean, look at this shit.  I shave my arms every other day, and I've got, you know, growth coming out like this.  Why would you shave every other day?  Because I'm narcissistic and vain.  I do a shave down every once in a while, but.  You are like, I never noticed, like, how much of a chore that must be for you, all that  hair.  It is awful.  It's just constantly trying to trim back something that's trying to engulf you.  Yeah, exactly.  It's like trying to. 
[03:29:30]  You're like Geordie Verrill in Creepshow with the fucking grass growing on him.  It's like bushwhacking through the Amazon.  It's really, I don't like body hair, but I've been cursed with a lot of it.  He's tired of trackers making, like, white casts of his footprints.  I really don't have that big feet.  All right.  Well, we got the mad scientist in studio.  And Epstein.  Epstein.  What's this about?  Epstein.  Stam.  Stam.  Fuck it.  What was Stam? 
[03:30:00]  Stam.  Stam, how much of a setup did you already give him?  I just, nothing.  I mean, I just gave him the writing credits.  Just the writing.  Okay.  Think of the Professor and Beaker from the Muppets.  That would be a good way to, you've got a professor who's really a genius, who thinks  of these, he's a scientist, not a mad scientist, but he thinks of these inventions that would  solve the world's problems.  Like, but he only makes one of them. 
[03:30:30]  He's sweet and naive.  He's sweet and naive, and his assistant Epstein is well-spoken, particularly well-groomed, and  as far as the way he's dressed, he wears half of a Captain Caveman outfit that's a little  too short on him, very snug.  Another homoerotic Ramon bit.  And spends his time, and Epstein spends his time sitting Indian-style on the ground. 
[03:31:00]  Epstein!  Spends his time sitting Indian-style on the ground, picking up his massive testicles  and dropping them, repeatedly.  I was thinking over break.  Let me jump in here.  I was thinking maybe we should start preparing more for this radio show, and after hearing  the last two minutes, I think we're just going to stay the course.  Well, let's give it a listen. 
[03:31:30]  It may be, uh...  I know, I know.  Sometimes it's how you're going to describe that.  Yeah.  You know.  All right.  Anything else you want to add?  I don't understand why he'd pick up his balls and drop them, but...  Well, Epstein, as well-spoken as he is, he has certain problems that causes him to focus  on his two favorite hobbies, which are playing with his testicles, and the second you'll  probably figure out by the end.  The second you'll figure out by the end.  This is the debut, so I'm not saying...  Debut sometimes.  The first episode of season one of some of the most popular shows on television. 
[03:32:00]  We're awful.  We're awful, but then people just kind of grew to love the characters.  Sam and I have committed to making more of these.  I think we're about six episodes, maybe a purchase of six episodes.  Wow.  Six episode run.  By the way, his feedback is finally working.  Tyler from Columbus writes, what a mess.  Did Steve's dad shoot turnbuckles off of wrestling rinks?  A George the Animal Steel reference.  Yeah.  Nice.  All right, here we go.  The Mad Scientist and Epstein. 
[03:32:30]  Epstein!  Epstein!  Look and see what I've concocted.  This conveniently sized apparatus will transform any ordinary tap water into a combustible fuel  to be used in automobiles.  It will revolutionize energy consumption as we know it.  Please handle it gently.  It's the only one of its kind.  Quite impressive. 
[03:33:00]  It's most compact.  Perhaps it would fit in my hiney?  No!  Epstein!  No!  No, Epstein!  No!  It's pointy!  It's just one of a...  Oh, don't pull grease all over it!  It's going in!  Epstein!  It's almost there!  It's in my hiney! 
[03:33:30]  Right.  Back to the drawing board, then.  Oh, Jesus, no.  What the fuck was that?  You do realize you're gay, right?  Wait, where's the testicle dropping?  Yeah.  How did that get...  Well, that was part of the setup.  It just hasn't been revealed yet.  I'm just giving you a character background.  Who he is as a character. 
[03:34:00]  What was the thing that he was putting in?  Mein Heine?  Mein Heine?  It's German.  I see that.  I got it.  I forgot.  They're German.  No, not both of them.  No, not both of them.  Not both of them.  Epstein is...  I thought it was very funny.  How come they both kind of sounded German?  Yeah, we got to work on the...  Jane Doe from Jersey, you know, this is almost as good as Hey Masturbator, so...  Hey!  You guys might be on or something.  I think it was a hit back when Macarena was...  Shut up.  Who said Hey Masturbator? 
[03:34:30]  What the fuck is this?  That was an old song parody.  Oh, we don't...  We don't know, Jimmy.  Don't acknowledge that.  Was it awful?  Steven S. from Bayshore writes,  Wow, and I lack the confidence to write more stuff.  I like the hammering sounds.  Yeah, it sounds like you got a sound effect, a bunch of sound effects, and decided, let's  make a bit.  Epstein rules.  That's what he writes.  And he writes more.  So...  Some people are really loving it. 
[03:35:00]  I have to pee again.  Epstein.  Right.  Epstein.  You just keep smashing the inventions.  That's right.  Yeah, by trying to pound them in your ass.  Yes.  I'm getting that that's the whole thing.  These are his two hobbies.  Every time you make one-of-a-kind prototype invention, you will try to pound it in your  ass.  I'm thinking if you're like a brilliant scientist, and your first invention gets shoved up your 
[03:35:30]  assistant's ass, you might want to get another assistant.  Because while he's brilliant, he's sweet and naive.  Right.  He loves Epstein.  That's funny.  That's the exact character flaws he'd need to keep him around as a character.  Right.  Yeah.  Wow, this was thought out.  Okay.  He just keeps giving Epstein the benefit of a doubt that maybe this time...  He won't shove your prized possession and invention up his ass.  The reviews are coming in like crazy.  Steven S. from Bayshore writes, that Ep... sucked. 
[03:36:00]  Well, hold on now, Epstein is brilliant, but sweet and naive.  Yeah.  They sound like the qualities that some dummy actually believes he possesses in real life.  Needed to grease it up and...  Well, yeah, he's constantly...  He's next to him while he's sitting in the installs, a large paint can that's filled with  lard.  Oh, okay.  He rubs that on his testicles, too.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Where are you guys going to be picketing today? 
[03:36:30]  What do you mean?  Riders strike.  Riders, yeah.  We're not actually in the guild yet.  Oh.  Yeah, we're trying, though.  If that doesn't get you in, nothing will.  Next stop.  All right, we're going to take a break so Jimmy can pee.  Yes.  And then we're going to do sexual pleasures, the breasts.  Pleasures.  The anus was such a hit, we had to go to the breasts next.  Go to the tits.  We'll go to the tits next.  That's what we'd do.  Put it in the tits.  Fatty, hit that.  There's a lovely young lady showing her breasts. 
[03:37:00]  The boob, the boob, the boob.  Get naked.  Chuck them.  Girls all over the country flashing their lovely boobs. 
[03:37:30]  Guess how many boob nights are they?  Can?  I don't have those.  You are spectacular.  Well, me.  Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Wednesday. 
[03:38:00]  Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Wednesday.  and we're gonna do a thing here a thing remember when do you remember when  oh yeah i'm also gonna um see i take like new year's very seriously 
[03:38:30]  my girl noticed that she goes wow you really take it seriously you do a lot of reflecting  and then you like uh really start thinking about what you want to accomplish in the new year i'm  like yeah i've been like that my whole life i'm going to um call all the people that hate me  and record their conversations for the radio show in the coming months interesting how does that work  it's a long list i'm just gonna start with a  and work my way to z hope you have a lot of minutes saved up 
[03:39:00]  boy is it a long list but i'm going to be making some phone calls and will they be confrontational  or sort of patch things up ish um i will go about it with a uh open mind  and see where it goes and then put some of these conversations on the air  forward to hearing that what i'm looking forward to hearing that could be good right i don't mean 
[03:39:30]  the radio i mean your phone call oh yeah hello  why are you calling me remember that bit i was talking oh yeah you're gonna do with it  start with you no this is the call that's terrible uh sexual pleasures uh the brass  some audio that danny found i believe thumbs up thumbs down these guys need credit for everything  so i'm making sure i give the right credit credit where credit's due 
[03:40:00]  nothing and this is more about thumbs up all right doesn't matter that's coming in so we'll just say  it was we did the anus and it was it was quite we did the anus and it was quite funny and the guy  just had a way of uh really making it so not hot unsexy even though he was trying to make it sound  sexy and hot and erotic it was just awful i think how that that's how it was marketed like it was  supposed to be some hot sexy yeah clinical thing you were supposed to watch right uh 
[03:40:30]  so the same guy did sexual pleasures the breast let's get right into it here the breast is one  of the most sensitive of a female's erogenous zones the shape of women's breasts vary in size and  firmness and start to develop at puberty in some cases the female breasts are not equally developed  asymmetrical the glands producing milk fully developed during pregnancy they consist of  clusters of 15 to 20 smaller glands which during that period accumulate the substances from which 
[03:41:00]  the milk is composed each little gland has its own duct which terminates in the nipple the nipple  varies greatly in size shape and color from person to person as does its sensitivity  the oreola surrounding the nipple is dark i love that cookie the fuck is he talking about  the oreola is a small oreo this would have solved my piss hard on problem this guy's awful i heard 
[03:41:30]  yeah huh it just sounds so um the oreola he said the oreola the oreola varies in size  shape and color from person to person as does its sensitivity the oreola surrounding the nipple is  darker in color than the nipple itself the nipple has an erectile reaction to manipulation 
[03:42:00]  especially in situations relating to sex some women can reach an orgasm by having their nipples  manipulated generally speaking the sight of the female breast or contact with it produces a sexually  arousing reaction in the male  i am yeah happy new year that guy is the worst narrator ever ever he is awful 
[03:42:30]  hmm well this next clip he talks about uh all men have their own breast preferences  yes each man has a different preference as to size shape and color of women's breasts  men wise in the ways of making love and definitely aware of the arousal gap realize the importance of  stimulating the female's breast the reaction of the female to sexual stimulation especially in the 
[03:43:00]  regions of her breast are unbelievable blood congestion causes the arteries to pump blood  into these extremely sensitive areas causing them to become even more sensitive and by the time  orgasm has been reached the breast of the average female will have increased by up to 25 percent of  its normal size i actually was more turned on listening to schwartzkopf when he was describing like assaults in the first gulf war  wow this guy's a hoot 
[03:43:30]  uh someone uh oh it's not someone it's our pal pat from manaki pat happy new year  he writes i love the double stuffed oreolas or oreolas right double stuffed oreolas are double the cream  uh inside the cookie  when your bank says no champion says yes 
[03:44:00]  this guy is joseph goryab  is this is that local  i don't know it the new yorkers are laughing at least when your bank says no  right champion says yes yes yes  uh some women use their breasts to make themselves more attractive  sophisticated women knowing well lower breasts have for men go to many extremes to make themselves  sexually more attractive with breast beautifying treatments see how clearly the film shows female 
[03:44:30]  breast enlarged by silicone also see the surgical scars where the silicone and other surgical materials have been inserted  and also note the many shapes of the female breast listed on official list of female breast shapes  used by sexologists and physicians breast shapes such as the bud-shaped breasts the bowl the apple  firm round sagging pier drooping and the voluptuous sexy breast shape 
[03:45:00]  did he say pia pia pia yeah  he forgot the candy corn  and the guys  what about the hershey kiss  but he was talking about those being like ones that guys alike  saggy  saggy droopy  stretched out  chewed out  there is some  that no man finds sexy  sorry  flapjacks  fried eggs  gravy stains 
[03:45:30]  I love the gravy stains  that's one of my favorites  moose noses  moose noses  moose noses  and the cockeyed  the gecko  well we learned in the final clip thank god  that uh women  like to accentuate their breasts  and see how the beautiful models dressed up and accentuate their breasts with sexy bras like the push-up bra and the cup bra and the no bra look bra 
[03:46:00]  and to add more glamour to their glamorous breasts see how one of the very lovely models applies breast makeup seductively invitingly  After all, the breasts have always been sexually arousing to men, and whether exposed, hidden, or uplifted, women's breasts will always be fashionable and a wonderful weapon in the war between the sexes.  Uplifted? Spiritually? Like, motivated? Uplifted by what, a good sermon? 
[03:46:30]  This guy stinks.  A creepo.  A woman's breasts are great to grab after you duct tape her mouth and you're assaulting her angrily.  You grab them until your fingers actually meet through the skin.  Oh, God.  Disgust the police by biting off her oreola.  God almighty, what a creep.  Do we have more of this stuff?  If her breasts are too small to insert your penis in between, hook a fish hook through one and then yank on it until the string makes the breast touch the other nipple around your turgid penis. 
[03:47:00]  This guy fucking sucks.  Oh, yes, flat-sews. We forgot about that.  And the flat-sew.  Flat-sews.  If you don't have lubricant when having breast sex, just use salmon eggs.  The little orange ones that nobody enjoys eating on sushi. 
[03:47:30]  Oh, someone got it, man.  I got, uh, free beer and hot wings from Wackbag.  I hate that radio show.  But anyway, he writes, uh, this breast milk can be used to cure cancers of the head, neck, and abdomen.  And chest.  I know.  He sounds like Dr. Gil Liedemann.  Dr. Gil trying to get fucking autographs from a dying George Harrison.  From pudding-headed George Harrison.  Please sign my guitar.  Uh, anyway, linger longer.  Danny said we got more audio of this, just not today. 
[03:48:00]  That's okay.  I love that guy.  Is he talking about the snitch?  Snitch.  Do you ever talk about the snitch?  He has to.  Hey.  That's ground zero.  Before we get out of here, Doug Stanhope left a message for the show.  Hi, this is Doug Stanhope.  Wishing everybody a happy New Year.  Happy New Year.  Yeah.  This is what he left Steve a few days ago.  Or it wouldn't be a few.  All right, whatever.  Thank you for having me.  Nor should you be around to answer the phone.  It's the holidays, and it's Douglas Stanhope, along with Joby and my gal pal, Bingo, and 
[03:48:30]  the dogs, wishing you a Merry Christmas.  We're tripping our balls off, and we always think to call.  We're playing Dave Matthews with no shame.  Bingo can't talk.  You want to say hi, Bingo.  Hello.  Hello.  That's it.  That's it.  Okay.  Hey, happy holidays and all the best in your New Year.  And little Jimmy Norton, we love him, and we watch him on the television.  We rent the movies because we don't have the entertainment here down in Bisbee, but we do 
[03:49:00]  have occasionally the year's flyer mushrooms, and we do have two hits of acid that someone  smuggled me in a bootleg of some new music, which I don't listen to.  Fathom.  Yeah, no.  We're Fathom.  Where are you?  It's rolling.  Hey, Dallas Cowboys are playing.  Jimmy Norton's team.  All right.  Hey, I love you guys.  Happy New Year.  Thanks for having me.  Yeah, bye.  End of message. 
[03:49:30]  How fucked up is he going?  Thanks for having me.  He's, what, in the machine?  Right.  He called.  He's like fucking Charles Manson out there.  He's like got guns and drugs.  He's got like people with wacky names.  Right.  Hey, bingo, squeaky, fucking.  Right.  He's like frothy, frothy, frothy, he's taking fucking acid and mushrooms, and he's in the  desert in Arizona somewhere.  Ah, God bless him.  What a life that guy's living. 
[03:50:00]  Hey, Ford's attempted killer got out of jail.  Squeaky from.  Squeaky?  Yeah.  Squeaky's out?  Lynette, yep.  Lynette's squeaky from.  You should be happy while we're on break.  You should never get out of jail when you're thinking of killing the president.  When you bring a gun to the president, you should never get out.  They always said that she would get out, but after Gerald Ford died.  Really?  Because they didn't want to insult him.  Really?  Yeah.  Did he just die?  What?  About a year ago?  Not even, right?  It's not even a year yet.  Why, um, 30 some odd years she did in jail. 
[03:50:30]  But did she actually have, someone said she didn't have bullets in the gun or something?  No, she did.  Oh, sure.  From what I remember of the story, the Secret Service guy grabbed the gun and it had a  hammer and he put the webbing of his hand in between the hammer and, uh, the bullet.  Think that hurt?  And it probably hurt like a motherfucker, but it's the only thing that kept the gun from  going off.  That's why it didn't go off.  Why is she out of jail?  I mean, I, at the bottom line, if you pull the trigger on the president.  Yeah. 
[03:51:00]  She found God.  Fuck her.  Did she?  No, I don't know.  I was just.  She was a real fucking manson.  She's still a wacky bitch.  She's got a swastika carved in her head, doesn't she?  Ford died, uh, just over a year ago, the 26th of December, 06.  Oh my God.  What a travesty.  She gets out.  So they waited.  They probably waited.  How old is she?  We'll wait a year after Ford dies and we'll let you out.  How old is she now?  Um.  God, she's gotta be, uh.  I think she's, uh.  Maybe 30, 35 years old.  Perhaps older than that, Anthony. 
[03:51:30]  I'm too tired to come in.  Hee-yah.  Puss.  Um.  I don't know.  What's her age?  I'm gonna guess she's 55.  I would say in her 60s.  I'm gonna guess 58.  I would say 62.  And my second guess is gonna be 61.  I'm working on it.  And my third guess is 72.  You can't think three guesses.  72.  Born in 48.  Oh, okay.  58. 
[03:52:00]  58.  58 will go with.  Thank you.  No, she's not 58.  What?  She's 59.  When's her birthday?  When was she born then again?  October 22nd, 1948.  Oh, 48.  So she's, uh, almost.  52 plus 7?  59?  Oh, we're into the.  She's almost 60.  Oh, we're into the 08.  No, but she's not October yet.  Yeah, she's almost 59.  She's 59.  She's not even close to 60.  She might not be 59 yet.  She is.  That ain't bad.  Sure.  Now she's, you know.  She's out.  Yeah, with a dried up pussy, though. 
[03:52:30]  Yeah, I know.  She loses.  She was probably a goer back in the old Charlie days.  Big fiery red bush.  Charlie was deep-dicking her.  Yeah, it wasn't squeaky from.  When you said that, I was like, that doesn't make sense.  You're right.  It wasn't squeaky from.  Oh, it's not?  Didn't she do another shot at the Ford?  Wait.  It was squeaky from.  Sure it was.  Wikipedia.  Sarah Jane Moore.  Sarah Jane Moore didn't shoot at President Ford.  Squeaky from did.  A little squeaky.  Lynette.  Oh, wait.  I just made up that whole thing.  There you go. 
[03:53:00]  Oh, okay.  Cool.  All right.  We did dancing, Ellen.  God, oh, my.  We fucking get it.  Every fucking day.  And every fucking day.  We have to comment on it at this time every fucking day.  Just as he said his line and you said your line, I'm thinking of my head.  Every fucking day.  Every fucking day.  What a great place for a suicide bombing.  God almighty.  Why Pakistan?  Why not in the middle of this fucking shit storm?  Nothing but ball bearings and nails. 
[03:53:30]  Exactly.  Flying through a bunch of house frows.  No.  Dude.  Bunch of sneakers and long pants.  She gets away with fucking murder.  Half those people have no idea that she is a raging lesbian and she gets to dance and rub  her body up against strangers every fucking day.  Oh, my God.  She's announced it.  Do you honestly think?  I bet you no one knows.  Like most of those people don't know.  Now, do the walk over the table.  Do the walk over the table.  Here she goes.  You know, someday they'll put some kind of a fucking cock there and she won't be able 
[03:54:00]  to do it.  No.  No walk over the table?  Oh, well.  All right.  Sit down.  It's not funny or endearing.  It's just stupid.  Oh, she just gave the old...  Oh, cut it out.  All right.  Enough of this dancing crap.  It's the woman who shot at him 10 days after Squeaky.  Wow.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Maybe they should have rounded them all up.  And then we lost that broad in Pakistan. 
[03:54:30]  Budo.  What is she doing sticking her head out?  I know.  Especially in that fucking environment.  Keep your fucking head in the car.  Head in the car, Dotton.  Is there a video of the shooting?  Yeah.  There's gotta be.  They haven't shown any.  Cell phone?  Is it on like a break or something?  I actually saw it on...  Is it on Breer Breer?  All right.  On the news.  On the news?  Yeah.  No way.  What's new?  An explosion.  Her head exploding?  Well, no.  It's from behind and you kind of hear a bang and then an explosion from point blank.  I don't know how the cameraman was like, cool.  Can we see it then? 
[03:55:00]  I'll look for it right away.  Thanks, babe.  Yeah.  All right.  Why don't we go home?  Amen.  Yeah, we gotta...  I don't feel like doing that today.  I gotta...  I wanna work...  I wanna get back into this work thing slowly, so...  You gotta get into a...  I've been to the gym in a week and a half.  Week and a fucking half.  I've been the chocolate truffle kid, I told you.  Oh.  Gregorio ate too many truffles over the holiday.  That scared me.  Antonio!  Paul.  Gregorio!  That's just me.  What are you, Jimmy? 
[03:55:30]  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Line of the day brought to you by BodogFantasy.net.  Play Bodog Fantasy's NFL playoff pick-em game for free and win a trip to Vegas courtesy  of BodogFantasy.net.  Bodog.  Bodog.  Here's a runner-up line of the day.  Ooh.  Ryan's trying to say he was out of breath because he kissed Dick Clark's wife?  Yeah.  And that got him all, what, hot? 
[03:56:00]  Oh, no, he had to hold his breath so he could kiss a girl.  Starting the new year off right!  Yeah!  I'm good until at least March.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  I can see it when you look down.  Like, when you look down, you look kind of like Shakespeare except you're wearing like  a fleshy thing at your neck.  That's a good one, Jim.  Thank you.  D-me. 
[03:56:30]  Thank you.  And, Jimmy, now because of you, I can't even look at John Edwards anymore.  You're right.  He has a massive fucking skull.  Oh, it's fucking horrendous, that head.  Huge, giant head.  Jimmy's new shit is great.  Thank you.  Jimmy's going on tour, people.  He's going to start playing some big places all over the country.  So, where do they find the tour dates, Jim?  My MySpace, since the website, I don't know what the fuck they're doing with it.  We've been begging.  I'm actually going to look for a new server.  Oh!  I've been enough already with this fucking nightmare of getting stuff fixed. 
[03:57:00]  So, mymyspace.com slash Jim Norton.  We'll have your tour dates.  I think the third Borgata date's actually sold out.  I hear you have a lot booked and you've got more coming.  Yeah.  They just keep coming and coming.  Yeah, I'm doing like Minnesota, Denver, Poughkeepsie, Sanny Franny.  That's what I call San Francisco.  Oh, that's cute.

[03:57:30]  Obama's stuff was funny.  The Edwards, all of it.  Yeah, it's really good.  It's not the same hour from HBO.  That was my goal.  No.  To kind of not give them the same hour.  Because why pay to watch what you just watched?  Pretty amazing.  Why buy the cow?  That's right.  Fast Freddy learned today that...  When you can fuck it while it's eating cud.  Fast Freddy writes from Jamaica Station,  Today I learned, never use Opie's plates.  Ah, very good.  Yeah.  And Greg Brady's leftovers from...  Ooh! 
[03:58:00]  Wisconsin.  I wonder if he's a cheesehead.  Aw, cheesehead.  He writes, Gregorio, Antonio, and Gini.  Fuck, you always have to trump us, you asshole.  I didn't.  You had a nice...  I was totally off guard.  I had a nice bit with my Gregorio,  and then I added a little Antonio,  and then you have to like...  But you have...  What could...  Oh, what could I have done?  Gini.  You had another great show.  I'm so fucking happy to have you guys back.  Well, thank you, Greg Brady's leftovers.  Gimio!  See, there's nothing I could have done  that I would have had emphasis.  I know.  Gimbo.  Gimio.

Love of God.  Holy droolses, beverages, Batman.  Oh, Jesus.  Inside of his head looks like a lava lamp.  That's it.  I think there's another runner-up.  Oh, that's all I want to do.  Oh, okay.  Let's run to it.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, that girl in the front row of Jerry Springer 
[03:59:00]  just bent over.  You see that?  That was a nice little treat for everybody.  You got a nice fucking ass.  Who are watching Springer right now  instead of listening to the show.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  You guys should do what the Beatles did back in the day.  Like, what was it?  Break up.  Get shot and die of brain cancer.  Boy, we piled on that one.  And finally, here is your line of the day, people. 
[03:59:30]  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  Impression.  Oh, my God.  Pop goes the vessel.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Rowan Oak Ridge.  Oh, that's horrible. 
[04:00:00]  Gregorio!  Uh, D-me.  D-me, D-me, D-me.  No, he's saying it wrong.  All right, let's go around the room.  D-me.  And everyone has to do their part.  I'm Gregorio!  Antonio!  E-me.  E-me.  He's the comic relief.  No, I'm the meek.  The day is silent, I noticed.  Of course it is.  So it becomes a watch.  I'm the meek, simple boy. 
[04:00:30]  A meek, yet simple boy.  E-me.  E-me.  And my arms, like, connect, like, the back of my wrists connect.  E-me.  E-me.  E-me.  Fucking retard.  A meek, yet simple boy.  Simple boy.  Boy.  All right.  All right.  Let's, uh...  We gave you guys a lot today, so don't expect too much tomorrow. 
[04:01:00]  Yeah.  Seriously.  Gotta pace ourselves a little better.  Absolutely.  We can all burn out on Wednesday.  We get a peak Friday.  Oh, I'm shaving into a Hitler mustache, and I'm putting it on YouTube.  You should.  That's my new thing.  More videos.  Oh, wow.  What happened?  Is that a new video?  What?  New video?  What?  What happened, Dan?  Yeah, you can see a muzzle flash.  Let's see it.  Where is it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, I thought this was live TV.  This was you checking this out?  Yeah. 
[04:01:30]  Where is this video?  Live leak?  Live leak.  The assassination.  Mm-hmm.  Right there.  That's a different guy.  Or is that her security shooting back?  I don't know.  I think that's her security shooting back.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Holy shit.  Shot her right in the head.  Yeah, but they're saying she didn't die from that.  Yeah, now I'm here.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I can't see shit from that.  I thought that she has a good country. 
[04:02:00]  Country.  Well.  Oh.  Look at this bit they're doing on Ellen.  Yeah.  Another radio bit.  They're blowing a bunch of fucking dollars around a little booth and the man's trying  to pick them up.  And people watch this shit.  Should have put cocks in there from the looks of this guy.  Yeah.  Be grabbing at those.  Look at his mouth.  Hands free.  Look, Ma.  No T-cells.  Oh.  A zinger by... 
[04:02:30]  All right.  I got to go do some screen therapy.  Ah.  Who will fall apart first on the O.P. and Anthony show?  Oh.  That needs another poll.  Why did I say that?  Oh.  Hey, uh...  Ron Ifez is still on vacation, so no reason to listen to that?  Yeah.  All right.  Those Lazy Bums. 
[04:03:00]  Bums.  I'm sure they got some great best of stuff to check out today from noon to three.  Check out the Zeppelin channel.  That's going away soon.  And...  And...  We always have a problem at this point in the show.  We don't know how to end it.  Because we want to end on a big bang.  We need a consultant.  And we realize that our nickname should be the Fizzle Kids.  Can you end the show for us?  And, like, when you say it, you're, like, the back of your hands have to be touching in 
[04:03:30]  the middle of your chest, so it almost looks like your elbows are wings, and your fingers  have to dangle meekly below their hand.  That's how you work it.  That didn't work you.  Nope.  Yeah, you got it.  Yeah, I was doing it.  I don't want to do that.  All right, I'm sorry.  No, no, you're putting...  You're being...  You're half-assed.  You're putting your hands away from your body.  Your hands have to actually touch your chest, and they go down meekly. 
[04:04:00]  Eee!  Eee!  Eee!  Eee!  Eee!  Eee!  Eee!  Eee!  Eee!  Eee!  Eee!  Eee!  Eee!  Eee!  Eee!  Eee!  Eee!  Eee!  Eee!  Eee!  Eee!  Eee!  Eee!  Eee!  Eee!  Eee!  It's just idiocy, this whole show is just idiocy.  It's nonsense.  They're gonna wake up and just kick us off the air already, so we can retire.  What are you waiting for?  It's so obvious.  All right. 
[04:04:30]  How about this?  How about we just say goodbye and like a...  Like how?  Like a buh-bye, gang.  No.  No?  I thought that would have done it.  Okay.  Eee!  Eee!  Eee!  Eee!  Steve, what do you got?  I'll show it to Jimmy.  What is it?  Who?  Is it sound good?  Mm.  Oh, fuck yeah!  Yeah?  What?  Oh, I mean, that's up to those guys.  Yeah. 
[04:05:00]  All right, let me see.  One of the best actors on television.  I fucking love him.  Absolutely not!  No!  Let me see.  Oh, the stars of the wire.  That fucker is good.  Hey.  Oh.  Let me see.  I don't know.  I saw two no's.  No, that's not a no.  Anthony just thrown it at you.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  Hey, this is how we end it.  This is how I'm going to end it, because I appreciate the positive listeners out there. 
[04:05:30]  We got Matt Lafar from Queensbury.  Yes.  We all know Matt Lafar from Queensbury.  Queensbury.  He wants us to wish him a very happy 39th birthday.  It was on New Year's Eve.  Oh, cool.  So happy birthday to Matt Lafar, the big three nine, and happy New Year to everybody.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Bye.  Turn our mics on!  You're not ending with the...  Don't play this.  No!  No!
