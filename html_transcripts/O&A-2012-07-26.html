<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a discussion of the 2012 London Olympics, focusing on humorous and controversial news stories.  This included a Greek athlete's racist tweet about African immigrants, the South Korean flag mix-up that angered the North Korean women's soccer team, the perceived over-sexualization of women's volleyball, and the sexually suggestive interpretation of the Olympic logo. Opie also shared a story about injuring his toe. The conversation then abruptly shifted to a Dollar General manager beating a burglar with a baseball bat (sound effects included), a multiple shooting at a Harlem basketball court, and the media's disproportionate coverage of the Aurora, Colorado movie theater shooting versus Kristen Stewart's infidelity.  The hosts used copious vulgar and offensive language throughout this segment, and discussed James Holmes' courtroom demeanor, speculating he was faking mental illness, and briefly touched upon their views on the death penalty.  The show then reviewed the movie *Lockout*, discussed Chris Rock's *Two Days*, and Chris Rock's comedic take on gun control and the high cost of bullets.  The show concluded this section with a discussion of Mick Jagger's birthday and a comparison of the Rolling Stones and the Beatles. Sam, the sound engineer, provided sound clips and online information throughout.

The next segment began with graphic comments about Helen Mirren's age and body. This transitioned into a highly offensive critique of the "Posse Vec" erectile dysfunction device, followed by derogatory comments about aging women and their perceived lack of sexual interest.  The hosts then ranted about pet peeves: annoying pharmacy customers, slow self-checkouts, lengthy phone calls during customer service, and counting out exact change. They also unleashed a vulgar tirade against the SiriusXM app and its customer service.  A significant portion involved encouraging listeners to flood the Midas Muffler Twitter account with inappropriate and sexually explicit tweets.  The show briefly mentioned upcoming guest Pat Cooper, Black Sabbath's tour, and played a George Carlin bit about credit cards.  The segment concluded with a discussion of an intern dressed as "Uncle Paul," and a vaguely described sexual encounter involving the intern.

A caller, Rob, then recounted a sexual encounter with a woman dressed as a pedophile for Halloween, providing graphic details of the encounter.  The hosts joined in with sexually explicit commentary, speculating on the veracity of the story.  A picture of the woman and her friends was shown, leading to further sexually explicit comments.  Jimmy Norton and Anthony Cumia then performed a sexually suggestive and offensive parody of the Penn State fight song referencing the Jerry Sandusky scandal.  The hosts discussed "repurposing" audio, and moved on to a discussion of the worst celebrity endorsements, followed by a comedic interaction with a collections agency representative.  Finally, Pat Cooper joined the show.

Pat Cooper's appearance spanned multiple segments.  His discussion covered his career, contrasting past ambition with present contentment; his disdain for an unnamed wealthy "bully" who underpaid employees; and his negative opinions of certain comedians and television personalities, notably David Steinberg.  He shared numerous vulgar anecdotes from his childhood, show business experiences, and observations on modern society, including a story about bedbugs in the subway and a negative restaurant experience. He frequently criticized the lack of appreciation for genuine talent in the entertainment industry, discussed his hearing problems and difficulties with modern technology, and promoted his upcoming shows with Robert Klein and Susan Essman. The hosts interacted with him, often interrupting but letting him dominate the conversation.  They discussed his book and an underpaid show employee.  Later discussions focused on Cooperâ€™s frustration with the entertainment industry, his negative views on certain personalities, and the perceived decline in comedic standards. A picture of Kirk Kerkorian and his much younger wife was discussed.  The segment concluded with continued promotion of his shows and further discussion of his feelings about the industry.

Further segments with Pat Cooper featured more rambling and unstructured conversations.  The topics jumped between childhood memories (reading comic books, his father's political views including Mussolini), career anecdotes (working with the Jackson 5), and strong opinions and criticisms of various people and situations.  He mentioned upcoming shows and his website.  The hosts and Cooper engaged in banter, often interjecting jokes and personal observations.  A significant portion involved the hosts reacting to Cooper's loud and rambling style.  A recurring theme was Cooper's intense dislike of Howard Stern and David Steinberg, with the latter dislike stemming from a five-year-old grudge whose details weren't fully explained. The hosts expressed exhaustion from Cooper's lengthy and energetic performance. The segment concluded with photos and the hosts' commentary on Cooper's personality and the show's end.  Profanity was frequent throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning. Welcome aboard.  Enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, yes. Good morning, everyone.  Hello.  Yes.  There it is.  Come on.  Everyone's talking about the Olympics.  The Olympics. Yes, yes.  I guess we got to talk about the Olympics.  What'd they do? They'd probably lift the little torches. They'd run off. 
[00:00:30]  They'd do this and that.  They'd do this and that, a little of that.  And they'd march back into the stadium. They'd say goodbye.  A couple weeks later, yeah, it's all done.  And they'd go back to not giving a fuck about most of those events.  Right.  When was the last time you saw any of those events?  Four years ago, I guess. Maybe a little bit.  And you know what?  Yeah.  You're speaking for the majority.  We make believe we care every four years about these events.  You know, they do these events all year long. 
[00:01:00]  Yes, they do.  But no one cares.  After the Olympics, they go back to doing it and no one watches.  You know, people do really, really well in everything but don't quite make the Olympic team cut.  But, like, they're known in that circle of track and field and stuff.  But no one knows who the fuck they are.  Nah.  I wonder why that is.  Eh, no one really cares.  Maybe they're, yeah.  It's when you challenge the world on this Olympic stage. 
[00:01:30]  We were just talking about that Greek athlete who has been banned by the Olympics or the...  Oh, no, by Greece.  Or, okay, by Greece?  Yeah.  She tweeted a dumb joke.  Yeah.  I think she's a far-right political views, too, because she had been kind of lining up, I guess, with this place, the views of the Golden Dawn.  They were kind of an extreme right party.  Mm-hmm.  This was her tweet.  She wrote, with so many Africans in Greece, the West Nile mosquitoes will be getting some home food. 
[00:02:00]  See?  West Nile.  African.  Being Africa.  Mm-hmm.  And, yeah, so they'll be getting some home food, like, because the Africans are there.  Thousands of negative comments.  Yeah.  And at first she went after them.  She's like, you know, hey, that's how I am.  I laugh.  I'm not a CD to get stuck.  And if I make a mistake, I don't press the replay.  I press play and move on.  Like, there you go.  I like that.  But her attitude, they say.  Taking responsibility.  Taking responsibility.  I like that.  Changed Wednesday, and she posted five apologetic tweets in less than two hours. 
[00:02:30]  That's because she probably got the message already, like, hey, they're pretty pissed.  And then she's like, ah, panic mode.  Apologize, apologize, apologize.  Well, that's the fake apology thing to save your ass.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because no one's going to save your ass for you.  Right.  I have changed my opinion on that.  I'll say it again.  She writes, my dream is, like, she said she was sorry and wrote a bunch of them.  My dream is connected to the Olympic Games, and I could not possibly participate if I  did not respect their values, meaning our human rights and stuff. 
[00:03:00]  Right.  Therefore, I could never believe in discrimination between human beings and races.  First of all, yes, you could believe in discrimination, because the Olympics, first of all, are discrimination.  Yeah.  You're discriminating based on national borders.  You're competing against people only based on the country you live in.  So it's not a hateful discrimination.  Right.  But, of course, it's a little bit of it.  Yeah.  That's all bullshit.  She said, I'd like to apologize to all my friends and fellow athletes who I may have  insulted or shamed.  The national team, as well as those people and companies who are supported by Athletic 
[00:03:30]  Career.  And she was yanked.  And then, of course, the Democratic left statement, who I guess polled her, said, let  her make her miserable jokes on social media while watching the games on TV.  Oh, man.  What a fucking cat.  She apologized.  That should be good enough.  And it seemed like she explained herself pretty well there.  And that's what Greece should be worried about.  Oh, wow.  Look at that leg of men.  Whoa.  What's going on there?  That's the start of a pussy. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, boy.  That's where it starts.  Isn't this country defaulting and fucking going to the toilet financially?  Yeah, yeah.  And that's what they're worried about.  Yep.  Yeah.  That's good that Greece is worried about that.  And the rest of the Greeks, I guess no one's thinking up for her right to say something  stupid on Twitter?  Well, it's going to...  What kind of rights do they have over there?  Yeah, the Greeks.  Reverend Al called them, those Greek homos.  Yes, Reverend Al did.  And now he's trying to sell us the Brooklyn Bridge, I guess, on TV.  Something like that.  That's a hilarious spot, Reverend Al. 
[00:04:30]  Oh, Reverend Al.  His MSNBC spots are nothing but hilarious.  Complete bomb.  And they show that dumb promo every morning before we start on MSNBC.  Yuck.  I got something else to sell you.  And then it pans out.  It's the Brooklyn Bridge.  Oh, that's terrific, Al.  How long ago?  How old is that fucking bit?  I don't know.  Sell you the Brooklyn Bridge.  He's a fucking clown.  He's a fucking clown.  Yeah. 
[00:05:00]  So the Olympics have begun, I guess.  They started the soccer.  Oh, boy.  Even though the opening ceremonies are tomorrow, I guess, right?  That's the way they'd start the games.  They got a lot of games to play, Anthony.  Oh, is that it?  Geez.  They got a lot of games to play.  Ah.  And they need more than two weeks to, you know, get that whole tournament in.  Over there in England.  Yes.  Jolly old England.  Yes.  As the Olympics.  I guess the women's soccer team.  Oh, boy.  They came from behind and, I don't know, they did something. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  Good for them.  What happened with the flag mix-up?  Oh, that's great.  Yeah.  That was the other game, right?  Flag mix-up.  The flag mix-up is hilarious.  I guess the North Korean soccer bruds were playing, and I don't know, they show something  on the screen, or they lowered the flag of the team that's playing, something like  that.  Maybe you could help me out there, Sam.  And they put up the flag of South Korea.  Oh.  So the North Korean ladies there said, well, fuck that.  We ain't playing now.  Did they end up playing? 
[00:06:00]  Because I don't care enough about soccer to follow that story through.  I heard they waited an hour to come out.  Really?  Yeah.  They pulled an Axl Rose.  Here, get to that headline again, Sam.  North Korea Olympics flag flap women's soccer team refuses to take field against Colombia.  They get that upset about the flag being...  Well, it's North Korea, South Korea.  That's a rough one to mix up.  Which one do they put up?  They put up...  South Korea.  And of course...  The South Korean flag.  Oh, the North Koreans...  The South Koreans probably would have come out and played the North Korean, but the North 
[00:06:30]  Koreans have to answer to fucking Kim Jong-un.  And they were arresting...  Oh, they must have fucking shit themselves.  Of course.  We can't play.  They have to show national pride.  Because after Kim Jong-il died, they were, I think, arresting people for not grieving publicly  enough.  Yeah.  Is that all true, you think?  Oh, yeah.  They're a terrible country.  How do they check for that?  The video.  The video they saw of people.  That's a wild country.  How do they check to see if you're not grieving enough?  I don't know.  They just stare at your eyes and see how many tears you're producing for a minute? 
[00:07:00]  Oh, yeah.  They see a minute fucking, like, really freaking out, or you're just kind of standing there,  a little somber looking.  Man.  Yeah.  That's some brainwashing.  Oh, hell yeah.  Hell yeah.  Good.  Terrible country.  So, opening ceremonies tomorrow.  And then everyone's talking about the women's volleyball.  They're going to do that at night, for ratings' sake.  Oh, yeah?  Women's volleyball at night.  Why for ratings?  Oh, so people can watch, yeah.  Well, they know people want to see some nice, tight asses.  Oh, of course.  See?  They're like, you know, let's save that for fucking prime time. 
[00:07:30]  See?  They know the prime time sports to play.  Oh, that should be good, too.  I might check a couple of those out.  I think I'll check you out.  Volleyball.  Yeah.  And, uh...  I don't know.  Maybe some Phelps.  Yeah?  Yeah, because, I don't know.  Let's see the synchronized swimming.  He's going to have a tougher...  Exciting.  He's going to have a much tougher time at these Olympics than the last ones.  Why is that?  He's a bit older, and then you've got that...  That young, uh, that young, uh, buck in there. 
[00:08:00]  Upstart?  Yeah.  Is there an upstart?  An upstart that's been in his shadow for a while, and he's basically saying it's my  time to shine.  Oh, dear.  I don't know his name yet.  But that's the beauty of the Olympics.  By the end of the Olympics, you're going to probably know his name.  Oh, maybe, right?  You're going to know some of these people's names.  Is he American?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's the only way we'll know his name.  Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.  We don't really care about the other people that win from other countries, right?  Right.  And then I like that Jamaican runner, that sprinter bolt.  I like that the logo, I saw it on Twitter, it looks like Bart Simpson being blown. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, you saw that?  Yeah, yeah.  Yes.  It really does.  Have we talked about this yet?  Being blown by, uh, Lisa, right?  By Lisa Simpson.  Doesn't it?  Yes.  It's, there's Bart, and Lisa's on her knees blowing Bart.  Yes.  That's a terrible logo.  It's horrible.  I don't even know what that logo's supposed to mean.  What is it supposed to be?  It's just stupid shapes, but.  Some artist that's too cool for the room, I guess.  Yeah, that's exactly what it is.  Like, what is it supposed to be? 
[00:09:00]  Someone's asking for a link.  You can't find this stuff?  Google Olympic logo 2012.  Oh, my God.  You fucking idiots.  Are you tired today?  I'm tired today.  I'm fucking.  I gotta be completely honest with you.  I didn't, uh, I didn't do a nap yesterday when I got home.  No.  Because the weather was so nice.  I just went right in the pool.  And, um, and then, yeah, it's amazing how you can kind of almost, well, kind of injure yourself 
[00:09:30]  a little bit.  Yeah.  I was, uh, going from the, uh, yard up the little, uh, stairs to my slider, uh, sliding  glass door, and, uh, and, uh, it was almost a toe stub, but the, you know where, like,  your toes attached to the foot, the underside, that pad, the front pad?  Right.  Slammed it into the top of one of the steps, the cement steps, as I was just walking.  It hurts so bad right now.  It feels like I'm walking on a softball. 
[00:10:00]  It, it, it, it might have cracked it.  Nah, I pushed around and stuff.  It didn't, it didn't, like.  You did some prodding?  Yeah, I did some prodding and twisting and, on all that sort.  That's, you know, I, I could help you out, because as a father, I do a lot of prodding.  Do you do a lot of prodding?  I mean, uh, a lot of parents grew late when your kid, like, you know, fucking does something  stupid.  Yeah.  You gotta do some prodding and bend the shit to see if he screams.  Bend it, see if he freaks out.  Because he can't tell you yet.  Oh.  So you gotta prod to see how bad it is.  That's hilarious.  You want me to prod? 
[00:10:30]  Nah, I prod it.  You're good?  I'm good.  I'm good.  You're good?  I just, it, it made me think, like, you never, you don't realize how fucking fast your legs  are swinging forward when you're walking.  Right.  Until you slam your foot into something.  Then you're like, damn, what am I doing?  Running here?  You might have bruised a bone or something, maybe.  I fucking just.  You're still feeling it.  Well.  It's the bottom of what?  The, uh.  It's like, like, like, right here.  Under the toes?  It went in, like, bam.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, like, right underneath, like, I just went, bam, slammed it. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  It fucking was so, and, and I'm just limping around now today.  That sucks.  Yeah, it'll go away, but, uh.  I didn't, uh, I didn't cry, Daddy.  I didn't cry, though.  It hurt, but I didn't cry.  Um.  Jesus Christ.  Uh, we're getting info.  The logo's supposed to look like letters from the word London going left to right, top to bottom. 
[00:11:30]  What?  Exactly.  L?  That's the reaction I was hoping.  Who the fuck sees that in there?  Yeah, what are you talking about?  Wait, wait, wait.  Left to right.  The logo is supposed to look like letters from the word London going left to right, top to bottom.  Oh, I see it.  What do you mean you see it?  London.  It's left to right.  If you look, if you look at top to bottom first, it won't work.  So what do I do?  Just gotta go left to right.  I am going left to right.  Oh, Jimmy got me.  You got me on that one. 
[00:12:00]  Let's see.  What the fuck?  Where's the O?  The big fucking Lisa head?  I don't see jack shit.  Stupid artist.  Stupid fucking artist.  Stupid artist.  L?  You see it, Danny?  Oh, that guy's wrong?  Of course.  Okay.  Why?  You gotta stop listening to these people.  No, it makes for good radio.  I will always listen to these people.  It's 2012.  Always.  Right.  That's the year.  That's when the Olympics are.  Right.  Go across.  It's 2-0.  Oh.  And then on the bottom, 1-2. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, that's stupid.  That is fucking written in what they call retard.  Right.  No one makes a zero with two fucking rectangles.  Wow, that's really stupid.  That's terrible fucking love.  Terrible.  It's Lisa blowing Bart.  Nice thing.  Who decided I was good?  How bad were the rest of the...  Oh, man.  They must have stunk.  Yeah, this was like...  This was nothing new.  I think this was...  The story hit like almost two or three years ago when the logo first came out.  I don't remember what I did yesterday, Danny. 
[00:13:00]  I'm sorry.  That's a stupid version of 2012.  Wow.  Yeah, it's been criticized since it came out as being terrible.  2012.  Is it true our athletes are wearing berets and shit?  Oh, they just look terrible.  Why would we wear berets?  Don't we usually wear the cowboy hats?  Yeah, they went with this French faggy beret thing.  They got tired of the cowboy hats, which is more American than the beret.  Yeehaw.  Even though most of the country doesn't wear cowboy hats.  Sorry to the south.  But it's like the beret, it really looks bad. 
[00:13:30]  It's stupid.  How about U.S. Olympic uniforms?  They're a little tight.  Wait, what's that about?  Sam, he's putting in U.S. Olympic athletes.  Oh, I said Olympians.  Well, what is that?  Why don't you just go to images?  All right, let's see what happens.  Oh, he's, see?  It comes up with a fucking picture.  That's terrible.  Sam.  Why are our athletes going to look so, they're going to look fruity.  That does look terrible. 
[00:14:00]  They look like cops from Jamaica.  That's like Cleveland.  Yeah.  That looks horrible.  Yeah.  Who was it?  Big designer?  What was it?  Calvin Klein or something?  Ralph Lauren.  Ralph Lauren, one of those guys?  Yeah.  And, I don't know.  It doesn't look very, very...  The berets are horrendous.  Masculine.  I don't know.  All right.  Oh, we got the 10-10 wins bat story.  Oh, a bat story.  This is great. 
[00:14:30]  Is it John Montone?  Unfortunately, it's not John Montone.  Oh, damn it.  No, I don't know what John Montone was doing today.  He gets to do one story a day.  Yeah, I heard John Montone's story today.  You did?  I don't know what it was, though.  How much do you think he gets paid to do one lousy, on-the-street news story a day?  That'd be fucking 10, 20 bucks.  Let's hope that's monthly.  Listen to this story.  The manager of a Dollar General store in Oklahoma City hit a home run against crime the other night 
[00:15:00]  using an aluminum baseball bat to take out a burglar who smashed through the front door of the closed store  and was trying to steal DVDs.  The manager was on the phone with 911 at the time.  Listen for the telltale ping as the bat makes contact with the suspect's head.  Oklahoma City, 911.  And that's the sound of the crook hitting the floor.  Horatio Coates, described as a serial burglar, was taken to the hospital  and then charged with two counts of second-degree burglary. 
[00:15:30]  You hear the ping.  No charges were filed against Moe Howard.  That fucking made a great full-contact sound.  Speaking of which, you know, you've been talking about this Three Stooges movie.  I had the remote.  I had buy.  All I had to do was hit fucking okay.  And I couldn't do it.  I don't believe this movie's as good as you're saying it.  Well, I'm not saying it's because, see, I never said it was really good.  I saw the preview again, and I'm like...  I said it made me laugh.  Yeah. 
[00:16:00]  A few people have seen it since you talked about it, and they said it's not that bad.  It's not too bad as far as the comedy goes.  It's pretty good.  And my doorman, Steve, who loves bootlegging.  Jesus.  Why would you say his name?  I don't give a fuck.  I gave him the Three Stooges DVD because I was never going to watch it until Ant said what he said.  Yeah.  And he told me, hey, I saw the Three Stooges that you gave me.  You know what?  The movie was pretty damn good.  See?  So now I don't know.  I don't know.  It really... 
[00:16:30]  The trailer does not do it any justice.  Now what throws me off on this movie is seeing the Jersey Shore kids.  That's the worst mistake they made, because that will date this movie.  He's just terrible.  Yeah, he did, right?  He loved that part.  He wanted to go snook it all over town.  Yeah, he did.  I don't think I did.  Larry Moe and Snooki is what he said.  No!  Ron Ron Juice?  Yeah, he loves that.  He likes the Ron Ron Juice?  I couldn't tell you what they were doing.  Here's the ping of the baseball bat again, because I know you want to hear it again. 
[00:17:00]  And that's the sound of the crook.  Ah, well, that wasn't it either.  Hold on one second here.  Listen closely, you get to hear the ping of the fucking baseball bat hitting this guy's head.  Then the scream, and then the thud of the body.  Makes contact with the suspect's head.  I'll call the city 911.  And that's the sound of the crook hitting the...  Ah, fuck you.  That's the sound of someone thinking they're dying, by the way.  He fucking got wailed in the head with an aluminum bat. 
[00:17:30]  Wow.  Which probably ban aluminum bats now.  Well, you have to.  Was that a legal aluminum bat?  Ah, yeah.  Wasn't it an illegal aluminum bat?  It was an assault bat.  Wasn't it an assault bat?  Yeah, yeah.  A machine bat.  A machine bat.  That's not good.  Yeah, very bad.  Very bad.  You should start banning basketball games, apparently.  Why?  What happened?  Another shooting.  Five people on a basketball court in Harlem yesterday.  I guess it was over a...  Something very important, like a bad call during the game. 
[00:18:00]  Was it?  Yeah.  Was it really?  Yeah.  Was it some kind of league, or was it a pickup game?  Yeah.  Five people get shot.  Fucking games.  Wow, that's scary.  And, yeah, they just start shooting.  And, meanwhile, you know, that kid was shot during a dispute at the basketball court.  There seems to be a lot of basketball court violence going on these days.  They got the guy who did it, too.  17-year-old, who the neighbors say is just a piece of shit.  Piece of shit.  Well, you know, Jimmy, you can't just throw away every life.  I'm sure he has some redeeming qualities that could probably come out with the right kind of treatment and mentoring. 
[00:18:30]  And just throw him away.  Put him fucking...  Do like the Spartans did.  Just throw him off a cliff.  Yeah.  They're fucking defective.  Yeah, of course.  Of course.  Yeah.  I'm horrible when it comes to the death penalty.  I think if you take someone's life, you're done.  You're done.  Period.  I don't know what Mayor Bloomberg's going to do, though, because what was that gun doing there?  He, you know, runs a pretty tight ship. 
[00:19:00]  What's that?  Ship.  What's that?  We don't have a lot of gun violence deaths in New York City, though, in general.  No.  Compared to other cities, right?  No.  We do okay.  Well, it's supposed to eliminate all of it, though.  So, if you, you know, you take away all the guns, it eliminates all the fucking violence.  The basketball culture in New York City, my, one of the guys that works in my garage, he  plays for a national team.  What?  They pay him a hundred and, what did he tell me, $120 a week to play, and I was trying 
[00:19:30]  to figure out what league it is, and it sounds like it's just some weird, like, pickup league  in Harlem, but they take it so seriously that they recruit some of these guys and they pay  him, you know, some pocket money to play on the team.  He plays for, shit, like the Dominican team or something like that?  Oh, boy.  Yeah, they actually got, you know, they got...  That's interesting.  I never heard of that.  I never heard of it either.  He goes, yeah, I'm on my way. 
[00:20:00]  You know, I got a game tonight.  I'm like, what are you talking about?  He goes, yeah, I get paid $120 a week to play.  Sounds very thuggish.  Huh?  Yeah.  Sounds very thuggish.  I would love to know more about that, because he wasn't willing to give up too much information.  I don't know if there's, it's a big gambling thing or what.  I have no idea.  But they're recruiting, you know, local guys to play on these leagues.  And what are their standings and all that?  I don't know.  That's why I'm bringing it up, because I love this show, because then you can learn some shit.  Yeah, then you learn. 
[00:20:30]  We're educational, half-assed.  Because there's no league you and I would know about, is what I'm getting at.  I don't even know about the NBA, so...  Some kind of pickup league that they take very seriously up there.  So it's north of here a bit.  North.  North.  Oh, yeah.  How about that?  Hmm.  I'm looking at the cover of this post.  Dark Knight death script. 
[00:21:00]  Oh.  Still giving this guy what he wants.  Of course.  A picture on the paper again.  They just don't care.  His name, they just don't care.  Why?  Because they don't...  And then right next to it is the fact that Kristen Stewart came clean about, I guess,  fooling around on Robert Pattinson.  Right.  So it's good that those things, the guy that massacred the 12 people and shot 70 total...  Right.  ...and now Kristen Stewart kissed a guy in a car and that's equal...  Aw.  Like, it's just...  Well...  Fucking...  What a dumb country this is. 
[00:21:30]  But the explanation is simple.  The papers and these TV shows love this shit when it goes down.  They love it.  They have to play their part on TV, but they can't wait for the next one.  They can't wait.  They love...  It's great for a business.  It's great for their ratings.  They love it.  Do you know the excitement in a newsroom when a story like this goes down?  Right.  They're fucking hustling, bustling.  It's what they live for.  Of course.  And...  You see how they're stretching it out?  Oh, yeah.  Because now every night they focus on the victims and just tell you how horrific and sad it 
[00:22:00]  is.  We all know that.  Totally.  You know, they got the story of the dad who was at the movie with his daughters, and  he's basically saying, you know, I love you guys, because he knew he wasn't going to  get out of the theater alive.  Eek.  So he's basically saying goodbye to his daughters.  It's horrific.  It's horrible.  Hey, uh...  And the papers and these news programs just eat it up.  Has that fucking coward fucking father been on any more interviews? 
[00:22:30]  He's hiding.  Did he finally shut the fuck up and realize people don't want to hear?  There is drivel.  Yeah, I think he's hiding a little bit.  Yeah.  Because there's real heroics that went down that night.  And he just fucking ran away.  Ha, ha, ha.  But, you know, to glorify this killer, I mean, oh my God.  And they simply don't care about the fact that it does...  Because it's boring to just call him a coward and move on.  They don't care.  Let's get into the mind of this guy.  Yeah.  And the fact that, you know, this Kristen Stewart thing is really bugging me, because, like, 
[00:23:00]  the fact that, like, she begged the guy not to publish the photo, she was cheating on  her boyfriend.  But, like, what a shitty culture that that's considered a publishable...  Like, who gives a fuck that she fooled her out?  It's depressing.  If Robert Pattinson is getting cheated on, the rest of us have...  Any woman you're dating is going to fuck somebody else.  If the star of Twilight can't keep his pussy in line, we're all finished.  I've seen a few interviews. 
[00:23:30]  He looks like a fucking boar, to be honest with you.  He probably is.  And this guy's 40...  The thing that I like about this is the director's 41 and she's 22 and he fucking got in there.  I love that.  I love that.  That's, like, encouraging for all of us, yeah.  But, like...  You think he touched a button?  Like, but they...  Oh, yeah, of course.  He probably is better to fool around with.  He's older and mature.  He likes older chicks, apparently.  Let's see what I did.  Yeah.  But the fact that, like, we don't live in a country where that would be considered...  Like, nah, I don't want to... 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  I don't want to publish those.  Those are people's private lives.  Oh, the guy probably got 100 Gs for it.  Yeah, I mean...  Minimum.  Magazines horrible.  I'm glad he got fucking cheated on.  Yeah.  Good.  Yeah, because he probably fucking...  I'll tell you why.  Because he's probably so fucking into himself and doesn't know how to fucking pleasure a woman  like he should.  And he's just fucking thinking about, you know, his next fucking thing.  You know? 
[00:24:30]  And all the chicks fucking drooling over him.  Meanwhile, he can't even fucking maybe lick a clit.  I was going to say, I bet he doesn't lick half that shit.  I bet he don't even fucking lick on that.  He don't lick half that shit.  Oh, my God.  Don't ignore the other half, guys.  Go down there.  You got to lick everything.  Lick it front to back like you're like...  Just lick, lick, lick.  Like when you pay the car wash for an undercarriage wash.  Yeah.  You got to lick that shit.  Oh, hell yeah.  Heh, heh. 
[00:25:00]  I will go to completely uncharted territories when you're talking that.  What else on the Joker?  Oh, the Joker.  What else we got on the Joker?  Unfortunately, he's still alive.  Oh, yeah.  I guess...  I think it's time to call him the Navy SEALs.  What have they been doing since Osama bin Laden?  They're a bit bored right now.  I guess the judges said that no more television?  Good.  In his court? 
[00:25:30]  Good.  Yeah, it is good.  Yeah, because look, he's always so mysterious.  Oh, he's so odd.  He's fake.  He's a fucking fake.  And someone in the jail, he's trying to look crazy.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he's trying to be crazy.  How about you see what the look on his face is when you're punching his nose through the  back of his head?  When a guard knocks his...  I'm telling you, breaking someone's jaw is fucking terrible.  Oh.  That's a hard injury.  Oh, yeah.  It makes you shatter his fucking jaw.  And then he'll be...  Then you'll be aware if he's crazy or not.  Right.  I'm glad the judge is taking the TV out of the courtroom. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, fuck him.  That means that's a judge that doesn't give a fuck about fame.  Seeing his dumb face on TV, making him famous, exactly what he wanted.  Yeah, you got these judges.  On the fucking backs of the victims.  They go, oh, fuck, I get a little camera time.  Of course we should keep the TVs in the courtroom.  That's what that's about.  Mm-hmm.  So you get a judge who doesn't give a fuck about that shit, then he does the right thing.  That's good.  That's good.  But, yeah, I mean, the Navy SEALs, they need to get in there.  They really just need to get in there. 
[00:26:30]  Take a nice long shot at them.  They could do that.  Or they could just, yeah, repel in.  Blow a hole in the roof.  Lower themselves down.  Bap, bap, bap, bap.  Just double tap him.  Right in the head.  At least the rest of the media is catching up.  We said days ago this guy was faking.  They're starting to say that he's probably faking.  More news outlets are saying that.  And the other thing we said, and it happened yesterday, and you know what?  I guess you can't judge people when they go through this shit, but you got someone that is forgiving this asshole.  Oh, really? 
[00:27:00]  You got someone that's forgiving him.  That's Stockholm Syndrome, these assholes.  Well, the first one came out yesterday.  If you could find that story, Sam, that would be terrific.  But you got someone already forgiving the guy.  I don't get that.  Is it a religious zealot?  Is that how you're able to sleep better at night?  Like, I don't understand the logic there.  Who is it, Sam?  Uh, Denver Rescue Mission employee Pierce O'Farrell was shot three times in the left arm and left leg in the attack on Friday. 
[00:27:30]  Rescue Mission, see?  Religious gunman.  Yeah.  And he has forgiven the alleged gunman.  He's not the alleged gunman.  He's the gunman.  He's the gunman.  Yeah, enough with, you know, I understand the alleged thing legally, but stop.  He said, of course, I forgive him with all my heart.  When I saw him in his hearing, I felt nothing but sorrow for him.  Oh, God.  He's a lost soul right now.  Yeah, tough shit.  If that's, the weird thing is, like, I hate the guy saying that, but I mean, if you get shot three times and say that, like, all right, that's just, this guy's one of these fucking people. 
[00:28:00]  I don't get it either.  It's hard to judge the guy, obviously, but it just enrages me because there's no, there's not a cell in my body that would do that.  No.  He says, uh, I want to, I want to see him sometime.  The first thing I want to say to him is, I forgive you.  And the next thing is, can I pray for you?  Can I pray?  Just do it against his will.  Just pray for him anyway.  Yeah, stop trying to bond with the guy that shot you, asshole.  I'm sure, I'm sure all the people that were praying in the movie theater that night, guess what? 
[00:28:30]  Their prayers didn't come, uh, help them out at all.  What about the people that didn't get hit?  Oh, that's true.  They're probably just, yeah, that's true.  How about that poor woman who prayed for a guy who would at least not leave her and the babies while they were being shot at?  She didn't get what she wanted?  That fucking guy's a creep.  That chicken shit.  I don't get that fucking forgiveness thing.  We told you it would happen.  We just keep hate. 
[00:29:00]  We just hold on to that hate.  Let it fuel you.  It's like a furnace on a hot day.  On a cold day, excuse me.  A furnace on a hot day.  That too.  Yeah, that's no good antifurnaces on hot days.  My foot hurts.  Is that thromming?  I can't think.  My foot hurts.  No, it's not thromming.  It's only when I put weight on it.  But it does feel like I got like a big thing in my shoe.  Yeah, like a rocket from it?  Like I'm stepping on it.  Is it swollen?  No, I don't know.  Maybe a little.  But it's not like bad. 
[00:29:30]  I'm just bitching and complaining here.  Like a fucking baby.  Jesus.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  God, do I want to make out with this girl.  Who?  Kristen Stewart.  She's a dirty one.  Yeah, huh?  She likes an older dick.  She's fucking...  You know what?  She's been banging this fucking teen idol for so long.  She just...  The director is probably just in charge on the set and she fucking...  How do you pull Kristen Stewart?  Like when you're...  Even if you're the director.  Yeah.  Do you know how good you have to be to fucking pull a starlet of that magnitude? 
[00:30:00]  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Fuck!  He probably fucks her well.  I don't even know if he's fucked her or not.  Maybe they just made out in the car.  But there's been shots of them in the diner way back in May.  I think she's been seeing this guy for a while.  Yeah.  And I'm doing exactly what I hate them to do.  I'm gossiping and fucking prattling on.  Kathy, you are.  But the Us Weekly...  But you know what?  Poor Robert Pattinson had to meet this guy.  Hey, how are you?  Cool.  And then now he looks back like, you've been fucking my girlfriend behind my back. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, man, right?  And this cunt introduced me to him.  I hope he blackballs him from the business.  From the biz.  The business.  There was one more thing on the Joker.  I'll call him the Joker.  It's kind of cute.  The Joker.  Asshole James Holmes.  I guess he asked, did he see the movie?  Yeah.  A creepy sounding Holmes asked, a stunned jail worker during a bizarre exchange Tuesday.  And then he goes and says, how does it end? 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, he's just...  Why are you a stunned jail worker?  Meanwhile, look at what the guy did.  Him asking about the end of the movie.  Not the worst thing he's done.  All right.  And then this person at least says, like, he had no idea why there was anything wrong with what he was saying.  It was sick.  I think he's trying real hard, act crazy.  Of course he is.  Yeah.  We said it days ago.  Trust us with this shit.  Yes, he is. 
[00:31:30]  Come on, Navy SEALs.  What do you got?  What do you got going on right now?  What do you say?  What do you say?  It'd be nice to make it look like an accident or something.  Yeah, of course.  He slipped.  Cracked his head on that fucking prison toilet bowl.  That's when I believe in some conspiracy shit.  That's when I do believe that the government could do some things.  Yeah.  But they never do.  Why don't they?  Terrible.  But they do one here.  Why not?  I don't know. 
[00:32:00]  Why not?  Because it doesn't lower gas prices.  All right, Jesse.  We get you.  Why not, man?  I've been watching some just shitty movies to get them out of the way because they're  on that Flex View on Fios.  Yeah.  You know, so the new releases and I'm like, there's nothing on regular TV.  So I just pop these on and I watched that, what you call 21 Jump Street. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  How good was it?  Not good, huh?  It was just, I didn't turn it off.  That's my complimentary.  You must have been really bored, then.  I didn't turn it off.  Yeah, nothing else worth doing, I guess.  Yeah, it was, you know, it was nighttime.  But are you one of those guys that needs to finish the movie if you start it?  No, not if it's real bad.  Yeah.  I didn't finish that stupid fucking movie that really bombed.  What the hell was the name of it?  No. 
[00:33:00]  The Space One.  Space One?  Star Wars?  The way they were locked up in space?  No, I watched that one last night, too, though.  The Space One?  It was so bad.  Really?  Where the chick was in here for her?  Yeah, Guy Pearce and the chick from Lost was in here.  She was selling it.  Which chick?  Remember?  She was the president's daughter.  The blonde chick.  Oh, yeah, she was pretty hot.  Starting church February.  It really was...  Space Jail.  Yeah, John Carter was the one I just turned off.  Oh, God.  I was like...  It was so utterly bad.  That was supposed to be a big hit, too, right?  Oh, what a fucking... 
[00:33:30]  That was supposed to be a blockbuster.  Big lump of shit.  What was the comedy?  Oh, what was wrong with 21 Jump Street?  Oh, nothing was wrong with it.  It had some funny gags in it, and they kind of goof on the actual 21 Jump Street from the 80s.  You've got to remember that show to get the jokes, though.  Yeah.  And it was, you know, there were some funny parts in it.  The gym teacher guy is really fucking funny.  And there's some cameos from some original 21 Jump Street cast members. 
[00:34:00]  Richard Greco?  Uh-huh.  What?  Richard Greco?  You know what?  I wish I would have seen him, but I didn't.  Oh.  I don't know why.  I think I could have thrown him in there.  Why did you want to see him so badly?  He was adorable.  How was Jonah Hill?  Jonah Hill was Jonah Hill.  He played the Jonah Hill character he plays in everything.  So...  Okay.  That was, uh, it was, there were some laughs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then that lockout was just, uh...  Horrible.  It was so bad. 
[00:34:30]  It's like they had, it's like they had a set and some actors and just decided to film,  like, and, and go make the story up as they went along.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Let's see the trailer for this.  Really bad.  Mmm.  Three.  And even the effects were, were bad.  Three point seven million views on the trailer.  It's the world's most secure prison.  Oh, this looks cool.  Yeah.  It looks cool.  It looks the planet's deadliest criminal. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah, it's not douchey at all, this little child.  It's impenetrable.  Food.  Because it's not on Earth.  What?  Whoa.  Crazy, right?  Whoa.  Crazy.  Can I ask you a few questions?  Want them answered immediately?  I'm going to dream about you.  You want to test me?  Sit down.  He's got a gun.  The muse, that sound.  Yeah.  There's been a massive tape.  My iPhone alarm.  MS1.  Who cares if you take over a prison?  Well, the president's daughter.  The president's daughter's in there. 
[00:35:30]  Why is she in there?  Third February's got to come and save her.  But why was she in there?  Interviewing people.  Yeah, she was on some kind of, you know, mission.  Mercy.  The best there is.  He's a loose cannon.  Oh, he's a loose cannon.  He is a loose cannon.  Ah, Jimmy's a lot of those.  Don't get me wrong.  It's a dream vacation.  I mean, I go into space.  I get inside the maximum security nun house.  Oh.  Get past all the psychos.  Oh.  Save the president's daughter.  She's not dead already.  I'm thrilled that he would think of me. 
[00:36:00]  Get in there.  Oh.  God, I hate that.  Yeah.  Wow.  The gravity generated will hold you up.  You've got to trust me on this.  Really?  Oh, boy.  It's so fucking bad.  How terrible is this?  We promoted this movie, you know.  And you already know that he got her because they showed it.  They did?  Yeah.  Yeah, just now.  He's with her.  The crazy prisoner.  Oh, they're all crazy. 
[00:36:30]  All these prisoners.  It's falling out of the sky.  There's not one prisoner that's like, I just have three years left on an accounting rap.  Yeah.  I'll be your crony.  And now you know it's going to happen.  Yeah.  This doesn't work.  Well, we're probably going to die.  Oh.  Wow.  Tough dialogue.  He's crazy.  Yeah.  Guy Fierce.  Guy Fierce is crazy.  Yeah.  That looks good.  And then, I'll tell you.  I won't spoil it for anyone.  Ooh.  Those people think he's enough. 
[00:37:00]  At the end of this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's all dialogue like that.  Is it really?  Yes.  Like tango and cash dialogue?  Yes.  And that's one of the jokes, really, is because his name is Snow.  They call me Snow.  Of course it is.  They call me Snow.  And she's like, what's your name?  What's your name?  Snow.  What's your first name?  Snow.  I'm not saying.  And then, at the end, she finds out.  And his name?  Marion.  Like Marion Cobretti from Cobra.  If you remember fucking Cobra with Stallone. 
[00:37:30]  So, he's got the weird chick kind of weird wussy name.  But he's fucking all man.  He's Snow.  When they say he's a loose cannon.  He's a loose cannon, though.  Who the fuck wrote that?  But who's so out of touch with dialogue and believability that they thought that's a good line?  Why don't we call him a loose cannon in our marketing?  God, how do you fucking stinks?  And then, at the end of this, they've got to kind of save themselves. 
[00:38:00]  And from the point where there's a huge action sequence to the point where they're safe.  And remember, this is in space.  Sure.  And to be safe, I believe they've got to be back on Earth.  Right.  It just takes like, it's like a 30-second piece.  Jesus.  Like, there's no thought to it.  All of a sudden, they're just safe.  Like, there's no thrilling, like, oh my God, what's going to happen?  It was terrible. 
[00:38:30]  Terrible.  You know, I go to On Demand every night to try to find a movie.  Yeah.  I can't find anything to watch.  Very difficult.  I did watch the new Chris Rock movie that's not out yet, called, I think, Two Days.  What have they got that?  You can get it now.  Yeah, yeah.  I like that feature.  I spent, what, like 10 bucks on it?  Yeah.  $10.  I liked it.  A lot of dialogue.  Isn't that great?  A lot of subtitles.  A lot of Frenchies. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, man.  You're reading and shit?  Yeah, the French come over, like, I guess his in-laws come over to visit.  I like having to read when I watch TV.  Chris Rock married to a white woman.  Oh, yeah?  And her, like, relatives, her father and sister and sister's boyfriend come to town for a couple days.  It's a bit crazy.  It gets wild.  Yeah, I liked it, though.  Is Medea in it?  You got to read a lot, though.  Chris Rock's taking a chance with the reading thing.  Yeah.  You got to read a lot of subtitles, because they speak a lot of French in this movie. 
[00:39:30]  Exactly.  But it wasn't bad.  But besides that, I can't find any movies on that damn on-demand thing.  Eh, that's why.  I just run through them.  I, you know, nothing's on TV.  I'll just pop one of these horrible ones on and give it a look, see?  Yeah, good for you.  Eh, why not?  What else am I doing?  Here comes our food.  We should take a break.  Oh, nice.  We got a busy day today, actually.  Do we?  Yeah.  Jimmy's leaving us.  8.30, I leave.  I'm bummed over to Miss Pat Cooper, man.  So am I.  It'll be good. 
[00:40:00]  He's exhausting.  Yeah, we, you know, he's not going to do anything different today.  He's not going to miss much.  I know.  But he is entertaining us all.  I probably want to know why, like, if you tell him I left,  What the fuck's he leave early for?  Yeah, right.  How the fuck's he leave early?  This is the gig!  Yeah.  How the fuck are you going to Montreal?  The fucking gig's here!  He'll just get angry, you're right, for no reason.  No dedication, he'll say.  No dedication.  No dedication.  Where's Jim Norton? 
[00:40:30]  Norton.  Yeah.  Or if you just say, he might, he might, I won't even remember that I'm on this show.  Yeah.  But if you used to go, you know, the guy that's normally here isn't here because he left the  door to Montreal.  He'll probably be incensed by that.  You know how many people would like that job?  Yeah.  What?  You're a fucking bricklayer!  You're not going to put up steel!  You're fucking like bricks!  Exactly.  You laid a brick!  You don't dare, I've been going to any other job! 
[00:41:00]  You laid a brick!  My father would lay brick by brick!  Exactly.  My favorite Pat Cooper thing is he calls his father a saint on earth.  And then you learn that his father, like, ditched his entire family.  That's not a saint on earth.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What, even the not a smell comes from the bathroom when his father used to take shits?  I guess so.  I actually can't wait for Pat Cooper.  He's a treat.  I hate missing him, man.  He's a treat, man.  Two days in New York, getting good reviews there, Sam. 
[00:41:30]  There was a rumor Chris Rock might come in and promote this thing.  I don't know if it's happening, but I enjoyed the movie.  I think it's based on some French film or something.  I don't know.  Oh, boy.  Or some French writer who wrote a famous film, wrote this.  There's some kind of French connection that I don't know.  French connection?  French connection.  And also, coming up, why buying sports memorabilia is just a fucking waste.  Oh, boy.  What happened to Jim Norton?  No, not me.  No.  Oh, God, no.  I wish this was my problem.  All right.  It's a very, very important piece of memorabilia. 
[00:42:00]  Hey, do you have that Chris Rock gun thing?  E-Rock, you find it?  All right.  Chris Rock has a...  What the fuck is E-Rock finding thing?  Find it!  Find.  We were just talking about Chris Rock.  Chris Rock has a good take on the whole gun control issue.  Check this out.  Everybody talking about gun control.  Got to get rid of the guns.  Look at that.  I like guns.  You got a gun, you don't have to work out.  I ain't working out. 
[00:42:30]  I ain't jogging.  You got techs?  I got techs.  Oh, man, shit.  You don't need no gun control.  You know what you need?  We need some bullet control.  We need to make...  We need to control the bullets.  That's right.  I think all bullets should cost $5,000.  $5,000 for a bullet.  You know why?  Because if a bullet costs $5,000,  there'll be no more innocent bystanders. 
[00:43:00]  The end.  The end.  Every time somebody gets shot,  they'll be like,  Dad, he must have did something.  Should they put $50,000 worth of bullets in his ass?  And people will think  before they kill somebody  if a bullet costs $5,000,  man, I would blow your fucking head off  if I could afford it.  I'm going to get me another job. 
[00:43:30]  I'm going to start saving some money.  And you a dead man.  You better hope I can't get no bullets on layaway.  So even if you get shot by a straight bullet,  you won't have to go to no doctor  to get it taken out.  Whoever shot you  will take their bullet back.  I believe you got my property.  Sirius XM.  You're listening to O.B. and Anthony.  Whether or not you're paying attention  is another question. 
[00:44:00]  I knew this would happen today, Iraq.  Good choice.  Mick Jagger, 69 years old today.  Fuck.  69 for Mick Jagger.  Maybe he had the better reason.  He wouldn't be this obvious with it.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Please tell me you have a better reason  than it's Mick Jagger's birthday.  Yeah, there's a double Stones thing today.  Beggar's Banquets, 43 years ago today,  was released.  What are the songs on the Beggar's Banquets? 
[00:44:30]  And I always forget.  Stones, thumbs up or down?  Sympathy for the girls.  I like them.  Na, na, na, na, na, na, na.  Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na.  I liked it when you wrote that on an email yesterday.  E-Rock answered an email that we were all in.  And Jimmy's email was just, na, na, na, na, na, na.  You get a lot of those on Twitter yesterday, E-Rock?  Yes, thank you.  And for the YouTube links to clips from the show.  Nice. 
[00:45:00]  Good, good.  What's wrong with that, right?  Stones, thumbs up or down?  I like the Stones.  But I'm not like a fanatical fan where I know every song from every album or anything.  But I like them.  Part two.  Stones or Beatles?  I got to go with the Beatles, I guess.  I go Stones.  Yeah.  I really do.  Beatles were way more consistent.  Yeah.  But I like the Stones over the Beatles.  Absolutely.  I can't like, I can't like, I can't like, I can't just like, I can't just like, I can't 
[00:45:30]  just like, it's, it's, it's rock wars.  But you don't have to pick, why can't you like onions and blueberry marmalade?  A guy that has no clue how to make a comparison.  You know how we talk about how horrible regular radio is?  It's been horrible for probably 20 to 25 years.  For years.  I had to deal with Battle of the Bigs.  And then every hour it'd be like, okay, this hour's battle.  The Rolling Stones, this is an epic battle.  All right.  Yes. 
[00:46:00]  I remember that.  The Rolling Stones of the Beatles.  And then you had to call in and some asshole intern had to like make check marks under the  Rolling Stones of the Beatles.  And then by the end of the hour, they were like, all right.  Rolling Stones got 548 votes.  The Beatles, 602.  That means we're going to play three Beatles songs.  How about, they wouldn't even just tell you though.  They'd be like, after the break, we're going to have the results.  Well, there would be brackets too.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Leading up to the, the, the ultimate battle.  The ultimate battle. 
[00:46:30]  It was always like Zeppelin versus Floyd or something in the end.  So you got sympathy for the devil off this.  What else?  I'll tell you what I like.  Stray Cat Blues.  Nah.  Salt of the Earth.  Street Fighting Man.  That's what I'm talking about.  It's about the devil.  Yes.  Very good, sir.  This fucking song rules.  Yeah.  You like the sympathy.  Uh, yeah.  Yeah.  Talking about the Kennedys and all that shit.  Yeah, I like this one.  Yeah.  Woo.  Woo. 
[00:47:00]  Fuck, yeah.  Did you like Battle of the Bands?  Battle of the Bands was so dumb.  It's like, uh, I, because like you said, it always ended up with like a couple of  super bands.  Right.  But they would waste your time in between by doing like, yeah, it's fucking, you know,  the Kaja Goo Goo.  Yeah.  Against, uh, the fucking, uh, yeah, culture.  Well, I always felt bad because it was all bullshit in the end.  You had a program director going, oh, no, obviously Zeppelin has to win.  Yeah, yeah.  Because, uh, our consultant has, uh, done the research and, well, and our radio station 
[00:47:30]  has way more Zeppelin fans than Floyd fans.  So in the end, we gotta do Zeppelin.  We all know that, right?  Did you say that?  It's still real for me.  Oh, yeah.  It's still real for me.  It was all bullshit.  It's the wrestling is what it is.  It was complete bullshit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was all based on demographics and research.  Really sad, actually.  Take a chance?  Come on, stop.  Why take a chance?  This is a goddamn good song.  Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo. 
[00:48:00]  That part goes on for too long at the end.  11 minutes of woo, woo.  Got it.  Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo.  I like a good hoo-hoo in a rock song.  It was just endless.  Who's playing the piano in this?  Chuck Berry.  Who did that?  Oh, who did that?  Uh, I don't know.  Who played the fucking piano?  I don't know.  They had a whole bunch of guys that helped them out.  Was it Billy Preston? 
[00:48:30]  Everyone's putting Billy Preston up with a question mark.  I don't know, to be honest with you.  Ronnie B would know.  Ronnie B would know in a second.  Ronnie B knows his Stones.  Yeah.  Ronnie B knows his shit.  Jay Moore knows his shit when it comes to the Rolling Stones.  Yeah.  Oh, they kick my ass.  Yeah, they're good.  They're real good.  Ronnie will turn you out to Stones songs you've never heard before that are amazing.  Sometimes, uh, when I'm driving home and, uh, of course the, uh, shit show has ended, uh, and I was in traffic or something. 
[00:49:00]  Ron and Fez show starts.  And, uh, boy, will they play some obscure bluesy tune.  Yeah.  And I'll just sit there going, get to Ron and Fez already.  Jesus.  What the fuck?  You don't like the bluesy stuff, huh?  I like some of it.  By the Stones, you mean?  No, by like, even, like, some of these old blues artists.  Oh.  It just, uh, sometimes it's just ponderous to listen to. 
[00:49:30]  What is this garbage?  I love the fact that the Anastasia he refers to in this song turned out to be a fake.  Oh.  He didn't know at the time, of course.  What do you mean?  Anastasia was from when the Tsar and his family were murdered, and, uh, supposedly one of the children survived, and then this Anastasia surfaced years later, and she was like this royalty of this family that had been killed.  Royalty.  But it turns out it was a fake.  Whoops.  She was a fraud.  They found out after she died, really.  A little flaw in the song now.  Well.  Yeah.  Sing? 
[00:50:00]  Well, she did exist, but.  Kevin from Connecticut gets the plug today.  It's, uh, because you asked.  It's Nikki Hopkins on piano.  Oh.  What the fuck is he?  Anthony's friend.  Oh, no.  Why wouldn't it be?  A lot of people say other.  A lot of people say other.  A lot of people say other.  A lot of people say other.  Nikki Hopkins.  Double Ivory.  Ah, there you go.  Helen Mirren is 67 years old today.  She's taking her tits out.  I like her tits.  I don't.  I'd like them if it were the fucking 30.  Every once in a while, some big and heavy.  Yeah, but not old big and heavies. 
[00:50:30]  They're like young big and heavies.  They're big and heavies on Helen Mirren.  They're holding up there.  No.  Wow.  She's starting to look like the broad from The Shining.  Yes.  She's in a bathtub right there.  Wow.  She really is starting to look like that.  Oh, gosh.  Oh, she's just.  You know what I came across yesterday while I was Googling?  Look at those big and heavies.  But that's a couple years ago now for the Helen Mirren.  Yeah, that's a few years ago.  Whatever.  Pictures.  You know what any of that looks like totally naked?  You'd go there, right?  She's not bad looking.  I mean, for 66, I'd fuck her. 
[00:51:00]  I'd suck her big, heavy tits.  Would you?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  She was in Caligula.  You have to.  Would you go down on that fucking powder smelling pussy?  Not after a long day in a pantsuit, but I would after a fucking shower.  I guess she's got to the tub.  A long day gardening.  She's there with a little fucking little tool and her big dumb hat.  Just sweating in her polyester pants in the garden.  Oh, God.  You don't like those people?  No.  You see them all over in New York City.  They're gardening.  No.  These sad saps, they get a little piece of land that's maybe as big as this studio. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, they're tilling it like pawingles.  Right.  And 20 people get to make a little garden in this tiny space.  Yeah.  It's so sad to watch.  They love it, though.  That's every old woman from like an arthritis commercial.  So it's bent over, fucking with a little shovel.  It's called a trowel, isn't it?  Is it?  A trowel or something?  A trowel or trowel.  I don't know.  I know that from my cement working day.  I like gardening, but arthritis pain has made it so difficult. 
[00:52:00]  And then she like drops the little shovel thing, grabs her hand and goes like, oh, a friend told me.  Ah, enough.  Yeah.  Hate those commercials.  You don't like them?  No.  I'm still just obsessed with the Posse Vec commercial, though.  Well, they're getting sued.  Yeah.  The quote the guy gives, I'm obsessed with the quote.  He, he, they're taking like testimonials from these guys that all look like sex offenders.  They all look like fucking just people that are raping, uh, uh, uh, children. 
[00:52:30]  Right.  Yes, Uncle Paul.  You'd fit right in.  Posse Vec.  The guy says, he goes, why take the best part of life out of life when you can have life with Posse Vec?  What does that mean?  He wants his erections.  Yeah.  He's not talking about boner.  He's talking about life.  Why take the best part of life out of life when you can have the life with the life life of the life of the Posse Vec? 
[00:53:00]  Well, that's working around the obvious.  He's got to talk about his tech.  Look at these guys.  And then the guy poking the woman in the tire swing, that guy that's, you know what that's represented, right?  She's making a bed and it's on the table with lube and fucking, look at this guy.  Look, I'm poking at you.  Oh, what is he doing?  They're flirting.  That is so.  She's in a tire.  Oh, her vagina is as big as the tire swing she's in.  Yeah.  That's why you can't get a rod.  Do you think more or less old ladies love the fact that their older husbands can now get boners? 
[00:53:30]  Way less, right?  Old bags don't want to fucking have a dick in them anymore.  There's the rare exception to the rule, horny old broad.  But for the most part, they're content fucking just doing crossword puzzles.  So they're completely bummed out when all these dick pills came about?  When that fucking posty vac showed up on the night table, the wife just looks and like, oh, Christ, no.  I'll tell you what happened to the posty vac. 
[00:54:00]  If they really want this to work, you buy the posty vac and your fucking chick gets 25 years younger.  Yes.  Then all of a sudden your dick would work.  But that's why your dick's not working, because she's old.  Let me see your erectile dysfunction if you've got just a hot fucking piece of ass in front of you, naked on the bed.  This guy just looks like a murderer.  Yeah, he should be checked out.  This guy's BTK.  When I am raping a nurse, I like to have a firm erection.  She's just bloodied on the bed, just coming to consciousness. 
[00:54:30]  Through the haze, she looks up and sees him pumping his dick up, sliding that ring over the base to keep his fucking half-flaccid rod.  He tries to tuck it in.  That's classic.  Oh, God.  What are you going to do?  Yeah, I guess.  The posty vac is going away, right?  Well, it hasn't yet, but it seems that there was some kind of scam going on with the insurance companies.  They keep saying that it's the only erectile dysfunction device approved by Medicaid, and insurance companies will pay for it. 
[00:55:00]  But the truth of the matter is, I think they were lying about these flying out the door.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  They were saying a bunch were sold, and then they got reimbursed for them, and I think they were out in a dumpster up back or something.  I don't know.  Speaking of old broads, my Googling got me to a place, and I guess it's old news if you watch that Joan Rivers and Melissa show, Joan and Melissa. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, boy.  There's a video online of her going in for more plastic surgery, I guess.  I don't watch the show.  But I ended up on this clip, and it's her without makeup.  It's horrifying.  Is it really?  Joan Rivers, I will never deny, is one funny broad, man.  She's hilarious.  Yeah.  In that documentary, I felt bad for her, to be honest with you.  But there's a video of her without makeup getting ready for plastic surgery.  My mouth was open. 
[00:56:00]  I couldn't believe it.  Oh, man.  What the fuck?  Dude.  You got to see.  All right.  This is her without makeup.  If anything happens, Melissa.  No, but I'm no chicken.  I've had a great life.  She looks like she's blind.  I've had an amazing life.  Yeah, her eyes are dumb.  If I died this morning, nobody would say so young.  And look at the nose.  It looks like the nose is ready to break in half.  It's like they shaved it out of clay and then just stuck it on her face.  I've had an amazing life.  If it ended right now, amazing life. 
[00:56:30]  And you've been wonderful.  We've had a great run.  What is she self-doing?  Yeah, I know you're nervous and I feel awful about that.  Her nose is terrible.  It's terrible.  You don't like to feel like people don't like you or care about you or want you.  When she has all that makeup on, she plows some spackle into there.  It's about you.  And if something happens, things are fine.  Oh, because she's gone into surgery of some sort.  It's so much fun.  It's more plastic surgery.  She's taking the risk of maybe dying, having more plastic surgery. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, man.  Such a brilliant comic.  I would love to know what that is about.  She's having the vagina on her chin sewn shut.  I see, because they pull that skin back.  Remember that?  That's an old gag.  Does it say what kind of plastic surgery she was getting this time?  I guess this is from my...  Another lift.  The first of the year or something.  I mean, this is old, but I just came across it yesterday.  I couldn't believe it.  Skin's got to be like saran wrap. 
[00:57:30]  I don't know why you would do that to yourself to that point.  It's like that cat lady that...  Oh, God.  I guess it used to be something...  That crazy old broad.  Who went way too far with her fucking plastic surgery.  Some of these women don't get it.  Huh?  Some of these women don't get it.  Yeah.  You know?  I guess if you do a little, whatever.  Maybe people that have done a little, you don't notice it.  I don't know.  I think if you do a little, you don't notice.  But then there's that neck and the hands and everything else. 
[00:58:00]  Then you just kind of look silly.  You got like the face, but then the rest of you is kind of coming apart at the seams.  This is some fucking nasty old lady in CVS yesterday yelling at the pharmacist.  Why?  Old people at fucking pharmacies.  They love their pills, though.  They love being there.  They love being at the counter and getting into a little fucking spat with the pharmacists  and the people that just work there.  There's always a problem.  The doctor never writes the right script or they fucking like the insurance is always 
[00:58:30]  whenever I see the woman walk up to the counter, she goes, um, OK, here's your prescription  sign right here.  That's two hundred and thirty dollars.  What?  No, the insurance.  Oh, yeah.  The insurance isn't covering it.  But I talked to and then they start now explaining to that.  Here's what you do in that situation.  Say, OK, thank you.  I'll be I'll be back with you. 
[00:59:00]  Step aside and get on your phone and call the people that you have to talk to, not the  pharmacist.  They're not there to listen to your fucking shit.  You know what?  And I agree with you.  People are annoying.  Oh, they stink.  When you're saying that, it also makes me hate the world we're in because that what  you just said, like, but I but I talked to Joe and he said he was going to call  F.O.  That's how it worked years ago.  Yeah.  Like, literally, that would mean something in 1960.  Yeah. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  I hear you.  She'd come in and go, I talked to so and so.  And the pharmacist would go, oh, OK, cool.  Let me give him a call.  Yeah.  There was no fucking everything wasn't computerized and impersonal.  Like, literally, there's nothing you can say in a customer service situation which moves  anybody.  We are a fucking robots.  That's true.  But back then, that meant something.  She'd say, I talked to Joe and he said that it was covered.  And the guy would go, all right, we'll do it.  But I got to talk to Joe.  Right.  It meant something to say that.  Yeah.  There's everything's in place now. 
[01:00:00]  That's it.  You should have punched in the face.  That's it.  How long was she, like, at the counter?  And why were you behind her?  It had to be, like, I don't know, like, fucking 10 minutes.  Oh, my God.  That's it.  And she just kept going off.  That's an eternity when you're trying to pay for something.  And the pharmacists were, like, trying to help her.  Right.  You know, they're literally trying to help her and shit.  But she just, but old people, I'm convinced they love that.  They just love the confrontation and the conversation. 
[01:00:30]  Like, this old broad wasn't doing anything.  She's going home, maybe, to a husband unless he's dead.  And what?  The same conversation they've had for fucking 40 years?  Or she could go to the pharmacy and fucking yap it up with the girls there and discuss why this didn't work.  There's some truth in what you just said.  Old people, that's all they got.  That's all they got.  Is the trip to the CVS.  Doctors' offices, CVS, anything medical related.  When, I brought this up years ago when we talked about, you know, you go to a diner and, God forbid, an old fucking group or couple or whatever sits next to you or behind you. 
[01:01:00]  All you're going to hear are horrific stories of tumors, kidneys, cancer, fucking procedures.  That's all they fucking talk about.  That's all they got.  Old people stink with their fucking diseases.  God, shut up already.  Oh, did you hear?  It's always, did you hear about Mary? 
[01:01:30]  Myrtle.  Oh, what happened?  What happened?  Mary.  Well, they found a lump.  They found a spot on her lung.  She's going for tests.  And that's the way, that's the way that, yeah, that Mildred passed.  If you remember, they found that spot on her lung.  And within, I'm trying to eat, you fucking, ugh.  Especially if you're having an egg white omelet that has like a fucking little cherry on it.  Oh, boy.  Death is all around those people. 
[01:02:00]  At the end of my dad's life, he was going to wakes every other fucking week.  I felt so bad for my dad.  It's like they never talked about anything else.  Because I've gone to the diners, and, you know, I've had like a guest with me.  And I sit down, and especially people that aren't from Long Island.  Because a Long Island diner is, you know.  Pretty good.  I was just talking about this the other day.  It's very good, yeah.  I took the long way home from Greenport, and we were passing all those old school diners.  Oh, yeah, they're great.  I was explaining to my wife, I'm like, you have no idea, man.  These diners fucking rule.  It is rule. 
[01:02:30]  But when we go in, I would explain, like, if an old couple sat down, I would say, watch this.  I go, they will absolutely, at some point, start talking about medical bullshit.  Right.  And I've never been wrong.  Right.  They always fucking just don't shut up about that.  And they're still competitive, so they try to outdo each other with medical issues.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, you were talking about pet peeves.  It put a thought in my head quickly.  Like, you know when you go to a counter, and you're ready to, I guess it, mostly in hotels, I guess.  And you're ready to check in, and all of a sudden that damn phone rings, and all of a sudden the person, instead of going, could you hold on a minute? 
[01:03:00]  I'm with, you know, somebody.  Yeah.  They deal with them instead of a live person in front of them.  Can I call you back?  I've got customers.  But it drives me nuts.  Yeah.  They do it everywhere.  It's like, I should be the priority.  I'm right in front of your fucking face right now.  You are not the priority.  But as soon as that phone rings, they have to take care of that problem, and it doesn't matter how long, you know, they're going to be on the phone with that person.  Yeah. 
[01:03:30]  I'm trying to think where else it happens.  Mostly at hotels.  Just when you're about to check in, that phone rings, and they will fucking talk to that person as long as it takes.  Yeah, I don't like the phone ringing when you're doing something.  And I also don't like when you're...  But should protocol be, look, you know, hold on a minute.  Yeah, it should be.  Period.  I got someone in front of me.  It's not.  They need to watch their training tape.  Weird.  Also in CVS, when you're at the front counter buying whatever garbage they sell there, and there's a long line and just one person there at one register. 
[01:04:00]  They got, you know, five or six registers, all closed.  One person's there, retardedly ringing shit up.  Why don't you open another fucking register?  And you see the other people that are working.  Yeah.  And they almost look at you like, yeah, I know I could go to that register, but guess what?  I'm not.  Oh, you'd rather fucking, you know, price the cheesy fucking beach balls?  No, they usually have a piece of paper in front of them like it's some kind of like...  Oh, very important. 
[01:04:30]  Bullshit crap.  Very important.  Oh, they do that on purpose.  That's what I mean.  And then, again, even there, everyone's got a problem.  I have a coupon for that.  Yes, this coupon's expired.  Oh, no, it isn't.  It was in the circular from this morning.  It can't be...  And then I just, I really make sounds.  I start going, oh, really?  Yep.  I just stand there angry.  Yep.  Oh, everything makes me angry.  This world.  The people in their chains drive me nuts.  We've done this bit, but it's worth repeating. 
[01:05:00]  The purse and...  Where it's like $7.27.  Anyone else, anyone else with a brain would just, here's $10.  Oh, I think I got the change.  Yeah.  And they got to go to the third compartment in their purse thing.  It's like the purse, then it's another bag, and then in that bag is a change thing.  It's so annoying.  And then they pull that out, and then they unzip it, and then they're looking for exact change.  Do you think it's selfish?  Oh, it's beyond selfish.  And then when they're done with the transaction, they're trying to put their shit back together 
[01:05:30]  again, like those Russian eggs.  Right.  It's fucking...  Move your shit to the side.  Right in front of you.  Move the shit to the side and let me walk up, you fuck.  I hate them.  When I'm in public, I'm always aware that I might be in someone's way.  So if I'm in a situation where maybe I got a few things that I got to take care of after  I pay for something, I am move to the side guy.  Move to the side guy.  Or just walk away, and then I'll find a flat surface and put all my shit back together.  Yeah. 
[01:06:00]  These people that do it right in front of you, and they know there's people behind them.  Holy fuck.  Oh, my God.  Online shopping rules.  Oh, that's why.  I'm finally in, man.  Online shopping is the shit.  We got boxes coming to our apartment every fucking day.  Isn't it great?  It's like Christmas.  Every fucking day.  Isn't it like Christmas?  You just get a box, and you're like, oh, what's this?  When a box shows up at the apartment, there's nothing better.  Especially when it has a little extra, right, Jimmy?  Oh, baby.  Oh, man. 
[01:06:30]  But I wasn't in on that online shopping for the longest time, but I'm all in.  I cannot get enough of it.  I am Mr. Online Shopper.  Yep.  Yep.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, my goodness.  My fucking building, I had ordered these two little, three plastic little crates to store  things in, so they didn't log in when it came, and then somebody was moving, and they  wound up putting my boxes on somebody else's thing, and some fucking person took my boxes  and left the building. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, man.  Oh, that's nice.  Yeah, they're very apologetic, but I'm like, what kind of asshole doesn't return the fucking  boxes?  Yeah, that's someone that realized he got something for free that day.  Nice.  Who fucked up?  Yeah, who fucked up?  Who fucked that up?  My building and the guy.  Yeah?  My building did.  Mm.  Man.  Mm.  Fuck, man.  I like silence.  I'm liking the silence today.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Man, a lot of people are having a problem with that goddamn app yesterday.  The app is still complaining, and the Echo Fan Twitter app sucks a fucking pile of dick. 
[01:07:30]  There were people that were saying they're going to just fucking cancel.  Like, why would the company...  I get cancellations every day.  Yeah.  Why would they put it with that?  It has nothing to do with our show.  It's...  They're just beyond frustrated with customer service.  They're beyond frustrated with the app.  They're like, I'm paying good money for the app.  It doesn't work.  I got to cancel, guys.  I'm sorry.  And then they'll write, I've been listening for 12 years, but I've had it.  And not with the show.  You don't think the customer service is good?  I'm sure there's some people that cancel because of the show or whatever, but what I see overwhelmingly  is people canceling because they can't deal with the customer service and the app. 
[01:08:00]  You don't think the customer service does a good job?  I...  Are they even in the United States?  It's been my experience that the customer service at SiriusXM blows dead monkeys.  Is it bad?  Dicks.  Yes.  Dead monkey dicks.  Where is it from?  Is it from the States?  I don't know, but I get complaints about it every fucking day.  Every day.  Every day.  Every day.  Why the fuck?  And complaints on the app every day. 
[01:08:30]  They got this dumb thing on the app where it shuts down after an hour, which is the stupidest thing.  Why would you have that?  That is the dumbest thing.  Because most people, I hate to fucking educate these people because I don't feel like educating  these assholes anymore.  But if you get an app for satellite radio, you're mostly getting the app for a talk show,  not for a music channel.  Right, because you have an iPod, right.  So, if you have the app, odds are you're going to listen for more than an hour. 
[01:09:00]  It's the dumbest thing.  Why does it shut off after an hour?  What is their thinking?  It times out thinking that you're not using the app.  But why does it have to time out?  Why?  They don't have enough space for all the people using apps?  I don't know.  I always say bandwidth, yeah.  Is it a bandwidth thing?  Yeah.  They don't want it just running.  Well, then why can't there be some kind of option?  For talk, yeah.  Yeah, because if you're listening to a talk show, of course an hour is nothing.  You could eat that shit up in minutes.  In the middle of a bit, it will just shut down?  Yeah, yeah.  Who the fuck wants to pay for that?  Yeah, it shuts down.  Ugh. 
[01:09:30]  And then what, you got to sign back in or something?  Yeah, you got to sign back in and select your channel again and then wait for it to load  back up.  That's fucking horrible.  There's got to be a better way.  They really need to fix that.  They're not going to, though.  You know, when I'm listening to podcasts, it doesn't shut down after an hour.  Or that's the world you're competing with.  I download my podcast.  I go to the gym.  And guess what?  Sometimes I'm in the gym more than an hour.  It never shuts down for me.  God, it's just dumb shit.  That couldn't be it. 
[01:10:00]  Huh?  People don't record shows.  Are they still worried about that shit?  Is that your guess?  Yeah, that's just a guess.  Well, you're guessing now.  That's just guessing.  What happened?  Speculating.  What's this, a guessing game?  Ah, shit.  Words back.  Are you a fan of self-checkout?  I hated self-checkout at first.  Love it.  Love it, too.  Love it.  When I go to Home Depot, to not have to stand on that fucking mutant line of idiots.  Yeah.  It's fantastic.  You just bring your own shit up and leave. 
[01:10:30]  I'm a great checker-outer, though.  Oh, yeah?  Like, whenever I'm doing it, the manager will come over and say,  Hey, can we make a video of you doing this?  You're so good at it, sir.  No.  I'll say no, I can't.  It's kind of fun.  It's kind of fun.  I love it.  Put the item in the bag.  Oh, okay.  I feel like I'm doing something.  It's great.  And they weigh everything.  They got it all figured out nice.  Oh, yeah.  They got it figured out.  Do you, uh...  But one lady goes to me, uh...  I guess it said no cash.  I didn't see that.  Uh-oh.  And I didn't have a credit card. 
[01:11:00]  I guess I just had cash on me.  I'm trying to remember exactly what happened that day.  Who are you?  I don't know.  Sometimes I walk around.  It's 2012.  But I don't want to carry all my shit.  Oh, boy.  Fucking 2,000-pound credit card.  But anyway.  All right.  You should always have your ID and a credit card on you.  Why?  You never know when you're going to need it.  Sometimes I just have cash in my fucking...  Oh, man.  And a lot of it if you try to...  Oh, well.  If you want some money, come find me.  I have some.  You might get a big fucking surprise. 
[01:11:30]  I always have credit with it because you never know.  Got to.  But the lady yelled at me because it said...  She goes, it said no cash.  And I go, it's not your job to scold me.  Obviously, I didn't see that.  Oh, man.  Apparently, it is.  I'm an asshole out there when they do that shit.  Because it's like, look.  You're supposed to be taking care of customers, not scold them.  Because maybe they didn't see the sign.  Scolding.  You've got to scold.  The job to scold me.  I go, what do I do now?  We all know that it says no cash.  Now I realize that. 
[01:12:00]  So what do we do now?  Oh, that's exactly the attitude.  Yeah, yeah.  What did you have to do?  I'm not going to be perfect.  The 99 out of 100 times, I'm going to do exactly what I need to do.  You know, and you're not going to have to worry about me.  Yeah.  Do you bag your own groceries at the supermarket?  Yeah, I try.  I don't.  Why?  Because it takes so long when they do it.  I don't give a shit.  I'm terrible at it, first of all.  I don't know that whole thing of what to put in what, where, when, why.  So after you check out and you're done, everything's rung up, will you stand there and watch the bag? 
[01:12:30]  Oh, I will fucking stand there and watch her bag my shit.  You just stand there.  And you know what it should tell them?  Get back to fucking getting the bag boys or something.  That's right.  I got duty.  We got bag boys.  And get that shit.  You don't have bag boys.  Very rarely.  Sometimes you see them.  Sometimes they'll wander off.  Usually they're talking to one of the checkout people.  Ah, I got the pinwheel today.  Get the fuck back here.  Drool on my shit and put it in a bag.  You're pretty good, though.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:13:00]  Although, a funny bit, you're not representing those people right.  No?  Their brains are wired to do one thing.  Well, that is true.  And it is to get your shit in bags.  It's like the Rubik's Cube of bagging.  They know their shit.  They can't drive home and they can't count to ten.  But, man, they know that task.  No.  And they will talk about that task for all day long.  I bag grocery.  Do you?  I bag the grocery.  No, you can't.  You have to double bag that.  Double bag for the frozen food or a leak.  You brought this to our attention years ago. 
[01:13:30]  You brought it to our attention years ago.  I'd much rather have one of those guys than some asshole fucking 18-year-old douchebag  that has no desire to be there.  You said it about the McDonald's lady.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where she got your order perfectly right.  She got it perfect.  Because that's all she knows in her head.  Yeah.  What happened with your cash-only thing?  Did they ring you up or did they make you go somewhere else?  Well, they had to make it clear that it said no cash.  But, obviously, they could.  Wait.  I'm trying to remember the details.  Now I'm confused. 
[01:14:00]  Or did it say cash-only?  Whatever.  I had to go and she had to, let's say, take my credit card.  So maybe I did have a credit card.  Oh, maybe you did.  And I think that's what it was.  I did have my wallet with no money in it.  But, okay, so she now had to fucking, you know, use my credit card.  It's no big fucking deal, man.  Oh, I got you.  You know, that meant she had to do something.  Yeah.  Well, self-checkout.  But she had to scold me.  The sign says cash-only.  Cash-only.  I guess it was cash-only. 
[01:14:30]  That's what it was.  Okay.  I fucked up my own story.  But still, she's fucking made a big deal.  She didn't have to.  Yeah.  Cunt.  If I saw the sign, obviously, you know, I wouldn't have done what I did.  But you wanted to make sure you learned your lesson before she helped you.  But I made sure I go, it's not your job to scold me.  I go, okay, now what do we do?  Because now we all know that I did it wrong.  Are you going to help me or should I just leave this shit here?  Because I don't give a fuck.  Oh, what, sir?  You should have just said, do your duty.  Oh, do your duty.  Do your duty. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, I got in the poker.  That stiff fucking finger.  I hate that.  It's just, no one likes it.  It's terrible.  Get your, do your duty.  That's a good one.  The whole crew's doing it.  It's almost there.  Yeah, everyone does it.  It's almost there.  It's fun.  I'm working on it.  The, um, remember the conversation the other day with the lovely and talented Melinda?  Well, she's texting, the old people come to the bank daily just to fucking socialize. 
[01:15:30]  That's another place, the bank.  To go into the fucking bank and have somebody there that's trying to exchange fucking Klingon money for something they could spend here on earth.  Right.  Why?  Why do I feel so good about myself when I'm like, here's what I'm doing.  Bam, here's the paperwork, transaction, done.  I feel like I should turn around and go, that's how it's done!  Well, I agree.  Very angry.  I agree and disagree.  I mean, we, we're old enough to remember where, like, going to the post office or going to the bank sort of was a social experience a little bit. 
[01:16:00]  Oof.  You would, you would catch up with the, you know, the guy or the gal behind the counter.  I know the gal at the bank, but I don't sit there and chit-chat over the period of time that the transaction takes.  Well, you gotta, you gotta be skilled at it.  And the teller should not sit there and stop what she's doing to continue chatting.  I saw one, she's like, counting out some money, and then the woman said something, and then she stopped counting, and she's like, you know, at that age, they are, and I'm like, do I? 
[01:16:30]  Keep counting!  What are you doing?  You just don't, I get the socializing, but you gotta keep it to a minimum.  And keep it during the work process.  I don't like that everything has become robotic.  I don't mind a little human interaction.  I don't know, I kinda like robotic.  A little chit-chat.  A little bit.  I tweet about this last week.  I got sorta killed for it, and others sort of agreed.  I guess there's a, there's a, what am I trying to say? 
[01:17:00]  Well, basically it's the ATMs.  Yeah.  And when you get behind someone, and they have to do the combination to make sure they're out.  We all push extra buttons after we get our money out of the ATM, but those people like cancel, clear, exit.  Yeah.  Well, let me do it again.  Exit, cancel, clear.  They're just positive that, that their info is still in the ATM.  Just walk away.  And that you can just add on to it, and then take more.  You have to swipe your card again, they don't realize that. 
[01:17:30]  You gotta swipe the card again.  But, I mean, fair enough.  We all hit maybe an extra cancel or two to just make sure, but those people that are trying  to figure out the right combo before they can actually walk away.  Cancel as I'm walking away, I'm like, there you go.  And you're good, right?  Gone, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it pisses me off when I have to slide my card again sometimes.  I've never had a situation where I was just able to keep going with a new transaction.  Those people, and you watch, I'm like, all right, what combination is going to be good  enough for you to now walk away with your money?  Lunatics.  Oh, it's crazy. 
[01:18:00]  You can see the OCD working with their fingertips.  Well, I'm going to do it this way just to make sure.  I'm going to push two cancels, one exit, and one clear.  And that part of the bank where it's not the tellers, it's the desks.  There's never anywhere, like, there's no line.  There's no clear set place to stand.  You're just kind of hanging out in their office waiting for someone to invite you to their  chair.  And they're always working.  There's no set place.  But it's fake working.  It is fake working.  A lot of these people have power trips, so they're like, I know he's waiting for me, 
[01:18:30]  but, you know, I'll make him wait a couple minutes.  It's like I'm just standing in their workplace waiting.  Right, because it'll make me feel better about myself.  Like a hobo.  Oh, I could help him right now, but I'm going to make him wait 30 seconds.  Can I help you?  And then they finally look up, yes?  Yeah, yeah, yes.  Can I help you?  Oh, God.  There's so many things out there that are just frustrating.  Why you got the SiriusXM Help Twitter account up?  This is just when we were talking about SiriusXM Help.  A lot of complaints. 
[01:19:00]  Let me see.  Yeah, but the problem is it closes.  There's a rumor that someone deletes tweets from that.  What?  Twitter account.  I don't know if they deleted it or not.  They close.  And then they say we'll be back.  Go to the top.  What do you mean they close?  They say we'll be back tomorrow at 9 a.m.  How does a fucking tweet?  It defeats the purpose of having a Twitter account.  A Twitter account closes?  Wait, they're only available during business hours?  That's hilarious.  Our Twitter accounts were available 24 hours a day, basically.  Nine hours ago, they posted a tweet, we'll be back tomorrow at 9 a.m. 
[01:19:30]  They stink.  So they don't want you tweeting off hours?  That's like 12 hours a day they're closed, almost.  Wow.  They're only open for like 12 hours.  Wow.  I would imagine that a SiriusXM help, whether it's a person, a phone line, or a Twitter account,  should be available pretty much all the time.  You just put it on like four people's phones and then they'll just tweet.  And they're only available at 9 Eastern.  That means 6 a.m. out west?  That's right.  So those people get fucked for three hours. 
[01:20:00]  That's horrible, dude.  It's horrible.  So if you're in L.A., they don't like to acknowledge that this thing goes across the country, by the way.  They're obsessed with the East Coast.  I've been trying to argue that point, too.  But you don't think that they do a good job of...  Oh, God, no.  They just think it's an East Coast company, I guess.  It's not the case.  I've tried to move this show a little bit because, you know, we could get people live.  We could be live for people on the West Coast.  There's opening Anthony fans out in California.  Of course there are.  I've encountered many.  Too much bitching. 
[01:20:30]  Gotta keep the bitching to a minimum.  Bitching.  Try it.  This is a bitching show.  It's bitching.  It is bitching.  Yeah.  It's righteous, too.  I can't believe SiriusXM help on Twitter has 1,600 followers.  Who's following that account?  You know who's following them?  Who?  Sex man.  Sex man.  No, he's not.  Why would you follow them?  You're so needy.  What's wrong with you? 
[01:21:00]  He loves SiriusXM.  Why do you do that, here?  I swear I saw him last night.  It's bothering you.  Na, na, na, na, na, na, na.  Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na.  I'm sorry.  I didn't wear the match shirt today.  I got it.  Na, na, na, na, na, na.  This guy called SiriusXM.  He just hung up, unfortunately.  But I see what he wanted to talk about.  We didn't get to him in time.  Called SiriusXM customer service.  They couldn't give me the number to Alt Nation after they played the same concert three days in a row. 
[01:21:30]  Three days in a row.  That was a good concert.  Yeah, it must have rocked.  It must have been one of those special concerts they do.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Ebrock loves SiriusXM on Twitter accounts.  Does he really?  Loves them.  I got a headache today.  It's like Procter & Gamble.  Follow us on Twitter.  What for?  And Facebook.  Oh, for what?  Like some things there's just, you know.  No reason to.  Follow Midas Muffler.  Why?  Yeah, for what?  They're going to say. 
[01:22:00]  Our mufflers are quiet.  Oh, wow.  He tweeted this again.  Good.  That's a great tweet.  I want to retweet that.  I want to retweet that.  That's great.  Well, why don't we find one of those accounts and read some of the tweets?  They would be terrific.  Yeah.  Let's see if Midas.  Posse Vax got one, I think.  Let's see.  Do they really?  But that would be kind of funny.  Let's go to Midas.  See if Midas has a Twitter account.  Midas.  I got a headache.  What's the aspirin to take?  Excedrin.  Extra strength.  I got to get some Excedrin.  Anacin.  Anacin.  Anacin.  Remember Anacin?  Anacin.  That's what Nana has.  Who bought them up?  Anacin.  Did Avril buy them?  Did they? 
[01:22:30]  Yep.  Somebody did.  Anacin.  Back in 1986, I believe.  What do you got?  Some guy tweets, getting my oil changed at Midas in Kenosha.  And that's retweeted by Midas.  All right.  Midas.  Some guy's actually monitoring that to go, oh, look, a muffler tweet.  Can people tweet Midas and tell them you get an oil change so they retweet you?  Yeah.  That would be hilarious today.  Okay.  Hold on.  What else?  What are some of the other Midas tweets?  How many followers do they have? 
[01:23:00]  They have 311 followers.  Not bad.  Righteous.  Not bad.  All right.  Your engine needs to keep its cool during long summer drives, too.  Your car's engine cooling system.  How it works.  All right.  With a link.  That's good.  Like that.  All right.  I'm going to tweet to Midas.  I want some of the retweets they do.  Those are the funny ones.  Meg.  What does Meg write?  Customer service done well at Midas.  Booked appointment online.  Email follow-up.  Then an email from the owner to say thank you. 
[01:23:30]  Excellent.  I will bet a lot of money that Meg works for Midas.  I bet Meg works for Midas.  Yeah.  They're trying to push the Twitter account forward a little bit.  You got another retweet.  Come out and get your car washed by the lovely ladies of Sigma Chi this Saturday, 9 to 3 p.m.  at Midas on 4680 whatever in Florida.  Yeah.  She's an employee of Midas.  That's obvious.  But Midas retweeted that, huh?  I see.  Just got a call from Midas reminding me that my inspections do.  Why don't more people call me to remind me of things? 
[01:24:00]  Oh, boy.  You're going to kill yourself for the big retweet.  Yeah.  But they got the big retweet.  Oil change is done.  I love my local Midas because their service is exceptional.  Happy loves to come with me as well as their pet friendly commercial.  Let me just see Happy Panda.  It's his retarded kid.  He's eating a shoe.  Midas of Bloomington is on it today. 
[01:24:30]  Free Wi-Fi and coffee with an oil change for $23.  Hell, yeah.  Hashtag customer review.  Hashtag trust the Midas touch.  This is a fucking commercial.  They're not real people.  Who the fuck writes this stuff?  There's two possibilities.  Most of them are not real people, but I bet there are a few that just are on Twitter to get retweets.  Oh.  And so they're like, oh, shit.  Maybe if I compliment Midas.  Trust the Midas touch.  How empty is someone?  Were they actually? 
[01:25:00]  Oh, man.  Did anybody ever favorite a Midas retweet?  Favorite.  What did Jessica say?  What did that twat say?  Thank you, Midas, for having Wi-Fi here while I wait for my brakes to be repaired.  Should have brought the laptop, too.  Oh, God.  Yeah, that's the best.  You search for stuff.  They can't track your IP address.  People think everybody at Midas is looking at child porn.  Midas.  I hope they cut her brake lines.  Waste of life she is. 
[01:25:30]  She's really terrible.  She stinks.  Because it wasn't supposed to be Wi-Fi for her.  She tapped into the fucking manager's one, so his connection was slow.  So he drains her brake fluid.  She's fucking paralyzed on the way home.  Jesus.  Why are they all women?  I don't know.  Our listeners should see if this is fake or not and try to get their own Midas retweet.  Well, I actually tweeted something to get retweeted.  Oh, good.  I did.  What did you write?  Well, you have to go on and look at that Midas.  And hopefully they'll retweet it?  Let's hope so.  Now, go to the at Midas mentions.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Who's fucking Midas? 
[01:26:00]  You a big fan?  I fucking love Midas's Twitter.  Everybody follow Midas.  Let's see.  Oh, CokeLogic says, I think I'll get an oil change at Midas.  Midas is the right place for me and my family.  Ew.  Oh, they will definitely retweet that.  I hate Nancy Grace says, at Midas, you've got the Midas touch or something.  Oh, there's Jim's.  Jim Norton had a great experience at Midas.  Curtis Steph, Good Prices, Felching, and a friendly follow-up. 
[01:26:30]  Felching.  Do you think they'll retweet it without knowing what Felching is?  They probably will.  They'll say, oh, man, that's a celebrity, Jim Norton.  Felching has to do with a catalytic converter.  I think he's right.  Good news.  Five new tweets to Midas.  My Uncle Paul was a mechanic.  He gave me the Midas touch.  Who is that?  They should get credit.  Gumby.  Gumby with an eight instead of a B.  Gotcha.  Stupid Midas.  Midas.  What do you, make stuff gold or something? 
[01:27:00]  Getting my dick waxed at Midas.  Oh, six new tweets from Midas.  Getting my rear end checked out at Midas.  Someone from Midas took a shit in my ashtray when I was there for an oil change.  Hashtag tsk tsk.  A shit in his ashtray.  Thank you, at Midas, for saving my car from an engine prolapse. 
[01:27:30]  Any more tweets coming in?  Let's see.  Oh, porn, porn, porn, porn tweets.  Midas can suck it.  Nice.  Let's see.  Somebody replying to your Midas.  What?  No happy ending.  Got a rim job at Midas.  You could eat off my asshole.  That's a clean asshole.  Do you think that people are going to be looking at this going, like, the Midas Twitter checker?  Yeah.  Yeah.  1,700 new mentions. 
[01:28:00]  Well, looks like we're doing something right in marketing.  Business is booming.  Let me look at some of these.  10 new tweets.  Midas, that don't make no sense.  Okay.  Midas in going to get an oil change at Midas with my Uncle Paul.  I need work on my special pipe.  I got my dick rubbed and tugged at Midas.  That's nice.  Sandusky redefined the Midas touch.  I love to murder small animals with my coworkers here at Midas. 
[01:28:30]  I had a great break job at Midas, but then you raped me with a tire.  A tire?  I don't know.  22.  20 more Midas mentions.  I got my dick stuck in my muffler today at Midas.  All right.  Not saying I'm as personally responsible for this attack at Midas.  I wish Midas would make a muffler for Jim Norton's gassers. 
[01:29:00]  Wow.  Jesus.  Oh, boy.  Let's see how many more.  Best service I've ever had, except for that hooker at Midas.  All right.  At Midas, that nigga Chip got no neck.  Remember the world.  Sorry, Mom's comments.  That made us howl.  At Midas, my engine is dry.  Oh, see?  Edgar.  No, dude, I hate oil. 
[01:29:30]  Let's see.  19 new tweets.  All right.  20 new tweets.  Okay.  Midas is finding out what hashtag Jocktober is.  Somebody at Midas put a pink sock in the muffler.  I always use Midas for matters concerning the training.  Guys, they're coming in now.  I guess the delay caught up, huh?  Well, good.  Now we can't even keep track of them.  Midas had to look in my trunk. 
[01:30:00]  My trunk.  Oh, get it?  That's a chip I had.  Let's see.  Oh, 40 new tweets.  This is not good.  They are really going to be so happy.  For a minute.  Yeah.  They'll be happy until they hit the at mention button.  Yeah.  I got my unit sucked clean at Midas.  They'll wonder, like, why would anybody do this?  Yeah, yeah.  Like, why Midas?  We didn't like your fucking corny wheat treats.  They're awful.  Thanks, at Midas, for checking out the viscous fluid coming from my undercarriage. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, the viscous fluid.  Car caught on fire killed wife and kids after oil was changed at Midas.  I don't think they're going to re-sweet that one.  I don't think that will get re-sweeted at all.  No, this one, more than just Midas, is going to be unhappy.  At Midas, thanks for the handy job by David the intern at your New Jersey shop.  His hands were silky smooth.  Hashtag Jewish cum. 
[01:31:00]  At Midas, picking up a new Pasty back.  Oh.  Well, a lot of new tweets.  A lot of new ones coming in.  Well, enjoy that, Midas.  Yeah, have fun with that.  Yeah, that's a great...  Are they getting followers out of this bit?  I don't think so.  No.  How many followers are they up to now?  Let's take a look at Midas.  Everybody should follow Midas and then unfollow them.  They're still holding even at 311. 
[01:31:30]  Unchanged.  Oh, they'd be all happy that they got new followers.  Who's Midas following?  Let's find out.  Oh.  Yeah, everybody follow Midas and then within 24 hours, unfollow.  They're only following 11 people?  Yeah.  Paul Baird.  AAA Automotive.  Midas Nashville.  Good, the franchises have their own Twitter.  Who's Shelby Fix?  Consumer Reports.  Hootsuite.  My Midas guy.  JetBlue.  JetBlue.  What else?  They're following Twitter and Biz Stone. 
[01:32:00]  Who's my Midas guy?  What is he?  My Midas guy.  I guess this is, please follow at Midas.  We have moved all our Twitter action here.  Oh, action.  Must be the old Midas guy.  Oh, Twitter action.  There's a lot of action happening on Twitter.  There is a lot of action happening for Midas today.  Who's Paul Baird?  Let's find out.  Oh, boy.  They got 45 followers out of this bit.  That number just went up.  I don't know who Paul Baird is.  He's an idiot from Oklahoma. 
[01:32:30]  All right.  We're going to break.  I'm going to go wee-wee.  How about Paul Donkied?  Oh, jeez.  I'm going to take a bear.  Remember yesterday, Jim and Ant doing the Penn State fight song?  I remember that.  Much to the chagrin of Penn State alumni.  Yes.  This is Midas well jump.  With Dr. Dave being attributed to the quote.  Midas well jump.  Pretty funny.  Oh, actually, E-Rock, you got something?  You want to do that George Carlin thing instead?  Sure, if you want. 
[01:33:00]  All right, we'll do the, Jim and Ant did a great take on the Penn State fight song, and  now it's produced.  Yeah.  A little production piece.  We'll do that after the break, but first, George Carlin with some wisdom.  Here is another pack of jack-offs who ought to be strangled in front of their children.  People who pay for inexpensive items with a credit card.  You know?  Folks, take my word for this.  Raisinets is not a major purchase. 
[01:33:30]  Get some fucking cash together.  No one should be paying a bank 18% interest on Tic Tacs.  And you're holding up a fucking line, too.  Some dorky-looking prick with a fanny pack waiting to be approved for a bag of cheese doodles.  I need this like I need an infected scrotum.  Get some fucking money.  The next guy ahead of me online pays for Newsweek with a credit card.  He's getting stabbed in the eyes.  Good evening. 
[01:34:00]  Hi, this is Penn Jillette.  Hey, this is Tony Clifton.  Hey, this is Russell Peters.  Hi, this is Pat Cooper, and you're listening to the one and only Opie and Anthony.  Thank you, Pat.  Pat Cooper's going to be here in about 45 minutes.  Looking forward to that.  I hate missing Pat Cooper, man.  I really do.  Did you miss him last time, too?  No, I don't think so.  Okay, so you're good.  You're good for a while.  Pat Cooper is a fucking...  He's 82 years old.  What a veteran, man. 
[01:34:30]  I love fucking Pat Cooper.  He has more energy than any of us.  I need a nail clipper.  What?  I need a nail clipper.  Why?  What happened?  Because my nail broke, and it's hanging there, and I have a thing where I can't concentrate  on anything but how bad this is.  I'll bite it.  Oh, boy.  No, get away, Edgar.  Edgar!  No, get away!  Why won't you just bite that shit off?  No, I can't.  It just doesn't work that way.  I need a clipper or an emery board.  Do we have any of that stuff here? 
[01:35:00]  There's an emery board.  We're shark jocks.  We don't have that shit.  Yeah, I know.  Just rip it out, you fucking pantsy.  No, I can't.  Jesus Christ.  I can't.  Son of a bitch.  Son of a bitch.  You ever have good intentions with that type of thing, and by the end, it's a horror show?  I can't have that.  Half your nail's gone, there's a long red strip on the side of your finger, and all you want  to do is just pull a little thing off?  I can't.  There you go.  I can't bite my nails.  Oh, my God.  What the hell's happening here?  Bite your nails.  I don't bite my nails. 
[01:35:30]  It's like coming apart.  It's one thing I've...  You see fucking nail come apart like that?  Sal.  I'm going to Chicago next Friday.  What?  I just decided to see Sabbath.  Yeah?  So you're going to be there two weeks in a row?  Yeah, but I was telling Troy, I've never flown anywhere to see a show, but it's their  only U.S. show.  Why?  Personally, I think because of Tony's treatment.  I'm guessing that they kept it limited.  His touring is probably going to be limited.  Is Tony playing?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, very cool.  We don't know if Bill's on drums, but I mean, Tony had cancer, so... 
[01:36:00]  And what's up with Bill?  Well, they had a contract dispute or some shit.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah.  Look at this young lifesaver.  Why do they have contract disputes when they're at their level?  Lawyers.  But those guys have more money than they'll ever spend.  Why can't they just figure that shit out at that point?  I don't know, and I keep hearing different details about, like, you never know who's  fault.  It's easy to blame the band, but then I'm like, well, no, Bill asked for that.  I just don't know.  I just fucking don't know.  That's too bad.  But that's going to be cool.  But this is what a dummy I am.  I said, I want to go see Sabbath, and Troy goes, yeah, why don't you see if you can get 
[01:36:30]  an interview or something?  I'm like, oh, yeah.  I am on Ozzy's Boneyard.  Like, what a dope.  I really don't think like that.  You know, it's like, maybe I can get a pass for the show, and I don't think that maybe  I should try to talk to one of them.  Fucking asshole.  By the way, this is the dumbest nail clipper I've ever seen in my life.  Why?  Because look which way it's bent.  It curves the opposite way of the fingernail.  Oh, I hate those.  I don't get those.  Why do they make these?  I don't know.  I had to really, you just got to take off a little nubby at a time, little, little bit 
[01:37:00]  at a time.  Look, it curves this way.  It curves up.  Right?  That's one of those that curves up.  Don't keep looking at it that way.  Go look at it this way.  Yeah.  See, it goes like this.  I don't know why they do that.  Where your nail would fit in, because your nail's curved this way.  I've never had...  This way, you just get...  They're always like that with me.  I bet you that's so you don't clip them too far.  Yeah.  Really?  I don't know.  Imagine pinching the head of your cock with that.  No.  Imagine just fucking snipping the head of your cock with that fucking thing. 
[01:37:30]  No.  I don't want to do that.  That's weird.  You grab half the hole.  No.  No.  I would hate something in my pee hole.  Oh, God.  I don't want that ever.  No.  Good news in San Francisco.  Oh!  The library out there installs computer privacy screens for most discreet porn viewing.  Exactly.  I guess they were having a problem, because people would...  I can't believe people are such old school where they go to the library...  Library for porn?  ...to check out some porn.  So they finally said, all right, this is happening. 
[01:38:00]  We've got to get some screens up so other people aren't offended by what people are viewing  on their library computers.  Well, only San Francisco would do that, too.  Yeah.  To appease people that...  What is that?  It's pretty cool, actually.  What is that?  That's, uh...  That's our intern, Rob, the handsome one with the webbed feet.  Yeah.  Dressed up as Uncle Paul for Halloween before he was interning here.  No kidding.  Oh, my God.  I kind of like that.  It's a good costume.  Fuck him.  Who's that? 
[01:38:30]  Yeah, I didn't...  That's what I meant.  Thank you, Ant.  I'm looking at the blonde.  Oh.  Who is that bitch?  That's what I meant.  Who is she?  You'd have to ask handsome, webbed-footed...  Hey, can you swim in here?  I want to ask him.  If he's...  I don't like that costume.  He's a very handsome kid.  And he's confident.  We talked about this yesterday.  Here comes Rob.  Is he the one that made fun of Sal?  Who the fuck is that?  Oh, yeah.  This is Rob.  I like Rob.  He's got the webbed feet.  But him and Sal made up yesterday, big time.  Ah, cool.  Because Sal doesn't like complications. 
[01:39:00]  A little peter-pumpin'.  I don't know.  I didn't really hear much making up.  Sal's got glasses.  They almost haunt.  There was no hug.  Rob.  No, he hugged his leg.  Rob.  Who's the blonde?  I don't give a fuck what you're dressed like.  Who is she?  That's this girl named Allie.  You stuck it in her?  Of course, the name's Allie.  Are you banging her?  As Uncle Paul.  Did you really?  That's fucking badass.  Hey, man.  You got fucking great.  Why would you do that with such an old lady?  Great.  Zoom in a little there, young Sam.  You got nothing but respect. 
[01:39:30]  As Uncle Paul, you got it in.  Wow.  As they say on the Jersey Shore, you got it in.  She's pretty, man.  How many times have you banged her?  Just once.  Why only once?  She was really drunk.  That's why.  Oh, okay.  Date rape.  Nice.  Drunk enough to bang a guy dressed up as a pedophile.  Uncle Paul, yeah.  Well, she probably did.  I liked it.  My favorite part of that is how fucking creepy your hand is.  Yeah, yeah.  You got your hand all kind of arthritised up.  That's the way it is.  You got to reach under.  You hold the calf while you're manipulating their ankles. 
[01:40:00]  What did you tell people?  When people said, who are you?  Like, what are you for Halloween?  I just said I was a pedophile.  No one knew?  No one really knew Uncle Paul.  Good to know.  The show's alive and well out there.  Some did.  Some did.  We're going to have a chip contest up there in Chicago.  Yeah, chip off the old one.  Because you did a great job with Uncle Paul, and it just got me to thinking, what are we  doing in Chicago?  Did she blow you?  Yeah.  Eat her ass?  Was it good?  I wish.  Do you eat her pussy?  Yeah.  Why didn't you eat her ass?  I don't know.  She just didn't like it. 
[01:40:30]  What?  She just had a couple fingers in there.  She didn't like it.  Oh, no wonder.  You don't stop.  You don't stop with a couple fingers in the asshole.  You kiss the cheeks.  Jesus.  You work your way into the hole.  You don't just.  He was in character.  I was in character.  Oh, all right.  That's why your fingers are like this.  You got to tickle that shit for a while.  You lick the bone, but then you kind of pin her legs back a little, and you fucking  just keep going down further and further until you have your tongue on her tailbone.  Yeah.  And while you're jabbing the asshole, you actually look up, and you go, coochie-coo.  I don't think that's it.  And you poke the anus. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, you make a joke.  That loosens them up.  Like, if you put the finger in there, I'll look up, and I'll say something funny like,  I better not feel anything poking me back from in here.  And then they laugh, right?  I've actually felt that in my life where I'm fingering an asshole, and I felt like the tail  of a Manx cat.  I'm like, oh, boy.  Someone's got a dude.  Someone's got one in the chamber.  Nothing worse than a chick with a shit in the chamber. 
[01:41:30]  That's hilarious.  I've never heard of a scribe like that before.  Shit, man.  All right, Rob.  We got this.  We don't need you.  All right.  You look good, boy, Rob.  You look good in your costume, and she's hot as shit.  There you go.  She is pretty.  So you don't think you'll ever fuck her again?  Actually, no.  It's almost a year.  Maybe.  Where does she live?  What town?  She lives in southern New Jersey.  Oh, cool.  You got any naked pictures of her?  No.  Do you have a picture of her ass?  I'll try.  Can I have a picture of her ass? 
[01:42:00]  I'd love to see it.  She has big forearms.  What does she play?  A lot of tennis?  Do you know her?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  She goes to my school.  Oh, okay.  How was the head?  It was good.  It was great.  Was she sloppy and wet?  Did she apologize?  I'm sorry.  The part of your balls is so cool.  I don't need to apologize.  It's fine.  You know what?  This Rob guy is a little cocky, Sam.  He's very cocky.  He just grabbed the computer.  I can see it.  He doesn't give a fuck.  He's cock-sure.  Yeah.  You're going to do all right in this world.  Thank you.  Is that her?  See, you said that, and he's not even like, oh, wow. 
[01:42:30]  That's great.  That's her daughter.  No, because he already knows her.  She just knows.  Does she get a boyfriend now, though?  Oh, man.  Come on.  Holy fuck.  Holy Toledo.  What the fuck?  Who does she look like?  She looks like shit.  She looks like a movie star.  She almost looks like when Tara Reade was in good shape.  Or a little bit of Emma Stone in it.  No.  Who are we thinking?  Fuck.  She's a very cute girl, man.  Who does she look like?  Thank you.  Does she have a boyfriend, or you don't know?  I don't know.  Why don't you get in there and say, hey, I'd like to be your significant other. 
[01:43:00]  Jesus Christ.  Holy shit.  And why don't you want to be tied down with this one?  I don't know.  Just things didn't really pan out the way I thought.  What happened?  Did you lose your erection, Rob?  Premature ejaculation?  What happened?  Yeah, what happened?  Did you cum on her leg while you were hugging her?  Did you fucking shoot your load all over her inner thigh?  Yeah.  She shook his hand and he came on top of her feet.  There's nothing a girl hates more than when you cum on the top of her foot.  Shaved pussy all the way?  Yeah.  Nice.  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  That's the way to go.  Yeah, I agree. 
[01:43:30]  Nice tits.  Which one is she in this picture?  Middle.  Middle one.  Who's the one on the right, too?  She's cute, too.  I have no clue.  With the big flower on her tit.  Get out of it.  Tell Ali I want the one on the one.  You can fuck the one in the middle.  I'll take the one on the end.  And the one on the left?  Go get coffee.  Yeah, get some coffee with your Kristen Stewart face.  Coffee for the men.  It reminds me of cheating.  Yuck.  She's a...  Wow.  Hi, Rob.  That's a pretty girl there, that blonde.  We don't need you anymore.  That happened.  Can I?  Just...  Man.  You know, when I first heard of Robert Pattinson, I said, I do, too, Rob. 
[01:44:00]  Pattinson, see?  He's making light of it.  It's terrible that he does it.  Someone's got to say it.  What?  He didn't fuck her.  Stop.  You don't think so?  You think he's lying?  No way.  He's got game, though.  But how do we prove it?  He's got the looks and the game.  How do we prove it?  Let's smell his fingers.  If he fucked you, he probably still hasn't washed his hands.  I know I wouldn't.  I hope he can't hear us right now.  But how can we prove it?  You're probably right about him lying.  I think he might be lying.  Why?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think so.  You'd have to get in touch with that.  That's the only way.  One time, didn't work out. 
[01:44:30]  Eh, something's...  He lost his rod.  He's a tiny cock.  Something suspicious there.  Oh, I think he's small?  Came too soon.  I don't know.  Little dick.  I bet he is.  Lost his rod.  Maybe.  I'm thinking maybe they made out a Halloween party, whatever, but something suspicious.  Maybe she gave him a handy.  She's like just tweedling his little fucking soft dick between her thumb and forefinger going,  Oh, what's wrong?  No, it's cute.  He's like, this never happens to me.  But I want to fuck. 
[01:45:00]  Oh.  And she's just going, and it's just going, floop, floop, floop, floop, floop.  Floop.  Floop, floop, floop, floop.  When can we fuck?  Would you fuck her?  Holy shit.  I think.  Yes.  I think he was exaggerating.  The answers came too quickly.  I think he hooked up.  So did he.  I think he might have hooked up a little bit.  Yeah, I don't think he fucked her.  I think he just hung out.  I'd go back for seconds. 
[01:45:30]  Absolutely.  What does he say?  And then he casually goes, it didn't work out.  What didn't work out?  It's one night.  You can't even tell if it didn't work out until you've had a couple of nights.  He called her the next day, and she said, is this limpy?  Oh.  They're still friends on Facebook, so it's not like it ended bad.  So let's get a hold of her.  Because they're platonic.  How do we get a hold of her?  Hey, would it be mean to email her now and just say, hey, Rob, stay on the radio that he fucked you in the ass.  Oh, man.  Said he stuck some digits up your ass.  You didn't like it.  I think he definitely did not put any fingers in her.  Well, because he said, my first red flag was when he said a couple fingers in there. 
[01:46:00]  No fucking way.  Like it was no, yeah, put a couple fingers in there.  You think he's just trying to be one of the guys?  Yeah, there's no way.  He'll just casually put a couple fingers in there.  Not in that ass.  And if she didn't want ass play, get the fuck out of here.  Yeah.  If she could take a couple fingers, she's all about the ass play.  He's only 20.  He would have tried to make her his girlfriend or something like that.  Oh, Mike, he probably did.  That's what that picture is.  He's like, so you want to go out sometime?  You don't do it like that anyway.  You got to read like, you got to use your hands like fucking, like you're reading Braille sometimes. 
[01:46:30]  If you're going down on a girl, you could get your hands like right in that ass cracky thing there, right?  And you start kind of like pulling them up towards you, but you creep with your fingers a little bit.  And if they start like going, hey, I think I like that, and they start moving their ass over, then you know you're in.  You work your fingers like it's a wind instrument.  A wind instrument, like a woodwind instrument.  They try for a C note.  Stupid wind instruments. 
[01:47:00]  Wind instruments are awful.  A woodwind.  I think I played one.  What was the beginner one?  A clarinet?  No.  The beginner one.  A flutophone?  The beginner one.  A recorder?  Grammar school.  My joke got a zero.  Yeah, what happened?  Did you catch that, you're right?  I caught it.  It got a zero.  I missed it.  It was funny.  Damn it.  I hate when I miss those.  It was the penis.  Oh.  Penn State.  Dr. Steve gave us props on our Penn State discussion yesterday. 
[01:47:30]  What?  He did.  Well.  You want me to read the text?  Well.  He wrote.  Hmm.  Fucking fascinating discussion on Penn State today.  Best commentary on the subject I've heard anywhere.  Oh.  I gave him nothing.  I just wrote, thanks, Steve.  Oh, doctor.  And then he wrote, funny as fuck, too.  Meaning, trying to engage me in conversation.  And I wrote, gracias.  Oh, Jesus. 
[01:48:00]  That's all he got.  Why would you give him a little bit?  That's all he got.  That's not exaggerating.  Why wouldn't you give him a little bit?  That was his way of getting a little back and forth discussion going.  Now go be the middle man between life and the Grim Reaper.  Fucking whatever he does over there.  Ghoul.  Yeah, he really is.  He's the ferryman.  Fucking creep.  The ferryman.  Yeah.  Just don't even try to fix the price.  I'll get you to the side.  Bring it across the River Karen.  Or is it Charon?  Or I don't even know. 
[01:48:30]  Sticks.  That's a mile.  River Sticks.  You're right.  Some coins over the eyes.  Yeah.  Don't pay the ferryman.  Christa Byrd.  Anybody?  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Well, Kevin from Connecticut.  Don't even fix a price.  Until he gets you to the other side.  Sometimes he won't get you to the other side.  You'll wind up with fluid on your shoes.  Fluid.  Yeah.  It's like a tumescent boat.  Can you be sued for malpractice?  What would be malpractice in that?  Getting a pulse. 
[01:49:00]  A lot of work.  Getting a pulse?  Yeah.  Be like, oh, we got a pulse.  You didn't do your job.  This person's supposed to be dead.  Yeah.  Why don't we do this?  The Penn State fight song.  All right.  You guys had some terrific back and forth yesterday.  With the percentile fight song.  48?  Wow.  Really?  I have to leave in a second.  See, after this song.  Oh, you don't.  Oh.  Tomorrow night I'll be on Canadian TV.  The movie channel, I think, they're showing it live.  Saget's hosting it myself. 
[01:49:30]  Wow.  Cool.  Amy Schumer, Jimmy Carr, Mike Wilmot.  It's a very good show.  Very cool.  So let's see how this fucking Colorado material works.  You got a few?  Yeah, it's all I'm doing.  Oh, jeez.  Some stuff you quickly worked out.  Yeah, it's been doing good.  I'm actually really happy with it.  Nice.  Oh, my God.  Can we get a tape of that for Monday somehow?  I'll try.  I'd love to.  We'll figure it out.  Somebody out there taped Jimmy on Canadian TV doing his stand-up, and we'll play it on 
[01:50:00]  Monday.  That'd be awesome.  I'd love to hear that.  Here's the Penn State fight song redone by Anthony and Jimmy.  And now, as a halftime treat, please welcome Sirius XM radio personalities Anthony Cumia  and Jim Norton.  Here to sing the Penn State fight song.  Wherever true to you, dear, and our coach is a queer, finger in the air, sticking in a boy's 
[01:50:30]  high knee, and we'll cry when the degrees are taken away.  That's a reflection on us.  Points we will gain, while blood runs down the drain, and the boy's high knee is in pain.  What the fuck are we insane?  Go, team, go.  Make the young boys blow.  Watch Sandusky's erection grow.  Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, state, fight, fight, fight, fight. 
[01:51:00]  Mrs. Sandusky didn't see a thing, as I plowed it in his leather ring.  When he screams, it sounds like a sing, as he wraps his tight high knee around my ding-a-ling.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  My Heini hurds, quiet kid.  We'll hit that line.  Roll off the score.  Fight on to victory evermore.  Fight on.  Fight on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, Penn State. 
[01:51:30]  Oh, fuck yourself.  I didn't like my one line about the sing.  I fucked it up.  They should have took that out.  Oh, that's terrific, though.  I like that.  Don't be so hard on yourself.  No, but I like a good song.  I like it better in the context of just spontaneity.  Yeah, well.  It's almost like we sat and wrote a song and then went in the studio instead of it just happening. 
[01:52:00]  Sounds weird.  I mean, what's that?  We've got to repurpose.  Oh, don't do that.  Oh, God, Edgar.  We've got to repurpose audio.  Repurpose audio.  What is it called?  We have to repurpose audio.  Is that what they tell you guys?  Every week.  Why do they use repurpose?  They make everything so much fun.  They make it sound like fucking, yeah.  It's the funnest job ever.  As much as I bitch and we bitch, of course, this is one of the best things you could ever do with your life.  But they make it so much fun.  Repurpose the audio.  Why do they say repurpose the audio? 
[01:52:30]  That's what we're doing.  We're repurposing.  Bye, guys.  We repurpose them.  Repurpose.  I've never heard that before.  Jimmy's leaving with his suitcase.  Have a good trip, Jimmy.  Bye, Jimmy.  How are you getting to Canada?  Oh.  I have a ride to the airport.  Tightrope.  I'm taking a regional jet.  You're flying.  Yeah.  International flight.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Don't forget your passport.  Shut up.  Jim Norton has left the building.  No, I have.  You shut up.  Oh, boy.  Oh, he's poking him. 
[01:53:00]  I hate that poke.  Is Josh here today?  Is Josh here today, or is Josh leaving too?  Josh.  He hates it.  All right, Jim.  We'll see you Monday.  Here goes Jimmy Norton.  Good luck in Canada.  Pat Cooper coming up in about a half hour.  Yes.  But yeah, when you guys do stuff like that, it's got to be repurposed.  Repurposed.  Nice.  Repurposed.  I don't get repurposing, but...  What does that mean?  A new purpose?  But a repurpose means you're purposing it again.  We're taking an audio that at one point had a purpose and adding a new purpose to the 
[01:53:30]  same audio.  But how would that be repurposed?  You're repurposing it, meaning when they...  Purpose is sounding weird now.  When they did it spontaneously, it had a purpose, which was to spontaneously just riff.  Right.  Now we're repurposing that same audio as to be a song.  Didn't we used to just call it repackaging?  Yeah.  So why do they change it from repackaging, which doesn't sound douchey, to repurposing?  Well, because it's a new purpose to it.  Oh, God.  I don't know if it's a new purpose if you're repurposing. 
[01:54:00]  The purpose is to be entertaining.  You're doing it on purpose.  It's not an accident.  What's the re part of the purpose part?  Yeah.  Because it's got a new purpose.  There was two purposes to it.  The first purpose was spontaneous.  But you guys hear repurpose every week?  Oh, my God.  If I hear purpose again, I'll be fucking losing it.  I refuse to take a phone call today unless you work the word...  Purpose.  Or repurpose.  Work the word repurpose into it.  We might be able to repurpose this break into a bit.  I sure hope you can repurpose this.  Troy, if you're listening, let's make a repurpose bit.  How are you going to repurpose a repurpose bit? 
[01:54:30]  I don't know.  Or us discussing repurpose.  I don't know, but that's where the...  That would be some weird Matrix shit, I'm thinking.  Yeah.  Oh, we'll take that quote that you just did and put it at the front of it.  To start the repurpose?  Yep.  Of the repurpose bit?  Yes.  More discussion?  This is going to be repurposed.  Wow.  I'm very confused.  I don't like this at all.  You will once it's repurposed.  This purpose you don't like.  A repurpose you will.  A right with a purpose.  What's the difference between purpose and repurpose?  It's a second purpose.  Yeah.  Is that as simple as that? 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  The repurpose has a new purpose to what originally had a different purpose.  So, wait.  All right.  Let's break it down.  Reuse.  Reduce, reuse, recycle.  So you use something and then you reuse it.  Right.  So it's not a new purpose.  You're using it for the same shit.  No, because you're using it differently.  How are you using it differently?  To reuse it?  Sometimes you might use it in a different context.  Repurposing it is just changing the context.  And now it's repurposed. 
[01:55:30]  I don't get it.  I don't know what's going on.  Well, there you go.  There's the repurpose bit.  Why would Joe Theismann want to be known for running around stadiums trying to piss?  I don't know.  Instead of his legacy, which is a pretty good goddamn quarterback.  I'll tell you why.  Someone assumed that his money was going to last his entire life.  He ran out of money, obviously.  My prostate's driving me crazy.  He runs around stadiums looking for bathrooms.  And every broad wanted to bang him. 
[01:56:00]  And now he's on TV saying how he has to piss every five minutes.  I can't fucking take a lot of those commercials.  You know, Sam just left to tell Troy he's got to do a repurpose bit.  Repurpose for that?  I guess.  I hate repurposing.  I don't know why Theismann would do that.  Yeah.  I guess he needed the money.  It kind of makes you...  That's kind of then what they become remembered for.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because I remember that baseball player.  What's his name that had the corked bat incident there?  George Brett.  Yeah.  George Brett on fucking for hemorrhoid medicine or some shit. 
[01:56:30]  I said depends, but...  Yeah, well...  Hemorrhoid medicine.  Yeah, you're right.  Yeah, for like the roids.  Why would you admit you got roids?  Oh, yeah.  It was Pintar.  Sorry.  Yeah.  I said corked.  Well, I'm an asshole.  Who was the corked guy?  What do you want from me?  Who was the corked guy?  I'm a corked bat.  Lisa Renna does the fucking Depends now.  Well, you see her on the red carpet?  Yeah.  And then that husband of hers?  Oh, yeah.  Mr. Lisa Renna.  Has to say how good she looks in her Depends on the red carpet? 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  Because you can't see the Depends lines or something?  Please.  Why the fuck would you do that?  If you're wearing Depends, no one cares that you can't see the Depends lines.  And Wilford Brimley, yeah.  Yeah, you know, the guy was in a lot of major motion pictures, and now you're just known  for diabetes.  But maybe it pays very well.  Yes, E-Rock.  Foreman had the grill.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Just because Jimmy's not young.  We've got to continue that.  Well, George Foreman grill, I think that made him just as famous as the fights did. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, that one isn't as huge.  But see, E-Rock just didn't add anything to that.  No, because...  That one's not bad.  Yeah.  We're talking about the ones that are bad.  Embarrassing kind of thing.  George Foreman made way more money off the grill than he made fighting, I believe.  Yeah.  I just made that up, but I would assume it's close, if not more, money for the grill.  Yeah.  We're talking about diabetes.  Diabetes.  We're talking about the hemorrhoid cream.  Yeah, Sally Field and her fucking graham cracker bones. 
[01:58:00]  That shit.  Bone-iva.  My bone-iva.  Jamie Lee Curtis.  Jamie Lee Curtis with the shit yogurt.  Yeah.  That's a prime example.  Admitting she can't shit unless she eats her yogurt.  And they talk about it.  She goes, it really makes you active.  And she pushes down like she's pushing the shit out of herself.  She was in trading places, fucking topless.  With some of the best tits you've ever seen.  Now when you think Jamie Curtis, you think, oh, fuck, she can't shit.  Activia.  My shit yogurt.  She can't get the shit out of the chamber. 
[01:58:30]  When I'm fucking straining, that's how her hair turned gray in one day.  Like fucking Moses at the burning bush.  She fucking was straining so hard to take a shit, her hair turned gray.  She came out of the bathroom.  And now she takes Activia.  Oh, that's great.  Activia.  That's pretty funny.  Man.  Yeah, they do it.  But, I mean, Joe Theismann?  Joe Theismann's poor fucking prostate.  It's just doing spins inside of him.  What is this?  The top ten ridiculous? 
[01:59:00]  Yeah, but some of them, they didn't get famous for it.  They're just bad.  Oh, bad ideas.  Let's go.  What's number one?  Top ten.  All right, go.  Top?  Well, we'll start with ten.  I learned from the last time I got in trouble.  All right, what is this?  It's the top ten worst celebrity endorsements.  Okay.  Oh, it's the Paris Hilton fucking hamburger one?  Yeah, they're saying everything Paris Hilton has ever endorsed.  Right.  It's a little joke.  That's terrible.  Ozzy Osbourne.  I can't believe it's not butter.  Oh, can we hear this?  I don't remember this.  Did you do that one, right?  Yeah.  I don't remember this.  Do you?  Separate two eggs and add to the flour. 
[01:59:30]  I'm really digging this cooking vibe, man.  Okay, pass me the buzzer then.  All right, man.  Two Ozzy's.  Um, I can't tell the difference.  Tell me those.  Good.  And that's how you make fairy cakes.  Fairy cakes?  I'm the Prince of Darkness.  I'm doing rock cakes.  Yeah, me too, man.  I can't tell the difference.  Can you?  Wow.  I don't remember ever seeing that on the telly. 
[02:00:00]  I don't remember ever seeing that either.  All right.  Oh, there you go.  Kathy Lee Gifford.  And Walmart.  Dumb Walmart.  Mm-hmm.  Spots.  Turned out bad.  This is different than what we were talking about, but whatever.  Carney Wilson and the Fresh Diet.  How'd that work out for you?  Ah, she's fat all the time.  Big and fat.  Kardashian card.  They took out the MasterCard.  Yeah, they gave out, they put out their own credit card.  This is a Japanese commercial.  Yeah, Ben Stiller.  Yeah, that's stupid.  This is a dumb one.  This is dumb. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah, Hulk Hogan.  And the Ultimate Grill?  It more works what you're saying is Hulk Hogan and his Rent-A-Center commercials.  Oh, yeah, that's terrible.  Troy Aikman, too.  Rent-A-Center, brother!  And Troy Aikman's like, oh, what's Hulk doing?  Well, you signed on to do the commercials with him.  It's not like a surprise.  You got the scripts.  You rehearsed.  You know what he did?  He's always so surprised at Hulk being so crazy.  Somebody says that Hogan was offered the Foreman Grill before George Foreman.  He says he was, but he bullshits. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah, of course.  He made a rip-off Foreman Grill, and he probably claimed.  Yeah.  He also had a restaurant called Pasta Mania.  Oh, God, enough with the mania.  Hulk Hogan's Pasta Mania in the Mall of America didn't do well at all, no.  Oh, that's too bad.  People didn't go to it at all.  I feel bad for the Hulkster.  Yeah?  I kind of do.  Hulkster.  Was he back on TV for that Raw thing, or is he still involved with the other?  He's in TNA, so he couldn't be at Raw when passing.  What an idiot he is.  The guy's like...  What an idiot.  He was one of the biggest people in WWF slash E. 
[02:01:30]  Why would you just quit knowing that you'd be part of the big Raw show?  Especially since Raw was the top-rated, not cable program, but television program on Monday.  I heard it did like $8 million or something like that.  It did ridiculous.  What an idiot he is.  And he's still stuck on old TNA.  Where is it?  What is it?  Like 100-seat theaters?  They do it in a TV studio.  Oh, God.  They don't even go to places.  Universal Studios every week.  He was giant.  Oh, my God.  It's in a studio?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:02:00]  Do they have like a studio audience at least?  Yeah, they do.  Wait, do they bring people in that are doing the Universal Studios thing?  That's the problem with it.  Like they have a small, they have some TNA fans.  So it's not even wrestling fans.  But yeah, they do it like, you know.  It's like grandmas and kids and Disney people.  Universal people.  Yeah, Universal people.  So you got a guy out there trying to get people to come in.  Exactly.  For the big wrestling show.  Free take.  Ladies and gentlemen, the TNA wrestling show is going to be starting in 20 minutes.  So if you're online right now, that's great. 
[02:02:30]  If not, get online.  You're really going to enjoy the show.  We got Hulk Hogan.  Everybody, let's hear it for Hulk Hogan.  Hey.  Oh, man.  I feel bad.  Like, I'm going to go to the Hogwarts fucking ride.  Wow, he couldn't be part of the Raw show.  No.  So he wasn't on it.  Look at how sad that looks, Ant.  There's like maybe 200 people there.  The pyro for TNA.  Yeah.  You know when you're watching WWE and it goes off and it's in a big arena.  It's like, oh my God, like earth shattering.  Yeah.  When TNA does it, it sounds like it's echoing in a gym because the crowd's not even going nuts. 
[02:03:00]  No.  And there's times they're piping in crowd noise.  Okay.  I would assume they would do that.  You got a clip of that?  I would love to see it.  I don't want a match.  I just want like maybe some pyro or something.  Oh my God.  Some special effects.  I don't know because they don't even really have any intros.  So I'd have to.  That's like when you go to see the Wild West stunt show.  Yeah.  And the fucking Waterworld exhibit and stuff.  And then you go see TNA.  It's like, ladies and gentlemen, you are going to be part of a wrestling program. 
[02:03:30]  Your part is very important here.  We need action.  We need energy.  Back in the day, WCW used to do shows here and they actually had signs, like applause  signs that said cheer or boo.  Oh man.  And so it was like the guys are trying to get over it.  It was just not working.  Oh boy.  Just leave it to Vince.  Everyone else should just tap out.  Yeah, they should leave.  It's the impact zone.  And they do their pay-per-views out of there too for the most part. 
[02:04:00]  It's like there's no...  It's tiny.  Yeah.  It's sad.  And what?  The audience is only on one side of the ring?  Oh yeah.  I mean, they do the bleachers and stuff on one side because that way...  Yeah, they got everything else facing...  Oh, whatever.  That's where they put the hard cam on the other side.  Right.  So you don't notice it and then they darken it.  So it just looks like a fuckload of people.  It's not that many though.  But it's only one side of the ring.  Every seat's a good seat though.  There you go.  There's a plus.  Lemons.  Lemonade, my friend.  Hey, our pal Bill Burr does a terrific podcast like his podcast. 
[02:04:30]  The Monday morning, morning, Monday, Monday morning podcast, something like that, right?  Yeah.  He did a little thing on the gun control debate.  Like Bill.  By the way, I know Bill likes guns and wants guns and wants to shoot guns.  Yeah.  So, you know, whatever he says about this, eh.  All right.  So we'll keep our mics off.  Yeah.  Why do you think he might have a...  Oh, I don't know.  I don't know.  He might have a heel turn when it comes to guns here? 
[02:05:00]  He might.  I don't know.  I love Bill.  I've heard him.  He wants to go to the range with you.  I'm going to go see Bill at Caroline's.  I think it's September.  Yeah.  He canceled.  Caroline's, yeah.  Rescheduled for September.  He's fucking hilarious.  I love Bill.  Bill Burr on guns.  Then the NRA always has to immediately pile on after somebody uses a gun.  Like, this doesn't mean the gun did it.  Gun didn't do it.  Person did it.  Just letting you know.  Just in case you thought an inanimate object could somehow do shit on its own.  And then they always come up with the brilliant...  What if everybody was allowed to have a gun? 
[02:05:30]  Then that wouldn't have happened.  Yeah, I think that that guy would have killed less people.  But I think a lot more other people would have got killed getting shot in the back of the fucking head as people tried to shoot that person.  Right?  I'm not against guns, by the way, but like, you know...  Look, everybody can have a driver's license.  How many people really are good at driving?  How many people are good at sports?  How many people have good hand-eye coordination?  Do you want these fucking people with guns?  And all of a sudden somebody starts squeezing off some rounds, and those motherfuckers are between you and the guy shooting at you? 
[02:06:00]  And you're not organized at all.  You know, when like ten cops go in and storm a house, they know where the fuck they're at for a reason.  So they don't shoot each other in the back.  Like, if you've got a bunch of people in a goddamn movie theater with fucking Glocks, and somebody comes in and starts shooting, I mean, it's going to be a fucking...  It's going to be even worse.  I think what they should do is there's got to be two levels you have to pass to get a gun.  Okay?  Aside from not being a psycho, you should...  When you get a gun, you should then have to become a fucking marksman. 
[02:06:30]  All right?  And if you're not a marksman, then it affects the caliber of gun that you get.  But this actually makes a lot of sense.  It's like taking the driver's test.  You can't go there blind as a bat and they just give you a fucking goddamn car.  Like, dude, go fuck yourself.  Go down to Pearl Vision and get your game together.  They should do the same thing with guns.  Okay?  I want to get a gun license.  Well, God bless America.  You can have one.  Go over there to the gun range and go shoot at that silhouette over there. 
[02:07:00]  Right?  You know, if you only hit it once, you get a BB gun.  Or maybe one of those little toy guns that shoots the plastic things.  You can still put somebody's eye out, though, with it, you know?  But if you actually go down there and you're a fucking goddamn maniac, right?  Psycho fucking, you know, just everything's a headshot or center mass.  Then you get the Glock.  Right?  Does that make sense?  And you just have a safe word.  That makes sense.  Something the guy yells with shit like that, and everybody hits the fucking deck, and this 
[02:07:30]  guy gets up and just puts two right in the fucking psycho's head, and it's over.  As opposed to just letting everybody just start fucking shooting.  Would that make sense?  Oh, if everybody just thought the way I did, the world would be just as fucked up.  All right.  Bill Burr, everyone.  Nice.  Well, he's a very funny man, that Bill.  Yes.  I guess Pat Cooper's going to be on our show next.  Are you ready for this today? 
[02:08:00]  I'm never ready for Pat.  Yeah.  We have a lower energy today, which is fine.  I just make him...  So I don't know if today's a good day for Pat Cooper.  Well, he's not going to stand for it.  He's high energy.  I know he's not going to stand for it, so we've got to get our energy up before he gets  in here.  Ooh.  With some pixie sticks, like toddlers in tiaras.  Is that what they use?  Pixie sticks and fucking Red Bull.  They give these little kids...  And then they're like...  Sugar is a nightmare to a kid.  We're all crazed.  Holy fuck. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  That's their co-kind.  That is.  Holy fuck.  They give it to those kids nonstop.  They're just popping those fucking pixie sticks in their mouth.  Yeah.  And they get out there with their dumb fucking...  What's the most sugary thing you'll give to your kids?  Uh, you know...  Will you give them a pixie stick?  Yeah, sure.  Why not?  Have you ever seen them...  Sometimes you forget, and you give the kid sugar a little too late, and you're like,  oh, fuck, an hour.  It's going to take an hour for him to calm down easy. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah, but think how quickly he's going to crash out from the sugar crash.  Yeah, but if you want to go to bed and you forgot that you gave them some kind of sugary  thing, like, oh, it sucks.  You've got to really think that shit through if you're...  How long does it take for it to get in their blood?  Like, how long...  Seconds.  Yeah?  Seconds you see their whole personality change.  Yeah.  Wow.  All right, Pat Cooper's next.  Stay there.  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel on Sirius XM. 
[02:09:30]  I speak to Jesse.  Yeah, this is him, sweetie.  Okay, would you please not call me sweetie either, sir?  Sorry, Toots.  Man, sir, would you please not talk to me like that?  I'm calling about your bill to the collections.  It's for a balance of $31.43.  How much was that again, Pumpkin Lips?  $31.43.  What is it for, though?  I don't know.  I didn't order it. 
[02:10:00]  I'm not sure what it is either, but a cup.  Please don't talk to me like that, sir.  I don't know what it is, though.  I would just pay the bill and get it over with.  It's only $31.43.  That's still a lot of money if you think about it, sweet cheeks.  Hello?  I asked you, sir, not to talk to me like that.  Like what?  With those sweet cheeks and all that stuff.  I don't go for that.  No problem.  Call the cakes. 
[02:10:30]  Hold on.  Yeah, SFPs.  I might do like a thing called Igloo Melton.  We rock so hard, we melt Igloos.  So hard, we're like a bunch of big rocks.  Igloo Melton, Igloo Melton, Igloo Melton, Igloo Melton, Igloo Melton, we're the sick fucker puppets. 
[02:11:00]  We rock so heavy only, the devil can lift it.  Sirius XM.  This is the O.P. Anthony Show.  All right.  I just slammed a cup of coffee.  I ate some sugar.  Because, I mean, you know, our energy is a little low today, but it's okay.  It's all right.  But today is the worst day to have our low energy because Pat Cooper is outside that studio door. 
[02:11:30]  And just going from the bathroom back to the studio, I talked to him for two minutes.  I'm exhausted.  How does he have more energy than anybody else?  I don't know.  Maybe I should have a Pop-Tart.  You want a Pop-Tart?  Got a Pop-Tart out there?  Yeah, one of them cinnamon kind of ones there.  Are you going to have both?  Yeah.  Oh, you are?  All right.  Then give me two as well.  I'm having both.  Yeah.  All right.  That means you have to get four of them cooked immediately.  Look at him.  Pat Cooper's talking to the wall.  Look at him. 
[02:12:00]  Wait.  Keep the door open.  Keep the door open.  Listen to me.  He always has something going on.  Yeah.  Listen.  See, but I know my weaknesses and my...  Is there a door open?  Yep, there it is.  What, they got their own buttons?  Yeah.  You should see him take it in.  Oh.  Ah, Mr. Cooper.  He's bowing down.  Mr. Cooper.  How are you, son?  You're doing a great job.  Thank you.  Yeah, young Samuel.  Not Cooper.  How are you, sit there, there, any way you want, sir.  Anthony, what does it mean, Anthony?  Anywhere you want, sir.  What is my year up, Anthony? 
[02:12:30]  Anywhere you want.  Like I do go to Anthony.  Nah.  I don't need this.  With the utmost respect, sir.  What seat you want?  What seat you want?  He goes, I'm bullshit.  I'm sick and tired of this night because I don't need this.  I'm an icon.  You are an icon.  If you talk about you and you're dead, then you talk to me.  They're talking about me now and I ain't die yet.  Yeah, you're still alive.  Wait, it's been a year since you've been here.  You're looking good.  Look at you.  It's been a year since you've been here.  Why are we here?  Yeah, pull that fucking fishing pole out of the way.  Jesus Christ.  All right, what's the story? 
[02:13:00]  Are we on the air?  We are on the air, Pat Cooper.  You're on the air.  I want to say good morning, gentlemen, and it's a pleasure to be on this show.  Absolutely.  And let's see, this is what, 2012?  Yeah, that's what they say.  So can I book the 13th already?  Yeah, let's do it.  Because I know you don't have the exposure of the great ones.  You keep flipping in these young kids and I haven't heard from them since.  No, huh?  No.  I was turned down on every festival except the Ethiopian one.  And I was telling the gentleman outside, I said, you know. 
[02:13:30]  Gentleman.  Who's the gentleman?  Not even the New York festival.  Not even the New York festival.  We'd like you in the festival.  And I keep checking the morticians, you know.  I said, did I die?  You know, and then I have guys like, you know, Hank, it's got a friend.  And I go, Jesus Christ.  What's the guy that used to be on stand?  They, uh, where is he?  Uh, which one?  Come on.  Try to commit suicide.  Oh, Artie.  Oh, Artie.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Artie, a wonderful man.  But not funny.  And no disrespect to him.  No disrespect.  No, I tell you right now. 
[02:14:00]  That's a lot of disrespect, right?  And I don't hate the guy.  Yeah.  But why are you up there?  There's 3,000 people come to see you, and nothing's happening.  And I'm saying, how can you have the balls to go up in front of an army?  You don't like Artie?  You don't have the weapon.  I've seen.  Not only him, anybody.  Because if you get on a stage, and you're not prepared, get the fuck out of my business,  because this is a war.  I've seen Artie live.  The audience seems to like him.  Well, because you have no sense of timing.  Oh.  That must be it.  It's the hell you want from me. 
[02:14:30]  God damn it.  Let me tell you something, Anthony.  When you turn around doing this five days a week, I don't fucking have a sense of anything.  You become fucking like, you know, you become like Lord.  Remember Lord?  You've got, you make sense.  That's a good point there.  That doesn't make sense, because you're tired of this shit.  I'm just tired.  Because you're back to check every week, and it's killing your talent, whatever I have.  And I love you, and I respect you, but I'm telling you.  I hear that.  Let me tell you something.  You're a morning guy.  You're breakfast.  Yeah.  That's it.  After breakfast, sleep. 
[02:15:00]  That's it.  Well, that's what we do.  But what are you going to do?  It's true.  You survived.  At least he has children.  When the fuck do you have a kid last?  Well, you might have a kid out there.  Last weekend.  Tell me.  No.  Maybe.  Adopt me.  I got a job.  He might have kids out there.  You never know.  I'm too selfish.  I like winging out to Vegas and, you know, going wherever the hell I want to go.  I don't need to worry about kids.  You're in a fucking prison.  You want the truth?  What?  All you need is a warden.  Yeah.  You're in a prison here. 
[02:15:30]  This is not a job.  This is like, you know, all right, so I get up, six o'clock, the show starts.  I get up.  It's a check.  Bop, ba-da-bop, ba-da-bop.  You don't even enjoy farting.  I might as well be making license plates.  No, I'm serious.  This is not fun.  This is not life.  This is a fucking prison.  This is like going down for the third time.  It beats pouring cement.  Come on.  Why don't you go to Montana and bring in the herd?  Have you heard that?  Have you heard?  I got it.  I tell these kids, you get $2 million for two years, no taxes, go to Montana and bring 
[02:16:00]  in the herd because there's a shortage of cowboys.  Then I say to the kids, have you heard that?  And you don't know what the hell I'm saying.  I said, no humor out there.  No fucking humor.  It's just a humor.  No sense of humor.  I'd rather be in here every morning, though, than out at a job site, you know, doing construction  because that's a real job right there.  You're losing your personality.  I used to like it when you smiled.  I see that you had a certain charm, but even this is fucking boring. 
[02:16:30]  Well, I'm just getting fucking, you know, I'm tired.  It's the morning.  I do get tired.  There's nothing wrong with you.  It's just your place on earth.  Why don't we invite him into a soldier like this?  He's up at the Montreal Festival.  I would rather go to Germany if Hitler's still around.  Norton just left and he's bummed you.  Well, he's got to go somewhere.  You know, he's a comedian.  Yeah, yeah.  He goes there and it's good.  I like him.  Send my regards, you know, and tell him I said I asked for him. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, he just left.  He wanted to hang out and see you.  Well, he's not hanging out.  We don't hang.  I don't hang with nobody because they get familiar.  Yeah.  And that could be a problem.  What do you do, gather?  Nah.  What do you do?  You gather with people?  I don't gather.  No.  I'm a loner.  Oh, you're a loner.  We go to dinner after the dinner.  Let's not socialize.  Just swallow and let's get the fuck home.  Jesus.  Oh, the fool.  Everything is an epic.  It's a fucking epic.  Yeah.  You know, you go into a restaurant.  It's an epic.  They become your brother.  They kiss and fucking hug you. 
[02:17:30]  And I don't like that.  I said, I'm not.  You got to work for me.  I sit down.  You serve me.  What are you kissing me?  What are you getting personal?  How you been?  It's been a long time.  Because I wasn't hungry.  They love you, Pat.  It's not.  No, that's bullshit.  I know love.  I know love.  Yeah, what's love?  I know love when they say, Mr. Cooper, nice to see you.  Yeah.  And I say, well, okay, I'm a customer now.  But when they go, hey, Pat, how's your brush?  How's my brush?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What are you alone? 
[02:18:00]  No, I got a fucking army behind me.  No, you want a table.  No, I'd like to sit in the toilet.  I mean, what the fuck is all this ad lib?  You know why?  Because they know the word is out.  On the computer, tip her.  I'm at the top of the fucking list.  Yeah.  So what I do is, only man in show business, I get my after dinner drink before dinner.  Yeah.  I swear to you.  Well, why would you do that?  I walk in, I say, you want me as a customer?  I want my after dinner drink now.  So they go, don't you want an appetizer?  Why would I want an appetizer if I'm fucking hungry? 
[02:18:30]  Give me the turkey.  I need something to get to the fucking turkey.  Are you sick?  And they go, well, calm down.  And listen, we got some nice macaroni.  Do you have any bad macaroni?  Why do you have to drink first?  Yeah.  Why do you have to drink first?  Always a glass of wine.  Oh, yeah.  You know, I'm hoping that I'm poisoned.  I don't want to get the fuck out of here.  It's a bullshit, but you've got to realize this society today, I mean, people need money,  and I understand that, and things are tight, and things, and I'm saying, where were you 
[02:19:00]  when I made a few dollars, and I'm stupid?  Why does my daughter makes $40,000 a fucking year?  I made that last night, and I got no education.  So here's what I've been doing when I get invited to a wedding.  I give the groom a plunging, because this fucking bum makes about $56,000 a year.  I said, at least a plumber, you'll make $200,000, and you plumb.  And they look at me like I'm fucking nuts.  They said, well, I don't understand it. 
[02:19:30]  Very simple.  Don't give me the shit four-ply toilet tissue.  Give me a fucking rag.  But this is what I never lived that way.  You want two-ply, three-ply?  My ass just wants to be taken care of.  If you have a reply, give me one of those.  You think people are spoiled these days?  I don't know.  You know, it's over.  I've been dead for so many fucking years.  It's over.  You know, I'm going to be 83 on Tuesday, and it's okay.  Tuesday.  I made it. 
[02:20:00]  That's amazing.  I made it, and I had a great life.  You're still here?  Come on.  Huh?  You're still here.  Don't make it sound.  Tony, you're talking to a human being.  You're not talking to, you know, some of these kids that go, you know, hey, wow, hey,  wow, because they're in show business.  Yeah.  I was in show business where you had to wear makeup.  Then you knew you were in fucking show business.  If you didn't have makeup on, you know, remember Mantan?  Mantan.  Well, see?  See?  Oh, what the hell is that?  It used to be in a tube, and you rub.  It looked like a sun, you know, like a sunburn.  Sure. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah.  But boy, it corroded your face.  Did it?  Yeah.  People say, jeez, you got no wrinkles, they say to me.  I says, who wants wrinkles?  If I pull my pants down, I'll show you wrinkles.  Because at 83, you know, I'm not bad.  Call it 83.  Not bad.  And they want to know who's my lady.  I says, nothing.  Dead.  Nothing.  Fuck.  And you see this, sis?  This is dead.  That's your penis?  It's over.  But you got to turn around and say, mother of God, I can pee.  We take peeing for granted.  Peeing at my age now is better than sex. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because when you finish, you go, oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, mother of God, that was great.  When you had a broad, you went, oh, gee, she's great.  Oh, I never felt like that.  Wasn't that, Sylvie?  It's that way you go.  I'm going to pee.  I get off peeing.  Do you remember the last time you had a woman?  A big, nice, stiff one?  The last time you had a woman.  You know, a big, stiff one.  The last time as I made a tree, I think I was 60.  Whoa.  Oh, come on.  Come on.  He's lying.  Well, when you say a woman, my wife died, so that was the end of it.  I'm a straight guy.  Well, you could get another girl after the morning period. 
[02:21:30]  Get a little chippy for yourself.  When a man tells you the truth, you say, Pat, how are you?  I said, honey, look, I'll just, I know this reason back, and I love you.  I'm 80, I'm going to be 83, and I have no desire.  I'm dead, so let's go and eat.  I'll take you to dinner, and then she goes, don't you want to sleep with me?  If I sleep with you, I'm sleeping.  And they don't believe it.  And I had a girl turn around and try to jump me, and I said, honey,  it's two out of three falls, you won. 
[02:22:00]  Because it doesn't, it's honest.  My body can't take it.  Yeah.  I take a nap at 2 o'clock, 3 o'clock, I get up, I go to bed.  That's when you know you're fucking old.  But you guys are young, you got spark, you see a little pussy there, oh my God.  Oh, I'm still, it's a fucking joke.  Yeah.  Listen, women now are more interested in their dog.  Yeah.  And that's what's going on, that's right.  And here's what they say to you when you hit on them. 
[02:22:30]  You want to open my envelope, you better have enough stamps.  Oh boy, what the hell is that?  This is like a business.  Yeah.  And they say, well, there's no prostitution going on, there's no who is going on.  What do you call that?  What do you call that?  I got to open your fucking envelope, it's a fucking business.  So naturally, your pecker goes down.  There's no juice there.  They say, you got a short of a testosterone.  What the fuck is testosterone?  It means my body's dead.  And they keep sending me things when I do radio shows. 
[02:23:00]  And Mr. Cooper, you're having trouble having an erection.  I says, I used to have trouble.  No, I don't.  Why?  It died.  You can't bring back the fucking dead, I said.  And I don't need your pills.  I don't need none of that because I don't want to do it.  Just no interest.  Wow.  No interest.  How can there be interest if your life at my age is to survive?  That's all.  What are you thinking about now?  You're thinking about the will, giving your family the money.  Oh, my God.  And saying, no, that's very important. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah, I know.  But it's like, hey, there should still be something, a little spark there for something.  Yeah, this is it.  This is it, huh?  After this, it's back to downhill.  Because that is honesty.  Yeah.  No disrespect to you two guys.  No, no, you're being very honest, but it seems like they're shipping.  But to you, it don't mean shit, to be honest.  You've got no time for honesty.  You've got your fucking life.  You know, bop-a-dee-bop-a-dee-bop-a-dee-bop, and tomorrow it's bop-a-dee-bop-a-dee-bop-a-dee-bop.  Sure, yeah, yeah.  But that's good.  That's good because it works for you.  Yeah. 
[02:24:00]  You see?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  But, you know, you're still a semi-name.  Let's not get fucking gracious.  Well, please, semi.  Semi.  We'll take that.  We'll take semi.  You're fucking on your way.  Yeah, I'm on my way, all right.  We've been on our way for 18 years to retirement.  You know, now it's serious.  It's time for us to get the hint.  And it's fucking boring.  Yeah.  It's fucking...  I'm surprised you're not going to get on a show to be a judge.  Oh, please.  Enough of that.  Huh?  I don't want to mention names, but there's a certain judge out there that has no fucking talent. 
[02:24:30]  So how can you judge talent?  When you're a fucking bully, how the fuck can you judge talent?  Now, if you want to know who I'm talking about, that'll be $9.  This is what bothers me.  You don't like that?  And you've got J-Lo, who's got a young stud.  Yeah.  So which means at 83, if I'm going out with a girl, say, 85, I'm her stud.  Right.  Right?  That's good.  But I still can't get a heart, so what the fuck good is it?  That's good.  But we always have categories.  You know, then the other guy, what's the guy with that big group? 
[02:25:00]  He wants to...  He's always smiling.  What's his name?  He quit, too.  God.  What big group?  He was with the big group.  Airplaner or something.  Oh, Aerosmith.  Huh?  Steven Tyler.  Yes.  He just quit the show.  Steven Tyler.  I mean, J-Lo.  Steven Tyler.  Steven Tyler.  It is Steven Tyler, right.  But you see that smile?  It's like a cheese grater.  I'm saying, where do we got me?  God bless.  He's a musician.  Why the fuck is he on a game thing like that?  Yeah, yeah.  You've got to have people that that's what they do.  But when you see J-Lo stepping out, you know something? 
[02:25:30]  She's starting, you know, a little over 40.  She's got a couple of twins.  And, you know, what the fuck are they?  Where are they going?  Where are they going?  So now the stud's telling her, let's get married.  When she's finished with that dick, it's fucking over, son.  She'll burn more dicks out than if you had a fucking match.  But that's it.  That's what it's all about today.  Yeah.  So I went through that when I was a kid.  It's over.  And you turn around, you say, thank God, I did everything I ever wanted to do.  Yeah. 
[02:26:00]  But now you still enjoy performing.  That you must...  I'm going to the 18th of August.  I'm going to be at the Count Basie Theater.  And Robert Klein and I are working together.  I got about eight, nine jobs.  And it's not ego.  I don't give a fuck if another job don't come in because that's not what I'm about anymore.  I mean, years ago, you were climbing a mountain.  There's no more fucking...  I'm looking to climb a rock because it's over.  My pleasure now is hoping somebody's got a yard to sit down and just say, you want a beer? 
[02:26:30]  I said, no, I just want to sit here.  I went to the suburb the other night.  I got scared.  A woman says, mister, yes, don't sit on those wooden chairs.  I said, why?  She goes, there's bedbugs there.  What?  Bedbugs?  She goes, yeah, that's where they hide out.  Who the fuck's got time?  I'm in the subway to worry about who's fucking hiding out.  She goes, well, I only meant to be nice.  You're wonderful.  Bedbugs in the fucking...  In this subway?  Are you fucking nuts?  And you know, something got on a train and they had these little things here on paper. 
[02:27:00]  We take care of bedbugs.  I said, what a fucking way I'm going to a restaurant.  And I got to read this shit.  You got to read about bedbugs.  Oh my God, I got to the restaurant.  It was closed.  I said, maybe they got hit with fucking bedbugs.  Closed.  I cannot believe it.  I went to Coney Island.  I haven't seen it in years.  I wanted to cry because I remember...  Oh, oh boy.  I remember the nickel hot dog.  I said, what a fucking...  Who had the pleasure that I had to live at Coney Island? 
[02:27:30]  Now, the other guy who's full of shit is now, you know, he's down in the Hamptons.  The Hamptons.  You where you going?  To the Hamptons.  What are you going to do?  Hamptons.  So you build a $50 million house and the fucking world is trying to tell you, we're going to drown you in a couple of years.  Go back a couple of miles.  But no, they think they're not the bully no more.  And you know something?  When you're born a dog, you can't die a cat.  Aw, shit.  I love that one.  Write that one down.  Remember that, my buddy. 
[02:28:00]  You may not have me on too often.  I'm tweeting that shit.  When I'm on once, it's a fucking epic.  I'm tweeting that shit.  I love being here and I thank you.  You know that.  Oh, please.  August 18th, Pat Cooper at the Count Basie Theater in Red Bank, New Jersey.  I just said that.  I'm not going to be there twice.  Well, I'm going to keep promoting it for you.  I'm going to be in Purchase in September.  What's Purchase?  Purchase.  Susan Essman.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm doing a couple of jobs.  She's a nice one.  September 13th.  September 13th.  You got everything.  Purchase, New York. 
[02:28:30]  Performing Arts Center at Purchase College, September 13th.  Pat Cooper and Essman.  You're going to work.  You keep this up.  You'll be my hero.  What, to keep promoting?  You're so fucking good when you do sex.  I'm going to try to promote.  What the fuck else do you do?  I don't do shit.  He reads what you're going to hear about your career.  That's me.  Make it free four or five million a week.  A week.  Sure.  Well, sure.  That's what I'm going to hear.  Whatever it is, you got a job.  This kid next to me, I don't know what the fuck he does.  Oh, my God.  He's waiting for a train.  He's got like eight radio shows here on SiriusXM.  You got good people here.  And he doesn't make any money.  No, he doesn't make any money, Pat Cooper. 
[02:29:00]  They don't pay him.  Why?  Oh, he's an intern?  Well, he's...  You're an intern?  No, he's actually an employee, but...  Listen to me.  You're out of your fucking mind.  You've got to get paid.  Because after your internship, you're fucking old.  You trust me.  You threaten these two guys.  Say, I want a thou at least a week just for fucking tips.  But they can't...  They say, well, we can't do it.  It's our corporation.  Bullshit.  Coming in next time with a fucking bow and arrow.  No guns.  No guns. 
[02:29:30]  No guns.  Don't fuck with guns.  Come over there with a water pistol that's got macaroni sauce in it.  Otherwise...  But you've got to get paid.  I said that to the other guy.  I don't want to mention names.  The bully, I said, why don't you pay these kids?  Give them lunch fucking money.  You've got $80 million in a fucking bank.  What are you going to do with the money?  He didn't know.  He didn't have no fucking answer.  And he married again.  God bless him.  And the woman, who's a nice lady, and she lives with him and another dog.  And the dog died.  So the dog made the papers. 
[02:30:00]  I'm a fucking genius.  And I can't get a fucking item on toilet paper.  And this fucking guy's dog dies, who's no fucking talent.  And the goddamn thing goes, so-and-so's horse, and the wife is in a tremor.  She don't even know what a fucking tremor is.  She couldn't spell the fucking word.  Who the fuck is this guy?  He's the only Jew I know.  His nose was born on a Thursday.  His body attacked Friday.  And he's a fucking bully.  And he's out there now saying, I never did that.  Oh, really? 
[02:30:30]  A man, and you're talking to one, says what he did wrong.  You can't cop a plane.  Did you do that?  Yes.  When I stole a dollar from my mother's pocketbook, she goes, I won't hurt you.  Just tell me if you did that.  I did that.  And that was the fucking end of that.  And I never did it again.  That's how it used to work.  Because you don't do that if you want to start to steal and hurt people's fucking feelings.  Today, they don't steal a dollar. 
[02:31:00]  They take your whole fucking house.  They turn around and they call it Ponzi.  The last time I heard the word Ponzi was years ago.  Nicky Ponzi.  They gave him four years.  Now the word Ponzi is a big fucking word.  Yeah.  What happens if it's a Ponzi thing?  And he loves to get a nice tie, your honor.  I swear on my grandkids, I didn't mean it.  You know, when these things happen, 17 fucking million?  This is the guy you want to make president.  He knows how to raise money.  That's the guy that knows how to get money.  Right.  Nah, you know, they'll let this guy mad off. 
[02:31:30]  He'll get off in a couple of years.  Look at the broad.  The president, Clinton, said, what?  He says, can you free my husband?  He's a rat bastard son of a bitch.  Piece of shit.  Yes, Mr. President, help me.  You're okay.  He's free.  She gives up her citizenship.  This fucking bitch gives up her citizenship.  How the fuck?  Go to Devil's Island, you sick bastard.  You give up America?  You give up America?  What the other guy?  What is it, Apple or Tangerine, whatever these companies are?  He turned around about 90 billion, and he's going to move to some other country. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah.  You ought to go to Devil's Island.  What the hell is wrong with the people?  I'm in America.  I'm meant to fucking die.  I gave me a good living.  Ups and downs.  I was great.  Met some nice people.  And that's what life is about.  Yeah.  You tell me, you have four ply.  Four ply?  Four ply.  That's what...  I like four ply.  Some people like wiping their ass with a...  Nice and soft.  Nice.  Like a duvet.  Nice.  This is where people are.  Yeah.  Do you have any bottled water?  No.  There's a thing called sink. 
[02:32:30]  A fucking sink.  Do you know what a sink is?  What's a sink?  It's a thing you're playing, and fucking water comes out.  Yeah, but you know, there's a lot of stuff in the water.  Yeah.  If you're in the fucking ocean, there's fish.  But you're not in the ocean.  It's a fucking sink.  If a fish comes out, you're a fucking genius.  You'll be turning around opening up your own fish market.  You understand?  I understand.  I still drink sink water from time to time.  Well, because I came from the bedroom in the fucking hallway.  And if the bedroom is on the floor that you lived on, it was a dollar more. 
[02:33:00]  Really?  And I say, Dad, we're on the third floor.  You go to the bedroom on the fourth floor.  In the middle of the night, he goes, no, pee out the window.  And we did that for years.  And to watch your mother sitting her ass out the window, because we didn't want to walk upstairs.  And the tomatoes came out great.  You know what I'm saying?  And now that's called out.  That's disgusting.  Oh, really?  Without old people, you dickhead, there's no young people.  So those people who had their ass out the window made what this country is about. 
[02:33:30]  Now nobody wants to show their ass out the window.  Well, we don't need windows no more.  We have air conditioning.  What's that?  You press a button, and it takes the sweat off your balls.  There it is.  But why?  I don't know.  You're supposed to sweat, you asshole.  I said, Dad, I'm sweating.  He goes, well, go in the yard.  That's why we don't have a yard.  Well, go any fucking way.  You got to sweat.  If you don't sweat, you'll fucking die.  Make sure you get money.  Don't you think I forgot you, son? 
[02:34:00]  Thank you.  Don't thank me.  There's going to be a fucking riot outside here.  Pat.  When I walk with a sign, you'll probably get two, three thousand.  You'll fire these two guys.  Pat, why are you dressed like a mechanic today?  No.  I was waiting because that's your limit.  No, no, no.  I was waiting for you to say something, so I dressed like this like Joe and Adlib.  That's his fucking Adlib for the fucking years.  This is called, and let me stand up, it's called.  It's a jumpsuit.  You're saying nice.  All the air goes around your balls, around your head.  All the air. 
[02:34:30]  When you take your shorts off, you drain it.  It's terrific.  I got about eight or nine of them.  When I go to Florida, don't ever do that when I'm talking.  Oh, man.  Just a mic.  Don't adjust his mic.  You got permission to backhand him.  This is the future.  This is the future.  Nobody wants to wear suits or jackets.  This is nice.  It's coveralls.  It's coveralls.  You're right.  I change for another one.  I got a pink one when I walk in certain neighborhoods.  As long as it doesn't have a hatch in the back.  I tell you, I don't like to dress with the suits and shit anymore. 
[02:35:00]  And at my age, I get away with it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, when you're this age, you get away with it a lot because it's not like I'm not going  to be handsome for anybody.  I'm just looking to say, you know, I know I got a bad, oh, the hearing, I got the problem.  And this is another thing.  And I'm not making this up.  All over the television, we have a hearing aid now that you can't see.  Right.  I said, how about fucking hearing?  I've been 50, almost 50,000 in hearing aids.  I said, years ago in the 18th century, they had a pipe hanging out of your fucking ear. 
[02:35:30]  But you heard.  Now you got a hearing aid you can't see.  And now you can't hear.  They don't work?  Now you ought to go to fucking jail.  Oh, man.  It's so full of shit.  I got hearing aids.  I got hearing aids in my drawer.  If you want to talk to me, talk to the fucking drawer.  That's how bad it is.  That bad?  Oh, man.  They say, read lips.  I said, excuse me, sir.  Where's the cab?  I don't know.  I don't live around here.  What?  I don't know.  I don't live around here.  They don't want fucking lips to people. 
[02:36:00]  You're asking ventriloquists.  Is this too heavy for you?  No, I think I'm...  No, we're following.  I think I'm getting it.  This will last you a fucking year.  I'm getting it.  When I'm on this show, you don't need me twice a year.  Once is in a...  Next year, God, we're alive.  I'll come halfway.  I know you're going to be around next year.  Come on.  I don't want to be around next year because this is not my future here.  I'm trying to just keep this thing on.  You know, people send me some of your tapes.  I can't even hear the fucking tapes.  Yeah, really?  With respect to you, when they send me the other guy's tapes, I hear music. 
[02:36:30]  Because the other guy, it's a C.  This is why young people today, this gentleman on my right,  Sam, want to learn and everything.  How can you learn from a guy that doesn't have a heart?  I got a question.  What happened with you and the other guy?  What?  What happened with you and the other guy?  You guys used to get along.  I knew from day one that this show was good for me 
[02:37:00]  because I wanted to be on everything, okay?  I had a problem.  And now, Kanye, when I wanted to be on this show,  it took a little time, and I'm not angry at that.  And, you know, that's show business.  I wanted to be on.  But I didn't want to be like, he's my fucking leader because I can't handle that.  I'm not a fist fighter.  I'm not a fist fighter.  I'm not a, I know when to back off.  But then we started, you know, putting my stuff in, my smoke from the top of my head.  And I used to say off the camera, he is a fucking bully. 
[02:37:30]  The man is a bully.  He bullies people.  And then God love him.  He's 90 million, 100 million.  This is not the time to tell your children, you know, I'm sorry I'm that way.  Fuck you, kids.  Huh, you went to private school?  You got a car?  You got your own fucking room?  How about thank you, Daddy?  I'm sick of this shit.  Pat Cooper's had kids.  You fuck what him, he tells his kids?  You're out of fucking order.  You don't like it?  Don't call me Daddy.  Call me Hey, You.  Oh, those are your kids?  You can't do that.  Fuck you again.  How's that grab your ass?  Wow.  But no, they don't. 
[02:38:00]  They don't because the guilt.  See, Italians don't have guilt.  No.  They don't give a fuck.  My father says, why don't you die?  So we can take you and put you on a corner somewhere and pray to God you got a fucking job.  That's what the story is.  Job.  Go to fucking work.  I made $6.  He gave me a dollar.  Where's the other five?  There's a thing called rent.  I'm 12 years old.  I got to pay fucking rent.  That's it.  Learn how to take care of yourself. 
[02:38:30]  Today, what?  $12?  They don't want to look at $12.  They want to see the hundred.  Because it's us.  That put that situation there.  I don't want my kids to go through what I went through.  I miss sitting on a stoop.  I miss turning around and playing stickball.  No one.  I want to go on the fire escape.  I want to turn around and walk on a corner and do Al Jolson.  Nobody knows who Al Jolson is. 
[02:39:00]  We know Al.  You understand?  Yeah.  But.  Nobody wants to work for it now.  Work?  They want to be at the top right away.  It's not in their vocabulary.  Yeah.  You see.  I got, I tell you, I got my family.  They're nice.  They're nice.  I got a place in Florida for them.  You got a Cadillac downstairs for them.  Oh.  Come.  Vacation.  You got Disney World.  You got the fucking ocean.  You got the, you got the, uh, uh, all the way to the tip of Florida where you can see 
[02:39:30]  the Cubans and you can wave at the fucking Cubans.  Now on your vacation, you go to Cancun?  Well, I want to swim with the dolphins.  We got the Miami dolphins.  What the fuck you want to swim with the fucking dolphins?  Are you fucking sick?  My father brought a porgy home.  You think I'm going to sit in a fucking tub with the porgy?  This is what's sick.  Leave the dolphins alone.  You're a fucking evil person.  The fish don't want to deal with you.  They're fucking fish.  Do you notice lately?  The big mother jumping sharks are coming in areas where they don't supposed to be because 
[02:40:00]  they're telling you, you're fucking in my water, mama.  You think, yeah?  We're going to get your ass.  This is fucking war.  If the fish go to war, they're closing down the fucking oceans.  You don't go in other people's houses.  The fish don't come to my house.  I don't go in the fucking ocean.  It's as simple as that.  It's not about fish.  No, I'm not being, you know, this is all education.  I hear you.  And this is why he hates the other guy.  Yeah, sure.  That's another thing.  Everybody's walking around with these fucking things. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  I got tinnitus.  What?  You know, tinnitus.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And it's terrible.  But I overcame it.  Thank God I can sleep.  But every once in a while, I'm walking down the street.  I hear, is that you, Mac?  Oh, that's pretty bad tinnitus.  Is that you, Mac?  No, I think there's somebody behind me saying, is that you, Mac?  And I turned around, I said to the woman, excuse me.  She goes, excuse me.  What is your problem?  And I said, well, then I realized the fucking, you know, the tinnitus.  And you're deaf.  So, and here I'm still doing radio.  Oh, man. 
[02:41:00]  And I don't remember what I'm saying.  I don't even fucking hear me.  I know.  But you bring me on because, I mean, who's going to come here on a Thursday morning,  nine o'clock?  You don't put me on seven, eight, where all the fucking fans are listening.  You tape me.  And then I go to Mongolia with the fucking tape.  But the kids, when I walk the street, maybe a week from now, they'll say, when you're going  back, I says, that was it.  Not going back.  They need me.  And if they play fucking games, I may go on a radio. 
[02:41:30]  Oh.  Then we'll have a problem.  Yeah, we will.  But that's the story.  Competition.  Anyway, but everything's okay.  That's all.  I'll get you about a few dollars.  Thank you.  You come here at six in the morning?  Five.  Did you have a big breakfast?  No.  You say you're getting dizzy spells already.  These guys will take care of you.  Just don't ask me.  We try.  We do try, right, Sam?  Let them know.  They try.  We do try.  Wow.  They try for me.  It's what?  They try for me.  They try?  That's what they say, yeah.  Well, that's what Howard used to do. 
[02:42:00]  He tried for everybody.  No, no.  Yeah, that's why I'm talking about him.  Yeah, yeah.  They don't call him anymore with his name.  They say, have you heard him?  Oh, really?  Did you see what?  Oh, a buddy of mine.  You're going to read that?  I was just going to give you a plug.  This is more bad.  Go, go, go, go, go.  A buddy of mine saw in America Has Talent.  Right.  My Otegad.  The Gonchow.  I got the permission to tell the story.  Okay.  My friend went on.  He's a ventriloquist.  And he got a standing ovation. 
[02:42:30]  He was marvelous.  And Howie Mandel says, you're going to be one of the biggest stars.  And I like Howie.  And, you know, and the other guy.  No, I'm right.  The other guy.  You know, he goes, yeah, it's just going to happen.  And then the one in the middle who I don't know what the fuck she does.  Her husband, Kato, he bites chicken's head.  So what the fuck?  She became a star.  I bite a pussy.  They don't want to put me in jail.  So anyway, Stacey said, you're going to Vegas.  You're going to Vegas. 
[02:43:00]  So he calls me a couple of days later.  I says, Jim, how are you?  I goes, Pat, you ain't going to believe it.  I went to Vegas.  And they had a room for me.  And I'm waiting and waiting.  They finally call me.  And I go to the studio.  He said, I got my props and everything.  He says, I waited almost 19 hours to go on.  They finally call me.  I walk out.  He says, there's no audience.  There's three judges.  I do what I did.  Two minutes, three minutes.  They told me, we won't need you.  Thank you. 
[02:43:30]  I said, that's when you should have said, fuck you.  And you take my dignity away.  I got to fly 3,000 miles.  And you treat me like shit.  What happened to him who said I'm a dynamo?  Because he don't know fucking talent anyway.  And the other one who likes people, you know, eat chicken heads.  And then Mandel is going, you want to make a deal?  The deal is over, Howie.  You got to do something else.  But these are great jobs for 20, 30 million a year.  Easy work.  Easy work to judge that shit.  But they think they got it coming because they honestly believe, that's me, baby. 
[02:44:00]  You got no fucking talent, you.  How dare you turn around and judge people?  How about we judge you?  You'd wind up in fucking Devil's Island.  Don't bullshit me.  And don't walk around with an attitude.  But his dog died.  Devil's Island.  His dog died.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So when they bury it, it's going to be his dog on the fucking big stone.  His dog died.  Because he don't want you to mention his name. 
[02:44:30]  Do you understand?  The dog should pee on him.  That's what the fucking dog should do.  And she's turning around, and I think she's wonderful, and she's very nice, and she likes dogs, and she helps dogs.  She's married to one.  So that's what she should turn around.  She's trying to help him.  She used to call him a puppy.  Now he's a fucking bull.  Well, she must have saw something in him.  There's nothing in him.  You understand?  What did she see in him then?  When they circumcised him, he lost a big toe. 
[02:45:00]  No, you know what it is?  What did she see in him then?  Money?  Look, there are wonderful women out there, and then there are ball breakers.  They would marry anybody.  Yeah.  All right?  Point.  Who's the guy at MGM?  Karkorian?  Yeah, sure.  All right?  He's 90?  Yes.  He's marrying a 50-year-old woman.  Jackie?  What's that?  I got no respect.  Mason.  Huh?  Jackie Mason.  No. 
[02:45:30]  I got no respect.  Rodney Dangerfield.  Yeah, you said Jackie, though.  Rodney Dangerfield.  His wife is going to marry Karkorian.  He's 93.  Really?  She's 50.  She was beautiful when I met her.  She's wonderful.  Beautiful.  But I'm bringing a point out.  I remember her.  There's no more, you know, I'm in love, I'm in love.  What do you got to show?  What are you looking at?  We're looking at pictures of her.  What, do you got a mouse here?  What is it?  But anyway, okay?  Yeah.  So there's no, I'm in love.  Right.  The word love is dangerous. 
[02:46:00]  What are you looking for?  Oh, man.  We're looking at the guy and the broad.  He's got it over there.  Right here.  Look.  Her?  Is that Karkorian?  Oh, yeah.  He looks good for 90, Pat.  Is that Karkorian?  I'm going to look at my voice.  He's in his 90.  She's gorgeous.  She's beautiful.  All right.  Look, I'm 83.  I say, honey, I'm too old for you, and I want to, you know, like, sometime I say,  and I'm old enough to be your grandfather.  In fact, I am your grandfather.  So, but look, he looks good for his 90s.  He looks good for 90, Pat.  He's worth 900 million. 
[02:46:30]  Jeez.  What did he do?  He could have anybody he wants.  What did he do?  I could not.  Ah, MGM or something.  I could not walk down the street because it's like walking down with your daughter,  me, or your grandkids.  Yeah.  But, jeez, look at it.  She's smiling.  Yeah.  What do you care what the people think, though?  He's got a face like a cheese grater.  What do you care what the people think?  Walk down the street.  He's got a young chippy on his arm.  What do you care what people think?  I tell you, he's got his own boat.  He's got his own life.  He's worth a couple of billion. 
[02:47:00]  And then she signs a prenup for maybe he gets 100 million.  Yeah.  He says, you know, you can't have it all.  And she goes, well, what were you speaking of, 100 million?  And that's it.  Man, that would be nice.  And then he has a special doctor that when they're ready for sex, he puts a scaffold  under his cock.  And then they push the thing.  And then his cock goes up.  Then they give him a needle.  And he goes to sleep.  When he wakes up, he says, how was I?  See, you were a killer.  The woman said, I never met a man like that.  And that's the story.  So it's bullshit.  That's bullshit.  You know, when they want to save you now in the ocean, you know, the life guy said, 
[02:47:30]  I was going to go in, but I didn't have the right bathing suit.  But, you know, it's that kind of shit.  It's all bullshit.  What are you reading?  Your novel?  I was going to read your plug.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm trying to sell you tickets here, Pat Cooper.  Count Basie Theater, Red Bank, New Jersey, August 18th.  And then September 13th at the Purchase College there with Susie Essman.  Doing a good job with that shit?  Yeah.  I'm talking to your guy.  That's my man.  How did the book do?  Oh, we remember him. 
[02:48:00]  And my book is going good.  I got no spot, you know.  How dare you say the holiday.  You know, it's good.  So we're doing all right.  Uh-oh.  What was this?  Oh, it's cookie time.  Did you put it in the, did you put it in the, you know, where the bread goes?  You want a pop tart?  No, thank you.  I think this is when your desk, this is why it had no color, when you eat that shit.  The fucking thing called eggs with bacon or ham.  I got color.  I look like a moulinier over here.  You don't eat pop tarts.  What are you going to do?  Cheers.  God bless you.  I mean, you're still living in the same neighborhood? 
[02:48:30]  I'll be God bless.  Is the other guy still there?  Who?  The guy in, uh, in, uh, uh, North.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Jimmy.  Is he married yet?  No.  He ain't get married.  No, no, no, no.  Not anytime soon.  He's single.  He's good.  He's smart.  Yeah.  And he's up in fucking Montreal.  Yep.  Are you in the neighborhood still?  Huh?  Are you in the neighborhood?  I haven't seen you in a while.  Well, you know, I got things to fucking do.  You don't think I'm going to wake outside my door waiting for you to walk by?  In fact, I don't want to say hello because you're not a celebrity to the fucking public. 
[02:49:00]  They never see you.  That's sad.  You're behind fucking closed doors.  That's really sad.  But you don't need a tan.  You need some at work.  But it's wonderful.  You got a good job.  You come to work.  That's it.  Yeah, you know.  Hey, you got a job.  No, no.  That's what they want to give you?  I'll take you to fucking breakfast.  Yeah.  Bullshit.  Sick bastard.  I'm giving him some of my food.  No, a pop tart.  He'll take you to breakfast.  We're sharing.  See, I share my food.  I'm a gentleman.  How can you give this to this poor kid? 
[02:49:30]  He loves it.  He's a kid.  He's on a fucking island and there's nothing there but a pop tart.  He'll eat your fucking balls.  He loves pop tarts and chicken fingers and little things.  He eats food like an eight-year-old.  That's the part of your life you go through that shit.  Then all of a sudden you wake up one day and you say,  Oh, that's food?  That's food?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's food?  Yep.  Now they're vegetarians.  And I always tell my grandkids,  You're vegetarians.  One day you're on a raft. 
[02:50:00]  You'll suck the oar.  And they go,  What is that?  Yeah.  Then my oldest granddaughter,  she's got her,  and her dress is very close to her ass.  I said,  Honey, why don't you walk backwards?  She says,  Why?  Well, evidently you don't like your face.  Oh, man.  Why are you showing your fucking ass?  Oh, boy.  And she goes,  Well, dad, pop.  I says,  Honey, I love you.  You're beautiful.  Why are you fucking...  What is that?  That's the public today.  For the guys.  You know how many asses I saw at that?  I didn't see nobody's face.  I said, 
[02:50:30]  Excuse me.  And I said,  That's what I heard.  Were they nice?  Nice asses?  Oh, again, you're not right.  I keep asking these questions,  not realizing...  I keep forgetting that,  like, you don't care.  You don't care about the women anymore,  as far as sex goes.  You've got to care,  because it's a good thing.  It's nice.  They give you great pleasure.  But then when the attitude comes in,  and men got attitude also.  Yeah.  But years ago,  there was no attitude.  My father got married  and made sure my mother was heavy, 
[02:51:00]  because we had no steam heat.  So when you jumped in bed,  my father hugged my mother,  and he goes,  How are you, cold?  And she goes,  No, I'm not too cold.  That's the heat.  Today, that's called perversion.  That was the heat back in the old days.  Yeah.  Just a nice fat woman next to you.  Because we had nothing,  and we made do.  And today,  they go,  Bullshit.  Well, Pat,  now I hear you have an iPhone now.  I hear you have an iPhone now.  Do you got one of these? 
[02:51:30]  One of these.  Listen to me.  Uh-huh.  One of these.  The fuck I got in my pocket,  and when it starts to tremble,  it's better than sex.  I don't even answer the fucking phone.  It's too complicated.  Is it?  Oh, what happened to,  Hello, how are you?  No, now you're going to push this,  put in your code.  Everything is ID.  My balls have got to be ID.  You go to the bedroom in Italy,  they say,  you have ID to pee?  Yeah.  Because you never know.  You never know.  What could happen, 
[02:52:00]  because wackos are out there.  That's all I got to say.  We know that.  You know, you go,  I mean, you come down here,  people make fun of this downstairs.  I said,  don't be fucking making fun of this.  I says,  you're dealing with poor shit today.  You need that.  You got to, you know,  because you got fucking people out there  and nuts.  What happened to that?  Well,  they're going to want to search me.  Who gives a shit?  You stop,  take your balls out,  put them back in the pocket.  When they okay your balls,  you get on the plane.  Otherwise,  go the fuck home.  That's another, 
[02:52:30]  I'm on.  That's another.  Don't fuck them there.  Now, Pat,  with the iPhone,  do you Twitter  or do you Facebook?  I don't know what it means.  No?  When you say Twitter,  that means I'm taking  the girl's brush.  I don't know I got a Twitter.  What am I sending out messages for?  Who the fuck wants to hear my message?  I don't know.  I think it'd be fun.  I love you, Anthony.  Happy bike.  Who gives a fuck?  I think it'd be fun.  I think you'd have a fun,  I think it'd be fun  to look at maybe a paragraph  from Pat Cooper every day.  You see what you have to say 
[02:53:00]  about just life in general?  Well,  there's nothing  that people are interested  in my attitude  because it's so fucking right  that it's boring.  Oh, is that?  It's so right.  It's so boring.  It's fucking boring.  That makes sense.  I don't lie to you.  I'm no genius,  but I think my common sense  frightens some of these talk shows.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean,  the Letterman's Delanos  and all these guys,  they won't put me on,  which is fine,  but the one that hurts  means David Steinberg.  He turns me down.  He don't know comedy.  So what does he do  interviewing his own friends? 
[02:53:30]  Who say the same fucking thing  over and over?  Don Rickles said,  she's a fine giants.  I love them all,  but he thinks he's part of that.  Don't want me on  because I got things to say,  David.  You're as funny as my crotch  because he does not  have a sense of humor.  He thinks because he can do  a little directing.  So they said,  right now,  we're not ready for Mr. Cooper,  but tell him thank you.  And I said to myself,  give me a reason  why I can't go on  your talk show.  And if you say, 
[02:54:00]  I'm not funny,  I'll punch your fucking face  in because you're a liar.  I'm fucking not only funny,  I'm probably the best  on the planet.  And if I didn't think that,  I wouldn't be as far  as I got.  You sick fuck.  What's the matter with you?  And your wife going,  I'm sorry,  we can't use you.  Who the fuck asked you?  Now I got the wife  and the fucking husband  jumping on my balls.  Then he goes,  and now ladies and gentlemen,  a giant in the business.  And he brings out one  which is,  you know,  Rickles and these kind of,  I love them beasts.  And he's going,  so the, 
[02:54:30]  and Don's,  you know,  and I go,  he said that two weeks ago.  Because in a love,  Rick,  they don't want to be interesting.  No.  With all due respect to Rickles  and all these guys,  they don't say nothing.  They're going to die  and they're going to say,  what about Don Rickles?  Oh,  I know Don,  the Mexican was in the front row.  The air glassing guy  was in the third row.  Okay.  What about Cooper?  Now we're talking genius. 
[02:55:00]  Why is he a genius?  He says 90 fucking shows a month  never repeated the same fucking story.  Really?  He says what's out there.  He's got reviews.  You may not agree,  but at least he's interesting.  It's not the same fucking book.  That's the fucking thing.  But we don't want him too often.  Why?  He'll eat up our fucking studio.  And we're afraid of him.  Yeah.  Because he'll eat up our fucking studio.  Oh,  so when you get threatened by him, 
[02:55:30]  I don't want him on my show no more.  Who the fuck asked you?  I think it's because you're exhausting, Pat.  Wow.  You're exhausting.  I insulted him?  No,  no,  you're an exhausting person to be around.  It takes a lot of energy.  Why don't they want me?  Why don't they want me on a show that I contribute?  If you don't like me personally,  then you wait for me to save you in the ocean?  Then I'm a nice guy when you fucking need me?  That's tough shit.  Then I back off.  Say,  I'd rather starve.  Fuck your show.  Because life is so fast, man. 
[02:56:00]  What the fuck you doing?  You're not hurting me.  You're hurting yourself.  Because the guy that I'm talking about is me.  There's nobody else but me.  Right.  That's not ego.  That's fucking fact.  And I've got news here.  Wow.  You got this documented.  The fucking day I die,  they'll be saying,  let's play this guy's stuff.  And let's,  you people out there,  there's nobody like him.  They won't say it today.  No,  no.  Because he may come in the studio and take over. 
[02:56:30]  He's not a takeover guy.  But that's what they'll say.  He's not a takeover guy.  No,  no,  no.  You're not a takeover guy.  I like my macaroni.  I dipped the bread and the sauce and I fought.  That's all.  He doesn't take over at all.  No,  no,  no,  not at all.  I agree with that.  Not at all.  We should tell you.  They don't want to hear the truth.  Can we take you to a strip club?  Nobody wants to hear the truth.  Because you've got people out there who say,  well,  he's on that show.  Yeah.  What do you put him on for?  It makes me nervous.  No,  because he's smart and you're a fucking dummy.  Don't tell me I make you nervous if I'm saying things that make sense. 
[02:57:00]  How does it make people nervous?  If I'm not saying things that make sense,  I'd never do these shows over the past 60 fucking years.  Why do you make people nervous?  Because of my energy scares them because you got people who don't do respect.  They're in their thirties and forties.  Youngsters are wonderful coming up.  They don't have the fucking energy.  When you're a comic,  you got to have a flow.  You got to have an energy.  You got to paint pictures with your mouth.  And people say,  Jesus Christ,  I can't really see what he just said.  That's painting pictures. 
[02:57:30]  Where the fuck are they today?  They're talking about,  I got with a girl and her pussy is at an angle.  And then when she pees,  that's not fucking funny.  That's not funny.  How about if somebody yells out to you,  are you talking about your mother's pussy?  Then he's going to go,  holy shit.  I mean,  if you're going to talk about something,  be careful what you put,  you walk into a trap.  There's a guy called Jim Johnson.  You ever hear him?  All right.  He talks about,  pardon me,  ladies,  about how shit is.  And then he says,  I want my girl.  And she,  I get her heart. 
[02:58:00]  And I,  she goes,  well,  that's going to be too big for me.  And then he says,  I told you to oil up your hole.  This is from Australia.  They had to come 30,000 miles to tell us this shit,  which is not funny,  but there are people out there and they go,  oh,  you know why?  Cause they're fucking dummies.  Why are you talking about shit?  Because if you tell a doctor,  he says,  how are you doing every day?  I communicate every day.  You see,  it'll lift to be a million years.  It's important.  Don't put shit down.  That's a disgrace that comes out of your body. 
[02:58:30]  That's wonderful.  But no,  this guy's making fucking fun.  But you're here to mate.  Hey mate.  Hey mate.  Hey mate.  I'm not a fucking mate.  Can't you say pot?  Hey mate,  you're doing good,  mate.  The fuck?  Once you launch a ship or something.  And I love the Australian people.  They're wonderful.  But I don't like that kind of comedy.  It's not funny.  No.  It's not right.  No,  it's bullshit.  But nobody would say,  well,  you're jealous cause he's,  he's making more money.  I'm jealous.  The fuck a man is not on my planet. 
[02:59:00]  Mate.  How's that fucking mate coming from a guinea?  You like my fucking mate?  When I say one more fucking mate,  I'll devour you.  But they're not on the planet.  I said to you,  I'm a Mr. Cooper,  asshole.  Right.  What have you done?  What have I done?  How about everything?  Oh,  how about everything?  Who's going to tell you what have you done?  Yeah.  Obviously.  That would be stupid.  You've done plenty over the years.  Everyone knows that.  And what over the years?  Everyone knows you've done plenty over the years. 
[02:59:30]  You're not looking for that.  No.  I'm looking for somebody to say,  you're not bad.  You do good.  Okay.  But like,  they can't come out of the fuck I'm off.  I said,  well,  what's your problem?  And you know,  and I say,  here's your problem.  You're not in my fucking league.  You're in the fucking minors.  You understand?  You're working clubs now  that when I was funny,  funny,  I worked bungalow colonies.  I worked with Jewish people.  I said,  if you're not funny,  get the fuck out of here.  And I know,  because the DNA of the Jewish culture is humor. 
[03:00:00]  And that's where I learned fucking flow  and orchestration of comedy.  These kids don't have orchestration of comedy.  It's motherfucker,  cocksucker,  motherfucker,  cocksucker.  It's cocksucker,  motherfucker,  motherfucker.  I said,  is that it?  What have you created?  Then they make a movie.  Then they make a fucking movie  and can't act.  Like who?  I'm saying,  I don't believe it.  But that's the society here.  And that's what it is.  Well,  these comics.  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  What movies,  though,  you think?  What movie do they make?  You?  What movie do they make? 
[03:00:30]  They make movies.  You said they make movies.  I made two,  maybe six in my life.  And I never went for movies.  You know why?  Right.  I was making big money.  I stand up.  I said,  what am I fucking nuts?  Guy said,  probably got $3,000.  You're going to be in Garmouth to win.  I said,  I got to do Garmouth to Breeze  and pick up $17,000.  The fuck are you kidding me?  Because I was a young kid  and it was sort of this kind of money.  Yeah.  So now that I'm in my 70s,  I did analyze this,  analyze that.  And everybody goes,  I didn't know you could do that.  Why didn't you fucking ask?  You see? 
[03:01:00]  So that's common sense.  Why do you ever got a big mouth?  Oh,  really?  Well,  go fuck around with David Steinberg.  Fuck around with him.  David Steinberg,  who don't know fucking talent  and insults my fucking ass  because I'm a fucking brilliant next to him.  Yeah.  In other words,  you're telling me  you were in the same ring with me?  You're not even in the fuck,  you can't even get in the garage with comedy.  And that's what pisses me off  when I got to listen to a guy  who's not even close to my humor.  And he's a disgrace  because I know you turn me down,  but when you turn me down, 
[03:01:30]  I'm coming after you  to let you know you're a dickhead.  You understand?  You are a dickhead.  Because I know Jewish comics,  you're a Jewish man,  but you're not close to that kind of humor  because you're not a natural.  So you're living off everybody else's sweat.  You think he's going to like me?  Probably not.  So that's it.  But nobody says that.  Why are you shitting of said that?  Why?  Why?  He's getting away with shit.  He's not that good  and I want the world to fucking know it. 
[03:02:00]  You turned down a genius?  I'm the guy with the fucking boat  and you're telling me  my boat's going to sink  and you're not even in it?  Pat, I forgot.  I forgot.  Who are you shitting on right now?  Who am I what?  Who are you shitting on right now?  David Steinberg.  David Steinberg.  That was it.  I just want to bring a point now  because I didn't have a chance  to get to this guy  to let him know  I'm pissed.  Right.  I'm going to be ashamed of himself.  Yeah, David Steinberg.  David Steinberg.  Well, I've been on bigger shows,  better shows.  I've done more than this guy 
[03:02:30]  and I'm saying,  well, you know,  I got feelings.  If you say right now,  maybe,  but to put a cold cock me like that.  Remember he had a show years ago  where he'd go,  ooga booga.  That was his little catchphrase.  Ooga booga.  Ooga booga.  Ooga booga.  I don't know what happened to him  and then he went away  and now he's back.  That's what is wrong  with our fucking world.  You got something to say to somebody,  say it to their face  and then you're a man.  They don't like a tough ship.  At least they know  where you're coming from.  I don't like you.  What do you mean?  I'll say it again  if you don't know what I mean. 
[03:03:00]  I don't like you.  Why don't you like me?  Because you're a dickhead.  You're a hopeless  fucking piece of shit.  But do you have to tell people that?  Yes, I must tell you, Anthony.  You're getting me pissed.  I came in happy  and I had depression in my balls.  I'm just thinking  maybe in some instances  it might be better  to just kind of lay low  and not tell them...  No, what anybody does  is called ass-kissing my ass.  I'll never kiss anybody.  Ass-kissing my ass.  That's right, Tony,  because I tell you that. 
[03:03:30]  Tony.  When a person pushes you,  you think you're supposed to take it  because he's a big star?  Fuck you.  Bravo, I like that.  All you are is sperm,  you dickhead.  That's all you are.  You come out of your father's cock.  But if you're a man,  if you're a man,  you are born.  Yeah, yeah.  There's a difference.  I got it.  Remember that when you get older.  In fact, you are getting older.  Sam's...  Sam, you are getting older.  Sam's getting a lesson  sitting here.  I tell you now.  You learned some bullshit.  Nobody on your fucking show 
[03:04:00]  and I love you  does what I do.  They ain't a fucking guy  and I've heard your show.  I don't hear.  I hear bullshit.  And you guys are nice  because you got to do it  12 hours a fucking day.  You become mummies here  and I understand.  I come here for the wake up.  I want to wake you up  because you're good guys.  You contribute.  The other guy, you know,  he's going on.  See, now if you get a game show,  you're on your fucking way.  We want...  That's it.  I would like that.  Yeah, we would judge a game show.  Nice in the afternoon.  Yeah, nice. 
[03:04:30]  You get up at 4 in the fucking morning.  You get in the studio at 11.  They make you up.  In Colorado.  Right?  12.30, you finish.  You go home.  You pick up a check for 20 million.  Yeah, that's nice.  Yeah, I like that.  And you say, you know,  and you say to people,  I'm very thankful.  You be humble.  It's very difficult  for you two guys to be humble  but you try.  We're pretty humble.  But it's good  and you got family.  You got children.  Yeah.  And it's wonderful.  But nobody's satisfied.  Yeah, yeah.  Nobody's satisfied.  My problem now is  I got to go to work August 18th.  I don't know  if I'm going to remember anything. 
[03:05:00]  Oh, no.  And my friend Steve Guerin  says,  Pat, you don't have to remember.  Just get up there.  But it's still a frightening thing.  But I got the boss  that said,  Jesus.  So they say,  bring a piece of paper up  like a lot of these people do.  He said,  you know,  you walk by  and I said,  I can't fucking read.  I got close caption  on my phone.  And I said,  look,  listen,  my close caption  on the phone,  do me a favor.  It takes about  a second and a half  for me to see  what the fuck you're saying. 
[03:05:30]  Right.  The guy said,  okay.  So Pat,  how you feeling?  How's your mother?  I just said,  what the fuck?  And all of a sudden,  the close caption  goes behind the steam pipe.  And I'm saying,  what the fuck?  How does that happen?  I got to read.  Now they say,  no texting.  I have no idea.  I'm very confused by that.  They say,  no texting.  Now on my new fucking phone,  I'm going to have  closed caption.  So not sure.  If I'm walking down the street,  I'm going to read my phone.  I'll go off a cliff.  Yeah.  Well,  you got to watch  where you're going.  You don't text?  It's in the brains.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So you pick up  on that shit like that.  You don't text though? 
[03:06:00]  You don't do the texting?  I don't know what it is.  I got a thing.  I just said to Steve Garrett,  my buddy,  I said,  Steve,  do me a favor.  Press something here  that works.  On the phone.  And he says,  I press this thing  with the flower.  Yeah.  And I thought  I'm going to see  a garden.  I see a highway.  I don't fuck a car  going back.  And I said,  Steve,  he goes,  Pat,  what are you touching  the flower for?  Because it's there.  That's the one  with the pictures.  Nah.  You don't have  any more commercials?  No.  We're riding you  right to 10. 
[03:06:30]  Count Basie Theater,  Pat Cooper.  You mean you're not  paid for the shit?  You get paid in plugs.  You get paid.  This is your pay.  This is your pay.  Remember,  when your kids say,  Daddy,  what was it like?  And you say,  Pat Cooper,  he'll know.  Yeah.  That's all you got to say.  Pat Cooper.  And you say,  no,  Dad,  wow.  Let me tell you  inside information.  And then you become a hit.  Yeah.  Is that easy as that?  Easy as that.  That's easy.  I wish we knew that  18 years ago. 
[03:07:00]  You know what it is?  It's not funny.  No.  It's a nervous breakdown.  Pat's just having  a nervous breakdown.  You people in Montreal,  you're lost again.  You're lost  a brilliant fucking comic.  They didn't invite you  to Montreal?  You showed yourself,  huh?  They didn't invite you  to Montreal?  They don't invite me  to my yard.  The fuck are you telling me?  Because you know what?  Throw these people.  They're not in with the young crowd  with the shit  and the cock and the piss.  Oh, right.  Pat Cooper says things  that mean things.  They don't want to hear that. 
[03:07:30]  It bothers them.  You might have to fire Steve.  Huh?  You might have to fire him.  Oh, man.  He might be the problem.  The man's wonderful.  He knows what he's doing.  Yeah.  Not because he's my friend.  He had a great business.  He's got great common sense.  And he told me last day,  Pat, get a pair of shoes.  How many guys would do that?  And I said, why?  He says, you're walking  like you're cockeyed.  And he mean,  because he cares about me.  And I says,  geez, that's nice.  And I said,  who cares about  your fucking shoes?  Right.  Then I found out  I was stepping on his wife's toe. 
[03:08:00]  You know,  that's another problem.  And so when you got a friend,  it's important  when you need somebody.  And you know,  it's just nice.  Did you get the shoes?  I'm going to go.  There's a sale.  He said,  all Jewish people  know about sales.  I said,  where?  He says,  on 79th Street.  It's called D&W something.  It's called,  I don't know,  leather on the hoof.  Something like that.  You know?  And anyway,  are we finished?  If you want to be.  Yeah,  we pretty much are.  Now I got to go to sleep.  I would say.  We all have to go to sleep now. 
[03:08:30]  We're all exhausted.  Pat Cooper.  First of all,  you know,  you know,  you're all the bullshit.  I care that you have me on.  I would love having you, Pat.  I mean it.  I mean it.  I don't want you to think.  But you got to help your audience  and say he was here  and they don't have to know  the name.  They know it's me  when you say he was here.  Oh,  they know it's Pat.  Oh,  they know it's Pat.  They know it's Pat Cooper.  Now what do you do?  Look at that smile.  You see that smile  he just gave us?  No,  it's live right now.  You don't take,  you mean you,  I'm going on from 9 to 10? 
[03:09:00]  Yeah.  This is for the,  this is,  how dare you?  No,  no,  no.  No,  I know what he's saying.  No.  Did you say I'm not going to,  this is not going to be heard no more?  No,  it's going to be heard  in the afternoon.  Don't look out Anthony.  Don't let him pull you in.  Hey,  hey,  it's going to be heard  three more times.  Okay,  you are kidding.  All right.  And then,  because this went so well,  we'll move it down  to a better time slot,  Pat.  Excuse me,  this man is married.  Yeah,  he is.  Oh yeah.  God bless you,  man.  Thank you.  How long have you been married?  A month and a half.  It's over. 
[03:09:30]  That's wonderful.  I think that,  you know something,  I think that's wonderful.  Oh,  it's a great wedding.  It's a tough thing  and you know that.  But you're going to be fun.  Tell your wife,  you know,  unfortunately she missed me.  What are you going to do?  But it's wonderful,  you know,  that we can do this  and we got a great country.  We got great people out there  and I just feel,  you know,  I get emotional  because I was doing  the Second World War  when this country was so,  no army,  no navy,  no nothing 
[03:10:00]  and we kicked ass.  Yes.  And we said,  wow.  I said,  my God,  where are you going to find  a country like this?  And we're going fucking nuts.  We're going nuts.  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  Now we're going to get it back together.  Right after this election,  we're going to get it back  and that's it.  Are you worried about America,  Pat Cooper?  Are you worried about America?  Why do I worry about America?  Are you worried?  I,  well,  did you see the papers  a couple of days ago?  Let's start with that  and I don't want to bring that up.  But I'm just saying,  I love,  I love all the Marvel comics 
[03:10:30]  and I grew up with that.  It was comics.  You're looking,  they weren't flying in the fucking air.  They were in your hand.  And you saw,  you know,  you saw Superman up,  up and away.  And you said,  oh,  mother of Jesus,  what a word.  And then you go to school  and,  Pat,  yes,  what did you do today?  I said,  I read Superman.  And she goes,  did he say up,  up and away?  He didn't say shit.  I had to read it.  But it was something,  you know,  and my father goes,  I put the comic book down.  You know,  you can read comic books  in front of your family. 
[03:11:00]  No.  Why?  What?  No.  He says,  read the paper to find out  what the fuck is going on.  He says,  why are you taking away fighting?  I says,  what about Mussolini?  He says,  Mussolini was a great.  Why?  Because he made a road  so we can get the fuck out of there.  That's called natural humor.  He just schooled you.  That's it.  Totally schooled me.  That's it.  I love you guys.  You're not your friends.  I don't see you too often.  Thank you so much.  God bless you. 
[03:11:30]  God bless you.  One's still on the web.  Listen,  you need a few dollars.  He's married.  He's probably got a fucking gun.  Yeah,  Sam's probably got  the little nest egg.  PatCooper.com.  Steve Wright.  And we got  the Count Basie Theater  in Red Bank,  New Jersey,  August 18th.  I highly recommend  you see Pat Cooper.  Highly recommend it.  He's unbelievable.  September 13th  at the Purchase College  in Purchase,  New York  with Susie Esman  at the Performing Arts Center.  September 13th  with Pat Cooper.  I worked with him twice  at the MGM.  Wait,  wait,  wait,  why don't you tell everybody,  Pat?  I used to jump on my... 
[03:12:00]  Tell everybody.  I used to work,  I mean,  when I worked  with the Jackson 5,  Mike was so small  and he used to come  to my dressing room  and Mrs. Jackson  would say to me,  Mr. Cooper,  is your bonnet?  He's wonderful.  It was such a wonderful  little thing.  And I'm saying,  you know,  they became a giant.  Yeah.  But you saw the talent  when he went on that stage.  And I'm reading now  this thing is not over.  Oh, yeah.  Oh,  that's breaking the family apart.  At least with my family  it was wonderful.  I said,  goodbye.  And that was it.  Goodbye.  That's something that works. 
[03:12:30]  Right.  You know,  it's 50 years.  They still got hate.  But here's the good thing.  I said,  when I die,  I'm going to leave you  a pound of hate.  Who the fuck  are you going to hate?  What is your first name?  Sam.  You don't look like  a Sam.  You look like an Anthony.  Am I finished?  If you want to be.  No,  I'm asking you.  It's up to you.  It's 9 o'clock.  It's up to me.  It's 10 o'clock.  Let's get the fuck out of here.  We'll get the fuck out of here.  Are you finished for the day?  Yeah.  Wait a minute. 
[03:13:00]  Do you go on vacation  in a couple of weeks?  Maybe.  You want already?  No.  Where are you going?  I don't know.  Stay home.  A beach.  Stay home.  Stay home.  What's the beach?  What do you mean?  Maybe go to a beach.  Jersey or something.  Take care of your kids.  I will, Pat Cooper.  Jersey.  I will.  You know that.  Pat,  thanks so much.  Always a pleasure.  Thanks, Pat.  Thank you.  Take care of my kids.  That's what happened to you.  Yes, it was.  Thank you, Pat.  Told me to take care of my kids  because this could happen to them  and points at Anthony.  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[03:13:30]  All right.  We're going to hold it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We're taking a picture.  Everybody's taking a picture.  Everybody's taking a picture together.  Everybody together.  Everybody together.  There we go.  There's Anthony and...  A legend.  Beautiful.  A legend.  There it is.  There it is.  There you go.  Give me a hug.  All right.  All right.  Picture time.  Picture time.  Hey, tell North I said that.  I will.  He missed you.  He wanted to be here.  I'm out of here.  If you were in the Apple store with him.  The Apple store? 
[03:14:00]  If you had a camera crew.  After Canada, tell North it's the Yucatan.  A hearing impaired person showing him the iPhone.  Oh.  Oh, that must have been fun.  Thank you.  I thought he was a kid.  Lots of the two of them.  Do you have any kids?  All right.  Hold on, because they can wind up like you're the one.  Use that, younger.  I know.  It's funny when he's referring to me.  I'm not saying nothing.  I'm a star.  I'm not saying nothing.  I'm a star.  All right.  There we go.  Oh, my God.  I know it.  I love it, though. 
[03:14:30]  I am exhausted.  I love it, though.  You just pick up on weird things he says.  Just exhausted.  Steve, thank you, buddy.  Take it easy.  Take care of Pat for us, all right?  He's all right.  And remind him that it's not once a year.  It's twice a year with this guy.  He had the same shoes.  He had two left shoes on yesterday.  Holy shit.  He had two left shoes on yesterday.  I thought he was going to get it.  I said, why are you wearing it?  Wait, get on, Mike.  We're still on.  I feel like I have two left shoes.  I'm still on the air.  Well, he's still on the air.  Are you still on the air?  Yeah.  He's telling us.  Goodbye, everybody.  Why are you still on the air?  Because Steve's telling us you wore two left shoes yesterday. 
[03:15:00]  I was telling him about your shoes yesterday.  Will you buy the same shoes?  I'm joking.  It's 10 o'clock.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, they haven't said goodbye yet.  We're ready to say goodbye.  Did you get the check?  I didn't get it yet.  Say goodbye.  Goodbye, world.  Remember, he's a fucking bully.  Thanks.  Take it easy.  There they go.  Who's the bullseye?  There they go.  I think he's talking about Howard Stern.  Holy shit.  Lock the door. 
[03:15:30]  I completely agree, by the way.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Fuck him.  Oh, my God.  I'm exhausted.  Ted Cooper's guy just depressed me.  He told me that he had a 28-year-old son, but he was working in TV and making lots of  money.  Oh, really?  See what happens?  You had to rub it in?  Yeah.  That fork in the road.  You're a piece of shit.  That's what he just said, pretty much.  Yeah, well.  Hey, Sam, you're a piece of shit.  That's why I host the shit show.  Yeah, exactly.  I'm just going to make him come back in.  He said it's over.  No, I'm leaving.  He's over.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  Oh, I can't. 
[03:16:00]  I can't.  I'm exhausted.  Huh?  I'm exhausted from him.  I could just listen to him, though.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  That was one.  That was...  We should call the Guinness Book of World Records.  Yeah.  That was the longest sentence ever.  There was never a period in there.  There were a couple commas and a couple dot, dot, dots, but no period.  He just keeps going.  I'm going to have one of the interns go back over the hour and give me all the audio of  you guys talking and just see how long you guys talk versus him. 
[03:16:30]  Let's go, oh, yeah, yeah, right, yeah.  Do people understand he can't hear a word?  Well, you had to yell every question.  He still answered them wrong.  And the weird part is I'm not that much further away from him than him.  No.  No, but I was projecting, too.  I was like, so...  I was trying.  I got a sore throat now.  And you got to really articulate the words.  Yeah.  I moved my lips a lot.  Yeah.  That's why he doesn't listen.  No.  He can't hear.  This is all good and fine and well, but...  Yeah, we got to go.  I'd like to just, you know, get the fuck out of here. 
[03:17:00]  I'm just saying this great show today, guys.  Oh, really, really.  Really well done.  Yes.  You did it again.  You pulled it off.  People are writing me about the Pat Cooper.  My brother loves them and others.  And Pat Cooper's amazing.  And the quote, this is not fun.  This is not life.  This is a prison.  This is a prison.  It's just your place on earth.  Your place on earth.  Hilarious.  Dignity.  Jesus Christ.  He's a fucking...  He's an original. 
[03:17:30]  Pat Cooper.  Holy fuck.  That old codger.  83.  I know.  With energy like that.  Amazing, right?  For an hour.  And he continues like that as soon as he leaves, too.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  He don't stop.  That's not a put on.  All day.  Imagine all of your waking hours are just yelling like that.  And just, like, just going on and on.  It keeps the cholesterol out of your fucking body.  Maybe.  Maybe that's why he's...  He pushes all that shit out.  Yeah.  Way more calories to yell than to just talk. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah.  Burning them.  Yeah, yeah.  He's burning lots of calories like that.  I can't wait for him to turn on us someday.  I don't even know what he's mad at.  I don't know.  That was very funny when Obie said, what's your problem with Howard?  And he just went somewhere else.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't even know if he ever addressed that part of it.  Apparently he's a bully.  And then the best part, my favorite part of the whole thing was that it goes, wait a minute.  So who are you mad at now?  Yeah, yeah.  I forgot.  David Steinberg.  David Steinberg.  I didn't even know David Steinberg had a show. 
[03:18:30]  I know.  I don't either.  He might be canceled, but he might be canceled.  Oh, my God.  Maybe that's why he's not on.  Steinberg was in, ah, he's an old comic.  I never thought the guy was funny.  He was big back in, like, the 70s.  What was he known for?  I forgot even.  He was big in the 70s.  No, I know, but what was his thing?  Just kind of observational comedy.  But was he in movies?  Stand-up.  Was he on a big TV show?  I don't remember.  No, he was a stand-up.  What was his highlight?  And then he had a little variety show type thing, the David Steinberg show.  Barely remember him.  I know the name. 
[03:19:00]  I know the face when I see him.  He would say, like, ooga-booga.  Oh, that's funny.  That was a big thing.  He would go, like, ooga-booga into the camera, and people would be like, ah, this is hoot.  Why?  Because there was a fucking Vietnam War going on.  I don't know.  People were fucking laughing at anything.  That sounds stupid.  As long as it wasn't body bags.  As long as it wasn't body bags!  Eric just told me in my ear, Steinberg show that Pat Cooper is so mad about not getting on  was on the air from 2005 to 2007.  Oh, my God.  He's holding a five-year grudge. 
[03:19:30]  He doesn't let it go.  I don't even do that.  He doesn't let it go.  It's five years.  When I hold a grudge, it's because I got new shit on somebody.  But like you said, he's a man.  Holy fuck.  And if he doesn't like you, he'll say, I don't like you.  I don't like you.  I got to acknowledge it's still a little too soon.  But Brian Deer Park, when you wrote, I wish this guy was in a certain Batman theater in  Colorado, kind of made me howl.  Oh, now.  I know it's too soon.  I know it's too soon.  Oh, guys.  All right.  I'm out of here.  Yeah, let's get the fuck out of here.  All right.  Have fun with your little show. 
[03:20:00]  It's over.  It's over.  All right.  Fuck.  The Opie and Anthony show is pretty much over.  Pretty much over.  Pretty much over.  But if you feel like sticking around after One Day Live is next.  Next.  Next.  Next. </pre>
