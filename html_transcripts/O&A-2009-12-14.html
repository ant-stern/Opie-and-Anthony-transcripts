<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a furious discussion about the upcoming "Homeless Shopping Spree." Opie and Anthony vehemently criticized their "rookie" production staff for the event's logistical nightmare, blaming excessive lawyer involvement for the last-minute scramble to secure a mall location just four days before the scheduled date.  They lamented the loss of the event's spontaneous nature, contrasting their usual "asking for forgiveness, not permission" approach with the current over-managed and legally restricted version.  The hosts also alluded to significant personal changes affecting their participation, alongside Jimmy Norton's absence.  Ridicule was heaped upon alternative venue suggestions like Costco and a Hard Rock Cafe.  Interspersed with this were unrelated segments: a listener’s account of a homeless musician’s rendition of Radiohead’s "Creep," Opie's confident prediction of a New York Jets victory over the Indianapolis Colts ("Bank on it!"), and a mysterious anecdote about a removed YouTube video featuring a controversial birthday wish.  Profane and vulgar language was liberally used throughout this segment.

The show then transitioned into a series of prank calls centered on outrageous birthday wishes, followed by a detailed and graphic description of a Times Square shooting involving a shakedown artist and a police officer.  The hosts’ amusement at the prank calls was evident, and they played audio from a conservative talk radio show (Armstrong and Getty) reacting to one of the calls.  The discussion also covered MTV's removal of a clip showing Snooki being punched on *Jersey Shore*, with a humorous analysis of MTV's reasoning.  A significant portion focused on Tiger Woods' infidelity scandal, including a humorous sex addiction quiz.  Mike "The Situation" Sorrentino from *Jersey Shore* participated in a phone interview.

This led into a more extensive discussion of the sex addiction quiz, with Opie, Anthony, and a third, unidentified host participating.  They dissected nine ambiguous questions, speculating on the answers' implications and contrasting them with normal behavior, particularly focusing on Tiger Woods' potential responses.  This segued into a much longer 40-question sex and love addiction questionnaire, resulting in candid and graphic answers and commentary on pornography, infidelity, and various sexual behaviors. The discussion continued on Tiger Woods' scandal, referencing Jamie Jungers' claims and playing audio of her interview, with the hosts reacting negatively and using offensive language.  Listener calls further fueled the conversation about sex addiction, Tiger Woods, and the media's portrayal of the scandal.

The focus remained on Tiger Woods' scandal, with speculation on his career's future and the short attention span of the American public.  A caller, Jason from Texas, harshly criticized the women involved.  The conversation shifted to a scathing critique of sports columnist Phil Mushnick, with vulgar and sexually explicit commentary, including the invention of a fictional skin condition, "Mushnick."  The hosts contrasted Mushnick's criticism of Woods with Charles Barkley's defense, highlighting a perceived double standard.  This segment featured a studio visit from Odorous of GWAR, in full costume, who engaged in sexually suggestive and vulgar banter with the hosts.  A GWAR intern, Graham, participated in a comedic bit.  Odorous discussed GWAR's tour experiences, his appearance on *Red Eye*, metal music opinions, anecdotes about Lemmy Kilmister of Motorhead (including his Nazi memorabilia), and his upcoming web television station.  The segment concluded with further discussion of Odorous's costume and its lingering effect on the studio green room.

The final segment opened with jokes about Odorous's departure and the lingering smell, anticipating the arrival of another guest, "Ronifaz," with similar olfactory concerns.  The hosts searched for a character named "Iraq" to smell Odorous's vacated seat.  The show then played a series of vulgar messages from listeners on the "F.U." line, targeting bosses, ex-wives, and coworkers, including a self-deprecating message from former Governor Jesse Ventura about a loss to "little Jimmy Norton."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is dangerous.  There's nothing in the Bible that says you can't tongue an asshole.  Psychotic, sexual, devious.  I just want to take it in the shitter like a good fruit. 
[00:00:30]  Really, it is a very, very bad thing.  Don't fuck yourself.  It's unbelievable.  I love it.  We know we're great.  Everyone knows we're great.  Complete horseshit.  This show is never short of characters.  We're just dicks.  We don't get you one way.  We fuck you the other way.  This is like what goes on in a mental institution.  Cookie, cookie, cookie.  Hi, I'm the Opie and Anthony Virus.  And I'm here to infect you with hilarity.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's do this.  Yeah.  Here it is.  Good morning, everybody.  Here we are.  Don't fret.  We're back from a weekend.  So I've been holding back for three days.  Really?  You know, when you come, it's going to go fucking really high.  It's going to hit the ceiling.  Yeah.  That's the best about holding back.  Woo!  There she blows!  Yeah.  No, the only reason I hold back for three days is because we don't do weekend radio. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  Got an email.  A few emails, yeah.  Got an email over the weekend.  I don't even know what day.  I think it was on Friday, though.  And, you know, people laugh when I yell and scream and say...  No, they don't.  I don't want to work with rookies.  But I don't want to work with rookies.  I don't want to work with people that don't understand our show and how things are done.  I don't believe...  You said rookies, not retards. 
[00:02:00]  Oh, shit.  Stupid Canadians fan.  Travis loves the Canadians.  Yeah, I've married one.  Oh.  How do we start this?  So, the homeless shopping spree is in four days.  Four days, yeah!  Come on, everyone.  Let's get pumped.  Have fun.  Let's get hot.  No?  Yeah, I don't...  Yeah, well...  Have a good time.  Yeah, there's a lot of things going on.  Have fun.  I don't think Jimmy officially could do it. 
[00:02:30]  I don't think we officially could do it.  It's a clusterfuck.  I'm not even going to lie to you.  And the reason it's a clusterfuck is because we work with rookies.  People that work for this channel are rookies.  And it has to be said.  Is it rookies or is it a complete lack of understanding of what...  This show is about and what we've done to be successful?  No, no, no, no.  They're rookies. 
[00:03:00]  I'll explain why they're rookies, Ant.  All right.  Because they're in the game.  This is like, quote, the majors.  The game.  Right.  So they were brought up from the Miners, which is some shit radio market from somewhere.  Mm-hmm.  And they are working among us.  Yes.  In the big leagues.  And they're rookies because they don't really understand what the major leagues are all about yet.  Right.  And I don't feel like sitting around waiting for them to catch up.  Mm-hmm.  This homeless shopping spree has been a clusterfuck from day one.  And I explained it to these guys that if you're going to do the homeless shopping spree, it's got to be done our way. 
[00:03:30]  And if you don't want to do it our way, then fine.  We pass on the bit.  We just pass on and we don't do it.  Mm-hmm.  And I didn't even know we were doing the homeless shopping spree until about two weeks ago.  And I'm not even going to mention names because they're all guilty of something.  But someone goes, they really are.  They really are.  We'll call them Mondays because no one likes Mondays. 
[00:04:00]  They came to us a couple weeks ago and said, good news, we're doing the homeless shopping spree.  And I basically gave up on the homeless shopping spree this year.  We're like, really?  Oh, we are, aren't we?  Wow, really?  And then they're like, somebody rolled their eyes at me and said, well, come on, man.  We've been working on this for three months.  And that's when I said, three months.  This is something that should have taken a day.  You don't need three months to work on the homeless shopping spree.  You just say, we're doing it.  If you understand the homeless shopping spree and if you understand the Opie and Anthony show.  See, understanding the homeless shopping spree and understanding the Opie and Anthony show would mean you do your research and go, wow, how did it work in the past? 
[00:04:30]  Well, I'll explain how it worked in the past.  Anthony and I, very, how did you call it earlier?  It was like a grassroots thing.  Very grassroots, very just kind of, yeah, gather some homeless people together.  Right.  Talk to them on the air over an extended period of time, not one week.  Not shoving it down everyone's throat in a week because we just found out we are doing it.  So this way, everybody kind of has a vested interest, knows the characters. 
[00:05:00]  Correct.  Knows everybody and can appreciate when they do something funny or silly or whatever.  And gather them up.  At the last minute, announce a mall.  And years past, we announced the mall pretty much the day of the event.  While the bus was on the way.  Yeah, maybe some of the regulars, hardcore, inner circle fans, you know, got word where the mall's going to be.  Yeah.  By keeping their ear to the, you know, to the pavement or tracks or the trail. 
[00:05:30]  And then, very generically, very grass rooty, we go to the mall and we shop at the homeless.  Everyone has a great time.  And we broadcast the whole damn thing.  And before you know it, we're out of that mall and everyone's like, holy shit, that's one of the most amazing radio events I've ever been a part of.  Yeah, it's a bunch of listeners show up.  They shop.  They buy stuff for the homeless.  The homeless have a great time.  And it's a charity event, literally, without it looking like we're doing some stupid charity event. 
[00:06:00]  Correct.  It's funny.  It works.  It works on all levels.  It works for the show because it's a great, like, a great piece of radio.  It's fun listening.  It brings more listeners, in this case, to our channel.  Right.  It brings in revenue for the company.  All these things.  And it, amazingly enough, helps the homeless buy coats and stuff like that.  Sure.  And you get listener exposure to the program.  And that's the basics of the homeless shopping spree. 
[00:06:30]  And the mall makes it up by making some money.  They make some.  Yeah, exactly.  Not only the homeless shopping, all the listeners go, you know what, I'm at a mall.  I'm going to shop today.  And they buy stuff for the homeless.  So it's like.  Right.  A bunch of listeners walk out with a lot of bags of stuff because they're like, I might  as well do my shopping while I'm here.  So that's the basics.  That's how it works.  That's the basics of the bit and how the show works.  And that's why they're rookies down the hall because they don't, they didn't even do the  basic research for this damn thing.  They decided, well, if we're going to do the homeless shopping spree, we got to get the  lawyers involved. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  Even though we've done four or five of these, never really had the lawyers involved and  never had one, one.  We never had one problem or one issue.  Not a one.  Know who had a problem with this?  The media.  And God forbid if Opie and Anthony are plastered all over the media.  Yeah.  They had a problem with this.  For no reason, by the way, because nothing went wrong.  Right.  So they get the lawyers involved.  And what are the lawyers going to do?  They're not going to green light shit.  Why would they?  So they spent, I don't know, weeks, maybe a month, two months, you know, going back and 
[00:07:30]  forth with the lawyers instead of doing other things that could be done around here.  Finally, they get it approved.  And then, then these brainiacs down the hall, these fucking dopes, these fucking rookies,  I've had it.  I've had it.  They're like, well, now all we have to do is get permission from a mall.  And I'm sitting there.  I'm like, I even said to Ann, I'm like, let's just sit back.  I can watch this silliness. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  I said, I said, let's just sit back and watch and watch these dopes.  Watch this.  Just go in in flames.  Right.  So spinning in flames.  So pavement.  To make a long story short, they pretty much went from mall to mall to mall to mall.  And then these idiots, these dopes, these rookies actually came back to Ann and I and said,  well, we talked to such and such mall and the security's like, okay, that sounds good.  And they're all happy.  And I go, no, Ann, just keep sitting back and watch. 
[00:08:30]  Let's, let's, let's look in.  And then another day or two goes by because what happened was the security at the mall,  of course, is going to call their corporate office.  Yes.  Next thing you know, there's lawyers and cease and desist letters.  The fax machine was just spitting out cease and desist.  You go to our mall.  We're going to have a problem.  We'll get everyone arrested.  Blah, blah, blah.  Stay away from this mall.  Stay away.  Don't go to here.  Don't do this.  Don't do that.  If you're caught in the parking lot, blah, blah, blah.  One company actually said, do not show up at any of our malls. 
[00:09:00]  And they just happened to, I don't know, own hundreds of malls.  Every mall.  They even said, don't show up at our malls in Kansas City, Des Moines.  Like, just in case we got stupid and decided we're going to, like, take this out of New York City.  It's that mall company where when you buy a gift certificate to a mall, that's the mall.  Right.  And you can go anywhere with that gift certificate.  And late last week, we had a mall that, according to these idiots, agreed to the homeless shopping spree, right?  Yeah.  So, like, I had to sit back.  Let's sit back now.  This isn't over yet. 
[00:09:30]  Sit the fuck back.  And we...  Let's sit back and watch.  See, the monkey's going to...  They're going to type some Hemingway.  Right.  They're going to...  Oh, look, they're throwing shit at each other.  Right.  Oh, okay.  See, they said they were going to type Hemingway.  Right.  But they're throwing shit at each other.  Right.  That's exactly what it is.  So, we said on Thursday or Friday that we will announce the mall today.  And we had a mall, but I kind of knew that we probably didn't have.  Well, you know where this is going. 
[00:10:00]  So, I think it was Friday afternoon.  Hold off on announcing the mall because we don't have a mall.  Because the mall we thought we had, they finally got, you know, word from their corporate office.  No, we don't want the homeless shopping spree at this mall.  Yeah.  Which, by the way, there should be some outrage.  I think we should get a press release out there that no mall wants our charity.  You know something?  Because in the end, this is a charity thing.  This does bring awareness to the homeless.  It takes care of homeless people. 
[00:10:30]  They buy jackets, shoes, warm clothes, hats, everything.  And they leave.  You show me one homeless guy that was on any of these homeless sprees during the years that didn't leave very happy and with a lot of stuff they could use.  And the awareness.  When the media gets involved with it and just the general buzz of the ONA community passing it to other people that might not listen to the O.P. and Anthony show.  With Mayor Menino bitching about it one year as he's claiming we're going out and counting the homeless. 
[00:11:00]  Right.  That's what he, that's his contribution, was counting the homeless.  Right.  And we were bringing a few in to, you know, get some warm clothes and shit.  And we were taking care of the homeless.  He was the only dummy to ever have a problem with it.  A problem with it.  What's the fucking problem?  Same people that had a problem with the ad that everybody else got for Adult Swim.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I know.  Is it such a big deal that we're exploiting the homeless for good radio?  You know what?  If they get something good out of it and it's fun radio, which it is, what's the problem? 
[00:11:30]  What the fuck's the problem?  So we get this email, I think it was Friday, and they said, hold off on announcing the mall on Monday because the mall we thought we had, we don't have.  So we're four days away from the homeless shopping spree.  This is just not how it's done, by the way, and that's the point I'm trying to make today.  We don't have a mall.  We don't have a mall.  We have one mall left.  That they're, I guess, asking once again today if we could go to their mall for the homeless shopping spree. 
[00:12:00]  One mall left.  We couldn't get the mall, like, in Day of the Dead.  Right.  Zombies walking around.  Well, a zombie might be upset.  And this is, the point is really simple.  There's only one way to do this bit, and if you can't do the bit our way, then we can't do it.  But this is not how the bit is done. 
[00:12:30]  No.  No one is going to grant you permission.  I even wrote in the email back, and I was very professional, believe it or not.  I didn't motherfuck anybody.  I said, look, in the past we've always asked for forgiveness, not permission.  That's how it works.  Yeah.  And look at our track record.  I said, not one problem with this thing.  The fans couldn't be cooler.  Yeah.  They couldn't be cooler when it comes to this.  They're cheering and helping out the homeless and just having a real good time without causing any problems. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  Because when we need the fans to behave, believe it or not, they behave.  Exactly.  They're not lunatics like you think they might be.  Exactly.  It's a good event.  And that's why I yell and scream that I don't want to work with rookies, and we have rookies all around us that don't get the show and don't get how these events work.  And I'm more than willing to go.  And I even said in the email, I'm like, look, we should just cancel the thing.  I'd rather the listeners remember the homeless shopping spree for what it was, an amazing radio event, than do some watered-down, lame-ass version, 
[00:13:30]  which I guarantee they're going to shove down our throats this week because now there's money involved.  Now there's a vested interest from sales, which is, you know, a big part of the business.  And for being as difficult as we are...  We're not difficult, though.  Exactly.  I was being extremely sarcastic.  Because that's the problem.  We end up...  For being...  Oh, sorry, sorry.  No, just for being as difficult as we are, we do notice and know when money is at stake for the company 
[00:14:00]  and do whatever we can to help out and make sure, you know, we do get the revenue in.  But we can't do it at the price of a benchmark thing that we've done over the years that has been great  and have it suck ass because too many fucking hands are in the pot, as they say,  and don't know what they're talking about.  It's lawyers.  It's too many lawyers involved.  Yes.  Lawyers wreck everything. 
[00:14:30]  It shouldn't have been involved.  They wreck everything.  And there's something else that I was only made aware of the last few days.  Well, and I's deal has drastically changed.  So now I have major issues with this homeless shopping spree.  Because I don't feel like taking any chances.  I'm not taking one ounce of a risk.  For what?  Jimmy...  I've already said I'm not doing it.  Yeah, Jimmy will definitely not be in the homeless shopping...  Will not be doing the homeless shopping spree.  He can't afford to do it.  Let's just put it that way. 
[00:15:00]  He can't afford to do it.  And I don't know if we can.  And stupid Bob better get on the phone and figure that shit out immediately.  Immediately.  Yeah.  It's...  I don't know.  We can't get into details.  No, I know.  I'm trying to be as vague as possible.  Those are...  Yeah.  But I did not realize that was part of the whole thing either.  I just don't understand why we can't go shopping with a bunch of our friends. 
[00:15:30]  Why can't we just do it like we did in the old days where it's like, okay, we're just  sending some people out to a mall to do some fucking shopping.  No one else that...  You could take 20 fucking people to the mall and friends and go, hey, it's a shopping day.  We're going to the fucking mall.  And not have to sign waivers and agreements and fucking liability and all kinds of other shit.  You're going shopping.  Like, what if we wanted to go shopping? 
[00:16:00]  Me and Opie.  We're like, hey...  Well, that would mean we'd have to hang out with each other.  I think we could stomach it for a day.  We could go old school.  Yeah, let's go old school.  That's us fucking around.  Because people are like, I get it.  You don't like Anthony.  Shut the fuck up.  You don't get shit.  Let's say this Thursday we decided, blow off work.  And we just decide we're going to go to a mall and do some Christmas shopping.  Christmas is coming up.  Right.  Now, we don't want to do it alone.  Because, you know, obviously we can't carry on a conversation amongst ourselves for more than five minutes. 
[00:16:30]  Well, let me go with this, though.  Let me go with this.  Yeah.  If we were going to go to a mall on Thursday, we're Long Islanders, so I would assume it would be easy to pick you up and either go to a mall close to your house.  Yeah, yeah.  I can only think of two malls we could possibly shop at Thursday.  The Roosevelt Field Mall.  Right.  Or the Walt Whitman Mall.  Exactly.  Why are you saying no?  It's just me and Ann fucking shopping. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, no, no, no.  I was going to say because that's part of that parent company.  Oh, we know.  No, we know that.  We know that.  But I've got to do my Christmas shopping.  And I'm saying if Ann and I decide Thursday that we're taking the day off because we want to get a jump on Christmas shopping, those would be the two malls I would go to.  I want to say the fucking piece of paper that says I can't shop at the Roosevelt Field Mall.  You show me the piece of paper that this company got that says Anthony Cumia cannot shop at the Roosevelt Field Mall. 
[00:17:30]  Show me it.  I will fucking challenge that in a second.  I will have fucking someone arrested.  I have my rights.  I can't walk into the mall and go shopping?  All right.  Now let's take it a step further.  Okay.  It's me and Opie walking into the mall.  Okay.  Is that okay?  Are we breaching some type of contract that was sent?  A cease and desist.  A fucking, some kind of letter that says we can't go. 
[00:18:00]  I doubt it.  We could go shopping there.  Sure.  Now let's go a little further.  What if we want to bring a couple of friends with us?  That smell?  Mustard.  Maybe they're smelly.  I don't know.  I promised Mustard a new guitar so I got to get him a new guitar and I don't know shit about guitars, Anthony.  Right.  So I would have to have Mustard with me and go, which one of these guitars would work for you, sir?  He knows.  So I would have to have Mustard at least.  And my buddy Joe.  And Joe, well.  I want Joe to go.  He's my pal.  What are you going to?  I need one.  What are you going to paint him?  I need one friend. 
[00:18:30]  What are you going to paint him?  Of color.  Jesus.  And now would we get in trouble for that?  Where's the line?  What has to happen before it becomes something that this piece of paper can be enforceable on?  What has to happen?  Is it a cell phone call?  If all of a sudden we make a cell phone call and go, hey, what are you doing?  Hanging out at the Roosevelt Field Mall.  I got a few friends.  We're doing a little shopping. 
[00:19:00]  What are you picking up?  Some shoes?  Yeah, we got that.  Don't worry about it.  I'll pay for that.  Is that now illegal in some way?  Is that against a fucking order of protection?  A restraining order?  A C&D?  Let me add this to the whole mix.  I just...  Firearms.  What?  I just changed to Uber Twitter.  Yeah.  Oopsie.  Oopsie.  Everyone knows where I am right now because of Uber Twitter.  Oopsie.  Oh, okay.  See?  Wow, that's weird. 
[00:19:30]  It has my exact location.  Oh, I should have turned that off before I went shopping.  I'm going to be bothered at the mall while I try to buy a present for mommy.  Oopsie.  Oh, my God.  So, that was the email over the weekend.  And then I wrote them back and no one wrote me.  So, now we're here on a Monday when we're supposed to be announcing, like, major details for the homeless shopping spree.  Sorry, and what? 
[00:20:00]  And what now?  And what now to the people down the hall that had well over three months to figure this whole thing out?  Now we're four days out and don't have a mall.  What now, rookies?  What now?  And some of the, let's just say, alternate suggestions I have heard have...  Well, it got back to us.  You really should just say it, Ann.  ...have been a laugh riot.  Just say it, because...  And to protect the staff, and this is the God's honest truth, three staff members came to me with one of the ideas that was thrown around. 
[00:20:30]  Here's one of the ideas.  Oh, yeah, Danny, just put this on it.  This is good.  Can't we do something at a venue?  Someone said that?  Yes.  That's not the homeless shopping spree.  Take the homeless to, like, the Hard Rock, and they were talking about actually...  Now, wasn't this something like having that stuff there for them to...  No, they didn't.  ...buy?  Nobody said that. 
[00:21:00]  I don't believe you.  I heard this.  Wait till you hear the...  It's like having stuff there, like a garage sale or a fucking flea market type thing set up in a venue, and they could walk around and buy things.  That's embarrassing.  It's embarrassing.  That's why sales and programming shouldn't socialize ever.  You're not fun people.  How about this one?  You don't understand programming.  How about this one?  What?  These were real things that were just kind of thrown around.  I didn't even believe that was the idea.  In a brainstorming meeting to how to, you know, save the homeless shopping spree. 
[00:21:30]  How about a...  How about someplace like Costco?  We have them close Costco early in the morning.  Meanwhile, not knowing...  We've been saying we're doing this in the afternoon.  Right.  They don't even know that.  We're not even doing mornings.  Close to the public.  Close to the public.  So there's no problems.  And the homeless people and their spotters and whatever.  What about the listeners?  No, no, no.  They're not allowed in. 
[00:22:00]  For real?  Yeah.  It's just the homeless and people like Sam and whatever walking in.  And they get to shop in an empty Costco.  So that if you get a phone call like this...  Hey, it's Sam.  Hi.  Yeah.  Joe's buying some hot dog buns.  Yeah.  No, no one's around.  There's no one else here.  I'll check in later.  Thanks.  That's great.  That's great.  I said before, it's like they took the Indy 500 and turned it into a special Olympics running race. 
[00:22:30]  It's not the homeless shopping spree.  Yeah.  And that's knowing the show and knowing the bit.  Right.  And you either do it our way or you should have never even tried to take this on.  Or just don't.  You can't ask permission.  No one is going to allow this. 
[00:23:00]  No one.  They're not going to allow it.  And we knew that in the past.  And between the time we get there with the homeless, they shop.  There's people.  They're doing things.  Between that time and the time the mall security and whatever it is comes up and finally finds someone in charge and goes,  Look, guys, got to clear out of here.  It's been enough time where it's been a great radio thing.  It's good.  That's how it ends.  They usher them off on the bus.  And they're left with a huge ovation.  And there's not a problem. 
[00:23:30]  Fucking rookies.  Rookies.  So now we're faced with a situation where this is Thursday.  We don't have a mall.  We have one left.  Perhaps.  They're going to say no, too.  They'll say no.  Of course they're going to say no.  But we have no mall.  Watch how they turn it on us.  Well, now that you guys talked about it on the air, yeah.  Oh, I'm sure.  You really ruined our chance of saving this.  You hit it right on the head.  We've been around the block long enough to know all the excuses you guys will come up with for the reason why you failed miserably on this one. 
[00:24:00]  This thing's on life support.  And we are ready to kick the plug out.  And because of circumstances, Jim Norton cannot do the homeless shopping spree.  He can't.  He officially can't do it.  And I don't think...  I don't think we can either.  If it's a decision I'm making, I won't do it.  I don't think we will either.  I mean, given certain things.  Well, Bob better get on the phone and...  Why would he?  Why would he?  Why would he actually read what was already written?  When I have other managers that can catch things he didn't... 
[00:24:30]  Holy shit.  So that's where we are to start another week of Fine Radio.  Our big event is pretty much, you know, pretty much fucked.  Yeah.  By the people down the hall.  Let's see.  That think we're difficult and they don't understand us really.  As it always works out exactly how we tell people it's going to work out.  You got in way over your heads.  When they said, oh, we've been working on this for three months. 
[00:25:00]  Really?  Have you?  In the past, you know what we did?  Hey, uh...  Homeless shopping spree.  Sometime in December.  Ah, we'll figure it out when we get closer.  That's how it works.  And then occasionally...  There was no figuring it out for three months.  Homeless would come in.  The figuring out part was just to get the lawyers on board.  Yeah.  Two to three months to get the lawyers on board.  Just to do the event.  Just to screw the event up.  And I'd imagine the lawyers were the ones that came up with the, 
[00:25:30]  well, you know, we'll allow this as long as, you know,  you get permission from the mall.  And then if you weren't a rookie down the hall,  that should have thrown up a red flag and go,  wow, I remember this from past years.  I don't know if that's even possible.  Yeah.  Let me look at...  I don't think that's possible.  Let me YouTube some of this and see what it was like.  Permission?  I don't think the guy's ever asked permission in the past.  And I don't think...  I don't know.  I don't think anyone's going to give permission for this.  No. 
[00:26:00]  That's just basic fucking thinking.  I...  I...  I...  I don't know what to say, what to do, what to think in this situation.  And, you know, I wrote them back professionally.  No one wrote back to me.  So probably because they, you know, were insulted by my intelligence.  I hit them with some knowledge.  Instead of the motherfucking that I could do.  I actually hit them with some knowledge, Jimmy. 
[00:26:30]  Some intelligence.  Some brains.  Brain power.  Oh, fuck.  And they just sat there and read my email and went...  Duh.  Uh.  How can we...  How can we...  Oh, man.  Why did I ever leave Des Moines Radio?  It was so much easier there.  Duh.  Does anybody know, like, that this isn't...  It's not something you could just do like this.  Like they want it done.  Look at that.  That's four days away. 
[00:27:00]  And we don't have a mall.  Are you fucking kidding me?  I'm looking at video of the shopping spree.  And it's amazing.  Yeah.  There's a thousand to two thousand people easily.  Everyone behaving.  Everyone just getting into the spirit of the thing.  Helping the homeless.  Helping the radio show.  Shopping themselves.  So this mall, whatever video we're looking at.  Yeah.  Which, by the way, not one problem.  You can see it for yourself.  It's not a hip-hop station.  Right.  They're shopping.  They got shopping bags.  Those people had no intention of going to that mall that day. 
[00:27:30]  Yep.  I think that's Roosevelt Field Mall, if I'm not mistaken.  It looks like you.  Was that the...  Who knows?  How many times did we do it, Dan?  Four?  We did at least four, maybe five, right?  At least four.  At least four.  I think we did two for XM.  Yeah.  We did two for XM, right?  And then that dumb, dope Tracy didn't want to do this.  Ugh.  I think the last one was...  Fuck, Dad.  The last one was 06.  Fucking bitch.  Huh?  The last one, I think, was 2006.  Yeah.  It's been three years.  And then I think we did at least two at NEW, I believe.  So I think we've done four. 
[00:28:00]  Four, maybe five.  The listeners would know that more than I...  Whatever.  It's not that important.  So there you go.  That's what happened over the weekend.  Hold off on announcing the mall, because we don't have a mall.  I'm like, okay.  You could take him to a book kiosk near Central Park.  Yeah, okay.  Stupid Bob, I wish I had his email.  He's now suggesting ideas, because that's what he does great for a living.  Oh, is that the Macy's one?  He said, why don't we just find a bunch of, what did he say, a bunch of stores, like a 
[00:28:30]  street that has a bunch of stores.  Like, we're trick-or-treating with the homeless, walking into fucking, like, strip mall.  They would just lock their doors, and that'd be that.  Yeah.  Let's find a street that just happens to have a bunch of stores that you could shop at,  something like that.  I deleted the emails.  I was so out of my mind.  I'm like, if I look at these emails anymore, I'm going to do something stupid.  Yeah, the Miracle Mile shopping spree, where it's like, just get out of here. 
[00:29:00]  So, there you go.  You know.  And then they look at us, like, these fucking guys, they're fucking difficult to work with.  Really?  We just want basic shit that we're not getting from you people.  Guys, good news.  We have a Staples that might be interested in the homeless shopping spree.  So, if they need anything like printer paper or office equipment, I'll be good.  I'll get back to you. 
[00:29:30]  Thanks.  Now what?  Wow, the phones.  That's all I can say.  Cell Medic has it.  Cell Medic's got it.  He's going to save the homeless shopping spree.  Go ahead, CM.  Hey, what about doing a homeless internet shopping spree?  There you go.  Bring it into the future. 
[00:30:00]  All I shopping is all the rage.  Hey, bring them together into one local spot and then, like, have a traveling virus.  That way you guys can come together.  You can have a big-ass party.  It's not the homeless shopping spree.  Thank you, CM.  Thank you.  I like the idea.  You got a good idea?  It's the future.  The internet.  A lot of people are shopping online.  How about internet homeless shopping spree?  We bring them in.  A bunch of computers.  And they can just order what they want and have it shipped to their address. 
[00:30:30]  Oh.  All right, I'll get back to you on that.  Mm-hmm.  Frankie Manhattan has a great...  Hey.  Well, the lawyers have to be careful that none of the homeless get carpal tunnel from working the mouse.  Yes.  Yes.  We have to actually send a legal notice to Bill Gates that they will be using Windows-based computers.  When the history of radio is written, it will say that lawyers ruined it.  This will be known as the Dark Ages. 
[00:31:00]  No, it'll...  The plague.  When the history of radio is finally written by someone, you know, smart enough to write a really good book about the history of radio,  they will have a whole thing about how lawyers just completely destroyed the spirit of radio.  Lawyers?  Lawyers really did.  Business?  It...  I can't just pin the blame on lawyers.  They're a huge, huge part of the responsibility of fucking things up.  But it's this corporate mentality, man, that is no chance-taking whatsoever. 
[00:31:30]  No...  Don't leave any of the creativity up to the talent.  Everything has to turn a buck.  They don't see the big picture where it's like, well, the event itself doesn't have to turn a buck.  You don't have to sponsor the shit out of every move we make, but it gets more people on board.  It gets awareness to the show, and then you get more money based on the popularity you've gotten.  That's how it's always worked.  So they fuck it up by not understanding that part of it. 
[00:32:00]  And we got two other huge ONA events that are in jeopardy, have fallen by the wayside.  The animation festival and the...  How could the animation festival be a problem?  How could they fuck that up?  And the travel virus.  How could they fuck that up, too?  Two-dimensional Americans are going to be angry.  That's how.  This is how.  But what's that got to do with them?  Everyone wants their peace.  Oh, they want money.  Everyone wants their peace.  Frank in Manhattan.  What's up, Frank?  Good morning, everybody.  Hey, Frank.  Frank in Manhattan.  I just can't believe that this year, when they're all talking about how nobody's going shopping, 
[00:32:30]  the economy sucks, that these malls are turning down thousands of dollars of guaranteed money.  Yeah.  What a bunch of morons.  That is not an exaggeration.  I mean, we give the homeless guys probably...  What was the money figure this year?  It always goes up.  Well, usually...  $100 to $200?  Usually it's like $100 to $200, but this year, because of the sponsors that were attached,  these guys were even going to get more than that.  All right, so they're going to get more than $200 a piece.  We'll have at least a dozen homeless guys probably. 
[00:33:00]  Okay, so that money's guaranteed spent, which is nothing.  I understand that.  But the listeners now are throwing money at the homeless.  The average homeless guy walks away with at least $1,000 worth of merchandise.  Yeah, that's a lot of stuff.  Safe to say, right?  And then all the listeners that go to that mall are definitely spending money because they're  in the mall and they're like, well, I got to shop.  It's bringing in a lot of money for the mall every year.  I have it.  A lot of fucking money.  And hold on.  The headline today is that we have to get this out, that malls are turning down this  big, huge Opie and Anthony charity event. 
[00:33:30]  It has to be pushed out there.  But I don't know who works in PR here.  I don't know any of those people.  Why would they come down and go, wow, there's a story within a story here.  Let's throw a press release out there that all these malls are saying no to Opie and Anthony's  charitable event.  Homeless shopping spree.  Thank you, Frank.  You're right, though.  With the economy, this is great to get people shopping and spending in their mall.  If I was a mall owner, I'd go, Jesus, guys, please come to my mall. 
[00:34:00]  Bring them in.  Yes, Jimmy.  I have the best way we can do this.  The homeless shopping spree.  Everyone.  You have people buy gifts from the homeless and bring them here.  You let the lawyers look at them, make sure that they're safe.  Yes.  And the lawyers approve them.  Yeah.  And then everybody has fun while the homeless open their gifts.  Is it like a grab bag kind of a thing?  No.  Homeless grab bag?  No, no, no, no, no, no, because they have to sign off, because they may grab something 
[00:34:30]  that's going to injure them.  Oh, a paper cut or a sharp edge on the box.  Yeah, we can't have that.  Yes, reaching into a grab bag, so the gifts have to be handed to them.  In a two-foot radius of the homeless.  It's very simple.  When unfun people are involved in trying to make fun, they destroy it.  Yes.  They're not creative, and this is with all aspects of entertainment.  Uncreative, unfunny people are dictating what is creatively and funny appropriate.  And they just think at it. 
[00:35:00]  Terrible.  It's all areas of entertainment.  Because they have no concept.  When they come up with some of these ideas, and people that are on this side of the microphones,  on our side of the microphones, listen to what they're saying, and look like,  you've got to be shitting me.  And then they look like, well, these people are difficult.  Oh, we can't work with them.  It's like, no, you're the difficult one.  You're not understanding what we do on this side of the fucking mic.  At least they do us a favor, and they wear suits and ties to work, to go, hey, unfunny 
[00:35:30]  person coming through.  Here it comes, their unfunny costume they wear.  Yeah, you see him coming, like, okay, that's an unfunny person.  He's walking down the hall, so let's avoid him.  If someone was walking down the hall like Charlie Chaplin in a clown suit going,  I'd be going, come on in here.  Funny person.  Out of the way.  Tell us how the homeless shopping spree's done.  Right.  But when I see a fucking Armani suit walking down the hallway, I see unfunny.  Really?  What did you do in radio?  In front of a microphone.  Nothing.  That's why you're wearing a fucking tie. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, God.  Let's go to Ray on Long Island.  Ray.  Yes, sir.  Hey.  Oh, you doesn't have to call him Ray.  You don't like that, bitch?  No, I hate it.  What's up, Ray?  I can't take it.  Let me ask you a serious question.  Do you guys, as a radio show, the O&A show, do you have your own attorney that you guys  can go to with your ideas to try to form them, how to introduce corporate, or do you just run 
[00:36:30]  to corporate with your ideas?  We don't run to nobody.  I use Binder and Binder.  I like his hat.  Yes, mine is Joel Steinberg.  He's my attorney.  If you're going to Binder and Binder, I think you have a physical security problem.  You're at the end of your own.  Yeah, exactly.  I think the real faithful listeners understand that we had to drastically change our show.  We had to drastically change our show. 
[00:37:00]  We don't do all the events we used to do.  We don't hang out in public as much as we do.  Because all the stuff we used to do, we can't do anymore.  We just can't do it.  Whether this is regular radio or satellite radio, you can't do the stuff we used to do  five, six years ago.  We'll get you in the homeless shopping spree.  You have enough to worry about.  What about going to Walmart?  What?  Shut up.  Here's a guy that should be working down the hall.  Ricky, you should be working down the hall with these guys. 
[00:37:30]  Why would it work if we go to Walmart?  Why not?  It'll work.  It's like a mall in a store.  He's saying there's all aspects of a mall.  It's a massive...  It's not the event that we came up with many years ago.  And they'd never fucking...  You know what the event used to be?  Walmart is going to sign off on it?  You know what the real event used to be, and it has been watered down slightly over the  years, where we go to a snooty mall.  Right.  That's where this whole thing started.  We go to a place...  Started at the Short Hills Mall.  We've all seen these malls where they fucking have the attitude and the high-end products 
[00:38:00]  and the fucking bitches walking around thinking their shit don't stink.  That...  Isn't this great?  And then we come sweeping in with smelly homeless people...  Yeah.  ...and take over their mall for a few hours and giving them a big fuck you.  That's what the event officially started as.  It's been watered down, but it still kind of works.  But it's not going to be watered down anymore.  That's right.  I've seen some Walmart customers.  They probably wouldn't notice we were bringing the homeless in.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Hi, there's greeters. 
[00:38:30]  John in Texas.  You can take them to a shelter and have them shop, then to a soup kitchen.  Oh, these ideas will be suggested in the coming couple of days, by the way, because they're  going to have to try to save this.  I am tired of lawyers.  They are screwing up the government, really.  Yeah, now there's just too much, like, sales money in this to just blow it off, because  they're freaking out now.  Hey, man, that's their...  So...  Figure that out.  But the thing is...  We have to figure out our radio show when you chop the shit out of it, so figure it 
[00:39:00]  out.  Do you understand how low on the totem pole of this whole event that the actual homeless  shopping spree on our show is?  Right.  It's become a widget.  It's just something to sell.  It's not an event.  It's not this.  It's a thing to sell to them.  And it can just be replaced by something else.  And to us, no, it can't.  It's got to be done the way we do it.  Right.  And that can't happen, so, you know, where are we? 
[00:39:30]  So this is our impasse that we're at.  Where are we?  Well, that was a pretty big email that was sent out Friday or Saturday morning, whenever  exactly it was sent out, and I haven't heard from anyone since.  That's where we're at.  You would think these guys would be working their asses off all weekend to figure it out,  but there's, you know...  Yeah.  We all know that there's nothing to figure out, and you guys really fucked up.  Not us.  We didn't fuck up.  You fucked up.  All we wanted to do was do what we were doing for years around Christmastime. 
[00:40:00]  Let the homeless shop get the word out.  It gets press.  You know the press that we've, you know, gotten single-handedly from this show alone for what's  happened, and, you know, certain things that end up in the paper, and the name Opie and  Anthony and Sirius XM ends up in the news.  It's things like the homeless shopping spree that do that.  Mm-hmm.  Well, we even got scolded.  We got scolded for getting international attention.  Of course.  You know, things like that.  We got scolded, actually. 
[00:40:30]  No one knew it was from Sirius XM.  They all knew.  They all knew.  I can't even believe I had that conversation, too.  Well, that's the responsibility of marketing to connect Opie and Anthony to Sirius XM, so  if Opie and Anthony get their name out there, people make that association.  Well, they're aware of it now, so let's give them the benefit of the doubt and see how that  pans out.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, whatever.  We just come in here and do great radio.  That's what we do.  We do our jobs.  We grade on everyone.  Oh, it's a joke.  Yeah, but we're difficult. 
[00:41:00]  We're difficult as we're four days away from the homeless shopping spree and we don't have  them all.  But we're difficult, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  Hey, we're going to go to break.  I got to play this creep thing for Jimmy.  I got an idea.  What?  Mind control.  We'll get all the executives and use the harp system on them.  I'm a Navy SEAL.  By the way, I wish he was here right now.  Oswald couldn't have made that shot.  He was a sharpshooter. 
[00:41:30]  I know.  Why didn't anybody like...  Because it was such a...  It was...  Again, I wasn't prepared to argue that position, to be very honest with you.  But I knew that and I didn't want to say it.  You know something and you're like, you just doubt yourself like an asshole.  And I went back and did the research and it's in the Warren Report.  He was...  I forget what he classified as a 212, I think, in 1956.  Is that good?  He was a sharpshooter.  212's good?  Yeah.  And a Marine officer testified to the Warren Commissioner.  All right.  Oswald...  He couldn't make old shots.  He was a terrible shot. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  That would happen.  No, he wasn't.  Just, all right, shut up.  And it has been, by the way, duplicated.  Not only has it been duplicated, people have improved on Oswald's shots.  Yes.  So...  I had more of a problem with the fact that he said there was a tree in the way.  Yeah.  A tree has grown a few...  And it was November.  A few feet in November.  Aren't leaves aren't as prevalent in November as they are in other months?  I think a tree could grow a lot in 30 years.  There's a tree in the way.  40 years at this point.  Have you looked at a picture?  There's a tree in the way.  Wow.  No one's ever shot anyone next to a tree. 
[00:42:30]  Well, he's trying to set me up.  He goes, have you been there?  He didn't think I had been.  I was like, yes.  So have I.  So have I.  What does that mean?  Who cares?  Did you serve?  All right.  Shut up.  Jimmy, I want to play something for you.  When we get back, we're going to do the Tiger Woods shit.  We're going to do your football shit.  I mean, a lot happened over the weekend.  We're going to do the fucking Snooki shit.  Oh, that's another travesty that...  I got a theory on it.  You got the same theory?  Got a theory? 
[00:43:00]  What?  What?  The same theory you do, I think.  This.  Yes.  Yeah.  I'm just thinking...  Finger pie?  It's the same exact situation that we are finding ourselves in.  All right, we're going to...  That's what I...  That's my theory.  Maybe.  That's my theory.  We'll discuss.  Let's read the theory.  That's my theory.  Because then, let's just say...  Dude, I think that would make super outrage.  I'm just thinking.  That would be more exploitive, I think.  No, because then parents can decide if they're... 
[00:43:30]  This is my theory.  All right, let's see.  Opi's theory.  You'll all hear about these theories after the break.  But we write theories.  Yeah, we write our theories down.  Everything is kept on record.  Got it.  Navy seal.  Stop it.  Circus seal.  Hi, I'm Jesse.  I did that with my nose.  I would have to write more to completely explain.  Maybe. 
[00:44:00]  Maybe.  Wow, okay.  I want to hear about that theory.  Uh, as far as...  Here, look.  Oh, oh, oh.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Right, right, right, right.  You got it?  I gotcha.  I gotcha.  Hmm.  You know what I mean?  Well, Mr. Norton, that's very interesting.  Odd and even buses.  We'll explain our theories on why MTV's not going to show the snake. 
[00:44:30]  You were the one that suggested the Costco, Ralph.  You know, I heard you got to jot these lame ideas down.  Jot them down when you hear...  I said bring them to the mall.  You said no.  Have the homeless come to you and just hand them gifts.  That doesn't sound like Norton, but we all know it is Norton.  Me.  Oh, boy.  Jimmy, we're going to play something.  Bring them to a venue.  Well, that's a very interesting idea. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah, you bring them to the venue.  The homeless are there.  People are there.  They're buying a fucking Dio burger at the Hard Rock.  Great.  Sounds fantastic.  Shut up.  Did you hear about mustard, Jimmy?  That's what I'm getting at here for you.  Mustard Rock.  Yes.  You heard about mustard, the homeless guy?  Yeah, yes.  The homeless guy?  Yes.  Okay.  He comes in.  He's one of our homeless guys.  He's a musician.  Fell on bad times. 
[00:45:30]  Comes in here.  We talk to him a little bit.  We find out he's kind of an old musician.  We're like, why don't you play something for us?  So we found him a guitar.  These dopes that are checking out the video, by the way, they're all like, how can he be homeless if he's playing a $3,000 acoustic guitar?  It's because we found him one.  It's Sirius XM.  We have guitars all over the fucking joint, you idiots.  Is the logo on the guitar?  Yeah, it's on the headstock.  Yeah, a tailor's a really good guitar.  Yeah, I know it is.  And Guilty is my own father who goes, well, how do you get that tailor?  I'm like, hey, idiot.  Do you think that's really his guitar? 
[00:46:00]  Like this huge facility here.  Like we don't have a nice guitar.  We have instruments because we have so many people, not us personally, but the Sirius XM has musicians stopping by all the time.  And you better have guitars around just in case they don't bring their own shit.  And not only that, but the quality of the memorabilia that they have all over the walls.  I mean, they have sign tailors that don't get touched with the tag still on them.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Wow.  So that's why Mustard had a $3,000 acoustic guitar.  I mean, just think.  That's all we ask from the average person is to think. 
[00:46:30]  You think if he had a $3,000 guitar on the streets of New York City, it would survive?  No.  The thing was as shiny as could be.  It was a brand new guitar.  Well, what do they do?  I saw a little CNN spot right there that says, like, helping those in need.  Right.  And it looked like some people that might have been homeless.  And I guess they were helped in some charitable way.  Really?  I wonder how many things had to be signed off on.  Really?  How come we can't just help the homeless without a big to-do? 
[00:47:00]  I don't really.  I'm just, I'm disgusted.  I don't really understand because this radio thing is the easiest thing you could do as a career.  It really is.  And they have just made it so complicated.  Oh, my God.  It just amazes me.  So, Mustard, all of a sudden, I go, what are you going to play?  And he goes, don't worry, I got this.  All confident.  And he jams out a version of Radiohead's Creep that everyone is talking about.  Video is doing very, very well.  Go to my YouTube channel, Opie Radio, if you haven't seen the video.  But I want to play it again for Jimmy.  You haven't heard this yet, right? 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, it's good.  I have not, no.  And then his originals are really good.  Yeah.  Really fucking good.  I knew Mustard had, I don't know as much as Anthony when it comes to this music shit.  But I was like, holy crap.  And then I looked at Anthony, and he was blown away.  I was just looking like, holy fuck, this guy's got some great raspy voice that just, it's  really original, you know?  It sounded really good.  Yeah, absolutely.  And his version of Creep.  It's originals.  Huh?  What was one of his originals called?  I don't remember.  Oh, fucking eating out of a dumpster or something. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah, maybe we'll play a few of those later today or something.  Yes.  Although.  Hands full of shit, doo-wah.  Although, this would be another 30-minute discussion.  I've got to write something down.  This is, this is what was told to me recently, too.  What?  Bag-a-dang-dang-a-bag-a-dang-dang-dang, sleep on a rock.  A rock, sleep on a rock. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, more writing.  This was told to me, but this will be another half-hour discussion, so I just want to pass  this one.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, that's, that's interesting.  In any context.  Yes.  Yes.  Why?  It doesn't matter.  It hasn't gotten to me yet, trust me, because that one will just, that will.  I don't, um, well, whatever.  I just don't.  All right, so here's Mustard doing Radiohead's Creep.  And by the way, he had no, no time to practice. 
[00:49:00]  He hasn't even played a guitar in a while.  He just fucking went with it.  Check it out as we go to break.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You just have my, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Am I the only one that downloaded Naina's 99 Luftballons?  Uh, wow.  Did he really download that one?  I just had an urgency.  The German version?  Of course, yeah. 
[00:49:30]  The American version stinks.  I like the German version.  No who stinks?  The Cowboys.  Oh, good segue.  Thank you, Andy.  2017.  Yeah, they, they, they, every year this happens.  They just, I don't think Romo is ever going to win anything.  Well, they're 8-5.  I think it is there.  He's not a big game quarterback.  Fucking Jets, man.  Got a shot at the, the playoffs.  Winning three in a row.  Yeah.  Huh?  They got a little shot at the playoffs.  What's going on there?  And then you got two teams still undefeated.  That's amazing.  13-0.  Dallas has to play them next Saturday, too, New Orleans. 
[00:50:00]  Really?  Jets play the Colts.  I'm looking at a big upset.  I think the Jets take out the Colts.  Bank on it.  You heard it here first.  Oh, no.  Bank on it.  Oh, dude.  Come on, dude.  I haven't been sure.  Drain your bank accounts, people.  I haven't been sure of a game in a long time, and people have been waiting for my, my next  pick.  Bank on it.  Oh, wow.  When Opie says this, you are stupid if you don't take your mortgage money.  Really?  And bet against what Opie has said.  Jets beat the Colts. 
[00:50:30]  Bank on it.  Colts.  Just go Colts all the way.  Bank on it.  I'm telling you.  I'm feeling this one.  Bank on it.  What day is this?  I don't want any trickery.  This is December 14th.  Holy shit.  I'm saying this.  Jets will beat the Colts.  Bank on it.  Let it be known the ONA show just gave away free money.  We just gave our listeners free money.  Bank on it.  You don't need no fucking point spread.  Jets beat the Colts.  All righty.  You heard it here, folks.  Oh, my God. 
[00:51:00]  I am so betting.  I never bet football.  Please bet.  How could I?  I got to.  Please bet.  With the spread or out and out win?  Out and out win.  Jets beat the Colts.  What's the spread?  I don't even know.  I think it's a couple weeks away still, right?  What's the spread?  Marmalade.  Oh.  It always is.  I love marmalade.  Who doesn't?  It's every boy's favorite treat.  Marmalade.  Hey, did you hear Club Sutter Kenny's version of 99 Luft balloons? 
[00:51:30]  Oh, I bet it's better than me.  Travis, we have that later on.  Me, me, me.  Are you all named as German?  Me, me.  Apparently, she released some balloons they thought was a nuke.  Really?  Really?  Walk high and wax him horizon.  Heif man, Führer, UFOs.  Opting them all.  Dad, I'm sick.  I'm flack of staff and have an affin.  Allens and Kevin win.  Daddy won't.  This is what I hear when he talks anyway.  Oh, that's enough. 
[00:52:00]  Sounds like Nuremberg testimony.  Yeah.  From some poor fuck that knows he's being hung.  That's enough.  What do you mean some poor fuck?  They earned their hangs, Ant.  They weren't victims.  I knew someone was going to pick up on that.  Someone.  How about everybody?  Some misunderstood lad.  Some poor fuck.  Some poor son of a gun who just showed up and put Zyklon B in there.  Really?  We have to play the birthday wish for Jimmy.  Did you hear about the latest birthday wish? 
[00:52:30]  I did not.  They yanked it off YouTube, by the way.  Did they?  Oh, yeah.  They're not happy that they're just getting fucking...  They're getting slammed.  It's great.  They're getting beat up.  Did you hear the latest one?  I have not.  Oh, I hope it's there.  We have a collection of these now, but...  It's off YouTube.  How will we watch it?  Oh, really?  Oh, there.  Oh, let's see.  Is that it still?  It should be.  Then maybe it's not off YouTube.  Someone's saying it was off YouTube?  Oh, video.  No longer.  Oh, boy.  Copyright by Quincy Newspapers, Inc.  We'll find it somewhere.  It doesn't matter if YouTube pulls it. 
[00:53:00]  No, it's the same one.  It's the same one that got Uncle Paul and Gregory's 30th.  And they got him again.  And wait till you hear the latest one.  You're not going to believe it.  That's a good one.  Oh, that's a good one.  It was amazing.  Do we not have it saved?  Iraq probably is trying to figure it out down the hall.  And Danny's trying to figure it out here, just in case.  What are these Thailand bitches?  Nothing great.  Come in here and fucking...  Huh?  Thailand bitches are always in this room. 
[00:53:30]  In this little video room.  Thing.  I'll just say.  They're like just popping.  Colts Jets, thank you, is December 27th.  Yeah, we got two weeks.  We got two weeks from that.  That's the one.  No, that's the Connor.  Yeah, that's the one.  Oh, Jimmy never heard this one?  Did you hear the Connor one?  No.  This is great.  It has all the features.  And the kid is just adorable that they're showing here.  A little Connor Peterson is out there. 
[00:54:00]  He's smiling.  And I can't believe they fell for that.  Jimmy the Creep writes, whoever did that is...  So, what happened, Danny?  They only have us talking about it?  Yeah.  All right.  That's apparently...  They'll find it down the hall.  Forget it.  Just forget I said that until we have it.  It is so fucking funny, man.  Just wait to hear this one, Jimmy.  It could be the best one yet, believe it or not.  And remember we had a nice shooting in Times Square last week?  Yes, we did.  You missed a great shooting in Times Square. 
[00:54:30]  I heard a cop shot a panhandler.  Two, three blocks from here.  Low life off the street.  Another one gone.  Goodbye.  Not a panhandler.  Fucking extortionist.  A shakedown artist.  Oh, what was he doing?  That's one of these scams that they do now in Times Square where these guys that are rappers,  they have a CD, which is normally just a blank CD, a blank disc and a jewel case with a home-printed fucking cover and everything.  Yeah, yeah.  I've seen this guy.  They never take this.  And they walk up to you and go...  They walk up to tourists and go, what's your name, man?  What's your name?  And someone will go like, oh, Bob? 
[00:55:00]  And then he'll write to Bob and sign it and go, $10, $10.  Ew.  And then the guy goes, I didn't buy it.  He goes, I signed it, man.  What's the matter?  You don't like music?  You don't like...  And really force the guy to give him $10 for this shit.  So this is the scam this low life was doing.  So the cops' way of combating it is saying, hey, where's your tax stamp?  You know, they ask him for a tax stamp.  And the guy takes off running, so they chase him.  Doubles back down Broadway.  Ends up by about 46th and Broadway. 
[00:55:30]  And pulls out a MAC-10.  Like from...  Old school.  Old school MAC-10.  That's a weapon from the 80s crack epidemic.  Yo, I got my MAC-10.  And two shots fire out of it before it jams.  It's got a 30-round mag.  And let me jump in here.  Oops.  I'm jammed.  I got some info...  I just lit him up.  I got some info yesterday about the shooting for real.  Yeah?  Because I told you, I know someone, that's their beat.  Yeah.  They weren't involved, though.  But the guy went... 
[00:56:00]  You know, the guy went gangster.  And because he went gangster sideways, that's why it jammed.  Yeah, that makes sense.  Yeah.  Shooting sideways?  No, but I'm saying, because we weren't really sure why it jammed.  But that's...  The guy went gangster, went sideways, and that's the only reason why another, what, 25 bullets  to...  I'm sure it wasn't...  Didn't go flying.  I'm sure it wasn't the cleanest gun, either.  Yeah.  And I'm sure he wasn't there oiling and making sure everything...  The parts work smoothly.  A MAC-10.  Yeah, you hold certain guns wrong, and the slide isn't going to work on it. 
[00:56:30]  But that's official.  I mean, the boys I know, they said he...  The only reason is because he went gangster.  If he didn't go gangster, most likely, you know, a hell of a lot more bullets would have  been all over the fucking place.  So, he got two rounds off, and a sergeant just pulled his gun out, boom, one in the  arm, one in the collarbone, and one smack in the chest.  Oh, yeah, Dad.  Good.  Goodbye.  And his rap lyrics were talking about how, like, he feels sorry for the cop that tries  to arrest him and all this... 
[00:57:00]  I don't know.  All this stuff.  And his mama wants justice, because why didn't they just shoot him in the leg?  Oh, shut up.  He pulled out a fucking machine gun?  A machine gun.  Shot out of him in the leg?  Like, what the fuck?  No, no.  He tries.  You got to get the article from Newsday.  Newsday was all over this kid.  Like, you know, he was an aspiring rap artist and all that shit.  Of course they were.  Newsday had a whole article basically praising this guy and not the cops. 
[00:57:30]  They didn't mention the fact they pulled out of Mark 10?  We got to get the articles, just so I don't misrepresent it.  The article was not too kind.  And the picture of him that was in the post was up to him with Reverend Al.  Reverend Al holding up his disc and pointing to it and stuff.  And the guy looking all tough with the gangster face on, like, I can't ever have a good time  because I'm so oppressed.  I can't have a good job.  I have to get a job.  Stop shaking people down in Times Square. 
[00:58:00]  Fucking low life.  Well, he's dead now, so I guess he can't get a job.  Anthony leads to today.  Fuck him.  Satin pillow warmer.  You were reciting lyrics.  Uh-oh.  And the boys did a little something with your lyrics.  You know, right when I was reading that, because I was reading the gentleman's lyrics.  Were they good?  They were terrible.  They didn't make much sense.  They were kind of about, you know, killing cops and shit.  But I knew as I was reading it, I'm like, oh, this is bad.  This is really bad.  Well, this is what the guys did.  It was our own guys. 
[00:58:30]  Did this with your reading of the rap lyrics.  Oh, Troy Kwan?  Produced by Troy Kwan.  I was like, oh.  You shall die.  For sure.  I'm on a mission on Times Square.  Wishing that a cop die before he reach me.  I'll look into that cop's eye before he duck caps. 
[00:59:00]  Better pray for your safety and keep the gun off safety.  The streets done raised me.  Ain't nothing changed.  It's still, fuck you, pay me all else.  Yo.  And funny.  Guns blazing makes me so horny.  Biggest dick in the NYC.  Guns blazing makes me so horny. 
[00:59:30]  It's what's poppin', yo.  You already know.  You already know.  In the middle of Times Square, so multiply that.  These bundles of CDs.  One for ten, two for fifteen, three for twenty.  I sign autograph, and plus you take the picture with me.  Forty seconds.  You got forty seconds, cop.  Yeah, my motherfucking record.  I hustle hard right in front of virgins or the Marriott.  Cops can't stop us.  This is legal profit.  Yo. 
[01:00:00]  For sure.  And funny.  Guns blazing makes me so horny.  Biggest dick in the NYC.  Guns blazing makes me so horny.  It's what's poppin', yo.  You already know.  You already know.  Guns blazing makes me so horny. 
[01:00:30]  Guns blazing.  Did you just say it off mic? 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, a little bit.  All right.  A little off mic, but it's fucking, I was hysterical.  Fucking guy.  Hey, uh, did you hear the E-Rock birthday wish, Jimmy?  I did not, no.  Oh, so you're two behind.  Yeah, he's two behind.  Okay, we found both of them, Danny.  So do the E-Rock one first, which I kind of gave it away, but whatever.  Time to announce the birthdays.  Happy birthday to Marissa.  Happy birthday wishes from mom, dad, Bradley, grandma, Marlene, grandma, and grandpa Ronnie,  and all your aunts, uncles, and cousins. 
[01:01:30]  Happy 21st birthday to Anna Skumakovich.  Birthday wishes from your mom, dad, Stephanie, and Patricia.  And a 10th birthday to Riley.  And second birthday to Maya Slade.  Birthday wishes from mom, dad, Tyson, and Simon.  Happy 2nd birthday to Cole.  Birthday wishes from all your family.  And happy birthday to Eric Nagle.  Birthday wishes from Greg, Tony, Lily, Jimmy, Papa John, and May-Naze.  May-Naze. 
[01:02:00]  May-Naze.  May-Naze is my favorite.  May-Naze.  And then, uh, the same station guy here with this next one.  Listen closely, Jimmy.  This is horrible.  Here we go.  More birthday wishes.  It is birthday time.  It sure is.  Happy 12th birthday to Michelle Toulousey.  Birthday wishes from mom, dad, Melanie, Joey, Casey, and Rascal.  Happy 15th birthday to Derek and Daniel Kobach. 
[01:02:30]  Birthday wishes from mom, dad, and Casey.  Happy 7th birthday to Connor Peterson.  Birthday wishes from your fishing buddies, Lacey and Scott.  Happy 11th birthday.  We're going on to Jordan Hartman's birthday wishes from mom, dad, and dad.  Yes, fishy.  Are you kidding me?  That is so bad.  And there's a little kid, like, just this little smiling kid. 
[01:03:00]  Your fishing buddies, Lacey and Scott.  How do they not pick up on that?  Dummies.  Stupid birthday wishes.  How great is that?  And then they get so mad and get the videos yanked from YouTube after the fact.  Fucking dopes.  Oh, man.  God's to love it.  Anyway.  Yeah.  MTV has decided not to show the Snooki Punch, which is very bizarre because they have shown 
[01:03:30]  the Snooki Punch.  Probably a thousand times they've shown it.  Yeah.  I think everyone has seen it.  Everyone has seen the Snooki Punch from, of course, Jersey Shore.  A lot of people talking about this MTV Jersey Shore show.  Did you see the latest episode yet?  Nope.  With Snooki making out with chicks and stuff?  Oh, she's the best.  I missed that one.  I'll turn on MTV at any moment.  Yeah.  I'm sure it's on right now.  And so MTV, after a lot of pressure, has decided to yank the part of the show where 
[01:04:00]  Snooki gets just fucking rocked by this guy at the bar.  But why?  If it was two guys doing it, they wouldn't yank it.  They shouldn't yank it.  Well, there's a lot of whys.  Why are you yanking it when it's already been out there?  So what damage can be done if it's already been shown?  That guy was so drunk.  And apparently, did you read the article on it?  He's a gym teacher.  Gym teacher in New York.  They said he had been, the article said that he had been drinking and taking their drinks  too.  Of course he's been drinking.  Look at his eyes.  He can't even focus anymore. 
[01:04:30]  As he's turning his head, his eyes stayed like where they were.  Right, right.  But why would MTV pull it if it's already been, it was already out there?  She has some resilient bones.  Because that just looks like it would bust her jaw.  Would it punch in the jaw?  Yeah.  I think the hair flying makes it look like it's worse than it was, maybe.  She gets hit so fucking hard.  Her jaw should be broken then.  I'm surprised guys in her family haven't fucking hunted for this dude.  All right.  Well, who knows what happens behind the scenes, you know? 
[01:05:00]  Yeah.  I'm sure they're not happy about this at all.  Yeah.  Hey.  Jesus.  My theory on this is really simple.  I don't think MTV had any intention of showing this within the episode.  Now that's...  They knew they had gold.  They put it at the end, like this season on Jersey Shore, and you're looking at all these  clips, and the last clip is this, and everyone went, holy shit.  We all did.  Like, whoa!  Yeah.  And I think it was their way of getting the clip out there to promote the show, get people  talking, and then they could save face and go, well, a lot of people are really upset 
[01:05:30]  by this, so we have decided to do the right thing and not show the clip within the episode.  Right.  Right?  Right?  Yeah.  It's an interesting idea.  I don't think they gave it that much forethought.  You don't think so?  I don't think so.  Then why not show it?  Because, like I said, it's already out there.  Because people are by the DVD.  And now Jimmy's idea is you think it's going to be part of the DVD thing.  I think so, sure.  Which I think would infuriate even more, like they're really trying to capitalize on her 
[01:06:00]  getting punched.  Like, that's the whole thing.  It's like, oh, you're using this brutality and putting it on TV, and it's terrible, and  what?  Like, why?  For what?  Then they want to put a domestic violence information thing at the end.  That wasn't domestic violence.  No, exactly.  That's how I'm fucking drunk at a bar clocking a girl.  They don't even know each other.  How is that domestic violence?  That's just a bar fight that happens every weekend across America. 
[01:06:30]  Did people object to them showing the guys fighting?  Huh?  No.  No, no, no.  No, of course not.  No, no.  Of course not.  So, I don't know.  MTV, I guess, caved.  I'm suspicious with this whole thing, man.  I think they knew that they just could not show this within the episode itself.  Years ago, I would agree with you.  In this day and age, with all the shit that's going on, like we were just talking about with  the homeless shopping, the lawyers and shit, I absolutely think this is exactly what it 
[01:07:00]  is.  They thought they could do it?  They got the pressure, and yeah, that would have been, you know, if they were-  And they folded to the pressure?  They promo, promo, promo, and then when the episode comes up, they promo it again, and everyone's  going to tune in to see why that happened, how it happened, and now they're not going  to show it, my- I don't really understand, because it happens to us- I won't bitch about  the company, but I will say one thing.  Like, when we do some controversial shit, all of a sudden, like, these people scramble  around and yank it from, like, a replay or something, and my thought is, well, it's 
[01:07:30]  too late.  It's already out there, so what good does that do?  You might as well keep it in there, you know.  Yeah.  So, in MTV's case, if the clip has already been out there, what are you preventing?  People have already seen it.  And it's a, you know, supposed to be a reality show, and that's what happened, so show the  fucking thing.  Right.  It's part of the storyline of what happened.  Why does TV have to be goody-two-shoes all of a sudden?  Yeah, we gotta learn from it and reflect. 
[01:08:00]  Like, people outraged that they even have this show on TV.  Why?  They're real people.  They casted real people for this show.  It's not an SNL skit where they're completely going over the top with stereotypes and making  fun of Italians.  These are real fucking people, and this is how they act.  People act like this, just they're videotaping it.  So why, as adults especially, we can't see this on our TV?  Don't show it, and then maybe people won't think it exists.  Here we go.  An exclusive, for real.  We got the situation on the phone.  Damn.  Hey, situation! 
[01:08:30]  The situation.  What's up, sir?  What's up, guys?  How you doing?  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show, my friend.  I hear you sort of know about us, or is that bullshit?  No, no, no.  I'm definitely a big fan of you guys, definitely.  I appreciate that.  We're just talking about the Snooki punch and how MTV, you know, decided to yank it from  the actual episode.  You know what?  That's definitely an unfortunate incident, and life's not perfect.  Stuff like that does happen.  It was nobody of the cast that was, you know, really, you know, hit her in any way, but it 
[01:09:00]  was just some random guy.  He had a little bit too much to drink, and, you know, he just made a bad decision.  Now, as per it being yanked, I would just maybe say that maybe as respect to her and  her family, they just wanted to take it up, possibly.  Yeah, but that's kind of silly, because, I mean, everyone has seen the clip now, man.  It's been on everywhere.  I mean, it is everywhere.  The clip went viral.  MTV showed it a ton of times as, you know, a preview clip of what to expect from this fine 
[01:09:30]  show of yours there.  By the way, we're all big fans of Jersey Shore.  We love it.  He's been saying we like the show a lot.  Yeah, we love it.  Is there anything, like, are you cool with the way they cut it up?  Because a lot of people, when they do a reality show, are not happy with the final product.  But when you watch that, are you cool?  Like, you're like, that was, okay, that's pretty much how I wanted to be represented,  or did they screw you over?  No, no, no, not at all.  I mean, I live life moment by moment, which I'm sure you guys can see. 
[01:10:00]  And whatever you see is what you get.  We had a blast doing it, and I had an awesome experience with MTV and the whole situation.  Yeah.  Hey, getting back to that clip really fast, Snooki was in that dude's face, so what was  going on?  Because they obviously didn't know each other.  Oh, you know what?  That airs in probably like two, three days, Thursday and 10th.  I really can't give too much away.  But it happens, you know, just a bunch of young 20-somethings going out, and somebody made 
[01:10:30]  a bad, bad decision, and, you know, like I said, it's an unfortunate incident.  You know what it is?  This stuff does happen all the time, and the reality show should be real.  I mean, now if it's what you said, like out of respect for her and her family and stuff  like that, all right, that's harder to argue than just saying, you know, pulling it for  being under pressure by sponsors or certain interest groups and stuff like that. 
[01:11:00]  But I say just leave it in, man, you know?  Yeah, we can handle it.  It's real.  We can handle reality TV, believe it or not.  Hey, how do you feel about all the people protesting about the show?  Well, you know what, you're going to get a lot of people that, you know, love you and hate  you, so you really can't please everybody.  It's definitely real.  Everything you see is real, and if you really don't like it that much, you possibly could  change the channel.  But as far as I know, over, you know, two million people, you know, viewed in last week, so, 
[01:11:30]  and, you know, possibly even more this week.  Are you surprised at the success of the show?  Oh, to be honest with you, I'm a pretty, you know, confident kid, and I was pretty excited.  I knew the show was going to be good, and I had a very good feeling once I left the show  because there was, you know, a lot of action and, you know, the whole season, but I did 
[01:12:00]  not believe that we would take reality by storm in about seven days, which is pretty crazy.  Yeah.  What do you do for your abs?  It's really depressing to watch you on television.  My abs are not quite up to par.  You know what?  I've always had a six-pack since I was little, you know, and ever since I started working out,  I just got a muscle.  I had a six-pack, and then, you know, you actually know the recipe to get into unbelievable shape,  and that's how you just watch the diet and cardio, obviously nutrition. 
[01:12:30]  It's like the, like I told you before, the...  You're one of those lucky kids that have genetics on your side.  And banging broads.  Banging the broads.  That's the situation.  Well, we all love the show.  We're completely hooked, talking about it a lot on our radio show here.  Yeah.  Do you talk to anybody else from the show since it wrapped up?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I'm actually best friends with DJ Pauly D. 
[01:13:00]  We're out here in L.A. right now, you know, just having fun.  We've got a lot of things out here, you know, having fun,  and at the same time a little bit of work, too.  As well as I do speak to Snooki, and I speak to everybody,  but everybody, you know, has their relationship.  Who's closer?  Who's best friends?  How does L.A. treat, like, Jersey guidos?  You know what?  I'm very honest.  I feel like an endangered species at a petting zoo out here. 
[01:13:30]  I don't doubt it.  Not many out there, man.  It's a little different than Jersey.  We went out here, and people are just flipping.  They actually love us out here, and we love L.A.,  so I think we're out here for another day or two.  But we went out, I think, a day or two ago, or two days ago,  and people were just chasing us, and it was pretty wild.  Yeah, Sam's got a question for you, Mike.  Situation, this is, like, the biggest breakout MTV has had in a long time. 
[01:14:00]  You guys are killing TMZ right now in L.A.  As the breakout star of the show,  how individually responsible do you think you are for the success of it?  That's a brilliant question.  Good question.  Yeah.  You know what?  I'm just being myself, and if the show is successful because of that,  I'm happy, and I guess that's all I've got to say about that.  I'm just being myself, having fun.  I live life moment by moment, so at any particular time, you will get a situation. 
[01:14:30]  Do you feel like you've gotten the most, like,  it seems like a lot of the attention has been on you as far as the guys are concerned,  because you really do seem to be the one that just kind of goes out fearless to live life.  Not that the other guys aren't, but you seem to be really the above-and-beyond guy who will do that.  You know what?  I've always been like that.  You know, you only live once, definitely.  Live once.  You know, I'm in my 20s, and, you know, I just, like I said,  don't want to have any regrets once I get older, 
[01:15:00]  and I'm sure if I do make any mistakes, I make them now so that I learn from them and grow, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah, we can all learn from you, Mike.  I don't even know the names of the other characters on the show.  It's all about the situation.  I don't even know who Mike is.  I know who the situation is.  Well, we understand that.  Have you ever had any problems how Italians are portrayed on TV, on any show?  No, not that I know of.  I've never had any problem with anything. 
[01:15:30]  I mean, me personally, I don't point the finger at anything.  If I don't like something on TV, I'll probably change the channel,  and I wouldn't even say anything to anybody.  It's got to be because of your confidence, Mike.  You don't care what people are saying about you.  Screw it.  I really don't care too much.  At the end of the day, I have my family.  I have my friends.  It looks like I've got a lot of fans out there.  So when I wake up in the morning, I look in the mirror and I smile,  and I just realize that, hey, today's going to be a good day.  Is there a workout tape in your future, the situation? 
[01:16:00]  Maybe like a little crunch tape or something?  There might be a workout tape.  Recently, I had some sponsors try to sell some ad space on my stomach.  I mean, it's getting pretty wild out there.  I've had the same thing, but for different reasons.  I mean, yeah, they wanted to, you know, people try to put things on my stomach,  and I'm hearing, like, rap songs.  I mean, things are just coming out of the woodwork.  It gets crazier and crazier every day. 
[01:16:30]  And don't get me wrong, I love it.  It's just that I didn't really expect it to blow up in seven days like this.  Yeah, how tall is Snooki, for real?  Snooks is like, she might even be like 4'9", I think.  Yeah, she's not 5'5".  And the last episode, you were making out with Snooki a little bit.  Well, you know what, me and Snooks, we have very, very similar outlooks on having fun  and just living life up.  And, you know, I know she kind of lives life moment to moment. 
[01:17:00]  She's trying to have fun, and I kind of live the same way.  So, you know, we cross the house a couple days in.  Yeah, I hear you.  How jealous, when Ronnie, like, when the whole drama was going on between Ronnie and you and Sammy,  how jealous was Ronnie?  Sammy, Sammy Sweetheart.  Yeah, Sammy Sweetheart.  How jealous was Ronnie getting that he didn't have the gift of gab like you do?  Because he's like a big, beefy guy, but he can't, he doesn't have the game that the situation does, 
[01:17:30]  the way he talks.  Oh, no, you know what, I didn't even expect, you know, exactly what happened,  the whole Ronnie and Sammy situation right there.  Yeah, because, I mean, you could just tell when somebody can talk and somebody can't.  Right.  Or somebody's got it and they don't.  Yeah, the situation is you could talk.  I didn't think that he had it in any way.  Yeah.  And, you know, even though that I was a little wild in the first couple episodes  and jacuzzis or whatever and clubs and stuff like that, me and Sam, we were vibing,  but at the same time, that doesn't give me permission to just be blatantly, you know, 
[01:18:00]  blatantly crazy.  So that kind of changed her mind maybe to get back at me.  She had, you know, went into Ronnie's arms, so it's almost like I handed, you know,  Sam to Ronnie on a silver plate.  Yeah, it just shows you how clueless, you know, sweetheart Sammy there is because, you  know, she should have went for the situation over Ronnie.  We all know that.  Everyone saw that one.  She probably would have had a way better time, you know, the first day or two.  Yeah.  All on.  You hear that, yo? 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  Thanks, fellas.  Yeah.  All right, you're going to be on Jay Leno tonight?  Yeah, yeah.  Like I said, I was actually getting a little sleep, and then I heard about the opening  anthem thing, and I was like, yeah, I definitely got to wake up for that.  And then we got Leno and Access Hollywood and you name it, a lot of stuff going on.  How many guys are doing Leno?  I believe just, like, me, Snooks, maybe, and Pauly, possibly. 
[01:19:00]  All right.  Hey, when Leno asked to see your abs, could you maybe have Opie and Anthony on your abs  when you show it to the national audience?  Yeah, you know, yeah, that's exactly what a couple people had approached me about.  That's exactly what a couple people, and, you know, it's pretty wild, but I don't think  he's going to ask to see my abs, even though almost everybody does.  Now, Leno loves a fucking well-built gentleman.  Yes, and Leno loves abs.  He sure does.  He's all about abs.  I mean, I seen Tyson over the weekend at the Spike Award, and it was pretty cool. 
[01:19:30]  I've been just having a blast.  Well, what happened with you and Tyson?  Anything?  Oh, Tyson's the man.  I love Tyson.  He pulled me aside, and he just gave me some words of wisdom from Tyson.  Oh, that's good.  I can't really say too much of that stuff right now, but I love Mike Tyson.  Did he punch Snooki?  That would have been something.  She could take a punch, that girl.  Yeah, let's see if she could take a real punch, right?  That big meat fist.  Yeah, Mike was definitely a cool guy.  The Situation in Paulie D. had a very good quote, as far as philosophy goes, on TMZ, because  there were a bunch of people in L.A. heckling them on the street, and they pretty much summed 
[01:20:00]  it up when they said, they hate because they ain't.  Oh, I like that.  I mean, they hate because they ain't.  That could be a t-shirt.  You know, you really can't imitate the East Coast attitude, or I guess if you'd say swag.  So when we go out, man, you know, people are flipping out and chasing us and taking pictures,  and like I said, we're so nice to everybody.  But then again, you can't please everybody, and you will get that hater or something.  All right, we get it. 
[01:20:30]  You're great.  You're like the Swatheed Beatles.  Right.  Yeah, you know, you just got to let them know, man.  If you don't like me, just tell your girl to t-bone me real quick.  Oh, damn.  Oh, shit.  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  The Situation, you're great.  We all know it.  Good luck tonight, man.  Have fun on out tonight.  All right, brother?  Cool, man.  Thank you so much, guys.  Love you guys.  All right, bro.  There goes the Situation.  Fucking Blue Heeler from Kentucky.  This interview is embarrassing.  Don't you get what we're doing there, you asshole?  Sam is such an asshole.  Why?  You know, when you said... 
[01:21:00]  It's true, though.  They hate because they ain't.  That's why they hate.  Sam is just such a fucking encouraging ass.  Just trying to get him to say shit.  I encourage the people I love.  You know what I'm saying?  That was fucking funny.  I got to pee.  Yeah, that was cool.  That was a nice exclusive.  We had to go around publicist to get that done.  We said, fuck the publicist.  We'll just call the guy personally.  And that's how it works.  And he said, fuck yeah, I'll go on your show.  So very cool.  Yeah, he was cool, man.  We'll go around management.  It works well.  Absolutely.  We'll be back.  Stay there. 
[01:21:30]  Opie and Anthony, it's a Monday.  What is this?  This sounds like something like from the early 90s, late 80s.  That's the Spaceman by the Killers.  How old is this?  A year.  Okay.  Then it's like a...  You like the Killers, Jimmy?  I've done two shows with them.  I did one and then met them with you guys. 
[01:22:00]  I don't know.  We were on Leno with the Killers.  Remember that?  Yeah.  A couple years ago.  All right.  Killers rule.  They're good, right?  Oh, yeah.  What kind of music would you say they are?  What would they class the players?  Rock.  Alternative?  No.  What's alternative at this point?  Alternative now is like...  Yeah.  Do well.  Definitely rock.  Alternative.  The rock is dead.  Gone.  Are they big, the Killers?  A little bit, Jimmy.  A little bit.  How many are?  They're huge.  Killers are huge.  Uh, remember that, uh, Connor Peterson clip we just played? 
[01:22:30]  How could we forget?  We gotta go backwards because there's a, uh, conservative, uh, talk show in San Francisco  and Sacramento that discussed the Connor Peterson birthday wish that one of our listeners did  for this fine radio show of ours.  Really?  Wow.  So let's play the original clip again.  Mm-hmm.  And then we'll see what these, uh, conservative, uh, douchebags said about us.  So first, the clip.  Was this just an excuse to play the clip again? 
[01:23:00]  Yes.  Travis?  You want the whole thing or just the whole thing?  No, yeah, from the beginning, from two hours ago.  Shit, man.  Sorry.  Oh, Travis is panicking.  Oh, Travis is losing it.  You should play the, the killers yourself already.  I'm just gonna play the clip.  Your Canadians are going down.  You know that, Travis, right?  Yeah, sure they are.  All right, we'll see what happens this coming Saturday, right?  Sure will.  Yeah, we'll see.  All right, let's go.  Here's the Connor Peterson clip. 
[01:23:30]  Happy seventh birthday to Connor Peterson.  Birthday wishes from your fishing buddies, Lacey and Scott.  Happy 11th birthday.  You're going out to Jordan Hartman.  I think it's hysterical.  It's great.  It's funny.  It's so bad.  It's in such, like, poor taste.  We get all that, but it's funny, man.  But come on.  It's shocking.  Right.  Sometimes shocking is like, holy shit.  Yeah, it got a lot of people laughing.  So Armstrong and Getty had a problem with that clip. 
[01:24:00]  What is Armstrong and Getty?  Who?  Armstrong and Getty.  They sound like people who, like, know Dick Cheney and are doing stuff in Iraq.  Yeah.  Armstrong and Getty.  A contractor from Armstrong and Getty was beheaded.  The law firm of Armstrong and Getty.  Armstrong and Getty.  What are you going there for, like, get your arms big and buy gas?  You get your child out of the water.  You have enough to worry about.  Armstrong and Getty.  Armstrong, yeah.  Hey, big leg strong, too. 
[01:24:30]  I'm...  Boo!  Boo!  You know, like, it's funny, my girlfriend hates him, too.  Oh, really?  Oh.  We'll go back to him later.  All right, good.  We will.  All right, here's Armstrong and Getty.  They comment on the Connor Peterson call.  Uh-huh.  Let's see a picture of them, by the way, Danny, if you can find.  Oh, my God.  What?  Somebody should have...  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Somebody should have... 
[01:25:00]  Here's the radio voice guy.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Somebody should have...  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  And Bunt.  Relax, guys.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, let's relax a little bit.  That is right.  Fucking another...  Simmer down, Cal Ripken.  Another radio show that doesn't use their own voices.  Jesus.  Fucking...  Oh, my God.  What?  Somebody should have...  Does anybody read ahead or proofread these things?  I'm walking into the room, and everybody's going nuts, and nobody will tell me what's happening here. 
[01:25:30]  You've seen this sort of thing on a lot of local TV stations.  It's just a little, you know, they just mention people's birthdays.  People write in with them.  Somebody's got...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It goes something like this.  There is happy 12th birthday to Michelle Toulousey.  Birthday wishes from Mom, Dad, Melanie, Joey, Casey, and Rascal.  Happy 15th birthday to Derek and Daniel Kobach.  Birthday wishes from Mom, Dad, and Casey.  Happy 7th birthday to Connor Peterson.  Birthday wishes from your fishing buddies, Lacey and Scott. 
[01:26:00]  Now, right there, if you're playing that on a radio show, there should be a laugh right there.  We're going to see how they deal with this.  Which one is which?  Oh, my God.  Which one is John Locke?  But wait, they just...  Why would they play it again instead of just saying...  Yes.  It was a birthday...  We all know what birthday wishes are.  Right.  And somebody threw in the name of Connor Peterson, which I think...  And then comment on it.  In a very...  Why do you play it?  Because when they play it, it's okay.  Isn't it outrageous all over again because you're playing the clip? 
[01:26:30]  Yes.  You're getting a reaction out of it.  I love the news.  That's how they do it.  Like the Janet Jackson and all that.  They replay the clip, but it's okay.  There's no outrage when they do it for some reason.  Or the I Miss clip.  No outrage when the news plays the clip.  A morbid laugh, but they just did a story on Hit and Run, and then the camera just panned  out to an empty shoe in the street.  That's true.  Exactly.  Should have been Hit and Stay Still.  That's true.  I ain't going anywhere.  You always get knocked out of your goddamn shoes. 
[01:27:00]  I know.  I want to invent shoes, by the way, that wrap around the top of your ankle and loop around  like Romans.  But then again, I wouldn't be inventing them if they're already there.  Yeah, they're called Roman shoes.  Yeah, they had a Hit and Run, and she caught a whole thing in a Hit and Drive.  The stupid broads out there, that's their hottest shoe right now, is the Roman look.  I like that look, actually.  So here's...  Vomitorium.  War helmet.  No, I don't like balls in my face and a dick on my nose.  When that happens, I just go like this, until the penis tickles and he pulls it away. 
[01:27:30]  That's how you get someone to stop Roman war helmet-ing you.  I hate that.  Look how far you have to go down before you actually find a sexual Roman war helmet.  They're showing actual Roman war helmets on Google.  Stupid.  You've got to put Roman war helmet cock.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, put onion-y.  Where is it?  Wow, you can't find a Roman war helmet picture.  What the hell's wrong with Google?  You sure you don't have your settings on safe? 
[01:28:00]  It should be the number one.  That should be the number one picture that pops up.  Your settings on sexy.  All right, let's see how Armstrong and Getty handle this.  Wow.  God, I love...  Seventh birthday to Connor Peterson.  Birthday wishes from your fishing buddies, Lacey and Scott.  Happy 11th birthday.  Here, going up...  Holy crap.  Oh, my God.  Holy crap.  Or at least I laughed.  What the...  You can't air that.  When did that happen?  You can't...  Wait, you can't air that, but you can? 
[01:28:30]  We can.  Yeah, let's get into that a little bit.  What do you...  You shouldn't air it then if that's how you feel.  And the guy laughed.  Dude, the guy's laughing his ass off.  Yeah, all right.  You can't air that.  When did that happen?  You can't air...  Did anybody read that?  Oh, jeez.  That's in the worst taste ever.  Oh, for God.  Ever.  I'm not laughing.  I'm...  Oh, yeah.  Cringe-extailing.  Yeah, and it's not funny-funny.  It's just...  It's shocking.  Oh, my God.  How did nobody catch that? 
[01:29:00]  Jeez, we laughed.  How did that air?  How did nobody catch that?  I don't know.  I'll have you to verify where that aired.  I'm not sure.  Oh, my God.  That's awful.  Say that again.  That's the worst outrage I've ever heard.  That was...  I don't even know what that was.  That guy laughed.  He got caught out there laughing.  Yeah.  And it's like, you know you played it just to be shocking.  You could have relayed the story by saying it.  Then he even said everything I said.  It's not funny-funny.  It's funny where you're shocked and like, oh, my God, that actually got on. 
[01:29:30]  And it...  So you could say you were laughing, but then he's like, oh, no, I wasn't laughing.  That was cringe-exhaling.  Cringe-exhaling.  Also, that's a laugh, by the way.  Yeah, exactly.  And then I was inhaling, and exhaling again while I shook.  That would be a laugh, stupid.  He didn't...  He said he's not laughing, yet he physically described a laugh.  A laugh.  What is a cringe-exhale?  What is a cringe-exhale?  I have no idea.  A laugh.  I was laughing.  What, uh... 
[01:30:00]  There's a part two here.  Oh, is there?  Good.  I like the way Scott said verified instead of find out, because it sounds more switched to  get you.  Like he's Jack Bowman, CTU.  Is that a cringe-exhale?  It's a cringe laugh.  Why?  It's pretty genuine.  Yeah.  It's how people...  Can you replay that?  Because right before that, there's more of the horrible cartoon laugh. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I like the way Scott said verified instead of find out, because it sounds more switched to  get you.  Like he's Jack Bowman, CTU.  Welcome to the Armstrong and the Getty Showing Bodies.  Oh, jeez.  That's just bad.  Oh, that's terrible.  It's terrible.  It's terrible.  How did nobody catch that?  The unborn child's name.  But how did nobody catch that?  They have absolutely nothing to say about this.  No, no, no.  That's the worst outrage ever.  They don't know what to do with this. 
[01:31:00]  They have a thesaurus.  That's bad.  Terrible.  Awful.  Not good.  Horrendous.  Horrendous.  Abysmal.  Offensive.  Remarkably.  Then they just put adjectives in front of the words.  That's extremely bad.  That's extremely terrible.  That's monumentally bad.  Monumentally terrible.  Stop with the adjectives.  You know why?  They're not outraged, so they can't even fake it.  First they're not.  No.  They played it.  But how did nobody catch that?  It's terrible.  From the person who typed it into the teleprompter, the person who wrote it down to the person who 
[01:31:30]  typed it down, and then the anchor, I think I'd have caught that as I was reading  it and stopped.  Well, what's the IQ of your average low-level TV reporter?  Eight.  In your experience.  Eight.  Is that a cringe exhale?  I believe it aired in Wisconsin, so not locally.  Okay.  So it was.  It's not as.  What?  Who the hell thinks that's a funny joke then?  No, that's awful.  What are you doing in Wisconsin?  What's the matter with you Wisconsinites?  Oh. 
[01:32:00]  Cheese-eating, frost-scraping, snowmobiling dummies.  Brett Favre missing.  Brett Favre!  Favre missing.  That's rough.  Minnesota envying.  Wow.  I fucking hate this business.  Anybody that doesn't appreciate this radio show can go and kill yourself.  Oh my God.  Even if you do.  It really.  Wow.  That show is terrible.  It's extremely horrible.  Really bad. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  Can he get his voice any higher?  Someone said that.  Okay, fuck it.  What's next?  Some guy said that it sounds like two guys doing a chick show.  Yeah.  Like with that outrage.  That false outrage.  Oh no.  And they have nothing to say about it really?  They had nothing to say.  Why were you outraged so much?  Was it the fact that the dead child outraged at the anchor?  Outraged at whoever sent it in? 
[01:33:00]  Where's the outrage?  Elaborate.  Thank you.  I found a cool little video clip I have to bring in.  I think they just wanted to play the clip.  Of course they did.  Oh.  It's a...  What do you got to get around for there?  No, it's not here.  We were signing in Boston.  A couple years ago.  I'll bring it tomorrow.  It's very short.  Oh.  What?  We were fucking with people writing awful stuff.  Oh, the awful things we were writing.  Yeah, those were the days.  I remember that.  When we used to go places.  Oh. 
[01:33:30]  They're going to send this shit anywhere now.  Please.  It costs money.  I don't know.  They want us to do glorified bar gigs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They just wanted to play that clip, but they can't just say,  wow, look at...  We found this.  It's really funny.  Yeah, check this out.  They have to make believe they're outraged or they won't be able to play that clip.  And even do it under the guise of, like, how stupid could the news be,  which they touched on, definitely.  Sure.  But you don't have to preface it by being so outraged.  Correct.  You can just play it and go, holy shit. 
[01:34:00]  Correct.  And then talk about how stupid the news is for letting that one slide by.  You think the person that does the screening is really going to be under the gun now to...  Of course.  ...to look for these things?  People are going to have to get a lot smarter.  Whoever's doing this might have to switch local news channels.  I would just really step up the cleverness of what you're doing.  Oh, yeah.  That's good.  Yeah, because now there's a challenge there to get another one through.  You're not getting mayonnaise.  They're on to you.  Whoever that...  We don't even want to know who the guy is.  He's out there.  He's a fan of our show.  Obviously, that was one of our fans. 
[01:34:30]  They're on to you, buddy.  Mayonnaise, again.  You are never getting a mayonnaise.  No.  A Hey, Would You Blow Me.  You're not going to see his birthday popping up there.  A Phil McCracken.  You won't be seeing that.  I think they're going to start really paying attention.  So, get clever.  Get clever.  I bet you the fan is up for the challenge, though.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  I can't wait.  Oh, yeah.  I can't wait for the next one.  I want to hear it.  By the way, you missed me.  I'm 57 years young.  Yes, they screwed that up, Uncle Paul. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, tragic.  That was terrible.  It was awful they did that.  It was horrible.  Horrendous.  Terrifically horrid.  Tremendously awful.  Yeah.  Let's do your Tiger Woods update.  Okay.  What do you do?  Make that mouth...  That chick must hate that, man.  It just fucking hates Chip.  Of course.  Tiger Woods.  What do you do?  Tiger Woods.  Should we...  I want to wake up Tiger again today.  Do we want to wake up Tiger, or do you want to just do bullet points today? 
[01:35:30]  I want to wake him up later, tomorrow, or something.  You don't feel like waking him up today?  I don't blame you.  We wake him up every day.  I love when we wake up Tiger.  Well, we got Jamie Jungers.  Ah, that's my favorite.  Well, my second favorite now.  Despicable.  I like the other one.  You see the other one that came out in the paper today?  No.  Today?  Another one?  But she's saying that she just went on dates with Tiger and didn't do anything with him.  Bullshit.  And then she...  Low blow.  That's a great deal.  Why would Jamie Jung...  Why would she say that, though? 
[01:36:00]  Like, what a fucking pig to come out and say that.  Because they all want to be famous now.  Holy shit.  This is their chance to be famous.  That's why.  Oh, fuck a duck.  Read the caption, because she swears that she went on dates with Tiger and nothing happened,  but Tiger bought her stuff.  Playboy model.  Laura Dana Jolie.  That's that chick, Laura Dana, yeah.  Which one is she?  That's the hot one that I was...  That we were talking about the other day.  But they said it was an escort?  Yeah.  Claimed through a lawyer yesterday that she had sexless dates with Tiger, and he gave her 
[01:36:30]  cash and jewels.  This is the 15 grand bitch.  Oh, that's the blonde version of her?  I guess so.  Now I'm confused.  What's that?  Laura Dana, right?  There was a madam that came out and said that Tiger paid 15 Gs for this girl.  15 large.  15 large.  I think.  But there's so many girls now, I think we're getting...  Even we're getting a little confused.  15 Gs.  Wow, Tiger.  Is that the same girl, Danny, from...  It is.  Okay.  You're right, Ant.  Yeah.  She looks completely different with blonde hair, no? 
[01:37:00]  Totally, yeah.  Well, the picture they had in the paper, she had brunette.  Yeah, she had dark hair and she had all her clothes on.  The picture they have in the paper today, she's blonde and with barely anything on.  Tiger, wow.  Now he's losing his sponsorships.  Yeah, he lost some.  We knew that was...  He lost Gatorade, but they technically said that they were moving on before the scandal hit.  This one's Procter & Gamble, isn't it?  Which was not a surprise.  He lost Gillette and he's losing this...  What is it called?  Accenture?  Accenture, yeah.  Because they're calling it the first sponsor to drop Tiger.  Gillette phasing him out of ads. 
[01:37:30]  AT&T re-evaluating their relationship.  From Accenture alone, Tiger was making between $10 and $15 million a year.  He just lost between $10 and $15 million a year.  That's a lot of money to fucking just not be getting, no matter how rich you are.  Yeah, dude, that's a tremendous...  That's a hit.  And I'd say this, though.  At least it's coming at him from all ways.  At least he can't just look and go, that one fucking bitch.  It's like, it really is, it's all coming out.  So it's almost like, I think that's easier in the long run because then there's going 
[01:38:00]  to be none that can come after you.  Now it's like, imagine a year from now if this one came out.  Now everyone's just throwing up.  It's going to be out.  It'll be done.  I agree with you, but we're not done yet.  No, no, no.  I mean, in this process, it's still happening.  There are people out there that they're, I bet you they're debating, well, should I  make this public when I know?  I'm telling you, I don't think we're done yet.  They're getting less...  We're getting close.  Less and less.  I say we're about 75, 80% done. 
[01:38:30]  I think there's a couple more bombshells that'll come out in the next week or two.  And then finally he'll know what he's dealing with officially.  So let's say it's 20 chicks, 25 chicks.  The guy's the highest profile.  I don't blame his wife for leaving, but just the way the news and everyone's shocked.  He's not the guy we thought he was.  He's a straight guy with a dick.  That's a guy.  He's a multi-million dollar athlete that is extremely good at what he does.  And he's running around like a single dude.  That's all.  That's all.  If he comes out and says he's a sex addict, I'm going to fucking puke. 
[01:39:00]  I won't.  If he's got to do something to make a million dollars a year back, he can say what he wants.  Who the fuck's believing that?  He's just doing what single athletes do.  And some married athletes, obviously.  But mostly single athletes do exactly what Tiger does.  Hangs down in the VIP lounges with a lot of broads, partying, and seeing what he can get.  Can I say, though, he might be a sex addict because of the risks he took?  Think of it like there's an addictive way to look at this because he was fucking without a condom and doing really high-risk stuff. 
[01:39:30]  He's a billion-dollar athlete fucking without a condom.  Dude, if you...  I get it.  Yeah.  But, I mean, that's addictive shit, man.  You might have turned me around on that.  If you look at everything to try to assess if you're an addict, is it affecting your work?  Is it affecting your home life?  Wait a minute.  It didn't affect his work, unless maybe he was supposed to be better than he is.  Maybe some of those slumps he was in.  But it's affecting his work now. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, yeah.  That's for sure.  Why would he quit golf?  That was the only thing he was doing right.  Because his wife told him to.  But that was the only thing he was doing right.  Hey, are there 20 questions you could bring up?  That was the only stable thing he was doing.  20 questions if you're a sex addict.  There's got to be 20 questions.  Sure.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, let's run down the bullet points fast.  So Tiger announces he's taking an indefinite break from golf to work on being a better husband and father.  That's bullshit.  And he'll be back within a year.  Easy.  If not sooner.  If not sooner.  The Masters are in April.  Come on.  What else is he going to do but hit golf balls for the next few months? 
[01:40:30]  He can't go out in public.  He can't bang bras.  He can't do nothing.  Here it is.  Yeah.  Sex addict quiz.  Now get your pencils, people.  I want everybody.  There's going to be a lot of listeners depressed today.  A lot of listeners.  But there's only nine questions?  Nine.  You think there's 20?  But I guess we'll try nine.  Nine's good.  You got a pen?  I want to take this.  I got one here.  All right.  Thank you.  Oh, yeah.  We could all take it together and then we can guess it what Tiger's thoughts were.  Yes.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  Have you, number one through nine, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. 
[01:41:00]  Here we go.  Have you engaged in sexual behaviors that you wish you could stop?  No.  Well, don't say it.  Just write it.  Who would say yes to that?  I would.  Well, Jimmy probably would say yes to that.  Absolutely.  And I'm going to guess.  Can I guess the time we have to guess what Tiger would say?  I'm going to guess yes, because he probably wishes that he didn't need to do ambient or 
[01:41:30]  wasn't.  If that's what he was doing, he's probably like, fuck, man, why can't I just be faithful  and not take these risks?  You have to be fucking panicking that you're doing this crazy shit.  He's not a dumb guy.  He's a really smart dude.  So my guess for him would be yes.  Tiger, I'll say yes.  Okay.  I'm going to do me and then Tiger.  I'll do the same.  Okay.  Do you feel abnormally driven by your sex drive?  No.  Abnormally driven by your sex drive. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Good.  I have an absolutely yes.  Yes on that too, Jimmy.  Oh, dude.  And Tiger, yes, right?  I don't know.  I put don't know.  I don't know.  He may just feel comfortable doing that.  He may just be a guy with a high drive.  I don't know what his thoughts are.  Have you been in relationships just for sex?  Yes.  The question is, have you ever been in one that didn't have anything to do with that?  But how is that part of the sex addiction quiz?  Every fucking human being has been in a relationship for just the sex.  Piece of the puzzle. 
[01:42:30]  It lasted a couple weeks.  Just a piece of the puzzle.  Get the fuck out of here.  Piece of the puzzle.  It's horse shit.  Because that one, almost every human being would have to say yes to.  Okay.  Why have you masturbated, has it been going on even after marriage or relationship?  Oh, yeah, if you're in a heavy relationship.  That's bullshit too.  Oh, my God.  Listen.  That one might be.  Wait, hold on.  That's bullshit.  Why?  Just about every human being would say yes to that question too.  Almost.  See, you said almost every human being. 
[01:43:00]  So maybe somebody.  Come on.  How is that a sex addiction question?  Piece of the puzzle.  Well, again, it won't be.  It's okay if you're in a relationship where you're married and you masturbate.  It's okay.  It's subtle.  It's not going to be.  Do you stick your head fucking dick in glory holes every night?  I understand all that.  That's question six, by the way.  Number five, we're up to.  Have you continued to use pornography after entering a long-term committed sexual relationship?  I don't want to take the quiz anymore.  I do.  It's not.  It's bullshit. 
[01:43:30]  Everyone would say yes to that too.  But again, if you've done a couple of things.  But Jimmy, we're already up to three questions.  I like 20 questions.  I like 20 questions.  We're up to three questions that I strongly would say that most listeners would say yes  to.  Yeah, I think they would.  How am I?  For looking at porn when you're in a relationship?  Come on.  The fact that using pornography and looking at porn is different.  All right.  What do you mean by using porn?  If you're perusing the web, some news sites and shit like that.  Right.  And you come across a fucking nude picture and you're like, wow, that chick's hot. 
[01:44:00]  That's hot.  Sure.  Okay.  And you just watch some videos.  If you're sitting there for hours on end jerking off the fucking hours on end.  I think that's an individual thing.  Because there's a healthy part.  Continue to use pornography.  All I'm saying is there's a healthy part to the question and an unhealthy part.  They're not explaining it further.  Well, I don't think if you've looked at pornography or used it once or twice since you're married.  I think that when you read that, you look at that and you go like, God, I have been fucking  doing that a lot.  Yeah, but I think if you're taking this quiz, if you're answering these questions, you have 
[01:44:30]  doubts.  I think it's tricking people into thinking they're sex addicts.  I really do.  Because these questions have to be a little more deeper than this.  This was the first test we pulled up.  After this, we take this.  We'll look at another one and see if the questions are any different.  Yeah, and let's see what the next rest of the questions are.  But I already have three yeses, and I think that's completely normal for most people listening  to this fucking show.  Number six, does your sexuality seem to be dragging down your personal potential? 
[01:45:00]  Think about that.  All right, now that's a normal question.  It's iffy, but...  What?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Really?  Does your sexuality seem to be dragging down your personal potential?  It goes a little bit.  Without a doubt.  Yeah, yeah.  All the energy wasted?  Exactly.  I'm not saying you, I'm saying me.  All the energy wasted, all the bad decisions I've made which have damaged personal relationships?  But that's...  That's...  Fuck, yeah.  A more normal sex addiction question is what I'm saying. 
[01:45:30]  I wrote yes because there are things I absolutely could have or should have been doing besides  sexual things.  Sure.  Then everyone would say yes to that.  Nah, you got it.  But again, you got to gauge it.  You got to weigh it.  Are you thinking of it like, fuck, there's a lot of shit?  Yeah, but overall, I was like...  Yeah, I missed fucking, you know, this because I was jerking over from...  Overall, I would say no to that question, but yeah, but I'm sure there's probably something  I should have done, but I had sex instead.  But your personal experience has been no for that. 
[01:46:00]  Like, you know deep down that's not affecting your life.  No, in general, I would say no to that question, but even...  Yeah, go ahead.  This solves it.  This whole test is a test.  You have to have the mindset to look at that in each question and go, fuck.  It might trigger something in your head.  Yeah.  All right, I'll get you there.  So you're looking at a question like, you know, thinking, ah, that's nothing.  Everybody does that.  But a sex addict might look at it like, oh my God, I really do that.  You know, that's a big problem.  Yeah, that makes just no absolute.  It's not like if you've done that a few times, you're an addict.  It makes more sense. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, it's just starting to trigger shit in your head.  And here it is, here it is.  Have you been in a relationship just for sex?  That question.  Let's take that one.  If you fucking saw some chick in a bar or something, picked her up, and you're fucking  her, and then you see her a little more than you might want to, that's one thing.  If you're just, you feel nothing for anybody, but sex...  Or you hate them.  That's a...  Or you hate them, right?  And you're still with them because you want to fuck them.  Right, right, right.  That's what they're saying.  There's a problem. 
[01:47:00]  Number seven, people, pick up your pens.  Do you find that you spend a significant amount of time viewing pornography or grooming others  for sexual encounters?  No.  Why?  E.  E.  Absolutely for me.  I'm going to guess Tiger would say yes.  Say yes for Tiger.  Holy shit.  Or grooming people?  Yes.  I expected a lot of yeses from Jimmy, but not Anthony.  I'm kind of guessing the shit out of myself here.  I gave Tiger, to be honest with you, I didn't know for number two what he considers normal, 
[01:47:30]  so I didn't answer that.  Number five, have you continued to use pornography after entering a long time committed?  With him, I put a question mark.  I'm going to don't know.  I'm going to guess yes for that one, but I really don't know.  Yeah, we don't know him for sure.  If he watches porn, but I guess six and seven for him, sexuality, is he going to be dragging  down your personal?  I would say definitely yes.  And for seven, do you spend grooming other sexual encounters?  For seven, I would say I have to say yes.  You've talked to all these chicks.  That's grooming.  Right.  True.  Okay.  Number eight.  All right.  Eight.  Have you experienced an unwanted sexual encounter during childhood or adolescence? 
[01:48:00]  Unwanted?  No.  Isn't that blacked out in most of us?  No.  Again, people who haven't thought of that may be sparked.  I don't know on that one for me either.  I've had so many when I was a kid, but were any of them unwanted?  I don't remember.  I initiated a lot of them.  Yeah, I'm writing a no.  For myself, I had to put don't know.  Unwanted.  Right.  You're so bad to that, didn't you?  Yeah.  I was thinking it's like, it's nothing really unwanted that was sexual. 
[01:48:30]  You've been on the other end of it.  A lot of people are answering yes.  Picturing your ghoulish face.  Jesus Christ.  That guy with the hat.  He got the guns and his big boots.  Creep.  Yes, this creep came after me.  He made my hiney Thor.  And then he did voices.  He sounded like the real people.  What do you mean he was Thor?  He sounded like Mike Tyson or Ronald Reagan.  I don't know who they are.  And it hurt my cool teeth.  Ken from Connecticut.  This test indicates that I'm a sex addict and I never get laid. 
[01:49:00]  Well, what's the last question?  Number nine.  Has monogamous sex grown to be boring?  You're talking about the past, Dan?  You got to.  No, I'm just talking about like, this is, that's, I think that's more basic human nature.  But again, if you look at it as an addict, you might go like, there isn't a guy alive that is in a monogamous relationship and keeping himself in a monogamous relationship. 
[01:49:30]  And not even going to cheat, that doesn't think about like, fuck, man, I'd love some new tail.  You know?  I think every human thinks that, too.  Yeah, but are you acting on it?  Things like that.  They're talking about people that are just poor.  I think that's easy.  Yeah, I personally, my guess was Tiger.  I think that's a yes to duty.  Yes to duty.  I gave Tiger six yeses out of nine.  Yes.  Three, four, five, six.  I gave Tiger six yeses. 
[01:50:00]  I have one, two, three, four, five.  I have six yeses.  I have eight with one don't know.  I just don't know about the childhood, if it was unwanted or not.  I have three no's.  I have three in the middle there.  What's the one?  One to three.  Yeah.  It does not seem that you're presently an active sexual addict.  If your concern continues, we recommend that you get more information.  Now, that's what those questions were.  Are you using pornography after the marriage?  Are you doing this?  If you're doing a couple of these things, add it up.  It may be, eh, possibly the signs, maybe not. 
[01:50:30]  That's pretty fair.  Yeah.  Four to six points, people.  It seems you may be struggling in the area of sexual addiction.  Your first step would be to gather further information.  Get books from our recommendations.  Yeah, thanks.  Exactly.  If you want more practical techniques for your behavior, listen to and view our webcast.  There's a little self-interest going on here.  But I guess they figure, you know, you got a little bit of some issues, four to six. 
[01:51:00]  And seven to nine points, you are probably sexually addicted.  It is recommended that you gather more information, again, from our recommended books.  Going to a recovery group.  I'm going to have Danny.  Counseling.  I'm going to have Danny look up.  I don't want to say it because it's a 12-step group.  I won't, whatever.  But I want him to look one of, I think it'll be, it's probably a 20 questions game.  A little more accurate.  Not that we need to redo all of them.  But I think that the 20 questions for these people are much more accurate. 
[01:51:30]  Rex in Massachusetts said we missed a 10th question.  Oh?  Yeah, number 10.  Have you ejaculated since the beginning of this quiz?  Yes.  And are you on a bus?  Right.  All right.  Is there a test?  We're looking for a test.  40.  But, no, we're not going to answer 40.  But let's look at a couple of them.  40 questions again.  But that makes more sense.  Yes.  Because we're going to get deeper with the questions.  Not just do you think.  Those nine questions were very vague and very just general.  More accurate. 
[01:52:00]  They want you to fucking look at that and go, I might have a problem.  This particular self-help group is, you'll know.  Here's a few questions.  Have you ever tried to control how much sex to have or how often you would see someone?  For me, that's a yes.  Do you find yourself unable to stop seeing a specific person even though you know that  seeing that person is destructive to you?  Wow, these are a little more.  These are fucking amazingly good questions.  This is what I was getting at before.  Yeah.  Do you feel that you don't want anyone to know about your sexual or romantic activities? 
[01:52:30]  Do you feel you need to hide these activities from others?  Friends, family, co-workers, audience of millions.  Do you get high from sex and or romance?  Do you crash?  Wow.  That's number four.  But don't all guys crash after sex?  Not sleeping crash, but they mean the emotional high, like coming off cocaine.  Do you get, that's like a depression, like an emotional crash.  When you're just, when you're foaming at the mouth and everywhere else and then that's done.  Dude, you have sex after sex.  There's a natural crash. 
[01:53:00]  But it's a lowdown, but after sex, you don't want, you don't, you don't feel depressed?  No.  No.  That's more to talk about.  And you have?  Dude, you understand after sex.  I'm trying to understand that.  Oh my, I have felt, there's been times when I'm in a healthy relationship, I don't feel  bad about it.  But when it's a high and it's an avoidance and I'm just jerking off afterwards, I'm like,  ah, or after I've gotten prostitutes, man, I'm like, I'm just, I'm depressed and I'm  sad.  I'm like, what am I doing?  You're fucking worthless.  What are you, oh dude, it's horrendous.  It's a horrible crash.  Have you had sex at inappropriate times in inappropriate places and or with inappropriate 
[01:53:30]  people?  That's all one question.  That's just one question.  Yeah.  Do you make promises to yourself or rules for yourself concerning your sexual or romantic  behavior that you find you cannot follow?  Well, all I'm thinking of is Jimmy on these and every single one has been yes.  So far, everyone is a yes.  Have you had or do you have sex with somebody you don't slash didn't want to have sex with?  Absolutely.  Do you?  Wow.  Really?  Oh, dude.  Many times I've been in this situation where, um, and I don't think I knew I didn't want 
[01:54:00]  to.  I think I confused everything and I made everything sexual.  Like I would have a girl over who I just genuinely liked or wanted to hang out with.  And yet my only way to relate to somebody is to be sexual.  Right.  So I would pull my dick out.  Uh, or I would just didn't want to do it deep down.  Not you don't consciously make that aware to yourself, but you don't know it.  Like with prostitutes, there's times I picked up prostitutes I was not at all attracted to.  I didn't want to be sexual with, but I had to, it's again, if you're in a bar and your  beer isn't, you find any beer, you take it. 
[01:54:30]  That's the way it was.  Yeah.  Okay.  Wow.  Have you had, uh, or have sex with somebody you didn't want to be, have sex with?  Yeah.  Do you believe that sex and or a relationship will make your life bearable?  Hmm.  That's a little weird.  Have you ever felt that you had to have sex?  This is about sex and love addiction.  Yeah.  Okay.  Do you believe that someone can fix you?  Do you keep a list written or otherwise of the number of partners you've had?  I did, I did one for a therapist. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  It was.  Oh, I believe this is not junkie pride.  This is in some of the stuff's humiliating.  There was one list was years ago, actually, um, where it was, and this was up to, up to  that point.  It was a span of about a year and a half.  Um, and, and then, and it wasn't even as far along as it is now, or, uh, it has been,  I would say I did a thing on one relationship I had cheated through and it was 11 pages of 
[01:55:30]  stuff.  Holy shit.  Nice.  No bullshit.  No.  And a lot of those were listed, multiple partners were just listed in parentheses.  Like if I saw one hooker eight times, I wouldn't list her eight times.  Wow.  I would just put her name in parentheses.  11 pages.  Yeah.  You are fucked up.  That's great.  Double spaced.  I mean, do you, do you feel desperation or uneasiness when you're away from your lover  or sexual partner?  Hmm.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:56:00]  Have you lost count of the number of sexual partners you've had?  Yeah.  Do you feel desperate about your need for lover, sexual fix, or future mate?  Hmm.  Hmm.  I think I'm like more of that relationship addict kind of a thing than sexual addiction.  Yeah.  This is sex and love addiction.  Yeah.  Wow.  Have you, or do you have sex regardless of the consequences, e.g. the threat of being  caught, the risk of contracting herpes, gonorrhea, AIDS, et cetera.  Yep.  Do you find that you have a pattern of repeating bad relationships? 
[01:56:30]  Wow.  I gotta take this test.  Do you feel that your only or major value in a relationship is your ability to perform  sexually or provide an emotional fix?  Yeah.  Fuck, am I fucked up.  The beauty of this is you think, you think, because this is such a complete questionnaire,  you think like, no, I don't do that with sex, but then they throw in, or emotional fix,  and you're like, yeah, you bitch, fixer-upper coming up. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  Do you feel like a lifeless puppet unless there's someone around with you whom you can flirt?  Do you feel like you're not really alive unless you're with your sexual slash romantic partner?  Hmm.  Do you feel entitled to have sex?  That's interesting.  Thanks to the radio show I do.  I never did.  Boy, you throw me in front of a microphone, cock out immediately.  Fuck me, dummy.  But what is that question about?  Do you feel entitled to have sex?  Don't most people feel that? 
[01:57:30]  No.  Like, you feel like, yeah, I deserve sex with, like, I don't really understand that question.  Because people will go on dates, like, and go out and go like, hey, let's go out to dinner  a few times, and you'll fool around.  Right.  And you want sex, and you're like, ah, fuck it, she wouldn't give it to me.  But you understand the game.  Right.  But after a while, it literally got to a point, and, uh, where I had girls over who I really  didn't know that well at all, and was trying to pull my cock out immediately, even though  the vibe wasn't there, I was just entitled, you're here, I gotta fuck. 
[01:58:00]  And for me, it was never forceful, but it was that, that self-entitlement, I felt like  I should have it.  And if you're not gonna get it, you're gonna get pissed.  Yeah, and I felt rejected and hurt when I didn't get it, and then angry at the person,  I would cut them out of my life.  It was very selfish.  That's a gray area question.  I think it'll, it could be, you know, anybody could feel like they're entitled if they go  out and stuff, but it's, but you understand in the end, you're like, all right, all right,  it wasn't gonna, it wasn't gonna be whatever.  Put in the context of the other questions, yeah, it makes sense.  Right, right, sure, sure.  Do you find yourself in a relationship that you cannot leave?  Wow. 
[01:58:30]  Ugh.  Right?  God damn it.  Have you put down a yes for me, too?  I was a fucking asshole for so many goddamn years.  Have you, have you ever threatened your financial stability or standing in the community by pursuing  a sexual part?  I hate tiger.  Exactly.  Well, yeah.  Do you believe that the problem in your love life results from not having enough of, or  the right kind of sex, or from continuing to remain with the wrong person?  Fuck yes.  Have you ever had a serious relationship threatened or destroyed because of outside sexual activity? 
[01:59:00]  Fuck yes.  Do you feel like life would have no meaning without a love relationship or without sex?  Do you feel like you would have no identity if you were not someone's lover?  I say yes to the first part of that, yeah.  I say yes to that fucking question.  I have a lot of yeses on this.  Yeah.  I swear to you, I have a lot of fucking yeses.  You're a fixer, Ant.  You're a rescuer and a love addict.  Is this a sex addict quiz or sex addict slash, what, relationship? 
[01:59:30]  I think this is more for sexual and love addiction, like the whole combination.  Gotcha.  Do you find yourself flirting or sexualizing with someone even if you don't mean to?  Yeah.  Yep.  Inappropriate questions or innuendos or, or, or.  Or just the different way you present yourself.  Intriguing, yeah.  Does your sexual and or romantic behavior affect your reputation?  Hey, Jimmy.  But it does in a way, because the scary part about it is like, what if you let it go?  What am I?  Like, you know what I mean?  Even though I'm in a relationship and I'm actually happy, I mean, but it doesn't matter. 
[02:00:00]  It's like with pornography, I mean, it's still, I'm still the same fucking guy, even though  I'm not doing the same shit.  Do you have sex and or relationships to try to deal with or escape from life's problems?  People do that?  What?  That, that question.  Sex and relationships to deal with or escape from life's problems.  I don't know.  Like an alcoholic will drink or a drug addict will do drugs to get away from life's problems  to forget.  Yeah.  A lot of times I might use masturbation or, or, or, or massages or whatever to get away 
[02:00:30]  from, from my fears.  Boredom.  Yeah.  Do you feel uncomfortable about your masturbation because of the frequency with which you masturbate?  The fantasies you engage in, the props you use, and or the places in which you do  it?  Do you feel uncomfortable?  Yeah.  There would probably be.  The fantasies you engage in, let's be honest.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  All right.  That could be a little uncomfortable.  Do you engage in the practice of voyeurism, exhibitionism, et cetera, in ways that bring discomfort 
[02:01:00]  and pain?  No.  No.  That's my first no.  Or one of my first no's.  Yeah.  No, no.  Do you find yourself needing greater and greater variety and energy in your sexual or romantic  activities just to achieve an acceptable level of physical and emotional relief?  Yeah.  Greater variety and energy.  Oh, God.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  Do you feel that your sexual and romantic behavior is about as rewarding as hijacking  a revolving door?  Are you jaded?  Fuck yeah, man. 
[02:01:30]  Are you unable to concentrate in other areas of life because of your thoughts and feelings  you have about another person or about sex?  Abso-fucking-lutely.  Thirty-four are we up to?  Yeah.  Do you find yourself obsessing about a specific person or sexual act even though these thoughts  bring pain, craving, or discomfort?  Absolutely.  Have you ever wished you could stop or control your sexual and or romantic activities for  a given period of time?  Have you ever wished you could be less emotionally dependent?  Yep.  Okay. 
[02:02:00]  Do you find the pain in your life increasing no matter what you do?  Are you afraid that deep down you are unacceptable?  No, I...  You are unacceptable.  I know it.  I'm not afraid I am.  I'm positive of it.  That's what I was toiling over.  Jesus.  Do you feel that you lack dignity and wholeness?  That's a tough one.  Dignity?  I can't think... 
[02:02:30]  Yeah, yeah, okay.  I'll take the wholeness part.  I don't lack dignity, but I don't feel like, you know...  I can't think of a more definite word than yes to scream for that question.  I'm, um...  Wow.  People are very depressed out there.  But I mean...  Because they're answering yes to a lot of...  This is a very, very thorough questionnaire.  A lot of people answering a lot of yeses.  Do you feel that your sexuality and or romantic life affects your spiritual life in a negative  way?  I'm not a very spiritual person, so that doesn't really matter to me.  Do you feel that your life is unmanageable because of your sexual and or romantic behavior 
[02:03:00]  or your excessive dependency needs?  Yes.  Yes.  And lastly, have you ever thought that there might be more you could do with your life  if you are not so driven by sexual and romantic pursuits?  Fuck yeah, man.  I probably have three no's in that whole test.  And there's a lot of people with a lot of no's in that.  But what if you enjoy your sex life in number 40?  They're not talking about that. 
[02:03:30]  That has nothing to do with enjoying a healthy sex life.  But I'm just saying, like...  Those fucking questions have nothing to do with it.  Ooh, boy, that was...  You could be doing more with your life, but do you really want to be doing more with...  You know what I mean?  But it doesn't say, do you enjoy your sex...  It's not like, could I clean the pool or get a blowjob?  You're going to take the blowjob.  Right, right.  But it's like, you know, if your pool is black and there's dead children in it,  and, you know, they should have cleaned the pool a long time ago.  And you're fucking 20 times in one day.  I got you.  Yeah, it's like, there's times where I want to write more.  Like, I'm working on a pilot, which I have written. 
[02:04:00]  But it's like, I should be going over that, or I should be doing this.  And it just puts you in this weird mindset, because your obsession is in one direction.  Yeah.  You know?  And even though it's like, even having a girlfriend doesn't matter.  Because you're thinking of stuff, or just looking at porn.  Right.  Or just perusing porn.  It's like, for what?  I might have been horny.  What am I doing?  Have you ever just looked at porn, and then looked at the clock and gone,  oh my god, I have to get up in an hour.  And I'm fucking, I've been just gazing at pornography.  Do you understand that I literally, 
[02:04:30]  I at times will start watching porn at 6 p.m., and then my spot at the cellar, they have  to be there at 9.30, and I have to call Esty on the way down and go, look, I'll be there  in five minutes.  Because I was fucking, I had my fucking...  No one wants to touch the mic after you.  No, but I wasn't blowing anybody, I was just jerking off.  That's what I mean.  Oh, okay, thank God.  It's all good.  Let me ask you something.  The on button is stuck.  But Jimmy, you don't do that when you're going on Leno, right?  No, no, no, no.  So what's the difference?  I don't, because the enormity of what I'm doing, in the sense of... 
[02:05:00]  So you're able to control, because you know, whoa, I can't fuck up with this.  I'll tell you one thing, though, when I'm out in L.A., boredom's a very, it's a killer  for me.  Right.  And, like, say we get the things, when I'm working on my piece, I do zone out like that  in Jerkoff.  When I'm doing an uninvited guest, Jonathan will come to pick me up to do the improv, and  I'm fucking zoned out before that, just jacking or looking at porn, or a lot of times we'll  get the topics for the roundtable discussion the day before.  And I write, but I'm being sexual while I write. 
[02:05:30]  I don't have a person there.  It's just me.  Gotcha.  I'm looking at porn, but I also got my fucking Word document open.  It's like, it's a way for me to create without...  Multitask.  Dude, I wrote both my books like that.  It's a way for me, that's why I would write at the comedy show, because I couldn't jerk  off while I was writing.  That's how crazy it got.  I would bring my laptop to the cellar and write, because...  That's fucking hell on earth, dude.  It's fucking brutal.  That is fucking...  The right balance, I can be very creative in, though.  Yeah.  But I'm afraid if I don't have that, what am I going to be? 
[02:06:00]  Get an assistant to jerk you off while you type, so you can just do it.  I can't have an assistant.  You think I'm going to get a guy?  Hey, this is Franz.  He jerks me off while I write.  He's not gay.  But I don't do anything to risk Leno, because they pick me up during the day, and most times  I'm not that sexual at noon or two in the afternoon.  It's usually at night.  A lot of people will answer, and a lot of questions with guests out there in radio line.  Yeah.  Why don't we take a break, and we've got to do all the bullet points with Tiger.  Sure. 
[02:06:30]  There's like eight of them.  We only did two.  And then we've got this Jamie Jungers.  Jesus, this fucking...  To me, I think she's despicable.  To come out with that information, I think she's despicable.  No, who's not?  The Perkins waitress we make fun of.  Right.  She's not yapping.  She got caught up in the whole thing, but she's not yapping.  She knows to stay hidden.  All right, we'll get into some more Tiger Woods stuff after the break.  O&A.  All right, here we go.  So we're going through the Tiger Woods bullet points here.  Already did the, you know, indefinite break from golf. 
[02:07:00]  That's ridiculous.  To be a better husband and father.  Golf was the one thing he was doing right.  Temptations on the road are probably tough, though, man.  That's a hard thing when you're going away, and you're in that position where you can get whatever you want.  It's got to be hard.  This relationship with him and his wife, unfixable.  So why are they even, like, going through the motions?  It's unfixable.  Now there's people coming out saying, oh, my God, we had orgies, and we had 15 girls at one time that was hanging with him. 
[02:07:30]  I'll tell you what.  It's unfixable.  But he's got kids, and it's also...  That's why she's so a little confused and hasn't left yet, because of the kid angle.  And you want to stop the bleeding.  Like, you don't want to do anything else stupid in this time.  Right.  And he probably knows, like, look, you know, it's hard to say no.  Right.  So why go out and put that temptation there when you can fuck up?  As far as sports goes, though, we've got another Jordan situation.  Jordan walks away from the game during his prime.  And now you're looking at a Tiger Woods walking away from the game for a while during his prime. 
[02:08:00]  We already did the sponsorship.  Accenture, where he made, I think, between $10 and $15 million a year.  Dropped Tiger.  Gillette phasing him out.  AT&T re-evaluating their relationship.  That doesn't sound good at all.  No, they should re-evaluate their fucking cell phone coverage.  Why don't they do that?  Instead of worrying about Tiger and where he's putting his dick, how about you put a cell tower on it?  It's in more places than your fucking coverage is.  That's what they ought to do.  Put a fucking chip on his cock.  At least Tiger's map looks like Verizon. 
[02:08:30]  He just has dots all over the place.  At least I'll get a fucking reception in Perkins.  Tiger's map of where he sprayed his jizz is pretty impressive.  It's goo.  AT&T, you assholes.  Oh, what else we got?  His wife might go for a separation after Christmas.  Was seen without wedding ring this weekend.  Jamie Junger says her and Tiger had sex the night.  His dad died.  That's why I think she's repulsive.  And they were in bed when he found out.  We're going to go to that audio in a second. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  British court blocks the publication of certain Tiger photos, but they refuse to say what they may be.  Playgirl says a woman wanted a half million dollars for ten cell phone pictures of Tiger, and they have declined.  They're pretty certain they're Tiger's...  They're pictures of Tiger, I should say.  Tiger dick pictures, right?  Pretty certain, but they're not willing to...  They're saying it's tacky or something like that in the paper today?  Bullshit.  They're probably afraid of getting sued.  They just don't know for sure.  Oh, what...  Tiger would never allow a chick to photograph my hope unless it was just his cock. 
[02:09:30]  Why?  He's shown such responsible behavior up till now.  Dude, no addict.  I'm a fucking perv, and I wouldn't allow that.  Really?  Maybe.  Tiger's caddy, and this is the biggest bullshit that's coming out overnight.  Well, Tiger's caddy...  Hey, he's a soldier, though.  Good for him.  Says he had no idea about Tiger's infidelity and never saw anything.  That's complete bullshit, in my opinion.  He's a good caddy.  But he also sees a lot of money going away if he tells the truth.  Sorry.  See, like, a lot of times a photo, you can't see...  Like, look at that, Ant.  You can't see much. 
[02:10:00]  You can only see a hand with what looks like a lot of jizz in it, and you can't see...  Oh, my God.  You can't see which hand it is.  Oh, my God.  Why would you show...  Why are you showing us Jay Leno's jizz?  Not Leno's jizz.  That'd be on my chin.  No, it's a young man.  It could be me.  You notice I'm on the towel, too.  Proud of myself, of course.  Tee-hee.  And then the Department of Children and Families refused to confirm report that child welfare  visited Tiger's home over the weekend.  Took pictures with him and got him to sign something. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, exactly.  So you want to hear this Jamie Junger's audio?  Jamie Junger's.  Good old Jamie Junger's.  She's a hot one.  News of the world.  She's just yapping, enjoying her fame.  Just enjoying the hell out of it.  It's not going to lead to anything, you fucking whore.  A lot of these whores think it leads to something in the end.  No.  You just continue to sell yourself, basically, for nothing.  I was running with some friends one night, and a VIP host came over and asked if I'd 
[02:11:00]  like to join Tiger over at his table.  And I kind of laughed because I said, Tiger who?  And he said, Tiger Woods.  Yeah, he gave me his phone number, and we made arrangements to see each other again that  following weekend for the U.S. Open.  He agreed to fly me out to the Chicago Open.  Bitch.  And from there on, we saw each other at least once a month or more several times a month  from there on out. 
[02:11:30]  And then it became to the point where we were comfortable with each other.  He would fly me out to his home in California, and I would stay there.  I fucking hate her.  Yeah.  I fucking...  I'm not saying what he did was right, but I hate her.  Yeah.  Yeah, she is.  I'm with you.  God, I hate this chick.  When they're just talking like they're testifying like that, um, we went out, he gave the number, 
[02:12:00]  and then we met, and...  What...  Why are you saying this?  And why is everybody, all the op-eds and all that shit, I understand what he did wasn't  right, but how do people not understand that the curiosity or the obsession with this is  a reflection on us as a whole?  How can people not understand that?  That our morbid gotcha, gotcha curiosity is a reflection on our own fucking self-righteousness  and dishonesty?  We know that a lot of men would be very, very likely to do what he did given that opportunity. 
[02:12:30]  Right.  And no one says it.  No, no.  It's holier than thou.  They're all like...  Holy shit.  Oh, the tiger saga continues.  Let's look in your fucking closet.  Yeah.  Let's look in your...  What are you...  Who are you fucking...  What a sanctimonious, disgusting fucking group we are.  Yeah.  Americans.  We really are.  I'm not saying the Brits are any better, but we are a sanctimonious country full of assholes.  Yeah, the Brits papers are fucking just as bad. 
[02:13:00]  Horrible.  They're worse, in some cases.  Nobody is saying that.  Why are no...  Why is not one of these fucking despicable journalists going, you know what?  His wife probably should leave him.  It's a shitty thing he did.  But the curiosity we feel...  Why do we feel we need to know?  Why is what she's saying interesting?  I just say that.  He's on TV.  But you understand...  I know.  I just...  I know.  I know I'm a perv.  I know I'm a voyeur.  I admit that.  Why won't the country as a whole... 
[02:13:30]  Why won't we just admit this is what it is?  If...  Are there any hack comics yet doing that?  Well, if he were married to a black woman, that wouldn't have happened.  Am I right?  Am I right?  Am I right?  No.  I bet your black comics are saying that and black crowds are applauding.  Yeah.  Like, yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Good point.  Because you're right.  Black athletes don't cheat on black wives.  Tiger Woods with a lot of white women.  You see that?  Let me tell you something.  He wouldn't have gotten away with that marriage to her sister. 
[02:14:00]  I covered it up.  Everybody's fucking hooting and hollering.  They're hooting and hollering.  Yep.  You're seeing the crowds at...  You got another one?  You got another one?  Black comic.  Black comic doing a little tight.  I'll tell you that.  He'd have come home late one night and sister would have whooped his ass.  I'd like to see him come in the door and say, uh, where have you been?  Well, I was out golfing.  Golfing?  How are you? 
[02:14:30]  You were running my brother?  Well, if you're golfing, how come you got stuff on in front of your pants?  Oh, damn.  Oh, damn.  That was a target in the doghouse.  Oh, my God.  That's right.  That's right.  Woo-hoo-hoo. 
[02:15:00]  I'm not.  I'm not.  Let's say hi to Steve in Pennsylvania.  Steve, how are you today?  Yes.  What's going on, boy?  Word.  Hey, is Tiger giving this all up for pussy or what?  I mean, it's a letdown because we all like watching the golf.  But, man, all that over, you know, one box?  No.  He's just trying to stop the bleeding for a little while.  He probably can't concentrate on golf. 
[02:15:30]  He's a private guy, dude.  His whole personal life has been blown out.  But any one of us, picture your private shit.  Hold on, man.  You guys are missing the point.  He's not quitting golf over his wife.  It's a whole empire he has to rebuild.  It's a whole fucking empire.  Doesn't anyone understand that?  Yeah.  It's not about the wife anymore.  He, like, makes enough money, the same amount of money a small country makes.  And there's a lot of people that make a lot of money off Tiger Woods.  He has to rebuild that whole fucking empire again.  And he feels like, well, if I walk away from the game, that'll be one way I could do this. 
[02:16:00]  He's not walking away from the game to figure out what he's going to do with the wife.  He's just not.  That's part of it.  This is he can't fucking step up to that first tee right now.  Right.  And he won't be able to in a couple of months.  He lost.  It's going to turn out he loses tens of millions of dollars from his sponsorships alone.  He's got to rebuild that whole fucking image again so he can get all that money coming back in.  I mean, it's not about just the wife golf ratings have dropped 50 percent because I know you golf fans like it. 
[02:16:30]  No, no one wants to watch that fucking sport who isn't a hardcore golf fan.  That was what made it exciting.  Non golf fans were watching for Tiger.  Ask me.  This is my expertise.  I'm telling you, when Tiger was out with the injury.  Yeah.  Ratings were down about 50 percent.  The sport needs Tiger.  Absolutely.  No one is going to be.  I shouldn't say no one, but the ratings are going to be a lot lower without Tiger Woods on that golf course.  Are the advertisers going to say, hey, look, he's not playing and we understand ratings are down, so we're still going to pay the same amount for ads? 
[02:17:00]  No.  They're going to start losing money.  Of course.  Tiger will be back.  And that's why then the sponsorships are going to go, ah, fuck, we got to fucking get Tiger Woods sponsoring our shit again.  Because they're going to realize they're losing too much money without him.  Fuck yeah.  It's not walking away from golf just for the wife angle.  It's a whole fucking empire he fucked up.  The whole thing's gone.  But again, the whole empire is going away.  At least it's for a lot of chicks.  That's the beauty.  If it was for one chick, that's probably where you want to kill her than kill yourself. 
[02:17:30]  But it's so much.  It's like, God, I just fucked everywhere.  It's like, there's not one thing he could look at.  It's like, he put his dick everywhere.  How do you not love this dude?  I love him.  And he patches it up with the wife just to help his image to get the sponsorships coming back in.  I'm telling you.  I don't even think he's patching it up for the right reasons with his wife.  I thought she was saying.  A much bigger reason.  She's fucking going.  I was wrong.  I think she's leaving.  She's not leaving.  Yeah, because again, she is a beautiful woman.  You raised a good point last week where you said Hillary Clinton's an older woman. 
[02:18:00]  Selda Spitzer.  Selda.  All I'm saying is if you're a shallow broad and you're into someone because they're really famous or really rich, that's fine.  But you'll find another one of those that'll treat you a little better than the current situation you're in.  Or she was in.  She's a fucking smoking hot model.  If that's what she's all about.  Right.  She doesn't need this shit.  She'll go to the next.  If that's what she's about, we don't know.  She'll get another really famous rich athlete.  It's humiliating.  This is about being embarrassed.  That's humiliating shit.  Right.  One indiscretion. 
[02:18:30]  Even what Spitzer did with some hookers is easier to get over for a wife because it's such an impersonal thing.  Look, he threw a few bucks out.  He's a guy.  He was a pig.  But what Tiger was doing, flying them to his house, not wearing a bag.  He did some personal shit that as a wife had got to be rough.  Yeah.  Unless she knew the whole time.  Nah.  She would be making vocal statements supporting him if she knew.  Unless she knew, but there was something that she didn't know.  I don't know.  I think she'd be supporting him vocally. 
[02:19:00]  No, man.  Because there were people talking.  A lot of people have been talking about this, Tiger.  Everyone but her and Tiger.  You haven't heard a word, like a written statement, quick little thing at the beginning.  But now, you just don't hear from Tiger.  How many shitty mornings do you think he's woken up for a second in the middle of the night  and just thought, hopefully it was a dream?  Yeah, we've been talking about it the whole time.  You missed a bit.  That's why I was asking Andy if he wants to wake up Tiger.  Oh, is that what that means?  Oh, and it's been doing a killer bit with the whole thing. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, yeah.  Because you do have those dreams, and like, oh, my God, that was a dream.  Thank God.  Oh, well.  We'll do one.  Oh, my God.  Oh, I wonder what I'll do today.  Oh, what's the next tournament?  I think it's in January?  Oh, what a nice night's sleep.  I don't know why I haven't had such a good night's sleep in a while. 
[02:20:00]  Fuck, I lost 30 million in endorsements.  Holy shit, I fucked everything that moved.  My wife's leaving me.  Holy shit.  I forgot for a second.  Fucking got me snorting.  Fucking asshole.  There is that just moment where you're just at bliss.  Dude, he's in hell.  And you realize, oh, I'm fucked.  He's in fucking hell.  He can't play golf, and he can't bang broads.  What is left for the guy?  Dude, Leno has a funny bit where this, like, the stage turns around, and it's like a game 
[02:20:30]  show, and this guy, Jim Wise, is standing there in a tuxedo.  And he's like, what's Tiger's count?  It's up to 13!  And then he just turns around, and he's gone.  It's so obnoxious.  It's very funny.  It's literally a 20-second bit to just point out another Tiger brought us to that.  Yeah, let's throw this in the mix.  Andy in Cleveland.  Andy.  Yeah, I don't know if this has anything to do with a scandal.  The manager at the store said it didn't, but I was at a Toys R Us this past weekend, 
[02:21:00]  and then one of the end caps, actually, in the Toys R Us, stopped dead in my track and  said, I don't fucking believe it.  And for all these kids, it was funny.  But all the Tiger Woods action figures on clearance.  Yeah, a lot of Tiger stuff is on clearance.  Did you say you wore an end cap?  Yeah, there was an end, you know, like, at the end of the aisle.  Oh, end cap.  End cap.  I thought you said you went in wearing an end cap.  I thought it was a cap.  No, no, no.  With the word on the front. 
[02:21:30]  Oh, okay.  The action figures are on clearance.  It's funny.  They're going to have to build a new one now.  With a fucking workable penis.  I was just going to ask, where do you buy one?  I'm punching out, guys.  What do you buy one?  Someone goes, how much of a racist is ant?  All right, why don't we see what else Jamie Junkers had to say.  While I was with him in California, he was real relaxed.  He was kind of like a little kid. 
[02:22:00]  He loved watching ESPN, loved cartoons.  And he ate cereal, popsicles, did things like, pretty much like a little kid would do.  I mean, he was a lot of fun to be around.  He had her first call me.  How dumb is this, Broad?  She just described every fucking guy out there.  Who likes cartoons, ESPN, popsicles.  What a dope tiger is.  What an idiot.  What an adult.  What an uninteresting asshole.  See, he's sitting there. 
[02:22:30]  He's a Flintstones thing.  He liked bouncing a rubber ball and making the yummy noise.  What a card.  Yeah, there's other baby things.  That's just regular fucking adult male shit we do.  That's the type of shit that will drive his wife crazy,  because that's what her husband does when he's home.  Right.  The popsicles, that'll get her.  I don't see you hate Jamie Junkers.  I just hate the fact that she talked about that he was with her when his father died.  That's such an unnecessary, piggish piece of information.  Well, she's garbage.  She probably doesn't even know she's garbage yet. 
[02:23:00]  She'll learn that she really is just a piece of fucking garbage.  And then...  Jamie, can I have a popsicle, please?  Fred's bowling.  That's funny.  Ooh, you varmint!  Look, he's got to go back to the ship for another match.  Why doesn't he just take a few matches?  Hey, one of the who is, is on the Today Show right now, matter of fact. 
[02:23:30]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, well, there's so many of them, they get to, you know, bounce around.  Tiger's the only black guy I've ever seen with messy hair.  How the fuck does a black guy have messy hair?  He has gigantic choppers, too.  Catch a picture of Tiger from the side.  Fucking Kevin Dillon should be bashing his brains in his fucking...  Holy shit, does he have fucking big platoon teeth.  That's how Tiger laughs.  That's how the Tiger laughs.  Look at him.  God, his wife was smoking. 
[02:24:00]  Let's do the whole golf course.  Yeah, look at her.  His wife is ridiculous.  But you know what?  I've noticed chicks that look like that, usually, fucking horrible duds in the sack.  They've never had to spit in a guy's asshole to keep his interest.  They haven't.  They haven't.  Their nails are too long to finger your fucking ghoulie.  They're the worst.  They lay there with their fucking pseudo-puke breath and their rotten back teeth.  Breathing their fucking rotten Jamba Juice breath.  Because they fucking make themselves vomit and then have to drink juice and Coke to cover it up. 
[02:24:30]  It's like it's puke and cherry Coke, you fucking self-hating idiot.  Will you move your hips?  You fucking rot.  I can feel your ass bone.  Can you talk dirty?  Ooh.  Stop blowing vomit breath in my face.  Say something hot.  Make a cuckold out of me, you fucking zilch.  Those smoking hot chicks are fucking usually terrible in the sack.  Hey, fucking Lance Kerwin hair.  Why don't you put two fingers in my shitter? 
[02:25:00]  Call me a faggot.  So that's where she went wrong, Jimmy.  I would guess.  That's where Tiger's wife went wrong.  I think, I just, I'm saying any chick that hot and gentle.  It's like, you know, it's like when you spit in my face and then they get you, there's no juicy, drippy spit.  It's this.  It's like three fucking really bright white flecks of stinky spittle.  It's dry mouth spittle.  There you go.  Hey, thanks a lot for your fucking toothy blowjob.  You gotta have another grape.  Fucking asshole. 
[02:25:30]  Have a grape and make yourself puke.  Watch it move down your neck like a bow eating a pig.  You gotta have a little of that in the relationship.  I need that.  Everybody needs that.  But usually chicks that are that beautiful.  Why don't chicks understand that?  Now, she could be the best fuck on earth.  But in general.  After that.  You have to be honest.  I don't know.  I mean, she may be a dirty girl.  But I'm saying usually chicks like that don't have to work to get a guy.  So they don't know what it's like to have a guy disinterested and sitting there.  They don't know how to make a guy want to fuck him. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah, it's true.  Beat it.  You got a point.  They don't.  When I'm sitting there with my fucking ape tits sitting on the top, I look like a gorilla  now when I'm nude.  And my fucking tits rest on my stomach.  Get in there and suckle.  A gorilla.  I really do.  I look like an ape.  I sit there with my legs open and my fucking ankles touching.  The great white gorilla.  You just shaved down?  A shaved down gorilla?  I'm a shaved down chimp.  My ankles are touching. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  I sit down with my fucking heels together and my fucking mediocre dick and my fat stomach  and my tits resting on it.  Get in there and suck.  Suck my nurse on my bosoms.  Like that?  He's got pictures up.  Exactly like that.  Just a big dumb gorilla.  Oh, shit.  Tits on his stomach.  And Psychotic says, isn't Jesse Ventura sneaking around and about to expose the Tiger Woods conspiracy?  Conspiracy.  Let me tell you, brother. 
[02:27:00]  Trying to take down his popularity.  You think he actually had sex with that many?  Come on.  That never could have happened.  Oswald was a terrible shot.  No, he was a sharpshooter.  I don't know what I'm talking about.  Fuck.  When's the next conspiracy show?  We have a great new bit.  Wednesday night, 10 o'clock.  Wednesday.  All right.  So Thursday, we'll do the new one.  Is it good?  We have a great new bit.  It's so bad.  Is it bad?  It's so bad.  It's great.  It's so fake.  It's so...  Yeah.  It's just full of shit. 
[02:27:30]  Well, let's do the last clip here.  The Jamie Jungers.  This is the clip where she talks about Tiger's dad.  He flew me in.  And we were hanging out.  He got a phone call from his mother.  His father wasn't doing very well.  And he left for a couple hours to go see him.  And came home later on that night.  We made love.  Went to bed.  And then around 2, 3 o'clock in the morning, there was a phone call that his father had passed away. 
[02:28:00]  So I was extremely devastated.  I know he was, too.  So I suck his cock.  I fucking hate her guts.  This piece of garbage.  You didn't make love with Tiger Woods, you piece of garbage.  We made love.  You were a cum dumpster for him, you fucking whore.  And this is what...  You made love.  You didn't fucking make love with Tiger Woods.  This is what it's going to cost for his marriage.  His wife remembers that night.  Like that... 
[02:28:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's not like...  Remember that Tuesday?  Benchmark evening, right.  She remembers the fucking phone call.  Like, because that's...  Your dad's dying.  So Tiger probably called her from the hospital.  Look, I'm just going to go home and sleep.  I'm too sad.  And then he had to call her.  And she knows between that two calls, he fucked this girl.  And she's staying up all night worrying about him, you know, and how he's dealing with the  father thing.  You're right, Jimmy.  That's a fucking...  You're fucking right.  That's the type of shit.  And details like popsicles while watching cartoons.  Yeah.  That's the type of shit that it's just too... 
[02:29:00]  What's the word?  Too...  Personal.  Too personal to...  Because she probably thinks, like, when it's all over, that Tiger's going to, like, ring  her up and go, okay, now it's, uh, you know, it's just you and me now.  Ain't happening.  Fucking...  Ugh.  Worst.  Hot chicks.  Ha, ha, ha.  Whore.  Well, let's see how to foot her.  Footer.  Good morning, boys.  Hi, footer.  Hey, um...  Real quick, you know, I mean, fucking Tiger used to hang out when you went out.  Hold on.  Look at the name there for the Bank of New York Mellon CEO is Robert P. Kelly. 
[02:29:30]  Kelly.  Wow.  Really?  You know what, dude?  You gotta take your money invested.  Boom.  You win some, you lose some.  I happen to lose them all.  Boom.  Sorry, guys.  Robert P. Kelly, the head of a bank.  I saw that.  I do not want to put my money in that bank.  Dude.  You know what, dude?  I'm invested in high heels with a pointy part's up on the front.  So a heel hits the ground, dude.  All these horrible things a bank investment.  Suntan lotion made out of tinfoil, dude. 
[02:30:00]  Like, you know what?  Boom.  You get a tan lotion.  Sorry, footer.  Go ahead, footer.  That's cool.  Again, so, yeah, he hangs out with, when he goes out to, like, the Vegas strip, he goes  out with Jordan.  He goes out with Barkley.  I mean, there's no two, you know, bigger womanizers in, like, sports as far as athletes  go than those two guys.  I mean, they're always, you know, especially Barkley.  He's a fucking strip club whore.  Do you know?  Do you know when Tiger came to see Dice, when I met Tiger that night, and I think it was  2000 or 99, he was gambling with, I think it was Jordan, in Bally's or one of the casinos, 
[02:30:30]  and they said it was rumored that they were both going to come to the show.  We knew before the Tiger was coming, and he actually showed up with an entourage, but  what's his name didn't come?  Jordan didn't come.  Jordan didn't come.  Yeah.  But the fucked up thing is that, I mean, if you look now, in hindsight, of all, like,  the little signals, just like the whole young athlete not having the childhood, hanging  out with Barkley, Jordan, those type of things, I mean, now it's like, oh, fuck, you know  what?  Yeah, I guess he's banging these chicks.  It's kind of part of his, you know, just what he's doing right now. 
[02:31:00]  And then number two point is, these motherfuckers, the media, whether it be another golfer, other  athletes that are coming out against him, they better be fucking careful, man, because shit's  going to come back to bite them in the ass, there's no way they're living these squeaky  clean lives, and to see these cocksuckers come back and, like, chastise fucking Tiger  and shit, you've got to be careful.  They should just shut their mouths.  Wasn't Barkley saying some shit?  I hope not.  Give me the fucking paper.  I think Barkley was saying some shit.  I'm like, Barkley?  Unless it was his choice of women.  Let me see if I got one.  See, this is the problem is, I don't think that Tiger's, like, if he was caught cheating 
[02:31:30]  at golf, I could understand sponsors walking away, or if he's a child molester, or doing something  that we can't comprehend.  And, but, uh, people, what people should do, this is why...  It's that dumb image thing, though, unfortunately.  But people should fucking not, not support the sponsors that walk away from him.  Yeah, I know.  How do we get that done?  You're right.  We can't.  A guy that, that likes fucking?  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Right, right.  It's so stupid.  He did what half those dumb CEOs are doing. 
[02:32:00]  Of course.  In those dumb companies that are dropping.  Absolutely is right.  Let me say to Mike, he thinks this was a plan, which is just the most ridiculous thing I've ever  heard.  Yes, it was.  Mike, explain yourself, please.  Yo, what's going on, boys?  Love you.  Love the show.  All right, I figured this out over the weekend.  This is a big quad that he's had all along.  He never had sex.  He wanted kids.  He didn't want to be an old dad.  He married an old pair.  He had her beautiful jeans to make some beautiful babies.  He bought another house right next to his other house. 
[02:32:30]  This way, when this eventually happened, he could just move them over there.  He could still have all the sex he wants, and he gets to see all the kids.  I mean, you know, traveling around with, you know, the PGA or whatever, I'm sure those  guys never get to see their kids anyway.  So at least this way, you know, he's got somebody taking care of him full time that  loves the kids who's invested in them, and he can do whatever he wants.  What do you think?  You think he planned this whole thing out to destroy his image and lose millions in sponsorship? 
[02:33:00]  Not destroy.  Please.  He's going to get his sponsors back.  He's still the best player.  He's still going to be out there playing.  He took the option to choose his wife over golf just because it's the offseason.  He's not going to be, you know, playing really for a couple months anyway.  He can straighten all the shit out, move her, like I said, move her out, and go back  to playing golf and fucking pitches.  Nah.  I mean...  What's money?  I mean, if he's going to play, he's going to make money.  So it's not a matter of how much money you're losing.  He's still got years and years of making billions, you know, to come. 
[02:33:30]  How is he going to make the billions?  Playing golf.  He's going to go back to playing golf.  He makes way more money from endorsements.  Yeah.  He'll get them.  Endorsements is where his money is.  So he has to...  America's got short attention.  Oh, yeah.  Nobody even remembers that we outed, you know, CIA operatives and stuff.  I mean, you know, those are big things.  This is Tiger getting laid.  Big deal.  Yeah.  The sponsorships will definitely come back.  I agree with you there.  The ones, especially for sporting activity stuff like...  And that's Nike and fucking the golf.  And that's why he had to walk away to go, look what I'm doing, you know, to repair this 
[02:34:00]  damage.  I'm walking away from what I love to do.  It's the only way he can do it.  And then he rebuilds from, you know, from nothing like he has to do anyway.  We like a comeback.  But at least it shows that he did something about what we're all talking about.  That's right.  Sure.  He's the hero.  Thank you, Mike.  He did the right thing.  He chose his wife.  Yeah, because if he continues playing golf, people are like, what the fuck?  You know, but now at least as Americans, we go, okay, he did something about it.  You know what I mean? 
[02:34:30]  And that's all it takes to get back on top again.  Just think, though, the first time out.  It's not...  Do you think, wow, do you think all this negative publicity is affecting his game?  Like, if he plays really poorly or really well, they'll be like, it's amazing he can  still play with all the distractions from that scandalistic...  It's all they're going to talk about.  The spectators are going to be just complete assholes.  I'm telling you, I've been to enough events.  They're not going to let this go.  If he plays really well, they'll go, wow, imagine if he wasn't doing that stuff, how good  he would have been.  Or if he plays poorly, the distractions, he won't be able to... 
[02:35:00]  Nothing will make sense.  He's got to be thinking about some pussy right about now.  Hey, why don't you just put some hair around that hole?  But you know, folks, time X what?  Yeah, this guy will be golfing so much, he'll have more than 18 holes to deal with.  Oh, unfunny comic guy.  Let's go to Jason in Texas.  Jason.  Yo, what's up, boys?  Thanks.  Listen, let me ask you a question.  Does this fucking whore realize how she's fucking completely ruined her own life for the rest 
[02:35:30]  of time?  There is no way anybody else is ever going to want to lay with this bitch because they're  all going to be fucking petrified that she's going to spill the beans on them.  They'll be more likely to fuck her because she fucked Tiger, dude.  I know what you're saying.  People don't think that way.  People just...  If people thought that logically, Tiger would have been fucking eight condom guy.  I'm just telling you, she's fucking completely ruined herself for the rest of the rest.  You got to check out the Jonathan Ross interview.  You know Jonathan Ross, that BBC comic? 
[02:36:00]  I know the name.  You got to check out the BBC America and check out Jonathan Ross.  He did a whole 15 minutes on Tiger Woods the other night.  I think you'll think it's hilarious.  I don't want to hear it.  Not to be a dick, but because I'm doing material on Tiger, so I don't want to see what anybody  else is doing to me.  I have not watched one comic do Tiger stuff.  I don't want to know.  But thank you, though.  I'm sure it's funny.  Even the black comic?  You're way more original than that guy, but I got you.  All right, Jason.  Yeah, I just want to be influenced.  You're fucking away with that with a sister.  Hey, the Charles Barkley thing is kind of interesting because it comes from Phil Mushnick, and you 
[02:36:30]  know how Mushnick...  What did he say?  How bad Tiger is?  Oh, he's the worst.  Mushnick stinks.  What a horrid name.  He's fucking a bore.  Mushnick.  What a goody two-shoes.  I like golfers who don't have sex.  Asshole.  Shut up.  Did he say that?  I don't even know.  I like golfers who don't.  I like to fuck his beard.  I like to fold Phil Mushnick's neck fat over and fuck his beard.  And use his ear as his asshole. 
[02:37:00]  I want to fuck his beard like a vag and use his ear as his asshole.  And I'm going to say I'm going to give you a fucking lobe full of Mushnick.  Take some Mushnick in your fucking ears.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Fold that neck fat over.  Like I'm passing down.  Fuck his face.  Stupid beard.  Holy shit.  How much would you love to do that?  His upper lip is scraping over your helmet.  He's miserable. 
[02:37:30]  Of course he is.  He hates it.  Mushnick.  Yeah.  Take some Mushnick on your chin.  That's actually the stink that builds up between my ball and my left thigh.  I have Mushnick.  It comes from when skin tags fall off by your balls.  When skin tags fall off, you get Mushnick.  It's a fungus that grows where ball skin tags used to be.  Okay, sir.  It's just Mushnick.  That's right.  We can cure that with a little penicillin and this salve.  It's kind of like psoriasis, but on your scrotum. 
[02:38:00]  That's what we call Mushnick.  Mushnick.  Yes.  Does it smell really bad when you have it?  It gives off a cheesy, foul odor.  It's like eczema, but it's got a cheesy, foul odor.  It's like eczema if it was an open wound.  I have festering Mushnick.  Well, you should have pulled those skin tags off immediately, sir.  They chafe.  The way it happens is when you get a cluster of skin tags between your ball and left thigh, 
[02:38:30]  if you pull them off with pliers, the metallic residue mixes with your ball sweat and the  open wound, and the stink is a Mushnick.  So I would leave Mushnick on his chin as I folded his face skin over and fucked it and  came into his ear.  Holy shit.  Take that, Phil.  That is a horrible affliction.  I know.  Nobody wants ball Mushnick.  Phil's got four or five articles on this Tiger Woods.  Of course he does.  I don't even know which one to read.  Let me read this one. 
[02:39:00]  It's the shortest one.  Capitalizing like everybody else.  It's about Barkley.  Although we try to be sensitive to all social affliction, sex addiction, as identified in  Tiger Woods and other celebs, must be a rich man's disease.  It seems that if you're a wealthy, immature, and spoiled brat accustomed to getting what you  want, when you want it, such symptoms fit the profile of a sex addict.  But if you're not rich, and you try to pick up any and every woman in the room, you're  more commonly known as a pig.  That's not a bad point. 
[02:39:30]  But again, he's coming from the point of view where he thinks it's all wrong, I think.  For a Mushnick.  Yeah.  Whatever the Woods saga brought, last week there was nothing more perverse than listening  as Charles Barkley on TNT condemned the media for daring to expose his Nike buddy Tiger  as a creep.  Oh, okay.  Most of us have a lot in common with Barkley because we both think of the world as unfair.  But most of us think the world is unfair because people such as Barkley are able to sustain  their positions and privileges no matter what.  No, that's not why we think it's unfair. 
[02:40:00]  Charles Barkley is telling you what you are, is a fucking, as the media as a whole, you  holier-than-thou asshole, you're taking his wife's humiliation.  It's a non-story.  The story is he had an accident, there was a domestic squabble because that's when legalities  get into it, and was the police were called.  He didn't cheat at golf, so it's a non-story, you cunt.  Barkley is right.  Well.  Fucking vultures.  Mushnick tried to explain that point with this. 
[02:40:30]  If, for example, we had no sense of consequences and engaged in 24-hour instant pleasure-seeking  and gratification.  If we had drinking issues, a profound gambling problem, and a recent DUI arrest while preparing  to have sex with an apparent hooker at 1.30 a.m., could we remain a fully entitled, nationally  televised social critic?  What the fuck?  Well, critic.  That's all the stuff that happened to Barkley, and he was able to keep his job, is basically 
[02:41:00]  what Mushnick is trying to say here.  But that's a rarity.  Most guys that get in trouble don't have their cushy jobs in media.  You mean like Marv Albert, who's also in the media?  Maybe he's not a social critic?  Or how about this, you phony fuck?  Well, Marv Albert lost his gig for a while.  I know, he shouldn't have, and he's back now.  Yeah, of course.  Imus lost his gig for a while.  It happens all the time when these guys end up losing their gigs.  But how about how the New York Times...  Barkley did skate, but that was a rarity.  The New York Times, well, he should have skated.  It had nothing to do with his fucking ability to broadcast.  I agree with you.  But there's... 
[02:41:30]  All right, whatever.  It's the whole Imus thing all over again.  The New York Times doesn't mind giving away troop positions or shit like that.  But boy, when those motherfuckers had to protect one of their own, when one of their own was  in danger of a reporter, they sat on that fucking story, and nobody talked about it because  they were worried about the reporter's safety, which I think is fine.  But they're just very fucking protective of their own.  Fuck Mushnick, man.  Charles Barkley is an athlete.  He's not a social critic.  He's a fucking athlete who happens to know a lot about sports. 
[02:42:00]  And he's a funny, interesting guy who says...  Who gives a shit what he's doing when he's not on TV?  He says funny, interesting things.  Who gives a fuck?  That's why I like him.  That's why I like Barkley.  And he just finishes.  What percentage of those lectured by Barkley about right from wrong are better people than  he?  What percentage would still be employed had they duplicated Barkley's behavior?  How many could get five days off from work to spend in jail?  Oh, Mushnick's a mess. 
[02:42:30]  A lot of people could.  A lot of people could.  Because what he's paid for is being an athlete who has opinions.  Do you understand?  We don't...  I don't hold these guys up.  Maybe Mushnick is such a fucking dumb cuck that he needs other men to form his opinion  for him.  But I don't.  So I don't care.  I can make a judgment on a guy.  I agree with him or disagree with him.  I don't give a fuck what he does in his personal life.  Because I don't look at somebody whose personal life is fucked up and go, well, I can't listen  to him about basketball.  It's not my fucking business, Phil. 
[02:43:00]  Cares.  Little bitch.  This holy attitude about TV has got to go away.  It just sickens me.  This is shit.  They throw garbage at us through the TV every day.  It's just shit.  Yeah.  So why do we have these high standards for the people that throw the shit at us?  And has Phil...  He writes for the Post, right?  Yeah.  Has Mushnick commented on how there are other stories and soldiers being killed?  Why is...  This paper that I work for, front page fucking news with Tiger Woods as broads every day. 
[02:43:30]  Why is this story being perpetuated and sensationalized by this new...  Every day.  Of course he wouldn't.  The same as that ugly, phony bitch Linda Stacey.  They will not call out the exact people they work for for capitalizing on awful things.  And again, I got no problem with the Post doing that.  It's a business.  They're selling papers.  That's fine.  But if you're going to make editorials, it'd be fucking accurate.  Don't try to then have some kind of morality.  Ah, you phony. 
[02:44:00]  Don't take your paycheck, scumbag.  Say you don't want your paycheck until the Post begins to fucking act like the New York  Times or another newspaper.  Yeah.  And doesn't sensationalize this type of piggish behavior.  Exactly.  Make a good perk.  Good for Barkley.  Fuck the media.  Odorous is here from Guar.  I'm doing red-eye with him tonight.  I've actually never met him.  Odorous is here again.  Oh, Jesus.  We're going to say hi to Odorous from Guar in a few minutes.  He's doing red-eye with Jim Norton tonight.  Yes, he is.  Before we wrap up the Tiger Woods stuff for this break anyway.  Sorry I'm so preachy. 
[02:44:30]  He, um, by the way, uh, Odorous does go on red-eye with the entire regalia, doesn't he?  Yeah.  I've never seen that.  You don't see that.  Like, they ask him serious questions.  And he answers his big monster character.  Yeah, with the big, huge fucking penis thing.  It's insanely funny and ridiculous to see.  The penis thing is below the desk, so.  Yes, of course.  So we're all safe.  Uh, here's a Tiger Woods parody that will just, it's horrendous.  Where's it from?  Oh, no.  What do you mean?  You can't.  It's horrendous. 
[02:45:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, where did this come from?  Driving up into a tree.  Tried to hide my romances.  My wife found out, beat the crap out of me.  Took more strokes than my hardest part five.  So many times, it happened so fast.  I don't like the movie, it's a real line. 
[02:45:30]  You get a call from your mistress.  Yeah.  Come get your number to some cheap piece of ass.  Unless you want to f*** up your life.  It's the way of a tiger and she's ready to smash.  Hold your car windows with a line item.  And the neck turns, he finds her husband cheating again.  She won't stop till she chops off the ball of a tiger. 
[02:46:00]  I'll give him his voice.  Yeah, I'd like to have some range.  You need to do me a huge favor.  Take your name off your voicemail.  That's so stupid.  My wife found out.  And boy, is she pissed.  Holy crap.  I think she's coming after me right now.  It's the life of a tiger and she's ready to fight.  Adding billions of dollars to her freedom.  And the neck turns, he finds her husband cheating again. 
[02:46:30]  She won't stop till she chops off the back of a tiger.  It's a parody.  Yeah, it's not bad, man.  It's topical.  The lyrics are okay.  It sounds too much like Eye of the Tiger, though.  You know, it is ironically enough.  And this is very ironic.  I'm not a big fan of the parody. 
[02:47:00]  I'm really not.  At least he wasn't shoehorning, though.  Right.  No shoehorning.  A little shoehorning, but not that bad.  Not much, though.  Not much.  And you could understand what he was saying.  And he had a good range in his voice.  A lot of people saying Abu.  To be able to sing that song alone is very high.  Look, guys.  I'm not saying I liked it.  Tiger and Rachel are both reportedly in Palm Beach, Florida. 
[02:47:30]  That's the headline today.  From TMZ.  Who is this spiky-haired fucking fruit on Fox with this fucking dumb leather jacket?  It looks like me in Down and Dirty.  I can't even criticize the outfit.  He's one of Harvey's guys.  He's one of Harvey Levin's guys.  Oh, fuck that fucking culture.  He's one of the TMZ guys.  Harvey Harvey.  See, now they're making a big deal that Tiger and Rachel are both reportedly in Palm Beach, Florida.  Look at that spiky hair on him.  How fucking enraging.  Is that?  Patrice had the best description.  Planned messiness.  Yes.  Planned messiness.  And that was a brilliant description of what this asshole's hair looks like. 
[02:48:00]  I fucking hate hair like this.  TMZ guy.  Why is that a story that one of the mistresses and Tiger are in the same fucking part of Florida?  The odds are 1 in 48 if they're on the continental United States.  Fucking cunt TMZ.  Fucking Harvey has shown that it's all in good fun sipping his big beverage.  What a prick.  What the fuck, man?  This thing has legs.  This thing has legs.  When you see pictures of it, like they're showing them on the news, it's like, oh my God, that's the guy. 
[02:48:30]  He was the guy.  You never thought.  He was the perfect sipping his big beverage.  He's his.  Harvey.  Yeah, look at him.  Ah, he's working on the phone, smiling with his good calves.  Harvey Levin has good calves, I'll say that.  Fucking despise him.  Right now, his name should just be Los Angeles, because he reminds me of everything I fucking hate in L.A.  His shitty smile and his fucking, his just self-congratulatory laugh and, you know, just a bunch of boys having fun, but covering up what a scumbag he really is. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah.  I'm babbling.  I'm sorry.  Not at all.  I mean, really, I'm babble fest today.  That's all right.  Let's take a break and get Odorous in here, all right?  I got to take a leak.  Yeah, we'll do that.  Stay there.  O.B. and Anthony, Jim Norton, who's going to be on Red Eye with Odorous from GWAR.  Yep.  Speaking of which, here comes Odorous.  Eurungus, entering the studio. 
[02:49:30]  You can barely enter.  Hey, how you doing?  And everyone at SiriusXM very mad that Odorous is here, because he fucked up the green room.  Oh.  With his costume that smells.  It's not a costume.  This is white formal wear for a scum dog of the universe.  Now, this would be for me, right?  Yeah, yeah.  My rectum is wrecked.  I've been out for three and a half months, and there has been no shortage of things up my butthole.  So, let me just kind of get this thing on here.  Oh, hey.  Well, thanks, guys. 
[02:50:00]  First of all, let me say, I can't believe you had me back.  Thank you.  I know.  Nobody does that.  Nobody ever invites me back.  We're amazed, too, to tell you the truth.  And I forgot, what is that called, dear?  Oh, this is the Cuttlefish of Cthulhu, of course.  Right, right.  Yeah, this is what we were, last time I was on the show, you'll remember one of your interns desperately working this shaft, desperately cranking my ham crank here, trying to summon a load up out of it. 
[02:50:30]  And, you know, I've been jacking off all morning trying to get it ready to go.  And I think I'm about ready to go with Old Faithful right here.  Is it ready to?  Yeah, in fact, we have one of your interns that's going to serve as a human cum dumpster.  He's going to do his impersonation of one of Tiger Woods' fucking girlfriends, I think, or something like that.  I think it's Graham, who's a big GWAR fan, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Come on in, Graham.  What's wrong with that, dude?  Graham, get in here.  Yeah, I remember we tried this last time.  It didn't work too well.  Oh, here you go.  Now, get that towel. 
[02:51:00]  We don't want to ruin the studio.  There you go.  Now, kneel.  Why is he putting a towel on his head, Anthony?  He's kneeling his head.  He's got a towel at the show last night.  Against his face.  Okay, now touch it.  But there's a hole in the towel.  Oh, yeah.  Squeeze it.  He's squeezing this big...  Oh, wait a minute.  Oh, yeah.  He just...  Oh, yeah.  Oh, oh, oh.  I'll get this whipped cream in the penis.  Oh, yeah.  He's getting all over Graham's face. 
[02:51:30]  Let me see, Graham.  Let's see.  Graham.  Wow, how does that feel?  Wow.  The liver?  That's a steamy load.  And you like this, Graham?  Oh, Tiger.  Graham, you're into this or what?  I'm left already, huh?  Why is Graham into getting...  Tiger, your father's dying.  Oh, yeah.  Let me pop this load.  Hold on a second.  Oh, what'd you say?  Oh, fuck that.  Now you got whipped cream all over you.  All right.  I ruined your studio, but, you know, that's okay.  We got a through the cum shot part.  That's okay.  Now, what's all that other riffraff hanging down?  I don't know, dude.  I've been on tour now for three and a half months. 
[02:52:00]  We just wrapped up everything last night at Irving Plaza here in New York.  Oh, you're done?  I'm all done for now.  It's been a brutal, brutal, brutal tour.  Last night, it was definitely...  Going to the show was like going down to a plane of hell.  The first song, the barricade broke.  So all these people were just in this bloody fucking mess.  The fucking security guards were trying to put their feet against the barricade to get  it back up.  Then people kept flying over them and hitting them in the legs.  It was a fucking disaster.  Hilarious.  Actually, it's funnier to look at the audience than look at the band, which is hard to believe. 
[02:52:30]  It sounds like it.  You're on Red Eye tonight.  Yeah, that's another really weird thing that happened.  You know, I was here in town scoring crack or something, and he called me up and he's  like, when's the next time you're in New York?  We'd love you to do the show.  I'm like, I'm in New York right now.  And so I just went over there and, you know, met Bill O'Reilly.  And the next thing I knew, they're calling me their freaking intergalactic correspondent.  They didn't even ask me.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:53:00]  They put that on the screen.  That's a galactic correspondent.  You have to think that maybe the Mayans were right when Odorous is appearing on Fox News.  Yes.  You know, can the end of the world be far away?  Let's hope so.  I submit yes, no, sure.  But Jim, I understand you're on the show tonight?  You are on today, yes.  Oh, we're going to tear it up.  Last time I was on, Adam Carolla was there.  He was kind of a douche to me.  Was he really?  Yeah.  Yeah, he said he likes Slipknot better.  I mean, those guys are a bunch of costumed clowns. 
[02:53:30]  I mean, I'm really from outer space here.  Come on.  It's not like David Bowie or something.  But anyway, I think I've gotten him around more to my side by the end of the show.  So, yeah, I don't get it at all.  They have me on.  What are you guys talking about tonight?  Don't know yet.  You don't know what you're talking about tonight, Odorous?  Hold on until three or four, I think.  I suppose you're going to do a little Tiger Woods stuff.  I'm sure Tiger will be in there.  What do you got a Tiger Woods?  I have a lot of shit about that.  Are you a golf fan?  Oh, yeah.  A lot of people don't know that Odorous, well, I'm not really very good at golf. 
[02:54:00]  I just pick up the ball and throw it.  What I like about golf is that they encourage drinking.  Yes, yes.  And bikini, scantily clad bikini chicks driving drink carts.  And, you know, basically, I think it's the only professional sport where, you know,  basically you're encouraged to drink on every hole.  Yeah, that or bowling is another drinking sport.  Oh, definitely big drinking sport.  Now, Tiger, now, he doesn't suck down heaters like John Daly does.  No.  But everybody knows Tiger is a partier.  Anyone who watches golf, they have to bleep him constantly. 
[02:54:30]  Really?  He's got a salty, foul mouth.  He has been a player since day one, and everybody knows it.  So, it's like, really, the only thing that's surprising about this to me is that he's so stupid.  You know?  Like, he would leave those pathetic text messages.  Oh, do you think maybe you could take my name off of your caller ID?  It's like, this dumb bitch has got Tiger Woods' name on her caller ID.  Do you think she's going to take it off for anything? 
[02:55:00]  You know how many free drinks that's going to get her?  You know how many diseased fucking bang sticks are going to be jammed in her fucking flapping cooter?  Thousands.  She'll never give up on Tiger.  And Tiger won't give up on her.  Because he loves her.  Like, he loves all the other sluts that he bangs constantly.  Well, the thing was, she wanted, uh...  Tiger wanted her to take her name off the machine.  So that, like, if the wife called, she wouldn't hear her outgoing message going, hi, this is...  Oh, but see, now you're getting me all muddled up with facts in reality. 
[02:55:30]  It's much better if I just make it up.  Yeah.  You know, it's just like, now I'm beginning to think, though, it's all part of some Uber Tiger conspiracy.  Like, he knows full well what he's doing.  And he's getting ready to make some kind of incredible power move.  Maybe this is how he gets into acting.  You know, you're right.  I did just correct a man wearing a giant whipped cream penis with fucking monster feet.  And a monster face.  And I corrected him on the facts. 
[02:56:00]  We could have done this without the costume, I'm thinking.  Because it's radio.  They don't know you're wearing a costume.  But, you know...  You're dressed up for us.  I appreciate that.  I just love it, you know.  I love to do a show, play until 2 in the morning, stumble back to the hotel, don't even get a shower,  because I'm so filthy and disgusting.  Then wake up at 7 in the morning, put all this shit on, and come over here.  And I wanted to mention that because your costume stinks.  And I'm not...  I know, and that's usually why people don't ask me back.  I don't really care about smells for the most part, but this costume fucking rakes. 
[02:56:30]  Well, you...  And you know, they're really pissed off at the reception area.  We should get Kenny in here or somebody that heard...  They want all your stuff out of the green room.  Tell him he has to change back into his regular clothes in the bathroom.  They don't want anything to do with Odorous and Guar at this facility.  Well, it's too bad because we've been up here.  We've changed in that room many times.  We've done many shows here.  And I'm sorry I ruined their green room.  What happened, Kenny?  Kenny heard.  Kenny, I mean...  I heard the last part of it, and I asked Kenny, what the hell's going on? 
[02:57:00]  Well, you're going to have to fumigate this studio when he's done.  Oh, it's...  Ow!  Is it that bad?  It's horrendous.  Well, you know what?  My name is Odorous.  It is.  It is.  See, you're just living up to your name, right?  Well, let's make the most of this one, guys, because I doubt I'll be back on the show.  I think it has to do with the whipped cream, perhaps.  Well, that was a request.  Someone told me that you guys were demanding a co-shot.  It's fine.  The whole thing's fine.  What was the problem they have with the green room, though?  None whatsoever.  I came in there. 
[02:57:30]  I did my deal.  I rolled.  No, no, Kenny.  Odorous.  He's a smelly son of a bitch from outer space.  Yes.  We're going to tell you what they said about you after you left.  Oh.  That's what I'm getting at.  Oh, okay.  What happened?  No, they called the maintenance workers and facilities and the cleanup crew, and they're  down there cleaning up because he spread out all his gear because, I guess, it was out  of order from his show last night.  Yeah.  And he just stunk up the whole place, and that's where they put, like, real celebrities  that, like, real celebrities. 
[02:58:00]  Odorous isn't a real celebrity?  I've come here to be insulted then, haven't I?  That's great.  I stink up the room, and I'm not a celebrity.  That's wonderful.  Oh, and this is a costume as well.  Well, that was me.  I'm sorry.  That's okay, guys.  You know, what can I say?  I've made a career out of destroying and stinking up places.  How do you dry clean?  Do you dry clean that or launder?  Yeah, just send me the bill.  Send Sleazy P. Martini the bill, you know?  God, it doesn't stink any worse than half the shows on this network. 
[02:58:30]  I'm trying to think what else you guys would talk about on Red Eye.  I mean, the tiger's the big thing.  What else is going on?  Yeah, we're getting rid of them.  I don't know what.  They usually send me a point sheet.  Like, they send me about, like, 20 things they want to talk about, and then they have  me, like, get back to them, like, five or six times throughout the day as they go through  everything I potentially could screw up.  Yes.  And then, when I get on the show, they only ask me, like, two or three things out of the  whole list.  So, basically, I have to spend the whole day doing homework for questions that I don't 
[02:59:00]  even get asked.  But, this does kind of control it a little bit, and I don't get such potty mouth.  And the thing I have trouble with is the delay.  That screws with me, big time.  Down you downstairs, you mean?  Well, when I do it, I do a lot of facilities.  Like, when I'm on tour, I'll, like, be in Vegas, and I'll do it from the Vegas facility  or whatever, and then the five-second delay, like, when people are sitting there on the  going, you know, and you know the guy's heard the question, but he hasn't said anything yet.  I just, I deliver a joke, and nobody laughs, and I'm like, oh, I'm not funny anymore. 
[02:59:30]  But then, five seconds later, I'm like, I didn't do anything, and they're laughing.  It's just very confusing.  Maybe they are laughing at you.  They all are laughing.  Maybe the joke wasn't funny, and then they are just laughing at you.  Yeah, it's more like the nervous, just, oh, is he going to leave?  No, but, like, once again, they keep asking me back.  Did they throw you downstairs in the newsroom down there during that?  Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, I met Bill O'Reilly, and, well, I saw him running away from me, 
[03:00:00]  actually, screaming as he locked himself into his dressing room.  But the reason I stink so bad right now, why are you looking at men on your Facebook page?  He's way gay looking.  Good point, Danny, why?  Danny, comment?  Well, the thing is, I was in here before, and I was, oh, I'm sorry, I just asked him a question  and cut him off.  Hey, um, I was in before.  Do you want the answer to the question?  I was acceptably stinky before.  I'm just going to watch.  I just watch.  I was, was I this, did I smell this bad before, guys?  No, not last time.  Yeah, it's the whole tour.  I mean, we just rocked the house, and, like, I played, like, 80 shows in the last three 
[03:00:30]  and a half months.  That's a tour's worth of sweat in that.  Yeah, sweat, blood and cum.  You're washing it all hard to wash, right?  Excuse me?  It's hard to wash.  How do you wash it?  Yeah, I just walked through a car wash, one of those automated ones.  Not responsible for shoulder swords.  Yeah, well, it made it through the whole thing, and, uh, you know, that's a good thing.  It's like, yeah, we can only build so many armored suits, so it held up pretty damn well.  It was a great tour, and now we're getting ready to go savage the Europeans for a few months,  so.  Oh, you're going over there. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah, well, we're going to be working on some stuff in the studio for a while, and actually  I've got some pretty exciting projects.  Basically, what I'm trying to do is, uh, since no one really let me on television except for  Red Eye, I'm going to start my own television station.  That's why GWAR is starting its own web-based television station, very similar to what Tom  Green has been doing for the last few years.  Yes, indeed.  I want to have, basically, my own network, my own talk show.  Basically, it will be like a muscular dystrophy telethon, except it'll be to pay off my giant 
[03:01:30]  crack debt.  And they'll help odorous pay off Sleazy Pee Martini.  I'll have singing, dancing, ritual, animal butt sex, you know, camel dicks.  Uh, we won't talk about Tiger, unless we want to, of course.  And, uh, so I'm going to be doing that for a while, but yeah, after that, we're going  to go to Europe.  They actually invited us, um, and we're going to be there for a couple months, so doing those  big festivals over there.  Those people take their metal very, very, very seriously.  Oh, yes.  Yes, they do.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:02:00]  I mean, if you've, if you're familiar with the, uh, phenomena of the European patch jacket,  you know, the denim vest with every single fucking dusty ass metal band that ever was,  except Saxon, you know, uh, what's another good one?  Uh, I don't know.  Motherhead.  Well, no, that's not, that's even way better.  But, you know, it's just like every obscure weird metal band, like, oh, for instance, Manowar.  You're familiar with Manowar, right?  Over here, maybe two, three hundred people.  Over in Europe, 10,000, 12,000 people, they go to the stage riding Harleys. 
[03:02:30]  They go up on these ramps, they ride Harleys onto the stage.  So it's, it's, it's a completely different world up there.  And also, the same thing is happening in Canada.  People in Canada support the music scene so much more.  We go up to Canada, we play in Edmonton, not a big city by any standards, and, you know,  there'll be 1,500, 1,600 people there.  For some reason, these Euro fucks support music, and there's, hey, that guy's good.  He's got his patch jacket up already. 
[03:03:00]  That's fucking awesome.  You see that?  You like Anvil?  Oh, well, you know, I saw that movie, and, you know, I appreciate what they're doing,  because in a lot of ways, they reminded me of us, but, you know, just in their dogged determination.  But, damn, you know, it's just like they're not really all that good or all that funny.  And it was more pathetic, I thought, than anything else, especially when that producer dude is like,  I've got this chance to go to England and work with this producer.  No, that producer is jacking you for 15,000 pounds. 
[03:03:30]  That's not dollars.  That's pounds.  So you can go over there and record an album in his basement.  I thought that was the saddest part of the whole thing, but I'm very, very happy for them,  and the success they have.  I hope they fucking make a million dollars or whatever it is they're in it for, because  it's great.  Anybody who works that hard for something, it's good to see them finally realize their success.  You are right.  It's like, I hate to say it, but, like, they're doing very well now, but they're not that good.  They're not.  They're not. 
[03:04:00]  They're kind of terrible.  But you had a reason they didn't make it.  Do you understand, fucking Motorhead's last album, Motorizer, is better than stuff they  put out 20 years ago.  Yeah, Motorhead is one of those few metal bands that actually continues to be just as powerful  and awesome as they ever were.  And it's kind of scary, because as we get further into the history of metal, you know,  more and more of the heavyweight bands are going, like, the route of Metallica.  Now, Metallica will always bring it live.  They will always tear your fucking head off live.  But, come on, they haven't done a good album in so freaking long. 
[03:04:30]  And I know this is an obvious target.  Everyone bangs on them, but it's the biggest one.  It's like, every time they make an album, it's like, this is the heavy one.  We're getting back to the heavens.  Like, that's what you said about the last one.  And it's like, no acts are coming forward to replace these bands.  Did you not like that?  I actually liked that last album a lot.  You didn't like the last one yet.  No, I didn't.  I didn't like it at all.  I found it, for instance, the video.  You know, I judge things on stupid reasons a lot.  But, you know, it's just like, when I watch the video, it's like seven minutes long.  There's all these zombies, this amazing computer animation. 
[03:05:00]  And not one second of the band is involved.  And I'm like, you know what?  The band did not have one thing to do with the production of this video.  There's were other artists coming in there.  You know, we fucking take every penny that we've got and just somehow make the stuff.  And, you know, if Gwai had one ounce of the resource that, like, these bands bring and these companies dump into these things for these lame, half-fucking-baked concepts,  it's like, we would make a movie.  We would make the world fucking rock.  But, uh...  Oh, that was so lame. 
[03:05:30]  We would make the world rock.  Oh, my God.  You can kick me off right now.  I want to ask Danny about Metallica.  Is Odorous right about Metallica?  Because Danny's a big Metallica fan.  Well, I just haven't dug their shit.  Let me see what Danny has to say.  Well, I did feel that their last release, it felt very forced.  Yeah.  And I think that, with all the backlash they got from releasing St. Anger, I think they went into this album thinking that, like, they...  Like, overdoing it, saying, you know, we have to get back to our metal roots, but I don't even think that they remember what those are anymore. 
[03:06:00]  So they were just trying to, like, sew together, like, really hard riffs one after another.  And, uh, none of those songs feel like they have any...  Like, I don't listen to any of those songs and go, oh, man, that's an awesome song.  It's hard as fuck.  I don't think they're awesome songs.  I liked a lot of Cyanide a lot, and I liked, uh, uh, This Was Just Your Life.  I liked that one, too, a lot.  They're not bad, but it doesn't...  To me, it just doesn't feel...  Like, you put on, like, Ride the Lightning, and you start listening to, like, for little belt holes, like, you feel...  You're like, fucking A, you know, and that's the kind of shit you get into.  I don't feel like that with the new stuff. 
[03:06:30]  I'm not saying it's not bad.  Were they at least in the studio at the same time for this album?  Or did they do their parts separately?  You know what?  I don't even know.  Well, yeah, I think they actually worked together.  The old producer I worked with told me about this, uh, the band, Yes.  They were actually hating each other so much, they could not be on the same continent with each other while they were working on this record.  Because the guy was like, I'm not going to be in the same continent, because he could show up at the studio and try to change my track.  So it was just like, you know, it's just like, there's just nobody stepping up to replace the Metallicas and the Slayers and the Motorheads. 
[03:07:00]  What about Lamb of God?  Well, Lamb of God, we just did a half of this tour with Lamb of God, and they're a great band.  And they're also old buddies of ours from Richmond, Virginia.  But, you know, do I think they're the next Led Zeppelin?  Do I think they're the next Pantera?  No.  You know, I don't see, you know, as, you know, they're Lamb of God, and they're an awesome band.  But where is the successor to bands like Metallica that have just dominated metal for so long? 
[03:07:30]  And then you throw up bands like, I mean, I'll say Lamb of God of all the new bands out there, that's probably the best one.  But then you get these bands like Trivium.  Okay, I don't know if you guys are Trivium fans or not, but there's just, I mean, those guys,  their parents bought them a freaking tour bus, and, you know, they just suck out loud,  and it's just like, you know, I'm always looking for something more in music.  And then the new Slayer album comes out, and it's just like, kind of like, okay,  it sounds basically exactly like every other record you fucking made.  And it's like, metal's got to grow, it's got to do new things, 
[03:08:00]  and it's harder and harder to do that all the time,  because how many times can you polish a turd?  You know, it's just like, it's always going to be a guitar, like, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  So, it's very, very difficult to come up with new and original stuff.  That's why, again, I know I'm very biased with Motorhead,  but it's amazing to me that this fucking new album was,  as Runaround Man, the opening tune, is fucking so heavy,  and it's just three guys.  It's fucking three guys, and they always put out something good, man.  It's possible to do, but it's just not easy. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah, well, Lemmy has just been unrepentant about his lifestyle from day one.  There's no hypocrisy about him.  He, you know, we went over to his apartment in Hollywood,  and after he showed us his gigantic collection of Nazi memorabilia,  he fucking laid out a huge line of crystal meth and ate a steak.  He did this huge line of fucking crack,  and then ate a fucking, like, you know, 16-ounce porterhouse.  I was just like, whoa!  I mean, I don't know if they were really his teeth, probably not, 
[03:09:00]  but, yeah, he's been a meth head his entire life, and he's proud of it.  You know, he's like, this works for me.  I believe that's what a Motorhead is.  Yeah.  I mean, is he still living that, though?  I don't know.  I've heard he fucking really is not supposed to say it.  My bus driver just finished a Motorhead tour.  Those guys, he said, basically, they party all night.  Many nights, he would find Lemmy in the lounge,  where he was sitting the night before,  passed out at the table, a bottle of Jack Daniels in one hand,  and a Marlboro in the other. 
[03:09:30]  And basically, he just wakes up, boom, he's at it again.  Yeah, he's amazing.  His writer, his dressing room, he likes to have a big bottle of Jack  and sour cream and onion potato chips.  Anything healthy isn't allowed within 40 feet of his dressing room.  I'm a firm believer in whatever makes you happy makes you healthy.  A lot of these doctors or whatever,  they tell us to put all this shit in our bodies or not to do this and that.  Honestly, I've never noticed a fucking ounce of difference.  Anything I've ever, you know, besides eating baby brains  and drinking the tears of children, you know, 
[03:10:00]  my diet is pretty horrible and I'm still pretty svelte.  Well, you've got the situation happening.  Well, I just paint on my six-pack, which is pretty good.  You paint on your situation.  Yeah, it's like, yeah, I should sell this thing.  Odorous is six-pack abs, two seconds.  I hope that looks better from the stage.  Yeah, it's a little rough.  I hope the lights on the stage help those abs a little more.  Yeah, an old girlfriend of mine actually thought I was kind of ripped down there  and she's like, where'd they go?  I'm like, eh, shut up, put it in your mouth.  They're not here to talk. 
[03:10:30]  Right on.  Very good, Odorous.  Well, thanks for having me back, guys.  I want to see Red Eye this evening.  Yes.  Jimmy Norton.  I know Odorous from Red Eye.  We've never met until today, but I see him on Red Eye and he's funny.  Very funny, man.  Yeah, I don't know what happened to me today.  You're fine, you're fine.  Odorous is fine.  Hell yeah.  Well, yeah, we're on Red Eye tonight.  I'm looking forward to a big show and all that crap.  Do we have to see some Odorous video before we go?  No.  I want to see some Guar video.  Guar.  I do.  I love to look at myself. 
[03:11:00]  How long have you guys been together?  Well, we de-thawed in Antarctica 25 years ago and we've been, you know, pummeling the  music community ever since then.  And that's another great thing you can say about Guar is we never stop.  You know, a lot of bands will take, like, for instance, the Misfits, who has just become  like a, just a debacle, a debacle of what they once used to be.  I mean, they've stopped doing it for 13 years and then they put out another album.  They say it's our 30th anniversary.  It's like, come on.  This is our 25th anniversary.  We've been on this planet for a quarter of a century doing this shit. 
[03:11:30]  Oh, this is one of our political numbers. 
[03:12:00]  We've got so many of them, though.  It's like, why hide with them?  You're not going to blow them up every now and then.  You like Old Merciful Fate?  Oh, hell yeah.  I'm a huge King Diamond fan.  He's fantastic.  He's absolutely awesome.  How the fuck do you guys play your instruments?  I don't know how you play with all that shit on you.  I'll tell you, anybody who has a squar and is like, oh, they can't play.  They're just a show band.  Well, they're full of shit. 
[03:12:30]  My guys are some of the most talented musicians in metal.  I mean, you try to play this kind of stuff with a goddamn dinosaur chewing on your scrotum.  And it's like, you know, it's not because we suck that we fucking look like monsters from  outer space.  It's because we want to do the most outrageous show possible.  But the cornerstone of the band is the music.  That's where it all starts.  That's where it all finishes.  If the band didn't rock, we wouldn't have been around for 25 years.  If people are so stupid out there that they're still going, oh, it's just like a joke band. 
[03:13:00]  It's like, then they haven't listened to any of our records, you know?  Do you think Venom was more of a show band where they really weren't great musicians?  Yeah, you know, but I never even thought about the show thing with Venom.  I just loved them so much, you know?  And you know what I'm talking about, Jim?  It's like, there used to be so many great bands like that, you know?  And it's just like, what is happening?  Especially with like the overly manicured facial hair, like stoppy, starty, new metal crap.  I can't stand that shit.  Stoppy, starty.  You know, it's just like so many changes. 
[03:13:30]  And it's just like, there's no riff.  There's no groove.  There's no soul to the music anymore.  Yeah.  It's just like, you got to pick it up, boys.  Odorous is throwing down the gauntlet here.  We don't need this corporate crap rock, daddy bought me a tour bus.  We need, you know, we need the spirit of fucking metal to come back.  We need the spirit of Lemmy's warts to infest children everywhere and start doing crystal meth.  Yeah.  Lemmy's got like those sugar pops on his head.  Dude, he's the fucking great, he opens the show. 
[03:14:00]  He opens the show, are you having a good evening?  And they're like, yeah, well, we'll soon put a stop to that.  We're Motorhead, we're going to clean your clocks.  And they just fucking open up.  There's nothing better than that.  This is not a Barry Manilow concert.  Oh, I should be killed.  We would do anything to play with Motorhead.  It's not, we've met Lemmy a few times.  Actually, he came to Ciguar.  He came backstage.  I was just like stumbling out of my armor.  He looks at me and he goes, I hope I never have to work that hard. 
[03:14:30]  I was like, thanks, Lemmy's the shit.  He's trying to fucking, how good is Mickey D, man?  That drummer is fucking one of the best drummers ever.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, they're just, they would probably be, it's a tough fight, but I would have to say  Motorhead is my favorite all-time metal band.  They've had the most consistently awesome sound.  And the sound of Lemmy's bass is just so freaking amazing.  It's got such a great, just like a growl to it.  It's almost like a guitar, but it's still got that bottom end.  A lot of bass players go for that fuzzy bass tone and they really lose the bottom end  because they think they're playing a guitar.  They're not. 
[03:15:00]  And Lemmy is just, you know, there's few people out there that I will worship as living gods  and he's one of them.  He rules.  He's got, what's his best piece as far as a Nazi memorabilia?  Oh, easily.  His SS camel blankets.  Really?  Gigantic blankets that you put over camels to ride them that have gigantic swastikas and  SS runes on them.  All like embroidered.  Absolutely unbelievable.  Wow.  Nice.  He's got some serious shit. 
[03:15:30]  Like a lot of English people, he's obsessed with history.  And yeah, his collection is vast and truly stupendous.  But he's not a Nazi.  He just, you know, thinks they have cool clothes.  I've always said the snappiest dressed army ever on the face of the earth in any time  period.  Yeah, I saw him wearing, I guess he had a death's head.  What do you have?  A fucking, a nice hat he was wearing in that one shot that Danny pulled up.  Yeah, yeah.  He was wearing an SS officer's helmet there. 
[03:16:00]  It looks like, I mean, a hat.  And it actually has the Schutzstaffel or the death's head.  Look at that.  Now that, the death's head was basically the symbol of the SS.  Yeah.  It was first just used for the guys who ran the death camps, but later everyone liked  it so much they all wanted one.  Yeah, you know, they get jealous with each other, those Nazis.  Like, why did they get the skull?  Look at them.  But I mean, it is pretty wicked, you know.  Let me make some good Nazi.  It looks like it could be a fucking Nazi.  This is like, this is funny, it's like, this is the insignia of our army. 
[03:16:30]  A skull.  You know?  It's like, there's no bullshit.  You know the army's not there to build a school.  Good point, good point.  Absolutely.  How's our war doing?  Have you guys ragged on the war at all?  What's going on with that?  Do you talk about that much?  Well, we got our warmonger president in there now, who's committing more troops.  Yeah.  And I really don't.  There's no way that the United States will ever prevail in Afghanistan militarily.  If anyone knows anything about that country, they have tried to conquer that country now 
[03:17:00]  for centuries.  And no one, from Genghis Khan to Alexander to freaking Gorbachev, you know, no one has succeeded.  And no one ever will.  And it's just like, you know, maybe the fact that like 95% of the world's dope comes from  there has something to do with it.  But I just can't figure it out.  Don't you have any kind of futuristic space weapon where you can help us with?  Yeah, we do.  We have access to all kinds of that shit.  But we are purists in the fact that we just like to use medieval weapons. 
[03:17:30]  It's just much more personal.  Yeah, yeah.  And I can start dropping bombs and, you know, spraying AKs into the crowd.  But when you backhand someone with those gauntlets.  Much, much nicer.  The meaty swack of my syphilitic penis smacking into a braced face.  I'm just knocking the braces out of a child's mouth with my penis.  Fantastic.  We recently played a benefit at Fire Island for gay people who have rotting assholes. 
[03:18:00]  And it was so great.  I was pissing out this stream of cum.  And the gay men were leaping up the cum like they looked like salmon.  It was just like, oh, oh, oh, oh.  After the show, I pulled three retainers, four gold teeth, and eight wads of chewing gum out of my dick slit.  Jesus.  Oh, there you go.  Oh, I love it.  Odorous is going to be on red-eye tonight, believe it or not.  Yes, he is.  On the Fox News channel with Jim Norton.  Good for Gutfeld.  I highly recommend you check it out. 
[03:18:30]  What a fucking...  It's just great to see how the Fox News channel set dressed as that.  It's so fucking funny to see that.  It's amazing.  There's the logo, the TV's behind you, and there's you discussing the events.  Yeah, politics or something.  It's like, the funniest thing is they make me, when I get there, the first thing they do is they run at me with a black wrap and just wrap me up from the waist down.  They're like, just don't basically come anywhere near the building with that thing hanging out.  Yeah, that could be a problem.  Yeah, I think Bill O'Reilly was jealous.  You didn't really meet Bill O'Reilly, did you? 
[03:19:00]  No, no, I lied about that as well.  Yeah, all right.  Yeah, Greg is a great guy.  He's an old-school guard fan.  And, like, for one weird moment last night in the show...  We're laughing, hold on, we're laughing, because there you are with the Fox News channel logo.  There's something just inherently wrong about that.  Or an alien monster.  A lot of hot bitches on that show.  My body was taken from...  Damn, he gets...  Oh, and Greg has the most beautiful wife as well.  He's a great guy.  He even talks.  And, yeah, he's the guy who puts the war back on TV, and that's pretty amazing. 
[03:19:30]  And look how cute I am.  We're working great with the Fox colors.  I like that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It works out pretty good.  Yeah, Greg's a great guy.  Hey, he's funny.  He's funny as hell.  He used to run the Maxim in London, I think.  I read his book about being over there.  I'm actually writing a book right now.  I'm scribbling it in crayon on old pieces of toilet paper, though, so it's kind of not getting there.  But if you go to www.rvanews.com, you can read all the stuff about Guar that you ever didn't want to know. 
[03:20:00]  Because I've got my book I'm getting ready to do, and I guess that was the part where I tried to plug it.  But it's absolutely fucking hilarious.  It tells the whole...  It's called Me, Guar, and the Onrushing Grip of Death.  And it tells the whole story of Guar from the very sickening beginnings to whatever it is that we're doing right now,  though the sickening part has remained consistent.  I forget the name of Grutfeld's first book.  His second one's not out.  It's fucking hilarious.  That's what inspired me, actually, to finally put together all my grotesque stories, was reading Greg's book. 
[03:20:30]  It's about him when he's in England.  Look at that asshole who can do it.  It's very funny.  Of course I can.  Actually, last night I was doing this show, and I looked down in the barricade before it broke,  and there was this one security guard that was stripped to the waist who looked just like Greg.  And for one moment, I thought, why is Greg Gutfeld stripped to the waist in the slam pit at a Guar show?  Probably because he's an alcoholic.  Is he?  Oh, Gutfeld's a drunk.  Does he drink like I'm okay?  We'll be hitting the bars tonight.  He likes his wine. 
[03:21:00]  Does he?  Yeah, we did the show Thursday and went out afterwards.  Does that creep think he's a gentleman?  A lot of drunks will start drinking wine to kind of cover up for the fact that they're completely drunk.  You know, wine supposedly doesn't, like, get you drunk.  That's what Al Jurgensen did.  We talked about him a lot last time.  He's like, yeah, Al doesn't drink anymore, man.  He doesn't do heroin.  He just drinks wine, man.  Yeah, like eight bottles a day.  That still will fuck you up.  Certainly will.  Well, Odorous, we're actually behind on reads now and everything else. 
[03:21:30]  Well, I can see you over there, and yes, and I'm out of here.  We will see you on Red Eye with Jimmy Norton this evening.  Yes, guys, thank you very much for having me back.  Jim, great meeting you.  You too, Odorous.  Send the fumigation bill to Sleazy.  And I promise, if you guys ever have me back on here today, I will bring a new, a brand spanking new armored war suit.  It won't smell at all.  Thank you, sir.  All right, guys.  Odorous.  There goes Odorous.  I'm going to be traveling back. 
[03:22:00]  Because someone gets the door for Odorous.  He can't.  On the carpet.  Look at his head.  What the fuck, Odorous?  His shoulder swords hit everything on his way out.  With his little thong.  Get Iraq in here immediately.  With his little thong.  Where's Iraq?  Yeah, where's Iraq?  Get Iraq in here immediately.  I want Iraq to smell the seat.  He has to smell the seat.  He's pretty much sitting on the seat with fucking...  Get Iraq.  Just his bare ass on the seat.  Just his ass.  Yeah, just his ass.  Just his ass.  Right there on the seat.  I want Iraq to stick his face right on there.  So do I.  And sniff away.  And the seat will go, yuck. 
[03:22:30]  Oh my God, that thing just stinks.  Oh my God, it smells.  He's very entertaining.  Yeah, yeah.  The studio stinks on ice, though.  Wait till the Ronifaz show come in here.  You know it's not going to diffuse.  He just banged into equipment going down the hall.  How does he get anywhere with that?  He's a monster.  How does he fly on the plane with the monster hat?  I don't know.  They wouldn't let him on with those big knives on his shoulders.  That's for sure.  I bet he has to check that. 
[03:23:00]  Yeah, he...  God, Gwarf's been around forever, huh?  All right, let's go to break.  I don't really see him.  No, Iraq?  Where's Iraq?  All right.  MIA.  All right.  MIA?  All right, after the break.  We've got to take a break.  I'm a mightily incompetent asshole.  MIA.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.'s.  You have eight new voice messages.  First voice message.  Hey, this is Ryan from Pennsylvania.  I want to give a big fuck to you to my boss. 
[03:23:30]  They called me first thing in the morning on Monday to let me know that all the bullshit  that he had told me up until now about my paycheck all of a sudden magically just goes  away, and they're going to take back everything that they've paid me for the last few months.  So now, for the next couple months, I'm working for no pay.  Fuck you.  Next message.  Yeah, I want to give a big fuck you to the douche answering the damn phone.  I wanted to say something about Steven Seagal that nobody ever brought up, and it was fucking 
[03:24:00]  hilarious, and the faggot hung up on me.  Fuck you.  Next message.  I just want to say fuck you to my wife after six years telling me she don't love me after  I worked my ass off for her and my two kids.  Fuck you.  Then you tell me you want me back again when I'm finally over you.  Fuck you again.  Next message.  Yeah, I want to give a big fuck you to my wife.  You know I didn't want to have any more children.  You fucking took your IUD out without my approval, and now you're telling me that you miscalculated  the fucking date. 
[03:24:30]  Fuck you.  I don't want any more goddamn kids.  Next message.  Yeah, this fuck you goes out to all you unoriginal dickholes wishing cancer upon everybody.  Get a new line, fuck nut, and I hope you all die of cancer.  Next message.  I would just like to send a big fuck you to the bug-eyed bitch who came to work sick, breathed  in my fucking face, and now I've got the stupid cold.  I hope the next time you get sick it's 80.  Next message.  Yes, this is Governor Ventura. 
[03:25:00]  I would like to give a big fuck you to me for getting my ass handed to me by little Jimmy  Norton.  F me.  F for my face.  F you.  Next message.
