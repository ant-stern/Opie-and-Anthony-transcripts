<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts boasting about their (exaggeratedly described) Cleveland ratings and promoting "Whip-Em-Out Wednesday," a listener contest involving displaying "WOW" signs on vehicles.  A New York City trooper called in reporting several "WOW" signs on a military Humvee on the George Washington Bridge.  The hosts then transitioned to morbidly humorous commentary on the deaths of Dudley Moore and Randy Castillo, interspersed with listener calls about the "WOW" contest and updates on the deaths.

A substantial portion of the show focused on a graphic discussion of the previous night's episode of "The Osbournes," detailing Sharon Osbourne's appearance and actions.  Ozzy Osbourne himself called in, discussing the episode, his neighbor issues, and his daughter's development, including explicit comments about her body and his desire to attend her gynecologist appointments. A listener then called in to advise Ozzy to make his daughter wear a bra.  The show also included segments of "The Oz Game," a vulgar trivia game based on *Oz*, where callers guessed dialogue lines for a chance to win a DVD.  The hosts announced Rich Voss's upcoming in-studio appearance and mentioned Ozzy Osbourne's refusal to take a photo with Russell Yates.

The "Oz Game" continued, featuring numerous vulgar and sexually explicit answers and several callers failing to correctly answer. This was followed by an extremely profane rant on the FU line directed at various Hollywood celebrities and the Academy Awards.  A "fake O" contest followed, where two female callers attempted to simulate orgasm sounds, with the hosts and producer Rick offering feedback.  Rich Voss then arrived in studio.  The ensuing conversation with Voss was filled with vulgar jokes, arguments, and accounts of Voss's personal life, featuring insults and crude humor. The hosts also discussed their upcoming appearance on Bill O’Reilly’s show and previewed potentially embarrassing moments from the filming.

A caller recounted a graphically detailed failed hotel rendezvous, prompting various unrelated tangents. This was followed by a listener contest to guess how Voss “made history,” revealing his *Def Comedy Jam* appearance as the first white comedian to perform in blackface, a clip of which was played, containing numerous racial slurs and offensive jokes.  The ensuing discussion involved vulgar and offensive commentary on Voss's act and personal life.  Jim Norton expressed frustration with Verizon's service.  The Iron Sheik then appeared in-studio, promoting a comic book convention appearance. The conversation included discussions of his wrestling career, experiences in Iran, and airport security encounters, all laced with offensive language.

The show continued with the Iron Sheik in-studio, the hosts taking photos with him.  The "What Do We Learn Next" segment followed, featuring humorous and vulgar anecdotes from callers and staff, including jokes about Star Jones' appearance, Jim Norton's performance, Verizon's service, and the Iron Sheik's English.  Recurring characters "Awesome Garrett" and "Boss" also contributed.  The show concluded with more off-color jokes and banter, including further comments about "Boss's" act and the Iron Sheik, and a mention of Jim Norton's upcoming TLA show in Philadelphia, with tickets offered to listeners.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Welcome to the O&A show. A couple phone numbers in the New York area. 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including...  Oh, oh, oh. Come on, we know where.  Cleveland.  Cleveland.  Goddamn you guys in Cleveland.  We're going to Cleveland soon. Real soon.  I think we're going to be joining Jim Noren up there in Cleveland.  I'm hearing things about Cleveland.  We're hearing things about things in Cleveland.  A little bit. A little bit. A little bit. A little bit. A little bit, maybe. 
[00:00:30]  I don't know how we get all this information, considering that we don't subscribe to the ratings anymore.  No, our company, for some reason, doesn't subscribe.  Yet, well, it's like a trickle-down thing.  It trickles down, and we get some limited information from some unnamed sources.  So it looks like we're doing a little more good in Cleveland than last month.  Right, and we were doing pretty more good-er last month.  We were doing pretty good-er.  Right, and now we're a little more good-er than the pretty good-er. 
[00:01:00]  A little more good-er.  That was previous stated last month.  Right.  So if you're in Cleveland or anywhere else outside of New York, this is the number for you, 866-277-4WOW.  That's 866-277-4WOW.  Right.  Officially, it is Whip-Em-Out Wednesday, Anthony.  Yes, it is.  Might not be the weather for it, you know, optimum weather in this city, and maybe not 
[00:01:30]  where you're listening, but it is Wednesday.  Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  We're getting close, though.  We're getting close.  First real warm day on a Wednesday here in New York City.  Wow comes back in full force, but it's always happening, right?  Of course.  Want to explain to the new cities real fast?  Oh, you drive around, you're driving home from work, you're going to the store.  Anytime you're in your vehicle, you put a WOW somewhere on your vehicle, whether it's one  of our sanctioned bumper stickers.  A lot of the stations have the WOW stickers on. 
[00:02:00]  Or it doesn't matter.  You can write it on the dirt in the back of your truck.  You send us a self-addressed stamped envelope, we'll send you some WOW stickers from New York.  Yeah.  Or just write it on a piece of goddamn paper.  We don't care.  In your window.  It doesn't matter.  Homemade WOW signs, very good.  And then you just drive.  Right.  You just drive around.  You'd pay no attention to it.  Maybe you'll forget about it.  And then one day you'll be sitting in traffic, you're listening to this show, you're pissed  off that you're not going to get home in time.  You look out your window and go, why is this chick showing me her cans? 
[00:02:30]  And then they can hit you like, oh, that's right.  I put a WOW on my car.  And I'm being flashed.  That's right.  That's what it's all about.  Two things we ask, you don't harass the ladies, you don't follow the ladies.  No.  There are ladies out there that'll do this.  You put it on your car and then forget about it.  And just kind of wait and see what happens.  But it will happen to most of you out there.  Oh, yeah.  It's the best radio contest in America.  Because everyone can be involved.  Because we get lots of winners.  Also, the WOW thing shows support for the show.  Right.  Like these guys are doing today on the bridge. 
[00:03:00]  Danny, New York City Trooper, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  How the hell are you?  All right, bro.  Hey, got a nice WOW sign for you.  It's a patriotic WOW sign.  It's on a military Humvee at the George Washington Bridge headed from Jersey into New York.  There you go.  Big WOW on that?  The lower level, huge WOW sign on the side, and we got two more WOW signs.  You can give it out a little patriotic WOW for the guys out here.  You know, I'm all for the patriotic WOW thing. 
[00:03:30]  Of course.  I know why you're calling, sir.  Why is that?  You want to see something today.  I want to see some cans.  I see right through your lies.  Not me.  Not me.  You know, we just want to give a little shout out for the show also, you know.  Where's your location, sir?  We're on the GWB.  Okay.  Lower level.  All right.  And we're stopping the trucks from coming down at the bottom.  All right.  But the National Guard's here with a huge WOW sign.  Oh, so are you sitting there or you're not moving, right?  No, we're all stationary.  All stationary.  So, ladies, help the guys out over there. 
[00:04:00]  Hey, we really appreciate it, guys.  All right, Danny.  All right, be careful, guys.  Take care.  All right, peace.  Bye-bye.  There you go.  They just want to see some cans.  What's up, Jim Norton?  Hi, how are you?  Norton.  All right.  Doing good.  Yeah, we're getting some sad news.  Is it sad news?  I think it's pretty sad.  Yes.  Because the last few years of his life was...  Pretty sad.  Pretty sad.  Oh, see, there's the music.  Christopher Cross, right?  No, unfortunately, it wasn't. 
[00:04:30]  No, not Christopher Cross.  Unfortunately, it wasn't Christopher Cross.  I forgot.  You don't watch the news.  You don't read the news.  John Gielgud's been dead for a while.  That's right.  A couple of years.  I think it was 2000.  John Gielgud died.  Yeah.  Arthur has died.  Arthur's dead.  Dudley Moore has passed.  I heard it was a brain tumor, a grape-sized tumor behind his ear.  No.  No?  Oh, that's someone else. 
[00:05:00]  He had some kind of wacky disease that I never heard of.  They say it was similar to Parkinson's.  Right.  But it was like ate away at his brain and stuff.  Yeah, they did something special on him on ABC or something.  Yeah.  They showed him playing piano at the old folks' home.  Yeah.  And he kind of fell over and stuff.  Yeah, it was really.  It was really, really sad.  What do you say?  This is a goner. 
[00:05:30]  This is a goner.  This is a goner.  I think you guys are missing the big picture that there is not going to be a sequel to Holy  Moses.  Oh, what a shame.  I was looking forward to Arthur 3 because 2 was just so funny.  Yeah.  He was living in Jersey.  His disease, funnier than Arthur 2.  Oh, come on.  Arthur 1 was very funny, the first one.  Arthur 2 is like, you know, he was fun-spirited in Arthur 1. 
[00:06:00]  It was like he was the lovable drunk.  And Arthur 2 is like, oh my God, they are right.  Arthur, get some help.  It's like just sad.  But wasn't the plot of Arthur 2 where he was straightening his act up?  Yeah, he was trying.  And he wasn't drinking as much and he was sober through most of the thing?  That's not fun.  They became poor.  It was like they lost the money and had to get...  It was almost like Rocky with a club foot.  Lost the money with a club foot.  Oh, club foot Dudley.  We're poor.  Oh, I think now I should be going to the hospital. 
[00:06:30]  Eh, too late.  As we can all see, it's a lovely day, which would seem to indicate that the night is over.  I look forward to your next syllable with great ego.  This is a garner.  Yes.  Dudley Moore.  Oh, I'm dead.  Dead.  Don't you love being dead, Bitterman? 
[00:07:00]  Isn't death the best thing to be?  Don't you hate being dead?  He's taking the knife out of the cheese.  You think he's going to kill me?  Dudley Moore.  I don't even remember him from the original Bedazzled.  Very funny.  The movie Ten. 
[00:07:30]  Ten.  A classic.  Ten.  Now he's dead.  The age of 67.  He's taking the scalpel out of the tray.  You think they're doing an autopsy?  There you go.  Dead.  It's 66 years old.  Ben, move up the screen there. 
[00:08:00]  After a long battle against a rare brain disorder.  Doesn't it suck?  Like, 66 isn't like, you know, it used to be.  It's not ridiculously old or anything.  And, like, he had had this disease for, like, ten years.  So by the time he's in his 50s, his life pretty much blows.  And then he has to wait years before he drops dead.  That was awful. 
[00:08:30]  What did he do in a previous life to deserve that?  All right.  Mike, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up?  I'm very sad to report for Mr. Norton there that Ozzy Osbourne, the drummer, Mr. Randy Castillo, passed away yesterday.  Oh, man, what happened?  He had cancer.  He had gotten a little bit better.  The big casino, Tony.  And then he got the big C.  Oh, wow.  Dr. Kennedy couldn't take care of him.  Why didn't they just go to Dr. Kennedy?  Oh, dude, I didn't know that.  Are you BSing us?  No, I'm serious.  It was announced on a couple of websites today that it had been known that he was sick. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, yeah, those are really accurate.  You can read about deaths on the website.  Dude, he couldn't be lying.  No one would yank Randy Castillo out of thin air.  There you go.  I mean, you know, what am I going to do?  Pull that name out of my ass?  Come on.  His real name wasn't Mike Source, was it?  Actually, I got it from Junior Drudge.  Junior Drudge.  How old was he, man?  He was a really good drummer.  I don't know.  He was in his 30s, I think.  But, you know, he was, it's a shame.  He was really good.  He wasn't playing for Ozzy now.  Mike Borden, I think, is playing for Ozzy now.  Yeah, he had his own project with Mike Inez from, you know, 
[00:09:30]  a bunch of other washed-up dudes.  Look at you, two Ozzy fans talking.  So, yeah.  Tug, you know, a little tug on each other.  That's right.  We're going to go for a rubbing tug and then watch bootlegs together.  Hey, did you know that Diary of Mad Men and Blizzard of Oz were recorded together?  Just making the up-and-down motion with the hands.  A little spit and a tug in the palm of your hand.  Sure.  Two men sharing.  Yeah.  Maybe we can put on my Garrett as an awesome Garrett and laugh each other to sleep.  Then we can wash each other and lather each other up in the shower.  Yeah, two men just cleaning up, laughing about it later. 
[00:10:00]  Then we'll share a beer when we wash each other's back.  Norton, you've got to record my Garrett's an awesome Garrett.  Dude, I really...  My Garrett is an awesome Garrett.  And he has little hair on his abs.  I've been thinking about that song all day.  It's been in my head.  All right, Mike.  Thanks for the info.  Thanks, Mike.  Take care, fellas.  All right.  Oh, God.  That last picture of Dudley Moore.  It doesn't even look like him.  Let me see.  Turn it around.  Look.  I hate seeing...  Oh, my God.  Oh, he's in a wheelchair.  He's got, like, the top hat on, like, oh, shit. 
[00:10:30]  It looks like Winston Churchill.  Yeah.  After he died.  Hey, Steve, you're next.  What's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  How you doing?  All right.  You guys are missing the funniest line, the actual only funny line from Arthur 2,  On the Rocks, is when he's on the boat skeet shooting, and he's trying to figure  out what the hell he's doing, and he pulls the trigger on the gun, and then he yells,  pull, and he starts yelling at the skeet, hit the bullet, hit the bullet, in a drunken 
[00:11:00]  stupor.  The only good line from that whole movie.  Hello?  This is a gomma.  He punched out, man.  Pull the handle and punch out.  Your plane is in flames.  I think we made our point about Arthur 2 right there, huh?  Wow.  That was the funniest part.  Wow.  All right.  Kate and her friends checking in.  Kate, what's going on? 
[00:11:30]  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Pretty good.  I just want to let you know that me and my friend Lauren think it's a beautiful day.  We're out on 22 in New Jersey, and we're just waiting for those wow signs, but nobody  seems to be looking.  So, basically, if you see someone with a wow, drive by you guys.  You're going to flash.  Nice.  Tell them.  We're right here, and we have big boobies.  All right.  It's Route 22.  In New Jersey.  Well, there's a lot of Route 22 in New Jersey.  Around the Bridgewater area.  You want to give us an exit? 
[00:12:00]  I'm right by the Bridgewater Commons Mall.  And how about a make of a car there?  We got, we're driving a red blazer.  All right.  There you go.  Two hot girls willing to wow if they see the wow signs, right?  What?  All right.  Kate, if it happens, call us back, all right?  All right.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  The Hamburger Pimp has some Dudley Moore movies that were set to be released, but Arthur  3, Death on the Rocks, Weekend at Dudley's, Mickey and Dead, and Like Father, Like Dead. 
[00:12:30]  And the junk says, too bad we can't see Dudley's next movie, Ten Feet Under.  Guys, it just happened.  It just happened.  Not enough time went by.  We're not following the rule.  Come on.  You've got to wait at least a week.  You didn't get ready to meet Moses. 
[00:13:00]  That's horrible, man.  That really is.  The guy gave a lot of people a lot of joy throughout the years.  Yeah, he was a real hero.  He did a bunch of B-films.  Yeah, God bless him.  Old pudding-headed, club-footed zilch.  Oh, my God.  Jesus, Jim.  Kelly, what's going on?  Hi.  How are you guys doing?  Pretty good.  That phone sucks.  I'm calling, because I am all set to wow.  I've got, you know, I'm ready to go.  Not a wow sticker to be seen.  Yeah.  Nothing.  See, you guys are crazy if you just don't put wow in your car and see what happens. 
[00:13:30]  These girls are out there, and they're willing to do this.  Yes, go ahead, Kelly.  I'm on the Bruckner, and I don't want anyone to think, you know, I'm on the Bruckner, so  maybe people don't listen, you know, I hear from the Bronx, but if you guys listen in  the Bronx, put wow stickers on your car.  All right.  I want a wow.  All right.  Thank you, Kelly.  All right.  Bye, guys.  You know, it's been a long winter, Anthony.  Yeah.  A pretty easy winter, but we've kind of, you know, put wow to the side, but I think  it's time to bring it back full force.  Mm-hmm.  You guys, if you don't have a wow sticker, oh, it's everyone that calls in on that line 
[00:14:00]  is going to suck today?  It's fine.  If you don't have a wow sticker, send a self-addressed stamped envelope to us here  in New York.  Right.  The address is on opieandanthony.com, and we'll send them out to you, okay?  But the stations we broadcast on all over the country, a lot of those stations have wow  stickers.  If you can't get a wow sticker, make a homemade one.  Simple as that.  Right.  Because these girls are ready and willing to go, so.  Oh, another Dudley Moore movie.  Six weeks to live.  Oh.  Oh. 
[00:14:30]  Hey, Rob, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  Say what you want about Dudley Moore, he banged the crap out of Susan Anton.  When she was hot, too.  Yeah, when she was hot.  When she was hot.  Nice.  And she was what, like six foot tall, he was 5'2", maybe?  Yeah, Dudley Moore said he's the only person, he went up on Susan Anton.  He went up on her.  Anyway, I live in Central Jersey, and there's a Charlie Browns, and Dudley Moore in his wheelchair  used to be in there like three times a week. 
[00:15:00]  Right, I remember hearing that.  Yeah, he was dead like five years ago, man.  He looked like he had a stroke.  Wow.  But he was still pounding Scotch down like a champ.  Well, wouldn't you, if you had that rare disease?  Oh, hell yeah.  Where in Jersey did he live, sir?  Do you know?  Yeah, he lived in Scotch Plains.  Oh, that's sad, man.  So, I want to let you tools know that.  You guys suck.  All right, thank you.  Thank you, my friend.  What is this about?  Uh, Nick, what's going on?  Yo.  Hey. 
[00:15:30]  Can I, uh, get one of those t-shirts, Tommy Messed Up?  From New Orleans?  Yeah.  Well, I guess they, uh, printed up a bunch of wow t-shirts for the station in New Orleans,  and, uh, they screwed it all up, didn't they?  Yeah.  Again?  Do we have those shirts?  Ben's giggling.  I don't know.  All right.  Thank you, Nick.  Hold on.  Huh?  Hold on a line.  If we have one, we'll send it out to you, okay?  All right.  Yeah.  I don't even know if we have one around here.  The cult classic Drop Dead Dudley. 
[00:16:00]  Oh.  You're enjoying this today.  And there's that thing with, I think, Daryl Hannes in it.  It was called Dead People.  Nice.  Wow.  That was a good one.  All right, we're just catching up with our listeners here.  We've got a very busy show, by the way.  And they're writing an ad called Coffins.  They're nice but boxy.  Matt, what's going on?  I can't believe I'm dead.  Hey, Matt. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  Yo, I was at the WWF Smackdown taping in Philly last night.  Yeah.  And we were sitting down ringside, and all of a sudden there's this big commotion behind  us, and all the security guys come down.  They confiscate these two signs, and I saw them as they were going by.  One was a wow sign.  The other one said, Norton likes mules.  Oh, why did they take that?  I don't know.  Seriously, I think they trained the first union center guys to spot ONA signs in the crowd.  And they take them now.  I thought I was at WWF, but apparently I wandered into Nazi Germany. 
[00:17:00]  Well, you know what?  WWF is very cool with the ONA signs, so that might be a little local thing they're doing.  Wow.  Yeah, but what's wrong with Norton likes mules?  I think that's hilarious.  And what's wrong with liking them?  Elbow, elbow.  Blah, blah, blah.  Boy, that's a spongy pink one.  High five me.  All right, well, thanks for that, bro.  All right, later.  All right.  Okay.  I don't know why they do that.  Oh, look at this.  How great is that?  There's a Norton is God sign.  That really makes me happy.  Hey, there you go. 
[00:17:30]  Was that at the SmackDown tape?  Yeah.  Oh, cool.  We'll see a lot of...  Could you email me a copy of that?  Yeah.  We'll see a lot of ONA signs.  SmackDown was filmed in Philly.  Yes.  Tomorrow night.  We should take a break, okay?  Goddamn.  Some of these people are just sick.  I'm going to tape my CD in Philly this week.  Huh?  I'm looking forward to taping my CD in Philly.  Oh.  I have to do that, yes.  Really?  Yeah, man.  We're going to be recording this.  Yeah, what better place, man?  Philly's got to do it in Philly.  Wow, look at that.  There's some new news.  Voss' comedy CD is going to have some competition out there. 
[00:18:00]  Well, he actually taped his CD in Philly when there were only 13 stars on the flag.  Speaking of Voss...  Oh, my God.  He's coming in at 5 today, and he doesn't know why.  Yeah, we won't tell him.  We have a little surprise for Rich Voss today.  I don't know what you're talking about, either.  No, I don't think you know, either.  Also, we're going to play another version of the Oz game today.  Yes, we've got some new Oz clips.  Star Jones ran out of food.  We've got to get to that story, finally.  Lady suing over slavery. 
[00:18:30]  A little reparations, I think, right?  And when we get back, I think we've got to talk about the Osbournes real fast.  Very, very funny.  The show is hysterical, and last night's episode...  Dude, you're such an Aussie freak, and you don't watch the show.  I need to tape it.  I'm doing sets every night.  I've got to get TiVo.  I don't have a TV in my apartment.  I moved into New York.  I have no TV, no computer.  I can't tape it.  How do you have no TV?  I've got to buy one.  I've got one thing at a time.  Jim, how long is it going to take you to get a copy of it?  You guys see my check every week.  I've got to be careful. 
[00:19:00]  Why didn't you come down to the office for some of the showings?  I saw it last night.  I didn't realize you were having showings.  No one told me that.  I saw it last night at home, and we've seen it at least three times in the office.  I've seen the first one.  Because you pick up on something different every time you watch it.  Dude, it depresses me to watch it, because I'm not a member of his life.  Oh, is that it?  You want to be in the house and go, hey, Oz.  Hey, Jim.  Sit down on the couch with Ozzy.  Yeah.  Pet his dogs.  Yeah, while it's in his lap, maybe miss a little. 
[00:19:30]  All right.  You'll judge him on you.  We'll tell you all about the Osbournes, okay?  And I think Ozzy's calling in today.  Ah, great.  Yeah, he is.  And I think he's going to call in next.  Хорошо.  У них есть эти большие детские.  Whip, whip, whip, whip.  Детские.  Whip, whip, whip, whip.  Детские.  Wedding day.  It's off the hook, yo.  O.P. and A.P.  Yeah, the latest from Godsmack.  I stand alone.  Yeah.  That rocks, huh, Jim?  Yeah, that's really good.  I love that stuff. 
[00:20:00]  We're back with the O&A Show.  On this fine whip-em-out Wednesday, Paul, what's going on?  Hey, nothing much, fellas.  What's going on?  Hey, you tell us.  Look, man, I got a comment to make about the WOW stickers here in Louisiana.  Yeah.  The fact of the matter is, I had to get a friend of mine from up there in New York to mail me one.  Real.  Is there any way you guys could stick one in everybody's mailbox around here?  Well, is Tom making WOW stickers down there, Ben?  I think he messed up something. 
[00:20:30]  Hey, I told him.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  He's a cool, cool guy.  Hold on, Paul.  Hold on.  What?  He just told me that there was a problem with him.  I didn't even...  I just...  There's nothing...  There was a problem with the stickers.  He put the adhesive on the wrong side, that southern retard.  Hey, check this out, man.  Yeah.  If I ever get to see you out here with a WOW sticker, Norton, you know what I would do?  I hope it's not showing me your mule.  I would do something special just for you.  Check this out.  He hung up on me.  Of course.  I knew that was coming. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  Although I was hoping it was something else.  Yeah.  The new cities, they've got to give us time with this WOW thing.  It takes a little time.  We haven't even really started to promote it.  I made them upside down.  They're MOM stickers.  MOM.  I don't know what happened.  There was a problem at the printer.  He really is an S.  He is so incompetent.  What a big southern buffoon.  God, he is the stereotypical big southern buffoon. 
[00:21:30]  You people in the south down there, you got to realize the reason some people have this stereotype about you,  no matter how educated you are, what a good person and how quick-witted and sharp you are,  it is all negated when you have a oaf, a doofus, black Tom.  They can't figure out how to print up WOW stickers.  There was a problem with the adhesive.  My bad. 
[00:22:00]  It was on the wrong side.  But Mama's going to help me, and that's all I have to say about that.  Hey, Guy Bannister, fix the stickers.  You know, he's going to call now.  What's up?  No, there was a problem, but it wasn't my fault.  Concrete Walker.  He's calling us Concrete Walkers, Anthony.  Goddamn city folk.  Play it, Bertram.  I don't know what happened.  It seems a mass of the stickers fell into some jambalaya. 
[00:22:30]  He's radio gold for this show, though, I'll tell you.  Guy is an oaf.  If you're down there, you might want to just print up your own WOW stuff.  Just print them off, because you're not going to get them.  Just give up at this point and print up your own.  I've got to put the station logo on it, but I forgot what that was.  Well, that's what he did with the T-shirts.  Yeah, with the T-shirts.  See, Tom, it's good if you promote your station, not the station we're on in New York.  Yeah.  What's that?  W-N-A-W. 
[00:23:00]  That's what happened to all the T-shirts down there.  Yeah, he made up the T-shirts.  The station we're on in Louisiana, Extreme Radio, he decided to put the big W-N-A-W logo from the station we're on here in New York.  Why is the Stonehenge Monument eight inches high?  I wanted it eight feet high.  I know where you're going.  You idiot.  Boob.  He is a boob.  Heather, what's going on?  Not much.  We're just driving around Cleveland with two wow stickers on what we call the Shag and Wagon, and nobody wants to wow us. 
[00:23:30]  There's two girls and two guys in the car.  Shag and Wagon, huh?  You girls are wowing other guys when you see their stickers?  Well, yeah, we see stickers, but it seems like the only time we see them is during the week.  Right.  We see them every day but Wednesday, so we changed it from Whip It Out Wednesday to Whip It Out Whenever.  Well, we've been doing the Whip It Out Whenever.  Yeah, we drive around town.  We hang out at the bar, and I'm always wowing everybody.  They pretty much...  See, there you go, Cleveland. 
[00:24:00]  There you go.  A couple girls that are wowing right now.  Willing to do it.  Willing to do it.  Get your wow on your ride.  All right, Heather, thank you.  Uh-huh.  Thank you.  And thanks for the good news today in Cleveland.  Hey, you all.  Yes.  Looks like we're doing okay up there.  When are you guys coming to Cleveland?  When Jim's in town.  When Jim's in town, good, because if you guys come out here, we'll let you guys know where  we're at, and you guys will wow you guys.  All right, cool.  Thank you, Heather.  All right.  Later.  Bye.  Mm-hmm.  All right, one more, and then we've got to talk about the Osbournes.  Andrew, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  How come that Southern accent sounds so hot on a girl, but so stupid on a guy? 
[00:24:30]  That's why it sounds hot on a girl, because it makes her sound stupid and vulnerable.  Hey, Jim.  I'll take care of the stickers.  Oh, God, he totally nailed it.  I really didn't think he was going to do that, because he was in mid-sets.  Really, really nailed him.  I don't like it.  I'm sorry.  I got window clings.  Now, let me take this satellite system out of the station.  That's a callback from about four years.  There's one for New York. 
[00:25:00]  Too long to explain.  See, New York, we do stuff for you.  Terrence, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I accidentally put NOW, National Organization of Women, on the bumper stickers.  Means something completely different, darn it.  All right, hold on.  Now we have to go back to Jason here.  Jason, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  It was your sign that was confiscated at SmackDown last night?  Yes, it was.  We had a couple of them.  We had Buddy Says, Whoa, Doggy.  Right.  And we had Norton is God, and we had a huge wow, like fluorescent yellow and black. 
[00:25:30]  It was just eye-popping.  It was just so distracting.  They had to pull it.  We were in the third row behind.  It was great.  Did you get it on at all?  Hopefully, we got it on the beginning of heat, because as soon as they saw it, they took it  like 10 minutes in.  Damn it.  Did they say anything to you guys?  They just said that they were offensive, and they pulled him.  Offensive?  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Oh, boy.  They said it was offensive, and my brother started getting in the face with this guy,  and he got thrown out.  Offensive?  Oh, boy. 
[00:26:00]  Was it WWF people, or?  Yes.  It was?  Yeah, because we're like, where are our signs?  Because we want them back.  They were perfectly, they were professionally made for us.  Yeah, but was it the WWF security or the venue security?  It was, I want to say it was the venue, but we asked for them back, and they said the  WWF took care of them already.  Took care of them.  That means ripped them up.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  All right, Jason.  Well, thanks for trying to help us out.  You want a prize?  Yeah, give them something.  Hold on, Jay, all right?  Sure, thanks.  All right.  It's funny, it's not offensive when you're giving plugs to all these gigs and events. 
[00:26:30]  Right.  Not a very offensive show then.  You know, putting a few of the asses in the seats, as they say, and then they, how  is wow offensive?  Like, just wow.  I mean, I've seen stuff where, you know, hey, the show us your puppies thing is a little  more blatant.  Yeah, how is wow offensive?  It couldn't be wrestling, unless it's taking away attention from that.  Yeah, I don't know.  I'd be real surprised if you did WWF.  I would, too.  It's probably just some venue people with a friggin' attitude.  Oh, well.  All right. 
[00:27:00]  Terrence, what's going on?  Hey, not much, guys.  I'm surprised that trash and WWF shows won't wow anyway.  Anyway, listen.  Whoa.  I just wanted to comment on how hysterical Ozzy Osbourne's wife was last night, dancing  to that thrash metal from Denmark.  Did you hear that kid when he put him on?  Yeah, Denmark death metal to get back at the neighbors.  Denmark death metal.  That was excellent.  And then she starts moshing like there's people around her and everything.  Well, she's insane.  Yeah.  Out of her mind, man. 
[00:27:30]  Out of her mind.  And can I tell you something about Sharon?  I've met her once.  She is sexy in person.  Oh, really?  I'm not kidding.  Yeah.  They're really sexy.  Yeah?  Yeah.  In what way?  Dude, her personality.  There's something really...  When did you meet her?  Backstage at the Ozzy zombie show.  You couldn't get near Ozzy, man.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he had security.  So you had to get close enough to her that was kind of close to Ozzy.  You can't be serious.  Did you get a picture with Sharon?  No, that she's sexy.  Dude, I hugged her in a picture. 
[00:28:00]  I got a photo.  She is...  I'm telling you.  What's sexy about her?  It was a vibe she gave off.  Wait, Ben is saying it, too?  Yeah.  She's something...  Look, she landed one of the biggest rock stars ever.  Oh, I'm still not sure he knows where he is in his marriage.  No, no.  There's something really...  And I'm not saying that you think you have a shot with her.  There was just something sexy about her.  Sexy?  Yeah, I'm not kidding.  And I was surprised, too.  Ben, get on the mic.  She's a good-looking older woman.  When you look at some of those...  Not in all the shots on the show, but she's a good-looking older woman. 
[00:28:30]  Really?  Yeah, I'm telling you, because she's staying there and she was so nice.  Actually, that's a good point.  What?  Dan's mom is hot.  Sharon Osbourne is not hot.  I agree with Norton on that.  I think she's a good-looking older woman.  All right.  Good for Oz.  Well, they're certainly not showing her hotness during the Osbournes.  Dan from Hoboken saying Sharon was dead sexy when she rubbed her son's teddy bear on her taint.  You can see the outline of Ozzy's wife's taint last night on the Osbournes.  For some reason, at one point in the show, she's laying on her back.  She lifts her feet up like some sort of monkey and puts them near her face. 
[00:29:00]  So her ass is just showing completely.  And the type of pants she was wearing were very hugging to every little nook and cranny and contour.  And you can see not just camel toe.  You saw where taint and, you know, what taint is between.  You saw both of those areas.  So you're talking midgets, catcher's mitt.  Right.  Midget, catcher's mitt, balloon knot, taint, everything.  The whole knuckle.  It looked like she was getting ready to do the six o'clock queef. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  Yes.  And then she rubs her son's teddy bear on there and her son grabs the teddy bear and hugs it.  I think she farted, though, too.  I don't know what she did.  She farted on the bear.  Huh?  How old abroad is she?  I'd guess late 40s, early 50s.  That'd be my guess because I think Ozzy's in his mid-earth.  I didn't get a gray look, but I would say, um, what?  I'm sorry.  I didn't realize you asked him that.  No, but, all right, whatever.  Late 40s, yeah.  Jag off I am just totally ruining a moment for you guys.  Sorry.  Sounds like I have a main moment.  Answering it seriously. 
[00:30:00]  You guys are doing something funny.  Like, oh, technically speaking, shut up, chitlins.  That could have been a big part of today's show.  Thanks, Jim.  Sorry.  Aaron, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  One of the best parts of last night's show was when he was trying to throw something out  and every garbage pile he went to had no bag in it.  Yeah.  I wish I could hear that music they were playing.  Poor frigging Ozzy, man, because he's walking around just stumbling.  The guy can barely walk, it looks like. 
[00:30:30]  He shuffles, he doesn't lift his feet.  He's got this dead look in his eyes and his hands are kind of out like he's sleepwalking.  And he's holding this paper and he's walking around all confused like he doesn't know where  to put it.  His eyes are all wide open with just no spark left in him at all.  And he's walking around with paper in his hand looking where he can throw it away.  All confused.  Wait until next week when he starts working out.  Oh, how funny was that at the end of the episode?  Oh, God.  They show him he's got a trainer and he's trying to work out. 
[00:31:00]  Are you looking good, Ozzy?  He's got a let's get physical headband on.  Let's get physical, physical.  I want to get physical.  Let's get physical.  Let me hear your body's whole.  He's just gone.  It's great.  All right, man.  Stay easy, guys.  Bye.  Hey, classic.  Yeah, and this was the other highlight from last night.  Chris, what's going on? 
[00:31:30]  Hey, how much, guys?  What a great show.  I kept waiting for Nurse Ratched to come out and hand out meds every two minutes last night.  And didn't Ozzy look like Tim Conway?  Remember that old shuffle walk?  He did not look like Mr. Tudball.  Oh, man.  Mr. Tudball.  You guys rock.  Have a good day.  That's classic for the Carol Burnett Show.  Very good.  Good reference.  Yeah.  All right.  Why are we off in Boston?  I keep saying, guys, they just cut you off in Boston in the middle of the Ozzy wife talk 
[00:32:00]  and went to commercials.  Satellite problems.  What's Tom running WBCN now?  People are saying, you just went off in Boston.  What's with all the effing radio silence and cut to commercial?  I could see a problem.  Dude, effing BCN just cut out.  What the eff happened.  You're off the air.  You went off the air in Philly.  Just lost a feed here in Cleveland.  Great.  Great.  So we're off the air on all the networks.  It happens all the time, too. 
[00:32:30]  How you doing, New York?  We still love you.  We just make believe we like everyone else.  I found it.  It's ridiculous.  Great.  It happens every once in a while, whatever.  But it happens all the time.  This is the second time this week alone.  Okay, now we can do all these bits.  Hey, I want you guys to appear in front of the world's biggest biscuit engraving.  We'll do old promotion people from N.E.W. bits. 
[00:33:00]  I want you to appear.  It's going to be next to the world's largest biscuit.  And then I'm going to steal satellite equipment.  And lithographs.  And some lithographs off the wall.  And then I'm opening up a book stall without books.  It's talking books.  It's a miracle of modern nature.  All right, well, we'll just move on with the show here. 
[00:33:30]  Goddamn.  Brad, what's going on?  Did you guys notice that when Ozzy was trying to, when they were throwing things into the neighbor's backyard,  Ozzy picked something up like he was going to throw it.  But she knew there was no chance in hell that that thing was even going to go ten inches with his arm.  Oh, yeah, I know.  Yeah.  Well, he looked like he was going to throw the log.  It was like a cut log from the fireplace or something.  And he's walking around.  And, yeah, looking at him, I know exactly what you mean.  I was looking going, there's no way he's going to throw that thing a foot.  It's going to land on his foot. 
[00:34:00]  I was waiting for him to throw it because I know it's going to land right where he threw it out of his hand.  Yeah, he's like, I can't picture Ozzy launching that thing any further than a foot.  I imagine Ozzy won't be taking his kid to baseball camp for pitching any time soon.  No, we got the clip from last night.  You want to check it out?  Oh, really?  Yeah, hold on a second, Brad.  Ozzy.  Ozzy.  Ozzy.  What?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Here's the truth.  Ozzy, not wood.  You could be done for man's daughter. 
[00:34:30]  He's going to the side of the house.  Ozzy.  See, he must have gone like right next to the house and then just pushed the log through the window.  And then you see the cop cars coming and that was the end of the episode, so I hope they continue with that.  Did you catch up the end, too, when they showed the clips for next week's show, the bubble machine?  I was telling Sharon how he was the prince of darkness and how bubbles were gay. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, my God.  We got that.  They didn't like the bubble.  For some reason, they had a big bubble machine behind him.  The prince of bloody darkness.  Yeah, behind the stage.  And I don't think Ozzy really likes the idea of bubbles, you know, considering his image.  So here's that clip.  He loves performing.  Bubbles.  That's what he lives for.  Oh, come on, Sharon.  I'm f***ing up Ozzy.  I'm the prince of f***ing darkness.  Evil, evil.  What's f***ing evil? 
[00:35:30]  I'm going to borrow the bubbles.  I'm Ozzy.  I'm the prince of darkness.  The guy's in hell.  The prince of darkness with a bubble machine on stage.  He was really the prince of darkness walking around with that paper trying to throw it away.  And trying to open up the garbage bag.  It's Ozzy Welk.  Oh, my God.  All right, guys.  Take it easy.  What happened to the neighbor?  This is my question.  What type of neighbor could do anything to offend the Osborne?  Well, they were playing lousy music. 
[00:36:00]  They were singing at 2.30 in the morning when the Osborne's had to sleep.  Kumbaya or something?  They were singing, oh, my girl.  My girl.  Oh, and then the Osborne's decided they were going to, especially Sharon, decided she was  going to throw bagels and a big hunk of ham at the house and various fruit.  And then they called the cops.  And the cops came and said, don't throw bagels.  Just call the cops next time you have a problem with the neighbors being too loud. 
[00:36:30]  So, uh, it didn't take long before they're outside with a huge basket of fruit and bread  throwing it at the house.  And that's when Ozzy picked up a fireplace log, walked out of the front gate, walked over  to the house, and threw the log through the window.  It is classic.  And then you saw the side of it.  Yeah.  Then the cops came.  So, I guess next week we get to see, uh, what happened.  Sharon.  You've got to hide me, Sharon. 
[00:37:00]  The police are coming.  Sharon, I'll hide under the kiddie pool until the police go away.  No, this is my house.  My house.  I've been tired to do it.  I won't get away.  You're not handcuffing Ozzy Osbourne.  I'm the...  You can't.  No, Sharon, it's going to take me away.  I'm the f***ing Prince of Darkness. 
[00:37:30]  You can't f***ing lock up Ozzy Osbourne.  Come on, man.  Bad boys, bad boys.  What you gonna do?  What you gonna do?  I swear I'm gonna slam your head against the window of the police.  Oh, you f***ing take me away.  Kenny, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, Owen?  Hey, man.  To me, I think MTV made a glass sound breaking because...  Yeah, I mean, that's... 
[00:38:00]  You know, how close is the house?  I said that to the guys in the back office.  It seemed like MTV did a little something with that sound effect.  Yeah, I don't think that was real.  I absolutely think he threw the log through the window.  I think maybe if they wanted to get the audio, they had to add the glass breaking sound.  But he walked out of his gate.  Those houses, the problem is, they're very close to each other.  That's why they have a problem with the neighbors playing music.  How funny is it going to be to watch him exercise?  Yeah, that just looked great. 
[00:38:30]  He looks like a 75-year-old man when he walks around.  When he is doing, like, that thing with his hands, like he piled his hands out flat and  started doing what looked like the hand jive.  I mean, I haven't even seen him.  How is he on stage?  Doing that crazy hand jive.  He's good on stage?  He's the greatest.  He still gets the job done.  He still moves around.  Hey, Norton, you've seen him, right?  I've seen him since 84.  I know he doesn't, but for those that do care, ever since the Bark at the Moon track, 
[00:39:00]  Motley Crue on tour.  No, he didn't.  You're 0 for 3 today, my friend.  No, because I knew he was going to hang out, but I have to explain this.  He doesn't care how many times you've seen him.  He does care.  Ladies and gentlemen, the Prince of Darkness himself.  Ozzy!  Jesus Christ, guys.  You got a picture where I'm going through here.  I'm sitting in my house.  I'm trying to work out.  No, I'm just verbally getting raped by you guys.  You know, but, you know, it's all in good fun, I guess. 
[00:39:30]  You're exercising, Ozzy?  Yeah, you know, I was working out my pectoral muscles.  Pectoral muscles.  You know, what's funny, you know, Anthony, you know, if anything gets boring in my bedroom,  you know, maybe we should bring you in.  Oh, shut up, Ozzy.  Even Ozzy knows about what happened to you over the weekend.  I can only imagine what's going on in your life.  No, you're my hero, man.  You know that.  Yeah, sure.  So, now, Ozzy, what seems to be the problem with the neighbors? 
[00:40:00]  No, like you say, you know, I was sleeping, you know, but...  Yeah, we saw.  Yeah, but what happened was, you know, the rest of the house, I guess, was being woken up  because they were playing, you know, some techno crap, you know, whatever, but, you know,  they went over and Jack put on some Meshuggah, you know, and...  Right.  You know, they were just keeping the rest of the house up, I guess.  You know, they were playing... 
[00:40:30]  Right, yeah, you were sleeping like a baby, though.  Yeah, you know, it doesn't bother me, you know.  And what about the gynecologist, Ozzy?  You were telling your daughter that you would love to go to the gynecologist.  Oh, you know, I felt a little, you know, embarrassed talking about my daughter's grass cut late on TV, you know,  but, you know, it's something I had to be, you know, you don't talk about, you know, I love my daughter, 
[00:41:00]  I want to make sure she's all right.  Right.  Right, so, you know, she's got to go to the gynecologist.  And, you know, if nothing else, you know, just for support, I'd go with her, you know.  That's a little sick, though.  She didn't look like she wanted Ozzy around.  You know, I can understand, you know, I wouldn't want my parents around either.  First of all, if I had a grass cut late, you know, I wouldn't want them to go with me.  But, you know, second of all, I think it would be nerve-wracking to have, you know, my parents in the gynecologist office, you know. 
[00:41:30]  So, hey, Ozzy, your daughter's developing quite nicely, too.  But she woke up in the middle of the night there and was running around.  Oh, came out with the T-shirt on and her pants were down really low.  And she has a little baby fat belly hanging out and two torpedoes there.  Two torpedoes.  She takes off to her mother, you know.  Right.  Right, right.  And you're the prince of darkness, Ozzy.  I am.  What's up with the bubble machine?  I have no freaking idea, you know. 
[00:42:00]  That's why I was yelling at Sharon, but I figured, you know, she'd know after all this time not to, you know, use, you know, freaking bubbles, you know.  So, you know, at the concert, we have the black, you know, confetti or whatever after, you know.  But that's followed by fire and stuff, you know.  Like the prince of darkness would use.  Sure, man.  You know, the bubbles, trust me, weren't my idea, you know.  It'll be fixed, you know. 
[00:42:30]  Right.  Yeah.  All right, Oz.  Well, thank you, Ozzy, for checking in.  We'll look forward to watching next week's episode.  Hopefully everything with the cops turns out okay.  All right, yeah.  Obviously, you know, I'm not talking to you from jail, you know.  Right.  Yeah.  Looks like you did all right with that.  Yeah.  Okay.  Thank you, Ozzy.  Sure, one more thing.  Hey, someone wants to tell you to have your daughter wear a bra.  Oh, go on. 
[00:43:00]  Do you have him on the phone right now?  Is he on?  Oh, you want to?  Yeah, all right.  Yeah, sure.  All right, here he is.  Adam.  Hey, Oz.  I'm a big fan.  How are you?  I'm a big fan, but listen, you got to have your daughter wear a bra.  Yeah.  I'm embarrassed for you, pal.  Yeah, sometimes I don't even know what's going on in the house, you know.  Obviously.  I'll keep that in mind.  Yeah, you got cameras in there now.  Yeah, thank you, Adam.  Thanks.  All right.  There goes that. 
[00:43:30]  Wear a bra.  I don't know.  I think it's kind of hot when she comes out all chubby and she's got her huge cans hanging  down like that.  There's something about it.  It's talking about your daughter there, Ozzy.  Yeah, it's okay.  You know, what am I going to do?  I couldn't come down to the studio and kick ass all over the place.  Now that he's working out.  Well, I like you guys, so, you know, it's all in good fun, I guess.  All right.  Well, thank you, Ozzy. 
[00:44:00]  No problem.  Anthony, before I go, I wanted to tell you something.  Yes?  Yes.  All right.  Even Ozzy's in.  I got nailed.  Right on, man.  All right.  Are we ready to play the Oz game?  We could go from talking about Ozzy to playing the Oz game?  Ozzy to Oz game.  Yes.  I love the Oz game.  Also, Rich Voss coming in around 5 o'clock and he doesn't know why. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  We got a little surprise for him.  We found a little something.  We just want to talk to him about it.  Yeah, a little surprise for Rich Voss today.  That's all.  Rip him out Wednesday.  Oh, man.  One day to go.  Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I love that.  Yeah, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  Whoa, Jimmy Norton in the studio today. 
[00:45:00]  Voss coming in at 5.  We forgot to ask Ozzy about this Russell Yates thing, huh?  Yeah, it seems Ozzy had a problem, has a problem with Russell Yates,  Andrew Yates' husband.  I guess Ozzy was going to do a Today Show taping,  and Russell Yates, the husband there, was going to be on the Today Show. 
[00:45:30]  And he said he was a big Ozzy Osbourne fan and wanted to get a picture with Ozzy.  And Ozzy, very pissed off at this, said no way he's going to take a photo with him.  Ozzy said, I'll burn his eyes out with a hot poker.  He's profiting directly from the demise of his own children.  And that, to me, is wrong.  After being warned that Yates was waiting for him in the green room,  the Osbournes ducked out the door. 
[00:46:00]  So Ozzy, not a big fan of this guy Russell Yates,  who is just a scum.  Yeah, he's a scum.  He's got a website and everything.  Yeah, this guy was defending his wife.  He was there for her.  Whatever you want to do.  I don't care.  You know what?  Who cares?  But, you know, it's over.  She's convicted.  That's it.  What's he?  He's going to the Today Show.  It's like he thinks he's a celebrity now.  He's got a website.  He's a celebrity because his kids are dead, 
[00:46:30]  because his lunatic wife.  Boy, that's being perceptive, dude.  How about looking at your chick  and realizing that any minute she's just going to snap  and kill your kids?  There may be a problem.  Yeah.  Does anybody not see the disgrace in this?  That this guy's wife drowns her kids  and he gets to do the Today Show with Ozzy Osbourne.  I'm doing comedy 12 years.  All right, Jim.  I can't hang with him.  Enough.  I'm ready to get married and pump out five kids quickly.  If that's what it takes to do the Today Show with Ozzy, 
[00:47:00]  that's what I'll do.  God, there is no justice in this world.  It sucks.  No, there isn't.  You're obsessive, man.  I'm nuts.  Almost 13 years I'm doing comedy.  You're a stalker.  I don't get...  No, I'm not.  You're an Ozzy stalker.  I'm not.  I've only...  I've met him twice and I was...  That's why you're doing the show with us.  Just to meet Ozzy.  Because you know eventually we're going to run into Ozzy again.  I was very normal when I met him.  I chatted with him and I was very...  I'm non-stalkerish, actually.  I give celebrities their room.  I just love Ozzy.  All right.  And would love videotape of me and him talking and laughing together. 
[00:47:30]  Oh!  Oh, sure.  We've got to interrupt you, Jim, because it's time to play the Oz game.  Wow.  We've got DVD copies of Oz, the complete first season, courtesy of HBO Home Video.  Oz, the complete first season is now available on VHS or DVD at all video stores.  This was kind of successful yesterday and we've got these DVDs to give away, so we'll  do it again today.  Right, Ant?  Yes.  Want to explain the Oz game?  Well, what a fun show this is.  There's so many fun, memorable lines from the show Oz. 
[00:48:00]  So, we're going to take some callers and we're going to play a line from Oz and then we're  going to stop it mid-stream and we'll give you multiple choice of the next part of that  line.  You'll have to guess which one is indeed the rest of the line.  It's easy.  All right?  We'll catch on when we start playing.  So, why don't we go right to the phones.  Our first contestant is Allison from Queens. 
[00:48:30]  What's up, Allison?  Allison?  Are you there?  Allison?  Well, she doesn't get to play now.  Uh-huh.  Stink.  All right.  Let's go to Robin on line five.  I hope Robin doesn't want to play.  I see a load of people that want to play.  You finally got it.  Jim from Vegas. 
[00:49:00]  What's going on?  What's going on, O.D.?  Hey, Jim.  You're our first contestant.  Sweet.  For the Oz game.  All right?  Right on.  You know how to play?  Yep.  Okay.  No, we have to do the first part first, Rick.  Okay, listen.  First part first.  Listen to this line from Oz, okay?  Okay.  And then we'll give you four choices and you have to figure out what the next line is going  to be.  Here we go.  Oh, you didn't ask my permission.  What are you going to learn, Frank? 
[00:49:30]  You belong to me.  I make all your decisions.  Right.  So ask me.  Come over here and ask me if you can f*** your wife.  Can I be with my wife?  F*** my wife.  F*** my wife.  Louder.  And say please and sir.  Please, sir.  May I f*** my wife?  Louder.  Please, sir. 
[00:50:00]  May I f*** my wife?  God, is that hot.  You are wrong.  That is hot in a twisted way right there, man.  The guy had to ask.  He was having a conjugal visit?  Yeah.  And his bunkmate and the guy that made him his bitch, Vern Schillinger, made him ask permission 
[00:50:30]  if during this conjugal visit he could go in and have sex with his wife.  Did the wife have to be there and see this interaction or no?  No, no.  Everyone on the block saw it, though.  On the cell block.  See, that would have been hotter if the wife was...  Right?  An eye shot?  This is already after Schillinger took Beecher, this guy that had to ask permission, and tattooed  a swastika on his ass. 
[00:51:00]  He took a pen and heated it up and just made a swastika on his ass.  There you go.  Really sick.  All right, Jim.  Ann's going to give you four choices.  You've got to figure out what the next line is, okay?  All right, I'm ready.  All right, can I F my wife was the last line we heard, and the answer Schillinger gave is  it, no, you can't.  Now suck my C.  B, no, my brother.  You've got to buy your own. 
[00:51:30]  C is C.  When you ask me like that, I can't deny you anything.  And D, hell, I like you.  You can come over to my house and F my sister.  I'm thinking A.  You're thinking A.  A, which would be, no, you can't now.  Suck my C.  All right.  Let's see what the answer is, Anthony.  All right.  See, when you ask me like that, I can't deny you anything.  Oh, Jim, it was C. 
[00:52:00]  It's not going to be easy like yesterday, huh?  Yeah.  Oh.  That was pretty easy if you think about it.  Well, the first answer, I mean, if I was the guy asking A is what I'd want to hear.  Right.  And Jim, we're not going to give you one.  I'm sorry because we came up with a great idea for the next Oz game.  So we need to save some of these DVDs, all right?  All right.  Fair enough.  I'm sorry, Jim.  That's cool.  Uh-huh.  Can we give him something else?  Like a little...  No.  All right.  We'll give you something else, though, Jim.  Hold on a line.  No, Norton rules.  All right.  See you, man.  Hey, I'm the one giving you the free stuff. 
[00:52:30]  All right.  Well, you rule, too.  All right.  Thanks.  I don't even care if he thinks I rule.  That's funny.  I'm not even going to try.  That's right.  We all need loving.  Rich, what's up?  From Columbus.  What's going on?  Hey, man.  Hey, you know, that last one sounded like Anthony talking to his girlfriend.  Oh.  What?  Oh.  No, my brother.  Let me see.  See, when you ask me like that, I can't ask you.  No, the last line before the...  Anthony, it's up to you.  I know.  Oh, hell, I like it.  If you were insulted, I will hang up on Rich.  Oh, that's okay. 
[00:53:00]  Oh.  Look at that.  Rich from Columbus.  He's going to let you slide on that one.  All right.  You know how to play?  Yes, I do.  All right.  Here's your line.  Here's the line.  Yo, yo, Italian ass.  What's up?  You ever hear how the word doo-wop came to pass?  Nah, man.  Tell me about it.  Where?  When we were in Harlem town, back in the old days, a couple of Italians were giving muscle  to a cat running a speakeys. 
[00:53:30]  It was doing a set, I think, maybe of Billie Holiday.  These Italians come into the club thinking they can push a brother around, but instead,  the brother finds her blood.  And outside in the alley, while Miss Billie Holiday is singing the blues, the brother  doo-wops.  And that's how doo-wop was born.  Wow. 
[00:54:00]  This just sounds like so much fun in prison, doesn't it?  All right, Rich from Columbus.  Here's your choices.  What's the next line?  Is the guy's response to that?  How would you like Johnny Poole's D up your A?  B, how would you like me to doo-wop your mooly ass?  C, well, excuse me, my Kraut Mick friend.  Or D, when you're telling these little stories, here's an idea.  Have a point. 
[00:54:30]  It makes it so much easier for the listener.  You didn't see E.  What was E?  My Garrett is an awesome Garrett.  All right, Rich from Columbus.  Rich, what's the next line?  All right, we're going to have to go with, even though I can barely hear it, but I'll go  with B.  B, how would you like me to doo-wop your mooly ass?  Sure, why not?  All right, let's hear if that's it.  How'd you like Johnny Poole's D up your A? 
[00:55:00]  Oh, God.  Oh, who would know if Johnny Poole's D up your A?  All right, Rich, we're going to give you something for trying, all right?  All right.  Hold on the line.  There goes Rich from Columbus.  I thought this was easy today.  I thought it was easier than yesterday.  I know.  Let's go to Long Island and say hi to Ciro.  Ciro, what's up today, man?  Yeah, it's Hero.  What?  Hero from Long Island.  What's up, guys?  What's up?  It says Ciro.  No, it's Hero.  All right, Hero.  Whatever.  That's an odd name. 
[00:55:30]  You ever run through Tel Aviv with a bomb strapped to you?  No, sorry.  It's just a nickname I got many years ago.  All right.  And why'd you get the nickname?  I saved the boat.  I was working at Davis Park.  I jumped on it and I saved it from sinking.  Hey, cool.  You're a hero.  Will we be the only sober person at Davis Park?  Pretty much.  Man, I've been there.  That's just a drunk fest.  So much fun.  Yeah.  All right, you ready to play the Oz game?  Oh, definitely.  All right, here's your line.  Hey, sweet pea. 
[00:56:00]  How was church, huh?  You feeling all sanctified and pure?  Get undressed.  We're taking a shower.  I already took a shower.  Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  All right, hero.  Yeah.  You got to figure out what the next line is, okay?  All right, the next line.  Okay.  After I already took a shower, does Vern Schillinger tell him, I don't give an F as a matter of fact.  You're going to clean my A with your tongue.  Jeez. 
[00:56:30]  B, well, that's okay.  When I'm done with you, you'll need another one.  C, oh, I'm sorry.  I didn't know.  Or D, all right.  How about...  All right, how about a steam?  You know, just two men in a steam room.  Hero, what's the next line?  How about a B?  B would be, well, that's okay.  When I'm done with you, you'll need another.  Okay, let's listen to the line. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, that's okay.  When I'm done with you, you'll need another one.  That's a winner.  We got our first winner today.  Hero from Rhode Island.  And let me just say,  You got a DVD copy of Oz,  a complete first season,  courtesy of HBO Home Video.  Thanks, guys.  Hold on the line, Hero.  Sure.  There he goes.  You're on your roof.  Thanks, buddy.  That is creepy, too,  because that implies you're about to get a facial. 
[00:57:30]  You're going to need another.  All right, we got three more today, Rick.  Oh, cool.  Three more to go today.  Let's go to Lindsay in Boston.  Hey, Lindsay, what's up today?  Hey, guys, how you doing?  Pretty good.  Hello.  How's all that fake radio going on?  Oh, yeah, you know.  I thought it was my radio.  Hey, shut up.  Shut up.  It's not fake.  Is Matty going to live through his surgery?  Jesus, man.  How far can you reach, Flocko? 
[00:58:00]  Everything they do is fake radio.  It's so funny.  It's like when wrestling,  before they came out and said that it was fake.  Remember those days when they actually  tried to present it like it was real?  It's like, oh, just at least come out  and just say, yeah, everything newbie is fake,  but I'm trying to be entertaining here.  Oh.  All right, sorry.  I got off track.  Lindsay.  You should give them a tip, too.  Yeah.  If you're going to have two hot lesbians  kissing on your website,  yeah, don't put a dude in the background. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, God.  No one wants to see the dude.  They think so much of themselves.  Yeah.  If you're going to listen to the O&A show  and decide that your show would be better suited  if you had, like, a lesbian for a day thing  and had the lesbian couch  and, you know, two girls going at it  and you take pictures of it  and put it up on a website.  Um, keep the guys out of it.  I don't think you'll find one photo  of when we have chicks together doing stuff  with us in the picture. 
[00:59:00]  You got to put your goofy, dope sidekick  in a picture of two chicks  getting all hot and stuff.  Like, it's not bad enough  that you got to have pictures of men  getting their asses spanked.  Oh, God.  Well, whatever.  Okay, Lindsey.  Yeah.  Hey, Lindsey.  How you doing, baby?  Yeah, you wearing a t-bag?  Bleh.  All right, Lindsey.  It's the Oz game. 
[00:59:30]  We're going to give you a line  and then you got to figure out  what the next line's going to be, okay?  Yep.  Here's your line.  Lindsey from Boston.  One of these Muslim monkeys  was trying to tell me  that Jesus was a nigger.  Even quoted from the Bible  trying to back his s*** up.  Well,  Jesus was from Judea  so he was probably  of an olive-colored skin.  Look at that picture there.  Does that look like a nigger to you?  No.  You're getting awful mouthy,  aren't you, Bragg? 
[01:00:00]  No, sir.  I am not, sir.  Yeah, I think I'm going to have  to teach you a lesson.  Oh, boy.  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Not a lesson.  What happened?  He was just dating  a religious pew.  Oh, boy.  All right, Lindsey.  Yep.  Is the next line  A,  polish my C with your tongue?  Is it B,  polish my boots with your tongue? 
[01:00:30]  Is it C,  brush your teeth with my C?  Or is it D?  How'd you like to mow my lawn, huh?  Uh-huh.  Going to go with B.  B?  All right, let's, uh...  Did you say B or G?  You said B, right?  All right, B.  Let's see what the line is.  Polish my boots  with your tongue.  Ah, yes. 
[01:01:00]  That's a winner.  That is Lindsey's answer.  And that is a winner  and you got a DVD copy of Oz.  Thank you very much.  And he...  First season.  He did get down  and on his knees  and started licking  Schillinger's boots.  Who plays that guy?  Who plays the guy  that's the boss guy?  What, the head?  Muckety-muckety-muckety?  The guy that's Schillinger?  The guy that you said  polish my boots.  Oh, God, I can't remember his name.  He sounds familiar.  Yeah.  All right, Lindsey, congrats.  Hold on the line, all right?  Thank you.  That's just what he said.  All right.  Let's go on to our next contestant.  You've heard that before? 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, you know,  I got a little lippy.  I had to be taught a lesson.  I think we only have  two more to go today, Anthony.  All right.  It's J.K. Simmons  is his name.  Yes.  Steve from New York.  Hey.  Ready to play the Oz game?  Yeah, definitely.  All right.  Here's your line, Steve.  In Oz, sometimes the things you can't touch  are more real than the things you can.  For instance, fear, hatred, loneliness  are more real to me than a shank.  And a soul.  Every day can grow into something 
[01:02:00]  you can almost hold.  Hmm.  I'm not too hip on the Augustus thing.  Monologue.  Cramp.  All right, let's get to the shank.  And there you go.  Steve, what's the next line?  Here's your choices.  Now, that's what I call some effed up S.  Now, can I get an amen?  How effed up is that in an S-hole like this?  Or a D...  I didn't give him the letters, did I?  Oh, well.  I'm the effing prince of darkness. 
[01:02:30]  Throw a lulk at him.  I'm going to go in.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Steve?  Hello?  Yeah.  Do you hear me?  No.  No.  All right, no.  Let's go.  I want to say, it doesn't feel like a plunger.  What, Steve?  But it doesn't feel anything like a plunger.  Which one are you going with there, sweetness?  That's D, right?  He's trying to make it. 
[01:03:00]  He puts on the lotion.  Oh, it's this guy.  I love that guy.  How it is all.  Okay.  He didn't play the game.  You know what?  He wasn't funny yesterday.  He wasn't today, but he's trying.  He's coming in at five.  All right, let's go all the way to the beginning.  We'll go to Pat in D.C.  Pat.  Hey, what's up?  You want to play the Oz game?  You know it.  All right, listen to the line again, and then Ant will give the choices and the answers and all that.  So here we go.  Jesus.  In Oz, sometimes the things you can't touch are more real than the things you can.  For instance, fear, hatred, loneliness are more real to me than a shank and a soul. 
[01:03:30]  Every day can grow into something you can almost hold.  Okay.  All right, Pat from D.C.  What's the next line?  Here's your choices.  A, now that's what I call some effed up S. B, now can I get an A man? C, how effed up is that in an S hole like this?  Or D, only effing Prince of Darkness. 
[01:04:00]  A?  A, which would be...  Now that's what I call some effed up S.  All right, let's listen to the line.  How effed up is that in a s*** hole like this?  Oh.  Oh.  I don't like that one, Rick.  No?  No.  That's okay.  It's a little too...  Oh.  You couldn't really figure it out.  I actually like it, Ant, because there's not a mule being forced on someone else or some boot licking. 
[01:04:30]  That's what the show's all about, man.  All right, Pat, we'll give you something for playing, all right?  Okay.  All right.  Our final contestant.  All right.  We'll go down to Philly and say hi to Andy.  Andy, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Ready for the Oz game?  You know it.  Everything good with you today?  Yes, it is.  You got your wow in your car?  No, I need a wow.  Oh.  I got soap written on wow.  Well, they're giving out the wow stickers down there in Philly.  Nice.  They'll be giving them out outside Norton's shows. 
[01:05:00]  Nice.  All right, you want to play the Oz game?  Yep.  Of course you do.  God bless.  Here's your line.  Mr. Woods, hey.  Yes, it's Mavis there.  She's out?  I don't know where she go.  What do you mean you can't tell me?  Don't tell me you don't know.  Get track and remove that girl mix.  Yeah, I'm calling you a liar, motherfucker, because you ain't telling me the truth.  Wow. 
[01:05:30]  What was that scene, eh?  That was one of the guys in the joint trying to call his chick.  Yep.  And apparently his chick was out.  Who answered?  And busy.  I think it was the chick's father.  Yeah.  All right, Andy.  Yeah.  You got to figure out what the next line is, okay?  Right on.  Here's your choice.  A, if you don't tell me right now, I'm going to effing kill you and her.  B, tell me where the eff Mavis is now. 
[01:06:00]  C, okay, can you just let her know I called?  Or D, who is your daddy and what does he do?  Uh, I'm going to go with A.  You're going to go with A.  I'm going to go with A.  If you don't tell me right now, I'm going to effing kill you and her.  All right, let's go to the next line.  Oh, hey, ho, hey, ho, hey, whoa, hey, ho, hey, we forgot to bleep that one. 
[01:06:30]  Whoop, hey, Andy heard it, hey.  Hello?  Is this thing on?  Yeah.  Wow.  Oh, that was great.  Rick forgot to bleep it.  Yeah.  Great.  My headphones pulled out when I ran for the dump button.  Oh, okay.  Why, you can't say that?  No.  No, no, you can't say that.  Well, Rick, what are we going to do?  Andy, did you hear that?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:07:00]  The people on the phones get to hear everything.  Oh, you dick, Rick.  That was great.  Well, I'll try to pot it down.  All right.  So what was your choice again?  I picked A.  Hey.  You picked A.  Let's go with the answer.  Here we go.  Oh, boy.  Oh, good luck.  I know.  Agree.  Tell me where the F.  This is not.  There you go.  I got it.  All right.  I got it.  Tell me where the F.  Mavis is now. 
[01:07:30]  Although, can I say about this guy, this guy, even after he heard it, was still honest  and gave the wrong answer.  Right.  Yeah.  Look at that.  He could have said, why?  He could have.  I'm stupid like that.  Andy's cool.  Andy, we'll give you something for playing, all right?  Nice.  You guys rule.  All right.  Thanks for playing the Oz game.  Yeah.  We only got one winner today.  That's it.  We have two winners today.  How many more DVDs we got left?  We got four to go, Anthony.  The third round of the Oz game, we're going to change the whole damn thing. 
[01:08:00]  I think a listener came up with a great idea, right?  We're going to give you some audio.  This will be either tomorrow or Friday.  We're going to give you some audio, and you've got to figure out who's getting effed.  Wow.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeesh.  Making it a little more interesting.  Maybe we can just bring a few guys up in a studio, you know, and do a little method acting.  Wacky radio fact alert from No Bones in Jersey. 
[01:08:30]  The guy that plays Schillinger is also the voice of the yellow M&M.  How disturbing is that?  He's plowing a man in prison, and he's the yellow M&M.  We like those little facts from time to time.  At least he's not the frosted side of the mini-wheat.  No, but his friend's back is.  Oh, wow.  Little, little, little, and the took his joke. 
[01:09:00]  Hudler.  Rich Voss coming in at five.  We've got a little surprise for him.  Why don't we go to the FU line and see what's going on there?  Someone said that's going against the rules of radio comedy.  What?  And radio rules that our funniest stuff should be in the five o'clock hour.  Having Voss come in at five.  Like we said yesterday, we're mixing it up.  You're mixing it up.  Got to keep you guys honest.  All right, here's the FU line.  Thanks for calling, and here's the Opie and Anthony FU line.  Yeah, if I could send a big FU out to the Academy Awards and all of f***ing Hollywood, 
[01:09:30]  I had to sit there and watch the goddamn Academy Awards on Sunday at my girlfriend's house.  And I had to sit there and just be quiet and watch these f***ing morons all night long.  Joan Rivers.  Oh, what are you bailing?  F*** yourself, you moron.  Shut up.  Who cares, dick face?  I'm wearing Kmart, bitch.  You old f***ing whore.  I mean, goddamn Halle Berry, you f***ing lunatic.  It's amazing how you can run someone over in f***ing Hollywood, 
[01:10:00]  and then people forget about it.  Like, she's the greatest thing in the goddamn world.  You should be sitting in jail, getting railed up the f***ing ass f***ing every day,  you stupid bitch, with your fat Irish mother, you f***ing whore.  You miserable ass f***ing.  You think that's important in Academy Awards?  You've got to get a grip on your f***ing life.  What's important is the firefighters and the true people that work every day and police and people that work nine-to-five regular jobs that don't get any recognition and hardly get any f***ing money, you idiot. 
[01:10:30]  So go in your SUV and drive up a f***ing cliff and die or they f***ing hate you.  And Julia Roberts, shut your big goddamn mouth already with your stupid, humble acts, you moron.  I f***ing hate you, too.  I hope you get painful breast cancer and f***ing die.  Go to hell, all of you Hollywood idiots.  Come back to the real world and realize that what you're doing is worthless and useless,  and you shouldn't be getting paid anything.  And f*** you, Tom Cruise, you faggot, hook-nosed bitch.  Oh, don't sue me for my $300 I have in the bank, you f***. 
[01:11:00]  Go to hell.  End of message.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Come on.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including Cleveland today.  866-277-4WOW.  That's 866-277-4WOW.  It is Whip Them Out Wednesday.  Get the WOW in your goddamn car.  What's that, Norton? 
[01:11:30]  What's that?  What, Jim?  What's that?  Disposable Teens.  Marilyn Manson.  Oh, it is Marilyn Manson.  Okay.  Marilyn Manson.  We will be featured with Marilyn Manson on Thursday?  Tomorrow night.  Tomorrow night?  Yes, on the O'Reilly Fact.  Actually, it's not the O'Reilly Fact.  It's O'Reilly's, what's this thing called?  Corruption of the American Child or Youth?  Youth?  What the hell is it called?  Youth.  I know they're promoing the hell out of it.  Someone on Instant Feedback will send it in on Fox, and I think we're going to get about 
[01:12:00]  three minutes of FaceTime.  That's what I think.  About ten seconds will be me staring blankly in the camera going,  Why do you do the things you do?  It's very detrimental, I believe, to the youth of America.  Shut up.  Shut up.  You're tall.  Then when he came, they have a sit down.  We taped this thing, I don't even know, like several months ago. 
[01:12:30]  Fifteen years ago, we taped it.  It was before 9-11.  Yeah.  Huh?  That was in July, was it?  August.  August.  It was supposed to air in September.  Right.  It was supposed to air in September.  Then September 11th, you know, plans changed for O'Reilly.  And now he's getting back to, uh...  Remember you and I, we went, phew.  Yeah.  We're like, okay, we thought it was that bull.  God.  They'll never air that thing.  Now it's airing Thursday.  Thursday on the regular Fox.  Marilyn Manson, Insane Clown Posse, Linda McMahon from WWF, Russell Simmons. 
[01:13:00]  And it's all going to be Bill O'Reilly talking about how horrible this is for the children.  Now, why would you talk about the Olsen twins in such a way that would...  Because they're hot, Bill.  Well, I think you're cold, watch because they're hot.  Yeah, I was like, ah, come on.  Who cares?  I was better than mine.  Uh, uh, I don't know.  Opie did his best butthead impression for Bill O'Reilly.  Opie, I have a question for you.  This Whip-Em-Out Wednesday, do you think it's right for women to flash when children could be watching? 
[01:13:30]  Uh, uh, you're tall and stupid.  Uh, uh, uh, Bill O'Reilly.  So then I go to all the people that went down with us.  I'm like, you don't think they're going to use that, are you?  Oh, yeah.  They're like, they're definitely using that.  Any chance to make you guys look stupid?  Of course they're going to use that.  So we're sitting there and then, of course, they bring in, uh, Bill O'Reilly. 
[01:14:00]  And we're sitting down in these little seats.  I felt like I was back in, uh, grammar school.  I know.  They're like kindergarten seats.  We have these little seats.  He's on this huge stool.  And, like, he walks in.  Hello, I'm Bill O'Reilly.  I felt like I was talking to the principal.  Oh, no, he's a giant.  He's going to yell at us and he's a big guy.  I felt like we got caught smoking.  Yeah.  Yeah, we were in the principal's office.  I'm calling your mother.  Oh, we'll see what happens.  Bill O'Reilly.  It's going to be, um, yeah, tomorrow, what? 
[01:14:30]  Nine, what time?  Nine?  Nine o'clock?  Nine-ish.  Nine.  Uh, it's going to be over at nine o'clock.  Oh, nine-ish.  Pete, what's going on?  Hey, uh, are you tools ever, uh, going to do the road show in Cleveland?  Or are you just coming to visit and see Norton's show?  We're, um, this is what we do.  We're going out there just to kind of take a peek.  No, man, road show all the way.  Reconnaissance first.  Look, sir, I realize my show isn't the event of the century, but you don't have to mention it like it's a vomit fest. 
[01:15:00]  It's not a vomit fest, Norton.  It rules.  I'm driving all the way from Columbus to go up to my brother's man's stay the weekend.  What will happen, we'll be broadcasting live from the station so you guys can kind of hang out there.  And then, uh, we'll do some things at Norton's show.  And we're just going to kind of take a peek, see what's going on up there.  Bring some fresh Cleveland wars with me.  All right, cool.  Oh, thanks, tools.  Later.  Hey, Norton.  Never going to work, sir.  No, no, no, no, I had a question.  Then you may ask the question.  Legitimate question.  Wow.  Ignore me.  Here you go.  It didn't work.  See?  It didn't work.  It did not work.  Of course it didn't.  I am ruling that that absolutely didn't work. 
[01:15:30]  Oh, I wouldn't lie.  If someone gets me, I'm just, uh, I'm, you know, whatever.  But no, that didn't work.  John.  I'll never be gotten again, by the way.  Yeah.  Oh, see, now you're just setting yourself up.  No, I'm not.  Maybe not today.  It's a possibility.  John, what's going on?  Too good.  Hey, I'm just here in Austin, Texas, looking for some cans.  Austin.  We got a lot of calls from Austin, Opie.  You notice that?  Yeah, I'm starting to notice that.  We're on the juice down there in Austin.  The little juice.  Uh, the wild thing takes time, my friend.  You guys only had the Opie and Anthony show for, I don't know, I think three or four days now. 
[01:16:00]  Mm-hmm.  Three or four days.  Not long.  Give it time.  I think by next Wednesday, we're going to really start pushing WOW again, so.  Outstanding.  Get ready, but if you want to do something, get WOW in your car immediately, okay?  There you go.  Later.  All right, bye.  Thank you, Austin, Texas.  All right.  Uh, one more, and then we got to talk about Star Jones.  Star Jones.  Mike, what's going on?  Yo, what's up?  Hey.  O'Reilly sucks.  Makes me sick, that guy.  The rest of them, Fox News, the rest of those guys.  Fox News.  Bill O'Reilly, I am Rock Quarry. 
[01:16:30]  I am Rock Quarry.  You may remember me from The Dancing Playboy.  Maybe Dr. Jekyll's Hyde.  Ah.  Hmm.  I don't like being Bill O'Reilly anymore.  I'm going to be Gus Schultz.  I'll be able to blend in with the crowd.  I'll go bowling with Fred and Barney.  I'll tell them who I am.  Hmm. 
[01:17:00]  I think I'm going to tell Fred and Barney I'm Bill O'Reilly.  They'll get a big kick out of it.  Guys, I'm Bill O'Reilly.  He says he's Bill O'Reilly, Fred.  Okay, Barney.  I just do the fake Fred after he died.  We love the fake Fred.  Fake Fred after he died.  I love fake Fred.  Do you hate that?  You know what I'm talking about, right?  Yeah, it's done.  That's my favorite Anthony impression, though.  The fake Fred.  When Fred Flintstone...  Out of all the ones he does, this is the best one.  What's his name?  Reed? 
[01:17:30]  The guy that...  No, no.  Whatever his name was.  Old Batchback.  Alan.  I think it was Alan Reed that did the voice of Fred Flintstone.  He died.  But, of course, they continued doing the Flintstones.  And Barney was Mel Blanc, and he was still alive.  So you'd hear Barney's voice, you know.  Hey, Fred, you want to go bowling?  And then you'd get,  Okay, Barney.  I'll get my bowling ball.  You're like, what?  What the?  That's not Fred.  Who the?  Who the?  That isn't...  That was a little off.  Who the f... 
[01:18:00]  And it would piss you off, even as a kid.  All right, Mike, what do you have?  Hey, Wilma.  I don't know.  He's telling you guys it's dangerous.  That annoys me.  The most dangerous thing that can happen to a 15-year-old kid listening to your show  is they'll end up chasing the balloon out a little early.  What?  That's about it.  I don't understand what he said, Opie.  All right.  The most dangerous thing that can happen to a 15-year-old kid listening to your show  is chasing the balloon out just a little early.  I enjoy Mike Schumer.  I think it's nice.  Nice, right?  Thank you, Mike.  Thanks, Mike.  The problem with those shows is they make normal people think...  Ugh.  All right.  They make normal people think you can contemplate about the war and stuff, and then you have 
[01:18:30]  to get a 16-year-old kid that flies a plane into a building because he thinks he knows  something about a sound of a lot.  It's dangerous.  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  One more thing.  No, no, no, no.  No, no, no.  I'm going to save you.  Godspeed, son.  Tuttle from New York writes, an O'Reilly Factor special, The Corruption of the American Child.  The Corruption of the American Child.  That's the name of the special, and then...  I'll call my special The Corruption of the American Child.  And then Tuttle writes, thanks for corrupting me, dicks.  Yeah.  All right.  What's going on with Star Jones, Ant? 
[01:19:00]  She went to Jamaica for her 40th birthday?  She is a fat pig.  Ah.  She decided she was going to fly, I think, 40 friends to Jamaica for her 40th birthday.  Well, you know something?  When you're a diva, when you're a diva like Star Jones, because who's called Star Jones  a diva?  Hmm.  Let me think.  Oh, yeah.  Star Jones.  When you're a diva and you turn 40, you've got to have a huge, big, pompous birthday party. 
[01:19:30]  I thought you were going to say buffet.  Well, yeah, I do, it seems.  So, she flew 40 fab friends to Montego Bay, Jamaica, for her 40th birthday party.  Yeah.  Jamaica.  So, there was like blunts and bunts down there with Star Jones.  I'm smoking a blunt, and look at my bunts.  It's huge. 
[01:20:00]  Her friends included Kim Cattrall, Lorraine Bracco, Denise Rich, Natalie Cole, of course,  Lisa Ling, and Jason Williams' wife, Tanya.  Really?  Well, she needed a vacation from Jason.  Please read the first line, and this is why I want most media people to stand.  Yeah.  This is the first line.  Oh, oh, Star Jones was Jamaicanum crazy.  Oh, oh, oh. 
[01:20:30]  Oh.  Oh.  So, they went down to Jamaica and had a little birthday party.  And Star ran out of food.  They were on a cruise ship.  And Star Jones ran out of, I ran out of food.  I want to talk to somebody.  How come I ran out of food for my party before the guests got there?  What happened?  She gave out a little gift package also.  Yeah.  See, Star Jones, it's her party, Opie, but she's giving. 
[01:21:00]  She's always giving.  Some of the freebies in the gift packs, some John Perignon champagne, Michael Kors perfume,  Sean John silk robes, Armani makeup, all these name things.  Because I'm a diva.  I like to pamper myself.  You ever see the segment she does on the show?  Star Jones pampers herself.  Now, you know something?  Well, I haven't. 
[01:21:30]  I know what you're going to say.  I don't watch The View.  But there are times I will be flipping the channels.  Are you going to talk about the earwax thing?  The earwax removal.  Star Jones, I'll ask to pamper myself.  Wow.  And they got to sit there.  The comedian, what's her name?  I wouldn't know.  You know the conjo.  Joy Behoff.  Okay.  On the show, Lisa Ling, and then the soccer mom.  Meredith.  Meredith.  Baxter.  And they all look at her.  They all look at her like, oh, Star, tell us how you pamper yourself. 
[01:22:00]  And how, you know, you get your man.  And Star will go on about how she thinks Denzel's all hot.  Denzel.  Let me lay the word out to Denzel, honey.  If you're watching Denzel, I am available.  To what?  Move his furniture, you linebacker?  Like Denzel is going to look and go, hmm, that's Star Jones.  Mm-hmm.  Screw that Halle Berry.  I want Star Jones. 
[01:22:30]  I want Star Jones.  Hmm.  So, uh, silk robes.  What else?  I'm not going to make up Ralph Lauren duffel bags.  Kate Spade travel bags.  Payless slippers.  What about this McDonald's thing, Anthony?  Well, I'll get to that.  Oh, I'm sorry.  It's because they ran out of food.  I just want to talk about her Payless commercials, too.  Have you seen these, Jim?  Oh, you don't have a TV.  That's right.  I'm getting one.  Okay.  I've been moving.  Congratulations.  That'll help the show.  Yeah.  You're actually watching TV before you come in here.  Knowing something about what's going on in the world. 
[01:23:00]  Knowing things are nice.  You're right.  Someday I'm going to come in here Pete prepared.  You're going to be Pete prepared.  That's good.  Someone's calling me when they know I'm on the air.  Hang up, stupid.  I'm not answering.  That's a good answer.  Have you seen her Payless ads on TV?  Yes, I have.  She's laying on the grass.  They're kind of cute.  She's laying on the grass, and they do every camera angle so you can't see her body. 
[01:23:30]  Her big, fat head is actually blocking her body in the commercials.  Yet, you can see her lift her feet up.  So, behind her head, you see the Payless shoes.  And I'm like, why?  Okay, Sarge Jones likes things like Dom Perignon, and there's Armani, and everything.  Why is she hawking Payless?  Because she goes through a pair of shoes a day.  It's the weight.  She can't afford the expensive ones in. 
[01:24:00]  Right.  Every day.  Let me give you a little example.  You can do this experiment at home.  Don't do it if you're a child below 18, because it could be dangerous.  Here's the abuse Sarge Jones shoes take on a daily basis.  Tie yourself to the back of a car, okay?  Put on your shoes.  Hold something that weighs about 300, 400 pounds.  Now, tell the guy to drive at about 60 miles an hour.  Watch your shoes wear away under your feet. 
[01:24:30]  You can watch them.  You look and go, wow, my shoes are actually wearing away.  Ah!  When it gets to your feet.  That's her walking.  Pumps to flats in four hours.  Pumps to flats in four hours.  I can actually notch off a time factor on my heels.  Get up big.  Remember those big pink erasers from school?  Scrape that on asphalt.  That's what my shoes go through.  I started the morning at 5'6".  I'm now 5'2".  That's why I got to go to Payless.  Kids, really, don't stop yourself because you got to say to kids something first. 
[01:25:00]  Waddle doodle, why'd you say a car and not a truckie?  Bone dry, waddle doodle, can't get a job there.  On the Grease Rancho.  Yeah, the big pink erasers.  Remember those things?  Yeah, from school.  You saw in school?  Yeah.  The big pink eraser.  Take one of those, okay?  Go out to a sidewalk and hold it down hard and rub it for an entire block and watch how much wears away. 
[01:25:30]  Those are the souls of Star Jones shoes.  That's why she needs to pay less shoes.  All right.  Also, she gave away a copy of, get this, Kim Cattrall's sex guide from Sex and the City.  Satisfaction, the Art of the Female Orgasm.  Usually that sounds really hot.  Just because you played, what was her name, Lassie on Porky's, remember? 
[01:26:00]  Oh, that was her.  And she's on Sex and the City as the whore.  I mean, doesn't mean she knows anything about the sex.  But she's good friends with Star Jones, so that's why her book was in there.  And this item is just something that I think is going to end up on eBay that was in the little gift bag.  It's a cleaned chicken bone from Star Jones herself.  She cleaned it like a piranha cleaning a friggin' ox bone in the rivers of the Amazon. 
[01:26:30]  My party.  They had to go to McDonald's.  Here's our big, posh 40th birthday party on the Zine.  It's Prince Rainier's yacht.  And they ran out of food.  What happened out of food?  Stay away.  That they had to go to McDonald's. 
[01:27:00]  I love to McDonald's.  That's the last thing Star Jones needs.  When she is sitting on that couch and you see that emaciated Lisa Ling and the soccer mom and all.  Barbara Walters with the big head on the skinny body.  And you just see Star Jones sitting there.  It's like one of these things is not like the other.  Her eating a sub must look like when Jaws was swallowing Quint.  That's great.  Look, that's why I'm having my party out on a boat.  I'm going to jump in the water.  Each of you get in a shark cage and I'll swim around it. 
[01:27:30]  Scary.  That's scary.  Drink to your leg.  Uncle John.  Have my guests pledge that they would never put on a life jacket again.  And then the piece de resistance at the end of my party.  I flop up on the stern of the boat and sink it.  And one of my guests fall into my mouth and I chew them in half.  Then I swallow a scuba tank.  Someone shoots it and I explode.  And that's why Jaws too short.  Uncle John, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  They should change their name from star to solar system. 
[01:28:00]  Or black hole.  Jim Norton, April 18th, town hall.  Bye.  Thank you, John.  It's still not sold out?  I'm chilling.  Look at this license plate I coughed up.  I must have swum up from the southern warm waters on the Gulf Stream.  It's a Louisiana license plate, ain't it?  And look, here comes that little kid in the boy.  What?  Not enough shrimp cocktail?  I bought 60 tons and only strained so much through my baleen.  Come on, it's a whale joke. 
[01:28:30]  Go to the Museum of Natural History, you ignorant eff.  I got the whale joke.  I know.  All right.  I heard she coughed and Bo Derrick's leg fell out.  That's an orca reference.  Yes.  Maybe it would have been funny if I didn't say Bo Derrick.  It's Derrick, chinless.  A little thin-lipped nothing.  I think you did say Derrick, but the bagel was in your mouth.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm eating again.  The listeners have been complaining about that.  Look what I did to Ben Gardner.  Look at his eyeball. 
[01:29:00]  It scares people.  I left a tooth in this boat.  Wow.  That's good.  That's even better than my You Killed Will Sampson reference.  Here comes Star Jones.  Oh, I knew that little kid in the boy should have gotten out of the water.  He just wanted to take one more little dip.  There he is.  I see his little raft.  Look at his little feet kicking.  I could swallow him whole.  Little tenderizing down he goes. 
[01:29:30]  Forty guests in the water.  Star Jones in the water.  Around nighttime comes, Star Jones come cruising.  Starts circling.  That's when you hear the high-pitched screaming and hollering.  And they'd be pounding and pounding.  But Star Jones don't go away.  Star's hungry.  There's no food on the boat.  I got to eat my guests. 
[01:30:00]  About five o'clock, another guest saw one of the other guests.  Went up to him.  Tap him on the shoulder.  Thought he was sleeping.  It capsized, bobbed up.  He'd been bitten in half by the waist.  By Star Jones.  She ate everything to pay less shoes.  Next day, a big old PBY comes flying over.  Oh, my God.  That's when I was most scared, my guests.  They didn't think they would.  They thought it was their turn for Star Jones to bite him in half. 
[01:30:30]  After that party, my guests never put on a life jacket again.  Some guests said they once saw me eat a rocking chair once.  Swallowed it whole.  Star Jones can't go down with three barrels in her.  Not with three.  Uh-uh.  Three Big Macs in her. 
[01:31:00]  Stupid mayor said it's the 4th of July and these beaches will stay open.  I don't care.  Plenty of food for me, Star Jones.  They got pictures from a party and stuff?  Yeah, you can go to her website.  That's great.  Very good.  I'm territorial till the food run out.  Then I leave.  I go somewhere else.  That's what the marine biologist quit.  Whatever his name was.  Hooper.  Hooper.  Hooper. 
[01:31:30]  Ain't you watching it, Hooper?  All right.  We got to take a break, Ed.  Yeah.  Rich Voss is here.  We got a little surprise for him.  And Anastasia wants to do something real fast.  Oh.  Anastasia.  Hey.  What's going on?  O and A.  Where are you calling from?  You guys are great.  What?  From the nation's capital.  D.C.  You got it.  And what do you want to do for us today?  Well, you know, every day I listen to you guys coming home and I hear these ladies coming 
[01:32:00]  going on, doing the big O.  Yeah.  Hey.  They don't even have it right.  Uh-huh.  Well, we're trying to get this five o'clock fake O thing happening.  Right.  Laura wants to do it, too, though, on the other line.  Hold on a second here.  Laura, what's up?  Hey.  What's up?  Where are you calling from?  I'm calling from Westchester, New York.  We got a New York girl and a D.C. girl.  That's right.  That's right.  We got to go with the New Yorkers.  We know what we're doing over here.  What do you want to do, Ant? 
[01:32:30]  I don't know.  Should we have a fake O-off?  Wait.  Wait.  Rick doesn't like one of them.  I don't like either one of them.  Why?  Wow, Rick.  Rick.  You sound horrible.  I think Anastasia sounds pretty horrible.  Well, I'm not.  You know, I'm not a radio voice.  I'm just, you know.  It doesn't matter.  I sound like a chick.  I can talk to some of the girls that you've had before, so.  Rick, she's just an hour.  I thought I'd stop and give it a try.  Yeah.  Rick is really giving you the riot act.  Yeah, Rick.  She was nice enough to call the show.  We're trying to be nicer to the ladies.  We want them calling our show.  Be nice and hang up. 
[01:33:00]  Rick.  We still want to hang up on you.  Get on mic, Rick.  I don't understand what Rick's problem is.  Maybe he just got up on the wrong side of the dad.  Don't ever say that again.  See, just saying that disqualifies her.  There's no way she can moan very hot at that.  I thought that sounded very cute, Anastasia.  Oh, yes.  You can say that any time.  She's trying to put together sentences.  That was a nice sentence.  Oh?  She's going to do the oh.  Yeah, Rick.  She wants to do the fake oh, not explain the theory of relativity.  All right, Anastasia? 
[01:33:30]  Yeah.  Let's hear you first.  Laura, you stay there, okay?  Okay.  All right.  Anastasia, whenever you're ready.  Okay.  Do you know how we like this?  Slow and easy?  It's got to start slow, nice.  It's got to build to a crescendo.  And one thing we don't like is when it sounds fake.  Oh, baby.  It can't sound fake.  It's a fake oh, but it can't sound fake.  Does it have to be a fake oh?  No.  Yes, we have to say it's a fake oh.  It's very fake. 
[01:34:00]  It's fake.  It's totally fake, but make it sound as authentic as you can.  Well, I'll tell you that it's a fake oh, because, oh, because, you know, because it's feeling good.  All right.  And, oh, yeah, that's it.  It is so good.  So nice.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Ooh.  Ooh.  I can feel it.  Feel it. 
[01:34:30]  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  That's it.  All right.  That's it.  Yeah.  Ooh.  Oh, boy.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  You got me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, you like that.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Oh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  It's it.  It's it.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[01:35:00]  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Oh, God.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh.  That was nice.  Ooh.  You belong in the dump in Staten Island.  All right.  Can I say that that was about as sexy as the fluid from Dudley Moore's Bunions? 
[01:35:30]  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  You took it.  Oh, wow.  Oh, club bunions.  All right, Anastasia.  Thank you.  Sure.  All right.  There you go.  Good call, Rick.  Laura Pudertoot said it sounded like Rue McClenahan having it.  Oh.  Rue McClenahan.  Sounds like the fake dump. 
[01:36:00]  All right, Laura.  Yes.  You think you can do better than D.C. today?  I'm sure going to try.  I'm a little nervous.  I'm in my car.  I'm pulled to the side.  But I'm definitely, I think I can definitely do a little bit better than that.  You know, if I can't, then I really feel sorry for myself.  But, all right.  Here we go.  Whenever you're ready.  We're ready.  Oh.  Ooh.  Yeah, right there.  A little bit to the left.  Directions. 
[01:36:30]  Faster.  I'm not a fan of directions.  I'll figure it out.  Oh.  Uh-huh.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[01:37:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  All right, Laura, thank you.  That was much better than the third one, though.  You pink hitty-bitty.  All right, that was a good comeback there, right? 
[01:37:30]  All right, there goes Laura from Westchester, I think.  You stupid faggot.  This is Frenchy.  All right, so that bit needs a little work.  Yeah.  A little bit.  A little bit.  All right, Rich Voss is next, right?  A little bit.  A little bit now.  A little surprise for Rich Voss.  Mm-hmm.  Soften them a little bit.  How old are you?  18.  All right, for your show, you're doing well.  Fabulous.  Wow.  Holy ravioli.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:38:00]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show and a little taste of corn here to stay.  Bunch of girls calling in.  They're very pissed off at the fake O's we just had on the radio.  Why are they pissed?  They think they can do better?  Christine, exactly.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  What's up?  What's up?  Christine, do us a favor.  Uh-huh.  You're one of many girls that are on hold right now.  Just call back tomorrow or the next day and, you know.  No.  And show us what you got.  No, no, no.  This is going to happen now. 
[01:38:30]  Okay?  Man, if she sucks, though, then this is...  Wow, she's very demanding.  All right, go ahead, Christine, real fast.  Okay.  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  What?  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  She was the greatest piece of ass I've ever had. 
[01:39:00]  I've not heard him all over the world.  Sweet.  Was it good?  That was pretty good, Christine.  Yeah, wrong name. 
[01:39:30]  You don't use names in it.  God.  Sounds like Patrice eating.  Did you cut that?  Yeah, we got that one.  Thank you.  You can use certain names.  Maybe not Oprah, but they also have friends.  I'm sorry, but his voice turns me on.  I'm sorry.  Oh.  Thank you.  All right, Christine, we've got to move on.  Very good.  All right.  I think we redeemed ourselves a little bit there.  Right?  Yeah.  Rich Voss in the studio.  I hope she falls into a crushed glass pile.  Listen.  Jason, what's going on?  Hey, guys, I just wanted to know. 
[01:40:00]  I'm taking a wild stab in the dark here, but is the surprise for the force?  You actually found tape of him saying something funny?  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Hey, Anthony, I know this is late about this Oz thing, but how good is his name Beecher look  when he was singing at the talent show in front of the cafeteria?  Yes.  Do you remember that part where they dressed him up?  Dressed up like a bitch.  Man.  You thought he was hot?  Well, I mean, you know, for prison.  For prison and on a Wednesday. 
[01:40:30]  Right.  You know, you save it for the weekend.  I watched that three hours in a row.  I bought the DVD.  Yeah.  Three hours the first night, three hours the second night.  Yeah.  You got it.  You like the Oz game we're playing?  Oh, it's great.  Yeah.  The new version of the game is going to rock.  I knew somebody.  It was great when he said, lick my, clean my boots.  Yeah.  And he did it.  Oh, my.  That's awful.  Dude, I've never seen a full episode of Oz and the Sopranos.  I'm going to buy them on DVD days.  Of course you have it.  And shut up that you say you're going to do this.  No, I want to.  You were getting raped on the bus on the way to prison. 
[01:41:00]  Shut up with your stupid material.  Why are you yelling?  Doing Polish stuff on the Colin Cling Show.  Why are you yelling at me?  Polish material.  Shut up.  And the operative word is on the Colin Cling Show.  Exactly stupid.  Where were you doing your brilliant stuff?  What gig in Connecticut?  Polish.  Shut up.  Polish.  They cut him out.  By the way, they cut him.  He goes right for the juice bar.  You dope.  They Polish.  They cut him out.  Oh, yeah.  Of course they did.  He makes Keanu Reeves look like Olivier. 
[01:41:30]  He's awful.  The emotional range of an autistic, you ass.  He did a sketch for Colin Quinn.  And it was, you know, it was good.  It just ran a little long.  That's the only problem.  Yeah, no, they don't want all the best sketches on the network show.  They figure, cut the good ones.  That's the only way it works.  Shut up, fifth wheel.  I didn't want to argue with Voss. 
[01:42:00]  I'm Voss with my favorite people.  He's just worried that certain photos are going to be brought out here.  Of course.  But, Jim, did you ever make history?  Right.  Like Voss?  Huh?  Rich Voss.  A couple times.  I've made history a couple times.  I think I actually have.  I've actually hung out with him the longest without throwing up thinking about him.  Rotten little man you are.  Voss is mean.  I'm not mean.  I'm a real nice guy. 
[01:42:30]  That's why I know you're not nice.  I'm a nice guy.  And if I find a nice girl, I'd make a nice boyfriend.  I'm a nice guy.  You're garbage.  You would not be a good...  All he does is, like, you think she'd want to go out with me?  Yeah, she wants to give a Hummer to a middle-aged man and then be booted out of the car.  You're perfect.  You have an awful boyfriend.  No, I'm not.  Oh, he is a womanizing scumbag.  Are you?  Really?  Yeah, and I mean, we all like to womanize, all right?  But he is a dirtbag.  Oh, mighty.  Have some peanuts.  I always walk him down and I talk to him in front of the desk guy so that they can't claim 
[01:43:00]  I raped him.  That's what this...  What?  Which actually, for me, is brilliant.  When you're in a hotel...  Oh, my God.  When you're in a hotel, say you pick up a girl on the road.  Not that I do that anymore, but say you pick up a girl.  Right.  And you're leaving a hotel.  You don't want to be like Tyson.  So you walk up to the desk and go to the guy, what time is it?  And he sees that you're laughing together, smiling and the whole thing.  Right.  You know, that's if you don't have your recorder.  What the hell are you doing that you have to think?  I know.  Like, I have never even thought that you would need alibis and backing up by the desk guy. 
[01:43:30]  Because, you know, we're famous comics on the road.  And girls want to, you know, make some trash.  Is that what it is?  Do you, like, grab her by the side and pinch and go, say something nice to the effing man.  Just hold it back to her neck.  Say you're having a good time.  Anything like that?  Or do they have to say, hi, I had fun.  He didn't rape me.  Good night.  Say it.  Say it like I f***ing told you to say it, bitch.  Say you had fun and everything went okay.  You wanted it, you f***ing whore. 
[01:44:00]  You know you did.  What was the good old picture?  I raped my date and now I'm dodging it.  You know what?  I got a dryer door.  I'm going to hit some f*** over the head with it.  Oh, hey, things are slow.  It's the middle of the week.  Let's bring Boston and trash them.  Hey, honey, take your laughing pants off and put your rape pants on. 
[01:44:30]  That is on your website, you know.  What?  To put your laughing pants on.  I haven't talked to some.  Oh, no, it's on laugh.com.  Oh, laugh.com?  Yeah, it describes your CD.  It says, put your laughing pants on.  No, it does.  No, it does.  He's disgusting.  Put your laughing pants on.  No, it does not.  It does not.  I didn't think they would print that when I told them to do that. 
[01:45:00]  Take your laughing pants and you run the roos off, you little bitch.  Oh, man.  Hey, boss, can you tell the hotel story that you told us at the restaurant the other night?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You can?  Am I allowed to tell that?  Yeah, I can tell.  Yeah, I just don't know if the chick's listening.  That's all.  Oh, she might be on.  Ah, you ruined it, Opie.  He was great.  What's the hotel story?  Just tell it.  It's a scam he does.  It's hilarious.  No, it wasn't a scam.  Well, a one-time scam.  That, uh...  That's what he did.  Come on.  You're going to be a good boyfriend someday. 
[01:45:30]  I meet this girl.  You can do what Old Dirty did two weeks ago and say it was for the radio.  Ah, right.  All right.  That this was a fake story.  It is fake.  Yeah.  All right.  So, you know, we meet up at the club, and then we go to eat, and we're in the parking  lot, right, and we're making out in the parking lot of the diner, and you say, well,  I don't really want to do this in a diner, parking lot, so I go, okay, and I pull next  door into the car wash, and we're making out there.  Because I like to get my car washed so there's witnesses.  So, well, it was nighttime. 
[01:46:00]  I'm not doing any day gigs.  She was still alive at what time?  And we had to go, oh, okay, so then we go, I said, well, I know there's a hotel.  It's kind of, you know, inexpensive.  So, we pull into the hotel, you know, and it's like, no cars there.  No cars.  Key to the story.  Had you already finished once?  No, I didn't finish.  No cars whatsoever.  No cars.  No cars.  Key to the story.  Key to the story.  No cars.  Okay.  And then I say, we're sitting in the car, we're fooling around, I go, you know, can  you watch me do things with myself before we go in, you know? 
[01:46:30]  Right?  She says, okay.  And so I do things with myself, you know, as I touch her a little.  And you're done with the things.  And I'm done with the things.  And then I go, okay, so, like, I walk in, and there's no cars.  And I come out, and I go, they're all sold out.  You used her as a three-dimensional playboy or something.  It's like, there's like no cars there.  And, right, she goes, well, where is it? 
[01:47:00]  I go, well, it's like one of those welfare hotels.  They don't have cars.  But you know what the hell, let's get out of here.  It's late and stuff.  And, you know, it's not a big deal.  I mean, you know.  Right.  That's a good story.  I'm not going to pay, you know, $40 and finish that quick and just sit there and go,  I hate this and I want to leave.  So, I got to take that chance in the car by myself and see if I, you know, get excited again to do it again.  So, you just crank as you're looking at her nude or something.  Well, not partially.  Or topple, you got your hand, whatever. 
[01:47:30]  And then he goes in to get the room and comes out and says they're sold out for the night.  Well, you're a nice guy.  You'd be a good boyfriend.  You're a good friend.  I love that story.  I would never do that next week at the Commerce Cafe.  I would never do that.  Wow.  Wow.  Nice, shameless plug.  Nice.  I just want to throw it in next week, Wednesday through Monday.  You're on in Rochester?  Yeah, we're on in Rochester.  And this plug was just heard at, I think, one in the morning.  Yeah.  Oh, they're on at night, aren't they? 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, why put you on live time?  Why put you on live?  That would be stupid.  Get ratings and stuff.  Yeah.  Do you go on there after the XFL reruns or?  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go to Patrick.  Patrick, what's up?  They're all sold out, but can you tell the desk clerk there everything's fine and you're  fine?  Go ahead, Patrick.  We lost Patrick.  All right.  Why don't we take a quick break and we'll give Rich Voss a little surprise.  Yeah.  I think the listener should guess how Rich Voss made history. 
[01:48:30]  Okay.  That could be a little fun.  Rich Voss made history.  Yeah.  Guess it will give you a prize.  Right.  More games on the Opie and Anthony show.  Here's another one for you.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Because I'll say what the **** I want to say.  No one else can get away with the ****.  I'll get away with it.  Nobody in the **** world can get away with the ****.  I'll get away with it.  Wait a minute, Rick.  Now you're going to bleed me.  You hill-mannered sack of crap.  The Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:49:00]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  I think we lost Norton for the rest of the day.  He's mad at someone.  All I heard was someone opened the door to go out and I heard a crashing, smashing sound.  I don't know what was thrown across the room.  Jim Norton, are you okay?  I can't tell you how I hate when something is supposed to be done and it's not done right. 
[01:49:30]  Verizon, if you have a choice of long distance, don't go with them.  They stink.  What happened?  Because I'm moving to New York.  I have a phone that's supposed to be hooked up.  So what they do is they accept your appointment.  Of course they accept your appointment.  And then the day they're supposed to be there, they check and go,  Oh, we've got line problems.  We've got to do all that.  And then it's going to take another week.  And they tell me, well, it won't take a week.  And they call me again today and they push my order back.  They are the absolute worst.  They stink.  You're not doing me a favor by putting... 
[01:50:00]  Wow.  Dude, I can't tell you how aggravated that makes me.  You are...  Verizon is horrible.  You stink.  Why did I never have this problem with another phone company?  Ever.  They don't check it the day they accept your order.  The day they agree to take your money, they don't check anything.  It's the day they're supposed to be there.  When were you supposed to get your phone?  Well, the day I called originally was well over a week ago.  And now you're going to get it a week from now? 
[01:50:30]  And then they said they'd push it back to the 28th.  I'm human.  There's nothing I can do.  You know, because you really don't need a phone in 2002 to answer emails, to make calls.  You know, it's all through basically the mail.  We all mail things to each other.  That's how things are done.  And we know how you love your computer.  Scumbags.  They are absolutely...  And that's what bothers me.  Not that they have a line problem.  Get Roadrunner.  Well, it's the same.  It's big business.  You can't get them on the phone.  Dell.  Oh, I got them on the phone.  As far as the email and all that, get the Roadrunner.  Well, the cable... 
[01:51:00]  Yeah, you're right.  I do have to do that.  But the cable thing, I haven't even ordered yet.  But they are the absolute worst.  See, you know what?  You've got to have...  Horrible.  All right, Jim.  But it's not about you today.  I know it's not.  You've really got to have, like, Oprah or Anthony call for you.  Really.  You don't have enough juice yet.  I went up to his apartment, and it's really nice, though.  Dude, I wanted...  He's got a nice place.  I wanted to bite somebody's effing face for that.  I hate the coppers.  Overlooking edelweiss.  It's nice.  All right.  It overlooks a transvestite club.  Oh, they suck!  He has a couch and binoculars there. 
[01:51:30]  Hello, Norton.  This is James Earl Jones from Horizon.  Exactly.  How is your phone coming?  It stinks, and I know you stutter in real life, unless you're reading script.  You liar!  You are under my command.  We will put your phone in when we want.  The Force cannot help you now.  Your phone line, Norton?  Leave that to me. 
[01:52:00]  The pissed off is strong in this one.  They just don't care how much their incompetence effs up your life.  It means nothing.  Everyone cannot help you now.  Oh.  I'm bad.  All right.  Well, Rich Voss is here, Anthony.  We've got a surprise for him.  He made history.  Yes, he did.  Rich Voss made history, Anthony.  I've got a phone on time.  The worst.  And we're going to have the listeners guess how Rich Voss made history. 
[01:52:30]  If you get it right, we're going to give you something, and then we're going to do a little something with Rich, okay?  It will affect Norton for our words.  You know what?  The last hour of the show is going to be great.  I really hate that.  Yeah.  Chris.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Rich Voss in the studio.  How did he make history?  He made history by financing the world's oldest Mercedes.  How's the Benzo running?  What's happening?  Oh, he got you.  I got you.  How's the Benzo running? 
[01:53:00]  I think it's nice, man.  I cleaned it.  It's really running.  Yeah.  What year is that?  What year is it?  It has the emblem.  That's all that matters.  But what year is that thing?  Like a 92.  Look at Obie.  Look, you've been in it.  It's not a 92.  It's a 92.  Is it a 92?  It's a 92, and I'm a good driver.  It's a 92.  That was the one year they brought back the crank start.  Joe.  Yeah.  You have a guess?  We're trying to figure out how Rich Voss made history. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah.  One of the only comedians to go 20 consecutive shows without a laugh.  Oh, stop it.  It was 22.  The guy is very funny.  He really is funny.  This is a character.  It's a character.  Let's go to Mike.  Mike.  Hey, Mike.  Yeah.  Mike.  You have an answer for us?  Yeah, I think...  Mike.  I think you have the longest career as a dryer door salesman.  The longest career as a dryer door salesman.  You've been held for ransom somewhere? 
[01:54:00]  I've been saddening his daughter since before she's been alive.  Exactly.  You must...  All right.  Jonah from Philly wants to defend Rich Voss.  Jonah.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey, bro.  What's happening?  Hey, I just want to say, Norton, you rule.  Thank you, sir.  Seriously, so much that I make my girlfriend scream your name during sex.  Really?  Wow, that rocks.  Hell, yeah.  Hey, Voss.  What's up?  I just want to say one thing to you.  You know, you should start doing your comedy show naked so at least the audience has something 
[01:54:30]  to laugh at.  Dude, you should have been an abortion.  Your doctor's name should have been Rusty Coat Hanger.  They hang up.  I didn't even defend myself.  They hang up.  Why?  He tricked us, though.  It said that you were really funny.  Tony, what's going on?  Yeah, I just wanted to say something to Voss.  Yeah, what's that?  It's kind of interesting to me that your sex life and your comedy actor are very much in  the same, being that you're the only one who enjoys them.  Oh, oh, oh.  Norton, you rule, man.  That's what I do.  These guys are... 
[01:55:00]  I like that one.  That was a good one.  I can't wait to use it to me.  Hey, Norton.  These goddamn callers really make me laugh.  That was a good one.  Hey, Norton.  It's never going to work, sir.  I'm too good.  I'm too good.  I was going to tell you that I'm coming up to Cleveland.  After I saw you on the Colin Quinn show, I laughed my effing balls off.  Oh, very cool.  Thank you, buddy.  And I've never said this before, but...  Oh, maybe?  No.  No, he didn't get you.  He just hung up.  Horizon stinks. 
[01:55:30]  Stinks.  Stinks.  All right.  Dwayne, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I figured it out.  I know exactly what Voss did.  Yeah.  He was the first person to ever eat an apple through a picket fence.  Oh, God.  What's that mean?  Eat an apple through a picket fence?  Look at the teeth on him.  Oh, boy.  Teeth jokes now.  I'm sorry, Rich.  Now we're going to have a bunch of teeth.  Dan from Hoboken wants to know if it's true that Voss is driving around in Hitler's Mercedes  Benz.  Was it actually owned and driven by Adolf Hitler himself? 
[01:56:00]  How is that self...  Any self-respecting Jew...  No, you're wrong.  Because, first of all, I would never buy a new one and send money back to the German economy.  This was used, so the money didn't go back there.  Okay?  Is that how you justify it?  I have morals.  I don't wear Adidas because they took too money to finance their company.  I heard.  I don't know if that's exactly true.  So you're hurting somebody's business based on some rumor.  Yeah.  I don't know.  It sounded good.  All right.  Nike salesman told me that it sounded good. 
[01:56:30]  Why don't you not read Gene Wilder films because he did Springtime for Hitler, you jackass.  Shut up.  I got a phone.  All right.  Larry, I'll give you some feedback.  You're like, it sucks from Jersey.  Voss would make history if he paid his bill at the paint store.  Oh.  Hey, what's that all about?  What's that about, bro?  There's some guy from the paint store that you owe money to?  That you're dodging?  I'm dodging.  When I had my paint business...  Oh, yeah.  I owed a lot of money.  Well, back then is when I was getting, you know, partying and getting high and stuff. 
[01:57:00]  And, you know, I used to get a lot of...  I had a lot of credit.  I had a big paint business.  Like, during the winter, I would get everybody's money as a deposit.  You know, for the summer.  You know, to do their houses.  And I'd spend it all.  You know, and I told them I was going to use Benjamin Moore.  But I had those cans.  And I'd put, like, Woolworth's paint in it and stuff.  Because I spent the money on blow.  Oh, God.  We are...  Oh, my God.  That's great.  And all of a sudden, the paint store wants their money.  They all want their money.  Yeah, they all want their money.  Hey, you know what? 
[01:57:30]  I took care of that when I did bankruptcy.  Now, leave me alone.  You're not getting your money.  All right?  I hope your house is peeling.  All right?  Probably it.  Listen, I can get into it.  I'll send you a CD.  Now, leave me alone.  This is a fine satin coat of Benjamin Moore paint.  I had the cans, though.  All right?  You should have listened to...  You had Benjamin Moore cans.  The cans, but I poured Woolworth's paint in it.  And you poured the cheap paint in it and it went to go over the house.  Okay.  You should have listened to your friends who got aluminum siding.  All right?  Stupid.  Wow.  We painted this funeral home every year. 
[01:58:00]  We painted this one funeral home every year.  This is true.  And there was an awning, an awning about, you know, 30 feet long.  Yeah.  They said, whatever you do, do not get paint on this awning.  Right?  Whatever.  Right?  I mean, it was right into the funeral home, the awning.  The people don't get...  So we put drop cloths all over it, right?  And we dropped a plank through it.  We didn't get any paint on it.  All you heard was the plank go right through the awning.  Right?  I would go to work.  I had my own business.  And I would go to work.  I would sit up to guys.  And then I would, like...  Because I was all blacked out. 
[01:58:30]  And then I'd go to the park and lay in the sun.  And I'd come back lunchtime, see how things were going.  But the business failed.  I owed paint stores.  I owed lumber yards.  All right?  That's why it's a 92 Mercedes, not a 99.  All right, Doug.  What's going on?  Doug.  Yeah, hey.  I heard Boston's CD finally won aluminum foil.  Is that true?  Go aluminum foil.  How many copies do you have to sell for it to go aluminum foil?  Five?  I think it's like three.  Three, and it goes aluminum foil.  The CD's great.  And I think he bought two of those himself. 
[01:59:00]  There you go.  Thank you.  We're trying to figure out how Rich Voss made history.  Big Al.  What's up, guys?  Hey, Mazel Tov, Voss.  Happy Passover.  Thank you.  Hey, Voss, aside from being the only man with a picture of Norris on his website,  was the first white comic on Death Comedy Jam.  Oh, yes.  Is that it?  That is it.  That is it.  I was the Holly Berry of comedy.  The Holly Berry of comedy. 
[01:59:30]  Holly Berry.  Holly Berry.  Holly Berry.  Holly Berry.  Who cares?  She's not banging me.  Let me tell you something.  Does she pray to Allah?  I, uh...  That was only one of my history-making moments in my career.  Yeah.  I can give you a couple more, but yes, I was, you know...  And we...  And, Voss, we have the tape.  We have the tape.  We watched it in the office.  Happy tape.  We're going to play it for everyone right here.  Happy tape.  We watched it in the office.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Big Al. 
[02:00:00]  You win, all right?  Thanks, guys.  I don't know.  We got some cool stuff.  We got tickets to see Dice.  We got tickets to see Jim Norton.  We got tickets to see the Chemical Brothers.  So, you just tell Stinky what you want, all right?  Will do.  You got PlayStation 2?  No, I don't, actually.  Well, we don't have the...  Sorry, I shouldn't have said it like that.  We have a game for PlayStation 2.  Yeah, Norton rules.  Thank you, sir.  Hold on, Big Al, all right?  Thank you, sir.  Do you have a brand-new Mercedes-Benz?  Well, you're not going to get one, either.  How do you have a tape of this?  Oh. 
[02:00:30]  Rick, I'll get up.  Actually, one of our listeners.  We watched it in the office and were stunned by your performance in front of their all-black crowd.  Where was that done?  There was one white person in the audience and you on the stage.  Yeah, but see, now the tape you have, right?  I did eight minutes, and they edited it down to, like, four minutes.  He was at the taping.  You were there when I taped it.  Me and Eric McMahon were the other two white guys in the balcony.  Oh, really?  In the balcony, because times have changed.  I mean, I'm sitting in the back. 
[02:01:00]  And it's funny, when you do Dev Jam, like, the guy comes out in the beginning and says,  look, you cannot boo the comics.  You know, this is not like the Apollo.  You cannot boo the comics.  Right.  And I was watching one of the tapings, and this black comic goes on, and he is bombing.  And when black people can't boo you, they'll sit there and go, mmm, mmm, mmm, and they just mmm him the whole set.  I think Guy Torrey was actually the warm-up guy.  Yeah, Guy Torrey was the warm-up guy.  Let me tell you, it was a lot of pressure.  I bet.  We could tell you were a little nervous, and you were playing to the black crowd. 
[02:01:30]  And you started, Rich, you started turning black.  Well, I had to.  As the act went on, your voice, your walk, you were just, here's this Jewish guy going, you know, yeah, I'm down with that.  Well, you're like, when you finally, the ultimate thing, when you finally just quit working and went to the unemployment office,  I said, now he's gone too far to try to fit in. 
[02:02:00]  Well, there you have it, Rich Foss, first white guy on the deaf comedy show.  Can I tell you about this real quick?  Yeah, we're going to stop.  Is it true you're listed as End More on the tape?  Oh, is he in his room?  Is he in his room?  Yeah.  You're not even on the box.  I haven't got paper yet.  No, he's End More.  I'm trying to get money.  Well, listen to me.  First of all, the show was on for five years, and it was the hottest show on HBO at the time.  I remember watching it.  I'd sit there and go, Jesus Christ.  All right.  White people are crazy. 
[02:02:30]  Anyhow, right?  Look at him.  With dead John.  I know.  I look crazy.  Anyhow, so five years of the number one show on HBO, right?  Right.  Okay.  And notice right after you were on, it went off the air.  No, another year after.  Shut up.  I got it from a Negro.  No, no.  My kids have more TV credits than you.  So, listen.  How do you know?  You're dodging.  I don't know.  Please, put your resume on a business card.  I, uh...  All right, boss.  Get to the point.  You just want to play this.  Five years of the number. 
[02:03:00]  So, they go, well, we're going to use a white guy.  And it was me, right?  Yeah.  Because I was doing all the black.  I started black comedy in Jersey.  I was big.  Big in Newark.  So, how did they pick you?  I mean, that seems to be quite an honor.  Listen, I got other big moments in my career.  Oh, my God.  They picked me, right?  Now, listen.  They taped 12 episodes or whatever.  That year, they had celebrity hosts.  Right?  Celebrity, all the, you know, whatever.  When you're telling these little stories, here's a good idea.  All right. 
[02:03:30]  Have a point.  It makes it so much more interesting for the listener.  Tomorrow, Norris will have an Arthur impression.  Now, listen to me.  Okay?  Excuse me.  So, now, all these...  Okay.  They taped 12 shows.  All the comics went down.  Age Bill.  Everybody, right?  They put me on the 12th show.  Mm-hmm.  Second from last.  Uh-oh.  What does that mean?  So, everybody that taped all week was there to watch to go to the after party after.  So, you had all these big comics, all these white people going, all white comics going, 
[02:04:00]  you better be funny because you're the first...  It was nerve-wracking.  Okay?  Mm-hmm.  You know.  Can we play the tape?  I'm just trying to stall.  I know if you are.  I'm trying to stall.  So, we'll stop it as we go.  Okay?  All right.  Here it is, the history-making moment.  Give us the year.  When was this?  I don't know.  It was like...  I know.  Play the intro, too.  We're going to play the intro.  All right.  The first white comic on Def Comedy Jam.  It's Rich Voss.  Check this out.  This brother right here has appeared on Showtime at the Apollo, and he is here tonight to make 
[02:04:30]  history.  You'll see what I mean.  Y'all, show your love for Rich Voss.  Come on, y'all.  Rich Voss on Def Jam.  Oh, my God.  The animators are flying in the air.  You're ready, too.  You're checking me out, huh?  A lot of sisters.  They already stopped.  A lot of sisters in the house checking me out.  This can take a half hour, man. 
[02:05:00]  It's a four-minute piece.  You sound black right off the bat.  Well, okay.  And you see what I was wearing?  It's all right, but you see what I was wearing?  Yeah.  You had the hooded sweatshirt.  They told me to wear it.  I had Fat Farm.  Oh, you didn't do the Fat Farm.  I still saved it.  All right.  I'm Big Dick Black.  Here we go.  Listen.  A lot of sisters in the house checking me out, huh?  All right.  Remember, once you go white, you go right back to black. 
[02:05:30]  I'm not like the brothers.  I'll eat the coochie, okay?  That's what I'm talking about.  What?  That's what I'm talking about.  You are the whitest black guy.  I've seen you a hundred times at Caroline's.  I've never heard you go.  That's what I'm talking about.  That's what I'm talking about.  I thought they were going to throw luggage at me.  Oh, God.  Jesus, my God.  You're the two.  Charcoal briquette.  A moulinion.  You never heard me talk. 
[02:06:00]  You, by the end of this, you're just going, yeah, let me tell you something.  Yeah, let me ask you all a question.  You turn into a black man.  You completely just, you throw away any Jewish heritage you have, and you are an African man.  It was after that taping, he stole 50 bucks from me.  Oh, God.  He leaves the stage taller than he did when he got out, because he's got those rings around  his neck and the plates in his lips, and a bone through his nose. 
[02:06:30]  You went way old school.  I was going to wear an alpaca and silk socks.  Lost first white comedian on death.  Yeah.  I said, my sister used to go out with a black guy.  I said, what's up with that?  She said, once you go black, you never go back.  I go, that's because our family won't let you in.  I said, what's up with that?  You hear that?  My sister went out with a black guy.  I said, what's up with that? 
[02:07:00]  What's up with that?  Yeah.  We actually have a clip of Rich Voss the day after this happened, trying to get a gig  at another club.  You don't want to hire any niggas, that's all.  Wow.  You don't want to hire any niggas, that's all.  Really?  Oh, we got to take him.  Caroline's doing the same exact act.  It'll be in the white version.  And he sounds like the white guy.  You know what I'm talking about? 
[02:07:30]  My sister, and I don't mean my sisters, like the lovely Ebony Princesses I have in the audience.  After they aired it, the next day, my sister called me and goes, what are you telling people  on TV I went out with a black guy?  That's my problem.  Dave, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, boys?  Hey.  I was just wondering, I'm on hold, I'm hearing the crowd laughing, is it D-E-A-F comedy jam?  Oh, God.  Wow.  And Norton. 
[02:08:00]  Don't even think about it, it's the best ever.  You suck.  All right, here's that line again.  My sister used to go out with a black guy.  I said, what's up with that?  She said, once you go black, you never go back.  I go, that's because our family won't let you in.  Loosen up.  Can't we all get along?  Oh, you broke that out.  Oh, no. 
[02:08:30]  The Rodney King book.  That was back around the Rodney King book.  It was topical.  It was topical.  I mean, it wasn't Polish humor, but it was back then.  Oh, oh.  Help me.  Help me.  Help me.  Somebody help me.  Help me.  Help me.  I did do a Polish joke, but at least I didn't say it in a Polish accent, stupid.  Oh, God.  Oh, this is too funny.  We're only a minute in.  Oh, here we go. 
[02:09:00]  Until I get in my car and get the f*** out of here.  Yeah.  But we got the white girl over there going, oh, he's going to start.  White people, we need to riot tonight.  Me and you, baby.  I'm kidding, though.  I'm kidding.  White people don't know how to riot.  We'd steal lumber.  Honey, look at all this plywood I got. 
[02:09:30]  Honey, look at all this here plywood I got.  Honey, why, let me tell you about the plywood I just stole.  This is the funniest thing.  Lord have mercy.  It's Tyrone Voss.  Let's give it up for him.  He was a white guy doing an impression of a white guy there.  Frank from Folksburg, New York, writes,  Voss, notorious J-E-W. 
[02:10:00]  Oh, God damn.  My new name's Rasheem Ramalala-Lukwam.  We're a minute 30 in.  Okay, all right.  We got two and a half minutes to go, I think.  I love working a black audience.  I'm telling you, man.  White audiences are cool.  You know, it's money, it's money.  The black audiences give it up.  You know.  But whenever I leave a black club,  I go to my car, there's like 2,000 flyers on my car. 
[02:10:30]  Black people will promote anything.  Rasheem's graduating.  Flyer.  He's killing.  Order recue at Gerald Kelly's.  Flyer.  I'm telling you, man.  It's falling out of the trees.  I just want to say, I love carrying the message.  I just celebrated 10 years without a drug or a drink in my body.  Sober by the grace of God.  Thank you.  10 years clean.  It works if you work it. 
[02:11:00]  And I don't need to get high now,  because I've got gambling to fall back on.  You hear him, though?  He sounds like a thing.  The numbers, the lotteries.  Who plays the numbers here?  Don't lie.  Don't lie.  Don't lie.  Who plays the numbers here?  Don't lie.  Don't front.  You'll be frontin'.  You'll frontin'.  Money's money.  Money's money.  You're back to the clip.  Hey, where are the white women at?  I said money's money.  Money's money.  Money.  I got benefits. 
[02:11:30]  Take it easy.  Ken Howard.  Ken Howard.  That's right.  The white shadow.  Nice.  All right.  How funny is that, Ray?  Here it is again.  Them numbers, the lotteries.  Who plays the numbers here?  Don't lie.  There you go.  Black people play the numbers the best.  The best.  Two brothers will be sitting on the front porch at our house.  One runs off, gets hit by a car.  The only one's going, what was that license plate number?  I'm playing it. 
[02:12:00]  So, Kabooby got shot six times.  Kabooby.  Kabooby.  What the hell is that Kabooby?  There was a guy when I went to high school named Kabooby, and he was treacherous.  He used to just, he'd walk by.  He'd walk by you and hold his hand out.  And he wouldn't say anything.  You just gave him your money.  He was like Oz back in high school.  Kabooby.  And I'd go, here comes Kabooby.  And you would just give up some of your stuff.  He was a thug of thugs. 
[02:12:30]  Wow.  Where is he now, Rich?  Huh?  What happened to him, man?  I know.  What's up with him?  I think he works for Verizon.  Back in the day.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, I want to see this tape.  I want to see Voss move his head back and forth like Oprah when she be black.  When Voss said this, though, the place came apart.  There is no racial bigotry here.  I do not look down on niggers, kites, wops, or greasers.  Yeah, I didn't get quite the laugh. 
[02:13:00]  Don't worry, Voss.  A little over a minute to go.  So, Kabooby got shot six times on 4th Street at 2 o'clock.  6-4-2.  Wheel the mother.  There is nothing worse than when you go to play the numbers that have someone work in a lottery machine that don't speak English.  Right?  I went today.  I said to the guy, I said, 6-2-8.  He went, 6-3-8?  No stupid 6-2-8, but play 6-3-8 in case it comes out now, okay? 
[02:13:30]  They love me.  They love me.  Those are my people.  All right, one more thing, man.  Is this your girl right here?  Right here.  Is this your girl right here?  Is that your baby?  Yeah, baby.  Yeah, hi, I'm Rich Voss, my lady, love.  Sweet dessert.  Voss is a giant turkey. 
[02:14:00]  Right here.  All right, one more thing, man.  Is this your girl right here?  Right here.  Your friend.  All right.  Who's married here?  Anybody married in the house?  Yeah.  In the house?  Oh.  Anyone married in the house?  You sound like that old WB announcer is like, and catch the next episode of In the House.  It's funky fresh.  Oh.  In the house?  What am I supposed to say?  Anybody here married in the auditorium? 
[02:14:30]  It's a house.  Don't walk.  That's the closest you're going to get to a real house, so you say, in the house.  Oh, God.  All right, here's the joke.  Your friend.  All right.  Who's married here?  Anybody married in the house?  All right.  You two married?  Don't lie.  I saw that movie, In Decent Proposal, the other night.  You see that?  Guy offered another guy a million dollars to sleep with his wife.  Would you do that for a million dollars?  You'd do it for a Big Mac, you big mother.  Let me tell you, when I was married, someone gives me a million dollars for my wife, a million 
[02:15:00]  dollars.  Let me tell you, I push his ass as he's a little harder.  That's it.  I grab his ass.  That's it.  Good night.  Thank you.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let the F-bomb fly. 
[02:15:30]  I got a parched standing ovation there.  All right, wait.  Here's the rest of it.  Y'all show your love right there one more time.  Rich Voss in the house.  Yeah.  Well, you saw it.  You was here.  History was made.  Is this still Voss?  First white dude on Def Jam. 
[02:16:00]  Now, we even.  Now, we even.  I, that's what I'm talking about.  That was a standing ovation, and they were standing erect, too.  Oh, I'm talking.  Oh, was that it?  How did you turn on them?  They were so good to hear.  I know.  It was great.  Let me tell you.  Let me tell you.  Oh, God.  You stink.  Hey, first of all.  Actually, somebody asked for a copy of a tape of Voss. 
[02:16:30]  I know my brother.  You've got to buy your own.  Hey, Kabooby's checking in.  Kabooby.  Kabooby.  Hey, Kabooby.  Hey, how are you doing?  What's up, Kabooby?  What's up in the house, fellas?  Man, this guy be keeping it real.  He's keeping it real.  Yeah.  All right, Kabooby.  Come out.  Kabooby.  I mean, I had some good lines about Angela Davis.  Oh, you did?  They cut that out? 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, they cut that out.  It was a lady in the audience with a big afro.  Yeah.  A big celebrity, Angela Davis.  What else about black people always say, Whitey's taking our jobs.  Whitey's holding us down.  I don't know who this guy Whitey is, but we've got to catch him.  I don't know.  How did that go?  They came apart at the seams for that one?  Well, let me tell you something.  Busting up on Whitey, are you, Voss?  Listen, let me tell you something.  Down with the man.  Let me tell you something about you crackers.  Listen to me.  All right? 
[02:17:30]  Us crackers.  All right.  You were down with it in the house.  You know what?  We were talking about acting ability.  Yeah.  What, am I going to go in there and talk like a redneck?  No.  Just be yourself, stupid.  I know what I was talking about.  A long time ago.  Yeah.  All right, we've got to move on.  We've got to move on.  All right.  That was really, really good.  Anthony, we have a big surprise outside the studio.  Do we?  We've been trying to get him on the show for close to a year.  Yeah.  He was stopped at an airport because he wouldn't take his shoes off, remember?  Really? 
[02:18:00]  He has the Curly Frye shoes.  Yellowly Frye.  We have the Iron Sheik outside the studio.  Oh.  And then we have the fake Iron Sheik call in.  Remember all that crap?  Yeah, he was full of it.  So we're going to meet the Iron Sheik next.  All right.  And, boss, where are you playing?  Next Wednesday through Sunday at Rochester, in Rochester at the Comics Cafe.  All right.  And this Saturday at the Madison Square Garden Room.  Very good.  Where are you April 18th?  I don't know.  Town Hall with Jim Norton, maybe?  No, I'm in North Carolina.  Okay.  No, next week, Comics Cafe. 
[02:18:30]  All kidding aside, you guys got to go check out Rich Voss.  Oh, yeah.  Hilarious.  Very funny.  So funny.  We ride him hard, but he's hilarious.  I thought when I heard you had a surprise, you were going to out me or something.  I thought I was a new parento.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  I did a lot of things.  You just went old school for Boston.  I know.  All right.  Listen, we've got to take a break in Iron Sheik next.  Right.  Don't touch that dial, American.  Team boot.  See the U.S.A.  It's your chest roll. 
[02:19:00]  Say celebration of freedom.  That's why it's freedom of speech.  It's not freedom to say things that you accept stuff that might offend people.  It's freedom to say horrible things.  Sometimes it's clever and funny, and other times it's downright disgusting and offensive.  O.B. and Anthony.  Making the First Amendment seem like a bad idea.  We're on virus, virus, virus.  Yeah, we're back. 
[02:19:30]  It's the O.B. and Anthony show.  Oh, I...  We got some tape to play.  Oh, yeah.  Hopefully do it before the end of the show.  Rich Voss in the Hay House.  In the Hay House.  Hay House.  I'm trying to say.  Jim Norton in the Hay House.  You know what's not in the house?  A phone line that works, Verizon.  You suck.  Some cute girl was on the line from Verizon.  She was going to help you out.  Uh-oh.  All right.  Well, we went along with the Rich Voss segment. 
[02:20:00]  He hung up, so maybe she could call back.  No, that's not Boston.  It's called Boston.  It's probably a phone line.  All right.  It's not about you, Jim, because the legend is walking into the studio.  The legend.  Not that legend.  Another legend.  Ah, there he is.  Hey, what's up?  The man, everybody.  I love to hate.  It's the Iron Sheik.  Back in the old days.  The Iron Sheik.  The Iron Sheik.  There he is.  Look at you.  You look just like you did back in the old days.  Thank you, sir.  Are you Anthony or Opio? 
[02:20:30]  I am Anthony.  Anthony.  That is Opio.  Opio.  First of all, pleasure for me to you guys bring me from Olympic City, Atlanta, Georgia.  The Big Apple, the most famous city in the world.  That's why I come three times, champion of the World Wrestling Federation.  The most famous arena in the world, Manhattan, Madison, Surrogarden.  All right.  I want to say hello to all my wrestling fans, to the lesson, to the WNEW number one station 
[02:21:00]  in America.  And pleasure to talk to Opio and Anthony.  Very good.  Thank you.  So much.  Wait, what?  Iron Sheik.  Thank you, sir.  And what the hell are you doing with yourself these days?  Well, I'm here.  My agent, Steve Chaplin, called me from Georgia and bring me to Big Apple.  We have a couple autographed sections.  Oh.  You want to talk?  Friday and Saturday.  Come call me.  Get on mic there.  Come here.  The guy that speaks English.  Over there.  Right.  Or, yeah, over there. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah, Friday and Saturday will be the comic book convention at the St. Ignatius Church.  Why don't you talk into the mic, sir?  59th and 9th Street in Manhattan.  59th and 9th.  Right.  And you'll be signing autographs.  St. Ignatius Church.  When is it?  Friday afternoon and Saturday all day.  Friday afternoon and Saturday all day.  Just in case they didn't hear it.  All right.  Very good.  Thank you.  Wow.  So, back in the day, I mean, everyone, you were a pretty bad guy.  Well, you know.  People didn't like you.  It was during.  I know what you mean.  I didn't involve with the politician or Ayatollah Khomeini, but I grew up with all my life with the toughest sport in the world. 
[02:22:00]  Freestyle and Greco-Roman.  So, I come wrestling with the Mr. McMahon World Wrestling Federation.  Right.  And I come three times WWF champion besides Olympic, besides AAU, besides World Games.  I remember all the great matches against you and Sergeant Slaughter.  Yes.  Had a lot of good ones during the Gulf War time period.  Very big.  Very big.  I remember that. 
[02:22:30]  Especially that camp would match.  Yes, sir.  Yes.  Yes.  And then you came out.  You'd wave the flag and everyone would throw stuff at you.  Well, you know, because I was a rare, Anthony, Parisian man, all this country in the world.  But I'll be honest with you.  I didn't grow up with the politician.  No.  I grew up with the sport, toughest sport in the Olympic, freestyle and Greco-Roman.  So, you never wanted to get rid of America or anything for real, right?  Not really.  Because, you know, I know I born in all this country in the world, Tehran, Iran. 
[02:23:00]  But I made it in America, greatest country in the earth, especially the most famous arena in the world, Madison Square Garden.  Madison Square Garden.  Yes.  He mentions the Garden more than Dice does.  Right.  I have a lot of friends.  I want to say hello to all my wrestling friends in the Big Apple.  Yes.  And also Iranian people.  And I love to you, people, listen to the WNEW number one station in America. 
[02:23:30]  You didn't just give all the cab drivers a code word to run people over, did you?  No.  NEW is not even the number one station on 57th.  This station sucks.  What country are you from?  I'm originally from the oldest country in the world, Iran.  Iran.  Iran.  Tehran.  Tehran.  Really?  Tell us a little bit about that.  I love Iran.  Iran.  How old were you when you left Iran?  My last Olympic, I competed in 1968, Mexico City. 
[02:24:00]  I was a coach for University of Minnesota, 1969 and 1970, and I went to Olympic Munich, Germany.  And after Munich, Germany, 72, I turned professional, and then I made it in Big Apple.  So you left...  Wait, wait, wait.  You made it in the Big Apple.  Where did you make it in the Big Apple?  Well, Mr. McMahon, senior, God bless you so, he passed away, and then they found out...  Arsenio died? 
[02:24:30]  What just did I hear?  No, it was career.  No, that was his father, Mr. McMahon, senior.  No, but you made it...  Oh, senior.  Okay.  Not junior.  And he made it in the Big Apple.  Where did you make it in the Big Apple there?  Well, I made it in the Big Apple, too.  I come for wrestling in the most famous arena in the world, Madison.  Oh, that's right.  All right.  That's right.  Yes, sir.  You have big matches there, huh?  Yes, sir.  In the bell.  I come single champion, and Nicola and I become tag team champion.  Yes.  And also by the world, three times.  Really?  Three times?  Yes, sir. 
[02:25:00]  And you'd come out, and you'd wear what was thought to us as traditional Iranian garb.  You'd have the curly shoes on.  Absolutely.  I remember that.  And you'd wave the flag, and people would yell and scream horrible things at you.  And Sergeant Slaughter would come in and start beating you up, and everyone would cheer.  Not really, Ivan.  You're right.  Maybe he can beat me once a while, but most of the time, I was a winner, especially I beat that Hollywood blonde, Jabroni Hogan, and Madison Square Garden in New York. 
[02:25:30]  And six years, nobody with Mr. Bob Backland, also I beat him in the garden.  A barbecue?  Yes, sir, Mr. Bob Backland.  Bob Backland.  Backland.  But the people, you're right, Anthony, or of you, because people didn't like me because I used to cheer Ayatollah Khomeini flag.  Right.  And I was a real country, man.  Well, you know what?  And his famous line was, Iran is the best, and then he would spit.  Right.  I used to say, yeah, Russia, number one.  Iran, number one. 
[02:26:00]  Right.  USA, ah, tough.  But no, I don't say anymore.  No, you better not.  No, I say, no, I say.  It's not really the climate to say that now, right?  Right.  Have you noticed maybe that act wouldn't play too well these days, right?  Not really, because, you know, like I said, I born of a country, but I made it in America.  Greatest wrestling country, greatest country on earth.  You ever do a deaf jam audience?  You ever do deaf jam?  Never do deaf comedy jam.  Shut up, boss.  No, I'm not into the comedy.  Not into the comedy.  My partner is on the comedy. 
[02:26:30]  Because I heard somebody had called us up and said that the Iron Sheik was doing stand-up comedy.  No, sir, somebody else used my name.  He uses your name.  Right, and then they did that.  But I'm the only one from all this country in the world.  Tehran, Iran.  Tehran, Iran.  And then you came here to the U.S., and you were at, what was that big place that you wrestled at?  Madison Square Garden, New York.  Madison Square Garden, number one.  Number one arena, the most famous arena in the world.  Of course.  Madison Square Garden, New York, number one. 
[02:27:00]  Now, also, I want to know about, who's the Russian guy?  Nikolai Volkov.  Nikolai Volkov.  Remember that?  They would come out, and it was all, we hated you.  And I heard you had some problems at an airport.  Is that true?  Well, I've been to the airport in Georgia usually since September 11.  And at that time, the Middle East, maybe I'm involved with the tourists, but I'm not really.  I grew up with the toughest sport in the world, wrestling. 
[02:27:30]  But they checked me, and they take my tennis shoes off.  They take my socks off.  They check me around.  And then they found out I'm Iron Sheik.  I gave them a couple pictures.  Everybody was happy.  Oh, is that it?  Yes, sir.  So they found out you were the Iron Sheik, and no problems with your shoes.  No problem.  You weren't wearing them curly shoes, though.  Yes, sir.  That's an alteration in all countries we used to wear it, walk top of the side.  But you don't walk through an airport security with the curly shoes on.  Well, you know, I mean, that was it.  If you want to get on the plane quickly, I'd recommend not wearing the curly shoes. 
[02:28:00]  Leave them at home.  Yes, sir.  Not anymore, because, you know, that was a custom of them.  I mean, it is custom, but from since that, you're right, Anthony, I don't wear it anymore.  Right.  What's with the curly shoe?  Well, that's an alteration in all countries.  The oldest country.  Right.  All this Tehran, Iran.  And we walked off the sand.  We don't get burned.  Our feet doesn't get burned.  But sometimes...  To walk through the sand?  Right.  But sometimes I have a lot of camel.  I do with it.  We call car one.  And then I kill all the camel all night. 
[02:28:30]  The camel?  Yeah, the camel.  I hear you.  Yes.  Whatever happened to Bob Backlund and Sergeant Slaughter?  Well, Bob Backlund...  Sergeant Slaughter is still with the WWF.  Sergeant Slaughter is one of the agents and still is an employee for the WWF.  And Mr. Bob Backlund, six years, nobody beat him.  He's with the radio check over at the Q here in New York.  Greatest city in the world.  Wow.  Yes, sir.  Now, I want to know where he defeated Hulk Hogan. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, you did have a big match with Hulk Hogan.  That was, as a matter of fact, Madison Square Garden.  It was.  It was Madison Square Garden.  I remember that, like it was yesterday.  What do you think about Hulk Hogan being back with the WWF?  Oh, good question.  Thank you, Opie.  Mr. McMahon is a genius.  Yes.  He's a smart number one promoter in the world.  He knows if some talent, like Hulk Hogan or someone other, they can bring the people, put 
[02:29:30]  on the seat for his company.  Right.  And always, he hired again.  And age doesn't matter.  And as long as they know, the talent, there are money for his company.  Exactly.  And he's the best promoter.  Well, that's why I bring him back.  That's what I'm getting to now.  Any chance of maybe seeing the Iron Sheik back with the WWF?  I'm on the road, Anthony.  37 years old.  I prefer to be...  You're 37 years old?  37 years old.  I'm on the road.  Oh, you're on the road.  I was going to say.  That's what he said, too.  You know, you're kind of skirting your age a little. 
[02:30:00]  You might want to pump it up a little bit.  37 to the third power.  You know, pump it up a little higher.  I prefer to share my experience for freestyle Greco-Roman.  And professional to all young...  Greco-Roman.  I like how he says that.  Right.  Greco-Roman.  Freestyle Greco-Roman.  Toughest sport in the world.  One-on-one.  It's not Michael Jordan's sport or not football.  It's an individual.  One-on-one.  And that's two men.  Now they get in a ring. 
[02:30:30]  And what do they got to do?  A Greco-Roman.  Well, that's not a Greco-Roman.  That's a professional.  Like Vince McVinney said, we are determined.  Right.  So that's the real, like, wrestling where you got to do the holds and pin and...  Exactly.  I heard that started out, the men were nude doing this back in the olden days in what,  Greece?  Well, that was the thousand, maybe a thousand, thousand years ago.  That was a Greek.  That was the first Olympic, as a matter of fact, was a Greek.  Those Greeks, they want to be naked with each other, the men, right? 
[02:31:00]  That's their business, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We call that prison.  Nothing like that happens in Tehran, Iran.  Not really, no.  Because Tehran, Iran, they are serious people, Islamic people.  They seem like serious.  And then we have a lot of great wrestlers like Takti, Habibi, Zandi, and we never go in  the mat being nude.  Are you famous in Iran?  Ahmed Shah of Iran, his wife, Muhammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, his wife, Farah Pahlavi. 
[02:31:30]  I was three years bodyguard.  Oh, you were the bodyguard.  Yes, the Shah, you were the bodyguard?  With the Shah of Iran.  You couldn't guard against that cancer, though, could you?  Well, you know, the reason I had that job and worked at the National Iranian Television  because I was an Iranian, Greco-Roman, and freestyle wrestler.  Greco-Roman.  Right.  Right.  And they gave me that job.  Boy, good thing you got when the getting was good.  I don't think when the Ayatollah got into power, I don't think the bodyguards of the Shah  were popular guys, you know what I mean?  Not that time, right.  No, no. 
[02:32:00]  You've got to get your curly shoes and run your ass off out of that country.  Absolutely.  Yes, sir, because...  You have Greco-Roman, they have guns.  Exactly.  You know what I mean?  Since Ayatollah took over, he was a position of the Secret Service, Savak, Rural Army, Navy,  and that was different timing.  But I was your country before that revolution.  Yeah, well, good thing.  Glad to have you.  You gave us a lot of entertainment over the years.  What did you think of today's wrestling there?  Today's wrestling is still the number one sport in your country, America, or in the world, 
[02:32:30]  because one of the top shows in your country, television, is the World Wrestling Federation,  and people watch wrestling more than football or any other sport.  And I remember I rest in Nicola and I, Pontiac, Michigan, 93,000 people can't watch that much.  Nobody sold out Pontiac, Michigan.  Pontiac, Michigan.  Yeah, Pontiac, Michigan.  Exact World Wrestling Federation.  That was a big arena there at the... 
[02:33:00]  Absolutely.  What is that called?  Yes, sir.  Yes, Anthony.  Yes, sir.  The place of Pontiac, uh...  Yes, sir.  Yeah.  So, anyway, I want to say again...  What's the one in New York?  Does that hold more people or less than Pontiac?  Oh, well, Madison, Sir Gardner...  That one.  25,000.  25,000.  So, more in Pontiac, Michigan.  I hear you.  Do you have a television set?  Do you have a TV?  In all countries, no, but I have a TV in Georgia.  See, Norton?  He's got a TV.  Get a goddamn television.  I need a TV, sir.  Wrong with you.  The guy doesn't have a television set. 
[02:33:30]  Do you have a phone network?  Do you have a telephone?  The phone thing I don't have.  My eyes are on the phone.  He stinks.  I'm sorry, sir.  My agents, the chief captain, have a cell phone and telephone.  All right.  Again, I want to say thank you for 1027-WNEW, number one station in America.  Pleasure to talk to you guys.  If NEW, this station here in New York, was a wrestler, it would be on the mat, pinned for the count.  Right.  Done.  All right.  This show is very good.  We have fun here.  Well, let's get Mr. Agent Guy to give the plug again. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah, give the plug up one more time.  Right on the mic, man.  We have a lot of people that listen to us here.  No, no, no.  On the mic.  On the mic.  There you go.  www.stupid.com slash Iron Sheik.  You can reach the Iron Sheik on the internet.  It's going to be at the Big Apple Comic Convention on Friday and Saturday at St. Ignatius Church,  59th Street and 9th Avenue in Manhattan.  All right.  Great.  Iron Sheik.  I want to say again hello to all my wrestling friends in New York and especially all American, 
[02:34:30]  Perigian, Middle Eastern, wherever.  God bless you, everybody.  Pleasure to come back again one more time to talk to Anthony and Opion.  Right.  God bless you guys.  Anthony and Opion.  Thank you, Iron Sheik.  What about Madison Square Garden?  Madison Square Garden, the Muslim Serena in the world, and number one.  Ya Allah, ya Muhammad, ya Ali.  Thank you.  Thank you.  There he goes.  The Iron Sheik.  The freestyle and Greco-Roman.  Greco.  Iron Sheik.  Oh, no.  Right.  There goes the Sheik.  Look at this guy.  You're not going to kill him. 
[02:35:00]  Okay.  You're a big guy.  I wouldn't mess with you.  He's a big guy.  Look at him.  I know.  Give him a couple pictures of everybody.  Iron Sheik.  Iron Sheik.  Give a picture.  Come here, ya big bastard.  Look at ya.  Who's more out of it?  I got an Iron Sheik hug.  Thank you, my friend.  Thank you, my friend.  Give to me a picture.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Thank you, Iron Sheik.  I got mine, aren't you?  Yes.  There you go.  Okay.  Thank you, my friend.  We're going to play What Do We Learn Next, Ant. 
[02:35:30]  Yes.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  What do you do here?  Look, look, look at breasts.  If I wasn't on this show, I'd be out there with a wow sticker just trolling for breasts.  Thank you, perverts.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  We got to get right into what do we learn today on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Got to love the Iron Sheik, huh, Ant?  Oh, my God.  Steve's got some great audio of the guy trying to do an ID for our show.  Someone actually wrote, this is a bit, right? 
[02:36:00]  Like, that was pretty cool.  Eric, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  First of all, I wanted to tell you that I learned today that thanks to Verizon, Jim Norton is a Harry Hothead.  Oh, hey, boss.  This didn't work.  No, it didn't get boss.  Kevin, what's going on?  What's happening, guys?  Hey.  Very educational show.  Yeah.  I learned that Star Jones' birthday party in Jamaica had blunts and bunts. 
[02:36:30]  Yes.  I learned that Star Jones is to a sub as the shark was to Quint.  Yep.  Yep.  And that the grease man still can't get a job.  What a doodle.  And lastly, I learned that Vos makes Keanu Reeves look like Olivier.  Very good.  That's educational.  Thank you.  Awesome Garrett checking in.  Awesome Garrett.  Yeah, I learned a couple of things.  Yeah, go ahead.  First of all, I learned that Star Jones' shoes look like pink rubber erasers.  Yeah. 
[02:37:00]  And I also learned that there's only two things that suck worse than Vos' set.  Verizon and the Sheik's English.  See y'all later.  Later.  Verizon does suck.  I've got to say, we like when you guys use nicknames that pertain to the show.  Steve, what's going on?  Awesome Garrett checking in.  That's nice.  Yeah, I learned that brain-eating disease is funnier than Ulcer 2.  Than Ulcer 2.  Yes, we did learn that.  Very good.  And then Norton's tickets at the TRLA, not sold out yet.  No, the TLA is sold. 
[02:37:30]  There was a few press tickets that were released that I didn't know.  All right.  Well, you can go get them.  It's not the TRLA either, you maniac.  All right.  Scott, what did you learn on the show today?  Yeah, I learned that the Iron Sheik's family in Tehran, Iran, probably have more electronic  equipment than Jim Norton has in his New York apartment.  Yeah, he's got no DVDs, no VCRs, no TVs.  Verizon sucks.  Thank you.  Yes.  Scumbag, big business, treat people like garbage.  Jumbo Joe from Cleveland.  I learned today Star Jones is 5'6 in the morning, 5'2 at night. 
[02:38:00]  Randy from Yonkers today, I learned that the two fake Os were as sexy as the fluid in Dudley  Moore's bunion.  And Tuttle, I learned that Bill O'Reilly starred in Shoot Out at the Bang Bang Corral.  We're done, man.  Hi, Garrett.  That's an awesome Garrett.  We've got a couple pairs of tickets to see.  Mr. Jim Norton tomorrow night at the TLA in Philly.  So if you're from Philly, stay on the line if you don't have your Jim Norton tickets yet,  okay?  Right. 
[02:38:30]  Boss, thank you.  Thank you.  Thanks for being a good sport.  That was hilarious.  Next week, I'll be handing out WoW stickers at the Comics Cafe, too, when I'm working there.  I'm going to bring a bunch up.  And that's in Rochester?  Yeah.  All weekend, next weekend?  Next, uh, the 3rd through the 7th.  3rd through the 7th in Rochester.  Comics Cafe.  Go do Brother Weez's show for us, all right?  Yeah, I'm going to go up there.  All right.  All right, Ant.  This was a lot of fun.  We'll see you all tomorrow.  Hopefully, uh, the Oz game tomorrow.  A new version of the Oz game.  Boss, look out.  Kabooby. 
[02:39:00]  That's not.  That's Earl.  I would have smelled him.  Oh, God.  Oh, gosh.  Jesus Christ.  Man, whoa.  Hey, you should have heard what he said in the middle of his head at one point.  Yeah.  In the middle of his tape thing, I looked over like, are you a madman?  Why didn't you say that on the Death Comedy Jam?  I apologize to our brothers of color for Boss' act.  Yes.  Apologize to all people. 
[02:39:30]  That's true.  Boss is actually blacker than Walter Coppage.  Walter Coppage?  Yes.  Do you know who he is?  I'm going to have to think about that one.  It's going to hit me on the way home tonight, I think.  And I want to tussle his hair.  Sorry.  Thank you.  Young Garrett.  There's Garrett.  Oh, your tussleable hair.  Oh, God.  Take off that cap and give it a tussle and some encouragement.  This is how we end tonight?  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right. </pre>
