<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Super Show broadcast began with technical difficulties involving DJ Denny's microphone.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, then discussed their upcoming "Super Show 2," contrasting it with previous successful shows featuring guests like Ricky Gervais and Joe Rogan.  This Super Show would feature Rich Voss, DJ Who Kid, penthouse girls participating in "Super Show Games" (with cash prizes), Bo Bo, Stalker Patty, Lady Di, and the significant return of Marion, whose past appearance involved a YouTube video and a racial slur.  A substantial portion of the show focused on Jay Leno's final Tonight Show appearance, interspersed with humorous tangents including Mike Buschetti's Instagram videos, childhood fruit and vegetable experiences, and a graphic, comedic description of a segment featuring Sandy and a painted object nicknamed "Twato" (described as genital herpes).  The news of Scott Shannon's retirement from radio was also announced.

The show featured regular contributors Lady Di and Marion. It opened with a discussion of a "rough" photo of Lady Di applying makeup. Marion's recent illness and upcoming cruise were discussed, along with a significant back-and-forth between her and Lady Di.  Marion expressed concerns about Lady Di's drinking, smoking, alleged bed bugs, and lifestyle, reading texts criticizing Lady Di's cleanliness.  Lady Di's living situation, alleged previous leaking incidents, and disinterest in pornography were also topics.  The hosts appealed to listeners to avoid sending photoshopped pornographic images of Lady Di. A call from "Pal" from *90 Day Fianc√©* regarding visa issues and a contentious interaction with a caller named Bob followed. Colin Quinn's absence was attributed to a car accident. Musical interludes occurred.  Later, a discussion with Rich Voss included comments on Lady Di's appearance and lifestyle, a movie they filmed together, and Lady Di briefly showing her breasts to Dave Chappelle (off-air). The show continued with additional guests.

The broadcast included extensive discussions about movies and cruises, and increasingly bizarre and sexually charged interactions with female guests Lady Di, Bonnie, Marion, and a pregnant Nicole.  Crude banter focused on their bodies, with repeated requests to show breasts and buttocks, discussions of bodily fluids, and offensive descriptions of their physical attributes.  Male guest Who Kid further escalated the explicitness of the conversations. DJ Danny and comedian Bobo were also present, with Bobo's participation culminating in progressive undressing and a bizarre performance involving a jelly donut and his genitals.  Penthouse girls arrived, adding to the sexually charged atmosphere.  The conversation briefly touched upon a comedian's shows and Hustler magazine.

A segment focused on the death of Ralph Kiner, transitioning quickly to discussions of penthouse girls in the studio. Bobo's arousal and deflation in their presence became a running joke.  A sponsored Twister game with the penthouse girls and Bobo devolved into comments about body odor and bodily functions.  Guests included Lexi Love (publicist) and Lady Di, whose appearance and behavior were subject to crude commentary.  Discussions of sexual acts and preferences were prominent.  The segment concluded with a graphic description of a lap dance competition judged by Stalker Patty.

A later segment detailed lap dances given to various male participants, including Mike Puschetti.  Patty's initial awkwardness (due to neck arthritis) during a lap dance from Mary Jean was noted.  Numerous crude and sexually suggestive comments were made throughout.  Mary Jean and Lexi provided lap dances, culminating in a three-woman simultaneous lap dance for Puschetti.  The hosts' commentary heavily involved vulgar language, sexual innuendo, and jokes about the women's bodies and the men's reactions.  References to movies and pop culture were interspersed. The overall tone remained irreverent, crude, and sexually explicit.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Enough of this plava, let's hear this show on the road.  We got freaks, we got idiots, and monstrosities about.  The Super Show, the Super Show, the Opie and Anthony Super Show.  One, two, three, four.  Good morning, it's DJ Dennis in Rockin' the House live and in studio on the Opie and Anthony Super Show.  We're back, one more time, to explode on your radio. 
[00:00:30]  Jesus.  Explode on your radio.  That sounds dangerous.  You were a little low in the mix, by the way.  Good morning, everyone.  Uh-oh.  Wow, there's a little echo.  Is Jimmy's mic on?  How's that? Does that sound better?  No.  I think you're the problem, Denny.  Is that your mic?  Goodbye.  Could have to ride your mic a little bit.  Denny was the problem.  Hope's going to have to ride that mic. 
[00:01:00]  Denny, say something.  Good morning.  We could use a little more volume from you, but if I do it on the board, then there's an echo.  Then there's an echo, everybody.  And echo.  Oh, what's E-Rock doing?  He's adding a little gain with his shaky hand.  Oh, he's so shaky.  Why do you have a shaky hand?  You're not old enough to have a shaky hand.  It's a lot of caffeine, I've told you.  Oh.  Likes caffeine now.  Yeah.  Is that better?  It is better, unfortunately. 
[00:01:30]  I was hoping it would be a major problem where we would have to just turn your mic off for the day.  Yeah.  Love you, Denny.  Love you.  Miss you.  Nice to be back.  Well, it certainly is.  Nice to have you.  Well, really?  Well, I'd just say that.  You got some Asia over there?  Sure, I get some Asia.  The first super group.  Look at the hard drive it hits.  It's right there.  You're echoey, too, man.  I'm echoey because...  Because Jimmy's mic is back on.  Oh, what happened, man?  All right.  Why don't we, like, push Jimmy's mic down for a little bit? 
[00:02:00]  Oh, thank you.  Oh, that's super group.  Hey, you see ya.  Will you talk it up, at least?  Oh, I just thought you wanted me to play it for you so you could enjoy it.  I didn't want to ruin the record.  Well, now it's too late.  He's singing.  Jesus.  He says we're talking.  I hear you.  Hard drive it hits.  Yeah.  It's right there.  It's like a famous thing.  I'm telling you right now.  And I don't know anything.  Uh-huh.  As you know, I don't know much.  I'm telling you right now, Asia's going to be in this tiny little studio. 
[00:02:30]  I think it's going to happen.  I'm telling you right now, it's going to happen.  I haven't even asked for it to happen.  No.  I just know it's going to happen.  Now, if it were to happen, would you like it better?  Do-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de 
[00:03:00]  It's in your eyes, Danny on the one and two.  It's a load disguising it, it really comes as no surprise to find that you planned it  all alone. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  Something fell.  Rocked a little too hard there.  Yeah, a little too hard of some rocking.  The keyboard doesn't approve of Asia.  Super group Asia, of course.  Danny had a request for me the other day.  He said, let me know when your pool opening party is so I could, you know, clear that calendar  so I could book them on that.  And I'm like, this is a good idea.  You got it on the docket yet? 
[00:04:00]  Not yet.  Not yet.  I think I will be opening the pool April 1st, regardless of the weather.  Jesus.  And then...  That's not that far away.  It's not that far off.  The good thing is, though, then I could start running the jacuzzi anyway, so, you know,  even if it's cold out, you can still get in the jacuzzi.  You start to ramp up.  Yeah.  And then you don't have a problem when you do have those couple of nice warm days.  You're not sitting there going, ah, I wish the pool was open.  It'll be open.  It'll be open.  It'll be open.  It'll be open.  Open for business. 
[00:04:30]  All right.  Well, thanks, Danny.  That was wonderful.  Yeah.  We can go home now.  So, I guess this is Super Show 2.  Oh, yeah.  Super Show 2.  I got to be honest.  We're taking a chance with the Super Show concept today.  Oh, yeah?  Because the first one was a massive success.  And who knew?  We just kind of walked into it.  Right.  Now, this one is actually planned.  Yeah.  And you know, the best laid plans.  We suck at planning anything.  We are terrible at planning events. 
[00:05:00]  We're way better just fucking flying by the seat of our pants.  Off the old cuff, as they say.  Yeah.  We've made a living off that.  It makes everyone around us extremely nervous, but we've made a good living off it.  We are synonymous with the term winging it.  Yeah, but not only do you wing it, but whenever you plan something, it's almost as if you purposely sabotage it.  Ah, you know what, then?  Because it's planned.  It could be.  Like you're rebelling against the idea of plans.  Oh, wow.  What was that?  I think Denny put his live mic down.  Hot mics. 
[00:05:30]  I didn't know it was still on.  I thought you said it was hot.  You should know when a mic is hot.  I don't have a pot in front of me.  You should have a pot for your own mic.  Right.  And then, oh, I'm going to keep it up on the board there.  Then you could, you know, you could work it.  Okay.  I like to keep it down when I'm not working.  You know, I'm going to turn your mic off, but if you've got something, just let us know.  We'll turn you back on.  There we go.  Yeah, we like to wing shit.  Yeah.  It's been 20 years of winging shit.  Winging it.  Just fucking will-o'-the-wisp, as they say.  Just letting it ride. 
[00:06:00]  We have tried the other way.  It just doesn't work.  Oh, it just never works.  Nah.  We've had a lot of people sit us down and go, can't you plan anything?  Like, what are you guys doing tomorrow on your show?  Oh.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Who knows?  We'll find out when we get there.  Like, find out when you get there.  We'll all be surprised.  Right.  Do you know what was really kind of interesting when I checked my email?  And after, like you said, 20 years of doing this, I saw Sam's email with a whole, like, time breakdown. 
[00:06:30]  That made me nervous.  It made me nervous, too.  I'm not kidding.  I was like, ah!  I told Jess that I did that, and I said, these two are going to freak the fuck out when they get a rundown of tomorrow's show.  Then I started chuckling, because I looked at the first thing at 6.30, and I was like, well, after that, it all falls apart anyway.  Yeah, we just got to do something at 6.30.  I don't even know what it is anymore. 
[00:07:00]  I looked at it once, and it was very impressive, and I even wrote to him, wow, thank you.  This is very impressive.  Any real radio show would be thrilled to have that.  Okay, good.  We, on the other hand, got nervous.  I think we probably could have been more successful if we, like, kind of planned things, but I don't know.  It's way more fun to do it this way.  It is.  Sometimes you fall hard.  I'm not even going to fucking lie to the listeners.  Some days it's like, oh, fuck, maybe we should have planned something. 
[00:07:30]  Well, that didn't work.  But those days when you're just fucking fooling around and figuring it out in front of the people, but then you get into a groove and it works, there's nothing better than that.  And most radio guys cannot do that.  That's the secret.  No, they're scared.  They have to have every minute of their show planned.  I think it's because we're as entertained by what's going on as everyone else, because we didn't have a clue what was going to happen either.  So it's like, oh, shit, that's pretty funny.  One of my favorite things we did this week was that dumb bad finger break, which some people say we've done already, but I think we made it even different this time. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, we got a little more in.  I enjoyed the fuck out of that, because we were just weaving and trying to fucking, you know, figure it out.  We were doing a little investigating, commentary.  And the caller calls in with the same story.  And then it just worked.  So anyway, it's Super Show 2, and most people are like, shouldn't the Super Show be when Ricky Gervais and Joe Rogan were in? 
[00:08:30]  What?  That's a true Super Show.  Did someone say that?  Yes, they did.  Christ almighty.  What about the time Louis C.K. and Penn Jillette came in?  That's actually what you should call a Super Show.  No, you're just so stupid.  That is stupid, right?  There'd be no irony if we said that.  Yeah, we're all about sarcasm, dry wits, irony.  Who doesn't get that?  It's much better to have a Super Show when...  With idiots.  When Lady Di comes in.  With knuckleheads. 
[00:09:00]  Right.  Knuckleheads.  Hey, hey, hey.  Hey.  That's the listeners.  Yeah, hey, knucklehead.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, the hardcore fans are called knuckleheads now.  They used to be called Pess.  We never called them the Army, right?  The ONA Army.  Oh, God.  We never had a...  Maybe as a goof.  I hope it was...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We never went down that dumb road.  We love the Army.  Hey, the ONA Army!  Oh, God.  That's embarrassing.  I don't think we did that. 
[00:09:30]  And if we did, it was for a goof.  Yeah.  For a goof!  So who do we have coming in for the Super Show today?  Oh.  Because the lineup has been changing.  And, oh, I said, you know, we're risking it today.  Because if this doesn't work, then the Super Show concept might have to go away.  Oh, yeah.  Or for a long time, at least.  Maybe retool.  Right.  And the Super Show worked because, you know, Jim Norton was here.  Colin Quinn was here, who just loves the fuck out of these people that we're bringing in today.  And the Cosmo Radio Show.  We don't have that at our... 
[00:10:00]  We're not allowed to do that, right?  Now I'd just be barging into somebody's show.  This goes back to the point I made earlier this week.  Every time we know we have an amazing show, it's always the days we get in trouble.  Yeah.  What is the problem with Cosmo?  Well, there's no...  There was a problem that day.  There's no problem today, per se.  It's just...  But shouldn't they open their doors again because it works so well for both shows?  Open their doors to us.  I would think so, but apparently the PD was not super psyched. 
[00:10:30]  But that's a dumb PD.  Because they said it's not the...  This isn't our audience.  They really don't want to hear about a woman's lover getting thrown in front of a train.  And he doesn't get it.  No, they do.  That's a dumb PD surprise.  Nobody's changing the channel.  No one is changing the channel.  I mean, if you did the...  Here's the...  I just never wanted to be a program director.  I would have been the greatest one of all time.  I'll tell you right the fuck now.  Here's the deal.  If you did that every day on Cosmo, that would be a major fucking issue.  No problem. 
[00:11:00]  But if you just throw it in there every once in a while, like, what the fuck is happening today?  No one is turning off Cosmo Radio.  That's part of that fan base.  People are fixed on it.  Staring at the radio.  Right.  Unbelieving of what they're hearing.  No one would have turned that off.  So who's the program director?  I don't know who it is.  You can write it down.  I'll make believe I looked it up.  I really don't know.  I mean, even if I did, I wouldn't tell you, but I don't know who it is.  But for the people that didn't listen to the first Super Show, Sam dragged them into Cosmo Radio because they had an open-door policy that day. 
[00:11:30]  It just so happens on the day we have all these crazy people coming in, and they were just saying outrageous, wild stuff, which, sure, might make the Cosmo audience go, oh, my God.  Right.  But they're not turning off their radio, like Ann said.  There's no fucking way.  Oh, Ann, nah.  We walk away from that going, wow, that was amazing for us to hear how uncomfortable Taylor was, and who was the guy?  Kenny.  And Kenny.  He did a very good job as well.  And I think they even enjoyed it.  I think they did, too.  But as soon as the show ended, they got a talking to. 
[00:12:00]  Yes.  A big talking to.  Talking to, yes.  And that's just dumb.  Once again, going with, if you do a really good radio show, it's a problem.  The Pat Cooper thing is a major problem around here.  Oh, what happened there?  A major problem.  I missed that one.  It's an 85-year-old guy rambling and, you know.  An 85-year-old guy just going off.  A sharp 85-year-old guy who I love to death.  You know, but some people just can't take that.  You don't have to say that.  He can't hear it. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, I know.  But in the end, it doesn't affect anything.  Nothing.  We move on.  Howard will still be whatever he is.  The company will be fine.  Exactly.  But for some reason, man, those over-the-top shows, it just gets people fucking mad or something.  Well, we're going to see if we can get ourselves in trouble today.  Let's, uh...  All right.  So, we don't have Colin.  We don't have Jim Norton.  No.  No.  We do have Rich Voss, who we picked for this.  And?  Because he's very good at this type of thing.  Rich is fun with the little crowd work. 
[00:13:00]  Yes.  Rich Voss will be sitting in the Jim Norton seat.  Okay.  In the Colin Quinn seat, DJ Who Kid.  I like that, too.  Oh, I forgot about the DJ Who Kid.  DJ Who Kid.  He will be here early.  Let me tell you something.  What?  That guy...  945?  Yeah.  That guy can add live commentary.  Okay, good.  He's good, man.  He's great.  And there's going to be moisture in the studio, so...  A lot of moisture.  Literally and figuratively.  Right.  We'll have some penthouse girls coming in.  Whoa.  Hot penthouse girls. 
[00:13:30]  Fuck.  One of them...  Whoa.  ...at the end of yesterday's show...  Oh, we found out something.  Who Kid said he fucked her in a car?  Damn.  Jesus.  That's great.  Does that mean he carjacked her?  You're fucked.  Get out.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, so we'll have the penthouse girls, and without giving away any events, they'll  be participating in the first-ever Super Show Games.  The Super Show Games.  Yes, this is great.  The Super Show Games.  Opie, this was so thought-out.  And by the way, there are even prizes. 
[00:14:00]  There's three girls.  They're each going to win cash.  Right.  Cash.  So they'll be competing.  Wow.  Yeah.  Did we ever do cash for gash?  I think so.  Yeah.  Sounds like something we'd have done.  Wait, I thought you'd think it was mine.  Overall, it is mine.  We'd have been to me.  Cash for gash.  Cash for gash.  Do what you're gritting.  Have you heard any new scores?  What's your clips?  They're fucking fantastic.  They're fantastic.  I got to-you know how we're-I swear I just thought of something. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah?  A couple things.  Oh, this is the part where we get in trouble.  Is it going to mess up your schedule?  Am I going to need to edit my schedule?  Oh, shit.  Let me pick up the schedule here.  Is it going to mess up your schedule?  Could.  A couple things.  Because Rich Voss is coming in, and recently it was played-I guess it was the day we took  after the Super Bowl, where Voss tries to name celebrities, and he did it with Mars.  Right.  I think him and Mike Buschetti, there has to be a competition.  That's a great idea.  So can we work on some celebrity pictures?  Yes.  And honestly, one of the bits on the schedule, I won't say which one, at this moment in time 
[00:15:00]  I don't have full confidence in.  So if that one's a dud, we put the kibosh on it and we do some celebrity photos.  Let's do celebrity photos, because Rich Voss is terrific.  He really knows celebrities.  Yes.  And we'll give Mike Buschetti the other slot in that.  Buschetti's fucking Instagram videos are just the greatest thing I've ever fucking seen.  He puts the camera right up to his face, where you only see, like, his upper lip and eyeballs  and nose. 
[00:15:30]  Right.  And then just spouts off the most inane, rambling, I don't know what, and I'm fascinated by it.  And then it just ends.  And then it just abruptly ends.  Like, most people, when you try to do an Instagram or a Vine...  You plan out the time.  You plan out the time.  If it doesn't work, you just hit the lead and go, fuck, all right, how do I do this?  I gotta fit this shit in.  He is Ed Wood when it comes to one take.  You don't give a fuck.  Just play the latest one.  Play the latest one.  Mike Buschetti on Instagram. 
[00:16:00]  I love him.  Oh, wait.  I don't get that today because of this?  Oh, shit.  We don't get computer sound?  We don't get computer sound because of this?  Damn.  Oh, boy.  Suffice to say, it's hilarious.  Hmm.  I don't know what happened.  How, how, how.  Well, that was a mistake.  That was a mistake.  Yeah, because that...  We use that a lot.  Yeah, well, now, today, it's, uh, it's, uh, what do I do?  Oh, here comes E-Rock.  You hit the PC button.  You covered it. 
[00:16:30]  We had to move it.  What happened?  Oh, you moved it.  Okay.  Let's go.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  E-Rock.  Look at E-Rock.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  E-Rock's stepping up.  It sure is.  Yes.  Yuck.  Ha.  All right, let's go.  Hey, everybody.  A long time ago, this is how bullies were dealt with.  Yeah!  Yeah!  But today, it's settled over a frappuccino.  What have we become?  I don't know.  What do you hold up? 
[00:17:00]  A medieval mace.  I know.  I know it was something like that, but you couldn't see it, because like you said, it's  an extreme close-up on one of his eyes and a nostril.  Oh, it's brutal.  What's the, what's that one?  Let me hear one more.  Everybody, this is the ultimate test, to see if a woman is right for me.  You like shiny?  Then I know I've got to keep her.  He was holding up a key. 
[00:17:30]  Right.  What was the key for?  I don't know.  Apparently, if women like shiny things, they like him.  They like him.  But it was just a key.  Right.  I guess he just gets these ideas and goes with it immediately.  You ever get an idea for an Instagram or a tweet, and then you think it over for a few  seconds and go like, meh, you might even get to the point where you're typing, and then  you go, meh, fuck it.  Right.  I don't think he has that.  I finally decided to edit myself.  You're editing?  I've been deleting a lot of, I've been deleting a lot of tweets instead of sending them. 
[00:18:00]  Pre-send deletes?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Trying to get a little smarter about it.  Would you like to save draft?  No.  No, thank you.  It doesn't look good.  Nah, it's not quite gelling.  Right.  So we got Voss, DJ Hookin, Mike Buschetti, obviously, and who else coming in today?  Confirmation, Bo Bo's on his way.  Okay.  Great.  Bo Bo.  We have Stalker Patty scheduled to be here.  She's on the schedule. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  She'll get off.  Okay.  And, wait till you hear this.  Uh-huh.  Not only do we have Lady Di.  Uh-huh.  Lady Di.  But we also have Marion.  Whoa!  What?  She decided to, uh...  Marion is coming.  No, fuck it.  I had no idea.  I know.  I wanted it to be a nice surprise.  Oh, that's huge.  Which is great, because let me tell you, the Voss-Marion dynamic is fantastic.  Okay, good.  Because Voss will just light her up, and she won't take any shit. 
[00:19:00]  No.  No.  She's a spitfire, as they say.  She is quite a spitfire.  I guess her stomach bug is okay.  Yeah.  Nice.  Now, we haven't seen Marion.  And I know the only reason Marion's coming is because Lady Di is coming.  Yeah.  Right.  And Marion doesn't want Lady Di here without her.  Well, we talked about this on the pre-show a little bit.  What makes this compelling to me is that Marion hasn't been here since she got mad at Opie for the YouTube video.  Which YouTube video?  Where she was shouting the N-word.  Oh, wow. 
[00:19:30]  But it was obvious that she got a pass.  Yeah.  Who Kidd gave her a pass?  From the Who Kidd.  Yeah.  Who Kidd gives out a lot of passes.  He's very free with passes.  Who Kidd gave her a pass?  Who Kidd gave her a pass on the word?  Who Kidd's pass is like illegal prescriptions.  Yeah.  He just hands them out to people that probably shouldn't be using it.  Right.  What, do you get headaches?  Yeah, here's a pass.  Here you go.  Here's a pass.  What do you need?  She'll be fine.  Oh, yeah.  I think so.  Who Dad?  Who Dad?  And now that we have a DJ, we can properly celebrate her birthday. 
[00:20:00]  That's true.  If she's here.  Okay.  Yeah.  That'll be good.  Denny.  All right.  Denny Falcone is spinning some of the classics and some of the new stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's got some stuff for the kids, too.  Hard drive of hits.  Oh, yeah.  That's all you got is a laptop.  And the hard drive of hits.  Turn the mic there.  And the hard drive of hits.  You know, it's also the Cabin Fever Reliever Weekend, right?  We've had so much cold weather.  What?  So let's crank up some summer tunes. 
[00:20:30]  The Cabin Fever Reliever Weekend.  A lot of festivities going on, I tell you.  So let's warm things up and bring Mungo Jerry in.  Grab your bathing suit because we're having a party on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Whoa, nice.  You hit the ramp and everything, but we didn't ask for a song.  It's just, it's in his blood.  Okay.  You can't stop him.  I was just asking about the laptop.  It does feel like it should be warmer out.  Yes.  When you listen to Mungo Jerry. 
[00:21:00]  And, of course, we'll have live photos and the like of the O and A show.  Oh, yeah.  I am going to have to go greet some of our guests.  Oh, are they arriving?  Oh, yes.  Oh, this is so exciting.  Who's here first?  Well, I just got a little email from the security desk.  Bobo.  It's not Bobo.  Oh, wow.  There's got to be Lady Diane Marion.  They are.  All right.  It's a building.  All right.  We want them in first by themselves. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  Well, that's what, as a matter of fact, good.  You're following the schedule.  Oh, really?  Yes.  They are.  There's a lot of time for you to just have small chat with Lady Diane Marion.  This is great.  I love this schedule thing.  Oh, my God.  There's a lot of things on the schedule.  Oh, my God.  We have to keep the schedule to fit it all in.  Don't get nervous.  Could you pencil in some poo time?  Oh.  Let me see where I can actually see.  You didn't leave any time for duties?  Right.  Could you pencil in the poo time?  That is an oversight on my part.  These NutriBullet smoothies are making things flow nicely. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, boy.  By the way, today is also two weeks from Dr. Ian Smith's return in the big final weigh-in.  Oh, look at E-Rock.  Just like E-Rock.  Wait, E-Rock's got a NutriBullet.  He's got a little NutriBullet.  Wait, let's match the colors.  I think we fucking nailed it today.  Oh, wow.  You guys are drinking the same fucking thing.  What do you got in there?  A little leafy greens in there?  It's bacon, chocolate. 
[00:22:30]  Why would I ruin it with chocolate?  What do you got in there?  This, I think it's blueberry, raspberry, some vanilla yogurt.  There might be a little honey.  And that's it?  Yeah.  You didn't go with the leafy green?  We've got to rotate it.  Oh, yeah, you're on a strict diet.  I'm just fucking around.  Some of them have cucumber and kale, and some are just kind of fruit-based.  Today's is a leafy spinach, a little kale, blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, a banana, water, and oatmeal. 
[00:23:00]  Something tells me.  A little oatmeal on the top.  There's got to be something else that has the exact same nutritional value of kale,  so that kale can just be destroyed and run off the face of the earth.  Kale's rough.  Kale.  That's a weed.  Ugh, kale.  There was a reason no one ate kale until, what, two years ago?  Yeah, like two years ago.  Two years ago, people decided we've got to eat kale.  No one did anything.  Oh, God. 
[00:23:30]  They mowed it down with their lawnmowers.  Yes, yes.  And now it's some fucking thing that you're supposed to eat.  Man, we just, I don't know, our lifespan is a weird one.  When we grew up, there was no kale.  Kale!  Well, half the vegetables and fruits that you now see in the grocery store weren't around when we were coming up.  They just weren't around.  What do you want, banana?  Have a banana.  Yeah, it's a banana and a dumb.  That's a jab.  Have an apple.  We had one apple.  Well, we did have a delicious apple, which was the crackly one.  We had two apples.  We had Macintosh. 
[00:24:00]  We had two apples you could choose from.  Right.  We only had one orange you could choose from.  That was it.  The Florida orange.  No, my mom got the cheap ones with the extremely almost transparent skin.  Impossible to peel.  I hated it with a ton of fucking pits because they were cheaper at walled pounds.  I liked the good sun-kissed navel orange where you could take the peel off in one piece.  We were too poor for that shit.  But when I went to my friend's house and they had a navel orange, I went in.  Oh, the peel's like Kevlar.  Oh, my God.  Although, it used to trick you because you would, you know, peel that shit and your huge 
[00:24:30]  orange would turn out to be a golf ball sometimes.  Yeah, because the peel is like so thick.  Real thick.  Just protecting all that goodness.  Yes.  Yeah, you get a grape-sized orange inside that fucking thing.  Yeah, that and a good mealy apple.  Horrible apple that you think is going to, like, go when you bite into it and then it's  just like fucking cement.  Oh, my mom.  Macintosh.  Yeah, Macintosh. 
[00:25:00]  I've said this many times, but it's the truth.  My mom got the bruised apples because they were on sale.  They actually had a bruised apple section.  It's terrible to bite into.  Well, you wouldn't bite the bruise.  But if you can't see it under the skin sometimes, you take a bite and it's just this soft, mushy  crap.  What the fuck is that about?  Like, if you have an apple, it's awesome, but it hits the floor and you pick it up and  eat that part of the apple that literally just hit the floor, it tastes like shit.  I know.  I don't know what happens.  That is the weirdest thing.  This is our food.  Honeycrisp.  Huh?  It's our fruit break?  Honeycrisp.  Fruit break. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, then a good thing sells here.  Did you get it?  Because you're gay.  That's uncomfortable laughter.  I know.  All right.  Jay Leno is done.  I feel bad for Jay Leno, even though he's like a billionaire.  It just doesn't seem right that they just forced him out again.  And we're all about Jimmy Fallon.  Trust me.  We love Jimmy Fallon.  We're team Jimmy Fallon.  As far as the late night wars go.  We are all about Fallon, I do believe. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  And I understand, you know, why they're doing it all, but Jay just delivered time and time  again, and they just are forcing him out again.  Yeah.  I think they really are kind of just planning for the future at this point.  I think when you look at the last couple of years of Johnny and stuff, he really did start  looking old and, you know, he was slowing down and everything.  And I don't think they want to get to that point.  I don't think Jay was at all, but I don't think they ever wanted to get to that point. 
[00:26:30]  He's only popped someone like Fallon in there.  Right.  The new young guy.  It makes sense for NBC, but it just seems like Jay's been, you know, fucked over here  and there.  This business is pretty goddamn shitty.  And by this, I mean the one I'm not even involved in.  So, uh, did you watch his final show?  I didn't watch.  I did not watch either.  It was on too late for me.  I figured I'd catch the clips.  Yeah, absolutely.  And we'll do that now, I guess.  Um, what was this?  Is this his goodbye?  Yeah.  I wonder where our good friend Kevin Eubanks couldn't be here. 
[00:27:00]  Kevin is on tour.  He's in France right now.  He called me today.  So fine.  Fuck you.  We'll be back the next week.  So if you wonder where Kevin Eubanks is, he's with us in spirit, certainly.  Okay.  Wow.  He couldn't come back for his final show.  What's that about?  I want to thank you, the audience.  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  You folks have been just incredibly loyal.  Oh, no.  This is tricky.  Uh.  Secondly, this is him.  Oh, Sal doesn't know how to run the computer. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Sal doesn't know how to run it.  Oh, Sal's running it instead of our own Sam Roberts.  Yeah.  So he doesn't know how to pause.  And now you've got to back it up a little bit.  Now you've got to back it up a little.  Right.  There we go.  Now you're learning.  Someone goes, oh.  This is tricky.  Uh, we wouldn't be on the air if that's for people.  Well, that's true.  Secondly, this has been the greatest 22 years of my life.  22 years. 
[00:28:00]  They should have timed it to where he leaves when all of that skunk thing has gone from the  front of his hair.  Yeah.  He has a couple of years left.  He's still a couple of years of skunk thing.  Skunk.  The luckiest guy in the world.  I got to meet presidents, astronauts, movie stars.  O.N.A.  O.N.A.  It's just been incredible.  I got to work with whining people who made me look better.  Look at those fucking egomaniacs. 
[00:28:30]  Please stink.  We both blurt that out.  Very surprising to say O.N.A. in there.  Oh, man.  Who runs the gamut?  My God.  Presidents, astronauts, and O.N.A.  I got to meet presidents, astronauts, movie stars.  It's just been incredible.  The professor and Mary Ann.  I got to work with writing people who made me look better than I really am.  I got to work with audio people who made me sound better than I really do.  And I got to work with producers and writers. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, Jesus Christ, Jay.  And just all kinds of talented people who made me look a lot smarter.  Where's Jay from, by the way?  Oh, um.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, um.  Where's Miss Jay from?  I don't know.  I'm 18 years old.  Oh, wait a minute.  Pause.  Oh, no.  Sal anxiously grabbed the mic to give us the real answer.  Oh, be honest.  Sal.  Be honest.  I was going to pull up his wiki. 
[00:29:30]  I know where he's from.  Oh, Sal.  From Massachusetts.  We all know that.  Of course.  We were going for a bit there.  Oh, Sal.  Did you see him grab the mic?  I saw him.  He wanted to be the Johnny-on-the-spot hero.  Why would we need the real answer there?  I don't know.  He didn't say Ohio.  Are you getting a little sweaty there?  Yes, I am.  You're heating up.  I see you're a little red.  Heating up already.  Fuck.  What time is it?  Ah, shit.  So I don't know where Jay is from.  Yeah.  From 18 years ago, I left Dayton, Ohio. 
[00:30:00]  Oh.  With two very bad knees.  Hello?  In a dream to become a Major League Baseball player.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  We'll never know what happened.  Oh, no.  It's a shame.  I thank God this dream came true.  Oh, it did.  I thank God this dream came true.  Oh.  Oh, my cars.  My wife, Mavis.  All right, keep going with this.  Yeah, let's roll. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, boy.  First year of this show, I lost my mom.  Where'd she go?  Second year of this.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, no.  Then my brother died.  What?  And after that, I was not family.  That's terrific.  And the folks here became my family.  Holy shit.  Consequently, when they went through rough times, I tried to be there for them.  The last time we left this show, you might remember, you had the 64 children that were  born among all our staffers that married. 
[00:31:00]  And that was a great moment.  Jesus.  And what people say to me, hey, why don't you go to ABC, why don't you go to Fox, why don't  you go?  I didn't know anybody over there.  These are the only people I've ever known.  I'm also proud to say this is a union show, and I have never worked.  Uh-oh.  I have never worked with a more professional group of people in my life.  They get paid good money, and they do a good job. 
[00:31:30]  And when the guys and women on this show would show me the new car they bought or the house  up the street here in Burbank that one of the guys got, I felt I played a bigger role in  their success as they played in mine.  It's not about you.  And that was just a great job.  Oh, wait, it is.  And I'm really excited for Jimmy Fallon.  You know, it's fun to kind of be the old guy and sit back here and see where the next  generation takes this great institution.  And it really is.  It's been a great institution for 60 years.  I'm so glad I got to be a part of it. 
[00:32:00]  But it really is time to go and hand it off to the next guy.  It really is.  And in closing, I want to quote Johnny Carson, who was the greatest guy to ever do this  job.  And he said, I bid you all a heartfelt commitment.  Now.  Oh, wait.  Now that I brought the room down.  Certainly did.  Hey, Garth, you got anything to liven this party up?  Give it a shot.  Jesus.  Was there a big musical number after that? 
[00:32:30]  That was fucking heavy, man.  Right?  That's some heavy shit right there.  You don't want to see crying, Jay.  No.  Christ almighty.  I never understood why people hated on him.  Because we met the guy.  He was a class act.  Nothing but nice, cordial, friendly.  Nothing but a class act.  Yeah.  Wow.  He's not done, by the way.  Nah, he'll definitely pop up somewhere.  He's not done.  I wonder what he'll do next.  Unlike Johnny Carson, you know, who decided not to do anything after he left. 
[00:33:00]  Fell off the face of the earth.  Johnny Carson.  I think Jay takes just a little time, and then he pops up in the fall.  I bet you he pops up in the fall somewhere.  Yeah.  Unless he's got to play out the rest of his contract.  Oh, you think he might have to sit?  I think he still has contract time.  And NBC, you know, if they want the whole Fallon thing to, you know, take off and work.  They don't want any distractions.  Yeah, they're not going to let Jay do anything until the end of his contract, I bet.  Yeah.  I would assume.  So.  Well, when you assume. 
[00:33:30]  And Billy Crystal was on the show.  What did he do?  Does anyone know?  Jay Leno.  Booty apple booba.  What did Billy Crystal do on Leno's final show?  Must have been hilarious.  Yeah, believe it or not, he did a comic music number.  No.  Do we have that?  Yeah.  Can you get back over there?  Sal's way too anxious.  Wow.  Is he nervous?  He's extremely nervous.  We actually, because Jay was crying, so we went with the bit. 
[00:34:00]  I wonder where he's from.  Sal grabs the mic to give us the answer.  And we're like, no, that's not what we're doing.  Oh, the clip plays about Dayton, Ohio, but he's ready to actually tell us where.  No, I dreamt, he's dreamt, they come from.  Because then we'd be like, Sal, it was great when you, you know, thanks for the info.  Thanks for the actual answer.  That means nothing to anyone.  Poor Sal.  Thanks for the facts.  It's like he doesn't even know the show.  I'm liking Sal. 
[00:34:30]  Sal's turned his shit around big time after all the yelling and screaming.  He's making a comeback, that's for sure.  He turned around.  I could tell because I'm not completely disgusted when I see him in the hall.  No, he's.  I'm all of a sudden going like, oh, it's Sal, not like, oh, this fucking guy.  He heard us loud and clear.  And decided not to be a slacker like most of his generation.  Yes.  True.  So is this the Billy Crystal number?  Yeah, and like a whole bunch of celebrities joined him.  Oprah was involved.  Oh, I saw it.  A lot of celebs. 
[00:35:00]  Come and see this.  Whispering, they made me stay upstairs.  You have something planned.  What do you have?  Well, you know, the first time when you left, we were here for the first show.  Sure.  With the brilliant Mark Shaman on piano, right over there.  Mark, Mark Shaman.  Oh, yeah.  Hello, Mark.  I haven't seen him in 20 years.  In 20 years.  Are you going to do another tribute?  So Mark and I got together last week.  We said we have to put something else very special for you.  Very special.  So can we do that?  Mr. Mark Shaman on piano.  I'll sit over here. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, sit right here.  I'll sit right here.  Sit right there.  All right.  So now, please say hello, ladies and gentlemen, to the Shut Your Van Trapp family singer.  Shut Your Van Trapp.  All right.  There's a sad sort of clanging from the clock in the hall, and the bells in the steeple, too.  What is he doing?  And all the executives that run NBC are popping in to say you're through. 
[00:36:00]  You're through.  You're through.  You're through.  You're through.  Regretfully, they tell me, but firmly, they compel me to say goodbye to you.  Ladies and gentlemen, Jack Black.  I'll be listening, my dear.  If Valentine's, you'll be back here next year. 
[00:36:30]  Ladies and gentlemen, Kim Kardashian.  Oh, no.  So long, farewell.  Last night I told my folks, now I won't be the butt of Leno's jokes.  Oh, get her?  Yeah, I get her.  But, yes.  She looks pretty hot, though, to be honest with you.  So long, farewell.  You've won a late night race, but I don't care. 
[00:37:00]  The Cliffs are in first place.  All black people can't sing.  Ladies and gentlemen, Sheryl Crow.  What?  Boy, they're just digging everybody up here.  It's like a super show.  She hasn't aged.  So long, farewell.  I give a little wave, but not for Shay.  I want to get on tape.  Oh, boy. 
[00:37:30]  Ladies and gentlemen, Jim Parsons.  Oh, Jim Parsons.  Oh, that guy.  Right.  The gay guy from...  Your great success is called the Big Jim Theory.  From the show that sucks.  That everyone watches?  Yes.  Big Bang?  Big Bang Theory.  The one and only, Carol Burnett.  Carol Burnett.  What?  Wow.  Holding her ear and everything.  That doesn't get a hold.  Ha, ha, ha. 
[00:38:00]  So long, farewell.  I'm here.  So what the hell?  For your last show.  I'll do the Tarzan yell.  Oh!  Oh, no.  She didn't hold it too long.  No.  She's fucking...  She's 80.  A million years old.  Right.  Ladies and gentlemen, Oprah Winfrey.  What?  Wow, man.  What if Eric Logan's with her?  This show was really big. 
[00:38:30]  If you were me, you'd buy them all a car.  I like that.  See, because that's what you used to do.  Remember?  Yeah.  Oh, is this just droning and plodding?  And the sunset, now we'll see jaywalking. 
[00:39:00]  Goodbye.  Get it, jaywalking.  Right.  Goodbye.  Look at Jack Black's laying on the desk.  He's wild.  He's crazy, isn't he?  Look out.  You don't know what he's going to do.  That wasn't bad.  What, are we going to hate on everything?  That wasn't that bad.  I'm going to hate on it.  I didn't like it at all.  You didn't like it at all? 
[00:39:30]  I don't know.  I don't know.  I think you want your late night host to look really old when he says goodbye.  Yeah.  That's what we were talking about earlier.  He's a little too young, man.  He still is.  He could have done, I would say, at least five more.  Yeah.  At least.  Before it really started.  He's a young 63, man.  Yeah.  You know, like you said before the show, Johnny looked a bit on the old side the last couple  of years.  Well, yeah, he was kind of falling off a little.  It was pretty obvious it was time for him to go, but this doesn't sit well. 
[00:40:00]  It doesn't seem like Jay is ready to go.  Yeah.  That takes nothing away from Fallon, because I understand why they have to make the move  now.  I was thinking how creepy it is to think of Jimmy Fallon in 30 years, like old and gray  and maybe a little bald, giving his farewell show.  That's what happens.  And they play clips of what we're watching now, you know, like young Jimmy Fallon.  Right.  But that time comes and it's fucking, I heard Jimmy Fallon, and the audience has just been 
[00:40:30]  one final thank you, don't.  We'll be here.  Where?  Oh, wait.  Where's Jimmy Fallon from?  Have fun with the new Opie.  I will not be here.  Fuck that.  The new.  Maybe we'll have animatronic bodies that we'll put our brains in.  Oh, how great would that be?  It'd be fantastic.  Sit back and have the new Opie and Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  See, we should just brand this shit.  Yeah, let people franchise it.  You know, the first guy that made the McDonald's hamburger, he's long gone, but they still have 
[00:41:00]  hamburgers, right?  Lives on.  That's right.  Let's do it, man.  Oh, boy.  We hired some young guns with the same type of fucking attitude.  Young whippersnappers.  Hate.  Hate.  Disdain.  Disdain.  Sarcasm.  We could find a couple of those guys.  Jaded.  Pension for self-destruction.  Well, there you go.  Not so much these days.  Well, the younger version has to go through that.  Do you know how crazy it is we've been at one place for 10 years? 
[00:41:30]  That's crazy.  That's insane.  Yeah.  Even before Anthony, I never made it to three years at any place.  And then with Anthony, we made it to three years.  It was basically, you know.  That was the limit.  I always knew you had to blow it up after three years.  That was like a perfect timing thing.  It was perfect.  But we're here 10 years.  We should have been at three different places by now.  Jeez.  Well, yeah, and it's almost time because you did like about three years in the really nice 57th Street studio. 
[00:42:00]  Mm-hmm.  And you got booted out of there and put into this place.  Yeah.  We've done, I think, four at least here at this point.  I think so, too.  Oh, wait.  If we've been doing 10, we've been here five years at least?  Mm-hmm.  We couldn't have been here five years.  In this shitty room?  We've been here five years in this shitty room?  Definitely.  If that's true, I'm going to be very depressed all week.  A little tiny studio.  Yeah, it's going to be five years in April.  That's what I thought.  God damn it.  Yeah, I knew it was around April.  Yeah.  All right, Danny, we're going to take our first break.  Oh, Danny.  And by the way.  Yeah? 
[00:42:30]  Yes.  I appreciate you taking your first break.  Oh, a little late.  I'm sorry.  We're off schedule.  I see we're off schedule already.  We were supposed to have a chat with Lady Diana Marion at 715.  Who was it that said, every good battle plan ends at first contact?  Mm-hmm.  So, you know, a general or some, you know.  But it's true.  Yeah.  It's true.  You have your plan, and then you contact, and now you've got to improvise.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Well, I know we're doing the Super Show, but there's other things, you know.  Oh.  There's shower cams in Sochi. 
[00:43:00]  I love that.  We've got to talk about the shower cams in Sochi.  Yes.  We've got to talk about Bob Costas and his pink eye, which was trending yesterday on Twitter.  His love for the words Pussy Riot.  And he loves saying Pussy on NBC.  Pussy Riot.  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to continue with something.  But first, I believe we're going back to Denny, right, who's DJing the party today.  You know, it was 50 years ago today.  JFK at 1 o'clock Eastern Time when four crazy lads arrive from Liverpool to take over America. 
[00:43:30]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Beatles.  Love, love me too.  You know I love you.  I'll always be true.  The ONA Radio Gem.  Yeah, this is going to be the showstopper today.  Everyone knows what Twato is by now.  It's genital herpes, Anthony.  Yes.  It is it.  Yeah.  Well, that's what we...  Diagnosed by three doctors, my friend.  Okay, hold it.  Mouth cancer was also diagnosed on a guy. 
[00:44:00]  Right.  And it turned out to be nothing.  Man, if this isn't a match made in heaven.  Look at these two.  Very cute.  Yeah, you like them?  Very cute.  You like him, Sandy?  Are you Irish?  Yes.  Are you well-entailed?  No.  You have a nice tongue, I bet.  Not too big.  Not too well.  We don't have to give Sandy the mic anymore because she doesn't say anything worth saying  ever.  All right, look.  We're running out of time.  Sandy, take those off.  I am literally a foot away.  Come on.  She painted Twato today to match her yellow tights. 
[00:44:30]  It's yellow.  Right yellow.  All right, Paulo, if you would please get to know the lovely Twato.  Here I go.  Oh, hey, here we go.  All right, he's going in and he's going.  Here we go.  Very wide mouth.  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  He's got it!  He's nibbling!  Oh, oh!  Oh, that is the most disgusting thing ever!  He chipped the paint!  He chipped the paint, Antoine!  You want more? 
[00:45:00]  No, she's asking me to bite it off.  No!  God damn it!  Bite it!  Bite it!  Just flick it!  Flick it!  Oh, God!  He's got his teeth in there!  Oh, God!  I'm going to vomit!  Oh, he's tugging!  He's tugging!  Oh, my!  Oh, my!  Oh, my!  Oh, no!  Oh, God!  He's doing it more!  That's unsolicited!  Okay, okay!  Enough!  Ronnie?  Yeah?  We could top the Twato thing because... 
[00:45:30]  No.  No.  Twato has friends around back.  I don't know what it can work out here, but...  Paul?  I dare you!  Yeah.  You want him to go around back?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, Paul, would you...  Listen.  Sandy Kane.  All right.  Just go over.  Go ahead.  Drop.  All right.  Hold on.  Drop.  Oh, my God.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Oh, my God.  He's going around back.  He's going around back.  Wait, wait.  Paul, will you come around?  This is the most disgusting sight I've ever seen in my life. 
[00:46:00]  Look, I've got to get over there.  And you've got to take a look at this.  Paul, you've got to get in deep.  Right?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, well...  Oh, God!  It's green.  Apparently, it's green.  It's green.  It's green.  Paul.  Yeah, go ahead.  Paul, come on.  I'll start with the nose.  It's pissing.  Paul.  Paul.  Paul.  Paul.  Oh, my God.  His nose is in there. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, my God.  You're insane.  Go ahead, Paul.  Oh, my God.  The nose is very deep.  There it goes.  Get the mouth in there, Paul.  I cannot even tell you.  Oh, God.  Wow.  I just poured bleach into my eyes.  And I'm feeling better.  Sandy, what the hell is going on?  You ever heard of a depilatory or something?  What?  What do you use?  A depilatory?  It's hairy and awful.  It's a big, hairy mess. 
[00:47:00]  I've never seen a green one.  It was green.  It looked like a Venus flytrap.  It looked pretty good to me.  Who's that old guy over there?  Uncle Paul.  Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy staring.  Uncle Paul.  Now he's coming over here, slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now, because here comes Uncle Paul.  Make sure you had to make a big boy love you.  In today's episode, Uncle Paul writes a poem. 
[00:47:30]  You're like my sunshine.  You're like a can of warm sardine oil pouring down my throat.  You're like salve.  I rub on my privates when they're all shaved from running around.  I want to be your preparation, H.  Always getting in there and making you feel better.  My tongue is your toilet paper.  Who's that old guy over there? 
[00:48:00]  Uncle Paul.  Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy staring.  Uncle Paul.  Now he's coming over here, slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now, because here comes Uncle Paul.  We got freaks, we got idiots, and monstrosities about it.  We're back with the O&A Super Show.  Lots going on in the month of February.  Also, lest we forget that it's Black History Month.  That's right. 
[00:48:30]  Here on the Super Show.  Lest week.  Friday morning.  I don't remember this.  I don't know this one.  1973 hit music from Mano de Bango.  I really don't know this one.  I don't remember that.  You know this one?  Yeah, it was kind of used in a couple of movies.  A lot of hip-hop artists use this to sample.  Really?  Well, thanks, Denny.  Denny is live DJing for us.  Yes, for the Super Show.  And we got breaking news for real. 
[00:49:00]  Oh.  Scott Shannon, who we have beat the shit out of over the years, is retiring.  Oh, he's retiring from radio.  And he didn't tell anyone.  He just went cold with it this morning, saying today is his last show.  My last show.  He's not even saying, like, I'm going to quit in spring.  Of course, he's the guy that, you know, I want to see the boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie.  It's like a battery car.  Right.  It's like a battery car.  I got a tree on my house. 
[00:49:30]  I got a tree on my house.  I want to see the boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie.  That is huge news in radio.  Oh, my God.  Huge.  And boy, is the New York Radio Message Board going to have fun with that one.  Just a light.  And you know what?  Believe it or not, this is where I always turn.  Yeah.  I wish him nothing but the best.  Ah, now that he's out of the business.  No.  Well.  We had our fun with the guy.  Of course.  The fact is, he made his mark in this business.  Now, that's an odd thing to do.  I would love to know why he's doing this cold like this. 
[00:50:00]  Because usually, someone like him, I mean, I don't think me and you will ever get an actual farewell or goodbye.  No.  I just don't believe that will ever happen to us.  I never believe that would happen to us.  No.  It's just going to be just some ugly thing that ends this.  We both know that.  That's always the way.  We're not going to have a farewell show like Jay Leno.  We're just not.  I know it.  But someone like Scott, he would like to just say, hey, end of the year, I'm retiring. 
[00:50:30]  Right.  And have a big ramp up to his retirement.  So, for it to come out of nowhere like this, what is that about?  Out of the fucking blue.  What's that about?  It's weird.  It's very odd that he just picks today.  And he said, I didn't tell anyone.  Probably not even Todd.  I don't know.  He probably told Todd.  He didn't tell Todd.  But supposedly he didn't tell anyone.  He didn't tell anyone over there at PLJ.  He didn't tell David Hinckley, I think he said. 
[00:51:00]  I didn't even tell him who writes about radio.  So, that's breaking news.  Which is nothing but the best, for real.  For real.  That brings up a bunch of speculation, I'm sure.  Sure.  About probably health reasons.  A lot of people will think maybe it was for health reasons.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know.  It just seems...  Yeah, Danny, you're going to have to figure out a song for Scott Shannon, all right?  Oh.  He'll come up with something for him. 
[00:51:30]  He gave New York many, many, many years of radio.  How many years was he on in New York?  He came back.  He came in 1983, the first time.  He knows!  He went on the air in the summer of 83.  That's 31 years ago.  And then he left to go out to California for...  That's Mojo Radio.  Mojo Radio.  That's what you call Mojo Radio.  Yeah.  So.  All right.  Where's Lady Di and Marion?  Oh, we've got to get them in here, right?  We've got to start a super show, officially.  I guess Lady Di was primping or putting on her makeup or something. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  Getting all gussied up.  Oh, and a show on Instagram has a picture that I retweeted.  You can go to my Twitter, OP Radio.  You can go to Anthony's Twitter, Anthony Cumia.  Not safe for breakfast?  Huh?  Is that a not safe for breakfast picture?  Because...  It's rough, man.  It looks like she's putting on eyeliner.  Why is she bothering with eyeliner?  Oh, no.  But I just retweeted it from the Oh and a show Instagram. 
[00:52:30]  Lady Di putting on eye makeup, getting ready for the super show.  Yuck.  All right.  This is going to be exhausting.  And here they come, walking down the hall.  Look at the...  Oh, God.  The retarded Laverne and Shirley.  How about we dedicate this one to Lady Di?  Oh, wow.  Little George Thorogood.  And I drink alone.  Oh, that's a good one.  Not sure if we have a supply of natty ice in here.  Oh, that would be nice if we did, huh?  There she comes. 
[00:53:00]  They're making their entrance.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I like it with the music.  Here they are.  Good morning.  Just exhausting.  Where do I sit?  Movies on the Mind is your t-shirt today.  Nesmith.  Hey, man.  That's all right, guys.  All right, Marion.  That's good.  Marion's real good.  Marion.  Marion, how's the shits?  I'm good.  I'm good.  We heard you had one of those shitty bellies.  Yeah, I got a two-day virus.  So why?  Oh, yeah?  How was the two-day virus? 
[00:53:30]  I'm good.  I'm ready for cruising.  All right.  Sunday morning, man.  Right in Bayonne, I'm going to be the first one on the ship.  Oh, you're leaving out of Bayonne?  Yeah.  You're going on the SS shit your pants?  Yes.  That one?  I wouldn't call it that, but I'm going on.  Well, no.  That's my ship.  Talk into the microphone, please.  That's my ship.  Hey, guys.  What, the Explorer?  Yep.  That's my ship, man.  Oh, wow.  You're going on it.  And where are you going?  Florida and the Bahamas.  I'm going to be Tuesday's my birthday.  Right.  So I'll be in Florida.  Right.  And then from Florida, go to Bahamas. 
[00:54:00]  Right.  From Bahamas, go on to Coco Cay.  Right.  And then back home.  Wonderful.  All right.  I envy her.  And I got another one booked for June.  Uh-huh.  Really?  Yeah, I'm paying that one now.  Wow, look at you.  Just cruising.  Twice a year.  Me and my husband.  Twice a year.  Oh, yeah.  So what's up with the stomach flu?  The stomach virus?  I'm good.  How bad was it?  Were you shitting water?  No, no.  I'm good.  I'm good.  Yeah.  Do you have a tummy ache?  Yeah, that's it.  That's it.  I'm fine.  And you almost didn't make it today.  We almost had a cast in the Super Shop.  No, no.  You know why?  No, I wasn't going to come because of the weather, because of the snow. 
[00:54:30]  And she had the pain in the ass.  Right.  Who, Lady Di?  Yeah, Lady Di.  So I'm like, I don't know whether I was coming or not.  Right.  So I decided yesterday, what the hell, let me go.  Right.  This is shattered hell up.  Sure.  And the Super Show, we were going to cancel if you weren't here, because obviously this  is your show, Mary.  No, we talked it over.  Oh, my God.  I said, I'm cold.  All right.  We talked what over?  I didn't know how clear it is.  I don't want to look around.  We talked it over.  I was coming to the show today.  Oh, my God.  I'm already exhausted. 
[00:55:00]  I don't want to walk around.  We love you guys.  You know it.  I don't know how clear the streets were around here.  You know, that's why.  They're always clear.  They're always clear.  But, Mary, you do understand that you are the star of the Super Show, right?  Yeah.  Not really, no.  Without you, there is no Super Show.  No, you got Diane.  Diane does good by herself.  She's all right.  She was here in December by herself.  Yeah, she's all right.  But without you, forget it.  Yeah, yeah.  Forget it.  No.  Don't say that.  Look at her.  Her hair's all messed up.  Oh, will you stop with my hair?  I kept telling you.  Calm your hair.  She got even more boarded. 
[00:55:30]  Yes.  You look.  God, I did comb my hair.  It's just that it gets messed up like that.  You're right.  You're seeing a lot of bloat there.  That's not a good thing.  We're sitting there watching TV.  The ass has got to go.  Lady Di, put your hand out like this.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  We've got to get you a natty ice shake.  You're jonesing.  Go ahead.  Get me a natty ice then.  I had coffee a little while ago.  Ice coffee.  Everyone's shaking with their coffee story.  What the fuck?  Is coffee giving you Parkinson's?  Don't look at me.  What?  I had one coffee.  I'm the one that gets nervous. 
[00:56:00]  I'm the one that has...  You're not nervous.  You're jonesing for alcohol.  You're having...  Did you have any alcohol on the way in?  No.  No.  Nope.  No.  You wouldn't let her have alcohol on the way in?  And I told her this morning when I got up and I called her.  Yeah.  I told her, she ain't getting in my husband's car smelling like alcohol.  Oh, shit.  Or she's going to walk to the train station.  Right.  Right on.  No, that is true.  So, my husband picked her up and took us to the train station.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Are you worried about her?  Mary.  Yes, I am.  She's drinking a lot of natty ices. 
[00:56:30]  A lot.  Early in the morning.  I know.  And smoking.  I know.  And she's got bed bugs.  Oh, no.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I don't have them.  I don't have them.  She doesn't have them no more.  I don't have them anymore.  We took care of that problem.  I really wish people would stop saying that.  Well, you said it.  Listen to me.  You're the one that called them up last week.  Yes.  And told them.  I didn't.  You don't look.  You're the one that you put your foot right in your frigging mouth, Diana.  Come on.  Everything goes in her mouth.  Anyway.  Yes.  Obviously.  Anyway.  You called. 
[00:57:00]  I mean, why?  Because you had nothing to do that day.  Nothing on TV.  So, you figured.  Let me call up Ian Anthony.  Not just to say hi.  I got bed bugs.  I didn't show it like that.  I hollered at you for calling them and telling them you had bed bugs.  I felt like I'm not getting the crap out of you.  I said, what the hell are you doing that for?  Yeah, she did.  She called me up.  She goes, what did you tell them that for?  Because I heard it.  I heard the replay.  Yeah.  You're finally listening to the show after all these years.  Well, I do listen to it.  You finally figured out the satellite.  But I miss my MIFI.  But they don't make them no more.  The MIFI.  MIFI.  Yeah, what, 10 years ago?  I miss my Victrola. 
[00:57:30]  Right.  That's like saying that.  Wow.  I miss my record player.  I do.  I really do.  Colin would be laughing his ass off right now.  When I come home from work, I do listen to you guys.  Thank you, Mary.  And when I'm riding around in the car, I do listen.  So you hear when Lady Di calls in and...  Yeah, I listen to her at the replay.  Oh, boy.  And when she pulled me up at work and told me what she did, I said to her, what the fuck  is wrong with you?  I started hollering at her because...  Right.  Yes, yes.  I said, don't be telling everybody that you have this and you have that. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  A lot of people have that problem.  Okay.  All right.  We got the message.  All right.  Whoa.  Diana, didn't I holler at you?  Because even Bill hollered at you for doing it.  Yeah, I know.  Bill called me up and said, if you don't believe what the hell she did.  Oh, Bill called.  Let me ask Lady Di something.  Marion, obviously, very critical of you and your lifestyle.  Is there something about Marion that bothers you?  No.  She's perfect.  She's all right.  All right?  Yeah.  She's fine with me. 
[00:58:30]  I don't, you know.  No.  Nothing really bothers me.  Is there something she does that bothers you?  Not really, no.  Well, not really means something.  One thing.  What is it?  Diana, if there's one thing that bothers you about me is because probably is.  Wait, wait.  Hold on a second.  She always comes to the point.  She always speaks her mind.  I always tell the truth.  Right.  Right.  And I want her to slow.  I want her to slow down on what she's doing.  All right.  You mean the drinking and stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So this is why I come to somebody else. 
[00:59:00]  I tried.  Are you scratching your vagina?  Are you just scratching your vagina?  Why is she scratching her vagina, Marion?  I saw her put her hand up.  I don't know.  Why do you have an itchy vagina?  I wasn't doing that.  I think she's scratching her vagina.  I don't know what she's got.  I said I want to lose some of her.  Before you did that.  I don't live with her and I don't live next door from her.  So I don't know.  Have you been in her house?  Not in a while.  Not since December.  What's the problem with her house?  No, nothing.  We don't live that close that I can go over there and hang out. 
[00:59:30]  Is the house disgusting?  I'm not messy.  I'm far from it.  It's okay?  It's good.  Yeah.  Is it good?  Yeah.  It's good.  Her boyfriend cleans a lot.  Bill's a good guy.  Would you like to come over?  Is that her boyfriend?  No, it's not my boyfriend.  I would say you and Bill have been together for a very long time.  But they're not boyfriend, boyfriend, girlfriend, boyfriend.  But he's good.  He's good to her.  Yeah, he is.  He's very good to Diana.  Do they have sex?  I don't know.  That's not my business. 
[01:00:00]  Well, you said boyfriend.  I would assume that means sex.  If they do, they do.  They do, they do.  Do you guys have sex?  Do you have sex with your wife?  Which I know you do.  You have two kids.  Well, yeah, of course I do.  Do you have sex with your girlfriend, Anthony?  But sure.  But we're asking about her.  I know.  Because her living arrangement's a little strange.  Why?  Because she's living with a guy.  She says they're just, I don't know, fucking roommates or something.  We are.  We're just roommates.  But he's good to her. 
[01:00:30]  He really is.  You don't put his dick in your mouth ever?  Oh.  No.  Ding.  Ring the bell.  Ring the bell.  Ding.  No, that's not why we ring the bell.  I'd like to call out Marion.  Every time I say no, we ring the bell.  Wow.  Hold on.  Who's this guy?  I'd like to call out Marion.  Yeah.  Oh, he's a DJ.  She's.  Oh.  She's.  I don't know him.  Not really.  We talk about her honesty and getting to the point.  Yeah.  She's kind of glossing over this whole Lady Di thing about the house and everything.  Right.  If I may read.  Our house is nice, too.  Some messages that I received from Marion. 
[01:01:00]  Sure.  Hi, Anthony.  Diane is disgusting.  Uh-uh.  She didn't write that.  I really answered that.  With her bed bugs.  She is a solo, uh, a slob.  Marion did not write that.  She is a slob.  She does not clean.  I'm glad I don't live by her.  Yuck.  How gross.  Hope to see you soon.  Whoa.  Uh, Marion?  Yeah.  Comment?  I wrote that because I got tired of her calling you about the bed bugs.  She did write that.  I did write that because I got tired of you calling about the bed bugs. 
[01:01:30]  Oh.  Because Lady Di said she didn't write that.  All right.  I got mad at her.  She called you.  I got mad when she called you and said that about that.  A slob.  She does not clean.  Now, when you said the house is clean.  Bill cleans.  Bill cleans most of the time.  Oh.  Bill cleans.  You have a comment, Lady Di?  Marion's calling you out.  I clean.  If I see something dirty, I'll clean it.  But Bill does most of the cleaning.  But Bill, yeah, he does a lot of the work.  Yeah. 
[01:02:00]  But they have a small apartment.  What about her calling you a slob?  I said to her, I said, Diana, you say she's got a small apartment.  Whatever.  Whatever.  Well, it doesn't end there.  It's not true.  Oh, it doesn't end there.  No.  Here's the second message I got from Marion.  Hey, Anthony and Opie, I just want to ask you for a favor.  Instead of making fun of Diane and her lifestyle, please get her help.  Try to help her with alcohol and try to help with a job.  I am tired of hearing it. 
[01:02:30]  And Bill is mad that she told you guys about the bed bugs and she took care of that problem.  I will talk to you Friday.  Okay, so you're saying that we should help her?  Yeah, I mean, she tells me she goes to these jobs.  We should have an intervention, right?  I'm going to tell you something right now.  And she's standing right here.  Well, yes, she is.  And I don't care.  I've been telling her to go to Jersey Gardens Mall because they have a training center there.  And they will train you.  That sounds horrendous.  I know, right?  No, no.  They will train you.  A training center.  They will train you.  I'll go sometime this week. 
[01:03:00]  One of those sticks that they tap behind her ears.  No, they do.  They have a thing there at the mall where they train people to work in the mall.  To do care-shearing, to do whatever.  I will.  No, you won't.  And when a seal does what it's supposed to do, they give it fish.  A fish.  They can give Lady Di some natty ice.  A few natty ice.  When she goes, uh, here comes the things on the internet.  I've been telling her for months.  Yes.  Yeah.  We've been telling her for years. 
[01:03:30]  And let me tell you, I walk the mall every day.  And I know.  It's obvious.  It's obvious, by the way.  Shake that ass.  Show us.  You are shaped up.  Give us a twist, man.  You look good.  Look at that.  Remember?  The old days, you were a little heavier.  It's the cruising.  You know?  It's the dancing.  Oh, you're right.  It's the gym.  Feeling hot, hot, hot.  It's the Zumba.  It's the Zumba.  You're looking all right.  Wow.  You're jazzercising or something.  I just used to be tired of me.  Now it fits me.  Let's get physical.  Nice.  Right?  And then Lady Di, obviously, you are not exercising. 
[01:04:00]  Not really, no.  You got a trucker's belly.  You don't.  Whatever.  Yeah.  Not whatever.  I bet it.  Yeah.  50.  Get a NutriBullet or something.  NutriBull?  A NutriBullet.  NutriBullet.  You know, vegetables and fruits.  Okay.  You should try a different kind of bullet.  Perhaps.  Yeah.  I tell her to walk around a block a couple.  A couple times.  I do that.  I walk a lot.  Believe it or not.  You know what?  I'm going to tell you something. 
[01:04:30]  And I don't want to insult her.  But you know, when you get older, everything just like.  Starts.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  And I tell her, Diana, you got to try to do something.  Because when you're 52, 53, 54, everything just like.  Your metabolism slows down.  You start saying gravity takes its toll.  And I tell her, you got to start.  You know, even if she had hand weights at home, it's that there and did this.  Picture that.  No, I have them.  I do have hand weights at home. 
[01:05:00]  And do this.  It's obvious, Marion.  Yeah, two nanny ices.  One in each hand.  That's your weights.  I have five pounds.  Yeah.  Five pounds.  But you're looking good.  Look at your body because you're using the hand weights.  I know.  Very sexy.  Amazing.  I even tell her, join the gym with me.  Because Lucille Roberts is like five dollars.  I can't afford the gym.  It's like five dollars a month, Diane.  That's it.  Marion, by the way, I'm sorry about the nigger thing.  Oh, wow.  What?  What happened?  Oh, shit.  She's waving you off.  She's waving you off.  Don't say that.  Don't say that.  I'm sorry about that.  That was just. 
[01:05:30]  You cool with it?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Shut her off.  She's cool with it.  Play some music.  That never.  What?  Don't take us to break.  Marion, it shut her down.  Oh, it shut her right down.  All I want to say is that you got a pass, though, from the DJ Who kid.  Yeah, you got a pass.  You're good.  You got the card.  You got the, you know, use it any time you want card.  DJ Who kid, he cans those things out.  Where is Who kid anyway?  Why did it shut her down? 
[01:06:00]  She's like, mm-hmm.  Wow, we figured out how to get her quiet.  Ixnay on the Iggernay.  Don't want to talk about it?  You look mad.  What?  What happened?  I just want to apologize.  That was Pig Latin, by the way, or as I call it, Dilatin.  I don't want to talk about it, guys, please.  What?  I don't want to talk about it.  Oh, shit.  I don't want to talk about it.  Did it, did it, was it trouble?  I bet it was probably trouble, right?  I won't talk about it.  I won't talk about it, but I'm just, I'm just asking you one thing.  Was it, was it trouble? 
[01:06:30]  Did you get a talking?  Did you get a talking to?  It wasn't about being a racist.  You're not a racist.  I know it wasn't.  We know you're not.  But there were people that looked at it and thought, you know, thought you were a racist.  What?  The what?  Yeah.  But everyone knows you're not a racist.  But everyone, everyone pulls that race card out of their ass.  Right.  You were just having fun.  And DJ Who Kid said it was cool.  DJ Who Kid was in the video.  If a black guy says it's cool, then you're a lot of safe.  It's fine, then it's fine.  We all know that.  What?  What?  I don't know.  We're a lot of...  Oh, she works with a lot of... 
[01:07:00]  Yeah, but they should understand the culture.  Marion, we know you hate those people, but it's okay.  All right.  Anthony.  What happened?  Nobody hates anybody.  Oh, well.  Well, we hate you.  We're past.  I just want to apologize.  Because I knew it caused problems.  I know.  All right.  We'll let it go.  All right.  All right.  Anyway.  Oh, there it is.  There's the video.  Well, maybe we're sharing.  Oh, shit.  She just smacked you.  Wow.  That's not the video.  Sam just got smacked.  Come on, Sam. 
[01:07:30]  That's not even it.  That's not the video.  That's when you were twerking in the elevator with DJ Who Kid and Lady God.  A little twerking.  A little twerking.  I might have to retweet the worst twerking video ever.  Oh, God.  Was that a bad fucking twerking?  All right.  We're past that.  We're all past that.  I just felt like I owed you an apology.  That's all I'm saying.  That's very nice of you.  We forced you to say that.  All right.  It's okay.  Let's just go.  Okay.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  Okay.  On to something else.  All right.  On to something else. 
[01:08:00]  We can go back to how bloated Lady God is.  My ass is fatter that day.  You're looking.  Oh.  I looked at that too.  You're in ship shape now.  Ready for the boat.  My ass is fat.  My ass is fat.  Let me tell you.  I am ready to start dancing.  Yeah.  Very good.  I've been dancing.  Okay.  Yes.  Lady Di?  You're going to get Rich Fawson here?  Yeah.  Eventually.  Okay.  What happened to Colin Quinn?  He, well, I don't know if we should tell you.  What happened to Jimmy?  Go ahead.  You can see him.  I know Jimmy's in D.C.  Colin was in a bad car accident. 
[01:08:30]  Oh, Jesus.  No, he wasn't.  No, he was not.  He was not.  I don't believe what you want to believe.  He was not.  He's going to be all right, but he's not going to be around for a while.  What happened?  It rained.  Well, what do you think?  Did you see the roads?  They're icy.  Black ice.  But I thought, Diane tells me he was going to Colorado.  He was, yeah.  That's when it happened.  Well, on his way to Colorado.  On the way to the airport?  On the way to the airport, yes.  I hope he's all right, though.  He was flying out yesterday when the ice was really bad. 
[01:09:00]  He's going to be all right, but he's got a long road of recovery ahead of him.  Did he get hurt?  Yeah, he got fucking hurt.  What happened?  A few busted ribs, a punctured lung.  No, don't say that.  Lacerations on his face.  No, come on.  Don't say that.  I was hoping he'd be here, at least a phone call or something.  He was attempting to cancel the Colorado gig.  Huh?  Yep.  Is that true about Colorado?  Is that true?  Lady Ty.  No, he's not saying nothing.  He don't want to say nothing.  It's true, but let's chill about it, all right?  You want to talk about it?  Colin, I hope you're okay. 
[01:09:30]  You're on the radio talking about it.  It's not talking about it.  I'm not talking about it anymore.  I just want to tell you that's what he's here.  Let's just chill about it.  I hope he's okay.  I hope he's going to be okay, Colin.  Quick recovery.  I love you.  All right.  Yeah, I'm going to tweet him later on.  He's not in any shape to...  He's in a hospital, right?  What hospital?  I don't know.  So many jerseys.  I don't know the jersey hospitals.  He was on his way to Newark Airport, though, so whatever's close to there.  What?  Trenitas.  Maybe Trenitas.  Oh, I don't know. 
[01:10:00]  Oh, God.  No, she's just naming the hospital.  Trenitas.  Danny, can you pick up the mood in here, and we're going to get Rich Voss.  Trenitas.  Sure, we'll get something on for you today.  Let's see.  We'll get this...  You guys were dancing before?  Huh?  How about a song that was real popular last week at the Grammys?  Oh, I love this song.  Yeah, I know.  A little dance music for you this morning.  Oh, yeah.  As we hope everybody has a great weekend.  Oh, I do.  And maybe tomorrow night, Saturday night, Friday night, you will get lucky.  Oh, yeah.  I'll be getting lucky on Sunday through next Sunday. 
[01:10:30]  She just keeps yelling.  She keeps yelling.  Come on, Diane, I want to show you some dancing moves.  Oh, please.  Have you guys ever rubbed your pussies together?  No.  The honey boners, the mambo.  No.  What?  No.  What?  Why are you getting mad at that?  I don't go that way.  But girls do that.  Because it's just a thing to do.  Not me.  It ain't a thing for me to do.  Ah.  You guys want to rub your pussies together?  No.  No. 
[01:11:00]  Do you want to rub together with her?  No.  Do you want to rub together with her?  No, but that's not the point.  Neither do I.  No.  No, we talked about this on the radio.  Sam, you want to rub together with her?  I don't either.  What about you, DJ?  No, it's about the girls.  Yo.  You guys are the stars today.  Hey.  What's this in the game?  DJ from who?  Danny.  That's Danny.  Danny?  They just asked Danny if he wants to rub against Lady Di's vagina.  He goes, no.  You guys are the stars today. 
[01:11:30]  There's a good way out of it there, Danny.  But Mario, you don't do that, you know?  I don't go that way.  Girls are known to do that.  Not me.  It's just cool.  It's not even that you're lesbians or anything.  Who do you know that?  I guess we're not cool then.  You guys are high school old high school friends.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Probably got drunk.  No, no.  We went to different high schools.  Yeah, but that doesn't matter on the weekend.  You have a few beers.  Next thing you know, you're having a sleepover.  You're finger-popping each other because no one's around. 
[01:12:00]  And then, like, Monday comes and it's all cool.  It's all fine.  Hey, what about you, Opie?  Ever rub your dick against somebody?  It's different for girls and guys.  Girls do that stuff.  Ever rub it against a guy?  No, but that's the point.  Guys can't imagine doing that.  Women don't do that anymore.  A lot of women are doing it.  It's really hot right now.  I don't know anybody that's doing it.  Marion, go on the internet.  You'll see a lot of women doing that.  Well, I don't go on porn sites.  What are you looking at, Lady Di?  I don't go on porn sites, Diana.  Lady Di.  What made you stop going to porn sites, Lady Di? 
[01:12:30]  Well, let's just put it this way.  I don't like porn sites right now.  Why?  Why don't you like porn sites?  My phone is a computer.  Why don't you like porn sites right now?  I just don't like them anymore.  What happened?  Why?  What happened?  Officially dried up down there?  Yeah, what happened?  Hormonal problems?  She did, right?  Marion's saying, yes, she's dried up.  I'm not dried up.  You're a little raisin ovaries now?  Remember?  Remember?  What?  Yeah, she leaked.  Do you remember?  I leak.  I'm not dried up.  You were leaking on the last super show. 
[01:13:00]  She's got incontinence.  That's what Jimmy said.  Incontinence.  Well, what do you think it is?  I don't know.  It's called nerves.  There was some kind of discharging going on.  We don't know.  It's not nerves.  Do you want me to explain it to you?  Yeah.  Okay.  Why don't you like going on porn, Diana?  I know why I don't.  Explain it to them.  Why don't you?  I just don't.  Why?  I just don't.  Christian?  No, I just, you know, got at it.  I used to back...  But what happened?  I just stopped going on that.  I think it's kind of healthy to go to a porn site every once in a while.  Sure.  I don't think there's anything wrong with that. 
[01:13:30]  No, I don't see anything wrong with it.  I just don't bother.  What kind of porn were you into?  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  What?  Oh.  What?  What now?  That means we're up here.  Come here.  What?  What?  What?  What?  You're a pain in the ass.  They're going into the corner.  What's the problem?  You're a pain in the fucking ass.  She's sneaking away.  Here.  Wait.  What are you leaking now?  You leaking now?  No, I'm not leaking now.  What?  Don't say anything about it.  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  If they do, they just delete it.  No, no.  Shush. 
[01:14:00]  If they do, they just delete it.  Shut up.  Wait.  I can't hear.  What was that?  Okay.  What happened?  Nothing.  Nothing happened.  Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing.  Head towards her off.  We're off the air.  What happens?  I don't know.  She's saying that she doesn't want to talk about that.  Talk about what?  Nothing.  Nothing happens at all.  She doesn't want anybody twittering.  Twittering.  No.  Porn pictures.  Porn pictures.  Yeah.  She doesn't.  Oh, okay.  Well, now we can put the word out.  No, no.  You don't want that.  There's a lot of shit she gets twittered.  I don't know anything about twitter.  We can put the word out and tell the listeners.  I don't know anything about twitter.  I don't know.  They listen to us. 
[01:14:30]  I don't have one of those phones.  Lady Di, they listen to us.  It's cool.  They do listen to us.  And if we say, look, don't.  It's Ed's on.  And I'm serious here.  I'm serious.  Do not send Lady Di any inappropriate pictures.  Right.  And I know another thing you don't like, and I don't like it either.  When they photoshop your face on things.  Oh, they always do that.  On porno pictures.  That's not cool.  So don't do that either.  Yeah, you guys are friends.  But don't send porn to Lady Di. 
[01:15:00]  All right.  I mean it when I say, don't send it, listeners, because they listen to me.  Okay.  I hate you, Anthony.  What?  It's like some of these people.  I love you, Anthony.  I'm only kidding.  They listen.  Some of these people that are friends with her.  What?  What?  Some of these people that are friends with her.  I don't know.  And they want them to be friends with me.  I'll look under my name.  Uh-huh.  And I'll be like, no, I don't know you.  All right.  We got to take a call from Pal from 90 Day Fiance.  Who the hell is that?  90 Day Fiance?  What?  That's so cool. 
[01:15:30]  She's a friend of the show now.  Well, we had her on yesterday, and she wants to thank us, I think, for all the followers  she got.  Who's the 90 Day Fiance?  It's a great show on TLC.  We're all in.  We love it.  What time is it on?  And she's a Colombian broad, and she's awesome, and a lot of people are following her on Twitter.  Sure.  She only had, like, 500 followers, and now she's over, I think, over 5,000 just because  of this radio show.  Where was she from?  Yeah.  Columbia.  Columbia.  You heard of Lady Di?  Um, no, I never heard of her before.  What?  Did you hear us talking about it, though?  I don't see.  I don't see.  He just got finished telling me. 
[01:16:00]  He's on TLC.  They're on TLC.  Uh, Pal, what's up?  You guys got me in big trouble yesterday.  Why did we get you in trouble, pal?  Because you said we were married, and TV guy wants to take my visa and send me home now.  Oh, no.  And we're making us get divorced, and if I don't find another man to marry, I have to leave  this country because of you, the Anthony and O.P. show.  Oh, no.  You need a man?  You need a man?  How about the, I date Mary Man and Lady Guy.

I could afford cruises.  Have you ever been on a cruise? 
[01:17:00]  Have you ever been on a cruise?  And you know what?  They got good comedians on a cruise.  Maybe that's why you've never been on a cruise.  Because you're not a good comedian.  You're an ass.  A-S-S.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  Something you have something big of.  Yeah, but you're not my big of fat ass, honey.  What about you?  Hey, Lady Guy, shut up, you fucking idiot.

Okay, was that really Frenchy that called yesterday?  Yes, it was.  Hey, how was he?

Oh, he's still in New York?  Oh, sure.  How come he's not doing the show?  I don't know.  What happened yesterday?  Frenchy, how come you don't come on and visit you guys anymore?  I don't know.  Maybe he lives too far.  Maybe.  Then he moved out of state, right?  He moved to California?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's at training now.  Training for what?  He had a gender reassignment.  Oh, training.  He got that gender reassignment. 
[01:19:00]  So he sounds cool on the phone still?  Well, don't answer that, Eddie.  He doesn't want anyone to see him anymore because he kind of has kids and stuff now.  What?  He's like a bi-  Gender reassignment.  No, he didn't.  I swear to God.  No, he didn't.  He didn't.  But he kept his dick.  No, he didn't.  I swear to God.  No.  It's been a long time.  He moved to California.  Yeah, well, the land of fruits and nuts, California, right?  You need to tell me he got tits now?  Or Florida.  Well, I don't know.  It was a normal year ago that he had moved out of state. 
[01:19:30]  He's more accepting in California.  Is he still a chef?  There's a name for that.  That's why he moved there.  I see it all the time.  Gina, gee, what was that meant?  Don't look at me.  I don't know.  You're the one that sits here by the computer and not on the phone all day.  No, it was on the phone four days a week.  Eight hours a day.  You work your ass off, Marion.  And she don't work.  No.  Yeah, I know.  And she's just a swath.  Stop.  She's got more time than I do to go on.  Why are you itching everything, Lady Di?  You're always itching.  You're making me itch.  You're getting nervous.

You're itching your head, your face, you're itching your arms, your vagina.  You were itching your vagina earlier.  You got like kind of nerve problems.  You need some anxiety pills.

How did you not like  August of Osage County?  Oh  I'm not a chick  But it wasn't  No, you have  No, what we  Why are we talking about that movie?  I hated it  Did you like that?  Because I grew up with an overbearing mother  Maybe I didn't want to see that shit on the big screen  It's deeper than a movie  It's not even that deep  When you were watching 
[01:37:30]  Did you get a little tear come down the line?  Mommy was mean to me  We went to see American Hustle  I'm like, do you watch  What the fuck?

Rich loves all those kind of like lady emotional movies  You like lady emotional movies?  He emotes through the movies  I thought the acting between Julia Roberts and Meryl Streep was  Meryl Streep  Meryl Streep  Okay, can I just tell you something? 
[01:38:00]  We did a show with Gary Goleman recently  Right  When we do go in the movie  And Rich said  Just ignore her  She will not  She will not shut up  We've tried  Just go  Plow right through  Like you're a fucking snow plow  Right, right  Just go  Give the fuck what's in your way  She's a Hyundai in the way  Right, exactly  You're a snow plow  Just plow right over that fucking Hyundai  Leave her in the fucking weeds on the side  So Rich and Gary, they start  Rich says, you know, it's a good movie  You know, August, Osage County 
[01:38:30]  And Gary Goleman high fives him  And they're like, it's amazing  It was the most uncomfortable moment I've ever  It'd be like if two chicks were like  Right, right  Had they discussed the movie with each other's dicks in their mouths  I know  It was like they were  Fruit  They were cuddling at one point  It was  It really is a fruity movie  Come on  That's a chick  That's a chick flick  But Rich loves those kind of movies  Like what's one of your favorite movies that  Women aren't funny  No  Oh, Joy Luck Club

He doesn't have a hard arm.  Because he was thinking about the penthouse girls.  I need a napkin also to rub that.  No, that's mean.  I can't do this to him.  It's too late.  It's too late.  You set the ball in motion.  Right.  Once the roller coaster goes tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, up to the top, you can't stop.  And Rich, that means you've got to look.  You've got to look. 
[02:03:30]  He's fucking a jelly donut.  Fucking a jelly donut.  Oh, Bonnie, don't worry.  I can't.  It's the only life he has.  I'm Canadian.  There is no God.  This is one of the shows we're going to go home feeling bad about ourselves.  I feel bad.  You feel bad now.  Hey, this is your bit.  There is no God.  We're just wiping the jelly off his penis.  We didn't have that bit scheduled.  Look, I have to stop exploiting people.  That's fine.  Of course.  Yeah, I mean.  What happened to Marion? 
[02:04:00]  Why'd she leave?  Can I throw this out?  He almost handed it to fucking Sal.  Sal almost grabbed it.  Shetty, get on a mic.  Find a microphone.  What?  Shetty, guys.  Oh, my son.  Where are you going, Marion?  Bobo.  Why?  Here.  Get some air.  He pays a guy 20 bucks to fuck a donut, but earlier, somebody, you know, he was buying  his lotto, and somebody fucked it up, and he was like, what the fuck?  That cost me $10. 
[02:04:30]  Now you've got to buy the fucked up one, and then you've still got to get the other one.  Now I have something to think about when I fuck you tonight.  Oh, wow.  Oh, that's pretty brutal.  Yeah.  Really?  Hey, Mike.  You're going to fuck me tonight?  She's going to be thinking about you.  She's going to be thinking about you.  She just comes leaning in.  I know.  I don't think that interests him.  Get away from me.  Oh, no, I knew she was coming because I could smell it about two feet behind.  She smells?  Marion, they're saying you smell.  You get on mic, Marion.  They're saying you stink.  You stink a little bit. 
[02:05:00]  What do you got?  A little spice?  No, I don't.  A little spicy.  I got a bottle of water in my hand.  Oh, Mike, how you doing?  Good, good.  Sorry, Anthony.  How you doing?  Did you see the penthouse girls outside?  I'm waiting to see.  I'm hearing about them.  Sam, when I got here, Sam's like, some hot chicks here.  I'm like, yeah, baby.  Yeah, baby.  Yeah, baby.  I fucking love Mike.  Is Bobo going to get in there with the girls?  Mike, how many fish can you store in your neck?  She's out of breath asking a question.  I love that five of them now. 
[02:05:30]  It's like she ran a marathon when she asks a question.  Is Bobo going to get in there with the girls?  He fucked a donut.  Marion, what's up?  Give me the mic.  I sent me a half and a puffin.  This is good.  Thank you.  Give me the mic.  If she has a heart attack.  Look at her.  Her face is beet red.  Sam, what do we got over there?  Lady Di, what's up?  Is Bobo going to be there?  I'm playing Twister with the girls.  Maybe.  Yeah, Bobo's right.  He's got his underpants on.  You look like Mike after gender reallocation. 
[02:06:00]  He's breathing heavy.  Definitely.  A Mike Fajetti look.  My son.  If Lady Di has a heart attack, can I still get my plugs in?  Yes, of course you can.  Can you imagine her playing Twister and she lands on somebody?  Oh, that could hurt.  Shit.  Right hoof red.  Mike got some ill pants on.  I almost got a girlfriend this year.  What?  What happened?  His computer went out.  His binoculars broke. 
[02:06:30]  Hey, Mike, would you make out with Lady Di?  Do a shirt.  No, no, no, no, no.  Oh, wow.  Don't make Mike.  No, no, no.  I was just asking.  I still want to push the issue of friendship with a woman that don't have you know.  I hear you.  Sure, sure.  Friendship.  He's a gentleman.  He's a gentleman.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I am.  I really am with that kind of stuff.  He came in here with his pants open.  What, you think she's ugly?  No.  I just got friends.  I got a feeling.  I just got a feeling.  I don't know. 
[02:07:00]  She's a skank, isn't she?  No.  You think she's a skank?  No.  You're a little skanky.  What are you doing now?  Because he's staring at me.  Marion's working in the room.  She's walking around.  I know she is.  She's walking around.  She's like fucking when Bobby Vinton leaves the stage and starts singing to the people at  the tables.  Look at you.  She looks like you're right.  She looks like you're right.  I'm looking away because he's looking at me while he's trying to talk to Diane and I'm trying  to tell him Diane's behind him.  Yeah, I know.  What do you think?  He's got the hots for you?  Diane looks like she walked out of a bar at 6 a.m. 
[02:07:30]  Oh, yeah.  I did not walk out of a bar.  Oh, God.  There's her answering.  I have in the past, though.  Believe me.  After a month.  After I was born, she was in the past.  Yeah, of course.  You're my friend.  What a disaster.  Oh, they're hugging.  They're hugging.  Oh.  Jesus Christ.  You know what keeps them together?  Gravity.  It didn't mean a girl in the street, though.  Congratulations.  It looks like the display of the two atomic bombs.  Where do you do comedy at? 
[02:08:00]  Do you do Caroline's?  It depends on who wants to give me the money to go.  I really don't care where it is.  Wait, hold on, hold on.  Mike, you met a girl on the street.  What's that about?  Actually, a lot of people have to be doing a weather report now.  I know.  It's hilarious.  Yeah, I love that.  It's hilarious.  It's a great bit.  She came over to me, she started talking to me.  Yeah.  She had a rabbit hat on.  She was hot half my age.  Rabbit hat?  It was cold.  It was cold.  So I just, you know, rubbed the rabbit hat and we started talking.  She came into the show.  Take another picture.  She gave me a number.  She's from Florida, but never heard back from her. 
[02:08:30]  Ah, that bitch.  Can I call her a whore?  You can.  Fucking whore.  Wow.  I'm sorry.  And a skank, probably.  Whore and a skank, probably.  She's skankin'.  Yeah.  What's Bulbo doing now?  This is like a casting call.  Oh, for the body they drag out of the river on, like, Law and Order or something.  We're casting a floater.  Yes.  We need a floater.  Guys, the thing is, this one of these girls half my age hot, I don't think anybody's out  of my league, which sounds obnoxious. 
[02:09:00]  You don't think anybody's out of your league?  No one's out of your league.  No one's out of your league.  You're right.  We're all in the same league.  No, no, you can.  I think it's.  Look, I think what's happening here is my relationship with Rich is giving him hope.  Oh, yes, yes, yes.  No, no.  Bonnie's a zillion percent right.  I see this and I'm like, things do happen in life.  So no one's out of your league.  No.  Any girl is fair game.  Well, over the age of mid-twenties, you know what I mean? 
[02:09:30]  Mid-twenties.  What are you, like old maids?  He has a cast, a couch, and a van.  Woody Allen's been texting my daughter.  Should I be concerned?  You should be a little disconcerned.  Listen, we've got to take a break.  We've got to regroup here.  I guess we are the perfect couple right here.  I think they want to fuck her.  Oh, wow.  Hey, Ty, you made a move on Mike Cossetti.  What happened, Lady Dye?  Y'all might have to just go fuck. 
[02:10:00]  Lady Dye is the farniest thing.  You want to make out, Mike?  Now you've got to make out.  You've got to make out.  You've got to make out.  You've fucked up with that.  I just, you know.  You've got to make out.  I don't like this.  I think you've got to.  This is like The Walking Dead meets Days of Wine and Roses.  When you tell Bill about this show, and you tell Bill you're showing your tits to all  these people, what do you think he's going to say to you?  Just shut up, man.  You're here to show your tits to people.  He knows about that.  He's going to show your tits to people in years.  Just hang a donut between the two.  It'll be like a scene out of From Here to Eternity. 
[02:10:30]  Listen, Nick, I want a piece of candy.  I don't have any candy.  Mike, can you make out with Lady Dye for the show?  Yeah, you can make out.  A little bit.  A little bit.  We'll give you 30 seconds on the clock.  What about the regurgitate?  Regurgitate.  I can use the practice.  White people call it regurgitate, or we call it regurgitate.  30 seconds on the clock?  Make a friend happy show, why not?  Ah, Mike Fischetti!  And Lady Dye are going to make out for 30 seconds.  No, no, no, wait a minute.  I need to practice.  What?  Well, how about, how about...  I don't make out on the first date. 
[02:11:00]  What are you talking about?  Why don't you guys go out and come back in, it'll be the second date.  Wait, I got it, I got it.  Hold on, let's get a donut in both your mouths, and then you're kind of like, kind of like  that scene from Lady and the Tramp with a donut.  All right, Lady and the Tramp, but instead of the pasta, it's with a donut.  What, Mike?  What?  How about...  You guys should have said a spaghetti thing.  You were kidding, that's nice.  Yeah, let's do the donut thing.  Oh, yeah.  Heart.  We got a heart donut.  It's perfect.  See, it's not officially making out.  I thought I could have watched this delicious donut donut.  Are they really going... 
[02:11:30]  Hold on, let me get this on video.  Hold on.  Is that a big kahuna donut?  Fucking hell.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Lady Di can't wait for the donut.  Hold on.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  I know, she's going after it.  Yeah, baby.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Give it a donut.  Yeah.  Oh, here we go.  They're feeding each other donut.  What?  I want to know for which one of them is at the bottom.  You know what I mean?  Like, who's going to rehab after this?  Who's bottoming out right now?  Who wakes up tomorrow and goes, that was the worst? 
[02:12:00]  Wow.  All right.  Now, you know.  You can't figure out how to do this.  Yeah.  Put it in her donut and make it out.  I don't want donuts.  I don't want donuts.  Don't eat donuts, Diana.  Don't eat donuts.  That's the biggest lie I heard since you could keep your fucking health care if you like  it.  Well, what's in your mouth?  We're going to give her a bagel.  The biggest lie says we're going to close Guantanamo.  She's a savory, not a sweet.  It's not working.  Huh?  Bagels?  No, it's not bagels.  Why don't they just, why don't you just do without them? 
[02:12:30]  You guys want to make out?  I can't believe I'm trying to facilitate this.  I know.  Of course.  I used to work at a Dunkin' Donuts.  No one gives a fuck.  They call it the empty shell Dunkin' Donuts.  Heating the inventory isn't called working there.  Right.  All right.  You know what, Rich?  Please don't address me.  That was funny, Rich.  Thank you for validating my existence.  Load up people.  Shit out of munchkins like a paintball gun.  All right.  We've got to regroup, obviously. 
[02:13:00]  Can I read these?  Yeah.  Rich Voss and Bonnie are here.  They're getting real plugs today.  What's going on, Rich?  This Friday and Saturday, Garner State Comedy Club in Clinton.  Late Friday night, I'll be in Hoboken at a club called, it's at 11 o'clock show at Biggie's  in Hoboken on Friday.  Next weekend, Uncle Vinny's, Uncle Vinny's Rebel Casino, a bunch of places.

He wants to do a save the date.  Right.  Okay.  Fair.  Hey, Rich, when are you going to be at Caroline's Comedy Club again?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Jesus Christ.  All right, listen.  Also, I posted a video of Lady Diane Marion singing that New York, New York from earlier.  Oh, it was fantastic.  I just tweeted it.  Don't be ready on Twitter if you want to check that out. 
[02:14:00]  It was fantastic.  Anthony Cumia on Twitter.  Yes.  We got stalker Patty still.  We got penthouse girls, and we're going to figure out exactly what we're going to do  next.  But first, Bobo's naked in the corner.  All right, we'll get her in in a second.  Oh, fully naked.  Why is he still naked?  I don't know.  Danny, take us out for a minute or two here.  Did Dr. Steve call?  Oh, shit.  Yeah, let's get this party rolling one more time.  That's the shit right here.

[02:16:30]  Yeah, we are back.  O.P. Anthony Super Show.  Volume 2.  And baby, we ain't stopping.  What's going on, Rich?  What's going on over there, Rich?  What's going on over there, Rich?  I'm going to smash the door.  How about everybody?  She's sexy more than I have.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Put your hands up in the air.  What are little kids at?  39, put your arms down.  It stinks in here. 
[02:17:00]  Show me what you got.  Yeah.  Look at Bobo naked over there.  Jesus.  Bobo naked over there.  Oh, my God.  Look at the jelly belly.  Bobo.  Bobo.  Bobo, Mary, it said you have a jelly belly.  What the fuck?  I'll leave you up working now to try to lose it.  Bob's drinking.  It's drinking.  He has the droopiest underwear I've ever seen in my life.  What's going on with his underwear?  I don't totally wear these.  He's like buying new underwear like every couple of months. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, yeah.  The elastic is just all stretched out.  Why, Bobo?  We can't hear you, Bobo.  I can't hear you.  It said the bottom of the drawer underwear.  What does that do?  Oh, yeah.  Maybe that's it.  Why am I going to hamper on it?  Look at that.  If he's like, Brad, does he never wear them?  Yeah, like top shelf underwear, bottom shelf.  But do those underwears start off white and now they're gray? 
[02:18:00]  They are gray.  And, like, your balls are ready to fall out of the side.  Look how hairy he is.  Is it a full moon?  Bobo, can we...  How old are you, Bobo?  31.  What kind of underwear is it, though?  Bobo, can we check for racing stripes?  Yeah, turn around.  You got any racing stripes there?  Oh, God.  Oh, no.  This is going to be bad.  All right, Sam, pull out the underwear to see if there's any racing stripes in there.  Chocolate.  Oh.  Bonnie's just sitting there like Woody Allen's kid looking at the trains. 
[02:18:30]  She's just reading the newspaper like, I'm not here.  I'm not here.  I didn't know we were back on.  Oh, God.  I don't know what's happening.  Thank you.  If you strip down to your skeebies, I wouldn't mind seeing you.  Skeebies?  Yeah, that might be your underwear is skeebies.  Yeah, that might be your underwear is skeebies.  All right, should we reset?  We're Stalker Patty. 
[02:19:00]  And Sam's telling me that we've got to actually do some of these games, because it's an official  contest.  I don't think we have enough.  There's not enough crazy people in here.  We're all crazy, Bonnie.  Oh, look at that.  Oh, look at that.  Oh, look at that.  I like that wee shit.  Hey, you know, we're all like that.  We're all crazy.  Wait, you got over the hill to should have lost her virginity a long time ago.  Oh, Jesus.  I was about out.  Bobo just didn't train Patty.  This guy has the fucking timing of Bobby Kelly.  Here comes the teeth.  How you doing?  How you doing? 
[02:19:30]  How you doing?  Stalker Patty's here.  Patty, what'd you do to your hair?  Patty, you still look good.  Patty looks like she looks good.  She lost some weight.  She put herself together.  Hi.  Patty, what'd you do to your hair?  She was too much of a virgin at Manhattan Starbucks.  She's a virgin.  I like to calm it out once in a while.  Wow.  You know what's sad?  I don't know.  When Stalker Patty walks in and she's the hottie.  Yes.  Patty, you're like the babe in here today.  I found something at home that I've had for many years. 
[02:20:00]  Your virginity.  Your hymen?  Yeah.  Do you remember this?  Oh, wow.  What is that?  What is it?  The original WoW phone card.  I found it.  Wow.  That's so worth bringing up to everybody.  Thank you.  I found it in some piles of paper in like an envelope of keepsakes.  Yeah, amazing.  Keepsakes.  Keepsakes.  Wow.  Keepsakes.  You have a keepsake?  Keepsake.  Yeah.  Keepsake. 
[02:20:30]  Where's your grandma charm bracelet?  Yeah, I know.  The fucking old bat.  She had it for 15 years, everyone.  Take a look.  Yeah.  All right.  I didn't think there was any more around anymore.  Yeah.  That's great.  That's like a fucking Honus Wagner baseball card right there.  She really likes to hang on to stuff.  She does.  It's just when they were popular.  All right.  That hurts.  Hey, he's on our show.  Yeah, exactly.  Just beating up yourself.  Yeah.  Machetti, anything before we move on?  You're good. 
[02:21:00]  I think Machetti should make out with stalker Patty.  Leave she's looking.  Oh, Patty won't do it.  They don't understand.  It was an easy concept.  Lady Di keeps a fucking donut in her mouth and Mike Machetti eats and makes out with her.  She doesn't like the donuts.  You can tell by her shape.  Right.  She's not in.  She cares very much about what she puts into her mouth.  Exactly.  Her body's a temple.  She looks like.  She's shaped like a pyramid.  You ever see a before picture?  She looks before that. 
[02:21:30]  What Bobo?  Someone on Twitter or a whack bag asked me a question.  What do I think?  Who do I think's got a good chance of winning in curling?  I don't even get curling.  I freaking sweep that under the rug.  Is this an Olympic break?  All right.  Thanks for that.  That was great.  That was like Norton's anger on stage.  Why don't you slip into a curling ring?  Right.  He just, you know, it's beyond a non sequitur. 
[02:22:00]  It goes beyond that.  You know what?  He's alternative.  Oh, he is.  He's an alternative comic.  All right.  Patty, how are you?  I'm fine.  Doing well.  Don't you have to work today?  You look great.  Isn't there a sparkle in her eye?  I just want to say something.  She got bangs.  Her hair looks good.  You just want to say something?  She looks really good.  Yeah.  Let's bring it back to me.  Her hair looks good.  I just want to say something.  Well, I'm married.  What?  What? 
[02:22:30]  What's up?  As Bubba oils himself up.  Oh, fuck.  I'm going to smash a donut in her face.  All right.  Should we bring in the moisture?  She'll eat it like a wood chipper.  I don't want a donut.  Hey, we're going to bring in the moisture.  All right.  Keep telling yourself you don't want a donut.  Patty looks like she just got moisture.  You know how bad you got to feel waiting to get into this?  Exactly.  Once you get in.  Like, stop touching me.  Wow.  Who's touching you, Rich?  Who's touching me?  Marion.  I'm about to go crazy.  Oh, man.  Oh, wow. 
[02:23:00]  He put a donut in her head.  Oh, my God.  Don't mess up that beautiful hair of Marion's.  Right.  Oh, Marion.  Marion.  He's a celebrity.  He's a celebrity.  He's a celebrity.  He hates being touched, Marion.  He's got three quarters of a million dollars, according to a website.  Don't fucking...  You fuck with that Jen, Michael, Vincent.  Every time I'm around.  You fuck with that Jen, Michael, Vincent.  Every time I try to touch Bill, he goes, stop touching me.  Jesus.  He's got a tight...  Mike Pacchetti.  Hold on.  What?  Find a mic.  Go ahead.  If, you know, ever was a comedy club fight, I would pick the five guys I wanted with me 
[02:23:30]  in a fight.  Wait.  What?  Don't ask for it.  If a fight broke out in a comedy club, right?  Uh-huh.  Okay.  Got that.  Comics usually aren't fighters, but...  Hey.

It's clearly functional.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:24:30]  Well, let's go.  Hi, ladies.  How you doing?  Good.  Hi.  I want to apologize in advance.  Bobo.  I've got practice.  Yes, you've got practice.  Let's Lexi love everyone back.  Lexi's been here before.  Lexi's been here.  She had to give Bobo a sponge bath last time she was here.  Which one's Lexi?  The one in the middle.  The blonde.  I follow Lexi on Twitter and, you know, for a girl that takes her clothes off, I gotta say...  Don't mitigate it.  You just give her the compliment.  Alright, look.  I follow Lexi on Twitter. 
[02:25:00]  Very, um, very funny.  Very funny and very, very smart.  Jesus Christ.  You know what he really does.  I didn't know I'd be siding with the fuckin' hustler chicks.  Yeah, yeah.  But I...  Oh, sorry, sorry.  I'm a big fan of Penthouse.  He's a nice person.  There's a lot to her that people realize.  There's a lot to her that people realize.  What does that even mean?  He was very close.  He was only five words shy of a actual sentence.  Of a coherent sentence, yes.  Let's get Bobo to talk about the girls. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah, Bobo, talk about the girls a little bit.  Bobo, what do you think?  And tell them what you would do to them, if you had the chance.  Yeah, lookit!  Well, Lexi, oh, man, I...  And I hear she's like a legendary squirter.  Oh, shit.  That'd be nice to be squirted by her.  Oh, man.  And then her, I mean, I said her, I'd love to make out with...  It's even...  It's getting bigger.  I've heard about that, man.  It's up to a whopping one and a half inches.  Lookit his dick.  Lookit his dick.  The girth.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:26:00]  All that scar tissue.  Yeah.  It's getting bigger.  It's getting bigger.  It's ripping.  All right, Bobo, go ahead.  Speak up.  Yeah, like she strokes my cock, Lexi.  Oh, man.  Lookit him.  He's getting dirty.  Bobo, touch yourself, touch yourself.  His underwear isn't dirty.  He could be like on the bottom.  His cock is like a vodka bottle.  One of the ones you get on the plane.  Tell him to touch himself as he's doing it.  Listen.  What the fuck?  I'm picking fleas out of the hair. 
[02:26:30]  These girls are paid to look like they're into somebody.  They can't even do it now.  They can't even muster that up.  No, they can't.  It's impossible.  No.  Look at how far away it's pulled from his pant leg.  Oh, my God.  It's just poking out.  His shit is out of here.  It's like a diving board.  What the fuck?  He might.  He might.  That shit is like boing.  Oh, God.  It's moving.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God.  He seems like a high school teacher. 
[02:27:00]  Honestly, you guys should be good.  He should have to tip you at this point.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I gotta be generous.  I'm gonna give her his roses.  He's gonna give roses like Steven Singer gold dip rose.  Go ahead, Bobo.  I'll listen for a second.  Hold on.  Give Bobo a minute to talk to the ladies.  Go, Bobo.  I think Bobo should put his hand in his pants.  And she's like ramming that cock at her pussy.  And Lexi's just like really loving this.  You know what's amazing?  He can't have two words together. 
[02:27:30]  But he...  He can dirty talk.  He can dirty talk.  He can dirty talk.  He's pretty good at it.  He can dirty talk.  He can dirty talk.  He can dirty talk.  He's pretty good at it.  Look at that.  They're like sharing it.  Look at his fucking thing.  These girls are thinking of career changes.  Oh, my God.  You know, I can always go back to school.  I got that apex tech.  I like cars.  Daddy, you're gonna like me again.  They give me my own set of tools upon graduation.  Well, I think about it.  Waitressin wasn't so bad. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah.  She's really loving how it's feeling.  Look at him, though.  Oh, I can't...  I can't stop.  He's just talking.  I think she's bending over.  I'm really...  Hey, Sam.  Oh, Jesus.  He's fucking moving his hips now.  But why would he show that move?  This shit is out of here.  Bobo, you know what you do to close the deal?  What?  Turn around and twerk these girls.  That's right.  Yeah.  Come on.  Yeah, if I could do it, you can.  Holy shit.  Oh, that reminds me.  They canceled Michael J. Fox's show.  That was terrible. 
[02:28:30]  I just...  He needs music.  Hold on a second.  Yeah.  Bobo, turn away from the ladies.  I gotta ask you one thing.  No, over here, but...  No, listen to me.  Bobo's a big Mets fan, and we lost Ralph Kiner.  You have a few words about Ralph Kiner before we got it.  I have to say, that was a sad loss.  The last member of the original Mets.  It goes from fucking here to do it.  Watch this.  I'm a big...  What's gonna happen?  Being a big Mets fan, that's like the last thing to the history.  His boner will completely disappear as he talks baseball. 
[02:29:00]  But then within seconds, we will talk again about the girls, and his boner will come back.  And this guy would always get great guests on Conner's Corner.  Oh, well, wow.  This is...  It's gonna take a lot of baseball to get that thing going down.  It is going down.  It is going down.  Yeah, it is.  But at the end, they wound up and enjoyed being a part of Conner's Corner.  Really?  How long was he with the Mets?  He was around since the very beginning in 1962.  1962?  He lost it.  Yup. 
[02:29:30]  The very beginning.  And what was the last time he did a broadcast for the Mets about?  Last season, he was part of Conner's Corner.  And what was he known for?  Like his mistakes.  He made a couple of mistakes a few times.  He would make some mistakes.  Like what?  Give us an example.  He said that it was George Strawberry.  George Strawberry.  Right.  Oh, man.  And then he said, what was the Father's Day one?  He goes, oh, it's Father's Day, so I want to wish all the fathers a happy birthday.  Paul's completely gone as he talks about Ralph Conner. 
[02:30:00]  That one I kind of forgot about a little bit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But I remember the George Strawberry one.  Right, right.  And who was he in the booth with?  Oh, good question.  He was in the booth with the original team.  It was him.  Yup.  The great Bob Murphy and Lindsey Nelson.  Of course.  There you go.  Back in the days when the Mets were on WOR, the first TV station.  Well, you did Ralph Conner well today.  So let's get back to the penthouse girls.  His went down.  His dance went up.  Mine went up.  That shit left the building. 
[02:30:30]  Look, it went down.  Now watch what happens.  And then she's saying like, damn you.  Look, it's moving.  It's moving.  It's moving.  It's amazing.  Look at this.  It's alive.  It's moving.  It's alive.  It's moving.  It's alive.  That thing is...  Oh, Jesus.  It's alive.  Oh, it's alive.  It's alive.  It's alive.  Back in full force.  Yo.  He's back up to full power.  How weird is that?  How weird is that? 
[02:31:00]  How weird is that?  How weird is that?  Holy shit.  Yeah.  The power of Grayskull.  Look at him.  He's back.  Oh, my God.  He's back.  I'm amazed that he knew that much about baseball.  He knows baseball.  It's so weird.  And he knows how some people can be like mentally handicapped.  Oh, it's amazing.  We do remember.  Right.  Wapner and counting the matchsticks and blackjack.  That is amazing.  Rich is not mentally handicapped, knows nothing.  Yes.  Oh, wait.  Wait, wait.  We need a mic for you. 
[02:31:30]  Oh, Mike.  We're trying to control this a little bit.  What's that, Mike?  Then we stopped and came out and had a vintage car.  Yes.  Yes.  I think they had a vintage one first.  I forgot it was a sports car.  I can't remember.  Anthony, by the way, Super Show 2 is sponsored by Steven Singer Jewelers.  How proud he must be.

[02:32:00]  Rich.  Rich is such a racist.  There's not one smile on the past girls' faces.  Oh, my God.  You are completely disgusted by this whole thing.  Do you love it?  I have to say, you're an amazing artist.  I've seen some of your stuff.  Who's an amazing artist?  An amazing artist?  Who's an amazing artist?  Sure is Picasso and Rembrandt.  He has sides to her that people don't know about.  Oh.  She's an actual person.  She's got...  She's an actual person.  We didn't know that.  Thanks. 
[02:32:30]  She's not just a support song.  You are really...  She's not just a what?  Bob, I think you should put your hands in your pants while you're talking to me.  Oh, God.  You would like to have a lot better.  No, come on.  Come on.  Are you kidding?  Let him enjoy the moment at least.  Jesus.  Sam, what do we got?  What are we doing now?  Well...  Oh, I'm sorry.  I apologize.  Are you enjoying this at all?  I don't have enough caffeine in me.  I have some terror.  That's true.  Get this girl a cup of coffee, for the love of God.  But were you impressed how easy it went up and down? 
[02:33:00]  She's a bunch of terror, and that's just not a turn-on.  I'm sorry.  No, no.  And that's coming from an Asian girl.  I know.  We didn't think it would be a turn-on, quite frankly.  Okay, thank you.  Yeah, we weren't going for the turn-on.  Yeah, the turn-on factor, we just eliminated them.  Look at those lips.  Can you imagine him...  Wow, he's got poutier lips than me.  Oh, wow.  Can you imagine him chewing on your girl cave?  Come on.  Ah, shit, girl cave.  Jesus Christ.  Stop really bringing the romance into this.  Hey, Bonnie, how's your girl cave? 
[02:33:30]  That's what I call Bonnie's.  Ah, that's wonderful.  Well, what are we going to do now that Bobo is lubed up?  He's got cheese on his chest.  Yeah, he's got jelly donut on his side.  He's got killing in his eyes.  Yes, murder in his eyes.  Jesus.  Lexi Love, how are you?  It's been a while.  Lexi.  I'm fantastic.  How are you guys?  Sounds like she's being held hostage.  She kind of is.  Yeah, I'm their publicist. 
[02:34:00]  I dress like this all the time when I take the girls around.  It's got like a little gold shorts.  Very cute.  Very cute.  Very cute.  All the girls are very cute.  Yeah, they are.  This girl on the end is like, why am I doing this?  I don't blame her.  I don't blame you at all.  I'm just chilled.  No, there's nothing wrong with that.  There's nothing wrong with that.  You've been here before.  Yeah, this is my second time.  And when you were here last time, what was going on in this room?  Um...  Jimmy's birthday.  Yeah.  Oh, it's Jimmy's birthday.  All right.  I got him some cake. 
[02:34:30]  Right.  I eat some cake.  Right.  I did have...  Now you want to see someone that eats some cake.  Look at the Lady Di over there.  What?  Holy shit, look at that disaster.  Jane, listen, I don't know.  I bought a shirt and the threading's fucked up.  Could you call...  Oh, forget it.  Lady Di looks like the Exxon Valdez slammed into her head.  Look at that fucking hair.  What is she doing over there?  Look at her!  Marion, come back to the table.  Get Marion on mic again.  Marion, what's going on over there?  She parted her hair.  What's going on over here, I will tell you. 
[02:35:00]  She is so obsessed with Twitter.  She's looking to see if anybody on Twitter is talking about her.  And this is my wife.  I don't care if they say anything about me, but I don't have a Twitter.  Let it go until later, Diana.  My wife said I can make out with any girl for eight seconds.  Eight seconds.  Oh, wow.  That's pretty good.  Really?  That's a good woman.  I said he can do anything he wants with any girl for eight seconds.  As long as it's mutual.  I don't want to break somebody.  What if someone sets the girl up, gets her all lubed up and ready to go, and he just 
[02:35:30]  runs at her and jams his dick in her?  If he wants to do that kind of work to get it going, that's fine.  Why do you come up with eight seconds, though?  I just feel like it's not enough time.  Not much shenanigans can happen?  No, but you thought about it.  I call her bluff.  Is it that time that he thinks that he's getting something?  I'd call her bluff and have my dick in a girl's ass for eight seconds.  Go do it.  Go do it.  Eight fucking seconds.  First of all, eight seconds.  Can I just say this?  Yes.  The eight seconds starts when he takes the blue pill.  So that's...  Oh, no. 
[02:36:00]  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  Damn.  Don't wah, wah me.  No, wah, wah.  You didn't get it.  I wasn't wah, wah.  I'm lying.  I was making fun of his non-functional penis.  Now that I've got two ladies on my arm.  He's no Bobo.  I'll tell you that.  Yeah, wow.  Yeah, look at Bobo.  Bobo's ready at a moment's notice.  Oh, is he?  His fists are clenched.  Why does he have his arms to the side like that?  Yeah, he's like...  Because he looks like mighty Joe Bobo.  It looks like one of those pictures in the medical journals where he should have the black 
[02:36:30]  bar over his eyes.  Yeah, no, he's like trying to figure out how he's going to cut them up after.  Yeah.  Hold on, I'm trying to be nice to these girls.  Trying to be nice.  That's what they want to hear.  Is that working out for you?  He's trying to control his emotions.  Your charm is off the charts.  Alright, Sam, what do we got?  Let's do this.

It's like a spy code from the Cold War.  If he said that, like missiles would be launched.  Do you know how scared...  It's...  It doesn't make any sense.  She can't drink anything.  How scared Dalton Hedden must have been when he first saw them.  She can't.  The woods are lovely, dark and deep, but I have promises to keep. 
[02:38:00]  And miles to go before I sleep.  She cannot drink until we get to Branson.  Remember Branson.  What?  The chair is against the wall.  Alright, we got your...

[02:39:00]  Because she's annoyed at Lady Di already.  Uh-oh, Patty.  And can we get a mic on Lady Di as well?  If I can twerk...  That's so funny.  Hold on, hold on.  And then you can do a little twister.  Oh, man.  In your face.  In your face.  In your face.  She's fucking smack.  That's right.  I can't do that.  Patty, you're annoyed with Lady Di, right?  She still hasn't found a job.  But if I could twerk, she could do that.  Thanks.  Wow.  You know what that is?  In Patty...  In Patty, uh...  Like, language, that was...  Hey, go fuck yourself.  Right.  That sounds like Steve.

I, I, for me, when I have sex with my husband, I have to like, use my weight in lube.  Let me tell you.  Did you say you would need that?  It would be, it would be easier to fuck a catcher's mitt.  Okay?  It's more moist.

It's really that bad, huh?  Yeah, it's not bad.  We just want to play the game.  We just want to play the game and get the fuck out of here.  I can't get stuck to my microphone.  This is so awesome.  I love these girls.  His dick is out of here.  Look, he's sort of cool.  I believe Opie has the twister board in front of him. 
[02:46:30]  Okay.  The spinner.  To find out where we're going to start.  All right, here we go, ladies.  I just want to say this, first of all.  Is that...  Oh, here we go.  These girls are hot.  But any woman who walks in here and sees the mess that is fucking going on and then goes,  you know what?  I'm going to get naked.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's a level of...  There's a problem.  There is a problem.  There's some issue going on.  Look at Lady Di taking pictures.  I was looking into their eyes the whole time, like, can you believe we're all in this mess together?  And now I'm like, what? 
[02:47:00]  What's happening?  What is happening?  Well, Bobo's getting oiled up nicely for...  Yeah, Lady Di's rubbing her head on him.  They're fine with it.  All right, should we start?  Let's start the game, Opie.  All right.  Spinning the spinner, Opie.  Oh, my God.  Jesus, that takes forever.  The only thing better on that Asian girl would be if she had a penis.  Right hand red.  Everybody put their right hand on red.  Right hand red.  Right hand red.  Bobo.  Oh, my God.  Right hand. 
[02:47:30]  Oh, my God.  The other hand.  Bobo, move off the board.  You're taking up every red spot.  Yeah, come on.  Right hand on red.  Right hand on the twist.  That's very good.  Oh, my God.  Right hand red.  Look at her ass.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  There you go in front of you.  Oh, my God.  All right, here we go.  All right.  Oh, fuck the shit.  Left hand.  What's the cloud?  Purple cloud.  What does that mean?  I don't know.  Let's spin again.  Left hand.  Purple cloud.  Is there...  Left hand.  I don't know how to play Twister. 
[02:48:00]  What does that mean?  I think they updated the Twister game.  Why do they do that?  They haven't spin it and board.  What?  They definitely changed them.  Why would they fucking change it around?  What's a left hand purple cloud?  That means you can put your left hand on any spot.  All right.  Fair enough.  Put your left hand on another spot.  Left hand green.  Left hand green.  Does Bobo know his right and his left?  This might be a problem.  It's getting dangerous over here.  Is it?  Is it now?  Bobo cock blue. 
[02:48:30]  Right hand purple.  Move your right hand to another spot.  Are those girls getting paid for them?  No.  They're just doing it.  My mind is like...  Now keep in mind.  Yeah.  If you move your hands...  Oh, okay.  Okay.  The rules are if you move your hands...  Who gives a fuck with the ring?  You want to see some tits and ass, right?  Just the one.  No, not my sandwich.  Now you know.  Right foot green.  Okay.  Now just keep your hands there and put your right foot on green. 
[02:49:00]  Prince just farted in Lady Di's face.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Look at that spot.  Right hand purple.  Move your right hand to another spot.  I was going to smack your ass.  Free spot.  Free spot.  Right hand.  Right foot purple.  Now move your right foot to another spot.  There's no rules.  Do you understand how Mike can ever jog after this to outrun what's happened?  Oh, let's see. 
[02:49:30]  I thought you wanted to look like that.  I think...  All right.  Left foot purple.  Next position is fetal position in the bottom of the shower.  What's next?  Right foot blue.  Right foot blue.  It needed the money.  All right.  Right foot blue.  Mary G might be out.  No, I never did it.  Oh, shit.  She's taking it seriously.  Yeah, she doesn't want to be out of this. 
[02:50:00]  All right.  She's there.  She's there.  All right.  Let's go.  All right.  What's the next one?  We're going to go left foot yellow.  Left foot yellow.  We don't know all the skin tags.  Come on, Bobo.  Bobo.  I didn't mean that.  Bobo.  Right armpit skin tag on green.  Oh, it's horrible.  He's got stalagmites growing under his fucking armpits.  It's a little shock buddy.  Jesus Christ.  Right foot red.  Right foot red.  Right foot red. 
[02:50:30]  Bobo, try not to let your ball bag rub on the fucking mat as much as it is.  Oh, shit.  Uh-oh.  It's part of the game.  What happened, Sam?  Mary G's having trouble.  She got it, though.  Mary G's having some trouble.  All right.  Let's go with, uh...  You can't take the pent-up sexual body heat.  Get out of the kitchen.  Left hand yellow.  Left hand yellow.  Left hand yellow.  If you're gonna fall, just grab that bunch of broccoli hanging from his armpit and hang 
[02:51:00]  on to your wife.  Is it really that bad?  Oh, it's terrible.  Yes.  What's that?  He's got giant fucking skin tags.  Left hand green.  How much am I winning for this?  Right hand venereal wart.  Oh, Bobo's loving this.  Got it.  All right.  Let's go with, uh...  I don't know.  Let's go with, uh...  Right hand red.  Right hand red.  Oh, my...  Bobo, Bobo didn't have a hard-on for days. 
[02:51:30]  Bobo's blocking everybody.  It's amazing.  And for those of you playing at home, Bobo is bent over and his ass reeks today.  Bobo...  Oh, no.  Jesus.  Shower?  Mary G's out.  Mary G's out.  Mary G's out.  Wait, why is she out?  She looks disgusted.  Oh, my God.  Bobo, I would personally bring you some nice, soft, and shawry myself.  Wow, wow.  She's flabbergasted from the stench.  I mean, I'm Bobo's ass. 
[02:52:00]  Go, girl.  Wow.  Can you ladies smell Bobo from where you are?  I'm fortunate.  Wait, how?  Does anybody have wife anywhere?  What does it smell like?  She said it smells like an old kimchi pot.  It smells like, oh, look at him.  Hold on, Rich, Rich.  Hold on, hold on.  What does it smell like?  Like a dirty asshole.  Oh, it smells like rich.  It smells like dirty asshole.  I was literally gagging.  She's the cleanest asshole in the bathroom.  Bobo, come on. 
[02:52:30]  She was gagging.  Wow.  It's 2014.  She was gagging, and she never gags, believe me.  And I love gagging.  I like that.  What's the next spot?  Left-hand green.  Wow.  Left-hand green.  Does his ass really smell that bad?  Oh, yeah.  I can smell it from here.  Do we have some money?  Bobo.  Shit stings.  Huh?  There's freaking shit stings in your ass.  How gross, Bobo.  Shit stings.  Wait, wait.  We got to have someone smell a lot of Bobo's ass.  It should have cleaned your ass better.  We got some jewelry we can give away. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah, who wants to smell Bobo's ass for jewelry?  Oh, wow.  It's like you're mad.  I do.  Of course the Jew says that.  Of course.  Of course the Jew raises it.  Oi!  Hi, it does it.  Oi!  I'm coming here.  I'm going to say the word.  We got to have someone smell Bobo's ass.  Maybe the cloud on the spinner is the stench coming out of Bobo's ass.  Really reeks.  Stinking the whole room up.  All right, so we say if we get a purple one, you have to move your hand and smell Bobo's ass.  Oh, wow.  No.  Yeah, I mean, because this game is going to go on forever. 
[02:53:30]  Exactly.  All right, that's a very good point, Sam.  Very good.  Okay.  If it lands on purple, they both have to smell his ass.  That's right.  All right, it's left hand blue.  Left hand blue.  Left hand blue, Bobo.  That's good.  There it is.  We'll have a lot of pictures at the O&A show soon.  She's in Kung Fu class.  Oh, jeez.  We got right hand green.  Right hand green.  Look at her legs are gorgeous.  This is crazy that you're in.  They're going to tell you after this.  Wow.  It's a mess. 
[02:54:00]  Nice, long, shapely.  He needs to be in a group home.  What is he doing here?  Bad news.  Bad news.  Uh-oh.  Bad news.  It's purple.  It's purple.  It's purple.  It's purple.  It's purple.  Left hand purple.  So what does that mean?  You have to move your left hand anywhere you want and smell Bobo's ass.  Bobo, you should be at least a little sweeter.  Mike the girl.  Okay.  It's for a girl.  All right.  You have to give Bobo's ass a quick smell.  A little snippet.  Oh.  Bobo.  Then you might be out of the game.  Bobo's.  Oh, darn.  You got to have Bobo lift his ass up.  Bobo, lift your ass up a little bit.  Disgusting. 
[02:54:30]  All right, you're out then.  Disgusting.  Okay, stand up.  Sorry.  Lexi, will you smell Bobo's ass?  Oh, man.  Don't I just swim by default?  No, Bobo's in.  I think she's right.  She's the last one.  But you got to do it.  You got to do it for the win.  Oh.  Or we don't have a winner.  For the win.  For the win.  Wow.  For the win.  For the win.  Woo!  Amazing.  Amazing.  All right, that one is complete.  Lexi loves the winner of the round. 
[02:55:00]  Wow, that's crazy.  Is she scoring a one round?  That's right.  Different game.  It's not all twister.  Let's play spin the bottle.  I think these girls are much too attractive to be involved in such chicanery as oily fucking  bobo twister.  Bobo, what's with the eyes?  You look like a mad cat.  I was nervous today.  Why were you nervous today?  You're nervous today?  You're not showing...  You did this.  You're not showing...  Why are you nervous?  I was thinking great.  No, I was nervous at how it was going to turn out. 
[02:55:30]  Like, once I've noticed everything that happened, like, no...  Big event like a wedding.  Well, there you go.  There you go.  I think if I could, I was a little bit nervous today, Bob.  I think it would find today, and this would be a great memory with these sweet girls.  A great memory with these sweet girls.  Guys, I don't know.  Here with the lovely Lexi Love joins the party.  What are you trying to hook up a foursome?  No, she's a great girl to be with.  You hold out your fucking mind.  Slow down.  No, no, no.  Try to hook up with her. 
[02:56:00]  She's a great girl to be around with.  Because she'll smell your best.  Like I said, I would take him with me for the whole weekend.  Wow.  Like, that smell, Bobo, traumatized.  It's not bad.  Would you scrub him down?  Last time we gave him a bath, remember?  We had a little kiddie pool and some bath...  That was Lexi Love.  Bubbles.  And she watched Bobo.  Right.  And got right in there.  We got in there.  Got all the spots.  We're real pros.  And that, by the way, a little trivia.  The last time he washed his ass. 
[02:56:30]  No, actually, I've washed my ass a few times.  A few times.  Since three months ago.  Good.  A number of times.  A number of times.  Since three months ago.  Today I was so nervous when I woke up.  What happened?  You got swamp ass Bobo.  I was under...  I've been under a lot of stress the past few days because of shoveling snow.  So have you been...  Has your stomach hurt?  Snow.  So it makes your ass stick?  You got a little diarrhea?  No, my arms have been hurting from shoveling the snow.  As you can't line properly.  Right.  That makes sense. 
[02:57:00]  I guess it can't affect your fucking unit.  Well, that's the thing.  My unit doesn't lift stuff.  All it does is get boners and piss and all the way I jack off the white stuff.  What you like to call frostbite.  All right, Sam, we're going to take a break.  Yes.  Wow.  Danny, play us out of here.  It's real uncomfortable when we go to break.  All this week comedy club Clinton this weekend, folks.  For Rich Voss.  Very good. 
[02:57:30]  Danny, take us out for a minute or two.  Oh, we got Bobo the Sex Machine, so let's play this one for him.  The Godfather of Soul.  James Brown's in the house.  Get up.  I feel like a sex machine.  Get on up.  Get up.  Get on up.  Stay on the scene.  Get on up.  Like a sex machine.  Get on up.  Wait a minute.  Shake your arm.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It would not be a party unless we brought this one out.  So we want to see if we get everybody here in the studio to get their hands up, because 
[02:58:00]  I know you know how to smell this one.  Hands up.  There's no need to feel down.  I said, young man, get yourself off the ground.  Okay, what's your thoughts on this so far, man?  Super show.  This is the super show concept.  Too much for me to handle it.  It's hilarious.  It's super show, all right?  It's beyond.  Mary, get on, Mike.  We don't need Lady Di.  And what is Lady Di?  You're constantly fiddling with your phone.  She's always fiddling with something.  You're just fiddling with it. 
[02:58:30]  Right.  Always fiddling with something.  Why are you fiddling?  Am I fiddling?  I just took a picture of you and the lovely radio.  Oh, yeah?  Diana, you always fiddling with something.  Then Little Fats, he'll move.  Because I know how to do it.  Don't call him fat.  It's true.  I am not fat.  All right, just click touch me.  I didn't touch you.  That was Diana's time.

[02:59:00]  Well, Bonnie's not going to sit here.  No, no.  Hey, hey, Rich, she doesn't think she's fat.  Yeah, we'll get it.  I am not fat, and I'm not the one that touched you.  And Fowler Connors, you think he's anti-Semitic.  Now I just touch you.  Oh, Mike, what's that he wants in?  Mike, Mike, Mike.  There he is.  He's also like a new version of Cho's Angel of the Smokey.  Wow, that's amazing comic.  Great observation.  What happened to David Chappelle?  Well, he was supposed to come in here two hours ago.  He's doing shit with all the channels right now.  His ankle bracelet went off. 
[02:59:30]  Was two chains in here yesterday?  What about your ankle bracelet?  When did that go off?  I don't think so.  No.  What about your ankle bracelet?  Oh, my God.  How is somebody married to her?  How do they not fucking suffocate her with a pillow?  How do you not fucking really just...  I'm married for 20 years, hon.  Oh, God, if he's not sucking cock somewhere.  No, he's not.  No, he's not.  No, he's not, hon.  All right, he's not, I guess.  What about you?  Jesus Christ.

[03:05:00]  and her and the rest of the hitchhikers arrive at Branson.  Oh, yes.  What?  I like the werewolf reference.  Not drinking a single nanny ice until we get to Branson.  Branson?  What is Branson?  Rat bowels.  Rat bowels.  What is Branson?  Hey, Lady Di, did you change your shampoo to 10W40 for the winter?  Yeah, that's it.  You should probably do that.  Better viscosity.  What are you doing with Branson for? 
[03:05:30]  What is Branson?  She had a real danger problem before.  Yes, yeah.  See that?  Not anymore.  Nothing could live in that.  Holy shit.  As we all know, Greenpeace is rescuing ducks from her.  You can't buy a single drink in Branson, but you're allowed to bring your own booze.  You're not allowed to smoke near her.  She can't drink a single thing, a single ounce of liquor until we arrive at Branson. 
[03:06:00]  Sam, what's going on?  Sam.  We've got to stop our foreign dependency on Di's head.  Guys, let's make this more interesting.  Your slams have to be three words or less.  Whoa.  You're getting really wordy, Bobo.  Then I'm going to out vomit her.  There you go.  Great.  Yes.  That's it.  I don't want to have to have a map and a thesaurus and everything.  I'm sure you guys know the saying, brevity is the soul of wit. 
[03:06:30]  Oh.  That's the saying that's right next to, I'll out vomit you.  Lady Di, what do you got?  She's got to come and show how smart she is amongst them.  Oh, yeah.  And I'm going to out vomit her when we get there.  Ah.  You didn't need the when we get there, do you see?  Yes, obviously.  You'll be drinking.  You'll be such a monster.  You're going to want to chuck the daddy ice.  It's beyond me.  See, if you just said you're a monster, boom.  Right.  That would have worked, Bobo. 
[03:07:00]  You wouldn't know who was saying it to who.  Yeah.  Oh, girls.  Again, girls, I have to apologize to you.  You're much too lovely.  That's a great gig for these girls.  You're too lovely to be standing around naked.  Oh, but we don't mind it.  Sam, let's get on to the next activity.  Next activity.  What do we got?  All right.  Another activity.  Well, there's a lap dance competition.  Oh.  All right.  All right.  Real money up for grabs, too.  That's good.  Who's the, who's the, who gets the lap dance on his lap?  Lady Di can't do it because we don't have metal chairs. 
[03:07:30]  If it's for the biggest lap, you win.  Okay.  If it's in need of a lap band surgery.  No, you're not giving me a lap dance.  Okay.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right.  I'll clarify then.  Okay.  Mike Buschetti should get a lap dance from Lady Di, I'm thinking.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Mike Buschetti should be the recipient.  Mike?  Oh, I don't know.  Recipient.  No, no, that's okay.  What?  Really?  What's the matter?  What's the matter? 
[03:08:00]  What's the matter, Mary?  What's the matter, Mary?  What's the matter, Mary?  You know what?  All these people that are going to be on Twitter, Twittering you mean things, you'll be calling  me later on.  I don't care about that.  That's what they said to me.  That's great.  You'll be calling me.  I'm saying all the stuff that they've said.  So she shouldn't have showed her tits as much as she had today, right?  Yeah, because you know what? 
[03:08:30]  Why is it okay for them and it's not okay for her?  That's Marian.  What?  I didn't show no tits.  It's Marian's problem.  Yeah, yeah.  What about these girls?  You're not, you're not...  You're not mad at these girls for showing their tits?  No, no, I'm not talking about these girls.  I'm talking about Diane.  They should be showing their tits, right?  Why?  I'm talking about Diane.  All right, pony boy hair.  It's because any time somebody says anything...  Stay going, fatso.  Any time somebody says something mean about Diane on Twitter, she tells me.  And she says some people could be mean and evil.  And then she deletes all of these people. 
[03:09:00]  And blocks these people.  Twitter lawyer.  That's not right.  If she's a Twitter lawyer.  No, but she does it.  She'll tell me about it.  I don't know about it.  I don't know about it.  I don't know about it.  I don't know about it.  I'm looking for rent of Hamiath Corp.  I don't know about it.  I'm looking for rent of Hamiath Corp.  I don't know about it.  Mike Buscetti, what?  What?  Mike's trying to talk.  No, I've been trying to hear somebody else.  For three years.  I don't know what to say.  I'm just taking this all in and just...  Ah, yes, you are.  Everything's trying to process a lot of you.  I don't know why. 
[03:09:30]  There's a lot to process.  I don't know.  I'm trying to process a lot of this.  All right, Sam.  How is this going to work?  Well, the recipient of the lap dances and the judge is Stalker Patty.  Stalker Patty gets lap dances today.  Come on, Patty.  It's your turn to get into Thunderdome.  Three hemoglobins.  Patty, are you excited to get lap dances from these lovely ladies? 
[03:10:00]  Look at her eyes.  That would be interesting.  Nice little fucking metal music we got in here.  One eye is looking to the right.  Oh, man.  It's not a great chair for a lap dance.  The girls are choosing straws like who's going to have to fucking go out on the life raft and find out.  Patty looks like Carrie 20 years later.  Holy shit.  Carrie is still shocked. 
[03:10:30]  Yes.  And Lady Di's hair looks like the blood just fell on it.  Wow, what a disaster.  Lady Di, you've got to shower next time you come in here.  Come on, Lady Di.  Jesus Christ.  I will.  I will.  Not she.  Not I did.  I will.  Yeah, it's true that I did.  Right.  And not mysterious.  Lady Di's hair looks like the blood just fell on it.  It's very close.  Yeah.  Huh?  All right.  Let's do this, Sam.  All right.  Well, since Lexi won the last competition, she gets to pick what order she goes in, right?  Oh. 
[03:11:00]  Oh, Lexi.  Where do you want to go?  First, second, or third?  Last.  Last.  So then rock, paper, scissors over who goes first?  Rock, paper, scissors.  Three things I'd rather fuck than Lady Di.  Oh, fuck than Lady Di.  I'm just sitting here.  I'm just sitting here.  I'm just sitting here.  I'm just sitting here.  I'm just sitting here.  I'm just sitting here.  All right.  The Asian's going first.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, shoot.  Shout out to my friend, Jacqueline Novak.  Oh, wow.  Nice.  I like that.  Oh, my God.  That's a lot of...  On my 50th birthday, my friends brought me to a club and I was my good person only. 
[03:11:30]  Nice conversation.  Molly, you've got a lap dance.  It's a lot of fun.  Come on, dude.  Nice ass.  Yeah.  Shit.  Oh, man.  Look at that pussy.  Yeah, right?  I can see it.  That's nice.  How do you look like she's in the electric chair?  She's fucking...  Are you fucking alive?  Somebody press the button.  Right.  She just says the button already.  Fran√ßoise Delacroix, you've been condemned. 
[03:12:00]  I'm sure.  Press the button?  Yeah.  Make sure you wet the sponge before you put it on her head.  What?  No.  I'm not.  I'm not.  All right.  We're might...  We're putting headphones on the lovely ladies from the penthouse so they can hear the music.  Oh, I love it.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Nice, right?  Nice, right?  Not a...  Not a...  Not a dimple on that.  That shit is nice and moist.  Let me try.  What?  Give me...  There's no dimples on what?  The ass. 
[03:12:30]  Rich.  That will come in there.  On TMI, honey.  Yeah.  What do you think, Patty?  Nice?  Very interesting.  Very interesting.  Very interesting.  Very interesting.  You know what was very interesting?  The fucking...  The Bill Nye Kenneth Ham fucking debate.  This is not very interesting.  Right.  It's fucking...  You know, it's supposed to be sexy, you dummy.  Yeah.  Whatever you do, please.  I'm begging you.  Do you believe in evolution?  Yeah. 
[03:13:00]  Well...  Well...  That's very interesting.  We can't put this on the internet, so we'll get in trouble.  What?  Like Starbucks has a morality clause in their fucking contracts?  Yeah.  Well, whatever you do, I don't want so many people seeing this.  Oh, yeah?  Why?  Because you're gonna go in for the finger pop?  Yeah, what are you gonna do?  Try to stick one in the pink and one in the stink?  Yeah.  There's nothing to go at once.  You just put it on the wrong kind of red website.  That's it.  One of the pink and one anywhere on Bobo. 
[03:13:30]  You get a lot of good ones.  Okay, that was a bad one.  One bad one the whole day.  I know, but I get a lot of good ones too.  One bad one.  You've been wonderful today, Rip.  Marion, do you remember when you had a body like that?  Was a goer?  Oh, shit.  You do?  Maybe when she was in the womb.  Were you a goer back then?  What?  What's that?  You little slut?  Yeah.  Big hairy bush though.  How did you and your husband meet?  Yeah, yeah.  Very good question.  How did we meet?  Yeah.  You need a mic.  Oh, for what? 
[03:14:00]  You'd rather not score.  Oh, wow.  Geez, finally shut her up.  Oh, there you go.  Keep it out a little loop.  25 years ago.  All right.  Here we go.  The lap dance has begun.  Stalker Patty enjoyed.  You know what?  It just occurred to me why she doesn't want to talk about it.  They're related.  Yes, the family reunion.  That's where they match.  That would have been funny if you didn't stutter through it.  Wow, Patty is getting a face full of goopies.  There's some grinding going on.  Whoa, Patty, what do you think?  I think it was Patty's boyfriend.  Yeah.  She's hurting my fibromyalgia.  That would have been funny if you didn't stutter through it.  Wow, Patty's getting a face full of goopy. 
[03:14:30]  There's some grinding going on.  Whoa, Patty, what do you think?  She's hurting my fibromyalgia.  Oh, Patty.  Patty, you take it.  You take that shit.  I don't know that's a good chair for a lap dance because it's a rocker.  Oh, sorry.  I'm concerned about their safety.  Yeah.  She just forced Patty's legs separated.  I've never seen anything stuck together so tight. 
[03:15:00]  Yeah, Patty is just like...  Come on, Patty, dig it.  Her ass is right in Patty's face.  It's like a fucking Bruce Lee movie.  Patty, slap her ass a little.  Just slap it.  Go ahead, smack her ass.  Yeah, grab her hips.  Pull them in.  Oh, shit.  Oh, man, look at her.  Patty can't take it.  She's getting excited.  Can I go next?  Patty, are you going to go?  I'm going to give Patty a lap dance.  Oh, shit.  Go with it.  Patty.  What? 
[03:15:30]  Patty, what's the matter?  All right, Patty.  Oh, you're a fuddy-duddy.  Wow.  There you go.  No, she turned around in the chair.  She's putting her legs on either side of Patty's head.  Oh, that pussy's real close now.  Ow.  Ow, that hurts.  Sorry.  Ow.  No.  Oh, it's like watching wrestling.  She's a fuddy-duddy.  It's not.  She's got no pleasure derived from this.  Excuse me.  It's a good one, Patty.  Catching base from misery, she's a fuddy-duddy.  Yes, a fuddy-duddy. 
[03:16:00]  Patty.  Hey, Patty.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Cups in the way.  Oh, sorry.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Oh, Patty.  Look, Patty's in the fucker.  She's ready to tap out.  Come on, man.  Patty, come on, man.  Pussy or something, man.  Pass out.  Why do you pass out?  And that's coming from a black guy.  Eat this shit.  Patty, what's the matter?  Why don't you like this?  It's strange and dirty.  Yeah, it is strange.  Body contact looks strange, yo.  It's strange and crazy. 
[03:16:30]  Yeah.  I like making her feel dirty.  Oh, shit, Patty.  Yeah, Patty.  You like making her feel dirty?  That's hot.  Just walk by her and she'll feel dirty.  Yeah, yeah.  That's good.  She woke up feeling dirty.  Left the house.  This is great.  Look at Bobo playing Caravan in the corner.  He hasn't taken one picture.  He hasn't figured out how to.  He's still trying to focus.  This whole scene reminds me of something.  If Princess Leia was chained up next to Lady Di, 
[03:17:00]  I think I could see the scene here.  Yes, yes, Jabba the Di.  I think that's it.  Good job.  I'm a lot of dance.  Who's next?  I almost said, let's go to number two,  but then I realized someone would take a shit.  Yeah, they take things literally.  All right.  I'm shit.  All that shit you would brand sit.  I'm like Amy Poehler.  Huh? 
[03:17:30]  Oh.  That was extremely well done, by the way.  Yes, very good.  Okay.  Oh, here you go.  Now, who's this there, Seth?  Look at that.  That's Mary Jean.  Mary Jean and that booty.  Here we go.  Who's his friend?  Mary Jean.  Yeah, the exotic one.  I think they've made each other's acquaintance.  I think so.  Is my wife sleeping?  Oh, you better hope so.  What bad bitch?  You should fucking put that pillow over her face in the morning.  I know.  Push down.  Oh, Patty.  Patty, relax. 
[03:18:00]  You're going to feel so good.  Jesus Christ.  I heard that before.  Oh, I see.  I wish I was going to just get Bobo.  Christ.  Come out.  Come out.  Oh, my God.  It's like trying to move an old person.  I know, right?  It's like she's trying to get her out of the tub.  Welcome to the nursing home again.  It's like a dead body.  It's all dead.  Wait, what?  I know.  What's the matter?  She's scared of the titties.  I have arthritis of the neck.  Her arthritis.  Keeping her from enjoying a lap down. 
[03:18:30]  Be careful.  I have arthritis of the neck.  How did she get arthritis of the neck?  Patty.  Mary Jean is disappointed in Patty.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's not happy.  So is Patty's family.  I'm not a goer.  First of all, these girls really are very hot.  They're very hot, yes.  A lot of guys would love to be in your position right now, Patty.  Really, Patty?  Yeah.  And three of them are here.  Holy shit.  You don't seem very relaxed.  Look at her tearing up that Macaulay Culkin body of hers. 
[03:19:00]  There's gymnastics going on.  It looks like she just flipped over and put her ass right in Patty's face.  That really hurts.  She's leaving for Sushi tomorrow.  Patty's sibilance.  Patty, how's your neck?  Call her.  Yeah, Patty.  That's all right.  How do you sit in there?  She's slamming across the face with her boobs.  You take some ibuprofen, you'll be fine.  Don't worry about it.  She's shaking her boobs. 
[03:19:30]  Oh, yeah.  She's got her.  Patty, open your eyes.  You're like, Patty, enjoy this.  Yeah, why aren't you enjoying this?  It's a pussy.  I don't know why anyone wants to see this.  It's like, it's like, do you ever see that movie with Helen Hunt and the guy who couldn't move from the neck down?  This is what it's happening.  Oh, yeah.  I sleep with that every night.  Wow, Patty, you're getting a good dance there.  She's dying.  Mary Jean's fucking rocking. 
[03:20:00]  Nice slamming body.  Look at this.  Get that pussy.  Patty, open your goddamn eyes.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  Look at that mouth.  Don't make us get the fucking clockwork orange eye clamps.  She's like getting raped.  I know.  It is.  It's starting to feel uncomfortable.  Yes, yes.  I feel like we're doing something wrong here.  This is, uh, you think?  I like that. 
[03:20:30]  No.  If only we had a pinball machine.  I feel like she's been broken and now she's enjoying it more.  She's giving her the high one now.  She's helping your back.  Yes, you can.  She'll fix your lumbar.  Fuck her ass.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  I thought she was choking.  I thought she was choking.  She got a pasta.  Yeah.  She's got a pastry in her throat.  Patty, what do you think?  This is the best glass you'll ever get.  Yeah. 
[03:21:00]  Well, that's true.  It's the only in her face.  Well, she gets one more.  No, that's true.  Yeah.  Put that shit in her fucking face.  This is great.  This is like that scene in, um, in Deathwitch.  This is like the apartment scene in Deathwitch.  Oh, Patty.  That was good.  How's Patty's neck?  Patty, how's your neck doing?  Arthritis.  How's that arthritic neck?  It's okay.  It's okay.  It's okay.  Yeah.  Patty, I feel like I have to ask, like, are you, like, can you handle one more? 
[03:21:30]  Yeah.  Are you all right, Patty?  Oh, no.  But you're the judge.  One more.  She said, wait.  How about if they don't?  I'm worried if there's people singing it.  I don't want to be singing it.  Oh, no.  Oh, no, no.  But you've already gone, too, now.  Believe you me, nobody's watching this.  Do you know what's on the internet?  Anybody can go on YouTube and see this if it goes on Opie's Daily Mofos.  Patty, do you understand this video of you all over the internet? 
[03:22:00]  Who did?  This video of you naked with a Krusty the Clown mask on.  Is that true?  Yeah.  Crawling on all four through mousetraps.  Why would you do that, but not this?  You know what the problem is?  I think Bobo would enjoy it more.  I don't know why he's not getting a laugh.  Yeah, they've suffered enough.  Yeah, yes.  Sorry.  I would appreciate it.  But maybe Lady Di.  Uh-oh.  Oh, yeah.  Lady Di.  Oh.  Lady Di.  Oh. 
[03:22:30]  Bobo.  Oh, yeah, sure.  All right, what do we got now, there?  How about Mike Puschetti getting a laugh?  Mike!  Yeah, get Mike Puschetti.  Get down there, Mike.  Get down.  Yeah.  Come on.  We'd appreciate it.  Come on, Mike.  You won't know which ones to share.  All right, climb aboard.  It's Lexi's turn.  Lexi, you're ready?  Get that white girl in.  Oh, Lexi.  White girl time. 
[03:23:00]  White girl time.  Lexi.  Oh, man.  All right, Bobo, we know.  She's reached the base camp.  All right.  Mike, you all right?  A little run in her stocking.  I saw that.  Wow.  What?  What the hell did he just try to say?  I don't know.  That's amazing.  Did you say you're in a relationship?  No, no, no, no. 
[03:23:30]  Oh, no.  No, no.  No, never.  He admits.  Yeah.  He said something about her being out of his league.  Oh, wait a minute.  No one's out of his league.  Oh, my God.  Please don't lick.  Please don't lick, Mike.  Please don't lick, Mike.  What was that?  Please don't lick.  Mike.  What's with the tongue?  He's very scared that the chair was gone.  Wow, she climbed him.  She's all up on top of that chair.  It is more fun to watch when someone's having fun getting it.  Yeah, yeah.  Look at that.  Oh, that's good.  She's doing so good, Bobo's getting hard. 
[03:24:00]  He's leading them to take his picture.  That's very, how is that?  You like it?  I just thought I didn't want to have you.  Oh, well.  It smells like it.  I don't think you can get up there that quick.  This is the normal.  All right.  Oh, God.  I thought it was the police.  All right.  She's doing a great job. 
[03:24:30]  A little lap dance action.  Now she's dancing in front of him, sticking her ass in his face a little bit.  Shaking that ass.  Yeah, shake that money mega.  Rubbing it on his belly.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Make that rain, honey.  Oh, yeah.  My daughter.  I know three people that are going to reevaluate their careers.  Yes.  I'm making rain shorts.  Oh.  Am I one of them?  No.  I am.  Oh, she's grinding. 
[03:25:00]  Look at that.  She's grinding against, you know, moves like that will give you neck arthritis.  You've got to watch your neck.  I've got neck arthritis.  That's right.  In time that could happen, I hear.  All right.  She's rubbing.  Oh, she's like, he's laying down in the chair.  She's got a knee firmly planted in his ball sack.  And another one on his hips.  And now she's grinding.  Her tits are eye level.  Now she's turned around.  Her feet are up on his thighs. 
[03:25:30]  Oh, that's a good move right there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's good.  When you see this group, you wonder, who's giving what disease to who?  Oh, yeah.  You know what I mean?  Like, who's the carrier?  That's good.  Who's the receiver?  Thank God.  It's a whole room of patient zeroes.  All right.  With the episodes on zeroes.  I'm waiting for Justin Hoffman and Rene Russo to walk in.  Yes, in there, her fucking safety suits.  Hey, what happened?  That was it.  She's giving him rats.  That was it.  She's giving her hepatitis.  Nice.  It's a match made in heaven. 
[03:26:00]  Mike, what did you think of that?  Mike, get on, Mike.  Look at his sweat.  Look at the gravy drip down his face.  Right now, my neck is on fire, actually.  Whoa.  He's got a neck problem here today.  Jesus.  Mike, it's terrific.  He enjoys a good laugh.  Other parts of the body will match your neck and be on fire and stretching and itching and  require medical attention.  Oh, God.  Wow.  Mike, can you spell your last name again for the people?  P-O-C-C-H-E-T-P-I. 
[03:26:30]  Okay, good.  Yeah, there you go.  All right.  And, uh...  Oh, God.  It was amazing.  It was amazing.  Good job, ladies.  Good job, ladies.  Now, it's gonna be hard to, uh...  Oh, yeah, it is.  I think all three of them should give Mike a lap dance.  Oh, man.  All three at once.  I don't know if he...  All three at once.  Wow.  Do you have a medic on staff?  You know what?  How about all three at once, Mike?  Yeah!  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  He's into this now.  No, no.  That's how we'll figure out a winner.  That's how we figure out a winner.  That's how we figure out a winner.  No, no. 
[03:27:00]  No, no.  No, no.  No, no.  No, no.  No, no.  No, no.  No, no.  No, no.  No, no.  Something tells me...  All three at once.  Polly has.  What's that?  Every time.  Well, Denny, you got a good song for the super lap dance.  Yeah, this is a super lap dance for the super show.  Patty, you fuddy-duddy.  Look at you.  How's your neck, Patty?  How's that neck?  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hold on, hold on.  I got to get on here. 
[03:27:30]  I know a doctor from Al-Qaeda that could fix it.  Sure.  Is his name Dr. McGill?  Rich is telling Anthony an idea.  Much too late.  What happened?  Well, he wanted to switch, pull the switch-a-roo, but...  On mic.  Oh.  Yeah.  He would know when he reaches for an ass and it's...  When he slips a disc.  Yeah.  He's like, how did you get a Buick up here?  All right, let's do it.  The super lap dance.  Oh, shit.  Triple? 
[03:28:00]  No way.  Yeah.  Three girls.  No waiting.  All right, ladies.  Step right up and climb aboard.  All right.  They're all dancing around them.  There it is.  Grab a arm.  Mary Jean just jumped right up on him.  She's...  Wow.  She's like standing.  They're standing on him.  This is amazing.  I've never seen this ever.  Like three bitches.  All right. </pre>
