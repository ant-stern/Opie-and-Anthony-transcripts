<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a focus on their "WOW" contest, lamenting Sacramento's losing streak due to a perceived lack of exceptionally attractive contestants.  The hosts heavily criticized Black Earl, a show employee, for his consistent tardiness and unprofessional conduct at "WOW sticker stop" promotional events, recounting listener encounters detailing Earl's problematic behavior.  This led to a discussion, fueled by listener calls, about the perils and humor of homemade sex tapes,  exploring the potential for embarrassment and the risk of exposure.  The hosts teased upcoming segments about J-Lo, Chelsea Clinton, Gary Coleman, and a Penthouse article by Rich Voss.  Vulgar and sexually suggestive language was pervasive throughout this segment.

The show then transitioned into a deeper exploration of sex tapes, childhood snooping, and the "WOW" contest. Opie shared graphic details about discovering his father's condoms and nude photos of his father's girlfriend as a child, and recounted a sexually suggestive encounter with a friend at age 13. Anthony described receiving a sex tape from his father.  Numerous callers, including Stefan, John, Mike, and Keith the Cop, shared their own experiences with discovering hidden sex-related materials in their parents' homes, resulting in humorous and sometimes shocking anecdotes. The segment concluded with discussion of the latest "WOW" contestant, a "hot blonde" from New York.

The next segment featured a detailed account of a "WOW" contest photoshoot with a blonde contestant.  Rick, a crew member, took over 110 progressively more revealing photos over 20 minutes, incorporating water to alter her appearance. This was followed by a disturbing segment where the hosts encouraged underage listeners to call in and describe items they had snooped out in their parents' bedrooms. Children detailed finding various sex toys, adult magazines (Playboy, Penthouse), condoms, lingerie, birth control pills, and even animal pornography. One parent called to express concern about their child being on hold. The segment concluded with further discussion of the "WOW" contestant's photos.

The show continued with the in-studio conclusion of the "WOW" contest photoshoot with contestant Corinne, a 30-year-old dancer.  The hosts discussed the explicit photos and their upcoming online release.  This transitioned into more calls from underage listeners detailing their snooping experiences, followed by a conversation with professional wrestling commentator Don West.  West discussed his upcoming work, including a lingerie battle royal, and demonstrated his infomercial style by selling Tiger Woods rookie cards. More calls from children detailing their snooping experiences followed. The segment concluded with a lengthy discussion of photos of an apparently intoxicated Chelsea Clinton in a London nightclub, with the hosts speculating on her drinking habits and the Clintons' reactions.  The hosts also shared personal anecdotes about their own experiences with extreme intoxication. A brief call from a listener in Sacramento touched on the "WOW" contest and the show's listener base.

The final segment delved into graphic accounts of sexual encounters with unconscious partners, fueled by listener calls and the hosts’ own commentary.  Callers shared experiences and debated the morality of such actions using explicit language. The segment included promotion of the "WOW" contest, showcasing photos of female contestants, and numerous advertisements for various products and services, including a call to action urging listeners to lobby their legislators about New Jersey corporate tax laws.  The show concluded with a “What We Learned” segment featuring humorous, often crude, anecdotes from callers, followed by continued discussion and display of photos from the “WOW” contest.

[00:05:30]  What a patriotic moment that was. 
[00:06:00]  We're going to be like... 
[00:06:30]  Is that supposed to be sexy?  Now, you don't like quinnis?  So what do you say?  He was banging cocktail waitresses.  Who would it take?  Tens Mike Snyder.  Tens Mike Snyder.  We got whores on the city.  We need backup now. 
[00:07:00]  I hope this isn't out of line, but you do have beautiful breasts.  You don't want to get me all started up over here, because everybody's got...  You don't want to ask me to say remember back then.  You don't want to ask me to say remember back then. 
[00:07:30]  No, my brother.  You got to find your home.  When men did things the way men did things, not then, when men were dinosaurs.  You hear?  I hear me.  I...  Hey, welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  It is Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Hola.  A couple phone numbers in the New York City area.  877-692-1027. 
[00:08:00]  And what a beautiful day in New York City today, man.  Yes.  We had to kind of do the...  You know, the stroll down the street today to check out all the fine ladies.  Oh, the ass.  Oh, there's so much ass in New York City.  Well, the ass.  It's not even funny.  When they start pulling the clothes off, because it's nice out.  It's ridiculous.  Ridiculous.  With their beautiful cans, trying to make me look ridiculous.  All right.  So, 877-692-10274, the New York area.  Outside of New York City, including... 
[00:08:30]  Yes, yes, yes.  Boston, yes.  Of course, Boston.  Thank you, Boston.  Thank you.  A little trend came out today, and we're doing just fine in Boston.  People in Boston digging the show.  And we deal with you.  So, if you're in Boston or anywhere else outside of New York City, 866-277-4WOW.  We're going to do a lot of WOW festivities today, I think.  WOW festivities?  I think we're going to hear from a lot of ladies that are WOWing today.  Good.  Good.  Why not?  Any girls want to call in during their WOWings? 
[00:09:00]  That's always good.  You know, if you're driving down the street, you've got a carload of gals.  Maybe you're a guy, and you've got your chick with you.  Maybe just a couple of girls driving around.  Nice day.  Got the top down or something.  And you see somebody with a WOW sticker on the car?  You want to give us a call before you give them the boobage?  Feel free.  And you've got to be in it to win it.  So you've got to get a WOW on your car.  In it to win it?  I don't know.  So, if you don't have a WOW sticker, you can make a homemade WOW sticker.  Right.  We like that as well, okay? 
[00:09:30]  Anything works as long as it has WOW on it.  And, Anthony, this just in?  Yes, yes.  Black Earl is back doing the WOW sticker stop.  Ah.  Black Earl is back doing the WOW sticker stop.  Now, how did that happen?  What are the odds that Earl will quit once again today?  Well, he's quit every single time he has done a sticker stop.  Because there's always a problem.  Always a problem.  He either gets there five minutes before it's supposed to end. 
[00:10:00]  He gets lost.  We get phone calls from listeners saying how nasty he is to the listeners.  How somebody asks him for two stickers and he only gives them one.  We have listeners call because they catch Earl in a lie.  Right.  Earl will be like, oh, dude, I'm almost there.  I'm almost in Jersey.  Yeah.  Like, he's supposed to be in, like, you know, South Jersey.  And a listener is right behind the van, you know, as Earl's on the George Washington Bridge.  Like, guys, I'm right behind Earl right now. 
[00:10:30]  He's nowhere near the sticker stop.  He's a liar.  It's going to take him at least an hour, man.  It's bumper-to-bumper traffic.  I don't know why he's telling you he's almost there.  I'm right behind him.  Some more adventures with Earl.  He's giving me the finger as I speak to you on the radio, dude.  So, Black Earl is back doing the WOW sticker stop.  Nice to have him back.  What happened?  There just wasn't enough heat on the sticker stops and we had to go back to Earl?  Well, you know, I mean, we just had, like, promotion guys there.  And you remember past years when Earl and Mark would go, it would just be hundreds of people.  But Earl, you know, had a big problem with this. 
[00:11:00]  Even though, you know, what a great assignment.  It's a beautiful day.  Earl goes in hands on stairs.  He didn't want to do it.  You know, he's all pissed off.  If you remember, Earl left this program a couple of months ago.  Remember?  He said that was it.  It was over.  But then, without any fanfare or really noticing, he kind of worked his way right back onto the show.  He pulled himself back in.  Back in.  He did.  Who will?  You know why?  Because you and I are a bunch of pussies.  No one ever officially leaves this show.  No. 
[00:11:30]  Who are you kidding?  It's true.  We try to have a little fun with it, but it seems like no one ever leaves.  Mm-hmm.  We try.  They just keep coming back like a bad rash.  But this was on Earl's accord.  Earl said, you know, that's it.  I don't like the way I'm being treated on the show, and I'm leaving.  Right.  And then, all of a sudden, he's back.  He left because of the famous tape.  Oh, that's right.  Yes.  The famous tape where we made him interview one of our interns.  Potential intern.  And we told the intern to mess with Earl, and we got some great audio, and we were never able to put it on our radio show. 
[00:12:00]  And Earl quit over that.  But Earl's back doing the sticker stops.  He's going to be at Kawasaki Sports Center starting at 4 o'clock today.  Ha ha!  Kawasaki Sports Center is located at 566 Route 23 North, Tompton Plains, New Jersey.  All right.  Now, I'm...  566 Route 23 North.  What time would he have to leave here to get there?  Hey, he said he was going to leave early.  Did he?  And I think he did leave early.  Is he still here?  I think I just saw him, too. 
[00:12:30]  Is Earl still here?  No?  Did he leave?  He's out, right?  He's going to make it.  He's going to make it.  Keep your fingers crossed.  Stay tuned.  So, if you need a WOW sticker stop, Kawasaki Sports Center from 4 to 5.  566 Route 23 North in Pumpton Plains, New Jersey.  Right.  What's up, Pumpton Plains?  Anthony, speaking of WOW, I've got an announcement to make.  Mm-hmm.  The Sacramento hitting streak is over.  You know...  We keep wondering why...  Sacramento's hot streak is over. 
[00:13:00]  We get less and less girls for these kinds of...  Sacramento's hot streak is over.  Oh, my God.  Wow, someone else is saying it.  Dude, I'm not the only one.  Are you kidding?  It was before I said it.  It was before I said it?  It was.  Chris from Sacramento.  He just writes, Sacramento ringers...  And then he writes, the streak is over.  The streak is over. 
[00:13:30]  I'm looking right now.  And, um...  The Sacramento hot streak is over.  I was saying in the office, I feel like...  It's good to see they have normal girls in Sacramento, just like we have in our fine city and the city you're listening from.  I feel like that day...  I really thought there was something in the water in Sacramento, but the hot streak is over.  It's over.  Remember that one?  Ripken's streak of all those consecutive games ended.  Remember that empty feeling you had when he just decided to sit down one day? 
[00:14:00]  Sit down one day.  That's how I feel now.  That's how I feel.  Uh, Sacramento's the latest contestant.  Sacramento is not invincible anymore, Anthony.  No.  Kind of like, you know, the other night when Tyson just got the S beat out of him.  Yeah.  I'm kind of feeling like, oh, wow.  You know?  They're just not as strong anymore.  I thought, yeah, Sacramento was just a land of babes.  We really thought there was something in the water, you know? 
[00:14:30]  They were pulling a fast one on us over there, the KXOA.  Right.  Well, the hot streak is over.  I'm not the only one saying it.  I am not the bad guy this time around.  And we welcome our newest contestant.  Yes, we do.  Of course.  Want to say hi to our latest contestant in the WOW contest?  Go to opianthony.com to check out all the contestants thus far.  We're still qualifying, ladies.  Ladies, all you have to do is show up at the station.  They take your pictures, and then they send the pictures off to us.  We'll put them up on opianthony.com, and eventually the listeners will vote to see who wins $5,000, courtesy of risquevideo.com. 
[00:15:00]  Look at Dan from Hoboken saying, what do you mean no one ever leaves the show?  Didn't Dan leave the show?  Not really.  Not really.  See, with his instant feedback, he's still part of the show.  Yes, he is.  All right.  So there you have it, Anthony.  Yeah.  Is someone goofing on my voice, saying I sound like Gene Simmons selling those effing coffin coolers? 
[00:15:30]  Well, your voice is still shot.  It is so shot.  I apologize to the listening audience.  We have a Popeye bit that we can't wait to do.  We'll have to wait another day or two, though.  It's okay.  Imagine how funny that would be.  Hold on.  We got the first Earl report?  Come on.  There's no way.  Tony.  Yeah, how you doing?  What's up?  You got to be lying.  No, I'm not lying.  And I'm on Route 3.  Yeah.  And I just saw a black girl just passed ahead of me.  I gave him a little beep.  Who's the white guy driving? 
[00:16:00]  He gave me the Hawaiian.  Oh, sorry.  Sorry.  Oh, hey, oh.  We're in a lot of traffic on Route 3.  There you go.  Okay.  So I don't know if we'll make it or not, because I live right off Route 23.  Everyone's reporting that they're all stuck in traffic.  So he might not make it.  All right.  How you doing, guys?  He'll make it.  All right.  Punch it out.  Another report.  They love messing with Earl.  Go ahead, Nick.  All right.  Yeah.  I'm on Route 3 right now. 
[00:16:30]  We're coming back from the Newark Fairs game.  Me and my buddy Rocco.  Yeah.  The van's two cars behind us, and it ain't going anywhere.  You think he's going to make it by four?  No.  Because this traffic is going to carry all the way up 46 onto 23.  He ain't making it.  All right, Nick.  Thank you.  No problem.  Bye.  Oh, Frank from Manhattan is saying the newest contestant from KXOA, the Buster Douglas of Sacramento.  Buster Douglas had one good fight. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, but that's the one that ended Tyson's streak.  Oh, I see.  Buster Douglas.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm slow.  Very good.  The hot streak in Sacramento is over.  Oh.  And I'm very happy I can announce this today.  All right, Joe.  What's going on?  Not much, man.  Yo.  I just wanted to talk about freaking Lady Di yesterday.  Oh, boy.  We're going to try to move on a little bit from Lady Di.  Yeah, stop.  All right.  All right.  But what do you want to say?  The poll is up on opianthony.com.  Should she stay or should she go?  We will tell you this much. 
[00:17:30]  We do have one other thing we want to do with Lady Di before the final decision is made.  Kill her?  And that might take another week to set up.  So go ahead, Joe.  I just wanted you guys to know that Captain Nemo is looking for the, you know, the bitch that attacked his tub.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Joe?  Yeah.  All right, Joe.  Thank you.  Good try, Joe.  Just saying.  Look how disappointed Joe sounds.  Don't worry about it, guys.  You sound all uncomfortable, man.  He's feeling uncomfortable. 
[00:18:00]  He doesn't know how to get out of it.  At least I didn't trill up like the guy yesterday or cough or anything.  That's true.  He was confident.  But now you have to awkwardly hang up the phone and stuff.  That's always uncomfortable to hear.  After a flop like that.  Don't worry about it.  All right, Joe.  All right, guys.  Okay.  Here it goes.  Earl is cruising at five miles per hour.  Hey, Earl.  Hey, you.  What's up, Earl?  I can barely hear you guys here, but we're causing a little bit of trance. 
[00:18:30]  The man's phone is back.  God damn.  I feel like I got in the time machine.  I hope the new cities can appreciate the silliness of Earl.  It's always the same thing.  I can barely hear you guys.  The phone's bad.  Wait until he gets to the sticker stop in here.  This is how his phone works.  Guys!  Guys!  I'm Earl!  I'm Earl!  Earl!  Earl, back off the phone.  I can't see you.  Yeah.  There's so many people. 
[00:19:00]  What?  Then we ask too many questions that he goes, well, well, why don't you just do it yourself?  I quit.  This is the last sticker stop I'm doing.  God, I love it.  I quit.  I love that Earl's back doing this.  All right, Earl.  Yo.  Hey, what's up?  You son's a bitch.  All right.  Can you hear us?  Yeah, he's just fine.  Are you feeling good today?  I feel pretty good.  Nothing wrong with you today?  There's nothing wrong with me today.  All right.  There's usually something wrong with you as well. 
[00:19:30]  All right.  What's up, Earl?  Well, everyone's saying we're stuck in traffic.  Yeah, there's a minor backup, but nothing major.  Minor backup.  Okay.  We will be there by 4 o'clock.  Well, Earl, I said all that already.  Earl.  Earl.  Yeah.  You're going to have just a little more energy when you get to the sticker stop?  I have energy now.  I'm fine.  All right.  You might want to get an energy drink in you, okay? 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  I'm not on my phone.  I swear, I can barely hear you.  I'm using Matt's phone.  I could get tape from a year ago.  You say the same stuff.  No, I'm not on my phone.  This is great.  I know.  We'll be there at 4, and we've got a couple surprises for everyone who shows up.  Oh.  Oh.  Earl, doing some material for the show?  A little mystery there.  What is it, Earl?  No, we just got stuff for the ladies that they decide to show up in the wild. 
[00:20:30]  What kind of stuff, Earl?  We got the wild baby tees for the ladies.  The baby tees.  How hot are those baby tees looking on most girls?  They are awesome.  They are awesome.  It's tough.  All right, Earl.  I've got to go.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Shut up, man.  I mean, the wives.  I know.  I, you know, I've just, you know, seen things. 
[00:21:00]  You know, we give them out at some of the events and whatnot, and some people will walk  around with them.  Maybe shouldn't.  That's not what I'm saying.  Well, the wild baby tees is very popular.  It's just like anything else.  Some girls should be ordering the baby Shamu tees, but others look fine in the baby tees.  Yeah.  The baby got back tees.  Stop, man.  What?  It's just like, you know.  This is why the ladies hate us. 
[00:21:30]  No, it isn't, because I'll make the same analogy when you see a guy walking down the beach with  those yam bag bathing suits.  You know?  You know, you shouldn't be wearing them either.  Just saying.  There are certain things that should be worn by certain people.  You ever go to the beach and see the girls wearing the thongs?  And they shouldn't be?  So, Ant?  Yes, yes.  Who shouldn't be wearing the wild baby tees?  Oh!  Well, anybody.  Well, you know something?  Who am I to say? 
[00:22:00]  If you have the self-confidence.  If you're feeling confident about that kind of thing.  Why would you say something like that today?  I think you're showing a lot of confidence.  What?  Why would you say something like that today?  I don't know.  I just brought it up.  Why?  Is there an awkward situation going on that I don't know about?  I...  Maybe.  I don't know.  Because I'm just talking.  All right.  I didn't see nothing.  Really?  All right.  Let me go to Ken.  Hey, Ken.  You're on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Yeah, I got three words for Sacramento. 
[00:22:30]  All right.  It's over, Johnny.  I just love that the hot streak in Sacramento is over, man.  They had a great run, though, didn't they?  They had a great run.  Everything valid steps up.  There's not enough filters in the world to help that situation.  Everything Sacramento threw at us was a babe.  Right.  And then, well, we have June 19th, 2002.  Making us all feel unworthy in these other cities.  June 19th, I'm like 9-11.  All right, Ken.  Thank you.  Bye. 
[00:23:00]  Bye.  There's some pretty good ones, though.  Who is some new contestants that weren't up yesterday?  Well, the girl from Dallas, her pictures went up there late yesterday.  How's the one from D.C.?  I'm just trying to get that up.  She's not bad at all.  The latest girl from D.C. is nice, too.  Yeah.  You know, we talk about the hot ones as well, Anthony.  She's got a little Asian in her.  Is that what I'm seeing?  Oh, yeah?  Let me see.  Would she like a little Polish in her?  Yeah. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, no, no.  That's good.  I like her.  She looks like, what's her name from the view?  A little bit.  And she also looks like...  Sir Jones?  She also looks like she'd be related to Tilly.  Oh, yeah.  She looks like a Tilly sister.  She's got a little Tilly in her.  Like a Meg Tilly or a other girl Tilly.  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  So, we've got a lot going on.  And WOW is happening all over the ball field. 
[00:24:00]  We've got the WOW contest, which is nice.  Hopefully, some ladies will show up at the stations today to get their pictures done.  Go to opianthony.com for the contestants and the rules of the contest.  $5,000 up for grabs, courtesy of risquevideo.com.  Okay?  Right.  Are you puzzled, Anthony?  No.  No.  Not at all.  Are we still on the baby team thing?  No.  We're going to try to move on.  Okay.  All right.  Wow.  I have to go here for a second.  Alexis. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  Go ahead, Alexis.  Oh, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  Yo, I'm on Route 3.  I don't want to go in anywhere.  There's a backup for like a mile.  I'm trying to run away from my boss.  Okay.  Which one we call it?  They should call them joints baby back rib tees, because some of these chicks should not be wearing  these joints, especially the ones you handed out in Newark.  And I think the girls from Sacramento shipped in some ringers from Cleveland from last year.  Some ugly fat bitches.  All right.  Let's not make fun of Cleveland today.  What?  The Rosie O'Donnell look-alike contest?  I think they stopped it wrong or something.  All right.  Thank you, Alexis. 
[00:25:00]  See you, fellas.  This is going to be one of those little city wars happening today.  I can feel it.  I know.  See what happens.  Every while, the cities explode and fight each other.  That's what happened with Dallas.  It's brewing right now.  Dallas jumped all over, uh, what?  Cleveland.  Dallas jumped all over Cleveland yesterday, yes.  And now everyone's beating up on Sacramento today.  Who thought we'd see the day?  After the last contest we had with the girls from Sacramento?  The Naughty Ninety Contest?  You could take every girl from Sacramento in the last contest and put them on a calendar. 
[00:25:30]  And it would sell like crazy.  They were that hot.  And just when we'd get one and go, my God, this is the hottest girl ever, Sacramento would  send us more pictures.  Right.  But ladies and gentlemen, the streak is over.  The hot streak is over for Sacramento.  It was a good run, though.  It was a great run.  Check it out on opiananthony.com.  All right.  Anthony?  Yeah.  We're going to take a break.  And when we get back, the listeners are going to laugh at this, but we're going to get to 
[00:26:00]  all the stuff that we haven't gotten to.  In like four years?  Well, there's a lot of things we've teased on the show in the last at least month.  We've gotten a lot of flack for it.  That we never got to.  And we're going to give you guys the opportunity to help us catch up.  Right.  What are some of the things we said we would get to and we never got to?  Some of the things we said we were going to get to and we never got to.  And we never got to.  Now, you guys call us out on this all the time. 
[00:26:30]  The email is brutal.  People are like, what the F?  Why'd you spend an hour and a half with Lady Di yesterday?  You were supposed to talk about the J-Lo tape.  Right.  You were supposed to talk about Chelsea getting drunk.  What is wrong with you guys?  And that got us thinking that there's a lot of other things out there that we teased to  death and never got to.  We were talking about it in the office.  Excuse me.  Talking about it in the office and you brought up a great point.  You said that the stuff gets on the list of things we want to get to.  We put a list out.  A show stuff list. 
[00:27:00]  Here's the show stuff list for today.  Okay.  Really fast.  Wow.  Stick a stop with Earl.  Kawasaki Sports Center from 4 to 5, 566, Route 23 North, Pompton Plains, New Jersey.  Right.  So we took care of that.  That was something we wanted to talk about today.  We did it.  Right.  All right.  Here are some of the other things.  Well, the second bit down.  What bits have we forgotten to do?  What if we pushed that one down?  We just might.  Boy, how freaky.  That would be weird.  We want to talk about Sex for Sam tryouts.  Oh, yeah.  Okay. 
[00:27:30]  We want to talk about maybe putting a summer road show together.  Maybe a summer road show where the listeners decide exactly what they want to see at this  road show.  Okay.  The 5 o'clock fake-o and the 6 o'clock queef.  What happened to that?  They just kind of faded away.  Because we allowed it to.  You're right.  We let a lot of things just fade away.  We want to play the feather bit.  We're going to play that until break.  So we're good right now.  Okay. 
[00:28:00]  Voss has an article in Penthouse.  Oh.  Well, I've got to read it.  Rich Voss has an article in Penthouse.  We want to touch on that today.  We're thinking about doing an Ebonics game because of the appearance Tracy Morgan had  with us.  Some of the language that we just didn't understand.  Now, here's the stuff that used to be on the top of the list and is way down at the  bottom.  And ready to leave the list because we don't have any room left.  Chelsea Clinton drunk in Star Magazine.  Great story.  Coffee J.  Lowe sex tape in Inquirer. 
[00:28:30]  Mm-hmm.  Videotaping sex acts.  Remember that?  Remember we were going to hit on that whole thing.  We had phones burning that day that we touched on it.  Something happened.  And we're like, great.  Right after this, we'll talk to you guys if you had an embarrassing moment, you know,  filming yourself having sex and what happened to that tape.  Blah, blah, blah.  We get back from break and then we've wasted time on Stalker Patty or Lady Di.  Something came up.  So we're going to try to get to that.  If we don't get to it today, I think it's going to be dropped off the list, Anthony.  I know. 
[00:29:00]  All right.  And what are some of the other things we've teased and never got to?  That's where you can help us out.  Yeah.  Pete, a football story?  I don't remember that.  Oh, we had a bunch of politically correct things that we...  Yeah, geez, where did that go?  And now the whole list of them are gone.  Why do you still have a picture of Piazza with his shirt off and a bat?  Scrap paper.  You saved it for scrap paper?  Scrap paper!  It's scrap paper.  All of them are.  There's a pile of 80 of them.  I'll get a wallpaper in my room. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Here's Heather the Feather and a little thing that's Steve from foundrymusic.com.  But together, we'll continue.  Sure.  Dropping out of school to become a stripper seems like a fun thing to do.  Heather.  Hello.  What?  Hello.  Hi, Heather.  Hello.  So what do you want?  I want to come on the show again.  Ethel.  What?  Hello.  What?  I want to come on the show again.  No! 
[00:30:00]  Why?  Never?  Why not?  You're very boring, Heather.  What?  I'm boring?  Hello?  You're a certifiable lunatic.  What?  You are very, very, very annoying.  I'm annoying?  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  You guys don't like me?  You're a friggin' moron.  You're a stupid jerk.  You shut up.  Hello?  Hello?  What?  What?  You stupid bitch.  You are smarter than me, right?  Ooh!  Kiss my ass too, honey, because it's so sweet.  Yeah!  Yeah! 
[00:30:30]  What?  You whore!  You don't want me to come back to the show?  Is that what you're saying?  You're out of your mind.  Don't you listen to the show, whores or one-trick ponies?

[00:38:30]  My friends say I'm the most cynical guy they know.  The way I see it, I'm just naturally curious.  Take this new tire place I found, right?  Yeah.  Just Tires, the one that guarantees they'll install the tires you want in 30 minutes or less so you get 20 bucks back.  So I get to wondering how the Just Tires people measure up in the price department.  I do a little investigation on my own.  Wouldn't you know they've got guaranteed lowest prices, too? 
[00:39:00]  Some brands and sizes starting as low as $19.95.  Yep, for great tires, great selection, and great prices, I've got to say, it's Just Tires.  And that's a choice bit of information you can bet all my friends appreciate.  Hey, I might be a cynic, but I wouldn't steer you wrong.  Planning a summer road trip?

[00:40:30]  It's Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  A lot of reports of wowing coming in already.  Thank you, ladies.  Thank you very much for helping us out with the wow thing.  Earl has made it to the sticker stop, Anthony.  Stop it.  I'm telling you.  Earl.  Hello.  Earl.  Yeah, man.  Earl.  Yes.  You made it? 
[00:41:00]  We're here.  And why are you...  566 Route 23 North, Compton Plains, New Jersey, Kawasaki Sports Center.  We are here.  We're setting up, and we will be here until 5 o'clock.  Anyone there yet, Earl?  There's a couple of people here who have already busted my balls, yes.  Wow.  He made it that quick?  Well, congrats, Earl.  Wow.  Good job.  We don't know what to say to you.  You've never been here earlier before.  I'll give you a hint.  I wasn't driving. 
[00:41:30]  I know.  Yeah, that's obvious.  We know that.  So you're going to be giving out those baby tees today?  Yes.  For all the girls who want to show up and wow the road crew, Matt is particularly eager  to see girls today.  Oh, he is?  Yeah.  All right, Earl.  Anything else?  That's it.  You're at Kawasaki Sports Center.  We'll be here until 5.  Okay.  We'll break them.  Thank you, Earl.  All right.  Give us a little more time.  We'll break them. 
[00:42:00]  He sounds very in control.  He's very smooth.  Very relaxed.  What was he going to say?  Earl?  What were you going to yell?  Did you break?  You know how many times you have broken me?  Many times.  Yeah.  We enjoy doing that.  You all right, Earl?  I have nearly killed people at that radio station.  I have broken equipment.  Hey, relax.  I'm fine.  Sounds like you're getting a little upset.  Just a little. 
[00:42:30]  You all right?  Yeah, I'm fine.  All right.  We'll check in in a little while.  Be nice to the listeners.  Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm going to be a perfect gentleman.  They love you, Earl.  Yeah.  Okay?  Yeah, they love you guys.  Well, they love me.  All right, Earl.  Have fun handing out the wow stickers today, okay?  Yes.  All right.  I'll talk to you later.  We're looking forward to a big turnout down there.  Yeah, I mean, they're already starting to show up out of the woodwork.  Oh, really?  Yes.  Wow.  Okay.  You guys suck. 
[00:43:00]  Thank you, Earl.  Thank you, guys.  Have fun.  Bye.  Okay.  It's all about fun.  Here goes Earl.  We'll break him.  He'll quit.  He'll start screaming.  Steven, what's going on?  What's going on, man?  We never got to that Gary Coleman phone call.  Gary's still on hold.  I'm punching out. 
[00:43:30]  All right.  No, he really is.  Yeah.  Gary, you still there?  Yeah.  Yeah, there he was.  All right.  We'll get to him in a little bit.  I heard him.  A little old school for people.  Hey, Anthony, this is a rumor that there's a sex tape out there.  Right.  Are we actually getting to that?  But now they're saying that Suge Knight made the whole goddamn thing up.  Who are you believing?  Suge Knight.  Suge Knight.  You've got to stay in Suge's corner.  If Suge Knight says he made it up, then I believe him. 
[00:44:00]  He'll kill you.  But basically, there's a rumor that there's a J-Lo Puffy sex tape out there.  Yeah, apparently Puffy videotaped him and J-Lo having sex.  And he still has the tape.  And Puffy's friends let it be known that he has the tape.  And words spread through the tight-knit group of backup singers that this tape does exist.  And is this the reason why J-Lo broke up with her husband?  Yeah, apparently the husband couldn't take knowing that there is this sex tape of Puffy and J-Lo. 
[00:44:30]  And that's why he broke up with her.  But this is like something from her past if it's out there.  Don't matter.  Freaked him out.  The trick is, when the hell is the rest of us going to get to see it?  Because these things always surface.  Always surface.  There's no tape out there, my brother.  You don't think so?  No way.  It would have surfaced already. 
[00:45:00]  Now if Puffy still has it, if he's like showing people.  You think he shows people?  Yo, bring me some more bottles of Chrissy.  Smoking some herb, drinking the Chrissy.  Look at the ass on this.  She got ass on this.  Hat on backwards.  He's got his Hollywood friends out there in the Hamptons.  Regis Philbin.  Look at the ass on her.  That's amazing, Puffy.  You were tapping that Puffy while you?  Tapping that ass while you? 
[00:45:30]  Fabulous.  Well, now they're saying Suge Knight made the whole thing up, though.  Why would he do that?  To get back at Puffy?  Yeah.  Or J-Lo?  Who?  Both of them?  Yeah?  Yeah.  And this goes back to what we were saying.  There is no need, no reason, and only bad could come of videotaping yourself having sex.  What?  You got to videotape a what?  What is that?  Oh, I thought you had the videotape. 
[00:46:00]  I know.  Like, wow, you're good.  It's like, Ben, call the media.  You're good, Ben.  No, I guess, yeah, on FoundryMusic.com, Steve's got a clip of J-Lo doing a sex scene in a movie.  Is it graphic?  Wait, is that her boobs?  That really is her boobs?  What movie is this from?  Money Train.  Money Train?  Yeah?  She was topless in Money Train?  Here comes Steve with the explanation.  Steve always knows about nudity in cinema.  Steve, get over there.  It's not Money Train.  It's U-Turn.  Sorry about that. 
[00:46:30]  U-Turn?  Yeah, U-Turn, that Oliver Stone movie she did with Sean Penn a few years ago.  Yeah.  It's pretty graphic, though.  You see a lot.  Who's that tool in her?  Uh, is it Sean Penn?  I don't know.  All you can see is a hairy butt, and I don't know what Sean Penn's hairy butt looks like,  so.  Oh, well.  That's J-Lo's.  No, it's not.  No?  But, uh, yeah, she's getting railed pretty nicely.  You can check it out on FoundryMusic.com.  No, Ann, have you ever taped yourself? 
[00:47:00]  No.  I would never tape myself having sex.  The thing is, especially when camcorders first became available to the general population,  there's something you can do, and it's ridiculous when you finally, like, do it.  You could set up a camera and just have it monitored on a TV screen without taping it to see kind  of what it looks.  And it just, it looks silly and completely ridiculous. 
[00:47:30]  No, but isn't the point of taping yourself to watch it afterwards?  No.  You're too busy doing the thing, and you're going to be self-conscious of what you look  like.  Why would you, why would you want to look over and see what's going on on the screen?  No, no, because here's the misconception.  You, you would, you would tape something thinking, all right, when we're done, we can then watch  it and see how hot the smutty action was.  Truth of the matter is, once, uh, once you, uh, pop, as they say, what are you going to 
[00:48:00]  do?  Throw it in?  Now you feel ridiculous and silly.  You know how all worked up, you go, yeah, we'll tape ourselves.  This is going to be great.  You go, you go, you go, so goddamn hard, so good.  We're going to make our own porno.  I'm going to tape it.  Look at that.  Look, I'm taping this right now.  Look how that slug, Jesus Christ, I am just pounding you.  Yeah, you did that.  Let me pull your hair back, you bitch.  And then, you, you get done, you, um, you want, you want some water? 
[00:48:30]  I was going to say, you want to go out and get, get a burger or something?  What do you want?  Watch TV.  Because the last thing I think I want to watch is the videotape of us effing.  And because it's not, a lot of things seem very hot and exciting in the midst of all  that action, or beforehand.  And once you're done, you go pop it in and go, look at my yam bag smacking.  Oh, I didn't know.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I didn't know my ass looked like that. 
[00:49:00]  Right.  You know, like a world of hurt, depending on where the hell the camera's positioned.  And then you got, you got to play director because you know you're monitoring it as you're  doing it.  And then, because you've seen the homemade tapes, it's always, oh, oh, oh, oh.  And then look.  And you can tell they're not looking at the camera, they're looking at the monitor.  Wait, wait, lift your leg.  Go, no, do the, no, it's backwards.  Do the, this.  And then you're watching the tape with a pointer and going, hey, man, you should get  that, that right there checked out.  That looks malignant, sir. 
[00:49:30]  Perhaps you should have that taken care of.  And no one looks, the porno industry, they, they know things about shooting the stuff,  lighting, getting actors and actresses on there that aren't slobs.  They're good with angles.  Yeah.  And makeup.  And this is just.  And body doubles.  And this is the least important part of why you shouldn't videotape yourself.  Fluffers.  Yeah, you want to see yourself not able to perform on tape.  Imagine your, your ex or something get a hold of that one. 
[00:50:00]  Hey, look at Limpy over here.  He couldn't even get it going.  But again, this is just one part of it that might be bad.  The worst part of it is now it's documented.  It's on videotape.  For what?  So in time, it can fall into the wrong hands.  And by the wrong hands, I mean anyone else but yours.  Right.  And it's on the shelf with the rest of your videos and you're convinced like you'll always  know where it is.  Oh yeah.  I'll keep track of that one.  It's the one.  I'll just put a ripped piece of masking tape on there. 
[00:50:30]  No label, but I know ripped masking tape means porno.  And then before you know it, where's, where's ripped masking tape?  Oh my God.  I, I lent that to my sister.  You pop in ripped masking tape and it's your prom.  Right.  And, and the one labeled your prom, uh-oh.  Because you, you know how many videotapes you've gone through in your life.  I used to videotape everything.  TV shows. 
[00:51:00]  I had a camcorder.  So any event, band stuff.  I probably have 1% of all the videos I've shot in any way, shape or form.  Where are the rest?  You know something?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Are they destroyed?  Probably not.  They're probably sitting in a closet somewhere in a box, over at a friend's house.  Perhaps they got returned inadvertently to Blockbuster Video, which is always that good  one too.  When the guy dropped, remember the sheriff's, uh, it was a sheriff, had sex with his wife, 
[00:51:30]  videotaped it, and, um.  And put it in a Blockbuster box?  Yeah.  He accidentally put it in the Blockbuster box.  Dropped it off in the depository.  Right.  And they made copies of it.  It really happened, because they had copies of this thing, and they circulated it around  the town.  Here's the sheriff and his wife having sex.  And the sheriff noticed when he looked at what he thought was his porno movie, and it  was a movie that should have been returned to Blockbuster.  So it's always, it might always end up in the wrong hands.  Well, Chris, uh, is going to videotape his girlfriend tonight, I think. 
[00:52:00]  Chris, what's up?  Oh, Ant, stop.  You're killing it for me, man.  I just talked her into it, and she listens to you guys.  What did you talk her into it for?  Why, why not?  I don't want to do that.  Because it's fun.  But why, yeah, why do you want to film yourself having sex?  I don't, I don't get that turn on.  I get a lot of turn on, but not that one.  Yeah.  What's the deal with that?  Because it's something that I've never done.  I'm, it's like Captain Kirk, you know?  I'll be gone when no one's gone before.  It's something I haven't done.  So when are you going to watch this tape? 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  Oh, I don't know.  When I have my buddies over, all drunk.  Oh, that's the worst.  That is absolutely the worst thing you could possibly do.  Would you really show it to your buds?  Ah, well, I know she's listening, so I'm going to say no.  Oh.  Better than that, I'm ruthless.  All right.  Thanks, Chris.  Yeah, take it easy, guys.  I would never be able to show my pal to be having sex.  Hey, here I am.  Right, check it.  Look at.  Hey, guys, check me out.  Dude, honestly, how nice is my seat?  Right.  You know, what are you going to say to your bud? 
[00:53:00]  I learned this moving.  Nom, check it out.  Guys, does your left one hang lower, like, behind us?  Do you got one that looks like that?  I hope so.  You notice I shave.  What, yours doesn't lean way to the left?  What?  Oh, like I'm the only one?  I'm the freak here?  Right.  There's no reason for it.  You're just setting yourself up for trouble.  What do you mean it's not proportional?  I thought I was fine. 
[00:53:30]  Hey, John, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Pretty good.  I made a tape with my wife.  We started the tape.  It was going really, really nice.  It had some music in the background.  The door was locked.  It was the morning.  All of a sudden, my four-year-old knocks on the door.  He was like, go away.  Go play.  Do something.  So he gets his Winnie the Pooh magnadoodle and decides to sit outside the door and play  with his magnadoodle.  I'm like, no big deal.  He's drawing, right? 
[00:54:00]  Well, this particular magnadoodle makes noises.  Yeah.  Okay, so we're right in the middle of the deed, and all of a sudden, I hear, boop, boop, boop.  And I hear, boink, boink.  And this thing, with every noise this thing made, with every freaking noise this thing  made, I lost that much more wood.  It turned up on the tape.  And it's a blooper tape.  That's classic.  That's the one and only time we ever tried to do it.  I mean, it started out okay, but then when we watched it afterwards, it was just, it was  comedy.  It wasn't anything that turned us on or anything like that. 
[00:54:30]  Boing.  Yeah, it was just, I mean, think about it.  You know, you're trying to put on the face for the camera.  You know the face, right?  Yeah.  And all of a sudden, you hear, boop, boop, boop.  And you know what's Winnie the Pooh, and you know what he's doing.  He's pressing Winnie the Pooh's belly.  And you start thinking, oh, how cute my kid is.  But why did you guys want to tape yourselves having sex?  It was just one of those things.  You know, we got the stupid camcorder.  I have the tripod.  I think, all right, let's try it, you know.  Yeah.  And you know, one angle, you know, half the shots of my big, big white ass, you know. 
[00:55:00]  Big deal.  Got pimples all over it.  Yeah, well, what happened was, you know, we kept it for comic relief for a while, and  we just, I just, you know, tore the tape out of it and threw it out.  Yeah.  All right.  But it was just, it was really like, oh my God, it was the funniest thing I ever saw.  Right on.  Thanks, John.  Talk to you later.  Okay.  Look at this guy.  If you want your friends to see your F face, you are gay.  You know, you don't, you make the face, and it doesn't look like it does in the movies.  Make a face, you look like a stroke victim. 
[00:55:30]  Drooling.  Snorting.  Just disgusting.  No one looks good at the moment.  No one looks good.  Especially, not even at the moment, right before.  You ever get a lock jaw because you were like clenching too much?  Ow.  Oh no, is my jaw going to stay in this position?  To blow a big snot out your nostril, you're breathing heavy through your nose.  Arr, arr, like a rutting pig. 
[00:56:00]  I once pulled a muscle in my ear.  Like, what is that?  Stefan.  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  What do you got to add to this?  Hey, think about this for a second.  You wouldn't want to videotape yourself.  You'd have actual running time on the event.  Yeah, how long it's done.  I mean, how disappointing would that be?  Well, it better be one of your banner evenings, you know what I mean?  Yeah, you're watching the tape backing on, what do you mean four and a half minutes?  Yeah, you're like, that was half an hour.  That counter is wrong, man.  Wait, what about floor play?  Does that count?  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, you just see it go from the zero, zero, zero. 
[00:56:30]  It's like 2.35 and you're done.  That's embarrassing.  All right, Stefan.  All right, take care.  Bye.  Hey, Mike, what's going on?  Hey, man.  Actually, a long time ago, my dad...  I found a videotape that I made with my ex-girlfriend and actually brought it to my house to see  if I actually wanted it back.  Did he watch it?  He told me he did.  Of course he did.  That's my boy.  Yeah.  There's my boy. 
[00:57:00]  Were you good in the tape?  You know, I did watch it myself again before I destroyed it, and it looked too bad.  Well, how was your performance on a scale of one to ten?  It could have been a little longer.  All right, thanks, bro.  All right, man.  Bye.  My father, when I was out in California, lived with my father, I was about 12.  Oh, no.  Another father story.  I know.  They're all just the sickest things.  Oh, God.  But he was with this girl, Corey.  He was with her, and apparently... 
[00:57:30]  Was she friends with Buzz?  Yeah, they were all friends.  All friends together.  I think he lived in a hippie commune.  Actually, it was very equestrian, cowboy-like.  Whatever he wants to call it.  And Corey had taken these black-and-white, artsy nudes of herself, had them taken or something.  This was before she met my father, I guess.  And they were in the night table drawer next to their bed, you know, as I was snooping around one day looking. 
[00:58:00]  You know, because you do that.  You ever do that?  You snoop around with your parents?  You just snoop all over the place.  When I was a kid, always, always just snooping around.  And then you find some really, like, stuff that just disgusts you.  You know what I learned about my dad?  He never had porno magazines around.  Never?  Because when I was in, like, junior high, I had a friend, John McCullough.  I don't even know what ever happened to this guy.  And, like, his father had the Playboys right next to the bed.  Yeah.  And we'd go over to his house, seventh grade or something, and he goes, let me show you something. 
[00:58:30]  And he would show me where his father's stash was.  Oh, it's right here.  So I'm thinking, well, if John's father has a porno stash, my dad certainly has to have one, too.  The search is underway.  And I searched up and down, never found anything.  Rip it down walls.  Oh, without it.  I searched everywhere.  Ransack the place.  Because I'm thinking, you know, maybe I don't have to go to John's house to see the porno.  My dad's got to have a stash.  Yeah.  Never found it.  Found his condoms, though. 
[00:59:00]  Oof.  Oh, that is so wrong.  When you're snooping as a kid.  Oh.  That was the worst thing I ever found, though.  Yeah.  I imagine other people found worse.  That's good.  I used to snoop everywhere, though.  Like, friends' houses.  And you'd snoop in their parents' room.  And once I found...  It was a very conservative, older couple.  Dude, can I back up?  Very religious.  Can I back up?  Because this is a true story.  Yeah.  So I find my dad's condoms, and I decided to try one on to see how he measured up.  All right. 
[00:59:30]  Now we're getting the story.  God's honest truth.  I'm like, man, I got a long ways to go.  How old?  I was young.  How did you know how to use it?  I barely knew.  Barely.  But I'm like...  You knew what it was used for, though?  Barely, yeah.  Yeah?  I guess enough if you didn't.  It's a very early memory.  I don't know...  I don't remember exactly.  I knew it was for sex, and I...  Yeah.  And I'm like, wow, okay.  All right, I can see where I measure up.  Man, I was swimming in this thing.  Put it over your head.  What?  Anyway.  But that's...  Yeah, I go snoop at a friend's house and found a... 
[01:00:00]  It was an older couple.  They had a bunch of kids.  Very religious.  And there was The Joy of Sex.  That book with all the illustrations of positions and stuff.  That book rocked when you were a kid.  Yeah, that was...  It was almost better than pornography.  Than Smut.  It was good in a pinch.  Because they were very graphic.  If you're 12 or 13, that was great.  And they drew in the big 70s Earth Mama Mops.  Yeah.  It was sickening. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  Oh, the picture.  So I was snooping through my father's bedroom.  And I find the pictures of her.  All artsy and stuff.  And they were hot.  She was younger.  And they were there.  And I used them.  I used the picture.  I used my father's girlfriend's pictures to get off.  How wrong is that?  And then one time I'm snooping through my mother's room when I was a kid.  Is that wronger than banging one of your dad's friends? 
[01:01:00]  No.  She was like 19.  It wasn't one of his friends.  It was like a friend of the family kind of thing.  It was a friend of your dad.  She used to come down and ride horses.  It was a friend of your dad.  And she found the old horse named Anthony.  Yeah.  Anthony at 17.  No.  I was about 16, 15, you said?  I think I was 13.  Yeah, I think it was my 13th birthday.  You know, I haven't said it in about six months.  You had the coolest dad.  Yeah.  I got a bike for my 13th birthday. 
[01:01:30]  Hey, I'm not complaining.  It was pretty cool 10-speed at the time.  You got buzzed.  I got a Ruger six-shooter pistol.  And a chick.  And laid for my birthday.  You're 13th?  Yeah.  Yeah, it was 13th birthday.  Good old Buzz.  Buzz.  Her name was Buzz.  She looked every bit her name.  She was an Amazon woman.  Not fat, but big.  You've never told us this detail. 
[01:02:00]  You used to kind of make it sound like she was put together nicely.  No, stop it.  Stop it.  She was big.  Not fat, but just take a normal, your average woman's body, right?  She was big bones.  Now just make it a little bigger.  Oh, boy.  That's what it looked like.  Huge jugs.  Big 70s earth mama moth.  Did your dad bang her, too, you think?  I don't know.  He was single back then and stuff, right?  No, actually, he was hooked up at that point.  Yeah.  You know, so, I don't know. 
[01:02:30]  I know a few of the other guys around the stable did, you know.  He was a stable whore?  Yeah.  She wanted a tag team with me and my friend Richard, but Richard turned out to be a homosexual.  He was the one that touched you.  He tried to.  Up in the tree fort.  Right, I remember that.  We were sleeping.  We were sleeping.  He was my best friend.  My best friend, from the time I got to California, and then, because we used to ride horses and stuff.  So he goes, he's like, hey, you want to sleep at the stable tonight? 
[01:03:00]  Because you do that as kids, you know.  I was like, yeah, sure.  So we go to sleep up in the tree fort that we built.  And he goes, hey, you want a job?  I was like, what?  What the?  What?  So after he was done, I just said, I got no more hanging with this guy.  Yeah, so he goes, yeah, you want a job? 
[01:03:30]  I'm like, we had just gone fishing yesterday.  And the joke's on you, because I'm not gay.  Because I'm not even gay.  I was like, whoa.  And then, to tell you the truth, you know what?  I didn't even say anything.  I just did the uncomfortable made believe I was asleep thing.  Like the child in the room.  Like, because he just whispered it.  Do you want a job?  And I'm like.  I'm doing the exaggerated Three Stooges snore. 
[01:04:00]  As you clenched up nice and tight.  You want me to suck your sea?  I'll take your sea in my mouth. 
[01:04:30]  That was Richard.  Good old Richard.  Richard out there in San Juan Capistrano, California.  Let's go.  Wait until we get on the air in L.A. at some point.  Those stories might actually get a phone call. 
[01:05:00]  Howdy, faggot.  How you doing?  I actually saw him when I went back out to California to visit my father.  There's more there, though.  Hold on.  Before you get the update.  Now, did you sleep the night?  Yeah.  With one eye on him?  Oh, no.  No, not slept.  I stayed there.  Like, just like, I didn't hear it.  I didn't hear a goddamn thing.  You zipped up your sleeping bag nice and tight.  It was it.  And he was in it.  No, I just was like, I was like, you know something? 
[01:05:30]  Maybe he had one course too many.  Maybe, you know.  How old were you?  Probably 13.  Drinking guns, whores, gay guys.  It was insane.  Insane out there.  It was insanity.  I loved it.  So the next day, you just made believe.  Oh.  So the next day, you made believe that he never said it?  Yeah. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  And he never brought it up again?  He never brought it up again.  So how long did you stay friends?  I know that gay people out there can get pissed off at us, but it just kind of, especially  at that age, it makes it a little awkward to continue with your friendship.  Yeah, after that, it was a little awkward.  Still friends with him, though.  Yeah, I was still friends with the guy.  That's pretty white of you.  But, yeah, mighty white of me.  But, no, there were no more sleepovers, I'll tell you that much.  And he started hanging out with people that were a little more gay, you know, like people. 
[01:06:30]  I didn't know who they were, and all of a sudden he'd show up at the horse table with some guy.  And I, quite frankly, was a little jealous.  I, um, you know, he'd show up with some people.  And then as he got older, I think he became some kind of model and went, you know, off somewhere.  Yeah.  But then, like I said, I saw him when I went to visit my father back in, Christ, this was  maybe 88, somewhere around that time period.  And him and, uh, this kid, Richard, and my father's, uh, wife were off curtain shopping. 
[01:07:00]  Shopping for curtains.  I was like, huh, I guess I'll miss him.  Good thing, because if I had to see him after that, it's like, hey, how about I take you up  on that offer now?  I could use a little release.  Can you do more of your, uh, sleeping thing?  I want to put your bees in my mouth. 
[01:07:30]  How did the conversation, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Can you, can you have my face?  I'm getting, like, sleep apnea.  There's one other thing.  What were you guys doing during the day?  Like, you were riding horses and all that. 
[01:08:00]  So how did the conversation, how did the conversation, how did the conversation, I didn't know he wanted  one more shot in the face.  How did the conversation start, though?  Or did it just go right to that?  Actually, as, as, I guess, as any kids hanging out at 13, you talk about sex, yeah.  No, well, because actually, I had already had sex with that, that, that creature, that  Buzz creature.  Buzz, all right.  But when you're, when you're having the sleepovers with your friends and stuff, when you're younger,  you end up just talking until you, you talk yourself right into sleep. 
[01:08:30]  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So I'm assuming there was a whole conversation going, and then, yeah, then he pops that question  out of nowhere.  Because I'm telling him what, you know, what Buzz was doing to me and stuff like that.  You know, kind of getting into the sex conversation, thinking it's two guys talking about  sex.  And at one point, Buzz even said, why don't, you know, you and, and Richard come back and,  you know, tag me, double team me.  And Richard wasn't into it.  He said, no, no, no.  And you didn't know he was gay at this point.  No!  Not up until the, F my face! 
[01:09:00]  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  Then it was kind of like, you want your back rubbed?  Oh, revelation!  Now I understand.  Hey, Anthony, you want your back rubbed?  Yoo-hoo!  There's nothing more uncomfortable than that situation when I was 13 years old. 
[01:09:30]  Dude, I was, and, and, and I was in the tree fort and my face was against the wood wall  that was furthest away from him.  But I want to, I turned my, my, my waist so my ass was firmly against the bottom of the, 
[01:10:00]  and, uh, I was like, I took up a defensive posture.  Push until I choke.  Oh, wait, wrong voice.  You were pretending to be sleeping, but your eyes were as wide as buckwheats.  I was like, petrified.  Look at Dale from Jersey.  You had a chance to hit a bummer from a model and you declined? 
[01:10:30]  Oh, is that good?  Yeah.  That's good stuff.  That would happen.  All right, man, the phones have exploded.  I mean, exploded.  We're going to try to get to everybody.  Everything from snooping to the videotape stuff, yeah.  Yeah, we're on to a couple of good things here.  The snooping.  I'll tell you what I found in my mom's drawer when I was snooping one night, too.  Oh, look at that for a radio tease.  Uh, Jeff.  Yeah.  We're going to go to you next, all right?  All right, no problem.  Cool.  All right, cool.  Uh, Jeff, a friend showed me his tape.  It was actually pretty cool. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  His sex tape.  So we'll go to him next.  Wow, man, that's funny.  And then Keith the Cobb has some stuff.  We got some good things on the way, so.  All right.

And it started out with a Wednesday thing, a Wednesday theme.  But now, man, ladies, if you see wow in a car somewhere out there, that guy wants to see your fun bags.  You don't have to do it.  But it would be very nice.  And the guys know, don't harass the ladies. 
[01:22:30]  Don't follow the ladies.  Let it happen and move on with your life.  Okay?  Your job ends once you slap that wow on.  That's it.  Be cool.  A lot of people were asking me if I fell asleep in that tree fort when my friend at 13, Richard,  decided to ask me if I wanted a job from him.  And no, I didn't fall asleep.  That was the whole thing.  I had to spend the whole night awake staring at the opposite wall of the tree fort.  And I felt like the guy in Night of the Living Dead when I finally saw the sunrise. 
[01:23:00]  Like, oh, it's over.  Thank God.  Right.  Oh, thank God.  I made it through the night.  Jameet from Brooklyn.  Hey, Ant, don't worry.  It's not gay if you don't wake up.  We got a really hot girl outside the studio that is going to enter the wow contest here in New York City.  Really?  A New York entry?  Yes.  Nice.  I'm very confident in this entry.  She's going to get a lot of votes when the voting begins one of these days. 
[01:23:30]  Very good.  When we get her pictures done, we'll get them up as soon as possible on opianthony.com.  She's nice, right, Rick?  Hot.  Very hot.  Good deal.  Blonde.  Hot blonde.  Getting ready to enter the wow contest.  Okay, we said we'd go to Jeff.  We're on about three or four different subjects right now, but that's okay.  Jeff, you're next on the Opian Anthony show.  What do you got?  Happy Wow's Day, guys.  Thank you.  Wow's Day.  Yep.  I was just saying before, or I was listening before, you were mentioning that one guy was 
[01:24:00]  going to get drunk and show it to his buddies.  That's exactly what my best friend did.  All right, yeah, we're talking about the sex tapes.  So your buddy made one of these sex tapes and decided to show you guys?  Yeah, he decided to show me and my wife of all people.  Uh-oh.  We were sitting there at his apartment, and it was like a whole bunch of us getting drunk  off our ass.  He got wasted, to say the least.  And he pulls out this tape.  It's him going to the lower region to give his girlfriend something nice.  Yeah, we know.  Treats, yes.  And sure enough, you know, that was all he would show us. 
[01:24:30]  We didn't want to see his ass or anything like that, that's for sure.  I mean, it was just great the way he was showing it.  But how he was laughing the entire time, completely blasted off his face.  So you just showed him snacking.  I got to tell you, Jeff, you say face.  Because it says on the screen, friend showed me his porn tape, you know, doing his girl  there.  And it was actually pretty cool.  But you just made it sound like it was cool.  Because you didn't have to see your friend's junk. 
[01:25:00]  You got to see his girlfriend naked.  And you got to see him being all silly and stupid.  Just him munching.  Yeah, but he ended up breaking up with her.  So it is evidence in the end result.  But nevertheless, yeah, it was cool for all of us.  All right.  No good comes of it.  Thank you, Jeff.  Hey, guys, you have a good time.  I'm over here now, dot com.  All right.  Jared, what's up?  Guys, what's going on?  Hey.  Just quickly, Ant, this wasn't Richard Hatch from Survivor, was it?  No, it wasn't Richard Hatch from Survivor.  It was Richard Simmons. 
[01:25:30]  No, it wasn't Richard Simmons.  Oh, I thought you said when we were doing the commercials that it was.  No.  All right.  What's up, Jared?  I just want to say, while Ant's talking about these California stories,  he's got to tell the story of Dreamweaver with the song in the background.  Oh.  You know what?  Geez, that one.  You know what we'll do?  We're going to have to take some days off soon, I guess.  We'll replay Dreamweaver when we go on break.  Yeah.  Sounds good.  It's a great story, but I don't think Ant could ever tell it as well as he did the first time.  No, no.  It's another fond memory from California. 
[01:26:00]  With all the music and stuff.  We'll replay it, Jared.  Sounds good.  Also, just one more thing.  I just checked out the Sacramento latest entrance on the WOW contest.  Hot streak is over.  Oh, WOW is not the word.  Hot streak is over.  Hot streak is over.  All right.  I'm expecting a call from an angry girl around 6.18 tonight, New York Times.  No way, she's not going to call.  Let's go to Keith the Cop.  Hey, Keith, what's going on?  What's going on, fellas? 
[01:26:30]  I actually have two quick stories, and then I'll get to the one reason that you drawed  my memory, and I don't know why I'm going to tell the story on the air, but the first  story was about making sex tapes.  When I was in high school, I did that with a girlfriend.  You know, we put the camera on the ground behind us.  Oh, behind it?  What was it?  The bob shot?  Oh, yeah.  The back of the yam bag shot?  It was absolutely horrible.  It was like hairy, just, oh.  Can I stop you there?  Because Dan from PA writes, I don't even like seeing myself play sports or talk on camera, 
[01:27:00]  let alone my hairy white ass moving around.  He makes a good point.  We've all seen, like, what we've said, you know, during the wedding tapes and stuff.  Like, oh, God.  Oh, the drunken.  I want to wish her the best, even though she's a C.  And you never take it back.  But he makes a good point.  And we don't like seeing ourselves doing regular stuff on camera.  Why, you know, why would we want to see ourselves having sex?  Go ahead.  Yeah, so, you know, we watched it, and I saved it. 
[01:27:30]  And it was on a tape that was labeled Miami Vice.  Code word, Miami Vice.  And, you know, my cousin happened to live with us at the time, and I was walking through  the living room, and, you know, he had popped in that tape, and lo and behold, there I was  on the tape, you know.  It was just my hairy ass.  Dude, what is this?  I'm like, oh, my God.  It was disgusting.  After that, the tape had to go.  How do you leave it around? 
[01:28:00]  You know, I was going to want to watch Miami Vice.  The guy probably going to go on and be like, oh, I'll watch the Adventures of Crockett and  Tubbs here.  Let me see what, oh, my God.  Yeah, that was horrible.  The second story was, years ago, my old man had a friend who went to a video store, and  it closed down the video store, so he gave us all these old pornos, Deep Throat and all  stuff like that.  Yeah.  So my old man was cool.  He let me watch them, so one day I was watching one of the tapes, and it was like a documentary  sort of thing, and one of my parents' friends was in the group orgy scene. 
[01:28:30]  Oh, my God.  In the porno.  So, like, I could not say, you know, I was like, you got to look at this.  Of course.  And, you know, like, it was actually with a friend of my aunt, and we had to bring it  to my aunt, and she was like, we showed her, and she was like totally devastated.  She was like, what do I say?  Do I say anything to her?  Wow.  And they said something to her, but she was like totally cool with it.  She's like, yeah, it was the 60s, you know, it was like big, hairy, sort of disgusting. 
[01:29:00]  All right, Kate, these are the warm-up stories.  Now, what do you want to say?  So you were talking about how you were snooping, and you found your dad's condoms and everything?  Yeah, and then I tried it on to see where I...  Well, one time, and I've never thought of this since the day it happened.  I was probably in, like, junior high school when I was home.  I was sick, and...  Nothing better than a fever jerk.  A hot fever jerk.  Oh, man, I can't believe what I'm going to say. 
[01:29:30]  But, so anyway, the doctor's office had called for whatever reason.  I guess, you know, my mom or something, you know, had called the doctor's office to check  up on me, and I had taken my temperature, and they asked me, they're like, well, what  was your temperature?  And I'm like, well, I don't know, you know.  I said, well, that's the top of the thermometer.  Like, well, you know, the thermometer, you know, it can't be that high.  You know, what's the highest thing?  And I told them whatever the degrees was, and it turns out, like, I guess there's a certain  type of thermometer that people use for birth control, like, monitoring their birth control. 
[01:30:00]  Oh, like an ovulation thermometer?  Right.  Well, it turns out that I had used this thermometer, and the girl was, the nurse was, like, talking  to the other nurse, like, what sort of thermometer?  And the other nurse was like, oh, that, you know, and she's like, oh.  And she's like, you shouldn't really use that thermometer, you know, it's in your mouth.  And I was like, oh, my God.  Dude, wait, now, let me just ask, so you can confirm it, who was using the thermometer 
[01:30:30]  to check for their proper ovulation?  It was my mom.  Have fun at work today, Keith, because I'm sure the guys will leave you alone.  You know, it's one of those things.  And, you know, I hope she's not listening, because she listens to the show you guys have  talked to before.  Yeah, she's cool.  Yeah, she is, but it was like, well, she just drawed my memory, and I was like, oh,  my God.  And then I had the phone in my hand, and I'm like, do I call and tell this story on the  air? 
[01:31:00]  Wow.  How come it tastes like when Dad kisses me goodnight sometimes?  So I'm sure my phone's going to start ringing off the hook, but that was my horror show snooping  story.  But it wasn't really a snooping story, but.  Yeah.  That's a pretty good one.  That's classic.  All right, fellas.  I'll see you later.  All right, bye.  Have fun at work.  I actually thought he was going for the back door angle on the thermometer.  Who knew where he was going with that one?  Oh, like that's better?  No.  It isn't.  He put it in his mouth. 
[01:31:30]  Oh, classic.  Jim from Philly.  I'm glad I videotaped me and my ex.  She's going to school to be a doctor now, and she's willing to give me the $8,000 she owes  me to get the tape back.  Oh.  She swore I'd never see that money.  God bless camcorders.  Little black man.  So there's a positive one.  Marty from Philly.  Tape girlfriend and I having sex.  She insisted on erasing the tape that night, which I did.  Rewound tape, but VCR rewound, leaving two seconds at the beginning.  Months later, I recorded a TV show, went to her house to watch it with her and her mom. 
[01:32:00]  Popped the tape in, pressed play, saw a two-second flash of us nude.  Mom didn't say a word.  The whole time, we were on needles, waiting for her to ask what the hell that was.  Later, the tape was destroyed.  And Jameek from Brooklyn.  My girlfriend's mom is a very religious woman.  She's the really quiet type.  Well, one day, I was snooping in my girlfriend's mom's house.  I was shocked to find a two-pronged vibrator. 
[01:32:30]  Two-pronged?  For double action?  Yeah.  A bee plug.  Oh, well.  I'm going to come out of that.  Ah!  I'll back up, because they probably dumped that.  I was shocked to find a two-pronged vibrator, a bee plug, and a lube.  Oh, lube for that area.  Yeah, yeah.  In her mom's nightstand.  I can never look at her mom the same way again.  What did you find snooping?  I found, yeah, I was snooping around. 
[01:33:00]  Actually, I was looking for my Christmas present, or my birthday present.  So I'm snooping around my mom's room, and I knew what she was getting me.  She was getting me sub-search.  It was like a predecessor to a computer game.  It had, like, five LED numbers on it, and a chart, things.  And I was so psyched.  Well, yes, Lube?  I bet I know what you found.  What?  Baseball cards?  No!  Suck.  You suck.  Shut up. 
[01:33:30]  No.  There were no rookie cards.  Rookie cards!  All right, sorry.  Go ahead.  No.  Sound's going to kill you.  I was searching around for my birthday present, because I wanted to actually open it up and  play it, and then put it back.  An autographed baseball bat?  No!  You better shut up.  They listen to this program occasionally.  And they know I love them.  Of course.  All right.  You going to the party?  Of course I am. 
[01:34:00]  Very good.  No, it wasn't a Mick.  Rick.  You deal with Sal.  No way.  You don't want to deal with Sal, ever.  Go ahead.  So you're snooping for your birthday present.  Snooping around, and I went to the, you know, if you want to or don't want to know anything  about your parents, either go into or do not go into their night tables.  Those night tables, they give you more insight into your parents than anything else. 
[01:34:30]  It's where you find the pictures or the cards or the letter or something that is like, whoa.  You know, because it's personal stuff and you shouldn't be snooping around in there.  So I open it up, there was this device, it's all I could say, it said it was a muscle massager.  And I just assumed since my mom had been a, that's what they used to call a man, been  a, she was a cocktail waitress at a disco, you know, out on Long Island.  So she's on her feet all the time. 
[01:35:00]  I assumed she just needed the muscle relaxing properties of the device.  What shape was the muscle relaxer in?  No, it wasn't like one of those muscle relaxers where it's like obviously a dill.  No, it was, it had a handle.  And then above the handle where you held it, it was kind of square, rectangular thing.  And then out the side was this knob thing that you could put rubber attachments onto,  like a suction cup or a ball or a thing with a bunch of spiky things sticking out of it. 
[01:35:30]  And then I'm talking many years ago.  And she, you know, it was probably going to work out the muscles.  Did you know what it was?  No.  No, I didn't at the time.  Yeah.  Good thing I didn't, because sickly, I probably would have tried it on myself.  This was before anything.  I was very young, you know, I was a youngster, so I didn't know. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  But I knew, I guess I knew enough not to ask, which is good.  But also, I was snooping around, so I couldn't ask.  You know what we should do today?  We have a lot of young listeners.  We should have all the young listeners go into their parents' nightstands right now.  Oh, kids.  Tell us what you find.  We know you listen.  The people tell us all the time we're bad influences on the children.  You know, kids, we give you so much entertainment on a daily basis that you go to school, you can have fun with it.  But we just need a favor from you now. 
[01:36:30]  Uncle Opie and Uncle Anthony need you.  And we did it when we were your age.  Yeah.  Now, your parents, your parents can't be home.  This is a great time, too, because a lot of parents aren't home from work yet.  We need those neglected latchkey children to call us up.  Call us up, because we want you to help us out.  What does Mommy and Daddy have in their nightstands?  What do they have in their nightstands?  Oh, God, I love this one.

[01:49:00]  This is Opie and Anthony on Philadelphia's number one rock station, 94 WYSP.  Opie and Anthony on the screen. 
[01:49:30]  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  If I was in the Israeli army, I would just blast this out of my tanks as I blow up those animals.  A message to the rest of the country. 
[01:50:00]  Wow contest over!  My God.  Good luck beating the girl we got outside the studio.  Good effing luck, Chicago, Dallas, Philly, Washington, Boston, Sacramento, and the rest of you.  New York stepped up today, man.  We got representation from New York for once.  A very normal-looking girl with just beautiful, beautiful boobs.  Yeah.  A hot one.  The whole package. 
[01:50:30]  She's Norwegian, Opie.  Really?  She's Norwegian.  And she's got a little Catholic schoolgirl skirt on.  She's got some high heels.  She's got her underwear pulled up a little bit.  Right.  Underwear.  That's hot.  She's got her bloomers pulled up a little.  She's got her underpants.  She's got her panties pulled up a little bit.  Panties.  Panties.  And then she's got, what, like a little, a tiny little top on.  You guys are done!  And have we said lately that Sacramento's hot streak is over? 
[01:51:00]  I think so, yeah.  Rick has taken at least 100 pictures of this girl so far.  We're not going to F this one up.  No.  Sometimes we get the hot girls here in New York, and then we look at the pictures after they leave, and we're like, what happened?  Uh-huh.  Must be the lighting or something.  Yeah, so we're making sure.  Is that kind of a tip-off to the girls if Rick only takes, like, one or two pictures of you?  Gosh, like, he's out there still.  This is like a real photo shoot going on out there now. 
[01:51:30]  It's been about 20 minutes.  He's snapping away.  Don't give out all our secrets.  Ah, right.  I know.  We've got a lot of secrets on this show.  There's some things I should just keep quiet about.  That's right.  Earl, what's up?  Hey, guys.  We're at Kawasaki Sports Center, 566 Route 23 North in Pompton Plains, New Jersey.  The turnout's been unbelievable.  You're right, Opie.  The show was going much too well and smoothly, and we were up and talking.  You're right.  We needed this. 
[01:52:00]  F you both.  But we're here.  We'll be here for a couple more minutes handing out wow stickers, and we had two girls wow the crowd.  Oh.  Earl, your old pal is going to teach a little bit about radio today, okay?  Get out your notebook.  Take notes now.  Why would you call from a sticker stop if you're leaving in 10 minutes?  The whole purpose of calling a show when you're out on the road is to promote it so you get people down there.  You already got the people down there, so why would you call when you're going to be leaving? 
[01:52:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Well, we're obligated to make two calls.  This is my second call.  This is at least your fourth.  No, it's my second.  And did you get any girls wowing for those baby tees?  Yes, we've had two girls so far.  Oh.  All right.  Earl, you want to put in a little overtime today and maybe stay 15 minutes extra?  If that's what you want, hey, it's your show.  Oh.  That didn't sound like you really wanted to do it. 
[01:53:00]  I'm just thinking, Earl, if you're having a good time and people are showing up there, maybe you should...  Yeah, whatever.  I mean...  Maybe you should stay a little later.  Yeah, New Jersey has definitely shown the love today.  Hey, here's a girl that, um...  Hey, where'd you get that baby tees?  I got it from a Negro.  Oh, you sound like a guy.  Is this 1999?  I know.  I'm digging the Earl at the sticker stop, though.  Yes, Earl.  Thank you.  Well, thank you, guys.  Okay.  Take care.  Black Earl.  Thank you, Earl.  Earl? 
[01:53:30]  Earl?  That's him leaving.  Earl?  No, he's right there.  I have to ask him one more thing.  Hello?  Earl?  Earl, my friend.  Earl?  Hello?  You're not going to get me.  No.  I just want to ask you something.  You're not going to get me.  Too smart for us.  All right.  Rob Zilla from Jersey.  My cousin was snooping once and found Benoit balls in a box under his mom's bed.  He thought it was a necklace and wore them around the house. 
[01:54:00]  Better than finding it in the box on his mom's bed.  That would be embarrassing.  Let me go to Amber, 11 years old.  Amber.  Hi.  What's up, Amber?  I just looked and I found some Rolling Stone magazines and birth control pills.  And you want to explain what's going on right now?  We want the kids that listen to this show, the young children, to go into their parents. 
[01:54:30]  Your parents aren't home, right?  Well, they're home, but my mom doesn't know, so she's downstairs taking care of the little  kids.  How many kids do you have in your family?  Three.  Well, another one, but he lives in Buffalo, so we don't see him every day.  Yeah.  And you went through your mom's night table?  Mm-hmm.  Do you still have a dad that lives there?  Well, I have a stepdad.  My real dad gets me on the weekends.  Ah.  Did you look through your stepdad's night table?  Yeah.  Well, a little because he's really picky, so if anything was moved, he'd know and I 
[01:55:00]  don't want to get in trouble.  Right.  That's smart.  Hey, I'm going to leave Amber alone.  Thanks, Amber.  You're welcome.  All right.  Bye.  I just got to say one thing.  Thank God Jim Norton took today on.  No X.  Jay, what's going on?  What's up, O&A?  Hey, well, I'm 13, I'm home, and, well, I'm ready to snoop in my parents' room live. 
[01:55:30]  You got a cordless phone?  No.  You want me to change phones?  You got one in your parents' room?  Yeah.  All right.  We'll get in there.  All right.  Hold on.  I remember being 13.  It's like, uh, eh.  All right.  Is that better?  The voice of a 13-year-old.  Yeah.  All right, Jay.  Now, does your mother and father, they live together?  Yeah.  And they both have night tables?  Yeah.  On either side of the bed. 
[01:56:00]  Okay.  And your parents aren't home, right?  Right.  All right.  Open up your mom's.  All right.  Hold on.  Could be nothing, you know.  We just want to, we kind of want to get a feel.  Okay.  All right.  Well, we got a vibrating device.  Get out of here.  Stop.  I'm serious.  What does it look like?  It's metal.  And it's like, you know, long, like, you know, guys.  Yeah, right, right, right.  And it has a switch, like, you know, where?  Jay, Jay. 
[01:56:30]  It has different speeds?  What?  Yeah.  Turn it on.  Hold on.  All right.  I got to fill this thing with batteries.  What?  There's no batteries in it?  No.  Hold on.  See if I can find some out on my CD player.  What do they take?  C's?  Um, no.  Well, while you get the batteries, tell us what else you've got in the drawer.  Um, well, that's pretty much it.  That's it? 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Well, now go to the dad's side.  All right.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  We got a Playboy magazine.  What issue?  Natural beauty.  All right.  And condoms.  Yeah.  Lifestyles, ribs.  And, um, another one.  Yeah.  Lifestyles, ultra-sensitive with spermicide. 
[01:57:30]  That's great.  Your parents are doing some of that effing.  Uh-huh.  All right.  Well, I'm going to go to my room and try to get some batteries for this baby.  All right.  For this baby.  All right.  Well, we'll keep you on hold there, all right?  All right.  All right.  We'll go back to you in a second.  Okay.  This is working out pretty well, Apple.  That's pretty good.  Let me go to Joe.  Hey, Joe.  What's up?  Natural beauties.  Uh, what's up, Boney?  Hey, Joe.  Your parents are...  I'm 12. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  My parents aren't home.  Okay.  Uh, and, uh, I...  My dad's got a magazine rack next to his bed, and my mom's got a nightstand next to her bed.  All right.  Is there any private areas that they could put, um, uh, like a drawer or something?  Yeah, there's a drawer.  All right.  Go into your mom's drawer.  All right.  All right.  Ooh, good stuff.  We got a penthouse.  And your mom's drawer?  No, it's my dad's.  Oh, your dad's?  What issue?  Uh, this is...  Oh, there's some old ones in here, and then there's some newer ones. 
[01:58:30]  Uh, this 1988, uh, Paula Parkinson, who's this?  1988?  He likes them old school.  He must have liked that issue a real lot.  Yeah, you saved those.  You saved the ones that you have your girlfriend in.  Uh, we got a Playboy.  Okay.  Yeah.  Uh, and we got a couple of the old, uh, uh, swimsuit issues.  Fort illustrated.  Fort illustrated.  Okay.  Uh, some more penthouse.  Jesus.  And, uh, I'm going into my mom's now.

And I went downstairs, um, to find something for someone, and I found, like, a 70s Playboy,  like, uh, Christmas edition.  Isn't that great, man? 
[02:02:00]  Remember when you were 13, Opie?  And you found things like that?  Actually, I was 10 then, so...  Well, whatever age.  Even earlier.  Did you take it?

Hey, Anthony, living in, uh, L.A., how many times did you go down to Mexico?  I used to go, yeah, down to Tijuana and, uh.  All the time, right?  Yeah.  Okay, well, we had a family friend, he's about 10 years older than all of us, and he took 
[02:03:00]  me down as a graduation, uh, gift for high school.  Yeah.  And we drove all the way down to Puerto Vallarta, and if you know Mexico, it's a couple days'  drive.  Mm-hmm.  Well, I got down there, got really hammered with him one night, and I kind of, well,  no, at first, you know, the first faggot came out of my mouth, I started cursing, and  then all of a sudden it dawned on me, should I have finished? 
[02:03:30]  Oh, and you're willing to admit this today?  Well, you know, what do you expect?  I'm married, I got kids, it was just, it was his fault, he falls asleep, wakes up, he's  got his junk in another guy's, so is it gay if you didn't know what was happening?  Yeah, I can laugh at it today, but let me tell you, I felt two years of frustration.  All right, thank you, Matthew.  Take care, guys, you make my ride beautiful.  All right, thanks, man.

[02:13:00]  Opie and Anthony rock on YSB.  Rick is outside the studio taking pictures of this really hot Nordic blonde  that stopped by for the WOW contest still.  He's been taking her pictures for the last hour.  Yeah.  I just walked outside during commercials.  The girl looks like a completely different girl now.  Yeah.  She showed up in like a plaid skirt and a nice top,  and she had long, flowing blonde, dry hair. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  We just walked out, she's down to nothing but panties,  and now her hair is completely wet.  All wet.  She's soaked completely down everywhere.  I saw Rick throw a cup of water right on her breasts.  I just saw him like splash her with water.  He goes, now lean back, you're on the beach,  you're just like rubbing in lotion.  Now look, don't look at me.  Look at that shot.  Rick has entered the studio.  Are you happy with the shot she took?  Some of my finest work.  This could be the deciding shot. 
[02:14:00]  I give you a lot of credit, Rick,  because how you talk to these ladies, I couldn't look them in the eye  and say the things you say.  Look at that one.  Holy ass.  Get this up immediately.  That's a spank shot.  Very nice.  Get this up immediately.  You should pick what shots Scott should put up on opianthony.com.  The latest contestant in the WOW Contest.  Wait till you see this girl.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I've got to find this one for you.  Good luck to the other cities.  Yeah, good luck coming back from this one.  Beat this. 
[02:14:30]  Very proud.  We're here.  Hurry up, Rick, because you've got to die.  Kids have more snooping in their parents' drawers and stuff.  Wow.  Let me see that one.  It's amazing what a little bit of water can do.  You know, I'm going to sound really stupid,  but for the first time, I don't know the answer to this.  Are those real or fake?  Those look very real.  They do, right?  Because she's got the ass to match.  In a good way.  In a good way.  She's a dancer.  She's a dancer.  Not that type of dancer, though.  Like the real dancing.  She does some of that real dancing.  Classical stuff. 
[02:15:00]  Ballet stuff.  Steps.  Good shape.  There you go.  Rick, once again.  She's a thoroughbred.  All right, get those up on opnetthing.com.  She's a thoroughbred.  Contest over.  Thank you.  And Sacramento's hot streak is over.  Jason, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  Hey, man.  Yeah, I'm ready to go into my pantry and look,  see what's in the drawer.  Yeah, you know, a lot of people getting out of work right now,  and you want to re-explain this?  Well, I don't know how we got here.  We were kind of talking about snooping in your parents' room, 
[02:15:30]  what you found when you were a kid and stuff,  and now we have some kids on the phone,  and we've asked them to help us out a little.  So we want them to go through their parents' night tables in their bedroom  and see if they find some of the fun stuff we found as kids,  little mechanical devices, pictures, letters, whatever.  We're just looking for things of interest that the kids might find  while their parents aren't home.  Okay.  And, Jason, you're in your parents' room?  Yes.  All right.  Does your mom and dad live together?  Yes, they do. 
[02:16:00]  And they both have night tables?  Hello?  Yeah, I'm still here.  Who picked up the other phone, Jason?  My brother did.  Okay.  Keep your brother off the phone.  All right, let's start snooping.  Okay.  I'm going to go into my dad's door first.  Okay.  All right.  Underneath here I see...  I found a box of condoms.  What kind?  Trojan. 
[02:16:30]  What kind?  What kind?  Any special kind?  No, not really.  They're out of the box.  Oh, they're out of the box?  Mm-hmm.  What else do I see?  Here's a Playboy issue.  Get a pin, Jason.  Get a pin?  No.  Teasing, of course.  Oh, my God.  Jason, do you want another brother?  You want another brother, Jason, or maybe a little sister?  Get yourself a pin.  That's all we need is paying child support for his new little brother as we effed up.  All right. 
[02:17:00]  What else, Jason?  I found a 1998 Playboy issue.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  And who was on the cover?  It's the Babes of Baywatch issue.  A lot of condoms and Playboys in dad's drawers.  Anything else?  No, I think that's it.  That's it?  All right.  Go to mom's side.  All right.  Let me shut this door.  Are they keeping something?  What was that, a bottle of whiskey?  No.  What is that? 
[02:17:30]  What's all that?  Just bottles.  Okay.  Go ahead.  I see a couple thongs.  Thongs?  Your mom's thongs?  Yeah, but I'm not going to touch them.  Yeah, I wouldn't do that.  Jason, what did your mom have for lunch?  I don't know.  Yeah, are there any strange markings on there, Jason?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  All right, go ahead, Jason.  I was hoping it went right over his head.  All right.  Anything else, Jason? 
[02:18:00]  Mom's in too much stuff in there.  I don't see anything else.  No?  All right.  Well, you did a good job for us, please.  Thongs, condoms, and more Playboys.  Well, the Babes of Baywatch issue, Anthony.  Yes, the Babes of Baywatch.  I remember that.  That was a fine issue of Playboy.  All right, Jason.  Thanks.  See you later.  Good job, by Jason.  There you go.  Seems to be a running theme, though.  I want the real surprising thing, like, uh-oh.  Viagra.  This picture's a dad doing a doggie with, you know, something.  Aaron.  Yeah.  What's up?  Nothing much on it. 
[02:18:30]  How's it going?  Pretty good.  Okay.  Well, Austin, Gary told me to look through while I was waiting.  All right.  And I found probably the most disgusting thing I've ever seen in my life.  All right.  Be careful how you say it, my friend.  All right.  I found two dills.  I swear to God, one of them is, uh, it's red, and at the end, it's a little curved.  Yeah.  And the other one...  For her pleasure.  Yeah.  And the other one is, uh, is, uh, skin-colored. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  And they both, uh, apparently vibrate.  Oh, they do?  Yeah.  Why don't you click those on for us?  All right.  Oh, gross-ass, touch it.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  No, it has a, uh, paper towel wrapped around it, so it's...  All right, all right.  Don't explain why.  These kids are hilarious today.  Ugh.  Okay, hold on.  Let me see if I can, uh...  Okay.  Find a way to turn this on.  All right, all right.  Come on.  Mm-hmm. 
[02:19:30]  Did you get that?  What the hell was that?  I don't know.  It's apparently low, but, ugh.  I'm going to put it back.  I don't feel like touching it anymore.  All right.  And apparently everything seems to be in one drawer, because that's all I'm finding.  Yeah.  I found a pair of, uh, or a box of, uh, Durex condoms.  All right.  Durex.  High sensation, uh, enhanced rips for extra stimulation.  Lubricated.  Yeah.  And I found two Girls Gone Wild DVDs.  Girls Gone Wild DVDs. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah.  All right, Pop.  All right.  Yeah.  So, uh, it's everything, everything's in one drawer, and I have to be careful, because,  uh, I don't know if the cabinet was sort of open, and I have to be careful on how I close it.  Right.  All right, Aaron.  Put it back exactly like you found it.  Yes, I'm trying.  Good job today, Aaron.  Okay, thank you.  Okay.  Bye-bye.  Another parent panicking right now.  John, what's going on?  Real fast.  Yes, Jim.  Guys, I'm sweating my A off, because my son listens to you guys every day.  If he gets a hold of his mother's handcuffs and put them on, she's away for two weeks.  I'm going to be screwed. 
[02:20:30]  Oh, my God.  I got animal porn in there, too.  If he ever finds out, I'll really be dead.  All right, John.  Bye.  Try to explain that to the cops.  Stop admitting felonies on the air.  Thank you.  Very cool.  He brings up a great point, because I, when I was a kid, my father was, uh, he was a private  investigator, um, I found his handcuffs and put them around my ankles.  I was, I was about five, five years old, and I put them around my ankles, and he didn't  have the key. 
[02:21:00]  He couldn't find the key.  So how'd you get the handcuffs off?  His buddy, uh, Jimmy McNally, had to come over with a saw and cut them off of my legs.  I was always kidding.  In the meantime, Richard kept you company while they went and got the saw.  I can't run.  I got you right where I wants you, Anthony.  Hey, you gotta tell that other story.  Pop it off, boss.  Well, hold on.  Eric has something really good, and then you gotta tell that story about, uh, the thing.  Oh, yeah.  I was always getting into something.  The knife fighter guy and stuff.  Hey, Eric, what's up? 
[02:21:30]  Eric.  Uh, hello?  What's up, Eric?  You're live on the air.  What's going on?  How you doing, man?  Oh, uh, you know, I was just, like, uh, looking through, and, um, I found Christmas ornaments.  Yeah.  And, like, a French maid outfit.  Where was that?  I was in the closet.  In your mom's, uh, closet in the bedroom?  Yeah.  A French maid outfit?  What do you think your mom does with a French maid outfit there, Eric?  Uh, I don't know, maybe she's a maid on the side. 
[02:22:00]  Maybe.  Yeah, you just keep that thought in your head until you can see a therapist.  It'll be better that way.  Yeah.  All right, thank you, Eric.  Thank you.  A little French maid outfit.  Why not?  That's line of the day.  Maybe she's a maid on the side.  He don't know.  This is the son.  What does he know?  Mom's gotta work.  We've been doing radio for eight years.  Why haven't we done this video?  I don't know.  This is the best.  All right, tell the story about the setup thing. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah, um, I was, uh, in California, of course.  That's where everything happened.  I should have got to write a goddamn book about when I was out there.  And, um, it seems all the women out there were really horny at the time, but not for  who they were with.  It was the 70s.  Yeah, it was really insane out there.  You used to bang in the 70s.  It was a free love, as they called it.  Free love.  But there was one woman.  Like, they would, all the adults would get hammered, stinking drunk all the time.  And then the women would come on to all of us kids that were around the place. 
[02:23:00]  Whether we were, you know, 13 through 16, you know, they would all come on to them.  And some, some of them actually did stuff, you know.  But there was one, she was, uh, she was cute.  She was like an Indian squaw type broad, you know.  Nice.  She had the braids and, uh, the dark hair.  Uh, a little Indian woman.  You know, woo-woo-woo Indian, not the dot-head variety.  And she had a pelt in her lap.  Big 70s pelt. 
[02:23:30]  Looked like a buffalo hump.  And she had a, her boyfriend, her husband, was, uh, this Indian who, I swear to God, he,  he looked like the Indian guy that was the bartender in From Dusk Till Dawn.  And, uh, that guy, just scary, always walked around with a huge, uh, knife on his belt.  And he was passed out.  And, uh, his, his girl goes, hey, uh, Anthony, come here.  Come here.  I gotta show you something. 
[02:24:00]  Come here.  And I'm like, okay.  I'm a dopey kid.  Okay.  So I run to the back area where all the hay bales are.  And, uh, of course, when you take hay bales off a big pile, it leaves like nooks and crannies.  So she, she, uh, climbs in and just starts taking her shirt off.  And I'm going, what, what, what, what do you, what do you, what do you, what, what do you, what?  She goes, come on.  No one, no one, no one will know.  I was like, no.  And even as a kid, you're just all, your hormones are going and stuff.  All I pictured was that big Indian slicing my throat when he found out that this happened. 
[02:24:30]  And, uh, left that alone.  Um, but scarier than that was then they started setting me up on these things where, uh, this  guy, Jimmy Jackson, ran the, uh, rent string of horses that I used to, uh, work for.  Is he the guy that sold dead horses?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, a real character.  Story for another day.  Real character out there.  So he was going to the Chino auction to buy some more horses.  And, uh, I was left there to take care of the rent string.  If the Marines came from Camp Pendleton to ride, you know, I'm the guy they paid and they, 
[02:25:00]  uh, went and took the horses out.  And so his wife, Patty, was still there at the trailer.  So, uh, Patty, I'm going to the kitchen.  I hear from her room, hey, Anthony, come in here.  I go, okay.  I walk in the room.  She's laying on the bed, uh, nude.  And she goes, come on in.  Completely nude.  Completely naked.  She goes, come on in.  I go, I would, you know, Jimmy, I, again, I'm just flabbergasted. 
[02:25:30]  And she's coaxing me and really trying to get me to go.  And as a kid, again, your hormones are racing.  I'm like, you know, I might be able to get away with this.  Uh, but I, I, I decided not to.  I said no.  And good thing, because, um, right when they realized I wasn't going to do anything, they,  they broke the joke.  And Jimmy Jackson, uh, had just driven his truck down, came back up.  He was in the closet with a shotgun, kicks the door open.  That's a sick joke.  And he's, he yells, you son of a bitch, what are you doing with my wife? 
[02:26:00]  But it kind of ruined the joke, because I wasn't doing that.  But I was thinking, if, if I would have actually taken her up on it.  Or at least just laid in bed with her or something.  Yeah, laid down there in the bed, and Jimmy came busting in with a shotgun.  Your little heart would have bursted.  Oh, I know.  You would have had a heart attack.  I probably would have.  But that's the type of wacky hijinks they were into out there.  And they're Jack Daniels-fueled intoxication.  Hey, uh, you gotta go to foundrymusic.com.  Why, what's up now?  Uh, Jim Norton's face is on one of the, the wow contestants. 
[02:26:30]  Turn that around and show in.  I know it's a visual, but oh my.  You sure that's Norton's face?  Boy, what a great job.  Ah.  Gee.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Let me see what I'm talking about.  That is good.  Let's go to Larry here.  Larry's 13 years old.  Larry, what's up?  Hi.  Hey, Larry. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah, I went through my mom's, um, drawer thing.  Good boy.  Yeah, and I found a whip.  A whip?  Yes.  How, how big is it?  Uh, it's like, you know, it has like some prongs on it.  What, is it, is it, uh, how, how many feet long is it?  I don't have a tape measure.  Well, approximately.  Is it a big, long bullwhip or a short one?  I'll say it's short.  All right.  Could you whip something with it?  I think it's called a crop.  Uh, let me see. 
[02:27:30]  Get it down.  Okay.  One second.  All right.  I'm going to whip it.  Whip it good.  Okay.  Let me, tell me if you hear it, okay?  All right.  Okay.  Anything?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What are they, like, barbs at the end or something?  Yeah.  What do you think mom uses that for, Larry?  Hurdling cows. 
[02:28:00]  Hurdling cows.  Maybe, maybe she's a wrangler on the side.  Yeah.  Larry, have you been bad?  Does she, uh, discipline you?  No.  She doesn't hit you, right?  No.  No.  All right.  What do she uses it for?  I wonder what that's for, then?  I don't know.  I don't know.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, Larry.  Anthony.  Thank you, Larry.  23 skidoo.  23 skidoo.  Let's go to Will.  Hubba hubba.  Will's 12 years old, Ann.  Hey, Will.  What's up?  Will?  Will.  Will, that's the radio. 
[02:28:30]  Oh, hello.  Yeah.  Turn down your radio.  Okay.  I recently just went in, and I found a box.  A box of tampons and an antidepressant bottle.  Is that in your mom's drawer?  Yes.  This is getting a little too personal, isn't it?  So you think your mom...  What was the name on the...  What's the name on the antidepressant bottle?  All it said was antidepressants, and my mom put a label over it. 
[02:29:00]  Oh.  Well, has your mom been in a better mood?  Yes.  Oh, there you go.  Doesn't yell as much?  Uh, yeah.  That's good.  She seems to be smiling a lot.  I would say tampons and antidepressants are a great combination.  Yes.  Yes.  And, uh, ant.  Yes?  Oh.  Did he set up the little bugger?  I gave it to him.  Hey, Uncle John, what's going on?  Guys, this is wrong. 
[02:29:30]  You've got kids with pre-pubescent voices now finding whips and drawers.  The kid's voice hasn't even changed yet.  We don't know what they're used for.  They're just, um, you know, they're going through their parents' drawers like we all did as kids.  Come on.  Oh, yeah.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, kids from Cell Block D or something, maybe.  Well, they all, you know, I remember doing this as a kid.  The snooping.  Oh, you're interrupting morals in 25 cities now.  You've got to snoop.  Oh, yeah.  All right, Uncle John.  Later.  Thank you.  Now, kids, put a dollar in the envelope and send it to Opie and Anthony. 
[02:30:00]  All right, Snoopy.  Snoopy.  Snoopy.  I stink.  Where's Norton?  Ugh.  All right.  More kids going through, uh, their parents' stuff.  Yeah.  This is really, uh, really kind of interesting.  This guy wants to do it live.  Ryan.  Hey, what's up?  13 years old?  Yep.  God, you notice some of the 13-year-olds, the voice is changing.  I like this.  Hi, I'm 13.  And other ones are like, Ryan.  Yep, yep, 13.  What's going on?  What's going on, Ryan? 
[02:30:30]  Well, do you want to know what I'm finding?  What?  Well, let's see.  Founding pictures.  Pictures?  Yeah.  What are they up?  My parents.  My mom.  Dressed up.  Sorry, I'm sorry.  Hold on.  I'm sorry.  Yo, that was my fault.  Hold on.  Watch your language, you potty mouth.  Ryan, you gotta be lying.  No.  What kind of outfit does she have on?  Oh, we got you, didn't we? 
[02:31:00]  Yeah.  No, it's a leather thing, kind of corset type, what are those things you see with, um, and  garter, what are those?  Ryan's panicking on us.  Yeah, Ryan.  Ryan, you didn't find the picture.  I think you're trying to elaborate a little bit, aren't you, Ryan?  I...  Did we catch you, Ryan?  No, I swear to you.  You gotta be honest now.  It's okay, but we kind of got you, didn't we? 
[02:31:30]  No.  And what are those things you hit horses with, Anthony?  The riding crop.  Yes.  There's one of those.  Well, whip it.  Oh, does she have one, or it's in the picture?  It's in the picture.  Oh.  And what is dad wearing?  Oh, no, my dad's not in it.  Oh.  Hmm.  All right, nothing else?  Um, I've seen some videos my dad has.  All right, Ryan, thank you.  Well, thank you, Ryan.  Ryan.  I think Ryan was trying too hard.  Ryan's gonna wreck the bit for everybody. 
[02:32:00]  It's one thing good about, uh, when the kids call up, it's very easy to tell if they're  fibbing.  Right.  Right.  Very easy.  Okay.  We're gonna step aside here, Anthony.  We're gonna get into some other things today as well.  We're gonna try.  Well, there's a bunch of, uh, kids still snooping around.  We'll go back to the followers.  Yeah, we'll go back to them.

We went, not really knowing what we wanted, but were helped by Colleen and Melissa.  They were so helpful.  Let us try everything.  We're so patient, answered all of our questions.  I'm just so pleased with the service.  I told them, I wish I had had that kind of service when I went to go buy my wedding dress.  They were so unhelpful. 
[02:36:30]  When I went to go buy my wedding dress at one of those, you know, swanky boutiques.  And these people were just so kind and patient and helpful.  And we do have a customer for life.  Don't worry, Vicki.  The one thing we're not is swanky.  You're going to like the way you look.  I guarantee it.  I'm George Zimmer, founder and CEO of Men's Warehouse.

The photo shoot for the, uh, for the latest contestant in the WOW contest is officially  over, Anthony.  Yes.  Rick took 110 pictures.  A hundred and ten pictures.  There she is now, live in our studio with all her clothes on. 
[02:43:30]  I don't even recognize her with her clothes on, Anthony.  But I, I think, uh, her name's Corinne, uh, you live in New York and stuff and you, and  she does ballet and the, is that what you do?  Ballet and modern dance.  I also, um, do low flying trapeze.  Really?  It's, it's combined with modern dance.  Yeah.  Where are you, where are you from originally though?  Virginia.  Yeah.  A little bit of that accent going on.  Yeah.  Ha ha, Virginia.  She's now from New York and she'll be representing us in the WOW contest.  I live here.  I'm a New Yorker now. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can hear it.  Yeah.  Well, your pictures are just off the hook.  Yeah.  Beautiful.  Thank you.  I had fun.  Rick made me feel very comfortable doing the photo shoot.  Rick's got it.  Isn't he the best?  Yeah.  Rick has a secondary career.  He really should be working for Penthouse.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I might ought to take some of those books for, I mean, uh, pictures for my modeling book.  Yeah.  There you go.  No.  Okay.  I suggest that Scott puts up all 110 pictures.  But I, it was my idea to pour the water on the shirt. 
[02:44:30]  Oh, what?  You've got to be creative and I want to win.  Did Rick tell you to say that so he doesn't get in trouble?  No.  It was my idea.  I swear.  Hey, you don't have to beg for votes like a lot of the other contestants.  Trust me.  Yeah.  Okay.  You're going to do just fine.  I wouldn't even worry about it.  I would, the only thing I'd worry about is how you're spending the five grand.  That's all the worries you need.  And then she wet her hair nice.  No, I don't.  Although, they're real, right?  Mm-hmm.  How old are you?  I'm 30.  You shouldn't ask that.  30?  That's a nice 30.  Well, you know, Dan, I usually, we don't, we usually don't ask girls ages. 
[02:45:00]  We like to kind of tell you your age, but.  No, she totally looks like she's in her 20s.  I don't care.  I look good for 30s, though.  It doesn't matter.  No, you look great.  You look, I wouldn't have, I wouldn't have guessed 30.  No way.  Very nice.  So, wow.  We can't wait to see your pictures on the internet as well.  Are they working feverishly up front to put those on?  Oh, by the way, when will they be on the internet?  Within the end.  Within minutes, hopefully.  Really?  If all our bastard listeners will just stay off the websites, we'll be able to get them up. 
[02:45:30]  Oh, that'll work.  Yeah.  That never works.  So, probably in about an hour.  Oh, okay.  All right?  All right.  We're about 40 minutes away from getting an angry phone call from Sacramento, huh?  How long is the contest?  It's pretty much over now.  Yeah, now that we got quality of the contest, we can start the voting tomorrow.  Oh, I mean, you know, you've raised the bar, let's say.  Oh, thank you very much.  A lot of the girls now that might have shown up are kind of going to look and go, uh-oh.  Like, all right, I'll beat that, I guess. 
[02:46:00]  Okay, I'm definitely ahead of that.  All right, why did she enter?  I like the consent form, though.  I'm ready to be ridiculed or...  Did it say that on the consent form?  The consent form says that now?  The consent form says, um, you know...  I'm ready to be ridiculed.  Oh, my God.  These lords got to calm down.  I didn't even know that.  All right, get out of the studio, because we've got a show to do.  All right.  All right, guys.  You're stopping the show.  Thank you very much.  You're going to ruin the show.  I enjoyed the photoshoot. 
[02:46:30]  Cool.  We enjoyed watching.  All right, there she goes.  Very good.  Beat that!  And that's from New York.  That's right.  Yeah.  Good luck.  I finally can say that I'm proud to be from New York, Anthony.  Yeah.  Usually when we do these contests...  Ooh.  Ah.  E.  Ugh.  I know.  Ugh.  Yeah, get Don West on the phone.  Let's see if there's anything even remotely close to that.  Dallas close.  Boston close.  These other cities are going to have to step way the F up and see what we got. 
[02:47:00]  She said a whole new level.  I love the picture with Norton's face on it.  That's classic.  Is it part of the contestants now?  Oh, no.  Are you kidding?  But as I look at the real picture, it's like, okay.  There's an improvement.  Norton's eyes are so much cuter.  Here's the consent form, Anthony.  Yeah.  This agreement may subject me to risk of notoriety, publicity, ridicule, scorn, and or indignity. 
[02:47:30]  Indignity.  Yeah, because people have problems sometimes if you say things about them, and then they sue.  Whoa.  Casey.  Casey.  Yeah?  What the hell are you doing, man?  What?  Casey.  What?  Uh, me and Davis were sitting around and stuff, and we found a dill.  Casey.  Casey.  Casey.  Hey.  Hey.  How old are you, Casey?  Fourteen.  All right.  Where are you calling from?  He's goofy. 
[02:48:00]  Fourteen, Opie.  Huh?  He's goofy, fourteen.  Yeah.  Yeah, some fourteens are like, hey, man, what's up?  Right.  He's like, uh, fourteen?  And I'm still goofy.  All right, dude.  Casey.  Yeah?  Oh, my God.  Casey.  Have you been going through, um, your, your parents' night tables?  Oh, yeah.  All right, and what'd you find?  Okay, I found, like, uh, a dill.  Yeah?  We're calling a dill.  It's pretty big.  Vibrator.  Oh, it vibrates and it's pretty big?  Yeah.  What does it look like?  It's, like, cylindrical.  Cylindrical. 
[02:48:30]  Cylindrical.  It's bringing his butt head.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's cylindrical.  And what else?  And it vibrates.  Let's hear the vibration.  Let's hear it.  Hello?  And I found some other stuff, too.  Casey, help us out.  Casey, let's hear it.  Turn that damn thing on.  Okay.  And put it against the phone.  Goddamn, we're doomed.  Oh.  He's with his goofy friend. 
[02:49:00]  Hey, Casey.  Yeah?  Are you with your dopey friend?  No.  Who are you with?  That's my mom's boyfriend's son.  Your mom's boyfriend's son?  How old is he?  He's, like, 16.  I'll put him on the phone.  Yeah, Adam.  All right.  What else did you find, by the way?  Oh, I found some, like, arousal bomb.  What?  What is that?  I don't, it says, this is what it says on the side.  All right.  It says, enjoy the delights of enhanced sensitivity and taste as you discover the seductive passions  of ecstasy. 
[02:49:30]  That's pretty cool, huh?  Yeah, and I found some Astroglide.  Astroglide.  Hey, I like the Astroglide.  Good stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Casey.  All right.  Thanks, man.  All right.  All right.  Bye.  His mom's boyfriend's son?  That was a struggle, but it was still worthwhile.  Paul, what's up?  Paul.  Paul.  Paul.  Paulie.  Paulie just got home from work, and he's hiding everything. 
[02:50:00]  I think we put a lot of parents in a state of panic today.  Okay, let's say hi to Don West.  Don West.  Hey, guys.  How you doing, Don?  I am going through my suitcase.  You guys wonder what I found?  What'd you find?  Oh, my God.  We got an incredible thing.  Card.  I got some Barry Bonds rookie cards.  The Marilyn Monroe Jim at rookie card.  I take it everywhere.  Now, Don.  Yeah.  You have an event coming up. 
[02:50:30]  Tonight.  Tonight.  We're talking about a whole new wrestling league.  A brand new.  The NWA TNA.  TNA.  Now, do I...  Total nonstop action.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And this is once a week.  Every Wednesday night.  On pay-per-view.  On in-demand.  Pay-per-view.  Uh-huh.  Or DirecTV.  And you're going to be calling these matches?  I'm calling the match.  You're calling the match.  God damn Don West.  Calling the match.  You're good at this?  I mean, you know all the guys and... 
[02:51:00]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I know all the guys and I've gotten to meet them all down here, too.  But, I mean, I knew most of them anyway just from being a fan.  But they just want me to just react like I would if I pulled out a Sammy Sosa car when I opened a pack.  Oh, my God.  When that happens, let me just open one of these packs up for you.  Let me open...  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  That was unbelievable.  Did you see what he just did?  Yeah.  You know something?  Give me a little example of what it might sound like.  Like, give me a little call from some action, some hypothetical action we might see. 
[02:51:30]  Did that guy just grab that girl's...  Boom!  Like, what did we just see here?  Is that what...  Don, there's some great action going on in the ring.  I don't care.  Look at what's going on over here.  All right.  I'm sold.  I just want to see...  What the hell?  I got to see...  It's going to be awesome, though.  Yeah.  All right, Matt.  Who are some of the guys?  Well, they're going to have a big...  For the main event, there's going to be a 20-man gauntlet for the goal.  Where they're going to have 20 superstars, like Ken Shamrock, the world's most dangerous 
[02:52:00]  man, Jeff Jarrett, Scott Hall.  Yeah.  Buff Bagwell.  All these guys are going to be in the center ring, and, you know, whoever's left after  not getting thrown over the top rope.  Right.  Then they have the big...  The duo to find out who's the brand new NWA champ.  Very good.  Very good.  Then we're going to have the lingerie battle royal.  Oh, and here we go.  Chicks.  Oh, baby.  Yeah.  I get to do a segment with them.  And, actually, that battle will be next week, but we're going to bring them all in and  have a little catfight action going on. 
[02:52:30]  What kind of segment are you doing with them, Don?  Well, somebody's got to go up and introduce them and be up there with them.  Hey, Don, this is where you trump the WWE.  You've got to make sure those girls get very naked.  Well, as far as we can go, anyway.  The WWE, they'll tease us with a side breast shot or something, but, man, you guys got to  go all out.  Any nip on there, Don?  Buddy, I'm hoping I'll be as shocked as the rest of the world.  All right.  But it's going to be great.  Yeah.  Anywhere else we could see on TV these days?  You're selling stuff?  Yeah. 
[02:53:00]  Actually, I'm even there in your neck of the woods.  I do a radio show.  You're on the radio, Don?  Yeah, Sporting News Radio.  We're plugging his radio show.  Well, I do that in the mornings in New York on the weekends.  Oh, on the weekends.  And then I'm going to have a whole brand new set of infomercials coming out next week.  I haven't seen one of these yet.  Yeah, well, we had some in the New York area.  They're one of those hit and misses.  You know, you've just got to be flipping through, and all of a sudden you'll go,  there's the idiot again.  There he is.  I always got goddamn Ron Popeil selling his roasters, that rotisserie stuff. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah, what are you going to be selling?  Oh, man.  Well, right now, a lot of Tiger Woods, you can imagine.  Yeah, very popular.  And then, of course, I'm going to have the big, massive, you know, six, seven hundred  unopened pack deals where I'll, you know, swim in them and open them and pull out all  kinds of good stuff.  Yeah, when you started swimming in the cards, Don, you've got to give us some classic Don  West.  That's what everyone wants to hear today.  Yeah.  Little bit of the, all right.  Give us some classic Don West. 
[02:54:00]  Here it is.  Tiger Woods, Tiger Woods rookie cards.  Sell me, Don.  Now, this isn't just any Tiger Woods rookie cards, folks.  This is the original, the 1997.  I'm not talking about one of the reprints.  I'm not talking about one of those other, the other cards that you saw me selling for  three and four grand.  This is the original, 97 rookie, and it is going to be a gem, man, can this, this card  at one time sold for $100,000 for you guys, $12.16.  All right, Don. 
[02:54:30]  Can I get that on FlexPay?  Seven pay.  I always love that.  I was like, OctiPay, take payments.  OctiPay.  It's only $100,000 a payment.  In fact, you don't even have to pay.  We send it to you.  If you're not satisfied, send it back.  I always liked how you guys would, you'd push the FlexPay, which is, you know, half the  payment.  You'd make two payments.  How many people don't pay the second half either?  And you would make it, you know, you would say FlexPay and make it sound like, so you're 
[02:55:00]  getting all this for $250.  But that's like the first payment.  But you never made it sound like you had to pay the other half.  And you know what?  Some people took it that way, too, when they were listening.  Did they?  No, you didn't.  Come on, send it in.  Come on, send it in.  It's coming out of Don's pocket.  Every now and then, they'd come up to me and say, okay, Don, we're having a bad few months.  Stop the FlexPay.  Or else, let them know that it is two payments.  Yeah, it was very confusing watching you sometimes. 
[02:55:30]  Swimming in the cards.  You're talking about FlexPay.  I don't know what the hell you're doing, Don.  Very entertaining, though.  And we'll look forward to seeing you.  When is that now?  Tonight?  8 o'clock Eastern on in-demand pay-per-view.  Or you have DirecTV.  I think they have a way of getting it, too, on DirecTV.  All right.  Saillight Dish.  And only $9.  Only $9.95.  Not $54 like you saw for the Tyson fighting up.  $39 like these other wrestling events.  $9.95.  There you go. 
[02:56:00]  Well worth the price just to see the immortal Don West.  And the TNA girls dancing in the cages.  Very nice.  In the cages.  You've got to come by and say hi to us, man.  Buddy, I hope to be in New York in about a month.  Oh, you have a seat open right here, Don.  Man, it would be my pleasure, guys.  Very cool, man.  But you're going to have to do the virgin thing again.  Oh, absolutely.  I want you to do it.  We'll bring in virgins and you can sell them.  Look at the ass on this one. 
[02:56:30]  Don, how would you do the snare drum?  I still got that.  I was able to get that when you guys sent it to the other people.  And I was able to get it.  I mean, that's a party buster.  I'm going to tell you that right now.  Cool.  Cool.  All right, Don.  Thank you.  Thanks, Don.  Thanks, guys.  Okay.  Bye.  There he goes.  It's tough on the phone.  A lot of people want to talk to Don West.  We'll get him in here live and we'll do the whole thing.  Oh, live would just be insane.  That was very funny, though, when he's going off on the tiger list.  Oh, hell yeah.  These were selling for $100,000.  I was ready to pull out my wallet and start calling.  I hear his voice.  I just want to spend money.  Josh and Matt, what's up? 
[02:57:00]  Guys.  Josh.  Hey.  Hey, what's up, Matt?  You're on the radio.  Oh, hey.  Hold on.  They're snooping, Anthony.  You're with your brother?  Yeah.  And you're how old?  I'm 13.  Okay.  What's going on?  Hold on.  Yeah.  Hold on, he says.  The radio.  Who is that?  Uh-oh.  Did he get busted?  Are you in trouble?  Matt?  Yes.  What happened?  Oh, my parents are right there. 
[02:57:30]  Well, what are you doing?  I want my parents to get out of here.  Well, you can't do it while your parents are there.  You're going to get screwed.  I've got to go.  Oh.  Hey, she just picked up the phone.  Did you hear it?  Yeah, they got busted, man.  Let's go to Pete.  Hey, Pete, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hey, what's up?  What's up?  Hey, uh, you guys, I'm snooping.  You're snooping right now?  Okay.  Yeah.  Uh, so far, my mom's drawer, I got K.Y. jelly and, uh, tampons. 
[02:58:00]  And, uh, my dad's drawer, I just got condoms.  He's pretty boring, I guess.  Yeah.  But, uh, I really don't want to know what my mom's doing with the K.Y. jelly.  Well, you know.  Uh, see you guys later, man.  All right, Pete.  Thank you.  All right, see you.  One more, Anthony.  Then we're going to move on and talk about Chelsea next, okay?  Drunk in Chelsea.  Uh, who's snooping through the drawers here?  The, the, the, the Vita.  Hey, what's up, guys?  The Vita.  Check it in again.  What's up, The Vita? 
[02:58:30]  Hey, how's it going?  So, I'm in my mom's drawer, right?  Yeah.  And I find a picture of myself.  And right next to that, I find a shotgun.  Something, uh, oh, man.  A shotgun and three suicide notes.  I messed that line so up.  I was going to say muscle accidents.  It would have been brilliant.  Take the bit out of your mouth, The Vita.  Man, I'm effing up these things big time.  Can I be a spider in this extrashand thing?  Uh, possibly.  Nice.  It's that big-nosed, you, mule, god-wing, faggot, comedy, kryptonite voice.  All right. 
[02:59:00]  Thank you, The Vita.  Later.  Bye.  It goes, The Vita.  Okay.  Chelsea Clinton getting drunk.  Yes.  Next.  Let them hang like the animals they are.  Y.S.P.  Unstoppable with Howard Stern Morning.  Oh, my God.  I love Howard Stern.

By the way, the hot streak is over, boys.  Yeah, the Sacramento hot streak is over 
[03:09:30]  as far as contest checks go.  But outside of New York City,  866-2774-WOW.  A big thank you to all the girls  that have been wowing today.  Getting lots of reports all over the place.  We could do like a four-hour show  with girls just calling up,  you know, wowing.  But we listen to our faithful listeners,  and they think that's kind of boring.  We all know what's happening out there,  so thank you.  The occasional having the girls call up, though,  and be on the phone as they wow, 
[03:10:00]  give a little two to the horn thing,  that's kind of cool.  We'd appreciate that.

That address is up on opiananthony.com.  So Chelsea Clinton,  there's some pictures of her  in the Star magazine.  Completely wasted, Anthony. 
[03:10:30]  Yes, the Star, the Inquirer,  things like that, great.  Remember when that used to be the place  where people would go,  oh, that's so fake.  And unless it's in the real newspaper,  it's not going to be true.  The Star, the Inquirer,  oh, that's all fake stuff.  Now you read stuff in the Star and Inquirer,  and you know it is the truth.  Because they get sued now,  and it's a lie.  And the people that they talk about  never do anything these days.  They just take it, because it's true. 
[03:11:00]  It's true.  Well, these pictures they got of Chelsea Clinton.  She is just snotted.  Apparently she's taken to  hanging out in London.  London's Embassy Club is this latest one.  With her beau, her fiancé, her boyfriend.  They say he looks like a young Clinton.  Is that what they're saying?  They've said that many times.  Well, you know something.  With the curly hair and stuff.  Looks like a young Bill Clinton.  I didn't even think about it,  but look at the guy.  Yeah. 
[03:11:30]  Yeah.  Looks like that Oxford,  I'm running away from the Vietnam War era,  Clinton.  Doesn't he?  Well, she was out with him.  Is this really a big deal, though?  No, not for any other 22-year-old girl.  I think well over 90% of us,  we were that plastered.  Yeah, but not when you're Chelsea Clinton.  I don't care if they're humans.  This was the last little part of the myth of that family. 
[03:12:00]  You know, you had the myth that Bill Clinton was this great leader  and a great president,  honed since he was a young child,  even his middle name Jefferson,  named after Thomas Jefferson,  that he was going to be this great president.  A picture of him with Kennedy.  Yeah.  Him with Kennedy.  You know, he was destined to become the president.  Our own young Ben has a picture with Clinton.  Oh, stop it.  So maybe Ben's the next president.  Is he holding that big luscious mule?  Well, Norton isn't here.  I figured I'd add that in.  Ben has a picture in his apartment of him with Clinton. 
[03:12:30]  You do?  I've got to call him out on him.  Wow.  It's framed nicely and stuff.  But it's so obvious.  Taken in Boston, Massachusetts, was it?  Of course it was.  Where was it?  No, it was taken in D.C., right?  Oh, that was Boston?  Dude, the photograph is so blurry.  It's not in frame.  And it's obvious that Clinton has no clue that Ben's anywhere near him.  So what?  It's like, dude, I've got a picture with me and Clinton, man.  I've got to check it out.  Did Bill get a call that night?  Bill, it's Ben. 
[03:13:00]  How you doing?  I'm out.  We're hanging, dude.  Why don't you come on down?  We're just hanging out on the lambs on the street.  Woo!  Go Sox, Yankee Sox, Bill.  He would, I guarantee he would probably be into that.  No, it's a photo with him coming down the line.  I've got to tie him by him.  It's actually a pretty cool photo.  But so you know, when he goes to these things, I mean, he has an obligation when you're in  a certain area, you shake everyone's hand.  But he's got to go like a million miles per minute, you know, flying by people.  But I'll say this one thing about him.  The guy looks at you. 
[03:13:30]  When you look into his eyes, when you're that close, there's something.  Yeah.  No, I don't mean it that way.  That's not what I meant.  That's not what I meant.  Did you ever sleep with Quentin in a tree fort?  Ben, you're not going to admit that you had a fake sleep, man.  Can I give you a m-cha?  Oh, I'm sleeping, Bill.  When you look into those powerful eyes, when you look into that fly.  Yeah, well, let's ask Ben.  What do you see in those eyes? 
[03:14:00]  Shut up.  What is it, actually?  Shut up.  Oh, we're with you.  Power.  No, there's something in his eyes.  Something, no, and you know what?  I know a lot of people that have, you know, a lot of different people that said the same  thing.  He's just, he's got something that he looks at you and you feel like, holy cow.  You got charisma.  Now he just hangs out over at the, you know, at the Hudson Hotel.  Banging hot blondes upstairs.  Is that pretty much it?  Yeah.  He's over there with the models and stuff.  That was his myth, though, that this was going to be the first young president. 
[03:14:30]  That whole thing.  You know what I mean?  And then it turns out, well, you know, he had his little shady times in the presidency.  The other myth was his wife, Hillary.  She was the always faithful, the woman behind the man.  The shoulder, the rock for him that will be there when he needs that family time.  Where are you going with this?  No one was buying any of this crap ever.  You are so full of it.  They absolutely were. 
[03:15:00]  The week before they went on TV the first time.  All right.  This was how the family was presented by the Democrats.  You could look at them and realize they were a family in turmoil.  No.  Not really.  When they handled that first sex scandal thing before he was even elected and they asked  him about, you know, Mr. Quentin, did you have any indiscretions during your marriage?  Well, let me tell you something there, Elmer Fudd.  And they explained it away like, you know, and she's looking at them all doting. 
[03:15:30]  And she turns out to just, you know, it's a loveless marriage.  That's obvious.  She has her own power hunger that's insatiable and a hunger for muff.  That's insatiable.  Let you leave.  No, I'm saying it now.  And then there was Chelsea.  Now, this was the kid that grew up under the microscope in the White House, very young  when she got in there. 
[03:16:00]  And with everything that went on, she was the one that turned out OK.  That's all I'm saying.  She's still turning out OK.  How do you know?  She just got hammered.  I think she's like 29 years old now.  How old is she?  She's 22.  All right.  I think she's like 45 or whatever.  But I mean, she's allowed to go out and get plastered.  You know something?  Not really.  What?  Not really.  Why not?  You can go out and have some drinks.  But look at this.  The pictures.  Let me go through. 
[03:16:30]  First picture.  Picture any dumpy chick walking toward you in a bar with the half-masked cuckoo eyes and  the mouth open like she's saying, hey.  And even in a still picture, when you look like you're staggering in a still picture, that  is amazing.  Yeah.  She is hammered.  Picture number two.  Her boyfriend, Chelsea's arm is around his neck.  The Secret Service is putting a coat over her head. 
[03:17:00]  Right.  And another Secret Service guy is putting his hand up as to say to the camera, no, stop.  Please don't take that picture.  I will kill you.  Meanwhile, the British paparazzi killed their own princess.  This ain't nothing for them.  They're not going to stop.  Picture three.  She hangs on to Ian as he drags her into the waiting car.  As he wants to get some action.  Picture four. 
[03:17:30]  Let me see picture four again.  Tells of volumes.  It's Ian barks orders that the former first daughter tries to pull herself together in  the limo.  You know he's just going, the puss is here.  You be cool.  You're making an idiot of yourself.  You're a drunk.  Would you knock it off?  Stop it.  I'm here at Watch Hill with my parents and you are making a drunken idiot of yours.  Anthony.  Oh, sorry.  Ooh.  Where the hell did that come from?  Wow.  Anthony.  We're talking about Chelsea here. 
[03:18:00]  Gee, that's, wow.  That came out of nowhere.  Hmm.  You know what Chelsea barked at the driver?  Huh?  Three rights make a left.  Right.  It was very embarrassing for Ian.  So here he is.  Look at Chelsea's face.  Come on.  Which one are we looking at now?  Picture four.  She is.  He is.  Pissed.  She is.  Know why he's pissed?  Yeah.  Because he knows he's not getting any from Chelsea.  Of course not. 
[03:18:30]  Because she is about, I say, 15 or 20 minutes from puking right there.  And he, see, he effed up, dude.  This has happened to all of us.  You're with your chick and stuff.  And she's getting a little happy, a little loose.  And you're feeding her drinks, right?  The alcohol curve.  But you never know when to stop feeding her the drinks.  There's that fine line.  You don't know as a kid.  More drinks, more gooder.  How many times have you been in a bar with your girl and she's really hammered and you're  thinking to yourself, man, the monkey sex we're going to have tonight, she's feeling 
[03:19:00]  extra good.  And then all something, something happens.  She drops off the cliff.  Yeah.  And then instead of having a really good night, you have one of the worst nights of your life  because you have to kind of hold her head up as she's puking all night.  That's what's going on in that picture right there.  He's thinking right there, I can't wait to get home.  Yeah.  Next picture, well, he starts the action.  He's trying to kiss her and she falls.  Her head goes in a bad way right into his lap.  Right into his lap.  In that bad, I'm just hammered way.  And at this point, he's going, oh, I'm done. 
[03:19:30]  It's going to be a long night.  The drinking curve, when you're out like that, you were talking about that, the time  it takes from the first drink to the time where you're at peak buzz for action, and I'm  talking about the girl, is a lot longer than the time it takes to get from peak time for  action to there is nothing but you holding my head and me puking.  And that time, it happens very quickly. 
[03:20:00]  That turns very quickly.  I thought it would be a good idea one time.  And we're stupid.  All we have to do is stop the shots and everything else.  You've got to realize early on in the night, she is in a perfect place.  This is a perfect place.  You don't understand.  There are some girls that you can't cut them off.  So you see that they're at prime time, or even better, if you noticed beforehand, but  that they've been doing some, and you go, if I stop her now, she's going to peak.  You know what I mean?  She's already done some.  So she's still got to peak. 
[03:20:30]  So if I cut her off now, but it's like, where's the other shot?  So you've got to stop her way below prime time.  I knew a girl knowing that the prime time is still going to kick in, the extra alcohol, right?  We were hanging out in this park, out on Long Island.  It's what you used to do as kids, you know.  She decides she wants Bacardi 151, Opie.  Now, I don't even drink 151.  I never have, because it's brutal.  It is a brutal, brutal rum.  So much alcohol.  It's 151 proof. 
[03:21:00]  So she's doing shots of this stuff.  And I see, all right, you know, we're going to get somewhere here.  You know, things are happening.  It's going to work out good.  She fell off like she went over a waterfall.  It happened that fast.  It went from, I am going to take you and blah, blah.  You're going to take my blah, blah, blah?  My what?  No, go back, and then you try to get the moment back.  No, but what were you saying? 
[03:21:30]  You're like, oh, my God.  I had to take her home.  Yeah.  I get a call, 2 in the morning.  Were you a living animal house?  No, I get a call at 2 in the morning from her father.  My phone rings.  Not the, what the F did you do to my daughter?  Anthony.  Oh, boy.  What the F did you do to my daughter?  Swear to God.  I think we've all had that. 
[03:22:00]  I got this, I got this, and then, of course, I'm like, nothing.  Why?  What were you two drinking?  Cokes.  We were drinking Coca-Cola.  She may have gotten a bad one.  I heard that if the packaging plant had some mold in it, she could act intoxicated.  And we had some chicken wings, and she might have got food poisoning.  The Coke don't have to burn on date.  You ought to get one of them burn on dates. 
[03:22:30]  How about you know if it's good when you're eating it or drinking it?  Because she, she was acting a little peculiar when I took her home.  Oh, I see where you're going with this.  Anthony, you've been drinking with my daughter.  Oh, no.  Not a, except for the Cokes.  We were drinking the Coca-Cola.  He was having none of it.  I sat there the whole night.  It was the second scariest night I ever spent in my life.  You told a lot of great stories today. 
[03:23:00]  Again, I had a sleepless night.  Yet it wasn't that scary.  Hold on, so the gay thing was the scariest night of your life?  That was not the scariest night, but it was one of the most uncomfortable, like, oh, my God, I want this night to get over with really quick.  But when I went to bed that night.  I love the fact that there's a whole new audience every 20 minutes for this show.  Yeah.  There's a lot of people out there that think you just had gay sex.  Oh, and I slept with the gay guy earlier in the show?  That story?  But I was waiting for, you know, I laid down in bed, going to sleep, and I'm just listening. 
[03:23:30]  I'm listening to the silence of Long Island just waiting.  Waiting to hear the sirens pull up to my house.  Waiting.  Why?  Because I was sure he was calling the cops.  She was underage?  Well, yeah.  We both were.  Okay.  And I thought maybe if she was dead, because I dropped her off, and her older sister, who I had gone out with, like, a couple of years ago and hated me, 
[03:24:00]  sees me drag her drunken younger daughter into the house.  She was pissed.  This was only a couple of years ago?  No.  Well, you said a couple of years ago.  No, I said I had dated her a couple of years before that.  Ah.  No, it's going back.  Like, pfft.  Jesus Christ.  Opie, that was 1945.  I was fresh back from the war.  The big one.  We crushed the Nazis.  I'll tell you about it.  Hold on.  Trader Jake wants in.  Trader Jake.  Hey, guys.  How you doing today?  Pretty good. 
[03:24:30]  Hey, you're talking about the stage when the girl's really hammered like that?  Yeah.  We call it landing the plane.  You got to know when to land the plane.  Wow.  Oh, I'm going to remember that.  It's the difference between, uh, this is the captain speaking.  We're coming into the Caribbean, a smooth landing.  Right.  Versus, oh, Jesus Christ, we're going down.  It happens very quickly.  That's right.  Hey, Anthony, you're not sleeping, are you?  Shut up.  Landing the plane. 
[03:25:00]  Very good.  Landing the plane.  Okay.  You got to know when that time is, that drop-off period.  Dan from Hoboken wants to know if Ian reached into Chelsea's bra only to reveal tissue paper.  Well, I guess I got a lot of catching up to do.  Remember that in Animal House?  Yeah.  Yeah, so she was out on a binge, and Bill and Hillary, very concerned about Chelsea's drinking,  they say.  Oh, stop. 
[03:25:30]  She likes her champagne cocktails, martinis, and vodka drinks.  And after getting a good buzz, she stopped off for some Thai food.  Ugh.  Boy, come...  You know what Thai food's like coming up?  Mount Vesuvius.  That'll hurt.  You better have some Tums before you boof that up.  She stumbled into the bathroom, and I'm sure she was throwing up, one source says.  Seems like she, uh, she was boofing, boofing in the bathroom. 
[03:26:00]  She emerged a few minutes later looking dazed, drunk, and pale-faced.  Several times, the confused Chelsea made her way into the club's coat room.  Hey, that's a good night.  It was all fiancé Ian could do to keep her from falling down.  God damn, man.  This is...  I was looking at the names.  I wanted to see where my name was on this one. 
[03:26:30]  It became clear to everyone that, uh, they had to get Chelsea out before she drank any more.  See, she's at the bush.  You don't know when to stop.  Unable to walk on her own two feet.  Ian and several other guys, who may have been secret service agents, threw the coat overhead,  carried her out to the car at about 3 a.m.  She immediately passed out and slumped forward on the seat,  falling face-first into her boyfriend's lap.  Her friends had to pick up her legs and put them into the car. 
[03:27:00]  Oh, those big, fat, Hillary-like calves.  Oh, and this is where it gets really funny.  Sources say Bill and his U.S. Senator wife, Hillary, were upset and worried  when they learned that their beloved daughter had passed out from drinking.  They decided that Hillary should call Chelsea the next day  and give her a good transatlantic talking to.  There's some mothering. 
[03:27:30]  This Hillary is so self-centered, that was the reason for her whole marriage to Bill  and every, so self-centered, that the daughter means nothing to her.  It's all about her career.  So she gives her a good transatlantic talking to.  Sources tell the star Hillary also spoke to Chelsea's Secret Service agents  and asked them to step in if she does anything like this in the future.  Ordinarily, the agents don't get involved in situations like this.  Their job is to protect Hillary's, or Chelsea's security, 
[03:28:00]  not monitor her booze intake.  So friends say this is a sign of how serious Bill and Hillary take the drinking issue.  Asking the Secret Service to step in if she gets too drunk again.  How about talking to her yourself?  Wow, that's serious.  They're telling other people to stop her from drinking.  The sad and disturbing incident isn't the first time.  The redhead grad student has overdone it with the booze. 
[03:28:30]  She got drunk on Red Bull and vodka one night.  Well, who hasn't?  Who does that?  Yeah, I know.  I remember one road trip we did.  I believe it was our sticker stop we did in the bus,  where our own Stinky was drinking the Red Bull and the vodka.  And he fell face first into Rick's lap that night.  It's not a big deal, though, Ant.  While on the dance floor, she got so carried away with herself, 
[03:29:00]  her halter top fell down, exposing her breasts.  Instead of being embarrassed, she laughed it off,  pulled up her top, and kept on dancing.  Chelsea also recently seen buying two pregnancy kits.  And those closer are worried that with all her boozing,  she may make a mistake and end up with an unplanned pregnancy.  Oh, stop.  She's probably using little test tubes or shot glasses,  that drunken bitch. 
[03:29:30]  Test tube shots.  Hey, Dave, what's up?  Yo.  Hey.  What's up, guys?  I've got the key to getting in the girls' pants, man.  When you're out drinking with her, you've got to leave.  At the moment, she starts peaking.  You know, you'll have about an hour, hour and a half  before she really comes down off of it.  Yeah.  So by the time you get home, you have a few more drinks,  and you're in like Flynn, dude.  I don't know about that.  And another thing for Anthony.  I think Anthony's right.  When she's peeking at the bar, it's already too late.  Absolutely.  And another thing for Anthony, if he wants to know this. 
[03:30:00]  No.  Sorry, sir.  What's that?  Sorry, sir.  No, no.  Seriously.  No.  No.  He sucks.  All right.  He was too eager.  And one more thing.  If Anthony wants to know, please say what?  Please say what?  Please.  No, sir.  No.  Really?  I can salvage it.  I can salvage it.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on?  Could you almost picture Chelsea pulling an, I want to go home?  Oh, my God.  Ian's out.  Ian.  Bye.  Ian.  I want to go home.  Two rights make a left.  Chelsea.  Oh, my God. 
[03:30:30]  Chelsea's going to kill me.  Chelsea's going to kill me.  Hi, Mrs. Clinton.  I want to go home.  Shut up.  Chelsea, I'm out, and I want to hang out with my friends.  We're hanging out here, Chelsea, and I think maybe if you didn't drink so much, we'd be able  to hang a little, I don't care, I want to go home, I want to go home, I want to go home.  Get me Air Force One.  Three right bank turns make a left bank turn. 
[03:31:00]  You don't even need your rudder.  I want to go home.  There have been those nights, though.  You know when they got to stop.  You know when they should cut it off.  And there have been nights, though, where, you know, I've sat around and bullcrapped  with guys talking about those situations where you get, like, hammered.  It's happened to all of us.  Have you ever gotten so drunk, and you and your chick just hammered drunk, and you're 
[03:31:30]  going at it, and all of a sudden, you wake up, and, like, you're still moving?  Yes.  And you're like, what?  I took a little doze there.  I dozed off, but my body knew what to do.  I was on autopilot.  Did I just quantum leap?  Or all of a sudden, you're, you know, you're working, you're working something, you're working  it, and you wake up because you can't breathe through your nose anymore because it fell in  the stew. 
[03:32:00]  Now, I will reiterate, this has not happened in many years.  You live, you learn, and you realize how to avoid these situations.  But when you're camping in upstate New York or something, and the only thing you're eating  are hot dogs and, what the hell is that, Southern Comfort, bottles of Southern Comfort,  straight, wham, playing drinking games with it.  When it comes time to bed down, you're just like, what? 
[03:32:30]  Uh, it's the funniest thing, though.  You're like, huh, you wake up, and your hips are going, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.  Like, wow, I'm like an oil derrick.  You don't even need the maintenance guy there.  He's just going to keep pumping the oil all night.  All night!  All night!  But it's true.  It happens.  You've got to do that. 
[03:33:00]  You wake up the next morning, and the car goes, did we have sex last night?  Because I didn't really notice anything.  Yeah, turn around and check.  Yeah, you were that hammered.  He calls it landing the planes.  I'm glad you just switched to autopilot.  Bye.  This effing's going autopilot right now.  We're going to top off right here at about a medium-paced stroke, and I'm going to take a snooze. 
[03:33:30]  I'll see you in about five or ten minutes.  Anthony, we've got to go to Sacramento.  We've been waiting for this call all day.  Steve!  Hey, this is Steve from Sacramento, California.  Hey, man.  Hey, we've got some girls out here that put Stocker Patties of Shame wearing drag.  Yeah.  You guys keep rocking Sacramento.  Well, that's not why you called.  Was it?  No?  No. 
[03:34:00]  Hell no.  Hey, we've got pretty good-looking girls out here in Sacramento.  Well, you guys had the best-looking girls ever for the last contest.  You know what?  There's beautiful girls all over.  Steve, the hot streak is over.  Hot streak over.  It's all good.  Hot streak is over.  Go to openanthony.com to check out all the contestants in the WOW Contest.  Hot streak over.  Hey, don't hate the game.  Hate the player.  All right, Steve.  Bye.  There you go, G.  Wait till you see what represents New York in the next hour or so.  All right.  I want to step aside.  What do we got? 
[03:34:30]  Wow.  Look at the time.  Jesus Christ.  You know what?  I think we did some things today.  Hey, a little bit of fun almost.  I think we're getting back to doing a real radio show.  Kind of nice.  Did we actually get to two things that we said we were going to get to today?  Yeah, we did the Chelsea thing and the video thing.  The J-Lo thing.  And then we did a little snooping thing.  All right.  Listen to Best Of for the next three days or two days because we don't even have to come in now.  We didn't do the fake-o today, though.  We didn't do the six o'clock queef.  We'll get those back. 
[03:35:00]  Takes a while.  That is funny, though, man.  It's so true, man.  You know, everyone's been there.  Oh, that, too.  I've heard about guys that do this.  Larry on Line 9, wife got too drunk, so I banged her when she passed out.  I've heard this from guys.  Married guys do this all the time.  You get a little guilty, though.  You feel a little guilt.  You feel a little guilt?  No crap.  Larry.  Yes. 
[03:35:30]  What's going on?  What's up, tools?  You've done this now to your wife when she's passed out?  Dude, she thought she was going to be the hottest thing drinking.  I'm doing shots, lemon drops.  Yeah.  She's coming over, licking my ear, grabbing my mule.  I'm thinking it's going to be great.  She ends up puking all over herself.  I've got to clean her up.  She passed out.  I put her in the bed.  I have to take her pants off.  Now, I'm getting so...  Worked up.  ...browsed.  Yep. 
[03:36:00]  I figured, you know what?  She's got me so worked up.  I'm just going to...  She was asking for it.  That is sick.  She didn't even know.  Until this day, she still doesn't know.  That's sick.  Yeah.  There's always that...  No guilt at all.  You ever had this happen where you're both really hammered and you start, you know, doing  the thing there, and then she falls asleep, and then you're in the middle of it?  It's like a moral dilemma.  What do you do?  Do you finish?  You finish. 
[03:36:30]  I can't.  You know what?  I can't.  I'll tell you something.  I've got two girls passed out on me.  If you finish, you'll feel pretty guilty about it.  But before you finish, you're like, I have to do this.  No.  The best thing is to just crank away in the bathroom.  Yeah.  Because after you're done, it won't matter to you as much.  I've been in that situation.  Rich doing the leaning back of the chair with his eyes closed.  The dead woman oscillation. 
[03:37:00]  I always have to bail.  Oh, God.  I always have to bail, Ant.  Yeah, you can't do it.  No.  And then you get so boned.  You're like, oh, man, this is pretty good.  Very funny.  Anthony, when you're falling asleep, just have the second girl in your bed smack you in  your face.  Smart ass.  All right.  And I think a lot of guys got an education today, which is good. 
[03:37:30]  I'm already seeing some pretty good what do we learn.  All right.  We'll do a little more show, and we'll do some what do we learn next.  Now, the WOW report.  Sources close to OB and Anthony say that the WOW sticker is your guarantee of plump, firm  breasts.  We found out different.  Let's go to the tape.  Check these out, sonny.  Grandma, no!

I will now use versatility in a sentence.  When it comes to versatility, the new Dodge Caravan is full of it.  Caravan is the only minivan to offer two power sliding doors and a power rear hatch, plus  a roomy interior with up to 972 seating configurations to prevent seating boredom, which is important  when you're dealing with small children or large animals. 
[03:39:30]  And every new Caravan is backed by the Dodge Powertrain Pledge.  Seven years or 100,000 miles of engine and transmission protection that you don't get from Ford, GM, Honda, or Toyota.  And now there's a $2,500 cash allowance or 0% financing on Caravan, which brings up the word frugality  from the Latin word frugalitas, which in Caravan's case means saving some serious shekels.

You may be having a hard time seeing why a little rock has such a high price tag.  That's okay.  Most women don't see the value in titanium golf clubs or graphite fishing rods.  The fact is, nothing you'll ever buy will last as long or mean so much to her.  And it's not about how big the diamond is or how much it costs. 
[03:41:30]  Her engagement ring has to be right.  The perfect diamond in a ring that seems to speak her name.  At Robbins Diamonds, you'll know when it's right.

No.  The part about big corporations paying less income taxes than a family.  Well, New Jersey has loopholes that huge corporations are exploiting to avoid paying their fair share. 
[03:45:30]  So while families and small businesses shell out thousands in taxes,  major corporations are getting away with paying as little as $200 a year.  $200, that's it?  I pay like $1,600 a year in state taxes, and some corporation with millions in profits pays $200?  Right.  Sounds wrong to me.  What can we do about it?  Call your legislator to close the corporate tax loopholes, because it's time for big corporations to pay their fair share for New Jersey.

[03:47:00]  Oh, no.  Hurry up.  Oh, no.  I got it up over here.  Oh, no.  Not picture from the top one.  I bow to Rick today.  Two, three, four.  I bow to Rick today.  I bow to Rick today.  A lot of times we make fun of him because he spends a lot of time with these ladies when they  come in for their photo shoots.  Well, the girl that's going to be representing New York in the WOW Contest, one of many girls  that will end up representing New York in the WOW Contest.  Yeah.  Her pictures are up.  Corinne, was it?  She's going to win the whole damn thing.  This is going to be a tough nut to crack, this one. 
[03:47:30]  Go to opianthony.com.  We took 110 photos.  We got five of the best ones up on opianthony.com right now.  The rest of the photos have been handed off to Steve from foundrymusic.com.  I highly recommend, Steve, that you put every single picture up on foundrymusic.com tonight.  Who's beating her?  Who's beating her?  No one I see on the contest yet.  You can still qualify, ladies.  You just show up at the radio station that we broadcast on. 
[03:48:00]  And they will take your WOW pictures.  They'll send them off to us.  We'll put them up on opianthony.com.  Eventually, the voting will be in the listeners' hands.  And one lady's going to walk away with $5,000, courtesy of risquevideo.com.  R-I-S-Q-R-I-S risque.  Oh, yeah.  R-I-S-Q-U-E video.com.  Risquevideo.com.  Can you get her pictures up? 
[03:48:30]  Yeah, look at this one.  They're ridiculous.  You know, it's good about, especially in a WOW contest like that.  This girl has some, she got some body to her.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Like, she's not a rail, but she's perfectly proportioned.  She's one of those big Nordic women.  Not big, but one of those Nordic women.  Very well put together, as they say.  Yeah, she's beautiful.  I hear there's a couple more contestants up, too, from Chicago.  Yeah.  I know when I see them, because we're too busy looking at Corinne's pictures. 
[03:49:00]  Oh, is there one from Chicago, too?  Let's go to Chicago.  Real fast.  Oh, you went too far.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  I went too far.  Oh, boy.  I give props to Chicago, though.  I think they got three or four girls in the contest.  Yeah.  Already.  This was the one where Rick was telling her, now, just take the top off slowly.  All right.  Look at me.  That is a good one.  The site is just getting slammed, so I guess we'll have to check out the Chicago pictures 
[03:49:30]  after the show.  Wow.  You can almost see right through the undergarment.  Yeah.  Look at that.  Rick did a great job of these photos.  Oh, look.  Yeah, I know.  Dude, I got those off.  Hold on, Rick.  What?  I said I got those off.  If you look at picture number three when she's standing up against the wall.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Way to go, Chicago.  Number two.  I didn't know Chris Farley had a sister.  Stop it.  Holy Christ.  That was a Chicago reference, Anthony. 
[03:50:00]  John, stop dropping the cards all the time.  Yeah, John.  It's getting annoying.  Yeah, John.  Jesse Efter.  Yeah, okay.  What do you think?  That's the funniest thing.  Who got them that time?  Who got them that time?  Ben again?  Yeah.  Ben, you got to get the other girl up.  Well, we start the what do we learn process here.  Chris, what's going on?  What's up, guys? 
[03:50:30]  Hey.  Hi, man.  Yeah, I learned a few quick things today.  Okay.  Keep the cop knows what his mom tastes like.  Keep the cop knows what his mom tastes like.  Oh, jeez.  I learned the real reason Anthony confused his anniversary with swallowing.  Swallowing day.  Swallowing day.  Even for Chelsea, three rights make a left.  Yeah.  And Ant turned down a squaw for oral treats from Richard.  Now, he was 14.  Your girlfriend's 14.  Is that just a coincidence?  I did not get oral treats from Richard.  Hey, Ope, we need more stories from your childhood. 
[03:51:00]  All we know about you is like you cement bag your lunch and you banged a Wookiee or something.  No, I backed off lately.  All right.  Later, guys.  I've shared way too much about my childhood.  Hey, wow.  What's the girl from Chicago drinking for?  Later.  You had a body like that, wouldn't you?  No.  Stop it.  She's on her face and she looks like Bobby Fleckman.  And the other girl representing Chicago, absolutely beautiful.  Beautiful.  Which one is she?  Jennifer.  All right.  Let me punch that up.  Jennifer is very nice. 
[03:51:30]  Check this out.  I don't think she's going to be in New York, but she's beautiful.  Oh, no.  I can't get that.  Oh, no.  Well, whatever.  After the show, you guys, go to opianthony.com and foundrymusic.com for all the fun.  And also vote to decide if Lady Di should stay with the show.  That poll is up.  Hey, Bobby Bigrigger.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What's up?  A couple of them real quick.  I learned if a guy offers Anthony Earl treats, he'll do his best Three Stooges invitation.  Yes.  Also, 14-year-olds have no idea what their mom's doing with K-Y Jelly. 
[03:52:00]  Right.  And I think that's about it.  Hey, is that one Batchworthy?  That latest contestant?  Batchworthy?  Yeah.  You're not going to believe the pictures when you see them for yourself.  Good deal.  I'll check it out when we get to the house.  Unbelievable.  We're starting to get quality into this contest.  All right.  I'd also like to thank the young lady in the red Honda southbound Gordon State Parkway.  All right.  Thank you, Bobby.  Later, guys.  We're, of course, wowing.  We could do that all day long with the wow thing. 
[03:52:30]  I should tell the ladies, the voting's not going to start until we get at least 100 women.  And we're up to about 20.  21.  We need 100 women.  That's our goal in this contest.  Derek, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I learned today that it's not gay if you don't wake up.  When Gary Coleman's still on hold.  Yes, he is.  Let's go to the...  Yeah.  All right.  Neil, what's going on?  Not much.  What's going on, boys?  Hey.  I learned 11-year-old Amber was very fortunate.  Little Jimmy Norton had a day off. 
[03:53:00]  No ass.  We were all biting our lips and our tongs to shut our mouths.  All right.  I'm out, boys.  Be good.  All right.  Let's go to Mark.  Hey, Mark.  What's up?  Oh, what's up, boys?  Hey.  I learned two things.  I learned that Opie couldn't measure up to his dad and that Anthony can snore and give  the whale eye at the same time.  I'll share another story.  Snore and give the whale eye, you dick.  That's a great idea.  And I agree with what you said earlier, Andy.  Nope.  No.  All right, Mark.  See you later, boys.  Thank you. 
[03:53:30]  Very good, though.  I told the Bronx Zoo story, too.  The Bronx Zoo.  My dad took our whole family to the Bronx Zoo.  I'm one of seven.  And, you know, I wasn't developing like everyone my age.  I developed really late.  I didn't start developing until I was like in 11th grade.  Real late.  It was ridiculous.  But were you still like just the skinny, dopey little kid?  I was 5'2", 91 pounds in 10th grade.  Do the math.  Now I'm about, what, six foot?  And were you all hairless like young Will Robinson? 
[03:54:00]  Oh, dear.  So I'm like, what the F is going on?  So we're at the Bronx Zoo and we're going, my dad has to take a leak and I had to take  a leak and I think another one of my brothers had to take a leak.  Ah, dad and the boys going in.  And we're, you know, side by side at the stalls there.  And I know what I was packing.  Absolutely nothing.  And I'm like, oh, come on.  What's, you know?  So I took a peek.  Oh.

This is a message for George.  And I'm a spoiled customer of one of the better known men's stores in New York City.  However, I went to Men's Warehouse for the first time recently.  And I bought several suits and sport jackets.  They were tailored perfectly. 
[03:56:30]  My hat is off to you because the other question mark I had about Men's Warehouse was whether or not the quality was up to some of the better stores in the United States.  And I tell you what, there is no doubt you have a new customer in Maine.  Your quality, your cuts, your suits, and the price combined with the service, just no wonder you're so successful.  But my hat's off to you.  There are other retailers in the industry that should learn from you.  And congratulations on doing a great job.  My hat's off to you.  I take it you like wearing hats, or at least taking them off.  You're going to like the way you look.  I guarantee it.

Until he became the number one suspect. 
[03:57:30]  I have a warrant that says you're going to commit future murder.  He set me up.  Who's the victim?  I've never heard of him, but I'm supposed to kill him in less than 36 hours.  No.  To prove his innocence.  He's not going to kill anyone.  How can you avoid a man you never met?  The ultimate cop.  Who set this up?  I don't know.  Maybe he didn't hear me.  We'll have to beat the perfect system.  Fire him up!  Time Magazine says Minority Report is the finest of the season's action epics.
