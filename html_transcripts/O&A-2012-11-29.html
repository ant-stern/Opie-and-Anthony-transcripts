<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about the Powerball lottery, featuring humorous, and at times vulgar, speculation about what the hosts would do if they won, including sexually explicit jokes.  One host revealed he’d matched one number on his on-air lottery pick.  The conversation then abruptly shifted to a scathing review of Joe Piscopo’s new Showtime special, "Club Piscopo."  Numerous clips were played, highlighting Piscopo's poor impressions, subpar musical performances (flute, saxophone, and an original song dedicated to his fiancée, his former babysitter), and overall awkwardness. The hosts relentlessly mocked Piscopo's perceived lack of talent and self-awareness,  detailing the background of his relationship with his fiancée, including previous appearances on Howard Stern's show and allegations of domestic abuse and restraining orders.  The small audience at the taping was also noted.  This critique of Piscopo's special continued throughout the broadcast, interspersed with other topics.

Jim Florentine joined the show in studio. The  critique of Piscopo's special continued, focusing on his rapping, impressions (including David Letterman and Arnold Schwarzenegger), and audience interactions.  Further topics included a Patrice O'Neal benefit show (with Bill Burr scheduled to call in later), Florentine’s upcoming appearances, an update on "Stalker Patty,"  a discussion about the changing nature of football, and a brief discussion about Atlantic City.

The show continued its dissection of Piscopo's special, specifically targeting the editing and awkward cutaways. Bill Burr called in to discuss the Patrice O'Neal benefit show, providing details about the date, venue, and participating comedians. The conversation touched upon O'Neal's career and the lack of mainstream tributes after his death.  The discussion then circled back to Piscopo's special, followed by a conversation about the hosts' and Florentine’s personal memorabilia, including Florentine's extensive rock and roll photography collection and his plans for a gallery show.  Florentine also promoted his upcoming stand-up gigs.

A segment featured discussions about gifts sent to the show: meatballs, oversized strawberries, and a box of chocolate-covered wisdom teeth.  The hosts reacted humorously to the gifts.  An Irish listener was thanked for their feedback.  Florentine then shared a disturbing childhood experience involving a wrestling photographer who molested him, using photos as visual aids. The conversation broadened to discuss child molestation in general, including anecdotes from Ralphie May.  Black Friday shopping, the commercialization of holidays, and the absurdity of adult gift-giving were also discussed, including a debate on the necessity of gifts for adults.  A long, sexually charged conversation with Patty, a regular listener, ensued, focusing on her health issues, her 57-and-a-half-year-old virginity, and the hosts' sexually suggestive comments about her body and her lack of sexual experience.  Patty eventually showed her vagina on-camera.  The segment concluded with a discussion about a workplace issue Patty had at Starbucks involving getting her own coffee.

A later segment featured Patty discussing her healthcare struggles, including receiving a significant discount at a hospital due to low income but still facing substantial bills. The conversation shifted to her alleged childhood abuse and inappropriate behavior from her foster father, including incidents of him entering her while she bathed and sleeping in close proximity.  Patty sang a darkly humorous karaoke rendition of "Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer," incorporating lyrics about her childhood and her mother abandoning her. The segment concluded with promotional announcements for upcoming comedy shows and appearances, including the Patrice O'Neal benefit show, and continued discussion about Patty's experiences.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  I guess the big question, did anyone win the Powerball?  Yeah.  Anybody?  I did.  You almost forgot?  You almost forgot?  I forgot to tell you guys.  Yeah. Oh, look out.  Oh, if I won, I wouldn't be here today.  You know.  I'd be there, but my dick would be out. 
[00:00:30]  I'd have my cock out in the hallway.  How many times did you hear that on the news?  You'll know if I won the Powerball.  Not showing up to work tomorrow.  Oh, boy, you'll know. You'll know.  Douchey.  I know, right?  I think it was Arizona and Missouri, I believe, right?  Missouri.  Missouri and the Arizona there.  Yeah, they got a couple of winners.  Two winners?  The big one, I think, was it two or three?  Two or three?  Now we're cutting into the fucking profits. 
[00:01:00]  Well, you've got to murder the other people.  That's pretty much what you've got to do.  Is that how it goes down?  Yeah, if you find out that there's three, you've got to hunt them down, murder them, steal their ticket, and destroy it.  Wouldn't you be anonymous if you won something like that?  Anon.  Anon, Anon, Anonymous?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, definitely.  Anon, Anon, Anonymous?  But, uh...  Why would you come forward so now you've got...  Two winners.  Oh, two winners, Arizona and Missouri, right?  Two winners.  So that's 275 million each. 
[00:01:30]  By the way, I did have one number, and I picked the Powerball number yesterday on this very show.  If you remember, my numbers were 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, Powerball 6.  You get a free game, sir.  And, yes.  Wait a minute.  If I did birthdays, I would have...  Oh, boy.  That's my birthday, 523.  Oh, boy.  Happy...  Oh.  Then my wife's birthday number's in there.  I would have played that.  Wait a minute, man.  Oh, man.  I would have had three out of the five. 
[00:02:00]  Wow, that's like fucking...  Kind of.  20 bucks.  And then I would have absolutely picked a 29, because today's the 29th.  Right.  But would you have picked a six for the Powerball?  I would have picked 16 for Anthony, because he loves that number.  Oh, Jesus.  Huh?  Well, I like the number, but I can't pick it.  So I got it.  Yeah.  Keep it fair.  Keep it fair.  Hey, come on, judge.  Keep it fair.  Who gives a fuck? 
[00:02:30]  Everyone knows they didn't have a shot at it.  What are you doing?  It's crazy.  I bought a bunch of tickets, though.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I might have one of those $4 here or there winners, but...  Yeah, that big fucking...  That elusive big fucking jackpot win.  When you look at two people, out of all the fucking tickets that were won, only two tickets  have that winning number on it.  Do they know how many tickets were sold?  18 trillion gazillion billion.  Oh, I thought it'd be a lot more than that. 
[00:03:00]  Gillion gazillion.  Oh, wow.  Now you're talking.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Now you're talking.  Wait, I had something on that.  I had a number of people that...  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, Powerball.  Yeah.  Fuck, I had something on that.  Cray.  Cray, cray.  Indeed.  Ah, it's going to drive me nuts.  I had something.  Whatever.  Don't go nuts.  I think it might be nuts already, so...  Get some water here.  Yeah.  Ah, man.  Powerball.  Two winners.  It was a frenzy. 
[00:03:30]  Anonymous.  Eh.  Whatever.  Oh, absolute frenzy last night.  Man, that's a lot of fucking cash, though.  That's unbelievable amount of, like, do-anything cash.  Mm-hmm.  And people just have such small thoughts.  What are you going to do?  Buy a house.  Buy a car.  Buy a house.  Send my grandchildren to college.  It's like, don't you know how much money that is?  Fucking...  It's crazy. 
[00:04:00]  Buy a jet.  Crash it.  Buy another.  Well, I love the people that win 100 Gs and think they could, like, send their kids to  college, buy a house for their mom.  Nothing.  Quit their job.  Right.  No, man.  Quit my job.  First of all, the government takes their 40% easy.  Now you're down to 60,000.  Really?  You could barely pay for your college, your kid's college at that point.  Wow.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Whatever.  Powerball's over.  Powerball's.  There was something right there. 
[00:04:30]  I was going to tell you, but fuck, I can't remember.  It's too early.  That's all right.  Did you watch the tree lighting at all?  No, I watched the tweets from the tree lighting, which is good.  That's just as good these days.  Actually, it is the tweets from the tree lighting.  There's just some weird stuff going on there.  Yeah.  With the C-Lo.  What's up with the C-Lo?  C-Lo.  Is he a...  There's been speculation that he's a little...  I tweeted that he's like the black Elton John. 
[00:05:00]  Is that what he's going for?  That's pretty good.  He kind of has that look to him, right?  Yeah.  He likes them costumes.  He likes a lot of feathers.  Elton John went through his feather stage, didn't he?  Yes.  And the big glasses.  Tickly ass with a feather?  What?  Typical nasty weather.  Tickly nasty weather.  Tickly nasty weather.  It's up with the C-Lo.  I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that.  It's just...  Yeah.  He might be a little, you know... 
[00:05:30]  Did you see the three fucking opera kids?  What are they about?  I saw them the other day on one of these...  Supposedly they're huge.  Talk shows.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They're like a boy band, three tenors.  Three tenors, boy band.  Which one's the other guy?  That's like Felt.  Ah, fuck.  But...  The maestro.  But they're singing Christmas songs, and I'm thinking they don't even know English.  How they were singing them, I'm like, I don't think they know English.  Yeah.  And they're just pulling it off. 
[00:06:00]  Lashing through the snow.  No.  Is that what they were doing?  No, it was way...  No, it was like they were just, I don't know, phonetically saying it.  Like they didn't...  Oh, they didn't really know what they're saying?  They don't really know the words.  No.  That's great.  What are they called?  Il volvo?  Il volo?  Il volo?  Yeah.  Il volo?  Mulva?  Is it il?  I-L or is it L-L?  I hate that.  I-L, yeah.  Well, I hate that.  When you see...  Il volo?  When you see the two lines, you don't know if it's an I-L or an L-L. 
[00:06:30]  Really, it's true.  Right?  Yeah.  Could be two I's.  Yeah.  Capital I's.  We gotta figure that out.  Like World War O-O.  Oh, come on, fucking...  Oh, man.  This is all we got on them?  The three...  Oh, here we go.  Yeah.  Da-da-da-da-do-dee-do-ba-d.  Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock.  Jingle bell swingin', jingle bell swingin'.  There's no way that more on the pushers of fire manin'. 
[00:07:00]  Now the jingle hop has springin'.  Jingle bell, jingle bell swingin' bell someday..  Jingle bells are shinin', jingle hit the side.  And chill, let's sing, jingle epic..  ..do boys wear in this rusty air.  Now the cry time is the cry time.  The rock didn't die away.  Jingle bells, time is the sw Zahlenzeit. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, my dear, my boy, baby, I'm a singer.  Da, da, da, da.  Yeah, they're like, they do them opera things, though.  I saw them singing some opera the other day.  Oh, they're talented, but I think they don't know English or something.  Yeah, that's all they need.  But they look like boy band guys singing oldie-type music.  You think the girls love them?  Not as much as One Direction.  Well. 
[00:08:00]  One Direction's the new fucking hit boy band Heart Drops.  I know, I've got to suck it up and go down the hall  and ask for a couple fucking spots for that thing they're doing.  Really?  I've never asked for anything.  Well, I have never asked for anything.  Jesus, come on.  I've never asked for anything.  Now I've got to go suck it up and go down the hall and talk to that guy.  And try to get some...  Yeah, I want to try to take care of a couple nieces.  You know, the One Direction is big with the tweens there. 
[00:08:30]  Where's the event, you know?  It's a secret location because, you know...  Oh, my God.  There'll be mobs of girls showing up if the word gets out where it's going to be.  Word.  And I'm sure the word will get out where it's happening.  And it'll be just a zoo.  Yeah.  And I need a couple spots, so now I've got to go talk to the guy.  God.  When is it happening?  And you know how he is.  He goes, I'll do this for you, but I need this, this, and this.  There's always a catch.  There's always a fucking hook with this guy.  Hook.  I'll do this for you, but... 
[00:09:00]  Can you do 80 hours on lithium for me?  No.  I'm hoping...  I don't even know if he's going to say yes.  Which will cause a major fucking issue.  I'll tell you right now, because I don't ask for anything.  Is this one of their hit songs there, Danny?  It's their most...  Is this their hit?  Yeah.  Oh, it's All Solo Mio.  Yeah.  Eight million hits.  Wait, Rachel Maddow's in the band? 
[00:09:30]  Who's the pudgy one?  Is he like the Pavarotti?  Young Pavarotti.  He's like the Pavarotti of the three tenors.  And he's got dimples.  Young Pavarotti.  Like a Rachel Maddow.  Ah, Rachel Maddow.  That is Rachel Maddow.  There is...  He's the Latin lover. 
[00:10:00]  And there's the Rachel Maddow.  What group is this?  This is Il Volo.  Il Volo.  Il Volo.  They were at the tree lighting last night.  Oh, these are the ones that Simon Cowell discovered?  I have no idea.  They're like the three tenors, only young.  They were the go-to guys yesterday.  I guess a lot of people said no to the tree lighting ceremony, so these guys were on stage  every other song.  I guess they were like, yeah, the go-to guys, right?  Yeah.  The one looks exactly like Rachel Maddow. 
[00:10:30]  That's so fucking funny.  Rachel Maddow.  Rachel Maddow.  In the Osoromio video.  You like this shit?  No.  That's all right, though.  It doesn't bother you like the blues, does it?  No, no, no.  I'm not freaking out saying how badly it sucks, like the blues, but...  What a weird boy band that is.  It really is.  It's Rachel Maddow with, like, a big nose or something, right? 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, yeah.  It's going to make me laugh all day.  Just the stupid shit from this show.  That's great.  This is some real grease bullshit.  Yeah.  That's great.  So it was a year ago today that we lost Patrice O'Neal.  Are we sure?  Positive.  Jesus, yesterday was, like, fucking crazy. 
[00:11:30]  We kind of fucked it up a little bit yesterday, but...  Yeah, what are you going to do?  But that's okay.  He'd laugh.  Absolutely, he would laugh.  He goes, you're going to have a deal with that, motherfuckers.  I don't even know when I die, motherfuckers!  I was listening to a lot of Patrice O'Neal clips for the first time in a year.  Great.  Finally did it.  Yeah.  Wow.  Wow.  Funny motherfucker.  One of the greats.  And the benefit for Patrice is going on sale today.  Yes.  Is Bill Burr calling with the details, or do we have the details?  I don't know if he's calling. 
[00:12:00]  I know I have to tweet a link at 9.  They go on sale today at noon, and it's in February at City Center.  February 19th at New York City Center, which is West 55th Street between 6th and 7th Avenue.  We're getting a bunch of Patrice O'Neal's friends together to do it upright.  This is going to be a huge event.  Yeah, Bill Burr is calling in at 8.30 with more details.  But we ain't going to want to be at this.  But tickets are on sale today at noon.  Do I have to buy tickets?  Can I go? 
[00:12:30]  This will sell out.  I'm not even going to say I believe.  Yeah, I think it will.  This will sell out.  So if you really want in on this, make sure you're ready to buy your tickets at noon today.  It's myself, obviously.  It's Dave Attell, Bobby Kelly, Bill Burr, Colin Quinn, Keith Robinson, Voss is on it, and other guys named Ian Edwards, Will Sylvance, and Marina Franklin.  And there's a little room there if anybody else wants to come in.  But these are the people that we were friends with, Patrice, and we want to do a benefit for his family.  There were people who were asked to decline, and that's why they're not there. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, boy.  No, I'm not saying that maybe they couldn't.  People have different lives and different schedules.  I'm just telling you, we're going to get a lot of calls.  What about you?  What about you?  How about you?  Is that right?  What about you?  This is who's going to be there.  Right.  Everyone was asked that was close to Patrice.  Period.  Yeah.  That's what it comes down to.  What about those people that had the quotes in Rolling Stone?  Well, those assholes.  And they went to people that didn't even know him.  Right.  Yeah.  And blew off the quotes from his real friends. 
[00:13:30]  That's why Rolling Stone stinks.  That's the world we live in.  Fuck them running.  Like, the guys who were really close to Patrice said some really great stuff about him, and  they blew off all that stuff to get the fucking, what is it called, the bold face names?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That barely knew the guy.  Yeah.  Meow.  It's fucking disgusting.  Yep.  But this benefit's going to be amazing.  And, yeah, it's going to be great.  And the money goes to his family, obviously.  Oh, yeah.  Except for my giant fee. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, yeah.  I take a giant fee.  Do you?  No.  Jimmy takes a huge cut.  What a despicable person.  I took 60% on some backdoor deal.  Of course, it's a backdoor deal.  60% on all the liquor.  That's Jimmy's deal.  Oh, that would be terrible.  Yeah.  You know what?  Speaking of comedy, I saw a comedy special last night that was so good, I just have to  share it with everybody.  Amazing Jonathan?  It was Club Piscopo. 
[00:14:30]  See, it's Joe Piscopo, and he's on stage, and he's got a big band behind him.  Big band.  You know, the old big band thing?  Oh, big band like Sinatra.  Right.  That shit.  And in between his hilarious dead-on impersonations, he plays a bunch of instruments, very mediocre.  Oh, God, no.  And it goes from flute to saxophone to guitar.  No, no, no. 
[00:15:00]  All right, look.  This could be the worst thing I've ever seen in my life on a television screen.  What is it?  Like, where was it?  I don't know!  It says Club Piscopo.  I'm trying to...  Can you read that, Danny?  I'm way too far away from that.  Let's see.  Club Piscopo Comedy Club and Lounge opening June 30th at Resorts Casino Hotel Atlantic  City.  It?  So he's doing kind of a one-man show.  I don't know what it was. 
[00:15:30]  It was on Showtime.  It's so fucking bad.  I can't even tell you.  I was captivated by how awful it was.  Let's go get tickets.  Is he really...  Is he opening up?  He is...  I guess...  He's one of the guys.  He's done our show.  There's a group of guys that have done our show, and they bomb to the point where they  have to go, well, I was just stopping by to say hi.  Right, right, right.  You know, I was just stopping by.  They just give up on the whole fucking thing. 
[00:16:00]  Was he ever funny?  I don't think so.  Was Piscopo ever funny?  Wasn't he good on SNL, though?  SNL, it was him and Eddie Murphy kind of...  We all forget.  Everyone remembers his Sinatra bit, which was just, you know...  I think it was one time he did Sinatra, and it was kind of funny.  He did Sinatra singing like the Rolling Stones.  Right.  And it was kind of funny.  Right.  But that's it.  That's it.  We all remember Eddie Murphy being hilarious on that, and somehow... 
[00:16:30]  Look, if you go name five things Eddie Murphy did on SNL...  Oh, yeah.  Boom, boom, boom.  Name five things Piscopo did on SNL.  Try it right now.  You can't.  Sinatra.  Sinatra.  That's it.  That's all I got.  And Phil Hartman did a funny Sinatra, too.  Oh, yeah.  Phil Hartman was amazing.  Hartman's blew his away.  Phil Hartman was an amazing fucking performer.  He just put blow away.  He praised the better.  Hartman in the same...  Hartman was amazing.  But Piscopo, I can't even name five things he's done.  Can we listen to this thing?  He is like... 
[00:17:00]  Oh, what...  Is there any...  Are there any clips from Club Piscopo?  I think so.  It...  It's...  I can't tell you...  I wanted it to go longer because I couldn't get enough of how incredibly bad it was.  I can't describe how bad it is.  Let's try this.  I guess this is the big commercial for the thing.  ...Steiner, publisher of Atlantic City Weekly.  Joe Piscopo was a member of the cast of Saturday Night Live from 1980 to 1985 and starred in Wise Guys and Johnny Dangerously. 
[00:17:30]  Which he talks about in a stage show.  Right here at Resorts Casino in Atlantic City.  Nice.  Come fly with me, let's fly, we'll fly away.  If you can use some exciting moves, and here's a bar in Bombay.  Come fly with me, let's fly, we'll fly away.  He's doing an impression.  Come fly with me, let's float down too far.  He's so mediocre. 
[00:18:00]  That's kind of close to Sinatra.  No, no, no.  Is he trying to do Sinatra there?  Yes.  Oh, boy.  Yes.  His impressions.  And he was doing, like, Arnold impressions.  I mean, come on.  It's fucking 2012.  Yeah, a lot of the impressions you used to do, you don't do because they're not relevant anymore.  You throw them up as a goof.  Like, any Arnold impression now, for me, is just, ah, ah, ah. 
[00:18:30]  Right.  I'm Dix Bentley.  I'm Dix Bentley.  How long are you going to do it all day?  Oh, my God.  You're going to do it all day?  Who enjoys that?  And then he was talking about, um, he's like, my mom, my mom.  Oh, boy.  She wanted me to play the piano.  Um, and she wanted me to play music like this.  And then he gets behind the piano.  And he starts playing, like, piano.  Well, where's that clip?  That's the one we want to play today.  Oh, fuck yeah.  That was on Showtime, though.  Oh, it was a Showtime special. 
[00:19:00]  He, but he stopped going from an impersonation to act.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I'll tell you about it right now.  The last three was in rough shape.  Rough shape.  I'm in the shark bites with his teeth.  It's like scarlet pillows.  I'm going to get Dr. Vinnie Ombuds to make a house call.  Now with the fancy white pillows, Maggie gets no respect.  No respect at all.  I'm all right.  I'm okay.  No respect at all.  James Brown in the temple. 
[00:19:30]  Now, little boy.  What is see that man doing now, y'all?  Oh, this is so bad.  That's the man who's here for the wind here.  Hit me.  Follow me in the tent here.  Hit me two times.  Oh, Maggie's back in town.  Thank you all for being here tonight.  Did you have a good time tonight?  A club that's here, brother.  A smattering.  A smattering.  Smattering.  This is so fucking bad.  That doesn't sound like Sinatra. 
[00:20:00]  No.  And he knows his Dangerfield sucks because he had to go with the no respect over and over  again.  That's what an impression does to remind people who he's doing.  Just the hits.  I hate when an impression just does, like, the main lines.  Right.  Like, hey, I gotta call Dr. Vinny Boom Boss because he don't get no respect.  How many of Roddy's things are you going to mention in two seconds?  He's on the Garden State Parkway.  Oh!  I want to wake up where my nerves do not close. 
[00:20:30]  Take the turnpike past exit 13.  Yeah.  Holding my nose.  Ah, get it?  Oh, run.  I can't take this.  I'm, I'm, dude's chilling out.  This is fucking hilarious.  I'm getting goosebumps.  He actually thinks.  I make a brand new exit of it.  You know, N.J.  Oh, he's sick. 
[00:21:00]  We can't make it here.  We're gonna make it anywhere.  It's up to you.  N.J.  N.J.  We love you, silly.  We love you, New York.  But this is Currency, baby.  Hey!  That's right.  Yeah, he told them.  Oh, God.  That's great. 
[00:21:30]  And then he pulls out a saxophone.  Right.  And starts, like, playing a saxophone.  And he's serious.  And then he, like, calls up one of his other guys that has a saxophone to do a saxophone duel.  Yeah.  And then in between, he's doing these horrid impressions.  By the way, his James Brown impression is Eddie Murphy's James Brown impression from SNL.  It's not even close to that.  No, but he was trying.  He was trying to do Eddie Murphy's.  Eddie Murphy's known for that James Brown impression where you don't understand what he's saying.  Right. 
[00:22:00]  And then he does this fake, like he's, like it's off the cuff so he's laughing in the middle of his own jokes thing.  I was fixated.  You got another clip, Danny?  Please.  Please.  I can't get enough of it.  Why is it that I love bad shit like this?  I don't know.  Look at the show you're on.  It just makes us feel better about ourselves.  Wait, was he laughing at his own jokes like he's having such fun while doing it?  He's like, yeah, but you know, and then he's saying literally stuff like this. 
[00:22:30]  He's going, he's going, and then I became friends with James Brown.  And, you know, for years I never understood what he said.  And he'd start laughing.  He goes, oh, but huh, James Brown.  Yeah.  Oh, look, look, look.  I'm fucking douche chilling out.  Yuck.  It's terrible.  He'd be all right to hire for your wedding.  No.  No, just not just for the dumb singing.  He's an average wedding band singer.  It's terrible.  That's about it is what I'm saying.  That's all I would give him. 
[00:23:00]  He's talking about, you know, oh, oh, oh, here we go.  And then I hear he was rapping.  I missed the part where he was rapping.  I didn't know this was his stage show.  Atlantic City.  Watch out, Atlantic City.  Club Piscopo has arrived. 
[00:23:30]  Club Piscopo.  What is it?  They're not showing any of his impressions.  No.  That has to say a lot.  Is that Father Guido Sarducci?  Yeah.  He's part of Club Piscopo?  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  Wow.  Is this show with Joe Frazier?  I want to know this.  Father Guido Sarducci. 
[00:24:00]  Jeff Norris.  Wait, the Jeff Norris?  Wait.  Jeff Norris is part of...  Frankie Pace?  Victoria Jackson.  Oh, no.  I wonder what impression Jeff Norris is going to do.  Oh, no.  I don't know which impression he would do.  You know what?  Much like Ralphie May.  I like the white gorilla.  Much like Ralphie May, I've been shit on by Jeff Norris on Twitter.  He's shit on you.  And various things because of things that I've said. 
[00:24:30]  What have you said about him?  I don't know.  It was live from the compound.  I was drunk again.  But I did bring it up.  But...  Jeff Norris was...  Now he's going to get...  I did not know he was part of Club Piscopo.  He's part of Club Piscopo.  Jeff Norris used to do our show.  He did all right.  Oh, he was on our show a lot.  But he was one of those guys that when we moved to Satellite, he came in and it just  didn't...  I don't know.  With some relationships, it kind of goes away.  You don't know why.  I remember Jeff Norris was on the show before I was. 
[00:25:00]  I remember we did a gig in Down the Shore one time years ago.  And he was handing out WoW stickers.  Yeah.  And I think I didn't know what they were at the time.  Oh, fuck you.  Like when he had them going.  This is way back.  It was some horrible short gig we did.  Hi, dear.  Did we have that?  He would do his Archie Bunker impression.  He does a good Archie.  I remember that.  I was thinking the other day of when we jammed him all up with his story about the gun on  the dashboard of his car and how the cops stopped him.  And he couldn't... 
[00:25:30]  He said it was on the seat and he stepped on the brake.  And it flew onto the dashboard.  The story got more and more complicated.  And we assumed that he was lying.  And he got mad at us.  It was fucking hilarious.  But the details didn't...  Yeah, they didn't jive the details.  They didn't jive at all.  But he got mad at us.  He got all mad.  But it's like, come on.  Your gun can't go from the seat to the dashboard?  I do remember that.  Yeah, yeah.  It's something I haven't thought of in a long, long time.  Dude, he's part of Club Piscopo.  All right. 
[00:26:00]  Good for him.  That's a good gig.  Club Piscopo.  I mean, the people seem to be enjoying it.  I don't know.  It's not something I would enjoy.  Dude, there had to be 30...  You know he wants to come in to promote this.  There had to be 30 people in the audience, by the way.  Yeah.  It was that smattering of applause.  It was the dead people.  And Joe Piscopo has reached the point where the things he used to parody and goof on, he's doing serious now.  Like, when he sings Sinatra, it's not that goof. 
[00:26:30]  He's really thinking he's the new Sinatra in Jersey.  Right.  He really thinks he can pull it off.  Yeah.  I mean, it was average.  Yeah.  And then he gets on, like...  He plays guitar, and he plays some blues on the guitar, and he has a song about Jersey.  And then he hops on the drums and gets the saxophone, and then he pulls out a flute.  He was playing a flute seriously.  Fuck, I want the clip you were...  It's fantastic!  That's a great show.  We can't find this clip.  Showtime doesn't have it or anything.  So we've got to try to figure out how to get it to the show. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  Da, da, da, da, da.  Everyone wants us to play that Kimberly song he wrote or something.  JD from New York City.  Look up Piscopo's song, Kimberly.  Yeah.  Was that about the babysitter?  Oh, probably.  He did.  He was talking about Schwarzenegger and saying that, well, at least my babysitter was pretty.  Which, you know.  Well, he married his babysitter, I think.  Yeah.  Oh, did he?  Yeah.  The title of this video is Prepare to Cringe.  Oh, is it?  I know we broadcast to most of the audiences. 
[00:27:30]  Actually, this is an old clip.  But I was going to do something for you tonight, and I'm going to ask you to stay with me.  I wrote a song for Kimberly Driscoll, my fiancee, right?  And I got to tell you, I would never do this on, like, if it was like, you know, like a national HBO special or something like that.  So I'm going to ask that.  It's a straight song.  There's no jokes.  I know my mother likes it when I sing.  So are you with me on this?  Can we do a song for you?  Like a song for you?  Oh, no.  Hold on to your fucking seats, kids.  What is this from?  What is this from?  I think we all just made the same face.  Oh, my God.  We all looked around at each other like, this isn't real. 
[00:28:00]  He's like, no jokes or anything.  This is serious.  I need you to stay with me.  I need you to stay with me.  He knows it sucks.  When you say that shit, you know it sucks already.  Jesus Christ.  What show is this on, Dan?  I don't know.  There's no...  The shittiest show in the world.  Oh, my God.  I don't know.  There's no details.  Dude, this...  Oh, my God.  He wrote a song for his fiancée, which was his babysitter.  I think.  I think it is.  Yeah.  Okay.  That he decided to plow.  Oh, boy, dude. 
[00:28:30]  This could be really bad.  I need you to stay with me.  I need you to stay with me.  I hate when someone says, okay, if we do that, folks, it gets to clap.  Yeah, yeah.  But that's not enthusiasm.  They're just giving you the support you've asked for.  Are you saying that's not a good start, Jimmy?  I don't think it's a good start.  You've been on a few stages in your life.  Would you ever go, I need you to stay with me?  Under no circumstances.  Unless I actually do that when I'm doing an animal fucking bit.  I say, don't judge where this is going.  I actually said that to a solid thing.  So I'm talking about fucking different animals.  See, that's a little different than a song about your fiancée. 
[00:29:00]  Could you rewind so we could get the intro into the song without any...  Because I want to hear this again.  I'd rather not.  Oh, please.  This is great.  Also, the comment...  The description for the video, rather, says,  The epitome of self-indulgence, ego, and being under the unwavering influence of pussy.  Truly inspiring.  Oh, God.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Grab something.  This...  This is...  I'm so hesitant to do it, but I feel at home...  Hey, what happened?  It won't happen. 
[00:29:30]  It won't rewind.  Yeah, you saw that.  It won't even allow.  There it is.  You know, I wonder why Joe never ages.  He's in that thing the whole time.  Okay.  You know, I asked this audience.  It's mostly from New Jersey.  And again, I know we broadcast it to most of the audience.  It's actually in New York.  But I was going to do something for you tonight.  And I'm going to ask you to stay with me.  I wrote a song for Kimberly Hustle, my fiancé, right?  And I got to tell you, I would never do this on, like, if it was like, you know, like a national HBO special or something like that.  So I'm going to ask you...  It's a straight song.  There's no jokes.  I know my mother likes it when I sing. 
[00:30:00]  So are you with me on this?  Can we do a song for you?  Like a song for...  Oh, my God.  Sit to the piano.  This is...  I'm so hesitant to do it.  But I feel at home...  No, you're not.  Family and friends.  So this is...  There's a piano there, dummy.  You're not hesitant.  Stay with me, guys.  You sit on this?  Stay with me.  Here we go.  Oh, no.  Oh, God.  Jimmy's cringing already. 
[00:30:30]  This is great.  Oh, no.  There's video clips of her.  I burn inside for you  Every day  I don't know what to do  Don't know what to say  You know I need you, girl  Oh, desperately  He's trying to be bruised.  Oh, I need you  Kimberly  Oh, my God.  No.  Kimberly  Kimberly 
[00:31:00]  Kimberly  Kimberly  They say it's all wrong  We know it's all right  I love it so strong  Oh, look.  She's backstage  Looking at it lovingly.  This is a joke.  If you turn this into a joke  It'll be great.  Right?  We were meant to be  Yeah.  If you had a reveal here  It'd be great.  We're not going to get the reveal, huh? 
[00:31:30]  They're showing her in like  Fucking  Leotard  Exercise  This is great.  Kissing  There's evil forces working here  Girl  They're trying to pull us apart  Why?  Who?  Who's trying to  My love for you is clearing through  It's fake from my heart  Oh, why don't they just let us be?  Oh  You're more woman, I'm a man  Can you take my hand?  Cover me  Cover me  Cover me  Cover me 
[00:32:00]  Three, four  I can't take this  This is so douchey  This is going great  I'm on this side for you  Everything  So  It's so  That's great  I don't know what to do  I don't know what to say  We're going to make it, girl  You and me  Oh 
[00:32:30]  Did he think this is going to be a big hit?  I guess  The videos of the two of them are great  I like how he said he was hesitant to even do this  And there's a giant band playing behind him  It's all fucking arranged  And there's Kimberly  And then he brings Kimberly out 
[00:33:00]  But he was hesitant to do this  It was on a whim  Why would he bring his wife out on stage?  It's his fiance  And she's bowing  And she hands him flowers  What year is this?  If I could just have hiya, sweetheart  That was for my bride-to-be  And I know you see us on Howard Stern  Howard, we love you  And I had to ask  Where has he been on Howard lately? 
[00:33:30]  It's all right  I had to ask Kimberly  What she really  Here comes a handheld baby  I want to talk to you  It's Channel 9  Stay with me, folks  Here we go  Thank you  Oh my God  When we're on Howard  People always ask  And I wanted to do this on television  But we're on Howard Stern  And you know how I feel  Does it bother you  Does it bother you  When he's running after you  And I'm pulling you off  This is what people always ask  He's doing baby talk tour  It's all in fun  It's just a big joke  And also for the record  We did not get engaged  On the Howard Stern show  He did it very romantically  At home  And uh  Why don't you tell the folks  How I did it? 
[00:34:00]  Well  Oh my God  Dude, he's doing  But this is so  I don't know  No one gives a fuck  I'd be honored for you  To be my wife  And I'd be honored  To be your husband  And he got on with me  And he said  Will you marry me, Kimberly?  It's beautiful  Aw, that's nice  What the fuck is this?  I don't know  It's entertaining  Thank you for letting me do that  You guys are very, very gracious  We'll be right back  Thank you  Did you have a show or something?  Yeah, it's terrific  Kimberly 
[00:34:30]  He's very soulful  Why would he do that?  This is New York Primetime  Oh wait  Let's see what he says  When he's back  Oh, that was everything  Go back  Yeah  Go back and see what it is  New York Primetime  Prime  New York Prime  New York Prime  That had to be like 95  I don't know  I think it's even longer  That's before 95  Dude, I think you're talking 92  Maybe  Mullets  Early 90s 
[00:35:00]  Is he still married to that girl?  I have no idea  Probably not  Kimberly  No, no  I don't think  Probably not  I don't think they're together anymore  I would say probably not  They wanted to clear the record up  That was so hard to watch  If he had a reveal there  And then it was a goof song  Then he would have something  Can you imagine if a chick  After that big set up  A chick with a dick  Walks out  Right, right  Something like that  Sure  I meant in the romantic sense  Kimberly  You didn't think he was soulful  Oh 
[00:35:30]  It was so douchey  But if the reveal was  Yeah  A chick with a dick  Or like an animal  Yeah, yeah  Then he would have something  A fucking 8 year old  Walks out  Right  Girl, you had me  Kimberly  They're trying to break us apart  Who's trying to break you apart?  No one gives a shit  Exactly  People who like entertainment  Who would try to break them apart?  I know  He's trying to make it sound like a big  Like their love is getting through 
[00:36:00]  This big struggle  Some of these guys  Shut up  They lose touch with reality  Like he really thought  That would be a great segment  For whatever show he's on  He thought  Or his show  I don't even know  Dude  That was rough  What year was that?  I want to know  Yeah  I do remember when he was on  Stern a lot  With Kimberly  You do?  Yes  I do remember  And I kind of remember them  Goofing on that very song  By the way  Alright, so  What year?  Early 90s?  It had to be early 90s  Okay 
[00:36:30]  Definitely  So that could be 20 years old now  What we just saw  Yeah  They're divorced  What happened?  I wonder if they played that song in court  You think he sings a different version of that song now?  Oh yeah  Cuntberley  Right  Oh my god  Alright  She was his first kid's nanny  When they met  Yeah  Why would you allow your husband  To have a fucking smoking hot nanny like that?  Because you're in love  Oh god

He's maudlin  What do you mean?  He's like  He's this  Cornball  Fake sincerity  Like  Like let me just be serious  Here for a minute  You know  He was instrumental  Like he's not joking 
[00:38:00]  Yeah like who cares  Where are the jokes?  Isn't it funny  That Howard's goofing  On Joe Piscopo  With the tall blonde  Young girl  And meanwhile  What happened with Howard?  It's exactly the same thing  No kidding man  There's an article  By the way  From 2006  Yeah  And it's called  It begins  The laughter  Has definitely gone out  Of Joe Piscopo's marriage  Now that the former  Saturday Night Live star  And wife Kimberly  Are divorcing  2006 he made it to

[00:40:00]  You know the problem  With Joe Piscopo  Was he became  This bodybuilder guy  Yeah  And he forgot  That comics  Are not supposed  To be sexy  Like you can be  A good looking guy  But he got to be  Too much  He wanted to be  Seen as something else  Right  And you wanted to be  Seen as this  Handsome debonair guy  And being in shape  Is one thing  But it's like  When that becomes  Your thing  Wow your body is great  People lose interest  In your comedy  Dude he was talking 
[00:40:30]  About his bodybuilding  On Club Piscopo  Last night  And he was talking  About how  Wait is this  On Showtime  Yeah  Is this a special  Or something  Yeah it's a one off  Special  Club Piscopo  I'm watching this  Dude you got to  It's hilariously horrible  You should have  Texted me  I would have watched that  I woke up  And it was about  1 a.m.  And I woke up  And it was on  Like I missed  The beginning of it  And I saw a tweet  From somebody else  That was watching it  At the same time  And they said  Tell me you guys  And they put all of us  On the same tweet  And they said

[01:01:00]  It merits us  Discussing it  Because it's  It's the worst thing  I've ever seen  Yeah  On television  In a comedy special  Especially  It's so bad  There's no irony to it  It wasn't  It wasn't Joe Piscopo  Like  Yeah  I'm goofing around  You know  He seriously thinks  He is now the leader  Of a band  He doesn't do an impression  Of Sinatra  He thinks  He is Sinatra  Come on  They showed him 
[01:01:30]  At the beginning of the special  Pull up  In front of resorts  In an escalade  And his license plate  Says Jersey born  And he gets out  Enough with Jersey  He gets out  Exactly  Exactly  Do you think that's bad  Jim?  I've lived in Jersey  My whole life  I'm not  You know  Yeah  No  Yeah  Just whatever  This is where I live  Yeah  Yeah  He's got that Jersey pride  Well  What do you want to do here?  I mean  I know you want to listen  To the rap  He does  But  Is there other things?  Find some rapping  We're ready for the rap  Oh

We'll do the rap  Then Danny will try to find  Another part of it  That's worth playing  We'll do all the shit  In between  Yeah  Yeah  Alright  Because I don't think  We're going to be able  To leave this alone  Let me guess  He's going to be a little off  On his rap  Because he's white  It's not going to be  Yeah  It's not going to be so polished  He's going to be a little goofy  Because he's  You know  He's a white guy  So he's not really  Sure how to rap  And he's going to start  Laughing at himself  A little like that  So that's going to be the joke  I haven't seen it  I missed this part  I woke up a little late  Oh you haven't seen this  No

[01:05:00]  What if he crossed his arms  He crossed his arms  And leaned backwards  Into the side  A little bit  He's doing a rap impression  Embarrassing early  Embarrassment  Dizzle  Probably like 86  87  Right  Dude  But it shows he's  You know  With it  He thinks  He thinks  Like  You think he really  Talked to Jay-Z  At some point  Oh no  Yeah  I was gonna  Yeah  Hey Jay-Z  I haven't seen him since  But he  He tells stories  During this whole thing  About how  He was hanging out  With these people 
[01:05:30]  Like he talks about  James Brown  And he does  Eddie Murphy's bit  Of James Brown  Where it's like  You know  And he says  You know  And then you know  I became friends  With James  And  No you didn't  I bet you didn't  Why don't we  Roll it from this point  Yeah let's hear a little more  This is good  Right from here  Good stuff  Every little  Every talk  Every bit  Of like  Walking the stage  And rapping  With the crowd  Giving him an insight  Of what Joe's all about

[01:06:30]  Hosted by  Don Francisco  It's the best  It's on Univision  It's on  It's on  Every Saturday night  For like 30 hours  I know you know this show  You know  But you know what  When you're getting  Dressed to go out  You flick it through  The Spanish channel  Comes on  It's on  You come back  Who's watching this  It really is not  A great crowd  It's a terrible set up  The fucking stage  Doesn't look good  You see a bunch  Of white hairs  In the audience  And they go to  That crowd shot  The long shot  The computer 
[01:07:00]  Just shut down  The computer  Is telling us  Something right now  The computer  Just  Never done this before  It can't buffer this stuff  The showtime site  Is like  You don't want to watch this  I need to know  What he goes into  I know  Because I'm sure  It's some fucking  Spanish thing now  Because he's just  The jack of all trades  He can jump from  You know what  When you're getting  Dressed to go out  Genre to genre  The Spanish channel  Comes on  It's on  You come back  3 o'clock in the morning 
[01:07:30]  It's still on  With all the dancing  You know that show  Right  Well it's always lively  I love this show  You got any Spanish music  Oh hey  You got any Spanish music guys  I think they did that  Off the cuff  Yeah they did  Yes  I love that  Yeah man  He knows how to sell it  The answers  Turn that this way  Danny a little bit  Oh no  This whole bit  This bit  This a heck bit  Isn't it  This bit  Coca-Cola 
[01:08:00]  My particular favorite  Whisk  It's product placement  It's product placement heaven  You get sucked in  By these great announcers  It's always a product  Oh god I can't  I can't  Dunkin donuts  Holy fuck 
[01:08:30]  And the Latina models there  And they speak perfect English man  And they speak perfect Spanish  I can't speak English like these guys  This is so fucking bad  I can't  I'm douche chilling out  It's a good bit  No one can look at each other  In this room  I know  We're all just looking straight ahead  I'm enjoying this  It's so fucking bad  What  Who's there 
[01:09:00]  But  He's making a good point  Yeah  Product placement  You can only understand  An English word  Every once in a while  What's wrong with that  It's a good observation  Yeah you're right  You're right  It's fantastic  It's best  This reminds us  When me and Jim  First started doing comedy  You know  Maybe like 92, 93  Every headliner  We were always the openers  Always had a rap bit  It was a white guy  And he did a goofy rap bit  And sometimes there'd be two guys  On the show before us  And they would fight over  No I do  I close with my rap bit  Oh no  And it was basically the same thing  As to run DMC 
[01:09:30]  I'm a white boy  I don't know  Boo boo boo boo boo boo  Every  Every closer would do that  And then  You know  By like 94  They were like  Alright that's  Completely  Even the hacks  Knew that was hack  By 94  Right  Stop doing that  And he's  2012  He's fucking doing it  He looks uncomfortable to me  Oh god  Yes  There's certain moments he's had  Like that just look  Like there's a fake laugh  At one point  I just think he knows  Yeah his fake laugh  It's not an energetic crowd  I don't  You know  I  It's  But he knows 
[01:10:00]  He knows he was taping this  So he got a good crowd  Right  Can we play a little more of this  Oh please  It's all I want to see  Why do I  See this is the thing  I don't want to see it  But I can't stop watching  This should be the Patrice benefit  When they get there  We should just show this  Why I love fucking  Being in this shit  You can't watch this shit  Huh  Cause it makes you too uncomfortable 
[01:10:30]  No I can't  But I can't look at anyone else  In the room  When I'm watching this  There's some embarrassment factor here  Look he's an original man  I've never heard that bit before  With the fucking English words  Oh no no no  And then they say  The English word at the end  Yeah  That's some original shit right there  Great stuff  Whisk  Did they even sell it anymore  I don't even think so  He really needs to update  Some of his fucking references  If he's going to do a rap bit  Maybe update it to the mid 90s  Yeah  You know  Fuck  Alright let's hear a little more  Instead of Coca-Cola 
[01:11:00]  You should say Crystal Pepsi  Yes  Make it seem like you're hip  How'd you do that  Oh man  You know who I love on TV now  More than ever  Who  Who  Late night himself  Who  David  Oh  David Letterman  He turns around  He turns around  Oh yeah  Oh he's going to the piano  Is he getting some props  Yeah fake teeth I bet  Oh he's  And glasses  Here he goes

Yes  I'm really uncomfortable  Totally  This is a weird feeling for me  I'm never uncomfortable  I'm having some laughs  The flute thing was like  What the fuck?  Here he goes  So what is he doing now?  This is the type of music  His mom wanted him to play  But he just wanted to show off 
[01:19:30]  He could do this  Yes  But what does this have to do with anything?  Nothing  This is the most self-indulgent drivel  If you wanted to hear this  You would go  Go find this somewhere  Now watch  He's filling time  Now watch  He goes  That's what his mom wanted  That's what my mom wanted me to play  This is what I would play  Oh okay  Alright this should be fun  Here we go  You bring the mic over  Good thing he leaves the mic on the stand  Yeah I know  That's comfortable  Oh yeah  He's a rebel  He's a rebel  There's gonna be a joke in here though 
[01:20:00]  I know it  Yeah  No  He's just gonna play the piano  Where's the joke?  This  This is the joke  He set up the joke  Where's the joke?  Where's the punchline?  Oh believe me  He will go to a saxophone  He will go to a guitar  Don't spoil it  He will go to the drums  He  I swear to god  That's what this is  Joe Piscopo  Kind of playing some shit  Now you gotta hear him 
[01:20:30]  Wait where's the joke?  What?  Why would that be bad you play that?  Your mom wouldn't get  Holy fuck  Dude right?  Holy fuck  This is  I know  Wouldn't you play like  William Tell or something in there  Something goofy?  Wouldn't that be the bit?  Let's sing a dirty song  Something  Is what I really wanted to do  Where's the reveal?  Yeah Valby  Now look right to a saxophone  Hey if you got the saxophone 
[01:21:00]  If you got the saxophone  You gotta have the shades baby  Yeah  Oh no  He thinks he's the coolest shit  I look like Bill Clinton  Don't I?  That's a good reference  Yeah with pants on  Ha ha ha ha  I wish you looked like JFK  That was good improv guys  Come on  That was a good  Quarantine  That was a good  You know  He wasn't planning to say that  Now he's gonna play  Some extremely mediocre saxophone 
[01:21:30]  Wow  This goes on  And on  And on  What's he doing?  I don't know  What's the point?  Horrifying  I think he didn't have the time to fill it  Probably just had enough material to fill his time  No because he didn't do any material  He's just doing this  Could you imagine being in that crowd  And like being so delusional  That you think you're gonna be seeing some  Joe Piscopo comedy show 
[01:22:00]  A big Showtime special  Right  Yeah yeah yeah  Big Showtime specials being taped  And this is what you get  Yeah  But he's good at an instrument for 20 seconds  Yeah yeah  He's like those beggars in the subway  They can play one riff  They learn one riff  And they play it over and over again  So  It's absolutely the truth  Alright  Now what Joe?  Now what Joe?  I'll tell you what  What?  I love about Club Piscopo man  This is great  We're gonna turn this into a whole blues joint here 
[01:22:30]  A whole blues  I mentioned joint  The band got excited  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  Hey Florence  You're almost done  That was the worst one  That was the worst one  Dude it got a one  It got a one  Yes  A more good improv  He wasn't planning on saying that  You gotta give it to him  I bet every night you hear that  At Club Piscopo  That's what I love about Club Piscopo man  This is great  We're gonna turn this into a whole blues joint here 
[01:23:00]  A whole blues  I mentioned joint  The band got excited  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  I'll tell you what  I'll tell you what  You heard one guy go  Mike I'll tell you what  It's been a joy playing with you through the years  This guy's one of the greatest musicians  And I'd like to personally thank all the Cat Ember coming and playing with us today  But I gotta tell you  Mike let's do a little duel back and forth  Let's smoke it baby  Please do a duel with guns  You ready?  Here we go  He thinks he's a jazzy musician  Yes  Now he's gonna have a blues jazz saxophone off with the other guy 
[01:23:30]  And you can tell the other guy's like really good  Of course  And Joe stinks  He's gotta dumb it down for Joe  What is this?  Why would you want to see this?  How did you get back to sleep after seeing this?  It was very difficult  I know  I felt like I was witness to some disaster  Which I was  It's Joe Piscopo  Playing a saxophone  Atta boy  It sounds like a car horn 
[01:24:00]  There's no joke to this  His big joke was the joint line though  I killed  I wanna do a special like this  Do ya?  Yeah  Oh Jimmy  My manager's trying to get me a Showtime special  If he doesn't he's fired  After this  He's fucking gone  Oh wait wait  Wait this one right there  Thank you Michael  Oh yeah  But they didn't even jam  The sax is coming off 
[01:24:30]  They didn't even jam  No  Oh too funny  Thank you so much  Too funny  Alright it's gonna talk a little more  My favorite part in the show  Yeah  Is anything  The end  Is music oriented  Because when I sit with them  Yeah  And do anything with them  Whether it's at the piano  Okay  With the saxophone  I think that's what I absolutely enjoy the best  Nice  I was brought up in Bloomfield, New Jersey  And then we moved up Bloomfield Avenue  That's right  That's a thoroughfare right outside of Newark, New Jersey  My family came from Italy to Newark  It's Google Maps 
[01:25:00]  And we settled in Newark  And we tried to better ourselves as Americans  You know  Learn the language  Learn the laws  And you move up Bloomfield Avenue  A little lesson from Joe  It's like 1967  Oh here's his James Brown stuff  Strap in  Strap the fuck in  I remember  Leaving such an  Such an  Impact on me  You know  The riots  I think Detroit went  Philly held  Good right  But I remember  Newark went  So  I'm watching as a kid  Watching this on television  It wasn't the social activists  That kept the peace  It was certainly not the politicians 
[01:25:30]  That kept the peace  Oh Joe  You know who it was?  No  James Brown  Oh shit  James Brown  Do you remember?  James was in Boston  Doing a concert  And I remember  They broadcast that  And I'm watching that  No  James made a plea  To everybody  To settle down  Everybody stopped  Everything  Did they?  It was James Brown  That would be a part of history  Right  Something I would know  You can look that up  Right  Yeah  Fucking floor team  That would be  That would be a part of  James Brown spoke  Called for peace 
[01:26:00]  And the riots in Newark  Stopped  Because James Brown  In Boston  Called for peace  In Boston  James Brown was in Boston  Okay sure  He called for peace  Right  And the riots stopped  Yeah I'm sure that happened  I would like to hear this  This is good  Oh yeah yeah  Please  Please  Please  Guys  Good stuff  Who's the music guest for the week?  They bring in James Brown  Oh he's talking about SNL  Oh my gosh  I called my sister Carol  You know  I called my brother Rich  Because we're all like fans now  Of James man  You know  All these white guys 
[01:26:30]  Fans of this great guy  You know  And we said  Hey James is on the show  So they came down there  And I gotta tell you guys  In Studio 8H  At 30 Rock  At SNL  We know where it is  No one brought that studio  Like James Brown  Not U2  Not the Rolling Stones  It was James  Smoked it  Just blew it out  Now when the music guest comes in  You can't really get to hang with them  Could you pause for one second  I want to point something out though  Hey Jimmy  I can't take this  I'm gonna say  In 23 years of stand up  It's not bad  What I'm gonna say  This is the most  Uninteresting banter 
[01:27:00]  I've ever heard  Yes  What he's setting up his bit  It's pure  Filler  But he said  When we moved to Newark  We had to learn the language  Now he's probably  What like 60  65  So he  In 19  What  45  He needed to learn the language  Learn the language  I mean  Maybe he needs to Newark  He had to learn what  Fucking  Corny white motherfucker  This is what you do 
[01:27:30]  Here's a good cut  In this  Hey  You know what was great  Back in the 60s  When I was a kid  James Brown  I was influenced by him  I love James Brown  Here he is  Boom  Go right into this  Yeah you don't think  You should leave it up  With well you know  Our mailbox  Technically the emailing address  Yeah it was actually  Then we moved up  To Bloomfield  We moved up  That's what people did  I called my brother  Bob and my sister  Stay  Hey we got it  Yeah yeah  It's way too much  Exposition  There's a big cut right there  He's trying to do this 
[01:28:00]  Old school  Like how Sinatra  Would get out there  And talk  In between his songs  He thinks this is  Interesting banter  But the thing is  You feel the vibe  Of the room  Is uninterested  No vibe  It feels like  It's vibeless  It's not like  He doesn't have them  Eating out of the palm  Of his hand  Oh god  I'm not close  Well you know  We might get the big payoff  Let's see  Let's see  All right  Maybe  We might  The guest host  Who's with you all week long  So I'm watching this 
[01:28:30]  James Brown performance  Right  Don't get to meet him yet  We go to commercial  I'm like right here  James is on stage  And I see him walk  With his entourage  Back to his dressing room  And I stalk him  I go follow him  With my brother  And my sister  We go back  The door is shut  By the time I get to  Music guest  James Brown  The door is closed  Knock on him  He opens up  The door is closed  And there is the man himself  James  And he had his hair  All glistening with sweat  He had the cape on  He had the cape  He paints a picture  Spandex and everything man  Joe Piscopo's restaurant 
[01:29:00]  Mr. Brown  I'm Joe Piscopo  I'm a new cast member  On Saturday Night Live  What a thrill to meet you man  And James Brown said to me  He looked me right in the eye  He said  It's Eddie Murphy's bit  By the way  From SNL  He's just staring off  Nice to meet you too James  Do you know my dear friends  I am proud to stand before you  I went on to become a friend  I went on to become a friend  Of James Brown 
[01:29:30]  Wait he was in the 60s  He was saying about the riots  In the 60s  And now he's at  SNL wasn't on in the 60s  No he's only in the 80s now  When he finally met him  Oh when he finally met him  Years later  So many years later  Okay so he went from  He saved the riots  He stopped the riots  To later at SNL  To later at SNL  And now they're friends  And he says  He goes on  To become friends  I would bet a lot of money  He never saw him again  Abso-fucking-lutely  I would bet a lot  Absolutely  He went on to be friends with him  I think he's going to say  There was actually two states  That I drove his corpse through 
[01:30:00]  Commissioned me to fucking  Lug his torso  His body  You've got to go back a little  So you can get the part  Where he talks about  How he became friends  There it is  Nice to meet you too James  I'll lick his lap  Do you know my dear friends  I am proud to stand before  To tell you  I went on to become a friend  Of the great James Brown  Not once did I ever understand  One word he ever said  It's a true story  He was the best  True story  Danny Ackroyd  I'll tell you the same thing  Danny Ackroyd  Danny  My good friend 
[01:30:30]  I was going to say the same thing  James  That's great  That's amazing  I had no idea  But we were buddies man  So God rest his soul  Look at the distance there  From the band  Anyone else notice that?  Improv  Oh  He's talking about improv  All right  And I went to the  Improvisation of New York  That's tough man  When I first went to the club  That's tough man  I remember Larry David was there  And Seinfeld was coming up  He's a name dropping motherfucker  Come in  And Rodney was there  Rodney was there 
[01:31:00]  Hey Joe  How are you?  How are you?  Good to see you  Good to see you  It was Rodney man  It was great  How much did you miss Rodney David?  How great was Rodney David?  All right  All right  Hold on again  I wrote my first joke  At a comedy club in New York City  Look at the improv  He's fucking wincing  50 bucks  I'll never forget  My first joke to Rodney  I had Rodney say  Hey I got a foster child overseas  I sent him my picture  Now he sends me $10 a month  That's a cute joke  For a kid right?  Little kid  Arnold Schwarzenegger  Check it out  I'm on the cover of  Muscle Fitness Magazine  Oh yeah  All jacked up  Did he do it? 
[01:31:30]  They tell me  You didn't be on the cover  of Muscle Fitness Magazine  I can't take this  Muscle Fitness Magazine  My ego was  Wow this is great  You know sure  I could do that  It was under the career title  Of what was I thinking  So I said  But what the hell  No because he's not thinking  Didn't get a laugh  Nothing  Where were they going to shoot  The cover of Muscle Fitness Magazine  He's getting nothing  Can you pause this really quick  Because he really seems  Very uncomfortable to me  And this seems like  You know  His  Does his mannerisms  And his laughs  And he's going  No no yes  It seems like a guy 
[01:32:00]  Who knows he's having  A bad set  Yeah  Really?  Absolutely  And he's getting taped  And he knows this is special  Really?  Is that what you guys see in this?  It feels like he knows  He's having a bad set  And he's doing these weird  Filler desperate things  It just feels like  He's not comfortable  Because even his line  When he said  Under the title  What was he thinking  He thought that was  Going to get a big laugh  It didn't  So he just moved on  Real quick  Just covered that up  Like that wasn't  Supposed to be a joke  I hear you  But all you guys  Have bad sets  With good material  He doesn't have  The good material 
[01:32:30]  He doesn't have  Any material  That's what it is  I understand  He thinks he's having  A bad set  But the fact is  It's a shitty show  Oh god  But he probably thought  The SNL stories  Would be like enthralling  Oh god  Nobody really cares  Enough has been written  About SNL  We don't really care  He's banking on  People remembering him  From SNL  And like that  Just the fact that  He's up on stage  That can carry him  With nothing  And I think  You know  They probably gave away  A lot of tickets  Of people  You know  Oh Joe Pisco  Is filming a  Showtime special 
[01:33:00]  So it's people  That never seen  This act before  You know  I've seen him  In the last like  20 years  We'll go  We'll go to  You know  We're in Atlantic City  We'll go  And then they walk in  Like what is this  And he's never felt  This before  And he's like  He wanted to pack the room  I want to pack the room  With explosives  I honestly was thinking  That before  When he was playing  The sax  I didn't say it  But I've never wanted  To see a guy run on  And just yell  Allah Akbar  That's so bad in my life  How funny would that be  That's how a special end  Of a suicide bombing  Oh hoot  It feels like the room 
[01:33:30]  Is Jim's right  Papered  It feels like there's  A lot of papered people there  Yeah  And when you're doing  A Vegas room  This is how it feels  Like you're struggling  To connect  To own the room  It doesn't feel like he is  That was a mistake  On Showtime's part  They should never  Have filmed this shit  In a casino  No I agree  When you know  You're not going to get  Your actual fans  But he's not doing  But maybe he doesn't  Even have fans  The thing is  He's not doing a special  For Showtime  And like he didn't  Put this together  For Showtime  This is what he does  At resorts  He's got a show there  Gotcha  Yeah  He's under contract  So he feels comfortable 
[01:34:00]  In the resort  Places  I mean  Alright let's  Well this is where  He does a lot of  Impressions in a row  So the day  Rodney was good  Terrific  Boy  Terrific  Great  Do you think  Rodney really  Went into the improv  And said  Hey Joe  Good to see you  Good to see you  How did he know him  It was his first time  On stage  How did he know him  How did Rodney know him  Hey Joe  It's good to see you  He's trying to  Actually logically  Think this out  How this  How this stuff worked  Leave Joe alone  Go on 
[01:34:30]  Just say Rodney was there  Right  Right  Rodney was there  You know it was  A great uncomfortable moment  When he met James Brown  And he goes  And he looked at me  He looked me straight in the eye  He backtracks  And said look me straight in the eye  That's a timing thing  That's like  He looked me straight in the eye  And said  That's the wind up  For the punch  Here it comes  But he started to throw the punch  For us  He looked me  Wait  He looked me straight in the eye  Oh  This is so bad  Can you see what I was like 
[01:35:00]  I couldn't  We're still watching this  I know  We're two hours in  Dude I know  And that's what it was last night  When this came on  We're still watching this  I was captivated  We have a lot to do today  But fuck it  I gotta hear the Arnold impression  Oh it's fucking great  That was like the beef monsters  You know those beef monsters  You know those big guys  Walk around  Say things like  Hi I just bench pressed Rhode Island  Hi  Of course there was the guys  Not one left  I missed that joke  Sorry  But I didn't mean 
[01:35:30]  Start the whole thing over  Listen for the one guy  At the Rhode Island line  At Arnold Schwarzenegger's gym  In Venice, California  That was like the beef monsters  You know those beef monsters  You know those big guys  Walk around  Say things like  Hi I just bench pressed Rhode Island  Hi  Of course there was the guys  With little peepees  So that's a whole  That's another story  Different show  You go to the gym  You see this guy  With his massive back  He turns around  It's like 
[01:36:00]  Oh Bruno  What is that  Alright buddy  Couple reps with that  Then I'll be impressed  I'll tell ya  So you know  We go to Schwarzenegger  I got a tank top on  And I don't want to take it off  Because these guys  Are like beef monsters  I look like Pee Wee Herman  Compared to these freaking guys  We get it  We get it Joe  So this goes on for an hour  The photographer's name  He's uncomfortable  He goes  Joe take your shirt off  I go it's Arnold's gym man  Give me a break  I can't take my shirt off  He goes back and forth  Take your shirt off Joe  We want to take a picture of you  With your shirt off  I go alright  Respect for Schwarzenegger  I'll take my shirt off  You take that shot real quick  I'm putting it right back on  So I take my tank top off 
[01:36:30]  I suck in my gut  I do this ridiculous pose  At that very second  Arnold Schwarzenegger himself  Walks in  Here it comes  One look at me and says  Joe put your shirt back on  You're embarrassing me  And who's got the last laugh now  Ladies and gentlemen  I can tell you who doesn't  He's my babysitter  I think Arnold still does  Am I lying  He thinks he does a good Arnold  I think Arnold still has the last laugh  I think you're right  Yeah 
[01:37:00]  Yes  Because  He's delusional  He thinks he does good impressions  I mean anybody could do an Arnold  Like the Arnold is like  Yeah yeah yeah  And that  And that was  That was Arnold  That should be  He should be able to do that one  Great  This is fucking horrendous  Joe  Joe  Put your shirt back on  Oh my god Arnold's here  You're embarrassing yourself  Everything he expects to get a big laugh  Does it  Like the little lines in between  His little peppering  Yes  The peppering lines  Peppering  You know like you're peppering the crowd 
[01:37:30]  With little  You're telling a story  Little jab  You're peppering them with laughs  To keep the story going  Gotcha  Gotcha  But what's happened is  All of his peppering lines are bombing  So poor Joe  This is so bad  You just feel sorry for him after a while  Poor fucking Joe  But this is not a guy having a bad set  He can't even do an impression  Do you think Arnold walked right in  Right at that second  Right at that second  He took his shirt off  He took his shirt off  He did the pose  And Arnold walked in  And there he is 
[01:38:00]  And he comes up and he says  Here it is  No but then he goes  Arnold Schwarzenegger himself walks in  Himself  Those little words  Yes yes  Just making this so not organic  Oh  And he thought he'd tell some charming stories  And just pepper little jokes  Pepper  He's peppering the audience  He's peppering jokes  He's just bringing them along  With a little humor  All those little pepper jokes  Are dying  The Pee Wee Herman  I look like Pee Wee Herman  Yeah that was supposed to get it  That was supposed to get it 
[01:38:30]  A laugh  The little penis  The little pee pee  Yeah  Pee pee  That's another  You thought pee pee would sound funny  Yeah  They got the big back  They turn around  Whoa  We'll do a couple reps with that  That'll be impressed  Bruno's a good name  Silence  How do you do reps with your penis  I don't know  Well that's what he said  Would that make it grow  And he picked the name Bruno  He thought that would be a funny name  For like a muscle head  A little pepper  Juice head  A little pepper  The thing is  He's just peppering along Jimmy  The jokes that he's peppering in  To try to  Because he wants to tell real stories 
[01:39:00]  But he figures that what he'll do  To keep people laughing  Yeah  Is he'll pepper it with jokes  And um  How are they going over Jim  Every one of his little pepper jokes  Is dying an ugly death  So then you just go 100 miles an hour  That's what he's doing  Exactly  Yes  You talk faster  You talk faster  Yes  Because you feel the energy gone  Yeah this bit is so long  This story  And I'm not getting any laughs  I'm going to get to the end  I got to say it  This guy might kill himself 
[01:39:30]  Someone has to say it  Do you think  Yeah  He might think it was a great special though  Oh my  I was imagining that too  Like after watching this  I'm in shock  I'm laying on the couch  Let me tell you a little story  True story  I'm laying on the couch  Too bad Rodney wasn't there  Hey Anthony  Good to see you  Hey what is it the couch  I started picturing in my head  Like what happened after this was over  And he goes backstage  Did his people go like  That was it man  Of course  He's like  God it feels so good to be out there 
[01:40:00]  Of course  Like it started making me feel bad  Of course  That whole thing of  He has to go on with his life after this  Does he do one or two  There's a part of me that thinks  He only did one show  Yeah  And this was it  And this was it  And at the back  He was saying it was magic  It was good  Yeah we should have done two shows though  Should have done two  You think  Yeah he's probably thinking  Yeah we'll nail it in one  But we'll fix it in post  He should have fixed it in post  I almost give him  They should have put a laugh track  They should have  It's the king of comedy  I almost give him a stat for that  Ah he's Rupert Pupkin  Rupert Pupkin 
[01:40:30]  Ladies and gentlemen  Rupert Pupkin  Wonderful  Rupert Pupkin  But Jim's right  He's talking 100 miles an hour  Yeah yeah yeah  He senses that the energy is not  He's not owning the room  And these little jokes are not working  The pepper  The pepper  Those are the ones that keep the story  Those are the things that hold the story together  Yeah yeah  And I'm not a fan when they do this  But why didn't Showtime  Fucking squeeze some laughs in there  A little laugh track action  I don't know  Sweeten the audience a bit  No  It's an insult 
[01:41:00]  Huh  I think it would be an insult  I think he demanded  Do not sweeten my shit  No no no  I don't think so  He probably begged them to  And they said no  Oh god  Or neither  Let's go  Let's see if he doesn't have an impression  Get a little bit more  Arnold I'm sorry  Arnold I'm sorry  And I wasn't  Thank you very much  Like Arnold's watching  We always stuck up for Arnold  How do you stick up for Arnold now  How do you think  You can't stick up for him right  Especially if you're sitting next to your wife  You can't at all  You know  I'm a live performer  But I actually enjoy making movies  And I've had the good fortune of making some fun films 
[01:41:30]  We shot Wise Guys here  Here he goes now  Talking about his movies  A hundred years ago  With Danny DeVito  A hundred years ago  Thank you Mr. Al Gavano  Johnny Dangerously  We shot some of those films  Had a ball doing those movies  With Mike Keaton  And I worked with Danny DeVito again  The great Dan  The computer doesn't want me here  His name dropping  The computer is sick of his name dropping  Dribble  Mike Keaton  The way he says that shit  Mike Keaton  Johnny Dangerously  We shot some of those films  Danny Aykroyd 
[01:42:00]  Had a ball doing those movies  With Mike Keaton  Had a ball doing them  Say Michael  You sound like an asshole  And then there was one film I did  Where Treat Williams and I played cops  That died and came back to life  Called Dead Heat  And unfortunately that's what happened to the film  It was  One of those things  All right hold it  He was expecting a huge laugh  That was an example  He was expecting though  Yes he was  For that one  Not only to get a laugh 
[01:42:30]  But that was supposed to kill  And it was still going to be a pause  Jim your face is a little red  It is  Like you are actually  I'm embarrassed  You're a pause  I am  Because he  He was expecting it  So he could just take a little pause there  Get the laugh  And he didn't  He's like  Oh  He had this weird face  Not just the laugh  Not just the laugh  That was supposed to be  One of the highlights  Of the whole show  That was  Could you go back slightly  That was a peppering joke  Yeah  That he was holding the story together  Right right  The Treat Williams thing  Like he knows where the laughs  Are supposed to be  Yes  And I feel tremendous empathy 
[01:43:00]  As a comic  Like I know what this feels like  I've had a million of these sets  Where you're not bombing  But you just had  You're struggling  And you can  Oh this is a struggle  You're struggling  But you gotta think  You tried out this material  This material sucks  I don't think this ever got  A fucking laugh  I'm sorry  I know you have a struggling set  But your material's good  You go out the next night  And it kills  I don't think this shit  Will  Would ever kill  In front of any crowd  No  I don't think so either  It's self-congratulatory 
[01:43:30]  Old school  Maudlin  Shit  It's just not  Good  Let's  Let's help him out  Let's  Let's  Let's help him out a little bit  Okay yeah  Cool  Dead heat  And unfortunately  That's what happened to the film  He's wiping his eyes  Because he's laughing so hard  That he's tearing up  So you know  I was like in Japan  And I swear to God  I had their customs  And the guy's going  Dead heat  Dead heat  You died  Come back to life  No no no  It wasn't me 
[01:44:00]  It was somebody else  Mexico  I was in Mexico  Cancun  Dead heat  It was like  Don't move me  It was so good  He's rubbing  He's like wiping his eyes  Like he's laughing so hard  He's like  Can we hear those again  Really quick  Without the laughs  Sorry  No no no  Dude  It's  I was trying something  Even the last  Punching it up  Didn't help his act  Dead heat  Dead heat  You'll die  You'll come back to life  It's amazing  It's amazing  The silence  You know  Right 
[01:44:30]  I think I laugh  I'm a live performer  But I actually  Enjoy making movies  And I've had the  Good fortune  Of making some fun films  We shot Wise Guys  Here in resorts  Like a hundred years ago  With Danny DeVito  Captain Lou Albano  Thank you  Mr. Alcobano  I don't even know  What that was  I shot some of those films  Had a ball doing  Those movies  With Mike Keaton  And I worked with  Danny DeVito again  The great Danny DeVito  And then there was  One film I did  Where Treat Williams  And I played cops  Here it comes  That died and came back  To life  Called Dead Heat  And unfortunately 
[01:45:00]  That's what happened  To the film  It was  One of those things  You want to go with  And they'll play internationally  So you know  I was like in Japan  And I swear to God  At the customs  And the guy's going  Dead heat  Dead heat  You'll die  You'll come back to life  I go no no no  No please  That wasn't me  It was somebody else  Mexico  I was in Mexico  Dead heat  It was like  It was like  A sabatoi gante  You know  Unbelievable  Some of those  Oh my god 
[01:45:30]  It's painful  Why is this  It's painful  It's painful  Can I ask the comics  In the room  Yes  You never  You never want to say  Unbelievable  After a punchline  Right  No that's a  That's a dead giveaway  That you joke  Bob  And you want to hear  A sound  And if you don't  Hear anything  You have to use  Those words  Right  Like unbelievable  It's the same  As going  That shit is crazy  Things are crazy  Black comics will say  There's some crazy shit  Going on  White comics  Unbelievable 
[01:46:00]  He's doing all these  Weird things  And as a comic  You just understand  Exactly why he's  Doing them  And that's what  Makes me feel bad  For him  This was fun  Now I just feel bad  It was fun  But nah  That John  That Treat Williams  Joke bombing  And the two bombed  After it  But then the really  Bad impressions  The horrible  Letterman impression  The horrible  Dangerfield  The horrible  Arnold  And even the  James Brown  Is horrible  No it's terrible  And those are all  Kind of easy impressions  Right  Maybe not the letterman  Stock hack  Kind of shit 
[01:46:30]  Yeah  What's he talking about  Now the band  Oh sorry  Back to the band  Oh please  Oh no  I'm getting a text  From a  Atlantic City  Police officer  Oh  He can't get arrested  Just found him  In a car  In a garage  Somewhere  Closed garage  Oh this is  She was at a show  She's like a guy  At work  Held a benefit  For another cop  And his big brag  Was that Joe Piscopo  Was the headliner  And she went to the show 
[01:47:00]  This is the show  She's saying  So maybe it was  Actually this one  She bought a ticket  And she stopped in  While working  And said  How come people  Aren't laughing  And someone in the crowd  Asked me to lock up  Piscopo  From personality  I do know  A little bit about Joe  He does a lot  Of charity shit  He's a nice  He's a nice guy  I'm sorry Joe  See this  This act works better 
[01:47:30]  In Club Piscopo  In Atlantic City  With a bunch  You know  Old people down there  Gambling  And go  Go see Joe Piscopo  I remember him  From  I know  But it should have  Just been in the club  Like this shouldn't  Have been televised  It's better  It's better for him  To just work it out  In his club  In Atlantic City  And make it  But I think  Showtime got lazy  They should have  Put some laughs in there  Or taped a couple of shows  You don't put it on  Showtime  Where I will wake up  And watch it  And bring it to a radio show  And dissect it  This is like  That clip on YouTube 
[01:48:00]  Where you watch  The Big Bang Theory  Without the laugh track  But if you put  The laugh track in  You just assume  It's a lot funnier  You know what I mean  They could have  Helped him out a little bit  Is what I'm saying  Or they should have  Just  Yeah they should have  Shot it again  Even though I know  It's a lot in production  And all that stuff  They should have  Done something where  We're done two shows  I'm hoping this isn't  Two shows twice together  I'm putting my money  On saying it's one show  I think so  Are we done?  Are we done?  Let it roll a little  Are we done?  I got it  I got it  We're not done  Ten more minutes  Of this video  How many?

[01:55:00]  I've been working on the railroad  All the live long days  It's  You'd think it was Johnny Cash  I've been working on the railroad  Just to pass the time away  Almost  Oh and he's laughing  He's fighting laughs  I'll give him an almost on this one  It's very hard to  Rise up so early in the morning  A homeless guy who killed himself  In San Francisco  Did a bunch better Johnny Cash  Yes  I wish they had something in common 
[01:55:30]  Cause the train's gonna hit ya  Just so I can watch ya die  He's laughing  That was supposed to be a laugh  Oh boy  But it wasn't a big laugh  There was nothing  Only home on the range  Where the deer  He can hardly contain the laughter  To be able to sing  Where seldom is hurt  He's trying to just sell it  Yes  And his shadow on the back wall  Is horrendous  I know  I'm cheers  For killing your mama's boyfriend  Just so you can watch him die 
[01:56:00]  One more  One more  He's yelling one more  To everybody  A hundred bottles of beer  On the wall  A hundred bottles of beer  You take one down  And pass it around  I was never good at math  Cause my daddy passed away  When I was a young boy  So I killed my teacher  Just  So I could watch  Oh my god  He pointed at the audience  To make them say it  And one guy  One guy said it  One guy  Halfway said it  Probably his brother  And I sing public domain  Oh and then he's got it  Reiterate what the bit was 
[01:56:30]  You guys are great  You guys are great  No they're not  You guys are great  You know they're not  He hates them  No you guys are great  He hates them  Uh oh  Working stiff  Are we almost done?  You know what I think  Above all else  They know I'm gonna work for them  Here he goes  I'm just always grateful  To work  I'm a working entertainer  That's all I've ever wanted to do  And always grateful  To Lorne Michaels  And that whole legacy  Lorne Michaels  Always grateful  Once you're on that show  You can always work  And that's all I've ever wanted to do  Man  Just be the working stiff 
[01:57:00]  That I am right now  I ain't no star  I ain't no movie star  I ain't no star  He's just a record like that  I love it  Every second of it  Thank you so much for being here  We love you  And we appreciate it very much  Wait that was the end?  Thank you so much  Did you see what they did?  They cut away  And they cut to them  Already standing  So the producer  So there was a producer  That had everybody stand up  To make it look like  He was getting a standing ovation  Yes  The production value  Of this thing is horrendous  Or Joe went out  Or just milked it 
[01:57:30]  But what was the closing bit?  I like being a working stiff  I'm just a working stiff  Just a rig  I ain't no star  I'll tell you who was terrible  The editing was terrible  Horrible  There's still some time  Maybe he gets  Maybe as he's wrapping up  There's like some big clothes  Alright let's see  He does a drum  I'm assuming  He plays the drums  But that was like a smash cut  Of the audience standing  What terrible editing  Terrible  Terrible  Now he plays the drums 
[01:58:00]  Over the credits  He's going to look  In the drums  This is his big closer  Is the band  Who edited this?  Make sure they never work  On any of your projects  There he goes  He's lighting up those drums  Alright over this  I want to say that  Jim Florentine's going to be  At the  Brenda Carlson  She's actually a great editor  Really? 
[01:58:30]  I know  She did my special  She's brilliant  She edited your special?  Brenda  Brenda  Brenda  Is fucking  Amazing  I swear to you  She couldn't even save this  She is a fucking artist  Wow  And it says a lot  She didn't know what the fuck  Wow  She did her best  I watched her work  Like  I couldn't believe  How fucking good she was  Holy shit  I bet you  I know  These are the same guys  That did my special  Oh my god  I bet you that this is them  Why don't you get  Why don't you get a hold of one  And ask 
[01:59:00]  What was the thought  Behind this  Jimmy  Well  I bet you  I bet you he was demanding  I bet you he want  You know  Demanded some shit  Not enough pepper  To cut out  Can we go to the  Oh  Oh  What  I want to go to the very beginning  Just for a sec  We don't have to watch it  I want to see if it's the same guys  That did my special  Because  Honestly  They're actually really good  Yeah  And when I was making fun of the editing 
[01:59:30]  It's like  She's great  So if she couldn't fix this  Well there weren't a lot of edits  There weren't a lot of edits  Well when they  When they went back to him  Talking about this  Yeah  A little bit  It was a little weird  I think  You know  His closing bit  Obviously  Probably didn't go over  Bit  So  They probably  They cut to him  Being you know  The working stiff  Right  And then cut back  Good night  And everybody's standing  Because the  Audience coordinator said  Get up  You know whatever  So everybody stood up  He's closing the show  With a drum solo 
[02:00:00]  Well the Johnny Cash was to be  Well he should have really  He really should have  Closed with the Jersey song  Oh yeah  Because he's from Jersey  No I mean seriously  That would have been  Okay  That would have been okay  That would have been okay  Because he's from Jersey  And he's a silly song  About Jersey  Like that should have been  The ending bit  Good night  Instead of the Johnny Cash thing  What's he doing now Danny  Can I see it  He's just playing the drums  He's just showing off  That he's  He says thank you  Kind of good  At a bunch of instruments  Yeah that's pretty much it  That might not be  You guys  Oh  Thank you so much

[02:01:30]  And Burr will have  All the details  In a few minutes here  The O.P.D. Anthony Channel  What's that?  On Sirius XM  I hate how much fun  Black people can have  Racially man  It's just  I can say anything  I goddamn want  Racially  And white people  Have to sit there  Take it  I am evil  He's like  Come on man  I don't even say it  Because of that  I love  I love a little racial  Look man  You know  Let's be fair  I mean  Honestly be nicer 
[02:02:00]  With the racial game  I mean  I like to talk to  You know  White people about  Being honest about  Obama  You gave it a shot  You did  You gave it a  Two year shot  Like oh yeah  I tried  I tried to  We tried to  But you  It's not  It's just  It fell apart  It really  It really did  And I'm going to tell you  Something you don't know  About black folks  We would be on your side  In talking to white people 
[02:02:30]  We would be on your side  A lot more  If you would  You know  Just not ever talk  About how you feel  About anything  Racial  We'll catch up to you  Now serious  Because black people  On the edge  Are going  What the fuck  Is Obama doing  But it's too many  White people  Outwardly hating him  So we can't  We go  If you shut the  You shut up  I'll be against him  Like stop  I'm having rallies 
[02:03:00]  And all kinds  Of stuff  I'm telling you  I'm this close  To  I'm mad at him  Because I thought  I would have a white  Slave button  I thought  I thought it was  Vengeance day  I'm going to have me  A white family  Big old fat white girl  Going to warm my bed up  Get upstairs Susan  Warm my bed up  Feed my baby  With your giant white titties  And I'm going to go outside  And stare your husband 
[02:03:30]  In the face  And decide whether  I'm going to sell him or not  And you know  Your wife's upstairs  Warming up my bed  You know that right  Phillip  That's uncomfortable  Ain't it  That's uncomfortable  That's uncomfortable  I apologize  That's uncomfortable  Can't we move on  We'll move on  We'll move on  To something  They don't even like that  In play  That's uncomfortable  Right  To think about that 
[02:04:00]  But  What are you going to do  Serious X  It's the OPN  Beauty Show  Alright man  Yeah  Bill Burr's calling  Any second  That was the great  Patrice O'Neal  We lost him a year ago  Today  One of the greats 
[02:04:30]  Of all time  Most would agree  Yeah  People that understand comedy  Know how great Patrice was  Yeah  But you know  He didn't have the  Mainstream success  That he would have gotten  Because you know  This elephant in the room  How is he not  To show you what garbage  The business is  Elephant in the room  Is so smart  And so funny  And how does that not get  The critical recognition  It should have  It's amazing  It's just  The business stinks dude  And he knew it stunk  And he said it 
[02:05:00]  And he told people  Who are part of the business  You stink  He told the people  Making the decisions  You stink  Right  Yeah  It's a tough one to do  And it hurt him  I mean  Patrice would tell you that  It hurt him  With opportunities and stuff  Because  He was the one guy  Of all comics  That they couldn't hide from  Like when  When he was there  Look I pussy out  When those guys were around  I mean I try to be nice to them  Because I want them to like me  He honestly  Didn't give a fuck  Didn't give a fuck 
[02:05:30]  Right  Or he cared  But for him being honest  Was more important  He started caring a little bit  At the end of his life  At the end he did yeah  You could tell  There was a change going on with him  You know  But I mean  Look we just played two hours  Of the Joe Piscopo thing  Of course they stink  They'd rather fucking do  A Joe Piscopo special  Than a Patrice O'Neal special  Yeah  Back you know  For Patrice being honest  Was more important  Like being honest  With these people  And telling them  That you're awful  Was more important  Than them approving of him 
[02:06:00]  In the moment  And he was willing  To blow opportunities  For that  Right  Because he really had  Integrity man  It's like even though  He made decisions  That he probably would  Look back on and go  I shouldn't have done that  It was always  For integrity's sake  And he even did it like  You know  Someone  Whatever show he worked on  Like an MTV  Half hour comedy hour  Or something like that  He burned the bridge there  He yelled at a producer  He argued with him  That guy in three years  Is going to be  The head of Comedy Central  He's going to be  The head of NBC  And Patrice has got  You know  Maybe a development deal  With NBC  And they want to go  Meet with him 
[02:06:30]  And they go  No I don't like that guy  No come bring him in  And it just happens  Just like that  All those guys move up  And then you're like  Shit now that guy's there  He fucking hates me  Well they're not  Going to be able  To stop it  I mean I think  I think Patrice is  You know  He's just going to grow  From this point on  The legend will grow  You know  Oh definitely  It's only been a year  But he's not even  Close to forgotten  No  Not even close  But no tributes  To him on comedy networks  On any of them  Or on any of them  And it just  It's really frustrating 
[02:07:00]  It's almost like  Now that he's dead  And he can't yell at them  They're just going to  They're not going to  Pay him the proper  Yeah  Tribute  Which is  It's disgusting  And it's sickening  Whatever  He's going to  Fucking grow  You know  No matter what  And with that  We say hi to Bill Burr  Bill  Hey  Hey what's up guys  Hey Bill  What's going on buddy  What's up Bill  Hey  I'm half asleep  Five something  In the morning  Out here  Yeah  That stupid LA time thing 
[02:07:30]  But you got a  You got a big announcement  I mean  We all started tweeting  About it  You know  Yesterday  And we're all  Excited man  The Patrice O'Neill  Benefit is going down  Tuesday February 19th  Here in New York City  Right  That's right  It's finally happening  And tickets go on sale  Today  At 12 noon  We're all going to  We're all going to  Tweet out the link  Here in about  15 minutes  And for those  Old school people  Like me  Who hate computers  You can also  Call for tickets

[02:08:30]  I didn't realize that  It's like 55th  Between 6th and 7th  I thought that was  In Queens or something  I'm an idiot  Yeah  I'm glad I called up  Because I don't know  What you were going to  I know  I would have missed the show  I'd be in fucking Queens  And Bill  Bill put this whole thing  Together man  Yes  He took it upon  He took it upon himself  To make sure  This is done right  Well it's really me  And Norton  And Jimmy  I'm sorry Jimmy  Of course  No no no  But what happened was  It was not getting done  And we were trying 
[02:09:00]  To get it done  And there was  There was issues  With the comedy festival  And again  They weren't being dicks  They were trying  To make it work  But it just wasn't happening  And it was very frustrating  And then Bill just goes  Dude what the fuck  And the next thing I know  He's like we got a date  We got a venue  And I'm like good  I was so happy  That you did that man  You did a fucking great job Bill  Oh thank you man  No we were sitting  They just called us up one day  Because it was supposed to be  In November  Like right around the  The anniversary  And all of a sudden  We get this call  It said yeah  It went away  It's not happening  It just went away 
[02:09:30]  What are you talking about  It went away  Exactly  What the fuck  So I went in to  I went in to  Opie and Anthony  And I was like  Jimmy what the fuck  Do they mean it went away  But our love for the guy  Went away  It didn't go away  And I was like  You want to do the show  He's like yeah  I was like I want to do the show  Fuck it  Let's get eight other guys  Who want to do the show  So we got a great lineup  So far  What do we got  Norton  Me  David Tell  Colin Quinn  Bobby Chelly  Keith Robinson  Rich Voss  All his dumb friends 
[02:10:00]  Are going to be on there  Dumb friends  Marina Franklin  Ian Edwards  And Will  Are going to be on too  It's a fucking  It's a really  It isn't honestly  It's a phenomenal lineup  And I say phenomenal a lot  But it really is an amazing lineup  And you know  And if you like Bill Burr  You should buy a ticket  Because I think he bankrolled  This whole thing  He's a little nervous  It has to be said  I'm definitely  Setting this down  I'm thinking about  Putting a pop comic on  Or something  You'll do fine Bill 
[02:10:30]  Obviously Bill's not looking  For a buck  Through this whole thing  But he definitely  Yeah you got to rent the venue  Yeah he put his ass  He put his ass on the line  Is what I'm saying here  Is that how this got done Bill  Yeah there's a lot of money  Up front  Oh yeah  Bill sweat a little bit  And I promised him personally  I said this thing will sell out  Dude I didn't know that  Fuck yeah man  Jimmy's taking 60%  We learned  Bill I could chip  Bill I could chip in 100  If you want  Yeah you guys are going to see me  At the end of the show  Walking around with a sandwich board 
[02:11:00]  Up and down Broadway  Yeah  But you know what  It has to be said  This is  You know  It says a lot  This is what you  You know  Patrice O'Neal meant to you Bill  Well  I got to tell you this though  But like  I  The guys that I called up  The people that are on the show  You know  I called up  I knew that they were going to be solid  Like  Like Bobby  When I called up Bobby Kelly  I said dude  Are you open  February 19th  And he said  He said yes  Even if I'm not 
[02:11:30]  I'll cancel whatever else I got  And that's all I needed  And I knew that  I could just sort of  Plow forward  Yeah  And you know  Nobody cares if they're advertised  You know  And that type of shit  So  So  You know  The real thing that's going to sell this though  Is going to be  How much people love Patrice  And how much they love this comedy  And  It's going to be a great night  So everyone's going to go off  And kill  We'll probably trash each other  Oh I'm sure that'll happen  Jesus Christ  Yeah  Yeah  It's going to take the night 
[02:12:00]  And  So far  That's the lineup  There is some wiggle room  I'm still reaching out  To a couple more guys  But  I'm really  Happy that this is  This is going to  Happen  Because it's long  Long  Long overdue  Because all that stuff  That Florentine and Jimmy  Were just saying  And you guys were saying  About Patrice  It's so true  And there really should have been  Something on Comedy Central  You know  Given this guy  Is due  I mean  He's really beyond 
[02:12:30]  The comic  The guy  He's the funniest guy  I ever met  So  Yeah  I think  All of us would say that  Yeah  It's disgusting  If they haven't  Tributed him  Comedy Central  Should just shut down  If you can't see that  You should have done  Something for Patrice  What are you doing  Well they should film  This as a special  Is what they should do  Yeah right  That would help Bill out  Yeah  Because everything  Everyone's busy  Over at the fucking  Piscopo show  The second that happens  Then it goes away again  Because it's going to be 
[02:13:00]  Like 9,000 people  Get involved  Yeah  And it's just like  Well what about my ego  And my dick on the table  Well how does that  Get serviced  And then it just  I don't know  I hear a little  It's kind of a fitting thing  That it just got put together  By his friends  I think Patrice would have loved it  That there was really  No  None of the industry  Was kind of involved  In this thing  So in a way  I think it's kind of fitting  Yeah  I hear a little frustration  In your voice  And Jim's voice  Well it's frustrating  That they haven't paid tribute to him 
[02:13:30]  That's what bothers me  It's like  You know  Did you guys really not see  Why  Because you think  That your audience  Skews younger  And a lot of them  Might not know Patrice  Because you know  It's like  But can you not just  For once  Look at the greatness  Of this guy  And understand  How other comedians  Some comics hated him  But you know  Nobody didn't respect him  Even comedians  That hated his guts  Wouldn't say  That he wasn't  A brilliant act  Or a brilliant guy  I mean  If you were 
[02:14:00]  You were just  Fucking lying  No one said  The guy was not  A great comic  Yeah  Right  That's a good point  Jimmy  Even 60%  Of the people  That worked  For Comedy Central  That Patrice  Probably trashed  60%  Yeah  Conservative  Yeah  I love them  Fucking stories  You know  Unfortunately  They were all  Self-destructive  But those stories  Of him  Just  Fucking himself  Over  By opening his mouth  Are hilarious 
[02:14:30]  He did it  So many times  But he  But he was  Telling the truth  Oh absolutely  Yeah yeah  But no one does that  No one fucking  Tells the truth  You bullshit  Your way into jobs  That's how you  Get the work  I'm not gonna name  The show  But he went into  One network  And his whole meeting  Was trashing the woman  For putting the show  On the air  How is that  A good thing  For your career  I love it  He just didn't  Fucking  He couldn't  Go in 
[02:15:00]  And just lie  Even if he knew  It was gonna  Be great for him  To do that  It was like  He called me up  After he did it  And I heard  The joy in his voice  Like he actually  Had a great time  Doing it  Making them squirm  Telling them  How pathetic it was  That they put  This piece of shit  On the air  Holy shit  Laughing at them  I don't understand  That literally  Probably ten comics  Had walked in  In that day  Hat in hand  Cap dancing  Trying to get  Their show 
[02:15:30]  In the air  He comes walking  In the exact opposite  Going  Why would I want  A show on this  Network  Where you put  This piece  And he would  Just be like  Be honest  You don't even  Watch this show  Laughing  Holy shit  Yeah  He would literally  Blow up a bridge  Before he stepped on it  Laughing  Laughing  Laughing  The amount of times  When Bobby Kelly  Really gets laughing  He gets like  This little short  Thing go  Like breath going 
[02:16:00]  Where he can't  He can't get  The words out  The amount of times  He called me up  He'd already be laughing  And I'd be like  What?  He'd be like  Fucking  Fucking  The truth  This whole story  I would already  Be crying  Laughing  Before it even  Started  How hard  Bobby was laughing  Oh shit  Oh that's fucking  Fantastic  Since Patrice died  The amount  The fucking  Weird times  That I miss him 
[02:16:30]  Like I remember  Right around the time  Last year  When he got sick  That really  Awkward interview  With that  Sandusky guy  With Bob Costas  Oh yeah  Yeah  Yeah  When Bob was going  So do you  Find little boys  Attractive  And the guy  Like  Like stuttering  Do I  Find them  Yeah  Like to  Sit near them  And I just  Heard Patrice's  What?  I'll get  25 minutes  On some awkward 
[02:17:00]  Pedophile interview  And the whole  He would just be  I just pictured him  At Caroline  Chilling with that  Yeah  Yeah  Those were weird times  Like I miss that guy  He always found  The unusual angles  Into this stuff too  You know  Yeah  It was never the obvious thing  And it was always brilliant  Every single fucking time  Yeah  I miss him when I have  Fucking women questions  Like literally  As much as it annoyed me  That he fucking thought  He was this sex fucking thing  This master of relationships  Yeah  But he really was  So smart with that stuff 
[02:17:30]  And there's been plenty of times  In the last year  And I've been like  Fuck I want to call that  Big dummy  And honestly ask him  What he thinks  Because there was times  Where I would ask him  And he was always  Fucking smart with that stuff  Yeah  It was always hard to go  To your friends  For real advice in life  Like it's easy to talk comedy  But it's hard to go  Look I know you really  Understand this  Better than I do  But god damn it  He understood that  The dynamics of those interactions  Better than anybody  Yeah  I met a number of women  On the road  Who said  Who are huge fans  Of Patrice  And said  If you really listen to him 
[02:18:00]  In an odd roundabout way  He was actually a feminist  And I was just like  Wow  I gotta go back  And listen to his shit  They're like  No  He's actually trying to get it  To stick up for ourselves  And stuff  I was just like  Jesus Christ  Because right from the outset  When he would start talking  About relationships  And women  And you know  What they do  And how guys react to it  And all that stuff  The second he'd say something  Your instant reaction  Is to go like  Holy shit  You're insane  You can't even like 
[02:18:30]  Say that  In front of a girl  What are you talking about  But you give it  Any thought whatsoever  And you realized  How logical  And honest  And how much sense  It really did make  Even though  You know  It sounded insane  He had that shit down  Man  He knew  Like the thought process  Of women  Really did  One of my favorite lines  That he had  Was when he would  Sucker them in  When he would go  He would just say  How much control  They had  Because of their 
[02:19:00]  Pussy  He goes to me  What would you guys do  How would you satisfy  A guy  If you didn't have a pussy  What the fuck  Would you do  And then  Someone would always say  Let him  You know  Put it in my ass  And then he would just go  Congratulations  You just reduced yourself  To a set of holes  We were talking about  How he could do that  Every night  He suckered him in  Yeah he would lead them  He could lead an audience  And yeah  Like some  Kiss ass in class  Like oh I know the answer  Yeah 
[02:19:30]  We were talking about that  How he could lead an audience  And a great example of that  Was the  The  What's her name  Hallowell  Natalie Holloway  Yeah Natalie Holloway  And he'd say  What was that girl  In Aruba  That got killed  And the whole audience  Goes Natalie Holloway  And he goes  Yeah yeah yeah  He goes  That guy  He goes  They found out  You know  That he had killed  Another girl  In Peru  What was her name  And just dead silence  And he goes  Exactly  He made the audience  Do the fucking punchline 
[02:20:00]  Of the joke  Yeah  He was the only guy  I had no problem  Cockblocking me  Like I'd be talking to chicks  After the show at Caroline's  He'd come up and say  The same thing  Look he wouldn't be talking to you  If you guys didn't have pussies  Oh right  He's like look you're hot  And you got pussies  They're like that's not true  He goes look  Do you see those three fat chicks  Over there  Is he talking to them  No he's talking to you  Because he wants to fuck your pussy  And they would walk away  And I was like  It was okay  For some reason  Anyone else  You'd punch him in the face  That was my warning  When I work with comics  I go look  There's no rules 
[02:20:30]  You can do whatever you want  On stage  I don't care if you fucking  Say the n word  Fifty times in front of me  Do not cock block me  Do not come up  After the show  And go hey  Your wife called  The kids are crying  Don't pull any of that shit  And we'll get along  For the week  But Patrice it was okay  God damn  Hey Bill it's 9 o'clock  So what's the link  So we can tweet  I just tweeted it  Oh cool  What was the link  Hang on a second  Hang on  Bill texted it to me  And are tickets on sale now  Or at noon  At noon  At noon  Okay  Dude this is going to sell out  I wanted to send the link out 
[02:21:00]  And give people  You know  Because it's  You know  I just want to give people  A three hour like  Window here  Like okay  To go on at this time  You know  I don't know  Dude I'm new to this shit  I probably promote  You did it Bill  You did a fucking great job  Yeah man  You did it  Everything was fucking  Was bogged down  And like waiting for this one  We're trying to get this comic  To respond  And the fucking nightmares  Behind the scenes  Of trying to get certain people  To say yes  So that  It would be comfortable  And whatever  People were busy  I gotta say  You would think 
[02:21:30]  It would be a no brainer  For people to say yes  Yeah people weren't available  Or whatever  For whatever reason  Then Bill just got very frustrated  And he took action  And you just  You did a great job man  Hey Bill  How many does the venue  Bill  How many does the venue hold  It's like 2200  I don't know  2200  Yeah something like that  It's going to fucking sell out  It's absolutely going to sell out  Don't you worry sir  And a lot faster  Than I think you think  Absolutely  What's the link  Yeah  We're all sitting here  Waiting to tweet  I just retweeted  Jimmy's  What the hell is it 
[02:22:00]  Hang on a second  It's hard  It's a bit  It's a URL  It's  Just grab it off mine  Just copy and paste mine  And just retweet  Or just tweet it yourself  But copy and paste it on my link  No I can just  I can just retweet you  I gotta hear  I gotta hear  The website is  www.newyorkcitycenter.org  And you'll see like a link there  On the homepage  What Jim  Jimmy and Oliver  Tweet right now  It's going to be  To the exact pace  But  You know  Whatever  Jimmy what are you on Twitter  At Jim Nord 
[02:22:30]  It's just Jim Nord  Yeah we're all retweeting it  So we got it  And it's going to be  On our Facebook page  Opie and Anthony  This thing will sell out  Tickets go on sale  At noon today  So let's go  Let's get this done  Yeah  Let's honor this guy  The way  Which it should have  Already been  It should have been done  Like eight months ago  Yeah  So we're a little behind  The curve here  So let's  You know  Let's send him off  The way this guy  Deserves to be sent off  Okay  Yeah  Yeah sold out show  With the money  Going to his family  Obviously none of the  Comedians are getting anything 
[02:23:00]  It's all for his family  So if you  If you loved Patrice  But you've seen me  In the last year  You've seen Bill  Who cares  Just come out anyway  Because you're going to  See a lot of great comics  And I'm fucking  I'm psyched to see Colin  I fucking love seeing Colin  Especially  Especially Colin  With other comics  Around and shit  There's nothing better  And it doesn't matter  If the fans have seen  You guys recently  Because I think  This type of show  You guys are going to  Throw away a lot of your material  And just fucking  Have a lot of fun  Yeah  I'll put a tiny URL together  Just in case anybody  Can't find the link 
[02:23:30]  If they just go to  TinyURL.com  Slash Patrice Benefit  Oh good job  They'll get all the information  Way to go Daniel  If I say good job  One more time  Fucking knock my teeth  Out with your elbow  Oh good job  Oh Anthony  Don't be so fresh  Nice language  Alright Bill  Why don't you go back to bed  We got it from here sir  We got it from here  Okay  Good job  Good job  Good job  Good job Bill  See you soon man  We'll talk this week  You guys are real swell  Hey Bill 
[02:24:00]  I'm thumbs up  Thank you Jimmy  I'll see you guys  In a few weeks  Alright see you later  See you soon  The great Bill  Yes  Great in so many ways  A great comic  But a true friend  A true friend  He said fuck this  I'm doing it myself  That's a little scary  Yeah he's  A little scary  He's out there  He'll be fine  I have no fucking  Doubts  I mean this is  It's a once in a lifetime  Thing  Great lineup  It's for a great cause 
[02:24:30]  And an amazing person  Yeah  This will be fantastic  A lot of fun  I can't stress  I think this is gonna sell out  Because I just checked my Twitter  People are like  I'm fucking driving from Boston  I'm driving  I mean people are gonna go  To this fucking thing  Tickets are like 75 bucks  It's a very fucking reasonable ticket  Considering the amount of comedians  You're getting  The amount of comics  You just gotta get a shirt together  And wear the  I agree  You gotta get some kind of shirt together  People will fucking buy that  Yeah because again  I get 60% of all proceeds  So I would like to  Oh right  But that's gonna interfere  With Voss selling his CDs 
[02:25:00]  In the lobby  Could you see him  I'm like  Hey there's people here  Why wouldn't I  Do it  I might even sell merch  I'd just give all the money  To his family  I think we should sell  If we sell merch  All the money obviously  Unless the union  Wants to take a piece of theirs  That could probably want  Like 30% of the shirts  Fuckers  Some kind of cool  Patrice O'Neal shirt  I totally agree  Because then  Then the people  That don't make the show  Would probably also  Purchase that  And that would  Picture Patrice on the front  And then in the comedy benefit 
[02:25:30]  Whatever on the back  With all your names  Like tour dates  Huge  Huge  Huge  All right  We're gonna break here  You got some  Patrice on the other break  I wonder if they have anything  Patrice's they could auction off  I mean like  Is there anything of his  That was personal  Dude that's racist  If there was one of his  If there was one of those hats  Yeah  That wasn't given away  To a friend or something  I think that would command  Some serious bucks  Mine's in the office  Are you kidding?  I would  It's in the hat box  As much as I appreciate  The family gave it to me  I would absolutely give it back  If they can make some money 
[02:26:00]  Off that  It's super cool  I'm having mine mounted  Put into my bar area  I'll absolutely give mine  I think that would raise  I mean that was like  It's an iconic  It's huge  Piece of Patrice  It's great  Yeah I got one of those  The one from my special  I'm gonna have that  I'm keeping that though  I'm having that  I'm having a designer  Help me with my apartment  Because I'm so fucked up over it  That's one of the things  I want to do  Is he just gonna come in  And say throw all this out  You baby  No but I had  It's funny  I had two gay men  In my house  Oh  I know go ahead  That was just  One of the gay men 
[02:26:30]  And they were helping me  Do my apartment  And they were just  You know quoting prices  And they were so funny  That I'm looking at my pictures  And you know they both  Want to spit on me  Of course  But they go  We can put your art here  Art  Like they're trying so hard  To not just go  Get rid of this shit  You fucking tacky  Ugly nothing  A kiss poster is not art  Yeah  Dude I got the fucking poster  You gave me on my wall  The Durandy sign  Yeah the Aussie one  Nice  I swapped them out  Once in a while  Yeah  Oh do you 
[02:27:00]  You take it like a gallery  My signed Kareem picture is up  My signed Shaq one is going up  Yeah  Did you take the kiss  You had the kiss one  In your bedroom though  That's still up  That's still up  It's over the bed  It's like  Dude you're fucking  Like a 13 year old boy  Dude you got Paul Stanley  Looking right at you  I have the kiss  A giant long  It's like a 15 foot  Or 12 foot long  Kiss thing  From the side of a bus  Over my bed  And in my bedroom  There's  I have lengthwise  One over the other  Framed photos  Of myself with bands  Each individual 
[02:27:30]  Like I have  There's a giant frame thing  With everyone in Motorhead  Like three pictures  Lemmy, Phil, Mickey  And me  All of them  And they're all signed  And they're all in the exact same frame  It looks great  Do you bring girls in there  That aren't paid for  And prostitutes  I mean  But they  You know  They have  But if you bring a girl  In there  That like  They don't care  Do you bring girls in there  That you've like  Dated  I have Motorhead  And then I have Kiss  And then I have my TV  And then I have  And this is 
[02:28:00]  One over the other  Like lengthwise  I have Black Sabbath  Yeah  Fucking  Metallica  Motley Crue  And Metallica  That's what my wall is  That's my fucking wall  It's kind of impressive  It's hilarious  See the thing with  The thing he's got going for him  If he ever gets married  Yeah  Right  Say he meets a chick  And like the next year  He falls in love  When he gets married  He's already grandfathered in  Those pictures are already up  They're up  So he doesn't have to  Take them down  If they got their own place together  You know  Hey let's get our own 
[02:28:30]  Come on  Then there's no way  Some chick would put up with that  My shit's in storage  I had a room  Dedicated to the radio career  All these great photos  And things that I've collected  See that's what happened  And it's now  He knows  It's now the diaper changing room  It's the baby  This is Ed's worst nightmare  I want to buy a bigger apartment  So I can fuck  I want a two bedroom  So I have more room  To put my pictures up  I got artwork  I got cool shit  But it's just fucking  I got an office down in the basement  I just put all the stuff  In my office  Just covered all over the walls 
[02:29:00]  So I just kept it in there  I have so much great shit  To hang up though  Fucking all these  Pictures  Pictures  Pictures  Dude I have all this fucking  I have a  I have a couple of  Do you remember  When I interviewed Ozzy  For the fucking thing  And you and I  Were there together  You filmed it  Yeah  I have two pictures  Of myself and Ozzy  That day  And they're both blown up  They're probably like  You know  30 by 20  And Ozzy signed  One of them  It's me and him smiling  And there's one  Where he's choking me  And it's like a set 
[02:29:30]  And it's like that belongs  On the wall  But it would take up  Such a massive piece of room  I need a bigger house  I want to cover my fucking windows  See this is why  I wanted to do something  With Jimmy  We spoke about it once  But if there was like  A Jimmy art show  And it was all his pictures  And you got to come  And see all this stuff  I think it would be awesome  It would be a hit  A gallery show  I really think it would be  A gallery show  I'm worried somebody  Would take my signed Ozzy pictures  I got security  You would get Club Soda Kenny there  Trust me  It's like a gallery show  No because there are people  Everyone's touching shit 
[02:30:00]  And poking it  No one fucking does that  When you ever see an art show  No one goes and stops  Touching everything  Jimmy would just  Walk around being the  Worst guy ever  That's his head  He thinks people are going to go  And take his pictures  Right  Maybe I could fucking have  I put copies of them  They have art shows  Where they have  Like priceless pieces of art  Exactly  I saw American Gothic  It was right in front of me  I could have touched it  But you don't  Are you worried they're going to  Take their greasy fingers  And touch all your shit  I'll be dead  I'll be dead  I'll be dead 
[02:30:30]  Get some yellow  Yeah you put some velvet rope up  So they can't touch them  Yeah there you go  That is funny  That's what museums do  You should do it before  Like the Patrice benefit  If there's a special room  Charge another 50 bucks  To get in there  There you go  And look at all your pictures  That's fucking hilarious  Look at your pictures  Nah they'll probably get broken  And then that'll be the real thing  We can make sure  They're not broken  He's got a collection  No one will ever see  I know  It's amazing  There's a whole thing  About getting a transfer  In the pictures  From his house  To the venue  We could get someone  From a museum  To take care of this  Could you imagine  The transport day 
[02:31:00]  No matter how  Careful they move  Like they move  Priceless words to art  To art shows  And if you got  The same company  That moves like  The Mona Lisa  To do it  Jimmy would still  Be freaking out  Yeah does Da Vinci  Have a picture  With Sabbath  Holy that fucking  Rock and roll  Hall of Fame  He's got a point  Signed by all of them  That's true  He's got a point  Because Bill Moore's  He's not in a band  Anymore  So that's very rare  And he's not  Even joking  No he's not  That's the beauty  When we were seriously  Thinking about this  In the back office  We were thinking 
[02:31:30]  What's going to be  The biggest challenge here  Is it going to be  Securing the space  Is it going to be  Convincing Jimmy  It's a good idea  No no  We said getting  The fucking things  To and from  Is going to be  The biggest deal  Without Jimmy  Losing his shit  But we could get  Some of those  Long bank guys  No there would still  Be a problem  No because they'd  Break it  A curator  Do you have backups  Of all your pictures  Like in case  Just say your  Apartment burns  Well on a computer  Sure  But they're not  But if it burns  In your computer  Like your computer  Will go along  With the pictures  I have a separate  All on disc  At my mom's 
[02:32:00]  I saved all my pictures  There just in case  My place burns  Off site  I have a bank vault  I have a bank vault  What?  I have a safe deposit box  That I do have  A hard drive in  With all of my writings  And my photos  It's probably been a year  Since I've updated it  So the last year's worth  I would lose  Oh man  But I'm going to do it again  Today you're going to do it  It's like Takagi's vault  In fucking Die Hard  I hope he doesn't pay for it  And it gets auctioned off  On storage boards  Just get three gigs  Of child pornography 
[02:32:30]  No it's mostly my  That was what my biggest fear  Was my pictures  Yeah  You should really put them  In a  Give them the Voss  Have a set at Voss's house  Just in case  Oh yeah  That's a good house  I have them in a bank vault  I have them in a  Fucking safe deposit box  Yeah but you might  Oh you got  Okay I thought you had them  In a vault  No I safe deposit box  Okay  Alright  Voss's house and grill  Bonnie lights that place up again  It's a bad place to store something  That's true  I forgot about that  But I want to do  I actually want to do  A one man show with them  With the pictures  Oh  That would be interesting 
[02:33:00]  That would be amazing  But some people know  The stories already  Like the kiss picture  Nah you got enough stories  The De Niro one  There's some funny ones  I would like to have  But I would have to  But people would go to that  To see the actual pictures  And you tell us  That would be  Well a one man show  I would have to do  With fucking like  With a screen behind me  With the pictures  Of course  Yeah  You know speaking of which  I brought in the wrestling picture album  With all the wrestling pictures  A guy molested me  And someone  A fan  An ONA fan  Sent in a picture of the guy  That molested me  And it was him  Whoa  I got a Polaroid shot  I got it in my bag  I forgot all about it

[02:58:30]  On a Saturday  So they dropped him off  They drove him to New York  Dropped him off  At his apartment  And he was gonna bring him  To the wrestling match  The next day  So as soon as the parents left  The guy was all over him  Trying to wrestle him  And grab him  And he's fighting him off  The whole time  And he just started crying  And the guy just said  Oh just go to sleep  And he let him alone  In the morning  He woke up  He goes  Call your parents  The wrestling match  Got cancelled  The parents had to come in  And go pick him up  Cause he wouldn't put out  He wouldn't put out  Do you think he got another kid  To go to the match with him  He probably used that for leverage  To get some more ass 
[02:59:00]  Probably  But yes  Why would you go with a kid  That you ain't gonna get  Any fucking shit off of  Oh but imagine dropping your son off  At 12 years old  At some guy's house  Of course not  At some creepy guy's house  Look he stayed over  At my house too  My father met him  Jesus  He stayed over  We put him in the guest room  He didn't sleep in my room  And that's when he snuck down  And touched me  But you know  He snuck down  Yeah he snuck down  In the middle of the night  In the middle of the night  He wanted to show you a magic trick  Yeah he wanted to show me a magic trick  He couldn't fucking control it  No he couldn't  He had to fuck  He knew  Little fucking Jim Florentine 
[02:59:30]  Was asleep downstairs  He had to touch him  He was losing his mind right  Yeah  He's laying in bed  Staring at the ceiling  Just like  He's down there  He's fucking down there  And I'm  I gotta  No I'm not  I'm gonna control myself  He's just thinking  I'm not gonna do this  I'm just gonna go to sleep  I gotta do this  No I can't  I can't  It's too fucking risky  I gotta fucking  I gotta at least just  I'm gonna peek in the door  I'm just gonna peek  I'm just gonna get out of the bed  I'm gonna go  Take a leak  Alright I'm not gonna go down  I'm just gonna go back to my room now  I just wanna see those big balls 
[03:00:00]  I'm gonna go to the top of the stairs  I'm gonna go to the top of the stairs  Giant balls  Yeah  No I can't do this  I can't do this  Alright I gotta go back to my room  He's right behind that door  Oh god he's right down there  He's right there in that room  He's down there  Oh I hear him breathing  I hear him sleeping  And he even  My parents picked him up at the bus station  At like 11 o'clock at night  I remember it was like a Friday night  So I was already asleep  So when they brought him to the house  He goes  Hey can I go wake up Jim  Tell him I'm here  And I go  No he's sleeping  Just see him in the morning  Here's your room upstairs  And he actually came downstairs  I don't even know how he found the room 
[03:00:30]  Because there's a bunch of rooms  In my old house  So he must have been opening doors  Looking for me  Oh yeah like let's make a deal  He won the fucking big prize  Yes  How stupid were our parents  I know  Cause this shit was happening  To our generation  It just wasn't talked about that much  How stupid were they  They didn't see the signs  What was his MO for being in your house  For your parents even letting them in your house  Well my dad used to take us to the matches  Me and the kids in the neighborhood  So we met him  And he thought  This guy's a little weird  But you know  We'd go buy pictures off him every time 
[03:01:00]  We'd go meet him in the same spot  But I remember when he wanted to stay over a house  And play with all the kids in the neighborhood  All the parents in the neighborhood  Go that's weird  That some 40 year old guy  Wants to hang out with these kids  Let's invite them over for dinner  And feel them out  So I remember he had dinner  At our house  With a bunch of the parents  And the neighbors  Sat around  And they were like  Alright  Let him stay over next week  He's at the table  Just sucking on cocktail franks  Whoa  Yeah he's knocking  He's knocking the pasta off  Cause it looks like pubic hair  I don't want any spaghetti on my plate 
[03:01:30]  Just a plain sausage  He's watching me  He's watching me eat a hot dog  Oh yeah  Just loving it  Unbelievable  That's funny  They had to have a  That's how things were back then  Look  We want to talk to this guy  Before we expose him to our kids  To make sure he's not going to rape them  I know  And meanwhile  They all were terrible judges of character  Yeah really  Horrible  What do you think he's going to say  When he's at dinner  To her your children  I'd like to molest them  Oh shit  Good thing we met with you  You got me  Jesus  Of course he's on his best behavior  Could you pass your son's ass  What do you mean 
[03:02:00]  The potatoes  Yeah  The mash  The mash  The mash  Oh shit  Yeah man  We got the security guard  Guys come up to the apartment  When you know  We get deliveries  And there's already a guy  I will not let my kid  Even see at this point  You just know  So what were our parents thinking  Crazy  I just know  The odds are  That this guy's a creep  Because my little kid  Likes to open up the door  You know  Oh boy  You know  The doorbell ring  Right  And I always look through the hole  And I go 
[03:02:30]  Nope it's that guy  There's no way  Hide the kid  Literally hide  I'm putting him in the room  Hide the kid  Just the way he kind of talks to him  And he kind of like  Touched him innocently  Like just reached out  To grab  You know  Grab his hand or something  And my kid was creeped out  I think they feel that shit  Yeah  Yeah and I said  Nope no more man  When he comes around  Absolutely don't let him  Go to the door  Yeah  But our parents  What the fuck  Were they doing  They were too busy  Drinking and smoking  It just wasn't talked about  Back then  But they had  So you don't think  That they had to 
[03:03:00]  No  It was one of those things  That was kept a secret  And when it happened  They thought it was an anomaly  Because nobody admitted  That shameful shit  So they figured like  Ah it's just  Everybody knows  Who the creeps are  They didn't realize  How prevalent it was  I'm on high alert  You're on high alert  Well yeah  It's also like  With the priests and stuff  When you used to hang out  With them  If someone even told  Their parents  The parents would go  He didn't do that  Don't make that stuff up  Don't cause any problems  Right  Or you just kept it quiet  They were torn  Right  You were kept  No one's gonna believe me  They were torn between  Their faith  And taking care of  And doing the right thing  For your kid  Torn between two lovers 
[03:03:30]  You know  My sister used to  My older sister used to  Hitchhike from high school  That was like  Two miles away  At like 3.30 in the afternoon  Hitchhike home  What a fucking smorgasbord  Your young family was  I know  I know  Fucking molesters  Fucking buffet  The fucking florentines  Were like a flea market  With ass and pussy  Can you imagine  Hitchhiking to high school  As a teenage girl  There's one of those  Florentine kids  You could drive around  All afternoon in your neighborhood  And not even see a kid 
[03:04:00]  That's where we're at today  Yeah never mind hitching  Right  And they were just  Hitchhiking all over the place  Holy shit  They're in the yards  Imagine being a molester  You're just driving around  Fucking losing your mind  It's like a drive-thru  Right  Yeah  Like a pick of the litter  All those  Dirty fucking florentine kids  Just looking  Just asking for it  They would have like  Yard sales  And for an extra five  You could go into any bedroom  And talk to the kid  Of your choice  Just talk  Just talk to one of our kids  Imagine one of those guys  Just driving around  The neighborhoods  Like oh yeah 
[03:04:30]  She's  Nah nah  I could do better  I'm gonna go to the next block  I'm gonna go to the next block  Yeah do you want to  Pick this up  Or you know  Try to go for something  A little better  I'm gonna take a couple more circles  Nah I'm gonna go with  The lazy eyed kid  With the crooked teeth  Ah fuck  Fuck it  I don't have game today  And I'm running out of candy anyway  Wow man  That's fucking  Were you affected by that at all too  I don't think so  It doesn't seem like it  It really doesn't  No I don't  It seems like you  You just saw the big picture  Yeah 
[03:05:00]  Yeah  You kissed for it  You know I never got penetrated  So I think  Yeah yeah  I think that would have been  The line where  Maybe you're affected  Oh I can't wait  Till that memory comes back  I hope it happens  Like you're fucking doing  Panel on Letterman  And he says something  And all of a sudden  You remember like being  Both holes stuffed  Holy shit  Your mouth filled  With the fucking picture guy  And then Ivan Koloff  That's why you wanted  That picture so bad  But if he would have  Offered me his professional camera  I probably would have  Taken it in the shitter  Because I had one of those 
[03:05:30]  Little C110  Little  You know things  Yeah  Oh yeah  Those old school ones  You saw my shitty pictures  The little Kodak  What was it  The fucking like  With that little cartridge  That flipped in  It was very flat  So that guy had  The real camera  So I might have  Wow  Instamatic  A Kodak Instamatic  110 camera  Did it have a flash cube  No I didn't  You'd have to put  The flash cubes  Before you even had  An electronic flash  On the camera  You had to put bulbs  In  Remember that shit  I mean I don't remember  That shit  I was told 
[03:06:00]  Those stories  Growing up  Jim took some  Lousy wrestling pictures  Terrible  No  Yeah I was  You know  How are you supposed  To kiss kids  If your pictures suck  What are you doing Sam  Remember how hot  Those fucking bulbs  Yeah  You'd wait 20 minutes  And they were still  Fucking  Yeah those things  Hold on Sam's taking  You like fucking  Charlie Sheen  In Wall Street  When he goes into  That fucking office  And he's taking  Pictures of all the documents  Yeah look at you  What are you doing  These are great pictures  You're taking pictures  Of his pictures  You probably would have  Done that right  Would you  I would have kissed  Somebody for some 
[03:06:30]  Fucking lick  Yeah see  Why don't you kiss  You for him  Come on  What are you doing  Have Florentine kiss you  If I can get the pictures  Yeah what's wrong  Florentine can you  You know pass it on  I'm not giving these up  No way  No but I mean  This is special  For him to even  Take a picture of your pictures  You should be able  To kiss him on the cheek  Yeah why don't we do that  No not a picture  Yeah yeah yeah  That's a fucking  So what  Florentine should be able  To kiss you on the cheek  There should be a cycle  Of abuse  That doesn't end  I know  That's true  We should keep it going  Right  We really should  It's what the guy  Would have wanted  I think you're absolutely right 
[03:07:00]  If Sam wants to keep  Those pictures  He absolutely has to kiss  Florentine  Florentine what do you want  You want Sam on your lap  Or you want a kiss  He's only  If you'll give me  Like some of the original  Bruiser Brodies  I'll sit on his lap  Oh that see  Yeah  You both see a good abuse equity  In that picture  Yeah yeah  It's worth some abuse  Yeah that's about what I did  For the picture  So  Paid forward  Hopefully some of these  Have gone up in value  Yeah yeah  Went up in value  Right  You know  It was a kiss back then 
[03:07:30]  But  Look  You know  I gotta frame it  I gotta put it on the wall  It's gonna be in my shop  For a while  20 years later  That's a knuckle  But that's a knuckle  I think  Like a year ago  When I was on  Sam looked up  That Ivan Koloff picture  With the belt online  It was like nine cents  Oh really  Because a guy swore to me  That you know  Nine days  This is rare  There's not too many  Pictures of them  With the belt  You're a cheap  Fucking lay  Nine cents  Nine cents  You fucking gave it up  For a nine cent picture  Oh that's nine cents  In 1977  That's gotta be  A quarter  To twenty 
[03:08:00]  Yeah  We have  Starker Patty outside  Even though we're  Supposed to do the show  Let's bring baby girl in  I miss her  By the way  Answer from Dr. Steve  Viagra increases  Blood flow to the muscles  But only at high altitudes  At sea level  It doesn't matter  So when they were  Playing in the Broncos  Maybe in Denver  Yeah  There you go  Yeah  Or increase the blood flow  To the muscles  Someone said  This has been around a while  Supposedly Clemens used it  That's what someone's saying  We have no idea  Jimmy H in Pennsylvania  Well Clemens was  You know  He was always looking 
[03:08:30]  For an edge huh  Well he was also  Banging a lot of chicks  On the road too  A lot of those stories  So he might have needed it  After just doing nine innings  Well the thing is  Yeah if he was doing  Fucking roids too  Then you know  Who gives a shit about that  Before we get Patty in here  Speaking of football  You gotta be loving  The Jets just fucking imploding  And you gotta also love  That fireman Ed  I don't want to brag  You're not a fan  Of the super fan right  I called it though  That the Jets season  Was gonna be a disaster  You did 
[03:09:00]  And I get a lot of shit for it  They're still gonna go  Seven and nine  I'm giving up  They're four and seven  They will go seven and nine  They got an easy schedule  To rest out  But that's  That's a bad season for them  And fireman Ed  You know he's blaming it  On him wearing a Sanchez jersey  That that's why  Everybody was yelling at him  No no Jet fans  Like that guy  Yeah  He's an ass  Everybody makes fun  Of his stupid chant  It's fucking goofy  So none  So Jet fans just heckle him  Cause he's an ass  You don't think he's good though  A good fan  You like fireman Ed  I mean it just said  He sits on his brother's shoulders  I mean how fucking gay is that 
[03:09:30]  That's pretty fucking  How old are you  That's homoerotic  That he's like a 55 year old man  With a fireman hat on  When he used to be a fireman  Like 20 years ago  And he sits on his brother's shoulder  And does a J-E-T-S  Jet shit  And you know what a fireman helmet  Is indicative of  The head of a cock  Do you think he likes attention  The head of a cock  Just picture  I mean cause his balls  And his fucking dick  Is right on his brother's neck  The whole time  And he's holding him up there  And it's even gay  I've seen when they turn him around  So he's in his face  Yes  For the Mets chant  Imagine if he held him like that 
[03:10:00]  Yeah  Fuck him  Let me get this side of the field  Yeah  I got it  That would be really funny  Trying to get a Jets  Right in his face  And Jets chant  Going with your fucking  Your brother's face  Right against your cock  Yeah  There was an article in the paper  That the tickets are going for like  $22, $18 on StubHub  No one cares  They're giving him away basically  Yeah  No one cares  I kind of want to go  Cause Fireman Ed said  He's going to the game  But he's not going to fucking cheer  He's not going to be Fireman Ed anymore  But me and Ann  Have this whole scenario  That they're going to try to beg him 
[03:10:30]  He's going to be like  No no  And then I think maybe  He goes for  No I think he doesn't come back  Until next year  Yeah  Cause there's only two more homes  He said he would still go to the games  Well no he'll go to the games  But he won't be Fireman Ed  Until next year  Next year  Something will happen in the off season  There's only two more home games  So he probably won't be Fireman Ed  Yeah  So he's going to have to leave  His Fireman hat at home  Well he would go on the road  With the team  Well I liked that he put the hat on  Yeah  I liked that he put the hat on  To let you know it was coming  Someone should go  And just  Dress exactly like him  Put the helmet on  And do his whole fucking act 
[03:11:00]  And just  He would be like  Motherfucker  The guy just took my shit  And no one cares about me now  Fireman Dudley  It's just some  Some hillbilly  With a fireman  And he just stands up  And I  He just gets  Raises his chance  Going  Give me a J  E  W  Everyone  The house next door  Fireman Dudley  Wrecks his legacy  Now  I saw you fighting with him  On Twitter  At one point  Oh yeah  That one  I had to do 
[03:11:30]  A lot of these dumb fights  I get into are stupid  I know that  But that one  I couldn't hold back anymore  Cause he's like  He was still a rah-rah guy  And I'm like  Stop  Stop with the bullshit  Yeah  It was fun  I got him with a couple zingers  Told him to  Take his pop-ups  And go  No I know  Yeah  It was good  It was kind of brutal  A loud mouth radio guy  Well then he threatened me  He goes  I'm a fireman  I'm like  Really  Like I don't know fire guys  Like we don't know the NY  You know  It has nothing to do  With what you used to do  For a living

[03:27:00]  Hot meatballs at her  Yeah  No that's a funny song  Put them on our nose  What about anything  But sex  Not butt sex  But anything  Besides sex  Like what about  Giving a guy a hand job  Would you jerk a guy  Off to completion  No I wouldn't violate anybody  That's not violating  What if a guy  What if a guy  Wanted you to  Jerk off his dick  Until he came  Until completion  And wanted you to do it  It's not abusing  Him or anything  Would you do that  Would you do that 
[03:27:30]  And you wouldn't get  Any diseases  Yeah  Would you do that  Patty  You can wear it  Blive  Now what's your reason  I don't know why  Because I'm a lady  You need a reason  You have to know  Why you wouldn't do that  It's  I wouldn't feel right  Well Patty  What if you went on a date  With a guy  And it's like the third date  And you're really liking him  And that's  Eventually it's going to  Get to the sex  It would be more than the third date  Alright the fifth to the sixth  Whatever it is  It would be the hundredth and thousandth  I would be married to him  What  To use your hand on him  You'd have to be married to him  That's how I feel  Patty you've touched my penis before  Yeah Patty 
[03:28:00]  You've touched my penis before  There are exceptions to the rule  Alright  So here's the exception  Grab Jim's dick  And jerk it off  I don't want her to jerk it  But I'd let her touch it  You want to touch Jimmy's dick  You want to touch Jimmy's dick  Oh not today  Not today  You know  I hear it melts thyroid tumors  I think in three months  When  If they do the surgery  To remove half my thyroid  That would come  Holy shit  I thought you were fine  I thought you were alright 
[03:28:30]  Well I am  But they want to see me  In three months  You know  And they want to have  A consultation with me  Next week  How do you pay  For all this shit  You know what  I get  I go to the heal center  At the hospital  Oh boy  Oh is that a wrestling place  No  They give me  Where  That's very lucky  They're dedicated to one small part  Of the human body  It's for uninsured people  Yeah  They go by your income  They gave me 95% off  So I still pay hospital bills 
[03:29:00]  But I pay 95% off  So there's free healthcare  In this country already  Right  I'm not eligible for it  They dropped me  Because I work  You're eligible  If you're getting 95% off  Yeah  That's just the hospital itself  I can't go anywhere else  And do that  It's  How are you paying  Well just go to the hospital then  How are you paying  For all of these tests  And what not  Through the hospital  I get it  Alright  So you can go to a hospital  They cannot  Turn you down  For treatment  In a hospital 
[03:29:30]  They can't do it  They have to treat you  Well another one  Already did  Ryan's Clinton  And I still owe them $500  And they won't see me  Until I pay the $500  Ryan's Click  Ryan's Click  Ryan Clinic  On 10th Avenue  Oh Ryan Clinic  You know that's better insurance  Than like I gotta get something done  And insurance is only covering 90%  And I used to  Yeah yeah  She's got 95%  Yeah  That's nice  But up to two years ago  I had Fidelis  But because they had  Fidelis 
[03:30:00]  Because they had a problem  With the economy  They decided only  Public assistance recipients  Totally would get that care  So it would be better  If you didn't work at all  Wow that's fucked up  It is  That's just crazy  Poor Patty  But at least I have  The 95%  So you need $500  So you can pay  The other bill right  Well yeah  The other bills  I just give them $25  You should go to  Al Qaeda Clinic  For your neck  Well Patty  Just don't pay them  Just don't even go there anymore  Go to a different place

[03:31:00]  Change for your co-pay  They're not even  Cash in those checks  There's not even a record  That you ever did that  I paid them  For Florentine  I just gotta say  She'll keep talking  So I'm gonna tell you  She's uptight about sex  Because of her religious background  Yeah  She got fucked up  By the religion  We're convinced  That you were touched  By one of your foster fathers  Did he used to sleep with you?  He used to come in  He used to sleep with you  She used to take a bath  And he would come in  While she was bathing  During the bath  How about you tell Florentine  About the sleepovers  Yeah what happened  When he used to sleep  On the couch with you 
[03:31:30]  And then Florentine  Will be the judge  If you were touched  We go to another person's house  My brother would sleep in  With my foster mother  And then I had to sleep  By my foster father  Why wouldn't it be  The other way around?  Yeah and how old were you?  I don't know  Ten, nine  Anywhere  So you slept in the same bed  With him?  Well in the same couch  Yeah  And he would put his arms  Around you right?  No  You told us once  That you were like  In a spoon position  His arm would be there  Not a spoon position  His arm would be there  God I fucking hate this guy 
[03:32:00]  So he would lay  He would lay next to you  And you said his breath  Wasn't good?  Don't be such a cock  He's Opie  I don't know  I just thought it was normal  And I just went to sleep  And what about the baths?  What used to happen  When you took a bath?  Well I didn't notice  Really much  Until I was about  Eleven, twelve, thirteen  I started getting  Self-conscious  And then I would want  To close the door  And we weren't allowed  To close any doors  And he would come in  And look at you bathing  He would just walk in  Shave or whatever  Wash his hands  And just leave  Was he ever nude 
[03:32:30]  When he shaved?  Was he ever naked  When he shaved?  Uh no  Probably after the shower  Right?  Me?  Him  God I fucking hate this guy  Did he ever take a dump  While you were taking a bath?  You know I don't remember  Well I noticed  That he would come in  He'd do like things  That were completely unnecessary  Like fucking  Put a facial on  Yeah  Like shit that has  No fucking bearing  On anything  He could have  Washed his hands  In the kitchen sink  Right right  He's washing his hands  He's removing calluses  From his elbows  At least I washed your back  Right? 
[03:33:00]  He would have washed your back?  I'm sure he did  Oh would he help you  Wash your back?  I don't remember that  Your front?  I don't remember that  Little Patty's  Brand new titties  Have we hypnotized Patty yet?

[03:34:00]  A medical condition  Of course he did  Like  I don't know  Some kind of  Palsy or something  Oh no  You know  Like he would shake  And he couldn't  Get up eventually  That was so he couldn't  Palsy walnuts  He couldn't walk  Or anything  You know  He was like  He was faking all that shit  So he didn't have to testify  Yeah right  Yeah  He'd lay his palsy hand  On your clit  No  Get her off  Jesus  That'd be great  He had some kind of  Aphasia or stroke  Or something
