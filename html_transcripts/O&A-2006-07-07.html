<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, along with James Norton, introducing themselves with self-deprecating and offensive terms like "rabid radio retards" and "perverts," similarly insulting their crew.  They briefly discussed their disdain for their "work" and their fondness for women.  A major portion of the show focused on contrasting New York City newspaper coverage of two news stories: an alleged Al-Qaeda plot to flood lower Manhattan via the Holland Tunnel (deemed improbable by the hosts), and a subway attack with sawzalls (accompanied by a bizarrely unrelated Jim Carrey and Jenny McCarthy photo in the *New York Post*).  They played audio of the sawzall victim's account.

The show featured numerous listener calls, ranging from unusual local news stories (a midget mowing a lawn) to personal anecdotes (a caller whose father spent 25 years in prison, a former colleague of Opie's, and a former police officer wrongly convicted).  The discussion also involved the controversy over the Coppertone ad's logo change and Vladimir Putin kissing a young boy.  They engaged in antagonistic commentary about the Man Cow radio show.  The Putin incident remained a recurring topic, with debate over whether the gesture was innocent or unsettling.  The hosts also discussed the perceived creepiness of old Coppertone ads and the changing standards of appropriateness.  A frequent caller, Marge from an animal shelter, was subjected to offensive jokes about her age and appearance, punctuated by prank calls.

A significant portion was dedicated to an IMAX giveaway contest, featuring crude and offensive entries, eventually revealing the winners.  Joel McHale, guest host of *The Soup*, called in, leading to discussions about his show, television programming, and pop culture.  They touched upon shows like "Infarto," a Japanese children's film about pooping, Star Jones' departure from *The View*, and their past bits targeting Tony Danza.  The conversation included homophobic slurs in their commentary on a New York court decision regarding same-sex marriage, and a caller confirmed a fan banner saying "Jimmy sucked my cock and gave me the virus."  They discussed *Lucky Louie* and played a movie trailer parody, "When Opie Met Patty," depicting violence and body disposal.

The XM portion of the broadcast covered technical difficulties during a studio walk-over, street observations, more homophobic language, and derogatory remarks about appearances.  The same-sex marriage decision was revisited, along with their "daily dump report" of offensive listener calls.  They also discussed a new product, the "O&A Party Rock," and briefly interviewed the director of "Minnie's First Time," including a clip of Jeff Goldblum's line "Goddamn rich cunt!" from *Death Wish*.

The interview with the "Minnie's First Time" director covered his experiences working with Jeff Goldblum (including a humorous anecdote about Goldblum insisting on paying for dinner), the film's production, involving Kevin Spacey and Alec Baldwin, and the benefits of acting school over film school.  The film was described as a "twisted," "Lolita-esque" story.  The conversation included tangents on hand gestures in acting, the movie's title and domain name issues, the poster's color scheme, the director's past jobs, and various films (*War of the Worlds*, *The Breakup*, *Swimming with Sharks*, *The Pink Panther*, *The Godfather*).

Craig Newmark, founder of Craigslist, was interviewed next.  The discussion touched upon his wealth, transportation preferences, his customer service role at Craigslist, and his exposure to the erotic services advertised on the platform, described by him as "boring and tedious."  The hosts interjected with sexually suggestive questions and comments, which Newmark deflected.  After Newmark's departure, the hosts discussed the interview, followed by listener calls reacting to it.

This was interspersed with a listener contest for promotional material, leading to a harsh critique of a disgruntled contestant's (B.G.) submissions, causing a lengthy debate and more offensive language.  Other calls included a caller with a persistent unusual vocal tic, and an embarrassing story from Opie about a bowel movement after a movie.  The segment contained abundant crude language, sexual innuendo, and interruptions.

The final segment started with nonsensical, sexually suggestive banter, heavy use of the word "cunt," and speculation about a first-time listener's reaction.  A caller, Lonnie, requested a sound effect of Frank DeFronzo performing oral sex; Opie discussed his own difficulties with it. They mentioned their contractual obligation to end by 11 am, having already exceeded it, and recalled past segments, including a train story and a Saul Rosenberg impression.

A segment from a Dallas Cowboys fan's podcast ("DC Fanatic Radio") was played and criticized negatively with derogatory language.  The broadcast concluded with further crude and sexually charged jokes, including references to a "virus," "celebrity skin cancer," and homoerotic undertones.  The overall tone remained highly irreverent, sexually explicit, and vulgar throughout the entire broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Ovi and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Ovi, Anthony, and James Norton.  Push the button!  Can you hear me?  No!  Shut up!  Me and Anthony!  We're so excited to be back.  Rabid radio retards.  Wow.  We're dummies.  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  We've been known to get our faces in the news.  We're perverts.  Stupid.  We eat stink.  We just love doing radio.  This is a weird show.  No one puts asses in the seat like Greg and Tony. 
[00:00:30]  Ovi.  I love the hitting and the fighting.  Anthony.  I'm a terrorist looking for other terrorists.  James.  I'm a speechless.  Work was nothing.  We all know that.  I love women.  I'm a slumped fat pig.  And a crew of misfits.  Hurricane Ben!  Ben looks like a tall baby.  He looks like Chuckie.  No!  Martini Steve!  Steve is a piece of garbage.  Perfectly enunciating food that we paint him out to be.  Right.  E-Rock!  Well, please, go into a car wash with his mouth open.  I bring nothing to the table.  I don't care! 
[00:01:00]  Shut up!  No!  What's wrong, Eric?  My closet's burning so bad.  Sit down and put on your laughing hat.  Just relax.  Here comes the funny.  Welcome to the Opian Hour.  Shut up!  But enough of this palaver!  Let's get the show on the road!  That's terrible, I'm sorry. 
[00:01:30]  Ow, ow, ow, ow, stop, oh, stop, oh, oh, oh, I can't breathe.  I love you, Johnny Gates.  Those men wanted to have sex with me. 
[00:02:00]  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, don't just stare at it, eat it.  It's Friday, Friday, it's Friday.  Let's wake the F up.  That's terrible, I'm sorry.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show, the O.N.A. virus spreading across America. 
[00:02:30]  Good morning to all.  Hi.  That's right, Donald in Detroit.  Another Friday with O.N.A. across America and Howie in the Hamptons.  Let's not forget.  Yeah.  Who still wants to do radio?  Who's the idiot?  Actually, we don't have a choice yet.  Maybe someday we'll have that fine choice.  One of these days.  To work part-time.  Got to the Hamptons.  1-866-313-3 is our phone number here in New York City. 
[00:03:00]  1-866-313-3.  The real Hamptons, not the fake Hamptons, like we go out to.  To those clubs out there.  You ever been out to one of those?  I went over the holiday weekend to go see my brother play.  To you.  His YouTube tribute band.  Went out to a place out there.  And it's not the Hamptons that you read about.  It's like the Hamptons with the white trash, you know, Long Island people. 
[00:03:30]  Where regular people go.  Right.  Not the exclusive clubs that you got.  No, no, no.  You got to know somebody just to get in the front door.  And then at that point, you're not even in with the celebrities.  No.  There's another section of the club that the real celebrities go to.  Yeah, yeah, of course.  Exactly.  It's just, you know, Nickel Beer Club is not the Hamptons.  I didn't see one bottle of Chrissy, Opie.  Not one bottle of Chrissy passed me by in that place. 
[00:04:00]  But plenty of bottles of Schlitz.  Oh, yeah.  Schlitz for everyone.  Tap beer for all.  Well, I got to tell you, it's very scary to live in New York City.  What do we do?  What do we do here?  We got two huge stories.  You just.  And it just shows you the difference between the two New York papers that we read every morning.  Yeah.  You got the New York Daily News and you got the New York Post.  Now, sometimes they have the exact same headline and story.  The New York Post, barely a newspaper at this point.  We all know that. 
[00:04:30]  If you live in the New York area.  I'm waiting to see Bat Boy on the cover of the Post.  We are a fraction of an inch away from Bat Boy scene in New York City.  Now, I will give you a headline and you guess which paper has this as their front page today.  Okay.  All right.  FBI terrorists targeted Holland tubes.  Tunnel bomb plot.  Huge headline, by the way. 
[00:05:00]  Al Qaeda wanted to blow a hole in the Holland Tunnel.  It's one of the tunnels that goes from Jersey to lower Manhattan.  And the goal was that they would blow a hole in this tunnel and then flood lower Manhattan.  Flood lower Manhattan.  Yes.  They seem to have forgotten about fluid physics.  They seem to.  You can't get the water level higher than your supply of water unless you've got a pump or something.  That's also kind of old. 
[00:05:30]  I remember seeing, especially a few years ago, where they were showing a guy with a video he had taken from the inside of the tunnels.  They wanted to blow that up a long time ago.  Yeah.  There's other problems, too.  I mean, the tunnel itself is 41 feet under rock under the river.  So once you get to the river bottom, you've got to go through 41 feet of rock, and then you'll hit the ceiling of the tunnel.  It's not like it's just a tube where, you know, boats are bumping into it every so often.  Are you wondering?  Yeah.  If it's going to bump all over the thing. 
[00:06:00]  Lay it there like a hose across the river.  Right.  You know, it's dug in the bedrock.  They actually tunneled in the rock.  But there's a big story here today in New York, and I'm sure all over the country, and they don't explain these little facts to you.  No.  They make it sound like this is possible.  Yeah.  It's really not that possible.  And God forbid they poked a big enough hole to get the water flowing, like you said, not enough water would come out to actually flood lower Manhattan.  It would stop at the level of the river. 
[00:06:30]  You may get a puddle here and there.  Maybe.  The initial surge, perhaps.  I think the people in the tunnel would be screwed.  You know.  Yeah.  That would suck.  Sitting there in traffic.  And then just seeing a wall of water coming at you going, oh, great.  This is how it ends.  I'm going to be late.  Wonderful.  Yeah.  But that's the front page of the Daily News today.  And the news is very, very scary with this story.  They're not really explaining much.  Very frightening.  But all you have to do is just a little research and you realize that it's almost impossible. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, there is a quote in the paper here.  It might flood the Holland Tunnel, but that's all it's going to flood, like Anthony said.  But they don't tell you that on the news as they're scaring the crap out of everyone when they, you know, when all they want to do is go to work and make a little living today.  And Kenny actually brought up a good point.  Yes, I said that.  I said that.  Kenny actually brought up a good point.  The Daily News then prints all the vital statistics of the tunnel, how deep it is, why that plan wouldn't work, perhaps a way the plan could work. 
[00:07:30]  The width of each tunnel, roadway, length of tunnel, north tube.  All Al-Qaeda has to do is throw out some ridiculous plot and the newspapers will then tell them how to do it, just in case it won't work.  Right.  They'll help you, you know, fill you in, Al-Qaeda.  Right.  They need a few, just a few more facts.  That's all.  So they just throw that out there and they're like, oh, thank you. 
[00:08:00]  Okay.  So then the New York Times, whatever, you'll get your plans from the newspapers.  But at least, you know, that's something.  You got to admit that they just know how to manipulate the press here in America.  And the people.  Yeah, they keep us on our toes and petrified.  And Al-Qaeda just, they could just make up crap and we will report it and scare the crap out of the citizens of this fine country.  Has there been one threat that we haven't looked at and gone, oh, hey, dude, you hear? 
[00:08:30]  They can pretty much come out and say, we are planning to knock over the Empire State Building.  Yeah.  Oh, we're not going to use bombs.  We're just going to get a bunch of Al-Qaeda members to go on one side of the Empire State Building and just push it over.  And push.  Well, couldn't it be done?  Let's, uh, how many bricks are in there?  You know, but it was built in 19...  What?  Who the...  But we'll report it.  We'll report it and people talk about it and be scared about it.  So...  Because we're, well, petrified. 
[00:09:00]  But they got a suspect in...  Petrified Pete's.  They got a suspect in Lebanon.  Gang sought to flood downtown.  Good luck.  Do a little research, guys.  Good luck, bro.  Good luck on that.  Good luck.  So that's what the Daily News has.  Mm-hmm.  Serious enough that I guess it should be brought to our attention.  Yeah.  Maybe they should explain a little further that it's really not that possible.  Yeah, before putting a big headline.  Especially on the front page.  Right.  On the front page.  Right.  And then you got the good old New York Post. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  Pretty much blowing off the fact that Al-Qaeda at least was attempting to blow a hole in one of our fine tunnels here in New York City.  Not a hint of it on the front page.  No, and I'm trying to find it anywhere in the paper.  It's, uh...  Look at that.  I don't really see it.  But you do get a lovely picture of Jim Carrey and Jenny McCarthy.  They're an item in Malibu walking on the beach.  How about that?  Look at the happy couple.  The new power couple in Hollywood.  Yeah.  That's what you get in the New York Post. 
[00:10:00]  I don't even know how they even have sex with all the laughing they're doing between the two.  Oh, because she just laughs at everything.  She's annoying as hell.  What are they going to come up with?  Come on.  Car-ar-thy?  Oh.  Car-thy?  I don't know.  Jim...  Jenny...  McCary?  Jim?  I'm not good at making up Hollywood names.  Me neither.  Like Bennifer and things like that.  McCary, yeah.  I think McCary is the one right there. 
[00:10:30]  McCary?  That's a good one.  Okay.  McCary.  What was the one they used for Tom Cruise, the other one?  Tom Cat.  Tom Cat.  Mr. and Mrs. Fraud.  Homo?  Oh, that's got legs, though, that story.  Does it?  Everyone's like...  The missing baby?  Where's the kid?  Where's the kid?  This is a little weird.  So anyway, on the front page of the New York Post, they don't cover the tunnel plot. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  Trainsaw Psycho.  We talked about this yesterday.  Trainsaw Psycho.  Carved-up victim tells of Subway Nightmare.  Turns out those saws we were talking about yesterday, they were electric saws, but they  were battery-powered...  Cordless, right.  Cordless or whatever.  So they were on.  Yeah.  This guy was rocking with two electric saws in the subway system.  Two sawzalls.  Both on and just going after this poor guy who's only 4'11".  Double-wielding.  He was dual-wielding his sawzalls.  He already has hell on earth. 
[00:11:30]  For extra hit points.  You gotta wonder after a while.  He already has hell on earth.  He's 4'11", and now he's got some maniac with saws that are on coming at him.  That is the definitive Grand Theft Auto scenario, though.  Running in the subway, you got your two saws, one in each hand, and you just start hacking  at some guy.  In the game, it's great.  In real life, kind of sucks to be that guy.  In real life, not as fun.  Not as fun. 
[00:12:00]  Not as fun to watch.  Not as fun.  Yeah, absolutely.  People were horrified, but doing nothing.  The news reporting, the transit workers just went about their business and did not help  the guy out.  Supposedly, no one helped the guy out.  Yeah, but that's New York.  Sorry.  You get in trouble.  Occasionally, you'll get a hero.  Well, if you see an old lady pass out in the sun, you'll stop and make sure help is  on the way.  Some crazy homeless guy, two sawzalls? 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, you're looking the other way.  Step away.  Step away.  I'm not seeing this.  It is not happening.  Most people have a family to go home to.  They can't be bothered with that crap.  Yeah, you're either going to get killed or you're going to get sued by somebody.  So best walk away.  Just walk away.  So we got audio of this guy, the victim.  The victim.  Poor kooky postal guy.  Yeah, we talked about this yesterday.  So here's the update.  The poor guy, he's just in the subway.  He's 4'11", and this maniac picked him with his two electric saws, and he was stabbing 
[00:13:00]  at the guy, and how many wounds did the guy get?  Do you know it?  A lot.  Everything from little superficial scrapes to some pretty deep wounds.  But the guy won what we call the unlucky lottery.  You know, there are plenty of people down there, I'm sure.  Plenty of people the guy could have attacked.  You're just going about your business, and it's not a slip and fall.  It's not maybe a cab taking a corner when he shouldn't.  It's crazy sawzall guy. 
[00:13:30]  What are the odds you're going to meet up with crazy sawzall guy?  When the police arrest you, and you have two chainsaws in the subway.  Bloody.  Yeah.  They're allowed to just lay you down, put their boot on your face, and shoot you.  And shoot you.  You have nothing to contribute.  Nothing to contribute, and there's really no rehabilitation for this guy.  What excuse can you possibly give that people go, that's why he had?  I had the two sawzalls, and I really needed to cut up somebody with them. 
[00:14:00]  Why?  I really don't know.  Well, here's the latest on the story.  A power saw attack on the subway, and today the man police say is behind.  Do they still have to use that news voice?  This is a pretty left-up story.  You know what it is?  She's almost throwing humor into it because the guy didn't die.  Right, right.  And it's so outrageous that she's got a power saw.  She's almost laughing.  Right.  A power saw attack on the subway, and today the man police say is behind it, has a date in court. 
[00:14:30]  His victim is recovering.  Prosecutors expected to charge 33-year-old Terryton Williams with a slew of crimes.  They include attempted murder and robbery.  Prosecutors say he robbed 64-year-old Michael Steinberg in the number one train tunnel early yesterday morning,  then sliced into the man's chest, puncturing his lung.  Witnesses say Williams grabbed the power saw from a transit worker's workbench.  Steinberg is in stable condition.  Good eyes, transit worker.  Stand by.  He started to hacksaw me like I was a piece of wood. 
[00:15:00]  He tackled me to the ground, and then he was really going after my heart and my lung.  I was trapped.  I couldn't go no place but bed for my life, and all I was thinking about was the fact that my wife is sick.  Police say Terryton Williams got out of prison in February after doing time for drug crimes.  Great.  Poor guy.  He's 4'11".  He's just trying to take care of his sick wife. 
[00:15:30]  He came after me with sores, and my shoes fell off.  Didn't he sound like him?  Yeah, a little bit.  He came after my lungs, my heart, my chest, neck, and head area.  Well, my head was bashed apart, and I lost my glasses and my shoes.  And my wife is sick.  Oh.  He hurt me.  Going after his heart and lungs.  This poor guy.  I just want to deliver letters. 
[00:16:00]  I'm a postal guy, and he was like a hacksaw, like I'm wood.  This is the greatest city in America.  Oh.  And we are being heard in many, many cities this morning.  Yeah.  I challenge the rest of America.  Do you have a psycho like that in the paper today?  Today.  Good luck.  Good luck finding something better than that.  Find us a better psycho than double-wielding saw guy.  That's what we got.  What does your city have today?  Mm-hmm. 
[00:16:30]  Deadbent.  He writes on the Instant Feedback.  Did this guy hop a ramp in slow motion and kill some cops with a flamethrower after all  this happened?  And there was another one, and there was another one, and now I can't find it.  Oh.  Pete from Pennsylvania.  Could the video games your kids are playing, could the video games and your kids, could the video games your kids are playing, becoming to life, will tell you at 11?  Could the video games your kids are playing, be coming to life, will tell you at 11? 
[00:17:00]  But I've read the thing and went, hey, that makes sense.  Could the video games your kids are playing, could the video games your kids are playing, be coming to life, becoming to life, will tell you at 11?  But it's all one sentence.  I know.  A little punctuation, sir.  Maybe a comma, maybe start another sentence.  He didn't even capitalize it when he started his sentence. 
[00:17:30]  Could the video games your kids are playing, I'm trying to even help them out.  It's be coming to life, not becoming.  Right.  He put becoming.  Right.  Instead of be coming to life.  Wow.  Let's say hi to Chris in Arizona.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, gentlemen?  How are you doing this morning?  Sorry about that.  It didn't make sense.  Not very good.  I'm very injured this morning.  Is that because you got stabbed in the chest with some sawzalls or something like that? 
[00:18:00]  It was a big sawzall.  He went for my heart, liver, spleen, and part of my sphincter.  Don't forget about your pancreas.  Oh, my pancreas was grazed, and my socks are still missing.  Poor Saul.  Your city definitely blows our city out of the water.  Oh, yeah.  What do you got?  We don't got anything.  What do you got?  Another boat accident on some lake full of drunks?  Yeah, what do you got, Chris? 
[00:18:30]  That's Arizona's claim to fame every weekend.  Some boater is plowing into some other jet skier on some lake somewhere.  We got good lakes, though.  I did want to make one comment.  You got good lakes.  All right, the tourism commission's on the phone.  Yeah, really.  Well, I am originally from Philadelphia, and I like hearing you guys, that you're back on there.  I stopped back there a little while ago, listened to you on the morning radio.  Can't wait to see you.  No one cares but you.  Thank you.  Thank you, Chris.  I care.  Thank you. 
[00:19:00]  Love you, Jimmy.  Thanks, mister.  That's all you wanted to say, Chris?  Well, then, I guess that's all I wanted to say.  Oh, we were off to a great start today, too.  That was good.  We did some talking and then got, like, our ass kissed.  You know what?  It's nice.  I'm really glad that I bombed the beginning of the show.  Thank you.  And, sir?  We blame you for the first commercial break, Chris.  We blame you.  Oh, we would have went for another ten minutes, no problem.  Ten, a half hour. 
[00:19:30]  Easily.  But now we have to take a break and do what we like to call regroup.  All right?  Our phone number is 1-866-313-FREE.  1-866-313-FREE.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Welcome to the Opie and...  Hello?  Hi, Ma.  Ma, I'm working.  I'll call you back, okay?  Love you, too.  Welcome to the Opie...  Hello?  Ma, I'm working. 
[00:20:00]  I will call you back.  Welcome to Ma, Let Me Work.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Whew, finally.  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Who's the judge?  Ah, it's Friday.  We're giving away IMAX today.  I think we have five.  Yeah.  The judges are hard at work.  We asked for some Opie and Anthony production,  and we're going to give away five IMAX later on this morning. 
[00:20:30]  This is the ONA virus spreading across America.  Let's go right to the phones and say hi to Steve in Rhode Island.  Steve, what's going on?  I'm not too much, man.  What's up?  We're doing a radio show.  That's what we do.  That's why the comment on the whole Jackass Sawzall thing.  Yeah, the Sawzall guy.  Yeah, I mean, honestly, unfortunately, stupidity is not a crime,  because I think video games might have a little bit to do with it. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, no.  I'm a hardcore gamer myself,  but the people that do these ratings on the games are only trying to protect kids.  What's up with, like, trying to protect the stupid adults that will go out and do this?  I don't think this guy was playing video games.  If you've got to look at the guy, this guy hasn't played a video game in his life.  He had that crazy eyes.  He may have played Frogger back in the day,  but he didn't really advance to a bigger and better video game. 
[00:21:30]  He had crazy eyes.  Yeah, he's got the crazy eyes.  He's an ex-con, all that fun stuff.  I just started playing Godfather.  Yeah.  I know it's been out for a while, but just picked it up.  I just got that yesterday.  Yeah, pretty good.  But I'm getting my ass kicked.  I can't really figure out all the fight moves, all the good fight moves.  Because, you know, you normally want to kill people.  You grab a gun or something.  But I got to work over these guys, so I got to beat them to a pulp but not kill them. 
[00:22:00]  And I have no clue, like, all the moves yet.  So I grab them and start punching,  but then the guy turns around and starts really beating me up.  I got to learn how to push them into walls.  And then there's a good move where you swing them around and throw them into things.  I got to learn those moves.  Because I'm just getting my ass handed to me.  Fun game, though.  Godfather.  We interrupt this program to bring you the ozone midget sighting of the day.  Oh, my God.  Who saw this coming?  Let's say hi to Michelle in Buffalo. 
[00:22:30]  Michelle, what's going on?  Hi, guys.  You know, before I mention the midget sighting,  I wanted to tell Opie I used to work at the radio station he worked at in Buffalo.  Hello.  Oh.  Uh, 103.  When it was the Fox, you were there, right?  Uh, yes, I was.  And you worked there until what, 90?  Nine-ish.  90.  Oh, wait, wait.  90.  She's getting scary.  90.  I forget now.  94?  Ah, you know what?  I was a DJ there for seven years.  I started exactly, like, right after you left. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, so we didn't work together?  No, I didn't sleep with you.  Jesus.  So you have no idea who Sponge Buckley is, right?  No, but I used to have been for Shred and Reagan.  You know Shred.  Ah, yeah, Shred's a good friend of mine.  Yeah, and then I was there for seven years.  Then I got fired after seven years, and I said,  Oh, Ray.  It has to happen again.  Then where'd you go?  No, I went back to school for my master's.  In what?  Because obviously you can't hold anyone's attention on the radio. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Well, at least you guys are laughing at yourself.  No, everyone's laughing at you today, Michelle.  But you're too dumb to realize that.  It's just you.  Thanks, guys, thanks.  Anyway, the midget sighting?  Yeah.  Guy lives three doors down from me.  I was driving down my street one day,  and all I saw were hands on a lawnmower.  You couldn't see him.  It was kind of funny.  Now, see, that's funny because he's a midget. 
[00:24:00]  It's too bad half the audience didn't hear  because they went to check out their morning zoo.  Right.  Switch the dial.  All right, Michelle, thank you.  Thanks.  Meanwhile, back at the show.  See, she had a good one.  I mean.  Well, the back story was kind of interesting that she worked there.  She worked there when I didn't work there.  That's always interesting.  Sure.  Then she moved on, let us know what she was doing.  Right.  Oh, God. 
[00:24:30]  Shut up.  Remember she said before that she had some mail  that didn't actually get forwarded?  Oh, enough.  Here's a little secret.  We're not talking to you personally.  Yeah.  This is for everybody's enjoyment.  It sounds like we're your pals and all,  but we're not talking to you personally.  Let's go to Joni in Delaware.  Joni, what's going on?  Nothing.  How are you guys doing today?  Well, we're giving the callers a chance today,  and they're failing miserably.  Well, it sounds like women like to be made fun of, 
[00:25:00]  and I just want to be down here in Delaware.  Oh, boy.  I have some interesting people.  Oh, no.  What is wrong with your phone, Joni?  I don't know.  Am I breaking up for you guys?  Yeah.  What were you saying?  It sounded really like edge-of-the-seat type interesting.  Well, I just wanted to let you guys know  that it's wonderful to have some interesting people  who call it like it is.  Boring.  Thank you. 
[00:25:30]  She got mad.  Hey, it is what it is.  Opinions are out like...  Yeah, we know what opinions are like.  Everyone knows that.  Opinions are like callers.  Or that saying.  Yeah, we do like telling it like it is.  You stink.  Let's go to Jeff in Brooklyn.  Jeff, what's going on?  What's going on, son?  What's up, son?  Chilling, chilling, chilling.  Yeah?  Yeah, man.  I got a cold, but I was like, I'm living up high up in the Sierra Mountains 
[00:26:00]  drinking a champagne cocktail.  Champagne cocktail.  Yeah, man.  What up, Jeff?  What's going on, guys?  I love your guys, son.  I'm fucked up, man.  My voice is fucked up.  I listen to you.  Oh, boy.  This guy.  I heard a groan from the back.  Oh, yo, I got to stop cursing.  Yeah, I heard a groan from the back room.  Yeah, please stop cursing.  They are groaning down the hall right now.  Two in a row.  Two in a row.  God, man.  No, no, no, no.  One more, and we're going to start sounding like we're underwater. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, I know, man.  My voice is a mess.  It's a mess, but I...  Hey, Jeff.  It truly is Friday.  As a black gentleman, how happy are you that we threw one back?  Yo, listen.  Threw one back.  Threw one back?  I think he's talking about the gentleman who was 22 years in jail for a rape he did not commit.  We threw one back, Jeff.  You guys got to be happy in the hood today.  Come on. 
[00:27:00]  Jeff?  That was English?  You hear about that guy?  It's a big story today.  22 years he spent in a joint.  Did 22 years, and then he was found innocent.  On a rape charge?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm saying, I'm saying, but I'm saying he took it for 21 years, too.  Yeah.  21, no, no.  About 10 years ago, I believe, they started thinking that this guy may be innocent, and  then it took about 10 years to finally believe it.  10 years.  He took 10 years to play on me.  Sometimes the wheels of justice turn a little slowly. 
[00:27:30]  All right, Jeff.  We thought you could help us along with this story, but we're going to have to do it ourselves.  We're going to have to do the heavy lifting without you.  Without.  All right, Jeff.  Thank you, sir.  Thanks for listening.  Jeff in Brooklyn, everyone.  Threw one back.  Oh, is that awful?  What?  What happened?  Sometimes.  No, this story is crazy.  He did 21 years in the joint, and DNA proved that he was innocent the whole time.  Yeah.  And, you know, unfortunately, I think most people that go to prison, because we've talked 
[00:28:00]  to convicts over the years, we've talked to people that are still in prison, and they  all swear they're innocent.  Yeah, that's the problem.  So you've got to think it's pretty tough if you're part of the system to try to figure  out who to believe and what case to take on.  Yeah, everyone's screaming, I didn't do it, you know, talking to their lawyers, appealing  things.  So then you get one guy that's innocent, and oh boy, oh well, what are you going to do?  That would be, that's like probably any sane person, that's got to be one of their biggest 
[00:28:30]  nightmares.  There he is on TV.  There he is.  Like, that's got to be...  So glad he still has his 1984 haircut, by the way.  What does he know?  Come on.  How are they not, I think people aren't bitter when they're getting out, because they're so  afraid they're going to say something that gets them thrown back in.  Gets them put back in, yeah.  So they're very like, well, I'm grateful, just very happy to be out, like behind closed 
[00:29:00]  doors, you know.  How do you not just find that prosecutor and spit in his face?  Oh, the prosecutor's probably, well, you know, mistakes are made, but we try our best to  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  These guys never get to sue for that much.  It's like three or four hundred thousand or two hundred thousand.  They never get like that much money.  Like you hear about people getting six million for ridiculous things.  They don't get the kind of money you think they're going to get.  What's their life worth?  They were 22 years in prison.  Yeah, why is that?  Why can't they get a hundred million out of it?  Some kind of crazy amount.  You have to hit people in their pocketbooks.  I think you have to really prove that you were bound for glory, you know. 
[00:29:30]  You were destined.  You were somewhere on the road.  I don't think when they arrested him, he was, you know, working with Bill Gates.  Well, how about this, though?  Maybe you can prove that you were destined for somewhere other than face first in a pillow  while three armed robbers.  This is true.  Well, that's a tough one, man.  That is one of the biggest nightmares, though, I can imagine, is getting put in prison for  not doing anything, thinking, you know, all right, this will blow over pretty quickly. 
[00:30:00]  And then year after year after year goes by.  And you know.  You know.  You know.  You're in that jail cell going, I can't believe it.  I am so innocent and no one knows.  I did not do this.  I did not do this.  And no one is listening to me.  No one's going to believe me.  I did not do that.  Ow.  I did not do that.  Ow.  I didn't do.  Ow.  I did all.  I did all.  I did all.  Let's get a David jersey.  Nice prop you got there, too, Jimmy.  No kidding. 
[00:30:30]  Morning banana.  Dave, what's up?  Hey, good morning, boys.  Hey.  Hey, you're talking about the guy that got locked up for, what was it, 22 years?  Yep.  I was locked up for five years for a crime I didn't commit.  And you're talking about a nightmare.  I've been out for 10 years now.  But it's a nightmare that never leaves you.  Dave, what was the crime?  Tell us the story, Dave.  Yeah, were you, was it proven that you didn't do it?  The hell no it wasn't proven I didn't do it.  I just did my time and I got out.  Oh, then you're guilty.  Oh, yeah, well, apparently.  Sorry. 
[00:31:00]  You're guilty.  What happened?  What was the crime?  It was a theft charge.  Theft?  Yeah, it was a theft charge.  How bad was your lawyer?  Let me say.  What did you steal?  No, my lawyer was actually pretty good.  Actually, well, they said that I stole a computer.  Five years for stealing a computer?  Your lawyer stunk on ice.  Did you rape the person who was holding you?  Yeah.  Yeah, what are you, what aren't you telling us?  Well, there is a big part of it that I'm not telling you, but it's five years. 
[00:31:30]  Wait, wait, what's the big part?  Yeah, come on.  That's what makes good radio.  Five years for stealing a computer, I'm not buying, so you have to come across.  Come on, no one knows who you are.  Okay.  I was a cop.  Uh-huh.  So what happened?  Did you have a stand-up act at night that was very filthy?  No?  Okay, just checking.  Oh, okay.  I used to be a cop, but what happened was because I was a cop and because of this crime,  there's an automatic, you go to jail automatically, there's nothing you can do no matter what. 
[00:32:00]  Mandatory, what's the mandatory sentence?  It's a minimum mandatory up to 10 years.  For anything you do as a cop, for committing a crime, for using...  For committing a crime as a police officer, it's a mandatory prison sentence up to 10 years.  Was it proven that you used your, you know, police influence to steal?  No.  No.  No, none of that was ever proven.  But, you know...  It sounds guilty. 
[00:32:30]  Where'd they say you got the computer from?  From a guy who actually...  A bank.  No, actually from a guy that I knew that owned the computer company.  He even came to court and said it was all...  It wasn't right anyway.  He said that he came to court and said...  And even the...  I mean, it was just...  The whole story is absolutely crazy, but it was...  I 100% didn't do it.  Everybody that sat in the courtroom knew I didn't do it.  The press knew I didn't do it. 
[00:33:00]  Everybody.  And I still got found guilty.  Well, the jury found you guilty.  The jury found me guilty.  I went to trial with this.  They actually came to me and they said,  Oh, look.  We'll give you nothing.  You just say you did it.  Oh, boy.  And you can lose your job.  And I said, you know what?  I'm not doing that.  I didn't do it.  What am I going to do?  Stay there and sit there and say I did it when I didn't?  I'm not doing that.  You know, I should have.  Looking back now, it was probably the right thing to do.  Inbred pest?  I just read that one, too.  From Amish country saying the stolen computer he got caught with was Gary Glitters. 
[00:33:30]  Perhaps that was the problem.  Dave, did you do hard time in prison?  No, no, it wasn't hard time.  You know, it was, I mean, I spent time in a maximum security prison,  but it wasn't as bad as you, it's not as bad as you see on TV.  Like the movies?  Well, a cop in prison's got to be pretty bad, right? 
[00:34:00]  Well, you just don't tell anybody.  Well, don't they all know?  You know, it goes through what they call the grapevine.  Although, you know, it's funny.  I mean, I was there for about a year, year and a half when a guy came in that I had locked up.  You had to kill him, right?  Well, he had no idea who I was.  Yeah, you got to kill him.  He had no idea who I was.  All right.  Well, in that situation, the best thing to do is befriend the guards  and let everybody know that you're friends with the guards and you report to them.  He's in jail, they respect that.  Right, they respect that.  You tell them, like, look, I'll go to the guards with this. 
[00:34:30]  They like being, like, when you're a trustee or something like that.  Yeah, well, that's definitely how you get hurt.  Did you get the job up on the roof and get your guys some beer?  No, actually, no.  No, no.  Lon from Georgia.  How about malicious boredom?  What sense does that carry?  Malicious boredom.  The guy had a story to tell, and we gave him that forum.  Ah, that was Lon, though.  Malicious boredom. 
[00:35:00]  And I agree with Lon today.  Let's say hi to Joe in Jersey.  Joe.  Hey, how many years have you seen in jail unjustly again?  Five.  Oh, which guy?  Which guy?  The guy you just talked to.  Oh, yeah, five.  Yeah, okay.  Well, at least E-Rock was able to watch his movies uninterrupted for five years.  Oh, that's a white guy, though.  Thank goodness.  That was a white guy.  No.  I'm sorry.  The one you threw back then.  I should have stuck with my...  We didn't even have to ask him.  It was like white guy crime.  I'm awful.  A computer theft.  It was a computer theft.  Hello? 
[00:35:30]  At least I can't call him all lucky, Louie.  What, Phil?  I didn't hear you.  Oh, he's just bombing this guy.  All right.  The listeners are bombing.  Hoo-hoo Higgy is saying that that guy's life is the plot of Tango  and Cash, the framed cop in jail.  That's a good movie, man.  Oh.  Help me, Tango.  All right, Cash.  Hey, this is a good point by Chili.  Chili from Cherry Hill.  Come on, man.  Love you guys.  How much money you got that you're living in Cherry Hill? 
[00:36:00]  Not too much.  No, I live on the poor side of Cherry Hill.  Oh.  The west side.  All right.  What do you got?  No, I don't know if it's true or not.  One of the things I heard, a rapist is the worst thing you can be in prison  because all the guards and inmates just throw it right back to you.  So that guy better get something out of this.  You hear things, but then you don't know what's real or what's not  because everybody that gets out of prison, or like you've said,  we've talked to people in prison, they deny all that.  Oh, no, it's great.  You know, I go to pottery class, and, you know, we hang out. 
[00:36:30]  We go to the weight room.  It's never, yeah, last night was the most horrible night of my life.  I lost my manhood to a gang.  It just, you never hear that from guys that have been in prison or are in prison.  It's all movies and stuff we get it from, or those people are just plain lying.  But you would assume that a rapist, yeah, would just be getting it every night.  I think weakness is the worst thing you can be in prison.  Dude, if you're like a really big psychopathic rapist, people aren't going to give you that hard time. 
[00:37:00]  They're not going to screw with you.  No, because you're a problem.  Yeah.  If you're a little fella, like me, I've looked at my ass in the mirror.  Yeah.  I've stood there and gazed over my shoulder in like that Betty Page stance.  Oh!  Oh!  Jesus, dude.  I love you, Johnny Cakes.  Like the, like the Coppertone girl.  Yeah.  I wish I knew how to quit you.  Got a little dog to pull down your swim trunks, did you?  Yeah.  Just a little peek over the shoulder. 
[00:37:30]  And I'd be, I know that I'd be, I'd be, that's why I live a straight and narrow life.  I, I, I...  For the most part.  Yes.  Yeah, I mean a little dabble in the old sex industry, but I pay my taxes, I don't steal,  I don't, uh, I don't smack people in the head.  Yeah, that's what you gotta do.  Because I don't want to go there and have these little buttocks ravaged.  You know, speaking of that Coppertone, that famous picture, it's like a little...  Changed it.  You know, right?  Yep, I noticed the other day.  They changed it.  You know the Coppertone, it used to be, I guess it was a little girl, right?  Little girl, she's walking down the beach and her little dog comes up and bites the back 
[00:38:00]  of her little bathing suit.  And pulls it down.  By her bottom.  Just a little bit.  Just pulls it down enough to show little cartoon butt crack.  Butt crack.  Just over there.  And you can see the tan lines.  Like the tan lines.  Betty Boop?  No, it's not Betty Boop.  It's the...  How do you not know the Coppertone ad?  The famous Coppertone ad.  That's why I'm...  The famous Coppertone ad.  Well, because it is a cartoon.  It's like a drawing.  But the little girl, I think she's even in pigtails or something, right?  Yeah.  It's been used for years, since like the 50s.  It's the Coppertone ad, where the dog is holding her little bikini bottom back, and you 
[00:38:30]  see her tan line, and that's like the logo.  For Coppertone.  And they changed it.  Now the dog grabs the back of her bikini thing, but you don't see any butt crack or any tan  line or anything.  You mean a company actually didn't want its logo to be a dog ripping the pants off a  child?  Wow.  I mean, that's odd.  Yeah, but they got away with it for 40-some-odd years.  Maybe 50 years.  So did the Catholic Church.  Certain things have to change, and I'm not big at anything.  Why does that have to change?  A child's prepared to be torn off by a dog.  You know what it was? 
[00:39:00]  Let me tell you.  Let me tell you.  It was very innocent.  You never thought anything of it when you saw it.  But now that they changed it, it makes you assume that it was something dirty and nasty.  Well, I understand the dog came out and finally...  Oh, the dog.  It was the dog.  They found stuff on his dog computer.  They had pictures of that Coppertone kid.  This is great.  Do we want to go down this road for a while?  Joe in Jersey.  Oh, sure.  Joe, what's up?  How do you do, Joe? 
[00:39:30]  Hello.  Hey, Dave, Joe.  What's up, Joe?  How you doing, buddy?  Tell you, mine.  Are you talking about prison rape?  Well, I guess.  That's all we think about.  All right.  Well, my old man, he's 55.  I'd say he spent about 25 years of his life in prison, but the one story that he did tell me...  Wait, he spent 25 years in prison, your dad?  Yeah, he's 50.  Yeah, 55.  Why?  Why 25 years?  Drugs.  The last time was for kidnapping.  Jesus.  He locked a guy up in our garage for three days. 
[00:40:00]  For three days?  Yeah, that was the last time when I was a kid.  Well, why did he do that for three days?  What do you do when he got up for three days?  What do you do at night?  You've got to kill him after that.  When did you know your dad was a little different than the other dads in the neighborhood?  Right around when the police started raiding the house.  You had all sorts of baseball equipment, and no one was playing baseball in your house.  Yeah, sir.  Well, he wasn't playing catch with me.  Let's put it that way.  All right.  So he went to jail for a long time. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  So the point of the matter is the first night in, he was, I guess, penning a letter to  my mother, and three of the coloreds started walking in.  Jesus.  And he told me he just sharpened his pencil and bam right in the eye.  Just stab him right in the eye.  I see some of your father's racism has rubbed off on you.  I'm sorry.  What was that?  Nothing, sir.  That's racist.  I ain't messing with Joe.  It sounds like he may be connected.  Well, he could use terminology from this century.  What?  To say that the gentlemen were colored?  That's fine. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  I think you should only use those words in the comfort of your own motor vehicle.  Thank you very much.  With the windows firmly rolled up.  Actually, it's the word vehicle.  And the music blasting, just in case.  Very good.  All right, Joe.  Thanks, my dog.  Thank you.  You don't hear any guys call up and go, you know, I fought valiantly, but they got me.  We were surprised to see the Coppertone dog come into the house.  Would you take a seat, Coppertone dog? 
[00:41:30]  Let's see what you brought.  Some doggy biscuits.  Some Zima.  Peanut butter.  Peanut butter.  Wow.  Hoo-hoo Higgy from the Jersey Shore.  That Coppertone.  Oh, it updated.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Why does it do that?  Because we got a very, very interactive audience.  That Coppertone bottle was the best.  How can you beat pedophilia and bestiality on one bottle of lotion?  There you go. 
[00:42:00]  And I did hear that the Coppertone girl was actually modeled after Jodie Foster as a kid,  but I don't think that's true, because it was before that.  No, I think it's true.  Later, that dog shot the president of the United States.  Happened.  Okay, terrific.  Unfortunate that in these awful times, certain innocent things do have to suffer.  Yes.  But, you know, they may not have been as innocent as we think.  Anyway, their inception may have come from some deviant.  Could have been.  Who thought, wow. 
[00:42:30]  Wait, you agree with them changing the Coppertone logo?  I don't actually remember the logo.  Someone could show me the logo.  They're taking our freedoms away, man.  Man.  I'm completely.  I look at everything like as a deviant would.  I look at things and go, wow, that's kind of weird.  But I never thought of the Coppertone ad as anything but what it was, you know?  If it was dreamt up by some sicko, that's not the way I think the majority of the country saw it.  It was almost, it was like a national icon for summer. 
[00:43:00]  You saw that.  You knew, you know, summer was here.  Have you tried the Coppertone spray yet?  No.  Oh, my God.  Good stuff.  Oh.  Suntan lotion has finally improved drastically.  Suntan lotion.  Well, you know, you use that.  And you get sand and, you know.  Now it's just a spray.  Yeah.  Spray it on.  Done it in seconds.  I heard the new logo is actually the Russian president kissing you tan.  Oh, all right. 
[00:43:30]  Let's do that next.  Putin.  Oh, let's.  What a creep.  Stupid me.  I'm like, oh, it's just got to be a Russian thing.  That's what everyone assumed.  But no, they're just as pissed over there.  It's not a Russian thing.  No.  We'll talk about it next.  It's the only virus spreading across America.  It's like punch sound, woman scream, opium anthem.  That's right.  The Opium Anthony Show. 
[00:44:00]  In a little while, we're going to give away five IMAX.  This is the Opium Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  What's up, Pittsburgh?  What's up?  Look what we do.  Pittsburgh.  We make it all about Pittsburgh.  And I've seen the Coppertone ad that Eric gave me.  This is basically an assault.  The plants are halfway off.  This is awful.  I do believe this ad could be from, like, the 40s. 
[00:44:30]  Well, we were just bitching and complaining before the break that the Coppertone logo, they changed it.  You know, the classic logo is the little girl in pigtails looking over her shoulder as her dog is tugging her bathing suit bottom down.  To show that she's got a tan.  And before the break, we said that the dog's pulling down the bathing suit just a little bit.  A little.  To show the tan lines?  No.  Well, we just got a picture, and, uh, yeah, the dog pretty much has her bathing suit bottom completely off. 
[00:45:00]  She's around her ankles, and he's dragging her through the yard.  As a matter of fact, I do believe these should be destroyed immediately lest we be arrested.  It really is.  It's all how you look at it, though.  To me, that's still very innocent.  Of course it is.  Till the peanut butter comes out.  But now the, uh, the new logo, I mean, they don't, they don't pull it down at all, right?  No.  Let's say hi to Kathy in Boston.  Kathy, what's going on? 
[00:45:30]  Hey, did you see the new Kool-Aid commercials?  The pitcher, the, you know, non-gender-specific pitcher even wears pants.  They even got the Kool-Aid guy or girl or whatever that thing is wearing pants.  It's the Kool-Aid, yeah.  The big pitcher with the face kind of drawn on it.  But, uh, I don't remember him.  Did he used to not have pants?  Yeah.  Oh, okay, there he is.  No pants.  Because all his was a played head and legs.  All right, and now he's got, he's got pants.  Now he's got pants. 
[00:46:00]  But now he's almost got like a, he's got like a crotch.  He's got SpongeBob Squarepants on.  Like he's got legs and, and a, uh, a midsection and, and he's covering something up with the  pants.  Yeah.  Yeah.  In the old one, it's just legs coming out of the bottom of a pitcher.  Yeah, because there's a lot of gender parts under a pitcher.  Yeah, it's kind of silly.  Yeah, it is.  I think this guy's hotter though.  Looks like a real man.  He's sporting something. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  All right.  The banana flavored.  Last night, Jimmy, thank you, thank you, thank you.  What?  I watched the Louie marathon.  Thank you.  Oh, cool.  Thank you.  Glad to.  Yeah.  All, uh, four episodes were on HBO last night.  Yes.  I'm on tape and I did pay-per-view.  I mean, on demand or whatever.  Oh, cool.  Ah, very good.  I demand it.  I demand it.  All right.  Thanks, Kathy.  Bye.  Bye.  Hey, uh, Jim from Chicago.  I guess he's trying to get to us.  I don't know.  Uh-oh.  Oh, no.  Oh, I hate when we, they try to get to us. 
[00:47:00]  Uh, Jim writes on the instant feedback.  He's listening to the show, so he must enjoy the program on some kind of level.  Uh, why do you guys feel the need to, ah, just updated.  Always updates.  Okay.  Uh, why do you guys feel the need to talk S about Man Cow?  Oh, boy.  He is more successful than you two morons.  Uh-huh.  And that other guy.  Hey.  You're just that other guy.  With three morons.  It's Jim Norton.  That's right.  And these dummies are open, Ant.  Right.  Why do you guys feel the need to talk S about Man Cow? 
[00:47:30]  He is more successful than you two morons, and that other guy will ever be.  Really?  In big capital letters, by the way.  How do we?  He has more listeners and a more loyal fan base.  The Man Cow Militia wins again.  Oh.  Nuff said.  All right, well.  Jim, I think you've done more damage with your, uh, instant feedback than we could possibly  do.  Jim, um, Man Cow's in Chicago, and then he's, uh, in a bunch of very, very small cities. 
[00:48:00]  There's a huge drop-off after Chicago.  Yeah.  When you're talking about maybe some small little town in Montana.  We're one of the biggest shows on XM Satellite Radio, and we're syndicated.  How many stations are we up to today?  A hundred.  We're up to 12, with more to be, uh, announced very, very shortly.  Very, very, very.  I'm throwing another variant shortly.  Right.  Well, Man Cow, in his penthouse article, took a couple shots at us on XM yesterday. 
[00:48:30]  We beat him up nicely.  Yep.  And we, uh, we, uh, let out some info that, uh, his own company there in Chicago hasn't  even re-signed him yet, and he, he may not be re-signed by the current employer.  That's right.  And that he, uh, he called Steve Dahl recently.  There's actually tape of Man Cow leaving a message on Steve Dahl's, uh, answer machine  there, uh, cause Steve Dahl works for this fine company, CBS Radio, and was basically asking  Steve Dahl to put in the good word, uh, and, and get, uh, CBS Radio to hire Man Cow. 
[00:49:00]  Oh.  Well.  Wouldn't it be something if we, uh, had heard something from, uh, the top that that would  never happen?  That would be something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good luck to ya, militia.  The Man Cow Militia.  Ew.  Lead belly.  Man Cow Militia.  Ew.  Ew. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  Good luck to ya.  Well, there you go.  I guess you got to us, buddy.  What can I tell ya?  Anyway.  That is, uh, wow, some battle.  Oh, so, uh, we got to talk about Putin.  Putin.  Putin.  Putin.  What a creep.  I don't know.  What?  It wasn't that bad.  You, what?  That was, wait a minute.  So inappropriate.  You have a president. 
[00:50:00]  You have a big problem with the Coppertone logo.  Sure.  But you don't have a problem with, uh, Putin.  It's a cartoon dog and a cartoon girl.  I know.  And this is a real, a real five-year-old boy and a real president of a superpower.  It's the kid's stomach.  And, and for some reason, but it's not something they do.  It's not a Russian thing.  See, this is, this is where we're confused.  Because I go, Anthony, it's a Russian thing, right?  He goes, no, even, even the people in Russia, and it's still Russia.  I don't care.  They split it up into 80 million countries. 
[00:50:30]  Well, it is Russia for them.  Yeah.  Yeah, but it's all individual countries now or something.  It's not the Soviet Union.  It's still the Soviet Union.  Oh, you still call it the Soviet Union?  Yeah, why not?  It's too complicated the other way.  Yeah.  You know, all these athletes, when you watch the Olympics, uh, formerly of the Soviet Union,  now, uh.  Frack Frack Danistan.  Yeah, exactly.  What?  Where?  They're still the commie bastards.  The good old days.  That want our blue jeans.  Our blue jeans and American toilet paper. 
[00:51:00]  Very good.  So, are you being serious, Jimmy?  Yeah, because I think it was, it's such a, it wasn't like they caught him doing that.  It wasn't like he, he was seen doing that.  Oh, yes, they did.  What?  Well, they caught him.  No, no, but it was, it was in front of a whole bunch of people, right?  Well, yeah, it was like something you didn't.  He couldn't control himself.  Well, we haven't even explained yet to our fine listeners.  No, I think.  Do we need to?  That kid was cute.  That guy's a creep.  And, of course, it's the post.  I'd rather have old ink-stained head in power there than this, uh, this creep. 
[00:51:30]  The headline, belly bizarre behavior, you gotta be kitten.  Hmm.  It says you gotta be kitten.  Oh, that's the headline because of his comments afterwards, yes.  Belly bizarre behavior, like instead of very.  Russian president.  Vladimir Putin said he kissed this boy on the belly because he wanted to stroke him like a kitten.  Hmm, yeah.  Da-na-na-na-na-na.  Hey, da-na-na-na.  He's off now on a political trip to Thailand. 
[00:52:00]  After a week of frenzied speculation across Russia, President Vladimir Putin finally explained yesterday that he had kissed a young boy on the stomach in the Kremlin because he wanted to stroke him like a kitten.  Yeah.  What the F does that mean?  He said he walked up, he saw this boy, he looked very independent, he looked like he was just standing there alone, and he had this, uh, compulsion that he just wanted to, um, kiss his stomach. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, the normally.  And stroke him like a kitten.  That's what he said.  The normally dour former KGB officer insisted it was a spontaneous decision to approach the five-year-old who was among a group of tourists to lift his shirt and kiss his stomach.  Maybe it loses something in the translation.  In Italian, it's so much nicer.  It's like, uh, he treats him like a schmuck.  What, you're still talking?  What, you're still kissing that boy? 
[00:53:00]  Well, in Russian.  Look, the mother's looking this way, the father's looking that way, and there's the president in the middle, kissing his stomach.  What do you want from me?  Here's his quote.  People came up and I began talking to them, among them this little boy.  He seemed to me very independent, uh, sure of himself, and at the same time defenseless.  Yeah, so to speak.  And an innocent boy and a very nice little boy, uh, Putin said, I tell you honestly, I just wanted to stroke him like a kitten, and it came out in this gesture. 
[00:53:30]  There is nothing behind it.  It's completely innocent.  Why, are you always crying?  Why don't you just settle down and find someone over 18?  Find a nice boy.  Settle down.  Just kiss the kid's stomach.  It means nothing.  It's a little creepy.  It is a little creepy.  I've seen babies who I just wanted to kiss their little fat hands or whatever.  It doesn't mean anything.  We've allowed perverts to hijack nice, real affection. 
[00:54:00]  That's an odd thing to do.  It is very odd to do.  But there's nothing dirty about it.  There's nothing awful about it.  But it's not even part of their culture.  Coppertone ad creepy.  Yeah.  Putin kissing boy belly, not creepy.  You are a little off on this one, my friend.  I don't say Coppertone ad creepy.  I can understand why it's inappropriate.  This is a dog ripping the underpants off a youngster.  All right.  I can see why you wouldn't want that as your product's face.  Hi.  Your product logo.  This will keep the sun off you.  What?  The dog attacking the child? 
[00:54:30]  I see.  It doesn't tie in at all.  Her little bottom, tee hee hee.  Well, you know.  Oh, look.  I have tan lines.  I'm three.  Tee hee hee.  All right.  I can understand that.  Maybe I have a point as a corporate way of go.  Stop taking away our innocence, Jimmy.  Growing up, we didn't think that.  I know.  We didn't think that.  We're just like, oh, Coppertone, look at this cute little picture.  That's all.  But then we got computers and we're like, everything changes.  I mean, look, let's be honest.  It's a disgusting society.  Yeah.  That's why what Putin did is even looked at as odd.  But that is odd. 
[00:55:00]  It's a strange boy.  It's somebody he has no clue who this is or what.  And, you know, even Hitler just gave him a little pat on the cheek.  And you know what a creep he was.  Yeah.  Then have a chocolate.  Yeah.  He gave him a little pat on the cheek.  Maybe tussled their blonde little locks and said, I wish I had a hundred generals just like you.  Yeah.  And then sent him on his way to get killed.  I'm just bothered because it looks like a younger version of me.  I got a little Opie. 
[00:55:30]  I got pictures that look exactly like that.  A little skinny little R.  Skinny kid.  It looks like me and Uncle Skip.  I'm definitely bothered by that picture.  You're right.  All right.  That is a little odd.  I think if, you know, President Bush did something like that, don't you think that would be a little odd?  Yeah, it's a little odd, but not dirty, not inappropriate.  I don't think I, you don't do that in front of people in the Kremlin and expect to get away with it.  If it's, I can see if they walked in and he was in a men's room and he goes, oh, I just met this lad and kissed his stomach. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  That's inappropriate.  But to be so compelled to do it that you are doing it in such a public forum like that.  Jimmy.  Is weird to me.  I got an idea.  Okay.  You think that's very innocent, right?  Yes.  Go outside this studio right now.  Right.  The first boy you see under the age of eight to do exactly what Putin did.  Sure.  Surround me with KGB security.  I'll be happy. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah, that might help.  You would either get your teeth kicked in.  No, you would get your teeth kicked in and then you would be arrested.  Well, yeah.  But again, these politicians are always kissing babies.  They're always hugging babies.  They're always picking up little kids.  They've done that forever.  There's a way to do it.  You pick him up, you pinch his little cheek like Harry S. Truman did, you turn him around  to the crowd, and then you give him a little kiss on the cheek and hand him back to mommy  so mommy can later take him home and be beaten by daddy like the good old days. 
[00:57:00]  How about these idiots in Spain running from a bull?  I mean, what's the difference?  That, to me, is stupid behavior.  Why would you...  Well, that is stupid behavior, yeah.  That sounds like a really hacky segue, like I'm a stand-up doing a bit.  And it's funny, the bulls, right?  What are they doing?  Did you hear about this running of the bulls thing?  That really was quite the turn.  I just caught it out of my left eye peripheral on the TV, and this ham-handed segue, it won't  do.  There's a bunch of people that, unfortunately, a couple of them hung up at the same time, 
[00:57:30]  but a couple of people agreeing with Jimmy.  Yeah, it's completely harmless.  No, I mean about the, you know, the Cobbertone thing.  Yeah, it's creepy.  Yeah, but why would you have to put the pants on the Kool-Aid guy?  That's true.  I want a nude Kool-Aid man.  I don't know, maybe because of all the robbery break-ins, they kind of figured that this big  thing kicking your wallet with a beverage...  And no pants.  No pants and beverage.  Hi, kids, have some.  Drink this.  I have no pants. 
[00:58:00]  It's just the wrong message to send.  It's a different world.  It really is.  I think that's what it is.  Drink my Kool-Aid.  I want to be naked.  Yeah.  Come on, everyone.  Take your pants off.  Let's have Kool-Aid.  To show black people, you know, when they're in the 40s and 50s with big pink lips and cartoon  sandbar, I mean, that was acceptable, and now you're looking at it as barbaric, so...  Joe from Brooklyn.  Hey, Joe.  How is it not Russian culture?  Putin was just doing a vodka body shot out of the kid's belly button. 
[00:58:30]  Right.  Whatever gets him through the day.  And there's nothing wrong with it, because Tax, well, his last name we can't say over  here, but we can say it over at XM.  Tax blank says, Putin did say no homo, so it's all okay.  Then technically, there isn't a problem.  And this is just hitting below the belt.  Oh, and I don't mind the cobertone.  No, it was right above the belly button.  No, well, now we're going back with it. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, sorry.  Uh, this is just, uh, this is, this is going too far.  Oh, and I don't mind the cobertone ad, because it reminds them of their girlfriends on vacation.  Oh, that old gag.  That's not nice, really.  There's a few I can't read.  Let's go to Ben in Jersey.  Ben?  Yeah, um, I'm pretty happy they're updating all these ads.  It's kind of good for the times.  Like, uh, they did the Aunt Jemima ad.  They had, they added, uh, ten babies and a crack pipe. 
[00:59:30]  Jeez.  Okay.  I think it's rather appropriate.  Inappropriate.  Bell must be rung on that one.  They did update Aunt Jemima.  They gave her a sensible hairdo.  Aunt Jemima used to be, uh, like a, uh, what would you call a mammy?  A mammy.  Like a mammy.  She just had a do-rag around her head, and she knew how to make flapjacks for some reason.  She wore the big house coat thing, or the, uh, the, uh, apron, and she looked like she  was right off a plantation.  Like she was, you know, working the house. 
[01:00:00]  And, uh, now, she's got a sensible hairdo, the little pearl earrings, I guess, and she  looks like a businesswoman.  They changed her around a little bit.  Same thing with, um, Uncle Ben.  Uncle Ben, the Rice guy.  Oh, yeah.  They changed him around.  He was a guy that every time I saw him on the Box of Rice, he just pictured a story.  Let me tell you about 1938.  I could tell you what it was like being a black man in Alabama.  And now, you know, he's, uh, again, another, like, businessman type guy. 
[01:00:30]  With a bow tie.  Successful guy.  He's got the bow tie.  I think he has a bow tie, right?  Does he?  I don't know.  I don't know.  He just looks successful.  He just looks like he, uh, has a bow tie now.  They've changed these things, though, and, you know.  He's in the nation of Islam.  Brother Ben Al-Shabazz.  Somehow, they've made the rice black.  He hates the white rice.  He only eats the brown.  White rice is dirty. 
[01:01:00]  He recommends you buy it and throw it on the floor and step on it.  Oh, you could use the devil's rice.  Let's say hi to Heather in Tennessee.  Tennessee, I guess we're blown up in Tennessee.  A lot of phone calls from Tennessee.  Hey, Tennessee.  Heather, what's up?  Well, I was just saying that, uh, it probably got lost in translation.  He was probably actually trying to zerber the kid.  What?  Like a...  Yeah.  Yeah.  That sounds like a purr sound, you know?  Yeah, well, people do that with, like, relatives. 
[01:01:30]  Girlfriends, too.  Or girlfriends, yeah.  Well, you kiss their stomach and go...  Stop!  Stop!  Woo!  And they giggle.  Yeah.  Because they're in the hospital paralyzed and they can't feel it.  The other thing I wanted to comment on was the whole Kool-Aid ad thing.  Oh, yeah.  You know what he's hiding in his pants?  What?  His package.  They come in little packages, Kool-Aid.  They do.  Right.  The little...  You rip it open and, uh, yeah. 
[01:02:00]  Um, women are banned from the show today.  Wow.  That was a cute little...  You guys are 0 for 3.  It was a cute little...  Although, we do have the return of Marge.  I'll give her...  I'll give her this.  Back goes Griffey looking up.  And it's out of here!  Yeah!  Or is it?  No, it's back to the wall.  My mistake.  Ah, so close.  Hey, uh, Marge.  My mistake.  Okay, well, first of all, guys...  Remember Marge, guys, from last week?  Marge, from the little shelter out in, uh, Northport.  No, Huntington. 
[01:02:30]  In Huntington.  In Huntington, whenever it's right on the border of Northport.  How are you, Marge?  Warner Road.  First of all...  Yes, Marge?  I have...  I have gotten such feedback from everybody that said...  Well, that's fantastic, Marge.  Oh, gee.  Come on.  Give me...  Give me one second of uninterrupted airtime.  You got it.  One.  You don't...  Do you realize our airtime is worth $5,000 a minute at this point?  That's it?  And you want to know something?  If little shelter could afford it, we would buy it.  I understand, Marge.  Everybody has said how mean you are to me. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  By wishing me dead.  We...  Who wished you dead?  We didn't wish you were dead.  We just said that how funny is it that you're supporting, like, dogs and cats and stuff,  and one day you're going to be dead in your body, and your little doggy is going to be hungry,  and...  Oh, and probably nibble on you a little.  ...gnawing at one of your limbs because he doesn't have a choice.  Well, that's not the way I heard it, but you know what?  I can...  Why?  That's better?  What's the matter, Marge?  It's just the little dogs, the little cats need your help so much. 
[01:03:30]  The Harley raffle is so important.  You know what I've been doing, guys?  What have you been doing, Marge?  I'm not telling you my real age, but you know my motto that...  62.  You're 62 years old.  Okay, here's the deal.  I have no idea.  I've been actually taking the Harley raffles into bars and trying to get guys to buy it.  I've been stopping guys on the street that are on motorcycles and trying to get them 
[01:04:00]  to hand out the raffles to somebody else.  Now, I'm a woman that has a very, very fine reputation.  Yeah, of course.  And if any of my neighbors have seen this, I'm sunk.  There goes the reputation out there.  Have seen what?  I'll be like you guys.  Marge, have seen what?  In the bars.  Yeah.  You know, going in and out of bars.  Oh, you're going in and out of bars and stuff.  And if your neighbors see that, they'll think ill of you because you're not that kind of girl. 
[01:04:30]  Woman.  Well, I'm trying to be nice.  Are you banging the bikers?  Right.  You're going into biker bars?  I almost had an accident the other day.  I was stopping bikers as they were riding on the streets.  Oh, boy.  That doesn't work.  I mean, it doesn't work.  Here's what you've got to do.  Marge, let me give you a suggestion.  Only try to sell to guys with either the name Pagans on the back or Hell's Angels.  Okay.  Because they're very charitable and they'll help you out. 
[01:05:00]  So I've heard.  But you know, at my age, my sight isn't that good.  Right.  So all I see is a bike and I figure stop, even if you have to stop traffic, and get  the message across.  That's a good safe thing to do.  Now, the other thing.  Who am I speaking to, Opie or Anthony?  Do you like who you're talking to right now?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, then that would be Opie.  Anthony.  Now, here's what I would like you to do.  All right.  Oh, boy.  By the way, the phone's just exploding.  Oh, yeah.  A lot of animal lovers out there that want to talk to Marge. 
[01:05:30]  We'll talk to Marge.  A lot of people that heard you last time, they want to get on the phone with you and  support your cause this time.  And I'm sure we'll talk to some people, perhaps new people in new markets, perhaps familiar  people that we've heard from before.  But, Marge, people want to talk to you.  You're a good personality.  Oh, thank you, darling.  And you guys are very good-looking.  I didn't even realize.  Oh, well, thank you.  Your eyesight is bad, isn't it?  One blind, one brunette. 
[01:06:00]  All we need is a redhead.  And then we have a whole menage of twat.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Now, wait a minute.  Hey, that's my bit.  I'm stealing it.  Here's the question.  Here's the question before you cut me off.  What?  Oh, we wouldn't cut you off.  No, because honestly, the phones have exploded with animal lovers defending Marge because  they thought we were too harsh on you last week.  Well, you were, guys.  I know, Marge.  What can I tell you?  Treat me as you would your mother.  Ah, I killed her with a shovel. 
[01:06:30]  Well, listen, I can't.  But that's okay.  The phones are lit up, Marge.  Please, you got it.  You're like, you're really hitting a nerve with people, and we want them to be able to  talk to you.  So, you want to take some calls?  Yeah, why don't we say hi to Poe.  Poe in Literal Town.  Literal Town, Idaho.  Okay.  Hey, Poe.  You're on with Marge.  Gentlemen, I object to the treatment of Marge last time.  I felt it was a bit harsh.  She's doing a good thing. 
[01:07:00]  Marge, are the animals free?  No, there's a charge for them, Paul.  But you know what?  It really costs a lot of money to take care of these animals.  Ramone, bring me a stroke system.  Ramone, Marge has the bladder control of a diabetic chit-su.  Ramone, bring me some adult diapers and dead friends.  Paul? 
[01:07:30]  It's Poe.  It's Poe.  Yeah, Poe.  And I don't know how he got through.  Obviously, that was a prank call, Marge.  We don't support that when you're trying to do a good thing out there on Long Island.  Not at all.  For the little doggies and the little cats.  I'll talk to anybody about animals.  But will you still give me 30 seconds to ask for me to be in an ad?  You try, you try, and these people just don't understand.  We're trying.  You know, just think about this.  All right, let me think.  Hold on, we're thinking. 
[01:08:00]  What?  You were both little boys.  Little boys.  And you, you know.  Oh, by the way, someone made a joke.  No, I wasn't the child that Harry Truman was kissing.  Wait a minute.  You remember, pictures.  Bastards.  Pictures.  Yes, yes, yes.  You know, little boys and their dogs.  Ah, yes.  Just keep this picture.  It's classic Americana, Marge.  And when you think about it.  So when the two of you were not in reform school.  Reform school?  The little rascals?  Yeah, then you know what it means to have a dog or a cat at your side. 
[01:08:30]  You know, when I was at Boys Town.  Yeah.  They locked me up in Boys Town.  I couldn't have a dog or a cat.  Although, a dog used to come to the back window and we'd give them graham crackers.  Now, do you remember who was the priest at Boys Town?  No, because this was in 1925.  Come on, guys.  Let's get some trivia.  What?  All right.  Let's get some trivia from Marge.  Some trivia from Marge.  All right, Marge.  Spencer Tracy.  Spencer Tracy was in Boys Town.  He played the priest. 
[01:09:00]  I think so.  Of course he did.  Let's move along, guys.  Your trivia stinks.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  More callers just loving you.  Loving you, Marge.  Let's have a legit call.  Yes, please.  Serious calls only for Marge.  I'm tired of this.  Yeah, let's say hi to Darren in Kings Park.  Darren.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Love the show.  Thank you.  Thank you, Darren.  Hey, Darren.  How are you doing, Marge?  Do me a favor, Marge.  Drive your head into a window because you're killing me right now. 
[01:09:30]  I want to drive my car up a cliff right now.  Well, what a nice way to start the day.  That can't be.  That is so sweet.  Thank you so much.  I'll consider it.  You know, that's not nice.  I don't know you.  Who is this?  Don't come here.  I'm hanging up the phone.  Prank caller.  Prank caller.  Yes.  Yeah, that was.  Prank caller.  It wasn't even a prank caller.  That was someone that just doesn't like you on the show there, Marge.  Let's say hi to somebody in Buffalo.  Buffalo, what's up?  Yeah, I was just calling to say somebody should hit this lady in the liver with a roller blade.  Yeah. 
[01:10:00]  With a roller blade, that would be an original idea.  You're not an animal lover there, Buffalo?  No, absolutely not.  Marge.  I'm sorry, Marge.  We just don't have animal lovers calling the program at this time.  Marge, how long do you give the little pups before you gas them over there?  Nope.  I refuse to comment about those.  So you do euthanize some of the dogs.  And is it true that a guy just comes to the back door and just piles them up into a pickup truck?  Are they as cute in the little plastic biohazard bag as they are when they're licking your hand? 
[01:10:30]  You know what?  Does it make good fertilizer?  Do you know what God spells backwards?  God spelled backwards.  Oh, wait.  I could do this.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let me get a pen.  Get me a pen.  God spelled.  Adig.  There you go.  There you go.  You know, I knew you could do it.  I'm smart.  Let's say hi to Steve. 
[01:11:00]  Hello.  Steve, where are you calling from?  Hi, I'm in Yellowstone.  Yellowstone.  Wow.  Very good.  Now, one of our national parks, Marge.  You know Yellowstone is full of animals.  Yes.  It's a national refuge.  Yes, yes.  It's a wonderful place.  So, Steve, I would bet Steve is very sympathetic to the cause of animals.  I still hope so.  And he sounds very feminine, so I'm sure he has a lot of pets.  Very sensitive.  Probably a lot of cats.  Right.  Put him on.  Steve, you're on. 
[01:11:30]  All right.  You asked for it.  I'm sorry.  That was terrible.  Hi, Marge.  I really support what you're doing because I think that living out here where I live,  a lot of the animals are mistreated, and I think that a lot of people just come to the  park because they want to come and see the animals.  A lot of times they think they're mistreated by people, but I like the fact that you're  sticking up for them.  Well, thank you so much.  You're on our side.  I appreciate it.  Ramone!  Marge fell backwards in an irrelevant old bag of meat. 
[01:12:00]  Ramone!  Marge eats more cat food than her animals.  Ramone!  Ramone!  You've been ages to be committed with work boots!  Gentlemen!  Ramone!  Marge should pick up a little doggie and apply some pink lipstick!  Gentlemen, bring this court to order.  My God!  Order in the court!  Marge, once again, I have to profusely apologize.  I have to tell me, with your zillions, zillions of listening air audiences, that you can't 
[01:12:30]  find one person that can speak kindly and nicely about little animals.  Marge, I, again, I am profusely apologizing.  I don't understand why our audience feels the need to do this when it is such a good cause.  The little shelter, they really do take, I don't know, they take these, do you take  strays in?  Well, we do everything.  I'm not here to tell what we do. 
[01:13:00]  Do you guys, like, have fun at the shelter and have timers on all the cages, counting down  to their death?  Do you save a cuter one a little longer than you do the ugly dogs?  Opie!  Do you mock the ones that just don't look quite right, knowing they're going to die,  because everyone wants the cute pets first?  Opie!  Do you play the Green Mile every so often?  Opie!  Anthony!  Opie! 
[01:13:30]  Yes, yes, Marge, I'm here.  You guys come to work as the Grim Reaper around Halloween.  Alright, listen, I'm going to try one more time.  Okay.  Are you ready?  Marge, I am ready.  And then you can cut me off.  I want to hear your message, Marge.  I would like the two of you to appear in an ad, a public service announcement, that  we can use for newspapers and magazines so that people know that you guys support the  work of Little Shelter.  Ah, so we would then be in print ads and such? 
[01:14:00]  You know who did it for us?  Howie's girlfriend.  Sir Elton John.  Sir Elton John?  Yes, yes.  Did you put to sleep that thing on his head?  Yeah.  Did you euthanize his wig?  A lot of other, you know, I hate to name drop.  Dave, please, name drop.  I want to hear.  If Sir Elton John did it, the ad is running.  We would love you to do it.  What do you say?  I say no. 
[01:14:30]  How much money you got for me to appear in this ad?  We don't have any.  Does that mean you have to be?  And I don't want a free doggy or a free kitten for doing this.  And you're not getting, you know what you'll get.  Let's talk cash, Marge.  Cash talks.  Cold, hard cash.  Cold, hard cash.  How much money are you willing to give me to appear in a charity ad?  There is no money involved.  It's all from the kindness of your heart.  Marge, do they look up at you with those little eyes before you shut the door of the chamber? 
[01:15:00]  Oh, God help me.  What I do for little shelter.  You know what I would do for little shelter?  I would be your executioner.  So no one else has to do it.  Hey, okay.  How about this, Marge?  Me and Opie come in, and instead of the print ad supporting it, we euthanize the animals for a day.  You know how they have celebrity bartenders?  Right.  We'll be your celebrity executioners.  We'll kill the puppies and kittens.  Would you do that?  Yeah, we'll come in, and for a day, we'll kill all the puppies and kittens that you need killed that day. 
[01:15:30]  So everyone that works there could get a good night's sleep.  Yeah, the executioner could take the day off.  You know what?  Yes?  Please tell me something nice before we...  I think that's a very nice offer.  How much does the dog killer make?  We don't have dog killers.  We are a no-kill shelter.  Yeah, that's the official word, right?  You go out back at a little shelter.  Maybe there's a few lumps of dirt that weren't there the night before.  How many times do you have to lie when someone comes in and goes, 
[01:16:00]  Hey, what happened to Fluffy?  Oh, Fluffy was adopted Tuesday.  Fluffy's dead in the back of a pickup truck out back.  We sound in the country.  Let's say hi to...  Guys, just a second.  Look, we're really pissing off a lot of people.  We got Sam from Mulatto Town down there in Mississippi.  Sam's very supportive, Marge.  Hold on.  Let's talk to Sam from Mulatto Town.  Sam, this isn't a prank call, right?  No, this is not a prank call.  All right. 
[01:16:30]  Marge, you're talking to Sam from Mulatto Town.  Now, we've talked to Sam before, so I know this is him.  Sam, why are you guys doing this to her?  She's volunteering her time.  I agree.  God bless you, Sam.  There's no reason.  I volunteer at the local animal shelter down here.  We have some black and white kittens, some from two different parents,  and nobody likes them because their feet are splayed out,  and I always take care of them.  That's very sweet.  Sam, you know, years ago, there was a song that said, 
[01:17:00]  Sam, you made the pants too long.  Did you ever hear that, Sam?  Oh, I can't.  Wee-wee-pan for a hat.  Ramone, bring me an acting lesson.  Ramone, Marge should be smothered by a male nurse.  Ramone, make a funny sound when you snap the little legs backwards. 
[01:17:30]  Ramone, Marge should grab her chest and fall face-first into a litter box.  Oh, my goodness.  This sweet little old lady.  She hung up.  All right.  She couldn't take any more from Sam from Mulatto Town.  Down there in Mississippi. 
[01:18:00]  Mississippi, Mississippi, we had Steve from Yellowstone, who I love.  Ah, we're really late, so.  Oh, wow.  Poor Marge.  She just doesn't get it.  No.  We have to take a break.  We have five IMAX to give away.  We're going to do that next, and we'll talk about what just happened.  How's that?  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Opie, Anthony, Dance Party Weekend.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Na, na, na.  Na, na.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:18:30]  Comedy gone too far.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, wait.  Marge's daughter's on the line.  Is that really?  Marge's daughter.  Hello, Marge's daughter.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello? 
[01:19:00]  Hello, hello.  Oh.  Similar voice.  What's up?  Yes.  Don't I sound exactly like Marge?  You kind of do.  Yes.  Exactly.  Now, who am I speaking to?  This is CBS Management.  This is CBS Management.  Okay.  What's up?  What's up?  I'm calling to defend this wonderful woman.  How dare you? 
[01:19:30]  How could you, how could you, why would you even have to defend a wonderful woman like Marge?  I think her goodness comes through.  I think when she talks about how much she cares about these animals, people instinctively know that there is good in her.  I don't think any explanations necessary.  She is a wonderful, wonderful woman.  God bless Marge.  She is wonderful.  God bless is correct, but I think you should put your money where your mouth is. 
[01:20:00]  Hey, from your lips to God's ears.  Absolutely.  What do you need?  What do you need?  10 spot.  Yeah, what do you need?  What do you need?  What do you need?  10 spot, 20?  No, what she needs is.  Wow, you sound just like Marge, I swear.  Wait a second.  Give me a break.  Wait, who are you?  Miss, who are you?  I just, I just got back.  I was out of studio.  Who are you?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Forgive my interruption.  James.  I'm Marge's daughter.  Are you really?  What's your name?  June.  June.  It's a nice, lovely name. 
[01:20:30]  Marge has two wonderful daughters.  Uh-huh.  Are you her oldest or her youngest?  I am the oldest.  God bless.  How old a gal are you?  Get out of here.  That's not polite to ask a woman her age, James.  Why not?  I'm 51 years young.  Do you know 70 is the new 60?  Did I say that right?  I don't know.  Okay, I don't care what the new thing is.  The bottom line is this.  You got 30 seconds.  Go.  He needs you to help her out. 
[01:21:00]  I think it's important what you're doing.  Huh?  I think it's important what she's doing.  Got to cut our losses.  It's going nowhere.  We got IMAX to give away.  Much more important stuff than saving dogs and cats.  Something tells me June is not going to be happy with the way she was dealt with.  I know.  She could call back another day when we have a lot more time to mess with her.  We got to give away IMAX.  Met Ramon at some point.  Well, Houston was about to.  We have five IMAX to give away.  We got hundreds and hundreds of entries. 
[01:21:30]  Yes.  For the IMAX.  Hundreds and hundreds of entries.  Most of them sucked.  Yeah.  We're going to play the top ten.  It'll go by fast.  Of course, ten through six get nothing.  I like when you have to preface a bit like surgery.  Don't worry.  It'll go quickly.  You'll be asleep.  You won't even feel it.  Well, come on.  I mean, you heard the entries.  Well, a couple of them, but pretty good.  Some aren't bad.  Some of them pretty bad. 
[01:22:00]  But this for an IMAX.  Right.  This is big stuff.  Well, coming in 10th place out of hundreds of entries for the IMAX, it's Hardcore Radio from Bill L.  Bill L, you do not win an IMAX for this.  He misses out.  Opie and Anthony.  Hardcore Radio.  Oh, smoothies in here.  I want a smoothie, but I want pineapple shrubbery. 
[01:22:30]  I like blueberry.  I like soft fruit.  Were you in a beauty parlor two weeks ago?  What do you need, Dolphus?  Do you like looking at me?  Yeah.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Spread the virus.  I got my back wax yesterday.  What the hell is wrong with you?  All right.  Hey, that should have won an IMAX.  That's kind of really funny.  It starts off all ballsy and everything and hardcore like your typical, you know, a too cool for the room guys. 
[01:23:00]  And then it has us talking about what we talk about.  Smoothies and fruit.  And getting our back waxed.  What a room full of faggots.  Yeah.  Oh, well, sorry, Bill.  The judges have determined, no.  No.  You don't get an IMAX.  All right.  Coming in ninth place.  Boy, I'll tell you one thing.  What?  The rest of these better suck or it better be better than his was. 
[01:23:30]  Right.  If one of these suck more than his, you guys are going to look bad.  It's all about the top five because they all win the IMAX.  So in ninth place, it was Grizzly Man 2.  What does Grizzly Man 2 mean?  Well, the movie Grizzly Man.  Grizzly Man 1.  It's the sequel.  Grizzly Man 2 from Zach.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  I thought his name was.  Never mind.  All right.  Grizzly Man 2, the sequel to Grizzly Man.  I get it.  From Zach K.  This was his entry in trying to win an IMAX. 
[01:24:00]  Oh, he's a big bear.  A very big bear.  What are you doing in my house?  He's rowdy.  He's getting bigger.  He's getting to be a big boy.  Get the flip out now.  That was a challenge, and you have to remain cool in the challenge.  If you don't, you're dead.  Grr, grr.  I'm proving myself as being able to hold my ground and therefore earning the respect.  I'm sorry.  You just relax.  Oh, God.  Oh, I love you.  I love you. 
[01:24:30]  Lebanese homo.  Wow, wow.  All right.  See, I'd have put him in 10th place.  And Hardcore Radio would have been in ninth so far.  Yeah.  Let's see how far down Hardcore Radio makes it.  Yeah, that'll be interesting.  Because he is now ninth place in my book.  That's right.  In eighth place, meaning this person did not win one of the IMAX.  No, sorry.  O&A present Frank the Frowner from Jeff S.  Eight place out of hundreds of entries. 
[01:25:00]  I frown a lot.  My name's Frank.  O&A pictures present the story of a boy and a special ailment.  When I try to smile, I strain so hard, my shoulders lift up.  Ridiculed all his life for something he cannot control.  When I was in school, they would call me, I'm fly down banana face.  Watch a man not to cope with his frown.  You know, I take some more muscles to frown if there's a smile they told me.  I just want to smile.  Just once.  Will he ever smile?  Or smirk? 
[01:25:30]  Okay, that wasn't bad because it's got Frank the Frowner in it.  Right.  But not as creative as Hardcore Radio.  His Hardcore Radio has now made it on my list to number seven.  Or number eight.  Right.  But that wasn't bad, right?  Not bad.  Not bad.  All right, the IMAX entry is the top ten here.  The top five will win IMAX in seventh place, according to the boys. 
[01:26:00]  It's on a children's radio hour from Matt V.  Sounds cute.  Falling short, Matt V.  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Opie and Anthony children's radio hour.  Mommy took thalidomide.  Boy, this dumpster is smelly.  Who the hell saw that coming?  There's a why did my mommy kill me song?  It's being sucked out and a band plays on.  I hear the sound of a vacuum cleaner.  Mommy must be cleaning the rug.  Wait a minute.  It's headed this away.  So tune in, kids, from six to nine on 3FM and then from nine to 11 on XM Satellite Radio. 
[01:26:30]  And who knows?  Maybe you could be the topic of an Amber Alert someday, too.  What do you think?  Hardcore radio is moving down the list.  He is going to be pissed when he doesn't win an IMAX.  Yeah, he can't get one.  I mean, you know, the judging is final.  But my personal opinion, although I like that one, it was very edgy. 
[01:27:00]  All right, in sixth place, falling just short of winning an IMAX.  Oh, just missed here.  Just missed.  It's what I learned from Uncle Ant from RPI.  Opie and Anthony are back.  Vincent's going to tell us what he learned this summer.  I spent three weeks with my Uncle Anthony, and I learned a lot from listening to his radio program.  First of all, women on the radio stink on ice, and all holes should be banned from the airwaves. 
[01:27:30]  Next, it's good to live amongst the Jews.  They have all the money, so they have nice houses, and the crime rates are low.  Opie's name is first because he saved my uncle from blue-collar hell.  Jimmy is a good egg, but I'm not allowed to be alone with him.  All right, that's funny.  Are we going to use some of these as promos?  Oh, very good.  That is funny.  Some of you guys will be played over and over again on our show.  So, unfortunately, RPI just missed.  Boy, these top five had better be good. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, man, these guys are panicking.  Oh.  Yeah, Danny and Than freaking in the corner.  Yeah.  Freaking out.  And Steve loving it.  Loving it.  So happy.  Let me write the line.  Let me write the line.  I'm sure Danny's hungover and everything, too.  These guys took this contest very seriously, and one of the judges is still drunk since the fourth.  All right. 
[01:28:30]  All right.  There it is.  Now the rest of these people will win IMAX.  Will win IMAX.  The first winner of an IMAX is Charles G.  What?  This one?  You don't have any confidence, Danny.  Well, it's simply...  I can see it.  I think...  What's the problem?  No, there's no problem at all.  None?  I'm just waiting for the reaction.  That's all.  From this one in particular? 
[01:29:00]  It's really obnoxious.  Yeah, it's titled Most Obnoxious 30 Seconds Ever.  Ever.  From Charles G.  But it was good enough to win an IMAX?  We all thought so yesterday.  Just edged out what I learned from Uncle Anthony, which I thought was adorably cute and very  accurate.  What, Dan?  You want in on this?  No, just we were listening to these and Sam brought up a great point.  Yeah.  That when you hear this one, that's one of the winners, and you're one of the other guys,  you might be a little upset.  Oh, you're going to be really, really mad? 
[01:29:30]  It just...  Yeah, it just...  It worked for us.  Oh, boy.  All right, here we go.  All the judges' decision is final.  Yes.  So, you know, regardless.  Right.  It's all a matter of taste and...  Oh, boy.  So, this person, Charles G., wins an IMAX for this.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[01:30:00]  I like Boonberry.  That's not too annoying at all.  Opie and Anthony.  Oh, my God.  Oh.  All right.  You know what?  Bulletproof vests for the staff?  What? 
[01:30:30]  I like it.  I kind of like it, too.  I like it a lot.  I don't think Jimmy has done that on the FM radio portion of the show.  On this side of the Opie and Anthony show.  But Jimmy does something where he tests his microphone every so often.  Yeah.  And, Jimmy, maybe you could test a mic.  I...  Here's Jimmy testing a mic.  Oh!  Oh!  Yes.  And to hear a whole flock of them. 
[01:31:00]  Or is it a gaggle?  I don't know what to call that.  And then how it's slowly built.  And the reviews are coming in.  Yes, that is a winner.  That was hilarious.  Very funny.  I do think there are five people that aren't going to think it's funny.  Right.  But, yeah.  And, Steve, you're going to be making these into promos?  Yeah.  You'll make them into polished promos for us?  Yeah.  Some of the...  Yeah, because I want to hear that from time to time on our show when we go to break.  That was good.  Absolutely.  The flock of... 
[01:31:30]  Charles G., congratulations.  Congrats.  You win an iMac, my friend.  That's right.  I'm looking forward to, now that he has an iMac, more of his work...  That's right.  ...coming in.  Hoo-hoo, Higgy.  I love the most annoying 30 seconds.  Yeah, I love the name of it, too.  Most obnoxious 30 seconds ever.  And then Tony from his Subaru.  How could this awful promo not win?  Winner!  Yeah.  The boys did good.  They did good on that one.  So that came in fifth place. 
[01:32:00]  All right.  The next person also wins an iMac.  We know this guy.  I believe it's the Steven S. that we all know.  From Bayshore.  From Bayshore, right?  Yes.  Oh, wow.  Steve from Bayshore.  He's a faithful listener of the program.  He also wins an iMac for Chateau Cumia at 2 a.m.  All right.  What track is that, by the way?  All right.  I got it.  So, uh...  Steven S. wins an iMac for this.  2 a.m. at Chateau Cumia. 
[01:32:30]  Honey?  Oh, God.  He's out of bed.  And he took his friggin' uniform with him.  Oh, God.  Anthony, what are you doing?  I don't know.  Help me.  Help me.  We'll be an Anthony shot. 
[01:33:00]  Hardcore radio.  Yeah.  Should have won.  I'm not feeling Steve's, uh, bit.  We're not feeling that one.  Enjoy your iMac, Steve.  By the way, it has a great feature that can make a guy's voice sound like a girl's.  Use it.  Use it.  It's a fantastic feature in the audio, one of the audio programs.  Doug from Salt Lake, the Norton Tabernacle Choir. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah.  Well, uh, yeah, Steven S., you lucked out today, my friend.  All right.  Um, this next person came in third place, according to the judges, and he also wins an iMac.  It's Carl H., for this, which is titled, The Meaty Breasted Nothing.  Okay.  If I appear in awe, ladies and gentlemen, it is because I am staring at one of my favorite specimens,  the meaty-breasted nothing. 
[01:34:00]  If you listen closely, you just might hear his beautiful musical warboleth.  All right.  Bravo.  Carl H., very good. 
[01:34:30]  Got yourself an iMac.  Yeah.  That's funny.  Warble.  Warble.  Warble.  By the way, the most obnoxious 30 seconds ever, a lot of people want that as a ringtone.  Maybe we should throw that up on OpieAndAnthony.com.  Yeah.  OpieAndAnthony.com.  There it is, people.  What website?  OpieAndAnthony.com.  Yes, you heard it here.  We'll have that up there as a ringtone.  That's very funny.  All right.  So, uh, yes, Carl H., congratulations.  You won an iMac as well, like Anthony just said. 
[01:35:00]  A lot of people want to know if you're living with a man, by the way, Anthony.  I know.  The guy could have at least done this.  Why does Anthony live with a man?  And the loser doesn't even know a chick that could play Ant's girl part.  That's Mr. Torrance.  And it was the same.  My voice was the same as hers.  It wasn't even like he put on a different voice.  All right.  Here we go.  Is this Steve?  The runner-up in the iMac, uh... 
[01:35:30]  Not you, Steve.  ...contest.  You're an angel.  Because this is just so exciting.  Of course it is.  This person is no stranger to the Opie and Anthony show.  Mm-hmm.  And he will be winning an iMac.  Yes, Chemistry, you won an iMac.  Yes.  We know him very well.  Uh, here's his entry called ONA Song.  Chemistry, everyone.  Opie, the millionaire.  Anthony, germaphobe.  Jim Norton, pedophile.  Ben is only sniffing coke. 
[01:36:00]  Steve is just a big bear.  E-Rod likes to flow.  The fan is fantastic.  Travis sits in answers phone.  Sandy drank a few beers.  Could be more than that, gentlemen.  Matter of fact, I could kill you with my hat.  Kenny's big or stupid.  Here we go again.  ONA virus spreading on free FM.  All right.  A little ditty from Chemistry.  Not a lot of production, really.  A track and some singing, right?  A track and some singing. 
[01:36:30]  Isn't that what, like, the long and winding road is?  Yeah.  Yesterday?  Yeah, I guess.  Very nice, Chemistry.  The runner-up of the iMac contest.  And finally, this person will also win an iMac and the last iMac.  Yes, here it is.  Goes to our buddy, our pal, who does a lot for this show and doesn't get paid.  It's Drew Boogie. 
[01:37:00]  He won the entire contest with, is it...  I know I speak like an idiot.  Do you?  It's all about me.  Is it?  I...  I was assaulted.  Were you?  We're brilliant broadcasters.  Are we?  You are out of your mind.  Am I?  That sounds real good.  Does it?  I'm thrilled.  I'm excited.  Am I?  I thought I heard Negro.  Did you?  Is it? 
[01:37:30]  That's not bad.  Drew Boogie.  That's good.  Wins the iMac contest.  Congratulations.  And a fine iMac.  Yes.  They all won the new iMac.  It has everything you need and more to explore all your creative possibilities.  Don't forget, they just came out with the MacBook, a tiny laptop that does everything  that the iMac does, built-in camera and everything.  Check it out at apple.com.  I demand Steve redo his bit on the iMac and use that woman voice thing because that had 
[01:38:00]  potential.  Right.  But the same voice, it's going to annoy me now all night.  I'm just going to think of how you screwed that up.  It's too bad.  Yet still won an iMac.  It's too bad we didn't have more time for the contest.  Yeah.  Because it was starting to go somewhere.  See, there's probably a lot of people out there going, I could have beat that.  Yeah.  You didn't send it in.  Did you?  Did you?  All right.  Going to break. 
[01:38:30]  Everyone is requesting the most obnoxious 30 seconds ever.  Wow.  It's a hit already.  Yeah.  It's definitely, definitely good.  I think it should have came in second place, actually.  All right.  As we go to break, so you can record this and make it into a ringtone, it's the most obnoxious  30 seconds ever from Charles G.  Hopi and Anthony are back.  What the F? 
[01:39:00]  That wasn't it, Hopi.  That wasn't it.  I'm sorry.  This should be it.  God, I had the good out and everything.  I know.  Pro.  Here it is.  That's not too annoying at all. 
[01:39:30]  Opi and Anthony.  Responsible parents everywhere, Opi and Anthony are now back on the regular airwaves.  So take your baby off that windowsill and sit him in front of the radio.  To hear the shriek of a small child, that would be wonderful.  Opi and Anthony Dash, bring in the funny.  Bring in the funny. 
[01:40:00]  Hear what everybody else is talking about.  O&A, uncut and live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio, starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  The Opi and Anthony Show.  Want to say hi to Ralph from Belleville? 
[01:40:30]  Used to be a big Howard fan.  You've turned him around.  Thank you, Ralph.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  It's the Opi and Anthony Show.  The O&A virus spreading across America.  Heading toward the weekend.  Oh, we got Joel?  Joel McHale, yeah.  From The Soup.  Pop him up.  What's up, Joel? 
[01:41:00]  What's up?  Sorry to make your way through, I don't know, nine minutes of commercials or something like that.  No, it's great to hear about your comedy tour and not to speed in New York.  I will not speed when I'm there.  I gotta tell you, I used to be a big fan of Talk Soup back in the day.  Yeah.  And then Greg Kinnear went away, and then there was a few other people in there that kind of got the job done.  And then for many years, I just said, I'm done with Talk Soup.  And then I took a peek, I don't know, maybe, how long have you been doing it?  About a year now? 
[01:41:30]  Well, on the book, about two years.  Oh, wow.  See how long it took to get me back on board?  I've been a Joel McHale fan of The Soup for the whole time.  The whole time?  Yep.  I started noticing about a year ago, and I'm like, man, this guy is hilarious.  And I watched The Soup, I DVR'd every weekend now.  Yeah, I think he started noticing about a year ago, too, so it worked out.  He's more of the sarcastic bastard than the smarmy guy.  Thank you.  Which I like, yeah.  I'd rather be sarcastic than smarmy. 
[01:42:00]  It kind of works.  It's got to be weird stepping into that.  It's almost like, even though you have the support crew and everything, and some of those  people are even known, it is almost like an SNL thing, where some people go, yeah, that  wasn't a good year, or that wasn't a good season, and then you step in and wonder if it's going  to work out for you.  Any reservations?  No, I mean, it was one of those things where I got the opportunity to do it, and I thought,  well, if nobody sees it, that'll be fine, because it's going to be low on the radar at 
[01:42:30]  first.  So I didn't lose a lot there, but as the show kind of has started to, it's moving like a  glacier towards popularity.  And as we're slowly but surely melting down some people, now it's like, okay, now I feel  like I can finally do it, as opposed to like, you know, like Silent Live, where they throw  a whole bunch of new people out there, and they go, don't screw it up!  Yeah, right.  And so I feel like, you know, I've been able to slowly come along and get out all the problems. 
[01:43:00]  That just sucks when you have a TV show offered to you, that you take and think, I hope my  friends don't see this, unless it gets popular.  It's not like an, you know, you don't know if it's going to be a hit or something.  XFL game day.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Big, huge stars who have done these pilots, and they were like, I don't know, it was me  and a pink dragon, and I thought it was going to be funny.  Yes, it had to work. 
[01:43:30]  It sounded like a good idea at the time.  I guess what would be worse is if you get on a show that you're not proud of, but then  it still becomes popular.  Yeah, true.  And then you're not proud of it, yet you're taking the check, and do your friends still  think you're an ass, though?  Oh, yeah.  Well, they thought that the whole time.  Yeah.  So does my wife.  But I feel like I'm actually doing a service, and I'm providing fire for the natives a little  bit, sometimes just because I don't think there's enough people saying that television 
[01:44:00]  is necessarily bad.  You know what the thing is, no one has enough time or effort, you can't take the effort  to watch all the crap that is on now.  No.  So you guys boil it down, hence the soup.  Yeah.  Boil it down to a viewable half hour.  A palatable, it's like a tasting menu of crap.  It's only the good stuff.  Why should I sit through an entire hour or sometimes two-hour reality show when only 
[01:44:30]  one good thing happens that I know I'm going to be able to watch you guys goof on?  The way it's the medium of Big Brother for an hour to listen to people whispering each  other and going like, hey, are you going to guard me in the next meeting?  Yeah, exactly.  Just, oh, it makes me think.  Everyone says that America's attention spans are getting shorter, but I'm like, have you  seen that?  People are just whispering for an hour.  I tried to watch Big Brother All-Stars last night, matter of fact.  I couldn't get through it.  I already gave up on the show. 
[01:45:00]  And we try to watch a lot of this stuff, so we could also goof on it, Joel, but I'm out  as far as Big Brother goes.  I can't sit through that crap.  I know.  We thank God for the interns and the production assistants who say they've got about five or six  hours of television on their TiVos.  Oh my God, you're so right, because we got a staff here, and we're like, hey, watch Tyra.  She's going to do something stupid, and we can goof on it, and we don't have to sit through  all the nonsense.  Tyra is pretty much a guarantee that she's going to do something stupid, and completely 
[01:45:30]  Tyra.  It's got to be about her.  Yeah, she doesn't like us very much.  Too bad.  She's had everyone her entire life just telling her how great she is, and she doesn't realize  she's just that dope.  Yeah.  Well, you put yourself out there the way she does five days a week.  What do we know?  Yeah.  And when she goes and does a show about a fear, and her greatest fear in life is dolphins.  Oh, what did we go off on that one?  Yeah, a lot of people can relate to that.  Yeah, right.  I'm driving down the interstate, man. 
[01:46:00]  Just these dolphins keep flashing before my eyes.  I had to pull over.  It's going to be the dumbest fear ever.  Yeah, and is it really a fear if you can avoid it?  Yeah, exactly.  There are places you can go where you will guarantee you will never, ever see a dolphin.  Exactly.  You can't be afraid of it.  I fear forest fires.  Well, that's good.  You live in Alaska, so it's perfect.  You're in the snow.  It won't happen.  She should be afraid of up-close photos of that stupid mustache she has.  Yeah.  You're mighty with facial hair on her.  I don't have fear of wigs.  Maybe. 
[01:46:30]  Right.  You must have made quite a few enemies, though.  It's kind of a job that you take knowing that you're not going to be the most popular guy in those circles.  Yeah, I mean, I assume that, and when people scream at me, I hope it's accolades.  But sometimes we'll, like I sat on a bus with Drew Lachey on a, oh, that's a long story,  but I sat on, and we had made fun of Nick Lachey a lot, and he, thank God, was like,  oh, yeah, he watches the show to repeat the jokes back to his brother, which was great. 
[01:47:00]  That's cool, yeah.  So when I hear stuff like that, it makes me very happy, and hopefully, unless we really  want to take a shot at somebody, it's their stupid behavior.  Like, Hasselhoff, I mean, what do you expect us to do?  When he was crying on the finale of American Idol, it was gold.  I rewound that about eight times just to confirm, am I seeing David Hasselhoff crying at American Idol?  Yeah, he was like, did I just see, am I in the same reality? 
[01:47:30]  Am I in the same dimension everyone else is in?  I thought they had cut to some other show, like a sci-fi movie or something, like completely  different.  And by the way, you do cover not only the talk shows, which the old talk soup used to do,  but when you play some of these sci-fi movie clips from the sci-fi channel, they're exclusive  movies.  Lou Diamond Phillips has just become the star of these things. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  He is what Marky Post used to be the Lifetime movies.  That is, you are absolutely, he's a Shannon Tweed.  Right, exactly.  And they are such bad movies.  Sci-fi spits those things out.  They shoot them, I think they shoot them all in Bulgaria.  I'm not kidding.  And the budget's just got to be so low.  And then they have a series like Battlestar Galactica, one of the best series on TV, but  they get these movies and they must find these guys right out of high school and be like,  all right, here's 90 grand. 
[01:48:30]  You got two weeks, here's a camera.  Yeah, they're using like an old Pong machine for the CGI.  Yeah, if you don't have something in the can in two weeks, you're not coming back from  Bulgaria.  That's basically awful stuff.  Yeah, but they must be watching them.  And when Coolio is in your movie, you got a reel.  You know, that's going to be a good one.  Yeah, you're in trouble.  Yeah, you guys definitely expanded, though, which is cool.  You know, it's not just the talk shows.  Yeah.  You throw in the Spanish programming I find very funny.  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[01:49:00]  We have a great show on tonight called Infarto.  I'm not kidding.  It's spelled I-N-F-A-R-T-O.  And they take Punk'd to a new level where they pretend your loved one has been killed.  And your loved one is in on the joke, too.  That's the best part.  And they show people hyperventilating.  I mean, it's not just like, hey, man, we switched your car.  Isn't that funny?  And they're like, no, dude, your mom is dying.  She's bleeding out.  Wow.  I mean, I was like, that is a show. 
[01:49:30]  God damn.  Why aren't we doing that?  Yeah, the Mexicans and the Japanese seem to really have that wrapped up where they really  don't care.  I guess they don't have lawyers in those countries.  No, and speaking of Japan, we have a little Japanese film about teaching kids how to poop.  Really?  That's on tonight.  A Japanese film, so it's going to be adorable.  Yeah, it's a cartoon, and then it really shows a kid straining.  And then I was like, I think I just became a pedophile.  I didn't even choose to. 
[01:50:00]  I don't know what just happened.  The Gary Glitter show.  What are you guys working on for this weekend's installment?  Well, somehow, and I don't know how she keeps doing it, Star is still around.  Yeah.  And she's saying stuff like, I wanted to get in out the open, so to stop the gossip.  And it's like, yeah, how'd that plan work out, Star?  Perfectly in your favor to keep the gossip going.  Yeah, what the hell was she thinking?  Although we kind of gave her props for that one, because you know how it works. 
[01:50:30]  It's the usual crap where they know they're firing you.  You know you're getting fired.  But they try to seem like it's, you know, they both want it to go their separate ways.  And she just kind of blindsided them and said, you know, no, this is it.  They are going to renew my contract.  Yeah, I'm a little disappointed, because how great would it be?  They wouldn't even need guests if it was just Rosie O'Donnell and Star Jones.  Yeah, that's what I don't understand.  That's what I don't understand.  If they want real ratings, they should have just let it happen, 
[01:51:00]  because everyone knew those two didn't get along, and that's why they chose Rosie over Star.  Yeah, let them fight it out on TV.  I would watch every day.  Oh, great.  They're like, today on the show, Jim Belushi, he just walks out and sits quietly while they just scream at him.  Well, they just bitch at each other.  You probably looked at that and went like, oh, there's gold down the drain.  Yeah, it was like, what?  I'm going to, apparently, well, so far right now, I'm still booked on The View,  but I'm going to ask them about that when I'm there.  It must be like losing a loved one when a show like Tony Danza goes off the air.  You just, I was like bringing in my uncle who died young. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, yeah.  That show was great, man.  What was the bid you guys did?  They did Danzitions.  Yeah, the Danzitions was hilarious.  Danzitions.  He was so bad at that monologue that he would just talk about something, an awful thoughts and prayers going out to the families of all the dead people.  It was a horrible fire this weekend.  And my daughter graduated from high school.  I want to applaud the Danzitions.  Hey, how about those Mets? 
[01:52:00]  But seriously, cancer's horrible.  Yeah, right.  He's awful.  We are so, I got to go.  I thank God he, but he didn't try to swing at me when I.  No, I saw that.  He was so nice.  And we were, we were literally, we were sad and wanting to hug him when he left.  We, we, oh, he would.  Joel, it took a good, like a champ.  It took a great bit away from us, too, because Anthony does it dead on Tony Danza.  Oh, really?  Well, I, I heard a little bit of it there.  Oh, we used to do, we used to do the phone call.  We used to have one of our guys go online as these people were going in to see Tony Danza and say that Tony Danza wants to talk to somebody to get him backstage before the show. 
[01:52:30]  Right.  And you know, the audiences that, that they get over there, they actually thought these Midwest people that it was Tony Danza on the phone.  And it would slowly go into them coming backstage to service me.  You're going to need to take your pants off.  I'm going to twitch my nose.  And they believed it right to the end.  They didn't, they didn't want to think that they weren't talking to their hero, Tony Danza. 
[01:53:00]  And Tony would just get filthier and filthier and want to like flip him over.  It was really bad.  Tony was gold, man.  Did you hear that, uh, Brittany and, uh, Kevin are, are talking about doing another season of Chaotic, their reality show?  Oh, thank God.  Ah, we heard that and it was, ah.  It was party time at the office.  Yeah, we, we cracked open the champagne and, uh, yeah, we, uh, we could not be more happy. 
[01:53:30]  Hey, I saw some of, uh, uh, or at least one.  What's the guy's name, uh, from the old crew?  Uh, Tom.  Tom, Tom, yeah, Tom's come back.  Yeah, Tom has been, well, Tom never, Tom never left.  He never left, but he was kind of taken off of, uh, any on-air duties.  Yeah, they kind of, it depends on which, you know, uh, which, uh, which, which monarchy is in there.  And they, for a while, like, Tom couldn't be on.  And then Tom was like, well, we need Tom every show.  Tom should be next to you.  And then, uh, and then, uh, so now we try to get him into the show as much as we can. 
[01:54:00]  He was, he was there before Kinnear and he started with Kinnear and I looked at that guy, I did a best of talk soup.  Yeah, I saw that.  Yep.  And his reel was incredible.  And some of the comedy is, is awesome.  So it's great to have him because he knows, that he knows what works in that kind of strange format of just a person and a camera.  So he's like the guy.  You would think Greg Kinnear would, you know, put him in a movie by now.  Yeah, help a guy out.  Help a guy out a little bit.  How about me? 
[01:54:30]  You in a movie.  Hey, what is John Henson doing?  I, I, I used to like John Henson a lot too.  Yeah, he, he's a very funny guy and he hosts, uh, he hosts a show on the TV Guide channel.  Uh-oh.  His wife is a big producer and so I, I don't think he's got anything to worry about.  Oh, okay.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, he, yeah, he did, and he was, yeah, he, he really was put into a tough spot when he took over for Kinnear.  Yeah, because Kinnear really had like what made the show work, yeah.  Yeah, and so to step into that was hard. 
[01:55:00]  And, and then eventually they had Aisha Tyler who clearly is still the most attractive out of all of them.  Yeah, wow.  And then, uh, another show that went away that we used to have fun with was, uh, Paradise.  Oh, what a stroke of genius it was for E to have them on.  Why didn't they, like, I don't understand.  I don't understand why they didn't continue with that show.  It was such a, we love Trainwreck TV over here.  Well, E, I, hey, we, we live for Trainwreck TV and then when, when it was on E's dime,  they're like, we've got to get rid of this. 
[01:55:30]  This is, Brooke Burke was a genius and, uh, who was the, uh, first host of Wild On.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then I like how Tyra, I mean, uh, Tara, after the series was over was like, uh, I think  this show has hurt my image.  Her image, that image that she had.  A, your image was already way shot and B, you signed the paper and flew to Europe.  The best part, the best observation about Tara is she never did anything.  No.  She was in these exotic places where they want you to go, like, uh, I don't know, parasailing. 
[01:56:00]  And it was like, oh my God, we're in Spain, guys, and we're going to go parasailing.  It's going to be so much fun.  It's going to be, we're on the beach, I'm going to parasail.  And then when we get time to parasail, she goes, what are you crazy?  I'm not going up in the air.  What are you going to do?  But, like, look how cool it looks.  Give me another cigarette.  Yeah, we'll be right back.  She ought to thank God.  There's a lot of types of rum here in Portugal.  Yeah, more drinking.  Right.  She ought to thank Natasha Lyonne, because, like, she's not the biggest screw-up from the  American Pie movies.  Oh, yeah.  Just because of Natasha Lyonne.  Yeah, it totally helped. 
[01:56:30]  I wish that if they would just bring back Paradise, and now we've got Nicole and Paris,  and we have all these stars that have, I've had shows or movies at one point, now they've  got series, and thank God they're letting me make fun.  Yeah, it's just never-ending.  The supply is amazing that you guys have over there.  It's a very entertaining show.  You guys going after Tom Cruise this weekend?  Did he do something?  Well, a lot of people are wondering where the kid is.  Speculation that there is no baby, because there's been no real pictures. 
[01:57:00]  I like how, well, last week it was like, yeah, we're not showing him until we get the  right price.  Yeah.  Which is, and after Angelina Jolie's baby and all that, and they're like, yeah, we got  kind of a crappy baby, but we're just going to wait.  We think they had a waterhead.  Oh, Jesus.  A waterhead.  We think they had a waterhead, and it's, oh boy, what are we going to do now?  What's his big catchphrase after you show his video montage?  Much love.  Much love. 
[01:57:30]  That was when he was accepting an award for Jamie Foxx.  What a tool.  Yeah, that was, we loved Tom.  We could not touch that guy two years ago.  I mean, nobody could, you couldn't, I mean, no one in media could do it, and then all of  a sudden.  No, then it was fair game.  I mean, you had the Scientology SS would come after you, and now it's like, you know, fair  game, anybody.  It's open season, man, and he, it's, that whole run was, not that it's huge, but it's just incredible 
[01:58:00]  to watch the whole thing kind of unfold.  I think what happens is once you hook up with a Hollywood chick, all bets are off.  It happened with everybody.  Once he became Tomcat, it was over.  Well, how long has he had, like, his sister, his publicist now or something?  Didn't he change?  No, they fired her.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Fired his sister.  I think they fired her after the couch thing.  The couch incident, which was great.  That's wonderful.  Although, was it really her fault that he jumped up and down like a retard?  Yeah.  Yeah, technically, no, it's not her fault. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah, I don't think anyone, I don't think she told him to do that.  You think your sister, though, would know you well enough to know that you might do something  stupid and go, look, Tom, don't do something stupid.  Right.  You grew up with the guy, you know?  Yeah, and then she was like, wait, my brother's a billionaire, and I get how much that's mine.  Okay, perhaps then she wouldn't call him out on his stupidity.  Love to talk to you more, but we run out of show very quickly here, Joel.  The Soup.  Soup.  Friday, 10 p.m., and then...  Three times. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah, and then it's replayed over and over again.  It screws up my DVR tapings, by the way.  Yeah, it's on my DVR like 800 times.  Yeah, there's 800 The Soup on my DVR.  That warms my heart.  No, we love it, Joel, and we encourage our listeners, if they haven't yet, to definitely  take a peek.  Yes, you should definitely Tivo The Soup and MTV show Date My Mom.  Right.  I watched one episode of that.  I was horrified.  Yeah, terrifying.  I loved that.  Well, we could get into that another day. 
[01:59:30]  Give us a...  We'd love to talk to you again, Joel.  Anytime, you guys.  All right, it's Joel...  I'd love to.  All right.  Thanks, man.  It's an honor.  All right, it's Joel McHale from The Soup.  Thanks, Joel.  Bye.  Bye, you guys.  All right, there he goes.  We've got to take a quick break.  We're running out of show here.  Yes, that guy is genuinely funny on that show.  Really good.  Sarcastic.  Looks like a happy Bill Burr.  He looks like a very happy Bill Burr.  I used to get them confused before I knew Bill.  Did you?  Yeah.  You totally think it was the same guy.  Pat from Pennsylvania.  Make it fast.  We've got to take a break. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah, Opie, surprise, surprise.  I've got to call you on your use of the English language.  Yeah.  What is going online?  Don't you get in line?  Isn't it online on the internet?  I love you.  That's one of those things that you can get online.  I'm a doofus.  Stand online.  I'm a doofus, but there's a lot of people out there that say I stand in line, and others  say I stand online.  I was online yesterday, and it took an hour.  Yeah, you say online.  Because to me, there's an imaginary line, and I'm on top of it.  I say in queue.  I'm in queue. 
[02:00:30]  I mean, there's a lot of stupid lines.  I love you, guys.  All right.  Online, in line, I mean, that's not that bad.  There's a lot of people that use both of those, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, whatever.  All right.  I'm pothin' you.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Hey, you're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yep.  Okay.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Let's say hi to Joe. 
[02:01:00]  What's going up?  What's going on, Joe?  Hey, man.  Just want to let you know I really appreciate your program.  This program, and I want to let you know you've got a very diverse group of people that listen  to you, I am a faggot, so I don't care.  Are you a gay American?  Faggot!  That's right, and I don't care.  You know what?  People take themselves way too seriously, and thank you very much for what you do. 
[02:01:30]  I like that.  All right.  And you don't mind the word fag?  Well...  Which one do you mind?  I don't know.  Queer, probably?  I don't care.  Which one gets to you?  Which one where you say to yourself, ooh, that hurt?  Pickle smuggler?  Oh...  Fuck off.  Butt pirate?  Okay.  Arr.  Oh, I got it.  No, seriously.  Which one gets to you, Joe?  I think whatever one is being uttered by five guys with shaved heads leaving a bar.  I think that's the one that gets to him. 
[02:02:00]  It could be sir.  Okay, I made your point.  Fuck off.  His buddies, you know, it could be anything.  Call them sister, queen.  Well, you know, you're in the bus guard, and you're in the bus guard, and you're in the  chicken ship, and you're stuck behind, but they yell out, and they call your name.  That's pretty harsh.  All right.  I don't even know what made the air, because there was a few curses in there, I believe.  That worked.  But...  I don't care.  You know, like I said, I think people take themselves way too seriously.  All right, Joe.  We appreciate that, actually. 
[02:02:30]  Thank you.  Thanks for listening to the show.  Thank you.  Bye.  All right.  It's Joe from iFagville.  We love our gay listeners, don't we?  I like...  Oh, you like them?  I like them.  You can love them all you want.  You don't want to commit?  You can love them all you want.  I just like them.  I want to marry them, but I can't.  Not allowed.  You see the picture?  Is it in the post?  We were making fun of them.  Oh, yeah.  The old lesbian couple that they're really bummed out because, what, New York has decided  they can't get married?  What's the latest now? 
[02:03:00]  It changes every day.  I don't know.  If they didn't tell anybody, no one would have known that that wasn't a man and a man.  No, a man and a woman.  A man and a woman.  Maybe it was the Daily News.  I can't find it now, but what's the latest on that?  Do we even know?  I can't keep track anymore.  All right.  Or even what matters, state to state, because then it doesn't matter because the federal  government doesn't recognize...  Just leave them alone and get married.  Who cares?  Who cares?  What's it going to do?  Mighty.  The fact is, the president doesn't like the fags.  The president doesn't like stem cell research either. 
[02:03:30]  I've had enough of him.  The whole thing is, they don't want it, like, snowballing.  That's what they do in the privacy of their own room.  I mean the snowball effect.  Like the domino effect, the slippery slope, kind of.  And don't make a joke about that either.  There it is.  There it is.  There it is, page A5 in New York Newsday for our New York listeners.  That's a woman?  That's a woman.  Ha, Magoo, you've married again.  It's so good to look at myself 30 to 40 years from now. 
[02:04:00]  She looks like Robin Williams.  Oh, she's awful.  She really is the worst.  That could definitely be mistaken for a man.  I don't think her partner is a lesbian anymore.  No.  I think her partner officially is banging a, yeah, a man.  No, it's Chris Sarandon.  But anyway, what does it say?  Can't be wed in New York.  State's highest court reaffirms marriage as being between a man and a woman denying gay unions legitimacy.  There you go.  Because they say once men and men get married and women and women get married, then it opens 
[02:04:30]  up the doors for marrying like goats.  I don't know how that happens.  Why would you want to?  You just throw a goat out when you're finished.  That's true.  Why get married?  Goat doesn't even get married.  If it's back, it's not cleaned off when it leaves.  When you're getting the cheese for free.  You don't have to throw garbage out.  The little fella will just eat it all.  Yeah.  Just let them chew the labels off of cans. 
[02:05:00]  But then again, if someone wants to annoy you, they just have to get your pet.  Let's say hi to Katie in Jersey.  I heard and I suck.  Katie.  Goat joke.  Good morning.  Good morning, Katie.  I was just going to let you know your DVR episode there about taping all the episodes.  There is an option that you can take first run options only.  Yeah.  So you don't have a mess.  And I'll also let you know I have yet to hear a banana phone since you guys have been  on 92.3.  Oh, boy.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring. 
[02:05:30]  Banana phone.  Thanks.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Banana phone.  I've got this feeling so appealing for us to get together.  What sing?  Yeah.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Banana phone.  Ding, dong, ding, dong, ding, dong, ding.  Banana phone.  It grows in bunches.  I've got my hunches.  It's the best.  Beat the rest.  Cellular, modular, interactive, modular.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  This makes me want to take a power saw down into the subway. 
[02:06:00]  Ring, dong, ding, pong, ding.  Banana phone.  It's no baloney.  Nope.  It ain't a phony.  My cellular.  Banana phone.  And don't worry, people.  Don't worry.  That song will not stick in your head all day.  All weekend long.  It will not.  You won't be finding yourself humming this.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Banana phone.  It just comes up when you don't want it to.  It does. 
[02:06:30]  You're in the bank.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Banana phone.  You're burying a dead hooker.  La-da-da-da-da-da.  Banana phone.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Banana phone.  Oh.  It's the accent I love so much.  Yeah.  Banana phone.  It's no baloney.  We're in a weird spot here.  We don't have enough time to get into anything too crazy.  But we do have time to plug Lucky Louie on Sunday. 
[02:07:00]  Oh, yes, we do.  Grand new episode.  And we can play the most obnoxious 30 seconds ever again.  Please.  Please.  We want to play that before we end the first half of the Opie and Anthony show, before we  move it over to XM.  Also, Steve just handed in a movie trailer.  What?  When Opie met Patty.  The movie trailer.  Let's hear this.  Stalker Patty, you know, Stalker Patty is, by now, I hope, she's a real-life stalker that 
[02:07:30]  we have befriended.  Which doesn't really make her a stalker anymore, does it?  I bet this starts with Steve's dumb voice, like doing the movie guy voice.  In a small town.  In a small town.  If it starts that way, I'm taking it out and breaking it across his teeth.  Patty is a homely menopausal nuisance who's having a hard time making ends meet.  Well, my latest trouble is three weeks ago I lost my job.  I don't know if it's good or bad. 
[02:08:00]  I'm definitely a nerd.  Opie is a psychotic radio personality looking to improve his public image.  I want to be a clever talk show host.  Oh, stop.  But is easily sidetracked when the chance to exploit a waste of humanity presents itself.  You're funny, aren't you?  Well, whatever, you hold up.  We can't shave your head again.  No.  We're going to fire it up.  When charity case meets head case.  Here it comes, Patty.  A simple head shaving becomes a bloodbath. 
[02:08:30]  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  No!  No!  No!  I don't want that!  No!  I don't want that!  But we do!  Oh, crap.  Who knew getting rid of a body could be this much fun?  I think it'd be funny to whistle it through while you're digging a grave and dumping a body into it.  Holy crap.  Now that's funny.  Especially one that no one would ever miss.  What a bunch of idiots.  When Obie met Patty. 
[02:09:00]  Dude, what happened?  Yes, there seems to be a bloated body under my bed.  It's funny.  It makes no sense.  It's just kind of a trailer.  It's not really me meeting Patty.  It's when you go, what a bunch of idiots.  Why would you say that?  Why?  The rest of it makes sense to me, though.  I was running out of drops that corresponded to body death.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  But at least we have that one, so thank God. 
[02:09:30]  You're an actor.  You're an actor.  I certainly am.  Very thespian.  Chuck in Westchester.  Chuck.  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Hey.  Nothing.  I want to kill that whore that wanted to hear Bananaphone.  Why?  Why?  Because that song I'll be singing for the next three months.  What song?  The Bananaphone song.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, Bananaphone.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, Bananaphone.  All right.  We're running out of show.  We've got to end with the most obnoxious 30 seconds ever. 
[02:10:00]  This person won a fine iMac.  What's his name real fast?  Charles G.  Charles G.  Once again, bravo for this fine piece of production as we end the first half of the O.P. and Anthony show.  Yes.  We'll see you over at XM in a few minutes.  But first, this once again.  Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha 
[02:10:30]  The Opie and Anthony XM walkover begins now. 
[02:11:00]  Yes.  Is your microphone working, Opie?  Mine is.  Why would it work?  Why would it work?  Jimmy, is yours?  It certainly is.  Yours is working fine.  Mine is working perfectly.  You might want to fix the boss's mic.  Let me hear Opie's hello.  No, it works fine.  He's talking quietly.  Hello.  It works. 
[02:11:30]  Hello.  Hello.  Wait, it just started.  Hello.  There it is.  That one works.  Let's walk.  Oh, you had the different thing with the thing.  With the who gives a shit.  They kicked that blackberry out of this dumb bear claw.  Now this isn't working.  It's just a joke.  You have the big, long...  Wait, why...  Well, they're not working now.  Opie's was working.  They're pulling that gag on him.  All right, let me see if that happens.  Hello.  No.  No, that one's not working.  Why would either one...  Now neither one is working. 
[02:12:00]  I just want to go home.  Let's go closer.  You can talk into mine if you want.  Or walk over.  Maybe we've got to get a little closer to the studio.  Yeah.  That's probably it.  That's the way it should work.  Because that'll then...  There.  Now the mics will kick in.  Right.  Why isn't Opie...  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Why don't you give the boss a mic.  Give them both.  Hello.  All right.  Hello. 
[02:12:30]  Well, I wonder if somebody right now is blankly staring at a screen.  Did you put a battery in it?  Did you check the...  Did you put a battery in it?  The, um...  The, uh...  Well, mine just cut out for a second.  That was nice.  Hey, Opie, do you want my mic?  No.  You can have it.  Oh, puppy.  Aw.  Let's kick it.  No.  Stupid dog.  Get him to the shelter, Mark.  Oh, look at the hairdo on this fucking thing.  What do you think this is? 
[02:13:00]  A...  Oh, look at the little old lady.  I know.  I have to put my fist right in the back of her head.  Yeah, you're homeless.  You're not...  Oh, Jesus.  Opie just went, ha-ha, you're homeless.  Oh, that was uncalled for.  The guy is sitting on the ground with a cup full of pennies.  And...  Whoa.  Whoa.  It was loud.  Ha-ha, you're homeless. 
[02:13:30]  Holy shit.  I have the evilness.  Put the ass on her.  Ha-ha, you're going to break it.  Fatty.  That's my new bit.  Hi.  The ha-ha bit.  I like it.  I like it.  Cool.  I'm going to try this.  Oh, now it's sunny and nice out.  Cool.  Okay.  Now I get heat for the first time today.  Ha-ha, you're right.  Mind your own...  Mind your own...  Mind your own business.  Let me do it for a day at least. 
[02:14:00]  That's great.  We got corn tickets to give away outside XM, I guess.  Oh, they'll love that.  Yeah, we'll do that.  Pat from Unaki has joined us, by the way.  Oh, ha.  For the walk.  Ha-ha.  How many hot dogs, Pat?  How many hot dogs?  Uh, 23.  Wow.  Half of what the winner did, right?  Not even?  Oh, no.  You did very good.  I'm very proud.  Next year, I'm going to do over 30.  An American, almost a contender, almost a winner this year, right? 
[02:14:30]  Yep.  Joey Chestnut.  Joey Chestnut.  He came up a couple of dogs short.  Hello.  Ugh.  Why do I even have a microphone today?  What's the matter, Jimmy?  I'm just cranky, slightly depressed, and tired.  Why are you depressed?  I don't.  You know how it is.  That's called being Jimmy Norton.  It's one of those days.  Aw.  Right now.  Yeah, it is.  I'm sure that will change, though. 
[02:15:00]  Predicting gloom and doom.  Why is this fucking Asian girl looking at us like she can't believe we have microphones?  Hmm.  Hey, what's the cop doing?  I don't know.  Hopefully shooting Mac.  How great would that be if he just gave him a good bludgeoning for no reason?  I would like to see that.  See him get tuned up on the corner there.  Wow.  Oh, he's...  What's that guy doing?  Oh.  Look at where he parked near a hydrant.  All right, give him a ticket.  Maybe we ought to tell him that's illegal. 
[02:15:30]  Maybe not.  You're looking for breakfast in a dumpster.  Oh, God.  Is that guy trying to find some food?  Hope he's got no heart, man.  Yelling at homeless people.  Take my mic off.  I'm not using it.  At least we yell at them behind their backs.  Not me.  Wow.  That fat black woman's there every day waiting for that poor bus. 
[02:16:00]  Has to haul her fat ass to some fucking poor office seat.  Oh, is this where we're giving, uh...  Oh, let's go in here.  No, I wasn't talking about you.  Oh, this is good.  What the hell?  What are we giving them away in an alley?  Is there a body back here?  Wow.  Very cool.  All right, where are the corn tickets?  We got to give them away.  I'd sell drugs back here, right?  Works like a good place to sell drugs.  Anyone want to buy some dope?  Who's got the corn tickets?  They told us we have to, uh, give them away, uh, very orderly. 
[02:16:30]  No one's got the corn tickets?  How many tickets we got?  Are they all stapled together?  Huh?  All right, everyone line up so you can get your corn tickets.  Line up nicely.  We're not going to have pandemonium like we did last time.  No.  Jimmy, get out of line.  Jimmy.  You are not qualified.  Who wants corn tickets?  We're going to do this orderly because last time there was a big mob scene that happened, right? 
[02:17:00]  It was like a riot.  That's right.  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  Oh, fuck.  Okay, if I may describe.  We are standing on a sidewalk with a huge opening where a building used to be and was knocked down.  And it is now a vacant and filthy lot. 
[02:17:30]  Obi had people line up for the corn tickets and then heaved them into this dangerous open lot.  No, that's not.  Oh, there's shit on that.  And heaved it into the lot.  They all went scrambling in to get them.  Have a good weekend, fuckers.  Sorry about the bad language.  Sorry about that.  Sorry about that.  What? 
[02:18:00]  A couple was in a vestibule at St. Pat's doing ass sex.  Lick, lick, lick, lick, lick.  Sounds great.  Eh, complete whores.  Obi and Anthony got this couple to have sex in New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral.  Desincration against the church is disrespectful.  It's a true sacrilege.  It was just a joke.  Obi's fault again.  How can we blow up our lives today?  Hugh Rocking said...  Uh-oh, we're in it again. 
[02:18:30]  They hire people who are artists to do a certain thing.  And then when they go too far, they suddenly wash the hands of them if they feel the heat is too heavy.  Obi and Anthony should not have been fired.  Technically, we didn't get fired.  They probably shouldn't have hired them in the first place.  Exiled radio hosts.  They had been fired in Boston after announcing that the mayor was killed.  Another prank.  And I go, Anthony, I got a great idea today.  We're going to tell the whole city of Boston that the mayor died in a fiery car crash while he was on vacation in Florida.  What do you think? 
[02:19:00]  Oh, my God.  Is this a bad one?  Oh, it just gets worse and worse.  Everything just went right down the crapper.  Can I just say fuck?  Yes.  The duo signed on with XM Satellite Radio.  Thank God.  Yeah, we'll make it work.  Oh, what a glorious day.  It's all about me.  I play golf with old guys.  I am a grinning idiot.  Act, act, act.  Hang on, it's Obi and Anthony.  We're back now.  The new cloud of the radio.  Ho, ho, Opie. 
[02:19:30]  Shut up!  Thank you.  You don't go to CNN for dick jokes.  Don't come to O&A for hard-hitting news.  I don't know.  Your mom's box.  We stink.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  The new cloud of the radio.  All right.  guitar solo 
[02:20:00]  guitar solo 
[02:20:30]  guitar solo 
[02:21:00]  That was fun. 
[02:21:30]  That was fun.  That was a good walkover.  Good walkover, good elevator ride.  Good elevator ride.  I don't know what I missed yet.  I'll find out in a second.  I asked Jimmy what elevator he was taking,  and then I made sure I was on a different elevator.  I used to do that, but you missed so much fun.  All I know is I was taking a leak,  and I just heard you guys get off an elevator,  and you were all cracking up. 
[02:22:00]  I stole whose bit?  Opie stole a bit?  Nelson.  Yeah, this is Nelson Muntz.  I wanted to tell you to stop stealing my bit, Opie.  What bit is yours, bro?  Ha ha.  You do the ha ha bit?  It's Nelson.  Huh?  Ha ha.  I suck.  It's Nelson from The Simpsons.  He's saying you stole this.  Oh, no, no, no.  Isn't that hee-hee?  Right.  He couldn't do it.  Sorry, Nelson.  Couldn't do it. 
[02:22:30]  All right.  Welcome to the second half of the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yes, right here.  Exclusively on XM Satellite Radio.  Here we are.  Life.  Yeah, we had fun in the elevator,  because what was up that woman's ass coming in the door?  She was a cunt.  I thought, well, it started,  I threw the corn tickets and all that,  and then I said, have a great weekend, fuckers.  Fuckers.  And I turn around, and I see this well-dressed businesswoman,  so I figured, all right, I am a nice guy  when I'm not playing the part of Opie 
[02:23:00]  on the Opie and Anthony Show,  so I said, I'm sorry.  Oh, sorry.  I'm sorry for the salty language.  Salty.  And then Jimmy and her just got into it  as we're waiting for the elevator.  She said something about sucking dick.  No, she says, what did she say?  I don't talk about sucking dick or something like that.  Something about talking about sucking dick.  She was annoyed that she has to come to work  and see huge signs that say something about sucking dick.  That's right.  Remember the big banner on Jimmy Day?  What was it again?  I don't remember.  I don't remember either.  It was something about sucking dick. 
[02:23:30]  And so I said something to her, like,  yeah, I was going to try to, like, egg her on,  but then I had my headset on, thanks, Steve.  Had my stuff on.  She goes, well, the radio show talks about sucking dick.  She goes, that's what you guys talk about.  And I'm like, what are you talking about?  And she goes, watch, I had to come to work  and see that sign.  And I'm like, well, we didn't write the sign.  Yeah.  And she goes, well, that's what you talk about.  And I said, well, no, I mean, sucking dick is great,  but that's not all we talk about.  And she started annoying me.  I'm like, well, who do you work for?  And she goes, well, not for you. 
[02:24:00]  And I'm like, look, no need to be snotty.  I'm trying to be nice to you.  And she goes, well, I work in the building.  I'm like, I'm done.  Enough.  And she's like, I work for The Economist.  And I'm like, well, we don't control what our fans do  any more than you control Islam's reaction to The Economist  because they have death threats.  Fucking douchebags.  You fucking, she needs to get fucked really well.  And I'm not the man for the job.  Are you the guy?  Oh.  No, I'm mediocre.  Can I ask?  I could give her like an average to awful lay,  which would make her crankier.  She just leaves, she leaves more pissed.  She was just irritating.  So I pulled a Frank the Frowner on the elevator. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  Which is very funny.  And then I made eye contact with Jimmy  in the middle of his Frank the Frowner.  And Jimmy started laughing and drooling.  Oh, you started drooling?  And I got to tell you, one of the listeners suggested this,  but Sam, we all get off and Sam stays on the elevator  so he could get more audio.  That's a reaction after everyone leaves the elevator.  There was that woman and I think another woman on the elevator  when we all left.  So he stayed on with the camera rolling  and I guess we'll have that audio. 
[02:25:00]  He said she didn't really say much.  No.  What does it say?  It says fancy man coming through, step aside.  No, that wasn't the one.  Yeah, that's a fancy man coming through, step aside.  There was a really rude one about it.  That offended her.  It's something about second gick.  Yeah, there was some really rude one about second gick.  Some awful sign about second gick.  Second little gick.  Probably Jimmy gave me AIDS or one of those.  Yeah, whatever.  It was something.  Something, something.  Something nutty.  Let's go to Pat in New Jersey.  Pat, what's up?  Pat?  Hey, guys.  I love you guys, but Steve's promo sucked. 
[02:25:30]  Which one, bro?  The one about when Opie met Patty.  Okay.  Ah.  It sucked, man.  Yeah, it had none of your lines in it.  It was all fucking Anthony's lines.  And it had nothing to do with me meeting Patty.  No.  Exactly, man.  Tell him to fucking do some more work.  Atta boy.  Wow.  I love you guys, man.  Yeah, you guys should call us out when the quality of the program isn't up there.  That's right.  Steve should be fired.  We're taking a vote.  And by us, we mean Steve. 
[02:26:00]  That's right, because our quality is way up there every single day.  We're above par.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Here's his subpar.  Who got knocked over when I threw the tickets?  Was it you, Ant?  I got pushed.  No, Jimmy got pushed.  I stepped out of the way.  I was laughing my ass off.  Did we get that on video?  Oh, no.  I'm sure everything gets videotaped.  We got it on video?  All right.  I was checking out some of the videos on YouTube.com last night, by the way.  Someone did a great montage of us and the fans and some of the characters that are part 
[02:26:30]  of the show.  For the walkover?  No, it was just a montage piece on the Opie and Anthony show.  Nice.  And then they have me as the WNBA stalker that I haven't seen in many, many years on YouTube.com.  Oh, shit.  That's the thing I did for more sports on ESPN.  Right.  So, it was pretty cool.  Because we were talking about these viral videos yesterday.  And, yes, they're up there on YouTube and other sites.  Viral sounds very dangerous.  Sign said, okay, this is why we have the greatest listeners in radio. 
[02:27:00]  They remember everything for us.  John in Pennsylvania.  John?  What's up?  Hey, John.  What was the sign?  It said, Jimmy sucked my cock and gave me the virus.  Or, yeah, or Jimmy sucked my cock and all I got was this virus or something.  Yeah, yeah.  Right on.  Thanks, John.  That's what it was.  No problem.  Well, this blonde that works in this building, yeah, didn't appreciate that sign.  Doesn't appreciate our sign.  She was angry.  Very, very angry.  All right.  I'm just setting up camp over here. 
[02:27:30]  Did we lose Sam?  Yeah, he's back.  Are they getting the audio for us?  Stupid pointed out feet.  Sam, anything happen after we all left the elevator?  Stupid coat rack feet.  Not really.  She asked if I was with you and then she was surprised that you worked on this floor, but  that's it.  Oh, really?  Why?  Is this like a snooty floor for a boring magazine?  She thought that you worked on a higher floor.  Oh.  Yes.  Tell her we do.  That's right. 
[02:28:00]  We answer to a higher authority.  What is the Eric Logan?  What are they right about?  Wow.  The callers kept it very dirty today for us.  Potty mouths.  What?  This is it?  Are you kidding?  Two days.  Oh, that's right.  We only had two days.  What did I get dumped out of yesterday?  The whackbag.  Oh, the whackbag.net thing.  That's right.  Here's today's dumper floor.  Live from the Opie and Anthony Show Studios.  The daily dump report. 
[02:28:30]  One channel.  One channel.  One channel.  Yeah, that's all I heard out of my right ear.  I had two.  I had one out of my right ear.  One channel.  I like one.  Try it again.  Live from the Opie and Anthony Show Studios.  Two channels.  The daily dump report.  That's better.  Wow.  All you potty mouth callers at 635.  Fucked up and fucked up again.  Fuck.  A caller.  All right. 
[02:29:00]  Red rubber sexy.  That has to be brought up.  At 727 a.m., fucking dogs.  Caller.  And 846.  Fuck off and fuck off and maybe a shit in there as well.  That was from our gay listener.  That was a really funny call, too, but I heard the shit.  I made it because he was cursing a lot.  I heard the shit.  Eating some blueberries, Ope?  I love blueberries.  I bought a lot of fresh fruit, and I've been eating a lot of strawberries and blueberries. 
[02:29:30]  You don't like strawberries?  No, I don't like blueberries.  Blueberries are good with antioxidants.  They're bitter.  They're bitter.  No, not when they're done.  They're bitter.  No, no, no.  They're not.  Those are vosberries.  Getting a nice report from the apartment.  Roaches and mouse entrapped.  Got another mouse.  Great.  And roaches.  Where are they in the heat?  And roaches.  I don't know.  When are you moving?  I'm working on it.  Didn't you put a bid into a place?  You said you were thinking? 
[02:30:00]  Yeah, I put a bid in.  30 bucks?  Are you going to get it?  Could be more than that.  Perhaps more than that, Anthony.  Weekly dump chart for the week, which was only two days long.  Yeah.  I got one dump, and the callers got seven.  Seven.  And that was it for the last two days.  Filth ridden.  God damn.  Another mouse.  And roaches.  The roaches are starting to happen now.  Dude, you're infested with bugs.  There's probably a dead mouse somewhere.  Of course there is.  It doesn't matter.  It's not like it's going to get really hot. 
[02:30:30]  You're infested with vermin and roaches.  I'm up to...  That's an expensive apartment, too.  You're paying a lot of rent there.  I know what you're paying.  Five mice in the last ten days.  Well over 20 total kills.  Holy shit.  Probably 25 to 30 kills.  That's an infestation.  Infestation.  25 to 30 kills.  Confirmed.  Confirmed kills.  A bunch of mice.  He's throwing death cards on them.  Two of diamonds.  This is spades.  Death cards. 
[02:31:00]  Let's Mickey know who done this.  It used to be fun, too.  It's not fun anymore.  It's terrible, dude.  It used to be fun to check the trap, see what I got overnight.  Now it's not fun.  Now it stinks.  It's not fun anymore.  Now it just, like, literally stinks.  It's creepy.  You see the electric trap light just blink in, and you know you got something in there.  Another corpse in there.  It's like, ugh.  He can drink out of my canteen anytime.  Any mouse brave enough to shit in an apartment with no furniture can drink out of my canteen anytime. 
[02:31:30]  He'd drink patty water.  Happy water.  Happy water.  Oh, guys.  Why are there people outside?  Who are these people?  I'm not going to mind them.  Who are those guys?  Yeah, what is it?  Stan?  Wait, we have to talk to them on the radio?  No.  No.  Who are they?  Iraq?  Iraq knows?  Yeah.  The people over there is the director that we're going to speak to in a few minutes.  Okay.  Ew.  I mean, cool. 
[02:32:00]  Cool.  And who are you guys?  How do they get up here?  Not that we might not mind them being here.  Why would we know who they are?  There's this guy sitting there.  I think they were able to just get past security.  No one knows.  Any shirts?  Who are they?  Yeah, he's a retired cop.  He's a fan of the show.  That's a little bit.  All right.  I'm up to watch.  There's nothing wrong with that, but who invited him up?  I don't know. 
[02:32:30]  Why is it badge?  Try to keep the light on him.  Always allowed.  Why would we know?  Steve?  He's not armed, is he?  Cops slipped by a different set of rules.  Steve?  Friend of Kenny's.  Friend of Kenny's.  Okay.  Friend of Kenny's and his kid.  Cops slipped by a different set of rules.  I got no problem with that.  No, no problem at all.  If they're willing to take the risk.  Just two odd men in Opie and Anthony shirts.  All right.  What's the movie?  Huh?  What's the movie?  What's the movie? 
[02:33:00]  What's the movie?  What's the movie, Iraq?  She was supposed to be on at 10-15.  Iraq.  Minnie's first time director.  What?  The part in italics.  Do we have...  The part in italics.  Where's the white...  Where's the one...  Do we have one sheet?  I'm sorry.  It's getting made right now.  Why wouldn't it be here?  Oh, Minnie's first time.  Yes.  That's the...  Director is Nick Guth.  You're on Nick?  Oh, where is Nick?  The guy.  It's Nick.  Oh, the boy.  All right.  It's Nick.  The boy.  Oh, I was bald. 
[02:33:30]  The young lad.  I like Baldwin and...  Oh.  Luke Wilson.  And Jeff Goldblum.  Minnie's...  What's it's...  What is it Minnie's first time doing?  I only hope it's fucking.  Yeah.  Right?  Hopefully it's a gang raid about a small mouse.  It's...  It's the old anal sex.  Let me see the card.  It's obviously anal sex.  Let me see the card.  Take a little look-see.  Why don't we take a break and we'll talk to her next because we have nothing else going on.  Where's the information?  Why don't we have this? 
[02:34:00]  Hey, you know...  Why would everyone have it?  I said Jeff Goldblum.  Oh, well, I was...  I didn't hear a word of it.  My damn headphones aren't working.  I said Jeff Goldblum.  Wait.  All right.  So, wait.  It's Alec Baldwin.  Alec Baldwin.  Nicky Reed.  Luke Wilson.  Carrie Ann Moss.  Wow.  And...  Goddamn rich cunt.  Jeff Goldblum.  Goddamn rich cunt.  Jeff Goldblum.  The yet lady at The Economist was rude to me.  Yes, yet Jeff Goldblum can say... 
[02:34:30]  Goddamn rich cunt.  In his first role ever.  And his finest, in my opinion.  His finest role with his jug head from the Archie's hat as he beat Charles Bronson's wife senseless.  Please, one more.  Goddamn rich cunt.  He's so angry.  He's just swinging wildly with a leather coat.  And we don't even have the second line to that.  What was it?  He says, Goddamn rich cunt.  I kill rich cunts.  Why don't we have that?  Why don't we have the whole line?  Why don't we have that line? 
[02:35:00]  Whole line.  Why would we have the whole line?  Why'd the mice crap out halfway?  Do we know?  Why would we know?  We'll get it working.  It was the first day we had four mics, by the way.  It was scary.  Thank God.  Because Opie got the spare mic once his petered out.  Which didn't work either.  Which didn't work either.  So we had four mics today, yet we only had two. 
[02:35:30]  So why don't we increase our odds and have just ten mics ready?  And then halfway three will work.  Can we just mic the street that we take the walk on?  See?  This is why I don't like blueberries.  A bruised blueberry.  It's moldy.  I buy my blueberries from a place on 85th Street where the fruit is fresh, and I wash them.  Why don't you wash your blueberries?  This is just inane babble.  It's blueberries.  I have to do an interview today with Sid Rosenberg in Florida.  I'm very happy.  Yeah, Sid's all right. 
[02:36:00]  Tell him we said hi.  He's a good boy.  Let's go to Rude Dog.  Rude Dog.  Hey, boys.  What's up?  Oh, not a lot.  I just want to see you guys suck.  All I've had in my head from 655 is ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  You guys are fucked up by weekend.  Thanks.  Language, young man.  This is my home.  Let's go inside the phone call.  655.  Depends on where he is.  Where are you?  Oh, I'm in Arizona.  Sorry, boys.  So 655 would be three hours behind, so that means it would be 9.55 our time, which hasn't 
[02:36:30]  happened yet.  555.  My bad.  Oh, that's weird.  All right.  Thank you, Rude Dog.  All right.  Later on, boys.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Oh, it doesn't end with that was annoying. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah.  Hey, that was annoying.  Hey, what's that?  You've never seen it before?  It looks like a rock.  New from Sedentary Toys and The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, it's so shiny.  It's got corners.  It's the cool new toy that has everyone jumping for joy.  O&A Party Rock.  It's not just any rock.  It's the O&A Party Rock.  The O&A Party Rock is incredibly versatile. 
[02:37:30]  You can chuck it.  You can fuck it.  You can drop it in a bucket.  You can race it.  You can chase it.  You can yell right in its face.  It's the bestest friend you'll ever have.  O&A Party Rock.  Why is it wearing a party hat?  Every Party Rock comes dressed in a colorful party hat and party blower, making it the centerpiece of any party.  Now with shiny red dancing shoes.  Not only that, the O&A Party Rock is...  Is...  Is...  Is...  Is...  Is a fucking rock, you dildo. 
[02:38:00]  Ah, it's a wolf mother.  Nice.  Jeremy?  Nice.  You're checking out The Opie and Anthony Show, The O&A Virus.  Exclusively on XM right now.  That's right.  Let's talk to, uh, the director of Minnie's First Time.  Opening July 14th. 
[02:38:30]  Who, uh, who's in that movie?  Uh, looks like, uh, Alec Baldwin.  Right.  Uh, Nicky Reed.  Yes.  Luke Wilson.  Carrie Ann Moss.  And, um...  Goddamn rich cunt!  Oh, Jeff Goldblum.  Jeff Goldblum.  Jeff Goldblum, right.  Who we love.  Hello, sir.  Hey, man.  How do you say your last name, Nick?  Uh, Guta.  Guta.  Guta.  Nick Guta.  Hello, miss.  And who is she?  My wife, Heidi, for her, who's actually a small role in the movie, but is a screenwriter 
[02:39:00]  by trade.  Oh.  And she has lovely boobies.  Yes, she does.  Jesus, Opie.  What?  What happened?  A little tact.  Well, but they're right there.  He's...  Mars is hugging people.  What are you doing, Mars?  Like hugging our guests.  He's just making sure her mic works.  That's all.  Jiminy Cricket.  Oh, now he's going to make sure the mic works.  Guaranteed the mic won't work.  Go ahead.  Check in.  Should I be able to hear myself in these?  Yeah.  I cannot.  And...  Maybe the volume's not up.  Turn the volume up.  Yeah, turn the volume up a little bit.  There we go. 
[02:39:30]  There we go.  And that mic works?  Because that'll be a miracle.  I don't know.  Wow.  It does.  Very good.  Ho, ho.  And it's Minnie's first time?  Yes, Minnie's first time.  The cast looks very, very nice.  Thank you.  I like my favorite, Jeff Goldblum.  Do you know about his early career?  His early career?  Yeah.  His first work.  His first work.  I thought it was a Woody Allen movie, but maybe I'm off.  No, you could be off on that one.  Okay, I've heard...  It was a very popular series of movies that were made. 
[02:40:00]  Okay.  Um, starring Charles Bronson.  Oh, was he in...  Death Wish?  He was in Death Wish?  Yeah.  Do I win something?  Death Wish.  And we have one of my favorite...  She's smart too.  She's smarter than me, that's for sure.  Do your headphones work?  Yeah.  So you'll hear this?  Okay, my favorite clip ever, ever from Jeff Goldblum in any movie ever, and it was from  his first role in Death Wish.  Okay.  Let's all listen.  Goddamn rich cunt!  That's Jeff Goldblum. 
[02:40:30]  Is that the best Jeff Goldblum clip?  I've read that on the internet, like...  Really?  Jeff Goldblum fan sites, they'll often...  They're like, moniker will be goddamn rich cunt!  It's gotta be.  It is the best scene in any movie ever.  We're having t-shirts made.  He's just beating the crap out of...  What's his name in the movie?  Paul Kersey.  Paul Kersey's wife.  Paul Kersey's wife, as his daughter is being raked in a corner, as they're spray painting  her ass.  Oh my god.  And he's beating her with some type of old blackjack or something? 
[02:41:00]  Blackjack.  He's got a Dick Tracy weapon.  And yeah, he just yells at her.  Goddamn rich cunt!  And there's more to it, and we don't have the end of it.  And it's, I kill rich cunts.  Why don't we have that?  And he just smacks it.  Oh, and it's just the best scene ever.  And he's wearing, like, you know that hat that Jughead wore in the Archies?  Yes.  That weird little thing with the...  The little crown.  ...little serrated, like, thing around it?  That's what he's wearing.  Really?  Tough guy.  You gotta see this.  He's a real tough guy.  How is it working with him?  He's done quite a few movies since then. 
[02:41:30]  He's done quite a few.  Quite a few.  He's terrific to work with.  Jeff's actually an incredibly dedicated actor.  Is he a weirdo, or is he, like, professional?  No, he's super professional.  He loves to rehearse.  I mean, he literally would rehearse seven, eight hours a day if I asked him to.  Is he one of those guys, though, that you could actually...  ...carry on a conversation with?  Totally.  Because I've had people like...  Like, what's his name?  God damn it.  Perry Farrell.  Perry Farrell.  He sat down and, yeah.  And I tried to actually have a conversation...  Because, you know, cool.  You want to, like, have a conversation with him. 
[02:42:00]  So far beyond anything I even understood what he was talking about.  He went from talking about, like, Lollapalooza to aliens coming down.  And seriously, like, that kind of weirdness.  And you're kind of sitting there going, boy, I would have liked to have maybe chatted with  this fellow.  We had dinner with Jeff during the production.  Went to see Sideways.  Yeah, we went to see Sideways with him and went to dinner.  No, Jeff's very easy to hang out with.  Who paid for dinner?  He did.  He did, actually. 
[02:42:30]  Now that I think about it.  Wow.  Yeah, I tried to.  He wouldn't let me.  He was like...  Couldn't for you.  Yeah, I was like, yeah.  We also got a table faster than we would have.  Well, 6'5", he walks into a restaurant.  Is he 6'5"?  Yeah.  Wow.  He's one of those guys like Christopher Walken where they walk around and people  just, like, gravitate.  And people absolutely know exactly who they are.  Yep.  How'd you get him and Alec Baldwin for your first film?  That's a pretty impressive cast for your first shot out.  Well, Kevin Spacey was our producer, and I was working with Kevin. 
[02:43:00]  Actually, the whole reason the movie happened, actually, is sitting right next to me here.  My wife is also a screenwriter, and we worked together a lot.  And we'd come up with this pitch.  She'd come up with this idea that we worked out a pitch for, and we needed a movie star  to attach themselves to it.  And I heard Kevin on a radio program being interviewed talking about how his company was set up to  find, like, you know, undiscovered talent, blah, blah, blah.  And I was like, yeah, sure, Mr. Movie Star.  We'll see.  So they sent over this script as a writing sample, and I got to work with him on that. 
[02:43:30]  And then I got the rights to this movie back.  And he and his producing partner, Dana Burnett, he liked the script so much, they said, let's  make this movie.  We should make a film that I'm not in.  And they went out and basically beat up their talent agency to find the money.  And then we got the money, and so then he was able to call Alec, because they worked together  on Glen Gary Glen Ross, and sent him the script.  And Alec really liked it, sat down with me, and I guess thought I wasn't crazy.  Is that all it takes?  Well, I mean, a little more. 
[02:44:00]  You had to admit you hated George Bush.  I'm in.  You had to get in the head.  Oh, thanks.  Thanks.  Thanks.  Thanks.  Hollywood.  We'll be at the airport Ramada this week.  Until Thursday.  The, yeah, after Alec signed on, you know, he's an actor magnet.  We got Nicky Reed two days later, and then Luke about a couple weeks after that.  And Jeff Goldblum, actually, part of why he did the film was because, actually, when 
[02:44:30]  I wanted to be a director, I actually went to acting school for a couple years, the same  school he taught at.  And so, although I didn't study with him, he was very comfortable with, you know, sort  of speaking the same language.  What did you direct just before this movie?  Me?  Yeah.  Um, it was the Corcoran State, uh, Christmas, uh, pageant, uh, see, that's, now how the  hell do you go?  That's what we're getting into, Matt, and then all of a sudden.  No, no, no, I didn't direct anything.  Um, no, I mean.  Like, what was the thing you did just before the movie?  Nothing. 
[02:45:00]  Uh, I mean, we had both, we'd both been working screenwriters for a long time.  You gotta be, like, thinking you won the lottery or something.  But directing, now you have to.  Well, okay, I'll, I'll.  How do you know, but I'll.  And, and it's great when it's your friends or something.  Yeah.  But now these are actors that know direction.  Yeah.  We really want to know, what were you doing just before this job?  And then all of a sudden you're telling these guys what to do.  Well, but again, here's the thing.  This thing I tell all first-time directors or people who want to be directors, go to acting  school.  Fuck film school.  Seriously. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  It's a waste of money.  I mean, it's just a waste of money.  I, I, I, I had people on my, working on the crew who were $100,000 in debt from going  to film school.  And I would have said to their parents, give those kids $100,000 and let them go make a film.  That's a Kevin Smith thing.  And, and I, and, but, but if you go to acting school, which is far cheaper, uh, you learn  how to, you learn what, how actors work.  You learn how to direct them because you're being directed by other people.  And you also, it improves your writing too, because when you have to say other people's  words week in and week out, you learn what sounds good to you pretty quickly. 
[02:46:00]  And so I, you know, also the actors know you're not bullshitting them.  What do you do with your hands?  What do you mean?  That's always my problem when I act.  I never do it with my hands.  If I'm sitting, what do you do?  Like I, well, if I'm sitting, I'll put them on a table, elbows up and I'll gesture like  that.  I'm fucking finished when I have to stand.  When you're standing?  I just tend to like stiffen up or put them in my pockets.  It's just so awkward.  Should they be close to your body?  Touch your, when in doubt, when in doubt, touch your package.  Should they do that?  When in doubt, touch your package.  Then you have to recreate it for every take. 
[02:46:30]  Very difficult.  Yeah.  And I, I played Jeff Goldblum's call golf.  Prostitute in the movie.  Oh, Jennifer.  Yeah.  Jennifer.  Yes.  And, uh, very hard.  Yeah.  You know what, cause your hands, if you move them this way, when they, when they, uh, go  from the other angle, you gotta go like that.  You gotta remember, you gotta remember where they are.  Can't grab your package though.  You're doing a scene with Dakota Fanning.  Just grabbing your cock over and over.  I'm in prison.  I was suggesting you grab your package and I'm saying, oh, it wouldn't work.  He makes a good point. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah.  That's boy.  That is some first gig then.  Thank you.  At least you knew what you were doing though.  Mm-hmm.  Seemed to.  Did, did you have any times where you were like, holy shit, I don't have a clue here  what to do and just kind of fake it.  Oh, absolutely.  Oh, great.  Great.  Absolutely.  Oh yeah.  No, totally.  The thing is never, uh, never sort of decree.  I mean, never like, I learned pretty quick in the first week, like never turn to your,  your DP.  And, uh, and that doesn't mean double penetration.  Yeah, it could.  Um, never turn, never turn to your cinematographer and sort of go like, well, so what do you know, 
[02:47:30]  I was thinking this, what do you think?  You know, and let's just, let's just kind of workshop it out.  Never do that.  No.  Like, you two go off together in a corner and you come back and you declare what the  decision is.  Not in front of people.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's important.  Who is your, uh, DP?  Somebody experienced that?  A great guy actually.  Yeah.  His name is Dan Stoloff.  He shot Miracle, the, uh, US hockey movie.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, he shot a great little movie called Tumbleweeds that came out about six, seven years  ago.  And, uh, I think he just finished one right now in Iowa.  All right.  So he's had some, uh, experience. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah.  He's very, very.  Now, how much of the camera work is actually the director's genius or, or, or, or, or the DP?  Like, when you look at, like, when you look at, like, when you look at, I was talking  about Kubrick one time, the long shot, the hallway shot, which I guess was, uh, it was  just, I thought it was amazing.  And someone said, yeah, but his DP was a great DP.  Well, you should, you should pick a great DP.  I picked a DP who, uh, I thought would challenge me.  I didn't want somebody to come in and go, like, just, oh, so what do you want?  I'll do it.  I mean, I knew what I wanted very specifically. 
[02:48:30]  Uh, I had a lot of time to think about this because the movie took six and a half years to  get made.  So, you know, and sort of the money would come together, fall apart, come together,  fall apart until we hooked up with, uh, Dana and Kevin.  And, uh, the, and so I knew exactly visually what I wanted, but I wanted somebody who believed  in that, but also would challenge me and go like, you know, I know you see it this way,  but if we did it this way, a, it might be easier for us to shoot and B, you're going  to get the same effect.  And I've been doing this a while.  Trust me, we don't have a lot of time. 
[02:49:00]  And if you don't have a lot of time on your first movie, you should pick a real experienced  TV and listen to them when they really say to you, like get in your face, like, look,  this day is going to be a bear to shoot.  If we don't cut this shot and cut this shot, we're not going to finish the day.  Do you have a, do you feel you have a look, you know, certain directors, you can tell  like Spielberg, you know, it's Spielberg when you say it, like, do you do things that get  like, you have a certain look where you go, that's, that's mine.  See that move right there.  That's mine.  Like Kubrick, it was a long, long, long. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um, I, I would say maybe, um, I would say, I don't know if it's a look, but there's a lot  of movement in the film.  I really believe there's a lot of movement.  I really believe in keeping the camera moving almost at all times, not in a jittery way,  like that kind of like Michael Bay, like you get nauseous kind of thing, but more just  that the camera's always kind of moving so that it's kind of always drawing you in.  Um, I think also, um, in terms of look, it's actually in some ways a sound in that I really  worked with my composer really closely to kind of.  Kato.  Oh yeah. 
[02:50:00]  His name is Kato.  We only have one name.  Kato.  Kato.  Yeah.  He's from, uh, Norway.  He's very, he looks like, uh, uh, one of those, uh, like sort of extras from dark city.  It's like, like super tall.  He looks like, um, almost like, uh, yeah.  Like you gave us any of that movie, dark city.  No, he's like, he's like tall.  He's like, if uncle Fester was stretched out to like six foot five.  Oh, okay.  Um, but anyway, Gary, the music, the music I paid a lot of attention to cause it, I really  wanted to draw people into the film in the first 10 minutes and kind of suck them into  this world cause it is a pretty crazy world.  And yeah, what is, uh, give us the gist of the movie. 
[02:50:30]  Well, it's real simple.  It's basically about a girl in LA who will try anything once she sort of views her life  as by the idea that, uh, any new experience should be experienced regardless of what society  thinks about it.  And this leads her to actually, um, become a call girl.  And, uh, on her second night, the trick ends up being her stepfather played by Ike Baldwin.  Fantastic.  And so she, she turns the lights out, uses his tie, ties his eyes around and, uh, kind  of does him in the dark, so to speak. 
[02:51:00]  How does he not know?  Well, because, because they live together in the same house for five years, but he pays  no attention to her.  And she kind of like starts speaking in the Southern accent.  He doesn't like, so she walks into the room, she sees him, he doesn't see her.  She ducks me into the bathroom.  He's like, Hey, sugar, sorry, I'm late.  And, you know, she's a twisted kind of girl.  She'll try anything once.  And so then afterwards she actually leaves her keys in the hotel room and he comes running  out and realizes it's her.  Um, and, um, and then, yeah, well, yeah, I don't want to give too much of your way.  I got like a half a rod already. 
[02:51:30]  Fantastic.  It's definitely, uh, it's a, it's a, it's a really, it's, I mean, is she low priced or  high priced?  High priced, high priced.  Oh, God damn rich cunt.  He, um, sorry.  He, uh, no, it's, uh, it's, it's, it's definitely fun.  We were, uh, the insider called us the most twisted movie of the summer and that's coming  from Pat O'Brien himself.  So I'll take that.  Yeah.  I'll take that any day.  Again, one of our favorite clips.  Me, you, Steven, Alex.  A little Coke, whores. 
[02:52:00]  Well, that sounds good though.  I like that.  Kind of twisted.  It is twisted.  Like a movie that takes a little twisted.  It's definitely kind of like wild, wild thingsy, uh, wild thingsy Lolita kind of a movie.  Well, who does, uh, Goldblum play?  He plays the neighbor, uh, who's a TV producer who lives next door, who's had-  A reality TV.  Reality TV producer.  Who's had many, um, had many, um, uh, he's sort of slept with Carrie Ann Moss.  Who's, uh, Nikki Reed's mother in the movie.  Sort of, sort of, he, they're sort of fuck buddies.  And, um, uh, when, uh, Alec and Nikki start having this, this, uh, relationship, he becomes, 
[02:52:30]  Alec becomes sort of convinced that the neighbor is onto them and, uh, going to use, uh, use some  information to blackmail them because they shouldn't really be together.  Nice.  Yeah.  Twist and turn.  No little twist.  Twist and turns.  Yeah.  Goldblum's very, he's funny in this movie.  Um, Jeff might actually beat someone violently.  Well, if you like, if you like Jeff Goldblum's scenes with fighting, you're going to love this  one.  Let's just put it this way.  There's a golf club involved.  Great.  And Baldwin and, uh, him kind of go at it.  Nice. 
[02:53:00]  Mono a mono.  Nice.  And, uh, it's fun.  It's a fun kind of career.  It sounds like it.  It sounds really good.  Yeah, definitely.  Well, you can see it, uh, July 14th.  July 14th.  Four theaters so far with more to be announced, right?  Yeah.  New York and L.A. to start and then around the country after that.  Well, there's two in New York.  There's two in New York.  Probably another two are going to be added.  Uh, and they're four in L.A.  And, uh, in New York we're at the Empire and, uh, the Village 7 and then probably one on  the Upper West Side.  Our brand new buddy, Joel McHale?  Yes.  Who's in this?  Our brand new buddy?  He is awesome.  Yeah. 
[02:53:30]  Joel is so funny.  Yeah, he really is.  He was, we, we, actually the first day of shooting was with Joel.  He plays the host of the reality TV show that Jeff produces called Absolutely Positive.  And, uh, Joel is truly hilarious.  And, uh, anyway.  Cool.  Yeah, he's a good guy.  Well, looking forward to seeing it, man.  Absolutely.  And absolutely.  Sounds good.  Definitely sounds like one of those things.  Look for, look for, look for Heidi's movie with Paris Hilton shooting later this year,  The Hottie and the Naughty.  The Hottie and the Naughty.  Which is, ooh.  Yes, which one she plays.  Ah. 
[02:54:00]  But I didn't write it for her.  Oh, you wrote it?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I'm a screenwriter.  I wrote it three and a half years ago, but I sold it a week and a half ago.  How big are her feet?  She's got big feet, right?  I have big feet.  But she's got, like, talons.  We haven't met her yet.  Do you know what I am?  I haven't met her.  My director, Tom Putnam, has met her several times, but I have not had the Paris meeting.  Look at her feet.  We can get back.  We're here.  They're giant.  We can get back to you on that.  Yeah.  And your text message.  I don't even have, like, a fetish or anything. 
[02:54:30]  I just, like, it bugs me.  Right, right.  It bugs me that a girl that's so tiny, like, like that, has big feet.  You like them bound?  Do you like them bound up?  Yeah.  Bind them when they're young.  Yeah.  Keep them, like, really small.  Yeah.  Cripple.  Yeah.  Or just, you know, get the sledgehammer and the piece of railroad tie and just wham.  Smack those.  I want to be in.  Do you like Misery?  Do you like to hobble?  Yeah.  Hobble.  Hobble a girl.  Jimmy would not.  Jimmy would like to be in a movie.  I'd like to be in a movie, please.  He's an actor.  He's in Lucky Louie on HBO.  I know.  I'd like to be in a movie. 
[02:55:00]  Yes.  What kind of movie would you like to be in?  Spider-Man?  Any.  Any?  Kind of movie.  Really?  Yeah.  I might be directing.  Oh.  I might be directing Girls Who Crave Through More Cocks Vol. 8.  Oh.  I'd be happy to play any part of that.  Any part of the girl.  Guest cock number six.  The one that doesn't work on film.  Fucking panicking Pete, I'd be.  A little limp noodle.  Oh, he's struggling.  Everyone on set waiting, huffing, puffing.  I've watched that happen. 
[02:55:30]  The fluffers are crying.  Yeah.  I've watched someone struggle on film.  It was fucking awful.  Yeah, it's really uncomfortable.  Guy's trying to bang his nose his first time.  And it was like one of those low-budget porn with the guys holding the lights and the camera.  And I'm talking to this guy.  We're laughing and having fun.  And the guy can't get a ride.  We all had to leave the room.  There's a fucking guy with his Brazilian girlfriend.  And they fucking walk up to the trailer.  And my buddy, who's like, he's a cameraman.  He was shooting something.  And they walk in.  He goes, hey, what is she here?  To clean the fucking place?  So we just kind of put like a shitty vibe on the whole thing.  It's hard.  He did like a fucking made joke. 
[02:56:00]  So this guy's girlfriend walked in.  It was really great.  Yeah, let's say hi to Sally in Chicago.  Sally.  Hey.  Hi.  You haven't said the name of the movie yet, have you?  Oh, Minnie's first time.  Sorry.  Minnie's first time.  And it comes out July 14th.  Sounds very hot.  Really sexy.  It sounds interesting.  I was just, you know, it's like, what the hell's the name of the movie?  As a rule, incest is always sexy.  Yes, but it's not technically, because it's a stepfather.  Yeah, it's a step.  So it's just like.  No, it's technically not the same.  It's more really dirty than sick. 
[02:56:30]  But it's also sick.  Right.  Sally.  Is that Sally from Chicago?  Yes.  Sally, you can also check out the website at www.minnysfirsttimethemovie.com.  Great.  You can watch the trailer there and learn more about that.  Wait, minnysfirsttimethemovie.com.  Somebody tells me Minnie's first time was already taken.  Yeah.  You know what's really disturbing?  You know what's really disturbing?  I was Googling it.  I was Googling it, like, last week, and there's this Canadian, like, porn website that somebody 
[02:57:00]  named Minnie, who lives in Saskatchewan, like, came off the farm and, like, did a porn, apparently.  minnysfirsttimethemovie.com is under construction right now.  Did you spell it right, E-Rock?  Yeah.  How'd you spell it?  M-I-N-I-S.  No apostrophe, probably.  Yeah.  First time.  Yeah.  It's under construction.  Yeah, some kind of, uh, there's probably a construction worker under Minnie's.  I bet there's just going to be-  The Yukon Territory somewhere.  Hardcore porn.  Yeah, it sounds like an anal site or something like that, or some chick-  That virgin thing. 
[02:57:30]  Where you know she's not really a virgin.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, yeah, that site was taken a lot.  Anything, almost anything with first time is taken on the internet.  A lot of movies now, they have to put the movie at the end of the thing, because, like,  people just bought up everything.  Exactly.  It was like, it was like the beginning of Monopoly with the internet.  I don't know.  I was surprised we got that.  You just buy, buy, buy, buy everything, and then by the time, uh, you know, uh, 2006  rolls around, there really isn't anything left.  Well, I was surprised we got .com, even.  Yeah.  We got the .tv.  .tv.  That's okay, isn't it? 
[02:58:00]  It's just like-  That's so done.  That's no one's going to your site.  I have to do .net, and I have, uh, Jim Norton.com is taken by a cyber squatter, who I hope  has fucking prostate and throat cancer.  Um, I hope, I really do.  I hope they're dead.  Yeah.  Nice.  And, um-  Don't give it up, huh?  Well, I haven't, I've contacted them once, and they weren't interested, but there's legal  stuff you can do, because there's some foreign cunt cyber squatter.  Yeah, we got ours, but-  Threaten his, uh, life.  Let's say hi to Alex in South Dakota.  Alex.  Hey, I was wondering if-  Alex!  Come to a- 
[02:58:30]  What?  I'm here.  I was wondering if this movie's ever going to come to a god-awful state like this, or  are we going to have to wait for it to come on DVD?  I will give you the answer if you tell all your friends in New York and L.A. to go first  weekend, and we kick some ass.  Yeah, it's one-  Yeah, the-  It's an independent movie, but it's got stars in it, so we, you know, if we kick ass in  New York and L.A.  If the movie shows that it has legs, it'll go, uh, elsewhere.  It'll definitely get there.  That's right.  Definitely.  All right, sounds good.  Thanks.  I love the poster.  I don't know why.  I love the-  This is the-  You want to know why?  It's a hot chick.  You want to know why? 
[02:59:00]  Why?  I'll tell you why.  Subliminal stuff?  Red and yellow-  Subliminal stuff.  They elicit feelings of hunger in the brain.  Why do you think McDonald's and Burger King and all those companies use that in their primary  logos?  Because it elicits hunger in your brain.  So you put a girl in a red bikini on a yellow raft, and you go.  And what about the-  I want to eat her.  What about the blue background?  Anything?  That's water.  Just water.  That's just water.  You should have had, like, blue. 
[02:59:30]  No.  It's the colors.  You're right.  It would have been a little scary to have her, you know, floating in a sea of green.  This is a great- She's floating, like, obviously in pool water, and it kind of fades into, like, Baldwin and Goldblum at the top.  It's almost a little, like, Jaws in a weird way.  Like, she's sort of floating below them, and she's going to, like, you know, come up and-  Get eaten.  Yeah, no, she's-  Well, very simple.  I like it.  Yeah, we were fortunate.  We are, you know, we were shooting some shots from above down as she was floating, and the still photographer was on set, and he took this photo, and he just turned to me and goes, I think that's the poster. 
[03:00:00]  Let me ask you a question.  Do red and yellow really-  Do they do hunger in the brain?  Because McDonald's has been red and yellow since, like, what, the 50s?  So I'm wondering if that's because of McDonald's, or if McDonald's incorporated that because of-  Chicken and egg theory.  I love it.  I love it.  Only because-  You've got to put him in a movie.  Maybe we're all just been conditioned.  He's a good guy.  I see him as, like, yeah, I'm seeing you now as, like, the-  Boring guy at the party.  I'll be boring guy at the party, but perhaps I can be, you know. 
[03:00:30]  You know, doesn't necessarily.  Just taking everything they say conversationally and making it literal so I can get attention  focused on me, and they go, shut up, douchebag.  I go, but really?  Seriously?  That's a good question.  I don't know.  I just know all those fast food chains.  They all have red and yellow.  So, but, you know, the yellow in that was just, we were lucky that the floaty thing was  that kind of nice color yellow.  But, yeah, it's definitely eye-catching.  It actually makes sense, too, because every time I see a bleeding Asian, all of a sudden I  want food.  And it is one of the worst human beings in the world, and he's all ours. 
[03:01:00]  And that's why he needs to be in a movie.  Good luck with this, man.  It actually looks really good.  I love the cast.  Alec Baldwin, Nicky Reed, Luke Wilson, Carrie Ann Moss.  I'm not familiar with her.  I'm familiar with her.  She's the snatch.  Carrie Ann Moss?  Yeah, I don't know.  Trinity from The Matrix?  Yeah.  Oh, I've seen it, but I don't remember it.  I'm a fucking pop culture idiot.  Yeah, he is. 
[03:01:30]  Dude, I didn't know what show Felicity Huffman was on.  I saw Transamerica, which the fact that Reese Witherspoon won over her, somebody should  be fucking executed.  But I have that Desperate Housewives of her show.  I've never seen it.  So, I mean, I'm not up on pop culture.  I don't do that to be...  What was the last movie you guys...  The Matrix?  I mean, Jesus Christ, that transcends pop culture.  That was all right.  You better know it, or they kick you out of the country.  What was the last movie you guys saw that you liked?  What was the last movie we saw that we liked?  We just saw...  We liked The Breakup.  We liked The Breakup, yeah.  That was fun.  Yeah, that was all right. 
[03:02:00]  I did one of the worst auditions of my life for that film.  Yeah, he tried out for The Breakup.  Oh, it was awful.  I was out there shooting a movie.  They went with Vince Vaughn or you?  No, Jennifer Aniston, actually.  I wanted to play his lumpage.  No, it was...  It was a bad one.  It was his friend who tried to get him to move out of his condo.  I gave an abysmal read.  I didn't even want to do the auditions.  I was concentrating on something else.  The movie didn't do too well, because it didn't have that Hollywood ending.  It didn't have Jimmy.  It's actually done really well.  Well, it left the theaters pretty fast, though.  I think they were expecting a little more out of that movie.  I don't know. 
[03:02:30]  But they didn't have the classic Hollywood ending, and I think that bothers people.  Well, they might have gotten confused, because Matthew McConaughey just did a film like  this with Sandra Bull.  It was some film they just did with this...  Oh, right.  Failure to Launch or something?  It couldn't be anything but repulsive.  It couldn't be.  Fuck it.  You know, the fun movie poster where they're kind of both running in the same direction.  Some movie posters or covers of DVDs in the video store or something, I look at and go,  it, like, makes me angry that I look at it. 
[03:03:00]  Absolutely.  And it is those, you know, he's got his hat off, and he's like, somebody having a good  time, kids all around him, and he's got that exhausted look.  The everyman Steve Martin face, which that elicits feelings of nausea when you see that  dumb fucking face he makes in every poster, that fucking cheaper-by-the-dozen-eight, you  know, regular guy trapped in these circumstances, harumph, yuck, happy to you.  Superman has our producer in it.  Yeah.  Ooh. 
[03:03:30]  Lex Luthor.  Saw it.  Loved it.  Well, yes.  Your producer.  Thought it was great.  There you go.  Yay, Kevin.  Yeah.  How great is fucking Kevin Spacey in, if we're going to talk about Spacey, one of the  best films ever, Swimming with Sharks.  He's amazing at Swimming with Sharks.  I know.  I know.  What a prick.  That's a great little film.  Oh, my.  He plays this douchebag.  Benicio Del Porro.  Yes, he plays his assistant before Frank Whaley.  One of his first roles, yeah.  Frank Whaley actually did stand-up comedy a couple times.  I brought him out at the Boston Comedy Club.  He was in that. 
[03:04:00]  He's in a few small films.  Pulp Fiction.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That guy.  Yeah, yeah, Frank Whaley.  Check out the big, yeah, exactly.  And the woman they played with the cast was kind of odd, though, because she had, like,  one of those moles.  She had a weird mole somewhere on her face, which I keep remembering.  Cindy Crawford?  No, it wasn't her.  Do you know what I mean?  The only mole-faced girl I know.  No, no, no, in Swimming with Sharks.  Oh, oh, that.  I don't know.  Guy for a chick?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I know the actress.  I know the actress.  I don't know her name, though.  I don't know her mole.  Yeah, I don't know her mole.  I saw the play, Gary Glenn Ross, and none of them were as good as fucking the movie. 
[03:04:30]  I mean, I know it's really easy to say, but I wanted to try Alan Old I love, so I wanted  to see him play Shelley, and it's just Jack Lemmon buried him, and it's like...  Well, you know what?  It depends on the night with theater.  It depends on the night.  Yeah.  It's like sometimes they're really on, sometimes they're tired.  You know, it's eight shows a week.  It's like a radio show.  Kind of, yeah.  It depends on the day.  Some days we're off, some days we're mediocre.  Michael in Atlanta.  Michael?  Yeah, the breakup made $112 million.  It cost $52 million to make.  I see.  That's a pretty fun one.  There you go.  Good bomb there, Ropey.  Who's stupid today? 
[03:05:00]  That one went right into the fucking drain.  There you go.  That was a studio marketing executive pretending to be from Atlanta.  Some of us saw Clerks 2 last night.  What did they say?  I liked it a lot.  I thought it was great, yeah.  I think it's going to do very well.  I hope so, because he's a nice guy, even though he recommended War of the Worlds, Kevin  Smith.  He sat here and told us it was the most compelling movie he'd seen.  Yeah, we asked about what was his favorite movie recently.  He said War of the Worlds.  Yeah.  He realized he's one of the producers.  Oh. 
[03:05:30]  Well.  I'll tell you one thing I liked about War of the Worlds.  The story, everything.  We know what it was, Tom Cruise, enough.  Those creatures were great.  Yeah.  The sound that came out of them, and the way they just, yeah, it was like loud.  It's squeaky, kind of like squeaky, kind of like.  And the mechanics of them and everything, the way they moved on film, that was very cool.  The CG work on that was amazing.  But the movie itself, yeah.  The fuselage in the living room, and everyone's still sleeping in the basement. 
[03:06:00]  All right.  I couldn't get past that.  All right.  You got to kind of.  Land to the living room.  No one's waking up.  It landed out front.  It kind of clipped the house.  It kind of clipped the house.  The tree.  A 747 clipped your house.  It was windy last night.  There's a flaming engine spinning outside, but you slept through.  And they're in the kitchen, and obviously the cupboards and the fridge filled with food,  but they're worried about the food they brought from their house in a box.  Look.  I said I like the CG work.  I'm a continuity guy when I watch movies. 
[03:06:30]  I don't blame you.  I don't blame you, man.  I never understood in science how the aliens choose a planet that's three quarters covered  in water when they're allergic to water.  What the hell is that?  Maybe, you know, they were probably going, and all of a sudden it was like.  Oh, we got to land here.  Damn.  Uh-oh.  Yeah, now we got to land.  Let's hide in the cornfield.  We're out of gas.  Where there's no dew on the corn in the morning or night.  Right.  See?  You're with me.  Come on.  Why didn't they go to the Sahara?  Why aren't they hanging out like with King Lawton in the desert? 
[03:07:00]  Why don't they try it out in Arizona and then maybe movies?  Slowly.  Slowly movies.  Let me figure this water problem out.  Yeah, right?  They hate moisture.  Believe me, I've been with plenty of vaginas they could have lived in.  Oh, my God.  Sorry.  Wow.  His wife's right here.  She's taking notes, but that's ending up in our next film right there.  I'll steal anything you say.  Anybody in the business doesn't care.  Nothing shocks them.  They're fine.  No.  She's a good egg.  All right.  It's Minnie's First Time. 
[03:07:30]  And, yes, it comes out July the 14th.  Yeah.  This actually looks really good, man.  Usually we have to kind of be polite sometimes when people are in it, but this is something  I really want to see.  Yeah.  And the website is minnysfirsttimethemovie.com to find out more.  Awesome.  Thanks for dropping by.  Thanks, man.  Thanks a lot.  Thanks a lot.  Best of luck with this.  Absolutely.  And, look, it'll be your first director thing in Internet Movie Database.  Hopefully you'll have a whole line of them after that.  I hope so.  And if the movie is successful, we'll never see it again, so have a good night.  No, I'll come back.  You'll never come back.  No, no, no.  That's a promise. 
[03:08:00]  We'll be like, holy shit, could you believe that guy, that that director was in our...  Yeah, Jack White said the same thing, Tom.  No, no, no.  We'll definitely come back.  Yeah, all right.  I don't forget favorites.  Jack Black.  I'm sorry.  Jack Black used to come on our show until he blew up.  And now he doesn't remember our names.  That guy's terrific, though.  What pizzazz he has.  I could watch him for hours and not get sick of him.  Just the same funny thing after anything gets me every time.  This is how pathetic we are.  We get you guys on the way up and on the way down.  Never at the top. 
[03:08:30]  I'll be back.  Don't worry about it.  We've been trying to get Dreyfuss since fucking Close Encounters, and we finally got him like  what?  We finally got him last week.  Yeah.  Two weeks ago.  We got him a couple of weeks ago.  Because he had to be in the movie.  He signed my Close Encounters.  They wanted to promote that fucking hunk issue.  They actually sent us the boat.  I saw that movie, and I could not believe how short it was.  It was the shortest movie I've ever seen.  Really?  Barely over an hour, I would say.  That's better.  Was it really that bad?  It was, all right, let's say an hour and 15 tops.  That's better.  Tops.  Come on, but that's better than like two and a half hours, three hours. 
[03:09:00]  That's true.  I like a lot.  All my favorite movies are long movies, though.  Godfather, Cuckoo's Nest, Clockwork Garden, Raging Bull.  Those are classics.  The good, the bad, the ugly.  Action adventures.  Good, the bad, the ugly.  I love when they show that on TV.  It starts at nine in the morning, ends at seven at night.  Yeah.  If people had to sit through that crappy movie so I could meet Dreyfus, I could give  a shit.  Absolutely.  I don't care.  That was a highlight right there.  Well worth it.  Godfather 3?  Ugh.  Dad.  Stop.  That's Sofia Coppola, man. 
[03:09:30]  If she doesn't move you, well, you shouldn't watch movies.  He's not going to come.  He might be working with these people.  He's a young director on his way up.  Everybody you mention is like, he just goes, ha ha ha.  You notice how he shut up since we said Tom Cruise?  I understand.  He's got to be smart.  I mean, look, I'm not trashing comedy club owners.  I'm going to be fucking, you know, say.  I trash you.  I just know where my future isn't.  And believe me, I could shit on Tom Cruise and Steve Martin all day because I'll never  work with them. 
[03:10:00]  You never know.  You never know.  Nah, Steve Martin, I wouldn't want to work with.  You never know.  That's what happened to him.  I'm kidding.  He still didn't tell us his job before he made this movie.  Oh, I'll tell you my jobs.  I mean, I worked at Domino's once.  You did?  Yeah.  I sold dating service memberships.  Oh, wow.  And the job right before this?  Well, no.  We were screenwriters.  I mean, yeah.  It took a long time to get this.  Yeah, it took 15 years.  It'd be great if you said, I was delivering pizzas and then I was directing Alex Jones.  Oh, well.  That would be the bit.  That doesn't really happen. 
[03:10:30]  Please tell me.  Did you see the Pink Panther remake?  No.  No.  Exactly.  Should that not be an executable offense for anybody to do that to Peter Sellers?  He rules with an iron fist.  I heard it had problems.  I heard it had problems.  I did not see it.  There are movies you should just leave alone.  Sure.  The In-Laws was one of the greatest comedies ever and they had to remake that with Michael  Douglas.  I was like, Michael Douglas is great.  Why would you do that?  You don't need to do that.  Steve Martin used to be great. 
[03:11:00]  Fucking, I love that guy.  The Jerk and Rocks, whatever.  You know his movies.  He was fantastic.  Those family movies, man.  They pay well.  I know.  They pay well.  I'm Sam Selleck.  Believe me.  I would play.  The Honeymooners.  Oh, that's right.  They're remaking.  They did.  Yeah, they should.  I actually refused to audition for that.  They offered me a small audition.  It was you and Cedric the Entertainer going up against each other.  Yeah, and I should know.  The black audience would probably recognize him more.  I'm humble about stuff like that. 
[03:11:30]  All right.  We should look.  All right, guys.  Thank you guys very much.  Thanks, man.  It's Minnie's First Time.  Check it out.  And I will come back.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks, man.  Once again, the website, Minnie'sFirstTimeTheMovie.com for more info.  But the movie sounds like it's going to be pretty interesting.  Definitely.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  We'll continue.  We're not part of regular radio, you fuckhead.  Anthony.  We take nothing.  And make shit out of it.  Okay, toss it.  Los muchachos con queso.  What a hot voice that is.  Wonderful.  Huevos grandes, como melones.  Ooh, ooh, ooh.  Robin.  Punch out, shithead. 
[03:12:00]  I'm a stick in the shoe.  Hey, there's not a can of mine.  Hey, there's not a can of mine.  May it have to stay and buy.  Take my life.  Oh.  I think that's AFI.  I think that's AFI.  Miss murder. 
[03:12:30]  I'm winging things across the studio.  Jimmy's back.  I'm eating tuna fish.  You know what's funny?  You can tune a piano, but you can't tuna fish.  Sometimes I pull that out of parties.  Feel free to use it.  Excuse me, that was an album title from REO Speedwagon.  Wow.  Faggot.  I was a rock jock. 
[03:13:00]  Wow.  I was a rock jock.  You were a cock jock, if you know that.  I was a rock jock, and I have a sour stomach today.  I have to text my good friend back.  Oh, I'm going to text too.  Hi.  There's no texting on live radio.  If he's texting, I'm texting.  Do you have a keyboard?  No.  Of course I do.  What am I, a faggot?  That's easy.  You'll take forever.  No, I don't.  I hate that texting thing.  I don't take forever. 
[03:13:30]  Just call.  Watch.  I know a lot of comedians have done that whole thing.  You got a phone.  Just call.  Wait.  I want to come see.  Got to press this key three times.  Should I spell see or just have the letter see?  I use letters and numbers all the time.  All right.  I'm going never T-O.  It's the number two.  See?  As in C-S-E-E. 
[03:14:00]  C-S-E-E.  Or S-E-E.  Oh, I just got a text.  Who is it from?  Jimmy Norton.  No, I'm not texting anybody.  I don't text.  Keith the Cop writes, hi, sweet abs.  Oh.  Mm-hmm.  But what happened to my, where did my other, but the one I was.  I want to know why the dorm is locked at night and on weekends. 
[03:14:30]  I have a sour stomach, though.  I, I, I.  Oh, you blasted something.  Oh, is that what that is?  I thought it was colon cancer.  You know the rule.  No camera on me.  Oh, shit.  No.  Don't, don't.  No, no, no.  Those are expensive cameras.  Oh, God.  Why no camera on you?  You're very handsome.  You're the best looking of the group.  Ah.  Now we, now we, now that camera's shot.  No, during the break I had sour stomach.  It sounded like I was starting up a motorboat.  And Anthony said it smelled like crude oil. 
[03:15:00]  It did.  It smelled like crude oil.  Ooh.  Are you getting a pay-go?  I'm eating tuna fish.  Okay, look.  I'm apologizing to the audience today.  Why are my cop friends writing stuff like high sexy and high sweet ass?  Texting and eating.  I'm eating tuna fish.  I got sour stomach.  It's the texting and eating show.  Oh, I got tuna all over the mic.  Oh.  Yeah, that'll come out. 
[03:15:30]  I don't care.  And not stink like fucking fish.  Somewhere around 8 a.m. I checked out.  Where's Craig?  I woke up with a little.  What happened?  A little sore throat.  Is that Craig?  And it's getting worse.  Oh, beautiful.  That's the actual Craig?  Yeah.  The Craig?  My idol.  Craig Newmark.  Why is he sweating?  Look at him there.  I'm not even thinking how much money he has in his pockets.  Fucking guy.  I love him.  Can you believe that?  From Craigslist.  I might hug him when he walks in.  From Craigslist.  Please do that.  We got...  There he is.  From Craigslist. 
[03:16:00]  A big hug.  He doesn't even...  You guys have never met him.  He just gave him...  I love him.  A nice big hug.  That's the greatest.  Let's go to Chris in New York before we move on here.  Chris?  Hey, Ed.  Those two other guys on vacation.  I just figured I'd call you because you're working by yourself today.  Oh, you want to just have a chat with me?  Yeah.  How are those...  How's Buddy doing in those rotten little kids?  They're not rotten kids.  They're just kids.  And kids will be children. 
[03:16:30]  They will be kids.  And I'm not into that whole thing.  That's not what you've been telling us.  I say they run...  I say they run around...  Jimmy, what does he say when the mics are off?  I say, Ant, how's it going?  He goes, well, the little pornographic models are doing okay.  You are a fucking ass.  I have never said that.  I kind of heard it like that myself.  A lot of bathtub photos.  I say...  I imagine someone's running around the big mansion right now trying to turn off all the  XM satellite radios.  I say...  Shut it off. 
[03:17:00]  You should just have a master switch in your house to turn off everything.  A big cartoon power switch.  No, what I do...  I've said that kids are constantly running around and never stop.  And parents are constantly going, stop it.  Put that down.  Don't do that.  Get over here.  Put this.  Go over there.  Go over here.  Get away from that.  Close that.  Open it.  And it's like, how does anybody look at that and go, that's what I want to do.  I want to be a parent.  I want to have fucking kids. 
[03:17:30]  When your whole existence is now keeping them from doing things or making them do things.  Excuse me.  It's insanity.  I know this is interesting stuff.  Of course it is.  But I just got a text message from my friend Tyson Walter.  Like my fucking story.  I'm telling a story and you're saying, oh, I'm glad that...  I know this is interesting stuff, but I'm going to read my fucking text message.  I love you too.  Oh, God damn rich cunt. 
[03:18:00]  Actually, Tyson.  Oh, God damn rich cunt.  Oh, God damn rich cunt.  Craig's a little directed at Craig.  Oh, God damn rich cunt.  Tyson writes, I feel jilted.  You never call me anymore.  And how about those Yankees?  Fuck your message.  You got one too?  Yes.  All right.  I got one.  It says, good morning, Führer.  And the other one says, Heil Hitler.  Oh, fuck.  So we have Craig.  Yes.  Hi, Craig. 
[03:18:30]  Craig, I want to apologize for the first five minutes of this interview.  Dude.  Did I throw up those quotation marks?  This is an amazing stat right here.  We all know Craigslist.  If you don't know Craigslist, I don't know what to tell you.  Jimmy uses it, uses Craigslist just about every day.  Well, maybe he doesn't want to talk about that part of Craigslist.  I use Craigslist a lot.  And somebody told me recently there is something on there other than services, therapeutic and  erotic.  Apparently, there are other uses for the site.  I've never actually seen them.  But you can do anything.  Actually, I think I found an apartment in L.A. on Craigslist. 
[03:19:00]  I mean, it was, it's.  Yep.  Everything.  All right.  How did you do it?  Basically, I didn't.  I just had one idea about, uh, about 11 years ago.  I was telling friends about what I thought were cool events in San Francisco, arts and  technology stuff.  Other people suggested things and I followed through.  A few years later, I made it into a real company, now led by this guy named Jim Buckmaster,  who, you know, who's really running things now. 
[03:19:30]  What are you, a figurehead?  Uh, my.  Namesake?  I tell people that I'm the glamorous figurehead, yes.  Yeah.  But I, I don't understand how you go from something like that, because everybody's had  a dopey idea for a website, to it making money and actually, you know, contributing to people's  lives.  Well, I prefer to have as few ideas as possible of my, of my own.  Uh, basically, people tell us what they need and what they want and we think about it.  We try to do what makes sense to people and we follow through and then we, uh, ask for 
[03:20:00]  more ideas.  Your site, it says, serves over 4 billion page views a month.  You're seventh overall, which I guess, in the world.  Jesus.  Behind Foundry Music and like six others.  Foundry.  And eatabullet.com.  What is ahead of you?  That, that's more interesting to me.  What is getting more than 4 billion?  Uh, let's guess.  I say Google.  I would say, uh, is AOL site count?  Yahoo.  Well, there are a bunch of sites ahead of us and ahead of us in a really, really big 
[03:20:30]  way.  There's a top echelons.  You look at the numbers.  Microsoft sites do, uh, do a considerably better.  Yahoo.  Bastard.  And now, uh, there are Chinese sites, which are beginning to do better and better.  Opie has been saying.  Uh, sir, the Chinese are coming.  The Chinese are coming.  Thank you.  That's been his, uh, his battle cry.  For a while now.  As far as technology goes.  And, uh, uh, using all, all the fuel.  Mm-hmm.  He's got a problem with the, um, Japanese, uh, Japanese, Chinese using all the, all the 
[03:21:00]  fuel.  I, I just have a problem with the Chinese.  The other Asian countries are fine in my book.  There's too many as far as, but they're, they're now, uh, using, uh,  They have access to Craigslist over there in China?  Uh, as far as we could tell, yeah.  Censored out.  One of those censored sites.  As far as we know, no censoring.  But, you know, we honestly, uh, don't know.  We only, right now, support English.  We're behind.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You know, I think the best part of Craigslist is not invasive.  Like, you don't get ads and shit unless, unless you say it's okay for them to contact 
[03:21:30]  you, which is great.  I mean, um, you put an ad out or you answer an ad.  Nobody fucks with you after that.  Nobody bothers you.  Believe me.  I've spent, my balls, thank you.  I've spent a lot of money on Craigslist.  See, now, a lot of people, uh, do legitimate, uh, transactions and things on Craigslist.  Most people.  They find apartments.  But what most people know about it, because it's made the most noise, is the sex angle.  The hooking up.  The, uh, the, um, uh, girls for hire.  Things that, that are considered quite illegal. 
[03:22:00]  Uh, how do you deal with that?  Well, most people go on the site for jobs or housing, but a lot of people are interested  in the, uh, personals, and some of them, uh, aren't legitimate.  Uh, we want to know about them.  We want to, uh, we do want to get rid of anything illegal on the site.  Yes.  But people tell us the priorities in that kind of stuff.  First should be things like scams, and in particular, New York.  Frankly, the thing I'm most concerned with are apartment brokers who aren't straight with 
[03:22:30]  people, particularly guys, uh, apartment brokers practicing bait and switch.  Yeah, because that makes the news a lot more than 14-year-old girl with a shovel over her  head.  Hey, hey, hey, he was working with us there.  I'm kidding, of course.  That happens on MySpace.  I'd actually rather see him after that than the sex stuff.  He should go after the apartment brokers.  He was working with us.  That was a code word.  Oh.  For prostitution.  Apartment broker is, uh, bait and switch.  You're an ex. 
[03:23:00]  Thinking you're getting a fine brand new apartment, and it's, uh.  And a hooker shows up.  Well, no, not necessarily.  You've got a broken down apartment.  Do you have any special Craigslist privileges because you're Craig?  You have to.  Uh, you think I would, but, uh, I don't have the, uh, I don't have the energy these days.  Like, I sold my last car on the site, that kind of thing.  Yeah.  And you see my address there, because, you know, my email address is craigslist.org, and  that's what I answer.  So if people see it there, they, uh, they know it's me. 
[03:23:30]  Sometimes they don't believe it.  They probably think it's another Craig.  Uh, could be, or they assume that Craig is just kind of some kind of general inbox at  the site.  You ever have, you ever had the cops, uh, come to you because of something that's happened  on Craigslist, or lawsuits, anything like that?  Not much in the way of lawsuits, but the idea is sometimes someone tries to run a small  scam, or let's say there's a little bit of harassment to the site.  Yeah.  Cases like that, we, uh, make that the high priority, uh, we help the cops go after the 
[03:24:00]  bad guys.  Sometimes.  Bad of files.  Yeah.  Well, sometimes when the cops, uh, don't know the, uh, forensics or the law involved, we'll,  uh, coach them.  Really?  Well, the idea is you gotta try to do the right thing.  Yeah.  Any, any, ever any guilt or anything?  You know, you would think that maybe, you know, if, if, uh, you hadn't have, uh, come  up with this, that's, somebody might still be alive, you know, or something like that,  or, uh, you know, cause, cause, uh, Craigslist has popped up in the news on a few occasions 
[03:24:30]  and some pretty notorious little things that have happened.  Uh, there's been some problems, uh, the cops and even DAs, even cops and DAs in New York tell  us we do a better job than they could expect us to do.  Really?  Yeah.  Policing yourself?  Well, mostly the people who use our site police it.  How much do you, cause I've seen, I'm gonna choke.  What are you having? 
[03:25:00]  Two and six.  I've seen people bashing at each other.  Yeah.  Like, really shit-talking.  How do they go after that?  Uh, if it gets to the point of harassment and it gets to our notice, we tell them to cut  it out.  And if, uh, you can't.  How about they print personal information about you?  If they put a personal information, uh, usually it's flagged away.  I mean, the people who use our site have a lot of power over it.  It's a flagging mechanism.  I've done that before.  Are you respected in the, uh, internet community? 
[03:25:30]  Do you go to events or meetings where a lot of these people, like, uh, the guy from MySpace  might be there or, you know, some other, and you, you, you, you mingle.  Um, people do seem to have, uh, they like us.  Are you looked upon like, you know, oh, that's Greg.  Uh, sometimes it's just a whole, uh, love-hate thing.  Yeah.  For example, among, uh, newspaper classifieds managers.  Right.  The deal there is that they like what we do, but if it's interfering with their business 
[03:26:00]  at all, uh, that they're not fond of.  Yeah.  Although the amount of, uh, the amount of business we take from their classifieds has  been exaggerated in a really big way.  Are you a millionaire from this site?  You are, right?  Uh, nothing like your thinking.  No, no.  Uh, the deal is that, well.  You could probably sell it for a lot.  Well, we could.  We could sell it for huge amounts of money.  I've been thinking about that a lot, and, uh, once you're living pretty comfortably, what's  the point of it?  Like, I know some of these big guys, uh, who have made, uh, some who are literal billionaires, 
[03:26:30]  and this guy's got to travel around with, uh, oh, with bodyguards.  Oh, my God.  You don't have to.  I don't have to.  I just took the subway here, which is, uh, how I prefer to travel in New York.  Really?  And that works for me.  You gotta watch out for sawzall guys that try to cut you up.  It's on the front page of the paper today.  I would never take the subway.  Do you use a sexy eyes on Craigslist?  No.  At this point, I've, after doing customer service, which is my full-time gig, after doing customer 
[03:27:00]  service for a lot of years, I've seen a lot of stuff on, like, erotic services, and at  this point, it gets just, it's just boring and pretty tedious.  What's your day-to-day operation, then?  Like, what do you do as far as, uh, as running this, if other people are pretty much running  in the ship, what do you do?  Uh, I get up, I do customer service.  You do customer service?  Uh, I'm part of a team that does customer service.  But if someone, like, calls and needs customer service, they might get you? 
[03:27:30]  Uh, if they email.  Oh, email.  The thing is, we do, we do limited phone support.  Right.  Most of it's, uh, via email.  And that works out, uh, pretty well.  And, and they'll get, like, you'll get back to them.  The Craig.  If it's sent to me, I'll either do it myself.  If I'm, uh, too busy, or if I'm, like, my way out the door, or in the case yesterday,  to the plane, I'll delegate it. 
[03:28:00]  Do a private plane?  No.  Only in my imagination.  All right.  That would be nice.  I'd fly continental only.  Youngest fleet, right?  No, actually.  That's what Jimmy tells me.  Jet blue.  Jet blue now?  Youngest fleet.  Mm-hmm.  But you ain't getting no first class.  You at least fly first class, right?  Uh, speaking of jet blue.  Let's say I've started indulging myself in business class.  Eh, it's not.  Okay, see?  Well, if I fly to Craig, dude.  Enjoy it while you can.  I would put out personals and just go, this is my list, motherfuckers.  You know why? 
[03:28:30]  Because I think this whole internet thing is a fad.  I think, uh, before you know it, we're going to go back to books.  That's what I've been telling you.  Phone books.  Things like that.  Uh, eight millimeter reels.  Stag films.  The good old days.  I'm sure that'll happen.  Yeah, sure it will.  Well, Craig Newmark.  I recommend Craig Newmark very highly.  I love it.  I sincerely do use it all the time.  He does.  I know.  We've talked about it for, uh, for years.  GFE, you know, um, BBBJ. 
[03:29:00]  GFE.  Yeah, you know what all these things are, right?  Of course he does.  Only, only a few these days.  I, uh, after you see too much, it all, uh, blurs together.  Do you have access to all the information?  Like, you could just go and see all the information?  B-O-R-E.  I could.  I, uh, right now for me it's just work.  It's just.  Could you hook me up?  Sure.  Could you hook me up?  I'm a big Craigslist user and I promote you guys all the time.  K-I-L-L.  Why?  You, you, why?  You want to.  I want the inside skinny.  You ain't getting shit. 
[03:29:30]  R-S-E-L-L.  And it ain't the skinny either.  Shoving your mouth like that.  I want.  There's mayo in there and everything.  F-A-T-U-L.  You're going to be a mess.  Spit that out.  B-A-L-L-E-E.  You bastard.  Well, anyway.  Opie.  Anyway.  Thank you, Craig.  Well, thanks, Craig.  For stopping in and giving us a little insight here on something everybody uses.  Craigslist.  I recommend Craigslist.  I highly recommend.  Hold on. 
[03:30:00]  I recommend that you use it.  I'm on it constantly.  Go up.  Go under erotic or go under therapeutic.  Or you can change apartments.  You can do whatever you want on this site.  Yeah.  And personal ads.  For free.  Yeah.  It's all free.  And they don't fuck you up.  One of the few sites like that.  And they don't try to get money out of you.  No.  And they don't contact you.  It's great.  It's just whoever can help each other out.  I like that.  Thanks, guys.  Appreciate it.  Thank you, Craig.  Very good. 
[03:30:30]  Thanks.  There we go.  Done with Craig.  Craig Newmark.  Excellent.  Thank you.  Iraq can show you.  I want a picture with Craig.  Thank you.  You want a picture there, Jimmy?  I certainly do.  Jimmy?  Yeah.  I want a picture with you, Craig.  That's good.  Yeah.  Get a what they call a snapshot.  I'm a volaturn.  Ah, it does.  Snapshot.  There it is.  I've heard of those snapshots.  Eh, snapchat.  Well, you know.  Back in the old days.  We used to call them that before it is digital age. 
[03:31:00]  Shut up.  I still say.  Thanks a lot.  It's a fad.  All right.  Yeah.  Thank you, buddy.  Take it easy, my friend.  Take care.  All right.  So long.  Craig?  Is, uh...  Craig...  Oh, my God.  Hold.  I asked for...  I asked for fucking pretzels an hour ago.  Yeah.  Is the sound off?  What happened?  Is he, um...  What happened? 
[03:31:30]  Why would he be on his way out?  Jesus Christ.  What happened?  That was the most difficult interview I've ever conducted.  I was trying not to laugh during the whole thing.  I'm just trying to work on...  I bit my tongue three times trying not to.  I'm just trying to work on new bits.  I'm just trying to come up with a new bit.  Who got me pretzels?  Jimmy asking questions with a mouth fucking full of tuna.  I didn't want to fuck with him. 
[03:32:00]  He seemed like a nice guy, but it wasn't a little slow going.  Jeff, what's up?  Hall of Fame, Opie.  Hall of Fame.  I heard about the first five minutes of that nice, soft, torn voice he had when he started  talking about his boss, Mr. Buttmaster, and that's about when you started cutting in,  and I laughed.  I didn't hear a word after that.  Awesome.  I started spelling at the end.  Oh, yeah.  And as I was spelling uncomfortable words, Anthony would get louder and louder. 
[03:32:30]  I know.  I was hoping you were going to give a plug for F.H. Riley's.  Oh, I should have.  There you go.  Oh, awesome.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Thanks.  Yeah, we'll be at F.H. Riley's all weekend long, some of us from the fine radio show,  my brother's restaurant there in Huntington, 400 New York Avenue.  Look at Josh.  What the fuck?  What the fuck is Anthony doing?  Trying to conduct an interview, Josh.  I believe you had the wrong party.  Here's what you do, Josh.  Anthony was playing the straight man. 
[03:33:00]  Someone thought Terry Schiavo was in the studio.  Colin, what's up?  Hey, were you taking a shit?  I wanted to.  Yeah, he had nothing to do with Craigslist.  It sounded like you were taking a...  And he didn't want to talk about the prostitution thing.  The dirty stuff.  The dirty stuff.  We like the dirty stuff.  Yeah.  He's trying to claim that they're trying to get that stuff off. 
[03:33:30]  No, whatever.  I'm just pinching my helmet.  Let's go to Matt in Massachusetts.  What else is there?  O.P., you madman.  I was laughing so hard, I swallowed my fucking gum.  Oh, thank you, sir.  You know the best time to swallow your gum right when you fucking got a girl that you  can't believe is actually going to let you eat her pussy,  and you don't want to take the time and break the mood and put your gum on the nightstand,  so you've got to swallow it.  Swallow it.  Let's go to Craig.  Well, no, we were talking to Craig.  Let's go to Turtle from Whack Bag.  Turtle?  Hey, guys. 
[03:34:00]  Craig is a horribly boring ass, and O.P., you are a genius.  I really wish I would have had the guts to not be in studio and call in.  God damn it.  No, we went different that time.  No, I know, but I just wish that for the love of all, I don't know.  I was looking at Jimmy for approval.  I wouldn't look at you because I was going to laugh.  I wouldn't look at you.  I saw you started to smirk a little bit.  It got too loud.  It got too loud, and like O said, my questions got louder.  Every time O.P. got louder, my questions got louder, 
[03:34:30]  and then I looked over at O.P. and started laughing.  Well, the line that got me to really laugh is when he said,  besides bore people to death.  I also spelled out kill yourself.  Yeah, the spelling at the end was a little much.  Well, this always comes up after something like this that just happened.  Token Jew, what's up?  Well, it's been happening. 
[03:35:00]  Dude, that guy was boring as a motherfucker,  but I got to say, it's hard for you guys to get guests  if you're going to be a complete ass to everybody that comes in, dude.  We're not asses to everybody.  See, all of a sudden, it's everybody.  Weren't we nice to Joel McHale from The Soup?  80% of your guests are just a complete ass.  No, we're not.  You are so wrong.  The only guys recently would be this guy who they were just being silly with  and the author who was lying.  Yeah, the author was lying.  That's it.  Here's the deal.  If the guest deserves it, then he gets it. 
[03:35:30]  Get us a month's worth of guests.  Get us a list of a month's worth of the guests we've had on this show.  We weren't sure which direction the director thing was going to go in,  and it turned out to be a nice little interview.  Nothing too exciting that we're going to replay.  Who else, sir?  I can't even fucking look over at Jimmy.  Why?  Look at, look.  Who cares?  Why do you got a hard-on?  I told you I was pinching it.  He's got a fucking bulge in his hand.  It's not a full hard-on.  Who doesn't?  Oh, God.  Don't even pay attention to it. 
[03:36:00]  So what guests...  Don't even pay attention.  It's not worth looking at.  That's kind of hurt, dude.  No, I just bent a little bit.  It's like a little bit better.  Ow, he's bending it in half.  No, no, it's bending back towards me like that.  Go ahead.  So what will you start?  I can make bat wings.  What guests, sir?  Where's the guy?  Is he gone?  You need foul talk today.  There's a guy in my neighborhood that sells books and looks just like that.  Oh, he has big balls.  I pointed out to Jimmy one day. 
[03:36:30]  Blake in Illinois, what's up?  Yeah, I just want to comment about the shit dick last week that said that we don't need Opie.  Fuck you.  You rule, Opie.  Yeah, I had a good day of radio, and I had a good one-liner, too,  about we threw one back.  Yes.  Yes.  That got a good laugh, too, so I did two good things.  Sally in Chicago.  Look for that in the replay.  The only interview I ever heard you guys do that was worse was that one with that mood elevator drug doctor.  What was it?  God, we replayed that recently.  I forgot how great that was. 
[03:37:00]  That's all.  Bye.  All right.  Thank you.  Cindy Williams, Gayron, and we guys having rules.  Let's say hi to Harrison Green.  Harrison Green.  Harrison Green?  What's up, Harrison?  Hey, dude, I got to tell you, don't listen to these country bomb motherfuckers.  You're fucking awesome.  Every interview you do...  What's he doing?  Why are you doing that voice?  Why is the voice...  Harrison.  Why are you doing that silly voice?  What are you doing?  You want to know why, in all honesty? 
[03:37:30]  Okay.  Why?  Okay.  Why?  In all honesty, it's been like this for four years.  Really?  Why?  I have no idea.  I've gone to seven different doctors.  Shut up.  You're trying so hard to make this bit work.  Your bit isn't working, guy.  Sir.  Sir.  Your bit...  Why are you doing the voice?  Just tell us.  I'm not doing this for you.  Just tell us.  Stop, Harrison. 
[03:38:00]  Come on, Tara Reid.  Why?  It's taking so much effort for you to even do it.  Listen.  He goes, listen.  I guarantee if we keep him on the phone, he'll crack.  He'll crack.  He's got him.  Why are you doing the voice?  I'm not doing this voice.  It's been like this for four years.  I'm dead serious.  What happened?  Where are you from?  I'm from Maryland.  Well, how'd your voice just go like a kablooey?  Well, one of the doctors said it's a thing called spasmodic dysphonia. 
[03:38:30]  I don't even know where to begin with that shit.  Speaking of dysphonia.  Yeah.  All right, Harrison.  We know you.  Your bit is awful.  Yeah.  We enjoy when a new bit is spawned, but it's not going to happen today.  Call back with a better bit.  That's right.  Remember one time Opie asked for characters, and I shot one right out.  Right.  And I got a new character now, too.  What is it?  That thing I just did.  Is that going to be my head thing?  Well, it's going to be my new thing.  Maybe not a character.  Is that a character, though?  That's not a character.  I don't think that's a character. 
[03:39:00]  That's not really a character.  I think that's one of the most annoying sounds I've ever heard come out of a human being.  It's not a character, though.  That'll give it.  It's not a character.  I came up with a couple new things today.  It's like the grudge.  A couple new bits that Jimmy can steal.  No, I won't steal any bits.  What about the, ha, ha, you're homeless?  You do that just walking down the street?  Oh, yeah.  When we're not on the radio?  Uh, Joe, no, no.  No, no.  No, Opie does that. 
[03:39:30]  Opie, right.  Opie is actually, and this is Jim Norton.  I play the, uh, I'm the actor who plays Jimmy Norton.  That's a great bit.  Yeah, thank you.  This is Notice Me Guy.  I'm just going to talk like this.  I'm going to be noticed.  I've had a voice problem like this for four years now.  I'm going to be steal the bit that didn't work, Guy.  I'm going to be keep a bit that no one's paying attention to, Guy, going. 
[03:40:00]  You're waiting for us to say who you're trying to do.  No, keep a character that nobody will acknowledge going, Guy.  All right, Joe from Glendale.  Joe from Glendale.  Hey, you know what one of these interns should be?  Bring me the fucking pretzels, Guy.  Joe from Glendale.  Because right now, I'm hungry, Guy.  Joe from Glendale.  I can't wait to see spitting the pretzels, Intern.  Oh, I know that's coming, believe me.  Ooh, we got a bit.  What's the bit that we have? 
[03:40:30]  I'm doing a character now.  It's called doesn't know when to let it go, Guy.  I don't know.  All right, here we go.  We should all talk like that.  We'll do it the whole rest of the show.  We will really annoy the listeners.  I'm going to try to get a really deep...  That's good, okay.  There's really no way to argue like this.  You're a cunt.  Go fuck yourself.  I don't appreciate that.  Joe?  Yes?  I want my compliment.  Opie, you've been on fire lately, and it just goes to show how great Jimmy Norton is. 
[03:41:00]  Thank you, sir.  But I thought this was my comment.  Oh, boy.  We have a disgruntled person.  Yes, we do.  Someone is angry.  I have no comment.  Wow.  Someone's angry.  What's this about?  This is about the IMAX contest we had.  We gave away five IMAX today.  Five IMAX.  We had entries that were sent in. 
[03:41:30]  We wanted show production.  We wanted you to come up with some production piece about the Opie and Anthony show.  And it was whittled down to, we heard ten of them, and the top five out of those ten won IMAX.  Congratulations.  It didn't take long before an email of grave disappointment and anger came in from I Gather.  Is this a contestant?  Indeed it is.  A four-time contestant. 
[03:42:00]  Oh, and is he, do you have his work?  We certainly do.  Okay.  First, let's read the letter.  And first of all, I would like to say you should not have CC'd me on this.  If you notice, I was out of the contest completely.  You should not have CC'd me.  Why were you out of the contest?  No reason.  Just...  You didn't want to...  He was a little angry.  Yeah.  He was a little angry, and well, he should be.  Oh, you were making a stand.  No, just not going to.  You were.  I actually wouldn't have ever mentioned it again if this didn't come in with my CC on it. 
[03:42:30]  Well, he should be.  He didn't get an IMAX.  Nope.  So he wasn't going to participate.  And he should be.  I wasn't going to smash them, but why would I plug a company?  That's spit on me.  Spit on Jimmy.  All right.  Here's the email.  Why did you even have a contest?  Why not just give all the friends of the show a fucking computer and save everyone else  the trouble of thinking that it was an actual contest?  I'll agree with that.  I'll editorialize here for a moment.  The friends that won happened to contribute very good production, which was the basis of 
[03:43:00]  the contest.  They are not paid employees of this program.  They aren't friends or family of this program.  They are listeners that contribute stuff to this program.  They contributed production that was worthy of them winning.  That's what happened.  They also contributed.  If a lot of people would have, more people would have contributed, it would have been more 
[03:43:30]  to a judge.  Maybe better ones.  Quite frankly, it was a lame contest.  We didn't have enough time.  That should have been a contest that took at least a month.  Right.  We would have got some amazing production pieces.  But it was a thing they threw together over there, and they wanted to do it in a week,  and we were able to get two weeks out of the contest, which means the quality went up a  little bit.  So here's what we have.  I dare you to put up a poll with the four entries I sent in, and I guarantee that they  are all voted above your top ten. 
[03:44:00]  Not one of them is even memorable.  This guy is so pissed that he's, I can agree with like a couple of them really stunk, but  it's all subjective.  A couple of them stunk, but to say that all ten of them, none of them memorable, I'll bet  you guys didn't even listen to half the entries.  I disagree with that wholeheartedly.  I didn't listen to one. 
[03:44:30]  Because we didn't really believe in the contest.  It was a sales-driven contest with rules, and we can't just, the guys, ah, whatever.  Because now we have to get serious.  We've been having fun being silly for the last time.  I actually did listen to a lot of them online.  We did listen to a lot of them.  There were a lot of people that contributed, that posted on message boards and stuff before  they got here.  This dummy doesn't realize we can't just hand IMAX to our friends.  That's not what I mean.  We were getting in a lot of trouble for that.  Right.  I bet you guys didn't even listen to half the entries.  You took the ones sent in by your friends of the show, threw them in the top ten, then 
[03:45:00]  pulled a few out of the masses to get a top ten.  Out of the top ten, I've met one of those people, Drew Boogie.  Drew Boogie.  Maybe I met another one of these people, but it wasn't memorable, obviously, or I would  have remembered.  Chemistry.  I remember we were talking before the contest about how we got to get chemistry won.  Right.  Yeah, absolutely.  Because he's done a lot of hard work for the show.  Oh, yeah, I guess you're right about that, then.  Quite frankly, I love chemistry.  Like him as a person.  I don't like his stuff, quite frankly, particularly. 
[03:45:30]  No?  I don't find it very good.  Why, quite frankly, don't you like his stuff?  His oldest stuff is much better.  He used to do a lot more impressions back in the old days.  He was funnier.  Oh, wait, that's me.  What did you say?  Be who?  Be frank.  Do you know that I think that whenever you do something,  somebody's not going to be happy?  That's not Frank the Frowner.  It certainly is.  Don't tell me who I am.  I'm chewing. 
[03:46:00]  I'm Frank the Frowner.  You're not Frank the Frowner.  You're asking the thief.  You're taking my name.  Aren't the...  It takes more muscles to frown than it does to rig a contest?  I was once told by a company that snubs me.  Here we go.  Aren't the fans of the show a little more important? 
[03:46:30]  No.  To say the fix was in doesn't even do justice to what just happened.  Hey, hey, jackass, listen to this.  The fix was in?  Jesus.  The fan...  I know.  Yeah, Muggsy.  Was the fix in?  Meh.  See?  What are you, the boxing commissioner and raging ball?  A lot of people think you're on the take.  The fix is in.  Here's what you don't really understand about radio.  Go.  Most people aren't going to send in anything.  They're listeners.  The fans that you point out, aren't the fans of the show a little more important? 
[03:47:00]  Those fans don't send in anything.  They listen to the fucking show.  They want to hear something entertaining on a daily basis.  What they heard were contributions.  Most of them funny.  Some of them stunk.  I understand that.  Again, all subjective.  But we're here to entertain them, not give away free computers.  That's a perk.  And we gave them away to what the judges felt were the best production that was sent in.  Not friends, jerk off. 
[03:47:30]  You should have called this a lottery because that's about what it was.  Half the entries didn't even promote the show, for Christ's sake.  Whoever judged this piece of shit should be ashamed of themselves, okay?  Finally a point we can agree upon.  But not for this contest, but for their other lack of work on this program.  Right.  Who judged it?  Now that...  And here we go.  Here we go.  Now that O&A got their money, I bet they didn't have the time to judge this lowly contest. 
[03:48:00]  Go fuck your mother.  More like...  Go take your mother, and if she's dead, dig her up and stick your fucking cock in her shriveled dead ass.  You fucking dick.  Yeah, we took our money and said, fuck the contest.  Well, go shit in your fucking hat.  Well, he...  Go shit in your hat.  Nice talk for your mother.  You know, I know Jimmy has issues, and that's fine with Apple and stuff because of the computer. 
[03:48:30]  I use iMac.  I love using it.  It's a lot of fun.  I put together production pieces.  I'm savvy.  I know what the fucking deal is with computers and with production and what it takes and what we find funny, what the judges find funny.  This isn't about...  What do you think?  Like, I fucking went into a conference room and grabbed an envelope full of money and ran out.  Okay, I did.  But it has nothing to do...  And this guy just doesn't know Anthony at all.  Anthony doesn't care about anybody else. 
[03:49:00]  Right.  No one.  So why would he be handing out iMacs to, quote, friends of the show?  To friends?  I don't even fucking hang out with these people.  Friends.  And then he ends it with, you know, because...  The guy is implicating...  He's making these things...  Now that they got their money, I bet they didn't have time to judge this lowly.  More like Howard every day.  BG, owner and CEO.  Owner and CEO. 
[03:49:30]  Get that website up there, by the way, before Anthony says it, because, you know, that's what happened.  All right, hold on.  I'm sorry.  I just got this weird feeling.  Did you guys make this letter up?  Okay.  Because that really would have been fucking funny.  You assholes.  I saw some laughing going on, and I got, like, cold and sweaty.  I went like, oh, my God, I'm the brunt of a joke.  Okay.  D.  D.C.  Fnatic.com.  It's a website. 
[03:50:00]  D.C.  Fnatic.com.  He's the owner and CEO.  B.G.  I'm guessing it stands for Dallas Cowboys.  Oh, yeah.  I was thinking D.C.  Washington myself.  But I was wrong.  Yeah, it's Dallas Cowboys.  If we had a hundred to give away, and he was a hundred and first, we would have gotten  the same one.  A thousand, and he was a thousand and one.  Same angry letter. 
[03:50:30]  Two million four hundred twenty-five thousand eight hundred and seventy-two.  Now you come up with one more than that.  Perhaps.  How about roundabout figure?  Why don't we hear some of his stuff?  All right, we got him.  Let's hear and give it.  Let's be honest.  I will.  I want honesty from Pal Talk.  I'm putting both screens up.  Pal Talk and instant feedback.  No bullshit, people.  I want honesty.  Listen to this, and let's see.  He wanted a poll, so we'll get a little impromptu poll from our listeners. 
[03:51:00]  If he's good, don't say he sucks because you're annoyed at him.  Be really honest.  Yeah, oh, believe me, we're fucking annoyed at him, but if he's an idiot savant, he's  already proved the idiot part, let's hear your savant ass.  Yeah, here we go.  His first entry, he sent in four.  What's his name?  B.G.?  B.G., owner and CEO of DCFanatic.com.  I want to be a CEO. 
[03:51:30]  Me too.  You are.  I am?  Yeah.  Yes, you're a cute, edible opie.  Eww.  Ink.  Yeah, yeah, just read what's on me.  You got it, A-Rock.  Hey, this is the number one 08 pet, Stan from Yellowbone.  Make sure you listen to Open an E and Anthony with special guest Ed Norton.  That guy from the Honeymooners, he's still alive?  All right, all right.  So make sure you listen every weekend from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. on 3 a.m. and X-ray satellite 
[03:52:00]  radios.  What is this, a science show?  Open an E and Anthony.  The disease is spreading.  All right, so that's it.  So when do I get my free Big Mac?  All right.  All right.  Look.  B.G.  That was worse than I was hoping for.  I was hoping.  Let me be honest with you.  I was hoping it was going to be bad.  If it was going to be good, I was going to be really mad, but then I'd have to say it  was good.  I was hoping it was going to be bad. 
[03:52:30]  That was so much worse than I even hoped for.  I disagree.  I think it was funny.  Shut the fuck up.  You did not.  That was very good because it was like the whole opening Anthony thing.  That was...  It's...  I...  Well, let's see the instant feedback.  Let's check out another one.  I think this guy's good.  And on it.  Sucks.  What the fuck was that?  This shit sucks.  You guys just...  Too bad to even be funny.  Worst ever.  Fucking retard. 
[03:53:00]  Sucks fat cock.  Sucks gorilla cock.  Sucks ass.  That sucks Baba Booey dick.  College radio.  Steve C. made that as a joke.  Very average.  So, Mr. Rachi Gay.  Go back into Stern's ass.  That's terrible.  This sucks my cock.  Give me the Heimlich.  Did I just fart?  I have to take the shit.  Plate full of donkey sausage.  Sucks everyone's fucking cock.  One after another.  I'm just reading these.  Very mixed.  Very mixed.  Very mixed. 
[03:53:30]  Ramone, get me a shotgun.  Where's the other ones?  What was that?  Blech.  What's that one?  Sucks dirty assholes.  The background noise is fucking annoying.  I don't really get it.  Sucks balls.  Total car crash.  All right.  Well, that was his first entry.  Maybe that was his worst entry.  Imagine that.  The official contest rules state that you're allowed one entry per email.  Right.  So, he sent all these in with the same one.  Uh-huh.  So, I listened to his first one, which was that.  Yep.  And the other ones, I didn't even look at, because he was violating contest rules. 
[03:54:00]  So, it could be.  No, I'm not saying that.  I'm not going to say they're brilliant.  Believe me.  Your contest rules are one per email, so you gave him one.  But what if number three was good?  Let's hear another, my friend.  Here's number two.  Here's number two.  BG.  And again, even though number one was a fucking abortion.  A fucking abortion.  Let's be open-minded.  Number two might be good.  Stephen Yellowstone, 202 News. 
[03:54:30]  Here outside Opie and Anthony's studios in New York with a fan.  Son, why such a big fan of the Opie and Anthony show?  Because, bro, all the motherships are out there.  Get it.  We're their whores.  We're their whores.  We're their whores.  A few more Johns that want our fine asses.  They want our fine asses.  Because we're still young and sweet.  So weak.  Supple.  Supple.  We're still supple.  And then we're good.  We do it all.  Do it all.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Spreading the virus.  No homo. 
[03:55:00]  I think the important thing out of that one, besides the fucking nightmarish job he did,  was that Gnarles Barkley song, fucking Kicks Ass Crazy, is one of the best songs I've heard in years.  Anyone familiar with that?  So you're insulted.  What song is that?  That song in the background, Gnarles Barkley Crazy.  Do we have any of that?  That's fucking fantastic.  And I hate new music.  You actually know a new song?  Wow.  I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind.  There was something so pleasant about that place. 
[03:55:30]  Even your emotions have an echo.  And so much fun.  I sent Gnarles and iMac just to piss this idiot off.  You like this, right?  And when you're out there, without care.  Yeah, I was out of love.  I bet Earl likes this.  This is great.  Very funky.  A lot of soul.  Earl, Earl likes this?  Of course he does.  I like this, too.  Black, you know, Earl.  I thought I'd point that out.  I want to hear the hug.  Here comes the hug.  Does that make me crazy? 
[03:56:00]  Does that make me crazy?  You could get your fucking fuck on to this.  Yeah.  Get your fuck on.  That's good, because this kind of cleanses the palate from the shit sandwich we just ate,  courtesy of BG, owner and CEO of DCFanatic.com.  Oh, shit.  From the shit sandwich he just sent us.  Yes, Timmy? 
[03:56:30]  What?  What are you doing?  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Timmy just pulled his pants down and danced.  Oh, shit.  All right.  The reviews are coming in better.  The second one, I'll give mine first.  Better than first, but still sucks.  Not as bad as the first one, but the first one was so incredibly bad, that doesn't mean  anything.  And as far as, like, cracking the top ten, eat me. 
[03:57:00]  That stinks.  Peter from Long Island, he's suggesting that we dump it overboard and hope it never comes  back.  Did they like the Norris Barkley song?  Of course.  Yeah, they did.  I hope people let them buy that.  I've laughed more at a post-rape examination.  That's not saying much.  That's...  From our listeners.  They can say that after fucking the greatest comedy ever.  Owner and CEO of my ass is what Bert from Philly says.  Wow. 
[03:57:30]  All right.  Well, come on.  This guy...  This guy should be given more of a chance than anyone else.  Anyone else.  Give him two more fucking shots.  All right.  Here's the third one.  Let's hear number three from this genius.  King Norton.  Oh, King Norton.  King Norton.  Can I please have your autograph?  It's me, Derek Cheater from the New York Yankees.  Yankees.  Yankees.  Yankees. 
[03:58:00]  Rise and shine, King Jimmy.  You have a show to do, big boy.  Wake up with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Every weekday morning at 6 on Free FM Radio.  Holy fucking cunt.  You suck so bad I can't even convey.  Get him on the phone.  Please, get him in the studio. 
[03:58:30]  Get him on the phone.  Holy shit.  You know what I want to do?  I'm going to bring in my iMac.  I want him here.  And I want to beat him over the head with it.  And then he can have the pieces.  Does DC stand for Deuce Chills?  That's Jimmy from Wackers.  Very good.  Deucechillsfanatic.com.  Attaboy, Jimmy.  Owner and CEO.  Wow.  Wow.  What happened? 
[03:59:00]  Unbelievably bad.  Oh.  Steve has an opinion?  Steve, what did you think of that?  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Yes, yes.  I'm sure.  Bob, Kelly, what did you think?  Oh, he doesn't like it at all.  Please tell me Steve has something else to say.  What are you doing in my house?  Why is this guy in Steve's house? 
[03:59:30]  What's my problem?  You're in my fucking house.  No, nothing's wrong.  Just stay in the living room.  I'll handle it.  I'll be so...  Get the fuck out.  Now.  That's what his acting teacher said when he walked in a class.  Why not?  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  That's how you asked?  Listen to that one again.  Hold on, hold on.  Emotion.  How'd your parents die? 
[04:00:00]  How'd your parents die?  How'd your parents die?  How'd your parents die?  How'd your parents die?  How'd your parents die?  We should make Steve and Wild Bill do a one-act play during the...  Oh, please.  The traveling O&A virus.  Don't worry, the O&A traveling virus.  They should have to reenact it.  That's terrible.  Now that O&A's got their money, I bet they didn't have time to judge this lowly contest.  More like Howard every day.  Yeah, play in this shit. 
[04:00:30]  Play in your crap.  You suck so fucking bad.  Holy Jesus, are you awful.  Well, let's go to the phones and say hi to fuck sauce.  Fuck sauce.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, fuck sauce.  We called DC, by the way, and it went to voicemail.  Of course it did.  So DC, if you're listening, why don't you pick up your phone?  We'll try again in a couple minutes, all right?  If this guy was gang-raped by talent, he'd still suck cocky.  Turn it off. 
[04:01:00]  I like the gang-raped by talent part.  There's something there.  Let's go to Jason the trucker.  Jason?  Hey, I understand, you know, everything's going on here, but Howard, you're doing pretty good by yourself.  I don't know why you got this other guy.  What's his name?  Opie?  And this guy in the background, Jim?  Jimmy or whatever, James?  He's trying.  Why in the world are you running with them, Howard?  I mean, I've listened to you for a long time, but I just got this new service for you. 
[04:01:30]  Ladies and gentlemen, McCall is trying out a new character.  Let's see if it's working.  I don't know.  Really.  What was your character?  I've heard you so much, and I really like you, Howard, but, you know, you really don't need...  He's throwing in the name.  You stand alone on your own, really.  Jason, what's your character?  We don't know.  Yeah.  What are you talking about?  Is your character a guy who should fuck his mother?  Is that your character, Cornwall? 
[04:02:00]  I don't understand your character.  Call us when it's better defined.  Sonny Ferrelli, live from Boston.  Yeah, where's my fucking goddamn iMac?  I'm a fucking friend of the show.  God damn it.  I feel fucking left out.  You should have been, like, front of the line.  Pat from Munaki should have been trying to eat one.  All our friends should have gotten them.  I feel all fucking left out now.  You guys aren't my friends anymore.  No, I guess we're not.  You would have had a computer. 
[04:02:30]  God damn it.  I want to hear now the final entry of four that this talentless piece of crap has sent  in saying that it was better than all ten, never mind just the winners, everything that  was heard today.  And could you guys queue up my favorite one?  Yeah, but I want the tag now if we haven't done this stuff.  Oh, yeah.  Damn, where'd that bitch go to get this stuff?  I don't know, but I'm feeling real bad right now.  She better hurry up.  I can't take it no more. 
[04:03:00]  Yo, I hope this is her coming right now.  I'm back.  What took you so long, bitch?  Y'all don't even know what I had to go do to get this crack.  Crack?  Who said anything about crack?  You were supposed to give us the O.P. and Anthony show.  That's stupid, bitch.  Now, just calm down, guys.  Just calm down.  You'll be there to the show.  I need to find him.  Free of air radio.  That's funny.  I like it.  Shut the fuck up.  Shut up, Jimmy.  I am beyond pissed. 
[04:03:30]  Listening to that just angered me.  That one could be worse than the first one.  Which was worse than the second one.  Can I steal your bit?  Give me that fucking CD.  Wait, let me think about it.  I want to steal your bit.  All right, you can steal my bit today.  You're in my fucking house.  Here you go.  Just make sure people know it's my bit.  Ladies and gentlemen, I will be performing O.P.'s bit.  Thank you, Anthony.  Jimmy doesn't give me credit when he steals my bits. 
[04:04:00]  I don't take your bits.  But Anthony gives me credit.  Wait, set it up better.  Wow, this is really good.  No, no, I'm serious.  I think...  Didn't we steal that from an intern, to be honest with you, at A.M.?  I think we did.  Brian?  Brian.  Yeah, a little Brian.  Wow, this is really good.  I think we should...  No, really, I think we should put this away somewhere.  And we'll play it again.  This guy's really talented.  We'll play it again a lot of times. 
[04:04:30]  I think when we go away, it should definitely be on our best of.  It's really good.  What's the guy's name?  B.G.  B.G., great job, great job.  Let me file this, Mick.  You suck!  You can't even break it.  There you go.  Hey, dog.  Did you see a fucking CD come apart like that?  Hey, hey.  It's how the CEO laughs.  That's how the CEO laughs. 
[04:05:00]  Hey, I don't do voices at the end of my bits.  I threw in a little bit of Anthony.  I made it my own.  Oh, all right.  Very good.  I like that.  All right.  Oh, you suck.  And that's all the time I'm giving you.  Attaboy it.  How does it feel that this entry beat all four of yours, B.G.?  That's not too annoying at all. 
[04:05:30]  That guy has an IMAX shithead.  That should be in a horror movie, man.  That is so annoying.  The final scene in a horror movie when you thought you got rid of the nuisance.  But that guy who sent it in, what was his name? 
[04:06:00]  Charles.  Charles, yeah.  You know what?  He won.  Is there any way to...  He won an IMAX.  Well, we give him out requests from time to time.  Someone has to put that to animation.  Wow.  Like one little Jimmy goat comes in?  Well, this is what I picture.  Like, it's a close-up of Jimmy doing it.  Oh, right.  And then it pans out slowly to just show you more and more and more.  Oh, that's good.  I'm in a fun house, and I'm looking at all the fun house mirrors, and I can't stop it. 
[04:06:30]  No, we don't do...  Oh, that's my...  That's my...  But that's my vision.  Someone else might have a different vision.  Can I do it?  So far, no.  Go ahead.  No, I won't even try now.  Try it.  No, you don't want me to.  I do actually, but I don't think you can do it.  No.  No.  It was too nasally.  Yeah.  I felt it was too nasally.  That's kind of sounding like Gallagher, too.  Fuck.  Almost had it.  I'm swallowing some water.  I won't try that again. 
[04:07:00]  Yeah.  You get almost a pelican resonance in the throat.  It's an hour and 22 minutes, though?  No, I think it's...  What?  Oh, Jesus.  What?  I don't mind doing a little extra radio, but don't hand it an hour and 22 minute pitch.  Extra radio?  Wouldn't we have to have given people radio before we give them extra?  This fucking show today.  One minute.  Okay.  Jesus.  This show stands on its own.  I'll apologize. 
[04:07:30]  I've been a little sad and I'm a little tired.  I haven't been very good today.  No.  And I'll...  You've been a lamb.  And I'll apologize because I woke up with a scratchy throat.  No, I hope you're okay in a sour stomach.  And I've tried my best to transcend.  By the way, can I...  And be a professional.  Of course.  And I've failed miserably.  By the way, I got to bring a very uncomfortable moment to the show.  So this isn't Opie talking.  No, it has to be.  It's an uncomfortable moment.  Oh, for the show.  Who's addressing the audience? 
[04:08:00]  This happened to Greg Hughes, the actor that plays Opie from the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, yes.  Right?  I don't like to talk about Greg Hughes too often.  So consider this a privilege today.  Considered.  So we all go see...  We all go to see Clerks 2.  And I want some honest answers.  No, and nothing about the movie.  I did like the movie.  I really did.  And I think the guys are coming in next week.  And nothing about that.  So the movie lets out.  We had a beautiful screening room. 
[04:08:30]  Like something you could picture.  And maybe Anthony's home.  Ah.  Because you were good.  Because unlike...  Were there Nazi flags hanging up?  Just a beautiful place to see a movie.  Yeah.  It's like a mini theater.  It had what?  80 seats maybe?  Yeah, 88 seats.  80 seats.  Yeah, mine's got 90.  I couldn't go.  I was falling in love.  Have you ever seen a movie like that?  No.  In a screening room?  In a movie like that.  That's the only way to go.  Screw going to these big theaters, man.  You got to see more.  That's the way the Usher laughs.  So...  Usher, what year is this?  That's very funny, though.  You idiot.  You ever see Juju Beats come apart like that? 
[04:09:00]  Go to the assistant to the assistant manager.  So the movie lets out.  And I was holding in a crap.  All movie.  All movie.  All movie, man.  All.  And I ran into the bathroom.  And the bathroom was the size of what?  Seriously, that room?  It was small.  It had two toilets.  One urinal and one stall.  Oh, that's what it was in there?  Yeah.  One of those.  So...  Local dive bar bathroom. 
[04:09:30]  So I run in there, and I just let loose.  Just let loose of three days of goodness.  You haven't shit in three days?  I don't know.  Wow.  Some comes out of here in there.  Dude, I shit twice a day.  Well, when I was on vacation, I was back to being regular.  Sometimes while I'm eating.  That's some review you gave the movie.  Jesus.  Great movie.  I took a nice three-day shit.  Oh, God.  So...  Movie.  So stupid me.  I'm like, what are the odds that everyone else needs to use the bathroom after the movie 
[04:10:00]  let out two hours later?  Oh, boy.  So I'm in the stall, and I am laying pipe, man.  Just over and over.  I mean, it is piling up, man.  Remember those coming out like a Carvel?  Remember those plastic rings you used to have as a kid?  It started out with a big ring, and by the top, it was a small ring.  I was proud of the pyramid I was building, man.  Okay.  We get it.  It was a big shit. 
[04:10:30]  A big doody.  And the room was really small, and usually not much of a problem, but I'm smelling it.  I'm like, what the fuck is this?  No.  There are times you take a dump, you don't smell your own crap anyway, and I'm like,  oh, man, how embarrassing would it be?  And I'm thinking this to myself, as the door opens and everyone piles into this tiny bathroom.  Oh, no.  E-Rock's friends.  Who else was in there?  Tham?  Oh, no.  Yeah, it was me and three other guys.  Three of E-Rock's. 
[04:11:00]  Did you smell it?  Actually, I'm sorry to be the guy, but it wasn't as horrific as you're painting it.  All right.  Wow.  But it was great as you sort of, I'd rather you be honest instead of, like, you know,  faking for the radio.  So it wasn't that bad, really?  It wasn't.  I walked out going, oh, my God.  Why'd you go in with three guys into a bathroom with one stall and one shoulder?  It felt like I waited for them to go in, and I was like, now's my chance.  I just went.  It was behind several doors.  And I got there, and I was like, I could wait.  And then I saw little shoes underneath the stall.  I was like, I didn't remember seeing Ope on the way in. 
[04:11:30]  I wonder, yep.  And so, yeah, Ope comes out just covering his face.  Well, there's no real good ending there, unfortunately.  Well, after you left, because there were some friends of friends there, somebody goes,  so that's Opey, huh?  Oh, no.  First impressions, yeah.  Wonderful.  All right.  We got some audio of BG's radio show?  Yes.  Sam, what's this about?  Well, I guess he does a sports show about the Dallas Cowboys. 
[04:12:00]  BingDCFanatic.com?  That's exactly right.  So I got the first minute 20 so you guys could see what a bang he comes into radio with.  All right.  Well, everybody in radio knows when you first start your show, that's when you got to set  your energy level.  That's why even at six in the morning, when we are exhausted, tired, those mics go up.  It's party time, my friend.  I don't care what the fuck anyone feels like.  Boom.  You got to hit them between the eyes.  Mm-hmm.  All right?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Very good.  Mm-hmm. 
[04:12:30]  Owner and CEO, DCFanatic.com, BG.  Right-o.  Mm-hmm.  No?  What happened?  I thought that was a cue.  For what?  For you to hit the audio.  What were we talking about?  Because we want to hear the boy audio.  Where were we?  What?  I think we were leaving.  Okay, I'll see you all Monday.  I've got to go.  Just tell me what we're doing and we'll get back on track.  It's no big deal, man.  Yeah.  What's the big hullabaloo? 
[04:13:00]  Sam's voice could only be heard by dogs.  Perhaps that's why Opie missed it.  What happened?  You want to give that intro again, Sam, to Opie?  Vitiligo face.  Hurry up.  Oh, listen up.  I was just saying, it's a sports show.  Yeah.  About the cowboys.  About the cowboys.  And this is him coming into his show with a bang.  With a bang.  Bing Crosby?  No, bang.  A bang.  Bang.  Bang what?  Bada-bing?  What kind of accent is that? 
[04:13:30]  I don't know.  A bang.  With a bang.  With a bang.  With a bang.  With a bang.  With a bang.  I don't know.  I feel he's building a relationship with me.  My father used to hit me with a whiskey bottle.  That's pretty loud.  It's Louie Henderson.  Say it again, bang.  Bang.  Bang.  Bang.  Bang.  With a bang.  Let's hear your deep radio voice.  We all have one.  Anything.  Jimmy, do your deep radio voice. 
[04:14:00]  Hey, this is Jim Norton.  Listen to the radio.  I'm listening.  Welcome aboard.  Very, very professional.  Anthony, would you like to do your deep radio voice?  I certainly would, Opie.  Thank you.  Very good.  Anybody else want to try their deep radio voice?  Where's E-Rock?  E-Rock.  It's good for a deep radio voice.  No, he's not.  Let's get E-Rock. 
[04:14:30]  Get that.  And then we'll listen to...  E-Rock, we want to hear your deep radio voice.  We know you've done radio.  Let it rip.  Come on, child hat.  Hey, this is my deep radio voice.  Oh.  It's a little crackly.  Like you were trying to go a little too deep.  All right, let's...  Come up a little.  All right, Sam's going to do his deep radio voice.  Work on it.  Let's go, Sam.  All three hundred.  Infantry.  Hey, you finally made it. 
[04:15:00]  This is my deep radio voice.  Oh, three hundred.  Faggot.  Yeah, exactly.  Holy dog shit.  What are you, Mickey Spillane?  You talked like a girl.  He actually got a little deeper than I thought he would.  Thank you.  All right, set up.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Set up the bit, Sam.  Wow.  That's funny.  Every time you talk, fucking pixie dust should come out of the ceiling. 
[04:15:30]  This is the DC Fanatic with his sports show about the Dallas Cowboys, and he's coming  into his show with a bang of energy.  I'm being.  I'm being.  I'm being.  You can't bring me the bang.  I'm being.  Oh, no.  I'm being.  And he's coming in with a bang of energy.  Okay.  And, Opie, that's your cue to hit the button.  Oh, man.  I forgot.  Dude, you know what I love?  I love to eat pussy.  Yeah.  You know how it sounds when I eat pussy? 
[04:16:00]  Where's E-Rock?  E-Rock.  What the fuck happened?  That's how I eat pussy.  E-Rock, everyone's requesting that you do your eating pussy sound. 
[04:16:30]  And if anybody else would like to do theirs, please line up.  E-Rock, the mic is yours.  Yes, you do.  All right.  Come on, everyone.  Once again, this is how Jimmy eats pussy.  Jimmy, if you will.  Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck! 
[04:17:00]  Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!  All right.  It's E-Rock's turn.  E-Rock?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's great.  Whose pussy are you eating?  Hand solos?  That was a Down Syndrome pussy noise.  That was awful.  A lot of echo, too.  It sounded like...  Eh.  Only one way to...  Oh, God damn.  Sam? 
[04:17:30]  Do you like to eat pussy?  Yeah.  Do you like to eat pussy?  Yeah.  Do you need pussy noise?  Well, here it goes.  It's going to be, yuck.  Yeah.  Eh.  It smells funny.  Sam?  Sam, do you eat the pussy?  Where's the helmet?  I wouldn't bang her with my pussy.  Eh.  Sam?  Mm-hmm.  What do you think?  Pussy?  Good?  Bad?  Indifferent?  Good.  Good.  Okay.  Good boy.  You're pussy eating noise.  What the fuck was that? 
[04:18:00]  Your tongue didn't even clear your fingers.  Oh, my God.  If that just didn't sound like...  Will you show these youngsters once again, please?  Learn from the master.  Oh.  How much of this will not be on the replay, by the way? 
[04:18:30]  We're in late time, aren't we?  Oh.  Look how late it's got.  Oh, just...  You know what you do?  Get rid of that boring interview we did with the director.  All right.  Yeah, we don't need that.  Throw that out.  Every interview we did today goes...  Let's say you're pussy eating.  Well, the Craig's interview was pretty good, because I was the star of that one, so I went  for it.  Get into it.  All right, yeah.  Ready to try.  Trying to make it sound like the finish line at one of the Special Olympics events. 
[04:19:00]  Yeah, exactly.  That really was like...  No one can see it.  Just pretend you're a holy one.  We'll pretend you're making a pussy sound.  Yeah.  He's licking his finger.  I don't know how to make that noise.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We know you don't, son.  It's okay, though.  All right.  So what was this recording?  It's actually a DC Fanatic's sports radio show. 
[04:19:30]  He does a sports show about the town.  We heard it three fucking times already.  Exactly.  Boys.  Let's hear it.  And with a bing, he does it.  He does it with a bing.  And Opie hits the button, and now.  I like apple pie.  Me too.  It's like trying to hold something together.  Do you know what I do when I'm in a haunted house, and I get scared?  No.  I start to just repeat to myself.  It makes a boy feel better. 
[04:20:00]  This is silly.  If someone gets me blueberries, I will push the button.  Bye. 
[04:20:30]  You're listening to WBLS.  I just thought I'd contribute.  All right. 
[04:21:00]  Well, BG, his name is.  Oh, a text message.  Holy.  Jimmy, can you write me a text message?  I don't know how to text.  Did we do this?  Gum, gum, gum.  I like chewing it.  It's a song I sing sometimes.  Holy shit.  I do want to hear this guy's radio show. 
[04:21:30]  What guy?  Oh, I don't know.  I don't know.  Anyone that says we don't give XM a good show, that's rubber band on the mic.  Where's my paycheck? 
[04:22:00]  Paycheck.  This is all for you, BJ.  BG.  Let me get his fucking name right.  It's all for a BJ. 
[04:22:30]  Let's start a jam band.  I'd like that.  I want to hear his show.  Start with the noise and I'll try to jump in.  Okay.  Don't put a hard one to.  It has to be a rhythm.  Oh.  Go like you.  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  Okay, hold on.  Boom, boom.  Um.  Baby, cunt, cunt.  No, we're not singing.  We're just jamming.  Oh, no words?  We're just jamming.  I'll start it.  All I keep thinking is the promo. 
[04:23:00]  The old me and Anthony's show.  They are probably so pissed.  Oh, I don't blame them.  Over it.  They're just listening going, what the fuck are they doing?  What is this garbage?  We can't be paying them for this.  Here's the beauty. 
[04:23:30]  This is somebody's first day hearing the show.  Somebody's hearing the show for the first time.  Got all their equipment hooked up.  That's right.  Find Bob Edwards, stupid.  It's as good as it gets.  Let's say hi to Lonnie.  Lonnie.  Oh, God damn.  Hey, guys.  I have a request.  I want to hear Frank DeFroner eat pussy.  He might implode.  Yeah, no kidding.  His head might blow off.  That's the sound I make. 
[04:24:00]  It's hard for me to get my tongue.  Sometimes it just comes out a little bit.  It only comes out of my mouth about an eighth of an inch.  I'm not able to satisfy a woman with my mouth.  People, I do remind you, we are only obligated to do radio until 11, so that anything you've 
[04:24:30]  heard for the past 25 minutes is considered free.  We're only obligated.  Like it's considered, like, um, as if we're not even here.  We're only obligated to do it until 11.  Unfortunately, today, we did it until about 7.15.  People are saying this sounds like our old afternoon show.  Drunk.  Oh, balloon animals! 
[04:25:00]  Where did he go?  I hope he just ran out of the studio yelling balloon animals.  Mucinex.  Mucinex.  Shaking a pill bottle.  I think that's the end of this awful show today.  Is that it?  I had a good time today.  I had fun.  I was very, um...  Do you remember when we did the story about the, uh, the, the train saw Psycho? 
[04:25:30]  I had nothing for that one.  It seems like, like, two days ago, doesn't it?  Yeah.  But we had fun with that.  We talked about a guy getting, uh, cut up.  Uh, did a little Saul Rosenberg.  Yeah.  Impression there.  I'm just doing a little recap.  Mm-hmm.  Um, like at the end of...  I read the paper.  ...at the end of an 80s, uh, action show, how during the credits, like MacGyver, they  would show the whole episode, like, in photographs, or chips, and then at the end, they'd be smiling.  That's kind of what I'm, I'm feeling, like, doing right now. 
[04:26:00]  So let's just smile at each other.  I was very tired.  Tired today.  Were you?  And a little sad.  Are you?  It happens.  I'll live.  Does it?  Yeah, I was just feeling a little blue.  Yeah.  Are there really balloon animals?  I don't know, but I'd like one.  I'm not panicked.  I'll say he did.  I, see, now I don't know.  I kind of really want to hear this guy's first thing.  That's what we do around here for a laugh.  Is it on there?  Let me hear a little bit of it.  I got him. 
[04:26:30]  Don't look around nervously, fan.  Just play it.  It's DC Fanatic Radio, where everyone wants their babies to grow up to be cowboys.  Because I'm going to be a cowboy fast man.  With a top left eye and a sunshine, shining cowboy.  That was relevant years ago.  Super Bowl 41.  That's all we're talking about, people.  That's all we want.  That's all I want to see.  Super Bowl 41.  I want the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl 41. 
[04:27:00]  I want them to win Super Bowl 41.  Oh, my God.  I want six rings in 06.  What's up, people?  This is DC Fanatic.  Of course, on DC Fanatic Radio.  Coming to you today on July 3rd, 2006.  This is going to be the post.  No.  See, I knew I was going to screw that up.  This is going to be the off-season wrap-up show.  We're going to talk about everything that just happened in the last six months.  Since the Cowboys' last game against the Rams, which I would rather not talk about. 
[04:27:30]  Nobody really wants to hear about because the game was horrible.  They lost.  They didn't make the playoffs.  Everyone was disappointed.  He's the least fanatic fanatic ever.  Let's just get over it.  Let's just get down to this 2006 season.  We've got a lot of good things looking forward to.  We've got T.O.  I mean, wow.  We're in the Super Bowl.  All right.  Enough of that talk.  Oh, yeah.  Exactly.  Enough of that talk. 
[04:28:00]  Holy shit.  There's about an hour more where that came from.  An hour.  He does a little podcast show.  Oh, this guy is so good.  That's wonderful.  And he's the first letter, the first little bitching fuck about him not winning an iMac  during the iMac contest.  Nice ass, Jimmy.  Jimmy's now spreading his cheeks right at Sam and the Palto camera.  The girls are horrified.  All right.  I've had it.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, this is great. 
[04:28:30]  Yeah, DC Fanatic Radio.  We'll have to hold on to this.  Yeah, this is really good.  Piece of shit.  Guy sucks.  All right.  Enough of that talk.  That's the people doing what their XM radios right now at the end of this program.  I apologize.  I'll apologize to the audience.  That was awful.  I know I was.  No, you weren't, darling.  You're right.  I'd love to hang out and do another three, four minutes. 
[04:29:00]  But I got to go.  So we are pretty much done.  Opie, thank you.  Have a good weekend.  Hope he's having fun with his balloon animals.  Jimmy, I will see you Monday because we don't cohort during the weekends.  Perish the thought.  We hung out.  Go fuck yourself.  I'll come by your place.  I'm sleeping.  I'll come by and talk to the kids.  And, Drew, thank you again.  What a bang-up job you've done.  What it is, but I'm sure it's being up.  Bing up job.  And, uh, Fan, take us out.  Thank you.  Oh, shit. 
[04:29:30]  The virus is out.  Tell your friends.  He's infected.  That's right, Opie.  Take that.  You, shut your mouth.  I love the homoerotic nature of the whole event.  The virus made my genitals rot off.  Oh, dude, don't come near me.  We're your celebrity skin cancer connection.  And it was better than my first kiss.  Oh, laugh until your energy spill out on the chair.  Anthony Show. </pre>
