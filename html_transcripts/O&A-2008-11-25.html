<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with comedian Jim Jefferies as a guest.  Jefferies shared a traumatic story about a childhood molestation at Boy Scouts and a subsequent argument with his mother, who revealed her own history of physical abuse related to the event.  This was unexpectedly followed by a revelation of Jefferies' extreme phobia of bananas, triggered by the presence of one in the studio.  The hosts relentlessly teased him about this, culminating in Jefferies briefly leaving the studio.

Next, Bobby Lee joined the show.  The ensuing conversation was filled with crude jokes about race, ethnicity, and Lee's experiences on *MADtv*, including an on-air accident involving soiling himself while detoxing from Vicodin.  The discussion continued with off-color jokes, banter about Lee's career, and further ribbing of Jefferies' banana phobia. This segment also involved a significant discussion of Esther Koo, a female Asian comedian known for stereotypical humor, particularly concerning Asian men's perceived lack of sexual appeal to non-Asian women.  Lee expressed mixed feelings about her act, acknowledging the humor while also criticizing the negativity. The conversation included numerous sexually explicit jokes about Asian people.

Later, Bobby Lee's appearance continued, focusing largely on his choice of women's underwear with pink trim, resulting in more ribbing from the hosts. This caused Lee to experience a panic attack on air, accompanied by sweating, redness, and difficulty breathing. The segment also mentioned minor studio tremors, a potentially faulty microphone, and cockroach sightings.  The presence of Tippi Tom, a guest with a notably strong body odor, became a recurring joke throughout the segment.  Attempts to manage Tom's presence involved a walk through the audience and eventual seating in the audience. Brie Olsen, a porn star, was mentioned as a scheduled guest but didn't feature prominently.  Lee eventually left the studio, unsure if he had been pranked.

A "Dr. Steve" conducted a sexually suggestive "exam" of Tippi Tom, focusing on his ankles, prostate, and rear end.  This was followed by a showcasing of Opie's old television demo tapes, featuring awkward PSAs and lighthearted appearances, which were heavily criticized by the hosts.  The demo reel included clips from local TV appearances, including a Coca-Cola commercial with an actress deemed "horrible looking," and appearances on a Jerry Lewis Telethon. A phone call with Cheryl, a recently evicted *Big Brother* contestant, ensued, filled with sexual innuendo and vulgar jokes. The conversation concluded with the hosts' amusement and disbelief.  The segment ended with more sexually charged jokes involving a hotel key mishap and references to the Achille Lauro hijacking.

The show continued with a fragmented poem or song lyrics recited by an unidentified person, filled with violent imagery. Duff McKagan of Guns N' Roses called in, expressing disgust and calling the show a "degrading freak show," advocating for its cancellation.  Jim Norton then arrived in studio.  The hosts interviewed Melee, a promoter of staged catfights for the website catfight1.com, discussing rules, participant ages, and desired actions during the fights, often in sexually suggestive terms.  A significant portion involved Opie's claimed ability to guess a woman's age by looking at her "taint," leading to awkward attempts to have Melee and a female guest named Colin reveal their "taint" for Opie's demonstration.  Opie eventually guessed Colin's age correctly.  The planned catfight then took place, with detailed commentary from the hosts highlighting the various moves and actions, including hair pulling, slapping, biting, and clothing removal.  Melee was declared the winner. The segment concluded with phone calls featuring jokes and comments about individuals with Down syndrome, including discussions about abortion rates following Down syndrome diagnoses and a song mocking individuals with the condition.

A discussion about police chases and the impact of video cameras on policing transitioned into a story from a caller, Steve from Jersey (also referred to as Kenny), detailing a drug deal gone wrong resulting in a shootout.  This was followed by a discussion about Danny's grandfather's death and funeral, focusing on the often-phony eulogies and uncomfortable atmosphere with vulgar language.  The hosts also discussed funeral arrangements, including coffins and cremation, with frequent crude humor.  Louis Black, in studio to promote his book, joined the conversation. The hosts engaged in banter, touching upon his writing process, experiences in the publishing industry, and his new book about religion, along with his upcoming Comedy Central show and challenges with network censors.

The final segment continued with Louis Black promoting his book, initiating a rambling rant about the Amish and their Rumspringa tradition. The conversation shifted to religions, focusing on Islam, expressing fear of criticism due to potential violent backlash, contrasting it with freedom to criticize other religions. Scientology and Mormonism were briefly discussed.  The 2008 Presidential election was discussed, with the hosts expressing disdain for all candidates and speculating on the election outcome.  A significant portion involved unsubstantiated speculation about Heath Ledger's death, focusing on rumors involving a masseuse and the possibility of a cover-up, with a fictional coroner, Jim C., contributing further outlandish theories.  The segment concluded with a brief mention of Heath Ledger's death and a final advertisement.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the worst of all of you.  Now this is cool. This is something unique and different.  Oh, it's a nice change of pace.  Strap on your deuce chill belt.  That just stinks.  There's no substance to it.  Oh, it's just this big confusing mess of who gives a crap.  Yeah, we suck.  Anything else?  My mom, I had a friend commit suicide a while back.  It's a cheery thing, but I had an argument with her before she committed suicide that day. 
[00:00:30]  I rang my mom up and I go, I said some awful things, mom.  And she goes, well, James, in your life you're going to say hurtful things to people that you don't mean,  but you just try to minimize these things so they don't happen again.  And she goes, I'm just happy.  I've said some awful things in my life, but I'm just happy that I never said anything bad to you or your brothers.  And I'm like, what did you do when you left the house?  Were you just like stabbing people in the street or something? 
[00:01:00]  Last time I was home, I got woken up by this 400-pound woman bashing into my room going,  I want you to know that when I'm dead, in many ways you've been a huge disappointment to me.  And the reason for that is because I didn't show her some photos and I showed them to my dad.  Oh, she's mental.  She used to beat the hell out of me.  I got scars on my butt.  Really?  She used to hit me with a belt buckle from a scout belt, right, because I wouldn't go to scout.  The reason I wouldn't go is I was being molested every day I was there.  Oh, my God. 
[00:01:30]  Wow.  She goes, why would you go?  I don't want to go.  Boom.  You must have been an adorable little kid.  Now it explains all the stories you told us yesterday.  Yes, it does.  Right, Jimmy?  Now we understand.  Boy Scouts.  We understand why you do what you do sexually.  I had MySpace messages just a row of 20 when I got back to the hotel yesterday that just  said, gay.  You got molested at Boy Scouts?  At Scouts, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he never actually physically inside or anything. 
[00:02:00]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Yeah.  Well, was that all right, you think?  Yeah.  Probably not.  He used to just put me in a corner.  Anyway, it wasn't a good day.  Either way you look at it.  It wasn't a good day either.  Was he into just looking at you?  The thing is, he always wanted you to call him Baloo through the whole experience.  He never lost his seniority from the Jungle Book.  What did he make you do?  You got to kind of keep it sort of vague.  But we'll figure it out.  A lot of swearing and sitting in the corner. 
[00:02:30]  It was like being in the front row at SeaWorld.  Oh, no.  Okay.  Oh, Jesus.  Wow.  Oh, God.  When Shamu flips up in the air and lands in the air.  Caution.  Caution, you may get wet, is what they say.  Yeah, when Shamu.  That was the best way I could describe it.  I thought that was pretty good, the way I danced around there.  Wow.  Oh, God.  So this was going on at Scouts.  You go home, and now you decide, you know, it's in my best interest not to go back there 
[00:03:00]  anymore.  And now you're getting.  It was cobs, actually.  And now you're getting beat by your mom because you won't go to Scouts to get molested, basically.  Mom used to thrash me with the belt buckle of the Scout belt.  When the hell did this happen?  And those Scout belts, they're like those big buckles and everything.  It wasn't nice. 
[00:03:30]  In the end, my dad found out.  I tell this a little bit in my routine, but I'll mention it anyway.  In the end, my dad found out.  I swear to God, this is what he said.  He comes to me and he goes, I went with me mate who it also happened to.  And my dad said, you've done the right thing by coming to see us, and I want you to know  that you've done nothing wrong, and he's done everything wrong, and he's going to get what's  coming to him.  And then my dad hugged me and looked at me and went, I wonder how you got all those badges.  And people think I made that up.  Oh, wow.  But I swear to God, that's true.  And the thing is, I respect my father so much for that, because I believe comedy is all 
[00:04:00]  about taking risks.  And my father was holding his molested child, and he thought, no, it's a good one.  Have a go.  Maybe I'll get a joke here.  I'm just going to let this one fly.  I'll just work it in.  Did you laugh?  No, I didn't really get it.  I can promise you, later on that evening, he was in the pub with his mates going, and  then I said.  Let's say good morning to Cleveland.  We got Pete on the line.  Pete.  That is true.  Pete, what's up?  Dude, that's awesome. 
[00:04:30]  Hey, Jim.  Hey, guys.  Hey, buddy.  Hey.  All right.  I've been lingering longer, and you guys were playing.  I don't know.  It was when you're on vacation or something.  They did a replay.  And Bob Kelly was in the studio with you guys, and he was talking about, he did this  set, and there was this guy that was in the waiting room with him that was, like, deathly  afraid of something.  And it turned out it was Jim Jeffries.  This was a long time ago, and I guess you guys all forgot about it.  Hmm. 
[00:05:00]  What is he afraid of?  Bananas.  Oh, yeah.  No, I don't.  I don't like bananas.  In fact, there's a pill over there that I've already...  How did you...  How did you...  No, don't do that.  No, no, no, no, no.  No, no.  Seriously, it's open.  Don't...  Don't...  Don't screw with him.  Wait, what is this about?  He's actually leaving the studio.  I don't like bananas.  I don't like...  I'm just holding up the...  Are you doing a bit?  No, I'm serious.  Put it back, Opie.  Don't make the guest uncomfortable. 
[00:05:30]  No, no, put it back.  I don't like it when it's open like that.  Like this?  Yes!  Don't do that!  All right.  What is going on?  Put it back, and we will ask, and maybe there's an explanation.  Wait, this is like kryptonite.  Look at this.  Watch it.  No, don't make our guest uncomfortable.  Don't open it up.  No, seriously.  It's not funny.  Wait, do those things open look like what a Scoutmaster's trousers look like?  All right.  Put it back.  Hold on.  It's got to be said that I just...  He saw my banana over here. 
[00:06:00]  I eat a banana and yogurt every morning.  This guy just said that he's deathly afraid of bananas, and he pointed at my banana.  I picked it up.  I just started showing it to him, and he's moved away.  How did that guy know I didn't like bananas?  Are you talking about bananas?  I guess Bob Kelly had said it once.  Wait, this is a real moment.  What's up?  I have a thing with bananas.  All right.  You're going to tell us after the break.  This is the tease right now.  Wait.  Who's turning off the channel right now?  The worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[00:06:30]  If I shut my eyes, I can't see it, so do what you want.  You can feel it, though, right?  No, no, no, no.  Just feel the banana.  I'm not going to touch you.  Please, just feel it.  I'm not going to touch you.  Don't.  Don't.  Don't.  Why would you do that?  How weird is it, though?  Look at him.  He doesn't like...  People don't like balloons.  Some people don't like baked beans.  Some people don't like clowns.  I don't like bananas.  How does it make you feel when you see it, though?  It used to make me vomit.  Now it's just like someone holding a spider to an arachnophobe or something.  Well, it looks like a spider because it's all like...  No, yeah, yeah, yeah.  When it's open like that, it's like... 
[00:07:00]  Why are you doing that?  Because it's an amazing reaction.  Leave him alone.  I've gotten better.  A year ago, I couldn't even be in this room.  In the room?  No.  You barely could be in the room.  You're, like, moving away from the mic.  When did you realize that there was this...  Ever since I was a child, I never liked it.  Wow.  You know what the banana represents?  What are we getting?  I can't have a squirt gun with milk shooting out of this.  Opie, you're being very cruel. 
[00:07:30]  It's his kryptonite.  He doesn't like that.  But it's amazing to me.  See, my problem is now, because he wrote Robert Kelly, he tells everybody, and some  guy in, I don't know, Wisconsin or something, rings up and tells me that I don't like bananas.  I thought it was a fairly well-kept secret.  And now there's going to be, like, people at the show tonight just with a banana, just  sitting on their knee, just in the front.  No.  Have them thrown out.  Oh, yeah.  Have them thrown out.  If you bring a banana, you will be thrown out of the venue.  I once shagged a bird.  Want to say that word?  Oh, sure.  Sure.  I once shagged a bird, and she put her condom on, and it was banana flavor. 
[00:08:00]  But I didn't know.  It was banana.  I vomited all over.  With that artificial smell.  You don't even like the smell of banana.  So you don't like any banana flavors?  Let's just see what happens.  Just hold this banana.  I'm not going to hold it.  I'm not going to hold it.  It just ain't going to happen.  Hold my banana.  Something happened.  Did the scalp...  No, no.  I was, yeah.  No, no.  But I mean, is there a...  Was I molested with a banana?  No, no.  By breakfast or something, where that smell... 
[00:08:30]  It's a visceral reaction probably.  I don't know.  My mom said even as a baby, I wouldn't eat mashed up bananas.  Really?  I remember my brothers used to hold me down and mash banana into my head.  Oh, what bastards.  That's what you thought something in.  Yeah, but I didn't like it before then.  They would do that because you didn't like it, not because it wasn't the cause of it.  You know what I found...  They weren't mashing bananas into your head.  That's what they told your child market service.  Grrr.  Grrr.  Grrr.  Grrr.  You can't do that.  Grrr.  Grrr.  Hopi, why are you being such an ass to our guest? 
[00:09:00]  I'm just showing love, man.  We love this Jim Jeffries guy.  How would you like if someone brought a vacuum in and just started vacuuming around you?  Don't you like vacuums?  Bit over.  Bit over.  He hates vacuums.  Anthony figured out a way to make you stop.  Why wouldn't you like vacuums?  Bit over.  Bit over.  The sound of a vacuum drives him nuts.  Really?  Yeah, absolutely.  Nuts.  My mom would vacuum our house, I don't know, hours at a time, and we'd be watching TV 
[00:09:30]  and...  Grrr.  Grrr.  And when they found that out...  Lift your feet!  Listeners would start calling.  Lift your feet.  Listeners would start calling and over the phone just play the vacuum sound and it would  freak them out.  Dude, I'm lucky...  Exhaust fans in like bathrooms, it's the same sort of sound.  No, it's just vacuums.  I'm lucky enough now in my life to have a cleaning lady and she comes once a week and she was  vacuuming the other day.  I had to leave the apartment.  Really?  I had to leave the apartment.  All right, see? 
[00:10:00]  Look what it does.  I love that sound.  It smells good.  That's my thing.  Yeah, I like that sound.  And just like you, I don't know why.  It can't be just because my mom was vacuuming a lot as a kid.  But look at my arm.  Goosebumps right away from the sound of a vacuum.  Can I feel them?  Yeah, here you go.  You know what gets me?  You know the air hose on a compressor?  Use it like to clean up.  If you work in a shop, you use it to blow off sawdust or metal chips off a lathe or something 
[00:10:30]  like that.  To put it a little too close to your arm and hit the air and it like makes your skin go  like a little bit.  That, I can't even deal with that.  How often does that happen?  Well, you know something in the, when you're in a work in a shop, it happens a lot.  Yeah, because you're like cleaning stuff up.  You used to do that?  And just the air coming out of the nozzle kind of gives me the heebie-jeebies.  I'm sadistic though.  I will do a bit where we get a lot of vacuums, turn them on all at the same time. 
[00:11:00]  I want to see how many vacuums I can take before I actually have to leave the studio.  Because I will leave the studio eventually.  I bet one.  I don't think one.  The one makes the goosebumps pop up immediately in the hair on the back of my neck.  But, you know, as someone is reminding us, we're missing the obvious here.  What?  Maury.  Maury fears.  Oh my God.  Yeah.  You would be perfect on Maury Povich.  Yeah.  Because he has people confront their fears, you know, to help them.  Whoa.  Whoa. 
[00:11:30]  The banana is getting loose in my hand.  Don't.  Whoa.  It has a life on its own.  Whoa.  You know something?  Whoa.  Oh, stop it.  Will you stop it?  Whoa.  This isn't even good radio.  Stop it.  People at home are already bored of this.  This is boring.  Jim has been nothing but a great guest on our program.  And you're rewarding him by being a douche.  I won't vomit or anything.  I'm all right.  My ex-flatmate put a banana in my underwear drawer and I punched him in the head.  You punched him?  And I made him wash all my underwear as well. 
[00:12:00]  It's weird because you look down.  Like, you can't make eye contact with the banana or the person that is holding the banana.  You kind of look down and shy away from the microphone.  Watch.  Whoa.  Oh, don't.  Why?  Would you?  Why?  It's that little flinch that a dog gets that you've hit a lot.  Yeah, yeah.  That's exactly what you look like.  No, no, no.  No, don't give it to Gordon.  I'm actually just going to give it to Gordon.  Don't.  Uh-oh.  Oh, yeah.  No, no, no.  You can't watch people eat a banana.  No, the whole density of the thing and they chew it.  Jimmy, let's eat our banana.  They chew it.  Oh, my God.  Why are you doing this to this man? 
[00:12:30]  Jimmy, we won't.  My mouth is different now.  Oh, my God.  They're so attested to the banana.  I'd rather eat Big A's tongue dick.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I think you said that.  Hey.  Jim.  It's a good dick.  No, see, look.  He's going to leave.  Don't leave.  See, he's going to leave.  He's leaving.  It's just a...  I'll be back.  It's just a finish.  You've been out of it.  It's delicious.  Holy crap.  This is a real thing.  He just left.  Dude, this is not fake. 
[00:13:00]  He doesn't like bananas.  It's thick and banana-y.  Next time he comes to New York, we have to have a studio filled with bananas.  Quirkly, Joe.  Hundreds of them.  I had a smoothie yesterday, and it's, you know, banana, heavy banana and strawberry, but  it smells like banana, and he was kind of sitting, like, in the seat next to me.  I wonder if that was bothering him.  Oh, this sucks.  All right.  We like him too much.  Wait, let me finish my banana.  He's been a great guest.  You don't want to have him not come back.  I'm not having a hissy fit.  I'll be back.  Just finish the bananas.  What? 
[00:13:30]  I can't hear you.  Just finish the bananas.  Could you walk to that mic?  I can't hear you.  I'm not being a girl.  I just...  Oh, he's got the banana peel just cocked back in his hand like he's ready to heave it at  him.  You are so mean.  He's giving us such great radio, too.  Jimmy, are you done with your banana?  I certainly am.  Oh, ho.  Now, Jimmy's put the banana peel on his head.  Look, we'll make it fun.  We'll wear him as all banana hats. 
[00:14:00]  Okay.  All right?  All right.  Jim, look.  Look what I do for you.  No, don't.  No, I'm serious.  Don't dangle it, man.  What?  Even this?  I'll start swearing when we take it off the air.  You don't want this.  Leave him alone.  Do you like Jimmy's banana hat?  I like Jimmy's banana hat.  Yeah.  Coochie-coo.  That is weird.  It's not nice.  Jimmy, you got one of those things?  Mine is vacuums. 
[00:14:30]  His is bananas.  Anses is air hoses or whatever.  Do you think I would tell you?  I have one and I would never tell you.  You got one?  Oh, yeah.  Is it an innocent thing?  Kind of.  Heterosexual sex?  Is it an innocent thing?  See, mine's...  Like the laugh of a small child?  Oh, I got something for you.  Thank you, Thad.  Hmm.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  I have no word.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Banana phone. 
[00:15:00]  You're holding it open.  I've got this feeling so appealing for us to get together and sing.  Sing!  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Banana phone.  Ding, dong, ding, dong, ding, dong, ding.  Banana phone.  It grows in bunches.  I've got my hunches.  It's the best.  Beats the rest.  Cellular, modular, interactive, modular.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Banana phone.  You're a bastard.  I'm doing the dancing banana.  That's a ball of wine.  Banana phone.  Pick a wine. 
[00:15:30]  Woo!  It's no bologna.  It ain't a phony.  My cellular.  Bananular phone.  All right.  Jim.  See?  It's in the beat.  It's in the beat.  Listen, listen.  There we go.  All right.  Dead and buried.  It's in the garbage.  Did you get Norton's one as well?  I threw mine out.  Oh, okay.  All right.  We're okay.  I'm sorry about that.  And now people think I'm an idiot.  I have another one, but I do enjoy a good banana.  I like to eat them.  Yeah.  I know people, too.  It's a superfood.  It's a superfood. 
[00:16:00]  It's full of some vitamin that I obviously lack.  Yeah, potassium.  You've never had a banana?  No, no, no.  That's so weird.  All right.  We've got Big A in studio.  Someone offered me about $500 once to eat a little bit, and I vomited.  Well, could you do that for our radio show next time you're in town?  That would be terrific radio.  I would need much more money than that.  Would you ever take a gig-  That was when I was poor.  At Bananas in Poughkeepsie.  That's a funny question.  Would you ever take a gig at Bananas in Poughkeepsie?  I can handle the word.  Yeah?  There's big bananas hanging.  It's fake. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, yeah.  They're fake, but they're big.  You can do that?  I used to have one of these blow-up bananas that you rode in the pool with.  Oh, really?  Like a pool pony, but I was cool with that.  Oh, okay.  So you're not completely insane.  It's just actual bananas.  I can't go to Queensland, though.  Up in Queensland, there's just banana plantations everywhere.  Oh, wow.  And I have my hands just walking through it, and the trees attacking me and stuff.  They're not trees.  They're like bamboo-y type things.  Yeah, banana, whatever they are.  If you were drowning, and the only way to reach you was with a banana, would you grab it? 
[00:17:00]  What do you mean, the only way to reach me?  Like you're just out of hands reach.  Oh, yeah.  So you're saying, a banana, this is going to happen, is it?  The only way to reach me is banana.  You haven't got an item of clothing that you can chuck off with your hand.  You're naked.  You're only holding a banana.  You couldn't stick your leg out instead, which is longer than your arm.  You're just out of legs reach, you had to put a banana between his toes.  It's a banana.  I love how this guy does it. 
[00:17:30]  Jeffrey's rules.  I would tell you that use your leg, or use your shirt, or something like that.  Because then I know, even if you save me, then on the boat, going back to the big boat,  you'd just be baiting me with a banana the whole time.  It's true.  And that would be uncomfortable, going, who saved you?  Who saved you?  You'd just have to jump in the water again.  Hey, this is Jim Jefferies, and you're listening to the worst of the worst fucking...  Ah, fuck that one.  I'll do it again. 
[00:18:00]  Hey, this is Jim Jefferies, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  And if it's the worst, it's going to be fucking shit.  Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  We've got to say hi to Bobby Lee.  He's just pacing out there.  Is he here?  Where is he?  Bobby, what are you doing out there?  By the coffee machine or something?  I wouldn't drink that coffee.  No one has drank that coffee in months, Bobby.  I thought that was Bobby Lee, and then I started questioning how much I can differentiate Asians. 
[00:18:30]  Bobby, what are you doing?  We'll get you some Starbucks.  Don't drink that coffee.  He just tripped.  Why are you tripping?  Hey!  How are you doing, man?  He's doing a fucking Dick Van Dyke entrance.  Pull up a comfy chair.  Hey, how are you?  How are you?  How come Mike didn't get a hug? 
[00:19:00]  That was the all great chair.  That was the all great chair.  Bobby Lee gave a hey and a really good hug to Robert Kelly, a hey and a really good  hug to Jimmy, and then just looked at Mike and went, hey.  Mike, you want a hug, man?  No, it's not.  No, I can't do it right now, Doug.  Why didn't you?  No, it's cool.  It's done, man.  The moment's over.  But it was funny, because Mike's arm went out and hugged most.  And then he put it in a handshake.  No, you fucking revised history.  That did not happen.  That would have been hilarious if it happened, but it's not what happened. 
[00:19:30]  No, you gave me like nom eyes, you know what I mean?  Like when I was a nom, right?  And then you got to stab me or something.  I know these two, you know what I mean?  Oh, you guys don't know each other?  No, we don't.  Yeah, no, no.  I mean, no.  I'm a fan.  I just, you know what I mean?  It was awkward.  I'm sorry.  I'm a fan?  What the fuck is that?  Should I start over?  What are we in Hollywood?  You just say, I'm a fan to everybody?  Hey, I'm a fan.  Hey, look, I'm just a fan.  Dude, that is so true about Hollywood. 
[00:20:00]  Everybody's a fucking fan, and then behind each other's backs, just stabbing you.  You see some obscure soap opera star on Sunset Boulevard.  Hey, I'm a fan.  I've never seen your work.  I've just seen your picture in a couple magazines.  Big fan.  You run into Rod Stewart.  Big fan.  All the albums.  Yeah.  Big fan of your stomach contents, Rod.  Thank you so much.  Is that it?  Am I gone now?  There you go.  They're telling us Bobby has to go.  If anyone wants to know who Bobby is, he's the Asian guy on Mad TV that no one watches? 
[00:20:30]  No one watches the Asian guy or the Mad TV girl?  No, this show.  What's wrong with you, Mike?  No, everyone says it's still on.  I love Bobby.  Look, dude, he made good in the show.  I like Mad TV.  I like Mad TV.  Really?  Yeah.  I gave you a hug, dude.  Hold on.  Name one skit from Mad TV.  Yeah, you're a fan, right?  Yeah, I like the Asian, the girl does the Asian lady.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's gone.  She's been gone for eight years.  I like the guy.  He's been gone for eight fucking years. 
[00:21:00]  But he's a fan.  He's a fan.  I'm not a fan.  He's a huge fan.  I'm not a fan of the show you're on.  When it first started, it was fucking great.  Yeah, but that sucks.  Yeah, Mike, how long is that show been on?  We're going to our 14th year.  Wow.  Yeah.  It's on Comedy Central all the time now, right?  I can't believe you just tried to play it off like you're a fan.  I am.  And then they asked for one sketch.  The girl left nine years ago.  You're like the new guy, the black guy who delivers the stuff?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's funny.  Name me a character that I do, Robert.  I like when you play the girl.  Any Asian girl you play, you just look like one.  Like one.  Name one. 
[00:21:30]  Name one Asian girl character.  Fucking Ming Lao.  Ming Lao?  I don't know.  He was trying to stick up for Bobby.  Thank you, Robert.  Bobby's hilarious.  I'm just saying.  It's not a well-viewed show.  Yeah, it does okay, though.  It's not like we get like nine Mexicans in the net.  Wow.  At least his show is viewed.  You can't watch it.  Jesus.  Wow.  Hey, hold on, Bob.  That was a real slam by Bob because he likes it.  He's got a very sensitive spot.  He did a CBS pilot, which was supposed to be very good, but they rejected it.  And Bob just made fun of him saying that at least yours gets viewed. 
[00:22:00]  So that's kind of a soft spot.  Well, you know, I probably should stay out of this because I don't have anything going on.  I'm at the cellar this weekend, Friday and Saturday night.  Three shows, Friday.  Four shows.  Michael Hitchcock did the show, right?  No.  Oh, yeah.  Michael Hitchcock did do my show.  Yeah.  He's on MADtv.  He played the veterinarian on my show.  Yeah, yeah.  I love how not in the industry that Bobby is that he says my pilot got canceled.  As though we're even on.  Got canceled.  As though we're on TV in the first place.  I just admitted that.  You're absolutely right.  Well, Mike's pilot got canceled. 
[00:22:30]  What are you, a fucking impressionist now, jackass?  They wrote a value jet on it and dropped it in the fucking front of everybody.  I did one good impression of his girlfriend.  And then you think you can just whip it around?  I like the new Mike Birbigli.  I think he's been brushing up on the O&A culture.  He's a mean motherfucker.  Come in here and fucking bare your teeth.  My friend Mike sincerely said it was amazing, the show.  Hitchcock, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  He said that you were very funny.  He's a talented guy.  He's the guy in Best in Show.  He was...  No, Michael Hitchcock.  He was the guy in Best in Show. 
[00:23:00]  He played Parker Posey's husband in Back in the Show.  Oh, fuck yeah.  The braces.  Hysterical.  I like her mustache.  Fuck yeah.  He played...  Thanks, dude.  Yeah, I'm going for the 70s porn look.  Yeah, I can't grow anything, man.  70s coming back.  It is coming back.  With a vengeance.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Trying to get AIDS.  Doing everything.  My show is loosely based on the period of my life, like many years ago.  Not yours.  Was.  What?  Was.  Was.  Shut up.  I'm just saying.  I'm just saying. 
[00:23:30]  Jim, I'm just saying.  So the listeners know.  Just because people hear your voice saying boring shit doesn't mean they're going to buy  more of your albums, Bobby.  I'm just saying, Mike.  Please.  I'm just saying.  Jim, to answer your question that you asked me.  I'm just saying, it's his.  Are you serious?  I'm just saying.  You're going to keep going with this babbling shit?  I'm just saying.  That's all.  That's all.  My Jim, was I just saying?  Yeah.  Just saying.  I don't know why you're getting so angry, Mike.  Awkward.  Yeah, you get very angry real quick.  What's wrong? 
[00:24:00]  Not angry.  Hey, don't do that psycho smile.  Maybe because Mike was in the middle of saying something and you decided to just chime in  over him.  Oh, so I'm sorry.  That's the way the show works.  He talks.  Then you talk.  Then I talk.  Nobody just jumps in and says funny shit.  Don't fuck yourself, you thin guinea.  No.  Funny.  Funny.  Funny shit is really subjective.  Hey, sometimes it's funny.  Sometimes it's not.  Fat guinea.  I'm Irish.  You look like a guinea. 
[00:24:30]  How are you saying you're Irish?  He's adopted by Irish people.  I know, so you're not Irish.  You're lucky to be fucking Italian.  You're probably Puerto Rican.  Colin said that my great-great-grandmother got raped on the Khyber Pass.  The Khyber Pass.  It's a fucking Colin.  Exactly.  Colin.  That's Colin.  Colin said my favorite slam of Bobby was Colin said Bobby should be dancing in a grass  skirt entertaining Australian tourists.  No, he's saying, I don't know, whatever.  What about that one? 
[00:25:00]  Did I say it wrong?  Yeah, he said it wrong.  He said, I look like, I look, I look, oh, go ahead.  What's the other one he said about him in a, in a gift shop?  That's the one.  He mixed it up.  That's what he said.  That's what you get from a gift shop.  No, that's the new one.  But what was the other one?  That Obadi?  He just made a gift at an airport coming back from.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hawaii.  Colin.  No, it wasn't.  It was Charlie.  Colin was dressed in the grass skirt for the Halloween show.  And then I said that the grass skirt was actually his Comedy Central contract that  they shredded.  Yeah, but he did say you should be dancing to make Australian tourists happy. 
[00:25:30]  And like a Tongan, and a Tongan something.  He just, it was very funny.  Last minute gift in a gift shop, coming back from China.  Yeah, you know.  There you go.  I'm going to have to read it off a teleprompter.  Last minute gift.  Can we get back to my particular?  To answer your question, Jim.  Thanks, Bobby, for the interruption.  But the...  Jesus, you're still on there, you little fucking angry cunt.  Just go.  Just say it.  Just say it.  I'm right here.  It's this period in my life where I was living with my girlfriend, my girlfriend at the time. 
[00:26:00]  And I knew she wanted to get married, but it was this unspoken thing.  And then we went to my brother's wedding, and they asked us to be in a photo.  And they said, do you want Abby in the photo?  And I said, yes.  But there was like this pause.  You look like you're going to cry.  No, it's a true story.  It's real, you know.  Your applause freaked her out.  Yeah, and then we got home that night.  We were living together, and she goes, you know, is this serious?  And I was like, yeah, of course it's serious.  I love you.  And she was like, you know, are we going to get married?  And I was like, yeah.  And then she was like, when? 
[00:26:30]  And what I should have said was, can we talk about this next summer?  And what I did say was, next summer.  And then she called everyone we knew and told them we were getting married.  And that's how I got engaged without getting engaged.  And so the sitcom is actually about this wedding that's never going to happen.  And you know it's not going to happen.  And everybody, and the people watching knows it's not going to happen, but she doesn't know.  What was the name of the show?  It was the Untitled Mike Birbiglia Project.  Who played the chick?  This girl, Christine Woods, who's on Kelsey Grammer's pilot, which might go this fall. 
[00:27:00]  She's real talented.  And like Bob Odenkirk played my brother.  And, you know, Mike Hitchcock played the vet.  And like it was like the mother from Six Feet Under played my mom.  It was like pretty surreal working with all these people.  So, yeah, that's all I got.  Were they hard on you, like the producers and stuff?  Yeah, I mean, it's hard to make it.  That's why I'm doing a one-person show in New York this fall because it's my show. 
[00:27:30]  And I get to decide what's in the show versus television where people just, it's like someone trying to find a vein in you at the hospital.  And you're just poking you and you're like, ah, okay, you know, you're just taking it.  Does that analogy make sense at all?  Yes, it reminds me.  It's like I like to do, that's why I like the freedom of stand-up.  Like my new CD, Edgy As I Wanna Be.  Edgy As I Wanna Be.  Bobby, how many years have you been on?  I'm not interviewing, I'm just kidding. 
[00:28:00]  What?  How many years have you been on?  I've been, this is my eighth year.  Damn, man.  Dude, this is it.  After this, I'm dead.  You're dead, yeah.  I'm like dead in the business.  Has anyone been on the whole time?  No.  Caliendo's gone, right?  Yeah, Caliendo left.  Everyone wants to leave once they're there.  Does he still have a sitcom, his own sitcom on CBS?  I just did a pilot myself, but I don't see him.  Oh, you did?  He's not gonna get picked, no.  Why would I get picked?  It's like weird.  What is it?  It's just like a lot of Asians dancing around naked and stuff.  You and Steve Byrne and Dr. Ken?  Yeah, Steve Byrne's like fully Asian.  He's like a light Mexican kind of looking. 
[00:28:30]  His father looks like, his father's real Irish.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's the Carlos Mencia of Asians.  Oh, you're gonna bring that up?  Please don't bring that up.  Let's say hi to John in Illinois.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I saw you on that video.  The video thing with him and Rogan, that thing comes up?  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, I'm not on this show, my friend.  You put it on the spot.  You guys are classy.  You put it on the spot.  But you brought it up.  I did.  Why did I bring it up?  Yeah.  Didn't you just bring it up?  I did.  I think I just did.  Yeah.  I didn't.  Shit. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you brought it up.  Let's just move on, please.  Hey, Bobby, you got anything boring to say?  This would be a good time for that.  Now, if Bobby had one answer fucking with, he would have said, yes, Mike for Big Mac.  God damn you, Bobby.  Thanks for helping them.  And, Robert, the reason why I play girls on the show is because it's a parody show.  There's not a lot of Asian dudes out there.  So whenever there's a girl, I got to play that girl.  The Asian girl.  No, I love when you play Asian girls.  You're actually cute. 
[00:29:30]  Oh, thank you.  Yeah, you play her real well.  Yeah.  Yeah.  In fact, if I was a chick, I'd get laid more.  Do Asian guys really have a problem getting pussy?  Because Asian women can...  Asian women fuck...  No, I talked to a couple of Asian guys about it.  Asian women will fuck black guys, white guys, Spanish guys.  Yeah.  But white girls won't fuck Asian guys.  That's not true.  That's not true.  Really?  That's absolutely not true.  So you bang white girls?  Yeah.  I mean, you know...  Do you bang Asian girls?  I bang all kinds of girls.  And the reason why...  Here's what it is.  It's this.  You got to do a launching pad.  And what a launching pad is, is I tell Asian dudes that haven't been laid, you get a prostitute 
[00:30:00]  first.  Right?  And that gets your shit moving.  Right?  And the girls sense that you're having sex.  And then they're in the game.  Every guy that I send to a prostitute to, they get laid.  Yeah.  Yeah.  From the prostitute.  You also lose $300.  I know you're paying.  Yeah.  No, I mean, after.  After.  Because they get into the routine of it.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Sometimes it takes 30 times.  Wow.  You know what I mean?  You go to Tijuana, right? 
[00:30:30]  It's $60.  You go to Adelisa.  Tijuana's disgusting.  Just listen, Robert.  I went to Tijuana and the girl had a white nougat on her asshole.  And then she turned around and goes, go ahead.  If you want to, go ahead.  Lick it.  I was like, I almost puked.  You know me.  Ugh.  What was it?  I like when they bring out the Bob Kelly with a bridle and have it fuck one of the women  on stage.  Oh.  It was actually called the Health Club.  Really?  Yeah, it was a Health Club, but they had two dumbbells and a thigh master.  That's what they had. 
[00:31:00]  Very good.  Heard that, Jimmy.  Hey, let's go back to Bobby Lee.  Explain what you did.  But I also think the Asian dudes, right, they're like, a lot of them are conservative and stuff.  And they, you know, they're doctors and they're in computers and stuff like that.  Right.  And there's, you have those Asians and then you have my kind of Asians.  I think those kind, you know, the kind of drug addicts and the, you know what I mean?  Opium guys, you know?  They, I think we kind of get girls.  So you go down to Tijuana to what place again?  Adelita and the Chicago Club.  Yeah.  It's on Kuala Lua Street. 
[00:31:30]  You know, they're across the street from each other.  And then back up Adelita, there's this place called Hooker Alley where all the underage  girls lean up, lean up against the wall.  Do they arrest you for that in Mexico?  Do they set you up and arrest you?  I'm surprised they don't buy people.  No, no, no.  They don't.  You walk down, you don't, I mean, if you go down Hooker Alley and you grab a girl, you're  going to hell.  Because those girls are too young.  But like, I've walked down it.  For hope.  What?  Too young for hope.  Yeah, exactly.  What are you talking about?  Mexican.  It's another country.  It's the metric system. 
[00:32:00]  That's right.  She's six kiloyers.  Let's go to John in Illinois.  John.  Hey.  Hey.  What's happening, fellas?  First of all, Opie and Anthony, I just want to thank you for everything that you've exposed  me to.  Octane, Jim Norton, Rich Boss, Lucky Louie.  I saw you, Jimmy, in Chicago in April.  You were frigging fantastic at the Lakeshore Theater.  Thank you.  Hotter than hell.  Thanks.  Yeah, well, yeah, it was really warm.  Huge fan, man.  I just, I love you guys so much.  I listen to you every day. 
[00:32:30]  All right.  Get to the point.  Not enough.  Bobby Lee.  Yeah?  I think is an awesome comedian.  The favorite skit that I like on Mad TV is when he was Tank.  Oh, Tank.  From the club pimping in his day wound.  Yeah.  Thank you.  All right.  You guys rock, man.  Thanks a lot.  I was going to ask you.  Take care, bro.  All right, John.  There was a distinct omission of me in that phone call, and I'm not going to point it out,  but...  What happened?  Well, he just kind of went around the room and complimented everybody.  All right.  Yeah.  Said nothing.  But I like that, I like the day wound sketch. 
[00:33:00]  I like the sound of that.  I love the new Burbiglia, man.  Don't you do that...  Don't you do that bit with the guy that looks like Mark Wahlberg there on the show?  Which one?  Do you mean Ike Berenholtz?  Who's the guy that looks like Mark Wahlberg?  Like Ike, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He left the show.  Eight years ago, right?  Yeah, yeah.  I love how we're all trying to prove that we watch his show.  No, we're proving we all watch it on Comedy Central.  No, nobody watches the show.  I realize I'm a part of a loser show, but it's just like, what am I going to do? 
[00:33:30]  I don't think anybody watches it first run, but I think we've all seen it on Comedy Central.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's why, you know.  And you're hilarious, dude.  No one's criticizing your credibility.  I understand.  I understand.  Thank you.  Here.  Here comes the hug.  Hey, where's the hug?  That was the hug.  What the?  Is Harry Spirits on?  No.  How many years was he on?  He was on for eight, too.  How long has he been gone?  He's been gone for like three years.  But let me tell you something.  That dude, that dude didn't say hi to me for three years.  We're all trying. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, I heard you had problems.  Did you have problems when you first got on the show?  Like they treat you like shit?  Dude, I showed up on the show and literally producers would say, dude, we're going to do everything  we can to get you off the show.  I didn't correct me.  Why?  Because they're like, we don't know.  You're not from Sketch.  You've never acted before.  We think that, you know what I mean?  Stand-ups don't work on the show.  And I literally, that first two years, that's why I went to rehab my second year because I  was just drugged out.  Wow.  Sketch people have this fucking arrogance.  Some of them are brilliantly funny.  But they have, you know, I've had enough of these motherfuckers. 
[00:34:30]  They have this arrogance.  They do Sketch, these faggots, because they can't stand alone on a stage most because they  have a fucking resentment against stand-ups.  And again, Sketch people, I have respect for it because what they do,  is an art, and it's hard.  But their resentments of stand-ups make me want to fucking spit in their faces.  Fuck you when you're fucking leaving somebody else up there.  Stand by yourself.  Is that a, are we cutting a commercial?  What is that?  I've heard that shit before.  They have this resentment against stand-ups.  Dude, and whenever I go up by myself in front of a live audience, I get off and all the  Sketch guys are like, you seem very comfortable on stage. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah, I'm a performer.  Yeah.  Like, I'm not afraid of them.  Yeah.  I don't have to pretend I'm in an office.  What was the drug that got you in the rehab?  I used to start drinking Vicodin, man.  Vicodin?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  I started drinking like 20 of them, 25 of them a day.  Really?  I started drinking.  Yeah.  Oh.  How often did you not shit?  You must have not shit.  The last, okay, two days before my last sketch, I quit doing Vicodin and I had to play Connie  Chung.  And this is, everyone knows, right?  So I'm in Connie Chung and I'm detoxing, right? 
[00:35:30]  I'm in front of a live audience and I'm shaking, right?  The lights come on.  The director goes, all right, action.  I go, good evening.  I'm Connie.  And then I shit my pants.  I shit my pants, right?  And then they go, cut.  And all the wardrobe come out and they're cleaning the shit off my nylons and stuff.  How'd they know you shit?  They heard it?  No, dude, you could smell it.  And I'm sweating and I'm shaking.  Then one of the producers, Dick Blasucci, walks up to me, starts screaming at me.  He goes, you're going to do it.  You're going to finish it.  Because the next day I was going to rehab, right?  It took me two hours to do a three-minute sketch. 
[00:36:00]  They did it line by line in front of 300 people.  Is that, can we watch that?  Is that out there?  Yeah, it's out there.  Just to know that you shit your pants?  No, there's an edited, that aired, but you can literally, it's the worst sketch I've  ever done.  Let's get it on TV.  Let's get it up here.  We got to watch it.  Hey, Bobby, I'm a fan of when you shit your pants, by the way.  Thank you.  That sketch where you shit your pants.  I'm a fan.  Remember when I had that bad toothache and I went upstairs to the dentist up there?  I do remember, yes.  And he wrote me a prescription for Vicodin. 
[00:36:30]  And I got it, went home, and I took one.  And the second it hit me, the first thing I did was count how many I had left.  I was like, one, two, three.  Okay.  That's amazing.  If I break one in half, and then I'll have more, and that shit is great.  How good is it for, because I got to get silent surgery in August, I don't know what  they're going to give me for pain, but I'm going to have to take something.  Don't take it.  Yeah.  I have to.  You shit.  Yeah, you're going to take it, but don't.  I'm an addict to the recovery.  I'm going to murder.  You're an addictive personality. 
[00:37:00]  Having my septum fucking straightening turbidate shake.  I took it when I took my knee, and I went through the shakes.  I'll take whatever they give me for medicinal.  I have to.  I'm not a martyr.  You need St. Joseph's baby aspirin.  What do you take for pain?  That's the only thing you can take, because you're an addictive personality.  You love everything.  I throw them out before the prescription is done.  Pick morphine.  It's light.  No, no.  I don't fuck with prescriptions.  No?  But when you get surgery, you've got to take it.  I'm not going to suffer and not take...  What, over-the-counter painkillers?  Well, what do some addicts do in your case?  Most of them will take the prescribed amount only. 
[00:37:30]  Take the pain.  Take the pain.  Take the pain.  You take the prescribed amount only, and you maybe have somebody help you out with it  and give it to you if you're married, or you fucking just throw them out.  Like, I'll always throw them out when the pain stops.  Are there people that refuse all pain medications because they're too scared?  I won't.  I don't know.  Maybe.  I hope that's what this is, but I don't fuck with that.  Yeah, Mormons and...  Well, you call your sponsor.  That's what I would do.  Yeah, you have to do.  Yeah, somebody, yeah.  I'm not going to suffer through fucking post-surgical pain.  No one ever expects you to do that.  Of course not.  Let's go to Kathy in South Carolina. 
[00:38:00]  Kathy.  Kathy.  Yeah.  Hello?  Hi, Kathy.  Talking about Vicodin and all sorts of shit.  Yes.  Waiting for Mike Birbiglia to hit somebody.  You know, we got a good one right now.  This is a good one.  Well, I'm talking about Bobby Lee's skits.  Uh-oh.  What, Betty?  My skits?  Bobby Lee's skits?  Yeah?  I'm here.  I'm like 24.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you very much.  She hasn't done that skit in five years.  No, no, no, no, no.  I do like two a year. 
[00:38:30]  But thank you.  Yeah, I watch the new ones that come on.  I don't watch the reruns.  Cool.  Do you like them or no?  Oh, I watch that instead of Saturday Night Live.  Oh, thank you.  That's a compliment.  What's your name, miss?  Kathy.  We're glad you watched the show, but on the phone, you're a real snooze fest.  I'm sorry.  I'm just kidding.  I'm from South.  I guess that's what, you know, we're like.  Hey, so nobody, Bobby, nobody was nice to you when you got there?  No, no, no.  It was the worst two, three years of my life.  And then what happened was, then like, you know, fans started going, we like the little guy. 
[00:39:00]  You know what I mean?  And then all of a sudden, it kind of changed.  And also, the old people left.  And then when the new people came in, then I was like.  You were there, right?  Yeah, I was already there.  And then you have a little power and stuff.  But, dude, the first two years, I literally was going to Virginia Tech the whole place.  Are you friends with Heidi for three years?  No.  Are you friends with her now?  Oh, no.  Yeah, I see him.  And then, you know, he grabbed my dad.  Oh, is that the bit?  Yeah, let's go.  Let's watch this.  It's on YouTube.  Is this the one?  Wow. 
[00:39:30]  I don't know if that's it.  It's TV, Connie Chung, and Joe Millionaire.  That's hilarious.  Is that the one we don't know?  No, no, no.  Aries and Moe were in it.  I don't think it's on YouTube, but that's me.  Everything's on YouTube.  Have they ever, on MADtv, have they ever considered casting Alfred E. Newman as an actor?  Is that funny?  Please hold me.  Dude, we have nothing to do with MADtv magazine.  Oh, you don't?  No, I mean, they bought the rights to the name, but then like, all that other stuff.  I didn't even know that. 
[00:40:00]  I was just going to use it as a platform for my bad jokes.  Let's say hi to Elizabeth in Philly.  Elizabeth, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, Jimmy.  My mother-in-law just had this surgery on her sinuses, and for like two weeks afterwards,  she sounded like a whistle.  It was pretty funny.  It's the moments like that, right?  And happy birthday, baby.  Thank you.  Oh, she called you baby.  She sure did. 
[00:40:30]  Is your mother-in-law breathing better, though, your mother-in-law?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What was that again?  Is your mother-in-law breathing better?  I think so.  I really can't stand her.  I wish she would stop breathing, but yeah, she is breathing.  Oh, wow.  The real dirt comes out, huh?  Yeah, so I hope you do well with your surgery, babe.  Thank you, ma'am.  All right.  Let's see.  All right.  Bye.  Fucking mensch.  Well, she's better now.  Hope the old cunt was killed by a drunk driver.  Hell, you're on one.  Yeah, I was going to call and say, Bobby Lee, you're a fucking genius, man. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, thanks.  My favorite skit is Average Asian.  That shit is hilarious.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Well, Average Asian was one of those things.  It was during the time when no one liked me.  So that was the only thing that they would give me is this thing called Average Asian  where stereotypes would come up and I'd be like, I don't know what's going on, you know.  But thank you very much.  How many weeks a year do you guys shoot?  Do you want an episode a week for how many weeks?  Well, it used to be 22 and now it's only 14. 
[00:41:30]  This year they gave us only 14.  It's done after this year.  I cannot see it coming back.  Really?  Yeah.  Literally, dude, there's homeless people sleeping outside my dressing room.  There's no security.  I don't even know what's going on.  I can't even get in, you know.  Wow.  It sounds like XM ghetto.  You would have done really well in the 80s during that period where there's always an Asian  character in movies like in Real Genius.  Like the Asian guy lives in the dorm.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Who makes it like a skating rink in the hallway.  It's a great movie. 
[00:42:00]  Does your money drop?  No, that's why.  Go do it.  That's the only reason why I do it.  You know, it's just because they go, here's this.  And I'm like, all right, I'll take it.  Are you still doing the Kims of comedy?  No, they kicked me out of the group.  They kicked you out?  They kicked you out?  What's the Kims of comedy?  It's Steve Burns' group.  Yeah, it's all Asians that tour the country.  Yeah, well, it was mine, and then I got kicked out, and now it's Steve.  Who kicked you out?  Why?  Steve.  Well, me and Steve are very good friends, and I love them.  But I wouldn't do like, you know, they were doing this. 
[00:42:30]  Do you like the fact that his hair looks like a Lego person to make?  That fucking hairdo should be removed.  Horrendous.  I wouldn't do this, like, you know, this college showcase, you know, for free.  You know how they do those, what do they call them?  Nackas?  Nackas?  Yeah.  You've got to fly for free to showcase, and I'm like, we're not doing that.  I mean, we proved that we can sell out.  You know what I mean?  Why would we have to showcase?  And that was the reason you left the group?  No, they were like, well, if you don't do the showcase, then you can't reap the benefits 
[00:43:00]  of us doing, you know, getting the gigs from the show.  Well, aren't you the biggest name, though, being on TV?  So wouldn't your name on the bill be a benefit that they couldn't contribute?  Yeah, someone could just throw money for your flight.  Who cares?  I know.  But the thing is, is that now, but now I talked to Steve three days ago, and, you know, we're  going to do some days again.  Who else is on it?  Steve, and who else?  Dr. Ken, you know him?  Dr. Ken's really funny.  He's very funny.  And this kid named Kevin Shane, nobody knows him.  I know Kevin.  I love him.  I know Kevin.  What do you think of people getting in trouble for doing stereotypical humor, Bobby Lee? 
[00:43:30]  Dude, like, I used to be Mencia's opening act, so it's just like, that's how I was  raised, to seeing that kind of stuff, so I don't really know.  It's weird, because it's like, now, like, there's a lot of New York guys that move to  L.A., and I've learned more from them, like, guys like Bill Burr, than I have from L.A.  comics, you know what I mean?  Because, you know, it's like sitting there, it doesn't have, you don't have to have a punch  line.  And before, like, you know, I was so worried about killing, you know what I mean, like  Mencia does, that now it's like, I'd rather just kind of take my time and be more 
[00:44:00]  honest and stuff, you know?  What do you learn from Bill, how to repress childhood memories and not fucking, and not  bite the face of people around you?  Not there, it was good.  Yeah, Bill Burr, we love him.  I asked that, because Richard Belzer disappointed the hell out of me, I was watching the last  comic standing, I literally watched, like, two episodes, and I caught this one, where  there was a Korean woman.  Yeah, Esther Koo.  Doing all Korean humor, getting huge laughs, and they had no problem with it, because 
[00:44:30]  she's Korean.  Yeah.  Then you had this white guy do this whole, like, Asian, stereotypical bit, and Richard  Belzer gave the guy a talking to, saying that type of humor doesn't fly in 2008.  Right.  I couldn't believe Belzer would go down that road.  Do we have tape of that?  Was he saying that?  I've been trying to find this clip to play on the show.  It's got to be, at the last comic standing, it's got to be gettable.  I mean, was he saying it was a pointy bit, or was he saying it was, like, inappropriate?  It was inappropriate, stereotypical humor from a white guy doesn't fly in the year  2008, and I'm like, wow, that's weird, and then two comedians later, it's the Korean 
[00:45:00]  girl doing pretty much the same type of stuff.  Yeah, she's funny, but my problem with her is that if you do stereotypical stuff about  your own race, you have to be positive.  You have to, you know what I mean, you have to make Asians look good.  She doesn't.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, and she rips on all the negative stuff, and her bit about, like, how Asian guys, like  you were saying, you know, Asian guys, we're going to be, Asian guys are going to be extinct  because no one wants to have sex with them.  I mean, you can't see shit like that.  It's fucking hilarious and true. 
[00:45:30]  No, no, no, no, no, no.  He's a white guy.  He's pretty funny.  It's based in fact.  Cute Asian girl.  Applause break.  It's based in fact and funniness.  Bobby's right.  Sit down.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Bobby.  Bobby, come back.  Bobby Lee got his biggest laugh by quoting another female Asian comedian.  Bobby was looking for our support on that one.  That's a hilarious joke.  Chicks always want to fuck Asian guys, man.  At least there's a lot of Asian porn.  That's for sure.  Not one Asian porn guy with white chicks. 
[00:46:00]  But he's got that great solution with the hookers.  I mean, it's covered, right?  It's the launching pad.  It works.  The launching pad.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, I don't know why.  It's always got a...  Is this the cool hot?  Is she a hot chick?  She's hot, yeah.  She's smuggish.  She wears tiny little skirts, and...  Ooh, I like that.  She plays up her hotness, yeah.  She's a nice little asshole, I bet.  I bet it's...  I don't know what that means.  Do we have any other material?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Asian people are not hairy.  Yeah, but they have that...  Their skin is different than their asshole. 
[00:46:30]  It's like grayer.  Yeah.  It's like really white skin, and then...  Right now, their asshole, and their thigh's gray.  And the genitals are...  Like, my genitals are, like, now getting black.  Wait, wait.  Ew, are they?  Yeah, yeah.  Yes, she is.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  So, my parents are from Korea, and I went to Korea once.  It was really weird.  Everybody was Korean.  And my relatives came to pick me up.  I got in the wrong car, like, ten times. 
[00:47:00]  You guys think you can't tell us apart?  We can't tell either, you know?  I doubt that.  She looks fuckable.  Oh, she's...  So, but I'm glad I'm here.  Asian girls are dangerous in the States, you know?  Yeah?  I mean, seriously, does anybody in here not have an Asian fetish?  See what I mean?  What?  There's one guy up there?  What is he, gay? 
[00:47:30]  I want to date Esther too.  I want her to be my girlfriend.  I don't know if you guys at home can see this,  but there's this guy up here.  He looks like he's surprised to see an Asian in pigtails  without punching in his credit card number.  That's fucking funny.  That's a funny guy.  Oh, this is good.  But seriously, white Asian girls are going out with, like,  white guys, black guys, you know?  Everybody but Asian guys.  That's fucking true.  Why's she got a hate? 
[00:48:00]  You know, like, what's going to happen to Asian guys?  They're going to go extinct or something?  As they sit at home playing video games?  I'm going to kill her.  Like, I feel bad.  He didn't even quote her best joke and it killed.  But, like, not bad enough to date them.  You know what?  If your dick was big enough, I'd choke her with it.  Like, last week this Asian guy asked me out,  and I was just like,  jeez, when are they going to realize  that Asian girls are just way out of their league?  That's daddy anger.  And my girlfriends, they're always asking me, 
[00:48:30]  they're like, how do you stay so skinny?  And I always tell them, just do what we do, you know?  Eat with chopsticks.  That feels stock.  We can't pick much up with those things either.  It's all stocky.  Yeah.  And then shove it down your throat and throw up.  I love her.  She's very fuckable, though.  She's great.  She's doing a fucking,  no one can tell him a part joke,  a Bolivia joke,  a fucking, a strip off on a one joke.  I mean, it's an ancient Korean secret  that dog is, like, 25% more lean than turkey. 
[00:49:00]  You still love her?  Duh.  More.  Actually, I don't even know how to use chopsticks.  Like, I'm completely American.  I was born here.  I mean, I'm so American,  I'm against immigration.  Because I'm here already.  And I ordered Chinese yesterday,  and a Mexican guy delivered it.  She's like an Asian Sarah Silverman. 
[00:49:30]  With her attitude.  Sarah Silverman.  I was like, what is going on here?  This is so sexy.  They're taking all of her jobs.  I was like, what's next?  Dry cleaning?  Nail salons?  Massage?  And I opened up the fortune cookie.  It said, Confucius say,  no hablo ingles.  I want to put her in a wedding dress 
[00:50:00]  and just shit in her mouth.  I was like, this is crazy.  I have to get him back.  So tomorrow, I want to apply for a drive  at Taco Bell.  Like, you want sweet and sour sauce  with your chalupa?  So it's cool being here.  Whenever I miss my grandparents, though,  I could always turn on the TV  and watch reruns of MASH.  Me so funny.  All right, thank you, guys. 
[00:50:30]  I'm Esther Koo.  I like her, man.  Esther Koo, yes.  But every joke has something to do  with her being Korean,  and that can't be part of your joke.  The whole thing.  It's the entire act.  I mean, I do half of it,  but it's just like, you know.  I love that Bobby comes in,  and he's like,  I got a real issue with this Esther Koo.  You play it, everyone's like,  yeah!  It's rules!  When's the album coming out?  She's cute.  She's everything.  I know.  You're just...  I'm wrong.  Baby, I'm wrong.  She reminds me of a black...  You know the black girl, Esther Koo?  Oh, Jesus. 
[00:51:00]  Well, we can goof on Asians.  Of course we can.  You like Asian chicks?  No, I don't have a fetish for any girl,  but she was great.  I enjoyed it very much.  No, I've slept with, like,  two Asian girls in my life.  Typically, no.  We've got to find the bells.  That's one more than me, man.  Really?  I like that French comedian,  Esther Koo, they're tough.  Ladies and gentlemen,  I will be appearing.  She's crazy, though.  There's no dates to speak of.  She's always chilly. 
[00:51:30]  It's Esther Koo.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  That's one bit.  But Bells just said it's okay  if you're a part of that group  to make fun of it.  Oh, of course.  That's the way humor  should be broken down.  That's some fucking bullshit.  Of course.  That's a terrible idea.  I like Bells,  but it's like,  oh, Richard.  All right, let's go to Joey  in Louisiana.  Joey!  What's going on, Rob?  How do you do, Joe?  Hey, Joey!  Hey, man, big fan.  O&A.  Bob Kelly, love you.  Happy birthday, Jimmy. 
[00:52:00]  Thank you.  I don't know who this Mike guy is,  but Bobby...  Thanks, man.  All right, peace.  Bobby Lee.  Yeah.  Hey, man,  25 a day?  Bike it in.  Yeah, I don't do it now.  I mean, how the hell  did you keep up  with 25 a day, my man?  Well, you know,  I was on a show, right,  so I had a little bit  of money at that time,  and, like,  I just spent it all on drugs.  I had, like,  three or four people 
[00:52:30]  I went to in L.A.,  and all the sketch guys.  Well, I can't remember.  I was revealed to him.  I was like,  wow, it's...  And, uh,  yeah, but I quit, dude.  I was going to die.  You talk,  a lot of girls,  like, watch your show.  You get star pussy.  That's good.  No, I haven't been late  in five months, actually.  Come on.  Five months.  My choice, probably, right?  Yeah, yeah,  because I was in a relationship  and so I did so much  the whole thing.  Are you taking, like,  a little time for you?  Well, no,  you know,  I'd rather jerk off, honestly.  It's nice, right?  Patrice was saying that yesterday.  No, I...  Patrice O'Neill said  the exact same thing.  He said he's reaching 
[00:53:00]  the point where  the pussy isn't like  it was when he was  in his 20s,  where it was the be-all,  do-all, end-all  of everything.  The chase isn't worth  the actual coming of it,  you know what I mean?  Like, sometimes you chase  for 10 hours and stuff,  and it's just like,  and after you nut,  you're like,  that's it?  You know what I mean?  So I'd rather just  do it right then,  get the juice out,  and then move on  with my life.  They like to call it  the poison.  Oh, the poison, yeah.  You should spice it up.  You should just come  inside them  and see what happens.  It mixes things up.  Let's strangle them  a little bit.  Oh, really? 
[00:53:30]  Yeah, you still get  kickier.  But you know what?  You've got to manipulate,  and sometimes you've got  to buy dinner  and all that stuff,  and it's just like,  it's a whole thing.  You have to buy dinner still?  You're fucking famous,  and you've got money,  and you still have to  buy him dinner?  You can't just say,  come to my pad?  When you're on SNL,  you don't have to buy him dinner,  but on that TV  after a long dinner.  Let's say hi.  You're not...  Oh, shit.  Let's say hi  to David in Michigan.  David.  Oh, and hey,  before I found you guys  and was turned  to the wonderful  dark side of your humor, 
[00:54:00]  I listened to  fucking Bob and Tom.  I heard Mike Birbiglia  on there,  and I thought,  yeah, he's okay.  He's kind of funny.  But I'll tell you what,  the dark side Mike Birbiglia  fucking rocks.  I love it.  This is a different side  of you today, Mike.  It's early.  It's before I'm really awake.  Yeah.  He's getting his chops.  I love it.  All right, cool.  Hey, this is Mike Birbiglia,  and you're listening  to the worst  of Opie and Anthony.  I'm not sure why  I'm announcing that,  but you're listening to it.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:54:30]  You're listening  to the worst worst.  Hey, this is Richard Dreyfuss,  and you're listening  to the worst  of Opie and Anthony.  This is the fucking worst  of Opie and Anthony.  That's pretty stupid.  Time for the line of the day.  That fast already.  Oh, shit.  Bobby, you enjoy  your first visit  for the Opie and Anthony show?  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Yeah.  Did you guys make up?  Yeah.  No, we're cool, man.  He's, yeah.  It was weird.  It's like we're friends. 
[00:55:00]  I don't know, man.  That's what I said.  That was my point.  Yeah.  From the get-go.  We hung out.  You were drunk.  I haven't seen you guys  in a while.  Thanks for having me on.  Were you feeling  really hurt  that he didn't hug you?  Like a little bit?  Like you just lighted?  Yeah, a little bit.  Dude.  Give him a really good hug.  Like, right now?  Really good.  Dude, you should see everything.  You want to see  the underwear  I'm wearing right now?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Get naked.  Bobby.  I did Bobby.  Give.  Give.  Oh, my God.  I was packing.  I had nothing clean. 
[00:55:30]  So I just put these on.  You want to hug now?  Those aren't yours.  You want to hug now?  Bobby.  Bobby.  Those aren't yours.  They are mine.  No, they're not.  Yes, they are, Robert.  You got a pink trim toe.  Bobby.  Bobby.  Bobby.  Wait.  We can't just casually.  Dude, I didn't put them on  like I'm going to wear  this on opening Anthony.  No, I just like.  No, I know you don't, Bobby.  Every time I see you,  you always take your clothes off,  which is what I love about you.  I don't care.  But are those really  men's underwear?  Yes, they're men's underwear. 
[00:56:00]  Okay.  Just to explain to people  listening, your underwear  is like black and white  striped women's underwear  with a pink trim.  Yeah.  And there's a little pink trim.  And they're a little too tiny  on the sides.  Yeah.  I should have shown them.  They're very bikini-ish.  I should have shown them.  They look good.  My bad.  I apologize.  I think they look good.  You still haven't hugged Mike, though.  All right, I'll do it now.  I thought you were going to  hug him the underwear,  but I guess we don't get that.  I don't, um.  See, everything's okay.  I don't care what kind of underwear  Mike slapped him on the back  like, oh, I'm not a faggot.  That was not as good as...  Hold on, hold on.  Anthony says he doesn't care  what kind of underwear  people wear.  Underwear people?  I don't, it doesn't bother me. 
[00:56:30]  Why the fuck?  Thank you.  I know, but thank you.  It's a little girly, though.  I thought it was a little  feminine looking,  but who gives a fuck?  Would you wear panties?  I'd wear a fucking, like,  sack panties.  What are you doing right now?  He's in my bag.  He wears boxers.  You wear boxers.  I think everybody else  wears boxers.  I prefer briefs.  Tidy bodies.  Boxers don't help  after you piss  to keep the piss  from going down  your fucking,  to your kneecap.  Shaking does.  What about boxer briefs?  No, no.  I messed up.  It's a good talking point. 
[00:57:00]  You guys are going to  talk about it later.  I just don't know  what you're wearing.  What happened?  No, like, tomorrow  you guys are going to  talk about my underwear.  Like, how you're skiing  and all that stuff.  Oh, shit.  No, not.  No, we won't tomorrow.  Why would we do that?  I thought I was comfortable  that we were all friends.  I just showed them, man.  I like them.  No, man.  There's a vibe here now.  There's a vibe.  Let me see him again.  What, really?  Yes.  He's underwear.  Dude, what do you want?  Put your pants up in the back.  Pull them up in the back.  Pull them up in the back.  Pull them up in the back. 
[00:57:30]  Bobby's like,  pull them up.  Let me get a picture.  Let me get a picture.  That's kind of...  More of the coffee cup, too.  Jim.  Bobby, move the coffee cup.  That's funny a little bit.  What?  Yeah, I like the coffee cup.  That's funny a little bit.  I'm getting your picture.  Hold on a minute.  Bobby, look over here.  Yeah, I'm seeing like a...  It's a zebra stripe kind of a thing.  And Marky Marky says that all the time.  I need these.  But then the pink trim is a little odd.  It's just the pink trim,  but you know what?  They're punk rock, dude.  Yeah, they're punk.  Yeah, they're punk.  I like them.  Thanks, man.  I really appreciate the hug, though, Bobby. 
[00:58:00]  I got him a Hot Topic.  He got him a Riggies.  That's fucking racist.  That's fucking racist.  What?  Forever 21?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, big rig causes a mess.  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  My underwear caused that.  It's different.  Bobby, you're going to have to come back tomorrow.  You come back tomorrow if you're around  and you're not doing anything.  Yeah.  I just want to give you the invite.  That didn't mean get the fuck out now.  Why?  Yeah, sit down.  The show's not done yet.  I don't know how it works.  We stay until when they get up and leave.  This is my first time.  Bob Kelly, he read that perfectly, by the way. 
[00:58:30]  So now it's really awkward.  What is that?  Bobby Lee.  That was his out.  What?  It's weird now.  What's going on?  I should leave?  Why is it silent?  Because I bombed horribly.  I don't even think you're kidding.  It's all about timing.  Maybe I shouldn't have waited two minutes before I bring back something. 
[00:59:00]  And Mike, you got your stuff on iTunes.  I'm competing with Rob Kelly.  I got two albums.  And you got an off-Broadway thing that's happening.  You got two and I got a DVD.  What about the off-Broadway thing?  Oh, yeah.  Sleepwalk with me.  Me and Mike are going to be number one and two today.  Yeah.  We're going to go up the charts above Bo Burnham.  Yeah.  Bo and Dane Cook.  Dane Cook has all four.  Four in the top seven or something.  Yeah.  Something like that.  Boy, that guy really makes a pretty penny.  Hey, Roland bought one of those shirts, by the way.  We didn't talk about it on the air. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  The Dane Cook shirt.  What was that all about?  Yeah, he was on Jimmy Kimmel and he was like, I can say anything today and then tomorrow  it's on YouTube and then everybody has it.  Yeah, I could say A, semicolon, what is it?  Don't ask me.  A6.  And tomorrow there'll be a shirt.  There'll be shirts out there.  And the next day, it was all over the internet.  And then he had shirts.  And now Roland has one.  That's not a semicolon, though.  That's a colon.  That is a full colon.  But Roland got one of the shirts.  This is a Dane Cook shirt. 
[01:00:00]  This is the shirt that he made up on the spot on Jimmy Kimmel and people are buying them.  He just made up that saying and then now he probably made, what, $20,000?  How much did that shirt cost?  $20,000?  $45,000.  $45,000.  Did you know what you were buying?  $45,000.  He made $45,000.  $45,000.  Jesus.  Roland, did you know what you were buying?  No, it was soft.  I bought it.  It was soft, so you bought it.  What concert?  Why don't you try his concert?  At the Garden.  Oh, fuck.  At what concert?  That's a good one.  Yeah.  Did I get you?  Yeah.  Whose concert?  Dane Cook when he did The Garden. 
[01:00:30]  You didn't know what that meant?  No.  I know what that meant.  You did?  No.  Because I saw him on Kimmel.  That's why.  You best not fuck.  Bobby, where are you going?  He's turning.  You all right?  Yeah.  Where are you going?  Where are you going?  I started having a panic attack, man.  Why?  No, I started breathing.  I started sweating.  I got to get out.  Yeah.  I had a breathing thing.  So we'll fucking deal with it.  Xanax is not wrong.  No, I started getting it like I was...  He's sweating.  He turned red.  They're not coming in.  They're fine.  He was freaking out because we weren't talking about him. 
[01:01:00]  No, that's not what it was, man.  We didn't get the whole big game, cooking, and then all of a sudden I don't know what  was going on.  You're on Vicodin?  Oh, jeez.  Dude, he's sweating really bad.  And he turned...  Your color came back.  Well, you were a different color.  You were red.  I was pink, and now I'm yellow again?  Yeah, you're back to yellow.  Oh, no.  I'm sorry about that.  Mike thinks you were looking for attention.  Well, ask for kook and do it.  I can.  You can do whatever you want.  Mike thinks you were looking for attention.  You got to deal with those panic attacks there, Bobby?  No, no.  I was actually going to leave.  I understand where you're coming from.  I have that too, man.  Where are you going?  Where are you going?  Bobby, where are you going?  Bobby.  My thing cut off. 
[01:01:30]  Bobby.  Bobby, sit down.  You get panic attacks?  Yeah.  I get that.  I don't know.  I don't know.  He just got up and started panicking, sweating.  His face turned beet red, and he was walking out of here.  It's called a panic attack.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You all right?  I'll find out.  You all right?  Someone just handed him the ratings for Mad TV.  Oh, God.  Jesus.  Wow, you are fucking brutal, man.  Look, man, I don't even have a show. 
[01:02:00]  I'm just making funny.  I don't have your career.  Come on.  I don't have a...  Is this on?  Can you hear me?  Oh, yeah.  Why, your headphones aren't working?  Nothing's working.  That's what happened.  No, the headphones aren't working.  Hey, anyone else...  Probably need another battery in there, son of a bitch.  Anyone else feel that?  What?  How was that?  Oh, my God.  You feel the room shake?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What was that?  Earthquake.  What was that?  I have no idea.  I'm not sure Steve dropped the ball again.  Bobby, you feel that?  Wow.  No. 
[01:02:30]  Were you sweating?  You didn't feel the room shake?  Oh, my God.  I'm getting dizzy.  Yeah, it feels like a little bit earthquake.  Yeah, that was weird, dude.  What the hell was that?  You can't have...  You all right?  That's weird.  In New York City, Jesus.  You felt that?  Yeah, dude, that's weird.  Nothing.  Why don't we just try to end this as quick as we get to the phone?  Yeah, come on.  Let's just do it.  You all right, Bobby?  Yeah, you said the shaking.  It's fine.  It stopped.  It was shaking, though.  Mars, why?  This is a floating room, right?  Yes.  Yeah, the room floats, so... 
[01:03:00]  It's suspended?  Yeah.  We're going to be safe?  Yeah.  Okay.  You sure?  We'll see.  Oh.  What do you mean, we'll see?  You went from yep to we'll see to what?  No?  To nowhere goners.  Bobby, you know what's really weird about this studio?  What?  There's a fucking 40-story crane right outside this building, and man, if one of those brackets  goes...  Did you hear that?  It happened to not...  It goes right through the fucking studio.  It happened in Israel the other day.  It was by Terrace.  Look out Anthony's window.  I'm not kidding.  Terrace did it.  You've got to see this, Bobby.  It freaks us out every day.  Look at this thing.  That's not good. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah, those things...  I've got to go.  Those things fall down all the time.  No, honestly, I'm like...  There's some weirds going on there.  We're almost done.  This is not working.  No, it's not.  It says your headphones.  Your headphones aren't working.  He's right.  The mic's not working.  Morris, can you fix his mic?  It's not working.  I can't hear nothing.  Yeah.  Are we still on?  Are we on the air?  What's going on?  We haven't been on the air in 15 minutes.  Oh, we haven't?  No.  You can leave.  It's good meeting you.  Bobby. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, are you mad now?  Fucking Bobby.  We love you, man.  Take a deep breath.  That's water.  Yeah, get some water in you.  You know, the studio shook a little bit, and we got a crane that might topple over.  We're cool.  Hasn't toppled over yet, so I don't think today's the day.  No, but that happens, like, a lot for me.  It's hot in here.  Well, I just start sweating and stuff, and it's weird.  Anyone else see the cockroaches?  Yeah.  They're fucking...  Don't get rid of them.  Boy, I hate cockroaches, dude.  Where the fuck are cockroaches? 
[01:04:30]  Cockroach.  The studio has been infested with them because of construction.  Yep.  Yeah, the construction and the fucking disgusting, deplorable conditions over by that refrigerator.  The food was, like, snotty smashed against the fucking door.  They live in chairs.  It's a mess, wasn't it?  These chairs.  They live in chairs.  Because they go in...  What the fuck are you talking about?  The stuffing of the chairs is where they live in chairs.  That's where they lay their eggs, in chairs.  You're out of your fucking mind.  Swear to God.  Google it.  Google it.  Swear to God.  They live in walls. 
[01:05:00]  Swear to God.  Couches.  They live everywhere.  First of all, they live fucking everywhere.  But they live, like, under cabinets, in cabinets, in the walls.  They don't live in chairs.  But they can't live in chairs is what he's saying.  Not in balls' chair.  Nothing can live in his chair.  They lay eggs in mattresses and things.  It is true.  I like furniture.  I liked it a lot, actually.  Well, yeah, because they're everywhere.  They're fucking cockroaches.  But they don't fucking scurry to the chair when you turn the light on.  Maybe I was being serious.  Maybe I was just playing along with the game and trying to, you know...  No, there's really a lot of... 
[01:05:30]  You can fuck with me?  There's really...  I don't know, Anthony.  Someone bring in a cockroach.  Maybe you can just stick to the plan.  See, that's what's making me sweat.  I'm literal and...  This whole banter.  This whole thing.  The fuck...  What is that?  What was that?  What are you talking about?  Did you see that?  What happened?  I want to eat...  What?  What the fuck is going on?  Did the building just shake?  What?  I felt something.  I got a piss.  Bobby, honestly, though, there are cockroaches in here.  I got a piss.  First of all...  Hold on.  Honestly, that drop ceiling, that's... 
[01:06:00]  We know there's cockroaches up in there, so just be careful above your head.  But something is moving or something.  It's weird.  Keep the fucking shit over there, as far as the cockroaches are concerned, because we haven't  seen any in the studio yet.  And if I see one in this fucking studio, because I do not want to have shit come home with me.  Plus, you get stuffy.  That's for sure.  Yeah.  Because that's what'll happen.  You bring a bag in here from home.  I gotta get out of here, man.  Where are you going?  What's wrong?  Something weird is happening.  I don't know.  I think I'm tired or something.  What are you talking about?  Tired?  No, I didn't sleep well last night.  I had, like, two hours of sleep. 
[01:06:30]  And I'm literally, like...  My whole thing is, like...  What, your EQ?  Did this thing move?  What are you talking about?  Are you all right, dude?  Are you flipping out?  No, I'm flipping out.  Are you flipping out?  I gotta get out of here.  What's wrong with you?  Dude, I'm losing my mind, man.  Sit down.  Guys, I'm sweating, man.  You are sweating.  There is something going on here.  The 20,000-pound console.  First of all, I just want to say...  We're probably off the air.  That's fine.  No, we're not.  We're on the air.  We're on the air?  Yeah, we told you that.  First of all, let me just say this.  The mic is not working.  I can't hear myself. 
[01:07:00]  We can hear you.  And then, I just, my whole, like, level of...  Like, I feel like something's shaking or something's going on.  No, something did shake in the studio.  But that was a while ago.  I have to piss.  Is everything cool?  Yeah.  Look, there was...  Does the air have headphones?  I feel like I'm...  I just saw it.  You're a dog.  Why are you freaking me out?  Bobby.  Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.  Bobby.  Bobby Lee's leaving the studio.  Bobby, relax.  Is the cable moving?  No.  How can I do this?  Is the cable moving?  This is a half ton.  How can we keep the floor things moving? 
[01:07:30]  Hey, dude.  Just sit down.  Relax.  You're freaking me out.  You're freaking me out.  Just be fine, man.  Chill out, dude.  Chill out just a little bit.  It's all good.  Look, I'm checking email.  How could all hell be breaking the list if I'm checking email?  Are you on Sally D?  Yeah, maybe...  Sally D.  You guys want to do...  Timmy went to the bathroom.  Bobby Lee thinks things are moving around in the studio.  Is it floors or something?  No.  No.  Everything's good, Bobby.  All right.  Bobby's probably...  Because I've been tired, too.  And my equilibrium gets a little fucking thrown. 
[01:08:00]  Wait, where do you have ice cream?  Oh, no, no.  Yeah, yeah.  You have a problem.  Okay.  But his headphones aren't working.  We can hear you on mic.  Don't worry about that.  All right.  It's fine.  Okay.  And watch out.  Honestly, that drop ceiling does have cockroaches.  We haven't seen any today yet.  The ceiling drops?  Well, it is a drop ceiling already.  Yeah, sorry.  So.  Anyone else see the beekeeper?  All right.  That's it.  This is moving now.  I just saw it.  I... 
[01:08:30]  Listen.  Oh, my God.  He's listening.  It's mine.  That's messed up because, listen.  How could this thing move?  Look how big this thing is, Bobby.  It's either that or I'm going crazy, dude, and I need to go and take a nap.  What are you seeing, really?  Seriously.  I'm seeing either the floor is moving up, or this is moving, or I'm literally like...  Bobby, you see how big this table is and all this equipment?  How is all this going to move?  Seriously.  Why is everybody leaving the building?  Huh?  Why is all these...  The office is empty now. 
[01:09:00]  All right, dude.  I got to get out of here, dude.  Are you serious?  Are they all in front of me?  There's something going on.  Honestly, thank you so much for having me on.  Where are you going?  Bobby.  I got to get out of here, man.  For what?  No, there's something going on here.  Uh-oh.  Where are they?  No, no, no, no.  Dude, why is everyone leaving?  See, that's the thing.  Oh, crap.  People are leaving.  I got to leave.  When people leave, I leave.  You know what I mean?  Why?  I don't let them leave.  Dude, they're just leaving.  Hey, did you sleep at all last night?  What's wrong with this? 
[01:09:30]  I'm just staring at him trying to figure him out.  Oh, shit.  All right, can we do line of the day?  Yeah, let's do line of the day.  Let's get Bobby out of here.  Why did the audience leave?  What?  I'm leaving.  Am I acting crazy?  What?  Am I acting crazy right now?  No, I mean, I don't know.  Are you all right?  I don't know.  I don't know.  You're fine.  Nah, everybody's fine.  Look at it.  Oh, fuck.  What happened to the TVs?  Oh, shit.  No video signal. 
[01:10:00]  What the fuck's that about?  Oh, that's fucking great.  Oh, jeez.  Now, I think I'm going to go.  This is like a fucking submarine.  Mike, where are you going, Mike?  It's like a submarine fucking...  It's like a power pitch.  Wait a minute.  No, no, no, no.  Mike, I've got to go.  Guys, wait.  No.  I've seen this on the news and stuff.  Promote your show, dude.  No, I already did it.  It's like a fucking...  Bobby, Bobby.  You guys are going to talk like...  It's like a submarine with a hull breach.  Well, it is...  There's something weird definitely going on.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  Mike, Mike Birbigli is preventing him from leaving.  Yeah, Mike's preventing him. 
[01:10:30]  I like that, actually.  We're going to just stay a couple more minutes, and then we'll go.  Bobby, come back.  We love you.  We want you to come back on the show.  Why are people leaving?  How are we playing a trick on you?  We're doing a radio show.  They left.  I don't know why.  The lights went out.  I don't know why.  We lost the TV signal.  I don't know why.  And I did feel something, but that was a while ago, and you're still seeing things.  But you did have a little panic attack before, so it's probably like the residuals. 
[01:11:00]  Oh, God.  All right.  Let's...  Are we almost ready for the line of the day?  Mm-hmm.  I hate being cut off like this.  Bob?  Yeah.  He's closing his eyes.  Yeah, relax a little bit, bro.  Yeah, chill out.  Breathe.  Yeah.  What's that?  All right.  What do we do?  Bobby, why are you covering your eyes?  I'm fine.  I'm going to smash you.  Are you okay?  What the fuck is that? 
[01:11:30]  Oh, my God.  What's what?  There's a bunny rabbit.  What?  Where?  Where's there a bunny rabbit?  I know this is like, you guys are doing tricks on me, man.  Where is there a bunny rabbit?  How could we be playing tricks on you, Bobby?  Not that type of broadcast.  What are you talking about?  You smell that?  No, there's a bunny rabbit.  Do you smell?  Where?  There's a bunny rabbit right there.  Where?  Robert, there's a bunny rabbit.  I can't see a fucking bunny rabbit, Bobby.  Are you fucking with me now? 
[01:12:00]  You're fucking with me.  You're fucking with me.  Dude, I know what's going on.  I know what's going on now.  And that's good that you did that.  All right, show us the bunny rabbit.  Where is there a bunny rabbit?  Show us the bunny rabbit.  Show me the bunny rabbit.  I'm with you.  Yeah, show us.  Show me the bunny rabbit.  Show us.  Out there somewhere?  All right, I'm leaving.  Where are you going?  I've got to get out of here.  Come on, Bobby.  Bobby.  Bobby.  Thanks for having me on the show.  Baby, wait.  All right.  Are you going to come back tomorrow?  All right.  Bobby.  All right, there goes Bobby Lee.  And he's looking for the bunny rabbit.  Bobby. 
[01:12:30]  Where are you going?  He ran out.  He ran out.  No, no, I'm going because there's something going on.  He ran out of the studio to go find the bunny.  No, no, no.  I've got to go.  What's wrong?  And the bunny...  No, no, no.  I love those guys.  I'm sweating.  I've got to get out of here.  I've got to go to sleep.  What are you doing?  They want to talk to me.  No, no, no.  I'm done.  They didn't say you can leave.  No, no.  They didn't say you can leave.  Rules are rules, man.  It's like there's no rules.  I've got to eat.  No, no, no.  I did.  I did it like two hours.  It was fine.  The funniest thing. 
[01:13:00]  Panic attack.  I've got to get out of here.  Is he coming back?  What are you doing?  No, no, no.  I wasn't going to go.  I'm going to go to the elevator.  All right.  Let him go on the elevator.  Yeah, what's up?  Tell him we're going to breakfast.  No, I can't come back, guys.  Why?  Because there's some sort of deception and some shadow play going on, and I'm not in on it,  and you know what?  I'm going to get you guys back.  What type of...  There's deception.  What type of shadow play is going on there that's fine? 
[01:13:30]  Ah, the elevator door's shut.  Oh, well.  He's done?  There he is.  Dude, he wasn't sure if the bunny rabbit was real, so he ran out of the studio, because  that was the only way he could figure it out, was to find the bunny rabbit, and whoever  was in the bunny rabbit suit to tear down a wall right now was able to hide, and he  never found the bunny rabbit, and that really just freaked him the fuck out.  You don't need to tear down the wall.  I don't think anybody thought there was a giant bunny rabbit.  Let me tear up the wall down here. 
[01:14:00]  But the thing I do want to add was, I was like, fuck, he's going to find the bunny, and  he never found the bunny.  Nice.  We don't treat our guests nicely.  Yeah.  We really don't.  And we were moving the console up and down.  That's the first time he was in here, with consoles moving up and down, and fake earthquake.  Yeah, you're going to get him back in tomorrow.  Hey, this is Isaiah Whitlock, Jr. You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[01:14:30]  Opie and Anthony.  We got to calm down, man.  I got to tell you right now.  The worst.  I am the worst.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  It is the worst.  The fucking worst of Opie and Anthony.  That's the worst idea I've ever heard in my life.  Get ready to listen to this roar. 
[01:15:00]  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  We got a huge crowd today here at XM Satellite Radio.  What the fuck happened?  We got Dr. Steve over there with his entourage.  Yes.  Is that your entourage over there, Dr. Steve?  Dr. Steve has an entourage.  I like that.  This show is more pottery than Howard Sturdy.  And, of course, and, of course, he has already begun.  Howard Sturdy can't meet this.  Holy shit, he said something intelligent. 
[01:15:30]  Howard Sturdy ain't gonna win.  Tippi Tom, everyone.  Let's hear it for Tippi Tom.  There are people on the bleachers wearing surgical masks.  And other kind of protective gear.  One guy has a shirt pulled over his nose.  Yeah.  There's surgical masks and people just putting their teeth.  Yeah.  Hey, get a mic on Tippi Tom.  I heard you in Mexico, he says.  Who was in Mexico, Tom?  Tippi.  Who was in Mexico?  Who was in Mexico?  What should I say?  Who was in Mexico? 
[01:16:00]  Well, a guy named Tippi Tom was in Mexico.  Let's see.  Who else is in Mexico?  Well, I think Opie and Anthony might be there.  But they're here in New York now.  I think.  Yeah.  I'm not sure.  Hey, Sam, I got to ask the guys behind.  How bad does Tippi Tom smell?  It really is bad because I walked in and I was amazed by how many people were here for  the show today.  And then all of a sudden I didn't see Tippi Tom, but I smelled them. 
[01:16:30]  That's how bad.  Tom.  Tom.  Tom, you stink.  You stink.  Well, nobody smells that good.  And so, you know, but I rule.  But I rule.  That's right.  I use root.  Hold on.  Give them a hug.  All right, Travis.  The funny thing about working for this show is that Danny and I both don't think he smells  that bad today.  But, like, just what we've known. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, you know something?  As opposed to the audience.  You're right.  No.  He doesn't smell as bad today as he has.  As soon as you walk in, you smell them, though, man.  But there have been, the last time he was in had to be the funkiest he ever was.  Well, Tippi, I heard Tippi say to somebody outside that he doesn't smell that bad because  he just took a bath three weeks ago.  Yeah, three weeks ago.  And he uses brute.  See, you guys don't get it because he, uh, you're not in close quarters with him.  When I bring him here in a car, it's horrendous.  You can't, you have to have all the windows open and your head out the window. 
[01:17:30]  Do you use your own personal car?  No, no, no, no.  Except for the one time I was returning Ange's lease, and I did put him in the back of the  car because that leasing company was scumbag.  So I put him in the back on the way.  You should have left him in there when you turn in the car.  Yeah.  Hey, what am I doing here?  Look at these guys.  They're just plugging up their, uh, noses, man.  You guys want Tippi Tom to leave the area?  Uh, please.  Tom's got a whole thing to himself, too.  I gotta tell you, yeah, Anthony has the observation. 
[01:18:00]  There's easily 40, 50 people out there, and the bleachers are packed.  There's, there's a ton of people standing in the back.  No, no one will sit on the front of the bleachers.  Yeah.  Or in the second row, even.  Yep.  You know where you should sit, Tom?  There's, uh, uh, maybe there's a little office in the back there where you could sit Tom for  a little while.  Because Ron and Fez like Tom.  I think you should bring Tom to the Ron and Fez office.  No, no, we're okay.  I'm smelling him now.  We're gonna have Tippi Tom change his clothes and, uh, Ron and Fez is on.  Yeah, exactly.  And he can leave his clothes in there.  That's how much we like those guys, you know. 
[01:18:30]  Can you buy me a beer?  Yeah, get him a beer.  Can you buy me a beer?  What is this, a bar?  It's Friday, Tom, right?  Don't forget your food, Tom.  Hey, hey, Sam.  Sam.  Sam.  Have Tom do a circle around the bleachers for everybody.  Yes, I do a circle around the bleachers.  Yes.  It's a photo op for everybody.  Because a lot of people bring cameras to the O.P. Anthony show.  Photo op.  Photo op.  Walk through the crowd, Tom.  Walk through the crowd.  Walk through the crowd.  Over here? 
[01:19:00]  No.  Walk through the crowd.  I want to talk to the radio.  Wait, walk around.  I'll take the mic.  Go that way.  Go that way.  Yeah.  Sam, follow him with the mic and then he'll follow you.  Yep.  All right.  Oh, he's walking.  There he goes.  Look at him.  Look at him.  He's walking through the crowd.  Oh, the crowd's horrified.  It looks like they're running with the balls in Spain.  The way they clear out of the light.  Where's he going? 
[01:19:30]  He's just wandering around.  Sam, what's going on?  That's Willy Wonka.  People are taking off their shirts and fanning the air toward Tom.  Actually, Tippi insisted that you guys wanted him to sing a song and that I wanted him to sing a song.  Okay.  So he's serenading me with some of the tunes from Willy Wonka.  All right.  Let's hear a song there, Tom.  I like Willy Wonka.  Let's hear a song, Tom.  He's my favorite.  Yeah.  Come with me, and you'll be in a world of your imagination. 
[01:20:00]  Take a look at a book, and you'll be in your imagination.  Your imagination.  Simply do it.  Will that change the world?  There's nothing to it.  Yeah.  That's it.  That's Willy Wonka. 
[01:20:30]  And the Chocolate Factory is his underwear.  He's doing this all with dignity as his fly is undone.  Oh, really?  Oh, we just got breaking news.  Cream Pie Jones will also take fingers up his ass.  Wow.  They're lining up today for their exams.  Where's Cream Pie Jones?  Yeah, he freaked out the other day.  He just said he's on a run.  When the porn star.  Oh, he's on a run?  The porn star wanted to give him a blowjob. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  Allegedly.  And he, well, he freaked out.  But he's okay with me doing my...  Yeah, apparently so.  That's a little odd, isn't it?  That's a little odd.  Hog out the whole studio, you motherfucker.  But Tom, our names are on the billboard.  I'm sorry.  He's talking about us.  Tom.  Well, anyway, thank you for the beer.  You're welcome. 
[01:21:30]  Tom.  Can you hear us?  Bring Tom in.  Bring him over there.  Oh, the crowd loves their cheer.  Well, they're cheering because then, you know, they can get some fresh air.  Ladies and gentlemen, Tippi Tom has made his way up to the studio.  No, over there.  Tom.  You got to sit over there.  It's way over there.  Over here.  Yeah, over there.  Holy shit.  Hey, Tom, were you in West Virginia working in the mines?  What the fuck, Tom?  He's not as bad as usual.  Okay. 
[01:22:00]  Tom, what have you been up to since the last time we saw you?  Well, what I've been doing is making millions of dollars.  Yeah.  And I forgot where I put it.  Yeah.  I buried my money.  Yeah.  And so I got to go looking for it.  Yeah.  And so I can come out with some more money.  Yeah.  So I buried cans and stuff like that and blah, blah, blah, blah, gold.  Yeah.  That only does.  And so what I got to do is I got to go find where I put it. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  Hey, are you still wearing the underpants we gave you the last time?  Excuse me?  I can't hear you, sir.  Are you still wearing the underpants that we gave you?  Oh, that you gave me here?  The last time we saw you, we cut your underpants off and there was like a shit brick in there.  You got another new?  That was last time.  Yeah.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  I got new ones.  Tom's dressing stylish.  I went to the Salvation Army and they gave me brand new pants because I wore them ones  out and they gave me.  He's looking very stylish. 
[01:23:00]  Who did you kill for those clothes?  You need a belt.  Tom, you need a belt, don't you?  Are you holding your pants up?  I'm holding them up right now.  What do you think?  Are they too big for you?  No.  What's the matter?  Those golden buns won't hold your pants up?  Golden buns get skinny.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Yeah, and you'll keep getting skinnier.  Why are you getting skinny there, Tom?  No more hiney.  And, um, they call me flat ass. 
[01:23:30]  And I don't recall that because I had the golden buns.  Yeah.  And that's why I wanted to be known as...  Hey, has the crowd seen Tippy Tom's ass yet?  You guys want to see golden buns?  Yeah, it looks like they said yes, man.  Jimmy, are they saying yes out there?  Yeah, they want to see.  Yeah, I think they...  Tom, go back outside there, Tom.  They're cheering for Tom.  They're cheering for Tom.  This crowd.  They're cheering for Tom. 
[01:24:00]  Wow.  No.  Wow.  That's crazy.  That's crazy.  And there's golden buns.  He's got a whip.  Yeah, he's stinking.  Oh, my God.  I just made him do it.  He's got a whip.  Yeah.  Because my golden buns are getting small.  Hey, Sam, talk to the crowd.  Anybody want...  Anyone have a comment about golden buns there?  What did you guys think of golden buns?  Horrible. 
[01:24:30]  What did you think of golden buns?  It was common for me.  He's got the skeleton already.  Who's the original golden buns?  Me.  I'm the original golden buns.  I'm gold bun granddaddy.  I am the best.  Holy crap, is that the worst smell?  There's all the fake golden buns out there.  Oh, God.  It's awful.  I'm the real golden buns.

Hey, where's cream pie Jones?  Can you shake them buns like me?  You can't shake.  Yeah.  Shake them buns.  Come on, shake with me. 
[01:25:30]  Where's the cream pie Jones?  We got to talk to him.  He might still be out right now.  Oh, all right.  Can you shake them buns?  Tom's sweatshirt has dollar stimulus.  Oh, my God.  He can't.  And a big portrait of Benjamin Franklin from the $100 bill.  That's a bad day for me.  We also have Brie Olsen stopping by, the porn star.  She was in once.  Yeah, where is she?  Is she here yet?  Not yet.  Not yet.  Okay.  I hate to bail, but I got a fucking plane.  Oh, boy. 
[01:26:00]  Sucks on a day like this.  Huh?  Please just got here?  Oh, wow.  Nice.  Yeah.  Nice big audience.  Tippy Tom Stench.  Boy, this sucks.  And I have to go down to the Bahamas  and drink banana rum drinks by a pool.  Yeah, that really sucks.  By a pool.  We get to stay with Tippy Tom  while you fucking hobnob with Nicolini in a bikini.  It sucks to be you.  Thank you.  I can't remember from you. 
[01:26:30]  I think I'm the best ass in school.  All right.  Well, I'll leave it in your capable hands, boys.  I'll be listening.  I'm sure it's going to be entertaining radio  with this crazy motherfucker out there  as he just keeps drinking.  You're the best ass.  No, I'm not saying you have a bad ass.  I'm just saying that you are not Golden Buns.  I am Golden Buns.  And I am the best.  Was anyone disputing his title is Golden Buns?  It's like there's people clamoring to be Golden Buns. 
[01:27:00]  No, no, sir.  I'm Golden Buns.  No one's arguing.  Oh, no.  Another Golden Bun?  No one's arguing.  The Golden Bun Party?  Wait a minute.  The Golden Bun Party?  No.  He thinks everyone's here for him.  I know.  He thinks.  I'll let him.  All right.  Hey, Tom, everyone's showing up for you today, buddy.  Everyone's here for you.  Everyone's here for you.  Go Golden Buns.  Go Golden Buns. 
[01:27:30]  Go Golden Buns.  Go Golden Buns.  Go Golden Buns.  Go to the game.  All right, gentlemen.  And I'll be in touch.  All right, buddy.  Have a safe trip.  All right.  Have a safe flight.  Go to the Bahamas.  Hold this, please.  Up again.  Bring it up.  Yeah.  Stronger shirt.  All right.  All right.  I want to dance.  You want to dance, Tom?  Stand back. 
[01:28:00]  You and get the tippy-tom step.  All right.  Come on.  Get the music going.  What song you want, Tom?  It goes like this.  We're going to go to...  What is he doing?  I don't know.  The shit shuffle.  He's, uh...  It's the tippy-tom step.  No, I didn't dance.  Two.  Yeah.  Arrest that man.  Tom, what happened?  What do you want arrested?  Arrest him.  Why do you want him arrested?  Arrest him right now. 
[01:28:30]  Put the cuffs on him.  Come on.  Why?  Get on the hand and cuff him.  Why?  Why do you want to arrest Sam?  Well, because he insulted me.  What?  What did he say?  It hurt my feelings, man.  What did I do?  What did he say?  You said my golden buns weren't golden.  There's three of them.  There's a third.  I'm in third place.  Yeah.  I did not know that.  You're in third place.  Now I know.  All right.  Get back out there.  Hang with the listeners.  They're here for you, Tom.  Tom is charming today.  He's a whimsical, charming man when he's only been drinking for four hours. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  He's still relatively sober.  Jackass.  Jackass.  Jackass.  Jackass.  Yes.  Yes.  God damn it.  Wait.  What happened, Tom?  Tom keeps opening the door and screaming.  Isn't that the fact that Sam's supposed to do his story?  What?  He's telling Sam to get a haircut.  You tell officer that he got a fat haircut?  Yeah.  He looks like a freak.  Sam, he doesn't like your hair. 
[01:29:30]  No, it's Keith's hair.  He doesn't like Keith's hair.  Timmy Tom, that ain't for real.  You don't like Sam's hair?  If you can't catch me, guy, I run faster than you.  Oh, that's a threat there, Keith.  He doesn't think you could, you know, catch him.  My name is Timmy Tom.  Back to Timmy.  Hold on a second.  What I'm saying is I'm having a good time.  How did he find a bike, Sam?  He don't work for the show.  What I'm saying is that I'm having a good time, and you tell Keith that I will not deal with him with his bad behavior. 
[01:30:00]  Okay?  That's right.  Keith, it's Keith's job to find Timmy Tom.  He was a juvenile delinquent.  Yeah.  And now he's grown up a little bit, but he's still, he was a bad boy, and he's a good guy now, though.  But still.  Hey, Tom.  He's overweight.  He's got to lose 10 pounds.  You're saying Keith's overweight.  10 pounds.  He just told Steve he also needed to lose 10 pounds.  Yeah, that's generous.  Yeah, that's generous.  What, that, Opie? 
[01:30:30]  Yeah.  What are you doing over there, Opie?  I'm trying to, like, fucking control the festivities here today.  Just sitting around?  This is what I want you to do.  We want to give you the best seat in the house.  Sam, give him the middle of the bleachers, please.  Yes, the middle of the bleachers for Tippi Tom.  Make way for Tippi Tom.  Move over.  Tippi Tom's going to sit down and enjoy the show.  Up top there, Sam, on the second, maybe third row for Tippi Tom.  Right there. 
[01:31:00]  Right in the dead middle.  You're running the show, Tippi.  There you go.  Sit down.  All right.  They're not happy.  He's hogging up the speed.  How does he smell?  Terrible.  It's the worst.  Of the Opie and Anthony show.  All right, uh...  All right, Tippi Tom, I want to talk.  All right, Tippi, yeah.  I'm going to sit down now.  Tippi.  My days are on the dance.  Why are the doctors putting on all sorts of fucking biohazard gear?  I know.  Do you have a question for me, please?  Hold on, yeah. 
[01:31:30]  When was the last time you saw a doctor, Tippi Tom?  About a thousand years ago.  When I was growing up.  Yeah.  And then, um...  Yeah, but that was about it.  Yeah.  I'm going to go to doctors who don't like them.  Oh.  Because they'll find out things that are wrong with you that aren't.  Tom, I've got to ask you something.  So I'm really not happy with doctors.  Have you been drooling for oil?  How much oil do I drink?  No, have you been drooling for oil?  You have fucking hands on Daniel Day-Lewis.  Oh, I do that all the time. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah.  So, um, what else do you want to hear?  Tippi Tom, the doctor's going to examine you now, so you have to take your clothes off.  Yeah.  Oh, to see my body?  Yeah, you've got to take your clothes off.  So, again, take your clothes off.  Well...  Step out in front of the crowd.  That's going to cost them some money.  Well, is that right over here?  That's going to cost...  No, they said no.  No, no, they didn't mean no.  Go ahead.  Want some money?  Come on.  Well, yeah.  No, I'm on our radio.  Right here. 
[01:32:30]  This is the...  Oh, I'm on your clothes.  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the charity portion of the Opie Anthony show where we pass  around a basket like we're in church.  What do I do?  Give.  Give to the homeless.  Give me clothes off.  Yeah, be sexy.  Take your clothes off and throw them like a stripper.  No, wait a second.  All right, take your clothes off, Tom, for your...  Tom, for your exam, take your clothes off.  Throw your money, ladies and gentlemen. 
[01:33:00]  Throw your money.  I'm not taking all my clothes off.  You've got to take it off for your exam.  Yeah.  It's your pants.  Well, where's the doctor at?  Right there.  That's the doctor.  All right, all right.  Come on, come on.  You just...  All right.  You do this.  What are we doing?  We're standing here.  Dr. Steve's keeping it here.  Come on.  Dr. Steve's keeping it very professional.  He said, Tom doesn't have to take all the time off.  Get your hog away from me.  How is his penis next day?  Jimmy was...  Don't sprinkle them by me, E-Rock. 
[01:33:30]  Jimmy was three feet from Jimmy's penis.  All right, get over here.  Tom, we're going to...  Yeah, I'm getting over here.  Tom, we're going to examine you.  Dr. Steve is a real doctor.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Tom and I talked before the show.  Yeah.  All right.  And he's cool with doing this on the air.  Am I sitting down or standing up?  We'll let you stand up.  You've got to take your jacket off that time, right?  Take Anthony's chair.  I'm going to tell him I'm standing up right now.  All right.  Because I'm going to get an exam.  Yes.  To see if I'm okay.  He hasn't been to the doctor in a long time, and we've arranged for someone at the Ryan Center 
[01:34:00]  uptown to see him after the show if we find anything.  Okay.  Yeah, because, you know, my pancreas is giving out.  Not your liver?  Let's see.  Something else is breaking down.  And plus, I stubbed my toe.  And that's what bothers me the most.  So, can you fix the toe?  Sure.  Absolutely.  Let's see your feet, Tom.  Yeah, let's see your feet.  By the way, who's working the pal talk cameras? 
[01:34:30]  No, I'm going to stick the place up.  No one's working the pal talk cameras.  I got my new socks on.  Yeah.  Yeah, Dad.  You know how to do that?  And I have to keep them on.  That's right where Tommy is.  We have a couple cameras out today.  My doctor told me.  Because I stubbed my toe.  All right.  Dr. Steve is listening to his heart.  Steve, you've got to give us commentary, honestly.  I'm just listening to his heart.  And it actually sounds pretty darn good.  You can take this working, huh?  Yep.  Oh, that's good. 
[01:35:00]  That's good.  Take a deep breath for me.  Take a deep breath.  Oh, boy.  Emphysema for everyone.  Casually.  Well, I mostly smoke other things.  I'm just going to feel it.  I smoke corn silk.  Corn silk.  How is his lungs?  Where did he get that in the city?  How is his lungs?  He's got it in a cornfield in Jersey.  Where do you think you're going to get it at?  All right.  They got it in Long Island, too. 
[01:35:30]  Steve?  Okay.  Now, Tom, you know your liver's a little enlarged.  I think my liver is a little enlarged.  Oh, that's not enough.  Can I see your ankle?  What you're feeling, Steve, is the help me sign.  The liver's holding up.  Oh, the ankle, no good.  The ankle, no good.  Yeah, this is where it gets serious.  Well, this one's not too bad.  Oh, Tom.  No, this one's worse. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah, Dr. Steve is looking at Tippi Tom's ankles.  But it's not too bad.  I can still walk.  Yeah.  So, obviously, everything's...  Have they been swollen like that for a long time?  Dr. Steve, you're not happy.  Well, they go up and down, you know.  Yeah.  You know, some days up, some days down.  Dr. Steve, it's been about a year that I've seen it like that.  Yeah.  Well...  Do you get shorter breath when you lay down?  No.  Okay.  All right.  What do you think that means, this ankle?  When you have big ankles, it can be from a lot of things, but it's always fluid, and 
[01:36:30]  it's just the question is where...  Uh-huh.  Edema.  Yeah.  Edema, I mean?  Yeah.  Where is the fluid coming from now?  Well, I didn't allow it to be.  There you go.  What this really looks like is a thing called venous stasis, which is just...  It's from gravity pulling on the veins in the legs.  Yeah, gravity!  I did not know that!  And fluid...  Now I know.  Fluid leaks out from the veins.  And we'll talk about that after the show. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, but if you elevate your legs when you're laying down, that'll actually help that.  That is true.  Yes.  Elevate them.  That's what I do!  Yep.  Oh, good.  Yeah, but I lay on concrete.  It helps my back, too, because I got a bad back.  Okay.  So I lay on a flat surface and elevate my dukes, my feet, and that way the blood circulation  runs right, because when I wake up, if I go to sleep, if I'm lucky, then I wake up 
[01:37:30]  or get up when I'm done laying down, so I can walk.  You spend most of the day on your feet?  Because I like to walk around town!  Yeah!  Now, the thing that I'd like to do next is what we talked about earlier, is to check  your prostate and check your rear end.  My prostate, Lynn?  Yep.  Well, that might be a job.  You want to go up my ass?  Yep.  What we'll do is we'll have you drop your drawers, and I'll have you bend over the table, and 
[01:38:00]  we'll bring up a...  Right here?  Yep.  We'll bring up a sheet so that nobody can see you.  So something?  A camera?  No, and I'll just use my finger, and we'll just test you for blood, and we'll check out  your prostate gland.  Check the...  So you can put the finger up the ass, huh?  Yeah.  Is that okay?  Yeah.  Will you rotate it a little bit?  I want to enjoy this, boxer!  And enjoy it for free! 
[01:38:30]  See, I just let the material be funny.  I don't have to try to be funny.  That's fucking great.  Will you rotate it?  If you can put a finger up my ass, I want it to feel good, and that's the way it is.  All right, let's get this sheet off for...  If it don't feel good, I'll be mad.  You okay with doing this?  Well, when are we going to do this job?  Right now.  Where?  Right here?  Yep.  In front of everybody? 
[01:39:00]  Yep.  They'll bring the sheet up.  Right here?  The sheet's up.  No one can see you except us.  The figure's going in your ass?  If it's okay with you.  In front of everybody?  There's only a matter of time.  Yeah, just...  Wow!  You'll just make it in front of everybody.  Yeah.  Tommy, bend forward, and he checks you.  Yeah, that's all.  It's just quickie.  Yeah, but suppose they like my ass.  I'm golden buns, and they may like me.  That's why we got to check out.  The golden buns don't want to...  I have too many people on me.  We're checking out...  And I can only handle a few at a time. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  We're checking out golden buns for you.  It'll just be me.  Yeah.  And this is my partner, PA John, who you've met before.  Oh, another doctor.  Yes, sir.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Good!  I got two doctors.  That's right.  And I'm happy.  You ready?  All right, Tom.  How are we going to do this?  You just drop your drawers and bend over the table.  Just kind of touch your ankle.  Just kind of bend over.  You going to do this?  Yep.  Yep.  Yeah.  All right.  Everybody, I'm going to get checked out.  Let me see what happens here.  By the way, I got to remind people, Dr. Steve got him a real checkup for later on today. 
[01:40:00]  Dr. Steve is behind.  Come on, get this asshole out.  Tom, do you want to tell us what's going on?  Ow!  It hurts.  You haven't even started yet.  Yeah, come on, Tom.  All right.  Let's listen to Tom.  I'm up here now.  Come on, man.  Get ready.  Oh.  All right.  Here we go.  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow! 
[01:40:30]  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Your prostate is a normal size.  Oh, that's good news.  I didn't feel anything abnormal on it at all, and we're checking you for blood right now.  Oh, you got to pull some blood out of me, man.  No, no, no.  We're checking what we got out of your rear end for blood.  Oh, you get it in there?  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  No, no, no. 
[01:41:00]  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  It's a miracle!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Miracles do happen!  I love that.  What do you have to say, Tippy Tom?  Yeah!  What do you think, Tippy Tom?  Well, I'll say I'm very happy that my doctors are here.  Yeah.  And I'm very happy that I got a clear, clean bill of health.  Yeah.  And that's it.  And so what I got to say is that, thank you for the medical. 
[01:41:30]  How much is the bill?  There you go.  Okay, I'll pay the bill.  Dr. Steve handing over money.  It's very unusual for a doctor.  I'm going to go blow my horn.  All right.  How did it feel?  The finger up there.  It felt great, man.  Yeah.  Well, you know these things.  Sure.  Yeah.  Can this be the end of my bed?  Can this be the end of my bed?  Can this be the end of my bed?  Yeah, I don't think we kids like it better than we did today, so.  This is normal, my hand.  All right.  I'm not a doctor.  All right. 
[01:42:00]  Go get a beer, Tom.  Thanks, Tom.  Anyway, I think I better get out of here.  We still got you an appointment at the Ryan Center today.  If you, uh.  What time?  Around one o'clock it'd be fine.  Well, you know where I'll be.  I've given Kiki a dress.  You still got to get those legs looked at.  Well, the blood test?  No, we just get, well, you'd need some blood tests.  What time?  Somewhere around one o'clock it'd be fine.  Well, you know where I'll be.  And we'll get, I've given Kiki a dress.  You still got to get those legs looked at.  Well, the blood test?  No, we just get, well, you'd need some blood tests. 
[01:42:30]  Well, I ain't got nothing wrong with my blood.  Fair enough.  Oh, huh?  Then my asshole's fine now  So everything's alright, right?  We gotta get your  Everything that we've checked is up  Yes, yeah  Except for your ankles  Yes  And that needs to be dealt with  You have Hillary Clinton-itis  My ankles don't pull  Alright, Tom  There's a problem with my ankles  Tom, go get a beer, buddy  Don't forget your money  Well, I need a beer  Anybody got any beer around here? 
[01:43:00]  And you got money, Tom  Anybody else want to throw money  You gotta make a trail of it out the door  Dr. C, what's up with the legs?  He's just got a lot of fluid in there  And when the skin stretches out like that  The blood can't get to the capillaries  And it causes a thing called stasis dermatitis  Which is just a thickening of the skin  And, you know, it can crack and break  And it can get infected 
[01:43:30]  And it can cause some problems  So he needs to get looked at  He needs some elastic stockings  How does he cure that?  Getting off his feet  Part of his problem is  He's probably on his feet  16 hours a day  Right  Can he lose his legs?  Because that's what we worry about  If he got an infection there, yeah  Oh, wow  Yeah, it's a possibility  Alright  He's got  Poor circulation to him  Poor circulation, that's what it is  I'm going home 
[01:44:00]  Back to the place where I belong  And where your love has always been enough for me  I'm not running from  No, I think you got me all wrong  I don't know  I don't know  Regret  This life I choose for me  But these places and these faces are getting old 
[01:44:30]  So I'm going home  Well, I'm going home  Opie and Anthony  It's a madhouse  We gotta calm down, man  I gotta tell you right now  The worst  I am the worst  The worst of Opie and Anthony  The worst of Opie and Anthony  It is the worst  The fucking worst of Opie and Anthony 
[01:45:00]  That's the worst idea I've ever heard in my life  I teased this tape yesterday  Because the Jerry Lewis telethon was on yesterday  And I reminded the boys that back in the day  When I used to be a really nice person  I actually volunteered my time  Yes  And I did some local TV for the Jerry Lewis telethon  Oh, you certainly did  I also was part of the Big Brother program in Rochester  You were so involved with nice guy stuff  I was dripping with niceness  Yes 
[01:45:30]  And I realized probably a little too late  That nice stinks  Nice doesn't get you anywhere  And I changed my tune  To the wonderful person you hear every morning  Let's just watch this fabulous tape  So, well, hold on  So then I went searching for the tape  And boy, it's better than we thought yesterday  Not only did I find the Jerry Lewis telethon stuff  I found a demo tape  That I thought I was going to be sending 
[01:46:00]  Probably to MTV  Probably to all the big TV outlets across America  And they're going to go  I'm going to make him a star  That's right  Greg Hughes, the nice guy  Was going to be discovered  And he was going to become a big TV star  Years later, I'm doing what I should be doing  Radio  As a dick  That's what we should all be doing  It's great  Is it?  Yeah  Is it?  Sure  Radio's good, man  You don't have to  The TV, they become obsessed with looks and all that 
[01:46:30]  The radio's great  You just do five hours a day  Yeah, rolling, who cares  Who's doing five, three to five hours a day  But I was going to parlay my early radio jobs into a big TV gig  That's the point I'm making here  But I said goodbye to the nice guy  And that's that  These guys don't have any clue of the nice version  That's what I love  Hope he's trying his best to preface what you're going to see  I heard the charming part  But he goes, hi, I'm Hopey 
[01:47:00]  Have a charming part  All right, well  Hi  Wait till you see it  This is  The visual is fantastic  I guess this is a little compilation of what Opie did over  How long of a period of time is this?  I don't know  Maybe  I don't know  Probably a year to maybe two years of stuff  A year to maybe two years of TV stuff  And if you're in TV or radio  You compile your work  You put it on a tape  And that way you can send it out 
[01:47:30]  Like Opie said  So this is what amounts to a compilation  And he kind of intros it as that  And this is also what I thought was  The best of the best  The best of the best  I'd love to see what you threw out  What didn't make the tape?  Probably nothing  All right, here we go  Here it is, Jimmy  Oh, jeez  Get ready  Hi, I'm Opie  A starving radio personality  I need TV work

[01:55:00]  It's like  It's just done  Obviously in a studio  It's a terrible backdrop  The girl's horrible  With a really, really bad  Kind of like  Was that a mullet she had?  It was just  She had no hint of a body  No  Terrible  That one I think  I was still in college  I look like a 12  You got the acid wash jeans  Acid wash jeans  Pulled up a little too high  And the acting between them  Is just awful  It's supposed to be casual  Like kind of  We caught them on film  Interacting and having fun  Having fun with their t-shirts  And their Cokes, man  Just dressed alike  Like an old lesbian couple 
[01:55:30]  And there's a funny  The opening moment is great  I wish people could see this  On the radio  Because Opie and the girl  Walk by each other  And there's no take too  Apparently on this one  You can see they kind of  Bump into each other  Walking by  It's still  We don't have to replay it  It's so bad  This is radio  We don't have to replay it  Watch when they walk by each other  How they kind of  Bump shoulders or whatever  Instead of just redoing it  They just  I thought it was good  No one would notice that  Well, people would bump  Into each other  Right  Oh, it's so bad  It's the worst color of red ever 
[01:56:00]  It just says enjoy Coke  A huge red enjoy Coke t-shirt  What are you talking about?

[01:56:30]  You will  She's walking backwards  And he's walking forwards  They're walking through the frame  To each other  But he has to move his shoulder  Out of the way  Because that stupid mullet woman  Didn't know  How to knock back up into you  Mullet woman  She was terrible  This was such a successful campaign  Yeah  Or I think Coke had more money to spend  That we did a follow up to that commercial  That I cannot find  Wow  Thank God  It's a series? 
[01:57:00]  Well  You like the Sanka commercials  Yeah  These two are the next big thing  In Rochester Coke t-shirt sales  We did a feeling hot, hot, hot beach party  Oh  Please find it  Yeah, please  My girl begged me not to bring this in  What did she  What part  Which one so far  What have we seen  Oh, right  Which one did she really  Right from the get-go  She was hiding her face  And then kind of like  You know  Peeking  Like she was trying to look at the 
[01:57:30]  Scary movie  At a movie theater  Ah  What'd she think  When she knew the killer wasn't  Going to do anything  Then she would take a peek  That's kind of what she was doing  And then she immediately called Anthony  And begged Anthony  He goes  Please  I don't tell him what to do  But this is  This is not good  Like  Sorry  Can't help you  Did she not like that commercial  With like  Oh  Jesus  Had to be  She's doing so many faces  And expressions  Guys  Be happy together  Yeah, yeah  Talking to her  What could you have been saying to her  I don't

Here you go.  I'm going home.  Yeah, she is.  Hey, Rick, why don't you call Deb from CBS and see how that went?  See how Deb from CBS liked that.  And if Deb feels like it, she could come on our show after we take a quick break, right?  I think that went well.  I thought it was good.  Hell yeah. 
[02:22:30]  I think it was positive all around.  Very positive.  I think it was good for the show.  It was good for Cheryl.  I hope her kids were listening.  God, I can't breathe.  I haven't left Ed Lard.  I have to tell you right now in years.  Years.  I couldn't breathe.  It's going to hurt when he was that laugh that Opie did.  Oh, man.  He's like, he took the sledgehammer out.  I was wondering how somebody was going to react to a hysterical condom water balloon story.  Right back to third grade.  And then right in the Richard Jenny wheelhouse? 
[02:23:00]  Right in the Richard Jenny wheelhouse.  Man, is that solid.  You killed me.  That's solid.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Stay there.  It's old school.  Old school.  It's old school.  We hate to promote another news station, but you've got to watch NBC News tonight.  Yeah.  For the simple reason, Tom Brokaw has to say Achille Lauro.  Achille Lauro.  Yeah. 
[02:23:30]  Achille Lauro.  Back in the news.  Seems a couple of women are suing Yasa Arafat for like five million bucks.  Because of the 85 hijacking of the cruise ship, Achille Lauro.  I don't know why.  Roll tape tonight.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  A follow-up 15 years ago, the hijacking of the cruise ship. 
[02:24:00]  Boy, I never thought I'd have to say this again.  Achille Lauro.  Achille Lauro.  Achille Lauro.  Filing a lawsuit to American women seeking damage against Palestinian leader Yasa Agarra.  Oh, screw this story.  Why do I have to say Achille Lauro?  Hey, Tom, I was just reading about you the other day.  Yeah, yeah.  You had a little problem at a hotel recently.  At a hotel?  Yeah.  I was sitting at the St. Regis and the butler wouldn't iron my heavy metal heater. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, that's not what happened.  Could that be what it is?  I heard you had a problem getting the key to work or something?  Yes.  In the room?  Yes.  Yes, it turns out there was a story.  I got back from an interview at 2.30 in the morning to my hotel room.  Two?  Two.  Ponder it.  Was that Don on the phone?  Where are those pictures I was supposed to see?  2.30 and my hotel key would not work. 
[02:25:00]  I was trying to stick it in the door and it wouldn't work and I was a bit woozy.  Why were you so woozy?  Well, I was up banging Katie Couric all night long.  That chick sure goes.  She was waiting spread eagle on Tom Brokaw's bed and I couldn't even get the key in the door,  never mind my junk, into Katie Couric.  You know, did you see the Katie Couric anal exam that she did?  Unfortunately, I did, yes.  Where Katie took the pipe? 
[02:25:30]  Yeah, they had the camera up her balloon.  Well, Tom Brokaw gave her her own anal exam with his meat pipe.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News with Katie Couric on location.  Now I have to say a heliolaro again tonight.  Boogaloo galoo, boogaloo galoo, I'm over here now.  Yes, I couldn't get into my room.  I was very upset.  I wanted to wash up. 
[02:26:00]  My junk smelled like Katie Couric's...  Oh, come on.  Like Katie Couric's bung.  It happens.  She loves anal.  Ever since she got the pipe on national television,  you see her there laying on her side as the pipe was thrust inside her looking at some cancerous polyps.  Polyps.  I get it.  Ever since then, she's like, Tom, Tom, I can't get enough pipe in my anal. 
[02:26:30]  Rod.  Yeah.  What's up?  What's up?  I hear they're serving a new drink on the Achilles lauro.  It's the Leon Klinghoffer.  It's two shots and a splash.  Yes, Leon Klinghoffer.  Thumped off of the deck of the Achilles lauro.  Much like my junk fell into Katie Couric's large bum.  Exclusive audio of me and Katie Couric. 
[02:27:00]  She loves it.  She loves anal.  And look, listen to this.  Listen to how big Tom is.  Yes.  Take it, you bitch.  Take it, Katie.  Tom.  Tom broke out.  Yeah, so I couldn't get my hotel room key into the door.  I hear you can make a comparison between Peter Jennings' junk and your junk over there. 
[02:27:30]  Yes, my junk is huge.  And Peter Jennings?  Peter Jennings is hung like an acorn.  It's very small.  Don't you have the audio of the two?  Yes, okay.  I get where you're going with this one, Opie.  All right.  Okay, here is Peter Jennings' junk.  And now Tom broke off, pulls down his pants. 
[02:28:00]  Katie Couric accepting my junk.  Come here, Katie.  You love it, don't you?  Hey, where's my zipper?  Oh, there it is.  I couldn't find it on the new template.  Listen to her scream and pleasure tonight on NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw as I in-depthly  probe Katie Couric. 
[02:28:30]  All right.  Key in the door, junk in the whore.  Hey, this is Duff McKagan, and you're listening to Stephen Carr, lead singer of Foundry.  Don't think you're listening to the oil podcast.  Let's get tosee, Stan.  Listen to me, Tom Brokaw.  This Экспertation is now on the new website.  We'll be right back when you look patient.  Little bit boy. 
[02:29:00]  Little bit boy.  Little bit boy.  Little bit boy.  Little bit boy.  Little bit boy.  Little bit boy.  I want to live, I want to dream, I want to fly, I want to die 
[02:29:30]  And the thoughts of my existence is yours to compromise  I want to live, I want to hate, I want to turn and deviate  From a stage of the prison and my mind of detention  What was human has been shattered  No theory of fighting magic  All that's left of me is scattered  Now you're going to the pain of the flu 
[02:30:00]  He's the only one that is to kill you  The only sanity until you turn blue  He's the only one that is to kill you  Drive to hide through pain  I feel a thought and now I feel too real  And cannot be concealed  So you will hear a tear  And I destroy what you will hear  Often you might just see what kills me  My heart's getting heavy, my blood's getting cold  It takes me into something that I just can't control 
[02:30:30]  If she could cut off and let's get out of my way  Who cares your love is swinging back the other way  And you're going to the point, my hand  But I wonder what kills me  And I fear that I feel will take this  Because the adult is nothing  So you are going to the other way  And I wonder how well  I am going to the other fight  And how cool can come to death  And how do you lead me to death  And howcool can I forgive you  And howap is Holiday  Thank you. 
[02:31:00]  I just can't control. 
[02:31:30]  You see me coming, let's get out of my way.  The pendulum is swinging back the other way.  My heart's getting heavy, my blood's getting cold.  You change me into something that I just can't control.  If you see me coming, let's get out of my way.  The pendulum is swinging back the other way.  You were taking it all and you still wanted more.  You never knew I'd hit you till they found you on the floor. 
[02:32:00]  And when my hands were taking down, you had your back turned.  Don't you make it start in that fire that you're gonna kill?  I'm getting heavy, my blood's getting cold.  You change me into something that I just can't control.  If you see me coming, let's get out of my way.  The pendulum is swinging back the other way.  I try to hide the pain I feel inside.  And now I feel too real and cannot be concealed.  So you will hear a cheering I destroy what you won't hear. 
[02:32:30]  Then you might just see what you'll think.  Yeah, this is Duff McKagan from Belt Revolver.  And you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's degrading.  That is just horrific.  It's a freak show.  Just let this show die, then.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:33:00]  They should be shot.  Jim Norton has arrived.  What's up, Jimmy?  What's up, man?  Say hi to the Fox crew from Fox News.  Hi, they're filming me.  Nice.  They're annoying as hell.  Nice.  You're not being very nice, Opie.  Well, we should get the lady in.  Melee.  Melee.  Let's talk to her.  We're doing catfighting today.  She called us up last week.  Said she has girls that catfight. 
[02:33:30]  They rip each other's clothes off and just get into big brawls.  We ready to rumble a lot.  Wow.  What kind of drugs are you on?  Nothing.  Really?  It's me.  She gives really good hugs, Anthony.  Very nice hugs.  How do you?  Oh, that's okay.  I prefer.  I'm like a germaphobe, I guess.  I prefer not to be.  Well, that's my excuse for not being touched.  I just don't like being touched.  You don't like being touched?  No, no.  I'm a very cold person.  I'll touch it with my eyes. 
[02:34:00]  No, no.  Well, see, that's why I thought you were on drugs.  You guys.  No.  Your eyes are like, whoa.  No, I'm on the phone.  I like being touched.  Pupil dilation.  Pupil dilation.  Pupil dilation.  What does it do?  Okay, terrific.  Melee.  Melee.  So, we're here.  We're ready for some action.  You have girls.  I was anticipating all this all day.  You have girls.  That's that fight.  Yes.  We got girls.  You got a little magazine there?  I got some magazines.  All right.  Let me take a look.  Me on the cover.  Oh, that's you on the cover. 
[02:34:30]  Can I have a magazine?  You will have a magazine.  Oh, my God.  I bought some videos.  I have some CDs.  And I have some gifts for the girls.  Cat spats.  Special issue.  Cocky cat fighters.  Woo.  How about that?  Go get them.  So, you're in charge of the cat fighting in New York City?  Well, not per se.  I mean, I work for a company.  They're Crystal Films.  And if you want more information, you can find them at catfight1.com.  You can get some information there. 
[02:35:00]  Could you take it down a notch?  Take it down a notch.  Who's the chick with the braces?  Oh, my God.  She got her teeth straightened out before they took them off.  No, really.  No melee.  Yes.  What are the rules of cat fighting?  We thought the rules were really simple.  The girl that gets her clothes ripped off first loses.  Not necessarily.  The way we've been doing them for the last maybe seven years is by points.  We have judges.  Ah, the point system. 
[02:35:30]  Is there any hardcore sex in these videos?  Or is it just chicks punching each other?  No, pretty much girls going at each other.  I saw the video back in the office.  You would like it.  A lot of hair pulling.  We saw the opening.  It was a lot of lead up.  The only two things that we do not allow is fist punching in the face and eye gouging.  That's best left at home anyway.  Yes.  All right.  Well, we'll see what happens.  We've got a lot of girls coming down for this, Ant.  Don't worry.  Well, I mean, it's up for grabs.  I know our listeners will.  Up for grabs.  By who?  Oh, up for grabs. 
[02:36:00]  I know our listeners won't let us down.  Okay.  Your girls might let us down.  We've got some wild girls associated with the show.  We've got teenagers that are going to do teen catfighting today.  Okay.  How old are they?  Like 13, 14.  Nice.  Young.  I want to see.  I want to face.  No, not 13, 14.  They're 18.  Oh, okay.  Legal.  Still considered teens.  You know, the barely legal variety.  Okay.  Well, that's acceptable.  All right.  I want them to get like their necks and leg locks and leave hickeys. 
[02:36:30]  Are we allowed to jump in and throw a punch or two if we want?  No, sir.  No punching.  There's no punching allowed.  No punching and no eye gouging.  Aren't you listening to it?  How about an open-handed slap maybe or a good nipple grab and spit around the room?  The audience is not allowed to participate.  Hey, can I jump in?  Because I used to punch Robin Gibbons right in the face and it was wonderful.  I thought it was the best punch I ever threw on my whole effing wife.  And I punched Robin Gibbons.  She flew across the room and hit the wall.  It was wonderful.  More power to him.  And then I bit her ear off. 
[02:37:00]  No guy on girl stuff.  You've never done that.  The girls that I'm bringing down, they do fight guys.  Oh, they do?  Yeah, so if you want to talk to them when they show up, you can make an arrangement or appointment  with them and they'll be more than happy.  I thought of something during the commercial break.  I thought of something during the commercial break.  It's a talent Opie has that is amazing.  He's 100% on this.  He could tell people's age. 
[02:37:30]  You know, Ann, I don't think it was.  No, no, no, no.  Don't even back down on this.  He could tell people's age from the taint.  You know what the taint is?  I don't think I want to show off my skills today, Ann.  Melee, Fox News is here.  No, because I got to see this.  This is amazing.  We've done this before.  He never fails.  You know what the taint is, Melee?  Where?  It taint the front of you and it taint the back of you.  It's taint.  You know what I mean?  Right in the middle, in between.  I mean, it's right there in the magazine. 
[02:38:00]  It's the part most covered with the gray hairs.  The taint.  The taint.  Right where the stripe is.  And I know, because this is a great test.  Would you show Opie your taint and he can guess your age?  It's a miracle.  You will be amazed.  It's like watching Kreskin work.  I'm a little tired today.  I don't really want to show off my skills.  You're not backing out of this one.  And if you want privacy, just show Opie.  But he will guess your age from just looking at your taint. 
[02:38:30]  I am really good at this.  Show him.  Opie, please.  Humor me a minute.  Would you just go over there and show Opie your taint?  We do have a lot of new cities listening to the show, too.  You'll be amazed.  Would you please just show Opie your taint?  Can I take a rain check?  Um, no.  Could you just?  It's easy.  You go over to that side of the console.  I'll do it first.  You're wearing a dress.  Colin, show Opie your taint.  No, no, no.  Is this going to be on the O'Reilly Factor?  I swear to God, we thought Norton was like 24 until he got drunk in the office. 
[02:39:00]  Opie like blurted it out when you had that episode.  Easy.  No, could you please just?  I will guess your age.  Take off the headphones.  Yeah.  Take off the headphones.  Walk over to that side and watch.  You'll be amazed.  I'll guess it within a year.  Without a doubt.  Within a year?  No.  I've never failed.  He's never failed to hit it on the mark.  Yeah, but if she just had a birthday or.  Don't say anything.  You know what I mean?  Just, could you take your headphones off and walk over there?  You'll be stunned.  He's not going to look at the other areas.  No.  Just right in the middle of the taint.  Just in the middle.  Right.  Thank you, Colin. 
[02:39:30]  If you don't want this film, you just tell the crew and they will not film it.  No filming.  They wouldn't show this, but they're not going to show this on Fox.  No filming.  Yeah, Fox News is going to show this.  Fox 5 coming up.  Taint.  We'll show you a 10.  Taint.  By the way, Anthony, payback is a bitch.  Yeah.  Oh, here she goes.  Now, go around that way.  Oh, that's okay.  I understand.  She's got to take off some stuff.  Slop it on the wall.  Come on.  She's a bro.  Yeah.  Well, well.  And I'm going to kill you.  No, because I'm stunned at this.  This is outrageous. 
[02:40:00]  This is a great idea when you're wrong.  All right.  Show the taint.  Show the taint to Opie.  No, no, no.  You've got to go around that way.  Ride.  No, you can back out.  No, who knows where the taint is here?  Lift up.  He's kind of a strange...  You're going to learn really quick.  No, wait.  I can't do this.  Opie, do it for crying out loud.  I'm not feeling my talent today.  No.  No, I'm really not feeling it.  Use the force loop.  No, no.  You're going to read it.  He's sexy.  Come on.  I am not feeling this today.  Stare into Medusa.  My psychic powers are undone.  Let her do it. 
[02:40:30]  Opie, don't ruin it.  All right.  Back up a little, though.  She's sexy.  Take a look.  He's like Karnak.  All right.  All right.  Now, watch this.  Now, you've got to lift up.  Now, lift up.  Take a look at the taint, Opie.  No, lift up a...  Just a little more.  There it is.  See?  You see it?  Taking a look.  Did you get it?  Wait, no, no.  Did you get it?  No, I had to look away.  Don't look away.  What are you...  It looks like...  I stared into the face of Medusa.  All right.  Listen.  Take a good look and guess the age. 
[02:41:00]  I'm looking like an idiot because this is an amazing thing and you're not...  All right.  Take a good look.  Stare into the abyss.  There he goes.  You have to...  You have to...  It looks like a documentary.  How's that for a topper?  You have to...  Oh, you've got to show him a little more real estate with...  There you go.  There she goes.  Opie.  Wow.  Look at that.  Now, watch this.  I'm stunned whenever he does this.  Opie, please.  Guess the age.  Will you shut up?  I'm working it out in my head right now. 
[02:41:30]  All right.  Looks like a documentary on Sarajevo.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  If you could just a little...  Yeah, right there.  All right.  He's taking a look.  Okay.  One, two, three.  Now, do you do some kind of math?  Let's see.  I don't know what it is.  Okay.  It's an aspicus.  Alchemy.  Alchemy.  Like, I've turned it into gold.  I'm almost there.  So, I need the number five sub in here.  Is there a turtle head poking out?  Okay.  I got it.  Yes.  All right. 
[02:42:00]  I hate you.  Now, we'll get you back.  Buckle in.  You're going to love this.  Here, sit over there, because if I'm wrong, I don't want you to punch me.  Yeah, because...  Well, I've never seen you.  I've never seen you come up wrong on this.  I must say...  And I get stunned.  A bit deceiving.  Why?  I don't know.  I was going to go a little older.  Were you?  Yeah.  Now, judging by her taint alone, you will tell us her age.  Well, she just showed us over 40.  Yeah.  She should not be in that magazine, Anthony.  Whoa. 
[02:42:30]  You're saying she's younger than 40?  No.  She's...  Oh, really?  She should be in over 50.  Am I right so far?  How old?  Watch this.  I just had a birthday, so...  Uh-oh.  See that?  Okay, then I'm going to change my guess.  Why?  Because if she didn't have a birthday, then I would...  I'm going to go 52 years old.  How old are you?  52.  Holy Jesus!  Nice!  All right, you know something?  He never gets it wrong. 
[02:43:00]  You are amazing.  Wow.  Holy S.  You look like two miles of bad roads.  What gave it away?  Was it the Calvin Coolidge stamp on the tape?  What's the secret?  How is that possible?  It's amazing.  You know something?  It's just something that...  You learned it from your father and his father before him.  Right.  It's been passed on for generations.  I believe they found out the age of the pharaoh using the same technique in the pyramids.  It is a gift.  It's a gift.  What would you call it? 
[02:43:30]  52 years old, right?  Unless he's been with another woman.  It's a gift.  Are those lips or war bonds?  Well, after having four children.  That's great.  Well, that's why I was going to go a little older.  Four children.  It's a little rough.  A little rough.  Brian, what's going on?  Yeah.  How do you figure it out?  By, like, lip drying or something?  No, Brian, we will never know.  I am probably closer to Opie than many people.  We've worked together for years.  He will not tell me how the hell he does this, but it's amazing 100% every time. 
[02:44:00]  There's counting involved.  There is some kind of math involved.  Counting.  Yeah.  Micromotors is on there.  What do you look at?  You're stunned.  Well, it's kind of like counting rings almost.  Is it almost like rings of a tree?  Yeah, but each ring is a certain group of years.  Oh, okay.  Oh, how about that?  Isn't that something?  So, look.  Spunned and amazed.  Once again.  Colin, what do you think?  Isn't that amazing? 
[02:44:30]  It really is quite a talent.  Yeah.  You do only women or?  Yes.  He's got to market that somehow.  I practice on my cats, you know, so I get enough to come on the show and do it.  Different.  Oh, great.  Boy, thanks, man.  I know how he does it.  Now, show up.  It's amazing, Norris.  How do you know, Jim?  It's math.  It's math.  It's got something to do with the distance between one area and the other area, and you  subtract the nose clip and multiply by pi. 
[02:45:00]  Where was my nose clip?  No, where was mine?  Point missed.  Somebody dropped pennies in a dog's mouth.  How'd you like to suck my ass?  No, that's okay.  Hey, I'm Anthony.  Some cat fighters have arrived.  Really?  All right.  Is your hair turning gray now?  Shut up.  All of a sudden, he looks like Moses after he looked at the burning bush.  I have looked into the face of God Almighty.  He did turn red. 
[02:45:30]  He's still red.  That's because I was holding my breath here.  It was clean.  I hope he just stared into Mount River Rat.  Al, what's up?  I know how you do it.  I do it myself.  You have to calibrate the thickness of the callus.  All right, now I'm getting completely disgusted. 
[02:46:00]  Catfighting next, Anthony.  Would you be our music, Sway?  It's the worst.  Of the Opie and Anthony show.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Toll free, 877-692-1027 is our phone number.  Finally, we have made it to catfighting, Anthony.  I'm going to be honest with you, everyone.  I didn't think it was going to go down today.  I thought Melee was pulling our leg.  I don't know.  But, yeah, so we're just about ready for catfighting. 
[02:46:30]  Are we ready to move this mess outside for catfighting?  There you go.  Yeah, let's take it outside into the ring.  Where's everybody?  I'm out here.  Ant's out here.  All right.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Colin Quinn over there.  We have the, what a pathetic ring this is.  It's pretty much, it's a sheet that's been taped down and there's pillows underneath it that  I guess John went to Bed Bath & Beyond and bought it. 
[02:47:00]  Only the best for our show, Anthony.  Are those pillows or are those the kids from Houston?  Oh, wow.  Jesus.  You know.  Jeff.  See, Fox TV?  I guess there isn't a limit.  There is not a line.  We were talking about the line earlier with Fox.  Speaking of Fox News, Anthony.  Yeah.  You notice that more and more camera crews are showing up as we move on with this show today?  Yeah.  Oh, what's up with that? 
[02:47:30]  I think they're making excuses to come down here to cover our show today because they know  what we're doing.  Yeah, it's cat fighting.  And I'm looking forward to this.  Mele is here.  She kind of got a couple of the girls.  The girl's back there now.  Let's up.  Smoking and drinking.  I thought smoking was bad for girls.  What's that?  Because I thought you would run out of breath.  One of the cat fighters is smoking.  Yeah.  It helps you warm up.  Yeah.  It's good for my lungs.  It's pharmaceutical tobacco. 
[02:48:00]  All right.  Only pharmaceutical tobacco, just with a doctor prescribed.  All right.  By the way, what are you wearing there?  Nice little PJs.  This must have been my clothes.  PJs.  Who the hell bought that?  I guess the shoes have got to go, don't they?  You just made a really sexy girl look dull and boring.  This girl is sexy.  You guys have this pillow fight, slumber party.  Yeah.  I got you.  Who brought the pajamas?  Who are you? 
[02:48:30]  Boo.  Just the listener.  He's just the listener.  You picked some of the unsexiest pajamas.  Aha.  My God.  That girl went from a 10 to...  I don't see you, baby.  That girl went from a 10 to a 3.  Oh, I could never be a 3.  A 3, Opie.  Well, come on.  So, come on.  Who'd you get them from?  Your grandmother?  Those are awful.  I know.  Aren't those just...  I'm not going to say.  Are those maternity PJs?  I mean, what the hell is going on with those?  That's awful.  We can't do anything right. 
[02:49:00]  That's all right.  All right.  Because if it was up to us, we wouldn't...  If we left it to us, we wouldn't have any PJs.  Well, thank you for bringing them down.  No matter how unsexy they are.  Who's really turned on by the fact that I'm wearing...  Ah, no.  No one is.  You're dressed like Hester Prince.  Someone else's pajamas.  Someone else's dirty.  Those of you who've been married 20 years, and you come home, and your wife is wearing  those PJs.  That's exactly what that is.  Walking around the house.  And then she wonders why you're having an affair on the side.  Not in the mood with a greck of itch.  All right.  Who's the other...  I mean, period. 
[02:49:30]  Those are the PJs you wear.  Those are period PJs.  Right.  Period chat fighting.  Ready?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hey, hold on.  We have a bell for a reason.  And we have to talk to the other fighter.  What's your name?  Lexa Khan.  All right.  Lexa Khan.  I get it.  Lexa Khan.  Now, how many fights have you had?  This will be my first legitimate cat fight, I suppose.  What's the illegitimate ones? 
[02:50:00]  Just being a dirty, rotten fighter.  Nice.  No fair fights here.  And how many fights have you had?  Oh, I was on wrestling teams in high school, so I've been catfighting and wrestling for  longer than I'd like to say and date myself.  Some good bitch fights.  I like it.  This is sort of an unfair, you know...  Oh, you're going to lose.  But I don't know any, you know, legit, you know, wrestling maneuvers, so...  Well, maybe I'll show you a few.  Well, since it's illegal and you have to pay money to use the Michael Buffer line, let's 
[02:50:30]  just say, let's prepare to fight!  Yeah, I think it's okay.  Okay, here we go.  We are ready to, uh...  Here they go.  They're squared off.  Or what?  And they're on the pillows and...  All right.  A little leg takedown.  Oh!  Took it down like, uh...  Steve got taken down by a Tito Ortiz.  That's a professional...  Oh, there's some hair pulling.  Hair pulling is definitely...  Ooh, scissor around the neck. 
[02:51:00]  The other girl got really pissed because Tara pulled her hair.  Yeah.  Now Tara's pulling.  I'll pull back!  All right, they're pulling each other's hair.  I pull back!  Nice and hard, Anthony.  What do I have to...  Oh, she's in the scissor hole.  The scissor hole is very painful to the midsection, Opie.  This girl crushed glass.  What is this?  Shoulders to the floor?  Me?  Hell no!  I'm on top, bitch!  Do you?  Yeah.  All right, they're really fighting.  Oh, whoa!  Okay.  Whoa, nice move!  Now she's got her on the head.  Yeah, this is starting to get real serious now. 
[02:51:30]  The one in the Jan Brady blue...  Oh, now she's hitting her.  She's spanking her.  Blue PJs.  Oh, a little butt spanking going on there.  Wait, is the fight over?  I just needed a breath break.  She's out of breath!  Kick her ass!  Kick her ass!  My hair was shoved down my throat!  Her hair was shoved down her throat.  I need a worthy opponent.  Tara's not happy with her opponent.  How about one of these guys?  Get in there and rip her goddamn clothes off!  Yeah, screw the hair pulling.  Let's pull on some clothes. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah!  Here we go.  These clothes are never coming off.  There we go.  Oh, my God.  They don't rip.  Oh, great.  What'd you get?  Tough skin PJs?  Wait, I got a big party!  Oh, there they go.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, the top of the PJs.  Oh, those are ripping off now.  Completely ripped off of Tara.  Those pink ones are chain mail.  That isn't even coming off.  It's like ancient times.  Shred.  Shred.  All right.  Oh, she's got her in a chokehold.  Opie, look familiar?  Yes. 
[02:52:30]  Yes.  All right.  Oh, she's got her.  Oh, she's got her hair.  Oh, man.  The chest in the back.  Oh, man.  Nice.  And again, the scissor hold and the chokehold.  Wow, the girl on the bottom's really got the advantage.  No, she just slipped the hold.  Pulling more hair pulling.  The hair is really getting far now.  Yes, the hair is a pain in the ass.  Wow.  Wow, this is getting too real.  They're turning red.  They're getting all scratched up.  Tara's got her in a headlock. 
[02:53:00]  Oh, she's punching her in the calf.  More spanking.  Nice.  Oh, and the bra pretty much coming off now.  All right.  That white bra is kind of off the shoulder.  What the hell are you doing?  They're sizing each other up again.  Uh-oh, the bra is being pulled on now.  Yeah, now we're seeing something.  I just needed to get a little, you know.  Sorry, the jacket.  And the bra's off, and she's working like a speed bag. 
[02:53:30]  That's good.  Hey, look at that.  Oh, another takedown.  Have lost the top half of their uniform.  The top halves are gone.  They are just wearing those ridiculous little PJ shorts.  Well, the one girl has two door knockers.  Wow, she's getting choked out.  You can't make me laugh.  I already can't breathe.  She's getting choked out.  Yeah, kick her with something.  I've got to go out into the show to see the bottomless.  What?  Oh, no.  What happened?  Well, we'll all jump in and rip your panties off, I swear to God. 
[02:54:00]  I'm a flipper and a flogger and a caner, not a wrestler.  But we want to see them completely.  I think she did really well, though.  I think she did pretty good.  I don't wrestle.  What do you guys think of the legs?  And now she's smacking her boobs.  They still have underwear.  Yeah, I know.  You wrestle.  You come and play.  By the way, we know Fox News is never going to use this footage.  They better give us a copy of this tape.  I know.  I'm already tired.  All right.  Is anyone else going to wrestle here today?  I don't know. 
[02:54:30]  These guys' asses.  How about Bridget Nielsen over there?  He's been a boy.  Yeah?  Mele, the old broad's going to wrestle.  Oh, Jesus.  That's nice.  I'm called the old broad.  What are you, insane?  You're absolutely right.  His mama did not bring him up right.  No, of course not.  That's great.  When she gets you in a leg lock with those gray pubes, you look like Phil Donahue.  It's cool.  It's cool.  For a second, you look just like her.  It's great.  No, really.  Well, just for that, you're not going to see anything.  Oh, come on.  We want to see that.  Mele is about to wrestle Tara. 
[02:55:00]  Tara's already without top.  All right.  Here they go.  Oh, wow.  She's rough.  She's a tough bitch.  Look at this.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Well, Mele is kicking her ass.  Oh, Mele is brutal.  Mele is brutal.  This girl doesn't have a chance.  Now, Mele pulling her hair.  She's got it down.  She's punching her.  Oh, this is terrible.  Is this a sanctioned fight, Anthony?  This is...  Oh, God. 
[02:55:30]  Oh, man.  Guess who's not wearing underwear, Anthony.  Wow.  Doesn't it look like that scene in...  What was that one with Joan Crawford and Christina?  Because I'm not one of your fans!  Oh, biting.  Biting.  Biting going on, Anthony.  Tara's fighting back for some...  Come on.  Mele just...  Oh, she's biting her.  Nice.  Look at the teeth marks on her arms.  All over.  Oh, my God. 
[02:56:00]  Oh, I like it.  Mele is a rugged...  You're like a tank.  I told you.  All right.  All right.  Let's...  Wow.  Let's get them in the corners again and size them up again here.  Wow.  Really turning into...  Wow.  She is wild.  Oh, my God.  Ever since she got out of the tub in The Shining, I've been a fan of hers.  Who did this to you?  Listen. 
[02:56:30]  Wow.  Mele just...  I guess she has to drop some weight of the clothes, so she took them off.  Wow.  Okay, hold on.  They're sizing up again.  Tara and Mele.  Hey, Mele, what's on your right boob there?  What is that?  It's a little heart.  It's a heart?  Is it a tattoo, though, or...?  And where is your torso?  Okay, here they go.  I love his torso.  Here you go.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Nice.  Oh, man.  Now they're standing up.  Mele got her in a headlock again. 
[02:57:00]  Nice.  They're screaming.  Oh, purple nurple.  Oh, they're tweaking.  They're tweaking with the purple nurple move.  Oh, now Mele throwing her weight down on top of this girl, which could really hurt.  Feet in the air now.  Oh, she's on top of Mele now.  Oh!  Oh!  She's smacking Mele's ass.  There's slapping on all over the place now.  Her groin looks like Gorilla Monsoon.  Stinky, what's the problem over there? 
[02:57:30]  Bill Donahue's toupees coming out.  Oh, no.  I thought it was a guest appearance by George the Animal Steel here in our own studio.  Victory is mine!  You got her pinned by her ankle.  Okay.  All right.  Here's the deal.  You both have one fall here, so we got to do the third one.  All right.  Three falls.  Mele won the first one.  Tara won the second.  This is for all the marbles.  Mele, you're going to really have to... 
[02:58:00]  Oh, forget it.  I don't know what she's going to have to do.  What do I know?  I don't know what this is.  This is the scene they cut out of Vision Quest.  Colin Coyd, everyone.  Okay.  Here's Mele in the left corner.  Tara in the right corner.  You ladies ready?  This is it.  What's up, Mele?  You want some water?  Wow.  All right.  They're in their respective corners.  A little water break. 
[02:58:30]  Mele, just like an armored personnel carrier, you are like stocky.  Mele, I'm not going to make fun of you anymore, because I wouldn't.  You're serious.  And you see her eyes now?  She's all worked up.  She's in the zone.  You're good.  She's in the zone.  What?  No, I said you're in the zone.  I said you're in the zone.  That's nice.  What?  She threw water at me, Opie.  I can't believe...  It could have been worse.  I'm going to run away.  Don't make me expose myself to the big pussy I am. 
[02:59:00]  And who would want to see what you got?  Oh, bell.  There's the bell.  Start the fight.  Oh, my God.  Save me, please.  Oh, my God.  I like the way this sticks.  Oh!  Yes.  All right.  Tara with a huge takedown, Anthony.  Clip there over her back.  Nice.  Tara is kicking Mele's eggs.  I hope Tara kills Mele, because I'm screwed.  What?  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  Now they're in this trying submission holds on each other.  Oh, my God. 
[02:59:30]  He's biting Mele's arm, and that Mele's pulling her hair.  Mele's getting really pissed.  Tara bit her arm, and Mele...  Oh, now she's tweaking.  Purple Nerful.  Purple Nerful again.  She is yanking on the chest.  Wow.  Wow.  I got her.  Purple Nerful.  I have new legs.  Ooh.  Oh, yeah.  Fake me, baby.  Yeah.  Woo!  Woo!  This is horrifying.  Okay.  Tara's trying...  Uh-oh.  Oh, she's got the face hold on her.  Mele's got the face hold.  Tara's trying to fight her way out, Anthony. 
[03:00:00]  Tara having trouble with that Mele.  Oh, no.  Tara got loose.  Tara on top of...  Oh, kicks Mele down.  But Mele really holding her own here.  She's on top of Mele.  Get in there with the mic, Sticks.  There's a senior citizen being beaten.  Hey, Norton.  Why are you saying that, Norton?  About Mele?  Okay.  I get the cup of water.  I've been a kind of...  Oh!  I'm caught in the choke hold.  Mele, is she tapping out? 
[03:00:30]  Is she tapping out?  It's over.  She tapped out and Merge is victorious.  Mele tapped out.  Caught in the choke hold.  Wow, that was...  Now they're hugging.  Look at that.  Sportsmanship, Anthony.  Yeah.  Tara, how do you feel?  I feel great.  Yeah.  I feel great.  Unbelievable.  I won fair and square.  Wow.  Great job.  Wow.  I've ever fought for her.  Yeah.  She's good, huh?  It's the first time we fought.  She's good.  She's good, too.  Mele, how do you feel?  How do you feel, Mele? 
[03:01:00]  I feel stimulated.  Did you hear all the...  The adrenaline is just pumping.  Unbelievable.  Did you hear all the rude comments  that this man was saying?  You think I give a...  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  I hear ya.  Okay, she said.  Do you think I give an F?  Do I get to keep these PJs?  Yeah.  Yes.  They're different from my normal latex and leather.  I know.  Think of it that way, alright?  This is not fake.  This is real.  Your adrenaline is pumping  and everything you got goes into this, alright?  Hey, are there any guys  that want to fight Mele? 
[03:01:30]  No one is!  Any guys want to get in there with Mele?  Give it a whirl?  Rick is even saying no.  No?  Any guys?  No.  Wow, look at that.  Give him a headlock over there.  She scared everyone away.  No one wants to fight her.  Yep.  Meow.  I'll say it first.  I ain't fighting.  What, Mele?  He doesn't have what it takes  and he's not a sports person.  Oh, Jim?  I mean, yeah.  Yeah, you can kick Jim's ass.  Probably, yeah.  He's a small loser.  Yeah, I'll made me by four counties. 
[03:02:00]  Hell for you.  Okay.  Why don't we take a break  and we'll figure this out.  Alright.  Sounds good.  We're catfighting on the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Stay there.  Hey, this is Colin Quinn  and you're listening to the worst of O.B. and Anthony.  O.B. and Anthony.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  It was awful.  Worthless.  They're the worst.  Just screaming every racial epithet.  You can think of an abomination.  It's the worst of the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Robert, you have a lot of fat around your pubes.  Oh, shit. 
[03:02:30]  Oh, my God.  Who's that?  Who is this?  I'm Ted  and I work for Ted's pubes spinning company.  Well, yeah.  Actually, I have a little bush fat around my pubes.  Can I recommend some tape?  If you tape your pubes all the way around your back,  your penis will spinger.  What, do they have special pube tape or something?  Yes, it's silver.  And it's sold at hardware stores.  What's it called?  Duct tape, fatso. 
[03:03:00]  Ted, the pubes fat.  Ted, the pubes fat thinner.  So will it actually work?  Will it make my dick bigger?  Ted?  Will it make my dick bigger?  Yes, it pushes your pubes.  What do you push him?  Do you pick him back?  Oh, God.  Look at the pubes fat on this fucking guy.  Oh, Danny just pushed up a picture.  This guy's got no dick.  That's Larry.  He's from Ronkakama.  Wow.  Some people really don't take care of themselves. 
[03:03:30]  He was stricken with pubes.  How high is it?  That guy's pubes fat completely engulfs any genitals.  Wow.  That is the biggest bush fat I've ever seen.  You could fuck him.  It's like when a tree grows around a sign.  Yeah.  That's what happened.  When I was driving down the highway, you see that no passing sign halfway in an oak tree.  You laugh, but you don't know the agony of what he feels when everyone's throwing pebbles at his fatty pubes. 
[03:04:00]  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony Show.  I got something fun for everybody.  Ooh, a fun sound clip.  This is going to be fun for everyone.  Listen to this.  Faith Mitchell has Down syndrome, and considering the statistics, she's lucky to be celebrating her fourth birthday.  The fact is, an overwhelming majority of parents who find out their baby will likely be born with Down syndrome choose to terminate the pregnancy. 
[03:04:30]  Many people, including Faith's parents, believe doctors are partially to blame for the high rate of Down syndrome abortions.  Blame?  Blame?  Doctors are to blame?  That's what you're supposed to do.  Holy shit.  No, let's be real here.  Obviously, if you have a baby and it has Down syndrome, I'm not, you know, ridiculous.  You love the child.  You raise it.  You do whatever you do, just like you do with any other kid. 
[03:05:00]  I'm sure it's more difficult.  Whatever.  I thought you were going to say, just like you would do with a puppy.  Not well, you know.  I'm just saying, but if you know and have the opportunity to terminate, you're going to fucking do it.  Why be burdened?  Doctors are blamed.  How about that fucking fifth of old granddad while the fucking womb was still full?  Fucking mom.  How about that?  The old topple down the stairs for being lippy.  How about that? 
[03:05:30]  Oh, God damn.  For the high rate of Down syndrome abortions, which some studies put as high as 90%.  Yeah.  They give you a bleak picture.  You go out there and you're scared.  You don't know what to do because you have preco...  You think of all these great things and it's all like taken away from you in an instant.  The Mitchell say during those gut-wrenching minutes after the diagnosis,  they got the feeling that their doctors were pressuring them to abort faith.  The focus, they say, was on the medical difficulties many children with Down syndrome have, 
[03:06:00]  like heart trouble and how hard they are to raise due to their learning disability.  We know why.  They even told me that it could be a burden on my son as he grows up.  They don't need to explain why it's hard to raise a child with Down syndrome.  Because he's always winning the spelling bee.  I give up.  The only one it's easy on is the barber.  He knows right away.  Okay. 
[03:06:30]  The number two.  You have a choice.  One or two.  Jimmy, come back.  Jimmy, come back.  Oh, my God.  I'm so far away.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  What's that fucking funny, man?  Ready for this?  This next clip is only 40 seconds long, but I'm thinking it could take 20 minutes to play. 
[03:07:00]  Oh, no.  What is it?  It could be one of those things.  The Mitchells and others raising children with Down syndrome say they want doctors to give  expecting parents a more complete picture, including the positive points.  Okay.  All right.  A stamp licker.  I could lick a whole fucking mat at one time.  If you need a piano moved. 
[03:07:30]  You need to post huge genitals on the internet.  If you want something with the...  A fleshy piggy bank.  They do love their change.  Including the positive points.  Positive points?  If you enjoy saying, hey, Charlie Hustle. 
[03:08:00]  Oh, no.  Positive points.  Yes, positive points.  I'd love to hear a couple.  Picture, including the positive points.  They're special.  They're the most living people you ever meet in your life.  And I think they deserve a chance.  Doctors are not prepared.  That's positive points.  They deserve a shot.  They're special.  They're the most loving people you'll ever meet.  I don't know about that.  I don't know if that could be held up.  They also love bricks and trees. 
[03:08:30]  And throwing them at your head every so often.  And I think they deserve a chance.  Doctors are not prepared when it comes to delivering that diagnosis.  Dr. Brian Scottko, who is a sister with Down syndrome, authored a 2005 study while he was in medical school that showed that most parents of children with Down syndrome thought that doctors indeed focused on worst-case scenarios.  The medical community has heard the complaints.  What are you supposed to focus on? 
[03:09:00]  I mean, the complaints are from people, obviously, that have Down syndrome children.  It's not from the people that aborted them.  It's not, you know, and obviously you can understand why they would be upset.  You know, it's like anything else.  If you get a, you have a child and there's anything wrong with it or something, you're not going to hate the kid.  You've got to raise it.  You've got to kind of pay attention to it, I guess.  Because you always hear that. 
[03:09:30]  It's like, well, when we first heard or found out, it was very difficult.  But, oh, my God, she's so special and so smart in such special ways.  Really?  The only one that's easy on is the part.  We're officially not doing line of the day today.  Just the fucker.  They all have that stupid hairdo.  Oh, that hair.  At least get one a perm.  Do something.  Yeah, permanent. 
[03:10:00]  You've got yourself a permanent.  Don't wind up getting things caught in it.  It has to just be simple.  You know, I don't know what to do.  Not that imaginary light bulb.  Bing.  Pauly from Australia.  Oh, the idea.  Dopes, yes.  Pauly from Australia.  Right.  Loving.  Of course they are loving.  They love that you didn't drown the fucking waterhead at birth.  Oh, fuck.  See, I'm trying to be a realist without being too harsh. 
[03:10:30]  I mean, of course we're having fun here.  But for God's sake, if you know that it's going to happen and the doctor suggests aborting it.  What the fuck?  Yeah.  The last clip, we've got a couple that terminated the pregnancy and guess what?  They want it back?  They feel no guilt whatsoever.  Really?  Joey and Jeff terminated a pregnancy more than two years ago after receiving a Down syndrome diagnosis.  They didn't want us to use their last names.  They say the decision was very difficult for them, but they have no regrets.  I did not feel any guilt about it. 
[03:11:00]  They're the moron makers.  They say they didn't get the feeling that their doctors pushed them in any one direction,  but they say many people made them feel bad for deciding to have an abortion.  Here we are going through a loss and there are people out there,  there are a lot of people out there who look down on what we chose to do.  Down.  Since then, they've had a child with no birth defects.  There you go.  The Mitchells say they never considered aborting faith but are very careful not to judge anyone who makes that choice 
[03:11:30]  because they say as sure as they are that they made the right decision,  they also know how difficult it is to have that decision to make.  When the doctor comes in with the diagnosis sheets and he's flipping through the pages with a hanger,  you know that he's probably trying to push you in a certain direction.  He takes both of your coats but he's got three hangers. 
[03:12:00]  Look, I don't want to push.  Oh, fucking hilarious.  Oh, shit.  He's got a holder but there's no rug in here.  Oh, no.  It's ridiculous.  He's got a holder.  You're going to put his back three.  Anthony's on fire with the retard star.  With the retard star. 
[03:12:30]  You've got to be a realist.  Walter in Chicago.  Walter.  What's happening?  Hey, Walter.  How are we doing today?  Pretty good.  Hi.  You know, the comp syndrome people are, they are actually a wonderful type of person  because they give you so much to look at.  They don't even try.  They're just funny.  Jesus.  What do you mean?  That took a turn?  Yeah. 
[03:13:00]  Without even trying, they care so much about everybody else besides themselves.  And I've got a person that's been in my family for 51 years.  Severe Down syndrome.  Wow.  Another four years, she'll make it into the Guinness Book of World Records for being the oldest.  How old is the oldest?  62 is in the record books right now.  So, I mean, they don't, without even trying, they do give you a lot of joy in life, but 
[03:13:30]  they do take a lot of work.  Yeah.  You know, I'm not going to say that they don't, but it is funny that they can bring you so much  joy, but they do take a lot of work.  That's the same thing as restoring a classic car.  Right.  It brings a lot of joy, but it takes a lot of work.  Yeah.  We're playing golf.  And the car is smarter.  Yeah, the car's in Edsel.  What are we doing to this guy?  What?  He's been 59 years or something. 
[03:14:00]  Yeah.  What's the relation?  What?  What's the relation?  An uncle or an answer?  No, it's just, it's somebody who was orphaned.  Oh.  What?  They adopt?  You would?  Wow.  Wow.  That wasn't very nice.  The Lord has a place for you in heaven, my friend.  Well, he didn't adopt a 60-year-old Down syndrome guy.  Yeah.  He didn't adopt a 60-year-old Down syndrome guy or woman?  It's a woman.  Oh, wow. 
[03:14:30]  Was it your parents adopted that or?  No, actually grandparents.  Your grandparents adopted a Down syndrome child.  A retarded girl to help her out.  Wow.  Yeah.  That's nice.  Way back in the olden days?  Yeah, well, you know, about two weeks ago.  A while ago.  How many hockey helmets has she gone through?  Actually, none.  Yeah.  They rarely wear hockey helmets, Down syndrome kids.  It's usually kids that, like, have autism and other things.  They're banging their heads around.  All right, Walter.  Good for you, man. 
[03:15:00]  Congrats.  All right, man.  Have a good one.  All right.  Let's go to Steve in California.  Steve.  Hey.  Guys, I've been listening to you guys since the Trainable videos, and I've got a  Sun-O-Town syndrome who absolutely, I've got to agree with Walter.  He makes us laugh all the time.  He says some of the crazy shit, like the, I like to make wearable movies.  Really?  But it's his own thing.  Yeah, he's got his own thing.  He's totally into the MASH TV show and runs around and thinks that the Korean War is still 
[03:15:30]  going on.  Of course he's into MASH.  I'm going to pound on him and say, ow, three weeks ended a long time ago.  Oh, jeez.  I'll tell you what, he's one of the strongest kids I've ever met.  Of course he is.  He's 58.  He can outbend first.  He's hawk brain pierced.  Exactly.  Does he understand MASH?  What's that?  Does he understand the show, MASH?  Oh, he knows who the funny people are and he knows who the stupid people are and, you 
[03:16:00]  know, he'll, he'll pull up lines, we'll be, he'll rattle out a line on that.  Trapped in the john.  Brain of the john.  Oh, um.  Oh, I can't get any.  Oh, God.  Hawk brain pierced.  I punted out.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Yeah, it seems a lot of people have fun with their, uh, down syndrome kids. 
[03:16:30]  Oh, sure.  Like, you got to make, you know, lemonade out of those lemons, I guess.  And, uh, they seem to just laugh.  It seems like that, that's what people are doing.  They're laughing.  Well, and they love them, but I'm personally waiting for the robots, so, uh, it's a bit  much.  Hawk brain pierced.  Do we have a little song we can play for the folks out there?  Oh, do we?  Sure we do.  Let's, let's go with this.  Uh-oh. 
[03:17:00]  I'll do this one.  When I was a boy of ten, I had a very special friend.  Ed was kind, with good intents, but just a little different.  Oh, special Ed.  His mama dropped him, dropped him on his head.  Now he's not so bright instead. 
[03:17:30]  He's a little bit special.  Just a little bit special.  Oh, we'd play tag, and he'd get hurt.  I'd play soldier, he'd, he'd dirt.  I like math and the spelling bee.  Ed like talking to a tree.  Oh, special Ed. 
[03:18:00]  His mama, mama dropped him, dropped him on his head.  Now she keeps him in the shed.  Cause he's a little bit special.  Just a little bit special.  I ran track, hung out in malls.  Ed ran headfirst in two halls.  I had girly girls and lots of clothes. 
[03:18:30]  Ed had names for all his toes.  Like Larry and Terry and Jerry and Barry and Ronnie and Bobby and Ricky and Mike.  And if I love a girl who cares who you like, it's a special Ed.  His mama, mama dropped him, dropped him on his head.  Now he thinks he's a piece of bread.  Cause he's a little bit better.  Just a little bit better. 
[03:19:00]  Hey.  I thought college life was great.  Ed could count from one to two.  I like people and the party scene.  Ed was scared of the vacuum cleaner special.  Ed, his mama, mama dropped him, dropped him on his head.  Now his favorite color is the radio. 
[03:19:30]  Cause he's a little bit better.  Oh, just a little bit.  One day talking to special Ed.  He grabbed a brick and he swung at my head.  And as he laughed at me, that's when I knew  that special Ed just made me special too.  Ha!  My shoes hurt! 
[03:20:00]  Now I laugh as I count bugs.  I give strangers great big hugs.  Next to me, it is fine.  Yeah, he's a fucking Einstein.  Oh, special Ed and me.  Now we're not right in the head, you see.  Now we're not so, not so bright instead. 
[03:20:30]  We're a little bit special.  Just a little bit special.  That fuck red made me special.  Just a little bit.  Just a little bit special. 
[03:21:00]  Watch them run.  Watch them fall.  Watch them try to catch a ball.  Special Olympics.  Special Olympics.  Oh, boy!  Watch them laugh.  Watch them drool.  Watch them fall into the pool.  That's diving.  At the Special Olympics. 
[03:21:30]  You're trying to take pity.  And I know full well  That I will burn in hell  But those guys playing wheelchair basketball  Gotta be about the funniest freaking thing I've ever seen in my life  At the Special Olympics. 
[03:22:00]  Special Olympics!  Take it, Corky!  At the Special Olympics!  Oh, you're so pretty.  You can sing at my wedding when I get married.  There you go.  Steven Lynch with a twofer on this twofer Tuesday.  I've been laughing at fucking Anthony's  Cracks the whole fucking break.  The mash.  Hawk brain pierce.  Hawk brain pierce.  I thought of one.  What?  Should have been a BJ honey. 
[03:22:30]  Let's go to Bill in Charleston.  Bill!  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey, Bill.  Oh, Bill!  Hey.  I had a buddy of mine.  That had a brother that's got Down Syndrome.  He's probably 52, 53.  And we used to take him to baseball games and stuff  Because he could get to special seats.  But everywhere you took the guy,  He had to take a shit. 
[03:23:00]  And he would use the whole roll  And stomp up the bull  And then come in wherever you're at  And say you needed a ponder.  And embarrass the shit out of you.  And he cut his mustache in a Hitler mustache.  Carded Hitler?  Give all the Jews raises!  He did it all wrong.  He did it all wrong.  He did it all wrong.  Hitler.  He was just nice to everybody.  Nice.  Thank you, Bill.  Let's go to Jason in Syracuse. 
[03:23:30]  Jason.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, sorry to hear you guys got dropped in Syracuse.  That sucks.  Well, you know, they want to do Shut Up and Rock.  What can I tell you?  That shit sucks.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll listen to you guys the next time.  But yeah, I got a good friend.  He's got an uncle with Down syndrome.  And he's like, he's got the mind of like a 12-year-old.  But he's like really good at video games.  And does a lot of athletic activities.  He's pretty cool.  I don't think he shits as much as the last guy I said is.  I probably did. 
[03:24:00]  But yeah, at the YMCA, there's always a bunch of kids that are puking or shitting in the  pools.  What happened?  Is this talk about your retard Tuesday?  They just get on the phone and talk about that.  Boy, they're living a lot longer, though, I guess.  God bless them.  They're the last three.  Really?  Did he?  Yeah.  What was that?  God bless them.  Wolverine?  Well, they don't have to worry about gas prices and taxes.  So maybe there is a little blessing going on.  Ignorance is bliss, they say. 
[03:24:30]  That's right.  Totally.  Full of fucking bliss.  This is John Waters.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  It's a madhouse.  We got to calm down, man.  I got to tell you right now.  The worst.  I am the worst.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  It is the worst.  The fucking worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[03:25:00]  That's the worst idea I've ever heard in my life.  Kenny.  That's annoying.  We owe you an apology.  You got a bare bottom spanking today for no reason whatsoever.  I don't mind.  Well, fortunately, Dan Ederman is never going to be booked on the show again, so you needed  to get it anyway.  I will have Dan back.  I'm just kidding.  And Kenny, it's also probably a lot similar to what you used to do when you were a cop.  He was probably guilty of something anyway.  Exactly.  Yeah, so you deserved it.  Who am I to complain? 
[03:25:30]  Kenny.  Can I have another?  No.  No.  Another.  Now it's creepy.  There was a guy on the line, but he hung up.  Go for him.  He said he bought the car that you shot up when you were a police officer.  Is there any story there that you'd like to share?  Wow.  Which one?  Which one?  This guy swears he bought a car that you shot up.  I guess it was a big get.  Maybe that guy could call back.  Did you put a couple of holes in a vehicle there, Kenny? 
[03:26:00]  Oh, back in the day, you were allowed to let some lead fly.  Oh, those were the days.  The days where you didn't have to count your bullets, right?  Modern technology ruined everything.  Oh, totally.  You know.  If they had cameras in the cars when I was in a radio car, I'd be in the penitentiary now.  This is like what people from the Third Reich, this is how they tell stories.  Back in the day, we could really, you know. 
[03:26:30]  It was wonderful.  We could rape people and their daughters and their fathers at the same time, and it was fantastic.  Nobody said anything.  No trouble.  Now with the Internet, you can't do any of that.  And the camera's in the cars, right, Kenny?  Yeah, yeah.  Video cameras ruined policing.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Saw a guy yesterday, that guy that had a police chase, and he wound up clipping an SUV, and  the SUV flipped over and slid on its roof, and then the guy gets out of the car and starts 
[03:27:00]  running.  An officer got him, and then they put the camera on him for a couple of seconds, and he was  getting a little, how do you do, from the officer.  Yeah, see, before the camera, everything was an accident.  Was that it?  Yeah.  He trapped.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was an accident.  Fell down the stairs.  It was an accident.  Yeah.  Fell down the stairs.  How bad would it be to accidentally fall down the stairs during an arrest?  Because you know it was pick you up by the collar and the seat of your pants, and you 
[03:27:30]  were flying down the stairs.  You know what was a good alibi?  Hypothetically speaking.  Of course, of course.  If you got in a car chase, and the shittims crashed, you know, anything that happened  to him happened during the crash.  Oh, so, you know, if his teeth got knocked out, it hit the steering wheel.  Before airbags.  Yeah.  No airbags.  Seatbelt.  We got the guy that has the car. 
[03:28:00]  Steve, Jersey.  Hey, you got it a little bit wrong.  I impounded one of the cars that Kenny had some fun with.  It was down on Park Ave at that Sunoco station, and these guys tried to run him over, and  Kenny probably let about six or seven bullets into the car.  I might add, I only took two shots, but I swear to God, and I was the only one justified.  Everybody else that shot, it was kind of questionable.  Oh, my God. 
[03:28:30]  You only took two shots.  It was the best that he was driving.  Two out of the six that made the car?  I don't know.  That was like another Sean Bell thing, where everybody just surrounded the car and was  like shooting.  Oh, God.  As the car pulled away, thank God the statute of limitations is up.  Sure.  As the car pulled away, one guy actually got down on one knee and was shooting at the car  when it was like 200 yards down the street.  Oh, and that's a no-no.  Yeah.  You can't do that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But now he was trying to run you over? 
[03:29:00]  Excuse me, sir?  The car looked like Swiss cheese after they finished with it.  So, Kenny, the guy was trying to run you over?  No, what happened was it was a drug deal that had gone bad.  Of course.  We had this female informant, you know, and she says, this guy, you know, she can call  him, you know, have him deliver something, and he always carries a gun.  And we're like, okay.  Oh, boy.  So, we set it up that we were going to meet him at this pay phone at a gas station, right?  Right. 
[03:29:30]  And we told her, whatever you do, don't get in the car.  We must have told her a thousand times, don't get in the car.  Whatever you do, don't get in the car.  So, me and my partner was at the gas pumps pretending like we were getting gas.  Another car was parked across the street in this parking lot, and a third car was on  a side street parked, all right?  And when the shittums pulled up, all right, what is the first thing she did?  She got in the car, like we told her a thousand times not to do, all right?  So, when, you know, so when that happened, and then they were going to pull away, we went 
[03:30:00]  to surround them, all right?  And, you know, the shittums have all the luck.  He squeaked.  You know, we had three shittums.  I don't even follow this.  They're the bad guys.  All right.  Yeah.  The shittums.  All right.  Why shittums?  That's like an endearing term.  I feel like you're the shittums in the story.  That's how I feel about it.  No, Kenny rules in this.  Yeah.  Kenny's the hero.  Kenny, hurry up, because we've got Dana White on the phone here. 
[03:30:30]  I got to hear this.  No, so anyway, we tried to block him in.  He squeaked out by a cunt hair.  I don't know how he missed the gas pumps, all right?  Wow.  And then, you know, they had two guns.  They had a .45 and a .38.  We had our shit, and, you know.  You started shooting into the car with the informant in it?  Well, that was the whole thing.  Oh, Jesus.  Here's the thing about when Kenny tells stories like this, he really lights up. 
[03:31:00]  Oh, yeah.  It makes me think that the rest of the time, he's pretending to be retarded.  I'm like, no, no, no.  Kenny's really smart and with it.  He's very smart when it comes to seeing a police officer.  He's an idiot savant with police work.  Anything else, he's retarded.  But police work was always.  It makes him happy to talk about the old days.  Look at his smile.  Did any of the guys get hit in the car?  Well, they took off.  Right.  Right, and then, like, so we had to chase him, run him off the road, and then, you know, 
[03:31:30]  there's like a dozen cars, all right?  Yeah, yeah.  And so everybody gets ripped out of the car and gets beaten, you know.  So one of the guys grabbed the informant and was, like, whipping her ass.  So, like, I had to, you know, like, grab her away from him and, you know.  And take care of that.  All's ends.  All's.  Well, that ends well.  And for some reason, I was spanking you earlier today.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Danny was at a funeral. 
[03:32:00]  Yeah, yesterday.  I'm so sorry.  There was a death.  We didn't hear the...  I'm working the crowd today.  Sound effects today.  They're just so terribly...  They're just terrible things.  Funerals.  Like, who...  Who thought up that shit?  Why is that a good idea?  I gotta say, I'm not a fan.  Nah.  No.  Well, no one's actually, like, um...  Close the box.  Funeral, yay.  Yeah, but why do you have to, like, have everyone together and... 
[03:32:30]  Right.  And, you know, at the funeral, I find them to be just extremely phony and disingenuine.  It's just like, you know, you get up there and you say nice things.  The guy could have been a fucking asshole.  But no one's gonna say that.  They're gonna go, oh, he was a great man.  He was humble.  And he was this.  Will they say he was a great man?  You say all this stuff that you should have said when they were alive.  I knew my dad was at the end of his life and I wanted to put a roast together and I never did.  And it pisses me off to this day.  Because then at his wake, it was pretty much a roast. 
[03:33:00]  Everyone's saying great things about it.  I was like, well, this would have been wonderful if he was sitting in that chair over there enjoying a cold beverage.  Who passed away?  I mean, I know.  But do people know who died?  No, it was my grandfather on my mother's side.  Sorry to hear that, Danny.  Yeah, it was a sad thing.  Did you cry at all?  Well, you know, we weren't really so close.  So, I mean, it was sad.  Why weren't you close?  It just, I'm just, that whole side of the family was never really.  My family's really weird.  Dude, holler, me and you, bro. 
[03:33:30]  We were just never tight.  We were just.  I got one side of my family I don't know anything about.  Nothing.  That's kind of how it was.  I have an aunt I have not seen.  Oh, boy.  Let's just make believe I'm older than I really am.  I haven't seen an aunt in over 30 years.  Wow.  And she's still alive somewhere.  She's not even a family member at that point.  Would you see her?  Absolutely.  Did she come to, like, the high school graduation?  No, no.  Oh, thanks.  I mean, Jimmy, no.  Grammar school graduation.  Grammar school graduation.  What's wrong with you? 
[03:34:00]  So, Dan, you guys weren't that close?  Not really.  I mean, you know, it's just weird because, like, you know, just the way that you grow  up is just a weird thing.  And, like, they lived on my block, too.  Like, back when I was a kid, like, we lived in, like, apartment, like, co-ops, like, apartment  buildings.  And we were in one building on the block and then both sets of grandparents were in the  other building.  So, you figured, you know, you can't get closer than that.  But we never really, you know, we never really connected.  Like, when I was a teenager, like, there was not a lot of interaction there.  What did I have?  You guys were adopted, huh? 
[03:34:30]  I must have been.  I don't know.  But, no, it turns out he was fine, like, two weeks ago.  He had trouble breathing, right?  Oh, boy.  So, they bring him to the hospital and they run tests.  And it turns out he has inoperable lung cancer.  Was he a smoker?  He was 40 years ago.  Oh, boy, that's a slow burn.  And it's just, you know, it's a tragic thing.  But, at the same time, the guy never went to get checked out regularly.  So, I mean, how do you go that long without knowing that you have, you know, lung cancer? 
[03:35:00]  Like, when you can't breathe because of your lung cancer, it's too late now.  You can't now go decide it's a good time to go to the hospital.  Oh, yeah.  He made it to 81, though.  Yeah.  That's not a bad contract.  That's where Opie says, good luck, bro, with the lung cancer.  You know, and, like, my dad was telling me this tragic story.  I was at his house for Father's Day and he told me that he got so bad in the hospital that he couldn't even talk.  So, it would hurt, I guess, to breathe.  So, they wrote the alphabet on a piece of paper like a Ouija board. 
[03:35:30]  And he was pointing to letters.  And he pointed to save me.  No way.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Yeah, that's crazy and, like, morbid and everything.  But, at the same time, like, if you just went to the doctor five years ago, you could have kind of saved yourself, in a way.  I mean, you could have at least gotten treated for it.  I bet it was probably treatable or operable.  Did they pull it away after he did that?  Or was he, like, going for save me some jello?  Because that isn't half as depressing and sad as save me as save me some of that jello. 
[03:36:00]  I don't know.  I wasn't there for that.  That's the only box.  That's very depressing.  It is.  It's horribly depressing.  Save me.  Because he knows he's dead and you know you can't.  What are you going to say?  What would they respond to?  I don't know, unfortunately.  I get all this information secondhand because I don't really talk to my mother.  You need to do, like, a frequency where, you know, you tell them, hey, you smoke, you've got to stop smoking.  Or you get the lung cancer.  And then Dennis Quaid can save his son later on in the movie. 
[03:36:30]  Or you've got to go to Doc Brown and set the time machine.  I mean, it's a terrible thing.  But, like, just my observation from the funeral, it was just, you know, he didn't have a lot of money.  He didn't have any money.  And he died in debt.  So, obviously, it couldn't be, like, a really extravagant funeral or anything.  So, it was just a plain, like, the plain, unfinished pine coffin.  Oh, no.  One of those.  Dude, it looked like a soldier coffin kind of thing. 
[03:37:00]  You know what I'm saying?  Like, it was just.  What's the difference?  Well, to me, they throw guilt at you when they fucking make you shop for coffins after your loved one dies.  Dude, I totally agree.  It's the whole thing.  And it's like they have a really nice lighting, literally, over the really good ones.  And then, like, oh, or you could get that over there.  And it's the pine box in the dark.  Penn and Teller did a fantastic episode of bullshit.  It's the God's honest truth, though, man.  About the business of dying.  Fucking assholes.  All of them.  It really is.  It's exactly what you're saying.  It's just, it's, they guilt you into spending all this money.  So, I agree with the fact that, like, you know, why spend money on a great coffin, regardless. 
[03:37:30]  But still, you look at it and you're just like, hmm.  Yeah.  That's just.  And the fact of the matter is, he was in that because there wasn't enough money for anything else.  Right.  So, if you have a shitload of money and you decide to go with the box because it's, you know, it's all bullshit, that's one thing.  If they're in the box because, you know, that's all there is.  Yeah, and, you know, it was a, you know, closed, you know, closed coffin.  Yeah.  You know, I'm assuming because, you know, like, there was, you know, no money to pay for, like, a makeup person. 
[03:38:00]  I'm sure there wasn't a whole lot of padding and crap in there, you know what I'm saying?  Oh, yeah.  You know, and then, like, you know.  Yeah, but closed coffins are the thing to do now.  Only, oh, well, he's old.  That's right.  Yeah.  The old school way is to do the open coffin.  I mean, I went to a funeral for somebody, for somebody's great grandmother.  She was 103.  They did open coffin.  Wow.  You know.  She looked better.  She looked better.  Her legs were up in the air.  That was a shit.  Why not?  What a goof that'd be.  You cover the face and just fucking show her a box.  You pop her legs like your hanger.  Holy fuck. 
[03:38:30]  No, you hang her fucking legs outside the thing, and then you leave a sign on the front of the coffin.  Fucks for a buck.  That's right.  What you can do is, just like a charitable thing, is you can give her a good fucking, a good finger bang.  You can fucking jam your fingers in.  And maybe you put like gummy, gummy bears or gumballs in there.  You can fucking fiddle around in there and grab yourself a sucking candy.  Oh, you fucking sick. 
[03:39:00]  You're a ghoul.  Why not?  How funny would that be?  She's 103.  Fuck her.  Hit her in her fart box.  Oh, you fucking, when, when, when my grandmother on my father's side died, this was like really just some perspective.  She got cremated.  So the remains are in a fucking shoe box.  And, and her husband, Norm, Norman, he just goes to the trunk.  We pull into the cemetery.  He goes to the trunk and just pulls out this shoe box with the name Mildred written on the side. 
[03:39:30]  And it's like, that's what your fucking life amounts to.  You're being put in a hole now in a fucking shoe box with your name on the side.  Good riddance.  That's exactly how this was.  Cause what, like, you know how most, most funerals, like regular funerals, there's like flower displays and there's pictures and all these things that people send.  Get well soon.  Oops.  Too late.  There was like, there was like three pictures that they took off the wall of his, his, you know, roach infested apartment. 
[03:40:00]  And then like, and then like a decoupage, you know, that like the, the other grandkids made of like, you know, him and, you know, like sports teams that he liked.  And it was just awful and like crinkled and it was, it wasn't on like firm, firm, like cardboard stock.  Like it was just shitty kind of construction.  But it was like curving and.  Oh, it was like starting to fold and roll up.  It was like propped up on an easel.  And I'm just watching this, just going like, this guy lived for 81 years.  That's so depressing.  Like he was, he was in like wars and stuff. 
[03:40:30]  And like, this is what his day amounts to.  Like his big death day, it's fucking like 12 people and an unfinished coffin with a few pictures that they just took off the wall of his apartment.  It has war stories with buddies and all that.  And that's what it amounts to.  Here's a decoupage that's crinkling in the easel and a few pictures on the fucking wall.  I wasn't out of that service, that funeral service for 30 seconds.  I looked at my father.  I said, I was like, whatever, if anything ever happens to me, this is, will not be happening.  That ain't it. 
[03:41:00]  I do not want this at all.  No way.  Was there any love in the room, though?  Was it like, was it where people at least, because you know, if you got a shitty decoupage, it ruins any occasion.  But I mean, as we all know.  But I mean, was it, or was the vibe in it weird in the room?  Well, for me it was.  I can't really answer that, honestly, I guess, because, you know, most of that family I don't talk to.  You know, like my mother and her brothers, like I don't get along with them at all.  So, and then there's, you know, there were some people that I haven't seen in 15 years.  So, it was weird for, I couldn't be comfortable there for, you know, at all. 
[03:41:30]  Really?  Yeah, and then just, it was hard, because like, you know, you just know that, and like, you just kind of, I'm just sitting there kind of smiling and gritting my teeth, because I'm not going to obviously be a douchebag at somebody's funeral.  But, you know, just, I did notice, you know, just how kind of creepily depressing and how, like, miserable the whole thing was.  And like, I almost actually started laughing, because my brother gave like a eulogy speech that just kept going on and on and on.  And like, I was just wishing that like, there was a red light that you could just start flicking on.  Ah, like the comics, get them with the red light.  Like, some Oscars music.  Yeah, that's what he needed. 
[03:42:00]  How long did he talk for?  Uh, my brother was probably talking for a solid, solid six minutes.  Which, I mean, that's long.  That's long.  Considering that, uh, his, my grandfather's son probably spoke for half of that.  Was there a lot of ums in it?  Like, um, and he, um.  No, he did pretty good.  No, he did good.  He just had to get into every little detail of the man's life.  Yeah.  Really.  It was just a fucking depressing thing.  It's the worst.  I hate when they try to tell a moving story about someone who died, but it's not moving. 
[03:42:30]  No.  You know, and that man, and then there was this, I locked my keys inside the car, and he waited until the police showed up.  Shut up.  Well, you know.  Fuck Dylan, fuck him.  And before the, before the, before the personal eulogy is that, you know, the rabbi, you know, sits there, stands there and says shit, you know.  And it was like, dude, it was just like, you know, I, if I died, I would like for someone to, you know, list off, like, the good accomplishments that I had.  Like, the best thing that they could come up with was that, like, he played basketball back in, like, the 50s for Brooklyn College. 
[03:43:00]  Wow.  Like, he was a bench warmer.  I think he played one game at the Garden, and, uh, and that he worked as a credit manager for a pajama company.  It's like, wow.  Holy shit.  And then the rabbi's done with him, so he just kind of goes, gentlemen, and then these fucking goons come in and just start wheeling the coffin away.  It's just a terrible way to end your life.  Rabbi, you're part Jew?  Yeah, my whole family's Jew.  Holy shit.  Yeah, he's Borat.  Know that?  I can't, I can't play with you anymore.  That Ross, that's not even my real last name, to be honest.  Rothstein?  No, the story goes, I don't know, I don't know how much. 
[03:43:30]  Ross Bank?  Hyman, Ross Bank.  The story goes, uh, when, uh, uh, I think my great-great-grandparents, wherever the hell, uh, they, they were, and where they came, they, my, whoever he was, was very soft-spoken, and when he got off the boat on Ellis Island, he was trying to say Krauss, and they, they couldn't understand what he was saying.  And they just, they got fed up with him, and they were like, alright, Ross, wow, they do that all the time, those Ellis Island people were really good at that.  What's your name, fucking, alright, whatever.  They couldn't be bothered getting it correct. 
[03:44:00]  Yeah.  And you walked around like a zombie for a few days?  For a few days, I mean, he, they, he died on Sunday morning, and, uh, the funeral was Monday morning.  Oh, wow.  Oh, the Jews plant them fast.  Yeah, they do it quick.  You know, cause then, cause then, you do, you do all the other horse shit that, like, I think the Christians do, you do that after the funeral, like the whole going to the house, and, you know.  Did you sit shiver?  Yeah, well, yeah, that's...  We had to sit shiver.  Depends on how cold it is.  Oh.  Give me a blanket.  But at least, that's not, that's not so, it's not, that's really not a depressing thing. 
[03:44:30]  No, the Catholics are ridiculous.  They parade that fucking dead body around for a week.  Like fucking James Brown.  Yeah, you fucking hate that stuff.  All right, there's gonna be the wake on these three days, and, and there's fucking, uh, viewing.  Yeah.  From two to four, from fucking seven to eight, from ten to five.  It's like a comic doing sets.  Yeah, yeah, he's doing fucking spots.  And then he tore him around, and that's days that you gotta spend sitting there.  Well, in between, you go to a relative's house and take a bite off the big sandwich. 
[03:45:00]  We're gonna eat.  Did you bring food?  If you need anything, just call.  What am I gonna need?  All right, I need fucking Dr. Frankenstein to bring him back to life.  Can you fucking do that?  No.  Then you can't do anything for me.  But at least those things, they're not so morbid.  Like, you know, you go, you eat, you drink.  Like, that's one of those things where it's acceptable.  The Irish, the Irish do it right.  Yeah.  The Irish know that it's just fucking drinking and then fighting with each other.  Throw the dead body right on the pool table at the, uh, watering hole, right?  Yep.  Here's what you should do. 
[03:45:30]  You want to pay your respects.  Yeah.  You should tip the coffin over it.  And when the person rolls out, everybody just yells at us.  I had things to do today.  You just yell whatever you want it to get off your chest.  They're dead.  They don't care.  You gotta exercise your anger.  Say whatever you need to say.  I kick it over the coffin.  You knock it over angrily.  The nerve of you to die on Father's Day.  Is that where any day, whatever the issue with Christmas, hey, selfish, the game's on. 
[03:46:00]  How am I supposed to enjoy all these presents?  Exactly.  Exactly.  Now I can't think of Santa Claus ho, ho, ho, and I gotta think of you trying to say something  and being unable to.  What did you want, Nana?  Nana.  Nana, what did you want?  You had fucking 60 years to say it.  You didn't say it.  Kick it over.  Kick it over and just holler at her.  Oh, bitch, shut up.  Or just kick it over, grab a hair, and start smashing her head on the floor and go, don't  worry, people, it doesn't hurt her now. 
[03:46:30]  And then you realize you have the wrong lady, and you've grabbed the one that's alive, and  then you have to fucking laugh it off and play a bloopers reel.  Here's a funeral's bloopers reel.  Here's Aunt Helen getting her cunt kicks.  It's like that bit when Alan Funt died.  Candid camera.  He loved the Alan Funt bit.  That was so funny.  But I just thought the whole speeches that they give are just so phony and terrible. 
[03:47:00]  It's just like, look, the guy's life wasn't fantastic.  My grandfather, his wife died young.  His twin brother died young.  He was the last of all his peoples that he hung with.  Why don't you just be honest and say, look, it was about time the guy was miserable.  Who made the phoniest speech, could you say?  Or could you say what was said in the phoniest speech?  Well, just like, I mean, I know how, like, the rabbi that's doing the service, he doesn't  know how the guy lived.  Like, I had to spend a few months at that apartment. 
[03:47:30]  It was fucking disgusting.  Really?  Which is filth.  Yeah.  Fucking.  I don't have breathing problems.  I had breathing problems there from all the fucking roach shit.  Uh-oh.  Ew.  That's how bad it was.  How many roaches?  Thousands.  Hundreds of thousands.  You saw roaches?  Some.  There were so many roaches, they didn't go away in the daytime.  Get the fuck out of here.  Daytime roaches.  Wow.  Get the fuck out of here.  Where were they?  Like, were they in the couch and stuff?  They were everywhere.  So they had to be crawling on the guy?  Everywhere.  One time, like I said, I had to live there for a few months, and I woke up in the middle 
[03:48:00]  of the night, and I was thirsty.  I wanted to get something to drink.  So I go into the kitchen, and I flick the light on, and he had, like, dark, like, fake  brick linoleum in the kitchen.  All right?  I love that.  So I flick the light on, and I know what the deal is, so I'm, like, looking around real  cautious, because I fucking hate bugs.  And I'm looking around, and I'm like, all right, I think this is okay.  And I put one foot step on that linoleum, and it looked like Mr. Pratt's apartment.  It was just, it was just, there was just a wave that went like this. 
[03:48:30]  What's the matter, Mr. Pratt?  And I was like, Boat's got your tongue?  That's how it was.  It was the end of Creepshow, and I was just like, you know what?  I'm not that thirsty.  Fucking turned the light back off, went back to bed.  I was like, fuck this.  Why did you stay there?  I had to.  I had no place.  It was one of those times when, like, you just, again, nowhere to go.  Wait, where, but were the cockroaches in your room?  Of course, they had to be.  I mean, I didn't see, I mean, I did, I did, I did see them, you know, but I mean,  I'm sure that when I was sleeping, they would just, they had to be everywhere.  Right, right.  They had to be everywhere.  How did you not sleep with the light on and just put a sleeping mask on?  Oh, dude, I spent so much time out of that place, as much as I could. 
[03:49:00]  Like, if I wasn't working, I was trying to hang out with friends.  Like, I would try to only stay there to, like, sleep briefly and then get the fuck out in the morning.  Were they in the cupboards and all that?  Everywhere.  I never used any plates.  I never used any.  You really just saw them out and about?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I never used any silverware.  Like, that whole getting a drink of water story, I didn't use one of his glasses.  I had a fucking Snapple bottle that I would wash out every day because I did not want  to use anything where something could crawl inside of it.  When I was done with that Snapple bottle, I would put a fucking top on it. 
[03:49:30]  I'd rather live on the street.  I'd rather live on the street.  Dude, it sucked.  I might as well have.  It was so terrible.  Yeah.  It really was terrible.  Find a bridge and live under it or something.  That's what I'm saying.  So, don't at the guy's fucking funeral speech.  Just say how.  Oh, he was always such a, you know, he was such a happy guy and he had a great life.  It's like, he lived without his wife in that apartment for like 15 years and just miserable  social security.  Who's cleaning out the apartment?  Actually, I think my uncle, he's a carpenter, so I think he's going to try and gut it and 
[03:50:00]  clean it up.  But why didn't you do that when the guy was alive?  Yeah.  Exactly.  No one thinks that way.  You know what I'm saying?  We all think.  Tell me how much you love me now instead of saying it in front of my dead body when I  have no idea.  I love you, Danny.  Danny.  Thank you.  And if I had a Ouija board thing in front of me, I would just go, I-H-A-T-E-N-I.  Who's Nicky?  Wow.  Can you imagine doing that?  Why don't you like night crawlers? 
[03:50:30]  Exactly.  They scare me.  Wow.  They scare me, the night crawlers.  Why don't you like Nissan?  I don't like that either.  It's a foreign car company.  I'm an American car guy.  Oh, I see.  Yes.  So that sounds like it was a drag.  It really was.  Did you have-  And before I get the email from my mother, will you just let me say things?  Yeah.  Can I have opinions, please?  And why don't you get along-  Before I get a nasty phone call from you later.  Why don't you get along with your mom?  Huh?  Why don't you get along with your mom?  She's just a fucking twat. 
[03:51:00]  Why?  She just is.  We had this talk on the-  If you were listening to The Secret Show-  Yes.  You would have heard all about my mother.  But it was The Secret, so not many people listened.  Hey!  People listened to The Secret Show.  Not many.  Got a lot of fans of The Secret Show.  Not many.  I was tricking up.  Could there be another Secret Show in the future?  I say The Secret.  She did a lot of very selfish things when I was growing up.  And I don't feel close to her.  That's why if I don't talk to her ever again, I'll never feel anything. 
[03:51:30]  Because it doesn't matter to me whatsoever.  This is C. Montgomery Burns, and you're frittering away your morning.  All your life.  Listening to Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  All right, let me unzip.  Now I'm here.  There he is.  Oh, look at you.  Hey.  Look at you.  I didn't know that.  Louis Black.  That's so good. 
[03:52:00]  Thank you.  I hope you bought a couple copies.  Stop being selfish.  Oh, no.  Oh, good.  No, we all got a book.  We got four books.  I knew you were going to be here.  I wanted a book.  Where's my book?  Louis Black in studio.  We were just reading the quotes from Stuart, Stephen King, and George Carlin, my friend.  Yeah.  And I want to read the George Carlin one again.  Whenever I'm asked, who makes you laugh, or who would you pay to see, I don't hesitate  for a moment.  Louis Black, period.  He's got it all.  Brains, balls, and chops. 
[03:52:30]  Look at that.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show, sir.  Yeah, you can print anything you fucking want on the back.  Yeah, it doesn't matter.  You can attribute it to people that never said anything.  Yeah.  We're now going to do a highbrow interview with Louis Black.  Thank you.  You want to give me a quote from my book when I do it?  You know I'll give you a quote.  I didn't know that.  Thank you.  Don't yell at him.  I know.  What are you doing, Louis?  What do you mean, what is this, quiet time today?  I'll come in.  I have to drink 12 cups of coffee to get ready, figuring you guys have already done five hours  of radio.  It's quiet time.  Louis, don't drink the coffee. 
[03:53:00]  Drink the five-hour energy that we have outside the studio.  Thanks for the segue here.  Nice plug.  Yeah.  I don't know.  It gets you going.  I'm not reading all this crap about vitamins and stuff.  Yeah, it does.  Did this come out today?  This is the first.  You have a signing, my friend.  I believe.  Yes, I have a signing.  Louis got fucked the first book he did because it was destined to be a bestseller.  Oh, oh, oh.  That was how you got the deal.  Okay, I thought, yeah, I misunderstood. 
[03:53:30]  You should write a book that is titled Louis Got Fucked because I would love to read that.  Take my Simon and Schuster.  His first book was destined to be a bestseller.  It was a bestselling book, and the fucking pulp died, and these pulp books came out.  And fucking knocked Louis off the list.  I was ready to say, how do you get knocked off the list?  I'm thinking, what, did all the Harry Potter books get re-released?  Three pulp books.  You don't compete with Harry Potter because it's non-fiction and fiction.  Oh, I got you.  But the pulp books were all non-fiction. 
[03:54:00]  Or fiction, if you want to go in that direction.  So what was it?  It was pulp books up and down the chart, right?  He got fucked.  Unbelievable.  Oh, Louis.  So fucking help Louis, man.  He's a brilliant writer.  The book, uh...  But seriously, like, buy it now.  You're going to buy it.  Don't be shit-dicks and wait for the paperback.  It's not that fucking heavy.  What's this about, man?  I'm really happy that you're running a book.  It's a book about religion.  Louis, what's wrong?  It's a career-ender.  Why?  What do you mean, why?  Oh, because you can't talk about the Jews.  You can't talk about anything.  Any religion.  You can't talk about any religion whatsoever. 
[03:54:30]  What were you thinking?  Do you have...  I just figured I wanted it over.  Yeah, people look it up.  Boy, screw it.  You know, you're going to just retire.  Right.  And this way, they kind of go, get out of here.  Dude, I...  Go away.  I'm like the funny Solomon Rushdie.  Yeah.  I'm going to...  He's also got a book coming out this week.  I'm absolutely going to read this.  So you wrote a book on religion, so I...  Yeah, but I wrote a book on my...  It's not like one of those...  Everybody wrote, you know, you can...  There's about 500 books that came out in the last year.  They either bash religion, you know. 
[03:55:00]  They go through bashing organized religion.  Well, I mean, I kind of...  It didn't make sense to go do that again.  And it didn't make sense to say that I'd actually found God, because that's a lie.  There's a billion books on that.  But this is a book on basically my experience with anything that has to do with...  With religion.  Religion.  Organized religion.  So, like, they go, why don't you...  People...  Why don't you write about Scientology?  Because I've never...  You know what?  I never met...  The only one I know is Tom Cruise.  No, because you want to make movies still. 
[03:55:30]  Huh?  You want to make movies still.  We understand.  And, you know, they have their own, like, hit squad.  Yeah, we understand, Lewis.  We send people out.  Well, except at the show, that Root of All Evil, we're going to do Scientology versus...  Yeah.  ...versus Disney.  Right.  And it's already...  The legal department's already going, no, you can't do that.  No, you can't do that.  No, you can't.  It's like...  Legal department for what?  For Comedy Central, because we're going after Scientology.  You know, it's Scientology versus Disney.  Right.  Oh, we're in the show?  Versus Disney.  Oh, yeah, of course.  That would be hilarious, by the way, to watch. 
[03:56:00]  That would be hilarious.  What's the problem?  That Disney has more reality-based stuff in it?  Get out of here, y'all.  He getting political.  Oh, shit.  Woo!  I'm talking Jimmy.  It's pretty amazing.  This is great, dude.  It's like every...  I'm sorry to interrupt you.  Every fucking chapter is just like a two-page boom, boom.  It's like a real...  I love books like that.  I don't mean easy reading in a bad way.  He knows his audience.  It's like there's no pressure to fucking blather through it.  Stuff like this.  If you've got a good log working, you fuck it on the ball, you pick it up, it's two pages. 
[03:56:30]  That's it.  So this is good log reading.  I go in, unload lunch, get my Lewis, I'm done.  The bottom of the book is even bent, so you can rest it on your knees.  Jimmy makes a good point, though.  You pick up a book, and you're like, you know what?  I'm going to read one more chapter, and you've got the OCD working, and it's like, you look  ahead, you're like, 25 fucking more pages before I can put this book down.  This is two, three pages of chapters.  It's perfect.  It's been the secret to my success.  It's perfect.  It's as far as I can think.  I think that's about it, and then I go, oh, I'm tired. 
[03:57:00]  Right.  That's enough.  Let's wrap it up.  I'm just the opposite.  I'm long-winded, and every chapter drones on and on.  No, you're like, no.  No, but I'm doing something else, not for now, for a while from now, and it's like, fuck,  I'm just writing these chapters.  It's like, what are you writing?  I don't want to say, because it's your book day.  It's not mine.  Who cares?  Fuck me.  I don't have time to whore myself.  I want to know about your pain.  No, Jimmy's got a...  Well, as of now, it's a book about religion as well.  And he's not scared to take on Scientology.  The government calls it a manifesto. 
[03:57:30]  Right.  No, his idea is really good.  I think Jimmy's going to have a hit on his hand.  Now, I don't want to blow up your spot, but one of these chapters, death is the ultimate  game show.  Yeah.  I know you want people to read the book, but that's...  I've got to ask you.  You know.  What is that about?  It's, you know, you basically, it's which door you're going to pick.  You know, do you want to go through it?  Oh, shit.  That's a brilliant idea.  Which is, you know, it's which religion is the one that gets you to there.  Ah.  The amazing thing about the Jews is we have no hell. 
[03:58:00]  And we have no heaven.  I don't know where we go.  I think Jews' hell is here on earth because you're just made to suffer.  That's what it is.  Jews insist on just suffering here on this plane of existence.  I don't know.  I mean, with the Reformed Jews that I was a Reformed Jew, which was essentially, let's  try to look like we're really a part of the culture so they don't shoot us tomorrow.  Let's just try to make the transition.  We'll transition our kids this way.  And the thing is, is that I have no clue. 
[03:58:30]  I really don't.  I still don't.  I don't have no clue.  I don't understand the Jewish faith because if there's no heaven and no hell, why bother?  Like, they got you with the Catholic religion.  Like, oh, shit, man.  I don't want darkness for the rest of eternity.  So if they're telling me it's heaven, all right, I'm going to, like, deal with this stuff.  And Catholics, they keep us in line with guilt.  He's dead.  Your fault.  Right.  Wow.  Right.  Well, they keep us in line with guilt.  The Jews are, yeah, ahead of the line with the guilt thing.  But what's the point being Jewish then?  Well, apparently there's, the thing is, there's a messianic age. 
[03:59:00]  What?  You know, like a messiah.  Oh, messiah.  Or a very messy age.  A messianic age.  And, but I still, but I don't know what that is.  I don't know.  It sounds like a new mall is what it sounds like.  Yeah.  A better mall.  It'll be a better mall.  Right.  You know, because part of it, I mean, I think the Orthodox end of it, they kind of believe,  you know, that he hasn't come back yet.  So there's still, people still waiting around, which is really good. 
[03:59:30]  There's a good concept.  Just what a way to spend life, just waiting for some magical zombie to come back and, what,  fix everything for you?  Yeah, that's it.  Make things better, give you the promise of eternal life and blah, blah, blah.  Well, I mean, you know, but that's always been the thing that they said about the Catholic  Church was, you know, the way that they, they sold themselves throughout, throughout  the world was, you know, these people are living in misery.  They're going, you know, when you, when this is done, you know, you're going to get the  sneakers.  Maybe, Ben.  You don't have to make them. 
[04:00:00]  You're going to get them.  Wait till you see the mall that's coming.  Can I correct myself before I make a total ass?  Lewis hit the bestseller list, but it was the printed list that he missed.  So he did actually hit the New York Times bestseller list, but he would have been on  the fucking printed list, which means he would have seen it in the map.  But he actually is a bestselling author.  So that was my error to imply that he wasn't.  But it says it right on the front.  Well, that's why you think I would, I was holding the book.  He's a bestselling author.  This is what a piece of shit I am.  I was holding the book while I said that.  Right?  I'm such a retard.  I was looking at Lou's picture.  It's my friend. 
[04:00:30]  Instead of reading it.  It says it right there, right under his name.  It's in black.  You can't see it.  Yeah, well, he's a little shy.  He doesn't want to brag.  He wants it there.  He doesn't want it to stand out.  It's classy.  How did you get fucking Stephen King to write on your book?  Yeah, we want him on our show.  That was pretty wild.  We want him on our show.  Did you ask him?  No.  They just took it from, they took a quote from something he said in Entertainment  Weekend.  Oh, is that how they worked these quotes?  And they probably had to ask.  What if they just Google your name and go, well, in a 20-page article, they had one line  on you.  We'll use that.  No, it was actually him. 
[04:01:00]  I guess they must have.  I don't know how they do it.  They didn't.  But the great thing about, you know what the great thing about that cover is?  The great thing about the book jacket is I know one of his, we worked with this  guy on this pilot for the History Channel that was like the kind of PG version of  Penn and Teller's bullshit.  Okay.  And so we did one pilot.  And the guy who did the graphics and all of the visual stuff for that is phenomenal.  And it turns out, he's the guy, so I got to know him, he's the guy who did the Abbey 
[04:01:30]  Road cover.  He did like Blind Faith.  He did like all the great covers, late 60s, early 70s.  And he talked to him and said, what was it like?  And he goes, I don't remember anything.  I remember nothing.  He said, I do know it was great.  Right.  I just have a feeling it was great, but I don't really know.  I don't remember.  It was when they actually used to give out Grammys for album covers.  Sure.  Yeah.  Everybody's talking about your show, too, by the way.  Yeah.  You're talking about Comedy Central's show, man. 
[04:02:00]  Yeah.  So far, so good, I guess.  So far, great.  So far, really good.  The ratings are good.  Well, tell Comedy Central, because they're constantly, you know, they're, what are we  getting, you know, you get on the phone.  Look, as long as the Pope's alive, you'll be fine.  They're just getting nervous.  That's all.  That's what they do.  Well, they're crazy.  They don't like you making fun of women at Comedy Central.  Learn that one quickly.  Here's the one we want to do, which I think you guys will appreciate.  So we're arguing for, because we want the guys working the show to be able to pick  what they, you know, want to do and what they're, you know, really give a shit about. 
[04:02:30]  Well, I guess not being good, just because you've got to explain the concept of the show  for maybe people that haven't heard or seen it yet there.  The show is, it's essentially, we pick two topics.  The topics are like NRA versus PETA.  That's one we're getting coming up.  And one comic takes on one and says, well, that's more evil.  The other comic says, well, PETA's more evil. 
[04:03:00]  I then decide I'm the judge.  And so what we wanted to do was, you know, marriage versus death.  Okay, now I think that's a solid.  All right.  That's, it's A, it's comics can do that great.  Sure.  So what is the argument?  Marriage, there's, you know, there's just so much stuff you could say about marriage.  Really?  So much funny stuff.  Let's not do that.  Let's find something that's difficult. 
[04:03:30]  And the other thing that, this was the most extraordinary quote, death.  Why not death?  Why can't we use death for anything?  Well, you know, I don't think death is really evil.  You don't think death is evil.  There he is.  Now we can properly welcome Louis Black to the show.  There you go.  You don't think death is, I mean, who doesn't think it's evil?  Unless you're a suicide case.  Unless you're really, you're a massive antidepressant.  Antidepressants, you know. 
[04:04:00]  Who's telling you what you can't do?  You know what you're doing.  They have to approve the topics?  Of course they do.  Okay.  You know the deal.  Yeah, but.  You want to do something.  This is like, you know, here we can sit around and talk.  You go on stage.  That's why I like going, I prefer stage.  Here's my nomination for what you ought to do.  Shit chewing or pedophilia?  Of course.  It's time.  Hat wearing or rape?  Of course.  This is a no brainer.  Of course death is evil.  Of course it is.  But it's just, so you have to sit there and go, you know, and you listen and there's 
[04:04:30]  a speakerphone and they're talking to you and I'm like, and I sit there the whole time  going with my hands around, like pretending I'm choking something.  Sure.  And then there are other people who talk to them because I can't talk to them.  That's interesting, right?  Well, the good, the one thing I learned from it is why, you know, everybody goes, gee, why  did it take your career so long?  Because, you know what?  I couldn't deal with these fucks.  That's what took so long.  Well, you still can't.  You just learn to put other people in the way.  Exactly.  Yeah.  No, I just shut up. 
[04:05:00]  We did a pilot for Comedy Central that'll never see the light of day.  Never.  But we had a conversation about the women because they liked one of our bits where a girl rolls  around.  She's got honey and rolls around in money.  Okay.  That makes sense.  And that works for me for this show.  And they loved the bit, but then it got to the lawyers or practices over there and they're  like, eh, that doesn't make women look good and stuff.  It's degrading.  And then they decided. 
[04:05:30]  You're kidding, right?  No.  They're like, eh.  That doesn't make women look good?  No.  Degrading.  Degrading to women and stuff.  Did they watch the man show?  Yeah.  And then they decided.  Did they ever watch their own show?  Then they decided it would be okay if we had a guy do it first.  And we're like, ew.  Why?  Get a guy in honey and have him all around in money.  If you do the guy, do it first.  And then you could do the hot girl doing the same thing.  It's like, ugh.  Why don't you just.  Oh, my God.  Instead of that, why don't you just say, let's go to black for like three minutes and then 
[04:06:00]  have the girl.  Yeah, exactly.  So when they get to the channel, instead of having them waste the time watching that,  they could just skip that.  I mean, you could maybe make fat guy honey rolling around.  Maybe you could kind of make it funny, but that's not the point.  We wanted to bring some hotness to this project.  And I was just like.  That's kind of mean, though.  Let's go with the fat guy, because that's kind of funny.  Yeah.  It was just like, make sure he's white.  And that guy needs to be white.  And at that moment, I was lucky enough to know what you guys have been going through 
[04:06:30]  for your entire careers.  I'm like, you know what?  This radio thing isn't that bad after all.  Do you understand?  That is why.  That mentality.  Because it's frustrating.  If we get on regular radio, we still could do that type of thing without having to ask  anybody.  Yeah.  That mentality is why I kill the left so hard.  It's not about any particular network, but it's that.  Well, that's kind of mean to women.  Let's do a guy first.  It's that fucking, that soft, fucking awful thinking. 
[04:07:00]  That's not left or right.  That's fucking television.  That's a fucking group of people.  It's not.  It's a group.  It's a committee.  It's corporate fuck think.  That's more.  I'll tell you one thing.  Corporate fuck think.  Yes.  God damn.  I need a shirt.  No, because they're not corporate people making those decisions.  There are people out of college a few years.  There are people who like, if you attack the ideology of the left, they give you more  shit.  Like, I bet you when you want to go after the church, nobody had a problem with it.  No, no, they didn't.  No, a huge problem.  Huge.  And no one understands.  I mean, it's the same as Scientology.  And no one understands.  What's nuts is they're equating Scientology with the Catholic Church. 
[04:07:30]  I mean, that's what's completely crazy.  No one amazes me, too, is that these guys don't understand how easy it is to fix TV.  Most people will agree, most TV sucks dick.  Yes.  You hire Lewis Black and Norton and Adam Farrar or whatever, and let them fucking do their  thing.  It's that easy.  Well, it's HBO.  They make such an easy concept so complicated, where you're now out of your realm of what you  can do.  You're like, I don't want to make, you know, the wall sound evil.  I want to talk about death being evil. 
[04:08:00]  Well, it'd be like, you know, it's like if any of us hired any of us to do anything.  The thing is, is I've hired, you know, if I hired Jim and I said, you know, I need you  to do 20 minutes on my TV show.  So would I ever ask him what 20 minutes?  Would I ever give you shit?  No.  I need 20 minutes.  Okay.  And you do it.  Get your best 20 minutes.  You know, but like, and that's the, but they never, it's always like, can I help you?  But the more I talk to you guys, it's like the really good stuff is left out of the shows. 
[04:08:30]  It's like, come on.  That's the stuff people want to see.  Well, I told you we did that.  This, we talked about this a long time.  I did this thing called Red State Diaries with Stilson.  Jeff Stilson.  He's funny, man.  He's producing it.  And, and Stilson's the guy who produced, uh, uh, the Ozzy Osbourne show.  Okay.  So he's the one who edited that story together.  So we're down in Florida doing this shoot and we do the thing and we finish it and they  test it and it tests great.  And it's just me wandering around trying to figure out what's the difference between a  red state and a blue state. 
[04:09:00]  And most of the time I go like the first show, it's like this red state shit is great.  You know, I'm like getting drunk with guys at a, at a tailgate party eating alligator and  it was phenomenal.  And I'm screaming and there's four people from Comedy Central outside the trailer and I'm  screaming at the fact that, that they don't know what the fuck fun is.  You have no clues to what fun is.  You lead your miserable lives.  You go to the Hamptons.  Okay.  I'm here in, in, in 500 degree humidity, you know, drunk on tequila eating alligator.  And this is more fun than I've ever had in my life with you people. 
[04:09:30]  So they, so we do it.  And then they say at the end, it tested really well.  And then they go, well, you know, the problem with the show is Lewis doesn't yell enough.  Well, that's, that's why I'm funny.  Yeah.  I mean, I'll grant you I'm funny cause I yell.  I mean, certainly that's part of it, but that you can't say.  They want yelling.  Lewis doesn't yell.  They want yelling Lewis.  Great.  And I said, well, I'm talking, cause I'm walking around talking to these people, you know,  who are, you know, it's all, it's all sorts. 
[04:10:00]  I'm like talking to, uh, these, uh, like, uh, people who do all sorts of crap there and,  you know, pay self football crap.  And it was all about like football weekend at Florida state.  Uh, you can't be screaming at the people you're, you know, how do you get video you idiot?  Yeah.  Exactly.  What do they want you to be an asshole in the middle of the parking lot?  Give me some alligator.  You're just being you.  What the fuck's wrong with them?  Pucking his fingers at the eyes.  Yeah.  The easy crocodile.  Right. 
[04:10:30]  You call this tequila?  Right.  Where's the beer funnel?  It's my turn.  And boy, were they drunk there.  And what did we need?  We had footage of guys who liked it.  Literally, we had two guys who, uh, just, you know, uh, when we were filming, who just  kind of were walking along and had a beer bottle and smashed it up in their own head.  Right.  What do I need to yell at anybody?  Exactly.  It's a great visual.  It's a great visual.  And, uh, they were like, no, that's just not going to work for us.  That sucks. 
[04:11:00]  So getting back to the book, Me of Little Faith.  Now, obviously for the book, you studied a lot of religions, right, Lewis?  Not really?  Just, just your, just what you, it was truly, if I, when I talk about Catholicism, first  off, all of my friends who are Catholics, who are comics, do all of that stuff better  than I'm going to do.  I'm Jewish.  So they've experienced it all.  So what I wrote about was my friend and I, who was a Catholic that I went to, uh, to  school with would have these arguments all the time. 
[04:11:30]  So I wrote about the arguments we had instead of going, you know, I don't, I don't need  to, to top, you know, the stuff you guys do.  I don't need, what do I need to, to do the molestation bits that you guys were on the  West.  You guys were all that.  All right.  Lewis, you're Jewish.  The Jews controlling the media.  True or no?  True or no?  Is there a chapter on your secret meetings?  Yeah, but we have the, well actually during Passover, the thing, the great thing was is 
[04:12:00]  the, you know, there's that Hebrew on the front and that's how we pass the messages to  each other.  That's it.  They're writing backwards.  That's how they do it.  Lewis, what's your favorite religion?  My favorite religion?  Just from what you observed over the years.  Amish.  I love the Amish because they stay to themselves, they do it, they make, they, they, they have,  they have great chicken, their chicken is spectacular, and they make a, and, and basically they do 
[04:12:30]  what they do and they believe in what they believe in and they go, this is what we're  doing.  Got it?  They don't bother you with it.  They don't irritate you with it.  And their kids occasionally come into your neighborhood and sell you some blow.  Right.  Okay?  They do fuck up traffic though with the horses.  They do if, when was the last time you were in fucking Lancaster?  Lancaster.  They have that thing.  They've been buzzing around, they do have a little stuff.  I have a book out, I still got to work the road.  And Lewis, they had that thing, Rum Stella, right? 
[04:13:00]  It's called?  Me and Jimmy were talking about this on the way home one day.  It's like, they allow their kids to be hoars for like a period of time.  A couple years.  It's not a couple years, is it?  Yeah, it can be, sure.  You can do it as long as you want.  As long as you want.  Who the fuck would go back to the Amish lifestyle?  A lot of them do.  I know.  They do probably because, you know.  Basically, if you don't know what that is, they leave the family and they go and they  whore it up, basically.  Drink, have sex, drive cars, use machinery.  Falking.  Socking.  Socking.  Eating.  Drinking.  They buy iPods. 
[04:13:30]  They buy iPods.  And then they give all that up to go back to this lame, in my eyes, life.  You know, but that shows you.  You know, I think that at least they, you know, they, to me, they do everything right and they  don't bother us.  They don't.  They don't, you know, you don't, you know, you don't got somebody coming on your, hey,  you want to be, come down to the farm, you want to use buttons instead of a zipper.  I think half that says, they don't bother us.  I don't know what, if they do it as right.  They just don't bother us.  They don't bother us.  Yeah.  There's no need to convert us.  Now, you said they sometimes go into your neighborhood and sell you a Coke. 
[04:14:00]  Well, that was the kids.  Do you have an experience?  No, no, but you remember the kids.  That was that.  It was a big blow up for a while.  Because there's some of the kids who were there, who were out doing that, whatever you  call it, rum sticking.  Rum sticking something, yeah.  It probably means molasses in their dumb language.  Fucking central Pennsylvania idiots.  We really should just slaughter them.  I mean, I got to backtrack.  Just take the fucking land.  Yeah, we do our own butter.  You fucking assholes.  Make some assholes as far as I'm concerned. 
[04:14:30]  Just go in there with a fucking, with a machine gun and a few hammers and just take their fucking  barns and put up jerk-off shacks.  Churn, churn, churn.  Yeah, exactly.  Fat women with fucking dumb hats.  Getting feedback.  Jerk-off shacks.  Getting feedback on the segment.  Someone's writing, Lewis, this interview isn't very funny.  Could you yell a little more?  No, I don't see that.  Fuck.  Fuck.  What's the worst religion, you think?  We all know it.  Say it, Lewis.  Well, is he going to go with Muslim?  I don't know.  Of course he is.  What's the worst religion you've experienced or have an observation on? 
[04:15:00]  I, I, that I've experienced is, uh, that I've experienced is, uh, fuck.  The fuck religion?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I mean, because what I just, seriously, what I just learned about, what I just, we've just  been going over Scientology, which I hadn't really done because I had no, I didn't know,  so now we're sitting around discussing it for the show last week.  Yeah.  And they are nuts.  They're, they're, they're, they're, they're completely from planet Xenu.  Right.  Yeah. 
[04:15:30]  Yeah.  Though, I'd never read the history.  Have you read the history?  It's a ridiculous science fiction story that is based in, in, yeah, he's a science fiction  writer.  He was, came up with this cockamamie story and people are buying it as a religion when, you  know, with a story like that, you need a couple of thousand years to really have it pick  up steam.  You can't have, you know.  And there's gotta be cool stuff.  Look, I'd have got my problems with the Catholic religion, but my guy walked on water, you know?  I mean, there's some cool things that happened.  No, these, these guys got spaceships and aliens and all kinds of fun stuff. 
[04:16:00]  Well, the thing is, is it makes the, what the, you know, the Mormon thing, which is  also mildly insane.  Mm-hmm.  Establishment.  Oh, yeah.  It makes them look normal.  They almost look normal.  They've got you.  They bring Jesus in.  Christ took a swim over here at some point and hung out in North America.  They bring these souls down here.  They put him in a, uh, uh, volcano.  That was the deal.  And then out of the volcano.  I mean, you just go on and he goes on.  Well, let's cut to the chase here.  Let's give it a fucking brass tacks.  All right.  The Mormons and the Scientologists, they don't put bombs on their chest. 
[04:16:30]  They don't run at the movie theaters.  We all know who the fucking, the harshest ones are.  Let's come on.  They don't hijack planes.  I mean, they're fucking, you know, they might be kind of dicks.  You can't wait a sec.  You can't be pleased.  Most of the people who do that, you can't fucking, you know, let Jimmy have his moment.  No, he knows I'm right, though, because they're all of the same religion, the ones that do it.  Then where's the outrage from the Muslim community when it does happen?  It's in a ton of places.  You never hear them.  Well, here's why you don't hear it, for fuck's sake. 
[04:17:00]  Why don't you hear it?  Because we don't even hear about the war.  Where's the war?  Page 57.  No.  It's not even in the paper, usually.  Yeah, it's not.  Well, now it's down to 3%.  Yeah.  They don't, what are they going to put?  Big news, Islams think this sucks?  Do you think so?  Come on.  Oh, boy.  The moohaha, who most of us don't pay any attention to, is going to show up on TV and we're going  to go, gee, I've got to get that channel.  Who's, uh, who's, uh, but who's, uh, who's the only ones keeping slaves? 
[04:17:30]  Please, wait a minute.  Slave me right now in the Sudan.  The, uh, uh, all the, uh.  You're right.  It's just, it's the Muslims.  They are right now.  No, there's a group of people who happen to be Muslim, the same way there was a group  of fucking Catholics who were psychotic for a while, the same way there were a group of  fucking Jews who were crazy at some time during the planet.  Right, yeah.  There's a group of them, Jimmy.  Yes, a billion.  It's not a whole fucking religion.  But it's a lot.  It's not, of course it's not.  It's a very small percentage comparatively.  But there are a lot that are doing it. 
[04:18:00]  I'm not saying that they're, like, uh, every Muslim.  You, you, you take any group right now, they are the ones who are stirring the pot up more  than anybody.  And that is why my chapter on Islam is very short.  Why?  Because I don't want them, even to sell the book, I don't want to go into hiding.  Yeah.  You see?  Exactly.  Oh, sure.  We all know you can shit on Mormons and Catholics and others, and you may get shit for it.  Oh, I will get it.  But you're not going to have some, you're not going to have to worry about your life.  And let's be very frank, that's why people are very hesitant to make fun of, or make 
[04:18:30]  fun of, because I'm not going to give, make fun of them, but to truly trash them.  Well, when you kind of, when you do a cartoon and then they come after you.  You know how long it would take to saw through Lewis's neck?  That, to me, is the fucking...  You know how long it would take to saw through your neck?  30 seconds.  And Lewis does not have a tough neck consistency.  That's all good liver and filet mignon.  Come on.  It's like a veal.  I have to go back.  Islam.  Islam.  It's Islam.  I know.  Islam.  All I'm saying is, I got nothing to say. 
[04:19:00]  He's not kidding.  The chapter is...  It's two paragraphs.  It looks like three paragraphs, but one of the paragraphs is one sentence.  So it's two paragraphs.  He just made the font on Islam.  It is.  That's it.  I'm not going to deal with it.  You ain't messing with that.  Okay, but that's...  To me, that answers the question.  It's like, I mean...  You know, the bottom line is, there, of course, is a lot of Muslims that aren't violent.  But you know what?  There's a lot that are, and people are afraid to even tease them. 
[04:19:30]  And in the New York papers, they wouldn't even show that cartoon that they would show.  You imagine, if it was a cartoon about Christ or anybody, they would have printed it.  But because it depicted Mohammed and they were afraid of violence, not afraid of protesters  or advertising boycotts, they were afraid of violence.  So they wouldn't print it.  And that's not in the Middle East.  That's not a handful of crooks.  That's here in the United States.  They were afraid of violence from a religious group by simply showing the image that had  been deemed offensive.  Sorry.  Jesus.  Way to take the funny out, Jim.  Now we're all bummed out, man. 
[04:20:00]  He was all serious.  Call Louie back.  Yeah.  So we can talk about his dead dog for another half hour before he missed.  Give us some joy.  So, Hillary, Obama, McCain, where are we at?  He's McCain.  No, I know all that, but where are we at in general?  I mean, I'm done.  You're just done with the whole process?  I can't hear what any of them are saying anymore.  I've reached...  I'm deaf.  I don't like any of them.  I'm deaf.  I don't like any of them.  And I can't hear the president.  I can't hear any of them.  I can't really look at them.  Who?  The president. 
[04:20:30]  Where has he been?  But I can't hear them.  I literally...  The worst was the worst.  And it's just the worst.  And this is where I think, where you see the psychotic of, like, the Democratic Party  is you watch...  Eight minutes, I watch Michigan or, you know, the debate over how they're going to see people,  you know, listening to those guys talk.  Unbelievable.  Unconscionable.  You're going, what is the matter with you? 
[04:21:00]  Well, you can't...  What?  What?  Six minutes I was watching, like, you know, their banter back and forth.  You just go, why didn't you...  Here, I can't stand the two main people you got.  Now you're showing me why I can't stand the entire party.  Who do you like...  What are you going for, though?  Is it Obama or Hillary?  Who do you feel?  I don't...  I seriously don't care.  I've reached the point...  I don't care.  They've killed me.  It's idiotic.  I find them both... 
[04:21:30]  There was so...  If you really had cared, if they had really cared, they went right, you know, to the beginning.  They kind of...  They both shot to the front.  Figure it out.  Cut the pie.  Do it like the mob does it.  You know?  Work it out.  That's right.  You will be president, and you will be a dyke ex-first lady.  And so will be the peace.  It ain't the way I wanted it.  I'm smart.  Jimmy, Weese agrees with that statement, right? 
[04:22:00]  Weese?  Ah.  No, he agrees with Obama and Hillary.  He's a big Hillary fan.  Is he really?  Weese is a big Hillary fan.  You want to come better than Obama?  Okay.  Weese has a picture of him and Hillary in his cottage.  I tell you what, I had to look at it as I was going to the shower last weekend.  A handshake.  I tell you, any type of connection does help get votes.  They are smart politicians.  That's why Obama was dumb to fucking let people see him being a dick to that guy in Philly  and to that fucking when he was ordering breakfast.  He's like, don't be cranky with the public, asshole, because we're easily affected.  Yeah.  But she... 
[04:22:30]  I don't really...  I'm stunned.  Is it a guarantee that McCain is the next president?  No.  No way.  No?  No way.  You don't think so?  No.  I think so because a lot of middle America...  Well, you still believe Yemen is the cause of...  I don't even think I was vindicated with Yemen.  Vindication.  It's still the most explicit.  It was vindication.  Yeah, I think there's too much middle America, regular, you know, guys down there and gals  that aren't as liberal thinking as the coasts.  We're a little spoiled, you know, being here in New York, being in L.A. 
[04:23:00]  But I'll tell you, there's a big, big group out there that is livid.  There's a big group between here and there.  You know how livid you have to be to elect a black president in this country?  Huh?  This country has to be livid.  Well, it's pretty livid.  And I mean really livid.  It's pretty livid.  I mean, I think you may be right in the sense of the underbelly that is...  Yeah, yeah.  ...that will pour in.  But there is also that whole other group of people who never in their lives thought that 
[04:23:30]  they would ever not be Republican, that it would ever get to this, and that that war  has made insane.  Yeah.  I mean, it's, you know...  I don't agree with that.  It's, it's, it's, it's not, you know, it's...  And you've got this madness of, I mean, it's, it's just not stopping.  It's just...  And that's the other thing.  I mean, you know, my problem with, with, with a lot of what's going on is, is that we've  got major problems right now.  Major fucking problems.  And none of them are dealing with the problems.  Nobody's dealing with any of the problems.  So for me to listen... 
[04:24:00]  Well, listen to what I'd do if I was...  I don't give a shit.  Right.  What's some of the problems, Lewis, in your mind?  Let's see.  The fact that the, we can't educate our children anymore.  We don't have to do that.  There's like, most cities, it's 45 to 50 percent of the kids are dropping out before they get  into high school, before they graduate high school.  That's, isn't that considered an emergency?  At some point, isn't that got to be dealt with?  How would that be dealt with?  Why?  I mean, why are they leaving school?  Well, they're leaving the school because it's irrelevant to their lives and because their families... 
[04:24:30]  Irrelevant to their lives.  School was irrelevant to my life.  In my day, too.  It's not something that's relevant to your life.  It's something you have to do to get a diploma to then move on to the next level in the game  of life.  Right.  I can't agree with people dropping out of school because they don't find it relevant.  Well, I'm not saying...  I don't know why they're dropping out of school, but when you have 50 percent, my point is  when you've got 50 percent of the kids dropping out of school, you've got a real problem that 
[04:25:00]  you have to deal with as a culture.  I think the parents got a problem that they have to deal with.  I don't think the government's got to step in and do anything.  Well, okay.  Then let us wait for the parents to do it so that we can achieve total chaos.  But how is the government going to help something like that?  I'm not saying that the government...  I don't care how the fuck it happens.  You get it?  You know?  I don't give a shit.  They've got to make it more.  I don't care.  But don't call it government.  It's...  We're it.  We're people.  We're the guys.  We're the guys. 
[04:25:30]  At some point, this has...  This shit's got to be dealt with.  Your fucking health insurance thing.  You know what we do with that?  Here's what we do with that.  You fucking piss me off sometimes.  Nice.  Because you go, government, government.  We're government.  That's right.  Okay?  We're people.  We either do it or we...  Let's go to a barn somewhere and have a jerk-off.  Okay?  But the fact is, you bring the troops home now, and where you send them to is health insurance places.  And what they do is they bivouac there. 
[04:26:00]  And they go up every day, and the guy's got a piece of paper in front and says,  Gee, should I pay $50,000 to give this guy an x-ray and give him a tube to put in his penis and do all that?  Do I do that?  And the army guy comes in and puts the gun on his head and goes, Sign it, you fuck!  And that's how we solve health insurance.  Hey, right on.  That's a heavy-handed approach, but I think it's good.  I like it.  That's heavy-handed, but I think it would work.  Anthony, these are desperate times.  I agree with Anthony.  I thought school was irrelevant when I was going, and they have to make it more fun or more relevant. 
[04:26:30]  It's like we always say.  The crap they teach here.  I remember taking a class on Russian history.  I don't want to know about Russia.  Well, it's like, you know, here's the deal.  I mean, it's like, you know, you've got, what's the world we're competing in?  We're competing in a world of, like, video games and a ton of other shit that's tech shit that's going on that's insane.  All right, I got it.  I think it's pretty easy to sucker kids into, you know.  Final exams on PS3s and Xboxes. 
[04:27:00]  Exactly.  Have them take their tests on that.  Yeah.  But the kids are going to be the future people we're going to pick from the run of the country.  We need some smart fucking people to take care of shit when I get old.  That's all I'm concerned about.  Everyone's been concerned about that.  And there's always been people that do educate themselves and go through the system.  Look at Obama.  A very well-educated man.  And as he was being brought up, I'm sure it wasn't the easiest thing for him, that's for sure.  But he made it through.  He was a successful guy. 
[04:27:30]  Look at him.  First viable black candidate for president on a major ticket.  So where's this problem?  I say if he can do it, then anybody can.  You know, I don't think we need, like you're saying, the people.  You're kind of giving me this it takes a village thing, which I really don't enjoy that much.  I'm not giving you it takes a village thing.  It's this socialist kind of thing.  No, that is not.  No?  No, it's called we're the neighborhood.  We're it. 
[04:28:00]  Yeah, but sometimes I don't like my neighbors.  I don't want to talk to them.  I don't want to give my neighbors my fucking money.  I don't want to give my neighbors my shit.  I want to go in my pool.  I want to have fun.  And I have lived in an apartment building where I knew nobody for five years.  Nobody.  And they don't even seem to live there.  And then I hear that there's a party and people are apparently getting fucked in my apartment building.  Am I ever invited?  No.  Okay.  But something seems to be going on somewhere.  You'd probably kill the sexual mood just yelling, why is she not fucking my balls? 
[04:28:30]  What's wrong with my dick?  I got breaking news.  Officials say Hillary Rodham Clinton will acknowledge tonight that Barack Obama has the delegates for the nomination.  Big deal.  She fucking should have nominated.  Fucking said that in January.  It's all over the news.  It's going to be done tonight.  Wow.  Officials say Clinton will admit tonight Obama has delegates for nomination.  It took her long.  What the fuck?  She should have been out a while ago.  Stop.  Well, why would she take all that continue to piss that money away?  Oh.  You know? 
[04:29:00]  Why not use it to buy some new clothes?  She put her own money in, so they probably figured a way where she can get some of that money back.  So she held out that money.  She started putting in a lot of her own money.  Can I put devil's advocate here?  Is it possible that this might not be?  Because to me, her and Obama going back and forth really hasn't hurt Obama.  Eh, the preachership, but there's really not a lot of bad stuff about him.  Is it possible that this was somehow a democratic strategy because now he only has to deal with McCain from now until November? 
[04:29:30]  Instead of all of this time having to deal with John McCain, who could chip away at that fucking golden boy image.  Because people get sick of him.  Like, all right, we've been looking at Obama since February.  We get it.  But now there's a shorter window for him and McCain to actually be head to head.  So now it's still a fresh feel.  I don't think Democrats have ever been that smart.  But I mean, well, I don't know.  I mean, if the party unity means something.  If they're like, we have a shot here, but they know we want to get a black man elected president or one of the two. 
[04:30:00]  But maybe it was a strategy to kind of just keep that infighting going.  Nothing really that harsh was being said.  It was all kind of bullshit.  There was nothing destructive except for Jeremiah Wright.  I don't think it was a strategy because I think she really wanted it.  I think you're right, too.  Oh, yeah, she did.  I said she's the only person I've ever seen on TV where you actually, when she speaks, ambition hits the screen.  You actually see visual ambition.  And it comes in a lot of pastels. 
[04:30:30]  Well, I think once she does drop out, then it gets ugly.  I think McCain and his people are going to have a lot of stuff, a lot of ammunition against Obama.  All they got to do, they know the nerves to hit with the American people, especially middle America.  They're going to bring up that preacher.  They're going to bring up any other affiliations that him and his wife have had over the years with anything that looks remotely militant and ultra black.  And that's what they're going to do. 
[04:31:00]  And it's going to scare the living shit out of Americans.  Yeah, but the other problem, you know, but the other thing that you know is there is that he's got Bush.  Yeah.  He can try to distance as much as they both have these giant albatrosses around their neck.  You know, Obama's got the Democratic Party, but let's just say that's it clear.  You know, that puts all of his problems together.  He's in the Democratic Party, and they've basically been worthless for eight years.  I mean, when everybody gets excited, I go, they did nothing. 
[04:31:30]  Yeah.  And then he's got Bush around his neck.  And the other night, you know, he had to, like, hide.  They, like, had to hide.  They were doing that big fundraiser, and he had to go hide.  You don't want the pictures of Bush next to you at this point.  Yeah, I mean, it's unbelievable.  Yeah.  It's just extraordinary.  It's an extraordinary.  It's like nothing I've ever seen, you know.  Yeah, Democrats seem to have a weird, and I'm typically never Democrat, but I want to see one in this time.  They seem to, like, really not be able just to get it together. 
[04:32:00]  They kind of have self-destruct, or they just turn on each other so fucking quick.  Like, you know, like the language thing you and I talked about before, that is more of a liberal thing because look what happened with Geraldine Ferraro.  She was a very big Hillary supporter.  She said something honest where she mentions race.  Oh, she's got to distance herself.  And then Randy Rhodes, who has been, again, one of the ones who has been kind of pushing this mentality, fucks up about Geraldine Ferraro, not even on the radio.  And Ferraro wants her fired. 
[04:32:30]  Well, that was sexist, her attack.  They're also, every one of them, all they do is live to catch the next one, fuck it up, and they bite them on the ass.  It's fucking terrible.  You know, it started during, you know, when I was in college in the Vietnam War, and the, you know, there's this whole group who wants to bring the troops home.  And it's like 19, and they go to the convention, and they go, and then half the people, instead of trying to just figure out a strategy, they just basically tear each other apart.  I mean, it's how the Democrats implode. 
[04:33:00]  Instead of dealing with what's in front of them, they kind of go, it's much easier for me to scream at the guy across the table.  You know, it's like lunacy.  They're insane.  Yeah, they've never been able to pull it together.  No.  At least Jimmy Carter tried to rescue.  Well, Jesus.  Seriously, he tried it?  Buckle that was.  It was, but he tried it.  I like the fact that he tried it.  I mean, I respect that.  It didn't work.  Well, here's what I find out about Carter.  I don't like the fact it took him that long to try it.  You know, in retrospect, it's just the price of gas thing. 
[04:33:30]  Right.  Which they basically hung him over.  Now it's like we're in, this is like mega shit.  Yeah, yeah.  Nobody ever was like, well, okay.  He sat and did nothing as the price per barrel just went up.  Now, I don't know.  What could he have done?  Put a little more pressure on OPEC?  Talk to him?  There were some options, but the fact that he just did nothing.  He's been doing nothing.  Here's what you do.  Well, the fact that he, I'm fighting terror.  I'm fighting terror.  He invaded a country that has oil.  Can't you steal some of this shit? 
[04:34:00]  You know, that's the, and that they're not paying their freight.  Yeah.  In the end, they're not paying, they're taking the oil money and it's going to something,  it's going out of the, I mean, it's like, you've got to be kidding me.  And he still holds hands with them in the garden.  He's still, our president's holding hands with them.  And he walks around with the, yeah, Saudis.  Well, that thing, I mean, you go, you end up, you know, we're yelling about Islam, but then  you go, the 18 of the 20 guys were Saudis. 
[04:34:30]  And we're over, and then he's over there.  20 out of 20, we're both of them.  Yeah.  But they were Saudis.  Yes.  They were Saudis.  15 of the 19.  Yeah, we're Saudis.  Yeah.  And he goes over, and nothing.  But the House of Saud, though, let's be honest, I mean, the fucking people hate them like  the way they hate Musharraf in Pakistan.  Right.  The people are all radical.  Right.  I think that's why he's nice to them, because the fucking people hate us.  I don't know how much, I don't know Saud as much, I don't know Saudi Arabia as much as  I know some of the others.  It's a wonderful place, especially for a woman. 
[04:35:00]  Yeah.  Especially if you've been raped as a woman.  Yes.  And they put you in jail for enticing the gentleman.  Yes.  It's a wonderful, wonderful nation.  That's right.  But they come in from, my favorite was, they drive in the women from, what is it, the women  from, is it, the women from Saudi Arabia go to Kuwait so they can drive?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just so they can drive?  So they can drive.  Yeah.  Kuwait's a pretty hip place.  No, but it's like, you know, but it's still, it's like, how do you not put, he's an oil 
[04:35:30]  guy.  Isn't, wasn't it also part of it that you have two oil guys and we can't move?  Yeah.  And he lost money in the oil business.  Yeah.  Not now.  And then they go, and then you get the guys sitting near the oil companies, which they've  done my entire life, which continue to make a ton of money.  And you go, isn't there something wrong with no?  They just kind of go, we're here, we're going to piss on your foot and we'll see you.  We're not going to discuss the profit level we're at.  And we don't.  But we've also become even more dependent on, on foreign oil because we've had to shut 
[04:36:00]  down our refineries.  We're not allowed to build any new ones because again, the liberal thinkers say, you know,  there's a spotted fucking owl over here that needs his little home.  So we can't put an oil derrick here, or we can't put a refinery there.  Leave Alaska alone.  Meanwhile, it's sitting on fucking a ton of Wesson oil down there.  And we can't, we can't pump that because environmentalists get very angry. 
[04:36:30]  We're, we're, we're past the point where we have to deal with that.  Dig a hole in the fucking tundra.  Is anyone going to Alaska?  I like to know that.  Is anyone vacationing in Alaska?  I like to know that it's just there being for steam.  Don't drill in Hawaii.  Don't drill in fucking the Caribbean.  Leave the Bahamas alone.  Fucking Alaska?  Who gives a shit?  Sink a thousand fucking wells in that place.  No one's going to care.  No one's going to notice.  Unless they showed us the Exxon Valdez.  Would any of us know it fucking broke up over there? 
[04:37:00]  Nope.  Because that drunk fucking was sleeping and let his second in command steer into Alaska.  Bunch of fucking lazy animals getting fucking oil on them.  Yeah, who cares?  Run away, you lazy shits.  Stop.  Light them on fire.  They'll feel warm for once.  Yeah, exactly.  Little bastards.  Fucking stupid geese.  Fucking ducks.  Oh, look.  Blacks.  Sink them.  It's syrup.  They fly into it and try to eat it.  Fucking assholes.  They were just curious, Jimmy.  I bet you that's why they crashed.  I bet you a gull flew in his face. 
[04:37:30]  Fucking asshole animals.  Alaska sucks.  It does.  No one knows what goes on up there.  They can say everything's fine.  Look, we're getting a bunch of oil from somewhere.  Shh.  Don't tell them it's Alaska.  None of us would know.  They rub noses and live in snow houses and fucking shit in their blubber pants.  They're fucking idiots.  No one likes them.  Bunch of drunks.  Pump away.  Pump away.  They have those giant whaling hooks hanging for good luck.  They think it's charming in a home instead of wind chimes. 
[04:38:00]  They have a whale hook.  Fucking assholes.  We're moving in.  Grab your mucklucks and dig a hole.  I just want to the horizon to look like a bunch of those little drinking bird things  that bob up and down.  Only they're oil derricks.  That's what I want to see.  Did you ever work there?  No.  I've never done a gig in Alaska.  You've been to Alaska, Lord?  I did the box theater there.  How was it?  It was...  Oh, man.  I knew you were in Alaska.  I played everywhere.  You're an Alaska lover.  I just played every place.  How is it that you're called out or what, people? 
[04:38:30]  Oh, they all come out.  There's nothing to do.  How come they can't sleep?  It's fucking six months of life.  You can fucking drill at three in the morning and see everything.  Bunch of fucking assholes.  It's 11 p.m.  I've got to wear sunglasses.  Really, you should be fucking burned alive for not moving.  Fuck you and your dumb...  Your shitty wilderness.  You don't like nature, Jimmy?  I love nature, but not for a fuck where I can look at it for.  I want to look at it until 8 o'clock and then it gets done.  It's a good thing you never worked there, because the thing... 
[04:39:00]  You drove...  I went there in the winter.  Like Christmas.  Nice.  That's a treat, to play Christmas.  They really are rolling in.  Do they even have a snack for that show?  I literally went to the bar.  There were five people in the audience who went to the bar and just got shit-faced.  Really?  I said, I'm not going to sit here and talk to you.  What kind of...  That was where I learned that thing, the duck fart.  That's the drink they like.  Which I can't now remember.  It used to be...  Was this after you were like Lewis?  Like, or was this way...  Oh, this was way before.  Oh, okay.  I can't picture you not selling.  No, no.  I was not selling. 
[04:39:30]  It was Christmas Eve.  Imagine the most bitter people on earth.  Wow, yeah.  Five people in Anchorage, in my audience.  That's...  And I'm going, let's just get fucked up.  Every fucking gift...  And we all come to the bar, do the act for each one of them individually.  Exactly.  Every gift.  Oh, look.  Another oil-burning lamp.  Thanks.  I can have fun with this.  Oh, look.  Another big coat.  But I drove out.  There's a...  There's a...  There's this place you drive out through this...  They've got this...  This...  This...  This little inlet in this bay. 
[04:40:00]  And you kind of drive down it.  And it's beautiful.  Supposedly beautiful.  Well, it's like, you know, zero out.  And it's just frozen.  And then you go to see this...  This glacier that's at the end of it.  And I literally get out.  And I went, it looks like my freezer at home looks because I don't defrost it.  And it's even got that blue to it.  You weren't impressed.  And you absolutely...  This is it.  That's what those fucking assholes they are.  You came out to see frozen shit.  They show you fucking ice.  Look at that. 
[04:40:30]  Look at it.  They have nothing to show you.  And then they say, come back in the summer.  Okay, so I perform.  I go back in the summer.  I'll go to a gig.  Now, you got to go out.  You go out in the bay and stuff.  And they're going to go see fucking Alaskan fucking wildlife.  Well, we come around a corner.  There's a mountain that's just, you know, this big giant rock covered in shit.  Just covered in, like, fucking shit. 
[04:41:00]  And these birds are flying around.  They're essentially Alaskan pigeons.  And they're going, this was the Alaskan turn.  Great.  And that's what we're saving by not drilling oil up there.  The Alaskan turn.  I said, it's a fucking, it's a pigeon or it's a, or it's a seagull fucker.  Yeah.  It's no different than the fucking thing.  And then there's two, we saw two puffins.  Oh, nice.  Two.  And I said that they tied them to a rock.  Because these fuckers didn't move. 
[04:41:30]  That was it.  To show the tourists.  Wildlife, yeah.  Four hours.  Right.  The Exxon's on cue the puffins.  You should have been here yesterday.  The whales were out.  Fuck you, the whales were out.  I'm here today.  Show me a goddamn whale.  The whales were out my ass.  The, uh, the Exxon.  Come up with a plastic whale.  Fucking inflate one.  The Valdez is the best thing that happened to Alaska.  It was fucking, it was, they did it on purpose.  They're a bunch of attention whores.  Bunch of fucking blubber attention whores.  Fucking assholes.  You know what my problem with the Valdez was? 
[04:42:00]  Not full enough.  Fucking blacking up those shitty beaches.  What, do they go to the beach in their fucking winter coats?  We're gonna make another snow castle.  Fucking cunts.  We should use Alaskan for oil slash nuclear testing.  And then make them live there.  No one will take them.  No one will take the Alaskans.  No one needs them.  Fucking exactly.  Dig a hole in that shitty fucking place you live in and live under there for a little while. 
[04:42:30]  Rub noses.  Look at the penguins.  The National Bird's a smelly emperor penguin.  Fuck them.  With that, we want to thank Louis for stopping by.  We're not getting too much better than that.  No, that was perfect.  That's beautiful, Jimmy.  Louis, why don't you hang with us anymore?  I don't have time.  I'm never fucking hurt.  We're hurt.  We love you.  We used to have fun with you, Louis.  I know.  I've just never fucked around.  It's like the old days, isn't it?  Huh?  It's like the old days today.  It is like the old days.  This is really good stuff. 
[04:43:00]  When are you gonna write about the voyeur bus?  You're up to your 12th book and you're still not writing about it.  And you always tell me, next book.  What is the next book?  Rich Lou, Poor Lou.  Rich Lou, Poor Lou.  Hi, this is Louis Black.  You're listening to...  Fuck.  This is Louis Black.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  The worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[04:43:30]  I know.  Heath Ledger, day two.  Is he still nude?  Nude.  It's, uh, it's, uh, it's, uh, who gives a crap?  Yeah.  Well, they finally calmed down on the whole nude thing.  I think the news finally realized, like, why, even they realized, why do we have to bring  that up every two seconds?  Right.  That his nude body was found.  So now they're just saying he was found, you know, face down. 
[04:44:00]  I wanted to say this yesterday.  I'm going to say it today.  Uh-oh.  Heath Ledger, in my humble opinion, OD'd on the H.  You think so?  OD'd on the H, I tell ya!  All right.  Well, I got a couple of questions for you then.  Yes.  How come the police said they found no illegal drugs in the apartment?  You got a suspicious masseuse that was over there, and she was supposed to rub him down,  and she pretty much discovered that he was dead, cold to the touch, by the way, I'm reading 
[04:44:30]  in the paper today.  Ooh.  Uh, although the maid, way to pay attention, she said, she said he was snoring when she  was cleaning out the apartment.  Went in to change a light bulb, I believe, in the room.  Right.  Because his door was shut, and heard him snoring.  Right.  That was probably a death rattle, and she didn't even identify it as a death rattle.  Oh, sweet dreams to her.  Yeah.  Good one.  She's got to take that with her for a while. 
[04:45:00]  Hey, watch him.  I bet he died of sleep apnea.  Like Reggie White.  Maybe the pills kept him from waking up.  Yeah, probably.  Why don't we all throw what we think on the table here, and then we'll see who's right.  I'm going to go with the OD, and it's going to be the H. And I think the masseuse who called  Mary Kate Olson, who was, I guess, dating Heath Ledger back there in California, she was  sending her private people, private security people. They're calling them rent-a-cops.  What was that about? And the masseuse was on the phone with Mary Kate Olson. This is a 
[04:45:30]  mystery now.  They didn't call 911 right away.  No.  She called Mary Kate Olson, who said, all right, I'm calling my security people, and  they'll be there. And they arrived before the cops did.  What else was discussed on the phone?  So perhaps what you are implying, in your humble opinion, is that these security people  may have cleared out the apartment of any contraband before the police arrived.  Yes. Because I was also reading in the paper today, a lot of these pill experts are coming 
[04:46:00]  out of the woodwork. And they're saying that it's almost impossible to OD on the stuff he  had in his apartment.  But then I'm reading in the paper that if you take this Valium and too much Valium or  too much Xanax, and then you drink a whole lot, that you could stop breathing.  It could be a lethal combination?  That's what the paper says. Who do you believe?  They say these pills have kind of like a safeguard. Like you'd have to take a lot of them. 
[04:46:30]  Yeah, yeah. You'd have to take a lot, but maybe he was.  Now remember, I just skim things in the morning, so don't take what I just said as truth and  all of a sudden start popping pills because you're tired tonight.  The masseuse, the Heath Ledger masseuse, who I told you yesterday looked a little, eh, there's  something going on with her, right?  She comes over there on a regular basis to rub him down. Well, the inside track is saying  today that the masseuse who found the body of actor Heath Ledger works on Martha's Vineyard  in the summer, rubbing many celebs the right way, dot, dot, dot. 
[04:47:00]  Now what could that possibly mean, the right way?  They're basically saying she will perform the Yankee Cranky.  They're basically...  Jot, jot.  This is what they're basically saying, but they're not brave enough to go the distance with this.  Yeah.  When you say rub celebrities the right way, dot, dot, dot, that means you're getting more  than a freaking massage.  Yeah.  But they don't want to go any further than what they wrote today in the inside track. 
[04:47:30]  You're getting a happy ending.  So she's extremely suspicious, and I guess she traveled with Heath Ledger, this masseuse,  you know, to rub him down here and there.  And she said in an exclusive interview that she had some kind of special relationship with  Heath and Mary-Kate Olsen.  Hmm.  So she felt comfortable enough to call Mary-Kate Olsen, and that's where I'm starting to think  there's something that is not being told to us yet. 
[04:48:00]  Yep.  Something is going on.  And I'm going with the H, the OD.  Well, they will know with toxicology reports.  Can't hide that.  Right.  So?  People are delusional.  They think if you have a drug problem that you're going to walk into a restaurant and  just be completely insane.  Yeah, out of control.  There are people walking among us.  There are people working among us that have really bad drug problems.  And guess what?  You don't know about us.  Ooh. 
[04:48:30]  You got people that are on the H right around you.  You're right.  And you have no clue.  They're able to hide it for the most part.  The hamburgers.  H for hamburger?  Yes.  They think that they're going to say, hello, how are you?  And you're going to go, not good.  I'm on drugs.  I'm on the dope.  Right.  Can you tie me off before you bring my eggs?  Where are my works?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where are the works?  I'm just saying.  This is what I'm thinking.  I have no clue.  I don't have any connection to this thing. 
[04:49:00]  Mary Kate Olsen is apparently, let's see, she is like Marcellus Wallace.  All right.  And then she sends over her security people who are like the wolf.  Okay.  To chill them niggas out.  Oh!  Well, that's from Pulp Fiction.  Leave me alone.  But, uh.  Wow.  You know, that is what her job is now. 
[04:49:30]  Oh, you feel better now, mother.  So, so she, you know, she gets a phone call from a very distraught, uh, person.  Yeah.  Saying that there's a problem.  Yeah.  They got a problem.  Yeah.  Saying that this apartment is not dead actor storage.  Yeah.  And, uh, then, uh.  Dead actor storage.  Dead actor storage.  And, uh, she sends over the wolf who will arrive shortly. 
[04:50:00]  And, uh, yeah.  And cleans up the whole problem.  And then, uh.  I guess they all went to a diner.  I really believe that there was a cleaning up of the problem.  That's what I think.  I really do.  And they found, what, a $20 bill rolled up?  Rolled up $20.  Which was clean.  Yeah, there was no dope in there.  But.  Hmm.  This is what I say.  Maybe we could get, uh, Jim C.  The wolf is very, um.  In this discussion.  All right. 
[04:50:30]  But I'm thinking if you're going to be rolling up, uh, you know,  some bills to do some stuff.  Yeah.  Ah, you roll up more than one.  You, would you?  Why not?  Would you?  Um.  Because I never did.  Yeah.  I never had more than one after you buy some.  Yeah.  I never even had one.  The system was filled with methamphetamines and barbiculate, Sam.  Whoa, Jim C.  Jim C making an appearance on the Opinality Show.  The coroner, Jim C.  Yes, Jim C. 
[04:51:00]  Jim C.  It looks like murder.  Does it?  How could it be murder when nobody, uh, was there, uh, until he was dead, really?  There were pills scattered all over the bed, Sam.  Oh, Jim C's so passionate.  He really is.  Now, I see you're running your finger down a leg.  Is that Heath Ledger's or your flat-ass companion on the boat?  It's a cardboard cutout I took, and I talked to it on the boat.  Take your tiny genitals out of here, assistant Sam. 
[04:51:30]  We have a homoerotic relationship.  Wow.  Wow.  Man, to hear it right from Jim C.  It's, uh, fascinating.  She lays on her stomach, and I do lines off her flat-ass.  It's like a mirror.  Jim C rules.  Oh, we love Jim C.  Jim C gets to the bottom of everything.  Of course, it's always murder.  Murder.  Murder.  It doesn't matter what it is. 
[04:52:00]  Hi, Brian Kilmeade, sports guy, also co-host of Fox & Friends in the Morning on, you guessed it,  the Fox News Channel.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.
