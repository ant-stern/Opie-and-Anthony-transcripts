<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a phone interview with UFC President Dana White following UFC 100.  White discussed the event's global reach (75 countries), its groundbreaking social media presence on Twitter, and the highly successful undercard, specifically mentioning a bloody Mack Danzig fight. He praised Brock Lesnar's main event victory over Frank Mir but criticized Lesnar's unprofessional post-fight conduct, including targeting a sponsor, and harshly criticized referee Steve Mazzagotti's performance.  He also covered the Henderson-Bisping and Belcher-Akiyama fights, and promoted the upcoming Philadelphia UFC event featuring BJ Penn vs. Kenny Florian and Anderson Silva vs. Forrest Griffin, highlighting strong ticket sales. The hosts interjected with anecdotes about backstage encounters with Lesnar and Mir, and compared UFC's fan interactions to boxing.  They discussed the UFC's transparency and White's future plans, including potentially signing Fedor Emelianenko.  The call was briefly interrupted by a dropped connection before resuming.  The hosts also briefly discussed the deaths of boxer Arturo Gatti and Alexis Aguayo, and played audio highlights of Joe Rogan's commentary and Brock Lesnar's post-fight interview.  Much of the discussion centered on the differences between UFC and boxing, and the UFC's unique entertainment value.  Lesnar's post-fight apology and speculation about future UFC matchups and the inclusion of WWE personalities were also touched upon.

The show then featured a segment with their engineer, Mars, whose mispronunciations and a bizarre phone call contributed to what the hosts called a “bomb” of unexpected humor.  The hosts speculated on the declining box office numbers of *Bruno*, suggesting Sacha Baron Cohen’s absence from their show (following his successful *Borat* appearance) was a factor.  Anthony then launched into a profanity-laced rant about shoddy American workmanship after his Shelby GT500's exhaust pipe fell off due to a loose bolt, recounting how "Mustang Mike" helped him temporarily fix it with a coat hanger.  The conversation shifted to Steve, an executive producer who recently married in a tattoo parlor, detailing the bride's body painting and the unconventional venue.  A discussion of the staff's extensive accumulated sick days and vacation time, particularly Steve's, followed, leading to a debate about employment policies.  The hosts briefly mentioned a visit to Kevin Smith's movie set, a near-missed meeting with Bruce Willis, and a call from listener Lydia about her visit to F.H. Riley's.  In-studio guests Rich Voss and Bonnie McFarlane were introduced; Bonnie promoted her documentary about women in comedy.


Bonnie McFarlane and Rich Voss, who remained in-studio, were then the focus of a lengthy segment.  The discussion covered challenges faced by women in stand-up comedy, their relationship dynamics, and Bonnie's documentary (referred to as a "cockumentary") about female comedians.  The conversation included discussions about whether women comedians need to adopt masculine traits for success, comparisons between Joan Rivers and other comics, and a detailed, explicit account of their first sexual encounter. Their ongoing marital issues, including Rich's perceived "assholishness," communication styles, and disagreements were explored with specific examples.  Their sex life was also discussed, including Rich's Viagra use and Bonnie’s candid comments about his kissing.  The title of Bonnie's documentary, Rich’s behavior during golf, and their Twitter interactions were further topics.  Kenny, an unnamed individual, brought Bonnie a snack during the broadcast.


A subsequent segment featuring Rich Voss and Bonnie McFarlane started with a discussion of Loudmouthgolf.com clothing, quickly transitioning into a series of explicit anecdotes.  Topics included Rich's strained relationship with his manipulative mother, childhood experiences involving his father's arrests, and how these shaped his distrust of women.  Their relationship was explored through crude stories about their sex life, disagreements, and parenting challenges.  Bonnie's comedy career and her family's reaction to her explicit material were discussed, along with comparisons to Chelsea Handler. A clip from a previous interview with Dana White criticizing a referee and Brock Lesnar was played.  The hosts reacted with crude humor to a news story about a woman falling into a manhole. Rich’s technological struggles, particularly his phone, were discussed alongside further vulgar commentary.  The segment concluded with continued explicit jokes and anecdotes about their sex life and bodily functions.


The final segment focused on Bonnie and Rich's failed Comedy Central pilot, "Bonnie Gets Rich," which had a budget exceeding $250,000.  McFarlane described the show's unrealistic, heavily scripted nature and awkward scenes, including one involving Rich's ex-wife, Kelly, and the unsafe Baltimore filming location.  The pilot’s failure was attributed to negative focus group responses.  The conversation shifted to Rich's anxieties about the paternity of their daughter, Raina, despite Bonnie’s assurances.  The discussion became increasingly vulgar, filled with sexually explicit jokes, personal anecdotes, and speculation about Raina's resemblance to various people,  intertwined with discussions about Rich's views on women and his shaving habits.  A photo of Raina was mentioned and her features analyzed for paternity clues. A caller from Atlanta provided a statistic that 10% of children are not fathered by the husband, furthering the discussion. The show ended with plugs for their upcoming shows and further discussion about obtaining footage from the failed pilot.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  And good morning, welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Wow, that's sliding into home plate.  Good morning, Anthony.  Good morning.  We have Dana White on the phone.  Yeah, he was going to call in later, but something tells me Dana has, I don't think Dana just got up.  I think Dana's probably up for the night before.  No, probably been awake.  Dana's been partying since Saturday night, I do believe.  He's three hours early for his big phone call with us.  Dana, how are you, buddy?  I'm good. How are you doing, guys? 
[00:00:30]  We cut our ecstasy of gold and everything just to get you on the air.  I appreciate it, man. I appreciate it. I'm still up, so thank you.  Are you still in Vegas or have you left?  No, I'm in Vegas, yeah.  How's the mood there? You had an amazing, amazing night on Saturday night, man.  It was crazy, man. Seriously, this whole town was just absolutely insane. It was so crazy.  What a card, man.  We have a guy who works for us.  And, you know, I said it at the press conference, told everyone, this time, this fight aired in 75 countries live. 
[00:01:00]  Wow.  75 different countries, this fight aired live.  And we were getting, one of the guys who works for us in production got an email from a guy in Scotland who was doing a golf tournament out there and said,  you couldn't go anywhere in Scotland, that this wasn't playing in the bars and it's all anybody was talking about.  It was pretty amazing. It was a big night for us.  No, it also happened. I think it was the first sporting event that people were following on Twitter.  My fucking Twitter blew up. 
[00:01:30]  People just talking about the fights, giving the results, which in some cases were fine because a bunch of people warned and said,  look, I'm going to give results tonight, so if you want to see this, you know, don't read my updates.  But people were following the fights on Twitter.  And I don't think that there was a sporting event that has done that.  I think you're the first one, my friend.  Yeah, you know, we're real big online and, you know, for years we didn't get covered by the mainstream media.  And really up until Saturday night was the biggest mainstream coverage we've ever had. 
[00:02:00]  I was going to say that, yeah.  It's kind of a defining moment for UFC, UFC 100.  It was watched by so many people and just an amazing card.  I mean, it was really a great night of fights.  It was.  The fights were great.  And a lot of guys didn't get to see the undercard.  The undercard was really good, too.  You know, I think there were three submissions where guys literally got choked out. 
[00:02:30]  And the one fight, what's his name, was bleeding.  Probably, I've seen some bad cuts.  But it had to be the worst.  Oh, yeah.  It wasn't that.  The worst cut I've ever seen.  Was it the Coleman fight or no?  No, it was Mack Danzig.  Yeah.  Mack Danzig got that cut.  And it was gushing.  The mat was full of blood.  Didn't he fight that guy?  He fought some guy, Miller, I think, Jim Miller?  Yeah.  And the guy come in.  The guy walks in.  And his walk-in music is Credence.  And I'm like, this guy is a fucking problem. 
[00:03:00]  Anybody that walks into the ring listening to Credence is a fucking major problem.  And that was a bloody match.  So people just watching the pay-per-view turn it on.  And they see this bloody mat.  So you know that the undercard was pretty rough.  The undercard was phenomenal.  We watched all the fights.  It was just phenomenal all around.  The Brock Lesnar thing.  Now, I got yelled at on Twitter.  Because after that whole Brock Lesnar thing, I was really excited and pumped up.  And my adrenaline was flowing.  And I'm like, this is awesome. 
[00:03:30]  And then people just beat the hell out of me on my Twitter going, it's not awesome.  It's not good for the sport.  It's not this.  It's not that.  And I'm like, oh, I'm sorry.  What's your thoughts on the Brock Lesnar thing there, Dana?  I gave Brock my thoughts as soon as he left the office.  I imagine you did.  It was, you know, listen.  Brock gets fired up.  And, you know, the hard part for me is I know Brock Lesnar.  He's a good guy.  He's a smart guy.  For him to go out and do what he did to me personally that night, you know, is what I was upset about. 
[00:04:00]  Meaning him going after one of our sponsors, just being goofy.  I mean, I'll tell you guys, listen.  Brock made a lot of money.  He made a lot of money on Saturday night.  So to be, you know, I've never dealt with anything like that before.  It's never happened to me.  And, you know, I've been in a fight business since I was 19.  And I've been in this business for 12 years.  And it's never happened to me before.  So that was a first.  Right.  Yeah.  He came out and it seemed like when he walked into the press conference. 
[00:04:30]  It actually made me like Lesnar more.  To start with the fight, he didn't even touch gloves, which has always been the thing with you guys, Dan.  Calvin Sportsman.  What was that?  Was there a lot of shit talking leading up to the fight?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  See, there's the thing, too.  You've got to understand there was a lot of bad blood between these two.  I mean, real bad.  I mean, Frank Mir was saying stuff, you know, in the media and in the countdown show basically saying, you know,  Lesnar is going to get destroyed. 
[00:05:00]  This guy knows nothing about fighting.  You know, I'm going to rip his leg.  I should have ripped his leg off that night.  You know, lots of crazy stuff was going back and forth between these two.  And Lesnar was really pissed off about the first fight that he thought he should have won.  And the referee, you know, made a, you know, basically cost him the fight.  Right.  And didn't he get mad that the ref, he said, let him tap too long, too?  He said that he thought he tapped and that he kept tapping.  And he was right.  Listen, Mazzagotti, as a referee, this fucking guy shouldn't even be watching MMA on TV, let alone refereeing it. 
[00:05:30]  Wow.  I think he's the worst ref in the history of any fight business ever.  He's horrible.  Hey, there's an exclusive.  Stupid me.  Hey, I thought you picked the refs.  No, we don't pick the refs.  Yeah, right?  You don't pick those guys.  No.  The Athletic Commission does.  Yeah, no, I know.  Those guys are picked by the government.  You just don't like that guy at all, huh, Dana?  It's not that I don't like him.  He's a nice guy.  No, you don't like what he does out there.  That's what I mean.  He's an absolute nice guy.  He has no business whatsoever being anywhere near mixed martial arts. 
[00:06:00]  Wow.  Can I tell you, too, we saw this when you saw Lesnar and Mir walk out.  Yeah.  Frank Mir looked uncomfortable.  And again, Bob Kelly was with me, and Bobby has forgotten more about MMA than we all know.  And he's like, nah, dude, he looks like that every fight.  He looked like, to me, I'm like, this guy looks worried.  And then as the fight is progressing, I'm like, please tell me he's working up to doing something.  Because Lesnar, it looked like a schoolyard type of beating, where Brock had his head kind of held, 
[00:06:30]  and he was just beating him the way the jock would have probably beaten me, Anthony, or Opah.  I've seen people on the bottom be able to defend when someone's on top,  and they're punching them or trying to punch them in the face.  I've seen people on the bottom do a great job of defending against that.  Lesnar was punching right through any defense that Mir was trying to come up with.  And just pummeling him.  It was amazing.  It was amazing to watch.  And anybody who knows mixed martial arts knows,  if you get anywhere near Frank Mir's guard, you're probably getting submitted. 
[00:07:00]  He's probably the best submission heavyweight in the history of the game.  He got, Brock got down there, and Frank Mir couldn't do anything.  He was powerless.  And Brock is so big and so powerful.  Their first clash, before they hit the ground, by the time they hit the ground for the first time,  Frank's bridge of his nose was already cut and bleeding.  I mean, Lesnar, man, I'll tell you, I gave this guy a shot.  He was 1-0.  I said, this isn't the place to learn how to fight. 
[00:07:30]  His attitude was, I'm either good at this or I'm not.  I'm going to find out.  I only want to fight in the UFC.  And it's amazing what this guy has done.  Yeah.  We're watching some footage of him flipping off the audience.  That was awesome.  That's always a good time.  Yeah, but you know what?  Next time he fights, you watch the numbers.  If you think you're doing well now, I mean, everybody's going to want to watch the next Brock Lesnar fight.  Some to love him.  Some to watch him get his ass kicked. 
[00:08:00]  But even though you said that wasn't what you wanted, you said we're not in the business of making heels or any of that stuff,  it still did work out where people are going to want to watch this guy fight.  Oh, yeah.  Listen, I think people would want to watch him fight just because of how big and strong and unbelievably talented this guy is.  What an amazing athlete he is.  What's his next fight?  Do we know or any hints toward who he might fight next?  Don't know yet.  We've got Shane Carwin and Cain Velasquez fighting, and probably the winner of that fight will fight Brock. 
[00:08:30]  Jeez.  Both of them are going to lose their fight on purpose.  As you're watching this.  They're fighting each other.  Somebody's going to have to win.  You're like, why would anybody volunteer for this?  I don't care how much money you're making.  Because Frank Mir, when you're watching him get beaten, you forget.  He's, what is he?  I think he's 6'2 or 6'3, 245.  He's not a little guy.  He's a massive dude.  He looked small.  He looked small, though.  Yeah, he weighed in at 245 pounds and absolutely in amazing shape. 
[00:09:00]  He trained hard for this fight.  He was in great shape, and he was 100% confident.  You know, I said before the fight, I've never seen Mir's confidence higher than going into this Lesnar fight.  Yeah, so Bobby was right about his face.  Bobby's like, dude, he always looks like that.  He's relaxed.  That's just the way he fights.  And we saw, the whole fucking night, Dane, was amazing.  It was, the card, Henderson-Bisping was an amazing fight.  Oh, yeah.  I've never seen anybody knocked out.  And this dude is a good boxer.  He's a good fighter. 
[00:09:30]  He got caught with a right.  And Rogan is such a great announcer.  Rogan called it.  Rogan goes, he keeps moving to that left.  Right before it happened.  Joe Rogan, never get rid of Joe, man.  That bastard is good.  He said he's going to move.  He's awesome, man.  He said he's going to move right into that right hand.  And 15 seconds later, he moved into that ugly right hand.  And wow.  Now, what about that second hit on him when he was on the mat?  What are your thoughts on that?  I mean, was it unnecessary or was that just part of MMA?  Was there a little revenge going on? 
[00:10:00]  Listen, there's a lot of times that a guy gets dropped and he's not all the way out.  And they can fight on the ground.  You know, you're allowed to go until you intelligently can't defend yourself.  Dan is saying that he was, you know, he hit him.  Then he was going back down for that last shot.  And he said, I wasn't hitting him again.  Then I knew he was out.  You know, he said something stupid.  It was the night of saying stupid things.  Apparently so.  You know, about that last one shut him up just because, you know, he wanted to get the crowd going. 
[00:10:30]  And, you know, you just don't say shit like that.  I wasn't happy with Henderson either.  You know, it's just not who we are.  It's not what this sport is like.  And that's not what Dan Henderson is like either.  To see him go down like that and then to see him take another hit when he was in La La Land.  I mean, there was no way he remembered falling down, never mind that second hit right across the face.  Wow.  How about the Belcher-Akiyama fight? 
[00:11:00]  That was his first fight in MMA, right?  No, it was his first fight in the UFC.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm not UFC.  Yeah, from Japanese.  Yeah, yeah.  Fight of the night.  Yeah, that was a good one.  Yeah, but what were they calling him?  Because he was a model?  Oh, yeah.  What's that?  That guy was a model?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  The guy from Japan.  He's a model.  He's three things.  He's a model slash.  Model singer slash MMA fighter.  Actor. 
[00:11:30]  Actor.  I got a problem.  I don't know whether I should fucking fight him.  Raging bull.  So we got to move on to the press conference.  So there's Brock Lesnar sitting there with a Bud Light bottle.  I'm like, wow.  But it makes you.  Wow, David knows how to do some talking.  Dude, it makes you like Lesnar more.  It really does make you.  Because he came out.  It's like that was to me like when he came out like he had been like, all right, I got  my ass chewed out.  To me, like that was the first time you see this guy like, oh, that's who he is.  Like, he's just a regular dude.  He got his ass chewed out by the boss. 
[00:12:00]  And now he wishes he didn't say that stupid shit.  Like, I liked Lesnar a lot more after seeing him at that press conference.  I'm going to tell you right now.  You know me.  If somebody's a dickhead, I'll say it.  Lesnar's not a bad guy.  I just don't want, I just don't get why he's, you know, acting like, but his thing is,  listen, I don't, this is his honest to God thing.  He's like, I don't give a fuck if they boo me or cheer me.  He says, I could care less.  Yeah.  You know, he says, I'm out of here fighting for me and my family.  And if they don't like me, fuck them.  You know, that's his attitude. 
[00:12:30]  I said, cool, I get that.  But, you know, stay away from my sponsor.  That was just, that was another fight where you can tell it kind of clicked the whole MMA  up another notch.  It put UFC up another notch in entertainment, in credibility, respectability.  It's just one of those fights where people are going to go like, wow, yeah, I remember  that one, you know?  Yeah, it was a night to remember.  And like you said, you guys were here in town, man. 
[00:13:00]  This whole town was buzzing.  You know, we had the, we had the fan expo that, you know, we had, we had between 30 and  50,000 people that came in just for the fan expo, people that couldn't get tickets.  Jeez.  Everyone was there.  Everyone.  And can I tell you, this is, I emailed Dana.  I don't know if you got the email, but I got to say one thing, not one fighter that I  met was a dick.  Not one of those guys, like, because they were all over the casino, we would see them  walking down these giant hallways in the back to go to the media room. 
[00:13:30]  Every one of them would stop and say hello, take a photo.  I watched them interacting with the fans.  And like, Machida was surrounded by fans in the casino.  Yeah.  And just talking to everybody, even though I don't think he speaks English, but just,  you know, smiling.  And just every one of these guys treats the fans well, man.  It's really, it's so much different than boxing.  When you're with Bob Kelly, everyone seems like a dick.  Bob Kelly, can I tell you, Bob Kelly, Bob Kelly, again, who I love and loves MMA.  We're backstage.  This is a great story.  Listen to this one, Dan.  And Reed Harris, who we're walking back and it was right after the fight. 
[00:14:00]  So we see Brock walk by right after the fight and he just looks awesome.  I mean, he's, he's, he really is a force when you're standing two feet away from him.  And so we all just say, congratulations, man.  And, you know, he nods and he keeps going.  And then Frank walks through and Frank looked pretty beat up.  Like I was surprised how beat up he looked like standing that close to him.  And it was a really sad feeling because you're watching a great fighter who was just, who's  lost a fight and you want to say something to him, but you don't know what you, what do  you, what do you say?  And we're all just kind of quiet. 
[00:14:30]  And Bob goes, good job, Frank.  He wasn't trying to be a dick.  He really loves Frank Mir.  But as a comedian, that's just what you say to somebody like, Hey man, good job.  Like, you know, it was a bad crowd.  Like, that's just what we say.  And it was just a reaction.  He goes, good job.  And you know, thank God Frank didn't just take out his aggression.  He should have punched his face.  But it's like, you don't know what to say.  You want to make the guy feel better somehow.  You want to give the guy a hug when you see him beat up like that.  You want to go, look, man, don't worry about it.  You don't, what do you say to somebody after a fight like that? 
[00:15:00]  It's the same thing.  I went back and talked to Stefan Bonner and I said, how are you feeling?  You know, and Bonner was like, you know, feeling like I want to hang myself.  I'm like, cheer up, kid.  You win some, you lose some.  It's all good.  You know what I mean?  It's like, the one thing about being a fighter is that, you know, it's not like the Yankees  play the Red Sox and you lose as a fucking team.  And you're like, ah, fuck it.  We got 152 more games this season.  We'll win the next one.  You know what I mean?  It's, when you're a fighter, you go out there by yourself, you know, and you're as good 
[00:15:30]  as your last fight.  It's a tough business, you know?  So, yeah, it is cool when you see the guy say, hey, you know, good fight.  Now, you know how I know that?  Because during, when I play UFC Undisputed and I get an email from Dana after losing a  fight, it's very nice.  It's like, you know, hey, you lose some.  It was a tough fight.  Here's your next one.  I'm like, okay, Dana, I understand now.  I feel better about myself.  Anthony's character is the only one in the UFC game with a dress.  Hey, chop meat does good. 
[00:16:00]  What else, what do you get, Elsa, you got brewing there, Dana?  Anything you could talk about?  You know what?  We're excited to come back to the East Coast.  August, we're coming back to the East Coast.  We're going to Philly.  Doing Philly for the first time, by the way.  Yeah.  Listen to this.  Philly for the first time, the thing's almost sold out.  It's already the biggest event ever in the history of that state.  What do you mean?  It's the highest grossing event they've ever had.  Wow.  And you got, and fighting, where exactly in Philly? 
[00:16:30]  This is August 8th, I think.  Am I correct?  Yeah, at the Wachovia Center in Philly.  And they are fighting BJ Penn, I think, is the main event?  Yeah.  BJ Penn taking on Kenny Florian.  And, well, yeah, what's his name?  Holy shit.  Forrest Griffin and Anderson Silva.  Anderson Silva's moving up to 205 to fight Forrest Griffin.  I want to see that one, man.  Me too.  Yeah.  Forrest just looks menacing everywhere.  I saw him just sitting there signing for people, and we've had him in.  He's a nice guy.  He's a funny dude.  He rules.  He just looks menacing. 
[00:17:00]  You can't.  Even when he smiles, you're like, he can literally just bite my face.  He's definitely a problem.  Hey, Dana.  You guys got to come out for that fight.  Dana, I'm.  Absolutely, man.  We're all going.  Yep.  It's going to be my first live UFC event.  I can't wait.  In Philly.  I like that, especially.  You can ask those guys, man.  It's just so much different live, man.  The energy and the buzz, it's just, it's an incredible night.  The feeling of when the music starts, and we've all watched it on TV, but when you see  these guys coming out, I don't care what weight class they're in, when you see these guys 
[00:17:30]  coming out to their music, and you just watch this entourage walking out.  Like watching Gladiators.  It is like watching two guys walk into a Roman college.  It's an amazing energy.  You can't get anything like a live fight, man.  I'm kind of addicted to it after going to two events.  It's like, I want to see these things live.  If I have to watch them on pay-per-view, I would watch them on pay-per-view.  I really would.  But I want to go live and watch these guys fucking fight.  Because the undercards are amazing.  I'm psyched.  I just got my nosebleed seats for the Philly show.  I'm pumped.  I got my binoculars.  I'm ready to go, Dana.  You didn't get your seats yet? 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, right.  Yeah.  Dude, the seats.  Can I tell you the seats that these guys do nothing but give out amazing seats?  I saw your picture on Twitter, man.  Jimmy had awesome seats.  Dude, they gave us one row up from the floor, but first row.  So we were eye-level with the ring.  And Reed is just the greatest.  He kept bringing fighters over to say hello.  He brought over Machida.  He brought over Rampage.  He brought over Rashad Evans.  He brought over Hoist Gracie.  It was almost...  We were treated so well, it was almost embarrassing. 
[00:18:30]  We have such low self-esteem that anybody treating us well, we don't know how to handle.  Some guy sitting next to me, after Hoist Gracie came over, just said hello.  Some guy next to me finally went, who are you guys?  To me and Bob Kelly.  He's like, who are these fucking nobodies that these champions keep coming up?  So, dude, the whole night was amazing, man.  And thanks for taking care of us.  Yeah, Jimmy just been...  Aren't those the best seats?  When we buy...  When me and Lorenzo buy tickets for boxing, those are the seats we buy.  They're the best.  50-yard line, front row up, you know, the first row up. 
[00:19:00]  You can see everything.  You're right there on the level, because you're looking through...  When you're watching in the octagon, you're looking through a fence.  And I was on the floor for the first one, which is amazing, but you're looking up a little bit.  This is up like a couple of feet, and there's no one in front of you.  It makes all the difference, right?  Dude, it's fucking eye level with the ring.  It's amazing.  Dana, I've got to read this, because I think this has happened a lot.  Someone just wrote in, I was never a big MMA fan, but thanks to the UFC game and ONA,  I ordered UFC 100.  I'm now hooked.  That's awesome.  And now you're going to have it in Mexico? 
[00:19:30]  What you said, you opened it to, like, what, 100 million on free TV in Mexico?  2 million people, and to about 240 million in China.  So you know that eventually these people have to see it for free a couple of times.  Is that what you did?  You put it on free TV, and, like, you know, let's be honest.  Yeah, we put it on free TV.  Yeah, that's my philosophy.  Think about it, guys.  When we were growing up, and you became boxing fans back in the day,  it's because you used to see all the big fights on ABC's Wide World of Sports.  They had USA's Tuesday Night Fights on, and that's really where all the big pay-per-view stars in the 90s came from. 
[00:20:00]  And I'm a big believer.  Plus, you know, our fans buy 12 pay-per-views a year.  You know, I can take it on the chin and give them some big fights now, you know, five, six, seven times a year.  Right.  And you mentioned, the one thing I like about the way you run the organization is there's, like, a transparency.  It's like you don't hide things from the fans.  And I think that's kind of why it rolls downhill, and the fighters kind of feel like they're on the same level as the fans in a way, too.  Like, you talk about things. 
[00:20:30]  You don't just brush it under the carpet.  Like, when the Lesnar thing happened or when you weren't happy about what Dan Henderson said at the press conference,  or before the press conference, you're like, what did he say?  And you talk about it.  You don't sweep it all away.  And you're very open about it.  And, like, Fedor, you get sick of hearing about Fedor, and, like, he's with a competing group right now.  But you mention him at the press conference.  And you're like, look, that's the fight people want to see is Fedor or Lesnar.  I'm going to try to get it done.  He's got one more fight under that contract.  And you admit that you're going to go after him.  Whether you get him or not might be beyond your control.  Right, exactly.  It takes two people to make a deal. 
[00:21:00]  But you know what?  And the way that I run the business, it's like when you try to bullshit people, people know you're bullshitting.  You know?  And some people don't like the way that I talk.  And they're like, how are you ever going to go mainstream with the way that you talk and the things that you say?  Listen, I'm a fight fan just like any other fight fan.  And I'll come out and tell you, we had a shitty show tonight.  This show sucked.  And I'm going to try to make it up to you and give you the next one on free TV or do it again or do something else.  You know?  You get out there and you have your lawyers write shit for you and you try to, you know, you go out there and try to lie and cover things up. 
[00:21:30]  People see right through it.  To me, what's the point?  Fuck it.  Yeah.  Absolutely, man.  I was watching you after at the press conference.  Dana was doing some interviews that were just with some smaller Outlet guys holding.  And you were just sitting there kind of holding court and they were asking you questions.  And I caught part of what you said to one group.  You said, they wouldn't even give us a meeting.  Who wouldn't give you guys a meeting back in the day that probably you went and pitched UFC to and then said no? 
[00:22:00]  EA Sports.  Who's that?  EA Sports.  EA Sports?  Oh, no kidding.  The video game company.  Oh, okay.  And they said that they didn't even want to sit down with you guys.  Right.  Oops.  They said we're not a real sport.  That was a smart move.  Real flash in the pan, UFC.  Well, way to have insight into the way.  But it's amazing.  Boxing, look, respect to boxing.  UFC guys had to just stand up and box.  It's a very tough way to make a living.  But UFC, it makes it hard to watch boxing anymore.  I was saying the same thing.  You watch UFC and, all right, the guys are standing there and they're throwing some punches. 
[00:22:30]  And it's like, hey, where'd that foot come from?  Yeah.  Hey, you just put this foot on the side of that guy's head.  And it adds an element that boxing just, in my opinion, can't compete with.  Thank you.  Dana?  He's gone.  What happened?  Well, I imagine he didn't hang up on us.  I think he said, screw you guys.  Wouldn't it be funny if I didn't like your comment?  Wouldn't it be funny if whenever Dana called, he gave himself an 11-minute maximum, regardless 
[00:23:00]  of what's happening.  And as we crossed over, he just hung up.  And then just hung up.  He's got OCD with numbers.  And hanging up goes against everything you just said for the last five minutes.  I don't want to talk about that.  Click.  I'll tell you, if a question sucks, I'll tell you this.  I'll tell you that.  Click.  That's funny.  Hey, what the hell happened?  You don't have to put him on hold.  Just type in his name.  Yeah, just put DW.  We know who he is.  Dana?  Were you bored by Anthony's comment? 
[00:23:30]  No, I got dropped.  Okay.  What did you hear us up to?  Right when I said EA Sports.  Oh, okay.  We were talking about, there's nothing worse than when you think you're hitting a home run  because someone is really paying attention and you realize their call just got dropped.  Basically, and we've been saying it a lot.  I mean, UFC is making boxing look ridiculous.  Yep.  I'll say it.  I mean, boxing is still, no, it's ridiculous in my eyes because they're just boxing.  So much can happen in that octagon. 
[00:24:00]  So much can happen that it's not just two guys duking it out with their fists.  Like I said before, you were rudely dropped.  You know, you're watching and then there goes a foot right upside somebody's head and you're  like, holy shit, where did that come from?  Well, you know, it's crazy.  You know, I came from boxing.  I was such a diehard boxing guy.  And a lot of things have hurt boxing as far as the business goes.  And there's still some fights that are interesting that I want to see Pacquiao fight again. 
[00:24:30]  I'd like to see Pacquiao fight Mayweather, you know, and things like that.  But it's so true.  Now when you watch boxing, you know, you'd be watching, watching, like, come on, kick  him, kick him, kick him, kick him, kick him, kick him, kick him, kick him, kick him down.  You know, it changes the way you watch fights.  You know, it's like when the guy's up against the ropes, you're like, fucking choke him.  What are you doing?  Just stepping back.  Standing eight.  What is this shit?  But it removes, there's so many elements of attack in UFC, which is, it's like, you forget  that they're punching for a couple of minutes and you forget that, oh yeah, now he's going 
[00:25:00]  to grab him and throw him on the ground and then try to break his arm back.  It's just, every angle is covered by UFC.  Dana, you think it would ever become an Olympic sport?  I do.  You know, I say this all the time.  When you think about it, really, it should be an Olympic sport.  If you think boxing is an Olympic sport, wrestling is an Olympic sport, they can do taekwondo  where they can kick and strike and do all the things.  Judo is an Olympic sport where they use submissions.  Everything that we do is an Olympic sport already, but, you know, who knows? 
[00:25:30]  The way that this thing's growing, it could happen, but I hope I'm alive to see it, you  know, if it does happen.  And George St. Pierre, by the way, was, it was, it was, it was like a really, uh, they  were kind of on the mat through the whole fight, but what a specimen, that guy.  He's a physical specimen.  And he fought the perfect fight that night.  You know, here's the other thing about him.  He, he, uh, he tore his groin during the third round of that fight.  After the fight, he couldn't even walk, you know, but he went two more rounds and you 
[00:26:00]  couldn't even tell that it happened.  Alvarez could not stay on his feet.  It was just amazing how many times he was thrown on his ass that fight.  It really was.  And what would, what shocked me too is George St. Pierre dropped him too.  He what?  He hit him with a straight right hand and dropped him.  Oh yeah, yeah.  He was, uh, he was throwing him down at Will and whenever he wanted to put him on the  ground, he was putting him on the ground.  And watching the fight, it's amazing how you watch these guys right before the fight.  Uh, when St. Pierre's getting ready to come out, um, uh, as he's walking, uh, are we saying 
[00:26:30]  his name right?  Yeah.  Okay.  He's walking, he's pacing, uh, back and forth in the ring.  And I'm like, why would anybody step into the ring with this guy?  Yeah.  And then St. Pierre just fucking pretty much manhandled a really good fighter.  He manhandled him.  Definitely.  No doubt about it.  And I said it too, before this fight, man, I said, this is going to be the tough, the toughest  fight of his career.  And he went out there and absolutely, you know, handed it to him.  Anytime, anytime he went inside on that guy and tried to do anything, uh, St. Pierre would 
[00:27:00]  just throw him on his ass.  There was nothing, there was nothing he could do about it.  GSP is a study, really.  It was, it's embarrassing to be like in the same species class as him.  It's like, is genetically that who I compete with to fucking, to, to spread my seed?  It's really, uh.  But what sexy shorts, right, Jim?  Dude, I'm pleased.  Did you see his heart from, from where you were sitting?  I could see it.  I was out getting popcorn and I saw it.  I was, I'm like, I hope, I'm like, I hope that's a cup because that really makes me feel  like a girly man. 
[00:27:30]  Oh my God.  That is funny.  Yeah.  He wears the tight shorts and a cup that's really big.  Yeah.  I don't believe, he wears the cup that I would wear if I could get away with it.  Just like, are you sure you want a triple XL?  No, yeah, just relax, yes.  Give it to me.  It'll look good on TV.  Right.  Shorts, it's amazing.  That guy's smart.  But yeah, it was, it was, the whole, the whole night was, was really great and every  fight was great.  Who else is fighting August 8th?  Because I know I want to go to that.  You got BJ Penn and who else is on that card?  Yeah, BJ Penn and Forrest and, uh, and Anderson Silva. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah, Silva.  That's a nice, uh, card, man.  All right, so August 8th at the Wachovia Center in Philadelphia.  Fucking Philly gets UFC.  They are pumped down there, my friend.  Is there any kind of a fan thing going on or is that tough to pull off because of the  location?  Yeah, no, we're not doing that.  This was our first one.  So, you know, we're going to regroup this week and figure out when we'll do the next one.  Well, you should do another one because it was, I just walked through a couple of times,  every fighter that you'd want to meet was there signing and, uh, they were all, you know,  they were all organized in the line. 
[00:28:30]  It was actually better than the Porn Expo, which I thought was, is like all this madness  kind of focused and done very well.  This is even better.  It was organized and everybody got to meet whoever they wanted to meet.  So it just, it was great, man.  The whole, whole night was fantastic.  Thanks.  I appreciate it.  And thanks for your support.  You guys are the best.  Well, thanks for everything, man.  We'll definitely see you soon.  And, uh, you put on the, the night was amazing.  I was happy for you after Lesnar won like that.  I think that look is no disrespect to me, but I think Lesnar winning overall is better for  the UFC because it's a recognizable name and it's like, this guy's not a fluke. 
[00:29:00]  He didn't just walk in and, and Hey, he won a couple of fights.  This guy, now that he's learned a little more, he beat the submission expert.  Just watch your numbers.  The next time Lesnar fights, I mean, it's going to be unbelievable.  Randy Couture and Frank Mir, he's taken all three out, you know?  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  I mean, exactly.  He didn't just beat me or he beat, uh, he beat Couture and he's, he's like, the guy's  the real deal, man.  And it's like, a lot of people don't want to admit that they want to go, Oh, he's just  this big wrestler who came in and throws his weight.  No, he's fucking, he grabbed Frank Mir by the head and he kept under punching him. 
[00:29:30]  That one was, yeah.  And I wanted to yell, get off him.  Get off him.  So a great night, dude.  Great night.  Thank you.  Thank you guys, man.  Hey Dana.  Thank you.  Go get some sleep.  All right.  See you soon, buddy.  All right.  Dana White from the UFC, obviously.  Uh, very cool.  That was big.  Like you said, the whole Twittering thing too, it was just like, and people getting mad.  Stop it.  Oh no.  I don't know what happened.  Yeah.  But the people were saying, look, I'm getting, I'm doing results.  So don't read my tweets.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:30:00]  I liked it actually.  I didn't think I could, I, I, I was at a bar and they didn't have the fucking fight.  So the Twitter was, uh, keeping me informed.  Your Twitter, Bob's, uh, Bob Kelly's, uh, Patrice, Patrice is an animal with this freaking  UFC loves it.  And of course, Rogan himself from the broadcast booth was, uh, Twittering.  I didn't.  And then I got to see the highlights, uh, yesterday morning.  So I didn't realize that I'll be giving away results.  Like I didn't think of that.  Like, cause I was using my say now number too.  Cause I, it was just like, I was listening.  I called while they were announcing Lesnar one just to hear people bullying and stuff. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  And I, I didn't realize that a lot of people may not watch the fight until later.  Oops.  But I should have warned them at least.  Yeah.  But people using, people using Twitter and all this other social networking, they, they, they,  they understand and can figure it out.  Oh, okay.  Jimmy's giving shit away.  I'm not going to, I'm not going to read his stuff right now.  It's kind of hard in this day and age to keep, uh, results and quiet, you know, well,  here's, uh, we want to play some highlights, but then Dana White call, but it's worth playing  Joe Rogan and Mike Goldberg play-by-play as Lesnar wins. 
[00:31:00]  Frank is getting beat up here.  He's taking some big shots and his face is splattering blood all over his shoulder.  In the power shots of Brock Lesnar.  He's got so much power in his fist, Mike.  Frank is making trouble.  That's it.  That's it.  That's it.  That's it.  That's it.  That's it.  And it is all over.  He's out.  Brock Lesnar is the undisputed USG heavyweight champion. 
[00:31:30]  Dude, as the sport continues to grow, this is great for the sport.  Yep.  Brock Lesnar.  Hell yeah.  And what he was doing.  Uh, then the post-fight interview.  This was, this was amazing.  Oh, you guys, I haven't been able to find that online.  I'm good.  Oh, this is amazing.  All right, I'm here with the champ, Brock Lesnar.  First of all, Brock, congratulations.  You got your revenge.  Give us your thoughts on the fight.  I love it.  Keep going.  Keep going.  I love it, man.  You were very worked up even after the fight, even after you beat Frank Muir down. 
[00:32:00]  You still were upset and you got in his face.  Tell us why, why you're still upset.  Frank Muir had a horseshoe up his ass.  I told him that a year ago.  I pulled that son of the bitch out and I beat him all the way with it.  Woo!  Love him or hate him.  Who doesn't want to see that guy fight next time?  Of course!  You know, I think Dana White obviously has to control the situation, but I think Dana 
[00:32:30]  kind of liked this.  How could you not?  I can't speak for him, but I think he kind of liked that Lesnar lost his mind after the fight.  Dude, it bothered me because I felt like you should be graceful when you beat a guy like  that, but it means I would want to watch Lesnar just to watch him get a fucking beating.  There's going to be a million people now watching for him to either win or lose.  Probably, but I would bet, I don't know.  60-40 against him.  I wouldn't be surprised.  I was trying to come up with a number quickly.  Yeah, it's going to be close though.  Well, it's going to be one of those things where people are going to want to not like 
[00:33:00]  him.  That's, first of all.  And I think people like, like you were saying, that whole being gracious thing.  Yeah.  I think that's part of boxing that isn't really going to carry over well is that whole, you  know, it's a gentleman's sport.  It's the, I like the fact that some of these people go in there not liking each other.  There's none of this mutual admiration bullshit when they don't like each other.  They fucking want to go in there and put a horseshoe up his ass.  Well, he was saying that he was lucky when he won. 
[00:33:30]  A horse should be lucky.  But these guys are martial artists.  You know what, sportsmanship sucks a big dick.  Because most of the time it's just fake sportsmanship.  You know, you know these guys legitimately don't like each other.  I'm talking about sports in general.  And then to see that horse shit after the game's over, it's like, oh, go fuck yourself.  Well, he was a great fighter.  I sat there.  A lot of respect.  He threw some good.  Not even fighting.  Any sport.  Football.  Hockey.  I mean, you can name the sport.  Yeah.  That fake sportsmanship that the league forces down a lot of athletes' throats, it makes 
[00:34:00]  me sick.  Like, I'd rather hear these guys speak, you know, like Lesnar was.  Because that's what he was feeling at the moment.  Yeah.  You know, any other sport, he would have calmed it down and thanked Jesus and all this crap.  There's something about the guys, though, after, especially fighters.  Like, I like, like, I made me watch, made me go back on YouTube and watch when Fedor won  his championship against Noguera in Pride.  And it was a brutal fight.  And then afterwards, he's such a, he's like hugging the guy.  There's like something about these guys after they fight when they're kind of like, I like 
[00:34:30]  it when they treat each other respectfully.  I really do.  That's it.  That really bothered me that he did that.  Really?  More than any of the other shit drove me nuts.  Because Frank Mir, it's like, you just beat this guy bloody.  Well, you're completely the opposite.  I was jumping up and down.  I was like, I love this.  The guy, before the fight, I'm all for it.  Whatever's got to happen.  But right after you beat the guy, even in post, post game later.  But in that moment, as the guy is there with fucking on one knee bloodied, you're still  the champion.  You just spoke.  I think there was a lot of shit talking though, Jimmy.  So then all of a sudden, because the fight's over, the shit talking didn't mean anything. 
[00:35:00]  That's where I get confused by all this.  To me, the shit talking is just, it's a way of promoting the fight.  It's a way of getting amped up for the fight.  It's a way of, even if they don't like each other.  But when you, to me, when you beat the living shit out of a guy, which he, Lesnar spoke volumes  in the ring.  He beat the guy badly.  Yeah.  That to me is enough.  You've just been, and I've watched other fighters who, you know, you know, Fado doesn't  like everybody.  He fights.  You know, a lot of these guys don't.  There's that moment of where they just go over and they go, hey man, it was, two guys  just beat the shit out of each other for our entertainment. 
[00:35:30]  I like when they had that moment together.  That used to give me chills like when I was growing up with a solid boxing match where  they were bloody, could barely stand, and they're trying to find each other in the ring  when there's a crowd in there.  That, I mean, I agree with you there.  That was an amazing moment.  You know what I like though?  The fact that they do give each other a hug and mutual respect and stuff like that.  And I think if everybody was shit talking after the fight, it would come off looking  a little WWE, you know, shit like that.  But when you have that authentic, I don't like this guy, you have a big muscle meathead 
[00:36:00]  like Brock Lesnar coming out there and bad-mouthing the sponsor and bad-mouthing the guy who's  still dripping blood from his face.  That brings that element of honesty to the sport that I think is new.  It's something that only the UFC is really doing.  And it's refreshing to kind of see that kind of honesty.  It's a real moment.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, they took all that stuff out of football. 
[00:36:30]  Everyone has to be nice to each other.  You can't celebrate too much after a sack or a touchdown.  Fuck that.  I say bring it all in to the sport.  A lot of martial artists, because it's a martial arts thing, people don't like that.  No, I understand.  Yeah, I understand.  No, there's a different discipline.  I understand all that.  But then Lesnar continued by trashing the sponsor, which this would pretty much get us fired.  Yes.  In the radio world, we would be fired for this.  You don't like promoting fights very much. 
[00:37:00]  You don't like talking trash.  You just like going there and getting the job done.  You did it.  You got it done tonight.  You've only had five MMA fights ever, and you've already avenged your one loss.  Give us your thoughts about your future and what you expect next as a challenge to your title.  I love it.  I love it.  I'm going to go home tonight.  I'm going to drink a Coors Light.  That's a Coors Light because Bud Light won't pay me nothing.  I'm going to sit down with my friends and family, and hell, I might even get on top of my wife tonight. 
[00:37:30]  See you all later.  God bless you, ladies and gentlemen.  Now, you notice before he started talking, there were a lot of boos.  There were a lot of cheers in there.  Yeah, big laugh.  It was pretty much, I think it was like 50-50 in the end.  Dude, he saved himself.  With the boos in there.  Yeah, yeah.  When he went up and yelled in Mears' face, people were like, what a douche.  Like, just not even in a good way, but like, ugh.  Like, to do that to a guy who just lost for whatever reason, it was just a douche move. 
[00:38:00]  But then when he did that, he got some big laughs.  I'm like, wow, what a recovery.  Fucking amazing.  He came back.  Dude, he really started off antagonizing the crowd.  Bill Burr in Philly.  Someone like Brock Lesnar, he knows how to work a crowd from his WWE days.  Post-fight press conference, then Lesnar changed his tune after Dana White had a little chit-chat with Brock.  He got a talking to.  First and foremost, I want to apologize.  I acted very unprofessionally after the fight, and I'll leave it at that. 
[00:38:30]  I'm a sore loser, okay?  And I don't like to get beat.  You won.  I believe that Frank and I's first bout.  I was talking about when he lost to Frank.  I gave that fight to him.  And so there was a lot of emotion in this fight for me.  I've been a fighter my whole life.  Wrestling was my way out.  I wasn't the smartest kid on the block.  I went into the entertainment business for a while, and I guess there's a little bit still that.  You guys ask me all the time, is there anything that I could drag over from WWE? 
[00:39:00]  And I guess you've seen a little bit tonight.  I apologize to Bud Light.  I'm not biased.  I drink any beer.  Tonight, I'm drinking Bud Light all night.  All right?  Wow, that's a turnaround, huh?  Oh, damn.  I hope Dana doesn't tame him too much.  No, no, he won't.  He won't.  I hope he doesn't tame him down too much.  Yeah, I think he understands that that's an asset.  Allow him to have some of that raw energy, because it's great to watch where I sit. 
[00:39:30]  I love it.  But it made me like him more.  Listen to him say that, because he goes, at one point, he goes, oh, you guys wanted to get to know me well.  And then he just talked a little bit about, and I was like, all right, the guy's an animal, but at least there's something relatable in him.  So I kind of liked him a lot more after that.  A brute.  Dude, he is a ferocious dude.  This is going to just, I mean, UFC doesn't need our help or anyone else's help, but this pay-per-view is really going to be the catalyst to just even greater things for the sport.  It is amazing that we were asking not too long ago, either. 
[00:40:00]  It's like, okay, you got some of the guys that are getting too old, you know, Liddell and stuff like that.  It's like, where's the next big guy coming from?  Where's the next name that people are going to go, holy shit, I got to see this guy fight?  It's Brock Lesnar.  That's the guy now that you're going to want to see in that ring.  And Chris Jericho, who's going to be making that announcement any day now.  What?  Yeah, he's going to be fighting in the UFC.  Undertaker.  And the Undertaker.  Got the Undertaker about to sign.  Ah, come on.  Let's go through this again.  What about, ah, and then let's name 20 dead rats. 
[00:40:30]  Chief Jay Strombo signs up.  See, now you guys are being silly, but we know the Undertaker and Chris Jericho will be signing very lucrative contracts very soon.  What about the ultimate warrior?  No, now you're just.  Now I'm just being silly.  The Iron Sheik.  Yes.  He's tinkling on everyone from the top ring.  One more from the press conference.  Lesnar continued.  Man, I was so jacked up.  I'm used to selling pay-per-view tickets, okay?  I come from a business that is purely entertainment. 
[00:41:00]  And Dana came back and, you know, we had our, you know, whip the dog session.  And I screwed up and I apologized.  But I have nothing against Frank.  No, like I said, the only thing that I had against Frank was that he beat me.  All right, we both talked a lot of crap.  And in the end, I was just amped up.  To any UFC fighter, if you beat Brock Lesnar, retire after that. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah, don't take a rematch.  Don't take a rematch with this guy.  No fucking way.  I'm Team Brock.  You, Jimmy?  No.  I like him more now, though.  Like, I would love to just.  So Team Brock.  I want him to beat whoever he fights next.  If he fights Fedor, I would root so hard.  You would go Fedor?  100%.  I wouldn't care if they fought in the U.S. Capitol.  And they fought with a Cuban Missile Crisis poster behind them.  I would fucking go Fedor.  Absolutely.  But you see what's going on here? 
[00:42:00]  Yes.  People will discuss this and go, no, I'm Team Brock.  No, I'm Team this guy.  Whoever he fights next.  Yeah, I would want to see him lose.  And then he's got to, like, put him up against a pretty solid dude next.  Oh, yeah.  He will put him up against anybody.  Huh?  I know.  He can, yeah.  But, I mean, but he's got something now, and he needs to take advantage of that.  Can I tell you how great Rogan is?  He was talking about what Brock was hitting, and he goes, and when you have those lunchboxes  slamming into your face, I'm like, what a great description and accurate.  Well, let's get fucking Rogan on the show today.  I would love to. 
[00:42:30]  I talk to Joe.  He listens almost every day.  He's a tremendous fan of the show.  He is so goddamn good.  He's a great announcer.  I mean, he loves it.  Such a good announcer.  He's never at a loss for words, but he's never just babbling for the sake of babbling.  Amazing.  He's got a passion for the sport.  We'll try to get him on.  I'm sure he's sleeping, but maybe you guys could, you know, tweet him and say, wake the  fuck up.  He's probably trimming those hairy knuckles.  Jesus.  Talk about meat fists.  Did he have major surgery a week before the pay-per-view, too?  Of course he did.  He had his sinus.  I forgot he had his sinuses fixed.  He's talking. 
[00:43:00]  He's like, yeah, I had two splints in my nose.  Well, geez.  And you're here in Vegas doing a fucking...  Yeah.  Why not?  Yeah.  He's just got that mentality, dude.  Yeah.  He's just a savage.  All right.  Why don't we take our first break?  Get into some other things.  Things.  A lot happened over the weekend.  Arturo Gotti.  Dead.  Dead.  Dead.  I don't know what we can say about it.  His wife basically strangled him with a...  With a purse friggin' strap.  With a purse strap.  What was that about?  What a way to go.  Mars is a big fight fan.  No?  Yeah, I was.  Was Gotti a good fighter? 
[00:43:30]  I know he was.  I mean, Arturo took a lot of punishment.  Arturo did?  Yeah.  In the ring?  Yeah, he took a lot of punishment.  He just stepped ahead and he, you know, just fought real hard.  He was a real hard fighter.  But apparently his wife...  A little tougher.  Yeah, there's a little more technique.  Yeah.  No kidding.  She knew what she was doing.  Coming in the ring with a purse strap.  He had a head injury, too, so she probably knocked him out or hit him with something  and then just choked his ass.  Well, he was drunk.  Was he?  Yeah.  He was drunk and he was asleep, but she probably hit him nice and hard while he was sleeping 
[00:44:00]  just in case.  And then choked him out with a purse strap.  Purse strap.  Arturo Gotti.  That's how he goes out.  Jesus Christ.  2009, the year of the celebrity death.  It continues.  Yes.  And that's what we really have on that.  What are you laughing at, Sam?  I don't know.  Mars' great contribution.  Oh, yeah.  Mars.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Sam's an ass.  He just can't leave it alone.  What more would you like me to add?  Well, you emailed everyone over the weekend. 
[00:44:30]  Make sure we talk about the death of Arturo Gotti.  Here you are.  See, Danny, right?  In case you missed the front page news today.  Yeah.  Was that his email?  Pretty much.  Pretty much.  Yeah.  Mars, what do you think?  He is indeed dead.  You see how he's like leaping through the paper uncomfortably?  Uncomfortably.  Trying to find something to say.  Yeah, apparently, I have nothing.  Please turn my mic off immediately.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes. 
[00:45:00]  Look at him.  She was a stripper.  Oh.  There it was.  Look.  A little insight.  And then he just rubbed his hands together.  He's warming up now.  Yes.  The beauty of Mars, he could kick the shit out of anyone in this studio.  Not true.  Not true.  Yes.  Yes.  That was an excellent, excellent way to agree.  Word of the day.  Very radio friendly.  Yes.  Do we have that at all?  That's great.  We just did an hour on UFC and two minutes on boxing, thanks to Mars.  Who's Arturo Gatti anyway? 
[00:45:30]  He wasn't a great fighter, eh?  Oh, he was great.  Was he?  Oh, okay.  Yeah, okay.  And I also emailed you guys.  And on the first, we lost Alexis Aguayo.  What happened to him?  Yeah, he died.  I didn't hear that.  Aguayo died.  Aguayo died.  Of what?  They didn't say.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  They didn't say.  When did he die?  July 1st.  Where?  I think in his country, Nicaragua.  Did he say Nicaragua?  Nicaragua.  In his country, Nicaragua.  How old was he? 
[00:46:00]  About 56.  Okay.  He was young.  Yes.  Why do you say it like that?  You're in America.  Nicaragua.  Don't we say Nicaragua?  Nicaragua.  Nicaragua.  It is a Spanish word.  Si.  Yeah, but say it like in America.  Si.  How do you say it like in America?  Nicaraga.  Nicaragua.  Nicaragua.  No.  Gua.  There's a G.  Nicaragua?  Nicaragua.  Pronounce the letters Mars.  Nicaragua.  That's how we say it here in America.  Us white boys. 
[00:46:30]  USA.  Say it how you say it.  Listen.  Nicaragua.  No.  Nicaragua.  You got that Latin blood in you.  Smooth.  God damn, she was sexy.  Hambure.  Hambure.  Ecuador.  Ecuador.  Mexico.  Mexico.  Mexico.  España.  Yes.  Yes.  I love the Mars. 
[00:47:00]  We'll take a break.  I was hoping for a little more on Arturo, but we got the info out there.  Oh, Mars.  How about, uh, he was, he was 37, right?  Yes, he was 37.  Let me just go to the video.  He was, uh, between 36 and 38.  Ah.  You're not going to find the answers in the paper.  Yes.  37.  37.  37.  7.  37.  Just leaving letters off the way Mars does when he says, Nicaragua. 
[00:47:30]  He said it properly, I guess.  Of course he did.  Whatever.  No.  Yes.  All right, we're going to take a break.  Thanks, Mars.  Excellent.  Excellent.  That was just amazing.  Another amazing appearance on the radio for Mars.  Yes.  We look forward to your next one.  It's just incredible stuff.  With great anticipation.  Oh, it's just incredible.  Maybe we can talk about me.  Me.  When are you going to sign your $100 million contract and take half a year off?  You're ready.  You're primed for that.  Yes.  Give it to him. 
[00:48:00]  Want Mars bomb?  What's that?  When he was on the phone with that UFC fighter last time.  Oh, yeah.  Let's hear this.  All more Mars.  All more Mars.  It was a Dana.  It was Dana.  That's right.  Yeah.  With Dana.  Listen to this.  Mars, no questions?  No.  Mars, what's wrong?  Mars is scared.  And he'll hang up.  And he'll have 50 things he wanted to ask you.  He was very excited that we were having you on the show today, Dana.  No.  Actually, I was talking to a friend of mine about Fedor.  A friend.  Yeah.  And I said how menacing he looked to me because he was so cool and calm. 
[00:48:30]  And the other individual swore to God that he was a power bottom.  Okay.  Dana.  Dana, that was the last appearance you'll ever hear of Mars, our engineer.  Wow.  We're back live.  Mars, that was wonderful.  We're going to have a montage of great questions from you.  My mouth dried up listening to that audio. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, my God, Mars.  Holy shit.  Holy shit is right.  I wish you would get in the ring with Brock Lesnar.  That could be the all-time.  No one likes you.  Get out of here.  That could be the worst bomb I've ever heard.  Yeah.  It's a bad one.  Because it was just met with.  Was that the end of the sentence?  No one could believe that was the end of the sentence.  Yes.  A lot of people call you a dummy because everyone knows that Argue...  How do you say it?  Argue.  Argue.  Argue.  And where was he again when he died? 
[00:49:30]  I think it was Nicaragua.  Nicaragua.  Nicaragua.  He was shot to death in his home.  And where's his home?  Where's his home?  Nicaragua.  No, we asked you how he died and you go, I don't know.  I don't.  I didn't know.  Why wouldn't you know that part?  Read the article.  Yeah.  Okay.  It's probably you didn't say natural causes.  It's a reaction to a lead input.  Oh, boy. 
[00:50:00]  It's Monday.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Bruno, number one movie at the box office.  Who saw it?  Anybody?  I heard the numbers dropped off drastically after Friday, though.  And they're trying to figure out what that's about.  Hmm.  It made $30 million for the weekend, but they're saying most of the people went on Friday.  Like the hardcore fans went on Friday.  And usually that would mean a big weekend overall, but the numbers dropped Saturday and Sunday.  I did not see it. 
[00:50:30]  I would say the numbers dropped because he decided not to do our radio show this time around.  I'll agree with that.  He did Borat.  He did our show when he did the Borat thing.  Numbers speak for themselves.  He doesn't do our show, and look what happened.  What's the big difference between Borat and this movie?  Him not doing our show.  Exactly.  Yes.  And he had a great time on our show.  I'm just going to do that all day now.  What, this?  Yes.  Yes. 
[00:51:00]  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  39% decrease from Friday to Saturday.  Ouch.  There you go.  That never happens with a hit movie, so.  Yikes.  They're like, what the fuck?  Seeing Bruno sucked.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  I think Sam saw it.  It wasn't as funny as Borat.  Sam said he liked it.  Yeah.  And he said.  Yes.  And he said the bits weren't set up.  No, a couple of them looked set up in the trailer.  The trailer looks like the whole damn movie was set up. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  Not a fan of that set up stuff.  No, I like the real stuff.  Yeah, come on.  Because Borat had some real stuff and then some set up stuff, and it was obvious what  was set up.  And the set up stuff, it's not as funny.  Mm-hmm.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Sorry.  There was something else.  Fucking Borat led to something, and I can't remember.  Oh, darn it.  I had a problem over the weekend.  What happened?  Fucking issue.  What was it?  I got a fucking ... Oh, boy, did I leave a nasty-ass voicemail. 
[00:52:00]  Ho-hoo.  Of course, you know I got my car back.  Right.  Yay.  Yay.  And I've enjoyed it over the weekend.  A lot of fun driving around.  Well, driving home yesterday from my mommy's house, because Tawny's birthday is today.  Happy birthday, Dawn.  Happy birthday.  I'm driving home from mommy's house, because we were having a little cake and stuff for  Dawn, and I started hearing, like, wow, the exhaust is real loud all of a sudden. 
[00:52:30]  Please tell me your muffler fell off.  Does it even have a muffler?  Give yourself a bale.  Your muffler fell off of your fucking hot rod.  Dude!  Get the fuck out of here.  Dude!  Did it actually fall off?  Well, it fell down.  Was it just dragging on the L.I.E.?  It was dragging on the L.I.E.  Oh, how many people were laughing at you.  Dude, you're absolutely right.  Sparks flying.  I'm driving.  That's a ...  I hear it.  That was a hack line I just used. 
[00:53:00]  No, that was it.  I'm driving down the expressway.  I'm hearing the ... Yeah, thank you.  I'm hearing the exhaust.  Wait, before all that, I mean, just to set this up nice.  You sent your car out to Vegas for how many months?  For like a year to get it all souped up?  They've had that car ...  Six months?  Seven months?  For about six months.  It takes a lot of money to have this Super Snake conversion done to the GT500.  Because we have casual listeners. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  And then you finally got it back a mere ... Not even a week ago.  Not even a week ago.  Four or five days ago.  Not even a week ago.  Right.  I get it back.  And I'm driving home yesterday.  And I'm hearing ...  Like ...  And usually when I step on the gas, what you hear is the supercharger more than the exhaust.  So now I can't even hear the supercharger because the exhaust is just like ...  Real loud.  So I'm like, what the fuck?  So I pull over into a PC Richards parking lot, which is empty because it's pretty late on a Sunday. 
[00:54:00]  And I peek underneath.  You know, there's only six inches of clearance underneath there.  Can't crawl under that car.  And I see one of my exhaust pipes hanging down.  Jesus.  Dragging on the ground.  And I'm like, you gotta be shitting me.  And it's not cracked or broken.  It's at a point where a part of the exhaust goes into another part.  There's a clamp.  And then it's bolted.  Right.  It's a bolted part. 
[00:54:30]  Where it was bolted had come out and fell down.  So I get back on the service road.  Now I'm doing 10 miles an hour.  I'm way out at exit fucking fuck fuck on the expressway.  And I'm doing 10 miles an hour.  All the way home?  Well, another Mustang pulls up next to me and rolls his window down.  He goes, you drag it.  I go, I know, I know.  He goes, pull into the gas station.  It's coming up on the corner.  I'm like, all right.  I pull in.  This guy, Mike, I got it.  Mike? 
[00:55:00]  I got to thank Mustang Mike.  He helped me out.  He had a little floor jack in his trunk.  And a hanger.  So here I am with a hanger rigging my goddamn car that cost a lot of money and a lot of time.  And I'm driving it around like a **** with a goddamn hanger holding up my exhaust pipe.  I got home and called up and I got home and left a voicemail that was laden with curses saying, 
[00:55:30]  And I'm driving it around, I'm fucking 20 years old in my Nova that I got to use a hanger and wire up a goddamn exhaust pipe on a car that cost me a lot of money and a lot of time.  And I'm driving around like a fucking **** because I got a piece of a goddamn hangar holding up my exhaust. 
[00:56:00]  Who do you want to feel sorry for you?  Anyone that makes over $250,000 a year?  Okay.  Just so we know what you're talking to right now.  I put it all in perspective.  What I said was, everything's relative.  Okay.  If you buy something, regardless of the price, but it means something to you, and some incompetent fuckwad didn't tighten a bolt, then you can get mad.  I'm not saying look at the monetary value of anything. 
[00:56:30]  I'm just saying it's another case of pure American incompetence.  They're saying it wasn't welded right?  Welded?  It's not a fucking weld pipe.  All right.  I don't know.  Rick in Florida says...  I'm just yelling at Rick in Florida.  I bet you that you just did.  You probably hit a bump.  What did you do wrong?  Nothing!  I drove!  Yes.  By the way, I can't use the phones right now there, Mars.  Why would I?  Why would I be able to?  Now, if you say, do you have the answer, you won't hear a yes. 
[00:57:00]  Yes.  What a car hauler.  It was some incompetent fuck at Shelby that did not tighten down that bolt enough where the exhaust pipe meets the other part of the exhaust.  It's midway through the fucking body.  It's pretty much underneath the seats.  And that's exactly where it was.  Came apart.  And that's what the fuck happened to it.  Rick?  Hey, buddy.  Hey, Rick.  Hey, Ann. 
[00:57:30]  Every time that I've ever put an exhaust system together, I usually tack weld those joints together so that way the bolts won't come loose from rattling.  Well, let me tell you something.  The bolts came loose and that fucker slid right out.  And I am livid over this.  And if I don't get a fucking response from that motherfucker that I left, I left some message.  Oh, I was freshly pissed, too.  You should have recorded the message.  I was thinking that right after I did it. 
[00:58:00]  That would have been fun.  Right after I fucking did it.  I was thinking, God, I should have recorded that.  Because it was brand new, fresh pissed.  This guy wants you to blame the car hauler, not Shelby.  What?  Adele and Wacko.  I like to say Wacko.  Yeah, Wacko.  That's where all the Wackos live.  That's right.  That's right.  Wacko, huh?  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  That's smart.  The whole cars, man.  And those low-clear cars like that Shelby, I bet you money he snagged that clamp where 
[00:58:30]  he snagged that muffler when he was loading up in the car hauler.  Did he?  Did he snag a clamp that's in the middle of the vehicle when the only part of the car  hauler is under the tires, when there's nothing under the middle of the car in that car hauler?  Nothing at all.  Okay.  I just thought that might be a thought.  It ain't!  Okay.  Good luck, buddy.  Then again, you said the guy that delivered your truck, your car, had another one banged 
[00:59:00]  up on the thing.  Well, he was just fucked up because he didn't have the strap.  This just in.  Stephen S. from Bayshore.  There's a new tragedy just in.  Yes.  One of the 37 jets in Anthony's hot tub is slightly aiming in the wrong direction.  It is!  Really?  There may be a problem.  What happened?  Hey, shut up, you fuckers.  How'd that happen?  I'm mad.  I was driving my car and it fucking...  They're calling you Hamptons Anthony.  You want to comment?  They're calling me Anthony Dearest.  No wire hangers ever! 
[00:59:30]  Tina!  Hamptons...  Shut up!  I'm driving my car, which I just got back a week ago.  Fuck the what kind of car it is.  Fuck everything else.  You're driving your car.  It's a week old.  You get it back.  And the exhaust fucking falls down.  And you got it wired up with a hanger?  You'd be pissed too.  Mm-hmm.  Fucking angry.  Let's go to Tom in Philly.  Tom?  Hey, I just wanted to say it's too bad that Mustang Mike didn't have two hangers, 
[01:00:00]  because then he could have helped Dan with his lady problem in the passenger seat.  Could have helped him with two problems.  See?  Oh, no one needs an abortion!  See?  Because...  Punch it out.  All right.  You bring any ladies to Mom's house?  Very angry.  No, actually, I was just...  Went solo?  Went solo over Mommy's house.  Hung out there, and that was that.  It was the ride home that got me so angry with that clank-clank.  And then I'm hearing, like, I'm hearing that the exhaust doesn't sound right. 
[01:00:30]  So I let off the gas, and I hear, clank-clank-clank, clank-clank-clank, clank.  Like, that's not good.  One week, and the fucking...  Somebody didn't tighten a bolt.  And I have no recourse.  What am I going to ship it back out to Vegas?  You know what this guy's going to do?  He's going to apologize.  Here's going to be the call.  Hi, Anthony.  Yeah, I got it.  I'm really sorry that that really shouldn't have happened.  You're absolutely right.  And I'll be...  And I'll be... 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Well, there's nothing we can do about it, so I guess you could go fuck yourself.  You're really not turning these people around.  I'm sorry.  No, huh?  No.  Adam in Brooklyn, though, writes,  Anthony is just as angry as my father's friend who had his Harley tire come off while riding  after having it serviced.  Holy shit.  Wow.  That ain't good.  No.  I would imagine that would be a problem.  Damn.  That sounds almost...  Could be fatal.  Here I was worried that Anthony's caviar delivery was late. 
[01:01:30]  Thank God that's okay.  That's Vince A.  And Bayonne.  Danny has been punching up pictures of some good rigged car things.  And here's somebody who lost his headlights.  Yeah.  And he duct taped two flashlights.  But that's a gag picture.  No, that's got to be real.  That's not real.  Somebody else who was using a Pringles can as a hose.  Pringles can with clamps.  I believe that picture with the Pringles can, but I'm not believing the flashlights. 
[01:02:00]  You don't buy the flashlights?  Makes for a good picture to have sent around to people.  I think that's pretty funny.  It's funny, but they're all rigged.  They're really starting to call you Hamptons, Anthony.  You might want to squash that one.  Squash it?  God damn, the sauce fell out.  Well, Keith in Philly, boo-hoo, Anthony has to get an assistant to fix a minor issue.  Minor issue.  Blow me!  You piece of shit.  I'd like to see you driving.  Oh, great.  Lifestyle. 
[01:02:30]  Here he is in his Mustang.  Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  With his exhaust pipe falling down.  Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  He's fixing it with a hanger that costs more than a quarter.  I am not.  Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  No!  It's like anything else.  It's all relative, my friend.  So that when you're...  No way that's real.  There's a guy with a generator.  A gas-powered generator. 
[01:03:00]  Bolted to his trunk.  And a window air conditioner.  In his back window of his vehicle.  Plugged into the generator.  Because now he has air conditioning.  There's no way he can do that.  Why can't I be angry that my exhaust fell out a week after I got it because of incompetence?  It's not like the pipe snapped.  Like there was some kind of engineering problem with the metal that made up the pipe. 
[01:03:30]  And they go, we didn't know.  We didn't, you know, test this steel.  And it cracked.  It was a bolt that came loose.  Because some incompetent buffoon didn't do his job right.  Once again, good old American ingenuity.  That's why all the jobs are being sent overseas.  Because we can't do shit anymore.  We can't even tighten a fucking bolt in this country.  That's why all the car companies send their work out to Mexico.  To Mexico. 
[01:04:00]  Or Nicaragua.  Maybe if it was tightened to Nicaragua.  Yes.  Yes.  It wouldn't have been a problem.  How do you say Mexico?  Mexico.  You forgot the X.  It's Mexico.  You know, someone was killed at the running of the bulls in Pablon, España.  Pablon, España.  Did they have to kill the bull?  I don't know.  I think they like when that shit happens there.  Yeah, it brings more people. 
[01:04:30]  It brings more people.  Yeah.  Because it was starting to be too safe.  Let's go to Tom in Chicago.  Tom.  Hello, ladies.  How are you?  By the way, like, wherever I...  Hold on.  Yeah, wherever we go in this country, they're making everything ridiculously safe, and it's  all lawyers.  Obviously, they don't have lawyers in Pablon.  The bulls do.  Because the bulls are still running in the streets, and no one in that town goes, you  know, this might be a problem.  I got a lawsuit here.  Yeah, God bless them for allowing it to continue, because in this country, you can't do shit  because of the lawyers.  They're smart.  They're throwing the lawyers in front of the bulls. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, no kidding.  Huh?  I love those lawyer jokes.  Ant, I got to tell you, if I had a Chevy Cobalt for 13 grand and the muffler fell off, I'd  be having the same conversation.  Just be mad.  It's just an angering thing, yes.  I hate to point this out, but if you were kind of cruising along at 140 miles an hour  and that thing grabbed the road at the wrong angle, you might have a mortgage problem.  Exactly.  That thing might have just catapulted or crumbled, wrapped around the drive shaft. 
[01:05:30]  Who knows?  Who knows?  Those bastards.  Wait until they hear from me live.  It sounds minor, but it's a serious, serious issue.  Exactly.  Thank you, guys.  Punch it out.  Jason in Carolina wants to know if the mechanic's name was Howard.  Oh.  Let's go to Tom in New Mexico.  New Mexico.  He's from New Mexico.  Yes.  Hey there, boys.  Hey, Tom.  What's up, man? 
[01:06:00]  I was just going to say that a man in Anthony Cummings position can't be made to look ridiculous.  I'll give you a bye on that.  Yeah.  You got to pass.  All right, buddy.  I'll fight punching out.  All right.  Let's say hi to Tim in Chicago.  How are the Cubs doing?  The Cubs suck.  White Sox fan?  Yeah, always.  Always.  We want to know if Anthony washed his vagina after getting out of his car yesterday.  You son of a bitch.  Sorry, I had to do it, bro.  Yeah.  All right. 
[01:06:30]  Yes, I cleaned my vagina out.  Let's go to Tommy in New York.  Tommy.  All right.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  Hey, I'm in.  Send your car out to New Neek Whips out there in Calvert, and he'll hook you up.  Oh, yeah.  Well, that's what's got me really angry also.  Now, I just got to take it to some schlep Long Island mechanic.  No, you Neek Whips out there in Calvert, where he does all the-  Why are you calling mechanics schleps?  Half of them listen to the fucking show.  I'm just saying, I send it out to Vegas to have Shelby do it specifically, so it stays 
[01:07:00]  within the Shelby, you know, kind of lifeline there.  You should have kept Long Island working, my friend.  They would do you upright.  Oh, would they have?  Yes, they would.  Pimp my ride.  There would have been TVs in the back.  They got some talented mechanics on Long Island.  Button tuck and all that happy horse shit.  They all learn from Joey Butterfuoco.  Yeah.  They're all good.  I should have taken it there.  Yeah.  It's Butterfuoco now when you need him.  This guy thinks he might have worked on your car.  Jeff in Las Vegas.  Jeff.  Hello, Ant. 
[01:07:30]  Hi, Jeff.  How you doing?  Ant, I believe I worked on your car.  Oh, yeah?  What happened?  I don't know, man.  I don't think that it was our problem that did it.  I think you must have hit something.  I didn't hit anything.  Ant, come on now, Ant.  I don't hit things.  You were going probably too fast and you hit a rock.  Your fault.  Bolt not tight.  Your fault, Jeff.  Well, I'm good.  Let's say hi to John in Denver.  John.  Anthony, was Christina upset? 
[01:08:00]  Is she going to leave you now and go to Bobo?  Was she embarrassed?  She was embarrassed.  I made her climb underneath and wire up the exhaust.  One of the best bits in the last five years.  Holy shit.  God damn, it was Bobo hysterical.  Anything with you and Christina?  Was there any texting or phone calling over the weekend?  It was a little fun banter as far as the texting goes.  And then I get a phone call from her.  So I put the phone to my ear and I hear her and Awesome Garrett talking to each other. 
[01:08:30]  Apparently, my phone got auto-dialed on her phone and I was just listening in on her and Garrett's conversation.  Did she know this?  No.  Get the fuck out of here.  I texted afterwards.  I said, uh-oh, uh-oh.  I go, I heard your conversation with Garrett for a while there.  She's like, oops.  Does Garrett like it in the hiney?  She goes, was it?  No, she goes, was it the part about the show or part about Big Black Cock? 
[01:09:00]  She said that?  That's what it was.  I said, damn, I missed the good part because all I heard was talking about the show.  Oh.  Wow.  Yeah.  She wasn't happy with the picture I tweeted, by the way.  Really?  What the fuck?  I told her I was going to tweet a nice picture and she did the post.  Coming for a photo shoot.  In all fairness, the picture I did tweet doesn't do her justice.  No justice?  I don't think so.  No justice!  Someone said you work really fast and that she had a bone in the oven.  Jesus Christ.  I couldn't help but laugh at that one. 
[01:09:30]  Whoever that was, you made me laugh really hard.  People are horrible.  Whoever wrote that, fuck your name, man.  I love you.  Well, maybe we could get her in here and we'll do a nicer shot is what I'm getting at.  Yeah, you could do that.  Because she bitched on her Twitter.  Oh, thanks, though, for posting a bad picture of me.  I'm like, well, what the fuck?  Get in and do a photo shoot.  Yeah, maybe we'll redo it.  Let's say hi to Eddie in Newark, Delaware.  Now, Eddie. 
[01:10:00]  Eddie.  Hey.  Hey, took the wife's FX45, pretty high-end car, to the dealership for a recall.  And they said it was, you know, an hour or two recall.  Not going to be a big deal.  Little steel on the drive shaft.  I go to pick the car up.  Coming down, I'm following her home.  Find her home and see this more or less like a mini explosion in the back of the car.  The drive shaft.  The guy forgot to tighten the eight bolts that hold this drive shaft. 
[01:10:30]  And the drive shaft falls off, causes like $4,500 worth of damage.  That's fantastic, isn't it?  Didn't that?  Maybe a little.  Oops.  What's your job?  To fucking tighten the bolts.  Exactly.  That's part of the job of installing something, is tightening the bolts.  Exactly.  Fucker.  Yep.  Well, good luck.  All right.  Remember when I said, well, first this.  Nicaragua.  Right.  Of course.  Nicaragua. 
[01:11:00]  And we also got this one.  Are you getting any?  Perstrad.  Perstrad.  Perstrad.  Mars rules.  Remember when I said Bruno was going to lead me to something else and I couldn't remember?  Yes.  Hopefully not a new lifestyle.  No.  But speaking of that, our own Steve got married in a tattoo shop over the weekend.  Wait.  And he's not here today.  What?  Oh, no.  What?  I knew he was getting married. 
[01:11:30]  I forgot.  And I think, and I love his girl, but I think she got body painted with, that's what I'm fucking  doing, motherfucker.  I'm doing the tat thing.  Whatever.  But I guess she got body painted with the Foundry logo.  Where's Sam?  Because he was all over this.  Yes.  I want everything to have the logo.  But I guess they got, did they get married in the tattoo shop?  What do we know about Steve's marriage?  This would be his, what, second or third?  Second, I believe.  Second.  Jeez.  I don't know.  I'm not sure. 
[01:12:00]  I'm not sure to tell you the truth.  I think it's his second.  I think it's his second.  I would assume.  Sam, what do you know?  One of his marriages was declared not valid.  In the 38 states.  We love each other.  We want to adopt Matthew and I.  Sam, what do you know about Steve getting married in a tattoo parlor?  Give us all the details.  Well, I try to stay up on the social networking sites.  Yeah.  Just to keep up with what my friends and co-workers are doing.  Certainly.  And so I was looking at Steve and his wife's Facebooks and Twitters all weekend because 
[01:12:30]  they were just consistently getting updated with new pictures.  And apparently, like, they got married in this.  They said they were super secret and intimate.  But then, if you look at the pictures of their quote-unquote altar, there are pictures on the wall of tattoo flash.  Like, you know, at a tattoo parlor, they have pictures of tattoos you could get.  Right.  They're on the wall.  And then the next picture is them getting their tattoo wedding bands. 
[01:13:00]  And so you're assuming, based on that, that the whole ceremony was conducted in the tattoo place.  Yes.  I mean, literally, the walls are covered with...  Wait a minute.  Because, yeah, that lady looks like she's, like, the Dawn Cumia of their...  Yes, the Justice of the Peace.  Yeah.  Like, it's not just decoration.  There's pictures all over of possible tattoos.  Oh, that's a tattoo parlor.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  Think I'm married in a tattoo parlor?  Yes.  Because Steve wanted to save on transportation costs. 
[01:13:30]  And Steve is wearing sunglasses on his head.  Of course, well.  As is Mrs. Steve.  Well, they wanted to make it very casual.  You know what's weird about Steve?  I was invited...  Oh, well, wait.  I was invited...  How much do we have?  Wait, we only have a few hours left.  I was invited to their top-secret wedding that was supposed to happen, I think, July 4th weekend.  But I wasn't invited to this version of the top-secret wedding.  Right.  This was the top-secret one.  So, was there a wedding on July 4th, or did they get canceled? 
[01:14:00]  I said I couldn't go, because I had a trip planned.  You made some...  I guess I was...  I insulted him.  Sorry that I had something planned on July 4th, that he can't invite me the following week.  We didn't get a limo.  We have motorcycle gangs driving us to the reception.  What else do you know about the big wedding with Steve?  And then I guess...  They wanted to make it very private and top-secret, but, I mean, there's pictures all over the place.  Yeah, they posted all the pictures on all the...  Like, Steve posted on his Twitter right away.  So, I mean, none of this stuff is secret. 
[01:14:30]  Like, his wife then body-painted, I guess, herself for their reception.  Oh.  And so, they were like...  She body-painted...  I can't do the tattoo sounds, of course, I don't have that in front of me.  She body-painted flames all over her torso, and then wore a bikini top, and on her back did a foundry-type logo.  It is a foundry logo, the big cog. 
[01:15:00]  He even brands his own wife.  Jesus Christ.  But then she put...  Bad enough, you branded every fucking Opie and Anthony video, but now you're branding  your wife.  But she put her website name on top of the foundry logo, as if to say...  How did she get myhusbandsgay.com?  That's not her website.  And then, I guess, they went to their reception someplace where, I guess, the only guests  I know that were there, based on the Facebook pictures, were Lainey from Penthouse, who comes 
[01:15:30]  in.  Yeah.  Right.  And that madam.  Remember the madam who came in here, that blonde woman?  Yeah.  Yeah, she was there.  She was the one who hooked A-Rod up, I think, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They were the two guests at the reception.  So, they were the guests at the reception.  Probably the witnesses, also.  I didn't get invited, too.  I remember her on our show.  She gave us nothing, and then the next day, decided to, you know, spill the beans on everybody.  Well, yeah, your executive producer and her.  Yeah, great.  Thanks.  Thanks for that wonderful fucking milquetoast interview you gave us. 
[01:16:00]  Yes.  So, Steve Carlesi is officially a married woman.  Yet again.  They wanted to make an honest woman out of me.  Chrissy in Virginia, honey and picnic baskets were the two choices at the reception.  That is the, um...  I'm looking at what could be the altar.  It's skulls and, um...  That's a tattoo parlor.  Tattoos and the Grim Reaper is at the bottom. 
[01:16:30]  Obviously, some tattoo parlor just put, like, a little altar as a gimmick.  Yeah.  And Steve said, this is perfect.  This is my dream.  Is it her first marriage?  Second.  I think it's her second.  I was going to say that.  That's why they went with the casual.  All right.  That makes a little more sense.  If it was her first, he should be shot.  Well, casual is casual, but this is a tattoo parlor.  I hope it ends...  I hope it ends like the Gotti marriage.  Somewhere in Brazil, they're on vacation.  Her purse strap breaks. 
[01:17:00]  Oh, I thought you meant his purse strap.  Oh, yeah, true.  His pocketbook.  She gives him a good choking.  Unbelievable.  Well, good for Steve.  Yep.  Godspeed.  Good luck.  Good luck to you.  Yeah, she's been very nice to all of us.  She's a sweetheart.  Yeah.  He'll be back tomorrow.  Well, now he...  I guess he's taking every Monday off for the rest of the year or something.  Yeah.  I got that email.  He's got...  What the fuck's going on with our show and this place?  He's got a lot of sick days stored up.  So he told me...  He told me on Friday... 
[01:17:30]  He didn't want to tell me about the wedding, but I found out he was getting married this weekend  on Friday.  Yeah.  And he said that was his excuse.  He said, I'm getting married this weekend, so this coming Monday and every Monday for  the foreseeable future, I'll be taking off.  I'm taking my honeymoon every other Monday.  Here's the very important question.  I'm hearing the staff has a ridiculous amount of sick days, vacation days.  Doesn't that mean me and Ann have a lot of days coming to us?  Apparently not.  I don't think so.  Why?  What's the difference? 
[01:18:00]  Don't we have sick days?  We're supposed to have more time off than you guys.  Yeah.  How does that work?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Someone better explain this to me.  And if we have a lot of sick days, we're going to start taking some days.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Well, because they wanted to be very strict because we used to just...  The staff used to just take off when you guys took off.  But then when we got here to Sirius, they said, no, you only have this number of days.  So then we said, okay, well, let's go buy the book, buy the book.  And we looked up how many days we all had. 
[01:18:30]  And we had all accumulated.  Like me, and I've been here less time than these guys.  The company basically fucked themselves.  I have 42 days to take off between now and next June.  Why do you have to use them?  Because then they go away.  Well, they go away.  Do six days go away?  Yes.  Wait, not counting vacation?  No, I have 42 total.  Steve has...  Wait, 42 days is eight weeks.  Yes.  Steve has...  You have eight weeks of vacation in less than a year?  Yes.  By next June, I have to use them all. 
[01:19:00]  What the...  How do we get fucked out of this?  Steve has over 70 days.  70.  That's 7-0.  Over two months.  That's 14 weeks.  Is that considering...  That's almost three months.  That's two and a half months.  But is that also taking into consideration the time that he spends here doing nothing?  Is that added?  Yeah, because he owes us time at this point.  He takes his vacation time, but he comes in.  Right.  So I don't know what that means.  But the company went to these guys like, look, it's not cool that you're taking as much time  off as Opie and Anthony and Jimmy. 
[01:19:30]  Yes.  So these guys were smart enough to go to HR and go, all right, let's look at the books  and see how much time we got.  Crack the books.  And they crack the books, and it's like, oh boy.  So we only have vacation time, and we don't get sick days?  Yeah, you get some sick days.  But other people have vacation and sick days?  I don't know.  We're going to figure this one out.  Because with these guys, we're not going to have a staff, because these guys have to take  their days.  That's what it's coming down to.  Yeah.  Because the new company, sick days, do not roll over.  Like, you don't get to keep your sick days after a year, but because we're XM legacy, 
[01:20:00]  quote unquote.  Legacy.  We have until next June to use all the days, because XM days did carry over.  For how long?  Would XM days carry over forever?  Like, year after year?  Yeah.  That's why we all...  Did you say XM gays or days?  Days.  I might as well share that.  Yes.  XM gays.  Serious as a what?  They stay for that year?  Yeah, you get it for the year, and then they don't...  And then, you know, they replenish...  Like, say if you have five sick days a year, and you use three of them, you don't get the 
[01:20:30]  other two, and you start with five again.  That's weird, because it encourages you to take off.  Like, it's like...  I know.  Yeah.  It says, look, you have X amount.  Take them.  You better take them.  I'm going to find out how many days I got today.  Crack the books.  Let's see.  And if we got a lot, so long.  And they're into some interesting shit.  I got a lot of golf days coming to me.  Fuck that fake golf on TV.  I'm going to play for real.  You guys don't want to take days off.  My stomach hurts.  Aw.  Peter K. from Denver.  Was the first dance song, Zebras, Bears. 
[01:21:00]  A little obscure, but very good for Peter.  Steven asks for Bayshore.  Who was the best man who slipped Steve the cock ring?  Take the wig.  Seriously, is Steve descending into madness?  He sounds like a homoerotic maniac.  Cody in Indiana.  The only reason they had such a cheap wedding is because why waste money on fake weddings?  Hoffman in Virginia.  Wear Steve's tuxedo pants capris.  That's coming in a lot, actually. 
[01:21:30]  A lot.  Craig G. from Pal Talk.  What's the matter?  Gay men's health clinic was closed for the wedding.  Okay.  I wanted to wear white.  Steve.  That many days off, you guys are like teachers.  Welcome to my world, Scott and Hoppog.  That's amazing how many days you guys get.  What the fuck?  I'm going to take a second job for the summer when I'm taking my eight weeks off.  Yeah.  Oh, this just in Coke Logic.  You've got to think back a little bit. 
[01:22:00]  This is in for the newer listeners.  Than never left the show.  He's just been using his sick days.  All right.  Let's say hi to Lydia Oceanside.  Lydia.  Hi, guys.  Hi, Lydia.  Hello.  Hello.  You and your big fat fucking tits.  Alcoholism.  Hi.  Hi, Lydia.  Hello.  Hi.  I just wanted to say that I was at F.H. Riley's Friday night and it was packed. 
[01:22:30]  My goodness.  Was it packed with listeners or my brother just having another solid night with the locals?  I have no idea, but everyone was eating.  You would have an idea if you walked in.  Believe me.  You could tell when it's the regulars that my brother has gotten from the town and if it was a night for the listeners.  It's very obvious, actually.  Yes.  They don't mingle well.  Listeners are very obvious.  Yes.  You could tell.  It must have been locals.  Oh, that's cool.  Yeah.  How's the new design?  I haven't seen it yet in person.  Well, I can tell you it was wonderful because I was there Saturday night. 
[01:23:00]  Were you really?  Yes.  I stopped in there.  I had a little dinner.  Brett hooked me up.  Very nice.  Won't let me pay a goddamn bill.  But, you know, then I took care of the staff.  But, wow.  Really good.  I had that goddamn chicken breast.  And then I had the chicken.  What are those things?  The chicken spring rolls?  Oh, those things are ridiculous.  God damn it.  Fucking ridiculous.  Fuck.  Get me some now.  I need them.  It's the, yeah, the chicken spring.  No, they're buffalo chicken spring rolls. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Spring rolls.  Spring rolls.  And what did Steve from Bayshore do exactly?  What are you talking about?  I noticed there's a lot of wood in that place.  No.  What did he paint?  Oh.  He didn't even finish the painting.  What did he paint?  We felt bad for him.  Did you?  Yeah, we said paint a little bit.  Just paint a little bit?  Like giving a retard some work?  Yeah, and then we'll put wood over your dumb paint job.  Paint out back by the garbage cans.  Paint outdoors.  Exactly.  Paint a couple yellow lines by the garbage so you know where to put it outside.  Okay.  I don't think he really painted. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm looking around going, no, isn't it?  Look, did Steve do?  Isn't it some kind of yellow now?  Not that awful bright in your face like yellow, like a subtle yellow?  Anything that wasn't fine wood looked like primer white to me.  Way to go, Steve.  I don't know what he did.  I'm so glad we hired your talents.  There were some spots that weren't quite finished painting either.  Right.  It looked like a little spackle you could see.  That's because Steve needed a beer.  Beer more important than the paint job, right, Steve?  He put the brush down and picked the old bottle up. 
[01:24:30]  Jesus.  How was the French doors?  You saw the French doors?  Yes.  Were they open for the nice summer air?  Well, it was nighttime.  It was nighttime, so I think they had closed them up.  Really?  Yeah, it must have been cold out.  Yeah, it was a little chill.  Right.  Oh, no, it was a rainy night Saturday.  Yeah, yeah.  Shut the fuck up, you tit monster.  We're trying to have a conversation.  She just keeps yapping.  You need to see a therapist.  Yeah, Needy, Needy, Needy, Needy, Needy, Needy. 
[01:25:00]  Hi, Lydia.  So you were there Friday.  See?  One day different than I could have seen you there.  See?  I'm sorry to be so needy on your face.  You never know.  You never know.  I want to challenge you on your profession.  Me?  Yeah.  What do you mean challenge?  We'll do therapy with the same person and see who helps them better. 
[01:25:30]  You got it down now?  Oh, yeah, I got it down.  Oh, you and I?  Yes.  Who do you have in mind for us to cheat up?  Yeah, we need a subject.  And then we both spend an hour with them and see what we can get done.  I guess you would probably win that competition.  Competition?  I'm fucking with you.  I don't know the first thing about that shit.  Actually, I think you're a pretty good raw talent. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  Pretty astute.  I had to learn a few things growing up.  All right, Lydia.  I guess so.  Lydia, I love you, Lydia.  Okay.  All right.  Love you, too.  Sorry I beat you up.  I was just fucking around.  That's okay.  I can take it.  All right.  Thank you.  She goes with a giant tit.  Oh, before break, I finally went to the Kevin Smith movie set.  Oh, saw the Twitter picture.  Yeah, and Kevin was kind of miserable because he had to direct a car chase.  Yeah.  And he's more of a guy that likes directing dialogue. 
[01:26:30]  Yes.  Which was amazing to me.  I'm like, you're a director of a movie.  See, I so don't know this world.  I'd be excited to go to work that day.  I get to direct a fucking car chase.  Car chase.  But he was like, yeah, this is like easy.  This is easy stuff.  Yeah.  Bruce Willis is hanging out the car shooting.  Tracy Morgan's driving.  The cars are flying right by our location.  And Kevin's like, yeah, this is easy.  I'm like, are you kidding me?  That's how great he is. 
[01:27:00]  Were they using real guns?  Yeah, I think so, Jimmy.  And Tracy Morgan, I Twittered it.  Funniest man on the fucking planet.  Knows how to just fucking take over.  Just fucking took over.  Just riffing for an hour.  Showing everybody a video on his phone of his massive snake eating a pregnant rat.  Oh, God.  That's not what made him funny.  But he held court with that shit.  But I didn't know when to stop listening to him. 
[01:27:30]  And because of that, I missed an opportunity to fucking meet Bruce Willis.  Oh, no.  You just got to walk away from him.  Kenny, Tracy's holding court, holding court, holding court.  A lot of laughs, a lot of laughs, a lot of laughs.  And then it finally ends.  And clubster to Kenny goes, you missed Bruce Willis.  And I'm like, where was he?  He was 10 feet away from you.  And he was debating if he should interrupt and talk to Tracy and say hi to you guys.  I'm like, Kenny, you couldn't tap me and get my attention? 
[01:28:00]  When am I going to get a chance to meet Bruce Willis again?  Yeah.  I'll introduce you to him.  Oh, really?  Well, you did a scene with him, Jimmy.  I don't know him, though.  Hey, is that him to the left in that picture?  Who was that?  The bald guy.  It looks like Bruce looking at the dailies.  No, no.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.  That's, you know, no.  The car chase flew right by, obviously, from left to right in the picture I tweeted.  It was awesome to check out.  I had a lot of fun.  I was there four and a half hours.  They filmed three scenes.  No, one scene three times and another scene once. 
[01:28:30]  And they rolled tape for maybe a total of two minutes.  Yeah.  Four and a half hours.  And then in editing, that'll be cut down to about 30 seconds.  Oh, yeah.  Maybe.  And they had a film, a scene where, like, the windshield, like, gets hit by a, you know,  bullet.  And they got it on the first take.  I'm like, get the fuck out of here.  How'd they get?  Because they had, like, a million windshields just waiting on the side of the fucking, you  know, street.  Oh, shit.  To fix up the car with another windshield if they missed the shot. 
[01:29:00]  Wow.  And they had a little squib or whatever they're fucking called, right?  Yeah.  A little squib thing.  Isn't it amazing how they do that?  It's like all this work goes in, and all of a sudden they'll go, speed, rolling, and  then they'll be doing something, and then something got fucked up because a light didn't work.  Or there was something, well, we hear something, and they have to stop the whole production.  Yeah, stop everything.  How everything can get shut down by one minor.  That's why movies cost millions upon millions of dollars.  They shouldn't be that expensive. 
[01:29:30]  These are all union guys.  Yeah.  Yep.  It was awesome.  I want to thank Kevin Smith.  It was a lot of fun.  You should go back when they're doing dialogue, when they're doing like an interior scene.  They invited me back.  They only got like four weeks of filming left.  I'm going back in two weeks to see some dialogue because they're doing nights right now.  It's cool to watch them trip or to watch them redo it or to go, all right, let's go again,  and then get to go back and do the same thing from a different angle.  When you watch how exact they are, it's amazing.  It's amazing that business.  To direct a movie, to me, just seems like the biggest undertaking ever.  A movie business.  Yeah.  And then there were Make-A-Wish kids there from Australia. 
[01:30:00]  Oh, really?  That was pulling on the heartstrings.  Whenever you hear Make-A-Wish, you're like, oh, boy.  That means not much hope left.  Does it wish to see Kevin Smith make a movie?  I guess.  Or see Bruce Willis make a movie?  I don't know.  But Bruce couldn't have been nicer to them.  What's he going to do?  Smack a little cancer kid?  He's taking pictures with the Make-A-Wish kids.  I wasn't going to go up there, although I was going to fuck up my hair a little bit  and walk over and see if he would have noticed. 
[01:30:30]  You should have coughed and asked for a picture.  I was this close to doing something.  Kenny, just throw a lot of water on my face.  Yeah, I have a fever.  I miss it.  This is Gregorio.  Sweet boy.  He's very sick.  He's from Nicaragua.  Nicaragua.  Yes, he has toe thumbs.  He needs help.  Yes.  Yes.  All right, why don't we break?  We've got to talk about the dummy that fell in the manhole. 
[01:31:00]  Best story over the weekend.  Yeah.  And we've got a little audio.  That was me.  No, not that type of manhole, Steve.  And other things.  I don't know.  We'll figure it out after the break.  Opie and Anthony.  And now, backstage with O&A, here is Primetime Sam Roberts.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and it was brought up on the Opie and Anthony show that executive  producer Steve C. is faking sick and taking days off like there's no tomorrow. 
[01:31:30]  We went to Steve himself to get to the bottom of things.  Steve, the guys say that you take too many sick days.  What's going on?  I know you think I'm faking it, but believe me, it would be a lot easier just to call  out than to fucking orchestrate an elaborate scheme.  Why is your immune system so weak?  AIDS.  Do you think you're taking more sick days than anybody else?  Not at all.  No more sick days than anyone else? 
[01:32:00]  Apparently, Opie and Anthony's opinion of the days Steve takes off are skewed.  We found the Opie and Anthony interns and asked all of them who takes the most sick days.  Who do you think takes the most sick days out of the O&A staff?  So far, definitely Steve.  I think Steve.  That would be Steve Carlisi.  Probably Steve.  I'd say Steve.  Um, Steve?  Uh, I would say probably Steve Carlisi.  A room full of idiot interns can't be wrong. 
[01:32:30]  Why is Steve faking sick every day?  Has the pressure finally gotten to him?  Luckily for us, Steve being absent from the show has literally no effect on how it sounds.  Feel better, Steve.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and this has been...  Backstage with ONA.  Opie and Anthony, Rich Voss, and Bonnie are going to be in studio in a few minutes here.  The happily married couple.  Oh, yeah.  They got a film crew today, too.  What are they filming? 
[01:33:00]  Uh, Bonnie's documentary.  Ah!  On women.  And whether or not they're funny.  Yeah, come on in, Rich.  Is that it?  Damn.  Rich is standing by the door like a puppy.  Rich has nothing to do.  Can I come in?  You have nothing to do because Bonnie's filming some stuff down the hall.  Well, uh, first of all...  She's emasculating you by actually doing a program?  Uh, I have a lot to do, but we'll discuss Bonnie when she gets in here.  Uh, I have a lot to do. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah?  Yeah, like what?  Like?  What do you mean?  In business or in life?  I thought that sounded like you were ready to make an announcement.  Oh, uh, I thought it was like...  Oh, okay.  No, it's like, I have a lot to do, and here it is.  No, it's just okay.  I have a lot to do, and...  You know, in life and stuff, you know, I just have a lot.  You know, and my plate is full.  That's what I'm saying.  Ah, well, yeah.  You're golfing a lot.  Oh, too much.  Well, I went on vacation last week with my kids.  I took my older daughters on vacation. 
[01:34:00]  To Miami.  What are you, insane?  Why?  Why would that be insane?  Because you've got good-looking daughters.  What do you think?  I'm letting them run free?  There's a lot of cotton down there.  Huh?  Oh, my God.  I know that.  And a lot of grandmas, but...  You know, we went out to dinner.  The hot spot in Miami is the Fountain Blue now.  The Fountain Blue?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Who's the fountain?  I've stayed at the Fountain Blue. 
[01:34:30]  Have you?  Since it's been, like, cool, or back in the day?  You know, back in the day when they were filming fucking James Bond there.  No.  The Fountain Blue has probably been the place to be for a decade.  No, now it's really the place to be.  Oh, really?  In a decade?  For a decade it's been the place to be?  I don't know.  I'm guessing.  It has been a pretty cool place to be.  It just happened to become the place to be in the last couple months or year.  It was.  I believe...  And really, I think that scene from what?  Goldfinger was filmed there?  Or was it another Bond movie? 
[01:35:00]  Oh.  I'm not sure, but...  Well, yeah.  I mean, the Rat Pack, everybody used to play the Fountain Blue.  Yeah, sure.  You know, that's where I started.  And...  That's when you started.  What's that?  That's when you started.  The Fountain Blue?  No, but the Rat Pack.  Oh.  That was the joke.  I think you said...  I'm sorry.  I think you said that's where I started.  Please don't touch me.  You're right.  Bonnie's outside.  Does she need a big entrance, or does she, like...  Ah, there's Bonnie.  I don't know.  Now that she's a big star.  Look at her, is she intentionally trying to, like, yuck it up? 
[01:35:30]  No.  She, uh...  Does she do a little more in front of the camera than usual?  Hi, Bonnie.  Do you play to the camera a little bit more than you would if you were just walking around?  No, she doesn't overact.  No?  She makes Norton look like an under-actor.  Mm-hmm.  I'm a very good actor.  I heard that.  If you would have seen Z-Rock last night, you would have known it.  Oh, getting rave reviews, Jimmy.  That's what I...  Yes.  I meant to mention that as we came back, everyone loving you on Z-Rock last night.  Oh, good, thank you.  I got to see it.  Don't tell me how it ends.  What's Z-Rock? 
[01:36:00]  It's a wrestling show?  On IFC.  No.  No, it's not a wrestling show.  What is it?  It's a show on IFC.  Rich, you know the show.  Oh, that one?  Yeah.  Oh, you mean...  How did that...  Wait.  How did that...  How did that tip off to him?  You know the show.  Oh, that one.  Because he only knows one show.  And it's her different tones.  It was that easy to...  Wow, she's learned how to figure you out.  I love how we make her sit way in the corner, by the way. 
[01:36:30]  No, that's cool.  I get it.  You know.  I get it.  It's a boy's club.  We put her in the chair like last time she was in here.  Yeah.  Now we stick her in the corner.  Well, she was in that chair because she had the baby.  You know?  And that's the kind of chair you sit with a baby.  Is it?  Do you want to sit with the big boys or do you want to just sit all alone over there?  That's okay.  You guys just be funny and I'll laugh.  Smart ass.  Hey, will you not hit the cameraman with the door? 
[01:37:00]  Oh, I'm sorry.  Were you filming something?  Now, Bonnie.  Yes?  What is this that you're filming?  We're making a cockumentary.  A cockumentary?  Yeah.  Never heard the word documentary butchered like that.  Oh, I have.  It's a comedy documentary.  A rock documentary.  Yes.  A comedy documentary.  See?  Huh.  A cockumentary.  A cockumentary.  Oh, here he goes.  Kenny almost slammed him again.  Kenny, what are you doing, Kenny?  Kenny is the worst.  God.  Or the best. 
[01:37:30]  Thank you.  You just brought me my sandwich.  Of course.  The sandwich is more important than the filming of the cockumentary.  And not only the filming, but I'm not like a filmer, but these would be-  A filmer.  A filmer.  What the hell is a filmer?  A guy that does the filming.  Oh.  Camera off?  A cameraman.  A camera off.  A camera off.  They're more important to get on camera than her.  Why?  Because they're Opie and Anthony.  She's just Bonnie.  And Jim Norton.  Oh, and Norton.  I didn't mean anything about-  Oh, no.  Please. 
[01:38:00]  This is the worst.  You really are the worst.  So what exactly is this?  It's about-  What is the documentary?  I'm on a quest to find out if women are really funny or not.  You know, kind of like the last day in it.  We can sum that up in about three frames.  No.  No women?  Because, you know, maybe I have been fooling myself all this time.  No, I'll say the percentage drops way off as far as funny women to funny men. 
[01:38:30]  If you're talking, and I think that's just in general.  You know, comedians especially, guy comics get up there, it's like, all right, I can watch this.  The second a woman comic gets up there, I'm like, oh boy, this is going to suck ass.  Are you kidding?  You actually think that.  Yeah, I do.  You think as they're walking to the stage?  As they're going to the stage, I'm like, fuck, why is there a woman on the goddamn bill?  Oh no!  But, sometimes I'm pleasantly surprised that she's hot.  Oh, so you think it's- 
[01:39:00]  No, no, no.  Sometimes I am surprised that they are actually funny.  It's just they follow quite the same outline of, you know.  Me and Oprah have talked about this before, where it's like the same fucking, all right,  the, oh, your mom wants you to find a guy, but I can't find the right guy, and am I getting  fat, and I'm too old to have kids, and it's like, oh, shut up.  It's like you're reading my set list.  Oh, I know.  Period jokes, rule.  Period jokes.  No, I like girls that are a little skanky up there, you know, get a little raw. 
[01:39:30]  You like dirty.  I like a little dirty, but not like to the point where they're just doing it because  they're a girl and they're being dirty.  It's a fine line girls have to tread to be funny up on stage, and then just in normal  life, hanging out, girls normally aren't as funny as just a bunch of guys hanging out.  Women who are very funny are women who embrace or exhibit personality qualities that are typically  attributed to men.  Yes.  Like, they're not afraid.  Like, that's why you're funny offstage and onstage, because you break balls. 
[01:40:00]  It's like-  I have a hemorrhoid.  Yeah, the boy, I mean, that's what makes you sexy.  Not just-  I'm not judgmental on the guys.  I don't have fat lips.  You call it a hemorrhoid, I call it a speed bump.  But no, it's women that aren't afraid.  Those qualities that, like, guys, we're not afraid to make asses out of ourselves, or to  be brutal, or like you said, being judgmental with certain subjects.  And women that embrace those qualities are just as-  Like, Joan Rivers, to me, is as funny and as brutal as any male stand-up has ever been. 
[01:40:30]  Ever.  I've never seen anybody do as brutal a set as I saw Joan Rivers do a couple of years  ago.  You're blocking my shot.  It's like, um-  There we go.  It's like, uh, maybe I'll duck down like this, too, so I look like a real tiger, probably.  But it's like, you think about women-  It's a stand-up you watch Joan Rivers, and she was doing age jokes, and 9-11 jokes, and  just, like, brutal fucking-  So anyone not afraid to embrace those qualities, I think-  Well, who does Bonnie, guys?  Also, too, though, Joan Rivers is established, and she doesn't care now, like a new comic 
[01:41:00]  wouldn't do-  She never cared.  She never cared.  She never cared.  No.  I don't care.  She's a fat pig.  No.  Stop trying to tag the brilliance of Jimmy.  She never cared.  I was asking.  He summed up the whole Joan Rivers thing.  You didn't need to add to that.  But if she was so funny, why did her husband kill himself?  Well-  That is true.  I think it was because he felt-  No, you're actually asking a funny question.  I'm going to give you a serious answer.  Way to ruin the joke, Jim.  Yell at him now.  No, you're right.  I caught myself- 
[01:41:30]  No, what I was mad about, you said that she has nothing to lose anymore.  Her whole act was-  She went-  Right from the beginning?  Yes!  Yeah, Joan-  She couldn't say pregnant on Ed Sullivan.  She used to get pissed off because she couldn't say pregnant and all that, and they censored  her.  I wasn't trying to-  I want to ask Bonnie who she finds funny, as far as female comics go.  Um, I think Jimmy-  I mean-  No.  Come on.  Um, I don't know.  I don't know.  Oh, you don't want to answer that because-  Wow.  Because that's what you're exploring with your cockumentary. 
[01:42:00]  Yes.  Yes.  I find a lot of women funny.  Who do I think is funny?  I can't-  Uh, Jessica Kirsten, you think is funny?  She's hilarious.  She makes me laugh in a way that, like, it's like a drug, where you don't even know why  you're laughing anymore.  You're just kind of like-  Lisa Lampanelli.  Funny?  Uh-  Or shocking?  No, neither.  Well, what-  Neither?  No, wait.  After you saw her HBO-  After I saw Lisa Lampanelli's HBO special, I did question whether I wanted to be a comic  or not. 
[01:42:30]  Why?  I just felt like it was that-  It was so simple-minded, and that people were loving it so much.  I could-  I don't know.  It just-  I was like-  I was afraid that I might be a little bit like that, and I didn't want to-  I didn't want to, like-  But love black cock?  No.  Well, we all do.  Sure.  Come on, let's be honest, guys.  Wait, but didn't you say that it makes you- that you don't even want to be a racist anymore?  Oh, yeah.  Which I told you-  When I watched her, I did. 
[01:43:00]  I was like, I don't- I don't know- I'm not going to be a racist anymore, because it's  just-  It didn't really work.  What female- do you think there's a female comic that could have done the virus-  Ah!  The virus to her?  You know who does-  Holy shit.  Well, that's a whole different crowd.  I think it could have been the funniest woman ever that stepped up there, and they would  have gotten fucking crucified.  It would have been a tough spot for any female comic.  Amy Schumer works with me on the road.  She kills in front of my crowds, typically ONA crowds, and she does great.  She doesn't change what she does. 
[01:43:30]  She's very funny.  I saw her recently.  She's really funny.  She's doing Bondi.  I like-  Huh?  She does Bondi.  Oh, really?  Well, a little bit.  You don't think?  No.  I'm doing it again.  Oh, look at that.  Oh, my God.  What do you think about that?  I don't- I don't know.  I've really- I've seen her very little.  I like Amy Schumer a lot when she's just out and about.  I like it when she's around.  She's funny.  She gets it.  I like the makeup on Bondi.  It's like, your little eye makeup.  She's looking.  She knows she's on camera.  I could be funny, but I could be sexy.  You guys, I still like to- I'm a girl. 
[01:44:00]  Still be down.  I talk about it in my act.  Yeah.  I put my makeup on the night before.  Is that what you did there?  It's smeared around on the pillow.  Yeah.  I like that slut eye thing.  Thank you.  You know, when girls wake up and they got-  No, I'm not saying you have it.  But when girls wake up and their mascara's all, like, fucked up in their eyes, that's  kind of cool.  It's hot.  Sexy.  Yeah, because you like- you probably enjoy- do you like porn where the girl looks like  she's about to cry? 
[01:44:30]  No, no.  Not because of pain or anything like that.  No, no, no.  But, like, me, like, oh, God, I have to pay some bills and this is, like, the last-  No, no.  I like the ones that are about to cry because of the experience was so beautiful.  Don't forget it here.  I actually like a porno with a girl.  She's got two cocks in her hand and she calls one rent and one car payment.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sexy.  What has my life come to? 
[01:45:00]  Like one of those deep blowjobs, a good teary blowjobs.  I like the ones that don't have manicures and stuff.  Like, it just happened that day where somebody was like, come on, let's do this.  It's the worst to watch porn with.  Like, she'll go, oh, like, too many close-ups.  If you get a close-up of a pussy, like that, or, you know, just a good, like, cock-sucking.  Like, everything grosses around.  She goes, there's no storyline.  Why are you watching it?  I didn't say there's no story.  I've never seen it.  I'm Citizen Kane, then.  What are you doing?  No, no.  You know what?  I think I would enjoy porn radio. 
[01:45:30]  I like the sounds.  The sounds.  I just don't like the visuals.  Well, we had a few of those.  It's too close.  We could get a couple to have sex for you guys right now on the phone.  Yeah, I think we did this one time.  When you were in?  Yeah.  We have some sexy clips, though.  Yeah, because the guy said some funny things.  In the middle of it?  Yeah.  It was like two strangers having phone sex.  So where are you guys at with the cockumentary?  Why do you call it that?  It's so dumb.  It sounds dumb.  It's a documentary. 
[01:46:00]  Cockumentary?  What's a comedy?  Well, because I think it works on two levels.  Like, it's a comedy documentary, so it's kind of a funny name.  And then you're in it.  What's Rich's part in the documentary?  Or the cockumentary?  He's just himself.  He's, you know, he micromanaged.  He tries to micromanage what I'm doing.  How does he do that?  He tells me I'm doing everything wrong all the time and how to do it right.  Does he ever offer his opinion when you just kind of are not really interested in hearing it? 
[01:46:30]  Like, does he just come over and just start telling you things you don't want to hear about?  Yeah, absolutely.  You know what he does do all the time?  And he does this with everything, not just this cockumentary.  I won't stop calling it that.  It's so stupid.  Go ahead.  He tries to inject himself.  You know, he's like, well, I should be doing the interviews.  It's like, well, I'm doing this documentary.  And then he's like trying to figure out a way to get in.  No, I'm not trying to.  Yes, you're constantly asking to do the interviews.  You're like Desi Arnaz and he's Lucy. 
[01:47:00]  He's trying to get into the show.  He's juicy.  One time I was up for this, hosting this weird reality show thing.  And when he found that out, he was like, well, you've got to tell him I'd be good on it, too.  The two of us.  Like, I'm not even kidding.  I'm not even kidding.  No, I wasn't banging.  When I said I wasn't going to, I was like, Rich, I don't even have the job.  I just auditioned for it. 
[01:47:30]  They called to say they liked me.  You know, whatever.  They were taking it to the network.  He was like, but I, he goes, you've got to tell him.  And he got, we had a huge fight because I refused to go.  The next time I had to go in, I refused to go.  You know, you should change your format just a little bit so that my husband can also be on the show.  So instead of just being happy for you that you were doing well with something.  He had to be a self-centered ass.  And then he always brings up, I got you on O&A.  No, first of all, no. 
[01:48:00]  He helped me.  I've helped you through.  Listen, when I found you, you were reading a piece of paper on a stool at Embar.  Okay?  And I had friends.  I knew.  Wait, you knew her before Last Comic Standing?  No.  Not really.  That's when I met her, when I was doing Last Comic Standing.  When I could have fucking been tagging anybody around the country.  So you met her when she was doing a network TV show.  No.  Yeah.  But you were going to claim that she was a nobody.  Actually, he did tell me to go on Last Comic Standing.  I was doing the show.  Well, that's what I'm asking.  Did you guys meet before Last Comic Standing?  When he was on it.  He was on the first season. 
[01:48:30]  On my season.  And then I was on the second season.  Okay.  But you guys knew each other before.  No, I didn't.  No, she came up to me.  I'm so confused.  Anyone?  No, I remember it.  So when I was on Last Comic, she came up to me at the cellar when I was on season one.  Okay.  And then just two nights later, I was eating her fucking box in a car.  Does that wear a body?  For a second.  I didn't let it go on that long.  You just see a little trace?  You were sitting in the passenger seat and he was what?  Like just standing on the floor kind of peeking over the seat? 
[01:49:00]  He was peeking out with me and then he just went for it.  What were you wearing then?  It was so easy.  I was wearing a skirt.  A hazmat suit.  You go from kissing to just right down?  Yeah, he went.  I had to catch a flight, didn't I see you?  He just wanted me there so we could kill time and so they had to go get his flight.  Is there anything hotter than pulling those panties aside though, huh?  Right, Bonnie?  Panties with panties.  Panties for it.  Pull those panties aside and just go down. 
[01:49:30]  So anyhow, I've gotten her.  You're hanging out with the boys today, Bonnie.  Yeah, no, that's cool, guys.  I asked her about one dumb show and she doesn't tell you the whole story.  I'm working on my slobber.  We want to hear more about the pussy eating.  Yeah.  We're not ready to move on, Rich.  No, we have questions.  I'm backing up to where you guys attacked me.  Thank you, Bonnie.  Help me out.  After kissing him for a few minutes, my entire body was already wet.  You know what I mean? 
[01:50:00]  Is he a good kisser?  Back then, I'm sure he's not kissing anymore.  I haven't kissed in years, but he was a good kisser and it really did have to do with how  much juice he has in his mouth.  It made it good.  Really?  Yeah, it made it kind of sloppy.  Someone has to ask, how's his breath?  No, he has...  Rich doesn't have bad breath.  With all that gentle work and all that shit.  He brushes his teeth like once a week and he still has the most amazing breath.  And you know why?  I read a thing.  You know, drug addicts, they get their teeth go bad and they have really bad breath. 
[01:50:30]  It's because they don't have enough saliva in their mouth.  They get dry mouth.  And Rich just overproduces it.  Oh, so it's like a car wash in there.  Yes.  Yeah.  Just constantly bathing.  Yeah, I don't think I've ever smelled of Ross having bad breath.  No.  And you guys have been intimate.  Never that close, but close enough.  Get that drug dealer washed his cock then if you've never had bad breath.  It went from eating pussy to my breath.  If someone is telling me to get it right, it's pussy diving.  I'm sorry. 
[01:51:00]  We learned that on Friday.  All right.  He did.  He dived and then came back up with a fish.  How many minutes of the pussy diving in the car?  No, it's literally less than a minute.  No, it wasn't less than a minute.  Yeah, no, because I was like, oh, I'm not that kind of girl.  Remember I was playing that?  I'm not that kind of girl.  Fuck me in the ass.  Only for a second.  That's all it took.  No, see, now you're doing great.  I just got pissed off at the Joan Rivers thing. 
[01:51:30]  Oh, you did?  All right.  Sorry.  Because he did well at that.  I know I am.  I know.  What is your point with the documentary?  You think women are funny?  I mean, you obviously are.  So what are you saying with it?  You don't think they are or you're sick of the perception that they're not?  I'm not.  I don't.  It's hard for me to really give a shit at all.  I just want to do something.  Good thing you're passionate about what you're making a documentary about.  I really don't give a shit about this.  I don't care.  I just need it.  I don't think she wants to answer any of those questions. 
[01:52:00]  She wants the film to herself in.  I want to try to have some kind of...  You don't want to go into this with an opinion, I would assume.  Right.  I mean, you probably do have an opinion.  I do.  But you don't want to say that right out of the box, obviously.  That's the big reveal.  I want to keep my journalistic integrity.  That's why I'm producing this.  I'm directing these.  Thank you.  I love these puppets.  Thank you for stepping in.  Oh, look at Kenny coming through the door.  Kenny, what the fuck?  Now, Kenny's bringing my snack.  I'm trying to eat a little better.  Snick snack?  Low fat peanut butter.  Rice cakes and peanut butter. 
[01:52:30]  Yum.  Peanut butter is your...  That's a step up.  Reduce fat.  Jif stinks.  I wanted the other stuff.  They don't have it?  Oh, no.  Oh, I think Jif is the best.  Reduce fat?  Yeah.  Why do you say that?  It tastes best.  Damn it.  Taste...  I'm worried about my fat tits in my stomach.  Peanut butter wouldn't be the thing...  Well, they're all kind of comparable, aren't they?  Well, I'm eating...  I want some low fat.  Isn't it low fat?  25% less fat than peanut butter.  Oh, that's not good.  Well, don't put a half a pound on it.  I don't.  I only eat a little bit, Rich.  You know what, though?  There's good fats and there's bad fats, and you're a bad fat. 
[01:53:00]  All right, let's get back to the pussy diving, so...  Okay.  No, then what happened with the relationship after the pussy diving, Rich?  I never heard the beginnings of the Rich and Bonnie relationship.  Oh.  Well, I was still filming last comic, the first season, the finals, and I was like...  Did she think you were a big star?  Did she have that look in her eye?  No, she just fucked up all.  She fucked Brad Pitt.  One time, for a second. 
[01:53:30]  No.  I told him that so that he...  She said Brad Pitt hit on her in a club.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Or someone who looked like Brad Pitt.  I don't know.  And to me, if Brad Pitt really hit on her, how could you not fuck him?  Like, if you're a woman.  So you don't believe her?  It's here with my theory on it, is that...  This is my theory, is that I could be the girl that...  Fuck Brad Pitt, every girl would do that.  Or he'd have to constantly be like, that one girl that turned me down.  Yeah, but you're also the girl who fucks Rich Voss. 
[01:54:00]  But see, my theory on that was, I'll be the one girl who does fuck him.  Did Brad Pitt really hit on you, though?  I don't know for sure if it was.  It looked like him, and then people called him Brad.  Wait, you really don't know if it was him?  How do you not know if it's Brad Pitt?  Well, because I thought it was him then, but then after thinking about it, it seems ridiculous  that it was him.  Where was it?  It was in a bar in...  In a bar that's...  I can't remember the name of it, but it's right next to the Laugh Factory in L.A. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, that fancy one where all the stars go?  It wasn't that.  How much of a Midwestern housewife could you have sounded like when you asked that question?  That fancy one where all the movie stars go?  Is that the one with the celeb-y tongue?  Jesus, Aunt Richard.  All right, so she could have had sex with Brad Pitt.  You're filming Last Comic Standing.  Let's go.  Okay.  Then what happened?  And then she came up to me at the cellar, and so we started fooling around, and then...  Not then. 
[01:55:00]  No.  You stalked me a little bit.  No.  I got her a number.  I tried to get her a number, and then the next...  Whatever, and then, you know, if I was in L.A., I'd call her, you know.  She was great, because I had a hotel when I was filming.  I was in L.A., and she came over to the hotel, and all I had to do was, like, she left her  water over on a table or something, or a drink.  I'd go, let me get that for you.  What a gentleman.  I thought he was being a gentleman.  So, I fucked her in a hotel.  I fucked her, right?  Okay, but I left my car in a zone, parking spot, where I knew I had to go back out in 
[01:55:30]  an hour and a half, so that I could have an excuse to be like, ooh, let me get the car.  And if you get murdered, they'll be wondering where the girl that owns the car is.  Well, all I know is, after I fucked her, she left immediately.  Really?  It was great.  I mean, I didn't have to sit and talk with her.  Oh, you think it's great?  He's probably like, ah.  No, no.  Back then, I was really eligible.  You know, I was...  I have to say this, that he, like, when we went into his hotel room, and he realized 
[01:56:00]  we were going to have sex, he immediately stripped down completely naked.  And he...  I was kind of shocked that you had such a good body.  Yeah, my foot was...  Wow.  I was tighter then.  And I knew she was coming over.  As Jim Norton is.  She was coming over.  He does look very good naked.  He put some weight on since he quit smoking.  I didn't put any...  A few pounds.  We all see it, Dredge.  A few pounds.  It's all right.  It's nothing, dude.  It's okay.  Don't worry about it.  You look good.  You look good. 
[01:56:30]  Did he take time to make sure...  He's 76 years old, you guys.  When did you get your abs back?  How do we all know how he looks naked?  He has a Jack LaLanne body.  It's sickening.  Jack LaLanne.  How the fuck do we all know when you look like naked?  Yeah, you have Lois Lane.  Dude, you got, like, an eight pack.  Lois LaLanne.  You're pushing 60, right?  Yeah.  I turned 52 two years after you guys broke my arm on June 30th.  Oh, yeah.  So we did that.  Who cares?  I know.  Did he, like, tend to your needs? 
[01:57:00]  I knew she was coming that day.  It wasn't bad.  It was an enjoyable experience.  It was a little afternoon romp.  I fucking took a Viagra.  I knew she was coming.  I took a half a Viagra.  I ate her fucking pussy.  I fucked her.  My dick was harder than a...  You know what I'm saying?  What do you think Viagra does?  It gets you a dick hard.  I have.  Your dick was harder than...  I had a freak's reference.  Harder than a what's the difficult...  I'm sure that Bonnie...  It would have been the same experience.  Yeah, I'm sure Bonnie is happy that your dick was hard because of the Viagra and not because of her. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, yeah.  That's just wonderful.  No, she was hot back then.  Oh, Christ.  Come on.  You have no idea what you got.  I laugh.  I laugh on the outside.  You have no idea what you got.  Did you get completely naked?  Did you leave some clothes on?  I don't remember what...  You know.  Well, you had a bathing suit.  It was easy to take off, right?  Yeah.  I was wearing a bikini.  Oh.  Because we were out at the pool where he got my water for me.  Wow.  It was nice.  It was good.  He posed a lot at the pool, I remember. 
[01:58:00]  I remember never talking, just being like, okay, let's let this guy hang himself.  And then...  And he would just kind of prance around and pose.  Was he charming?  Not particularly.  Yeah, I don't think so.  I remember thinking, well, if he's good at...  If he's...  You know, it could be fun, sexual thing.  You were just...  It seems to me like you were just a little horned up and needed some dick.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Bonnie's good like that.  Not you, Rich, but okay.  Rich was like, yeah, horned up and need some dick. 
[01:58:30]  No, Rich, we're not talking about you.  So, but this kind of relationship went on for a while where I'd see him in New York or he'd be in L.A. and whatever.  Yeah, you'd hook up.  And then one night...  I'm sure I've told you guys this story.  I don't want to bore you.  No, go ahead.  But we're filming it, so, you know.  One night, I was bored and a little lonely, I guess, so I called him.  And he was on the road.  And he...  Because we never talked, we just sort of, like, would hook up.  He assumed that I wanted phone sex, so... 
[01:59:00]  Nice assumption.  He just went right into it.  And then I didn't want to be like, oh, I just killed a tuck.  Like, I didn't want to be that girl, so I went into it.  And then, um...  Holy shit, Rich, these two rules.  I know.  And then, halfway through, he was, you know, yammering on the scenario.  And he goes, you have one of the best-tasting pussies.  And I remember thinking, it's a fantasy. 
[01:59:30]  You can't give me the best-tasting pussy.  Right, one of them.  You're one of a long list.  Yeah, so I had to be like, shove it out, push it down, keep going, like, you know.  That's great.  What a sexy thing to say.  Your pussy doesn't stink as bad as most of them.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  You smooth-tongue.  But then, after we were done, I made fun of him for that, and we started laughing.  Ah, that's it.  And we talked for a couple of hours.  I used to talk to her, like, I probably, on one phone call back then, talked to her longer 
[02:00:00]  than I've talked to her in the last year.  I mean, we used to talk for, like, two hours sometimes.  Really?  I used to, and then she did Last Comic Standing 2, and it was kind of a night, she hated  it, you know.  I talked her into it, kind of.  I said, do it, you know, because it was a good experience for me, but I didn't know that  they would throw her under the bus and, you know, turn her into, like, the bitch on the  show.  You know what I mean? 
[02:00:30]  I didn't know it was that bad.  And, uh, all right, so, you know, I talked to her a lot and talked her down, and then  in just, then we got, you know, started dating a little, and then, then, you know, as we  were going out, we got the pilot for Comedy Central, which I have with, oh, no, I don't  have one.  And we got the pilot, so I go, well, if the show gets picked up, I might as well get  engaged, you know, for the TV show.  And then it didn't get picked up, and I couldn't take the fucking ring back.  So that's what the marriage is based on. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Well, on my side of it.  New Wallach saying no.  Wait, let's see her side of it.  My side of it was.  Because I'm sure she could defend herself.  No, he had the Oscar gift bag.  So when he asked me to marry him, I, I'm going to say no to all that.  We didn't hear enough about that Oscar goddamn gift bag.  Holy shit.  Cool.  Free stuff, it's great.  When he was, when we was in L.A. one time, we were driving around, and I was telling  him, I was saying, this is at the height of his, like, last comic standing, I guess, 
[02:01:30]  you know, the summer where he was on tour and stuff, and I said, we can, you can never  tell anyone about us.  Oh, shit.  That was nice to hear.  And as, as I said it, this truck drove up and was like, Rich Vance!  So perfect.  Now, has Rich changed?  Did you get married at all?  Yeah, you know, when we, before we got married, people would always go, he's, he's happier  now.  I don't know what you did to him.  He's like a different person.  And I remember thinking, he's such an asshole.  How bad could it have been? 
[02:02:00]  You know what I mean?  Before, but I thought it was kind of a joke.  But now that the true ass has come out, you know, he really is a depressing asshole.  Yeah.  He's, he's horrible.  It's a nightmare.  No, because you're fucking, every time, like, if I come home, if I'm not, whoo, she goes,  oh, look, you're in a bad mood, but I'm not in a bad mood, but now I'm in a bad mood  because you put me in a bad mood by saying I'm in a bad, you know what I'm saying?  Like, they'll push your buttons, you know, like, like, I, I'm not Mr. Outgoing, Mr. 
[02:02:30]  Zoval, you know?  Oh, no.  What'd you say?  Hit the wall.  Get, get, get that on the wall.  They actually said it right.  What did he say?  Zoval.  Right.  That's right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  I thought you said something else.  No, that's actually correct.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, then, Rich.  It doesn't go up on the wall.  So, you know, he's in a bad mood.  Like, if I go play golf, I come home.  I'm not going to be dancing.  That doesn't make you happy.  So, she triggers a lot of stuff.  Like, we had a fight the other night, and she said, everybody hates you. 
[02:03:00]  Did she say that?  That was when they were making up.  I was trying to say, I'm not the only person who thinks you're an asshole.  I thought that was a private phone call.  But it's true.  That's your character.  You know, everyone I ever meet is like, oh, God, he's an asshole.  Like, it's funny.  You know, ha-ha.  But you're so Canadian and passive, or passive, that, like, I don't, I'm tired.  I don't have patience to put up with fucking, uh, passive, Canadian, instead of passive-aggressive. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah, what are you talking about?  See, they let everything slide, don't worry, this and that.  I don't have time for incompetence, you know, with people.  Do you know what I'm saying?  I'm at a point where, you know, if I'm paying for something, I want what I pay for.  So, like, let it slide.  You are abrasive, though.  Like, we were getting coffee outside, and the guy's making the cup, but he's putting his fucking hands in the cup.  Like, some smelly foreigner, I go, do you think maybe you can make my coffee without putting your hand in the cup? 
[02:04:00]  No, no, no, no, that's not what you said.  You said, don't put your hand in my cup.  And I said, you're right, you're right, but, like, that's the thing, is, like, that just, other people have other ways of doing that.  I gotta agree with Rich on this one, though.  But he's terrible at saying it.  He's right, is what he's saying.  You know what it is?  The thing is, like, he makes people want to...  There's no nice way to say that.  Yeah.  It's just, hey, get your fucking filthy hands out of my cup.  All right, that's...  Like, that situation, but if he's saying that, like, you know, if he walks into maybe a hospital 
[02:04:30]  and says, hey, you know, I cut my fucking finger, could you stitch it up, bitch?  But that's how...  No.  He uses that...  That same attitude?  Yeah.  No, thank you.  It's a tone.  See, you think a tone is, you know, is a personality.  It's a tone.  You know what I mean?  No.  Neither do I.  I'm just saying, because I'm from New Jersey, and we're more aggressive.  So...  It's sad what this relationship has become. 
[02:05:00]  How are we going to get back to the pussy diving stage?  Yeah.  Because something has gone drastically wrong.  Bring a friend.  When was the last time you went down on her?  Yeah.  Oh, I always ask to go down on her.  Oh, Barney doesn't want anymore.  Yeah, so you want me to go down on you, and she's like, no, no.  It's just because she's getting it from somebody else.  No big deal.  We do have...  When we have sex, it's good.  I just want him to not talk so I can get in another place.  Just...  Wait, how does he talk? 
[02:05:30]  During sex, you mean?  Or what do you mean?  Like, he talks during sex?  Yeah.  Well, he'll just say dumb shit.  You know, he's rich.  That's rich, yeah.  What does he say that's dumb, though?  I don't know.  I can't think of...  Come on.  Yes, you can.  I'll honestly try to think of stuff.  Do you mean in bed or leading up to it?  Both.  Like, he's like...  Is it serious stuff or jovel stuff?  He'll lay on the bed, and he'll, like, pull his shorts down.  And sometimes he just pulls his underwear to the side, and then goes, suck my cock.  I can rich your class act.  Which I will.  It's fine. 
[02:06:00]  I understand.  We all want to say that, but we just don't, Rich.  There's a protocol.  Right.  You know, there's like a...  I'm not going to argue with you.  We all think that.  There's a flow chart that we should use to get to suck my cock.  It's not...  Love you, man.  I don't want rose petals leading up to the bed.  I'm not asking for, you know...  But you don't need seaweed, either.  It's like, come on, Rich.  There's a balance.  There's something in between.  It's like, you can ask people to not put their fingers in their cup.  Because one thing I like about Rich is he...  I'm such a... 
[02:06:30]  I don't do that.  Like, I'll let them just put...  Then I won't drink it.  But he goes to the extreme.  He goes, could you not touch that?  Like, he's just...  Instead of just going, sir, could you please not?  Could you please remake that?  I can't drink it like that.  Like, instead of just asking nicely and getting the message across.  Or like, he always needs to get the ketchup packages.  Yeah.  Even if there's ketchup on the table, right?  Oh, right.  Which is fine.  But I say, when you ask the waitress for it, just tell her that you're kind of like  got a disorder or something.  You know, just be like, oh, I'm kind of crazy.  Can you get me the, like, packages?  How does he do it?  He just goes, I need packages! 
[02:07:00]  I'm not eating out of that thing or whatever.  Oh, yeah.  You have to, like, make a scene.  I don't make a scene.  I'm not...  I just crust around the top.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Like, yesterday I was in the supermarket and I wanted to get some coleslaw and the  lady was doing the cold cuts and there was three employees that were just talking and  they weren't, let's say they, you know, okay, let's say that you would see them work in  the toll booth or whatever.  I hear you.  So none of them would help the one lady. 
[02:07:30]  I want my coleslaw.  So I go, can one of you help me?  Oh, okay.  And they go, well...  We can help you by spitting in your food now.  They said, we're done at five.  I go, well, it's four minutes to five.  Let's get some coleslaw.  Chop, chop.  Chop, chop.  Well, that's what you do, to make coleslaw, right?  Yeah.  Chop, chop.  But she would never do, she wouldn't speak out like that.  No.  Did they laugh or were they...  No, I wouldn't.  They got my coleslaw.  And I go, look at that, you still have two minutes to spare. 
[02:08:00]  You know what?  He's right, though.  Lazy fucking apes.  I'm not saying he's wrong.  Can I tell you something?  When I first met him, that was one of the things that attracted me to him was his assholiness.  One time we went into Dunkin' Donuts and he wanted to, he asked for free munchkins.  He goes, give me some free munchkins.  And the guy goes, I'm not giving you free munchkins.  And Rich goes, put the munchkins in the bag.  And the guy did and gave us free munchkins.  You robbed the place.  Yes.  That's what you did.  I heard from munchkins.  I love that about him. 
[02:08:30]  I mean, I do like that he's direct and assholey and stuff, but I just don't like it at me.  Right.  Okay.  Well, at least not all the time.  Like, once in a while, you know, it's like you can kind of be nice.  I've been better lately.  I've been better with her and the baby and stuff.  I've been better.  I've been better.  Okay.  I've done a lot of stuff.  We've just put a new floor in our house.  Okay.  I went out.  Are you getting rid of all those antiques?  Some of them.  God, I hope you are.  That big couch. 
[02:09:00]  Bonnie hates them.  No, she's still sitting here.  It's that big couch like, oh, shit.  Jesus.  Oh, I get it.  I'm old.  Are you kidding me?  I'll say it again.  You have no idea what you got.  Huh?  I got a great woman.  She's a good mom.  She's a good wife.  She's fun.  She's cool.  She makes me laugh.  But get rid of the fucking antiques.  No one enjoys your antiques.  Huh?  You just rattled off like a resume.  It's not even like a sexy kind of thing.  You just rattled off. 
[02:09:30]  Let me tell you.  I put a new, we do a new kitchen, money.  Teeth money, which I'm running out.  The spiral down is quick.  Can't you get them to just file them down?  Do you have to get all new ones?  Okay.  Go ahead.  I want a wooden floor.  Well, we both wanted a wooden floor, but she wanted a little more.  So I get a wooden floor.  We put a floor in. 
[02:10:00]  You put it in yourself?  No, I had someone.  I put it in two pieces, though, yesterday.  So I had someone do it, and it was like four or five grand.  So I'm on the road, and she says, you know, I go back to the mall, and she goes, did you  get me a present?  I said, you're standing on it.  She says, I'm going to, that I was mean for that, and that I got her it to keep, this  is what she says in the car, oh, you got me a floor to keep old cunt mouth quiet, right, 
[02:10:30]  or something like that.  Well, that's what I think he thinks of me.  He's like, this fucking cunt.  That's why I think his inner dialogue is all the time, like, oh, this fucking cunt shut up.  Okay, I'm going to get her new floors.  I hope she fucking shuts the fuck up.  Wow.  Is that your inner voice?  No, that's your own insecurities, and that's your, because I never, I do things for you  because I, I, I, I want you to be, I want you to be happy. 
[02:11:00]  Look how hard it was for him to say that.  I couldn't figure it out.  Because I love you.  Yeah, he was almost going to say, because I love you, but then it was like, ah, fuck her.  Oh, no, no, no, not yet.  I don't know Rich has a problem with love and being punished.  I do love her.  Yeah.  I do love her.  Is he bad with like, loving touching?  Oh, no, one time he took the stylus out of his, his trio phone, and he rubbed it against  my leg, and I, I still think about that.  He does love me.  No, he's not just kind of like rubbing your hand, or like, is he, is he an affectionate  guy? 
[02:11:30]  He, no.  Why don't you?  Why?  Why Rich?  Well, because sometimes he touches you, but it's like a, a toddler, or, or a monster  that doesn't, like, hasn't, hasn't figured out how to caress, you know?  A monster?  It's just like this kind of.  Oh, God, no.  He's not a good caresser?  No sensitive, like a gargoyle?  No, it's like he's going to take my skin off.  Oh, my God.  A toddler, or a monster who doesn't have a gargoyle? 
[02:12:00]  Let's see how you touch.  Huh?  Let's see how you touch.  Touch, touch Jim, and just see.  No, I won't touch him.  I'll touch.  Just show.  All right, let me see how you touch Barney's arm.  But just go.  Touch Barney's arm.  Touch Barney's arm.  No, let's see something.  Touch Barney's arm.  What do you mean by touch it?  Like, touch your wife.  Make her feel good with some kind of touch or something.  Like, maybe it's earlier in the day, and you think, well, I want to have sex later  tonight.  Oh, God.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  It gets, and honestly, it gets to this so quickly. 
[02:12:30]  The feeling after the boob?  Yeah.  That's how somebody, that's how, like, a plantation owner used to inspect a, like, a slave he was  going to buy.  Is that really how you touch her?  You kind of wrapped her arm a little and rubbed it, and then.  That's really how you touch her?  Well, no, I hug her.  I hug her.  Look, look.  One time I was crying, and he went to console me, and he was like this.  Okay, okay.  And he immediately went for the boob.  Oh, in your tits?  Yeah.  And I have tears coming down.  Suck my cock. 
[02:13:00]  Okay, Richard.  I was so scared.  What the fuck?  You two are a bister.  All right, what does she do that you wish she didn't do?  Something that really pisses you off about her.  What frustrates you about Bonnie?  We've heard about the ketchup.  The ketchup thing is amazing, because you're spitting germs wherever you go, but you're  worried about germs.  That is unbelievable.  And he's telling you later, she's wiping her face.  Right, of course.  And you should see what happens at the ketchup packet factory. 
[02:13:30]  Right.  Not on the inside.  You're touching the outside, ripping that shit open.  You don't know what's going on.  That's probably dirtier than the ketchup in the bottle, to be honest with you.  People can come put stuff in the ketchup in the bottle.  That's true, too.  And that's true, because at one time, my friend and I were in a diner, and he poured it out  and went ahead to the boo, and a fly came out.  So you know somebody put a fly in there.  Yeah, a fly could have been there.  So what does she do?  Yeah, flies sometimes walk in and weird things.  I put boogers in the ketchup at home. 
[02:14:00]  Oh.  On the side of my car, she puts them.  Whatever.  People pick their nose.  Do you pick your nose, Bonnie?  Yeah, who doesn't?  You show me one person who doesn't.  And it doesn't.  For real.  You don't ever.  How do you get them out?  I use a tissue.  You pay somebody.  I blow my nose.  I pay somebody.  You pick with a tissue.  Don't tell me that you don't put a tissue up there.  He rolls it up.  I roll it up, get it up in there, and get the old rota rest.  Oh, isn't it the best?  Yeah.  That grosses her out.  Case in point.  It's better than your finger. 
[02:14:30]  No, it's not.  And then where are you going to put it?  Yes, it is.  It's not touching your hands.  You wash your hands after.  What do you do?  You put it in your mouth.  I always put it in my ear after.  In your rear?  My ear.  No, you don't.  No, you don't.  Do you really think she puts it in her ear?  No.  Let's back to the question.  What does Bonnie do that bothers you?  We heard a lot about what bothers you.  She exact.  I fart and stuff.  He goes, you're a man.  And he gets grossed out.  And he gets a hard eye.  Bonnie's great. 
[02:15:00]  I'm not going to lie.  Hold on.  Take your gum out of your mouth.  Take your gum out.  You're still chewing the...  I'm cutting down.  I've been cutting down.  You can't keep doing that for years.  He's cutting down.  Now he's smoking cigarettes in place of the gum.  So he's only down a few pieces of gum.  There's a new smoking cigarette.  Get back to smoking.  Get off the gum.  That's like doing drugless coke.  That would send you right back to smoking quicker than this.  Did he say drugless?  Well, you know what I mean.  It's like snorting powder.  Baby laxative. 
[02:15:30]  So...  What bothers you about Bonnie?  Well, she exaggerates a lot.  Okay.  She...  I think women do in general.  I'm the biggest exaggerator in the whole world.  Big deal.  A little exaggeration.  See?  See?  That was some smart humor right there, Rich.  I know.  I've heard that joke 17 times throughout radio stations in the country.  Oh, really?  You can hear that joke.  You can hear the first fucking radio station.  That's one of her stock jokes.  Rich, Rich.  Rich, Rich.  She made it sound like she thought about it. 
[02:16:00]  Thought it up on the spot.  No, I've never heard that.  I just threw that out.  All right.  Uh, she exaggerates.  Uh, what else?  She, uh...  Uh, it's a round for divorce right there.  No, she's nothing.  I can't think of it.  A horrible girl.  Okay, sonny, I live with her.  When we're watching TV and she's eating an apple...  Oh, yeah.  ...and it's so fucking loud...  I...  You know, you just want to stick, like, a pen in her eye or something?  Because, like, the chewing...  Rich doesn't like eating an apple unless... 
[02:16:30]  ...somebody's hand helps it.  Hold it up.  That's a horse joke.  Hold it flat.  Horse joke.  It's a horse joke.  Oh.  Big tooth.  I'm an idiot.  And then when she crunches those sugar cubes...  ...do I get upset?  I hate it.  Amazing.  So exaggerating and eating apple.  I can't think.  I'm not here to say the negative things about...  Your cock is so big.  Is that the exaggerating part? 
[02:17:00]  I'm not here to say the negative things about the woman I love.  I'm...  You know, that's...  All that does is just...  I type too loud, remember?  You what?  I type too loud.  Oh, yeah.  Type too loud.  What do you use?  Chewing and typing, both too loud?  Oh, well, yeah, we...  This is from a deaf guy who...  Yeah, when she types, it's so quick and loud.  On a computer keyboard, not an old typewriter.  On a computer keyboard.  So it's that whole...  It's just so loud, and she's, like, showing off that she can type that fast.  It's annoying me.  That amazes me when people can type that fast. 
[02:17:30]  I'm just like, fuck.  It's unbelievable.  I've been using a computer for 20 fucking years, and I'm still tick, tick, tick.  And she could do it without even looking.  Like, he'll come over and talk to me, and I'll be talking to you.  Wow.  She's a great typist.  Okay.  That sucks, too.  Yeah, that's another demerit.  And I have nothing against my...  Listen, I'm not going to come in here to try...  We...  She's healthy food and apple, and she exaggerates.  We eat well together.  She's a great cook.  This bitch can cook.  Okay?  Farm girl, right?  Yeah.  Good cook.  And she'll tell you that. 
[02:18:00]  He gets mad at me.  Okay, this is one thing.  Remember, you go...  You go, why are you going to eat with your mouth closed?  Who do you think you are?  The Queen of England or something?  Eat with your mouth closed is bad.  Yes, yes.  Like all those fancy places, all the Hollywood stars.  Yeah.  He thinks I'm, like...  I'm acting like I'm on my high horse or something.  He says, mmm.  Mmm.  Are you guys going to get this together or what?  Yeah, we're getting along great.  You're getting along great again?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we had a fight the other night, a big fight. 
[02:18:30]  You know what?  Yeah, what was that over?  That I...  I'm not good with showing emotion...  Emotional...  No.  What?  No?  You're not...  You don't...  You're emotionally taxing.  Okay, no.  Yeah.  Like, because you're always...  She exaggerates.  But he's always what?  He, like, say he wants to play golf every day.  Which is fine.  I say, go play golf if it makes you happy and takes stress out of your life.  I just don't want to hear about it every other hour that you're with me. 
[02:19:00]  It's like...  What's he talking about?  Like, how do you...  Well, he goes and he puts on a golf outfit.  He'll be like, do you like this?  Does this match?  What are you trying to impress on a golf course?  You're doing.  And then he'll be like, should I go tomorrow?  Should I go at eight?  Should I go at ten?  Should I...  It's like just an endless amount of...  Shut up, right?  Yes.  Yeah.  Are you saying he needs a constant input about himself or his interest or his life when sometimes  you want to think or talk about something else, but he somehow has to make it about  something that he wants to know?  No.  I'm not self-centered.  Yes, you really are.  No, I'm not.  No.  No.  But that's fine. 
[02:19:30]  But it's like the golf thing for some reason.  We all think you are.  You just really...  Because you have no interest in it.  You don't give a shit.  And you're like, hey, you want to go play?  Fine.  But you don't want it to be a part of your life.  Well, it's like you have to take up, you know, whatever, six hours every day to go  play four and a half, five hours every day to go play golf.  It's not every day.  And it is six hours.  Okay, whatever.  Going back and forth to the golf course.  Whatever it is, that's fine.  That's like a big chunk out of your day.  Okay, then let it go.  You don't have to do another six hours of it at home. 
[02:20:00]  But I do a lot.  I run...  This is a marriage.  No one's saying that you don't do a lot of stuff at home.  I do.  It's like it's a business.  It's a machine.  Thank God.  It's a machine.  And it takes two to run the machine.  Yeah, like one person's doing the Twittering, which is rich, and the other person is spelling  all the words.  Does he make grad spelling errors on Twitter? 
[02:20:30]  No, it's just a constant.  That's the other thing.  It's like he wants me to spell all the words for him.  They're like, how do you spell become?  I mean, they're words that, you know, where I'll be like, sound it out.  I can't do it all the time.  I'm busy doing stuff.  And then he gets mad if I won't just immediately...  Sometimes I don't know how to spell the word.  And I'll be like, I don't know.  And he'll get mad that I don't...  He'll get mad at you for not knowing how to spell the word.  There's a spelling check, though.  There's a spell check.  Not on Twitter or whatever.  Oh, no, not at all.  You can spell check on Twitter. 
[02:21:00]  I don't know.  Listen, things are good.  You know, we're married.  We have good times.  We have bad.  You know, and when we fight, we get over it.  You know, she was talking about me trying to get on her dumb show.  Look, I helped, you know, throughout the beginning...  I didn't get the part.  Throughout the beginning of our relationship, when I was bringing her on the road, and she  was fucking having a tough time, because she wasn't used to my audience, you know, and  who held her while she was crying, you know, at times, or whatever. 
[02:21:30]  Squeezing her tits.  And squeezing her tits.  And pussy diving while she's crying.  You know, we help each other, and we've done that, you know, when she did her special,  I helped her.  And when I wrote for the Oscar, she helped me.  She's having an emotional breakdown.  We understand, Rich.  Fucking ghoul.  You know, what did she say?  Monetarily?  What's the word?  Is that the word?  Yeah.  Depends on what you mean.  I don't know where you're going.  I take care of things monetarily in a household, you know, and emotionally, I'm not the best  in the world, you know. 
[02:22:00]  That seems to be the issue.  Okay.  But here's the thing.  You know, I'm a little older.  All I'm saying is, like, everybody pretends a little bit.  But, like, if you're in a bad mood, like, everybody has to pretend a little bit that  they're not.  You can't just...  I'm not in a bad mood, but you always say I'm in a bad mood, because that's my demeanor.  Right?  Yeah.  Your demeanor is to look like you're in a bad mood.  No, I mean, that's why...  That's why we're laughing, Rich.  You're a lot demeanier than you used to be. 
[02:22:30]  So would you marry Bonnie all over again?  Yes.  Yes.  What do you mean, at this age, or if I was...  Right now.  Would I marry her?  Yeah, of course.  We could do another wedding.  Why don't you look at her and say that?  I would marry you a hundred times over.  Look at me, Rich.  Not her tits, Rich.  Rich is staring at her tits.  Look at her in the eye.  Not the young Joe DeRosa sitting outside.  Of course I would marry...  There's no one else on this planet I would rather be with.  Oh, so you want to leave the planet? 
[02:23:00]  What about a...  Yeah, what about another planet?  There is nobody outside of Fire Island that I would rather...  Or Provincetown.  Yeah, so it's not about me.  We're doing a dumb documentary on how funny women are.  You don't know how to sell it.  Dumb documentary.  Yeah, way to go, Rich.  Oh, you know I'm not dumb.  The word is dumb.  We're not calling it that anymore.  Cocumentary?  It's so stupid.  It's up to her what she calls it. 
[02:23:30]  No, it's up to us.  We're a team.  Well, she doesn't want to be...  Team Voss.  What's the name of our company?  McVoss?  Is that the way you called it?  Well, we don't really have a company.  Well, if we did, pretend.  Oh.  McVoss, right?  Why don't you just make a company?  How do you not have a company?  Exactly.  Should we?  Oh, sure.  Oh, my God.  Tax implications?  No.  You can do it either.  How about Bonnie and Blithering?  I was thinking, you know how they combine, like, Brangelina and stuff? 
[02:24:00]  Yeah, yeah.  We could be bitch.  Oh, Bonnie and Rich, bitch.  On stage, she kills, though.  That's a funny line.  She killed on the show right now.  No, I'm saying, but I'm saying...  Where did you get those from?  Are they sending them all?  Who is that?  Look at his pants.  Those are nice.  My other ones, you've got to see.  Those are not nice.  Are you crazy?  They're not nice.  They are nice.  Ted Knight died in those pants.  It's good to know you're dressing up to play golf.  Well, what do you mean it's good to know?  Of course you've got to do it.  What am I going to come to course looking like? 
[02:24:30]  Who are you standing there with?  Any collared shirt and super shorts.  That's Pauly Quinn, Kenny Quinn's son from Caroline's.  That manages Caroline's.  Oh, okay.  Pauly.  What's that?  Nothing.  Those fucking golf pants are awful.  They're terrible.  Melting ice cream.  No, he goes to this website.  What is it called again?  Loudmouthgolf.com.  They send me clothing.  Loudmouthgolf.com.  Yeah.  I'll wear those pants when I'm in Arizona at Scottsdale doing Mardi Gras August 1st.  Mardi Gras.  All right.  Mardi Gras.  No, no. 
[02:25:00]  He didn't.  Mardi Gras?  Mardi Gras.  Mardi Gras.  Mardi Gras.  Mardi Gras.  I know this guy, Mardi Gras.  Mardi Gras.  Mardi Gras.  Mardi Gras.  Mardi Gras.  Mardi Gras.  Mardi Gras.  Mardi Gras.  Mardi Gras.  Why don't we take a break?  Yeah.  Mardi Gras are just terrific.  God damn, man.  It's amazing.  It's exhausting.  I don't know how you do it.  It really is.  It's exhausting.  I don't know how you two are.  When you said take a break, I thought you met Rich and I for like a while.  I got excited.  Do you guys ever take a break in the marriage? 
[02:25:30]  We do all the time.  I go on the road and stuff or do whatever.  She's going up to Canada for 10 days to see her mom.  Her mom said she was glad I'm not coming, which is, you know, she threw that at me.  No, I mean, I was joking around.  But when the last time my mom and my sister came to visit when I had the baby,  Rich had to email an apology out to them afterwards.  Because he was that big of a dick.  He was stressed out, I guess, and didn't feel like he had to be nice. 
[02:26:00]  You weren't nice to our family?  I was nice.  I was American nice.  Maybe not Canadian nice.  Well, how weren't you nice?  What did you do?  I made him sleep in the car for it.  He didn't talk to them.  Why wouldn't you talk to them?  And I was in the hospital.  I did.  Well, if you sent out an apology, you even know you were a dick.  No, just to know, you know, if I was, I wasn't intentionally doing anything.  I was a little stressed with a new baby.  So what was he doing?  He wouldn't talk to them?  And to have house guests, you know, it was a little stressful at the time. 
[02:26:30]  Was he accommodating?  Is he accommodating?  Was he accommodating when they were there?  No.  He was, you know.  What's Rich's issue?  He's an asshole.  Is it because of your upbringing?  I think it is.  Mommy.  I don't trust women.  Was it mommy or daddy?  I forgot.  Women.  I don't trust women.  I went to see my mother in the nursing home yesterday.  Oh, he doesn't think Angelina Jolie is attractive.  No, you're wrong.  I said she's not as hot as everybody thinks.  I said there's so many hotter.  Yeah, I'm not into her either.  She's all right.  I can tell you there's so many hotter girls. 
[02:27:00]  Okay, what about the Megan Fox?  Yeah, very cute.  Yeah, he was like, eh.  No, she's hot.  I don't know if maybe it was a bad shot of her.  I don't even know who she is.  She hasn't taken a bad shot yet.  I don't know, but they're trying to find a bad shot.  Come on, what's wrong with that?  She's all right.  Her face.  Give me another girl.  By the way, we're showing Rich the hottest picture that Megan Fox ever took.  She's on her face.  The one under the car.  Yeah, her face.  This is like, he just doesn't like women.  Why don't you like women, Rich? 
[02:27:30]  Why do you hate your mother?  Yeah, what happened with you and...  That's Megan Fox.  That's Megan Fox.  See, that's a good...  Right there.  That's beautiful.  She doesn't have that long horse face.  Look at that pretty.  Now, that's pretty.  She's prettier than Angela Jolie.  Angela?  Angela.  I like Angela Jolie, too.  She's prettier than her.  I'm sure there's an Angela Jolie out there.  I don't like Angela Jolie.  Whatever the fuck.  So what happened?  You went to see your mother?  Yeah, yesterday.  And?  It's so in the nursing.  It's the worst.  Last time I was with them, she's totally laid out in bed, can't get up, whatever. 
[02:28:00]  And Rich, I go to Rich, just don't start a fight.  Just go in.  Say hello.  Start a fight.  No, they just push each other's buttons.  And so he goes in, he goes, what's going on?  That's the first thing.  And she goes, what the fuck does it look like?  I'm lying here.  Oh, shit.  And off they go.  Is it a bad relationship?  Yeah.  She's like the mom from The Sopranos.  Oh.  Really?  She's kind of like that?  Yeah. 
[02:28:30]  She's like, the first time I met her, I was in the bathroom getting ready, and Rich had  gone and picked her up, and this one, she was still mobile, and she came into the house,  and Rich said something to me, and I called something back, and she goes, that's her.  She sounds like a man.  Oh, shit.  Really?  Is she nice to you?  She is now, Connie.  You just can't let her.  Well, now she doesn't know what's going on or anything.  She's completely shut out.  All right.  I go to the nursing home, and I'm standing there, and they're all in the TV room.  You know, it's crazy. 
[02:29:00]  It's like one flew over a cuckoo's nest with seniors.  You know what I said?  And I'm standing there, and it smells like shit in there and stuff.  You know?  So, you know, and what do you have?  I have nothing to say.  How are you doing?  Did you eat?  What are you saying to somebody?  Why did your mom do that made you so mad at women?  Well, maybe as a kid, when you're maybe three or four, I get a bunch of them, or she takes  you, your brother, your sister, to your grandmother's, puts you on the doorstep, rings the doorbell, 
[02:29:30]  and she opens the door and goes, I don't want them.  Take them.  That could leave a scar.  That could leave a scar at three.  Or how about when you haven't seen your father in weeks, and Daddy's coming, and it's Saturday,  and you're sitting in the window all excited, and here comes Daddy.  Daddy's here.  And as he's walking up the driveway, detectives come out from behind bushes and handcuff him  and go, there goes Daddy.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  This is the best part of the story.  Your mom set up the father. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah.  By using the kids as bait.  Yeah, as pawns.  As bait, basically.  As what?  As pawns, you know, and then, you know, takes us into New York to go visit Daddy, and we  meet him at the Port Authority.  We take the fucking bus in, okay, we get off, and we're walking through the Port Authority.  There's Dad.  Wait, there he is getting handcuffed again, okay?  Or how about when you're in sixth grade, okay, and you're eating lunch in the lunchroom  with all the kids, and a lot of them are black because it was playing field, so they're 
[02:30:30]  ruthless, okay?  And one, you have to have food tickets, so you've got to hide them under your, you know,  people see you with the food tickets, you know, they're, oh, look at welfare kid, right?  So you hide them under your tray, and you try to hand it to them.  And then, so you're eating there with the lunchroom, and then the whole place goes silent because  somebody's parent walks in, right?  You know that, like, my mother walks in with the principal.  You were the kid where the parent would walk into school.  So the whole place went silent. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah.  So they heard the principal and my mother take me in the hallway.  As all the kids are walking out from, she's smacking me in the head, okay, beat me in  front of them.  That's embarrassing.  Did they laugh at you?  Yeah.  Like Carrie at the prom.  And then how about when your mother makes you wear black and white saddle shoes to school?  You Pat Boone.  Aw, I'm falling in love again.  And, you know, you go to fucking goon. 
[02:31:30]  Pat Buffoon.  There it is.  Hasn't he suffered enough, you guys?  Oh, my God.  Excuse me, the men are talking.  I'm sticking over here, you asshole.  This is where Rich and I can relate.  Rich and I can relate on this topic. 
[02:32:00]  But why not the effect?  Why not?  Oh, go ahead, dude.  Wait, real quick.  Then you go to a 12-step meeting.  I'm not breaking the tradition by saying.  And in the meetings, they go, well, they did the best they could with the tools they  had.  No, fuck.  That's bullshit.  They didn't do the best they could because they could have.  Any fucking monkey could have done better, okay, with the tools.  You know, when I was divorced with my, I didn't mean it like that.  I wasn't being a racist.  You know what?  Thumbs up that you said that.  Yeah, I'm sick of that.  They did the best they could. 
[02:32:30]  This is me off, too.  Bullshit.  Because when I was getting divorced with Kelly, with my first wife, right?  Kelly, who lives right by us.  And she's, you know, my first wife.  Perfect Kelly.  Oh, damn.  Just kidding.  Oh, shit.  That's not awkward with you and your ex right there.  At least she doesn't babysit your kids anymore.  Jesus Christ.  What the fuck's wrong with these two?  So, Kelly, when we split up, we didn't have shit, you know, but we made sure the kids saw both of us. 
[02:33:00]  You know what I mean?  I did the best I could with the tools I had.  You know what I mean?  I could have done worse.  You know what I'm saying?  So that best I could, you know what I'm saying.  That's fucking bullshit.  I think, though, we know where a lot of that anger is coming from.  Wow, right?  Yeah.  Why not the affection, though?  Don't you understand that every woman out there isn't your mom?  Well, she acts like, I'm her parents.  Oh, you don't think I'm funny?  Because her parents don't think she's funny.  Her father even says to her, I don't get it.  Well, that's what parents say. 
[02:33:30]  Your father says that, Bonnie, for real?  Yeah, he's a farmer.  And he sees her talking about her pussy on stage.  He's never seen me talk about that.  They don't watch.  Look, they don't follow my career.  I can say whatever I want.  They don't follow your career?  No, Letterman was too late for them.  They actually said that?  They like Tammy Pascatelli.  That is a little late.  They like Tammy Pascatelli.  Hold on, hold on.  For real they said that?  Yes.  Holy shit.  Her whole family doesn't, like, she thinks I'm her family.  Well, you are. 
[02:34:00]  Well.  You know, you're married and you have a gas.  No, you know what I mean.  You are.  That's sort of a definition of a family.  I think she's so fucking funny.  Excuse me.  As a, as a, as a, as a, as a, as a, as a, is there a come on my channel?  What, what are you saying?  As a comic.  You know, not a female.  And offstage and everything.  And, and I tell her that all the time.  And, and she's a brilliant writer.  I tell her she's just fucking brilliant.  She really is.  Thanks, man.  When we go into fucking meetings, just, she's, she's fucking good.  This cunt. 
[02:34:30]  That's what you should fucking talk, bitch.  She's the only one that we have in here on a regular basis, Bonnie.  Yeah.  As far as female comics go.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Who else do we have?  For real.  Who, who, who?  Uh.  I can't even name another female comic we've had on, on a regular basis.  Even a semi-regular basis.  Chelsea?  No.  She's only on once or?  Yeah.  She was on once.  She's funny.  Oh, yeah.  She's very funny.  You like Chelsea Hammond?  I did.  She's hilarious.  Why don't we take a break?  Oh, I thought we were talking about a different Chelsea. 
[02:35:00]  Oh, Chelsea Freddie is great, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Chelsea Freddie is truly, is, is, is guy funny.  Is guy funny.  Yeah.  She's also, uh, like, scathing.  Like, she's kind of mean.  Yeah, she's brutal.  I didn't expect that the first time I met her.  I remember thinking, like, are you fucking around?  Yeah, she's brutal.  Yeah.  Fucking brutal.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, you guys are similar, though, in a lot of ways.  Yeah, I'm probably a little bit funnier, but, um, I also.  So, I like Chelsea Handler.  She's like a broad, you know, she's like a 1940s, like, broad. 
[02:35:30]  I don't know how I feel about her.  She's so funny, man.  I don't.  She scares me a little bit.  Chelsea Handler?  She one time, like, literally threw me up against the wall in, in, uh, L.A., at the  Improv in L.A., and was like, you're gonna talk to me, McFarlane!  And I was like, okay.  But in a fight, you could fuck her up in a fight.  I mean, you're a fucking fan.  I don't know.  She's, she's, she's in a higher weight category than me.  A little higher weight class? 
[02:36:00]  Really?  Nice.  No, really?  She sits on that panel with those little.  That's like awkward when you say something like that.  Yeah.  No, we were just really thinking about it, and it's like, ooh, that's a nice insult.  Her TV, I think she's a good host.  I think.  Dude, she just brutalizes people.  It's like, what a great thing for a host to do.  She has the little cards, and just says fucking cutting horrible shit about people.  Yeah, we like, I mean, I like her, and she passed on Bonnie and I, and I still like her.  Yeah, she's really funny.  I mean, I do the show whenever I'm out there, but I mean, you're a big act.  You're a friend of the show. 
[02:36:30]  I get it, yeah.  Wait, she passed on you guys for the show?  Yeah.  I didn't even want to be on the show.  I didn't even either.  For the record, I said, don't put my name in there.  I didn't, well, I didn't know we were just at the Improv in L.A.  Because I didn't want, because I didn't want to get passed on.  We were in L.A., we're at the Improv, and all of a sudden.  Well, she has on, and she passed on you, too.  She said not right now.  I think maybe they think I'm going to go on, or we go on like it's a tough crowd,  and start smashing the other people, which I would.  That would be my natural vision.  You guys would be great on that show.  We can continue with you guys.  We've got to take a break. 
[02:37:00]  We've been doing like an hour straight here.  Hey, Dana White called the show right off the bat, and a lot of people saw that UFC 100.  Jimmy was there, and a lot of people talking about what Brock Lesnar did after the fight and all.  And I think we're going to play a couple highlights from our interview, or at least one for now,  and then we'll get a few more on before the end of the show.  And if you want to see or listen to the whole interview, make sure you listen to the replay at 3 o'clock today.  Right, the entire thing.  He called it like 6 or 6.05.  We talked about a half hour.  Here's a taste.  What's your thoughts on the Brock Lesnar thing there, Dana? 
[02:37:30]  I gave Brock my thoughts as soon as he left the office.  I imagine you did.  It was, you know, listen, Brock gets fired up, and, you know, the hard part for me is I know Brock Lesnar.  He's a good guy.  He's a smart guy.  For him to go out and do what he did to me personally that night, you know, is what I was upset about.  Meaning him going after one of our sponsors.  Yeah.  Just being goofy.  I mean, and I'll tell you guys, listen, Brock made a lot of money. 
[02:38:00]  He made a lot of money on Saturday night.  So to be, you know, I've never dealt with anything like that before.  It's never happened to me.  And, you know, I've been in the fight business since I was 19, and I've been in this business for 12 years.  And it's never happened to me before.  So that was a first.  You know, in the media and in the countdown show basically saying, you know, Lesnar is going to get destroyed.  This guy knows nothing about fighting.  You know, I'm going to rip his leg.  I should have ripped his leg off that night. 
[02:38:30]  You know, lots of crazy stuff was going back and forth between these two.  And Lesnar was really pissed off about the first fight that he thought he should have won.  And the referee, you know, basically cost him the fight.  Right.  And didn't he get mad that the referee, he said, let him tap too long, too?  He said that he thought he tapped and that he kept tapping.  And he was right.  Listen, Mazzagotti, as a referee, this fucking guy shouldn't even be watching MMA on TV, let alone refereeing it.  Wow.  I think he's the worst ref in the history of any fight business ever. 
[02:39:00]  He's horrible.  Hey, there's an exclusive.  Stupid me, I thought you picked the refs.  No, we don't pick the refs.  You don't pick those guys.  No.  The Athletic Commission does.  Those guys are picked by the government.  You just don't like that guy at all, huh, Dana?  It's not that I don't like him.  He's a nice guy.  No, you don't like what he does out there.  That's what I mean.  He's an absolute nice guy.  He has no business whatsoever being anywhere near mixed martial arts.  And anybody who knows mixed martial arts knows, if you get anywhere near Frank Mir's guard, you're probably getting submitted. 
[02:39:30]  Yes.  He's probably the best submission heavyweight in the history of the game.  Brock got down there and Frank Mir couldn't do anything.  He was powerless.  And Brock is so big and so powerful.  Their first clash before they hit the ground, by the time they hit the ground for the first time, Frank's bridge of his nose was already cut and bleeding.  I mean, Lesnar, man, I'll tell you, I gave this guy a shot.  He was 1-0. 
[02:40:00]  I said, this isn't the place to learn how to fight.  His attitude was, I'm either good at this or I'm not.  I'm going to find out.  I only want to fight in the UFC.  And it's amazing what this guy has done.  Well, you've got to move on to the press conference.  So there's Brock Lesnar sitting there with a Bud Light bottle.  I'm like, wow.  But it made you...  David knows how to do some talking.  Dude, it made you like Lesnar more.  It really does make you...  Because he came out and it's like, that was to me, like when he came out, like he had been like, all right, I got my ass chewed out.  To me, like that was the first time you see this guy like, oh, that's who he is. 
[02:40:30]  Like, he's just a regular dude.  He got his ass chewed out by the boss and now he wishes he didn't say that stupid shit.  Like, I liked Lesnar a lot more after seeing him at that press conference.  I'm going to tell you right now, and you know me, if somebody's a dickhead, I'll say it.  Lesnar's not a bad guy.  I just don't want...  I just don't get why he's, you know, acting like...  But his thing is, listen, I don't...  This is his honest to God thing.  He's like, I don't give a fuck if they boo me or cheer me.  He says, I could care less.  You know?  He says, I'm out here fighting for me and my family. 
[02:41:00]  And if they don't like me, fuck them.  You know, that's his attitude.  I said, cool, I get that.  But, you know, stay away from my sponsor.  That's right.  In studio today, Rich Voss and Bonnie McFarlane doing a little filming for a documentary that might see the...  Might see the light.  Yeah, these guys are doing with...  These guys are filming...  Oh, shit, it's my kid.  Uh, the documentary, uh... 
[02:41:30]  Why does he still have an old trio?  He's the worst.  I have one, too, guys.  You're the second worst.  Yeah, because...  But you want a new phone, but, you know.  What is that about?  I don't know.  Why?  Are they bad phones?  Are they ancient?  I haven't had a trio in five years.  Oh, I don't know.  I used to like my trio, but, you know, they were kind of popular when I had it.  Yeah.  Years ago.  A phone with a stylus.  You have a stylus with yours?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  What's a stylus?  I don't like to touch my finger to a screen. 
[02:42:00]  It's something I don't like.  All right.  Well, then the stylus is perfect.  Yeah.  The stylus is awful.  It's always getting lost.  Tink.  Tink.  Don't you sludge your screen?  Yeah, then you wipe your screen.  Everything all right at home, Rich?  Yeah, we got, you know, my middle daughter, my second favorite, watching the baby.  Oh, okay.  So, and then my other daughter, my favorite, is going to pick him up.  We hate that your phone has got a stylus.  Yeah, we're really annoyed. 
[02:42:30]  Can I see your phone?  But how else would he show affection?  I'm going to get a, I might get that, I might get that pre, that palm pre.  Ooh, but it seems like, I want to take a, like, I wonder if they have, where you can  go for like a day and take a course on it, or like four hours, you know what I mean?  The iPhone does at Apple, you can go there and they give you classes on the Apple app.  Yes, they do.  We have an app for that.  I see.  You can, you can just figure out the phone on your own, Rich.  Yeah, but then what you think you've figured out. 
[02:43:00]  You're not solving life's problems.  You're right, you do figure it out, and then just maybe a hundred things you didn't figure  out, but you don't know that you didn't figure them out, because you didn't figure them  out.  But you don't need to know, because you wouldn't use that stuff.  I would use a lot of things.  I get a phone, and I go, all right, I want to use it for this, this, and this, and then  I figure out how to do that.  Yeah.  All right, whatever.  I'm just going to get a phone.  Just get a new phone.  What service?  I don't have to talk about it anymore.  All right.  I'll do whatever you guys want.  Do you have Sprint?  Yeah.  Why?  What do you have?  AT&T is horrible. 
[02:43:30]  Horrible.  Stay with Sprint.  I like my AT&T.  No, you don't.  Yeah, I do.  You have to get a home phone put in, because AT&T.  I know, but I still like AT&T.  Are there sponsors on this network?  No, I don't even know.  I'm just being honest.  I do like my AT&T, except when I'm at my house.  Yeah, exactly.  In Manhattan.  That's the truth.  I can see if you live in the Minneapolis woods somewhere, but Manhattan, you know, the  island, the financial capital of the world.  But wherever else I go, Long Island, Jersey, Midtown Manhattan, wherever. 
[02:44:00]  Have you dropped all the time?  I got beautiful service.  The only time it's been is when I'm at my house.  Sunset Strip in Los Angeles, I couldn't get service.  Oh, really?  Dude, I get dropped everywhere.  Well, LA is notorious for horrible sales sales.  Everywhere.  I get perfect reception.  There you go.  You don't like the volume on it?  I don't like the volume on the speaker when I go to, like, but speaker phone works great.  But, like, if I'm playing something off of my iPod in my iPhone, you know, then the volume 
[02:44:30]  sucks, but you're not going to listen to music out of those shitty little speakers anyway.  You put all the earbuds, and there's plenty of volume.  You blow your fucking ears out.  You know, guys, speaking of phones, we got a nice little story that happened over the  Oh, what a segue.  Thank you.  What a segue.  Did we spend enough time on that dumb documentary?  Can we move on with our radio show now?  Yeah.  We're just your guests.  You're the producer.  Oh, yeah.  Mardi Gras.  I thought you got great stuff today, actually. 
[02:45:00]  What happened?  Good stuff.  Good stuff.  What happened?  Nothing.  We're just ready to, you know.  Waiting for the, um, the story?  The phone story.  This stupid mistake, the Carol's mistake, I got hurt, you know?  They are a pair of workers with the City Department of Environmental Protection who pulled the  cover off the sewer on Victory Boulevard to flush it out.  Alexa's angry mother, Kim, calls what happened next criminal.  It was opened.  The truck was parked behind that pole, and they walked a good, what, 10, 15 feet at least 
[02:45:30]  to go get the cones.  And left it open.  Right.  Cones should have been here first.  Alexa, who was walking to the store with a friend, felt the earth move.  Suddenly, everything was dark and smelly.  It was just really gross.  That's funny.  How is this mother, we know what, you know, but how is this mother trying to turn this  around?  The cones.  Your daughter is a dummy. 
[02:46:00]  She walked into an open fucking manhole.  One of the biggest dummies ever.  Alexa admits this is what she was doing, texting while walking, and she did not notice the open  manhole cover.  Down she went, five feet, into the muck.  It was over my head.  She says an apologetic DEP worker helped her get out.  She went to the hospital, and the city opened the investigation, issuing this statement.  We regret that this happened, and wish the young woman a speedy recovery.  Regardless if I'm texting or not, like, if there was cones there, I'm going to see a 
[02:46:30]  big orange cone.  The family may sue the city.  Medical.  How are you going to see a big orange cone when you didn't see the big open hole, you  dummy, and you're looking down when you text, by the way?  It looked like the toilet scene in Schindler's List, when the head popped out.  Oh, boy.  That wasn't bad.  Well, sort of.  You know what I kind of mean?  You know what I mean?  Well, it was, yeah, yeah, yeah.  In the doody.  The doody.  That's funnier.  Woman, a speedy recovery.  Regardless if I'm texting or not, like, if there was cones there, I'm going to see a 
[02:47:00]  big orange cone.  The family may sue the city.  Medical bills are mounting.  And Alexa lost one shoe.  Do you want that shoe back?  I could just say that.  Oh, could it?  The city should pay their medical bills.  Or at least your shoe.  Yeah.  Well, at least wash the shoe off it, because shit, what kind of medical bills?  Did she fall in shit, by the way?  It was shit?  Because she said she was up over her head or close to her head.  So is that shit?  Yeah, it's fucking shit. 
[02:47:30]  I love how they're so mad.  Like, how do you fall into a hole as you're looking down?  I don't know.  Well, you do something that's so embarrassing, though.  You have to kind of, like...  Be outraged.  Yes.  Wow, look at this one.  Rich, look at her.  Jesus, who is she?  It looks like she could be, like, a long lost kid of yours.  Is that the texture?  She looks like a Wolverine.  Oh, my God.  Those are great.  Where is she from?  I don't know.  She looks like a rabid dog.  Yeah.  Rich, that's what you look like. 
[02:48:00]  Do you get that?  Oh, shit.  That is.  That's your face.  Yeah, that's why I said it looks like you're a long lost kid.  Oh, man.  It looks like the old picture to you when you did stand-up.  And crack.  And blue guys for more drugs.  You know, that stage of your life.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  You know, that fun stage that we have to bring up every time.  Rich isn't even correcting blue guys anymore.  Just because he knows Bonnie knows all the stories.  If he goes, I have a blue guys, if she might jump in, he goes, sure you have.  Yes, you have. 
[02:48:30]  Blue guys.  If I had blue guys, and she wouldn't stick around.  All right.  And watch.  Excellent defense.  Yeah, really.  That's like a little, like, do you want to rest your case at this point?  Oh, that's old.  Oh, that's pretty, I look distinguished.  Distinguish you as an ass.  The shirt?  Is that what's distinguishing you?  Well, we have a question on the line.  Let's say hi to Andy in New Hampshire. 
[02:49:00]  Andy.  Hello.  Hello, Andy.  Did boss just say Schuller's List instead of Schindler's List?  No, I said Schuller's.  It was something like that.  Yeah, he said Schuller.  Oh, my God.  I said Schuller's stupid.  He gets most of the Jew stuff right.  Yeah.  Schindler's List.  I'm doing so much better on my Sch's.  Someone taught me.  Who taught you?  Speech.  That's not an Sch word.  That's a...  I mean, yeah, C-H. 
[02:49:30]  Speech is C-H.  Yeah.  Oh, that's what I meant.  Well, both.  I have problems with both.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Say sugar church.  Sugar.  Hold on.  Oh, wow.  Holy shit.  He said sugar, and then he had to actually take time to gulp.  Hold on.  Gulp.  Hold on.  Wow.  A broken water main in there or something.  It fell in my mouth.  Say it fast. 
[02:50:00]  What do you want to say?  Sugar.  Sugar church.  Sugar church.  Yeah, that's perfect.  It's not perfect.  It's better.  She went to a speech therapist?  No, outside of comedy club.  I was talking to one.  Oh, okay.  Cool.  What did they say to make it easier or better for you to say?  Besides jump in front of a car.  Sugar.  Sugar.  Sugar.  Sugar.  Sugar.  Sugar.  It's so hard for him to say that.  The password is sugar.  What did they tell you to do? 
[02:50:30]  That my jaw goes out, and air does something, goes through, and my tongue.  It's called breathing.  Okay.  What they're saying is my jaw is, see, I let it slip to the right.  Yes.  And press my tongue to the roof of my mouth.  It's a lot of steps.  Sugar.  That was perfect.  Well, it is, but it takes you so long to do it.  I know.  That's why it's so much easier the other way. 
[02:51:00]  Just fuck it.  Say it regularly.  What?  Just say it regularly without practicing.  Have some sweet blood.  Have some sugar.  Why do you move your jaw?  Why don't you just make your jaw?  Why don't you hold your face and you say, sugar, church?  Sugar.  It's still terrible.  Oh.  Stop putting your tongue up.  Leave your tongue down.  Let your tongue relax.  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  What's going on with you guys?  I don't know.  Things are, windows are appearing on my, I'm trying to get to drudge and windows just 
[02:51:30]  keep appearing.  I hate windows.  Hate windows.  Ah, and now.  There you go.  Now I'll send a report to windows because they always ask you, would you like to send a  report?  Yes.  I always send a report.  Who reads those?  I know.  No, stop.  There we go.  Breakfast with O and A.  Yes, that's what it is. 
[02:52:00]  Breakfast with O and A.  Welcome.  Jim's eating half a jar of peanut butter as part of his diet.  But as long as it's like non-fat.  I haven't had that much.  Oh, wow.  What do you do?  I'm taking a little delicate jibs of it.  Little pieces.  And before we went to break, Bonnie was commenting on how she started sitting like that and she  was laid down.  I was.  On the couch.  And I tried to lay again, but it's not.  Yeah, I was kind of looking at that.  She looks very sexy laying down, Rich. 
[02:52:30]  It's like hard.  Like that.  It's kind of a sexy thing.  Like you don't look at her anymore, like in a way like, wow, damn.  Oh, yeah.  The other night she took her shirt off and I was like, whoa, let's do it.  I was a hopeless romantic.  But you think he's just retelling the story like that to be funny.  No, that's exactly what happened.  Whoa, let's do it.  Look over and I go, whoa, let's do it.  And she looks good naked.  I mean, I'm telling you.  Yeah.  Her shit is tight down there, too.  Really?  We can't figure that out.  Huh?  She's fucking phenomenal. 
[02:53:00]  Thanks, guys.  Thanks, man.  Thanks a lot.  Yeah, she took her stuff off the other night, man.  Nice stuff.  Her fucking, she had a baby.  She looks good.  And you just go like, you know, whoa, let's do it.  You don't say anything nice, like really complimentary first.  That fucking, and the baby didn't fuck up her pussy at all.  Yeah, because it came out my ass.  My asshole is huge.  It's just hanging down and all nasty, but pussy's tight. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah, and the asshole popped out like an aardvark nose.  Yeah, I have like a huge hemorrhoid.  It's kind of like a love-hate, though, because I don't want to get rid of it.  Do you want to have a roid?  Yeah, because when I scratch it, it feels so good.  So, you know what I mean?  Like, if I get rid of it, then I get rid of that really good feeling when I scratch.  Yeah.  That's disgusting.  It's the same premise behind smoking. 
[02:54:00]  Wow.  Boy.  I don't know why things keep coming.  I'm having a battle with windows that keep popping up.  It's whack-a-mole.  I'm playing whack-a-mole.  Holy shit, there's ten fucking windows that just opened up.  What happened?  Hate computers.  They're so necessary now, though.  Can't do anything without one.  Without a computer.  Do you go anywhere without a computer?  No way.  You need it.  It's unbelievable.  Look at all those.  I've got my trio.  You got your trio, so you're set. 
[02:54:30]  Just that stylus.  And you could jab people with it.  Put some AIDS blood on the tip and just jab people in the subways with it.  I can't believe they let me on the plane with it.  Now I'm going to give them my blood.  Yeah.  I know.  Somebody, like, if you had a stylus just in your pocket and they made you empty your pockets,  they would say, you can't take this.  But as long as it's in your phone, it's okay.  It could be a weapon.  You could poke someone right in the neck with that.  And an MSNBC lockup, that would be considered... 
[02:55:00]  Can I shank?  Do you ever watch that show?  I watch it all the time.  I love those prison shows.  Isn't it great?  It's great.  But it's like the same show.  It doesn't matter.  Today we take you into Kentucky State Prison.  And it's the same show as if, like, Oregon or something.  It's a bunch of ethnic people stabbing each other and the guards having to take some crazy shit-throwing prisoner out of his cell.  I did an N.A. convention in Palm Springs like a week ago, two weeks ago, right? 
[02:55:30]  It was Palm Springs.  So it was all N.A.  Narcissian Honest Convention.  So the convention had the whole hotel, right?  See, the pool, right?  All these people at the pool.  I mean, these people are supposedly in recovery.  I'm walking by, you know, with people with tattoos of swastikas.  I felt like I was walking through the yard at San Quentin as I'm walking through this.  San Quentin.  You know? 
[02:56:00]  What's it called?  San Quentin.  San Quentin.  Quentin, but Quentin, whatever.  San Quentin.  Quentin.  San Quentin.  You a fan of Colin Quinn, are you?  That one's not as bad, though, Rich.  Yeah, that's a marginal.  Almost acceptable.  We'll give you that one.  And you see these gang tattoos.  It's so...  That's what's intimidating.  If you went to prison, they didn't have tattoos.  I don't think they'd be as intimidating.  As intimidating?  Yeah, I mean...  Were you offended by the swastika ones? 
[02:56:30]  Well, yeah, I was.  I saw one guy, he had a piece.  Well, in my head, I'm going, this is unbelievable.  Then if you turn over to the recovery side, you're going, well, maybe the guy only has a week  clean, and he's trying to turn his life around, and right now, you know, maybe sometime...  Maybe in order to get rid of the drugs in his life, he's embraced Nazism.  Yeah, see, I think if you hate Jews, it's deeper than cocaine.  Why she's laying like that, right?  I don't know. 
[02:57:00]  That's great.  She's trying to get into a new club.  Hey, guys.  Bonnie's laying on her tummy.  Yeah.  Yeah, so that my asshole can breathe.  She got her butt up in the air.  Do you guys spank each other at all?  I spank her sometimes.  Yeah, I enjoy that.  And then she gets my dinner.  Oh, oh, you.  Can we see your spanking technique?  Go ahead and spank.  And how do you do it? 
[02:57:30]  Does she go over your knee?  No, it's during...  Well, come on, Red.  How's your spank like that?  It's like...  It's almost like his hands don't have the same muscles as other people.  You know what I mean?  Like, he has half...  Wait, how is this done, really?  Oh, ah!  Glasses.  Holy shit, Red.  He broke his sunglasses. 
[02:58:00]  Not, are you okay, Bonnie?  He yelled, my glasses.  My glasses!  How about you chuckle your wife?  Bluey beams!  Because I think you broke them as they were...  Yeah, dug into my arm.  Yeah, jamming into her.  That's all right.  The physical pain is not nearly as harsh as the emotional bit.  Rich had his glasses in his collar kind of by his neck, and he laid on her, and they broke.  I'm so happy that happened.  He went to lay romantically on top of his wife and snapped it romantically out of you.  Like, he's just crawling aboard. 
[02:58:30]  Yes, my turn.  Like, he's getting on a surfboard.  Oh, your ass is just flat as one.  Oh, Rich.  Wow, Rich.  Sometimes he calls my ass Margaret Cho's face.  Do you have a flat ass?  Do you have a flat ass?  I don't know.  It's like...  It's there. 
[02:59:00]  It's there.  Say it.  No, but...  Your pants...  She's not wearing pants that are, um...  It's...  Yeah, I'll try to tighten it up.  Like, when her pants are down, her ass is nice, like, and round.  Right?  But with...  All right, look.  Show her the ass.  In that way, it's flat.  Yeah, that way it doesn't...  That way...  That way.  Let me see from the side.  And then this way.  Oh!  Oh, yeah!  Wow!  Look at that.  Bonnie has a very nice ass there, Rich.  It's nice.  What are you doing?  Do that again? 
[02:59:30]  No.  We wanted to see the hemorrhoid.  Now, that would be something.  That's what's giving my ass shape right now.  That was good.  Not a dimple on there or anything?  No celluloid?  Nothing, man.  Holy shit.  You are a magic man.  You're kidding, right?  Did he say celluloid?  Celluloid.  Celluloid.  What do you say, Rich?  Try it again.  Celluloid.  There you go. 
[03:00:00]  Celluloid.  Loid and cellulite.  Cellulite.  Cellulite is the best.  Now, that was one of the names he suggested for our daughter.  Cellulite.  Cellulite.  Oh, God.  So that's how you spank her?  Nice.  We spank good.  We spank good.  Oh, God.  What is that?  That was a, could you move?  I want to sit on the couch.  How do you spank?  There's no right or wrong way to spank.  You want Jimmy to show how to spank your wife right?  Yes.  Somebody else do it.  Rich, just to see, let Jimmy spank her properly. 
[03:00:30]  No, I can't spank.  I can't do it.  No, yeah, don't spank.  Bonnie, I can't.  What?  You can spank me, though.  Why?  Because you think of me as a man?  No, because you might spank wife.  Is everybody gay?  What's that?  God damn it.  I wouldn't feel proper to do that to my friend's wife.  You're right.  But what is it?  Does Rich talk to you dirty when he's spanking you?  We used to talk dirty.  I forbid him to speak anymore.  Now when we have sex, she says, right from the beginning, she goes, okay, we're allowed  to think of other people. 
[03:01:00]  Who do you think of?  Not random people or just dicks?  They're actual people that I've met in my travels.  Really?  Hmm.  Oh, wait.  Rich now needs to know who.  What do you mean actual people?  Like people that live by us?  No, no, no.  Like people I've seen on TV and stuff.  No.  She just was like, uh-oh.  You know, like I read a lot of books and just characters from the books I bring to life.  Yeah.  I feel like I've met them because I've read so much about them. 
[03:01:30]  She brags how much she reads.  That's terrific.  So Rich, do you guys ever look at porn together?  Yeah.  We all have good porn because all our porn's free.  And do you ever make her look at guys on the internet and tell you that she'd fuck them?  Not that I've ever done that.  What?  Oh, are you kidding me?  No, but now that you've put that seed in his head, he will.  Oh, are you kidding me?  When she used to tell me about her college professor that she fooled around with?  Oh, whew.  Is that fucking exciting or what?  It is, yeah.  What, that I went to college?  It happens, bitch. 
[03:02:00]  Remember when he broke into the library?  The library.  Yeah, I'll have some libraries with whipped cream.  As long as it doesn't give me cellulite.  Holy shit, is that funny, man.  You're amazing, Rich.  So you don't like him to talk when he's spanking you because it messes up the thought process? 
[03:02:30]  Fantasy.  Yeah, you gotta get, you know.  We were gonna have sex last night, man.  We had it planned.  What happened?  My daughter had to come over and watch Raina sleep over because we got up so early and left.  You know, we weren't gonna leave the baby alone again.  So, you know, she came over.  Once a week we leave her alone, that's it.  So we couldn't really have sex because we were too tired by the time my daughter.  My daughter came over at 12 o'clock.  I'm like, what the fuck are you doing now until 12 o'clock?  Why couldn't you just have sex quietly?  Huh?  Why couldn't you just have sex quietly? 
[03:03:00]  Quiet sex.  You can't, there's no such thing as quiet sex.  Oh, yeah, there is.  You make that sound, you go, you know, you just can't mow.  You make that sound when you're peeking through a window.  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah.  It's still sex.  I'm jerking off.  The worst part about fucking a girl in the ass is when she goes on the toilet after and you can hear like.  What are you guys, your ear against the door?  What the fuck are you doing?  And now you're calling your face a toilet? 
[03:03:30]  What does that happen also with the badge?  No, when you have to, when a girl has to shit out cum, it really does just wreck.  Shit out cum.  It's not.  It has to happen.  See, that's what's wrong with butt sex is that there's so like.  It's ugly.  Poop could come out.  I mean, it's like you're really taking a risk.  It's called getting in the trenches. 
[03:04:00]  Yeah, you got to have a stomach for it.  And after that, it's just an ugly sound.  You're ready for it.  If I smell poo, we're through.  That's my motto.  Oh, that's a nice motto.  It's a great platform for political office.  If you smell poo, we're through.  Now, does this mean.  Mind is if you're a shmoo.  There could be, under any circumstances, like you're, like he's, let's say, taking you from behind.  Oh, can I tell you a story about what, I remember now what a dick he is.  One time I was blowing him quite well, by the way, and he farted. 
[03:04:30]  Don't you think that's horrible?  And then he gets mad.  That's the best thing I've ever heard.  I've seen that a whole thing.  Holy shit, you got no fucking class.  It was funny.  Did he then just stop laughing like a child?  Yeah, like it was the greatest thing that ever happened.  But then he's like, come on, keep going, keep going. 
[03:05:00]  Come on, come on.  Like, he's all upset that I took offense to that.  Of course.  Just stop.  Did you feel like a little whoosh of it?  Did you smell it?  It was so horrendous.  The worst thing on the planet.  No, you don't walk by my desk and fart on my head at times?  Not on your head, in your area.  So you fight fire with fire like that?  Yeah.  Farting is fine.  Does he have good smelling farts there, Rich?  In the elevator coming up, I laid the loudest. 
[03:05:30]  It was, I pressed my ass against the wall on purpose.  Did you do?  No, it was hot.  But I always say, excuse me.  A little back pressure.  It was so loud.  And everybody was so uncomfortable.  And Bobby goes, was that you?  And I couldn't stop laughing.  It really is always funny.  Jimmy laid one out in the elevator.  It was a silent one.  But it smelled so fucking bad that he got a woman so mad at everyone in the elevator. 
[03:06:00]  It's always funny.  I had my back to everybody, but I was shaking because I was laughing so hard.  And it smelled horrific.  And this woman was so pissed off that she had to stay in that elevator and smell his funk.  It's hilarious.  It really is funny.  That's fucking funny, man.  Jimmy got mad at me, really mad at me once we were on the road.  Me?  Yeah.  And we were at some one-nighter and we were at some shithole. 
[03:06:30]  And we went in to the hotel before we were driving home to go to the bathroom.  And I took a little shit in a baggie.  What?  What?  And I wrapped it up and tied it and put it in his toiletries.  Oh, my God.  Why did you do that?  Because I wanted him to get home and open his toiletries and see a bag of shit.  Did that really happen?  I think it did, yeah.  Oh, that is so old.  But here's the thing.  How do you shit in a bag? 
[03:07:00]  I mean, that's hard.  That takes skill.  I did it on a little wastebasket.  I sat on the wastebasket.  A sack of shit from a sack of shit.  Oh, my God.  But see, that must have been a long time ago because now you really have to work up to your shits, right?  We start hearing about it early in the morning.  Oh, my God.  I know.  Get up an hour early.  There is so much talk about, like, his poop.  It's coming.  Like, at what time?  Maybe in a half hour.  Are we talking about it?  Oh. 
[03:07:30]  It's poop and golf.  Poop and golf.  That's it.  She wants to talk about, oh, it's a little baby talk with you.  You know, she wants to make plans.  You know, when you get older, you get up.  It doesn't just happen.  It takes about an hour for your stomach to sell.  I haven't even done mine today yet, so it'll probably back up until tomorrow.  Why don't you just not worry about it and wait until you feel you've got to take a shit and then you take a shit.  Because he's scared he's going to be at the mall or something.  Or out.  He's going to the bathroom.  And then he's going to have to come home.  I don't like using other toilets.  No, but you'll shit in a waste paper basket. 
[03:08:00]  That was a long time ago.  So use it on a toilet.  Once in a while, you have to.  Just shut up.  Do you like doing that?  No, but I shit.  I don't.  Whatever.  The comfort of your own home is always the best.  But you've got to go.  That shitting is such a ball and chain.  One hundred and eighty-nine tiles on my floor.  You've counted them all.  I love a good dump at home.  But you know what he's got?  Do you guys know this?  He's got book wallpaper in his bathroom.  Yeah, I've heard of it. 
[03:08:30]  What is that?  Book wallpaper?  Yeah.  It looks like a study.  Like.  It's the closest he's ever come to reading.  Like the spines of all the books?  Yes.  Like they're on shelves?  Yes.  Do they have names on them?  Or it's just kind of a abstract-y kind of a.  Yeah, kind of like an old, you know.  Was it made from the bathroom?  It's probably all like pun names.  A tale of two shitties. 
[03:09:00]  That's good.  So it's only in your bathroom?  Yeah, we're doing the whole place.  Just fucking yours.  This year is a fucking nightmare fortune.  Oh, enjoy it.  I am.  We only have a few years left.  Yeah, right?  What are you going to tell you?  Putting equity.  Putting equity in your place.  It's not like you're pissing it away.  That's right.  If you put too much into a place that's a townhouse,  it's not going to, you know.  People say a townhouse is, you know,  mine say they go for $250 around, 
[03:09:30]  or $240 around the area, $240.  Even if you put $30,000 into it,  you're not going to go $270.  People are going to go,  I'm not paying $270 for a fucking townhouse.  You know what I mean?  It's not like a house.  That Jew can blurt those numbers out like that.  It's not like a house.  Wham-o.  Yeah.  Yeah?  I heard you have a giant couch in your...  Who did you hear that from?  Everyone.  I just heard.  You have a giant...  He's been at our house.  I've been there.  You have?  Before you...  Who told you that?  He emailed his daughter still?  Paintings. 
[03:10:00]  Paintings that look like they're...  That were bought at like a hotel painting sale.  We do have hotel style.  Yeah.  This is Frank Marriott.  And that's a picture of Bill Hilton.  How do you know this stuff?  I just heard.  I heard.  And Hotel Six the Third.  I heard you have like antiques that are...  It just...  It looks like someone's grandmother's house.  Well, that we all know.  Like that.  Gay grandma.  Yeah.  You get rid of some of that stuff, Bonnie?  Some of it.  I would love to, but he keeps going, that's my grandmother's. 
[03:10:30]  So then you can't really make somebody...  So why would you ever shit?  He's got like a china cabinet with china in it.  It's like...  What are you doing?  You got a china cabinet?  Yeah, like...  Dude, I got married, you know, people know, and I said, no fucking china.  No, I mean, I'm not going to get a china cabinet.  What the fuck?  You know, do you use the china?  Do you use the china?  It's so dumb.  He's got like a lot of things that have no business around Rich Fox. 
[03:11:00]  Too classy.  And one's a fucking middle comic from Canada.  So now wait, the china cabinet...  These two are on fire.  Why don't you guys have a TV show?  I think they should.  People are saying I would watch these two on TV.  How the fuck did Comedy Central not pick up our fucking show?  It's just fucking unbelievable.  Who cares?  We've got a cockumentary now, Rich.  That's right.  No, it's just fucking unbelievable that our show that we did four fucking years ago was  so funny.  I'm going to bring in the pilot because you guys never saw it. 
[03:11:30]  Rich, it's really your mother that you're angry at.  Listen, and we were so ahead of our time.  They're doing shows like ours now that we did.  Why was your show ahead of...  I got to hear this because Bonnie's dying over there.  Your show is ahead of its time.  Why?  Well, the newlyweds had been on, you know, the Nick and Jessica thing.  Yeah.  Excuse me.  But no...  Why is your show ahead of the time?  At the time.  Because nobody was doing reality like that at all following...  What?  When? 
[03:12:00]  When we...  He's saying...  I think what he's trying to say is...  At this point, I don't remember TV without reality.  Yeah, but...  I don't even remember what it was.  The Kardashians weren't on yet.  The gently produced, or heavily produced as they actually are, type of...  They were more fly on the wall, like the Osbournes.  Okay, like real world and whatnot, where they've just wung it.  And now you're talking like Family Jewels with that asshole and the Hogan's.  Yeah, where they, like, make...  They're basically kind of acting around whatever, yeah. 
[03:12:30]  Assisted reality.  Assisted reality.  Our other pilot was so fucking bad.  Oh, my God.  That when I watched it...  Hold on a minute.  I recognize this broad on TV.  I'm like, how do I know her?  Remember that artist, Lisa Lisa?  Yeah.  That's Lisa Lisa.  Which one?  No, Lisa Lisa Lisa.  Yeah, she's Lisa Lisa Lisa now.  She's Lisa Lisa.  She's Lisa squared.  What does she do?  Holy shit.  It would be Lisa cubed.  Oh, get enough with the conditioner.  She only just had a little bit of peanut butter. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah.  On some ricey cakes.  Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.  But our pilot was so bad.  The second one, the first one was great.  Yeah.  The second one wasn't good.  The pilot, the second pilot for Lifetime, someone asked Rich.  I heard him say this.  Someone said to Rich, did you think that was a good pilot?  He goes, I watched half of it, then I turned and hit Bonnie in the head.  You don't like the second one?  Oh, God, I wish it bad.  Why?  Were you listening to too many people?  No.  I'm sure you do.  No, no one can see it. 
[03:13:30]  Because we, like, as we were doing it, we realized we were like, we can't tell any of  our friends about this show.  If it gets picked up, we're going to have to be in secret somehow.  It was that, it's embarrassing.  What was bad at that?  That's funny, though.  Well, because they, it was Lifetime, which was probably not a great fit for us.  And then they, they wanted us, they loved that we were edgy and everything.  But then as we were doing it, they would say, oh, you're not, you know, I don't know  if our, our audience will relate to you guys. 
[03:14:00]  So then they'd put words in our mouth.  Can you say this?  Can you say this?  Like what?  Like when you come in.  They put words in Rich's mouth and they drown.  They had us moving into a new house, which we weren't doing.  I mean, they had us doing something we totally weren't doing.  So they'd rented us this house that we were going to live in.  And they took my furniture out of my house and put it in this.  So I had it.  So they had some money behind this.  Yeah.  Oh, they put.  Way more than Comedy Central.  What the fuck?  They put in over like 250 grand for this pilot.  They overthought it, man.  And then, so they would, you know, we'd come in and make fun of the house or whatever. 
[03:14:30]  And they'd say, oh, can you just come in and say, this is our new palace or welcome to  our new castle or, you know, they like give us words that we'd have to say.  That's great.  Give us words we'd have to say.  We have to see that.  I know.  I want to see it so bad.  Like the theme of the show is Bonnie.  It was called Bonnie Gets Rich.  Yeah.  And so then the beginning is me going like this.  Hi, I'm Bonnie McFarlane and I'm a stand-up comedian. 
[03:15:00]  And guess what?  I married another comedian.  Can you believe it?  Ba-da-ba-da.  Yeah.  Then we had a baby.  I mean, it's like, it's so ridiculous.  And we're moving.  Yeah.  Not really.  I know.  They say we are.  And they moved us to a neighborhood that, I'm not kidding, I think it's where they filmed  The Wire.  That's so funny.  It was, we were like, we had to do a scene in front of a drug store and it was like, we 
[03:15:30]  were scared to get out.  You guys got to put that on like YouTube and do commentary or something.  Well, there's two scenes.  People would watch that.  No, it's too embarrassing.  I know, but now you could like, sort of like, say how bad it was and beat it up a little.  You can see two clips from Comedy Central on my website that are funny.  We're not Comedy Central.  We don't want to see the bad ones.  No, I know you do.  But then there's like these interviews, like, you know, the...  Have you seen our old shit that's up?  Wait, listen, if I bring this...  Listen, remember how we used to do the roast in here?  Yes.  If I bring this in, you have to have Colin and Patrice here or something. 
[03:16:00]  Oh my God, no.  Because I'll bring it.  This would be...  Well, Bonnie, we can see if you can really hang with the guys.  A four-hour fucking...  This would be your hazing.  That would be a good one.  This is the last thing you need to do to join the fraternity.  Bonnie would be hanging from a news.  She's in her head just going, can I just blow you?  It might not have been that bad, though.  I need to have one funny line.  It's like this with me where it's like, it's so...  It's like me sitting there, you know, like, so that they have it in between the scenes. 
[03:16:30]  Yeah.  You know what I'm talking about?  And so that me sitting there being like, I mean, what do I do with the baby?  I don't know.  It's so confusing.  Like, it's...  Remember when me and Kelly walk in with a picture?  Oh, there's so many bad things I can't even.  Wait, what was that one?  Yeah, at least...  Talk about it.  I'll bring it in.  Wait, what was that one?  You and your ex what?  You and Kelly?  Like, first of all, none of it's reality.  They, like, I thought even though I knew they rented us the house, like, everything kind 
[03:17:00]  of went by fast.  At some point, they're like, we're renting you a house.  Like, you know, then it's like shooting day.  I still thought we were going to pretend live in the house while they documented us.  But no, it really was like, okay, walk over here, stand here, say this in front of...  Well, so it's no reality.  It was just none, zero.  That's what they're doing with all these shows.  Yeah, so it's like the Kardashians and stuff, I think, do that.  That's all fake shit.  So they had us...  His ex-wife comes in, and they're hanging a painting in the bedroom, and I have to walk 
[03:17:30]  in and be like, what's going on here?  And stuff.  I mean...  Ew.  I'm not getting too chill.  Was she a good actress, Kelly?  It was like throwing a piano into a room.  It was like...  What?  It was like throwing a piano into a room.  So what happened?  It was obvious they were hot on you guys and put a lot of money into the pilot.  So what happened in the end?  The focus group saw it.  They didn't know what it was.  They didn't know if it was a sitcom or... 
[03:18:00]  So why would they rework it?  They obviously like you two.  Well, no.  I don't know why...  Well, it was the same people, Lifetime, that it had...  When then...  Remember, I just was talking about another show that they wanted me to host, so they still  liked me after it.  And when Rich was trying to get...  It's just the wrong network.  Lifetime is too late.  You need like Comedy Central or TLC or something.  TLC is the freak channel.  Throw it in a house, let it roll, and just see what happens.  And with her and us going on the road with the baby, I have a clip of me and the baby  on stage the other night, and she brought the baby up. 
[03:18:30]  It's as funny as fucking anything.  You know what you ought to check?  IFC, man.  Seriously.  Wait, he says funny as anything.  Where's the clip?  That's one on Comedy Central?  No, it's on this DVD.  I don't know if it's funny as anything.  It was from last night.  No, he goes to Raina.  He's holding her on stage, and he goes, give me a kiss.  She gives me a kiss.  He goes, give me some tongue.  And then she goes like this.  So she knows what that means.  I'm just like, fuck.  And then she started picking her nose.  That is horrible. 
[03:19:00]  And she wiped it on me on stage.  She's picking her nose like her mother.  But kids killing.  That's great.  I'll bring in the lifetime.  If you want a whole day of fucking material.  Is it bad, Bonnie?  Sorry, Bonnie.  It's that bad.  You have to come in for that.  Have to.  I don't know if I can.  Would you be embarrassed?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  I've been embarrassed talking about it.  My heart's pounding.  What am I going to do with the baby?  That's legitimate.  You want to know what to do with the baby?  How about when Kelly was holding the baby?  Yeah.  Kelly was holding the baby, and you walked in on.  I'll bet you that got her ghost.  Oh, they wanted this where Kelly, you know, his ex-wife, is like holding the baby. 
[03:19:30]  We don't know who to watch our baby, and we're going to end up with, like, his ex-wife  is going to do it.  And I walk into the room, and Kelly's, you know, holding the baby and bouncing her, and  I go like this.  Like, you know, one of those, like, moments.  Yeah.  Like, I, you know, they do the takes, like, six or seven times.  You have to, like, do it.  And then, um, I wanted, after I left, for Kelly to be like, say mommy.  Say mommy. 
[03:20:00]  Like, be creepy, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  But they're like, oh, no, we can't have that.  No, that's not a lifetime, like.  No, exactly.  No, but, yeah.  There's, like, sincere moments.  It's got, like, fake sincere moments.  You guys can't give up on this, because someone should pick this shit up.  Rich, Bonnie gets rich.  Oh, my God.  I like that, because it implies money, but you're rich, so she's got you.  But it could mean gets rich, like she understands you.  There's so many fun meanings.  Usually getting rich is a good thing, but in this case, it's terrible.  And not only that, Bonnie was on a mission to do something for herself, and part of the 
[03:20:30]  pilot, or the plot, was to get her a desk.  Oh, yeah.  I don't want to give her a thing.  Well, no, because everyone needs a desk.  Everyone needs a desk.  A whole episode on the desk, Rich.  I want my own space.  So you're trying to get a desk, and now instead of just going out and getting one, which takes  an hour.  Can we please, you have to bring this in?  Can you be back by 10.30?  Yeah, we'll stay late today. 
[03:21:00]  No one will turn off the fucking channel.  I'm telling you.  Got to see it.  We'll bring it.  I'll set it up for a...  Did they think the audience would be sitting there going like, oh, my God, that's his wife.  That's Rich's ex-wife.  Oh, no.  And Bonnie's coming to hold on.  Here it comes!  Like, they pictured that was going to be the big, like, one of the moments.  They did think that.  Well, because you tell stories in these meetings about your life and stuff, and then they want  to just reenact exactly the stories.  Yeah, let's reenact it.  And pretend that it's reality. 
[03:21:30]  Yeah.  You should do that suck my cockpit, Rich.  Oh, God, it was like...  And sometimes they wouldn't have a scene for us to do that'd just be like, okay, you guys  just go in here and be funny.  Or, you know...  And go.  Yeah, like, we wouldn't know.  We wouldn't have any...  You know, it's hard to be real when you've got to hit your mark.  When you're being fake.  Yeah.  Like, it's either real or fake.  Yeah.  So, I would be like, remember that argument we had two weeks ago?  Let's do that. 
[03:22:00]  We'd just be constantly trying to call with something.  So, it's really bad sitcom dialogue that we were writing on the spot.  And the writers were on strike, so the people, the executives at Lifetime had nothing to  do, so we had a bunch of Lifetime executives on the set.  That's always good for the creative process.  Throwing down stuff to the director, to us, and stuff.  Yeah, I think they ought to do this.  Yes.  Or they'd say, Bonnie's being too mean to Rich's daughters.  You know, if I ever said anything funny to them, they'd think that I was being mean to  them. 
[03:22:30]  Right.  Funny is mean, so...  Fucking assholes.  Yeah, well, call me something to a word.  I mean, you two for not making that work.  Yeah.  Sounds like a great guy.  The thing was, it's like, if you want to do it fake like that, why don't you just do  Larry David style?  Like, why don't you just put a little bit of pre-production in and then do it?  Yeah.  I mean, it seems weird that they think, like...  What's going on?  Someone's coming to the door.  Oh, it seems...  Rich is gesticulating.  Wow.  Wow.  Very...  It seems weird that they think, like, oh, it's going to be better if we try to do it 
[03:23:00]  like a movie, but you're going to make it up.  Yeah, so that a focus group doesn't know what the fuck they're watching.  At first...  And then they think they have to tell the audience it's real.  Like, they have to...  Like, they can't let on for a second that this might not be real.  And not only that, the fact that they use fucking focus groups that are clueless for  anything, you know what I mean?  Maybe to test, like, toothpaste or something.  Rich, they might be heroin addicts, but they're not clueless. 
[03:23:30]  No.  It's ridiculous that they can't make the right decision as executives.  I remember when I used to make you laugh.  What's that?  I remember when I used to make you laugh.  You still make me laugh.  Well, you haven't laughed once at her jokes.  That's true.  I laughed today a couple times.  Not really.  When?  Not really.  We keep trying.  Huh?  She's been trying to please you with jokes.  We've been laughing our asses off.  I showed you my ass.  You've just shunned her.  I showed your friends my ass.  That's when you laughed.  You laughed when she showed her ass.  Great.  How funny is her ass?  How do you know about the inside of my house? 
[03:24:00]  Especially when it starts talking to me.  Oh, it's got you a little nervous, doesn't it?  I knew the OCD with the kids.  It's got you a little nervous, doesn't it?  What do you mean the inside?  Like, how do you know about my cow...  Because I had a picture on Grace.  Tom, leave an email with.  No, you guys did not email my daughter.  My daughter doesn't do email.  Rich, I'll tell you this much.  It leads to something.  Are you still paranoid of Bonnie?  And do you trust her finally?  What about the neighbor?  Remember how the neighbor knew your tiled floor?  Yeah, that's what we're getting at.  I always remember how you got so upset that the neighbor knew that you had tiled the floor  when you had never been in the house.  Not the floor, the kitchen. 
[03:24:30]  Whatever the fuck it was.  Can I say something about that?  Yeah.  The neighbor, he's the rudest guy.  Like, he won't say hi.  He won't talk.  He's totally a loner.  Like, he's either more of an asshole than you are, Rich, or he heard that whole thing  on the radio.  Oh, shit.  And now he's, like, scared to even, like, make eye contact or have any kind of...  That happens.  This show fucks a lot of stuff up because my neighbor, now, they just don't even talk to  me or acknowledge me.  Because they think you're a not-so.  I think, yeah. 
[03:25:00]  They do?  Yeah.  Well, think.  Exactly.  Maybe it's the fucking fact that Downfall has played on an 11-foot screen.  Do you trust her?  Volume blasting.  Huh?  You trust her?  Why?  What do you know?  You're paranoid.  Every guy's paranoid.  Wait a minute.  Do you still have the fucking plastic cover on that screen?  I put a new one on it.  Well, just take it off.  It's a trio.  Jesus.  Who cares if you scratch it up?  What's wrong with you?  I break a lot of these. 
[03:25:30]  At least you can see it.  I like when people put plastic over something and the plastic becomes so fucked up that you  can't even see it anymore.  Anyway.  I trust her, you know.  But once we do the DNA test.  I'm willing to do it at any time.  That's why I keep picking my nose.  No, I don't give DNA.  It's not your DNA, dummy.  DNA for what?  The baby.  But she had the baby.  Huh?  So you know it's hers.  I know it's mine.  But it looks like you.  It doesn't look like me at all.  No one's once said the baby looks like me. 
[03:26:00]  Are you crazy?  She's taller than you.  She's smarter than you.  No one's once said Raina looks like me.  She can't read.  I think she is yours.  Are you kidding me?  What?  You think Raina looks like me?  That baby?  I mean, our baby?  Or her baby?  She looks way more like you than Bonnie.  Oh my God.  Whoa.  Andrew does clay.  Is that the father?  You don't think this kid looks like you?  That dumb video me and you filmed on the street?  Yeah.  It's so obvious it's your kid. 
[03:26:30]  Could you get a picture of this somehow?  Where's the latest picture?  Raina?  At home.  I got tons of them on my account.  No, I just downloaded them to my computer.  But there's a part of your brain that thinks that it might not be your kid.  Rich, you can get a DNA test literally from the drugstore.  From Target.  So why don't I just go get one and we'll do it?  Because I would never do a DNA test.  Here's the thing about a DNA test.  No, because if it comes out where it's your baby, then you're wrong and you're pissed.  No, that's why you just get the DNA test.  Because I'll tell you why you don't do a DNA test. 
[03:27:00]  Why?  Because if you get it, okay, say it is my baby, then our relationship isn't as strong as it is  because she thought I didn't trust her.  No.  Okay?  That's not it.  Well, I don't think you...  So it's not as strong because you don't trust her.  I trust you as my wife, but as a woman, you can't trust any woman in life.  Here's the problem.  You don't want to be proved wrong.  That's the problem.  You don't want to be proved wrong.  You're crazy.  You think you could trust any woman in life?  But you're crazy.  You're insane. 
[03:27:30]  I'm not insane.  You're how insulting that is to Bonnie.  I'm not sure if it's your kid.  I love her as my wife.  Yeah, she says that's insulting.  And the kid has dark skin and has the same eyes as you.  Oh, there's not a lot of Puerto Ricans in my neighborhood.  Oh, God.  You are terrible, man.  Well, first of all, we've never seen a Puerto Rican.  We've only seen just the dirty diapers on the ground.  See, the thing is, now, if you get a DNA test and the baby is yours, then you've got no 
[03:28:00]  reason to be fucking mistreated.  Then I can go get the tattoo of her name right now, but that's the problem, is that you won't  have any reason to fucking feel that way.  No, that's not true.  Then you won't have a craziness to constantly...  And what happens, just say the slim, let's be crazy.  Don't wave your hands like that.  Let's be crazy.  Right.  Okay?  That somebody roofied me one night.  It wasn't mine.  I had sex in my front.  My whole life would change.  Everything would be upside down, and it would cost me a fortune.  So, but then you'd at least know.  Just get the test. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah, I'm not doing the test.  You don't want to be proven wrong.  You know it's your baby.  What are the percentages in your head?  It's this way he doesn't feel guilty when he goes golfing every day.  It might not be my baby.  What percent do you believe that's your kid?  You don't want to be proven wrong.  No, that's not true.  I'm too nervous to do it.  I think Norton nailed it.  No, because if she would...  You actually said it first.  She would actually do the test, and she doesn't seem to care.  No, she would...  You know what would happen?  Say we did the test, and it came back not mine.  She'd go, oh, it's bullshit.  The test is wrong.  Well, it's from Target. 
[03:29:00]  But why don't you want to show us your outfit?  Yeah, it's all about Walmart.  These two.  By the way, this is the first episode of your TV show.  This is the first episode of your TV show.  You got so filmed for Walmart.  I say it in meetings.  I think like, yeah, like that's...  Who wouldn't watch that?  DNA testing from Target?  That's hilarious.  Because Rich is...  This isn't a bit. 
[03:29:30]  Rich, part of him thinks it might not be his kid, which is just insane to me.  No, any parent...  I can't hang out with you or play golf anymore, because you're scary.  You've had 20 reasons you can't play golf on me, but no one else will play with you.  True.  I was hurtful.  But true.  Every guy that has a baby, and you could ask any guy, okay, because none of you have kids,  all right?  Any guy, there's a part of him that says, that might not be mine.  Yeah, that's Kenny has kids.  He has Kenny.  At one point, maybe... 
[03:30:00]  Danny, it's a dumb video on the YouTube channel, but at the end, you could see Rich and the  baby.  It's a close-up.  Can we just get to that point of freeze frame, if you can find it, while we continue talking?  When you had your kids in the beginning, right, when they were infants, was there any part  of you that thought maybe they could not be your kids, or one of them, or whatever?  I still love them like my own.  You're an asshole. 
[03:30:30]  The man of few thoughts.  You're serious about this, though.  You really have doubts.  All my kids.  No, he doesn't.  All your kids.  He just wants an excuse not to trust women.  Which I'm not saying your mothers didn't mess up.  Your mom fucked you up so badly.  I mean, I trust Bonnie.  Bonnie is...  I'm not lying.  He wouldn't be one of them either.  He's the best girl I've ever been with.  I'm not lying.  I'm not fucking lying.  Stop pointing, you asshole.  We, like, we'll watch movies... 
[03:31:00]  Oh, there you go.  Stop.  You don't even have to look at the video.  Oh, yeah.  See?  Let's see.  How do you not think that's your kid?  First of all, doesn't that kid look like the kid from Waterworld?  No, no, Mel Gibson, the one that was throwing the boomerang.  Oh, my God.  From the road where he's a little feral kid?  Yeah.  We're looking at a picture of Rich in this kid.  She doesn't look like him at all.  Huh?  She doesn't look like you.  I told you, see?  No, she doesn't look like Rich at all.  At all.  The nose is completely different.  Well, can I say something? 
[03:31:30]  She looks like Ellen.  You don't see it in the eyes?  No, there's nothing in the eyes.  No.  See?  See how Bonnie's scrambling now?  Okay, okay.  Here's the thing.  No, I don't see it at all.  Tell me how that baby looks like me.  She's beautiful.  The eyes are exactly the same.  Doesn't look anything like me.  The shape of the eyes are exactly the same.  She has blue eyes.  Does Bonnie have blue eyes?  No, I don't have blue eyes.  Yeah, you both have bags on your eyes.  Wait, what color eyes do you have?  I have hazel.  All right. 
[03:32:00]  I have hazel.  I'm trying to see if maybe she got a lot of Bonnie's looks.  No, Bonnie.  She doesn't look like me either.  I'm looking going, no.  Well, you don't see Rich in the eyes for real.  Maybe they switched him.  Maybe they switched your baby.  Oh, shit.  No, I followed her from coming out of her stomach.  Stomach.  I was in the delivery room.  You're fucking child.  We originally had a butter face, and I said, can we do something?  I followed the stork.  See, now, if you...  Okay, if you had a baby, throughout light, I mean, since the baby was born, everybody, 
[03:32:30]  not everybody says, well, she doesn't look like you, wouldn't that subconsciously get  in the back of your head?  Yeah, then you get the DNA test and shut up.  But the thing is, is that you used to have a really fat...  In the back of your head, you didn't have to say it.  You used to have a really fat face when you were little.  You used to have nice hair, so what are you trying to say?  It's growing out.  Okay, no, but now you've got...  I'm looking at her short, by the way.  Thank you.  Jesus Christ.  Why do I have to give her all the colors? 
[03:33:00]  I know.  I feel like I've got to come here to get my self-esteem back.  So, now you've got a very, you know, thin...  Gaunt, sickly.  You've got that AIDS look, and...  Oh, shit.  But she looks like your father, and she looks like Ellen.  Maybe my father's your father.  I think she takes after Kelly.  I think she looks a lot.  Well, she doesn't look like me, and everybody says it.  I'm going to tweet the picture, so people can make your own decisions.  Fuck it, I'm done.  I'm tired.  She's not your kid, I admit it.  Opie Radio, I'm clear. 
[03:33:30]  Who's the father?  She looks like Kyle Dunning in a little bit.  Kyle Dunning in just...  Jimmy could be a Canadian comedian.  I can see how Jimmy could be the dad.  It's Jimmy.  Because the kid has no chin.  Cute little round face like Jimmy.  Look at that.  And she's fisting something.  Yeah, there's nothing that looks like you.  Really?  Except the hand size.  I see it right in the eyes, man.  She is cute. 
[03:34:00]  Who, her?  But, okay, let's say you have some...  Maybe...  Oh, God.  Maybe this kid's not mine.  It's like, she's so adorable.  Yeah.  How could you, like, wouldn't you just stuff that down?  Deny it to be her father?  You see what I mean?  See, that's the kind of stuff that someone says that's setting themselves up.  I'm telling you, he's nuts.  Who would say that?  You're scary.  Who would say that?  I see what you're saying.  I'll face it with you in the mental health.  I mean, if what you're saying is true, that every man thinks maybe whatever, it's not 
[03:34:30]  your kid.  There's a lot of cute kids throughout the world.  I'm not going, hey, I want to be your father.  You know, she's a cute kid, and I fucking love her, but don't...  See how she's covering her?  You know what I'm saying.  Yeah, I mean, I don't think she's covering her, but I understand definitely what you're  saying.  I mean, when someone says that, when someone says, how could you not think, you know,  there could be a problem, when she goes, even if she's not your kid, well, what the  fuck?  Who would say that?  Someone covering their tracks.  Yeah, see? 
[03:35:00]  Oh, you guys are so turning on me.  Oh, you're setting her up for a night of hell.  First of all, because I can't get through to you that she's yours.  I've offered to do DNA testing.  I've offered everything.  Yeah, of course you offer.  I've offered everything.  That's a bluff.  You're not going to go...  So now I'm saying, I'm trying to help you get beyond it.  That's all.  Psychologically.  Here's another thing, too.  Stuff it down.  That's what I think you should do with your anger, and that's what I think you should  do with your doubts about your daughter.  Stuff it.  You've never heard that?  Stuff it down.  Push them up.  What I'm saying is, of course you're going to go, yeah, do a DNA test. 
[03:35:30]  That's fucking like reverse psychology.  She's going to go, no, no, don't, don't, don't.  Of course you're going to go, yeah, go ahead, do it.  Yeah, I'm for it.  I understand your point, though, because she's like, but even if it wasn't, anytime someone  says that, it's like, eh, why would she say that if it was 100%?  Like, even if it's not, eh.  Yeah.  See, now you're starting to lean towards me.  I'm 99% sure.  That's not enough for you?  What's that?  99% sure.  That's your kid.  She's reasonably sure the father was Caucasian.  Yeah.  There's two other people that it might be, but... 
[03:36:00]  Rich, you're nuts.  That is so your kid.  Like, it's almost amazing that that tiny little bit of sperm that you shoot out can make a baby.  Because Rich doesn't have big kids.  The fact that you found it on your chest and scraped it into your sledge.  Oh, Rich.  Wait, Rich doesn't have big loads?  Does Rich have little cumzies?  Yeah, let's hear about his cumzies.  I don't know.  I don't know where to go with this. 
[03:36:30]  More than a mouthful is a waste.  How would you know?  You never swallowed it.  No.  She fucking fakes blowjobs.  She does hand and mouth.  It's a fucking half a blowjob.  My dick is so big, sweetie.  Oh, okay.  That's how you do it.  She's fucking cool.  It's like being married to a dude, though.  It really is.  And you really want to be married to an asshole.  Without the most important thing.  If I could grow a full beard, you'd be so happy to be.  Quit shaving. 
[03:37:00]  What about a strap-on, Rich?  What's that?  Would you have her wear a strap-on for you?  Why?  Because she's just put it in her hand.  Why take a chance of it falling off?  Jesus.  No, but at first I thought you meant he should wear a strap-on, which I kind of agreed with.  Do they have those?  Oh, she wants you to wear the strap-on.  Take a chance of it falling off. 
[03:37:30]  Fucking Rich.  Rich has killed me.  I don't even get it.  Holy shit.  Someone on the phone says 10% of the population, the father is not the husband.  10%?  10%.  Let's say hi to JD in Atlanta. 
[03:38:00]  He is calling from Atlanta, though.  Hotlanta.  Check it in.  Freak Nick.  Yeah, I was just going to let you know that if you look it up online, the studies say that  10% of the population is actually someone that's fathered other than the husband's father.  Really?  So that means 90% is R.  Yeah, so it's in your favor.  That's right.  Joe Vega just texted me.  I slept with Bonnie. 
[03:38:30]  I want to text.  Joey Vega?  Yeah.  I slept with Bonnie.  I want to text.  Vegas is a funny Asian comment.  Do you know how pissed at my pussy I'd have to be to sleep with Joey Vega?  To do a stock line like that?  Very pissed.  You fucking bodak.  I'm getting seasick listening to you.  Take a fucking break.  It's your line, you face.  Okay.  That's hilarious.  When I wrote it, okay, then it turned into a stock line.  Wrote it.  With a quill? 
[03:39:00]  Sometimes you fucking wrote something.  When you gave it to that messenger on a horse.  I'll send this out to the king.  Foss is right.  It's a common thought among fathers that the child isn't theirs.  Colin in Tampa.  There you go.  And the way the things she says, it just feeds into the, you know, insecurity.  I'm getting chest pains.  I'm telling you, if you don't stop doing it, I'm going to, as soon as she's old enough 
[03:39:30]  to understand, I'm going to go, he doesn't think he's your daddy.  He doesn't want to be your daddy.  Don't give a false hope.  All right.  Who do you think is the father of your child?  Could be one of many.  Any ideas?  One of many?  One of many.  Well, because we've been together for years, so we've, our travels, who the fuck knows?  Yeah, but you're always, like, I'm in a prison.  I mean, yeah.  When we're on the road and I go play golf, maybe a club owner came around. 
[03:40:00]  Excuse me.  Who farted?  Rich.  Oh, I was rich.  I thought for a second it was Bonnie.  That would have ruled.  She took the blame for it.  That's why.  Oh, God.  You know, we're on the road.  But these are real thoughts in your head.  It might be a club owner.  Yeah, I got a list.  Then stop playing golf.  What?  No, it's too late now.  Based on the looks, on your child's looks, do you have any idea of who you think it might  be?  Does it, does it, does the baby look like someone you know?  It looks, she looks most like the guy, uh, the club owner in North Carolina. 
[03:40:30]  But that doesn't mean, oh, look at how Rich looked at her.  Rich just spun around and, oh, man.  This is the first show of a fucking very successful TV show.  I can't, what do I, I try to joke about it, make a, you know, I can't, there's no winning.  It's just this endless.  Just forget about it.  I'm getting anxiety and chest pain.  So what if it's not yours?  You'll love it anyway.  You think the father, you think the father might be Mike Birbiglia or?  Ugh, no.  The baby has a sense of humor. 
[03:41:00]  Oh, I thought that was funny.  It would have been funny if Travis wasn't yelling in my ears when the punchline happened.  I don't know.  He hit the wrong button.  Oh, Travis just had a baby.  You know what?  Travis and Lisa just had a, oh, yeah, I think a 35-pound son, fucking a giant teenager  fell out.  Oh, congratulations.  Thanks, Rich.  And do you have any doubts, Travis?  No.  Okay, see?  Why would I?  There you go.  Why don't you trust your wife?  Oh, thank you, Dr. Phil.  You're welcome.  Yeah.  You got to trust your wife.  Yeah.  You know. 
[03:41:30]  Yeah, that's what marriage is all about.  You got to have that trust thing.  But then again, Rich is like me in the sense that.  Whoa.  I've never heard anyone say that before.  We both.  In the sense that, like, we've been on all those years doing comedy, I've seen married  women behave fucking despicably.  Yeah.  Like, I have trouble trusting the institution of marriage.  I don't give a fuck who the woman is.  No married woman that I've ever hooked up with in my life, and this is since the beginning  of doing comedy. 
[03:42:00]  Their husbands believe them as much as any husband believes his faithful wife.  Oh, boy.  It's like, I've seen their ability to be deceptive.  But people are deceptive.  On stage, I've seen girls at bachelorette parties that will fuck you at their bachelorette  party.  Yeah.  I've seen them.  I've seen women come on to me.  But it's so weird, Rich, because you know why?  Like, I honestly...  No, I'm not saying you, but just...  But even if I found a pair of women's underwear stuck in your pant, like, while I was doing  your laundry, I'd be like, I wouldn't think you had an affair.  Well, you know he wears them. 
[03:42:30]  That's exactly...  I think, like, oh, no, now we have to start dealing with this whole, like, sex change thing.  No, you wouldn't.  I wouldn't think you cheated.  No, I wouldn't.  That would absolutely not be my first life.  Because men, you could trust men more than women.  Oh, Jesus, Rich.  Well, no, no, no.  That was wrong.  That was wrong.  What I'm saying is, the difference is, if I cheated, there wouldn't be a baby, like...  What?  No consequences?  Is that what you're saying?  No, no, no.  Like, I'm not going to come home with a baby and go, hey, this is yours. 
[03:43:00]  You know what I mean?  All right.  That's the difference, but...  No, it's not a good...  The thing is, your cheating would be unprovable.  Hers is almost provable that she didn't do it.  Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Alleged.  But you know what I'm saying?  It's almost provable that she didn't do it because you get the test.  It's like, if you came home with whatever lipstick on your fucking collar, whatever,  a hack thing that happens to her husband's, you could just deny it and she could go, you  did it.  But now that there's a baby, you could go this DNA test it.  That's 100% answers your question. 
[03:43:30]  So you could completely prove her correct.  Like, I would have to, like...  If you cheated on me, I would have to go dig up that whore's body.  I don't know.  Why wouldn't you just get tested and have the test on that?  That's a great true nerve-wracking to win.  Why is it too nerve-wracking?  What's wrong with you?  Because now you're really not trusting.  Yeah, now you're already buying clothes for a kid who probably isn't yours.  This isn't even something where you're like, oh, I got a little element of doubt, so,  you know, the test would make me nervous. 
[03:44:00]  You're thinking that's going to come back, not your kid.  No, he's not, because you know why?  He really doesn't, I think he 100% knows it's his kid.  Because there's absolutely nowhere along the line of I give you, ever giving you any indication  ever that I...  Not answering your phone?  Not answering my phone.  That's...  Doesn't mean she's getting deep dicks.  That's right.  And every time, there was a couple times in LA, there's a couple times when, like, I picked  her up from a hotel where she went to meet her friend at, at a hotel. 
[03:44:30]  My female friend, best friend, Lynn Chaka.  But I don't know if she was even in the hotel, but when I picked her up and she was...  We got...  She got crazy a couple times.  Because you started in on me about where was I, who was I with, going on.  It's like, enough already.  But she started smashing, you know, and twice.  Because you've been calling 100 times, you wouldn't let it go.  I didn't call 100 times.  Do you understand how frustrating it gets when you're innocent and someone's constantly...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's like, and you can't...  Actually, no, I don't know what that's like. 
[03:45:00]  It's called being a Jew.  No, but I can't...  No, I haven't done it lately.  I've been good with you.  Like, if there's, like, a match on the floor somewhere in our house or something, like,  he's like, ah, how did this get here?  It's like, there's been workmen in all week.  Yeah.  Sure.  Is that what you're called?  Was your mom cheating on your dad?  We're not having work done.  Do you know what I mean?  Did your mom cheat on your dad?  I don't think so.  No, his dad cheated on his mom, right?  I don't know about that either.  I don't know.  They didn't tell me that kind of shit. 
[03:45:30]  So, um, so he, uh, is when you were with your friend Lynn, that's Mitch's ex-wife, right?  Yeah.  Mitch's wife.  I mean, uh, so, so he would call you while you were with her and you'd look at the phone  and see his number?  I'd have to, like, get her to talk on the, you know, hold it up.  No, not that day at the hotel, though.  Yes, make sure I was there.  DancingBear.com.  What's DancingBear?  What is that?  That's just something.  It's something to do with me?  Uh, Bonnie.  Wow.  I will say this.  Sorry.  What is that?  What?  What is that? 
[03:46:00]  What is it?  Ladies.  It's a lucky girl.  No.  This is what they do at bachelorette parties.  Oh, is that what it's about?  Just to make Ritz even more.  Yeah, I saw a girl give us a male stripper head once.  Yeah, she's just got her tongue out.  This guy's laying his dick on her.  And then some guy's going to fucking marry her tomorrow.  Yeah.  With fucking Chippendale cock on her breath.  Okay, but Rich, I am not attracted to good-looking men.  Look at the cock head on the top of her head. 
[03:46:30]  I like the other one with the cock on her face.  Like, no.  You can tell you're doing radio because no one's even listening to Bonnie now.  We're looking at blowjob pictures.  Anyway, guys, another thing I wanted to tell you.  Look at the fucking abs.  Look at that chick just sucking that fucking...  Look at his fucking abs.  Look at those abs.  Holy fuck.  Don't pretend you're looking at abs.  The whole fucking package.  Well, that's why he's a male stripper.  Look at those fucking abs, man.  Can you imagine having those?  What the fuck is going on? 
[03:47:00]  That's what happens at bachelorette parties.  That's it, huh?  So, and what Norton was saying, I said that to Bonnie, that you see so many women.  But why would you marry someone that you thought was capable of that?  Like, I would never have married you if I thought that...  Listen, I used to play craps, and I took a chance of losing because I love craps.  I love you, so you still got to take that chance in life when you love somebody.  You know, it's like shooting craps.  You know what I'm saying?  It's so romantic.  Yeah.  It's too. 
[03:47:30]  Oh, my God.  It's just like shooting craps.  I mean, the odds are in your favor that one out of the three kids you have isn't yours, so...  I think it's Ellen.  That wouldn't be in my favor.  It's in your favor.  That's not.  Yeah, that's not in my favor.  You better hope it's the one that you haven't put money aside for college yet.  Oh.  I don't know.  Never mind.  Keep going.  Wait, what do you mean?  He didn't put money aside for someone?  No, I was saying, like, he's got to pay... 
[03:48:00]  If he finds out one of them's not his, he's not going to pay for college.  I would never check those guys from...  I fucking love them.  They're checking out the picture I tweeted, and it's like 50-50.  Half thing that you're getting, and the other half say no fucking way.  Yeah, and the ones that say no way are doctors.  Yeah, exactly.  The real father.  I think you guys...  Honestly, I think you guys have the exact same eyes.  If the real father was a doctor, I'd fucking be out of it.  Yeah, really?  Why would she stick around?  Yeah, why don't I just go with the real father?  Because she probably doesn't have money. 
[03:48:30]  A fling doesn't mean that the fucking guy's got money and stuff.  I take care of you, man.  Look at what you...  He couldn't be a cop with a bleaker future.  I know.  Yeah, look at...  At least somebody else would have hope.  Look at her hot phone with the stylus.  Oh, jeez.  Hell of a lifestyle.  Whatever.  We have a nice thing going.  You don't have a nice thing going.  I think you should...  No, there's no trust.  Just trust her, Rich.  Get tested.  Do you think these stripper guys just fucking take Viagra or Cialis?  They have to.  Because it's like, how could they stay hard just walking around with pigs? 
[03:49:00]  Oh, yes, Savani.  I know the answer.  Yes, Savani?  They put a ring around there.  Cock ring?  Well, they get them hard, and then they put something that holds it tied off.  I have a cock ring that I kind of...  I haven't used it in a while.  What's his name?  That was hurtful.  Yeah, exactly.  What the fuck?  We're just trying to have fun here today.  It's rubber.  Yeah, don't fucking get caught in the hairs.  I don't have hair. 
[03:49:30]  What the fuck's wrong with you?  You don't have hair?  David!  Ew.  Cubes?  Oh, it's all gone.  You shave your pube hairs?  All gone.  It looks like you.  All gone?  All gone.  But you shave it every day?  I trim it up a little bit, but...  No, I'm not very hairy to begin with, but I shave every other day or third day.  It's easy.  I don't get it either.  My balls are not hairy either.  I can understand, like, getting clippers and getting rid of, like, if you got fucking a  lot of rambunctious hairs.  Yeah, yeah, clean it up.  Clean it up.  Yeah, yeah, clean the yard up a little bit. 
[03:50:00]  But you don't have to go down to the fucking topsoil.  It's totally bare.  Really?  I'm not going to fuzz.  Let's see.  I have a day or two worth, maybe.  But I'll shave it again.  Yeah.  Do you get embarrassed when you've got a little fuzz and you...  For me, it's all how it feels.  Like, if I can feel it, I don't like the way it feels.  Yeah.  First of all, don't you get, like, chafed from where hairs are kind of growing in, like...  No.  ...little stubbles on your...  No.  Can you let it out?  But, like, okay, can I just, like, look at that package. 
[03:50:30]  If you just saw that, would you go, that guy definitely shaves his balls out?  For me?  Yeah.  Well, I'm not hairy.  No.  You're, like...  You called him a package?  Well, she means it's, like, a whole thing of shit.  Yeah.  It's just, like, a pile of shit with a really nice ball.  My balls are not hairy at all.  I very rarely have to shave them.  There's very little.  Can you, Barry, if you want to say something into the mic so you can say you did O&A radio  to your friends, go ahead.  You know, if you want to just, like, if you have a comment or something, you don't have 
[03:51:00]  to just...  Because you're a comic.  Would you...  If you had a baby, would you feel a little...  Like it wasn't yours?  Okay, that's all the time we've got.  Why did you have to go there?  I wanted to put him on the spot.  But you put yourself on the spot.  Yes.  Yeah.  Sure, put him on the spot, all right.  Boy, you showed him.  Why don't you learn a little something from the pro, Barry?  Let me teach you something, kid. 
[03:51:30]  Why is that guy sitting here the whole show?  Because it's Bonnie's...  You don't notice him at home?  You don't see the resemblance?  You don't see him cleaning up the yard?  Oh, shit.  Oh, is he Mexican?  I don't know what he is.  I'm sorry, sir.  Where are you from?  Venezuela.  Nehra.  Nehra.  We started with that shit.  Yes.  All right, we could do this all day, but we shouldn't.  Yeah, let's... 
[03:52:00]  I'm going to go home.  Yeah.  Rich and Bonnie, a pleasure.  I think you guys should have a TV show.  Yeah, a real one.  Not a bullshit, fake house, crap thing.  I believe in...  Thank you, guys.  I believe in the cockumentary project that you're doing.  Thank you.  Yeah, it's going well.  These guys know what they're doing.  I completely believe in it.  I think you've got something on your hands there.  Is it bad that I thought, like, right when Bonnie walked in, she's wearing white pants,  she's not on her period?  I'm not.  Like, is that a bad thing?  I...  Every month when she gets her period, I'm going, well, great. 
[03:52:30]  Yeah, really?  Why?  Because I go off in my cave.  You go to your period cave?  I go to my period.  I go on the ice floe.  That's it.  Go to your period cave.  Don't come out until you're fucking done.  Any plugs?  Oh, I'll be at Mardi Gras in fucking Scottsdale, August 1st, Saturday.  Is that August 1st, that Saturday?  Whatever.  August 1st.  RichRoss.com, right?  Yep.  Mardi Gras.  Bonnie?  It's going to be great.  I'm just plugging up the blood flow. 
[03:53:00]  That's it.  Well, you're somewhere.  I'm not bringing you anywhere.  Aren't you guys playing locally?  Tuesday, we're at comics.  No.  Oh, don't come.  Don't come.  Don't come.  Governor's not told, but I'm there, not her.  I'm trying to think.  You're confusing everyone.  Here's how you do it.  This weekend, I'm in Zaney's in Vernon Hills, Illinois.  The following weekend, 23 through 25, Punchline Atlanta, July 31, August 1, Manhattan Comedy  Club in Middletown, New York. 
[03:53:30]  That's my buddy, Rich Franchise.  Oh, you're going to do it?  I want to do it, yeah.  Oh, cool.  I heard it's a great club, so.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, good.  All right.  That's fucking cool.  Have you done it?  Yeah, I was in the beginning.  Yeah, I'm going to back there, and then I got an ultimatum from other people, and it's  just like, fuck, you know what?  Don't tell me what to do.  I got to fucking kids.  I got to earn a living.  Bonnie.  Yeah, plus Rich is a friend for 15 years.  Yeah, what the fuck?  Yeah, we got good stuff, you know, that's coming up, you know, good things.  Just movies.  It's going to be fucking hilarious. 
[03:54:00]  Oh, they turned me off.  What movie?  The show ended.  It did?  Yeah.  That was funny.  What movie?  Yeah, what movie's going to be funny?  Yes, documentary.  Oh, the documentary, yeah.  Cocumentary.  Cocumentary.  Oh, thank you guys very much.  We got time.  Yeah.  I'll bring in that Lifetime video.  Oh, I want to see that.  Fucking horrible.  Definitely want to see that.  And then I cut you off a couple times that story.  Bonnie, that doesn't matter at all. 
[03:54:30]  You say whatever you want.  Yeah, you're the funny one out of the two, anyway.  That's right.  You say whatever you want.  I told her in the beginning when she used to come in here.  He scared the shit out of me.  No matter what you do, you do not cut Anthony off.  No!  What a dick.  Why don't I just watch your mouth?  Watch your mouth.  Watch my mouth.  That's terrible.  You're an awful man, Richard.  You guys got to bring in that tape, though. 
[03:55:00]  Can you test him?  Yeah.  At 11 o'clock.  I got to do two, actually.  I got to do two, actually.  I got to do two.  I got to do two, actually.  Okay.  Oh.  I got to do two, actually.  Okay. </pre>
