<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a conversation with Bryan Cranston, focusing on his role in *Breaking Bad*.  Cranston discussed the character's transformation, the show's dark themes, and the acting challenges involved. He also talked about other roles, including his work on *Madagascar 3*,  participating in humorous banter with the hosts.

Following this, Opie shared an embarrassing anecdote about his teenage obsession with the Thompson Twins' "Hold Me Now,"  revealing the song lyrics were prominently displayed in his college dorm. This led to humorous discussion about Opie's past and his radio career.  The hosts then recounted Opie's infamous misidentification of Ice-T as Ice-Cube, contrasting it with a similar anecdote involving Jim Norton misidentifying a guest.  The segment concluded with speculation about an upcoming rumor concerning E-Rock, interspersed with various comedic bits and off-topic conversations.

The show then transitioned into a best-of compilation from summer 2012.  This section revisited Opie's "Ice-Q" gaffe, replaying the audio and highlighting Jim Brewer's reactions.  Studio guest Dennis Leary, promoting a Spider-Man project, participated in the discussion.  Brewer also discussed his 45th birthday and a concerning situation involving his 13-year-old daughter and a 12-year-old boy.

The conversation shifted to Brewer's documentary, "Him and His Old Man," about his World War II veteran father. Leary, Brewer, and the hosts shared anecdotes about Brewer's father, his inappropriate humor, confrontational nature (including a story about a run-in with the Delapines gang), and his interaction with Paula Abdul at an SNL party.  The segment concluded with a montage of Chip's Comic-Con interviews, showcasing his unusual interviewing style and attire (frog hat, mustache, elephant hat) and generally irreverent approach.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  There he is.  Oh my God.  You know what?  I am so psyched.  Guess what?  I've seen a couple episodes.  I have been privy to the first two episodes.  Really?  And let me tell you something.  I was, I was, the second the first one came on, I'm like, yes, finally.  Because, you know, that long wait between seasons, it's not easy for us.  How long was the wait?  No.  We don't know how this goes. 
[00:00:30]  So we have to wait.  But how long was the wait?  In between seasons.  A year.  Like a year.  That's doable.  Full calendar.  It's not doable.  It's a year.  It's doable.  Crazy.  What about the Sopranos and The Wire?  Exactly.  They got a little longer than a year.  Sopranos would be 16 months sometimes.  Oh, it's brutal.  Listen, I brought a little something for you guys.  So if you wait a year, you can still have a little.  I would love some of your.  A little teenth of our product.  Some of your product.  My friend, that's for you.  That's wonderful. 
[00:01:00]  Oh, man.  Wow, you got actual product.  You got actual product.  Nice.  It's rock candy.  Oh, that is.  I'm keeping it.  Are you going to eat it?  You can call it rock candy if you want.  I'm going to smoke it.  That's the good stuff.  What did I see you in recently?  You were in something else, weren't you?  You were in a film recently?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I have a couple things out.  I have Rock of Ages.  That's out now.  And also Madagascar 3.  You have my voice.  Oh, really?  I play the Russian tiger.  Oh, man.  Listen to me.  Yes.  You are not circus animal.  Your kids love it. 
[00:01:30]  I got a kid.  You got a kid.  We talk about how, with guys that come in that do cartoon voices, how just printing  money that is.  It is the best.  You roll out of bed, literally.  You don't even have to wipe the sleep out of your eyes.  It's like you have a cup of coffee in one hand, and you're like, what?  What is that?  Bigger.  Rawr!  Good.  All right.  Next.  How did they know you could do Russian?  Did they say, we need you to do Russian, or you just made them Russian? 
[00:02:00]  They kind of asked me to do it.  And he said, what characters would you be interested in?  Here's a Russian tiger.  Here's this guy and that guy.  And I said, how about the Russian tiger?  That sounds fun.  You did sound like this.  I'm like this.  Hey, comrade.  That's good.  Very KGB.  Old school Soviet Russian.  And a little, like a tiger growl to it.  So you go, listen to me.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, shit.  That's pretty good.  I can see that animated.  You ever see Yakov Shmiernoff down there in Branson, Missouri? 
[00:02:30]  I haven't seen.  Apparently he's got magnetic dinner trays and genuine linen napkins.  That would be lovely, wouldn't it?  Vegetable medley.  You might want to look it up online.  There's something going on down there.  It's a great video.  It's like a cult.  That whole city's a cult.  Well, Breaking Bad.  When is it premiere?  Because I don't, I already.  Premieres Sunday at 10 p.m. on AMC.  And we love AMC.  Very excited.  And we love Dish Network.  We love them all.  Now, last time, we don't love Dish.  They cut us out.  That's right.  See, I'm with Brian Creston. 
[00:03:00]  Someone has to take his side.  You know, without getting too far into it.  And I really don't know.  There is a huge settlement that was, that came down a little while ago against Dish and for  our parent company at AMC.  And so it feels a little punitive that they're trying to punish AMC networks.  They're just cutting them all off.  Cutting them off.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  So Walking Dead, Mad Men, all that is all gone. 
[00:03:30]  Isn't that bad for Dish?  No one wants to see those shows.  That's not true.  They don't really want to see those shows.  But they're a sponsor.  It's got to play the side of the sponsor.  Yeah, what are you going to do?  I just do the library.  And we're desperate, sir.  Are you?  Not really.  Now, last time you were in, you were talking about Walt and how you were getting really,  really over the deep end.  And very, very bad.  And I'm seeing this happen. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  With the first two episodes I saw.  No spoilers.  Don't worry, people.  You don't have to change the channel here.  I'm not going to say anything.  But you are taking this to a very extreme level.  And it doesn't look like it's going to end well.  I'll just say that.  Well, it is called Breaking Bad.  Yeah, yeah.  Not Breaking Good.  No, not Breaking Good.  I mean, it is going dark.  You know, from the beginning, we knew that it was going to go this way.  Because our creator, Vince Gilligan and the Lord Jesus Christ said that he wanted to take 
[00:04:30]  a guy who was a really nice guy, a good guy, and take him from Mr. Chips to Scarface.  So we knew the trajectory.  I just didn't know how deep and dark it would actually go for this guy.  Yeah, just a complete disregard for anyone else but you and apparently your immediate family.  But even your wife on the show is starting to look at you like, this is a monster. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  And she doesn't even know the half of it.  I know, she doesn't.  It gets really bad.  She doesn't need to know.  Who's going to tell her?  You're going to tell her?  I'm not saying a word.  You go about your business, Mr. Science Teacher.  The thing that's so interesting about this is that I think, certainly men, but any human  being is capable of getting this dark, given the right set of circumstances.  I'm telling you, I think it's possible. 
[00:05:30]  What's happened to Walter White is that he's been seduced.  Never before in his adult life has he had money, has he been able to intimidate any other  man ever.  Just a mild-mannered science teacher.  He was invisible to everybody, even himself.  And all of a sudden, through these set of circumstances, he finds himself.  He finds his power.  And yeah, he's preening now.  He's a peacock.  But it's better than feeling numb.  You know, so if you told him you could have an extraordinary two years to live, or the 
[00:06:00]  absolute most boring 20 years to live, what would you do?  And it's like, I'm not so sure.  There's a lot of desperation and depression involved in, you know, that kind of desperate  life.  Yeah.  The transformation has been done so well that it's believable.  That's the amazing part.  Over the course of all the seasons, you have gone from just the invisible science teacher  to a drug kingpin, for the most part. 
[00:06:30]  And the whole transformation's been very realistic.  Because it didn't, there wasn't any one moment that kind of made it happen.  It's just all these things came together over time.  I think that's what Breaking Bad does well, is that he uses the medium the way it should.  It's like your show.  You use the medium the way it should.  Look at us, see?  You do.  You use the medium the way it should.  It's immediate.  It's current.  It's funny. 
[00:07:00]  It moves quickly.  Yeah.  Um, Breaking Bad would not make a good movie, because there are too many elements that would  have been necessary to cut out in order to make it an hour and a half to two hours.  And you'd look at it and say, how did this guy become this?  He was just...  Yeah, it's too truncated.  There's too many leaps.  So, serialized television slowly played out, agonizingly played out sometimes.  It's the best way.  You definitely saw the direction you wanted to go in, but it took these things, these 
[00:07:30]  hurdles you had to go over, and awful things you had to do, to learn how to be that evil.  It's an amazing transformation.  Yeah.  Very cool.  It's really a sociological experiment to me.  I don't want to give any spoilers or anything.  I've got to ask you, at the beginning, very beginning of the first episode of Season 5,  we do see a different look on you, a different look when you're near the trunk.  Yes, you do. 
[00:08:00]  Was that a flash...  You're being so good, by the way.  I'm trying.  Was that a flash forward?  It is a flash forward.  Okay.  You're looking at a flash forward.  So, we'll get a little resolution of that?  Well, no.  You know what's funny is that the teaser of the first episode is revealing in so many  ways.  Yes.  And yet, not.  And you don't get anything.  You don't get...  It's like, what, what, what?  And then you realize, what did I just see?  I don't know.  That's what I was doing.  I was literally craning my neck, looking up, going, what's in there? 
[00:08:30]  What is...  Like, thinking I'd see something different if I looked the other way.  Yeah.  Just, it's been such a compelling show.  The suspense is great.  The second episode of this season was edge of your seat.  The entire time is edge of your seat.  Mike, the character Mike in there, the fact, what he wants to do and what he has to do,  the difference in that is you start feeling bad for him. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  And he's a son of a bitch.  It's amazing how this show toys with your sympathies.  Yes.  Where you have these people doing awful things, and yet you're sympathizing and almost rooting  for them.  Come on, make that crystal meth.  Yeah.  Come on.  Bring back the old team.  Let's get the band back together.  Kind of a feel to it.  Exactly.  It really is.  There's a lot of housewives saying, oh, maybe if we just warn him with a, you know, shooting  his kneecap as opposed to killing him. 
[00:09:30]  I think that, you know, I don't think we have to kill everyone.  That just goes to show how well the writing is.  It's really brilliant.  Because you do.  How do you get somebody that's so awful of a person and make him sympathetic?  What was so interesting about Vince Gilligan's jump into this is that historically, television  has always been about staying the same.  Every single character that you know and love in the past, you could turn on the television.  There he is.  There's my guy.  My pal.  He's always the same. 
[00:10:00]  I can depend on him.  And this show has always been about change.  How can we change?  And just when he comes to a certain point, change him again.  Get him darker.  Get him moving.  And then what about my wife, who is, oh, she's a loving, caring, oh, wait a minute.  Maybe she's changing, too.  She's got a little in her, yeah.  Everybody's changing.  Yeah, she's got a little bit of evil in her, too.  But I think it's almost like she didn't realize how bad this was going to get and how far you 
[00:10:30]  drag your family into all this.  And what is the, initially, I guess the motivation was dying of cancer, have to take care of the  family.  So it was a noble effort when you started.  But how did it get so evil?  What is it in the character?  Is it the fact that the character just didn't want to be bored for the rest of his life?  Well, if you've, you know, it's been a hypothetical we've all played.  If you had a year to live, how would you live your life? 
[00:11:00]  And this poor bastard's thinking, I'm just going to wither away and my wife's going to  empty my bedpan and we'll blow through whatever little savings we have.  And that's the legacy I'm leaving.  No man wants to.  You want to have some control.  So for the first time in his life, he makes a bold move and says, by God, I'm going to  do this thing because I know how.  The one thing I don't know is what to do with it.  I don't know how to sell it.  So that's why he needs Aaron Paul's character, Jesse, in order to come in to distribute the 
[00:11:30]  thing.  Simple plan, make a bunch of money, give it to my family, die.  There it is.  It doesn't.  But he realizes once you sell your morality for cash, you're lost.  There's no line that you can stop at.  When you try to become someone you're not, you're lost.  So you paint like a real picture of this guy.  Like as an actor, do you, how much of that do you do beforehand?  Well, how much of it do you do just from the script?  Or do you actually, will you go home and think like, who is this person? 
[00:12:00]  Or how do you see it when you play somebody like this?  Not anymore.  When you first start to put a character together, you ask that question a lot.  Where is he from?  In fact, most actors, including myself, will do what's called a backstory.  You'll write your own backstory, his education, where he was raised, teachers, things like  that.  That just helps fill in the blanks for you.  And some of it may come to fruition.  Some of it may never be known except to you.  But you start doing that so you have more anchor points. 
[00:12:30]  The more that an actor knows about a character, it gets inside of him or her, and you feel  more comfortable in how you portray it.  After a certain point, I don't have to think about it anymore.  I just live it.  I slip into his wallabies, put on the glasses and the chinos, and I go, there you are.  How much different of a guy is he from you?  I mean, not the behavior, but I mean as a guy.  He's killed more people than I have.  No, but I mean like...  I've killed people. 
[00:13:00]  I don't want to paint the wrong picture.  I don't mean his actions.  I mean as a person.  Because this is a regular person pushed into extraordinary circumstances, so that's kind  of what you base it on is being a real person.  He's not anything like me.  No.  No, no, he's very, very smart, so there's the big comparison there.  He's been put in a position where he has not expressed himself as a man, as an adult.  He's never taken chances. 
[00:13:30]  My whole career, being an actor and being in the arts, you're taking chances constantly,  and you have to get comfortable with that.  He's introverted, or at the start he was.  He was shy, he was milquetoast, and so I had to get into that mindset of what makes  him be him, what makes a person, what makes a man cave in like that and become depressed,  and I came up that he developed a fear of failure, and that he had missed opportunities  in his life, and that led to his depression, and that led to this kind of invisible man concept 
[00:14:00]  that I wanted to bring forward.  And so when we were designing the face and the hair, I took all the color out of my hair  when we first started.  I had this little impotent mustache, a mustache that you can see through and was light because  we lightened it and thinned it out.  And you'd never, if you want to make an impotent mustache, you guys, I know, you'd want this. 
[00:14:30]  You'd never have the hair turn down the corners of the mouth, because then it gets macho when  you get down there.  So I used to cut it here, I thin it out.  I wanted a mustache for people to look at and go, what's the point?  What are you trying to say?  We've all seen those.  It's like, wow.  We looked at people in the process.  Really?  So you groomed that.  It's like, what are you?  An impotent mustache.  An impotent mustache.  That's classic.  So I wanted him to disappear. 
[00:15:00]  So all his clothes were taupes and sand color and off-whites and things.  I wanted him to blend into the walls.  I wanted him to feel invisible.  And so on those first episodes, when I'm in the classroom and trying to look at anybody  who might be interested in chemistry and getting nothing, it helped me as a character realize  I'm so depressed.  How did I get here?  I'm looking at it.  Nobody cares that I'm even here. 
[00:15:30]  Nobody knows I'm even here.  If I walked out of this classroom, they wouldn't even know they're going to continue texting  and whatever.  I've lost.  And that was part of what made you do what you ended up doing on the show.  I guess if you were a successful, or if the character was a successful teacher that was  beloved by the students, even if you got the cancer and needed to get money for the  family, it probably wouldn't have worked out the same way.  It was just a combination of everything. 
[00:16:00]  It had everything to do with it.  All the features were there.  All those elements came into play.  But one thing confusing, though, you did it initially for your family and out of love  for your family and concern about their future.  And then it seems like you lost the concern for your family because you pretty much put  them in danger now with what you're doing.  What are you saying?  How did that change?  You got a problem with that?  Not at all.  I think it's great.  All for one.  All for me.  But what happened with the character that he kind of, not wrote off his family, but 
[00:16:30]  didn't seem that concerned?  Walter White was seduced.  He was seduced by power, by money, all the things that he never had before.  Even at the cost of his family.  Well, he didn't realize.  I mean, we've all met very bright people who, in social situations, they go, oh my God,  this guy's a PhD and he's like unbelievably bright and yet he can't hold a conversation 
[00:17:00]  in a social environment or whatever.  So it doesn't mean if you're good at one thing, you're good at another.  And so here you have a man who is very smart, but he made some poor choices and he actually  thinks that this simple plan will work, but he doesn't have the skill set to be a mastermind  criminal, at least back then he didn't.  And he's learning quickly.  Yeah, yeah.  Is there anything hard for you, as an actor, is there anything that's hard for you to play?  Like when they ask you to do one, like is there a behavior or an emotion that's easier 
[00:17:30]  for you or more comfortable for you?  And then there's one that when you do it, you're like, all right, this one's more work.  Any, you know, any given emotion, I don't know.  Yeah, if you're asked to play some fast-talking kind of guy who is authority on something,  you have a lot of research to do because you have to really delve into that and know what  you're talking about because it's coming out of your mouth so much faster than you ever 
[00:18:00]  thought.  My guy on Drive, that movie Drive, was kind of that way where he talked too much.  He spoke too much.  So I had to just get back into the garage and, you know, just get my head into that, you  know, that grease monkey kind of mentality and pick up a wrench and figure out things  and, you know, because I, you know, I ad-libbed a lot in that film and it was a lot about cars  and things like that.  Yeah.  Do you give yourself something to do?  Like a lot of great actors will do that. 
[00:18:30]  Like they'll always be doing something like normal, like whether it's, you know, eating  or just doing something like, you know, Pacino with his hands.  The people, like there's these little weird things that actors do that I think is so interesting  just to feel like it's real life.  It gives, it gives actors a handle, something to hold on to.  If you're just standing there, it, it doesn't always feel the most comfortable.  So if you're actually doing something and, you know, peeling a potato or something, anything,  it, it basically makes the actor a little distracted in an activity, which, uh, which is a good 
[00:19:00]  thing.  See, I never know.  It's a running joke on this show, but I don't, when I'm just standing there, like if I, if  they said in every scene, like that I've ever, like, we need to just dump salt on something.  Like if there was slugs in every scene, I'd be fucking amazing.  But when you just have to stand there, like walk into a room and make a proclamation, I just,  I stiff it up and I literally don't, I watch hands so much when people act because  it's so hard to be natural and conversational.  Like right now my hands are just dead. 
[00:19:30]  You don't think about it when you're talking to someone on the street, your hands are doing  what they do.  But if you were, uh, told to speak to a person on camera, now you're conscious of everything.  Like if we were holding this conversation, if I had written this conversation out and  we were having it, you'd be sitting there as natural as you are.  And my hands, I'd be like, I'd, I'd be raising them.  I'd be fucking poking things.  And then they'll tell you, no, you're, you're moving your hands a lot.  Let's do another take, everybody.  And just keep your hands to your side.  Now you're thinking, get my hands to my side.  I've been moving my hands.  Exactly.  And now they're like frozen down. 
[00:20:00]  Jim, Jim, this is, whose life is it anyway?  You can't be moving your hands around a lot.  It's almost too hard to lead you.  Remember Jim, you're paralyzed from the neck down.  So the movement thing is a little bit of a problem.  I'm always interested in how guys do that.  Maybe they just don't, maybe you're just so good you don't think about it anymore.  But I'm fascinated by how you can make that so fucking natural.  It's so hard to do, man.  It does look hard.  Well, it's supposed to look hard and look easy.  But it is actually very difficult to do. 
[00:20:30]  Are you comfortable around guns?  You do a lot of gunplay in the show.  Well, my character is not.  Yes.  You know, he doesn't know from that world.  So, no, he's not too comfortable.  When I was a kid, I used to shoot rifles.  Yeah.  And doing some competitive shooting.  And that was fun.  I enjoyed that.  Yeah, yeah.  So I know my way around it.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I guess you're more apt to poison somebody or something.  A little more science. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah, drink it.  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  Did he touch my coffee?  Yeah, that was...  I love the idea of incorporating science in killing people.  Yeah.  There's more of that coming up this year.  I don't doubt it.  It does work well.  Well, and your loyalty to Jesse, it seems like it's there in the criminal element of what  you want to do.  But as a person or friend, you have really no respect or like for this guy. 
[00:21:30]  Well, you know, I don't know.  And I think he idolizes you.  He still calls you Mr. White, which is very odd to watch.  Very sign of respect.  I think it's more a sign of him kind of still being a child in the classroom and calling  you Mr. White.  But yeah, you personally, on a personal level, you've done horrible things to this guy.  Well, I don't know.  I mean, if he ever finds out what I've done, I mean...  Yes, there will be hell to pay.  We'd be in trouble, yeah. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  But he's a great, great actor.  Yeah, yeah.  And he's fun to work with.  He's supposed to be here, right?  I was going to say, great actor, not very prompt.  Yeah, he's not very punctual.  He doesn't own a watch.  He has no clue what time it is at any given moment.  Yeah, they said he was in traffic.  He's stuck in traffic.  Yeah.  But yeah, it just does seem like you've put everything aside, even that.  And that's a very threatening place to put yourself, because you know he would do awful  things if he found out what you've done.  Yeah.  Yeah, and you know, as we wind down for season, season five, season six, we'll start for eight 
[00:22:30]  episodes, and then we're done for good.  See, I did not know that.  Yes.  Yeah.  And that's going to be it?  Okay.  And that'll be it.  Wow.  That'll be it.  I need more seasons.  Are you okay with that?  I'm okay with that, yeah.  I mean, it will have...  I think it's time?  Yeah.  I mean, given the story that this man had two years to live, and he's still going to die  of lung cancer, if not of something else beforehand, but yeah, I want to stay true to what we told  the audience, and be fair with that. 
[00:23:00]  You don't want to do like MASH, where the Korean War's 11 years?  11 years on it.  I thought this was supposed to only be three years, and I was like, the Beatles are playing  at the Korean War's game on it.  And he's like, really?  Was it 11 years?  Yeah, I guess it was.  Yeah, it's time to move on.  It's time to move on.  Close it down.  Do you remember, here's an odd question, do you remember the last time that you were lousy?  Like something you did years ago, that you're like, oh, God, was I awful enough?  I wasn't too kind to my wife the other day.  No, I mean, I was an actor. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, I know.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, sure.  In fact, friends of mine have a humiliation night, where they ask you to bring, they ask  actors and performers to bring your worst shit over.  Wow.  Do you know how easy it is to be me and bring everything?  No, and see, that's it.  You have to cull through that and say, this is the worst I've ever been.  What a great idea it is.  And you drink.  You're drinking all night long, and you're laughing at everyone else's horrible performances. 
[00:24:00]  It's great.  You're just ripping each other completely.  We've had some of the stand-ups come in, and we've played some of their early material,  and some of their videos, and we've actually, yeah, we've played shit that we've done on  the air.  It's humiliating.  When we were first on the radio, just happy to be there.  Oh, that's right.  Five minutes after the big hour, five o'clock here.  Just embarrassing.  But that's got to be pretty nerve-wracking, just sitting there with your friends goofing 
[00:24:30]  on your work.  The last time we did it was with Seth MacFarlane.  He was over, and we were drinking, and he did an on-camera thing on Star Trek, the TV  series.  And he was really stiff and in the background.  You know, he was doing it and marching.  It looked like he had something stuck up his ass.  It was funny.  So funny.  It is embarrassing to watch, so even though you're getting laughs from your friends, it  really is on some level, like, oh, God, is that rough?  What did you bring? 
[00:25:00]  I brought this thing called Crisis Counselor, which was a really bad, one of the early reality  shows back in, like, 1980, I want to say.  And it was kind of an improv show dealing with therapy sessions, group therapy sessions.  And they would only tell you basically what you are, and then everything else just comes  out.  And I played this guy who was married, and his wife is pregnant, and he has a male lover 
[00:25:30]  on the side.  And I was told, you need to make this right on the show.  You just need to say, what's wrong with this?  And I went, really?  And so my arguments were, like, I don't know, I just, you know, she was a little sick, so  I thought I'd step away, have myself a lover.  Were you playing it up like that?  Not unlike any other guy would do. 
[00:26:00]  Go get yourself a male lover, you know, when your wife is pregnant, right?  And it's like, they're looking at me like, what?  You're such an ass.  And so everybody else on the panel was, you know, throwing daggers at me, and I'm trying  to, this weak argument.  Anyway, we had a blast.  They were, and it carved me up quite a bit on that one.  You know how, I guess back then you'd never thought this would end up for public consumption,  but all this stuff can be found on YouTube. 
[00:26:30]  Everything's available.  And back then it was like, all right, that's gone forever.  There's no way it'll come back.  It's never going to see the light of day.  It'll never surface.  And here you go.  There it is.  Yeah, that's, yep.  They're telling us you have to leave.  They're telling us that you have to.  Great show.  Yeah.  Great, tremendous actor.  I love it.  If you have not seen it, you have like maybe, what, the weekend to do a big, long marathon?  Four seasons.  Catch up.  I would do it.  I'd run two TVs at once and do two episodes at the same time. 
[00:27:00]  It's fantastic.  And like I said when you were here last time, the first episode of the first season grabs  you.  Yeah.  The only comparison I have really is the lost pilot was like that when all of a sudden  there's a plane crash.  People walk around and they're like, what is going on here?  Yeah.  And you have to stick around for it.  And that's exactly what Breaking Bad is.  Fantastic show.  Huge fan, Brian.  Appreciate it.  Thanks, guys.  Love it.  All right.  You're listening to the worst of the Opie and Anthony show, Sirius XM. 
[00:27:30]  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  My name is E-Rock.  We're looking back at the summer of 2012.  Everything that happened from Memorial Day to Labor Day is going to be played.  Well, not everything because we only have five hours, but some of the best stuff that  was going on this summer will be played for you here in this segment.  It features Opie.  It's actually two segments mixed into one.  And back in the day when Opie was an upcoming rock DJ, he hung some lyrics up on his wall  from a song that meant a whole lot to him. 
[00:28:00]  As he likes to say, listen to the words, man.  Well, he decided to hang these up for you to read.  And it turns out to be one of the douchiest songs of all time.  Right after that, this is another famous bit when we had Ice-T on the show.  He just happened to be at Sirius XM.  He wasn't booked.  We saw him in the hallway.  He said, come on in.  So he came in, and right as he walked in, Opie called him by the wrong name.  So first you have Opie hangs lyrics on his wall, followed by Opie and Ice-T, and they  both start right now.  Well, one after the other. 
[00:28:30]  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  I have another one, and I don't know if I've ever brought this up in here.  Oh, shit.  I'm not really sure.  It's time now.  You should.  I am here like a kibber winger.  Thank you.  If this goes bad, I'll be honest with you, I'm going to attack Iraq.  Okay, great.  Is that fair?  All right.  It's always a fair game.  Is that fair?  Or E. Ross?  Is that fair?  Win, win.  I'm going to use him as a punching bag if this goes badly.  It's a big punching bag.  I can't do this one.  Why? 
[00:29:00]  I don't know.  Maybe we should take a break because it could be an hour.  Come on.  No, I can't do it.  What song is it?  I even wrote down the lyrics.  Ooh, that's douchey.  I wrote them down and they were hanging up in my dorm room and my roommate ripped them  down.  While he was...  Ew, you're humming the lyrics in a college dorm?  Yeah.  I was 18, though.  Fuck, girls.  I was 18 and very immature.  I wasn't ready for college.  So if a girl came back to your room, you would explain to her? 
[00:29:30]  No, it was about a girl.  Read the word.  Oh, no, no.  It was a song that talked to me and it's what I was feeling with this relationship.  I can't do this.  Oh, what a lonely boy.  Oh, what a lonely...  No, I was actually feeling that maybe love thing for the first time.  Was the girl feeling the same way?  Oh, yeah.  At the time.  I was hoping no.  So you wrote the lyrics down about her and put them on the wall.  Oh, my roommate who just ripped them down.  Was it girl?  Look what you've done to me. 
[00:30:00]  It's a New Wave song.  It's a New Wave genre.  People are guessing.  Peter Cetera, Gloria Love.  Wow, no.  She blinded me with science?  It's more in that genre of New Wave, yeah.  Not the Karate Kid 2 song from Chicago.  Oh, boy.  Ooh.  What's on the top ten list on MTV?  It doesn't matter.  Yeah, that song.  I'll be a man.  I'll fight for your honor.  Is that it?  No.  I can't do this, man.  I actually stopped breathing. 
[00:30:30]  What is it?  Open Arms?  Open Arms?  That's a good song.  Open Arms.  This is.  It's up there.  Open Arms?  Open Arms is up there when you're feeling that love for the first time.  I'm good.  No?  Nope.  Is it Africa by Toto?  It's more New Wave.  Open Arms is journey.  I don't know who's New Wave, though.  What's New Wave considered?  New Wave pop.  New Wave is like early 80s.  I would walk 5,000 miles.  New Wave is any singer that sounds like this.  Yes, sir. 
[00:31:00]  I'm New Wave pop.  And then your stupid keyboard's got to move around a lot.  Yes.  Keyboards.  He plays the synthesizer.  What's on the top ten list?  We can move on.  It doesn't matter.  Hold on.  Wait.  Was it not?  It's brutal.  It's not?  I might want to save this when there's more guys in it, so my beating is really good.  Fishman's got it.  What?  Come on and rock me.  I'm a deus.  I'm a deus.  I'm a deus.  I'm a deus.  I'm a deus.  Wait.  What was the fucking one?  God.  Not Thomas.  Not.  Fuck me. 
[00:31:30]  I'm a deus.  Wait.  What did you just say there?  Not Thomas Dolby.  Thomas Dolby.  No.  No.  It couldn't have been Thomas Dolby.  That's the Thompson Twins?  What?  The Thompson Twins?  Oh, no.  What?  Oh, no.  No, no, no.  Is it?  Hold me now?  No.  No, it couldn't be.  Hold me now.  I'm going to turn B red today.  I rarely do this.  It was, it was, yeah.  It was hold me now, Thompson.  Dude, how did you get that?  How did you figure that out? 
[00:32:00]  Because his reaction when I said Tom, and I'm like, what else was Tom?  So I just went to Thompson Twins.  Then Tom hates this song.  This is what I thought.  This song.  No, I thought it was Tom.  This song.  Tom hates it.  You wrote these lyrics out?  This song.  This?  I'm so embarrassed.  Why?  You wrote the words out?  Ew.  He wrote hold me now.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Bring them up, Sam.  Hold on.  Claws is for me.  I have a picture.  Before I bite your fat neck.  Sorry.  I can't be taking clothes and I bite you.  Oh, my God.  This spoke to me.  My first, like, real relationship when I was, like, 18 in college. 
[00:32:30]  I have a picture.  I have a picture.  Oh, my God.  Pinned to my wall.  Pinned to my wall.  I got to shut down my Twitter.  I'm going to the country club and caddying.  I hope he doesn't lose his ball.  Yes.  I have a hole.  I'll drill in the wall.  On my chin is a pair of balls. 
[00:33:00]  All right.  We're pouring cement in our backyard.  We're ditching our car and taking Fresca because he's dead.  You're a Fresca.  Oh, poor Fresca.  Road sodas now.  Road sodas now.  Oh, it's the douchiest thing.  Hold on.  I'm sorry.  Here, I'll pause this for one second.  The doors wouldn't shut, so we strung a cable that would have cut us in half. 
[00:33:30]  Oh, stare at me while I sleep.  Oh, the Negro stare at me while I sleep.  Oh, wow.  Very good.  Good call back.  The day I was supposed to be raped in Buffalo.  Yes.  Wow.  That is a true story, man.  That is an image.  I was supposed to be raped in Buffalo.  People don't understand that, do they?  Wow.  I have a picture pinned to my wall.  I want to know which one.  An image of you and me, and we're laughing and loving it all. 
[00:34:00]  So you kind of had an image of you two just frolicking?  Well, I probably, because this is a long time ago now, probably actually had those pictures,  yes.  Oh, oh.  Look at our life now, tattered and torn.  See, that didn't make sense.  Why?  Sure, it did, because you were both torched souls.  Your eyes were tattered.  I know why.  I spelled it with one T in the middle because you were young.  Does it look like tattered?  Does it look like Ron White's act?  Tattered and torn. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, no.  He rocked his pace and back and forth.  I'm ready to go, Ian.  Oh, Jesus.  Get ready for a couple punches.  We fuss and we fight.  Wait, the tattered and torn, I will break this down for you.  It was a long distance relationship.  So there's the tattered and torn.  I'm a kid, and I'm like, how the fuck am I going to make this work?  That's tattered and torn.  You live there.  I live over here.  You're right.  And you live over there.  I'm over here now, tattered and torn.  So that was the tattered and torn, and that's what spoke to me like, oh, fuck, how are we going  to make this work, man?  Oh, I don't even have a job.  But we fuss and fight. 
[00:35:00]  And I've got to get back to Long Island to do some of that caddying.  Yeah, come on.  We fuss and fight and delight in the tears that we cry until dawn.  Oh, there you go.  You hung this up.  Transcribed it.  Look, I didn't want to do this.  I know.  I've been here before.  Whenever you've got to go, look.  I didn't want to do this.  Oh, no.  I was going to hold back this information.  Yes, I did hang this up.  Fortunately, you didn't.  Hold me now.  Hold me now.  I warm my heart.  Because you had kind of a cold heart.  No one understood you. 
[00:35:30]  A girl could warm your heart.  Yeah, this one could.  We can all understand that, right?  This girl could.  Right, guys?  We can understand that part of this, right?  We're all in the same boat here, right?  Right?  Stay with me.  Let loving start.  Yeah, see?  Aw.  Nice, right?  Let loving start.  But would she really say you were a dreamer?  Say you were a dreamer.  You would say something and she'd say, oh, but you're a dreamer.  I had dreams of doing radio back then, yes.  With two of a kind.  I was dreaming for something better for myself. 
[00:36:00]  So she was a dreamer, too, because you're two of a kind.  Yep.  You were dreaming about doing radio and she was dreaming about somebody who didn't hang  lyrics in a college dorm.  We were going to do this together, man.  Both of us searching for some perfect world we know we'll never find.  Oh, boy.  That's like a premonition of Sirius XM satellite radio.  Perfect world we know we'll never find because it's just there.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  Where's that dick? 
[00:36:30]  So perhaps.  You can't do that bit.  We're going to Chicago, but you can't do anything.  Oh, shit.  I'm shutting down my Twitter for 12 hours.  Oh, shit.  So these people can't get to me.  Sorry.  Keep up your good nature.  12 hours.  I'm going dark.  So perhaps I should leave here.  Yeah, yeah.  Go far away.  Go far away.  He left Long Island and went to college. 
[00:37:00]  That's how you get your dreams done.  You got to move away from home.  Don't these people understand this by now?  They should.  Nothing happens in your hometown.  Wake the fuck up.  Get out of there.  Leave.  But you know that there's nowhere that I'd rather be than with you here today.  Did she know you fucking felt this way?  That's kind of true, actually.  Did she know that you felt this way?  Oh, yeah.  And you told her about this song and said, baby, this song is about us, man.  It's our song.  And she'd be talking while it was on and you'd go, this part. 
[00:37:30]  This part.  I stopped breathing again.  So wait.  Now, would you rewrite?  I've got to remind myself to breathe.  What?  Would you write, hold me now, warm my heart, stay with me, let loving start?  Would you actually put the parentheses that says, let loving start?  Which implies.  Let loving start.  I wrote it as is, man.  Oh, yeah.  You ask if I love you.  Well, what can I say?  What can you say?  You know that I do and that this is just one of those games that we play. 
[00:38:00]  So you two would probably quarrel.  Ah, the games.  No, it's very literal.  They played Monopoly.  It's just one of the games.  They played Doctor because she was six and he was 18.  Oh, kick your legs now.  Oh, God.  Why is Iran picking his nose?  Oh, Iran.  Don't pick your nose in there.  It's disgusting.  Oh, Iran.  You probably had some food from last night.  Oh, no.  It's coming out his trunk.  Are we done?  Are we done?  It sprinkles up there.  So I'll sing you a new song. 
[00:38:30]  Are we done?  Oh, no.  Please don't cry anymore.  Oh, you're fucking helping her out.  Don't cry.  And then I'll ask your forgiveness.  Yeah.  Though I don't know just what I'm asking it for.  Yeah.  So that when you two would fight, you'd be asking for her to, hey, let's straighten this out.  You don't know.  You just want to get it better.  You just want to get to that better place.  You wanted the hurting to stop.  Right.  Exactly.  Let's move on.  Well, you want to let loving start.  Let's move on.  You want to let loving start.  No, I mean, let's move on from that.  Let loving start.  Right.  Emotion.  Oh, oh, hold me now.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  I'm sorry. 
[00:39:00]  We heard the song.  Wait, are you done with the lyrics?  This is the lyrics.  This is the lyrics.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, good.  You want to know.  You wrote them out.  They're beautiful.  This is a short, beautiful poem.  There it is.  I was as lame as they call them when I was 18.  I would think you were lame if you just enjoyed this once on the radio.  If you said I heard this once and didn't turn it off, I'd be like, what a douche.  I was extremely innocent before life fucking beat the shit out of me.  I'm not innocent anymore, motherfuckers.  Is that believable? 
[00:39:30]  This second verse.  This is your verse.  Search of the sober world that we know we'll never find.  So perhaps I should leave here.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Go far away.  It's Geneseo.  But you know that there's nowhere that I'd rather be than with you here today.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  So to the hold of wall.  Hold me now. 
[00:40:00]  Hold in wall.  Oh, hold in wall.  That was a cock singing to him, hold me now.  Why am I the only one?  Where's your song, motherfuckers?  Talk about my song.  I confess going to a tranny bar and losing my wallet.  This is fair game.  You're kidding.  Yeah, this is the O.P.D. Anthony Show.  If you like me, you will not replay the Ice Cube Ice Tea thing.  Just want to say.  You know what?  I may have to reestablish our relationship today then.  Because some things are simply more important. 
[00:40:30]  You made me feel...  What I learned...  Hold on.  All I ask is you make the people realize that I came back strong from that faux pas.  Listen.  I came back strong.  The last hour of the show, you performed very strongly.  I didn't say anything to Mickey Ward.  You didn't say one word to him?  I don't think so.  No, yes, you did.  You brought up the Brian Gumbel thing.  Which was different.  That was a little something.  That was a little Opie Spice added to the interview.  But...  What you did do... 
[00:41:00]  Who's all that talking out there?  Huh?  Who's all those people talking?  That's the ballsack kid.  You're not invited.  It's a nice little fun gathering.  Well, I can't go.  Could you at least invite me and I'll say...  Danny's invited.  You're not invited.  We're having fun out here.  I heard somebody say Adam Walsh, so I think I know what they're talking about.  I can't wait to hear it again.  He's Anthony.  That was Anthony.  I heard Anthony's voice.  These fuckers are talking about me and I'm not even there.  Well, guess what?  Guess who's one of them? 
[00:41:30]  I heard Anthony's voice.  That proves he was in here.  I heard your voice.  You said, I can't wait for...  You fuckers are talking about me and I'm not even there.  All right, look.  I'll say something.  Yes.  Since I just walked into the studio since you started the show.  For the first time?  First time.  I want to hear Ice Cube.  Well, I'll tell you what.  Find yourself a pair of headphones.  No, I can't do this.  Because we're having an Ice Cube party.  I'm sure we'll listen tomorrow morning.  I'm sure we will too.  But before we listen tomorrow morning, we'll listen this morning. 
[00:42:00]  I've wanted to hear this since you said it.  As Ice T...  I've got to get shoes for a wedding.  Come on.  As Ice T walked in the studio, Opie greeted him in his inimitable Opie fashion.  With a high and hearty Ice Cube.  If you have it for us.  Ice T is outside.  He wants to stop in, but do we have time?  Do we have Flippin' Flippin' Flippin'?  Ice Cube!  Holy shit!  I'll tell you why though!  I'll tell you why though!  How does it feel? 
[00:42:30]  I know how it feels.  How does it feel?  What no one picked up on is how I made it ghetto too.  I went Ice Cube!  Ice Cube!  Almost like an Ice Cube.  But that makes it worse.  I was going ghetto.  But you put something into it.  You were so confident that this was a person named Ice Cube coming in.  You're going to explain that to me like I don't know that?  Sam's going to explain to me what happened because I didn't realize that I gave it my all  because I really thought that was his name.  That's definitely Ice Cube.  No, I knew it was Ice T.  I knew he just said, oh, Ice T's making his way in here. 
[00:43:00]  And you go, Ice Cube!  But do we really listen to each other?  No.  No, that's true.  How does it feel?  How does it feel when it happens?  I might have to hear it one more time though.  One more time?  Ice T is outside.  He wants to stop in, but do we have time?  Do we have time?  Wait, wait, wait.  Can you pause this?  Hold on!  Oh, he paused it right a second after.  Come on.  But can we point out Overexcited Jimmy too?  Yeah, but Overexcited Jimmy was saying the correct name.  But he was getting into that address, address, address, that cadence. 
[00:43:30]  I don't know if you're going to make that hold up in this clip.  Fair enough.  Ice T is outside.  He wants to stop in, but do we have time?  Do we have time?  Do we have time?  Do we have time?  Do we have time?  Ice Cube!  Ice Cube!  I mean, Ice T!  Holy shit!  I'll tell you why!  I'll tell you why!  I'll tell you why!  I'll tell you why!  You were so confident.  Ice Cube!  Yeah, Ice Cube!  Yeah!  How does it feel?  It feels good, man.  It doesn't feel good.  I've been there.  It feels horrible.  E-Rock, do you have maybe another example of somebody doing something similar?  Yeah, see, I know how bad it feels.  Yes, there he is.  Okay. 
[00:44:00]  It's Jim.  I can hear his voice.  Adam Walsh!  Hi, John.  How are you?  What did I say?  Hi, John.  How are you?  Oh, my God.  I'm an idiot.  And we had the same...  Hi, John.  How are you, John?  Hi, John.  Hi, John.  John, John, John, John, John, John.  Jim goes into correction, and just like Opie did, I immediately was like...  Oh, no, I knew it the whole time.  I knew you were your dead, decapitated son.  Why can't we focus on Jimmy's...  He's a little excited there.  He's an excitable boy.  Because he always gets excited.  It's not every day that you call somebody...  I don't know.  Do we have time iced tea outside the studio? 
[00:44:30]  Do we have...  Just bring him in time.  It's not every day that you have a rapper come in, and you call them the name of a completely  different rapper.  Right.  Yeah, that was because we saw...  Whatever.  Fuck it.  I'll just go and look at my bank account.  I'll be fine.  Whoa!  Yeah, see, I can't do that.  Whoa!  I just had to go home and be humiliated and think to myself, I really am never going  to make it as a broadcaster.  You know, you're forcing me to buy fucking shoes for this wedding.  Yeah?  What do you mean?  These are my go-to sneakers I want to wear for everything.  Are you wearing a suit?  What do you mean, go-to sneakers? 
[00:45:00]  You don't wear sneakers to a wedding?  I know, so I have to wear fucking shoes, I just realized.  Yeah.  I don't have shoes.  Do you have shoes?  Yeah, I got all that shit.  Yeah, nice shoes.  Fucking suits, ties, all that shit.  Dress shoes.  How do you not have dress shoes?  Because I don't wear suits.  Well, you gotta wear a suit every so often.  And I throw the shoes away when I'm done.  Oh my God.  You throw the shoes away?  Yeah.  Like, didn't you have dress shoes when you did, like, the Tonight Show and Letterman and stuff  like that?  No, I think we went sneakers.  Sneakers?  Oh no, we had suits on.  Then I had shoes. 
[00:45:30]  I don't do the suit-sneaker thing.  And then you threw them out?  Like that asshole fucking from Ben Stein.  I don't do the fucking suit-sneaker combo bullshit.  Ben Stein.  And you throw out the shoes when you're done?  Yeah.  You've got lots of money.  Or give them away.  Why don't you just keep them and wear them next time?  I'm going to two other weddings in the month of June.  Wow.  You're way worse than me.  What do you mean?  I dressed apart when I got married.  How about you dressed apart?  I am.  I'm getting a nice suit. 
[00:46:00]  I got a very nice suit.  What about tux?  No, I'm getting a black suit.  You can't wear the suit from your own wedding for other people's weddings.  You change the shirt and the tie.  It's a different suit.  Yeah.  I don't know about that.  You know?  Is it like, you look like men in black?  Black suit?  What are you doing?  No, I, well, it's, yeah, I got my groomsmen wearing that.  And then I'm going to wear more of a, you know, kind of grayish tie and I'll have a vest.  You should have a white tuxedo with tails and a top hat.  Like big?  Yeah.  Like Tom Hanks when he comes down the stairs. 
[00:46:30]  Because you're just a kid at heart.  With the gold trim and everything?  Yes.  Eating those mini corns like you're not supposed to?  You can eat the cob on those things.  I know.  It's crazy.  I'm planning a prank for your wedding.  Why?  I just want to let you know that.  Why would you plan a prank?  Because it'll be fun.  Salt Peter and his food so he can't get a boner?  Yeah.  That'd be good.  It'll be fun for everyone.  It's like Troy who wants to wear something outlandish to the wedding.  I'm going to Spencer's Gifts.  Oh, no.  Don't go there.  Or is it Spencer Gifts?  Spencer Gifts.  That's the prank capital of them all.  They got all the good jokes there.  Are you going to get a game we can all play? 
[00:47:00]  Pass out?  I'm going to bring a prank to your wedding.  I might go with pepper gum.  I'm not sure yet.  Ah.  But I'm going to think you're handing me a can of salted nuts for me to enjoy and a  spring is going to pop out.  Yeah.  And one of those snake cans.  Yeah.  Whoa.  Whoa.  You get all scared.  I don't need a scare like this on my wedding day.  I'm bringing pranks to your wedding.  You are?  Mm-hmm.  Hey, didn't Opie have a moment on the show today?  No.  If we could play that real quick.  Ice-C is outside.  He wants to stop him.  But do we have time?  Or do we have Flippin' Rippin'? 
[00:47:30]  Ice Cube!  I mean, Ice-C is, dude.  Holy shit!  Ice Cube!  Ice Cube!  Ice Cube!  Ice Cube!  Ice Cube!  Ice Cube!  Ice Cube!  Ice Cube!  Ice Cube!  Ice Cube!  Ice Cube!  That is so funny.  The look he gave me, too.  Ice Cube!  Ice Cube!  Ice Cube!  Ice Cube!  Ice Cube!  Oh, we all heard it and froze.  I froze like, oh my god, he didn't just call him Ice Cube.  And, of course, Kevin from Connecticut is chiming in with things like, I love the ice  coffee interview.  I love the ice pick interview.  Ice pick's very good.  Well, Kevin's a little needy.  Let's be honest with each other.  He is.  Enough right, Kevin.  He comes out.  It's quality, not quantity sometimes.  But Jimmy, overexcited? 
[00:48:00]  Excitable boy?  He was pretty excited about that.  He loves his celebrity.  He loves his celebrity.  I don't know.  We have time?  Bring him in.  I don't know.  Wait, wait, wait.  I don't know.  We have time.  Ice-T.  Let's bring him in.  I acknowledge him.  Ice-T's coming in.  Ice-T.  A big mistake.  But Jimmy's excitable boy routine makes me howl every time.  How about the fact that Jim ruined the whole busting E-Rock for collecting Legos?  By just wanting Legos.  That pissed me off.  We had them.  We had E-Rock in our grips.  We had Fatso in our grips.  Hard to do. 
[00:48:30]  Well, one of us had one side and the other had the other side.  Yeah, that's the way it goes.  In our grips.  And then Jim starts obsessing over the Taj Mahal Lego set.  He wants it so bad.  Oh, by the way, I'm going to make believe that someone told me the rumor, and I'm going to  announce it tomorrow.  Why would you say you're still on the air?  I'm going to make believe.  So, E-Rock's not to run under the bus.  Eric, are you okay with that?  I'm going to make believe as I'm walking toward the elevator, someone came up to me and told  me the rumor so I can say it tomorrow on the show.  Oh, my God.  This is a big rumor. 
[00:49:00]  And then E-Rock will be off the hook.  It's the one we were alluding to this morning.  Maybe you should talk to the person who gave you the rumor and find out where he actually  got that from.  Because I just found out it wasn't what I told him.  Oh, my God.  Now it's getting...  Okay, now the Nagel vagaries are coming into play.  Wait, you're just on Nagel vagary.  This isn't the after-show Nagel I'm hearing either.  Wait, so this is still O&A show.  You guys are here.  So you guys aren't on the same page with the rumor?  Not until later, but he heard from the same source before. 
[00:49:30]  The rumor is the same from you and him.  Yes.  But he didn't hear it from me.  He was in the room when you told me.  But your source is good.  Yeah, but that was way after the fact.  He apparently knew before I didn't.  Colic butter source?  Colic butter source.  Jim, you didn't get a chance to hear Opie call Ice-T Ice Cube.  No, I would love to.  Oh, you would?  Got the headphones on, Jim.  Okay, yeah, throw those headphones on.  Thanks a lot, Sam.  You got it.  Ice-T is outside.  He wants to stop in, but do we have time or do we have Flippin' Rippin'?  Ice-Q! 
[00:50:00]  I mean, Ice-T!  Holy shit!  I'll tell you what it is!  I'll tell you what it is!  Ice-Q!  Ice-Q!  I like it.  It's like, Ice-Q!  The confidence!  Ice-Q!  Ice-Q!  That's always the worst.  It's the confidence.  The confidence is the worst part of that.  There's no doubt of who this man is.  It's Ice-Q!  That is Ice-Q!  Oh, God, no.  I know I'm failing miserably, but I love your excitable boy routine before that.  But, you know, my fucking mistake.  Yeah, and that clip.  My mistake is no one gives a fuck about the excitable boy routine. 
[00:50:30]  I don't know.  We have time?  Do we have time?  Let's bring it up.  Let's just bring it up.  If you had called him Ice-T, we absolutely could have pulled out that Norton clip.  Wait, was I excitable?  You're always excitable.  Listen to the...  Yeah, ignore the Ice-Q thing.  I'm a bit desperate here.  I get it.  But listen for Jimmy being an excitable boy.  Ice-T is outside.  He wants to stop him.  But do we have time?  Or do we have...  Flip it, flip it.  Ice-Q!  I mean, Ice-T is, too.  Holy shit!  I'll tell you what's going on!  See, in a split second, all of Jim's heat is taken completely away when you go... 
[00:51:00]  Ice-Q!  Ice-T is outside.  We got time?  Ice-T is?  Hub-bub-bub-bub.  And then you just go...  Hub-bub-bub-bub.  Yeah.  Hub-bub-bub-bub.  It's been hub-bub-bub-bub-bub.  Yeah.  Hey, Ice-T is outside.  Ice-T wants to get time to bring him in.  Let's bring him in for a second.  I know.  Let's hear it one more time.  And then you go...  And all I had to say was Ice-T, and I was...  But I was safe.  Listen to how the excitement goes away when Jim realizes what Obie's done, because he  goes, Ice-T.  Did I say that?  Yeah, listen.  All right, let's listen. 
[00:51:30]  Let me listen to that part now.  Ice-T is outside.  He wants to stop him.  But do we have time?  Do we have flip-flip-flip-flip-flip?  Ice-Q!  Ice-T!  I mean, Ice-T!  Holy shit!  There's so much going on!  Jimmy is so disappointed in me!  I couldn't believe it!  Jimmy is so disappointed in me!  Oh my god, the way he says it!  Ice-T!  What a dick!  Because it's mad at you!  Like, the way that clip sounds, it sounds like Jim was, like, looking at the door and  going, Ice-T, Ice-T, Ice-T! 
[00:52:00]  And then you went Ice-Cube, and he turned his entire chair around and leaves you with disgust.  Oh, please, please.  Play that again, please!  You're like a disappointed father.  He wants to stop him, but do we have time or we have flip-flip-flip-flip?  Ice-Q!  Ice-T!  I mean, Ice-T!  Holy shit!  You basically wanted to say, you idiot!  Disgusted Jim!  Oh, is that fucking great!  It's excitable!  Amazing!  It's excitable Jimmy, then there's my massive mistake, and then disappointed. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, yeah.  It's excitable Jimmy is followed by Opie's blunder, is followed by disgusted Jimmy.  Yeah, no, disappointed was more, I would say, excitable Jimmy, blithering Opie, disappointed  Jimmy.  I love the fucking...  I see his outside.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  The worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Sirius XM.  Worst of Opie and Anthony, my name is E-Rock, and we're looking back at the summer 
[00:53:00]  of 2012.  Everything that happened from Memorial Day to Labor Day, we're trying to find some of  the best stuff and play it for you here, because you're probably working, because if you're  on vacation, you're not listening to this shit.  In this segment, we had Dennis Leary in studio.  He's promoting whatever it is Dennis Leary does.  Oh, Spider-Man!  That's what he was in.  He's promoting Spider-Man, and he had a song out, so we would play that, and all of a sudden  Jim Brewer was in the building, and he just walked in and decided to join the conversation.  We talked to Brewer, Dennis Leary, all at once. 
[00:53:30]  Here it is.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Brewer, what the fuck?  You don't say I am!  Hi, Jim Brewer.  Are you doing this stuff?  How old are you doing?  45.  Fuck, man.  You're about a decade ahead of me.  Jesus Christ.  We're all old.  You used to be the really young guy.  He was the kid.  We're one of the really young guys, and now you're 45.  How many kids you got?  It's true.  How many kids you got?  Three girls.  Three girls.  Fuck.  This is 13.  I got a little kid hanging around the house now.  Oh, man.  I can't believe how old you are.  I'm not sure.  I do, but I can't say that because I don't know if my neighbors listen. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah, you can't do that.  I think the kid, I'm pretty sure that the kid helps my wife decorate.  Oh, shit.  Oh, yeah.  No, you're good.  You're good.  Yeah, no, I'm pretty confident.  That's a good problem to have.  He's like, Mr. Brewer, your new shades match your walls.  What 12-year-old child says that?  Knows that shit.  None.  None.  One that wants to fucking keep coming to the house without the father thinking anything.  He goes, I want to know I'm not overwhelming my stay. 
[00:54:30]  Am I still okay if I could use your pool?  I'm like, yeah, you can do it.  He wears a college shirt.  Wow.  I'm all right.  No, you're good.  You're good.  I think you're good.  I feel confident.  Yeah, no, you're all right.  She's 13 and she looks like what?  18?  She looks like she's 18.  Well, maybe he's really smart and maybe he's throwing the fucking sight game at you.  That's what I think.  Good one.  Hey, he's probably too smart, man.  He's pulling a bull rustle on him.  He may be doing that.  That could be. 
[00:55:00]  Imagine that.  He's like, hey, listen, I'm going to make your dad think I'm gay so he has no idea how deep  we're going in this relationship.  Oh, man.  Because even now, when he talks to her, he stands really close, but he frails with his  wrist, but he'll touch her arm and stuff.  But she doesn't give an ounce.  She doesn't give an ounce.  She doesn't give.  Have you spoken to her about how far the relationship is going?  Yes, she shuts it down instantly.  She's like, no.  Yeah.  No.  No.  She's clearly showed who she's liked. 
[00:55:30]  See, but she's a smart cat, too.  I don't know if she's playing with my emotions, either.  Look at you.  You've got to fucking try to figure out all this shit out.  You're going to start dressing like a transvestite just to keep boys away for the next eight  years.  I'd hang out with you more.  That's the only thing I'll keep treating you like, yeah, you would.  Yeah, you would.  Yeah, you would.  You may even be able to buy me.  Man, the fucking mind games that are going on.  You've got to figure out if they're bullshitting you about their sexuality.  I know how to change it.  I'll bring them to the movie.  Spider-Man, let them sit in the back. 
[00:56:00]  And then I'll see what's going on.  That's what the kids do now, too.  They sit in the back of the movie.  They want to get dropped off at the movie theater.  Oh, shit.  That's what goes on in my town.  I've got a lockdown in my town.  Dropped off at the movie theater.  They sit in the back.  And they pretend they're seeing the movie.  They wait until you turn the corner.  And they go, suck bass, and this and that.  This and that.  Yeah.  It's a nightmare.  I love that he's saying this like this is a brand new thing.  To me, it is.  This is what we used to do.  That is true.  I don't have a fingering girl during Friday the 13th for the original movie. 
[00:56:30]  During the Defiant one, some guy got blown.  That is Defiant.  It really is.  Oh, my God.  I wasn't in that world for years, though.  I was playing stickball until I was 15, 16.  It's like hockey.  No chicks, though?  Come on.  I would show off with a chicks, but I wasn't.  Yeah, you weren't.  It wasn't happening, right?  No.  That was all that it was.  With 13-year-olds.  That was all we wanted, though.  Yes.  Like my crowd of guys I hung out with. 
[00:57:00]  It was just.  That's all any of us wanted.  We just didn't get it.  And of course, you knew every girl wanted a fucking 69 Nova full of degenerates.  Right.  You got any friends?  Right.  It's the last thing they wanted.  69 Nova.  Now that's.  How much that car's worth now?  I know.  It's fucking crazy.  Not after I was done with it.  Jesus Christ.  The Plymouth Duster.  Remember those?  The Plymouth Duster.  That's another great one.  My brother had a Duster.  Let's go out in a Duster tonight.  Fucking A.  I had a Nova.  Chevy Nova.  73 Nova.  Hit the gas, faggot.  In the last three weeks.  What are you doing? 
[00:57:30]  Hit the gas.  Get big fucking cars in the back, faggot.  Get the J.C. Whitney catalog and fucking get some good shit for it.  Yeah, that thing loaded down in the back of, where was it?  Green Acres Mall.  It was the only white guy who ran for my life.  Green Acres Mall.  What the hell is that?  Long Island.  Valley Stream.  Oh, Jesus.  Valley Stream.  Oh.  Yeah.  South Shore trash.  I love it.  South Shore?  Why trash?  South Shore is trash.  We ruled the Long Island.  The fucking expressway is like the Mason Dixon line of fucking Long Island, man. 
[00:58:00]  It really was.  You stay over there, I'll stay over here.  You stay over here.  What would Carl think?  What?  What would Carl think?  Oh, Carl.  Wow.  I can't believe you brought Carl up.  My favorite.  My favorite person living or imagined.  I knew he would be.  It was Carl.  I don't remember Carl.  You guys just, he knows why he's coming down the street.  Hey, listen, the jungle's back the other way there.  You're out of your neighborhood.  There's no fruits in these trees, if you know what I'm saying. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, it was one of those neighborhoods.  Meanwhile, that was my dad.  I'm drinking the lawn.  Hey, the jungle's back that way, LeBron.  There's no one in the mug here.  We're all watching each other.  Head back to the...  Holy shit.  Hey, do you ever do more of your documentary?  You ever do more of that documentary?  No, but I think I'm going to...  You should, dude.  You should, man.  Well, I've been thinking about it, and I think I may do it in the fall.  I almost called you once from a lobby. 
[00:59:00]  I was just thinking of you, like, fucking, would you keep filming?  You got more there.  No, you're right.  I'm going to film in the fall.  What's the documentary?  Him and His Old Man.  What is it?  I took my dad on a tour.  He was 84, 85 at the time.  Bro, I'm on the...  He's a World War II vet.  Never talks about shit.  Right, of course.  Just talks about chick.  If you ask him, hey, what was the war like?  He'd go, Australia was fantastic.  I was on leave for two weeks.  That's all he'll go. 
[00:59:30]  So it really was about...  I know he's not going to be living much longer.  He's starting to get senile.  Great idea.  I brought him on the road.  It was touching.  It was sad.  It was a little disturbing at times.  It's really good.  It is.  It's really good.  I fucking love it.  It's a guy from what I saw.  I love...  That's right up my alley.  But the conclusion should be...  There's more information now.  I think he should film more with his dad now.  Yes.  He's getting worse.  See if he can talk about the war. 
[01:00:00]  Maybe he can get him to talk about it.  You know what?  They won't.  They won't.  They won't.  You see in the documentary, I ask him a million times.  But that's okay.  I mean, that would be interesting to watch you try to make him talk about it.  Not that you'd watch it.  I would watch it.  I probe him literally every fit.  We go to dinner, and I'll go, so what...  What was the worst place?  And he'll go, what the fuck do you want to know?  And I say, which island's the worst?  He goes, they're all worse.  Hey, look at that hot ass. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, shit.  Yeah, he doesn't want to fuck it.  Just to flex.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You need to flex.  But you know what?  Shit, I have Alzheimer's now, like dementia.  I was going to ask you something when you were...  Oh, so does he mind the cameras when you're shooting them?  No, he's a ham and a scene stealer.  Oh, okay.  Like, we're in...  What's great is because he's older, so we're in a diner.  And the chick comes up, and I had to edit a lot.  I mean, he drops C words.  He's really...  Are you ever in a...  You've got to keep those in. 
[01:01:00]  I had to edit.  Oh, that's great.  Go on.  Were you ever embarrassed?  Oh, my God, yeah.  Like, the one place we were at, we're in the diner, and she comes up, and he's going,  you know, he's a fag, right?  And then she'd walk away.  She's like, she's a cunt.  She didn't get it.  And then I go, oh, my God.  Oh, I didn't get it.  And then...  Like, there's something to get just by pointing at someone and saying, I need some fag.  He's a fag, you know what I mean?  Oh, I get it.  He must be a fag. 
[01:01:30]  I get it.  She didn't get it.  You would...  The best thing about him, I used to introduce him to stars, like, whenever it started.  And by far the best ever, and that was just years ago, Paul Abdul.  Just to still explain my dad.  I go to the bathroom.  We're finishing the SNL party.  I go to the bathroom, and the party's 5,000 people there, and you're kissing.  Hey, you're fucking great.  Hey, you're great.  Let's do things together.  I come back.  Let's do things together.  Did they say that at the parties? 
[01:02:00]  Oh, my God.  Every single one.  Yeah, they'll keep in touch.  I'm still looking for a job.  Yeah.  I come back, and Paul Abdul is with him, laughing.  He's naughty.  Oh, no.  Yeah, now I already know.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Something transpired.  He goes like this, which to me is still the greatest thing I've ever heard in my life.  He goes, Paula, you like playing puppy? 
[01:02:30]  And she goes, what's puppy?  That's when I sniff your ass and you just growl.  Oh, my God.  That's like he was eight.  Oh, yeah.  He's fucking, yeah.  Oh, wow.  And she's like, yeah.  Okay.  I'm going to take him home.  Now you think about your dad and what he was like on the two weeks leave in Australia that  he talks about being the greatest two weeks of his life.  How insane was that trip?  After he took out a week-long shower to take the Japanese blood off his body that you know 
[01:03:00]  he saw.  They just strung Mussolini up and killed him and then went to Australia to drink and get  laid for two weeks.  What were they saying that?  Oh, yeah.  I can only imagine what that was.  And they were conquering heroes.  That's right.  They were huge heroes.  And those guys wear those hats.  I always go up to any vet with a hat because they want you to go, hey, man, nice, nice.  All right.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:03:30]  Nice fucking hat.  Just to wear them a hat.  Thank you so much.  Oh, yeah.  I think last time I was here, right, there was a guy with a hat.  I went up to him and shot Bright.  I said, World War II vet, thank you very much.  And he goes, three years, eight months, 22 days, 1942, blah, blah, blah, we bought it.  He just rattles it off.  He just rattled the whole thing off.  Wow.  Because they want it because they know it's over.  Jap bodies up to my knees as we storm that beach.  I have a flamethrower. 
[01:04:00]  Germans coming at me from the sky.  Japanese coming at me from the ground.  We'd set them on fire so we wouldn't waste bullets.  Right.  Jesus.  Shit that we will never, ever do in our lives.  Can't comprehend it.  Shit.  You know, Derny was on Rescue Me.  And he was landed at Normandy and he was in the Battle of the Bulge.  Jesus.  He's got one half of it.  I think it's his right leg is still black from the frostbite from one of the battles.  And he's got a mark in his chest that looks like somebody took a claw hammer and dug it 
[01:04:30]  into his chest.  It's from when he was killing a Nazi guy.  Holy shit.  And the guy's hand was clawing as he was crushing the guy's face with a rock.  Charles Durning?  Charles Durning.  Wow.  Face to face and he's got a reminder like that.  But he never talked about it.  He would never talk about it.  And I couldn't get him to talk about it.  I'd write stuff into the scripts and he would say it, but he would never talk about it.  Right.  So then I went to do the Memorial Day thing one weekend when they were on the troops on PBS  with Joe Montaigne and Sinise in Washington.  And he was getting honored that year. 
[01:05:00]  And when I saw him backstage, when he was waiting to be introduced, and I saw Colin Powell and  the heads of all four military who were about to go on stage walk up individually, he was  sitting down, and shake his hand and talk to him.  I went, wow.  He did something.  He did something.  You know?  I got you.  Unbelievable.  Those guys didn't talk.  It's weird.  We never talk about it.  They say that a lot of them wish they had therapy and stuff because it was healthier.  But those guys just didn't talk about that stuff. 
[01:05:30]  I asked Durning about therapy, and this is a famous showbiz story.  I'd heard that he once held a William Morris agent outside the window who didn't pay him  upside down like 15, 20 stories in the air.  He goes, it was 15 stories, and yeah, that was my therapy after the war.  And I was like, holy shit.  I started learning about my dad by the town bully, and they were the Delapines. 
[01:06:00]  And when you grew up, and anyone that was in jail, you're like, holy shit, the fucking  Delapines are in jail.  Don't fuck with the Delapines.  Kids stole my bike and all that shit.  It was eight of them.  Three of them were armed robbery.  They were thrown in jail for armed robbery.  But they were out.  So, cut to, I'm 12 years old, and this is when I realized, like, my dad's, there's 
[01:06:30]  something fucking off with my dad.  My dad is, and he's a little guy.  He's smaller than me.  The main Delapine is on my front porch.  He rings the bell.  My dad's already passed out from the fucking beer.  My mom's three martinis in.  That was the routine.  And your dad's beer is fucking Sue Simmons.  He's out.  He's out.  He went local.  I'm going to get monkeys.  All monkeys.  All monkeys.  Let's guess who did that. 
[01:07:00]  Monkeys.  That is.  Oh, my God.  Stay on the scene.  Stay on the scene.  Oh, my God.  Oh, shit.  They're out.  They're out.  They're out.  They're out.  The door rings.  Delapines at the front door.  I actually have a heart attack.  I'm so scared.  I almost start crying.  And he goes, he's looking right past me.  He goes, we want to talk to you, Father.  I went, my father's sleeping.  And I look out.  I swear on my children's lives. 
[01:07:30]  There's three of them on my porch.  And there's two standing in my walkway and more outside their car, leaning against the car.  And I go, my dad's sleeping.  I feel a claw grab me, pull me aside.  And my father walks out on the patio.  And he goes, what is it?  Fucking one, two, three, four, five, seven.  How many in your car?  You got three fangs.  There's seven of you for one little old man? 
[01:08:00]  He goes, you may get the best of me, but one of you are going to fucking die.  Which one's it going to be?  Is it going to be you?  Is it going to be you?  Which one of you fucks are going to die tonight?  Because you're going to watch one of you fuckers die.  And my mom's like, Jesus Christ!  You're in the goddamn house and we're calling the cops and his son's a cop.  And the whole fucking delet.  Now the oldest brother's going, we're just, we're just, you hit a chain. 
[01:08:30]  You hit my little brother with a chain.  And he takes out of his back pocket the dog leash, which we had a poodle.  A little poodle.  And he's like, this is what you're worried about.  He goes, again, you got five seconds because I want to get it on.  Who's going to die?  And they were like, oh, we really apologize.  You fucking mean it.  And they left.  And that was a defining moment the rest of my life.  I just, I looked at my dad like, were you fucking crazy? 
[01:09:00]  Do you know they have guns?  He's like, oh, I fucking care.  Guns?  See, I would have loved to have one of the Delapines die in that story.  Right?  Yeah.  Right?  From a death blow to the neck as your father throws a warning shot.  Watch this.  Watch this.  The light coming out of every hole in his head.  What does he give a fuck?  He was in World War II.  He doesn't give a fuck about the Delapines.  Fuck you.  That's when I realized. 
[01:09:30]  I love your dad.  I do too.  I haven't even met him, and I love him.  I can't wait to see this fucking documentary.  That is great.  It really is good, Dennis.  You're going to love it, man.  It really is good.  A lot more people should be seeing this damn thing.  You'll fucking love it.  It's hot, man.  How long is it?  It's an hour.  I'll make it longer.  You told me, and you really made me think about it.  I'm definitely going to do it.  Now I've got a nurse, so you've got to clean.  He wears diapers and shit.  On that trip, he shit three times.  Oh, man. 
[01:10:00]  That's a rough thing to clean up.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's fun to do for a film.  You should film more if you can, though.  I am.  I am.  I just booked a whole fall tour.  Oh, you did.  I want to get a bus and just film the shit out of him.  Because he's still funny.  Yeah, he fucking sounds it, man.  He's dying.  The ambulance comes over the house.  He looks like he's dying.  Everything out of his mouth is always funny.  He always tries to be funny no matter what.  They go, Mr. Brewer, you okay? 
[01:10:30]  You're in pain?  He goes, yeah, I'm in pain.  Where's it hurt?  He goes, I'm pregnant.  I don't know who the father is.  I wouldn't tell you because then you'd start rumors.  While he's drooling and his heads are twitching.  Can you imagine what he was like in the war?  He literally was like that guy from Die Hard doing fucking one line  and a wise-ass one line is why he was telling people.  Non-stop.  He must have been a fucking blast to hang out with in the war. 
[01:11:00]  Well, you know what's funny?  Oh, man.  I would say so because as I grew up, he was just a dad.  And it was my college year where kids would go,  you're a brewer because he's a lot older.  Everyone thinks he's a grandfather.  They go, your father?  Does he drive a garbage truck?  I go, yeah.  You're like, oh, my, dude, I had your father for the time.  He's the funniest fucking guy I ever met in my life.  I'm like, my dad is the funniest fucking guy.  And as I got older, I mean, he started fights at town halls. 
[01:11:30]  He was.  Wow.  What a hero.  He was the clown of clowns.  What a hero.  But I didn't realize that as I got older.  So that's another reason I made the documentary.  You never had any war buddies come over or anything like that?  They all worked together.  They all, they all, it was really sad.  They all worked together at the sanitation place.  They all got each other jobs.  And one, two of his best friends died of a heart attack. 
[01:12:00]  They were all heavy fucking drinkers.  Can you blame them?  No.  One hung himself and one shot himself.  Jesus Christ.  My dad was the only one.  Wow.  My dad was the only one.  That's hardcore, man.  It was a group.  Yeah.  That's crazy right there.  But that makes sense, doesn't it, when you think about it?  Oh, man.  You get older, you get what they must have been through.  You can't even fucking fathom.  But he never, and what I thought was amazing, which I brought out on the doc, is that he  never put all that on me.  Right.  He was just a dad.  Right. 
[01:12:30]  Right.  He was there at the games.  He was there at the games.  He never was like, oh, you fucking.  He would have had my dangling cross-earing.  Oh, no.  Judas Priest on the bag with fucking Judas Priest, dad.  And the singer was like, yeah.  That's great.  That's great.  It's great music.  Never heard it inside.  Can you imagine what he would have said?  No.  Can you imagine?  Oh, my God.  I do.  You gotta love him for that shit.  He's fucking A.  What a guy. 
[01:13:00]  What a guy.  Yeah, he could have been that, I defended the country for this shit.  Yeah, this is what I defended him for.  You wear your faggot earring and fucking.  How's your mom doing?  I just love that he was out cold.  Just that story about the Della Pines, where he's out cold after Sue Simmons.  But as soon as there's a whiff of trouble for his son, not only is he wide awake, he's  moved the son out of the way and has taken on 15 Della Pines.  Threatening death.  And doesn't give a fuck.  That's a dad.  That's a dad. 
[01:13:30]  Oh, fuck you.  That's a dad.  I love that.  There's like two or three of those incidents that I'll remember forever and ever.  It's like an animal.  Yeah, really.  Five, ten brothers and sisters, five, just the opposite of band of brothers, all five  went to the war, all five came back.  Wow.  One was shot down in Germany, one was a prisoner of war.  I know.  Wow.  The old one came back.  You know, my Uncle Jerry came to this country and was here and to get his citizenship  had to join the army. 
[01:14:00]  So he went to Korea and fought.  Again, came back and he was fucked up and was strapped.  He always acted like he had a great time, like it was the easiest thing in the world.  But when he died and the guys that he served with came to his funeral, this is like two  years ago, we started hearing all this shit about, oh yeah, no, we used to, you know,  we used to be afraid of him because he was so fucking crazy.  And they showed us pictures.  Oh, shit.  We're looking at pictures of him on the front.  And we're going, he fucking told us he was like back in and behind the seat.  At a motor pool.  Yeah, never said anything.  You know, it's like, just, they fucking locked it up. 
[01:14:30]  They locked it up.  Threw it away.  Threw it away.  Whiskey.  And they, oh, that's why.  Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey, whiskey.  Whiskey, whiskey.  Smoke, smoke, smoke.  Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey.  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey, smoke, smoke, smoke.  Right?  Meanwhile, you're going like, you know, you're thinking everything's fine with him.  And now when he dies, you go, fucking guy was crazy.  Right.  Right?  Right.  Thank God he didn't kill you.  Right?  Thank fucking God.  When I think about how scary our dads were, you know, about, like, when we fucked up, when  they, I don't know if your dad ever threw a shot at you.  Oh, man.  He never threw a shot at you. 
[01:15:00]  My dad threw a shot at my older brother who challenged him once, Kiwi.  Kiwi was my, he came home drunk after a fight.  My uncle Danny was a police officer.  He called him, he said, he's fucking in a fight with a bunch of guys with shovels.  My dad was like, that, that, that, that.  And he came home, and he walked in the front door.  He was already drunk, and he went to the refrigerator, and he opened it up, and he grabbed the beer.  And my old man went, you crack open that beer, I'll knock you out with one fucking punch.  And my brother was huge.  You know, he's bigger than my dad.  And he cracked the beer, and I'll never forget it.  He hit him, and he, it was like slow motion, he went backwards, and his head hit the linoleum.  He was already out. 
[01:15:30]  So hard.  My mother went, you killed him!  And my old man, he hit him, and he walked away and lit up a cigarette.  Like, I told him I was going to fucking hit him.  Yeah, right?  There it is.  This is my...  When you think about what's really in their heads from World War II...  Right.  Fuck it.  No.  Crazy.  It is pretty wild.  It's nuts, man.  It's amazing they could live a normal life, you know?  That's what blows me away, too.  I learned a lot.  You know, because I have sisters, and that, and...  Yeah.  Yeah, it was fucking, this happened to me as a kid.  Anyone that brings up the violin story... 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  ...pretty much about anything...  Like, listen, fuck off.  Fuck off.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  These guys are everything.  Fuck, yeah.  And they did what you saw.  They were great Americans.  Hey, listen, and that fucking cliche is true.  We wouldn't fucking be here if they didn't win that fucking war.  It's that simple.  They took on the whole fucking world, and kicked the world's ass, and came home.  Right.  And then kept their mouths shut, and became dads.  And gave us, like, plasma fucking TVs, and college, and all the shit that we have comes  from those...  That's why we have this shit. 
[01:16:30]  You're listening.  ...to the worst of the Opie and Anthony show, Sirius XM.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  My name is E-Rock.  Looking back at the summer of 2012, it's the last day of summer.  Hope you're doing something good, because otherwise you wasted the whole fucking season.  In this segment here, it's a little montage of stuff involving Chip.  Starting off with Chip going out to San Diego Comic-Con, and doing what he does best, interview  all the people on the Comic-Con floor. 
[01:17:00]  And then right after that, Chip decided to develop a brand new bit this summer, called  Go to Break.  What is that?  You'll have to wait and see.  Chip at Comic-Con, then Chip goes to break, starting now.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Want some Chip audio before we get out of here?  A little bit.  Certainly.  A little bit, and we'll get out of here.  Chip, uh...  And then we'll get out of here.  Yes.  And then we'll get out of here.  Yes.  Apparently, uh...  Chip doesn't give a fuck about much.  He doesn't give a fuck about the cops.  Nope.  He doesn't give a fuck about anything.  He's great like that. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  A rebel.  And, uh, this time, Chip wanted to kind of fit in more with the crowd, so he got some  funny hats and paraphernalia to wear while he was doing the interviews.  I gotta get a look for Chip.  I gotta be...  And believe me, I'm not so pompous that I get recognized, not all over, but there are  times where I do and it's a little counteractive.  Like, when I see guys wait, like fans, it becomes harder to do.  So I've been wearing these weird hats and just literally trying to find Chip's look  where it doesn't look like me. 
[01:18:00]  Mm-hmm.  Blending a little bit?  Yeah.  Well, here's, uh...  Is it comical or comic?  Chip thinks it's comical-con.  I think it's comical-con, then.  Yeah, comical-con.  I think it's probably comical.  This is Dave Warren at comical-con.  Yeah.  Some highlights.  Chip wearing a green hat annoys some guy.  That was a frog hat.  Yeah.  Some guys on stilts.  This is just...  I hate stilts!  This one was just...  It was just...  We were, like, giggling about this for real.  It was just so obnoxious.  Yeah, there's, like, four or five of them on stilts.  They're, like, eight...  They might have been ten feet up.  Yeah. 
[01:18:30]  Hi, you're on Chipper TV on YouTube.  How tall are you?  Much taller than you, my strange friend.  Wow.  I don't like to look there.  I got that thing right in my face or something.  You're welcome.  Thank you.  My hat is green with envy.  Show how tall these guys are.  I like a professional-looking sister.  Thanks.  You guys are tall.  Oh, jeez.  You are tall.  What else?  Use your words. 
[01:19:00]  How tall are you supposed to be?  As tall as we are.  Wow.  And not any taller.  These guys are big.  These guys are very tall.  How many hits are you going to get on?  Probably, hopefully, a lot of Chipper TV on YouTubes.  Oh, my God, you're tall.  That don't make no sense.  You couldn't even keep a straight face.  I can't.  It was so ridiculous.  It was so ridiculous.  Just trying to see how long you could stand in front of those guys commenting on them being tall.  I was like getting annoyed.  They're all characters dressed like fucking...  It was just this dope in a green frog hat going, you're tall. 
[01:19:30]  So, as I look at the next track, you didn't like your green frog hat and decided to change your look for the next one, right?  What was the next one?  I remember.  Wearing a stuffed mustache.  What's a stuffed mustache?  Oh, God, the little brown mustache I wore.  Yeah.  What is it called a stuffed mustache?  Well, because it's made of felt with cotton.  So, it's like a coat, and it's got a little elastic band on it.  It's a very thick mustache.  It's like wearing a little sock on your face.  Yeah, it's like a stuffed animal, but it's a mustache with an elastic band, so you wear it. 
[01:20:00]  Oh.  Why would you wear something like that?  Because a bunch of dorks go to Comic Con.  I don't know.  Excuse me, sir.  Can we interview you for Chippa TV for the YouTubes?  Sure.  We're talking to people in costumes and stuff.  What's your name?  My name is Victor.  Hi, Victor.  Where are you from?  Originally born in Los Angeles, but I live here in San Diego.  Oh, okay.  That's a cool hat.  It probably keeps all the rain out of your eyes.  And the sun.  And the sun and everything else.  The moon and whatnot.  Now, what is your character costume supposed to be?  This is Lord Raiden from Mortal Kombat. 
[01:20:30]  Oh.  What does Lord Raiden do?  He is the overlord of the...  Well, he protects Earthrealm from the outworld.  Is that a comic book, or is it a cartoon, or is it an animated series, or is it a graphic novel?  Well, what is that?  The original concept came from a video game, and then it morphed into the movies as well  as comic books.  I can't breathe with this fucking mustache on.  I think you should take it off before you die.  I had a hat on before, but people kept saying, you're like a fucking asshole, so I put the 
[01:21:00]  mustache on.  Now I can't fucking breathe.  Thank you.  People don't know how to deal with it.  He's not very professional at interviewing people.  No, not at all.  And it's like, every time he tries to go with them, like, oh, you should take it off.  Chip is just on another planet.  He gets fucking nasty.  Like, yeah, they're trying to have all fun with Chip, like, oh, he's a goofy guy.  And he just starts cursing.  He's got no semblance of what's appropriate or what wavelengths were on here. 
[01:21:30]  What an asshole.  No.  Oh, Chip.  And he's just sitting there the whole time.  It'll be on the videos because it doesn't make sense for the audio, but just riffing  on stuff.  And everybody's just walking by, like, looking at me.  Yeah, like, what?  Do you have the lady in the purple?  Oh, yeah.  Is that the next one?  Because I guess she didn't like your mustache look, so now you're wearing an elephant hat.  Yeah, the hat, like a little elephant tromb.  You'll see it all on the video.  I've got to put up one more part of the UFC videos before I put these up. 
[01:22:00]  But I don't think this is her yet.  Okay.  Okay, but Chip's wearing an elephant hat to interview this lady.  Right.  Hi, ladies.  Hello.  Can we talk to you for Chippa TV on YouTube?  Sure.  What's your name?  My name is Demetria, but I'm cosplaying Misfortune.  Misfortune?  Yes.  My mother said I have a lot of Misfortune.  Where are you from?  I'm from the video game Skullgirls.  What is that?  It's a new video game that came out. 
[01:22:30]  It's a 2B fighter game.  It's really cool.  Oh.  How old are you?  I am 18.  Oh, cool.  Okay.  Because I can't talk to nobody under 18.  I got in trouble for that.  Oh.  What's the little horns on your head?  Like you're very devilish or something.  Oh, no.  There's supposed to be cat ears, but I didn't.  Cat ears?  Oh, cat ears.  I thought you said cat ears.  I'm like, what are you playing golf or something?  But there's supposed to be cat ears on the train.  It's really rushed, so.  They look good, though.  They look like, I mean, I was in a rush.  I forgot to pack my trunk. 
[01:23:00]  Oh, no.  He's talking about the, then, that's why it was important.  You pointed right to your trunk.  Yeah.  Because the elephant hat has a trunk on it.  Yeah.  So he said, I forgot to pack my trunk.  Trunk.  From 1940 when people had trunks when they traveled.  That's hilarious.  Did you guys get the cat ears?  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  They look good, though.  They look like, I mean, I was in a rush.  I forgot to pack my trunk. 
[01:23:30]  Um, where do you live?  I live in Modesto.  So what does your character do?  My character is a fighter.  She's a cat burglar as well. </pre>
