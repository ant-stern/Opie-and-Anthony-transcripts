<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony XM Satellite Radio show began with a discussion about Lush bath products, specifically the hosts' and guest Jim Norton's dislike of their soap but appreciation for their shower gel. This transitioned into a lengthy segment on tribute bands, sparked by a new Foreigner CD. The conversation explored the authenticity of bands continuing with replacement members, using Foreigner, Journey, and others as examples.  Numerous listener calls contributed anecdotes about various tribute bands (Ozzy Osbourne, Kiss, Pearl Jam, etc.), interspersed with audio clips of these bands, which the hosts critiqued.  The documentary "Tribute" was mentioned.  The hosts contrasted their commercial-free XM show with commercial radio's heavy ad load.  Throughout this section, and indeed the entire show, the hosts engaged in crude and offensive jokes, including racist slurs and genitalia-related humor.

The show continued with a focus on listener-submitted recordings of tribute bands, many featuring racially diverse lineups which prompted more racist jokes from the hosts and callers.  One submission was deemed "over the line" and promised to be posted online.  Listener calls added to the often-racist humor, with some callers expressing disapproval.  Jim Norton called in again, primarily to promote his shows. A discussion about navigation systems and a funny anecdote about an oversized GPS device followed. The segment concluded with an XM Satellite Radio commercial and an advertisement for the "O&A Party Rock."

The next segment started with Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton signing publicity photos, with Norton defacing the others' photos.  They shared anecdotes of intentionally ruining photos for fans.  Carson from "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy," a studio guest, was the target of homophobic jokes about his appearance and sexuality, alongside discussions of other celebrities deemed "gay" by the hosts.  The conversation shifted to a news story about a drunk man stealing a plane with two 16-year-old passengers. The hosts discussed the absurdity and lack of legal consequences. A caller shared a similar story with a fatal outcome, followed by Opie recounting his brother's reckless piloting.  The discussion touched on the dangers of untrained flying, referencing JFK Jr.'s fatal crash.

The hosts then reacted to a new New York law ("Mr. Softy Bill") banning registered sex offenders from working on ice cream trucks, leading to sexually suggestive and offensive jokes about pedophilia.  Intern Harry T. was exposed for submitting fake feedback requests under an assumed name.  The show then covered the NYPD's first openly transsexual officer, June Lowe (formerly John Lowe), with the hosts making numerous transphobic jokes and comments about her transition and speculating on colleagues' reactions.  They referenced an online message board discussing the situation. A pre-recorded phone interview with Jim Norton (intended for a different show) was played. The segment concluded with more jokes and banter.  Various celebrity voice impressions were used throughout.


A later segment heavily focused on the transgender NYPD officer, with hosts and callers sharing anecdotes and opinions, ranging from humorous to highly offensive and derogatory comments.  The conversation broadened to encompass societal reactions to transgender individuals, particularly in law enforcement. Callers shared often judgmental and vulgar descriptions of their experiences with transgender people.  One caller recounted a police officer's transition while on vacation, another discussed a friend's brother's transition, focusing on aesthetics and family reactions. Graphic descriptions of sex and sexual acts and repeated use of homophobic and transphobic slurs were prevalent. The hosts also discussed a future segment featuring a female band and sexual devices. Comedian Joey Diaz called in briefly.  Technical difficulties with a host's iPod further sidetracked the conversation. A picture of Tula, a transitioned former Bond girl, was mentioned and shown.  The show ended with a Stephen Lynch song about a hermaphrodite and further discussion of technical issues.

[00:05:30]  gentlemen please  rest your sphincters  gentlemen please  good morning  it's the Opie and Anthony program  on XM Satellite Radio  big hi to the brand new listeners  oh yeah  every day you got some of those  you get email from the brand new listeners  that are stumbling on the show  some old fans that finally said  ah yeah 
[00:06:00]  there's nothing going on in commercial radio  I gotta go listen to the boys again  let me check this out  and then you got like  new listeners in the middle of nowhere  that have no idea what we're about  but slowly learning  I thought I had on  this morning  I was  starting my  my hygiene this morning  before I leave  you know  on the bathroom  turn on the radio  and I thought I had one of the news stations on  either CBS  or  or  1010 wins 
[00:06:30]  here in New York  yeah your news stations  yeah the all news stations  find out what's going on  but I made a mistake  I guess I had a  WABC on  so Curtis and Kubi are on  they do the morning show  here in New York  one of them  and  I didn't hear their show  again  pure commercials  it was just a commercial fest  they popped in for  I think like a minute  for a quick thing  that they do I guess  some quick news thing 
[00:07:00]  where they just did a couple of news stories  didn't riff on it or anything  just blurted out a couple of stories  and then went well  we'll be right back  and more commercials  and then I remember reading something  that they had some of the highest commercial loads  in the city  and I was stunned  I'm sitting there going  I've got to get a friggin XM radio  in the bathroom here  got them all over the house  but just don't have one in the bathroom  because you know  you're just in there shower  taking a dump  or something like that  usually if I'm taking a dump  I read a popular science  or popular mechanics 
[00:07:30]  very good dump magazine  by the way  so  so I have regular radio in there  and I realized  I barely hear  anything but commercials  whether I tried  tried out the new  Jack format  I popped that on  when I was in the shower  one day  and heard  nothing  I did not get to one song  another time driving in  I figured I'd give Jack  Jack a try  because I was going through  the tunnel during traffic  nothing  the whole time  from the inside of the tunnel  until I popped out the other end  during traffic  nothing  I'm stunned 
[00:08:00]  I'm thinking they're playing a joke  on everybody now  and just playing  24 hours of commercials  unbelievable  that these people  just cannot see  they've got blinders on  and can't understand  what satellite radio  is doing to them  yeah  but don't you wish  we could go back  to commercial radio  it's an easy gig now  what a breeze  that would be  oh my god  after doing nine months  of satellite radio  where we do  hour and a half  at a clip  without taking one break  now if we went back  to commercial radio  you're trying to tell me  we would only have to talk  for like 15 minutes  at a time 
[00:08:30]  dude  that would rock  15 minutes  and then you get  10 minutes  of drinking  playing foosball  hanging out  like the old days  and then you run back in  oh we gotta do  15 more minutes  right  what a breeze  that was  that would be great  of course it was  you gotta admit  that would be great  it would suck  for the listeners  but man fuck them  oh there's a good question  even though they got  the person wrong  Tim on Long Island  go ahead  yo Anthony  I was wondering  if you used your  soap from Lush  this morning 
[00:09:00]  ah Tim  you're trying to be  a smart ass  but if you listen  to the show  I didn't join them  for the big  Lush shopping spree  that they all went on  how uh boys  how did your  Lush soaps turn out  we were we were  in Washington D.C.  and uh  one night  I usually like  just barricading myself  in the hotel room  I always like  barricading myself  in the hotel room  let's use the proper word  always  getting room service  watching movies  but uh  the guys all went out  and uh  ended up in a 
[00:09:30]  soap store  called Lush  and you all  picked up your  various soaps  scented soaps  I hate  my Lush  products  Opie  what happened  I love this  it's an update  I don't know  what did we get  that uh  black  coal soap  thing  coal face soap  which is good  for the face  and then other  yeah but  what do you  sing mammy  when you're  all lathered up  with it  it's like  a licorice  it has a licorice  uh  licorice  or something  yeah  it's good  it's awful 
[00:10:00]  and then  I'm like washing  my armpits  with Twizzlers  what kind of  licorice soap  could you  what could that  do for you  and you never get  a good lather up  it's like watery  and then like  it's supposed to  have like sand  in it so you know  that uh  sand  watery  no lather  it's not soap  exfoliates or whatever  there you go  I like an exfoliating  soap  but uh  there's only sand  on the like  the edge  on one side of it  cause obviously  the sand  went down  to the bottom  as the soap  is forming  I guess  oh they can't  keep it suspended  no  it stinks 
[00:10:30]  that's awful  my bar lasted  like a week  did you throw it away  no it just disintegrated  to nothing  in a week  okay  how much was it  I'm trying to remember  it was like  twelve dollars  twelve thirteen dollars  twelve bucks  twelve bucks  one bar soap  twelve thirteen dollars  something like that  you know how many bars  of caress  I could buy  for twelve bucks  I don't mind  the uh  the shower gel though  the mint shower gel  good stuff  yeah it gives you  a little tingle  in the morning  like ooh  you put it on your bag 
[00:11:00]  a little bit  a little bit on the bag  for that little tingle  in the shower  just a slight tingle  nothing too crazy  nothing that's gonna  make you uncomfortable  just enough to make you  feel alive  like whoa hey  what's that  hey  a little cool breeze  so I don't mind  my mint shower gel  crap  but that soap  was garbage  I love it  you love it  I love my lush products  I do  you do  I have my black face soap  and I also have my  black face soap 
[00:11:30]  the lemon  the lemon is the regular soap  yeah  I actually went  I found the lush in New York here  stop it  I went in the other day  and spent some more money  on products  you  are you kidding  you went into the lush New York  and got more soap  another eighty dollars  down the toilet  eighty dollars worth of soap  no soap  no no no  oh what'd you get  I've been going to the steam room lately  and apparently it makes you  break out and get oily  just to push a lot of crap  out of your skin  yeah  you know how it is  when you're buff  so I have to  of course  I decided I wanted to get some stuff  for my face  just so it doesn't get oily 
[00:12:00]  and pimply and stuff  and I went into lush  and I bought  this little thing  that you dip your thumb in  it's like a  it's like a weird  it looks like dirt almost  and you wet it  and you wash your face  and then I bought some  like what's the stuff  that you rub on your face  it's like a  cock  no  Jesus  it's like a 
[00:12:30]  third grader pitching to me  like a little  lobbing softball  coming at you  I didn't put my glove up  I just kind of stood there  and looked at it  Jesus  wow  fucking yogurt on me  I actually  I know when we first went  into lush in Washington  down there in Georgetown  that it was faggoty  but that was just  one of those goofy things  that we did as a bunch of guys  I'm not going to the lush store  in New York  well you did it as a little novelty thing 
[00:13:00]  Jimmy enjoys the product  I made a lifestyle choice  Jimmy you did  I bought  I bought the facial things  or things that you put on  the uh  the mask  a mask  you put on a mask  and sit there  for ten minutes  it's called cupcake  is the mask  it smells like cupcake  it's called cupcake  that's the name  you put it in the refrigerator  you fuck me  I don't fuck me  I see you putting his mask on  shoving his friggin nuts  between his legs  cupcake  I put on my cupcake mask  I do ten minutes 
[00:13:30]  and believe me  it's brown all over my face  so you're used to it  believe me  that he already did occur to me  and this removes dirt  and then I put a little bit of lotion on after  like a little moisturizer  a little moisturizer  of course  and it keeps your skin young and supple  well I was looking  I had noticed that in my nose pores  were just awful  my face was dirty  yeah  yeah I hadn't  I mean I washed my face  but I didn't know I ever had my face cleaned  so when you pull that mask off  you look at it  no no no  it doesn't come off like that 
[00:14:00]  you just wash it off  oh you wash it off  it's not one of those where it's like  no I wish it was  the what are the  Biore strips  or whatever they were called  oh yeah the blackhead  the blackhead strips  yeah you put them on your nose  and peel it off  and it's like stalagmites  of friggin blackheads on it  oh do those hurt  I don't know  I never use them  no you gotta leave them on  but you put it on  and then they yank out  a bunch of blackheads  and then you yank it off  and it like pulls out  anything that's in your pores  it's gotta hurt  no  I don't think it hurts  but I think it would take  some getting used to  because I think if you do it  the first couple of times  you're really gonna get a rash  um  this is the gayest 
[00:14:30]  friggin discussion we've had  why we have to take care of ourselves  we're talking about  friggin beauty tips  it's called being a  metrosexual  I guess  even men these days  in the city here  are doing things  getting manicures  and facials  and  shaving their arms  shaving their arms  and  I went for the summer  shave down  did ya?  yeah  you shaved your arms?  not bald  just like  what did you do?  stop it  look  why do you shave your arms? 
[00:15:00]  cause I get  they're a man's arms  no cause it gets really hairy  how hairy do your arms get?  and I work out a lot  it gets sweaty and maddy  so I just  holy jeez  but look  dude I still have hair  I didn't go bald  how  you just take a  you just take the shaver  he does it too  yeah I know I do  I'm not throwing you  to the bottom  he shaves it  you have to  I get it  no but I'm a gorilla  your hair is really fine  no  I'll say  fine  wispy even  no I just get the  the shaver  or whatever  and knock it down  to a three  or whatever 
[00:15:30]  and just clean it up  that's all  oh really?  he shaves it  with a razor  I do the full razor  you shave your arms  with a razor  thank god Steve  yeah  look it's obvious  because the rest of me  is all gorilla  you are a bear  cozy bear  big hairy  cozy thing  cub cuddler  yeah it's  horribly vain  and egocentric  I still have more hair  on my arms  than like Jim Norton  and young Eric here  I feel my arms  I have no  Jimmy doesn't shave 
[00:16:00]  his arms or anything  he's got little  wispy hairs  I have hardly  any body hair at all  yeah  I don't need to shave  so anyway  Steve also  Steve also went  to the Lush store  down there in Georgetown  we haven't gotten  his update yet  I still have  about half of each  bar left  how do you enjoy  your soaps?  you know what  I got the same  sand one  the same sand filled one  sandstone  sorry  sandstone  which one was that  the black one?  no this is the  the one that kind of  looks greenish and yellow  with some white  white chunks  but all the sand 
[00:16:30]  is collected at the bottom  and it's supposed to  exfoliate  like Siskel's brain  you're just describing  wow  but I guess it's supposed  to exfoliate  and you wind up  looking like you just  the bathtub looks like  you just got done  showering off  after the beach  and when you're all done  sand  yeah all the sand  comes off  and you clog the drain  with sand  so it's kind of  counterproductive  in that sense  but you're exfoliating  yes  even the bottoms  of your feet  yes  in the shower  yes  it's a horribly  sand all over the floor 
[00:17:00]  stupid vein ritual  it really is  what's your favorite?  the pink rockstar soap  is nice  oh god  it's got a nice aroma  did you get any  and I  I forgot to mention  not to be dishonest  but the pink rockstar  reminded me  that when I was there  this time  I bought  I bought the  the bath bombs  oh you know what  I do want to try a bath  isn't it like a big  Alka-Seltzer  pretty much  yeah  and I have a nice  deep tub  perfect for a nice  did you try it?  not yet  no I want to wait  for the perfect time  with a little music 
[00:17:30]  and candles  no I'm kidding  just sit on the big disc  and let it just  bubble up your ass  and around your sack  that'll feel good  I want to take  a nice bubble bath  and what is that  supposed to do?  it's like an effervescent  kind of sparkling  like bathing in Perrier  yes  this stuff does nothing  absolutely nothing  does nothing  you just get a bar  of Dove  and it does the same thing  it washes you  your whole body  would smell like  whatever the bath bomb  was I would assume  because it's soaking 
[00:18:00]  into your pores  I haven't noticed  anyone wafting  any scents around here  like a fine soap  or anything  because we're not  everyone just kind of  smells like nothing  I smell good  do you?  yeah  you have to smell  my lower stomach  while Steve's in here  he just handed me  a disc of  the brand new  Foreigner  yeah  this goes back  to a discussion  we've had over the years  where these bands  that we all grew up with  they're going to go on 
[00:18:30]  forever  eventually there's going to be  no original members  and these band names  will just go on forever  as like a franchise  I'm telling you  and Foreigner  is getting a little closer  a lot closer actually  so you hear  Foreigners playing  say you're a big  Foreigner fan  kill yourself  you decide you want  to go see the band  you wouldn't be seeing  the original Foreigner  that had all those  hits in the 70s  the last time  I saw Foreigner 
[00:19:00]  with Lou Graham  and that was opening  for Journey  maybe six years ago  so six years ago  and it wasn't  the original Journey  because Steve Perry  right and that was  yeah Steve  Jerry was now in the band  so I mean  it was already going on then  but there's really  no career bands left  so people are  so these career bands  still have these  reasonably large following  so they're all making  another run at the money  well Leonard Skinner  is a classic example  they had like what  ten members originally  something crazy like that  they're down to about two  yeah I think the two guitarists  are the only remaining guys 
[00:19:30]  I could be wrong about that  I'm looking at the picture  and I'm seeing guys  that were probably  five years old  when Foreigner was out  yeah  you got guys from  80's hair bands  that are now replacing  that are now  three-fifths of that band  Jason Bonham is playing  with Foreigner  is he really?  he played with Sabbath  when Bill Ward  was too sick to play  yeah he's like  the resident  go around  and fill in  for drummers  but he's now playing  in Foreigner  without Lou Graham  is the point I'm getting at  right  Lou Graham was kind of  you know  he was Foreigner 
[00:20:00]  let's  well when you have  a strong vocalist  like that  it's uh  you know  it really stands out  he was old and fat  in the 70's  I mean Mary Tyler Moore  you could see  that he really was  not doing too well  Lou  how's the brain tumor  Lou?  is that what happened  with Lou Graham right?  yeah he got sick  I think  he's got a brain tumor  something like that  yeah  Lou  he has the chemo 
[00:20:30]  Lou  what's the scumbags  we are on this show  oh I know  oh please  but these bands  I mean  you can think of  a ton of examples  where they're running  out of members  but the bands  are continuing  and they're quite successful  Leonard Skinner  still you know  putting out  original material  the back catalog  still sells  yeah so they  so they go out  Van Halen did it  last year  you fast forward  another maybe 10 years  and so many of these bands  will have absolutely  no original members  and it'll still be  the name of the band  and then the bands  that kind of faded away 
[00:21:00]  from recently  feel that they can  make some bucks  so they come back out  and start doing their thing  you'll see people like  you know  Pearl Jam  things like that  Soundgarden probably  when there's a whole  grunge resurgence  when that becomes big  because you know  the 80s kind of  has it's little  wave that comes up  and then the 90s  will be  all those bands  and they'll get together  and throw a tour together  and  all the 80s 
[00:21:30]  hard rock bands  are out doing  package tours now  because you can't  put them out  by themselves  but if you put  six of them  on the same bill  and put them  out to fairgrounds  they can draw crowds  and the rubes  in the Midwest  love this shit  my favorite moment  of 80s  rock  getting back together  history  was Warrant  oh yeah  the Warrant story  when Warrant's  playing in front of  a lackluster  crowd of  tens of people  and the drummer  does a little solo  stands up  and throws his sticks  into the crowd  and you actually  heard the sticks 
[00:22:00]  go  clink  clink  clink  clink  clink  on the floor  no one  there  he saw a lot  of people  in front of the stage  just assuming  like the whole  club was packed  but he threw  the sticks  over the crowd  lights were in his eyes  and you see  like the first  maybe five  people deep  and that was  it  so he threw  his sticks  into the crowd  and you actually  heard  clink  clink  clink  clink  clink  clink  clink  clink  clink  clink  embarrassing  well here's the new 
[00:22:30]  foreigner  let's get a taste  of this  this could lead  into our tribute  band discussion  by the way  because this is  like a tribute  band  now it's tribute  band  it's not the band  stop  I know Mick  Jones thinks he's  important as far as  foreigner goes  but when you lose  the lead singer  then your band  is a tribute band  if you have a very  distinctive voice  as a lead singer  it's very hard  to replace that  person  there are some  bands  I don't know  if I can even  come up with  an example  but the singer  didn't have really  a very distinctive  voice 
[00:23:00]  but he really  had that voice  where it was like  you heard it  and knew it was  foreigner  or you try to find  somebody that can  mimic your lead singer  yeah  which is what  Judas Priest did  which is what  Journey did  and on and on  ACDC  yep  alright so you got  Mick Jones  ACDC  you mean after  Brian Johnson  not there anymore  no he's there  but they were  they were quite  successful way  before he  took over  on lead vocals  and he tried  to imitate it  first and then  he found his  own voice 
[00:23:30]  pretty much  right  right  alright so it's  Mick Jones  is in the band  still  and Jeff Jacobs  who the hell  was Jeff Jacobs  I just knew  Lou Graham  and Mick Jones  what about  the inimitable  Tom Gimble  keyboard player  I don't know  yeah right  who is he  I don't know  who is Tom Gimble  oh he's another  original member  I don't think  I think he's a  long time member  I don't think  he's an original  member  oh long time  member  yeah  as it said  long time  members  Jeff Jacobson 
[00:24:00]  Tom Gimble  and they're joined  by brand new  vocalist Kelly  Hansen  from the band  Hurricane  no  he was in the  band Hurricane  back in the 80s  and then they  brought in  Jeff Pilsen  named their band  after Ben's hairdo  Jeff Pilsen  from Dockin  and then  Jason Bonham  doing some  drumming  and this is how  it sounds  it sounds like  a tribute band  yep  that sounds  just like him 
[00:24:30]  you're as cold  as ice  you're willing  to sacrifice  our love  that's not bad  no  that sounds  like him  the piano's not  prominent enough  though  that guy's got 
[00:25:00]  a great  friggin voice  holy shit  yep  he definitely  pulls it off  right  and Farner  that's what it is  pretty dated music  but  that's some range  on that guy  holy jesus  do you hear  I want to know  what love is  that song's pretty heavy  that's also like 
[00:25:30]  way up there  hard to sing  these songs  I like when the music  is there  and it's like  alright  yeah  it sounds  exactly like  the band  he's nailing the vocals 
[00:26:00]  he sounds different  than Lou Graham  it's not like  Lou Graham's book  but he's hitting  every note  he can't re-run  the lyrics  stormy sea  it brings out  the man in me  now I really  help myself  you're all in the world  to me 
[00:26:30]  it feels like  the first time  it feels like  the very first time  poor Lou Graham  laying in his hospital bed  with an anvil  on his head  just looking  going  oh  they replaced me  oh  that's horrible  that's gotta suck  big booey  on top of his head  you know  when they went to him  and said 
[00:27:00]  look  you know  Lou  we'd love to have you  we gotta move on  we got bills to pay  and stuff  you know that  Lou probably gave you  his blessing  and then secretly  he's hoping  that they wouldn't  find someone  that was that  good  yeah  now they found  a guy that  could pretty much  do Lou Graham's job  there are a lot  of singers  that were in  80s bands  that didn't make  money  you know  the whole scene  disintegrated  so now they're  looking for jobs  do you think  that Lou Graham  is finished  or will he be okay  do you mean  does anybody know  I've heard rumors  that he's in bad shape  I don't know  I don't think  I do 
[00:27:30]  ah  they're valid  what's this one  I want to know  what love is  no  how many thousand  times did you  play this on VAB  foreigner waiting  for a girl like you  on the home  of rock and roll  so long  I've been looking  too hard  I've been waiting  too long  sometimes I don't 
[00:28:00]  know what  I will find  I only know  it's a matter of time  when you love  someone  when you love  the 80s bands  always had that  high range  so a lot of  the singers  can cut  these songs  I want to hear  them hit the  high note  here  here comes the chorus 
[00:28:30]  sometimes I want  to be sure  everybody  I've been waiting  oh shit  bye bye Lou  Graham  that's amazing  pretty good  the music sucks  ass  but fuck  you can sing  I think I hit  those notes  and he's not even 
[00:29:00]  straining  nope  that's not struggling  at all  I've been waiting  that's something  there's an example  oh poor Lou  Graham  they don't need  Lou anymore  then Mick will  retire  and then this  will be another  band that has  no original  members  that continues  with the name  Foreigner  but why are they  remaking the same  stuff  I mean it sounds  great but why  not just  there's a market  out there  people don't want  to hear new  foreign music  they want to  hear the old  shit  so they pack  these places  with a bunch  of people that  are trying to  recapture a little  night of their  youth  no no no I  understand 
[00:29:30]  certainly  but why not  just put out  a little bit  of new  why are you  putting out  a studio CD  with the guys  singing old  stuff  they will  but right now  that's marketable  all over the  world  they can make  a ton of  money  then do a  new album  which no one  will buy  but they can  still tour  behind it  here's what I'm  saying  when Ozzy  left Sabbath  Dio comes in  and does new  stuff  but when he  sang live  he would do  all war pigs  and he'd do  it his own way  and he actually  did a good  job with it  but it was  totally different  he wasn't  trying to do  an impression  and say why  is this guy  just re-singing  old songs  instead of  just  you know  what I mean  I don't understand  why I just  go out and tour  why remake  the same stuff  I think enough  time's gone by 
[00:30:00]  too  how much time  went by  between the time  Ozzy left  and Dio came in  a year  a year  see that's nothing  you can continue  it like it's  the band  that's still  putting out  new music  this is  Farner  it's like  so many years  have gone by  people don't care  they're irrelevant  as a new band  you know  Sabbath was still  relevant as a band  but I want to know  what love is man  I hear that song  let's listen to the words  I want to know  what my diagnosis is  they're not bathing  with lush soap 
[00:30:30]  though  Jesus  no they're not  every time they take a bath  most of their hair  falls out  old gurney body  Jesus  Bruce in New York  what's up  yeah  I just can't  do the music  it needs a lot more  cowbell  needs more cowbell  cowbell  yeah  oh sorry  Jeremy what's up  hey  it'll be Anthony  hey Cricket Dick  hey listen  you guys are talking  about  replacement singers  and TV bands  and all this  I went and saw 
[00:31:00]  Sticks  about three or four  years ago  all the original  members except  DeYoung  Ronnie DeYoung  the guy that  was the original  lead singer  Dennis DeYoung  Dennis DeYoung  what's that  it's Dennis DeYoung  sir  not Ronnie DeYoung  that's right  it's Ronnie DeMeo  who was the killer  in the Amityville Horror  and it's Dennis DeYoung  that's right  anyway  Ronnie James DeYoung  is out doing  a lounge act  he's like doing  the whole  Wayne Newton thing  singing to  roomfuls of 
[00:31:30]  40 and 50 year old  some odd ladies  that's  that's you know  his legacy  that's what he ended up doing  guy's gotta eat  I like Mr. Roboto  I actually like Sticks  I don't  hate to admit that  I do  Mr. Roboto  you don't like that  of all the songs  you could possibly like  I don't necessarily like  the chorus  but I like the  regular  except when they go  I've got a secret  a secret secret  I don't care for that part  do you really  I wonder what it is  Ed in Texas  what's up Ed 
[00:32:00]  oh not much guys  I'm just gonna let  Jimmy know  he'll know what love is  if he gets one of those  bath bombs  lifts his ball sack  places it down over there  and lets that thing  tickle his balls  to delight  he'll be  traipsing down the streets  of New York  with his little  bag of  bag bombs  I would think  you'd be tempted  to do that  put that big  Alka Seltzer  in that bathtub  and just let it  tickle your sack  no I'm not into  any foreign things  on my ball bag  or my mule  it does nothing  not on it  just the bubbles  in the water 
[00:32:30]  nah I'll just  let it bubble up  a little bit  I'll let it kind of  wash my whole body  in that sensation  it's gonna sting  nice  and it's gonna mess up  your tub  no  I'm thinking  you're in there  and the bubbles  are coming up  and they're releasing  gases  and you're breathing  it in  it's like you're not  getting as much oxygen  as you probably should  what do you think  happens when you're  laying under a girl  yeah  please  if I can live with that  a little bath bomb  isn't gonna kill  you're getting  who I'm talking to  Sean in Jersey 
[00:33:00]  what's up Sean  hey everyone  hey hello Jimmy  hey fella  a few years ago  I went to go see  Skid Row  over at PNC  and it was  Skid Row  Poison  and Vince Neal  Poison was great  but Skid Row  didn't even have  Sebastian Bach  it was all the  original members  and this new guy  who was horrible  I don't even know  why they did that  yeah that's  that's a tough  singer to replace  obviously  well Sebastian  has a huge range  and it's difficult  to find a good  the guy they got  sort of sounds like him  but that was more 
[00:33:30]  of an attitude thing  they just couldn't  deal with Bach's ego  anymore so  alright  he couldn't even  hit the notes  Bach hit  not many people  could  we should talk  about tribute bands  I love Anthony's  Brothers  Journey tribute band  phenomenal  Journey one  yeah  I mean the U2 one  is awesome as well  but  yeah he goes around  with the U2 one  a lot more than  the Journey one  but the Journey one  pops up  and it's just  because Hugo  the singer looks  just like Steve Perry  sounds just like him  and it's one of those  things  and the crowd 
[00:34:00]  did he have a tryout  with Journey  yeah  or is that just a rumor  no no that happened  when they were looking  to replace Steve Perry  when he left  they went to Hugo  and wanted him  to sing for Journey  he looks like the guy  he sounds like the guy  wasn't that what killed it though  the resemblance was too creepy  yeah  yeah it was a little  too much  and Hugo had something  going that he  kind of wanted to pursue  but yeah  it just looked  he looked too much  like the guy  so he could have been  in Journey  kind of turns it down  because he had 
[00:34:30]  other things going on  and now he sings  in a Journey tribute band  on the side  exactly  when he feels like it  yeah  that's pretty amazing  isn't that a little much  I still want to do  that tribute band competition  a lot of these tribute bands  are crazy people  there's tribute bands  that understand  like my brother's tribute band  the U2 one  he understands  it's a money making machine  sure  he is now going around  just making money  hand over fist 
[00:35:00]  in cities all over the country  and all over the world  they got them going  all over the place  people love U2  can't get U2  you get U2 tribute band  so he makes money  other people do  these tribute bands  because they are in love  with the band  or the front person  or some member  of the band  and they think  they are this person  and that's when  it gets frightening  remember we saw  that Van Halen tribute band  when your brother  was playing  at the Hard Rock Cafe  and the guy  thought he was  David Lee Roth 
[00:35:30]  walks around  like David Lee Roth  and those are  the scary guys  where they really  think they are  the guy from the band  I found the  Journey tribute band  are you dead?  just a quick sample  of Anthony's  brother's  Journey tribute band  with Hugo singing  live recording 
[00:36:00]  that sounds like  live journey  yeah  and I was talking  to Joe  and he said  he never really  played Journey songs  before  and now he plays  it better than  the members  no he get up there  and he played them  like years ago  in another cover band  and yeah  he just picked up  the guitar  hey I remember  this dribble  that's more 
[00:36:30]  guitar  more  solo  ending  thing  yeah  how about 
[00:37:00]  open arms  do you have that one?  I'm trying to find  I don't have a list  of the songs  it's my favorite  Journey song  gotta find the hits  I know  I wanna hear  open arms  get your lighters out  people  remember this 
[00:37:30]  more guitars  alright hold on  I'm trying to get  some  open arms  is that insane?  remember that?  they have a lot of  good tunes Journey  as much as I  never liked them  growing up  like every time  you hear like  I originally loaded  my best of Journey 
[00:38:00]  on the iPod  I'm like shit  these were all  a lot of good songs  by one band  they had a lot  of hits back then  in the 80's  didn't they?  yeah but that's  where they can  still tour  they have so many  recognizable songs  I know  and there's no need  to humiliate me  I'm not humiliating  I really wasn't  alright  it really fell apart  when Randy Jackson  joined the band  yeah he did  yeah  Randy Jackson  was in the band  from American Idol  what did he play?  he looks like a  face  of course  how did I know that?  but it wasn't fat  no 
[00:38:30]  it was really skinny  and he had one of those  like a flat top  cameo  black guy hairdos  and yeah  wore a lot of  wacky 80's clothes  alright let's  be embarrassing  that qualifies him  to be a judge  in the biggest show  on television  of course  hey who's this?  Mike  hey Mike  what do you have  for the show?  I just wanted to let you know  if you look up on IMDB  there's a documentary  called Tribute  and it's about  this whole music  subculture  of these bands  that go on stage 
[00:39:00]  like Kiss Tribute fans  and Queen Tribute bands  that recreate  the entire show  and the subculture  includes guys  in these bands  who start to take  themselves way too  seriously  like they're the actual  members of the band  and there's actual  fans now  that are not fans  of the original bands  but are fans  of these Tribute bands  that go insane  it revolves around  this guy called  Superfan  who follows this  Queen Tribute band  and his entire life  revolves around  going to these  different Queen shows  Queen Tribute shows 
[00:39:30]  it's really nuts  it's not like  Anthony's brother  who's doing  successful gigs  doing more stuff  than U2  it's about guys  who are playing  these secondary  tertiary level clubs  and they're just  trying to make it  and they're not  and they're just  it's really sad  going to have to  check that out  Tribute  yeah  it's right up  on IMDb  I gotta check out  that movie as well  well it's tough  to make it as a  Tribute band  you can't do so much  I got a copy of it  and I don't know  if you guys remember  old Long Island bands 
[00:40:00]  like Sticky Fingers  and Crystal Ship  back then  they were huge  Crystal Ship  I was gonna say  I don't know  if it was Crystal Ship  but I saw  Doors Tribute band  where  with Bo Hulse  remember him  he was a big  fat Jim Morrison  the guy was this  big fat guy  named Bo Hulse  but they did  an unbelievable job  and if it was  the band I'm thinking of  they would carry  the lead singer  in from the back  of the club  on a door  like the rest  of the band  would start  whatever  some long door  song with a long  intro  and then  they're like  where's the lead singer  and all of a sudden  there's a commotion 
[00:40:30]  in the back of the club  they're carrying him  in on an actual door  on a door man  and they dump him  on stage  he kind of falls  like he's completely  hammered  and gets up  and starts singing  there was also  Jasker's Farm  and these guys  they used to play  the Capitol Theater  and sell it out  3,000 theaters  these guys would sell out  that's not what  this movie is about  this movie is about  these guys  that are at the end  of the rope  guys who were  real musicians  and again  a lot of times  these guys  original music  they can't make it  tribute bands  there's a lot of money  your brother's band  Anthony  there's a lot of money 
[00:41:00]  in current bands  like U2  and stuff like that  but some of these guys  are rehashing stuff  from 20-30 years ago  and it's just really pathetic  I like the Neil Diamond  tribute guy  you ever see these guys  and they dress like them  and come out on stage  and perform Neil Diamond songs  and there's just old people  in the audience  like they're seeing  Neil Diamond  let's go to George  hey George  hey guys  good morning  good morning  hey Anthony  I'm watching a show  I think on like 
[00:41:30]  the Learning Channel  American Casino  and they got this U2 cover band  was it your brother's band?  I don't know  I don't think so  they sold tickets  to the thing  there were like  a thousand people  it was totally  it was insane  the guy looked exactly  like Bono  and it reminded me  of that movie  Rockstar  with Wahlberg  remember that movie?  the guy who replaced  the lead singer  sounds exactly like him  that's all it takes  that's all it takes  Joe's having a great time  with the tribute band thing  so  at what point  do the main 
[00:42:00]  do the regular acts  step in  and try to collect royalties  from these bands  that are going around  making millions  off of material  they're not making millions  I've never heard of it  you know  any bands coming forward  and going  hey  what are you doing man?  well no  because you're sustaining  that company's fan base  while  let's say it's U2  U2 obviously  is out touring somewhere else  or not touring  so these tribute bands  could go on  but you're going out there  like any other band  just you know  like a cover band  but you just happen  to be doing  all the songs 
[00:42:30]  from one band  you know what I mean?  there's so many bands  out there  just doing everyone else's  there is something legal  there are performance royalties  if you're making money  doing it  you know  if you just went out there  playing for free  there'd be no problem  but the second you start  making money doing it  I think the band  can step in  that's a good question  it's never been done  I'm sure  but  you know  any band  would look like  real bad guys  sure  exactly  probably why they don't do it  trying to pilfer a few bucks  off of a cover band  here's the one example  the thing I like about a cover band  obviously you know  which one I'm going with 
[00:43:00]  I'm a sabracadabra fan  sabracadabra  but  the beautiful thing is  they played Florentine's  birthday party  and you have your  pick of song list  so you pick all the  obscure shit  that you'd never hear  the real Sabbath  and that was great  it sounded like Sabbath  so to watch  it was like watching  Sabbath do these songs  I'd never  for as long as I live  here live  that was the fun part  and they do a good job  phenomenal  he has a big  bolt in front of his pants  so he's a huge cock  legendarily  Joe  but aside from that  wait you know  the members of  sabracadabra  I know Joe  and I talked to  one of the other guys  through email and stuff 
[00:43:30]  they're really cool guys  but they played  Florentine's birthday party  Jim's a good friend  alright let's say  hi to Anthony  Anthony  yo what's up  OA  AIDS fuckface scumbag  why do you  have to use  talk like that  how you guys doing  alright Anthony  there's two bands  on Long Island  Theater of Pain  the Motley Crue  and the  Appetite for Destruction  that's the Guns and Roses  ok  Axl Rose  from  Theater of  from Appetite for Destruction  is Tommy Lee  in Theater of Pain  so these guys  just like  trade each other off  Theater of Pain sucks  but  on Appetite for Destruction 
[00:44:00]  the guy comes out  in all like the  tuxedo outfits  plays the piano  you know more or less  tries to be Axl Rose  his wig is falling off  does he sound like Axl?  sometimes  like  like the Mr. Brownstone  type sound  he's got that  but then when he  hits the high notes  he's kind of failing  but the show is good  you know  Axl  Axl  you gotta give him credit  has one of the best  rock voices ever  I mean he's just  phenomenal  and original  and I imagine  this gotta be a really  tough one to  imitate  well we got a whole 
[00:44:30]  we got a whole bin here  of tribute bands  uh oh  alright guys  I'll cut you later  bye Angel  people have been  sending in their  tribute bands  for uh  for months now  oh boy  we got a couple  of Leonard Skinner  tribute bands  do we know  what songs are on here  it's just a CD  with uh  I would assume  they would have to  put their hits on there  yeah  well  Leonard Skinner  probably Sweet Home Alabama  right  just me talking  who knows 
[00:45:00]  let's uh  what's the name of this one  Street Survivors  of course  Street Survivors  Street Survivors  is the uh  Leonard Skinner  tribute band  don't want to confuse  anybody uh  with the name  you gotta really  put it in their face  that hey  we do this kind of music  what is Street Survivors  I'm not a big  Skinner fanatic  an album  oh it's okay  uh  and their business card  says Street Survivors  Yankees by birth  Rebels by choice  maybe this is a DVD  because it's not 
[00:45:30]  uh  queuing up  the name of their band  should be  decided to stay  in the terminal  Hawk why isn't that  queuing up  get to work on that  come on now  oh god  that's a DVD  alright  a DVD  yeah if you're gonna  send in your tribute  band stuff  help us out  just mark it  that's recording  yeah 
[00:46:00]  that sounds like  a tribute band  sounds like just  any band doing  this cover song  yeah  I don't think  they worked very hard  Rerun did a better job  recording the Doobie Brothers  the little tape recorder  under his jacket  why the hell  would he want  a bootleg copy 
[00:46:30]  of the Doobie Brothers  just the way  this fatso is  jumping around  that big heavy  recorder  and the whole band  stops  and it's the guy  who plays Sweet Daddy  in Good Times  I'm going to jail  for a fat kid  eating popcorn  don't you're  our friend Rerun  what a great copy  they would have gotten  let's say hi to Jim  Jim what's up  hey what's happening  on eh  well here  get  hello  give me another one  please  something that  Jim  Jim you're on  the Opie and Anthony  show  hi Jim  hi  can you hear me  yes  go ahead Jim 
[00:47:00]  alright very good  hey Sabra Kadabra  weren't they the band  with the guy  who used to dress up  like Ozzy  and act like him  and put on  a fake accent  he does it on stage  he's like an Ozzy  from the 70's  but I don't know  if he does it  in real life  I mean  they used to play  at the railroad  station bar  across the street  from the rock  concomit station  oh ok  they were pretty much  the epitome  of the weirdo  in the tribute band  who thought he was  the guy  I mean they kicked ass 
[00:47:30]  they sounded great  but that guy  wasn't he  just a little too far  I don't know actually  I only saw him  under those circumstances  where you're supposed  to be like him  I mean he was a cool guy  though walking around  just talking  he didn't seem in character  when we were hanging out  I mean he was just  pretty normal  which was really weird  he kept dressed like  Ozzy in 1976  let me decide for that  yeah I was just shocked  by how much he tried  he was like trying  to be the man  it was kind of strange  the whole tribute band  was kind of freaky  but yeah they kicked ass  that drummer was outstanding  yeah they're a very good band  alright 
[00:48:00]  alright I got nothing  punch out  you have a lot sir  don't think that  what about yourself  let's say hi to Nate  in Brooklyn  Nate what's up  good morning guys  there used to be this band  in the New York area  called the Soft Parade  they were a Doors cover band  and the guy  I don't remember his name  but the Jim Morrison guy  would get so wrapped up  into the character  he would actually start  reading those lines  that were popularized  by Oliver Stone  at the actual show  and he would pretend  that there were cops  in the back of the room  coming to arrest him  and he would start going 
[00:48:30]  no no no  come on man  this is my freedom  leave me alone  there were no cops  what a dick  and actually  there was this other one  called the Voodoo Child  a Hendrix guy  he would actually burn  his guitar  and one time  at this place  in Staten Island  his boa actually  caught fire  his boa  the feather boa  that he was wearing  around  he  actually caught fire  and the manager  had to come out  with a fire extinguisher  and put him out  that's pretty wild  and reveled  type of guy  that's classic  take it here guys  alright thank you Nate 
[00:49:00]  alright we found  another tribute band  Anthony  the band's called  Exciter  Exciter  the Judas Priest  tribute band  of course  ready to make it realistic  the singer  sucks a cock  right there on stage  is that true  alright  it's your time  to sing with me  I know you know  this one  uh oh  oh boy  uh oh

[01:00:00]  year  what?  good  I wrote it this young time  For the reason I'll try  Tries to understand it  I swear to my home  I say it's cold  Down in the children's land  They did grow  And I need that  Something's wrong  Don't call me, darling  Nothing real 
[01:00:30]  That doesn't fit any better  Not bad at all. There you go. No code from Jersey.  They passed the audition.  I'm trying to move on.  I try on a daily basis  to move the fuck on.  Oh, that was a good one.  Yeah, but a bit has been created, though.  The listeners will take off on this one. 
[01:01:00]  We'll see how long this goes  before they ruin it.  Anthony on Long Island.  Go ahead, Anthony.  Yo, what's up?  Speaking of black tribute bands,  there's a Guns N' Roses band  from down south  called Rocket Queen.  The singer was black  and they called himself  Black Soul Rose.  Really?  Yeah, he wasn't too good,  but it's funny  to see a black guy with red hair.  It's true.  Later, guys.  All right, well,  that's not what I was going for,  but there you have it.  Ben, oh, look at this.  Dave in Boston.  Go ahead, Dave.  Uh-oh.  Hey.  Hey, Dave. 
[01:01:30]  Hey, uh,  I heard Ben's cock  had its own tribute band.  Did it?  The thing is,  Ben's hog is so big,  it has its own tribute band.  You ass.  You gotta follow the formula.  This dummy.  Ben's cock got a tribute band.  And he clears his throat  and hangs up clumsily.  Ahem, hits a tree.  Paul in Ohio.  Yo, man, how you doing?  I'm sure you guys heard of these guys.  They're called The Machine.  They're a Pink Floyd tribute band.  Yeah.  Yeah, I saw them 
[01:02:00]  at the Westbury Theater.  I'm actually from Long Island.  I'm heading home.  At the Westbury Music Theater,  they did the...  All right, all righty.  Hurry up.  I'm sorry, dude.  Yeah, they did  The Dark Side of the Moon  to Wizard of Oz,  and it actually works.  Yeah, we've heard  that old gag.  All right.  No, dude,  it actually works.  Yeah, but what if I'm...  You start Dark Side of the Moon, man,  right on the second roar  of the MGM Lion  during The Wizard of Oz,  and you'll be surprised  if you turn the volume down 
[01:02:30]  on The Wizard of Oz,  how it lines up, man,  and how the music goes  with the movie, man.  All right, here we go.  Take acid,  and anything goes  with that stupid movie.  And junkies.  There's a million examples  of that, by the way.  Things that go with the film  if you turn it down.  Yeah, yeah.  You could put a song on  and turn the TV on  and turn the volume  on the TV down,  and occasionally,  especially when you're  smoking pot with your friends,  the mouth looks like  it's singing the song.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, I've done that.  You know what lines up great  when she lands in Munchkinville  if you turn the volume down  and then you play short people  got no reason to live. 
[01:03:00]  That lines up well.  All right, moving on.  We're doing this tribute band thing.  Eventually, we're going to have  some kind of contest.  So far, we like two bands,  Sabra Cadabra  and No Code by Pearl Jam, right?  All right, I get it.  Jesus Christ.  Here's a band called Hair.  Ace Free Me.  Wow. 
[01:03:30]  All right.  Here's a band called Hair Supply.  Hair Supply?  Hair Supply.  What do they do?  The greatest heavy metal  air supply tribute band  in the Tri-State Air.  Heavy metal air supply.  See, this isn't tribute.  This is a joke.  And that's also the company  that Lou Graham has been calling. 
[01:04:00]  That's good.  New York City!  Brewer?  I'm all out of love.  I'm so lost without you.  I know you were right.  And you've been for so long.  I'm all out of love.  Well, then I'm without you.  I can't be too late  to say that I was so wrong.  I'm all out of love. 
[01:04:30]  I'm all out of love.  Oh, I'm all out of love.  I'm all out of love.  I'm all out of love.  I'm all out of love.  Oh, that's awful.  All right, well, there you go.  There's a...  What are you guys laughing at?  I can't even read it.  What are you laughing at?  I can't read it.  Can you see this one?  I didn't see it.  Just read it.  I can't. 
[01:05:00]  Why?  No, it's too bad.  You can't.  I can't read it.  Well, let me see it.  It's just over the line.  Let me see it.  It's from a listener.  I'll post it on Blackpack when I get home.  It's from a listener and it's satellite radio.  Nah, it's just you can't.  Awful.  Oh, my God.  You motherfuckers.  That's Matt from Staten Island.  The big racist.  Well, we can play fill-in-the-blank.  Matt from Staten Island,  an all-black Beatles tribute band called... 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  And it just happens to be the name of another band  that was popular.  Say, hey, what are we doing next?  Let's go to Mike in Westchester.  Mike.  Hey, guys.  Oh.  Yeah.  Just trying to be friendly.  I saw a black Pink Floyd tribute band  just last week.  They were called Dark East Side of the Moon.  Okay.  All right.  Look.  It always goes too far.  It always goes too far.  What are we moving on with here?  This show has gotten incredibly racist 
[01:06:00]  over the past couple of days  and it's got to stop.  Yes.  Come on now.  Hey, hey.  All right.  We've got to get back to goofing on the Asians.  The world's ultimate Rush tribute trio.  What are they called, though?  Wow.  Momo's Dance Party?  That's the name of the...  What, the Rush?  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  What?  There's a black Rush tribute?  Yeah.  Singers, Getty Leroy. 
[01:06:30]  Well, the name isn't Rush.  It's Take Your Time and Get There Late.  Jesus.  There it goes.  Two more black listeners.  What?  Look, we're sorry.  Waddledoodle.  I apologize.  I've been very sensitive to their plight.  The black listeners have been emailing saying,  come on, guys.  We love the black listeners.  We just lost two more.  All right.  Here's Momo's Dance Party. 
[01:07:00]  Left a few notes out there.  Yeah.  Left a few notes out.  Rush, very hard to sing, too, by the way. 
[01:07:30]  Let's begin the day with a friendly voice.  Let's go past the love, love, truth, feel.  Place that's all right, so we do.  Never the time to use it, but you can't take your home.  Not bad.  A little thin.  Yeah.  I'm running away in the open, frozen. 
[01:08:00]  Magic got your finger.  For the spirit of a leader,  the magic of a leader.  Then he reads a tough one.  Yeah.  He's got the notes, but he doesn't have, like,  it's a little two nasal.  He doesn't have the power that Kenny does get the notes with.  He's not pushing the wind.  Yeah.  Not bad, though.  It's all right. 
[01:08:30]  Momo's Dance Party.  It's all right, dog.  You want it in the good bin or the, uh...  Yeah.  We'll keep them for a while?  Yeah.  All right.  They're in contention.  We'll put them with, uh, Sabra Cadabra and No Code.  Who is this, Opie?  More of, uh, Black Sabbath.  Classic Black Sabbath.  Wicked World.  Wicked World.  A fine song.  Mmm. 
[01:09:00]  Find a hit.  Yeah, they went kind of obscure.  What songs are they?  Yeah.  I can't even look at the phones.  Are they in feedback?  Look at blind...  What is that?  Eight or something?  No, don't go to Anthony in California.  Anthony.  Yeah.  What's up?  No.  Hey, guys.  How you doing there, sweet cheeks?  No, Anthony.  No, I refuse to be part of this phone call.  Which one?  What's up, Anthony?  I've seen a black group one time do Twisted Sister. 
[01:09:30]  They called themselves Twisted Nick.  Yeah, see, they always ruin it.  Let's go to Vinny.  Vinny.  What are you saying?  Hello?  Hey.  Yeah, hey.  It's a Billy Idol tribute band, all black.  Moly Moly.  What?  That's not even funny.  It's not...  You got...  All right, Wicked World.  What songs are on there, Hope?  I'll help you.  Killing Yourself to Live, Behind the Wall of Sleep, Hole in the Sky, Tomorrow's Dream, and  This Little Ditty.  Oh, I'm going to do Hole in the Sky. 
[01:10:00]  Fairy Swear Poops.  How long does it take for the vocals to kick in here?  Yeah, I would do it with Hole in the Sky, but that's just me.  I want as many people to play along, though.  A lot of people don't know Hole in the Sky.  I know.  It's so long in trouble.  These guys are from Yonkers. 
[01:10:30]  Yonkers.  Pretty good, right?  Yeah.  This goes on and on, doesn't it? 
[01:11:00]  It's a long intro, man.  Yeah.  I know, I know.  1970.  There we go.  There we go.  So it's all the things that night. 
[01:11:30]  Suddenly, I got a right.  He's not a bad singer, but he doesn't really sound like Ozzy.  No, he's not capturing the Ozzy. 
[01:12:00]  Right, but he's not a bad voice.  Yeah.  Yay or nay?  I'm an offense on that one.  I'd have to put it in the nay if I had to choose one, but they don't suck.  Are they better than Sabra Kedabra?  No.  Then they gotta go.  Then they gotta go.  They gotta go.  They gotta go.  I'm not gonna say what they have for a Primus tribute.  Wow.  But it is simple. 
[01:12:30]  You can only imagine who the lead singer of the Spanish Rolling Stones is.  Jesus.  Ah, you people.  My God.  Is there a song list on this one?  No?  No, they didn't sing it.  Oh, boy.  Okay, we got a Van Halen tribute band.  The mighty Van Halen tribute.  Unchained.  Another band from Jersey, Anthony. 
[01:13:00]  Mm-hmm.  I've heard these guys.  Aren't these...  I think these are the guys that were at the Hard Rock that night.  Yeah, that's exactly who it is.  Yeah.  This next band.  I used to have posters on my wall of these next guys when I was in high school.  And now I'm sharing the stage with them.  Ladies and gentlemen, the greatest Van Halen tribute band in the world.  Oh, boy.  There he is.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Wow.  What an intro. 
[01:13:30]  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  If you're going to showcase your ability as a tribute band, 
[01:14:00]  why would you send in a live recording where the vocals are so buried?  Yeah, wouldn't you get a good studio recording of yourself?  That's got to go in the nay thing, but can they send us another one?  Maybe they're better than that, because that's horrendously recorded.  Yeah, you can kind of tell it's probably good.  Send us another one. 
[01:14:30]  Jammer, what's up?  Hey, old fan.  Hey.  Big lip lover.  Hi, fella.  You guys here's Steve Miller's tribute band, the old black one.  Huh?  Jungle lovers.  What?  All right, listeners, you've done enough damage.  You don't have to be vicious.  You can be clever.  Ian from Philly, did you guys see the all-Asian tribute band for Pink Floyd?  Blank Floyd. 
[01:15:00]  Jesus.  Oh, no.  She from New York has a soft-sell tribute.  Sickles.  Steve.  Jesus.  It's just awful.  You guys are horrid.  There's no reason for this.  I think people are all, like, pissed off from yesterday, from watching that fire extinguisher 
[01:15:30]  hit the guy in the face at the convenience store.  And now they're trying to get back.  Now they're just dicks.  Are they?  Ah, please.  They're just being dicks.  Oh, what's this?  ACDC.  Right?  Obviously.  Overdose.  The Bond Scotch tribute.  See me right out of the sunset. 
[01:16:00]  Oh, no.  Cause I keep a stream.  Straight, man.  After all that I've been dead, if you know what I mean.  Women to the left of me.  Women to the right.  Ain't got no gun. 
[01:16:30]  Ain't got no knife.  Don't you stop the fire.  Cause I'm too late.  I'm dynamite.  Good.  Along with the fight.  Not bad.  Not bad, huh?  Yeah.  Alright, we'll put these guys in that other pile.  Very good.  Is that, are you laughing at Randall from Austin, Texas?  Oh, I haven't seen that one yet.  I'm looking at Rob from West Palm Beach. 
[01:17:00]  One black tribute band you'll never see is a tribute to the police.  I like this guy with an all Hasidic band doing the moody Jews.  See, that's the bit.  You gotta roll it around a little bit.  Oh, yeah.  Let me sort through all the different nationalities that are coming in.  Rich in New York.  Go ahead, Rich.  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Hey.  Nickelback has an all black tribute band. 
[01:17:30]  All right.  I'm sure they do.  I'm sure they do.  Thank you.  I'm sure they're wonderful.  Nickelback.  Carmine from Staten Island.  Yeah, I want to make a correction.  I saw that black pink Floyd band.  They were actually called, if I remember correctly, it was the dark side of the coon.  Oh, God.  Oops.  You know, I...  Enough.  Enough of the black tribute band bit.  They're only following your leads.  They're not following our leads. 
[01:18:00]  They're following you and you.  I read one.  And you.  I read one off of instant feedback.  And now it always, again, they take it much too far.  Brad and Cleveland.  Oh, God.  Hey, buddy.  Hey, we have the world's first Men at Work tribute band here.  They happen to be black.  Called Men That Don't Work.  All right.  See, now he's rehashing old bits.  No.  Mr. Monster Rain Hughes from Whack Bag.  There is no way in hell that will ever be read.  It's probably the most defensive one I've ever seen. 
[01:18:30]  What's the name of the band or what band are they paying tribute to?  It's a Nirvana tribute band.  And it's the worst.  No.  Look at this one, Jimmy.  See, it's gone way too far.  The hate that comes out of some of you people.  Not even clever or funny in a horrific way.  Oh, my God.  Huh?  Nothing.  Oh.  Oh, you read that one? 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Really bad.  We got any others to look at today?  Foo Fighters, Beatles, Iron Maiden.  Beatles.  We got to hear the Beatles.  Drop something.  Ian's mad at me in Philly.  Hey, Ope, thanks for fucking up my line, fuckface.  What was the line?  I don't remember now.  Did I mess it up, Ian?  Ian, what happened?  Yeah, Ian.  There's some feedback with your line.  I guess there's a tribute band out there of all kids that are mongoloids.  System of the Downs. 
[01:19:30]  All right.  Here we go.  Believe me, I'm picking anyone I can find that is a little different.  She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah.  She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah.  She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh.  You think you've lost your love.  Oh.  Well, I saw her yesterday. 
[01:20:00]  Beatles, very hard to do right.  Everyone is so familiar with it.  She told me what to say.  She said she loves you.  Yeah, but it's such an imitation of, like, the English accent and stuff.  She loves you.  Oh.  And you know you should be glad.  Oh.  They forgot the high note.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  She almost lost her mind.  Oh.  Oh.  But now she said she knows.  I say, I think they've got to go in the yay thing, though, just to see them live. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  Bold puddin' head on rhythm guitar.  Copies of Catcher in the Rye will be handed out at the door.  Shake it up, baby.  Shake it up, baby.  Twist that shout.  Twist that shout.  Oh.  Too whiny or something.  Come on, baby.  Come on and work it on out.  Work it on out.  Yeah. 
[01:21:00]  Work it on out.  Ah.  The harmonies are all wrong.  Yeah, really bad.  Ouch.  I haven't been too many.  That was the BBC, a tribute to the Beatles.  No.  Okay, that's no.  Yeah.  The BBC.  The love bug.  The BBC.  Have fun, listeners.  Oh, yeah, the love bug.  Is that Michael Keaton?  Yes.  He's in that movie?  He hasn't done anything in years.  What happened to Michael Keaton? 
[01:21:30]  He did Batman and then...  The white noise was awful.  What did...  No.  What did he do?  Since, uh...  What was his last good movie?  Mr. Monst?  Pacific Heights?  Yeah, that was a good movie.  When did he...  This is Sanctuary.  I'm made enough for tribute band.  What? 
[01:22:00]  What?  There is no peace  It's falling apart  We're falling well  All our faiths come on  Every day  We trust you free  All the way  We can't believe 
[01:22:30]  We're going through the  Sons of the way  Can't be far away  Too fast  That sounds pretty good  Yeah  It's not 
[01:23:00]  Lousy recording  All right  Well there you have it  Build up was a little slow  But that was pretty good  That's sanctuary  Vocals were there  But it's a lousy recording  Another lousy recording  Yeah  Okay  Let's say how to Peggy  In Illinois  Peggy what's up  Hey  Hey  I was just calling  To tell Jim  That girls can sing  Guys songs  I sing in a band  And we do a bunch of covers  I'm not in a tribute band

[01:25:30]  Who's this?  Monkey Wrench  Foo Fighters  Tribute Band  Where's My Hero?  This isn't My Hero  No  It's mislabeled probably  Let's see if it's this track  Play a hit  How about Total Eclipse of the Heart? 
[01:26:00]  Here's My Hero  Monkey Wrench  Alright  Alright  Thank you. 
[01:26:30]  Thank you. 
[01:27:00]  Eh.  Something like a cumber band.  Yeah.  What is it?  Kind of was able to get the effect on the vocals to try to fake it, but it didn't really sound  like him.  Oh, my God.  An Alice in Chains tribute band?  This will be the last one we do today.  Ah.  One of my faves.  One of my faves.  Yes.  That would be good.  Alice in Chains tribute band from Boston.  What's the name of these guys?  Junkhead?  Junkhead, Anthony.  Doing Alice in Chains.  Play a good one. 
[01:27:30]  They only have like one or two songs on here.  A little wood?  Sure.  Sure.  Musically very good.  So far, so good.  So be broken by my master. 
[01:28:00]  She's the young child of love thereafter.  You really lost it there. 
[01:28:30]  Starts off good.  You lost me.  It doesn't have the power.  Laying hat.  Drowning in reaper, too.  Yeah.  Yeah, they try to cover up with all kinds of reverb and chorus and everything else on  their vocals, and it's just, it ain't doing it.  Let's start off promising, but... 
[01:29:00]  Lane's voice, one of the best singers in rock history, I would say.  History.  The more reverb...  That was great.  Lane Staley.  Lane Staley was amazing.  The power he had in range.  Mike in Cleveland.  What's up, Mike?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, you guys are going to guess this one right away.  The Black Nine Inch Nails tribute band.  With that nine-inch cock.  I don't know.  The Black Man doesn't...  But the Black Man doesn't mind that stereotype. 
[01:29:30]  Jesus.  Let's say hi to Bill in Tennessee.  Bill, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, Tasty Dixie does covers of ACDC, Kiss, and the Cars.  And it's interesting, to say the least.  Tasty Dixie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Didn't we have him on the show once?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hillbilly tribute to ACDC.  We like these guys, actually.  Yeah, they're pretty cool.  Maybe we'll go to break with one of their songs. 
[01:30:00]  Doesn't sound like the band.  They do their own thing with the songs.  Yeah.  Doing a little fiddling and bluegrassing.  Fiddling.  All right, thanks.  All right, thanks.  You guys want to hear Highway to Hell, You Shook Me All Night Long, or Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Sheep?  Dirty Deeds.  Yeah?  Yeah, I like Dirty Deeds.  All right, Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Sheep as we go to break from Hay Seed Dixie.  You're having trouble with your high school hair.

Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah. 
[01:33:30]  Wow, turn that down a bit.  Thanks, bro.  It's your pals, Opie and Anthony.  Little Jimmy Norton is somewhere.  I think he's doing like a phone interview.  He's playing down there in D.C. this weekend.  Wait, he's doing some other show right now?  I think so.  Is it now or a little later?  Oh, no, here he comes.  He's got to do a phoner. 
[01:34:00]  He should do it on our show.  He's got to do a phoner for The Arrow.  Yeah, at 9.30 I'm doing that.  9.30, The Arrow down in D.C.?  Yeah.  All right.  They were kind enough to have you on their program?  Yeah, those guys have been very, very cool,  and so has those guys out to lunch have been helped promoting the D.C. show,  which is great since, you know, I made fun of Elliot's laugh and can't get on his show.  And Ron and Fez.  Ron and Fez have been phenomenal.  I love those guys.  Yeah.  Yeah, which will be, well, never mind.  Anyway.  Hi, Jim.  Fez.  Fez.  It's going to be a huge show down there in D.C. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah, it was sold out, but then we added some seats.  We had to reconfigure only because the Leno thing kind of sold things out a little faster  than I expected, so they reconfigured it and added seats and whatever.  People said, he's a funny lad.  This guy's not too bad.  Where's he playing?  Yeah, so hopefully it'll be good.  Not too shabby to have Leno promoting your gigs instead of...  It definitely helped.  Well, again, it's on TV, man.  It's just people just tune in.  They hear it accidentally.  It also helps us because you haven't really had to promote that show.  Yeah.  So we don't have to sit through your shameless plugs.  Oh, they really are awful. 
[01:35:00]  Dude, please.  Shameless.  The fact that I'm doing Cleveland in July is completely irrelevant to anything.  Who cares?  All right, all right, Dwayne.  Dude, no one cares if tickets go on sale this Friday morning at 10.  Big deal.  Ticket master.  Who gives a shit?  Dwayne, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Hey, Dwayne.  Hey, Jimmy.  Hey, Dwayne.  Hey, just calling in support of the black listeners.  See, we take it cool.  We understand it's all jokes and games.  Because see, it's all made up of one quick Menino.  Speaks volumes. 
[01:35:30]  What's that?  That's true.  What happened?  It's all made up with one quick Menino.  One quick Menino?  And it erases everything.  See?  What do you mean?  Here's one Menino, and it makes up for everything that we do that might be seen as offensive.  Dwayne, you're black?  Yes, sir.  Yeah, but how black are you?  How black am I?  Yeah.  I'm so black that I have to smile at night.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  That's the black.  We actually did have more black listeners.  I mean, I guess sometimes we do racist jokes.  You guys would be amazed how many people. 
[01:36:00]  I'm down here in Jersey.  You'd be amazed how many black guys listen to you.  All right.  Trust us, we sit there and listen to you guys every day.  I've been surprised how many times black guys come up.  It's like you think for some reason, because there's only white guys in the studio, you think  that no one else listens.  And then I'd be surprised how many guys come up at the cellar or other places and go,  hey, man, I love the new show.  And it's like, wow, it's cool.  We've gone to see Norton a couple times.  I ran into Norton at Rascal's there in Eaton Town before they shut it down.  Yeah, it's a shame that club went.  Okay.  Bye, mister.  Thank you, Dwayne.  All right.  Take care, fellas.  There you go.  That's promising.  Hey, hey, hey.  Really fast before we move on. 
[01:36:30]  There is two more bands we've got to get to.  I wish we found these in the bin before, because we were going with a lot of kind of more obscure  bands, like Iron Maiden.  No, Rush Ope.  We have Pink Floyd and Zeppelin.  You've got to listen to some Pink Floyd tribute and a Zeppelin tribute before we move on.  All right?  Let's give them a quick answer.  Hey, I have a question about the Zeppelin tribute.  Do they do the Immigrant Song at all?  Huh?  The Immigrant Song is on there?  Yeah.  That's a great one to test vocals on.  You know, Zeppelin is, I don't know, that's one band.  That's got to be one of the toughest bands to do. 
[01:37:00]  Absolutely.  That's hard.  So when I met Robert Plant, we talked about that.  It was just kind of...  Yeah?  You and Bobby Plant?  Yeah.  He said, your head's so small.  We just took a picture.  With this giant head.  This band is called Which One's Pink?  Mm-hmm.  Zeppelin?  No.  Well, all right.  Shut up.  All right.  Want to hear Us and Them, even though that's a long intro?  Uh-oh.  There's not a lot of hits here, though.  What else is not a lot of hits?  When the Tigers Broke Free?  No.  Okay.  What Shall We Do Now?  No.  Because I'm seeing a huge amount of songs there. 
[01:37:30]  In the Flesh?  No.  The Thin Ice?  Goodbye, Blue Sky?  One of My Turns, Don't Leave Me Now, Another Brick in the Wall, but it's Part 3.  Oh, boy.  What's Part 3?  That was like a...  It's after 1 and 2.  Oh, Jesus.  And before 4, you're correct.  Yeah.  And it's only like a minute long.  The Trial.  What the hell are these guys doing?  How about Wish You Were Here?  Right.  Well, these are all, you know, great, you know, Floyd songs.  Comfortably numb.  Dude, one of the best songs ever written by anybody.  Something.  Might have to go with Us and Them, I think. 
[01:38:00]  All right.  This band is stupid.  Dude, Us and Them, Any Color You Like, Rain Damage, Eclipse, One of These Days.  We don't play the hits everyone wants to hear.  How about Comfortably Numb, Ops?  They don't have Comfortably Numb on there?  Yeah.  This is Us and Them.  Yeah.  I don't think the intro's that long, actually.  No Comfortably Numb, huh?  Which one's pink?  Shut up.  Oh, a little spray for Jimmy. 
[01:38:30]  So far, so good.  Actually, really good musically.  Come on.  Hello, hello.  Is there anybody in there?  Okay.  I looked around the room like, oh, it was Jimmy.  Okay.  Holy crap, you just got us all.  I was looking around the room going, wait a minute. 
[01:39:00]  Someone's got to be singing that.  Who's singing that?  That can't be the band.  That's funny.  Fooled me.  Totally fooled me.  I should be in a Pink Floyd tribute band.  I was like, these guys are awful.  Oh, I thought you were going to say it sounded just like the record.  Hello, hello.  That's right.  Pink skin.  That's the name of it.  My baboon-like torso.  That was funny, because you totally got me.  You got both of us.  It's a new tribute band.  Me and I?  Oh, his name is Lloyd.  I was going to say the bartender of Lloyd.  Lloyd. 
[01:39:30]  Orgently.  You know, we looked at each other like, what?  This stinks.  I don't know the jokes over, so I try it again.  Hello.  All right.  All right.  All right. 
[01:40:00]  Now I see why they picked the long intros.  Oh.  We're all free, holding every day.  Yeah.  I like Jimmy's version better.  This guy can't stay on key.  No.  Oh, he's lost. 
[01:40:30]  And?  And?  And you.  Oh, you.  You.  Fast forward to Time to Change.  I want to hear that.  Which one is pink?  Not them.  Hey.  I don't want to give up on these guys yet.  Let's just listen to this really fast.  Sounds just like a crowd.  That's great.  Yeah.  Tribute crowd. 
[01:41:00]  Run around with mullets.  I don't need no arms around me  I don't need no drugs to call me  But I need singing lessons  I have seen the writing on the wall 
[01:41:30]  You should see the writing on the wall  Jimmy, what's up?  Go to a trade school  Hey Jimmy  What's up, good morning guys  Try it out in the flesh  You'll know the song when you hear it  That's a good song  Why, you know the band?  No, I don't know the band  I know the song  Let's see how bad they fucked that one up  Well, we can do that I guess  Alright, we'll end with in the flesh here  By which one's pink?  Are you ready?  Of course I'm ready  Please welcome  Which one's pink? 
[01:42:00]  Ooh  Musically, they got it down  Yes  Yeah, they gotta get rid of that singer  Someone who sounds more like Roger Waters  I mean, Joey Diaz  Wings in the mix  Not even crickets 
[01:42:30]  Nothing  Not an acknowledgement of a person for  I was reading, Jimmy  Sorry  You missed nothing  Oh, brother  Another one that goes on forever, huh?  I hate this band  Yeah, they're annoying me  The fact they don't put one song on there  That anybody knows  Well 
[01:43:00]  Let's hear it  Coming now?  No  Another time around  The band is good  The music is good  Ah  Dang  Not bad  To feel the warm 
[01:43:30]  Thriller  Confusion  That space could take love  Tell me  Is something  In the mood  In your sunshine  Is this not what  You expected to see  If you want to find out  What behind these  It's lackluster  We gotta make a decision  They're out?  I say out  Their music's good  But man  By the way  If you guys know of any other  Tribute bands out there 
[01:44:00]  It's time for them to start  Sending their stuff in again  Nick Q from Boston  Hi, I'm Anthony  I think that anyone  Who likes music  That wasn't a radio hit  Is just trying to be cool  It's impossible  For the lesser known tracks  To be better than the hits  I'm a close-minded idiot  Alright, Nick  Thank you  Thank you for that  I agree with him now, man  I just assume  That if you're a tribute band, Nick  Nick  If you're a tribute band  You  And you're going to see  A tribute band 
[01:44:30]  Of Pink Floyd  Or any band  You are going  For the sheer purpose  Of seeing  Them play  The hit songs  The hit songs  The songs you remember hearing  Jack off  And Nick  The problem is  I understand what you're saying  About wanting to hear  Obscure songs  But when they send in a CD  With only obscure songs  Right  That's irritating  Yeah, one band  Sent in  The Iron Maiden tribute band  They don't have  Run to the Hills  They had 
[01:45:00]  Number of the Beast  If you want to put  Some songs on  That are a little out there  Because you're a huge  Tribute band fan  Fine  The one Black Sabbath  Tribute band  And I couldn't even find  A hit off the CD  Those songs are self-serving  For the band  No, that was the  That was  Oh, Sabba Cadabba  You mean the other one  Wicked World  Okay  Yeah  Self-serving for the band  Yeah  If they're huge fans  And they love  Like the deep tracks  Off of it  And they love doing it  You're upstairs  On stage  Enjoying playing that song  And the crowd  Is sitting there  Staring at you  Going  What the fuck is this  Nick Q 
[01:45:30]  Indeed  Alright, here we go  This is the final one  For today  Who says his name  Is Anthony  No, he's writing  And making it like  It's me  Yeah  Says, hi, I'm Anthony  Can someone ask  Lance from Apocalypse Now  Why he brought me  An ice beverage  Lance  Yeah, we didn't ask  For ice beverages  We certainly didn't  Oh, boy  That's why I was confused  If that kid wasn't so tussleable  I'd be angry  Did he screw up again?  That's it  I drink these sometimes  So I can see  Yeah, I'll be fine  He screwed up again  Alright, here we go  Cashmere  The music of Led Zeppelin 
[01:46:00]  No ice  No ice there  What happened?  Jimmy has a problem with you  Alright, last time  You asked me for that  No  So I heard  Mate  So that's what I got  I didn't say  Latte coffee  It's fine  I don't know why  Eric brought you in  It's not a big deal  Sorry  That's fine  I got scared  You got scared  That's funny  Beat it  Small sweater  Jesus  Fucking sweater dicky  Is irritating me  If you wear a sweater  At least let it come to your belt  Fucking dryer idiot  This is one of those shows 
[01:46:30]  Where we're just going to  Goof off all morning  I can feel it already  Why not?  Which is nonsense  Alright, when you do a talk show every day  You're going to have these days  Where you just want to screw off  Off the subject one  Why don't we take the show outside?  Why don't we just do the rest of the show from the sidewalk?  So I'm coming home last night  And I honestly looked into a car next to me  And there was a guy who had this serious unit  And we've been joking about it 
[01:47:00]  The fucking thing was huge  I tried to get a picture of it  But the guy drove away before I could snap it  Yeah  It was monstrous  It's hysterical  You pull outside a vehicle  And see that serious unit up on someone's dashboard  It's awful  It is so big  It just obscures your view as you're driving  Dude, I saw it from another car at night  Yeah  I was on the West Side Highway  There's a guy and a chick  What draws my attention is not the chick  But that fucking NASA thing on the dashboard  I almost got a picture of it  I think it would be funny  The glow in the inside of their car coming off the thing  No, it was actually off 
[01:47:30]  I finally got rid of mine  Because, you know, the fine folks at the little doggy company  You know, when they wanted us so bad  That they gave Ant and I free subscriptions there  Yep  Well, they finally got rid of my free subscription  They canceled the subscription  Which just ran out, probably, right?  I guess  Well, I didn't even check  I finally decided to check it  So they turned it off  Who knows?  They could have turned it off six months ago  So I had to finally remove this huge unit from my dashboard  Messed up my whole fucking car  There's screw holes in your dashboard now, right?  Well, they glued it  They had to glue a metal plate 
[01:48:00]  Great  On my dashboard  And then the unit sat up from there  I had to get  A hat  Big hats  Like I had to get a sombrero  To cover this thing  Sombrero  That was my security  So, you know, somebody doesn't break into the car  Thinking it's something really cool  Yeah  So I had a huge, like, sombrero type hat  Covering the damn thing  So I finally ripped the whole thing out  My car is so fucked  Yeah, you need something new  They glued it with this  Whatever glue they use  And the metal plate on the dashboard 
[01:48:30]  It was sitting up high with this big screwy thing  Yeah, they screwed two big screws  Into the plastic console  Of my Pathfinder  Oh  Just screw  I don't want screws in  Screws  All right  Cashmere, the music of Led Zeppelin  The Immigrant Song  This is very brave to attempt  This, yes  I like it  Uh-oh, hold on  I apparently hurt himself 
[01:49:00]  Oh  Come on, come on, come on  I'm from the light  Of the ice and snow  Midnight show  For the hot springs to go  Hammer of the gust  We'll drive our ship  To a new end  Double vocals  Punch it up a little bit  A little slow, too, right? 
[01:49:30]  Yeah  Yeah  You're right, it doubles  Which means live it would be even worse  Wow  It's not the worst, Zeppelin, I've heard  In the sunshine 
[01:50:00]  Nothing in the rain  Killing on the moonshine  Rockin' through the rain  Got no time to back my back  I'm just locked out the door 
[01:50:30]  I gotta fade, I can't be late  For the high I'm gonna go  It's like Kip Winger singing Zeppelin or something.  I was going to say, it sounds like an 80s hairband, right?  Yeah.  Alright, well, that's a no, too.  There you go.  Send in your tribute bands.  We'll do this again down the road.  And eventually we'll get some kind of competition going.  Yeah, we want to go somewhere and have them play live  and do that whole thing.  Maybe a venue, but it will be hard to set up all those bands. 
[01:51:00]  Like all those drums and guitars.  I don't know why I had to specify what a band consists of.  They know how to do that.  We'll figure something out.  I'm scared.  Oh, I just missed this accident this morning.  Here's the wreck of the day.  Wow.  It's the Long Island Expressway.  Looks like a van was going toward the city, going westbound,  and it hit the divider, jumped right over it,  and smashed into a tractor trailer in the eastbound lane. 
[01:51:30]  Is he dead, the guy?  Yikes.  I don't know.  They took three people out of it.  The van was just destroyed.  Three people out of the van.  Alive or dead?  I just took them out.  I don't know.  What was I with them?  What do you want from me?  I thought maybe you talked to them.  That's all I heard.  But I got in and saw that on the traffic report.  I was like, whew, just missed it.  Because I get stuck behind that traffic.  You're doing the show.  It's the Opie, Jimmy, and Anthony on the phone, really pissed off show.  That would be a great show, though.  Do you have any of your navigation systems? 
[01:52:00]  Pugs have this navigation system where you're driving,  and it has a map of where you are now.  It's phenomenal.  Yeah, I got that.  It just kind of pops up.  Here's a little infinity.  It's a whole thing.  It's a screen on my dash, and it's a map of the whole area.  You can zoom in, zoom out.  It shows where you are.  It shows what road you're on.  I use it all the time, even if I'm not doing one of the navigation things that I program in.  If I see traffic coming up, I look at the map.  I see I can make a right here and go around this whole thing.  And then you follow that map around. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah, it's great.  It's the future, Jimmy.  You ought to get one of those.  Saturn doesn't have that?  Not in the model I have.  I mean, they do, actually.  It's like a fold-up map.  And they say, open this and look.  Doesn't point out where you are or anything on there?  Well, there was a Shortcuts book I had, which is so obsolete now, years ago, by that Trafficked Sam guy.  Who was he?  He quoted the phrase Gridlock.  Oh, really?  Gridlock Sam, his name is.  He did traffic for someone.  In the newspaper, right?  Yeah, but he had a book called Shortcuts that I actually used and saved myself a lot of time many times. 
[01:53:00]  Really?  Yes.  A book of Shortcuts.  A book of Shortcuts.  Are you kidding?  What, would all of a sudden you'd be in traffic and go thumbing through a book looking for a shortcut?  What I would do is I would pretty much go, like, route to places where I typically hit traffic.  Like, you know, I'm not going to say where, just so no one else knows.  I would use little shortcuts.  I would read the book.  Oh, yeah, I could go this way and try that.  I got lost a few times.  You know what I used to use?  I'd go from Jersey to Brooklyn, and I'd have to jump off the awful Staten Island Expressway. 
[01:53:30]  That is horrible.  And they would show you back roads along Richmond or wherever, just how to kind of go parallel with it and get to the Varrazano without hitting the Staten Island Expressway.  Without being on the always clogged Staten Island Expressway.  And you'd hit a little traffic, but you'd save yourself a bevy of time.  Yeah.  A bevy.  Bevy.  B-E-V-Y.  XM, I know, is coming out with that whole traffic thing, too, where they're going to have in their unit.  Well, it's going to be something where you not only know where you are, like a navigation system, but it updates with traffic reports. 
[01:54:00]  And you'll see on your map where traffic areas are, and it'll show you how to bypass those.  Now, is it going to be a brand-new unit, though?  It's not going to be able to show on this unit, right?  What, am I a tech guy?  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  I just heard this.  Can I be a talk to Eric Logan?  No, I would like to sit down in a nice long meeting with Elo and discuss this whole thing.  I would, too.  I'm terribly busy playing video games and poker and whatnot.  There's a new line of Eric Logan wigs coming out.  Are there?  Yep. 
[01:54:30]  You know, that's his hair.  I know.  He doesn't wear a wig or anything.  No, no, he doesn't wear a wig.  Yeah.  He should, but he doesn't.  Anything would be an improvement.  Maybe the Juan Epstein wig would be nice.  All right.  We're going to take another break and regroup, and then we'll get into, like...  Only a half hour we talked.  It's okay.  Wow.  We're going to take another break.  That's what we do.  We did an hour and a half, then we do 20 minutes.  We do what we want.  You're right.  And then we've got to talk about the drunk pilot and the...  I mean, flying's easy. 
[01:55:00]  The ice cream pervs can't work the ice cream trucks anymore.  Damn it.  And the transsexual that was a guy who's now a chick, and she's...  She.  A cop.  He.  She's a cop.  I don't call these things she.  Well, that's because you're mean-spirited.  You just don't get it.  It's now a dickless man.  No.  A tranny is a girl with an asterisk.  Let's go.  Kevin in Jersey.  Kevin.  Yeah.  The XM Cadillac traffic's already out. 
[01:55:30]  It's only on a limited number of cars, but I think you can get it on the Acura RL.  Yeah?  Yeah.  It's like a little bit extra on top of your regular XM subscription, and then you get it  in your car, hook it up to your nav system, and it shows you where the traffic is and gives  you all that route.  Oh, you hook it up to your navigation, so the unit itself looks like a regular XM unit, but  it's just a hook up to the navigation thing.  Okay.  Yeah.  It's like a little bit extra they put in there, and they highlight the roads that are  clear and the roads that have a lot of traffic on it.  And then if you put in your navigation system that you're going from point A to point B and 
[01:56:00]  it puts you on this highway, it'll check, and if there's traffic, it'll reroute you  around the traffic.  But what about, here's my thing, does the navigation system have to already be in the, like, this  is one of the units that comes in the car?  It can come in the car, but you can get it, like, the Acura comes, I think, with the car,  but you can get it in, like, some Pioneer new unit with a big display.  I want one of those.  And you can figure out where you're going or how to get it out.  I want one of those. 
[01:56:30]  Who wouldn't?  You can buy one, then.  All right.  Thanks.  All right.  Thanks, sir.  Later.  I was stalling, but...  Why?  He was good.  No, I want to play something going on a break, but we can't find it.  You do.  Find it, Hawk.  E-Rock.  It was another Led Zepp.  E-Rock now.  Everyone's calling him E-Rock.  Paul's who E-Rock?  He's E-Rock.  Did you hear the new promo?  E-Rock.  I did, but I didn't...  Did you play that new promo?  Because we weren't able to comment on it.  Hurry up, Derek.  These fuckers behind the scenes are messing with E-Rock so bad.  Who's E-Rock? 
[01:57:00]  That's E-Rock.  They want to call him E-Rock now.  Hawk, Eric.  E-Rock.  Oh, you got it?  E-Rock.  All right.  See, now he found it so he can play a sweeper.  No, no.  He found E-Rock sweeper.  Ben's calling a little attention here to Hawk.  These guys are making these promos just to mess with him.  They don't care if the listeners like it or if it makes sense for the radio show.  Just to mess with Eric.  Right.  So, what's up with the naked guy?  I don't know.  It's a queer eye thing.  Oh, it's funny.  All right, well.  What are they going to do?  Remodel his asshole? 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  Make it much larger.  Yeah, wait.  This needs room for at least two fists and a watch.  It's Gay Pride weekend in New York.  It is?  Yeah.  All right.  And Billy Graham's in town.  How ironic.  Wow, that ought to be a good mixture of people.  When is Billy's boat ride?  Let me give him a quick plug because I do love Billy Mac.  Jesus.  I have to give him a plug.  I love Billy Mac.  When is this boat ride?  It's on there.  Well, could you have had smaller font?  What the fuck is this for? 
[01:58:00]  He prints it out tiny.  It's on...  All right, you figure that out.  Hold on.  All right.  Hey, Big Cock, find that.  We've got three things going on at the same time.  I know we're just goofing off today.  It's Friday.  Friday.  It's Friday?  Friday, boarding at 645.  The best part about this is the boat cruise takes right off where Billy Graham's going  to be.  This Dykes boat cruise that Billy's got.  Divas, Dames, and Dykes.com.  Does he have any reservations for it?  I think it's almost sold out.  All right.  Well, bring your partner. 
[01:58:30]  You know, this third floor is going to double as a hospice.  So there can be a...  Jesus.  Dancing, drinking, and grieving.  Jimmy's like stumbling through his bed.  Still going with it.  All right, listen.  We got the promo.  Here's the E-Rock promo.  They made this just to mess with him, like I said.  It has nothing to do with...  Oh, SS sarcoma.  Here we go.  Hit that. 
[01:59:00]  The ship went sail.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Unpredictable.  Unleashed.  Unruly.  Unwashed.  Unkempt.  I stink.  Next thing I knew, I had my pants down around my knees, and my shirt pulled up to my armpits.  Shut up.  No.  Who cares?  I can't believe you fell for that again.  Damn you, Hawk.  That's funny.  Let's just make an E-Rock promo.  E-Rock.  That's great.  But I am E-Rock. 
[01:59:30]  E-Rock, huh?  Do you prefer...  Do you like E-Rock?  Yeah, it's not bad.  That's good that four of us heard it.  How about the rest of the country?  A little too cool.  Pedophile beard.  It's not bad.  It's better than a sex bagel.  That's true.  Yeah.  Yeah, but you went with sex bagel for many years.  That was the worst name ever.  Sex bagel, Eric.  E-Rock.  I like to have sex bagels.  Jesus.  Cream cheese on it.  Through the hole.  That's not the one.  Sorry.  I can't find it.  That one almost bombed, but then Ben added it into the hole, and it just kind of grew up 
[02:00:00]  in the hole.  Just made it disgusting enough to be enjoyable.  Tell him, Fred.  Tell him, Fred.  Can I explain the bit that would have killed, but we can't find one of our classic O&A bits?  Just talk us through it.  I'm sure it'll be just as good.  I was going to say, hey, guys, we have another tribute band, another Led Zeppelin tribute band,  and I was going to hit play, and it was going to be the Terry Schiavo singing to the immigrant  song.  That's my gag.  Nothing's better than when somebody's sitting in this studio and says something, and you 
[02:00:30]  lean over and just do that in their face.  It's awful.  That could be the most uncomfortable thing.  Oh, my God.  I can't even look.  Yeah.  It's just such a mockery.  Because it's not just the sound, people.  If you were in here and saw the face Ovi makes when he does it, it's just this condescending,  like, that sucked, and I'm laughing at you.  A lot of times, I'll just stare right at him and do it, too.  Yeah.  No problem.  Hold the mic really aggressively.  Hold the mic and lean into him.  A two-handed aggressive mic hold. 
[02:01:00]  Horrible.  But that would have been funny, and people like that Terry Schiavo immigrant song.  I know.  That is a good one.  We can't find it.  We lost it.  Oh, well.  Well, we'll do it when we come back.  How about that?  I mean, there's no need to surprise people.  We're not going to find it.  Why not?  I think if you want it, somebody will get to it.  We're not going to find it.  We're going to Iraq shuffling through those.  Yeah.  How do we not have that labeled properly?  I don't know what kind of system he has.  He takes four out, looks, sees that it's not in there, then puts a rubber band around  four of them, puts it back. 
[02:01:30]  Maybe you could do this more expeditiously and stop re-rubber banding them.  He's like fucking re-rubber banding them.  Why don't you just change the font while we're here waiting on the air?  I don't know what his system is.  One day, yeah.  One day, we're going to have to get into his OCD problems.  I know.  Come on, Hawk Rock.  It's a mess.  It's E-Rock.  Oh.  All right.  Here we go.  As we go to break, Howard Stern talking about XM Satellite Radio.  If you're planning a road trip this weekend, it's time to take XM Satellite Radio along  for the ride. 
[02:02:00]  XM gives you 100% commercial-free music.  It's the ultimate playlist with channels for album rock, alternative, heavy metal, hip-hop,  unsigned bands, blues, jazz.  There's an XM channel for everyone in the family, including the biggest names in news,  sports, talk, and comedy.  All in digital quality sound for less than $10 a month.  No wonder it's the most listened-to satellite radio service.  The XM Roadie from Delphi can turn any radio into an XM radio.  It's the smallest satellite radio ever, so it looks great on your dashboard. 
[02:02:30]  Plus, for a limited time, you'll also get a free home kit so you can connect XM to any  home stereo.  XM makes a great graduation or Father's Day gift.  Check it out.  Electronic stores, including Best Buy and Circuit City.  Beyond AM.  Beyond FM.  It's XM Satellite Radio.  Hey, what's that?  You've never seen it before?  Looks like a rock.  New from Sedentary Toys and The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, it's so shiny.  It's got corners.  It's the cool new toy that has everyone jumping for joy.  O&A Party Rock!  It's not just any rock.  It's the O&A Party Rock! 
[02:03:00]  The O&A Party Rock is incredibly versatile.  You can chuck it.  You can buck it.  You can drop it in a bucket.  You can race it.  You can chase it.  You can yell right in its face.  It's the bestest friend you'll ever have.  O&A Party Rock!  Why is it wearing a party hat?  Every Party Rock comes dressed in a colorful party hat and party blower, making it the  centerpiece of any party.  Now with shiny red dancing shoes.  Not only that, the O&A Party Rock is...  is...  is...  is a fucking rock, you dildo.  ... 
[02:03:30]  I need a copy. 
[02:04:00]  I need some Raisin Bran's crunches, that little thing.  You know what I like.  All wrinkle now.  Thanks.  You guys suck.  Lucky I'll rip it up and throw it at him.  What's wrong, Anthony?  Someone wants a picture of Opie and Anthony signed.  And I sign it, pass it to Opie.  And it's like, oh, you sign this?  And then just, I don't know what you did to it.  I've seen you autograph billions of items.  And you'd make the big O.  And then you'd do the line. 
[02:04:30]  And then you'd do a sweeping P.  And then the I, E goes kind of underneath the P awning.  Well, the E with the three lines.  Right.  Top one always has to be separated.  Kind of disconnected from the other two.  Or it's not an official autograph.  Yeah.  It says rock on, exclamation point.  And I don't know what you just did, but I saw you scribble on this dot and I.  But I think I saw you cross a T.  And I know Opie doesn't.  I don't know what you did.  And then Jimmy took it.  I poked the hole right in the thing.  And then Jimmy took it and just scribbled on it. 
[02:05:00]  Like scribbled out someone's face.  Across both of your faces.  Crinkled it up and threw it.  You guys are horrible.  That's right.  Mail that out.  No, it's when they stop asking.  That's when, oh, worry.  That's when there's a problem.  Not when they ask for autographs.  It's not a problem.  What's that from?  I don't know.  All right.  We should do it again.  Why don't we get another publicity photo to sign?  All right.  Yeah, get another one, Hawk.  It's a very, I guess we got a brand new publicity photo that's going to be out there soon. 
[02:05:30]  Soon.  One we finally like.  It includes a little Jimmy in it.  Little Jimmy, yes.  So Jimmy has a place to sign, finally.  I always like signing the soundboard.  I know.  I didn't mind that.  Hey, Jimmy.  So many people are like, why isn't Jimmy in these photos?  And we always would be like, eh.  It's not font size when you're referring to text.  It's point size, you cum drinker.  Is that?  Wait.  Text.  The size of the font.  Well, font is the style of writing, of letter. 
[02:06:00]  So I guess the font size, while not completely incorrect.  Anthony, you've got to sign first, because you're on the left side.  I'll sign nice.  Be nice.  I do the A, the A, that, and then I do a little squiggly thing down my Y, for some reason.  All right.  I've taken to do that over the course of the years.  Let me sign this right here.  He's got the pen.  That's not even close.  What did that say?  Hold that up so I can look.  It looks like it.  It says, um, blah. 
[02:06:30]  That's how I sign now.  That's the paragraph.  It's retard writing.  It'll make the old autographs valuable now, because that's now how I sign.  Jimmy just signed across Opie's face.  Jimmy, like a mongoloid, wrote it.  That's terrible.  There you go.  That one's a little better.  That's fine.  A little crinkly.  I used to love that.  When they would ask me to sign something, I would just write, Jim on Ant's face and Norton 
[02:07:00]  on Opie's face.  And I know a lot of people went home with just ruined photos.  The best one ever.  And I felt bad, because it made everyone else laugh.  Up in Boston.  Yeah, the female.  Yep.  Where she kept saying her name, and you would write a different name.  Oh, always.  And then she finally just said, ah, just keep your fucking picture.  And she threw it down the table and walked down.  I'm like, this is great.  You like the one I ripped up?  This is how we treat our fans.  Are you kidding me?  I ripped up one, and then we laughed it off, and then I threw water on our next one.  There was one that she stormed out. 
[02:07:30]  Oh, that was the one with the water, yeah.  Yeah, she stormed out all pissed off.  What's that for?  What?  Why do we have to redo it?  Why do we have to redo it?  Yep.  We're going to redo it.  That's how it says for an important client.  Oh, all right.  Who's the important client, Ben?  I didn't know that.  Give it to Opie.  Give me that one.  How important is this client?  Yeah, how important?  That's a good...  Anthony would definitely like the client.  It's a very important client.  Are they important to you or to XM?  What are they?  Are they working for you specifically?  Are they condom reinforcers?  No.  They had to do with the store. 
[02:08:00]  The store that we...  It's a very...  For the owner of the store that we did the signing.  That's a very important client.  All right.  Yeah.  This is what I do now.  There you go.  That's right.  Hope he's important enough to have an employee who's good at taping.  Guys are horrible, man.  What is this?  Who is this person?  That's the gay guy.  That's Carson.  Carson from Queer Eyes for the Straight Guy.  That was awful.  He is the gayest human being on the face of the earth. 
[02:08:30]  The gayest.  And he has almost collagen lips.  There's something on his lips.  Not even close.  One of the things you say is a lot of people mistake you for being gay.  Right.  Tell me, what is it about the way you look, the way you dress, that people say that?  And do you care?  Yeah, I care.  A lot of, in this business and television I model for a long time, you dress a certain  way because you have to keep up with certain appearance.  He is gay.  And also, when I hear women complimenting other guys or girls talking to each other saying, 
[02:09:00]  oh, that guy had a really nice shirt on, that guy looked really good, I start to pay attention.  And I think what Carson did on Queer Eye, for example, he did a great thing.  He gave these guys makeovers.  So I had to pay attention to how I was looking.  And as you start to look a little better, you start to look a little bit more put together,  if you will, people start to think, oh, you must be gay because you care.  That's not true.  Carson, let's talk a little bit about these looks.  Oh, my God.  Look how gay this guy is.  He's not the gayest guy on TV, though.  Wait, did he?  What?  Listen to him.  I didn't hear him.  He's talking now. 
[02:09:30]  Listen.  He's really adapting this look as well.  Well, you know, like the pink oxford is a thing that we had talked about in saying,  oh, you know, this was traditionally a gay thing.  This is actually a very traditional shirt.  I mean, Brooks Brothers did the pink oxford, you know, 50 years ago.  Some of these other things, you know.  Who's the gayest guy on TV?  Who's the gayest guy?  One of our old faves.  Oh, that guy.  The ball guy from the, what is it?  The hole.  Christopher Lowell.  Yeah.  Oh, permission to come aboard. 
[02:10:00]  Oh, yeah.  They were doing some kind of nautical motif in a room.  And the carpenter guy is working on something.  And he walks in, looks around, and goes, oh, permission to come aboard.  That guy is so much gayer.  Yeah.  All right.  What do you guys want to do here?  Oh, we've got to sign this thing.  Queer eye from the straight guy must be fun to get a makeover by those guys.  Oh, a bunch of fags come to your house and redo your house and then make you over.  And then later on they bring your friends and family and girlfriend back in to see their new, the new look. 
[02:10:30]  I'd let them do my apartment, but I wouldn't want them to throw out my kiss, framed kiss poster or any of my other stuff.  Oh, they would, why don't you sign on me?  I'll sign on you now.  Oh, I just wouldn't want them throwing out my, um.  Here, sign that so we can move on with this stuff.  Signed over me.  Why?  As long as they don't throw my stuff out, I don't care what they do.  You know, that's all that really matters.  You can't sign that. 
[02:11:00]  There you go.  Sign that.  Sign that.  There you go.  That's what an important client gets.  There you go.  All right.  Well, we got the, uh.  Oh, yes.  Airplane guy.  Well.  That's a fun little story.  Everyone.  This just goes to show you anyone can fly a plane.  Just stop it.  Plane crazy joyride.  Student busted in Beery night flight.  Beery night flight.  That's a tough one.  Yeah.  They're getting really strange with their headlines. 
[02:11:30]  Beer.  E.  Him and two 16-year-olds, I think.  A drunken man without a pilot's license stole a small plane in Connecticut.  And took two pals on a three-hour joyride early yesterday before somehow landing at  a darkened Westchester Airport authority set.  All right.  I have a problem right off the bat.  Yeah.  God.  This guy's friends are way too trusting.  Yeah.  16 and drunk with this guy?  It's not trusting.  It's just being 16 and drunk.  You do anything.  Dude.  You're indestructible.  Look.  I understand, you know, growing up, we did that old, uh, that old sport called drinking 
[02:12:00]  and driving.  Yeah.  With your pals.  That's so much fun.  But this guy is saying, hey, we're going to steal a plane tonight.  And you've got to think the friends would say, well, have you ever flown before or do  you have a license?  And this guy's like, no, I don't have a license, but don't worry.  It'll be okay.  I think I got the hang of it.  That's trusting.  That's trusting.  You think it's trusting or being drunk at 16 years old?  How many kids?  How many teenagers are...  I know a lot of drunk guys at 16 that did real stupid stuff.  Are just going to go up in a plane with your friend that doesn't have a license? 
[02:12:30]  Did real stupid stuff.  I understand stupid stuff.  This is beyond stupid.  Apparently he was flying for three hours.  Yeah.  Landed at a darkened airport.  Yeah.  Landed on the taxiway.  Mm-hmm.  Not even the runway, because the runway was closed at a darkened airport.  I don't know how you find a darkened runway from up there.  How does that work?  But he did.  He thought he was somewhere else, too.  He was a little lost.  And he got arrested. 
[02:13:00]  He was all belligerent with the cobs.  Was he?  Yeah.  You know, everyone else on TV is playing this as a very serious story.  Well, they're throwing in a terror threat, yeah.  But it's just plain funny.  When airport security...  Plain funny.  That's a good one, Opie.  Put-um-pum.  No.  When airport security met the four-seat Cessna at 4.15 a.m. and its doors opened, a significant  number of beer cans tumbled out.  They're drinking in the plane.  They're just drinking and flying.  Why not? 
[02:13:30]  The dude that was flying the plane, his blood alcohol level was .15.  That's fucked up.  Nearly double the legal limit for driving in New York State.  Mm-hmm.  His two passengers, both 16, were not identified or charged with the crime.  The single-engine plane was nearly out of gas.  Oops.  When Patricio, who had just seven hours of...  Patrice O'Neal?  Patricio, who had just seven hours of student...  Would have needed a C-130 to lift him off the runway.  Who had just seven hours of student flight time landed at Westchester County Airport. 
[02:14:00]  Oh, he had a couple hours of flight time?  Seven hours.  Seven hours.  Seven hours.  That's it.  There you go.  When he landed, he was able to guide his craft into a small taxiway without lights at the  Westchester Airport, which was closed for overnight construction.  They turned off the lights at 11 o'clock at night, Anthony.  He landed around 4.15.  Landed with no lights.  He was charged with possession of stolen property and reckless endangerment.  No state laws apply to flying while intoxicated, Anthony.  So he also was charged with drunken driving while rolling the plane through the airport. 
[02:14:30]  Hold on.  There's no drunken flying law.  No state laws applying to flying while intoxicated.  So he also was charged with drunken driving when he was on the ground.  Because once you're on the ground and you're rolling the plane, now you're driving?  Right.  So they got him for drunk driving of an airplane.  Right.  Yeah.  Wow.  And, yeah, a lot of politicians up in arms about airport security.  Because if this guy can just get into a plane and take off, who else can? 
[02:15:00]  The terrorists, Opie.  They could grab one of these planes and perhaps crash into somebody's backyard shed.  Take out some shovels.  I think they're blowing this thing out of proportion.  It's not like the guy had a 767 with him.  I don't think he should go to jail.  He should get, like, a little slap on the wrist.  Because he just showed the incompetence of these.  Don't make an example out of them.  Just fix the fucking problem.  Yeah, there seems to be a little problem at the smaller airports. 
[02:15:30]  Stupid assholes we are.  We didn't even learn nothing.  Can someone explain how he stole the plane?  I've heard a lot of these.  Yeah, I know.  But I've heard a lot of these planes just have the keys in them and they're just sitting there.  Yeah, a lot of these guys leave the keys in there.  Because it's not one of these things where all of a sudden your plane's going to get stolen.  You know what I mean?  Everyone knows everybody else.  They just kind of have their planes ready to go with the keys in them.  I said this guy might have heisted a key at some point when he was at that airport and kept the key. 
[02:16:00]  But, yeah, it's just like anything else.  You just turn the key.  You're off.  Off and running.  But the friends had to be brave.  All right, I'll go up with you.  What the hell?  I'll admit, that is kind of a ballsy thing to do as a kid, even if you're drunk.  Let's go to Todd in D.C.  What's up, Todd?  Hey, you.  Owen Wilson, Jeff Goldblum, looking sons of bitches.  Well, there you go.  Morning, Jimmy.  Hi.  Hey, this is serious.  I agree with Anthony.  In fact, when we were kids, we had a buddy that used to fly at the 150s.  And he took us up many, many times. 
[02:16:30]  Anyway, my buddies actually stole that plane when he wasn't there.  And they crashed and died.  But the only reason that they didn't make the news is because there was a big crash that same day where that guy jumped in the water and, you know, saved that girl in D.C.?  Yep.  That was the same day.  But you can actually steal the plane.  These knuckleheads did it, and they died.  All right.  There you go.  Thanks, Todd.  It was right outside a false church, and they have a monument for it.  How about that?  How about that is right. 
[02:17:00]  When my brother was going for his pilot's license, he was allowed to solo, but not allowed to have passengers in the plane.  He was at that point in his flying.  And he used to get the Cessna 152, which is a really small plane, and pull it around by the fuel tanks and tell my friend Joe Curry,  go, just wait, wait here.  I'll pull the plane around, and then you jump in.  And, yeah, he would pull around.  Joe Curry would jump in the passenger side, and he'd take off and fly around with his friend, 
[02:17:30]  even though he wasn't rated to have anybody in the plane.  How high would he go?  Like, what altitude?  Yeah, you're cruising around, what, 3,500, 4,000 feet, cruising around.  They used to have a practice.  They still do, I guess, a practice area out over, like, off of Jones Beach, Fire Island, out there over the water is where you go to practice.  Basically an area if they crash.  Yeah, if you crash, you're not taking anyone out.  So you'd go out there and practice your turns and stuff like that, and then come back to the airport and go around the pattern a few times. 
[02:18:00]  He'd land.  Joe would get out, and then he'd pull the plane back up where it was supposed to be.  So there's all kinds of shenanigans going on.  Your brother's a pilot's license?  With these aircraft.  Yeah.  Not like where he could take passengers up.  Is he instrument qualified?  Is that the point?  No, no, no, not instrument yet.  Is he flying still?  No, he hasn't flown in a while.  He was just saying the other day he wants to get started doing it again.  But it's, yeah, believe me, my brother could do it. 
[02:18:30]  That's what killed JFK Jr.  He was not instrument qualified.  And at night, man, it gets confusing when you can't follow the sight lines.  People get psyched about it, you know?  You get, hey, you're kind of new at it, and if your weekend is coming up and you want to fly and the weather's not right,  you're like, well, I've been waiting all week, and you go up and you take your life in your hands, you know?  If it's hazy like it was when JFK Jr. was flying, you can't see your horizon, that's big trouble.  A lot of people don't realize.  Yeah, and then it's getting dark out. 
[02:19:00]  But if you can't see the horizon, your body will screw with you where you could be turning and not even know it.  Not even know you're turning.  You look, you feel like you're straight, but you're actually turning over, or you're going up or down.  You're pitching down.  You want to see how bad equilibrium can be?  And I noticed this.  I was on the treadmill.  I just did this.  Like, take your hands off it, close your eyes for a few seconds, and watch how fast you're ready to fall on your dumb face.  I mean, this is walking, which I've been doing for 36 years. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  And I'm still like, wow, your eyes have to be open.  I don't know how blind people do it.  I mean, the sidewalks don't move.  But I mean, it really is weird.  Like, just in that, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, it doesn't matter how automatic it is.  When you get off the treadmill, and then walk around a little bit, and try shutting your eyes then, it'll topple right over.  I'd get too dizzy, Ant.  But if you're not instrument rated, you got to, they always say, trust your instruments before you trust your body.  Because your body will tell you that you're going up, you're going sideways. 
[02:20:00]  Always look at your instruments, and you'll know what your plane is doing.  When you're underwater, you blow bubbles to see which way it's up.  That's what you have to do, whichever way the air bubbles go.  There you go.  If you're ever disoriented.  Bubbles is, of course, your fellow diver.  Absolutely.  Well-hung Brazilian fellow.  That old gag.  Thanks, Bubbles.  Thanks, Bubbles.  This way up?  Thanks.  Now I take you up.  Guys, good news coming out of Albany.  Yeah.  Our politicians hard at work on this one.  Brand new legislation coming out this morning. 
[02:20:30]  Albany.  State lawmakers yesterday struck a deal on what they're calling the Mr. Softy Bill.  Mr. Softy Bill.  They spent a lot of time there in Albany to get this done, so.  It's a measure.  I hate named bills, by the way.  Me too.  I can't stand when they name a bill after somebody, or a law, after a child, or a person.  Yeah.  Gotta stay away from a schoolyard.  What kind of nonsense is that?  Norton's Law.  This bill should be called, What Took You So Long? 
[02:21:00]  The What Took You So Long Bill.  Yeah, you would think this would have been in place for a while, but no.  Albany.  State lawmakers yesterday struck a deal on what they're calling the Mr. Softy Bill, a measure  that bans sexual perverts from working on ice cream trucks.  Yeah.  How about that?  They spent all.  They had to make a law?  They had to make a bill.  There ought to be some kind of law.  Had to be a law.  Isn't this just common sense?  You would think. 
[02:21:30]  If you're hiring people to drive around your ice cream trucks, you might want to ask a  few questions.  You're dealing with children.  Right.  If you show up for work in an ice cream truck and you're wearing swim trunks with  the lining taken out, you probably shouldn't be working on the ice cream truck.  The legislation prohibits.  Wrap a piece of cardboard around your cock and it's a pink tip push-up, kid.  Lick away.  G-gong, g-gong, g-g-g-g-gong, that awful ice cream music.  Oh, that you just hear every day going through the neighborhoods.  The child's tear-stained face against that cold little thing that holds all the ice cream 
[02:22:00]  in the little freezer.  The little garbage thing that looks like a dragon's mouth.  They paint it like a dragon.  Yeah.  The cock comes out of it.  Arr, quick, you've got to kiss him to make friends.  Jesus, graphic.  Put some sprinkles on your pecker.  Free samples today, kids.  Fat kid grabs it with his chocolatey fingers and you want to go, not you.  It's not for you. 
[02:22:30]  Get that blonde kid.  You know, the one with the nice part that I like.  I'm sorry.  The legislation prohibits any sex offender required to register with the state under Megan's law  from working on the trucks.  It's amazing.  They even had a waste of time on this.  Yeah, because that's pretty much an occupation where you're dealing with kids.  And a lot of kids.  And a lot of time, unsupervised kids.  Well, Assembly sponsor Patricia Eddington said the bill is a result of several cases 
[02:23:00]  throughout the state in which children were molested by ice cream truck workers.  Of course.  What a job for a pedophile, though.  Jesus.  How do they get them in that truck, though?  Huh?  How do you get them in the truck?  What, do they just lean over that big hole in the side and go,  wham, wham, and just grab a handful of Yan bag?  Yeah.  Kid, put your hand through here and this will help you get the ice cream faster.  Yeah.  Ho, ho.  Mama, I got Nilla on my hand. 
[02:23:30]  And finally, he's a she-cop.  NYPD's first transsexual is another J-Lo?  No, do it live, dude.  Oh, in here?  Yeah, why not?  Okay, I got to pee first.  I want to come back and do the call.  Okay.  But, no, Opie.  But what?  Where are you going?  I have to tinkle.  Well, we want you to do it on...  Do you want me to tinkle live?  No, not that.  I'll be right back.  I got to pee. 
[02:24:00]  But, hey.  It is, like, even better.  Hang on.  That?  Yeah.  That is killer, man.  What is it?  Is this true?  It's completely confirmed, and everyone's so excited.  How did...  Well, someone has to explain.  Okay.  They're just handing this to us.  Travis, you want in on this?  So, it's instant feedback.  You know our instant feedback.  It's a great little tool for the show. 
[02:24:30]  People are able to comment on things going on during the show without having to get through  on the phone.  And we read them here, and sometimes we read them on the air.  They're very funny.  Sometimes they're just comments to us saying they love the show, they hate the show.  Sometimes they request bits.  That's what they do.  And I was handed the O&A show live feedback form.  Now, this is a printout of what people who go to instant feedback have to fill out.  First name, last name, email address, from, and then the message. 
[02:25:00]  A max to 250 characters, and then send it.  Boink.  Well, this is from Joey, last name, gay, email address, shitdick at AOL.com, from, and it  says whackbag.com, and then it says, I like that Led Zeppelin tribute with Robert Kelly  singing lead.  Play the Rob Kelly remix with Zeppelin.  And apparently, our private investigators around the studios here have found out, we observed 
[02:25:30]  that this was being sent from a cubicle here in the XM Studios.  It's coming from inside the studio.  And by observing, they have found that it was indeed Harry T, the new intern, requesting  his own material, trying to request his own shit under an assumed name.  While he's interning. 
[02:26:00]  What are you, while you're interning, you're requesting your own stuff.  I, now, is this, oh.  Oh, no, I'm coughing to it.  You're coughing up to it.  Yeah, it was, it was more because, towards the end, someone else threw one in.  Oh, you played the other Zeppelin one.  I'm like, let me see if we can play that one.  No, someone else didn't write it.  And, um, no, they played another Zeppelin one.  Dude, you're recording.  You're requesting your own material to be played.  No, yeah.  We enjoyed it, thought it was really good.  Apparently, it hasn't been played enough for Harry. 
[02:26:30]  Well, couldn't you have just walked in here with your terrycloth shirt and requested  it?  Couldn't you have just asked us?  I felt like the bit was done, so I just throw it in and just toss it in.  I also wanted to see if anyone could find out, too.  Shut up, stupid.  You didn't want to see if anyone could find out.  You did not.  You did not.  Really?  That's why this kid flew the plane.  I was just testing security.  Just seeing what the hell.  All the beers and everything didn't matter.  Wow.  Wow.  That real...  You know what?  That kind of...  I'm getting a douche chill.  ...reeks of desperation a little bit. 
[02:27:00]  I'm getting a douche chill.  It does reek of desperation a bit.  I don't deny that.  We complimented you on it.  It was very funny.  But, you know, I don't think you can just rest on that.  No, I know.  I don't expect to, but I thought I'd just try it.  I just think you kind of tossed it in there, hoping we would play it and then go, oh, and  by the way, that was done by Harry.  Oh, yeah.  There's no denying that.  And then Harry, great job and stuff.  So you're not even denying any of that.  No.  No.  I got caught.  That's it.  You got caught.  Yeah.  I'm going to plead guilty and hopefully... 
[02:27:30]  I like the Zeppelin tribute with Robert Kelly singing lead.  Play that Rob Kelly remake.  Play the Robert Kelly remake.  And even put W slash Zeppelin.  Right.  You know, like a regular Joe.  Yeah.  And Joey Gay shit dick?  Well, Joey Gay's an actual...  A real guy I know.  He is.  He's an actual comic.  Is he really?  He's a comedian, yeah.  His name is Joey Gay.  Joey Gay.  But it did theoretically get me in here.  So I can't say that it didn't work...  Did not work completely.  Well, taking a shit on the desk would have gotten you in here.  I did too.  I mean, that doesn't necessarily mean it was a bright move. 
[02:28:00]  And from Wack Bag.  Well, that's...  It's automatic.  That would help...  No, it's just automatic.  If you don't put something in there, it just says from Wack...  Like, I went through Wack Bag.  Yeah.  Like, that's why a lot of the posts say...  Is that a default kind of thing that just pops in there?  Martini Steven's studio to help us out here.  Steve?  Steve?  Steve.  Yeah.  Is this on?  Yeah, okay.  It looks like they copied the code and put it on their own website.  That didn't come from OpieAnthony.com.  Oh, it didn't?  No.  No, I went through Wack Bag.  That's the only way I knew it. 
[02:28:30]  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  You do know the interns are not allowed to go on to Wack Bag.  Yes.  Yeah, hi, Pete.  I'm on the radio.  How are you?  No posting allowed.  I don't post at all.  I was just looking for the instant feedback.  I didn't know how to find it.  Things like posting on Wack Bag for interns.  Things like even IMing other people.  No.  Sending private messages to other people through Wack Bag.  None of that is really accepted.  I'm not a big internet poster.  Dude, did you get this one here?  Play some cuts from Yellow Discipline. 
[02:29:00]  It was from EAB.com.  I wonder what that is.  You can't request your own stuff under an assumed name.  This is very uncomfortable.  Isn't it?  Yeah.  It would have been, if you would have signed it, you, like, from Harry.  Our intern requesting his own material from a cubicle out there.  Oh, it's creepy.  Wow.  That is really creepy.  It is.  It really is creepy.  That's a good word for it.  Creepy.  Oh.  What are you doing, Travis?  Huh?  Oh, yeah.  Check instant feedback.  Jesus, Travis.  What are you doing?  Oh, you're not here? 
[02:29:30]  Everyone's waving.  Travis is not here.  Everyone's waving off the plane.  Now, we've got to make believe he's not here.  It's a different, though.  Now that we just acknowledge that he's here, now we have to make believe he's not here.  It's different.  Jesus.  What was 5'11", infant saying?  What were you saying?  Nothing.  I didn't see.  I'm not 5'11".  How tall are you?  6'2".  You're not 6'2".  Don't even start that shit with me.  You're not 6'2".  This has been an ongoing thing with Steve and I.  There was, back in the day, before we got Club Soda Kenny and Master Poe, you know, 
[02:30:00]  Anthony and I were doing this popular radio show, and we felt like we needed security  at times.  And, you know, Martini Steve was doing production and stuff, and before his stomach stapling,  he was, what, 400 pounds?  400 pounds, yeah.  400 pounds, and he looked like he was 6'2", 6'3".  Okay?  Yeah.  Well, he gets the stomach staple surgery, and he loses 150 pounds, something like that.  He's down under 3, way under 3.  Yeah, 270.  And he also decided to stop wearing his platform shoes, Anthony, that made him 6'2". 
[02:30:30]  Mm-hmm.  The guy's not even taller than me.  Well, I'm a little bit taller than you.  Back in the day, we felt like we were being protected by this monster.  It turns out you were wearing platform shoes that gave you 3 inches.  Well, I used to wear them.  Still, no one would screw with them.  Yeah, I wouldn't exactly consider myself meek at the moment.  I mean...  Do you think you could kick Steve's ass?  No, of course not.  Yeah, exactly.  But it's all about looking intimidating.  And, you know, all of a sudden he drops down 3 inches and drops 150 pounds.  He's not as intimidating as he used to be.  Maybe there was like a quarter inch of fat on the bottom of my feet. 
[02:31:00]  Fat feet.  But, you know, but for many years, I'm just assuming that Steve was that much taller than  me.  And one day, we're walking on the sidewalk.  I'm like, what the fuck?  You're as tall as I am.  I just can't believe how offended you are.  I wasn't consciously duping you about my height.  I thought that's how tall I was.  You were duping.  I could get old tapes where we used to ask you how tall you were, and you're like,  ah, 6'2", 6'3".  I think, no, whatever.  If I'm not, I'm not.  He's a liar, liar.  Everything he wears on fire.  All right, well, here's Harry T's remix. 
[02:31:30]  Are you playing it?  Yeah, we'll play it.  I got another request here.  Oh, yeah?  It says, hey, those Pat O'Brien remixes were so good, especially the Terry Schiavo one  and the two Norton ones.  And it's from Not Danny or Not Than.  From Not New York City.  Yeah.  Harry T.  Okay, well, this one's going out to Joey Gay.  Right.  Well, Harry.  I requested this.  You accomplished your mission. 
[02:32:00]  You accomplished it by just losing respect and dignity.  But now we're all going to look at you a little differently.  Yeah.  Thinking, oh, God, there goes the creepy guy.  Creepy guy that requests his own material.  His own one bit.  Wait, Norton wants to do it in here.  Where's Jimmy?  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  I broke my knee, man. 
[02:32:30]  Fuck.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my fucking knee, dude.  I broke it, dude.  I broke it.  I broke it.  I broke it.  I broke my leg.  I broke it.  Fuck.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Hold my hand, boy.  I've got to squeeze something.  You know, somehow it's just not as funny anymore.  I know.  It sticks now.  Someone's got to dial this number for you.  All right.  Tony, go ahead. 
[02:33:00]  Hey, punish that motherfucker.  Make him read for Rent Boys.  Do we still have Rent Boys, man?  We certainly do.  All right.  Get Rent Boys.  Ugh.  And let's go to Super Golfer from Whack Bag.  Super Golfer.  Hiya, boys.  Hey.  I want to know, is that intern?  See, we're in an eyepatch.  Wow, you're going way back.  We might have to tell the eyepatch story again.  We get creepy interns from time to time.  The eyepatch guy.  Well, there was Luca that we nicknamed her Luca because she came in with black eyes and  stuff.  She was always beat up.  And then one day she just never showed up again. 
[02:33:30]  We still have no idea what ever happened to her.  Just disappeared.  Just disappeared.  And then there was the eyepatch kid who missed a few days' work and then came in with this  crazy story.  Brian, his name was?  He was in an accident or something?  Yeah, yeah.  He came in late and he was wearing an eyepatch.  And we asked him what happened.  He said he got into an accident.  And as we questioned him, his story fell apart much like the owl-eyed runaway bride story.  It just crumbled under questioning. 
[02:34:00]  He said he was on a motorcycle.  When the motorcycle hit the car?  Yeah, yeah.  The motorcycle hit his car.  And the glass from the passenger window broke and some went in his eye.  And we're talking about how did the window break if the motorcycle hit the door?  And then he said, well, the guy kind of fell off the bike and his head hit the...  Yeah, I don't remember exactly.  But nothing went together.  But he was trying to claim he had glass in his eye and then he had kind of like abrasions  around his eye.  Yeah.  And then we finally got him to take the patch off. 
[02:34:30]  He kept saying, no, my doctor said, no, don't take it off.  Probably one of the most uncomfortable moments in Opie and Anthony history.  He took it off to reveal absolutely nothing was wrong with his eye or anything.  And then he's still trying to lie.  He's still working.  No, right here.  Look.  Right here.  You see?  Right here.  And well, the redness went away, but I still can't quite see.  And he was just lying through his teeth.  Just like the investigators with the runaway bride.  Yeah.  We're like, Brian.  Brian, there was no accident, right?  No accident. 
[02:35:00]  None, right?  And we actually fired him on the spot because it was like way too creepy.  Yeah.  That's different.  What this guy did was like.  Ah, Harry.  Harry's fine.  He'll stay here, but we'll look at him now a little different.  The Brian guy was creepy, though, because it was after he missed a couple days of work  or whatever.  The eye patch.  Harry's just a jizz bag.  Are you going to do that interview now?  Do we have them on the phone or what?  What do you got?  This is the Arrow.  I'm late.  I'm supposed to go 930, the Arrow.  They probably come off the air at 10.  Yeah. 
[02:35:30]  Right.  We'll just listen in.  Is that them?  Are they on?  Mm-hmm.  Huh?  Why are they saying what?  What?  What?  Hello.  But who the...  What's going on?  But where...  And then the...  But what happened?  Not yet.  Well, we...  Not yet.  He's on the phone with them.  Ben's on the phone with them right now.  Oh, Ben's on the phone talking.  Ben's doing an interview.  Well, my hog is quite huge.  Yes.  Frankly, thank you for asking.  Jim's at the State Theater and my hog is appearing at the...  That's great. 
[02:36:00]  Oh, he's coming back in?  I think we got Ben.  All right.  What's the problem?  Uh-oh.  You might have missed your...  They won't do it on there.  Why?  It's an infinity station.  So?  So what?  We're just listening.  We're not going to talk.  No.  They won't give us permission to do it.  Oh.  We're not going to listen to them.  We're just going to listen to him.  A one-way conversation.  Oh, you're going to do it on your cell phone?  Yeah, do the cell phone.  He can do it on a cell phone.  He can't do it...  Do it on your cell.  Yeah, just call him on your cell.  We'll do that.  All right.  Won't allow it. 
[02:36:30]  Infinity won't allow it.  No!  Because the intern's name was Brian, by the way.  I don't know.  Is that what you were asking?  Brian the intern, yeah.  Lion Brian.  Oh, Lion Brian.  Man, that worked out well.  All right.  Well, Jimmy's going to do an interview for a radio station down in D.C.  The Arrow.  The Arrow.  Classic rock.  It's a classic rock that really rocks.  Let's hear if Jimmy's personality changes.  Oh, no.  That's what I love about these.  If he puts on his, I'm on a different radio show.  No, I'm the exact same guy on both shows.  Is that who I'm doing it?  No, you're not.  Is that who he's doing it with?  Listen to how nice he is. 
[02:37:00]  Hi, this is Jim Norton.  I'm doing my phone-in.  How are you?  Okay.  I'm sorry I'm late.  The guys are on that way.  Okay.  Steven's in Medley.  Okay.  They're on their way.  Are we going to be live on the air?  Steven's in Medley.  Oh, this is a taped interview?  Yeah, it'll be right tomorrow morning.  Tomorrow morning they're running.  Okay.  Tomorrow morning?  Why do they have to do that?  Sure.  What are they doing now that's so important? 
[02:37:30]  They're off the air.  They're not off the air.  They're off the air at 10.  10 o'clock.  Oh, they're off the air at 9.  At 9?  Yeah.  5.30 to 9.  And they're still there?  Jeez, Opie.  Oh, shit.  What's that about?  What's going on?  They're taping things for tomorrow's show at 45 minutes after their show is over?  It's unheard of.  I'm already sleeping.  I am so home.  We might want to look into this work ethic then.  Yeah.  How you doing?  Perhaps.  Actually do stuff after the show. 
[02:38:00]  I didn't know you guys came off the air at 9.  I apologize.  I thought it was a 9.30 call.  I'm on the Opie and Anthony program.  Shut up.  God.  I am in the studio.  They do have very nice studios, yes.  Listen to them.  Fucking heck.  Where are you guys in D.C.?  All right, cool.  I know that this is going to be pre-taped for tomorrow morning, right?  All right, cool.  Can I say cunt?  Is that acceptable?  All right.  Let's get to your plugs. 
[02:38:30]  Just get this stupid interview over with.  Firing away at what?  I'm not sure what you mean.  Okay.  State Theater, 703-237-0300.  Hey, thanks, guys.  Take care.  I don't know.  No, it's not sold out.  It was sold out after the Stella Leno appearance.  But they actually reconfigured and added seats.  Speaking of sold out.  So, you know, come on down.  We're going to be giving away some tickets and shirts.  Yeah, hack it up. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah, hack it up.  You're the worst.  On the last Comic Standing thing, they didn't discover anything in my past at all.  That whole Megan's Law thing wasn't LOL.  No, it was actually a conflict with an MTV contract.  I had signed something with MTV, and I would have had to breach a Viacom contract.  I think they're asking him why he wasn't on the last Comic Standing thing.  Well, I do a lot of pedophile humor.  I don't know how long that would have lasted on NBC.  But, I mean, it was so far so good.  But I kind of knew I was going to have to leave in Vegas. 
[02:39:30]  What's that?  What Michael Jackson trial?  Oh, yeah.  They did a good job with that, actually.  Leno was very funny with the Michael Jackson.  Oh, God.  They're talking about the Michael Jackson trial?  That's good.  Can I get a bowl for you?  Yeah, I would have been very happy to do that, to just stand there shirtless in a little pair  of tight-fitting shorts, maybe a nice Viagra rod.  Can we say that on commercial?  I don't remember.  Okay, cool.  I don't remember.  You know, this job has ruined it for us. 
[02:40:00]  Good, things are great.  I mean, we're on XM, which is great because, you know, people can listen to you guys in  the morning and then listen to us in the afternoon or at night, whenever they want.  They replay us 24 hours.  And, you know.  Jimmy, he doesn't mean that.  Stop it.  It's phenomenal, dude.  It really is phenomenal.  We get a 24-hour replay.  We can say whatever we want.  And it's just great being back on the air.  We were off for 26 months, which sucked.  Raising brand crunch, Opie?  No, I just...  What do you got?  Granola.  It's been great. 
[02:40:30]  I mean, you know, we have...  You know, it's just getting better and better.  We're syndicated nationally now, which is just kind of weird to get calls from Oklahoma  and all these places.  And, you know, myself and Eric Nagel have just been on tour.  I mean, that's pretty much what we've been doing.  Yeah, I mean, I've done...  I'm doing Cleveland and then D.C.  I'm not doing too many cities, so I've got to go out and start shooting the series for  HBO in August.  I'm going out there.  It's the Eric Nagel Project, actually, which is on HBO.  We just don't know exactly.  That's what the working title is right now. 
[02:41:00]  Well, I'm not the star of it.  It couldn't be the Jim Norton Project.  Eric Nagel is this, like, he's this really weird guy.  He plays this, like, bisexual, incompetent radio guy, believe it or not.  And I know it sounds odd, but he's actually the star of the show.  So, I mean, you know, we'll see how it goes.  We start shooting in August.  We're shooting in L.A., so I actually have to go out to L.A. for a little while at Hawk Studios.  Yeah, so hopefully it'll be great.  Yeah, they're going good. 
[02:41:30]  Hey, I appreciate you guys having me on, too.  And I don't know how many D.C. fans, but my opening act is actually Don Geronimo's breath.  So if you guys can make it out for that, yeah.  And I'll be closing with a live dog running around the stage, and I'll pet it and love it and not kill it accidentally.  Was that a little?  You didn't like that one?  Are you guys going to come down?  Saturday night, yeah, man.  Go to Ticketmaster.com or whatever, or call the box office. 
[02:42:00]  That's what the whore does best.  You know, yeah.  I know, I really am.  My friend is telling me that I'm a whore, and I should do what the whore does best.  703-237-0300.  That's what I do.  I'm a plug whore.  I really am awful.  Oh, you know, I'll get, yeah, what a scumbag move that was.  I just invite these guys down and then tell them where they can buy tickets.  I really am a piece of shit. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, hey, guys, I'll be happy to give you CDs at cost.  I really am vermin.  Yeah, come down.  We'll make sure we have some tickets for you.  Oh, there you go.  Thank you guys for having me on, and I appreciate you being genuine and not cackling every two seconds like that.  Fucking Elliot.  What's wrong with that guy?  He wouldn't...  Are you guys friends with Elliot? 
[02:43:00]  Yeah, I'm sure it's a terrific show.  We've only heard it once.  We made fun of him, and he's pissed off and doesn't want to have me on, so fuck him.  Thank you guys.  Right now they're saying, well, they're telling us you got to go, Jim.  All right, well, thank you guys.  I really do.  I know you guys, they're saying you have to let me be, but I do appreciate it.  Thank you guys so much.  I'll see you Saturday.  I'll make sure they do that for you.  All right, bye. 
[02:43:30]  Wow, that went well.  This guy's very cool.  Were they okay?  Very cool.  Yeah.  But again, you know you're on a pre-tape, so you can have a little bit more freedom to talk.  What about the Don Geronimo?  They left.  Leave that in?  I hope so.  They're not on the same station.  The dead dog?  Yeah, why not?  Yeah.  I hope so.  Good, yeah.  Yeah.  We're going to have to listen now tomorrow.  We're going to have to have somebody listen and give a report.  Let's see if it'll sound a lot different.  Actually, I want somebody to call up tomorrow, and then we can listen to the whole interview.  They'll edit it differently.  And see what it sounds like.  Probably. 
[02:44:00]  See what was cut out.  That'll sound a lot different.  Yeah.  All right, we're going to break, and we'll talk about the transsexual cop next.  Also, Anthony, remember?  The hot, sexy stories.  We're talking about entrapment.  Put these cuffs on, Big Dick Daddy.  I don't want to go to jail.  You also talked about maximum exposure.  Yes, max, yes.  Where people are really getting fucked up, and the guy has a really crazy VO.  Yeah.  It's not appropriate.  But we'll get into that as well in a few minutes. 
[02:44:30]  So, stay there.  Hi, this is Jay Moore.  Hey, this is Chris Jericho.  This is Bernie Getz.  This is definitely Flavor Flavor on your radio.  This is Bill Burrow, the red-headed white boy from Chappelle Show.  This is Lois Griffin from Family Guy.  Hey, this is adult film star and former Guminatorial candidate, Mary Kay.  This is Jeffrey Ross.  Hey, this is Terry Jones here of Money Bible.  Hey, what up, y'all?  This is Tracy Morgan, a.k.a. Brian Fowles.  Hey, this is the game, Triple H.  This is your big baby girl, Patrice O'Neal.  How you, sweetie?  Hey, it's Colin Quinn.  This is Sam Cat Thomas. 
[02:45:00]  Hey, this is Sam Green.  Hey, this is Rich Voss from Last Comic Standing, season one and season three.  Hey, this is Tommy Chong.  Hey, this is Larry the Cable Guy.  Hey, this is R.C. Osborne.  And y'all listening to O.P. and Anthony.  I said you're smart.  You're not dumb.  Like people think.  Wake up!  Yeah, I'm so sick  I'm waiting for us to make a move. 
[02:45:30]  Wake up, wake up, wake up, and we will never lose.  Wake up, wake up, wake up, it's time to make a move.  Wake up, wake up, wake up, and we will never lose.  Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, make a move.  All right.  Stop fucking chewing into the microphone.  That's got to be the most annoying sound on the planet Earth. 
[02:46:00]  It is really bad.  People didn't like you eating your granola.  I took advantage of the fact that I didn't have to talk,  and I got to listen to Jimmy do an interview.  By the way, a bunch of dopes on the Instant Feedback saying,  we can't hear the person Jimmy's talking to.  Are you kidding me?  We explained that they didn't want their voices on the air.  Are you kidding me?  They really thought?  Well, we thought it would be fun just to listen in on what Jimmy was saying.  You could figure out what was being said. 
[02:46:30]  Jimmy.  This is good, man.  Are you calling Cleveland, too, today?  Not till 4.  Not till 4.  All right.  We can do a couple things here.  I'm already asleep by then.  What's up with the transsexual, by the way?  A Queens police officer has rocked the NYPD with an announcement that he is becoming a she,  the first known transsexual cop in New York City.  That's great around the station house, I'm sure.  Not too much, uh, not too many jokes going back and forth, I betcha. 
[02:47:00]  Oh, this is a complete lie.  Everyone, everyone's been very supportive.  Yeah, sure.  And I'm very happy about it, said a smiling officer, June Lowe.  Ugh.  Especially Billy Mac, he's letting me pilot his boat.  Who, until earlier this week, was known as Officer John Lowe.  And what's the name now?  June.  June.  They always make it similar to the, uh, the guy name.  I'm sure they're very supportive.  Yeah.  Too bad there's not a tape recorder rolling when you're not around. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  You know what's being said in the locker room?  It's taking courage, but I'm very pleased Lowe told the Post on the way to work last night  at the Queen's Transit Task Force, wearing a white sleeveless plouse.  That's great.  And cargo pants and sneakers, and hair in a ponytail.  That's fantastic.  When, where'd the tits come from?  The hormone treatment, I guess.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah. 
[02:48:00]  Because she's becoming a woman, that means she's been doing the hormones probably for a while.  That means the baloney boobs, and then eventually she gets the schlong cut off.  But he had, he, he's just making the changeover now to where, all right, I'm a chick.  Well, it's getting close, yeah.  Now it's getting close.  But there has to be the day where it was like, I come in in the male uniform, or the male clothes,  the guy clothes, and I go into the locker and put on the guy uniform.  It's got to be the day that he comes in in the women's clothing, and then changes into 
[02:48:30]  the girl uniform.  Well, you've got to wait for the hair to grow out a little bit.  Yeah, a little bit.  You've got to wait for the hair to get long, and you get that in a ponytail, and you're on your  way, I guess.  Got to wait for the hormones to take effect where your, I don't know, baloney, baloney  baloney tits start growing.  Start growing a little bit.  Declining to comment further, the 31-year-old Lowe said that, at some point in the future,  I will make a statement about the transition from man to woman.  Wow.  Lowe revealed the gender-bending decision Tuesday night during a roll call of Queens Transit 
[02:49:00]  Task Force cops.  When Lowe's name was called out by the sergeant, the cop asked to address the assembled officers  and was granted permission.  Everyone looked around at each other like, uh-oh, what's going on?  He said, this is the way things are now.  My name is June Lowe.  Lowe, I've legally changed it from John to June.  Lowe also told the other cops that she had been taking female hormones in preparation 
[02:49:30]  for undergoing surgery to completely become a woman.  Ugh.  Wow.  An ass.  Everyone's been very supportive.  No fucking way.  No way.  Of course not.  No fucking way.  And the department has no problem with this, right?  And there's some psychological issues that might have to be addressed.  Uh-huh.  The hormones have enabled the slight 5'4 Asian American officer to noticeably grow breasts 
[02:50:00]  over the past several months.  In addition to that change, officers have seen the freckle-faced Lowe grow fingernails and  hair long and wear earrings in both ears.  Hey, Lydia has a question.  Do you think he'll be charged with a fellow knee?  Liddy.  Fellow knee.  I get it.  Guy.  Sure.  Liddy sucks. 
[02:50:30]  So slowly but surely he's becoming a woman.  An Asian woman.  In front of everyone's eyes.  Is he undergoing an operation to have his ass removed?  Yes.  Other Asian women.  Put something that resembles a smile or a frown on that face.  He's got to like strap a board to his ass to flatten it out.  They just tighten the belts around there every week or so, make it tighter and tighter.  He's got a nice flat ass.  Wow.  Listen to this.  Oh, what?  Lowe told the other officers at roll call that if they had any questions about the process, 
[02:51:00]  they could either ask then or later privately.  The cops, most of whom were aware that Lowe was in the process of becoming a female, burst  into applause at the announcement by the eight-year veteran.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  Some guys asked, can we still call you J-Lo?  He said, yeah.  Said one cop, noting that Lowe had affectionately has been known by that nickname for some time.  J-Lo?  Mm-hmm.  They've been calling him, her, J-Lo for many years. 
[02:51:30]  Wow, that is just a weird story.  I bet you a few of those Irish cops had a little tranny dip.  A little dip?  I think so, like Nick Nolte from Q&A.  Don't pull my prick.  Don't let my prick pull and I'll do it myself.  Here's Keith the cop.  All right.  K-Lo, how you doing?  K-Lo.  What's up, K-Lo?  I'm just glad it wasn't my roll call.  That's all I got to say. 
[02:52:00]  Hey, does this cop, ironically enough, work in Queens?  This cop does, ironically, work in Queens.  You know, if you want to see what our perspective is from the officer's outlook,  do a quick, like a Google or something, put in NYPD rant.  Yeah.  And it gives us a message board.  We have our own message board.  And the second topic is Officer He-She.  Oh, really?  Let's go there.  Yeah, because that's bullshit. 
[02:52:30]  The paper's saying everyone has, she says or he says that everyone is supportive about this decision.  No offense, I love the NYPD and I've hung out with a lot of you guys.  I can't see them being supportive.  That's right.  No fucking way.  And I love tranny, so I'll cover it from that angle.  No way.  Dude, cops have that gallows humor.  They have to be fucking teasing this person constantly.  Oh, well, absolutely.  I would think so, you know.  It's something that, man, I don't know what I would have done if this guy would have, 
[02:53:00]  or this chick would have done that at my roll call.  I'd have been like, all right, there you go.  You might have met your partner.  Do you think the partner switched or requested a switch?  A switch?  What?  Like, is that some sort of joke?  No, no, I'm dead serious.  Like, to another partner.  Like, this is a little too weird.  No, no.  I don't know.  I tell you, I know some people that work over where he, she works, and I'm definitely looking  to get some stories today.  I'm sure.  Yeah.  And did you get that page?  Yeah, I got that page up.  Uh, let's see. 
[02:53:30]  As the NYPD digs itself deeper into the garbage society is creating, this is what you get.  Mark my words, give it a year, this officer will sue for discrimination on some part.  Any bets?  I wonder how the real women will react when J-Lo is pissing standing up in the women's room.  The woman's room.  Uh, what's that, Hung?  What?  That's a long post.  It says Hung, not anymore.  I don't know what the name was.  Uh, somebody will be hitting that after a club meeting. 
[02:54:00]  Well, you know what?  That's probably true.  Some guy will end up hitting it.  Oh.  Oh.  Uh, yeah.  Yeah, the cop's gotta be fucking irritated.  Now that he's becoming a she, she will get driven by a boss or get a cushy inside job such as stats.  Also on department forms, will it be P-O-M or P-O-F? 
[02:54:30]  P-O-M, P-O-F-E-M-A-L.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah.  Police officer tranny.  P-O-T.  Doesn't this raise some questions, though, Keith?  Aren't they going to have to, like, interview her now and see where she is psychologically?  Uh, you know, I would think that they're probably going to send it down for a quick psych services interview, maybe, you know.  Are you comfortable giving a gun to somebody that looks at their own cock and says, yuck, this has to be cut off?  It's a little frightening.  Well, I mean, you know, it's definitely a first. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah.  You know, I've chased trannies in the street, and they run pretty fast, but other than that, you know.  Do you hear me comment?  Yeah, well, you know, the shoes they wear tend to be uncomfortable, according to.  I chased one of them with, like, a six-foot-four black guy.  He ran like a gazelle, talking about three and a half blocks to catch him.  He had six-inch spiked heels on.  How did you finally catch him?  I think he tripped and fell down.  Oh, really?  I had no chance of catching him.  I think he tripped, and then he fell again on his face, again and again and again. 
[02:55:30]  He probably fell about 30 times, didn't he?  When I finally did end up getting the guy cuffed, I turned around, and there was a cop car from one of the task forces just sitting there laughing hysterical at me.  It's just, you know.  Funny.  They were in the car chasing me, chasing this tranny.  A little help?  Why didn't they help you?  Nah, because they were laughing too hard, you know.  I find it funny, man.  They were laughing at you chasing a tranny?  Funny's funny.  Screw helping them.  Let's watch how this turns out.  So, anyway, yeah, I'm sure as the day goes on, you'll get more and more of these comments. 
[02:56:00]  All right.  Oh, wait a minute.  If you refresh the board, Monster Rain PD has now entered the board.  Monster Rain PD.  The last person to post on it.  Tranny cop equals shit dick.  Wow, looks like some Opie and Anthony Linder.  Jesus, always ruining it.  What is it, NYPD rant?  Pests.  NYPD rant.  Well, go figure.  He actually has a post count of 69 already, so he's been around for a little while. 
[02:56:30]  Okay.  All right.  Thank you.  Thanks, Keith.  I'll be in tomorrow.  I'll see you guys later.  Good luck with the surgery.  Okay.  One of these posters brings up a good point.  It says, I wonder if on a psych oral exam, they asked a male, do you think or ever think  of becoming a female, changing your penis to a vagina?  If they said yes, if they would fail the psych examination.  I would think so, if they had that on there.  I guess since it's now acceptable in society to be a freak, you won't fail. 
[02:57:00]  But I bet 30 years ago, if you ask a male or female, do they ever think about switching  their gender, and they said yes, they'd be thrown out of the building.  Penis first.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, he says.  Wow.  It was a matter of time before a freak like this infiltrated the NYPD.  The guys laugh at the other guys for having a hairpiece to look good, but they applaud  a freak who goes from male to female or vice versa.  How sad this country has become.  Although, I will say, to play devil's advocate, if it doesn't affect your ability to be a good 
[02:57:30]  cop, then technically, hey, look, it's your own personal thing, do what you want.  I mean, if you could still be a good cop and be effective and make arrests.  Yeah, all I care about is that she, he, whatever, said, everybody was supportive.  I'm like, no way.  We know the NYPD.  Well, to your face.  And it's not just the NYPD.  You know, if it was somebody walking around here and decided to get that done, are we going  to be supportive?  We're going to be laughing our ass-eyed?  You think Boston cops?  I have an announcement to make.  We'll be laughing our asses off, and behind the scenes, it would be so ugly. 
[02:58:00]  We'd be fighting it.  That's just the reality of it.  The Opie and Antoinette show sounds stupid.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Guys, it'll just be like the old days.  Don't worry about it.  What a slut you'd be, though, if you're a guy and turned into a girl.  I wish you would.  I'd fuck you up right before the show.  Every day, I'd get you to blow me.  Every day, you're just fucking all the guys that you used to hang out with as a guy.  With an ugly chick with your goatee and hat, I'd still fuck you.  Just, you'd look exactly like you do now with tits under that, like, fucking shirt. 
[02:58:30]  Just cop a feel.  Not look me in the face.  Look up.  No, I'd look you right in the eye and just play with your nipple while you're doing a  Reagan impression.  Oh, well, fuck you now.  I'm not fucking you.  Jesus.  That would be funny if you gave ass to everyone in the studio but me.  Come on, dude.  What the fuck?  Oh, how bad would that make you feel?  Tommy.  There's a guy around that works with you, gets a sex change, he's fucking everybody  else, but not you.  The phones have exploded, guys. 
[02:59:00]  You think Boston cops aren't laughing at the NYPD right now?  Of course they are.  Tommy.  Yeah.  O&A.  Hey, Tommy.  Hey, man.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  What's up?  Little Jim.  Hey, Tommy.  A couple years ago, 10, 12 years ago, a friend of mine's brother got out on three quarters  and he got the change done.  He wasn't a bad guy, bro, but it was just weird, man.  He had to start calling him by his female name and everything.  Hello?  Yeah, could June have picked a shittier girl's name?  Yeah, what's Marla?  June. 
[02:59:30]  You went from Marla, his name was.  What?  Marla.  Marla.  What was his original name?  Yeah, sorry.  He blew his father's mind.  He went in and he told his father, you know, don't call me Mike no more and I guess they'll  call me Marla.  Mike.  Marla.  Oh, my God.  Marla.  The first thing his father was, all right, all right, Mike.  He just stuck to it, you know, but he had the tits and everything.  I would just say, look, I'm writing Mike on the suicide note, not writing Marla. 
[03:00:00]  He wasn't a bad dude, but, you know, he was an ugly motherfucker as a guy, though, so he  didn't, you know, and his sundress and panties and nail polish didn't really help him.  Well, there is a comedian that made the full switch.  Really?  Rick, I don't know if I can say his last name, but that's, I guess so.  Don't got him.  No, Rick don't got him.  We're talking about comedians.  Yeah.  No, he just peeled it back.  I know Rick Scotty, I believe, went through the full transformation.  Yeah.  I guess it's not a thing.  It's not a secret.  It is what it is.  What was the girl name? 
[03:00:30]  Don't know.  I haven't, I haven't, the last time I worked with him was in a place called Georgine's  in Pennsylvania, eight years ago.  Yeah.  I've heard that he made a full transformation.  Was he cute?  No, not really.  I mean, to my knowledge, he was a little bit of an older gentleman.  It wasn't bad.  It was just that it was weird, you know.  You knew the guy, he's his older brother.  We knew him my whole life, you know.  He dated ugly chicks all the time and stuff.  It was just weird when it happened, you know.  Freaked out my friend more than anything.  And it's even weirder when they are older and they do it.  Yeah.  If you're going to do it, do it young.  Yeah.  If you're going to do it, you know, try to be a hot, young piece of ass instead of like 
[03:01:00]  an old lady.  Like an old woman.  You got to go see your dad like, you've always known your dad as your dad.  You think, I can picture my father right now coming to me one day with that.  I would just hit him.  Yeah.  Imagine that's worse than a kid.  And say, look, dad, just tough it out.  That's worse than the kid coming to the father and saying, look, I want to become a woman.  And you get the guy that all of a sudden just says to his family, look, I want to be a  woman, has the sex change.  And now your dad is wearing that old gray wig and has tits. 
[03:01:30]  Mrs. Doubtfire.  Yeah.  Mrs. Doubtfire.  Boy, this guy has a kid, too.  He had a kid.  So after the change, he started going to the school to pick up his young daughter as a  woman in the dress and everything.  You don't know how to kid.  The kid's probably like 14 now, but it had to be a trip for the kid, too, you know.  All of a sudden, your dad's picking you up.  Then all of a sudden, your mom and dad is picking you up.  But, you know, it's real weird.  And these people always find, like, the worst dresses to wear.  Yeah, well.  They can't dress.  There's one that walks around on the Upper West Side. 
[03:02:00]  I'm like, yeah, silly goose.  Can't you get something a little better if you're going to walk around like a woman?  Not a lot of Ralph Lauren dresses.  No.  He was there for the girl I was seeing at the time where she got a panties from, and that's  a pretty shade of nail polish.  She just got real weird.  You know, they smoke at a joint with this guy, and all of a sudden, you know, you want your  cock.  It was just weird.  They all try to put on this girl's voice, too, that just comes off sounding like a guy.  He never tried that.  He still talks to this man's voice and stuff.  It was just weird.  But he had the big items out.  He was a short guy.  And, bro, he had a cock and a half on him, too. 
[03:02:30]  That's what killed him.  He was like five foot.  A cock and a half on him.  He tried to lay it on me, but you just know he had it.  Why would you want to lose all that goodness?  Did he have it chopped off?  Yeah, I said it.  If they do what they say they do, cut it in half and tuck it in, he ought to have the  deepest cuts around, bro.  Jesus.  For cock.  All right.  Thank you, Tommy.  Punch it out, boys.  There's so many people calling in.  Let's go to...  Tommy doesn't mince words.  No.  No.  Tommy's all right.  Let's go to Tony.  Go ahead, Tony.  Hey, how you doing?  He's a 15-year veteran in the NYPD. 
[03:03:00]  Hey.  This guy's got three things going for him already, if that's totally negative, all right?  First, he's a chick, all right?  On the NYPD, we already laughed at that.  The second thing, he's a fan.  The third thing, he's going to get his dick chopped off.  I mean, come on.  It's like everything that every fucking cop has gone against.  Everything.  I mean, I can't see these guys clapping at a roll call.  All I can see is them clapping, going downstairs into the locker room, and rolling on the floor  fucking laughing and pissing themselves.  Of course.  I mean, they're animals. 
[03:03:30]  This guy's a fucking animal.  How do you fucking stand next to somebody like that and go, oh, you're going to save my  life?  Yeah, you're going to run into a fucking, you know, into gunfire for me.  You know, you want to chuck your dick off?  Believe me, June Lowe's going to have her face trapped in a door like Serpico.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  James, by the way, great job over there.  And guys, listen, I'm going to punch you out.  Have a nice day.  Bye, mister.  Thank you, Tony.  Fonzo, listen to this one.  Fonzo, go ahead.  Hey, Fonzo.  I used to be an intern at WBAI.  That's the public radio station there in New York. 
[03:04:00]  It is?  Yeah.  And the news director at the time was named David Sears.  And he was this sort of weird dude, a little feminine.  I left the station and I checked in months later listening to the news.  And all of a sudden, the same guy doing the news on the radio is now Andrea Sears.  And I Googled him or something.  And sure enough, he showed up to work one day as a woman.  And is now a woman.  And now a chick, right?  Yep.  Weird guy.  Damn.  All right.  Punch it out. 
[03:04:30]  Has anyone ever been able to pull that off?  Let me think.  There was a Bond woman that used to be a man.  Tula.  Tula.  Remember Tula?  And she was in Playboy and all that?  Yeah, she was in Playboy.  And she was actually a Bond woman?  Yeah, she was a Bond chick.  One of the helicopter pilots in one of the movies.  I don't even remember which one.  And it turned out, yeah, she was a guy at some point.  Underwent the operation.  There's just something manly about them that you kind of like, no matter how hot they are 
[03:05:00]  or anything, you're just like, eh, you know.  I assume you can't get rid of the man's smell.  Oh!  You got everything else just perfect.  You got nice pointy boobies.  Can you deodorize me?  And the vag looks, you know, good.  You got a great doctor.  And you got to put that man's smell.  The musky man-ass.  It's just not going away.  You're not turning that into a chick's bottom? 
[03:05:30]  No.  Yeah.  I don't know.  All right, good luck to you, officer.  Well, there's a couple more here.  New Jersey, what's up?  Bro.  Yo.  Hey, we're talking to you.  Go.  How's it going?  Yeah, I had a pediatrician down in South Jersey here.  He got the full change, went from Carlos to Carla.  Years back, it was a big deal down here, too.  That's too funny.  Because he had left.  He got a grant from a hospital for some sort of clinic he opened. 
[03:06:00]  And then they pulled his grant after the change.  So they went and sued him and everything.  I'm laughing at the distant fart that I just heard.  Yeah, distant.  Here's a picture of Tula.  All right, thanks, bro.  No, bro.  Who's Tula?  Tula used to be a guy.  Tula's not that bad.  From here.  From here.  His name, Barry Kenneth.  Cossie.  God, that's awful.  And then you could see, like, the implants kind of made the boobies look a little weird. 
[03:06:30]  Right there.  And then there's Bush.  It's a great body, though.  Well, you know.  And I mean Ope.  I'm not leaning over anymore.  Jesus.  The, um, I've hooked up with a couple of ladies of the evening who were women, who  I, I, I got a weird suspected thing were post-ops.  I had a couple that I had sex with that I just, something about it felt wrong.  I don't know what it was.  Are you kidding me?  No, no, no.  But you can never tell.  It looks real.  It looks natural.  I would think you'd be able to tell. 
[03:07:00]  It's kind of like going to a Chinese restaurant and you get one of those chicken dishes and  it looks like chicken, but the taste is just a little off.  Something wrong.  You can just feel it.  Even with a condom in order that you can still feel like something was not, I don't  know.  Maybe it's an instinct.  Maybe we have a weird base instinct.  Oh my God.  What?  Yeah.  You just talk about it like so.  Something just felt wrong.  Like the whiskers on your chin.  No, no, no.  No, I mean it was just the way you talk about it.  And I look at each other like we have no, nothing to answer that. 
[03:07:30]  You know why?  You know why?  Anybody, any girl I've ever, ever had sex with, I know is a girl.  A girl has been a girl their whole lives.  You've never ever sat there and went, yeah.  Something's just wrong about this.  There's never been an instance where I had to ponder, they could have been a guy at one  point.  Well, you know what it is though, dude.  Don't forget.  I mean, I'm in the trenches.  Yes, you are.  There's some walking into a lot of strange apartments.  You certainly are.  Meeting a lot of gals.  And a couple of them, there was one who I contacted who I just talked to and realized 
[03:08:00]  this is a post-op and I didn't do it.  But a couple, it was almost like I didn't know what was wrong and then after.  And I could have been wrong, but it's just a weird vibe.  It's nothing that you could look at and see.  All right.  It's something.  Let's go to Ziggy in Jersey.  Ziggy, what's up?  Yeah, how you doing, guys?  A couple of years ago, there was this thing in Hoboken, one of the lieutenants or captains  went on vacation and came back a female.  Went on vacation in Hoboken.  Yeah, in Hoboken. 
[03:08:30]  That was about five or six years ago.  Did he tell anyone he was doing it?  He went on vacation and came back as a female.  Didn't came back as a male no more.  Moboken.  Yeah, in Hoboken.  They wanted to fire him and did a whole bunch of other stuff.  He was throwing the lawsuits against the Hoboken TD.  So it was not far from New York, you know?  Man, I just don't understand the reasoning and the thinking to do that to yourself.  Well, that is something. 
[03:09:00]  Let's say hi to Juliana.  Juliana, what's up?  Mm-hmm.  Juliana.  Hello?  You.  Me?  Yes.  What's your name?  I'm not Juliana.  I'm Steve.  Oh, you know what?  I fucked up.  That wasn't my fault.  He is on Steve.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead, Steve.  Maybe he had a sex change.  That scared me a little bit.  What's going on, Steve?  Sorry, Steve.  Go ahead.  Well, Jimmy never ceases to amaze me.  I'd be really terrified to share a cup of coffee with him.  No, but I'm not saying there was anything that tipped me off. 
[03:09:30]  I just, like, in a hindsight thing, there was something off that I couldn't, you know,  couldn't put my finger in it.  I just threw it, but it was just something.  Well, what I'm calling about is that if I were Anthony, I'd be a little bit weird out being in the bathroom with James because he, these fantasies are falling off of his tongue a little bit too quickly about you.  Oh, I'm not having a sex change.  So I have nothing to worry about.  Take care, guys.  All right.  Now we'll go to Juliana.  Juliana.  Hi.  How are you guys doing today?  Pretty good. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah.  Well, no, I had a friend of mine.  He showed up at my house at the time.  I didn't know he was in drag.  And, I mean, he looked good, you know.  But we went to a drag queen contest in Florida.  And, you know, I was trying to suggest to these guys, you know, you need to lower the boobs a little bit, not have them so high up on your chest.  They lost their freaking mind.  Guys that are drag queens, all this stuff.  But, I mean, to me, like, whatever you do.  But if you want to have your dick cut off, like, there's something so basically human and wrong with that. 
[03:10:30]  And it's just completely against nature.  And I'm not saying that they're shitheads, but, I mean, people that really want to do that.  It's like, what is going on internally that you want to have your dick removed?  There are people that have amputation fetishes where they want to have limbs amputated because they feel like the left leg or the right arm is wrong.  It doesn't belong there.  It has to be removed.  And there are guys that will actively seek someone to remove a healthy limb.  And they want it gone forever.  It's like maybe it's the same type of a thing. 
[03:11:00]  So instead of saying that it's an absolutely acceptable thing, maybe there's a sickness there.  I don't know, but, you know, it just doesn't seem normal to want your dick removed.  All right, Tim, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  Hey.  When I was in college, we had a tranny working down the street at the Cumberland Park.  What college?  Roger Williams University.  And we used to call her Uncle Rachel because she was about 6'4 and 250 pounds.  Uncle Rachel.  And would wear miniskirts.  And it was pretty nasty with her big, thick legs sticking out of the bottom of the miniskirts. 
[03:11:30]  And she'd try to act all dainty and try to talk all soft.  And she'd go to him and do a change.  She'd go, here's your change.  And everybody would just kind of guide the hand away from hers and let her put the change on the counter.  All right.  Thank you, Tim.  Bye.  No problem.  Let's go to Tony in Virginia.  Tony.  Hey, guy.  That music that you play from the beginning of The Shining, that was done by Walter Carlos, now Wendy Carlos.  Yeah, I was just looking at that. 
[03:12:00]  I had no idea.  In the internet movie database.  Have you seen a picture of her?  She looks horrific.  Wendy Carlos used to be Walter Carlos.  She looks awful.  And scored The Shining.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  And decided, you know, to become a woman.  Hey, is that the same?  You can't tell.  Wait a minute.  The person that did the music from Clockwork Orange.  Yep.  That was Walter Carlos.  Oh, same person.  Okay.  Before the dick came off.  I heard that that was a switch.  Okay.  So, same person.  Kubrick must have loved using this person.  Looks terrible.  Doesn't matter.  Great music.  Yeah, definitely.  Definitely.  I got a bunch of albums.  You can cut my dick off if I can do soundtracks like that.  Am I right or wrong, guys? 
[03:12:30]  Huh?  Seriously.  Let's say hi to Joey Diaz, a new friend of the show.  Joey, what's up?  You want to cut your dick off, Doc?  First of all...  Mom says I'm not a supposed to.  Is this Joey?  Joey, our friend Joey?  Yeah, a comic?  Yeah, what's up, Joey?  What's happening, baby?  Hey, man.  I seen you on the couch.  And I show you a fucking animal.  You understand me?  Oh, thanks, man.  I laugh my ass off.  I'm in Dallas.  And I get no Jim Norton stories down here.  I'm ready to fucking mug a transvestite.  You understand me?  What's going on down there?  Nothing.  I'm doing...  I'm at the Improv.  But I figured I'd come down here and get a good Jim Norton story. 
[03:13:00]  I didn't do anything when I was down there, dude.  I just kind of hung out.  It was a very slow week.  I didn't get laid.  I didn't hook up at all.  No fucking hookers?  No nothing?  Dude, I wanted to go...  I heard down there in Dallas.  Someone said...  I think my pugs told me that there was a...  You know, they have all those, like, brothels.  Some pimp broke into a brothel down there, shot the guy at the desk, then killed the hooker  who used to work for him, and killed her, John.  So I've always been afraid of going into those places.  Then fuck it.  No, no word.  Last time I was here, I mugged the stripper, though.  They were all looking forward to you coming.  No, I'm ready.  I'm down here. 
[03:13:30]  I'm looking forward to fucking seeing you in New York, man.  But you were great, and I was listening to the show.  You were killing me today.  Oh, thanks.  With your transvestite, a cop who wants to cut his dick off.  I don't get it either, bro.  You can't be a cop if you cut your dick off.  You can be, but just how effective.  Yeah, it makes...  If you got a dick, you can't shoot nobody.  You're walking around confused.  It's like drinking fucking vodka and that shit, that fucking energy drink.  Red Bull.  Red Bull.  Yeah, possible.  You know, but that's it.  I'm just checking in, baby.  Say hello to the boys.  All right, Joey. 
[03:14:00]  We'll see you next time you're in New York.  Thank you, my man.  Bye, Angel.  There he goes.  Joey Diaz playing the improv down there in Dallas this weekend.  You're a funny bastard, man.  The fucking Addison improv.  All right.  Want to take a break?  Yeah, you want a shoulder rub?  Ooh, that'd be nice.  Making everyone uncomfortable.  Why?  The fuck?  I just, I was hoping for an applause.  Hello?  Hey.  Cigars and scotch.  Hey, Cigars and scotch.  Oh, what's up, man?  Is that a baby around you? 
[03:14:30]  Yeah, I'm a stay-at-home mom.  Oh.  Is that what you do?  You just, like, change the baby and do those great photoshops all day?  Yeah.  I know.  I've seen some sick shit this guy's done.  You're an animal, dude.  We love your stuff.  Thanks.  When I worked in Kings County Hospital, we had a transvestite resident.  Oh, yeah?  A surgical resident.  We were level one trauma.  People would get into an accident, wake up in the ICU, and we had this thing called Melanie.  Looks like Barney Rubble in a dress with red hair.  Jesus.  Horrific. 
[03:15:00]  Yeah, some of them are really atrocious.  And then once in a while, you got to double take.  Like, holy Christ.  I heard in Rio, I was so paranoid in Rio de Janeiro about trans.  Because that's, like, the capital of the world for operations.  There was a lot of girls I didn't hook up with because I'm like, ah, that's too risky.  And Patrice told me, you're nuts.  I'm like, ah, I don't know.  I don't trust it.  So I think I made the right move.  Yeah, there was no mistaking this one, though.  Oof.  All right.  Thank you, bro.  Bye, sweetie.  Bye, baby.  Why is Ben Stein hanging out with the president? 
[03:15:30]  Well, he was a Nixon speechwriter.  I mean.  He stinks.  I like Benny.  Oh, I hate him.  I know.  We fucking hate him.  Bastard.  All right.  Why don't we take a break, and we'll continue with the O.P. and Anthony program.  There is nothing quite like a Cuban cigar.  Right, Ramon?  The rich texture.  The full flavor.  So relaxing.  Oh, fiddlesticks.  No ashtray.  Ramon, open your mouth. 
[03:16:00]  All right.  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony program.  Tomorrow on the program, we're going to try the girl thing again. 
[03:16:30]  Hopefully, hopefully we'll have better luck than the last time.  We better, because there's a band right now.  There's a girl band in this studio, and we're breaking it tomorrow to test out some new gear  here in the studio.  To break in the liberators.  The liberator.  We've got a couple of these liberator things around, and I guess girls are coming in tomorrow,  and they're going to demonstrate how many cool positions you can get into with these liberators. 
[03:17:00]  Comfy positions.  And we don't want any crap.  We want these girls to come in and have a good time.  No arguing.  No clothing.  No second-guessing our suggestions.  They are to come in.  One is going to strap on a dildo and act like the man, and the other one is going to receive.  They're going to use the liberator.  And that's the way it's going down. 
[03:17:30]  If it doesn't go down that way, within one second, they will be out of this studio.  That is the gift we now give our listeners.  No more bullshit.  All right.  Let's go to Jimmy in Ohio.  Jimmy.  Oh, you were talking about someone becoming a tranny in the office there.  I was wondering, how big do you think Ben's badge would be if he had that hog turned inside out?  Harrison Ford would accidentally land the Millennium Falcon in it. 
[03:18:00]  Hey, Jimmy.  I've got a question about Liddy there.  How does he feel about being on XM Radio now?  I heard that G. Gordon is going to be on.  Yeah, well, I kind of like being on XM.  Oh, God, could that bid end, please?  Let's say hi to Erin in New York City.  Erin?  Yeah, hello.  What's up?  How much?  Yeah, I've considered having surgery.  Why?  What are you?  I'm a woman.  You're a woman. 
[03:18:30]  You sound like a 16-year-old boy.  Yeah, I know.  I don't know.  I've got a really female voice.  How old are you?  I'm 22.  You're 22, and you're a lesbian?  Yes.  But you're not lipstick, right?  You're kind of dyst.  No, no, no.  Yeah, yeah.  How big would your mule be if they made you a mule?  They make it actually really small.  That's why I'm not sure if I'm going to go through with the whole thing, because they  stretch your clitoris.  Do you know how awful that would look?  Would it get hard? 
[03:19:00]  Yeah, they have something that they install where you do get hard.  Yeah, but it's like that pneumatic thing where you...  You've got to pump it up or something?  You've got to pump it.  I think it has something to do with pumping up.  I'm not completely sure.  My friend's getting the operation in a couple of months.  I heard what they do is they take flesh from other regions and then put the clit kind of  where the sensitive parts of the penis would be, but it's not just stretching your clit.  It's kind of like using tissue from around other areas and building a penis. 
[03:19:30]  And then, you know, like the underside of your dick or something, they would put the clitoral  nerves right there and kind of put a pump in there and make a fake sack out of the labia  and then put a couple of Teflon balls in there and then you screw away with that.  Why don't you just be happy that you are who you are?  Wow, Jimmy.  I'm not completely sure what I'm going to do, but I don't know. 
[03:20:00]  I just don't feel right, I don't know, being a lady, I guess.  And it's kind of easier, you know, as far as getting a job just to pass.  You know, I just consider just taking hormones.  Yeah.  Because that does a lot.  Like, you can't even tell.  Did your titties go away?  Yeah, they would.  I haven't taken them, but they would.  Oh.  And you really want to do this, huh?  I'm not completely sure, but I'm looking into it.  I mean, obviously, my family wouldn't be too cool with it. 
[03:20:30]  So, I don't know.  You like girls, though?  You like being with women?  Yeah, I do.  And you haven't been with a guy?  No, I've never been with a guy.  Never?  No.  Does it just repulse you?  It doesn't repulse.  I guess, like, having, like, intercourse, yeah, that kind of repulses me.  Yeah?  Would you grow, like, facial hair and stuff?  You can, yeah.  They all do.  Any of the women that go to be men, they take the hormones, and they always grow the beard  and mustache thing, just to, like, look at me. 
[03:21:00]  Someone's bringing up a good point on line one.  Tom in Jersey says, if you add a dick to yourself, the dykes won't want you.  Is that true?  What?  What?  If you add a cock, the dykes won't want you.  Um.  So then what?  I don't know.  I would just, I don't know.  I guess that'd be cool.  I haven't, I don't, I don't.  I think you would, I don't know.  I think your choices would be drastically reduced.  Are you able to have orgasms?  Yeah.  So why would you want to mess with something that feels good? 
[03:21:30]  That's what I meant, like, if it's.  Well, I don't get, I don't get, I don't get the orgasms from, uh, from, uh, going inside.  No, no, no.  But from, from, from masturbation you do?  Yeah, I do.  So why mess with your generals?  I, it's interesting, I'm not even completely sure that I would go all the way, you know,  just because that part kind of scares me.  Oh my God.  But, uh, I would, I mean, my circle's pretty, like, you know, if, if I, if I came up to my  friends and said I was transgender and said, yeah, you know, I want to do this, but not  all the way, I mean, they'd be cool with it.  And there's, like, a lot of girls that are just into that, you know? 
[03:22:00]  I say just, just eat as much pussy as you can and masturbate.  What's wrong with that?  Yeah.  Yeah, aren't you afraid you're not going to be able to, like,  really satisfy yourself sexually?  Everything goes wrong and all of a sudden now you're...  Yeah, that's a fear.  That's why I don't know if I would get the bottom part done.  I mean, if anything, I'd get the top.  You want to pull down, you want to pull down a constructed part?  Like, to masturbate as a man, it's like, you know, it's a ferocious activity.  It really is.  It's not, it's not like the little, the little middle finger that you rub with. 
[03:22:30]  There's a fist involved in this.  I'm amazed mine doesn't break apart at times.  Dude, my dick is...  You're so right.  No lube, I just grab it under the head.  You'll pound.  You'll whack it and stretching and pulling.  It's horrendous.  You'll stick it in between cushions.  You just bat, like, like, if you would pound your fist on a table.  Yeah.  It's that type of violence.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:23:00]  Yeah, see, I'm not sure about that, but...  You got big boobs?  Um, that are, like, C36s.  36C's, nice.  How about, now how about, not to be personal, how about your badge?  Is it big or small?  It's big.  Really?  Yeah, it is.  Really?  Yeah, it's...  Roomie.  How big?  Like, I mean, puffy?  Well, yeah, it's like, it's pretty big.  Like, I mean, it's like bigger than other girls that I've seen, so...  Are you a big girl?  Oh, yeah, I am.  Yeah, I can tell.  Can I see a picture of it? 
[03:23:30]  Uh, no, because you guys make fun of me.  No, I won't.  I actually want to see a picture of your badge, because if you email it to me, I know somebody  at Johns Hopkins who does this kind of surgery, and I would give you honest feedback.  I promise not to whack my bag looking at your badge picture.  From a picture.  I like that.  Yeah, so...  What can you do with this?  Yeah.  All right, so...  I only learned that from Charleston Labs.  There are three major centers for sexual reassignment.  And Johns Hopkins, and I can't remember the other ones. 
[03:24:00]  All right, Aaron, good luck becoming a man, I guess.  All right.  Any other questions?  Let us know when you're Eric.  Yeah, bye, Aaron.  Because she's going to change her name to Eric, I bet.  All right, bye.  Speaking of Aaron, my ex-girlfriend calls me while we're on the air, and then I try to  call her back, and she doesn't pick her up.  Yeah, she doesn't pick the phone up.  She's riding around.  She loves the ice cream child molesting bit.  Doesn't she realize what time it is that you're working?  Yes.  She's out of her mind, though.  She's a kook.  Let's go to John in Modesto.  John?  Hey, yeah. 
[03:24:30]  Hey, when I was in the Navy, I was stationed at the military police back in Naples, and  you get the Gator freighters with all these friggin' jarheads pulling into port, and they  go down there picking up the trannies.  So we go down there and patrol, friggin' watching out for this crap.  And we had this one tranny flag us down, just bullshitting with it.  And drops the dress, brags about going to Florida, getting everything hacked off, and you couldn't  tell it was a friggin' dude.  And no one bagger, no beer, straight up sober.  It's like, holy shit.  And then you get the one that the one that the tranny friggin' shot the jarhead when he 
[03:25:00]  did a reach-around, found something he wasn't looking for, friggin' got hit in the leg with  a .22.  Funny as hell.  Wait, who got shot?  A jarhead Marine.  Why'd the Marine get shot?  Well, he reached around, and he found a cock on the chick, didn't know that was there.  He gets pissed, and then starts beating on her, so she pulls out a little .22 and shoots  him in the calf.  Oh.  That was kind of funny.  We should have killed him.  When you start out during the day, you get the tranny that don't have anything done.  It's just a dude in a friggin' dress. 
[03:25:30]  And then later on, you get the ones with the chicks with dicks.  And we'd go patrol, and they'd pick us out of the crowd while we're driving around in  uniform, and they'd open up their dress.  They're there in a nightie, winging their friggin' dick at you.  That was funny as hell.  Yeah, that's really awful.  What streets?  No, I mean, I want to avoid those streets.  All right, thanks.  Let's see.  Let's say hi to Chris the trucker.  Chris?  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, Chris.  Hey, first off, love you guys.  Jim, you're a goddamn good comedian.  I respect you.  Thank you, mister. 
[03:26:00]  Anyway, this girl I was dating back in high school, Melissa.  I popped her cherry when she was 16.  I was 17.  I wind up playing football at Kansas State.  She's going to UCLA.  I was about 22 at the time when I found out that she had turned into a man.  She's now Michael.  Michael.  I could take these calls all day.  It's just so weird.  Oh, dude, you want to talk about insecurities?  Oh, my God.  I was fucking anything with a cunt, dude.  I was absolutely sticking my dick wherever it would go.  You turned your chick into a man. 
[03:26:30]  So what?  Just because you're so awful in bed, they change genders?  I mean, that's not a big deal.  I never want another cock in me.  It was just that my cock was so wonderful for her that she couldn't stand to not have  one of her own, I guess.  You know that?  I'm telling myself that I'm drunk.  Well, tell yourself this.  You were so awful at it.  She's like, Jesus, I can do this.  All right, Chris, thanks.  This guy has a question for Professor Anthony.  Timmy in Wisconsin.  Hey, what's happening?  I'm you and Anthony. 
[03:27:00]  What up, Timmy?  Hey, Blinky, how you doing?  Good.  I got a question for Professor Anthony.  Yes, I'll see if I can help you.  Well, I'm wondering if a chick becomes a man, will she have her period out of her dickhole?  Of course not, sir.  In order to have a period, a woman needs ovaries and a uterus.  Of course not.  Thanks a lot.  That helped me great.  This thing installed those.  That helped you out?  Yeah, thank you.  Although I did just read a story that in India, I believe it was, a 14-year-old boy has been 
[03:27:30]  getting a period every month, he has some hormonal changes, and he bleeds every month.  They didn't say in the article exactly where, but I would assume from the pee hole, but that  doesn't make any sense, because that has nothing to do with the...  Maybe that's kidney stones.  They're trying to say it's a period?  Yeah, it's a period, is what they're saying. 
[03:28:00]  Very odd.  I'll say.  Any of those stories from India, Korea, Japan, even England, I don't believe them.  All right, we'll wrap up this discussion with this little ditty from Stephen Lynch.  We have half of what you see and none of what you hear.  Good point, Ant!  She's part girl, she's part boy, she's got parts everyone can enjoy. 
[03:28:30]  She's got more, she's got less, she's got her manhood tucked in her dress, yeah.  Is she a mister or is she a miss?  Does she stand up when she's taking a piss?  She's my little girl, she's my little guy.  When I try to please her, I get poked in the eye, yeah. 
[03:29:00]  She wears lace and she wears flannel.  She watches football and the Lifetime Channel.  What's that bulge under her nightie?  It's just my hermaphrodite, yeah.  Some things are white, some things are black. 
[03:29:30]  Some girls wear makeup, mine shaves her back.  She is still beautiful, she is still fine.  It's too bad her package is bigger than mine, yeah.  She looks like Cher, but she's built like Sonny.  She loves Brad Pitt and finds the Three Stooges funny.  Who's that girl with the grip so mighty? 
[03:30:00]  It's just my hermaphrodite, yeah.  Hermaphrodite, hermaphrodite, hermaphrodite, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Woo!  You've got to be kidding me.  Ah, there he is.  Steven Lynch.  Huh? 
[03:30:30]  Get off the Liberator, Jimmy.  Yeah, Jim.  What?  I thought we were taking a break  You smell like gas or I cut  We go to take a break  And Jimmy reclined on the liberator  That's right  He goes Ben come over here I want to try out a few positions  I want to try out number 47  With Ben's cock I did positions 11 through 38  At once  It's funny Ben's cock will liberate you  From your innards  Alright 
[03:31:00]  You want to try this maximum exposure  We did talk about this down the road  Jimmy's phone is ringing like crazy  Jimmy who's that  Hold on this is my ex girlfriend  I'm like I'm on the air  She's like you are  You were listening to the show  You got the strangest relationship with your ex  I know  It's really strange  She's an odd girl  She's a very odd girl  But we love her

MXC  MXC  Wow, they're screaming  Wow  At Eric from the other room  Yeah, they get very competitive  Now they're going to really go for it  With the cut the cucumber  On the throat trick  Double clutch 
[03:35:30]  And he's bleeding  The trusting assistant  Keeps it together  But then he collapses  Let's take a closer look  The master starts his downward stroke  He hesitates  The second stroke splits  His trusting assistant's throat open  Hi  It's pretty calm  For a guy with a gaping wound  In his throat  And the master's really cool  As he ignores the bleeding dude 
[03:36:00]  Thanks for nothing, master  Zoom in on it  The master casually wipes  The blood off his sword  He don't want to get his sword dirty  His trusting assistant's taken off  The bleed somewhere else  I saw that one  Oh, hard to watch  The samurai guy?  Put a cucumber on his assistant's neck  Yeah  And then takes a samurai sword  And goes to slice the cucumber  And he did it  And hit the throat  Holy crap  Did the guy die? 
[03:36:30]  No  Can we get a video of that?  Like DVD?  I'm sure it's somewhere  Online  But yeah  They showed some pretty fucked up stuff  On Max X  When did you get that hat?

[03:39:00]  And one of their bits included performing a rock song parody in the guise of ultra-Orthodox Jews  Just that didn't pan out  I thought maybe New York City comedy comedian, maybe Jimmy knew him  Never heard of him  Speaking of shit  My iPod, I cannot even get my songs to come up on now 
[03:39:30]  I hate this fucking product  No?  Dude, it registers that I have gigabytes missing of memory  But the songs won't come up  So I have nothing on my iPod  It's two months old  Almost 400 bucks  I hate it  So it shows that your hard drive has stuff on it  And when I plug it into the computer, I can see what's on the iPod  So it's in there  Yeah  I just can't bring it up to listen to it  You're going to have to reboot it  I don't know how to 
[03:40:00]  I can't reset  I hit the menu and the play button for the reset  No, no  It doesn't reset  Two fingers in the middle  Two fingers  Two buttons in the middle  Yeah, right  You keep telling yourself that  That's the way you reboot it  I guarantee you it won't reboot  I just reboot it  The one in the middle of the swirly round thing?  Yeah  You hold that down  Hold that down for a few seconds  You actually turn it off  Hold it and then turn it on  And hold it down  And rotate in a circle to the left  No, Albie, that's confusing  Bring it in, we'll fix it  Yeah, I'll fix it for you  Oh, the devil doesn't like his iPod  Are you making fun of my devil voice? 
[03:40:30]  No, I was trying to do it  I don't know if you'll fix it  It's just one of my bits  That I like to do from time to time  I hate the iPod  I tried, guys  You really did  I tried  I wanted to love it  I hope he has one  He skateboards around with it  He looks delicious  Skateboards  I wanted to have an iPod  Working out, getting in shape  I gotta be honest with you  I have given up on the iPod in recent months  It stinks  I'm all about the MiFi  How are the MP3 players? 
[03:41:00]  I have to put music on  Are they good?  Those are great  Do they break down like these fucking iPods?  You never know  They're all a little squirrely at times  But then I bought the Bose system that the iPod hooks up to  That rocks  Can you put a regular MP3 player in there too?  No, it's only for an iPod  I think they're specifically for iPods  The Bose system  The Bose system where you've docked the iPod  The speakers on the side  Oh my god  Those things are great  Yeah, but what am I going to do with it now?  I'm all about the MiFi now, man  I just record channels while we're on the air  And then you never know what you're recording 
[03:41:30]  But you know it's in the genre you like  And you've got a nice little surprise every day  Like, oh wow, look what song they're playing today  That I wouldn't have thought of  I know, I've got to have my  It's great  And then you play the songs you want  You go, alright, I'll play this one by Nirvana  And then I'll go to this one  And then I'll go to that  Whatever  And the only iPod store is in fucking Soho  Why?  Bring it in, Jimmy  I don't want to bring it in  It's going to take a week to get fixed  How about a new one?  Dude, Steve will fix it in two minutes  Just bring it in  I bet you don't even know how to reboot it 
[03:42:00]  Yeah, I'll take a look at it  It's a piece of shit  I reboot mine every day before I go to the gym  It just, you know  Hire someone to sing for you while you're working out  That's easier than a fucking iPod  It's terrible  It's fucking terrible  Why don't you get one of these?  These are great  Look what Ben's got  Mini iPod?  What do you got?  Four songs on that thing?  What is it?  No, Ben's got a  What is that?  The Shuffle or whatever it's called?  It's 120  I have a Shuffle  HBO gave me one  I won't even open the package  It's weird though  Because you don't know what songs are  That's what's good though  Exactly, it's not good  I don't want surprises  You throw 120 songs on the Shuffle 
[03:42:30]  And then you don't know what's going to come up  120 songs?  I need more than that  I like to listen to a whole album  I have a regular one too  I rotate and then I get the Mi5  Do you have one, Ant?  Yeah, I do  Has it broken down already?  I haven't used it in a while though  Okay  Yeah  Ops has had problems  Ben, you've gone through a few, right?  Yeah, I've had problems with them  Everyone's had problems  With this piece of shit technology  Fix it  Jim, Doug is saying on the line  Just update the firmware  And you'll be fine  What is firmware?  I have no idea  It's brand new
