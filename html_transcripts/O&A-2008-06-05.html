<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with excited promotion of their sold-out Animation Festival at Roseland Ballroom (animationfest.net), highlighting the high-quality, albeit late, listener-submitted animations.  Jimmy's iPhone woes and subsequent humorous Apple Store experience, including an unexpected encounter with Colin Quinn, were discussed, alongside speculation about the upcoming iPhone release.  Hillary Clinton's withdrawal from the presidential race and John McCain's health were subjects of comedic speculation, leading to predictions about Barack Obama's potential presidency.  A caller then initiated a convoluted discussion about the Bilderberg Group.

Anthony's relationship with Jill Nicolini ("Anthelini"), including their anniversary, Nashville trip, and various humorous anecdotes, dominated a significant portion, with in-studio guest Patrice O'Neal offering relationship advice.  O'Neal's unique perspective on relationships was highlighted, prompting suggestions for a book. Anthony Cumia's country music sing-along album was also promoted, and Perry White (mistakenly introduced as Perry Mason) was mentioned as a guest.  Opie commented on Anthony's evolving fashion sense, comparing it to NBA players' attire, particularly Eddie Curry's, and the hosts compared the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers.  The Animation Festival was again discussed, with specific mention of an animation featuring a Wesley Snipes prison rant.

A substantial segment focused on YouTube personality Jimmy Justice, who confronts NYC traffic enforcement agents for infractions.  Audio clips played throughout, detailing Justice's confrontations, often with overweight African-American female agents. The hosts discussed Justice's tactics, the legality of the agents' actions, and the power dynamics involved, with frequent use of offensive language and racial slurs directed at the agents.  The discussion included PBA and FOP cards and a listener call. A comical segment about Roland's extreme ticklishness, intended as part of a "Horrific News with Giggling Roland" bit, was partially executed. Patrice O'Neal was again a guest, participating in the animation festival segment and providing commentary on several animations.  Other random topics, like unmarked police cars, were briefly touched upon.  

Further segments included a discussion about a mysterious individual nicknamed "Rockets Red Glare" and a caller's unfulfilled promise to recount swallowing a harmonica. CokeLogic, a Chicago animator who created a cartoon for the show, was featured, along with his animation about Anthony Cumia and Jill Nicolini.  The show heavily featured crude and sexually explicit jokes and advice regarding Anthony's relationship with Jill Nicolini, including detailed descriptions of sexual acts.  Studio staff member Kenny received a bare-bottom spanking from Jimmy for improper tuna disposal, and a failed "sitcom" style segment with E-Rock occurred.  CokeLogicâ€™s personal life was also discussed. Several unnamed callers were featured.

Later segments covered Anthony's adjusted morning routine, focusing on shower time, with Patrice O'Neal providing commentary.  Pat from Munaki, characterized by his size and physical issues, including diabetes and sexual inactivity, became a central focus, discussing his dating life and well-being, including suggestions for purchasing a "GFE" (Girlfriend Experience).  Than, a former employee, and a group of new interns, including Ryan (who has Tourette's syndrome), were also featured.  A phone issue impacting the call-in segment, the Animation Festival (including sponsors), a video of a hit-and-run accident, and several tangents and off-color jokes were included.

The show concluded with a vulgar and chaotic wrap-up, dismissing the audience except for attractive women interested in Jimmy.  The hosts mentioned upcoming meetings, promoted Animationfest.net, and engaged in a nonsensical exchange using the word "out," referencing Lady Stack and Linda Church.  Throughout the broadcast, frequent use of vulgar and offensive language was prevalent.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their audience.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good?  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  All right, we get it.  We were number one across the board with men in Morning Drive Radio here in New York City.  Yeah, we're doing better.  In men, we were number one.  And in women, we crept up to number 375.  So I went to the action puncherist and this fine Chinese doctor popped about 20 needles 
[00:01:00]  in me.  Would you take a needle?  What do you need curing besides your alcoholism?  What's up, Anthony?  Is the date officially over?  Uh, no.  Do you need help?  I'm just being held hostage.  No, you.  Yes, I'm a hostage of love.  Oh, God.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Oh, there's excitement in the air today. 
[00:01:30]  It's a big day for the Opie and Anthony show.  Good morning.  Today is Animation Festival Day.  A live event.  Our first live event since last summer, I do believe.  Right?  Yeah.  And we were looking at the animations again in the office.  My God, man.  People have stepped up.  They really did.  They look great.  We were getting nervous.  We're like, where are the animations for the animation festival?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, we'll let you in on a little something.  About a week ago, I think we had three. 
[00:02:00]  It was really scary.  We were like, oh, we're going to have to cancel this thing.  We started thinking we better cancel this thing.  Yeah.  And then all of a sudden, they just started pouring in last minute.  But quality ones, too.  And the animators did an unbelievable job.  And we're doing the big gig tonight at the Roseland Ballroom here in New York City.  Sold out show.  Headline, animationfest.net.  Yeah.  Write that down.  Mm-hmm.  There's nothing there now. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  Don't look for anything yet.  But I would even say starting at 8 o'clock tonight when we hit the stage.  Yeah.  That page will be filled with all the animations.  Really?  No?  A little later?  I don't know.  They said 11 o'clock.  Yeah, because they were thinking, wait for the event to be over.  But I'm thinking, if you don't have a ticket.  And it doesn't matter.  It doesn't really matter.  What?  Someone in the audience is going to have a computer and go, well, I need to see them now!  I know what this one looks like.  I know they have their iPhones and stuff, but all right, maybe 9 o'clock, 9 or 10 o'clock 
[00:03:00]  tonight, animationfest.net will be live.  Right now, there's just a logo there.  And all the animations that we got will be up there for 48 hours, and then they go to  iTunes.  So we're giving you a chance to get them for free for 48 hours, and then they move over  to iTunes.  Okay?  Good stuff.  But we're very, very excited.  So excited that we're starting to think, we got to wait and see what happens tonight.  But we're starting to think that we're going to do another one sooner than later. 
[00:03:30]  This isn't an annual event.  I think this is like, I think we could squeeze two or three of these a year.  For a while.  For the next year, anyway.  Yeah.  And then maybe we fade it away and come up with something else.  But we got some big wigs, and they wear big wigs.  Giant wigs.  Giant wigs.  Showing up to the animation festival tonight.  There's some interest.  Oh, wow.  Some interest from some big wigs.  Wigs.  Yes.  The wig party is back, and they're rocking. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, political party, people.  They're like, wait a minute.  You know, but Barack Obama?  We might as well get the wig party together again.  The wigs.  We could win this thing.  Instead of the...  Oh, well.  Phone number 877-212-ONA.  That was enough.  Yes, of course.  Jimmy, I see you looking at an iPhone, and I see you smiling.  Now, what is that about?  I got to explain.  Yesterday, Jimmy was very, very close to smashing his iPhone. 
[00:04:30]  I just went on to Google.  I was looking for something.  I was having issues yesterday.  Yeah, yeah.  You're all smiley today.  Well, I had to go back to the iPhone store.  Yeah.  And they just looked at it, and they just swapped it out.  Oh, really?  It's all good.  It's a gonna.  I don't even know if it was or not.  I just...  I was having issues, but I might have had one of this.  I don't know.  Because I rebooted it, and it was one of the buttons, the home button, that I was having 
[00:05:00]  an issue with.  Not the A&B.  It was the home button.  Oh, so they just gave you a new one.  Yeah.  Oh, that's nice.  It was very easy.  It was very easy.  I just went in there.  They're very nice.  I felt like stupid.  So I walk in, and like...  Hey, you!  Did you have an attitude?  Hey, why?  No, but I'm like, they're not gonna help me.  I knew they were gonna help me.  And so the two people just...  There was like 50 helpers standing around, so the two of them just started helping me. 
[00:05:30]  And they went over, and they gave...  This is what they did.  They give you a new phone.  And when I went home, all of my...  I thought I lost everything, but everything I had, all my texts, everything is saved on  your computer.  Like, I didn't know that.  Like, you know, like the text messages and all that stuff.  When you get a new phone, if you back it up, like, from your old phone, from the computer,  I have everything.  I've lost nothing.  Wow.  And so, yeah.  And it's like we're working on the elevator now, and all the places it wasn't working.  Must have been a glitch in the system.  See?  See? 
[00:06:00]  After you exploded yesterday.  I felt like such an ass.  You were going off on everybody.  Yeah, I was very unhappy.  You were attempting to take down phone companies and everything.  Oh, my God.  It was just a glitch in the phone.  He's chopping down an apple tree.  He was just an angry guy.  Nothing?  Boo!  All right.  It's early.  Give him a break.  I was just...  I just felt silly.  Yeah.  Like, it kind of got fixed.  And they're very...  I'll say this for them.  There's no company I've ever dealt with that...  Look, in fairness, it's a new technology. 
[00:06:30]  There's glitches.  I've never had a company that is more willing to just kind of like, just, all right, no  problem.  Yeah, work with you.  Yeah.  That's nice.  There was no problem at all.  They just...  They swapped it out.  And I was with...  I was there, and the last person you want to see when you're having a technical problem  is stupid Colin Quinn.  What?  So I'm standing there with the guy, and he's helping me out, and he goes, hey, what  is it?  Laugh night?  I'm like, what do you mean?  He's like, Colin Quinn is here.  Oh, no.  Ugh.  It must be manic depression night.  Complete ass. 
[00:07:00]  What was Colin doing in there?  He probably didn't even know.  He probably thought it was a deli.  So they went, and they went over.  I'm like, well, get him.  Is he around?  Because I was around a corner.  Yeah.  And they brought, like, a little laptop over, and she was just helping to try to reboot my  old one just to see if that was the issue.  So Colin comes over, and he's just, he talks all the time.  He just never shuts up.  Yeah.  How you doing?  How you doing?  I'm having problems.  I'm having problems.  Lonely?  It's like that loud.  It's like, what are you talking about me being lonely?  Look, you're alone in here, too. 
[00:07:30]  Stupid.  Actually, he's got, like, a whole parade of hot chicks with him.  No one has ever seen him walk around with anybody.  No.  No.  So he shouldn't be calling anyone.  Wow, that's so true.  Every time you see Colin, he is alone.  He's either behind Seinfeld carrying his luggage, or he's alone.  And this is my, since I got the iPhone a couple weeks after it came out, it's about a year  now.  And this is my third one.  They get a little wear and tear.  So, you know, I'm not saying I'm not careful with them, but perhaps I've bumped something.  Ah, perhaps.  So the first one I had, very early on, there was something with it, and then they swapped 
[00:08:00]  it out.  And then I had the next one for, you know, nine months or whatever.  And there was a problem in San Francisco.  So they swapped it out.  So Colin, I'm explaining this to the person, and Colin's coming over, and he's telling the  people behind the counter, like, well, doesn't it seem kind of odd that it's his third phone?  It doesn't seem like maybe that he's doing something wrong that he shouldn't be doing.  I'm like, no, I take very good care of them.  It's just, you know, whatever.  And the guy behind the counter was like, yeah, it is a little weird.  And Colin's like, you know, because you guys got to make money, too.  You know, he's like phone blocking me from getting a new phone.  I'm like, will you shut up? 
[00:08:30]  Phone blocking you.  You know, maybe there's something he's doing with the phone.  And the guy was like, yeah, well, maybe, you know, are you being careful with them?  Like, the guy starts questioning what I'm talking about.  Colin's ready to just give you a new phone, and Colin's like.  They gave me a refurbished one, I think.  But I made sure.  I'm like, well, there's a refurbished one.  Does somebody's earwax in there?  Their breath when they were talking?  No, it's a new shell.  It's like, no, it's just the inner workings have been fixed off.  So I'm like, oh.  So I feel very good today.  Oh, very good.  Oh, good.  I've, you know, knock wood. 
[00:09:00]  I've been very lucky.  I'm on one iPhone.  Oh, boy.  I've had this one.  Why did you just do that?  I just said it because I'll be getting a new one the second, you know, the new ones come out.  Oh, okay.  Which is soon, right?  Yeah.  What?  Next week.  They're so secretive over there.  They are.  This is a creepy cult.  So I'm like, when is the new iPhone coming?  I'd be like, we don't know.  They can't tell you.  But I'm like, there are no iPhones on the web or anything.  So they knew the next week.  All right.  Yeah.  That's why you can't buy any more online on the Apple site.  Yeah. 
[00:09:30]  I walked in.  They're like, hi, how's your phone?  You need help?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We got plenty of these.  Grab one.  Please take one off our hand.  It's in like the 99 cent bin is full of iPhones.  I will be online getting a new one immediately.  Yeah.  Without a doubt.  But you just got a new one.  But I mean, I'll buy a new one.  You're going to get a new one.  All right.  Of course, I'm going to bracing for big brown.  There it is.  Be prepared for that horse to be killed by.  Oh, you're talking about the election.  Oh, well, it's a sad day, actually, because Hillary is officially dropping out. 
[00:10:00]  Now she's she's going to be out by Saturday.  Saturday.  Why not just say I'm out?  I don't know.  It takes a lot.  You can't just like I guess, you know, you got to get rid of your staffers.  You got to find what trucks to pack up all your stuff.  I don't know what it takes, but you could say you're you're you're out.  She's getting like she's going to one of those container stores to get like containers for her pantsuits and stuff.  Yeah.  Now, she's out, but not until Saturday. 
[00:10:30]  No, not until Saturday.  Is she going to be campaigning until Saturday or is she done campaigning?  Why do you have to ask a political question?  That means only one thing.  What?  Ladies and gentlemen, stunt brain.  Yes, stunt brain.  Ah, she's not even quitting.  She is suspending her campaign, which means she's not giving up her delegates in case anything happens.  She's hoping he gets like the bird flu or something.  He's hoping for the thing, the thing, that even if you just hint, you get fired. 
[00:11:00]  I said the bird flu.  Hey, I think people will understand what I meant.  We all know what she's, you know, hoping for secretly.  Oof.  What?  I actually think it's I think it's nothing serious.  I think that she's simply doing that blackmail thing that he was saying that they do to get her money.  Yeah, I think I don't think she's expecting anything bad to happen to Obama.  I think that she knows he's going to go on and be the candidate.  And she just was hoping to get that 40 million. 
[00:11:30]  I believe it's time for everyone to start preparing for the first black president, because now all that needs sandbags.  What do we need?  No, all that needs to happen is placements.  I'm telling you, I'm a I'm a I'm a I'm a I'm a seer.  Oh, call me a seer.  I'm the seer.  You are.  Yes, I am.  My friend.  Yes, I am.  We will have a black president.  And it's because something is going to thank God for the OB sports chance. 
[00:12:00]  There's going to be some kind of medical issue with John McCain.  That's going to scare the crap out of everybody.  And all of a sudden, all of a sudden, you are going to be looking at the first black president.  He's on the United States of America.  He walks around like he has dandruff on his suits.  You don't want a guy like that to be the president.  Some old people, you know, they can't take care of themselves.  And they got dandruff all over the place.  They can't even get their hair right.  He can't wash his hair because he can't put his hands over his head. 
[00:12:30]  So it's like snowing on his shoulders all the time.  Like an old math teacher.  Yeah.  Just with the dandruff on the suit.  Here's some Hillary audio.  This is what she's saying.  It is over.  That according to Hillary Clinton's communications director, Howard Wolfson.  Hillary Clinton will make it official on Saturday in Washington,  where she will be hosting an event to thank her supporters.  According to advisors, Senator Clinton will congratulate Senator Obama and express her support.  However, she will keep her options open to retain her delegates and promote her own agenda of issues. 
[00:13:00]  You're out.  And I don't think Obama's interested in her as the VP, right?  No.  He got a committee together to kind of, you know, figure out who they want.  Headed up by Caroline Kennedy.  What?  Yeah.  He wanted a Kennedy involved, of course.  I see her in my neighborhood.  She waits online to get a croissant and like a thing of tea. 
[00:13:30]  What does she know?  Apparently, they just want that Kennedy name attached to the campaign in some way, shape, or form.  That's what I'm thinking.  But I saw her as like a human being, so.  Oh.  Oh, yes.  Just waiting like everyone else online to get a little croissant.  That's who Neil Diamond wrote Sweet Caroline about.  Yes.  That creep.  Yeah.  When she was a kid.  Yeah.  That creep.  How old was she when that song came out?  We did this whole.  No, we did this whole bit.  Yeah.  She was definitely under 17, 18 years old.  She was, I think, wow, I think she was under 15. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  I think she was really young.  Anyone need anything Googled?  Just zipping around.  Oh, look at Jimmy.  Oh, look at Jimmy.  He's zipping around the internet on his phone now.  I'm so happy.  Jimmy, give me one.  Oh, scrolling through context.  Look at how happy he is.  He's scrolling.  Google popped right up.  Really?  Give me a long one.  Yesterday you had such problems.  Give me a long one.  A long.  That's on the iPhone.  You scroll.  Yeah. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  Like context.  That's all.  You just hit the screen and scroll and everything goes flying past.  I can't do it.  No, you sound like a star.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, exactly.  I'm a Wookiee.  At one point during the next break.  Oh, Caroline was 11.  Thank you.  11.  When the song came out.  Yeah.  Listen to the lyrics of Sweet Caroline now knowing it's about Caroline Kennedy. 
[00:15:00]  Yes, Jimmy.  Just sometime into the next, so I don't forget, I want to say this.  Can we please talk about the anti-bias lawyer with the dominatrix girlfriend?  Oh, okay.  That's what I'm trying to do with her picture.  Sweet.  All right, let's do that next.  No, no, no.  Yeah, we'll do it whenever we get time, but I just, I want it out there so I don't forget.  It is a sad day because I'm about to play something for the last time.  For the last time.  Oh, boy.  We had a lot of fun with this little thing for three or four months, but today is the  last time we play it.  Yeah. 
[00:15:30]  One, two, three, four, five, six, two thousand feet.  Wisconsin, Ohio, Texas, and on to Penn State.  She's going to do it.  Give her just a chance, she'll make it.  Thank God.  Any glass ceiling, she'll break it.  She's going to be our president.  Yeah, I see.  Hillary Clinton.  Nothing's going to turn her back now.  Straight ahead and on the track now.  With plans to make our dreams come true. 
[00:16:00]  Hillary Clinton.  There is nothing she can do.  Except to be the president.  Never heard the word impossible.  There's no time for a chance.  She's going to be where you're on your market set and vote now.  You're not a dream and not the know-how.  With plans to make our dreams come true. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, did you see that jerk?  Make all your dreams come true.  All day, all day, all day, make all our dreams come true.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  For me and you.  Yeah, let's see.  See how sad it is.  Adios.  That was it, right there.  Adios. 
[00:17:00]  It reminds me of a new bit I'm doing around my apartment.  Would you guys like to hear the new bit?  A new bit?  Well, I drive my fiance nuts.  We all know I forced her to call me Greg Audio for a while.  Well, sure.  Which led to Antonio.  Why wouldn't you?  And me.  Well, now, last night I decided to turn my apartment into a, I can't even say this.  This is called throwing yourself under a bus.  Why?  It's probably cute. 
[00:17:30]  My apartment is now the Broadway apartment.  What?  What?  I talk in musical form now in my apartment.  So you'd speak like you're in a musical?  Yeah.  Oh.  I kind of walk in.  Psychotic.  And my fiance is like typing like an email and I just kind of start, what are you doing?  And I do a whole thing for her. 
[00:18:00]  And then I force her to answer me in song.  Okay.  Thank God this isn't me today.  And after four or five, what are, you know, singing, what are you doing?  I finally got her to sing that she's typing an email, but she had to sing.  I bet there was no enthusiasm in it whatsoever when she did it.  She's like, yeah, I'm typing an email.  Her eye contact, she probably looks straight at her.  Typing an email.  Yeah.  Are you typing an email? 
[00:18:30]  You're not giving it to Gusto.  I'm sure you do at home.  No, no.  Oh, I know.  I got to wake up.  Maybe a little later.  I'll do the whole thing.  I bet it is like loud and very flamboyant.  You brought this up.  No, I don't have to hear it.  Honestly, I'm not going with the flamboyant.  It is what it is.  It's just good enough to just do basic Broadway singing.  Yeah.  I bet it's very loud, though, and very, you know, you're out there.  Very big.  Very big.  Sometimes I slide into the room.  Well, I got the wood floor, so I'll slide in. 
[00:19:00]  What are you doing?  I'm typing an email.  What's the next verse?  I'm not going to say yet.  Why?  Because let them listen longer.  Well, that'll keep them listening.  You know what you would do if life was fair at the end of that song?  Yeah.  The big flourish will be when you go, ta-da, and then you body check yourself through the window.  Plummet to your death.  Don't make me turn this into like a, you know, Broadway day with phone calls. 
[00:19:30]  Please don't.  Don't make me do that.  I dare you.  Please don't.  I don't acknowledge you if you're calling the show unless you do your talking in Broadway form today.  They wouldn't.  The listeners aren't that stupid.  They're knocking on.  They don't have the guts to do it.  Oh, Jesus.  No.  I drove her batty yesterday.  Of course you did.  Because I just, because, you know, then the OCD kicks in, and she knows that. 
[00:20:00]  So it's like, I just kept singing my line over and over and over again until she responded in Broadway form.  I'd love to see what email she was sending.  Probably to her parents, what have I gotten myself into?  Yeah, please.  Let me have my old room back.  I think she was typing help me many, many times.  You know, passing the day along.  Why like that, though?  Yeah.  I don't know.  All right.  Ah, yeah.  Steve from Bayshore saying she should run for the vacuum and send Opie scrambling under the bed. 
[00:20:30]  Right.  Blinky, blinky.  Yeah.  Turn on the vacuum and I'll run away like a cockroach.  And I'll stop the Broadway thing.  Sounds like a fun, healthy relationship.  You're singing.  She's chasing you with a vacuum noise.  That's good.  That's good.  All right.  We're going to take our first break.  Phone number 877-212-ONE.  Just want to remind you once again, the animation festivals tonight.  I know.  I know.  I'm talking to just about everyone I'm talking to right now doesn't have a ticket. 
[00:21:00]  But, animationfest.net starting sometime later tonight.  All the animations will be up there for you to view.  And people will be, you know, viewing these around the world, which is really, really cool.  But you can only do that for 48 hours and then it's going to iTunes or somewhere else.  Okay?  Right.  All right.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  No, no, no.  That was the beginning of the show.  No, no, no.  The show has started already.  No, no.  That isn't the intro music back from a break. 
[00:21:30]  No, no.  This is like the start the show music.  I think Stunt Brain's getting a little too comfortable.  Ah.  A little too comfortable around the joint.  I just wanted to blame it on E-Rock.  I couldn't.  No.  I want to welcome everyone to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  I guess we, I guess you didn't think the first break was good enough.  So, I guess we'll start all over again.  Were we supposed to go to you?  Oh.  Oh.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  You know you're really messed up if E-Rock's making fun of you. 
[00:22:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Stunt Brain effed up.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  Ah.  Robert Kennedy.  Yeah.  Killed 40 years ago today.  Oh, I thought you were doing like an old newscast.  It's like, he was.  40 years ago.  40 years ago today.  40 years ago.  And another fine politician died on this date as well.  Would you like to take a guess, my friend? 
[00:22:30]  Would you like to take a guess?  Arba Dwyer.  He was a fine politician.  Was he?  Oh, yeah.  He was.  Yes.  He was terrific.  That's the way you should end your life.  If, uh, yeah.  If you screw up.  He's the guy that killed.  He took the old Roman way out.  He's the guy that killed himself on live TV.  It's, uh.  If you got a good stomach, man, it's a terrific video to check out.  That one I can check out.  No.  The stuff I can't check out is beheading, uh, uh.  No, I can't watch that.  No, that's where I draw the line.  I cannot watch those. 
[00:23:00]  I have not attempted to watch those.  I've, I've seen other people watching them from afar.  And I can't even, I can't even be that close for it.  No, the reaction is too much.  Nope.  But Arba Dwyer pulling that, uh, that gun out of a, uh, a paper bag.  A big gun, too.  And putting it in his mouth and, uh, shooting himself on live TV down there in PA.  What a terrific video to check out.  Check out the rap version, by the way.  Yeah.  Where they, they, they kind of.  Put the rap music to it and. 
[00:23:30]  Go back and forth a little bit.  Yeah, that is pretty good.  It is terrific.  Uh, you, you want to guess the politician died four years ago today?  Four years.  Politician that died four years ago today?  I think.  Abraham Lincoln.  Hmm.  I'm going to go with Jimmy.  You guys are right.  What can I tell you?  Um.  How about.  I don't know.  Paul R. Nelson.  Oh, Anthony.  What?  You, you're disappointing today.  What happened?  Oh, I know it is.  You're disappointing today.  He's your hero, basically. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, that was in the 40s.  Wait a minute.  Reagan.  Reagan.  Four years ago today.  Four years?  Mm-hmm.  That went fast, right?  Time flies.  Four years ago today.  God.  And also, uh, congratulations to the Red Wings and their fans.  Oh, right, yeah.  For winning the Stanley Cup.  I was telling Kenny on the way over today, I'm like, wow, they were still playing hockey.  I haven't been to an Islander game, and I got season tickets in like three months.  It's amazing how long the season went. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Isn't Fourth of July right around the corner?  Yes, it is.  I do remember going to the Nassau Coliseum, and it was really, really cold.  I mean, they gotta cut these seasons down.  Back in the day, there wasn't anything to do, so it was good to have long baseball seasons  and long hockey seasons, you know?  Football's got it down, man.  Football, real quick.  16 games, a few playoff games, a Stanley Cup.  Those guys can't take anymore.  A Super Bowl undone.  Those guys can't take anymore.  They'd be dead. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  But I think basketball is a ridiculously long season.  Mm-hmm.  And I don't pay attention to basketball, but I just know they're always talking about it.  Like, year-round, they're constantly talking about basketball.  That's because you hate it so much.  It probably is.  You know, I'm not a fan of the game.  Because baseball is way longer.  Dung, dung, dung, dung, dung.  How many days a year?  Dung, dung, dung, dung, dung.  Two points.  Dung, dung, dung, dung, dung.  Two points.  Dung, dung, dung.  All right.  Gets up to in the hundreds. 
[00:25:30]  The whole object of watching a game is the excitement of a team scoring.  It's like, yes!  Basketball, every two seconds.  Dung, dung, dung, dung.  Two points.  I used to be a huge fan.  I don't watch as much these days.  No?  Who do you want in the finals, though?  Oh, God.  Well, of course.  You know.  The Bulls.  No, you know who's in the finals.  L.A. and Boston.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll have to go with the Celtics. 
[00:26:00]  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  I think the Celtics win because the Patriots didn't.  How nice would that be for the city?  Okay.  How nice would that be?  Well, there's a win for L.A.  And that's how the sports curse works.  O.B. puts his...  It's always just a casual little thing.  A casual little comment.  That's it.  It can't be people calling up going, O.B., could you please root for this team so the  other team wins?  No.  It doesn't work like that.  No.  It's that...  See, just what you just heard.  A casual little passing comment by O.B. about a sports team, and they are doomed to lose. 
[00:26:30]  We will be replaying this in about a week.  I do want the Celtics because I think it would just be nice for the city that they win because  the Patriots lost the Super Bowl.  I think that would be a great story to write.  Oh, it's so over now.  I think that would be a wonderful story.  It's so over now.  And Ralph from Belleville writes, hey, RFK was shot on June 5th.  He died on June 6th.  You're wrong again.  Hmm.  He did last?  I always thought he...  How the hell did...  I always thought he died pretty fast. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, boy.  Stunt brain.  Stunt brain knows everything.  Well, no.  Honestly, because a lot of people go, wow, he's on the show a lot.  Only when we talk politics.  So what we have to do is stop talking about politics, and stunt brain goes away.  Yes, stunt brain.  Yeah, it was a late night.  He was going through the hotel kitchen, remember?  Right.  It was a big speech.  So technically...  Yeah, it was morning here, but it was night in California.  So it's one of those time zone things.  Ah.  He was shot like 11 o'clock.  Morning here, night in California.  Yeah, he was shot like 11 o'clock at night, but it was 2 o'clock in the morning here. 
[00:27:30]  But he lasted, and they called him after midnight.  Oh, okay.  That's fair.  Well, that makes sense.  We thought you had your thing twisted.  You had your thing twisted, but...  40 years ago.  40 years ago.  All right.  So he lasted, what, four or five hours?  Not much longer.  I wouldn't think that long.  Jeez.  He didn't look too good on the floor.  Let's go to Bob in Pennsylvania.  Bob.  Hey there, Bob.  Hey, what's going on?  I just wanted to know what you guys think about the Bilderberg group meeting right now.  Who?  Oh, the Bilderberg group. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  Yep.  Yeah.  That's the group that decides who the world leaders are going to be.  Yep.  And they take over hotels all over the world, and then they figure out who they want next.  And what do they do?  This is Illuminati type stuff.  We usually meet every four years in North America, and in the past two years they've actually met twice.  So it's very suspicious. 
[00:28:30]  We had info.  The Bilderberg group?  The anointed one.  Wait, so now it's turned out that Obama is the nominee, so it's very suspicious there.  They might be planning to kill him, or they might be set up a race war.  You might get what you want, Anthony.  I never want a race war, my friend.  I've never said that in my life.  Dude, hold on.  The Bilderberg group.  What are you talking about?  No, it's the Bilderberg group.  It's where you take your kids to a store, and they build their own bears.  And they're cute as a button. 
[00:29:00]  Dude, what are you talking about?  That's very good.  Sir?  It's a real thing, Jimmy.  But what is it?  What is it?  It's secretive stuff.  Who are these, sir?  He doesn't want to say.  Wow, he is just mum.  Mum's the word.  Where'd he go?  Bob.  He was just killed.  The Bilderberg group was created by Joseph Rettinger and Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands,  and he was actually a top SS Nazi officer.  They basically, their goal is to create a new world order. 
[00:29:30]  They're meeting right now.  You guys should check it out.  We have two investigative reporters there covering it.  We'll get the attendee list soon, hopefully.  We have a few moles in there.  And it's very suspicious what's going on right now.  Very, very suspicious.  And I just wanted to know what you guys think of it, please.  Well, just to give some info, the original Bilderberg conference was held at the Hotel  De Bilderberg near Amhem in the Netherlands from May 29th to May 31st, 1954. 
[00:30:00]  The meeting was initiated by several people, including Joseph Rettinger, concerned about  the growth of anti-Americanism in Western Europe, who proposed an international conference  at which leaders from European countries and the United States would be brought together  with the aim of promoting understanding between the cultures of the United States of America  and Western Europe.  Wow.  Is there anything else to add to that there?  That sounds pretty interesting.  Have they ever had any impact or influence on anything? 
[00:30:30]  I don't know.  I don't know.  You would think people would know that?  Or is it just a couple of clowns that just sit in a room and...  Rumsfeld is, as I said, an active Bilderberger.  Peter Sutherland, who I don't know, from Ireland.  So these are all, like, international bankers and guys that run the...  The world.  ...and defense experts, media press pass barons, government ministers, prime ministers, royalty.  How many people would you say attend this? 
[00:31:00]  130.  130?  What hotel do they stay in?  I hope it's not like a Motel 5.  Is that even a hotel?  I think it's Holiday Inn.  I think it's Motel 6.  Oh, I don't know.  I stay only in five-star places.  Okay, Motel 5.  What kind of place do they stay in, sir?  What hotel?  Yeah, where are they this time?  Caller.  Boy, he doesn't like talking.  No, he's just trying to pace himself.  Right now, they're at the Westfield Marriott Hotel, and they're going to be meeting from  today till the 8th.  So what do they do at these meetings? 
[00:31:30]  They probably don't sit down and go, all right, we're taking over the world.  Frank's suggestion.  Yeah.  How does this go?  Yeah, how does this work there, Bob?  We don't know that.  Bob, but you don't know.  No one knows?  Because they don't let anybody in there.  If anything has been meeting since 1954 or whatever the hell it was, people would kind  of know how it works.  Somebody would tape it, dude.  Yeah.  Somebody would break ranks.  Somebody would come out and say, hey, this is what happens.  Thanks, Bob.  Bob is so secretive. 
[00:32:00]  Bob, is there a problem with the phone?  No, there's a problem with Bob.  Why are you so slow in responding?  I'm not slow.  I mean, you just don't really seem to be taking it seriously.  We're asking you questions.  How are we not taking it seriously?  Jimmy's asking you questions.  I'm asking you legitimate questions.  All right.  What do you want to know?  I just asked you.  What question?  I'm done.  All right.  Thanks, Bob.  We can't talk.  Somebody who knows what they're talking about instead of some, what are you, a kid that 
[00:32:30]  read something on the internet?  Somebody that understands this a little bit better, who didn't just read off Wikipedia.  Let's go to New Hampshire.  Rocco, New Hampshire.  Now we're stuck.  You guys are taking it seriously?  Shut up, Bob.  Now we're stuck talking about the Bilderberg group.  He sounds Illuminati to me.  Give me the bell.  That was a damn good one.  Oh, it certainly was Illuminati.  Rocco.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Hey, dude.  Ling-along.  How are we doing?  What's up, man?  How are we doing?  How are we doing?  Very well.  No, I'm just kidding.  All right.  Good.  Oh, okay.  We are doing well. 
[00:33:00]  I hope he's a baritone.  That's right.  I wanted to actually, I just wanted to comment actually on the Bilderberg group because what  they are is they're a group of people, of national leaders that meet not as national  leaders.  They meet and they strip themselves purposely of their titles and they go there without  their titles to prevent them from being arrested because what they're doing is actually  considered illegal according to American law.  What law?  It's called the Logan Act. 
[00:33:30]  And the Logan Act actually prevents...  Which means you can't get up before noon.  The Logan Act.  It prevents murders between satellite radio companies.  The Logan Act.  All the mini bars in the hotel empty.  That's right.  You have to cease people with retarded hairdos and then emulate yourself after them.  Why couldn't it be called anything else but that?  It's got to be the Logan Act.  The Logan Act.  The Elo Act.  Yeah.  Of course.  Wow.  Aren't you the smart one.  Well, at least he doesn't either mad that when I take you totally seriously, like, you 
[00:34:00]  know, Bob's stick in the mud who called in before.  Easy.  So, all right.  So, they strip themselves there.  What does the Logan Act say?  The Logan Act actually indicates, and I'm only paraphrasing.  What they're saying is, American consulates and diplomats and presidents and secretaries  of state can't meet with other people to talk about the rules and the laws, you know,  to prevent exactly what the quote-unquote elitists and David Rockefeller and other different 
[00:34:30]  individuals are trying to do, which is, to Opie's point, you know, the new world order,  which has been around for, you know, they've been talking about it since before the Bilderberg  group.  The new world order is old now.  Yeah.  What's that?  Wait a minute.  It's kind of weird.  How do they strip themselves of the titles?  Yeah.  Most of those are retired.  How do you strip...  According to a book I read, and I've been reading this book, it's really actually very  interesting.  Jimmy, I know you're very well-read, and I have to tell you, of all the times I've actually 
[00:35:00]  heard you, you're very well-read, and I really respect that a lot, and I mean  that sincerely.  Thank you.  The people that...  There's a guy who wrote a book.  His name is Eltest or something.  It's called Inside the Bilderberg Group, and I'm not sure what that guy was talking about,  because when I got on the radio, I turned off the radio, and I really wasn't listening  to him, because I want to listen to facts.  You didn't miss anything.  Go ahead.  Yeah, well, so what ends up happening is these people, they talk about different things,  like the price of oil is a perfect example.  You know, the price of oil was what? 
[00:35:30]  A couple years ago, blah, blah, blah, blah, whatever it was.  Well, now, you know, it's ridiculous, and they've been talking about this for years,  and you guys were talking about a guy a couple weeks ago, Alex Jones.  He's got that radio show down in Texas.  Yeah, the conspiracy guy, right?  Yeah.  He's been actually following the Bilderberg Group as well for a number of years, and it's  really actually very fascinating information, because he was talking...  The other guy who was before me was talking about how he has moles in there, and this  and that.  There's no such thing as moles in there.  They provide information externally to other people, because they cannot write down notes. 
[00:36:00]  They're forbidden from writing down notes.  How come they can't write down...  How has nobody ever taped one of those things?  Because, I'll be honest with you, I've never been there, don't really know, but what I'm  seeing in a lot of the...  All right, let me phrase you like this.  How could it be that all of these people, David Rockefeller, Donald Rumsfeld, Hillary Clinton  has actually been to the Bilderberg Group a number of years, and she was actually approached 
[00:36:30]  by...  And Clinton's been in the Bilderberg Group.  So, these Bilderbergers actually invite people to these actual seminars, and they meet in these  really, like, in-the-woods kind of places, all over the world, not just in America, but  the guy was right.  Every four years, they're supposed to meet in America, because that's part of the rules,  and it's all had to go back to the Trilateral Commission, and...  Trilateral Commission.  Help me out here, Opie.  You know some of the other stuff, too. 
[00:37:00]  The WWE...  Yeah, if you could see the look on Opie's face, you'd realize you went to the wrong fella  for help.  Oh my God, I'm sweating.  I'm like, I felt like I was in school, and I'm like, please don't call on me, and you  did.  Steve from Bayshore is saying conspiracy, because Bilderberg sounds like Bill Burr.  Ah.  I'm wondering if it's a whole conspiracy being built.  Well, I can't help you, sir.  I believe it's the Jews getting together and doing some nasty stuff.  Oh. 
[00:37:30]  No.  No?  Oh, actually, on a real side note, we actually met a long time ago at the Priceline Party  back in 1999, and we actually all hung up together.  Oh, how's that Priceline stock doing for you?  It was good when it got out of it, but, you know.  Oh.  Yeah.  All right.  I got information from the Bilderberg Group.  Oh, thank you, buddy.  Hey, wait.  Hold on.  Stunt Taint had a point.  Stunt Taint.  What exactly...  I was going to ask him if this was related to the Bohemian Grove Group, because the Bilderberg  Groups were also some of the same guys who meet in the Bohemian Grove, and they're 
[00:38:00]  actually deep in the woods deciding this stuff, and there's a whole ritual with a bunny suit.  They supposedly...  A bunny suit?  Yeah.  Somebody's...  Like in The Shining?  Yeah, kind of.  I'm not actually as...  I apologize.  I don't mean to interrupt you.  I don't think stump brain is appropriate.  I think brain is appropriate.  I think just brain should go with that.  Nah, but you realize that the brain...  No, because then he does things like he puts the wrong music in.  Yeah, he's really conspiratorial.  I bet the Bilderbergs told him to do so.  But there was a book called Pest by a guy who followed all these conspiracies around the 
[00:38:30]  world and took it from a pretty interesting perspective, and he tried to get into the Bilderberg  meeting and was shut down.  And they were chased and followed through the streets of some sort of northern England  country town by black limousines.  And they actually called the embassy, and they were told, you better leave him alone.  Well, anyone who's being followed by black limousines, that's probably not the most  discreet way to follow you.  You can all look now, but the fleet of limos is behind us to the left. 
[00:39:00]  They probably will follow you with a more discreet vehicle.  I think we're being followed.  Yes.  What is it?  It's that tank with the bells on it.  Wouldn't it be a cab or something?  I know.  Something that blends in.  Or just like, you know, be a brown Audi or something?  Yes, a fleet of black limos.  Exactly.  Then you know you're in trouble.  No, it's just a prom down the street.  Don't look now, but there's a 727 rolling on the street behind us.  Get the bitch.  Follow that little Prius.  All right, Rocco.  Thank you. 
[00:39:30]  Thank you, sweetie.  Thank you, John.  Good day.  It's very mysterious, this whole thing.  I'm going to do a little bragging about the Opie and Anthony show featuring and starring  at the same time, Jim Norton.  Cool.  We just made a discussion on the Bilderberg group.  Very interesting for everybody.  Yeah.  But confusing.  But confusing.  Still, I've not been enlightened.  Not at all.  I'm going to have to do some reading.  Not at all.  Are you queer?  Yeah, a little reading.  I think we're going to almost go a whole show without talking about Anthelini.  Almost.  Almost? 
[00:40:00]  Almost.  Almost.  But people do want their Anthelini updates.  Of course they do.  Power couple of Long Island.  Yeah.  And you haven't missed anything.  This is the latest update right here.  This is all you need to know.  Just when you thought all the news that could have happened already did, we have more juicy  information on the Long Island power couple known simply as Anthelini.  The two recently celebrated their two-week anniversary.  Yes, two weeks.  Into a relationship.  It was our two-week anniversary. 
[00:40:30]  After spending last weekend in Boston, the jet-setting Long Island rubbish duo are heading  to Nashville, Tennessee for the CMA Music Festival.  What am I doing?  You're going?  We are going to go to Nashville.  Right.  And watch the Nashville bar scenes.  We're going to hang out and drink in Nashville.  I got probably three to four hours in tonight before Anthony's on stage singing with a variety  of Hilton.  The two are continuing their hot and heavy, unapologetic make-out sessions in public. 
[00:41:00]  Rumor has it they may be making out all the way to the altar.  We'll keep you informed with all the schmoopy updates from Anthelini.  Love how these unsubstantiated little rumors are presented as fact.  See, you don't watch the celebrity show.  Oh, no, I do.  This is quite accurate.  I know.  It's exactly like the celebrity shows.  It certainly is.  Any updates?  That's pretty much it?  That's where we're at right now?  We took a nice long nappy yesterday.  Are you guys living together officially? 
[00:41:30]  No, no, not officially or anything like that.  I think in the couple of weeks we've been together, we've actually spent the entire time, the night  and everything, probably out of the 15 or so days we've been together, 16 days.  You're up to 16 days.  I think we've been together for 14 days.  You've slept over 14 days out of 15? 
[00:42:00]  Back and forth.  Doesn't matter.  Together?  At our respective houses.  Wait, out of 16 days?  Wow.  14 days together.  That's pretty impressive because you guys don't, it's not like you're neighbors.  No.  You have to make a major effort for one of you to be at the other person's house.  It's kind of easy though because it's close to work kind of a thing at her place and then  my place is nice.  We're kind of out there on Long Island.  Let me ask you a question. 
[00:42:30]  Yes, sir?  Respectfully, of course.  Of course.  She's a very beautiful girl.  Thank you.  Yes, sir.  Did you have a moment where you saw her, whether it was naked or in underwear, and you just  went, uh, I'm little Anthony.  What am I doing here?  That's when you have to man up, Jim.  What I'm saying is-  Sometimes you really got to man up.  But was there that moment where you're like, you just were like, oh, like we realized the  magnitude of the-  There are a couple of moments where, and again, I'm very respectful, but let's just say like 
[00:43:00]  yesterday, we get done with our nap and we're going to get up and go out to a restaurant  to eat.  So we have to shower.  And my bedroom, if I look from my bed, I get a clear shot right down my hallway into  my big master bathroom.  So Jill didn't want to get her hair wet, so she was using the handheld little shower thing 
[00:43:30]  in the shower.  So I'm just looking, and I have a full glass door on the shower.  So that's the view I had.  And I'm just watching, and at that point, yes, Jim, I did get that moment like, holy  Jesus, I'm in over my head.  What am I-  But then you got to man up.  You got to man up and go, hey, I'm the man.  I can deal with this.  I'm used to being in the shallow end of the pool.  This deep end stuff.  I'm going to hold on to the- 
[00:44:00]  Deep end.  I'm going to hold on to the sides of the pool with dear life.  Well, that's what she thinks when she sees-  Poor dear life, yes.  His silhouette in the shower, she just sees a very skinny guy who looks like he's just  holding an elephant's trunk.  She's like, oh my God.  Ah, Jesus.  Did you have one of those, what's the movie, Fast Times?  Like a Phoebe Cates moment where she's just kind of moving-  Slow motion.  She's moving toward you in slow motion.  Yeah.  Maybe through the steam of the bathroom or the shower area. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah, I would only have-  But then my towels are so big that she comes out and she has to wrap the towel around her  head and it's 20 feet high.  So then it just looks silly.  Yeah.  And that brings it back down to earth.  Brings everyone right back down to earth.  Look how silly you look.  Naked.  Big, silly towel head.  All right.  You know what?  We'll do all our Anthony stuff here.  And then we're going to move on to one of my favorite people in the entire world.  Jimmy Justice after the break.  Jimmy Justice. 
[00:45:00]  We got more Jimmy Justice after the break.  But first-  Oh, I also want to say happy 8th birthday to the CW11 News.  Look at that.  They're celebrating 8 years.  Wanda Sykes.  That's an awful party.  Of course it is.  It's two ladies.  They got like some feathers and there's some green balloons.  CW parties are a bust.  It's horrible.  They're having a better party.  Like smug guy.  Give him like eight belts of booze.  Watch him try to deliver the news.  Billy Bath's party was better. 
[00:45:30]  I had more balloons and bigger laughs.  Ruined my party.  Don't get nervous.  Don't get nervous.  Yeah.  Break up my party.  We'll play this going into break.  Another little bit on Anthony here.  O&A Records is proud to resent the all-new Anthony Cumia Sing Along Country Hotel.  Just like other rednecks, Ant knows country music is synonymous with one thing. 
[00:46:00]  Binge drinking.  It's only half past twelve, but I don't care.  It's five o'clock somewhere.  Wine dancing, cowboy hats, and passing out with your head in the toilet.  Ant goes country.  Drinking bones connected to the party bones.  The party bones connected to the staying out all night long.  From the tap room to the hockey tonk, you can drink till you puke and sing along to all 
[00:46:30]  Ant's country favorites.  I grew up.  My roots were based in country music.  I was a cowboy.  Save a horse from the cowboy.  Y'all don't believe that Ant likes country music?  Well, with a hot piece of ass like Jill on your a**, you'd go country too. 
[00:47:00]  And I'm a late fall shooting, double-fisted drinking son of a gun.  The Anthony Cumia Sing Along Country Hoedown.  Get yours today.  I'm Anthony Cumia, and I endorse this product.  Good morning, it's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Entering the studio, Perry Mason, everybody.  Perry Mason joining the Opie and Anthony Show today.  Treaky.  Hello, sir.  You look like the black Perry Mason. 
[00:47:30]  Not Perry Mason.  Oh, you know what?  Damn it, I'd have...  What'd you do?  Superman, Perry White.  Oh, Perry White.  Ah, damn it!  But it's Perry Black.  Oh.  Ah, screwed it all up.  Opie and Anthony, 877-212-018.  Patrice O'Neal has entered the studio.  How are you, Patrice?  A strange middle-aged white man just took my coat.  Who is this?  A stunt brain.  Oh, okay.  You'll be hating him within the hour.  Hating?  Really? 
[00:48:00]  Just some smarmy white dude?  No, he's great, actually.  He's very educated.  He's the latest hire.  Because...  Just, I think we're trying to go a little more legit, so we actually hired someone that  has radio experience.  Well, I know you guys talking about conspiracies and things like that.  Of course.  And your relationship.  Wow.  Dude, you were the one who told Anthony a long time ago to...  No, no, don't...  That's fine.  You're mad, right?  No, not really.  No, it's fine.  I'll just roll with what you guys are talking about. 
[00:48:30]  What's going on?  All right, cool.  Patrice did suggest that Anthony needs to go out with Jill Nicolini.  Not just Jill...  This was way before McFoley came by as the love maker, the matchmaker there.  Damn.  Patrice is right.  Mankind.  Everybody brought it up.  Mankind did it for you.  That's cool.  Everybody brought up the fact that Patrice said it quite a while ago.  And personally in his ear. 
[00:49:00]  Jill Nicolini, when I came from the thing, they're single.  All these high-level chicks and nobody wants to date a single.  All right.  I'm just...  Look how annoyed he is that he hasn't been acknowledged.  I just...  It's just, you know, a personal...  Hey, man.  I took your advice.  I upgraded from these, you know, refrigerator repair girls' daughters.  Yeah, you really should explain.  You basically said, Anthony, you're going down the wrong road.  You need to... 
[00:49:30]  Upgrade your life.  Upgrade.  Go after someone like Jill Nicolini.  She's single.  She would be great for you.  He said this whole thing on...  He did.  ...on an XM show.  And then when you guys went out until all hours of the night, he got your ear.  And that is what he said when we were hanging out at the bar that night.  And then Socko comes in and just makes a legitimate...  I see.  I see.  Fair enough.  Socko.  Wow.  Is that your...  Wow.  See?  Wow.  You get to watch her on television.  No way old crazy Patrice could ever... 
[00:50:00]  Patrice is nutty to think that Jill Nicolini could ever...  Well, fair enough.  Well, you know, it seemed like it was...  You know, maybe it's my own...  Like, my self-esteem wasn't very high.  I didn't think that I could...  You know, I should aim...  I should aim there.  Yep.  I told you.  Stop pal talking.  Yeah.  Stop it.  Stop giving access to these nobodies.  Look at her.  Look at her.  Who would have thought that she had such self-hatred?  That's what I mean. 
[00:50:30]  It's like she's...  Beautiful women...  Fat girls and ugly women always have a man.  And these beautiful women don't...  They can't get it.  They don't understand.  They don't understand.  Patrice is a guru.  He is a guru of all things to do with relationships.  He really is the smartest guy I know.  Not even smart.  Just like...  Do you know why?  You have like a super...  You're a superhero for relationships.  I'm an overweight guy who likes women. 
[00:51:00]  I had to figure it out some kind of way.  And the only thing is thank God that they don't think like us.  That's all I have to say about women.  Thank God they're not us.  Because then I'll be in deep trouble.  Yeah.  Well, Patrice, this is the question today.  You obviously set up Anthony with Jill Nicolini.  How does he keep someone like Jill Nicolini?  By understanding she's the traffic girl.  And never letting her forget it. 
[00:51:30]  No disrespect.  That's just my advice.  Patrice, you are better than Jill Nicolini.  That's all I'm saying.  I'm loving the tie and everything, Patrice.  Thank you very much.  You are upgrading.  We only saw you a few months ago and you've upgraded since the last look you had.  I know.  He's got like a real nice fedora, the jacket, and then he takes it off.  He's got a nice shirt and tie on with a tie clip.  And you're thinking about...  The whole deal.  He's thinking about colors and everything. 
[00:52:00]  I know.  You're thinking...  Is somebody dressing you?  No.  No.  Didn't let it happen.  And look, nice pants and everything.  Look at this shoes.  Didn't you see all the signs around town for the yard sale with a bunch of 50XL jerseys?  Did you have a nervous breakdown or something?  It seems like yesterday you were walking in with a huge oversized Pink Panther t-shirt.  Yeah.  And now you've got this look going on.  Sports jerseys.  It's been a year.  It's been a year upgrading.  You've got the Brad Pitt I'm cool hat and everything.  I'm copying.  I just look and I say... 
[00:52:30]  It came back real quick.  It came from the NBA when they made them the dress code.  Right.  And I was against it a lot.  But just because of the fact that somebody's telling you how to dress.  But when I saw Eddie Griffin...  Or not Eddie Griffin.  Eddie...  Izzard?  No.  From the Knicks.  Eddie Izzard.  They're not being a dress.  Whatever.  Eddie...  Whatever.  Curry from the Knicks.  He's a basketball player.  And he had a...  They made him wear a suit.  I was listening to every Eddie Curry talk. 
[00:53:00]  I was like, damn.  Why am I listening?  He was looking like somebody that I should be listening to.  Ah.  Yes.  So I just put a hat on first and dressed down from the hat.  From the hat down to the shoes.  And he's right though.  He's dressed like somebody you should be listening to.  Even though...  Yeah.  Maybe once you've seen him in a robe, paying for sex in a fair world country, the tie doesn't  matter anymore.  He's upgraded from there.  Celtics, Lakers.  You're from Boston.  I'm not even going to watch it. 
[00:53:30]  Why?  I just...  First time in 21 years.  The pain and suffering of the loss, I think that's going to happen.  To the Celtics?  Yeah, man.  Kobe just looks like he can beat an entire team by himself.  He just...  It's just something godly about how he's playing, man.  I just don't even want to watch it.  I thought they were finished when Shaq left, but I guess not.  That was probably a smart move to you.  This is the point Kobe wants to make.  Dude, yeah.  I think he's going to make it too.  I just don't see it.  Kobe's like, look, I could do this without you.  That's what he wants. 
[00:54:00]  He wants to show the world he could do it without Shaq.  I mean, I'm for him, man.  I'm not a fly-by-night Celtics fan.  I love the Celtics, man.  Larry Bird's my favorite player ever.  And I mean, I want to see him do it, but the Kobe just...  Him and some foreigners are beating...  He's beating everybody to death.  I just don't see Garnett.  It's something...  The white European ghetto boys.  And Kobe.  Kobe and his foreign friends, because he speaks all their languages.  Yeah. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, he's like...  Well, because his dad played in Italy.  Yeah, dude.  They don't know that.  I'm scared to even...  I just...  I'd rather...  I'm doing this cartoon festival with you guys today.  Which is...  I'd rather do that.  Which is tonight, and once again, AnimationFest.net, all the animations will be up there after  the festival tonight.  I gotta tell you, there's one that you're featured prominently in.  The Wesley Snipes.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, they did...  The Wesley Snipes rant you did?  We just did that.  No kidding.  Just talking about Wesley Snipes being in prison.  Yeah, yeah.  We were talking about that. 
[00:55:00]  Somebody just throw that together quick.  And the animation of you is hysterical.  Me, I mean, they've really...  That guy obviously didn't like me very much.  He got me about 90 years old.  Yeah.  It's really funny.  It is very funny.  It's really funny to see what the animators think of every person on this show, and it's  obvious by the animations who their favorites are and stuff.  Every single one with Bob Kelly in it, he's just an engorged tick.  It's just laying there, fat eating stuff. 
[00:55:30]  But the Wesley Snipes one could win the whole thing.  Oh, is that good?  Yeah.  It's going to be right up there when it's all said and done.  It's very funny.  Have y'all been talking about them?  There's a lot of really good ones, man.  There's one that looks like a Pixar animation.  Looks like Pixar.  Really?  The detail is just amazing.  But how long does it take for that?  I don't know.  That one had to take a long time.  Before, I'm super impressed by these...  You'll see.  You're going to walk away tonight going, wow.  Okay.  Wow.  Even the bad ones are interesting.  There's none of them that are terrible that I think I could have done. 
[00:56:00]  Even the ones that are lower level are still good enough to get some kind of...  Is that one where you were telling us the ones that they showed at the virus?  Is that...  Those are mostly Coke Logic.  Yeah.  I mean, Coke Logic does a really good one.  Coke Logic's submission could win the whole thing.  Which one was his?  I forget.  It was really good.  I don't...  Well...  Ramone.  He animated a Ramone call.  Yeah.  But how he did it, it was really, really smart.  Yeah.  Really, really smart.  So tonight's the big show.  AnimationFest.net.  All the animations will be up there. 
[00:56:30]  You're kind of rooting for him anyway because he's always been doing stuff.  I met him in Chicago.  I remember him.  He wanted to animate something.  He mentioned that years ago when I saw him at the comedy club in Chicago.  He's the real deal, man.  He's great.  Yeah, absolutely.  Really fast on Instant Feedback.  Steven S. from Bayshore is on fire.  Anthony is in a Blitzkrieg romance.  He also writes, say what you want about the whole Anthelini thing, but Jill has put some  pep back into Ant's goose steps.  Ooh.  Yeah.  And finally, he also writes today, in another couple of years, the CW11 News... 
[00:57:00]  Oh, shaking his hand.  Very good.  Sir.  Because we learned, what, CW's celebrating their eighth anniversary today?  Yeah, something like that.  Steven S. writes, in another couple of years, the CW11 News will be too old for Ant to watch.  Hey.  I'm very proud of you, man.  I backed off of the children.  Very proud of you.  Got rid of those suicide girls.  Ant's a big fan of the suicide girls.  No more tattoos inside of the lip, girls.  No more pierces when they're not supposed to be.  See, I'm really proud of you, man, but just don't let your self-esteem get lower, Jack. 
[00:57:30]  This is what you're supposed to be.  It trickles down from King Ant.  King Ant.  Don't you ever forget it, dude.  Okay.  That's it.  I like taking Patrice's advice.  So he's saying that whenever there's an issue and she maybe is getting on him about something,  just keep thinking you're not the anchor.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Just, dude, you are, look, you're established.  Right.  You understand?  Don't forget that. 
[00:58:00]  That's all I'm saying.  You are an established man.  Exactly.  You got things to teach, Miss Nicolini.  Don't you ever forget it.  Patrice makes you feel really powerful and good about whatever relationship you're in,  and then you get home and realize that you're just meant to be a cuckold.  I'm going to tell you, I look at my girl and I just, I should, I just should bow down to  her and be held.  But I know how abusive she is and how abusive they are, so I just have to stay arrogant.  You got to stay arrogant.  That's it.  Wow. 
[00:58:30]  I bought her like, I bought a lot of shoes yesterday.  I actually was shopping for her for shoes.  Really?  Sometimes I got to do that for her because of the things that I put her through.  You got to get her some shoes.  And even if she's up to no good, she deserves to do bad things to me for what she's put up  through.  What I put her through to do bad things, she deserves, she deserves, if she's out to get  me, she deserves it.  Because I know I put her through the test.  This is the odd little paradox with you.  You talk about a relationship and talk about how you got to be arrogant and go in there 
[00:59:00]  and just, you know, the king, you're the king and everything else trickles down.  But then you identify the fact.  The queen gets to be, to have the spoils of the kingdom.  Well, that's what you do.  You then identify and know that you put her through hell and she must be rewarded for this.  Oh my God.  I curse her out for no reason many times, man.  Just so she don't think that she can get her upper hand. 
[00:59:30]  It's a low self-esteem thing, but it has to be done with all of them because women, they  don't want to win.  They want a winner.  Oh.  So Nicolini don't want to get up talking about no damn Travis.  She wants to look at her man get up and be a powerful radio dude and go, that's my  man right there.  Ask her.  God damn.  That Patrice.  He's got to have his own relationship show.  Amazing.  Ask her.  She don't want to do, what does she want to do that for?  And then a bus crash.  It's like, she's better than that. 
[01:00:00]  She just wants to be in your mansion, Jack.  Don't ever forget it.  Just saying, I'm very proud.  I just want to say I'm proud of you.  Oh, that's fantastic.  I heard about it.  I was very happy about that, man.  Oh, thank you, Patrice.  That is so goddamn funny.  My favorite moment was the summation of the traffic report.  He's just pointing at the air, just going, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, this, that, whatever. 
[01:00:30]  Whatever.  So I'm happy.  I'm very happy for you.  Thanks, dude, Patrici.  They're moving at light speed, though, Patrice.  I heard it.  The love word was thrown around after a mere couple days.  It's because of his self-esteem.  He wouldn't think about this.  Would you ever tell one of the airs there who never you would say love to them?  You never would.  Unless they were in your life for a long time.  But I understand that this is way on another.  To a whole other level of right. 
[01:01:00]  Because another thing that's messing with you, everybody, like, in the morning wants  her.  And I know you still have this cloudy disbelief that she wants you, but that's what you hang  on to.  You always hang on to the fact that she could be out to get you.  Oh, really?  Yes.  And just enjoy the ride.  And always know that she could be, like, going, oh, take this turn and take that turn  and she could be, like, taking you to her real boyfriend to rob you.  Always believe that. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, my God.  And just enjoy.  When y'all are cuddling up, you just go, ah, you know.  This is great.  But she's out to get me.  It just keeps you on your toes.  That's all.  That is all.  That's it, man.  I always believe she's setting you up for a home and baby.  You can't believe that she's going to wake up from this temporary insanity that she has.  But you bring something to her that she's never going to have, man. 
[01:02:00]  Ever.  Don't coochie-coo it too much.  That's all I'm saying.  Don't coochie-coo too much?  Don't coochie-coo too much.  Let her coochie-coo you.  That's all.  I noticed there's not as many Pal Talk windows open these days there, Anthony.  Good.  I get reflections.  Wow.  Good.  I got E-Rock's camera and my camera open.  There's something going on with that because, man, that used to be nothing but cameras open.  Let me look.  For his viewing pleasure.  They had a meeting about Anthony, but don't you look back, dude.  They're still your loyal subjects. 
[01:02:30]  You just have to upgrade.  Stop dating the subjects.  You got to get some blue blood.  You ever see Coming to America?  You need a girl in there going, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.  You need that.  You need somebody that was bred to be a queen.  Stop dating the subjects.  You're getting some blue blood.  Yeah.  Stop messing with these girls with dirty fingernails.  Forget about it.  So that you can feel better about yourself.  Trust me, you're higher than you think you are now.  Oh, God damn.  Let's say hi to Ryan in New Jersey. 
[01:03:00]  Ryan, we got Patrice O'Neill in studio.  He's going to be at the Animation Festival tonight.  I'm excited about that, man.  Good morning.  Yeah, it's going to be great.  What do you got, bro?  Hey.  I'm just wondering when Dr. Patrice here is going to write a book teaching us all how  to be a man.  What did I tell you, Patrice?  I've told Patrice on many occasions.  See, you give Anthony advice that he doesn't listen to.  You don't listen to my advice, my friend.  I do.  You should be writing a book.  It would be huge.  I have to figure out how to exercise every day first before I write a book.  I don't have it like that. 
[01:03:30]  You put this in a book, it's going to be a huge read.  I'm doing it.  Because you have a way of talking about relationships.  No one else has talked about them in that way.  Yeah, it's from a guy with low self-esteem that has to have a pretty girl.  But that's the typical guy.  You're every dude, man.  Listening to Gene Simmons tell a woman that I'm going to have sex with other women is  irrelevant because he's the bassist in Kiss.  But you're a regular dude.  I mean, you're a funny dude.  But it's like people can look at you and go, all right, well, that makes sense to me.  It's very relatable. 
[01:04:00]  Right.  You should write a book.  And I do it with black women, too, which is a part.  Yeah, that's another whole trick, right?  They don't play around like that.  Yeah, I couldn't imagine how intimidating that would be.  Why don't you start dictating a book into a tape recorder?  And it worst comes to worst.  Is that how you did it?  No, I blogged.  But if you're not sure of how to do it, I kind of lucked in.  Because I want to do it.  I don't know how to do it.  It's not like I'm going, ah, shut up, Opie.  I don't believe it.  But it's just like I'm like, yeah.  But once upon a time, I don't know how to do that. 
[01:04:30]  Write down a bunch of thoughts.  Yeah, come out with like a basic outline of what could possibly be chapters of this book.  Start there.  Just write it and trim.  Just write a bunch of ideas.  Trim the fat later.  Stop.  Don't worry about make.  I always obsess over making the first paragraph.  Where am I going to go?  Just write a bunch of ideas down.  It doesn't matter if it makes sense.  And then you look at it in two days and go, oh, okay.  And then all of a sudden you start formulating from there.  And before you'll know it, a bunch of random ideas on a page turns into seven or eight pages.  And it will just kind of move itself, like going downhill. 
[01:05:00]  It's a no brain.  Yeah, yeah.  You'll be good at it, man.  If you just sat down.  I'm so not against it.  I'm just telling you.  If you sat down in front of a computer and just started trying to formulate something,  you're going to be surprised how quickly it's going to come to you.  I'm telling you.  And then we promote it and you become like a New York Times bestseller.  That's what we do for you.  Finally.  Finally we do something for you.  Listen, Roland is here.  He's telling everyone he had an Anthelini night, so he's a little rough.  What?  Around the edges.  Roland is here. 
[01:05:30]  He's a male radio host.  It says, very sluggish, very hungover.  He had an Anthelini night.  That's a quote from Roland.  Hungover.  He was at the Adam Sandler movie premiere or something.  Mm-hmm.  All right, so we'll talk to him next.  But first, it's the F.U. line.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.s.  You have seven new voice messages.  First voice message.  Hey, I want to give a big F.U. to my boss, Keith, who's always complaining about everything  I do.  Keith, you fat douche. 
[01:06:00]  F.U.s. you.  Next message.  Hey, I'd like to give a big F.U.s. to Brad for F.U.s. my mother.  You F.U.s. bastard.  Next message.  I'd like to say F.U.s. you to my manager, Hope.  I know how to do my job, bitch.  Stop being so moody, you men of all, but F.U.s. you.  Next message.  A big F.U.s. you to Stone Temple Pilots for leaving us waiting for an hour and a half.  F.U.s. guy.  Next message.  I'd like to leave a big F.U.s. to my old high school for screwing me over. 
[01:06:30]  F.U.s. you little a**.  Next message.  Yeah, I just want to say F.U.s. you to this lady in the front of the line trying to spend  her WIC checks when I just want to get a F.U.s. beer and go home and drink.  Next message.  Yeah, I want to give a big F.U.s. you to Anthony.  You're a millionaire and you got a fine piece of a**.  We get it.  End of new messages.  Call the Opie and Anthony F.U. line, 866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Thank you and goodbye. 
[01:07:00]  Hey, good morning.  Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton, Patrice O'Neill, Animation Festival tonight.  AnimationFest.net for all the animations later tonight, though.  Right now it's just a logo or something.  What was the other thing?  Oh, secret message to the XMers.  Yes, we're doing a show today.  Oh, because a lot of people are in town and they want to stop by and say hi.  They flew in for the Animation Festival.  Oh.  So, yes, we'll be doing a show today. 
[01:07:30]  But not tomorrow.  877-212-ON-A is our phone number.  Can I say that Patrice will write a book?  Yeah.  We got to get Patrice to write a book.  It's a no-brainer, right, Jimmy?  Yeah.  I'm in.  Jimmy gave me a nice pep talk, dude.  Good.  I don't know.  You know, it's not fear.  It's just, you know, you think about it.  Like, you just talk about dragon speaking.  I've done everything to try to upgrade my existence.  And I just think I'm really getting defeated thinking that I can't get any smarter than I am. 
[01:08:00]  You know.  No, you got to.  You know what I mean?  Yes.  It's called the megalomaniac syndrome.  Is that a syndrome?  Yeah, it is.  I was kidding.  Damn it.  You look at things as this overwhelming body, like whether it's a book or whatever.  It's like all of a sudden you look at something that you have nothing in front of you and you're  like, all right, the results are overwhelming and too much to do.  But it's like just if you chip away at it, as corny as that is.  That's very corny.  But it does not.  You'll be surprised how easy it's going to be, Patrice.  That's really.  And you got a way of.  But that's coming from a guy that is in the same world. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  I mean, Jim considers himself a haberdasher, but he's a bum.  But you know that.  Right.  Like, he knows I'm a lazy mush and I have no.  I really don't.  I mean, I'm a pig.  I mean, so he knows me well.  And if I can accomplish something, he certainly can.  I'm sorry.  I nodded a lot during that.  You were right to nod.  I was just nodding.  I was hoping that was an inner thought.  And then I realized, wow, I'm nodding way too much.  Yeah.  He's admitting all these horrific things.  He's going to bang his head on the microphone. 
[01:09:00]  O.B. has an intense span of seven seconds.  It's like, it's got to move, baby.  He's snoring.  Oh, no.  Nodding.  Not nodding.  Sleeping.  Nodding.  I was nodding in agreement.  I was like.  And then I realized.  He's calling himself a pig and everything.  I'm like, yeah, you're right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I need a chiropractor now.  He actually pushed the mic away from himself just so I would know to continue.  Hey, Jimmy Justice. 
[01:09:30]  We got to get into this.  Oh, he's the greatest.  We love Jimmy Justice.  And we're learning that he's an old fan of the show.  He used to listen to WNEW.  And his videos are all over YouTube.  And God, we love this guy.  He is a douche.  And I love him.  Yeah, we hate the meter maids.  We still call them meter maids.  Meter maids.  We hate the brownies, the traffic cops.  They're not real cops.  They're just there to make your life miserable.  They hang out by the parking meters and wait for it to go to what? 
[01:10:00]  What's the word there?  Zero.  Expired.  Expired.  And then they quickly write a ticket, even if they see you running with a baby carriage.  They don't give anyone a break.  They're just a bunch of asses.  And on the fail meters, they write on your tire.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  That's the other thing that they write on your tire.  Oh, yeah.  That's the other thing they do.  So they can keep up with the time that you were there at a fail meter.  Yeah, they mark tires and everything.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They put a little chalk mark on your tire.  And if it doesn't move.  Yep.  You know, I had one of these jerks give me a ticket because I was riding my bike on a pier. 
[01:10:30]  I was probably riding my bike slower than people were walking.  You know, just kind of on the bike and slowly kind of because I didn't want to get off my bike.  Yeah.  And she comes a run.  And I told this whole story already in a golf cart and wrote me up.  And I'm saying, look, I didn't know.  I didn't see the sign.  And she was on a power trip because she's not a real cop.  No.  Real cops don't, for the most part, aren't on power trips.  No, they won't screw with you like that.  But these nobodies, they get what they think is a little power and they take advantage of it. 
[01:11:00]  And then the NYPD, unfortunately, they had to make them look like real cops because people were beating them up for being asses.  Right?  Yeah.  So now they look like they're part of the NYPD.  They technically are.  But they don't have guns or they can't even arrest you.  They can't do nothing.  They have a car that says NYPD.  Yeah.  Traffic.  It's a small traffic up by the doorknob just to make sure.  I will blast by them at 90 miles an hour. 
[01:11:30]  Like, I could care less.  I'll rob a bank in front of one of them.  Like Walmart security.  Yeah, that's what they are.  Yeah.  And they have the NYPD logo and everything because it makes them look important.  It's kind of like the Celtics.  You've got the guys that are wearing the Celtic gear that plays on the team.  And then you've got the, like, you know, the administrators.  But, you know, if you look quickly, you're like, hey, is he one of the Celtics?  Get a little confused.  And that's what they want.  But this Jimmy Justice is putting these asses, these traffic cops in their place. 
[01:12:00]  I want to play the one from yesterday.  Then we're going to play a new one today, okay?  Just to bring Patrice aboard.  Listen to this guy.  He goes around New York City, Patrice, with a camera.  And his whole thing is waiting for these traffic cops to F up.  And then he gets in their face.  Listen to this.  You made an illegal U-turn in a business district.  You made an illegal U-turn in a business district.  And I have it on video.  Don't do that.  What kind of example are you for the citizens of New York?  You're a police officer.  You're not supposed to make a U-turn within a business district. 
[01:12:30]  Can you get out of my face?  You're not allowed to make a U-turn in a business district in the city of New York.  You violated the law.  You're supposed to.  You're supposed to arrest me.  Come on, arrest me.  I don't have the authority to arrest you.  But I have the authority to videotape you, call 3-1-1, and file a report against you.  Call him.  Call him.  I will.  Call him.  Call me.  Because I have it all on video.  Call him now.  You're supposed to enforce the law and not violate the law.  Get out of my face.  I'm going to get you arrested.  For what?  You videoed me, and I said don't do it.  I videoed you breaking the law.  I said don't video.  You're the one who broke the law and not me. 
[01:13:00]  Why are you mad at me?  The best part of that video, she goes, get out of my face or I'll get you arrested.  And she knows.  She can't.  If she called a real cop, they're going to be like, yeah, whatever.  I'll be there in four hours.  Yeah, what do you need?  Right.  Because we've talked to the cops.  The ones that are honest, they'll tell you.  They don't like these.  They hear them on the radio, and they're like, oh, I got a problem.  There's somebody hassling me.  I'm trying to write them up.  And the real cops will be like, yeah, I'll be right there.  And they don't show up.  They don't care.  It's the people part. 
[01:13:30]  Most concepts in life are pretty good.  What messes it up is people.  People.  You got to take the people out of the equation.  Communism isn't bad until the people.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, it works on paper.  It's just people who enjoy making your life miserable.  Yeah.  And these traffic people, it's like you put yourself.  I don't.  That's why I don't even beg anymore.  If something's going on, he's right.  I just start cursing them out talking about their African heritage, because most of them 
[01:14:00]  are Africans.  African heritage?  What's your move?  Oh, that's funny.  Shouldn't you be somewhere dying in a diamond mine?  It's like somewhere.  Oh, God.  I really am awful to traffic cops, man, because I have no respect for them.  That $65 is worth the pain and suffering that they get.  Yeah.  It's worth it, because she enjoys her job.  And, ah, sorry.  Nope.  Uh-uh.  And here's the one I hate out of all of them.  Oh, yeah.  I started writing it already.  Already started writing it. 
[01:14:30]  What does that even mean?  Well, you know what?  A couple of times, I've had them write down the wrong license plate.  Mm-hmm.  They wrote down the wrong number or a wrong letter.  Because you got them all flustered.  And the thing is done.  Yeah.  So they wrote down that somewhere there's $100 that's floating around that needs to be  paid.  Yeah.  It works.  Well, this rant continues.  But you can see your...  Oh, excuse me.  Yeah.  Like, she not only likes her job, but it's this phony sense of empowerment she has. 
[01:15:00]  That's why a lot of times a cop will give you a break, but she won't, because she has  no empowerment at all.  And this is a chance for her to get back.  And he picked the right one, too.  Oh, yeah.  Honey, chow.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Instead of just saying, you know what?  You're right.  I did make that turn.  That was kind of stupid.  But that would have taken every bit of wind out of his sails if she would have said,  yeah, I screwed up.  That was kind of dumb.  Or she said, I'm allowed to do that.  Yeah.  Yeah, or something.  Yeah.  I'm law enforcement.  I can do what I want.  Well, Jimmy Justice continues with this broad. 
[01:15:30]  You want to call 1911?  You want to call him?  You want to call him?  Let me see your badge number, please.  Yes.  I want your badge number.  Call him.  I want your badge number.  You made an illegal U-turn in New York City.  You're supposed to enforce the law, not violate the law.  You want me to call him?  Now you're going to drop in your radio.  You're a boob.  You want to call him?  You're a boob.  Do you want to call him?  A boob.  I will call them.  I want your badge number, and I will file a 3-1-1 report against you.  You forgot something.  Hello?  You forgot something.  Yeah.  Step out my face.  Okay?  Don't make illegal U-turns in New York City. 
[01:16:00]  Step out my face.  I asked you to step out my face.  Because real cops carry their purses on the job.  I asked you not to make illegal U-turns in New York City within a business district.  Who are you?  I am Jimmy Justice.  And your days of running around this city like a cowboy are over.  How great is he?  How great is he?  He's got a bit of humor.  What's the song at the end he's singing?  I don't know.  We'll have to.  What is it?  He rocked.  Oh, God bless Jimmy Justice.  He's the greatest.  I'm Jimmy Justice.  I would hate him if he was coming after me.  Oh, yeah.  But you've got to love him.  If we talk to him, I want to know. 
[01:16:30]  There's something or a series of events.  But I guarantee you there was one thing that snapped him.  And he's like, they are all going to suffer.  There was one phony sense of empowerment moment that one of these pigs wouldn't give him a break.  You don't feel like that, though?  Always, yes.  I feel like that about the TSA where I just, I want to do something just to stop them.  Yeah.  It's so frustrating.  I used to live in a brownstone and I would go away for the weekend and I would have to pull up in front of my brownstone,  double park, and quickly get my stuff out of the car, come back, and then I would go find a parking space. 
[01:17:00]  And put my parking lights on and all that, right?  I swear, one time I got a ticket, I was inside for less than a minute.  And I come out and there was a ticket and they were long gone.  They're not even around where you could dispute it.  I'm like, it's obvious that I'm just unloading luggage from the weekend.  It's even on a Sunday, so they're not stupid.  They know what people are doing on a Sunday.  And they bring in.  Getting back into town.  And it's like the devil's advocate where they just all kind of blend in after, like, he disappears.  They do disappear. 
[01:17:30]  It's like, hey, did you give me a ticket?  It's like, no.  So a lot of people heard that Jimmy Justice yesterday.  We're going to play a brand new one today.  And I think we're going to get him on the show today, hopefully.  So here's more Jimmy Justice.  These videos are linked on onaradio.com.  We have another one?  Yeah, traffic cop blocks a hydrant during a fire.  Wow.  And Jimmy Justice was on the scene.  Thank God.  Here we go.  I love him.  Are you on drugs?  What is your problem?  You're a traffic enforcement agent.  And you parked your official vehicle blocking a fire pump. 
[01:18:00]  And there's a fire outside with firemen out there.  And they have no access to the pump.  You ought to be ashamed of yourself.  You ought to be ashamed of yourself.  While you're in the store, you don't hear the sirens.  What's the matter with you?  You ought to be ashamed of yourself.  You're supposed to enforce the law and not break the law.  That's what I'm going to say.  What's the matter with you? 
[01:18:30]  Oh, is he just a bastard?  Well, you know what's great about this, too?  He knows there's nothing they could do to him.  Yeah.  There's nothing.  He's not cursing or threatening them.  Look, you do this to an NYPD cop.  Oh, boy.  You're going downtown for a while.  Yeah.  They'll figure something out.  Oh, they'll write you up for something.  And they'll make your life a living hell for a few hours, even if they don't have an official charge.  But with these things...  Cops have a little loophole that conquers everything called disorderly. 
[01:19:00]  Of course.  Right.  Where they tell you to do something and you do it.  Turn the camera off.  You don't do it.  Disorderly conduct.  Disorderly conduct.  That's that loophole.  And it doesn't matter if it gets thrown out or something.  It's just going to be a pain in your ass to have to be run through all the hoops.  If a cop tells you to do something, you don't do it.  It's a crime.  Right.  Yeah.  Disorderly.  Which makes your rights gone.  Every right is gone.  It destroys your rights.  Do that. 
[01:19:30]  No.  Disorderly.  Disorderly.  Turn that camera off.  Nope.  Disorderly.  Tased first.  Yep.  Dude, bro.  Bro.  Hey, okay.  I'll go.  I'll go.  I'll go.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Was it the same lady?  They all sound the same.  Yeah, they do.  I've got to be honest.  They all sound the same.  They all look and sound like they should be on a Sherry Springer show.  Fighting.  Looking for paternity or something.  And what bothers you is that with bill collectors sometimes or people that's just trying to help  you, like when they say the word can't, that's what gets sorry. 
[01:20:00]  Sorry now means nothing.  And the word, are you, you, you're not, are you can't stop this or you won't?  Yeah.  Is, just tell me you won't so I can feel better about how much I hate you.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Like, don't write this ticket.  I can't.  I just, I can't just stop.  You can't or you just will not stop.  Right.  Okay.  I will not stop.  Fair enough.  There you go.  You're a piece of garbage.  It's like white people voting for Obama.  Just say you didn't voting for him because he's black.  Just make me feel good once.  Patrice, we got Ken from New York. 
[01:20:30]  He says traffic cops are afraid to go into bad areas.  Now, I, I live on the Upper West Side.  It's a, it's a, it's a very white, safe neighborhood.  So these guys, these animals got the run of the place.  But I imagine these traffic cops in some of these scarier neighborhoods, I, I, I don't  think they're, especially when they're making out as regular cops, you know, they're not  getting batteries thrown at them.  I'm telling you, they're probably not making out as, as well as, uh, as these traffic cops  in white neighborhoods.  I think real cops write tickets in, in, in tough neighborhoods.  Really?  They, they don't even mess around with these, these things. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, they don't.  I don't think they do.  Well, they write them from the car.  Oh yeah, yeah.  A lot of these traffic guys will stay in the car where they have scanners now where they  can, they can write, they can, why is the city, why is the city making it safer and easier  for these, for these traffic cops?  Because it makes that money.  Because now it is a scanner thing where they don't even have to be near your car that long.  It's like, and they, and they, and they, and they put it right on the car.  I'll tell you what, the city loves these people.  They make them money.  Yeah, they make them tons of money.  Sure, I would love them too if I was getting the money. 
[01:21:30]  And that way, I used to get out of a lot of, uh, parking tickets.  Because they wrote them up wrong.  One mistake on there, you send it in, and that's it.  You don't have to pay.  If they scan it, now it's just, it's easy.  They push a couple of buttons, they scan it, all of a sudden, there's the make, model,  everything is correct on their ticket.  So, uh, it's hard to fight, uh, parking tickets when they scan them.  And then, now they got a, I don't even think the traffic user, but they, they got the,  uh, the tent little, uh, toy they have now. 
[01:22:00]  Which one's that?  They put the thing on your, on your car to see if your tent's legal.  With a, oh, if your tent is legal?  A tent meter now.  Oh.  They got a tent?  A tent meter that they like practicing.  But I'm glad I got a, a pocket full of FOP cards.  Yeah, well you need those.  Just hold up like a good hand in poker.  Yeah.  This is coming from, uh, from an officer, uh, acting in a tumultuous manner.  Tumultuous?  That's, uh, I guess what they can get you on if you, uh.  Anything they can make up.  Yeah. 
[01:22:30]  Just stop, tell them to stop it.  Acting in a tumultuous manner.  I love that.  Yeah.  That's a good one.  It's called the, the black guy documents that they have, that only Nicolas Cage has in  National Treasure.  Anytime a black guy starts preaching about rights, they just arrest you.  This is my new one.  Don't read the, uh, don't read the back or anything.  But this, look at this one.  That's a nice card, huh?  Well, let me, let me, let me show you a, uh.  Oh, you got a good one too? 
[01:23:00]  Let me see that card.  This one is beautiful.  That's a good card.  That is beautiful.  That's a good one.  By the way.  Okay.  Let me see.  This is.  But you guys should have better with Kenny here and, and Keith.  You got, you got, you, you deserve better.  That's a, that's a good one.  Well, let me see yours.  You deserve better.  PBA cards are like.  Oh.  Oh.  Did I see that one?  That one has, uh, white, white cops have the answer to that one.  Damn.  Yep.  Now, where the hell did you get this?  Keith's got a PBA card from the police commission.  All right.  I need, I need one of those. 
[01:23:30]  What is that?  It's made of gold.  I don't know, but it's gold.  It's, it's, it's, it's made of gold.  Yeah.  That's a PBA card made of gold.  That looks like it should be on your teeth.  I use, I use some of your, I use some of your cute plastic ones, you know, when I'm,  when I don't, you know.  This actually gets you out of a rape.  Yeah.  It's heavy and everything.  Wow.  Okay.  I need one of those.  This looks like it belongs around Flavor Flav's neck or something.  He could be wearing this thing.  I need one of those.  It's only not worked once in Pennsylvania.  Wow. 
[01:24:00]  Of course.  Wow.  Look at this thing.  That is heavy, like gold stuff.  It's worked in New York.  It's worked, it's worked everywhere except for Pennsylvania.  What happened in Pennsylvania?  The guy, thank God my girl was driving so she'd get the ticket, but it's like, I pulled,  I gave her that.  And, and it's, it, this is so powerful.  You can do the arrogant two finger handed over.  Like, take a look at that young man.  Excuse me.  And that guy, he's an old school trooper.  And I'm not sure, this is the new racism too, to go off track. 
[01:24:30]  It's the new racism black people have to get, have to learn how to understand.  It's covert.  I'm not sure he's being racist, racism.  Oh.  It's very difficult to deal with because he followed us for five miles.  He rode it on the, on the ticket and, and he, he clocked her at 80 and he said the device  that clocked herself, he just made a decision that we're going that fast.  And I gave him this card and he goes, we don't.  We don't, we don't recognize that.  I said, you don't, and I, oh, you talk about sounding like a white man. 
[01:25:00]  I went, this is not a PBA.  This is FOP.  You don't recognize fraternal order police.  Isn't this a brotherhood of police?  What about your family?  We don't give those out here in, in, in, in Pennsylvania.  We don't acknowledge this in Pennsylvania.  Oh, well, what a dick.  Oh, he was the worst.  Wow.  He must've really been a racist.  It was, it was, he followed, he, but his, he was racist and honest at the same time. 
[01:25:30]  Been profiling for six miles.  Been profiling.  That's right.  He wrote on the ticket, profile, followed.  Reason for stopping.  Black.  Yes.  He was, he was honest.  He stared at their dark heads, got angrier with every mile.  Assumed car was stolen.  And he just said that that, I went on the radio that day and said his name 47 times.  I forgot his, it was office or something. 
[01:26:00]  I read his badge number and everything on the air just, just to see, but not to say do anything,  but just say, is it, is it in Pennsylvania?  It's saying that they do not acknowledge FOP cards.  Wow.  But fraternal order, when you get a PBA, that's like, here, jerk.  You know?  Yeah.  I like you.  FOP is better.  FOP is like, hey.  With that, we got to take a break.  Patrice, are you promoting anything besides the animation festival?  Me and Bobby Kelly.  Oh, damn.  That's good.  That's going to be a good comedy show.  I know the one. 
[01:26:30]  Bob Kelly, you, Voss.  Mike DiStefano.  And Mike DiStefano is an animal that most of our listeners don't know much about yet.  Wait, is Voss on the show?  On that show?  No.  It's just from Bobby.  It's only Bobby, you.  Bobby, Patrice, and DiStefano.  And DiStefano.  Okay, I'm sorry.  And it's at the Count Basie Theater.  Red Bank, New Jersey.  Red Bank, yes.  It's on Monmouth Street.  And the show's at 8 o'clock tomorrow night.  Oh, tomorrow?  Yeah.  Well, a lot of people, the cool thing is there's like 1,800 people going to be at this venue tonight.  It's sold out.  And we got three comics.  We got Natterman, Russ Meneve, and then DiStefano. 
[01:27:00]  So a lot of people get to see a piece of Mike.  You get to see like 10 minutes of him.  Right.  Compared to like the whatever, the half hour, 40.  Yeah, I think tomorrow we all do like the half of 40, yeah.  Yeah.  And he's really funny, so tonight I'll hopefully start some tickets.  How do we get tickets for that there, Patrice?  I guess 732-842-9000 is the number.  Okay.  That's what I see here.  All right.  Or, yeah, contact Basie Theater in Red Bank, New Jersey.  Does Ticketmaster happen or you don't know?  I don't know.  Okay.  All right, good.  When we get back, more Jimmy Justice.  Also, I think we're going to get the man himself on the show, so stay there. 
[01:27:30]  It's Opie and Anthony.  Full house today.  We got Patrice O'Neill and, of course, Jim North.  And Roland, who I'm just talking to, who was at the Adam Sandler movie premiere last night.  Those mics aren't working.  That's why Patrice is sitting up over here today.  He's just telling me that there's some people that like Jim Norton.  I was very happy.  Wait, you were at, you are the dumbest person in radio. 
[01:28:00]  Let me just say that.  Wow.  You are the dumbest person in radio, Iraq.  That felt real.  Yeah, no.  He is the dumbest person in radio, and I'll explain in about a minute or two.  Because Iraq's microphone has cut out four times since we've been on the air, and he knows that.  And it's like, why are we starting a segment?  And I'm going to use a microphone that keeps cutting out.  It's stupid.  Wow.  Use your, I'll explain in a minute or two. 
[01:28:30]  No problem.  No, we're just talking to that one.  Anyway, go ahead.  Talk to that one if you want, and just keep cutting out.  Roland is sharing Jim Norton's microphone, because every microphone in the studio is not working,  except these in this area.  Or those, whatever.  So what were you saying, Jimmy?  We brought you inside the technical difficulties of the radio program.  Roland went to the Sandler premiere last night.  Ooh.  You know, Jim Norton's just popular in all circles.  No way.  Eh, you know. 
[01:29:00]  Stop.  Eh.  Who knew Jim Norton?  I don't know.  Roland.  Roland, who knows Jim Norton?  David Tyree of the Giants, the guy who caught the football.  Could he get closer?  David Tyree of the Giants.  He's the one that caught the catch.  Yeah, the miracle catch, sure.  Huge fan of Jimmy.  Yee-hees!  Yee-hees!  Jimmy-hees!  You had a rough night?  I heard you had an Anthelini night, they're saying.  Yeah, I'm standing through, like, afterwards, a private party at the New Plaza. 
[01:29:30]  The what?  Yee-hee!  Listen to that sound he makes.  At the New Plaza.  At the New Plaza, it was a very late night.  Yeah, I got home, and then by the time I put my head down, I heard Steve's phone ring, going,  where are you, and then I realized I didn't sleep, so it was a rough night.  Yeah, how was the movie?  It was good.  Yee-hee!  I'm about to say, I can't even listen to Roland talk anymore. 
[01:30:00]  He's giggling.  But he's very ticklish, for real.  Yeah.  And that's his real laugh when he gets tickled.  You don't even have to do it hard, you just gotta do it light.  Yeah.  That should come with cookies or a tree with some L's in it.  Yeah, get back.  He's doing hard, he doesn't like it.  Yeah, get back.  Like, let me just show up a tickle.  Yee-hee-hee!  That's gentle.  Get him on mic, though.  So you went and saw You Don't Mess With the Zoan, right?  Yeah, I was expecting not that good of a movie.  Yee-hee-hee!  It's a really good movie, though.  It's funny.  Really?  Rotten Tomatoes has given it 36% positive reviews. 
[01:30:30]  It wasn't that bad.  It was funny, though.  I was surprised.  Really?  You really liked the Adam Sandler movie?  Yes.  All right.  I bet you half of those bad reviews are just, are, are bad, because they think it has  to be.  Oh, Jesus.  Yee-hee-hee, listen to that laugh.  You shouldn't even laugh like that when a man is tickling you.  It just should be a, huh-huh, come on now.  It's the greatest thing we discovered last week.  Like, you, we, so, the mistake is you can't dig your fingers. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, my God.  This is real.  You can't dig your fingers into Tinker Booker.  Because he gets very angry.  Oh, he gets angry.  Right.  He gave Master Poe an earful and a bottle of water in the face.  He sure did.  He smashed water in Poe's face?  Dude, he smashed Master Poe like I've never seen someone smash.  Because here's the thing with Roland.  He looks a little soft and stuff, but if you get, if you push him, if you push him too  hard, he's not afraid of anybody in this room. 
[01:31:30]  I absolutely know not to go toe-to-toe with him.  Master Poe, we were doing the tickling bit, and Master Poe tickled him a little too hard.  A little background.  Master Poe lost a dog that basically was his life.  Oh, God.  And Roland was so pissed, he looks him right in the eye and goes, how's your dead dog?  Still dead?  No, he goes, how's your dog?  Is he still dead?  Yeah.  And then we all went, oh, and then when you listen to the replay, you can hear Roland  go, here boy, here boy, here boy, here boy. 
[01:32:00]  Just below the belt.  It was real.  I guarantee, though, Roland only laughs when people he likes touches him.  Again, he didn't like Poe coming in.  Well, Poe just didn't know his own strength.  He mauled me.  Yeah.  He what?  He mauled me.  Yeah.  He mauled me.  He made him give up CIA secrets.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Roland is just peculiar.  I don't.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[01:32:30]  He he he.  I discovered that by accident.  We were just joking one time, and I just tickled him as a goof because he's rolling.  Yeah.  And I heard the giggle, and I'm like, I can't ever stop doing this.  We love Roland.  He's really, really brought a lot to this radio show.  Goodness.  How did you know you were so tickling?  Yeah.  When I was a kid, my brother just started tickling me to death, and then I always made  that sound, so he always embarrassed me by tickling me from all my friends.  Have you seen Kung Fu Panda, by the way?  I haven't. 
[01:33:00]  I heard it's really good, though.  It looks funny.  It's getting 88% positive reviews on Rotten Tomatoes.  80?  88.  Yeah.  That's up there.  It looks funny, dude.  Yeah, Angelina Jolie.  Everybody's promoting it for all the little kids.  Now, back to E-Rock.  The reason you're the dumbest man on radio, we were setting up the tickling bit, and it  was quite obvious that we were trying to get Roland very close to Jimmy so Jimmy could  tickle him, and it's not going to work if he sits on the couch or takes the mic you  were trying to hand him.  E-Rock, comment.  E-Rock, comment. 
[01:33:30]  I don't know.  Last thing I heard during the break was, oh, you can use my mic, and you nodded okay,  so I thought that's what he was doing.  To be fair to Ope.  He's not a mind reader.  To be fair.  He's not a mind reader.  Roland, please.  We're being serious.  To be fair to E-Rock on this one.  Let's just be fair to him on that one.  That's almost.  No, we were setting up the bit during the break, and we're like, if he sits on the couch,  it's going to be, he's going to know what's going on.  Oh, he heard the. 
[01:34:00]  Yes, he should.  If he's sitting in the same room as us, we're like, if Roland sits on the couch, he's  going to know something's up.  If all of a sudden Jimmy decides to sit on the couch with him, because that's not the  normal setup.  E-Rock, did you have any clue that's what they was trying to do?  I know.  They didn't want him on the couch.  They said, what mic are we going to do?  No, no, no, no, no.  Were you clueless to the bit?  How does the tickle bit work?  Let's just put it this way.  How does the tickle bit work if Roland takes your mic?  Seriously.  I wasn't here that day.  You did it.  We were talking about during the break. 
[01:34:30]  I know.  You're in the room.  I got to side with E-Rock.  He's never been through the tickling process before.  He thinks it happens from afar.  What happened?  What?  I'm sorry.  He's asking me questions.  Jill came on to do the traffic there, and Patrice thought he was asking me questions about  her breasts.  Are you insane?  Because he's seen them.  Yeah, but see, you know what happened here? 
[01:35:00]  Jill was kind of just like a...  I have to say it again.  She was kind of like a sex object for the show.  Look, we made Jill TV, and we all like, oh, Jill, look what she's wearing today.  Look at this.  Look at that.  And now, out of respect, because it's become a thing, we've all faded away.  We don't even look at the TV anymore.  Anthony's the only one looking at her in the office.  Out of respect.  It's a whole respect thing.  He has to be fair to everyone.  We must all be able to draw from the well.  We just want to wet our beaks. 
[01:35:30]  Everyone looks at Jill Nicolini.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean...  Oh, I know that.  I'm not saying that.  I'm not saying, he knows, but I know Jill TV eventually will disappear.  No, I don't...  You sure?  That's fine.  It's just, you know, you're asking me certain questions.  I don't think I'm ready to, you know, to fess up.  I just asked an easy question.  I just asked...  You just asked Anthony about the boobs.  I didn't ask about any smells.  I just asked... 
[01:36:00]  You just asked Anthony about the boobs of his girlfriend.  They're officially girlfriend and boyfriend.  Roland, come on now.  What's up?  Why are you laughing?  All right, we got the master pole line.  So this is Roland.  You're hearing the ee-hee side of Roland.  Listen to the other side of Roland.  Roland has two emotions.  You must have touched him the same way his brother did.  Is he still dead?  What the f***?  This is the best transformation I have ever seen.  Oh, my God.  I should be in a movie. 
[01:36:30]  My condolences.  My condolences.  And like Jimmy said, if you listen closely, you hear, here, boy.  Here, boy.  He was.  He was pissed.  He was hot under the collar.  And Master Pole, pretty much a trained killer.  But that doesn't scare someone like Roland.  What were you prepared to do?  Because what you said is almost...  Like you could get hit for that.  Or you wanted to fight.  Like you wanted to fight when you said that.  I'm serious.  No, I wasn't going to fight him.  I know you wasn't going to fight him, but that's... 
[01:37:00]  When you say something like that, like, hey, how's your dead dog?  Yeah.  Which is almost like a dead son or dead parent when you're close to a dog.  Like, was you prepared to fight him?  No, I was prepared to fight him.  Like that.  Will you answer the question, Roland?  Please.  Enough with the laughing.  Look, Jimmy's over there.  No problem.  I know.  I wasn't going to fight him.  He was just going to go...  That really bothers for trees.  When Poe first did it, because Poe knocked Roland to the ground, tickling him. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  And Roland jumped up and threw his...  He threw his headphones at Poe.  It was just a reaction.  He whipped him at Poe.  And then Poe came over and was apologizing.  But Roland was so angry.  Because he doesn't mind.  He felt like Poe would try to, like, bitch him or hurt him when he jabbed him.  So he took the, like, half of the water bottle he had and he threw it up.  Poe's face.  Oh, yeah.  And then he just got next.  It was very, very impressive.  Extremely impressive.  I don't think he had a shower in a while, though.  Yee-hee-hee-hee.  All right, Roland. 
[01:38:00]  Because he kind of stunk that day, so it was kind of...  Wow.  So you figured he needed some water.  He did.  He didn't use the right soap or something.  Just, like, sweat.  All right.  Roland, thank you.  There's Roland.  Laughing Roland.  The greatest.  It's just me.  Wait, did his armpits smell or was it just his skin?  Just him.  I'm willing to put up my family crest that Roland's gay.  I refuse to believe that this guy is not gay.  I will forfeit my family to say that this guy is... 
[01:38:30]  He cannot not be gay.  He swears.  And I don't even care.  He swears he's not.  But there's no way.  He swears he's not.  I don't like the cock to the bisque.  Whoa!  Gee.  Whoa.  Was that off Mike?  Why is he forcing no guy giggles like that when you tickle him?  Well, that was a dump right there.  He said he doesn't like that scene.  He said that before, and I know it seems like I care either way.  The only reason I care is it's like, don't force me to go...  He's not.  With that tickle.  Oh, Jesus.  You know, some people... 
[01:39:00]  Steve from Bayshore.  What happened?  Patrice's family crest is a coconut shell with a bone through it.  Laughing.  He's willing to give it up.  Why do you think I just tossed it at these creeps with a family crest?  Oh, God damn, Steve.  All right, why don't we get back to Jimmy Justice?  Okay, do you want to fuck you, Roland?  Thank you, Roland.  Bye, Roland.  We'll get back in...  We'll get back to you in a while.  More Jimmy Justice.  So we got this guy.  He's in New York, and he's running around with his camera catching traffic cops, who most  of us hate, doing illegal stuff and getting in their face. 
[01:39:30]  Meter maids.  Sure.  Glorified meter maids.  Here's another traffic cop blocking a hydrant, and this is what Jimmy Justice did with this  person.  Oh, Y-Rock, hold on.  Y-Rock is really mad.  No, I'm loading the video right now.  Oh, okay, you had a really snarling...  Better be.  Oh.  Okay.  He can be mad all he wants.  Maybe he's got to listen more.  I don't care.  What do you think of that?  That's how you're supposed to do it, too.  So what?  I don't give a crap.  Just push YouTube, boy.  There's 10 people.  There's 10 people. 
[01:40:00]  Push YouTube, boy.  Hurry up, Kulta.  Just get Jimmy Justice up and shut your face.  That's right.  That's right.  Give us free.  No, give us YouTube, stupid.  There's 10 guys clawing at that door waiting to come in and take over.  That's right, Damon.  Damon Jasu, just shut your face and sit over there before we cut your foot off.  That's right.  Fucking hell.  Whoa!  We are losing control of this show today. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, wow.  Which is fine.  Jimmy just dropped the F-bomb.  Not even in thought.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what happens sometimes.  You just sit there and you blurt out the...  He got emotions.  You had to beat him out of emotions.  Oh, that's funny.  You know what?  Hey, Buffalo Wings George.  Buffalo Wings George!  Mike in Boston.  We were trying to figure out what to do with Giggling Roland.  Horrific news with Giggling Roland. 
[01:41:00]  Oh.  Where he has to read horrific news stories.  That's kind of good.  I like that.  Yeah.  Maybe we'll do that next week.  How's that sound?  Horrific news with Giggling Roland.  I got a guy in the NYPD way, way up yelling at me on my little phone.  He goes, stop calling them cops.  They're not...  I know.  That's why I said meet-a-maids.  They are traffic agents.  Okay.  Because I keep saying traffic cops.  They're not cops.  Thank you.  And I apologize.  They're the scum of the earth.  But they work in conjunction with the New York Police Department because they have NYPD on their car and on those little team trucks. 
[01:41:30]  And so do the big trucks that haul around the barricades, but the guy driving it ain't making no arrests.  NYPD is on it, so he is an associate.  That gets me every time, too, when I'm on the expressway.  You know how no one wants to speed past a cop, obviously, but you're on the expressway, and there's a big truck hauling barricades somewhere, and it says NYPD on it.  It's white and blue, and there's some guy. 
[01:42:00]  He's a truck driver driving it.  It's not a uniformed police officer driving it, and people are afraid to pass him.  They're afraid to pass him, thinking he's going to radio it in or something.  He's a May guy with that NYPD on it.  But he's not going to do anything to you if you blast past him at 100 miles an hour.  Who knows that?  Everyone should know that.  But not the average citizen who just goes, okay?  This morning, another time.  I'm driving to the Midtown Tunnel, and usually once I get past Van Damme, it's wide open, and I could really do just about 90 or so to the tunnel. 
[01:42:30]  I want to get in front of as many trucks as I can so I can get into the tunnel and not be behind those trucks.  So people don't want to move because they see a cop, but it's the postal police.  Every morning, they escort a big mail truck through the tunnel.  Well, the postal police aren't bums.  But they're not bums.  They are not going to pull me over.  Just like the guys for the tunnels, the tunnel cops. 
[01:43:00]  The tunnel, yeah.  Oh, I won't screw with them.  No.  You don't play with those.  No, no.  Port Authority cops.  Port Authority cops.  I won't screw with them.  Postal service police are not bums.  I've made a mistake.  They will not pull you over.  Yeah, unless you're driving with, like, letters flying out of your car.  Yeah, exactly.  No, but if you do anything to endanger that area of the truck, they're federal officers if they feel like the mail is being...  I was getting around the truck, and I pulled past the cop. 
[01:43:30]  No one wanted to pass him.  No one wanted to pass him because they assumed he was a cop that's going to pull you over.  If people aren't that against the law, I mean, I'll test it.  You'll test it.  I'll test it because I can't stand the law.  You'll test it just because you're a white guy, and you'll find out what the law is.  And not many people, many people believe that any time there's a siren...  Look, I get very angry at unmarked cars nowadays. 
[01:44:00]  There's some new unmarked pullover I won't do.  I'll drive to where I see the police, then I'll pull over for unmarked car.  Well, you got to watch out, yeah.  I think women should do that a lot, too.  I will not pull over for a car for a stingray with a siren.  It's not going to happen.  Have you had that where you just kept going?  I kept going until I found a real cop, pulled over, and the guy's yelling.  I go, I don't...  Dude, I feel what you're doing right now.  You're screaming, but who are you? 
[01:44:30]  I don't know you.  I don't want to be...  I'm not going to wait for you to identify yourself as a cop.  Anyone can pop a red light in the dashboard and...  Won't do it.  Will not do it.  You didn't get in trouble for that?  They understood?  He yelled at me, but I had my two-fingered...  Oh, excuse me.  Please take this.  That is a good point, though.  Put your hazards on.  I'm not pulling over for an unmarked cop car.  Put your hazards on.  Perhaps signal out your window that you do know what's going on.  And continue until you get to a safe area.  That's what I think.  What if you only have one finger up that works? 
[01:45:00]  One finger up that works?  That could be a problem.  That's ridiculous.  You can't just pull over for some dude.  No, because you don't know.  That's what he is.  Some dude.  Just day and age.  He's pulling...  And they're doing it a lot now.  People get jacked like that.  Yes.  If I may use the word jacked.  It ain't going to happen.  How you doing?  Creep.  All right, we got another...  That was Jared.  Jesus.  Jared.  Coming in to bring Patrice some food.  He calls him a creep.  How you doing, creep?  Yeah, let's do another clip from Jimmy Justice.  Another traffic...  See, the reason I keep saying cop is because it's written that way. 
[01:45:30]  Another traffic agent...  Agent.  ...blocks a hydrant.  All right, Kizzy, hit it.  Jimmy Justice.  Is something wrong with blocking a fire hydrant?  Don't you think there's something wrong about filming somebody?  No.  No.  I think you're a police officer who's supposed to enforce the law, but you violated the law  by parking your official police car...  Well, you do what you have to do, okay?  ...blocking a fire pump.  Somebody else would get a ticket for that.  What's wrong with you?  Excuse me.  What's wrong with you?  Thank you. 
[01:46:00]  T-D-U-L-A.  Pop, what are you doing?  Move away from the vehicle.  I'm filming you breaking the law.  Ms. Dula, you broke the law.  Yes, thank you, sir.  You broke the law.  Thank you.  What are you going to do, bite me with your gold tooth?  Oh, no.  No, he didn't.  You could just do that.  You could.  You just broke the law.  You have all right to do it, okay?  I'm going to do that. 
[01:46:30]  Thank you.  And I have it on video.  Thank you.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you.  You made my day.  You made mine, too.  Thank you.  Okay, bye-bye.  I'll say this.  She collected her.  She was fairly as calm as you could be with somebody filming you.  She was all right.  All three of them have been big, fat women, though.  All three of these people.  Yeah, what is that?  They can't pass any physical tests.  No.  They just sit there.  They get these orcas to just sit in the car and write.  They're fat.  They get to sit there and just write. 
[01:47:00]  They don't have to do anything.  They're all big, fat brides.  I'm sure they're also looking for someone that's going to be a bit intimidating looking.  Yeah.  You're not going to get a little cute little white thing that's anorexic.  Yeah.  No.  Why is that a large majority of the traffic enforcement agents are African-American?  I don't know.  Why is that?  Put them at risk.  Is that what it is?  It's a put them at risk cannon fodder kind of a thing?  Nobody cares about Africans. 
[01:47:30]  Not even black people.  Yeah.  So just put them out there on the lines and let people yell at them and throw stuff  stuff at them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  What's up with the chopped meat hairdo, by the way?  Chopped meat?  It's awful.  Oh, my God.  Don't look at me.  Perfect.  Don't look at me.  Holy Jesus.  That's perfect.  To defend African hair.  What?  It's a mess.  It's a new look they're doing.  Chopped meat hairdo.  It looks like Sharpie dots.  It's...  You go to the supermarket, you see that chopped meat 90% lean or something. 
[01:48:00]  It looks like ground beef.  It looks like they're taking up a package of that and just going on the top of their head.  Smashing it on top of their head.  Ground beef.  Will not...  Ground beef.  Let's call it the ground beef slash chopped meat.  Perfect.  Hairdo.  That's one thing I'll give white people credit for.  Introduce products.  Unbelievable.  All right.  We got Jimmy Justice standing by.  We got one more clip from Jimmy Justice.  Oh, good.  We were going to spend 20 minutes on this thing, but this show is just kind of like...  Wee!  It's good.  Yeah, absolutely. 
[01:48:30]  It's adrift and we don't know where it's going, but that's all right.  Patrice O'Neill, Red Bank, New Jersey.  Show tomorrow night with Mike DiStefano and Bob Kelly.  Bob Kelly, yes, sir.  Red Bank, New Jersey.  At the Count Basie Theater.  There you go.  Tickets still available.  Not many, though.  No.  You might want to get your tickets immediately.  Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Patrice just saw himself animated.  I'm really excited about it. 
[01:49:00]  We're very excited, man.  What do you think of yourself animated?  Dude, whoever drew it, and this is what, I guess, bothers me.  It looks just like me.  There's no denying it's me, but they detail.  Whoever did this one detailed things that I don't like about myself.  Yeah, they always do that.  Those bastards.  Yeah, they sure do.  I'm like, wow, they know I got a mole on my face.  Great.  It looks fantastic, though.  Yeah, it was really good.  It was really funny. 
[01:49:30]  I'm biased now, because I'm just going to sit there.  I shouldn't even look at that, so I don't know what's coming, because I'll be sitting  there going, all right, I want some more of me.  But it was great, dude.  There's a couple where you're in at least a still picture of you.  There's one on the good, the bad, and the ugly thing that's really great.  That one's going to start to show.  The problem with the animations, though, is they show you exactly how the world sees you.  Oh, isn't that horrible?  Like, I convince myself of certain things, and I'll see one cartoon and go, oh yeah,  you are a moose. 
[01:50:00]  That's how everyone sees me.  Yeah.  How many are there?  We've got at least 20.  And did you?  And I think we're going to show all 20 tonight.  Now, did you cancel any out?  Yeah, we canceled a few out that we're still going to put up on animationfest.net later  tonight.  All the animations will be up there after the festival's over.  I think a couple really didn't cut it, you know?  Yeah.  There was one that was just extremely stupid.  Which one?  Maybe you don't want to blow up the guy's spot.  Poor guy.  Whatever.  Because we're very appreciative that these guys have spent many, many hours on these things. 
[01:50:30]  But it's stunk.  All right, listen.  We've got one more Jimmy Justice clip.  We're trying to do tragic news with Tickling Roland or whatever we're going to call the bit.  We might squeeze it in before the end of the show today.  Wait, oh, do we have Jimmy Justice on the phone?  Yeah, we got him.  Okay.  I just want to play his last video, and then we'll go to Jimmy Justice.  How does that sound?  Jimmy Justice, traffic agent, parking in a no-parking zone while she runs into a Rite Aid.  Why are you taking a picture of me?  I'm taking a picture of you because you're a police officer who's supposed to enforce the law. 
[01:51:00]  No parking?  And you parked your police car in a place where the sign says no parking anytime.  I'm taking a picture of me.  And you're not doing your job.  I'm taking a picture of me.  You went into the Rite Aid.  I can go into the Rite Aid.  Because you don't know if I have a feminine problem.  You don't know if I have any type of problem.  Right.  You don't know if I have my asthma, if I need my medicine, or anything like that.  You don't know my business.  Right.  So if you have to go...  But no, it's funny.  That's the excuses people use.  Yeah, exactly. 
[01:51:30]  Look, my kid is having an asthma attack, and I need to get something.  So I understand.  I don't care.  I don't care.  Right.  Absolutely.  That's why this bit's so good.  I started writing.  I already started writing.  That's why this bit is brilliant.  Or move it.  Yeah.  That dismissive move.  Yeah.  Right.  God bless Jim.  Enough.  Right.  Or anything like that.  You don't know my business.  Right.  So if you have to go in the Rite Aid...  So if I went in there and I have my period, I can go in there.  Right.  And you don't have to park properly.  You're allowed to park.  I am parked properly.  But if the sign says no parking anytime...  A handicapped person can park in or no parking. 
[01:52:00]  It says no parking anytime.  Are you handicapped?  How do you know that?  I could be handicapped.  If you're handicapped, are you efficient at doing your job?  Because he's sitting there taping me.  I'm having a problem with racist Jimmy Justice, though.  Why?  Why can he find somebody other than this woman?  Probably not.  It seems to be...  It's the same woman, but it's different, but it's the same exact...  But that's everyone that I've encountered, too.  Patrice, I've been this woman.  I've seen some wormy white boys, too, now.  Not breaking the law.  Patrice. 
[01:52:30]  Fair enough.  Honestly, I can't remember the last time I saw a traffic agent that was white.  I'm just being honest with my...  Just my dumb life.  But it's the same woman.  I don't see them.  I don't see...  I see a lot of big, black, fat women.  With the chopped meat hair.  Who's the guy jumping in here?  We missed this.  Yeah, we're getting there.  Okay.  Here we go.  The shame is that somebody else would get a ticket for that.  I could get a ticket, though.  If any regular person parts where it says no parking any time, they'd get a ticket. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah, you're right.  Yeah.  And you know what?  I'm on the supervisor.  She's in a marked vehicle.  A marked vehicle is permitted to park here.  She's not in a bus stop.  She's not nowhere.  She's in a no parking.  Not for official business.  Everyone else to park here, so she can.  But even if she's going into the store.  You park a regular passenger vehicle?  Yes.  You park your vehicle here?  Yes, you will get a summon, sir.  No problem, sir.  She's doing her job what she's supposed to do.  The vehicle is legally parked, sir.  The vehicle is legally parked, even though it says no parking any time. 
[01:53:30]  Sir, is she a passenger vehicle?  I'm Jimmy Justice.  I'm Jimmy Justice.  With that, let's say hi to Jimmy Justice.  Jimmy.  Hey, good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  How are you, buddy?  Well, I've been better.  If it were years ago when you guys were on in the afternoon, I had to wake up really early in the morning.  But other than that, I'm doing great.  And it's an honor to talk to you guys.  Ooh, Jimmy Justice is lazy.  He doesn't like getting up.  Jimmy Justice has a drinking problem.  You know, Jimmy Justice is not lazy, but he works until late at night and I usually don't wake up this early. 
[01:54:00]  How many videos do you have?  We love these things.  Yeah, we're obsessed with you, Jimmy.  I have on my computer probably about 20 or 30 hours of these confrontational videos.  Wow.  Now, what exactly, we've all dealt with these awful, disgusting people.  What incidents sparked you to just go on the rampage with a video camera?  The incident that sparked me to go on this rampage is about two years ago when I witnessed a traffic enforcement agent write a civilian, a parking summons, for blocking a fire hydrant. 
[01:54:30]  And then the same traffic enforcement agent got into his official vehicle, he made a U-turn and parked blocking a different fire hydrant on the other side of the street, and then went into a restaurant to eat lunch.  And I said, there's got to be something wrong with that.  Yep.  So you kept your video camera on you at all times, and any results happen because of this stuff?  Like, what do you do with this stuff? 
[01:55:00]  Do you dial 3-1-1, or what has happened because of this?  Oh, yeah.  Very often I do dial 3-1-1, and it's not enough to just dial it and file a complaint.  You have to keep following up on that.  Otherwise, they're not going to do anything about it.  And I've definitely seen a reduction in the rate of recidivism in areas that I have frequented with my video camera.  And since the major media have also picked up on this, recently the mayor and the police commissioner have directed the internal affairs division of the police department to write summonses and tow the vehicles of city workers and police officers who are illegally parked. 
[01:55:30]  See, to me, like...  They are taking action.  A regular cop in a marked squad car is different because they're just cops.  But, I mean, you treat these people the way they should be treated, which is, like, they're not like cops.  No.  They want to be able to do what they want to do and still write tickets for the same thing.  We just listened to the woman who had her period.  Like, it all pointed out the same excuse that any other person would give she gave, and you just had a video camera on her. 
[01:56:00]  It's great.  And the reason they would write you up for being in front of a fire hydrant is because they want to keep the fire hydrant clear in case there's a fire.  So then they park there?  How does that make sense?  It doesn't matter what's parked there.  Right.  You're not supposed to park there.  Right.  It doesn't make any sense.  And, guys, I've always said that some of the laws don't make any sense, but some make a lot of sense.  And the laws of not blocking a fire hydrant are, it's not rocket science.  Right.  You don't do that because in case there's a fire, you need the firemen to get in there and be able to do their job quickly. 
[01:56:30]  So what's the difference if it's my vehicle blocking a fire hydrant or if it's the vehicle of a traffic enforcement agent who's in the McDonald's two blocks away?  There is absolutely no difference.  You should not block a fire hydrant.  Have you had any bad incidents or no?  Have I had what?  Any bad incidents with these traffic people like, you know, where they get physical or anything?  Oh, absolutely.  I've had a lot of physical altercations. 
[01:57:00]  Besides being yelled at and cursed at, which is perfectly okay because that's what I do to them.  I've been spit at.  I've been pushed.  I've been threatened with arrest.  I've been followed.  Have you gotten anybody fired, hopefully?  Well, interesting enough, if you saw the video I put on YouTube called Miss Anderson Breaks the Law, and that's the woman who gave me the middle finger.  And while a retired policewoman came over and told me I'm not allowed to videotape anyone employed by the police department because of terrorism. 
[01:57:30]  Well, that sergeant from the Traffic Enforcement Agency, her name was Edith Anderson, and actually a few months after this video, she was arrested with two of her sons for selling crack out of her apartment.  And this can be verified if you look up Edith Anderson on the New York Post police blotter.  And this incident happened a few months ago, so I'm not making it up. 
[01:58:00]  So, Jimmy, what is the law like?  Like, when the one guy said, we just watched one where she parked to run into a Rite Aid or whatever, and the guy came over and said, well, it's an official vehicle.  Now, are there any times where they are allowed to be doing that, or are they pretty much always lying when making excuses for themselves?  Okay, there are times, because there is an exception written into the law that sanitation enforcement agents and traffic enforcement agents are allowed to double park or do other minor violations with their vehicles while they're doing their job. 
[01:58:30]  And that does make a little bit of sense, even though it's not fair, but if they have to go into a highly congested area to write summits to others who are blocking the roadways and causing a hazard, you know, sometimes they have to be there for a minute or two while they're writing their summits.  So that loophole is written into the law, and they're allowed to do that, but not when they're running their personal errands.  And they shouldn't even be running their personal errands while they're at work.  So they're doing two things wrong. 
[01:59:00]  So basically, like, if they park in a no-parking-anytime zone and they're standing out there writing a couple of tickets, they're allowed to do that, but they're not allowed to block a hydrant because that's not a minor infraction.  Exactly.  They're never allowed to be in a bus stop, and they're never allowed to block a hydrant, but they can be in a no-parking or a no-standing with a time signature, like if it says no-standing from 3 to 6, for example.  Sure.  Looks like you studied this stuff, Jimmy.  Oh, yeah, I do know my stuff, and I know the bounds of what I can and cannot do. 
[01:59:30]  Have you seen or actually confronted any other traffic agents besides just fat African-American women?  Yeah, you know, my opponents have accused me of being a racist.  Well, someone in studio just said that.  Well, I mean, I only saw four videos, and they were all the same giant African woman.  With the chopped meat hair.  I want to keep saying that.  She should have baskets on her head.  Yeah, that's not my fault, though. 
[02:00:00]  What you see in my videos is just a microcosm of the demographic, and the fact is that most traffic enforcement agents are black women with big tushies.  Yeah, fair enough.  Big tushies.  Just put up something else.  I don't know.  Special endeavor.  What other races have you encountered?  A little bit.  A little bit.  What other ethnic group have you encountered on your journeys?  Well, I have to tell you that the videos that I put on YouTube were some of my more colorful clips. 
[02:00:30]  Right.  Because I did want to create a little bit of a buzz.  And obviously, I put my best foot forward and put some of my better clips on there.  And the most colorful exchanges I've had were with black women.  And that's just a coincidence, I think.  What's your favorite one that we could play?  Because we don't want to go through 30 hours at Jimmy Justice.  Oh, yes, we do.  We're lazy.  Well, one of the better exchanges were you could play a little bit of the one called Traffic Enforcement Agent Makes Illegal U-Turn.  Okay.  Oh, we did. 
[02:01:00]  We did that one.  Is that what you said?  She was a boob?  Yeah, that's the one I called a boob.  Yeah, we saw that.  We love that one.  Or the best clip that I've ever had is a traffic enforcement agent who went into a restaurant to stand in line and order her lunch.  She blocked a fire hydrant.  And while she was waiting in line, a fire actually broke out across the street.  We heard that one, too.  Well, you gave her the business.  Yeah, we picked the good ones, then.  Yeah, I read her the riot act.  Yeah, absolutely.  The riot act.  What do you do for work, Jimmy?  I'm an audio systems engineer. 
[02:01:30]  And I also play guitar in bands.  All right, so this is just kind of something you do for fun.  You don't even make money off it.  Where do you sell DVDs?  I make a little bit here and there when I license some of my footage to television networks.  Also, people have gone on my YouTube page, and there's a link to my blog page.  And people hit a donate button and donate money to me through PayPal.  So I've made a little bit of money.  Not a lot.  It's really funny what you do, man.  And just the fact that they're so belligerent. 
[02:02:00]  Instead of just...  Have any of them went, you know what, you're right.  And it was kind of stupid that I just did that.  And just acknowledged it.  Like, really taking the wind out of your sails by kind of going, for lack of another  old lady way of talking.  Has anyone ever just said, ah, you know what, that was kind of stupid?  Facial endeavor.  Actually, that's never happened.  Really?  Okay.  They're always...  You know, some of them are not so belligerent.  They see me coming with the camera, and they're completely quiet.  They just get in their car and drive away.  But for someone to actually admit that they were wrong, that has never happened. 
[02:02:30]  God, it's great.  I hate them.  The more I watch your videos, the more I hate their guts.  So please just keep...  Until we have a few traffic agent suicides, I'd like you to keep going.  Yeah, Jimmy, right on, man.  Thanks for calling the show today.  Where's your website?  Where can people just check these out?  Yeah, what's the plug?  Sure.  Well, if you go to Google and just put in Jimmy Justice, the top thing that comes up  in the search will be my YouTube page, and you can take it from there.  Okay.  Very nice.  Thanks a lot, man.  Thank you, buddy.  All right.  Have a great day, guys.  You too.  Jimmy Justice on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:03:00]  That's great.  Yeah.  We'll have that link on onaradio.com, of course, of the videos we played.  Jimmy was a little sleepy from dishing out justice, it sounded like.  You know what?  Anyone that chases these animals with a camera and just makes their lives miserable...  I just love people that could find a little niche for themselves.  Yeah.  Who would have thought of that?  It's great.  It's definitely great.  And they're miserable.  We've all dealt with them.  I remember I was going to an airport.  I was late for a flight.  Look, I know that they hear a million excuses, too.  They deal with the public who sucks.  Mm-hmm.  But just the indifference, the way that they're not real cops, and you know you're never going 
[02:03:30]  to click with them because they're not real cops.  Yep.  A real cop kind of has an intuition and can sense...  What makes you think you click with real cops?  Because I've had enough times where my excuse was real, and I needed to do something with traffic-wise,  and the guy, because they've questioned suspects, and they kind of have an intuition for when  you're completely being a fraud and when you're legitimately stressed, and they'll occasionally  cut you a break because they don't need the power trip of making you go straight instead  of a left that badly.  Yeah.  Because they pull it out another way. 
[02:04:00]  I'm not saying that they can't be dicks, but they'll let you go a lot faster.  Yeah, you can't break...  You got a chance anyway.  I mean, with the traffic agents, you don't have whatsoever a chance.  Right.  I know what he's saying.  Real police don't bother you about your seatbelt.  Unless they happen to see it.  Right.  The phone is another thing, but the seatbelt...  Yeah.  You know...  No, Patrice is right.  You see the cops looking at you, and they see you don't have a seatbelt, but they're  like...  The real cops just don't...  I don't need to do that.  I'm going to go bust some guy for selling crack soon.  I make turns like if there's a road, and for some reason they're not letting people 
[02:04:30]  make a right turn on it, but I see other people on the road, it's not like the road  is closed, I'll make a right, even though I see the traffic enforcement agent waving  people off.  You're just a criminal.  I won't look him in the eye.  I'll just make my turn and go.  And I see him going, hey, hey, you know, stop.  Go that way.  No.  Has anything ever happened?  No.  Well, one time, the agent got to the back of my truck and went, bum, bum, bum. 
[02:05:00]  And I just kind of put my hand out the window and waved, like, oh, yeah, okay, I know  I made the turn.  Right.  Hey, I, I, I, entitled.  I, I, one time was late for the comedy cellar, and they were blocking off the area down by  the low part of the village, and there was no reason for it, because whatever it was  wasn't happening.  And, uh, usually, look, you tell me, I'm a comic, I'm, I'm actually down here working,  I'm not just, whatever.  They'll usually, they, they understand you're not lying.  But this one traffic cop, nope, gotta go straight.  And I, as I, I parked and I had to walk by him to go, and I understood how people just act 
[02:05:30]  violently towards other people.  Sure.  Like, he probably had maced and would have maced me, but I really, I wanted to go over  and just drill my fist in the side of his face, and I'd take the arrest.  I, I don't know if I've ever wanted to physically attack somebody that badly.  Wow, you are bad.  But I didn't, of course.  Of course not.  Because I'm not an idiot, and he probably could have beaten me up.  Hey, with that said, because we're running out of show, uh, we're going to attempt something  live.  We probably should, like, you know, polish this up a little bit, but, yeah, what the hell.  When have we ever done that?  I know.  You're absolutely right.  We got Roland back in studio. 
[02:06:00]  We're, uh, we're going to attempt to do a bit here.  Here, uh, Roland, you got to use Jimmy's microphone.  And, uh, we got an intro on everything?  Oh, yeah.  It's basically, what, Tragic News with Roland?  Yes.  All right, Tragic News with Roland.  Uh, Roland, you're going to need some headphones, believe it or not.  You're going to be a real broadcaster right now.  Do we have, uh, headphones for him?  Yeah.  Wait, here you go.  There you go.  Uh-uh.  And here we go. 
[02:06:30]  T-N-N, the Tragic News Network.  Tragic News Network, with your anchor, Roland.  You're just, he's just staring at the microphone.  Anytime.  See, that's your, wait, hold on.  We're going to start over.  See, Roland, that's your big intro, and then you're like, hi, I'm Roland.  You've got to introduce yourself, you know.  It's your whole, uh, opening.  Yeah, yeah, this is your bit. 
[02:07:00]  Here we go.  We'll try it again.  Oh, jeez.  Was that probably the most obvious cue?  I think so.  To start in on?  I think so.  Like, you didn't really have to be told?  Yeah.  All right, we're going to try again.  Here we go.  Take two.  T-N-N, the Tragic News Network.  With your anchor, Roland.  Hey, it's Roland.  Teacher dies minutes after finishing 36-year career.  Hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee. 
[02:07:30]  An elementary school teacher retiring after 36 years career died of a heart attack moment  after saying goodbye to her final class for the summer.  Hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee.

[02:08:00]  Smith was a fourth grader teacher  at Milano Park Elementary School  where she worked since 1972.  Principal Alice Woodward  said students had not gone  more than five minutes before.  Smith complained about  shortness of breath.  And this was cold.  In other tragic news,  Colorado boy burned by invisible fire? 
[02:08:30]  Oh my god!  In cold dust at heart.  Cold dust sparked  an invisible fire  that heated the soil to 800 degrees  and burned the feet of it.  An eight-year-old boy  fired fire set.  Matt Borinsky  walked into the fire Monday 
[02:09:00]  as he was playing in the park  among the plastic clogs  to one of his feet  and left them with second-degree burns.  There were no smoke or flames  which led firefighters  to suspect an underground mine was burning.  mining experts and geologists  ruled that out of  rolled out  but found a two-feet-deep layer  of coal dust.  Yeah. 
[02:09:30]  Oh, in other news!  Let's see.  Oh.  Ochoa man charged in  shower electrocution?  My ass!  The woman said  she sustained  several  electrical shocks  when adjusting  the taps  in the shower  on Sunday.  When she complained 
[02:10:00]  to her husband  he allegedly told her  it was a  build-up  of static electricity.  He he he he he he he  The next day  she discovered  a section of a drywall missing and electrical wires attached.  And...  Put in your bathroom.  Choked.  Police allege that the woman she confronted her husband, he choked her almost to unconsciousness.  That's so crazy, man. 
[02:10:30]  Oh, my God.  Manhattan.  In other news, Manhattan, a 62-year-old man was arrested for repeatedly molesting his  step-granddaughter.  In the Lower East Side apartment, authorities said yesterday the man allegedly fondled a  12-year-old girl in his home, Jackson Street, between March 1st and the 15th. 
[02:11:00]  In other Manhattan news, the perv was busted Monday on charges of sexual abuse and endangering  the welfare of a child.  Oh, my God.  DA spoke for him and said.  And other news.  Finally, is this your last story?  This is the last story of the day.  All right.  Finally, yeah.  Go ahead.  Launched 30 feet over an intersection, a man wanted, in connection with a broadside crash,  that launched a motorcycle list. 
[02:11:30]  30 feet into the air, nearly...  Nearly killing him.  Go on.  Surrendered after a series of local sex reports.  Investigators said, Jarrell Brothers ran a road by an intersection of Delon and South Street  in Tutsville, Udo.  No. 
[02:12:00]  Where?  Right there.  And?  Where am I?  And slammed.  Oh, my...  Sweat's in my eyes.  He's got sweat.  He's sweating.  Oh, he's sweating like crazy.  Because he doesn't like to be at the center of any...  All right.  Uh, Tutsville and slammed into, uh, Charles Udo while he's riding a motorcycle.  Oh, Udo was found critically injured at the scene.  Oh, Lord, man. 
[02:12:30]  Local six showed, uh, the Udo getting hit, being launched over vehicles and throughout an intersection.  Um, after the, um, intersection.  After the accident, brothers ran from the scenes and remained missing until Local Six  and LocalSix.com ran reports, the police said.  It was one of those things, uh, where we had no choice, Tutsville Police Detective Victor  Rodriguez said.  A lot of people were looking for him.  We had Channel Six with Donald Forbes, and we received a lot of calls. 
[02:13:00]  Rodriguez and said brother's girlfriend apparently talked him into turning himself into the police.  Yee hee hee hee hee hee.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  And that's it?  And those are the stories.  Wow, you know what?  That's...  For our first try, not bad whatsoever.  I like it.  All right.  Thank you, Roland.  How could it get better?  Unbelievable.  Roland is sweating profusely because he doesn't like to be the center of attention ever.  He's got sweat in his eyes that...  Yeah, he's got to wipe out the sweat. 
[02:13:30]  His eyes are burning.  That made it hard for him to read.  All right, that wraps up today's show.  We've got the animation festival tonight, animationfest.net.  All the animations will be up there later tonight.  Patrice O'Neill, great job today.  As always, we've got the big show tomorrow, Count Basie Theater, Red Bank, New Jersey.  You, Robert Kelly, and Mike DiStefano.  It's going to be a great show.  Tickets still available.  Count Basie Theater.  I'm hoping Bob is legless from his trip to Iraq,  and he has to be wheeled out. 
[02:14:00]  Dad, you know what?  Dad!  It'll be a great show.  Absolutely.  I think that's it, right?  Yep.  All right, we're going over to XM Satellite Radio.  Radio, radio.  Well, we're going to be here tomorrow, sure.  In one way or another.  Yeah.  XM 202.  Let's listen in to a menage a trois  featuring a reverse cowgirl butt-fucking  while the butt-fucker gets his balls slapped into the butt-fucky's vagina. 
[02:14:30]  Today's boner is brought to you by Evil Angel's Deep Fatal Abyss,  directed by Jay Sin.  Oh, yes!  Oh, this is going to be so fucking deep!  Yes!  Yeah, I want to see those fucking balls  snapping on his fucking legs.  Yes, yes, yes, yes.  Yeah, you're killing that fucking cock.  Kill that cock, baby.  That's today's boner on the Opie and Anthony Show.  In the world of Radio Shock Shocks,  the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things 
[02:15:00]  that border on offensive  in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here  and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio,  out of any other medium,  have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard  where we have to be nice  and make people feel good.  Shock Shocks.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys,  Opie and Anthony.  Controversial Radio Personalities,  Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs,  Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts,  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:15:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks,  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks,  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks,  Opie and Anthony.  Paris,  you were strip searched.  Was the search  of something we like to call  the old two-hander?  Did they do the old  grip and rip?  This is where  payment is going.  What is that?  extreme camel toe.  Oh, God damn.  Oh, God, you got a complete camel toe.  If you are here, give us a sign. 
[02:16:00]  My wallet is gone.  Oh, my God.  It's with us beyond the grave.  It's time for people to understand  these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Opie and Anthony, XM Satellite Radio.  Welcome aboard.  Thanks for coming.  We got a huge crowd right outside the studio.  And, you know,  and you're hearing half the crowd 
[02:16:30]  because Poe decided it was perfect timing  just before we go live on the air  to take half the crowd  and move them to another part of this floor  to fill out dumb paperwork.  Are you kidding?  Well, let's see what happens.  I always say check the facts  before you jump the gun.  We're just about to start the show,  which is pretty much the coolest thing  to check out  if you've never been here before.  And right before the intro,  Poe's like,  come on, follow me.  Yeah, yeah, leave.  And just have the crowd empties. 
[02:17:00]  Hold on, let's ask Poe now.  Dummy.  Let's give Poe a chance  that maybe there was a mix-up.  Dummy with karate skills.  Poe.  Poe, what, what, uh,  because I know you couldn't have  just pulled him away  because we've had this discussion  80 times.  Foot Fist dope.  That'll be funny in another few weeks,  trust me,  when everyone sees, uh,  Foot Fist way.  All right, so what happened?  A little obscure.  Why are we doing this now?  Um, well, I went downstairs  a little late  because I was speaking to my boss.  And when I did go downstairs,  I brought up as many as I could,  I think around 15. 
[02:17:30]  And I started the paperwork right away.  And then I had to get the other batch.  What time did they, uh,  first come up?  Hold on, who's your boss?  And who, and what were you talking about?  Yeah, who's boss?  Uh, my boss, Bruce.  All right, he's a softie.  And what did he talk to you about?  Yeah.  Well, he, he just wants to know  what goes on here.  And I have to give him an idea  of what, what happens.  Was Bruce explaining  why he has hair like Paul Reiser?  Uh, no, no.  I didn't think so.  But anyway, I, I brought them up here  looking for the answer. 
[02:18:00]  Uh, how long were some of you guys  waiting out there?  Let me get a couple,  just bring in a couple random, uh,  who was out there for a while, Dan,  if you could find out.  Any guys out,  waiting up here for a little while?  Anybody?  Yeah.  How long have you been here?  Uh, since 8.30.  Oh.  8.30.  Okay, 8.30.  And how about...  Anybody else?  8.20.  Do we have...  8.20.  Do we have an 8.17 out there?  Just, uh...  I just want to know.  Who was the first person here today?  What time? 
[02:18:30]  7.30.  7.30?  Okay.  7.30.  Anyone, uh, all right.  How long were you guys  all waiting outside?  Yeah.  All of you...  Some of you are waiting outside  from 8.30 on?  Yes.  The Steinway people  thought we were here  for a piano seminar.  Yeah.  Why would they look at this group  and think you were...  Oh, my God.  ...for anything  other than this?  I don't know.  All right, so 8.30.  But know what I'm thinking, Jimmy?  Like, the animation festival's tonight.  And usually when we do, like, 
[02:19:00]  some kind of gig,  we know people are flying in  from all over the country.  And I just know  we're going to have  a huge crowd that day.  And I don't understand  why other people  don't understand the logic  that there would be  a huge crowd  and maybe go downstairs  a little earlier  and then go,  I think there's going to be  a big crowd.  I've got to start  my job earlier today.  Well, 8.20, 8.30  to 9.17,  that's 47 to 57 minutes.  Plenty of time  to get everybody up here  and everyone's paperwork done.  You know, done.  You Johnny come lately  has exploded, of course,  but in general. 
[02:19:30]  So, yeah, that's what we try.  We like the energy of the crowd  to be there when we start the show.  We don't want the listeners  standing outside  like a bunch of douchebags.  We want them to be able to sit.  Yeah.  So it's like I saw  a bunch of them disappear.  Standing room only today, Jimmy.  Look at this.  Look at this.  Look at this.  Yeah, very happy.  Can we get some seats for them?  Well, we're going to move  everybody in here  and we've got that  big, huge, long couch.  That's what we're going to do today.  Yeah, but what should we do?  Oh, look at that.  That gets some applause.  Thank you, Jimmy. 
[02:20:00]  Wow.  All right, so yeah,  we'll maybe bring in  the bleachers in a few minutes  and some of these little  sweeties that are standing  will get seated.  I'm a little nervous.  There's too many people  to perform.  Oh, they'll be too long.  You think that's a lot.  Yeah, we got, what,  1,800 tonight?  Perhaps, yes.  I thought it was 1,200,  but you were saying 1,800 earlier.  Maybe I was wrong.  I think you might be right, Jimmy.  I don't know.  All right, Paul,  thank you for whatever you do.  Yes.  Thank you, guys.  Who's the master?  Master Pooh.  Oh, yes.  Paul? 
[02:20:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah, we can't have that.  Mm-mm.  I'll go home  and get your fucking shine box.  Wow, they laugh at sound clubs.  This could be really easy.  Which one do you want to hear?  All right, we got Patrice O'Neill.  Yes, of course.  Should we start moving them in?  Yeah, why not?  Start moving the people in  because this is,  we're trying to find our way anyway,  so everyone up.  We got Pat Duffy.  Let Pat Duffy get the...  Oh, no, and a guy with a name tag  is going to fucking try to help out here. 
[02:21:00]  Who's the guy with the name tag?  I don't know.  Get girls in here at least.  Jesus.  Get girls.  Sorry, it's not the type of show we do.  One, two, three.  I see three.  Yes, this show ought to be called  80 Cocks to Every Cunt.  By the way, we should tear down a wall.  Jim Norton saved our careers today.  We were doing Giggling and Rolling  with the tragic news,  and Jimmy said,  whoa, you shouldn't be reading that story.  And it's not from a personal point of view  because a personal point of view,  my sense of humor is fucking horrendous, 
[02:21:30]  and I love them.  Just got to understand the climate we're in.  Yeah, it's just like I know  certain things are going to come after us  for like dinner.  Yeah, you don't even have to say what.  Yeah, exactly.  But just know that Jimmy probably  saved his show today.  Wow.  Because we were just quick  to just try to get the bit on  as fast as possible  because we knew we had something there.  I didn't even know what the story was.  I know what it probably involves.  You could imagine.  Some type of child thing.  No, no, no.  It was a man running,  and he fell down,  and he hurt both of his arms.  Wow.  Let me just soak him up on for a second. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah, exactly.  That was a devastating bomb.  Cock me.  All right, they're getting the bleachers in here,  and the fans are going to fire in.  That's the way XM put the fucking XM logo  on all three levels of the bleachers.  Yeah.  Product placement for anyone's asshole that can see.  Like they won't know where they are.  Product placement for the brow guy.  Of course.  All right.  Of course that shit ain't got a lot.  They're all going to say Wonderama. 
[02:22:30]  All right.  I love this.  All right.  Pile in.  Okay.  Wow, they're piling in.  That's right.  We got like 50 people here today, man.  That's right.  Oh, look at everybody sharing.  I love this.  Aw.  E-Rock.  What's wrong with E-Rock?  No, nothing.  Besides the obvious.  Get that cold so somebody can sit in these chairs.  Yeah, yeah.  Let them take every inch of space.  For everybody who doesn't have a seat,  they shouldn't be forced to sit Indian style on the floor  like a class picture.  Fucking.  See, we probably should have brought the big, long couch 
[02:23:00]  in front of the bleachers.  Because the bleachers are a little higher, but...  They can't see our faces back there.  Good.  That's all right, though.  They could stand.  Well, we got one seat over here.  We have a black gentleman standing in the back, sir.  Considering your bravery.  He's so short.  How could you tell he was staring at Jimmy?  Oh, Jesus.  He's a little fella.  You've been here before, haven't you?  Okay, cool.  Yes, he's a regular.  We see him all the time on the walkover.  Do you hate me?  I guess the comfy chair.  Patrice, thank you. 
[02:23:30]  It's a bit white in here.  I'm sorry.  As opposed to what?  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  She's just comfortable.  Every other day.  I think we got black listeners.  I think they're just scared to have hair with us.  They come to my shows.  They're very, very quiet.  They say,  We listen to O&A.  Then they scoot.  Without any proof.  Yeah.  David Tyree, obviously an O&A listener.  Who?  Did I say his name?  Yeah.  Funny comic, dude, David Tyree.  No, no, no.  He's the guy.  I don't know if he said his name right,  but he was the guy that made the miracle catch in the Super Bowl. 
[02:24:00]  He's not a fan of mine.  He's also a comic.  Who?  Oh, so you were right.  David Tyree is also a comedian.  Different names.  Probably different people.  No, same.  Different guy?  Different people, but no.  Oh, okay.  David Tyree is a comic.  And also.  Oh, David Tyree is also,  he's the man who plays football.  This is the thrilling stuff that you get to hear when you,  holy shit, who cares?  You're right.  Tommy Duong, Tommy Chong, Tommy Wah, fucking Charlie Chan. 
[02:24:30]  Toby, Toby Wong.  Pete Pappalardo, my agent, says 1,800 tonight.  Really?  Yeah, so.  Oh, now I'm nervous.  Everybody that's here going, is that it?  Of course, that's why they're here.  That's the big thing.  Wow, is this the whole crowd?  Where's everybody from?  Like any interesting faraway places?  Exactly.  Pat Duffy, this guy raised his hand.  Where are you from?  Reno, Nevada.  Hold on.  Oh. 
[02:25:00]  Why would that mic work?  Why?  I tried again.  Reno, Nevada?  Yeah.  Oh, very cool.  Are you flowing just for the animation festival?  How far from the Bunny Ranch, which is in Carson City?  I grew up about 15 minutes from there.  We used to go there and drink and party when I was in high school, because they were the  only ones that would serve us.  So you would only drink?  Would you fuck?  No.  We'd go there and get tours and stuff like that.  Tours?  You know.  What are you, a faggot?  They'd show us a few.  Jesus.  Yeah, what do they give me the fucking, they let you go in the laundry room and smell the 
[02:25:30]  shit shit?  Take a tour of a vagina with my dick.  That's about the only tour.  That's like going to Disney World and getting a tour of the rides and not actually going on  the rides.  Yeah.  That's kind of dumb, man.  We were high school students.  We didn't have any money.  We just had enough beer money.  Oh, it was a cash thing.  Yeah.  All right, cool.  Strapped for money.  So they fucking, they take, what do they take you on a tour and they show you through  the window?  Yeah, show us their room, show us the dungeon and the spa room.  All right, here's a man bringing home syphilis to his wife.  Well, that's pretty cool.  We start arguing with them about politics and current events and we're like, ah, you're 
[02:26:00]  a hooker, what do you know?  And they end up throwing us out.  That does trump everything, no matter how small the hooker is.  A hooker can say anything, but the foreign policy dick says, shut up, dick sucker.  Point you.  So what kind of work do you do, sir?  I'm in my own business.  I manufacture jewelry findings.  What?  Manufacture jewelry findings.  Jury or jewelry?  Jewelry.  Oh, jewelry findings?  Yes.  What the fuck is that?  Clasps and toggles and stuff.  Well, say clasps. 
[02:26:30]  What the fuck is a finding?  I used to be a casino host.  I'm finding you boring.  Jesus.  You asked.  No, but don't worry, I didn't know a jewelry finding.  So you were a casino host, and what happened?  I got sick of it.  Got burnt out.  Oh, okay.  All right.  And who's the sexy girl with you?  My wife.  Oh, she's very pretty.  Thank you.  All right, we'll leave her alone.  No, I'm being very nice.  We don't have many women here.  We only have one, two, three, four, five.  All right, we got six, seven.  Back there, yeah.  And in the back?  No, why would there be? 
[02:27:00]  Six out of the 50 or whatever.  Yeah, you're right.  All right, who else we got?  A bunch of shy little...  Anybody else from a faraway place?  Or an interesting story?  Got Liza Minnelli from Arthur Hair.  Oh, yeah, hold on.  Back there.  Hold on, that woman in the back.  She's very cute.  She has her short black hair.  Hello.  Hi, how are you?  John Popper's here, too.  We're from Rhode Island.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sitting here, too.  Rhode Island?  Yep.  What do you do in Rhode Island?  Work.  Psyche steel ties. 
[02:27:30]  Make jewelry findings.  Look at her, Anthony.  There go a girl you would have went after back then.  That's pre-Nicolini.  There you go.  She's pre-Nicolini right there.  A suicide girl.  Oh, yes, indeed.  She's nailed it.  And likes the suicide girls.  That's fine.  Yeah, fuck it.  What do you do for work?  I'm an assistant in a hair salon.  Oh, okay.  You're very cute.  Tell me that's your boyfriend or husband.  Boyfriend.  Okay, he's got a little pierced nose.  Sorry, do you have a Prince Albert in the old cock?  No, not big enough.  Not big cock? 
[02:28:00]  Oh.  That's an honest man.  Oh, no.  You couldn't get a little teeny ring?  Even children have earrings.  You couldn't grab a little stud or something and just tape it to the head of your dick?  No.  Go back to the girl.  How small is he?  He's just fine.  No, I'm sure he's a good lay, but how small?  How disappointed were you when you saw him naked for the first time?  How did she love you, man?  Nah, he does spine work.  He's just missing the back.  He does spine work in that area.  Yeah.  Like myself.  Just missing.  Just missing.  She wished she was a little... 
[02:28:30]  Put a dick out of an extension, man.  You gotta smash into that cervix.  They do.  Like fucking...  Use your fingers if you have to, buddy.  Oh, that's a given.  Don't get her pregnant, because your baby will be translucent.  Jesus Christ.  White people.  Your fans are white.  But you want to talk to John Popper?  You said Patrice.  Well, just look at John Popper over there.  Oh, jeez.  And I can't take my arm over this guy, because he looks like the dude that shot Eric Boghossian 
[02:29:00]  in Radiant.  Oh, you're dead, fucker.  Good show today.  You had a guy that just looked back like I'm not talking to him?  Oh, shit.  Hey, can I get you all right now?  You're dead, fucker.  That was scary.  Holy shit.  Psychopaths.  Can we get that audio drop?  You're dead, fucker.  That is a creepy, creepy man.  Yeah, he was great.  Otto's friends with that guy, of course.  Who?  Rockets Red Glare.  That's his name, right?  That's a stupid...  It's probably a stage name, though, I'm going to guess. 
[02:29:30]  Perhaps.  So, who's the guy in the back?  When Opie said, does anybody have an interesting story, that little doll in the back raised  his hands, a little bespectacled sweetie.  I did not have an interesting story, but I was just saying...  Tell us how you swallowed your harmonica.  What did Anthony Anderson say?  What's that?  That was a good one.  He had no faith in it.  Yeah.  You should have fucking went for it like a soldier, buddy.  But here's the mistake.  Too many of these guys even know who the fuck Anthony Anderson is. 
[02:30:00]  There's only one black guy that would laugh at that.  Yeah.  You ever, like, any girls you ever work and get raped in a movie trailer?  That's Anthony Anderson.  So, sir, what were you going to say?  Just tell the joke.  Who cares?  I was just going to say, I'm from Chicago.  I flew in.  So.  That was the joke?  No one said I had a joke.  And the plane's wings are killing it.  And my arms are tired.  It's a fat joke.  He's a big boy.  He's a big boy. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah.  Yes, he is.  Sorry.  What do you do in Chicago?  Uh, I'm an animator.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  You are CokeLogic, aren't you?  Yes, he is.  You're CokeLogic?  No.  Oh, my God.  I would have.  Oh, I would have been CokeLogic.  I would have been much nicer.  And we're calling John Papa.  Absolutely.  What the hell's wrong with us?  Thank you.  As soon as you said CokeLogic.  It's holy shit.  We're meeting someone famous today.  As soon as you said CokeLogic.  We met in CokeLogic.  And as soon as you said Chicago, I'm like, eh.  I didn't want to say CokeLogic. 
[02:31:00]  And have you go, no, I'm just another one.  Are you going to bring him on today on stage?  Hell, yeah.  I think we should introduce him on stage.  And CokeLogic, I got to tell you, I think yours is in the running.  I really do.  Fantastic.  Don't bias the judging.  No, not at all.  No, let it bias.  But he animated a Ramon call.  And how he did it is really, really funny.  The big reveal is very funny.  Yeah, he won't say what it is.  Yeah, I'll stop right there.  I'll give it away.  And then it's, whatever.  What are you doing?  Yeah, exactly.  What are you doing, Patrice? 
[02:31:30]  My baby judge.  Nothing.  Kenny, when I tell you to drain the water out of this, you know what?  You can't get good help.  Here's what it is.  When I get my tuna fish, I like the water drained out of it.  So it's nice.  Yeah.  Nice and dry.  But look.  Yeah, like, yeah.  Look at this.  I said drain the water out of it.  I said drain the water out of it.  He pissed at it.  Jimmy, you do know what that means.  And it's going to be awkward because we've got a big crowd here today.  God damn it, you're right.  It does mean a bare-bottom spanking. 
[02:32:00]  Not a bare-bottom spanking.  I'm really sorry you guys decided to come here with Kenny messing up.  Oh, there we go.  Well, you know, he's got it.  How about you keep that close?  Oh, great.  He fucking...  If you thought we were kidding, Kenny knows.  Right, Kenny?  Yes, sir.  I have to take my medicine, G.H.  Yeah, but why do I have to take mine?  You want to do a paddle, Jimmy, or you want to go bare-handed?  I'm going to go bare-handed because I have tuna on my fingers. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah.  So he'll have some explaining to do when he gets home.  Travis suggested that perhaps somebody from the crowd might want to spank Kenny.  Okay.  No.  No, it's just Jimmy.  Yeah, it's personal.  It is personal.  This is great.  He's got a service revolver by his left hand.  I'm going to paddle his fucking rotten hiney.  All right, here we go.  All right.  A bare-bottom spanking for Cope Soda Kenny.  Wow, look, everyone has their cameras up by hand.  They think this is terrific.  Jimmy pulling up the shirt.  Yeah. 
[02:33:00]  All right, so where should I put the...  The handprint?  Yeah.  I say each cheek has to get a little discipline there, Jimmy.  And he takes a really hard smack, too.  This is not going to bother him at all.  Now watch this.  He's trying to goad me into hitting him harder.  Yeah.  He's like, every time I hit him, his dick jumps a little bit.  He's tightening up his butt cheeks, too.  What about the other one?  I know. 
[02:33:30]  It's there.  That's called the old bait and switch.  Yeah.  Kenny nothing yet?  No, Jimmy's got a loving touch.  See how it makes it jiggle?  I think that's more punishment for Jimmy.  That's more punishment for you, right, Jimmy?  No, it was sexy and fun.  He has fucking awful cloth boxers.  I couldn't...  He couldn't wear unsexy or underpants if he fucking tried. 
[02:34:00]  Just wear diapers and shit in them.  They'll be on the same level.  I couldn't take my eyes off the gun.  He just laid it on the table.  Yeah, no kidding.  Club Son of Kenny, everyone.  He's a security guy.  Kenny doesn't fucking play games.  With the muzzle pointed right at somebody.  Guns rule.  Jesus.  I know.  That meant nothing to you, did it?  No.  Hey, we got a big enough crowd to do sitcom rules today.  When somebody walks in.  Yeah, you guys, your whole job is to applaud characters coming on.  And then they have to...  To do his thing.  But the people also that are coming in have to understand they have to deliver a quick line. 
[02:34:30]  And then stop until the applause die down.  And then repeat what they said and we're cut off saying.  Should we try with E-Rock?  E-Rock.  Yeah, let's do it.  Okay, but it's gotta be like a...  Not yet!  Get back outside!  E-Rock, you suck.  Holy shit!  He's in his own world.  He came barging in.  And that's why I have to sound like the asshole this morning.  What a buffoon.  In his own fucking...  They don't laugh too hard at that. 
[02:35:00]  Jesus.  It's millennium.  I'm kidding.  I didn't mean it.  All right.  So, yeah, Eric, you gotta...  Eric, you come in.  You have to deliver a line when you come in.  And then you have to stop because the audience is making too much noise.  Wait, he needs a microphone, though.  We gotta mic him.  Yeah, Eric.  Give...  No, E-Rock.  Give him the mic ahead of time.  Pat Duffy's going in.  Yeah, please, Pat.  Oh, Master Poe's going to throw a monkey wrench into the works.  Of course.  Well, Eric, you gotta fill out paperwork.  He's going to throw a monkey wrench into the works.  All right. 
[02:35:30]  Okay, like...  All right.  It's like Lenny and Spooky.  A line would be given, and then you'll know it's your cue to walk in.  Just use your instincts.  We got the animation festival tonight.  We got a great audience.  That's right.  I wish an incompetent slob was here.  Yeah.  Hi, guys!  Hi!  But he blew the whole way it was supposed to be done.  Yeah, of course he did.  He has a fucking hat like Vic Morrow in Blackboard Jungle.  And he walks in and he goes, hi, guys! 
[02:36:00]  And now a line, E-Rock.  He had to give a line.  It was supposed to be a line, and then you had to stop because they're applauding, and  then you gotta stay...  It's very difficult to do.  You either have a brain...  Is Danny gonna do it?  No, I just wanted to use a better mic.  Oh.  He either has a brain tumor, or that hat really is getting smaller.  Hopefully both.  Put some gutters on it.  The hat with gutters.  You killed me the other day with that one.  What do you got there, E-Rock?  I have a piece of audio for you.  It's also on Broadway Day, too.  That's right.  That we didn't really go with. 
[02:36:30]  Booing him.  Boo.  What happens in Long Island by Coke Logic?  You just handed this in?  No, we played it before.  Oh, we're just replaying it.  Okay.  Don't talk to us like that.  Oh, bless you.  Bless you.  What's going on there?  Thank you.  So many choices.  Well, Coke Logic is here, and he did put this together for us.  What happens in Long Island?  You know what?  I gotta wipe the snot off the CD cover so I can read this.  I think Coke Logic should come and sit at the table. 
[02:37:00]  Oh.  Wow.  Wow.  What an honor.  Oh, my God.  In a seat of honor.  Wow.  Here's Coke Logic.  That doesn't happen very often, to be honest with you.  He's done so much good work for the radio program.  Coke Logic looks like a lesbian.  Holy shit.  Let me stop fucking with him, man.  This guy's a genius, dude.  I'm sorry, Coke. 
[02:37:30]  Oh, no problem, sir.  You said not to fuck with him after you just really just hammered him.  Yeah, I'm bad about him again, man.  His cartoons are a genius.  They really are.  I love his style.  Yeah, here it is.  What happens in Long Island?  Anthony Cumia is a radio host.  He thought he had it all.  Drinking guns, whores, gay guys.  It was insane.  Until one day, she could stun this jock jock with a message.  I come up with a message for Anthony. 
[02:38:00]  Oh, from Jill?  She said she is A, single, and B, interested.  Sense from a traffic girl.  They call me Network and Nicolini.  With giant cans.  I'm recently single.  Why can't I get them?  I'm calling to pass if maybe Anthony wants to go out.  Now Anthony's on Cloud 9.  My pal Anthony is deeply in love with Jill Nicolini.  He's changing his ways.  I've been hearing that you're having a hard time with children these days. 
[02:38:30]  And he's ready to betray his beliefs for a piece of ass.  People know me off the air as really loving children.  I have a soft spot for kids.  Yeah, I love kids.  The more the merrier.  Anthony Cooney.  Can I point out how great it is that this whole time Anthony was just trying to wrap it up before one of us wrecked it?  Yeah.  Jill Nicolini.  Also debris spill.  Lots of delays here.  Taking up the left lane.  Traffic is definitely going to linger longer.  Akeep the Cop is the jilted lover. 
[02:39:00]  Another disgruntled employee.  I forgot.  All disgruntled.  ONA Pictures presents  What Happens in Long Island  Stays in Long Island  Coming to a theater near you  Oh, bravo.  I love that movie trailer delivery is fantastic.  What was the moves, man?  I missed this whole fucking thing.  You're still pissed because you gave Anthony this advice a long time ago and he didn't take it.  He waited for Mick Foley to give him the words. 
[02:39:30]  Mick Foley.  Uh, we talked on the air briefly.  I said I'd give her a call.  I heard about that.  My girl was telling me that Mick Foley was the same zip, but I didn't put nothing together.  So we text a little bit and we went on our first date, which lasted for 35 hours.  So you went out and then what was the horse shit, like the violin?  When did the violin music start?  You know what I'm saying?  The violin music.  Well, uh, I picked her up and, you know, the Escalade and then we drove to a restaurant.  She wasn't impressed, by the way, which is cool because she's been picked up. 
[02:40:00]  Of course, of course.  This is a good thing.  This is good.  Your money hasn't impressed her yet.  Exactly.  So this is good because she can get high level motherfuckers.  So I'm, I'm, this is.  Yeah, that's exactly.  All right.  So then we're driving.  I had a little faux pas when the navigation system sound had to be turned up and I turned  it up and didn't realize that Aureo's speed wagon was on the radio.  Okay.  That's really a kind of a douchey moment.  But she likes Aureo's speed wagon.  But she laughed at that.  Yeah, of course she did.  It was funny.  And then we went to the restaurant.  She's a lonely traffic girl at this point. 
[02:40:30]  Go ahead.  At this point.  Restaurant, a couple of glasses of wine to loosen up.  And I don't know.  The next thing I know, we're like fucking making out.  What?  In the restaurant.  Making out in a restaurant.  Now, did you have any fucking, has there been any comfort zone at all since you've been  with her at all where you just, your mojo's there where you're just like, oh, all right.  Where you're comfortable.  Oh, fuck, all the time now.  In your own fucking skin. 
[02:41:00]  Totally.  Dude, he doesn't care.  There's not even an awkward moment or anything.  Yeah, he doesn't care who's around.  He's been making out in public ever since.  Yeah.  Look how dry his lips are.  He's some chapstick.  I want to ask you some dirty questions so fucking bad, my friend.  No kidding.  We all kill.  There's a difference.  See, it's weird.  With people on television, and I don't realize this, but people think the same way of people  on the radio.  They're different in regular life than they are on TV.  You see them on TV.  Really, Anthony?  What the fuck is wrong with you?  You do, but no.  You get intimidated a little by the celebrity of certain people. 
[02:41:30]  By the fact they're on television.  They're looking at you like you are Anthony of Opie and Anthony.  She knows.  But she's not the same person you see just delivering the traffic.  You know?  It's like, yeah.  Are you giving me a schooling?  No, because you can't get like the...  I'm not schooling you.  We're talking to fucking people through these microphones.  I'll have a conversation with you.  I want to talk to you.  I really want to go in the bathroom and sit down with T and talk to you about this fucking  situation. 
[02:42:00]  With T?  Yeah.  I'm still, by the way, a very...  I am starstruck.  There are some horrible women I would fuck just because...  Like, I fuck Barbara Walters.  Just because she's a celebrity?  Because she's a piece of garbage and she's fucking people and I fuck her because she's  90-year-old Barbara Walters.  I'm a novelty guy like that.  But Jill Nicolini, man, this situation is just super interesting.  I just don't want you to fall...  Optimal word, fall. 
[02:42:30]  Mm-hmm.  In...  Optimal word, in.  Like quicksand.  Love.  Not in quicksand.  Please.  I'm saying fall in.  Where...  No falling in anything.  Okay.  He fucking nose dove into it.  What are you talking about?  Did you say you love...  Did you say I love you too or I love you?  Let me think.  Let me think about it.  What you should have said was, I like you so far.  Now, just because I'm being lovable doesn't mean you are too.  Yeah. 
[02:43:00]  I might have strayed from some of the Patrice rules on this.  Of course you have, but you don't...  Just don't go too far.  Because I'm not Patrice.  Don't know if...  I know you...  Look, Jill Nicolini is high, high level, man.  Right.  I mean, no question about it.  That was definitely out of my tin knocker days.  Out of that range of any girl I would...  What's out of your range as a radio guy?  But she is...  She's ready, dude.  She is ready to have a man.  She is there.  I say you get her pregnant. 
[02:43:30]  Wow.  It's not the first person saying that.  I say you fucking get Jill Nicolini pregnant.  Really?  And then you got her for sure.  Why, though?  Do I want...  Yes.  Why do I want to muck up the body?  Muck up what body?  You got enough money.  Jen Norton's.  What the fuck do you think?  Send her to one of these fucking construction companies and get that stomach fixed afterwards,  then.  Are you kidding me?  She looks like she got good genes, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  Get her pregnant.  Without a doubt.  Yeah.  Just cut the tip out of the condoms and go, oops. 
[02:44:00]  Condoms?  You don't need to.  She wants to have a kid.  Dude, dude.  Condoms?  What are you, crazy?  No bags, huh?  Oh, get out of here.  Good boy.  This is nothing.  You went and robbed, did he?  Why not?  Already?  So she...  What do you think?  So she's going to get pregnant.  She's going to wait for you.  I don't care.  She's trying to get pregnant.  Well, who knows?  She might be on the pill.  You don't know that.  She ain't on no fucking pill.  Anthony may pull out.  He doesn't.  Pull out.  Pull out where he would never pull.  I haven't pulled out in all my life. 
[02:44:30]  He wouldn't dare put that anywhere except for inside.  I used to use the old thumb trick where as you're pumping out, you put your thumb under  the condom and foosh, that fucker comes right off.  You're back in.  The chick never knows the condom came off.  Shoot alone.  But you don't even need to do that trick here.  Done.  No.  And you never got a girl pregnant?  Lucky me.  There were a few scares back in the old high school days.  Wow.  I missed my period.  Hold on.  Ow.  Stop kicking me in the stomach. 
[02:45:00]  I got to get in there.  I got to get into this now.  For a guy who doesn't want kids, that's taking some crazy chances.  Dude, you ever have $30,000 on a blackjack hand?  It's the same feeling.  Come on.  Come on, blackjack.  Because I want kids and that would scare the shit out of me, knowing maybe the time  wasn't right or whatever.  Would it?  You really have taken chances like that.  Oh, I only fuck during periods. 
[02:45:30]  We learned something today.  I want it to look like a strawberry fribble coming out of there.  I like this.  I like this.  I like this.  I like this.  I like this.  I like this, man.  You liking this, Patrice?  I'm liking the fact that you stay a piece of shit.  Because this could risk changing Anthony to be like, hey, I don't want to talk about  things like this.  Very fucking good, man.  This is how you stay.  You got to stay you.  Anthony will be a father and married.  Two things.  He'll marry, let me tell you why he'll marry this. 
[02:46:00]  Because this, he feels like this is completely out of his league and logistically.  It is, but it's not.  Right.  But it is.  I'm being honest.  I understand.  But in all due respect, this is a big leap.  It's a very big leap from, you know, from me.  Because you know you're better than...  I could have worked my way up slower.  Yes.  Gone from like the News 12 traffic girl. 
[02:46:30]  He went from zero to 60.  But what this does.  Wait a minute.  What this does.  He found the cheat codes.  I just want to jump in there.  The cheat codes.  Yeah.  Fuck spending all this time.  I got the cheat codes.  Because I'm going right to the top.  Right to the high level.  This opens you up to her world, though.  Right.  Of high level gorgeous bitches, man.  Oh, so you're saying this could be a shoe in the door.  Meaning no matter what happens out of this deal.  I don't have to go back to a...  Never have to see another suicide girl ever again. 
[02:47:00]  I don't have to go back to...  There'll be local, like, public access news girls ready to give you some pussy.  Those will be the new...  Those will be the new air conditioner repair girls.  Right, right.  You know what I'm saying to you?  Okay.  So, they look up to Jill.  Jill's big time.  She's fine in the morning, you know.  She's opening you up.  Because all her group...  Because, first of all, she's dealing with...  You're with this fucking radio shock guy. 
[02:47:30]  Oh, my God.  He's so...  His dick is fucking gigantic.  He's fucking...  Oh, my God.  He's so this.  He's so that.  And they're like, now they're going, hmm.  Here's what you don't do.  Don't go to any of her parties where she's showing you off.  Not you.  Dress exactly how you dress in your fucking construction clothes.  Like, come back near him.  And you come with a fucking...  With a bottle of half-drinking Gatorade.  And you're like, hey, hey, toots.  And you slap her friends on the ass.  And she goes... 
[02:48:00]  Like they're showing off Morgan Freeman from that pimp movie.  You ever see?  You ever see the pimp movie?  No.  A street smile.  Oh, shit.  And the girl brings her to a party.  And he's just like pimping all the old white women.  Like, what's up, bitch?  And you just go there and you be Anthony.  And all her little fucking goofy friends, they're going to want a piece.  You're the man now, dude.  Look at how Patrice fucking educates.  That's why he's got to write the book.  I know.  Look how easy that is.  And an object to her, too.  Don't forget.  Mm-hmm.  Seriously.  This is a beautiful thing, man.  I'm fucking so proud of you. 
[02:48:30]  I'm digging this, Patrice.  Absolutely.  We got a seminar I'm getting.  I like it.  We got to take a break.  We got to find the audio of Patrice telling Anthony a while ago to go after Jill Nicolini.  And Anthony didn't listen.  I don't remember telling him on air.  I remember telling you off air.  We thought it might have been on air, too.  No, I think on air you said something about it.  And then you turned around and pointed at the TV and go, there you go.  That's the girl you see.  Because I had just went down to the station.  Yeah.  And I had talked to like 10 of them.  Yeah.  None of them have men.  None of them.  And I'm talking my bullshit and they're just listening.  And I didn't get to Jill at all. 
[02:49:00]  But it was all them other girls down there.  Imagine if she had something to confess.  Like you see his death jam.  And she's like, I slept with that guy.  Holy shit.  I'm just, she, she's, she's, they all don't have men and they don't understand why.  That's all I'm saying.  They don't, they don't get why they don't have men.  And, and why is that, Patrice?  Because, because of the syndrome, the low self-esteem syndrome.  Men don't want to talk. 
[02:49:30]  First of all, real quick, men talk to women that's lower than them so they can have the proper confidence.  So really what guys want to do is walk up to a woman, any woman and go,  God damn, I just want to eat your pussy.  That's what we want to do.  But we, we pretend like girls like Jill Nicolini, every guy that's ever been with them pretends to love them right away.  I love you so much, Jill.  I love you so much now.  Just fuck them.  So they never hear the honesty, which is I want to fuck you and then build from there like fat girls or ugly girls would hear the truth. 
[02:50:00]  That's why fat girls, ugly girls always have boyfriends.  Beautiful, high level women don't.  But that's why I love to fuck with lawyers and doctors because no one says, look, you dirty tramp.  Wait, is it because, is it that fat girls take that because they kind of have to?  No.  Like, no, fucks no.  Men, fat girls, guys, they get enough dick.  They get as much dick as any beautiful woman.  Trust me.  They just, they, what happens is the fat girls, they, they get the actual manness.  Jill has never known what it's like to get a dude that just goes, what? 
[02:50:30]  Let me tell you something real quick.  No, go ahead.  It's fine.  If you look at a picture, right?  And this is what I mean by stay better than them.  If you look at a picture of Oprah and Stedman, Oprah always looks like she's in a picture with Stedman.  She's always curled up no matter what her fucking billions are and all that shit.  Stedman don't give a shit.  He's just like, you're my bitch.  And she's always looking like, he's like, Stedman, I love you. 
[02:51:00]  Look at pictures of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt.  It always looks like he's in a picture with her.  She's in the front.  He's carrying some fucking African babies.  No respect.  He's lost his fucking thing that makes him better than Angelina.  Look at you.  There's a picture right there.  Look at her.  Look at her.  She owns islands.  And she's like.  He's just sitting there like, yeah.  If you go to Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, it's always him in the back looking like he's flustered because she's being Hollywood and he's become Mr. Jolie. 
[02:51:30]  Trust me, man.  Mr. Jolie.  Make sure she.  And when you marry her, she is Jill Cumia.  She ain't get no slash or nothing.  No Nicolini Cumia.  Fuck that.  Already got us hitched.  Thanks, Patrice.  Try that one.  I can see.  We're looking at this picture.  Yeah, look.  Look at that shit.  Look, she's carrying her coffee and there's Brad Pitt.  And he's pushing a stroller with a Benetton ad.  No, no, no. 
[02:52:00]  So.  God, your observations are ridiculously good.  I'm just very proud.  I just don't want you to lose it.  All right.  Nah.  I'm proud of you.  We got to take a break.  Well, the Oprah picture should be called One Beard Sits Next to Another Beard.  Let's be honest.  Yeah, what's going on there?  She's curled up with Stedman and you can almost hear her going, I never eat pussy.  We got a big audience because they're in town for the animation festival.  Animationfest.net.  That's where all the animation is going to be later tonight for everyone that can't go  to the show tonight.  Coke Logic sitting at the big boys table. 
[02:52:30]  Very cool.  Coke Logic, man.  God damn.  And we got five hour energy.  Maybe Iraq could bring in the five hour energy for everybody.  Who needs a little.  He's too tired.  Who needs a little pep.  Oh, a lot of hands going on.  Everybody said yes.  Thanks to five hour energy for the free product.  They're hooking the show up with some energy drinks for the passing crew.  That's five hour energy.  Wakes up your brain and gets you a bright, alerted focus without the jitters or the crash  later in the day.  Iraq, come on in with the five hour energy. 
[02:53:00]  Come on in.  Oh, God.  What's he doing?  Well, we got Butcher.  He's a real showstopper.  No kidding, man.  Butcher.  Oh, and.  Oh, Cream Pie Jones.  Cream Pie Jones.  Uh, Cream, Cream Pie, come to the head of the class here.  And it's Cream Pie Jones.  This is Cream Pie Jones.  Very good, Danny.  This is Cream Pie Jones.  Turn around.  This is, uh, the star of the shit hat videos.  If you remember, yeah, when we decided we needed to play with shit for a month or two. 
[02:53:30]  What the fuck phase was that we went through?  Yeah, dig your hand in the toilet and pull Jimmy's shit out.  Now put it on your head.  Look, it's a hat.  It was chilly and the boy needed some head hair.  Pablo Picasso had his blue phase.  We had our shit phase.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So far it's on eight years.  All right, a quick break and we'll continue.  The O.P. and Anthony Show presents Sex Advice with Jim Norton.  Build up that immunity.  Keep fucking them without bags. 
[02:54:00]  You want to be a fucking man or you want to live in a dress the rest of your life?  How's your body ever supposed to learn what age looks like and reject it if it doesn't see it?  Stick it in her ass without a condom and then laugh about it later.  Coke Logic, this is for you because we love you.  Oh, Jesus.  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  A little blues traveler being played.  There's nothing wrong with looking like Papa, man.  And Papa's small now, too.  He's really small, so you look like old school Papa. 
[02:54:30]  Show the other one, Dan.  Show the gang the other one.  There's one.  It's scary.  You could be like...  Have you heard that before?  I don't know.  We lost it.  It's all right.  Yeah, I believe it.  Yeah, whatever.  We got Coke.  Oh, there it is.  Tell me he doesn't look just like this version of turn around Coke Logic.  Humor us for a second.  Wow.  How close is that?  It looks like Papa, man.  Wow.  Oh, wait.  You got to get up on the screen up there?  All right, hold on.  Give me a second.  I'll save this so I can zoom in on it. 
[02:55:00]  All right, hold on.  We'll do a visual.  Can I say one more thing about Anthony on this situation?  You're so obsessed.  He is obsessed.  Why are you obsessed with Antelini?  I'm not moving on to Pal Talk.  Angelini.  What's it called?  Antelini.  Antelini.  Antelini.  I am obsessed with that, but I'm moving on to Pal Talk.  You're going to have to...  You're the leader of Pal Talk.  This is going to be trouble.  So you have to anoint a new person to take over all these scattering brains of no leader. 
[02:55:30]  Our leader left us kind of thing.  Yeah?  So I have to anoint a new leader.  Just a new person to keep all the...  Because obviously I haven't been on as much as I used to.  Do you realize?  Because they get emotional.  You know, sometimes I bump into some of these whack bags and they get very emotional.  And they can take it personal.  Like, fuck Anthony.  He just left us alone.  And you don't want these crazy people to have no direction. 
[02:56:00]  And you were the...  Like, Opie completely has distanced himself from these people.  Yes, yes.  Yeah.  But you have a...  You had your hand on it.  You know what I mean?  So you've got to have somebody on these sites, man.  What?  Hey.  That's a damn good distinction.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Holy shit.  You've got to have somebody, you know, just to keep everybody happy, man.  Somebody close to you that's on Pal Talk.  Who do you think would be a good candidate? 
[02:56:30]  Someone around here?  E-Rock?  I don't know.  Does he go on there?  E-Rock's always on there anyway.  And he's the worst.  E-Rock is a sneaky fuck.  Oh, God.  He's a sleazebag motherfucker.  Remember the Russian bra that came in?  And she goes, oh, E-Rock just emailed me and told me to come by and check out the show.  Yeah.  Out of nowhere, he's just emailing girls that are in radio.  Yeah.  Come down.  I go, oh, why'd you email her?  With really nice tits.  Oh, because she's in radio.  And I thought, you know, she would want to come down and, you know, see the show. 
[02:57:00]  Oh, do you do that to every guy, too?  Do you look at their profile?  See if radio comes up in the search and invite men down?  And he goes, yes.  Yeah.  Bullshit.  Yeah, whatever.  Bullshit.  You know, Mr. Nice Guy.  Shut up.  And I know all these motherfuckers.  I don't care.  It's people I like or don't like.  They're all yapping with each other.  They all yap with each other on this fucking thing.  Yeah.  So, E-Rock, there's no secrets.  I've never heard you so disgusting when you, that sound when you talk about pal talk.  I just know they're yapping. 
[02:57:30]  You never said the word yapping before?  They're all, it bit bit bit, one tells another and the other one tells the other one.  Now it's some catty bullshit.  A lot of catty bullshit.  Drama.  It's all drama.  This motherfucker said fuck pal talk.  It's all fucking drama.  Fuck them stupid motherfuckers.  All you motherfuckers, go fuck yourself.  That's right.  I'm going to visit my constituents at the news.  Where's Katie Couric?  That bitch ain't paying me since two days. 
[02:58:00]  God damn, nigga.  You really are a gambler.  You went from zero to 60.  Don't leave them hanging, dude.  They're fucking stuck.  Well, E-Rock can't be it.  I hear things.  They yap.  I heard somebody might have been called a looker by E-Rock.  Oh, a looker.  Hey, you're a looker.  What does that mean?  It's like hubba hubba.  It's 23 skidoo.  A looker?  I'll bet fucking fat neck put LOL after it. 
[02:58:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  LOL, like just joking.  So he's not to be trusted with the pal talk empire.  Who do you say was a looker?  I want to know.  Oh, I don't know.  I just heard it in passing.  I'm not going to yap.  Saying someone's a looker is not a tattletale.  You know what's going to happen?  It's going to be like fucking Gladiator.  I'm going to be out of the picture.  I want it to anoint like fucking Maximus as the next Caesar to take care of it.  And then everything will fuck up and E-Rock will be in charge. 
[02:59:00]  It'll just be pandemonium.  You know, you can't just leave it naked like that.  You are gone.  Let's just face it.  You've moved on.  I can't think of anyone on staff.  I can't think of anyone on staff.  Maybe.  Danny can't.  Danny's so fucking thrown into the drama of that bullshit too.  He's too busy.  Danny.  Danny's too nasty.  You're just too fucking nasty.  I'll just call them all cunts.  Keep things going.  You'll be alone in a room.  Just bouncing. 
[02:59:30]  Everyone that pops in the second they pop in.  Bounce.  I was in fucking Pal Talk for a long time.  I loved it.  But then I got my Mac and you couldn't really look at it.  But it was better too.  Let's be honest.  Yeah.  Stop with it.  You couldn't do it.  You graduated from Pal Talk.  No, I personally didn't have my Mac.  And a girl sucked my penis one time on camera.  Not for the whole listeners, but for another girl.  Really?  Yeah, it was fucking hot.  Because this girl, and she knows who she is.  She's very sexy.  She used to kind of like to choke on a cock.  Oh.  You know, who am I to say no?  I mean, you know, am I rude? 
[03:00:00]  Would she know who she is?  A compliment?  Like, yeah, that dirty bitch, she knows who she is.  She was sexy, man.  Yeah, she was a sexy girl.  I believe me.  She wanted to be slapped and choked with a dick and fucking...  God bless her.  Yeah.  I'm like, I want you to suck it on camera.  And she's like, all right.  I just don't want you to just leave them all fucked up, man.  That's all.  Yeah.  Yeah, we'll figure it out.  I'll have to do something.  Yeah, don't come on.  Hey, Steven S. from Bayshore writes...  Wait a minute.  Yeah, go ahead.  You all.  No, you can't.  Good luck to him.  Just treat him like a mother turtle, a mother sea turtle. 
[03:00:30]  Just leave him right on the beach.  There you go.  Wow, Anthony's really in love.  Why?  Because this is not Anthony.  It is Anthony.  Nah.  It's just Anthony better.  When Anthony's done, he's done.  He's done with Pout Dog.  Are you done with the gambling, my friend?  No.  No.  What are you kidding?  Unless Jill doesn't like it.  She likes a good casino every so often.  She likes gambling, too?  Okay.  Let's go.  We're rocking.  High class low life.  This is perfect. 
[03:01:00]  Perfect.  It's perfect.  Dude, you done struck goddamn gold, man.  Hell yeah.  Hell yeah, man.  We're from the same trashy, you know, Long Island shit, you know?  Steven S. from Bayshore writes, stop picking on Coke Traveler.  We got the picture up there.  You guys saw the picture?  Yeah.  That's a good one.  Dude, I mean, no offense.  You look just like Poppin', man.  Let's be honest.  And you should run with it, dude.  Run with it.  Yes, look.  He took his glasses off, so he looks even more like him. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah, run with that shit, dude.  Exactly.  It would probably be a little bit better if I didn't get that every night at the bar.  I'd be like, three in the morning, be like, hey, blues traveler.  But do girls do it?  No.  Girls don't talk to me.  Girls don't talk to you?  Girls go, blues traveler.  Bye.  I don't like him either.  Good day.  We got to get Coke Logic as girl.  Yeah.  I agree.  No girlfriend?  No girlfriend.  You're a fucking superstar on this program, dude. 
[03:02:00]  Superstar, artistic.  Yeah, you're right up there with Steven S. from Bayshore and me and him get together.  Maybe.  Hey, dude, he's super creative.  Maybe he can fucking run his.  He can take over.  But you just give him some advice.  Give it to Coke Logic.  Give it to Coke Logic.  How does he use his creativity and his smarts to get a woman?  To go somewhere where those girls are.  You have to be where they are.  No one gives a fuck in the street.  Hey, you know, I'm very creative.  Have you seen my cartoons?  You creepy motherfucker. 
[03:02:30]  Has there ever been any girls who go, oh my God, you're so talented.  Women are, they're not like us.  Don't, never forget that Coke.  They, they're not, I know that if you was a woman, you would never fuck you.  And I say that for me either.  Like if I was a girl, I wouldn't, if I was my woman, I wouldn't fuck me.  Because I'm me.  But she does.  Women are fucking like that.  So you'll find somebody, as soon as the one girl goes, you're so talented.  That's what she's into.  You draw her face. 
[03:03:00]  Make her cartoon out of her and go, I hope you don't think, always go, hey, preface it.  I don't want you to think I'm creepy or anything.  Because she, you know, I just thought she gets beheaded at the end of it.  You draw her face, then you draw your dick coming on it.  And then my ending.  Use what you got, big man.  That's your, that's your supreme talent, man.  Because guys all go over your shit.  So that means girls are definitely going to go, oh my God.  Because dudes go, dude, this fucking guy's amazing. 
[03:03:30]  Girls are going to do that.  So you have to find out what girls are doing.  Dude, how fucking great would that be?  If you met a girl, got close enough where you could make a cartoon of her, make her body  look a little better than it really does and shit like that.  And then just make a real funny thing that she watched and just went, oh my God, that  is the sweetest, coolest thing.  She'll be into you, trust me.  Oh, yeah.  Yes, man.  The girl, there's, you're nodding, though.  We're not going to, we're not going to pick on you.  Don't worry.  Jesus Christ, calm down.  Holy shit.  It could work, right? 
[03:04:00]  And never forget, as she's talking, right, in some weird, it's going to be a weird rejection.  Don't worry about it.  You establish yourself.  You know, her, her vagina is the only thing keeping her at the level of you mentally.  You're better than she is.  Never forget it.  And she's kind of rejecting you.  And then think of what, and ask her what she does.  What's your talent?  I don't know.  I don't, I don't know. 
[03:04:30]  She has a vagina.  That's her thing.  That's the great equalizer.  Conquer that mentally, dude.  Conquer that.  And you'll understand that, dude, I'm Coke Logic on the ONA show.  You understand what I'm saying?  That means something somewhere.  That's a good opening line.  That's for sure.  Before she starts her spiel.  Because she's thinking about what I fuck him automatically.  That's what women do.  You understand what I'm saying?  So her rejection is...  Fucking Patrice, man.  You agree with some of that?  Go ahead, ma'am. 
[03:05:00]  What's your deal?  What's my deal?  Yes.  What do you do for a living?  I work for a toy company.  Of course.  That's the same thing the guy from Family Guy does.  Peter Griffin works for a fucking toy company.  What else, beautiful?  Do you have a man?  Yes, I do.  Where's he at?  At work. 
[03:05:30]  What does he do?  He works for a trucking company.  Just whatever, right?  Is he tremendously handsome?  Yeah, he's okay.  Yeah, whatever.  Let me ask you, how was your date when you went on it with Billy Bob Thornton and Sling Blade?  Holy shit!  Oh, god damn!  Oh, fuck!  Oh, fuck! 
[03:06:00]  Oh, poor man!  Let me get ready to cry!  Go ahead, look at it!  Look at it, Coke Logic!  Let the tears flow, baby!  It's all sickness coming up.  Oh, fucking A!  Oh, shit!  Oh, was that wrong?  Shit!  Woo!  That was not right.  This fucking guy's a goddamn crazy recluse.  For him to make all his shit, man, he's getting great.  Yeah, yeah, you gotta be.  We gotta get you out the house, man, before fucking Kevin Spacey kills you. 
[03:06:30]  Hey, Patrice.  Damien from Ohio writes, oh my god, a self-help book from Patrice would sell like crazy.  New title, You're Better Than Her by Patrice O'Neal.  You're Better Than Her.  That is a good title.  That's a principle, man.  You have to think that way, and they have to think it, too.  Just use your talent, because you gotta practice to be able to play.  So your talent, you have to keep doing it, but get out the fucking house, dude.  Get out the fucking house, man. 
[03:07:00]  Get yourself a bitch.  Hey, that means he's not gonna do the animation thing.  Oh, we're totally ruining it.  I don't want to fuck up your thing, but I'm saying, I know a lot of what he does is just recluse.  I'm just gonna send in a fucking three-second stick figure fucking animation as he's fucking  everything that moves.  At least pump this fucker up now to be cult logic.  At least to get this motherfucker some pussy.  At least.  He's gonna mail in a loose leaf book and go,  Yeah, where you flip the page.  There's your fucking animation. 
[03:07:30]  I'm face deep in pussy.  I'm sorry, you know I'm looking to help a motherfucker out  We want to keep this guy in his basement  You're insecure probably about being a big dude  But John Candy was a fucking big dude  And funny and respected  You tell me women didn't want to fuck him  They want to fuck who you are  That's where they're different than us  They'll fuck who you are as opposed to what you look like 
[03:08:00]  That's the same thing all of us deal with  See actually I think that's a little wrong  I'm actually not so insecure  It's just the  Roll the dice  You know, it's just  Why are you rolling me?  That's not going to get you girls  I got insecure listening to him say that  I start to feel like that about myself 
[03:08:30]  I'm like, aw, Patrice  No, you walk into a bar and there's a handful of women  They own it  And for that night, you have your options  And if they're not interested in you  That's one night off, you know  And just  Not very lucky  So you think that's the luck of the draw thing  Instead of a, you know, play 
[03:09:00]  Play your hand kind of a thing  Yeah, because I have no game  Oh, see  That's just that  Yeah  Give him a little something  I don't have pick-up lines  I'm a  No, pick-up lines suck  Yeah, I don't know  What it is  No, it's fucking attitude with Patrice  I've seen it  It's fucking mystic  You can't even  That's right  Because on the sidewalk after the show  He does it every time  Oh my god  He flirts with every girl that goes by  And any of us use the same lines  We'll get smacked in the fucking face  But they just go with it 
[03:09:30]  It's just belief  And I have to say  Because my girl always listens  I tell her this about me  And I have to flirt  Because that's how I'm sexy  I'm not sexy like her  Like, she's sexy like guys want to fuck her  She just walks down the street  She's sexy  And I have to deal with that  A lot of times  Because I've been with her so long  That I forget how sexy she is  So I'll walk 20 paces behind  Just to see guys want to fuck her  So I can go  All right, I mean  I keep forgetting  I forget  I see this bitch nude  And walking around  And her  Not the sexiest thing  But dudes in the street  Want to fall over 
[03:10:00]  So I tell her  Look, that's not me  I got to talk to bitches every day  So you can feel  That there are some women  Attractive to me  That's the equivalent of her  Looking hot  Yes  Is you  You know  Playing  Your game  I have to  Because then  The energy of women  Thinking I'm attractive  She has to smell it on me  You know what I'm saying  So what you have to do  Is be psychotically  Confident  But not arrogant  You just have to be psychotic  Like  There's no fucking way  This guy thinks he can fuck me  You understand what I'm saying 
[03:10:30]  There's no way  And you go  Yes there is  You have to give that off  But I can't tell you  How to give it off  But  How you feel the most confident  Is when you're doing  Like  You see how you handed  Opie that thing  And said play it  And you just had the confidence  That it was going to be good  You have a pride  An ethic  In your shit  You got to have the same  Ethic in your confidence  Somehow  And use your cartoons  Motherfucker  Tonight  That's right  Tonight  You are coke logic  When they see you  Oh my god  That's coke  There's going to be  Some bitch in there

[03:13:00]  We've got a problem  I'm trying to get down  And all of a sudden  The next thing you see  Like four bodies in the street  With white sheets  And the credits start rolling  All in 8 Pictures  Proudly presents  Sex and the City  The Everyone Dies Version  Watch and laugh your ass off  As the four main characters  Get hit by a truck  And get spread like mulch  All over the streets  Of New York City  Coming to a theater near you  I like that one 
[03:13:30]  Thumbs up  Down  What do you got there?  That's good  Pretty good  We got like a focus group  In front of us today  You liked it  Except for the mulch line  At the end right?  You thought that was  Unnecessary overkill  Right  The mulch line  Was a little  Yeah  See perfect  After  When they all get killed  It was a big laugh  But he had to just keep going  And they get  Leg mulch  Yes  Like the filthy  Castrating pigs they are  Couldn't help but be Steve  Is Roland still here?

[03:14:00]  He's got a laugh  In front of everybody  You guys got to  You guys got to see  What we see  I mean  The noise he makes is amazing  But you got to see  How his whole body collapses  But it's very natural for him  It really is  Roland  And remember  Sitcom  Sitcom entrance  Entrance everyone  Yeah  Roland everybody  He rolls his eyes  Did somebody  Did somebody say my name  And then he rolls his eyes 
[03:14:30]  Like this is such bullshit  Sitcom entrance  Like Schneider  Do we got a microphone for Roland?

Put my balls through slats?  No  I just as a goof  Never  And if they're shrunk  Why would they then  Why would they get caught  In the slats then?

[03:22:30]  Quarters that I have to put in  While my bathroom door closes  It's the early morning music  Yeah  Anthony's not missing  Shower time  He's setting his alarm  For shower time  It's the early morning music  Yeah  Because honestly  You usually get up at what  4.30  Oh my god  Sometimes it's like  4.35  And that's when I get in  A little late  But now you're getting up  At what time?  I wake up at  3 in the morning  3  3  5.30  All the same  Whatever  It's to say  It's the morning 
[03:23:00]  I wake up in the morning  Good morning  Yeah  Wait, wait  We're going to do this properly  Is this it?  Alright, here it is  What is it?  It's 3 o'clock?

[03:24:00]  Finish up with the fans  And Coke Logic  Do wine of the day  Drink some more  Five hour energy  And Danny got very mad  At Elok, by the way  Why?  I don't know  He just got very mad  He's like  Are you paying attention  At all  Sitcom entrance  We've got to give you a line first  You have to know when to come in  Yeah, that's true  Yeah, really  It's all about the line  You're right, Jimmy  God damn it  I was here ten minutes ago  Where did my four cases of alcohol go? 
[03:24:30]  Hey, Danny  He did kind of a Kramer  He did  He did a Kramer entrance  You have to  You've got to be wacky about it  We should have the whole staff  Do their entrance  See who has the best one  I don't think anyone's going to beat Danny  Danny's is pretty good  I should have just stumbled in  And then vomited on my shoes  Again  Why'd you get mad at Sweet Potato?  Well  Sweet Potato  Eric's on the board  In there  And he kind of has to  Pay attention to what's going on  So that he could 
[03:25:00]  Have appropriate  Drops for the show  So, I mean  If there's a secondary problem going on  While that's equally as important  He still has to be focused  On what he's doing  What was the secondary problem?  We may have a phone issue  It doesn't look like it  I just think there was just  No calls coming at the time  But it looked like  There could potentially be a problem  Tell everyone we have no listeners  Or you're slamming  Or maybe they was  And now they're back  That's the thing  Alright, thank you  But Patrice  Patrice was commenting  On that early morning  You know  Do, do, do, do, do, do  Music  And that was a perfect  It was a perfect opportunity 
[03:25:30]  For Eric to have that poll  Ready to go  Uh-huh  And because he was too busy  Doing something else  Not paying attention  You know  Yeah, I was wondering  Why it was taking so long  It kind of, you know  Spoiled everything  Yeah  Almost ruined the whole bit  Because, you know  Everything's timing  So it takes time  For me to go in there  And be like  Come on, Eric  Let's, you know  And then 25 seconds later  It's not going to have  That impact  That it could have had  Up front  That's a good point  How many people  Riding on the bus  You just threw Eric on  That bus has been  At maximum occupancy  For quite some time  Exactly
