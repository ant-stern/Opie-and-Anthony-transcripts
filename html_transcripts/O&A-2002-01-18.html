<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts' characteristically crude humor and sexually suggestive banter. Opie's severe gastrointestinal distress, suspected to be food poisoning from a ham and Swiss cheese bagel from a specific deli, became a major recurring theme.  Numerous callers reported similar experiences with the same deli, while a nurse caller suggested a viral infection as an alternative diagnosis.  Opie unleashed several angry tirades ("FU") at Mayor Bloomberg over FDR Drive traffic delays and at the deli.  Technical difficulties, attributed to a broken keyboard and "Stinky" the technician, further fueled the chaotic atmosphere.

The show then transitioned to the "Naughty Nighty" contest, with a promo for the Cleveland station's participation. Three women who came to the studio to participate in the contest were interviewed.  The conversation quickly became sexually charged, focusing on the women's physical attributes.  One guest's mention of having syphilis led to further crude remarks. The segment included discussions about websites related to feces, a malfunctioning Celsius thermometer, and continued sexually explicit conversations with the guests and callers.

Next, three female guests promoting a website (with a confusingly spelled address criticized by Opie) appeared.  Initial dissatisfaction with a lack of immediate physical interaction quickly escalated into sexually suggestive acts involving the guests, Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton; including nudity, simulated sex acts, and sex toys. The guests performed raunchy splits, and Norton engaged in physical interactions with them.  Negative listener feedback, highlighting the guests' annoyance and the segment's unentertainment, was addressed throughout.  The Iron Sheik's airport terrorism scare in Rochester was briefly mentioned.  The segment ended with a chaotic, sexually explicit scene on a couch, further listener feedback, and discussion of a miscommunication regarding the guests' understanding of their roles.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to a chaotic situation involving Joe, who falsely claimed affiliation with the show to promote a "Luscious Lipstick Lesbians" contest with a $100,000 prize.  Amy and Davida, two women who believed they were participating in a legitimate show contest, and Amy's husband Rick, confronted Joe and the hosts regarding the deception.  The ensuing discussion involved heated exchanges, angry phone calls from multiple people, including Rich Voss, and the revelation of Joe's misleading emails. Amy and Davida, alongside other women from a VIP club, were in the studio, contributing to the already volatile atmosphere with insults and name-calling.  The hosts briefly considered removing Joe from the studio. The conversation devolved into discussions of personal lives and relationships, punctuated by further insults and vulgar language.

The final segment featured a highly offensive exchange between the hosts, two female guests ("Lady Di" and "Marion"), and numerous callers.  The guests were subjected to considerable verbal abuse and insults regarding their weight and appearance.  The conversation included crude sexual references, homophobic slurs, and derogatory comments about various groups.  Adam Farrar, promoting his show *The Job*, was present.  Listener calls, often equally insulting and vulgar, were frequent.  The “stinky cam” was mentioned again, along with a recurring discussion about the number of "N's" in "Canada."  A caller ("Frenchy") engaged in a particularly aggressive argument with Lady Di and Marion.  The segment ended with promotions for the show, the guests' websites, upcoming appearances, and the "naughty nightys" contest.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Let's, uh, let's, uh, take a break.  No, no, no, no, no, take a break.  No break, no break.  A little warm-up bit there.  It's Friday!  Friday!  Friday!  Hey, everybody!  We're all going to get laid! 
[00:00:30]  I need to go pooping!  Oh, you're sticking in my mouth.  Oh, what a bitch!  Huh?  Cancel your appointment!  Shut your nose.  Ouch.  I'm over here now!  Puggaloo-puggaloo-puggaloo-puggaloo-puggaloo-puggaloo-puggaloo-puggaloo-puggaloo.  I'm over here now!  Hey! 
[00:01:00]  Who's the stripper?  Marijuana is the bomb.  Pick your balls and kick it off your ass!  Friggin' fag!  You want to make out or something?  Wow!  You're a girl!  Liar!  Tell us what you know, you goddamn liar!  How are you? 
[00:01:30]  Now we're having fun.  We cry!  And welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else.  866-2774. 
[00:02:00]  Wow!  Yes!  What's the matter with our phone screen?  It's all messed up.  It's all messed up.  It's now safe to turn off your computer.  Is that the technical jargon Pete Johnson's using?  It's all messed up.  What's wrong with it, Pete?  It's all messed up.  I'll fix it after we have our tea and crumpets out on the furniture.  The Ikea furniture.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I saw them they were having their tea and crumpets.  Well, I guess the phones aren't important for this type of radio show. 
[00:02:30]  Nah.  Nah.  That's okay.  We don't need phones.  It's not like we talk or anything.  It's not like we take many calls.  If we were a rock block station, who cares about the phones?  But I think we might need the phones, right?  It doesn't even look like it's being worked on.  No, that's what's scaring me.  I just, like it's sitting there.  The computer is ready to be shut down.  That's it.  Well, Stinky would know best.  What does Stinky know best?  What does Stinky know about the phones?  Major surgery going on.  Major surgery today? 
[00:03:00]  They've called in Scott Columbo for this one.  Oh.  What's up, Stink?  What seems to have happened?  The keyboard busted.  That's it.  None of the buttons worked.  So.  Escape was F9 and all the buttons.  To get a new keyboard is a big thing.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Don't call us then.  Because we can't answer your phone.  Yeah, perish that thought.  I didn't know you needed a keyboard to answer a phone.  I learned something today.  Who knew?  Around here you do. 
[00:03:30]  We're talking computer keyboard.  Oh, there it is.  Okay.  Now we're getting, look, it's starting back up now.  All right.  System configurations.  That's always good, right?  Starting Windows 95.  Woo.  Windows 95.  Windows 95.  Why are we still using that?  I guess it's the best format for that system.  And now it went blank.  It's an operating system.  All right.  Well, they're working on it, Anthony.  Are you using CompuServe, too?  I have an F here to start off.  I was going to ask you. 
[00:04:00]  I was going to ask you if you...  Oh, my God.  ...if you calmed down yet.  No.  My first FU goes out to Mayor Bloomberg here in New York.  The New York City mayor?  The new mayor.  What did he say to you?  Mayor Dickbag Ass F.  Some people might call up and say that the mayor isn't responsible for this problem and stuff.  I'm from the school of he's the head muckety-muck here in New York City. 
[00:04:30]  So if something happens, it's his fault.  It's under his jurisdiction.  And I cannot for the life of me understand why on a Friday, during the day, you would repair potholes on one of the only north-south thoroughfares in Manhattan.  Those of you that are not here in New York City, you know what Manhattan Island looks like.  Everybody knows Manhattan. 
[00:05:00]  There's a highway on the east side and a highway on the west side.  And that is it.  And that's it.  All the streets in the middle are always effed up.  If you're on the east side, you take the FDR drive.  There's no lights.  It's a highway.  If you're on the west side, you take the west side highway.  Can't take the west side highway.  Some animals decided to dump a couple of buildings on it.  So if you're in lower Manhattan, you cannot take the west side highway up to northern Manhattan or Midtown because of the terrorism.  The FDR, on the other hand, you whiz right up there. 
[00:05:30]  Unless they're fixing potholes.  Fixing potholes today on the entire length of the FDR.  I left at 11 o'clock this morning.  From Brooklyn.  From Brooklyn for a meeting today at noon here at the station.  I got in a little after one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Isn't that great?  You know how far I am from the station?  I'm 16 miles from the station. 
[00:06:00]  It is 16 miles.  Do the math.  Is that 8 miles an hour?  I averaged 8 miles an hour the whole way.  You can't walk.  There is no reason to do this.  And I'll tell you why they're doing it.  Because I was listening to the news stations.  The road crews out there in force today effing up traffic.  Preparation for the storm.  The storm that's coming up, Buffalo.  Buffalo, we're getting a storm here too.  We're going to be just like you. 
[00:06:30]  The storm?  We're getting, I think they said, maybe 3 inches.  Won't the snow just kind of fill up the potholes?  Yeah.  Can we worry about the potholes a little later on?  They decided they were going to fix the potholes now.  Because everyone in New York is in a panic right now.  Because the news station said the word, snow.  Mark my words, it doesn't snow.  You're going to get the same goofball ass wipe going, going, hey, we sure got lucky that time.  That storm skirted us here. 
[00:07:00]  Let me show you where it went offshore and did nothing.  They say 3 to 6 inches in our area.  And then they got to add this in.  And up to 10 inches elsewhere in the area.  Like the Rocky Mountains.  Where is elsewhere?  The area of the planet Earth.  Have you been to elsewhere?  No, I've never been to elsewhere.  They're so full of crap, they love hyping stuff.  And the weather is their biggest hype.  And they get these morons that buy it. 
[00:07:30]  We're going to get a little sprinkle of snow.  Relax.  You don't have to fill up the potholes so people can't drive in the city.  That's already effed up.  That's my FU.  Mayor Bloomberg, suck it!  I hate that guy.  I have an FU to the bagel place.  They gave me a bad sandwich yesterday.  No, I got to argue this FU if you're going to have an FU for the place downstairs.  But I'm too weak to argue because I've been, well, I've been pooping for the last 15 straight hours. 
[00:08:00]  You are saying you have FU poisoning.  Not even poop.  What is it?  Pudding?  Butterscotch pudding?  Nope.  Just flat out water.  Salad shooter?  Water.  I am so dehydrated right now.  It's so weak.  Does it look like a house salad with a lot of vinaigrette?  You don't want to know what it looks like.  You see that coffee you're drinking, my friend?  There you go.  That's it.  That is it.  That's nice.  That's the texture.  Now, you said you had 15 hours.  Every half hour, running to the bathroom. 
[00:08:30]  What did you have that gave you food poisoning?  I had a...  Give me the exact sandwich.  You know what?  All right.  It's either the sandwich or the fine folks from Washington that came up for that meeting yesterday poisoned me.  Oh, that's...  Well, that's a possibility.  I'll go with that.  I had a ham sandwich with a little Swiss cheese.  Yeah.  On a bagel with mustard.  Bagel with mustard.  Oh, just thinking about it.  I have the same...  But that's why I know it's the sandwich.  Why?  Because just thinking about it is making me nauseous. 
[00:09:00]  You went out to dinner last night.  How do you know it wasn't that?  No, because I was having problems way before then.  I was having problems at the end of the show yesterday, my friend.  Yeah, but food poisoning takes like 24 hours to start.  Before it kicks in?  Yeah.  I need a doctor on the phone.  I had the same sandwich.  I started eating that in the same place.  I started eating that sandwich yesterday and I knew something was wrong.  Like the cheese was melted, but it wasn't melted in a good way.  It was melted because it's just been out too long.  Where the cheese started turning clear. 
[00:09:30]  I think you just have a good old-fashioned tummy ache.  Shut up.  You have a little belly ache?  Yeah.  I can't even fight today.  Rub his tummy, Norton.  Give his belly and his hair a little tussle.  Rub his tummy.  A little soup.  I finally had some spaghetti.  Just plain spaghetti.  Just to get something in my stomach.  Wait till that comes out.  Yeah.  Don't look like a snake hand game.  Ah!  But I'm not pooping anymore, finally.  Thank God.  I think it's all out of me.  Can't poop more than that. 
[00:10:00]  15 straight hours?  Can you?  No.  I had to sit through eating lunch in three seconds because of the meetings we had today.  And listen to Opie go to grab the bathroom.  He can go, I got a, what did you say?  Uh, that's spray mud.  I got a spray mud.  I'm like, gee.  Thanks.  Yeah.  Thank you here.  It's bad enough.  I got to just wolf this sandwich down.  Yeah.  Now you got to do it with an erection. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  That's bad enough.  Hey, Big Kev, what's up?  I am calling to support Opie.  I had food poisoning for five and a half days from that damn place.  Now let me tell you something.  Same place.  Let me tell you something.  When they decided to order sandwiches from this place in question, I said, didn't Big Kev  get food poisoning from there?  Yes, he did.  Big time.  I was going with the odds because I had eaten there a lot and never got food poisoning.  I hate that place.  I never want to see another bagel in my life.  I have a large cast iron stomach. 
[00:11:00]  It takes a lot to get me sick from food, and I got violently ill for days and days.  Don't say days because I had...  Opie, I hate to tell you this.  It was days.  That place is dirty, dirty.  To quote the great Jim Norton, the awful.  You know what, dude?  I would never eat there again.  Were you spraying mud there, Big Kev?  No, mud has some kind of solid quality to it, so no.  It was a... 
[00:11:30]  Oh, yeah.  That sound, yeah.  Oh, boy.  And it was coming out of both ends.  Oh, that's great.  Oh, see, I'm lucky.  I wasn't puking.  Thank you.  I have gotten sick from that place.  You just told me the name of the place and where it was.  I'm not kidding.  Yeah.  And I felt nauseous or I had the same...  Thank you.  Thank you.  That place is dirty and disgusting.  I didn't want to be an idiot yet.  No, no, no.  I'm like, all right, give me a sandwich in there.  Because I remember after that happened, I'm like, well, it was only a bagel sandwich that  I ate.  Oh, good.  Don't say bagel.  Eat it.  Eat it, my friend. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  I make a sandwich for you, my friend.  A little Swiss cheese that's sweaty.  You know how it sweats?  That's what I said.  Sweating a little bit there.  It starts turning clear.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  That's bad.  No, don't ever eat there.  I just assumed after my episode that none of you guys would eat there again.  Yeah.  I did.  I brought you up yesterday, Big Kev.  So, all right.  Thank you.  Take care.  Bye.  People wondering if you had the beef and broccoli from the Chinese place.  Green puppies.  Andrew.  What up, guys? 
[00:12:30]  Hey.  Hey, I just wanted to remind everybody to run out and buy their shovels and snow for  the big storm we're going to have.  Oh, you got to get the salt, the shovels, the snow blowers, and get batteries.  Get some milk.  And check the elderly.  Get some bread and milk.  Check out all the news cases outside the Home Depot saying, hey, everybody's buying them.  Everyone, hi, I'm John Montone here in front of the Home Depot where people are buying snow 
[00:13:00]  shovels.  And then they go to the actuality.  Well, I was buying American flags here the other day.  And now I'm back for snow shovels.  Back for snow shovels.  John Montone, 10-10 Wayne.  Rock on, guys.  All right.  Thank you, Andrew.  Got it.  Roof.  Someone's going to explain the pothole situation for you, Anthony.  Oh, good.  Good.  John, you're next to the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  I know why. 
[00:13:30]  Because, A, the city's going broke and they won't pay overtime for work done after that  time, you know?  So they got to do it during working hours.  Oh, that's, well, that's wonderful.  How about then?  Well, then that's why they have budget.  They got to keep down the budget.  It all comes out in the mix because there's a loss of revenue from the late employees and  whatnot.  I mean, it's just.  No, no.  Yeah, it all trickles down, my friend.  No, you have to save money somehow, right? 
[00:14:00]  So you got to do it during working hours so they don't pay overtime.  That pisses me off.  Well, you got to deal with it.  More with less.  I was sitting in a crowd of pissed off people in their cars.  No one should have to wait in two hours of traffic because someone is fixing a pothole.  Fixing potholes.  Do it in a way where they don't have to close the goddamn road.  I was not able to get on the FDR drive.  Well, when you figure that one out, then tell us.  Yeah, well, there's three lanes there.  Work around it.  Do something.  Right. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  Well, he sounds lick of you, John.  Piss me off.  Shut up.  I was giggling because I was here at quarter to twelve and they're like, yeah, and qualities  in traffic.  I'm like, oh, it's going to be great.  Yeah.  I knew you were going to be miserable.  I can't even stomach it.  It was pretty entertaining.  Jerry, what's up?  Hey, this is, uh, I was watching ER last night and found a new, uh,  AIDS word of the day for you.  A new word for AIDS?  High five.  High five.  Oh, my God.  High five.  H-I is high and V is Roman numeral for five. 
[00:15:00]  Ooh.  Yeah, we love you guys, man.  The high five.  Yo, he's got the high five.  We'll add that to the ninja.  The ninja and the bug.  The bug.  What was the other one?  Is the ninja the bug?  The hiv.  The hiv.  The hiv and now the high five.  High five.  Cleveland loves you guys, man.  I've been listening to you guys since you guys started out here.  We love Cleveland.  Thank you, Jerry.  Okay, thanks, man.  God's rock.  All right.  Ratings for Columbus came in, by the way.  Yes.  We stayed the same.  We stayed the same.  Did we? 
[00:15:30]  Not less gooder, not more gooder.  We stayed the same.  Hmm.  There you go.  That's the update.  Same gooder?  Same gooder.  Kelly, what's going on?  Hi, how are you?  Uh, you're a nurse?  Hi.  Yes, I am.  And what do you got?  I'm a school nurse, and no, I'm sorry, but you can't have food poisoning.  Why?  Well, it takes 24 to 48 hours to get food poisoning, but there is a pretty nasty stomach virus going  around.  How long does it take?  Uh, about 24 hours, probably.  You're probably over the worst part of it. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  24-hour virus.  Were your legs aches?  Uh, yeah, actually, they do.  My whole body aches, but now it's down to just my legs aching.  My tummy doesn't feel bad anymore.  I'm not, uh, I'm not spraying the mud anymore.  Do you have to sit there after you're done for the cool-down phase?  Oh, yeah.  I did have a few of those during the night.  The cool-down.  Do you ever have to go into the, uh, bathroom here and actually, uh, soak down some paper  towels in anticipation of the cleanup?  No, I just asked the bearded creep standing there to hand me some. 
[00:16:30]  That's always fun.  The cool-down phase.  I'm done.  I'm completely finished, but I've got to sit here a while.  I'll sit down.  Because if I even, uh, touch that area, it's going to peel off like a comic on Silly  Putty.  Thank you.  And Kelly, we got, uh, and the fever?  What's that about?  Well, fever is your body's normal response to infection, so you wouldn't have a fever  if you had food poisoning.  But if you think you have food poisoning, you should call the Board of Health and have  them check out the restaurant.  Well, that's why I didn't mention the name of the place officially, even though a bunch 
[00:17:00]  of people have figured it out.  Pick a big eagle.  All right, Kelly, thank you.  You're welcome.  Bye.  I told you, that was that little bug that I caught when I was out there, but, uh, the  worst of the storm has passed.  I hope so.  You've weathered it.  Weather the storm.  Yeah, have some crackers and soup.  Hey, we should go to the FU line.  A ounce of prevention's worth a pound of cure.  There's a lot to do.  When we come back, we should talk about the 25 sexiest, uh, women.  25 sexiest women segment of the show. 
[00:17:30]  Also, we have a grand prize for our Naughty Nighty contest, Anthony.  Pretty good one.  Grand prize trip to Edenism.  Get your F on.  Get your F on.  Yeah.  Smoke some pot and screw.  Hopefully some more ladies will show up here in New York for the Naughty Nighty contest.  All you have to do is show up between now and seven with your Naughty Nighty.  We'll take your pictures and we'll put you up on the website.  Okay?  Uh-huh.  All right.  And, uh, there was a few other things, but...  Oh, yeah.  Oh, we got lesbians outside.  Oh.  Wow.  Look at me with the afterthought.  They're really hot, Anthony.  Lipstick lesbians from some website. 
[00:18:00]  And we'll get to know them in a little bit, okay?  Right.  But first, it's the FU line.  Hey, thanks for calling, and here's the Opie and Anthony FU line.  Hey, this is a big f*** you to the Canadian customs at the border for not letting me cross  into Canada to go bang my girlfriend because I had an expired passport and they  said I wanted to stay there and work.  Who the f*** in their right mind would want to stay there in Canada and get a job?  Get real, you F***.  F*** you. 
[00:18:30]  Next message.  I want to give a big F-U to my wife of over 20 years who decided she don't want to get put  out no more.  A big F-U.  Next message.  Yeah, this is Stacey, and I want to give a big F-U to my employers for putting us in  the World Trade Center where I almost got killed and then moving us four F-ing times.  And then today, after posting really good earnings for last year, telling us they don't have enough 
[00:19:00]  money for raises and bonuses.  Go F yourself.  End of message.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  Yeah, you're checking out the O.B. and Anthony Show.  The Strokes last night.  They're playing a night at the Mercury Lounge in New York City under another name.  Oh, yeah.  They're calling themselves the...  Soft White Underbelly.  They're calling themselves the S.E. Beatles.  Oh, really?  Can't say the words, so we'll just say the... 
[00:19:30]  Oh, the...  The Itty...  The Itty Beatles.  Sure, why not?  All right.  And it reminds me about something, Anthony.  Whoa.  So I get this food poisoning.  I'm still thinking it's food poisoning.  Matter of fact, this doctor's going to back me up.  No, he's not, because I can't go to him.  Damn it.  Aw.  Yeah, all right.  Will, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I don't know what that lady was talking about when she just called, because, like, a staph  or a cockle food poisoning has an onset time of, like, three hours. 
[00:20:00]  That's...  That would be accurate.  Uh, sir, isn't that a lot more serious?  Uh, it's not real serious.  It'll go away by itself.  Oh, a staph infection will go away by itself.  Yeah, like a food-borne staph infection.  And what was she saying about a fever, too?  She said there was no fevers with...  Yeah, she said that.  I have a slight fever.  I have achy legs.  I'm not, uh...  Get a thermometer.  I'm not blowing mud anymore.  Or, have John run down at Dwayne Reed.  Get a thermometer.  I want your temperature taken.  You don't think I have a fever? 
[00:20:30]  I think...  Even for, uh, like, salmonella...  Let me just say something.  Ben was even saying it.  You get sick more than anyone else we ever knew in our lives.  I haven't taken a sick day in over a year, my friend.  Well, you won't take a sick day.  Yes.  That's how we know you're sick a lot.  You come in.  We all do, though.  And I think after...  You come in sick.  I come in sick.  I rarely get sick.  Not quite.  But I think when you think you have a fever, I think you start, like, you get into being  sick.  Not that you enjoy it.  I think you're like... 
[00:21:00]  That's okay.  I'll use that word a little.  You're calling me a hypochondriac?  I think there's a touch of a hypochondriac in you.  I'm achy.  John, go to Dwayne Reed.  I want a thermometer.  Holy yes.  I could prove that I'm not a hypochondriac.  98.6 will prove it.  Nope.  Nope.  Nope.  Nope.  I'll prove it.  No.  Get Rick right now.  You want to bet on the temperature?  Get Rick.  I'll bet you on your temperature.  Don't get a rectal one either, John.  He probably will.  He will come back with a big rectal thermometer.  Guaranteed I'm over 98.6. 
[00:21:30]  But besides that, I could prove that I had food poisoning.  How?  I told you I've been crapping for 15 straight hours, right?  Where's Rick?  What is Rick going to have to add to this?  Yes, Rick.  Rick, take Jim Norton, get the cell phone.  Oh, no.  And walk to the bathroom where the creep hangs out?  I saw that.  The first stall.  That's me from last night.  Nice.  Good job.  Wait, what is it?  It's not flushing.  Me from last night.  Oh, God.  If you want to call me a hypochondriac... 
[00:22:00]  No, no.  I am saying I believe you have the squirts.  What is in that stall does not come from a person that is not sick.  I believe you have the squirts.  All right.  You don't look like you have a fever, though.  Yeah.  You do not look like you have a fever.  I beat the hell out of that stall, and for some reason it's not flushing, and it's still  F.A.  You saw it, right?  Wait.  Oh, did you videotape it?  No, don't videotape it.  Hey, videotape it.  Videotape it.  Videotape it.  I want you to videotape the cleaning guy when he goes in there tonight. 
[00:22:30]  Rick, go down there with Steve right now.  Why?  Because you get the reaction live on the air.  It's disgusting.  Come on.  Take one of the girls that are here in.  Yeah.  Let's just say it.  I'll bring a girl.  Bring a girl.  I don't want a hot, sexy girl that we're going to try to impress.  Hey, that's impressive.  Blonde, sickly Greg.  Hey, that's not something you see in the toilet every day.  Yeah, I went in to get some paper to blow my nose.  You saw it, right? 
[00:23:00]  Oh, dude, it was awful.  Really?  Does that come from a normal, a guy that doesn't have food poisoning?  A little stomach flu?  No.  I was waiting for a creature to take Adrian Barbeau down there.  I was so embarrassed when the damn thing went flush, so I did what anyone would do.  Oh, well.  What am I going to do?  I've actually left logs in the bowl for my roommate to find.  Like, you just don't flush, and you put the paper around.  And then I would flush.  This is true.  To get my friends to look at it, I would sit in the bathroom for five minutes, then flush.  Then sit down and go and spread the paper out, just so they had to, like, look at it when they went in. 
[00:23:30]  You're sick.  It's true.  Hey, Charlie, what's up?  Hey, what's happening, dude?  Hey, man.  The reason your legs are aching is that most likely you're dehydrated.  That's it.  I'm definitely dehydrated.  When you're esting and all that, you're getting all the licks.  I think they just went numb a few times from sitting on the bowl too long.  You get, what do they call that?  The newborn calf.  The needle.  The newborn calf.  Or the butt hickey. 
[00:24:00]  You get butt hickey.  A ring around the ass.  And then you try to get up and your legs are numb.  Your legs are numb, so you're walking like a newborn foal.  Yeah.  I had all that last night.  I was just walking.  You've got to drink some liquids.  Don't go to the hospital, though, because they'll throw it in a...  I've been drinking liquids like crazy, and I haven't had to take one league.  That's why I know I'm dehydrated.  Maybe you were sitting there a little too long reading a Harold Robbins novel.  Your rod got caught under the bowl seat, and you tripped and fell and hurt your legs. 
[00:24:30]  All right, Charlie, thank you.  Yeah, actually, there is a website, though.  You can go...  ....com.  Thank you.  Let's see.  I think I've had that cut off.  John from Sacramento saying he's faking it.  Next, he's going to be wearing a bandage on his head and an eye patch.  John also from Sacramento writes,  I wonder if the coming storm will compare it to the downpour in Opie's pants.  But anyway, so I was watching the clock every 20 minutes, whatever, okay?  Yeah.  I'm going off on another little tangent here, but it's entertaining. 
[00:25:00]  So I finally get to sleep.  Yeah.  And the phone rings.  And it took me forever to get to sleep because of the stomach, the whole mess that was going on.  It's drunk Ben.  Drunk Ben was making his phone calls.  Drunk Ben making his...  What time was that?  It was like 11.  No way was it 11.  No way was it 11.  You were snotty.  Dude, it was...  I got home at 11.45.  I know I went to bed early, but it was...  No, dude, it was 11.  It couldn't have been 11.  It was 11. 
[00:25:30]  I can guarantee how much.  Dude, I'm hanging out with the lead singer of The Strokes.  He's going to come on the show tomorrow.  He's going to come on the show.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to bother you, but I'm just hanging out here with him.  He's going to be on the show.  Drunk Ben calls.  Now The Strokes are a pretty hot band.  Yeah.  Ben, where is he?  What?  Where is he?  I don't know.  Ah, Ben.  Then that's what I said to him.  I'm like, yeah, whatever, Ben.  I'm sick.  Whatever, Ben.  I'm like, whatever. 
[00:26:00]  Thanks.  And I hung up.  Of course.  We don't got the guy from The Strokes today.  You mess.  Dude, I'm hanging out with him.  And he's going to come on the show.  He's really cool.  Look at Dan from Hoboken said, Obie has chloroferm legs.  Chloroferm, Gordon.  Someone made a sign last night and brought it to the show and it said chloroferm.  Chloroferm.  They did?  It's a distress factor?  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:26:30]  A guy showed up with a sign.  Chloroferm.  Little faux pas.  Yeah.  Held it up.  Everybody laughed.  He high-fived.  Are we waiting for Rick or no?  I don't know what he was doing.  I see him in the hall.  Yeah.  He's not there.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  Yellow.  Hey, you guys should check out this website.  It's called RaidMyPoo.com.  You go on there, you check out people's craps and you rate them.  No way.  Yeah.  Go, go, go, go.  Hey, Norton would love it.  Dude, I would. 
[00:27:00]  I took Polaroids in my dumps one time and I actually put them on my dresser as a joke.  And an ex-girlfriend came over with her female cousin.  They're like, what is that on your dresser?  You can send them in and they'll rate it for you.  Those are just a lot.  That's hilarious.  How many do they have?  A lot, man.  Tons.  That's funny.  It's like those Rate My Boob websites and stuff.  Top five.  Let's look at the top five.  Number one is Stu Poo. 
[00:27:30]  That's nice.  Nice.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that's a nice little conglomerate.  That's Stu Poo.  All right.  Next one is Poo Poo Pal.  Poo Poo Pal.  Poo Poo Pal.  I bet it has a little friend.  Oh.  Nice.  Oh.  Oh.  Nice.  Rusty tint to the water.  That one left.  Hey, can you add pictures to this website?  Yeah, definitely.  Oh, my God.  Go down that first stone. 
[00:28:00]  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Nice close-up.  The third one is like a big...  It looks like five newborn mice.  Oh, the whole bottom is full.  That's like the Puerto Rican laws because there's six of them in a small area.  Yeah.  Oh, that's gross.  Here's a...  Hey.  All right.  Take it easy, guys.  Hey.  Thank you, man.  This is Stanford Poo.  All right.  Oh, God.  This work of art was dropped by a chick. 
[00:28:30]  A Stanford chick.  A Stanford chick.  She left that.  Wow.  Now, that looks like if you'd crumbled up some cookies in the bowl.  My goodness.  How about that?  Very good.  You want to enter it?  You want to enter yours, Opie?  Yeah.  All right.  We could do that, right?  Let's take it with the digital camera and we'll upload it to that site.  RapeMyPoo.com.  Oh, here's the thermometer.  Oh.  Give me the thermometer. 
[00:29:00]  Prove Anthony wrong.  All right.  I so have a fever.  You know how this works?  Do you put money on this?  Yeah, I don't give a crap.  What do you do?  Put it under your tongue.  Stick it in your tongue.  Wait, wait.  Make sure all the instructions are read.  Why?  It's a thermometer.  Well, because it's electronic.  It takes a little longer.  Aw.  Did you reset it and everything?  Aw, look at him with a little...  No one read anything.  It's kind of weird doing that without a bag to hold on to, isn't it? 
[00:29:30]  Don't make him laugh.  He's got the thermometer under his tongue.  Let's see.  Precautions.  Oral use.  Depress the on-off switch.  The display will read 188.8.  Release the power switch.  The display should read 98.2.  Took it out of your mouth.  For one second.  Disinfect it once again.  Well, it says L.  What is that?  See, because you didn't do it right.  Well, tell me what to do.  Depress the on-off switch. 
[00:30:00]  All right.  What does it say?  188.8.  All right.  Release the power switch.  Where's the power switch?  What?  Huh?  All right.  Hold it down.  Hold this down?  Hold the switch down.  What does it say?  Nothing.  All right.  Let go of it.  All right.  Nothing.  Release the power switch.  Display will show 98.2 for one second, then show L, F, or L, F flashing.  No.  I don't know.  Once the degree sign...  All right.  It shows L.  Once it stopped flashing within 40 to 120 seconds, the correct temperature is indicated? 
[00:30:30]  Oh, you're supposed to put it in your mouth.  All right.  Go ahead.  Here's Rick.  Fire in the bathroom.  Correct.  Hey.  Hey.  What's up?  We need a minute.  Why?  Who is this?  It's Anthony.  Jackass.  Oh.  Oh, now he's going to be...  Hey, we need a minute.  Hey!  Mad box!  What's up?  Shut up.  Jackass.  No, we just went into the men's room, and there's a couple of guys in there. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  So we've got to wait until they're out.  Okay.  So...  Well, I guess we'll get back to you, then, because...  Yeah, I'll call back.  We're taking OB's temperature right now.  Rectally, I hope?  No, don't be stupid.  Okay.  All right.  Bye.  Once...  Okay.  Position the probe orally.  Blah, blah, blah.  Once the degree sign on the display has stopped flashing...  Does it stop flashing?  Mm-mm.  Okay.  Then you keep it in there.  This is usually within 40 to 120 seconds.  The correct temperature will be indicated. 
[00:31:30]  The temperature reading will not change after the Fahrenheit stops flashing.  So...  Still flashing?  Yeah.  All right.  Well, you just hold it there.  Is it beeping?  Yeah, it's 36.1.  Centigrade?  Yeah.  Son of a bitch.  You're supposed to put it in Fahrenheit.  Well, do the math.  What's 36?  Let me see.  Do the math.  36.1.  36.1 degrees centigrade. 
[00:32:00]  Right.  Son of a bitch.  Centigrade.  I don't know what...  Who uses that?  Centigrade is...  Bagot Canadians.  What is it?  What was it?  This whole thing is in centigrade.  What is it?  31?  Who got this?  John, obviously, right?  What is it?  36.1.  36.1.  That's good.  36.1.  You got a chart on there?  No.  What did you go for this?  Vancouver? 
[00:32:30]  Hey, Rick.  Rick?  I got to find it on a website.  All right.  36.1.  Don't forget that.  Joe, what's going on?  Hey, we've got a...  There's another website called urinalpoop.com.  So, it's Rape My Poo and now urinalpoop.com.  Urinalpoop, yes.  You get to go and they poop in the urinals.  And then they take pictures of it.  He's like the poop terrorist.  The poop terrorist? 
[00:33:00]  That's great.  We'll have to get these websites up on foundrymusic.com, our underground website.  It's great.  All right.  Thanks, dude.  We'll check that out, too.  Thanks.  Bye.  Later.  Oh, come on now.  Okay.  What is it?  36.1.  Enter the temperature in Celsius to be converted.  Okay.  Thirty-what?  Thirty-six point one.  Six point one.  Convert.  Fahrenheit.  Ninety...  Ninety-six point nine.  How's that? 
[00:33:30]  Ninety-eight point six is your right temperature.  Right.  You're below.  You're dying.  You have an opposite fever.  That can't be.  It can, actually.  You're just running cool.  Running cool?  Yeah.  A temperature can fluctuate a couple of degrees either way on a human.  What?  Yeah.  It's like 97 degrees.  You're a final fever.  I should have bet you.  Now we have a thermometer.  Who's going to use it? 
[00:34:00]  Give it to Norton.  See if he's got the high five.  Frenchy, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  All right.  Okay.  Thirty-six point what?  One.  One, well, the temperature, body temperature is thirty-seven point, uh, thirty-seven point  seven.  What?  Thirty-seven point two.  That's the regular temperature.  Wait, dude.  If it's thirty-six point one, he's saying the average, what you should be is thirty-seven  point two.  Thirty-seven point two.  Oh, okay.  Thirty-seven point two is the regular temperature of the body.  You French in your stupid Celsius.  Well, suck it. 
[00:34:30]  Die.  And ate your brain.  All right.  Bye, Frenchy.  All right.  Bye.  There you go.  Reheat the oven to one hundred fifty Celsius.  What's wrong?  Bit over.  Bit.  What's the matter?  Flushed.  Pete walks right in there and he flushes the toilet.  Well, I heard the guys talking about it on the air.  Get him in here.  Why did he do that?  I walked in and verified what Opie was talking about.  You saw it, right?  I saw it.  Could have been a winner.  I saw it. 
[00:35:00]  On RateMyPoo.com, though.  We were going to put that up on RateMyPoo.com.  It was murky.  It was murky.  It was bad.  Where is Pete?  Ask him why he's fucked in my toilet.  I'm going to be constantly entering photos into this page now.  This is the greatest.  Yeah.  That's a good one.  This one can't be real.  Let me go to Brittany.  Brittany, what's up?  If you go to SmellyPoo.com, you could send poop to people, and they tell you all kinds  of weird facts about poop. 
[00:35:30]  Ooh.  Weird facts.  Oh, really?  Fun facts.  And also, if you...  What does it mean if it's cloudy?  Yeah.  If you multiply...  Hold on, Brittany, because we've got to go to Pete Johnson.  Hey.  Ben's got Pete Johnson down the hall, Anthony.  Hello?  Ben.  Yeah, hang on.  I've got to get Pete the phone.  He doesn't want to come down the hall.  All right.  Ask him, man.  Ask him.  Hello?  Hey.  Why did you flush? 
[00:36:00]  I didn't know why the girls were going in.  I thought they were going in there to dress or something.  So, you know, it was very disgusting.  So, I figured I was doing a service.  Well, that's what we were talking about, Pete, and we kind of wanted to see what it looked  like.  Well, I didn't know.  I wasn't listening to what you were saying.  Of course not.  Here's the thought.  You're in the building.  I thought this was a recorded show.  I didn't know it was live.  Hear the show.  I thought it was an old show that you were rerunning.  There you go.  Thank you, Pete.  Okay, you're welcome, Pete.  Okay, Pete. 
[00:36:30]  Thanks for ruining the bit.  Okay.  Bye.  So, he just figured it was disgusting and needed to flush the toilet.  But the question is, I thought it wouldn't flush.  How come he just flushed it immediately?  You just left it in there.  I don't know.  With your little antisocial behavior.  He's an engineer.  He can figure these things out.  I don't know.  I tried it.  That was anger.  That's why you left that in there.  You're angry at people.  Opie, I don't get angry at myself like you.  No, at people.  I'll give you a little quiz.  What is three quarters of your average turd made of?  Um...  Earl.  Fiber.  No. 
[00:37:00]  No.  Three quarters of your average turd.  Um...  Consist of...  Wait, wait, wait.  It's always...  It tastes gummy.  Um...  Protein?  Um...  No.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Roughage.  You can't say the S word.  Stop.  No.  Roughage?  No.  Three quarters.  Carbohydrates.  No, it's one of those wacky questions. 
[00:37:30]  It's almost the trick cue of the day.  Water.  Water.  Water.  Water makes up three quarters of your average piece of crap.  No way.  Yes.  That's a trick question.  Three quarter.  Water.  Water.  It is.  About, uh...  And then there's the digestible cellulose or undigestible cellulose and fiber stuff.  And, uh...  Why does it stink?  Um...  Because it's, uh... 
[00:38:00]  Organisms are, uh...  Bacteria.  Right.  Sulfur-rich organic compounds.  Mm-hmm.  Why is it brown?  Uh...  I used to know this.  Uh...  Uh...  I don't know.  Oh, uh...  That's the waste product of the bacteria?  Well, it's a pigment that arises from the breakdown of red blood cells in the liver and bone marrow.  Ugh.  Mm.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Fun facts to learn about. 
[00:38:30]  What other colors of poop are possible?  Well, we need to know...  Mostly shades of brown or yellow.  For some, uh...  For example, someone with a bleeding ulcer might have tarry black, uh, waste.  Like Earl had that.  Tarry black waste.  What about green?  Green, yes.  Too much vegetables.  Uh...  It says, uh...  Well, they could be, uh, bleeding from a fissure or a split.  Can stain the, the, uh, waste red. 
[00:39:00]  And some illnesses and babies give them green or even blue-green.  Uh, waste.  Brightly colored foods can pass through almost unchanged.  Like corn?  Yeah.  And yellow.  It could be yellow.  Green.  There it is.  What causes green?  Healthy people can have green waste if they eat a diet rich in leafy green vegetables.  Or consume large quantities of food coloring.  I know these things because I've seen them all in my chest. 
[00:39:30]  That's insane.  Well, oh boy.  A bunch of, uh, fun poop facts you can get at, uh, smellypoop.com.  Hey, can we play the, uh, Buddy Epson thing from yesterday as we go to break here?  Are the lesbians almost ready?  Sure.  You sure they still want to hang out with us?  Yeah, let it see.  All right.  And, uh, why does some poop hurt?  Uh, too much.  They can get very large and dry if a person's constipated, stretching the, uh, opening. 
[00:40:00]  Oh.  Also, if you have, uh, roids, it can hurt.  Or varicose veins of the anus.  Ah.  That's old ass.  Which suggests valves in the veins that are supposed to get the blood flowing in the right direction have gotten messed up.  Oh, God.  All right, and is it possible to vomit poop sometimes of a person suffering from an extremely rare condition or disorder? 
[00:40:30]  Hey, you want to make out?  There you go.  All right.  You could, you could puke.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah, okay.  That's fascinating.  Sometimes it makes you deaf.

So, now, what is going to make us, after you girls leave, still talk about the website?  Well, every time we get to come out, we bring our luscious lipstick lesbian lover to take  out.  And then you have to, when you are the judges, you decide who's the luscious lesbian lover.  Judges, lesbians, right? 
[00:49:00]  Syphilis, I get it.  I'm getting lost here.  We need a luscious lipstick lesbian wheel.  Luscious wheel.  So, we need to spin it and find out what we got to do to promote the website.  I think we could just come up with things.  Right.  Yeah.  Hey, Rick, why don't the ladies get another glass of wine?  Okay.  In the green room?  Yeah.  And maybe they'll make more sense in 15 minutes.  We'll have you come back.  I'm just kidding.  We'll have you come back in, yeah, about 15 minutes.  Okay.  We like you guys.  Kind of work out something, maybe.  I got some ideas going in your head. 
[00:49:30]  So, you're going to drop you.  Yeah.  Oh, look at that, Norton, right?  I am.  Yeah, hi.  It's nice to meet you.  Oh, my God.  He's got the syphilis.  He's got the ninja.  Syllabus.  Yeah.  Syllabus?  No, I don't have AIDS.  I don't have AIDS.  I used to, but I beat it with Tylenol.  Nice.  I really recommend the leave.  The leave would be much better.  There we go.  All right.  So, they're going to get a little drunker, Anthony.  What?  Patrick, what's going on? 
[00:50:00]  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, DeVito, what's up?  What's up, DeVito?  It's Patrick.  Big Pete's friend.  She went to get another glass of wine.  Yeah.  Hey, I got an idea.  Why don't we check Norton's crap to see what man junk's waist looks like when it goes through  you?  I don't like that implication, sir.  You're saying that DeVito, or whatever her name is, she'll do anything?  No, no.  She's an awesome chick, dude.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Language, young man.  Watch that.  I forgot.  I forgot.  All right, cool. 
[00:50:30]  We'll get him back in here, and we'll have him do some stuff.  Yeah, she's awesome.  All right.  Thank you, bro.  Later, guy.  Bye.  Oh, I'm so horny, man.  Let's go to Tom.  Tom, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yo, what's up?  Hey.  These bros are so annoying.  You should just let Norton rape her and smash her face on a curb.  You know, sir, I like it.  Well, that's why we made him leave the studio for a while.  Raper and smash her face on a curb.  All right. 
[00:51:00]  That's a suggestion.  Should we mull over maybe what we want him to do?  Yeah.  Bobby Bigrigger.  Oh, hey.  What's going on?  Hey, listen.  I'm confused.  Would now be a good time for me to keep my chin up?  We're going to turn this thing around.  I really hope so, guys.  All right.  Keep your chin up.  Later, boys.  Thank you, Bobby.  Oh, man.  Well, I don't think they know why they're here, Anthony.  I don't either.  They have a website that I don't know what it is because there's extra Zs and Ss and stuff.  Do you see our high-level? 
[00:51:30]  I don't like when people get cute with their website address.  Yeah, I know.  Keep it simple.  If someone else has the luscious lesbian website, then you come up with another name instead  of adding Ss and Zs so yours is different, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right?  I don't like the...  I don't like just the plugging and, like, no action.  Exactly.  I don't like that.  Bring in the girls again.  You got time to see their face.  I will.  All right. 
[00:52:00]  Be brave.  You're going to rub someone's mural bag in here.  I'm going to be brave.  I'm going to be...  I'm going to...  I'm going to...  I'm going to...  I'm going to...  I'm going to...  I'm going to...  Hold on.  This is Erin who's getting naked again.  Yes, Erin?  I thought...  I thought that I could make it.  I'll talk to people in the club and then we come.  Bring people to VIP club where we work.  It's like...  He can be my judge here and say how nice my ta-tas are, how nice my ass is.  You're going to do that?  You know what?  For the show, I will.  You've got a guy.  For the show?  For the show.  All right.  So she's completely naked in front of you. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, what is that?  Is that...  I'm her...  Grab them right.  Grab them right.  I'm being nice.  Now, where do people need to go?  I'm going to go.  VIPs or this studio because these are amazing.  Amazing.  Yeah, and now you're getting help there.  I know.  And I'm very happy with that.  From behind you.  Ladies, Anthony wants to talk to you though.  But this is good now.  Now we're getting to see some action.  This is a little better, right?  Yeah.  You know what?  I don't enjoy the massive plugging.  I don't have a website without any action.  But now I'm seeing action. 
[00:53:00]  Yes.  Which is good.  Action.  Yes.  I'm not talking about your pants there, Norton.  Rick is telling me that syphilis has a lot of bruises on her body.  Yeah.  Do you?  What happened?  What's the matter?  Don't you listen?  I sprained my bum the other night.  You what?  I'm wearing these wicked high heels and I sprained my bum.  You sprained your bum.  Yeah.  I was trying to do an errand split.  He does these raunchy splits, right?  Yeah.  Who does the raunchy splits?  Aaron does.  Oh, let's see.  Oh, how cute.  Here, get her up on the console for one of these raunchy splits there, Steve. 
[00:53:30]  Oh, where can I do it here?  Oh, my God.  He's good.  I tried to do it.  Yeah.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I can't do it.  Blah, blah, blah.  Oh, let's get...  Blah, blah, blah.  Ladies and gentlemen, can you tell that they're hot?  Yeah.  They would not have lasted this long.  Gone.  Give me that line.  All right.  There they go there.  Aaron, get a button.  Bringing her up on the console.  Watch that button.  Wow-wee.  You like that, Norton?  Wow, look at that.  Her foot is right in your lap there, Norton, isn't it? 
[00:54:00]  Oh, she's lovely.  Impressive.  Wow, that's pretty good.  Very impressive.  Yeah, slap that ass.  There you go.  Very, very good.  Wow.  Oh.  Wow, that's a cute little move.  Wait here.  Let me see.  All right.  What's going on?  Move your arm, Ben.  Oh, there we can see.  That's some action.  There's some...  What do they call that?  Diddling.  Let's pick lesgy action right there.  Yeah.  There's a digit.  Oh, look at that.  That's like the still shot from the magazines, though.  They aren't good. 
[00:54:30]  Because, you know, you're making her laugh.  Yeah, right, right, right.  She has a lovely hiney.  You like that?  Yeah.  Thanks, Mom.  Nice.  All right.  Well.  Oh, did we tell you we work at VIP, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You said that, too.  Jay, what's up?  You have?  You guys got to do the taint set.  Taint?  Have you ever been there?  Nice.  Do you want to do that, Ope?  Do you want to spank that ass out, Norton?  She thinks you're me.  You suck.  You're me.  Listen to me.  I'm sorry if I did it too hard. 
[00:55:00]  Norton.  I'm just sick today, and I had diarrhea.  She thinks it's up.  You're such an ass.  She's just a whiner.  She whines every time I think.  Are you girls into the golden discipline?  The golden...  I tried.  You can't say it that way.  So don't say it ever again.  No, we call it the yellow discipline.  That's all.  Now you tell us.  Yeah.  So any of you girls into that?  Because he loves it.  No, I had an ex-boyfriend that used to do that. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, really?  Used to do it to you?  Yes.  He'd do it to you?  Yes.  It was ridiculous.  I would smack him every time.  Oh, we can't say that.  Yes, yellow discipline.  Oh, boy.  All right.  You can't quite put it that way.  That's why we haven't said it that way.  She's saying it right, though.  Yeah, well...  Yeah, but no...  That's just not...  I've got to learn...  I've got to learn here, guys.  Yeah.  You say a salty yellow beverage.  Wait, now there's toys being...  What is that? 
[00:56:00]  Batteries.  We need batteries.  The pocket rocket.  Oh, the pocket rocket.  We are bringing in...  The Saudi Arabia chick needs batteries, Anthony.  Honestly, at least every day, two times a day.  Have we checked that for explosive devices?  You know where she's from, right?  Do we have any...  Check her shoes.  Do we need the real deal?  Oh, no.  She's trying to light the vibrator, Ann.  She's trying to light the vibrator.  Oh, my God.  The leopard print vibrator.  The vibrator ball.  Oh, you know what?  Actually...  Oh, yeah.  That'll have you going to get... 
[00:56:30]  Right.  Yeah.  I see the sexy...  All right.  Well, while we're getting batteries and whatnot, one of you girls go sit down on the couch,  drink a little more.  We'll get the batteries, and then we'll bring you back in.  Okay.  All right, girls?  There you go.  Steve, show them the couches and the beverages, and...  Yeah.  There you go.  Yeah, that's your wine.  Syphilis.  There you go.  Syphilis.  Go on.  All right, there's Wiggy.  Oh, Norton, stop working it.  Oh, you don't know.  You're right...  He's right over there, sitting there, just working, kneading it.  I'm really ready to arc one. 
[00:57:00]  He's kneading it like dough.  He's just like...  Don't touch it.  He's scratching his nips, and...  I was doing that in Vegas.  I didn't know I was doing it, and I was getting a lap dance in Vegas, and my friend, we left,  he goes, dude, you were just sitting there tweaking your nipples.  And I'm like, oh, was I?  Oh, God.  Yeah.  A lot of people pissed off that we have a girl from Saudi Arabia in our studio.  Oh, stop.  Hang up on them.  What are you going to do?  They're like, I don't care if she's hot.  Get her out of there.  Oh, please.  Oh, stop.  Easy for you to say.  I'm not going to condemn a whole bunch of people for the actions of a few. 
[00:57:30]  Almost all of them, yeah.  Balloon Not Joe, what's up?  Hey, fellas, what's this chick's website again?  Is it annoyingchicks.com?  You guys sound like you're sitting in the middle of a baby shower.  I feel bad for you.  It's not too good.  They're hot, though.  Hey, Rick.  That's the problem, Balloon Not Joe.  They're hot.  Oh, I know.  But good luck.  But ditch the arrows.  Later.  This is how guys, you know, act, I don't even know.  See, it's easy on the phone, though, to go, eh, get rid of them. 
[00:58:00]  But when you're in front of them and they're putting their heinies near you, well, by golly,  that's fine conversation.  Oh, that's you, Norton.  Hey, Rick.  It's like a little selfish.  Our listeners don't get that perk.  Well, I'm as disgusting as any of your listeners.  Hey, Rick.  Yo.  Do these girls have a plan?  I'm giving them a plan.  Have you talked to them?  Do they understand what this is about?  They're very giddy.  I don't think they've had enough to...  I don't care about getting...  Should we do the taint thing, maybe?  No.  I think what it's going to take is just bringing in one of our new Ikea couches. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  But is it going to be...  I think that'll be good.  All right.  All right.  Jerry, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's up?  Hey, man.  Hey.  These chicks are so annoying.  See?  It's time to send these chicks to the room, and I don't know what you're going to do with  these girls.  They must be good-looking, because I can tell you right now that I'm about to run my car  off the road.  See?  Let's bring syphilis back in with the Saudi Arabia girl and Aaron. 
[00:59:00]  Why?  Because I want to tell them that the listeners are saying they're annoying.  Yeah.  I got a chocolate bomb.  She's got a chocolate bomb now.  I got a chocolate bomb.  Nice.  I got a chocolate bomb.  I got to tell you, that looks disgusting.  We found your box of toys out there.  Yeah, the chocolate on your ass does not look good.  Chocolate body frosting?  It looks like the last break we were doing.  Hey, ladies?  Yes?  Our listeners are saying that you're annoying.  Yeah, we're like getting a lot of calls and letters that say... 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, they're not happy.  ...that say you guys are like really annoying.  Well, what would they like us to do some lessons?  I don't know.  I don't know.  That's why we brought you back in and tried to figure it out.  Yeah.  Look at Steve and they can stick to hearing your dialogue instead.  Oh.  Oh.  That's good.  We're not entertaining now.  Well, that's good.  Hey, Syphilis, listen up.  It's not...  We didn't say this.  I'm just telling you what the listeners are saying and then you've got to give us...  Then you give us a little jab.  Well, maybe you guys want to check out, actually, my site. 
[01:00:00]  My name is Amy.  Yeah.  And you can go to www.therealwife.com and see what this girl looks like.  Then we'll quit complaining.  All right, Amy.  Hey, come down to VIP and watch us bust out our moves and we have no dialogue.  See, this is the stuff they're not taking, Hopi.  No, no, no, no.  This is the stuff that they're not...  You've got to listen to Anthony.  You've got to listen to Anthony on this one.  This is the kind of stuff that the listeners are...  They're hating.  Look, I will click this right...  Yeah, but they can't see anything. 
[01:00:30]  They can't see anything.  Annoying.  Put these...  Fill...  Look at this.  Fill the potholes with these girls.  Oh, come on.  That's not nice.  That's not nice.  Oh, no.  That's not nice.  Maybe Norton should fill them up with some brain juice.  Oh.  They're saying.  I am reading them as they're coming off of the wire here.  I like Erin, though.  She's working it.  Look, she's naked.  Tell them to stop plugging and pleasure each other.  Licking chocolate off a hiney.  All right.  There she's licking some chocolate.  All right.  There's some chocolate off of that stuff. 
[01:01:00]  Vaguely.  Yeah.  Okay.  It's nice.  It's nice.  All right.  There we go.  Now smack her ass a little.  And right hook to the face.  You could have done that to Opie for 15 hours yesterday.  I smack.  You lick.  How's that?  All right.  Smacking and licking, maybe?  They're working together, finally.  Excuse me.  Past the point of no return, Opie.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  You know what past the point of no return is?  It means it doesn't matter what they do now.  I'm going to guess one of their ages, I think.  Dan wants to know, where's the chloroform when you need it? 
[01:01:30]  Dan, call back.  What would you like?  Well, Dan, we're like representatives of the audience.  So we would like the Ikea couch brought in, full nude sex hijinks.  Litter box, maybe.  What about the Motley Crue challenge?  What's the matter?  What about Silifus?  We don't care about Silifus.  Or period, or anything.  None of it matters.  Or period. 
[01:02:00]  Do one of you girls, maybe that's what it is?  Are you having your friend?  I'm having the time.  Well, with the Silifus in all.  Right now?  Are you?  Be careful.  Ragging, I know.  Are you?  Ragging.  Ragging.  Ragging.  All right.  All right, what are they doing now over there?  I'm just getting this stuff off now.  You have a little on your midriff.  I did.  What are you going to do about that?  You have a little bit out there for me to be there?  All right, there's more licking.  All right.  All right.  Well, good.  You got to hand it to them.  That's nice. 
[01:02:30]  It's not working for me.  All right, Rick.  Why don't they get some more wine?  Yeah.  These are very, I'm sorry.  A little more wine will...  I can't handle this stuff.  I can't handle it.  I'm not that sure.  We will...  Water.  Yeah, get some more wine or water or whatever.  Wine.  Okay.  Vodka.  Vodka.  Heroin.  And then we'll call you back in at later.  Yes, you guys are going to bring our props in.  We've got the pocket rocket now.  Yeah, the pocket rocket.  You guys are going to bring in the Ikea.  We've got a battery.  Yeah, we'll give you a tool. 
[01:03:00]  We've got a battery?  You've got a battery there, Rick?  You guys bring three girls in here to stand here, and then you wonder why they're bored.  No, no, not to stand there.  Let me tell you...  Okay, ladies.  We need the wheels.  Hold the phone.  Let me tell you something.  We have plenty of things you can do.  We've had girls in here that have gotten naked and have taken no direction from us.  They had the...  We're warming up.  They were able to just go on their own and do things that, quite frankly, amazed us.  That's all.  We're warming up.  You know, I know you have the pocket rocket.  You're warming up.  That's okay. 
[01:03:30]  I'm seeing the people whining up there.  Well, let them go warm up a little more.  All right.  There's nothing wrong with warming up.  A little more wine, perhaps.  Find the tools.  We've got the Norton's junk.  Take a good look at Norton's junk.  It's meaningless right now.  There's nothing going on.  Is it?  Look at my gut.  Oh, a knee.  You're getting a little leg job.  Nice.  You're getting a leg job.  All right.  We're getting warmed up, too.  All right.  I think they're good, though.  I like these three.  We have Norton to dance, all three of us at one time.  I'm telling you. 
[01:04:00]  I think they're true.  All right.  Good girls.  We'll bring the couch in.  Sure.  Why don't they go hang out, have some more drinks, and we'll bring you back in.  There they go.  There they go.  Oh.  Oh.  Kissing going on.  Kissy face going on.  That had an inch and a half.  Did it?  Yeah.  Look at that.  Dude, don't get rid of him.  Dude, don't get rid of him.  He's the most selfish son of a bitch.  We think about our listeners. 
[01:04:30]  That's right.  For the most part.  We are so ready to kick into the curb so we can do a good radio show today.  And Norton, dude, don't get rid of him.  He's totally just thinking of himself.  I'm a sex addict.  I'm a perv.  It's not like a little goofy thing I do.  Like, uh-oh, time to put on my perv hat.  I don't care about listeners.  I care about mule and juice flowing from it.  We're doing a radio.  I'm a disgusting man.  That's the price you pay.  That's fine if you go to a bar for happy hour, but we're doing a radio show, you idiot.  I know.  I'm a dirt bag.  I'm a mule and juice flowing from it. 
[01:05:00]  That's brilliant.  You're going to hang with us.  You've got to understand the sacrifices you've got to make sometimes to make good radio.  I suck.  You're like...  You have no clue that this sounds horrible, right?  No, I do.  I'm not even thinking about it.  He doesn't even care.  It wasn't for the headphones.  He doesn't even care.  He doesn't care.  No.  Yeah, if it wasn't for the headphones, you wouldn't even...  Would you stop rubbing?  Oh.  Chill out.  Jesus, man.  All right.  We're going to...  Rubbing.  Yeah, we're going to take a break and regroup then.  All right.  Point the...  Where's the stinky cam? 
[01:05:30]  Right over there.  Point it toward the mics.  People need the stinky cam?  So that when...  Just check it out on the thing.  Is that good?  Get you real after that.  No one wants to see your mule on the stinky cam.  There we go.  All right.  Well, put the stinky cam on.  Jeez.  Ryan, what's up?  Hey, how are you?  I was just wondering how good looking you have to be to be that stupid.  I mean, they better be worth it because it's not worth it here.  See, Jim?  Dude, I really think with these three... 
[01:06:00]  They're not like those other girls.  I think these three will definitely do more.  I really do.  No.  On the couch?  For your sake, I hope so.  I've seen this before.  That's right.  Dude, I say we cut our losses.  Yeah.  I say we cut our losses.  I say you've got to give them another chance.  Look at Jim.  You're panicking.  No, I'm not going to bang me.  You're panicking.  I say we cut our losses.  Strippers never bang me.  What do you think?  You want to break the news to them?  Colin.  All right, bring them back, Jim.  Yeah.  Oh, and...  They've passed the point of no return.  Look at Jim.  They've passed the point of no return, I think. 
[01:06:30]  Jim, we're syndicated to 18 cities.  We've got to make it sound good.  We all have meals.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Here comes...  Where's my couch?  She watched the couch.  Well, um...  Where's my couch?  Anthony has something to say to you girls.  Well, girls, um...  I'm looking at the listener feedback responses from listener feedback, and it's not working out.  Why don't we have Jim tell them?  It's not working out. 
[01:07:00]  Jim, could you explain?  I know we were reading it out there.  This is great.  But these guys have no idea what we look like.  They have no clue.  They're bored.  You bored them to death, Anne.  That's what you can do.  They are very hot, these girls.  And they're a boring bird.  Yeah.  They want to be...  Look at Jim.  Jim, it's not about you.  You're absolutely right.  And, you know...  And for the people that all think we're stupid, you know, we're really not as...  I'm a lot dumber than I look.  You're not a lot dumber than you look?  A lot dumber than I look.  You're a lot dumber than you look?  You're a lot dumber than you look?  I know.  You look like a logical orientation, but I'm a lot dumber. 
[01:07:30]  I just like to have a good time.  No, she's not dumb.  Norton, if you'd explain it a little better.  If you want to be part of this radio show, as the English girl sitting on your lap.  It's your job to...  Yeah, do you guys want us to lap dance for you?  Is that what we're trying to get?  To be the bearer of bad news.  What happens to us?  We'll have Erin and DeVito from VIPs, and you'll have Amy.  Ladies, Jim has something to say to you.  Jim.  Jim, you can't say it, can you?  Not with two girls on your own.  I'm a big fan of...  Well...  Oh, boy.  They're all over.  Maybe. 
[01:08:00]  They're all over.  Well, Norton.  Jim.  Could you explain it, Jim?  Jim, can you get your face out of there and say something on the microphone?  Jim.  You can't say it.  Jim.  What?  Jim.  I love boobs.  I'll be at the Stress Factory tonight and tomorrow.  Oh, no, no, no.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, Jim.  Do you have something to say?  Jim, what do you have to say to the ladies?  Um...  Don't say it.  I'm...  I'm...  Oh, boy. 
[01:08:30]  I can't hear anything.  Oh, boy.  His head is...  I'm...  Jim.  Yes?  Earth.  Keep talking.  Keep talking.  I'm just trying to gather my thoughts.  Well, give me a second.  Focus.  Focus.  All right, Jim.  Okay.  Jim.  There is not a guy in 18 cities that wouldn't want to be me right now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But that's not what you really want to say, is it?  Yeah.  No.  No.  I love you, Jim. 
[01:09:00]  Jim.  Well, I...  Just talk for all the listeners.  Um...  Tell all the listeners.  The VIPs is probably a very good club.  Come by and see us.  Could you, uh...  Explain...  Explain it, uh...  Norton.  Explain the situation.  Being smothered by three girls, yes.  Do you have something to say to these ladies?  I'm really happy you guys are here.  And I...  I hope that so far this experience has been good for you.  I'm a weak man.  Yeah.  Who's the next spokesperson? 
[01:09:30]  We gotta...  We gotta move chairs.  Jim?  Because they didn't come through with our Ikea couch in here.  Yeah, where's our Ikea couch?  How can you want action when you have no Ikea couch in here?  We got no problems.  Can we give them one more shot after the break, maybe?  Well, Norton can't say...  All right, after the break.  But that's it.  All right, ladies.  Ladies.  Hold on, she's asking me a question.  Huh?  Okay.  Would you like to feel the Real Housewives boobies?  All right.  Come on.  Be on, babe.  All right.  Amy, the real wife.com?  Head.  All right, listen.  All right.  Ladies, we'll give you one more shot. 
[01:10:00]  The listeners will give you one more shot.  Yeah.  You guys gotta...  We're gonna take a little break.  You guys gotta go out there, brainstorm, and figure out what you wanna do.  Uh-huh.  You guys gotta bring on our couch in the meantime?  If that's what you want.  That's right.  You tell us what you want.  But go out there and figure it out, okay?  Do a little huddle and figure it out.  Get our toys out here.  We're gonna turn this thing around.  That's right.  You're gonna impress the listeners to the point where they're gonna call up and go,  Oh, my God.  You know.  Make sure they stay.  All right?  One last shot.  All right.  A lot of plugs on the line.  You know that, right?  Forget my plug. 
[01:10:30]  Just watch.  Just watch.  Look, she's very confident.  All right.  I like her.  Do you like me?  Yeah, we like you.  Uh-huh.  There she goes.  All right.  All right, wait.  The listeners think that it's not going the way they want it to.  Yeah, it's not.  They're not happy and they might want you to go.  It's too late, Jim.  They're gone.  Dude, I'm a...  You're such a puss.  I am a weak man.  But I never claimed to be anything but a little...  It was so funny how they just...  They just start smothering you with their naked bodies and you had nothing. 
[01:11:00]  And you can't even get out of it.  And the one was teasing my nipple.  She was giving it a pinch.  A pinch.  A little pinch for the nipple.  All right.  We'll give one more shot after the break.  Huh?  I apologize to the listeners.  I'm with you.  But I'm just...  I'm a dirtbag.  Huh?  I have a headache.  I'd rather go to eatabullet.com.  Oh, thank you, Ed.  That's a fine website.  Rick, what's wrong?  I just got some of the funniest news I've heard.  What?  Well, get the...  It has nothing to do with these ladies.  Wrong mic.  Oh, sorry.  Remember I told you the Iron Sheik they were going to bring him by? 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I was wondering why at 4.30 that he still wasn't here yet?  Yeah.  Turns out he's been stuck in the Rochester airport for the last few hours.  They won't let him on the plane because they think he's a terrorist.  Because he's the Iron Sheik.  Because he's the Iron Sheik and his real name is like Hassan something.  No way.  It's got to be a publicity gag.  They just let him on a jet flu flight, I think.  He's an old man.  They made him take off all his shoes, all his gear.  Was he around the curly shoes?  I think he was.  Because the guy... 
[01:12:00]  His rep was like...  He goes, they had to take off his shoes.  It takes him an hour to get these shoes on and off.  Oh, because they lace off?  Yeah.  The big boots?  Was he wearing the big curly boots like he did in the ring?  Couldn't that jackass wear sneakers on a plane?  I know.  His curly fry boots?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Great.  Well, make sure the ladies, you know, get something planned.  No problem.  They have one more shot at this.  Rick, you've got to do some recon on these girls.  Let us know exactly what we're going to get.  Because if you come in here with a report and it's not going to be good, I don't even want to see it. 
[01:12:30]  I hear it.  Because our listeners come first.  Yeah, Jim.  Jim.  Dude, I agree with you.  You know the sacrifices we have made?  And I'm feeling that this just isn't going the way that other lesbian action in this studio has gone.  I don't want to undermine future lesbian action by having something that isn't quite up to par.  I agree 100% with you two.  I'm just a weak man.  I'm the wrong guy to give that news.  I'll try it again, but I'm not good.  I can't help it. 
[01:13:00]  Dude, stop playing pocket pool.  I can't.  I froze a picture of Norton on the stinky cam.  Let me see.  It's just him surrounded by women, like, with a dopey smile on his face.  Look at him.  He's like, uh-huh.  I'm laughing.  OpianAnthony.com for the stinky cam.  My fat neck.  Dazzle OpianAnthony with your brilliance now.  In New York, call 877-692-1027. 
[01:13:30]  nationally, 866-277-4-WOW.  Opie and Anthony and E.W.  We're back with the OpianAnthony show.  Hey, a couple phone numbers in the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, 866-277-4.  Wow.  Jason has something to say to you, Jim.  Jason, what's going on? 
[01:14:00]  Hey, dude, that was the best.  You know what my problem is?  Norton, how you doing?  What's up, buddy?  I can't say I would have done any better in that situation, but he was like, in order  for Norton to become a made man, he had to take them out, and he failed.  Dude, it's tough, though, man.  He failed.  I'll agree.  Yeah.  Look, I've been telling you I'm a failure since you met me.  I'm not saying I did good.  It's hard to say something negative with hot girls on you.  I'm no stronger than you, dude.  I can't do it.  I know, but Opie and Anthony are the made guys already. 
[01:14:30]  They're the carpools.  They're the bosses.  And they told you, this is what you have to do.  Right.  And I don't know.  Opie, it's up to you guys.  Opie and Anthony make a lot of money.  I'm just a little nobody doing gigs, and I very rarely have strippers on me, sir.  Money has nothing to do with this.  You're right, but I can't.  You fail.  I'm trying to justify my failure.  You have to sacrifice for your listeners, Jim.  Sir, I have fluid coming out all over the place.  Because, like, this instant feedback.  Oh, wait.  Here it is.  Norton is the only real man in there.  You guys are a bunch of freaking homos. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, stop it.  That's what we get, because we're trying to do a good radio show.  Yeah, but the guys.  You look like the hero, and we look like two homos.  No, it's not.  Because we want to move on, and then maybe get something on the air today that someone  will go, wow, that was funny.  I got to tell my friends about that.  It's not that.  The guys understand.  It's difficult to say no with a girl putting her breasts on you.  It's very, I'm not that strong.  I'm dirty.  I want to see that little toy that they brought in someone's doom pair.  That's the only redeeming thing.  Look at Steve going, no, no.  I know. 
[01:15:30]  I could tell.  Nothing's happening, right?  Lydia.  Web chicks.  Lydia.  What's up?  What's up?  All right.  I'm calling from D.C.  Yeah.  And I got to tell you guys, dig up, stupid.  What's the ratings?  These girls, after they said that comment about, I'm dumber than I look.  Yeah.  And you guys got to do better than that for D.C.  You know what?  They come in here and with the chocolate licking thing, that's not, you know something?  It's nothing.  I did that in kindergarten.  We do contests, right?  Where a girl will come off the street and they'll have a lesbian action on a couch and stuff. 
[01:16:00]  And it's great.  We had a bunch of girls on that couch doing a daisy chain of the sickest crap I've ever seen.  Those were the Philly girls.  And you know something?  Didn't have a dot com at the end of it.  Web Chicks, constantly a disappointment on this show.  Constantly.  Never again.  Well, Ben from Freeport wants to rename their website to www.plugtheirmouths.com.  I have never. 
[01:16:30]  I think you could, you know, see how upset I'm getting?  I know.  Check me on this one, Opie.  And now we got another 20 minutes to deal with because you couldn't say get the F out of here.  Dude, I'm a weak man.  I'm the wrong guy for that job.  We gave you a job.  It was an easy job.  I'm the wrong guy.  When someone calls up to criticize the show, that's where I'm good.  But when it's hot chicks and you're saying toss them, I'm the wrong guy.  Check me on this.  Has there ever been website girls that have done anything here that was good? 
[01:17:00]  Please check me on this one.  I really don't know.  To be honest with you, the girl from RondasPlayPen.com.  What did she do?  Everything.  And how do you remember?  Oh, hey.  Bravo.  Hey, Adam.  You see the lovely ladies out there?  What?  You see the lovely ladies out there?  I thought, I just got off a plane.  I had the cab drop me off here.  Nice.  I heard through the static on the radio, all I care about is a mule and the fluid flowing from it. 
[01:17:30]  Right.  I said, well, I want to be a part of this.  You got to get in there.  I just came down the hallway, and there's the girls from middle school confessions out there.  Oh, yeah?  Well, Adam, here's the deal.  What happened?  These three girls, they're lesbians.  They're the luscious lip lesbian variety.  Lipstick lesbians.  Lipstick luscious lip variety.  Whatever.  They got a website.  Okay.  And you know something?  Next.  Right.  Anytime you got a website, there's an agenda, they're selling something.  We gave them three chances.  Nothing.  We had that goddamn midget chick on. 
[01:18:00]  Remember?  She was a website girl, albeit a midget.  But would she go the distance?  No.  There's other website girls.  Oh, yeah, check out my site.  This, this, this.  It's a live cam.  I do this.  I do that.  All right.  Take your clothes off.  No.  Out.  Yeah.  So we gave Jim Norton the job.  So I'm to leave.  You can't do that.  Thank you.  And all of a sudden they smothered him and he just, he just broke down.  Look at this picture of him with the girls.  Look at his face.  Hold on. 
[01:18:30]  Look at his face.  Adam, you know me for eight years.  I'm a weakling.  Look at his face right there.  Is that the happiest retarded boy in the world?  Look at that.  That's him.  With an ice cream.  That's him trying to tell the girls to get lost.  He looks like a little mongoloid kid looking at the cotton candy machine.  I don't blame you.  How does it make the cotton candy?  It's spinning around and it's a color blue.  Let's go on the ferris wheel.  I'm on a corn dog.  His big smiling mongoloid head with these hot chicks over here.  But you know what?  I don't blame Norton because it's Norton being Norton. 
[01:19:00]  I blame you guys.  You guys are like the owners of the snake that eats the baby next door.  Wait a minute.  Why are you blaming us?  I'm kind of responsible because we're...  Because you're responsible.  You know Norton.  We're letting it go too long.  Who gave the gun to the baby?  We're trying to teach him the business.  There's a lot of times where Ant and I go, wow, I would love to check out this girl naked  for the whole show.  But I know out there in Radioland, they're hating this, so we have to tell them to go.  We sacrifice.  Okay.  So we're trying to teach him this lesson and he's failing miserably.  I don't think you can. 
[01:19:30]  I took a little baby step backwards.  You know something?  You know something?  Jim, the listeners are the ones that really are upset about this and pissed off.  We should let some of the listeners tell these girls to go.  I think we should do what we said.  We'll give them one more shot.  But if they don't come through, then you, Jim, have to tell them.  All right, but I'm being...  I'm not even...  I do have faith that they'll come through.  Because they're nice.  They're not annoying and nasty.  Oh, stop with the nice.  I'm telling you.  I think they will.  Stop with the nice.  No, no. 
[01:20:00]  I think...  We out there having a little chat during spots?  Yeah, while we were doing...  You're nice.  While we were making money for the company and doing live reads, he's getting phone numbers.  You're right, I stink.  Nice?  You don't know that from a hole in the wall.  Well...  Well, I know a hole in the wall pretty well.  I certainly do.  A hole in the wall is nice.  Now I see why they call it a buddy booth.  A hole in the wall ain't too bad to get to know, especially when the guy's name's Bob on the other side.  Hello, buddy.  Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.  Watch the splinters. 
[01:20:30]  John, what's up?  They're nice.  All right, I'm going to ask.  Oh, you said that.  Johnny.  Hello.  What's up?  You're on the radio.  Go.  Hey, man.  I don't blame Norton, but this is kind of ridiculous.  I'm from D.C.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  It's pathetic.  They're plugging their stuff and they're not doing anything.  Right.  All right.  Get him in here right now.  We end this now or we get something happening this second.  All right.  Girls, front and center.  Jim.  Look at him.  What did he say?  What did he say? 
[01:21:00]  You know, you're this close.  He's already planning.  He's going to slug trail.  Yeah, he's already planning.  Adam, what did he say?  Explode.  Well, again, he goes, just get.  Let the girls come here.  Go to the other mic.  Go to the other mic.  He's telling Adam to move so the girls can come there and rub his mule.  Jim.  All right, girls.  We have to teach you a lesson today.  Line them up.  Line them up.  We got to be blunt.  All right.  Oh, they look all happy.  Ladies, look how happy they look.  Yeah, they've been drinking a little more.  Go over there.  All right.  You know something?  That's lovely.  She's got a bent over.  The English chick's got a bent over. 
[01:21:30]  Wait.  You've got this couch here for a reason.  Damn it.  Oh, he has a couch.  Oh, he has a couch.  All right.  Couch.  Okay, there's the couch.  Get him over to the couch.  Someone grab the mic and then bring it to the couch there.  Now we'll take a little look.  All right.  All right.  I see a leg in the air.  You know what?  I'm going to be blunt.  I see too many clothes, girls.  Too many clothes.  We get...  Oh, my clothes are the first to go.  What is this?  This one's on.  There we go.  All right.  We got the Ikea furniture in the studio.  Better.  Better.  Cool. 
[01:22:00]  We got this hot scene going here.  Where?  I don't know.  I'm waiting.  Oh.  Oh, there we go.  The other tops come off.  Now they're topless girls.  All right.  They're on the couch.  They're kissing.  All right.  What do you think so far, Adam?  So far it's working.  Is that a scab or chocolate?  It's chocolate.  Chocolate.  That's syphilis.  It's chocolate.  There you go.  That's it.  All right.  Right there, Adam.  So far it's working, but the...  Oh, a little spank.  I like that.  Yeah?  You like that?  Huh?  What?  You know, it would be really great if we hadn't seen acts on that couch that would make 
[01:22:30]  us Satan blush.  I'm sorry, but this is like...  Oh, okay.  Hold on.  Hold on.  This could do something now.  This could do something.  This is the fake lesbian stuff.  Wait a minute.  All right.  That's fake?  Okay.  That's not fake.  All right.  I'm getting a whole new respect for you girls.  Who'd you like, man?  Ma'am.  Wait a minute.  She said no, though, man.  What?  I just wanted on videotape.  He can't...  Oh, don't worry about it.  Okay.  Done.  There we go. 
[01:23:00]  Video's gone?  Don't worry about it.  Video's gone.  Yeah.  All right.  Now we're talking.  Hell, screw the listeners.  Video cameras gone.  This is just for us.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  Now we got something going on.  All right.  Jim, stop!  Go to the bathroom.  Cut off.  Oh, wow.  Wait.  Guys.  All right.  There's some good things going on now.  Yes, sir.  All right.  I just turned the stinky cam on.  All right. 
[01:23:30]  So now they're getting into it now.  All right.  We've got to expect the camera to make us a bit nervous.  Oh, we've got a webcam still.  No, no.  I'm disconnected.  A webcam.  Swear.  Yeah.  All right.  Fair.  Done.  Oh, man.  Look at that.  Now we're talking.  There's the little toy.  There's the little toy you were looking for.  That, now that's the way to plug a website. 
[01:24:00]  That's beautiful.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, okay.  Sure.  See what we're giving you listeners there?  Now you can go to the stinky cam.  Check that out.  I don't know if it's like, oh, yeah.  It's coming in.  Good deal.  Oh, it's right there.  I'm looking right now.  It's a loading of load.  Oh, there you go.  Hey, look at that.  Oh, eat at the Y, as they say.  Vibrates my nose. 
[01:24:30]  Wow.  Wee.  See what?  Oh, that's good.  Vibrating my nose because she's playing.  Hey, what?  You know something?  Why does she have a...  Unless it's being forced there at gunpoint.  Right.  Hardcore action.  What do you mean hardcore action?  Hardcore action.  Oh, they are...  She's...  Oh, my God.  Can you see anything?  Got to work that pimp hand.  Nope.  Well, look better.  There you go.  How is your leg up there?  How come she's wearing those?  Is she uncomfortable?  I know. 
[01:25:00]  I don't think she's comfortable.  Oh!  We like that.  Oh!  All right.  Show us...  Well, she's just being honest.  Show us the flak jacket.  He loves...  Let me tell you something.  Jim Norton loves it.  No.  Believe me.  Like that.  I know.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  He loves it.  I already showed him.  I peeks up.  Peek a little out and show Norton.  Yeah, don't say what you're...  Peek something out.  Peek, peek, peek.  Give Norton a peek.  A peek. 
[01:25:30]  Just for me.  He loves it.  It's ugly.  No, it's not.  No, no, no.  They're beautiful.  Oh, my...  She should give Norton a peek, though, because Norton loves that type.  I really do.  He loves that type.  I know.  I already showed him.  No, her, but she...  No, hers.  Hers.  She showed you.  She showed you and me writing together.  But not like it was quick, though.  That's a good thing.  Yeah?  Like the thing.  Give him a quick peek.  It's okay. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, God.  That's nothing new here.  That's nothing new here.  We love the crime scene.  Yeah, a little thing in there.  No one else.  There you go.  Show Norton, because he loves it.  Be a buddy.  Wait.  Go ahead.  Look at this.  Don't be embarrassed.  The stuff that's growing up.  Go ahead.  Why are you so shy?  Because she got a thing, and she's worried.  You're on a goddamn website.  Oh, no.  She got...  No, it's the thing.  All right.  Okay.  Go fix that.  Come back.  I think Jim needs to...  Go fix that.  What?  Stop begging.  Yeah, I think it's time to... 
[01:26:30]  Stop begging.  I think it's time to get him out of here.  No, she's going to...  We're taking a pause.  She's going to fix that.  Oh, she's going to fix what?  She's going to fix that.  That insecurity.  She's going to come right in.  Oh, she's going to fix that?  Oh, I'm sorry.  She's going to fix that insecurity.  She's going to get rid of it?  It's a tamp, yeah.  Yeah, well, it doesn't matter.  Rick, get up.  I'm sorry.  Am I in the way here?  There you go.  God, am I worthless.  Oh, my God.  All right.  All right.  Yeah, now she's back in the little Red Bull. 
[01:27:00]  She knows where to go.  At least he's doing a little action, man.  That was better, right?  Yeah.  A little better for a while.  Definitely.  They didn't tell us you guys were going to narrate.  Well, what are you...  It's radio.  What did we just sit there?  We have to narrate.  We got to talk a little.  We were talking a little.  Actually, a lot.  But still.  What?  We were talking a lot.  We didn't know you were going to have a couch.  All right.  More wine.  We finally got our couch here.  Do they need more wine at it?  Yeah.  All right.  We're out. 
[01:27:30]  Very good, ladies.  Very good.  Yeah, I'm very happy.  What do you think, Norton?  What do I think?  Was it working for you?  Yeah.  Yeah, Norton.  She's really worried about my other hand, like where it's going to go.  No, but I'll be nice.  Don't worry.  I won't.  Oh, has she swatted your hand away a couple of times?  Did I say I was worried?  No.  Ooh, I like that.  No.  If his hand moved into dangerous territory, would you swat it away?  How dangerous of territory?  I'm talking the most dangerous of territory.  Is that dangerous?  Oh, Newark. 
[01:28:00]  There you go, Norton.  If it went to Newark, would you slap him?  What are you sporting, Norton?  Look at his...  What are you packing?  Wait, wait.  You can't say the S word.  You have to say the S word.  I'm sorry.  You would just smack him.  How's that?  I would smack him.  Yeah.  Oh, his hand was right there.  I've never seen Jim's eyes bugging out like this.  Oh, God.  Bugging out right now.  Norton, would you let her go for the mule if she wanted to right now?  See what Norton's packing. 
[01:28:30]  Check him out.  I got about half.  Is it working?  We're getting closer.  Yeah?  Yeah.  He said he had nothing earlier.  We got a little halfway there.  Look at Norton's face.  I'm on a con dog.  Look at that.  It's like a race.  Oh, wow.  Is it getting better right now?  Yeah, it is.  Look at him.  She is working it.  It's Forrest Gump when he touched Jenny's breasts.  I think I'll ruin your roommate's robe, Jenny. 
[01:29:00]  I am doing that impression.  I'm hacking a rod.  You don't even care.  That's good, right?  She's a trooper.  You digging that?  Yeah.  Is it working?  Is it?  I still have.  You guys turned off the camera.  That's what I'm worried about.  Still have?  Still have, huh?  That's not saying much.  No, it's not a reflection on her.  It's just there's 12 guys staring at me.  What?  That's never talked to before.  You want to touch my back?  Will that help the rest of it?  Where's my music?  I thought I was supposed to give Norton a lap dance. 
[01:29:30]  Put a big back in front of us.  Hey, what happened to the other girl?  She's running away?  Oh, the third one?  Yeah, what happened to her?  I'm not sure.  Bad parenting.  There you go.  I'll give you a little first joke of the day.  I'll give you a little heads up of where she is right now.  All right.  Order to stink!  Order to stink!  Order to stink!  The chair doesn't...  Order to stink!  I don't want to wind up in Ron and Fez's office leaking stuff. 
[01:30:00]  I don't think he's on me.  What's that?  He's just groping.  I know.  I'm sorry.  You're groping now.  I'm a dirty little man.  You are.  I'm being very nice, though.  But yet, no one wants to jump on this wagon.  Everyone wants to pick on him, but no one wants to jump on this wagon.  Wagon?  Wagon.  Wagon?  Wagon.  All right, and we're going to take a break.  All righty.  Let's see what's going on on the F.U. line.  Okay.  Hey, thanks for calling, and here's the Opie and Anthony F.U. line. 
[01:30:30]  I just want to give a big F.U. to all you Chicago Bears fans, because the Philadelphia Eagles  are going to come up to Chicago and whoop your Fog Bowl asses.  F.U.  We're going to kick your ass all the way into the conference, J.B.  and Simpson.  Next message.  This F.U. goes out to Craig in Buffalo, New York.  F.U.  You, Craig.  Guess what?  I'm still sleeping with Dean.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Next message.  Hey, this is Bobby Bigger.  My F.U.  goes out to that homo douchebag driving that blue minivan coming off the Tavernsley Bridge 
[01:31:00]  that decided to come up next to me, yanking his bag, and offer an oral treat.  What do I look like, Norton?  Well, let me tell you something, homo.  I hope you're out of the closet, because by the time I download my camera, put them pictures  on the Internet, you will be.  Have a nice day, Peggy.  End of message.  Some days, you know, we're a laugh riot, and other days we just flat out suck.  We know it.  Interesting and true.  O.P.  and M.P.  and E.W. 
[01:31:30]  Oh, Jim's back.  Hi, Jim.  Hi, boy.  We're back with the O&A Show.  Hanging out and finding out how nice they are out there.  Where are you, Jim?  That's all right.  It's very cool.  Oh, they're nice.  It's very cool.  I'm so glad we have a radio show to get you laid.  That's what Jimmy's doing.  Don't mistake that.  I'm not going to get laid.  Don't mistake that.  Yeah, please.  Trippers never bang me.  Not called getting laid when it's rape.  I'm walking.  Well, I may argue that with you. 
[01:32:00]  Are they on?  You're on, Adam.  I didn't have your mic on at first.  Doug, what's up?  Yeah, you guys suck.  Thank you.  I really wish we could have been able to see that.  You didn't see the stinky cam?  You didn't miss much.  Yeah, but you didn't tell them that you were doing it, so I was trying to play along.  Oh, I see.  Did you see the stinky cam?  Wow, that was horrible.  Yeah, and Norm's got some fat hands.  They were just all over the girl, I know. 
[01:32:30]  No, when they were on the couch, there was some good stuff going on there.  Yeah, I was trying to help you guys out there.  The one girl didn't want to take off her bar because of, like, you know, the thing.  The time.  Yeah, which is, but the...  And the Saudi Arabia chick, she ran for the hills.  Yeah, it was...  Apparently, she has nothing to do with the other two girls.  The ab looking one?  Yeah.  Moolah stripper?  Yeah.  And she wants no part of the other girls.  Yeah. 
[01:33:00]  All right.  Thank you, Doug.  Nice.  Nice.  That's blue man.  All right.  Are they finally getting out of here?  Rick, are they done?  That's it, right?  Yeah.  That's all we need.  That's nice.  I mean, I think...  Do you need to say goodbye to them, Jim?  No, not at all.  Just get a number or something?  Did you see how it got started?  What's the matter?  The other two girls are getting mad at him now.  Why?  Mad at who?  That little short guy down there yelling at him, too.  About?  About what we discussed during the break.  Okay, look.  Bring the girls and the little guy in here. 
[01:33:30]  We'll get to the bottom of this.  There's some kind of scandal going on.  What is going on?  During a commercial I walk by, I swear I heard Norton go,  so you do hooker rug and string art.  This is going to be hard because I'm actually going to have to have them talk.  I'm into crafts.  Okay.  All right.  Here, the little one.  Here, get on that mic.  Everyone else is dressed on me by now.  Now, what...  What is going on?  What seems to be the confusion?  Yeah, you guys were yelling at... 
[01:34:00]  There's some confusion that happened, Mr. Pimp Guy.  What happened?  Mr. Pimp Guy made us think that we were here just to promote LipstickLessies.com.  Right.  Hey, cool.  Yeah, see, I'm saying the name for you.  There you go.  So, that's what we were here.  We thought that he was kind of associated with you guys in some way to promote it.  How was that...  That's why the confusion...  How did you get that confusion?  I write for Foundry.  I do a column for Foundry.  All right.  Steve's fault.  Steve's fault. 
[01:34:30]  Steve's fault.  All right.  Steve from FoundryMusic.com.  So, we thought...  We thought...  Wait, you don't even...  Hold on.  You don't even know this guy?  We thought...  Yeah, we've met him a couple of times, but for no one well, no.  We'll have to be back.  Yeah, right.  So, we thought...  What did he tell you?  All of you guys.  Hold on.  What did he tell you?  The lipstick lesbian competition you're having?  We thought we were just...  We thought we were girls coming in here speaking on behalf with you guys about the website.  That's what we thought.  Why on behalf of us? 
[01:35:00]  What did you...  I don't know.  We just said there's a lipstick lesbian competition where you got a hundred grand.  What?  A hundred grand.  Who's got a hundred grand?  Well, we thought we did.  We thought you guys did.  That's how we're on the show.  That's the problem.  That's why we're here.  Erin, I never said to you that it was an Opie and Anthony.  I said that we're trying to get Opie and Anthony...  Don't argue with me on the air.  I'm on to this conference.  Do not argue with me right now.  We'll talk about it later.  Say again.  Just a little mix-up.  This is good radio.  This is good radio.  That's where the mix-up came from.  That's where the...  Well, you're carried away.  Well, listen.  I got...  Look, I know... 
[01:35:30]  I feel bad because some people sort of mis...  I miscommunicated.  I feel like I'm in the shed house.  You're talking about Bunch or Stripper.  I feel like I'm getting whipped in the shed or something here.  But to...  Oh, my God.  Amy of the real wife.com.  I'm only saying that just so we all know exactly who she is.  She's out there.  And when I approached her and her husband...  She's out there.  They must...  I told them that I write for Foundry Music, which is the column...  Look at that.  Every time you say that, Steve, it just gets like...  Somehow...  Dude, you say that one more time.  I'm punching you across the studio.  You officially no longer write for my website. 
[01:36:00]  Oh, wow.  I don't know who you are.  Wow.  I don't...  I've never met this guy before.  He just immediately just introduced himself as somebody who writes for my site.  A lot of them, I have to admit, I've never seen before.  Okay.  But this guy went out and represented himself as part of this program, apparently.  That's what it sounds like.  And falsified a lot of information.  And I don't want any part of him.  I'm sorry.  Wow.  Steve, Steve.  That's not what you said to me five minutes ago when I told you that I never said I... 
[01:36:30]  Because you just said one thing different.  You just said something completely different now than you said five minutes ago.  What did I say different?  You just said you represented this radio show and that thing.  I said I write for Foundry Music, which is the site of filming it with Opie and Anthony.  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on.  It's not filming it.  Ladies, ladies, ladies.  Hold on.  Hold on.  All right, Rick, yes.  Because I'm hearing a different story from this guy.  Who's that guy?  This is...  He's with Amy.  Okay.  Are you married to...  All right.  Now, what story...  I'm Amy's husband.  I was contacted by Joe via email who stated I work for Opie and Anthony, was sponsoring a contest 
[01:37:00]  called...  Shut up, Joe.  So, Luscious Lipstick Lesbians is a $100,000 prize and it ends in June.  Who's got the $100,000?  Who's got the $100,000?  Who has it?  The company that's doing the contest.  Who's the company?  What company?  The company.  It's called House of Stafford Productions.  Who?  Yeah, and it's being done by sponsors.  I mean, you know how these websites work.  Some of these porn sites.  A prize.  We're not having the money in place.  Oh, boy.  Where is it?  Some of this might be by Mitzel money and...  No, no, no. 
[01:37:30]  It's...  No.  Of course, I'm kidding.  It's some sponsors of the website.  Dude, do you have the email?  Yes.  I'll follow you with the email.  All right.  Look, look.  Look, Rick.  That guy looks really pissed.  The husband looks pissed.  Listen up.  Listen up quickly for a minute, everybody.  Rick, take him out to the computer.  Can you punch up your email right now?  Yes.  Now, I have it saved in a file in my laptop.  I can't pull it up over here.  Oh, damn it.  What I can do is I can...  You erased it from your email account.  No, no.  I have it, but I can copy and download and send it to your filing cabinet.  Because I want it now. 
[01:38:00]  Right.  I want it now.  Did you, at some point in an email, say that you work for this program?  That's what you mean.  My email, what it says, I know, because I have it up on my site also.  I have a copy of the email.  I write for...  Yeah, you can see it.  What's that?  Lipsticklessies.com.  He's going to say it again, Steve.  What?  All right, can I use a euphemism here?  I said I write for the site affiliated with the show.  Go to Lipsticklessies.com backslash amateurbulletin.htm. 
[01:38:30]  How come nobody understood you, Leo?  No, we didn't.  Thanks.  Because people...  You know why?  Because people hear what they want to hear.  When they hear Opie and Anthony, automatically...  No, that's funny, because I'm from California.  I don't know anything about Opie and Anthony.  There you go.  Sorry, I don't know anything about Opie and Anthony.  She knows more about what's in Norton's underwear right now than she knows about this program.  So I just came in.  What about the ratings in Chicago?  I want to know what this girl was told.  Yeah.  I was...  So I...  What I thought... 
[01:39:00]  I'm not...  You know, I'm not gullible.  I was promised a pony.  I was promised...  They promised you the pony, too?  So what were you...  Now, let me...  What were you under the impression of?  We thought that he worked for you guys.  Okay.  Somehow they thought that.  So that's the problem.  And then you thought you were...  Somehow...  You thought you were coming up here.  There you go.  All right, read it.  Thank you, guys.  Read it up.  To promote it.  All right, hold on.  Read that.  All right, from the top, I guess?  All right. 
[01:39:30]  It says, want to make your site a household word?  Household word?  I'm a writer for the Opie and Anthony radio show's website, FoundryMusic.com.  I also run this site, which promotes the world's most luscious lipstick lesbian contest.  The contest is also open to bisexuals.  Opie and Anthony adore hot lesbians and bisexuals, and I conceived the contest with them in mind.  I'm looking to team up with two or three amateur models or adult performers in a way that leverages my ties to Opie and Anthony for all our gain.  Okay.  Oh, my God. 
[01:40:00]  He has the incriminating language.  So give us a break.  We were misled.  Well, it's not misleading.  I think the girls got a bad rap, to be honest.  Hold on.  I have no problem with the two lovely blondes.  I know that, but everybody yelled at me for defending them.  All I know is an hour and a half ago, when we attempted to start a radio show, we still haven't started it.  We knew something was wrong with the whole situation.  I tried to put together something entertaining for the show.  All I tried to do.  Hold on.  Another line.  All right.  I need girls to serve as the spokesmodels for the contest. 
[01:40:30]  Basically, you would go on Opie and Anthony whenever possible and plug the contest and your site.  Yeah.  Now, no one, no one spoke to us about this.  You put that on a site stating that, girls, come on there.  We'll go on Opie and Anthony when we can.  No, no, no, it's not what it says.  It makes it sound like you had spoken to us about this.  No, I sent Rick.  Rick and I have been exchanging.  Oh, now Rick's getting involved. 
[01:41:00]  No, no, no, Joe.  Don't try and bury me with this.  You sent me one email.  Let me tell you something.  You sent me one email with some pictures.  Abuse Rick?  Yeah.  No, no.  Rick's not right this time.  That's a worm.  You sent me one picture with three.  That's a worm.  Rick's going to beat him up watching.  This guy sent me one.  My inauguration is on the show.  One.  No, no, no.  There is no inauguration.  This is your exit from the show, believe me.  This is your exile.  This is no inauguration.  This guy sent me one email, one email that got my interest up, which was three pictures, 
[01:41:30]  which I thought, okay, these girls are hot.  If he's going to bring these in, we can do something with this.  Then he sent another picture of another girl.  I'm like, all right, he's got four hot girls here.  Not a problem.  I think we can work with this.  Like Ted Bundy.  Here's my inauguration of the gas chamber.  Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick.  Hold on.  And then he starts talking about a contest.  I'm like, dude, I don't care about your contest, to be quite honest with you.  I need these girls in here to perform.  No problem, he says.  When can we do it?  I'm like, fine. 
[01:42:00]  We need some chicks for Friday.  All right.  No, Rick.  That was it.  Okay, let's listen to the girl.  Before we gave him the pictures that he emailed to you, the pictures of myself and Davida,  before those pictures got to you, he told us that he was coming on the opening anthony show  and everything, before you ever got the pictures.  Before you got those pictures.  Because I gave him.  No, you did not.  Do not lie in my face.  Because I am not.  I'm not married.  Erin, the night we spoke at the club, how drunk were you when I told you all this?  You know what?  Drunk is coming.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Sorry. 
[01:42:30]  Sorry.  Sorry.  I said we'd go on the show.  I'm so on fire right now.  These guys are having fun, I think.  No.  Why is it wrong?  We're only having six.  This is the worst show we've done in weeks.  This is so ridiculous.  I've never been so turned on on the radio, though.  There you go.  I like Erin.  Okay.  I like Erin.  I like Erin.  He talks about scores, and then he goes, the results scores have reaped tens of millions  of dollars in free advertising, and it is the must-see spot for countless businessmen.  I intend to forge a similar relationship with Opie and Anthony.  Well, some dreams die hard.  And models I'm promoting to reap tremendous rewards. 
[01:43:00]  Anytime somebody writes forge, they're lying.  Oh, man.  Guys, look.  I adore you guys.  You've got a great show.  You have this tremendous need for hot women to come on the show.  I don't know.  I'm having a great time with you guys.  Are you guys disappointed?  No, I'm having a great time with you guys.  The husband wants to beat them up.  I know that much.  I expected to be the host of a lipstick lesbian competition where I'd be passing out $100,000  in prizes to hot lipstick lesbian.  That's what I heard.  Wait, are you on the wrong radio program? 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, I thought we had a budget for that already.  Yeah, look at us.  It looks like we have $100,000.  $100,000.  Guys, we're having a great time with you guys.  We can't even get a DVD player to give away.  Opie Hudla Hudla's checking in and says, the problem is the email must have had AP on it  so everyone believed it as being true.  They thought they were kind of representing Opie and Anthony while working with Opie and  Anthony in a contest.  She thought she was giving them away $100,000.  Yeah, that's what I thought.  That's why we didn't come in here throwing on a show.  I know exactly what happened.  This guy talked some stuff up so much to get girls involved with any of these ventures that 
[01:44:00]  you might have, whether it's web things or strip clubs or whatever it is.  So you're, you know, when you get to talking to these girls or other people, you're like,  hey, you throw around the O&A show, you throw around this side of the other thing, and then  all of a sudden it gets interpreted as being a little different.  So we're just dancing.  We dance at VIP club.  You dance at VIP, right?  VIP club.  So this guy goes to the strip clubs and trolls the girls and talks to them.  Throwing out the show name as Chum. 
[01:44:30]  Bring hot women onto this show.  He does that.  He creates like high school stuff with a van with a little Bugs Bunny sticker on it.  Sir, you're a livery-lipped little man.  What is wrong with bringing hot women onto this show to have fun?  Let's talk to the husband and wife team.  All right, let's talk to these two.  Hold on, hold on, because this guy's going to beat up somebody soon.  He's a big boy, too, though.  Yes.  Turn him upside down and shake his bar mitzvah money out of him.  Right.  You better leave after the show, Joe, and I'll tell you that much.  Oh.  Don't say two words to me, Joe. 
[01:45:00]  I promise to get people on the show.  So what were you expecting from today?  Joe presented to us that he was affiliated with O&A.  Okay.  There's a $100,000 contest.  Amy could promote his site, therealwife.com, and you're going to get tons of traffic, etc., etc.  Which you will, by the way.  You will, definitely.  I appreciate it.  Thank you, but we're having a great time, but it's the fact that you don't mislead people.  You just say the truth.  Right.  There's no need to lie to people or make BS stories up.  Just be honest with people, and that's it.  See, we have you who has one story, and then we have everyone else telling what they heard 
[01:45:30]  from you with the same different story.  I'll give you a ride.  My goal was to get a couple of hot girls onto this show, to promote this contest that I'm  involved with.  And O.J.'s goal, just not to have to deal with his ex-wife anymore.  And to provide some hot women for you guys.  And here I am.  Is there $100,000 somewhere?  No, no.  This guy is trying to ban you.  Hold on.  The wife wants to say something. 
[01:46:00]  Opie and Anthony, you know what?  Honestly, we can just take Joe away, okay?  The hot girls are here, and just cut Joe out, and we'll have fun directly with you guys.  But now, we're on a real basis.  I like that.  So, the girls from VIP, and myself, Amy, from the real life of the top are here.  Take your bar mitzvah money and tell your story walking.  That's right.  As long as I bring a smile to you on a real basis.  He looks like he might be a pimp, though.  No, no.  Are you going to get me down?  This guy is enough of a loser. 
[01:46:30]  He goes into the strip show.  He goes, oh, yeah, I work there.  I work there.  You don't do that.  You tissue?  I said that, man.  I never said that, man.  I never said that.  Look at the freaking emails.  I never said that.  Barry looks very British.  It's not even British.  It's not even...  Wait a minute.  Go ahead, Nigel.  Tell him this little prick out now.  Steve.  Uh-oh.  Steve's throwing you out.  And not in a nice way.  Oh, yeah.  Steve.  Steve.  Steve just threw him. 
[01:47:00]  I wonder why Steve's so pissed.  Just because he had some...  You know why?  Some affiliation with...  Yeah, he kept...  He's talking up a writer for Foundry.  Writer for Foundry.  What is that?  Get a mic out there.  Girls, you've got to be quiet so we can hear that.  No, Joe.  Wow, there's some pissed off people out there.  What's going on?  Rick, what's going on out there?  What happened, Matt?  He's just a dickhead.  He really is.  This guy is a loser.  Oh, my God.  He comes in.  He's talking to me, hey, guys. 
[01:47:30]  I work at the show.  He's worse than Mark, you know?  So, now, hopefully everyone understands.  Well, now, we knew something was up.  Yeah, yeah.  Something wasn't right.  Wait a minute, now.  There was something not right.  It seems like somebody owes Jim Norton an apology for...  Shut up.  Shut up, Jim.  I should have never got to this point.  Yeah.  No, you know what, guys?  Honestly...  I like this one.  Speaking for myself, I'd like to honestly really apologize.  No, you guys are totally misled.  Oh, no, no.  We were totally misled. 
[01:48:00]  As a matter of fact, he was supposed to publish a so-called interview with me, and you guys  were supposed to air it.  The whole interview in full.  Are you kidding?  Wait, wait, wait.  What?  What?  He was supposed to do an interview with me.  Do an interview.  Can I go online?  Maybe I can pull the email up?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Do that.  Rick, show him the computer.  Try to pull the email up.  He told you that he was going to do an interview with you, and it was going to air in its entirety  on this broadcast.  You guys were supposed to talk about the whole thing, exactly.  Yeah, he told me that you had approved that I was going to be the co-host for the lipstick 
[01:48:30]  last year in the competition on your show, and that you were giving out a hundred grand.  He's trying to ban you, girl.  He's trying to ban you dancers.  That's what he's doing.  Are you talking to yourself?  No.  I know they won't sleep with me.  No way.  He's a weasel.  That's hilarious.  Somebody promised him a date with Ben.  Look at Norton.  Does anyone notice that Norton has a beautiful girl on his lap and is hugging him and just...  You got something out of this one.  I like Norton's lap.  Norton's the only winner. 
[01:49:00]  You are the only winner.  Everyone else has been misled.  Oh.  But I deserve it because I was in the right here.  I saw that something was not right, and I stuck by the ladies.  Right.  And all of a sudden, now, no one's giving me my props, as it were.  You're getting props, all right.  Yeah.  All right, Norton.  Props and drops.  Looks like things are turning for the better, finally.  Oh, I hope so.  I think we could even start our radio show.  I don't think anything else could go wrong today, right?  I knew something was amiss here.  There's no way anything else could go wrong today, right, Anthony? 
[01:49:30]  Let's go.  Oh, no.  Oh, Christ.  How are you guys doing?  Hi, Anthony.  What is this?  What is wrong with today?  I didn't know you.  I'm freaking water.  I'm here for the contest.  I've never actually had an erection I wanted to throw up at the same time.  I don't want to hear about throwing up, please.  Why?  What's wrong?  I was sick for two days.  Maybe it's your mullet.  No.  I don't have a mullet.  You certainly do.  At least I have hair.  At least I have hair.  Where's yours?  Hi, Opie. 
[01:50:00]  How you doing?  Hey, how you guys been?  Oh, my God.  Just when you thought it couldn't get anywhere.  It's getting anywhere.  What's the matter?  You guys miss us.  I'm here for the luscious lesbian lipstick contest.  You guys miss us.  Where are you?  I'm trying to win $100,000.  Oh, my God.  Look, the housewife is horrified.  Yeah.  The housewife is a housewife.  Look at Norton.  All right.  We also came by to tell you guys something.  Uh-oh.  You getting married?  No.  You and Lady Guy? 
[01:50:30]  Oh, no.  No.  No, we're not.  Diane is turning over a new leaf.  What's that?  That's right.  She just went with me last night to join a house club.  She is going to start working out.  I thought you were going to say AA.  AA.  No, a house club.  A house club.  I'm going to help myself.  Now, wait a minute.  You've been working out at this club?  Yes, we are.  I'm going to start.  Probably Monday.  Oh, so you both joined a club at the same time.  Yes, we did.  And you're going to be going.  Three days a week.  Dude, forget about.  It's about the same time.  Forget Stalker Patty Cribs.  Stalker Patty Cribs. 
[01:51:00]  I want to see these two at the gym.  Sure.  Sure.  Why not?  We'll take pictures.  Do you guys get to Jersey?  We need Steve C. to go with a camera and videotape what your one workout is.  We start.  We don't have a problem with that.  All right.  We'll schedule that all out.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  We have to go.  You've got a handful of ass there, Jim.  We have to go for orientation on Thursday.  Orientation?  Yeah.  I've got to go get a workout suit.  It's wet pants and a t-shirt.  All right.  Look, we've got to take a break.  All right.  I sleep in my sport pants.  I can't.  She's just what I thought. 
[01:51:30]  If I can get to see Frodo on a treadmill.  What?  Well, what about me on a treadmill?  I've been on a treadmill before.  I've been on a treadmill before.  I've been on a treadmill.  I've been on a bike.  I've lifted.  I've got weights at home.  I walk around weights.  Jim is paying no attention to this show.  He's carrying on conversations with the girls.  That's how you know I'm horny.  I don't even know there's two buffalo just walked into the room.  Jim, this is a...  We don't look like buffalo.  We don't look like buffalo.  And let me tell you.  Jim's acting like this is a blog.  Oh, my God. 
[01:52:00]  That's right.  Look what's going on.  We just joined a health club.  See, ladies, this is what...  And we're going to start working out.  This is what real ladies do over here.  Forget that website.  Forget that website.  That's what real ladies do?  Yeah.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Yeah.  How about that?  We might not look like that, but we won't look like that.  Holy ass.  Wow.  It's never too late.  It's never too late.  All right.  It's never too late.  Now, I'm going to do the best I can.  Why did you guys stop by today?  It felt like it. 
[01:52:30]  We haven't seen you guys since before Christmas.  Yeah, we stopped by to say hi.  Do you want a beer?  We stopped by to visit.  Yeah, did somebody promise you that they were hosting a fattest pig contest for a hundred  grand?  No, no.  It would be nice.  I thought you were going to be at the stress factory tonight.  What's the stress factory?  I'm going to stress me somewhere tonight.  I'm going to stress me somewhere tonight.  You sound like Voss after dental surgery.  Hey, Rich Voss is nice.  Don't talk about Rich Voss like that.  Hey, Jim, I really thought you were going to be doing a show tonight somewhere.  Look at how quick...  Oh, God. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah, they jump out of that word.  You know where the bathroom is?  I mean, you could always go do this.  All right.  All right, Mary.  Relax.  You...  Oh, boy.  I'll admit it.  We've lost control of this show today.  It's Friday.  What the hell?  I thought it was going to be a good day.  I wasn't mean.  Lady Di, you want a beer?  No, I don't.  Why not?  No.  Come on.  Have a good beer.  Anthony, I got something I want to tell you.  I'll take water.  After Christmas party, I did not speak to her for two weeks.  Yeah, she was mad at me.  She kept calling my husband, told my husband, tell Diana I ain't home. 
[01:53:30]  I don't want to talk to her.  Leave me alone.  Whoa.  I was mad for two whole weeks.  Good thing.  He was.  Because you don't want to know what happened after we left the bar.  What happened?  Oh, what happened?  Let me know.  Let me know.  What happened?  We took a cab.  Right.  Right.  Okay.  We held the cab.  Uh-huh.  That was, no.  Hey.  That was one.  Hey.  Big fly, Lady Di.  That was one.  Got to get some good radio idea.  Yeah.  And what happened?  Right.  That was two.  We get in Penn Station.  Right.  Yeah.  I was, she starts arguing with me, fighting with me, yelling at me, cursing at me. 
[01:54:00]  I walked over and I told an Amtrak cop, can I do something with her?  Right.  He told me, take her down at Dunkin' Donuts, get her coffee.  Which I did.  She's fighting with me at Dunkin' Donuts.  I left for Dunkin' Donuts.  She almost picked somebody up, some, who knows what.  A homeless guy or something?  Yeah, I didn't leave her in the city all night.  Really?  We were fighting on the train.  Picking up drunks at Penn Station.  That's a catch. 
[01:54:30]  Wait, you left her in the city?  No.  No, no, no.  No.  She made sure that I got home.  She made sure I got home.  The thing is, though, is just that, in a cab, what did I do?  What did I do?  She pushed her in front of the train.  What did I do?  You know what I mean?  No.  That would have derailed the train.  I was trying to have a good time.  No, she knows.  I was trying to have a good time, which I didn't drink much.  Train injured as it hits a person on the train.  I was having a good time.  It was a lot of fun until she just completely ruined everyone's night.  I didn't know what she did.  It was my guy on stage. 
[01:55:00]  It took her by her night.  You're absolutely right.  You wrecked everyone's night at Bar 9 a few weeks ago.  I didn't rip anybody's night.  You wrecked everyone's night.  We like Marion.  I'm sorry.  You were like a roving pain in the ass.  I'm sorry, Anthony.  Walking around.  A randomly annoying everybody.  And you couldn't be more atrociously dressed than you are right now.  What is that?  That is awful.  How are you ever going to find a new man with that?  She's got a Stinky Rolls t-shirt.  Look at that jacket.  She's got a Stinky Rolls t-shirt.  She's got the bling bling.  She's got her papers in the mail today. 
[01:55:30]  She's changing her back to her maiden name.  Her junior high school jacket.  What is that thing?  A high school jacket?  What is that?  It looks like it came out of a Michael Jackson video.  It's not a car race.  It's a Kmart jacket.  Remember I got this at Kmart?  No wonder they're belly in up.  A mafia white jacket.  It's something to keep me warm.  Oh.  That's what it is.  Right?  It's a T-shirt.  Why do you need that to keep you warm?  The 1,400 extra pounds aren't doing it?  Jam.  Would you sell your pelt? 
[01:56:00]  Sell my what?  Nothing.  She sheds in the winter.  Yeah, that must be it.  Oh, boy.  All right.  So how have you guys been?  Pretty good?  Fantastic.  Right up until Thursday.  Today.  Today's a little different.  Where do the hot girls go?  They're outside.  Your one is here still.  One out of three is in bed.  So I wanted to ask you guys something.  What would you guys say?  What would you guys say?  If me and her did come back here whenever, you know, I'll say next month.  We might come back next month, right before my birthday. 
[01:56:30]  Right.  But if we ended up like 70 pounds lighter, what would you say?  I'd ask who gave you AIDS.  You probably would.  You went to a health club, Jim.  $30 a month.  And if you were down 70 pounds, I'd probably say, how does it feel to be 380?  No.  No.  I'm not even close to 200 pounds.  You will be if you drop 70 by 1.  I will tell you.  Wow, Jim.  I know.  Let me tell you.  Hey, John, what's up?  John.  You know what?  No, really. 
[01:57:00]  I'm not even 200 pounds.  All right.  Shut up for a sec.  John.  Shut up.  Why?  John.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Oh, my God.  These girls even sound like they're fat.  Holy Christ.  We're not that fat.  We're not fat.  What are you?  You sound like you're retarded.  Here come the comebacks.  I love them.  I love the Marion comebacks.  You're like, I don't even know what you're talking about.  Well, I wish there was a way to describe the shirt you're wearing.  It is.  What's got it?  It's everything.  It's hot.  And it has a collar. 
[01:57:30]  That is.  It looks like a Colorado scene.  It's cold outside.  Yeah, she's got like a winter bridge over a river scene going on.  And the bridge is actual sun.  That is a Bob Ross painting on her shirt.  That's something you see.  It's a comfortable shirt.  That's something you see on the side of a van.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Well, we're going to put a happy little tree right here on that tremendous gut.  All right.  Let me go.  It's your world, people.  I like it.  I like the way it fits me.  It's your world.  You put it right here.  And we're going to make some waves in the lake right about where her nipples, her nips go. 
[01:58:00]  That's right about knee level.  That's right.  What's wrong?  I know, and I'm losing some of it up here, too.  All right.  Rich Voss, what's up?  Hey, hey, hey.  When Norton was trashing me, which one of those mongoloids stuck up for me?  Me.  That was me.  I stuck in.  I am, Rich.  Don't ever stick up for me.  Lady guys, I love you.  Listen to me.  Listen to me.  Don't ever pretend I'm nice, okay?  If you were drowning, I would walk by laughing, okay?  I love you.  Good.  Good.  Listen to me.  Don't stick up for me.  If my fiancee Norton wants to trash me, he can, okay? 
[01:58:30]  I don't need you to.  Oh, my God.  All right.  It's Friday.  I was like, what's that?  We know.  It's yin-yang party time.  Oh, yin-yang party.  Oh, God.  Their catchphrase.  I can't even tell you what I was doing in bed, and I had to stop.  Thank you.  Hey, I hope you were having fun.  Why?  Did the other guy get disgusted?  Isn't that small, boss?  That was good.  That's good.  Wow.  Look at that.  Oh, man.  Hey, you know what?  Hey, Anthony.  Yeah?  The other day.  Now, I don't have cable at home. 
[01:59:00]  I have cable here.  Yeah.  And I did see Oz, like you were talking about.  Oh, yeah.  It was unbelievable.  Listen, at the end of the scene, this guy was sitting in solitary naked.  Is that what you're talking about?  It's the guy from Biohazard.  Yeah.  I've been from Biohazard.  I looked.  I went, oh, my God, right?  But then I had to look again.  Yeah, faggot.  I know.  It was unbelievable.  Anyhow, look.  I just called and say, people in Cleveland, they are picking up these stickers.  They're going out.  It's unbelievable.  Hard work.  What are they supposed to do when there's a man just standing there handing them out? 
[01:59:30]  They're going to take them.  Yeah, well, what do you expect?  You've got to get them out there, right?  Yes.  Boss, you're still in Cleveland?  Yeah.  All right, good.  You're playing tonight?  Yeah.  It's not like, I just, you know, I'm giving the stickers out.  It's fun.  I'm having a good time out here.  You should plug your gig in Cleveland.  Hey, boss, when are you going back to Caroline's?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, we want to see you.  We want to see you at Caroline's.  They don't take whip checks.  Oh, Jesus.  I'm a deal for it, including right now.  I can't take all of you.  Nobody's there in February, either.  Oh, God.  Words whipping around the teeth like a labyrinth. 
[02:00:00]  They can't find their way.  Hey, you know what?  Hey, I was on, like, some early morning radio yesterday.  It's, like, the number one radio station in Cleveland.  Yeah.  And I kind of, like, got kicked off because I go to the guys.  I go, so do you guys listen to Opie and Anthony?  They threw you off?  Well, not really.  No, he promised a lesbian contest with $100,000.  No, I know Opie and Anthony.  Look, I got the stickers.  I'm affiliated with the show.  I got the stickers in my form. 
[02:00:30]  It's for money.  Yeah.  Get the lesbians.  We'll give them a Ross Apollo first.  All right, boss.  All right, well, listen.  Come here, Pop.  Get some stickers.  I'll talk to you guys later.  All right.  Have fun in Cleveland.  Thanks.  Take care, Rich.  Bye, Rich.  He's still in Cleveland?  Yeah.  New York won't let him back, huh?  You know what happened.  There's nobody at Caroline's.  My neighbor Mario can't tell him.  I was hoping to see him for my birthday.  I was hoping to see him, too.  I was hoping to see him, too.  Everything she says.  Everything she says.  You've got to chime in. 
[02:01:00]  Do you have your own thoughts, Lady Di?  Yes, I do.  Yeah, when he says the mullet.  What about my hair?  What about me?  Oh, that's a nice shirt, Marion.  What about my shirt?  I didn't say that.  What about me?  What about me, me, me, me?  Ah, your hair is awful.  Yeah, there.  It's a stringy, awful mess.  What are you supposed to do with my hair?  I don't know.  Just do something with it.  I have nothing funny to say.  How about combing?  Do something with mine, then.  Yeah, shampoo.  How about washing?  It's not about you, douchebag. 
[02:01:30]  All right.  God.  There we go.  Okay, we're going to...  Shampoo.  We're going to take a break, Ann, and we're going to see where we're at when we come back.  All right.  We've got to enter a contest when we're, like, down a little bit.  At least me, I do.  You really have great expectations within this work.  Yes, I do.  Yeah, I put on a drink.  You've got to change your diet.  You've got to stop drinking booze.  Just so you know, it's a treadmill.  It's not a wand.  I don't drink.  I do not drink.  I can have four or five beers.  He'll tell you.  I can have four or five beers, and I'm finished. 
[02:02:00]  Then, lady, die.  You'll continue drinking and getting into your drunken stupers.  No, not the way I was.  No.  Not the way you are.  It's been home at my closet for Christmas.  Don't you understand?  You're not the type of person that could just have a couple.  You start drinking, it's all over.  You get obnoxious so quick.  I could have maybe two or something like that, but that's just about it.  Give her the benefit of the doubt, because it may be a matter of that day, and me still  framing it into her.  Who was she trying to pick up at the train station?  Somebody in Dunkin' Donuts. 
[02:02:30]  I left her with the guy.  Dunkin' Donuts?  At what time?  Dunkin' Donuts, Penn Station, three in the morning.  Wow.  You were going to go with him because you said to me, my friend thinks I'm drunk, but I'm  not.  I said, fine.  I said, F you.  Go with him.  I said, fine.  You only should watch the jersey.  Then we went back out again and went on the train, and she took me home.  That was it.  We were arguing on a train, and we had other people butting in on an argument.  Marion, why don't you just give up on your friendship with Lady Di?  We were friends since we were kids. 
[02:03:00]  Ding-ing party days.  We've been a lot together.  And you know, sometimes when you're out trying to have fun, she gets a little carried away.  And at night, she wasn't celebrating.  I'm not going to do that anymore.  She was celebrating her divorce, and everything hit her all at once.  Sometimes it happens.  I can only imagine how much the husband was celebrating.  I don't even know.  Oh, it's probably...  Free left!  Free left!  Haven't gotten in touch with him.  Look at what Norton's doing right now.  Picture that, because that's your husband celebrating.  Without the bum.  All right.  Can we get back to the hot lesbians? 
[02:03:30]  Now he ain't, but back then he was.  Nah, he's all right.  I'm just better off that, and that's all.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Wow.  What?  Nothing.  The Opie and Anthony F.U. line is there for you when life sucks.  Sucks to be me.  Call anytime.  212-830-3785.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's Friday!  Friday! 
[02:04:00]  Friday!  Ah!  Wack, wack, wack, wack, wack!  Girls putting their clothes on all over the place here, Ant.  The Naughty Nighty Contest continues.  One of the girls, the housewife?  Yeah.  She has entered the Naughty Nighty Contest.  Ah, there you go.  Her pictures are up on opianthony.com.  Something came out of this.  Or foundrymusic.com. 
[02:04:30]  Can we come back tomorrow and do this?  Huh?  What?  You got to talk into a mic.  Can we come back tomorrow and ask for you?  I didn't know about the Naughty Contest until I got here today.  Come back next week.  You know the Naughty Contest?  You win a half a million dollars.  Right.  Some little worm will...  Tomorrow's Saturday.  There's no show.  Yeah, right.  Like, Tuesday.  Craig, what's going on?  Dude, your show is blowing today.  The only thing we're doing your show today in the Titanic is the Titanic had a band.  Yeah.  The luckiest guy on earth right now is the guy you threw out of the studio. 
[02:05:00]  And you could have saved it because you had a bunch of broads in there.  And then you let the Mongoloid twins in.  And they're just kidding me.  They're kidding me.  What's going on today?  I didn't think they were going to show up.  I don't know why they show up.  You have like an hour to redeem yourself.  And then I'm going to start...  I don't know what I'm going to do.  I'm going to listen to, like, Enya or something.  I'm sure if Norton had some place to go, he'd leave.  No, do I do it at 8 o'clock.  Where are you...  Are you playing somewhere tonight?  Stress factor.  Yeah, I think it's sold out, but it's a stress factor. 
[02:05:30]  Norton completely wrecks our show, and then he's going to leave early on top of the year.  How did I wreck the show?  I was technically right about the girl.  The vibe was right.  I was right.  They were very cool.  It wasn't...  There was something wrong.  It took two hours to get something going here with the whole thing.  But, dude, I didn't know all the whole mix-up and all of the telling tall tales.  Right.  I think it's all over, but the shout now.  Everyone's pointing fingers.  It just, you know, sometimes it goes bad.  I did know, though.  Yeah, you did.  I'll give you that, but...  All right.  You're like a cop with a hunch.  Yeah, exactly. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  I have a hunch.  All right, Craig.  Thank you.  All right.  Later.  Bye.  The married young lady is back.  It's wonderful.  Woo-hoo!  Oh, well, three of us are here.  Heather.  Hello.  Hi, Heather.  What's up?  Hey.  I just want to know if Marianne, the retards, actually went to school and have a good idea  for a contest.  Maybe get an elocution or speech teacher to actually teach them how to speak.  Don't worry about the weight.  I think these two have to rely on their minds as opposed to their looks. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  You should hear them, though, now.  They're talking about going to the gym and working out and how good they're going to look.  They need to learn how to speak.  Yeah.  Because I was wondering where the C in the picture went because they said you can take  pictures of them.  Marianne, what a contrast in scenes this is.  Heather.  Wow.  Heather.  Heather.  Heather.  What?  Wow.  I'm stuttering.  Heather is making fun of your speech pattern.  Why?  Why?  With it. 
[02:07:00]  Wow.  We.  Shut up.  I'm just watching some lesbo action over here.  Lady Di, what do you think of that?  That's hot, right?  Hot.  It looks hot.  It looks hot.  Like my cup of tea.  How are you?  I prefer the gears grinding in a Kenworth.  You don't want to talk about it.  Look at that.  How are you?  How are you?  There's a guy in there.  Hey, how are you, lesbians?  Her husband wasn't so big.  God, is she sexy.  How do you know? 
[02:07:30]  Why do you laugh?  Oh, you mean there's a guy in there.  You're all set.  Diane.  Yes.  If you wanted to.  Yeah, jump in then, Di.  A peep show, you would see exactly what you're looking at now.  There's three girls.  There's three girls.  Why don't you jump in and make it an eightsome?  No, that's okay.  Because we're not into that.  These girls are always horned up.  Oh, I know.  They're looking.  Why don't you jump in?  All titillated.  What's wrong with looking?  Not wrong with looking.  You go to the peep show still?  Not wrong with looking.  No, but I just said to her because she's looking and laughing. 
[02:08:00]  Nice.  Oh, yeah.  Well, one time.  Yeah.  If you went last month, yeah.  You guys go to the peep show together?  No, when you go into the variety centers and you go into the booths and you put a quarter  in, you would see that.  A quarter, a dollar, five dollars.  Is there room in the booth for you guys in the saddles?  No.  If you went and watched the next rated movie, you would see that.  Yeah.  You watch Showtime at 12 o'clock at night, you would see that.  You watch a lot of that softcore porno on the air?  Yeah, me too. 
[02:08:30]  I'm talking to Marion.  Yeah?  Okay.  And you got to chime in.  Yeah, we do.  What, do you and Marion sit there together like sitcom characters that never leave each  other?  We don't live together.  Now, there's a strap out.  There's a strap out.  All I know is this.  I saw a girl taking their pants off.  I know somebody who's into whips and chains.  Don't whip them hard.  Oh.  You'll hurt the little guy.  Lady dies into whips and chains?  No, it's a friend of mine.  He goes to those clubs.  All right, we got three very hot lesbian girls naked, and then we got these two over here. 
[02:09:00]  There's all kinds of stuff now.  They're pulling up the G-string and spanking each other and all kinds of stuff.  And then on the other side of the coin.  Nobody listens to me.  These gals are troopers.  For you.  No, for anyone.  This show stinks.  Clothes are back off.  And it's all your fault.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  I hope you get heckled tonight at the Stress Factory.  I hope they throw tomatoes at you.  It's all watching that.  There's a three-way girl chain going on. 
[02:09:30]  See, look at this.  Not bad.  These girls whip each other for pleasure.  These girls get whipped to go faster.  Yeah.  We don't get whipped.  I don't get whipped.  That's the issue.  Marion, Heather wanted to talk about your speech.  What's wrong?  Heather, tell Marion.  I just wanted to know if you went to high school or even junior high, for that matter,  because the manner in which you speak.  What?  I've heard 40-year-olds with a larger vocabulary. 
[02:10:00]  And they can pronounce their words as well.  Here we go.  I do.  What is your problem?  She's giving her the look.  What happened with the speech thing there?  The thing that really just set me off was picture.  I think it's just she's got a thick tongue.  I don't think it's any of anybody's business.  But we're listening to you.  How do you say that?  Another word for photograph.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is what?  Photograph.  What?  No.  What's the other word for it?  Photography. 
[02:10:30]  No.  You took a...  Picture.  What?  Oh.  What's wrong with the way she says that?  A picture because that's what you pour water out of.  You know what?  A picture.  The problem is, I was supposed to get braces when I was a teenager and I never did.  So I'm 38 years old and I'm paying it.  So what?  What's wrong with that?  Now the tragedy.  Like this.  What's wrong with your teeth?  Where were the braces supposed to go?  Stick your tongue out.  I have a little bit of an overbite.  Stick your tongue out.  I think it might be a thick tongue.  No.  You got a fat tongue?  No.  I have a little bit of an overbite and I had it when I was a kid.  A little bit?  A little bit.  You could eat corn on a cob through a picket fence. 
[02:11:00]  I don't mind it.  And when I was a teenager, the dentist at that time told me to get away.  Ran screaming from the room.  And I was being killed.  All right.  Mark has something.  Mark?  Yeah.  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, listen.  I got a good workout tip for Lady Di and Marion.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, they got to rejoin the herd that they broke away from and so they keep roaming the  plane.  Rejoin the herd.  What herd?  What herd? 
[02:11:30]  You should both be rooting naked through mud while birds land on your tail.  You don't even know why.  Let me tell you something, honey.  I ain't fat because I don't even weigh 200 pounds.  You don't even know me.  That's a great selling point.  I may have a big bust, but you don't know me.  You don't know me.  Why don't you try to grow?  For the record, I weigh 100 pounds.  You weigh 100 pounds.  I don't weigh 200 pounds.  She goes, I'm not fat.  I don't even weigh 200 pounds.  I know.  I weigh 100 pounds.  You weigh 100 pounds.  Why don't you go start crossing the river so the crocodiles can go after you? 
[02:12:00]  Why are you lying?  He said start crossing the river so the crocodiles can go after you.  Why don't you cross the river so the alligators can get you?  Why don't you go in the ocean?  Wow, what a comeback.  Why don't you go in the ocean?  I love the Marion comeback.  I'm just trying to get you.  All right.  Marion, please, stop tripping over your tongue.  Why don't you go sleep with the fishes?  Please, Marion, stop tripping over your tongue.  I want sopranos.  It's funny she says sleep with the fishes.  She's actually built like Luca Bronsi.  Very appropriate. 
[02:12:30]  Marion, how tall are you?  4'11", about?  No, I'm about 5'2".  5'2".  On her side.  And how much do you weigh?  On her side.  What do you weigh?  185?  182.  That's just her arm.  All right, Mark.  Thank you.  All right, buddy.  I don't mind.  Why?  I don't mind.  Mike wants to say something.  Mike?  You know why?  Because I want to.  All right, all right.  Mike, what's up?  Yeah, what happened when she was a little girl and her parents kept the egg beater plugged  in and she licked it?  Why?  Wow. 
[02:13:00]  When you were licking the maybe cake batter off of the electric mixer?  I don't bake.  I don't bake.  I don't bake.  She's gargling with her garter cheese.  I'm not a Susie homemaker.  I don't bake.  Gargling with her garter cheese.  Get those pigs off the air.  They're blackmailing into hell.  I don't bake and I don't eat garter cheese.  You eat monster cheese.  You sure suck.  Why do you eat monster cheese?  You are a bison.  You understand me?  Why are you coming back with these cookies?  I'm going to look at this.  You are a bison.  Oh, Lady Di wants to look at the lady.  Lady Di's getting so worked up. 
[02:13:30]  Lady Di has any type of suggestion in a name.  Lady Di.  Any type of contact on Lady Di in the action.  I dare you.  What did he say?  Lady Di, go over there and take a feel.  Lady Di, get a little closer.  No, no, no.  I'm not going to do that.  Just get a little closer and get a better look.  Last time I did that, everyone turned to stone.  We got our real wife.  I can see it from here.  I'm all right.  Yeah.  Lady Di, your wife is hot.  Lady Di, you're enjoying this?  With her real movies?  Wow.  Oh, that's nice.  Yes, I am.  You like that, Lady Di?  The show just got exponentially better. 
[02:14:00]  It looks all right.  What?  What's wrong with it?  See what you can look like if you do the health club for the next 20 years?  It ain't going to be 20 years.  It's going to be a year.  Maybe don't wear a baseball cap and a bad jacket.  Just get the United We Stand.  Probably bought it off of some goddamn foreigner down at Ground Zero.  You're dressed like a house painter from Chicago.  You are awful.  I bought the set in Kmart also, right?  Oh.  No.  Kmart also.  Buying all the United We Stand swag. 
[02:14:30]  Exactly.  That's where I got it from.  That's beautiful.  Great.  Holy ass.  Three hot girls.  Dude, the abuse is coming in.  Hold on.  Wow.  Listen to this one.  John, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  How are you doing?  All right.  Hey, what's up, man?  I think when they were supposed to get braces for Marion, they opted to give her the bit  like she put in a horse's mouth instead.  Why?  You look like a horse's ass.  Oh.  Here's a horse.  All right, lady guys.  All right.  Wow.  She showed you. 
[02:15:00]  Bye.  Wow.  There is a little daisy chain of chick.  Oh, get that shot.  There's a daisy chain of hot chick going on now.  Get that shot.  Who knew all we ought to do is get rid of that little weaselly prick that was selling this  show.  His little livery lips.  Rick and Steve are all proud of himself.  Are filming the action, and it'll be up on a website near you soon.  Lady Di, get a little closer.  Take a look.  Lady Di's getting all worked up.  Are you getting...  We don't have.  Come on. 
[02:15:30]  We have it.  Lady Di, are things flowing, let's say?  Are things working?  We may be a little bigger, but we have the same thing.  You don't have the same thing.  Lady, you have a tail.  We may be bigger, but we got the same thing.  Is that the line you're trying to sell?  Oh, my God.  Lady Di, would you wow the girls?  Because they're all showing.  Why don't you...  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Lady Di.  Lady Di.  A little wow.  Come on with your play-doh.  Look at this.  Here we go. 
[02:16:00]  Oh, boy.  Where do you see this, ladies?  Come on.  Watch this.  Here it is.  Here we go.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that looks just like that.  Yes.  That's exactly the same.  That looks like that in a funhouse mirror.  Jimmy, what's up?  Hey, guys.  On the gravity of Jupiter.  Jimmy.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  Actually, the word Jim is a secret word for AA.  Oh, do you think she's got to go to AA?  I think so, yeah.  No.  No, who?  Lady Di.  I think you're missing an A.  Her body's got to be fixed by triple A. 
[02:16:30]  Unless you're going to Abominations Anonymous.  I'll be fine.  Avetta.  Yes.  What's up?  Nothing that much.  Why are you calling this mess of a show today?  I want a queef.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  All right.  I thought we lost that bit.  God damn.  Thank God.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on, Avetta.  It's not a burp.  It's not a fart.  It's not too sweet.  It's not too tart.  It's six o'clock. 
[02:17:00]  It's time for a queef.  Thank you, man.  Blow out the candles.  Make a wish.  It's like a fart, but smells like fish.  It's six o'clock.  It's time for a queef.  Undo your pants.  Let them drop to the floor.  Tense up and let yourself roar.  Yeah.  Are you ready, Avetta?  Yes, I am.  All right.  Everybody, be quiet.  If you girls ruin this, I swear to God.  And I'm talking to the girls.  If you want a buffalo, ruin it.  There's really going to be a problem.  So hold on.  Hold on.  Avetta, please.  All right. 
[02:17:30]  If you will.  Now?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is that good enough?  That's perfect.  Sure, why not?  It's not a bird.  It's not a fart.  It's not too sweet.  It's not too tart.  It's six o'clock.  It's time for a queef.  Blow out the candles.  Make a wish.  It's like a fart, but smells like fish.  It's six o'clock.  It's time for a queef.  Undo your pants.  Let them drop to the floor.  Tense up and let yourself roar.  Queef.  What's wrong, ladies?  We're just walking. 
[02:18:00]  We didn't want to talk into the mic.  Oh, Adam, what's going on?  What's up, O&A?  Let the lady die.  Yo, does she have one of those, like, wooden plates, like those African guys in the Sahara?  Um, no.  Don't kill a bison, you spear-chuckers.  Goodbye.  You've got to see what she looks like.  A big, fat, pale head and thin lips.  She looks like a claymation.  Oh, Jesus.  Something out of a tool video.  Jim, look at the other girls over there.  Don't do it, Davey.  Yeah.  Gee, Davey.  Wow.  I'm a sailor. 
[02:18:30]  Sorry.  Some painters come from Chicago, David.  Hey, you're a picture bold.  Huh?  Colter.  What is she trying to...  What are you trying to say?  What are you trying to say?  I didn't say...  Ben told me something.  Well, she said it on the mic.  Yeah.  Yeah, the girls are going to town now.  What's going on now?  With little Jimmy's pants.  Wow.  What's going on with little Jimmy Norton's pants?  What are they doing?  Not what...  I'd like...  Oh. 
[02:19:00]  What's going on over there?  Nothing.  With a mouthful.  Wow.  Okay.  Looks like there's something going on over there.  Did she bite you?  No.  Ow.  Oh, is it the hot breath through the pants gag?  No, a little more.  This is fun watching over here.  Shut up, Lady Di.  Just ruining it.  Yeah, die, you whore bag.  You ugly bitches. 
[02:19:30]  Hey, Frenchy.  Yes, it's me again.  What's up, Frenchy?  What do you got to say to the Lady Di and Marion?  Hi, Frenchy.  You annoying fat bitches.  See you, you filthy sea.  No, how are you doing?  Shut up.  Shut up, you whore.  Come here and shut me up.  Yeah, yeah, I wiped my ass.  You Canadian.  Queer?  It's not Canadian.  What do you say?  Frenchy's Canadian.  You whore bag.  Let's call French Canadians.  Are you from Canada?  Are you from Canada? 
[02:20:00]  Can, can, can, can, can, can.  What's this guy doing?  Canadian, Canadian.  Can, can, can, can, can, can.  You Canadian geese.  You Canadian geese.  Shut up, you twat.  He says, are you from Canada?  Are you from Canada?  Yeah, yeah.  Canadians are from Canada?  You Canadian geese.  You fat whores.  You Canadian geese.  You dirty sea.  The only thing you know is suck sea, you whore bag.  Hey, geese, you goose.  Go back to Jersey, you stupid hole, you twat.  You goose.  You look like goose crap.  Loser.  Die, die.  Die, you twat.

Go outside and get hit by a stupid city truck, you twat.  Go find a park you could crap in.  Yeah, shut the head up, you whore.  You geek.  All right, Frenchy.  Thank you.  All right, take it easy.  There it goes.  Frenchy loves these two girls.  I've been to Canada.  I think they speak French up from Canada.  Dorn, can I ask you a question? 
[02:21:00]  Is your junk out?  No.  Oh, okay.  I'm just saying the way she's traveling.  No.  It looked like there was some hardcore action going on.  Dorn might be late to the stress factory tonight.  My junk is pointed down to the right.  Sort of like the bullet that shot Kennedy.  Yeah, the magic bullet.  Yeah, exactly.  I'm just ready to go through Governor Connolly's hand.  Ruben.  Lady Di.  Lady Di.  I know what you can do with your hair.  What can I do with my hair?  Oh.  The album definitely got dumped out of.  Don't dump out of that. 
[02:21:30]  It's all content.  Wow, Ruben.  Ruben had to kill a line.  That's how pissed off people are getting.  He basically said, I know what you're going to put in your hair.  I know what I'm going to do with my hair.  I'm going to get it cut nice.  That's what I'm going to do.  He goes, I know what you can do with your hair.  Put a bullet through it, you effing C.  Who is this guy?  He's still on the radio?  What?  What's wrong?  What's this guy?  Who?  He's on a phone?  Who?  What are you talking about? 
[02:22:00]  He's a little fool.  Put on the phone.  Oh, my God.  All right, we've got to take a break, yeah.  No, we don't.  No, we don't.  We're going to start the radio show next.  Yeah, finally.  Opie and Anthony.  We're a bunch of perverted crackers.  Oh, what?  It's hard to listen to us trying to talk teen girls into doing stuff with each other.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And E.W.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  And we're sorry. 
[02:22:30]  Adam Farrar in the studio.  Hello.  Our pal, he's on the job, and the bastard puts a wow sticker.  Yep.  Yeah.  In the show.  Right on the wall by his desk.  Thank you, Adam.  Sure.  The email exploded, man.  Yeah.  Which means a lot of people checking out the job on ABC.  Wednesdays.  At 9.30.  At 9.30.  Girl's still naked.  Nice.  All kinds of hiking.  Where did the sled dogs go? 
[02:23:00]  They're outside taking a break.  Mike, what's going on?  Oh, and hey.  Hey.  Let's go.  Dude, all I can say is thank God for the stinky cam.  Holy crap.  You don't understand the contrast between looking at them on the screen and listening to the  fat fall off those two pigs.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, because if you're watching the stinky cam, you're seeing some wild stuff.  But if you're just listening to the radio, you're hearing some awful stuff.  Awful.  Yeah, guys.  I love you guys, but it's a total waste without the stinky cam today. 
[02:23:30]  All right, cool.  Thanks.  Thanks, Mike.  Which one's the stinky cam?  The little one.  That one?  Yeah, is it actually pointing that way?  The one is on now.  Oh, there we go.  You better get Lady Di back in here because they're getting abused by the listeners.  Good.  They should at least be able to fight back.  Jim, didn't you have to leave like a half hour ago?  I'm leaving in two minutes.  Dude, I don't like to walk out on the show.  You ruined this show today.  I didn't.  You ruined it.  You should feel awful.  I like how during the commercial breaks, the girls get off of him. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah.  I agree.  And then during the show, they're back in his lap and...  Cut!  I've stayed in the lap.  Believe me, I'm under no illusion.  I know why they're on my lap.  I'm just grateful that they're there for any reason.  I don't care if they're there because they want to solve world hunger.  It doesn't matter.  No, you can't tell.  See, that's good.  Walk's as good as a hit.  You're on base.  Exactly.  Stay there.  Dan, what's up?  I just wanted to let you guys know that Lady Di reminds me of Admiral Ackbar. 
[02:24:30]  That squid-looking guy from Thoroughbred.  Who the heck is that?  You probably look like him.  And if you don't look like him, you look like that Lando Calrissian sidekick in the Millennium Falcon with those fish lips.  I'd like to see what you look like.  I look a lot better than your Jabba the Hutt tongue.  I mean, you are disgusting.  I think you're trying to make fun of Marion with that.  You don't want to make fun of me.  All right.  Marion, Marion, what's up? 
[02:25:00]  Hey, guys.  I'm just checking in to let you know that effective today, you're syndicated in Kananida, and I and my family are faithful Kananian listeners.  Kananida.  Kananida.  Shut up.  Go back to Kananida.  Have a good weekend.  That sounds good.  I hate you, Canadians.  Go back to Kananida.  Kananida.  Kananida.  That was funny.  Joe, what's up?  Well, it was.  It's just made up a city.  Joe.  Joe, Joe, Joe.  I'm here. 
[02:25:30]  You're on the radio.  Let's go.  I just wanted to say it's time for the two window lickers to put the hockey helmets on and get back on the short bus and go home.  Go ahead, Marion.  Where's your home?  Do you have a home?  Oh, wow.  Good one.  Good one.  So you go home.  Good one.  Her first break.  None of that.  None of that.  Crap out.  None of that there, Marion.  Sorry.  Kurt, what's up?  In the real life.  Sorry.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey.  Bunkhouse.  Hey. 
[02:26:00]  Was Marianna her hermaphrodite when she was born because she doesn't sound like any woman I've ever met?  I know who?  Are you a hermaphrodite?  You got a C in your pants.  Are you a Y?  Am I a Y?  Yeah.  You sound like a moron.  What did your father do?  Did he mix cement in your mouth when you were a kid?  No.  Did he mix cement in your butt?  You sound like a moron.  You sound like a moron.  I can just listen.  Good girl, wife. 
[02:26:30]  I can't say, canadia.  Get a life.  Stupid C.  Hey.  Your sister.  I swear, you know, I don't blame the listeners.  They just, they're pissed off today.  It's all your fault, Jim Norton.  Jim.  It's not my fault.  Are you paying attention?  Oh, what the hell?  Yeah.  Did you see that?  I was not paying attention over there.  That's not where his wallet is, ladies, Jim.  You are, you're getting handy.  No, no.  Yeah, yeah.  Dude, stop.  What?  Don't I'm standing here talking?  Daisy. 
[02:27:00]  Hey.  How much are you packing, Jim?  I got, I got like, I'd say five, five and a half going at the moment.  And that's just from sitting there with no real work from me.  And that's with those two talking, which is miraculous.  That is miraculous.  Daisy, what's up?  I don't think you're paying attention.  Hi, guys.  I'm a friend of Amy's from Los Angeles, and I'm actually a good friend of Jim Norton.  Hi.  How are you, sweetheart?  It's good to talk to you.  I'm so happy to hear that Amy's on the show.  I love you, Daisy.  I love you, too, Amy. 
[02:27:30]  Wait, you're a friend of Norton's, too?  Yes, I am.  So you know people in common?  A platonic friend.  Yes.  Unfortunately.  This guy, this goddess, he's trying to bamboozle everybody.  Norton, you are trying to bamboozle everybody.  Dude, she's really my friend.  She's honestly my friend.  I swear to goodness I'm his friend.  No sexual contact with Daisy at all.  Absolutely not.  Although I've given him some shows, but that's about it.  Yeah, she's a good friend.  Yeah, first.  And I'm actually going to be performing tonight, too. 
[02:28:00]  Oh, no.  More plugs.  Go ahead, Daisy.  I'm going to be on the casexradio.com tonight, The Wanker Show, from 7 to 9 Pacific time.  You're like a radio show.  We don't.  Thank you, Daisy.  No problem.  Hey, where's The Real Wife?  What's your website again?  www.therealwife.com.  Therealwife.com.  There you go.  She is very hot.  I'd marry her.  When you see Daisy again, can you just smack her in the face?  Dave, what's up?  She's in L.A.  She's in L.A.  Guys, I can't handle this. 
[02:28:30]  Get these wildebeests off the air.  They make me want to go see Voss.  Don't do what you want to do.  We're fine.  I've listened to this show since you guys started in Cleveland.  Well, let me tell you.  You make me want to go back to other channels.  You know what?  Don't do what you got to do.  You make me want to drink a piece of grain alcohol and fall into something.  Why don't you go fall into a big vat of kerosene?  If I wanted someone to run, I'd go see you.  Wow.  Why? 
[02:29:00]  Go back to the zoo, heifer.  You live in a zoo, buddy.  Oh.  Yeah, I live with your mom.  She doesn't smell.  Hey, don't talk about my mother, because if I would meet you, and if you'd meet me,  I'd take you from here.  You people who reproduced sexually.  What?  What, sexually?  Hey, at least I have sex.  I'm sorry you don't have a vocabulary.  That's not my fault.  At least I have sex.  Fire plug does not count.  I have sex.  You are right, though, Norma.  I have sex.  Thank you, Dave.  You don't have sex.  Yeah, I do. 
[02:29:30]  With who?  I have a husband.  He doesn't have sex with you.  How if we don't?  No, he doesn't.  If he ever called the show, ask him.  When was the last time you had sex with your husband?  Yeah, when was the last time?  None of your buddies.  I know it's none of our bisonists, but when was it?  When was the last time he was doing it consensually?  I don't think it's anybody's business.  I'd rather not say.  You could say when.  You don't have to get into details.  I would rather not say.  All right.  Who was in office? 
[02:30:00]  I'm not saying.  Was it within a week?  I'm not saying.  Within a week.  Why don't you have sex with your husband?  No, we don't need to know that.  Was it before George Wallace was paralyzed?  Was it before?  When was the last time you had it?  Ten seconds ago, I saw.  Yeah, exactly.  Out of for our job Wednesday night, it's 9.30.  It seems like you're a second to go for now.  Brianna.  That's too personal.  Hi, guys.  Hi, Brianna.  Opie, I just want to say first, I think you're so damn sexy.  Oh, thank you. 
[02:30:30]  And for Miriam, you have the proportions of that little fat clown from Spawn.  Oh, wow.  5-2-1-25, baby, not 5-2-1-85.  What?  Uh-huh.  You sound like a retard.  If I were to write, shut up.  I'm not a retard.  I'm a college graduate, honey.  Yeah, well, what kind of work do you do?  Good.  You went to college?  Good.  I'm a nursing student.  Good.  I'm in college.  Good.  Good for you.  Oh, you're really slamming her, Miriam.  And you guys, I think she likes me.  Yeah, don't make us bring Frenchie back. 
[02:31:00]  Hey, and I can't wait for you guys to come to Cleveland, because I need to give you a personal wow.  Oh, nice.  Well, I hope you're helping us out with the wow when you see the stickers.  I haven't, you know what, I've only seen one.  But I can't wait to see more, because I can't wait to wow these guys out here.  Yeah, we'll get up there.  Thank you, Brianna.  Okay, thank you.  Peace.  Bye.  I'm the end of the graduate.  Oh, good.  Good.  Good.  I say we get Frenchie back on the line.  Frenchie.  Frenchie.  Frenchie.  Frenchie. 
[02:31:30]  Frenchie, Ron.  Frenchie.  Round two.  Married and Frenchie.  Pick up the phone, you uncircumcised coward.  Joe, what's up?  I don't know if that Canadian geese was on.  Hey, shut up.  Joe, what's up?  Yo, I'm going to the Navy on Monday, and this is the worst episode I've ever heard, and this  is the last one I want to hear, because you have them two fat slobs on there.  You're killing me.  This has to be the last LNA show you hear.  This is the last one I want to hear for like eight months.  The last memory of Opie and Anthony.  You're killing me, man.  I'm sorry.  You've got two fat heifers on there talking about, they don't even know what they're talking  about. 
[02:32:00]  We're not fat.  We're just big girls.  You're not fat.  We're just big girls.  Lady.  You're not fat.  It sounds like you're chewing on a turkey right now.  You're not fat.  That's why you've got a speech impediment.  Are you going to the Navy, or I guess they're going to go send you to Afghanistan and try  to look for bin Laden.  Good luck.  Hey, don't make fun of the military.  Good luck.  I'm protecting you.  I'm not making fun of the military.  My God, Marion.  I'm protecting your fat ass, aren't I?  Do you understand?  This guy is protecting your fat ass.  Wow, Marion.  I can't believe you went there.  Marion, you have to apologize.  I cannot believe you went there. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah.  Say you're sorry.  I'm not making fun of the military.  Say you're sorry I'm taking away the salt lick.  I don't care.  The what?  The salt lick.  What salt lick?  That guy is fighting for your rights.  He's fighting for the rights.  He is.  For you to be a mush-mouthed elephant on the radio.  That's good.  I'm glad he's fighting for our rights.  She was in the Navy.  Shut up.  Shut up, Thin Lips.  Hey, Diane was in the Navy at one time.  Oh, she was?  She was a PT boat.  Exactly.  Lady Di, you were in the Navy?  What did you do? 
[02:33:00]  That was a while ago.  What did you do?  Did they land little planes on your back?  No.  She wore the Malcolm X jacket and helicopters landed on her back.  What did you do in the Navy?  That was a while ago.  I got on an honor roll and that was it.  What did you do in the Navy?  What was your MLS?  I was a cook in the Navy.  You were a cook.  Did the sailor get any of the food?  Yeah, really?  Is that why you got discharged?  I was a good cook, too.  You were a cook in the Navy on a ship?  This was years ago. 
[02:33:30]  Was it on a ship?  No.  It was on a base.  How many years ago?  What base?  In Florida.  20 years ago.  What?  20 years ago.  20 years ago?  That was a long time ago.  It was a while ago.  Thank you, Marion.  How long were you in?  For about two years.  And what happened that you got discharged?  I just got an honorable discharge.  Why?  Did you get caught with a jelly donut in your foot locker?  Because I'm hungry, sir.  They're paying for it. 
[02:34:00]  You eat it.  Hi, Anthony.  We got audio of Lady Di as they kicked her out of the Navy.  Oh, really?  Oh, no.  Boy, can you see this one coming, kids?  I got nowhere else to go.  I didn't hear that.  I got nowhere else to go.  Stop.  Is that what I heard?  I got nothing else.  Oh, we got our drill instructor on the air.  Oh, yeah?  There is no racial bigotry here. 
[02:34:30]  I do not look down on niggers, kites, flops, or greasers.  You are a disgusting fat body.  Frenchy!  Yes, I'm back.  Hey, Frenchy.  Tell those two filthy animals to shut the hell up, all right?  Why don't you go back to baking?  You are...  Wait.  I'm not talking to you, you effing taux.  Go back to baking.  What's baking?  I'm not from Canada, you twat.  You sound like you're from Canada.  I'm from France, you stupid bitch.  But they have French people that live in Canada.  Hey, you're in school. 
[02:35:00]  Did you know a little bit of geography over there?  No, I don't think so.  Geography.  You stupid f***.  Yes, she has a f***ing...  Die, you twat.  Why don't you goddamn die already?  Why don't you die first?  I'll die after you.  You know what?  When I saw you the first time, I looked at you and said, she has to be the dumbest whore  in the world.  She...  Yeah, you must have a chromosome left over in the toilet every time you go to the bathroom  every day.  You stupid whore. 
[02:35:30]  You down serum twat whore.  Fat bitch.  Yeah, you look like a down serum.  You whore.  Why don't you go outside and die?  Oh.  God, nice.  Only the truth hurts, you stupid fat bitch.  Hey, when you're baking, why don't you take it out of the bag?  When I'm baking, I make wonder, you stupid whore.  And you go to the bathroom and you drop a stupid chromosome every day.  You become a little more... 
[02:36:00]  You know what?  You sound like you're queer.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So if you're calling me a whore, I'd rather be called a whore than be called a gay.  Well, you look like a down serum bitch and you're married.  I don't know what kind of husband you have.  That's none of your business.  Are you married?  You must be a retard also, isn't he?  Are you married?  Yes, I'm married.  Yes, I'm married.  I feel sorry for your wife.  Yeah, well, I don't want to see your husband.  He must look like you.  No, you don't.  No, yeah, I'm sure.  Your wife must be really, really... 
[02:36:30]  Where is she?  Where is your wife?  Oh, well, what do you want to know?  Yeah, because I want to tell her what a jerk you are.  You sound like a real jerk.  You know, you sound smart for once, but you know what?  You dumbass anyway.  I'm not a dumbass.  You retarded whole bag.  Die, die.  I get in the coffin and die.  All right, Frenchy.  All right.  All right, Frenchy.  Nice to see you later, guys.  All right, thanks.  There you go.  Wow.  Frenchy.  Who thought you'd see the Frenchman with a second wave of assault like that?  Never.  Wayne, you're next on the O.P. Anthony show. 
[02:37:00]  You guys really do suck today.  Yeah, I know.  Frenchy blows.  Yeah.  Hey, I might be playing a couple word games later tonight, and I just wanted to ask Marion,  how many N's are in Canada?  Canada.  Canada.  Geography.  One N.  Canada.  One N.  C-A-N-A-D-A.  All right.  Thank you.  There you go.  Goddamn.  Jesus.  Can we set the clock back?  I did it to be funny when I was in Canada.  To three and started all over again. 
[02:37:30]  Oh, Jim, you've got to go.  Oh, now you've got to go.  All right, Jim.  Would you finish now that you've used us for your own pleasures?  No, I was trying to stay with the radio show as long as possible.  I don't like to walk out in the middle of the O.P. and Anthony show, not even for the  stress factory.  I don't like that.  There's two beautiful girls here.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  She doesn't.  She said she doesn't like when they joke about her husband.  She doesn't.  They're communicating by sonar.  So callers, callers, just goof on her.  Yeah, no, no, no.  She doesn't like it.  She doesn't like when people make fun of her husband. 
[02:38:00]  And, you know, I agree with you.  Oh, that's very nice of you, Jim.  You know, just because he has no judgment, there's no reason that he should be made fun  of.  He has plenty of judgment.  He has a lot of judgment, believe me.  All right, everyone relax.  So knock it off.  We're talking about him, please.  I'm not talking about him.  So just goof on my husband all the time.  And when you see this Canadian guy, Frenchie again, or just wherever he's from,  Tom, then, you know, Canada.  Yeah, he's from France.  He's from France.  That's where French people are from, France. 
[02:38:30]  That's funny.  I said it to be funny.  I didn't say it.  Sure you did.  I did.  All right.  And I suppose you'll be pulling off a mask in that costume, too, telling us you did that  to be funny.  Ah, Psycho Mark.  Dude, he's a mutant.  He's a friggin' mutant.  Oh, Psycho Mark.  Hi, Mark.  How you doing, Mark?  How you doing?  One day she came by the Fox window and nearly horrified the entire crew.  Pounding on the glass.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  Waving, waving, waving. 
[02:39:00]  It's true you guys pound on the glass, right?  No.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Outside Fox, when they're doing their little morning show, you guys are outside, right?  That morning?  Well, we have news, I think.  After news, right?  Okay.  Did the Fox News...  It doesn't matter.  They show up and aggravate us.  Did the Fox News crew panic and think we'd been nuked and some kind of mutant people were  walking around after the nuclear holocaust?  Who was that?  All right, Mark.  Yeah.  Thank you, guys.  All right, Dan.  We're going to start the show next. 
[02:39:30]  Did Jim finally leave?  Yeah.  Norton is finally out of here.  Now, the guy's limping.  You know what?  This is a hell of a lot hotter watching the girls sitting on chairs on top of each other  than it is Norton.  Oh, that's very nice.  Look at that.  Soft.  Go watch a car movie.  Touching.  Look at that.  Look at you.  I think she's feeding her like the mother penguin.  Wow.  Can you watch a car movie and see the same thing she does?  Not live like this.  Live is always better than on film.  Yeah.  We know. 
[02:40:00]  We know.  How do you know?  Wow.  You go to the live sex shows?  That's kind of nice there.  No, because there ain't any.  Hey, do this often?  What are you doing, Rick, moving her foot?  Shut up.  Rick's like making sure body parts are in the right place.  What do you buy?  Your chicks buy?  No.  No, you're strictly...  I'm straight.  I'm completely straight.  Are you?  Yeah, sure.  Okay.  Yeah.  I'm so buy.  I'm so bisexual. 
[02:40:30]  You're straight and they're thin.  And these two are bi, too.  Buy as much food and eat it as they can.  He's a son of a bitch.  Anthony.  That guy's a rapist.  Opie and Anthony.  And E.W.  All right.  Time to start the Opie and Anthony show.  Our guest today, Adam Pryor from the job.  We're on the air now.  Yes. 
[02:41:00]  Oh, we're starting the show now.  We just did a little...  I just had the weirdest dream.  I just dreamed we did like four hours and it was horrible.  That was just our warm-up.  Yeah.  A little warm-up.  We were just warming up the audience.  Hey.  Why are there hoof prints in the studio?  What a mess.  Yeah.  Well, it happens.  Between the mixed communications, the little worms that were in here today, trying to whore 
[02:41:30]  out websites and whatnot.  Yeah.  Somewhere along the line, the show may have hit a pothole or two.  Yeah.  But, as always, next week.  The one lesbian needs to plug her website again.  Yeah.  It's therealwife.com.  Is that it?  Therealwife.com.  Therealwife.com.  Yes.  I'm Amy from therealwife.com.  What does that mean?  Like, I don't even know what that means.  The real wife.  I'm the real wife. 
[02:42:00]  And I have a site and I, you know...  But what do you mean by, like, the real wife?  Well, because generally when people think of wives, they don't think of, you know, sexual  beings or bisexual women or, you know...  So you're like the real wife.  Real horny, you know...  Oh, okay.  ...slutty type of things out there, you know?  Okay.  So, and that's it.  I got a lot of...  And what goes on on this Real Wife website?  Cooking?  Everything from...  We just got back from Las Vegas.  You log on and get bitched at.  It's great. 
[02:42:30]  Just like real wife.  Where the hell have you been?  It was the weasel's fault.  I logged on to that site and half my money would disappear.  It was amazing.  Actually, I got the full 100,000.  Oh, you did?  That's what I used to find the website.  From the weasel?  Yeah.  That's cool.  Well, you're very beautiful and I'm sure you go to that website and...  You're therealimpressivewife.com.  Thank you very much, Adam.  Norton ruined the whole show.  Some of the feedbacks are great.  Lieutenant Boogaloo said,  A vat of kerosene. 
[02:43:00]  You live in the zoo, buddy.  Asexually, at least I have sex.  Staggering comebacks.  Staggering.  That's why I said...  Don't talk about my friend like that.  Kevin, what's going on?  What's happening, guys?  Hey.  I learned three things on the show today.  All right.  I learned that the new STD is sylifus.  I learned that Tylenol tackles the hiv.  Yep.  And that the two most important things to Norton are mules and the juices flowing through them.  Very good, Kevin. 
[02:43:30]  Take it easy.  Good job.  Let's go to Tom.  Tom, what did you learn on the show today?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Today I learned that Marion's overbite is so bad she could eat corn on the cob through a picket fence.  That's fine.  Do me a favor.  Next time she's in studio, ask her how much time Lemma Tuzak had to spend with her to develop his character when he played Sloth in Goonies.  You'll play Sloth in Goonies.  Take it easy, guys.  You'll play Sloth in Goonies.  You've got to bring Marion in for the abuse.  Well, the comebacks are the best part.  Chris, what's up? 
[02:44:00]  Yeah, guys.  Hey.  Today I learned a treadmill is not a wand.  Right.  And today's show is almost as easy to follow as foundry music is to navigate.  Hey, listen.  Is Adam still there?  Yeah.  Adam, you need to get O&A on the car radio during a driving scene.  Yeah.  That would be cool.  That's good.  Later, guys.  Hey, thanks, Chris.  That's fine.  Gus from Jersey.  I learned today one bed bagel causes Opie to create something that resembles a murder scene in stall number one.  And Norton getting felt up, always my brand of humor. 
[02:44:30]  Norm from Staten Island.  I learned you need a keyboard to use the phone, Anthony.  Yes.  That one was done.  Falls from Sleepy Hollow.  I learned today you're not fat if you weigh less than 200 pounds.  Less than two bills.  Yeah.  Steve from Portland, Oregon, Anthony.  Hey, Portland.  Are we on in Portland, Oregon?  Yes.  Yeah.  Hey, how about that?  Hey, hello, Portland.  What's up, Portland?  Hey, Portland.  We want to apologize for the show today.  We learned yesterday that we're on in Seattle, and today we're learning about we're on in Portland, Oregon. 
[02:45:00]  Hey, Portland.  Say hello to Portland.  How are you, Portland?  Oh, God.  Yeah, you guys are on in Portland.  How are we?  How are we?  How's everything going in Oregon?  All right.  Oregon.  Anyway, Steve writes, I learned that if you aren't from a major East Coast city, your instant message doesn't get read.  This is the sixth day in a row I've sent an instant message without being read, you tools.  There you go.  Sheep Lover writes, I learned today poo stinks because of bacteria. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah, we did learn that.  He also learned three-quarters of a turd is made up of?  Of?  Water.  Very good.  Crumpin Muncher writes, I learned today Adam always wants to be where Norton's mule juice is flowing.  That's it.  Rob from Jersey today, I learned the Titanic had a band.  Well, we all know that.  Danielle from Alabama, Anthony.  Ant lives 16 miles from the station.  I learned Ant has never been to elsewhere. 
[02:46:00]  No.  Norton beats AIDS with Tylenol, and there's a good side to Saudi Arabia.  Thank you.  Hooked on phonics, worked for Marion, and she still has the hook in her mouth.  You got a hook in your butt.  Oh, there it is.  You're arguing with instant feedback.  Wow.  Brother Joe.  Joe, gentlemen.  Hey.  Hey, Adam.  Hiya, pal.  Great show, my friend.  How you doing, Joe?  I'm doing good.  Oh, shut up.  What I learned on the show today was it is just a whore plug fest. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah.  And since it is, I'd like to say that I'm playing in Poughkeepsie with the Good Rats at the Croft Corner Cafe.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Your life has gotten there?  So you're playing in Poughnipsie?  Poughkeepsie.  Where in Poughnipsie?  Poughkeepsie.  It was not in Poughkeepsie.  Poughkeepsie.  Poughkeepsie.  Poughkeepsie.  All right, gentlemen.  I'll talk to you soon.  All right.  There you go.  Brother Joe.  Bye, Joey.  Yeah.  Well, Lady Di, why don't you show up there drunk off your ass and get on stage and sing while 
[02:47:00]  he's trying to do a song?  I am not going to do that ever again.  Oh, why not?  You did it once already.  No, I'm not going to do that.  I'm not going to do that.  You know what you are, though?  When you get drunk, you're that completely unreasonable person.  So when you get drunk and you say you're not going to do this again, you'll do it again  anyway.  No, I won't.  Because you're drunk and you're out of control.  I really won't.  You will.  I won't do that again.  Mark my words.  Yeah, Betty.  She's going to acknowledge that she's drunk.  Look, I know I'm drunk.  I know I'm drunk.  I went there and she'll tell me 20,000 times.  I'm so sorry.  I'm sorry.  Anthony.  Anthony. 
[02:47:30]  Anthony.  Anthony.  I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry.  Well, shut up.  You should get the abuse.  Right?  She's just like that.  Right, Marion?  Yeah.  Angie.  Hey.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  What's up?  I learned today that Norton plus three lesbians equals four inches.  To the man.  And he doesn't even stick around the cuddle when he's done.  No.  He bolted.  He ruined our show and then he leaves.  He leaves us.  I think he rules.  All right.  At least he took the wet spot with him. 
[02:48:00]  Most people leave her.  Jerry from Medicine.  Today I learned never eat the clear, sweaty Swiss cheese.  And only a faggot hat comic looks twice at Oz.  Cancer Mike writes, I learned how not to force it.  What's your relationship with the Opie and Anthony show?  Mm-hmm.  And Enigma.  Today I learned that giving someone a high five is no longer a good thing.  Right.  They have.  Oh, man.  Well, we try to do something today.  Eh, you know, what are you going to do?  You move on. 
[02:48:30]  I can't have a contest.  Yeah, right.  You guys are.  We do have a real contest and you're coming back to be in it.  Yes, I will come back next week.  And we got a really good prize.  No BS.  No BS.  Yeah, no, a real prize.  $12 American.  We got cold hard cash and a trip to hedonism.  Yeah, so you've got to come back next week and bring a naughty at nighty.  It's the naughty nighty contest.  That is a contest.  That's definitely happened.  Go to opianthony.com for all the details.  Right.  Well, ladies, it's as simple as this.  Tuesday will be the next day. 
[02:49:00]  When we lose weight.  What?  What?  Can we answer when we lose weight?  Can we answer the contest when we lose weight?  I want you to answer the contest like that.  You guys, you're going to answer the contest?  That's a naughty fortnighty.  No, after we start working out and I start losing weight.  She did fill up her shirt for us.  And I lose some of this.  Yes, you did.  Okay.  Nick, what's up?  I lose some of that.  I just wanted to tell you what I learned today.  I learned that SeaWorld now offers exercise programs.  I also learned that if a guy gives you fish and plank and chips, he qualifies as a husband. 
[02:49:30]  Very good.  Oh.  Oh.  What was that?  Oh, Marion's getting pissed again.  Mike, what's up?  Hello?  Hey.  What's going on?  I learned that Lady Di's best comeback is calling someone goose crap.  I wasn't Lady Di and I said it was me.  It was Marion.  Marion getting the coffin, you stupid hose bag.  It was me.  All right.  Jamie.  Hey, what's up, guys?  From D.C.? 
[02:50:00]  Yeah.  I learned the real reason why Opie and Anthony's ratings have tanked in D.C.  Okay.  Okay.  Why?  All right.  That's the reason why I'm hung up.  I'm trying to see what the message is there.  There should have been a punchline.  Yeah.  I wonder why those people in D.C. don't know what they're doing.  For a really good insult or something.  Your ratings will go up.  Don't worry about that.  I'm sure we're going to...  Thank you, Lady Di.  Thank you for the encouragement.  Your ratings will go up everywhere.  That's right.  That's what I say, too.  I say the same thing.  Like your weight, right?  No, it's going down.  No, it's not going...  It's going down. 
[02:50:30]  Oh, it's going to go down.  Don't you always listen to the radio?  All right, we've got to get out to you.  You've got to work on your diet, too.  Even on a treadmill, we'll be listening to this.  I don't eat junk food.  No?  Before you say that, I eat junk food.  How much baleen and plankton do you take in?  Neither.  Lady Di, isn't it true that you weren't given an honorable discharge from the Navy?  They just decommissioned you and put you in a mothball fleet off of Jersey?  Honorable discharge.  She doesn't even get what you...  Oh, God.  They're priceless.  They scraped the barnacles off of her and retired out of the mothball fleet. 
[02:51:00]  No, they did not.  All right, let's hear it for the retards today.  Yes.  Isn't it true you were discharged?  Because whenever you went for a swim off of the battleship,  all the enemy subs would pick up your ping.  Single ping.  Let's hear it for Adam Farrar.  Adam, yes.  Good job, Wednesday night.  9.30 on ABC.  Thank you, my pal.  My pal.  And, of course, the lesbians!  Yeah, yeah.  They did a great job today.  Please, come see us at VRP Club of New York at 20 West 20th Street.  All right, we got off on the wrong foot and then everything got fine. 
[02:51:30]  And we'll see you guys.  Have a great weekend, all right?  All right.  All right. </pre>
