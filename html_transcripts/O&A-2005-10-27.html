<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a segment analyzing a recording of a furious mother screaming at her son for his credit card. Opie speculated the son recorded it intentionally, while Anthony partially defended the mother, connecting her anger to the perceived lack of acceptable physical discipline today.  Studio guest Steve, along with the hosts and callers, shared personal anecdotes about their own childhood experiences with angry parents, highlighting physical punishment and its psychological impact.  Callers recounted extreme parental behaviors and disciplinary techniques, with one comparing the mother in the recording to Mrs. Crabtree from South Park. A man dressed as Crocodile Dundee briefly called in to wish Jim Norton a happy birthday.  The segment concluded with further speculation on the mother-son relationship and the changing dynamics of parenting.


Next, the show interviewed the band Mudvayne.  The discussion covered their touring experiences, contrasting the romanticized idea of rock stardom with its reality.  They discussed fan interactions, ranging from pleasant to obsessive stalking, with one member recounting an incident involving Bill Ward of Black Sabbath. The band detailed their creative process, musical evolution, and reactions to fan feedback on message boards.  They answered listener questions about their name, face paint, and song meanings.  The interview then took an unexpectedly vulgar turn with a call from comedian Jay Moore, sparking a sexually explicit conversation involving strippers, sexual acts, and various celebrities. This was followed by more listener calls and discussion of Moore's personal life and past appearances on the show.  The segment concluded with the hosts playing a lengthy, awkward 14-minute audio "mixtape" from a teenage boy to his girlfriend, eliciting varied reactions.


The show then moved to a segment heavily featuring listener calls about awkward teenage crushes, including tales of anonymous letters and obsessive stalking.  This transitioned into a heated confrontation between Patrice O'Neal and Vinny Brand, the owner of the Stress Factory comedy club. Brand criticized O'Neal's poor ticket sales, triggering a back-and-forth filled with insults and personal attacks referencing O'Neal's recent hospitalization. Brand highlighted instances where O'Neal’s jokes upset patrons, with one couple reportedly leaving in tears. The argument included offensive remarks about O'Neal's weight, personality, and comedy.  The conversation shifted to Anthony's dental work, leading to a discussion of painful dental procedures, and then to the oversaturation of certain t-shirt designs, prompting further listener calls and comments.  The segment also included brief mentions of Hurricane Katrina coverage.  Patrice O'Neal and Vinny Brand were in-studio guests.


A subsequent segment focused heavily on listener calls detailing provocative and offensive t-shirt slogans, including those featuring Iron Crosses, swastikas, and references to JonBenét Ramsey.  A caller recounted a story about his wife's weight gain, leading to a sexually suggestive discussion about his attraction to larger women.  Charles Ross, a one-man Star Wars show performer, was a guest, performing a brief excerpt.  However,  negative and abusive calls from listeners visibly upset Ross, leading to his abrupt departure and a subsequent apologetic phone call explaining his illness and frustration with the abusive callers.  The segment concluded with a discussion of a video showing one of the hosts' friends involved in a sexual act at a swingers party.


The final segment consisted of the hosts listening to and commenting on an audio recording of a sexual encounter.  The hosts provided extensive, sexually explicit commentary and jokes about anal sex, using vulgar language throughout. They analyzed the audio quality and placement.  A caller, Nate, commented on the gay and funny aspects of the audio, prompting further sexually explicit commentary from the hosts. The overall tone remained highly suggestive and vulgar, centered on the graphic details of the sexual act.

[00:00:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you very much.  Do you think you mention some things that might happen? 
[00:04:00]  Some people are really fucking stupid.  You're listening to the worst.  The worst.  You're listening to the worst.  Not the best.  All of it is so bad, it's hard to tell which is the worst.  The absolute worst.  And you're listening to the worst.  And you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony's.  The worst of Opie and Anthony's.  It's absolutely awful.  We're Steve.  We need the back story on this.  Steve, get in here.  On this audio.  Mom loses it on son.  The video is up on opianthony.com, but you can't really see anything because it's just a video camera that was left. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah, the audio, this woman just sounds miserable.  Well, we could start it as Steve makes his way into the studio.  Listen to this lady.  Lady.  Why are you doing this shit?  All I said was ask me.  No, you're not fucking me up, Kalen.  Give me your fucking card so I can use it.  Ask me nicely.  No.  Why can't you ask me nicely?  Stick it up your fucking ass.  I asked you nicely.  10 minutes ago, no, I didn't know. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, no, you've got to be kidding me.  Steve, what's the story on this?  I guess it's a mother yelling at her son.  He left the camera rolling because he must know that she's prone to these outbursts.  This is great that these kids are just hanging their parents out to dry with these videos and recordings.  We have the one of the son that got picked up by the father, and the father's just yelling at him.  Still one of my favorite things.  Ends up on the Internet.  And now this raging lunatic woman yelling at her son. 
[00:05:30]  I'm going to defend her a little bit.  Why?  Well, you're not allowed to hit your kids anymore.  So what else are you going to do?  Scream like a lunatic?  Would your mom scream like that at you?  She would give you a shoe across the face, and then guess what?  End of discussion.  No, there were a couple of times my mother just would, like, go off like a lunatic like this.  But then she would get so upset, she would bite her hand.  She would go, oh!  She would put her, like, and it was, like, completely straight. 
[00:06:00]  It wasn't like bite your knuckle.  Take your hand and put your fingers together, all together, and just hold it flat.  Okay.  Like, level with the ground.  And now put your index finger in your mouth and just go, oh!  She would do that.  Who's your mother?  Colin Quinn?  Exactly.  Colin.  I've seen Colin do that.  I do that, actually.  I bite the index finger really hard.  No more biting.  And then I bite in between my bicep and my shoulder muscle.  Why?  Right here in that soft spot. 
[00:06:30]  Where do you bite?  Really hard.  Why would you do that?  All right.  Relax.  No, no, I'm asking you.  Jesus.  What?  If you bite between your biceps, that is dangerous.  Why?  You can't.  Because a bicep is...  I didn't say bicep.  Did I?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Oh, I'll be the star of volume three.  Did I really say that one?  No, I didn't even catch that one.  Yeah, you did.  All right.  Bicep.  Of course, Danny Dixon caught it.  Oh, he already marked it down, those motherfuckers. 
[00:07:00]  They're working against us now in that room.  When he flexes like that, though, just when Oop is showing something, that bicep just comes  out.  All right.  Anyway.  Oh, this is not disturbing outside the studio.  Yeah, who is this guy?  He's a guy that, he came in looking like Crocodile Dundee.  He wants to hand out flyers in Times Square.  I ain't got time to bleed.  We can't get the hot chicks to do it, but we'll get this maniac.  Oh, we got this maniac.  That is a very printed out something.  Oh, thank you very much.  He's holding it up.  It says, happy birthday.  Jim Norton.  Jimmy.  Thank you.  Hopey and Anthony on the back.  Okay.  Back to the mom losing it on the set. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, right.  So your mom would freak out a little bit, Ant.  Yeah, she would freak out, but yeah, she tried hitting me, but it just didn't work  out.  Like, my father used to hit me, and then when he moved to California, the hitting just  stopped, because she hit me once when I was a little kid, and the strap, the tip of  the strap hit the tip of my penis, and it swelled up, and I had to put ice on it, and  she never hit me with the strap again.  Yeah.  That's terrific. 
[00:08:00]  That's terrific.  Are you serious?  Yeah, I was trying to get out of the way.  Like, I ran to the bunk bed, and I'd always run to the bottom bunk, because it's hard  to swing the strap in there, you know?  But she kind of went to swing it, kind of sidearm to get in there, and the tip of the  strap went right around my waist, and the tip of the strap hit the very tip of my little  wiener.  How do you ice down that area? 
[00:08:30]  And I jumped up like a chicken without a head.  I was screaming bloody murder in my room, grabbing, going, ah!  And my mother flipped out.  She lost her mind.  She thought she killed me.  Did you feel ashamed?  She threw it, of course, afterwards.  Dirty.  Of course.  And she was like, what did I do?  She freaked out.  And then got some ice and told me to put the ice on it.  So I put ice on it, and that was the last time she ever tried to hit me.  You should have made her put the ice on it.  Yeah, you put the ice on it. 
[00:09:00]  You don't stop my mom from spanking me, because I used to get hit, too.  One time she put me over her knee, she took a paddle, and then she swatted me.  I came on her leg.  Show her.  All right, back to the audio.  And I know I can all fucking tear this room apart and fucking find it.  You'll be one sorry, kid.  I don't have time.  I've got to get back to work.  Do you like one second?  Ask me nicely.  Fucking bastard.  You hear him?  Ask me nicely.  Ask me nicely.  Okay, the kid's being a prick. 
[00:09:30]  Of course, because he knows he's got gold for his friends.  The mother is a witch, though.  And this is why I go back to the, you know, she's not going to hit him.  He knows that.  So now he's like, oh, I'm going to tape this for my friends.  And then he knows what buttons to push.  Yeah, but you know why I can't sympathize with her?  Because you know she uses the same tactic with the husband, boyfriend, whatever it is.  Aren't there references to this?  Aren't there references to, like, child support made in this?  Oh, really?  Okay.  I didn't hear that. 
[00:10:00]  If you look at the footage, you will see, like, an Xbox and TV and a lot of electronics.  And he's obviously got his own camcorder, so he's recording this.  So he might be a relatively, you know, spoiled kid who knows how to push his mom's buttons.  And his mom's...  As soon as I heard this, I said, divorcee.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No doubt in my mind.  No doubt.  Todd, I've got to get back to work!  You got one second!  Ask me nicely.  Fucking bastard.  Fucking racist.  Fucking Rosa.  Fucking car. 
[00:10:30]  Give me that goddamn car now!  Who the...  What car is she looking for?  I guess she's looking for a credit card for the gas.  I bet you it's a credit card.  I bet you it's a credit card.  I think she said she ought to get gas to go to work.  And, uh, it's probably a credit card.  So just use cash.  For all you know, it's her credit card.  If you can't imagine standing there and having that yelling at you during an argument, I'd be in prison.  You'd have to kill that to make it stop.  Whew. 
[00:11:00]  Fucking Rosa.  Fucking car.  Give me that goddamn car now!  Ask me nicely.  Fuck off, you bastard.  Fuck off!  Get the fuck out of my house!  No, now you're getting on.  Get out of my fucking house!  No, that...  You!  No.  You pay the fucking bills!  I can't get my ass to work!  You get out and pay these fucking bills!  That ass nicely.  Fuck off!  You're all fucking head games, you're all 16-year-old piece of shit! 
[00:11:30]  You better be fucking out of my house and I'd be home for work today at 11 o'clock.  Because if you're fucking in here, you're getting up and you're getting their fucking ass, honey.  I'll call child support and you can go fuck yourself.  You can call your fucking father and we'll live with him.  How about that, you little son of a bitch?  Oh, okay, he said, I'll call child support.  He probably meant child welfare, child services.  Threatening her.  And then call your father, okay, so they don't live together. 
[00:12:00]  There's problems there.  Wow.  You can call your fucking father and we'll live with him.  How about that, you little son of a bitch?  Go away.  You just turned this whole fucking 15-minute goddamn conversation into the whole fucking pizza shit!  No, I asked you to ask nicely.  Fuck off!  No.  I asked you nicely when I came in here!  You little jerk-off!  Oh, well.  You little head game spoiled rotten brat!  You're going to fucking learn about life real fucking quick!  You should learn about life real quick.  Because your fucking bills won't be paid, Mr. Man! 
[00:12:30]  Never mind.  Mr. Man!  That fucking car!  No!  I have to go to work!  Well, I don't care now because you were a bitch.  You come here to threaten me out.  You know what?  Forget it.  Get out.  Go away.  You're not getting it now.  You should have asked nicely.  See, this shows our age, I got to tell you, because I can't even, I can't even imagine  getting in my mom's face like this.  I can't even, on any level, imagine it.  That's not a mother-son relationship right there.  That's like a...  But I think it shows our age.  I think this is going on a lot more than we realize. 
[00:13:00]  Really?  I think so, man.  I think Ope's right.  There's a whole generation of kids that are raised with the concept of the time-out.  There's no more beatings.  There's just, you know, you get a time-out, so you've got to thrash these little bastards.  I see some of the little kids in my family, and they get a time-out, and you see it in  their eyes like, whatever.  This is nothing.  Time-out.  Ooh, I'll sit in another room for a little while.  I'm going to stand on my head.  To make you happy.  You know?  And I understand.  I'm not questioning parenting.  It's what is going on these days, like Steve said.  The threat of the smack, the belt. 
[00:13:30]  Well, you brought up a good point.  Like, when you and Joe would act up, your dad would come to the bedroom and just, what,  leave the belt?  Hang the belt on the doorknob.  First, there were threats yelled from the living room.  And then if we didn't quiet down and go to sleep, because we'd be yapping, and they'd  hear us.  And he'd be like, shut up in there!  Go to sleep!  And you're trying to go to sleep, and then you start talking more.  And then he goes, don't make me get the belt.  And he would take his belt off and hang it on the doorknob. 
[00:14:00]  And if we were yapping too much, he'd come in.  He never actually did it.  I think that was just the threat.  We got hit with the belt, but it was for, like, real stuff more than just talking.  But the threat of that thing hanging on the doorknob like that, it was just the constant  reminder, like a hangman's noose.  And then we shut up.  We talk about it on the show a lot.  It's the fear.  Yeah.  It's not necessarily something actually happening.  They put the fear in you.  They get the fear in you.  And we knew what that belt felt like, because we had been hit with it.  Exactly.  So just the threat of it was enough to contain us. 
[00:14:30]  But it wasn't an idle threat.  You knew what it felt like to get whacked with that thing.  You know, you ever get shoved down the steps.  You ever get knocked.  You know, you ever get rattled a couple times.  If I ever turned around to my mother or father, ever went, hey, fuck you, ask nice, I couldn't  tell you the mess I would have been.  It's got to be a generation thing.  It's got to be.  I can't imagine growing up doing this to my parents.  I would lose an eye.  I would say crap or something as a kid, and my father would just, you know, whoosh. 
[00:15:00]  What?  What's that language?  You don't fucking use that.  You don't fucking use that kind of fucking language in this fucking house, you shithead.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, let's go to Rick in Indiana.  Rick?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Happy birthday there, sweet tits.  You guys got to do a comparison.  Thank you.  Between that bitch on the radio and the South Park chick that drives the school bus, that's  the funniest shit I ever heard.  She's her, man.  Oh, Mrs. Crabtree, right? 
[00:15:30]  You got it.  Do a comparison.  It's her, dude.  Yeah, a bunch of people calling in with that.  Very good.  Excellent.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you, sir.  Let's say hi to Chris in New Jersey.  Chris, what's going on?  You know, my kid, when I first brought up my kid, we did the timeout thing, and it didn't  work.  Just like you were saying, he just looked at me.  And then it got to the point where finally I took his notebook and smashed it out of his  hands, literally drop-kicked it out of his hands, pushed him up against the wall and 
[00:16:00]  said, that is enough.  He immediately turned into a normal human being and never had a single problem with  him since.  Now he's a fabulous, fabulous kid.  Yeah, they're just raising him differently these days.  Yeah, I think it's bullshit.  That's why I hate the left.  Yeah, absolutely.  They treat their kids like their kids are their betters.  It's ridiculous.  And no Corey on instant feedback. 
[00:16:30]  My mom never threatened to have Joe Klecko hit me.  No, man, one good split kick, and they get it a lot.  Yeah, idiot.  Everyone knows it was Mookie Wilson.  All right, guys.  Punching out.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Joe Klecko.  Jesus.  All right, uh, yeah, back to the audio here.  Hang in there, Steve.  Hey, that fucking car!  No!  I have to go to work!  No, I don't care now, because you were a bitch.  You come here and threaten me out.  You know what?  Forget it. 
[00:17:00]  Get out.  Go away.  You're not getting it now.  You should have asked nicely.  Oh, you didn't slam it that time.  Well, you had to slam something else.  You're in my fucking house!  You'll follow my fucking rules!  You're grounded!  Tell me!  Don't fucking go to work!  Don't fucking go to get it!  If you are fucking found in these areas, I'm going to fucking run down there and take your ass out there!  I'm going to work.  Do you not?  Do you not? 
[00:17:30]  Yes, I am.  Oh, I don't even try to achieve this, man.  Don't even go to your goddamn employer and tell you, Galen!  Good for you, you little lazy fucking sassy!  You seem a sassy to you!  Wow.  Anthony, I got a question for you.  You're pretty good at this.  Yeah.  How do you think the marriage ended?  Wow.  Yeah, that was...  How would you live with a woman like that?  I don't know.  I mean, I understand the kid is driven out of this, obviously.  I bet you.  But she's handling this completely wrong.  The kid is probably reacting much in the same way the father reacted. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, probably just, hey, whatever, no, now I'm not going to do it.  Yeah, this kid probably learned from the master.  I learned it from you, okay?  Whenever mom starts getting like this, just going to, hey, whatever, should I ask nice,  and just let her go off like this, like a lunatic.  She should just be bludgeoning him with something, just any weapon in that room, beating him  with his own PlayStation.  I would take his Little League trophy that he got when he was eight years old. 
[00:18:30]  And just beat him with it.  Just beat the shit out of him.  Just beat him.  She should be smashing his Xbox, just smash it in front of his face.  You know, the little...  There you go.  That gets results.  You know, the Little League trophy that everyone gets, because there's no winners or losers.  No winners or losers.  Everyone's a winner.  Everyone's a winner.  That's great.  Oh, is she...  Oh.  You know, I almost feel sorry for her, that she is in this position where she has to be,  has to get herself like this.  She knows she can't hit him, because if there is a divorce situation, there's always the threat 
[00:19:00]  that this little smartass might call Divez or child services.  Oh, he probably would, yeah.  Or the cops.  So she's frustrated that she can't actually discipline, because he might call his father,  or something like that.  There's all these other avenues.  Oh, she's just fucked.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's screwed.  Anyway, you look at it, she's just fucked.  She's in a situation that she's got herself into.  She's a raving lunatic, but she's screwed.  And she's screwed, yeah.  You're a fucking little piece of shit, you know that?  That's exactly what you are! 
[00:19:30]  Go away.  Fucking son of a fucking bitch.  Can't even fucking let me get $50,000!  You're a fucking ass nicely up to your fucking ass, you little spoiled rotten prick!

[00:27:30]  You can hear him  We got it  I'll get the rest of it  Yeah we can't leave the fine listeners just hanging  There's a part two to that Anthony  Nice  And we really should try to clean that up for TV  Not a bad idea at all  Wonderful  Let's see  Dad beat him with wiffle ball  Irony  She called him son of a bitch  I agree  Yeah  He agreed with it  Let's see  Wow  Listen to this  Shwuggy  Hey Shwuggy  What's up?  Hey guys  How you doing? 
[00:28:00]  How you doing?  How you doing?  Good morning  Anthony you're talking about hitting your father or being scared of him  I remember when I was 12 and my father was just smacking me around for something I fucked up  And I was a man and I said screw and I smacked him  Uh oh  To this day I can still remember the fire in his eyes  And me just running to my room and just barricading the door  But that's when everything changes though right?  Not at 12  No not at 12  Not at 12  Not at 12 okay  But what was worse was he left  He just didn't 
[00:28:30]  It was one of those things where he held a grudge  And just remembered until the next time I fucked up  I know it sucks you're 12  It's not like you can pack your little  Your little  Your stuff  And throw it on the end of a stick  And go  Go run away somewhere  Well you know  You know what's really funny  Sometimes the balance shifts  Because I remember I was about 20 or 21  And I was in tip top physical shape at the time  Working out twice a day  And I remember just mouthing both of my father or something like that  He's like I can still knock you on your ass  And my father was like 62  100 pounds overweight  And I  Oh knock you on your ass kid 
[00:29:00]  Exactly  Exactly  But when it gets to that point it's just damn depressing  No you're right  You don't  Well there's a whole thing that goes on  When you reach the point where you are old enough and strong enough to take your dad  You're on  You should be on terms with him where you would never think of doing that  Oh no I remember him saying that to me and me just saying come on let's go  Jokingly  Yeah  And my mom was like yeah I want to see this too  You know of course not  But it's just sad because we'll all be at that spot at one point  Well not you guys but I will be  So  I have two little girls 
[00:29:30]  And who I do slap on the tushy every once in a while  And they just don't care  I mean it's just amazing  Every time you hit them they're closer to the pole  Closer to putting that wrap in the leg around the pole  And doing circles around it  I don't say that  Alright punch down  And they develop that smack move  Yeah they do the smack  And they remember when they were a kid  When I was a kid I remember stealing quarters from my father  Stealing quarters from his bedroom  Buy something  I don't even remember what the hell it was 
[00:30:00]  But he found out and  That wasn't good  I got wrapped right across the face  Open hand  Big man mitt  Whap right across my face  There's a few things that happen  And you know something  Again  You just never  I never took the quarters again  That was it  But there's a few things that happen  You know you do get to an age  If you're in that situation  Where you do get hit or whatever  And you finally you know stand up to the person  Yeah  Your parents  And then it's never the same after that  Right  And that's kind of sad  Because then you realize that 
[00:30:30]  You sort of have the upper hand  Yeah a little bit  Which is kind of weird  When you're like  You're a kid and you've got parents  And then the other thing is like  It brings back a weird memory for me  You know  When you're a kid  You're always competing with your father in a way  You know name it  Like in my house  It was basketball right  And my dad would play me  Because I was into  You know playing basketball and stuff  And we'd have like  Foul shooting contests and stuff  Yeah  It was you know  A dad and son thing to do  You know  And I  You're going to squirt  And I'd be struggling 
[00:31:00]  And let's say I'd make  I don't know  Six out of ten free throws let's say  And then it's dad's turn  And then you know  He makes like you know  Five  He's five for eight let's say  And then as a kid  You know  It starts where you  You don't realize that he's allowing you to win  Uh huh  You know so  You know he misses obviously the last two  And he gets five out of ten  And you win  Yeah  And then it gets to a point  Where then you notice  That he's purposely letting you win  Right  Right  And that starts to be a bummer  And then it gets to the stage 
[00:31:30]  Where there's no letting winning  Letting uh the son win anymore  Now the father's trying his balls off  To still beat you  To beat you  Yeah  And then you know  That you're now officially quote  Better than him as far as that little thing goes  Right  That little competition  And when that happens  It's kind of a drag too  You're like oh  I remember something like that too  Because I was able  Shooting or something right  No it was uh  You know  I wasn't able to drink  A case of beer  But then as I got older 
[00:32:00]  I was able to drink more  Than uh my father  And uh  You're not even making a joke  Sometimes I'd spot him a few beers  No  You never know with you though  There was drinking  And effing  And horse riding  Shooting  Jesus  Yeah  You weren't being raised at all  When you were in California  Nah it was like camp  But it's kind of a  It's a weird thing when you're growing up  When it finally hits that level  Where now you realize that  You sort of got the upper hand  On your parents  Yeah  You know no matter what it is  It's just a little  It's a little strange  Uh  Toolbag is saying  Never underestimate old man strength though 
[00:32:30]  It's uh  The only thing that comes close  To retard strength  Like your  Your father's strength  He'll give it his all  If he uh  Feels you're gonna get the upper hand  Yeah  I never appreciated that whole  You know  Fighting your father thing  Nah  It's a little odd  That is beyond odd  Uh  Then we're right up to  Oh  I  I  Ever  Oh  It should have been  Never  I never spoke to either one of my parents this way  I would have uh  Woken up to Christmas music  Bush killed Jim 
[00:33:00]  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah the whole thing  Talking back to your parents like that  No way  Would have been over  All right  Let me see what uh  Jackson has in Florida  Are you in Jacksonville?  No  No I'm Jackson  My name is Jackson  I live in Florida  Ah  Uh  How you doing guys  All right  What's up  Yeah  My  My ex-wife is in the same situation  As this  As this lady was  She doesn't scream like that  When we still get along real good  But my 14 year old  Tried that  Talking back  Getting really nasty with her 
[00:33:30]  Called her a bitch  Wouldn't let her  Wouldn't let her  She wouldn't let him  Spend the night  At a friend's house  Because  You know  He'd gotten two F's on his report card  All this stuff  So  She called me up  What do I do  I said  Let him go  And uh  She's like  You know  What are you talking about  I said  Just let him go  Trust me on this  Let him go  So she  And I said  We're gonna  We're gonna fix his little red wagon  While he's gone  And after he  He was gone for the weekend  I went over there  We moved  All his  Xbox  Playstation  Television  Everything  Out of his room  Literally cleaned it out  Empty  Ripped the carpet off the floors 
[00:34:00]  Down to the concrete  I bought a cot  And put a cot in there  With a pillow  And took the door  Off the hinges  And that's what he came home to  And the thing that upset him the most  Was the fact that the door  Was off the hinges  So now he has  No privacy  Whatsoever  Zero privacy  And no possessions  We took all of his clothes  Went to Walmart  And bought  Dickie's pants  And white button down shirts  And said  There  Deal with that  You little bastard  And he 
[00:34:30]  We made him live like that  For a month  And have never had a problem  With him since  Wow you're a sick one man  That's nice  But it worked  It worked  You can't beat him  I mean if it was up to me  I'd have to put my boot in his ass  But you can't do it  Right  Now they will  Call the cops  It's happened to friends of mine  Right  Wow  You know  I had a good friend of mine  Nice guy  Great guy  Goes to my church  Christian guy  And he ended up  Locked up overnight  For beating his kid  Wow  So that's what I decided to do  And taking the door  Off the hinges 
[00:35:00]  It killed him  He couldn't go in his room  Yeah that's their privacy  Slam the door  And  Gone  Very good sir  In their own domain  A lot of people asking  If this kid in the audio  Is a stepchild  No way  No way right  No it doesn't sound like it  Let's say hi to James  In Oklahoma  James  Yeah  Hey guys  Good morning to you  And someone else  Is bringing up a point  On the instant feedback  And the phones now  The mother wants to  Borrow his money  In that clip  Yeah  I didn't pick up on that 
[00:35:30]  Yeah that is odd  James go ahead  Well I had a stepmother  That was just like that  But I never talked to her  That way  Because I knew  What was coming  So 20 years later  I become a cop  Here in Oklahoma  And I go to these  Little kids houses  That are acting like this  What do I do  I tell the parents  I say spank them  They take their belt off  And I'll stand there  And watch them  Spank their child  That way  They can't come up  With this  Hey I'm calling  Child Protective Services 
[00:36:00]  I'm calling the cops  The cops are here  And I tell the parents  Hey if you're going to  If you're going to  Spank your child  You spank your child  Get it over with  Right now  And maybe you won't  Have these problems  Later on in life  I tell them  Hey if you need some help  I will hold them down  And it works  You're setting yourself up  For a lawsuit sir  Unfortunately  No  No no lawsuit  Because I'm not  Doing anything wrong  I'm making sure  The law  They're obeying the law  Yeah  And disciplining their child  Yeah  And it's not child abuse  Right  Wow 
[00:36:30]  Okay  Thank you James  Hey thanks guys  There he goes  James in Oklahoma  We have the other audio  Do you have that  I think everybody's  You know everybody's different  All kids are different  So if some of them  You can do that whole  Sit down  Take a time out thing  That's fine  But I think this  If the time out thing  Isn't working  And you could probably  See that pretty early on  Then you gotta resort  To plan B  It'd be nice to be  The person that like  Oh I don't have to  Hit my kids  Or I don't hit my kids 
[00:37:00]  Or something like that  But you know  And I'm talking to my ass  Because I don't have kids  But it just seems to me  Like if the time out thing  Isn't working  And you're raising  A little terror  It might be time  To get a little thing  Because it's more  It's more about  The whole fear of it  Than it is the actual pain  From getting whacked  You're not hitting them  So they're in pain  It's just kind of a  You know  Wake her up her  It's like a surprise  Yeah because  You're fucking hitting me  Who wants to go through that  Yeah  Except a little Jimmy Norton  Of course  We got some audio  Of the Boston Father  We've played this 
[00:37:30]  Oh yeah  Well we've played it once  Well maybe on the replay  You've heard it a couple times  And Danny's running in  With part two  Of the audio of this chick  Oh  We can save the Boston Father  Audio then  Here's part two  Of uh  The lady yelling at her son  Looking for just money  I guess  You shouldn't have asked nicely  Oh wow  Sit here call me all this shit 
[00:38:00]  And you expect me to help you  Why in the hell  Should I help you  After all you just did  Oh she was losing her mind  And you can't ask me nicely  You have to sit here  And call me names  Lend your mom 50 bucks  Lend your mom 50 bucks  Why  Because she's broke 
[00:38:30]  Okay so now here's the neighbor  Like Danny explained  Danny  The neighbor comes in  To try to get this kid  To lend the mom 50 bucks  Fitty  Where's this kid getting the money from  Maybe dad  Yeah  Alright here comes the neighbor  Call me names  Lend your mom 50 bucks  Why  Because she's broke  She's being a complete bitch  Because she's broke  But she's being a bitch  Look at this  Like look at  Do you want to live here  Do you want to live here 
[00:39:00]  No I'm not going to be living here soon  But that is complete bullshit  You don't treat somebody like that  And expect to get them to help you  Like  The whole point is  Danny  Your mom's got to get to work  And she's asking you  To lend her 50 bucks  If you can't do it  Then you know  She's like  She's been here  Fucking supporting you guys  For over fucking 16 years  Another scenario  You move into the neighborhood  And you meet the old neighbor  Hey neighbor  Hey  Howdy neighbor 
[00:39:30]  Maybe you invite him over  To a barbecue or something  Yeah  Now he's in the middle of this crap  Now he's  Yeah  Now he's got to deal with this  Started with a warm apple pie  And now you're talking to her son  Oh  After hearing her screeching all morning  Fucking supporting you guys  For over fucking 16 years  Yeah  She's been caring about you guys  For 16 years  Like what the hell is that  You got to understand one thing  That's not how you treat your children  She's  She's been treating you  Better than you've ever been treated  In your entire lifetime  No she hasn't 
[00:40:00]  You got to understand  It's fucking you know  This isn't easy for her  This is very fucking difficult  And this  Very difficult  This is acceptable  You guys aren't helping  This is not acceptable  Under any standards  Ever  That's not the point  Is help your mom  Help my mom  So she can act like this  So we can live in a house  And if you're helping your mom  She wouldn't be acting like this  She acts like this  No matter what  Okay  That's the way it is  Because you guys don't  Help out around the house  Even when we do help 
[00:40:30]  And she is guys  You guys got to wake up man  This is the real world  She needs to wake up a bit too  It's not teachers and cream out there  Well she doesn't get to treat people like that  And expect them to help her  Help her out  Please  She sits here and swears at me  I hate everything about you  What the hell is that  I'm asking you nicely  And I'm asking you  Fucking  Please help her out  I'll pay you back  I don't give a shit  Just fucking  Please help her out  Okay I will  As long as I get my $50  Yeah  Yeah you'll get it back  Okay  Oh looks like it's gonna be okay Anthony

[00:43:30]  Is what it is  Who she hates for probably leaving her  And every time she looks at the kid  She sees the ex-husband  You can hear it in his voice  Yeah  He's kind of like a beaten kid  Yeah  He's just like  You know he's a wise ass obviously  He was  Yeah  But you also hear it in his voice  Like this really is a bummer  She really  This  This just  Stinks my mother's insane  That's an unhealthy relationship they have there  I think they need help  Wow  Alright let's say hi to Steve  That's really going to also help him out 
[00:44:00]  In his relationships in the future I believe  You know what it's going to be like  When he's out there  Looking for  A girlfriend  Future wife perhaps  Steve  Yeah  Hey  Hey  Out in California  You know how liberal they are  I have daughters  In an ex situation  And when I got custody  I asked the child support worker  And the  My case worker  And custody worker  Because I  I put them in a system  To where they come out 
[00:44:30]  To my house  And visit  So my ex-wife  Can't say  I abused my children  What the definition of  Abusing your child was  And they said  As long as  You can hate the child  Open handed  By law  Two or three times  And as long as you don't go  More than that  It's not considered abuse  That's a little weird huh  That's California  So you figure  If California is a liberal state  That way  How are other states seeing it  That's all I got  Punching out  Alright thank you 
[00:45:00]  Let's go to Timmy in Wisconsin  Timmy  Hey man  What's up  My mother would scream  Exactly like that  Oh you're kidding  She would actually  Put a butcher knife  To her throat  And say  I'll do it  I'll fucking do it  Are you kidding me  Her own throat  She would lock herself  In the bathroom  Screaming from the bathroom  I'll do it  And she'd be  Slashing furniture with it  Wow that's really crazy  I kept the knife  For like over a year  With like  Dentsol in it  And then it happened again 
[00:45:30]  Like a year later  And I brought it out  And my dad  Grabbed it from me  He's like  This shouldn't be around here  He's afraid  Like the wrong person  Would see it  And mommy would be  Put away in a straitjacket  What does she do now?  Sit at home  And watches TV  Yeah  Do you have a relationship  With her?  Yeah  Well it was mostly  Because like my dad  Was drinking  And when my dad  Quit drinking  Then she got really bad  Yeah  But then  After like a year  It calmed down  And she's pretty cool now  You goof on her about it? 
[00:46:00]  Well  No not now  I mean  Because we goof on my mother  All the time  About how she used to be crazy  Yeah  She was insane  With cleaning the house  We would wake up  Saturday mornings  And my mother would be like  It didn't matter  You know  I guess we're  I don't know  Twelve  Something like that  Who even knows  But she'd wake us up  Come on get up  This place looks like  A fucking bomb hit it  Get  And you know meanwhile  I'm just thinking  You know  A few years later  You start thinking  Oh I get it  Clean the house  Make sure it's clean 
[00:46:30]  You know  There's some issues there mommy  Well you're not alone  With that one though  Yeah  I think a lot of people  Could relate to that one  But we were all like  You know  You know  This one's dusting  This one's vacuuming  The house  And she was just  You know  Get under  What is this  Pick that up  Just crazy  And then the phone would ring  And she'd pick it up  And be like  And don't  Make sure you get under the couch  How the hell are ya  Hot yeah  Oh nothing  We're just sitting around  So we would clean up  So quickly  While she was on the phone  So then we could walk up to her 
[00:47:00]  As she's on the phone  And go  I'm gonna go outside  I'm gonna go outside  And she would kind of do that  Not even look at you  But wave the hand  Like okay  Alright  And then you were out of the house  When that phone rang  We would  Because we'd be going nuts  You'd be with all your cleaning tools  And the phone would ring  And I cannot tell you the relief  That would come over  Three kids  Just from a phone ringing  Because you knew  You weren't being yelled at  As you're cleaning  She was crazy  But now  You know  We're sitting around  And she's a pisser now  And we'd just sit around

[00:57:30]  The dream of doing what you're doing  Being on a huge tour  And you know  That seems to be what you get together for when you're younger  Absolutely  Younger  And then you finally get  Then you get there  And you're  Brilliant  And then you get there and you're like  Fuck  Yeah you realize you had to sell your soul to Beelzebub  You know  Yeah you have your idea of what it's going to all be about  And then yeah  You have to sign a few contracts with some businessmen  Things you never wanted to do  Totally  Well you guys are going on  Like right you're on the main stage 
[00:58:00]  You're going right before Maiden and Sabbath  I mean that's got to be phenomenal as a band  To be working with those two bands  Absolutely  Did you get a picture with Sabbath?  No  No  I'm such a fucking stalker  I get photos of everybody  Jimmy's all about the celebrity photos  I fucking  Do they get a photo together?  Are they ever together at any other point other than  In Sabbath Village maybe you'll see them  That little area where the trailers are  Oh I doubt that  No  I stare at Bill Ward for 45 minutes  Until he fucking finally took a picture with me  He was just warming up on his drums  And I just sat there and stared at him  Wait those guys don't want to be together at all?  You think  I didn't say that  I just 
[00:58:30]  You just haven't seen them together  I just  I would  You know  I think it would be  It would be easy to presume that  They probably don't  Get together at any other time  Really?  Than being on stage  Just on stage and then  Bill's really cool  Yeah he's great  He's super approachable  Just a cool guy  Hangs out  Like he's up on the deck during the day  Just tweaking on his drums  Saying hey to everybody  I annoyed Geezer and Iommi  Like fucking kind of stalking him  Out to the tour bus  And I think I scared Geezer back out of the bus  That kind of does  Annoy people  Yeah  I can't help it  I didn't really stalk him 
[00:59:00]  I just kind of stood there  But fuck him  What were we talking about?  We were talking about why I hate touring?  Yeah  Yeah  Okay  Oh that'll do it huh?  What the stalkers?  Well I mean  I'm sure that's one reason  Fans  Stalkers  Yeah  What do they annoy the shit out of you though?  Always asking for something  Pictures  Autographs  That's kind of big  I guess you know what  If they'd ask  That might be alright  But you know  People running up to you  And sticking a camera in your face  You know  Really?  Yeah  Totally  That sucks  Oh yeah totally  But that's kind of  And they would say 
[00:59:30]  That's kind of hey  You know  You wanted to  This lifestyle of the rock star  Kind of thing  Is kind of the position  You put yourself in  You're going to have to deal with it  Hmm  No huh?  Yeah  You don't see it that way?  No  Well how do you see it then?  I play drums  Yeah  That's all I do  That's all I ever signed up for  Playing drums  And the rest of this stuff  Just annoys the hell out of you  Just you know  He didn't say on the resume  Be a professional model  You know  Right  Also  Yeah  Didn't see that one coming  Would you rather work for a living? 
[01:00:00]  What's that?  Would you rather work for a living  Like a real job?  I am working for a living  Come on  No I know  I know  Like  I got to come in and go to work every morning  But  Believe me  This isn't work  I worked at some point in my life  You know  I actually was in construction for a while  I ran my own custodial business  See  That's what I mean by working for a living  Obviously you work hard  Playing and  You know  Doing what you do  We keep crazy hours  Absolutely  But  Would you rather be  18 hour video shoots  Right 
[01:00:30]  Would you rather be installing  You know  Drywall or something  You know  You wouldn't have anybody bothering you  He's done it  Yeah  I've done it actually  Yeah  Yeah  That doesn't  It's  That  No I'm thinking once this  Rockstar thing is done  I'm going to go back to school  And get an art history degree  Really  Absolutely  I'm working in a museum  That's it  That's it  Curator  I don't mean to laugh  Back to the drywall  Yeah  Back to the drywall  I want to be a tour guide  Yeah  Yeah  Absolutely  Maybe at the Wadsworth Thothenium 
[01:01:00]  In Hotsworth Connecticut  That would be hot  Because you're such a people person  I am  I am  But you know what  You're really coming  But you know what  Hold on  Hold on  If you're  If you're taking somebody on a museum tour  You don't really have to be nice to anybody  All you have to do is walk around  And tell the people what they're looking at  Hey  The people that work in museums  You know that's  That's P.A. Mondrian over there  They're assholes  It was done in 1931  Just hope nobody wants to  Right when he went into his boogie woogie phase  Just hope that no one wants to take your picture  In front of the chart close  Why would anybody want to take my picture  If I'm a museum tour guy 
[01:01:30]  You know just so they can  Who would care  So they can show the power of the photorealism  Oh  Well I would be game for that  You know  Still got to be something phenomenal  This is the difference between comics and rock people  It's just got to be  To get blown on a bus  Has got to be the fucking greatest thing ever  Blow  What  Blow what  To get blown  You ever been blown on a bus  Never have I been blown on a bus  He just did a big gig in Cleveland  He got nothing  Two shows  It doesn't matter  Two sold out theater shows  And he got nothing after the shows  I'm not actually sure what we're talking about 
[01:02:00]  Getting a blow job on a bus  By a hot groupie girl  Oh  Yeah  I'm  Huh  See once again  We've fallen into those rock cliches  And expectations  Of what being in a band and touring is about  Interesting  We must all live vicariously through you rock stars  What can we say  Yeah  Well what is going on on the rock bus  Uh reading  Everyone assumes there's a lot of drugs and drinking  And naked girls  You tell us  What is on the  Not on the mud vein bus  Uh no  Well what's on the rock bus  Drinking obviously 
[01:02:30]  Alright so the drinking is  And maybe occasional drugs  Alright so we got the drugs right  Got a Philip K. Dick book right now  Really  Reading valis  Yeah  You get a lot of reading  Yeah  Wow  That really does  Kind of part ways from the  From the naked chicks  All these  Yeah all these  No naked chicks whatsoever  We're crazy to think that I guess  Yeah the booze and the drugs are accurate  But the chicks  You're probably turning them down  That's why you're not  You probably  I don't know if you're married  Do you have a girl  Maybe you're just going  No I don't want to fuck around the road  Too risky  Okay so you don't want to fuck around the road 
[01:03:00]  But you probably could if you wanted to  Actually probably not  Girls don't really like mud vein very much  No  We could probably get as many  12 to 14 year old pimply faced boys  That we want right Chad  Oof  Even better  Sure  Sure  All right let's say hi to Mike  He has a question for you guys  Mike what's going on  Hello  Go ahead Mike  Hey question for you  You're giving a little Jimmy shit  About wanting to take pictures of stars  How do you feel about the people  Who are spending their hard money 
[01:03:30]  To go out and buy your damn album  And not willing to give them  A couple seconds to return  I don't think he was giving people shit  About getting pictures  He was just saying he wanted them to ask  Like just say hey can I get a picture  It's not one of your favorite things to do  Is what you're saying  No I didn't say  I didn't say we don't  Do pictures with people  We do pictures with people every day  And I think what we were mentioning about  Were the stalkers  The people that come out of nowhere  And flash pictures at you  And you don't even know they're there  And they don't even approach you  And introduce themselves  Yeah  All right let's say hi to BJ  Not liking that  BJ what's up  Not much 
[01:04:00]  Hey Mudvin how you doing  What's up man  I just had a question about  The whole face paint  And the mask things that you used to do  How come you guys dropped that  Was it just something that  You outgrew  Got bored of  Who said we dropped it  When you started doing the alien faces  It kind of turned into a gimmick  And it was gay  Okay so he just answered his own question  There you go  We decided that it was just way too gay  And we were just  Get out of it  You know it was just a gaytrocity  Let's go to Frank in New York City

Hey  Couldn't be better  I'm like the other guy  I was kind of  I'm happy with my job  But it's just kind of aggravating  When you hear  When you hear a good band  That's been out  Popular 
[01:06:00]  Doing very well  That comes across  When the drummer says  You know I didn't sign up to do this  You know  I'm just here to drum  Dude actually you're here  You know  Your fans pay a lot of money  To come out  Harder than money  To come out  Buy your album  See you  The last thing they want to hear  Is you complaining  That it's the last thing  I want to do  I didn't sign up  To be a model  Alright  I file my official apology  I apologize  We were just having a little fun  I apologize  My condolences to everybody that works  I really appreciate people coming to the shows 
[01:06:30]  And it's an honor to be able to be playing NASFest right now  And we love it  You're definitely  I mean you're definitely still having fun doing this right?  Of course  Of course  That's why we do it  There you go  There you go  Let's go into some other things here  John in Iowa  What's up John?  Yeah I just wanted to say  You know I really like that new album  It's really good  The whole album's great  And it's been a long time since I've heard a real good rock album  But there's a song on there  It's got these freaky little voices  That go  Eeny meeny miny moe 
[01:07:00]  And I just wanted to know what was behind that maybe  And who did it  I don't know  I think the  Well the name of the song is Choices  Yeah the name of the song is Choices  And it's  The new CD's Lost and Found by the way  It's that game that every kid plays  You know  Eeny meeny miny moe  So  That's the idea behind it  Is making a choice  And  The  The people on it were  Our producer's children  Yeah it was Dave Orman's kids  He's got two daughters and a son that came in and did it 
[01:07:30]  Well you did it too with him  Absolutely  Yeah  Alright let's say hi to another Chad  Chad what's up  Hey  Chad you've got the coolest name on the planet  Yeah first off I can attest to the fact that Matt is a very very kind individual if you show him respect  Thank you I really appreciate you saying so  That's all we were trying to say  And you're going to say Chad's an asshole right  You know what I really appreciate you saying so  Yeah  Cause I enjoy meeting people and I enjoy making friends 
[01:08:00]  I just don't like being stalked  Oh yeah I completely understand  But I want to know what brought about the change between Lost and Found  And especially the second half of LD50  Was it just personal growth or  You know we keep an attitude with our creative process that we're not trying to recreate a moment  But we're trying to find out where the band is at the time that we're writing  So I mean I don't know if it's change or growth 
[01:08:30]  It's just you know life changes and life moves along  And you know the band's a different band than we were four years ago  People do get pissed off at that  And a lot they like to throw out the word sell out a lot whenever you do something  And they don't understand that a band is a group of guys that are  The longer you're together the more you're going to change  Your ideas change  The gel between the guys and everything  And you're going to be different  Why does it have to remain the same?  You don't want to keep writing the same record  No 
[01:09:00]  You know what I mean  You'll have just as many people pissed off at you  And if you're lucky enough  You want your music to be honest  I mean that's what we really really strive for  If you're lucky enough to be successful long enough  You'll have people crawling out of the woodwork saying  These motherfuckers man  They were great years back  And then now they've sold out  They've changed  You can't try to meet people's expectations  Nah  You know I mean  And I always felt like  If we were smart enough  Maybe we could have been a pop band  And you know we could second guess what people like to listen to  But I don't think we're quite that smart 
[01:09:30]  I think with us  You know what our fans have appreciated  Is just the honesty  You know we just try to make the most honest music we can  You uh  More lucky people like it  You read message boards or anything about it?  No  No?  You don't even touch them?  I want to do a  I want to do a Mudvayne haters message board  Yeah  On our site  Because  We already have one  Just to get one  Yeah  No that's the only one we have  That's the whole thing  Well whenever you have a lot of people with message boards  That for some reason  The people that are attracted to that 
[01:10:00]  Are the people that really just want to bash the shit out of you  Most people don't even have anything to say about Mudvayne  Really?  It's like  People just literally just talking  A lot of infighting  Yeah  Yeah  It's just a strange thing the message boards  And I do know that  Or at least I think  Anybody who has a message board dedicated to them  Or that they're involved with in some way shape or form  Does read  You go to it at some point  Have you ever read a post on a message board?  Uh-uh  You? 
[01:10:30]  On ours?  Yeah  Absolutely  Yeah  I haven't  I mean people tell me all the time  Yeah  Because that's odd that you wouldn't  Yeah  You know I just  A lot of people do  I don't know maybe I shouldn't say anything  Maybe I should just keep my mouth  You know dude if you were into your fans you'd read their fucking posts  I like this Mac guy  Matt you're alright  Thank you  I appreciate it  Right when the record  Right when the record came out  Yeah  Like just  Out of curiosity 
[01:11:00]  You wanted to see one  It's like  Whatever  Yeah  Like people not even talking about the record  I'm going  Chet  Yeah  You know  You want to get some feedback or something  Somebody say something about it  Yeah  Nothing  Go to Amazon.com and read all those posts  Like where you can buy the record  Oh yeah there you go  There you go  You might see something there  Are you guys all from Peoria?  No  We're all from different parts of central Illinois  Illinois  You're Richard Pryor fans?  Absolutely  I read that I was very happy 
[01:11:30]  I just watched  You're crazy the other day  Doesn't his son still live there?  I think he has a son that lives in Peoria  Really?  I mean I don't know any more than that  Let's say hi to Tim in Tennessee  Tim what's up?  Hey guys  Good morning the Man Mellons  Hey I was listening to those other callers  Whine about guys in the band  Not wanting to take pictures  And you know last time I checked  You buy a CD  You get the music on the CD  And that's what you're paying for  And if these guys don't want to take time  To do anything else 
[01:12:00]  Well that's too fucking bad  You know  That's not really what they said  Matt just doesn't like to be stalked  And you know  No no no  I actually agree  The guys in the band have every one  No I know he's agreeing  But he's also saying that  Yeah  The other calls were saying  You guys don't like it at all  That's not what  You know what  Every day we do  We do meet and greets and stuff  Every single day  We're doing  We're doing  150 people a day  At OzFest  Or whatever  Well you think about that  You know  If you do a minute per person 
[01:12:30]  That's 150 minutes  You guys don't have time to take a shit  So  You don't do a minute per person  I'm all for a free choice  Whatever you guys want to do  Just keep putting out good tunes  I appreciate that  Thank you  Seriously  Let's say hi to Rob on Long Island  Rob what's up?  What's going on guys  How you doing?  Great music guys  Me and my brother are big fans  I first saw you guys  At the Summer Sanitarium Tour  At Giant Stadium  A couple years back  But I wanted to ask  Where you guys got your name from  Because from what I hear  It's like a sling for asshole  I just wanted to know  If that's true  Wow  I often wondered about that 
[01:13:00]  That never occurred to me actually  After we threw that out there  Like years ago  I was thinking  Man I hope that people  Don't think that  Is that like an anal reference?  Yeah  That's an anal reference  Yeah sure is  Absolutely  Actually it came from  Have you ever heard of a fish  Called a carp?  Ever heard of that fish?  Yeah he's out but  Yeah  He's gone  Or whatever  And I was literally  Driving around the Decatur Dam  And I looked down  And I saw some people fishing  And I was like  I remembered fishing there  With my dad  Or whatever  And it was just like 
[01:13:30]  Really boring  And like no action  And no fishing  Basically you just sit there  With your wine in the water  And every once in a while  You catch a carp  And it'd be like  Woo  Got one on  Woo  You know  And you'd reel it in  And it'd be like  Oh it's a carp  You can't keep that one  And you throw it back  Because it's got a mud vein  So that's where I came up with it  You know what  I've never heard that story  That's the first time  I've heard that story  Yeah  I've never heard that  I thought it was  I thought it was the pink laser  Shot from the Sirius star system 
[01:14:00]  That sent the name  Like right  I burned it in my brain  The pink laser  I was driving around the dam  When the pink laser hit me  You were struck by the pink laser  From the Sirius star system  The dog star  The dog star  Let's go to the rich in Ohio  Rich what's up  Good morning boys  Little Jimmy  Hey what's up man  Yo Mudvay  You guys fucking tore it up Saturday  Awesome  Thank you  I saw you up at the Burgerstown  At the Post-Cazette Pavilion  And these motherfuckers  That say that you guys don't work  Apparently ain't never been to one of your shows  Thank you

[01:15:00]  Like as a singular moment  And it's a moment that the fans  And that we get to have  That's unlike any other  And every show is that  And it kind of  I think it keeps us pretty vital  And keeps us pretty excited about our shows  I mean we get  We get really excited about playing  That's what we do  Very good  Let's say hi to Dave in Queens  Dave  Yo what's going on  What's up Dave  What's up man  Nothing all fucking good  Yo I saw you guys  Way before you guys broke out  When you were playing with Ultra Spank  And Slipknot down in Houston  There you go  2000 probably  You guys are fucking ridiculous that night  I went there to see Slipknot

[01:16:30]  Awesome  Thanks guys  Alright  You guys ever think it would have gotten this big  Oh absolutely not  This is an absolute anomaly  Like when you started out you guys just got together  You had fun playing together  Thought you'd do some local gigs and have a good time right  And you know really for us it was about writing  I mean we really enjoyed just writing music  Do you remember the moment when you realized  Oh my god  Holy crap this is going to take off  What was it was it anything good  Was it hearing it on the radio 
[01:17:00]  A song on the radio  We've got  We have like a little bit of personal mythology in the band  And at a certain point  We collectively identified a moment  And specified it  And said this is the point forever  This is the now forever  Really  Oh yeah absolutely  You had a sign  There was a moment where  Yeah yeah absolutely  Where we just realized like  What we were doing  The gravity of what it was  You know  It meant something  And that people were probably going to receive it 
[01:17:30]  And we wanted to be  We wanted to be a part of it  It was about six months  Before we got a record contract  And make it our whole life  Yeah  You know  And that's when we  It was all kind of  Absolutely  It got a little bit bigger than just us  Like we were saying  In the beginning of the interview  I don't know  I don't want to say too much more  Why?  Sounds kind of interesting  Well it just sounds to me  Like devil worship  Sounds like ritual  There's a little bit of that ritual  A little satanic ritual  Sounds like it might have been a Ouija board 
[01:18:00]  How are we going to get popular?  When we got  After we got a record deal  Actually we just shook that eight thing  Yeah the eight ball  I was going to say  It wasn't an eight ball  And it said  And we flipped it over  And it said  Yes  I said yes  And I was like oh my god  I  When we got signed  I at one point said  I would be shocked  If we sold 150,000 records  Or sold 100,000 records  Like that was not going to be possible  And you guys have sold at least 200  Yeah we actually  You know what

I heard when you guys were talking about  Certain people not coming on the show  And Anthony and you guys  You're saying that these people were dead to you  And then I went on Whack Bag  And saw the pictures of the gravestones  Of certain  You know like Brewer, Dice 
[01:28:30]  Lewis Black  Carlos Mencia  And Anthony said  I was driving  With my buddies  And Anthony said  Jay fucking Moore  That's right  Jay fucking Moore  And everyone tore me a new asshole  I went back on the show  And everyone crushed me  You know what is a credit to Jay  Everyone was bashing Jay  Before he called  And got back with the show  After I called  After I called  Yeah  But you turned it around  How he stands with our show  I love it

[01:51:00]  His virginity to this girl  And he's just out of his mind?  Maybe yeah  Could you imagine him  Going  Feeling like that  Going over  Her house  And  Like  You see maybe  She's moving by the window  Or something  And you go to peek  In her room  And there's your best friend  Just railing her in the ass  He'd have to kill himself  He would have to kill himself  Right there  Mike Jersey  What's up?

[01:51:30]  Maybe a kiss  If you want to  That'd be nice  That's true  Maybe he didn't  I think he's out of his mind  Because this girl was his first  Yeah  I like to bite that dude's face  Pumpkin out  Maybe first BJ  Or first something  Going on there  You know what?  Let's see  Hold on  Steve has some input  What do you have sweetie?  I was going to say  In that last part of it  He talks about  Getting a hug from her  And a kiss  If she wants to  So there wasn't a whole lot  Of physical contact  Going on with this relationship  Oh come on now  Really?

Whatever you are  Whatever you are  Talk  Yeah that dude  Had to be a virgin man  Cause he also  Like one of those dogs  From fucking school  Could never get a girl  And he finally got something  And he's all obsessed about it 
[01:53:00]  That's true too  That could be true  He's not a bad looking guy  So she's probably  Yeah he's kind of cute  And friendly  And you know whatever  Yeah and then he  Pours his heart out  On that tape  Oof  You know what I used to do  I would never sing to a girl  But I would walk by her house  With my radio play  When a cool part of the song  Came on  Like she would look out  And associate me  With the song  Yeah man  With your Peter Gabriel  You didn't really do that right?  Oh yes I did  With live Ozzy  Are you shitting me?  I'm not  You thought it would associate  Yourself 
[01:53:30]  Costanza  Like that?  Like they did on Seinfeld?  What's that?  You put the song  In the girl's head  And she associates it  With you every time  She hears it  Oh I don't know  Oh dude  I  Look  I just  I remember a letter  An anonymous letter I wrote  But I really wanted her  To know who I was  Anonymous but  Not quite anonymous  Yeah  And then I asked her out  On the phone  And she said no  She's like no  I don't think so  She was nice though  She wasn't  20 years  That's why  You listen to this  And you can laugh  And everything  But what guy  You know 
[01:54:00]  Depending on what age  You were  Didn't have the crush  Dude I  That you just  You know  Oh you're like  You wanted that girl  So bad  I said to her  Because she was hot  I said to her  You don't want to  Go out with me  Do you?  I was rubbing the phone book  And they like confidence  And she's like  No I don't think so  And I was trying to be casual  But I fucked up  I swear to god  I went  Yeah well  That's how the ball crumbles  You said that's how  The ball crumbles  You stunk back then  Oh mush mouth 
[01:54:30]  I think fans got that call  For the next flubs  No  Bloopers, flubs  And for real  Teenage humiliations  I am Iron Man  If I walk by the house  Did you time your steps  And the part  And everything  Oh I got to time  If I walk from this sewer cap  Over here  To that  The door  It should kick in  Wow  I should have had a nozzle  Hanging off me 
[01:55:00]  You had it bad then  I was  That's pretty bad  The letter I wrote  I did something like  I'm like  If you want to know who I am  Wear like such and such a shirt  It was like serial killers  In a weird way  On Tuesday  Like a pink shirt on Tuesday  And she did  Or something I told her  To signal  And of course she did  I just liked the fact  That we had a little communication  Oh my god  I had no balls  Or anything  Growing up  It was  I was the worst  With girls  When I was really young 
[01:55:30]  Like I'm talking  Fifth grade  Sixth grade  We had this thing  Where we had to  Make these  No balls  You were getting laid at 13  That's when I was older  I'm talking  Fat chicks on a horse  I'm talking fifth grade  And stuff like that  Fourth grade  Thirteen  I was still  Four to five years away  From getting laid  We had to make these  Dineramas  You ever make these  In shoe boxes  You put them in a shoe box  And you make these little scenes  Like Civil War  And you know  Things like that  The pilgrims  Yeah  It was a popular one  You put a mirror in there 
[01:56:00]  For Thanksgiving  For the lake  And then you put the little trees  That you make  And stuff  So we made those  And other classes  Were invited to come in  And you sat  Behind your diorama  And they would look at it  You know  So I had such a crush  On this girl  And she was walking through  And I saw her online  And everything  And I was going to try  And I was imagining  What I was going to say to her  And how it was going to go  The whole time  She was walking  Toward me  So she comes up  She's right next to me  Ready to look at my diorama 
[01:56:30]  And she finally steps in front of me  And after all this plotting  And scheming in my head  I just looked at her  She looked at me  Kind of smiled  I said nothing  And she walked away  And all that  What played out in my head  Was just nothing  And I kicked myself in the ass  For years  Just a little faggot  With a diorama  That was it  I was nothing  I should have  I should have just cut a big hole  In the back  And stuck my cock through it  Grab the tall Nordic character 
[01:57:00]  Here it is  This is a diorama  Of Loch Ness  That's right  Go lick the surgeon's photograph  Cockies  Dude you know what  I wrote this  In the notes  And I'm like  Almost  Can't say it  No what is it  I was such a notorious  Aussie fan  It is long  What did you say  The Bam Jimmy  I want to  I want to stand  Back to back  And kiss you 
[01:57:30]  Belly to belly  I think I wrote  Dear Michelle  How do you spell that  Yeah I wonder what his diorama  Was like  There's a little shoebox  With a mirror in it  Well apparently  It was snowing in this town  I wrote something about  I forget what it was  But I wrote  I think Speak of the Devil  Was out  Like Aussie's album  Yeah  But I think I wrote it  As a hint  Like in Spanish 
[01:58:00]  Or something like that  Like the name of the sea  Oh no  In your anonymous letter  So she would know it was you  Because everyone knew  You were an Aussie fan  But you did it in Spanish  Or something  So she would have to do  A parlor  Diablo  Oh my god  I should have gotten  A restraining order  I was awful  Oh is that horrid  I used to follow a girl home  Every day  Every day  Staying about 100 to 200 yards  Behind her  And then speeding up  And getting closer and closer  And then backing off 
[01:58:30]  Because I didn't have the balls  To actually confront her  Day after day  I found out that she would walk home  And it was a good mile  This was in high school actually  How long did that go on?  Off and on for  Present  Off and on for  I would say over a month  Really?  Over a month  Never said a word to her  Never said a word  Yeah  Bunch of faggots  Never said a word  And I really  At the time  I really liked this girl 
[01:59:00]  But I just couldn't  You know  Get the balls  To actually  You know  Walk up to her  And even say something  Like oh you're walking  You know  Oh what a coincidence  Something  I think at the end of it  She knew I was following her  You know what the thing was  It wasn't so much that  You're afraid to ask  Or afraid of rejection  Because of  You had it worked up  You had it so worked up  In your mind  I would rather have this hope  That it might happen someday  Than get rejected  And know that the fantasy  Is just wiped out  Right  So as long as I don't ask 
[01:59:30]  And she doesn't say no  There's always a chance  That down the line  Something's going to happen  That will bring us together  And will hold hands  I couldn't face  Being  At the assembly  You're so right  Because at the time  I couldn't face  Being rejected by her  Right  So it was like  You know  Walking up  I would get closer  And then my heart  Would just be  I would have an anxiety attack  I think  And then I would back off  Like no no  Today's not today  Nice long piece of duct tape 
[02:00:00]  Out the shovel  Waiting to clunk her over the head  Do you understand  I'm 37  And I'm still doing the same thing  I can't ask  Because I'm afraid  They're going to see  And that ruins it  Yeah  I want the fantasy  I mean this goes way back  But I believe  I stopped doing it  Because I think she was on to me  And would start walking  A lot faster  And I'm like  You know what  She's now on to this  I gotta stop this  It's him  I gotta stop this  Zoe  Zoe  The blonde angel  He's trying to scurry 
[02:00:30]  I know you  You murderer  And the old guy  From Tiny Make the Donuts  Is working behind the counter  I know you  You murderer  Alright  We should take a break  I have to tinkle up  What do you say  We hang in there together  I guess we have to  Everyone pants around  Their ankles  That's right  A bunch of men  You are  I can't find a bra  That will holster  My massive hooter  I'm very proud of my big toe  Thank God  For Whip'em Out Wednesday  Whip'em Out Wednesday  It's the worst

[02:03:00]  Well there you go  Patrice is not a nice person  This is best of both worlds  Vinny's a comic and a club owner  This is beautiful  He has an inside track on all the hackness  Patrice has been on a self-destruction mode lately  With the clubs too  I love it  Just chasing people out  Two weeks ago  I love it  Two weeks ago at the comic strip  I'm on the showroom  I swear to god  A girl left the fucking club  Crying  Not just crying  She was boo-hooing  She was running out  And her boyfriend  Walking out with no balls whatsoever  You walked how many people that night?

[02:13:30]  That's what I'm saying  You're about as unknown as me  If it wasn't for Opie and Anthony  That's not true  You jackass  He did Spider-Man  He was in the movie Spider-Man  I mean I couldn't be as unknown as you  He's six foot eight and invisible  Actually I think no one knows me  Unless I did Opie and Anthony  I'm unknown  In the 80s I'd be somebody  It's amazing how  Why do you keep saying in the 80s?  Because  What did you do in the 80s?

[02:19:30]  Will you marry me?  As he bought her a second hand wedding ring  Not a good deal  He makes me sick  Did you hear his awful proposal story?  It was in a Best Western  Like near Newark airport  They flew it  Oh it's fucking  After eating out of the diner  John Steinberg was more romantic  But he was fucking chaining Little Lisa  To the thing  And punching head on the throat  Did you hear what he said to her?  He handed her the box  And said  He turned around and walked away  And said  You can say no if you want to  How fucking sad 
[02:20:00]  How fucking unbelievably sad  What a low self-esteem  You think he was the same size  Kneeling down  Asking to marry his wife  Little fingers  Putting the ring on  Oh  The awful hands  She probably jumped twice  Before she  All right  I do  Just don't touch me no more  All right  All right  Yes  He has awful  Claymation hands  They don't bend  Take doll fingers  Just leave the ring on the pillow  I'll grab it  I can't wait until Bonnie leaves them  I just can't wait 
[02:20:30]  Curled up in the shower  Washing off  Trying to hold his face  With his little Davy and Goliath fingers  Back to the pipe  Back to gambling  Back to booze  Oh  I cannot wait  Till Vals is back  Put him right over  The top  Sell this house for  Sell this house for  For a hit  Sell that connected  To another house  Mansion  Hey Patrice  I think I found out  Why people don't like you  You're not nice  You're not a fucking nice guy 
[02:21:00]  Like you don't have  A nice thing going on  One of my first favorite  Tough crowd moments  Was awful Patrice  Jeff Garland was on the show  And Jeff said some joke  That just bombed  And Patrice was like  You're on a fucking improv show  And that's the funniest thing  You can say  And Jeff just broke out  He goes  What are you going to  Fucking bust my balls  Oh I hate that  Fred Flintstone head  He really bugs me  Every time I see  A smarmy giant head  Makes me want  Makes me want to try  To get candy out of it  That fat 
[02:21:30]  Hit it with a broomstick  You're going to curb  Your enthusiasm  Really  That makes me laugh  It's about as much as a lamp  I've never seen it  I've never seen the show  By mistake I think  There's nothing working  Except for HBO  Is it overrated  Whatever man  You know you can't even  Talk about certain things  In your careers  Or where people  Oh it's a curb  I never saw  Whatever  That moon head  I'd like to shove his head  Right in the toilet  Like Mickey Rourke  Did you get to the 
[02:22:00]  I can't even say it  Oh the trainable  No  Trainable  Well we can do that  We have to end the week  By getting rid of this  The trainable audio  And don't play the ones  We've heard  We've got four that  We haven't played yet  But first I mean  Patrice O'Neal is going to be  Playing Vinny's club  This weekend  Stress factor  What's the number again there  Jimmy  And I like the way  Vinny did this  Because what happens  Is you incorporate  Part of the mood  Into the phone number  Which is  Which I thought  Was just a super idea  It's 732-545 
[02:22:30]  Ha ha  That's like  That's like a hospital  Going  Call us at  1-743-Ow-Ow  1-800  That's  1-4-1-2  And leave off  The last tumor  For savings  545-4242 
[02:23:00]  But that comes in  A ha ha  Ha ha  That is  Absolutely  What a coincidence  Yeah  I paid extra for that  Yeah and he fought hard  For that  We said  Well we got  Giggle giggle  Do you want that one  No  No  It's got to be  Ha ha  Ha ha  Oh you're fucking stupid  I can win too many numbers  And when Keith Robinson works  You have to change  To 545  ZZ  ZZ  Oh man 
[02:23:30]  That's another black guy  I use  Two and a half  Two and a half  Two and a half black guys  Oh they're doing  Oh this  I love this  I'm in the stress factor  I stopped by this  And I'm pissing  And I look on the wall  And they have advertisers  For shows coming up  And Vinny and Keith Robinson  Are doing a father's day show  What's it called  Father's day in black and white  Father's day in black and white  Yeah  Like one black guy  One white guy  You know both dads  Probably different points of view  Ha ha ha  And fucking Keith's credits  Because this fucking  Finished  Hammer it you fucking moron  Hammer it  Next Thursday  Keith 
[02:24:00]  I have a fucking  150 on the book  For Thursday  That's a great show  Thank you  But Keith's credits  On that fucking wall  I wanted to throw that paper  Into the urinal  He said he was on  Star Search a couple of years ago  A couple of years ago  Yes  Like Keith is this up and comer  Keith is 46 years old  It's the new one on PAX  That's what he's talking about  We still have his headshot  That says Pudge him on it  Fucking Keith's first sets  Now are on the game show network 
[02:24:30]  He is fucking  An old finished man  He really is an old man now  Aw  That credit list is awful  You look at all these  Impressive credits  And then you realize  Oh those are the people  He's open for  I told you  Every time he's on stage  After he finishes the joke  He reintroduces himself  He's a big emcee  You  That's brutal  That's brutal  Anthony are right over there 
[02:25:00]  Oh yeah  Look at his geek just  Wiggling his tongue around him  Swole and go  It's like stroke face  And the worst part is  I know it's going to wear off  And the pain will come back  How long did he say it would stay  Two hours  At least until you get to the other place  You go to the other dentist  Yeah but that wears off too  I got it  Yeah but when there's no nerve man  If they get the nerve out  You can't feel anything  It's not going to exist  The pain is going to be gone  I think the penicillin's got to 
[02:25:30]  Penicillin  You get a pain medication though  From the other place  They'll prescribe something  You'll be fine man  You'll be fine  Tell him to take that nerve out  And if they get it out  And then you'll be like  Out  Let's go to Mark  Mark what's up buddy  Not much  I'm wondering if Jimmy Norton  When you call a hook  Who could you got 1-800-HO-HO  I wouldn't mind  I wouldn't have minded so much  If you didn't call her a hoker  You fucking idiot  A hoker  A hoker  A hoker  Are you a hoker  I just thought  I was doing great  Oh that poor guy 
[02:26:00]  Was waiting for hours  Oh he was  I'm going to crack them all up  They're going to love this  I smell dead people  I farted  The OPN Anthony Show  Hey this is Susie Essman  You're listening to  The worst of Opie and Anthony  How much worse can it get  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony  I haven't heard it said yet  New Orleans is like a bull  Enough with the bull 
[02:26:30]  Wasn't there some kind of a levy  Like some guy drove a Chevy to it  And it was dry  Yeah  Yeah  Some good old boys down there  Drinking something  My hat blew off  And then he came in my eye  Fucking dumb song  Dude it means Elvis  Yeah does it  We should do wacky radio today  And just play songs  With the word levy  With the word levy in it  Did he fuck that up  It means Elvis  Elvis  Whatever it means  I don't even  That shows you what I know  And the Martian band 
[02:27:00]  Did they stop marching  Eight minute song  We get it  When that song comes on  I cannot change it quickly enough  It's like long  Get it  Yeah  A long  They took the last train from  Really  And then like ten minutes later  You think you're safe  You go back  Bye bye  Mrs. Shut up  I understand Steve is panicking  Because he heard down in New Orleans  That the honey jars  Had been blown off the shelves  The fire ants have stolen his shirts 
[02:27:30]  I can still remember  How that music used to make me smile  And I'll tell you all about it in real time right now  I knew if I had my chance  That I could make those people dance  And maybe they'd be happy  I'd see that gift in Ben's pants  The song's longer than the Edmund Fitzgerald 
[02:28:00]  Every paper I'd deliver  Bad news on the doorstep  I couldn't take one more step  Okay, so the paper got delivered  And it was bad news  I can't remember  If I cried  When I read about his widowed bride  Who's widowed bride?  Something touched me deep inside  The day  The music  Died 
[02:28:30]  And here we go  Who's widowed bride?  Buddy Holly  Frankenstein  Oh  Bye bye  Miss America  Who's she?  I don't know  They went to the levee  But the levee was  Why?  It was a dry  Good old boys  Because they cried so much  There were no more tears left  I think  Why was the good old boys drinking?  Why are they drinking and saying that  It's because the levee's dry  Exactly  No threat  Why would they take a Chevy to it? 
[02:29:00]  Why would they take a Chevy to it?  This guy's like a real cock  Did you ride in your love  And that you have taken time  Take your Chevy into a ditch  With drunk driving fucking wrath  How do you believe in rock and rolling music  Save your mortal soul and love  Right  We get it  It was a big day  Yeah  We know it's stuck  We know it's stuck  We're taking a ditching  Why'd you write a song called Fly Commercial 
[02:29:30]  You chintzy jizzbags?  The presumptuous ass that someone would want to sit through a song this long  What?  Rock and Buck  Six minutes left  And you'll hear every minute here on the Opie and Anthony show  That's right  Better than playing commercials  Goodbye, goodbye, Mr. American Pie  I started singing  Bye  Everybody  Why, stop it 
[02:30:00]  Okay, terrific  Stop it  And Ben came in and said  No, I'm talking boss  I did something  What?  Kevin and Jerry's  Go ahead  What's up, man?  I got a funny little ISO, guys  Yeah  It is actually  J.F.K.  Widowed Pride  Yeah  I actually  That's the first thing I thought of  Was when he was thinking about  Jackie Onassis  Or Jackie Kennedy  When the Jester sang 
[02:30:30]  When the King and Queen  My first song was Jackie Kennedy  Who's the Jester?  I don't know  Who's the King and Queen?  I don't know  James Dean  I know there's a whole website  That explains every  That's probably a bunch of  A line of the goddamn song  And if one more person  Sends me the hidden meanings  To The Shining  It's fucking wrong  Of course it is  Nonsense  Stop looking for shit  Kubrick was a genius  But he didn't go that deep  Are we done with this song?  Does it get any?  No, I want to hear more open  What does that mean? 
[02:31:00]  I think it's about  The Kennedy assassination  But I want to hear more of that song  What happened to it?  Let's say hi to  Kenny in South Carolina  Kenny  Hey, what's going on guys?  Kenny's the comedian around here  What's up Kenny?  Ha ha ha  I was going to tell you  You're missing the obvious  Levy song 
[02:31:30]  Are you?  When the Levy Breaks  By Led Zeppelin  Well I was thinking  We could just play  Levy songs all day  For dollars  Or clips of Bob Levy  He's funny  Yeah  When the Levy Breaks  I die  This'll be the day  That I die  Helped a skelter  In a summer swell  Where the birds  Flew off  Where the fallout  Oh, that's the Manson thing, right? 
[02:32:00]  Yeah  I see  Maybe the music died  When JFK was shot  Because everything changed  And maybe he's going through  Other things that happened  Because it was a marching band  That kind of wouldn't yield  He's got a fill eight minutes  Is he talking about the 60s?  I'm thinking he did  Yeah  But why wouldn't the marching band stop?  It's all about the music of the time  I don't know  Yeah  That's what it is  And how rock and roll changed  After Buddy Holly's plane crashed  Yeah  It got better  Of course it did 
[02:32:30]  I like Buddy Holly  You know  But come on  The big bopper  Who gave a shit about it?  Bob  Hello baby  Yeah  Oh, Chantilly Lays  Shut up  We're too low, baby  Shouldn't fly in the snow, baby  Oh, Chantilly Lays  Fuselage in my face  Shut your big bopping face, stupid  Have a seat cushion in the mouth  Hello baby 
[02:33:00]  Baby  Yeah, this is the big bopper speaking  Oh, you're not clear for landing  Could you shut that guy up  And listen to the air traffic controller  Chantilly Lays  And a booty face  And a ponytail  We're plummeting down  Mike in Oklahoma 
[02:33:30]  Hello  Hey Mike  Yes, why is this funny  That people are going to die in New Orleans?  We're not  We're making fun of the  First of all  God damn  How are we supposed to do a show  When the god damn death dedication  People dying  We're making fun of the news coverage  And the panic of the news coverage  And the reality is  We don't know them  Yeah  It doesn't matter if you don't know  Dude, how do you not get  Dude, how do you  Mike, people die every single day  Yes 
[02:34:00]  Yes, people die every single day  And I bet a lot of people you hang out with  Die more often than that  Judging by your voice  Go visit a friend with a poodle recently, have you?  Ah, yes  That's hilarious  Yes, it is  Oklahoma, huh?  How's it going in Oklahoma today?  It was fine until you start making fun  We're making fun of what?  What did we say specifically?  Hold on, hold on  What did we say specifically about either people dying or the hurricane that offended you and thought we were making fun of people dying? 
[02:34:30]  I don't know, maybe like the whole last 45 minutes of your show?  What?  No, specifically  What was the thing we said?  What was the thing?  You're playing When the Levee Breaks and it's...  No, we played Bye Bye Miss American Pie and we talked about how much the song stinks  And the news coverage and how they try to panic you and MSNBC was the only one doing it accurately and actually reporting what was going on  No, they're not panicking anybody  Yes, they are  I think these news networks are...  They've hyped this like a movie 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, they're doing a disservice to the rest of the country, you know, putting the fear in all of this  Absolutely, and I don't mean...  I'm not like...  And that's what we're pointing out  Yes  They basically said last night on TV that New Orleans would be no more  It wouldn't exist after today  So, like, I understand that you and your faggot voice, you kind of, you hear this...  Oh, me and my...  Excuse me?  You kind of have a little bit of a faggot voice  And I understand that you hear this and you shoot for the pink team, don't you?  Oh, excuse me, Mr. Monster Rain  Exactly  Me and my faggot voice, okay  Boy, you listen to this show a lot, don't you?  Wow 
[02:35:30]  Good boy  Uh-huh, yeah  You know, if you pick the one thing that really turned him on  I've never had dick in my mouth, how about you, Norton?  Well, you probably took it right in your keister, didn't you, little fella?  Why waste time in the mouth when you can be in there pushing stool?  The mouth is a waste of time, you silly goose  Shove it in my ass so I can go, ooh, ah  You are laughing at people dying  No, I'm laughing at your faggoty voice  You do have a faggot voice, and I don't mean any disrespect by that  But you have to admit, people have questioned your sexuality by your voice  Yeah  How many times has that happened? 
[02:36:00]  Many times  Yeah  So why would I say that you get to face with a man?  But I'm a faggot  I'm a faggot, and I'm proud  And you've never had a dick in your mouth? You just lied?  No, I've never had dick in my mouth  What kind of faggot doesn't have a dick in his mouth?  A good faggot  See?  No, it's a bad faggot  You're not a good faggot  A good faggot has a dick in his mouth  Exactly  Matter of fact, a good faggot has one in each hand and one on the chin  A good faggot puts his dick in a mouth  No  No  No, sir 
[02:36:30]  You never reciprocated once in your life?  Selfish  Yeah, exactly  It's all about you  It is  And I like it like that  Alright  Well, this call turned hot quickly  Jesus  No  You know what?  Now it's about faggot  Oh, you like that, don't you faggot?  Do you wanna kiss me on the mouth?  Yeah  I'm gonna stick my hard cock in your mouth  You wanna feel it?  Hello  Fuckface  Just a fuckface  Stop calling me that 
[02:37:00]  Alright, thanks  Do you wanna kiss me?  Mike, yeah  I'm gonna kiss you on the mouth  Mike was getting us some juicy stuff there, Ope  He's still there, Mike  Hello?  Go ahead  Go ahead  I'm still here  And you still haven't properly defended yourself about laughing about people dying  Yes, we did  We did, and the bottom line is  There's gonna be crocodiles and alligators roaming around the streets, biting people  Alright, we get you now  Alright, thank you, Mike  Is the song still going on, you think?  This is marching band 
[02:37:30]  Oh, the marching band refused to yield  Hey, how come you guys are making fun of people who sang Shantilly Lake?  Shut up  The marching band was that important?  You know, he missed the whole point about that  You know, we were talking about MSNBC doing a good job in their coverage  Did you hear what they were saying?  We hear that there are some problems with the Superdome  Everybody's okay  Nothing to panic about  No big deal  MSNBC was doing it right  Fox and CNN are like  The whole world's coming down  Fire ants and corpses and everything's going to crap  Fox 
[02:38:00]  Did you notice, by the way, in the Big Bobber song  Chantilly Lace  Bring me  Ramone  Bring me some Chantilly Lace  Oh, Ramone  You know what I like  You guys want some other news other than the hurricane?  Alright  But February made me shiver 
[02:38:30]  Buddy Holly died on February 3, 1959 in a plane crash in Iowa during a snowstorm  The news came to most of the world on the morning of February 3, which is why it's known as the day the music died  I never have come across a February 3, and I thought that  With every paper I'd deliver, Don McClain's only job besides being a full-time songwriter was being a overboy  Caddy at the Crescent Club?  No?  Yeah  Air traffic control?  What'd the little lad do?  Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry 
[02:39:00]  Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye singing  That'll...  This'll be the day that I die  This'll...  Be the day that I die  Well, one of Holly's hits was  That'll be the day  Oh, okay  The chorus contains the line  That'll be the day that I die  When you say goodbye  That'll be the day  By the way, dude, you...  Oh, you missed this right here  Oh  Um...  You have to...  There's a line up here  Because...  Where the hell is it?  It's... 
[02:39:30]  It's a line here about...  See this I didn't see  Bad news on the doorstep  I couldn't take one more step  I can't remember if I cried  And there was an explanation  Yeah  When I read about his widowed bride  See Holly's recent bride  Maria Elena  Oh, this is terrible  Was pregnant when the crash took place  And she miscarried  Well, I know you're in love with him  Because I saw you dancing in the gym  Slow dancing could just be dancing 
[02:40:00]  Or it could be vertical making out  It wasn't hard to watch a couple slow dancing  And figure out whether they had some sort of relationship  If you knew anything about slow dancing  God  You guys want to know any more?  No  This is great  Where are you?  New Orleans  But that's not how it used to be  When the Jester sang for the king and queen  We asked about that one  Well, the Jester is Bob  The Jester is Bob Dylan 
[02:40:30]  What?  As will become clear later  There are several interpretations of king and queen  Some think that Elvis Presley is the king  Oh  Which seems pretty obvious  The queen is said to be either Connie Francis or Little Richard  If he's singing about Connie Francis  I'll fucking  I'll put a bullet in his face  If he's actually put Connie Francis  Connie Francis  An alternate interpretation is that  This refers to the Kennedys  The king and queen of Camelot  Who were present at a Washington D.C. civil rights rally  Featuring Martin Luther King  Camelot  He almost tripped up his name there 
[02:41:00]  I know  Oh and while the king was looking down  The Jester stole his thorny crown  This could be a reference to Elvis' decline and Dylan's ascendance  The thorny crown might be a reference to the price of fame  Dylan has said that he wanted to be as famous as Elvis  One of his early idols  How about this  Somebody says to Don McLean  Hey faggot what's that song about?  Oh it's a whole thing  Pumps failing  Pumps failing 
[02:41:30]  In New Orleans  Pumps are failing  Just came up on Fox News  Structural damage throughout New Orleans  Oh my god there's another one  Due to the high winds  Comb sales are up 2,000%  Let's see the song  Oh god stop  No angel born in hell  You could break that Satan's spell 
[02:42:00]  Alright wait I gotta look at that one  What was that one again?  Breaking Satan's spell  Satan's spell  Something about Satan's spell  Satan's spell  He's talking about Aussie  Pull out shelters  Yield  Oh well that's too long of an explanation  Friends  Okay and as I watched him on the stage  My hands were clenched in fists of rage  Which voice?  No  Oh  Tiny hands  Angel born in hell could break that Satan's spell 
[02:42:30]  While playing a concert at the Altamont Speedway in 1968  The Stones appointed members of the Hells Angels to work security  Stop  On the advice of the Grateful Dead  In the darkness near the front of the stage  A young man named Meredith Hunter was beaten and stabbed to death by the angels  The angels  Oh  Public outcry that the song Sympathy for the Devil had somehow inside the violence caused the Stones to drop the song from their show for the next six years 
[02:43:00]  This incident is chronicled in the documentary film Gimme Shelter  It goes on and on  Alright  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony  Time just stinks  No one beats time  Doesn't matter who you are and what you do  Time blows and wins in the end  Which workbook?

And punch her in the mouth?  Um  It was abusive  But um  It was kind of a psychological thing  You know she felt  That she made herself big  That she'd be undesirable to him  And he'd leave her  Oh that's the strategy

To kick him at his fat wife right down the steps  Good karate kick to the spine  Take that with some hot soup in your hand  Opie  Anthony  Dance Party Weekend  Wait wait wait wait 
[03:02:30]  Nah nah nah nah  Nah nah nah  The Opie and Anthony Show  Comedy gone too far  The Worst of Opie and Anthony  Let's say hi to Charles Ross  One Man Star Wars Show  How's it going?  Hi mister  Hey  One man show  Yeah based on Star Wars  Based on Star Wars  It is Star Wars essentially  It's Star Wars  That's the definitive Star Wars  Star Wars.  I wouldn't say definitive.  I would say sort of the bastardization of it.  Bastardization.  Where do you do this? 
[03:03:00]  Well, here I'm doing it in New York at the Lamb's Theater, which is 130 West 44th.  It's kind of weird, man.  Like, this is a comedy sketch that went really, really wrong.  Isn't it like Broadway over there?  Yeah, it is.  Well, it's considered off-Broadway.  Off-Broadway.  And I'm definitely the most off thing on Broadway.  So you're playing this as an off-Broadway show you're doing?  Well, I mean, I got my licensing agreements and stuff like that, so I mean, I don't feel  too bad about it.  Can you do it for us?  The whole thing?  Or just a piece of it.  How long is it?  That's an hour.  Well, we've got about an hour left on the show.  An hour, Sean. 
[03:03:30]  Can you cut the 54th?  I could do it, but I'd sweat all over the place and be positively discussed.  What exactly is the theme of the show?  Well, okay, imagine you just take, you know, Star Wars and take all the tech out of it.  So it's just me doing, like, all the voices, all the, like, the music and stuff.  It's kind of a dumb idea, and it kind of is dumb for the first five minutes, but I think  people kind of dig it because people know Star Wars pretty well.  Do you get a lot of geeks in there?  Yeah, for sure.  There's a high geek sort of concentration.  Do you use props?  No.  No.  It's just you and your voice. 
[03:04:00]  Yeah, it's a really stupid idea.  I mean, I thought it was a dumb idea.  I will not argue with you.  Way to get people to buy tickets.  Do you have music that plays?  No, no, it's just me.  It's just you.  Do you use a microphone or do you yell?  Yeah, I do use a microphone.  I mean, you and a mic.  Yeah, well, I've played it for, like, 3,500 people.  Just a...  No, no, no, underneath.  Underneath, I wear a kill.  Yeah.  You wear just regular clothes or is it...  No, no.  It's like a person that would work on an airplane, like a flight suit type thing. 
[03:04:30]  Oh.  Just something really boring.  But it's black.  It's supposed to be really neutral.  And, yeah, once again, I never thought this idea would work, but that was about three years  ago and I've been doing it ever since.  And who came up to you and said, this can be off-Broadway?  Nobody.  Nobody.  It was actually...  I met this guy when I was touring it on this thing, the Fringe Tour, which, I mean, there's  American cities that do the Fringe and there's Canadian cities.  I'm from Canada.  And now it makes perfect sense.  Now it makes perfect sense.  Now I was thinking, like, wait, wait, this is a little odd.  Canadian.  There was something in the water. 
[03:05:00]  Right.  So do you feel like...  You've seen the new ones, right?  Yeah.  I mean, I've seen some of the old ones.  My friend watched the new ones.  Yeah.  And he thinks that a lot of the technology and stuff has kind of surpassed a lot of what  Lucas originally kind of intended to be, you know, like his whole thing.  Like the space sort of cowboy western thing?  Well, um...  Well, I don't know, man.  I think the new things are made for new kids. 
[03:05:30]  Like, you know, they're just made to...  I mean, they sell toys.  They get the kids to come out.  You know, they're sort of the helium-infused weird little character.  I don't know.  They're not up my alley, but when I was a kid and watched the old Star Wars films...  So you were a big fan.  Oh, well, when I was a kid.  Yeah, absolutely.  What was your favorite part of the original?  The original?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  There was too many parts.  Actually, I really liked the evil guy, the emperor.  I mean, I thought he was sort of like...  Oh, really?  Well, he's like the perfect...  Not many people pick that.  Really?  That guy.  I thought he was just like the perfect sarcastic bastard.  And he was perfect. 
[03:06:00]  Usually Vader or, you know...  Yeah.  I don't know.  He was cool.  But, you know, it's kind of hard to believe that, you know, a guy with a voice that cool  could have given or been sort of the seed of Luke.  You know, the little whiny...  Yeah, I know.  He's whined through the entire movie.  But if you watch the old films or the new films now, you can see how much the Canadian  guy who plays Anakin Skywalker...  Yeah, he's a whiny bastard, too.  Now, obviously, you were a big fan because you must have done the impressions.  Yeah.  Do you do the good impressions of this?  I wouldn't say there are good impressions, but some of them are good impressions. 
[03:06:30]  Some of them are good.  Some of them aren't so good, like Yoda sucks, but whereas Admiral Ackbar, do you know who  I'm talking about?  Yeah, the fish-eyed guy.  Yeah, that's him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, I do a pretty good version of that, which is kind of cool because today I got an  audition for a Star Wars video game.  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  Only through being in New York could you possibly get an audition to do a Star Wars video game  where they actually need an Admiral Ackbar.  And what about some of the sound effects?  Obviously, the lightsaber would be a big one.  I mean, it sounds really dumb.  Absolutely. 
[03:07:00]  No, it sounds kind of cool.  But the point is that you get into the context of the show, right?  And like, how is it going to work?  Is it going to work or not going to work?  Yeah.  And I mean, I can give you guys like a two-minute bit from the show if you want.  Absolutely.  I'd love to hear it.  Okay.  This here is the trash compactor scene from the first film.  And just bear with me.  Should I watch or kind of shut my eyes and imagine?  Oh, let's all imagine.  Let's all imagine.  Okay, audience.  You want to stand up?  Even if you're driving, shut your eyes.  No.  Well, let's here.  I'll stand up.  Can I move the microphone?  Yeah, you should stand up.  And of course, we want the listeners to comment.  Serious comments about... 
[03:07:30]  Serious.  Yes.  We got a lot of clowns that want to call in, but we want serious comments only.  All right.  Charles Ross, the one-man Star Wars show.  Here's the scene.  Get behind me.  Get behind me.  This is some rescue.  You got in here.  Didn't you have a plan for getting out?  Well, he's the brain, sweetheart.  What the hell are you doing?  Something has to save us kids.  In the garbage soup, Flyboy.  Can't there be big, will you?  I don't care what you smell.  Get in there.  Get in there.  Wonderful girl.  I'm going to kill her and begin to like her. 
[03:08:00]  Get in there.  Ah, the garbage chute.  What a wonderful idea.  What an incredible smell you discovered.  Well, it could be worse.  It's worse.  There's something alive in here.  Something just swam past my leg.  Look, did you see that?  Kid, Luke.  Kid, Luke. 
[03:08:30]  Blessed will you have my guns jammed.  Where?  Oh, anywhere.  No.  Kid, Luke.  Kid, Luke.  Luke.  Grab him.  What happened?  I don't know.  Just let go of me and disappeared.  The walls are closing in.  Don't you stand there? 
[03:09:00]  Try to brace him or something.  Wait a minute.  3PO?  Come here, 3PO.  3PO.  3PO.  Oh, where could he be?  3PO.  3PO.  Are you there, sir?  3PO.  We've had some problems.  Will you shut them, Mr. Me?  Shut down all the garbage smashes on the detention level.  Do you copy?  Shut down all the garbage smashes on the detention level.  No, shut them all down.  Hurry.  Hey, you did it, 3PO.  Oh, look.  Listen to them, R2.  They're dying.  Oh, curse my metal body.  I wasn't fast enough. 
[03:09:30]  It's all my fault.  My fault.  We're all right.  You did great.  Where are we?  3, 2, 6, 3, 8, 2, 7.  And that's how it goes.  Wow.  But for an hour.  Wow.  Why did you chuck all the chips across the table?  The poker chips.  That's the blessing of the poker chips.  The blessing.  The blessing of the poker chips.  The only thing I see is I did not hear Chewbacca.  Oh, well, he'd be like,  I heard that.  Oh, I didn't even catch it.  Okay.  All right. 
[03:10:00]  Now, you do that for an hour straight.  Yeah.  Yeah.  At that speed.  Faster.  There's no...  No break.  No pauses like they would normally pause between these lines.  You just rattle it out.  Well, I mean, there's a little bit of break.  Yeah.  I don't know.  How much of the...  You do the entire movie.  Well, I mean, it's like the...  It's the Reader's Digest version.  It's like been really super condensed now.  Yeah.  And I do Lord of the Rings as well, which is just dumb.  But anyway, it works.  Wow.  Yeah, you...  Okay, but... 
[03:10:30]  Okay, there's this big, big, giant dork convention,  a Star Wars convention called Celebration 3,  which happened in Indianapolis.  And, I mean, you get 3,500 people watching this show at a time.  Yeah.  Which is really, really strange.  I don't know, man.  I don't doubt it.  Wow.  Yeah.  I mean, like movie screens on the other side of the audience  or on the other side of the stage and then out over the audience.  And you'd never think that there could be that many people  that know Star Wars that well.  And what's the reaction as you're doing it?  Are they laughing?  Are they...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  For sure.  For sure.  And they're watching intently? 
[03:11:00]  Well, for some people, it's just like...  It's like watching a kid in the basement or something like that.  Yeah.  For other people, it's about being able to sort of celebrate  their own personal infatuation with Star Wars, you know?  Yeah.  So, you either find people that really are laughing at it  and other people that are laughing sort of with you.  Yeah.  It's really strange to have.  Wow.  Well, you've taken something and ran with it.  Yeah.  Congratulations.  Cheers.  Thank you.  And best of luck to you with your one-man show.  We got some phone calls coming in. 
[03:11:30]  We have Jimmy Robinson on the phone.  Jimmy!  Hey, this is Jimmy from New Jersey.  Hey, Jimmy.  What's up, man?  Hey, do you do this scene?  I like this scene in Star Wars when he had to fight.  And then there's just the empty robe with no one in it?  Yeah.  Do you do that one?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Do you do the Robert Reed version?  The Robert Reed version.  Do you even die?  Yeah, yeah.  You stink.  Hey, serious calls only, you asshole. 
[03:12:00]  You stink.  This is what happens now.  We get a guest on the show.  This is textbook.  Oh, wow.  Get a guest on the show, and people call up, and no matter how much we tell them we just  want serious calls, the assholes get through.  You stink.  Do you get a lot of criticism?  You are at stinks.  Do you get a lot of criticism?  There's a lot of criticism, and that's really high-brow criticism, man.  Yeah.  That's amazing.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm crushed.  The thing is, I think based upon that kind of a phone call, I'm pretty much resolved not  to do the show anymore.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I'm sure that guy was... 
[03:12:30]  That was the last time, guys, you're ever going to hear it.  Loser sitting in his apartment, probably getting prostitutes at night to piss on him.  Well, let's say hi to Dr. Frank Davis.  Dr. Frank Davis.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  All right.  I'm a doctor at Bellevue, a psychiatrist.  Listen, just keep him distracted.  We're sending a few guys there to get him.  You stink, you nut job.  Thank you.  Let's say hi to...  Let's say hi to...  Let's go to Ben in Boston.  Ben?  You like that, huh, Ben?  Ben.  Yeah.  Can you see where the Falcon goes and pick up Tom Brady? 
[03:13:00]  We all do...  Seems to be doing his own one-man show all day long.  I think this guy enjoyed it.  Ben from Boston.  Holy man, I've got to get there to Boston.  Yeah.  Any ideas of maybe taking it on the road?  It's been on the road for the last three years, man.  Really?  So you're not just here in New York, you'll be going other places?  No, there's this thing called Clear Channel, which I'm sure we're all aware of. 
[03:13:30]  Yes, everybody is aware of.  And I'm going to, at least with the Lord of the Rings show, I'm going to be going to  South Africa and Singapore and...  You're shitting me.  Man, I really...  Is there good money in this?  I haven't had another job for the last four years, man.  Have you had to pay Lucas anything?  Oh, yeah.  For the rights?  I mean, you get a proper licensing agreement.  Yeah.  If you don't do that, you can, you know...  Yeah, that'll cost you.  So, I mean, it's weird.  I really never intended for the show to go as it has, and I'm really glad that it has. 
[03:14:00]  What, was it just kind of a hobby?  No, it was a...  I mean, I was working as an actor, and one day, like, literally, I wrote this comedy  sketch, and when I say it went really wrong, it went really, really right or really, really  wrong, because I didn't think people would be able to sort of keep up with it.  Right.  And people have been able to keep up with it.  So, this has kind of almost left my own hands.  I find myself here, not intending to come here to New York to bring this here.  But, you know, it's kind of go bigger or go back home.  And, I mean, I don't have a problem doing it. 
[03:14:30]  You're going to franchise it out?  No, I don't think so.  Get some other actors to do it, and you just sit home and pocket some cash?  That would be nice, but I turn into Jabba the Hutt and lose my leg.  That's it.  Why don't we go to Steve in Yellowstone?  Steve in Yellowstone.  Steve?  Uh, hi, I just wanted to know if you had any type of a copyright problem when you were  dealing with George Lucas like I've had sometimes on my website.  Uh, yeah, I mean, it is a copyright problem because it is, uh, you know, a matter of...  Ramon! 
[03:15:00]  Bring me someone with talent.  What the fuck are you talking about, you fucking retard?  Yeah!  Yeah.  Have fun in Yellowstone, buddy.  Maybe you can sit on, like, you know, the Old Faithful and have it go up your ass, you  stupid piece of shit.  Wow, man.  I'm absolutely, you know, crushed down to my very foundations, man.  I just don't...  This is amazing.  All right, thank you, Steve in Yellowstone.  Hey, man.  Good luck.  A guy is successful taking something and using his talent to get out on stage and actually 
[03:15:30]  do...  Did you, uh, uh, you've been an actor, you said, uh...  Yeah, yeah, I mean, uh...  So now you're finally doing something that's working, you're making my...  And people just can't seem to, uh, deal with that.  Steve?  Well, at least not the people that are calling in here.  God, man.  Yeah, I think it's pretty impressive.  Steve or something.  You want to do another scene, or...?  Ah, no, no.  That's fine, actually.  I mean, not many of the scenes from the show really work purely on radio, like, because  a lot of it doesn't really all stick together.  But, I mean, like, you get something like, you know... 
[03:16:00]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, she became a garbawarpa kawawuki.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Ah!  Which is obviously, you know...  Jabba.  No, it's Princess Leia.  But, uh, you know...  Of course.  Yeah.  I mean, there's scenes that people definitely recognize, and there's characters, like,  you know, people don't recognize, right?  Yes.  I'm like, hmmm...  Of course.  Yeah.  But, um...  Yeah.  It's weird, man.  Like, you kind of have to see it on stage in order to really get the full idea of it.  Well, that's why it's a stage show, and you don't have a CD out. 
[03:16:30]  Do you have a CD out?  No.  It's not a CD or a DVD.  See?  And that's another thing, man.  Like, if, uh...  It's a weird thing with, you know, copyright material, you know...  You can only do this in one medium, live, like that.  If you wanted to put a CD out, you'd have to pay Lucas more money.  Ah, yeah.  I don't think I could ever get the rights to do it.  No?  No, not really.  And that's okay.  I mean, it's something I wouldn't want to franchise out, because as long as I can do it, I'll continue  doing it.  Right.  And I hopefully will not be a 65-year-old man, you know, like,  the one-man Star Wars trilogy, you know, like, nattering out on stage. 
[03:17:00]  That'd be a little rough.  Listen to the screams of a person in Yellowstone National Park.  Sounds like you need some more...  Ah, that guy with the lungs.  That guy was just an ass.  Oh, well.  So what are the details?  The show's here in New York, right?  It is indeed, yeah.  It plays every night at 8 o'clock, except for Wednesdays.  Right now we have matinees at 3 o'clock.  And it's going to be changing the schedule up a bit.  We'll still have the shows at 8 o'clock every night, but we'll have a 3 o'clock matinee on Saturday  and Sunday.  And you can get tickets by calling telecharge.  Jimmy, you missed it.  What happened? 
[03:17:30]  You all right?  Yes.  I was trying to get some production stuff because they're...  Oh.  Yeah.  Always the way.  Yes.  Well, Charles, thank you very much.  Oh, thanks for having me, guys.  We're coming in.  Sorry about the goddamn phone calls.  You were in 15 minutes, why are you?  Jackasses.  That's all right.  Yeah, it's just production stuff that Ben was supposed to do and did not do.  Oh.  Can you do, um...  Thank you.  Can you do C-3PO?  C-3PO.  R-2-D-2, where are you? 
[03:18:00]  Yeah.  Can you do, um...  I pardon you.  Jesus.  I pardon you.  They could just go on and on.  How about, um...  I don't know all the characters, because I was out there yesterday.  It was like, uh...  R-2?  No, no.  Yeah, R-2.  Well, if you don't know the show, I mean, if you don't know the movies, it's...  No, no.  I saw the first one, but I don't know any of the new guys.  I do know R-2 with my slide whistle.  Yeah.  See?  You need a...  You need a prop.  I feel like a prop sometimes.  Oh, don't you sweat it. 
[03:18:30]  I won't.  I like seeing a successful guy.  Of course.  Cheers, guys.  Thanks a lot.  All right.  Thank you.  Charles Ross.  One-man Star Wars show.  And there he goes.  We should take a break, I think, huh?  Charles?  We're going to take a break.  We're going to regroup, and we'll continue with the Opie and Anthony show in a few moments.  Yeah?  Yeah?  We'll continue in a couple of moments.  What happened?  Oh, shit.  What happened?  Oh, was he fucking pissed.  Why? 
[03:19:00]  Livid.  He just walked out, by the way.  That wasn't a take it easy.  Immediately left.  And he...  Yeah, just...  Did he cut some liners?  No.  He took off before his crew here even knew that he was gone.  He was already out the door, and they were like, oh, he left already.  And they took off after him.  Someone follow him with the cell phone.  Wow.  As he pissed off.  See, what's wrong?  Yeah.  Someone who has balls, see what's...  Yeah.  Hurry up, Hawke.  See what's wrong.  I'm trying to ask him, you know, if everything went okay.  Well, that stupid caller from Yellowstone pissed him off. 
[03:19:30]  See, from Yellowstone.  Well, that's Derek.  Creative little boy.  Steve from Yellowstone.  I sometimes have problems.  Hello?  No?  I thought we had somebody.  What's the problem?  Oh, wait.  Here we go.  Eric?  Yeah?  What's up?  Hey.  Hang on one second.  Hey, before you guys go, can they talk to you one more time?  It was about the lamp theater and everything.  We're bad for his plug, because he didn't say the lamp theater and all that.  He did. 
[03:20:00]  Come on, Peter?  Can they talk to you one more time?  Just...  We don't think it went well.  We want to ask him why he left angry.  Okay.  Hold on.  Hey.  Charles, you're not mad, are you?  No, it's just...  What happened?  It's all right, man.  No, what happened?  The theater is 130 West 44.  No, but the thing was, you seemed like you left when you were mad.  Uh, yeah, I know.  I just...  You know, it's just kind of shitty, the phone calls coming in, and I don't know. 
[03:20:30]  I kind of feel like it's an uphill battle, man.  I was puking all yesterday, and I've been puking this morning.  I'm really kind of sick, so it's not your fault.  It's me.  Charles.  The audience, too.  Charles, there's only three phone calls.  I know.  I know, man.  Out of the three we talked.  That's not that bad.  It's not your guys' fault, man.  I'm just being a big baby, so...  Yeah.  All right.  Sorry.  Yeah, but why are you being a baby?  All right.  You're very talented, obviously, and the show's doing very well.  No, it's doing well, man.  What kind of...  Are you not sick like a flu or something, are you?  Yeah, I've had the flu for like the last couple days. 
[03:21:00]  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Hope you didn't bring it in here.  I hope I did.  Why?  Where's the...  Charles, who...  Are you mad at us, though?  No.  No.  God, no, man.  Not at all.  Who are you mad at?  Just the whole...  The whole, you know, guys calling in and stuff like that.  Yeah.  We get that, though, every day.  It happens, dude.  We get y'all that, too.  You know, you do put yourself out there, and it's like, I'm pretty easy to kick in the  balls, and I try to always guybosh the people trying to kick me in the balls beforehand. 
[03:21:30]  Yeah.  You know, and it's like...  That Steve guy calls every day, though.  Yeah, Steve calls us and bashes us every day.  You should hear what he says about us every day.  Steve in Yellowstone stinks, and that guy Ben in Boston's awful, if you understand what  he's saying.  They're like regular callers that we can't screen out that just call up and bash us and our guests  all the time.  Yeah.  Guy drives a hybrid car, for God's sake.  Enough said.  Yeah.  I just, you know, when you feel sick and, you know, you try to put it up there, it just, 
[03:22:00]  I don't know, man.  I feel like an uphill battle.  No, you did not.  Oh, you scumbag.  Holy shit.  He's talking about the uphill battle.  Click.  Oh, you didn't. 
[03:22:30]  Gotta give the guy credit, though.  I threw that entire poker chip thing at him, and he didn't even flinch.  He didn't even miss a...  He didn't even stop.  You can act like a man.  What's the matter with you?  Why is it Eric calling back?  Hopefully he's got a fist in his gum line.  Dude, I just shrunk.  She had fucking mayonnaise leaking out of his teeth. 
[03:23:00]  Good shot to the mouth.  Right now, that dummy is trying to explain why, like, the phone hung up, and it's still  showing the minutes they're taking.  Like, no, I...  Dude.  Yeah, let's get him back on the phone.  What happened?  Are you kidding?  Why'd he hang up on us?  Shh, shh.  Okay.  Eric, why do you...  Yeah, the phone must have cut out or something.  Ah, damn it.  All right.  Hold on.  That wasn't me hanging out. 
[03:23:30]  No?  All right.  We thought, because right when that happened, we were like, uh-oh, he's pissed.  Yeah, we don't want...  No, we don't want you going away mad, and we want to give you the final word here.  So, uh, Charles.  Charles.  Yeah, yeah, I know.  Charles.  So what were you saying?  Um, I don't know what it was.  I guess it's just...  You're saying you're feeling sick or something like that, and it's just about...  No, no, I've been...  Okay, I had to do, like, two shows yesterday, and it was, like, wolfing between the shows.  Uh, I don't know.  Everybody's got some kind of cold of some sort.  No, it was something about an uphill battle, and...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And you're easy to get to, and you're working on that or something like that? 
[03:24:00]  What's that?  You said something about, and the thought kind of got cut off, that you're easy to kick  in the balls, and you're going to get to, and you're feeling like you're going to be  an uphill battle.  I try doing this type of show here, right?  And, like, you know, sometimes trying to maintain a sense of, like, feeling good about  yourself.  You know, it's such a strange thing to be doing, because, like...  I can't be part of this. 
[03:24:30]  This show stinks.  You feel good about yourself.  Ka-ching.  You know.  Right now...  That's hard sometimes.  Click.  And right now, Eric is trying to explain why it once again cut off, and why the mouthpiece  smelt at the inside of a baby coffin. 
[03:25:00]  Ah...  Oh, jeez.  Breathe.  Nope.  All right.  Oh!  Oh, my God.  Eric, what happened?  He came back in.  He followed me in.  He wants to come back in.  Oh.  And we've moved.  All right.  Okay.  No, no, no.  Let me get out of the studio first, because I've got to call again.  Yeah.  Um...  You can tell him I want to...  No, keep his hand loose.  Just say...  Away from that window.  I know.  Where's Ben? 
[03:25:30]  Ben's in the back.  Dude!  What the hell is going on?  Oh, jeez.  There he is.  I don't know what's going on with the phone.  Were you in the elevator area?  No, I was going to the bathroom and it felt like I was puking.  Oh, no, that...  No.  Why?  No, it's not you guys at all, man.  Yeah.  I've had...  On my days off, I got to look after my girlfriend and our two friends that came from Victoria to  visit us.  And they were puking, like, lying down on, like, the couch and on the bed, just barfing 
[03:26:00]  in bags and stuff.  So...  What's Victoria?  Uh, Canada?  Yeah, British Columbia.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Where are you from up there?  Uh, Victoria.  Victoria?  Yeah, I live in Victoria, but, I mean, I was born in, uh, this place called Prince George,  B.C., which, did you ever see the movie Strange Brew?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, with, uh, Rick Moran.  That's all we know of Canada, is through Strange Brew.  Well, it was filmed in Prince George, B.C.  That's where I was born and where I kind of grew up until I was, like, 11 years old or  something.  And I watched...  Oh, thank you.  I'm not sure if they ever told you, but I'd watched the Star Wars trilogy, like, over 
[03:26:30]  400 times before I was 11 years old.  Oh, you did?  Mm-hmm.  Why?  It was just your thing?  We didn't have television.  We had a television.  We had a VCR.  And it was very cool when you were a kid.  I mean, I watched that movie, I can't even tell you how many times, too.  Uh-oh.  As a kid?  I mean, sitting there, you had the opening scene, first time you ever saw it?  Yeah, yeah.  It was the best thing ever.  Yeah, I know.  Of course.  But, I mean, I put it on, like, sort of as background noise.  Do you know what I mean?  Really?  In the morning.  Wait, you just had no TV?  Did you get the whole movie memorized? 
[03:27:00]  Uh, no.  Word for word, no?  I doubt it.  I doubt it.  I mean, when I wrote this, though, it was going from memory, rather than going back and watching  the films and trying to dress up.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So there could be some inaccuracies.  Oh, huge inaccuracies.  And you get people telling me that I've got this wrong, or that wording wrong, or something  wrong, and it's like, well, who cares?  They're probably dressed like Jedi with lightsabers and hands when they tell you this.  Oh, yeah, and I've met a lot of those people.  You've been to the conventions?  Well, just to perform, I've never actually been to a convention.  Yeah.  Outside of, uh...  Scary people.  Well, some, but a lot of these people have really normal jobs and normal lives, too, 
[03:27:30]  right?  Like, they just, they do normal things, except that this is their hobby.  So...  Well, you've got a lot of action on the phones.  I mean, they're just going crazy.  Oh, great.  We've got a call coming in from Riskless, Montana.  Well, let's do it.  This is Travis.  Travis!  Hey, sir, why are they giving you such a hard time?  I thought it was pretty good what you did.  All right.  Good.  Yeah, there you go.  See, that's positive.  I told you.  I'm a fan of the movie.  I mean, it's hard to find somebody that kind of knows everything about the movie, and everybody  thinks I'm a geek, but I like the movie.  Well, there's nothing wrong with that. 
[03:28:00]  People think I'm a geek, too.  How old were you when you started, like, watching the movies and stuff?  How old was I?  He said he saw the movie 400 times before he was 11, I think.  First time I saw it was in Waikiki.  We used to live between Waikiki and Prince George, so the first time I saw it was near  the Waikiki Banyan, if you've ever been to Waikiki.  What?  Why?  Did you just...  Ramon!  Oh, it's this guy again.  Did you just squeal off the road again, buddy?  Is this Steve...  Oh, it's got this guy. 
[03:28:30]  Ramon!  This guy's a black dick.  Why do the screeners...  No, this guy tricked us.  The screeners can't find out that that's not Travis.  Ramon!  Star Wars is a faggot.  All right, we get it.  Ramon!  Tell this guy...  Steve!  Steve, please lose the phone number.  Where do you live, man?  Ramon! 
[03:29:00]  Tell this faggot that Waikiki is unreal.  Holy shit, dude.  The guy's cracking himself up.  This is awesome.  All right, Steve.  Do you want my home number, fuckhead?  Really?  What?  You know, they're faceless people.  I love it.  Like message board people.  They have no face.  They love jumping in and bashing.  But they never want to confront anybody.  Come down to the studio. 
[03:29:30]  We'll kick your ass.  Yeah, why don't you come in the studio, buddy?  Steve.  Enough.  Go find your boyfriend, Ramon, or whatever the hell.  Why don't you come in the studio?  Dead balls.  All right, there he goes.  Jesus.  Sorry about that, buddy.  It's a daily battle on this show to deal with these assholes.  Brian Clifton, what's up?  Hey, this is Brian from Clifton Park.  Hey, Brian.  I saw him at Celebration 3.  I loved him.  I really did.  Oh, okay.  All this crap they're giving you is a bunch of bullshit.  Saw the show? 
[03:30:00]  Very talented.  I love the films.  You know, what people do, and it's a great film, and I can't believe that people are dissing  like this.  It's a bunch of jack-offs.  You're always going to get it.  Keep doing what you're doing.  I saw it at Celebration 3.  Keep it up.  I'm punching out.  You're always going to get the one or two.  What they call the bad apples.  So what is with Ramon?  I don't get it.  Every time this Steve guy calls, it's always about Ramon.  We still don't know what it means. 
[03:30:30]  But he actually listens to the radio and then bothers to call in.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what he does.  He actually listens and then calls in to Bash.  Is he like the, like you're sort of like, sort of village idiot, but like, sort of.  Every day.  Every day.  Every day.  Every day we got to deal with this shit.  Ramon.  Ramon.  Who cares, Ramon?  Dan in New Hampshire checking in.  Let's say hi to Liddy.  Liddy.  Hey, how are you doing?  Hello?  Liddy.  What's up, Liddy? 
[03:31:00]  Why's everybody giving this guy a hard time?  Liddy, you stink.  Ramon.  Ramon.  All right.  Get rid of it again.  Ramon.  Darth Vader has AIDS.  Holy shit, dude.  Stop.  Would you?  Why do you call?  Ramon.  T3PO should be molested.  Man.  Wash my balls.  He's got an, he's Liddy. 
[03:31:30]  Liddy and Ramon?  Like, what the hell?  Liddy.  This is Liddy.  Ramon.  He needs a, he needs a, he needs a, he needs a, he needs a, he needs a, he needs a, he needs  He needs a writer, obviously.  You got no material, dude.  Ramon.  Why are Ryan fans hiring that lazy bag of shit?  I don't even know what he's talking about.  All right.  Wow.  Thank you, Liddy.  Goddamn.  So he's like an honorary DJ, sort of like on the, on the. 
[03:32:00]  Honorary?  The eye in the sky or something like that.  For some reason, he's very good at getting past the screeners.  Let's go to the Ramon part.  Any more Steve from Yellowstone calls and you guys are done.  I mean, Jesus.  Check the caller ID.  Yeah.  Don't we have caller ID?  Ben, what's up?  Yo, what's up?  I want him to do Yoda eating Princess Leia's ass.  Ramon.  No, this is not Ramon.  Was that him?  Somebody totally new.  Yeah, do you do that, though?  Seriously, if you do all the voices, do you mess around with the voices a little bit? 
[03:32:30]  No, not really.  Do an alternate scene?  Well, no eating of Leia's ass.  No.  But that would be great.  Any other movies that you have in mind to take into this?  I was thinking of Terms of Endearment, maybe.  Terms of Endearment.  That would be great.  How about Blowing Chewbacca?  Blowing Chewbacca.  All right.  Let's say that.  Look at the size of that thing.  I think Star Wars, The Wrath of Khan.  Star Trek, The Wrath of Khan would probably be a good one.  Good choice.  Sonny Ferelli, what's up?  Hey, this guy's really good, man. 
[03:33:00]  Oh.  Ramon.  All right.  All right.  Hey, you know something?  Your book is doing an excellent job.  What's his name, Ramon?  Punching out.  That's not even Steve.  I don't even get that one.  All right.  Frenchie.  Hey, this guy isn't very good.  Why is everybody giving him shit?  Ramon.  Is that the real Frenchie?  Yes.  And you like it?  You like it?  Yes, I like him.  He's good.  Okay. 
[03:33:30]  He does a good job.  Come to my restaurant.  Oh, plug your restaurant.  Ramon, this guy sucks.  Ramon.  Ramon, bring this guy.  His self-inflicted gunshot wound.  All right.  Look.  Ramon.  I've had it.  I have had it.  Bring me a hybrid vehicle.  You really got to bring this guy on, man.  Bring me a belly the size of a change purse. 
[03:34:00]  Jesus Christ.  Look.  Shave my arms.  All right.  Thank you, Frenchie.  Fuck you.  All right.  Thanks.  Jesus.  All right.  Well, Charles.  Charles Ross.  Charles, again.  Star Wars show.  Again, thank you very much.  Also, I believe in the new year, we're going to be opening up the one-man Lord of the Rings  probably in the same space as well.  Right here in New York? 
[03:34:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Very cool.  Can you give us a little taste of that?  Sure.  We wants it.  We needs it.  Must have the precious.  Master is our friend.  You don't have any friends.  Nobody likes you.  I'm not listening.  You're a liar and a thief.  Nope.  Murderer.  I hate you.  What are you with me?  Home.  Home.  It was me.  We survived because of me.  Not anymore.  What?  We don't need you. 
[03:35:00]  Leave now and never come back.  Leave now and never come back.  Anyway.  Wow.  That's pretty damn good.  No more chips than me, though.  It was good.  That's...  Well, it's really cool, though.  It was the guy who played Gandalf, Ian McKelm, came and saw the show when I did it.  Really?  Yeah, it was weird.  That is weird.  He actually really liked it.  Yeah, I mean, it's been a really strange thing, man. 
[03:35:30]  Going from doing just sort of the comedy sketch thing to suddenly playing with the big boys  or having to suddenly be in the scrutiny of Steve.  Of the likes of a Steve from Yellowstone.  That would be a little nerve-wracking, though, having Ian McKelm there.  Yeah, I guess so.  I mean, because he's like an actor.  He was in the movie.  Yeah, exactly.  So, you know, if he hated it, then I'd feel like crap or just sort of feel worse.  And sometimes, you know, you do when Steve calls you Ramon or whatever it is.  Yeah, Ramon every goddamn day. 
[03:36:00]  How about The Matrix?  I don't know.  Yeah.  The Matrix would probably work.  It could work.  It's kind of hard to find, like, a show that's that popular.  You know, like Star Wars, Lord of the Rings is super popular.  But I think in terms of Endearment, if they put out one more, man, it'll be right up there.  Fried Green Tomatoes.  I was thinking maybe the Muppets.  In Madison County.  You bet.  That's a good one.  What's up, Jimmy?  Did he get the...  Yeah, he's getting the auction stuff altogether.  Yeah, okay.  Cool.  Very good.  All right, we're going to say goodbye to Charles.  I do have to bring the other stuff in, though, which I will bring in, the stuff from the 
[03:36:30]  FCD, which I can bring in.  Yeah, right on.  All right.  Charles did a great job for us.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you so much.  Feel better.  All right, I will.  I hope so.  All right.  Cheers.  See you.  What's up?  This is Dane Cook.  You're listening to The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  There are so many people that show up every day just to hang and check out the show, friends  of people, I don't know, fans that hang out outside all night, and we say, all right,  come on in and check out the show.  And most people you never even hear on mic.  They're just there kind of checking it out, and we say hi after the show, and we go about 
[03:37:00]  our lives.  But every once in a while, people that are coming down just to hang become part of the  show.  And Gavin is part of the show because I walk in the studio from a leak break, and everyone's  checking out this sick video that's on your cell phone.  The things we do back home.  So now we have to talk about it a little bit.  Explain what this fantastic video is.  Well, it's basically me and my couple of buddies went to a swingers party in England, and my  friend ended up getting banged up the ass with a strap-on dildo. 
[03:37:30]  Your friend got banged up the ass with a strap-on.  Wait, you guys just go to a swingers party?  Yeah.  That's the kind of thing we do, you know.  Instead of getting bombed before we go to a party and get bombed ourself.  Had he ever gotten...  I can't confirm that.  You don't know if he's gotten it in the ass before?  I don't think so.  Not from the screams.  No.  Why would you decide that?  Not from the screams.  Yeah.  This guy lets out some howls.  Well, the thing is, it's a dominatrix, and she's got a strap-on. 
[03:38:00]  That's correct.  And she's the one that's screwing him in the ass with a strap-on.  There you go.  But behind her is somebody.  There you go.  That's fucking her.  There you go.  So with every thrust the guy does to her, she's doing a thrust with the strap-on, so  she can't be very gentle to this guy, and this guy is just, ah, like getting hammered,  and it sounds painful.  And Gavin's just filming the whole thing on his cell phone.  And you hear Gavin laughing.  I can hear you laughing like an idiot.  And then I'm watching the video, and I see the girl in the middle, and I had to blurt 
[03:38:30]  out, she's the lucky one.  Yeah, where did this slob come from?  It was all down in London about two months ago.  Yeah?  And she was just at this ringer party?  She was just at a party, yeah, and she just decided to come back with us to the hotel.  She had like a box of toys to display things with us as well.  So I've got a little shit on here as well that I can show you.  You know, if there's a chick, and she comes back to the hotel, and she's got a box of toys,  the last thing I'm thinking is, hey, could you strap that on and put it up my ass? 
[03:39:00]  That's the last thing I was thinking as well.  How do you get to that point?  You guys are all hanging in the hotel room.  Were you drunk?  Yeah, we was all drunk, and it's a filthy week.  Look, I've been drunk.  Yeah, that is no excuse.  Like, did you have any inkling that he might enjoy something like this?  No, he actually volunteered for it, you know?  He was like, what are we going to do with this?  Oh, you know what?  I'll get fucked in the ass with this, no problem.  Who wants it in the ass?  Right here. 
[03:39:30]  Me.  Volunteers.  All right.  Why don't we listen to a little of it?  Let's see if I can get it on the...  What, I'll just put it to the mug door?  Yeah.  We'll all be quiet and listen in on the audio at least.  It's got to be to the front.  Yeah, do the front.  Like that.  Yeah, put it right against it.  It's got to be shit, but it's gone.  Maybe I'm...  You know, we do a little of it.  That's a little of it, well, that's it, that's it.  There you go.  Well, well, it's like we've fucked a bit up. 
[03:40:00]  In your bunghole.  In your bunghole.  Can't read some film, Gary.  I don't know.  That's fine, I don't know.  All right, that's it, Dave.  Why don't you fuck...  No, wait, hang on.  Let me just get it in his bum first.  Get it in his bum first.  The job and Mrs. Guilford, the only one.  And Lloyd, he's just going to get involved there.  Is this the negotiation going on?  Yeah, it's about the, you know, woman or...  I like the prelim, Mrs. Guilford. 
[03:40:30]  Because calling her by her first name would be rude.  English of us.  So he's having a hard time with it.  It's a big deal, though, man.  It's being fucking...  It's good, brother.  Oh, good fucking God. 
[03:41:00]  Why is it nice on the earth?  It's like my fucking eyes.  Get me a towel, it's covered in shit.  See how many it's his first time, you can tell. 
[03:41:30]  It's too late. 
[03:42:00]  It's too late.  There you go.  Get in your fucking ride.  Good luck, good luck, sorry.  That's what I'm talking about.  That's what I'm talking about. 
[03:42:30]  Fucking hell.  That's too much, though.  Oh, that's great.  That guy was not comfortable with that situation.  What's worse than being raped in the ass and hurting when your friend laughing at you?  Filming it.  Just cackling.  Fucking hell.  Oh. 
[03:43:00]  This is what I should look in the morning as well.  Oh, my God.  She kills a hero.  She's a real trooper.  Give me a towel in case there's shit on it.  Shit on it.  Practical gal.  Yeah, that's what he's out of the way.  Oh.  Hey, Nate.  Eight is bald.  Morning, guys.  What's up, Nate?  Yeah, I know we're not playing, but on the gay or funny scale, this is most certainly gay. 
[03:43:30]  It's gay and funny.  It's gay and funny, yes.  Over and out, guys.  All right.  All right.  Wow.  Well, Gavin, thank you.  You're welcome.  The accent kind of gives a little air of dignity.  Yeah.  Yeah, doesn't it?  No matter what the English are doing.  Just a little air of touch.  No matter how perverse the English are being, it's done in that accent.  Yeah.  It's just something charming about it.  When he wrote Strawberry Fields, Paul fucked me in the air.  Yes.  Make sure I'm putting it in his bum.  That guy was a fucking trooper.  Wow.  How was he? 
[03:44:00]  Did you drive him home?  Oh, yeah, he could walk.  He could walk.  Yeah, he's a trooper.  Face first in the backseat, crying.  There's fucking a face.  Costumes in his ass.  Horrible.  This is a very special show.  It's about being able to do the show we want to do.  Prison sex.  Give it to me.  We know what guys want to hear on the radio.  Adult-oriented subject matter.  Look at those chugs.  You opio pucho cine megalo que homerfo.  They won't exercise restraint.  This is going to be an awful show. 
[03:44:30]  Hold on tight, kid.  The O.B. and Anthony Show. </pre>
