<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts, Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, engaging in self-deprecating humor, using offensive terms to describe themselves. Norton promoted his upcoming Dallas improv show, detailing the scheduling challenges of coordinating flights around the radio show.  They expressed nervousness about their impending appearance on David Letterman, a recurring theme throughout the broadcast.

The show then shifted to a recap of the previous night's MTV VMAs, recounting interactions with celebrities like Snoop Dogg (a photo was shared), and detailing Norton's varying success in obtaining celebrity photos (Snoop Dogg was cooperative, Busta Rhymes was not).  This transitioned into a discussion of Opie's "sports curse," his uncanny ability to jinx teams he predicted to win, leading to conversation about the US Open, Maria Sharapova's attire and on-court noises, and a New York Daily News article highlighting their nervousness about the Letterman appearance.  They further discussed their anxieties, past Letterman appearances (including one with Dave Chappelle), attempted to create new catchphrases, and speculated on their exclusion from live broadcasting at the VMAs, suggesting possible demographic reasons.  Excerpts from the Daily News review were read aloud.

A significant portion focused on Carlos Mencia's recent stand-up performance, with Mencia himself as a guest in studio. He shared his performance anxieties and an anecdote about a mentally-challenged fan.  Opie and Anthony reminisced about their own early radio blunders and catchphrases ("a boo-boo-boo" and "zero").  The conversation devolved into a highly offensive discussion about the *Survivor* controversy, General Motors' ad pullout, and stereotypical portrayals of various ethnic groups, referencing a newspaper article about Black drowning rates and using numerous racial slurs and stereotypes.  They speculated about how different racial groups would perform in *Survivor* challenges, also touching upon upcoming show details, ticket prices, and guest appearances (Jim Norton and Patrice O'Neill).  A fawning fan call interrupted the discussion.  Brief mention was made of the Letterman appearance and an upcoming Otto video. Jason Statham was briefly in studio, but a planned stunt fell through due to miscommunication, resulting in a humorous exchange.

Jason Statham's extended guest appearance followed, focusing on his career, stunts (including a helicopter skid fight scene), driving skills in movies, and his early life selling goods in London before connecting with Guy Ritchie.  Numerous callers phoned in, some providing inaccurate film information. Edward Norton then called in, exciting the hosts, especially given Jim Norton's presence.  They discussed Edward Norton's new film (*The Illusionist*), Letterman appearances, flying, and acting methods.  An unplanned encounter with a crying baby and its grandmother occurred. The post-show discussion involved a publicist's dissatisfaction with Statham's portrayal and the unfulfilled stunt, along with further discussion of the Letterman appearance.

The show continued with preparations for the Letterman appearance, including discussions about standby tickets (and morbid humor about deceased or unaware tourists), a frustrating call to Ed Norton, and their cursing policy (referencing a guest named Jason on CBS).  A humorous anecdote about someone almost getting hit by a car at Dealey Plaza, followed by discussion of a suicide at the same location, was shared. Their upcoming Dallas trip, including potential Dealey Plaza and strip club visits, was discussed, interspersed with a listener call, discussion of Rich Vos and Bonnie's tense radio exchange, and a lengthy debate on male versus female comedians.  Listener polls from Iliketolisten.com were referenced, along with audio clips (a skateboard fall, the "Grape Lady" video, and a CNN anchor's bathroom conversation).  A listener poll discussion about whatâ€™s worse (getting kicked in the balls or the wind knocked out) followed, along with promotions and calls. A listener promised 8,000 Twinkies for the Letterman show.  They also discussed a commercial they filmed, mentioning an unaired version with the word "ass."

The final segment focused again on the Letterman appearance, anxieties, and planned greetings (from subtle to offensive waves).  A previous wardrobe malfunction was mentioned. Their upcoming "traveling virus" comedy tour, particularly the potentially final Cleveland show (details on opianathday.com), was discussed, including extra comedians for the Philly show (Dom Iwera and Jimmy Schubert).  Logistical details for Letterman, such as the $1000 payment, 8000 Twinkies, and potential black eyes, were covered. Otto offered to cancel a gig for the Cleveland show.  Future plans including an FHM photoshoot, an iMac/MacBook contest, a potential Eagles cheerleader appearance, and a mattress giveaway in Philly were mentioned.  A listener request for a different show ("Than and Sam") was addressed, and the show ended with banter about a prank ("Hawk").


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show on XM202 featuring O.P., Anthony, and James Norton.  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country. Creeps, ankle biters.  Obviously the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long!  Shut up!  Alright, here we go. 
[00:00:30]  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible. I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  And we're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch, corn balls, three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM.  Opie.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm gay.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed. 
[00:01:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Enough palaver.  Yeah.  Good morning.  I should complain more about my headphones.  What's wrong with your headphones?  I don't know.  I always got to fiddle with it.  I got to fiddle with the little jack down there. 
[00:01:30]  Got to pull it out a little bit.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Put it back in a little bit.  A loose connection, right?  Yeah.  So glad it's freezing in here once again.  It always is.  Socks.  Good morning and welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  The O and A virus.  It's spreading across America.  Our phone number is 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE. 
[00:02:00]  A very busy day today for the boys.  Very busy indeed.  Jimmy's flying today.  He's doing the improv in Addison.  Down there in Dallas all weekend long.  Yeah, I think we leave probably right after the walkover and we'll have to move the flight.  Dallas flights are weird.  We're trying to get the flights you want back and forth.  Oh, we don't have XM, Jimmy, today?  I might have a little bit there, yeah.  Oh, a little bit.  The flights are not...  We don't have XM today.  Yeah, true.  We got a busy day. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, my God.  Sure you got it.  I'm not kidding.  We're doing a short show today.  We want to take today off.  But they're like, no, it would be smart to do the radio show and pump your appearance on David Letterman.  That's right.  Blah, blah, blah, yeah.  They just want to get more work out of us.  Of course.  We're working like dogs.  Well.  So we'll promote Letterman a little bit.  We'll say goodbye to Jimmy.  He'll go to the airport.  So long, I say.  So long.  Arrivederci.  Because, you know, I'll be seeing you. 
[00:03:00]  You know, again.  In all the familiar places.  Yeah, well, oh, there you go.  I'll be seeing you, a song from A Little Picture, 1933.  Best callback in the history of television is Swat, Dung, Doo-Doo-Doo-Doo-Doo-Doo-Doo-Doo-Doo.  Whoever wrote that is a genius.  I'm a head not.  Anyway, it's good to know that David Letterman knows exactly who we are. 
[00:03:30]  Oh.  Uh-oh.  This is from last night's program.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  What happened?  What happened?  I think so.  Okay, go.  How about those guys, Paul?  They were a cute band.  Very nice band.  Very nice band, yeah.  Charlie Hill.  Our thanks to Charlie Hill.  Snoop.  Dog.  Always a pleasure.  And Ron Patrick for setting fire at everybody's lawn.  Now, tomorrow, Julianne Moore will be here.  She's in a motion picture called Trust the Man.  Opens on Friday.  Opiny and Anthony.  Opiny.  Opiny.  Opiny and Anthony. 
[00:04:00]  I said Opiny and Anthony.  Yeah, you did, yeah.  Opiny and Anthony.  Opiny and Anthony.  Yeah, they'll be here.  It's a little bit hotter.  Yeah, and that's the show.  Good night, everybody.  Opiny.  Opiny.  Is that the same thing that Leno says?  Yeah, people have a problem with that.  Reading it, it's the Opiny and the end.  It is quite possibly the worst radio duo name to have because it is impossible to say.  We never thought it was that hard to say, though.  How many times have people said Opiny and Anthony in the evening?  Oh, a million times. 
[00:04:30]  A million times.  I guess the instinct, I don't know why it happens, that Leno says the same.  Yeah.  We might be reading it.  I've heard it from so many people over the years.  Opiny.  Oh, Opiny and Anthony.  They, like, kind of skip ahead to Anthony in the beginning of their Opiny.  Maybe your eye reads cue cards faster.  They can't wait to get to your name.  I know.  They just can't wait.  It's like, let's skip right over this part and get to Anthem and Anthony.  What the hell happened?  Well, then they start your name and realize that they didn't finish the Opiny part, so 
[00:05:00]  it's Opiny.  Open him, knee.  Very good.  Did he say thanks, Snoop Dogg?  Snoop did let me?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Snoop was on last night.  Of course, right before I was talking.  All right.  Yeah, before you were chit-chatting with him.  Well, I'm looking at a picture of Lil Jimmy Norton and Snoop Dogg.  Yeah.  Men of the same ilk.  A couple of guys who think alike.  You share no ilk with that man.  You are so ilk-less when it comes to his ilk.  I've never smelled a man that actually smelled like a lit joint before. 
[00:05:30]  Really?  He smelled like pot.  Well, he just supposedly smokes all the time he's stoned.  It was just, I haven't smoked pot in almost 20 years, but it was a smell of like, of good pot.  Of course.  Of course.  And his entourage, I was telling you guys as we were starting, because you couldn't, I went to that press conference.  Do you think you're going to get some homegrown from him?  Yeah, not a lot of seeds.  Yeah, you're getting some good pot when you're smoking with the Snoop.  You shake the album, a tree falls off. 
[00:06:00]  Probably sleeps in it.  Yeah, a pot-filled mattress.  Yeah, he's probably got a-  Everything he has is just made of pot.  That picture, Jimmy's very happy.  I'm looking at it right now.  Oh, look at him.  I got it.  Is it going to be up on opianathlete.com?  It's on your MySpace account, Jimmy?  My MySpace thing.  It's one of the hardest shots I've ever gotten, because you see the W he's got.  I'm trying to see what he's doing with his hand.  He's making a west side W.  It looks like a W, yeah, but I don't-  That's a gang sign.  Opie pointed out that you can't see Jimmy's hands from here.  Well, you can see the one now that I look closely. 
[00:06:30]  They're kind of holding hands.  Oh, you're holding it, you're shaking.  Were you making a gang sign with the other hand?  Yes, it was like, I had my wrist, and it was bent, and it was the Monster Reigns from when I was young.  Monster Reigns, how do you do that with one hand, because you're shaking me up?  Oh, yeah.  I was figuring you'd make an A and then an H, and that would be who you're with.  That's very hurtful.  His entourage.  You ever see a- I've never really watched a rap entourage walk into a room before, and there's all celebrities down there. 
[00:07:00]  There were a lot of them.  You ever seen a bank robbery?  Pretty much the same.  Wait, where were you, Jimmy?  I went to the TV.  They had the VMAs later, so I went to the press thing yesterday just to see who was going to be there.  Roland got me, and I actually did some interviews, and man, a lot of fans of the show.  Yeah?  A lot.  It's weird being back on in New York.  I forgot, like, oh, yeah, it's the radio.  And I can't tell you how many people working for MTV walked up to me and go, dude, love the show, love the show.  Or how many hot chicks walked up. 
[00:07:30]  My boyfriend loves the show.  Yeah, there you go.  Thanks.  We're turning some of them around.  Oh, yeah, but, I mean, they were aware.  They were all aware of it.  And there was a lot of celebrities there, but when Snoop walked in, it was an event.  And he had- I've never seen bigger men than the guys that were guarding.  Really?  I guess in places-  He needs it, yeah.  You can't have guns, and they wand you.  So these guys get physically imposing guys.  You think even his security can't have guns?  Yeah, they don't care.  No. 
[00:08:00]  Absolutely not.  Yeah?  Inside the event, no.  You would think if you're, like, a licensed kind of protective service kind of guy, I mean, if George W. Bush walked in there, guns would be allowed.  Maybe cops.  Maybe the legal thing.  I don't know.  I don't know what the law is, but I mean, these guys, they were too big to have-  They would hold a gun and just squeeze like, er, er.  They don't need guns.  I've never seen bigger men in their life.  Yeah, those guys are so big, they laugh at guns.  Don't shoot them.  Just make them angry.  It would be like a cartoon bullet if it hit one of these guys. 
[00:08:30]  If you do, I'll give you such a pinch.  Yeah, they were very, very frightening guys.  The only guy that blew me off was Busta Rhymes.  Why?  I don't know.  Busta seems like a fun guy.  He's like, talk to my man.  Oh, because I interrupted him.  He's trading numbers with the girl.  I say digits, my friend.  Trading some digits.  I thought he said, I swear to God, I thought he said something about Louie, like Lucky  Louie.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  He was saying, excuse me, like, could you give me a second?  Excuse me sounded like Louie?  It was loud.  And I just wanted to believe.  Yeah.  That he watched is your show. 
[00:09:00]  So he said it one more time, and then I walked in and shook his hand, and he goes, excuse me  for a minute.  Oh, no.  He's an intimidating guy, so I was like, oh.  You do get aggressive, though, Jimmy.  I know.  With your celebrity photos.  You're ruining it for whitey.  You're ruining it for whitey.  Like, now he gets the impression that all white people are like you.  Oh, you know.  All pushy.  He deals with the record executives.  That's true.  You know, the supersteins.  He understands.  And Method Man, big fan of Lucky Louie, so thank you.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I think I should win an Emmy. 
[00:09:30]  Wow, that'd be nice.  He's a lovely gentleman.  He's the only guy that recognized me that was really famous.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Kind of hurt, but he was great.  Jimmy was walking around hoping he would be recognized by big celebrities.  It was just, I couldn't say Lucky Louie.  With that hoping look in your eyes.  Yeah.  I look at them a half second longer than they look at me, like, just hoping they'll go,  oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh.  No.  And nothing.  No.  No.  Well, you got some good pictures, then.  Ludicrous was nice.  The XM guys were good.  That's what got me the Snoop picture was the XM tie-in. 
[00:10:00]  So it was fun.  That Snoop one's a biggie.  Yeah, man.  He's a tough one.  Yeah.  He's a tough dude to get, but I'm annoyed I didn't get Busta Rhymes.  Did he say anything to you?  I'm 38 years old and I'm having this conversation.  Yeah.  Well, you collect photos of celebrities.  He blew me off, but then he goes, talk to my man.  I just want to get a photo with him.  He goes, talk to my man.  His guy.  I've got a big dude with him.  So I asked the guy, and the guy asked me, you've never heard talking like I did yesterday?  I would just leave.  Why?  Like, talk to my man.  I'd be like, all right, that means no, and walk away. 
[00:10:30]  All right, thank you.  You pursue it.  Well, I talked to this guy, and this guy goes, who are you?  I go, I'm with the Opie and Anthony show.  They're on radio.  He goes, I've heard of them.  I know them.  And I go, okay, we're doing this thing with the VMAs.  I'm getting pictures of what we're talking about.  Anything I could say.  And most people don't want to hear it anyway.  They think you are somebody because you actually have an answer for them.  Yeah.  Like, if they go, who are you?  Oh, Finn.  Forget it.  Gone.  Oh, I'm with Finn.  I'm with Finn.  Little thin white lips just moving.  He's like, all right.  But it didn't work.  He made me wait and wait and wait, and I think Bust just didn't want to do it. 
[00:11:00]  So how many pictures did you end up getting?  I don't know.  You got the Snoop.  Snoop.  I got Ludacris.  I got Young Jock.  The Roots are popular, these guys, The Roots.  Yeah, The Roots are up there.  I got them.  I got Nick Totoro and a few other guys.  Oh, Nick was there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I like him a lot.  He's a psychopath.  Yeah, he really looks nuts.  He walked up and...  No, he's...  Are you watching Celebrity Fit Club at all?  Oh, no.  Is he on that?  Wait, there's two brothers.  Which is the more famous?  John is more famous.  Okay, yeah.  Nick is on Celebrity Fit Club. 
[00:11:30]  He's a psychopath.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Oh, he's out of his mind.  Yeah, he was...  He was...  If you don't know who Nick Totoro is, he was in NYPD Blue, and he was great in Jungle Fever.  He played a little...  Both of them were in that one.  Oh, you're right.  You're right.  Oh, yes.  I didn't realize it was his brother.  Yeah, they played brothers in that one, I believe.  No.  They didn't?  They played guys that hate each other.  I thought they were brothers that were always, like, kicking each other's ass.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Oh, come on.  Stop calling me.  I'm on the radio, you.  Is that Snoop? 
[00:12:00]  It probably is.  He wants to say, hey, let's crack out.  Why don't you come in and do a few minutes with us?  Yeah.  Did he talk to you at all, Snoop?  Was it just kind of like...  No, he was okay.  He just shook hands, man.  Hey, come on in.  He looked...  No.  No, no, no.  No, I was trying to get him.  The first time I tried to get him, he goes, I got to take a picture with these girls.  And he took a picture of the hottest chicks in the room.  Of course.  He's just a cool dude.  I understand why chicks bang him.  Snoop.  I mean, he's just got a vibe to him.  We've had him on the show a couple times.  Yeah, yeah.  Never in studio, but on the phone.  He's really, really cool.  I'd be frightened in studio.  It's funny.  These guys dwarfed Kenny. 
[00:12:30]  They dwarfed Hulk Hogan, the guys he had.  I mean, Hulk was there, and Hulk's a big dude.  Oh, don't.  Look at what you're doing.  Why?  Hulk was nice.  Look at what you're doing to E-Rock.  I actually talked to him.  He's crying.  He's crying.  Because you're saying something.  What a hero.  That's his hero, and you're saying things that aren't good.  I have pictures of all his heroes.  I have pictures of Opie, and I have pictures of Hulk.  All of them.  Seems to be a drop-off there somewhere.  Let's be honest.  Well, while you were doing that, Jimmy, I was mellowing out, and I was watching Rockstar, Supernova. 
[00:13:00]  This is classic.  We don't really talk about the show a lot.  It's a pretty cool show, though.  It really is.  Basically, you get a bunch of Rockstar hopefuls, and they live in a mansion.  You know the gig.  It's another reality show.  And slowly but surely, they vote people out, and eventually there's going to be a lead singer that will be singing for this band, Supernova, which is Tommy Lee, Jason Newstead, and Gilby Clark. 
[00:13:30]  Well, on our XM show, I guess a couple days ago, we talked to Ryan Starr.  Ryan Starr, who was doing very well.  Yeah, they're down to six, and Ryan Starr is one of the six, and he called our show to promote Rockstar.  And he's a Long Island kid.  He's from where we grew up in, Huntington.  Huntington, Long Island.  Huntington, Long Island.  It turned out he's a huge fan of the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  We were talking about the rock clubs back in the day and this and that.  And him playing a lot of the same dives. 
[00:14:00]  We're relating and all that.  And then at the end of the interview, I said this to Ryan Starr.  Ryan, hear me now.  You're going to win the whole thing.  I'll tell you why.  Why is that?  There's six finalists left.  Two of them are chicks, so goodbye to the chicks.  Tommy Lee is not going to have a chick lead singer.  Yeah.  Jason Newstead is not going to have a chick lead singer.  Gilby, maybe.  Maybe.  So then you're down to the four finalists. 
[00:14:30]  Sure.  All right.  Cool.  And here's the end of Rockstar last night.  Well, it's down to the three of you.  And I just want to tell you guys, you guys are all really great.  I mean, everybody tonight was awesome.  But in the end, it's all about what's best for us here.  And Ryan, after nine weeks, dude, you're probably the only cat who's come the farthest. 
[00:15:00]  Like, you know.  But I'm sorry to say this.  Unfortunately, Ryan, you're the next to go, brother.  I'm sorry.  Oh, good call, Ope.  Good call.  Oh, Jesus.  And for the new listeners, they really don't understand how deep this goes. 
[00:15:30]  Because when I was saying that he's going to win the whole thing the other day, I'm thinking  to myself, why am I jinxing this guy?  You're totally jinxing him.  Because I now believe in the Opie curse.  Well, it worked.  You guaranteed him a victory.  A victory.  And he was knocked out the very next show.  The last thing Opie said to Hitler was, don't worry, Steiner's men will mount the offensive.  It'll all work out.  You just hold up here in the bunker.  You'll be fine in no time.  We'll come and get you when this all blows over. 
[00:16:00]  It's usually a sports curse.  Every team I pick.  Every team in every sport always loses.  I notice this whole season, you really haven't been pushing the Mets.  And they are kicking ass.  I say stuff like, wouldn't it be nice to see the Mets and the Red Sox in the World Series?  Wouldn't it be nice isn't they are going to.  Sorry, we're being hurt in Detroit.  Detroit doesn't want to hear this.  But the only reason I say that is because 20 years later, how cool would that be?  Yeah. 
[00:16:30]  You get the Red Sox and the Mets going at it again.  Why, Tigers having a good year?  They're the best team in baseball.  I haven't watched it all this year.  The best team in baseball.  They're the best team in baseball.  And then I think Mets are second, I believe.  I think at this point now, because what are the Mets, like 15 games in front?  Jimmy's very busy this morning.  I think you could pretty much guarantee the Mets going all the way, right?  Might as well say it.  I'm not saying anything.  Go ahead, O.  Just say it about your team. 
[00:17:00]  Say the Mets are going all the way.  No, because I know you're a Yankee fan.  I'm not falling for that.  I just want to hear you say that.  I'm not falling for that.  No, no, no.  Yeah.  Poor Ryan.  Yeah, but the listeners were the ones that picked up on the sports curse because we weren't  even thinking about it.  I was just making my predictions, whatever.  And then finally, the listeners picked up on it and said, you know, O.  Every team you pick is losing here.  And so then we started keeping track and it just got really ugly.  Got worse and worse.  And we're talking like favorites, like they weren't supposed to lose. 
[00:17:30]  Yep.  And they're getting, you know, their asses kicked.  Really started with hockey, with the Islanders.  Wow.  He's a big Islander fan.  Wow.  They're just like.  We're in the middle of the lean years.  Yeah, yeah.  So that's not really a big point.  But I mean, even before the lean years, weren't you like, I remember you pushing for the Islanders  like years and years ago.  Nah, the Islanders haven't been, you know, that good for many, many years.  Yeah. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  That's probably not the best example, to be honest.  Well, oh, there she is, Maria Sharapova.  She's in her little, what looks like a nightgown.  She played tennis in a nightgown.  Little sparkly things, long earrings.  Like, what's what, I understand she is stunning, but aren't you supposed to play tennis and  like, aren't you supposed to look like you're playing a sport?  She looks like she is out on the town. 
[00:18:30]  Well, that's what's cool about the US Open.  They let them have some personality.  It's those dopes across the pond in Wimbledon.  Yes, Wimbledon.  Where you have to wear white.  Is that it?  Oh, yeah.  To do that, because she was wearing an evening gown.  Yeah, US Open, you can rock and roll.  You can wear pretty much anything.  It's all glittery.  She had these big, long earrings on.  Just looking hot.  And then she makes noises, too, when she hits the ball, which is, you know, some tennis  players.  Who was the one that really used to scream? 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, Monica Stelis?  Yeah.  Monica Stelis started that track.  That ain't hot.  But when Maria Sharapova kind of moans when she hits the wall, it's hot.  Can we get her moaning, please?  Yeah, get a little bit of her moaning.  For tomorrow's show or maybe today's show.  Yeah.  Yeah, the US Open's in town, and all the tennis players are walking right around where  we broadcast.  Yeah.  They're all over the place in all their hotness. 
[00:19:30]  Yes.  In all their hotness.  You see, you guys have a nice article on the Daily News.  You saw that, right?  Yeah, we can talk about it next.  That's cool.  Stupid Hinkley.  Why, did he mess something up?  Stupid Hinkley.  You know, Ian and I and Jimmy, we've decided to maybe show a different emotion that we do  have in our bodies, and everyone's picking up on it.  Did we?  Well, the whole Whoopi Goldberg, people thought we should have smashed her.  Yeah.  And we were brave enough to admit we were just being honest, and like, we didn't have  a personal problem with her, so when she surprised us at XM, we kind of fell apart 
[00:20:00]  and were really nice to her and stuff, and we all got along.  Yeah, because we didn't get up and smack her in the face.  I mean, what were we supposed to do?  Come on.  I still think her radio show stinks.  Well, yes.  But I think she's a great comic, a very good comic, a very edgy comic, but her radio show  is awful.  I haven't listened to it.  I honestly have not either.  I stopped talking about it.  Right.  And now, you know, we admit that we're a little nervous about going on Letterman tonight, 
[00:20:30]  so if that's not bad enough, David Hinckley has to write a whole article about how he's  been listening to us lately, and he writes an article about how nervous we are.  Yeah.  Thanks, David.  You know what?  Why don't we take a break, and we'll read some of the article.  Just the title of the article, Opie and Anthony sweat that first date with Dave.  Sweat.  Are we sweating?  Let me feel.  No.  Sweat, almost like, I don't sweat you.  No, I've turned the corner, man.  Sweating it.  I'm psyched. 
[00:21:00]  I am so psyched.  I got a good night's sleep.  My mouth is working for once.  Ooh.  Yeah.  That'll be handy.  Yes.  I'm ready to go.  Yeah.  We just got to do this stupid radio show.  Oh, do you mean the reason we're on?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Shouldn't talk about being nervous.  Just be tough.  That's it.  Go have fun.  Hey, Dave.  What do you got?  Yeah.  Go ahead, Dave.  Go.  Go.  Hey, Dave, the war.  Go.  See, he's a human being. 
[00:21:30]  He can't even say our names right, so.  Open E.  And I'm going to picture him in his underpants.  Brady Bunch logic.  I'm going with Brady.  Marsha taking a road test.  I'm going with Brady Bunch logic, yes.  Wait, was that from the Brady Bunch?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, in his underwear, the driving instructor, when she had to take a little driver's test.  And then she was all nervous, but then she looked to her right, and she started smiling,  because next thing you know, there he is, sitting there in his underpants.  And unfortunately, later, her father was found with the driver in their underpants.  And we all know what happened there. 
[00:22:00]  I just picture him in his robe, and it's just funnier.  A cup of broth in his hand.  All right, we're going to take a break.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  All I want is to get laid and eat sandwiches.  That's it.  That's the closest reference you can get to something cool.  We're all hip and groovy.  We're all hip and groovy.  Ha, ha, ha.  Dick.  Yeah.  Where do you go when you're unchangeable?  See, I hope you're there for the show.  I want to be on you.  Well, you've come to the right place.  I help you, you help me, we all laugh.  Don't worry, we're not listening, because this is a boring conversation. 
[00:22:30]  I just love you too, sweetie.  If you walk past them, don't you take your jewelry, take your purse, you know what I mean now?  You have no idea what they are.  There are a lot of questions about them.  Real.  Dirty looking.  Freaking up.  Shut up.  Bring on the booze.  Is this the ONA virus ending the show?  Yes.  Okay.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  ONA Uncut and live.  Continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe. 
[00:23:00]  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  You're checking out the O.B. and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  A big day for the boys today.  Lots of things going on.  Jim Norton's going to be on a plane in a few hours heading to Dallas.  He's doing the improv in Addison.  That's a great club.  I've been there a few times.  I love it.  I actually miss those guys in Pugs and Kelly a lot.  Are you doing the Pugs and Kelly show? 
[00:23:30]  I hope tomorrow.  I don't know if they're around.  I haven't talked to them.  I did a cloner with them.  And is it hard to hear, by the way, that my ears just clogged?  I don't know.  Your mic's sounding a little weird, actually.  Is it a little low?  No, you're all right on the radio.  But you trying to talk over the music, I don't know.  The music is blasting you out today for some reason.  Maybe a little tweak and we'll be back in business here.  Yeah, I think something happened when Korn played yesterday.  Like, they did something with headphones.  Yeah.  Because I don't sound as loud in mine either, but it's okay. 
[00:24:00]  We got rave reviews on the Korn thing yesterday.  Those two songs they played were unbelievable.  We always get gypped here in the studio because the live, actual, just them playing live,  listening to that isn't what goes out over the radio.  You know, they're singing at the mics and stuff, and we hear it kind of live, you know?  Yeah.  So we get gypped.  But everybody that was listening out there, hearing it said it sounded great.  Yeah, I was in a panic because you take your headphones off, and it sounds like Jonathan  Davis is, like, singing, like, really low. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  And I start panicking.  Like, I'm looking for an engineer.  You got to turn his vocals up.  You got to turn his vocals up.  And then you hear the replay later, and it's perfect.  Like, these guys know what they're doing.  Who am I?  Of course.  Who am I to tell them?  And when Korn was singing, they had a guy with them, a really big dude.  He was kind of a tall guy.  He looked like Liam Neeson, but nothing like Liam Neeson.  And he was their manager, I think.  So I see him over at the MTV thing.  And I go, hey, man, I just saw you with Monkey and Jonathan over there. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.  That would have been nice.  It was, oh, okay.  What do you do?  I'm like, I'm on air with Opie and Anthony.  He was all cool.  Like, he just did, it went right over him.  Oh, no.  He must meet a lot of people on a daily basis.  I didn't get offended.  You're not as important.  Oh, he had Jared Leto there.  He had a few other bands and stuff.  He was working out.  But I was like, Jesus, dude.  How did you forget three minutes later?  You just saw the guy. 
[00:25:30]  Just.  How do you forget this awful face?  The same Sabbath shirt.  Only a couple hours later.  I know.  Well, the pictures from the corn visit are up on opiananthony.com.  And the video, it might make its way to YouTube.  You never know.  Of course it will.  YouTube taking over the world.  Taking over my life.  Everyone talking about it.  I love the YouTube.  Love it.  Every day I throw Opie and Anthony in the search and see what new videos have been added overnight.  And it's just cool because you just have to really look around to find videos. 
[00:26:00]  Does somebody say, hey, did you see this happen on the news?  Or, you know, there was a screw up on the news and the video is available somewhere.  I don't know where it is.  Now you just go to YouTube and everything that has happened that's funny to watch is up there.  I think we were going to get the guys from YouTube on the show.  I don't know what's happening with that.  Too big now?  Who knows?  Are there going to be a couple of those guys that just, hey, dude, let's start a website.  And then, like, a year later they sell it for a gazillion dollars?  They're one of the lucky ones.  Maybe they're refusing to do this show because they're saying they want to find a more kind of a demo-appropriate show to do. 
[00:26:30]  Kind of like the VMA said to the Opie and Anthony radio show.  Yeah, I mean, we're doing pretty well with our careers lately, but we still get slapped in the face.  We wanted to be at the VMAs.  We wanted to broadcast live.  We've done it in the past.  And we were denied.  We're on, like, 25 radio stations.  We're on XM across America and then XM Canada as well.  Sorry.  So distracted.  Yeah, what happened here?  Whenever you see a car chase end and just them beating the crap out of the driver, it's a lot of fun to watch. 
[00:27:00]  I don't know.  Apparently they threw down some spike strips.  It looked like L.A.  Usually is.  And then the car rammed into a Budweiser truck.  And they dragged the guy out and proceeded to tune him up.  Correct him.  He had to be corrected.  It's all about the video of the day.  See, we get distracted as soon as we see it.  Because these damn Panasonic plasma TVs, they're everywhere. 
[00:27:30]  They're all over.  They're everywhere.  And they're distracting us.  They're all over the studio.  Now they're saving some horse.  What happened to the little horsey?  Oh, no.  Anyway, so we wanted to broadcast live from the VMAs.  And we were shut out.  Shut down.  What happened?  We're on, like I said, 25 stations.  We're one of the top channels on XM.  It's XM Canada as well.  Why would they deny us?  And then I got an email saying they only had a limited amount of space, so they had to go with the radio stations that had the biggest audience in the demos they're looking for or something like that. 
[00:28:00]  I'm like, are you kidding me?  We reach more people than any other local show in New York.  Liar, liar, pants on fire.  Whoever's in charge of the media relations, whoever made that decision is a dope for MTV.  Why would you guys say no to that request?  Demo?  What are they talking about?  I don't know.  What the hell are they talking about?  We reach more people across America and Canada than any other radio show in New York, at least.  Give me a couple of shows that did go. 
[00:28:30]  That are going.  It was probably like Scott and Todd.  Ugh.  You know one?  Probably Elvis.  Yeah.  Elvis?  I don't know.  Z100?  Yeah.  Ugh.  Boy, you're going to get an exciting interview there.  They were prominently featured at the press thing.  They had a lot of radio and TV guys, and a lot of the radio stuff.  Yeah, a lot of that.  A lot of black stations around, like, you know, in Atlanta.  Oh, okay.  That's what they mean, then.  What?  Stupid.  How do we not figure that out?  With all the hip-hop that they play on MTV, we're too white. 
[00:29:00]  Well, the white culture has completely gone away as far as MTV goes.  We've given up.  Oh, we have.  We've given up that stronghold years ago.  Yeah, we certainly have.  We ran and said, take it.  It's yours.  All right.  Well, we were talking about this before the break in the New York Daily News.  We got another huge article.  David Hinckley.  Did the Post write about it?  Nah, nah.  The Post, they don't even, they want to make believe we don't even exist at this point. 
[00:29:30]  That's all right.  We'll still be fine with our careers.  The VMAs.  You're really getting to us by not writing about us, New York Post.  What can I tell you?  It hurts.  David Hinckley.  He's been a friend and a foe over the years.  When we first came back to New York, I think David Hinckley really hated us.  I think he was kind of an old school guy.  And we went to a radio station that was all about the music man.  The music man.  Then we came in and effed it all up.  And I don't think he was happy about that at first.  But then he's learned to like us. 
[00:30:00]  I think over the years.  A little bit.  A little bit.  And he's been very favorable lately.  Anyway, the article, the headline, Opie and Anthony sweat that first date with Dave.  Opie and Anthony, the morning team on Free FM and XM Satellite Radio are ordinarily the  most relaxed guys in the room sitting back and enjoying a good chuckle at whatever passes  there goes by.  Look at E-Rock's hair.  Mitch God has passed us. 
[00:30:30]  There it goes by.  But we chuckled at it.  And it was a good chuckle.  Relaxed.  Very relaxed.  Yes.  But this week they've been as nervous as soldiers waiting to find out whether they're being  assigned to ceremonial guard duty at Camp David or search missions in Baghdad.  Well, not quite that nervous.  If I was being told you're going to Baghdad as a, you know, a fighting soldier, I'd be 
[00:31:00]  crapping myself.  I'd be a little more nervous there, Mr. Hinckley.  He's actually written that about soldiers.  He said they're more nervous than Anthony and Tel Aviv.  Okay.  I think David.  That's a good one.  I think Mr. Hinckley was trying to make a joke there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think he was trying.  Because tonight.  Because tonight is their first appearance on The Late Show with David Letterman.  This came up.  Is that tonight?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I like to sound like I'm relaxed and didn't even know. 
[00:31:30]  Sorry.  I slept like a baby yesterday.  Did you sleep finally?  Did you?  Yeah.  I slept like a baby.  I crapped myself.  And I cried all night.  No.  Now that it's here, I'm psyched.  I think what the problem was was just waiting.  Yeah.  Because we found out about this about a month ago.  So it was kind of in the back of your head.  You know?  I mean, I still think I'm just this dopey kid from Long Island.  And, like, you know, I grew up watching Letterman.  Who didn't?  I sat in the audience many times. 
[00:32:00]  You actually went?  Oh, many times, yeah.  See, I never went.  I was there for one of those silly Bruce Willis things where he comes out like an action hero.  Really?  Out of nowhere.  And I actually was in the audience when Dave Chappelle did his first David Letterman appearance.  Ooh.  When he was just a kid.  Like, I don't know, in his early 20s, maybe?  He was still young, yeah.  Yeah.  So anyway, so of course we're going to be nervous.  Of course.  Was Chappelle funny?  Or did he bomb?  He was unbelievable.  Yeah? 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  Because I didn't know who he was at the time.  I'm like, man, this guy is funny.  And then he kind of, like, never, he didn't really go anywhere.  He was just kind of, you know, and then obviously exploded.  Everyone knows who Chappelle is.  But this is, like, this has to be, like, it has to be at least 10 years ago.  By the way, they replayed that goddamn Charlie Murphy, Rick James thing that could be one of the funniest things that has ever been on television.  Yeah.  I've seen it a couple of times, and it was on rerun the other night, and I watched the whole thing. 
[00:33:00]  It has got to be one of the funniest things ever put on television.  It's just Charlie Murphy really telling a story about Rick James that happened.  And I'm sure everyone's seen it and knows about it.  And it's acted out by Dave Chappelle and Charlie Murphy and everything.  And it's hysterical funny.  It actually became a, I'm Rick James, bitch.  I mean, it became, like, this really weird pop culture thing.  In no time.  And it became the thing everybody talked about. 
[00:33:30]  Chappelle's show was the thing everybody was talking about.  I'm trying to come up with a catchphrase for America.  Ooh.  Good luck with that.  How's that working for you?  Well, my.  What are you working on?  I'm a black ninja, mother effer.  Yeah.  Okay, a couple of people picked up on that.  On a message board.  Wait, what's wrong with Travis?  Did I screw it up?  He's thin.  What?  He's saying that you messed up your own catchphrase.  Oh, did I mess up my own catchphrase?  Maybe that's the problem. 
[00:34:00]  See, these guys know it, though.  All right, come here, Travis.  What is it?  Yeah, but I changed, but see, I can't, I changed.  That's a very pretty skirt you got on today.  Wow, that's new.  See, I know what you're going to say, but I have an excuse.  Go ahead.  What's the catchphrase?  I'm a black ninja, F-face.  F-face, right.  But I changed it for a project that's coming out soon.  A project?  But I did.  That's why I got confused.  Ah.  He had to because of copyright reasons, like Clayton Moore couldn't wear the Lone Ranger. 
[00:34:30]  Right.  He had to wear those big dopey glasses, the cataract glasses.  I changed it to, I'm a black ninja, mother effer.  Uh-huh.  That's the catchphrase that's going to take over America.  You watch.  I'm watching.  It's going to be in a big project.  Watching and waiting.  That we'll be talking about in another month or so.  I want a catchphrase.  Yeah.  What's your catchphrase?  Get a tumor, Hawk.  Oof.  No.  Ant, catchphrase?  I think that get a tumor might work if it's not, like, directed at Hawk directly. 
[00:35:00]  Just like, ah, get a tumor.  Like, everyone will be singing it around the water cooler.  Yeah, look on your brainstem, you goose.  No.  Like, around the, I'm just picturing the water cooler at work and that being thrown about.  No.  Ant, you got a catchphrase yet?  Yeah, but I can't say them.  I don't want the JDL coming after me.  I got a catchphrase.  I got a few catchphrases I use around the house, in my car, when the windows are rolled up and I'm alone being cut off by a savage. 
[00:35:30]  They're catchphrases that, and they're timeless.  Been used for years, centuries, some of them.  Hey, Nathaniel reminded me of my catchphrase.  I totally forgot.  Oh, what is it?  Frunkus!  He actually wrote that on a piece of paper?  How did he spell that?  How did he spell F-frunkus?  R-R-R-O-N-K-I-S, exclamation point.  Right, of course. 
[00:36:00]  Frunkus.  That's right.  Jimmy does have a catchphrase that he's hoping will catch on.  Good luck with that one, too.  We all want a catchphrase that just catches on.  Yeah.  Pop culture.  I'm going with the Black Ninja one.  That's got the best shot in this room, I think, is the Black Ninja.  Are you going with that one?  Yeah, but it's already been talked about.  You know, cabbies will say, frunkus, the point.  Bumper stickers are being printed as we speak.  Yeah, a bunch of arms.  Raps around the whole car with a lap.  Right.  Anyway, where were we in this thing here? 
[00:36:30]  Okay, this came up again yesterday when they ranted that their bosses at CBS Radio should  never have scheduled them to meet with an advertiser before the Letterman taping because  they don't need any distractions.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, to the bigwigs around here, it's no big deal that we're going to be on Letterman.  Giant wigs.  Because these same people we worked for, you know, worked with Howard Stern and Imus.  So to them, it's like, oh, yeah, a Letterman appearance.  No, but it's the first time for us.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:37:00]  Ramping, of course, is one of the things ONA do and one of the reasons they're so successful.  But it's also true the Letterman show is a genuine big deal.  See, David Hinkley's seen it our way.  It shows you've arrived, says Tom Taylor, editor of the radio trade sheet Inside Radio.  It raises you another rung on the ladder.  There's nothing wrong with being simply a successful radio host.  You could accumulate hundreds of thousands of adoring fans and millions of dollars.  Ooh. 
[00:37:30]  But going on Letterman is a big step toward becoming a national multimedia entertainment personality,  which means more fans and more cash.  It also means you must sell yourself all over again to Letterman and his audience,  Knocking him dead on 92.3 FM counts for nothing on TV, Taylor points out.  Yeah.  If you can't also sell yourself as entertaining or interesting in a visual medium,  just ask Howard Stern, who probably isn't the example Opie and Anthony like to invoke, 
[00:38:00]  but who nonetheless did this same dance several years ago.  We got to dance?  Stern decided to present himself on Letterman as a lunatic,  and his manic behavior worked well enough for Letterman to make him a semi-regular,  which in turn got Stern's name out to so many people who never would have listened to him on the radio.  I think the ratings help, too.  Nor do the benefits only flow in one direction here.  An appearance on Letterman gives Opie and Anthony validation that they've reached a higher level of pop culture acceptance, 
[00:38:30]  says Taylor, and ONA confers some hipness validation on Letterman with their core young male audience.  Tonight, then, is a first date, and scheduled accordingly because the last week in August is a relatively slow week for TV viewership.  Thanks.  That's good.  No one will be watching.  Let's book these idiots.  Right.  Great.  First date.  Are we supposed to kiss Dave on this one?  I have a feeling there are a lot of CBS bosses going, hey, come on, can you do me a favor? 
[00:39:00]  Throw us a bone.  Yeah, I know.  We work for the same company, so I'm thinking there's some kind of favor thing happening here.  But the VMAs won't affect you because they'll be over by the time you guys are on.  And there'll be a lot of people maybe staying up late tonight because of that.  Yeah, true.  Maybe they'll take a little peek.  Who knows?  Peeksy, as we say.  On the other hand, Thursday may be the single most important weeknight,  so it's not like ONA can work out their Letterman schtick in an empty room.  What?  It means there's going to be a lot of people watching us tonight. 
[00:39:30]  A few million people, many of whom know nothing about ONA,  will be watching to see if these two guys can entertain them fast and well.  Uh-oh.  Pressure?  What pressure?  Pressure.  Thank you.  Thank you, Dave.  Yeah.  He's written some nice articles about us lately, and we greatly appreciate it.  I like him.  He was nice to this show, and he was nice to Lucky Louie, that David Hinckley is a good boy.  No, we're psyched.  Good egg, Noonan.  I can't wait now.  Yeah.  I can't wait.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  I'm just going to enjoy the moment. 
[00:40:00]  Anthony's going to enjoy the moment.  Of course.  And I guess I was reading some fan sites, and it looks like we're going to get a little  support outside the theater tonight.  That's very nice.  That would be sweet.  I got cold, hard cash I'm going to just throw around tonight.  Is that what you're doing?  But of course, Mark Turnoff.  Sorry.  I distract everybody with the TV.  Why?  What's going on now?  It was some hack DJ.  Doing what?  That's going to the MTV VMAs with a big Z100 banner behind him. 
[00:40:30]  That's what they're doing.  We don't get to go.  Who is that?  Who is that?  Who is that?  E-Rock.  Well, why don't we get some audio?  Why don't we get some audio?  What gender does he sleep with?  Why don't we get some audio?  Because they picked that guy instead of our show.  He has to be terrific.  He's got to be great.  He has to be terrific.  So there's going to be a lot of fans showing up outside the theater tonight, right?  So we wanted to make it worth their while.  And I was like, look, what can we do for the fans? 
[00:41:00]  They're helping us out, helping us get an energy before we go into the theater.  So Mark said, do you want some cash or something?  I'm like, yeah, cash.  Cash always works.  Always works, especially with our listeners.  So I run them back and I go, yeah, my idea is give me like $1,000 or so.  And I'll just throw it at the fans that show up.  A cool G.  And of course he has to write back.  I don't know if that's a good idea.  People could get hurt. 
[00:41:30]  Or if you just throw money out?  Yeah, because the cash could cause a frenzy.  Money bags.  And this is what's great about having like two bosses these days.  Because Eric Logan got the same email and he's like, oh, that's a great idea.  That's awesome.  And then I wrote them back.  Throw knives too.  But I wrote them back and I go, but Mark thinks people will get hurt in a feeding frenzy as they're trying to pick up a couple bucks.  Yeah.  And Eric Logan's like, there's no way that's going to happen.  He's like, throw the cash. 
[00:42:00]  Throw the cash.  That would be funny.  That's XM's motto.  That would be a really funny thing to do.  Just throw cash at your fans inside and walk in.  Like a couple of jerks.  I know how pompous.  How asinine and pompous that is.  Thank you for showing up, little people.  Thank you.  Here's some crumbs.  Your troubles.  The problem is it's going to be a hundred ones.  Yeah.  They understand this show.  No one thinks 50s are being tossed out. 
[00:42:30]  I think a thousand bucks to throw would be great, though.  Yeah.  I think it's a quick, dumb idea, but then there has to be emails going back and forth about the cash and what kind of problem that will cause.  Every subject has like 50 emails attached to it.  I see the same subject 50 times.  I go to the last one, and then I can read all the way down.  That's it.  I know not to click on any of the ones below it.  Find the last one, see what everyone's bitching about, see what E-Rock's yelling about, cursing in his corporate emails. 
[00:43:00]  That's professional.  Yeah.  Then I had an observation because the whole VMA thing went back and forth yesterday.  There was about, I don't know, 10 or 12 emails about that.  We're trying to figure out why we can't be there broadcasting live, why we have none of the people that are going to be on the MTV Music Awards, you know, calling our show today.  That's right.  Video Music Awards, whatever.  We've been pretty much shut out. 
[00:43:30]  And E-Rock got involved and showed some passion for the Opie and Anthony show, which we enjoy.  Yes.  And Than, if you will.  He just had a short series of emails that all ended with, F them.  Yeah.  With the word fully spelt out.  That's right.  That's right.  Forget them.  Yeah, not solving the problem or trying to work around it.  Just pure emotion and anger.  Yeah, his advice was just, F them.  No solution.  Over and over again.  Diplomacy.  Just F them.  He was using my catchphrase. 
[00:44:00]  He was writing, frunkus them.  Frunkus them.  All right.  By the way, young Roland, speaking of booking people.  Yeah.  We saw the killers yesterday at the group of killers at this video thing.  You know, one of them said hello to me because, you know, we did let her together.  Oh.  And Roland wants them on the show playing, and he spoke to their manager, and he's working on trying to do that.  So young Roland is always at work.  That's nice.  I think Korn just knocked the door in as far as bands playing on our show.  I mean, you could talk to well over a million.  Talk to.  You could play in front of a million people. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  Well over a million people, actually.  And that's just in this room.  Let's say hi to Wizard the Trucker.  What's up, Wizard?  Nothing.  Morning, ladies.  I didn't listen.  It deserves a bomb.  It stunk.  Y'all hear me out there or what?  Yeah, go.  All you.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Hi.  Hey, I'm going to be like a preacher in the dang Southern Baptist Church.  Try really hard not to dump out.  I don't like Anthony there.  6-40, you had a GD.  Oh, boy.  Boring!  Oh, boy. 
[00:45:00]  Go ahead, buddy.  Get to your point, sir.  I'm trying really hard not to bust your balls.  You guys corrected it.  Y'all are replaying yesterday's stuff about that retarded Redding thing deal going on.  Retarded Redding.  But anyhow, you guys corrected all that.  I was going to bust your balls on it, but y'all straightened it out.  Anthony, I just got a communique from Steve from foundrymusic.com.  What does it say?  The Korn video is on Foundry mixed with show audio. 
[00:45:30]  Sounds good.  Oh.  And I'm sure the video will make its way to YouTube in the very near future.  Of course it will.  So if you want to see Korn performing live in studio yesterday, actually go to opiananthony.com.  It's the easiest way because you can spell opiananthony a lot easier than you can spell foundrymusic.com.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.

The ONA virus spreading across America.  Very, very busy morning, man. 
[00:46:30]  I just saw Otto and George.  They're in the green room.  Nice.  While Otto's in the green room with his puppet George.  Later on this morning, Tracy Morgan's calling in to say hi.  And Jason Statham is here.  Mm-hmm.  We're going to be talking to him in about a half hour.  He's here?  Jason?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He does, like, all kinds of weird stuff, right?  He's been in some great movies.  He's an action guy.  Okay.  Yeah.  And on the phone, Carlos Mencia, he wants to say hi. 
[00:47:00]  Carlos, what's up, buddy?  Oh, man, I was playing Laura Croft, and I realized it was like, hey, you guys are still up, so I'd give you guys a con.  Well, no, you're still up.  We slept and got up.  Exactly, man.  But, uh, hey, I'm a black ninja, mother effer.  Oh, it's catching on.  See, there you go.  I told you.  It's catching on.  Will it be part of a video game in the near future?  You don't like that.  So you guys thought I was just busting.  Oh.  I'm really going to try to make it a catchphrase. 
[00:47:30]  Ooh.  You know what?  Don't get me.  Dude, Laura Croft.  I mean, what's up?  Yeah, what year are you in?  What's up with the Laura Croft?  Well, you don't like Laura Croft, bro?  I played it back in the day.  Oh, the new one?  The Laura Croft Legend?  Oh, the new one.  Yeah, but they made her boobies smaller and everything.  Really?  I've got the 360, and she's hot.  I'm telling you right now, she's really hot in the 360 one.  I don't know if she looks the same in your version, but I'm telling you, the Xbox 360,  I'm like, you get different outfits, and there's like this one outfit where she's got like this 
[00:48:00]  tight black thing and this little, like, crop top.  She's hot, dude.  Hey, is there a video game?  I remember when, like, we first got our gateway computer, my mother kept trying to sell me on,  where in the world is Carmen Santiago?  That was the big game my mom thought was, like, a fun video game.  The awful Norton family computer.  Oh, yeah.  The Norton family computer.  Is that game still in existence or no?  Wow, I don't know.  Dude, Carmen Santiago isn't even the guy's real name. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah, it was Carmen Santiago, and you would,  you would get clues like, Carmen just bought a box of something with Krapugles,  and you'd have to figure out what country that's from to figure out where she's at.  Yeah, it was, like, educational.  Oh, yuck.  Yuck.  That was when you had to see prompt on the stupid computer.  Oh, what the hell?  That was the last computer you actually knew anything about?  That was a video, like, my mother wanted to get a computer for the house,  and she's like, oh, this will be great, and we'll love it.  And I remember I downloaded porn, and I didn't know how to hide it on the computer, 
[00:49:00]  so it just went into, like, downloads, and then, you know.  Like, the second you turn it on, it was just porn on the screen?  Yeah, a woman, a toilet, you know how it goes.  Just the worst porno, too.  Dude, you really murdered, man, at the Travel Environment Show.  Yeah, at the PNC.  Oh, man, guys, it was so much fun, man.  It was so cool.  I wish I could do every single one of them.  That was so sweet being on stage with all you guys.  It was great, man.  The fans were great, because three and a half hours into it, 
[00:49:30]  they're still laughing their balls off,  and then Carl's hits the stage and just destroys.  Yeah, but I was so scared that they were, like, tired that, like,  if you heard, man, I didn't shut up.  I didn't let anybody breathe.  I was like, I got to get to the next joke.  They're going to leave me.  I got to get to it.  I was like, man, my heart was racing.  I mean, it was crazy.  Yeah, it's scary to pause on those things.  For some reason, I mean, when you're on stage and performing,  like, you're afraid, like, all right,  if I pause for a couple of seconds,  they're all going to recognize they're not enjoying this  and leave immediately.  It's like a really weird fear you get 
[00:50:00]  when you're trying to, like, just rapid-fly,  but, you know, you really just smashed them.  I paused at one point, and I got to hear,  up yours, buddy.  Like, great.  Yeah, don't pause.  Don't pause.  Give those animals an in.  Yeah.  Well, with regards to these catchphrases,  be careful, man,  because when they start repeating them all the time...  Oh, yeah.  Dude, I'm not kidding you, man.  I swear to God, I was at the airport,  and there's a group of special ed kids,  and two of them, like, caught my attention, 
[00:50:30]  and they started walking toward me,  and I swear to God, man,  one of them looked at me, and I couldn't tell.  He was, like, mentally retarded,  and I really couldn't tell  whether he was, like, pissed off or what.  And he looks at me, and he's like,  are you Carlos Mencia?  And I was like, oh, my God,  this is not happening to me.  And I'm like, yes.  And the other kid looks at me,  and he goes,  did-de-dee!  I swear to God.  What is did-de-dee?  Well, did-de-dee means, like, you're stupid.  Like, if, you know,  that's my catchphrase. 
[00:51:00]  From Mind of Mencia.  Yeah, like, I go did-de-dee,  and people all over the place  are coming up to me.  Now I'm going did-de-dee,  and it was like an actual,  like, mentally retarded kid did it to me.  There's only one person in this studio right now  that knows that I, Opie,  indeed came up with a catchphrase  that caught on on Long Island.  Really?  Yeah, when I was doing my little radio show out there.  So what was it?  A boo-boo-boo.  Oh, the a boo-boo-boo. 
[00:51:30]  If we ever play the first show  Anthony and I did together...  I have that, by the way.  We have the first show  that Ant and I did together.  All right, Carlos.  There are so many douche-chill moments.  Even though the talent was there  and the chemistry was there,  we have tried to play the first show  Ant and I have done together  many, many times.  I think we've gotten maybe two minutes into it. 
[00:52:00]  It's like a 20-minute tape,  and Ant and I look at each other like,  oh, my God, just come up with an excuse  why we have to move on to something else.  Ant was just so happy to be there.  One of these days...  I was laughing at everything,  overselling everything.  Yeah, overselling everything  because I was just happy to be there.  One of these days, we'll do it.  We'll do it upright.  We'll officially do like a roast.  This will be our roast  where we'll just play the tape  and let the boys just comment on it, 
[00:52:30]  you know, like Patrice O'Neill  and Colin Quinn  and Carlos, if you're in town,  you're more than welcome.  Please call me, dude.  I'll fly over there for that.  But when you said that people come up to you  and do the catchphrase,  there was a time on Long Island,  I had a pretty successful night show,  and I would have to do all the bars and stuff,  all those gigs,  and these guys would come up to me  right in my face and go,  boop, boop, boop.  It started out as a dumb thing.  I took a lot of phone calls  on my radio show back in the day, 
[00:53:00]  and I would do like kind of a  see ya, you know, kind of thing  at the end of every call,  and then I would say something like  see ya, bro, but really fast,  and then it just kind of morphed  into this really ridiculous thing  that gives me douche chills  just talking about it,  and it's on a lot of my old shows,  and people will come up to me  in the bars and do it to my face.  Wait, what was it?  You would say a zero,  like it was just like a zero,  like that?  Yeah.  A zero?  It just started morphing into, 
[00:53:30]  and then I just started making noises  at the end of their phone calls.  A boo, boo, boo.  And then it turned out to be  a boo, boo, boo.  But it was said like how?  I can't do it.  No, but I mean,  how would you say it?  Like a boo, boo, boo.  Like that?  Like a boo, boo, boo.  Come on, no.  For old time's sake.  Oh, man.  Could you all boo, boo, boo,  because they're all going to laugh at me.  No, I'll be all here.  I have it on the table.  They'll all laugh at you.  All right, I'll close my eyes.  All right, close your eyes.  Don't look at anyone.  Go ahead.  Just put yourself back there.  It's 1993. 
[00:54:00]  Boo, boo, boo.  Boo, boo, boo.  All right, now.  What was the worst butchering of that  that anybody did?  Because see,  like how simple is  that's so simple?  Yeah.  But like they butcher it.  Like, you know,  I'll go somewhere and say,  hey, Carlos,  that's not even close, dude. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, well,  I was like,  oh, my God,  this thing caught on.  I was so embarrassed.  And then people would-  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  I'd be at these bar gigs,  you know,  handing out dumb bumper stickers  and stupid T-shirts  and, you know,  maybe a free pass  to go skiing.  Wow.  That was the big prize.  And then I'd be on stage  and some ass drunk  would come up.  Come on, do it.  Do it.  Come on, do it.  I'm sure they won't be  doing it tonight  outside of Letterman.  I'll say, 
[00:55:00]  Carlos,  to answer your question,  the worst butchering  anyone ever did  if that was to get it accurately.  I really couldn't  give it my all there  because I'm beyond embarrassed  by that.  I would never do that.  Part of my radio career.  Well.  But, Carlos,  you killed at the  PNC Arts Center.  Lawn Seats,  you're not going to join us  at the Tweeter Center  in Camden, unfortunately.  I mean,  you're too big.  You're too big.  You were able to do  one of them.  No, that's not it.  You guys did this tour 
[00:55:30]  like after I had already  booked this Punisher tour.  So, like,  I just,  I couldn't do  most of the stuff.  Like, I did one  because I could,  but it wasn't because  I didn't want to.  It was only because  I had already booked  all this stuff ahead of time.  Well, we got 10 comedians  for the Camden Show  in Philly,  and Lawn Seats  are going for $10  right now  through Labor Day.  It's a great deal.  Keep listening to WYSB  if you're listening to us  in Philly,  or go to opiananthony.com  for all the details.  But the headline,  $10 Lawn Seats 
[00:56:00]  for 10 comedians.  What do you do in the,  when are you coming  to Atlantic City?  I'm flying in there  on Saturday.  I'm going to do  two shows on Sunday night,  and then I'm out of there  I think on Monday.  Okay.  Are there seats available  for either one of those?  You know what?  I don't know.  Singles, maybe.  Okay.  If any of you guys  want to come and hang out,  I got rooms for you,  so just let me know.  Yeah, I got your phone call yesterday.  I might take you up  on that, actually.  Yeah, let me know.  Just give me a call.  But listen, guys.  I was going to hit the beach 
[00:56:30]  because it's Labor Day weekend,  and it's like winter out there.  Like, they're talking about  how everyone's going  to the beaches  in the New York area  with, like, you know,  with winter clothes.  Yeah, it's cold.  And it's going to be rainy  all weekend,  thanks to Ernesto.  Yeah.  Yeah, why'd they have to  name it after a beaner, man?  That's not even cool.  They don't have enough.  There's not that many  Spanish hurricane names, though.  They're very diverse now.  Hugo did a lot of damage.  Like, hey, Katrina.  Oh, and by the way,  they're very diverse. 
[00:57:00]  That's the politically  correct crap.  They want to soften  the names of these hurricanes  so they're not as scary.  Yeah, so name it Ernesto.  But for the record,  I think I talked about it  on your show  about if Survivor had,  it would be better  if they had a wetback  that just crossed the border  and a black guy  and a redneck.  Yeah.  And now they're doing Survivor  with all these  different races, dude.  Oh, yeah.  They stole my idea  that I said on your show.  And stupid GM 
[00:57:30]  yanked their advertising  from CBS  because of that.  These dummies.  Yeah, they, they, they,  they, they...  Bunch of cowards.  They were feeling the pressure  and they bailed.  Because John Liu,  the Democrat here in New York  who's Asian,  who's obsessed  with his Asian-ness.  Right.  You can't...  For five seconds,  this guy is obsessed  with being Asian  and he's complaining  because they're doing  an ethnic thing  and it's stereotypical.  It's like, dude,  your whole career  is built on being Asian.  You know, General Motors  makes fine products.  I know they do.  I just don't like this.  And I have no problem 
[00:58:00]  with them pulling anything  if they truly believe  that that is not the...  What am I saying?  Listen to me.  You're talking to Caddy Jimmy.  I love GM.  For the products,  whoever's in charge  of that advertising decision  is a dope.  Ah, good point, Jim.  Good point.  They never should have yanked me.  Trunkus to you.  Trunkus.  Why would you yank  the advertising  for such a great product  over somebody small?  It just sucks  these special interest groups  are out there.  And they felt the pressure  from the special interest groups.  I bet you they would love 
[00:58:30]  to continue advertising  with Survivor.  Well, John Lue threatened him.  He goes,  if you don't...  Yeah, great.  John Lue is going to come  after us eventually.  You know that.  We're going to say  some dumb chink joke  and he's going to be  all over the news  about how bad  Opie and Anthony are.  I know.  You've got to ignore...  I guarantee it's coming.  ...the special interest groups.  Businesses have to ignore them  because they don't have  the power they think they do.  They scare people  into doing  what they want them to do,  but they don't have 
[00:59:00]  the actual  the oomph  to back up  their threats  of boycotts.  No one wants to boycott  General Motors.  If you want to buy  an Escalade,  you're going to buy  a goddamn Escalade.  Not according to John Lue.  He said,  if you don't yank this,  I'll make sure  no one buys cataracts.  Okay.  No, man.  I ain't going to buy  no Escalade, man,  because I can't believe  they put a black man  on a survivor like that.  Yeah.  I used to make me look like that  and then expect me  to buy an Escalade,  and I ain't getting  no spinners either,  all right?  I'm just saying that right now. 
[00:59:30]  People will buy  whatever they want to buy,  and it doesn't matter  who says boycott.  Well, boycotts don't work.  They don't work.  You can't get enough people  behind it,  especially if it's something  ridiculous like this.  If it's something  really huge  that a lot of people  are behind,  and I can't even think  of an example  because most people  are self-centered asses anyway,  and someone orders  a boycott,  people are going to go,  yeah, I really kind of  like that product.  But if it's something  that's really vicious,  but this is just something 
[01:00:00]  that's politically incorrect,  no one is going to support  a boycott of something  because of its  political incorrectness.  But we don't even know.  This is what bothers me.  We're trying to get  Mark Burnett on the phone.  No one has even seen  the first episode.  Yep.  There you go.  And there's all this outrage.  John Lewis.  Maybe it's handled  in such a way  where people are going to go,  oh, what was the big deal?  This is, all right,  this is kind of cool, actually.  But they're all members  of these special interest groups  that are obsessed  with their own ethnicity.  Like, I'm a member  of the Asian group.  The Asian.  Oh, fine.  They're more separatist 
[01:00:30]  than any,  which is more offensive  and politically incorrect  than anything  that they boycott  or protest against.  They're obsessed  with their ethnicity.  Yeah.  They're obsessed.  They're separatists.  They're complete separatists.  I think it makes  for a great season  of survival.  I think it should be  balls out to racial epithets.  Absolutely.  Because we're all  going to root for our own.  That's going to be more exciting  than the stupid Olympics  they shove down our throat  every four years. 
[01:01:00]  That's the good part about it,  that races are going  to be involved now,  that, you know,  the black people  are going to be going  for the black guy  and the beaners  are going to be going,  oh, my God,  I can't believe General Motors.  I love my Chevy.  And they're going to be  pissed off about that.  It's beautiful.  And then what do they got?  Asians, black guys.  Well, it is surviving.  They do a lot of water activities.  So, I mean, the blacks,  I mean, you know.  It was in the paper.  Finished black people.  It was in the paper yesterday.  The blacks are finished.  The Hispanics are going to win  all the water events.  That black people  have more drownings. 
[01:01:30]  It was right.  It was in the paper.  Here it is.  Swim lessons.  Minority youths are being taught  life-saving water skills.  Blacks at highest risk  of drowning.  This is in the paper  and they got statistics  that back this crap up.  How could you argue it?  So then when a stereotype  comes along  and somebody says something like,  well, you know,  a lot of black people  have trouble swimming.  And then people pile on. 
[01:02:00]  You get black people,  black leaders saying  this is racist,  blah, blah, blah,  this, that, that.  But it's in the paper.  They have statistics.  So, yeah, you're right.  I think the Survivor thing,  they're screwed  as far as the water events go.  Yeah, well,  I hope it's not on an island  and they don't have a Cuban  because that guy's going to disappear  and end up in Miami  and about a day.  Yeah, see?  I think the Hispanics  would do very well  in the swimming.  And then, you know,  the Asians will eat anything,  so they're going to win  all the eating competitions.  They're going to win  all the eating competitions. 
[01:02:30]  And when it comes  to the brute strength challenges,  the black guys got it knocked.  That's right.  Because, like,  what's his name said?  Who was that?  Shecky Green?  You know,  the blacks had the extra muscle  in the leg.  No, no, that was  Jimmy the Greek.  Jimmy the Greek.  Well, Shecky Green  said it once in joke form.  Oh, really?  No.  I just said  I have to get myself  out of a jam.  You're talking about  Don Rickles.  Don Rickles.  Hey, that's the black guy  in the front  with extra muscle.  Well.  Well, what event  are the white guys  going to win then?  Probably computers. 
[01:03:00]  Um.  Showing up for work.  Yeah.  And we have  the banking competition.  Well, if it's showing up  for work  and they have a Mexican,  he's going to be there  extra early, bro.  Um.  Yeah, that's true.  The white team  is going to take  a pickup truck  to the Mexican team  and pick them up  to do the challenges.  And take them  to the event.  That's what he says.  Pick them up  for the challenges.  Could you do these  for us, please?  Yeah.  We'll pay you.  Cheap.  The Mexicans  are going to be  in their camp 
[01:03:30]  going.  We've been waiting  for the truck,  but nobody came.  Where are we supposed  to be?  And all the articles  I read about this,  they're pretty much  saying CBS  is losing their minds.  You know they did  in such a way  that they know  it's acceptable,  of course.  I know this much.  I did this thing  on the show  called the Stereotype  Olympics  where we actually  just had  five different races  compete  in five different  ethnic stereotypes.  So we had like  a watermelon eating  contest  and we had 
[01:04:00]  a fence jumping  contest  and not only  was it the highest  rated episode,  but I get like  it's on YouTube.  It's one of the  biggest downloaded.  People love  that stuff.  It's just honest.  It's, you know,  I don't know why  people get so  pissed off at it.  It's just the way  things are.  It's hilarious.  Yeah, people don't  like to acknowledge  stereotypes unless,  again, the stereotype  somehow helps their  own special interest.  It's just so annoying.  I'm so tired of it.  John Liu makes me sick. 
[01:04:30]  You think John Liu  gets pissed off  when people say,  you know something,  the Asians have  a great love of family  and a great work ethic.  Yeah, the Asians  have contributed  a lot to this country  and typically  will always help  other Asians  because they're  very, very  a close-knit community.  Yeah.  Hey, hey, hey,  there are some  real scumbags  in the Asian community  too, you know.  You don't hear that.  It's like your  little faggoty parades  and I mean this  forever, the Dominicans, 
[01:05:00]  the Colombians,  the Jews, the Irish,  all your parades stink.  That's the only time  people will accept  the stereotype  is if we can get  together and obsess  over the accomplishments  of other people  of the same ethnicity.  And here in New York  they have parades  for every nationality.  I mean, you know,  you'll be stuck  in traffic for hours  and you'll find out  because it's for a parade  for a nationality  you've never even heard of.  Don't even know it.  It's gotten to that point.  Don't even know it.  They're way deep  with these parades.  You look down,  you finally get to the street,  they finally open it up  for you for two seconds 
[01:05:30]  so you can go through.  You look down the street,  you see people  like wearing gold lame  and riding elephants  and it's like  what nationality is this?  What are we celebrating today?  What the hell?  Just let me get out of town.  All right.  Well, Carlos,  Brigada,  I might see you down there.  Oh, well, come by.  Hey, guys,  what I called for  was to say  good luck tonight, man.  I know you guys will kill.  I know you'll take  to the next level.  Great, great, great,  great to be part  of the show, man.  Thanks.  All right, Carlos,  get back to the tomb raider. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah, I'm going to get  naked right now  because she's hot, dude.  I don't care what you say.  I just picture him  like Scarface  sitting in a tub  in the middle  of a big marble room  playing the game.  I've been to Carlos' house.  Have you found furniture  to fill up that place yet?  You know what?  Yeah, I have.  They just did cribs here.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  Really?  I remember seeing  part of that, sure.  We talk about this.  Carlos' house is so big.  I mean, he's got furniture,  but it's like  you can't fill up this place. 
[01:06:30]  That living room  slash kitchen  slash tennis court you got?  It's not full, dude.  Don't kid yourself.  He's got the biggest  flat screen ever  and it looks so tiny  on the wall  because the room is massive.  It's too big.  Yeah, you can play tennis  between the living room area  and the kitchen area  and it's all one room.  Fly pelican.  Yeah, right?  All right, Carlos.  Love you guys.  See you, buddy.  Later, man.  All right.  Carlos, see you, everyone.  Let's say hi to Doug Out Doug  before we take a break 
[01:07:00]  and get Otto and George in here.  Oh, Otto, that's right.  Doug Out.  What's up, guys?  Hi, young angel.  What's up?  Hey, as usual,  since you guys are going to be  somewhere in public today,  there's going to be  a drove of fans gathering  for the Letterman appearance.  Ah.  We've got a guy  bringing 8,000 Twinkies  in a truck from Maine  as an appetizer  for you guys' events.  Really?  Why Twinkies, though?  Why Twinkies?  Have you seen the fan base?  That's true.  They're trying to eat healthier.  They're on a diet. 
[01:07:30]  That's pretty smart.  And for anybody  that doesn't get into the show,  three of our lovely  Pal Talk ladies,  the Baby Girl,  XOXO,  and Happy Typing Girl,  will be leading  a march to the bar,  and I believe  there's rumors  of free body shots  for everybody  that shows up.  Oh, really?  Wow.  What's this about?  So everybody,  check one of your message boards,  the WhackBag.com,  the OAExperience.com.  There's information  on all of this  on the websites. 
[01:08:00]  And real quick,  if you're on the websites,  can you check out  and do a search  for FHM  because our Cara  from MySpace  is in one of the  top 100 girls  for the FHM  Digital Darlings  contest.  Oh, nice.  Oh.  Good for Cara.  That out.  Beautiful.  Yeah.  And don't forget, guys,  good luck tonight,  and anybody  you've ever car crashed  won't be watching  the show begging  for one of you  to screw up.  Of course.  You know,  there's going to be  a moment there  where we bomb 
[01:08:30]  on something.  Ta-da.  Right.  That's all.  All right, Doug.  Thank you.  Thank you for the support.  Thanks for everyone  that's going to show up  outside the theater  to give us  a little energy today.  All right, boys.  See you, Doug.  Later, Doug.  All right.  Him and that hot chick.  Oh, is his girlfriend sexy?  Eliza from Newark.  Yeah.  Oh, and hey.  How you doing, guys?  Eliza.  Hey, listen.  Eliza.  What the hell happened?  Eliza.  All of a sudden,  I hear Eliza  and I just think  Eliza Dushku  conjures up in my mind  and I'm waiting  for a female voice 
[01:09:00]  and I hear Mac.  You know how many  gay guys were getting  excited because we were  going to talk to  someone named Eliza  and it's you?  It's Elijah.  Is it Elijah?  It's Elijah.  Okay.  That's our dumb screener.  Yeah.  Can we handle this now?  Yeah, all right.  You guys all pissed off.  All right.  Time is money.  Hey, that's right.  Hey, John Lewis  is full of jokes.  I'm a black guy.  All right.  Every show,  I root for the black guy.  See?  I don't go to the movies,  horror movies, 
[01:09:30]  because the black guy  is going to die  in the first five seconds.  I'm not going to spend  my money for that.  Because you love who you are,  it doesn't mean  you're anti-somebody else.  You must hate cops, right?  Oh, no.  That's one of my favorite shows.  A lot of my friends  are on that.  There you go.  Newark.  Yeah, so let's just,  again, once again,  John Lewis just doing  what he does,  which is obsessing over  something that's just  going to get his thumb.  He was playing his radio  back very loudly.  He wanted to hear himself  on the radio,  so he had to dispatch him.  He was good. 
[01:10:00]  You know, just once again,  just piping up about  something completely  unimportant.  All the people that  consider themselves  leaders of ethnic groups  are separatists.  They're nothing but  separatists,  which is the most  politically incorrect  and offensive thing  you could be.  They want to be separate  from society.  They don't want  everybody mixing in.  They don't want to get  respect for their people  through assimilation  and just respect  through acting  like people should act 
[01:10:30]  in this country.  They get it through  separatism and through  calling people out  almost like a McCarthyism.  If you say something,  that's politically  incorrect,  then all of a sudden  you're the bad guy.  No one should pay  any attention to these  people or pull things  off the air or think  these boycotts are  going to work.  Get out of here.  Councilmen in general,  if you're a councilman,  probably you're an ass.  I'm a councilman! 
[01:11:00]  Are you?  I like that.  Councilmen.  They're just asses.  Trying to work their way  up the political ladder.  You mayor wannabes.  Start as a councilperson.  I'm a councilperson!  Can't you just run for that  like anyone can?  Of course you can!  I nominate the tampon  to be a councilperson.  You do.  You just gotta like find  some place,  some district.  Is it a district?  What do they run?  No, you need a lawn 
[01:11:30]  to put a sign on.  If somebody will  lend you their lawn  and you can put  your dumb name on it,  you can run  for councilperson!  And then what are  their duties?  I don't even know  what they do.  They represent like  a block.  Yeah, pretty much.  And then they have  to pass it on  to the next guy  that runs like  the district.  That's right.  And then the guy  that runs  the township  and then the guy  so they're really  at the bottom  of the whole heap.  The political heap.  Yeah, they really 
[01:12:00]  are at the bottom  of the pile.  The little hard  solid white ones  on the lawn  as opposed to  the heaping  new hot ones  on top.  The ones that knock  on your door.  Hi, I'd like  to introduce myself.  I'm your councilman.  Yes.  Are you?  Yeah, I'm running  for councilman.  I promised.  What are you gonna change?  Take my garbage  down to the curb.  Okey-doke.  Let me roll up  my shirt sleeves  like a working guy.  You're right.  They do stink.  How do you not  hate councilmen?  God almighty,  I challenge you 
[01:12:30]  to not vomit  at the thought  of a councilman.  I challenge you  That's right.  to listen to the drivel  from this councilman.  Tempestuously self-righteous.  Smooth life.  Asian body.  Hairless.  Hairless.  Where it counts.  Ponderous political wannabe.  Oh, they're awful.  All right, we gotta  take a break.  We're real late now.  Cattlemen stink. 
[01:13:00]  With that,  it's the ONA virus.  This is not what  I'm used to.  Here it is, live.  It's the O.P.  and Anthony Show.  Nothing but  foul language  and toilet humor.  For the new listeners  who think that  we've learned our lesson,  uh-uh.  Here's a short list  of the things  they've been saying.  Poopy.  Malarkey.  Tiny.  Let me coolly.  Let me titter.  I get it.  Someone pinch me.  Whoop-a-dee-doo.  K-sirah-sirah. 
[01:13:30]  Mumbo-jumbo.  Good nature  joshing around.  Puppy cock.  Poopy jokes.  Silly.  Humming up, humming up, humming up.  We just chit-chat  and go nuts.  What do you think  of them apples?  It's lame.  It's not even fun  to listen to, you know?  I don't know  how they could  screw up  something that simple.  Oh!  But boy,  they sure did.  Opie and Anthony!  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Here we go!  Here we go! 
[01:14:00]  Man, it's a busy morning.  A lot of distractions.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus  spreading across America.  Jimmy's heading  to the airport  in like an hour,  hour and a half  playing the improv  in Addison  for all you Dallas folks.  Had a great club down there.  Yeah, I love the improv.  I'm doing Pugs and Kelly tomorrow.  The greatest of it. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, very, very cool.  Tell him I said hi.  I just had Pugs and Kelly.  Those dudes.  Those dudes?  All chicks except Pugs.  Sag it again.  We're distracted  because we got  a Letterman thing  to do today.  Don't be nervous about that.  He's an L.A. comic.  He sucks it.  You guys...  Fine, don't worry.  Really, don't worry about that.  And I guess we got  to say hi to Otto.  Right.  And of course,  George, his puppet.  You guys are huge.  Don't worry about that at all.  You shouldn't be nervous. 
[01:15:00]  Are you nervous,  Anthony, at all?  You know what it is with me?  I get nervous  right up until I'm there.  Yeah.  Like, it's all  before crap that goes on.  And then, you know,  you get there,  you sit down,  you start doing  whatever you're doing.  Yeah.  Or get out on stage  if you're doing that.  And then everything's fine.  And then, you know,  you get done.  You're like,  oh, no big deal.  Like, when I saw  The Grateful Dead  on Letterman,  he kind of let Bob Weir  do the interview  and Garcia was just,  you know,  kind of laid back.  Are you going to let 
[01:15:30]  Opie do most of the...  No.  Yeah, I'll let him  do all the talking.  Yeah, that's what I would do.  I'm going to sit back  and just enjoy.  Yeah.  Just sit back.  Don't say anything.  Nah.  Just go,  I'm just going to let this  soak in  and you just chat.  Yeah.  We'll put each other  on the spot.  Hey, tell me that joke  you were telling me  about the time  you went down there.  Yeah, what was that thing?  Opie had a funny story  just in the green room.  Why don't you tell that one, Opie?  I didn't have a story.  Yeah.  Nah, we'll be fine.  It's just getting out there 
[01:16:00]  and doing it now.  It's great.  Yeah.  It's just been the build up  and waiting  and the phone calls  going back and forth  and stuff like that.  It'd be funny  if you guys just did  the hackiest,  like, back and forth,  like the obviously  most pre-planned back.  But, uh...  I know there's so many things  that would make  great inside jokes  but would come across  looking so bad.  Yeah, fans would go nuts though.  Yeah.  I think it's going to be  ONA 101 stuff  so it's going to be easy.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's going to ask  the basic stuff.  Sort of a get-to-know-ya  kind of thing. 
[01:16:30]  And then hopefully  we'll get a few laughs out  and then it'll be like,  alright, see you later.  Yeah, like the hardcore fans  are going to probably be like,  oh my god,  we've heard this stuff.  We've heard this stuff in my life.  Oh, you've been fired,  you did this,  you did the voyeur bus thing,  you know.  Well, because we're talking  to a whole new audience tonight.  Yeah.  So it's not about you, douchebags.  I think it's going to be  the stuff we've talked about  a million times,  the Sex for Sam,  the voyeur bus.  He's got to read  your, like, police record  and police...  Yeah, the police blotter.  He's going to, like,  run through that.  We've had, like, 
[01:17:00]  20 people arrested  for this radio show,  so, yeah.  He can talk about that.  Prime wave.  But enough about us.  Otto,  we said it on Monday.  You killed  at the PNC Arts Center show.  Look, I mean,  thanks for the opportunity,  you know.  When I'm on this show,  I feel so comfortable  with you guys,  but, you know,  then when you see  that audience  and realize how huge  you guys are,  and, I mean,  they weren't there  to see me,  but, you know,  I held my own.  It was great.  You murdered you.  You murdered.  Thank you.  We were all backstage  losing our,  you know what?  Yeah.  We were just losing it.  Watching it on the monitor 
[01:17:30]  and the, yeah,  the crowd going crazy.  You were beating up  the people sitting  on the lawn.  That made Jimmy and I  laugh so hard, man.  It's raining on them.  These poor guys,  yeah,  they got in late  as far as getting tickets,  so they're sitting  on the lawn,  and it was like  a misty rain all night.  Yeah.  Nothing too bad.  We were able  to get the show in,  and then when it was  time to go home,  that's when the rain  really hit.  Yeah.  But these guys  had ponchos on  and the grass was wet,  so they started sitting  kind of up on the hill,  and everybody was  slowly sliding 
[01:18:00]  toward the shell.  So they're miserable  to begin with,  although they had  a really good time,  and you're just  beating the hell out of them  from the stage.  They can still hear  and see up there, right?  Oh, yeah.  Huge screens and everything.  God.  Speaking of lawn seats,  it's the Tweeter Center show  for all the Philly people.  September 9th.  $10 tickets  through Labor Day.  Until Labor Day.  That's going to sell  a tremendous amount  of tickets,  and it's a great show,  and you're doing  Cleveland with us,  aren't we?  I haven't been  officially offered yet,  but yeah.  I hope so, man.  Pete Peter mentioned  me he wants to get  you for Cleveland,  so.  Yeah, I'd love to.  Maybe I'll drive down 
[01:18:30]  if I can't get a ticket.  Oh, that Cleveland's  a fun town.  We'll have a ball,  we'll go out,  we'll have a steak,  we'll get a bunch  of black people  and two white people.  You know what's fun  about all the stuff  that happened before  the show,  like meeting Club Soda,  Ken's kids.  He pulled up  in a golf cart  and this guy  yelled at him.  I guess he was  some important guy  at the PNC,  was like,  you can't use  that golf cart,  that's my golf cart,  you gotta,  and just to see  Ken, you know,  handle it like,  I'm sorry, sir,  you know,  being respectful. 
[01:19:00]  I wanted to see him  snap that guy's head off.  I know,  he does get  very respectful  to people  when you think  he just is gonna  punch him in the face.  He's a true professional.  I wanted to see  Buford Pusser  come at him.  Spinning back kick.  That's the quiet  before he just  attacks you,  is the courtesy,  the overly courteous  six foot five  lumbering ox  where diplomacy  is just barely  keeping your teeth  intact.  Otto,  part of your set  is up on YouTube. 
[01:19:30]  Is it?  Getting downloaded  like crazy.  Oh yeah,  is that good?  Yeah,  it's great.  That's good.  You want to be  part of the YouTube  phenomenon.  Oh,  okay.  Yeah,  absolutely.  So who's that  English guy  that's coming in here?  He's in a movie  or something?  Yeah,  we gotta get him in.  He's been in a few movies.  Supposedly he's supposed  to do some crazy stunt  for us.  He's English,  I'm so glad.  Do you want to have  like a Red Bull  drinking contest?  Did he?  Yeah.  Yeah,  he was the star  of one of my  favorite movies  of all time.  Which one?  Doesn't get the  recognition it deserves,  Snatch.  Oh,  okay.  Oh yeah.  Have you seen Snatch?  Oh no, 
[01:20:00]  I haven't.  Oh,  Snatch is just  an amazing film.  Wow.  He's Jason Statham.  Wow.  He's in Crank.  In theater September 1st  so it starts Friday.  We're gonna talk to him  in a few minutes  really fast.  Let's say hi to Leslie.  Leslie.  Hey,  what's up?  Hey Leslie.  I love you guys.  Let me tell you,  Saturday was awesome.  I had the best time  and Jim Norton  came out  because security guards  wouldn't let us in  and he came out  in the crowd  and signed  everybody's stuff.  He signed my boobs 
[01:20:30]  and Opie,  you are so hot.  Let me tell you something.  You are so hot.  Well,  Opie.  You must have seen Opie.  The thing Opie do  is he'll point over his head  and his shirt lifts  and you see that little V he has.  How do you not melt?  Thank you,  Leslie.  You guys were awesome,  really.  It was great.  He came out,  everybody came out  in the crowd  and I like those  stuck up people  that we see all the time.  You guys were right there  with us.  We all went out to sign.  I think Saget didn't  because he had his kids with him.  I think that's the only reason  he left  because I believe  he was with his kids.  But he's doing the Philly show? 
[01:21:00]  Yeah,  he's doing Philly  and Otto was there.  We were there.  And it was you and Anthony.  That's who they wanted.  They were like,  could you get Jim to sign us?  And Patrice?  Yeah.  No,  Anthony was there signing  and it didn't be very accessible.  Usually it's who they don't think  they can get  who they want the most.  I've never wanted to start a riot  so badly as I did  at the awful merch people  that work at the PNC.  Why?  They made us stand in the rain  inside while those two ugly women  just stood there  and hawked shirts.  Oh.  It's like the unions  won't let you back.  We're not going to touch the merch.  You know, it's ours.  Let us under the tent.  But no, you can't. 
[01:21:30]  No, you got to stay out here.  I don't know what that's about.  I'll tell you what it's about.  It happens at every venue too.  It's like,  we're not going to steal  your stupid shirts.  Why can't Clear Channel  who owns these things  just sell their own merch?  Yeah.  Why do you have to have them do it?  Who's that little English guy  that sells shirts for you?  Oh, Paul.  With his awful hairdo?  Yeah.  Good though.  Him and his wife are good.  Yeah, they seem very honest.  They are honest.  That's why I like them.  Yeah, they love you.  Definitely.  Yeah, he's honestly an ass.  Oh, his head.  He's a shrunken head.  Yeah, he does.  No filter Paul has a head  that belongs on somebody 
[01:22:00]  who's two feet, eight inches tall.  He has a teeny, tiny head.  Yeah.  He would make a great immunity idol  on Survivor.  I love you, Opie.  Oh, wow.  Thank you, Leslie.  Oh, she's still on the phone.  You're really so hot.  I'm not even joking.  You are so hot.  Let's get into this a little bit.  How hot?  You're really hot.  I'm not joking.  You signed my tits for me.  It was awesome.  I got a picture of everything.  All right, hold on.  So Opie signed your breasts?  Yes, he signed them for me. 
[01:22:30]  And he's so hot.  I'm not even joking.  Man, I don't know how to hang up on her.  Wow, she...  I'm having a hard time hanging up on her.  You don't have to hang up on me.  I got to go to work anyway.  So I just love you guys very much.  Like this.  What?  Or like...  Hey, no, no, hang up on her.  Like...  No.  Let me see.  How did you get...  Like that.  No, how did you get control of that?  Like that.  What are you doing?  There you go.  What happened?  Is she still there?  Hi, how are you?  Good.  Hey, you hung up on her. 
[01:23:00]  Sorry.  Well...  I have the in case of emergency break glass mouse over here.  That was an emergency.  Why?  Because that call was never going to end as long as she kept drooling over you.  She was a big girl through the hips.  A roomie.  A roomie?  Yeah.  I didn't see any honeys signing any tits there.  I mean...  No.  All right.  I signed her breasts.  I did it with a spray paint.  All right. 
[01:23:30]  Tiniest teen stands one foot eight inches tall.  Who's that?  Well, how tall is George, though?  George?  I don't know.  Taller than that.  I think you brought me.  Huh?  I got nothing to say.  He's taller than that.  Why are you sick of this, George?  Listen to this jerk off showering this morning singing Captain and Tennille songs.  My career's going good now.  Oh, they don't drink.  Everything's fantastic.  I hate your Jew guts. 
[01:24:00]  Oh, God.  Well, George, you're part of the team, man.  Otto and you killed at the PNC Arts Center.  Oh, you're the hot one.  Yeah.  And Anthony's not from the school of handsome.  Your girlfriend was very sweet.  It was so nice.  She's a very nice girl.  Yes.  She's very cool.  It's great what money can do.  Oh, stop.  She's nice.  She loves you.  Yeah.  I know.  All right.  Really fast.  This is a stupid story in the New York Post today. 
[01:24:30]  Tiniest teen stands one foot eight inches tall.  Wow.  It may not be official, but he's pretty damn small.  At 20 inches.  Oh, boy.  Kahangadra the Pamagar.  I knew it wasn't going to be from here.  14 of Nepal.  What was he, born at the top of Mount Everest?  He didn't get that oxygen?  Is possibly the tiniest fully grown human on the planet, the Himalayan Times reports.  But Tapa Magar, who weighs 9.9 pounds, cannot get into the Guinness Book of World Records yet because of his age, a Guinness spokesman told the Post. 
[01:25:00]  Why?  The record holder is Yanis Edwan of Jordan at 25 and a half inches tall.  He was 27 when the record was recorded.  So, what, you have to be a certain age to be considered a fully grown human?  A fully grown human?  He might have a growth spurt and go up to, like, 22 inches.  Oh, man.  What the hell is...  The kid wins. 
[01:25:30]  Two feet tall?  Is there pictures of this guy?  It's one feet...  It's...  One foot, eight inches tall.  20 inches.  That's 20 inches tall, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Oh, there he is.  Oh, would I just beat the crap out of him.  Oh, God.  There he is.  We got a picture.  Can we get this up on our website?  Why do you say bring out violence?  I would just...  I would just punch that...  Marionette puppet.  He does look like a puppet.  Stupid little bow legs.  He's born at a place that, like, they should have killed the whole town.  Yeah.  For, like, some kind of demonic possession. 
[01:26:00]  Some curse.  I'm sure, like, yeah, half the town was thinking they got to kill the kid, the family.  How old is he in this picture, little Pop?  I don't know.  9.9 pounds.  Probably 14.  He's probably 14 right there.  Oh, man.  Ugh.  And his little sandals on.  That is awful good.  A fist right in the middle of that little torso.  Oh, God.  Get disturbed, man.  I'd keep it in a closet and just yell at it through a hole. 
[01:26:30]  It.  Oh, God.  That's a cute story.  That's wonderful.  All right.  Well, we got Otto and George here.  We got to get Jason in here.  Yes.  Yes.  Talk about crank.  Absolutely.  He's a cute star like that waiting at me.  I know.  I'm sorry, yes.  Well, you killed, though, at the PNC, so you don't have to wait as long in the green room.  Thank you.  I'm just kidding.  Oh, God.  Keep James Bond waiting and have my stupid act in here. 
[01:27:00]  Oh, God.  All right.  We'll do a quick break, and we'll get Jason in here to talk about crank next.  Nice.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Welcome to the Opie and...

[01:28:30]  Very busy morning.  We've got to get Sean on the phone real fast from Boston.  Sean, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  All right.  I don't know how long ago it was, but I saw a comedy routine.  It was by Otto and George.  It was on the Comedy Dirtiest Dozen.  It was with Tim Allen and Chris Rock. 
[01:29:00]  1988, sir.  1988.  Oh, God.  Okay, you guys did this bit that you guys, that George went to his girlfriend's house,  and the father asked, what were your intentions with your daughter?  Yes.  And all that stuff.  I was wondering if you could do a couple of those bits from that night, if you can...  Well, I'm not on this show.  Yeah, sure.  No, there's no cursing on this show, so you're pretty much out of luck with that.  Thank you, though.  Oh, yeah.  George is very hard to censor.  The funniest thing I've ever seen in my life.  Go to laugh.com. 
[01:29:30]  You can buy my other stuff.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you, Sean.  I'm familiar with that bit, and this is as much of it as he could do.  Well, sir, I'd like to begin the evening by deveining your...  Right.  Right.  That's the last I could say deveining.  And we ain't got to stop right there.  Hey, Otto was telling me during the commercial break that you did a little behind-the-scenes  video?  Yeah, yeah.  At the PNC Arts Center?  My friend Craig Safola did it.  He just, you know, me, like, trying to not be nervous before the gig and stuff.  And made a little movie? 
[01:30:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Just kind of.  And he put some Ozzy Osbourne music to it.  I knew you'd like that.  You're in it, too.  All right.  And I think we're going to link it to opieandanthony.com.  That would be cool.  All right.  So we got Otto.  Otto's playing Gotham Comedy Club September 8th here in New York City.  September 15th and 16th, Comedy Cabaret in Philly.  That's going to be a really good show.  Blow that out.  Yeah, you'll blow that right out.  You'll saw that.  And then September 30th, Treehouse Comedy presents at Sorrento's in Danbury, Connecticut,  right?  Big time.  Where are all these...  We always stand at Danbury. 
[01:30:30]  Where's all this info for all the Otto and George fans?  I guess MySpace, Otto and George.  Otto and George.  Okay.  Something like that.  And hopefully he'll be playing the O&A Traveling Virus in Cleveland.  I hope so.  Hopefully.  We got to say hi to Jason.  Yeah.  Jason Stratham in studio, the star of Crank.  I thought you said Strap-On, then.  Strap-On.  Strap-On.  No, I never...  Oh, Statham, actually.  Sorry, I did get that wrong.  So, Statham.  How you doing, chaps?  We're doing all right.  Very good.  You doing pretty good these days? 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  Not super.  Getting some parts.  That's pretty nice.  You...  Didn't you, like, start doing some kind of a car...  Almost like a car commercial short film?  And that kind of turned into, like, the Transporter series?  No, you're talking about the chap who did the BMW ads.  That was Clive Owen, yeah.  That was...  Well, yeah, right.  You weren't in that?  No, I wasn't in that.  Damn, I thought that was in...  All right, I'm out of this.  Hold on.  I'm out.  I'm out of this interview.  By the way, that's the advantage of a pre-interview.  We could have...  Ah, a pre-interview. 
[01:31:30]  Yes, see?  We made a fucking...  There you go.  All right.  But hopefully my stupid question got dumped out of because he, uh, cursed.  But that's fine.  It's nice to know that you're doing it, Anthony.  See, I learned something.  Because I thought that was you, for God's sake.  Yeah.  They told us Jason, like, does all his own stunts and stuff in movies.  And I'm watching him as he came in a couple minutes ago.  And I...  He sits like a maniac.  You look crazy.  Because he sits...  He has to sit, like, where he's, like, really slumped down.  And he sits like a guy who's an absolute lunatic.  Ready to pounce?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's a problem.  I've got a saccharitis. 
[01:32:00]  He's already figured out how he could take out this whole room.  He's already figured it out.  I saw that as he was walking in.  Well, leading up to your appearance on our show, like, there were emails going back and  forth that you were going to do some crazy stunts today.  And you wanted a Red Bull, uh, do a Red Bull drinking contest.  Who said...  What?  Jump off the top of a bus.  Oh, what the hell we were...  Open a window.  Come on, let's start.  Will you jump?  Just jump out from the 14th floor?  No, we heard you wanted to do something crazy today, because you're going to do the walk  over with us to XM? 
[01:32:30]  Yeah, I don't know.  I've never got told of something.  You were going to dive under a bus, uh, jump on a bus, I don't know.  Something.  Something about a bus.  People setting you up to do, like...  I was going to run somebody over with a bus.  Wait, you never got told you were going to do something crazy?  Who was Steve emailing?  Yeah.  Where is Steve?  This wasn't in the pre-interview?  No.  We have a guy, uh, he said, he was going to be doing something, you'll watch when he  talks, just ignore his girlish hands and stupid, kind of homosexual ways.  As he talks to a real man.  Yeah.  Yeah, right?  Yeah.  Steve might just break down. 
[01:33:00]  You're dreamy.  If he starts to swoon, make sure you catch him.  He drives a hybrid car.  Yeah.  So he makes a lot of fun.  Yeah.  You gotta make fun of that, right?  Here he is.  Here he is.  This is Steve.  Where are you going?  Microphone.  Take care.  Take care.  Just talking about your hybrid, Steve.  It's a sexy vehicle.  So...  No, it's not.  What was going on?  Wasn't he supposed to do some crazy stunt?  Yeah, what are you talking about?  To promote crank?  What stunts?  In all the prep conversations I had with Roland about this, the backstory was that Jason was 
[01:33:30]  going to do some kind of weird stunt on the walkover.  And I'm like, well, what does he want to do?  And that was all...  And there was, well, he's going to run on cars.  All right?  Why?  And then he's going to jump on a bus.  This is all...  Who said this?  This was all coming from our booker, who...  I don't know who he was talking to.  Oh, God.  Get Roland in here.  Nice.  Pass the buck, Steve.  Thank you.  I like how Steve just passed it.  You'll notice everyone will now pass the buck.  Yeah.  And please have...  Typical.  Please have Roland say the name Tommy just once during his appearance on our show. 
[01:34:00]  Roland.  Hey, get over there next to Steve.  All right.  Get over there.  Is it a present for me?  Now we'll hear pass the buck number two.  Roland is responsible for all the fine guests we get on this radio show.  Yes.  And I was watching at an event with him yesterday.  He recognizes nobody.  Really?  I'm like, is that 50 Cent?  He goes, yes, it is.  He's a 400-pound black guy in a hat.  He did look like 50 Cent, though. 
[01:34:30]  I heard him.  We were walking.  He goes, Jay-Z is behind you.  And he wasn't.  No.  No.  It's an old woman.  Some security.  I'm like, why is Jay-Z wanting people?  All right.  So where are we at now?  Like, Steve is saying that you said that Jason would do some crazy stunt to promote Crank.  Opening a theater is Friday.  We were trying to work out something, but then it just didn't happen.  It was just between us and other people.  So he had no clue.  But he isn't cool.  Shouldn't he be the guy that's in on the conversation?  But we're going to pass out free Crank memorabilia during the walkover. 
[01:35:00]  That's crazy.  Wow.  I hope no one gets hurt.  Yeah, but even when a guy does it.  Wow, we're the most outrageous show on radio, I got to tell you.  Can I have a safety mat for that?  Right, right.  Give me a harness.  So you were talking with people and he had no clue about this.  And you're like threatening him harm.  Harm could have come to him.  You guys are figuring this out.  Because I heard ride on the top of a bus and you would jump between two buses. 
[01:35:30]  And you're just talking about this without his knowledge.  Possibly.  It's just going to plant old banana skins all over the walkthrough.  Oh, that's dangerous.  You could slip on those.  Oh, you'd fall down.  So wait, who were you talking to?  Different people, though.  Different people.  Different people.  I would assume you aren't talking to your staff.  What is this, Fox News?  Yeah.  People are saying.  You don't have to mention their names, but what is their title?  We were just working out with the company to see if we could do promotion. 
[01:36:00]  But shouldn't the guy be in on the conversation?  It's all very vague.  The syndicate.  I know.  I was talking with the syndicate.  All right.  Reagan gave better answers during the questioning.  Oh, well, you know, we were on with the company, with the man.  You're not fessing up.  So, Jason, there's going to be no stunts today?  There's no stunts today.  Instead, this outrageous radio show will be handing out T-shirts or something?  Sometimes you might hold one, and the wind blows it up in your eyes. 
[01:36:30]  You get hit.  That could hurt.  Where's the shirt?  You're pretty much too big a star.  Oh, wow.  Thank you, money.  We're going to be handing out posters of Jason.  Don't pull that out.  And, yes, there's the T-shirt.  Oh, man.  I want a shirt.  You know how sharp the corner of that poster is?  Look at that.  We definitely put an eye out.  What's wrong with us?  My God.  You do your own stunts or some of them or more you used to as opposed to now because now you're probably a little more important. 
[01:37:00]  Well, now they start to get a bit concerned.  They're like, yeah, maybe you should have someone else.  Yeah.  What was the craziest stunt you did in a movie?  In this one, I suppose, you know the skids of a helicopter, the landing skids.  So I'm standing on that and we do a fight scene about 2,000, 3,000 feet above downtown L.A.  He's sort of secured by a little hip pick and a small harness and you've got plenty of room to move about.  So, yeah, it's quite scary.  But you are hanging outside a helicopter. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, yeah.  You don't really realize how scary it is.  Wait, are you hanging from them or you're standing on them?  You're standing on them but you're having a lot of fights.  All right, so you're holding on standing and you're fighting.  So you're leaning back and you're fighting.  Oh, my.  But as you're traveling up, all of a sudden you think, no, I can handle this.  And then you get the old sewing machine legs start to go.  It's that uncontrollable twitch.  You would care.  And you go, you think you've bitten off more than you can chew.  So, yeah, you kind of scare yourself but it's too late. 
[01:38:00]  Man, how much driving do you actually do?  I do a fair amount.  Yeah.  You know, I used to screw around when I was a kid.  Yeah.  We used to drive, you know, from North London to South London.  All my pals, we used to race down there.  Yeah.  In the little GTIs.  So, yeah, I had a fair amount.  But they probably cut back on that too, right?  Guy's too important.  He's got another three pictures for this company, damn it.  We can't have them busted up.  Yeah, they don't tend to let you do as much as you want.  That's got to suck because it sounds like you really enjoy doing your own stunts. 
[01:38:30]  So, you've got to be itching like, oh, man, I could do a better job than this guy.  Let me do this.  Well, usually, yeah.  I mean, if you think you can do it, you might as well do it.  Yeah.  But they just don't want to see you come to any harm.  Yeah.  I wouldn't do anything.  All right, let's say hi to...  I'd have to tie my shoe.  Yeah, let's say hi to Jeff in New Jersey.  Jeff.  I'm a pussy.  Hey, just wanted to say hey, Jay.  Good luck with the new movie.  Love the other two with Transporter.  Just an excellent job. 
[01:39:00]  Nice one, mate.  Thanks for that.  All right.  You have a great day and everybody else also.  Thanks.  That was inspiring.  That was...  Could have been the best phone call of the day.  Let's say hi to Andrea in New York City.  Andrea.  Hi.  Jason, you're gorgeous.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, the chicks dig you.  Can you see?  You're gorgeous.  Yeah.  What was the name of that movie when you were the driver and you had the sequel to it as  well?  That was your big movie?  That was the Transporter films, I think. 
[01:39:30]  That was really good.  I'm sorry.  I can't remember.  That was awesome.  Thank you, Chris Farley.  You were so hot in those.  Yeah.  Wow, this is going great.  We love the audience.  Good day, guys.  Bye.  Yeah, we'll try another one.  Keith in Philly.  Keith.  Yo, what up, guys?  Hey.  Jason, man.  Loved you in Lockstock.  Come on, mate.  You've got to say something funny. 
[01:40:00]  Everyone's falling asleep.  Yeah.  Did he have a question about the movie?  What did you like about Lockstock?  The comedy.  I think he used to be doing more comedies, man.  He's hilarious.  Yeah.  Yeah, everybody thinks so.  They're splitting their sides over him.  Fucking handing out the red noses.  Well, no.  The callers today are a little slow.  We get that sometimes.  In certain days, the callers just call up and go,  Hey, Jason, that thing you did shot on 35 millimeter. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  And they just run out of thought.  Yeah.  What was that movie where you were wearing the shoes?  Something about the shoes.  Right.  You were running with the guy who didn't come.  Heidi.  Yes.  Help us out here.  Let's go.  I just wanted to talk to Jason.  He's here.  Oh, well, he's right here.  Talk.  Oh, Jason, I just wanted to say that I love your movies.  I've been watching you and Guy Ritchie's films, Lost Stock and Two Smokin' Barrels.  You're gorgeous. 
[01:41:00]  Your accent is so sexy.  And I just love you.  Every movie you've ever been in.  Nice.  Good man.  Did you like Snatch?  I did.  I love Snatch.  I love that movie.  I love Transporter.  And you love Snatch.  Good.  I love Snatch.  We all love Snatch.  Yeah, you got that accent.  I've talked about before about Opie.  He's cute, too.  She's fickle.  All right.  Thank you.  All right, cool.  She's fickle.  I feel like anybody who's kind of halfway decent looking and has money. 
[01:41:30]  I don't blame you.  Where'd she go?  We're done with her.  So what were we saying then?  I'm wondering how you even got into the business.  Well, I used to work like perfume and jewelry out of a briefcase on street corners for like  Really?  Hawking wares out of a briefcase?  Yeah.  A hustler?  A hustler?  Yeah, my dad used to.  Have you heard of the mock auctions?  It's like a big empty shop where you get all different wares up and you conduct kind of 
[01:42:00]  an auction.  But basically, you know, you're ramming people, as we say, with a load of crap.  And basically, my dad had one of those.  There was tons of those around in the sort of early 80s.  This was big in London?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So the mock auctions, it was a big thing.  So my father had that.  Wait.  So I walk in.  I'm thinking I'm getting something of quality and it's just junk?  No, basically, it's an empty shop and then you pull the pitch, which you basically lure  people in, telling them, you know, you put them in promised land, telling them they're 
[01:42:30]  going to get a lot of stuff for nothing.  And that creates the crowd.  And then the top man steps up and they do systems where they, you know, they entice people  to buy by giving them free gifts to go with a reduced price on a certain item.  So it's like an auction.  Wow.  Basically, you know, you're sort of filling everybody up with a lot of crap.  Scam.  Yeah.  So I learned, you know, I learned the spiel and the different systems that you can work 
[01:43:00]  within the mock auction and applied it to selling jewellery and perfume on the streets.  So basically, that's what I did for years.  And then Guy Ritchie had written a movie called Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.  And one of the characters within the movie was a street corner con man.  So there was no acting.  It was just me turning up and saying a few words.  Would he just find you on the street or?  No, there was a, we had like a mutual friend, someone that was an investor, a wife of the  investor, knew me and knew him.  So it was pure chance.  One of those luck. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  Lucky bastard.  Wow.  Guy Ritchie kind of made you, right?  You found your.  Yeah.  So, you know, he'd give me a shot at being a, being an actor.  Yeah.  Has he changed since being with Madonna?  I mean, I've known him since, you know, since day one.  So he's still the same old person to me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you know Madonna?  Yeah.  Oh, it's a weapon in that.  Yeah.  Look at you.  Nice.  A little starstruck.  Yeah, this is impressive.  Can I get a picture?  She's very attractive.  You're going to get a picture, aren't you? 
[01:44:00]  Madonna?  No.  Oh, Jason.  Yeah, let's say hi to David in Texas.  David?  Hey.  Hey.  They are showing Crank tonight in Dallas.  It's at the Improv in Edison.  They're showing Crank at the.  Eight o'clock.  Oh, okay.  Thank you, sir.  Apparently, Crank is being premiered in.  Is it not yet?  Cheesy plug for Jimmy Norton.  It comes out?  It comes out.  Okay.  Yeah.  What's Crank about?  We haven't even talked about the movie yet.  It's about a hitman who finds out he's been poisoned.  He has an hour to live unless he keeps his adrenaline pumping. 
[01:44:30]  Nice.  And buys himself enough time to find an antidote.  And, you know, if he does that, he can get the guy who killed him.  Yeah.  It says Crank is in real time.  In real time.  That's what it says.  It's like Crank's film running time is 83 minutes long and it's in real time.  So it's every minute in the movie, actually, like 24 every episode is an hour.  Is that what Crank is?  Like it's really 83 minutes in the life of the hitman?  Probably not. 
[01:45:00]  Nah.  I wouldn't have thought so.  But who wrote this up and gave me this awful impression?  Same man who had told you I was doing a stunt today.  Wait.  I mean, I got distracted because I got to communicate.  What happened?  I just said to Jason.  I got to hear it now because I love when you get annoyed.  I just asked Jason.  What happened?  I figured I'd talk a little bit about the film.  He said it's about a hitman who is poisoned.  Right.  And has to keep his adrenaline going to find, you know, to keep himself alive.  Yeah.  So I said, okay, so is it in real time?  And I figured he'd go, yes, it is. 
[01:45:30]  And we'd have a chat.  Right.  And he goes, what?  And I said, well, it says the Crank is in real time because it says it here.  Crank film running time, 83 minutes long.  So I'm like, is that really like 83 minutes in the life of the hitman?  Yeah.  And he goes, no, I wouldn't think so.  You know, maybe.  I don't know.  Maybe they meant it's real time that you'll be sitting in the theater.  Oh, which is pretty much like, how about saying that Crank is a visual as well as auditory experience?  What dummy wrote this and where did you get it? 
[01:46:00]  Let's say hi to Darren.  We've never had as much erroneous information as we have with you sitting here.  Roland did?  What's Roland?  Roland made it sound like we were going to have an action adventure today.  A real time stunt extravaganza.  Roland, what's going on?  We got him in wrong movies.  He's not doing stunts.  It's not in the real time.  It starts like once he gets injected, the 60 minutes starts.  Oh, yeah.  So there is an hour time frame.  Yeah, an hour time frame.  Like once you get injected, it's like an hour.  Wouldn't he know he's in the film?  Yeah.  Thank goodness you know because I didn't have a clue. 
[01:46:30]  Have you even seen your own film yet, Jason?  Not yet, no.  All right.  So maybe we know more than that.  It's a romantic comedy, I think.  Roland looks like a gay Napoleon.  Oh, no.  Here come the photoshops.  Oh, no.  Hey, let's say hi.  Where were we going?  Darren in Kings Park, I believe.  Darren, what's up?  How are you guys doing?  Good, man.  Hello, Darren.  What's going on, O&A? 
[01:47:00]  We're rocking.  Cool.  Jason, got a quick question for you.  I heard on the set of The Italian Job, you and Charlize Theron, I heard she, you know,  thought she all brage old.  What's that, mate?  Can you speak English?  It's basically insinuating that there was some kind of a romance.  You may have got a little piece.  Get out of it.  She's got a boyfriend that I know quite well.  No, you got your information wrong there, sunshine. 
[01:47:30]  No, not at all, huh?  No, no.  All those rumors get going whenever you make a movie together with, like, you know, attractive  girl.  Have you been talking about that?  Is Wahlberg a fag?  Is Wahlberg a fag in real life?  What do you think?  Is Mark Wahlberg a fag?  No.  Why am I answering?  I don't know him.  Why would he be?  I mean, come on.  What makes you say that, anyway?  This guy got one of Roland's sheets.  Yes.  He's reading off it right now.  Jason hooked up with Charlize Theron, and Mark came in, but then Mark was only interested  in Jason.  What did you hear? 
[01:48:00]  The crap.  Hey, we got to take a quick break.  We got Otto and George.  We got Jason Statham.  Crank opens on Friday.  You're hanging, obviously.  I just got to communicate.  We got to take a break, because Edward Norton wants to call in and say hi.  Oh, nice.  You know Edward?  Yeah, I know Edward, yeah.  You know Edward?  Okay, he's going to be calling the show in a few minutes here.  Oh, great.  The Illusionist is out.  Is it out yet?  Yeah, it is out.  I saw it last week.  Don't ask Roland.  The reviews are amazing on this film.  I took it on vacation.  Everyone that I went on vacation with saw the movie, and absolutely, I'll tell him, absolutely 
[01:48:30]  loved it.  You'll tell him you took a bootleg copy and let everybody watch it?  Oh, great.  What?  It was a legal copy, wasn't it?  Yeah, it's out Friday-wide.  You got to get a bus.  God, we got to get rolling on the show more.  Wow.  Wow.  It's out Friday-wide.  Are you sure it's Edward Norton?  He probably scheduled me for a phoner.  Why are you so nervous? 
[01:49:00]  I don't know.  I'm tired.  Wow.  That was one of the worst.  It's out-wide.  It's Friday-wide.  It's out-wide.  Who's calling?  Ed Norton?  I think he's in prospect.  He's the greatest.  He recognizes nobody.  I'm surprised he knows who you two are.  What about Mr. Lee?  Is he going to be calling the show soon?  Mr. Lee?  Yeah.  Rock star?  Oh, yes.  In two weeks, he's coming to New York. 
[01:49:30]  Wait, what's his name again?  Tommy Lee.  Holly.  Wait, who?  Wait, who?  Tommy Lee.  Did I just say it?  Tommy Lee.  Tommy Lee.  Tommy Lee.  Tommy Lee.  Tommy Lee.  Tommy Lee.  What?  What time is Edward Norton calling?  Between 830 and 835.  All right, we've got to take a break.  That's Mexican food, isn't it?  Tamale.  Tamale.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Hey, you're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yep.  Okay.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:50:00]  Opie and Anthony.  We've got to get right back into this.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  We've got Jason Statham.  Sorry.  I can't say your last name.  The new movie's crank.  It's in theaters on Friday.  We've got Otto and George in studio.  And on the phone, a new friend of the show.  Edward Norton.  Wow.  I'm waiting, waiting, waiting.  Here we go.  Ed Norton. 
[01:50:30]  Edward.  Edward.  Edward Norton.  How are you?  What's up, buddy?  There he is.  How you doing, man?  Jim Norton, my brother.  How you doing?  He is your brother.  That was the first thing he said to me when I met him.  I didn't know what to say to Edward Norton.  I was really starstruck.  And he goes, my brother's name is Jim.  I'm like, oh, cool.  And I just stood there with nothing to respond like an idiot.  Yeah.  We have someone.  You had just done the routine about your nipples, I think.  He remembers that.  He saw me at the cellar.  And it was a really good show.  And I did something on my nipples. 
[01:51:00]  And he just remembered.  I think he commented.  Oh, thank you.  It's true, too.  I can't function without it.  And again, I just can't stand when a big Hollywood star recognizes Jimmy.  You know what it is?  People like Edward and myself, men of our ilk, we tend to band together.  Enough of your ilk.  Had it with you and your ilk.  Hey, we got a friend of yours in studio, someone you might know there, Edward.  Who's that?  How you doing, Edward?  It's Jason.  Jason Statham?  Yes, mate.  What the hell are you doing there? 
[01:51:30]  Exactly.  Yeah, the show's a bit hard up before they get me in.  Bring you in for a bit of the old Cockney, right?  Well, he was supposed to do some over-the-top stunt for us, but I guess that's not happening.  Now we're just going to be handing out posters today.  For Crank.  I'm going to sell you a fake Cartier.  It went severely downhill.  Did you hear that, though?  I'm going to tell you the joke about the guy with the alligator on the bar and the old  lady in the corner.  I'll tell you, apparently Edward does a really good impression on me, so you might want to 
[01:52:00]  hear it.  Well, he said something about selling a fake Cartier, so I guess he knows your history,  right?  Yeah, he does.  Yeah, I owe him a refund.  Jason was the one redeeming factor in the experience of the Italian job.  Yeah.  Oh, is that a bad one?  A bad time?  Oh, no, no.  I'm teasing him.  It was a great gang.  That was the best part of it.  Is this joke worth hearing?  Can we hear it, Jason?  No, Edward, if you want to go and tell him.  I think nobody can tell it. 
[01:52:30]  I can't tell it like Jason.  Whenever I tell it, I try to sound like him, and it's not as good.  There's a lot of swearing in it.  Oh, is it funny?  Of course there is.  He knows you can't do it.  Hey, Roland told us, and Roland has been really weird with information today.  He's been giving us all the wrong info.  By weird, he means completely wrong and inaccurate.  Completely wrong.  So did you just get your pilot's license?  Not just, but a couple years ago.  Oh, a couple years ago.  All right, at least that's the proper information.  It's just years old.  Okay, Roland made it seem like he got this yesterday. 
[01:53:00]  He's like, oh, it just happened.  No.  No.  Again, Roland is wrong.  He's cringing in the corner.  You do a lot of flying?  I do, yeah, yeah.  Yeah?  It's a passion.  Got your own plane?  I do.  Nothing fancy, you know.  You're not like John Travolta with a big 707 in your backyard?  No, no, no, no.  I got to make a lot more big, dumb movies to afford one of those.  Hey, can you fly, I guess, what do they call it, instrument qualified?  I mean, can you just fly, you can fly at night and all that stuff? 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, yeah.  That's what JFK Jr., when he was flying, he wasn't qualified, so at night he didn't know  how to use, like, the night stuff.  Was that his big problem?  Yeah, he wasn't instrument rated.  Okay.  VFR, Jimmy.  VFR.  What's that?  Visual flight rules.  I'm trying to have a discussion about flying.  I don't know anything, like, technical.  I just, like, does it have wings?  Yeah, you're way out of your element here.  I know, I'm just trying to sound smart, so I asked the instrument question, but I said  it like a novice idiot that I am.  Well, good, so two years ago he got his pilot's license.  That's great. 
[01:54:00]  You want to talk about his new movie, Fight Club, you idiot?  He's got this kid in it, Brad Pitt, he's going to knock you out.  Yeah, I hear that kid's going places.  I also see, now, this I've got to ask you about, you've been on David Letterman.  I have been.  Okay, very good.  Me and Opie are doing Letterman tonight.  Really?  It's our first time ever.  Look, he's shocked, too.  I know, I know.  Everyone we tell is shocked.  It is shocked. 
[01:54:30]  Everyone is shocked.  But I need some advice.  What do you do?  You walk out there, are you nervous?  You sit down.  What's the first thing you do?  Yeah, go back to the first time you were on.  Yeah, first time.  What was that like?  The first time I did it was the best time.  I can't say why.  You know, last time I did it, I felt like I talked too fast.  You know, I think you've got to slow down.  Okay, don't talk fast.  Let me write that on my hand.  I'll write that on my hand so I get that.  Well, it's the temptation, right? 
[01:55:00]  Because there's an audience in front of you,  and you know you're being watched by a lot of people,  and you just kind of feel like this urge to fill any vacuum of silence.  Yeah, that's right.  Did Dave help you out?  Don't keep, like, putting your fingers in your pits and then checking the smell.  Damn it.  I was going to do that.  Did Dave help you out?  Like, was it smooth?  He's great.  You don't have to.  He's right there with you.  And did you drink at all before you went on?  I did not.  See, Luke Wilson told us to drink.  Yeah, Luke Wilson said have a couple of Heinekens before you go in there. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, there's that.  I'd drink something warm.  I'm telling you, it is cold in there.  Be ready.  He likes his comedy served cold.  That's what everyone says is how freezing cold it is in there.  Like 50-something degrees.  Like, he's legendary for liking a very perfect, you know, Jim's nipples.  They would harden up really nicely.  I would wear just, like, a white T-shirt and show them off.  You want to put Band-Aids on them or something.  Some pasties.  Oh, okay.  That's good advice.  Don't talk fast.  Don't put your fingers in your armpits and smell them.  And slow down. 
[01:56:00]  And slow down.  Edward Norton, The Illusionist, getting great reviews.  Yeah, it's a lot of fun.  I think, you know, in the vein of ones I've done like Primal Fear or the score with a good  twist at the end, this is, you know, it's an entertaining night at the movies.  I watched, I'm sorry, man.  I watched, I hope you've seen it.  I have not seen it.  I have only seen it.  No, I haven't seen The Illusionist.  I got, maybe I shouldn't admit this, but I, you know, I got a copy because, you know,  we're in the know.  Is that okay to say I got a copy, you know, because it was a studio copy. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah, to preview the movie because we were going to talk to Edward Norton.  I went on vacation.  I was doing some boogie boarding and I never got to see the film, which I'm bummed at.  But everyone else in the house.  You told it to a guy on Canal Street.  No.  But everyone else in the house, because it was a house filled with, I don't know, 15 or 20 people.  They all saw it and they thought it was unbelievable.  And, and they were trying to tell me this twist thing at the end.  I'm like, don't tell me until I see the movie.  Don't ruin it.  But they loved the movie, Edward.  Good.  Good.  Yeah, it's, it is fun.  There's some great actors in it.  Paul Giamatti is one of my favorite guys out there right now. 
[01:57:00]  And, um, it was, it was a kick to work with him.  And Jessica Biel was hot and, um, I feel like her.  The previews I was watching, we don't have the sound on the televisions here.  So the preview just kind of showed you the stage was black and you were doing something  and you're rushing and kiss a girl, but it was almost, it had a vibe like the only description  is magic with Hopkins.  That was for some reason what it reminded me of that, just like a really chilling, creepy  kind of vibe.  What type of character are you?  It's a, it's a little more, uh, you know, romantic than, than that, than magic. 
[01:57:30]  But it's, um, but it's, but it is, it is a dark mystery, you know, it's, it's, um, kind  of got elements of the supernatural in it.  And it's, uh, it's a, it's a, it's a lot of fun.  Let me ask you this as like, as an actor who, what I do is I basically, I'd like to talk  acting with Edward Norton because that's what I need to help with.  All right.  I basically read dialogue and I just pray that they can't see through my flimsy performance.  It's an honest assessment. 
[01:58:00]  That's what I do.  It's just like, all right, they said rap.  All right, good.  We're done.  Do you, are you like, my turn, my turn.  Yeah.  That's what I do.  When they're talking, I just think not my turn, not my turn.  And then I hear my cue or did I go talk, talk, talk, and then I stop.  And then hopefully they'll talk without yelling, cut, redo that.  Do you, are you like, uh, I know this is like a novice question, but are you like, are you,  are you consider yourself a method actor or what like method do you use?  Or do you not use one in particular at all?  I never, I mean, uh, I think that's the word gets tossed around.  A little too loosely. 
[01:58:30]  I, I, I, I'm not sure.  I, I'm not sure I believe in anything for, for everything.  You know what I mean?  I think it's like, I think everything's, I mean, the method acting doesn't help you much  on death to smooch it.  You know what I mean?  It's like, uh, so, um, so I think you got to tailor it to the, uh, to the moment, to the  moment.  We were doing a lot of method acting on the Italian job, weren't we, Chase?  Oh, tons of it.  I mean, we were, we were deep inside those characters.  Wote, very deep.  We were deep inside those, uh, those Cooper minis. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah, something tells me there are stories that go on with those movies where there's  a big crew of you guys hanging out that just will never, ever get out.  Some of those stories just cruising around foreign countries.  Swans of secrecy.  Impregnating women and causing problems.  Problems.  I think I got out of that trouble.  Jason seems like, this is my impression of Jason, like when he came in, he seems like  a really nice guy, but who has a switch where he just turns into a sociopath immediately. 
[01:59:30]  Jesus.  Yeah, see, he just seems like he's.  Yeah, he's looking, he's giving you that look now.  But he seems like he's.  Like a little Vixby thing, you know, don't make me angry when I'm angry.  Is that what he's like?  Is he pleasant for a while and then there's a problem and he just starts biting people?  I don't know.  Somehow I stayed on his good side.  I'm a peaceful man.  I'm into knitting and flower arranging.  He's another one of these guys that would headbutt you.  Yeah.  We were just talking about this the other day.  You would headbutt us, make it hurt real bad and smile the whole time.  Well, any guy from England with a shaved head we all assume is a soccer hooligan or something 
[02:00:00]  where there's just headbutting going on and then beer drinking and laughing.  Who was that guy, Jason, we used to talk about the gent.  No, no, who was Lenny the.  Lenny McClain.  Lenny McClain, right?  Yeah.  He was a method actor.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What was he?  No, he's actually a bare knuckle boxer.  But I can remember in one of his interviews, someone said to him, they were interested in  his technique.  And they said to him, they were saying like, Lenny, is it true you never went to drama 
[02:00:30]  school?  And he went, listen, I've had a thousand ballroom brawls.  I've been shot four times.  I've been stabbed a dozen times.  Isn't that enough drama for anyone's fucking lifetime?  I'm such a, when I can, like, you know how you look at other men, like, what they do  and, like, you realize you're in the same kind of genetic competition.  It's like, that's what I'm up against, like, as a male to survive.  I'm a girl.  I'm a girl. 
[02:01:00]  That's good.  You're a nice, self-confident girl.  Well, you know.  It's just how the DNA's mixed.  You know.  What are you working on right now?  They said you're shooting something right now.  No, I'm, I did a film with Naomi Watts that we made in China last year that's coming out  later this year that I actually like a lot.  But I'm taking a little break.  Okay, relaxing.  Yeah, you're just trying to do a movie with every hot chick in Hollywood.  Is that your goal here?  Well, it took me, like, ten years to realize I was making movies with all the wrong people. 
[02:01:30]  I was, like, making movies with Jason and Mark Wahlberg and Brad Pitt, and it's like,  that's not sexy.  Good decision, man.  And then you do one or two with one of these girls, and, you know, you go, wait a minute,  like, what was I caring about artistic, you know, ambition for it?  It's like, this is what it was, this is why I got into this in the first place, to meet  girls, you know?  Yeah.  That is at least honest.  It's great.  I mean, that's why most guys, I think, become entertainers of some sort, is you get tired  of seeing chicks run off with jocks, and you decide, this is what I can do. 
[02:02:00]  Jessica's ridiculous, huh?  Is she just so hot?  Yeah, you know, I didn't know when we were going to make the movie, I didn't, if I'd known  she was, like, you know, the, whatever, Esquire Magazine sexiest woman, I'd have paid more  attention to her.  I know.  No, I'm kidding.  I don't.  Yeah.  No, no, she's a great girl.  She's a great girl.  She's actually kind of salt of the earth.  She's a real tomboy and real fun to hang around with.  Really, really solid, solid girl.  Solid's a good word to use.  That's an excellent word to use. 
[02:02:30]  Well, dude, this is what you got to do.  When you're working with guys like Brad Pitt, and you're working with guys like, you know,  that handsome, you got to work with really awful looking people.  You don't want to surround yourself with Mark Wahlberg, especially, I mean, Dirk Diggler  is not his real life.  Every woman wants to find out if he's really packing like that.  So you got to surround yourself.  Like, I was on a show, and I'm mediocre to horrible looking.  Everybody else on the show were genetic disasters.  I was the best looking nothing on the show.  So I was like the sex symbol of the show, if that makes any sense. 
[02:03:00]  Wow.  So it's who you surround yourself with.  You need relative comparisons.  That's what I'm saying.  You don't want to work with Brad Pitt and Mark Wahlberg.  That's tough.  Yeah.  I'm going to pull it off because you're a handsome person.  I mean, it's kind of awkward to say that to another man, but it's true.  And then he can, you know, hop in the plane.  What kind of license you got?  Your jet?  No, no, no.  I'm not playing those.  Dual engine?  No, no.  So you're hopping around a little 172?  No, no.  A little better than that.  A little faster than that.  Okay.  I figured that.  What is your maximum distance you can go with it? 
[02:03:30]  Like, can you fly to actual locations or no?  Yeah, yeah.  I can go maybe a thousand miles.  Jesus.  The studio must love when he goes in the air.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, when does he land?  What time?  As soon as he lands.  Hold me.  As soon as he touches.  Do they make you sign stuff like that you won't fly while you're shooting this particular film?  You know what?  I, I, they, they probably do.  I, I, I can't really remember.  I love that.  The look at things that he signs. 
[02:04:00]  The lawyers and stuff.  Do you find yourself not flying at all when you're in production?  Well, some, last year I was, when I, like when we did the illusions, we were in Prague  the whole time and then I was in China and not a lot of civil aviation in China, let  me put it down.  No.  Yeah.  Shoot you right out of the sky.  You don't really like people flying around looking at things.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You take a little friendly flight, there's F-14s tailing you.  It's probably not smart.  Yeah.  American plane in China, sure.  All right.  We're running out of show here.  Yeah, really. 
[02:04:30]  Edward Norton, the illusionist opens on Friday, right?  That's right.  Yeah.  It, it, it's, um, it goes out wide on Friday.  Yeah.  It's getting, uh, he heard that.  He's wide.  He heard Rollins.  Yeah.  And it's getting, uh, just great reviews.  It's, it's just another great, uh, film, uh, that you're in there, Edward.  Thank you.  And, uh, I, I highly recommend everyone go see it.  Yes, I hope people check it out.  Yeah, I think they will.  I really do.  They will enjoy it.  We're, uh, we're big fans, man.  We're really glad to call that.  Absolutely.  If you're ever in New York, you got, you got to stop it.  Yeah, you live in New York.  I, I was reading just, uh, as we're doing this, that you still take the subway? 
[02:05:00]  Yeah, all the time.  It's the fastest way to get anywhere.  You know that.  Yeah.  But, but do you get recognized on the subway?  No.  No.  But, you know, they, they, they know I'm friends with Jason, so they leave me alone.  They leave me alone because there's a problem.  But are they looking at you like, I'm, that, that's Edward Norton.  He's on the subway.  Like, God, that guy looks a lot like that guy.  Yeah.  You know, Fight Club.  But it can't be, because you wouldn't be on the subway.  You disguise yourself?  Eh, you know, I mean, it depends on where you're going.  Yeah.  See, I don't disguise.  On the subway, I would think you would have to, like, wrap yourself up. 
[02:05:30]  Dude, I'm so desperate for attention.  I actually get on the subway holding a microphone and a little PA in case people don't know what  I do for a living.  I need any angle to get into a girl's pants.  Comedy's the only way in.  He's got the Ed Norton mask.  I can get you a mask.  Hey, anytime you want to.  Give me a mask of you, and I'll give you a mask of me.  All right, so that means that I'll get laid, and you'll never get work again.  I'll get into the comedy cellar, though.  Oh, you can be a comedy cellar whenever you want, man.  We'd love to have you come in here, too. 
[02:06:00]  Whenever you want to get an open invitation.  That's right.  Jason, where are you?  I'm just stuck out here for another day, and then I'm coming back over to L.A.  To L.A.?  Yeah.  All right, well.  And his movie, Crank, starts Friday as well.  Oh, there's a little competition here.  Nah.  By the way, I told you I saw your movie, didn't I?  Which?  The Illusionist.  Oh, no.  No, I thought I told you when I saw you the other week.  Ah, it's brilliant.  Oh, good, thanks.  Yeah, it's superb.  All right, so you go see... 
[02:06:30]  I'll catch Crank when I get back.  Yeah.  Do we get some good martial arts in Crank?  Not really.  Not a ton of fighting.  It's just a bit of fun, you know?  It's like a silly sort of video game type film.  Wow.  Yeah.  Not many girls apart from Amy Smart, who does take it over a newspaper stand.  Hey, mate.  Lovely way.  Keep it hot.  Really?  He's got to keep his adrenaline up.  Yeah, it's a funny scene, actually.  In front of 250 extras, you've got to try and, you know, keep your hairy ass out of sight. 
[02:07:00]  Oh, really?  Nice.  Well, I don't have a hairy ass, so I wouldn't know.  Oh, he's shy of it, yeah.  Must run in the Nortons.  Yeah, I'm actually a very smooth-bottomed boy myself.  It's the Irish.  All right, Edward Norton, thank you.  It's always a pleasure.  All right, see you guys later.  The Illusionist starts Friday.  See you on, man.  All right.  And, Jason, it was great meeting you.  Nice talking to you.  Absolutely.  Pleasure, man.  Crank is in theaters on Friday as well.  Jimmy, good luck tonight, man. 
[02:07:30]  I won't see you guys until Tuesday when we're back, but you guys are doing Letterman tonight.  I'm doing the Dallas Improv.  And, Otto, are you anywhere tonight?  No.  Be home.  Okay.  All right.  You can check Otto out.  Otto is actually flying to Dallas in a guest spot, so if you just like Otto and you hate me, come down to see him.  Oh, there you go.  I'll explain this all in Texas.  Check out Otto and George on MySpace.  All right.  Thanks for listening, guys.  We greatly appreciate it.  If you're not joining us over at XM, we'll see you tomorrow.  See you tomorrow. 
[02:08:00]  We'll see you tomorrow. 
[02:08:30]  We are publicity whorebags, publicity sluts.  We're artists.  This is all about money.  That's what it comes down to.  Because you're mercenaries.  That's clever.  Aren't you mercenaries?  We're radio mercenaries, dickhead.  We're artists.  We're entertainers.  We're not psychologists.  We're not doctors.  We're not daycare workers.  We're artists.  So it's all on appearance, none on you.  None on us.  We're artists.  None on us.  O.P. and Anthony.  I'm scared.  The O.P. and Anthony XM walkover begins now. 
[02:09:00]  It's always headphones or microphones or something phones.  Here's Otto.  Oh, I know.  So I just took the elevator down with Steve.  And there was a lot of controversy.  Where's Steve?  What's the problem?  Well, Jason had a great time.  I can say talk any time I want.  Yes.  I know.  Jason had a great time on the show, but the publicist was having like a conniption.  Like a hissy fit.  A hissy fit.  Like one of those hissy fit.  A hissy fit. 
[02:09:30]  And I guess she was trying to like break down the studio door and come in and take Jason  out or something?  What?  What happened?  Who wants to talk?  Thanks.  He doesn't want to talk.  We'll open Friday wide.  Yeah.  He doesn't want to talk because he got his ass chewed out.  I guess Jason was initially supposed to do the walkover.  I don't really know the background, but he was supposed to be on the walkover with us.  And when they heard Roland on air, one of the entourage got all pissy and decided that  Jason had to leave immediately after the on air thing up at 3 FM, despite him having 
[02:10:00]  a really good time, which was obvious.  So, but they pulled him out of here and they were all upset with Roland for going on the  air.  And I don't know.  That makes no sense.  Going on the air explaining that Jason was going to do that whole stunt thing.  Yeah, but that's all we heard about for like weeks.  Come up with something.  Come up with something.  She's over there on the phone.  Oh, really?  Is that her over there?  I don't know.  So what's the problem?  I guess nobody, nobody conveyed all these conversations that were going on.  Nobody conveyed these to Jason.  And this was the first thing he was hearing about. 
[02:10:30]  Oh, so now they look bad to Jason.  So it doesn't really concern us.  They look silly.  They were mad that they got a hair.  So they're blaming us now.  But he looks like the type of guy he couldn't care less.  He couldn't care less.  Oh, he was just having fun.  He had a great time.  We had fun with him.  He's a great guy.  New pal.  Yeah, he had a lot of fun.  And they were mad that they got a hair.  What, Roland?  Jason asked for an XM so he could listen to you guys wherever he goes.  And he will get one.  Absolutely.  A bunch of portable.  Very good.  What did Otto call Roland today?  Game of Poland. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, yeah.  The Game of Poland.  Yeah, Rod Steiger version.  Game of Poland.  Rod Steiger.  Holy shit.  All right.  Let's trot.  So there's a little controversy, I guess, is what we're trying to convey to everybody today.  Try to get into some sunlight or something.  But even if a guy's going to do his own stunts, they still have to know the guy that's driving the bus.  They can't just do it with any fucking bus.  Right, right, right, right.  Yeah.  What the hell do they think?  Oh, we hate publicists.  Why is it August 31st? 
[02:11:30]  I realize it's the last day, but it's still considered August.  Why is it fucking freezing?  Look at Anthony just walking ahead of us, just miserable.  Ah, miserable because it's not hot.  This summer stunk.  We had one heat wave, and they all jumped on the global warming bandwagon.  And everybody, stupid Al Gore, global warming.  It's fucking August 31st, and there's frost on the ground.  Yeah, well.  All right, I'm exaggerating, but it's cold a little. 
[02:12:00]  It's chilly.  All right, it's not hot.  I'll go as far to say it's not hot.  Yeah.  It should be global warming my ass.  Publicists are just the worst in general, aren't they?  Well, absolutely.  Always just kill joys.  Maybe this guy will accidentally back into a dry cleaner and wash those fucking pants.  Where is he from?  Is he just a fan?  Oh, Cooter?  I don't know.  He's got something going on.  Who's the guy with the big cap?  He's got a monopod. 
[02:12:30]  He's here a couple times on the wall.  Yeah?  So he has plenty of pictures of us.  That's good.  Wait, you freelance, my friend?  Yeah.  Love freelance?  What's?  Ah, there you go.  What happened?  Oh, yeah.  Otto and George do the Rue 57.  I don't know.  What did you want me to do?  Stand up on the corner.  Yeah, the Rue 57 tour.  Watch your back.  Yeah, it's a bus.  I know they're hard to see.  He has filthy hands.  He wants me to do my act now. 
[02:13:00]  I don't know.  He said he was going forward to stand up.  You ever get any big pictures published?  Yeah, I'm standing.  Anything big?  What's the biggest picture?  Nothing.  Nothing big.  Small stuff.  Oh, my God.  Small stuff.  Hey, how you doing there, fella?  How you doing?  Hey.  A little tardy.  Hey, Pat from Onachi.  How you doing?  He's got skinny man legs.  Yeah.  Wow, look at how emaciated those are.  He's taking pictures of his legs.  He looks like Wax Truth Derby. 
[02:13:30]  Wax Truth.  Why does that guy with the video camera, his hands are like Rory Calahone in Motel Hell?  Oh, God.  Just fucking dirty.  Planting fingers.  Motel Hell.  I don't like the fucking nurse's hat on your lens.  It's really annoying me.  All right.  Oh, this way?  Should we go this way?  What is this guy selling?  Hey, what are you selling today?  What are you selling?  What are you selling?  Oh, handbags.  Handbags.  Yeah. 
[02:14:00]  Great.  All right.  Thanks for talking to us.  All right.  All right.  Well, I'm sure that those are legitimate.  He's probably working for Bloomingdale's.  Yeah.  He's just bringing some stock over there.  Yeah.  Hi.  Hi there.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, look at the little baby.  Hello.  Little baby.  You know what we used to do with those?  We'd stick their head in gravy, and then you wash it off with bubble gum and send it 
[02:14:30]  to the Navy.  Because he's a...  You get it?  No.  Oh, you're from England.  Little baby baby.  You're a nanny, are you?  No.  What?  You're a mommy?  Granny.  A granny?  Yeah.  Well, that baby's adorable.  What's the baby's name?  Ben.  Ben?  Ben?  All right.  Ben.  Don't, don't, don't.  Ah, don't, don't.  You couldn't tell she was from England?  Just look at her teeth.  I could tell.  Where in England are you from?  London.  Oh.  Oh.  Hello, Ben. 
[02:15:00]  Hello, Ben.  Look at him looking around.  He doesn't know what's going on.  No.  How old is Ben?  He's one.  Oh, he's big for one.  He was one yesterday.  Oh, happy birthday, Ben.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday, dear Ben.  Happy birthday to you. 
[02:15:30]  All right, you won.  Hooray.  Oh.  Oh, no.  Enough.  Enough.  Enough.  We're sorry, Ben.  Ben.  Oh, jeez.  Ben.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  We suck.  What did you do?  He's not used to the paparazzi traumatizing him.  Oh, God.  He's not crying anymore.  Let's get away from Ben.  All right.  Poor Ben.  I know.  We can't traumatize Ben anymore.  Do you want to see an attorney? 
[02:16:00]  Thank you.  Bye, Ben.  There we go.  It's okay, you little guy.  An innocent child crying.  Poor thing.  Poor thing.  He's doing shit on himself.  He's just freaked out.  His whole life now is going to be filled with a fear of mediocre radio shows.  Oh, man.  He made it all the way through happy birthday.  And then the hooray part scared the little shit out of him.  Yeah.  There he is.  Ah, Pat.  Ah, you know, my leg.  Ah, man.  He looks like Mac, except Mac's leg was healthier. 
[02:16:30]  Fucking idiot, Pat.  A lot of, uh...  Wow, a lot of pictures snapping.  A lot of pictures today.  A lot of pictures.  I don't know who these people are.  And they've got, like, good cameras.  It's like shitty little camera phone cameras.  This guy is just waiting for a bus with his suitcase.  All right.  What else we got going on today?  And just to know it's going to be even colder in the studio.  That won't be.  It is wonderful. 
[02:17:00]  What are they hanging the big stars up on?  Are they taking them down?  We said we're doing 12, Jerry.  We're here the whole time.  Are they?  Is that for, um...  They're not starting to...  I don't know.  Hey, is that for Christmas?  Is that for Christmas, sir?  It's for...  It's for what?  It's a star.  The MTV Music Awards?  Nah, that'd be too late.  It's for...  What is it for?  Oh, for a film.  For a film.  What film? 
[02:17:30]  All right.  Thank you.  Aw, poor Ben.  It's for a film.  I guess they've got to make believe it's Christmas in New York.  Oh, is that it?  Is that Ben still crying somewhere?  Is that Ben still crying somewhere?  Is that Ben still crying somewhere?  Is that Ben still crying somewhere?  Is that Ben still crying somewhere?  Poor little Ben.  I know.  We made a one-year-old cry.  That's pretty friggin' despicable.  You're just trying to do a good thing.  Aw.  All right, well.  Thank you.  Otto, anything?  What?  I'm just seeing...  You got anything? 
[02:18:00]  Any observations?  On what?  Exactly.  Exactly.  We're just trying to make something happen with us.  There's nothing going on.  With this walk today.  Hey, let's go talk to Richard Belzer in 25 years.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  Hey.  Oh, it's crazy.  Mick Jagger.  All right.  George has the mirror.  Thank you, guys.  Yes, thank you.  Come on tonight.  See you exactly.  Oh, thank you.  Oh, good.  Yes, yes.  Good luck tonight.  Say hi. 
[02:18:30]  Oh, I'll sign that, sir.  Certainly.  We're talking to people.  Certainly.  Thank you, Danny.  I can hold a microphone and a pen at the same time.  I'm magical.  All right.  Oh, and it makes for a lousy autograph, doesn't it?  Do-do.  Thank you.  Do-do-do-do-do.  We're going to do about, what?  Ah.  40 more minutes of radio.  If that.  We're heading out early today.  Oh.  We got a pre-interview to do.  Yes.  Very busy, man.  With Letterman's people.  Very busy. 
[02:19:00]  Very exciting stuff.  We'll be upstairs in a few minutes.  Opium Rethony XM202.  Messican.  That sucks.  Lesbian.  I like that in a woman.  And every other kind of TV.  I love paying for sex.  This moral decay.  Huh?  Weakens all resistance.  Dude.  The onslaught of the communist masters of disease.  We're a bunch of scumbags.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Jackass.  I can't believe it.  It's a pedophile humor.  Woo!  It's depressing and horrendous. 
[02:19:30]  It's awful.  A bunch of idiots.  Perversion.  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  The Opie and Anthony program.  The virus.  The Opie and Anthony.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bath to my brain.  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Opie.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that fact.  Jim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with 
[02:20:00]  Down syndrome children.  No, baby.  That's terrible.  The Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  We're going to have to go. 
[02:20:30]  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  guitar solo 
[02:21:00]  It's cold in New York today.  Nicer in here today than it is outside.  God, I'm starting to get pumped.  Pumped!  It's going to be fun tonight.  I am so annoyed that Edward Norton, like, knows of Jimmy Norton. 
[02:21:30]  And, like, knows his act.  Like, that shouldn't bother me.  I should be happy for Jimmy.  But it just bothers me because he's such a huge actor.  Yeah, but Jimmy wants everybody to know.  Yeah.  But that doesn't mean...  You've got to give him one.  Who doesn't?  You know?  And then when someone does like that...  I don't know.  Who's the biggest celebrity that knows who you are? 
[02:22:00]  And not through this program.  No one.  Let me think.  Each other.  That's pretty much...  Bob Saget.  Okay.  That's a good one.  That's a pretty big one.  It's not Edward Norton.  Let me think.  I'm just saying because, you know...  Tyson Walter.  No.  He's a football player.  I don't even...  Is he playing for the Redskins this year?  Tyson?  Oh, I don't know.  He got...  I know he got a job, though, right?  Yeah.  I was just talking about how annoyed I am that Edward Norton knows who you are and knows  like your act and stuff. 
[02:22:30]  And I'm trying to think of who...  What celebrity knows me?  We got Bob Saget.  But that's not like, you know...  Dave Cook.  These are good ones.  Well, you know what Anthony's saying is someone who knows him that really isn't familiar with  me.  Because like when I saw Saget...  The first time I met Saget was at the Caroline's Aristocrat rap party.  And I saw...  I walked up to...  I went to get a picture with him.  And he goes, Jim Norton.  He goes, I'm a fan of your stuff.  I think it was Sidesplitters and he'd see all the...  Like the Otto and George movie, all the films.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, I know what you're saying. 
[02:23:00]  Hey, Eric, you want to take the pictures off this quickly before you get your face slapped?  David Goldblum?  What?  Are you just blurting names out now, Kenny?  Who's that?  Kenny, who are you?  Jeff.  Jeff Goldblum?  David Goldblum.  David Goldblum.  Jeff Goldblum.  Goddamn rich cunt.  Yeah.  He knows you?  Jeff Goldblum, yes, he did.  No, he doesn't.  I won't accept it.  I do a whole story in my act, a true story when I met him.  He's a fan of...  He recognized me from Tough Crowd.  David?  No, no, no.  Yes.  David Goldblum.  Pete Goldblum.  He liked you?  Wow. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah, yeah.  He knew me from Tough Crowd.  I wish I could find it.  Wow.  It's weird.  He watches Comedy Central.  I know.  And then Method Man told me I should win an Emmy.  You know, it's how it is when you're hobnobbing.  Hobnobbing.  You're just such a pain in the ass.  Well, what do you think these guys are watching?  You kind of think they're watching that stuff.  I'm a goddamn rich cunt.  I kill rich cunt.  Why didn't we have this for over there?  All right, E-Rock's got something to tell the fans.  Who's that?  Does he?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  E-Rock.  Are you coming out? 
[02:24:00]  No, Jimmy.  The hair is fake?  No, that's not fake either.  If they want to get Letterman's standby tickets, call 212-247-6497.  They're taking names now for standby tickets.  Want to get the number out again?  Jeez, how about, yeah.  That's a big thing.  That was inspiring.  Yeah, really.  That's a big thing.  Maybe we can throw it out.  Give me a whole one.  Maybe we can make it part of the thing.  I bring nothing to the table.  Hawks, plugs, stunk.  Maybe we can make it part of the pad data thing.  My name is Eric, and I hate blacks and Jews. 
[02:24:30]  Wow.  Jeez.  I forgot about that one.  Black people need to shut up.  Woof.  Oh, easy.  You are a racist.  Easy, kiddo.  Is this on?  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Boomer Esiason knows Anthony.  That's true.  Okay.  But, you know, he's a football player.  Letterman's standby tickets for Opie Anthony tonight.  There's going to be people there, but you never know.  Sometimes there are fallouts and people don't show up, 
[02:25:00]  because a lot of these tickets are bought or saved in advance by tourists  who don't wind up making it to New York.  Because years in advance, sometimes they buy, they write in for these tickets,  they get them, and then they don't show up because perhaps they were killed.  Hopefully.  Or perhaps they don't show up because they don't know who Opie and Anthony are.  Right.  And they don't care.  Do you know if you're first guest or second or who's on here?  Julianna Moore is on with us, and I'm sure we're second. 
[02:25:30]  Uh-huh.  Well, the thing is, a lot of times, let's hope that a bunch of people are going to come  and the matriarch of the family found a softball-sized lump in a bosom  and couldn't make it, so there will be some open seats.  Right.  Call now for standby tickets.  You do at times get in with these, believe me.  212-247-6497.  That's 212-247-6497.  Today outside the Letterman Theater.  What time is you guys actually getting in? 
[02:26:00]  And if you idiots aren't near here or can't make it, don't call for the tickets.  What time are you guys doing it?  Because a lot of people are going to think it's shot late.  It's not shot late.  It's 5 p.m. or something.  We have to be there.  3.30?  It's like between 4 and 5.30, something like that, you know.  We'll be inside by 4.  Okay, so you should pass your fans, actually, not just pass, but you can't be the guard?  All right, literally.  What happened?  Well, they're trying to take my pictures off here from some of the MTV photos I got yesterday, 
[02:26:30]  but it's apparently, um, it's not working.  What's Roland doing?  Damage control?  It's mad, baby.  What is wrong with people?  I don't know.  Roland looks like a jack-o-lantern.  Momo.  Or a jack-o-assern after.  Yeah, Opie.  Yeah.  What the fuck's wrong with you, man?  Why?  Why didn't you let me talk to Ed Norton?  You were on hold with 100 people.  Yeah, what did you want to say?  And it's Edward, stupid.  That's why you didn't get through.  He's like being called Ed.  Edward.  He's my favorite actor. 
[02:27:00]  I have very rarely been able to talk to big stars like that.  Okay.  And then I call up to one time, and you don't put me on.  What would you mean?  You know what?  How am I supposed to know that?  First of all, you got through to the, uh, through, you know, past the screener, and you  were on, and I could have went to you, but, um,  we had everybody calling.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I hear you.  But you know what?  I've been there from, from the beginning of XM when no one else would love me.  Who is that?  Some bum. 
[02:27:30]  Babbling.  Idgit.  That's all right.  I wonder what he would have liked to have asked.  What's going on?  They're planning their departure.  10-15?  We're on 12-15 flight.  What's wrong?  Get there early.  All right, yeah, I gotta go.  I gotta go home and pack.  Yes.  You can't make it to me.  A pack?  I have to.  I gotta finish packing.  How did you not pack?  I got most of it.  I gotta finish.  All right. 
[02:28:00]  Let me pull the truck around, and I'll call you in 15 minutes, and you come down.  No, I'll just be there, because I'll get home faster.  By the time he gets the truck, and the whole thing, he talks to the guy, it's a nightmare.  It takes forever.  You should meet me there at, uh, like, 10 after.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Brian.  Brian?  Hey, Brian.  Brian.  What's up?  Welcome aboard, Brian.  Hey, Brian.  How you guys doing, man?  Better now.  Hey, there, uh, Opie.  You gotta change your saying from, I'm a black ninja to, I am a faggot, because you had nothing  to say to Jason when he dropped the F-bomb twice on CBS. 
[02:28:30]  See ya.  What was that?  Well, because it was, no, you know what?  You can't even really hear the fuck when it's the English accents that thick, you know?  What was I supposed to say?  We're trying, like, when guests and people now curse on our show, we're pretty much not  stopping the program, because we know.  Yeah, we're not gonna stop them.  Because we know the people with the XM are getting it.  And we know that, uh, it's being taken care of, uh, down the hall.  Right.  So, it's not gonna go out over the air, but we're not gonna stop the flow of the conversation.  He wanted me to stop the show and go, Jason, don't curse, because they're dumping out, 
[02:29:00]  which I do from time to time.  But also, there are times we just let it go, because we're in the middle of a flow, and  the XMers are hearing it anyway.  They're not missing out.  I gotta go, um, I gotta do a phone call first.  Yeah.  Ah, it's a banana, people.  He picked up a banana, put it to his ear, as if it were a phone.  That's a visual.  Oh, that is hysterical, though.  Getting a little punchy.  Ah, so tonight I'm going to the Dallas Improv.  Guys, have a great show, man.  Thank you, James.  And possibly a strip club afterwards. 
[02:29:30]  Ooh.  The Lodge.  Maybe, but I think I wanna watch a little bit tonight.  And Legs and Eggs.  Um, oh, I don't go for that.  Dallas is known for, like, this thing after the bars close.  It's called Legs and Eggs.  Really?  I'm trying to have less cholesterol.  Or eggs and legs.  I'll date Heather Mills.  Are you gonna go to Dealey Plaza and see where the Kennedy thing is?  Yeah, I got a photo on the X.  We went.  You did?  You went there, yeah?  Yeah, I was there.  We went.  Really?  Yeah, we came, we had the best afternoon there.  It looks a lot smaller than you would think, right?  It looks like a movie set.  Yeah.  Because you've seen it so many times over the years, it looks like it's not real. 
[02:30:00]  And you don't realize there's a mirror of it on the other side.  Like, it's the same mirror of it on the other side.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  The other side of Dealey Plaza, yeah, it's exactly like just a mirror image.  Yeah.  Like Jimmy just said.  And there's actually brainstorming.  No one pays attention to that side.  It's all much nicer.  Nothing happened there.  Yeah, I know.  But it's weird because it's the exact same thing.  You know, something horrific could happen there and it wouldn't matter.  Right.  Yeah.  There's going to be an 80-car pileup.  Death, destruction, doesn't matter. 
[02:30:30]  Jimmy talks about it in his act.  It's a great bit that Jimmy used to do about we almost saw a lady buy it as she was trying  to get her picture on the X.  Really?  Because they don't stop traffic.  There's a red light at the top of the hill.  And as soon as that light changes, they don't give a shit about some dumb tourists from wherever.  Yeah.  And she's getting her picture done and the car pretty much had to, you know, come to a complete  stop right in front of her.  I'd love to get up in that window and have some idiot on that X smile in for their picture  and just shoot their head right off. 
[02:31:00]  They don't just blow their head off.  They don't want you near the window anymore.  It's glassed off.  It's all glassed off in a box.  Really?  In a glass box.  Yeah.  Sure.  I mean...  What the fuck is that about?  I want to go up there and look for some traces.  No, you used to be able to go and go right up to the...  And look out the window.  Right.  But now you can't get the perspective because it's...  Why?  Conspiracy.  Yeah.  Oh.  They don't want you to figure it out.  All right, guys.  Figuring it out.  I got to go.  But I always say, like I say, always leave them laughing.  Ah, he put his sunglasses on upside down. 
[02:31:30]  You know, you want to see gags like this, you come to the show tonight.  If not, you stay home.  Wow.  Just to finish the Dealey Plaza story, I think it was maybe a couple years ago now, someone  actually did commit suicide on the X.  Yep.  Really?  Uh-huh.  Where Kenny was shot.  What a coincidence.  And what was their name?  C.  Just wow.  It doesn't fucking matter.  Oh, yeah.  He thought he was making a statement, I guess.  Unoriginal ass.  Jack Franklin Carr. 
[02:32:00]  Stephen Carr.  Stephen Carr.  Stephen Carr.  Lead singer of the band Foundry.  Asshole.  Dump Sheet.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Let's take a break.  Bye, Jim.  Oh, we're going to take a break first.  Yeah.  We're going to take a leak.  All right.  Island Georgian studio.  Yeah.  And we'll continue.  Bye.  What the hell is going on?  The Opie and Anthony show.  Too loaded long.  Too loaded long.  Too loaded long.  Yeah.  Too loaded long. 
[02:32:30]  Shit.  It's a...  It's a...  It's a...  It's a...  It's a...  It's a...  It's a...  It's a...  It's a...  It's a...  It's a...  It's a...  One, two, three, come.  Where do you go?  Where do you go?  Where do you go?  The yellow one's in the spot.  Yeah, yeah, big whoop, no one can.  Go, and you suck.  Go, baby, Jenny.  Go.  Oh, man, this is so intense.  You suck!  Thank you very much.  Sucker! 
[02:33:00]  Hey, shut up, you're gonna eat it.  Here you go, and you're in here.  That's the winner.  Check, please, this is gone.  Oh, thank you.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  A lot of distractions today.  A lot of excitement in the air.  We're pumped.  Beyond pumped.  Beyond pumped.  Beyond pumped.  Like, even that CNN thing.  Oh, alright.  Oh, thank you. 
[02:33:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  A lot of distractions today.  A lot of excitement in the air.  We're pumped.  Beyond pumped.  Like, even that CNN thing?  Oh, yeah, all right.  We do have that.  Iliketolisten.com.  Yeah.  We do, like, poll questions.  Poll. 
[02:34:00]  Iliketolisten.com.  You go there and you take a poll.  And then someone wins something, I think.  Oh, fuck.  What do they get for doing this?  What's the motivation to the Opie and Anthony fan to go to Iliketolisten.com?  Make E-Rock happy.  It makes E-Rock happy, which makes who happy?  I don't know.  Latest question.  I don't know.  What is the latest question now?  How do you rate this vacation's worst of?  It was brilliant. 
[02:34:30]  Directly reflect.  It was good.  It was just okay.  It sucked.  I'm a crybaby.  Who heard all this before?  Play something different.  Wow.  I can't wait to go home and log on to Iliketolisten.com and take the poll.  I don't know.  I'm not sure if I should.  I'm going to go with it was good.  I don't know.  What was the choice after it was good?  It was just okay.  I didn't listen to any of it, but I'm putting it was just okay. 
[02:35:00]  This is a self-serving question by E-Rock.  Yeah, it really is.  Because E-Rock is the guy who has to come up with the poll question.  Harumphs from the other room.  Did you see that?  Harumphs all around.  All right.  Maybe pest poll number two will be a little better.  All right.  This is on Iliketolisten.com.  When do you listen to the O&A show?  That's an exciting question.  When do you listen?  When the show is live during the replay or I record it and listen when I feel like it. 
[02:35:30]  Holy shit.  I would think.  Can you get the results now?  I hope so.  Vote and then hit like.  Let me think.  When do you listen to the O&A show?  This is just how am I supposed to now even concentrate on the rest of the show or the day or anything with this question on my mind.  Well, when we're doing the show, I guess I listen part of the time.  So I'm listening then. 
[02:36:00]  I can say I probably listen to the show most of the time.  I've probably heard every show that we've ever done because I'm here listening to it.  I'd have laughed, but there are times I listen to the show when we replay it.  Yeah.  And I'm like, wow, that happened today?  Really?  Yeah.  No idea.  Well, because there's so much going on.  And we'll go off on something and I'm looking at phones to see where we're going to go next there.  And I'm getting communiques. 
[02:36:30]  I'm looking at the instant feedback.  Next thing I know.  Instant feedback, yeah.  We're on to another subject that I had no idea he discussed.  I don't know.  Clockwork Orange or something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, that's from doing it for so long that it's natural on the air or off the air.  Right.  But I notice a grim silence when you guys go to a commercial.  You really have no relationship.  None of you three really ever talk to each other.  A grim silence.  You know what that is, though? 
[02:37:00]  It's everything we want to say to each other, we want to say on the air.  Why waste conversation that's not being heard, right?  Yeah.  I purposely try not to talk to these guys during the break.  That's weird.  That's strange.  But I mean, Ant and I will at least go, hey, you want to touch on whatever next?  We'll do that type of thing.  We'll actually talk because we might talk and it might be something really entertaining.  And then like, oh, fuck, man.  It should have been night.  Yeah.  Let's recreate that in three minutes and then it sucks.  It sucks.  You can't.  You can't.  We talk in the bathroom, though.  Yeah.  Like when we all three go to the bathroom, Jimmy will pull his pants down to his knees 
[02:37:30]  and take a leak like a five-year-old.  Yeah.  And yeah, we'll laugh and talk in there.  Wow.  But I guess we need to be in a bathroom.  Yeah.  Wow.  Rest stop.  All right.  I'm going to click when the show is live is when I listen to the ONA show.  Wow.  All right.  I'm going to submit.  And now you get a percentage.  Wow.  This is unbelievable.  When do you listen to the ONA show?  Here's the poll results.  When the show is live, 37% of the people answered with that. 
[02:38:00]  During the replay, 38% of you answered with that.  And I record and listen when I feel like it, only 25%.  But this is the sad part.  4,400 dummies actually answered that question.  Wait, wait, wait.  More people listen to the replay than when we're doing this live?  Yeah.  I totally believe that.  So can't we not do it live and just play the replay and sleep?  You have to record it at some point. 
[02:38:30]  Shit, you're right.  Thanks, Otto.  Thank God.  I like how Otto actually answered me.  That was good.  And how do you rate this vacation's worst of, it was good, has 39% of the vote.  All right.  Pest poll question number three.  This is from I'd like to listen.com.  Can we suck the client's dick any harder?  Jesus Christ.  Is that the question?  Oh.  It should be at this point. 
[02:39:00]  Who gives a shit?  Who makes up these questions?  And we love this.  Is it E-Rock?  We love the guys that are behind I'd like to listen.com, but we've really got to figure  this out better.  All right.  The third question.  How is Dave from New Jersey doing with all the show parodies?  Whoa.  Whoa.  What is his latest parody again?  The Club Soda Candy? 
[02:39:30]  We can't play that because he's not here.  You know, I love his stuff, right?  I love his songs and stuff.  But really, are a lot of people going to know that it's him and which parodies he does?  And at this point, early in his career here, like this.  What's the name of this one?  Sicking the Pests on You.  Sicking the Pests on You.  This is Dave from New Jersey.  So now I'm sicking the pests, the pests, the pests, the pests on you.  Oh, yes, you're going to regret what all the pests will do to you. 
[02:40:00]  You've made a real big mistake.  It's real, the pain you feel.  Quickly, you'll be suppressed.  And they will not ever rest.  Until the pests, the pests get you.  O-N-A.  O-N-A.  Always win. 
[02:40:30]  All right, that's his latest creation, Dave from New Jersey.  That's pretty good.  He's got a really good voice.  He really does.  So how is Dave from New Jersey doing with all the show parodies?  Anthony, every single one is a gem.  They're so-so.  They're disturbing.  I haven't heard one of them yet.  Just put down, I haven't heard one of them yet.  Even though I just heard one.  I'm going to fuck with this whole survey. 
[02:41:00]  Wow.  Every single one is a gem.  44% of the people answered with that.  They're so-so.  26%.  They're disturbing.  4%.  And I haven't heard one of them yet, 27%.  I just kicked that up a little bit.  So there you go.  I like to listen.com.  Who is your favorite O-N-A show character whose name starts with E?  Is that going to be one?  Probably.  You update the question.  Elo.  Elo. 
[02:41:30]  E-Rock, you update the question.  E-Danny.  Once every what, two weeks?  No.  All right.  Is the sponsor happy now?  Yeah.  Ugh.  Especially when we send them that air check.  Yeah.  They're going to love that one.  Hey, let's pop this in and give it a listen.  This is the latest air check on our spots that they're doing.  Right.  Over there on Opie and Anthony's show.  What do we play for you?  Your best plug for our company.  All right.  Let's move on here and say hi to Jeff in Ohio. 
[02:42:00]  Jeff.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Hey, Jeff.  Jeff.  You know, I got my XM satellite radio three months ago, and it's been the best three months  of my life changing the way I listen to radio and listen to you guys.  Yeah.  How did you get turned on to the Opie and Anthony show?  You know, I might have wanted to hear that.  I'm thinking in my head, all right, a friend.  Is he going to say a friend?  Is he going to say he heard us? 
[02:42:30]  He used to listen when he was in New York years ago.  Like, all these things ran through my head, and I'm waiting for an answer, and Opie hangs  up on him.  Joe, North Carolina.  I'm better than the answer, by the way.  Tropical Storm Ernesto is coming your way, by the way.  Yeah, fuck it.  I don't care.  Trying to keep it local for you.  I appreciate that, but just wanted to say, guys, I've been a fan of York since NEW, the  two holidays on XM.  This Letterman thing is what we've all been waiting for.  We know you guys deserve it.  Congratulations, and good luck. 
[02:43:00]  Oh, my God.  I'm getting teary-eyed.  I know.  Thank you.  Hey, you know what?  Seriously, that's all I got, guys.  Fuck it out.  That's all you need.  You know the only reason we're on Letterman is because, you know, we have the same bosses,  right?  Shh.  No.  It's because we're somebodies.  Actually, Leno's people called.  Shh.  All this.  What?  Shh.  Wait till we're done.  What?  Wait till we're done.  What?  What happened?  This afternoon. 
[02:43:30]  What?  What?  What happened?  Taping, and then you can talk about whatever you want.  Come on.  Whatever.  Who called?  Who this?  What bad?  It's just keep the karma good.  You're entertaining guys.  That's why you're on, you know?  Thank you.  A lot of people work for CBS that aren't on the Letterman show.  Tom Chiasano's not going to be on.  He's a boring guy in a suit, you know?  Yeah, see?  Yeah.  Good point.  Good point.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I just want to write this.  Let me see. 
[02:44:00]  Two.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Still?  Yeah.  Has there been any, like...  I better destroy this community.  Yeah.  Rip that.  Shred that immediately.  All right.  Run it through a triple crush shredder.  All right.  Let's say hi to Jerry in Philly.  Jerry, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  Hey.  I thought on Rich Voss' show was really funny yesterday.  Oh, how was that disaster?  Rich Voss and Bonnie took over the airwaves yesterday after we left for about, what, 45 
[02:44:30]  minutes or so?  I heard they went at it.  Did they?  You just listened to them.  Like sex or a fight?  Wait a minute.  Get on mic.  What?  Not only is that guy really funny, but his diction or his mockery of diction, some  of the shit he was saying was just unbelievable from the stuff that was coming  out of his mouth.  Where did he grow up?  Like, where did he learn to talk like that?  I heard there was some tension between the two.  Yeah?  Was it real or was it like, you know, Bonnie's delivery that she likes to do from time to  time?  No, it wasn't like full-blown. 
[02:45:00]  AIDS?  Yes.  What?  What are you?  They weren't really having at it, but just she was making fun of him for being a bore and  he was getting really annoyed with it.  Yeah, because he was really into doing this radio thing for 45 minutes.  Yeah.  You could tell by the way Jimmy was goofing on him about it.  He was kind of taking it seriously.  Like, hey, you know, I thought about this and, you know, you can't change the subject  on me now.  This is what I'm going to do.  And I guess then his wife saying that it was boring kind of got him pissed off.  Yeah.  He was talking about childhood development. 
[02:45:30]  Like, what the hell does he know about childhood development when you're five years old?  And then he went from that to how to quit smoking.  Well, he panicked and went into the addiction thing.  Yeah.  Otto, he wanted to do a show on comedy.  Yeah.  I heard that about his influences and, you know, the Rita Rudner clip.  Yeah.  He needed a Rita Rudner clip and an Alan King clip for his show.  What the hell are you going to do with that?  And talk about their influences and comedy and all that crap. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  He called Bonnie Benedict Arnold.  Did he really?  Yes.  Benedict.  I said, what's that?  Benedict Arnold.  I'll have to ex-Benedict.  So, was it good?  It was a weird.  I was laughing just from hearing that guy talk for a good 45 minutes.  It was just a riot.  Plus, you know, he's yelling at Bonnie, he's cursing at her, and she's cursing back at him.  I just thought it was the funniest shit.  Is she funny? 
[02:46:30]  I mean, I just...  Who?  Bonnie.  I mean, is she...  She's done well on our show.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  But they go at it.  When they're going at it, they're really funny together.  Mm-hmm.  All right, you guys.  All right, Jerry.  I feel the same way about, like, female comics.  Yeah, that's what I loved about the PNC.  It was a tuna-free show.  None of that fucking Margaret Cho bullshit.  You're not a fan of Margaret Cho there?  It really is a male art form.  I don't believe that there's any female comic from any era that could hold the jockstrap 
[02:47:00]  of the worst stand-up we have now.  It's a male art form.  I don't give a shit what they think of my opinion.  I've had a tough time with the female comics over the years.  Yeah, you just shut down.  I've tried to have an open mind, and I'm just like, man.  I just shut down.  I can't listen to what they're saying.  Oh, nothing worse than going to a show, and you're watching, you're laughing and everything,  and it's like, we'd like to bring out our next comedienne, and you're like, ah, here  it comes.  I know.  Here it comes, and then just nothing, a few little smatterings of applause. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  Just, they bring the whole show down.  They talk about their period, their overbearing mother.  Oh, my mother is still waiting for me to get married.  Girls, any of you?  Yeah.  Shut the fuck up.  I know.  There's stories about dating.  It's awful.  Yeah.  Oh.  I'm with you.  Yeah.  I know, guys.  They could be pretty selfish, girls.  Am I right?  Yeah.  Am I right?  Yeah, you're right.  Yeah, you're right.  You're right.  We're selfish.  Shut up.  All right.  We have a little audio clip here that's pretty good. 
[02:48:00]  This is different than the one we played yesterday?  That's what Sam says.  All right, Sam is giving us another clip of-  Oh, I like that.  Another clip of-  You're getting really good, Than, at passing the buck.  But he's like in charge now, so he has to be-  But it's good, like he did it very smoothly.  Is this different from yesterday?  Yeah, that's what Sam says.  But also it's potentially distributing kudos if it's a home run.  If it's a home run, yeah. 
[02:48:30]  Well, it's never presented that way, though.  You never go into it going, if this is good, it's going to be kudos.  You always go, if this is shit, it's on Sam.  Sam?  Yeah.  What do we got here?  Sammy.  George, if you want to make fun of Sam.  By all means, because we all have.  Oh, hello, my bloodless friend.  Yeah, we don't quite, don't-  Pigmentation, a loose leaf. 
[02:49:00]  We're calling him the whitest black guy.  Yeah, he's got the hair, but-  And then people on Whackbag did a Photoshop trying to find other white black guys, and  they don't come close to what we got.  Nah, they don't come close.  That word mulatto is now, like, politically incorrect.  Is there a better word for that now, a guy who's-  We can't even say mulatto anymore?  It's biracial now.  Biracial.  Biracial doesn't cover, that could be anything, Asian and friggin' Russian.  It doesn't narrow it down at all.  Eventually, we're going to communicate with just blinking our eyes. 
[02:49:30]  That way it's not-  Because, well, what's going to happen with the word biracial, it's going to be used like  we use mulatto, and then they're going to say biracial is no good at now.  But it covers too much shit.  Biracial is like Eskimo and Peruvian.  True.  That's biracial, too.  It doesn't mean black and white.  What do you call black and white?  I don't know.  You should.  Mulatto.  Mulatto.  Mongrel class.  This is a video clip that's up on opiananthony.com now. 
[02:50:00]  Okay.  It's just a kid who tries to jump some stairs on a skateboard, and he falls off.  He doesn't break anything.  He's not really hurt.  It looks like he just gets the wind knocked out of him.  Yeah.  And he makes a funny noise.  Okay.  Funny noise.  That's a funny noise.  Yeah.  That is the noise of losing your wind. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah.  That's you trying to breathe.  Good job, Than.  Good find.  Thank you.  Wow.  Whoa.  What do you got?  That's Bob Kelly.  Bob Kelly breaking his leg.  It does sound like that woman, too, that fell out of the grape stomping thing.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
[02:51:00]  And they're like, oh, oh, oh, gosh. 
[02:51:30]  Oh, I hope she's okay.  Oh, that had a hurt.  Oh, oh.  Phony anchor people.  Yeah.  Like they give a shit about this woman that's doing a grape stomping story.  All right, Sam.  Thank you.  I'll play your song as you leave.  My pleasure.  Sam's not black.  His ancestors, Thomas Jefferson.  He's not black.  He doesn't have big lips, just a real big thong. 
[02:52:00]  Well, his skin's kind of weird.  It's not black or white.  If he's white, then he's dark.  If he's black, he's light.  Who the hell can figure?  Who the hell can figure?  If Sam's white or a nigger.  White or a nigger.  Yeah, we're teasing, you know.  Because he's white with an afro.  Sam's not black.  He's not black.  Don't smoke crack. 
[02:52:30]  He ain't black.  There you go, Sam.  That was good.  Who we finally hired.  He makes money now.  Congratulations, Sam.  That's great.  He hung in there for like, I don't know, a year and a half, I think it was, right?  He's got a job now?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Then he's white.  Well, but we're paying him like he's black.  So there you go.  We still don't know.  He's the low man on the scrotum pole, though, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're like, you're a low guy.  Him and Bill.  Who was low guy before him? 
[02:53:00]  Travis?  So Travis has moved up.  Travis moved up.  Damn.  I love this.  When someone gets fired or leaves, everyone just kind of...  Is there any animosity or anything that Derek pretty much got passed over by Than?  Derek is his own entity.  He's like the only one that does what he does, I guess.  Whatever that is.  Spell things improperly on the path data.  I don't think Derek...  Like, I would be...  If I was Derek, I'd be like a little fucking Than, man.  You passed me over.  I'm smart. 
[02:53:30]  I'm smart.  Derek does have the full Grape Lady clip.  Let's hear that.  Well, I mean, we're playing this just to hear the dumb news anchors, because we've heard  the clip a million times.  I like the setup, too.  The setup's good?  The bad music, how happy they are, and how it ends in just tragedy.  It's one of the most famous, like, videos.  Fat load of shit falling out of a bunch of grapes on YouTube and every other video freaking  website.  But we just love the setup.  She's stomping the grapes for some dumb lifestyle piece. 
[02:54:00]  And one of the things that's done is, right here, these buckets are filled with grapes.  What kind of grapes?  These are filled with Chamberson grapes, and the winner this Saturday, who stomps the  most juice, will actually win an overnight stay here at Chateau Alon.  You ready?  You ready to try it?  Yeah, sure.  Let's go.  I'm not disgusting.  Let's go.  All right.  You ready?  Give us a 30-second time.  Here we go.  So what's the deal here?  There's a contest to stomp, and how are you measuring who does the best stomping?  And whoever stomps the most juice wins an overnight stay, but it's not the only thing 
[02:54:30]  idiot actually tries to stomp out really quick at the end to win the contest, and that's  why she falls out of the fucking thing.  And what else do you have going on here?  Well, if grapes companies want your thing, you can come and spend the day listening to  live music, eating international foods, having wine tours and tasting, vineyard tours, seminars,  arts and crafts.  It's a lot of fun.  A whole day.  Stop.  Oh, stop.  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.  Oh, stop. 
[02:55:00]  Oh, stop.  The news anchors, though, I don't listen.  They're coming in in a second.  Stop.  Oh, stop.  Oh, no.  What a great baby here.  I think she's actually hurt.  No, I think she is.  Yeah, she's hurt.  She took a hard fall off there.  Okay.  Gosh, I hope she's okay.  Gosh.  Okay.  We're going to make sure she is.  Try and check on her and get back to you as soon as we can.  We'll be back right after this.  Oh, ow.  Oh, gosh.  I like the ouch.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Oh, gosh.  That had a hurt.  They don't know how to talk if they're not reading it off that dumb machine in front 
[02:55:30]  of them.  No, no, no.  All right.  Rich in Oklahoma.  What's up, Rich?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, how's it going?  Hey.  I was just going to make a comment about Rich and Botch yesterday.  The whole show was not funny at all.  Until the very, very last word, and it was from Fonny.  It was the funniest line ever.  The boss asked her if there was anything she wanted to plug, and she cut her butt. 
[02:56:00]  Oklahoma, where the mailman shoots you in the face.  Thank you.  Paul the trucker.  Hi there, boys.  Hey.  Hey, listen.  Boss did a pretty decent job yesterday.  People don't give him enough credit.  They're calling in.  They're busting his ass.  They're trying to get him riled up.  And he called, he called Bonnie, um, Bennett, what the hell was it? 
[02:56:30]  Not Benedict, not Benedict, benediction.  Yeah, we already told everyone that.  Yeah, it was Benedict Arnold, or, oh my God, the callers just suck ass.  All right.  We got, um, we got the CNN audio.  This thing is just great.  The Kyra Phillips, have you heard this there, uh?  Uh, no, no.  What's this guy?  Well, what's the story there, Than?  Uh.  She went to the bathroom.  She had her mic.  This is just a great one. 
[02:57:00]  Had her mic on.  Right.  Yeah, um, yeah, that's pretty much it.  During some, uh, Bush speech.  You know, these anchors sit there, or they sit at the, uh, desk, and when Bush is talking,  they don't just sit there listening to the whole thing.  They're fucking puppets, uh, that read a teleprompter.  So, uh, they know they have time to go to the bathroom.  They go back, come back, and during the middle of Bush's speech, then they'll say, like,  we're listening to George Bush deliver a speech, but, but they're not sitting there the whole  time listening.  Yeah, yeah.  So, this woman gets up to go to the bathroom, and, uh, left her mic on. 
[02:57:30]  I guess the control room, really, should have been responsible for that.  Left her mic on.  And you hear her chit-chatting in the can with some other broad.  Yeah, Kyra Phillips.  Assholes, yeah, I'm very lucky in that regard with my husband.  My husband is handsome, and he is genuinely a loving, you know, no ego, unintelligible,  you know what I'm, I'm saying, just a really passionate, compassionate, great, great human  being, and they exist, they do exist, they're hard to find, yup, but they are out there. 
[02:58:00]  You do, unidentified woman, because just in case you can't understand what's going on.  Uh, we'll see.  He's going to come, you know, he's set for an extended visit, unintelligible.  This is from CNN, while, while we were supposed to be watching the, the Bush, uh, speech there.  Uh, Kyra Phillips.  I mean, that, that, that's how you figured all out, those extended visits.  Yeah, by sucking his big fat cock.  Oh, that isn't said. 
[02:58:30]  Yeah, but my mom, I think she really likes him.  Mom's got a good vibe?  Good.  Yeah, my brother's the one that, unintelligible.  Uh, that thinks he's an asshole, obviously, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Uh, Phil's brother, of course.  Those bros have to be, you know, protective.  Except for mine, I've got to be protective of him.  Unintelligible.  Yeah, he's married three kids, but his wife is just a control freak.  Oh, boy.  Oh, there you go.  So now she's talking about her, her sister-in-law?  Uh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  And then the woman says, Kyra? 
[02:59:00]  Yeah, baby?  And then...  Your mic is on, turn it off.  It's been on the air.  And here's how it went down on CNN.  Every department of my administration...  ...response to the last two surrogates.  I'm very lucky now.  He has recommended practical reforms, things to do to make sure that the response is better.  You know, no ego...  Chertoff, Secretary Chertoff has increased millions...  You know what I'm saying?  Just a really passionate, compassionate, great, great human being.  And they exist. 
[02:59:30]  They do exist.  They're hard to find.  Yep.  But they are out there.  ...to feed up to a million people for about a week.  We looked at what went right, and we looked at what went wrong, and we're addressing that  which went wrong.  I mean, that's how you figure it all out.  In Indiana, we have pre-positioned supplies and...  The people of the Gulf Coast...  Mom, is that a good vibe?  ...at the federal level, and at the state level, and at the local level, we've all assessed...  Of course, brothers have to be protected. 
[03:00:00]  And we're now working together in better fashion.  Except for mine.  We're better prepared.  I've got to be protective of him.  The step one of rebuilding is to assure people if another hurricane comes...  He's married three kids, but his wife is just a controlled freak.  Yeah, but we...  Make sure that...  Make sure that people...  All right, we've been listening in to President Bush as he speaks in New Orleans today.  This is the one-year anniversary between the making land shore there.  President Bush saying if another national disaster hits our country, we must react better than that. 
[03:00:30]  We've got to do better than that.  Friday, wide, open wide Friday, wide opening.  Do these people get fired immediately when they fuck up like that?  Somebody had to get thrown out the door for that one.  Yeah, you've got to fire them.  Some little fucker in the control room is just gone.  Isn't that great?  All right, let's say hi to Twinkie here. 
[03:01:00]  Twinkie, what's up?  What's up, man?  Boys, I'm on my way down from Maine with 8,000 Twinkies for the Letterman Drive-In Show.  When are you going to be here?  Uh, I'm looking to be there by two.  Are you on the road already?  I'm arriving right now.  Well, where are you right now with the 8,000 Twinkies?  I am just getting ready to come in outside skirts of Boston.  Well, you better hurry up.  Hey, I'm a truck driver.  I can handle this.  All right.  All right, cool.  Breathing heavy.  And you're going to hand out the Twinkies outside the theater there? 
[03:01:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  8,000 Twinkies.  Nobody believed me on PalTalk yesterday, but 8,000 Twinkies.  I got eight cases, 100 boxes in a case, and Twinkies per box.  You're just going to open it up on the street?  What do the Twinkies represent?  That's my name on PalTalk.  I got connections to Twinkies, so I figured, what the hell, I'll bring 8,000.  I got what I got.  I think the connection is the fact that our listeners are all fat. 
[03:02:00]  That's what Twinkie is saying?  Is that what you're saying, Twinkie?  No, I'm not saying that, because I'm not fat.  That's the thing, you know?  Right, right.  I'm a truck driver.  That's very cool.  I hope we get a nice crowd outside the theater, and now they get Twinkies.  I think you will.  I think it's going to be big.  All right.  Well, we'll see what you guys are capable of.  Do we have the standby number?  That's still...  Yeah, 2-1-2-2-4-7-6-4-9-7.  It's on your pad data.  Oh, it is. 
[03:02:30]  The pad data.  Very good.  All right, Twinkie, thank you.  We'll see you in New York.  Peace.  All right.  Hey, what was that clip you guys showed where you were like shoe salesmen?  It was at the PNC, and it's something about a girl's fat asses.  Did you like it?  Oh, yeah.  I thought it was great.  I see a movie coming for you guys.  Oh, really?  No, really.  I mean, not like the Howard Stern movie, but some kind of a teenage romp.  You know, I absolutely see that.  Shit like that.  Do we look like teenagers?  No.  I mean, I'm gratuitous.  No, we're assaulting them. 
[03:03:00]  No, a gratuitous Bill Murray type of movie for you guys.  I mean, absolutely.  Well, let's just do good on Letterman tonight, and then we'll...  This is huge.  And then we'll start taking meetings in Hollywood, blow off the radio show, and that easy life  in Hollywood.  That was our commercial.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was our TV commercial.  That was great.  I liked the way that was done.  It was really good.  Didn't it look good?  Yeah.  The whole look of the commercial was good.  Oh, it looked very crisp.  It looked beautiful.  Yeah.  The commercial's up on YouTube.  Is it?  Oh, man.  Just hoping Anthony in the search engine.  That was great.  But the version you saw, which got a huge laugh from the 12,000 plus people at the PNC, 
[03:03:30]  will not be shown on TV.  No?  Because the word ass was used.  Come on.  I hear that all the time.  That's ridiculous.  At least not on CBS or any of the networks.  So we had to go with the other take, which isn't as funny because you're not saying that  she has a huge ass.  What is the other line?  Something like, it was, what did I say?  But, can I send you to a nutritionist?  That's horrible.  No, it's not the dress.  Yeah.  It's so much better saying it's your huge ass that makes you look fat or makes you fat 
[03:04:00]  or whatever.  I'll kind of listen and go, it's not the dress.  I mean, it works, but it would have been much better with the ass line.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, the ass line, you know, hits them between the eyes.  Yeah.  But now that's being downloaded like crazy on YouTube.  And you know what?  It's kind of funny because the commercial hasn't aired yet.  Yeah.  Yeah, so who knows?  We think they might have just made the commercial for YouTube.  Yeah, of course.  That's what we're thinking.  Yeah, I know.  I haven't heard anyone that's seen it.  I haven't seen it. 
[03:04:30]  The fuck?  They spent all kinds of money on that thing.  That thing was like, we were there for hours with a huge film crew.  Yeah.  And it was done on film and lighting people.  It took forever to make.  What's cool is XM just emailed us this morning.  Oh, what?  They're going to do an O.P. and Anthony commercial.  Oh, good.  Really?  Okay.  Another flash animation.  No, no.  They said it's our commercial.  Live action O.P. and Anthony XM commercial.  Really?  For the fourth quarter.  National spot.  Let's say hi to John in Indiana. 
[03:05:00]  John?  Hey, boys.  Boys, what's up?  Hey, John.  Hey, boss and Bonnie Lag yesterday were just killer, man.  But listen, I told him I really didn't need to talk to y'all, but just the chick, the  noose chick falling off the stage or whatever it was, I just caught the tail end of that  a minute ago, and it's hilarious.  You've never seen that video clip?  No, I haven't.  No, I drive a truck myself for me and the better half here, worst half, whatever you  want to call it.  See, I'll never, I'll never, I honestly will never figure out this radio thing completely  because I'm thinking, why are we playing this again? 
[03:05:30]  Everybody has heard this clip.  Yep.  Yeah.  Everybody has had to hear this clip by now.  I don't know.  I just, well, I heard the majority of it when you played it there just a little bit ago,  and it's just, I believe I've heard it once before, and it's just hilarious.  Man, it's funny.  She sounds like a beagle.  Yeah.  Well, she, she got the wind knocked out of her.  That's what it is, man.  Do you ever do that in school, like, fall back or jump or swing, and, you know, like,  flat on your back, and you just can't breathe.  Knock the wind out of you.  What is worse?  What is worse for guys?  We'll, we'll end with this today, because we have to leave early. 
[03:06:00]  We got, like, a pre-interview, and we gotta, we gotta get our nerves in order.  Yeah, that's how y'all do that.  Getting hit in the balls or losing your wind?  Oh, the balls.  The balls.  I don't know, man.  That wind thing, though, is pretty, pretty desperate, too.  I gotta disagree, man.  I gotta still get the wind knocked out of you, see, because I'm married.  Dude, that pain.  Hold on.  That creeps up on you.  You guys are too quick.  Think about it.  Have you had the wind knocked out of you?  That's scary, but it's not painful.  Where you're just gasping, and you can't get your breathing back?  Yeah, but I don't know.  Or that pain of getting kicked in the nuts. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, the gonads are definitely.  Yeah.  I've never gotten a full kick to the nuts.  I just had a brush against it, and it was horrible.  It's all it takes.  Yeah.  You know what used to happen all the time when I used to work for a living?  Winding up an extension cord on the job site, and you're winding the cord around your arm,  and the receptacle end just flips up and fucking, like, clock your right nut.  Yeah.  Just bam.  Direct shot.  Double over, right?  Fuck!  And you wait for it. 
[03:07:00]  That's okay.  Go ahead.  You tell the story.  I'm just trying here, but go ahead.  You do it.  I got it on my hold.  I'm sorry.  But you get that pain from a part of your body you didn't even know exists.  It's, like, so deep in.  Your actual ball doesn't hurt.  No.  It's your lower abdomen on the side.  It's the organs.  It goes to your back.  It's the sickest, like, fucking pain.  It's the worst.  It's nauseating.  Yeah.  Imagine somebody's putting...  All right, hold on.  I like to listen dot com. 
[03:07:30]  There you go.  Oh, now there's a fucking question.  And we'll get the results.  What's worse?  And most guys would quickly say getting a kick to the nuts.  But think about when you had the wind knocked out of you.  Because that's pretty freaking scary and painful, too.  Yeah.  More scary than painful.  So you think, hands down, guys will say kick to the nuts.  All right.  Pain.  All right.  Is so bad.  And the worst thing is it takes a couple of seconds. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah.  Like you get hit, and you're thinking, hey, maybe I skated this one.  Oh, yeah.  And maybe it didn't really connect where it was supposed to.  I think I'm not really...  Oh, here it comes.  It's the guillotine drop.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And have that second...  Yeah.  Yeah.  It waits a little while, and then gets it.  Oh, God.  Here it comes.  All right.  What the fuck is that?  What the hell are you nuts connected to that does that?  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Andrew in Canada.  Andrew.  Hey, Opie Anthony.  Finally, I get to talk with you guys.  I just want to put a quick shout out.  You guys have made Canada unbelievable with your XM satellite radio. 
[03:08:30]  Thank you.  Do you know Darren Frost?  He's a Canadian comic.  Good friend of mine.  No, sir.  I'm sorry.  I don't.  No, okay.  We're trying to get a visit to Canada going.  But I guess it's like winter up there already, right?  Huh?  No.  You'll just let him talk, Opie.  Why not?  Why not?  You come to Canada, you stay at my house. 
[03:09:00]  Oh.  Honestly, you get the whole XM...  Is it a shack over a lake with a hole you fish through?  Fucking savages.  We're going to go ice fishing?  No, I got a 3,200 square foot house.  So, like, you can come...  Every Canadian has a 3,200 square foot house.  Yeah.  There's so much land up there.  Yeah.  And no one wants to live there.  So, if you do live up there, you get a big house.  Exactly.  But I just wanted to say, you guys are doing an excellent show because you probably don't 
[03:09:30]  even listen to my voicemails every single day.  Voicemails on what?  My God, he's a stalker.  Wait.  Where do you leave these voicemails?  On 1-866-WOW-WOW-WOW-WOW.  On your voicemail.  Hi.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony show.  That voicemail.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I check those every day.  Yeah.  Yep.  Right at 11 o'clock, we all huddle into a room and see what wisdom we get from our listeners.  The people in my office hate me for the fact that I listen to Opie and Anthony all day and 
[03:10:00]  they just get pissed off and say, well, can't you listen to something else?  I went, no, it's my XM unit, so piss off.  All right on.  That's cool.  We're going to get up to Canada.  We're going to have to wait now to the spring, I guess.  What?  Until the spring fog goes off of the lake?  Yeah, man.  Winter is hitting up there any day now.  Yeah.  Not even close.  I'm still in short sleeve and a t-shirt right now. 
[03:10:30]  Andrew, I lived in Buffalo, which is close enough.  Yeah.  You are close to winter, my friend.  All right.  But I just want to say thank you very much, guys.  You guys are doing an excellent job up here in Canada on 202.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Bye now.  You don't care about these people.  No, we do.  We actually do.  They know we do.  Pot's almost decriminalized in Canada.  They're pretty hip up there. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah, they're almost legalizing it up there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's probably part of their socialized medicine or something.  Well, they're just trying to keep people living in Canada.  Oh, the new poll is up.  That was fast.  Yeah, but the other two crappy questions are still up there.  Which is worse?  Got to replace them slowly.  Getting kicked in the balls or getting the wind knocked out of you?  And I'll vote for you.  Which one are you going with?  Balls.  All right.  Balls.  Vote for me properly.  I did.  All right. 
[03:11:30]  Okay.  16 votes in.  Getting kicked in the balls, 50%.  Getting the wind knocked out of you, 50%.  Wow.  Otto?  Getting kicked in the balls or getting the wind knocked out of you?  Me?  I already voted balls.  Well, no, you didn't vote.  I'm voting for you.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Getting kicked in the balls, 63%.  Getting the wind knocked out of you, 37%.  Wow.  That changes quickly.  Well, a lot of people are doing it.  Has Than voted?  All right.  Than? 
[03:12:00]  Balls.  Balls for Than.  All right.  That went too fast.  I didn't get to change the poll, but your vote is in.  Travis?  No.  He's got to go.  No.  The ovaries?  That's why.  All right.  I'll vote for Travis.  That has to be getting the wind knocked out of you.  All right.  For Travis.  Wow.  92 votes in.  There you go.  They're voting.  All right.  Steve.  Yeah.  Getting kicked in the balls or getting the wind knocked out of you? 
[03:12:30]  Balls.  Yeah.  No doubt.  Have you ever had the wind knocked out of you?  Steve goes for the balls.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  All right.  That's how we end today, I guess.  We got to go.  Wow.  That was quick today.  Yeah.  We do have to go.  But we're still working.  I know.  We have things to do.  It's very busy.  We're doing a pre-interview from 1030 to 1130, and then we're going to be over at the Letterman  Theater, anywhere from 3 to 4.  I think we're showing up, maybe.  We have time for a nap? 
[03:13:00]  We're going to try to nap together.  Don't steal the covers.  It's going to be great.  I mean, it's going to be a short moment in time, and then you're going to have so much  to talk about tomorrow, and it's just going to be great.  And then, you know, you won't be as nervous next time if you're nervous at all this time.  You're a mouth to God's ears.  Yeah.  It's going to be good.  I did Joe Franklin.  I know big-time show business.  Yeah.  We did Donnie Deutch, so let me tell you.  They never aired it, and they've been trying to get us back ever since. 
[03:13:30]  I'm like, no.  John McEnroe show.  We did John McEnroe's show right before he got canceled, but that was like not doing  TV.  It's important that people see you, though, you know?  I mean, be real.  Well, yeah, that's what we were thinking when John McEnroe's people called us.  Yeah.  You know that not one person the next day called our show and commented on our John McEnroe  appearance?  Nobody watches that.  I swear to God, no one.  I don't even know if the video clip's available.  Hasn't been on for years now.  Because I don't even remember.  Well, that was like two years ago.  I don't even remember what we did on that show or anything. 
[03:14:00]  Wow.  So I went to YouTube thinking that might be up there, because like you said this morning,  everything's on YouTube.  Everything's going to end up on YouTube.  Not our appearance on the John McEnroe show.  That'll end up there.  All right.  Otto, what are we promoting today?  Oh, the usual shit.  I'll be at the brokerage next Wednesday with Joe Conti, my dear friend out there, Joe Conti  and Chips Cooney at the brokerage next Wednesday.  Basically, go to your MySpace account, because you've got a lot of gigs.  The next one is September 8th at Gotham.  The Gotham.  Yeah, we're trying to get a lot of O&A fans down for that, because the crowds in Manhattan 
[03:14:30]  are really snotty, and I'm stuck up.  And I want some of those cops and truck drivers and the O&A people.  I want some real people there.  Guys that appreciate humor.  Yeah, definitely.  Sticks in the mud.  The blue collar people.  Good people.  Hold on a minute.  We got another poll question up.  All right.  Thanks, man.  I'd like to listen.com.  What is a worst catchphrase?  Friday wide. 
[03:15:00]  Friday wide or no sleeves.  What's the no sleeves from?  Am I...  That's my...  Nobody else remembers my bomb from yesterday.  Remember his bomb?  Yeah, he bombed yesterday.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  No sleeves.  Oh, because there was a defect in my Letterman outfit.  I got to say, why Friday?  Friday wide.  Friday wide.  Friday wide.  Yeah, but we need more choices.  Those are the only two.  Yeah.  That's it so far.  That was so horrific. 
[03:15:30]  All right.  So we go to Otto and George's MySpace account to find out where he's playing, and we're trying  to get him for the Cleveland O&A traveling virus.  Yeah.  Hopefully we'll have info on that very recently.  Is it just myspace.com slash Otto and George?  Yeah, that's it.  That'd be good.  That's easy.  All right.  I got a gig on the Cleveland date, but I'll cancel it as soon as you guys say you need  me.  Absolutely.  Yeah, man.  It's some stupid party.  It's no problem.  I'd love to be involved in that.  And I think the Cleveland show is going to be the last one for a little while.  Yeah. 
[03:16:00]  I'd love to do it.  I really would.  We're thinking about taking it indoors to a couple more cities, but we don't know.  So Cleveland might be it.  Yeah.  For a while, anyway.  All the info is up on opianathday.com.  That was a blast.  That was a great night.  Oh, hell yeah.  We wanted to get here for Philly.  We just have too many comedians.  Yeah, I heard.  And you don't want it to go overtime and stuff like that, right?  And we have like two extra comedians in Philly, right?  Yeah.  Dom Iwera, he's great, too.  And Jimmy Schubert.  That's cool.  He used to be a really good friend of the show.  We haven't talked to him in a while.  We have no beef with the guy, but we haven't seen him in a while.  He's really funny. 
[03:16:30]  Yeah, he's very busy.  So we got $10 lawn tickets.  Nice.  And that's for the candy show.  September 9th.  Do I wave in my left hand or my right?  And here they are.  Walk out.  Oh, man.  Don't wave.  All right.  I'm going to just walk up.  Don't wave.  Just walk out.  Oh, and let him...  Yeah.  How about I do this? 
[03:17:00]  No, don't do the shrug wave.  Halfway?  The humble, like, shrug wave.  Can I do the Jimmy wave?  Which one is that?  From JFK.  Where you wave gently with your ring finger.  Oh, okay.  You're an attractive man, Mr. Garrison.  Yeah.  I always use the middle finger.  Oh, okay.  It is the ring finger.  It is the ring finger.  Oh, the Tommy Lee Jones character?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, God.  Jimmy and I do that all.  They give a little wave like that.  Mickey Mallory.  You just got to walk out, and you got to look right at Dave, shake his hand, and take 
[03:17:30]  a seat.  And go, let's get this shit over with.  Come on.  Yeah.  Flaster a smile on your face and plow through this shit one more time, funny man.  Yeah.  All right.  It's the opposite of what I do when I'm a guest on your show.  You should just come in, be entertaining, and take over, make your point, and then get  out.  Whereas I just sit here like a boom and don't even know I'm on the air.  And waste my entire day when I could be recovering from my flu. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah.  I was under the weather today.  There's stupid rain from our PNC show.  Yeah.  You did fine today, though.  Thank you.  Absolutely.  We had a very busy show.  We had a lot going on.  That was cool.  All right, guys.  Thank you.  We'll see you tomorrow.  We'll have, I'm sure, a full report on our Letterman experience.  Oh, I'm sure we will.  We're pretty damn pumped, I got to tell you.  Everyone's going to be watching.  I'm excited for you.  And we'll see a lot of you guys outside the theater with the 8,000 Twinkies.  Yeah.  That's not our idea. 
[03:18:30]  But it'll be interesting.  You know how that's a tie-in to anything.  I'm supposed to get like $1,000 cash.  We got it?  Yeah.  Cool.  I don't have it in hand yet, but we'll have it.  All right.  Yeah.  I want to go have lunch on the street, so make it perfectly clear I don't have $1,000  cash on it.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, that'd be nice.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Yo, man, what time is it?  Right, exactly.  Yo, man, you got a cigarette?  Oh, yeah.  Boom.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Holy crap, look at my luck. 
[03:19:00]  Yeah.  Me getting my stupid like rap sandwich interview with Letterman will be how you got the big  black eye.  Yeah.  Hey, that's not a broken nose.  What, get in a big fight and just go out there with a huge black eye where he has to  talk about it?  Yeah.  Well, you got to get punched.  You want to punch each other in the face?  We could go in the office right now.  They do it in the movies all the time.  We'll just sit in a chair and you punch me in the eye and I'll like punch you in the  nose.  Yeah, we got to do something special.  They should have never told you you were doing Letterman. 
[03:19:30]  They should have just brought you over there.  You have too much time to fuck this up.  You're going to fuck it up.  I know.  We really do.  Yeah.  We really do have too much time to fuck this up.  You're right.  These asses at CBS.  Punching each other.  That's an idea.  It's like we'll just go out there beat up.  These asses at CBS told us about two months ago we're doing Letterman.  Yeah.  So it's been in the back of our head for two freaking months.  Yeah.  The vomiting and the nervousness.  Yeah.  But the day is here.  So we're going to enjoy it.  People could stop by XM for banners for outside Letterman. 
[03:20:00]  Hey, look at that.  E-Rock set that up.  Are you going to just sit out there on the sidewalk cutting up?  Oh, we have them all done.  Come on.  All right.  Cool.  Should E-Rock sit on the sidewalk to see new question?  Hmm.  All right.  We got to get out of here.  Yeah.  Let's go.  Anything?  No.  Of course.  No.  Of course not.  Nothing for air.  Nothing.  By hybrid.  Hmm.  What are you going to ask us?  Stuff for next week.  Like what?  It can't be.  This is what we have to do after this show.  We might as well do it for everybody.  All right.  Go ahead.  One of them I'll save. 
[03:20:30]  The FHM thing.  You want to do it Tuesday or Wednesday?  No.  Oh.  Otto, you want to do that with us?  Tuesday.  You want to do a...  Good luck tonight.  No.  We're still in the air.  You want to do the Tuesday?  We're doing our post-show meeting for you.  Oh, okay.  Do you want to be in a FHM photo shoot with us?  Do I?  And the rest of the comedian, friends of ours?  Yeah, I would.  They have like an idea.  Maybe I shouldn't say the idea?  No.  All right.  But it's us and our pals in comedy. 
[03:21:00]  Okay.  I would fucking love to.  Sure.  Yeah, it'd be fun.  One more?  Bring George.  Yeah, of course.  You want to do that Tuesday or Wednesday?  That's four hours.  Tuesday.  Tuesday?  All right.  We'll do a Tuesday.  Tuesday.  Why not?  Done.  We're off Monday, right?  Yeah, so we'll be well-rested.  Great.  All right.  What else, Steve?  We'll be exhausted again within hours.  We've got a contest starting Monday, but that's for CBS.  What is it?  Giving away computers.  Giving away the Macs. 
[03:21:30]  The iMacs?  Yeah, for production pieces.  Oh, the MacBook.  We're doing the production piece thing again?  We're doing the production piece thing.  But these guys will have more time?  They're going to have more time.  Remember all the bitching?  Certainly.  Yes.  So we're going to have more time.  Like we were taking care of people and stuff when the reality was we didn't get a lot  of good stuff?  I know, you bunch of dorks.  We'll have more info on that on Monday then.  More info on Monday, but we're going to have another production contest, and you guys will  have a lot more time to come up with stuff.  iMacs?  iMacs or MacBooks, actually.  MacBooks.  Nice.  Oh, that's what we were trying out the other day?  Yep.  Yeah, the MacBook is pretty cool. 
[03:22:00]  Definitely.  All right.  What else?  And something for Philly.  Something for Philly.  No, the mattress thing we took care of.  They wanted approval on a guest.  I'm not sure if we should talk about that.  The cheerleader?  Yeah.  Okay.  From what magazine?  Friday wide?  No.  I think she was.  Was it Maxim she was in or FHM or one of those magazines?  It's an Eagles cheerleader.  Right.  And they want us to talk to her.  Oh.  Wow.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, that's always great.  Good, good.  All right.  We'll think about that. 
[03:22:30]  And we're giving away a mattress down there?  Yeah.  Is it going to be a raffle?  That's what we're looking at, a raffle for a mattress from the Dial-A-Mattress people,  yeah?  All right.  Yeah, because we're asking everyone to show up outside WISP when we broadcast live a week  from tomorrow.  What else?  Ant, you want to read some copy?  What's it for?  An important client.  What client?  Write it down.  Why am I?  It's Ant's decision, but I'm going to read a copy. 
[03:23:00]  Which one?  This is how important it is.  Let me see.  Ew, I hate those guys.  Put it down.  Tell them.  Tell them.  Stupid camera.  To go fuck themselves.  Okay.  Dan's going to have a heart attack before the end of the year.  Good.  Yeah.  The kid needs to spice up a little bit.  Is that it?  Yeah, that was it.  All right.  Short list today.  Otto, thank you so much.  Thank you, Ope.  Thank you, Anthony.  Thank you for coming in.  You guys are terrific.  What are we doing until 12 now on this channel? 
[03:23:30]  What?  Oh, everyone's...  Oh, yeah.  Like, that's not you calling.  All right.  This is what they're requesting.  Toad the Trucker.  Yes.  Hey, I just want to request the Than and Sam show for the rest of the day.  Oh, really?  Do you guys have material?  Hey, Tracy Morgan never did a podcast.  Oh, do they ever?  Yeah.  These guys sit and rehearse.  Probably fell asleep.  Oh, you guys sit and rehearse at, like, lunch.  You guys sit and eat your lunch and talk about what was funny and what was not funny. 
[03:24:00]  Can we do, like, ooh, Steve.  I think it's cute.  No, it's not catty.  It's just cute.  These guys sit and go back and forth.  Really?  The Than and Sam show?  The Than and Sam show.  I love how the promo reads.  Than and Sam.  Than and Sam.  Than and Sam.  Well, we're putting together a demo.  We'd rather sort of premiere with that.  It's up to you guys.  Why don't you just play your demo on the air?  Well, it's not cut up fully yet, so.  Ah, all right.  I guess you're not getting the Than and Sam show today, Toad.  We could just use your guys' prep.  All right.  Good luck on Letterman. 
[03:24:30]  All right.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  We'll figure it out.  We got to go.  Thanks, guys.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Unpredictable.  Unleashed.  Unruly.  Unwashed.  Unkempt.  I stink.  Next thing I knew, I had my pants down around my knees and my shirt pulled up to my armpits.  Shut up!  Oh, who cares?  I can't believe you fell for that again.  Damn you, Hawk. </pre>
