<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts' characteristically vulgar banter, quickly transitioning into a discussion about new noise-canceling headphones, focusing on their uncomfortable fit and excessive bass.  Comedian Patrice O'Neal, a guest in the studio, then joined the conversation. The discussion shifted to a New York Post article about "hollabacknyc.com," a website where women post pictures of men who catcall them. This sparked a lengthy, often misogynistic and sexually explicit conversation involving O'Neal, Opie, Anthony, and several callers, exploring catcalling, relationship dynamics, and differing perspectives between men and women. O'Neal shared his cynical and often controversial views on dating and relationships, using numerous offensive jokes and anecdotes, including one about unknowingly interacting with a woman who had recently experienced a miscarriage. Opie mentioned closing on a new house and anticipated relationship problems with his girlfriend as a result.  A recurring theme throughout this lengthy discussion was O'Neal's detached and controlling approach to relationships. The segment ended with further discussion of O'Neal's views and the proposal of a spin-off show featuring his relationship advice.


Continuing with O'Neal as the central focus, the show moved into a segment heavily centered on relationship advice. Callers sought O'Neal's guidance on various relationship issues, including improving oral sex frequency, lack of intimacy, and infidelity.  O'Neal provided blunt, often sexually charged, and unconventional advice, using various analogies. The hosts also bantered with O'Neal, discussing his success on VH1's "Web Junk 20" and a workplace anecdote. A heated exchange occurred between O'Neal and a caller named Janet.  The show also included a discussion of American Idol, featuring the hosts' and O'Neal's opinions on contestants (particularly Clay Aiken and Ruben Studdard) and their dislike for Ryan Seacrest and Paula Abdul.  A significant portion involved callers seeking relationship advice. A technical difficulty with a song playing led to some good-natured ribbing of the sound engineer, E-Rock. The segment concluded with further discussion of O'Neal's potential relationship advice show, with potential names like "Black Dr. Phil" and "Bitch Management with Patrice O'Neal" being suggested.

The next segment began with a continuation of the American Idol discussion, focusing on perceived voting manipulation. This transitioned into a listener-submitted song based on a Patrice O'Neal story about a man hitting on him at a rest stop.  Big Kev, present in the studio, promoted his New York Comic Con appearance and discussed his weight loss surgery.  The show then featured "American Mess," an interview with Joey Mack, a self-described paranoid schizophrenic pizza delivery guy and musician.  Joey discussed his graphic and sexually explicit music and personal life, including a controversial incident involving his dog. His brother, Johnny, joined the conversation, addressing, albeit vaguely, accusations of molestation. Joey Mack's music was played again before the end of this segment.

A caller, Joey, and his brother, John, then engaged in a highly graphic discussion detailing past sexual abuse, including incest and bestiality, using extremely offensive language. Opie and Anthony guided them through a conversation towards forgiveness and reconciliation, punctuated by a crude running gag involving scissors and the brothers' implied horniness. The show shifted to a discussion of Patrice O'Neal's potential nudity on Paltalk, with Anthony demonstrating his power to ban users and describing explicit sexual content seen on the platform. O'Neal joined the conversation, promising to appear on Paltalk with his girlfriend.  A news story about a figure skater's fall at the Olympics, featuring a photograph interpreted as showing a sanitary pad in the Daily News, led to a raunchy discussion about menstruation.  A controversy around a store advertising undershirts as "wife beaters" sparked a debate about offensive language and corporate responses to public outrage.  A caller, Mike, came into the studio with gifts for the hosts: a burlap sack, a stun gun, and hand sanitizer. The segment ended with further discussion about corporate reactions to controversies.

In the final segment, the conversation briefly revisited the burlap sack and a fictional cyanide scenario. O'Neal promoted his upcoming stand-up performances at Caroline's Comedy Club and mentioned his upcoming relationship talk show on XM.  The hosts thanked O'Neal, concluding the broadcast with further profanity-laced banter.

[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  This is our resistance.  Dude.  The onslaught of the communist masters of deceit.  We're a bunch of scumbags.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Jackass.  And yeah, we're back.  Where have you been?  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  A bunch of idiots.  Perversion for profit.  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  The O.P.  The O.P.  The Anthony program.  The O.P.  And Anthony.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bat to my brain. 
[00:04:00]  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  O.P.  I want my coffee.  I want my coffee.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that fact.  Jim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down syndrome children.  No, baby.  It's terrible.  The O.P.  And Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:04:30]  It stinks and I don't like it.  Hello, exactly.  Oh, Anthony.  This is a giant cock.  Oh, come on.  Pardon my French, but you're an asshole.  No, no.  It's not funny.  Oh, come on, stop.  Asshole.  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  No, come on.  Will you just mind your peace and peace, buster?  And remember who you're dealing with. 
[00:05:00]  Uh-huh.  What we're dealing with here is a complete lack of respect for the law.  Anthony, I don't think you really mean that.  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Oh, Anthony.  God, why don't you put so many jerks in the world at the same time?  Oh, you know you're going to go to hell for this.  I'm going to kiss you on the mouth. 
[00:05:30]  Do you want to kiss me?  What a fucking idiot.  Good morning.  Wow.  Was that you just saying good morning?  Yes.  I thought it was coming from another galaxy.  I told you.  Mars came running into our office before the show all excited. 
[00:06:00]  He said that he has brand new headphones for everybody.  New headphones.  Whoa.  New headphones.  I tried my new headphones and I said, eh, eh.  I'll tell you something.  And they make you look ridiculous.  Patrice O'Neill in studio.  His doesn't even fit his head.  These are huge.  I think, no, he's got the same old one.  Oh, it must be the hat or something.  You look weird today.  I don't know what it is.  You look like you should be in Run DMC. 
[00:06:30]  My head just grew.  What do you think, Anthony, of the new headphones?  What's this?  I have no idea.  Volume adjust?  Volume control.  Oh.  They're noise reduction headphones.  I guess if you're in a band or something, you know, and you don't want to hear everybody  else playing around you, like if you're the drummer or something, you throw these headphones  on and it takes the noise out of the room.  Yeah.  But they're really tight on your head.  You know what it is more than being tight on the head?  They're so bassy. 
[00:07:00]  Like, this is really weird.  I got this deep voice.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Yeah.  I'm changing out.  Yeah.  I mean, they're not, I could see them being good under certain circumstances.  I think voiceover recording, this would be very good.  But for having five or so other people talking and hearing them through these, it's a little  odd.  It feels like there's like a clamp on your head.  And when you're doing a radio show where you got to move around a lot and.  You motherfucker, you made me pop your fucking eyeball out. 
[00:07:30]  Right.  Like, can you have like a psychological, imagine if you started with those and then you would  introduce the ones you have on now, the new ones.  Right.  You'd be like, fuck these ones I got on.  Radio guys.  Give them a shot.  Radio guys are very strange, Patrice.  Ah, there we go.  Now I feel better.  I had the same headphones for over 10 years.  I used to duct tape them together.  We had an engineer at the old place and he would have to like wire my headphones on a weekly 
[00:08:00]  basis because the things were falling apart.  Yeah, because you just get, you get comfortable with them.  Yeah.  All right.  I mean, those, those new headphones, they're just not going to get the job done.  All right.  No, no, no.  All right.  Let's say hi to Nina on Long Island.  Nina.  Hi.  Hi, Nina.  Hi, Nina.  Hi, Patrice.  I love WebJunk 20.  Thank you.  Oh, there you go.  I love Patrice when he's on The Office.  Yes.  As the warehouse worker guy.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  And you might know him from Arrested Development.  Yes. 
[00:08:30]  I always play just some big nigga with one line.  The prison guy.  Watch out, sucker.  Or you might know him from Head of State, a little Chris Rock movie.  Yes.  But no, I was asking Patrice this in The Office today.  It's all about WebJunk 20 when he walks around the streets in Manhattan.  Oh, my God.  It's little white girls and young thugs.  That's who knows.  Yeah.  Just the complete opposite.  Yo, son.  Young thugs.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  I think I'm getting ready.  Oh, yeah.  You see me in the cut, right?  Oh, shit.  I saw your HBO special.  Nope. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, shit.  You the web nigga.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  It's the WebJunk.  The little white girls get it exactly right.  It's WebJunk 20.  I love the dog that ate his own toe.  Oh, yeah.  Thank you.  Thank you.  What do you do?  You just go, yeah, thanks.  I go, thanks.  I go, thanks.  But, you know, not to be unappreciative.  It's like, whatever.  What the fuck are you going to do?  It's good for Patrice.  He's on one of those VH1 shows.  They show 20 times a day.  But if they come see my show, it's going to.  Don't bring your kid.  Like, it's not a teenager show I'm doing as a comic. 
[00:09:30]  He's so funny on VH1.  Let's bring the kids.  Oh, just horrified.  As I go, leave, bitches, and take your kids with you.  You, you, what'd you come with your family for, faggot?  So, Nina, what do you have today?  Well, I just wanted to say that I went to the restaurant the Saturday before the Blizzard,  and it was phenomenal.  FH Riley's?  Yes, I did.  Come on.  Tell everybody about it.  It was classy.  It was amazing.  The food was... 
[00:10:00]  Oh, Opie, what a time.  What a time for the phones to disconnect.  She's throwing a plug.  The food was what?  The phones just exploded.  I thought she was going to say phenomenal.  We really have to fix the phones.  Yeah.  Please.  Please.  Please.  She sounded good.  I wasn't even close to the mouse.  You know that.  They just exploded.  Please.  I was going...  Maybe Washington is sick of all the plugs from my brother's restaurant.  Oh, and they're cutting it off.  From now on, anyone gets through to plug that dumb restaurant, just blow up the phones for 
[00:10:30]  a couple seconds.  There's some kind of computer program they have that recognizes the word.  Right.  Riley's?  It's FH Riley's, 400 New York Avenue in the heart of Huntington.  You might want to go to dinner early, because on the weekends especially, the place is blowing  up.  Yeah.  It's getting a little out of hand.  Hey, can we have an opening day party, like a warming party for your new house?  No.  Can we all come over to you?  No one will be coming over to my new place.  I closed on my house yesterday. 
[00:11:00]  FH Riley and then over to Anthony's house to chill out and relax.  Yeah.  That's why I'm exhausted.  Nothing worse than sitting in...  You know my love of lawyers, right?  And just business and business people and meetings and conference rooms and paperwork  and everything I hate.  And I've talked about this on the show.  I hate all those things.  When we go to Washington and have to sit at a meeting, I stare at the floor and doze  off, because I can't be in those situations. 
[00:11:30]  And closings are full of that.  That's all it is.  Lawyers talking to each other, throwing numbers around, writing on paper with little calculators,  and then they trade the paper and the other lawyer, he types on his little calculator and  if there's a missing number, they talk to the mortgage person and the title guy is there  and things are being faxed and copied and you're signing 8 billion things. 
[00:12:00]  And then at the end, you get a key.  It's like at the end, you're handing over huge amounts of money, you get a key.  Did you see the picture in the house?  And they all shake your hands.  Yeah, it's beautiful.  Did you pick out which window they're going to crawl in when they break in and rape in  the girl?  Yeah, no kidding.  No kidding.  No one's getting in there.  I see what window.  I already cased the joint.  Patrice cased the joint through a picture.  Right there, that window right there. 
[00:12:30]  That window right there.  That's the one.  His eight-car garage and his fucking big giant door with no knob on it.  Boom, boom, boom.  Hello.  You ring.  He's going to have a goddamn butler.  And he's going to have to marry his girl because it's a fucking, it's not, you can rent a house  with a girlfriend.  You cannot buy a house and people come over and go, hey, how you doing?  This is my girlfriend up in the mansion.  This is my bitch.  She's, you're a deep shit now. 
[00:13:00]  You can't have an eight-room, an eight-bathroom house and this is my girl.  My girl.  What are you saying?  That's for like a bachelor pad or a...  Yeah, so imagine your friends come over and walk in that big, what I saw, that huge  40,000 feet windows and shit and you walk in and there's a woman in there and you want  to go, hi, are you the, are you the lady of the house?  Are you, are you the first lady?  No, I'm his bitch.  I'm walking around this fucking mansion. 
[00:13:30]  Because that's how a girl's going to be.  Your girl's mad cool, but she was cool because she was a renter.  How the fuck you going to buy a house?  My bitch, let me tell you, she's already planning, when I, when I like upgrade to a better apartment,  she's like, are you thinking about moving in by yourself?  It's like, um, yeah, but now you think your girl's going to be walking around in the master  bedroom and the fucking, your friends come over. 
[00:14:00]  It's called the master suite.  The master suite.  The master suite.  And she's your girl.  Watch what happens.  Watch what the fuck happens.  You should have rented for the rest of your life, asshole.  It's over.  All that, all that, I'm not getting married shit.  All your horse shit.  You're going to get married or she's going to leave you.  And he's not, he's not ready for her to just walk out, but I tell her to leave and I tell  you, I'll go bye, bitch, and hear the echo in my big house.  Bye, bitch, bitch, bitch. 
[00:14:30]  Shut the front door.  Take care.  I'm leaving.  And she has two, two fucking bags.  You know, you know, Patrice has a very interesting way to look at women.  Wow.  What were you saying in the, in the back office about your girl?  Like we were, we were talking about this, uh, thing in the post today.  Where is it?  Where is the thing?  Oh, fuck it.  And then you had a great angle on it.  And then we'll get back to Anthony's house. 
[00:15:00]  Uh, in the, in the New York post, they have this, uh, article in the pulse section called  photo site strikes back at cat callers.  And they got these girls that are maybe sixes.  Maybe.  Those two on the front.  Six?  Stop.  I wouldn't even put them over a four.  I'm being, I'm being nice.  Four down from a 10.  There's no way he sticks it.  The one looks like a young Melissa Etheridge with a short haircut.  She looks, she looks like Darren Etheridge.  Like Mike Etheridge.  She stinks.  These girls should be happy that there's guys cat calling. 
[00:15:30]  That's what the fuck.  My girl.  But hold on, hold on.  Let me just explain.  And then you can pop in there, Patrice.  So, uh, they're, they're striking back.  You know, uh, everyone has heard about, uh, women.  They walk around in New York city and, uh, construction workers are hubba hubba.  I think they say, man, they do just line up though.  It's hilarious.  They'll line up on fifth Avenue, you know, 20 in a row and just comment on every girl going  by.  Right.  So these, uh, these two, I guess, started a website to get back at the cat callers.  And what they do is they're encouraging women.  If you're getting cat called to take your cell phone and take a picture and then upload 
[00:16:00]  it to this website.  Not quite perverted justice here.  Uh, ladies, they're not quite really capturing.  I don't think this is going to jeopardize these guys' lives.  Here's the website before we give it out.  Cause it'll blow up.  If you want to check it out.  Let me take a look.  Let's see here.  Give it to, uh, the rock first.  Oh, so I could see it.  And then there you go.  All right.  And then like, if you're one of these woman, uh, women that, uh, got harassed, you take  the picture and then you could like comment about how it felt and what happened to you 
[00:16:30]  on the streets of New York.  And there's like, uh, here's a couple of the excerpts, uh, open letter to that asshole  on St. Mark's place.  If you're going to sexually harass someone, try not to do it while you're at work.  I think that the sock store deserves more attentive employees to the single white male.  You ladies look like you like to take advantage of a single white male.  Well, tonight, um, uh, can I take your picture instead?  I don't get that one.  Sorry.  I should have pre-read that one, but, uh, so there's a whole website. 
[00:17:00]  All right.  They're all slobs.  Oh my God.  All slobs.  Look at that awful crew of, this is what I'm saying, man.  The girls like this ruin it for like sexy girls who like, who enjoy that.  Some women have to enjoy that.  These monsters.  Why they got a picture of a guy with a cell phone?  He's pissed off.  Hey, why just, uh, does it just have to be the girl?  Are you fucking kidding me?  This guy looks like a fake.  Are they, but are they trying to be politically correct with their websites? 
[00:17:30]  No.  So they have a guy on there that's all also pissed off at the cat calling?  It's for pussies who are, who are, uh, condoning this.  Like they're trying to help them out.  Like if they see a chick who might not have a camera ready, he goes, Hey, I'll be your,  your Robin hood baby.  Right.  I'll be your, I'll help your Lance a lot.  Here's some black guy.  Uh, and he's, uh, just standing there.  I guess they got a picture of him.  The scene, uh, some girl, I guess is saying this me walking down Broadway between 178th and  179th street on a 60 degree day in February, enjoying my lunch break. 
[00:18:00]  Mr.  Man is heading my way with his buddy.  He gives me an exaggerated look up and down.  So Mr.  Man, that's what we're supposed to do.  Nature taught that.  They're hoping that these are guys with girlfriends too.  That's their whole point.  Single guys.  What difference does this make?  They want to get guys fired for like whatever.  And they want to get guys, they want to get guys divorced and all that.  Yeah.  It's in our nature to look at you ladies.  And the ladies are looking at us too. 
[00:18:30]  And I say the same thing to 75 bitches a day.  Hey, Hey, Hey Booger Bear.  I just say it.  It's a numbers game with us.  You got to.  Hey, sweetie cheeks.  Here's honey nipples.  Listen to this.  Here's the difference.  Uh, look how this scenario played out.  Uh, Mr.  Man, yo baby, you're gorgeous.  I want to hit that.  Hold on.  E-Rock will play the woman.  Cause it's, uh, it's, uh, it's a little dialogue that they, uh, got on the website.  All right.  You're playing the part of me. 
[00:19:00]  It says M E.  Uh, Mr.  Man.  Yo baby, you're gorgeous.  I want to hit that.  No, you're going to leave that out.  No.  Mmm.  Sir, can I take your picture?  Why do you want to take my picture?  Because I'm taking pictures of everyone who thinks I'm pretty today.  Girl, you could take my picture every day.  And then it says the weirdest part was as soon as I started talking to him, I could sense 
[00:19:30]  that he wasn't a kidnapper, rapist, or even really ass, a real asshole.  Uh, he was just a confused guy with absolutely no lady skills.  Uh, still, if I hadn't turned around for the hollaback, I would have walked on feeling  a little shaken and self-conscious.  How am I supposed to know which are the nice guys and which just don't get it?  Don't get what?  Hollaback one, Mr. Man zero.  Play better next time, Emily.  Hey, what's up, baby?  Can I finger pop you or rape you? 
[00:20:00]  One of the two?  But that's what you're going to get, is just guy commenting like that.  Well, hollaback New York City empowers New Yorkers to hollaback at street harassers.  This is the explanation of the website here.  Whether you're commuting, lunching, partying, dancing, walking, chilling, drinking, or sunning,  you have the right to feel safe, confident, and sexy without being the object of someone's  fantasy.  So stop walking on and hollaback.  Send us pics of street harassers.  You can't feel sexy unless somebody's harassing you. 
[00:20:30]  Women don't have to.  How can they feel?  They don't even know what they feel about themselves until we fucking let them know.  Here's what these guys are doing, too.  Look at all the pictures.  They're posing for the pictures.  The girls are saying, hey, can I take your picture?  And they go, yeah.  That's entrapment.  And they just take the picture, and they're smiling and having a good time, because guys  don't care.  See how little skills women need to have to do shit?  Even to set a guy up for their fucking website.  Like, guys, we would be thinking all kinds of amazing ways to take a picture of a bitch  that she don't know. 
[00:21:00]  Right.  You know, it's always going to be her looking in the skyline or fucking fixing this dress  or something.  But them.  Them and us, knowing how fucked.  This should tell you how stupid this website is.  It's about how easy we're fucking ready to be an asshole.  To take pictures.  Exactly.  To get a picture taken.  Did you see the one with the dirty old men?  Yes.  These fucking guys, they're way up there in years.  They just want to look at a piece of ass as they're walking down the sidewalk.  These are 70-year-old men with canes.  Walking down the sidewalk.  They look like they just got off a plane from London.  Yeah. 
[00:21:30]  That's how they're dressed.  They got that London look to them, and all they're doing is walking down the sidewalk  checking it out, right?  With canes.  And this chick, Asia, couldn't deal with it.  So she sent in this story in the picture.  As I'm walking down Broadway, the man on the left hisses, nice.  I ignore him.  When again I hear, nice, I turn around to see if this old dude actually has the nerve  to harass me.  He lifts his cane, points it up and down my body, and with raised eyebrows repeats, nice.  Sure wasn't Norton? 
[00:22:00]  He's like his line.  Nice.  For these two, wisdom doesn't come with age.  You gotta be joking me, man.  Something's gotta be done about that shit, man.  And there's their pictures.  Could you see going down the street?  I want a guy to walk down the street and walk up to a woman and go, hey, can I take your  picture?  They'd go, ah!  Exactly.  They'd be screaming, running away.  The amount of skill it doesn't take to have this website.  Because then they could do it to anybody.  See, this is the type of shit, but like I said, it's the thing that makes life even. 
[00:22:30]  It's like the fact that girls can just do this so easy.  Yeah.  She walks up the street and she could just not, you could look like a motherfucker that  took her purse six years ago and she just goes, can I take your picture?  Oh, okay.  And just make up a goofy little story.  You think this is all fucking legitimate?  You got it.  Can I take your picture?  Sure, baby.  Hey.  Did you get that or you needed another one?  Did the flash go off?  Now you're on the internet with, you know.  Yeah.  That's why I hardly ever try to put my face. 
[00:23:00]  Well, there's a lot of internet shit in me now.  Like I let fans take pictures and shit.  What are you going to do?  I guess it's different if you, whatever.  Yeah.  But on the street, dude, you know what I mean?  Some chick just decides to have that kind of control.  Snap a picture, you're on a website.  Yeah.  For saying hello or nice.  That's what we're supposed to say.  To slobby girls.  Look at the big fat one in the middle here.  That is, she's horrendous.  Who is she?  And it's a guy.  Who's the guy?  And they're all mad.  Yeah. 
[00:23:30]  They're all angry with their arms outstretched with the camera phone.  Fucking my girlfriend.  My girlfriend comes over to my house and there's a Puerto Rican dude that tries to, he damn  near tries to rape her every time she comes in the house.  And she comes, he's bothering me.  And I'm like, bitch, if the day he doesn't try to rape you when he comes to, is the day  I leave you.  So pull your bootstraps up, bitch.  This is what he's supposed to be doing.  I don't want my girl being safe.  Oh, shit.  Patrice just keeps his women in line, man. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, yeah.  Fucking even set up an obstacle course to make sure she's worthy.  Like, did he rape you?  Well, he's not going to rape you, but he's going to harass you, bitch.  You need to be harassed.  I don't want no harassless bitch in my life.  So this website has a lot of stories of guys that are just doing what guys are supposed  to do.  Yeah.  And these girls are not liking it and they're taking the pictures and sending them into this  website.  It's a numbers game, Obie.  I mean, not for you.  You know, you're in love and whatever. 
[00:24:30]  You know, you're fucking faithful.  But it's like, it's usually a numbers game.  To motherfuckers who out there getting girls, you know, you try to get as many.  We don't like quality.  We like quantity up until a point to you to you siphon through to the amount of women.  You find that one that you go, OK, this could be I can hang out with her.  I'll give her a little time and some some attention.  Right.  But other than that, man, if any woman out there meets a guy and he says, oh, I'm single.  He's not single.  He has at least 30 bitches that is around. 
[00:25:00]  Like if I told my girls, like, if you left me, I you it's the amount is amount of women  that you that you represent.  If my girl left me, I'd be hurt.  But I wouldn't be I wouldn't be totally out there.  What I would do is I would I think my girl in my life is worth five bitches now.  And if she left me, I'd take I'd take her spot with five bitches.  It don't matter who they are.  That's the exchange rate on your girl. 
[00:25:30]  That's the exchange rate on my girl.  She has built up to at least five women.  Wow.  Five.  And why does she why does she stay with you?  I'm a good man.  I'm a good man.  As much shit as I talk, I'm a good man.  But I don't I don't you know, we had a big argument the other day.  I was like, look, let's let's just break up for like a few weeks because she thinks she knows.  Look at you.  Wow.  Well, because she thinks she knows where the sky is now.  Like what women do is they get sick of you.  They got two halves of their brain.  They got one half that goes, you know, I love him so much.  Anthony's beautiful. 
[00:26:00]  And it's the other side that goes, fuck that nigga.  He ain't shit.  I'm a better motherfucker than him.  So there's always that war.  So basically, there's a time like I'm sure you tell your girl things like you.  She's younger than you.  So you there's things that, you know, like if you're if you're 12 years older than your  woman.  Right.  And you're trying to talk to her and she's like, I know, I know.  It's like, hold on, bitch.  So if you're 24 years old, can a 12 year old person say to you, I know, I know you're 12  years younger than me. 
[00:26:30]  If you're if you're 12 years younger than me, bitch, my girl is not that young.  She's like four years younger than me.  But I got four years more wisdom than her.  She's never been in a good relationship.  She's fucking goofy.  When is she going to?  She only thinks she knows shit because I tell her shit.  So now she thinks she knows shit.  Like, I know.  I know where the sky is.  I know how to walk now, motherfucker.  Who needs you?  I go, OK, sweetie, go out there and walk and find the sky without me.  Please do.  And then come back.  I'm not going nowhere. 
[00:27:00]  You might love you.  But I'm trying to teach you how to be liked.  Wow.  It's easy to love them.  It's hard to like them.  You are rough, man.  But I don't treat her like she gets treated very well.  I don't doubt that.  I don't doubt that at all.  I know how to be in a relationship.  But that being treated well is on such a fine line.  Like she could fall off of that being treated well.  Easy.  You let her be treated well.  You treat her well.  But it's a tightrope walk. 
[00:27:30]  Nah, she's not on eggshells, man.  Nah, she's just.  When you tell a bitch, why don't we break up?  You leave.  This ain't fucking bothering me.  You think you know it'll go see the world and come back.  I'd be crushed, but I'd be crushed in a reasonable sense.  I would have to take her place.  She has filled up my body five bitches worth.  Five bitches worth.  Yo, give me five bitches worth.  I'd trade her in.  Hot bitch from Whackbag. 
[00:28:00]  Patrice, you're such a fucking caveman.  Your poor girlfriend must have the worst self-esteem to be with your Fred Flintstone ass.  Wow.  Why is that Fred Flintstone?  Because, look, I'm telling you, Anthony, what's going to happen when you get this house.  Right.  She's going to want to marry you, and you're going to have to put yourself in a position to either take a loss or get married.  It's going to happen.  See, I don't see this coming.  You can't be a girlfriend in a mansion unless there's other girlfriends. 
[00:28:30]  See, you can't.  You either got to be married in a mansion or have 30 bitches walking around naked.  Like half.  You can't have one girlfriend in a mansion.  You can't do it, nigga.  I love his logic.  How the fuck are you going to have one girl walking around?  Hi, I'm your girlfriend.  Hi, Mr. Kumia.  I'm Mrs. Smith, your girlfriend in the master bedroom.  Because she's going to be in there, and she's going to be like, oh my God, this motherfucker can just throw me out.  So it's either a wife or a harem. 
[00:29:00]  A wife or a lot of hoes.  All right, listen, let's get back to the hollaback stuff.  Holy shit.  You are a pisser.  Let's get back to this website, because I think a lot of listeners want to comment and maybe post on this fine website.  Ah, yes.  Maybe show them what, well, maybe we shouldn't say that, but you can send whatever kind of picture you want.  How's that?  Hey, why not?  It's a free country, right?  If you've ever yelled out to a girl and been rude on the street, I think it's your responsibility to submit your own picture because you've been abusive like that to women on the street. 
[00:29:30]  And I think instead of waiting for a girl to take your picture, take the initiative, take some responsibility, and send your own picture in there.  And maybe they want to hear from the women that have no problem with this, by the way.  I mean, I know that Steve and Ben get a lot of pictures from our listeners.  Yes.  Especially at Jimmy's request.  Perhaps some of those photos should make their way to this site.  Well, the website is hollabacknyc.com. 
[00:30:00]  Holla is H-O-L-L-A-back-NYC.com.  Holla back-NYC.com.  H-O-L-L-A-B-A-C-K-N-Y-C.  Holla.  Holla!  Let's go to Chris on Long Island.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, I just wanted to go back and say what that girl was saying about FH Riley's.  I was there the other day, and it was awesome.  I'm telling you, the food is unbelievable.  Try it for yourself.  But the weekends are starting to get slamming, so you might want to go a little early or during the week would really be the best time to go. 
[00:30:30]  All right, Chris.  Thank you.  Wow.  Patrice is getting slammed.  Patrice talks some mad shit.  But I bet if his girlfriend says jump, he says how high, yes, pookie, whatever you want, dear.  He really, and then he called you a lying knitter rapist.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  He really.  Yeah, it sounds good.  But then you got to think about something called reality in there. 
[00:31:00]  Which one?  I just don't see many women.  Well, a lot of white guys' perception of black guys in a relationship is the same as the little car drive in Reservoir Dogs,  when they're talking about how black guys treat their bitches and stuff.  And then.  That's why white guys kill their wives on a regular basis.  One OJ, yeah.  But what about the constant, constant white guys putting anchors on their pregnant wives.  Stopped Peterson.  Yeah.  The new guy fucking went to England.  White guys do that all the time. 
[00:31:30]  You know why?  Because they have this real, this illusion of how women want to be treated.  And they do too.  But women don't even know how they want to be treated.  They don't.  They're goofy.  I'm just telling you.  Goofy.  I like how they're goofy.  And I don't treat them bad.  It's not even like, you think because it's tone and what I'm saying that I'm walking around shoving my girlfriend's head in the toilet when we're not having sex.  But it's like, it's like, it's, it's a direction thing. 
[00:32:00]  If you don't give your girl direction, she'll, she'll give herself direction.  And everybody's running around with like their heads cut off with chickens with their head cut off.  Yeah.  I'm just letting you know.  It's, it's, it's a, oh, fuck him.  He don't know what he's talking about.  But they, white guys always end up killing their wives because white women are nitpicky.  See, here's the difference.  I'll give you two differences.  Black woman and white woman.  How do you do things?  I like this.  Black woman, let's say, you know how women get this thing where they feel like, you know, you ever eat at a restaurant and your food, you're brought. 
[00:32:30]  This is the thing that you have to learn how to do.  If the waiter, you go, I want French fries.  The waiter brings you rice.  And your girlfriend goes, he didn't order, he didn't order rice.  He ordered French fries.  He said, excuse me, I'm looking.  And you got to go, bitch.  I'm sorry.  I can be in control of my own fucking carbohydrates, bitch.  Do not feel you need to protect my fucking plate.  Holy shit. 
[00:33:00]  Soon, they try to wiggle in and figure out a way to bitch you up.  All you have to do is have them look at you like, you know what?  This motherfucker is all man.  I don't need to step in unless it's fucking necessary.  I'm in this corner when he needs it, like a cut man, like a boxer.  The fucking, the trainer doesn't get in and go in the dude's ear while he's boxing.  Come on, motherfucker, jab.  At the end, he goes, you all right, man.  Listen, you don't need help.  You need help.  That's what a woman is.  It's like she's in your corner trainer to go, all right, he don't need my fucking training right now. 
[00:33:30]  He's a boxer.  He's a man.  Knows what he's doing.  He knows what he's doing.  It's little fucking things, man, that you have to let them know.  Oh, you know what?  I don't need that.  But women, I'm telling you, they get this thing where, back to the difference.  The black women will go, like, say you go to a store.  I used to have this girlfriend who, it was amazing.  She would get me, if I could wear a shirt and it could be ripped, it could be sweat stains underneath, 
[00:34:00]  it could smell like shit, and she would get my money back.  Because she would go in there, and here's the difference.  She would let you try to be a man.  This is why it's hard.  It's harder to deal with black women.  She would let you be a man for the five minutes that you needed to be, like, to get there.  Like, you go, girl, go in there and get that money for that shirt.  And you would go in and go, um, uh, I had this shirt for six months, and this has a rip in it.  And I was wondering if I could, move, nigga, you ain't doing enough.  This motherfucking shirt is only, it's only been six months. 
[00:34:30]  Give him this motherfucking money back.  Okay.  Black women give you two seconds to try to be a man, right?  And then, you know, they'll go for it.  And it's volatile.  It's a volatile thing.  White people's relationships aren't volatile.  It's the white woman whispering man stuff in your ear until you kill her.  So you kill me.  Are you going to let him, are you going to let him, you know, you're not going to go get the money for that shirt?  Listen, stop being such a faggot. 
[00:35:00]  Stop being such a piece of shit up a sponge.  And go get your money.  Go get him, baby.  Go.  Go get him.  You're a man.  Supposedly.  You're a man.  That's what I heard.  And there's constant needling and constant fucking in your head until you fucking kill her.  You snap and choke.  Because you leave all your emotions deep inside. 
[00:35:30]  All right.  Let's go to Bill in New Hampshire.  Bill, what's up?  What's up, man?  Hey.  Patrice, just getting divorced, an 11-year relationship, started dating this broad, kind of hanging out with her all day.  I'm not really dating.  I'm just becoming friends.  I want to know, how do you think I should play it?  White girl.  Got a kid.  I got kids.  You're just hanging out and shit like that.  But I don't know.  I feel a little, oh, geez, this is a little gay on the radio.  But that's, I don't know. 
[00:36:00]  But you don't sound like you have a specific problem that need be addressed.  No, it's just, I guess it'd be the wife and her ex, those situations, dealing with the exes and the fathers and the mother of the babies.  Oh, just, my girlfriend got a baby from another dude.  I don't even know the motherfucker.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I don't even know the motherfucker.  Really?  I never met him.  How do you play that?  How do you play that?  I have sex with his baby's mama.  That's his situation. 
[00:36:30]  See, that's the thing.  You can't be so attached to that body, man.  Forget it.  It's like, you're never going to meet a girl whose hymen ain't broken.  You know what I'm saying?  None of them are special.  How old's the kid?  About seven.  Oh, Jesus.  Have you ever met the kid?  Yeah, yeah.  She did.  She made the kids.  The kid likes me.  I like the kid.  I don't try to raise her.  She just has to respect me because I'm a real man.  When the kid's father comes around, what do you do?  He don't come around.  He don't come around.  And if he did, they know I exist. 
[00:37:00]  I buy her beds and shit.  I buy her toys.  Oh, you're playing a school.  Yeah, I really confuse the issue with shit.  Right.  Because I'm a nice...  But the thing is, you'll never, ever have to worry about that shit.  Concentrate on your relationship with this chick.  I'm telling you.  Don't worry about it.  You always...  Here's the thing, man.  A good relationship is always one where the girl is a little bit insecure.  Not like, bitch, your breath stink or your head's fat. 
[00:37:30]  It's just that she's not comfortable whether or not you'll be happy if you leave.  I'm telling you.  If she thinks you'll be ecstatic if she leaves, she won't fucking go nowhere.  So you always play the card like you don't give a fuck.  Even if you do.  Nice.  And the beauty of this whole thing is, Patrice's girl is beautiful.  She's gorgeous.  She's beautiful.  Why do you think a fucking mess like me could get a gorgeous girl?  And I don't fuck with ugly bitches.  I might fuck with an ugly bitch.  It's all psychological. 
[00:38:00]  But it's...  I love beautiful women.  I want to get...  It's psychological.  It's a mind thing.  I can't out-fuck anybody.  My dick is...  Hey, hey, Patrice.  You know, I'll fuck a guy.  Some young guy with a good back.  Before we try to move on a little bit, okay?  All right, man.  Can you tell the story you were telling in the office?  Oh, really?  Oh, shit.  Yeah, a few years ago.  This is a real story, right?  Yeah, absolutely, man.  It's based on reality, so it'll be all right. 
[00:38:30]  It's...  I met this chick...  Speaking of chicks and girls and...  Just crazy shit.  And crazy shit.  Oh, and this is...  You know what this is relevant to?  It's relevant to...  If you act like you don't give a shit,  women's power is in your fear of whatever they're going to do.  It's like...  It's like, whatever.  So, I met this girl.  We went back to my house.  We was fucking around a little bit.  So, she was...  My favorite...  This is a sick story.  My favorite position.  My favorite sex anything is not even sex anymore. 
[00:39:00]  This is my favorite thing.  It's I'm laying down.  The girl is draped over my left nipple,  and she's sucking on my right nipple.  I have my thumb in the vagina, like...  And I'm grabbing the ass with my thumb in the pussy.  Can you picture it?  So, my thumb's in the pussy.  I'm grabbing the ass.  I'm sucking her titty.  She's sucking mine.  So, I'm sucking long enough,  and milk starts...  Oh, Jesus.  Milk starts to shoot out.  It gets better, kid. 
[00:39:30]  So, I go...  In my head, I should go,  Oh, this is disgusting.  Yeah.  But I go,  Wow, I'm thinking of, like,  lactate mama's nine,  you know, on the porno.  I'm like,  Wow, this is a porno shit.  This is some...  You know, I'm like...  This is some heavy shit.  I'm like,  Oh, yeah.  She's like,  Oh, I go,  Yeah, where's your baby?  Thinking, like,  A bad girl thing, like,  Uh-huh.  Yeah, your baby's somewhere  with the babysitter  while you're fucking this guy.  Where's your baby?  She goes,  Oh, I had a miscarriage, Daddy.  Oh, God. 
[00:40:00]  So, I should be going,  I go,  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, is that awful?  I had a miscarriage, Daddy.  I was like,  Yeah, I bet you did.  In my head, I was going,  But I just kept going.  Oh, is that horrid?  You just got to stay in character, man.  Yeah. 
[00:40:30]  Stay in character.  Keep going.  Don't even let it freak you out, guys.  I don't believe it.  How freaked were you out?  You had to be freaked out, though.  After she said miscarriage,  but the lactate, no.  I was just like,  Ah, she got a new baby.  It's like, great.  Fucking,  A kid somewhere with the grandmom  sitting here squeezing  milk out of titties and shit.  You're eating dead baby food.  That's what you were eating.  You were drinking dead baby food.  It is what it is, man.  I didn't make up the fucking thing.  It just happened.  All right, we got Lisa. 
[00:41:00]  She's very pissed off.  Is she really?  Yes, she is.  Oh, no.  Lisa in Jersey.  Lisa.  Yes.  Hi, Lisa.  How many girls is he with?  It just shows the product of woman he's with.  I just can't believe that women fall for his crap.  Oh, you're an easy mark.  Listen to you.  You have no guidance.  Oh, I'm an easy mark.  Yeah, I would get you within two days of knowing me, you'll be subscribing.  Yeah, right.  Just by your answer, sweetie, I can tell you. 
[00:41:30]  This is classic.  Yeah, right.  Whatever.  Here's what is on your mind.  I'm a big, arrogant, big mouth fucking asshole, right?  And you want to curb.  You want to destroy that any way you can.  So here's what you do.  If you're pretty, this is where pretty girls fuck up.  They try to hear a giggling.  Here's what pretty girls fuck up.  They try to get me because I'm a fat motherfucker.  So what they try to do is they play the love game.  They give me something they think is precious, which is pussy.  That's what girls have to give. 
[00:42:00]  That's all we have to give?  That can, an attack mode.  What other plan can you have other than your pussy?  An attack mode.  If you want to destroy a man's fucking arrogance, what do you do to do that other than use your pussy?  There's other, oh my God.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Do you hear what she's doing the singing?  Because she really don't have an answer.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  It's like, what else can you do?  Talk about fucking the French rear rear with me?  Innately. 
[00:42:30]  Obviously, you couldn't talk about that.  Yes, I could.  Innately.  Innately.  Here's what you got to understand, ma'am.  We don't like you.  No matter what you know, we don't care if you know all the quarterbacks in the NFL.  We don't know if you, we don't care if you know every team color.  We don't care if you know all the GMs.  We don't care if you know every basketball.  We don't care because innately we don't like you.  So you try to infiltrate your personalities on us and you realize that you're not interested in, 
[00:43:00]  then you try to fuck us.  When that doesn't work, you're ours.  Okay.  Okay.  So that's the only reason that you're interested.  At first?  And then, look it, if I work hard to get what I want, which is pussy, right?  You agree with that, that we work hard to get pussy, right?  Yes.  Then after I do what I do, what's your job?  Don't you like the companionship or some kind of...  Yes, but in a possession kind of way.  Like, you go, wow, this girl, you know what women have to do? 
[00:43:30]  Grow on you.  My girl been around for four years.  Grow on you.  Oh my God.  Yes.  You love...  You have to meet your girlfriend.  I have to meet her.  You love...  I can't imagine that you're dating an intelligent, beautiful woman.  She's a genius, really.  She's fucking a genius girl.  I date doctors, lawyers, people will tell you.  I don't date no fucking homeless people, retards.  No one that dates on Paxil or no shit like that.  Nobody's in bed with you telling you that she just had a miscarriage.  That sounds like an intelligent woman. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, well, that's a goofy bitch, but that's the kind of bitch you...  That's the bitch you fuck when you just meet.  A bitch with lactate...  That's a miscarriage.  That's the price you pay when you meet a bitch off the street.  That was a snack for Patrice.  Yeah, I'm just talking about like a girl like you.  That wasn't dinner.  We would go out to dinner.  You would curse me out for a little while.  You would understand because innately you don't have your own philosophy because you're  not really saying anything now.  Yeah, when Patrice brought up the fact that the pussy's the weapon, when you girls go into 
[00:44:30]  battle for the first time, this is before any get-to-know-you, get-to-know-you, whatever.  It's just...  Because we know that's all you want in the beginning.  That's all we want, but...  In the beginning.  That's not all I want unless that's all you got.  Now, if all you got is pussy, why would I try to...  You don't sound like that.  You sound like, you know, this is the way I keep her on track and this is...  Yes, like, look at your mouth.  Like, you can tell there's no guidance in your life because you're too comfortable yapping 
[00:45:00]  about nothing.  Okay, Patrice.  You talk about nothing all the time.  Right, because I'm a guy and that's what we do.  But you...  But you...  The stuff you talk about that you think is about something...  Gat, gat, gat, gat, gat.  You talk constantly.  Constantly.  Thank you.  But it's always interesting when guys talk.  All right, Lisa.  Thank you.  We got a couple more here.  Let's go to Kevin in Nebraska.  Kevin!  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Jump in. 
[00:45:30]  Find your spot and go.  Hey, Dr. O'Neal, man.  You need to shut up.  My wife listens to this show and you're giving away all my secrets.  I'm sorry, man.  I don't want to get no good soldiers in trouble.  But this is...  This is yapping.  Let's go right to Colorado.  Kirsten, what's up?  Hey, I totally agree with Patrice.  Absolutely agree with Patrice.  Women need to know their place, know what they do, do it well, and please their man.  And their man will be around forever.  Good girl. 
[00:46:00]  Wow.  Forever.  Absolutely.  Men need a rider.  Be a rider.  It's not that difficult.  Keep your mouth shut.  Do what you're told.  Be who you are.  Be the king.  Is that what you do with your girl?  Well...  All right.  Thank you, Kirsten.  Let's go to John in Utah.  John.  Deep voice.  Yeah, I just want to say, Patrice saved my marriage.  I was the doting husband and it was all about her. 
[00:46:30]  Started to listen to him and things were going bad.  So I started going, well, what would Patrice do?  I started following his advice.  What would Patrice do?  It was bad at first, but it's turned her around and we're happier than we could possibly  ever be.  Here's what he said.  Here's what he said.  Here's what he said.  We're happy.  A happy man is a happy relationship.  A happy woman is a miserable man.  Patrice.  Wow.  She wanted me to be the man.  That's what the fucking point is. 
[00:47:00]  You got to do a one-shot deal, a relationship advice show for this child.  Like one hour, two hours, whatever you want to handle.  I'll do it.  It's just simple.  We'll work that out in Washington.  We'll get Patrice O'Neill on the show by himself, just taking calls.  Why it works for me.  How about your relationships?  Here's why you should always understand why it's legitimate.  I'm a fucking mess.  Physically.  I'm going to try to get in shape one of these days, but naked?  If you look at me naked next to my girl, you would go, what the fuck? 
[00:47:30]  My self-esteem has to...  When I fuck her, I have to go, why is she fucking me?  I would never give me no pussy.  And it's like, I'm looking at her going, what's she up to?  This is like my low self-esteem.  It's got to be an ulterior motive.  My self-esteem is so low, it's high.  I go, what is this bitch after?  But I start realizing it's a mind thing.  All they want, all they want is just a motherfucker they can look at and blink slow and respect. 
[00:48:00]  And it's not about beating them and subjugating them.  It's about they look at you and feel like they don't need to be your mama.  That's it.  That they go, wow, this motherfucker is in my corner.  He handles his business.  You know how sexy?  This is what I'm saying.  Your house situation, you become a million times sexier.  Because that's some man shit you did is buy a fucking mansion.  That's some man shit.  You bought a mansion, Anthony.  So it's like your girl can't help but go, this motherfucker. 
[00:48:30]  When you're renting, she can kind of, that other half of her voice that tries to put you down,  she can look at you and go, this faggot is renting at 59.  But now it's like, this nigga's renting a house, this pussy-ass nigga.  You bought a mansion, nigga, in clothes.  She wants you more.  You're hotter.  59, finally.  You're hotter than you was when you was renting.  It's a fact.  Fuck, man.  Wow.  That's really good.  Hey, wait, hold on a minute.  Let's go to John. 
[00:49:00]  You got people, man, reacting today.  Oh, yeah.  John in Pennsylvania.  Patrice, I'm impressed, dude.  You know how to keep your woman in line without a contract.  Yeah, man.  It's mine shit, dude.  It's mine.  I'm telling you.  It's like, it's pimping without beating her and making her sell pussy.  It's just, they want that, dude.  Don't ever let them convince they don't want that.  What will they do without, like, a man's guidance?  You ever see a woman that wants, like, they try to, you see how the success to a woman is being like a guy. 
[00:49:30]  It's like, I do this.  I do that.  I do this and that.  And we can care less.  Like, a sexy man, like, fucking a female Opie, like a woman that's in the same position that Opie's in, is not any sexier than the bitch that works at McDonald's if she's cute.  That's the thing about us.  Good point.  Very good point.  You don't see a woman walking down the street.  A lot of people are calling you the Black Dr. Phil.  Black Dr. Phil.  That's the name of your show.  We're going to give Patrice, like, one or two hours, see how it goes. 
[00:50:00]  Black Phil.  It's going to be the Black Dr. Phil with Patrice O'Neal.  Black-ass Philip.  All right.  Don's listening.  We've got to set that up.  You want to do, I don't know, when would it make sense?  Sounds like I'd get my fucking whole mind straight.  Like, I'd just go off on impromptu.  No, let's just turn on the freaking channel and just let the phones ring and see what happens for an hour.  Yeah, we'll set that up in the very near future.  Let's go to Turtle from Whack Bag.  Turtle.  Hey, guys.  Listen, Patrice, you're absolutely right.  I've been jumping through hoops ever since I met my wife trying to get the pussy. 
[00:50:30]  And once you got it, they put up more hoops for you to jump through.  I got to go home and implement the O'Neal standard in my home.  The O'Neal standard.  Because she knows eventually you're going to figure out, if she doesn't constantly apply pressure, that you're going to figure out, holy shit.  What?  Like, my man, he was nervous that his wife was going to leave him.  And I go, let me ask you a question.  Like, if we really sit down, if my woman left, your woman left, your woman left, you go, what would you really miss about her?  Exactly. 
[00:51:00]  Like, what would you miss?  It's your own arrogance, our arrogance, as men, because they're possessions.  And if they leave, it's like losing your favorite pencil.  But it's like...  Pencil.  He's equating a relationship.  A loving relationship.  Of years.  With a sharp pencil.  Losing maybe your favorite pencil.  Your favorite pencil.  It doesn't even sound like it's a number two pencil.  Where is that fucking pencil?  But that's our arrogance, that's why we lose our minds when women live, because when they leave us and things like that, because we're so fucking arrogant to think that we control them. 
[00:51:30]  I don't think I control my girl.  I just let her know she can't control me, which is all she needs to do.  That's it.  She knows she cannot fuck around with me.  That is not her job to make me miserable.  It ain't her fucking job.  No one says that she's supposed to make me.  Who the fuck...  You know what?  Who says I'm supposed to do anything for you, bitch?  Open a door.  Pull a chair up.  It's all desire. 
[00:52:00]  You better make me want to do that.  Just like I get the desire to want to...  You want to fuck me?  That we do.  That they go, oh, I want you.  I want to fuck you.  And you go, that's...  We do our job?  Make us want to spend time with you.  As opposed to...  All right, let's get back to the phones.  There's some great stuff here.  Assaf from New Jersey.  Hey, let me get this straight.  Patrice, you have a chick who, you know, has a kid from another guy, and then you suck  somebody's tits who had a miscarriage from another guy. 
[00:52:30]  That was a mistake, though.  Yeah.  You don't go into that knowing.  You don't go into that knowing beforehand.  You know what he's trying to say?  Black girls.  Wait a break here.  Wait a break through the stereotype.  That I can't find a bitch that doesn't have a kid or one on the way.  Your ass has been fucked up.  Let's go to Leo in the Bronx.  Leo.  Yeah.  Let's go.  What's going on?  Hey, I got to say that, Patrice, man, you're dead on. 
[00:53:00]  I did my own little thing with a woman.  I've been with her for four years.  And, like, the first three years, I was the biggest motherfucker to her.  And it's like she gave me the best treatment.  I even moved out of state with my ex, and she stood behind me.  I came back, and she just kept on just giving me the best treatment in the world.  And the minute I decided I wanted to try and settle down and treat her right, she started  acting like the biggest bitch.  That's how Harlem got hooked on heroin in the 20s. 
[00:53:30]  They give you the uncut dope, and then as soon as you go, they go, got you, you punk  motherfucker.  That's what they do.  And it's not their fault.  It's not malicious.  It's just nature.  That's what they do.  They can't help it.  All you got to do, dude, is step back, and just like whatever you do in life, that you  just make a conscious decision.  You're going to make a conscious decision that you will live without her.  As soon as she knows that you will righteously leave, she will righteously stay. 
[00:54:00]  They can't help it.  Leave right, leave right, get out of that.  Wow, that is some philosophy, man.  A couple more, a couple more here.  That is some philosophy.  Bam, bam.  Yeah, hey, Patrice, man, you know, that might work for a white-on-white or black-on-black.  Man, I'm a white guy married to a black woman.  And man, if I started all of a sudden trying to do that shit, I would probably get my ass  whipped.  It's not like the attitude thing.  It's a belief thing.  It's like you have to just, look it. 
[00:54:30]  I told my girl she's the fourth most important thing in my life, okay?  Now, and I'm going to tell you what the three ahead of her was.  I'll guess.  It was me.  Career.  My career.  Family.  My mother.  Which is mom.  And then her.  Jesus.  Fourth.  And then she knows she's there.  She goes, but, um, you know, yes, well, you're important, and I consider you to be the person  I'm going to grow old with, so I kind of put you ahead of my family, like my mother or 
[00:55:00]  whatever, and I go, oh, wow.  Well, thanks, sweetie, but you're fourth.  And I love my fish, too, so you better fucking watch your step.  Yeah, what is fifth?  What is fifth?  Fifth would do the fish.  My fish.  So she just beats out the fish.  She beats out my fish.  But they're nice fish, though.  She better be lucky.  He gets the exotic fish.  You know how many people around my life?  She's the fourth most important.  To me, never love yourself.  Never love anybody more than you love yourself. 
[00:55:30]  I love me.  You have to.  Numero uno.  All right.  Let's go to Dave in Iowa.  Dave.  Hey, um, I've been married about 12 years or so, and, uh, I just cannot get my wife to  give me blowjobs near as often as I would like, and, uh, I've tried lots of different  methods.  Ready?  And she just doesn't like it.  Ready?  I just want Patrice's advice.  Ready?  Here's what you do.  Yeah.  They're very competitive.  All right?  What you do is you please her to the utmost of your ability and someone else's ability. 
[00:56:00]  And then when she's pleased thoroughly, you just go and watch TV and say, thanks, sweetie.  I just wanted to please you.  And she'll go, what the fuck?  I'm useless.  She'll realize how this is what you do.  You make her come and then you jerk off and you say, thanks.  This was, that was the best sex I ever had.  And it didn't include you.  And then call back and see if that worked. 
[00:56:30]  You fucking, you please lick an asshole, lick a pussy, your finger, you just fuck the shit  up.  You, you, you, you, you all, you treat her and you do it righteously.  You do it where it's no pretense.  Not, not that you're trying to get your dick.  So you do it.  You, instead of eating pussy, you become a pussy eater.  Like you just do it and love it.  And she, and, and she nuts all over the place and you get her horny as she could possibly be.  Finish her off.  And then you jerk off and you get up and you just fucking go watch TV or whatever. 
[00:57:00]  You'd be disinterested in her pussy.  That's when, cause you're taking away that weapon.  It's like, you ever see a movie when a motherfucking puts the gun to the guy's face?  Yeah.  Pulp fiction.  And he goes, I don't want to blow your horn, man.  That ain't the first time I had a pistol point in my face, motherfucker.  So it's like, when she goes, I don't want to suck your dick.  I don't want to, you just fucking, you just get up and you don't want it.  If she's not getting it to you anyway, don't want it.  She's doing that cause you want it too bad, motherfucker.  Don't want it.  God damn it. 
[00:57:30]  Dave, give this a try and call us back.  All right.  We'll remember you, okay?  My God.  Let's say hi to Mongo.  Mongo.  Hey, guys.  Hey, it's all about like being a POW.  When you're in that POW camp, it's all about, you know, you're not winning the battle.  They're not winning the battle.  You're letting them win one little battle at a time.  They're not winning the war.  You're just winning that one little battle at a time.  Nothing?  I don't know. 
[00:58:00]  I don't know.  I think he might have had a good point there.  Yeah, I think it was there.  I saw his point there.  There goes the steam.  There goes the steam.  Dan in Georgia.  Hey, what's up, man?  I've been sitting on hold for a fucking hour to tell you guys that Patrice and Norton should  have their own show.  And then y'all are up and say the shit that y'all are going to give them a couple hours  of the near future.  I mean, my fingers numb.  We're holding this little big ass for them.  Hey, I love you guys.  Keep up the good work.  You're not there stealing, motherfuckers.  Right on.  Thanks, Dan.  This is what we're going to do because it's very obvious. 
[00:58:30]  We're going to give Patrice O'Neal like, you know, a two-hour relationship show.  And see what happens.  If he wants to do it again after that, it'll be up to him.  We'll work that out in the near future and we'll do it.  We'll find a time that makes sense for Patrice.  In between him being a TV star for VH1 with the WebJunk 20.  Hey, buddy Anthony.  You motherfuckers.  I came in this morning.  Opie's just like, I did come in like a barrel of, watch out.  Wait, wait, wait, wait. 
[00:59:00]  Let me set this up.  Let me set this up.  Patrice did an unbelievable job when Jimmy was out in Hollywood.  I mean, we fell in love with Patrice and Washington did, man.  Eric Logan thinks you're just the greatest thing.  And we haven't seen him in about a month, month and a half because, you know, Jimmy's back  and we're trying to fit Patrice and Bill Burr in because we love these guys too, you know.  And I just noticed a change.  Patrice comes in and it's all like, cha-cha, hey, what's up?  Like, you motherfucker.  It really was.  And it took two seconds.  It didn't even.  I come in and I'm going to shake hands. 
[00:59:30]  Hold on.  Nothing bad, by the way, you know.  No, no.  And then Oak gives me the fist like Oak does.  And I'm tired of you not shaking my hand, nigga.  And Ben, let me tell you something, nigga.  You don't call me asking me for breakfast.  You know, you paged me for.  No, you thought he had an ulterior motive.  An ulterior motive.  To make sure the black guy was going to come in in time or something.  And then Opie's like, wow, you really changed him since you got a hit show.  And I said, damn, I really am an ass right now.  Yeah.  He's bitching at Ben. 
[01:00:00]  Actually, he's thinking because Ben calls him up and like five times to ask, what do you  want for breakfast?  What do you want for breakfast?  And not for a second do I think it could actually be legitimate.  No.  I'm like, man, I know what you're doing.  And then it added on to the thing like, you know what?  Why can't you shake my goddamn hand, Gregory?  I just do the fist.  I know.  And he always does the fist.  But today I'm going, shake my fucking hand.  Yeah, I'm volatile and shit.  But then you go, you know, you're right.  You gave me a tap.  Yeah, I'm like, who am I?  What did I do?  I'm like, you know, Patrice, while you're out there being a star on VH1 and going to 
[01:00:30]  San Francisco to do comedy and maybe another fucking movie, Ant and I sit in that office  every fucking morning from six to seven going, this sucks.  I don't like being up this early.  Ant's on his computer.  I'm on my fucking couch reading my newspapers.  Nothing changes for us as you're like, cha-cha-cha over here and cha-cha-cha over there.  All it took was just that one thing to bring you.  That's why you can't have yes people.  See, that behavior will get me, if people let me do that, I'll be on the first fucking  plane to South Africa, sitting around, acting crazy, because motherfuckers let me come in 
[01:01:00]  and go, shake my hand, nigga.  Right.  You know, it's like, what the?  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  What did you say?  Point four web junk?  What the fuck did web junk say?  What?  Your best line about that was like, web junk 20, it's a hit show for VH1.  And then like, damn, after eight episodes, we already have a best of.  We have a best of web junk 20.  We have a 200-year anniversary after six shows. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, but he's like, it's on so many times, they're celebrating their 200th episode.  It's already a syndication.  He's only taped six.  But it's run probably, someone should do the math.  Those six shows have probably run close to 100 times.  They're doing a best, an hour long, best of show.  Best of.  Oh, that's great.  Let's go to Pat in Boston.  Pat.  Hi, Jimmy.  This is your mother.  The black doctor still says, take one bitch or replace her with five. 
[01:02:00]  I love you.  Hey, that's a great callback.  JT in New York.  JT.  Guys, what's up, man?  The show is going in a different direction.  I don't want to ruin the flow.  No, no, go ahead, go ahead.  Patrice, dude, I've been in a relationship now for four years.  I'm with the lady.  She had a kid before.  We have a kid together.  Man, I ain't got laid in three months.  And I'm just trying to figure out what to do.  I'm not an ugly dude.  I get, you know, numbers thrown at me regularly.  But do I cheat?  Do I stick it out?  I've been trying to get laid.  I don't know what the fuck to do, man. 
[01:02:30]  Help me.  You go, you go.  Let me tell you something.  What do you do for a living?  I'm a full-time student and I'm a barber.  You're a student.  You got women friends?  You know what, man?  I cut them off because I...  That's your fucked up...  Look, let me explain something to you about having a woman in your life.  Can I just ask one question before you go, Patrice?  How old are you, JT?  28.  Okay.  Listen to me, dude.  It's like having a company.  If you own a business, right, and your secretary is the best, like, you go, I'm not fucking... 
[01:03:00]  You know what?  She knows everything about my company, right?  Mm-hmm.  Now, when this...  If this lady just ups and gets a better job and fucking leaves, right, is your company  going to shut down?  Yeah.  You got to keep your company going, even without this person.  And the only way you keep the company going is you have a human resources department open.  You got to always have some other candidates, some other people ready to be interviewed.  You keep it floating out there. 
[01:03:30]  You just don't let them infiltrate your time.  But what you do is you keep them around.  You keep your charm up.  You exercise skills.  Like, if you don't do sit-ups, your stomach gets fat.  If you don't talk to bitches, you lose the ability to talk to bitches.  So that's why you feel stuck.  Because if she dumps you off, you're going to...  You've been communicating with her on a regular basis for the last four years.  So all you know is the little intricacies of your awful shit that you do with her, you 
[01:04:00]  got to go get other intricacies with other women, other skills, so you can introduce new  shit to her.  Because that's what the problem is, is when they think they know everything you had to  say, they're bored with you.  Here's what you've done, Patrice.  Here is the one thing.  Your logic, by the way, is perfect.  I would not criticize it.  It is perfect.  But it is just that, pure Vulcan fucking logic.  You are like Mr. Fucking Spock, because you have taken everything, very logical, but completely 
[01:04:30]  removed any emotion from it whatsoever.  The only factor that you leave out of any one of your analogies, your logic, your fucking  teachings, whatever you want to call them, is emotion.  The fact that men and women get attracted to each other and stay with each other on an  emotional level that is called love. 
[01:05:00]  But Anthony, wait a second.  Okay, Mr. Spock.  Wait a second.  Oh no.  The black Dr. Phil is about to talk.  Our shit is not, you cannot love a woman like a woman loves you.  We, in our soul, we're not people who go boo-be-boo.  If you, if you put us in the room and then introduce us to that shit, we would never go  boo-boo-boo-boo-boo.  We would never rub our thumb over the top of your girl's hand just to show the affection.  You would never just constantly clean fucking sleep out of her eyes. 
[01:05:30]  You don't think that shit happens?  Cause they fag us up into loving them like they love us.  So the love they give us, we give it back.  But we love like, we love like, you know what?  He's got an answer for everything.  He does.  I love him.  How do you love, you know what?  You, you ever had a dog you loved?  Uh, probably when I was a kid.  You ever had a dog you loved?  Oh yeah, of course.  People who love their dog, right?  And I'm not saying women are dogs like dogs, but the way you love your dog, that's the  way men love.  We come in, we sit down, and our dog sits there and has the emotion that we have. 
[01:06:00]  That's why we love, that's why a man's best friend is, cause it's like, we like, fuck!  And the dog's like, fuck yeah!  And then you're like, oh, I'm down.  And the dog's like, you know what?  I'm down too, nigga.  So, it's like, that's how we, we're not emotional like that.  We're doing, we just sit there with our hands on our balls, trying to figure it out.  And we need something there that's gonna let us figure it out.  Not always, you know, just, I wanna be with you, I wanna help you, I wanna do things for 
[01:06:30]  you.  You just want, you go, sweetie, you don't understand how much I would love you if you didn't  talk to me right now.  Like, I would just love you.  I would love you if you didn't exercise, you didn't exercise your, the privileges that  you thought you had.  My ex-girlfriend to this day, good friends, man, and we had a talk about why we broke up,  and I said, wow.  I said, you know what?  You see how, like, how cool you are right now? 
[01:07:00]  Like, how, like, I go, I get off the phone and you go, alright, talk to you later, sweetie.  And I go, hey, listen, I gotta go.  And you go, alright, cool.  Or, I say I'm gonna call you back and I don't, and you don't go, why didn't you call me back?  Like, you just, are cool?  She goes, yeah.  I go, why couldn't you be that cool when we was together?  Because it's entitlement.  That's the word.  She used the advantage that she had in her fucking, in the, the, the, the, the title that  I gave her as girlfriend, and she thought that that's what she's supposed to do. 
[01:07:30]  This, they're not supposed to do that.  We can change the whole way they think, man, if we just apply ourselves.  She don't cause me problems.  She don't.  And I told my, my girlfriend now, who was with me, and this is true, and I'll tell her this,  I don't show off.  She was with me for four years.  I've been with her for six months.  Oh, my God.  Red Beard.  Oh, shit.  Red Beard.  Yeah.  Jump in, Red Beard.  I got a question for you, Patrice.  Me and my wife have been together about ten years, and when I'm eating her out and fingering 
[01:08:00]  her and just going at it, you know, full blast, best eating she could have, she, when she's  about to climb in, she pushes me away and closes her legs, says, no, I can't, and just  says, give me the dick, give me the dick.  Do you know what's going on?  That's, that's rape fantasy.  She's guilt, she's, she feels guilty for the pleasure she's having about sex, and she  might have been touch funny.  And that's no bullshit.  And that's no bullshit.  She might have been touch funny because she's.  He does, an answer for everything.  Because she, she, she does not, that, that pleasure is guilt for her. 
[01:08:30]  And what that is, is when, like, you read about it, when, like, little kids are molested,  it's like, they feel good when they, when it's happening, but it's like, this is bad,  and the feeling in the body is good in some fucked up way.  I've been with a couple of girls molested, so, you know, you're talking through, and it's  like, what happens is when they get that, set that feeling of, like, oh, oh my God,  this feels good, they shut down because it's like, it attaches themselves to some fucked  up thing.  So, you gotta just let her. 
[01:09:00]  If someone was choking you with a vanilla ice cream cone, it would be like, oh my God,  I'm being choked, but you'd still go, that tastes really good.  That's, oh my God.  Right.  So you just have, what you have to do is let her know it's all right, that it wasn't  her fault, and it's all right to just, for her to be the whore.  Just to let her know it's all right to be a whore.  I want to move on, but the phone calls are too good, man.  Oh, they are coming in like crazy.  Scott in Jersey, what's up?  Yeah, Patrice, you helped me have the best sex I ever had.  All I had to say was, it's cold out here. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, we gotta play that for you.  Go find that.  We're gonna change gears in a second here.  We gotta find something for Patrice, but first it's Janet in Ohio.  Janet.  Hello.  Patrice, you're full of bullshit.  Ooh.  You know that?  Yeah.  I hate to tell you something.  Listen, there are men, like Anthony said just a little bit ago, that do love each other  with women and are very kind, because my husband happens to be that way.  And that's why you're such the pleasant animal you are now. 
[01:10:00]  You're just so lovely and just like that.  And you know what?  The comfort zone you have in talking to me like that, imagine the comfort zone you have  with your fucking husband.  He does not like you.  He gives you things.  He gives you things out of obligation, asshole.  That's what he does.  Shit.  Yes.  Yes.  You couldn't.  All right.  Make me like you right now.  Be likable.  All right.  Oh, Jesus Christ. 
[01:10:30]  You're so full of bullshit.  Make a sexy voice.  The voice you use for your husband when you're turning him on.  When I'm turning him on?  Exactly.  Repeat the question, because you don't have an answer.  You just go, fuck me, love me, feed me.  That's what you do.  That's what you got.  My girl would never get on the fucking phone and talk to other soldiers with your fucking  voice, because she knows that, you know what?  The only thing keeping motherfucking men from running shit is the fact that we let you talk. 
[01:11:00]  Like the fact that I'm allowing you to just talk to your husband, let you get up and go,  honey, get up.  Come to bed.  Do this.  Go feed to this.  Go take care of that.  And he goes, OK.  And you know what I would say to you?  Shut your fucking mouth.  Let me, you know what?  I'm 36.  Who the fuck are you talking to?  That's what I would say to you.  And then what would you say?  Move your bullshit.  That's all you would say.  You would understand that the power that you have is the power I let you have.  All right, give Janet a second.  Go ahead, Janet. 
[01:11:30]  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Hey, I happen to be 31.  So is my husband.  Mm-hmm.  And he doesn't let me talk.  We talk because we enjoy each other.  Mm-hmm.  And that's the way it should be.  Really?  Is that, why?  When is, is he on the phone?  Is your husband on the phone?  Where is he at?  No, my husband's a truck driver.  He's a truck driver.  Exactly.  Wonderful job for a woman like you.  That motherfucker's on the road seven and a half days out of six.  No, no, no.  Just to get the fuck away from you.  You are so fucking full of bullshit because he's not gone seven days a week. 
[01:12:00]  My husband's on the road seven days out of six.  No, no, no.  That is brilliant.  No, no.  He'd rather see, he would rather see the weigh-in station than to see you and your fucking annoyingness  because I hear the entitlement in your voice.  You're talking to me like you talk to every guy because your husband enables you to say shit like that.  You shouldn't be that comfortable being annoying.  You shouldn't be that comfortable.  You're a 31-year-old truck driver's wife. 
[01:12:30]  Let me tell you something.  I still happen to stay home with my two beautiful girls that need me, and that's why he gave me the option of doing.  He gave you the option of doing?  No, he asked me if I wanted to work or if I wanted to go and stay home.  He gave you that option.  See, that's the silly part of what you're saying.  What is the choice between having a career and taking care of your kids?  Is there an option to that?  Oh, yeah, because kids are a career because you got to have a career. 
[01:13:00]  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait, if you had a choice to work or take care of your children, which one would people say they're going to do?  More than likely, probably take care of their babies.  Take care of their kids.  So where's the option that he gave you?  Here's the option he gave you.  Stay the fuck home while I drive around away from you.  That's the option.  No.  I like how he puts it, the lowest common denominator.  Trace just whittles it down.  Because that's what it is. 
[01:13:30]  Because that's the most, I mean, all men are that way.  We just spent eight months trying to get women to listen to the show.  And in one hour, Patrice has swept the floor clean, man.  They're back to their morning zoos.  But you see what she's saying?  I'm an asshole.  Hate is the same thing as love.  Do you hear the emotion is evoking?  She's getting built.  That turns into pure, raw, fucking prehistoric energy this lady has. 
[01:14:00]  She hasn't had it in years.  Prehistoric.  Call me an asshole again, baby.  Say it.  Just say it.  Because you're an asshole.  You hear how delicious that sounded?  You hear the little giggle?  Patrice, I got to ask you something.  That's my next wife.  I got to ask you something.  Yeah.  I got to ask you.  Like, the way you sound, you make it sound like every guy is capable of this type of action that you do.  It's absolutely.  But let me put it this way. 
[01:14:30]  Some guys, their girls are so important to them that it's almost like you're saying, let's say you're in Vegas.  You got a pile of fucking chips.  Pile of chips.  Yeah.  These chips mean a lot to you.  Right.  You seem like the kind of guy that is willing to put that motherfucker down and, look, I'm gambling it.  If I lose it, what the fuck?  If I win, hey, I got twice as much.  Because you are willing to take a relationship and lay it on the line and willing to have it walk out the fucking door. 
[01:15:00]  Anthony, you're a movie genius.  What did De Niro say?  What was one of his famous lines from fucking Heat?  Oh, shit.  Heat is one I'm not as familiar with as the other.  He said, don't attach yourself to nothing.  You can't walk out in 30 seconds or less.  And that is how you're supposed to approach it.  As soon as you feel the heat on, as soon as you feel like, whoa, this is not fun.  There is not one reason why you should have a bad time in a relationship. 
[01:15:30]  Why?  I come in here, right?  If I come in here every day for four hours, at what minute do I cause you motherfuckers pain and suffering?  At what minute do you cause...  702.  702.  But you know, do you cause each other pain and stuff?  Like, because you think you can.  You know, you come in, you're like, what's up, O?  He goes, what's up, man?  Blasey, blasey.  What are we going to do today?  We're getting along.  But that's a relationship.  So at what point do you...  There's ups and downs and... 
[01:16:00]  There's enough fucking downs that's going to happen without the help of the motherfucker you love.  But don't you think that if you're willing to put yourself in a situation where you're able to walk away in 30 seconds like that,  just walk away, that maybe you're putting up some barriers that you could be having an even better time if you would invest a little more that you couldn't possibly walk away in?  Absolutely.  No?  This is...  Listen. 
[01:16:30]  I can only...  I'm just playing the pussy with that.  No, no, no, no.  I can only love...  And this is anybody.  I can only love somebody 90%.  That's the most love I can give.  That's the highest.  Because I have to save 10% to survive in case that person ain't shit.  In case they leave me.  In case they cheat.  You go 100% and you're shooting yourself.  You go 100%...  Jump out a window.  What have you got left for you?  You understand?  So I need something to survive. 
[01:17:00]  Human nature is human nature.  I don't plan for it.  I just go, I'm going to survive it.  So when I say 30 seconds or less, that's euphemism.  That's hypothetical.  But I'm saying, sweetie, if you don't threaten to leave me, just leave me.  Because I'm not going to play the game with you.  It's like I have to survive.  I have to survive without you if you decide you...  That's the control...  Power corrupts.  If you give a motherfucker power, they're going to abuse it.  I do comedy for a living. 
[01:17:30]  The worst thing you can do when you're bombing in front of a crowd is try to make them laugh.  When I bomb, I chase the motherfuckers out the door.  Leave, faggot.  You don't like it?  Go.  Go fuck your mother and go.  That's a great philosophy.  And you know what they do?  They don't leave.  Let's go to Slim.  Slim in Georgia.  Slim.  What's up now?  I just called to call Patrice, um, lying motherfucking ass out.  Go ahead.  First of all, that motherfucker talking about, I don't know where the fuck he got his old  lady from.  He got to do like Eddie Murphy and go to Africa and get one of those Goona Google bitches. 
[01:18:00]  But I'm telling you like this.  That motherfucker would not talk to no black girl the way he talking to me.  Yeah.  Dude, I, I, you know what?  A lot of motherfuckers, I'm a real black girl, man.  Let me tell you, I'm going to tell you something, man.  I'm going to tell you something, man.  That works mostly on black women because black women give you, give you the attitude that  you have to, that you have to control.  Now, here's the thing, dude.  People hate, you don't know me, man.  People hate me so much that they would do nothing more than to want to see me be a hypocritical 
[01:18:30]  fat fucking asshole.  Niggas know me.  I, when I have a girlfriend, man, black, black, and more black, you don't ever see  me with no white girl, half white at the most.  Like my girlfriend now half white, but I'm going to tell you, I apply it to progressive,  like, like, like this, a girl used to go, she was a lawyer, used to call a bitch, shut  up, bitch.  And she goes, she used to cry and go, I can't, I can't have my friends see me and call me  a bitch.  I'm a progressive black woman because, because I, I tapped into, I tapped into a primal 
[01:19:00]  thing with her.  That's why, let me tell you who the dirtiest women are, fuck wise, who you can fuck easy,  a doctor, a lawyer, a fucking professor.  You know why?  Because all day long they deal with phony men going, yes, yes, Professor Jones, absolutely.  When really our relationship with women are, mm, God damn, you got some nice titties.  So, where did they get, when they get off work and you meet them and you go, what do 
[01:19:30]  you do for a living?  I'm a teacher, really, all day controlling those kids with a fake relationship, really?  Let me suck, let me suck on those titties.  What?  Shut up, let me see one of them titties.  Why are you saying this?  I don't know.  And then you're fucking a teacher or fucking a doctor.  I'm telling you, Oprah is an easy leg.  Let's get a Bob in Pennsylvania.  Bob.  Hey, how are you?  Hey.  A couple of callers ago, the guy called in and was asking Patrice for help, and Patrice  mentioned about, you know, keeping his skills sharp and all that kind of stuff, and I can 
[01:20:00]  just honestly say, what he said worked wholeheartedly, and I've been married 10 years, and about  two years ago, that very issue saved my marriage.  When we got married, you know, I dropped every contact of females that I ever had, you know,  to please my woman, and, you know, from then on, it just kind of got boring, and, you know,  our sex life was, it was there, but it was like once a week, but it was out of necessity. 
[01:20:30]  It wasn't out of one.  And about two years ago, I started, we had two kids, and, you know, more money, we needed  more money, so I started bartending, and, you know, on the weekends, my wife would, you  know, we'd get a babysitter, my wife would come down while I was working, and she'd see  me interacting with all these people, especially females, because we have a lot of females  that come to the club, and from, I swear to God, from that point, she was fucking me  regularly, and it was just because, it was along that line of what Patrice said, exactly 
[01:21:00]  what he said works.  And if they, and if she thought for a minute, this is women, they compete with other women  physically.  Like, guys compete with other guys mentally.  Like, you would be upset if you saw somebody talking to your woman, and she was like, sitting  there like this, with her hands in her chin, like, listening to some guy's horseshit.  Yeah, all intently, and laughing at his shit, and.  This girl is like that, she had to compete with what she has to compete with, which is  she starts fucking her more, and starts, you know, applying herself sexually, knowing that, 
[01:21:30]  oh shit, there's another chick that will take my place immediately.  That the love you give her, man, she has to earn that love.  But the thing is, women don't have, and again, do you think this shit is all fucked up, but  when do, did a woman, did a woman ever need to have skills in the love department, in the  getting a guy department?  Never, they don't have the skill to keep a guy.  We have to teach him the skill to keep us.  Like, my girlfriend, my girlfriend is my girlfriend right now. 
[01:22:00]  Until she leaves me, since she's somebody else's fucking girlfriend.  But, but, but, but like, I never, I never fuck her the way she, like, like, the first  time we started fucking, she's like, I like, I like when you rub this again.  I said, I'm not doing some shit some other motherfucker did.  Nigga, you my girl now, bitch.  I'm nibbling the back of your kneecap, so you can tell the next nigga that you like, you 
[01:22:30]  like your back of your kneecap, nigga, nibbled.  You watch your fucking, I said, niggled.  All right, listen.  Holy shit.  All people trying to get rid of this shit for the last hour.  No, it's classic.  Honestly, it's great.  I mean, we could do another half hour.  There are guys taking notes out there, Patrice.  Yeah, Nighthawk.  Yeah.  I've never seen the phones like this.  I'm not even kidding.  You know, I say a lot, you know, the phones have exploded and they do, but it's been constant  for an hour and a half.  Nighthawk, what's up?  Yeah, I just want to agree with Patrice. 
[01:23:00]  I'm a truck driver.  I do stay on the road to get away from my bitchy wife I've been married to for 17 years.  See?  See that Ohio?  See that Ohio.  Miss Ohio?  No, I'm from Tennessee.  No, no, no, not you.  Janet.  There was Janet.  There was a lady that called in earlier.  Yeah.  There was a truck driver.  And it's like, yeah, it's a perfect job to have a, because you know what?  How can you have a job where you long, like you driving and you long to see your wife? 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  You understand?  It's like you would never be a fucking truck driver.  He go, man, I'm going to work in a fucking warehouse before I be on the road six days a  week from my beautiful, lovely fucking woman.  There are jobs where all of a sudden you're sent away from your wife or girlfriend or  something, and you're just, like, ripped apart there at the airport.  Oh, man, man.  And this guy's choosing to leave his wife on a daily basis.  And drive 1,400 miles away.  Yeah, yeah.  And sleep in the back.  And risk getting killed at a rest stop. 
[01:24:00]  And fucking right.  And it's like, but I love, it's, you know what?  Every guy out there, I understand this, because I love, it's not, loving you is easy,  ladies.  I love my girl.  The thing is, like, constantly liking her.  Constantly liking her is what the problem is in relationships.  I love, she knows when you love her.  You love your girl because you fucking bring money home to her.  You bring you home to her.  But that doesn't mean, like, if I bring myself home to you, can't you fucking just do what 
[01:24:30]  I need to do to keep me fueled up to be a man that you can be attracted to?  That's what the fuck is going on, ladies.  Not that we don't love you.  Not that I'm a fucking caveman.  It's just, just don't think that I'm supposed to do shit.  I'm not supposed to do a fucking thing.  All right.  Hey, guys.  Patrice, I am learning a ton from you today.  I'm 36, married 12 years.  A while ago, though, you were talking about the dog analogy, and I want to make sure I 
[01:25:00]  get this correct.  You're saying that if we're out to eat and my wife reaches across the table and eats  my steak, I could kick her in a lever.  Oh, well, now, that could fatally injure the dog.  You might be confusing a few different topics here.  Is there a playoff game on the TV at the time?  But just the last little thing about eating and things like that, here's the thing.  It's like, don't you ever get, everybody is in a relationship, but aren't there times in 
[01:25:30]  the relationship that your girl does something and it evokes some type of, not in your mind,  it consumes your body how much you don't like her at this moment.  And it's not even tangible, but it's things like eating hot, yes, waiter, I'll have a  steak, some chicken, and Caesar salad.  And then, what do you have, sweetie?  Oh, I have a salad, and I'll just eat some of yours.  It's like, bitch, no, you won't. 
[01:26:00]  That's codependency that's infiltrating my space.  Get your own, I'll pay double.  Order your own fucking chicken.  Order the same chicken that I get so you don't taste mine because I see what you're doing.  Do you think that that shit is like something, you know what it is?  I didn't even identify that as anything but her going, I'm not going to eat enough.  But you see it with like x-ray vision.  You have fucking, you have like vision like bugs have. 
[01:26:30]  Like we look, we see this, bugs look, there's all kinds of fucking fluorescent shit and infrared  and ultraviolet.  That's how Patrice sees shit.  I see a girl going, you know, I'm really not that hungry, I'll get a salad, I'll eat  some of your food so it's not so expensive.  He sees this controlling fucking bitch is being codependent through his fucking ultra vision.  His sight goes right to the DNA.  His sight goes right to the DNA.  Because it's a gut feeling.  You feel how you feel.  Feelings are real. 
[01:27:00]  So if you feel something and you're a rational person, you go, okay, usually I'm a rational  dude, but I'm feeling something right now.  Yeah.  It's like, you know what?  Sometimes I might overreact fucking, it might be three times out of ten or some shit I might  be wrong on it.  But it's like, look, why are you eating from my, it's a, it's a hours, it's a, it's a,  it's something of yours that's now mine.  I never would have thought of that in a million years.  Bitch, I don't give a fuck if you're not hungry.  Order, order ten states and we'll put it in the bag or we'll throw it away. 
[01:27:30]  But you're not gonna fucking, not order so that you can eat off my fucking food.  That's what we're gonna try to do.  I love it.  Two more phone calls and then we're gonna take a break because we've been going like  an hour and a half here.  All right.  Susan in Vegas.  Damn.  Hi, I have a question for Patrice.  Yeah.  I've been having an affair with this guy for quite a while and his wife is like the woman  from Ohio.  She's a total bitch.  Everything is, everything is about her.  She's the center of her own universe and I'm the total opposite and I'm wondering if you  think that maybe I'm playing my cards right and he might actually smarten up and leave 
[01:28:00]  her one day.  No, I'll tell you why.  Because every man, every woman, everything wants to have his cake and eat it too.  You are the eat it too.  It's like, unless you give him an ultimatum, which is not the ultimatum like, hey, you  gonna leave her, me or him.  What you do is you love yourself enough to leave.  You don't make a big deal out of it.  You go, sweetie, I understand you love your wife and you love me too, but you know what?  Time is ticking for me and I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna go and you go with love. 
[01:28:30]  The ultimatum.  You go with love.  You don't say fucking leave him or me.  You just go with love.  You just, you know, it was great.  Just be good to me, basically, which a lot of women don't like.  You know, remember that song?  Just be good to me.  Friends, tell me I am crazy that I'm wasting time with you.  You'll never be mine.  But he's treating you good.  That's what the thing is.  He's treating you how you want to be treated.  But if you want more, don't say you want more, because you gotta understand, our thing is 
[01:29:00]  not our body.  We give our bodies freely.  He's not giving you anything that he gives a fuck about.  Time is what's important to us.  So the more time you can get him to spend with you, the more important you are to him.  So right now, he doesn't want to give, it's just like a woman that doesn't want to take  it in the ass.  It's like, I give you some pussy, but I don't want to go to the ass.  That's all right.  He's giving you dinner and a movie and sneaking around from time to time, but he's not giving 
[01:29:30]  you the ass, which is him, which is the title.  And she wants that.  And you want the title, but you can't, just like a guy can't force ass fucking on you,  you can't force time on him.  You can't rate time.  So you gotta, like, step back and allow him to desire to give you that time.  The ultimatum doesn't work.  Don't give the ultimatum.  Don't give the ultimatum.  And the have your cake and eat it too thing that you brought up is interesting.  What if the cake is drunk?  What if the cake is drunk? 
[01:30:00]  It's that rum cake.  Now it's rum cake and it's drunk.  And it's made with scotch.  And the cake, the cake gives you an ultimatum.  You want to see how fast you run out the fucking door and leave that cake to rot by itself?  Oh, you buy frosting for that cake every three months.  And it costs a lot.  But you will run from that fucking drunk cake.  Wow.  And right to the cupcake.  Sweetie, just walk away without him feeling like he's being pressured. 
[01:30:30]  Because a lot of people, like a lot of women do that.  They don't want to just break up with you.  They want you to be an asshole so they hate you.  They don't want to just walk away.  Don't try to do something to, like, fuck him up so that he, like, okay, like, call his fucking house and say that you're the girlfriend so that he fucking hates you and then says, you fucking cunt, die, die.  And you go, fuck you, fuck you.  And then you feel better because it was like, oh, he's an asshole. 
[01:31:00]  I can hate him now.  What you do is, look, you know what the fuck he was in.  There was no contract.  You just got caught up.  You're in love.  Now, put it on you.  Step off.  Just say, okay, I'm going to be done with this part of what we're doing.  Yeah.  And that's the only way you're going to get him to go, you know what, I left my fucking wife.  But then to really be honest, sweetie, if he left his wife, would you really still be into him as much as you into him now?  All right, here we go. 
[01:31:30]  She's gone.  Here's the last phone call because we don't want Patrice to blow his load.  But we're going to give him a show, a relationship advice show in the very near future on 202.  Jeannie, New York, finally.  Hi.  I've been married for a year and a half.  I've been with the same guy for five years.  And thank you, thank you, thank you, Patrice, for finally saying the way it is.  I think the key to a good relationship is that the woman has to realize that this is the way it is.  Wow, look at that.  Yep.  And a lot of women feel that.  But it's hard to just, it's hard for a woman, that goes against everything about women in this society now. 
[01:32:00]  Right, right.  Which is to submit to a man or to be humble to a man.  It's against what we do.  And so what she's saying is just nature.  She's attracted to her man because she can't run over the motherfucker.  She loves him because she can't stomp on his guts.  That's why she's into him.  That's why my girl's into me because she can't abuse me.  All right, stop there.  I love it. 
[01:32:30]  We're going to take a break.  My God, Patrice.  A lot of people are suggesting a name for the show that Patrice could have in the near future.  Yeah, we like the Black Dr. Phil.  That was good.  Someone else is suggesting Bitch Management with Patrice O'Neal.  If you got a good name for Patrice O'Neal's show for...  Relationship Junk 20.  Bitch Junk.  Bitch Junk 20.  Use the instant feedback and give us suggestions for the name of Patrice O'Neal's relationship show he's going to do in the near future for us. 
[01:33:00]  I love my girl, by the way.  Just let y'all know.  We'll do a one-shot show with you a couple hours and see where it goes.  Maybe it'll be a regular feature for a while.  You never know.  But we want to stop here so you don't blow your load so you have more stuff that you can do on your own.  Something tells me he could go for fucking days and not blow his load on this subject.  All right, we're going to take a break.  We got a song that someone sent in, Patrice, for you.  We're going to play it for you next because we really got to regroup here.  It's about that rest stop story and they put it to music for you. 
[01:33:30]  It's pretty funny.  I don't think you've heard it yet.  All right, we'll do that next.  Sweet.  Clean-cut white guy.  Abercrombie and Fitch.  What's up, man?  He goes...  Holy shit.  Did you hear me, E-Rock?  No.  Oh, no.  And you've been doing so well.  What the fuck?  E-Rock.  You said to have it ready.  E-Rock.  Oh, my God.  Play back the fucking show.  I'm not even going to...  I'm not even going to, like, defend...  I said after the break.  Oh, my God.  At first, we were going to play it during that break, but then we went so long ago. 
[01:34:00]  After the break, you'll hear the song.  Is this on?  I bring nothing to the table.  I bring nothing to the table.  I bring nothing to the table.  E-Rock.  You lose, what were they, GBDs?  He just lost 20 GBDs.  20 GBDs.  He's been doing really a lot better lately, too, man.  Just listen.  Sometimes we change in mid-sentence.  You know something?  Oh, Danny walked into the studio, opened the door, pointed at E-Rock, and laughed. 
[01:34:30]  And laughed at him.  E-Rock, I got to be honest.  I never listened to what Opie says as far as instructions go on how this show is run.  And even I knew he wanted to go to break and then come back with that song because we should, you know, take a break.  Yeah, that's what we're going to use to regroup, to be honest.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  What happened?  Anyone else want to come in and point at him and laugh before we go to break? 
[01:35:00]  Uh, Thans.  They're all raising their hands.  Okay, everybody who wants to come on in and point at him and laugh.  I bring nothing to the table.  Oh, there's Travis.  Thans.  Oh, look.  Oh, even interns.  Oh, my God.  E-Rock's throwing things.  Steve, should he have done that?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, I didn't think so.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Oh, good Lord.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame on you. 
[01:35:30]  Oh, yeah, well.  That was terrible.  That was really bad.  Hey, bud, what's your problem?  Boo.  I bring nothing to the table.  Boring.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Oh, is that horrid.  You all right?  Yeah, I'm fine.  Yeah.  I fucked up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe just a little bit.

[01:40:00]  this is it yeah this is it this is life and what you get come on have a ball sunday monday  happy days tuesday wednesday happy days yeah how are they gonna get those thematic shows with some of  these assholes in there well we're moving on up to the east side to a deluxe apartment 
[01:40:30]  in the sky anthony hates the crooner on that crooner it's a one-dimensional by the way i know we're  hoping he would get voted off one dimensional singing that's he's done yeah that's like joe  cocker guy i'm sorry he's got a couple of layers to him but crooner is always one-dimensional it  doesn't matter what category they give them they're like okay rock songs from the fucking  70s yeah well we were just another band out of boston on the road trying to make ends meet 
[01:41:00]  dude it doesn't fucking work when they showed him last night all i could think about was your  impression yesterday i was laughing so hard at myself on the couch last night like what  and nailed this one so you hate the crooner oh god i can't stand him  gone then the uh the puerto rican john candy guy he got uh he got voted on puerto rican john candy  or um fat gomez adams yeah he got voted i like to call him he was the one that did uh copacabana  badly who thought who's the best guy probably best guy it's between like the the shaved head 
[01:41:30]  guy that did the bon jovi song the rocker the rocker yeah dead or alive wow screaming it out but  he's good though yeah he's really yeah but you know he's getting a little annoying because uh they  did that uh take it easy song to start the song take it easy that was actually really cool i thought  they did a great job but then the alt rock uh singing dude yeah shaved head with the the fancy  like sideburn crap that he has to design every uh night he he jumped in with take it easy 
[01:42:00]  yeah because they have everyone else out of the game i thought they have all the great story though  do like um great story yeah what's the story patrice and let me tell you what's gonna happen  his his in auditions i'll help you out but his his story he's been singing forever in in uh local  clubs and bars he quit his he quit his career to to help raise um you know marry a woman and raise  her kids her kids you think that's gonna be america loves that kind of shit yeah but you think that's 
[01:42:30]  gonna be the case when he makes top five he's gonna say goodbye to her oh of course that's not the  point get rid of that sludge but but it's like right now that'll get him to that point you know  what i mean people just love and a rocket might win it just because because you want to take bets now  who'll win i think he'll win it just because both by should have won it last year yeah well you know  who i like uh now that i took a second look is the guy that did simple man yeah but he i want to see  what he's gonna come up with a little too much he might not have any diversity whatsoever either 
[01:43:00]  he's another like growler yeah because they had it last night they did the fucking uh eagle song  and they come out and to hear all their different styles they're lisping guy from levittown  who's just like i'm running down the road trying to loosen my load i got seven women  cindy brady's singing and then he's four they want to hold me two they want to sell me one  says she's a friend of mine and then take it easy yeah oh oh he should be singing metallica you 
[01:43:30]  know yeah take it easy yeah how about fat mama what do you think she's fat mama could sing man diesel  but she's got an ass that holy shit it's all ass so that ass moves differently than the rest of her  body though it has big all over and then her ass takes on proportions where i cannot whenever that  ass is on the screen nothing else is it i get tunnel vision everything's blurry and i just see  that ass yeah she got that little torso that's why it's like oh it's like that short midget's torso 
[01:44:00]  that little kid from levittown almost actually got caught in her orbit  her ass has gravity but she can see and she saw and she was smart because i i missed i saw the  want her saying i went to sleep they haven't seen it since but she sang like a rock song right yeah her  song was like and that was smart to do because that's their whole thing is like can you sing  songs that's not your song you know what it amazes me and here's the difference between the black  contestants and the white contestants on american idol black people can get up there and take a rock 
[01:44:30]  song or any other song and make it their own they could add twist to it take a rock song and there's  trills in it and shit like that make it like changing the arrangement and everything and make it sound  good the white guys and girls pretty much are doing the song the way you hear it on the on the record  yeah and that's why i think a lot of some of the well most of the black singers that have been uh in  the finals have uh looked better and come off better because they put uh a little extra something into it 
[01:45:00]  like that but getting back to mandeza whatever the hell her name is yeah her ass is like you ever try  to like uh carry like a bucket of water and and all of a sudden you get that water moving and you try to  balance it out are you saying that's what her ass is a balanced bucket of water well it moves it's it  moves differently from her body like it's a bucket of water and you'll you push to the left a little  too much and now the the water's in motion you're trying to bounce it all out again but that ain't  even covering it i'm thinking hefty bag full of mercury try carrying a hefty bag full of mercury 
[01:45:30]  and you're squeezing and it flies up both sides of the fist all it takes is for a little bit to get  over one side of your arm and the whole thing goes that's what i'm saying it's just i'll pop it  though and you're like i'll pop it of course you would you fucking pop that you also like the hottie  from flavor of love of course you like a mess i just would love to see that just to watch her any  belly button and then they then they voted off the the emotional chick that looks like she's like  uh one bad review away from razor blades and a warm oh right the chick that did the uh kind of um 
[01:46:00]  almost operatic bullshit and they were very careful how they talked to her at the end of  the show yeah because they know she'll kill herself they i i believe that she's emotionally unstable  yeah she's like the chick from american beauty you know she's got that like kind of creepy look to  her you know creepy she looks like she would i don't know i don't know do something bad to herself  well they're gone yeah thank goodness i i think it went as it should have  uh next week though i don't know you gotta finally get rid of a lisp guy i don't know america 
[01:46:30]  because now you're thinking america's voting they're not voting anthony stop dude stop america's  voting it's american idol they're not voting they ryan seacrest tells you how many calls they've taken  stop it's true i hate ryan seacrest by the way it has paula's doing better this year though paula i  hate her too because she has to say something nice about everybody she's trying to change they flipped  her up and do you see like how every guy now since she got like accused of fucking that dude yeah 
[01:47:00]  every guy sings a song to her yeah they're like i love you paula can you suck my dick i love you paula  i love when they change the words to put a name on that  everybody's trying to tap into the fact and like that there was he got the voter on some bald dude  whatever but he was singing to her yeah and he's like will you dance with me paula and she's like  i can't like they told her no more jerking off the test it's stupid sweet paula abdul 
[01:47:30]  this is this is the you know it just makes you sick but it's the it's it's you cannot not watch it  yeah you like to see people's fucking dreams destroyed and that's what it is it's more about  destroying the people than it is watching people win everyone thinks their votes count no way it's  five five guys behind the scenes so be because the voting was too perfect america's not that smart 
[01:48:00]  america's filled with dummies you think america didn't vote for carrie shrug or whatever name or  carrie underwood or whatever carrie underwood you don't think america voted for anybody who won  i told anthony uh for carrie underwood after watching the show uh i think i watched two maybe  three episodes i said she's gonna win it all don't even need to watch really good i i hadn't i it was  guaranteed i thought bo bice was gonna win it i just thought he was very good man there's audio me on  this radio show a year ago whenever the last idol saying she will win and it was so early on it was  gotta watch you gotta keep watching it had nothing to do with america because as it because it was easy 
[01:48:30]  this time around once you start getting deeper into it and they're knocking more people off and  now there's more talented people then you'll start noticing like why the fuck they throw that person  off so you'll you'll notice it is this stupid american public i think patrice is on to something i think  they're finally ready to get some kind of rock uh rock dude in there i mean both guys people were so  upset with that dude was far in a way the best like he made me i'd never watch american idol ever until  like i caught him i was like damn this white boy you know because my racism performer my racism kicks 
[01:49:00]  in right away yeah like i'm like this fucking white boy he's singing like you know like all right he's  all right and then i watched me i said damn bo bice this motherfucking is good and he was having to  make songs his own like change him around a little bit fucking guy could sing but i i always thought  like i here's the reason why i believe america um votes is because i said before clay that is an american  thing how ruben beat clay yeah because because that says america is is less comfortable with fags 
[01:49:30]  than they are with niggas like if it was like they voted for a nigga because it's like i ain't voting  for this fag i ain't voting for a faggot and and and if and if it was up to the judges vote for the  black man you made us you tricked us on that one the five people you talking about would have voted  for clay that would have been their choice it was just better the guy was better than uh ruben i don't  think clay was better than clay was better ruben was average you think clay was better i think he's  a flaming faggot but i think vocally he blew ruben away the guy has range uh i was gonna say range up 
[01:50:00]  the ass but you know i can't even argue i want to argue just argue but i he might be better but that  but it's just like that's america so that even that even validates all more fucking albums he sold  you know how many albums that little faggot is sold much more much more than uh ruben that right  there well there's more you know there's more people for clay to sell it to you know yeah a lot  of old people like this shit all right so uh when is american idol on again monday uh monday tuesday 
[01:50:30]  wednesday thursday friday saturday sunday i think it's on right now i think we're missing an episode  now monday tuesday they have the girls on monday i think yeah or tuesday or tuesday the girls on tuesday  the guys on wednesday and then they vote people off on thursday thursday is the best one to um dvr  because uh you just want to get to see all the james deferred by the way i don't know if we're  gonna get to this today because the show is just flying by uh we did this with patrice about a month  ago hot country songs the top 10 country songs i love this there's six new ones in the top 10 so 
[01:51:00]  because the honky tonk but donka donk honky tonk but donka donk yeah that's still in the top 10 of course  it is you see the video it's fantastic uh just might make me believe is still in there when i get where i'm  going is still in the top 10 and jesus take the wheel we had fun with those songs jesus take but  there's new ones like your man living and fast forward what hurts the most living and fast forward  probably uh the story of uh the guy getting fame uh get drunk and be somebody she don't tell me to

[01:57:00]  i'm sure some of them will be there  a few of them will be there  yeah  it's at the javits center  uh  today  tomorrow  and sunday  uh  four to eight today  eleven to seven tomorrow  and eleven to six on sunday  and  it's like superman batman  and all that stuff  yeah  who is the most expensive comic right now  oh i  i don't even know  like what's a big one  have to be  number one superman  number one  superman  action  spider-man  action comics number one  spider-man one  superman  probably a biggie  spider-man  by the way screw all that  it's good to see you live  thank you 
[01:57:30]  yeah you know we had a lot  i had a lot of phone chats  well he went  all right  well if people uh remember  big kev uh had a stomach staple  you used to weigh how much  um close to six hundred  close to six hundred pounds  you're down to what now  uh about two seventy five  that's fucking amazing  he cut himself in half basically  more than half  yeah  two halves  four hundred pounds or something  no it would be  if two seventy five  and two seventy five  would be five  five fifty  and if he said  almost six hundred  it's a little more 
[01:58:00]  oh my god  maybe he cut himself  uh fifty two percent  right  how's that  he's going through  some old pictures  and found some from  any w when you were  hanging out  and forgot how  huge you were  not only that  so he loses all the weight  right  so now he's got  all the extra skin  he went in and got  that removed  which was like  serious surgery  life threatening shit  actually part one  and I have to actually  have another one still  to go  is there any way  to keep from having  the skin  like  can you work out  once your skin  is stretched to the point 
[01:58:30]  where it can't snap back  there's no  there's no other alternative  other than to have it removed  oof  and sometimes  that looks worse  than like the fat  oh yeah  how many pounds of fat  or skin they take off  I should say  in the first surgery  it was about  thirty five pounds  thirty five pounds  of skin  thirty five pounds  of skin  all his body  I lost thirty five pounds  in seven and a half hours  he's gonna show us  the scar eventually  eventually  wow  it's actually about  forty two inches  would you go  would you not do it again  if you could  would you like 
[01:59:00]  lose it on some  old fucking  rowing machine  well no  because  well I had a medical condition  so  there's an old picture  of him  this is the only way  yeah  that's fucking  you can't even really tell there  cause you need  someone like  and he remember  we used to hang out  with y'all  you used to see  like  you know  you listen to like  your bodyguard  when you walk  up the street  and just be by yourself  like back a couple of years ago  Kev is with you  and it's like  you and your girl  and him  it's like  all bodyguardish  and shit  that's right  but it was just a fat man  with a problem

[02:00:30]  alright  very good Kev  thank you  we got  Joey Mack  outside  which one's Joey  Joey that's you  right  Joey Mack  is 31 years old  he's from  Washington Township  New Jersey  he's a paranoid  schizophrenic  wow  his occupation  is pizza delivery  guy  info on this guy  musician who  doesn't play  live shows  sounds like  a man's dick  caught in a  dirt devil  whatever that  means  is that something  Steve wrote down  Steve will help  us out here  and he also 
[02:01:00]  thinks planes  are going to  crash into any  building he is in  well we all  think that  he says he's  the next  American mess  something we've  been doing  every Friday  on the program  some Fridays  there's a complete  bust no one  shows up  other Fridays  people show up  just looking for  unusual people  to show up  does he think  a plane is going  to crash into  this building  right now  I didn't ask  I would assume  if that's his  phobia  it certainly  stopped him  from coming in  last week  because he was  supposed to be  here last week  and he freaked  because he found  out he was  coming to  New York City  oh yeah  New York City  did you write 
[02:01:30]  sounds like  a man's dick  caught in a  dirt devil  who wrote  that down  I think  Bill copied  that off  of his bio  oh okay  hold on  we have a few  songs he did  as well  oh really  myspace  yeah  let's go to  Andy  Andy  hey guys  what's up  what's up  I just wanted  to thank you  guys for  coming in  on Friday  you know  I know  not all  satellite radio  hosts come  in on Friday  so I just  wanted to  thank you  guys  yeah  it's begun  right  Howard's only  doing four  days a week  yeah  yeah that shows  that he still  has passion  to do this 
[02:02:00]  yeah they had  to lull  the listeners  into that one  because a lot  of them would  have been pissed  off if right  off the bat  they go hey  I'm paying  but I'm paying  for four days  worth of shows  yeah  now that's  exactly what  you're paying  there you go  there's a guy  that still has  the energy  and the passion  to do radio  that's going  to give you  a good show  he couldn't  wait to get  the four day  work week  going  yeah  he waited  how many  weeks  eight weeks  for uh  waited  how long  has he been  on  I don't even  know  however many  weeks he's  been on  month and a 
[02:02:30]  half maybe  that's how  long he waited  to come up  with best of's  yeah  so there you  go  there's your  hero  he does four  days a week  because he  still has the  passion to do  this  hey what's the  deal with  David Lee Roth  over at  K-Rock  why  I'm kind  of hearing  the midday  show that  awful JV  and Elvis  or whatever  their name  is  is going  to be doing  his shift  for a little  while  for a little  while  and then  Kid Chris  over at  YSP  is going  to be doing  his shift  for a while  and Kid 
[02:03:00]  Chris was  kind of  sounding like  he's going  to be there  for a little  while  does anyone  know  and after  eight weeks  David Lee Roth  is taking  a vacation  David Lee Roth  is a complete  disaster  in radio  here in New York  City  it's too bad  the rest of the  country doesn't  get to listen  to David Lee Roth  it is god awful  and the company  what would you do  to help him  Infinity Broadcasting  knows they made  a huge mistake  and I think  that might be  one of the reasons  that someone  is flying in  you think it's  possible to do  better  what's bad 
[02:03:30]  he had a couple  meetings  and they gave him  a tryout  in Boston  I'm convinced  almost anyone  could be  entertaining  on the radio  for four hours  almost anyone  but the problem  is doing this  day in  now do it  tomorrow  yeah do it  tomorrow  the next day  we're having  a great show  today  you know what  Monday comes  no one's  gonna give a shit  wipes the slate  clean Patrice  and that's the  problem with  the business  we're in  you have to  perform  day  every fucking  day 
[02:04:00]  and he just  doesn't have it  the pressure's  on every day  damn it  these famous  people  they don't have  the work ethic  they don't have  what it takes  to try to come up  with new stuff  for a radio show  it's a disaster  I could have  told them  as soon as  they signed  him  I'm gonna  change the  subject though  did you get  Bob's email  we're meeting  with him  I guess  next week  just changing  the subject  now people  want us  now they're  gonna have  to pay  for it  so 
[02:04:30]  where were  we with that  we don't know  why David Lee Roth  is all of a sudden  not working  but it can't be  it can't be  for a good reason  no  it can't be  not after 8 weeks  it can't be  because he deserved  a vacation  you don't take  8 weeks on the air  and then  especially in the  high pressure  situation that is  and where you want  this morning show  to succeed  and have them  take time off  we were here  I think a year  before we took  time off 
[02:05:00]  it just doesn't work  what does David Lee  what is that one  that's parody song  oh the song  yeah  forget it  I thought  Joel Hollander  was smarter than that  to be honest with you  he was hoodwinked  by David Lee Roth  yeah  I thought he knew  what radio  was all about  so  you want to talk  to this  Joey Mack guy  let's bring him in  Joey  and be a little fearful  yeah it's American mess  this is Joey Mack  I feel bad  for mental people  hello sir 
[02:05:30]  hi  how are you  I'm fine  sir  how you been  very good  very good sir  very good man  doing alright  how are you  take a listen  to the music  ah the music  listen to it a little bit  what's this about  the music  it's about  dogs  and all  bestiality  we like the  different weird stuff  we like the spontaneity  of just popping it on  it's not one of those songs  you hear on the radio  that's going to make you cry  it's one of those songs  where you just blow stuff out  and make people laugh  make people real gangster  it's fun like that 
[02:06:00]  alright  yeah  we just knock stuff out  we're not going to  we're not pulling any punches  when we lay down our tracks  in the studio  I like that  you make that up  pull any punches  when you're talking about  we  you're talking about  yourself and all the  other people  that live within your head  or is it a real band  no no  well the lyrics  get written down  the lyrics get written down  and my initial thing  was I'm not saying this  man  he's like come on man  we'll get you a Ferrari  I don't drive a Ferrari  yet but you know  offered a Ferrari 
[02:06:30]  I'm singing it  come on  so this music's  going to get you a Ferrari  no it won't  it won't ever  like logistically speaking  so you don't write your lyrics  someone else is writing this  and you have a voice  yeah but he bases it upon  like you know  like we do a therapist session  you lay down in the chair  and tell me  you know  everything that happened  everything that went on  you know  you lay down in the chair  you tell me what's happening  with uh  there's a lot of songs  about jizzing  like you know  Meg's  you know  he's just like  you like the jizz  he throws the jizz  at you know  Jodie Foster  and it's just like  outrageous  right  so  yeah of course 
[02:07:00]  yeah so he just wanted  he just wanted to catalog  this aspect of the  paranoid schizophrenic  and how much he likes  to pleasure himself  you know  maybe  maybe fear is having a kid  maybe fear is love  maybe the last girl  was so terrible to him  so that's the way he is  I want to write this down  come on Joe  and this is you  for me  this is about you  kind of thing  yeah it really is  from he takes  you see he takes  from outside of me  he can look at me  and he can say  alright this is what  I see coming from you  this is what I'm  going to write down  alright how old  were you when  either you 
[02:07:30]  no either you  or someone else  said okay  there's something  a little weird  going on here  with this guy  oh yeah  jerk off weirdo  yeah sure  oh the other guy  the guy that writes  the lyrics  no  with me  okay hold on  with me  something weird  going on  somebody hold up  the mirror  we're talking about  you  okay  let me get this  straight  I want to know  wow  because I asked  a simple question  I want to know  what do you say  I'm the jerk off  what  jerk off weirdo  jerk off weirdo  I just want to know 
[02:08:00]  like you  you've been classified  as paranoid  schizophrenic  yes  now how old  were you  when either  doctors  or somebody  decided  and what  happened  that they said  we got to  take this guy  in  I think I was  18  18  was my first  hospitalization  how old are you  now  I don't know  what Dr. Gold  categorized me as  then  I left after  one week  because I had to  go see a blues  traveler show  so at that point  I left  much more important  than mental health  much more important  yeah 
[02:08:30]  because it solved  a lot of things  then  so I keep going  at one  and like the  underground  wherever I am  you know  how old are you  now  so I'm 20  let me answer  your question  I got diagnosed  with a paranoid  schizophrenia  at around age  21  21  but now  you had to know  before then  that you know  something was a little  miss  yeah  like how old  were you when  you were thinking  wow I'm kind of  fucked up  oh man  I think that  about myself  now  yeah  but were you like  there's no cure  there's no cure  yeah  but were you like  12  16 
[02:09:00]  like when did you  when I said I was  weird 12  when did you  12 I probably  thought I was a weird  kid  like 12  I had confidence  I had girlfriends  I don't think there  was so much paranoia  what about parents  there was a lot of  drinking though  you know  maybe that has  creates the  how old are you  so hard  to communicate  with him  alright there's the answer  31  and the thing is  yes Patrice  if you don't listen  if you kind of  just glaze over  it  it's like you're  talking to him  and then eventually  you'll squint  like you'll go  huh  what did he say 
[02:09:30]  yeah  what just happened  yeah  it's almost so  regular  I find it  I'll be honest  with you  I find it very hard  to carry on a  conversation with you  like I'm talking  and I'm asking  questions  and you're  talking back  but you're not  answering  and you're going  off on these  weird tangents  all over the place  I'm fascinated  but his tone  is so rational  yeah  like he's just  answering the question  how old are you  28 let me ask you  a question  it's like a  Bush press conference  they ask him a question  and he goes off 
[02:10:00]  on something else  and he's 31  and he's got  a really bad  dry mouth  by the way  yeah I didn't  get any water  alright let's go  to Scott in Jersey  Scott  hey yeah  for Mac  since there's  five of them  what Washington  township are you  in  which county  which county  Gloucester County  oh damn  thought I knew  you from my  county  I'm sorry  well we got  this music  let's get back  to the music  part  so it's  Joey Mack  songs  you're singing  on these  yes  you did a duet 
[02:10:30]  with Jay-Z  nah we weren't  actually in the  same studio  he did a duet  with Jay-Z  I hate to give away  the magic  that was  tacked over  yeah because  now everyone  is surprised  that it actually  didn't happen  right  it's the magic  of bootlegging  bootlegging  and recording over it  hey man don't expose  illegal bootlegging  man we didn't know  we didn't know  what was happening  before  he did a duet  with Jay-X  not Jay-Z  I think Jay-Z  takes it as a compliment  Jay-X  right 
[02:11:00]  oh man  Jay-X to the  fourth power  alright so  this song  what's this song about  maybe we'll have  better luck  just playing some  of your music  the one with Jay-Z  is da-da-da-da-da-da  yeah of course  I think it's about  jerking off again  jerking off  you like to jerking off  man I lost my girlfriend  I just thought about her  all the time man  while I was jerking off  do you jerk off  in public and all that  yeah she like  she like calling me  a paranoid schizophrenic  she said it in a cute  enough way  I didn't get offended

[02:17:30]  in the long run  I mean I do  what's uh  let's get back to the anal sex though  yeah  what uh  what is it  that is so bad about that  yeah the anal sex thing  that's like touching a nerve dude  why is that  why though  it's literally touching a nerve  and a couple of capillaries  can I ask  can I ask you maybe a personal question  okay  alright  the diagnosis of a paranoid schizophrenic  well  okay 
[02:18:00]  wow  he's uh  put it in his schiser  okay  he's put it in his schiser  he's a paranoid schizophrenic now  okay  he's changed  he's morphed into this  um  what you have is  what you have is  someone that has had the experience  and suffered from it  so  I can't say terribly  but just didn't like it  just didn't like it  I think I'm  I think I'm getting a vibe  so like  that's why  like he doesn't like anal sex  I don't like it  right  that's why he doesn't like it  because he's had it happen to him  he's had it happen to him  paranoid schizophrenic 
[02:18:30]  he put it in his schiser  now he's paranoid  don't fucking like it  so schiser is asshole  I understand  schiser shit  yeah  yeah  so schizophrenic  the paranoia part  let's just say  let's just say  hypothetically speaking  if this was to happen  how old would this  uh  guy have been  when this happened to him  uh  right  right prime  in his prime  in his sexual prime  so 18 years old  so like 18  running down the street of Philly  trying to get to work  trying to get to work  can't make up his mind  whether he wants to sit  in front of a car  or get back to work 
[02:19:00]  you know  and then something gets  after a burger  and then something gets  put in his ass  no  that happened the night before  the night before  a little anal  a little anal  happened  oh yeah  and that'll fuck someone up  and your therapist  will tell you  dude you're a paranoid  schizophrenic  is it true you wore  a roadkill squirrel  for a week  roadkill squirrel  the roadkill squirrel  yeah  yeah you can do that  in the country  in the country  you can take a knife  to a roadkill squirrel  you pick it up  you put it in a little  plastic bag  you throw it in the back  of your car 
[02:19:30]  and then you make it  your like little pelt  you make a pelt out of it  who did it  I did it  I did the work myself  and then what do you do  with the pelt  you did it or he did it  the pelt  you can throw it around  the room  and say flying squirrel  you can wear it on your head  you can wear it as an earring  you just throw it around  the room and go  hey flying squirrel  hey don't get rabies  if the squirrel had the rabies  don't get them  no  yeah man  and then you just throw  the pelt around the room  it's fun  it's good entertainment  that does sound like fun  but me and the boys  drink at home  that's what we do  I told you no drinking  you're a schizo  who said that 
[02:20:00]  who told you not to drink  yeah  certain therapists  man these are probably  the DTs right now  could you hold your hand out  yeah  these are DTs  wow  wow  holy mackerel dude  you are shaking  dystrophy tremors  name your poison  because I need another drink  what do you like to drink  I've been on a bender for  I like the Jack Daniels  Merlot  Cabernet Sauvignon  the guy goes one experience  to the other 
[02:20:30]  wines beers yeah  I like Thunderbird  and then Dom Perignon  Thunderbird yeah  I like the heroin  and Shirley Temple  yeah well the Long Island  iced tea is a good heroin drink  that's a good one  it's pretty much  knocked you out the same way  did you have sex  with your dog  is that true  Snowflake  I'm asking  I buried her man  I buried her  knowing that about her  she got a hysterectomy  from the infection  that she got  after I touched her  so yeah  so she got buried  but she lived  another two years  after you had sex 
[02:21:00]  I was the one  who decided to leave her  out in the cold  that was my decision  because it went down  to 18 degrees  little bit of guilt  and I'm like  well okay  do I let her inside  and let her live  or do I let her die  because I couldn't handle  the guilt probably  probably the guilt  it was the guilt  why did you  fuck your dog  she was in her dog house  she was in her dog house  no it was just  the cold air  the cold air took it  she was always  an outside dog  but she was guilty for  she was 15 years old  when she died  that's how long  sheepdogs live  but why did you touch  your dog like that 
[02:21:30]  I don't understand  that part  she had no tail  you know sheepdogs  have no tails  maybe  you know it was a joke  put some butter on  let her lick it off  and then you know  and then you  it was so weird  and then after you did that  you were guilty  you probably didn't want  to look at the dog  two years later she died  she died two years  do me a favor  give him a blanket  and a fly  so he could just sit there  and fuck you  no because I've heard  is your mother in a fruit cellar  she likes fruit 
[02:22:00]  have you stabbed a bitch  because you had sexual feelings over  no  alright good enough  I've heard of this  like with the dog though  because I understand  the dog ate your prime rib  during a playoff game  and you kicked it in the liver  and then had sex with it  and it died  he's just an excitable boy  yeah  and it killed her  and raped her  then he took her home  well he's just an excitable boy  what he made a house  out of her bones 
[02:22:30]  and everything  I think we're going to end  the American Mess contest  yeah  did you really have sex  with your dog  Warren Zevon  no  did you have sex  with your dog  which phone  snowflake  yeah  how was it  it was an experiment  I was still in high school  walk us through  how that works  there was a joke told  like you know  you put a little alpo  on your dick  and let her lick it off  well somebody made the joke  and I actually executed 
[02:23:00]  the action  and after the dog  licked it off  it felt good  it felt good  I did  yeah yeah  that was fucking awesome  right  so what made you decide  to take it a little further  see I know  that I'm going to get  some Newark 69's  when Joey rapes  my canine  I'm Joey Mack  and I'm back  and I'm feeling like  I'm fucking black  big cock  big nose  bust a nut  on your rack  I'll make you scream loud  bust a nut  in your ass  open your mouth  cause I'm coming  really fucking fast  sick rapping  sit  slapping nose  stop it  let it happen  all you haters

[02:35:30]  over this shit  I'm not too cool  when you know  I bring girls home or something  and he fucking weird  it happens  it absolutely happens  he talks to my younger friend  like my friends are my age  he hangs out with my friends  cause  wait you're trying to just get laid  bringing chicks back to the house  and he's talking a little crazy  he'll play that music  you know  where he's talking about  raping my ass  and gsn  and raping your ass  and you're fucking his dog  you know what  that's the funny thing  I got blamed for fucking the dog  on the school bus one day  by my neighbor  who lived behind me  years later  it all came together 
[02:36:00]  when he came out  and said that  he was the one  what the whole neighborhood knew  that the dog  one guy  and how did the guy know  he lived in the backyard  of Jason in our backyard  and the dog was an outside dog  I had no idea this went on  he was blaming me  he's like  you raped your dog  you sick bastard  what are you talking about  10 years later  he's making these songs  and it all kind of  comes together  all 10 years later  it sucked together  and made some sense  now  so you slam his head  against the tile  and then  he slams my head  against the tile  yeah  no no

[02:38:30]  to say  dude  you fucked a dog  and he's like  oh my god  I did  and he has a guilt  that's his  schizophrenia  it's his guilty  that's his fucking personality  it's the guy sitting on his shoulder  he's guilty about raving his brother  he's guilty about fucking a dog  he's just horny  you're not crazy  you're just horny  you're just really horny  you're a fucking sex fiend  who's done some fucked up shit  so do you think he molested his brother  absolutely  that's what  that's what drove him  that's what drove him 
[02:39:00]  over the fucking edge  and his brother forgave him  I needed drugs for that  and he didn't forgive himself  I didn't know  that he forgave me  he said I'd be doing drugs  trying to get out of this universe  you forgave him  tell him you forgave him  Joey  Joey  Joey  Joey  Joey  Joey  look at me  it's alright  I love you  alright  we work together  alright  don't worry about it  and he detached  he detached himself  from the fact that he's his brother  you see he goes  hey nice  nice knowing you  we're from the same balls  ain't we  it's like  he had to detach himself  he loves you Joey  no no no  him to you  like  he has this distance from you

[02:48:30]  think we're  gonna end the  old bit  wow  that was a  little too  real today  I thought the  the Sheen  brothers were  fucked up  yeah  these guys  are you know  when I handed  over those  scissors Poe  the look Poe  gave me first  of all and  then the  concentration on  the scissors  Poe was  burning his  eyes into the  scissors and  looking at  everything else he  could use as a  weapon against  those scissors  like I saw him  looking at the  stapler knowing  that that would  defend against 
[02:49:00]  the scissors and  then the tape  dispenser which  has the sharp  edge that cuts  the tape he's  looking at that  as some kind  of blade and  somehow he was  going to defend  us all with two  oranges in front  of Iraq and I  had total faith in  that of course  all right Poe  all right we're  gonna take a break  and hopefully we'll  do something very  very different  wow  oh man I need  some ACDC to get  back into a good  mood I'm downright  depressed after that  last segment 
[02:49:30]  why I think that  went well we got  two brothers back  together again  a bit on the  creepy side  creepy yeah  this American mess  thing is a very  interesting bit but  it takes a lot out  of the host  yeah because you  see the you see  how real it really  is as you're  talking to these  guys I'm glad  Bill Burr isn't  here today because  I would not want  to walk down the  sidewalk today with  Bill giving me his  whole speech about  how horrible it is 
[02:50:00]  and bad and making  me feel bad about  what I do for a job  that's what Bill  does when we have  guests that are a  little off and we  ask them certain  questions that we  might not ask them  yeah make them do  certain things they  might not want to do  I walk down the  sidewalk after the  show to the corner  with Bill Burr and  Bill just talks about  God I was into it at  first and then I  start feeling so bad  and then I get in my  car going and I hear  Bill's voice in my  head going I feel  bad and then I'm  going what do we do  for a living really  yeah oh my god I'm 
[02:50:30]  making my money off  other people's sorrows  and this is terrible  and I don't need Bill  Burr's voice in my  head if Bill Burr was  here today for that  he'd go home and  shower shower with  Brillo pads Brillo  fetal position on the  floor just try to get  rid of the dirtiness  Robin Long Island what's  up Mr. Nice Guy  yeah I got a comment  but went on during the  break Anthony's pal  talk triage is one of  the funniest things I've  seen in a very long  time  oh you were you were  watching that of course  I was people don't  understand the power I 
[02:51:00]  wield in pal talk I I  use it wisely and I  use it I'm very nice  about it I am Anthony  the merciful most of the  time I don't ban a lot  of people as we know the  live pal talk room has  hundreds and hundreds of  people in it every day  they grow in every day  too they listen to the  show they watch the  show they watch what we  do during commercial  breaks they listen to  what we're talking about  when the mics aren't live  for XM they get the  exclusive yes I'm sorry  two people I am you you  pardon them and then you 
[02:51:30]  just pick people at  random to start banning  out of the room yes  there is a rule on the  pal talk don't I am me  I'm trying to read what's  being posted on the chat  board because it's it's  like the new instant  feedback I can read some  lines are funny I'd like  to convey them to the  audience I'm looking at  pictures of what's going  on someone saying check  out this guy's camera this  girl's camera and I'm  trying to look and the  second I look over bing  there's this huge I am  blocking my view now I  got to take time out to 
[02:52:00]  get my mouse and click on  it and close it and then  the I am again so I got to  go into the administrative  tab on help and block him  from I am pain in the ass  so I bounce people that is  when they are thrown from  the fucking room right now  sometimes it's an innocent  enough mistake a lot of  people brand new to the  room they will say hi  Anthony and I'll be like  please don't I am me boink  gone and then I'll leave  them alone that is  considered I pardon you I 
[02:52:30]  pardon you I give them a  pardon yeah you have spared  my pal talk live I am you  and me Anthony so you let  me go that one day so  really easy and I can see  everybody on the thing I  want to see you can watch  the show through pal talk  so now during that  commercial break I got a  little angry because I  kept getting I am by  people so I was blocking  them from I am me but not  banning them and then  people are saying you  should ban them and almost  calling me a pussy so I  had to wield a little power  I had to show so I just  picked a random person who 
[02:53:00]  was minding their own  business I don't know what  they were doing a random  name and banned him just  just show the power that  he has sometimes in the  camp you have to pick out  a person and put a bullet  into the back of their  head just to show the rest  of the camp you mean  business unbelievable so  that guy had to take one  for the team now how much  it costs that I believe  it's something like sixty  dollars a year so for it's  a year and I got to go get 
[02:53:30]  a camera and you don't need  a camera the mic mics are  built into the cameras these  days you don't need a  camera though you can check  out other people's video  sixty dollars a year and I  could just talk to some of  these animals let me tell  you the ONA rooms are huge  there are hundreds of people  that go in there but there  are plenty of other rooms  there are adult content as a  matter of fact we did this  yesterday swinging rooms let  me show Patrice maybe a little  yesterday explain Patrice what  we saw yesterday bisexual  woman room well Anthony just  there's a whole bunch of you 
[02:54:00]  know dirty rooms and Anthony  just said I'll just pick this one  at random and he truly picked  it at random and then picked  on a cam at random at random  and what we got to see was we  don't know if it was a guy's  gentleman we don't know if it  was a guy's foot or a lady's  foot yeah gentleman was bent  over a lady or a gentleman it  could have been a lady I think  had her foot her entire foot up  his asshole her entire foot she  pulled it out and his ass so far  up we couldn't figure out if it  was a fit or a hand or a hand  until she pulled it out and then 
[02:54:30]  it started foot when she pulled  it out his ass started moving  like a horse does after it takes  a dump and it looked like pizza  more like a volcano that was  like a volcano yeah so let me go  to it could go to bisexual  please oh sexual female of course  Jesus pumpkin this is why do I get  into this stuff 16 years later I got  a myspace account now I'm happy  about it now yeah motherfucker my  space is like take a random look I'll  go to adult now you go to  playground which is right there and  here's the list there are 351

[03:08:00]  but my hernia  is acting up  guy's gonna be  jacking at you  in front of a  camera tonight  animals  a lot of people  are saying  they want to see  Patrice's web  junk tonight  web junk  that joke's  coming in a  million times  right now  Patrice's gonna  end up on  his own show  look at this  motherfucker  oh shit  that's me  hey we all  heard of  wife beaters  right  yeah  you know  what a  wife beater  is  yeah  there's a  couple of 
[03:08:30]  ways that  could be  used  Italians  I think  yeah but  it's  wife beaters  the guy  that beats  his wife  or it  can be  a shirt  yeah it's  it's kind  of like a  tank top  that girls  like to wear  and they're  called  wife beaters  it's just  the accepted  name for  those type  of shirts  it came  about because  guys that  wear those  types of  wore those  type of  shirts years  ago with  you know  gravy stain  on it  or something  like that  it's the  stereotypical  guy who  would smack  his wife  around  sit around  the house  like that  order her  around 
[03:09:00]  and watch  TV  so it  got that  kind of  reputation  and now  it's called  a wife  beater  and everyone  knows it  as a wife  beater  well the  politically  correct  folk  want to  take  wife  beater  away  from us  good  they want  to take  the wife  beater  and call  it what  the child  molester  oddly enough  slightly  disapproved  somewhere in  Boston  can we 
[03:09:30]  talk this  over  shirt  can we  have a  talk  talk this  over  hey  mary  go get  my  have a  respectable  rational  conversation  out the  fucking  drawer  would you  I want  to go out  and do a  little boxing  can you  go get  my  hey  listen  listen  we can  agree  to  disagree  can you  get the  fucking  white one  I want  the white  agree  to  disagree  you fucking  mook  that's the 
[03:10:00]  couple  counseling  tea  let me  just put  on my  maybe we  should have  our own  space for  a while  shirt  and we'll  talk later  but some  store up in  Boston got  in trouble  because they're  advertising  you know  wife beaters  wife beater  that's fair  though  why  that's what  they call  it  you know  what  it's not  fair  you can't  give any  of this  shit  away  because they  take that  and they  go for  something  else  very fair  I go with 
[03:10:30]  that because  I preach  that but  I'm saying  that's the  way you  have to  think in  this society  we have  a lot  against us  you can't  just start  giving shit  back  they never  actually give  it back  can I  be  devil's  advocate  now  I'm  saying  what if  there was  boots  called  fag  stompers  that's what  they called  it  fag  kickers  right  and they  were Doc  Martins  we all  know  they're Doc  Martins  but it's  like okay 
[03:11:00]  for a store  to promote  fag kickers  I understand  we call  it  let's just  call it  it but don't  put it up  on your  signs in  the stores  you can't  promote  hey this  is a  wife  beater  but that's  what we  call it  but even  if they  everybody  calls them  wife  beaters  the odds  that those  boots are  going to be  called that  are slim  to none  well  not really  I know  and I'm  ready to  lace mine  up  and I  ask where  they are  hey  where are 
[03:11:30]  the old  fs's  bring them  on over  well  here's the  news story  wife beaters  bad term  building 19  circulars are  meant to get  your attention  maybe make  you laugh  but some  shoppers  weren't laughing  this week  when you  heard about  this what  did you  think  I can't  say what  I thought  I know  what I  thought  but I  can't  say out  loud  what I  thought  at issue  a three  pack  of men's  undershirts  advertised  as wife  beaters  that does 
[03:12:00]  you know  go to  numbing  and dumbing  down  and  normalizing  and suggesting  that battering  is a normal  behavior  oh  come on  I don't agree  with that  you pointy  lady  and it's  building 19  do you know  what building  19 is  it's the  shittiest  shit store  they must  love it  it's disposable  t-shirts  like you would  buy them  as if they  were napkins  it's that type  of store 
[03:12:30]  where they  sell socks  that say  socks in the  front  that's it  just socks  and it's a  pack of six  and it's  irregular  and it's  fucking  they sell  underwear  and then  next to  underwear  they sell  cups  that's what  the store  is  and it's  not an  important  place  it's just  and the way  they advertise  they have a  cartoon of a  guy  you know  like  boing  with glasses  and stuff  and it's  like  come on  down  so you know  it's just  a fucking  joke  yeah  you know  it is  what it  is  man  but that's  see 
[03:13:00]  I can't even  play devil's  I can kind  of see  Patrice's  point  now I  I'm against  any kind  of thing  I think  if a store  wants to put  up a fucking  sign that  says we  sell  wife beaters  if you're  offended by  it  don't buy  anything  in that  store  if it  doesn't  offend  you and  you want  to buy  a wife beaters  go in  make your  purchase  I don't  like any  groups  saying  this  offends  me  I don't  like  I don't  care  the fact  that  you know  they also  call them  guinea teas  is that  going to  annoy me  I was an  Italian-American  I'm very  offended at 
[03:13:30]  the term  guinea tea  would you like  to see a  fucking  nigger pants  or fucking  chink shoes  or something  like that  it upsets  me  I could  give a  shit  what they  call the  fucking  things  so I  would walk  in and buy  it  if there's  an Italian  group  which there  are plenty  of  they don't  like the  Sopranos  they don't  like this  that doesn't  want to  buy it  don't  but don't  make people  stop doing  things  come on down  to building  19  we got  nigger pants  we got  the nigger  pants  and chink  glasses  they widen  your eyes  if your eyes  are slitty  like those 
[03:14:00]  gooks  come on down  and get  your nigger  pants  we got  fag  underwear  it's got  the hole  in the front  and the back  easy access  we have  faggot  coats  well we got  names coming  in for these  t-shirts  Joe and  Jersey  Joe  yeah I think  they should  call the  white beaters  the she fell  down the steps  t-shirt  alright that  could cover it  up  I walked  into a  door  tee  place a 
[03:14:30]  phone book  on her  back  tee  let's go  to Danny  from Jersey  Danny  Danny come  on  Professor  Anthony  yes sir  you omitted  the fact  or maybe  perhaps  don't know  that the  term originated  from Marlon  Brando's portrayal  in Streetcar  Named Desire  oh really  yeah  that movie  came out  he wore  that t-shirt  the whole time  he was abusive  to his wife  and the sister 
[03:15:00]  in law  and the term  came out  of that  wife  beater  yeah  alright  that makes it  even more  exciting  watch an episode  of cops  you see the guy  wearing that  comes out of the  trailer  god damn bitch  won't let me  this is my  god damn home  this is my  god damn home  he's got the  guinea tea on  and he's beating  his wife  she's got the  big black eye  telling him  I'm sorry  baby  they don't  understand  when you call  the cops  and the wife's  got a black eye  someone's getting  arrested  they think the  cops are just  going to come 
[03:15:30]  and sort their  shit out  and leave  and it's something  about women  and I think  a lot of times  like when people  argue about racism  and all that  bullshit  it's just like  are you trying  to take  does taking away  the fact  that you can  say wife  beater  take away  the fact  that a  motherfucker  like a  motherfucker  who don't  beat his  wife  would more  likely  whoop her  ass  now that he  wore the  wife  beater  and someone  who didn't  doesn't  make your  mind  that's what  pisses me  off  that lady  was just  saying  pretty much  that  I don't  want  anything  for free  like if  you're racist  I want you 
[03:16:00]  to stay  racist  don't be  not  because  motherfuckers  because you're  too pussy  to be racist  it's symbolism  over substance  they call it  the symbol  of it  is more  important  than the  actual  deal  that's  happening  and it's  easier  to address  the symbol  and get  rid of it  than it is  to address  the situation  of actual  wives being  beaten  and take  care of  that issue  let's go  back to  the news  story  here  lampooned  in the  circulars  building  19's  jerry  ellis  took  the  criticism  seriously  they were 
[03:16:30]  right  it was  awful  and I'm  sorry  it  happened  emails  have come  in  to the  discounters  hingham  headquarters  where  everyone  from  ellis  to  the  artist  was  apologetic  a slaying  expression  a street  expression  but we  should have  known better  not to  use it  I'm  supposed  to read  every word  and sometimes  it's busy  or I'm lazy  or whatever  I don't get it  so it escaped  and we are  working on a  retraction  ellis did give us  a sneak peek 
[03:17:00]  at what that  retraction  will look like  guns seem  appropriate  fence is  great  that guy  he is so  scared  he was  the most  apologetic  motherfucker  I ever  heard  I wish  once  just once  if I had  some kind  of wish  three wishes  one of them  would be  to be  the head  of some  huge corporation  maybe  the light  company  coca-cola  pepsi col  or something  huge  just  and just  do something  like that  do a thing  like  hey  all you 
[03:17:30]  faggots  if you're  thirsty  drink  diet  faggot  drink  and if  they  and it's  just to  see  if they  can really  make a dent  in my thing  like if  they go  if some  chick  or somebody  this is bad  don't say  this  don't say  white beaters  and I just  don't apologize  pursue it  shut up  bitch  we're gonna  put white  beaters  I don't  change it  into  children  kickers  if you  open your  stupid  mouth  and it's  like  and see  if the  company  goes broke  just to  see  what  really  fucking 
[03:18:00]  happens  you know  for a couple  of days  people  will probably  be like  I'm not  buying  coca-cola  products  fuck that  I'm never  again  buying  and then  like a couple  of days  they go  coca-cola  is so tasty  and cold  right  fucking squirt  fucking  hawaiian  hawaiian  punch  they gotta  give up  everything  you know  I just want  you know  some trees  this is good  so just to  you know  take that thought  and run with it  you know  when we did  the sex with  Sam thing  right  we had an  article recently  and we were  talking about  and we talked  about it  different  we're like  could you  imagine if  the company  put us back  on the air  after all that  attention we got 
[03:18:30]  for the sex  thing  the protesters  would have been  all over the  building  yes  but eventually  they would have  went home  and then ratings  through the roof  and then the ratings  would have been  so ridiculous  and they're all  about making money  you know  if you do radio  for a company  they just want  to make money  right  the ratings  Anthony and I  would have got  the amount  of money  they could have  you know  charged for an ad  it would have  been unbelievable  just like you said  I'm looking forward  to the day  that someone  has the balls  where a jock  or somebody  fucks up really bad  maybe even on TV 
[03:19:00]  and just says  you know what  fuck it  we're going to  support this guy  all the way  to see what  really would happen  because in the  corporate minds  they get so paranoid  like their whole  company is going  to go down  because of one thing  I don't think  that would happen  and then they play it  and they make believe  well morally  it was wrong  and blah blah  and that's why  we're firing  that's not why  they're firing us  they're scared shitless  that the whole  fucking company  is going to collapse  they don't give a shit  about the moral part  of what we did  why would Coca-Cola  like the people  on top of Coca-Cola  give a fuck  like just sit in the 
[03:19:30]  meeting they go  well there's a  there's a woman  from Sheboygan  who didn't like  the ad  they thought it was  and they just go  we don't give a fuck  and then announces  on TV  listen  people  there's some people  one person complaining  represents about  a hundred thousand  people complaining  you know what  we're Coca-Cola  motherfucker  goodbye  thank you  billions worldwide  fuck you  I would love for once  just to see how it would  play out  instead of like  they get  just get rid of the  person immediately  nobody could shut  no interest group  could shut down 
[03:20:00]  Coca-Cola  you know what  cigarettes  zillion dollar business  they are required  to put on this thing  they can't even put  made cars anymore  they have to say  in Canada  they put dead babies  on the fucking thing  we're required to put  a dead baby  on the fucking pack  you know what  our product kills you  I'm smoking  our product  destroys you  our product kills you  wait who's saying that  the people that are  putting the product out  you see the truth  advertisement  and it's like  one and two  this guy  has low self esteem 
[03:20:30]  or the sitcom one  where it's like  this is really going on  behind the scenes  we are  you know  hey do you know that  fucking  black people are too stupid  to know  we're gonna make  chicken flavored cigarettes  here's a memo  that was an actual memo  but  it's like  who  who actually got  fucking shut down  there's some motherfucker  in Philip Morris  right now going  chicken flavored cigarettes  motherfucker  you can shut  the career down  you can't shut down  Coca-Cola 
[03:21:00]  no  so it's like  building 19  has been around  forever  and this one  housewife who goes  I think it's  and if the guy goes  look bitch  that's what they call it  I wanna sell it  I'm not gonna say  hey come down  and buy  crew necks  if they fucking  if crew necks were called  fucking  punch you in the faces  and it had a ring to it  put it like that  he should've been like  oh tell that dumb bitch  to shut up  she doesn't even  wear white beads  but I'm sick of  I'm sick of the paranoia  that takes over 
[03:21:30]  it's like just play it out  for once  like every year  with the American Idol  there's somebody  that is in some kind  of you know  trouble  so they're like  oh we can't have him  on TV anymore  throw him off  he's been arrested  or she was in a magazine  let it play out  yeah  and see what really  would happen  nothing would happen  nothing  they get so scared  god I'm so glad  you brought that up today  nothing  like these dummies  and they're gonna  they fired us  and made believe  it was about morals  and stuff  it wasn't about morals  they were paranoid  we were gonna take down  a billion dollar  fucking business  and I say today  that would not have happened  never  eventually the protesters 
[03:22:00]  would've went away  the fucking coverage  we got all over the world  it wasn't even nationally  it was internationally  these fuckers would've had ratings  that no one would've ever seen  in radio  but the Catholic Church  what if  somebody from  the Catholic Church  never said shit about that  that's what they  I was under the impression  that it was the Catholic Church  the Catholics  were a Catholic Church  meaning St. Pat's itself  never made a statement  it was the Catholic League  the news had a lot of people  they were walking down the street  asking people  what they thought about it 
[03:22:30]  and the news  after they asked people  what they thought about it  the people would go  I am highly offended  as a Catholic  and that's what they got  you know  like three or four sound bites  on the news  so that's who was angry  they weren't gonna do anything  I'm so glad you brought that up  and I'm not just trying  to bring us into this  because we were affected by that  but you see it all the time  out there  and for once  I would just be like  just ride it out  see what happens  that guy was so apologetic  you know what  actually  I gotta even adjust  my discussion here  the insider  Pat O'Brien 
[03:23:00]  is back on TV  talking about  everyone else's shit  he got out of rehab  and he went right back  on TV  so the insider  Marv Albert  the insider showed  they did have balls  and they put him back on  no one gives a shit  that he was doing  all that crazy shit  on the phone  he's good  he's fucking good  Marv Albert  there's no one as good  as him right now  maybe like an Al Michaels  now Al Michaels  could fucking probably  do some weird shit  and get a job still  cause he's fucking  super  he's amazing  like he's the only guy  that can just 
[03:23:30]  but the difference  OJ  alright  but the difference is  but the difference is  race is different  the difference is though  when you do fuck up  and if they do bring you back  you have to go away for a while  like Marv Albert  had to go away for a while  and slowly but surely  slowly but surely  they gave him his stuff back  you know  Pat O'Brien  he's gonna go to rehab  for a little while  but I'm talking about  you fuck up  you're in the headlines  boom  keep him on the air  immediately  and see what really  would happen  just to see what happens  and he makes a statement  hi this is Marv Albert  boy I like dressing up 
[03:24:00]  in panties  yeah  now  I'll bite a bitch's ass  look at Nate Robinson  jump that little nigga  after the sex tapes  if they put Pat O'Brien  back on the insider  the ratings they would've got  day in and day out  would've been  through the fucking roof  but if they just  tell somebody to shut the fuck  shut the fuck up  but it has to be  some research  behind it  that makes them  fear  people on that level  like the fear  of that  it has to be  something that actually  can happen  nah it's the guys 
[03:24:30]  in the offices  way upstairs  the corporate guys  just get paranoid  they don't do research  it's like  just an inkling  that their cushy job  is done  fuck that  get rid of him  oh that's all it is  there's no fucking research  and stop with the  you know morally  it was blah blah blah  stop  we all know that's bullshit  yeah I don't buy that shit  they don't care  they tell the same  offensive jokes  in the boardrooms  they're throwing around  fucking shit  they're beating their wives  by the way  it doesn't matter  there's a guy outside  for American Mess  and you know  he's been sitting out  there for like two hours 
[03:25:00]  yeah  there's a reason  he's sitting out there  for two hours  you know  he looks like  Scott Peterson  yes  and that's why  he came in today  but this is radio  it's not a TV show  and  yeah  I don't even  hey  what's up bro  what's your name  what's up  Mike  hey Mike  you look just like  Scott Peterson  a little bit there  yeah I can see it  and that's why you're here  yeah and I got a  couple things for you guys  he's got a burlap bag  that's kind of scary  did Poe check the burlap bag  yes he did  because I did have a discussion  about Poe  I just remember this  as I saw the burlap bag 
[03:25:30]  yeah  Poe confiscated a stun gun  and a very serious knife today  oh today  yes  and  right  and we know what was in  about an hour ago  so  Poe earned his keep today  a stun gun huh  nice  was it a good stun gun there  Poe  yeah it's  it can knock down  probably Patrice  yeah  pretty decent  it was not mine  my heart can't take that shit  man you don't want no stun gun  use that if I fucking  have a heart attack  just kind of re  re-zap you 
[03:26:00]  it kind of was like  the one the guy took  to his handbag  oh yeah okay  but  oh it was yours  no no no  it's the one that came with me  you brought it  why would you bring a stun gun  were you gonna do something  with the stun gun  he didn't realize  he didn't realize  you know  anyway  I brought the  the sack  and I didn't realize  Jimmy wasn't gonna be here  I should have figured  because he was in Albany  uh huh  and uh  brought him some  under pads  for his little fetish problem  uh oh  so he didn't have to use  plastic sheets 
[03:26:30]  oh we could lay that out  we could lay that out  underneath him  and have a chick piss on him  and piss or shit  or do whatever he wants  well it's very uh  well we'll keep it  we'll keep it  and we'll give it to him  on Monday  just uh  very nice of you  give that to him  if you would please  and uh  have a little something  for Ant  even though I don't  think you do use this  this is uh  oh boy  what's in the bag  what's in the bag  mysitrol  which is better than Purell  I'm in medical supplies  and it has a  medical supplies  an emulsifier  that does not  dry out your hands  and it smells wonderful
