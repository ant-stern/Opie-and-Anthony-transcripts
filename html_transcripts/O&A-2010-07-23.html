<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly off course.  It began with a discussion of one host's near-accidental shooting incident with a housemate, followed by a news story about a police officer who baked marijuana brownies from confiscated evidence, leading to a 911 call.  This segued into a discussion of Charlie Rangel’s ethics troubles and Mayor Bloomberg's hot dog photo op, and a bizarre news clip showing a large cockroach crawling behind a news anchor.

A significant portion of the show was dominated by Matt from Florida, a caller under the influence of hallucinogenic mushrooms, who engaged in a profanity-laced, aggressive argument with other callers and the hosts.  This was interspersed with numerous other callers recounting their own experiences with various drugs, both positive and negative.  Anecdotes about bad drug trips were a recurring theme.  This segment also included discussion of Rich Voss's extensive and painful dental work, his hypochondria (triggered by a runny nose, leading to a hilarious WebMD self-diagnosis session and a call to Dr. Steve), and his dislike of wearing headphones during the show.  The conversation also touched upon Voss's experiences at the Montreal Comedy Festival, including a funny anecdote involving a pretzel-serving girl he made cry.

The generational technological divide between the hosts and Rich Voss was a central theme, highlighted by Voss's outdated methods of bill paying (checks and index cards) and sending thank-you notes (physical mail).  His unconventional financial strategies, including investing in foreign currency based on speculation of a US economic collapse, were also ridiculed. Voss shared personal anecdotes about his childhood, including his racist grandparents, a home robbery, and other difficult experiences. The hosts used Google Maps street view to explore Voss's old neighborhood, leading to further humorous and sometimes shocking revelations about his past, including a neighbor who died while masturbating in a bag. This segment concluded with the hosts giving Voss a free XM radio subscription.

A caller’s bizarre interaction with a carnival worker about a slide led to a discussion about Hitler and the Autobahn, filled with offensive jokes about the Holocaust.  This transitioned into a critique of Rich Voss's reaction to an offensive song parody, prompting a debate about offensive material and appropriate responses, particularly given Voss's Jewish heritage.  The show further delved into discussions about Voss’s relationship with his ex-wife, numerous callers’ penis-related concerns (leading to a medical segment with Dr. Steve), the hosts’ dysfunctional childhoods, and the potential risks of blowjobs.  Steve from Bayshore and Joe in Jersey were among the callers participating in this chaotic segment. Dr. Steve also fielded numerous calls throughout the show.

Another segment started with a caller’s question about herpes transmission and whether age could be transmitted via mosquito bites.  This led to discussions about dengue fever, bed bugs, and a graphically described pilonidal cyst.  The conversation remained extremely vulgar, focusing on bodily functions and the disgusting aspects of various medical conditions. Rich Voss participated in this segment before leaving for a dentist appointment.  The segment concluded with promotion of Dr. Steve’s website (drsteve.com) and his show, “Weird Medicine,”  along with plans for a future collaboration on a segment called "What the Hell is That?".  Audio clips of Mel Gibson's infamous rant and Bob Kelly's rapping were also played at various points during the broadcast.

[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony are no strangers to scandals  Opie and Anthony on Satellite Radio  Controversial team  Opie and Anthony apologizing for yet another raunchy  Is this the last straw for the raunchy radio?  Yee-haw!  Yeah, come on, bring it on  You know what, I think this is hilarious  A whole big bunch of fun  The greatest show on Satellite Radio today  This show is like the box of chocolates  That Forrest's mother was talking about 
[00:00:30]  You're a no-good son-of-a-bitch  Bob, you mother-fuck  We're so much fucking better than you  Absolute lunacy  If you're giving me the hook, fine, whatever  What's going on?  I do what I'm told  I'm completely out of control  It doesn't get better than this  Come on, it's shocking  Enough of this palaver  Let's get the show on the road  Total re-  Re-calling  Morning, welcome to the Opie and Anthony show  Yes 
[00:01:00]  Nice  Right on the brink of the weekend  It's right there, brother  It's right there  Love it  Look at it, it's right to your right  You know  Let's get the fuck out of here  It's just creeping down the hallway  Who's sick today?  Who's sick today?  Almost there  I'm a little congested  Ooh, feel a little something in my throat  I'm a little congested  Boy, I hope I can make it to ten today  Oh, man, I got the sniffles  What's going on with you, brother? 
[00:01:30]  I had a pretty fucking dull day  A dull day  A dull day yesterday  Yeah  Sleeping  Almost shot Danny  Really?  That's not a dull day, is it?  No, I didn't even come close  It's more than a dull day  What happened?  At the range or something?  No, I was crapped out in my house, you know  Just kind of snoozing on the couch 
[00:02:00]  Spitting a few weapons in your hand and one went off?  I mean, what do you mean you almost shot Danny?  Well, I got my sidearm there  But, you know, when I'm laying down on the couch  I take it off and I pop it up on the table next to the couch  And I fell asleep  Fell asleep  And then I get a phone call  So I'm talking on the phone  And I'm looking at my basement door 
[00:02:30]  Which I could see from my couch there  And it's open to crack  Aw, shit  Who's in my house?  I'm like, what?  And then I see it slowly start opening  And I see a figure start coming up the stairs  And I, like, I was taken aback for a second  And then I realized that it was indeed Danny  But I left a note that said in the basement, don't shoot  People have to leave notes that say don't shoot  That's crazy 
[00:03:00]  I can't tell you how many times I've come in through the yard  Just like with my hands up  Because it's kind of the safest way to do that  Because after this, you know, Anne invited me by  So I come over and I see him passed out  I don't want to wake him or nothing  So I go around back  And made my way inside all tiptoey-like  But I knew that I had to leave some kind of a note  Because there is a very real possibility of being shot in the chest  Well, he's going to protect his home, right? 
[00:03:30]  But he should have taped it, like, to my brim of my hat or something  And I was thinking that, too  Like, leaving it, like, on your chest or something  But then I was like, well, what's worse?  You know?  Like, creeping over and then, like, right as I'm, like, hovering above you  Open my eyes  I just don't feel like dealing with that  Did you lead with your beer when you were leaving the basement?  Yes, he was leading with a beer  You were leading with a beer that might help a little bit  No, I  How many people could come and go at your house at this point?

Yeah  His chick is in Spain  Getting fucking unclipped  Spanish fucking  Favuzla cock  Running of the bulls  Bullhorn cock 
[00:27:30]  Upper fucking asshole  Yeah, maybe he lives off his chick  Or his rich parents  He was able to rattle off some stuff  I heard some repetition after a while  But we did give him a lot of people  To talk to  So, you know  I think he did a good job  He done good  He turned me around  I fucking was  I would have hung up on him  In the first two seconds  But he turned me around  I figure what the hell  It's nice and early  Yeah, fuck it  Hey, now I want to see 
[00:28:00]  The cockroach footage  Yeah, that was funny shit  Because I was distracted by Matt  Now, was that a story  Of them commenting on the cockroach?  Or were they  No  Talking to her  It looked like they cropped  The video  So you didn't see the cockroach anymore  Yeah  Why can't you acknowledge  That holy shit  There's a huge cockroach  Climbing up the wall behind you  Tell her to turn around  Excuse me  There's a cockroach behind you  Oh  Anybody else see that  And do they hear the audio  Because now I need to know more about it  Yeah, if they're talking about  Cockroach  You got it 
[00:28:30]  You got to point out the cockroach  La coqueracha  La coqueracha  Shirley Sherrod, right?  Yes  Shirley Sherrod  Good old Shirley Sherrod  A lot of controversy there  A lot of people saying too  Hey, why didn't we talk about it?  uh it could have ripped her apart at first and then we would have looked silly  oh really yeah apparently she uh didn't quite say what it was edited to look like what she said but  she's talking about uh the past and how she overcame certain things but truth of the matter 
[00:29:00]  is i guess she was a racist a few years back so fuck it so they got her anyway yeah but then you  know she turned things around i guess and became like a a good uh woman there uh who's going to  help everybody she was a little prejudiced though that a few years back when she was kind of a  community organizer person like obama used to be and she was supposed to be helping out uh farmers  and there was a white farmer and she wasn't going to help him but then she realized her mistake 
[00:29:30]  because it isn't about color it's about poverty and she realized that um but she's got a racist  background i guess years and years ago doesn't everyone um background background foreground  current ground and uh in that vein too old good old new york's charlie wrangle in a little bit of  trouble with the ethics committee and uh they're gonna they're gonna charge him and he says bring 
[00:30:00]  it on that's good charlie wrangle's been in trouble forever and he's constantly using the race card so  can't wait to see how this one pans out um i'm a big fan of our politicians they're just terrific  people all around they're always fun just watching the corruption and bullshit and lying and did you  pocket pocket stuffing of our cash and did you see the bullshit photo op that our dumb mayor had the  other day in front of a hot dog mayor bloomberg mayor bloomberg who's a billionaire uh who was it was 
[00:30:30]  it the british prime minister they were having a hot dog in front of a um one of those vending carts was  bloomberg on his knees eating the hot dog like uh he's used to what i'm just saying perhaps the  guy likes eating a hot dog on his knees what uh they're having a hot dog in front of this vending  machine it's a it's it looks like a nice photo op it's a nice new york moment so i put some relish on  it and realized it had a face i took a bite out of it and it started screaming 
[00:31:00]  and the english prime minister said nah it's cool  you know in honor of matt we might have to play that today  i know we played it recently but what the hell we might have to play hot dog girl damn crazy  hippie bitch  can't handle her trip no nothing worse than someone that can't handle their fucking trip 
[00:31:30]  figure it out just fucking get a hold of yourself it happens to the best of us  whatever you had a bad trip maybe you're on a bad trip yes very bad uh very bad yeah i started  freaking out once i dropped some acid when i was like 16 a real freak out like yeah because i it  was just like it was weird like i was hanging out with people that like they weren't my friends  they were like friends of friends so like i kind of i was feeling alone anyway familiar territory  yeah like i was in a different neighborhood everything was weird i used to have like 
[00:32:00]  a really big like ridiculous hair that i dyed different colors and it was like some kind of  orange or yellow and i kept freaking out thinking my hair was on fire and i had no idea where i was  but i decided like 2 a.m i was gonna walk home you know and what was like what was the freak out  part like how did you feel um i just like i kept grabbing my head like every two seconds and then  obviously everybody starts staring at me like what are you doing you know and then i'm telling people  that i keep thinking my hair is on fire and then they start so they're pointing and laughing which 
[00:32:30]  isn't helping the situation doesn't help no no i guess as far as bad trips go it wasn't it could  have been a hell of a lot worse because people end up like in the fetal position crying and  you gotta talk them down i watched a friend of mine uh one time we decided to drop acid and go  to shea stadium for some reason that's good seeing that vast ocean of people doesn't freak  out enough uh i thought it was pretty cool but a friend of mine started to freak out a little bit  and on the way home i guess he carried like a knife in his pocket for some reason i guess for  defense or whatever and uh we're walking back home and he sees a dead cat on the floor but i guess 
[00:33:00]  in his head he saw his friend steve which was standing right next to us yeah meow but he goes and he  just a whole night goes oh my god i killed steve what am i gonna do and he's like freaking out  and it wasn't like a bit because it went on for hours and we had to tell him like you didn't kill  anybody he's right here and i think he started you know sticking his fingers down his throat to try to  make himself throw up yeah that ain't gonna work once it hits you it's over it's over johnny that was  a bad time it's in your system i think i ever had a bad trip i was on the brink of a bad trip and i 
[00:33:30]  could i was able to get rationalized like all right look fucked up shit it's supposed to do this  only you could rationalize just relax yourself in the middle of a trip that's easier to do on  mushrooms than it is on acid though yeah because mushrooms you could actually you can do that and  say hey man you're just bugging out because you took some mushrooms it's totally cool shit you got a  weird uh fucking medication acid is different acid is like this is never ending yeah this is the way 
[00:34:00]  you're gonna be forever forever this is eternity do i have stitches that's how you end up  i don't fucking crazy all right on man kevin from connecticut i watched a jar of mayo melt for 45  minutes yeah wow see that's a cool trip that's fucking groovy why not uh matt is back uh quickly  matt what did you want to say because we're moving on now i'm just saying my phone uh died i

[00:38:00]  youth weed was something i couldn't talk myself out of because it just kept like building i would get  really paranoid i was able to immerse myself in situations that i wasn't in and i would just think  about like bad things and i couldn't get them out of my head and it would like ah i'd end up like i  just gotta get in the shower like i'd always have to take a shower just thinking the water sensation  will make me forget something and then you're just like in the shower and the shower's freaking out

[00:39:00]  like the hull is gonna just implode right on me claustrophobic and i was so claustrophobic  i ended up in my bed in my bedroom uh uh just curled up shaking and and i was like i'm never  smoking weed again how long does that last two days three days i'm like maybe a week yeah how long  does weed last in your system like while you're still stoned maybe an hour but i'm saying so an

[00:47:30]  and see jason like  peeking out from behind all these trees  and shit every time he turned around  i kind of freaked you out a little bit  not too freaky  well  well if you remember how  those movies now are stupid  but you know like  parasite 3d  stupid  those were fucking scary  yep  they really were  yep  scary all right  uh let's go to matt  in minnesota  matt or michigan  where are you matt  i'm in uh michigan 
[00:48:00]  right on what do you got buddy  uh the uh the clip you guys just played  from the dearborn uh cop  uh he's actually uh  one of my former mma trainers  oh yeah  and uh every time i get in the ring  they uh play the  we used to say those drops  oh time's going by so slow man  that was awesome  but he's an mma trainer  i don't think he appreciates that  and you know he's gonna fuck you up  no  no not really  he just uh told us to uh  he'd get a little laugh out of it too  right on 
[00:48:30]  yeah that's a very funny clip  yeah it is  uh thank you sir  let's go to jimmy james  new hampshire  jimmy james  morning boys  what up jj  morning  hey uh i went to college  up in upstate new england  so i  had plenty of opportunity  tripping  uh  well i  we i used  we tripped one time  and uh it was me and my buddy  tripping  and two other meatheads  in the car  who never tripped  and one of the  non-tripping meatheads  decided at one point 
[00:49:00]  to go  imagine if we got in a car accident  and all of us died  except for greg  who was the kid  that was tripping  he fucking  lost his shit  so bad  he forgot  he forgot  who he were  he forgot  who he was  he was  i had to take him back  to my room  and he was laying in my bed  for approximately  six hours  and we just had to sit there  talking him down  it was the worst thing ever  that's a fucked up thing to say  yeah you just can imagine that 
[00:49:30]  well i got another  another quick one for you  sure  i was tripping  and uh  my uh  my parents called  you know  and you know  it's a normal rule  in the house  that if  you know  you're tripping  you don't answer phone calls  well somebody decided  to give me the phone anyway  so i figured  i was holding it together  i told them  i got on a conversation  where they'd uh  do most of the talking  started talking about  my grandmother  and somehow  it turned to money  and uh 
[00:50:00]  i thought i was doing well  until somewhere  in the conversation  my mom just went  james  what the hell  are you talking about  deluges  sort of  i wish i  i wish i had that clip  i wish i had that clip  from fargo  so  end of story  wow  i suck yam  that was  terrible  i swear to you  i was waiting  for the second part  of that 
[00:50:30]  that was so bad  they lost more  but that silence  was so uncomfortable  i just  deafening  you know what i love  let's break down  jj's call  the first part of your call  was terrific man  yeah yeah  and it had a nice out  the guy you know  was freaked out  you had to talk him down  and then you were feeling good  i know how it is  you're feeling good  you know what  i'm gonna take another shot  i can't do no wrong  today  yeah look at me  i'm part of the show today  i'm special  i'm a fucking chismop  and the only reason 
[00:51:00]  we both stopped talking  is because i really thought  there was a second part  yeah i i didn't think  the story stopped there  i thought that was a setup  to a nice punchline  or something  well my  my roommate  well  oh he's gonna try  are you trying to recover  i'm going  i'm going  i needless to say  i walked in  told everyone about it  and  when you're tripping  words don't come out  quite right  my roommate looked at me  and went  oh man you're fucked  there's nothing you can do now  at which point 
[00:51:30]  i lost it  probably would have been better  probably not  wow  i'm out  holy shit  you are really just fucking  i think you gotta change your name  if you wanna call the show again  all right jj  get out of here  pete in delaware  pete  hey man  i just wanted to tell  about a bad trip man  me and my girlfriend  went camping  i was married at the time  my wife knew about my girlfriend  but we had dropped out  a bad call  shitload ass  and shrewd man 
[00:52:00]  it just went bad  we started shitting ourselves  pissing ourselves  and we started walking  around campsite  walking around the thing  i had to call my wife  to talk us down man  and i just started like  looking at my girlfriend  i said what the fuck  am i doing with you  i got a beautiful wife man  so all them guys  you know  going out with my girlfriend  just tripping  the shit they really  want to be with  with man  because i tell you what  my wife talked me down  it was great  yeah yeah  your phone was a little rough  but basically you were  tripping with your girlfriend  and it was so bad  that you called your wife  to talk you down 
[00:52:30]  yeah yeah  and i told my girlfriend  she just sat in the car  and shit her pants  and pissed her pants  it was so bad man  i've noticed it's very  difficult for people  to really convey  a tripping story  a tripping story  they remember it one way  and then they try to talk  about it  and it just isn't really  coming out the way it should  it's coming out like shite  but look how good they look  i know  that's just it  it's like oh that's cool  and then  i just heard what you said  and i want to continue 
[00:53:00]  going  i know  because how do you not  take this phone call  smoking pot story  almost suffocated on oreos  how do you do that  we have to fucking  now i'm curious  all right good  uh darren in uh  new york darren  yeah uh  i was drunk  and started smoking  uh the night was going on  and on  i just remember  stumbling around the room  getting horrible  crazy munchies  started out a bag of oreos  and all of a sudden  all went downhill  i was sitting in bed  i remember 
[00:53:30]  there's just that  suffocating feeling  when you have oreos  you feel like you can't  breathe because your mouth  is so caked oreos  and i just  one at a time dude  really  oh i was  i was so hungry  so i  you know i'm sitting there  i remember laying in bed  and my wife comes over  and she's like  are you okay  and i was like  honey i think i'm dying  and i just  i just remember  just sitting there  in tears  because i didn't think  i was going to survive  through that night  uh horrible  ended up later  just you know 
[00:54:00]  puking everything out  and you know  the night went on  pretty normal  and once again  another night goes by  and more pot goes in  and you know  it was a  it was a great night  but definitely  you don't want to  suffocate on oreos  i would say  probably one of the  worst death experiences  you could probably have  but no one ever feels  no no  no one feels like  they're gonna  it's it's  that's like a one  and you were the one  that said that  like you know  when you're eating oreos  and you'd get that  suffocating feeling  yeah  and no one  no one went  yeah 
[00:54:30]  yeah  i know that  because your mouth  is filled with oreos  i i thought everyone  has that feeling  at some point  in their life  when they're smoking pot  no but you  you kind of referenced it  like when you're just  eating oreos regularly  well i guess you know  on a good day  if i'm really eating oreos  regularly i'm probably  going to feel like  i'm suffocating too  sometimes  jesus christ  all right  thank you darren  thanks  you're so right  i know  they just  they can't convey it  but see this guy  tripped at  teletubbies 
[00:55:00]  attacked him  from the tv  that's  all right  you see that  sounds freaky  you want to go with it  or you want to go with  friend got so drunk  he lost all motor control  he's never seen a guy  in so much pain  the next day  you gotta take a call  like that  of course  all right  let's try it  let's try  well let's give it a try  if this one bombs  we're done  there's ten more  standing by here  yeah  larry arizona  hello bubble boys  hey man  hello  i was stationed in  massachusetts a second  time and my roommate  was getting kicked out  of the army  and we went to a  strip joint  well i went to a

[00:59:00]  mad  god damn  kids  i don't even  know if he  knew he  was an  older guy  so i  don't even  knew if  you knew  what was  really going  on  probably thought  he was  having a  stroke  did he come  back the next day  yeah  did he talk  about it  no one got  in trouble  nothing  no it was  real kind of  just between  a couple of  friends that  this happened  because everybody  was sort of  paranoid that  some you know  you could get  in a lot of  trouble for dosing  your teacher's  drink  i don't think  that would be  good no matter  what year you  went to school  yeah  all right  you want the  hot dog  lady story 
[00:59:30]  that'll wrap up  our first hour  yes  it's either that  or drinking out  of cups  well this this  woman is uh  she's having a  bad trip  yeah  a bad trip  man  is this a  psa i don't  even know  i think i don't  even know where  this came from  i know it's old  though  real old  this is from  the 70s  yeah man  we found this  many many years  ago check this  out opie and  anthony  i first dropped  acid when i was  18 i was over  at these people's  house one night  this guy i went 
[01:00:00]  to school with  was over there  and asked me if  i wanted to try  some acid  i had read about  it in the  newspapers and  heard a few  friends talk  about it so i  was curious i was  pretty jacked up on  marijuana so i  decided to try it  and i dropped it  i don't know what i  was waiting for a  flash or a rush or  whatever but i kept  sitting there waiting  and waiting and  nothing was happening  so i got up and  then went to the  dresser and put on a  pair of pink capris and  a green and brown  blouse i thought the 
[01:00:30]  colors were beautiful  so we tripped down to  market street and i  decided to buy a hot  dog  i was very hungry and  i had put mustard and  ketchup and relish in the  usual and i put the hot  dog up to my mouth and  somebody started screaming  i didn't know what was 
[01:01:00]  happening so i looked up  at my friend terry and  said did you hear that  didn't you hear someone  scream he said no i got  the hot dog up to my  mouth again and i was  ready to bite and the  scream got louder  and it hit me no it  couldn't be and i looked  down at the hot dog and  there was a face on him  eyes nose a mouth i had 
[01:01:30]  put the ketchup to where  it looked like his hair  and he started telling me  that i couldn't eat him  and he had a wife and  seven kids at home to  support and i stood there  with this hot dog and  asked terry do you know  this hot dog is talking  to me and he says nah  let's get out of here he  thought i was just faking  and i told him look at  the thing he's got a face  and he's screaming and 
[01:02:00]  the guy finally looked over  and he got on the same  trip that i was on and we  sat there carrying on a  conversation with that  hot dog finally i decided i  was just hallucinating so i  put it in my mouth and bit  down it screamed so loud  that you could hear it all  over town so i had to throw  it on the ground and step  on it and i was jumping on 
[01:02:30]  this hot dog in the middle of  market street  i realized that i had murdered it  and i took off screaming down  the street scared  the opie and anthony show is 
[01:03:00]  now is now back on the virus  sirius xm  let's welcome rich voss to the  radio show rich how are you  on kids it's been a while i was  thinking that is it well the last  time i was here is with uh when  when colin was here you don't like  the headphones no not unless you  get callers what do you need 
[01:03:30]  headphones for well you sound better  that way like everybody kind of  saying and then you know if you're  off mic and start drifting off mic  like this you go ah  and then you're back on all right  well once i start drifting i'll put  those back on all right because  you know you know what i'm saying  i hear you you're huh you're  over modulating now i have to do all  the work thanks rich oh now i'll  adjust over here yeah how would i  know the difference even listening to  myself because my fucking  sounds like this like anthony said 
[01:04:00]  because if you have the headphones on  and all of a sudden you're talking  like this you're like oh i'm talking  like this so i better back up a  little bit and then like anthony  said  see it doesn't matter stupid pay  systems in new york what see and you  don't you can't hear us because we're  still doing a bit and no you stop and  you're jumping in you you probably  you stopped you did your uh yeah the 
[01:04:30]  subway put the headphones on please  you've done a million appearances on  our show with headphones and all of a  sudden you're going to change now  don't change now right well see  because my hair looks good you guys  have nothing to lose when it doesn't  fuck your hair up like you go home to  bed after this wait where do you have  to go after this the dentist yeah your  hair your hair has to look good for  the dentist that's a good point no it  doesn't you're right so i can wear the  head because the headphones i go home  with horrendous hair every day and but  don't you get earaches sometimes yes if  we do a very long break and i take the 
[01:05:00]  headphones off my ear hurts and they're  red yeah yeah you're absolutely right  you know what tinnitus we've been doing  radio a really long time they can't get  better fucking headphones in this and  it's not even the company's fault this  is the best they they offer with this  dumb bar that goes across your fucking  the top of your head and sometimes that  hurts well yeah you ever watch golf  tournaments and they had the ones with  the mic standing out and the headphones  and the mic is in front of their face  yeah i think a television would have  something even better than that you 
[01:05:30]  know what i mean yeah well you know  there's just something about having a  mic though in front of you you could  use it dynamically more than something  in your in front of your face like i  never liked that that they have that  little thing yeah but i never liked  that like for radio yeah we made they  would offered us that like no we made  times we actually used them once and it  was horrendous we did a live broadcast  with 10 of our comedian friends you might  have even been there rich i'm not really  sure and everyone had them so everyone  soon as everyone was talking at the 
[01:06:00]  exact same volume at the exact same time  yeah you can't pull the mic away and be  like yeah yeah yeah like real quick or  you can't do that  yeah  thank you al you got  these are jokes laugh it's very physical  sometimes radio is very physical right  what a way to start the morning off  you know that's a great little bit he  does i was  he usually does that when he's talking 
[01:06:30]  about kids  do the kid version of that amp please  which one was that when they don't like  when the kids just like running back and  forth  that's that's why you two have a radio  show and i don't when you do things like  that that's right i know the way to work  the dynamic of the microphone to paint a  picture with words and sound  are you really going back to the dentist  yeah i got like two more visits and then i 
[01:07:00]  get my uh final teeth  it's like final cut  come on two two years of this fucking  nightmare and thirty three thousand  dollars later and then i'll have uh uh  uh dr holden will put my teeth in and  goddessman did all the uh fucking all the  surgery and all that's done everything  is twisted in all the implants now  there's a post-traumatic stress disorder  you know it's like going to war you know  they've been going to war they've been  there forever with your mouth oh yeah 
[01:07:30]  yeah yeah it's been a lot come on  it's been a lot of work i'm sorry i don't  i don't they've been in your mouth more  than longer than we've been in iraq  you know what's fucked up about radio and  being a comic i think it was two weeks or  a week a couple weeks i was doing a call  in to uh and these guys are good they're  down in florida zito and garrett or  whatever and i call them all the time and 
[01:08:00]  i i rolled out of bed and i might even  have said this to you guys uh and i was up  for 10 fucking minutes so i get on you  know 10 minutes i'm and i call in and  it's going okay you know and they go  wow you're not as funny today and then  it hit me they said that well because  we i've called many times there's an  honesty there yeah yeah they go what's  going on and i go i got up 10 minutes  ago you know and the thing is as a cop  you know if you were getting ready to  have root canal or heart surgery and  your fucking dentist just woke up 10  minutes ago i don't think you would 
[01:08:30]  really fucking let him do it still a  little groggy yeah but but not a comic  you know what i mean i've talked about  that a lot of times you comics are in a  bad spot because yet you you're expected  to be funny wherever you go whenever  you're doing press or this and that  everyone just expects rich voss be funny  yeah now you're on sometimes you don't  feel like being funny you know you never  ask an actor okay let's do a scene you  know uh what i'm saying so it's always 
[01:09:00]  be funny enough already i'm fucking done  with this business  you've had it you're done  you're up there in montreal for a  couple weeks for two weeks in montreal  comedy festival last year when i did  montreal okay here what this year but i  was there for two weeks so bonnie came  up with the baby on wednesday because she  was doing a gala i did the nasty show  which was great because i got to work  with norton bobby kelly gerardo it was  just fucking sold out every night and  just is whatever you want crowds and 
[01:09:30]  shit oh they were fucking the best so  when she came out wednesday uh we needed  a babysitter so we went through the  uncle paul we went through the production  jimmy would have said something the  production company and they they go oh we  get you somebody a question and went  back and forth well anyhow last year when  i was at montreal the year before this  backstage there's a girl that does the  table all the food the pretzels like the  little craft table whatever and last  year it was horrible like the hummus was 
[01:10:00]  hard and all the and we were trashing  my god well wait you know i love how we  try to sell pretzels as this amazing  food you know well i'm leading into it  because that's what it's okay that's  going somewhere so so you know the girl  that does this with the doritos and some  dip and carrots our table last year not  this year looked horrible so we're all  smashing her while i was the breaking  point where she started crying  whatever whatever i said this girl  that's pouring fucking pretzels and

[01:21:00]  uh my nose was ruddy a little more okay  he's just farting put chronic fucking  flatulence in it pops up is that it or do  we have more that's about it i guess oh  really you're gonna be all right  call them not necessarily what the fuck  is wrong see this is why you don't do  this you could have chronic obstructive  pulmonary disease oh wow what's that no i  don't want to know doesn't sound good 
[01:21:30]  you could also have legionnaire's  disease oh shit i never even went to  war i don't even know you could have  chemical pneumonia mm-hmm viral pneumonia  mm-hmm this is why you don't do this  that's just fucking web md covering  themselves covering you know and that's  just for cough and runny nose yeah that  could be anything you could have  asbestosis oh shit mesothelioma fuck  next thing you know i'm gonna have a  pika balloon follow me around you  don't remember the pika commercials  where the little black kids were  eating paint chips how old are you 
[01:22:00]  oh my god like the pika balloon that  was a commercial you might have pika  and little black kids i'll trump you  with the rubella umbrella  now we gotta find that commercial i  gotta see that the pika balloon yeah  pika balloon for the kids that ate the  paint chips yeah you know they grew up in  the ghetto and the parents in the ghetto  in the yeah in the ghetto paint chips  again paint chips in the ghetto how is it  spelled well i'm taking see i think i 
[01:22:30]  have i think i had a sinus infection too  so i'm just taking last year i was my  doctor gave me the fucking campfire scene  and blazing saddles in here today it's  just everybody's leaning over one cheek  and farting jesus come on he gave me  antibiotics last year for sinus infection  so i'm just taking them now  do we need dr steve he's on the line i  just want to ask him a question or two  you really do okay uh dr steve we got 
[01:23:00]  rich voss in studio hey how you doing  doc all right man how are you uh okay i  you know i've kid kid a common cold last  over a week like a runny nose and stuff  absolutely matter of fact the typical  duration of a of the truly common cold  is usually thought to be two weeks but  there's a thing that's been going around  uh well it's a little bit late for it but  there was a whooping cough epidemic that 
[01:23:30]  crashed through here earlier in the year  and uh that can last up to six weeks where  you just have a hacky cough uh you'll  notice that it's uh worse when you laugh  you know you'll just start coughing and  coughing well that's not going to happen  here in studio  oh good like okay so i thought maybe i  have a sinus infection  yeah but i and i had antibiotics last  year for a sinus infection  antibiotics antibiotics i said 
[01:24:00]  infections are really actually viral  antibiotics but but a lot of doctors  still you know we're over i love it  common colds with antibiotics that's bad  right doesn't it make super flus well it  doesn't make super flus but it does we  have created these uh multiply resistant  organisms by teaching them how uh what  antibiotics we would use against them you  know by exposing them to them yeah and  then they learn like yeah this is nothing  fuck it yeah yeah so we've got two big 
[01:24:30]  ones now and now there's a third one  coming out there that's great multiply  resistant staph that we've all heard  about and then there's vancomycin resistant  enterococcus and that's a bad one and  now there's this one that's called a  multiply or extremely multiply resistant  acinetobacter and there it's not sensitive  to anything wow also too when i was at in  montreal i uh when i worked out i walked  into the steam bath barefooted could i  caught something like that 
[01:25:00]  don't they get staph infections what is  that oh oh i see what you're saying uh  yeah they're like if you're working out  at a gym or something or uh you could be  at a in a sauna or something and and pick  up a skin infection you get this little uh  weird skin infections uh that can be this  multiply resistant staph the cool thing  about it is is in young otherwise healthy  people who get it it's usually just a  little skin infection it's easily treated 
[01:25:30]  so far with uh an antibiotic that you  can take by mouth called bactrim so  uh we've still got it fooled on one  front but anyway but that yeah that's  possible people who work out in gyms and  stuff can get that oh this is hilarious  i might just  i just might have some kind of like cold  because my nose has been running but  sometimes it stops and then starts again  yeah it's a cold you can just have allergies  too and allergies can cause coughing and 
[01:26:00]  can cause nasal congestion and stuff you  can get post-nasal drift to give you a  hacky cough and that can last for months  also uh there's a guy named ronnie on the  line he says uh he makes dentures for a  living yeah you got some dentures right  no i have these are not dentures okay all  right but he said you could be allergic to  that shit no maybe there's some shit in your  mouth you're allergic to now this  happened in montreal is that possible dr steve  um yeah i've heard about that the thing  is is that he's had that stuff in his  mouth for a long long time yeah but he's 
[01:26:30]  had a fucking runny nose since the nw days  no i uh no i i think when i was in  montreal doing 21 shows and i was in in  one club that had to be 120 degrees for  five hours it was fucking brutal i was  hosting two two nights there five hours a  night and leaving that heat going back  out to the weather and being by the mic and  and not sleeping you know four hours a  night you wore yourself down right i don't  know i'm gonna get blood tested again yeah 
[01:27:00]  you better he's really paranoid dr steve by  the way uh a lot of people dr steve a lot  of people pointing out dr steve they're  they're just basically writing what's cool  about staff who said yeah because then he  say what's cool about it what's cool about  it is yeah everyone's like what could  possibly be cool about staff uh i have i  can't even believe i said that it's just  must have been a vocal crutch well but  walking barefooted from like 10 feet you'd 
[01:27:30]  have to have a cut on your foot or something  to catch something right paranoia that rich  varsity was staff you know you uh you carry  staff on your skin all the time anyway  it's right there a little abrasion is  enough to get it to invade the skin so you  know that's why people in gyms get it the  other thing people in gyms can get is a  thing called herpes gladiatorum where you  know if you're uh uh uh working out a cock  in the locker room or if you're doing 
[01:28:00]  contact sports like mma or uh jiu-jitsu or  something like that you can get a herpes  anywhere on your skin it doesn't just have  to be on your genitalia or on your lips  and uh you know some people get it on  their chest or their back it's just  another risk of uh go ahead rich i'm  getting the heebie-jeebies thinking of  this every time i fuck i can't talk i  can't talk to doctors right i love i  love listening to them because they have  so much knowledge and but now like last  time i listened to this fucking feels 
[01:28:30]  about kindergartners too yeah i didn't  know you could get herpes on your back  it's unbelievable yeah yeah the fuck  big load on your fucking back maybe i  can understand how some girls can get  get it that way what if you have a  fetish of rubbing your dick on strange  toilet seats can you  in a hut in the congo  oh see what's the worst thing you can  rub your uh cock on there dr steve 
[01:29:00]  worst thing yeah worst thing and  obviously not another sander yeah  and obviously not another human being  like if all of a sudden you just had  some weird fetish where you had to rub  your cock on everything what would be  the worst thing frunk it says another  cock sulfuric acid yes exactly there you  go you could catch something from a  toilet sheet if you're like something  here's here's the question i want to  know what is the worst what is the  worst thing you could put your dick on  or in that would happen under normal 
[01:29:30]  circumstances a toilet seat you're  smacking it against the side of the  urinal bonnie like where where would  you be more apt to pick up some type of  problem with your penis um where would  it have to go there are uh you know  toilet seats really uh are reasonably  safe um it's uh and those those pieces of  paper that people put down you know will 
[01:30:00]  protect them to a certain degree but uh  the only thing that you really could pick  up from uh toilet seat would be you know  if somebody you know rubbed they had a  herpes lesion on their dick rubbed it on  the seat and then you sat right on that  part of the seat oh perfect timing i mean  it's it would it would take something  like that and that's very unusual but  how many minutes uh you know what i mean  like the guy has to get right up or or you  know what i mean the herpes lesion can or 
[01:30:30]  the herpes virus can actually live on on  on what we call fomites which are just  inanimate objects for many hours but  again you know someone would have to have  ass lesions for you to get ass lesions  what what if somebody rubs you don't want  ass lesions by the way what if somebody  rubs your question though i think a log an  actual log like if you were taking a shit 
[01:31:00]  out in the woods and rub your uh and  you're sitting on a log there are all  kinds of these scary what are called  sacrophytic organisms that uh that uh eat  wood and stuff and then if they get on  your skin coincidence infection they can  be really nasty so don't sit on any logs  uh when you're in the woods what if that  person rubs their herpes dick on the  toilet seat could you catch anything on  your tongue absolutely you know there's 
[01:31:30]  one sick fuck out there that needs to  lick toilet seats that's his thing  get off  there's one fat looking guy with glasses  it's just his thing he just can't help  himself  you know there's one guy right now there  has to be that's licking the floor in a  peep booth  that's just  he has to he has to he can't make it 
[01:32:00]  through his day  i don't know why that's funny but  so you don't think i have tb  no it doesn't sound i mean that the way  to determine whether you have tv tv is to  do a tb test  uh you know uh they just do a skin prick uh and they look at it in 48 hours and if it's uh normal you don't have tb how about how about let's get if you still don't necessarily have tb it just means you've been exposed to it well why don't we get real with rich voss i notice he's uh chewing nicotine gum still yeah how many years uh rich four he's been chewing nicotine gum for four years now tell him what he could get for from doing no don't please don't why we got to get that fucking gum out of your mouth it's better than six 
[01:32:30]  smoking cigarettes because each each uh gum has four milligrams of nicotine so say i do  ten a day that's 40 milligrams of nicotine  rationalize it  when i used to smoke  how many cigarettes would that be  when i smoked a cigarette has nine milligrams 
[01:33:00]  so it's about  four and a half  look at what rich can do when he has to  well listen  he's like fucking  michu kaku  i used to smoke  i used to smoke  three packs a day  here i used to smoke  three packs a day  which is 60 cigarettes a day  times nine milligrams  is 540 milligrams a day  i used to have  compared to 40  oh he's rationalized this  he's completely rationalized  and he knows the math and everything  now here's the reality  dr steve what could he get from  continuing to chew the nicotine gum 
[01:33:30]  well here's the thing  he  rich you're absolutely right  chewing is by far  way better  okay  way way way better  because you're not getting  exposed to the carbon monoxide  you're not getting exposed to the tar  but nicotine  of itself  is not  a safe  a safe drug  because it causes  constriction of the blood vessels  so  the first thing that it can cause  and it's tapping out  oh no  oh nicotine  all right  i thought something else was dangerous 
[01:34:00]  i'm scared  eventually i'll quit this too  no no no he's not  he's not done  he's not done  no he's not done  go ahead dr  what are the dangers  of nicotine  lay it out  the first thing is  nicotine is the number one  cause  reversible cause  of impotence  in men over 40  i don't care  i don't care  he's like  oh i don't care  like  like that's nothing  that's nothing  i laugh at that  fuck body  fuck that  so is that fucking broad 
[01:34:30]  naked body  oh shit  i didn't care about  the cancer  and the heart disease  and all that stuff  it was when i found out  that statistic  that caused me to quit  a little impotence  all right  you know what  this was great talking to you  thank you for your help  no what about the nicotine  i gotta run and take it  i gotta go to the bathroom  so bad  oh shit  that's one of the symptoms  that's one of the symptoms  is having a  you can't control your bowels  no it's  oh my god  uh you know when you cramp  right down here  when it's gonna  just fly out  it's just gonna be perfect 
[01:35:00]  i don't have to struggle now  kenny  close the door  close the door  force him to stay in here  fuck  rich  rich  rich  that door is hanging up  and staying open now  yeah  and then we could hear  everything outside  i think it's the rug  some shit  it's whatever  tell him he can shit  when he can get past kenny  yeah he ran out of here  he ran the fuck out of here  he's gone  he ran out of here  and the reason he's gone  he doesn't want to hear  your  your  your stuff  that's why 
[01:35:30]  he just made an excuse  i'm telling you  he is  uber paranoid  and every cigarette  we were talking about  hangnails one time  and i freaked him out  so i  i know this is gonna  freak him out  how could a hangnail  uh  it was something  so innocuous like that  and then i found out  like weeks later  that it  it had bothered him  the whole time  i guess we were talking about  uh  eating peanuts  uh  causing diverticulitis  or something  i don't know  yeah that freaked him out  yeah  so  but anyway  yeah the nicotine still is not 
[01:36:00]  it's not safe  it's just safer than  smoking  sure  okay  but anyway  it  it's  it's biggest  uh  risks are  cardiovascular  you know  heart disease  stroke  and impotence  oh he is so glad  he left  he'll be so glad  he left  he doesn't want to hear that  he doesn't like that stuff  all right  why else would you quit  doing something  you quit smoking  because you're afraid  of what it's going to do to you  right  the only way to get off  the nicotine gum  is to become afraid 
[01:36:30]  of what it's going to do to him  yeah that's pretty much  the only reason  people stop doing things  why else would you quit  yeah it's great  all right sir  uh  weird medicine  next saturday night  yeah july 31st  right on  we look forward to it  thank you so much  thank you  have a great weekend  you too anytime  all right  dr steve  dr steve becoming a regular  on the show  well he's a  he's our go-to guy  whenever we need any  medical expertise  absolutely  we go to dr steve  let's take a break  or crappy wine  anything we can play

[01:38:30]  Blow me.  Because I deserve it.  Fucking blow me, bitch.  I said, I'm fucking walking you up and said, blow me.  I deserve to be blown first.  Before the fucking jacuzzi.  I'll tear it up and burn the goddamn house out.  But blow me first.  I just need a nice woman to look after my beautiful daughter.  And blow me.  You're a pain in the ass.  You're a pain in my ass.

The hell?  How'd it go for you in the bathroom, Rich?  It was insane.  Yeah.  Now, I was 30 seconds away, or maybe 15, right when I got my pants down. 
[01:39:30]  It just, it just, it was straining, like, like, come on, pants, come down.  And I don't like to do, talk about going to the bathroom, that type of humor.  Of course, it's not.  But this was the best in two weeks.  It was, like, two weeks of everything, and it just flew out.  Nice and smooth and a smooth ride.  It was unbelievable.  No turbulence.  And now I have a bowling game on my iPhone where I can bowl and do it at the same time. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah.  So it's heaven.  Yeah, but if I don't get...  Why were you giggling?  Because I was a couple minutes behind you, and I was in the bathroom, and you were just laughing to yourself in the stall.  Because I was thinking about putting that on a big newspaper and walking it in here.  Oh, jeez.  I was thinking the reaction from him going, puking and...  I just would have run out, like, so heebie-jeebie.  I just started giggling.  So heebie-jeebie.  Thinking how, what are the things I can do with this big fucking dump?  This big lump of shit. 
[01:40:30]  This piece of shit.  Are we eventually going to get old enough where we don't laugh at fucking toilet humor?  Shit jokes and stories and...  This started when I was eight, and it just continues, man.  I just don't get it.  Thinking about what you said about there is some guy that's licking or rubbing his dick onto it.  He has to do it.  That's his thing.  I would imagine we all have a thing. 
[01:41:00]  Some are whatever, and others are like, no, this is my thing.  I have to lick every time.  Me and Anne, we're talking about the hut girl and how hilarious that is.  That's so funny.  You are so...  No matter what you get here in the States, you can be like, oh, if I didn't use this, or...  There's always a little...  Am I going to catch something?  A little doubt in your head.  Like, oh, fuck, man.  But if you're fucking a girl on a hut, you absolutely have something.  Yes.  You caught something.  You're just wondering how bad it is. 
[01:41:30]  But you have something.  If you...  You walk out of a hut, you have a fucking disease.  That's a new bit I'm going to do now on stage.  Because I can't...  Here's the thing.  But what makes it...  When you pull out and you have no dick left, you know you have something.  It's a problem.  What makes it so funny is you would still have to have sex with the girl.  Yeah, yeah, you'd be like, I'll just go on a hut.  Yeah, look, man.  Maybe I'll...  I don't know.  Maybe.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a hut.  You know, sometimes hut pussy can be... 
[01:42:00]  Hut pussy.  That's one letter away from hut pussy, which is pretty much the same thing.  Oh.  Just a hut.  Hut.  That's terrible.  Too fucking good, man.  All right.  Wah-boom.  What else is up, Rich?  Did you watch...  No one cares.  Why am I going to ask you?  Did you watch him?  Fuck it.  I was going to do a golf thing, but you watched the British Open.  Yeah, a lot of it.  Fucking guys. 
[01:42:30]  That wind is...  I think...  You know Tiger's done.  You know what it is about...  You think he's done?  Not that he's done.  Because they're starting to...  A lot of people are starting to think he might be done.  No, it's not he's done.  People aren't...  He's going to win a few more, but not like he was winning in the past.  He won one of the reasons.  Besides being great, people are intimidated by him, so they got out of their game.  Oh, oh.  They're not intimidated by him anymore.  And now they're just like, ah, fuck this guy, right?  Yeah, because there's so many good new golfers.  They don't give a fuck.  You know, they're not intimidated anymore.  Yeah, there was some... 
[01:43:00]  And since his fall from grace.  And I know you're not a huge golf fan, but there was a guy playing in the British Open.  He was...  He's an Asian guy, right?  I think he's 16 or 17, and he showed up.  58.  He's 58 or 59 on a golf course back in Japan or something.  Oh, wow.  And he's not even...  Mini golf, right?  I don't even think he's 18 years old, and he's already shooting ridiculous numbers.  Well, they putt so good.  How is Tiger going to compete with all these young guns coming up?  Yeah, this little kid, this kid, Ricky Fowler, who's coming up, who's fucking good.  Orange guy.  He likes the orange hat and the orange shirt.  The puma. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  You know, there's all these...  They're not intimidated by him.  That's how, you know, a lot of boxers and karate guys win fights, because they just take  your fucking, you know, your heart just looking at him.  Yeah, yeah.  I remember when I used to fight karate tournaments, man.  I used to scare the shit out.  Oh, yeah.  I used to fight karate tournaments back in the day.  Stop it.  I'm telling you.  You're Ralph Macchio.  I'm back.  Yeah.  I waxed on.  Were you a little fucking karate guy?  I know.  My little feet would fly through the air, and...  I cannot picture that at all.  That was back in the day.  Why?  He's done karate moves for us. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  Exactly.  That's why I can't imagine.  Can you break a board right now?  Huh?  Can you break a board?  Yeah.  Do you have a balsa wood board?  What can you break right now with your skills?  What can I...  If you had to.  I don't know.  I can break the momentum of the show.  I can break...  I can break a board.  Yeah.  Fuck you.  I was a...  Look at this guy.  Well, they can.  It's a radio.  Oh.  No.  It's called the worst kung fu movie audition ever. 
[01:44:30]  It's worth checking out on YouTube.  Yeah.  Yes.  I fucking love to get all psyched here in this song.  Oh.  You like this song, Voss?  Remember this?  Right?  Yeah.  Yes.  Big montage.  This is the montage of the actual tournament.  Sweep the leg. 
[01:45:00]  That guy knocked himself out.  So we just watch some guy with nunchucks just fucking...  Try to do a flip.  Try to do a flip and he knocked his ass right out.  Oh, my God.  What is this one called?  The worst kung fu movie auditions ever.  Right.  Is he going to kick an apple off of this thing's head?  And he went right on his ass.  You need to get close.  No.  These guys suck.  Oh, look at that.  Bobby Kelly.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:45:30]  This fat guy did a tumble salt.  It wasn't even a roll.  And tried to break a board and failed miserably.  You ever watch Foot Fist Way?  I'm going to start watching this.  Have you watched it yet?  No, I have not watched that.  Danny McBride's first movie, I believe.  That's how he got discovered by Will Ferrell.  I didn't watch that one.  It's pretty damn good as far as this whole karate culture goes.  Yeah.  Taekwondo and all that.  Yeah, absolutely. 
[01:46:00]  I'm more about Gone.  There's some pretty good scenes, man.  You guys know movies.  Just a couple movies because we don't rent movies that much anymore because we watch Damages and Breaking Bad.  So what are these two movies?  What's the one with Matt Damon?  Is it part of the supremacy shit?  The new one, the Something Zone?  You know what I'm saying?  Green Zone, maybe?  Okay, okay.  Don't help them.  What?  No, I don't know what you're talking about yet.  The new Matt Damon movie that's on video. 
[01:46:30]  All right.  On video.  Or it's coming out.  I just saw the poster in front of Blockbuster.  On video?  Blockbuster.  On DVD or video.  There's not many Blockbusters.  When someone mentions Blockbuster on this show, I get really confused.  I thought they were gone.  They shut them all down in Manhattan.  And the ones you do see, they're having a massive clearance sale.  Why?  What are people doing?  Electronically delivered media?  Wait, what did you just say?  We went through this before.  Well, they're doing Netflix.  You're still going to Blockbuster to get movies? 
[01:47:00]  Oh, yeah.  You know that's very rare, right?  I'm sure there's other people listening right now that still do it.  What are you, renting it?  For the most part, no one goes to a video store anymore.  I knew it was rare.  When I walked in, they started throwing confetti and horns blue.  And they came up and handed me a prize and stuff.  Very excited.  Yes.  You know, they pointed to a car.  They had a model in there and stuff.  You actually do go in, pick a movie out, take it to the counter, and rent it.  Yeah, because I leave my house.  No, Rich.  I would love to be with you on that one, but people aren't doing that anymore. 
[01:47:30]  Is there a late fee?  Yeah.  Well, now, even better, they have those dollar machines outside 7-Eleven and different places.  He's got a point there.  The Redbox thing, it actually is, I can't imagine why, but it has kind of taken off a little bit.  Yeah?  Yeah, I mean, because I was just having this argument the other day.  It's like, they put them in, like, Pathmarks and, like, supermarkets or outside of a 7-Eleven, 
[01:48:00]  where it's like a dollar a day.  You go in, you put a dollar on, like, a vending machine, and it vends you out a DVD.  Oh, right.  Do you think I really give a fuck if you go, I have to agree?  Like, he's saying to me, like, oh, I'm with him on this one.  It doesn't matter to me.  Sorry.  Okay.  I helped you out.  No, but here's the thing.  Hey, but I want to know, like, do you have to give the DVDs back?  No, you get to keep them for a dollar.  I have a collection.  Of course you've got to give them back.  You put them right back into the fucking thing.  How many days is it?  Oh, now you're looking for help.  Now he's mad. 
[01:48:30]  Now you're looking for help.  See what you did?  I was right there with you.  There you go, you fucking idiot.  Now you're going to fucking swing out here by yourself.  No, because to me, it's the same thing.  It's like Netflix, basically.  Redbox, no, because you actually have to go to get it.  So what's the point?  Like, I don't understand how Blockbuster fails.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  Because the point is, you still have to go and get your DVD, and then you have to go and bring it back.  But here's the difference, like if you're going into the supermarket or 7-Eleven, you're walking out and you see it, you go, what the fuck, maybe I'll get a DVD.  So it's not usually premeditated. 
[01:49:00]  They're going on impulse buys.  It's more convenient.  That's fair, but you still have to go out of your way to go to Blockbuster.  But then you still have to go out of your way to bring it back.  Well, no, you just go next time you go to the Path Market.  If you remember.  To get your shitty groceries or whatever.  But it's only like $1.99 or something.  It's like $1 a day.  Yeah, it's like nothing.  Oh, so if you have it for 10 days, it's $10, that type of thing?  I think so.  You got to return it.  And dumb Bonnie, I went to return hers, and she forgot to put the DVD back into the case.  So once you put it in, you got to pay for the DVD. 
[01:49:30]  You know what I'm saying?  What?  You get the DVD.  It comes out of a fucking electronic box or whatever.  You know, ooh, box.  An electronic box.  The future.  And then you fucking, you're done with it.  You just slip it in, and then it fucking, you know, whatever, scans.  But you close it.  Once you close it and put it in, you can't get it back.  An old dummy gave it to me to bring back, but she didn't have the DVD in it. 
[01:50:00]  You know what I'm saying?  So what happens?  What happens when?  I guess they charge her credit card for a missing DVD.  Yeah.  How much would that be?  $450.  It used to be $99.  I remember if you lost your video, your VHS tape, it was $99.  $99.  For a fucking just shitty Eddie Murphy movie.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  It was $100.  Well, they got to get their money back anyhow for those movies. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, exactly.  So, okay.  So anyhow, back to my point was this Mac Damon movie, I wanted to get two movies.  Have you seen it?  Is it called The Green Zone or something?  All right, let's try to figure out.  Yes, I've seen The Green Zone.  Is that Mac Damon?  Most of it, anyway.  Is it one of those born supremacy?  No, he's not Jason Bourne in it.  No, he's just some guy.  It's the beginning of the Gulf War.  Or not the Gulf War, the last one, the second Bush War. 
[01:51:00]  Takes place in Iraq.  He's looking for WMDs.  Yeah.  And there seems to be this problem and little conspiracy thing going on and stuff.  How about Brooklyn's Finest?  Have you seen that?  I have not seen that yet.  What was your favorite movie of the last year, Rich?  Oh.  Tough one, huh?  I'll tell you, I don't remember.  I know a funny movie was that one with Gaddafellini and James Gaddafellini and James Gaddafellini.  Who?  Wait a minute.  James Gaddafellini, whatever the fuck his name is. 
[01:51:30]  Gandolfini?  The guy that was fucking on The Sopranos forever.  Wait, what's his name?  Gaddafellini or something.  Gaddafellini.  Whatever the fuck, you know who I'm talking about.  Tony Soprano.  But you can't go through life just saying that over and over again.  You know what I'm talking about.  Whatever.  It's early and I'm not always great with names.  Which movie was he in?  It was a comedy.  It was kind of funny where we attack Canada or take over Canada. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, Canadian Bacon?  Canadian Bacon?  No.  That's old school, right?  No.  That was fucking John Candy in that.  Yeah.  Yeah, they dug him up to do the remake.  The one where he, you know what, check it out.  Let's go to the computer.  Let's go to the computer.  Rich is directing.  All right.  Let's go to the computer. 
[01:52:30]  Let's go to the computer.  We're going to the computer now.  There is a gap in, I mean, obviously, we're not all that far in age, but there is a definite  technological gap that happened.  Between Rich and us?  Between like, yeah.  Yeah, I think so too.  Yeah, you really are not very technology savvy.  I'm fucking the worst and it's really starting to scare me because like, if you hang out  with Bobby, he's got fucking, it's like, he's like a walking, he's like walking Wall 
[01:53:00]  Street only with computers.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, he knows all the shit that's out.  Every, with his fucking eye touch pad, whatever, the fucking eye, that fucking, you know, big  blackboard computer he walks around with, that fucking, if he had two of them, he could  walk down a mountain like Moses, the big tablet.  But, and he has everything on it and he just knows what to do with everything.  He's like a fucking, he's like the, he's like Mr. Cut and Paste. 
[01:53:30]  So, but if you have an iPad, which is what they're called, you do know everything about  it.  No, you don't.  I have an iPhone and I just, what do I know?  I know, I know how to get, you know, what's in a while?  Do you have any apps?  Do you have any?  Yeah, fuck it.  He's got that bowling.  Like a bowling app.  Yeah, and even that now, if I don't throw the first three strikes, I get out of the  game and start over.  Oh, see, that's, that's not, that's cheating.  Because my highest game was 279.  But you don't have like, do you have Facebook on, on your iPhone? 
[01:54:00]  Yeah, but I, yeah, I'm not really into any of that.  Do you do any of your, your banking on your phone?  My banking?  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  They've made it safe, Rich.  Don't worry, Mr. Jew.  It's okay.  You're not going to lose your money.  No, it's not that.  You're going to fucking use the phone.  I don't, I don't bank on the phone.  Why wouldn't you?  Pay your bills?  There are times you're like, oh, fuck, I got to pay this bill.  And you just punch it up on your phone.  You're punching the amount.  Well, now.  And there you, there it goes.  Slide some shit around and you're good.  I'm kind of like, uh, what's that? 
[01:54:30]  It's on my bills.  That's your bill.  See, here's the thing with me.  Check your stocks.  With bills.  Oh, I'll tell you the dumb thing I did.  Well, first I want you to hear what's your bills.  Are you, are you still putting stamps on envelopes?  Oh, really?  Yes.  Uh, don't say, oh, really?  Of course.  A lot of people aren't.  How else would you send a fucking letter without a stamp?  No one writes letters, though.  No one writes letters.  They email or text.  Yeah, well, obviously.  You write letters?  Seriously, for the baby gift we sent him, he texted me.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Yeah, that's how you do it in the year 2010. 
[01:55:00]  Thank you.  You don't text a guy.  Thank you.  I'm not fucking sending you a thank you note, you fucking old school fucking asshole.  You are the most impersonal fucking asshole.  Oh, really?  Why are you making it about me?  It was a nice gift, and I wrote you back and said, thank you for the baby gift.  You know, first of all, you know what?  What do you want?  Send out a mass email.  Here's the thing.  What do you want?  You didn't write me back.  It wasn't a mass email.  You didn't write me back.  I said, tell Bonnie thanks for the gift.  And you never wrote back it.  I think that's when you found out that Bonnie sent me a gift, by the way.  You had no clue that she sent me a baby gift.  I told Bonnie to send you a gift.  Why do you think I got your address? 
[01:55:30]  But the reason he wrote back, I wrote him about, oh, we sat next to this guy on a plane,  and he goes, oh, cool, whatever.  Oh, and thanks for the gift.  Right.  And, like, that was an afterthought.  I got to sit down with stationery and write you a fucking thank you note?  No.  You know what?  You don't even have to.  But you could.  Obviously I have to.  You're taking it very personally.  You could say, you could send a text or an email and go, thank you for the gift.  But not, oh, by the way, and thank you for, like, that was, you know what I mean? 
[01:56:00]  That was, oh, fuck, he sent me a gift.  I don't know.  When we got gifts, we sent out thank you notes.  Maybe they don't do that anymore.  Maybe I'm just prehistoric.  You're so old school.  It's so weird.  First of all, yeah, we are sending out thank you notes to aunts and grandmas,  like people that would appreciate a thank you note.  Are you kidding me?  Not one of my peers.  I got to sit down and fucking get stationery out.  What's wrong with you?  Stationery and a quill.  Yes, we are.  My dearest Richard Voss.  Thank you, yeah.  We are. 
[01:56:30]  I wish to acknowledge and thank you oh so much for, like, a fucking Civil War love letter.  Yeah, we do send out thank you notes.  Okay.  That's for the older generation.  You just get a quill in your hand.  The rich has a quill and a little ink thing.  He dips it in.  I want a guy with a bald head and hair down his back in glasses.  Yes.  In knickers.  Oh.  No.  I said knickers.  Oh, okay.  I misunderstood.  You think he closes his envelopes with that wax shit and the seal?  And the seal.  I have one of those. 
[01:57:00]  I sent it off on the Pony Express.  What the fuck?  Are you serious?  A text isn't good enough?  I'll call your wife.  No, I guess a text is, I guess a, yeah, thank you notes for fucking ants and, and, and, and  shit like that.  Yeah.  Like, that's old school shit.  I really gotta fucking give you a fucking thank you note.  No, you could send me a Twitter.  Send me a picture.  You know what I, if you would have sent me a sunset picture, one of your, from your catalog.  A sunset, trust me. 
[01:57:30]  You know how I get over a hundred sunset pictures a day?  You, you, you take them?  And now I'm getting sunrises.  You mean people send them to you?  Every fucking day now.  I'm the, I'm the sunset kid.  And if you notice, I haven't tweeted as many sunsets.  I'm trying to get out of that world.  I really am.  I'm trying to put Cassidy in a sunset gift.  Right.  Okay.  Well, so now, now, now.  I love how the real shit comes out.  This guy is actually mad.  He's probably checking his mailbox every day.  I'm not mad at all.  Thank you note. 
[01:58:00]  Are you kidding me?  I'm not even mad.  I told Bonnie.  Well, why would you bring it up?  For good radio.  Why do I bring up short shorts?  Because I know how to, how to lead into stuff.  That's sometimes I'm a set up guy.  Oh, I like that.  You know?  Rich, I gotta ask you.  With, with your bills.  When you pay your bills, are you writing out a check?  You're writing out a check.  Yes.  You're, you're.  But not only do I write out a check, I have on my bulletin board next to my desk, I have  an index card. 
[01:58:30]  Okay.  Index cards.  With all my bills, like mortgage, condo, health insurance.  And then I have June, July, August.  And then I check it off when I pay the bill.  Because I have about 15 or 20 bills, so I don't want to fuck up.  And then, and then, if all my bills are paid for, for the month, by the second week, sometimes  I'm a month in advance.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  I fucking, I look at my checked index card, and I'm like, fucking, so, okay, so if you 
[01:59:00]  have it on your phone, you're going, did I pay that bill, or did I not pay that bill?  Are you out of your mind?  I could look back months on my phone and see what bill I paid, when I paid it, how much  the amount was, the check.  I could look at an image of the check itself, the back, the front, after they fucking endorsed  it.  I mean, I could, I could look at, I could pay a bill right now.  I could just sit there and go, oh, wow, I forgot to pay, like, you know, John Hancock  or something, and go there and put the amount in and hit it, and it'll, I could look at a 
[01:59:30]  list of every time I've paid that bill, when I paid it.  What do you mean?  You have it like, you have a, like a, a fucking.  There's a whole list of all my people that I pay every month.  Rich, how do you do that on your phone?  You make a list.  You set it up.  Yeah, you make your, how about this one?  You, you, you don't, you could just have the bank take the money out and pay your bills.  Well, I do that now for my mortgage.  Automatic, for things that are the same, for the things that are the same, yeah.  For my mortgage, I have them take it straight out of my account. 
[02:00:00]  You sound like a trainable.  You really do sound like somebody that they give money to and see if we can make it on the  bus.  Or make it living on their own, but they have, they have people constantly stopping over to  make sure it doesn't burn the house down.  Listen, I got so much shit on my mind.  You got to make sure he's not burning the house down.  I got so much shit on my mind.  Look, we all have one family member.  Let's be honest with each other here.  No, I got so much.  That one person you're like, you know, I think he can live on his own.  We're going to have to look after him a little bit, but.  I have so much shit on my plate that, you know, if I learn one thing. 
[02:00:30]  You're using index cards to fucking pay your bills.  No, that's to mark off.  How about you get a, like a, like a, you have a desk at home?  Yes.  So how about like an inbox, an outbox type of thing?  You put all the bills you got to pay in one box?  No, they come in.  They come in and, yeah, they come.  I do.  I have that on my little file.  And then you know, all right, everything in this tray I got to take care of.  Yeah, I do that.  And then you move it over to the other tray where you don't have to take care of it anymore  because it's done.  I do that.  I do.  Do you put the flag up in your mailbox still to alert the mailman that better get my mail 
[02:01:00]  today?  See, that's their, that's their technological gap.  It's so weird.  You are, you are really old school when it comes to, there's so many convenient things.  It just makes it like this iPhone is so fucking convenient for so many things.  I have.  Will you teach me?  But I have an account.  I have an account where I could buy and sell stocks.  I have to call a broker and hope I get through and get, it's sell, it's buy, sell immediately.  Yeah, but you know what the problem with that is? 
[02:01:30]  Here's the problem.  Here we go.  All you have to do without paying attention by mistake is hit one wrong number and everything  could go.  Yeah, well, don't do that.  That's when you look on the confirm trades page and then before you hit, you look and confirm  what you just did.  I still go over stuff I write and then I realize there's mistakes after it.  Like you can't make mistakes.  You can just draw a blank or that's what's, you got to be careful with those. 
[02:02:00]  My mistake was a couple of weeks ago I was sitting with my, I was talking to a person  that works on Wall Street and she said she's been getting memos from financial analysts  and advisors to take her money out of everything that is going to get super bad, right?  So this is called insider trading that you're talking about.  No, no.  That was just not to buy stocks, just to clear your money out.  That's not insider trading.  Yeah, it's insider trading.  It is?  If people are telling her before the fact that something's going to happen. 
[02:02:30]  No, they just, they're just speculating.  Oh, they were speculating.  They turn on TV and there's financial analysts that say, hey, it's going to get worse.  That's not insider trading.  I thought people knew stuff.  No, no, no.  This is just speculation.  All right, so they're speculating?  Good, okay.  So she told me, you know, that, so now I'm thinking we're going to turn into some Mad Max  shit out here.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Just like the whole economy is going to crumble and this and that.  And so I went and said, I went and said, so I, like a dummy, I bought, I just said one 
[02:03:00]  day, I don't know what got in my head, but I went and bought $20,000 worth of Canadian  money because I figure if our economy falls, at least maybe theirs will last another week  or two.  Are you kidding me?  I'm already losing.  How?  Yeah.  The Canadian dollar's down.  But the only thing we've ever really had at its best was parity with their money.  No, they've gone above us twice.  They've gone above us, but not to the amount where you're going to make a fucking fortune.  No, no.  Not worth the risk or time. 
[02:03:30]  Well, here's the thing.  Oh, Rich.  Well, here's Canadian money.  I know.  And then I...  I bought some drachma and some Deutschmarks.  A couple of Cougarands.  I bought a ruble.  Is that what it's called?  Well, Cougarands...  Are from Russia?  No.  It's Krugerand, and they were from South Africa.  Oh.  And they're gold coins.  Oh, that was...  And they don't make them anymore.  And they're very valuable. 
[02:04:00]  Because...  Obviously, because they're gold, but also because they're just not made anymore.  There's your thank you note.  A Cougarand...  there's your thank you note  yeah really  yes that's your thank you note  can you start it from the bottom  Obie just wrote  Voss a thank you note  on the back of his promo sheet  with sharpie  it's a thank you note  see this is what 
[02:04:30]  you need  now I'm going he appreciates  now if we cut  that piece of paper in half then the other part  could go on the bottom  I ran out of room so then I had to make the arrow  and go to the top of the page  that's your thank you note  can you pass it along to Bonnie who actually did all the fucking work  for my son's baby gift  oh really I'm the one who got your address and told her to send it  and who pays indirectly  let me say hi to  Jimmy in Jersey  Jimmy  hey I got your father time 
[02:05:00]  putting aside the fact that you had your wife do it  did she go out and actually pick out the gift  and go to the post office and mail it  or did she do it with everybody else  go on and click a few buttons  and it went by overnight man  yeah did he do it online  megaphone mouth  did she do it online  yeah she does that  she sends all her gifts online  that's lazy  so then my lazy thank you note  should be perfectly acceptable  yeah she did it online  because  why not  why is it 
[02:05:30]  text message is good  alright so  you have someone in your corner  this guy is  he makes a valid point  he really is like old school  and takes it very seriously  I'm sorry  maybe I'm like my grandparents  they grew up  they were racist  and I couldn't  and you know what  they were racist  yeah  we lived in a black neighborhood  but they hated  all the neighbors  they were quite racist  and you couldn't change it  they didn't hate enough to move  oh because 
[02:06:00]  my grandfather had a construction business  but why would they change it  see this is  something different  you can change this  there was nothing worse  there's reason to change this  I was a little kid  and I used to play down the block  with all the black kids  and I'd be on the block  and know all the kids  and stuff  because in the front of my house  like were the white kids  and in the back  were the black kids  like we lived on the corner  so I always felt in between  like I wasn't good enough  to hang with the white kids  but I was a little bit  so I would sit  and hang with the black kids  and we'd play it  and then my grandmother 
[02:06:30]  once the street lights came on  came walking down  the fucking street  in her nightie  with her fucking stockings  to her ankle  and a cigarette  with the ash  about four foot long  going Richard  Robert  time to come home  and black kids  don't want to see that  and they just  fucking tormented me  it was horrible  then you were just  the laughing stock  here comes Richard's grandmother  and shit  and fucking just  the worst  I had to deal with my parents  and grandparents  because we lived above my grandparents 
[02:07:00]  you know  because we had no money  so our grandparents  we'd live above them  you know  for free  because they had a multifamily house  yeah  and like you know  and then  we'd have to go down  to their fucking house  for dinner on Friday night  and I'd have to watch them  eat fucking  chicken soup  and pour ketchup in it  to turn it into  tomato chicken soup  and the fucking  just horribleness  and then  just fucking  horrible  wasn't good  no  it doesn't sound  very  it wasn't a funny  grandparents die  in the house

[02:16:00]  with binoculars  yeah up in these  fucking  not you  him  I lived in the  back of this house  too  I rented an apartment  with my girlfriend  at the time  this is the first girl  I ever fell in love  with I think  and I caught her  fucking my best friend  I was in this apartment  right here  right there  I threw all her clothes  which window  the back left  because you're pointing  at another computer  so we don't know  what you're pointing at  the back left  of this building  oh okay  I threw all the clothes  out the window  you know  right  and  and  it was like 
[02:16:30]  heartbreaking  at the time  yeah of course  and then I moved  I said fucking  I moved to Colorado  and I  he lives in an upper  middle class neighborhood  and he's trying to  make believe it was  the project  can we drive there  right now  I'm telling you  it looks good  drive there right now  it's  that's where  this is it  no this house  is not the bad area  that one block  when I grew up  was all heroin  and drugs  alright where are we  going now  back here  between here  that's a  let's drive  let's virtually drive  to the shitting area  that's a halfway house  see  that's a halfway house 
[02:17:00]  it looks nice  just cause you see  trees doesn't make  it a good area  oh there's a problem  well let's see  what this is  that could be a problem  yeah  yeah  well look  he's sweeping  the fucking walkway  though  yeah blood  guy's sweeping up  that's a halfway house  no it's  it looks good  cause there's trees  what else you want  to show us  in the neighborhood  anything else  show us the house  where you have to  wear the short shorts  for the drug dealer  oh that was  I don't know  where that was  that was in  West Orange  or East Orange  where we used to go there 
[02:17:30]  this is amazing  I have to learn  how to do this  fuck paying bills  online  I want to take  I want to  virtual tours  all over the place  and it's  you could see  why  is this today  is this happening  right now  is this real life  and he is going  to the dentist  can we fucking  film you after  your fucking dentist  I got stitches  no I'm saying 
[02:18:00]  is that going on  right now  Rich no  it takes quite a while  why would you tell him  no  just  if it was  how would that work  yeah  like there would have  to be cameras on  like every  in the middle of the road  every three feet  yeah work it out  in your head  all across the world  work it out in your head  no  first of all  there's no  work it out in your head  how would that be  because if you  right now  work it out  work it out  what I'm saying  is like you could 
[02:18:30]  go to traffic  and see cars  and how traffic  is today  on traffic cameras  yeah  yeah  on whatever  it's different  no it's not traffic  cameras  there's not traffic  cameras everywhere  if you plug in  if you go to your  map quest  I mean to your  fucking whatever  your map thing  there's a thing  on it where  it shows you  the traffic  how it's moving  alright so how  are you  like a little  red line on a road  that'll say  no cars  cars  are you seeing  actual traffic  yes  well that's  why would you  wait wait wait  how are they  getting that  that that 
[02:19:00]  footage  the satellite  oh jesus  the satellite again  I don't fucking  know how they  get it  well you said  no to traffic  cameras and that's  the answer  they have traffic  cameras  everywhere  no  they don't have  them everywhere  okay  on every highway  well all I know  is  think  oh you mean  when I  fucking  think it out  what I'm  saying is  yeah  go ahead  this is gonna  fuck up private  investigators  they're not gonna 
[02:19:30]  have to sit  outside anymore  they could just  go online and  go look who's  walking into  your house  see what I'm  saying  you know  what I'm  saying  no  what  the traffic  cameras  you think  are coming  from satellites  I don't  they have  traffic cameras  on specific  roads that  they know  are busy  that people  care about  yeah they're  they're cameras  not on every  fucking road  what are the  odds the one  road I picked  had a traffic  camera  what are the 
[02:20:00]  odds  it's stunning  it's stunning  me  he doesn't  even know  if we're  fucking with  them  it's amazing  traffic cameras  what road  it was a  road  just a  regular road  what road  did you see  a traffic  camera on  I didn't  see I saw  traffic online  okay but  where was the  traffic  in Hillsboro  one day  I think it  was Amwell  road  so they have  a traffic  camera  I could go  to a site  that lists  every traffic 
[02:20:30]  camera in  New York  and you  could pretty  much look  at every  single road  in New York  it's amazing  but they're  cameras that  are up on  poles  not satellites  satellites are  very busy  they're very  busy  they can't  just  individually  look at  shit  in real  time  for you  for the  military  see those  are all  cameras  and then  you could  click one  and there  you go  that's what  I'm talking  about  that's what  I'm saying  that's a camera 
[02:21:00]  on a pole  on Northern  Boulevard  see what I'm  saying is  right now  if you got  on that  road  you would  just zoom  and zip  through  there's no  traffic  that is live  as we speak  okay so now  where are we  going  no we're not  going anywhere  I'm just going  to find out  that site  well how old  do you think  that picture was  of my old  neighborhood  it could be  years old  anywhere from  a year to  a couple of  weeks depends  on when they  drive that car  through  what about  the street view  we did with  your old house  that car was  real old  street view 
[02:21:30]  and we're also  talking about  like satellite  mapping  street view  they're probably  starting to update  already  is that the  website you went  to was called  street view  no it's google  no but to find  maps.google.com  can we go back  to his neighborhood  anything else  to show us  in the neighborhood  I want to look  at your old  house because  we kind of  went by that  too fast  rich's old  house you  can tell us  some stories  about the  fire escape  I gotta put  it back in  I told you 
[02:22:00]  about the  dead guy  upstairs  did he start  smelling  he didn't show  up for work  for a couple  days so they  came there  the family  and they  opened the  door  the good  thing is  the coroner  he was already  in a bag  so they just  had to scoop  him up  you made fun  of me when I  said that  was the bag  around just  his fucking  head  yeah they  put it around  your head  it cuts down  your breathing  yeah alright  and  I thought it  was a body  bag  I was getting  confused  just how you  were telling  the story  remember where  it is  okay  alright here's 
[02:22:30]  rich's old  house again  yeah it's not  a bad house  see this tree  how big this  tree is  I remember  when it was  planted  wow you're old  that fucking  tree when it  was planted  Jesus it's about  it's a redwood  tree  yes at least  70 feet  there's a tunnel  there's a tunnel  remember those  the tunnel  how amazed you  were as a kid  alright look  rich we're right  outside your old  house  here's the front  door if you go  and tell us  something about the  other houses  okay go across the  street here  okay go here  go here 
[02:23:00]  stop  right there  behind that house  is where we used  to play basketball  he was a great  guy  with the black  guys  yeah there was  white kids that  came from that  now we're starting  to see  alright you know  that guy is a  blood right there  it's gonna be tough  to continue because  we just found a  blood  there's a blood  walking down the  street  there's no denying  that this is now  a rough neighborhood  it's pure daylight  he's got the hood  tight  oh yeah  he's wearing the  red hoodie  and the bandana 
[02:23:30]  he looks so  suspicious in the  picture  even I have to  say that  this house  we used to  in the back here  he put a  basketball court  with a blacktop  and we'd go  play  do I remember  having a fight  with this kid  Russell  right  and we had  a fight  and I punched  him in the eye  and then he  grabbed me  and we both  fell right  to the ground  and all the  weight fell  on my elbow  here  if I could  show  and I dislocated  my elbow  I could only  bend it this far  see the difference  in the bend  so why are you  blaming me 
[02:24:00]  on that stupid  elbow injury  from a few  years ago  no that was  this elbow  the right elbow  you guys got  alright  so now you're  matching elbows  you should be  thanking me  so see  I can only  and I can see  how I can turn  my wrist like this  I can't turn  it all away  and that's why  you have a bad  golf swing  oh I don't have  a bad golf swing  you have a horrible  golf swing  really  when I played  with you  I was three  over a par  on the back  the last time  we played  oh really  I broke 40  I like to play  inside the leather  myself  not two club  lengths  I never take  putts 
[02:24:30]  oh  this is  so we used  to play back  alright  so that's the  basketball court  and I got  in a fight  back there  so I punched  him in the eye  but he fell  on my arm  and broke  my arm  you broke  your elbow  I dislocated it  it popped out  oh it's the  fucking worst  and then  he told everybody  in school  that he  I'm confused  by this neighborhood  because it really  does look like  it's a nice  neighborhood  but then  the guy  in the red  hoodie  that wasn't  the giveaway  so  it's not  this neighborhood 
[02:25:00]  is okay  was okay  this is the  front  but the side  street  I'm telling you  should we get  to this side  street  or we haven't  been able to  you went up  this little hoe  lived on that  house  this little hoe  she used to  fuck everybody  except me  she fucked  everybody  because you like  guys  huh  nothing  yeah black  guys  yeah  alright  where are we  going now  on the side  street  yeah there's  Richmond  that's the  fucking  I'm telling you  there used to be  guns going off  at night  police  fucking chases  the ice cream

[02:40:30]  you're amazing  oh thank you  where  Webster  Comedy Club  where the fuck  was that  Harlem  where was  Webster  oh  it's in  New York  Rochester  New York  oh I'll be  back there  in September  yeah I saw  you you're  great  oh thanks  all right  sound like a  real black  guy but  where we  going with this  Rich  well because  where we were  going was  before he was  talking about  everybody knows  about stuff  I was saying  everybody knows  about concentration  camps and the  Nazis  yeah but  maybe not  you know 
[02:41:00]  the founder  of the  Black  Panthers  or the  poet  laureate  there's a  problem  coming in  though  the phone  just  fucking  went nuts  Lisa on  Long Island  yes Lisa  Rich it's  Stoke Lee  Carmichael  big deal  so I left  the L out  okay  who's  Hoagie  Carmichael  okay so  that's all  Stoke Lee  it's been  since the  60s  you said  it with  such  confidence  well  Huey  Newton  was  right  Angela  Davis  out of 
[02:41:30]  all of  the point  is  who is  Fig  Newton  okay  Figgy  Newton  alright  see you're  fucking fans  the problem  was that  they're such  nitpickers  they are  I agree  with you  they really  are  but you  make it  easy for  them  you know  these  fucking  guys  you're  basically  coming across  saying I'm  an expert  on black  history  I didn't  say I was  an expert  I was  making a  point to  Anthony  when he  said people  know 
[02:42:00]  history  I'm going  people under  25 don't  know history  but I was  just talking  about the  concentration  camps and  the Nazis  well I was  given an  point  I was  given  an example  that  you know  and then  we went to  black  I don't know  why  there are  certain  historical  figures  that people  will know  people know  Hitler  it doesn't  matter how  old  you know  a 15  year old  knows who  Hitler is  I bet you 
[02:42:30]  there's people  that don't  know who  Hitler is  that's why  I try to  educate  that's a rough  one Rich  I think  even a lot  of young  young people  embracing the  Hitler  they're embracing  it a little bit  you know something  as time goes  by  there's a whole  thing going on  I'm not saying  every young  when we talk  about the  Titanic  being a horrible  tragedy  nowadays they  have that  ride  they blow up  the big  fucking balloon 
[02:43:00]  thing  kids slide  down the  deck  of the  Titanic  it's like  people really  died and it  was a tragedy  but now it's  a fucking  carnival ride  so Hitler  in time  a little time  kind of gets  in the way  people start  thinking like  ah  you know  some of his  ideology  obviously  not good  but  you look at  things like  the Audubon  that was  you know  based  we based  the Eisenhower  highway system  on Hitler's  vision of  highways 
[02:43:30]  and interstates  well yeah  pretty soon  you'll go  there'll be  like cutouts  you can take  a picture  with Hitler  exactly  things like  that  we went  to the  carnival  the other  night  took our  kid there  a log  flume  you went  to a  carnival  yeah  we took  the kid  to the  local  carnival  and the  people that  worked there  it's  I mean  it's obviously  carnival  hacking material  but you know  the long slide  that you go down  on the knapsack  you know  you slide  oh yes  you get that  burlap bag  that is real  trash by the way 
[02:44:00]  and make sure  you keep all  your fucking  skin on the  fucking burlap  so my kid  was too small  to go on  and I go  to the carnival  geek  can my wife  go on  with the kid  and he  I go  can my wife  go on  with the kid  do you want  to go to  prison  what  that's a  federal  offense  what's a  federal  offense  to have  your wife  go on  the kid  go on  your wife's  lap  going down  the slide  so he gave  me this  history  the biography  of the  fucking  slide  the biography 
[02:44:30]  of the  slide  huh  yeah  these carnival  geeks  boy they know  their rides  they know  their pedophilia  too  I know  fucking  creeps  explain  what do  they tell  you about  it  he was  telling me  all this  I go  was he  yes or  no  I really  don't  fucking  I really  don't  care  well some  lady took  her kid  on the  ride  and flipped  out  and the  kid flew  over to  the side  he's still  in a coma  really  is that  when you  were in  your hour  of carnival  class  that's what  they told  you  shut your  stupid  mouth  that Hitler  got involved  in a lot 
[02:45:00]  of the  construction  projects  didn't he  look at  him with  the shovel  what is that  the first  shovel full  of the  Autobahn  that was  Adolf Hitler's  highway  yes it was  Adolf Hitler's  highway  and there  he is  you know  breaking  ground  one of the  generals behind  him just  smiling  look at that  there was no  highways before  the Autobahn  you're saying  that was the  first fucking  highway  I'm saying  there were no  major highways  with things like  the on-ramp  and clover  leaves  and very 
[02:45:30]  long range  it was constructed  very well  engineered  there were roads  but it was like  cross streets  and roads  like you get  in towns  this was the  idea of having  a highway  where you go  at high speed  get off of  the highway  and then you  hit the roads  in the various  towns that you  go to  and there wasn't  shit like that  not to the  extent of the  Autobahn  and it was  another one of  these programs  that Hitler  and his people  came up with  to employ  the German 
[02:46:00]  people who  were feeling  a bit down  about themselves  after the  Treaty of Versailles  so you know  kind of got  the people  all revved  up with  things like  construction  and a strong  military  and oh yeah  killing Jews  and killing Jews  and stealing  their wealth  I'm just saying  there were  some things  and then there  were other  things  rich  I always love  the pictures  and videos  of happy  Hitler  happy Hitler  is hysterical  because just  Hitler you always  picture him 
[02:46:30]  yelling or screaming  or he's just  got like no  emotion  just looking  very stern  when you see  Hitler with a  smile on his  face it almost  looks unnatural  like it's  photoshopped  or something  why is he  smiling  look how happy  he is shoveling  that dirt  and everybody  around him  generals and  other people  and construction  people around  them are all  like whoa  even the  construction  the construction  people they had  were part of  like this  military  organization  they weren't  just like  workers  there was 
[02:47:00]  this pride  that they  felt like  you know  they were  part of  something  look at  smiling  Hitler  with a  baby  the baby's  like tugging  on his  little mustache  and he's  looking in his  mouth to see  if the baby  has gold teeth  wow  right  Steve from  Bayshore  it's the  R.A.D.  yes  they were the  construction  like the  construction  battalion  kind of a  thing  they had 
[02:47:30]  little patches  with shovels  on them  it was very  very nice  I think  something tells  me later  they had to  change their  occupation  to something  else  like throwing  shovels at  Russian tanks  take that  shovel  and charge  after that  T-fucking  36  see that's  more like  the Hitler  we know  the swept  hair  the very  stern look  on his  face  you know  all it had 
[02:48:00]  to take  was one  fucking  administrator  to say  yes  you can  get into  art class  I know  right  one fucking  that's a  good painting  that's a  good painting  oh really  history  one person  one lousy  person  that didn't  like  you know  maybe that  person had  a bad  day  he'd have  written a  book  mind  paintings  it always  comes down  to that  one person 
[02:48:30]  Jesus  yep  one person  fucked him  over  you'll never  make it in  this fucking  business  you and your  painting  why don't you  go to  oh yeah  what are you  gonna do  conquer the  world  oh fuck  yeah that guy  sitting there  going geez  I should have  kept my mouth  shut  what an  asshole  it's that  one  it's like  that one  it's smiling  Hitler  he's just  sitting there  in his  regular duds  he's got that  Hitler hat on  not military  just a regular  suit  but let's go to  Joe in Jersey  Joe  hello Joe

[02:50:30]  Bayshore  is calling  you  Adolf  Spittler  see that's  funny  Steve  from  Bayshore  will always  come up  with a  good  Nazi  joke  cut this  guy loose  is that  the guy  who looks  like Elvis  the bloated  Elvis  the bloated  Elvis  who's the  guy that  comes to  your house  he does  have  sideburns  and he  sings a  wonderful  Elvis  he does  Elvis  very very  well  if a  couple  hornets  stung  him  Jesus  come on  is he  your fucking 
[02:51:00]  Nazi leader  are you scared  of him  no I'm not  scared of him  but he's  very informative  about  he's very  informed about  the era  the era  and you know  World War II  the equipment  the people  you know  the makers  and shakers  the players  on the planet  the king of evil  is just  Elvis of evil  people  Auschwitz  oh yeah 
[02:51:30]  snappy  dresser's  gonna set  my right  gonna set  my right  on fire  there's  a whole  lot of  gold teeth  I'm ready  to pull  so stack  them corpses  higher  there's  a thousand  choking  women  stuffed  tied in  there  they're  barely breathing  psyched on bees  in the air  I'm just a  furor  with bullets 
[02:52:00]  to spare  so  Viva  Daz  Herschwitz  Viva  Daz  Herschwitz  we were enjoying  the song  but Rich  threw his  headphones  down  Rich does not  like it  he's got food  all over his  microphone  what's your  problem  it's another  empty person  that has nothing  to follow  or nothing  to offer  in life  oh my god  the guy  the guy did  first of all  he did a  perfect rendition  of Elvis Presley 
[02:52:30]  it's supposed  to be an  offensive song  it's part of  one of the  most offensive  songs ever  maybe he could  have parachute  with the other  Elvis's  who gives a  fuck  he did a  parody of  a song  really  is that  getting him  fucking famous  these people  that are  fucking  Nazi  followers  that never  happens  that you  write a  song  parody  and actually  get a  career out  of it  I have  nothing  against  bands  that do  cover music  like U2 
[02:53:00]  and stuff  like that  that's cool  some guy  you just don't  get it  I want to  be a part  of something  but I really  have nothing  to offer  in life  so maybe  I could  join some  white supremacist  or maybe  I could  become a  fucking  whatever  or just  a whole  fucking  Nazi  you're taking  this very  personally  because of  your Jewish  heritage  either way  you get  these white  kids  that all  of a sudden  are fucking  in the  Taliban  or I  want to 
[02:53:30]  be part  of something  so I'm  going to  fucking  become  some  you know  what I  mean  I don't  think Steve  from Bayshore  is a white  supremacist  or trying  to become  part of  the Nazi  movement  I'm not  saying him  directly  so why  didn't you  enjoy the  song  I thought  it was  very well  done  very well  written  it's very  offensive  I'll give  you that  but it's  supposed to  be  that's the  whole gimmick  of the song  is how  offensive it  is  would you  expect  Patrice  to sit  here  and listen 
[02:54:00]  to a  song  about  slavery  and being  on the  bottom  of a boat  we have  we have  we played  the house  next door  to me  you're sold  which one  was that  Iraq just  talked in my ear  Patrice sat  through that  steel wool  commercial  from Australia  exactly  you want to  see what  Patrice sat  through recently  a couple  days ago  a mere  couple  days ago  when was the last  time you went to  Temple  let's not get  technical  when was the last  time you went to  Temple Mr. Jew  you're all of a sudden  now super Jew  I don't have to be 
[02:54:30]  super  you don't have to go  to fucking  Temple and sit  there and  you know there's a  guy you can still  believe in stuff  and not go to  Temple or church  you can believe in a  God and not have to  go to church  okay  so if this was about  Catholicism would you  fucking just be like  oh this is good or  I don't mind this at  all  it's just like I had  an argument with  Norton and he said  something about  Mel Gibson  I still love his  work this and that  I go because you're  not connected to it  in any way  you have no  connection  how are you  connected to it 
[02:55:00]  how are you  connected to Mel  Gibson  well when someone  makes anti-Semitic  remarks or  oh I forgot  about the Jews  how do you  lighten up  no no no  because it just  feeds into it  don't worry about it  don't worry so much  because you're not  connected to it  you're not connected  if people start  attacking dry hair  then you would say  you would go  you know what  I could see the  fucking part  like if everywhere you  people were pointing  oh there's another  dry hair  you know  let's fucking  it's very greasy  as a matter of fact  I have like  prisoner hair 
[02:55:30]  I went to brush it  back this morning  I have convict hair  today  whatever you call it  what I'm just saying  okay there's a greasy  hair  Italians  but there's no really  hatred towards Italians  we're all an organized  crime  it's fucking  yeah go pour your  cement you guinea  oh come on  I'm gonna get all  upset about that  no because that's  not negative  organized crime  isn't really negative  oh it's not negative  no it's glorified  it's glorified  in the public  it's glorified 
[02:56:00]  people  Sopranos was glorified  if you see a show  like Sopranos  it's glorified  but if you see a show  called Penny Pigeon Jew  it's not glorified  okay  alright  can I get that  what's the problem  with no Gibson  and the fight with Norton  well what I'm saying  is hold on  oh god  holy Jesus  I thought James  oh shit  I thought James  Gamelflani did a great  job too  oh  didn't he almost say 
[02:56:30]  Sopranos  that's what I'm saying  Apollo Fire is saying  that Penny Pigeon Jew  was on TV  it was just called  Seinfeld  oh  if you're not  connected  before you had a child  you weren't connected  but if you  you're not going to go  I know what you're going to say  I was always sensitive  to some of the child shit  always  okay  you know what I'm saying  but I didn't speak up  I didn't speak up  about it  I'm like if these guys  want to do their  you know  do the child stuff  then who am I 
[02:57:00]  yeah but now you're  more sensitive towards it  because you have a child  I'm sensitive but I'm not  going to like influence  the show  he's not going to rip  his headphones off  when we start making  miscarriage jokes  right  it's not my  because there was no  miscarriage  he had a baby  no but it's not my  I'm big time connected  to kids dying  because my dad  lost two fucking kids  to crib down  so when these guys  do make those jokes  I step back  because it's not my thing  but I don't sit here  and fucking stop  the show over it  if say  okay say  an actor 
[02:57:30]  right  was  a great actor  you liked his work  and I'm not saying  just in general  or a great musician  was caught raping kids  right say  or whatever  that's pretty  like Roman Polanski  we watch Roman Polanski  movies and love them  you ever see  The Pianist  huh  you ever see  The Pianist  please  I watch it naked  is that the one  with fucking  Rush  Jeffrey Rush  or Joffrey Rush  or whatever 
[02:58:00]  that's  Harvey Keitel  that's the one  with Harvey Keitel  there's a couple  piano movies  there's a lot of them  there's so many  fucking piano movies  The Pianist  is about a piano player  in Poland  that had to hide  from the Nazi  it's a fantastic  fucking movie  but could Danny  look up all the  piano movies  for Rush  yeah there's tons  of them  would a Mozart  movie be in there  maybe  yeah  did you see  Valkyrie  yeah  no you didn't  yes I did  with Brad Pitt 
[02:58:30]  yeah that one  scene was intense  where the guy  won the Oscar  Brad Pitt  and Valkyrie  oh no not Valkyrie  that stunk  I'm talking about  the one where  no no no  that was Tom  Tom Cruise  Tom Cruise  where he was doing  I didn't even have  a German accent  he was a Nazi  soldier  speaking English  which movie  that won the Oscar  that you're talking  about  the one with  you know  where the Jews  were beating  people  the fucking  what's his name  you know  that did  Dust of Dawn  Quentin Tarantino  movie  what's that  you know  the fucking 
[02:59:00]  you know  the fucking  it was fucking  a big movie  last year  keep going  whatever  well what I'm  saying is  if you're  connected to  something  if you're  connected  alright so  you got a  director that  had sex  with kids  now where  are we going  oh whatever  you're not  going to support  that  even if that  person  you're going  to feel  ducks till dawn  did he say  ducks till dawn  no I said  dusk  ducks till dawn  quack quack  quack  the sun's  coming up  quack  he didn't  say burlap 
[02:59:30]  he said  knapsack  ugh  yeah but he did  say that U2  was a cover band  and a lot of  U2 fans  are upset  by that  I'm sure  they have  covered  well they  have covered  a few songs  in their career  I didn't say U2  was a cover band  I said U2  cover bands  you know  you can get  good cover bands  that's different  but you don't  get it  you're talking  about  inglorious  bastards  by the way  that was  the movie  so you don't  like  I wouldn't have  thought of that  what about  downfall  did you see  downfall  with kirk  douglas  no  forget it  that was  what was that 
[03:00:00]  one with  I mean  michael douglas  where he fucking  snapped  it was great  falling down  I'm talking  about downfall  where it was  about Hitler's  last few days  in the bunker  and what went  on during the  fall of the  third reich  can I ask  Rich about  something though  the Mel Gibson  thing  so you don't  like Mel Gibson  because he  made the Jew  comments  but you don't  care about  Mel Gibson  that might  have beat  the shit  out of his  girlfriend  here's the  thing with  that  but that's  what I'm  saying  I didn't 
[03:00:30]  even hear  that tape  yet  if he never  said the  Jew thing  would you  still watch  Mel Gibson  movies  after listening  to the Mel Gibson  I didn't hear  the tape  but would I  yeah  because I'm  not really  connected  with that  that's what  I'm saying  if you're  connected  yeah  because I'm  not connected  with that  alright  it affects  you a little  bit  this is what  we played  for Patrice  by the way  this is as  bad as it  gets  Patrice  was sitting  in your seat  two three  days ago  and this 
[03:01:00]  came in  nigga boy  nigga boy  nigga boy  nigga boy  nigga boy  nigga boy  nigga boy  nigga boy  nigga boy  nigga boy  nigga boy  nigga boy  nigga boy  nigga boy  nigga boy  it's commercial  for uh  for like uh  steel wool  best a lady ever had.  In Australia.  From the old days.  A nigga boy shine  is the shiniest shine.  Thanks to anilin  soap in every pack.  What's the brand  that everyone demands?  Nigga boy, nigga boy, nigga boy. 
[03:01:30]  And what's the gentlest  cleaner on your hand?  What is it?  Why, nigga boy?  Of course it is.  Nigga boy, nigga boy, nigga boy,  nigga boy, nigga boy, nigga boy.  So that answers your question.  Is that a prop?  No.  Patrice is sitting there  and we played that.  Hold on, you're wrong.  You're wrong because that doesn't it.  That's a parody.  Well, it's not even a parody.  It was a real thing.  But it's not talking about slavery.  It's a joke on...  Dude, when it comes to black stuff,  the N-word is the worst  fucking thing you could say.  What are you talking about?  No, I think...  Bringing up slavery 
[03:02:00]  or openly saying the N-word?  Really?  No, but if you write a song about...  What will get you punched faster?  If you write a song...  No, if you write a song about,  you know,  pick me another sweater,  whatever,  I think it's more offensive  than just saying that word.  Because it brings feelings  and, you know, just...  You're just a buzzkill man.  Sorry.  You're just a real downer man.  I'm sorry.  Oh, really?  After the Hitler videos and... 
[03:02:30]  Well, we showed you happy Hitler.  And stupid...  What?  This all...  He answers to stupid.  What?  We were talking...  What?  We were talking to each other.  But listen to me.  What?  Do you realize  this whole Hitler-Nazi thing  leading to the Stephen from...  This is how our show works,  by the way.  Yeah.  Leading to the Stephen from Bayshore  Elvis thing  all started because of you?  Right.  You showed us the video  of I Will Survive 
[03:03:00]  in front of the fucking  concentration camp.  And that wasn't sad  and uncomfortable?  I admitted that.  I might have finally  saw something  that I'm offended by.  But that's where  it all started.  You brought it up.  Yeah.  But I wasn't saying...  That wasn't...  It was...  Oh, man.  It's just going...  There's too many things  going on in my head  right now  for this early in the morning.  It's just too fucking...  Too many things going on.  How many?  One?  One too many?  You are a funny motherfucker. 
[03:03:30]  You get a lot of shit wrong,  but man,  no one can take  your fucking humor  away from you.  There's rules.  Rich Voss made the  poof, poof, poof sounds.  Fuck, Rich.  Oh, God damn it.  Just coughed up  a fucking lung.  What color was it?  What color was it?  We got a couple  bad memories.  That spewed him.  What color was that? 
[03:04:00]  Huh?  Yeah, you should have  checked the color.  Kind of oyster looking.  No, I'm serious  because we were studying  the color of your phlegm earlier.  That was regular phlegm.  Regular white phlegm?  Phlegma?  Yeah.  All right,  can we go back  to having fun or...  Yeah, I'm having a good time.  You're just bawling us  all out, man.  Huh?  What's the matter?  You're bringing in  your personal feelings  into a comedy show.  Right.  We all have our crosses  to bear.  You always have  your personal feelings.  No, man, I don't...  We don't bring the show down 
[03:04:30]  with our personal feelings.  That's right.  What do you do,  bring it down by turning  on the mics?  What the fuck?  You bring in your  personal feelings all the time.  What are you fucking kidding me?  No.  If you talk about  your ex-wife one more time,  that's personal feelings.  But I don't bring the show  down by it.  No, he makes jokes about it.  I try to make jest of it.  You know, I try to...  Oh, yeah.  Get a couple...  Fuck her and fuck her lawyer.  I never said that.  Really?  You make used to fuck her?  I never said fuck her  and fuck her lawyer.  I wouldn't say that.  Why?  You can get in trouble? 
[03:05:00]  I don't want to test  those waters.  I don't want to test  those waters, my friend.  He talks around stuff.  And the jokes are there.  I just talk about  what it was like.  I'm able to convey  my life experiences  to the audience.  So I like doing that  about, you know,  when I was married  and, you know,  Oprah would drive me home  and we'd go around  the block five times  because I didn't want  to go home.  Shit like that.  Really?  That's a personal...  Yeah, yeah.  Because it was date night  and she would light candles  and they'd be all in the house  and I'd drive by  and just look at Oprah  and go,  just keep going. 
[03:05:30]  Keep going.  Do another loop.  Who is that to Carrie's mother?  I know, right?  Do another loop.  I can see your dirty pillars.  She would light candles  on date night?  Yep.  They're breasts, mama.  Breasts.  Oh, jeez.  Stab her.  Do you still talk to her at all?  No!  Really?  Why would I?  You talk to her...  Well, he talks to his ex.  She's our baby.  We're good friends.  Yeah, well, you know something...  Because I had kids.  You didn't have kids with her.  More power to...  No.  So you don't have to.  No. 
[03:06:00]  You're one in a million  where you get along  with your ex  because you had kids with her.  Yeah, but, you know,  when you don't get along...  Well, maybe not one in a million,  but most people  would not get along  with the ex.  Fighting costs money.  You fight in the beginning,  but then you learn to grow...  And then it gets to the point  where she's now babysitting  your new kid  with your new wife.  That's fucking weird, dude.  I came along...  No way.  I could see maybe  being cordial  and not having a problem  with an ex,  but to get to the point  where she's babysitting  your kid with your new wife  is weird.  Well, once in a while,  I got off the road  a couple weeks ago 
[03:06:30]  and Bonnie was over at her house  hanging out  with the baby at the pool  because her kid  plays with my kid.  You know, her older kid.  Look, if it works for you,  great.  That's just bizarre.  It's not bizarre.  I mean, there's so many people...  Do you ever look at your ex  and have a feeling like...  No.  No, I don't know.  Never?  No, it's not like that.  Why, she let herself go?  No, she looks good.  She had four kids.  She looks very good. 
[03:07:00]  You know, she's attractive.  Old times sake, thank you.  What's that?  Maybe for old times sake.  Old times sake.  No.  It's just...  I don't even think about that.  I'm not really...  That's weird.  I don't think about sex that much.  But it's weird you got to that point  where you're all just friends.  Yeah.  I don't think we'll get  many of those stories.  Well, I mean, you know,  you've had ex-girlfriends in life  that you were friends with.  I don't...  There's only...  I admitted this to my girl  like actually at dinner yesterday.  Only one ex-girlfriend  I would like to see 
[03:07:30]  what she's up to.  You probably.  And that was the one  we were trying to look up  Anthony the other day.  And then it came really close.  I would love to just call her  and go,  hey, you know,  how is your fucking life?  You probably have ex-girlfriends  that are in college now.  You probably.  No, but you're talking about a marriage.  There's only one ex  I even talk to.  Yeah.  But you get along with her, right?  Yeah, but that is an anomaly.  I mean, believe me.  Oh, that's something odd.  Yeah.  It's not of the usual. 
[03:08:00]  I wouldn't...  See, that's...  No other ex  have I ever spoken to.  See, Rich, that's really funny.  I've never spoken to another ex.  You thought someone  was going to steal your bag?  No, I thought I fell on the floor.  No.  Can I steal your bag?  No.  What the fuck?  I did not.  We're already doing parodies.  We don't need to do props today.  Okay?  Jesus.  I got the right color hair.  I could do a little carrot top  for everybody.  I want to see what's in your bag.  Some props.  What do you carry around in your bag? 
[03:08:30]  That stuff has some...  Just shit,  because I stayed overnight  in a hotel last night  to do the show this morning.  You know.  But they're giving me XM,  so I'm pretty happy about that.  Where were we, Rich?  I get along with my...  You know, it's just...  It's...  Look, I saw...  Growing up,  I saw my parents  fucking fight  and use me as pawns.  Those stories.  Use you as pawns.  As pawns.  You know, so...  That's a pawn, sure.  When I got divorced, I said...  Hold on, hold on.  I got to slow you down,  because it's worth telling again.  What was the one story 
[03:09:00]  where you were dropped off?  Which one?  Oh, there was a couple.  The one that my grandpa...  Or the one where...  They used you...  Oh, no.  Wait.  My dad would come  every other weekend.  No.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, help me out.  Or the Port Authority one.  No.  You were dropped off  on a stoop.  Listen, he's just got like  one after another.  Or were they...  Or you were used  so your father got arrested.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What was that story?  We were...  Like, my father was coming  to see us on Saturday  and we're all excited.  Yeah.  You know, because I'd go  in the fucking...  Out in the yard  and have a catch with him  and whatever. 
[03:09:30]  Oh, daddy's here.  I'm looking out the window.  You know, he gets out  of the cab or whatever.  Look, daddy's here.  He's walking across  the fucking yard  and all of a sudden...  Fucking...  And how old are you  before you...  Detectives jump out of bushes.  They handcuff him.  And the detectives  were in cahoots  with your mom, right?  No, the detectives  were freelancing that day.  But you know  what I'm saying?  It just shows how...  It just shows you how...  Use me for a joke. 
[03:10:00]  That's fine, but...  Yeah.  It just shows you  how sick your fucking mom was.  Yeah, how sick...  She's using the kids...  Yes.  ...as bait  to get the father over there  so he can get arrested.  That's fucking bad.  But that's not even  the worst one.  That was bad  because we were...  I mean, it was bad  we're at home.  We're looking at...  Okay, he gets arrested.  You can go to him.  You don't know  daddy's got whatever.  You can go to your room  and cry and get dad  out of the way.  Right.  But the one where  she got us on the bus  and took us to New York  from Jersey  so we could meet him  at the Port Authority  and we get on the bus 
[03:10:30]  and we're going into New York  and we're going to meet dad  and we get out  at the Port Authority  and the next thing you know,  oh, handcuffs again.  They got him again.  Did your dad ever learn?  Parents were so fucked up.  When she dumped us  at my grandmother's,  like she takes all three of us,  me and my brothers,  brings us to the front,  and brings us to her apartment,  my grandmother,  Tilly and Elizabeth,  who was the good grandparents,  knocks on the door,  Tilly opens the door  to my grandmother  and my mother goes,  I don't want him  and walks away. 
[03:11:00]  That one too.  See, that's abandonment issues.  So when you get along  with your ex-wife  is because now you know  you're doing it  for your kids  in the long run.  No, I get it to a point.  It would just be hard to do.  That's all.  What, the supreme sacrifice there?  You just do everything  for your kids?  It's kind of like  for your pool.  You have your, you know,  you make sure  your pool is clean.  Yes.  Do you get a Porsche dealer?  Huh?  Do you get a Porsche dealer?  Do I have a Porsche dealer?  Yeah.  What do you mean? 
[03:11:30]  I'm taking a chance  by taking a phone call  here right now.  What's your name, sir?  Hold on.  Rich DeMayo.  Rich DeMayo?  You know Rich DeMayo?  Yeah.  Is this bad?  No, I don't know.  Is this from Porsche?  Yes.  New Rock just took it  because he liked his name.  Wait, are you the guys  that do my car?  No, no, no, no.  I was the guy  that sold you the car.  No, you didn't sell me  my Porsche.  I bought the Porsche  at a fucking auto auction.  Oh.  Oh.  What the fuck? 
[03:12:00]  Caught in a lie,  huh, Mr. DeMayo?  Do you sell Porsches?  Hey, he hung up.  I wanted to get one.  What was that all about?  He just went,  oh.  You realize he had  no fucking,  yeah.  I would have done  a deal with him  if he could get me  a fucking Cayman.  I went to a hard top Porsche.  There was a place  that lived,  well, fuck it,  I'll say,  it was the place  I was living in,  Huntington,  and the landlord  lived downstairs, 
[03:12:30]  had a couple daughters,  and was in a vicious,  vicious fucking situation  with his ex.  And he didn't bring  the kids back in time  or something,  and she called the cops,  and the cops were  on the front lawn  as they were yelling  and screaming at each other,  and the kids were just  fucking cowering.  Horrified.  Horrified.  I'm like,  why?  I don't understand.  Now that I'm a father,  you talk about  understanding stuff.  Now that I'm being a father,  I can't imagine  putting my kids  through that shit.  Yeah, who would do that?  I can't imagine  putting my kid through  half the shit 
[03:13:00]  that I was put through  growing up.  I can't imagine.  I'm sure there'll be  issues and stuff,  and God,  I hope I handle it right,  but you just can't imagine.  I can't,  but I gotta stop  fighting with Bonnie.  We have blowout fights  and the baby's there  and it doesn't hit me.  Then she'll go to Bonnie.  So you're doing  exactly what your  fucking parents do.  Right there?  You're doing it right there.  Well, no.  And eventually  you two will be  getting a divorce  and you're gonna be  right in the same situation.  And the baby will go,  are you happy, Mommy?  And then,  oh, look what I'm married to.  Are you and Bonnie  getting along? 
[03:13:30]  Yeah, we're getting along now.  Better?  Now?  What changed it?  It's a new day.  You know?  We haven't talked today.  It's a new day?  How vague is that?  You live in a day,  a moment at a time.  You know what I'm saying?  So now is a moment  where you're getting along.  If you have one foot  in yesterday  and one in tomorrow,  you're pissing on today, folks.  A little fucking  AA talk right there.  You know what I'm saying?  Oh, is that it?  All right.  You live in a moment, baby.  Okay?  Do you see you and Bonnie 
[03:14:00]  going long term?  At least when the movie  comes out, I hope.  No.  Yeah, I do because  even though we fight,  we do,  we are, you know,  you know,  fucking we get along  and we're fucking,  we laugh and we...  He wanted to say  the word that starts with C.  Connected?  Oh.  Compatible?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You didn't want to say that?  Because it looked like  we're still...  No, I can say,  I know compatible.  I know a lot of fucking words, okay?  No, it just seemed like 
[03:14:30]  it froze up for a second.  Well, because I wanted  to get it out, you know.  I don't know,  you know,  if I believe in that  whole soulmate shit.  I think that's,  you know,  what the fuck?  What are the odds?  That you're going to find some...  Yeah, maybe that...  Maybe your soulmate  is on the other side  of the planet.  You'll never meet him.  Yeah.  Meet him?  You fucking...  I meant meet him.  Apostrophe E-M.  Not him.  M.  Maybe...  Which makes me laugh 
[03:15:00]  so fucking hard.  Yeah, shit.  It just makes me laugh  so fucking hard.  Yeah, we did start a church  when I was growing up.  Fucking stop bringing it up.  Started a what?  A church.  What do you mean  you started a what?  Oh, that's right, yeah.  My dad started a church.  He was a...  Really?  He was a preacher?  Not really.  What?  He was a landlord?  No.  What do you mean he started...  Oh, so you didn't have  to pay taxes?  Why didn't he just  grow a couple corn stalks? 
[03:15:30]  My dad always had  something going on, man.  That's, you know...  I guess on the up and up  more or less.  And I had to bring  the tax certificates,  whatever they were  fucking called.  Oh, the exemption?  Exemption, sorry.  Yeah, when I bought my stuff.  And he would get really mad  if I didn't use  the tax-exempt form  when I was buying my stuff.  It was basically a form  to say that you were  part of a church  and you didn't have  to pay taxes.  Scam! 
[03:16:00]  Scam!  Fucking candy.  Who's going to go  fill a form out for candy?  Exactly.  You had to do it  for everything?  Fill a form?  He made us all  fucking walk around  with forms.  You know what?  Yes, three pieces  of bazooka bubblegum,  please.  I don't remember...  Here's my form.  I remember...  What the fuck is this?  I remember I was  with my friends  and I was trying  to buy new  basketball sneakers.  I was big-time  into basketball.  Oh, that's embarrassing.  And I got in trouble  when I got home  because I was mortified  to pull out the form  in front of my friends  in high school. 
[03:16:30]  You think that was...  And he got really mad.  I'm like,  how do you...  I can't do that.  You know what?  I got to hang out  with these guys.  I had to have  lunch tickets in school.  Yeah.  That was the worst  when you couldn't afford...  And I used to hide them  under the tray  and slip them  the lunch ticket.  You know?  Yeah, but you got  a good fucking  warm, nice meal, no?  Yeah.  But I was white.  I was...  We never got to  buy lunch at school.  No.  So I had the shitty lunch  in the...  In your cement bag.  So, you know, 
[03:17:00]  the good thing about  what your dad did  nowadays in New York,  you could go online  and become like  an ordained minister  or whatever,  and you could park  anywhere you want  in New York  if you have that.  That is absolutely untrue.  Absolutely untrue.  Some kid told me  he's got...  He's a minister  and he can park  anywhere.  How do you just park...  How do they know  you're some kind of  fucking bishop?  Because he has...  How do you just say  you put it in your  fucking window or...  Ministers can't just  park anywhere?  Yeah, you never know  when you have a fucking  emergency exorcism 
[03:17:30]  or whatever.  You don't fucking know.  They can park, man.  I'm telling you.  You cannot fuck with...  You can't fuck  with the clergy.  What else would they  be doing in New York  where they need to  have parking?  You can park anywhere  as a mission.  What else are they doing?  I don't know.  Maybe they're going in  throwing their fucking  blessings on shit.  Who the fuck knows  how you guys operate?  See, now you're  insulting the Catholics  out there.  What's that?  You're insulting us Catholics.  I'm not saying...  I'm saying who knows.  Just throwing blessings  on shit?  Really?  That's what you'd see it as? 
[03:18:00]  No.  This is real stuff to us.  It is?  Catholics.  You know, at one time  the Catholic Church  owned the most property  in Manhattan.  I don't know if they still do.  And birds would fly over.  That's crickets.  Oh, crickets?  Yes.  Wait, let me...  All right, wait.  I'll have an open mind, Rich.  I hear crickets.  Yeah, that's not a bird.  Maybe it's a bird  with a fucking... 
[03:18:30]  Ready to swoop down  and eat the cricket.  Okay.  They're saying my dad's church  was called  the Church of Latter-day Gingers.  Fucking assholes.  Oh, Steve from Bayshore  saying,  I didn't know  my song was going  to make Vos cry.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  I told Steve  I'm not crying.  Wah!  Don't play the song  the Elvis song.  Wah!  Maybe, you know what, 
[03:19:00]  after I buy  some Where to Al  fucking albums  I'll listen to his stuff.  You know,  when I'm going down  the parody line  of fucking music.  You know what?  I'm going to have to go  with Paul Bond  over you.  Wow.  Because he has more charisma  and he's easier  to look at.  Then I'll go to  your stuff, Steve.  You know what?  I don't...  Maybe...  I just want to  acknowledge  the brilliance  that is Rich Vos.  For the old school listeners,  they're dying somewhere. 
[03:19:30]  Damn.  You did not go  to Paul Bond.  He brought Paul Bond  out of fucking  cryogenic freezing  and brought him  back to the show.  There's a few good ones.  What was your favorite  Paul Bond?  The one I wrote  for him.  The one I gave him.  You wrote one for him?  I gave him, yeah.  From the song  Baby, you're all  that I want  when I'm lying  here in bed.  I find it hard  to believe  that you're seven.  You know,  there are a lot  of children  that are abused  and for you to fucking...  Well, they shouldn't  be out at comedy clubs. 
[03:20:00]  Say shit like that.  If they've been abused  and they're seven...  I am offended.  You know what gets me?  Did you read the story  about the fucking mother  that left her daughter  home as she went  to the baby  with her ex-boyfriend?  The mom left  the daughter  with the ex-boyfriend  who proceeded  to rape  her 12-year-old daughter  while she was  at her new boyfriend's house.  Gee, I wonder  where this was.  Huh?  Where was this?  I don't know.  It's just...  Why are people...  Greenwich, Connecticut? 
[03:20:30]  No.  See, I picked...  Never mind, Rich.  Why, you picked  a rich area?  Yeah.  It didn't happen there.  Exactly.  It's called  extreme sarcasm.  Dr. Steve wants  in on this so bad.  Dr. Steve, yes.  Hey, guys.  Hi.  I just...  I think you missed  the boat  on the Porsche call.  Oh, what happened there?  When the guy  called in,  he said,  hey, Rich,  I sold you my Porsche  and Rich said,  I didn't buy my Porsche  from you. 
[03:21:00]  I bought it  from an auction  and the guy goes,  oh,  and hangs up.  I mean,  that tells the whole story.  Why?  Because it's a German car?  No,  because you wasted  some fucking Porsche  dealer's time  and then it's showing you cars  and then you went  to an auction  and bought your car.  No,  that's 100%.  Oh,  so you're thinking  that guy  was the guy  that was trying  to sell Rich  a Porsche  at a real dealership.  No,  see,  this is where  you're wrong.  Doc,  this is where  you're wrong  on that  because when I  bought the Porsche, 
[03:21:30]  I went to the auto auction.  I didn't have any car  in mind.  I just wanted  another sports car  and the Porsche  was going through the line.  I go,  put a bin in on that  to the dealer  and I got the car.  I never looked at Porsches  before I bought the car,  but that would be  a good scenario  if that was the case.  But you knew  the guy,  right?  No,  who,  the guy that just called?  Yeah.  No,  I said I knew him  to see who the fuck  I,  I meet hundreds of people.  I'm a semi-celebrity.  By the way,  Dr. Steve,  we had a penis emergency  but the guy hung up 
[03:22:00]  so please stand by  if,  stay close to your phone.  We might have  a penis emergency today.  Okay,  absolutely.  He wants to know  what he could get  from blowjobs,  I think,  was his question.  Oh,  God.  Bad taste in his mouth?  Fuck you,  Foss.  That's a good  stock line though.  There's nothing wrong  with that. 
[03:22:30]  All right.  Oh,  fucking Rick.  Steve,  hold on one second  because now,  you know,  I,  I,  let's go to Sean  in Georgia.  Sean.  Hey,  Rick,  what the fuck  is a weird  Al?  Weird Al.  Weird Al.  Oh,  geez,  they call you out  on everything.  You have a brother,  right?  Yeah.  Does he look like you?  Yeah,  why?  I don't know,  I'd like to like  get some fucking  family stories  with your brother,  that'd be kind of cool.  His phone,  I think his phone's  cut off and  I don't know. 
[03:23:00]  Wow,  okay.  My sister's pretty,  uh,  wait,  so am I supposed  to bunt or swing away?  I don't know what those,  I don't know what that meant.  What are those signals?  Bunt?  No,  I mean,  take the next pitch,  what am I doing?  He's too busy,  he's working,  you know,  I have a sister  that's always busy,  they're not into  this type of stuff.  We got a penis  emergency coming in,  let's say hi to,  Dr. Steve's on one line  and we got Steve  in Jersey.  Steve.  Hey,  Dr. Steve.  Yeah,  man. 
[03:23:30]  You there?  I'm here.  I just recently  found a lump  on my testicle.  Oh.  Um,  I went to the doctor  and they said  it's something called  like a spermatocel.  Have you heard of that?  Yeah,  absolutely.  Okay.  So it's just some  right of it,  do you want me?  Well,  I got,  I got some,  you think you can fly  up to Jersey  and maybe squeeze it,  Dr. Steve,  for the next batch  of your wine?  He makes sense. 
[03:24:00]  Now,  spermatocel is a,  it's a cyst that forms  in the vas deferens,  which is the tube  that goes from the,  from the innards to the,  I mean,  from the testicles  to the inside the body.  And you could get  a little cyst of sperm cells  in there  and it's just called  a spermatocel  and it's sperm cells  and other fluid  that's produced.  This guy,  loads though,  to blast that shit out.  Who's this kid called?  What's the guy's name  that's calling? 
[03:24:30]  What's your name?  Steve in Jersey.  Steve,  here's a,  like,  I'm not a professional,  but a lot of time  when you go to the doctor  and the doctor will tell you  what you have,  that's maybe when you ask  the fucking questions.  What is it?  You fucking jackass.  You don't wait for two weeks  to call on radio.  You don't call  a fucking radio show  to find out  what's wrong with you.  You are already  at the doctor's office.  You fucking faggot.  Shut your mouth.  Go follow your nuts  and it falls off.  I wanted his opinion.  It's not an opinion.  You got a cyst, 
[03:25:00]  you jackass.  The doctor told,  oh,  really?  Can I have another opinion?  It's not a car.  It's not a fucking  pair of sneakers.  It's your fucking nuts.  So when the doctor's  telling you there's  something wrong  with your nuts,  you go,  okay,  how do you fix it?  You don't call  a radio show  for your fucking  health tips,  you fucking idiot,  and I'm the idiot.  Oh,  I hope you're fucking,  I hope you piss puss.  Oh,  that's not nice,  Rich.  That's not the wrong,  I'm glad you got  your information. 
[03:25:30]  All right,  very good.  We got another  penis emergency.  You know what,  Kevin from Connecticut  is saying,  we definitely need  a stinger that says  penis emergency,  means something,  you know.  Penis emergency.  I need one.  Richard in Chicago.  Hey,  how you doing,  guys?  Hey,  man.  All right,  so I got a question  for Dr. Steve.  I got something  called hydrodinitis  and hydrodinitis  superativa.  Yeah,  I think I'm pronouncing  it right.  They removed my thighs. 
[03:26:00]  I had excisions done  and I had some skin graft  done and now it is  starting on my balls.  What?  I'm getting,  what?  I'm getting,  what was removed?  His thighs?  Dr. Steve,  all right,  hold on there a minute.  You had your inner thigh  removed?  Dr. Steve,  what is this?  It's a wind tunnel.  And how do I never,  ever get it?  I get Danny to bring up  a picture of hydrodinitis  superativa.  Well,  the good news  is he can ride  horses better.  Yeah,  he can.  He snaps on  like a plastic cowboy. 
[03:26:30]  He's a scope  for midgets.  My pain is amusing.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Richard,  I'm sorry.  I'm calling it  Opie and Anthony.  I haven't had a good line  all day.  I just went in before  fucking 1030.  So now it's on your ball's  old nutcracker legs?  What the fuck? 
[03:27:00]  What are these diseases  come from?  What is this?  What are we looking at?  It's congenital,  I believe.  My sister was born  with it already.  Oh,  what the fuck?  I'm not looking at that.  I'm not looking at that picture.  Come on,  Danny.  Jesus Christ.  What is this?  Hey,  bro,  let me tell him one thing.  There is a new treatment  for hydratonitis.  It doesn't require  surgery and stuff.  Yeah,  it's called a fucking 38. 
[03:27:30]  I'm just going to  shout this over them  so you can hear it.  Oh,  Jesus Christ.  Humor and approach  is back for help.  He's the only one  that stays on  the banana boat,  right?  Jesus Christ.  Got to go to  the Caribbean  to get that joke.  What,  Dr. Steve?  I'll just tell him  to email me  and I'll send him  all the information.  What causes this?  Dr. Steve,  what causes this?  Nobody knows  what causes this.  Oh,  I hate those ones.  Yeah,  probably hereditary though 
[03:28:00]  and it causes  just the worst  kind of,  it's acne type  lesions  and a lot of people  get them in their arms.  Yeah.  People can get them  in their thighs.  It tends to be places  where there are creases  in the skin  and it's,  for the people  that have it,  it's very debilitating.  Of course,  if you lose  your inner thighs.  I mean,  they had to put me  on disability  because of it.  It's like my body  is allergic  to its own sweat.  Does it,  Jesus?  When you're walking,  does it look like  you're getting ready  for a gunfight? 
[03:28:30]  Yeah,  it's like cream cheese  down there,  man.  It's bad.  I mean,  to get put on disability  for thighs,  that's really,  really bad.  Oh,  that's got to be  fucking horrible.  The thing that concerns  me the most  is that after they  excised my thighs,  I guess it went  into remission  for a few months  and then it started  like on my butt crack  and I would get them  like inside my ass crack  but now that it's  moved to my balls,  I don't have them  in my ass crack anymore.  I'd rather have them  in my ass crack.  You know,  I just,  I don't know what to do.  What a choice 
[03:29:00]  to have to make.  What the hell  about I rather?  Well,  you know,  what I'm thinking  is you're not getting  fucked either way.  No,  he's getting fucked.  That's fucking hard.  I feel so bad.  He's getting  the ultimate fuck.  Wow,  that is something.  You'd feel sorry  for a guy like this.  What is your email  address,  Dr. Steve?  I'd love to get  some information.  Go to drsteve.com  and you can email  me through there.  That's the best way  rather than just  giving it out over there.  But there's a new  treatment for that  and it looks pretty 
[03:29:30]  successful.  Sorry,  go ahead.  All right,  good.  So this is hope  for you,  Richard.  Email Dr. Steve.  Listen,  Dr. Steve,  when are you coming up?  Because we want  to do that fucking  what the hell  is that?  Yeah,  and we got to get  him to come up  and show us  that I drive  as something.  But Dr. Steve,  I'm going to forget.  Don't forget.  We got to do a  what the hell  is that  next time you're  in New York.  We're looking at  if we can do it  mid-October.  All right.  All right,  good.  Let's just get  another doctor.  We need to do  that sooner.  I feel bad for the  guy.  When there's 
[03:30:00]  something that  awful,  you can only  cover it with  humor because  you feel so  horrible for a  guy that,  you know,  I just cover it  with humor  because I'm  ready to fucking  like faint  thinking about it.  When he said  he had his  thighs removed.  And the sad  thing about it  is he had to  have all his  pants taken in.  It's so bad.  Just horrible.  Poor guy can't  wear spandex  anymore.  That would  look silly.  Hey, 
[03:30:30]  let's go to the  original penis  guy that started  the penis  emergency bit  on the show  today.  Larry.  Yeah,  I had a problem  with my cock.  The first part  was the blow  jobs.  What can you  get from a  blow job?  Second part  was for about  a week and a  half or two  weeks,  I would jerk  off,  it would feel  great,  and I just  would not  come.  I would come,  but it wouldn't  feel good.  I don't know.  I ride a bike.  I sit Indian  style. 
[03:31:00]  I don't know.  I don't know.  What do you have,  Dr. Steve?  Okay,  well,  the first thing,  I think it's  two separate  problems.  The easy one  is the second  one,  which was  when you're  having an  orgasm but  not coming,  you're probably  retrograde  ejaculating,  which means  it's going  into your  bladder instead  of coming  out the end  of your  penis.  That's  how long  do these  things happen.  That's  how long  it's  going.  Stop doing  it. 
[03:31:30]  Don't come  into your  bladder.  Stop it.  Just stop  doing that.  Stop that.  Why does my  piss look like  semen?  I've noticed  that, too.  My piss  was a lot  more thick,  like milkshake.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  You know what?  Got any  bourbon in it?  You guys  make me feel  good about  my sniffles.  Yeah, that's  it.  You just  got a  fucking  runny nose.  This guy's  coming into  his piss  bag. 
[03:32:00]  Wow.  Yeah, there's  a lot of  medications that  can cause  retrograde  ejaculation.  Trauma can  cause it.  Yeah, sitting  on a...  It's been  proposed that  bicycle riding  can cause it  just because of  the pressure  that's put on  the taint.  Tying your  dick in a  knot.  But if  trauma could  cause it,  when that's  happening,  wouldn't that  cause more  trauma and  just escalate?  It's kind of  like getting  trauma.  Physical  trauma he's  talking about.  Oh, those  mental trauma.  Someone scared 
[03:32:30]  him and he  started cumming  into his  bladder.  Fucking  rich, come  on.  Boom, where's  my cum?  That only  happened once.  All right.  Thanks, Larry.  Email Dr.  Steve.  Well, we  should talk  about what  you can get  from a blowjob.  You can get  just about any  sexually transmitted  disease.  A smile?  Or HIV.  Yeah, and a  smile.  Yeah, HIV.  HIV, it's  got to be  pretty rare,  right? 
[03:33:00]  Is there an  app for that?  As far as I  know, there's  never been a  case of saliva  transmitted HIV.  Thank you.  Blowjobs are  pretty safe.  Blowjobs are  safe.  Blowjobs are  safe.  A little  penicillin  we'll take  care of.  This is an  old,  stanky,  hack question.  If a girl  had a cold  sore, you  could get  herpes.  Yeah.  So that  mouth cold  sore can turn  into genital  herpes?  Let me show  you.  Let me show  you.  Motherfucker. 
[03:33:30]  All right,  Larry, you're  good, Larry,  you're good.  How can  that old  tale about  like if a  mosquito carries  blood, how  come you can't  catch age from  a mosquito?  Yeah, it  just doesn't  work that way,  and that's a  really interesting  question.  But, you  know, there  may be some  enzyme in the  mosquito's stomach  that neutralizes  the virus, or  you know, I  don't know, but  you know, this  dengue fever,  you were  talking about  the other  day?  The dengue  fever, Dr. 
[03:34:00]  Steve.  I have a  dengue fever.  What's that?  You know, we're  seeing that in  Mexico, and it's  working its way up  into the United  States.  Yeah, that's  wonderful, isn't  it?  We eradicated  that.  Of course we  did.  We're amazing as  a country, and  then savages come  up here with the  dengue fever.  I don't want the  dengue fever here.  They all come from  the fucking Far  East.  And bedbugs from  India.  They call it  bone-cracking  fever because it  makes your  joints.  Oh, Jesus.  Bone-cracking  fever? 
[03:34:30]  Jesus.  Yep.  What they call  it.  All right.  Listen, one  more.  Great movie.  Gino from  Philly, he  writes, OPS,  Dr. Steve,  about, I'm  going to  mispronounce  this,  pylonidyl  cyst?  Pylonidyl  cyst.  Okay.  Before you get  into it, I've got  to go.  Why?  You don't want  to hear how you  can get extra  holes in your  asshole?  No, no, no.  I'm going.  I got a dentist's  appointment.  Uncle Vinny's this  weekend, Mardi Gras,  next Wednesday,  Thursday, Scottsdale,  Arizona.  This was fun.  Dr. Steve, thank you  for all your info. 
[03:35:00]  Guys, it's always a  pleasure.  Thank you, Rich.  Are you tweeting,  Rich?  There goes Rich Voss.  Not really?  Yeah, once in a while.  All right.  Well, I'm just trying  to make sure the plugs  get out there nice.  Uncle Vinny's where  again?  Point Pleasant Friday  and Saturday.  All right, that's a  big one.  Mardi Gras is in  Arizona, Scottsdale,  next weekend.  Thank you, Rich.  We'll play golf soon.  Two weeks.  All right, there goes  Rich Voss.  There he goes,  off to the dentist  who should get  hazard pay.  I don't know what 
[03:35:30]  it is, but I fucking  love when Rich comes  in.  I just picture  his dentist coming  over to the chair  dressed like the guy  in the hurt locker.  You think he sees  Rich Voss on his  schedule?  It's like, oh,  here it comes.  Not today.  It's fucking Voss  coming in?  I'm not in the mood.  Jesus Christ.  And I'm fucking  short.  I'm fucking short  and I gotta do  Voss today?  Right.  Yeah, what is that 
[03:36:00]  thing that Gino  brought up?  A pilonidyl cyst.  That's a cyst above  the ass crack.  Above the ass crack.  Okay.  That you're basically  born with.  It's just a little  pouch that never  sealed off when you  were an embryo.  Oh, I've known  people that have  had that.  Yeah, it can fill  up with pus.  And the weird thing  is it fills up with  hair.  And so, like, you  can take tweezers  and pull these just  long two-foot hairs  out of these.  Kind of sounds fun. 
[03:36:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's not as  disgusting as  hydratonitis  subretinitis.  I've known people  that have had that  and said it's so  fucking painful.  Yeah.  They have to be  surgically removed  if they cause you  problems.  A lot of people  just live with it.  Why would you  just live with it?  Well, if it doesn't  cause any, if it's  not causing you pain  or it's not draining  pus or anything like  that, you've just  got a potential space  there.  It's not that big of  a deal.  But, you know, if  it fills up with 
[03:37:00]  pus and starts  leaking and  causing pain and  hairs start coming  out of it and all  that stuff, it's  pretty gross.  I just have it.  Oh, God, I'm  going to throw up.  Yeah.  This is so  fucking disgusting.  I don't know how  you do your line  of work.  I don't know how  you do it.  Dude, I can eat  through all of that  stuff.  I can eat through  it.  You're amazing.  No problem.  You're amazing.  All right.  Weird Medicine is  the website.  No, drsteve.com.  Oh, drsteve.com. 
[03:37:30]  It's a good little  website.  All the information on  Weird Medicine is on  there.  Sure.  And then Weird  Medicine on our  channel next Saturday  night at midnight.  Right on.  All right.  We're finally done  with you, Dr.  Steve.  Okay.  Enjoy spending the  morning with you.  Jesus.  Yeah, I know, right?  And everyone is  calling with their  issues.  That's why Dr.  Steve has that  fine show on our  channel.  He's got his show  if you want to.  And he makes it  fun and funny at  times.  Listen to his show  and call in with  your problems.  And when he does his  next New York  visit, we're going  to do What the  Hell is That?  I think that will  be the third version 
[03:38:00]  of that.  Yeah.  I could come up  before, and we'll  talk about this out  here, I could come  up before October.  I was just trying to  work it in with a  live Weird Medicine  show.  No, come up before,  man.  Okay.  Okay, I can do  that.  Great.  I'll throw some  money towards the  Dr.  Steve flying up to  New York fund.  Oh, shit.  I can, I have, I  have miles.  I can do that.  Yeah, but whatever.  We'll have a good  time, do a little  dinner, you know.  All right, Dr.  Steve.  Thank you, sir.  Yeah, we got to do  What the Hell is That  sooner than later.  Oh, hell yeah.  All right, let's break  and get into some fun 
[03:38:30]  stuff after the break.  Right.  We can't leave on a  Friday on this note.  Yes, we can.  No, we can't.  Of course we can't.  We'll do some fun  stuff next.  Yes. </pre>
