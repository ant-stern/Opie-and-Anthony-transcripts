<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a scathing, vulgar attack on "The Dopey and Agni Show,"  referring to their followers as "violent extremists" and employing numerous offensive insults.  This transitioned into a recurring bit mocking co-worker E-Rock's repeated announcements of taking a shit.  A roll call confirmed the presence of Jim Norton, Sam Roberts, Danny Ross, Aki, and Eric Nagel in studio, with Greg Hughes absent.  A darkly humorous, sexually graphic discussion of military memorial rituals followed.

The anticipated arrival of guest Robert Kelly was met with jeers ("Boo, Bobby, boo").  A story about Kelly's disastrous Super Bowl party hosting skills, contrasted with the enjoyment of his wife's snacks, led to a lengthy, graphic discussion of morbid obesity, featuring descriptions of weight loss surgery, a woman who allegedly sat on a toilet for years, and grotesque images displayed by the crew. This segment was heavily punctuated by offensive language and vulgar jokes.

Daryl Hammond was mentioned as an upcoming guest, sparking a conversation about his book and past addiction struggles.  This evolved into a discussion about the perceived attractiveness of women in rehab, and the hosts' views on sex and their own experiences, described in terms with drug-like qualities.

The hosts then expressed frustration with listener-submitted content, specifically unsolicited pictures and links of previously seen material.  This triggered a discussion on sneakers, race, and materialism, marked by offensive language and stereotypes.  The conversation delved into their personal experiences with racism, including frequent use of racial slurs within their families. This segment was extremely graphic and contained extremely offensive language.

Jim Norton shared a harrowing account of his racist upbringing, detailing the casual use of racial slurs and its impact. The conversation expanded to include homophobic slurs and descriptions of violent arguments witnessed in his childhood.

The show continued its discussion on race relations in America, utilizing offensive language, graphic descriptions, and derogatory stereotypes.  A caller, James, challenged their perspective, leading to a final discussion about their own experiences and limitations in understanding other cultures.  The show concluded with a brief, lighthearted anecdote about a party attended by one of the hosts.


A later segment featured Bob Kelly filling in for Opie. The conversation focused on a UFC fight between Nick Diaz and Carlos Condit, expressing disappointment in Condit's points-based strategy.  They discussed the announced rematch and their anticipation for a more aggressive fight.  A caller's frustrating Super Bowl experience, involving a friend turning the TV on and off repeatedly and a difficult post-game wheelchair experience, led to a digression playing a scene from *Kiss of Death* depicting an elderly woman being pushed down stairs.  The caller also discussed his walkie-talkie use and dislike of Chris Collinsworth. Daryl Hammond later joined, discussing his new book detailing his experiences with childhood abuse, flashbacks, confrontations with his mother, and legal repercussions.  The conversation touched upon mental illness, the roles of his parents, and incidents of being threatened and stalked.

Another segment featured Daryl Hammond discussing his book, "God, if you're not up there, I'm fucked," sharing anecdotes from his life, including encounters with Dick Cheney and Bill Clinton. He described his impression creation methods, and recounted a harrowing childhood story involving his mother and a knife, and a frightening experience in a Caribbean jail.  He also shared humorous *Saturday Night Live* mishaps.  Bobby Kelly then joined, promoting his podcast. The hosts discussed Patrice O'Neal's new comedy album and Ty's horror film, "The Innkeepers," and its premiere in the haunted hotel where it was filmed. The conversation concluded with discussions of haunted hotels and paranormal experiences.  The segment included numerous instances of vulgar language and potentially offensive jokes, along with "Opie and Anthony F.U. line" segments.

A further segment centered on a host's frightening experience with unexplained noises, which led to a humorous discussion about ghosts, their appearance (stereotypically old white people, with a lack of diversity noted), activities (including suggestions of ghost rape), and the credibility of ghost hunting shows like *Ghost Adventures* and *Paranormal State*, specifically criticizing Chip Coffey.  Bigfoot and UFOs were also discussed, with skeptical commentary on related evidence.  The conversation included frequent use of crude and offensive language.  The segment ended with plugs for a movie premiere, stand-up shows, and sponsors.

Finally, a segment featured a rapid-fire series of Valentine's Day gift advertisements, including Steven Singer roses, Shari's Berries, Pajamagram, and Vermont Teddy Bear, interspersed with the hosts' banter, including a running gag about misreading phone numbers and a humorous exchange about forgetting Valentine's Day.  No guests were present during this segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The Dopey and Agni Show, their followers are violent extremists.  I would have ripped this car off!  They use every derogatory term on the planet, but they can't argue or debate.  You're a waste of life, you fucking pig!  The Dopey and Agni Show is a slot machine.  You have lovely, giant breasts.  My nipples are kind of hard right now.  Fuck yeah!  They were like little lizards licking at their foots.  That's what they done.  It's fucking brilliant.  The Dopey and Agni Show, they breed violent extremists. 
[00:00:30]  They call that humor for some reason.  Welcome to the program!  These people are not part of the human race.  These are anti-human.  They be suck-a-tits or something.  That's what they're all, they're picking on the most vulnerable in society.  Junkie-dunkie-fad-fad.  How dare you question the Dopey and Agni Show?  Get used to it, man.  Let's go fuck and have a good time, really!  But enough of this palaver!  Let's get the show on the road!  Oh, yes. 
[00:01:00]  No palaver here.  Nine palaver.  Amy.  Amy.  Uh, hi.  Dopey and Agni Show.  Where's, um...  Z-Rock?  Z-Rock around?  Uh...  I don't know if it's the reflection, or...  Is he, um...  Yeah?  E-Rock is taking a shit. 
[00:01:30]  E-Rock is taking a shit.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, good morning.  Good morning, everybody.  I guess, uh, well E-Rock's back in, he tried sliding back in, so he couldn't get the, uh,  the shit sweeper, but we, we put it in there anyway.  I knew he was back, but I just want everyone to know that he was just taking a shit.  So it fell into the plus or minus, give or take, he was taking a shit. 
[00:02:00]  Is there another one?  Oh, there's another one?  E-Rock is taking a shit.  E-Rock is taking a shit.  Why is it so mechanical?  Why is it such a major announcement?  Yeah.  Yeah, well, that's supposed to let everybody know that he's indeed out and not at his post.  He deserts his post when he has to take a dump like that.  We'll look up and have a music bet or something, and we'll just see an empty booth, 
[00:02:30]  and then someone says, sweetie's making a doo-doo.  Yeah, yeah, sweetie's making a doo-doo.  Well, yeah, Opie and Anthony's show.  Is Opie absent today?  Let's take attendance.  Anthony, here.  Jim Norton?  Here.  Jim Norton's here.  Yeah, yeah, I'm blowing my nose.  Sam Roberts?  Present.  Danny Ross?  Here.  All right.  Mars? 
[00:03:00]  Aki.  Oh, Aki.  Eric Nagel?  Eric Nagel.  Good morning.  Greg Hughes?  Greg Hughes?  Hughes?  No, see?  He's, uh, I think he's out then.  That's how they, um, did you ever see them, I saw them do that in a show, in a soldier's  wake?  Oh, right.  Yeah, they do that.  Where they, they announce everybody, uh, like, they're terrible.  And the soldier's here! 
[00:03:30]  They all stand up, except the one who's, the wake they're at, and then it's just silent,  and it's like, ugh.  Yeah, it's like, holy fuck.  They know he's not gonna say here.  That would be creepy, if some dick in the back went here.  Some, some prankster?  Yeah.  A prankster at a wake.  Just ruin the effect.  Here.  No, that's terrible.  It was, it's chilling when they do that, though.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's chilling.  Anytime they do that, the missing man formation with the planes, you know, anytime.  The, the riderless horse, that thing, you know. 
[00:04:00]  They did that for Kennedy, you know that.  I think they, don't they do that for every dead president?  I think with Kennedy, they actually had an intern, uh, whose vagina was just empty.  There was no one in it.  They had the horse actually fuck her, because the horse was tense.  They had that beardsly girl upside down in the back of a horse with her feet in the air.  Do the horse a favor.  He's, he's tense.  The horse is tense.  He's got his hooves in the pool water. 
[00:04:30]  He hasn't had any oats.  Why do I sound Irish?  He's getting his hooves.  Yes, very tense.  Uh, I guess, uh, we got Robert Kelly coming in a little, uh, in a little bit.  Boo, Bobby, boo.  Well, I would like to get his take on, uh, on the Patriots.  You know, he's a big Boston guy, and, uh, we heard from Jimmy, who was over his house  during the Super Bowl, that he was, uh, none too pleased with, uh, the Pats performance  in the Super Bowl.  He was a horrible host. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  His wife was fun.  They made a lot of, she made a lot of delicious snacks.  Oh, she did.  Yeah.  I bet she has to know how to make a lot of delicious snacks.  Oh, you bet she does.  That's a prerequisite.  Yeah, there's a big, they all have hay in them, though, for some reason, for him.  But, uh, yeah, we had a nice time with Bob and his friend, and, and, whose name I don't  remember, and myself and his wife.  Yeah.  But, uh, as the game progressed.  I, but I got it.  I wasn't mad.  Like, I, I, I'm a fan of, so I understand being a twat when your team is losing. 
[00:05:30]  That is true, man.  It is, uh, infuriating.  He was, but he was just at the TV.  I, what the fuck?  Turn the volume down, because we wouldn't have to hear Chris Collins.  I'm like, we don't want to just listen to you.  Put the volume on you.  You turn the volume back up and annoyed him.  Oh, yeah, what, that was when he went downstairs.  I was turning up so he could hear Chris Collinsworth.  Eli Manning really threaded a needle there.  Yeah, well, you know, Chris.  Was he just downstairs going, shut that off, Dave?  Did I show you the picture of him?  No.  What is he, annoyed?  Yeah, of course.  He's like, don't Twitter pictures of my house.  So I didn't.  Why? 
[00:06:00]  He was just upset.  Aw.  No matter what I was trying to do.  Poor Bobby.  I tried to call him on our, uh, Super Bowl wrap-up show that we were doing, uh, from my house.  Oh.  And, uh, he wouldn't answer the phone.  It just went to a message, and a bunch of drunks just yelled into the, uh, mics,  Dad, Dad, Dad.  By the way, that's up on, uh, iTunes right now, the Super Bowl wrap-up show.  Hold on one second.  Go there and check that out.  I have this picture somewhere.  Angry Bobby.  But we did get Bill Burr on the phone.  So, uh, that was, that was pretty fun. 
[00:06:30]  That's Bob in his bed downstairs.  Oh, no.  Look at him.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God.  He looks like one of those people that can't get out of bed.  Like, they have to pull him through a wall when, if he's sick.  He literally, that doesn't look flattering.  No.  He looks like, all he needs is a little garbage around him, and he's a hoarder.  And a house dress.  Like, he needs to be wearing a one-piece house dress.  A moo-moo.  Yeah, a big moo-moo.  That's what he says.  No, I don't. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  That's what he, ah, Danny just pulled up a picture of some big fatty in bed.  But his leg is all the way out to the left.  Is that because he can't go in front of him?  It looks chopped off.  Yeah, fat people end up doing a split, which is kind of ironic since they're fat and shouldn't be nimble.  But the fatter they get, even when they're sitting in a seat, a chair, it looks like they're doing a split, like a frog or Humpty Dumpty or something.  I don't know what it is.  I was watching that show, that 600-pounder show on, is it TLC, that one? 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, yeah.  That TLC is fucking fantastic.  And they had this, it's like the people that weigh 600 pounds, and then they had to lose it.  And this show ran a course of something like seven years.  They did this documentary on this woman, and she lost the fucking weight.  She went from 600 pounds down to, like, you know, normal person weight.  But she went through so many horrific operations to remove excess skin.  Oh, wow.  She got infections and stuff.  It was just, it's not an easy thing to do. 
[00:08:00]  You can't just stop eating and lose weight.  But who is she?  Now, is she married?  She was married to some enabling fucking guy.  Of course.  Who wasn't fat initially.  Oh, God.  That person looks like pizza.  Uh, yeah.  She was married to some enabling guy.  And the second she started, she got her stomach stapled, you know?  And right when she did that, before she lost any weight, the husband starts, like, hitting it with things like,  Oh, you're just going to leave me, you know?  Oh, yuck. 
[00:08:30]  You know, I took care of her for all these years.  Now I don't know what to do.  I don't think she needs me anymore.  Like, just that whole me thing.  It was all about him.  Him and his knees.  And he was a caretaker and afraid of being left.  Oh, yuck.  He loved, loved when she became incapacitated and couldn't even move out of her bed because then she depended completely on him.  And that was that.  And in the end, I think the marriage did just end.  She stopped fucking that black guy in the neighborhood.  Yeah, just, just started, when her ass reached the point where it was actually, you know, attractive to a black gentleman. 
[00:09:00]  After she lost 10 pounds.  600, 590 pounds is really where it should be.  Yeah, she, she started losing weight and then they had to cut off the excess skin.  They showed her, she lifted up her house dress and this giant, it looked like a giant lumpy scrotum fell out from between her legs.  And she goes, yeah, that's a fat, fat fucking lump. 
[00:09:30]  And that has to be removed.  I think it was growing off the inside of her thigh.  Just disgusting things happen to fat people.  Yeah, when you get to be that morbidly obese, it really is amazing.  It's amazing to me that somebody still feeds you, that somebody still, how do you tolerate somebody sitting on a toilet for two years?  Ah.  You don't bring them food, they're getting up to eat.  Yeah.  But there's oil, some enabler.  Oh, is that real?  Is that fucking legit?  Yeah, she looks happy. 
[00:10:00]  Did you see that story, Jimmy?  You just mentioned getting off the toilet, that Chinese woman that was sitting on the toilet for like five years.  I think it was longer than that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was ridiculous.  Sat on the toilet.  Yeah, and she said something like, I think in the article it said that when asked why she wouldn't leave, she just said that every time she tried to get up to leave, she just felt a force pulling her back down onto the toilet.  A force.  And she ate all of her meals there and only left the toilet to shower, and she only showered eight times over the course of that time.  Wow.  How do you do that?  And the husband, how does the husband...  What do you do on the toilet all day? 
[00:10:30]  What kind of a butthickey must you get?  What if she closed the lid at all?  Oh, yeah, you think she sits on there?  I thought Dana was going to say when she gets up, she felt like she had a shit again.  It's like every time for years, you're like, all right, I'm going to, I think I got a shit.  I think there's some left.  I only hate that when you put so much effort into cleaning up, and you're like, fuck, I just wasted all that time and paper.  Yeah, yeah.  In the back of the fucking toilet.  But there's other words than that when you don't...  I took a shit recently.  How did we get here already?  Oh, I know, it just goes right to it.  Already, I was like, oh my God, after 6.20, we haven't touched this, we're going to lose people if we don't... 
[00:11:00]  And I felt a fleck of shit whip in the middle of my back.  I'm like, what happened?  How did that happen?  I don't know, it was horrible.  Wow, sometimes I can crawl up there.  No more shitting and head standing.  No, you can't do that.  She's not even as fat as other people except for her legs.  That one's disgusting.  What happens when the skin gets all crusty and flaky?  What is that?  Ah, man, there's just some kind of skin disease that happens.  Oh, it's terrible.  There's a lack of circulation.  It's like black and brown over...  Yeah, she's getting gangrene or some shit. 
[00:11:30]  Is that bed sores?  Is that what that is?  Maybe that's it, too.  Look at how awful her fucking mattress is.  Look at how beat down and just sad that mattress is.  Nothing, no springs could take that.  She needs shock absorber springs from fucking semis or something.  Oh, look at the legs.  I don't get it.  How did this woman look when she lost the weight?  I just think that might be a guy.  With clothes on, she looked kind of normal.  No.  Because I think I saw that show. 
[00:12:00]  Not the show Ant's talking about.  That show with that guy.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  That's a gal.  That one is, yeah.  There's just lumps of fat falling off the couch.  She's laying on the couch sideways trying to do a sexy pose.  But who, how do you, how do you not just kill her?  Yeah.  She looked normal with her clothes on and, but she, she was so scarred up front, back.  She looked like Frankenstein.  Because they had had to, they did so many operations to remove her excess skin that she was all cut up.  Like fucking scars everywhere on her. 
[00:12:30]  At one point they had like her back, they had to put drains all over her body to drain the fucking, like fluids that would just leak out of her.  The smells that must have come out of those.  From the infections.  Yeah, just fucking disgusting.  And, uh, yeah, that show is a winner.  Oh, man.  Is that, is that one of the scars from having your excess skin removed?  Oh, from the underarm?  Yeah.  It doesn't, they, they don't know how to do it and not leave giant scars and, and you still have this flabby, uh, skin on you, lasagna skin, giant scarring. 
[00:13:00]  Uh, it's no, um, it's no fix.  I guess the option is that you die 500 pounds.  I mean.  Right.  It's, it's, it's cosmetic.  I mean, you know, you could probably live a very good life if you fucking, I mean, how, how much did she get down to?  How much did that enchanting lady get down to?  Ah, like a hundred and something, you know, she was, she was under 200 pounds.  She, uh, she didn't look all that bad, uh, with clothes on, like I said, but, you know, she looked human at least. 
[00:13:30]  When she was that fat, people that fat walk around, they're just freaks of nature.  People just look at them like they're fucking freaks.  Yeah.  Bobby's gonna love coming in after this conversation.  And doesn't he listen to the show on his way in and shit?  If you went from Bob Kelly coming in to other morbidly obese people.  Other morbidly obese.  You're implying that he is indeed morbidly obese.  Well, that's where the conversation naturally went. 
[00:14:00]  It's an observation.  Bob Kelly to fat people to shitting.  Right.  Yeah.  Uh, God.  But, well, uh, we also have Daryl Hammond coming in.  He's coming in at 8 o'clock.  I forgot my book.  God damn it.  Oh, did you forget your book?  I finished the essay.  I loved it.  Do you think, uh, Roland has an extra copy maybe?  And he could get that signed?  Now, I, uh, didn't read the book.  I'm not.  You didn't do your homework.  I'm not one of them readers.  Yeah.  And, uh, I didn't do homework in school when it was really important.  So, I don't, I don't do homework for work. 
[00:14:30]  I don't read books and whatnot.  I like a good periodical.  I like a good magazine.  I'll read the shit out of a magazine.  So, if Daryl Hammond were promoting an article he had written about himself.  Oh, yeah.  I'd know everything.  I see.  Front to back on that one.  But anything with a hard cover on it, uh, no.  Anything with a thick bunch of pages, I can't, uh, I can't do it.  I, I, I don't mind reading them when I, once I start.  I just can't get started.  I look at a book and go, pfft, no fucking way. 
[00:15:00]  It's intimidating.  The only times I've read books is when I've picked them up and start reading it for some  reason.  And then, uh, I'm like, oh, this is kind of good.  I'm, I'm imagining this and making pictures in my head like a movie, but it's in my head.  I don't know how that even works.  You should pick up Daryl Hammond's book.  It's very interesting.  Have you read it?  I read it for the movie.  I'll wait for the first, I don't know, a few pages.  I'll wait for the SNL sketch.  30, 40 pages of it.  It's very good.  You think they can make a comedy sketch, a skit out of it?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I would think so. 
[00:15:30]  Where he's a cutter.  Or he's just drunk everywhere.  Yeah.  Drunk everywhere.  Is he, uh, is he clean and sober now?  I believe he is now, yeah.  For how long?  I hope so.  I don't know.  It'd be interesting to ask him that.  I don't know.  Because I believe there are stories in that book that say he was using crack in 2010.  Yeah.  That's a mere two years ago at most.  He, uh, did he?  There's one story he's, uh, told, I found myself invested in some of the people in his book,  like, because he told some rehab stories. 
[00:16:00]  Oh.  And there was one really hot, like, 18-year-old in the rehab.  Well, what was his name?  Um, it was Lance.  Oh, yes.  Yes, he was on a helicopter in Vietnam when a flare got shot in.  No, it was, uh, right to Apocalypse Now.  Of course.  It was, um, some 18-year-old, and he said that she was really promiscuous.  And she was, uh, she would always say, let's go out and party.  And she would take guys out for methadone.  And, uh, why is that so fucking hot?  Like, I don't know what it is about, uh, rehab girls, girls, uh, that are institutionalized, 
[00:16:30]  uh, that just seem so available.  And then she said, he was in a group one time, he said she walked in, I guess she just wanted,  and she's like, look, I'll eat any pussy, I'll suck any cock.  Whoa.  And then she, and she's like, I'll even fuck that fat fuck.  And she pointed at some, like, fat, like, religious preacher or something who was there.  And I'm like, I've been obsessed with fuck, this girl turned me on.  Wow.  And I know it's very sick, and she's a damaged, damaged girl.  But I found myself very intrigued by some of the people he would talk about in his rehab stints. 
[00:17:00]  Wow.  That is something, like, like, I don't know why, and, and when you do take the humanity out of it,  it does seem pretty easy to, to get laid with those girls.  You know, you just kind of coax them with a little bit of the drugs that they're in rehab for.  Uh, it's a terrible thing to say.  It really is a horrible look at it.  But it's that sex thing that just kind of wields its ugly, uh, ugly face and dick.  I find myself only enjoying sex if it feels like a drug. 
[00:17:30]  Then I like it.  Like, if it feels like a drug, if it feels like I'm using a drug, then I love it.  Really?  Yeah.  Now, how does, how does sex turn into that?  I mean, it feels good.  Like, like, the, you know, the payoff and, and the whole thing leading up to the payoff feels pretty good.  Is that drug-like?  No.  Oh, man.  No.  Like, you're not supposed to do it?  Something has to be drug-like about it.  Yeah.  Something has to feel like.  You gotta go cop some pussy?  Yeah.  Is that it?  Yeah.  Seedy.  See a dealer?  Some guy has to show it to me and I have to grab the pussy and drive away really quick. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  It has to feel seedy.  Oh, wow.  Or hurtful.  You can't just have loving, you can't make love.  Make love.  Didn't that happen in Carnal Knowledge?  Wasn't that the problem with, um...  Nicholson?  Yeah, with Nicholson's character.  He just could not have normal sex anymore.  Don't remember.  I haven't seen it.  Who else was in that?  I think it is.  Art Garfunkel.  Jesus.  Very odd casting of that movie.  But I, I think I remember that, that Nicholson reached a point where he just couldn't have regular sex. 
[00:18:30]  He was having so much sex during the movie with people and, uh, he couldn't have normal sex anymore.  It had to be some kind of, even a girl that he did care about, she had to portray this hooker and filthy whore for him to even have it mean anything.  Yeah, otherwise my dick just lays out like a knotted piece of rope.  Bored out of its mind.  I can actually see Z's coming off it.  I don't know.  I, uh, I still love just fucking, you know, your normal kind of sexual intercourse thing. 
[00:19:00]  I like that.  I, I, I hate how I'm portrayed, I guess, people, because I get a lot of, uh, Twitter links that I click on that people think are going to be, um, very exciting to me.  One thing that I do not find sexy at all, and people assume I find very sexy, chicks with guns.  I don't find it fucking sexy.  Hmm.  Enough with the chicks with guns.  Eh, you're going to love this one.  And there's some stripper looking bitch holding an AK-47.  She's all greased up and shit. 
[00:19:30]  I don't, I, not, not sexy.  I don't like my guns and sex together.  Sorry.  Doesn't work for me.  Uh, like guns?  Like sex?  Like guns?  Like naked chicks?  Naked chicks and guns together?  Probably not.  But, yeah, I mean, you know, she's fine.  Uh, she's a little, you know, little very average looking, white trashy girl.  But she's holding a gun.  She doesn't have to be holding the gun.  I don't look at her and go, oh, she said, oh, and with the gun, ooh. 
[00:20:00]  You don't like the lengths people send you?  No, people are dumb.  I've seen the door handles for the house that look like guns.  I wouldn't put them in my house.  No.  I like guns.  I don't like gun things.  Gun fucking tchotchkes.  You don't need every element of your life to be a reminder that you enjoy firearms.  If the doorknobs on every door in my house were little gun grips that you twist.  Yeah.  And pull the trigger to open the door.  I mean, they have these and people tweeting me these. 
[00:20:30]  Hey, you gotta check this out.  No, I don't.  You should put it on your front door just to, just in case you were wondering.  Let the neighbors know.  Yeah.  I shoot people.  Stay away.  Yeah, I don't know.  People send me the dumbest shit and think I want to see it.  Then they send me shit I saw fucking weeks or months ago.  You see this?  See it?  We talked about it on the air.  We played it.  I don't expect people to know everything, but you gotta assume that I've probably seen it. 
[00:21:00]  I like this concept that the listeners think that they know you and what you like based on how familiar they've gotten with you.  And they send you things and you hate them.  Yes.  Well, all right.  You put it that way, Sam.  Smartass.  Just like, oh, he's gonna love this.  Then you get on the air and you're just like, stop sending me shit.  Yeah, he's gonna love it.  Did you see those Back to the Future shoes?  Wow.  Dude, I didn't see those.  I know.  God.  I do like some of the stuff that I get sent.  Some of the links I get sent when it, you know, sometimes reinforces some ideologies I do have. 
[00:21:30]  I saw a story yesterday that was very interesting about some more sneakers.  I guess there was a problem in a mall.  The Foam Nikes?  Yeah, the Foam Nikes came out.  They had over 100 people and maybe 80 or so pair of sneakers in the store.  And they didn't figure that that would be a problem since it's been a problem every time they do this.  And wow.  They look pretty cool, actually. 
[00:22:00]  But that made them very comfy.  Do they?  They're probably very comfortable, yeah.  I've never looked at sneakers that black people have fought over at stores and thought I ever wanted them.  No.  Well.  Sorry.  I can't even shop at regular sneaker places anymore because all of the designs are so loud and tacky.  They look so wacky.  I'm not buying no fucking shiny purple shoes with springs on it.  Get the fuck out of my face.  It looks like car upholstery.  It's button tucked and it looks like a booth in an old restaurant. 
[00:22:30]  You don't like the wood trim?  There's a wood trim around there.  Like an old station.  Grand Cherokee from the 70s.  Oh, shit.  These are actually Air Jordans I don't think I ever owned.  Not to make it about me again, but the ankle.  I can't have high top shoes because they make my ankles hurt.  Oh, do they?  I thought they would give you more support, Jimmy.  I would think so, too, but they're not.  That is the irony of it.  You were never able to wear chucks?  No.  High top chucks?  Yeah.  I don't love it.  But these look comfy. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  My mommy wouldn't let me wear the high top chucks, man.  Wow.  I resented that for many years.  Because she, and to quote my mother, she said, that's what the niggers wear.  I'm just being honest.  She said it to you?  That's what my mother said.  It really is talking to home.  It really is.  It was a learned thing.  But she did say that.  That word was thrown around the Kumeya household like the word the, was, you bitch, and you cheating 
[00:23:30]  motherfucker.  You know, things like that.  Oh, so there was a lot of awful things said in the house.  Oh, terrible things, Jimmy.  Terrible things.  But that was one.  She didn't want me wearing the high tops.  You know, she didn't want me looking like one of those people.  You and Daryl, by the way, will have something growing up in a violent or scary household.  Scary house.  It's worse.  Yeah.  But yeah, you grew up kind of scared.  There was some scary things going on. 
[00:24:00]  Again, the word came up whenever, see, it was supposed to be a happy time, things like  my birthday, let's say.  My birthday is supposed to be a very happy time.  How old?  Any time between I remember and, you know, my teen years.  So little Anthony was turning eight years old.  Little Anthony, perfect example.  I'm turning eight years old.  I get a little card in the mail, and let's say it's from my Aunt Dee Dee.  Aunt Dee Dee and Uncle Roy sent me, Uncle Roy Roy sent me a card. 
[00:24:30]  And I open it up, and I see a picture of Hamilton on there.  That's a $10 bill, my friend.  And for me as a kid like that, wow, huge.  You could buy a lot of ice cream bars with that.  Oh, man.  You could buy a lot of everything.  And you know what?  I wanted to go out and start spending.  Sure.  You're a kid.  But, you know, I was informed, and I'm happy.  It's my birthday.  I want to spend.  I was informed that by going out and spending it, I was acting nigger rich. 
[00:25:00]  Jesus.  That is another word I heard a lot of because I wouldn't, what, invest it?  I'm eight years old.  What am I, buying fucking IBM stock?  I want to buy candy.  I want to buy those little wax bottles with the Coca-Cola tasting stuff in it.  I want to buy dots.  I want to buy Necco wafers.  And that licorice that was rolled up in the spools.  I want to buy candy cigarettes.  And I was told through a racial epithet that by spending that money, I was going to, you know, I was going to be a terrible person. 
[00:25:30]  So do you think that maybe some of that racial, those bad racial messages you received perhaps skewer your view?  Oh, no, I'm just glad I heard them so it could set me up for what life was really about.  It was, yes, I do think it did have some effect on me, Jimmy.  You cannot look at an upbringing like that in such a racist home and not have it affect me in some way, shape, or form. 
[00:26:00]  That maybe I did have certain prejudice.  But now you're at the point where you realize you believe they were correct.  Well, no, I don't think right from the outset I should just be angry at certain people of certain racial backgrounds just based on nothing.  Just based on my parents throwing horrible epithets around.  Gays didn't fare much better in the house either. 
[00:26:30]  No, they didn't like the gays.  Because the second I did anything that resembled any type of stereotypical feminine behavior.  Like what?  Oh, crying.  Sure.  Because you were upset about the racial epithets.  Crying, yeah, maybe that's it.  You know, maybe World War III between my parents got me a little pissy-eyed, as my father would say.  What are you, pissy-eyed?  You getting all pissy-eyed, faggot?  Would you really say that?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Stop being a faggot.  Stop being a faggot. 
[00:27:00]  I should have taught him and sucked a few dicks.  That's right.  I would have showed him.  You should have taught him.  You should have just told him what you had.  Dad.  He just wanted to go and actually do it.  Yeah.  At dinner, you should have taken a fucking glass and a spoon and went ding, ding, ding, ding.  Ding, ding, ding, ding.  Hello.  Hello.  Yeah, but he called me, yeah, told me I was getting pissy-eyed.  Knock off with the pissy eyes.  Pissy eyes?  It's called tears.  I'm crying.  I feel sad. 
[00:27:30]  He wasn't an emotional guy?  Nah.  Nah.  Nah.  Not really an emotional guy as far as that's concerned.  Very emotional when he fought with mom, though.  Did he cry?  No, no.  I mean, with anger.  He's passionate.  Yeah.  Him and mom would really go at it.  Wow.  Would they curse at each other?  Boy, I see parents these days, you know, if I say fuck or something like that and there's  kids in the room, I kind of get the look like, and I go, oh, sorry, sorry, and they're very 
[00:28:00]  conscious of what the kids are hearing and saying.  My parents, fucking five, six, seven years old, I'm hearing, you motherfucking cock-sucking  fuckface.  I remember mom calling my dad a fuckface, and I was just like, it doesn't really make sense,  but it was kind of, you know, it was pretty powerful.  Yeah.  I don't want fuckface.  And then a lot of bitch, my mom was, you know, called a bitch a lot of times, and then  dad would storm out and shut the door, and this relief would come over me like, oh, thank 
[00:28:30]  God, the argument's over.  Oh, God.  Did you ever use those words, like, when you went to school, or were you scared of them?  No, I was petrified of those words.  I would never use them.  Yeah, back then, you know, yeah, you never used those words in school, especially with  a teacher and stuff.  Now, teachers are just called cunts and shit like that, and they don't even have to leave  the classroom.  They're like, all right, settle down.  No, I didn't do the reading.  Fuckface.  Oh, fuckface.  All right, you.  Well, dude, sit down.  Sit down.  What?  The principal would literally walk in the classroom if the teacher called on that hotline next 
[00:29:00]  to the door and said that she was called a cunt, and you would get your face beaten.  The fucking principal would show up at the gym teacher to work you over.  You didn't get away with that shit.  No.  But many of the children were actually learning it at home, so, you know.  There was a balance, because back then, kids were probably a little bit better behaved  in certain areas, because they were afraid of getting the shit beat out of them.  Yeah.  But then they turned into fucked-up adults. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  I think this generation will turn into fucked-up adults, too, though.  Yeah, I think you're right.  I think when you look at the mentality of child-rearing that brought up the Occupy people, I think there's  a problem there, not the same type of problems that we had, let me tell you.  I think we got a lot of psychotic fucking crazy people because of the way we were raised.  But I think you're going to get a lot of, as my father said, pissy-eyed faggots we're 
[00:30:00]  going to get from the way kids are raised today.  But you had them in the 60s, too.  They're the same as the Occupy.  I think part of it's healthy.  You go through this rebellion, and then what happens?  What do you do with it?  Do you kind of mellow out?  I think it's healthy to rebel a little bit, even if it's a corny rebellion.  Yeah, that's true.  It kind of makes you come into your own, I guess.  If you didn't question anything or rebel anything, you're not really getting an identity of your 
[00:30:30]  own.  So, yeah, it's healthy to a point.  I hate when people do it just because everyone else is doing it, and you're rebelling because  you think that's what you're supposed to do.  You really don't feel any passion toward what you're doing.  But, yeah, I don't know.  I think everybody just had a fucked up upbringing.  I don't think one person really has what you would consider normal upbringing, because  I think that's just a fallacy.  I don't think that exists.  Normal upbringing. 
[00:31:00]  No.  I just heard a lot of fun stuff growing up.  Ants, uncles.  Even something as innocent as just a Brazil nut.  You know, everyone knows what Brazil nuts were called.  Nigger toes.  My grandma.  And it wouldn't even be like a joke.  There wouldn't be any irony to it.  There wouldn't be.  It wasn't even that she was, like, projecting any hatred.  It just became so natural to call them that.  That's what it was called.  There was an episode on the Louie show where an old lady was going to crack the road and 
[00:31:30]  called him that.  Yeah, yeah.  And that's...  Jesus Christ.  Danny pulled up a couple of pictures of some Brazil nuts.  It's just nuts.  They're just nuts.  That's it.  I see the comparison.  But, boy, you know, you don't realize...  And sometimes Jimmy brings this up, as a matter of fact, that we did have some pretty heavy-duty  racist, and it wasn't all that long ago.  Racism.  And that's kind of a point. 
[00:32:00]  Like, you wouldn't...  You really wouldn't hear of that these days.  No, it would be shocking to hear it.  But then it was very accepted and just kind of used in certain family circles, especially  the Italians.  Notorious.  And you'll still hear it, but not nearly as much as you would.  No, no.  I think those people that really accept that are dying off, you know?  Yeah.  When they think that it should be...  You know, it doesn't mean it to be a whiny, piecey fruit, but...  Yeah, yeah.  There was something to be said for not being a fucking screaming racist. 
[00:32:30]  Exactly.  But then, on the other hand, I do look at certain things like this sneaker riot and think, what  the fuck are you doing?  You know?  What the fuck?  People pulled knives out.  They had to lock down the mall because some people...  And it was a predominantly black crowd in Baltimore, I guess, somewhere near Baltimore, over sneakers.  Now, you know, let's be real here.  There's just a certain segment of society that really goes bullshit over things like this 
[00:33:00]  and takes it to the point of stabbing people.  And that's got to be dealt with as much as, you know, calling fucking Brazil nuts nigger toes  has to be dealt with.  Well, there's a thing in, like, you'll see, like, a lot of...  It's like a drug dealer thing, too, where a lot of times in black neighborhoods, cars...  Like, you'll see someone who lives in a shitty apartment has an amazing car.  Yeah.  Or, you know, these weird external things are considered these great status...  I guess everyone likes status symbols, but it's almost irrational a lot of times in black culture 
[00:33:30]  the way certain status symbols are taken over common sense.  It's like, it's a pair of sneakers.  What are you pulling a knife at?  There's no rational thinking behind some of it.  It's just, I don't know why it's so important to have what that represents.  I think there is this lack of self and community respect  that it just becomes this very materialistic thing.  I watch so many videos where it's just, let's say, there's a party going on, 
[00:34:00]  there's some hip-hop blasting, and you will see people with the, you know,  their pants down around their ass holding up money.  Like, everybody's fanning out some cash and waving it into the camera with one hand  and throwing up a gang sign with the other.  It's like, really?  Like, what is that supposed to make people think?  Like, wow, he's a player?  This guy with 17 bucks?  They won't put the thing to say $17.  I love that. 
[00:34:30]  He's holding up a gang sign with his right hand and his left hand.  He's got $17, and he's trying to be all whored.  I'm whored!  And it says, now that's gangster.  Yeah.  Yeah.  See, I don't see that being real gaudy, you know?  I'm not feeling it, yo.  But, yeah, there is just this thing with the material possessions like that.  I guess, you know, if you're denied them for years, maybe that's it.  I'm pretty done with trying to figure out the whys. 
[00:35:00]  I'm really at the old crotchety just knock it off point in my career here.  All right, stop it.  I don't need answers.  There's a point to that, too.  I mean, Bill Cosby, you can say, feels like that, you know, and Bill Cosby gets called  out a lot.  I think black people love Bill Cosby, and they know that he's pretty much right, you know,  but he's just, he says, like, he sees it, and that annoys a lot of people.  A lot of, black people still have this thing where you're judged against white people. 
[00:35:30]  Like, if you do something that's, like, you know, in whites, there's conservatives, there's  liberals, whatever it is, but if you do something too conservative and you're black, you're  a sellout, they tie everything into a relationship with white people.  Yeah, how it relates to a lot of things.  The ruling class, as you would call white people.  I don't know exactly what that is.  I don't know either.  I don't know how it's ever going to be dealt with either.  I mean, we've discussed it many times.  It changes.  Yeah.  I think so, yeah. 
[00:36:00]  It's just generations.  We don't see it because we're here.  Yeah.  But when you look back and you say, like, when you were growing up, they would call it  those nuts nigger toes.  Like, that's unacceptable today.  Yeah, that's unacceptable today.  But you didn't see the change happening.  Like, one day you didn't wake up and go, oh, I shouldn't say that anymore.  It's kind of shitty.  Yeah.  You just look back and go, oh, fuck.  Look at how much things have changed.  But there's just, God, there's something going on with young black men that I just can't  understand.  It doesn't seem like it's very, that white people can assimilate to that very easily. 
[00:36:30]  It doesn't seem like they can assimilate to what we would call just society very easily.  When I see that, the holding up the money, the fucking, the chicks just bent over, shaking  their ass with fucking guys behind them, literally butt-fucking them on the dance floor.  It's like, that just seems odd to me.  But those are, but they really, they're not that different.  I mean.  Yeah.  No, because look what happens when you see big rappers. 
[00:37:00]  Like, 50 Cent was a drug dealer who was shot in the face.  Yeah.  And he, you know, and there's a picture of the paper today, like Jay-Z and Liza Minnelli  backstage.  Like, when those guys who are hardcore rappers, look at Snoop.  He's a gangbanger.  But it seems to come with cash, though.  It doesn't seem to come with just this experience.  It seems that you need money to bring some of these people into the fold.  You know what I mean?  To realize, oh, there is a different way of life out there.  Like, that to me, this to me is one of the most frightening scenes I've ever seen in 
[00:37:30]  my life.  It's just a video Danny pulled up of, obviously, a party.  All black people at a party.  They're just flipping the bird and gang signs to the camera.  That would scare a lot of black people.  Depends on what side of the fence.  Yeah.  I mean, you don't want to be in a gang fucking, a gang dance.  Look at these chicks are just, like, bending over, laying on the floor, getting fucked.  What is that? 
[00:38:00]  Stop doing that.  Our ass is moving.  But I just, but when I grew up, my friends were very split.  And I spent a lot of my life in black households.  With your cango head.  Yeah, but before that childish phase.  Yeah.  And it was the same.  I mean, there was just no difference.  Yeah.  It really wasn't.  It wasn't this foreign, weird world.  I don't know.  At all.  All right.  James.  James is on line four, I guess.  Can we chat with James from Cleveland? 
[00:38:30]  James.  Hey, what's going on, Ann?  Hi, sir.  I've been listening to the show for a really long time, and I know you touch on this every  once in a while, but have you really, like, ever really hung out with any, like, black  people or try to, like, relate to them on any level?  Yeah, the only one.  He just died recently.  That's about it.  No, no.  Actually, actually, I have, but it's like a one-on-one thing where it's very my neck of 
[00:39:00]  the woods, like, like, it's black people that have come into my white fold instead of the  other way around.  But now, if it's the other way around, and let's say I went to a party like we're watching  on the computer right here, or I went to a cookout where it was predominantly black  people, I would probably feel uncomfortable.  I would probably feel like I absolutely didn't fit in.  I would feel like that.  Why?  I don't know. 
[00:39:30]  Why would you, like, okay, I'm a black guy.  I drag race.  I've talked to you about this before.  I drag race.  I do a lot of what, quote, unquote, is white culture things.  And I don't feel that uncomfortability around or like that, but yet I'm able to go.  My roommate, he's a white guy.  He's an engineer.  Just one step away from a doctorate.  So you're a weird exception.  But we go to, we'll still go to all these cabarets and parties, and he doesn't feel 
[00:40:00]  out of place either.  And he doesn't, there's no problems that pop off, and it's some of the same, like, stereotypical  parties that you bring up.  But I don't see you bringing up, like, there's multiple folds of black people instead of just  this gang sign, what's going on, yo, shit.  Well, those are the parties I tend to see online.  So, I mean, I'm not seeing just a regular how-do-you-do party, because I guess those  don't make it onto the internet, because no one really cares.  Hi, Bobby Kelly.  Bobby's here.  Hey.  Bobby. 
[00:40:30]  And don't you, we're talking about Anthony and just race and stuff.  Yeah.  But black guys, you're like, you love guns.  You know more about guns than any fucking...  Well, legal guns.  It doesn't matter.  You still love, you love talking about guns.  Yeah.  You love what guns represent.  You love fucking, look at a young pussy.  Like, what?  You're not different.  You like dancing?  You like, the dancing he splits on.  But you have a tremendous amount in common with young hip-hop.  Hip-hop guys would probably like talking to you a lot more than me.  Well...  And I enjoy their music more than you do, but they would probably enjoy talking to you a 
[00:41:00]  lot more than they would enjoy talking to you.  See, but I wouldn't, I wouldn't appreciate talking to somebody who, you know, doesn't respect  having legal guns.  I also, you know, believe it or not, somebody that just really treats women horrifically,  I don't know, that I couldn't get along with.  It just seems to me that it's so, it's such a different culture that I could not possibly  fit in.  I'm not saying, you know, that I'm the one that's so high and mighty and right here. 
[00:41:30]  I just, it's my own fault.  I don't think I could fit into certain cultures and I think predominantly black parties and  outings and stuff.  I wouldn't be able to fit in.  Do you think that Anthony needs to spend more time around black people?  Of course, I do think Anthony needs to spend more time around black people, but the thing  is, he likes to spend, every time he talks about it, he likes to talk about the extreme.  That's like me trying to say, like, every last thing, a Republican, some racist white  guy.  Well, that's what they're portrayed as. 
[00:42:00]  Well, they're portrayed that way.  But it's not.  I know, I know that for a fact that, that's a lie.  You're an anomaly.  No, the black people you're scared of are the black people that most other black people  are scared of.  Yeah?  Yeah, young gangsters are scary to anybody.  Yeah?  Yeah, nobody.  It's not good.  I don't want to be around negative.  Fuck that.  It's too much good shit.  A 15-year-old gangster with a gun is a frightening prospect to anybody.  Anybody who's kind of law-abiding doesn't like a 15-year-old with a fucking gang signs 
[00:42:30]  and it's frightening.  So what type of get-togethers are we talking about that I would fit into?  What type of African-American get-togethers?  I guarantee you, the same way that you barbecue in your backyard and stuff.  It's white trash, though.  It's karaoke.  Yeah.  I can't see this.  It's like, yeah, fire up the karaoke machine, motherfucker.  Go sing some Pearl Jams and shit.  Get some gray white on that motherfucker.  Fire that shit up. 
[00:43:00]  It's like this.  I'm in the car club.  I'm in this car club called Crown Vic.  You're so white.  Yeah.  Do guys in your car come call you the cruiser?  Yes, he's trying to call me the cruiser.  It's mostly black guys with Crown Vic with big grams on and everything.  They used to be in the backseat of the Crown Vicks, though.  All right, well, the thing, I just wanted to see what you said, you know, have I ever tried to relate? 
[00:43:30]  Thank you, James.  Appreciate it.  I just don't think you're racist.  I just think you're just a little bit just...  I'm a little ignorant, right?  A little bigoted.  I'm ignat.  Yeah.  I really would like to see you hang out with more black people.  Oh.  I think, yeah, I think you are new, too.  Yeah.  It's fun.  You are welcome in the community.  Ooh.  Do you know what I found?  When I go in, like, when I did that...  I mean, again, it's a little different with TV cameras.  Thank you, sir.  But when I was doing the piece for Leno on the Saints opening day, and we were down in 
[00:44:00]  New Orleans under a bridge, and you're talking to these different groups that are partying  and tailgating, and when you go to the black area, you are the only white people there.  Yeah.  And, you know, these are hardcore guys from New Orleans, and fucking everybody came up  and was nice and fun and friendly, and Jay Leno, like every other group we talked to,  there was no uncomfortability, it didn't feel weird, and I know it's different when you're  doing a TV taping, but if you looked on the outside at that group, you would have felt  nervous going there, but then you get there, and they're the same asses at a barbecue that 
[00:44:30]  I just talked to that were fucking white, just happy to be waving to Jay Leno.  There was no difference.  But then I see, like, when we went to New Orleans, and those black guys were just punching  white people walking down the sidewalk, it was like, that infuriated me.  Sure, me too.  It was, like, infuriating, because it was totally based on race.  Yeah.  And they were just being so fucking nasty.  I don't know.  Anytime you see people like you being the victim of fucking just pointless racism, it 
[00:45:00]  stinks, and it's enraging, and it's emasculating.  Like, how many times have you seen, like, you watch 60s videos of fucking blacks just being  treated horribly, and you're like, how the fuck did that happen in this country?  Yeah.  Like, New Orleans stuck with me and you fucking one instance years ago.  Can you imagine seeing fucking newsreels from the last 50 years being booted out of diners  and fucking firehosed for wanting to go to college?  It's like, there has to be some kind of a balance with it.  If I went down to New Orleans now and saw a total change and didn't see, you know, black 
[00:45:30]  people hitting white people like that and everything had changed, I would lighten up.  That doesn't seem to have happened no matter how nice things get and how much more fair  things get and how much we don't take fire hoses and German shepherds out anymore, you  know?  You gotta be careful.  You gotta be careful where you go.  Careful.  But I have a habit of the German shepherd.  I don't know, man.  George Foreman ruined that one.  It just became a...  When he brought it overseas, people were like, oh, George.  It just became a breathe it. 
[00:46:00]  Like, yeah, it isn't...  It was the dog.  It was the shit, man.  Growing up, that was the fucking dog.  That was the one.  You never see a German shepherd.  One named Fritz.  Poor German.  And he always had the secret word that he would attack people with.  Because they shed, I think.  The people get hair all over and the noise are going...  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was at a party last night, speaking of...  How was that?  I went for a little while in love.  It was fucking awesome.  Great party.  Were you blowing some guy in a pig mask?  Yes.  It wound up being great.  Dumb Keith wound up getting drunk and demanding music. 
[00:46:30]  So Gnome had to get on and start playing hip-hop.  Oh, dude.  It was packed.  It got packed.  And he was playing hip-hop with all the brothers.  And all the black dudes were dancing to, you know, hey, ho, hey.  And then I had them cut off and put your dumb fucking CD on.  I just had to cut the music off and play Jimmy's eating assholes bit.  So it just, hey, everybody's having a fucking blast. 
[00:47:00]  I wish I got the video.  Oh, that's fucking great.  And then it just shuts off.  And it's like, yeah, I fucking eat my asshole.  Fuck it.  And everybody turns to the booze like, what the fuck is this?  You dick.  That's funny.  That is...  It wasn't a welcomed addition to the party.  Oh, dude.  If you could have saw people's faces...  Someone just started booing.  They didn't even know you.  They had a great time.  Yeah, you're going to eat my asshole.  I got to give her credit, though.  She's going to eat my asshole.  It was fucking hilarious. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, man.  That's good.  Hey, you know what we should do?  Make love.  I guess take a break so we could eat and do these fucking multitudes of, well, these  wonderful, wonderful products that we endorse on this very program for Valentine's Day.  Oh, good.  It's that novel right over there.  Is it Valentine's Day?  Coming up.  Coming up.  You're a fantastic reader, by the way.  Oh, I try.  You do really good reads.  I try.  I just try to read very quickly. 
[00:48:00]  And maybe add something that sounds ad-libbed in there.  The sponsors love it.  We'll get through them.  Oh, yes.  We will.  We will.  All right.  Well, we'll be back with Bobby.  I want to get you a little take on the Pats and why you didn't pick up my phone call.  All right.  Daryl Hammond in a bit.  Daryl Hammond coming in at, what, 8?  8 o'clock.  Oh, okay.  Cool.  And, yeah, we're here.  Yay.  Be right back.  Sirius XM. 
[00:48:30]  Sirius.  XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Get in topical.  Hold up.  Wait a minute.  All right.  Yeah, how you doing, sexy?  Yeah, hi.  Let's see.  Dukes of Hazzard finale aired 27 years ago.  Bravo.  You got it.  Good job.  All right.  So.  That was fun.  Yeah.  What's going on?  How you doing?  Bobby.  The last. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, yeah.  I guess we should talk about Bob spoiling everyone's fun.  Yeah, yeah.  Apparently, Bobby was not a fun guy to watch the Super Bowl with.  The first three quarters, he was fine.  His wife was lovely.  Their friend was lovely.  A friend in a wheelchair that when I told, he goes, who's coming over?  I go, a friend of mine.  He's in a wheelchair.  Norton goes, why?  Why?  You kind of do have to know why.  Well, no, it's just, there's something.  I don't know if it's medical or accident related.  Yeah, I mean, we're trying to have fun. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, yeah.  In a wheelchair there.  Taking up space.  Just lazy, maybe.  You know.  No, he's a good guy.  Everybody's bumping into his cheek.  He's going to say, excuse me.  He rolls over your foot.  Yeah.  No, he's a good guy.  Come on.  I'm trying to get to the buffalo bites.  Well, we had everything healthy, too, which was a little annoying.  I wouldn't say it was healthy.  It was low carb.  Yeah, everything was low carb and healthy.  We had little mini pizzas.  Did you have, like, what, celery and stuff?  We had vegetables.  Yeah, also anarchy. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, God.  Don't you hate that fucking, the nudge now?  The chip nudge?  Yeah.  Brings me back to when I was a juvenile delinquent in Boston.  I just, I hit him with a fucking picket.  Oh, no.  You hit me with a protester?  Oh, no.  Oh.  I don't.  I fucking hate it.  It's so skeevy.  I don't know how someone could touch you and be that skeevy with it.  He fucking kind of bends his wrist bone.  Yeah, his wrist bends and he hits you with his forearm. 
[00:50:30]  It's supposed to be an elbow, like, hey, right, right?  But, no, he doesn't know how to do it because he's chip.  Yeah, he's not.  He's not.  You're wrong.  He's not chip.  What?  No.  I got a text yesterday.  He's not chip any longer.  Who is he?  He changed my name legally.  He changed his name.  To what?  He texted me and he said he changed his name.  Pepe Sinclair.  What?  Pepe Sinclair is my new name.  Why?  You're chip.  It's just, it's from the 40s where everybody was a gentleman.  A gentleman? 
[00:51:00]  Pepe Sinclair?  Yeah.  That's what I say.  It's got good ring to it.  So, is this a football party?  He's very up.  I like that, that, you know, you're very up, but you're still very chip.  What's that?  See?  Go ahead.  I fucking hate Pepe and chip.  Yeah.  They were both at my party.  It was good.  He's fine.  My wife loves chip.  She just cracks up.  Anytime stupid chip makes a chipper.  Oh, really?  Don't you hate that one?  I just hear her howling.  And the best part is when I walk in, his fucking dogs, I call the one now Seal Boy, because 
[00:51:30]  it makes seal noises.  Oh, no.  It's agonized fucking seal sounds.  It's the dog, though.  It's the Silky Terrier, the one we had to get another dog because it was so antisocial.  It was just a fucking piece of shit dog.  It wasn't friendly to anybody.  But to Norton, this fucking dog loves.  Loves Jimmy.  I'm not even kidding you, dude.  He likes people, but he gets into some frenzy, high-pitched, flipping out when this shell-less 
[00:52:00]  turtle comes to my house.  And it won't stop.  He gets so excited.  His little dick tail just goes back and forth and then gets too excited and stops and starts  to stutter because it's getting so excited.  It doesn't know how to work anymore.  It's fucking awful.  Why?  He loves it.  I don't know.  I just, animals tend to respond well to me.  They look the same. 
[00:52:30]  Peanut butter somehow.  Yes, and children.  They look the same in the shower.  But they do.  This dog, I love the dog, too, though.  Oh, that's sweet.  Yeah, but it's fucking stupid.  He gets little kisses.  And Jimmy puts his little thin lips together.  The dog goes.  And he kisses my chin and my neck.  He's very cute.  He tries.  He just stands up on me because he has like a little Chewbacca face.  He looks just like Chewbacca.  Yeah.  But with short hair.  And he puts his little arms up on my chest and he'll just attack my face with kisses as 
[00:53:00]  everyone wants to.  He gets jealous if the other dog comes over.  Jimmy goes, oh, who's the other?  Who's getting jealous?  And he tries to get my dog jealous with the other dog.  I'll call the white dog over just to make him jump more.  Oh, really?  And then the dog freaks out that you're paying attention to the other dog?  Yeah, I like to call her over and watch him nudge her out of the way.  It just shows him like there's competition.  So keep them kisses coming, buddy.  Keep them kisses coming, pal.  There's someone waiting in the wings if you decide to stop a kiss. 
[00:53:30]  If the dog kisses stop, there's a lot more dog kisses where these came from.  It was the worst.  First of all, the night before sucked because the UFC with Nick Diaz  was a little disappointing.  Oh, I was reading your tweets on that one and you were none too happy about that either.  But I'm happy now because they just signed last night.  Fucking he's fighting again.  Condit and Diaz just signed fighting two before St. Pierre.  I was wondering if they would do a rematch before St. Pierre.  I'm fucking so happy.  Dana White confirmed it. 
[00:54:00]  Carlos Condit agreed to it yesterday.  They're fighting again, which is fucking because now he can't do it.  He can't just.  I know what he did.  If we tell people who he's Carlos Condit.  Carlos Condit was fighting Nick Diaz for the UFC welterweight championship.  The interim championship.  Interim.  Mm-hmm.  Interim.  While St. Pierre is healing from an ACL.  Yeah.  He's healing.  So, I mean, Carlos Condit went in with one of those game plans.  These guys are both fighters.  This is what was disappointing.  They're both brawlers and they're both like, someone's leaving in a coffin. 
[00:54:30]  Right.  So you're like, oh my God, this is going to be the best fight ever.  Thunderdome.  And then one went in with a game plan.  And I'm not fucking getting knocked out.  I'm not playing his.  I'm not fighting this guy.  I'm going to just get points and get the fuck out of there and get this belt.  Which sucks.  I get it.  It's good for you and your family and your team.  You're the champion.  But it just sucks.  Everyone wanted, a lot of people wanted Diaz to win.  Because Diaz is a dick.  And I'm not saying that in a nasty way.  He's just one of those guys, he's like, he'll drop his arms and taunt.  He's just kind of like an alpha guy.  And he's not an alpha guy, really. 
[00:55:00]  In the ring he is.  He's really not.  In the ring he's a fighter.  But he's really a martial artist and he's a nice, he's really a nice guy.  If you watch any of the interviews, he just hates being interviewed.  He hates cameras.  He has an anxiety problem in front of cameras.  He doesn't like to be in front of crowds or people.  And when he gets there, he gets all fucked up and he doesn't say shit right and he gets pissed off.  Everyone wanted him to win so he could fight George St-Pierre because they genuinely don't like each other.  So that was like, this was like, you know, St-Pierre, that'd be the fucking, unify the belts, Diaz and St-Pierre. 
[00:55:30]  And Carlos Condit had other plans.  Well, I wanted Carlos to win.  I didn't care.  That's why I love the sport.  I don't give a shit which one wins.  I like both of them.  I like Carlos and Nick.  I don't care who fucking won.  Just as long as I wanted it to be a fight.  I wanted them to go in and fight each other.  And sometimes it doesn't happen.  This guy went in and, you know, tap, tap, kick, kick and get the fuck out.  Yeah, that's smart.  Nick was chased.  It's not really.  Yeah, I guess it's smart, but it stinks. 
[00:56:00]  That's why boxing stunk.  But he didn't.  You know, hold on.  He didn't.  Twelve rounds of fucking hugging and tapping.  But he didn't do that.  I got to count.  Now I have to count while I'm watching a fight.  He would counterpunch.  He was counterpunching a lot.  And he was getting out like when they would.  Because Diaz likes to cut you off, get you up against the fucking cage.  And beat the shit out of you.  This guy would get out of the way and fucking threw a lot of kicks.  It wasn't like he was doing nothing and just throwing a jab and hiding.  He was throwing leg kicks and fucking head kicks. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah, but they were both doing it.  It was close to call.  I mean, Carlos, I think, won.  But it was close to call.  It wasn't like he just totally dominated Diaz.  It was close to call.  So I'm just glad they're doing the fight again.  Because now, if he does that running shit again, I hope Nick just stands there and doesn't chase him.  Yeah, because he had to chase him.  If he just stands there and fuck it, I'm not chasing you.  Let's fight.  Because you look like an idiot running away from a guy if he's not chasing you.  If he's just standing there, sure.  When is the fight? 
[00:57:00]  Next week.  Next Tuesday.  No, I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  I would have thought there'd be more of a buildup.  Because St. Pierre won't be able to fight until like November.  Yeah, but it's just going to be great.  I'm so happy.  What do you think they're going to do?  Like maybe June or July?  I don't know.  July 4th weekend maybe?  The rematch?  I don't know.  In Vegas?  It's not when.  It's where.  Because I hope we can go to it.  I hope it's not in fucking Germany or some weird fucking place.  I bet you they do it July 4th weekend.  That's a big fight.  Because you don't want them guys just to sit around for 10 months. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  I can't wait.  It's going to be great.  I love when they did the UFC.  Well, if it's Vegas.  Boxing would never do that.  You're where we're going.  Boxing would never do that.  We are.  That's why I love UFC and Dana White.  Immediate rematch.  Fuck it.  What do the fans want?  You guys in?  Okay, let's do it.  I don't give a shit.  And they're not making a gazillion dollars.  I think Diaz made $200,000 for that fight.  Which is not.  That's it.  Wow.  That's a lot.  Boxers would have to take off fucking two years.  Yeah.  Two years. 
[00:58:00]  Oh, it would fucking blow.  Yeah.  Just fucking assholes.  I want to see this guy's fight again.  What the fuck?  So they're fighting.  But that sucked.  Saturday night sucked.  Okay.  For me.  Because I was like, you know, I spent the 60.  I stayed in.  I didn't do shows by myself.  Oh.  You know, my wife's pissed because she usually gets Saturday nights, so it's her night to  watch, you know, The Voice.  Yeah.  Kind of a rerun she taped.  She likes to watch her have her own shows without this lummox just sitting there cursing  because she knew the next day was going to be an abomination.  Lummox. 
[00:58:30]  Hey, baby.  Everything.  He's just calling her, asking for snacks.  He wants to be waited on hand and foot.  Why are you?  She wants to relax.  Fucking just take her shoes off and watch some TV on a Saturday without his fucking toxic  dog shit energy in the house.  Because they have walkie talkies and I know it's a nightmare for her every time she hears  like the phone because she knows it's going to be a request.  She hates it.  You walkie talkie-er?  I leave one in the bathroom when she's like downstairs.  I'll leave one in the bathroom and I'll just hit the button.  Baby, do we have any milk? 
[00:59:00]  Oh, man.  And she'll be like, just scream, look in the fridge.  And I'll hit the thing.  I can't hear you.  Use the walkie talkie.  It's just downstairs.  She fucking hates me.  I've texted to upstairs, though.  Sure.  I've done that.  Yeah, but your house, it's a fucking compound.  I live in a fucking...  Walk upstairs.  I live in a duplex in Hell's Kitchen.  It's a duplex, though.  Yeah.  It's better than a dump-plex.  Pushing you.  I don't like that at all.  I fucking hate the touch. 
[00:59:30]  It's terrible.  I hate the physical contact from Chip.  It feels so awful.  From Chelsea Sinclair.  What's his name?  Peppy Sinclair.  Fucking Pepsi.  What is his name?  Peppy Sinclair.  Peppy Sinclair.  So then, after you left, dude, the game was just a fucking atrocious.  Now, at the beginning of it, were you all psyched?  Like, Pat, here we go.  No.  He was worried.  No?  You were worried right from the beginning?  Yeah.  Dude, this is a typical Boston fan.  Ready?  The first fucked up play that happens.  Ah, fuck.  It's over.  It's fucking over. 
[01:00:00]  You're right.  It's over.  That's it.  They won the fucking game.  Shut it off.  I could have shut the game off after the first fucking, when the Giants scored.  And you'd have been right.  I would have shut, I could have shut the game off and just went and did something else.  Right.  Honest to God.  I would have fucking done.  Because I grew up in Boston.  We always lose.  The Red Sox, I mean, the only thing I had to grow up.  The Pats have had, you know, some good runs there.  The last 10 years.  Yeah.  But before that, that's, you know, 10 years of my life.  30 years of my life, they've done shit.  So, what, what, do you watch the whole game, though? 
[01:00:30]  I had to watch the whole game.  No, what'd you think, what'd you think of that?  Fuck it, he made me.  That one throw that Manning made where it was caught right on the sideline there.  Did you, did you think, oh, no, that's not in.  No, it was in.  Oh, okay.  Of course I thought it was in.  And here's the deal.  I, I'm, I was so mad, and this fucking asshole made me watch.  Like, he kept doing that guest shit.  Yeah.  Come on, man.  Put it back on.  What are you doing?  Well, I did want to watch the Super Bowl.  I was there to watch, I, I, no, no, I was there to watch the Super Bowl, and he would 
[01:01:00]  just turn it off and, and yell.  Who wants to watch you yell?  That is fucking, that's not a good show.  What a horrible host.  I'm here having, his wife made snacks, his friends over there not moving.  He's just moving.  I want to watch fucking football.  I understood him going downstairs.  I got that.  Yeah.  When he would turn the volume down.  What are you doing?  I hate Chris Collinsworth, too.  I fucking.  He is such a fucking piece of shit. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  He, I felt like he was taunting me.  Like, this guy personally didn't like me.  Everything the Giants did was amazing.  Even the bad shit was, there was some ray of light in it.  And some, some, some, some, oh my God, you know, any, everything the Pats did was, they  were fucking pieces of shit.  Everything they fucking did.  So you're watching the game.  Now the announcer is for the fucking Giants.  The whole fucking crowd is for the Giants. 
[01:02:00]  And you can hear in the distance, because I'm in fucking New York.  So you can hear the local pubs and fucking shit bars with all the shit G-Men.  When everything happens, yeah, you kind of hear it in real time, yeah.  I was so, but I wasn't as bad as last time, but I had to, I had to take Sam after you left.  I had to take my friend, who's in a wheelchair.  I had to take him to the bus stop.  To see his own wheels.  Why would you take him there?  Because, because I have to, oh look, man, there's a, it's, there's a bunch of fucking 
[01:02:30]  drunk people.  It's crazy out.  There's all these bars in my neighborhood.  So I wheel them down two blocks to the bus stop.  And the bus stop happens to be in front of a Giants bar with those big blow up football  guys, Giants.  And it's, and I'm sitting there waiting at a bus stop with my friend in a wheelchair.  And there's a, probably 250 Giants fans surround, just drunk.  Do you have any pass gear on?  No.  I had my, I fucking burn all that fucking culty shit. 
[01:03:00]  I'm sitting there.  I'm miserable.  It's freezing out.  I'm waiting for the bus.  And as soon as we hit the end of my street, he goes, oh, there it is.  And I look and a bus just goes, wow.  I go, is that yours?  He goes, yeah.  I finally flagged the cab over.  And I, I threw him in the cab.  You should have just thrown a grappling hook at the bumper when it passed by.  I took apart his wheelchair.  I took, I took the wheels off.  He's like, it's a little pain in the ass.  Like, I don't give a shit.  Just tell me what to do.  You gotta take the wheels off.  I hocked him in the back, backwards, his legs sticking out. 
[01:03:30]  You had to take the wheels off?  I took the wheels off.  I had to take the back off.  I had to take the, I took it all apart.  Oh, fuck.  I didn't give a fuck.  I'm not standing out there.  That cabbie must have been miserable.  I almost got in a fight with a couple of them because a couple of them were like, go fuck  yourself.  I'm not taking them.  They get in trouble though.  I'm not taking them.  Not from me.  Apparently.  They told me to fuck off.  They told me to go blow myself and my crippled friend.  I was fucking miserable, man.  There's no way to fit the whole wheelchair in the back, huh?  No.  No.  I don't think they fold up. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  They should make it.  What?  They should just make a hook on the back so you can hook it on like a U-Haul trailer.  Yeah.  I think they fold up though, don't they?  Don't they just switch?  No.  Not this.  Some of them do.  Yeah.  The ones from the hospital do, but not this one.  Not this.  You don't have like a real crippled people wheelchair?  No.  This is like a murder ball chair.  Oh, shit.  One of those.  Right.  Yeah.  Made out of fucking like a plain aluminum.  You need those old ones, the wooden ones, like a, what's his face?  Push the old bag down the stairs.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:04:30]  Richard Widmark.  Richard Widmark.  You old bag.  You lying old hag.  Yeah.  You lying old hag.  And you know when he rips the cord out of the wall that's not going to be good?  Yeah.  He ties her into a wheelchair with a fucking...  He's not splicing it to the TV so she could watch from another room.  Can you, uh...  Danny, is there a way to find that online?  Just real quick to fucking...  I wanted the audio.  We played the audio of that?  Oh, it's fantastic.  Yeah.  From Kiss of Death.  Yeah.  Did you see that, Bobby?  I did, yeah.  Fucking old school gangster movie.  She's in a wheelchair and he wants to push it out.  He's looking for her son, Pieter. 
[01:05:00]  Pieter.  Pieter.  That's Peter.  But she says Pieter.  He's giving you a little lesson.  I just wanted to...  I just wanted to hear you say it again.  I got it.  Pieter.  It's a death clip.  Meh.  Meh.  On the YouTube.  There we go.  It's kind of long.  I think I got to...  Yeah.  It's sitting there.  Richard Woodmark's going to the house to find out where Pieter is.  Yeah.  Oh, there's the old broad in the fucking wheelchair.  He's here.  All right.  Go volume.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's walking in.  Your friend Pieter? 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  He's not happy.  Where's his squirt?  Just put a cigarette out on her living room floor.  Up from floor.  After dinner sometime.  Maybe.  Where'd he go to?  Pieter?  How I know where Pieter goes.  Up town.  Town.  Town.  There's a baller game.  Anywhere.  Oh, see.  He's looking at her.  He's none too pleased. 
[01:06:00]  He does not like her.  Looking around for something.  And then he goes in the other room.  And he sees like a bunch of open drawers.  Yeah.  Pieter.  Which shows you that Pieter skipped town.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, is he angry?  He plays a great fucking thug.  Great sociopath.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And here he comes to confront her.  With her lie.  Shut up.  Laughs like you.  I have to dinner sometime.  Oh. 
[01:06:30]  Double crossing squealers bought you.  What's the matter?  I don't know nothing.  So the yellow squirt beat it, huh?  Took a powder, huh?  Took a powder.  He's wiping his mouth.  He can't decide what to do with her.  Where is he?  Where'd he go?  One last chance.  I'm asking you, where's that squealing son of yours?  Huh.  You think a squealer can get away from me? 
[01:07:00]  Huh?  That laugh is a problem.  You know what I do to squeal it?  I let him have it in the belly so they can roll around for a long time thinking it's over.  He's looking at the cord now.  Uh-oh.  Yeah, yeah.  Uh-oh.  He's just looking around.  What can I fuck her up with?  That's a lamp cord.  And he smiles at her like, ah, I thought of something.  You're going to like this.  You're worse than him. 
[01:07:30]  Tell him he's coming back.  You lying old hag.  He's tying her to her.  Why tie her to the chair?  I don't know.  It's not like she's going anywhere.  On a train, huh?  A train.  Wheeling her through the door.  He just shoves her down the stairs. 
[01:08:00]  Holy shit.  It's such a great scene.  It's one of my favorite scenes ever.  I don't know how you can laugh at that and you get mad at me because I tell my wife to  get me a fucking Diet Coke.  You're such a mean guy.  God, that's hilarious.  If I pushed her down the stairs, you'd be like, that's funny.  You lying old hag. 
[01:08:30]  But it's the laugh.  It's the fact that he's playing such a great psychopath.  And he didn't give a second of thought to pushing her down those stairs.  No, he couldn't wait to do it.  He's just like, ah, yeah.  Not at the top of the stairs waiting like, all right, one more time.  Where is it?  Nah.  He was still talking shit.  He couldn't wait to get her to those steps.  He was taunting her as he opened the door.  Like, you know what I do in a squeal?  As he's opening the door.  He was giving her the business all the way down.  The business.  So, I'm sorry.  What were we talking about?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:09:00]  We were talking about the Super Bowl and the fact that.  What about the Hail Mary now?  Do you have any hope at that point?  Dude, I knew we.  Look, man.  I was going to go to a movie.  Do you understand?  I was going to go to a movie before the game.  I wasn't going to watch the game.  What was it?  How many years ago did we lose to the Giants?  It was the 2007 season, but it was 2008.  Four years ago.  I believe it was a very warm out.  Four years ago, I watched that game at my mom's house in Marblehead with around 20 people there. 
[01:09:30]  Marblehead.  I fucking hate him.  I hope Jim dies so Chip dies.  Oh, shit.  Who's that?  I'm kidding.  I take that back.  That's terrible.  Peppy.  Peppy.  I was at my mom's house.  It was fucking terrible.  I left the game.  Same shit.  Same shit.  At the end of the game, I left before it was over.  I'm in my car.  I'm driving.  Nobody on the road. 
[01:10:00]  By myself.  And I knew the game was over because all of a sudden you heard just doors opening.  Lights being turned on because everybody at their parties and their friend's house said,  fuck it.  I'm out.  Bye.  Got in their cars.  All of a sudden, I was in a traffic jam.  It was just lonely, depressed shit dicks in their cars, mad because a team lost and their  life is over.  And I was like, I don't want to fucking do that again.  I'm not doing that again.  Not against the Giants.  Not against the fucking Giants. 
[01:10:30]  Because I already, 2004, the Red Sox, I finally got rid of that horse shit on my shoulder  living here and coming from Boston.  And now, these fucking, that Eli shit face, fucking family, elitist, fucking stupid governmental  made family of fucking quarterbacks that they, I fucking hate that family.  That's the only, that's the only thing that makes me happy is that fucking shit family.  His brother, the ugly one that wasn't supposed to be the star, won a fucking Super Bowl in 
[01:11:00]  the house that you built, stupid, and you aren't going to get to win one.  Ah, ha, ha, ha, you shit family.  The one, the one that never made it.  That'll do it.  That's why I love life.  I love life that he wasn't supposed to be the star star.  Fucking Peyton was the man.  Right.  Breaking all the records.  You got one Super Bowl, dum-dum, and your brother's a fucking, he's about to be an elite,  an elite fucking quarterback.  That's the only thing that made me happy.  His mush face is better than his other mush face brother. 
[01:11:30]  Those fucking pug face douchebags.  I hate them with their little flat noses.  Dumb fucking dad and mom.  We were going to fucking, oh, they fucking suck.  So...  Tell us how you really feel.  Oh, Jim.  Oh, Jim.  Hey, you fucking nudged me again.  So, uh, you, uh, you didn't think the Hail Mary was going down, so then, then...  No.  I thought it was intercepted, actually.  I was lying in my bed patting my white dog, who was a beautiful dog, because she doesn't  like Jim as much, I love that dog. 
[01:12:00]  She doesn't love me, though.  She loves you, but she doesn't like you as much as Kelby.  She couldn't.  No.  No one likes me as much as Kelby.  It's an impossibility.  It makes me sick.  So it's over, what do you do?  I had to wheel my friend down the street.  Ugh.  All right, you wheel your friend down the street.  Tell him to pick your legs up.  What?  You stop.  What do you...  How do you think he felt?  Oh, God.  My legs don't work.  I have to be wheeled down the street by this fucking, fucking fat curmudgeon trying not to eat carbs.  Goddamn patriots.  Meanwhile, he just wants to go for a walk. 
[01:12:30]  He just wants to feel cool water on his toes.  He's not a pathologic, dude.  He can feel his feet.  If I'm fucking wheeling him out of the house like Doyle, wheel this buddy out in fucking sling blade.  Yeah, you non-tuning son of a bitch.  Get the fuck out.  Get the fuck out.  So then I wheeled.  I put that dude in the car.  Yeah.  And I'm fucking gone.  And then I go back to the house and I'm lying in bed and I get your stupid... 
[01:13:00]  Your fucking message that made me...  We were having a party.  Oh, God.  It made me sick.  It was the Super Bowl wrap-up party.  And I was doing a compound show and decided that it would be good to call Bob Kelly.  Because, you know, you're a Patriots fan.  And there were giant fans there.  Not that I'm a Giants fan.  And I just wanted to get your take on it because there weren't any Pats fans at my house.  So we called you up and I guess you saved the message. 
[01:13:30]  Could you pop it by the mic?  Let me tell you something.  This message...  It's a bunch of drunks.  This message hurt me and made me...  But then right at the end made me...  It just makes me laugh.  It's just...  What the fuck is that?  Look at that mess.  Ugh.  What?  What is it?  Oh, it's the big blue parade.  Giant Super Bowl champions.  I mean, I don't give a fuck.  I love you, dude.  Stupid Eli.  Fucking dumb face.  Do you ever see his face?  He's just sad, eh?  He makes a mistake and you can hear his older brother yelling at him. 
[01:14:00]  Why are they dancing, Bob?  Don't be stupid.  Eli, don't be dumb.  Mom and dad don't like dumb.  Well, he's got two Super Bowls.  Look at the big parade they're having in Giant Stadium.  Oh, it was huge.  It was huge.  New York and Jersey.  All right, congratulations, New York.  Good for you.  Congratulations.  You got two.  Wow.  They had a big one downtown and then they all went over to the stadium.  Who goes...  But who gets to go to that stadium party?  I guess anybody.  Eli gets to go.  Did you show up?  It was first come, first serve, I think.  Oh, you just sit where you sit?  Yeah.  Get in there. 
[01:14:30]  Fill up the stadium.  Ready?  So now I'm home.  My dumb phone's off and I look and there's a message and I don't recognize the number.  Because it's your good boy phone.  Yeah.  We had called and...  And then I hear this.  I think this is it.  Mother.  What?  You mother good boy phone.  I'm not a...  Uh-oh.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:15:00]  You're not a...  Oh, yeah.  Uh-oh.  You're not picking fun up, dude.  Dude.  Dude.  I can't...  Dude.  Dude.  Dude.  Dude.  Dude.  Dude, dude.  Dude.  All right.  All right, I get it.  Yeah, that was really obnoxious. 
[01:15:30]  I got to apologize there.  We were hitting the old beers, and a few of those people in that room were hitting the whiskey.  Who was the biggest Giants fan there, Ant?  Biggest Giants fan there was, God damn, who the fuck was?  I don't think anyone really gave a shit.  Did you watch it in the theater or upstairs?  I was watching it downstairs by the bar.  By the bar.  There were some people watching in the theater, though.  Yeah.  The other thing that sucks about the theater, man, the theater is only really to watch movies or TV. 
[01:16:00]  You can't watch a football game in your theater because you can't.  It's an atmosphere where you got to be kind of.  Chill.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And by yourself in your own little chair.  Yeah, you're not really getting that.  Oh, you know, it looks great, but yeah, it's weird.  The dynamic isn't like you're sitting around in the bar area or you're upstairs in the living room.  Yeah.  Yeah, it is kind of odd.  You're right.  They have the USC fights in theaters now in 3D, which I don't know what the fuck that means. 
[01:16:30]  I don't know why you'd see a fight in 3D.  Yeah.  You'd see blood come at you.  Fucking.  But they watch the fights in the theater.  I don't understand how you could just sit there and watch a fight and, oh, God.  I would duck and stuff in the fight.  Oh, yeah.  From the 3D.  Ooh.  Is he still losing weight, Big A?  I don't know.  I think he's plateaued.  Plateau?  I think he's plateaued.  Oh, no.  He lost weight, but I don't think he's losing anymore, is he? 
[01:17:00]  Is he still eating or no?  There you go.  Yeah, see, that doesn't look too fun to me.  Yeah, it's like you're in your own seat.  Yeah.  You kind of, there's no real, uh...  It looks like business class lounge.  Yeah.  Yeah, I like that.  That's the way a football game should be.  You'd like to watch a football game like that?  Fuck yeah.  Nice comfy chair going, oh!  Oh, what happened?  Oh, yeah.  The whole time, though, we're watching the thing.  He's fucking tweeting the whole fucking game.  Yeah.  He's got his face in his phone like a 12-year-old girl who's missing out on the hot date. 
[01:17:30]  Just fucking...  Missing out?  No, I was there with King Kong Bundy who was trying to hang himself.  It was very fun.  Yeah, you know.  Yeah.  Why would I want to avoid that pleasant experience?  We were like a bunch of abuse victims just cowering while Dad ran around drunk.  He said it was very uncomfortable when you were getting angry.  I really did, King.  I really...  My dad, number three, he fucking... 
[01:18:00]  He's the same way.  Like, he'll watch...  He'll move to the kitchen, and then if something good happens...  Now I've got to stay in the kitchen.  Oh, like a superstition.  Now I've got to stay in the kitchen.  And if you move from your spot, if something good...  Get the fuck back in the living room.  Wow, okay, that's crazy.  Yeah, it's crazy shit.  Well, it's fucking...  It's Boston fans, man.  We're nuts.  We're fucking nuts.  Our whole year...  That's like...  Growing up, that's what I fucking...  It's my life.  The Red Sox winning something, or the Celtics, or the Bruins, and then it's over. 
[01:18:30]  And then you have to go to another...  It's every sports fan, though.  It's every...  It's always next year.  Oh, God, dude.  It's always next year.  Oh, it's such a shit feeling.  It is a deep-rooted shit feeling.  And why, though?  But why?  When you really think about...  Because when your team loses, you try to rationalize why I'm so pissed and upset at this  when it's just a sports team.  I'll tell you why.  Because every week when your team wins or loses, but every week when your team wins, 
[01:19:00]  you say, oh, the Pats won this weekend, or you get to watch the game and they pull off.  It makes you feel good.  You get something to look forward to.  It makes you feel good for your shit life.  And your shit fucking week.  And all of a sudden, you feel good for a couple hours.  Right.  And you get to, oh, my God, they won.  And it builds and builds and builds to this frenzy.  That's why I love MMA.  Because there's no season.  And there's no one game, one fight beats all. 
[01:19:30]  You don't have to wait until next year.  After Diaz, I can't wait because Rashad's fighting fucking Jones.  That's a great fight.  When are they fighting?  Why?  Because they don't like each other.  I like the fact that he knew I said he wanted to get to his point.  Like, I said when, and then he realized it, but he still had to finish and go, here's what.  When are they fighting?  And by the way, the Condit fight, just getting there, that was the first thing I had to hear about.  Yeah.  It was, you know what, dude?  You know, fucking run.  You know what, dude?  You stand there like a combatant and you fight. 
[01:20:00]  Combatant?  I'm like, Bob.  I don't know if I said combatant.  We're watching Faith Hill is singing.  Yeah, fucking dude.  It was bullshit.  I fucking watched that fight, dude.  I'm like, ah, this is going to be awful.  So he was just a miserable fuck the whole day.  I walked into an abusive situation.  It was going to be a miserable, unhappy, trapped in that apartment with him and his poor wife and his poor friend, the three of us victims.  He wasn't crippled when he walked in.  Yeah, he's just faking it so Bob wouldn't hit his legs. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, I wanted Jimmy to come over, but it was, the drive does suck.  I knew that there'd be traffic going out there on a Sunday.  Yeah, the drive stinks.  Hey, the fuck, you know what, dude?  The driving on Fortnite is the fucking worst.  Terrible.  Getting to your house on any given day can just suck asshole.  That's, you know, that keeps me protected.  Protected from what?  Well, you know, people that might want to, you know, do me harm.  Oh, Daryl Hammond is here. 
[01:21:00]  I'm just getting that in.  We should probably take a break.  We have a couple playing to break.  What?  We have two new production pieces.  What are they?  One is a Chipper Radio spot and one is a new Sick Fucking Puppies song.  Let's do them after.  We'll do them after.  We don't have to do them now.  Yeah, yeah, let's just take a break and we'll be right back.  The O.P. Anthony Channel.  He's so funny.  Series XM.  The O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[01:21:30]  The O.P. and Anthony Program. 
[01:22:00]  Opie out today.  Bob Kelly sitting in.  What happened to Opie?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Did you guys, did you find out?  I mean, is he?  He's all right.  I don't know.  Daryl Hammond.  Hi, sir.  Hi, sir.  How are you?  Hi, Daryl.  That's Bob Kelly. 
[01:22:30]  I know, Mr. Kelly.  Yeah, you must know these two right here, I'm sure.  That's the incomparable Sam Roberts.  I'm Sir Roberts.  And I, of course, Anthony and Opie.  Not here today.  Oh, that's great.  Not here.  Don't get a complex or anything.  It has nothing to do with you.  I already have a complex.  Ah.  That's what I hear.  Are you looking for the volume?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Help him out, Jimmy.  I don't want to reach under.  It's too creepy to reach under his console.  It really is.  I'll do it.  It kind of looks like you're putting your hand in his lap. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah, it's a little gross.  Hey.  Yeah.  I blew through your book, dude, and probably, I had to stop reading to make it last longer.  It was so good.  You weren't edging with his book?  I really, dude.  It was like when you watch porn and you don't want to cum.  That's exactly what it was like.  I was reading this book.  It was so, so fast getting through it that I made myself wait to finish it.  It was fucking great.  Really?  Thank you.  Yeah, well, that's how I wrote it.  I was watching a porno.  I was watching horny backdoor babes.  That's a good one.  I thought I got to write a book. 
[01:23:30]  Well, knowing you for all these years, I mean, I think I was, I remember being in the car with you.  I want to say it was 90, when did you get SNL?  95.  It was me, you, Maureen, Taron.  We were on Central Park West, and you were talking about some audition you had done.  And I thought it was a screen, something for SNL you had just done.  Yeah.  And maybe you had just gotten hired.  And so then just to see all this happening, it's fucking...  Yeah, it was just, I went through a series of auditions.  Yeah, so I wrote this little book.  What made you decide to get so, you know, in-depth with your life there? 
[01:24:00]  I always wanted to write about contracts between perpetrators and victims.  Well.  Like, the agreement, the things that victims agree to while they're being fucked over are tortured in this case.  Interesting.  Wow, yeah.  And, I mean, you know, we can all be taken advantage of, I guess, at certain points.  And when a person's in a powerful position and could hurt you worse than they're hurting you now, 
[01:24:30]  you sort of sum it up and say, all right, I'm going to stand here and take this beating  instead of, you know, having my skin peeled off and tied to a post, you know?  I remember, you start off the book talking about trying to cut your arm off with a knife.  And I was a cutter when I drank, but never since I quit drinking.  Well, you know, the cutting was never, except for the one time, it was never really about dying.  It was about creating a smaller crisis than the one I was in right now that was in my head.  You know, when I started having flashbacks about, you know, some of the stuff that happened to me, 
[01:25:00]  I mean, I used to have to just hug the floor.  What was the first flashback you had?  Like, what were you doing and what caused it?  Well, what caused it was when I saw my daughter and I realized how perfect she was  and I thought to myself, what would you have to do to someone to make them into me?  You know what I mean?  Like, this thing is so absolutely miraculous and perfect.  What would you have to do to this perfect thing? 
[01:25:30]  And that just sort of set the floodgates open.  And I think, you know, the first flashback, I was in my office at SNL and it started coming back to me about, you know,  my fingers and light sockets and so forth.  And then I just, I ran outside and got a pint of Remy and came back and just laid there on the floor and drank the damn thing.  How did you know it was a memory and not like something that you were just thinking?  Like, did it come back as a visceral feeling or were you like, wow? 
[01:26:00]  It's a visceral feeling as if it was occurring all over again.  And it's just, I mean, you know, when you go to these big hospitals and they go, you know, we can't treat you here.  You should be where they take POWs.  I mean, that happened like four times.  So, you know, you start thinking to yourself, hmm, you know, these things feel so real.  They are so real.  I remember them.  But, you know, like the thing about getting the hands slammed in the doors and so forth, I remembered that. 
[01:26:30]  What was that?  I don't know.  People didn't, I don't know.  We didn't mention that.  What happened with that?  Just my mom used to slam my hands in the door sometimes.  And what was, I mean, this just sounds like psychotic behavior, but what was this, what was the reasoning for this?  Was it just they wanted to abuse somebody?  Well, I mean, I didn't, you know, I was, you know, between four and ten years old, so I didn't loot their 401k or, you know, wreck their car or do anything else.  Right.  It was simply because she was a nut.  And, you know, I mean, the real, I think, breakthrough for me was I was in a hospital for three months with this great doctor who studied me 24 hours a day. 
[01:27:00]  And part of that was looking at, you know, she had once been innocent herself, you know.  But when she died, she wouldn't cop to none of them.  I didn't, I didn't, I don't hate her anymore, and that was a breakthrough.  I mean, it was a form of forgiveness to say, I'm just letting you go.  Yeah, okay, you were abused too, blah, blah, blah.  You know, I get tired of it.  Well, you called at one point, and I have a bunch of questions I wrote down. 
[01:27:30]  As I was reading, I was just fucking typing things I wanted to ask you.  But there was one point where you, you know, part of recovery and stuff is you try to confront people, you talk about things.  And what happened?  You called her?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was like a, well, I was at Cornell Hospital last night, and they said that I have the symptoms of someone who grew up in a POW camp,  but all I really did was grow up in your house, and what's that about?  You know, and she said, see, my mother always had this southern accent.  She always was, you know, just so charming and everything like that. 
[01:28:00]  And she goes, she drops her accent.  She goes, don't ever call us ever again.  Wow.  Click.  And I thought, perfect.  Just great.  Great.  Fantastic.  You know.  I was angry for you reading that.  Like, I remember reading that, and I was angry for you.  That's infuriating.  I think the infuriating thing is that she would, you know, she was like this church person.  And, you know, where I came from at that time, at least, if you put on enough of a show,  like, if you fulfilled the moral checklist of the area, if you cut your lawn and paid your taxes 
[01:28:30]  and you went to church enough times and spoke about Jesus enough, you could get away with any damn thing.  Yeah.  You know, I mean, there were people in that church doing, you know, hideous things.  I mean, people that hide in church can commit great crimes because no one will question them.  Because when someone like my mom can go to someone and convince them that their perception  of the Lord and reality is right, that it's going to turn into something good, you know, 
[01:29:00]  you're unimpeachable.  You know, and she was a clever, clever, clever woman.  I mean, awfully bright.  But, I mean, the bizarre thing is she did impressions.  She would, like, come in the house and go, you know, Coach Brown was there just a second ago,  and he came up to me and he said, what in the hell are you doing?  You know, like that.  You have impressions of Bing Crosby, apparently.  Yeah.  Damn, man.  Yeah, so then there was that.  And, you know, the next thing you know, I'm on that SNL. 
[01:29:30]  Well, you said that was how you bonded with her.  That was how you...  Well, that's how I neutralized her.  Oh.  That's how when she got that look in her eyes, like, sometimes her eyes, it'd be like someone  else was living in there, and she'd turn and look at you, and I'd just be, like, going,  Oh, the dee, Sylvester, what are you, a dee, doing with that dee?  And she'd start laughing.  It just charmed her.  It charmed the hell out of her.  You see, the impression, I was amazed to read that they became this survival thing  where it was, it fucking calmed the savage beasts to do an impression, and it would bond, 
[01:30:00]  or, like you said, neutralize her.  It charmed her on some strange level, yeah, and, I mean, luckily, I could do them, too.  You know, I inherited her abilities, you know, and I could do them as well, so, yeah.  How did it affect you before you started having flashbacks and realized and remembered how  awful it was?  How did, how were you affected before you even knew what was, what had happened?  I was a nut.  You know, I was in nut houses and drunk all the time, and, you know, I guess by that time 
[01:30:30]  I'd been to about 30 shrinks who just would throw their hands up and go, I have no idea.  And you weren't able to convey to them what the problem was because you didn't know yet.  Yeah.  Did you have any indication that there was abuse, though?  Like, did you think that something happened, I just can't find it?  I knew something had happened.  Oh, yeah.  I knew something.  I just can't find it.  And that's a weird feeling walking around.  You know, there's something wrong with me.  I don't know what it is.  And I'm scared for no reason.  And I'm mad for no reason. 
[01:31:00]  You know, and I'm self-destructive for reasons which are not explaining.  What happened to me, I wonder?  Yeah.  Jesus.  Probably.  I was just thinking the same thing.  I'm like, dude, you're fucking describing what I think in my head.  It really is frightening to know that somebody can push that back so far that you don't even  know it happened until something comes out because then you're just constantly walking  around going, all right, when's it going to pop out?  Well, you know, mental illness, and this is not original.  I don't really have original thoughts, but mental illness is really not an airborne virus. 
[01:31:30]  I mean, it comes from somewhere specific.  It's not like a newspaper that blows up against your leg.  Yeah.  You know, and you don't exhibit aberrant behavior by accident.  And, you know, it comes from somewhere, and it usually involves stories and, you know,  actual events.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, we were talking about that earlier, as a matter of fact, earlier today.  Was your dad protective?  Like, what kind of dad would, because did he see this stuff?  Usually a lot of times you hear about the father being abusive and the mother kind of, 
[01:32:00]  you know.  Well, he was a traveling salesman, and he was gone at least two weeks a month.  And my father was a soldier who just kind of stayed a soldier.  I mean, I think, you know, soldiers are glorious things, I mean, to me.  And they're great things.  And he could not undo that.  You know, like, once you become a warrior, you kind of stay a warrior.  And so it's hard to be pumping gas in Westport, Mississippi, when you were flying, you know,  a B-52 three days earlier upside down in Guatemala or Guam, you know. 
[01:32:30]  It's difficult to do that when you've settled all your disputes with your fists and with a gun.  I mean, when you become a soldier, you make a decision.  It's an internal decision.  I'm going to be a warrior, and I'm going to fight war by the nature of war.  And it's not going to be nice.  But our house was about Nazis.  My father walking around all the time talking about Nazis.  Really?  Anthony's is, too.  Yeah, exactly.  I mean, just, you know, obsessed with the fact that if you were to lay down, if the cops 
[01:33:00]  were to retire or if the soldiers were to lay down their arms, obsessed with the fact that  someone would come and take away our ability to play Little League baseball.  And that's what we talked about.  And not the Nazis.  It would be that there are such things as bad guys, and he wished that weren't true.  You know what I mean?  I mean, like, I've had my ass saved by cops twice.  You know, I don't know why you want to kill someone on TV, but people do, you know?  I mean, especially a comic. 
[01:33:30]  And the first time was the NYPD.  The second time was about a month ago in the French Quarter in New Orleans.  I was having baked potatoes.  This is a place I go to for their baked potatoes.  Okay, all right.  That's not consequential.  So I'm sitting there, and minding my business, completely sober, you know, had a great day.  I went to the Saints game.  Drew Brees broke the record.  It was fantastic.  And I'm sitting in this booth.  This is an example of what I mean about bad guys and punks that just come out of nowhere. 
[01:34:00]  And I'm sitting there, and a white dude gets in and puts his arm around me.  I mean, an alpha male.  He puts his arm around me and says to me, we thought you might want us to sit with you.  While two of his friends get in the booth across from me.  And I said, excuse me.  Excuse me.  I have to get out.  And I get out.  I go to the waitress.  I go, in New Orleans, do people sit at each other's table? 
[01:34:30]  She goes, now he's an asshole.  You just wait here.  And she goes running outside.  I swear to God, four minutes later, you know how everyone has tough cops?  Well, New Orleans' baddest cops are, as it were, in a good sense, are in the French Quarter.  Where crazy people act crazy.  I mean, four seconds later, it looked like the New Orleans Saints on horses, like, in cop gear.  And giant guys pull up.  And I go up to this cop and I go, you know, sir, I don't want any problems. 
[01:35:00]  I love your city.  But there is something going on in there.  And I'm going to go home because I don't want no problems.  This is exactly what he sounded like.  He said, there ain't going to be no problem.  I was like, whoa.  Buford T. Justice?  No.  I was thinking, you know, like, the Terminator is a black dude.  And so he walks up to the, I mean, you know, I mean, you never see people that are just designed to deal with punks.  I mean, they're just designed to deal with punks.  You know, I mean, that's what they do. 
[01:35:30]  And it's a great service.  So they were still at your table?  You vacated and they were still there?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He walks up to them and he says to them, how y'all doing?  And, you know, they start talking in a different tone.  I mean, I don't want to say they sounded like flies, but they were about that small.  And they're like, well, we were just having our thing, officer, and we just, and he's just like, this is what he said to them.  And I can't say it verbatim, but I'm going to tell you, I'm going to give you a paraphrase. 
[01:36:00]  He said, you know, the French Quarter is about choices and choices we make.  And, you know, you could choose just to sit here and be a good person to eat a meal and go home.  Oh, you could choose to act the fool.  And then they call us and then we come and change your attitude.  And how do you think we do that?  Oh, man.  He goes, I'm going to give you a hint.  It don't involve them little moist towelettes they have on the airplane.  And they're like, well, I guess we would just be mowsing the lawn and stuff and a thing like that. 
[01:36:30]  These guys get up and walk out.  And he says to me, he says, no, you just sit down there and enjoy your dinner.  And I was like, well, yeah, all right.  Thank you, officer.  He looks back at me and then he turns and looks back.  He goes, by the way, I love the way you do Bill Clinton.  Oh, that's great.  Isn't that cool?  Very cool.  Yeah.  Well, that's some power, too, you know?  Yeah.  Now, when I say, I remember these were the things that were said. 
[01:37:00]  Maybe my prepositions and conjunctions are a little off.  But basically, that's what it was.  Yeah.  So that goes back to my dad, who's like saying, people have to do this.  Sorry.  People have to deal with punks.  I don't know.  You've never dealt with them personally?  Like, are you the kind of guy that would?  Scared my whole life.  Yeah, yeah.  Scared to death.  But this is the odd thing about it was that was the first time in my life where I felt  like I'm not going to run from these guys, you know? 
[01:37:30]  I mean, I was stalked in New York City.  I mean, my life was threatened.  I mean, it's hard to be doing an impression on Saturday Night Live when there's NYPD detectives  combing the audience, looking for weapons.  Wow.  That's really hard.  You were afraid that this person had showed up and was going to do you harm while you were  on the air.  Well, I mean, they sneak stuff in there.  People sneak things in there all the time.  And you don't hear about them because they have these great NYPD detectives that they  try to sneak stuff in.  I mean, so far as I know, they've never been successful. 
[01:38:00]  But, I mean, you know, you're up there and you're doing your Trump impression or something.  And these guys are walking around and they got these hawk eyes looking.  Wow, man.  And they want to see if something's being pointed at you or...  Well, they're looking for plastic stabbing things, things that you can smuggle past the  detector.  Right.  Now, you were stalked because you do talk about it in the book.  Was it a woman that you had slept with or was it just a fan or an ex-girlfriend?  Somebody that I met at the cellar who I had back, you know, to my house and she had someone 
[01:38:30]  else's eyes, you know, like she went in the bathroom and she came out and someone else  was living in there.  Oh, yeah.  Was her name Yela?  Yeah.  That was Yela.  You know Yela.  Yeah, Yela's one of the managers at the cellar.  Oh, stop it.  It wasn't that Yela.  I know.  I was kidding.  I thought it was someone that you were probably with.  I mean, no, but I mean, if she was a good looking girl, you probably banged her one time. 
[01:39:00]  No, I'm married.  Oh, I mean, back in the day.  Yeah, back in the day.  Yeah, back in the day is what I'm saying.  Yeah.  I'll take it out of it.  Anyway, so I was like, oh, my God.  You recognize the look in the eyes.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that look that a lizard gives a fly.  You know, that kind of look.  I was like, oh, man.  You know, and I said, I have to leave.  I got to meet someone.  I got a crisis.  And then it started, you know.  How was she when you said, when you said, we both have to leave because I have something 
[01:39:30]  to do?  Like, you thought you were smart to think of an excuse.  Did she catch on something was wrong?  And she was like, oh, okay.  She was sputtering, spit, and snot.  Oh, wow.  No.  No.  No.  Like that.  That's crazy.  Yeah.  She called me 50 times in that hour.  I'm going to kill you.  She didn't say that.  I'm going to kill you at first, which they never do right at first.  I mean, they don't say the stupid.  I mean, like, you know, the cops told me, like, you know, in order to arrest somebody, 
[01:40:00]  they have to actually threaten you.  And the only way to violate the First Amendment is to threaten someone.  I mean, or say something destructive.  And so the thing he says, you know, we have to be calm.  She's going to get madder and madder and madder.  And then she's going to do something stupid.  You know, and that's what that's their phraseology.  Something stupid.  Something stupid.  Yeah.  That means, ah, we can do something.  Yeah.  Now we can put it through the system, as they call it.  Yeah.  Which cannot be fun.  No.  When they start fucking that, when you got to go and get a lawyer and you got to make 
[01:40:30]  court appearances and, ah.  You know, the New York District Attorney's Office, they're very serious people.  Yeah.  And they just, they came down like thunder.  I mean, just thunder.  And she went away.  I mean, they have said that these people, they don't want that.  It's not that important.  Really?  For the most part, yeah.  The NYPD, New York District Attorney.  No.  This was something we were thinking about when we were drinking Goldschlager, you know,  in Williamsburg. 
[01:41:00]  And we thought, and I lost my time.  No.  I'm sorry.  You know, like that.  But punk's back down like that.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  And anyway, that's why, so you'd think a guy that was on SNL, you know, is doing all  these impressions and, you know, it's a very, you know, liberal, sarcastic place, as it  should be.  But you'd think I would be like, I'm not really like that.  I was never really like Republican or a Democrat.  I was sort of like, um, uh, soldiers and cops.  Yeah, yeah.  That's kind of what our house was, yeah. 
[01:41:30]  Did you, when you, when you, uh, you talk about, there's a lot of great stuff in the  book and about, uh, Clinton and Cheney and all these guys on polar opposite sides of the  spectrum.  And when you, when you're in, like you, you're in close proximity with these people, are they  pretty much the same guys?  Like you don't see a big difference between them ideologically?  No, I see something, I mean, whether you like or dislike them, I see something extraordinary  about them.  There is something unusual about them.  I mean, I don't think you rise to power on earth, on this earth and become a world leader. 
[01:42:00]  Someone that can make a call and affect something in, in Asia, uh, by accident, I think you  have to have something unusual.  And, you know, the thing I noticed about Cheney was that, um, he had good kids.  I, when I went to his house, I thought, you know what?  He, he has good kids, you know, like our house didn't have good kids.  He has good kids.  He had to have something to do with that.  So, I mean, my father, you know, uh, he sent my father a note, you know, one time and made  my dad feel real good when he was dying. 
[01:42:30]  What was his note about it?  Oh, just thanks for your support.  But the fact that it came from the vice president's office, a guy who had fought to keep a vice  president's office had gone mad, had seen horrors, these, what these soldiers do to, so there  would be a vice president's office.  I mean, it meant a lot to him, you know?  I mean, he was dying of cancer at the time and on those horrible pain pills that are  not fun pain pills, you know, like where it's just like, so that you won't like die  of shock. 
[01:43:00]  I forget what the name of the damn thing was, but it was strong.  It was like, they give him a hospice, right?  Uh, yeah, but they also like, you can start getting morphine before you get to hospice,  but then there's, damn, there's this one.  I forget.  It's like on Michael Jackson level.  Uh, wow.  Yeah, like it's propofol or something like I had propofol once when I got a, um, a colonoscopy  and, um, you know, this is another thing about doing Clinton, like girls come up and try  to meet me and then they realize I'm not him and you can always see that look come over 
[01:43:30]  their eyes like, Oh man, he's not even that funny.  He just sits there, he's just a sad guy sitting there and he's not Bill Clinton at all.  Apparently this was all an act, you know, and I was afraid of having the camera put in there,  you know, where it's, you know what I mean?  Yeah.  In your ass.  Yeah, of course.  Where it's not supposed to be. 
[01:44:00]  I mean, my visits to proctologists are horror stories to me, that shit hurts, you know?  And so now it's going to be this object and, and they give me the propofol just seconds  before.  And, um, and the woman's about, I mean, the man is about to put in the camera and the anesthesiologist  leans in and goes, what would Clinton say?  Oh no.  Oh yes.  And I wanted to say to her, you know, you're like, you try to think of a line.  I'm like, Oh man, I'm whacked out of my mind. 
[01:44:30]  I wanted to say something to her like, you know, what is a nice girl like you doing in  a place like that?  You know, point to my ass.  But, um, anyway, it was, you just panicked and fell asleep.  I did.  I, I, I wiped out.  And then I, I woke up the next, uh, you know, after it was all over and you know, you wonder  why people are into that drug.  I mean, all of a sudden I had had, I'd gone back through my life, but this time it had  all worked out.  I had gotten the prom queen and hit the home run and throw the touchdown pass.  That's how I felt. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  You know, and I go to my shrink like an hour later, she's like, what's different about  you?  You just seem so crisp and bright.  Yeah.  I'm on drugs.  I said, I got, I got the state of the art drug.  You understand?  I got this.  I mean, I was going down the West side highway and there's like a trapeze school.  I'm like, I'm trying, I get, I'm trying that.  The trapeze down there.  I'm like, I'm doing the trapeze, you know, and, uh, and I know I'm going to make the Yankees.  I know it.  Just outgoing Daryl.  That's what tequila used to do for me too. 
[01:45:30]  Like in Cozumel, I'd be down there.  I'd like that tequila is so acid, like unusual.  I mean, I would leave the bar going, I got to get up early and start training because I  figured it out why I couldn't hit that curve ball.  And now you know, yeah.  Yeah.  And then you wake up, you wake up with a broken nose and a ditch.  That's the odd thing about booze.  For, for how good it makes you feel when you're, when you're doing it, it's, it's 10 times worse  when you're hung over and just feel like shit the next day. 
[01:46:00]  And every, cause then every kind of thought that the alcohol put out of your head comes  crawling back with an amplifier on it.  Yeah.  I had a drunk dream the other night that I drank.  I haven't drank in 26 years, but I had, I was drinking, oh, Calure, on mudslides.  Tough guy.  It was so good.  I used to love those.  I used to love those.  I had a slice of rum cake.  I dreamt, I dreamt I was building a dollhouse and sipping a margarita.  That's good.  I think, you know, when you, you've gone too far, when you're on stage in Tijuana at a 
[01:46:30]  donkey show and you're facing the audience and you're doing comedy and you're saying,  any birthdays, how many people are married?  My wife, she's here.  I have a garage door for sale.  Thank you.  I'm Rich Voss.  Well, this is odd.  We're being told that Daryl has to go?  845 he has to.  I know.  It said until 845.  Roland is now being told he has to leave now?  Whoa. 
[01:47:00]  What the hell's that about?  I don't know.  Oh, boy.  Huh?  Uh-oh.  Who's that guy?  That guy's important.  That's my manager, Rory.  That guy just went down.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This crazy book is like...  Yeah, we didn't even mention the book.  It's called God, if you're not up there, I'm fucked.  Which was my prayer when I was in jail in the Caribbean because I didn't know any prayers.  And I realized, you know how that crazy feeling you have when you're like, you know what?  I'm in so much trouble, I can't hire no one to get me out.  Oh, God.  No doctor, no lawyer, no nobody. 
[01:47:30]  I'm in the Caribbean in a jail cell with feces on the floor and I can't be helped.  So maybe I'm hoping there's like a God.  You know what I mean?  Because I didn't know how to pray.  So that was my first prayer.  Then I felt silly about that.  I actually asked the guard for a Bible.  I was like, I need a Bible.  You were going to find God real quick?  I mean, you know, guys like me don't go to Jesus unless they're in big-ass trouble.  You're like, maybe Jesus?  They say he can help?  I'd have heard.  What was the problem down there? 
[01:48:00]  Possession, controlled substance.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And they take that very seriously.  Yeah, yeah.  You were set up, though.  I mean, you were set up.  I was told I was set up, yeah.  But, I mean, I was in a bathroom and this guy had been trying to sell me Coke all night.  Yeah, he came in the stall with me and he said that back down there they give out samples of Coke or drugs to ship employees, you know, when they see your ship employee. 
[01:48:30]  And so they're like, here, you know, if you'll be back next week, you might want some of this.  So he gave me a dollar bill with dust in it and I thought, well, I'm going to be killed and raped.  And I said, all right, that'll be fine.  That will be fine.  I put it in my pocket.  I walk outside, walk down the stairs.  I'm arrested.  Wow.  Yeah.  Here's the funny part.  When I'm on trial, like I call my dad to come down and he comes down and, you know, they said get $5,000 cash, you know, they let you know while you're in jail that $5,000 cash might get you out of this. 
[01:49:00]  I'm like, I don't know anyone that has $5,000 cash.  I mean, we're not wealthy.  We're not.  We're poor.  Yeah.  And so my dad comes down and he comes walking up there and he, and this man comes up and says to him, I will get your son off for $500 cash. 
[01:49:30]  And he says, I'll give you $200 right now and I'll give you $300 if you get them off.  And we go in there and we sit down.  I said, dad, do you think it's going to work out?  And he looked at me and he went, I don't know.  I don't know right now.  You know?  So this guy gets up there and he's like, your honor.  He had only a little bit in his crumpled up dollar bill.  We couldn't even weigh it, your honor.  I mean, it might have been sold, your honor.  I meant that, like, this well-polished speech. 
[01:50:00]  You could tell they've done this dance before.  I thought he was quite good.  I thought he's impressive.  This guy's good.  This whole thing about it could have been sold.  Nobody analyzed.  I mean, you know, your honor, he's an American citizen with no criminal record, your honor.  But they call him your worshipfulness.  And so, not predictably, I'm in a prisoner's docket.  And, you know, when they say, well, the defendant rise and you're in the Caribbean and you're on a drug charge, right? 
[01:50:30]  Scary?  Yeah.  You've got to think you're going away.  I thought I was going away because they told me I was going to do three years in that same cell I was in by myself.  And the guy charges me $1,500 cash.  But the weird part was, as a formality, the guy that gave me the drugs was in the docket with me.  He was not even addressed in the trial.  Okay?  Not even spoken to in the trial.  So, afterwards, this bailiff who was apparently new at this said, your worshipfulness is with him. 
[01:51:00]  The judge goes, stop.  The charges are dropped.  Come on.  Come on.  So, my father's like, the guy gets out and the guy's standing outside and my father gives, they say, go over here to this office and give us the $1,500 cash.  My father walks up to this guy and gives them this look.  He's like, you know you're getting killed, right?  You're getting killed.  You and every son of a bitch you ever met are getting killed.  You understand that, right? 
[01:51:30]  Because this is what I do.  Oh, man.  And you said on the way home, he was plotting.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  We get in the car and we drive away and we see the lawyer, the drug dealer, and the cops smoking cigarettes.  Oof.  And my father looks back at them and he goes, they're all getting killed.  I'm killing all of them.  I'm going to bring guns into this island.  I know people that I used to, you know, that are in the service, that are mercenaries, and we'll come back and we're going to kill all of them son of bitches.  The captain, the judge, the law, you know.  You got shook down, basically. 
[01:52:00]  It was a shakedown.  Yeah.  Yeah, and, you know, that goes back to the thing about, you know, soldiers.  His first impulse was, just kill them.  Kill these son of bitches.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the way you deal with it.  That's what you do.  You just kill them.  And I want to plug your gig, too.  I'm sorry, Darrell.  It's this, we didn't know, this Thursday through Sunday, he'll be here in Carolines.  212-757-4100.  I don't even know if you need plugs for that, but a great comment.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I always need plugs.  I need help. 
[01:52:30]  And this, so it's six shows, I'm guessing, one Thursday, one Sunday, two Fridays, Saturday.  Oh, nice.  Carolines is great, yeah.  We love that place.  It was interesting to me, though, to see, having known you all these years, where all this, because you're a brilliant impressionist, and you're a brilliant comic,  but then to see where all this stuff came from, it's like, yeah, comics were all fucked up.  Yeah, yeah.  But can you describe how you see a voice?  Because that, to me, was fascinating.  Like, when people hear a voice, and you try to do the impression, you just try to go by, how do you see a voice? 
[01:53:00]  Colors?  I thought that was very interesting.  Different colors, yeah.  Like, I was not able to do even the simplest math problem, so they sent me to this experimental class, where they taught math using colors.  Like, I don't know how to put it any better than that.  And I could do math.  And so, I guess I respond to that, and so I would always attach a color to everybody I was playing.  But do you attach it on purpose, or will you hear a voice and you see a color?  No, it's before.  The color's first. 
[01:53:30]  What do you do?  Like, you'll hear someone talk, and you just see blue?  Yeah.  I feel it and see it.  Yeah.  And you said you see the words written out in your head.  Like, you see a color, and then you'll see the words as if they're on paper in the color?  Like, I like floating.  Yeah.  Just like, I don't know how to describe it.  You know, like, you know, the first time I did Al Sharpton, he was blue, you know?  I mean, it just, I was like.  You were off a little on that color. 
[01:54:00]  I was like, well.  It's called the blueberry pie was on his face.  Well, like, Geraldo was black and red, and, you know, Clinton was orange.  I mean, just, this couple was, you know, was blue, Donahue, yellow, Leno, orange, yeah.  Oh, so are certain voice types color-coded, or no?  No, no.  There's no rhyme or reason for it?  No, no, no.  Jeez, that's so weird, man.  Will you see the color while you're doing them?  Nope.  Only when you're first trying to figure it out.  It's just something I feel underneath, and I don't know how to put it any other way.  When you're doing a voice, are you able, I mean, as a stand-up, of course, 
[01:54:30]  but when you say you're doing a voice on TV, and you always said that one you would never  thrilled with was you were never thrilled with the way you did, I think, McCain.  Well, that's because he was a soldier, and I didn't want to do that.  You know, having been through the ordeals that he had been through, the way he moved  and spoke had to have been affected by that, and I didn't want to ape it.  That's just the way it was.  You know, that was the job.  I mean, Lauren had been great to my daughter.  I wanted to, you know, be good for him and all that, and I really tried, but I could never 
[01:55:00]  pull the trigger on it.  I just couldn't.  I just really couldn't.  I mean, my father had just died.  There had been a military funeral.  I just didn't want to, and yet I didn't want to let Lauren down.  I was really stuck.  You know what I mean?  What do you do when you're in a sketch?  And sometimes when you're, because I've never seen anyone on SNL break the fourth wall.  Okay.  I have five times.  You have?  Yeah, out of several hundred appearances, yeah.  What do you do if you're in a sketch and it's not going well?  And I've seen performers do that. 
[01:55:30]  It seems like it's so difficult as opposed to a stand-up where your instinct is just to  address it and, you know, and make it better.  Because you can go to the audience.  Oh, wait.  That didn't go the way I wanted it to.  Oh, boy, does this stink.  Like, oh, whatever we do.  You just melt and catch on fire.  I mean, we did a show called Riding My Donkeys, you know, and Lauren had always said, they're  donkeys, okay?  They're not like normal animals.  I mean, they're donkeys, all right?  They're not going to do, you ever hear stubborn as a donkey, stubborn as a mule? 
[01:56:00]  They're not going to do what you want them to do.  They're just, they're donkeys.  And so we're on donkeys, you know, it's me and Tim Meadows and Anna Gosteyer and I believe  Will was, Farrell was in it and I was doing Sam Donaldson, you know, and up there and  then we chartered a plane and we went to St. Louis, you know, and doing this thing.  And these damn donkeys, at one point, my donkey, like, he turned his donkey head and out of  his corner of his donkey eye, he looked at my crotch and I think he said in donkey voice, 
[01:56:30]  are those balls?  Because he started going for my crotch, which led us all to, the whole sketch fell apart  because my donkey wanted to bite me, my balls.  And so during Dress and Air, between Dress and Air, they gave them donkey Valium.  Oh, wow.  Sedated them.  Calm them down a little bit.  All they did was make them high and now they wanted to be donkeys.  They did not want to stand there and they started bucking. 
[01:57:00]  And we started laughing.  Yeah.  And laughed.  We all laughed and laughed and laughed.  I've never seen that.  Well, did you ever see the Tony Soprano sketch when Molly Shannon put her crotch in my face?  But she didn't do that in dress rehearsal.  She was playing this 50-year-old dancer at the Bada Bing.  So I'm sitting there telling us Tony Soprano.  And she's like, she comes up and all of a sudden, I mean, crotch in the face.  All right.  And I said, I wanted to say, Jija fucking crashed. 
[01:57:30]  Jija.  You know how Tony Soprano says Jesus?  Jija fucking crashed.  But I didn't, of course.  I laughed.  I started laughing.  I couldn't help it.  We're totally getting the rap sign now.  All right.  Man.  Maybe they would just want to say it.  Yeah, dude.  I.  Man.  There was fucking.  Come on.  Keep going.  The one.  The one.  The one.  The book.  There was a moment I read.  And we will wrap down.  The book is called God, if you're not up there, I'm fucked. 
[01:58:00]  It's fucking.  I can't say enough things about it.  And he's at Caroline's this Thursday through Sunday doing his stand up.  The part that really frightened me was we talk about the scene of your mother holding you.  And can you talk about where she took the knife on your tongue?  Because the helplessness, that brought out a really weird feeling of helplessness.  I've found with the monsters I've known, the way to survive them is to behave as if it's not occurring.  That something else is happening. 
[01:58:30]  Because their psyche depends on believing that something bad isn't happening.  That something right is happening.  So that was when I just sort of first realized I have to be calm and behave as if something else is occurring.  And that's when I remember the hibiscus bush sort of thumping against the window.  The wind was coming off the ocean.  And it was just silent.  And she just asked me to open my mouth.  And then she pulled out a serrated safe knife and punctured the tongue. 
[01:59:00]  She didn't cut my tongue off.  She just popped it like that.  Why would anyone do that?  Because they're monsters.  God.  Monsters.  You understand?  Fucking.  Yeah.  Wow.  And so I just remember the redness and the wetness.  And that was the flashback that I kept having at SNL was the redness and the wetness.  Because, I mean, the tongue really bleeds.  Yeah, yeah.  Your tongue really bleeds.  You know, it was just a pop.  You know, so I have like a quarter inch little cut in there. 
[01:59:30]  You still have it.  Yeah, yeah.  Makes no sense.  That's monsters.  Monsters is the only way to describe it.  Let's forget about that.  Caroline's.  Yes, Caroline's.  Yeah, that was a brilliant comic.  And we're concentrating on the sad stuff.  But that was the stuff I didn't know about you.  I mean, a lot of people know what I don't think anybody knew about this unless they were  close to you and you filled them in on it.  But this is amazing to have a book like this that really shows a lot of what you're all  about.  And I like how this how this happened. 
[02:00:00]  Biographies can be boring.  This from the literally I could not stop reading it.  I mean, I knew a lot of the people involved in it.  But even if you don't, it was and it wasn't just one horror story after next.  It would kind of fluctuate between stand up and getting SNL and going back.  It was fucking.  I love the dude.  It's one of the favorite books I've ever read.  Thank you.  And I can't recommend it enough.  So, well, it beats the shit out of it.  Well, the prosthetics were so hard to wear.  What a chore.  Yeah.  I tried to put some of that in there.  But there was enough in there to make to explain who you are and your career. 
[02:00:30]  Sure.  But like compared to the other stuff, it's like, yeah, OK, it was real difficult.  Just to remind you, these are jokes we're doing this week.  Yeah.  Caroline's will be really funny.  It's not going to be a sad affair.  He's one of my favorite comics, especially when he's down the cellar.  He's one of the guys that everybody goes down and watches.  Unlike me.  Everybody actually leaves.  Stop it.  That's just a room issue, though.  Oh, the job is heavy.  A chubby Bobby joke.  All right.  Well, unfortunately, they're saying they're giving us the rest.  She's carving get out with her wedding ring in the window. 
[02:01:00]  All right.  Well, Daryl, I love you, and I'm very, very happy for you.  Congratulations, Daryl.  It's an awesome, awesome book.  This Thursday, this Sunday, Caroline's The Great Daryl Hammond.  I'll see you downtown.  Yeah, I'll see you downtown.  Cool, man.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you so much.  All right, bye.  On the next American War Stories, Battleground, Iraq, Robert Kelly deploys and within an instant realizes no man can prepare for war. 
[02:01:30]  We thought we were going to starve, so we brought little bars and stuff, but there's going to be no food.  I gained 30 pounds in Iraq.  There was, you go to the buffet, there's Chinese food, mac and cheese, barbecue, pizza, ice cream.  You can walk up to this ice cream and get as many ice cream bars and Sundays as you want.  But no matter how rich the rewards, every American soldier has to experience loss.  I was over there. 
[02:02:00]  I had two milkshakes.  One of the Marines goes, you're going to have both of those fatty?  So I gave him one, and then my other one fell.  I had to go back and get two more.  So tune in as we chronicle the victories and the defeats for American hero, Bob Kelly.  I broke my knee, man.  On the next American War Stories.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.

[02:05:00]  We're actually doing a podcast live tonight.  No, you're doing it live.  Okay.  You normally tape?  It's normally not taped, digitized.  Digi-to-well, I use the older vernacular of tape recorded.  It's spinning wheels, motherfucker.  Yeah, tonight, Gotham Comedy Club, downstairs.  It's live.  We're having guest Bonnie McFarlane is going to be there from the My Wife Hates Me podcast,  which is also on Riotcast.  It's like a crossover, like the Jetsons meeting the Flintstones. 
[02:05:30]  Right.  But Voss is going to be there.  So we actually have Bob DeBono, who does the best Rich Voss impression, is going to actually  play Voss tonight.  That's funny, man.  Is Rich going to accuse him of having sex with Bonnie at some point?  Rich called me and apologized.  Oh, he did?  Yeah, I haven't talked to him.  I've got to talk to him.  Oh.  So tonight, we're going to be on the Gotham Comedy Club.  There's only around 10 tickets left, honestly.  There's around 10 tickets since last night at 9 o'clock. 
[02:06:00]  So if you're going to come, get your ass down there tonight.  It's 212-367-9000, Gotham Comedy Club.  There's only a few tickets left for tonight's show.  It starts at 9.30.  Doors open at 8.30.  Me, Joe DeRosa, Bonnie McFarlane, and Bob DeBono as Rich Voss.  As Rich.  Does a really good Rich Voss.  Yeah, we're going to do stand-up, too.  Everybody's going to do like 10 minutes of stand-up, and then we're going to do the podcast.  It's going to kind of be a mix and match.  It's going to be fun.  Yeah, it's going to be a good time.  Man, have you done a live one yet?  No, I never did one. 
[02:06:30]  We usually just do the podcast, but someone approached me to do it, and I was like, fuck it.  Let's go.  I'll do it.  I don't give a shit.  It might be just a fucking disaster, but that's funny, too, I guess, right?  Live is great.  You just got to do it.  Yeah, it'll be fun.  It'll be fucking fun.  Plus, we're doing comedy, though.  So a lot of these podcasts, I've done them.  It's just the podcast where they talk, which is interesting, but we're going to do comedy.  Oh, and that's going to be part of the podcast?  Yeah.  That's pretty cool.  They're going to go up.  The podcast is going to be to the left, and then there'll be a stage, and, you know,  Bonnie's going to do, like, 10, 15. 
[02:07:00]  DeRosa's going to do some time.  DeBono's going to go up and do Voss's act.  Voss's act.  For three minutes.  Fantastic.  Which is going to be hilarious.  That's great.  If you haven't heard Bob DeBono do Rich Voss, it's fucking amazing.  Yeah.  It sounds exactly like him.  You'd think he was the real person.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  But, yeah, tonight, Gotham Comedy Club, 930.  There's only a few tickets left, so don't fucking...  Oh, just show up.  We'll squeeze you in.  Yeah.  I don't give a... 
[02:07:30]  I told them, because there's only...  It's a very...  It's downstairs room.  It's not the big one.  It's the downstairs room.  So if you show up and they tell you you can't get in, just fucking come and push  your way in.  Fuck off.  I'm coming in.  Yeah.  Bobby told me.  Also, did you mention Patrice's CD?  We keep forgetting to play.  I was going to do that.  Patrice, this is awesome, too, is that number one on iTunes.  Oh, good.  Number fucking uno one on iTunes.  Mr. P.  I've listened to it three times.  It's fucking... 
[02:08:00]  It's so fucking funny.  It was hard to push play.  Yeah, yeah.  And I know a lot of people have been writing that on Twitter.  It's hard to listen to.  You've got to be in the right mood to get it going.  Fuck it.  Push play.  Listen to it.  It made me smile so much just to think about it.  But the fucking...  Yeah.  It's so funny, man.  It's so fucking funny.  Sam, on the shit show yesterday, which I was forced to listen to, no other station would  work in my vehicle.  So I had to listen to it. 
[02:08:30]  You played a clip.  What was it?  When the cops were touching him.  He doesn't like cops touching him.  Yeah, from his new album.  Touching him and stuff.  It's so fucking funny, man.  That bit was great.  You know what's great about it, too?  Is that he goes off at one point on this dude's name.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I forget his name.  Tulu or something.  Tulu.  There's a bit.  It's called Tulu, I think it's called.  And I was like, what the fuck is that?  And it's him just going off on this dude's name for a few minutes.  And I love that.  Because they don't do that on CDs anymore.  It's joke, joke, joke, joke, joke.  Rehearse, rehearse. 
[02:09:00]  It's the joke that he rehearsed for fucking the last two years.  And it's exactly the way he fucked.  And there's nothing spontaneous about it.  Like in comedy clubs, you fuck off a little bit once in a while.  Yeah, yeah.  And he put that in his CD, which is great.  That's Patrice.  It works.  Well, he's the best.  He can look down and just use that finger and point.  He talks about this lady's face.  Like, I know what you are.  He doesn't talk to her.  He talks to a friend.  Yeah, that's what he does.  Yes, he talks to another person, their friend, about the person. 
[02:09:30]  Right to that.  Like, they're not even fucking there.  It's the funniest.  That is one of his things.  Yes.  Oh.  It's the funniest, degrading.  Yeah.  Oh, my God, Patrice.  And only he could get away with it without somebody flipping out.  I remember if I tried to do what Patrice did or anybody, you'd fucking be an asshole.  Yeah.  Like, I used to go to the Brazilian steakhouse.  And he would, the dessert tray would come by, and he would stick his finger in every  dessert.  Like, just sit there and go, what's this?  Yeah. 
[02:10:00]  What's this?  What's that?  And what's that?  And put his finger.  And it would, the two Brazilian broads would die laughing.  Everybody.  The manager would be like, oh, what's this?  This big, you know.  That giant finger just poking it.  So one night, I tried to do it.  I was with my wife.  We were there.  The dessert tray comes over.  I go, what's this?  And she goes, sir, you have to buy that.  If you're going to, you can't stick your finger in it.  And I was like, I'll take, okay, I'll take this.  Yeah.  I don't even like flan, but I'll take it.  Oh, somebody tried to be charming. 
[02:10:30]  I tried.  Oh, boy.  Because you're not, Patrice was charming, even though he was a creep.  Exactly.  That was my point.  You're not a charming guy.  You're a fucking, you're a mean-spirited guy.  Neither are you, though.  No reason to hold me into your fucking charmless life.  I'm just holding up a mirror.  You're absolutely right.  I'm not the one putting my fucking finger in people's desserts, am I?  No.  You're absolutely right.  Bobby comes off as a problem in that situation.  I'm saying Patrice is charming, and Bob is it, and Bob goes, you neither.  That doesn't address the role.  You neither.  I just held him a mirror.  I apologize.  That's what I do in panic situations when my feelings get hurt. 
[02:11:00]  You too.  You too.  Yeah, but his CD is out.  I gifted it.  I already got it.  And if you already got it, it's a good thing to actually, you can gift it.  Go buy another one.  I think it's, what is it?  Ten bucks, right?  $9.99.  $9.99.  I just tried to buy it on my phone, and they're like, you've already purchased this item.  That's a bargain.  Yeah, you could actually gift it.  If you look over to the left, you can send it to somebody else, which is awesome, too.  So if you already bought it, go buy another copy for somebody else, which is good.  It's a great gift for a woman, but you have to send a little note with her.  Please listen to this, you uptight bitch. 
[02:11:30]  You've got to listen to the end of it.  The last three bits, I think, I love my dog, stay a hoe.  Start a hoe, stay a hoe.  Start a hoe, stay a hoe.  I love my dog.  Start a hoe, stay a hoe.  He should teach a class.  Yeah, yeah.  He should just go to colleges and teach women.  It's so fucking funny.  He talks about his dog needs him and does, and it's okay.  He doesn't pretend he doesn't. 
[02:12:00]  That's why he loves his dog.  His dog doesn't pretend he doesn't need him.  He's like, I need you, mother.  He goes, I'm up here having up here fun, and my dog's like, I want to come.  I want to come, but my legs are too small.  Up here fun.  Up here fun.  Yeah, he goes, up here fun.  Oh, motherfucker.  He was brilliant.  And he goes, please pick me up, pick me up, pick me up.  And I picked the motherfucker, and he just, thank you.  Thank you for letting me out.  He goes, my chick doesn't.  It's so fucking funny, man.  Up here fun.  It's great, man.  It's a really fucking hilarious CD. 
[02:12:30]  So make sure you do it.  Yeah.  Very cool.  And all the money goes to his family.  Yeah.  His family, which is really good.  And then you can do the Audible, too.  Audible and get all the stuff over there for 20 bucks.  Yeah, 20 hours or 16 hours.  20 hours of his shit.  It's unbelievable.  Oh.  And what else?  Very good.  What?  Oh.  My buddy Ty is here.  Ty?  What's he got a yellow ribbon or something?  Oh, I don't know.  Oh, no.  Does he work in a suit place?  Oh, God, Chip.  Oh, God, Chip.  Get off me.  Hey, Chip.  No, he's a director. 
[02:13:00]  Anthony.  Yes, I know.  I am Chip.  Chip is.  Well, and it's funny because we were talking about Atlanta before.  And this weekend, I'll be here.  But the 16th or 18th, I'll be in Atlanta.  Where are you going?  What club?  A punchline.  And I have to plug real quick.  February 23-25, Fort Lauderdale.  March 1-2-3, Rochester.  And March 29 through April 1, Caroline's here in New York.  Wow.  And I'm going to cancel Toledo if it hasn't been canceled already.  Why?  Because I'm shooting something in Cleveland. 
[02:13:30]  I've been to Toledo Funny Bone?  What is it?  Yes, I'm going to cancel.  I've been there.  It's actually a pretty good club.  My agent hasn't canceled that yet.  He is a fired agent.  They have chocolate-covered bacon at the store right next to the hotel.  Well, that sounds good.  Just FYI.  That would be something you have.  My fucking reflux would kill me.  No.  It was take a pill.  Have some.  Take a pill.  Oh, God, was it good.  I walked into that stupid place.  I go, what's this?  That's chocolate-covered bacon.  I was like, sounds like a real comedy of errors.  What? 
[02:14:00]  I hope Chip dies.  That made no sense.  I hope he dies.  I hate Chip.  At all.  Chocolate-covered bacon does not even sound good.  Chocolate-covered bacon does not sound good.  It's fan-fucking-tastic.  How could it be?  Because it's bacon with chocolate.  Is it crispy or is it soggy or bacon?  No, it's raw bacon.  It's raw.  That they dip in chocolate.  Yeah.  It's crispy.  Because sometimes bacon.  There's no other way of bacon.  No, I find bacon better if it's got a little elasticity to it still.  Like, not crispy, but it's cooked.  You're not talking well-bunned bacon. 
[02:14:30]  You're talking.  It's cooked, but I like it a little, like, I like it to go, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You like bacon that you could, like, spin in a circle or something?  I don't know.  No, Chip.  In a circle?  Oh, God.  Yeah, I like that.  Chocolate-covered bacon is phenomenal.  Chocolate and bacon doesn't seem like it should go together.  It's fucking salty and sweet, man.  It's like a chip.  You ever have a chocolate-covered potato chip?  What's that?  No.  Oh, dude, you have to get a chocolate-covered potato chip.  Like that?  It's fucking phenomenal.  Oh, fuck.  Chocolate-covered potato chips. 
[02:15:00]  Like that?  Listen to me.  Chocolate-covered potato chips are unbelievable.  Un-fucking-believable.  Take a seat, there, Ty.  What is it?  Chocolate-covered potato chips.  Chip, chip, chip, chocolate chips.  Hi, buddy.  How are you?  Bobby's trying to describe chocolate-covered fucking everything.  Chocolate-covered potato chips.  You ever have one?  And every time he says chip.  They're fucking amazing, aren't they?  Chocolate-covered potato chips.  Shut up.  I'm going to fucking kill him.  I hate him.  I hate him.  I wish he was a different person because I'd punch him. 
[02:15:30]  So you're not eating them.  You're just talking about them?  What's that?  No, we're not eating them now.  We're talking about chocolate.  Yeah.  That's how much of an impact they made.  They were, yeah, they're good.  Well, other than that, we had nothing else to talk about, so.  You were talking about chocolate-covered bacon, and it sounds horrible.  Well, the hotel near Jimmy in Toledo that he had to cancel,  he's missing out on the chocolate-covered bacon, which sounds horrible,  but is fucking rather fantastic.  It sounds good, though.  It actually sounds good.  It actually is really good.  I've had it before.  Is it really?  There's a great restaurant in L.A. called Animal. 
[02:16:00]  Have you guys ever been there?  Oh, I've been, you know something?  Uh-oh.  Melissa dragged me to that place.  It's all like fucking, you could get like a snake bladders and fucking all kinds of weird kind of...  It's like head cheese and weird shit like that.  Yeah, weird shit.  Love head cheese.  And I'm like, I don't know what to eat.  I just want a fucking like regular real food.  What'd you have?  I think it was some kind of...  No, she was having foie gras, and I'm like, I don't want to...  Foie gras sucks.  I love it.  And then there was something else, like some kind of...  Well, also, Animal, if you get the regular thing, like the skirt steak, it sucks. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, you have to be brave and get crazy stuff, but they have a dessert that's like a chocolate  bacon thing, and it's pretty good.  Really?  Chocolate bacon, it's just fucking amazing.  They have bacon ice cream, which is unbelievable.  You love bacon, Bobby.  Listen, it's like cannibalism, isn't it?  I gotta fuck...  I gotta fuck...  He's just mean.  He's just a mean person.  Really, he's mean to the core.  That's what Norton is.  He's mean to the core.  That's my last name. 
[02:17:00]  Everybody's having a good time.  His voice comes on.  Everybody's just like, ugh.  It's just mean.  I bring laughter wherever I go.  Now you do.  Do you?  Yeah.  Well, Ty, you've been going all over the country.  I have.  This guy's been all over the place now.  He's a director.  Really?  Bobby, yes.  That's great.  That's fantastic.  He's got a movie out called The Innkeepers.  It's very scary.  Very...  Also, very clever.  Very funny.  Really?  It's a funny comedy.  I enjoyed the shit out of it. 
[02:17:30]  It's a horror film more than a comedy.  Yeah, yeah.  It's scary.  And tonight, this is fucking, like, crazy.  Yeah.  This is crazy.  So we filmed the movie in Torrington, Connecticut.  And we filmed it at a hotel called The Yankee Peddler.  It's a real hotel.  And it's supposed to be haunted.  And so I made this sort of ghost story about this haunted hotel.  But I just set it in a real haunted hotel.  And we made it there.  And so tonight, the town wanted to have a premiere for the movie because they're in the middle of nowhere.  And they don't really get, you know, an indie movie up in Torrington, Connecticut.  So we were like, yeah, sure. 
[02:18:00]  We'll help you out.  We can lend you a print of the movie.  And they sold 1,700 tickets in two weeks.  And so now it's, like, this whole craze in the town.  So they flew us in.  And we're going back up for this, like, premiere there tonight.  And so we're going to go see the movie in this old theater with 1,700 people.  And then when it's over, we walk across the street to the actual hotel where we shot the movie and have a party.  But we didn't really change the hotel very much.  So it's going to be like you watch the movie.  And then you walk across the street.  And you're in the movie.  You're in the same hotel. 
[02:18:30]  And the people who work there wear the same clothes as they do in the movie.  And it's just going to be a very surreal experience.  That's crazy.  And I'm staying there.  You're going.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm going.  Now, I'm a little, I'm a pussy.  I'm kind of frightened to stay in this hotel because it's known to be a haunted hotel.  I hope you wake up with a white lady in a dress.  No, not a white lady.  Not a white lady.  I said I was scared.  No, I.  There are no black ghosts.  I've never heard of a black ghost.  You're right.  There aren't. 
[02:19:00]  I've never heard of a black ghost or a midget ghost.  It's only.  Move on.  It's white ladies.  White ladies and little kids.  They always just go toward the light and go, this has to be a better place.  This has to be a better place in the light.  I'm not hanging around here any longer.  You're right.  Well, maybe there is something to this afterlife.  I hope you get.  I hope something.  Shut up.  I don't want anything.  Hang on.  I put it on you.  I hex you.  I bring.  Bobby.  I bring it to you now.  I bring it to you.  I bring it to you.  I bring it to you. 
[02:19:30]  I bring it to you.  No, I bring it to you.  I bring it to you.  Hex you.  Satan comes to you tonight in all its forms.  You want him.  Go to Anthony.  I just did it.  No, I'm giving you the horns.  I'm giving you the horns back.  But I had my horns.  I'm Irish Italian.  It works better.  You're not Irish Italian.  I am.  No, you're not.  Yes, I am.  What am I, Jim?  I don't know.  Here comes the joke.  Pig cow.  Pig cow.  That's just horrible.  That's just fucking terrible.  I know.  It's very terrible.  But you were giving me the fucking sign.  Listen, I just hope something happens tonight. 
[02:20:00]  No.  How great would that be for your fucking movie?  It'd be phenomenal.  To go over there.  Now, this is what happens.  You have the premiere.  Success.  Go over there.  Something happens.  He gets possessed.  Flies across the room.  I want to be possessed.  Something happens.  And then that's part two, man.  I know.  Part fucking two.  I get an extra day of plugs on the radio.  Part two of the movie right now.  I know.  I can't make another movie back up there.  I made two up there.  Because the reason this one exists, because I made a movie a couple years ago called The  House of the Devil.  And when we made that movie, we lived in that hotel.  Really?  So all this weird stuff happened to us.  So I wrote the movie about that.  And we went back and shot it. 
[02:20:30]  Never going back.  This is it.  Today is the last time.  It's the first movie on Netflix.  Can you see it?  It's called House of the Devil?  Yep.  I love watching horror movies.  It's like an 80s satanic horror movie.  I love watching horror movies that, you know, not the big ones that come out.  I love independent horror movies.  Yeah, yeah.  Fucking great.  They're fucking great, man.  And now, does this hotel have TVs in the rooms?  Yeah, yeah.  You'll be okay.  It's a normal hotel.  It's just a little bit.  Well, the funny thing is the owner was like, now the peddler's seen better days.  And it's like, how far could it have dropped off since we left? 
[02:21:00]  Yeah, right.  It wasn't so good when we were there the first time.  The peddler.  But, yeah, the Yankee peddler.  And what ghosts are supposed to be there?  Well, they have a ghost called Miss Connelly.  And I don't know the whole story, but there's a chair in the lobby that's like Miss Connelly's chair.  And you're not supposed to sit in it.  That was a real story, then, from the movie?  Well, our story is different.  But when you're there, they have their own story.  And I hope that, like, the real Luke is there.  I can't imagine him not being.  I don't know where he'd be.  Yeah.  There's a guy at the front desk named Luke who has a ghost hunting website.  And so one of the characters in my movie is sort of – it's not really based on him because there's nothing like him. 
[02:21:30]  But there is a character with a ghost hunting website, and I named him.  How – can I ask you, how is the acting in the movie?  I hope it's quite good.  Well, I actually like – because a lot of these independent horror movies, there's some good actors in it.  But then there's always that one just terrible actress that just makes me laugh.  She comes in and just makes angry face because, you know, the director is going, be angry, be angry.  You know, I love those little fuck-ups.  I like that type of –  Unfortunately, I don't think we have angry face.  But I think you'll like it nonetheless. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah, yeah.  It was very good.  There was one –  Sarah's funny and she's cute.  A bunch of creepy stuff, but there was a scene with an old man that was fucking really creepy.  Yeah, yeah.  That's – I hate that stuff.  It gets me.  It's very creepy.  That's the shit that I think about when I'm trying to go to sleep and it's dark and I'm like,  I got to turn the TV on because I'm thinking that I'm going to open my eyes and this fucker is going to be like an inch away from my face.  You know what always stuck with me is when they say, if you let Satan in, if you say, come in, I allow you in, he can. 
[02:22:30]  And that's what's holding – like, you know, you hear that?  Oh, that's it?  That's all it takes?  So sometimes when I see a horror movie, after it, I get so scared and I have to fight because in my brain it's like, let – you can come in.  Don't say, don't say.  Oh, like the evil –  If you let the ghosts – I let the ghosts come in, I allow you to be here.  Like, I want to say that.  And you have trouble keeping from saying that.  You've got to be casual.  Call him Dev.  Have you ever had – is that why you're into it?  Or are you just –  No, I don't believe in ghosts. 
[02:23:00]  I mean, this is the closest I've ever come, staying at that place.  You know, it was – it's not a scary place, so I think you'll be okay staying there.  It's just – it's a kooky place, though.  And I know.  The whole place is – the whole town is obsessed.  All they talk about is it being haunted.  And, you know, I had – I've seen doors open and close by themselves.  Really?  But I don't know if that's ghosts.  What are you talking about?  In front of grocery stores.  You ever be in your house and you open one door and the other one closes?  I have.  Come on, Bobby.  Never happened.  You ever have bacon chips? 
[02:23:30]  What's that?  God damn shit.  You've never – so you've never had an apparition?  I've never seen a ghost.  You ever heard something?  Did you ever do any, like, recordings?  We did a little bit of that.  I've seen, like I said, doors.  My TV would turn off and on by itself.  My phone would ring in my room and no one would be on the other line.  That never freaked you out?  A little bit.  But I was making a movie, so I was too stressed to be freaked out.  That was me, actually.  I was just calling to see what's up.  I have AT&T, so it fucking died out of mine.  I couldn't hear you.  I got a tweet from somebody that said, Ant's going to be possessed by a liberal. 
[02:24:00]  His head's going to spin as he does philanthropic deeds.  No!  No!  I would love to be able to write that tweet.  I'd think philanthropic, and then I'd have to go, ugh, what's another word?  You'd think, yeah, you'd think, should I write Philip?  How can you –  I know Phil, but I don't know who thropic is.  Your voice sounds stupid when you do that.  Do you know –  I love it.  Do you remember Dee Wallace from, like, Cujo, and she was the mom in E.T.?  Yeah.  Well, she's a – 
[02:24:30]  The howling.  Yeah.  She's a spiritual healer now.  And so she was in the House of the Devil, and she did, like, a reading in the hotel for us.  And so, again, it's – I don't – I still haven't seen a ghost, but having Dee there with a pendulum talking to me about the spirits she's talking to and kind of going into a trance.  I did a – I did a – I've stayed in Creepy.  I love those hotels.  I love – there's one in Salem.  I stayed with Patrice.  Me and him both did a college.  I forget what it was called.  It's one of those Salem hotels.  The irony of the two most uneducated guys in comedy doing a college together. 
[02:25:00]  Patrice?  You didn't go out to college?  Yeah, he did.  No, he didn't.  He played football for college.  Oh, fuck.  There he goes.  Fucking dumb friend.  You're both of them, then.  I went to college, too, stupid.  No, you didn't.  Yeah, I did.  I went to fine arts, dummy.  You didn't go to fine arts.  Yeah, I graduated fine arts, associate's degree.  You're the only dummy.  You can't even say it.  He meant he went to college, too.  Stupid.  See, there's a comma.  I –  See, he's – all right.  Nice talking to you.  All right.  I love those old fucking haunted hotels. 
[02:25:30]  I can smell ghosts.  All right.  Smells like old people farts.  Well, the hotel smells like that, so maybe you're right.  Does it?  Yeah.  Like musty.  It's a musty place for sure.  That oldie, oldie smell to it.  I just thought it wasn't that clean.  I did a college once where they had one of these old buildings from the fucking 1600s  or 18 – whatever the fuck it was.  1800s, whatever.  It's 200 years difference, whatever.  I know.  1800s.  You know?  It was 18 something.  Industrial revolution.  I know.  One was the witches.  We – 
[02:26:00]  I'm in the hotel.  It's old place.  It's all antique furniture.  I'm sitting there.  I'm like, fucking, this place is creeping me out.  I can smell that musty smell.  I hear somebody upstairs walking.  I'm like, oh, fuck.  I'm sharing this shit fucking place with somebody.  And the girl comes to pick me up.  I go, who's staying here?  Is the other act staying here?  She goes, no, just you.  There's nobody else in there.  I was like, somebody's upstairs.  She goes, oh, it's haunted.  Yeah, sometimes – I'm like, I'm out.  I'm out.  I go, go in and grab my bag. 
[02:26:30]  It's in the living room.  I'm not coming back here.  I'm out.  I'm not fucking staying there.  Man.  I had that in Vegas.  I was working with Dice at the old – what was the hotel that they –  Horseshoe.  Not the Horseshoe.  Casino Ranch.  No.  Lover's Lane.  Wayne Newton used to be there all the time.  Wayne Newton Inn.  What the fuck?  Desert Inn.  No.  Circus Circus Olay.  I'm looking.  Kenny.  The Mirage.  Paris.  The Stardust.  Palms.  Stardust.  Yeah, the Stardust.  It was in the Stardust. 
[02:27:00]  All right, Kelly.  Dice had a house out there, so I got to stay in his suite.  They gave him a giant suite in the building next to the hotel.  It's a small High Rollers building.  There it was.  And there had been murders there, like mob hits and stuff like that, I heard, in this place.  And Kenny and Happy Face went out with Andrew.  I was really sick.  I had, like, the flu or something, so I stayed in the room.  I'm getting a hooker.  And there was –  I'm sorry.  And there was a pool table up there.  That's what you say when you're sick.  Guys, I'm not going out.  I don't feel good.  Hooker. 
[02:27:30]  So I was in bed, and I could hear the pool balls knocking around upstairs.  And I'm like, oh, fucking Kenny and Happy must be back.  They're playing.  I could hear the balls rolling across the table and hitting each other.  And I just got really, really frightened.  And I went up, and I looked, and I was alone.  It's the only experience that I've ever had.  Fuck that.  But it was very, very fucking frightening.  And you saw Spooks or something.  Spooks.  That's what you should be afraid of.  Yeah, that's it. 
[02:28:00]  That was scary.  That was funny.  You felt scared before you went up there, though.  You felt – I just knew something was wrong.  Like, wait a minute.  Am I alone?  Are they not here?  It just hit me that I might be ill.  I was waking up, and I heard the noise.  It's a weird feeling because the same thing at this hotel.  Like, I've seen those little things happen.  But it's not enough to know it's a ghost, but it is unsettling.  Yeah, yeah.  It's just on that boundary of like, well, it could be something, but –  I talked loud.  Talking loud. 
[02:28:30]  What, are there ghosts here?  What are you, a fucking ghost?  Oh, that.  Leave me alone.  And the ghost –  Leave me alone.  You scared the ghost?  No, but it just takes – it's a time where you think you're supposed to be quiet and creepy.  So when you're louder, it feels like it takes you out of it.  Hey, what is this?  It's a ghost.  Right, right.  Make it all silly.  Wouldn't it ultimately, like, you know, seeing a ghost be not – I mean, I see why it's scary because I'm scared of it also.  But shouldn't it theoretically just be kind of awesome?  Like, wouldn't it be –  It should be, but it's so scary. 
[02:29:00]  Like, it – first of all, it confirms, like, what happens after death.  Hi, that might freak out a little bit.  And then it's like, you've always been conditioned to think these things are, like, fucked up and are there to fuck with you.  Somebody once called in – I did that Saturday night show and we talked about ghosts one night.  And the guy called in and he made so much sense.  He goes, so you believe when you die you turn into a ghost?  And that's what ghosts are, dead people?  I go, yeah.  He goes, yeah, well, there'd be ghost traffic if that was the case. 
[02:29:30]  Because there'd be so many ghosts.  And I'm like, yeah, why is there only, like, one ghost in each state?  Like, one – there'd be fucking ghosts right here, right now.  I was wondering about ghost clothes.  Like, they're always like, there she was wearing this silk gown and stuff.  It's like, what, do the clothes turn into a ghost?  Well, you know what's funny, too, is they never have a ghost from the 80s, like a black guy in roller skates.  You know, with a headband.  Old Civil War guy.  You know, just doing some disco moves in the corner. 
[02:30:00]  I like to not laugh.  With a big four-wheel roller skates.  On the disco ride.  Oh, yeah.  It wouldn't, like, graveyards be, like, concerts then.  It would just be packed.  Yeah.  Like a haunted mansion in Disney.  It's always old people from, like, old white people with white, like, freaky old clothes.  It's never –  Well, sometimes voodoo movies have black people.  That's the only time you get a black ghost is if there's voodoo involved.  Or a zombie, yeah.  Zombies a lot.  Santa Maria with some Spanish ones, right?  Santa Maria, right. 
[02:30:30]  That's creepy shit.  Yeah, there's no –  You're right.  It's usually crotchety old white people.  Yeah, there's no Indian ghosts.  You never –  No, there's spirits.  It's like the extension of Get Off My Lawn.  It's now there's still –  You had a good take on the whole Ghost Hunters and how, like, with all these shows on, we should see something.  And yet they've never shown any.  Well, you know, in a similar story, when I just flew in yesterday, I was on JetBlue and I was watching a thing about Bigfoot.  And it was like, this is the documentary.  That's going to prove that's it.  And I was like, if it proved there was Bigfoot, I would just know. 
[02:31:00]  You'd know already before it aired.  I would have found out from somebody, not this DirecTV on JetBlue.  And it goes on and on, and they tease it and tease it, and ultimately they have no answers.  Yeah.  I think that's interesting about the ghost hunting shows is that there's four of them on TV, and they all are really successful, and they all fail every week.  Yeah, they just –  And it's just like –  Well, one of them doesn't.  The show's a failure every week.  The show's proved that there's no such thing as going to happen.  No, wait.  One of them, Ghost Adventures, I think on –  That sounds like the least credible one.  Yeah, Ghost Adventures.  It's the best one because – 
[02:31:30]  Why?  Because most of these guys, these ghost shows, have a huge camera crew with them, okay?  So how creepy can you get with a sound guy and two camera guys with lights?  These guys go in, no crew, just those three.  They do all the filming with just handheld cameras in the dark with night vision camera, and they get locked in for the night.  It's not like they – like most of these shows, they go until three in the morning, and then they go, all right, let's wrap it up because they're tired.  So you're suggesting that the ghosts might be camera shy?  No. 
[02:32:00]  What I'm saying is that these guys are in the dark, complete darkness, and it's just them.  There's no camera crew, and they get locked in for the night until the sun comes up, and they've caught –  Is that what ends the night?  They've caught –  Shit.  Not in Alaska.  Stupid fuckhead.  I'm sorry.  That came out too mean.  Yeah, I know.  Sorry.  I just made a clever point about your –  I keep stressing for the night.  Dude, not till midnight.  Not till three for the night.  Until the sun comes up, in case you don't know what the night means and when it ends. 
[02:32:30]  I called them a fucking – I told you – I called you a fucking idiot at my house.  So I feel bad about that.  Don't be.  I'm not offended.  All right.  And these guys actually caught a brick going across, being thrown.  Like, that's pretty –  That's crazy.  I understand the urge to throw one.  For the night, dude.  He's just mean.  He's just attack mode all the time.  He's never – he's always on attack mode. 
[02:33:00]  No, I'm not.  Yeah, you are.  You're just mean to the core.  Have you ever seen that show Paranormal State?  It's like the dude's –  I watched that one too, yeah.  Well, I got contact on Twitter by that guy Chip Coffey.  What's that?  I know.  Oh, God.  I walked right into that one.  Listen, here's the thing, though.  I just want to – before you said this, Chip Coffey, they always have the psychic guy, and they're always gay.  Oh, really?  It's always a gay psychic.  Like, Chip Coffey, he walks in, he's like, oh.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, no.  Chip Coffey's the best. 
[02:33:30]  He's like, there's some evil shit in here.  So I have his, like – I have his home phone now.  I'm hoping to, like, get a reading with Chip Coffey.  Wow.  Chip Coffey is fucking hilarious.  He is.  But then they have the other chick, the lesbian girl.  Yeah.  Very serious.  Flat-faced.  Yeah.  Less interested in her.  Thin lips, yeah.  Chip comes in with a scarf.  Comes in with a scarf, throws it back.  Fashionable, huh?  I feel something's upstairs, and it's fucking hating everybody here.  Yeah, he's very sassy about his spiritual reality.  It's so funny, though, is he – 
[02:34:00]  I've not seen that.  He does prayers, like religious prayers.  Does he?  I've never noticed him do that.  Yeah, like Catholic prayers.  Well, I did an interview in our sort of press tour with a guy who writes for a paranormal,  I don't know, website or something.  And I was talking about Chip Coffey, and he was like, Chip's a very good friend of mine.  And I was like, oh, hook it up.  And next thing you know, now on Twitter.  And so I hope to – I had a friend who did a reading with him on her birthday.  Her, like, boyfriend got it for her.  And everything he said came true.  That's weird.  So I'm now fascinated to Chip Coffey.  Chip is – I fucking hate it. 
[02:34:30]  I just – I wish his name was Chip.  Jimmy's just sitting there with his eyes on.  Can we call him?  Yeah, Bob.  He's good.  But the Ghost Adventure guys – but this guy – one of the reasons why I like those guys,  he's a big, muscle, macho, alpha male guy.  And he walks out in the middle of the room, and he goes, come on, let's go.  Let's – you want to attack somebody, attack me.  Oh, he's that guy.  But in the Ghost Hunters, you're not supposed to provoke.  That's against the rules.  Is it?  Yeah, well, most ghosts, you don't provoke.  Who makes these rules up?  And they always run out of shit to say, too, when they provoke talking to the ghost. 
[02:35:00]  If you're here, could you tap on something?  It's like when a chick tells you to talk dirty and you just run out of shit.  Yeah.  Yeah, you fucking like that, don't you?  Yeah, you like that fucking shit.  Fucking you.  Yeah.  You like me fucking you.  Plow my cock in.  Like that.  Yeah.  You run out of shit.  And back in again, ad infinitum.  I think I'll give tonight as the last day that I make an attempt to believe in ghosts.  So if you come back and you say there's ghosts, I'll believe. 
[02:35:30]  I hope he doesn't come back.  Shut up!  Hang on.  A big moment is that Patrice joke that he used to have where he would say, like,  why are they always doing, like, hack movie ghost things?  Yeah, yeah, that's true.  He's always like, I now can't get that out of my head.  It makes total sense.  Yes.  Why aren't ghosts doing, like, regular just, like, shit?  It's always some hack ghosting shit.  They always creep behind the door.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're always like, you turn and look and nothing's there, and then you turn and  look in the mirror, and they're there.  It's like, come on, you fucking hack.  Why doesn't the ghost fucking just come out and start, like, fucking doing the music  from Escape from New York that Ernest Borgnine was listening to? 
[02:36:00]  Like, are you here?  That would be very original.  You never, like, open the bathroom door, and it's just like, get out, I'm on the shitter,  and there's just a ghost there.  It's never that.  You never see a ghost dropping a deuce.  Never.  What was the movie where the Barbara Hershey got sexually, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Her tit being mushed by a ghost.  Yeah, she's just getting raped by a ghost.  That's what ghosts should be doing. 
[02:36:30]  Ghost rape was fucking, I mean, I was sitting there going, why am I being turned on?  By ghost rape.  When you watch that movie, about 20 minutes in, you realize, like, oof, this is going  to keep happening, because there's nothing anyone can do about it, so she gets thrown  around the room and raped, and then you're like, they're just going to keep doing it.  They're going to keep raping that.  No one's going to stop them.  And they can just sit there and watch the investigation, like, they have no idea, I'm  right here.  Cops come in, you're like, ah, and they run out.  I would love to be a ghost rapist.  That would fucking rule.  Somehow I think that's how you're going to end up anyway.  Yeah, all I would do is just rape chicks. 
[02:37:00]  Rape.  It does seem like there would be some great things to do.  The body of Casper.  Yeah, well, you got the eyes.  That doesn't make any sense.  It just sucks.  It just stinks.  Chip ruins everything.  Even when you get a good one and you can't just laugh, because Chip will come in and just  smash it.  It just stinks.  I was listening the other day, I'm glad that Valley Jimmy has not taken off.  That is, I think, officially the worst one.  Yeah, I didn't like Valley Jimmy at all.  What is Valley Jimmy?  But he kept doing it.  It's Valley Jimmy.  It's Jimmy doing old fucking shtick from Valley Girl. 
[02:37:30]  He doesn't like to be gagged with utensils.  It's so fucking annoyingly bad.  I hope what happens to you, Anthony, I hope that you go there.  Well, I do too.  And you meet a ghost.  Yeah.  An older woman ghost.  Yeah.  That's mad at you because you're sleeping with younger, you have a younger girl on the  bed.  Why would the ghost give a shit?  I hope you get raped by an old lady ghost.  Why would the ghost care?  And why wouldn't the ghost just make herself young? 
[02:38:00]  Why do you have to be a certain age as a ghost?  That's stupid.  When you die, that's what you are as a ghost.  Not in Titanic, motherfucker.  What are you talking about?  She fucking died, the old broad, and then she went down to the Titanic, and there was  Leonardo DiCaprio waiting for the main stairway.  And they were both all young.  Did she die in Titanic?  Yeah.  What do you think?  No.  Did she jump off the boat at the end?  No.  I don't know.  She just kind of threw that diamond up the other guy.  That's right.  She threw the thing in.  Fucking stupid twat.  Then she went back to sleep, and she fucking, you know.  She just dreamed that she was in a boat.  Fucking some, some millionaire takes her on a trip, and she fucks a guy who is hitching 
[02:38:30]  a ride.  She fucking had forgotten about that.  I'll have to see it in 3D when it comes out now.  Well, yeah, yeah.  I got to see it in 3D.  Yeah, he's milking that franchise.  Of course, Lucas, thank God he's putting out another version of Star Wars in 3D.  That fucking makes me sick.  Starting with the best one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Starting with the best one.  The one with Jar Jar.  You like that.  Who told that fucking fat, weak-chinned idiot that that was a good character?  Jimmy makes fun of his chin.  This makes me laugh.  I know my chins. 
[02:39:00]  I don't hide it with a fucking beard like Dumbbell does.  Lucas has a terrible, yeah.  His nickname should be fucking Three Film McGillicuddy.  He is all neck.  You're right.  Yeah, yeah.  Enough with him.  Three Film McGillicuddy.  Enough with him.  It's a fucking franchise.  We get it.  It's, yeah, yeah.  A new concept.  I don't get the whole thing of bringing something to 3D when it's not made for 3D.  It wasn't shot for 3D.  Yeah, so you get a couple of scenes, you know, maybe, where it just happened to be coming  at the camera, but. 
[02:39:30]  No, he'll just redo it and keep adding shit and layering shit.  The only one that was good was Avatar.  That was the only 3D movie that I was like, this shit is pretty good.  I wasn't a big fan of the Avatar.  You see 3D version, though?  The 3D version was pretty amazing.  I saw it with the glasses.  Did you see it with the glasses?  I saw it with the glasses.  Were you on Long Island when you saw it with the glasses?  My eyes were going crazy.  It gave me a headache.  Yeah.  If you get, if I sue everyone.  If you're in your room at night and all of a sudden the light goes off, what would  you do?  Well, did someone turn it off?  No, it just goes off. 
[02:40:00]  What are you going to do?  I would assume that.  Do you mean it starts yelling and talking shit?  Goes off?  I would assume the bulb burnt out.  Blew a fuse.  Hang on one second.  What did you say, Jim?  I was wondering if when you said the light goes off, do you mean that it was just talking  a lot of shit, like bashing you?  Oh, God.  That's...  At least use the chip voice if you're going to lay down humor such as that.  Nudge yourself, stupid.  I would probably get startled for a second, but that wouldn't be like one of those ghostly  moments where I would freak out.  What if you heard somebody whisper in your ear? 
[02:40:30]  Why are you in my bed?  Is it a real person, or there's no one there?  Do you know how many times you've heard that, but instead of bed, they say crib.  Shit, man.  I also have no doubt that tonight...  No one's on fire today.  He's on fire.  The town has certainly seen better days, so I have no doubt that the fact that there's  going to be all these people in a one block radius, everyone who has some scam is going  to be out tonight.  So I'm very curious to see how everyone's going to be trying to make a few bucks.  Yeah.  Get your ghost pictures here.  Get your ghost pictures. 
[02:41:00]  Get your amulets to protect you from the hauntings.  I'm going to buy one.  Here's your elixirs.  Drink your elixir before you see the haunted movie.  Yeah.  I saw a ghost.  There'll be one guy telling ghost stories, and nobody'll give a fuck shit.  Holy water.  I get your holy water.  Yeah.  You think?  Just to praise some fat...  I have holy water and crucifixes.  The guy in the business next door trying to alert, like, the real ghosts are over here.  Don't listen to that shit.  Oh, yeah.  Trying to draw the business away from the peddler. 
[02:41:30]  All hotels say they're haunted, but this is a haunted dry cleaner.  That's crazy.  Do you know where the most hauntedest is?  Yes.  How do you say that?  I do.  Most haunted.  Haunted place.  There are.  There's two spots.  One of which is when, in my movie, the most haunted room in the story is the honeymoon suite.  And it just is because it's about a woman who killed herself on her wedding day.  And we shot it in this room only because...  Was her name Bonnie? 
[02:42:00]  I only picked the room because it was on the third floor at the end of a hallway, and it was big enough to do a dolly shot.  So it was just technical reasons so I could film it the way I wanted to.  And then when we wrapped shooting, I found out that that room is actually the most haunted room in the hotel.  Really?  So it's a coincidence that I picked that room.  But when you add all those other things up, like the doors and whatever, it's weird.  And then they say the basement is pretty haunted as well.  Would you stay in the basement?  No!  That's what you want to do.  Why don't you go in the basement?  I'll walk down there.  You should stay in the basement.  Other people go.  You should stay in the fucking basement.  No!  Why would I do that? 
[02:42:30]  This is what you do.  You go to the basement, have everybody leave.  Until dawn.  Hang out there for a couple...  Until dawn.  When the sun comes up.  Hang out there for a couple...  The whole night!  Film it.  The night.  The night.  You stay for the night, dude.  Well, I got that.  You should film it.  My iPhone.  From the dusk.  Take through the night.  You come down, find you drinking, throwing bricks everywhere.  Yeah, the ghosts are all hanging out.  Fucking dropping N-bombs.  Because they're all from the 1800s.  What do you mean they let those people vote now, Anthony?  He's like, I know! 
[02:43:00]  Are you saying I would have a good time hanging out with those ghosts?  Yeah, the ghosts from the 1800s would tell you you're too conservative.  Dude, you've got to lighten up a little bit.  You think we're scary.  It's easy.  No.  A little heavy-handed, aren't you, Tony?  I think with all the cameras that everybody has, it's like UFOs, you know?  All the cameras.  You'd get UFOs and ghosts and Bigfoot if they existed.  But they have some...  I mean, I've seen some stuff on YouTube.  I'm not saying I don't know what the fuck it is. 
[02:43:30]  But there's some stuff on YouTube that you're like, whoa, that's fucking...  That's pretty weird.  How about definitive proof of a ghost?  Not a fucking lens flare or something?  I've seen some creepy shit on...  I mean, that show Ghost Adventures.  I mean, there's a brick.  Flies across the room and a piece of wood.  But it goes up and over.  It's not like it's falling down.  Which you could be, oh, that fell off or something.  It gets up and over, which is...  Almost like it was on a string.  Yeah, almost.  They had it on the news then. 
[02:44:00]  They had...  They found ghosts throwing bricks.  All of a sudden, where were they?  Were they in Watts in 1968?  They were on the news.  It was on the local news for the show.  All of them were hitting Reginald Denny's head.  Yeah.  It was a ghost that threw a toilet at a trucker.  You guys didn't lock his doors on the get-off.  Go ahead, mock the ghosts.  I'm not mocking the ghosts.  You are mocking the ghosts.  No, I'm not.  Ghosts are cunts.  Anthony is mocking the ghosts.  Also, watching that Bigfoot show, like the famous Bigfoot,  footage, I don't like how he just saunters away.  Like, there's two guys with guns on horses that are humans  to this giant creature, and it's just like... 
[02:44:30]  And it has that swagger to its wall.  Yeah, that little swagger.  He walks away.  And, yeah, it's like back in the 70s.  They would have shot him.  They would have shot him, those old fucking codgers.  And ate him.  I was watching a series of them on the History Channel.  It was that, and there was Champ.  They would have sold his pelt.  Oh, yeah.  This is like the Loctis monster of Lake Champlain.  Yeah, that's not true.  Nessie is not real, although there's been some amazing...  But the surgeon's photo, which was the most famous photo of Nessie,  was what he said on his deathbed was a hoax,  and he said how he did it.  Yeah, when you get a bunch of... 
[02:45:00]  It was his cock, right?  Yeah, that was it.  It was on his back.  He bent his dick.  A weird piece of wood that was upside down.  It was something that just looked...  The shadow of it looked...  Look up Nessie.  Yeah.  What is it?  The surgeon's photo.  What is it?  Nessie.  Nessie.  Was that taking it in the day or the night?  Yeah, it was at dusk, probably.  Or it was black and white.  It's hard to tell.  What's weird, though, is there's not much difference between, like,  if Nessie was real and, like, a crocodile.  Like, if you had never seen a crocodile before,  it'd be the craziest monster you'd ever seen.  We just got used to it, so... 
[02:45:30]  They're dinosaurs.  But, I mean, I'm sure somewhere in, like, the Congo or the Amazon,  like, way in there where no one can go,  there's got to be some weird things that we don't know about.  Like, you actually walk into a piano bar in Scotland  and you see the Loch Ness Monster,  but everybody there is just used to it.  He's just...  Why would he be in a piano bar?  That's the odd part,  and he's just dumping water on himself because he hates being dry.  This is work.  The waitresses hate him.  His area's always sloppy and wet.  More water, yeah.  He doesn't tip because he has no pockets.  He's just a monster.  Yes. 
[02:46:00]  Get it in.  Tinkles on the floor.  So, I think with all the cameras that everybody has now...  Now, years ago, we got a bunch of UFO photos,  and the odds that you were going to see one  and have a camera on you were astronomical.  And they still found places where there were these UFOs.  Now, anything that happens of any significance,  there's fucking video of it somewhere.  But there are stuff...  How come there's no UFOs?  There are some fucking clusters and weird stuff I've seen.  Oh, those fucking pin lights that no one could see what they are.  No, there are some of them that do move in a weird... 
[02:46:30]  When they report it from a bunch of different areas at once,  then I tend to have...  I'm sure that the UFO we do,  they're not going to have the Jetson sound.  I want to see that.  I want to see a whole fucking...  Was that Steve's Prius?  Yeah.  That's right.  When pilots report them, I find them more credible.  Yeah.  Pilots...  Yes.  They have an entire series.  They have one in a volcano.  This volcano erupted,  and they have a photo of a ship inside of the blast.  That's that evil. 
[02:47:00]  Inside of the blast, like lights.  And it's like, what the fuck?  Where's this photo?  It's on the internet.  Can you Google it?  Uh...  You're lying.  I swear to God, it was just on...  They did a whole show on it, in UFOs,  and it was...  Yeah, that was...  That fucking creeps me out.  You see...  I mean, a volcano's erupting,  and there's actually lights inside of the volcano,  like a ship.  The craziest thing is Betty and Barney Hill.  Ship.  I said ship, not ship.  Betty and Barney Hill is probably one of the most outrageous  fucking things that ever happened.  Fucking black and white couple back in the 60s.  It's crazy. 
[02:47:30]  Interracial couple that was taken aboard...  Oh, they were?  Time, a ship.  And they said that they...  They were a fairly believable case,  because they came out of hypnosis.  Both of them, I think, had to be hypnotized.  And she was describing a needle-in-the-stomach test  that they were giving her,  and they said that...  Maybe his dick had hurt her lower abdomen.  And she said it was a...  They said that we're checking to see if you're pregnant, 
[02:48:00]  but it was a pregnancy test that wasn't done.  Medicine hadn't invented that yet.  So, again, it may be nothing.  I don't know.  Probably bullshit.  Was her father making sure there weren't any problems?  It was probably Betty and Barney Hill  probably just hiding from fucking...  Oh, look at that.  From life.  What is that?  Oh, my God.  What was the guy's name that they made  that Fire in the Sky movie about?  Oh, right, yeah.  The logger guy.  Travis.  Wait.  No.  Acta Gay?  No, no.  Acta Gay!  Oh, my God.  Is it...  Let me see. 
[02:48:30]  Walton?  Travis Walton?  Travis Walton, yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Tostito.  Travis Bickle.  Shut up.  By the way, that's just a fucking flare  on the camera lens, Bob.  I'm looking at that terrible video.  Who put it out, J.J. Abrams?  It really isn't.  There's nothing UFO-ish about it.  Are you reading the comments?  He loves a lens flare.  That's not it.  Good, I hope not,  because that was a dud.  You a fan of the lens flare, Ty?  Not at...  Well, at times.  I feel like it's maybe...  I think J.J. Abrams, you know,  I think he's retired it. 
[02:49:00]  Oh, really?  I think he's done two in a row  with every lens flare you could have.  Every single one.  I like the nice blue one  that goes across the whole screen.  Yeah, those are those  anamorphic lens ones.  Yeah, anamorphic.  Why does he use that?  And then I like the big round red ones  that then leave the little bubbles  that kind of move around.  I believe those are from  the spherical lenses.  Yes, very good.  Oh, yes.  What's a really good camera  to use to shoot something  relatively inexpensively  that looks really good?  The 5D's good?  Yeah, the 5 and the 7D are good,  and they probably have a new one now.  I thought the 5D's better than the 7D.  I've heard that, too. 
[02:49:30]  Someone will probably correct me,  but I believe that the 5D...  7D, I think, can shoot 24p,  whereas the 5D, I think,  only shoots 2997,  so it, I think,  has a little bit better of a time.  It's just different frame rates.  Remember how, like...  Remember how forever you're always like,  why do soap operas  look different than movies?  Yeah.  It's because they were shot on video,  which is shot at 2997,  and film is shot at 24 frames per second.  So there's sort of a different...  Or if you see, like, British TV,  that's shot at 25 frames,  which is pow,  and it always looks a little different.  What's better? 
[02:50:00]  There is not a better.  People generally prefer 24 frames  because we're more accustomed to it.  So 7D does 24, I think, better.  People always want their videos  to have a film look to them, you know?  Yeah.  We just become...  2997 for us has been,  like, we've just associated with video  for so long.  So 24 helps with that.  But I think those cameras are good.  But now I think you can even rent Reds  and Alexas for really cheap now.  But you need...  Is a Red really good?  The resolution is really high. 
[02:50:30]  It's more complicated.  Like, you can take a Canon 7D  and to some degree point and shoot with it  with your Red.  Yeah, but you can only run those  for 12 minutes at a time.  You can only do a video for 12 minutes.  Really?  You only have to shut it off  and turn it right back on.  Why?  Because it's not made to run  for, like, an hour straight.  It will heat up.  It gets too hot so you...  Theoretically, an AC would be  swapping batteries.  Yeah, that's why the cameras are bigger  because they cool off.  They have all kinds of shit in there  to keep...  But the 5D and the 7D,  around 12 minutes,  you have to shut it down. 
[02:51:00]  Whoa.  5 and 7D?  You just have to hit on and off.  Off and on, I mean.  And then that's it.  Really?  Yeah.  Not with the Red, you don't know.  Because I'm thinking he's showing my...  As he was saying that,  he was doing the exact same motions  in the video.  Oh, wow.  That's ghostly.  It was.  It was a haunted connection there.  What if you looked on here  and it was actually me?  And I was a ghost.  We'd be much happier.  You would have made that, dude.  Oh.  Yeah.  That's just terrible.  I wish Bob was a ghost.  Why is he waving to the ghost?  Dude, what's wrong?  Why would you say that? 
[02:51:30]  This could be fun to see you  trying to haunt the place  and everyone going,  shut up.  Whoa, whoa, dude.  How would I...  No, it would be like this.  Dude.  You know what, dude?  Dude.  Yeah.  Dude.  Boom.  You got your afterlife.  You got your haunting.  Boom, dude.  Dude.  I saw a ghost.  His leg was broken.  He was bitching about it.  Dude.  The ITV's coming out.  I'm missing it.  I walked through a wall, dude.  Dude, the ITV.  I snapped my misty knee, dude. 
[02:52:00]  My misty knee?  Yeah.  Well, I picked up a couple  of those GoPro cameras  and that 3D thing.  It's hilarious.  I just kind of went around  my house yesterday  and then converted it to 3D,  put on the dopey glasses.  It looks pretty cool.  Yeah, it's fucking fun.  It gives it some depth.  It was like, you know,  flying around the house.  Those GoPro cameras,  like a couple hundred bucks.  They work great, right?  Yeah, and they come  in the waterproof case.  I'm going to take it  on the cruise with me  and we'll do it  when we swim around  with them dolphins.  Oh, right.  Put that on.  I have one of those cameras.  Well, you should attach it 
[02:52:30]  to the dolphin.  You know you can do that.  Oh, how about that?  You don't have to ask.  You just grab the camera  and strap it to its fucking nose.  Strap it?  How about I just put  a dart on it  and stick it in?  Stick it right in its hole?  Yeah, right in a blowhole  in the fucking eye  or something.  What?  You watch it bleed.  Do you ever get  one of those still cameras,  those lenticular ones  that you take the photos with  and then you mail it away  and they mail you back  the lenticular holograms.  Oh, right, right.  What does lenticular mean?  You know those  sometimes they're on book covers  or DVD covers  where it's like  you kind of do this 
[02:53:00]  and it looks three-dimensional?  Oh, when you move it  back and forth.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it's got depth to it.  There's cameras you can buy.  It's the kind of thing  you get at Urban Outfitters  or something like that  at the register  and you're like,  all right.  And yeah,  you mail it away  and they mail you back  all of them.  They work pretty well.  Wow, I didn't even know those.  It's fun one time  and then you're like,  Yeah, then you just,  ah, what am I going to do?  It's like 3D.  I mean, your camera,  you'd use it once.  It's like night vision.  You use it once  to get a blowjob  and you see the veins  in her fucking vagina.  You see the veins  feeding her pussy up,  going up her thigh.  You're like,  I'm fucking out 
[02:53:30]  and I'm tapping out.  Ah, shit.  No, I'm going to do  the compound podcast  in 3D.  I'm going to do  a whole show in 3D.  Why do you have to ask?  Because I'm just going to sit there  and throw a rolled up paper at it  and fucking, you know.  Do we have to have glasses  to watch your show now?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're going to need  like the 3D glasses.  Are you going to get  Anthony compound 3D glasses?  No, you've got to  fucking find them yourself.  They're all over.  There's no problem  getting 3D glasses.  So we're going to have  to go see a kids movie  just to watch your fucking show?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You need to brand them.  You could have swastikas 
[02:54:00]  on both ends.  I really get swastikas.  Jesus.  That's a nice Nazi.  Yeah, I'll have swastikas  coming at you.  Well, you're a fan of the era.  That's all it is.  I'm a fan of the era.  It was not, you know,  any ideology.  I hope you get possessed  by a black ghost tonight.  Look at you.  I have a black  and he comes in black.  Like you did when you were a kid.  Yeah.  Only it wasn't a ghost.  Yeah, it was a gardener.  Someone's a gardener.  I think I was a...  My family was a millionaire?  No.  I don't think your family  was a millionaire.  I just think your gardener  raped your asshole.  I didn't say he was employed  by your family. 
[02:54:30]  He probably just wandered  into your fucking  broken screen door.  How'd you know  I had a broken screen door?  Because you look molestible  and everyone who was molested  had a broken screen door.  Oh, really?  That's true.  I'll go to raping you  to fix it.  I didn't know that.  I really hope you get  fucking possessed.  I don't want to get possessed.  It's going to happen.  I don't want to see a ghost.  I don't want to fucking...  I just want to...  You do want to see a ghost.  I want to party.  I actually...  It's going to be a party.  It's going to fucking be a party.  It should be a good time.  Ghosts don't like parties.  They do.  They do like parties.  It scares them away like fish.  They do like them.  And then late at night...  They don't like fish to get scared. 
[02:55:00]  This is what's going to happen.  When it's all said and done,  you go back to your...  Later at night,  you're going to be in your bed  by yourself.  For the night.  And that's...  I like it.  Stay for the night.  And that's when it's going to happen.  Yeah.  I hope the ghost shows up at dawn  just to prove the theory wrong.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, Bobby.  What the fuck?  The 4 p.m. ghost.  How come there's no ghosts  at fucking...  in the daytime?  Ever?  Oh.  Yeah, ever.  In every movie,  there's no ghosts  that attacks during the day. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah, it wouldn't be as scary.  How come ghosts don't just show up  where there's a lot of people?  Like, how come they never show up  at a flash mob  and haunt,  like, when someone's grabbing  a Butterfingers?  Yeah.  Some weird place.  Tokyo could be the most haunted place  that, like, Times Square...  Yeah, they're all packed in.  Times Square, right.  Ghost in Times Square.  No.  It's always some fucking  half-abandoned house.  No one there.  What a load of shit.  You know what was the scary movie  was that one with John Cusack,  who I don't like?  Oh.  Room 1.  Oh, the ghost is making me go.  14...  1408. 
[02:56:00]  That was scary.  Maybe, because then all of a sudden  you can't leave the room.  Like, that was fucking horrifying.  The short story of that  is actually really...  I wasn't a huge fan of the movie  because it turns into the weird,  like, the painting.  It just kind of goes overboard.  Yeah, yeah.  But the story,  there's this thing that keeps happening  where the phone keeps ringing  and the person on the other line  is just like,  number nine,  number nine,  and then he hangs up  and they just keep calling  and counting down  and that's...  Oh, that's pretty funny.  It's really creepy.  Number nine for what?  But it's just some weird  Stephen King stuff.  That's what people keep saying  on the phone  and they keep counting down numbers.  Yeah.  It's really creepy. 
[02:56:30]  When you're reading it at home,  you get really creepy.  Before it went overboard,  that was a really creepy movie.  And I liked the initial exchange, too,  between him and...  Who was running the hotel?  Samuel Jackson.  Samuel Jackson.  Yeah, that was funny.  I was in...  I was in...  What the fuck?  Louisville.  And they put you  in this old, old hotel.  Really,  they have Al Capone room  in this restaurant  called the Oak Room.  He had his own...  Did they think he'd come back  when you walked in?  Well, they...  I want him dead. 
[02:57:00]  I want his family dead.  And I went up to the 10th floor  and they said  that's where this lady  in a blue dress  jumped through  in the elevator shaft,  killed herself  because her husband  or something happened.  Her husband got in a car accident  and she was supposed to die.  He didn't die.  It was just a fuck-up.  He actually just...  Oh, boy.  He got hurt real bad  and then she just said  fuck it  and killed herself.  I went up to the 10th floor  by myself  and I got  fucking goose pimples. 
[02:57:30]  Were you that all scared?  Yeah, but I don't know  if that was my own...  Of course it was.  Yes, it was.  We know.  It was your own.  Of course it was.  What else is it?  What else is it?  Electricity.  They use electricity.  There was no ghost lady.  Ghost lady in a blue dress.  Ghost lady jumping in a blue dress.  Bitch.  I hope you both get haunted.  No.  It would make me so happy.  Ghosts are queers.  I don't want to get haunted.  You think that?  Oh, please let it happen.  A ghost wouldn't even have to change his form  to possess him. 
[02:58:00]  Yeah?  Maybe he'd fall in your mouth or something.  What?  Goddamn, Chip's.  It's like, you know,  you get a good one in  and Chip's got to just step on it.  Damn, man.  He's a fucking party pooper.  Unbelievable.  And it's not Chip, by the way.  Who is it?  Peppy Sinclair.  Yeah, he's calling himself Peppy Sinclair now.  I refuse.  I don't even know where this fucking came from.  I refuse.  What a name.  Peppy Sinclair.  This is more show busy.  And Chip.  Stage name.  Can I get an agent?  Peppy Sinclair.  So, um...  Yeah, so, uh...  So, tonight is your movie premiere. 
[02:58:30]  The movie's out already,  so if you're listening to this  and you want to see the movie,  you can go see it.  But, yeah, tonight specifically  is this Torrington premiere.  Where can I go see it?  In New York?  New East.  No shit.  Oh, that sounds good.  I'm going to go check it out this weekend.  Yeah, you should definitely check it out.  And it's scary, though.  It's fucking scary.  I mean, it's relatively lighthearted  for the first half,  because it's about these nerds  that work at this haunted hotel  that's going out of business.  Are you in it?  I'm not in it.  Okay.  Not to say...  I didn't mean to...  I'm not like...  Like, what?  What are you implying?  Well, he said nerds,  and I go, you're in it immediately.  I was like, I didn't want to say that. 
[02:59:00]  I wasn't saying that.  No, I'm not.  Sarah Paxton is the lead,  and Pat Healy is the lead,  and it's these two...  That's great.  They're kind of doing this  low-budget ghost hunting,  and they get in over their heads.  That's great.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's...  So far, so good.  I'm looking forward to it.  I actually like when they fucking do...  I just watched one the other night  about ghost hunters.  This lady,  and...  I forget what the fuck it was called.  I think it was called  The Death of a Ghost Hunter.  It was kind of cheesy.  To the point, yeah.  It was...  But there's...  Spoiler in the title. 
[02:59:30]  The actress in it  was fucking so horrific.  I kind of like it.  It's just she'd come in  and deliver her lines  with just the emotion.  Like, she'd come in  and be like, happy.  Hi, how are you?  Yes.  And then she'd be angry.  Why would you do that?  I would make the face  that goes along with it.  I was watching Ed Wood  a couple of weeks ago,  and then I decided to just watch,  because I hadn't seen it in a while,  Plan 9.  From Outer Space.  And the original movie  is better than the goof 
[03:00:00]  that they did in Ed Wood.  It's just...  It's so horrifically bad.  And everyone knows,  you know, the sets and everything,  but the acting.  I love the cop.  The cops are my favorite part,  because the guy is supposed  to be a detective,  and he's got his six gun  down by his hip,  and he's waving it around,  like, just pointing at his guys.  All right, you.  Take off over there  and look over that way.  And he's using the barrel  of his gun as a pointer.  And then one of the cops goes,  hey, wait a minute,  and scratches his head  with the barrel of his gun. 
[03:00:30]  He adjusts the brim of his hat.  They're just using these guns.  These cops,  no real gun safety.  Nothing authentic.  Going on there, yeah.  And then a scene  where a guy's supposed  to be getting into a car,  and it's supposed to be night,  but all it is  is a tarp behind the car.  Oh, God, really?  And you can see wrinkles  in the tarp.  It's just so bad.  But he thought that was  his Citizen Kane.  Oh, that was the best one.  Even after I was reading  all about it,  he ended up making pornos  and stuff,  like just horrible stuff,  and he always said  that that was his movie.  This is the one  they'll remember me for. 
[03:01:00]  I always hear in Ed Wood  that one line  that always comes up  in conversations  is that Mexico  was a nightmare.  Anytime anyone says,  it's sort of like Chip,  anytime anyone says Mexico,  it's like,  Mexico was a nightmare.  I haven't seen that in years.  I want to see it again.  It's a really bold movie  that they let him make.  I mean, it's like,  Tim Burton after Batman  could do whatever he wanted,  so he made this black and white  Ed Wood movie  with Johnny Depp.  I mean, it's like,  no one would ever  let him do that now. 
[03:01:30]  Eddie, I don't feel good, Eddie.  Mark Landau was so good.  Landau was great.  Didn't he win Oscar?  Yeah, sure.  He did.  He got a nod, as we say.  Ah, yeah.  I saw him at a coffee bean  in L.A.  right before he won that.  Did you say hi, home?  No, I was panicked.  I panicked when I see famous people.  So, weren't you in space 1999?  Remember that?  With the fucking shitty little models  at the beginning?  It was terrible.  It's not really a famous person,  but at my hotel last night,  do you guys know who Tim Ferriss is?  He wrote a book called  The 4-Hour Workweek  and The 4-Hour Body. 
[03:02:00]  He's doing this book  called The 4-Hour Chef right now.  No, he loves 4 hours.  He was checking into the hotel  at the same time,  and I was like,  I felt compelled for the first time.  I was like,  dude, I really like you.  I was like,  I give your books to people  for Christmas  and things like that.  He was very nice.  And you recognized him?  Yeah.  Despite this room not knowing him,  he's relatively popular.  He's one of the first guys  I think to invest in Twitter,  and he's kind of a dot-com guy  that wrote this book  called The 4-Hour Workweek  about how to manage your time better,  and it became a bestseller, 
[03:02:30]  and then he wrote The 4-Hour Body  about diet and fitness  and things like that.  And he's really into  self-experimentation.  He's a really interesting guy.  His books are great.  He'd be a good guy on the show  because he'll fly to Africa  to get weird stem cells  implanted in him  that you can't do here  and things like that.  And he gets glucose monitors  implanted in his side  to see how food affects him differently.  And he goes and trains  with powerlifters  to see what the minimum amount  of working out you can do  to put on the most amount of muscle.  Does it work for him?  He's in massively good shape.  But he learned to run a marathon 
[03:03:00]  in three weeks  or something like that  by learning...  That's always supposed to take  a couple hours, though.  That's a terrible time.  Oh, sorry.  It was his first one.  It was very long.  But yeah,  I do recommend his books.  I think they'll be interested in him.  I hear you sometimes  talk about not eating carbs  and there's a big thing  about his thing.  He calls it the slow carb diet,  but it's about not eating  refined carbohydrates  and things like that.  I went into a weird  biochemical chemistry phase  about a year ago  and read all these books  about biochemistry  and nutrition. 
[03:03:30]  And his book is...  It's not...  His isn't really science-driven.  It's more of a lifestyle version,  but that's how I came across it.  What's the four-hour thing about?  It's about doing things  in a limited amount of time.  It's about...  A four-hour work week  is about...  Instead of just constantly  refreshing your email all day,  you set aside a certain amount  of time that you do email  and you actually find yourself  to be more productive.  Oh, but you've got to  check it all the time.  Yeah, that's his thing.  His life was getting ruined  because he was working  24 hours a day.  Is he OCD?  Not really.  He's a strange guy,  but he's... 
[03:04:00]  It's like he's weirdly  self-competitive in a way,  so he's trying to maximize  his efficiency at all times.  I mean, he's a weird dude.  What's his name?  Tim Ferriss.  Tim Ferriss.  Does he cook in the shower  like Kramer?  Well, his new book  is called...  Efficiency plan?  It's possible  because his new book  is called The Four-Hour Chef.  Oh, maybe he's...  That's what he's in town  working on.  Made it in the shower?  Yeah, it's interesting.  There's a lot of good tips  about diet and fitness,  about if you're trying  to lose weight,  one way to help  is if you put an ice pack  on your chest  or the top of your back. 
[03:04:30]  It stimulates hormones  that speed up  your resting metabolic rate  and things like that.  Holy shit.  A lot of stuff like that,  he did all these experiments.  While you're working out,  you do that?  No, you just do it  while you're watching TV  or something for a half hour.  Put ice on your fucking body  and you can become skinny?  Yeah, or you can take  a cold shower  because what it does is  your body has to work  to bring your temperature  back up.  So when you're just sitting there,  you're resting  at a metabolic rate,  you burn more fat  because your body's  trying to bring yourself  up to a normal temperature.  And also,  in this area  on the top of your chest,  there's some sort  of hormone stimulation  that causes you 
[03:05:00]  to burn more fat.  It's pretty interesting.  God, I'd love to lose,  not be a fatty  and just put ice cubes  on my chest  while I'm watching TV  playing Xbox or something.  I don't know.  If I had more time,  it would be more time  to not do anything.  How much more time  would you need?  How much more time  do you work four hours a day?  Hey, look.  And then you go home.  I have to commute.  I don't hand  to the devil's playground.  Exactly.  Oh, my goodness.  What the fuck?  I hate you. 
[03:05:30]  I hate you,  the person that invented  all these people.  That's who I hate.  Not the people.  I hate you now, Jim.  Fuck.  I can't stand them.  Yeah.  Well, you need to stop  hating everything  and just start liking you.  I got reads to do  and we have plugs to do.  Yes.  I'm going to be  at Gotham Comedy Club.  Gotham,  you're doing a live podcast.  Live podcast.  You know what, dude?  Named by Jimmy.

How was Sundance?  You went there, right?  It was good. 
[03:07:00]  I have another movie there  called VHS.  It's like an anthology movie.  We had people panic.  Like we had two people  pass out in the theater  and then start puking  all over the place.  What the fuck was that about?  I'd love to say  I'd love to say that we scared them  so much  but I think it was  the altitude sickness.  But yeah,  this guy got up  and he had to run out  of the theater  and when he got to the lobby  he just ate it on the floor  and then his girlfriend  came out in panic  and started throwing up  on his back.  Paramedics.  Holy shit.  It was great press for us  but it was quite the scene.  Jesus Christ.  That's funny.  And you're going to be  haunted tonight. 
[03:07:30]  Yeah, I'm going tonight.  I'm going to check it out.  So you'll have stories tomorrow.  The Yankee peddler.  And yeah,  well,  hopefully I just have  a nice story  of a nice party.  I hope you wake up tomorrow  with three scratches  in your back.  The Scratches of the Trinity  as they call it.  What the fuck is that?  That's what they call it.  It is not.  That's what they call it.  They do.  They call it the Trinity.  Oh, please.  You have the scale  of the Trinity.  See, 300.  Oh, wow.  Or something.  You have scales  like a snake or something.
