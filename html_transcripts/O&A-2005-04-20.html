<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, expressing considerable frustration with XM Satellite Radio's management. They detailed ongoing issues, including unpaid bills for their road manager, "Club Soda Kenny,"  leading to their decision to cease all future road trips until these logistical and financial problems were resolved.  They also referenced previous studio setup problems (now fixed) and declared their refusal to attend any further meetings to address their concerns.

This transitioned into a lengthy and sexually explicit segment focused on their intern, Ricky. The hosts relentlessly mocked Ricky’s perceived lack of sexual experience, discussing his dating history (including a relationship with a 16-year-old), infrequent masturbation, awkwardness, and fashion sense (described as all-brown clothing and unusually long fingernails).  Doug created a humorous theme song for Ricky.  A portion of Ricky's own radio show was played, highlighting his on-air persona.  The hosts also assigned Ricky a "school project": confronting a verbally aggressive, overweight female coworker and recording the interaction.

The conversation then shifted to the election of Pope Benedict XVI, with Opie and Anthony launching into a series of offensive jokes targeting the Pope's age, alleged Nazi past, and conservative views.  This included playing a Stephen Lynch song about masturbation and discussing their "Whip’em Out Wednesday" segment.  Listener calls and audio clips related to the Pope's election were incorporated, alongside humorous and offensive commentary on various news events, other media personalities (particularly John Sterling’s Yankee game calls), and their own experiences.

A rambling discussion followed about human intelligence and our place in the animal kingdom, featuring frequent guest Jimmy Norton. Speculation ranged from humans being aliens or the result of an alien experiment to comparing our intelligence to other animals. This included tangents about a radio DJ reprimanded for gorilla jokes, the disappearance of frogs, and the lack of animal participation in human activities.  A caller noted that Google's "I'm Feeling Lucky" search for "Failure" yielded George Bush's biography. Opie discussed his past anger issues and his improved mood at XM. Another caller argued humans weren't the smartest creatures due to our reliance on technology, prompting a debate between Opie and Anthony. The Hindenburg disaster and its radio broadcast were also referenced.  The segment included a creative mix of the bells from St. Peter's Basilica and AC/DC's "Hells Bells," and listener calls, one of which included a joke about a "nigger in a fish tank," and discussion of a stunt at a cruise ship press conference involving "Opie and Anthony Wow" signs.  The hosts also interacted with their production staff, Derek and Nathaniel.

The show continued with a discussion of a previous incident where they disrupted a news report about the Norwegian Dawn cruise ship, yelling "Opie and Anthony" and other exclamations. They discussed the unedited online video of the incident and their growing notoriety in New York media. Speculation followed about the ship sailing through a storm possibly due to pressure to meet a filming date for Donald Trump's *The Apprentice*. A Wisconsin caller, Chris, expressed his newfound enjoyment of the show.

Further segments included discussions of scheduling changes, recording intros for "best of" bits, and a meta-discussion about "breaking the fourth wall." Pre-recorded comedic bits, including one about Jim Norton hiring an older escort and another involving "Stalker Patty," were played. A surprising guest appearance by Sean Hannity followed, where they discussed the new Pope, the Catholic Church sex abuse scandal, and Hannity's views.  A call from James in Wyoming, and a lengthy discussion with Rocco, a chef and former reality TV personality,  dominated a significant portion of the show. Rocco discussed his reality TV experiences, his current radio show, his restaurant career, including the sale of Union Pacific, his appearance in *People*'s "sexiest men" issue, his book and TV show, and his radio show, "Food Talk with Rocco," on WR 710 AM.  He also jokingly claimed sexual abstinence.

The show concluded with a discussion about New York City restaurants, featuring Rocco’s insights and covering various high-end establishments like Balthazar, La Bernadette, Cafe Ballou, Ginza Sushi Co., and Il Molino. The segment returned to the hosts’ frustrations with XM Satellite Radio over proposed commercials for their show, particularly their objections to the repeated mention of "channel blocking."  They criticized the commercials for downplaying the show's value and showcasing corporate embarrassment, ultimately rejecting the scripts.  The broadcast ended with a discussion of a 911 call with poor communication, highlighting their frustrations with the XM situation and reflecting on the growth of satellite radio and the need for more competent personnel.

[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you.

[00:02:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Do you think I'm cute, Private Pound?  Do you think I'm funny?  Well, no shit.  That one gets me every time.  Oh, shit. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, man, what a day in New York City.  It's already 70 degrees.  Beautiful.  I know, I know.  It's a national talk show, and someone somewhere is saying,  70 degrees, who cares?  Right.  We care, though.  Oh, we care a lot.  And it's all about us.  It's going to get up to 90 today.  Really?  Yeah, that's what they're saying.  90 today, and then back down to 60 tomorrow.  Do you have any inane, stupid, useless things to do here today after the show? 
[00:04:00]  Yeah, we've got to talk to Rolling Stone magazine.  Yeah.  Because that's what failures do, by the way.  Who, who?  Now I'm going to point out all the cool stuff we get to do, because all our critics out  there have to say that we're failing for some reason.  Yeah, Rolling Stone's talking to us today, and then we're doing some TV spots or something.  Really?  We've got to read that.  Yeah, audio for TV spots, I guess, after the show today.  Oh, that's right.  We were supposed to get scripts, weren't we?  Yeah, we're the scripts. 
[00:04:30]  We kind of wung it last time.  We winged it.  We winged it at it.  We just went into the studio and decided, we know what our show's about, and we, I think  we know best how to spend 10 seconds for a commercial spot to describe what our show's  about.  So we went into the studio for about a half hour, laid down some tracks, as they say in  the biz, hope, the tracks, and left.  Then we were wondering where the commercials were.  Well, apparently it went to XM, and somebody at XM, it's just XM, there's no real people, 
[00:05:00]  it's just XM said, no.  Well, they were not acceptable.  So now we have to do it again today, but we were given a little guidance, I guess, a  script, if you will, that we're supposed to use as a reference, an outline, to what  we're supposed to say for these 10-second commercials.  And who wrote the script?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Eric, do you have the script?  Did we get the script?  I think that's Ben's call.  Where's Ben?  Script diva. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, I want to know what this script is all about.  Well, the funny thing is, it's only 10 seconds.  There's not much to do in 10 seconds.  So Anthony and I did a half hour in the studio, all sorts of stuff that added up to 10 seconds,  and even parts that, ah, now you take it and make it into 10 seconds.  Right.  We laid down a whole bunch of stuff, they could cut it into 10 seconds if they wanted to.  How is that not acceptable?  I don't know.  You can't get anything done in 10 seconds.  And we knew it was for TV, so we kept it clean.  You know, it's stuff like, you know, what the show is about and how offbeat we are. 
[00:06:00]  How risque.  They're trying to get real creative with 10 seconds.  That's great.  If you want a creative Opie and Anthony commercial, then you've got to give us 30.  If it's going to be a 10-second spot, okay, fine, we'll go with it.  This is the spot.  Hi, I'm Opie.  I'm Anthony.  And we are back on XM Satellite Radio.  Check us out.  There you go.  Logo.  That's it.  Yeah, that's it.  You're not going to get anything else, Adam, a 10-second spot?  I can't wait to see what ideas they have for us to record this afternoon. 
[00:06:30]  No one knows?  Ben ain't.  They didn't give us the script.  No script yet?  Neither one of us got it.  Okay.  All right.  Well, when we get the script, we'll have to practice on the air for everybody.  Because without a script, we're just going to go in there and pretty much do exactly what we did last time.  Yeah.  Which, I don't know, they won't accept.  Oh, you know what?  Because I'm sick of the BS.  If there's no script, I go home right after the Rolling Stone interview. 
[00:07:00]  Look what we do now.  I go home.  Look what we do now.  Because there's something else going on and they want to have another meeting about it.  I'm like, no.  No more meetings.  No.  I told you how I feel about it and that's it.  Fix the problem.  I'm done scared.  Actually, we could throw that on the air, too.  What's the problem?  Anthony and I will not be doing any more road trips with XM Satellite Radio until things are taken care of.  Yeah, that's it.  We've done our last road trip.  It's been an ongoing thing for four or five months and people, for some reason, are still not listening to us. 
[00:07:30]  Because there's really no one in charge of the channel.  We've said that for a long, long time.  The person that was supposed to be in charge of the channel, I wouldn't even name his name anymore.  You know, he's just too busy.  That's the problem.  I don't think he's incompetent.  I think he just has way too much, you know, things to take care of on a daily basis for XM Satellite Radio.  How much on the plate?  But that's all well and good.  But we need one person to focus on this channel and get it in shape.  Get it in shape now.  Okay?  And one of the problems that we've had for a long time is Club Soda Kenny. 
[00:08:00]  It's not a problem, Opie.  No, he's not a problem.  I'm going to sound like Club Soda Kenny was the problem.  No, he's not a problem as far as where we sit.  But for some reason, it's a problem with XM.  And it's been an ongoing problem.  And basically what it comes down to, we finally got a bill for Club Soda Kenny's services that Anthony and I have to pay.  And it's well over three grand for a couple trips.  So technically, Anthony and I are now losing money to work for XM on the road. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, if we go on the road, we lose money.  So logically, you know, that's just stupid.  And, you know, can we afford that?  Sure, I guess.  But it's the principle of the whole thing.  So we're done.  No more road trips for the Opie and Anthony show.  Shouldn't have to do that.  And this is something I've been telling them would happen if they didn't listen to us and take care of the situation.  Because, like I said, no one is in charge of the channel.  And there's no one that understands what goes on when Anthony and I hit the road and Jim Norton hit the road.  People think...  It's an absolute fucking circus out there. 
[00:09:00]  Yep.  A crazy circus.  It's great and all, and we love it.  But it's completely out of control at times.  And the people at XM...  This isn't a little radio show anymore.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead, Anthony.  They're under the assumption that we need one guy on the road.  And that one guy is Master Poe, who's already working for the organization.  And he should be the one that's on the road with us to take care of all the business.  The fact of the matter is, it's a two-person job.  Poe is great for security.  He's a security guy.  What Poe isn't is a road manager. 
[00:09:30]  He's not a road manager.  He's not expected to be a road manager.  He's security.  Kenny is a road manager.  When you go on the road, you need a road manager.  He's the guy that takes care of everything, coordinates everything, so everybody involved  in the road trip isn't checking in at wrong hotels, running around not in the same place  when we have to be somewhere, arranging transportation, and he's another security guy.  Trying to drag luggage through the streets of Mardi Gras because it wasn't set up right. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, we would never have gotten to the hotel during Mardi Gras if it wasn't for Club Soda Kenny.  The cab or the driver got about ten blocks away.  Yeah.  And it was, you know, it was the heart of Mardi Gras.  There were people everywhere.  Kenny was able to wield some of his power and get us through the crowd.  We love being with the fans.  We love doing the live broadcast.  But, you know, there's a lot to it.  They've got to fess up and take care of Kenny and pay for Kenny. 
[00:10:30]  That's what they've got to do.  He's an integral part of us being on the road.  It's not a goof.  It's not us deciding we want to take friends along with us and want XM to pay for it.  It's the fact of the matter is we need two guys, security guys and a road manager.  Kenny's been a road manager for, what, 18 years?  13 years.  13 years.  Something like that with Dice.  So they want to have another meeting about Anthony and I's security concerns when we hit the road.  And I'm like, no.  No, no meeting. 
[00:11:00]  We've already talked about it a million times.  This is what it is.  Enough talk.  Just take care of the problem.  That's the next problem.  See, we took care of the studio.  We bitched and complained to the point they had to take care of the studio.  Now this place is working.  It's great.  The mics sound awesome.  No one's complaining about the volume on the phones anymore.  That's taken care of.  Well, the next thing is, if you don't take care of it, then Anthony and I simply will not hit the road.  That's all.  That's all.  It's not in our contract we have to hit the road, so we'll just do our show from the studios here in New York, okay? 
[00:11:30]  Yep.  You know, if we're working for XM on the road, then they have to make sure that everything is taken care of.  It's as simple as that.  And we've been saying it for months.  Because Kenny has proven himself as competent.  I mean, he's an oddball, but you know what?  He's caught flight mistakes, like where tickets weren't bought that they were supposed to be bought.  I would have showed up at the airport for New Orleans out there.  You guys told me on the air.  Yeah.  And I would have had no flight to go to New Orleans.  Right.  That's why there will be no more meetings about it. 
[00:12:00]  No.  We've said all this.  We've said it in emails.  We've said it to the people in charge.  They understand the situation, so take care of it.  Right.  And the people do have too many.  It's not Megan or Kevin.  They've got 500 things to do.  Yep.  Whereas with Kenny booking our flights into it, it's the only thing he'll be doing in his whole life.  There's so much more.  Without getting into the details, there's so much more into it.  It's not even funny.  You know, being on the road is a major, major hassle.  Doing the broadcasts are awesome.  We love it. 
[00:12:30]  We love being out.  We love drinking the beers and, you know, and hanging with everybody.  Everything that goes into that stinks.  But getting to that point is a real pain in the ass.  A real pain in the ass, okay?  Yep.  And there's a million things that have gone wrong since we've been here at XM as far as the road trips have gone.  And we don't have to rehash all of them.  But there's just a ton.  A ton.  So we're not out of line here.  So, you know, the bill came in from Kenny, you know, because they only paid for some of this stuff.  And I said, all right, well, fine. 
[00:13:00]  You know, Anthony and I will gladly pay Club Sutter Kenny's bill.  But this also just proves that it just doesn't make sense for us to go on the road anymore.  So we will not be going on the road anymore.  No.  That's it.  All the requests I've read on the message boards about, hey, are they coming down here?  Are they coming to this city or that?  Sorry.  Dude, I wanted to strangle someone this morning.  And he knows who he is because he's like, when I sat with you guys in the studio in February, blah, blah.  But we went over all this.  What?  We didn't go over all this.  We told you it was still a problem. 
[00:13:30]  Mm-hmm.  You know?  And they told us that they weren't paying for Kenny's L.A. trip after the whole thing was set in motion there.  Yeah.  That Anthony was going to go play poker.  You know, that whole poker trip to, you know, in L.A., that was booked well in advance.  Right.  And then pretty much after we committed to the whole thing, then we're being told, well, we're not going to really pay for Kenny.  You know, some of the stuff, some of Kenny's bills in L.A.  We had no choice in the matter at that point.  So the bill finally came in. 
[00:14:00]  I'm like, all right, well, this is what we do now.  This is what we do.  That's it.  No more road trip.  Sorry.  Some of these people are just stupid.  They don't get it.  They think they're just working with some local morning show that, you know, as a goof, you know, you have a little guy, you know, watching their backs and stuff.  Yeah.  They have no idea.  Someone on the road that could also, you know, hang up some banners and stuff and, you know, take a look, make sure everything's okay. 
[00:14:30]  That's what they think.  And, you know, maybe make sure that, you know, we're not going to get microwaved egg sandwiches for breakfast, knowing that I have a real problem if I don't eat breakfast in the morning.  You know, just the dumb, stupid stuff that, quote, a road manager type of guy takes care of.  You know, we all have our dumb concerns, you know, Norton needs affordable prostitution on the road.  I need breakfast.  And Anthony needs those really dark shades in his room so he can get his Howard Hughes sleep.  And sleep.  I've got to make sure the minibar is stocked and I have a high-speed Internet connection. 
[00:15:00]  That's it.  But we all have our dumb little concerns that maybe to the people that are looking in, you know, think are ridiculous.  But it's what we need to do the show.  You know?  What's wrong there, Jimmy?  Oh, no, no, no.  And, you know, it's, uh, I lost my thought.  Damn it.  It was a road thing.  You just sparked a thought.  I lost.  Oh, all right.  Well.  Well, that's the latest as far as the show goes.  No meetings.  Oh.  No meetings and we will not be hitting the road anymore. 
[00:15:30]  Because one thing that Kenny wouldn't be good at is, like, because we really don't need rides.  And Kenny's not good at finding fans in Boston to just pick us up.  You know, why would you need that taken care of?  Why would you need that?  That's the type of stuff he does.  He gets you rides after gigs.  We walked outside and had a fan just give us a ride to the hotel.  I know.  Because we had no transportation.  I know.  That's what Kenny would take care of.  And then you had a concern about getting from the airport to the hotel in Boston.  And instead of someone taking that concern seriously, you're getting laughed at. 
[00:16:00]  You know, you're getting laughed at.  You know, it's stuff like that.  We need someone.  And the person that, quote, supposedly is in charge, he has no idea.  You know, if I'm in charge of the channel, I would have taken one road trip to see exactly what it takes to take the Opie and Anthony show on the road.  And probably as, you know, the boss, I guess, technically on paper, you could even tell us, well, some of this stuff is ridiculous, guys.  Do you really need this?  Do you really need that?  That's a little dumb.  But I see a concern here. 
[00:16:30]  You know, assess the situation.  Yeah.  But no one has even done that, really.  So no more road trips and no meeting about it today.  No, no meeting.  11.30, they're going to discuss it.  Well, great.  You're discussing it without Anthony and I because you already know what our concerns are.  We don't need to tell you our concerns again.  Mm-hmm.  You know, this whole thing, it's over and over and over again.  That's how they work.  You're going to have Ricky represent you in the office on the meeting during the coverage call.  That'll work. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, he called me at quarter to seven, I'm home, getting ready to leave.  At 20 to seven, very responsibly, asking what I'd like for my breakfast, I tell him, my coffee and my little omelet.  Yeah.  40 minutes ago.  Ricky?  Yeah.  And he's still not here.  We're going to get into the whole Ricky the intern thing today.  I need coffee when I walk in.  It's not much.  I don't need a lot.  I just need a medium coffee.  It's all I want.  All right.  Not here.  Where is Ricky?  Who knows?  I don't know.  Maybe he took my order from...  He's here. 
[00:17:30]  He's still in the building?  Where is he?  Oh, he's gone?  Okay.  What time did he go out?  Nathaniel, what time did he go out?  40 minutes ago.  He had a coffee and a fucking omelet.  40 minutes.  Nah.  Here he is.  Oh, here he comes.  Oh, shit.  Here comes Ricky, everybody.  Give him a little credit.  He did take the initiative to call you and see what you'd like.  Which I appreciate.  Which was nice of Ricky.  It was.  Ricky, there's your coffee.  That's right.  Coffee diva.  Oh, God.  This better be right. 
[00:18:00]  I was going to see if the coffee...  Hey, Ben.  Is the TV script here yet?  No, they never sent it.  No, I just talked...  I talked...  They're flying from Boston, those guys.  What time?  They get here...  They'll get here at 11.  Tell them not to fly.  If we don't have a script, we're not...  They have a script.  It's 10 seconds.  Who cares?  It's...  I was hoping, Anthony, you're listening to XM or something stupid.  That's what we did already.  I know, but I didn't...  We don't need to keep doing things over and over again.  I guess they didn't like the inflection in your voice was the problem or something stupid...  I'm not even kidding.  It was something ridiculous.  Are you kidding me?  They're flying these guys from Boston. 
[00:18:30]  Again.  For 10 seconds of audio from us.  I don't know.  Yeah.  But they won't pay for a club soda, Kenny.  Right.  And I'm sure these guys aren't paying their own airfare.  No, of course not.  Yeah.  This is...  This is one of the problems that I'm really going to work hard in solving here.  We do things over and over and over again here.  How many times do we have to rework the studio and complain about the studio until it finally  got done?  That's because Eric Logan, you know, got that guy Don involved.  This Don Wiki guy. 
[00:19:00]  And it's not an act...  It's not a speech impediment.  His nickname is Wiki, W-I-C-K-Y.  Got him involved with the channel.  And so far, I'm very, very happy with what he's done, you know?  Yeah.  Very happy.  Good looking guy.  He came in and actually studied the studio for a few days and realized, well, hey.  You know, some of the guys down in Washington thought that maybe Opie and Anthony didn't  know how to work the equipment.  Yeah.  So he assessed the situation.  He sat in here for a couple days looking over our shoulders and asking a million questions. 
[00:19:30]  And guess what?  Boom.  Everything was solved when we went on break.  Turned out it wasn't us not knowing how to work the equipment.  Go figure that one out.  How nice was it with anything here?  What happened?  Your lid sucks on that cup of coffee.  Dude, those Starbucks lids, are you dripping all over yourself?  Dude, I...  They always do that.  I've been talking about this for weeks.  There's something going on with the Starbucks lids.  I don't know if they went cheaper or something, but I dripped coffee all over my clothes every  morning. 
[00:20:00]  You're just holding it.  All of a sudden, it's on the back of your knuckles and you want to just bury your fist  in somebody's mouth.  Where's Wickey when you need him?  I miss looking over and seeing that smile every morning.  I like him a lot.  That smile lights you up.  I like him a lot because instead of just assuming what's supposed to be done, he gets in there,  he digs in.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He gets involved and he finds out for himself.  Like, he hit the road with us.  Yeah.  So he's going to probably represent us in this dumb meeting today because he actually was  on the road and sees how crazy it is out there. 
[00:20:30]  This non-meeting.  This non-meeting that...  Well, it'll be a meeting, just not for you and I.  All right.  Your order's okay there, Jimmy?  Oh!  Very good.  Thank you.  We got dirt on Ricky.  Ricky, the intern.  Doug out Doug.  What's up, buddy?  Good morning, guys.  Good morning.  I'm thinking quite possibly Ricky could be shopping around for, like, condoms or something  right now for his weekend adventures.  Why?  I don't get it.  Why his weekend adventures?  Well, maybe you can ask him. 
[00:21:00]  He is quite the player on the weekends.  Quite the player?  Quite the player, player.  What do you mean?  His prowess with the girls?  Yes.  He's a little man-whore.  Huh?  Wait, he's a man-whore?  Oh, God, yeah.  Well, does he mean man-whore?  Yeah.  Is he going after men?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  He is a pro with the ladies at the ripe old age of 19. 
[00:21:30]  Now, how do you know this?  I've talked to Ricky a bunch of times on a certain little, one of those AOL messenger type  things, and, okay, the guy's never tongue-kissed a girl.  You've never tongue-kissed a girl, Ricky?  You're being sarcastic.  Hold on.  Before we get into this, Doug, I hear you have a theme song for Ricky the Intern.  Yeah.  Do you guys like it?  I'm not sure.  I'm going to hear it for the first time right now as I push play.  It's really a real one.  He's never kissed a girl.  He's never kissed a girl.  Hold on, Doug. 
[00:22:00]  Sorry.  You didn't know I was going to start with that.  He's never kissed a girl.  He's never seen a V.  Here comes Virgin Ricky.  I love the...  He put it in now.  He's got a catch slurp.  That was especially for Anthony.  Thank you.  God.  It's a catch slurp.  I've got to hear that again.  He's never kissed a girl.  He's never seen a V.  Here comes Virgin Ricky. 
[00:22:30]  I like how you put Ricky.  You gave it three syllables.  Ricky.  So you're a Virgin there, Ricky?  Yeah.  Am I excited on?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Never kissed a girl?  No, I have kissed a girl.  He just...  He's a dick, first off.  Oh.  Oh.  He's nutty.  That hurts me, Ricky.  It's not a real kiss if it's not tongue, guys.  Come on. 
[00:23:00]  Give it to me.  So you've just kissed a girl.  Yeah, I haven't tongueed anything.  Oh, a peck.  Your mom doesn't count.  No, a peck.  An aunt?  No, something like that.  Ben, I went farther with my grandma than you went with a regular girl, dude.  We don't like that.  Well, just putting it in perspective, I'm sorry.  Everyone knows the story of me and my grandma.  Ricky.  It was a slip of the tongue.  I didn't know any better.  I was young.  But I went further with my grandma than you've gone with a strange girl.  You're...  Well, not a strange girl.  I had a girlfriend, but that was like a year or so ago.  A year ago.  You're 19.  Yeah. 
[00:23:30]  So you were 18.  You had a girlfriend.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  And you said you kissed this girl.  Was this the girl you kissed?  Yeah.  But closed mouth.  Yeah.  Not open mouth.  No open mouth.  Yeah.  How long ago?  How long ago?  I dated her for two months.  Two months?  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  How old was she?  She was 16 at the time.  Nice.  How old were you?  I was 18.  Yeah.  And what did you do?  Were you...  When you go out on dates, were you go to the movies and...  Yeah, we went to movies, arcades, stuff like that.  Arcades.  Little kid stuff, yeah. 
[00:24:00]  Kid stuff.  Yeah.  So it's kid stuff.  And then what?  Like you drop her off and when you drop her off at home...  Well, how'd you get around?  Did you drive?  No.  No?  So how would you get around to these little dates?  Buses or cabs.  Buses, cabs.  Maybe a parent would drive you around?  Oh, one time her dad had to pick her up at the end of the night and had to drive me home  too.  That's a good one.  With the family, which was fun.  What is this, the first karate kid?  Mom picks you up in your stupid station wagon?  You got to push start it in front of the rich people's house? 
[00:24:30]  Oh, God damn.  Is that nasty?  But then she broke up with me because...  Aw.  Yeah, because one time she had to go see her stepfather in the Bronx or whatever.  No, her actual father in the Bronx.  And it also happened to be the same place where her ex-boyfriend, who was her first  love, happened to live.  Uh-oh.  And once she came back from the Bronx, she didn't want to talk to me anymore.  Aw, she hooked back up with him and it was all over.  Ricky was out to the curb.  What race was this girl?  Oh, Puerto Rican.  Oh, my God, dude.  What is wrong with you? 
[00:25:00]  Wow.  16, so did you get along with the kids?  Oh, her family?  Our kids.  Do you realize that most 16-year-old girls have kids by that age?  And you can't even get a tongue kiss going?  Yeah, no.  Did you try?  Or were you just too shy?  I was thinking about it, but I didn't.  We were in the midst of making out or whatever.  You weren't making out.  You weren't tongue kissing.  I was going to, but then I was like, I don't know.  In the midst means in the middle of it.  You said in the middle.  So you were in the middle of making out.  What do you consider making out?  We were kissing, you know, hands on face, you know. 
[00:25:30]  Hands on face?  Hands on face, you creep.  That's how blind people recognize you.  That's not making out.  It's the Vulcan mind meld you were giving each other.  Hands on face.  Ugh.  Hands on face.  Ugh.  So you're brushing her face with your hand.  No, I was on one hand.  She was on mine, you know, whatever.  Looking deeply into her eyes.  No, no.  We had our eyes closed.  We don't take our eyes open.  Your eyes were closed, and you were closed mouth kissing.  So you just lip to lip, and then what?  Moving your head back and forth a little bit? 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, just like that, yeah.  What happened?  You were going for the tongue, but you got lost on the way?  No.  Wow, that's like how you make out when you're, I got to be honest with you, that's how you  make out when you're like eight or nine years old with a girl.  Yeah, but she happened to be like my first girlfriend, that's why, so it's, yeah.  First girlfriend.  You must have been crushed when she didn't want to see anymore.  Must have been crushed when she went back to banging her ex-boyfriend.  Yeah, exactly.  How experienced was she sexually? 
[00:26:30]  She told me she was a virgin, but.  Yeah?  Don't know.  Oh, she did?  Hmm?  What's happened there, Jimmy?  She's a PR from the Bronx.  She's not a virgin.  Yeah, exactly.  That's kind of hinted at me, that virgin.  Hey, um, Ricky.  She only took it in the butt.  Yeah, Doug.  Ricky, wasn't it part of the story that the boyfriend actually started taking your lunch  money and beating you up and hit you, and your arm flew into her breast?  Uh, no.  Huh?  What are you talking about, Doug?  Okay.  What are you going for here, Doug?  I'm just trying to make Ricky look a little better than he's looking like. 
[00:27:00]  I'm giving Doug a car crash.  Damn, that's my first.  So what happened, La Russa?  I mean, you went out, and she just wouldn't kiss you, or you were too nervous to try?  Uh, what do you mean?  Like, the first time?  Tongue kiss, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, the tongue kiss?  Like, we were in the middle, and I just, I was thinking about it, but I was like, nah,  I don't want to be rude or something, I don't know.  Be rude?  Be rude.  Being rude is sticking your tongue in her ass without asking.  Yay!  La Russa's sleeping.  La Russa's sleeping.  Now, you went out there.  I was going to a funeral of a family member. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  Jesus.  I mean, calm down there, Ricky.  Oh, my God.  I'm rude.  You eat a girlfriend and girlfriend.  Yeah, it's acceptable.  Yeah.  So, now, as far as her or any other girl, did you ever put your hands anywhere?  Oh, she's sleeping.  No.  No.  Just the face?  Yeah, that's about it.  I never went, I never felt boobs.  Shoulder, anything like that?  Yeah, her arm.  Her arm.  So, what about a hip?  Yeah, hip.  Put your hands on her hip, things like that.  But never over the shirt, a brush of the breast? 
[00:28:00]  No.  And not even down the pants or anything like that?  No.  No, no, no.  So, what's the problem, man?  I'm too shy.  You're shy?  Yeah.  You're too shy shy.  And you haven't had a girlfriend since?  Yeah.  So, that must have really gotten you, to be honest here, it must have really gotten you  worked up to just do a closed mouth kiss with a girl.  Yeah.  You must have been really, like, you know, sporting, as they say.  You must have been sporting pup tent.  Most likely. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah?  Most likely.  And then, what would you do?  You can't just leave that stuff alone as a guy.  You get what they call blue balls, which is a painful, painful, throbbing pain in your  sack if you've had a hard on for any length of time.  We know this from having to do the dry hump in the basement of a girlfriend's houses way  back when we were teens, you would sit there with a girl making out and doing the dry hump.  You ever do any of that dry humping, Ricky?  You ever do a dry hump?  No.  You've never dry humped?  Nope.  Through the jeans? 
[00:29:00]  You've never experienced the pleasure of dry humping?  No.  Oh, where you actually have chafing marks on the underside of your schlong from your underwear  because you're just humping, dry humping all night, and you wake up with a hurt, injured  penis and blue balls.  Well, not blue balls.  Sometimes you go home with a nice sticky feeling.  I've never shot one from dry humping.  Really?  Never.  It was always just very worked up.  And then, if too much time goes by, you can't jack to release it because you'll still get 
[00:29:30]  the blue balls.  Really bad.  Really painful.  Did you ever wake up and feel sticky, Frank?  You can tell us.  We'll tell you how to clean this up.  Well, of course.  I mean, who hasn't?  Well, what guy hasn't?  You lack your bag, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  How often?  Like a monkey, I bet.  No.  No?  I can't control myself.  You do?  Yeah.  I can't, I can't.  Once a day?  No, like maybe, like once a week or something like that. 
[00:30:00]  Once a week?  Yeah.  Once a week?  Jesus, Batman.  Why once a week?  I don't know.  I can't.  I want you to love me.  I think I feel still.  I want you to love me.  I touch my face.  I want you to find me.  I forget myself.  Listen to the echo.  I want you to love me.  Oh, I'm waiting.  Yeah.  I don't want anybody else. 
[00:30:30]  When I think I've built you, that's why I said, oh, I don't want anybody else.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  He probably gets ready to jack it and is all in the mood and ready to go.  And then just this image of Jimmy yelling at him for coffee pops in his head and ruins  the whole goddamn thing.  Has the fantasy set up.  Maybe the ex from the Bronx and ready to spank away.  Grabs hold of it.  And all he's thinking of holding is that cup of wrong coffee and giving it to Jimmy. 
[00:31:00]  What is this?  Oh, fuck it.  I got, uh, I got audio of Ricky, uh, J-O-ing Anthony.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I just happen to have it here.  Right?  Oh, excuse me, Ricky.  Oh.  Ricky, I did see what you were doing.  It felt good, didn't it?  It's all right.  We all have feelings like this sometimes.  I'm just glad you're doing this in the privacy of your own room.  When you're a little bit older, we'll have to talk more about these feelings and what causes them 
[00:31:30]  and how we can control these feelings.  I'm sorry I intruded on your privacy.  I'll be sure to knock next time.  Okay?  I adore you.  I get down on my knees.  I'd do anything for you.  I adore you.  Have you ever had a girl like you to love your mom?  No.  Yeah, no girls ever put their hands on you anywhere? 
[00:32:00]  No.  Wow.  How did you make it this far?  You're 19, dude.  I don't know.  I could not imagine being that age from, any age from 12 to 20.  In that whole thing of your teens, I could not imagine not having sexual contact with a girl.  My head would have exploded.  That's why you have such a problem getting these orders right sometimes and finding stores.  Your head is so full of sex that you just need it released. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  You're full of sperm, bro.  It's the sperm.  It's the sexual thoughts and ideas.  Things you haven't experienced.  You're whacking once a week at 19 years old and you don't have a chick?  Yeah.  Dude, and I would easily be doing it three times a day.  I'd be doing it here.  Right.  If I were you.  Like, right now, talking into the mic, I'd just be jacking it.  How do you not?  Ooh.  Ooh.  Jimmy got a little ooh.  Well, I don't know about that, guys.  Personally, I think that you jerk off more after you actually get it. 
[00:33:00]  You think?  I remember I was like a once every now and then kind of guy, and then I got laid, and  now I'm a three-time-a-day guy.  I don't know.  Man.  I think you're just on that constant quest to get that feeling the way it is with the  woman so you don't need her anymore, so you practice a lot more.  No, before I even got laid, it was like after the very first time, it was then nonstop.  I found something like gold.  It was treasure. 
[00:33:30]  It was something that, why would you not do this any second you can do it?  Why are you not doing it?  Why aren't you jerking off?  Why aren't you stomping Private Pile's ball bag off?  You should be jerking off after every meal.  At the least.  That's right.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Food and a whack.  Food and a whack.  You like porn?  Have you had any other girlfriends?  No.  No.  No other girlfriends.  So the first girlfriend you've ever had was just how long ago? 
[00:34:00]  Like a year or so ago.  A year or so ago, and it was for a couple of months.  Anything, any prospects?  I mean, anything involving another girl?  Of course not.  No.  Look at them.  No little pecking of the cheek in elementary school?  I mean, I'm including anything.  Holding hands with a girl when you were a kid?  Only when I was like five, when like this one girl was like in love with me, but I didn't  know what the hell it was at the time.  I was like, at that point, it was like, ew, girls, but this one girl was in love with  me, where like... 
[00:34:30]  Sounds like at this time, you're like, ew, girls.  Were you ew, girls?  Yeah, at that point.  But I didn't know what the hush was doing.  I was like, it was like my sister's friend's little sister.  We were about the same age, and they would just leave us in a room together, and she would  be running towards me, jumping on me, tackling me down, and kissing my lips.  Wow.  Yeah.  How about that?  That's pretty good.  Did you smell your breath?  I mean, you know what was like sex when you were in elementary school?  When they would open up the gym doors, and bring in the girls and the guys at the same 
[00:35:00]  place.  This was like maybe fourth, fifth grade, something like that.  And tell us we were square dancing.  We were doing square dancing.  Oh my God.  They were separate.  This happened a lot.  I don't know if it's a Long Island, Midwest thing or something.  But they would have square dancing.  Can I go back with you a little bit?  Because was your school like mine, where the guys did gym separately from the girls?  Yeah.  And then you had the huge...  Accordion door.  The huge accordion door that separated the gym.  Giant.  And every once in a while, you'd get to gym class. 
[00:35:30]  You had no idea what was going on that day, but...  Hit the switch!  Hit the switch, and...  The door opens, and you're like...  There's girls over there!  There's girls!  Look what they wear for gym class!  It was such a cool thing, because you're not in your regular school clothes.  You're in shorts and a t-shirt, and the girls are in their, like, skirts and t-shirts.  So you're not in your regular, like, dress school clothes.  And that door opens up.  You're not as dressed as you usually were. 
[00:36:00]  So the door opens, you see the girls, and it was just like this primal, growling thing  would come over you as you look at these girls.  And now, since it's square dancing, there's contact, there's physical contact with girls  that you sit in these classes with on a daily basis, never touch, barely talk to, and now  you're being forced by the teachers to hold hands, put your arm around their waists, and  dude, this was sex for you as a kid.  It stands out in my mind as some of the most exciting moments of my life back then. 
[00:36:30]  I am so with you.  That and climbing the rope.  Well, the rope never really did me justice.  Really?  No.  That's when I discovered that this thing could do a lot more than just...  From the rope in between your legs?  Oh, my God.  I had not...  Well, we were climbing rope, you know, very early on, and that was...  Yeah, that's when I finally realized, wow, look what this thing can do.  No, there was a whole choosing of a couple's thing that went on?  No, no, no, not my... 
[00:37:00]  Really?  No.  What happened with us was the dyke gym teacher that took care of the girls would tell all  the girls to line up, and then we had to line up on our side, and then that's who you figured  you were going to be matched up with.  How did they line you up?  Alphabetically?  No, they would just say, line up, and you didn't know what that meant at first.  That's what happened with us.  And then all of a sudden, you're like, oh, like, start counting.  Oh, I see what's going on here.  You'd start counting down the line.  You'd count yourself, count down the line, and see, and then try to trade with a friend, 
[00:37:30]  and it was all done in a matter of seconds, because you know you didn't have a lot of  time.  So I would look down and go, oh, no, I'm with Pam, and I want to be over here with this  girl.  So you'd get, you know, one of the guys that are across from them and go, you want to  trade with me?  And for the guy that was across from the real pig, no one would trade with me.  Yeah, but it worked both ways, because I remember counting on and looking, and it was one  of the hottest girls in my grade at the time, and the disappointment on her face.  Oh, no, really?  Oh, I was the guy.  I'm a little, skinny, kid-like Opie. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  Oh, I was just a skinny mess.  Skinny mess, and the disappointment on her face.  Oh, I'm a rock star now.  Showed you.  You whore.  And then once you got paired off with the girl, they would start teaching you the square  dancing.  And the first part of it was you stood face-to-face, and you had to hold each other's hands.  Yeah.  You know, at your...  Dude, I am so with you on this. 
[00:38:30]  And I remember just the sweaty, warm hands.  The girl, too.  You know, my hands were all sweaty and stuff, but the girl's hands were all sweaty and warm.  And you'd grab hold, and it was just like...  You couldn't breathe right.  I swear to you, I remember that.  I couldn't breathe in a rhythmic fashion.  It was just like this stuttering breathing.  Instant boner.  Instant boner that you're trying to hide in your gym shorts.  One of those...  It was amazing.  One of those boners that just aches.  Oh, an aching rod.  I mean, Rod, just aching. 
[00:39:00]  Not just the normal ones.  And you're sweating, and you're trying to listen to the teacher give these orders for square  dancing, and all you're thinking is, I am so worked up into a sexual froth, I can't  function.  Did you ever get that, Ricky?  No.  Jesus Christ.  Of course not.  Take off your stupid hat to begin with.  My God, do you have to get...  Look at your hat.  It says the special teams.  That hat does...  That hat is not going to get...  That hat is not going to get to the good looks on the streets of Manhattan. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  From potential chicks.  And that eyebrow mustache has to go.  It's awful.  That mustache stinks.  All right.  I'll shave it off.  One hair every three inches.  I'll shave it off.  More whiskers than a mustache.  It's horrendous.  Hey, chocolate milk mouth.  That's what it looks like.  We're going to whip you in a shape, son.  Hey, Rod, how's the mustache coming in?  Well, maybe that's the...  It's almost precedent. 
[00:40:00]  Is that the style, Ricky, that mustache?  I just prefer not to shave it.  I shaved it once, and I didn't like it.  Wait, that's not even you, like, trimming it up?  That's how it grows in?  No, I trimmed it before.  Whenever I get a haircut, like, whenever I get my tape or whatever.  He's trying for the Lando Calrissian mustache is what you're doing there.  Yeah.  You really are.  A little thin.  Oh, the one Ricky Ricardo grew.  Just off, Lucy.  I'm going to tell you another thing.  Most dudes that grow mustaches nowadays, making sure no one else has one here, when, guess  what?  No one else does have one here. 
[00:40:30]  No, no one does.  That's like the sign of the homo.  That's right.  The big, bushy mustache.  You want to give your new friend a place to rub clear stuff.  That's what the mustache is.  The clear stuff holder.  A bunch of guys looking at their rearview mirrors right now, but I'm just saying, in  general, the mustache is, uh, cops and gay porno actors, pretty much, are the only ones  that can wear mustaches these days.  In the year 2005?  Yeah.  Some guys wear the mustache, and they pull it off, and they're banging broads left and 
[00:41:00]  right.  I understand.  I understand.  You guys are out there, okay?  Right.  But then there's a lot of guys that are wearing the mustache, and it's the, eh, Sheffield.  Sheffield's got the mustache?  Sheffield's got the small.  Gary, Sheffield's got the smaller mustache.  Sheffield.  Yeah.  That's different.  And Sheffield is making $40 million a contract.  He's not fucking up coffee orders.  All right.  This is what I would suggest, Ricky.  You've got to shave the mustache.  Yeah.  Ricky, when are you getting the braces off?  Um, should be in the next couple of months.  Next couple of months?  How long have you had braces?  Uh, over two years.  Over two years.  How about the ones on your legs? 
[00:41:30]  Run, force.  You've, um, you've had them two years, and they've worked?  Mm-hmm.  You've had what, buck teeth?  No, I just, all the teeth kind of grew in crooked, and I didn't take out a few  of my, uh, baby teeth.  So, that's pretty good.  That's pretty good.  You, uh, you stepped up with that.  That's adorable!  Stepped up with that, you know?  What about your living arrangement?  What do you mean?  Mom and dad, come on.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, of course.  But, but people live with their parents and still get laid? 
[00:42:00]  You have your own room in there?  Yeah.  You can share it with a sibling or something?  No.  What's on your walls?  Yeah.  Nothing.  Nothing?  That's nice.  Plain walls, like a true sociopath.  Just a thin mustache, dry-humping to the visions of tortured animals.  No posters?  No.  No?  You can, no trophies from school?  Nothing like that?  No.  No?  No, no, I never got a trophy.  No, yeah, exactly.  No Ashton pictures?  No.  Ashton Kutcher?  He's cool, right?  Yeah, to the white kids.  Oh, who's the Puerto Rican kids like? 
[00:42:30]  Are you Puerto Rican?  No, I'm El Salvadorian, but I'm not.  Oh, sure.  They like the usher.  No, it's the same thing.  Yeah.  That could be half your problem right there.  I've heard that before.  El Salvadorian.  It's kind of suave.  Suave?  Young El Salvadorian boy with fine abs.  Straight teeth.  Good boy.  I think after he gets the braces off, matures a little more.  Maybe gets a better hat, Anthony.  Yeah.  I mean, the hat.  This is a goof hat, though.  This is like a Simpsons, you know?  I understand.  It's what's his name for the Simpsons, and it says, what, special teams, right? 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, that's great.  I think he'll do all right.  He's what you call a late bloomer.  Yes.  Is what they call him.  But enough with the goofy hats.  It's time to dump.  You know, you're 19 trying to get laid.  You don't want to walk around with a hat with the little beer can holders on it.  Hi, girls.  Waka, waka.  Ladies.  It's a nutty hat.  This just in, though, Ant.  Ricky is on his way.  He's got a new job.  Congratulations, Ricky.  People make relationships in the workplace, which is good.  Ricky's new job, making tacos.  What? 
[00:43:30]  Perfect.  Get used to that shape and the smell.  That is really great.  You've got to make the tacos before you can eat the tacos.  So you're on your way, buddy.  You're making tacos?  Yeah.  Where at?  At Chipotle.  Where's that?  I don't want to give a big exact answer.  Are they making the tacos?  Of course.  They don't want to get out.  They just have the burritos.  Because people are just going to be, you know, breaking down the doors to see you.  No, it's not that.  Yeah, you're right.  Some girl might want to come and see if you're cute.  Why give out that address? 
[00:44:00]  Some lady might be listening to this program and say,  that guy sounds cute and kind of endearing,  and I wouldn't mind kissing him and knowing he doesn't have any diseases.  With an open mouth.  Yeah.  You have to make that noise, by the way, when you kiss.  That's what sex is.  When your mouth is open and you're kissing, you have to go.  That's right.  That's the tongue noise.  In my defense, though, there is, like, one girl that's kind of messing with me,  but I'm not sure she is kind of a sore.  Kind of messing with you?  Yeah.  What do you mean messing?  Like, I have my own show at the college or whatever,  and she's only there when I'm there. 
[00:44:30]  So, I mean, I see that, and then she's also telling me that she would bless me.  Well, I mean, blessing me by taking my virginity or whatever.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  She wants to take your virginity?  Yeah.  I think that's pretty much not messing with you.  That's, I think that's, she wants to get you laid.  Well, how does she know you're a virgin?  Well, because I...  Did you tell her?  Was that your opening line?  No, it just was brought up in conversation, and it was said, and I said, yeah, I am.  You are, and she said she would take care of that?  Is she hot?  She's really hot.  Really hot.  She's extremely hot, and Puerto Rican again. 
[00:45:00]  And she's Puerto Rican?  Yeah.  Wow.  She probably said it in some fun way, like, oh, I'll take care of that.  Ha, ha, ha.  You can't believe I have a red girl horse.  She said that for, like, a couple of weeks in a row, so I really don't know.  It could be real, but in the same sense, it could be, like he said, kind of...  What would her motive be?  She just wants to get laid.  Oh, with your luck, you'd get her pregnant, and he'd be, like, the first time, he'd have  a kid.  A boyfriend would come shoot you.  She loves to taste the communion way for his father.  She loves to taste the communion way.  You'd think maybe the Pope could give her, you know, special dispensation for an abortion? 
[00:45:30]  I gotta go with one of Jim Norton's jokes here, though.  You know, if he gets a girl pregnant, there's no problems there.  She's not gonna have the kid.  Do you think that she'd just throw herself down the stairs?  Aw.  Yeah, she's not going.  I don't know.  He seems to be, like, that guy that might be the sucker.  She's not going full-term with Ricky's kid.  Working at the taco place.  Nah.  Having to give 50% of his taco income to a kid.  I'm sorry, but...  Well, I shouldn't quote Jimmy.  You shouldn't maybe do it. 
[00:46:00]  That's the beauty of looking like Ricky, basically.  He can get girls pregnant, and they're not gonna have the kids.  No need to pull out, Rick.  Remember, it's not your problem.  Do we have an actual air check of your radio show?  Oh.  Ooh.  All right.  This can maybe showcase some of your talent.  This is actual audio from my show.  It sucks, just to give you a warning.  No, no.  Don't.  Don't be such a negative, Nelly.  This will showcase some of your talent, and maybe that'll get the girls on board, too.  You're covering all the bases here.  You gotta get the look thing down, the talent thing, the personality, and then the girls just 
[00:46:30]  come swarming.  What's the name of your show?  It's just my show.  It's just the Ricky show, whatever.  The I jerk off once a week virgin show.  You should actually call it the Ricky show, whatever.  Yeah.  My show, Ricky show, whatever.  Yeah, they would have...  Before, my DJ name was Ricky Martin playing off of my last name, but I dropped that name.  Really?  Yeah.  Why?  Because of the androgynous singer that make him a...  Yeah.  All right.  The singer that's kind of gay?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So that's why I kind of dropped it. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  The Ricky Martin show.  Yeah, that's what it was called.  Yeah, that's what it was called.  You're living La Vida boring.  Valhalla, New York.  The voice of Westchester Community College.  I forgot I had to turn the mic on.  Good morning, everybody.  It's Ricky here with you.  I keep forgetting about this board.  It's 10 o'clock, and I'm starting my show up.  914-606-6753.  Instead of meeting the cast of Chappelle's show this morning, instead of meeting Charlie 
[00:47:30]  Murphy and Darnell Rawlings and Billy Burr, I came here.  But, oh well, whatever.  That's ridiculous.  How are you going to go ahead and do that?  I got you.  Wait, who's the chick in the background?  Oh, that's some fat, annoying chick that everybody hates at the station.  Go ahead, stick it in her.  That'll be perfect.  We're going to break it in.  You're going to be awful the first time, so just take it out on her.  That's true.  I'm not desperate.  And what is she saying to you in the background?  She's just like, nah, you should have. 
[00:48:00]  What are you doing here and this and that?  Oh.  I have an idea.  Would you ever have sex?  How would you feel about tossing a man face first out of a wheelchair?  Laying him on the bed and he's not desperate either.  Well, he is desperate.  Yeah.  You should be very desperate.  I don't know.  I have some respect for this kid, though.  Tim, where that shot, that was pretty good.  Because he's trying to make something out of himself, wants to be in radio, right?  Yeah.  And he knew he needed to go do his radio show in practice instead of blowing it off to  meet celebrities here on our show. 
[00:48:30]  Because that's what he's referring to, the day he had the cast on.  Yeah, I know, Rawlings.  I respect you for that.  I like his delivery.  Hey.  Thank you.  How are you going to go ahead and do that?  I got Christina in this video.  You should get slapped for that.  I got Christina in this video.  Do not play that nasty, disgusting, cornball song.  What?  Oh, yeah.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Before I go into that.  I was going to, yeah.  And then there was another thing I was going to bring up.  Not only did I skip meeting the three guys from Chappelle's show.  Well, I come in today. 
[00:49:00]  It's like 10 minutes before my show and I'm getting requests to Ronnie.  Look at that.  Yeah, I know.  I had the last...  I had that last time, last week.  I didn't even get to, like, do anything.  And as soon as, like, I just, like, as soon as I stepped into the studio, the phone was  ringing, like, off the hook.  So I'm like, hello?  He's like, can I get a request for such and such?  I'm like, okay.  Click.  Boom.  Back to the day.  Can I have requests for this? 
[00:49:30]  I'm like, I have requests for five different songs.  I'm like, jeez.  Like, you ruined my...  Just write them down.  That's no big deal.  But it kind of ruined my setup.  And then the same woman, that first woman that called me...  Yeah, she talks late too much.  She's like, oh, I'm at work and stuff like that.  I don't want to interrupt the captivating radio.  Yeah.  I kept them on for too long.  I was just, wow.  No, it's not only that.  It's the...  You should have smashed her in the face back.  She walked all over you, bro.  The Pac-Man theme music behind you.  Yeah.  Makes that a boom, boom, boom, boom. 
[00:50:00]  Wow.  Yeah, that's that biggie.  Why don't you smash her back?  It's your show.  Get in there, Ricky.  Yeah, I've been too kind with allowing anybody to walk into my show.  And now I'm starting to take control of it.  Babels.  Yeah, it just...  How long have you been on?  About a year now.  A year?  Oh, I forgot.  You got to turn the microphone on.  I have self-delivered.  This is Ricky.  Hi, this is Ricky.  Hi, Scott.  We have just a little more for today.  Music.  Yeah.  You requested for a song that you can't even hear. 
[00:50:30]  Okay, real smart.  Like, very nice, but...  Use the C word.  Oh, it's too early in the morning.  It's too early in the morning.  Yeah, it's crazy.  It's very shocking.  Man, I'm going to start it off with a request.  I didn't get his name, though, but he requested Shane Hall.  Yes, for the anonymous caller.  Anonymous.  Anonymous.  For the anonymous caller, Shane Hall.  Boom, boom, tap.  On the new sound of Power 88, 914-606-6753.  Out. 
[00:51:00]  They're ready.  Ricky, your delivery is pretty quiet.  Yeah.  Thanks for the number, guys.  Hey, I'm...  I'm here.  Oh, Jesus.  That's right.  Thanks for the number.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, not like anybody from Wack Bag is going to be calling that one up.  Yeah, when do you do your show over there?  Thursday mornings.  All right, well, now you're going to have a huge audience.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  What time?  10 to 12.  10 to 12, Thursday morning.  Thursday morning.  Oh, I thought he was competing in the New York area.  Actually, you've got to be about a mile from the campus, I'm assuming.  10 miles, actually.  10 miles from the campus. 
[00:51:30]  You're going to hear Ricky do his radio show.  How do you have your own radio show and not get laid?  Chicks love that.  Yeah.  Do they email you?  No, I don't give my email.  Yeah, why would you?  They might contact you.  Give out your email.  And what was that twat babbling about?  I completely forgot about that thing because she just went on and on, and I really just  tried to move on, but she just, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but whatever.  Dude, how about giving out your email or create an email address that you can give out over  the air that maybe some box can write to you?  There you go.  I was thinking about it, but I don't know.  You don't know what?  I don't think I'm ready for that yet.  You're not ready for what? 
[00:52:00]  Hello?  Respond?  Send a pic?  What is it not ready for?  I'm not confident in the show yet.  I know it still sucks, so it's like, you know.  Well, that didn't stop me on this program from giving out my email address.  Who cares?  Nick from Wisconsin.  Ricky makes Terry Schiavo seem lively.  Yeah.  That's a real laid-back delivery you got there.  Yeah.  I'm coming in late.  Your voice is not real.  Bro, here's the deal.  Before you do your radio show, do a few lines of coke.  Just get the energy up. 
[00:52:30]  You know, somebody else has told me that, too.  Or how about drink some Red Bull something?  Coffee?  And Bert from Philly says, not turning on the mics first.  He's already good enough to take Opie's job.  I have a couple instant feedbacks here from whackbag.com, one of your message boards.  Ricky, they seem to think that this woman that was talking to you is fat.  Is this true?  Yes, indeed.  Yeah, because I can hear the fucking Twinkie in her mouth.  Why don't you attack her for being a fat guy?  I'm guessing she's black. 
[00:53:00]  No, she's Puerto Rican.  Everyone's Puerto Rican.  No, Ricky, this is what we want you to do.  We want you to do your show, and the next time she comes in, we want to see how you handle it.  We want you to handle it differently, tape the whole thing, and then bring it in to us.  That's your school project.  All right.  Toolbag Johnson from New Orleans is saying, Ricky's show is like the El Salvadorian Joaquin Phoenix.  He's got a whisper.  Why must you always request this?  Hi, that's Ricky.  His low voice.  I sneezed and my mustache fell off. 
[00:53:30]  You guys, we're kind of his boss, because this is like an internship.  Kind of.  Here's your project.  Like eyelashes under his nose.  It's sickening.  We're supposed to teach you radio, I guess.  Here's your project.  You do your show this Thursday.  This bitch is going to walk in with all her fatness and try to get all up in your grill.  All up in your grill.  Way to go.  And we want you to attack back.  It's your show.  Take control.  That's right.  I want to hear these words on your show.  Shut up, bitch. 
[00:54:00]  I'm doing my program.  That's right.  My program.  And you bring that tape in, and we'll critique that one next, okay?  And then turn the mic on and say it again so she can hear you.  Will you do that?  Sure, she can.  Will you have some kind of confrontation on your own radio show when this girl comes in next?  Because she does the show before you, right?  No, she was just there.  All right.  Well, the next time she's there and she's doing her thing, you smash her in the face back verbally.  She hasn't been there lately just because everybody's just made fun of her and just making fun of the fact that she's fat and she's always on the phone. 
[00:54:30]  All right.  Well, that's your project.  And stop at the brown.  What's with you in brown?  It's all brown shirts and brown hats.  Yeah.  Who told you you look good in brown?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I just thought whatever.  It's okay once in a while, but it's all brown.  It's like, no, get some lighter colors.  Show off your eyes.  What's your crew?  What's your crew like, Ricky?  Do you hang out with friends?  Not that much anymore.  Not that much?  I'm in school and work and here.  Do you have any guy friends?  Yeah.  Yeah?  And what are they like? 
[00:55:00]  Do they go out with girls?  Have they had sex?  Oh, of course they have, yeah.  They have.  Of course they have.  Well, I don't know.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Yeah, they have, yeah.  Okay, they do.  And do they tell you these stories?  Wow, what a pile up.  Oh, my God.  And Teaneck.  That is a real.  Like the Ricky show on video.  Yeah, that's Ricky's appearance right there on the highway.  All right.  A tractor trailer, a box truck, another tractor trailer.  Yeah, that's the wreck of the day, everybody.  Oh, God, do I hope Dragon Wagon is one of those trucks.  Oh, right.  Wouldn't that be great? 
[00:55:30]  I'm here in Teaneck.  Ah!  The tractor trailer is split in half.  Yep.  Good one.  That's a good three-hour delay, easily.  So, Ricky, as I was saying, do these guys tell you about it?  Oh, yeah.  I've heard plenty, plenty of stories.  You've heard plenty of stories.  And does it make you kind of, I don't know, jealous?  No, it just sort of depresses me.  I'm like, damn, I haven't done anything.  And these dudes have already done, like, a few to a lot of things.  Does it sound cool?  Yeah.  Yeah, it sounds pretty cool.  What, have you talked to me about BJs and stuff? 
[00:56:00]  Girls giving them head, and you just got to go, oh, that must be nice?  Yeah, basically.  I'm like, yeah.  God, that's rough.  And what do you talk about, how you brushed a girl's cheek once?  I don't say anything.  I just said, oh, you have a kind face.  It's too creaked, touching each other's faces.  Dirty, germ-filled fingers.  Taco stuff all over.  I accidentally pokes her in the eye in that romantic moment.  Boink.  Ow!  What you do?  Why are you doing that, Ricky?  Why you poke my eye, Ricky?  I'm going back to my boyfriend.  We have 30 seconds left of Ricky's college radio show. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, I thought we were done.  Oh, no, this is the song.  Oh, this is the song?  Yeah, that's fine.  Yeah, I just had a five-accident.  All right.  All right.  Well, I guess we're done with Ricky.  That was great.  That was good radio.  All right, so your job is to confront this pig, and you also got to get an email address  that you give out over the air.  Yeah.  For chicks.  Just for the chicks.  Guys will email you, too.  That's fine.  Say, hey, email me.  You're going to get a couple emails.  Why don't we come up with maybe an email address for him?  All right.  Tongue me. 
[00:57:00]  Tongue me at AOL.com.  Could be good.  I'm sure that's been done.  Tongue me?  Yeah, it's probably taken.  We can't.  Tongue me 1389 or something.  We've got to give it to him privately, because, you know, someone will grab it as soon as you  see it on the air.  Swap spit.  Yeah.  How about I've never sunk this meat into anythingliving.com for your new website?  Look N for pussy.  Something like that.  I like when you use just a letter and a number to say things.  What's with the brown watch, by the way?  Oh, I don't know.  The brown watch, too? 
[00:57:30]  I gave me this for Christmas.  You are into brown.  Why did one of the interns send me a note to look at your fingernails?  What's wrong with your fingernails?  Let me see.  Wow, look at that thumbnail.  Let me see.  Is that something in the El Salvadorian community?  Wow, wait a minute.  What's going on with the pinky nail?  Does dirt get under them when you're sleeping in your coffin?  Dude, you've got like a Coke nail.  That's for our two hands.  Yeah.  What's wrong with you?  Dude, why do you have such long fingernails?  I usually just don't cut them.  I wait for a while, and then I get tired of them and cut them.  Dude, you've got a Coke nail, and you don't do drugs. 
[00:58:00]  No.  You see how long that nail is?  I know.  Hold your hand up this way.  Don't move it around.  Let me see.  Your thumbnail is huge.  Yeah.  Your pinky nail is huge.  What?  Oh.  So, Louis Cipher, when are you going to get your nails trimmed and start your own email  address?  Those are awful nails.  You have to.  Girls will look at that and be freaked out.  They will not appreciate the long nail.  Yeah, some of them I've bitten off, too, so it doesn't really help.  Yeah.  Wow.  Look at that.  Just file them.  Eric, you must get a camera and snap a close-up shot of that hand. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, just put the hand on it.  Because that must go up on the website.  Yeah, put the hand on it.  Put the hand on the console and take a picture of it.  And snap a picture.  All right.  Wow.  That is messed up.  There it is.  All right, Anthony, we should take a break.  Wow.  I think we're done with Ricky.  Did you cut the girl's face when you were brushing it with your hand?  No.  Jesus.  That's really creepy.  You just like long nails?  No.  I just...  Buddy.  Trim them. 
[00:59:00]  That's very telling.  Yeah, guys just don't let their nails grow.  No.  Unless you're into it.  You've got to keep them.  Yeah, like a crazy guy will grow the pinky nail real long for the coke.  Like, I never owned a nail clipper because I would just bite my own nails.  And then that habit went away, finally, thank God.  And now every once in a while, I'll forget about them a little bit and go, whoop, whoop.  And then, you know, rush in the bathroom and get them, you know, chopped down nice.  Clip that.  Do you own a nail clipper?  Yeah.  Do you own a nail clipper?  Yeah.  Okay.  Why the long nails? 
[00:59:30]  There's something there.  No, I just get lazy and just feel like...  Dude, lazy.  You know how long you have to go without cutting your nails to get them that long?  That's not just a little over the top.  That's like...  That, as a first impression, tells people, maybe this guy isn't taking care of himself.  Really is.  Yeah.  Or maybe that he's a little, you know, feminine.  Weird.  Which could be all right, too, I guess.  Whatever you're into.  You a pita pumper?  What? 
[01:00:00]  All right.  Ricky, our intern.  Thank you, Ricky.  Ricky, thank you.  Work on that email address.  Yeah, we'll definitely let you be.  Flip those nails.  And, all right, well, we learned he likes to whack off, so...  Well, not as often as he should, though.  Hey, Ricky, you got...  Ricky.  Oh, no.  He didn't fall for it.  Good for him.  Gotta give him that.  Doug, thanks for throwing Ricky under the bus today.  Yeah.  Guys, God bless.  That's what friends are for.  All right.  See ya.  There he goes.  Dug out, Doug.  What a weirdo.  Yeah, there's something going on there.  That is a weirdo. 
[01:00:30]  Wow.  He might just be a geek.  No, that's a strange guy.  That's one of those weird guys.  Walks around school, and you look at him and go, that's the weird guy.  You idiot.  You idiot.  Napoleon Dynamite.  Look at him, and it's the weird guy.  Vote for Pedro.  Vote for Pedro.  Vote for Ricky.  Vote for Ricky.  See, you know, Napoleon Dynamite made, like, dudes like that cool. 
[01:01:00]  Guy.  You idiot.  Stupid.  I watched that movie for the third time.  It gets funnier, man.  I'm still trying to figure it out.  I'm obsessed with that movie, because the first time, I'm sitting there going, uh, all right.  What are you doing?  Yeah, but then there was something about it.  I had to keep going back to the damn movie.  Really funny.  And now you see Vote for Pedro t-shirts all over the place.  Vote for Pedro.  They're just weirdos. 
[01:01:30]  They're total weirdos.  See, he's one of those dudes.  He's one of those guys.  It's kind of cool to be like that now, because that movie was huge.  All right, well, here's a little song for Ricky as we go to break.  It's our pal Stephen Lynch.  I came down to the breakfast table, felt like I could cry.  I tried so hard, but wasn't able to look you in the eye.  For I am feeling so much shame.  Yes, I have brought disgrace. 
[01:02:00]  I can tell I've soiled my good name by the look upon your face.  Well, it seems last night you caught me spanking it.  No use denying it.  Well, I was really cranking it.  It wasn't my fault, and it wouldn't be so bad if you could just forgive me and talk to me, Dad.  No, I didn't hear your intro. 
[01:02:30]  No, I didn't hear the door with my hand upon my member and my pants upon the floor.  Now, burnt into your brain is an image you despise,  like blood and guts and starving kids and Stevie Wonder's eyes.  Well, it seems last night you caught me spanking it.  No use denying it.  I was really cranking it.  Well, dry your eyes and don't be so sad, but I wouldn't use those tissues.  They've already been had.  Talk to me, Dad.  Yeah, the look upon your face made my swollen gland diminish. 
[01:03:00]  So I said, could you close the door?  I really want to finish.  Now, to Daddy, I'm ashamed and I completely understand.  If you never want to hug again or even shake my hand.  Well, it seems last night you caught me spanking it.  No use denying it.  Well, I was really cranking it.  Well, please calm down and don't get mad.  Just because it was your bed.  It's not that bad.  It's not that bad.  Not that bad. 
[01:03:30]  Talk to me, Dad.  When I was only 17, you told me it was dirty.  So it must be really creepy when your kid is pushing 30.  But you cannot tell me that you've never had a whack.  Had the thing that hangs below your belt and bumps it to your sack.  Well, it seems last night you caught me spanking it.  No use denying it.  Well, I was really cranking it.  Dry your eyes and don't be sad.  But I wouldn't use those tissues. 
[01:04:00]  They've already been it.  Just because it was your bed.  It's not that.  Rascals in West Orange tomorrow night.  Ocean Township on Friday.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I came up with something years ago.  Basically, it says,  We come out Wednesday.  Big, luscious, juicy ones.  Wow.  The swinging tribute to unrestrained female anatomy.  Wow.  It's Whip'em Out Wednesday.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:04:30]  All right.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony program.  Hey, it's Whip'em Out Wednesday, Anthony.  Whip'em Out.  Yeah, nice to Whip'em Out Wednesday weather.  Yeah, ladies, help us out.  Turn it down.  Bro, Nathaniel, you're killing me.  Ooh.  Thank you.  He's not usually at the helm over there.  I knew something was up.  Kirk beams down and leaves like Sulu at the helm. 
[01:05:00]  You know, he doesn't always get things right.  It's not like having Spock in there when he leaves.  A lot of people ask us about the WOW.  Well, ladies, if you see that WOW sticker  or the homemade WOW sign on the back of the cars and the trucks  or if you see the WOW written in the back of the trucks as well,  the big rigs.  Yeah.  Those guys support the show big time and they're hoping to see some boobs on the highway.  Right.  That's what Whip'em Out Wednesday is all about.  We have the official WOW stickers.  You can get them through our website, opieandanthony.com. 
[01:05:30]  Just send a self-addressed stamped envelope and we send the stickers right out to you  so you can play along.  It's really just a great, great thing because we have so many winners.  Most radio things that you hear about, you know, they get one or two winners.  This thing, thousands of people win every week.  Every week.  Every week I read the email from people getting WOW'd all over the country.  It's great.  It's great.  It's a great way to spice up your lousy commute.  And you know what?  I also get a lot of email from people going,  Hey, I haven't been WOW'd yet.  Well, we're now doing a national talk show.  So, I got to tell you, you know, the listenership is spread out all over the country. 
[01:06:00]  So, it's going to take a little more time than the old show.  The old show, we were concentrated in a bunch of cities like, you know,  New York, Philly, Washington, Boston.  So, the WOWing was just out of hand.  Absolutely out of hand.  But what I would suggest, you just throw the WOW on your car.  Almost forget about it.  It supports the show.  Shows everyone, you know, you're listening to us on XM Satellite Radio.  And then, guess what?  An extra bonus, you may see some boobs on the highway as you're driving around. 
[01:06:30]  Okay?  That's right.  But you got to be in it to win it.  Oh, my boy.  Yeah.  That's terrific.  Yeah.  That's terrific.  So, with that said, get a self-addressed.  Get a self-addressed.  Yeah.  Get a self-addressed.  Get a self-addressed.  Wow.  Get a self-addressed.  Get a self-addressed.  Get a get a get a.  An envelope that you address with your name on it.  Yeah.  Just send a self-addressed stamped envelope to us here in New York.  And we'll send out the WOW stickers.  Okay?  Right.  So, what do you guys think of the new pope? 
[01:07:00]  I think he was a good choice.  Yes.  Yeah.  What's the Nazi thing, though, really?  There's a little Nazi connection with him.  Because that's the big thing everyone's talking about, that he was involved with as a youth.  Well, when you hear that they elect or appoint or whatever the hell they do, a 78-year-old pope  from Germany, you got to think there's something going on back there.  Any German that's around that age, a little older, they have something going on as far  as the Nazi party went, as far as Nazi Germany goes. 
[01:07:30]  You know, they were there and perhaps they were involved.  They didn't know any better.  He was just the, he was, well, he wasn't that young, actually, if you think about it.  78, so.  He was pretty young.  Yeah.  Why's somebody so old?  That's the biggest issue.  What are the, it just goes to show you how out of touch the Catholic Church is, that instead  of appointing somebody, now the last pope there, John Paul, he was relatively speaking  a young pope.  Not relatively speaking. 
[01:08:00]  When he was brought in.  As far as the pope thing goes, he was extremely young.  He was 58.  He was the young.  58 for a pope.  He was the young pope.  Yep.  Traveling the world, what he did was he brought a lot of young people into the church, traveled  the globe.  He was constantly on the go.  Latin America, Asia, he was always traveling, getting flocks of people.  And now they appoint a pope who's, he's going to be another guy that's just going to be sitting  there, old, rickety, not being able to do anything. 
[01:08:30]  Drooling.  Yeah.  And he's completely conservative.  That's what the church wants.  They want somebody to kind of continue in the same vein as John Paul.  And I love it.  Instead of getting a younger guy in there that might actually bend a little bit.  Yeah.  Take, take, listen to people a little bit.  This guy, there's no talking to this guy.  Nope.  He is stuck in his ways and that is it.  And some of the, a lot of the people in the Catholic church, they love that.  They want that.  I love it too because I think they're becoming more and more irrelevant.  I love to see them taking the scandal and the beating and losing the property and having 
[01:09:00]  to sell shit and pay off lawsuits.  The more of that that happens to you, the happier I am.  So I'm glad they elected another out of touch ancient human being.  I was brought up Catholic and I will continue down the road of trying to find some other  form of spirituality.  Really?  Oh yeah.  I was born, born and raised Catholic and this guy, I'm a Catholic.  I'm not going to, you know, I'm not going to convert to anything.  But, you know, I, it's just disappointing that the church, uh, has no relevance. 
[01:09:30]  No, of course they don't.  They, they don't figure that a younger guy in there might be able to, uh, come up with  some better, newer ideas about the church.  The one thing that I can't get past, um, and this guy saying it, and he believes there's  only one religion.  He believes that it's, it's.  Well, that's pretty much the say.  I understand.  But church, I mean, stop.  Even, you know, even, uh, John Paul started acknowledging other religions.  He went into the, he went into the mosque.  He, you know, he, he did all sorts of things to kind of acknowledge other religions. 
[01:10:00]  And to honestly think that there's just, uh, one way of looking at this is just completely  ridiculous.  But the whole, dude, you gotta realize, you're, the faith itself is based on the fact that  it is the only religion.  Well.  If all of a sudden he goes, yeah, um, Buddhism, that's right too.  Uh, the Jews, they got it right.  It totally makes you, uh, I understand.  But that's why I'm not going to be a part of it.  You can acknowledge other religions, but you have to acknowledge them as, you guys, do what 
[01:10:30]  you're doing, but you're making a mistake here.  You know, we got the real God.  We got the Jesus, it's the, the way it's supposed to be.  Because if you start acknowledging that they're right, then your whole thing gets blown up.  Your whole spot gets blown up.  The Pope, of course, is supposed to say, Catholicism is the only religion.  It's the only true religion.  I feel, Anthony, that, um, something happened.  Yeah.  To, to, to give us all this.  Yeah.  But we just don't have the, uh, the exact description yet.  No?  Of what it was.  We don't have the wherewithal. 
[01:11:00]  You think it's a, a supreme being?  Ah, there was something that happened.  Or do you think it was just some kind of cosmic cataclysm?  There was a, there was a thing that happened.  A thing.  A thing.  Yeah.  So you think, but is it, is it a divine thing, or is it just some kind of mechanics of the,  the cosmos?  It was just a thing, and then there was a guy that kind of tried to describe the whole thing,  but he was like, whoa, hey.  Maybe he was a little tired when he was started writing, started, started, uh, writing all this  down.  Maybe he had a fight with his wife or something.  Well, I think he wasn't, he wasn't, something in the translation of divinity to the human 
[01:11:30]  writing.  Maybe.  I think you could lose something there.  Maybe he was going through a divorce or something, or maybe he was smoking some of that wacky  tobacco, and, and, you know, and he tried to write everything down as it was happening,  but he might have missed, missed a few things.  You think he missed a few details that were pretty key?  Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.  Yeah?  I don't know.  That's what I'm thinking, but something happened.  There's no...  There was a thing that happened.  He has a creepy smile.  Oh, he's just a creepy guy. 
[01:12:00]  He has a creepy smile.  He's cute as a button in the little Hitler youth uniform, though.  Look at the big picture there.  Oh, he sure was.  You want to give his little taxi cab door ears a pinch?  Don't you want to walk up to him?  Don't you want to see...  He's the perfect kid for Hitler to walk up to with his doddering, shaking hand, bend over  and pat him on the cheek for doing a good job?  That's right.  I wish I had ten generals like you.  As he goes back into his bunker.  Who's that smile remind you of? 
[01:12:30]  He's got like that, like, like an SNL character, that little, uh, half a smile.  Really bizarre.  Well, people have already done some, uh, photoshopping and some comparing, and here we  have a picture of the, uh, the emperor from Star Wars, and a picture of the Pope, and  he certainly looks like him.  It's kind of a separated at birth thing.  Separated at birth.  He really does look like him.  Yeah, a little bit.  Really?  Is that up on whackbag.com?  I'm sure it is. 
[01:13:00]  All right.  Watch your dumbbells all over, clapping for the new guy.  I just got almighty.  The older I get, the more I hate them.  Dude, we got audio of that.  Oh, really?  So what happens, I guess, at the Vatican, you know, the smoke comes out.  Yeah.  And this time around, it, uh, it was white, which means there's a new Pope that was elected.  Said it was done pretty quickly, as far as, uh, Pope choosing goes.  Yeah.  Oh, they, they all had their eyes on this guy.  It was very obvious.  And then, and then I guess they ring the bells, and then that's your, your sign, if, if you're 
[01:13:30]  one of these religious freaks, is start running.  Start running.  Start running?  Yeah, start running to the square.  Oh, oh.  Because he's going to be appearing for the first time.  Give the blessing.  And you don't know who it's going to be until he, he shows his face in the window.  Right, true.  And then you have people applauding because it was their guy that they were rooting for.  Yeah, I was betting on this guy.  It takes, it takes away from the whole thing.  Yeah.  Like I was saying yesterday, I think, uh, humans deciding who this guy is is kind of silly.  I think it's, it should have just been known. 
[01:14:00]  It's been done for hundreds and hundreds.  I know, but some, some, like, some, like, uh, superior being, being should have, uh, you  know, shined a light down on one of these guys.  Shined a light.  And said, there's no voting.  He's the guy.  Well, I guess, uh.  He's going to take the torch and continue running with this thing.  God delegates his responsibilities, too.  Comes down to a silly vote, though.  A silly vote and some smoke.  All the coronals get all, a ballot?  Yeah.  You get a ballot, they check it off.  Does anyone else find this kind of silly? 
[01:14:30]  The whole, any organized religion is silly if you look too deeply into it.  It's based on faith.  You have to take it at face value.  You have to read about it and accept the fact that this is true, regardless of how silly,  stupid, science fiction, fantasy, ridiculous it seems.  Your faith has to be so strong that you say, I'm not even going to acknowledge that this  is ridiculous.  I'm just going to believe.  That is religion. 
[01:15:00]  So you got to just suck it up and believe it.  But a ballot has decided that he's the descendant from the first guy, that, uh, the thing, right?  It's all in the cards.  The cardinals, they might not know this and check it off, but the divine intervention is  there, Opie.  Making the cardinals choose a certain person.  God works his will on these people.  He does that voodoo.  You know, we're before the strings.  One of the creepiest things since getting XM satellite radio when the Pope died. 
[01:15:30]  Was that creepy, getting XM satellite radio?  No, no, no.  Well, there was...  The way you put that was...  I know, I understand.  I'll explain, though.  When the Pope died, XM decided to air the Vatican channel.  I guess it was Vatican Radio or something.  Yeah.  On one of their channels for a couple days, I think.  And I was driving home from the beach on Long Island after seeing my sister and her kids.  And, uh, and it was like a nun with her, her, her little girls.  What are the little girls that hang out with the nuns?  Um. 
[01:16:00]  They were all reciting, uh, the rosary.  Yeah.  As robots.  Really?  It was creepy.  It was like listening in on a cult meeting.  Well, it is a cult.  By the definition of a cult.  It was all just monotone.  Catholic Church is a cult.  I would love to get that audio.  I have no idea how I could get it.  Any church is a cult.  But, dude, I was listening for 20 or 30 minutes, and then all of a sudden, I didn't know where I was driving to.  Wow, really?  Yeah, because I was like just...  See, that's freaky.  Right.  I was just all of a sudden mesmerized by, by the radio.  You got hypnotized.  And the droning of, uh, of, uh, the reciting of the rosary. 
[01:16:30]  It was really, really creepy.  It was like listening in on a horror movie, Anthony.  Yeah.  So, uh, we'll include...  Yeah, I know.  I don't think it...  I gotta get the archives of that channel, though, Eric.  And this guy joined Hitler Youth when he was 14.  I mean, you know, I don't think people knew what Monster Hitler was at that point.  So he'd probably say, hey, here's the new guy.  All right, look, let me put it in.  It's not a big deal.  Let me, uh...  Doesn't bode well with the Jews.  No, they're actually, they're like, yeah, it's no problem.  You really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You said it's fine?  They were all saying it.  He was part of...  He helped, uh, John Paul, uh, uh, denounce anti-Semitism. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, he's not anti-Semitism.  All right.  Just looks kind of cute in the little Hitler Youth uniform.  I heard...  I don't know.  Maybe I shouldn't say it.  Oh, go ahead, Opie.  What?  You gotta say it.  Opie's shy?  Someone, uh, called my cell phone with a little, uh, joke.  Ooh.  A joke?  Yeah, they, they knew that, uh, the new Pope was, uh, elected.  Uh-huh.  Because, I don't know, man.  Will this get me in trouble?  No, Opie, what happened?  They knew a new Pope was elected because, uh, an altar boy came running out into the square, 
[01:17:30]  uh, covered in, uh, you know what?  Um, oh, Jesus.  Yeah.  Who, who called you with that?  Some ass.  Oh.  Was it Kenny?  No, it was just some ass.  Pretty hot, actually.  But that's how they knew that there was a new Pope.  You know what?  According to this idiot.  You know what?  What?  How much?  Covered in what?  Um, uh, semen.  Strawberry jam?  Okay.  So, anyway, so then, uh, they ring the bell and, uh, and, uh, everyone, everyone comes 
[01:18:00]  running so they can get the first glimpse of the Pope.  Do we have that audio, Eric?  Let's go to that now.  Everyone is, I didn't hear.  Why is it in one channel?  Is that going to screw us up, one channel?  I bet some people aren't going to hear it.  Well, let's get it on a two channel, Hawk.  Is there any way to get it on a two channel there, Eric?  Put it in mono.  Was that our mistake, or is that...  Mono with mono.  Can you, can you, can you do the mono thing right in the dilette there?  Can't you have it come out in mono?  Eric's panicking.  Eric, figure it out.  You know what sucks about a week before the Pope died? 
[01:18:30]  Oh, dirt.  Someone probably told this guy to shut his fucking face.  You know, one of his cardinal friends who had no respect for him.  Like, look, douchebag, that's not the way we're doing it.  Yeah.  Now all of a sudden he's the new boss.  Now he's the boss.  The big guy.  The guy that wears the big hat.  Well, you got it?  Uh, they're trying to figure it out.  He's pressing buttons.  I'm sure he's going to screw something up.  Derek has no idea what he's pushing.  Well, he pushed a button on and then pushed it off.  Good job, Derek.  So they changed the board around.  Now it's different.  That's right.  This is not what I'm used to. 
[01:19:00]  All right, you guys figure that out.  I'll go to some other clips of the Pope day.  Yeah.  The Pope.  Big news, boy.  It just, uh, it was all over the papers.  The Daily News had a special Pope section.  I hate those things.  When they have the wraparound that's like five pages in the front.  And then you deal with that.  And then you get to the back, the sports page.  And you got to deal with it again.  See if we can get him on the air.  Yeah.  Get the Pope on the air.  Hey, Ben, get on the phone.  Book the Pope.  Maybe the booker will get the phone for it.  I'd love to get him in the studio.  Let's go to Paul on Long Island. 
[01:19:30]  Paul, what's up?  Yeah, it's like I was watching the goddamn Olympics.  You know, people with German flags, Italian flags.  I'm like, what the fuck's going on?  Pope won the Bob's fun race.  You know, I did see that.  Yeah.  The people that were German were just freaking out even more and waving their flags.  Because, yeah, it's a German.  Remember the Polish Pope?  It was all about Poland.  Yeah.  All about Poland.  Now it's all about Germany.  Yeah.  The Germans now have the Pope.  You want a black Pope?  Oh, more than anything.  He was one of the favorites, too, the black dude. 
[01:20:00]  He wasn't a favorite.  I think he was.  I don't know what they were talking about.  They were talking about him a lot.  Yeah, they were talking about him, all right.  Just to watch all these...  They were going to be Pope.  Just to watch all these idiots in Brooklyn.  Hey, what do you do now?  Oh, you got to put a picture of the Pope up somewhere in a restaurant.  He comes.  You got to chase him through Howard Beach.  Got him hit on the Belt Parkway.  All right, here's some audio.  Forgot your hat, moolie.  Stay out of our neighborhood, huh? 
[01:20:30]  You fucking moolie.  All right.  Here we go.  The new Pope announced.  The ringing went on for 10 minutes,  sending thousands running to the square  as the rain started to fall.  About an hour later, the announcement.  Cardinal Ratzinger.  More cheers as Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger of Germany  was announced as Pope Benedict XVI.  The crest of Pope John Paul II was unfurled in his honor.  Then Pope Benedict emerged, addressed the crowd, 
[01:21:00]  and offered a blessing.  A simple, humble worker in God's vineyard.  God has a vineyard?  Yeah.  The worker in God's vineyard.  That's nice.  We're all fucking grapes.  Isn't that wonderful?  That's what he's talking about.  We're all just grapes in his vineyard.  Some of us are the grapes that make the box of wine,  and some of us are the grapes that make the good stuff. 
[01:21:30]  The good stuff.  And then some of us are the grapes that get squashed on.  Some just fall off the vine and rot in the ground.  Wonderful.  A lot of people would accuse me of being sour grapes.  He he he he.  You are.  He he he he.  That's a good one.  All right.  Here's the background on the new Pope.  There's one thing in here that's going to set me off,  and Anthony and I were listening to this in the office.  Yeah.  And we're like, what?  Yeah.  What?  Irrelevant.  So who is Pope Benedict XVI?  Joseph Ratzinger's ferocious devotion to church doctrine 
[01:22:00]  earned him the nickname God's Rottweiler.  He served for over 20 years.  Whoa.  That's a tough name.  That's a guy I don't want to mess with.  God's Rottweiler.  You want that on the back of a leather jacket.  That's nice.  It's like in the back of a bomber jacket.  God's Rottweiler.  You can show like a Roddy growling with like a halo over his head.  I can see a logo already.  It will take seconds before someone gets that name for the whack bag message board.  Whack bag.  I want to see somebody out with Photoshop.  Put that together.  I want a logo for God's Rottweiler. 
[01:22:30]  I want the back of a jacket kind of art.  It's almost like nose art for a plane, too.  You could have that.  God's Rottweiler.  Her.  And then there's a picture of the Jews as God's fire hydrant.  Wow.  Awful name.  God's Rottweiler.  Isn't God all about love and stuff?  No, this guy's about kicking ass.  This is an ass-kicking pope.  He's 78 years old.  Stop it.  God's poodle.  God's old, blind chihuahua.  God's dog from Of Mice and Men. 
[01:23:00]  Oh, just mangy.  God's mangy mutt.  He's not God's Rottweiler.  He's like that dog that has to wear the lampshade.  The lampshade around its head, the funnel, so it doesn't scratch its sores.  He's 78.  He's 78.  What kind of Rottweiler is this guy?  It's a good thing he's not God's German shepherd to be chasing black people in 1965 all through Selma.  God's fire hose.  So many people were not happy that the pope was 84 years old.  This guy's only six years younger than the pope.  Six years younger than the dead pope. 
[01:23:30]  The dead pope there.  So what were they thinking?  They don't want him for a long time, dude.  They don't want another long-timer.  Oh, very good.  They don't want another long-timer.  You're right, because I'm paying attention to this story.  He's like what they call one of those transitional popes, Anthony.  Really?  Yeah, because they like what Pope John Paul did, and this guy is very similar to him.  So they want to kind of continue that for a little while.  Until they can find a real pope?  Until they can figure out the next step for the church.  Knowing that he's just going to drop dead at some point.  Maybe they want to segue into a more moderate guy. 
[01:24:00]  Maybe this guy's a bridge, and maybe they didn't want to go from black to white.  So they're going maybe with a guy who's more conservative but won't be there for that long.  So you don't make the connection of John Paul, who everybody loved, to a new whatever.  Who cares?  That makes sense, too.  Irrelevant creeps.  Wait, who was the last pope?  John Paul.  Oh, okay.  You didn't know his name?  Forgot already.  I'm just saying.  Can't this guy be John Paul III and keep it simple?  No, it's Benedict there.  Benedict XVI?  The XVI.  Jesus, how unpleasant is that? 
[01:24:30]  I don't know.  If you think your life is important, please, stop.  None of our lives are important.  John Paul did all this stuff.  He held that thing for 26 years.  They hosed down the Vatican and the square, and people are already just moving on.  Cheering for Benedict.  Cheering for the new guy.  Right.  All right, here we go.  Back to the audio here.  So I'm going to say an Arati's called a hellhound.  Is that true?  Oh, a hellhound.  I don't know.  God's hellhound. 
[01:25:00]  I don't know.  All right.  So who was Pope Benedict XVI?  Joseph Ratzinger's ferocious devotion to church doctrine earned him the nickname God's Rottweiler.  He served for over 20 years as chief theological advisor to Pope John Paul II, and the two were close friends.  Personally, he's regarded as humble and charming, a conservative intellectual.  Humble and lovable.  Here comes the good stuff.  Someone said, um, God's Rottweiler, will Opie be kicking the Pope in the liver? 
[01:25:30]  Redding from Whackbag.  Very good.  But in matters of doctrine, he is known as Cardinal No.  No to ordained women.  No to married priests.  No to homosexuality.  No to rock music.  That's where I'm like, what?  There's a red flag.  What?  He sounds like that David Spade commercial.  No.  Just say no.  Just say no.  Home no.  See, that's homo.  Oh, that's pretty funny.  Home no.  Child molesters. 
[01:26:00]  All that other stuff I have no problem with.  But I want my rock and roll.  Right.  And where does it say in the Bible, in any religious writings, that this guy is supposed to keep, you know, close to his heart and tell the people?  Where does it say rock music is a bad thing?  Where the hell does it say that?  Heck.  Where the heck does it say that?  Because they're saying he's a...  H-G double hockey sticks.  Because they're saying he's staying close to the gospel and all that. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's one of those guys.  But there was no rock and roll back then.  Rock and roll.  And what's the definition of rock?  Yeah.  He calls it the music of anti-religion.  All rock?  Yeah.  All rock music.  He does not like it.  I don't like it.  He's one of those stuffy old...  He's your grandfather.  He's someone's old grandfather that wears the Pope uniform.  He doesn't understand anything new. 
[01:27:00]  They try to make it sound like he was a new kind of modern guy because it's like he even has a fan site on the internet.  Do you think this guy has a clue what the internet is?  Do you think he has a clue what computers are that people have them in their home that it opens up information to people around the world?  So what happens if you like rock?  What happens if you're a U2 fan?  You'll burn in hell.  You're going to burn in hell.  That's just wonderful.  That's what's going to happen to you.  What kind of fan site could he have?  What kind of nerds belong to this?  I know. 
[01:27:30]  I'm going to go to the Cardinal fan site.  I'll talk to you later.  I want to post.  You know, his blessing today kind of sucked.  The first hour of his blessing was kind of cool.  But then it was downhill from there.  I think the Pope's losing it.  Yeah.  The Pope used to be hilarious.  But now he just sucks.  He's always bitching about the Vatican and how nothing works around the Vatican.  I just want the Pope to get back to blessing stuff instead of bitching about what the Vatican is. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, God.  Is the Pope going to turn down the Catholic?  Oh!  Thank you.  I saw in your eyes, too.  You had so much confidence.  Damn it!  I knew it was going to be good.  I had to say, I had to say, I had to say tone down.  Yeah, well, there goes that bit.  Yeah, the Pope's toning down his, uh, Pope's toning down his sermons.  I think the Vatican's getting on him.  You know, the Pope used to have balls and he said what he meant.  I hate when he always has that one cardinal and he wrecks the flow. 
[01:28:30]  Fucking assholes.  The old Pope was so much funnier.  The old Pope.  I used to love listening to him.  This new Pope stinks.  I think he's failing.  This guy's just a John Paul clone.  You know, us here on PopeBag.com. 
[01:29:00]  Hey, Anthony, I got audio of a cardinal talking about another religion.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, that should be interesting.  Ooh.  Unleashing some of the beast.  Fuck this one, Jimmy.  I got a little more here.  Cardinal Ratzinger is the first German Pope in almost a millennium.  He turned 78 years old on Saturday.  He has no history of chronic health problems, but we have learned he's been hospitalized twice 
[01:29:30]  since the early 90s, one after a nasty fall and once after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage.  Jesus.  That's a major problem.  That's a minor thing.  Those are minor things.  He's already falling down.  Brain hemorrhage.  He falls down.  The old people falling is like young people getting the hiv.  For the most part, the average person falls down a lot in their 20s because they get drunk  a lot.  And then you go many years without falling. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah.  And then you start falling again.  That's the end.  It's over, Johnny.  It is over, Johnny.  When you start falling.  When you're falling in your 70s, oh, the writing's on the wall.  Jesus.  You might have that occasional weird trip thing because, whoa, hey, I didn't see that pothole.  When you're in your 20s in fall, though, you get up, you go, oh, boy.  Your biggest concern is that you look like a dick falling down in front of people.  When you're that old and you got that old, old saltine hips working for you, it's over. 
[01:30:30]  You fall on that hip, you see a hip come apart like that.  Holy shit.  Someone's suggesting that we attack the Pope's website.  I am speaking.  Why would you want to attack the Pope's website?  Stop it.  And don't try to read into what I'm about to say.  Trust me.  Do not.  Oh, right.  Do not.  Okay.  Attack.  Please.  What are you saying, Opie?  Only nice posts?  No.  No, I'm not.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Hey, I'm going on record and saying no effing way. 
[01:31:00]  By the way, the Pope's website is eatawayfer.com.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Right.  Don't.  No screen names like.  No.  Shut up.  No.  Leave the Pope stuff alone, please.  Of course.  You can't attack the O&A rule, Pope.  Although there are a lot of cameras set up today at St. Pat's.  They're doing a lot of live shots from St. Pat's because they got a new Pope.  Yeah.  What?  You can't send people down with signs in front of the reporter? 
[01:31:30]  Why not?  The reporter.  Not in St. Pat's.  I'm talking about on, what is that, Fifth?  It's the stupid reporters.  It's the reporters.  If you're seeing a live shot going on, what the hell?  Dude, this is only going to be funny for us, but we watch a lot of the news.  News channels in the morning.  We tape a lot of stuff.  And there was a reporter on one of these news stations that had the worst hairdo ever.  We watched it five times and just openly laughed and mocked her.  Where's the hair?  It was like a weird comb over, but she had a full head of hair. 
[01:32:00]  She had a full head of hair, but the top was bubbled.  It was almost like the Great Gazoo on the Flintstones.  It was like a dome kind of comb over thing she had going.  Do we have a picture of her?  That's really odd.  I don't think so.  Yeah, we could probably get it.  Hey, did we talk about the assault on the media that we got at the ship?  Not yet.  That was nice.  Yeah, we'll get to that in a second.  I just want to get to this last audio clip.  Well, President Bush says the Catholic Church will be well served by its new pope.  He described Cardinal Ratzinger as a gentleman and a scholar. 
[01:32:30]  He's a man of great wisdom and knowledge.  He's a man who serves the Lord.  The President says he and the First Lady were impressed by Ratzinger's homily during the funeral for Pope John Paul II.  He said they would pray for his continued strength and wisdom.  Boy, Bush really went out on a limb there.  He has wisdom and knowledge.  Yeah.  Way to bring something new to the table.  He's a man who serves the Lord. 
[01:33:00]  He wears a big hat.  Yes.  Very good.  That's right.  He likes wearing robes.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  He's a man who does not consort with prostitutes.  Right.  Very good.  All right, we got that audio fixed.  Here's the bell ringing, and then people just losing their minds, I think, in this clip.  Listen to this.  Everyone is, as you can hear, cheering.  Thank you, suck.  Thank you, suck.  From the United States.  You guys, are you back here?  Are you convinced that we have an...  There it is.  Yeah, we can see the bell now, Chris. 
[01:33:30]  Here it goes.  We have a Pope.  We got us a Pope.  Ladies and gentlemen, the Beatles.  What's that cheering?  We got us a Pope.  We got us a Pope.  Hey, mamma mia.  I thought that was audio from, like, a soccer game, like World Cup or something.  Like a rock show.  Wait till you hear the bell ring.  The Pope goes down.  The Pope goes down.  That's one of my favorite sports moments ever. 
[01:34:00]  There is smoke.  There's a bell.  He's a Pope.  The Pope has been selected.  The Pope has been selected.  You beat me to it.  I was going to go, the Germans win.  The Germans win.  I hate that, by the way.  It's the Yankee announcer on radio, right?  So the rest of the country has no idea.  He loved John Sterling, but he became a parody of himself.  This ass. 
[01:34:30]  You know, he once, I guess, maybe as a goof said, the Yankees win.  The Yankees.  So now every time the Yankees win, he has to do this stupid thing.  It's interesting when it will be an exciting win, and John Sterling would do that.  The Yankees, it made you feel good, but now it's become this catchphrase.  A stupid stop with your catchphrases.  Yeah, the Yankees won 18-2 the other day, or whatever the score was, and he's still screaming like,  like it's a big deal.  Like they won in the bottom of the ninth, a walk-off homer, you know?  No, dude, it was 18-4. 
[01:35:00]  Let's relax.  You could just say, oh, wow.  Yeah, they won.  Do you know what he would say when Tino Martinez would hit a home run?  It would make my back hurt.  He would say, bam, Tino, instead of the bambino.  Oh.  And you want to get nauseous.  Oh, I am, thank you.  Wait, what else would he say?  Whenever Bernie Williams hits a home run, he yells, Bernie goes boom.  I want to bite his fingers.  Well, no shit. 
[01:35:30]  Sorry.  No shit.  That's become one of my favorite clips.  I love that one.  And then he'll throw another one in.  Bernie goes boom.  Burn, baby, burn.  What have we got here, a fucking comedian?  It is unlistenable.  Yeah, I hate those cliches.  I only, it's, what else would he do?  Oh, if two guys hit a home run back-to-back, he would go, um, wait.  Uh, they hit a home run, a back-to-back, and a belly-to-belly. 
[01:36:00]  What?  Back-to-back, and a belly-to-belly.  Or belly-to-belly and back-to-back.  Mm-hmm.  It's all fucking catchphrases.  I can't even listen.  I used to love John Sterling, because I think he does a very interesting call, like a regular  game call.  I like listening to him.  Yeah.  But he has become this awful, awful parody of himself, and it's embarrassing.  You have a problem with the entire Yankee picture.  Yeah, I do.  Yeah, I understand. 
[01:36:30]  I'm old school with the Yankees.  I like them.  I like young talent.  I'm sorry.  You know, those cliches and catchphrases at first were kind of cool, you know, but now  ESPN, it's so hard to watch SportsCenter.  It's all about, you know, these wacky calls and stuff.  Could go all the way.  All right.  Could go all the way.  Well, no, he was shut up.  No, no, no.  See, he's talking about Berman, and you're talking about Cassell, and Cassell's famous one was,  look at that monkey run, or whatever he said.  Look at that monkey run.  Do we have that?  But that was only something he said in a moment. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, but that was nothing.  And it wasn't racist.  He was calling other people monkey, too.  He used to use that all the time.  White guys, too?  Yeah.  Yeah, it was just a thing.  How is it a racist?  Oh, yeah.  I'm trying to think of more John Sterling.  First of all, he is a racist.  I think every single person has some racism in him.  I don't.  Oh, without a doubt.  Every person has racism in him.  That's true.  And every person has a little hypocrisy in him.  Yes.  It's not true.  Oh, without a doubt.  I happen to put out a doubt in my mind.  I don't dislike other races. 
[01:37:30]  I just like white people more.  There you go.  Some people's racism comes out a little louder, but in general, we're all racist.  I don't call it racism.  I call it human nature.  This is human nature.  It's in the animal kingdom.  Your lions, they hang out with the lions.  That's right.  Your zebras, they hang out with the zebras.  Well.  We, as human beings, are more comfortable hanging out with our own kind.  You're wrong.  No one likes the zebras. 
[01:38:00]  Part white, part black.  That's why the lions just rip their throats out.  That's right.  They attack carcasses wide open on the plains of the Serengeti.  The lions in their black boots just attack the poor zebras trying to eat and enjoy their lives peacefully.  Just trying to eat.  Asshole lions aren't even hungry.  Just attack them.  I like crocodile footage myself on the zebra or one of those big water buffalo goes to the lake.  Yeah.  And they're kind of looking around.  They get those huge eyes and they're going, huh, what, what?  And they go to take the drink. 
[01:38:30]  And they're looking for like a lion or something to come out from behind them.  So they're constantly craning their neck around, looking, looking, out of nowhere.  What?  The crocodile grabs his face and pulls him in and spins around and rips his head off.  And you've got to laugh.  You've got to laugh at nature.  Because that's what it's all about.  You're getting a drink.  You're looking behind you.  You don't want to get fucked in the ass.  And a crocodile grabs your face.  Welcome to life.  That's the problem with humans.  We just continue to try to go against nature. 
[01:39:00]  We're going to lose that game.  Basic human nature.  We're going to lose that game in the end.  Political correctness can stop what is basic human nature.  We are still, in essence, animals.  We try to put rules on ourselves to try to make ourselves seem better than just being animals.  We're pretty cool animals being able to use our brains like we do.  And when you look at everything that we've built and figure that we've pulled raw materials out of the earth and reformed it to make buildings and cars, that's pretty goddamn cool. 
[01:39:30]  That's because we're from another planet.  Yeah, but some people say that.  We came here on a spaceship.  It's very obvious.  You're insane.  It's very obvious to me.  I watched the History Channel, the Discovery Channel.  There's some runways and stuff there from the olden days.  And then the cavemen with the spaceship drawings and stuff.  We're spacemen.  Are you saying a lot of things in the Bible where people speculate were actually spaceships, like the Chariot of Fire? 
[01:40:00]  Yes.  That was in the air?  I have no doubt in my mind.  I have no doubt in my mind.  We're from another planet.  We came here on a spaceship.  And that's why we're very uncomfortable because this is not really our environment.  What is?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Rigel 7?  We came from another planet that was far more advanced than this silly, silly planet.  Triskelion?  Dude, because why isn't there just another form of life that's...  Seti Alpha 6? 
[01:40:30]  A lot of people say that we were actually an alien experiment, kind of put here like plants to see what would happen.  Why?  Yeah, that's what I think.  This is Seti Alpha 6!  Why isn't there just another form of something that's just a little bit stupider than us?  There is.  What?  Gorillas.  No, there's a big drop.  Gorillas are pretty stupid on the whole line down from us.  All right, why is there another form of something jumping on the bus with us after work? 
[01:41:00]  Just some other animal that knows enough to pay, get on, and take public transportation.  That's all I'm saying.  You know, you bring up a moronic but brilliant point.  That's all I'm saying.  There should be some other species of creature that can at least use what we've made.  They don't have to be smart enough to make it.  Right.  But if a gorilla decides he wants to go from point A to point B, he should be smart enough  to take his toll money and pay it.  That's all I'm saying.  His fare and use our transportation.  That happens all the time.  Have you taken certain buses? 
[01:41:30]  All right.  All right.  Jesus.  You know what radio show is?  A radio show got fired for that exact bit.  Of course they did.  The gorilla riding the bus bit up in Boston.  Oh, I didn't hear that.  They didn't get fired, but there was a gorilla loose in the zoo, and it would just happen  to be found at a bus stop and sitting at a bus stop.  And maybe, hey, see what happens when they try to use the bus?  We bring them back to the fucking zoo.  And there were some jokes that were made.  Let's just keep it at that.  Certain lines at the bus. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah, he said he was waiting for, the DJ said that the gorilla was waiting for a certain  bus line that is known to be just the minorities going to maybe Roxbury.  Yeah, going to Roxbury.  All right.  And he got reprimanded.  Well, that's why they're looking for the missing link.  Let me just go back to his point.  I'm not, there's just a drastic drop off.  Like, to even make something like our primitive tools, like a little tomahawk.  Remember, hundreds of thousands of years ago, when we were still cavemen, we were making 
[01:42:30]  tools out of rocks.  They would take a stick and some obsidian and put them together and make like a hatchet or  a spear, something like that.  Where is another animal that is getting up to that point where they're making these things?  Exactly.  We've all seen the chimp use the stick to get the ants out of the hole.  Right, right, right.  No, this is...  That's pretty much it, a stick.  Yeah, they have an advance past that where they go, hey, I'm going to go, you know what?  I've been watching these humans a little bit.  I think I'm going to go to Home Depot and just drag some pieces of wood out and see what 
[01:43:00]  I could do with the wood.  Well, I'm glad they've built all this because now I don't have to be smart enough to build  it all, but I can use it by gum.  Why can't you go through Central Park and all of a sudden see some kind of animal that  is attempting at least to duplicate what we've done?  Yeah.  There's buildings all around.  Build something.  There's a drastic drop off and that's where I have a problem when I smoke my weed and lay  around at night.  I'm not smoking the weed yet, by the way.  What you see is intelligence, though, but maybe because we have to have that.  For instance, there are insects that leap 30 times their own body height. 
[01:43:30]  We can't do that.  Chameleons change color.  Owls have things in the back of their head so it looks like they're looking all the way.  These are all natural things that their body does.  That's all this is.  How about taking natural resources from your surroundings, converting them into conveniences  for yourself?  That's born from a natural thing, which is a function of your brain.  It's all born from a natural evolutionary thing in your brain.  And for them, their body changes physically.  Admit that only the simians have the divine spa. 
[01:44:00]  Come on, Caleb.  Why haven't the squirrels organized and attempted one attack on us?  The squirrels?  Well, slow down.  I don't think they're ready for an attack.  I don't think any species is ready to mount an attack against these humans.  That's what I'm saying, though.  That's where I have the problem in all this crap, that there's a drastic drop off.  There really is.  I agree with Opie on this one, Jimmy.  All the other animals, if you really think about it, they sort of live together in this  kind of nice way.  Not nice, but there's predators and there's prey.  It's the circle of life. 
[01:44:30]  They got this whole thing going on.  And then it's stupid humans messing it all up.  It's not messing it up.  I think we do a pretty good job.  But we do convert where we live to be our convenience.  There's no other animal on Earth that represents like the humans.  You can go to every corner of the globe now and there is human representation.  We don't have to to survive.  We've done it in the past where we just use very simple, archaic tools and use our natural  surroundings to survive. 
[01:45:00]  We now take our natural surroundings and convert them into completely different things.  Like flying.  Yeah, right, right, right.  Yeah, you look at a 747.  It's a miracle of modern technology.  And every piece of it came out of the ground or the oceans or the atmosphere.  Nothing was made like that.  And you were able to build it and fly in it.  And there's a huge drop off, you're right, about intelligence between people and apes.  What I'm saying is the difference between us and gorillas is not as much as, say, a gorilla  and an amoeba or that form of life, that form of thing. 
[01:45:30]  You know what I mean, there's not that big of an intelligence difference when you compare  that to a basic piece of bacteria.  Look, look, look.  Ain't even trying it.  Look, look.  Yeah, exactly.  The gorillas have seen the freaking planes in the sky.  Why not for a good girl?  I'm going to see if I can get on one of those things.  They don't even look up at it.  See where it takes me.  They don't even look up at it.  I understand what Jimmy's saying.  They don't look and go, wow, that's pretty cool, and watch it fly by.  The intelligence thing.  They do.  The intelligence.  I've talked to them.  The intelligence thing goes like this, slowly goes down, down, down, down, down, all the 
[01:46:00]  way to the amoeba.  That's how I look at it.  But the problem is humans are at the top.  It's a big step.  Then it's a big step down, and then a slow, gradual all the way down.  All the other animals.  That's all I'm saying.  They have varying intelligence and potential, but it's like a wedge.  Right.  It's a slow climb from the stupidest of little one-celled creature to the gorilla or the dolphin,  some people say.  And then at the top of that wedge, there's a sheer wall that goes up to humans. 
[01:46:30]  That's what they're saying about the missing link.  Is there a link that's a little bit closer between the two of us that just didn't make it?  Bigfoot.  Bigfoot.  There ain't no Bigfoot.  I don't want to hold out hope there's Bigfoot.  No, there's not.  That was my thing growing up.  A man said he did those, for years he did those tracks.  It was a hoax.  A lot of them are hoaxes.  Some of the most famous ones have been confessed as hoaxes.  Yeah.  As was the Loch Ness Monster photo, that famous silhouette.  Yes.  Don't wreck my buzz.  Deathbed.  Don't wreck my buzz.  Surgeon's photo. 
[01:47:00]  I love the In Search Of stuff.  I don't think, I think it was just something that happened that somehow we got this intelligence  and, you know, rule the planet.  Nah.  That's pretty much it.  I don't think we came from anywhere else.  Nah, we come from somewhere else.  It was just the way things happen here on Earth.  To think this is the only place with stuff on it that's doing things.  No, I'm thinking there's other places with stuff on it.  And it doesn't even have to be similar to Earth.  I just think this type of life, human life, is on this planet because of the way things worked out. 
[01:47:30]  We are the perfect kind of life form for where our planet is in the solar system, its atmosphere, its amount of water to land.  Like, everything that makes Earth what it is contributed to why we are the way we are, why we have two eyes, why our noses are like this.  You know, if it was any different, I don't think life couldn't exist, but it wouldn't look like us.  And it would just be something else.  Just think of your everyday life. 
[01:48:00]  Like, when I go skiing, why not one other type of thing attempting it?  You want to see like a moose?  Something.  Wow, that looks like fun.  Some skis on going, I've been watching these bastards do this forever.  Maybe not even the skis.  Just going, hey, wow, look at what they're doing.  I want to try that somehow.  Yeah.  Nothing.  Nothing.  You'd get nothing out of these creatures, these stupid animals.  Some mooses are dumb.  They really are stupid.  The best, though, example going all the way back to the bus.  That makes me laugh.  The bus.  They're right there. 
[01:48:30]  Why not?  You want to go point A to point B.  It's a very convenient way to do it.  I don't know, though.  I've seen spiders in my car.  Well.  Now Jimmy brings up a good point.  Did he do that on purpose?  Maybe they've tried to do that, and they keep getting squashed, and they're like, fuck this shit.  Let's just walk.  Every time I try to hitch a ride, somebody steps on me.  Someone bruins the whole thing for me.  You ever have a mouse?  The mouse comes in, he finds free food.  He's like, ah, this asshole's got the whole setup.  What do you do?  You put down glue, and you starve him, and step on him. 
[01:49:00]  Maybe his friend saw that and said, look, fuck this.  Let's hang outside in the trash.  Another good point by Jimmy Norton.  Maybe they are learning.  I like that.  When they interact with man, there's always a problem for them.  I still think cats are aliens.  Asians are part aliens.  Asians.  Yeah, and the frogs are disappearing.  Someone has to look into that.  Thank you.  The frogs.  Yeah, the frogs, that's a weird creature, too.  And they're disappearing.  I think they're being called back home.  Well, I think that's the question.  They're being called back home.  A lot of people said-  No, natural habitat is being-  No, they're disappearing. 
[01:49:30]  No.  They're disappearing drastically, and someone needs to look into it.  Frogs.  And amphibians are very touchy.  They're not happy with something down here.  It's a very specialized habitat for them.  They're going back.  You think so?  Yeah.  Someone needs to look into the frogs disappearing.  Frog.  Frog.  Yes.  I'm telling you.  Well, a lot of people say that the frogs are not disappearing.  It was a big hoax, and that they're all just living somewhere, like on a beach or on some  kind of a resort.  But that that whole thing where the frogs being murdered was just never happened. 
[01:50:00]  There's someone out there that'll help me with the frog theory.  I gotta say, this conversation is perfect for the date, which is 420.  It was a big hoax, and this guy, I'm sure there were people smoking pot just glued to  their radio going, yeah, I've been saying this for years.  You're stoned.  Don't worry about it.  Why not one other creature checking out a baseball game?  They do.  Yeah, last time that happened, a bird flew down, Winfield hit a baseball into it.  Why should they go there? 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, but fair.  That kid hit all the time.  That poor girl died at a hockey game, but people are still going to a hockey game.  Because we're dumb.  Birds are smart.  One bird gets it, they're like, fuck, this game stinks.  So I fought back.  Why not?  Talk to the bird that stepped in front of the big unit's pitch.  Yeah, absolutely.  That was a good one, too.  He just can't want to watch the game.  Poof!  Maybe the bird's trying to enjoy the game, and Giambi hits a home run, and they have  to hear John Sterling go, the Giambito!  And the bird flies away and says, I'd rather be electrocuted on a wire than hear this hack. 
[01:51:00]  Why not one cheetah entering the Olympics?  One cheetah?  Yeah.  I don't think they're allowed.  The fastest human alive and stuff like that.  You've got to think the cheetah's looking on that going, oh my god, that's a joke.  Because the cheetahs catch these fast people over in Kenya and eat them.  It's no challenge for them.  The cheetahs aren't having fun unless they can eat you.  They laugh at the Olympics, if only they watched television.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They would laugh at that.  They think it stinks.  You know what they call joggers in Africa?  What?  Joggers.  Lion bait. 
[01:51:30]  Is this a real thing?  Yeah.  Better be.  Because it was going to get...  No!  Wow.  Lion bait.  It's lion bait.  Yeah.  Really.  Let's go to Mike in New York.  Mike?  Hey, Opie.  Hey.  Hey, what's up, man?  First of all, you've got an attitude problem, but that's different.  Okay.  Anyways.  Yeah.  If you tell me...  Let's explore this attitude problem.  What's my problem?  No, I just think you do. 
[01:52:00]  You're always angry.  I know.  He is, right?  Hold on.  Hold on.  I am so glad...  He's angry in the old days.  Yeah.  Thank you, Anthony.  Thank you for sticking up for me, and I didn't have to do it myself.  In the old days, if you're a real old listener to the show, I was a very, very, very angry, miserable person.  Anthony and I had a lot of success.  And I never really enjoyed it.  That's the fact.  My personal life sucked.  Our situation that we were in sucked.  And I just didn't enjoy it.  All that cool stuff you read about us, I never enjoyed it.  Here at XM Satellite Radio, I'm really, really enjoying myself. 
[01:52:30]  Okay?  And the only thing is I'm very passionate about what I do.  I'm giving you a serious answer, by the way.  And I just want things to work the way Anthony and I know it could work.  That's all.  That's the only problem I have now.  And that's, you know, shape management and shape.  Shape management and shape.  Get management and shape.  And make sure we have really good equipment and really good people around us.  That's it.  That's the only thing I have these days.  You know, I am having so much fun doing the show with these guys.  It's not even funny.  All right?  So there's the answer to that. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, you're a good guy.  No, I don't think.  Hold on.  I don't think I'm a good guy.  You're not.  No, I'm not.  No, what's funny, though, is that you guys, and not only you guys act like me.  It's funny.  It's like I got a piece of Anthony in my head.  Anthony in my head.  I got Norton in my head.  I got you in my head.  Half of me.  Even Ben, I herky and jerky.  I don't know.  Even Pat from Munaki.  Half of me is a good guy.  I really do have this whacked out psycho thing in my head. 
[01:53:30]  And I, whatever.  Go ahead.  What's your point, sir?  Anyways, the reason why I called in the first place is if you go on Google and you type in  Failure, and then you click I Feel Lucky or I'm Feeling Lucky, it comes up with George  Bush's bio.  Well, of course it does.  What do you expect?  I mean, somebody thought it would be kind of funny to do, and it is kind of cool.  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  And you have baloney boobs, too.  Mike, your new name for the show is The Cooler.  Thank you.  Jesus.  Terry in Georgia. 
[01:54:00]  Good morning, guys.  Hey.  Unlike the last dickhead that was just on, I don't think you have an attitude problem,  Opie.  I love you guys.  You're fucking hilarious.  Jimmy, you're The Cooler.  Oh, thank you, sir.  I appreciate that.  But let's ease up on the language.  I like listening to you guys every morning.  You make me laugh.  I don't think you have many listeners down here in Georgia, so I'm going to try to spread  the word for you with a little ONA sniper.  I'll have something for you next week to listen to, guys.  Thank you.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, Terry.  That's what Malvo and Muhammad were doing, by the way, trying to spread the word in D.C. 
[01:54:30]  I know.  They were shooting anyone without a wow sticker.  Right in Florida.  Get your wow sticker.  Hey, guys.  You're protected if you have the wow sticker.  Ryan, go ahead.  Now, are we the smarter of the creatures because we change our surroundings, or are we the  the last thing of the creatures because we're the only creatures that don't adapt to our  surroundings?  We adapt to it, but we do it brilliantly.  We take our surroundings.  Instead of taking wood and just using it in its natural form and making a hut out of 
[01:55:00]  it like we used to, we figured there are better ways to make planks of wood and then use wood  products to make other things, and we change it around.  You can take rocks and build a wall, or you can take the minerals out of the rocks and build  steel.  We don't adapt brilliantly, Anthony.  I think we do.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I've got to argue with Anthony.  We rarely argue on this show.  Watch this.  Watch this go down.  Point counterpoint.  Oh, guys.  Don't blow the gig.  Be friends.  We don't.  We don't.  Because just turn off the electricity and see what happens. 
[01:55:30]  Well, that's just it.  We don't turn off the electricity.  We will lose our effing minds.  Figure it out.  And we would not survive.  I think we would figure it out.  Hey, man, I agree to that.  Down in Florida with the hurricanes, power went off, and everybody went nuts.  There you go.  You go nuts for a little while.  And that was only for a couple of days.  It's inconvenient.  Yes.  There's generators.  There's other things for these small little pockets of power outages, and everyone's fine  about it.  How are the fat people going to get around without electricity, Anthony?  I don't know.  Why don't you answer that question?  What? 
[01:56:00]  You mean on the little rascal scooters?  They have all sorts of ways to get around.  They're going to have to either adapt, lose weight, or die.  By the way, the whole pollution thing and things coming from the ground, I don't worry  about pollution.  I don't either.  Because it all came from the ground and began with.  There it is.  When you change the form of certain things and pump it into the atmosphere, it does do  a little damage.  Certainly does.  But that's our ego is getting in the way.  I think you're right about that.  I think this planet is fine. 
[01:56:30]  And when we say we're destroying the planet, I think that's ridiculous.  And I think it's somebody that gives us a little too much credit.  And that Earth Day, is that coming soon?  They do it in spring?  I don't acknowledge it.  What a joke.  Yeah.  I remember being a kid at Washington Drive Elementary School there, Anthony, in Centerport,  Long Island.  And every Earth Day, we had to clean up the whole freaking playground.  Oh, they make you clean up.  Yeah, they put you on work detail.  I was smart back then.  I'm smart. 
[01:57:00]  I'm thinking, all right, we're cleaning up all this, quote, pollution, so they could  take all that pollution and then put it somewhere else.  They put it in a landfill.  Are we really cleaning up at that point?  You just move it around.  We're just moving it from one place to another.  We move it around to a place that's out of sight, out of mind kind of thing.  But it's still...  We're not cleaning anything up, really.  Unless you could take the actual pollution off the planet and throw it on another planet,  we're not really cleaning up.  Just shuffle it around a little bit.  Thank you.  That's all. 
[01:57:30]  Just wait till you see me on weed.  But long after we were gone from this planet, long after some cataclysmic event or our own  undoing eliminates human beings from this Earth, you know how quickly the planet would  recover from any damage we're doing to it?  Like people would go, we're damaging the rainforest and this, that, or the other thing.  It would take a matter of a few hundred years for everything to just be fine again.  Yeah, because all those seeds are still there. 
[01:58:00]  Oh, yeah.  Where'd they go?  The seeds are still there.  Oh, they're all still there.  We just kind of stomp them down.  That's all.  A sidewalk that hasn't been used, an abandoned sidewalk that hasn't been used for ten years  or something.  Some new roads put in.  The old one they just kind of put on the side.  It's gone.  Everyone clear out of Manhattan.  Trees growing through.  Everyone clear out of Manhattan and give it ten years.  You won't even recognize the place.  The place would look great.  Every street would have trees and bushes growing in them.  Yeah, the seeds are still there.  We just stomp them down every day.  Yeah, every day they're stomped down.  Vines crawling up the building. 
[01:58:30]  There's tiny little plants growing every day on the sidewalk.  We just stomp them down.  We just stomp them.  He's trying.  He's trying it.  The plant goes, oh, I just broke it.  And eventually, it'll grow again.  By the way, the electricity argument, Roman Empire.  Yeah.  No electricity.  No electricity there.  Seemed to do pretty well.  It did all right for a while.  Whole world.  We are very adaptive.  If something happened where we ran out of the fossil fuel, and I've gotten these people  that tell me that the fuel has 30 years left and it's running out. 
[01:59:00]  They've been saying that for years, too.  But if the fuel did run out and we couldn't make electricity the way we do now with fuel,  we'd figure something else out.  Adapt.  We'd figure something else out.  That's the beauty of the human being.  We've got everything under control.  Don't sweat it.  All right.  Ryan, anything else?  Yeah, man.  It's one more thing, and I know I'm going to get hammered for it, but here we go.  Oh, no, you won't.  It's their OB, and as for animals, you know, the beavers that dam up rivers to make lakes, 
[01:59:30]  man.  That's true.  The beaver dams up the river.  That's just more of an instinctive thing.  They can't comprehend why they're doing it.  And they're not doing it to be smartasses.  Yeah.  Like, I'm going to dam up this river.  Screw the people downstream.  Yeah.  A lot of people do things just so they don't die.  That's instinct.  I mean, I'm kind of going against my own earlier argument, but that's not really a sign of  intelligence.  Yeah.  You know, I mean, we do things to fly, to be convenient.  You know, you get your prostate checked as preventative medicine.  Yeah.  Human beings seem to be the only species on the planet that do things to make their life 
[02:00:00]  more convenient.  Like, monkeys don't look at other monkeys and then turn away when the other monkey looks  and then go jerk off thinking about the peak they got at the other monkey.  Right.  I don't think.  No.  I don't think so, either.  They'll just jerk off right at anything.  Elephants don't try to get other elephants to pass out so they can take pictures with  their elephant cocks by the passed out elephant's face.  You know, you bring up another good point.  Have you seen the clip on the news today?  The elephant is great.  What, it crashing through a bank or something?  Wait till you see this video later. 
[02:00:30]  Elephant crashes through a big plate glass window and he's in some kind of office setting  and he's just losing his elephant mind.  He doesn't know how to go, I'd like to make a deposit, please.  I'd like to deposit these peanuts.  These poor elephants that just finally snap and go, these motherfuckers.  Motherfuckers.  Right.  You motherfucker.  How did the discussion get from the Pope to life on Earth?  Well, don't worry.  That's the program, my friend.  We're under control.  We're going to bring it right back around.  But you were saying, what were you saying about the thing? 
[02:01:00]  Because I had something.  Oh, electricity?  No, after that.  Oh, I don't know.  It was something poignant.  Just before the elephants.  Beavers.  Oh, the thing with human beings, the other animals don't have this conscious awareness.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  The best thing we did as humans is put clothes on our body so we can get things done.  Yes.  Yes.  See, I think the first step, these other creatures, if they're listening in right now,  you've got to cover up.  Because their whole day is just getting late.  Yeah.  They're out of their minds.  Their genitals are exposed. 
[02:01:30]  Everyone's genitals are exposed.  Of course, that's all you're going to think about.  For these other creatures, cover up your little bully.  Do you think that would start the ball rolling for them?  That would start the ball rolling.  Start thinking about other things.  Yes.  Yes.  That's a good point, too.  A little clothes for squirrels will start the whole process.  Because then the other animals see the squirrels with clothes on and go,  Oh, hey, what's going on there?  Yes.  I'm being asked here, asked by Mr. Squidlow, Whackbag.  Professor Anthony, didn't Egypt have crude batteries? 
[02:02:00]  Hmm.  Yes, I do believe they would take some type of ceramic container,  and if you put a sliver of zinc and copper in there,  and then fill it with some kind of acid,  even fruit juice from the lemon or lime would be enough to actually produce an electrical current.  What they used it for back then?  I have no clue.  Maybe heat. 
[02:02:30]  Maybe you could put a little wire between the two and get some resistance.  But there were, yes, crude batteries made.  Forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates.  Here comes Professor Anthony.  Glad I could answer your question.  And by the way, it's a dumb question.  The batteries, what were they supposed to listen to music on if they didn't have batteries, sir?  For hundreds of years in Egypt, these dummies had Walkmans that no one could figure out.  They couldn't listen.  Their iPods were shit. 
[02:03:00]  Getting all mad because they couldn't transfer their Windows files to their iPod.  Their computers were good until they ran out once, and they had no electricity to recharge it.  They had to keep buying laptops.  Speaking of laptops, now we're really just, now the lead is really growing fast over everybody else  because we're in the computer age and they're not even the abacus.  You don't even see a monkey fiddling with those dopey Asian beads for the abacus.  You would think one of them would have had a calculator by now.  Something. 
[02:03:30]  Just something.  All right, let's get back to the Pope audio.  Yeah.  So the bells were ringing.  Loving the Pope.  This actually proves, by the way, that we're no better than anyone else.  We're a bunch of dopes.  Go all the way back there.  Go back, Hawk.  Because this was an hour ago.  We have a whole new audience.  Basically, this is audio of the bells ringing.  Somebody announcing that we have a new Pope like he's announcing a World Cup soccer game.  Yeah.  I'm prepared to hear, go!  The Pope wins the pennant! 
[02:04:00]  The Pope wins the pennant!  The Pope wins the pennant!  Cheering crowd.  Yeah, will this go down in history as one of those great, great broadcast moments?  I think so.  You know, when that thing crashed in Jersey there?  I forgot the name of the thing.  Oh, no!  Oh, this is the worst cadet I've ever seen!  Oh, get out of the way!  Oh!  Oh, the humanity!  There's a guy that was able to hold it together for his broadcast. 
[02:04:30]  I know.  Jesus.  Blubbering idiot.  He's supposed to be impartial.  Oh, the people!  Oh, they're running!  They're running on fire!  Oh, get out of the way!  Oh, Jesus Christ!  Oh, no!  He lost his mind!  It was your one moment in the sun.  Yeah.  There's your moment to shine.  Although that...  He was all professional for us.  Here comes the Hindenburg!  Yeah.  To Lakehurst, New Jersey, ready to dock at the...  Holy fuck!  Oh, my Jesus Christ! 
[02:05:00]  What the fuck?  Oh, it's blowing up!  This is a catastrophe!  Oh, my God!  Might have been someone smoking unlucky!  Set the whole thing off!  Oh, the humanity!  You know the guy wanted to curse his ass off.  Lost his mind.  You know he wanted to say, holy shit!  Of course he did!  He didn't want the FCC getting him, though.  Did anybody survive that one or no?  The Hindenburg crash?  Yeah, a few people.  They jumped and ran.  A lot of them ran out of the wreckage.  That, by the way, is what made that whole crash famous, is his call. 
[02:05:30]  I mean, the crash is famous enough, but his call, man...  Oh, his call.  ...is great.  No other radio disaster like that.  You don't hear...  Oh, they're having sex at three times!  Oh, this is the worst catastrophe I've ever seen!  Oh, people, run from the security!  Please run away!  Oh, no!  Jim Norton's personal appearance dates are crashing and burning!  Can I throw...  Oh, this big arena show has been done!  Oh, no!  Can I throw a possible bit at you?  Oh, uh...  Imagine if Ricky was the reporter down there in Jersey when the Hindenburg was crashing? 
[02:06:00]  Here, Lakehurst, New Jersey.  Here comes the Hindenburg.  Oh, it's on fire.  It's burning and crashing.  I don't...  What?  Oh, sorry.  I turned my mic off.  Some people are getting hurt or something.  Oh, there's a minute.  All right.  Very good.  Thank you.  All right.  Here's the Pope audio.  Listen to this guy just losing his mind. 
[02:06:30]  We're talking about a new Pope being elected.  That's the new Pope.  All right.  Hit it.  Everyone is, as you can hear, cheering, and, uh, I found some, uh, some police from the United States.  You guys, are you guys convinced that we have a new Pope?  There it is.  Yeah, we can see the bell now, Chris.  There it goes.  Peter King, we have a car.  We got a support.  Well, this is a truly electric moment.  It means...  No, Eric.  What you just saw were the bells of St. Peter's tolling, which are looking out of the excited faces of people in St. Peter's Square. 
[02:07:00]  The 115 Cardinals in the Roman Battle of the Church have chosen the 265th Pope in the history of the Church. 
[02:07:30]  Wow.  I got to tell you something.  Listening to that audio, that was the first time I got some goosebumps.  Oh, did you get a little goosebumps?  A little bit.  A little bit.  It's an electric moment.  There's a lot of energy there.  I like that.  I like, uh, feeling energy like that.  It's kind of like Times Square on New Year's Eve a little bit.  Oh, my gosh.  You know?  Yeah, they should have had Dick Clark there if he wasn't at home trying to figure out why one half of his face isn't working.  Remember when Dick Clark had his stroke and they said, uh, oh, he'll be there for New Year's Eve?  Yeah, yeah.  And then it was like, well, he's not quite going to be good enough for New Year's Eve.  We've got to have a regency in there. 
[02:08:00]  But he's fine.  Yeah.  And now you don't hear about him.  No one has seen him.  You'll never see, uh, Dick Clark.  You'll never see him again.  No.  They're going to have to elect a new Dick Clark.  All right.  Uh, let's go to Sean.  We've got Pope.  He sounds like Booger from, uh, Revenge of the Nerds.  We've got Pope.  We've got Pope.  Uh.  Uh, pullback Johnson from New Orleans.  Okay.  Benedict stole the ball.  Benedict stole the ball.  I think that's a Celtics call, right? 
[02:08:30]  Very fine.  Havlicek?  I couldn't tell you about basketball.  All right.  Sean in Jersey.  Yes.  Hey guys, you're talking about Jay Moore making the show ADD.  We've gone from the Pope to John Sterling's calls, water buffaloes getting their heads  ripped off, Egyptian batteries to Hindenburg.  God, we've got to come on crack.  We could actually go home.  We covered a lot of stuff today.  Covered everything.  Yeah.  Done.  Don't forget about other creatures, uh, attempting to, you know, go on a bus.  Ride the bus.  All right.  Ride the bus.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[02:09:00]  Punch it out.  All right.  Oh my God.  We have to try this.  God, why didn't we think of this?  I probably did.  John in, uh, New York City.  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  How cool would it be that after those bells ring, Angus Young would come in with that riff,  Hell's Bell.  Oh, nice.  We got, uh, ACDC.  Can you guys play that?  Yeah, ACDC, Hell's Bell.  Can you do two things at one time, Eric?  Oh, look at that.  And someone else saying, uh, Tim from Phoenix saying, sounds like the audio from a bootleg Metallica  concert, the beginning for, uh, for whom the bell tolls.  Oh, for whom the bell tolls can work, too. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Are we going to try this?  Uh-oh.  All right.  We got, uh, which one do we start with first, Anthony?  Do we do Hell's Bells or the Pope Bells ringing?  Whatever they feel comfortable with.  I want to hear both, though.  You want to go with, oh, Nathaniel, confident.  He wants the ACDC to start first.  Yeah, ACDC.  Look at him taking charge.  All right.  Hit the ACDC.  Now you hit the Pope, uh.  Everyone is, as you can hear, cheering.  And, uh, I got to the Pope from the United States. 
[02:10:00]  You guys, are you guys convinced that we have a new one?  There it is.  Yeah.  Oh, don't tell me.  Yeah, we can see the bell now, Chris.  There it goes.  Here it goes.  We have a card.  We got us a punch.  Rock and roll, baby!  Yeah, rock the punch!  What you just saw were the bells at St. Peter's tolling. 
[02:10:30]  What you're looking at are the excited faces of people in St. Peter's Square.  The 115 Cardinals in the World Cup entrance have chosen the 265th home in the history of  the church.  Oh, yeah!  Rock in the Vatican.  Hicked the post perfectly. 
[02:11:00]  Holy.  Good call by Nathaniel.  Wow.  He won an ACDC first, which made that timeout perfectly.  Okay.  I'm rolling thunder, pouring rain.  I'm coming round like a hurricane. 
[02:11:30]  My lightning's flashing across the sky.  You're only young, but you're gonna die.  Oh, I won't take no prisoners.  Watch me, no remains.  Nobody put in a number fight.  Oh, I got my bell.  I'm gonna take you to hell.  I'm gonna get you.  Sweet.  Get you.  I'll help me. 
[02:12:00]  I'll help me.  You got me.  I'll help me.  How many of you?  I'll help me.  I'll help you.  I'll help you.  I'll help you.  I'll help you.  I'll help you.  I'll help you.  You're a friend of mine. 
[02:12:30]  See my white light rushing as I step the night  Cause if you're down and left then I'm sticking through the rain  I won't take a business, won't spend no light  Nobody's putting up a fight  I got my bill, I'm gonna take you to hell  I'm gonna get you, see you, get you  I won't spend, I won't spend 
[02:13:00]  You got the ring, I won't spend  I'll turn it to hell, I won't spend  I won't spend  I won't spend  I won't spend 
[02:13:30]  I won't spend  I won't spend  I won't spend  I won't spend  I won't spend  I won't spend  I won't spend  I won't spend  I won't spend  I won't spend  I won't spend  I won't spend  I won't spend  I won't spend  I won't spend  Thank you. 
[02:14:00]  Thank you. 
[02:14:30]  Thank you. 
[02:15:00]  That's how I say it.  I mean, what about wow?  That's totally their idea.  Oh, there you go.  Okay.  There's something new.  Well, and then...  There's something new.  You know what?  I used to do that in Washington, D.C.  Tell them, Fred.  I used to have people tie bandanas around their cars so that women would take their clothes 
[02:15:30]  off in the cars.  Dude, get with it.  Give me an original idea.  Come on.  I mean, I know.  I used to have my listeners tie a bandana around their car.  I mean, I've done it all.  What about going off on...  I totally know that's you.  All right.  Okay.  Whatever.  I got to go.  Please.  I don't really want to get into a discussion like this.  He's so delusional.  That is really funny.  Someone found the clip.  Yeah, that's something we couldn't play on the old show because of the gag order that  he placed on us.  How do you tie a bandana around your car? 
[02:16:00]  That's a great one.  That's a big bandana.  What's the matter?  My car has cancer.  People throwing Frisbees to their cars.  Jump and grab it.  God, just showing your age, man.  You can't even tie bandanas to antennas anymore.  It's all hippied out.  You honk the horn.  Like, beep, beep.  Dude.  Oh, dude.  He's so delusional.  Oh, man.  Just admit it.  Wow is such an original idea. 
[02:16:30]  I invented everything.  I've done it all.  He even said, I've done it all.  Wow.  Even the stuff that's going to be invented, I did it all.  There's no real idea.  I went into a time machine and I already did it.  Killed himself.  I've done it all.  I was the first one to do anything.  Marconi ripped me off, Robin.  Remember, what was that thing called?  Dot, dot, dash, dash.  Dot, Morse code.  It was Howard code earlier.  The guy ripped me off.  I invented SOS.  Hoo, hoo, hoo, Robin. 
[02:17:00]  What a complete jackass.  He's the guy.  Wow.  Wow.  He invented wow.  And it had nothing to do with whip him out Wednesday.  Wow.  It was tying a bandana around your car.  Thank you, Howard.  And what were we supposed to do if you saw...  I don't know.  He didn't really explain it very well.  Of course he's not going to explain.  If someone had a bandana tied around their car somehow, girls would get naked in the car?  It wasn't even flat.  Yeah, girls would get naked. 
[02:17:30]  They're driving, taking their clothes off, crashing into a butt, Mr. Robin.  I invented traffic accidents.  A bandana around an antenna that reminds me of something else I've heard.  It's called a fucking flag.  That's not exactly somebody's fucking invention.  I invented that, Robin.  They say Betsy Ross did that.  I sewed the stars on.  Hoo, hoo, it was all me.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I honestly don't care.  I don't care.  I invented that.  I invented that.  All right. 
[02:18:00]  Getting some instant feedback here, Opie.  A couple of ass wipes on the board on the instant feedback.  Have to ruin it.  Ken Bernard from Philly.  Okay, tools.  We know the song enough. 
[02:18:30]  That's when we played Hell's Bells for the Pope?  Yeah, right before we took our break.  Stomach Pancake from New York City.  What's next?  A 40-minute Jim Brewer bit.  Nice five-minute time kill, asses.  And then we have a mobile device.  Some guy calling in, and I have his phone number right here.  The guy said the intro to the song.  Not a complete set for Pope Stock 2005, you lazy tools. 
[02:19:00]  Chris, are these three idiots are bashing us for playing one song?  Do you realize how long we were talking before we took that break?  I think it was about an hour and 15 minutes.  It was an hour and 15 minutes, and before that, we talked for another hour before that.  So we gave you pretty much what the normal terrestrial radio gives you in any given four-hour show in two hours.  Because we don't take breaks, and we just went on and on, and we talked, and we were having fun, we were taking calls, we were listening. 
[02:19:30]  And these scumbag ass fucks have to say, you lazy bat.  We give them an hour and 15 minutes straight without one break.  They're getting spoiled, I think.  They're getting spoiled, and you're going to pay for it now.  Right, Chris?  516-521.  No, don't do it, though.  Stop.  5.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, stop, dude. 
[02:20:00]  Don't do it, though.  I give out the rest, you son of a bitch.  516-521, what is that?  I don't know.  Listen.  It's not a Long Island.  I think people are getting spoiled, and what we need to do, get Ben and Eric to pile up 20 minutes of commercials.  Yeah, okay?  That'll train you idiots.  Right.  Like what it's like to listen to radio.  You want to hear one song, because all of a sudden, I'll tell you what happened.  We started the intro, and I was getting goosebumps, and I like ACDC, and it was making sense, and I'm like, well, we can break into it and talk a little more, go to break.  Or, you know what?  Wow, it's feeling good. 
[02:20:30]  Just play the song.  Let's just play it.  And go to break, take a piss.  Every once in a while, we play a song if it really, really makes sense.  That's all that's about.  But these douche satchels.  What assholes.  Not enough.  We didn't give them enough.  An hour and 15 minutes for one entire segment wasn't enough, Opie.  We should have talked for also the length of time of that song.  See, we didn't give them enough.  What's a douche satchel?  Douche satchel?  Yeah.  That is the sack that the douche fluid is contained in before you ram it up some stank hole and squeeze to clean out that gash. 
[02:21:00]  That's what they need.  Unbelievable.  Not enough.  Yeah.  Nice five-minute time kill asses.  That's a great one.  Not the whole song.  Come on, dude.  Ken Bernard.  K Bernard at.  All right.  What?  If you dish it out, you got to take it a little bit.  Ass heads. 
[02:21:30]  You know what I love about this?  What?  We just wasted another three minutes commenting about people.  Yep.  That's how we said we were wasting time.  Let's go to break.  You see how brilliant we are?  Jerk off.  I like to point out our brilliance sometimes.  That's it.  Now we should do 20-minute segments and then break and do at least 10, 15 minutes of commercials.  Dude, here's Michael from Denver.  Oh, my God.  That Pope ACDC mashup is the coolest fucking thing.  There you go.  You got a little ACDC.  It almost makes me want to be Catholic. 
[02:22:00]  Unbelievable.  And now they're saying that Nathaniel should be hired permanently for the perfect mix job on that song.  Who signed that?  N from New York.  Danny, you better work on something immediately.  What's Derek doing back?  He looks so awkward back there.  Derek was hired by the company, so he can now relax a little bit.  Now he's not doing anything.  For the new listeners, we got three guys all jockeying for position.  Then you got guys like Ricky that will never even give a shot. 
[02:22:30]  Or Travis.  Or Travis, you know, they're good for getting coffee, let's be honest.  Enjoy your time here.  You're going nowhere.  Yeah, we don't care about you.  But then you got these three go-getters over there.  One, we already hired Derek, right?  A little bit.  You get a little bit of something-something from the company.  And it's so funny because Derek worked his ass off.  Now look at what he's doing.  He's in a ploy now.  Yeah, he's hanging.  Yeah.  He's leaning against the back wall, enjoying himself.  He's bossing the other interns around.  Pull the strings.  All under the rouge.  Or the rouge?  Under the red makeup?  Yes, that's right. 
[02:23:00]  Jesus.  That's clever rouge.  All under the rouge that he's now training young Nathaniel on how to run the equipment.  But it's all about Derek just wants to kind of sit back and enjoy a little bit.  That's all.  That's right.  And then you got Nathaniel and Danny.  Danny, that's his thing.  They're kind of like the Cardinals, you know.  And now you got Derek.  He's kind of in that Pope position.  The Pope.  And these guys are vying for a little piece of the action now.  And I got to tell you now, Nathaniel's in the lead.  Just by a little bit, Danny.  Just a little bit. 
[02:23:30]  Derek just walks around now looking like a young strapping Timothy Hutton.  He has those two slaves do his work.  Yes, Derek.  No, Ben told me to come in.  I'm just teaching him how to run the board today in case I eat shit one day, you know,  and I can't come in.  Oh, wow.  Doing it for the company.  That's why he's taking a break.  I like that.  No, he's just gearing up for taking that day off is what he's doing.  Yeah, you're going to fit well with this company, passing the buck like everyone else does.  You know what it is?  He wants a road trip, and he's sticking up, you know, to come on the road and get laid.  Yeah, you know. 
[02:24:00]  So he's going to have one of these two dumbbells do it.  That's the way he looks at it.  A perfect XM employee.  Yep.  Just pass the buck.  Pass the buck to somebody else.  You do it.  Thank you.  I'll get back to you in the meeting on how it worked.  There you go.  All right.  Where are we?  So we did that.  We wasted another five minutes because we're that damn good.  And now we'll go to Gene in Jersey.  This will waste another minute or two.  Gene in Jersey.  How are you doing?  Now I'm going to acknowledge all the things that we do to waste time on this show.  That's right.  Gene, go ahead.  What's up?  Welcome to the program, Gene.  Gene?  Five seconds. 
[02:24:30]  Hey, can you hear me?  Yes.  Well, why don't we do a little level check here?  Go test one, two, three.  Test one, two, three.  Oh, hold on.  Let me just touch up slightly there.  Okay.  Can you do one more test there?  Test one, two, three.  That's nice.  Yeah, I like the sound.  Very nice.  All right, Gene, if you will, speak slowly because we've got a lot of new listeners in  Alabama.  All right.  Hey, you guys have got a great show, man.  I love that commercial with Howard Stern, that perpetrated fag.  Oh, the XM Satellite Radio commercial?  I'm getting a lot of abuse on the fan sites. 
[02:25:00]  Why is that?  Because we're playing the commercial a lot, Anthony.  Yeah, we are.  Yeah, it's the way it is.  He should, man.  He's a perpetrator.  Of course.  I just like that we can get under his skin and there's nothing he can do about it.  It just makes me giggle.  Yeah, I have to listen to him all the time, man, but now that I've got you guys, fuck Howard.  All right.  Thank you, Gene.  Yeah, this is what's cool.  The new listeners are slowly but surely getting hooked, Anthony.  I like to acknowledge that from time to time.  Jay in Arizona. 
[02:25:30]  Yes, Jay, you're a new listener?  Yes, I'm a new listener.  And what got you hooked?  Um, that strong-shouldered young boy, that Jim Norton.  I really like him.  Oh, thanks, fella.  You sound a lot like that.  No, seriously, I'm not gay.  Oh, thank God.  I'm a new listener.  I was ready to set you up with Ricky there.  You sound a little like Ricky.  Thanks for breaking that, breaking character.  Way to kill a rod.  Oh, come on, Norton.  Hey, Norton's funny, though.  He really is.  I watched him on that show with that phony. 
[02:26:00]  What's his name?  Colin.  Colin's not a phony.  Colin's not.  No, no, he's cool.  You're a little funny, though, Norton.  I think you're, uh, you definitely make that show.  Thank you.  Hey, that's very hurtful.  No, you guys are good.  I didn't mean to shit.  Oh, tough crowd.  I'm a big Howard Stern fan.  I've been listening to him for years, and I just got this XM radio.  I've been listening to you guys for, like, two weeks.  Okay.  And I'm thinking about not going to serious, obviously.  I mean, I like you.  You guys are definitely cutting edge compared to what he does now.  Well, we're still trying to do a radio show is what it comes down to. 
[02:26:30]  You know, if we sat here and said that Howard, you know, didn't have a great career,  and we'd be, you know, liars and phonies, but the fact is, though, he's really not doing  it anymore.  He just doesn't want to do it.  Well, who did you have on there yesterday?  I laughed for an hour.  That guy said nigger in a fish tank.  Oh, shit.  It was funny.  Jesus.  Who said that?  Jesus.  Who said that yesterday?  Nigger in a fish tank?  Jay, but he did it as an impression of, uh, it was a Chris Penner impression.  He did an impression of somebody.  Yeah, and it was a dunk tank.  My God.  It wasn't more, was it?  All right.  Thank you, Jay.  Thanks, buddy. 
[02:27:00]  Let's, uh, let's, uh, I have to give an answer to John from Wack Bag.  All right.  There are, like, 5,967 ways I could answer that, but I'm not gonna.  All right?  How many ways, dude?  That's a lot.  Yeah, it is a lot.  Well, now you're really talking in code.  Yeah.  5,697 ways.  Oh, my God.  Oh, mighty.  Yeah.  What?  No, I just had to give him, uh, an answer.  So I gave him the answer.  Am I out of this one?  Oh, my God. 
[02:27:30]  That's just a weird random number.  Dude, that's a lot of, why did you say a million?  You know, it's too many.  Come on.  It's funny.  Come on, laughing.  All right.  So, uh, who else is on the, uh, phone there?  We got a phone person?  No?  That's funny.  Stop it, Captain Obvious.  No, I want to know who's on the.  There's no one else on the phone.  All right.  We're gonna go, uh, with a cute little story.  And, uh, we have this 911 thing we gotta do.  And, um, and, yeah, and maybe some, I don't know.  Oh, oh, oh. 
[02:28:00]  You wanted to talk about the assault on the media.  That's a quick answer.  Yes.  I saw the assault on the media.  It was really funny.  Very funny.  The video's up on opiananthony.com?  Yeah.  Okay.  It was from that cruise ship, uh, mishap.  Big wave that hit the Norwegian dawn.  And then it docked here in New York.  And, uh, there were a lot of press down there.  Talking to the passengers.  How fearful they were.  They weren't fear for their lives.  And, um, got a lot of reporters around.  And it was a great opportunity to get the opiananthony wow, uh, signs in front of the cameras. 
[02:28:30]  And I guess it was, who was it?  Nathaniel and Danny?  Mm-hmm.  Was that two young go-getters?  Look at that.  Ah.  Oh.  Nathaniel with that big worked-out body.  That's it.  And they trotted behind the cameras, yelling something.  I couldn't quite hear what it was.  Well, why didn't they come in here?  But it was a great visual.  Here they go.  They had, uh, they had the big signs with our stupid cartoon characters that were retiring. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, by the way, if you are doing assault on the media, there's been a whole discussion about this on the message boards.  Uh-huh.  Don't say ONA, because no one really knows what ONA is.  You know, we're really trying to, we're really trying to use the media to get the names, uh, the name of the show out there.  And the fact that we're back on, on, uh, XM satellite radio.  Yes.  So please say Opie and Anthony.  Not ONA.  Yeah, ONA's great if you're, you know, part of the, uh, part of the, uh, the cult, but, uh, the outside people don't know what that means yet.  Yes, uh, Nathaniel.  Jesus, you're tall.  What are you, 6'4"? 
[02:29:30]  Uh, hold on.  Oh, that mic isn't on.  Oh, wow.  Who's running the board here?  Ricky?  Yeah.  God, Ricky, move over.  Let me get back in there.  Yes, I'm about 6'4", maybe a little higher.  Wow.  A little taller.  A little higher?  Yeah, I'm retarded, sorry.  Always been tall, whole life?  Yep.  The tall kid?  Sure have.  Yeah.  You got a big one?  Nathaniel's either packing almost 5 or 11.  Well, we enjoyed the assault on the media. 
[02:30:00]  That's for sure.  Thank you.  Yeah, a little inarticulate, I must.  Yeah, it was a little.  Well, what, I didn't hear the audio.  I just saw the video.  Something yelled out, but I wasn't quite sure what it was.  I just like how they both just paraded behind her.  Just walking.  There was no stress.  No, like, big, no jump in the scene.  They were just like they had the signs and were walking to wherever they were going.  Right.  Behind, they decided to take the path behind the reporter.  Like they might have been on.  Oh, here you go.  Like they might have been on their way to picket something.  Yeah, yeah.  And they were just carrying their signs to the place that they were going to picket, 
[02:30:30]  and it was picked up by the camera.  Yeah.  And they were carrying on kind of a conversation with each other.  Do you want to turn the lights back on, Art?  Yeah, it's a little dark.  Do you, Eric?  Do you want to get a little romantic?  Do you want to touch each other's faces and kiss without our mouths open?  Yeah.  Scratch each other.  Scratch each other with our long fingernails.  All right, so what was said, Danny?  Well, I remember screaming Opie and Anthony,  and then I guess something else came out of my mouth also following it, 
[02:31:00]  but I have no idea what it is.  Sounds a little like Wahoo.  I think you might have actually said Wahoo.  That was an O&A party rock, wasn't it?  I had to go home and listen to it like four or five times.  Was it a Wahoo or like a Woohoo?  Wahoo.  Were you trying to make some kind of noise of excitement?  I suppose I was.  Because there was no excitement in you walking.  Opie and Anthony.  Yeah!  Opie and Anthony.  I don't know what it was.  Wahoo?  All right.  Something along those lines. 
[02:31:30]  We have the audio queued up.  Oh, we do?  All right, Derek?  Passengers are being offered a 50% refund off this cruise  and half off any future cruise if they decide to take it.  Now, Norwegian Dawn officials say that they will be holding a news conference at 12.30.  The captain will not be made available for comment.  The Norwegian Dawn sets sail again at 3 o'clock this afternoon.  It's really a visual.  Yeah, it is.  We understand the visual.  Opie and Anthony.  Woo! 
[02:32:00]  Woo!  Jesus.  It's like Tourette's convention walking behind it.  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  I think it was Opie and Anthony, O and A, and then Woo.  Plus, I stepped on his line, too.  So, it was just terrible.  The whole time, though, is the Opie and Anthony signs just slowly making their way across the  screen.  Yes, very slowly.  Just, we have plenty of time to see it.  Why didn't you guys stand there with them and just yell, Opie and Anthony, until they  just cut away?  Oh, there it is on your monitor.  All right, yeah, let's see.  You want to take a look-see.  There they go.  There goes Danny walking by.  Danny walking by. 
[02:32:30]  Woo!  This reporter going, oh, Jesus.  Reported it and bat an eye, though.  No, no.  Very professional.  Yeah.  They're slowly but surely starting to hate us again in the New York media.  Yeah, as we ran back, somebody from the van sort of yelled out, assholes.  Where are the assholes?  Oh, now, where are the assholes?  Okay.  I think that was just their way of saying, you got us, you know?  Sure.  Kudos.  Yeah, of course.  What was really cool was that on Channel 7's website, they actually kept the video  up uncut and they left that in with the signs and the audio and everything. 
[02:33:00]  Really?  On their website?  Mm-hmm.  All uncut for you guys.  Well, the assaults on the media are starting to get more and more, what's the word I'm  looking for?  Like, more and more...  Effective.  Not effective.  No, of course not.  They're happening more.  Prolific.  Oh, okay.  More and more prolific.  Prolific.  Yeah, I like that.  Okay, prolific.  How about they're happening more?  They're happening more.  They're happening more.  I like that, too.  All right.  Yeah, very good job.  Thank you, boys.  You got it.  Wonderful.  Hey, man.  And that's how you waste another five minutes of radio right there.  A little controversy with the Norwegian Dawn ship story also. 
[02:33:30]  Really?  There's more to it?  Yeah, apparently the ship and the cruise line had paid Donald Trump something like a million  dollars for the ship to be used on the show The Apprentice.  It was supposed to be used.  It was already paid.  It was coming into New York, and it was going to be used.  There was a very narrow date that the filming was going to be available.  So now they're speculating that instead of slowing down or taking a new course around 
[02:34:00]  the storm, they trudged through a storm to get to New York on time to shoot this thing,  which they missed now because they had to spend time in South Carolina getting repairs.  But now they're saying that the captain of the ship was told, get that ship to New York  on time and go through the storm instead of going around it or stopping and waiting for  the storm to pass.  Uh-oh.  What a coincidence.  His hair looks like a 70-foot wave.  Oh, that's terrific. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, that's, uh, thank you.  I like when we tease the Donald here in a Trump hair joke.  It just never gets old.  Wow, who saw a hair joke coming there?  Only in New York, kids.  Only in New York.  Only in New York.  Yeah, so I'm sure that now will be at the forefront of all the lawsuits that will come  in.  I wasn't throwing it at you, Jimmy.  I know.  I was going over your head for the garbage pail.  All right.  It's good. 
[02:35:00]  Chris from Wisconsin.  Chris.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Chris.  I'm going to help you kill some time for those three fucks that got problems with health  bills, but, uh, actually, I'm a trucker, and I was listening on XM, and I just realized  that you guys were on here, and the first show I listened to yesterday, and I'm already  a hook.  Uh, where are you guys originally from?  Uh, New York, but, uh, you know, I've been doing radio since I was 18, so I've had to live  in some god-awful places.  And, uh, Anthony, uh, another New Yorker, but I spent some time in, uh, California. 
[02:35:30]  I was born in Bayonne, and when we were very young, my parents, uh, lived in Jersey  City, and then we moved to Edison, I think, until I was in fourth grade, and then we moved  to North Brunswick.  Yeah.  And then after North Brunswick, I moved to Cliffside Park, Jersey.  Actually, I was born in a story.  I moved into New York.  I was born in a story.  I'm the Jersey guy.  And then moved out to...  Hey, Jersey.  And then moved out to Long Island, because, uh, they started building a lot of, uh, 
[02:36:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Are you guys still up in New York, or do you guys down in D.C. where they had some studios?  We're out of, uh, New Yorker, as I call it, to sound hip, the Big Apple.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, that's why this, that's why this show sounds so fresh every morning.  We don't have to be weighed down by that B.S. in Washington.  We're our, we are our own bosses here in New York City.  All right, full deal.  Uh, like I said, great channel.  I'm ready to call five of my friends, and they're listening to you right now.  They're hooked now.  How long did you have XM, like, how long have you had XM for? 
[02:36:30]  I haven't had XM for probably about two years, and I've been sitting on sports forever.  And then they came across with a commercial saying that you guys were free, and I didn't  even know that this channel existed.  And then, uh, I turned it on yesterday with Jay Moore, and I, uh, I had to pull over.  I was laughing so hard.  I had tears in my eyes.  Oh, thanks.  You know what?  Jay's coming back, I think, Friday.  Let me ask you a question.  When you look at the channel guide, does it say high voltage on your channel guide?  Yeah, it says high voltage, the, uh, Opie and Anthony show on the channel guide.  Okay. 
[02:37:00]  Yep.  Thanks, bro.  All right, guys.  Thank you.  So, Wisconsin, Chris, checking in.  Isn't that great?  That's good.  I love the new listeners coming on board.  Slowly but surely.  You know, it's going to take some time.  I'll agree.  They're still trying to figure us out.  Uh, Anthony, you know, this would be a good segue into what we did after the show yesterday.  Trying to remember what we did after the show yesterday.  See, we moved the, you know, the hours of the show so we could get some West Coast action,  which is still not really coming in that much.  West Coast.  Uh, so the, you know, we're doing a morning show live from New York, 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. 
[02:37:30]  Now, it used to be 6 to 10, but we realized, you know, most people in, in California, you  know, not really awake enough to, to participate in the show.  So, we kind of moved it.  That's what we're telling everyone.  We just really wanted an extra hour of sleep.  Yeah.  Which we don't get, because it's all relative.  Yeah, I'm with you with the hope.  I wind up going to sleep an hour early, a hour later in the night, so.  It's all relative.  I'm still getting no sleep.  So, the 6 a.m. hour, because it's very important to the New York audience, you know, we're doing  kind of a best of, but, you know, you just throw a best of on for an hour, people are 
[02:38:00]  like, ugh.  So, what we're trying to do to hook some people is we intro the bits.  Uh-huh.  We're introing the bits in the 6 a.m. hour, and we usually, well, all right, I'll let you  in on a little secret.  Remember, we tape it after the show, but then, but then, how we talk, we make believe  it's the actual day.  Yeah, that goes over so well.  We're fooling everybody with that.  That clever rouge.  So, now, you know, I just tore down the third wall for you.  Yes.  So, now you can enjoy it.  How we enjoy it. 
[02:38:30]  Would it be the fourth wall officially?  Why?  Fourth wall.  It's just what it's called.  It broke the fourth wall.  But on TV, they used to say the third wall.  No, because four walls would be like the room.  Okay.  And then once you tear one of them down, now you can look into the room and see the  happening.  But you could still tear down the third wall and still see into the room.  You only got a corner.  But if the fourth wall's already gone, you don't need to tear the third wall down, because  then you have half a room that's going to collapse on you, and your little insight will  be meaningless, because you'll be dead under a pile of rubble.  Two walls just go flap, flap, right on top of you.  Every room.  Flows from under up. 
[02:39:00]  He tore down the third wall, that idiot.  Why don't you just say we're going to tear down all walls and then nuke the site.  You just tear down that fourth wall.  But every room has walls, and you number them.  Look.  I like popping through the ceiling.  One, two, three, four.  But I don't want to tear down the wall that is labeled four.  I like tearing down the wall that's labeled three.  The third wall.  Yeah.  Because everyone tears down the fourth.  It doesn't, there's still going to be three walls up.  So instead of tearing down the wall, why don't we just draw a little hole in the stall  between the two?  Wow. 
[02:39:30]  Ricky took our advice from this morning, and now he's trying to look ghetto.  I think there's trouble.  His hat's backwards.  His hat's on backwards.  He untucked his shirt.  I got it.  There was too many things for him to get this trip.  Oh, chopper down, chopper down.  Chopper crashes in the Florida Everglades.  Oh, boy.  That was a traffic copter.  That's a good place to crash.  Getting eaten by alligators as we speak, probably.  All right.  Welcome to you.  So anyway, so to keep people sort of interested in the best of stuff in the 6 a.m. hour on  the East Coast, we kind of intro the bits, and we do it after the show. 
[02:40:00]  Make believe it's that day that it's running.  And yesterday, we were fortunate enough to have Jay Morse, you know, continue with us  after the show and help us with the intros to some of these worst of bits, Anthony.  Exactly.  And I think it's worth playing now because it'll waste another ten minutes.  Ooh.  Ooh.  We're going to acknowledge all the things we do today to waste radio time.  We're playing recorded material.  We're going to change.  Well, you've got to eat that tuna fish sandwich.  Yes, I do.  So yesterday, here's the first one we did. 
[02:40:30]  This is going to air, what, tomorrow?  Yeah, right?  This will air tomorrow at 6 a.m.  Yeah.  But you might not be up to hear it, so why don't we play it now for you, okay?  Way to go, O.  Thank you.  I like it.  Listen to this.  We've got to talk about Norton.  He hired an older escort.  A grandma, I believe, right?  Yeah, I don't really remember the bit, though.  I'm reading it here.  It said, older escort's mother's.  Norton hires a grandma escort with a bunt and ass cheeks that look like two lima beans.  How do you not remember that? 
[02:41:00]  I don't know.  I didn't realize I fucked Corey Kahaney.  Wow, what did she do to you?  Nothing.  I love Corey Kahaney.  Just kind of tie in a name with, you know, the last comic.  And why did Jay leave?  He's coming back now.  Jay?  That is bullshit, man.  She works her ass off, Jim, and that is bullshit.  That is bullshit and amateur.  She's got kids.  She's married.  She works her ass off.  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.  So you could have said Lisa Lampanelli. 
[02:41:30]  You didn't say great-grandmother.  Yeah.  She has a bunt, but it starts under her nose and ends at her fucking ankles.  The queen of mean, are you?  Don't get on her bad side.  She'll compare you to a black guy.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  You don't like when she gets all mean in her act?  Oh, heck no.  I won't go to the bathroom.  You do what you want to do.  I'm not getting picked on.  Look at him.  He looks like a testicle. 
[02:42:00]  Not cool, Jim.  You're right, man.  I'm just kind of cool.  What is it?  You don't like female comics?  Oh.  Well, I actually do if they're good.  Like, I think DeGeneres is great.  I love it on DeGeneres.  Yeah.  For someone that looks like David Spade, she's on the list.  Those two fucking freaks are turning into each other.  Dude, David Spade, if you don't laugh during those Capital One commercials, I don't know what's wrong with you.  That's what Dennis Miller doing Net Zero, like, it's just a bunch of whores.  Ten dollars a month.  You just lay down on the floor and let people jerk off all over you. 
[02:42:30]  That's what you're doing.  Let me tell you about Net Zero.  Check, check, check, check.  Dude, you were the hippest guy in the world when you were on Saturday Night Live.  Net Zero.  You got SNL to clear Exile and Main Street songs before you did the news, and now you're going,  Ten dollars a month to get that.  Fucking zilch.  It's like that King of Queens bitch doing Pennzoil.  Like, that's who's supposed to be doing those commercials.  Leah Remini?  Whatever.  She's a Scientologist. 
[02:43:00]  Is she?  I don't care what she is.  I'd love her to drop a silo into my mouth.  There you have it.  So we taped these after the show, Anthony.  Yeah.  As we try to eat a little breakfast here, that's the excuse to play some of these really  fast.  What are you eating, Opie?  Just a little egg white and potato on like a roll thing.  I'm hungry.  Kind of nice.  All right, so here's the second one that we taped yesterday that we'll air, I guess,  sometime tomorrow on the 6 a.m. hour on the East Coast.  Giving you a little preview. 
[02:43:30]  Ooh.  Well, yeah.  Yeah, because a lot of people don't get up and listen to this.  No, no.  I know a lot of people that are like, oh, I just don't get to listen until 6 o'clock.  This is new material.  You're missing new stuff.  There's new material that they would not hear unless we were playing for them now.  Here we go.  I got an email on my website from Stalker Patty, and she's very polite.  Yeah, she always is.  And I asked her, I said, how do you enjoy your newfound celebrity?  And it was like a three-page like, I have to admit, it takes getting used to.  It's very hard when I'm used to my private life to have to then deal with people. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, and the paparazzi.  And the paparazzi.  And the paparazzi.  I'm just used to working at the TV for chiclets.  It's like working over like Willy Wonka.  She's over there in the chocolate factory dealing with people on a daily basis.  How she does that, because she's not right in the head.  Do you think she tries to be a good salesperson?  No, you don't want those chocolates.  I know what you're looking for.  Like, no, you don't want that. 
[02:44:30]  That's Fugazi.  Come over here in the back.  I'll give you the good chocolates.  You want something with a little more crunch to it.  I know what you want.  Like an Almond Joy, sort of.  She signs her emails, peace out, Patty.  Yeah.  It is, I want to just bite her fingers.  Peace out.  Well, on the message board, you got some people that have some odd little...  Yeah.  Oh, when I was on, when I called you guys that one time, the message boards were like, 
[02:45:00]  yeah, that was awesome, but you know what?  It's going to take more than that and him groveling to win my fucking graces back.  What?  It's like, what are you doing?  Yeah, but notice how he went on right when his show got canceled.  Hmm, that's when the red flags went on.  Yeah, I went on to promote a show that didn't exist.  I'm here to promote Jim Norton at the fucking Boston Comedy Connection, April 29th and 30th,  you shit fucker, Jay.  Keep your eye on the ball, Jay Jay.  Don't get cocky.  Keep your eye on the ball, Jay Jay. 
[02:45:30]  So there you go.  That was supposed to intro some kind of bit.  I don't care.  For tomorrow, it don't make any sense as intros anymore.  For tomorrow's 6 a.m. hour.  Oh, I know what Ben introduced.  It's a fucking really funny rant about me at the Boston Comedy Connection on April 29th and 30th.  Oh, boy.  Ooh.  Oh, boy.  Now we've got problems.  Dad.  All right.  What's the matter, Opie?  No, it's okay.  Opie.  Problem?  Ooh, chimp frenzy on the news.  What's wrong?  Looks like a chimp went crazy.  Oh, my God.  Once again, Eric's going to write down something. 
[02:46:00]  Stop writing and talk.  What's the panic?  And got a special guest on Line 11 there for you.  Wanted to say hello.  Oh, wow.  In the middle of eating.  Sean, we're in the middle of doing our radio show and eating at the same time.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  It's Sean Hannity, everyone.  I know this seems like a bizarro world, but, yes, we are friends with Sean Hannity.  You know, I'm sick of answering that question, and I'm sick of being attacked for saying, yeah, these are good guys. 
[02:46:30]  Don't tell anyone.  We don't want anyone to know that, Sean.  And I said, you know, how many times do you want them to say they're sorry?  Repent.  Okay?  Get over it.  Change your heart.  Oh, wow.  Look at you.  Thank you.  There's a new pope.  Let's all move on.  Right?  Yeah, but by the way, Opie, because now you're on Basic 202, and I have it on my car, I did hear the day that you threw that board at that girl, by the way.  The what?  The?  What did you do?  You threw something.  Poker chips.  Poker chips.  Oh, the poker chips.  Yeah.  Poker chips.  Yeah, that was pretty cool. 
[02:47:00]  He's gotten better, though.  That was the anger of us first getting back to work.  Yeah, I'm a lot better nowadays, Sean.  Did she do all right?  You guys took care of her?  Well, we don't like to tell you what happens after the show.  We like people to think that we're really, really, really that nasty and mean.  No, but I could tell you felt bad.  There was probably things that happened after the show that made everything okay.  That's how I feel every night, you know, sitting next to Alan Combs.  If I had poker chips, I'd be throwing them at him.  You should.  You know he's holding you back, right? 
[02:47:30]  You want me to tell him you said that?  He's holding you back a little bit.  He's still trying to get Anthony and I to do his radio show.  We're not doing his radio show.  We're going right to the top.  If we're going to do any radio, it's Sean Hannity.  That's it.  No, you guys did the radio show.  And you know what?  It's interesting.  And we talked about this before, Opie, that, you know, even though we do very, very, very  different shows, you know, there are a lot of people that, you know, flip around the  dial.  For example, if they want news, they might go to my show.  But if, you know, they want just pure, fun entertainment, they go to you guys. 
[02:48:00]  We get serious, though.  We talked about the new Pope today, Sean.  Yeah, but would Bill Donahue approve of what you said?  Well, it's an interesting choice.  Let's just put it that way.  We think he's a little too old.  Well, you know what?  Traditionally, though, a lot of these guys, do you know the last Pope was the third longest  serving Pope in the history of the Church?  It really was short term.  Do you think they don't like that?  Do you think they kind of like to keep these terms a little shorter than the last John Paul? 
[02:48:30]  Well, you know, the average age of the average cardinal, and remember, those are the guys  that are in the conclave choosing these guys, I think, 5, 66 years old, and they're usually  going to pick from among their own, so it's kind of anticipated that they're going to pick  somebody old.  The real shock was, you know, 25 years ago when they picked Pope John Paul II, because  he was 58, which was considered really, really young.  That's relatively young, and you would think the Church, you would think they would want  to kind of be a little more relatable to some of the younger people to get a relatively, 
[02:49:00]  you know, even 58, a relatively younger Pope in there, would kind of signal to people  that maybe they're into relating a little more to the younger generation.  To just put an older guy in there like this, after having an older Pope for so many years  now, it seems, I don't know, I don't think it's the best thing for them.  Look, I think John Paul did something that was pretty miraculous.  He reached out to people.  If you look at when he traveled the world, there were a lot of young people that would show  that's what I'm saying, but that was years ago. 
[02:49:30]  But it all depends, Anthony, what you mean by relatable.  Does that mean that they should change their values or change what their belief system is?  I always sort of looked at a church like they are, that that's the standard, and to the  best of our human ability, we should aspire to be better people and reach that standard,  you know, as best as possible.  I mean, but we are not the standard.  We all fall short of whatever that standard is.  But if they say, all right, well, we're going to change our views on this, this, this, and 
[02:50:00]  this to accommodate popular culture, I don't, then what's the point of having a church?  You can just go make your own church.  No, I know what you mean, but they do change the rules every so often to fit just society,  you know, and times changing.  I'm not saying so much that they should change their values, but they are human beings,  and you are going to get a different viewpoint from a 78-year-old man than you will from a  58-year-old man, and you will get people that aren't going to be able to relate to a  78-year-old man as well as they would to a 58-year-old man. 
[02:50:30]  Look, you guys know how conservative I am.  I wouldn't mind if they raised the question of letting priests marry.  Bravo.  You know, because I think what's happening is you're limiting the pool of potential candidates  out there, because a lot of guys aren't going to, you know, live their life and not  I thought he was going to say limiting the pool of potential victims.  Oh, Jesus.  I thought you were going to be a shock jog all of a sudden.  Shock jog.  I'm like, is he about to say what I'm thinking?  Oh, my God.  And the church doesn't have to change its value system. 
[02:51:00]  I mean, the commandments are the commandments, but it's like the certain way they seem to  relate to people, like having Bernard Law participate in these services after what's  gone on.  I mean, it's just an atrocious, out-of-touch decision.  Look, I came probably, I'm a Catholic, and I came about that close.  I came about that close to leaving the church because of that whole church scandal.  I didn't have such a good pastor.  Frankly, half these guys aren't worth their soul, because they didn't stand up and say,  this is despicable, this is disgusting, this is evil in our own church, and if you have 
[02:51:30]  evil in your church, you've got to root it out.  And they didn't, and it really started from the top down, because they were protecting  these guys and just shifted them over to these other places, and these kids were becoming  victimized unnecessarily.  I mean, it was atrocious.  But with that said, I think the church, there are a lot of good people.  They have dedicated their lives.  You don't judge a whole group of people because of the actions of a few.  You know, but I think in the case of the apostles, they were married men.  Jesus himself picked married men to be his top guys.  So it's really a church rule in that case, or the way I see it, versus a, you know, a God 
[02:52:00]  rule.  Sean, going back to the scandal, though, the new pope openly said yesterday, I guess,  that a lot of that was American media hype.  That wasn't American media hype.  This was a real, you know, these were real kids really being molested by really evil people.  But they said it was blown out way out of proportion by the American media, not the media from all  over the world, just the American media. 
[02:52:30]  Look, I don't know if all of the cases that came out 20, 15, 20, and 30 years later, you  got to suspect that maybe some of these weren't true, and maybe that was played up, but a  lot of them were true, and a lot of them were accurate.  And there's one thing that really became clear is that when they found out about it, the  hierarchy covered it up.  Right.  And I find that worse, as bad as the guys that were responsible for this crime.  And those guys that committed or perpetrated that crime on kids, especially, you know, 
[02:53:00]  why don't we charge them and bring them up, you know, send them into prison where they  belong?  And doesn't, like, having a guy like Bernard Law, like, kind of appear, it's almost like  a conscious decision they're making.  It's almost, there's an arrogance behind that decision, because there's plenty of, I'm  sure, you know, good cardinals that they could have gotten to take his place.  You know, it's difficult about it.  You guys, for example, appeal to a lot of, you know, young guys, 18 to 35, 18 to 49.  If we look, if we just look at real demographics, and you guys talk about what is clearly an 
[02:53:30]  obvious injustice, and the problem then becomes, I think, that a lot of guys say, this is nothing  but a corrupt church, and they throw the whole baby out with bat fodder.  And, you know, I think there's a lot of good that you can get out of a church.  You can learn about morality, learn about, you know, the meaning of life.  I think, ultimately, we all want to find out why it is we're here on this earth anyway.  And, unfortunately, a lot of people look at that, they see corruption, and they throw  everything out.  Well, I think it's the job of the church to set an example, and instead of other people 
[02:54:00]  that are potential parishioners listening to us and listening to the press badmouth the  church, instead of the church just covering it up like it doesn't exist, how about coming  out, admitting to some of these things?  Exactly.  And then, you know, regaining the faith of the people.  It's not the press's fault or shows like ours' fault that people are turning away from  the church.  No, I mean, let's put it this way.  I never thought in my life that I would think twice about having my kids around a priest alone. 
[02:54:30]  Right.  But you know what?  It's not going to happen.  Of course not, see?  That's you making a conscious decision based on what you've heard.  Based on a lot of what I've heard, and based on a lot of the corruption that existed there.  But look, I judge everybody as an individual.  I don't think, I've met, I have a great pastor, for example, I go to St. Patrick's in Huntington.  Guy's a great guy, and there's not a corrupt bone in his body, and what I loved about him  is when all this was going on, he stood up there during his homilies, and he just ripped 
[02:55:00]  away what the church was doing.  Oh, that's great.  And that took a lot of courage, and I always respected him for that.  That's what you want to hear, yeah.  And it does seem...  You want to hear the truth.  And that's why, if there's one thing that I see about this guy, if you look at it from  a left versus right standpoint, the left is going crazy because there's a Catholic, you  know, cardinal now, pope, that actually believes that abortion is wrong, he's not going to change  his position on gay marriage, and he's not going to let women become priests. 
[02:55:30]  I'm like, if you disagree with him on all those positions, you probably aren't really a part  of that church anyway.  Boy, you don't expect the church to change to accommodate culture's values.  You expect the church to stand as the standard, and that people, hopefully, in the course  of their life, you know, grow and get wiser and smarter and better, you know, we start  attaining some of those goals, especially when we're about to die and want to get into  heaven.  Hey, Sean, I've got a problem, though.  He came out and said he doesn't like that rock and roll music.  Well, but we have a fundamental disagreement. 
[02:56:00]  You like the rock and roll, right?  Yeah, I like rock and roll.  I'm the biggest country fan, though, you'll ever meet in your life.  I like country music, too.  Well, Anthony and I are trying to figure out where does this rock and roll thing come  from, because when all this was being created as a religion, there was no rock and roll.  But now he's coming out saying rock and roll is bad, and we want to know which artists  are bad and which ones are good.  Or is it all rock and roll?  I'm thinking you get the Pope on ONA and you're asking these really tough artists.  There you go.  And last question, and it's a very important one, Sean. 
[02:56:30]  Will you be picking up Hustler magazine to read our exclusive interview?  No, but you guys can email me a copy of the interview part.  Isn't that great?  Sean Hannity shows up in newspapers, the Times, things like that.  We're in Hustler.  Yeah.  I bet Anthony could do a great Larry Flint.  Ah, Anthony.  That's not bad.  Hey, we're going to give you a little something for your show today, okay?  You're going to be playing the audio of the bells ringing?  I don't know.  What do you got?  If you've got a good producer, he's going to give it to you. 
[02:57:00]  Where they make the announcement that there's a new Pope, it sounds like the guy's calling  a World Cup soccer game.  No, it's insane.  The people are losing their minds, and one of our listeners discovered if you play Hell's  Bells as that guy's announcing it, it syncs up perfectly.  All right.  I'll make sure my engineer gets on that today.  Sounds like live ACDC.  It's amazing.  It's really, really good.  Well, Sean Hannity, this is a pleasure.  All right, guys.  It's always good to talk to you.  We've got to get you back on TV, so next time you guys get in trouble, we'll put you on.  Well, we're trying to stay out of trouble for a while. 
[02:57:30]  You guys have been doing pretty good lately.  And you're on XM 124 at 3 p.m. on the East Coast, right?  Yep.  Yes, sir.  Thank you, guys.  All right.  Sean Hannity, everyone.  Very cool.  Thanks, Sean.  All right.  Talk to you guys.  Bye.  There he goes.  I like the Sean Hannity.  What's wrong?  No, no, no.  I'm just...  Oh, okay.  We've got to take a break because some guy named Rocco's here.  Rocco who?  Rocco.  Oh, cool.  The chef Rocco?  Yes.  Remember from the show? 
[02:58:00]  The restaurant?  The restaurant?  And he was turning up in the papers all the time.  Doing every other thing.  Yeah, every other thing.  All right.  We'll find out what he's been up to.  How's that sound?  A lot of controversy.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yes.  No?  Yeah.  Shut up.  Wait.  We've got to go to Wyoming.  James?  Yes, sir.  Hey, James.  What's up?  Hello.  Well, I'm just driving, trying to get out of the fog and frame.  Oh, okay.  The fog?  Yeah, it's real fog. 
[02:58:30]  Yeah.  I just left Idaho last night in the snow and heavy winds.  Lay down and took a nap.  You know, every morning I get up, I listen to the Fox channel.  Yeah.  I listen to my morning news.  Okay.  We were talking about y'all.  Uh-huh.  And I sat down and checked out and said what kind of channel y'all was.  I have no idea what he's saying.  All right.  So, he was listening.  I guess a promo came on for the show.  Oh, okay.  And he turned on to see what our show is all about.  Right.  Well, James, what do you think? 
[02:59:00]  Well, so far, you talk Catholic.  I'm not Catholic, but...  What?  So far?  Y'all, I mean, that's all I've heard so far.  I mean, it's the first time I've been to see y'all.  Y'all was talking about the breeze, but I...  I just talked in entertainment and high voltage as well, so I figured you talked about more  subjects than the Catholic.  Absolutely.  But did you...  Let me ask you a question.  Did you feel bad when you killed him with the Kaiser Blade?  All right, James. 
[02:59:30]  Oh, call it the sling blade.  No, it's the sling blade.  James, you hang in there.  All right?  Yeah.  Don't touch that boy.  Have some french fried potatoes.  Mm-hmm.  The whole Pope thing is a...  Ask my buddy Carl.  Ah, Carl.  Nice.  Good call.  All right, very good.  The Pope thing is a very big story today.  You relax.  We barely touch our religion and stuff.  We go all over the place with this show.  Yeah.  All right.  It's religion today.  It's, you know, large vaginal lips later today.  I'm just amazed that we now broadcast to places where it gets foggy. 
[03:00:00]  That's so cool.  I aim to kill you with it.  That's getting a lot of those calls from Sling Blade.  Is that Sling Blade calling in?  Yep.  All right.  Well, we got to get that guy to call from a better phone next time.  James, if you're listening, we want you to call back someday, okay?  This is a funny show.  Queer funny, not ha-ha funny.  It's Ripple Mal Wednesday.  It's Ripple Mal Wednesday.  It's Ripple Mal Wednesday.  How about that woman that said the shirt off?

[03:02:00]  Calling in today though  I love it  We've been waiting for this  For six months  That's it  They slowly come across us  We knew we had a really  Really good show  And for six months  We had to wait  To get off the premium channel  And now  We're off  And people are discovering us  Every day  It's very, very cool  Some guy named Rocco  Is waiting outside the studio  To come in  I'll say hi  Cool  He was  Oh, he was the cook guy, right?  The show restaurant  Ready to make him feel welcome  What's up Rocco? 
[03:02:30]  How's it going Rocco?  How you doing?  How you doing?  Yeah  He does radio now  I do, I do radio  It's amazing  I didn't know I could do radio  He knows you put the headphones on  Stuff like that  Speak into the microphone  Isn't it annoying when guests  Don't speak into the microphone?  Yeah, they're off like  You ask them questions  Like, hey, yeah, you know  I don't have that problem  And I'm like  Pushing the microphone in their faces  He's got a good mic technique  Dumb ass  Put the microphone in here  Man, you've got a booming voice  I do?  I'm going to have to lower you down a little bit  Very nice  I haven't learned how to do all this yet  My engineer still does it 
[03:03:00]  It just looks like it's a lot to do  It really is  It freaks me out a little bit  I found there's no reason  To learn how to do that  I just like sitting here  For years now  Ten years together  Opie's been running the board  He seems to enjoy it  You know they pay him  A half a million more for that  Yeah, I know  You might want to pick it up  I take the hit  I don't care  I'll take the pay hit  Just so I don't have to press those buttons  We know his level of ambition  I've seen how angry it makes him sometimes  When something doesn't work  He's pushing the button  He gets all pissed off  It's like flying a jet plane, you know 
[03:03:30]  Yeah  Yeah, just like it  So congratulations, guys  Except the song not queuing up  Is just the song not queuing up  And not plummeting thousands of feet  Into the earth  But it's just like a jet  That's true  Besides that  It's just like  You even have the little  Barometer thing going on up there  The altimeter  That's it  That's the word I was looking for  Every time  I look at the meters  Every once in a while  And I'll adjust accordingly  And we're always at the same elevation  Well  Above sea level here  For some reason  You guys having fun here  On Fabulous XM?  It's great  It really is great  How cool is it, man  To just be able to do whatever you want 
[03:04:00]  Are you also doing the interview  For Rolling Stone Magazine?  Because that's exactly what  They're going to talk about today  How cool it is  Where's your show?  Where's your show?  I'm on WOR  You know  Couldn't be more different than XM  It's Mike Savage  Bob Grant  Bill O'Reilly  Oh, I love Bob Grant  Yeah  Talk about his cooking  You buffoon  That's it  That's him  We love Bob  How about Mike Savage?  How about Mike Savage?  I can't believe the stuff  They let him get away with  He's an animal  He's an animal  He's from Brooklyn  I'm from Jamaica, Queens  I know what it's like  To grow up in these neighborhoods 
[03:04:30]  Yeah  It's great to do radio in New York  When you're from New York  I think it's cool  I mean, we get a lot of phone calls  You know, it's a live one-hour talk show  It's about food, supposedly  But we end up talking about a lot of stuff  You get a lot of calls?  Tons of calls  Yeah, we don't get to them  You get to do a one-hour show?  Yeah  Isn't that great?  Is that bad?  A one-hour show?  No, we got this guy on XM  His name's Bob Edwards  Yeah  And they make a big deal about him  And we don't get it  Because he only does a one-hour show every day  One hour  He works four hours a week on air  I could easily do two  Because we have so many callers  That we don't get to 
[03:05:00]  But there's obviously not enough room  On the station for it  Does it start out talking about cooking  And then all of a sudden  You're talking about  You know, it's the essence of humanity  So it's a good starting point  To talk about a lot of different things  During the holidays especially  I have therapists come on  And talk about like, you know  Food as a weapon of mass dysfunction  At holiday tables  Just think about what happens  That's horrific  What is this, the Jon Stewart show?  Is this the Daily Show?  What's going on there?  That's horrific  We're very, very, very sarcastic here 
[03:05:30]  You've done TV, obviously  And you've done radio  And the two mediums  Like one is definitely not like this, right?  Yeah, no, no  I mean, I have a face for radio  So it's a good thing  I'm not doing a lot of TV  This is what they keep telling me  Face for radio  The guy was in People Magazine  He's one of the sexiest men  He's very handsome, right?  A little Photoshop goes a long way  You study the list there  Jesus Christ  How do you know he's one of the guys?  Big Rocco fan  Yeah, what happened?  Oh, you really?  Thank you  Yeah, I used to watch the restaurant  The restaurant, yeah  And I watched  Food Network, I imagine  I couldn't stand any of the employees  That were there 
[03:06:00]  There were a bunch of whiny, crying bitches  Well, you didn't know all that was set up  Right?  I mean, even though that was just like  Planted one after another  I didn't really find out until afterwards  That all of them were just  They were basically cast  Actors  You know  Yeah, yeah  And they had their roles to do  They were waiters  Which are out-of-work actors  But, you know, it made the show interesting  And Burnett's a genius for doing it  The guy knows what he's doing  I mean, there's no question  What happened?  Because all I used to read about  And Page Six here in New York  And all the gossip  Aren't they fun?  Where it was just you  Could not get along with anybody 
[03:06:30]  Well, I am an artist  I am a chef  And us chefs are very emotionally tied up  In what we do  You know, think about it  You're producing a product  Tell me about it  You're producing a product  That is conceived of  The manufacturing process starts  And eight minutes later  It's in someone's plate  You know, in someone's table  And every time it goes out  An hour later  It's on my chest  Exactly  And three hours later  You know where it is  And just think about it  You know, everyone that goes out  You're looking at it  Going, okay  Is this going to ruin my reputation  Or not?  This one's not so good 
[03:07:00]  I have to send it anyway  What am I going to do?  It's really very, very challenging  To compromise to the level  Where you can make a lot of money  And still be an artist  And have your integrity as an artist  You know, and keep that intact  So I'm out of the restaurant business  It was a big lesson for me  Yeah  After 25 years on the line  Every night I decided enough  That was it  Yeah  Women must love that though, man  You can cook  Women love a guy that can cook  You must get asked constantly  He probably still pulls the talents out like that  Of course  Must get asked  Page six talks about all his conquests 
[03:07:30]  Oh, how do you know?  Does he hit a lot of them?  I read page six  You were reading up  I read page  I don't know  I can't name  That's true  You've had a few conquests  You know, the thing I think that women like  About a man who can cook  Is that it's a very feminine thing  It's very maternal  It's very nurturing  To cook for someone  What's the first thing a mother does  When she has a baby?  She feeds it  Beats it  She feeds it after she beats it  So for a man to do something  Drives off a boat ramp  For a man to do something  That women normally do  I think is inherently sexy 
[03:08:00]  To women  Well, a woman would perceive that  As you caring  Yeah, exactly  So that's a very caring  Nurturing and feeding them  I mean, it's the nicest thing  You can do for someone  Doesn't hurt either  When you have washboard abs  Does it?  Yeah  As you walk around  In your Speedos  Looking delicious  I think they were gone  Looking delicious  You wouldn't believe  What I had to do  To get ready for that photo  And people  It was like 12 weeks of hell  Really working out  I was like  Find me a trainer  Who can make me  Look somewhat in shape  And let's go  They told you beforehand  That you were going to be  Like one of the sexiest men 
[03:08:30]  Well, they said  Yeah, send us a picture  And then, you know  A few weeks later  Like you're in  Get us a real picture  As soon as they told you  You were going to be one of those guys  You should have ballooned up  Like De Niro  In Raging Bull, man  That would have been hilarious  I'm sure they have  Standby people  Just in case  Oh, yeah  We can't use this  Jiminy Glick  I should have turned  Into Jiminy Glick  What was the picture?  I didn't see it  Whatever  Can we talk about  No, I wonder what the picture is  Oh, no  It's me  It's me as a lobster fisherman  That's what it was 
[03:09:00]  Yeah  I honestly didn't  I mean, I know who you are  But I didn't see the photo  So I'm loving  I'm loving W.O.R.  Because the people  Hey, Ann  Is all these  Rocco clippings  From your personal collection  That is my personal collection  You really are a mo  Are you the guy  Who sends me 50 emails a day  That's me  Ann's got a whole folder  Of Rocco  Wow  It's all my Rocco stuff  Some producer of yours  Is doing a good job  Let me just say  Congratulations to you guys  Back there  For giving him some prep  Yes, exactly  I'm talking to you  Even though you can't see me 
[03:09:30]  Ann, that's your Brad Pitt stuff  I'm getting it mixed up  With my Rocco stuff  Sorry  Oh my God  My Ashton Kutcher  Antonio Lamas  Oh no, not really  There you go  They're all so cute  Can I ask you a question  Do you find that you are  Less obscene now  That you can be  As obscene as you want to be  Yes  Isn't that wild?  It's a crazy phenomenon  At first  Getting to satellite radio  We cursed a lot  And now we're just  Alright  And now that you can do it 
[03:10:00]  You just don't care  Now it's all about  Just getting to the subject  You want to talk about  Instead of like  Setting it up in codes  And stuff  Now it's just like  Alright, we want to talk  About pussy  We're going to talk  About pussy  Wow  Is that the picture?  That's depressing  I don't need to see that  Abs and famous  God, that hurts  He's leaving the room  What's going on?  He's not very happy  He's rushing out  That just depresses him  I'm a four with a microwave  Yeah, he could cook  With his shirt off  And the girl would be looking  Oh, smelling the food  I'm whipping you up 
[03:10:30]  A little something called  You'll be passed out  In five minutes  After you eat it  It's funny  The recipe calls for roofies  To your point  Last night I was at a dinner  Where Bill Clinton spoke  And he's of course  Outrageously eloquent  And charismatic  And women were just  Flocking to him  You meet him?  I can't imagine  I met him  Took a picture with him  He was like  Get in my way buddy  You're not as cute as this one  No, not really  He was very, very charming  But there was a person  Next to me  He was talking about  How his son  In fourth grade  Asked him what teabagging was  Because he heard about it  At school 
[03:11:00]  And so his father  Freaked out  And then said  And then said  I just told him  What it was  And I used  Very scientific terms  And then all of a sudden  He was like  Can you pass the mashed potatoes  Please  Because when you  When you just treat it  As nothing  It's not taboo anymore  No one cares  So I guess  That's what happened  To you guys  Until ten years later  When the kid was  Attacking joggers  With a hammer  And teabagged him  When they profile him  Yeah on regular radio  We used to do a lot of  Outrageous live stuff 
[03:11:30]  So it hurt  We'd have girls in here  And lock them in 55 gallon drums  Well now that there's a new pope  There's a whole new level  Of opportunity for you  Well that's true  Now we'll stay away  From the churches  I think that's  That was a biggie  That's one of those taboos  That even XM won't put up with  And we've done it already  We've got to move on  Being in a reality show  Now you're doing your own radio show  Is it a big difference  Because like the whole  Nature of the set up  Well yeah  I'm more in control  Of the content obviously  I have to be very careful  Because it is live  There's a seven second delay 
[03:12:00]  That I found out  Wasn't working once  When I dropped the F-bomb  About three months ago  What are you saying  Like fucking roast beef  No I saw it  It's not a fucking show  For God's sake  I don't use that word anymore  You know what I did  After I said that  And I said it  In the beginning of the show  I said it's effing beautiful  Here in California  I was in California  And I said it  At the beginning of the show  So for the whole hour  I was trembling  You can't imagine  How nervous I was  And now what I do  Is if I ever say it  I pay someone  Who I say it in front of  A hundred dollars  And after six thousand dollars  I stop saying it  Really? 
[03:12:30]  So now you just  Don't say it at all  It's just  It's out of my vocabulary  Almost to ninety five percent  Not even through regular life  Almost ninety five percent  Out of my vocabulary  There's just no reason for it  I'm just going to take it out  So I don't make that mistake again  Because it can ruin my career  On radio  I don't feel that cunt  You know what  That's a word I never say  Warning  Warning  Sealed  Alert  Sealed  Warning  Warning  Warning  Sorry  I'm not even sure  I know what that means  Does that actually have a definition  Anywhere?  Oh you know it when you see it  Yeah it's  Yeah exactly  When you deal with it  You're a mid-level manager 
[03:13:00]  You know it when you whisper it  Under your breath  Because she's just left the room  In a huff  Also known as the atom bomb  Right?  That's a rough one  And it's usually  You know  It's usually preceded by  F-ing  You F-ing  See  You know  And then they always hear it  They're super  That's the argument stopper  Morocco has left the building  Yeah  He's a nice guy  What if he can  I got a big female audience  It's just the way the language is  It's just language  And some people use it  More than all  Our whole goal is to make sure  He never gets laid again  Oh good luck  So we want him to say 
[03:13:30]  Some really bad stuff on our show  Great smile  Nice fella  Are you okay?  Do you need me to do something for you?  Oh no no no  I'm not saying that  I'm just saying  I will understand sometimes  Two men look at each other  And acknowledge things  You know what's funny  About being out of the restaurant business  Is that I have all this time now  I cook more now  Than I did when I ran three restaurants  For people at home  Family, friends  Dinner parties  It's a lot of fun  I worked in a restaurant once  And it sucked  I mean it's just 
[03:14:00]  The worst possible job  To ever have  It's  Your schedule is  You can't go into work  And know how much work you have  And work at some pace  To get it done  Or maybe put it off  Until tomorrow  If you get in that rush thing  You have to work faster  Than sometimes you possibly can  Here you're essentially  Trying to achieve  The impossible every day  With an innumerable amount  Of variables  I mean people's personalities  Ingredients changing  Lighting  It's outrageous  And they're just orders  Coming in one after another 
[03:14:30]  And it doesn't stop  And you're getting backed up  That kind of pressure  Uh-uh  It's trying to run  For me  It's like being Martha Stewart  And trying to run  A perfect household  Every single night  For 300 guests  Every single night  Non-stop  I was going to go in the restaurant business  With my friends  I'm like  I don't want the restaurant  I had to sit down  And order a meal  So guys  Look forward to a new show  I'm working on a new show  It's going to be reality-ish  But hosting it  And uh  What's that?  Hopefully you'll like it  Soon to be announced 
[03:15:00]  Let's say  And uh  What's the whole gist?  The gist is um  I don't know if I can talk about the gist  The gist isn't finished yet  Really?  Just basic?  You can't even give a hint?  Uh  I'm reforming  I'm reforming people  Reforming  Fat people come in  And try to order food  And humiliate them  Until they leave  Reforming restaurateurs  You know  Thanks to my great  And sometimes not so great experience  Did you uh  Did you get um  Like  Did you lose a lot of money  In the whole thing  The restaurant business?  Uh  Because I remember reading 
[03:15:30]  We made a little money  At Union Pacific  And that was a great experience  Obviously  Because I achieved a dream  Of getting three stars  In the New York Times  And a lot of good  Good stuff came out of that  Uh  Legal fees last year  Weren't uh  Weren't uh  Cheap  Let's just say that  Yeah  You had a problem with a partner  Yeah  Legal fees were astronomical  I can't imagine  I never knew you could spend  That much on  Oh it's amazing isn't it  Yeah  It is amazing  How many stars is possible  At the Times  Three stars?  Four  And there are only  Five four star restaurants  And our goal was  Three for that restaurant  Four is nearly impossible 
[03:16:00]  To do  What constitutes a four star restaurant?  It's a combination of  Beautiful dining room  Per impeccable service  Imaginative food  And it all  You know  Hitting on every cylinder  Every single night  All the time  Non-stop perfection  You ever hear of  Sushi Nozawa in L.A.?  I have  Yes  So that's the place  I eat at in L.A.  Oh  How good is that  Compared to  The sushi Nazi  Yeah  He just serves you  What he wants to serve you  And if you don't like  He tells you to get the hell out  Oh really  Really?  That's the guy I'm talking about  He's been written up in the Times  And he's supposed to be  Like one of the best in the country  What if you want like  A spicy tuna roll?  No  You know 
[03:16:30]  I don't make spicy tuna roll  You go  You go  That's it  He threw out  That he's thrown out  I make hamachi croissant today  Take it or leave it  Wow  That's basically it  But it's really good stuff  If you like sushi  You know  If you like sushi  You like all of it  So what  You just sit down  And he decides  By looking at you  What you want  At the sushi bar  It's called Trust Me  You sit down  And he just serves you  If you want to order something  You can request it at the table  But I saw one guy  Try to question something  He goes  Oh you ask too much  Table  Table  You ask too much  Really?  Yeah  This guy wants to  He had an internment campaign  But what if he's in a bad mood that day 
[03:17:00]  And just wants to give you something  That he knows you're not going to want  So here's the thing  His fish is impeccable every day  He throws out all the fish  At the end of the night  In the garbage  It might be fresh that morning  It's always fresh that morning  And he throws in the garbage  So his point is  I go to extremes  To get you the best product out there  Don't even dare  You're not qualified  Question me  And they follow  Other chefs will follow him  To see where he's shopping  And where he's buying his sushi  So I just wanted to get  Like a confirmation from a real chef  You know he's outrageous  He's absolutely amazing  I mean it's  It's a really low key restaurant 
[03:17:30]  It's in a strip mall  It's not that expensive  It's not very beautiful  But it's  It's a temple of sushi  Can you enjoy going out eating  Or are you just super critical  I love going out to eat  I used to be super critical  I can't imagine like  You go out and just look  At every little thing  I enjoy TGIF  You know good for you  Good for you  Have you seen those new ads  For TGIF  No  You haven't seen them  Where they walk in  With the music  Here I am  You haven't seen that one  No  The three hot girls walk in  Oh yeah yeah  And then they bring the fajitas out  Or something  And the song starts  And the guys would rather 
[03:18:00]  Look at the fajitas coming  Than they would the hot chicks  That are walking by  I spend about $300 a week  On eating  With who  At minimum  If you live in New York City  It's three four five nights a week  I'm not kidding  And that's not even going crazy  That's just eating  Because I don't cook for myself  So I'm spending easily $300 a week eating  It's just chicken  Or you're looking at  You know all the presentation on this one  Isn't quite what I  Absolutely not  I used to do that  And in my 20s  I did that a lot  And I found that it was boring  All of my guests to death  Look at this  Exactly  I can't believe that waitress just did that  That's unacceptable 
[03:18:30]  In my restaurant  That'll never happen  And they'd be like  Please Rocco  Can we never go to dinner again  What's a really good place to go eat  Well there's a couple places I like  I love Balthazar  I think it's fantastic  I love  I love La Bernadette  Just got four stars again  If you want like a temple  Of haute cuisine  Great fish  La Bernadette is the one  I love Cafe Ballou  Is it expensive  La Bernadette is very expensive  Yeah  It's a very high level restaurant  If you want to go for  That kind of an experience  Like they have the buffet 
[03:19:00]  Could two people have a nice meal  I need the buffet  It's about $6,000 a person  How much would it be to eat there  For two people  $400 or $500  Wow  It could be $300  If you don't buy expensive wine  But I think the prefix menu  Is $70, $80  What's the deal with the sushi place  In the towers  In Columbus Circle there  Oh  Ginza Sushi Co  Yeah  It's more performance art  Than a restaurant  And I've been to the Ginza Sushi Co  In Beverly Hills  Which was a lot smaller  Than this one  And it's really performance art  It's like $1,000 a person  Just to get in  It's about $700 a person 
[03:19:30]  Wow  No it's about $700 or $800 for two  To eat?  Yeah  Look at Jimmy  To eat  He wants a manual release  A massage  A happy ending  You can get one of those  For a lot less  Yeah right  I mean with sushi included  That is ridiculous  But what's the deal with that  It's just $800  Well here's the thing  This guy prepares everything himself  He's the only chef in the kitchen  He's in the center  Of a stage sushi bar  It's really performance art  You'll never see anything like it  In your life  And if you want that experience  You know once or twice in your life  That's the place to go  There's nothing like it out there 
[03:20:00]  It is rare  It's uncommon  He is the only one that does it  How's the food?  And the food is exceptional  I mean it's outrageous  But it must take a long time  To get this one guy doing it  You must be like  Well that's the thing  He only cooks for five, six, seven people at once  I mean  Yeah  This is a restaurant that's packed with 200 people  He only has I think 10 seats at a sushi bar  You can't even go in really  Yeah  What a gimmick  You have 10 seats  You've got to charge hundreds of dollars per seat  Exactly right  How's Il Molino?  You know they only make a few Ferraris  That's what they can get 300 grand each  Il Molino's pretty good  Okay  Yeah I think it's okay 
[03:20:30]  I think it might be  A tad overrated  A tad overrated  And a tad expensive  That was Chef's way of going  Il Molino just stinks  That's what comedians do  What do you think of him?  Nah the crowd likes him  If you want an Italian restaurant  I love Beppe  Cersei Casella on 22nd Street  Beppe is a great place  Do you have a restaurant in New York?  No I had three  I was running three until December 24th  We sold Union Pacific  And that's it for me for restaurants  I'm done  You ever been to Le Routier  No  Up there on Amsterdam  Le Routier  No no no  Yeah it's a French restaurant  You go there  Ask for the chef 
[03:21:00]  Yeah  Mark and  Well he won't get a free meal  What happens  Let me ask you a question  If you had friends  You'd invite them to your restaurant  Would you comp their meal  If they were your friends  I used to come down  I was very generous in my restaurant  That's cool  Very very generous  To a fault probably  I give away a lot of drinks  Caviar truffles  Compoil dinners  Really?  You know when you feed people for a living  It's hard not to be generous  Yeah well it isn't  If your name is Mark  And then my 26 partners would say  Rocco  There is some money to be made here  Can you please let us do it?  Were some of your partners  Getting pissed off 
[03:21:30]  That you were really the face  And getting the  No variety  And popularity  I think  Their strategy was  To get publicity  Around me  And make me the centerpiece  Of the restaurant  In terms of the personality  Every restaurant is a personality  How could a restaurant fail  If we got this much promotion  And publicity  And we had eight good years  So you know  While some restaurants  Few succeed longer than that  I mean there are a handful  Gramercy Tavern  Le Cirque  We thought it was a really good run  And now it's going to become  A great restaurant  It's going to be called BLT Prime  Laurent Tourndale 
[03:22:00]  Is going to run it  He just got three stars  In the Times today  Actually for BLT Fish  Do you have you guys  Ever spoken about food  For this long on your show?  Yeah this stinks  No  I know  Looking forward to tears  I don't mind it  I like it  I want to take a chick out to eat  I want to know  I like trash  As the rest of the country  Going I'll never be to need  Yeah well let the rest of the country  Give me some pussy  He's helping  No matter how dumb you are  Ugly you are  Fat you are  If you cook for a girl  You've really got some  You've got good chances  You raise the odds  Significantly  We're going to let you be  We've got to move on here 
[03:22:30]  Yeah move on  So what are we promoting today  Let's move on  From your most boring  Radio interview ever in history  No no no  What station  WR is  What station on the dial  WR is 710 AM  11 to 12 every day  It's called Food Talk with Rocco  And you call in  And you're promoting something  But you're not ready  To talk about it yet  Well I've got a lot of things  In the works  I've got a new book  Coming out in September  TV show  A bunch of products  But the radio station  Is what's really important  Have you banged any famous girls  I don't have sex  No  Never  I'm abstinent  I took a vow of abstinence 
[03:23:00]  A vow of celibacy  A celibacy  When I was in seminary high school  I went to Cathedral Prep Seminary  And they got me  And that was it  I'm waiting for marriage  You are such a liar  That's great  You noticed I wasn't looking at you  When I said that  No  Of course  He's in the back of a cab right now  Look I fed you  Alright with that  Let's thank Rocco  For stopping by  Thank you Rocco  We greatly appreciate it  It looks really nice of you  Thank you  Take care guys  Good luck to you  And we'll continue  And end this show next  It is a natural impulse 
[03:23:30]  To grab and squeeze  Squeeze the bread  Squeeze the bread  No shit  It's real real soft  Almost like pudding  Almost like pudding  Yes  The hard piece of ass  Quite a handful  Yeah  The nipples are so sensitive  Yeah  That a mere tweak  Between finger and thumb  Will give a perfectly good result  We all be an Anthony show  In case you didn't nudge  XM202  The O.B. and Anthony show  Something do you believe 
[03:24:00]  Will you fight the hand that seems  Will you chew until it bleeds  Can you get up off your knees  Are you brave enough to see  Do you want to change it  That was us trying to compete  With the Martha Stewart acquisition 
[03:24:30]  From Sirius  That was us right there  With having Rocco on  Oh yeah  That was us trying to compete  Of course  That's all we're trying to do  These days  Well the script for the commercial  Has come in  Oh boy  And boy I'd love to know  Who wrote this  I'd love to know  Who wrote  You think we don't see  What this is  Yep  Are you fucking joking  Here's what it is  Open on a close up  Of XM  MyFi on white  The screen reads  O.B. and Anthony  Camera moves back  To reveal more of the product  As we hear a portion 
[03:25:00]  Of the O.B. and Anthony broadcast  What they've done  Is they've put a couple of options  For O.B. and Anthony  It's a very quick commercial  Each one will have  One or two lines  Uh huh  Do you want to read it  Do you guys want to  Just do the first one  Yeah I'm going to read  My line  Alright do the first one  Alright why don't you  Set it up again  Give us the visual  You do that first part  And then when we have to talk  We'll talk  Open on a close up  Of the XM to go  MyFi on white  The screen reads  O.B. and Anthony  The camera moves back  To reveal more of the product  As we hear a portion 
[03:25:30]  Of an O.B. and Anthony broadcast  XM gave us our own show again  It's no coincidence  They also give you  Channel blocking  And then it says laughter  O.B. and Anthony are back  Only on XM Satellite Radio  And then there's the legal  Bottom of the screen  Of the product  Which is probably 
[03:26:00]  You know  Blah blah blah  Whatever  Hey but guys  They do give you  Some other alternate scripts  Let's go with option number two  Alright  Maybe it's completely different  Alright  Now that we have our  Show on XM  Calls for channel blocking  Will skyrocket  Yeah let's go with option three  Option three  We have a show on XM 
[03:26:30]  XM has channel blocking  Everyone is happy  Hey let's go with option four  XM  Oh they're gonna make me say put  In a national TV spot  Yeah  Are they insane  What's option number four  Oh I'm sorry  XM put us back on the air  Channel blocking  Is through the roof  Alright what's option number five  We now have our own show on XM  Two words  Channel blocking  What's the matter  You fucking worried  You think people don't know  That you're just trying  To let people know  Hey guys  We know that they're bad 
[03:27:00]  But you don't have to accept them  What kind of backhanded  Bullshit is that  I agree  Wholeheartedly  You think we don't know  What that is  Hey try to make it funny  And get the message across  That hey you don't have to  Have these slobs  Right  That's what it is  They're so scared  Little scaredy cat  In there going  Well it's a commercial  It's gonna be on TV  Oh other people are gonna  We better talk about  How you cannot hear  These people  Yeah  Really really really  Really aggressive way  To market it  Over urinals  And hey channel blocking 
[03:27:30]  Is available guys  Wait we got advertising  Over urinals  Yeah you know  They're actually  A pretty good idea  Channel blocking  Channel blocking  Block the channel  We fucking get it  Channel blocking  Every single option  That's why  Opie  That is why  Our last session  That we recorded  Was not accepted  By XM  If I were you  I would absolutely  Refuse to read this  Awful copy  I'm gonna go in  And record stuff  And I will not be  Saying two words 
[03:28:00]  Channel  And blocking  You know what  Channel blocking is  When you're trying  To fuck a channel  And her fat channel  Friend is standing  There interrupting  That's channel blocking  This stinks  Are you trying to say  That Squiz is blocking  Our entertainment value  I know exactly  What this is  And you know it is too  Well yeah  Don't try to put it  In joke form  You think I'm a comic  You think I don't know  In joke form  What you're really  Trying to tell the truth  Two words  And hide behind a laugh  Two words  Channel blocking  Yeah  Cause that will get  A big laugh 
[03:28:30]  It lets everybody  Know they're back on  But  And here's the asterisk  It lets everybody  Know that you can  Block them  Why do you need  To let the public  Know that there  Is that option  When you're sending  Out internal emails  Everybody who has  XM knows that  That's your way  Of pacifying  Anybody who might  Give you bullshit  This show tells it  Every break  Alright here we go  Here's the voice of reason  I used to be like Jimmy  Uh huh  There's a couple things  That are going to happen here  We will not be  Saying channel blocking  That's obvious  Okay  The other thing is 
[03:29:00]  If you know  We do work for XM  And if they need to  Have a TV commercial  That mentions channel blocking  That's their call  But  But to have us  Actually say it  Ain't going to happen  I'm sorry about that guys  And the other thing is  Another example of why  No one is running  This channel  Because none of this  Has been discussed  With Anthony and I  And we would have  Gave our opinions on this  And then we would have  Been able to work out  A better solution to this  But once again 
[03:29:30]  No one is running  High voltage 202  I just wish  Somebody had the balls  To finally say  What is unspoken  I wish somebody  Would have the courage  The moral courage  To say what is unspoken  About that internal vibe  About this show  I wish somebody  In corporate America  Had a fucking  Summounce of mortal  Moral fortitude  To just say  This is what  We don't like the show  We like it  We know it's valuable  Yet  We understand it's so offensive 
[03:30:00]  We don't want to put  Our logo behind it  Even though we kind of  Have to in some instances  Well I got to talk  With Eric Logan  After the show  We really need a guy  To dig in  And really take control  Here and work this channel  And have an open discussion  With Anthony and I  On a daily basis  Because then it would have  Been very obvious  That this is just  Unacceptable  But you know  For some reason  This channel  Is running itself  And it's time  To really  Really get someone  In here  That's going to 
[03:30:30]  Focus on this  It's time  The theme  Is  Well this has got  Nothing to do  With someone running  The channel  This is somebody  In marketing  Or somewhere else  Who wrote this  And thought it was funny  It's fucking  It's not that bad  I mean look  If you want to talk  About channel blocking  Maybe you should read  That with your baseball promos  Hey if you don't  If you don't want to  Listen to this  How your children  Will shoot steroids  And do illegal drugs  Fuck you  This stinks  Alright  Jimmy seems to have  Done away with  One of the scripts  That's terrible  Do you have that 
[03:31:00]  On your comedy thing  Every three seconds  It's language  It's only language  Yeah how about that  The comedy channel  Is uncensored  The Excel comedy channel  Yeah  And they mention  That you can block it  And you should be able  To block it  Parents should have a say  In what their kids  Listen to  That's one thing  I love about XM  Is they do have that option  But how about the  TV commercial  Being something  That just gets people  On board  Because they will hear  That we are on XM  And they'll subscribe  To XM  Because they enjoy this show 
[03:31:30]  How about just  Leaving it that  How about just  Giving us a god damn  Commercial for ten seconds  Where it's just about  How the show is  It's funny  It's entertaining  You'll want to listen  Listen to them on XM  Does it have to  Throw in this  Oh it's channel  But we need to  Let them know  They could not  Listen to it  If they don't want to  Pacifying dog shit  Someone that works  For the company  Has to understand  What we're all about  If you want to do  I'm serious  If you want to do  The channel blocking  Thing that's fine  That's your prerogative 
[03:32:00]  Or whatever  But it doesn't make sense  To have Anthony and I  Then make your own commercial  Say O&A  We're making a commercial  For you  You guys aren't involved  We'll do a voiceover thing  A graphic  And we'll talk about  Channel blocking  You want to do it  Fine  That's fine  But have me and Opie  Go in there  I don't need  To be on TV  That badly  This just can't be  Are you that embarrassed  By the show  We can't  We can't be a part  Of the whole  Channel blocking thing  Where we're actually  Saying it  We just can't  And there's got to be 
[03:32:30]  A guy  I've got to say it again  That we need  A go to guy  That is going to  You know  Come to us with this script  Maybe  I don't know  A couple days ago  I mean  We are  We are being handed  This script  A half hour  Before we have to  Go in another room  And record this  And by the way  Why is there no  Asteriskness to  The Bob Edwards show  Hey how about this  Bob Edwards  It's only an hour  Why don't you say that  Why is that  You're that embarrassed  By the show  That people don't  Even mention it publicly  That it's not included  In the email  And I don't want to hear that 
[03:33:00]  Oh well you know  The email  You don't want to be  Included in a rate hike  Really so you're  Protecting the show  By not mentioning it  In a rate hike  Instead of explaining  To people  Look  If you really believed  In the show  You would feel  That it helped  Justify a rate hike  But you don't  That has gotten  A little better  I just saw an ad  In Entertainment Weekly  I know they're going  To advertise  But this type of shit  Big full page ad  And they have  Opie and Anthony  Included  Absolutely  They're starting  To include our channel  And the name of the show  What I'm talking about  Is an underlying vibe 
[03:33:30]  That this show is bad  Or that it's awful  Or that there are  Certain people in the company  I'm not talking about  Eric Logan  There are certain people  In the company  Who are embarrassed by it  And don't want to be  Associated with it  And that's what this  Reluctance is  That's right  I know that the ads  And the times were great  The ads and the posts  Are great  All that stuff's great  Yeah  But this type of shit  Just brings back  That that attitude  Is still there  That has permeated  Since we started  Well  Yeah we'll pass on this  No problem  We don't need a 10 second  TV spot  Yeah  How long ago 
[03:34:00]  By the way  Did you record  Those first spots  I don't know  A month ago maybe  Yeah  At least  I said a week later  It should have gotten back to you  Actually it might have been  Like two months ago  Right  Yeah  I really don't know  So it's  You know  It's just  There's just no one in charge  It's what it comes down to  We shouldn't be handed  The script  Where I mean  You know  How about emailing it to you  For approval  Before they hand it to you  Or did this work  Well  You know  Obviously this would be  Something that  We'd have a problem with  It's awful 
[03:34:30]  And if you knew us  In the show  You know  That would be very obvious to you  Dude it's somebody  Who thought it would be  Like a funny way  They actually thought  That you guys are so dumb  That the true motive behind it  Would fly under the  Radar  Yeah  You understand what I'm saying  Dude  Us reading  Us reading a script  About channel blocking  We would  We would  Sound just as awkward  As those hostage guys  Talking about how great  Allah it is  There you go  Channel blocking  L-O-L  R-A-O-F 
[03:35:00]  Look guys  It's fun  It's channel blocking  Yeah  You know  Let's them know  You're dangerous  And edgy  They're using like  Basic child psychology  On us  It's sickening  It's sickening  Well the weird thing  Is I ask Ben  I'm like  Where's the script  I mean  What do they want from us  And for some reason  There was no real answer  Oh it's  We don't have it yet  And they're coming  And now  Now I know why  How about somebody  Emails the script  Why couldn't that be emailed  Hey any changes  You want to make here 
[03:35:30]  Channel blocking  Because there's dirty language  The appeal of satellite radio  Is no commercials  And complete freedom  And yet  Let's panic  About the complete language freedom  Uh huh  Channel blocking  I understand  I understand  That there's a need  For channel blocking  And it's good  That they have it  Absolutely  But this obsession  Especially with allowing  The public to know it  In a TV commercial  You're talking to people  Who don't have XM 
[03:36:00]  Yeah  Why do you need  To let them know  They can block the channel  Why is that necessary  Unless  Unless  You're trying to pacify  Or cut off any problems  That you may foresee  Well a general philosophy too  When you have a show like ours  You want to kind of  Fly under the radar  As long as possible  Absolutely  You don't want to like  Just you know  Throw it out there  For everybody  Because then everyone's  Going to be like  Oh wait a minute  Yeah  Wait a minute  Open app channel blocking  Wait a minute  This is somebody  Who doesn't like the show  This is something I need  To write my local congressman about  Somebody who doesn't like the show  Doesn't like the show 
[03:36:30]  That says  You know  I don't like it  I want  People to know  That they don't have to listen to it  They can still get XM  Yeah  I want to use this commercial  Maybe they'll get XM  But I want them to know  They don't have to listen to this  It's subtle dog shit  With somebody who  Again  As a man  Or as a woman  Or an adult  Wouldn't have the moral courage  To go look  I don't like the show  Yeah  Somebody who would nod their head yes  Because they're corporate  And that's what corporate people do  But can't acknowledge  That they don't like it  But perhaps other people do  Oh you guys are arrogant  You're cocky 
[03:37:00]  You think we don't know  That you think that  Just God almighty  At least we're honest  We tell the truth about how we feel  Alright  That's all we ask  Is somebody just be truthful  About the way you feel  Alright we made our point  What's this 911 thing about  Oh no  It's about  I'll be fast  Before we get out of here  Some 911 operator  I guess it was a woman  Called up  Having trouble with her ex  Has a restraining order  Against him  He's at the door  She calls 911  Apparently there were no cops  To send over there  And this woman  911 operator 
[03:37:30]  Just puts it so eloquently  With her  With her fine speech  We need a police car  Here in the American  This guy  My daughter  Has been strained on you  I understand that ma'am  Y'all call  I understand that  But right now  We really really  Do not have nobody  And I've been trying  My best  To get a cop car  To y'all  And we really  Do not have nobody  We do not have police officers  You have to take that  Up with the mayor  You might want to 
[03:38:00]  Take that up  With the mayor  You don't have cops  To send here  Take it up  I like that  You know  We don't have nobody  We don't have nobody  To send to y'all  Well that's  That's Ebonics  That's perfectly acceptable  She's an idiot  But I don't think  She did anything wrong  I mean  It's not her fault  That there's no cops  No no  It's not her fault  I'm just saying  Who the hell  Do they hire  For this 911 stuff  Yeah  Perhaps you should  Be able to speak  You articulate  Oh my god  We don't have nobody  We don't have nobody  If someone's saying  We don't have nobody 
[03:38:30]  Perhaps they're not  The person for the job  Yep  On the phone  Perhaps they're not  Going to be  As resourceful  As quick  As they need to be  To respond  In certain situations  As quick to  Perhaps  Convey  The emergency  That has  Has been called  In to them  To the people  That need  To be told  What the emergency  Is  Perhaps she can't  Articulate  Yo we don't  Have nobody  But we do  Have channel  Blocking  Uh huh 
[03:39:00]  We got that  Channel blocking  If we need that  For y'all  Yeah it's like  I don't know  This woman  Called  She got some  Problem with  Some mans  Oh  We ain't got nobody  Or I'll send  Them over  To shoot you  Uh huh  Perhaps they need  To give a little  More money  To the 911  Program so they  Can hire some  People that  Yeah  I don't know  I don't think  It's a big deal  You know  No no  It's an underlying  Thing there  Yeah  I don't really  Think it's that  Important  Alright 
[03:39:30]  Um  Not as important  As our company  By the way  You know  I've been doing  Radio since I was  18 and I've done  I've done everything  From be the production  Guy believe it or not  I sold for a little  While  I did promotions  And marketing  And uh  There's just a bunch  Of dummies  In marketing  Because what this  TV spot should  Really be  Is if it's only  10 seconds  Then it should be  Just a few seconds  Of audio of our show  Doing something  Cool or whatever  Something interesting 
[03:40:00]  Something that just  Catches your attention  Yeah  And then have  Somebody with the  Big booming voice  Say the channel  Blocking and all that  No you don't have  You might get  Legal underneath  You write it  In legal  You don't say  You don't waste  Air time saying  But I'm just saying  You know  To waste our time  You know  To talk about  Channel blocking  When it should be  Us as the artist  Quote  Uh you know  Doing something  That's uh  Wow look at that  Oh wow  That was  No I'm just  Oh ha ha ha  No I'm just saying  Because it would be  A TV spot or whatever  Go oh wow  That caught my attention  Open Anthony  Oh  And then channel blocking 
[03:40:30]  Blah blah blah  You don't waste  A line of booming voice  So if you have it  In the legal  So people can  Or whatever  But as far as us  Getting involved  With that part of a TV spot  That's just ridiculous  I mean  We're technically  The talent  So just have a  Showcase our talent  Which would be  Probably just simple  Audio from the show  That is interesting  Of course  And then go from there  It's just a bunch of dopes  You don't have the driver  On the car commercials  Going professional driver  On a closed course  Do not attempt this  In your own vehicle 
[03:41:00]  That's written in the bottom  Yeah  You know this satellite radio  Thing is growing  By leaps and bounds  And now it's time  To get some people  Involved that actually  Know how to do this  Yes  I think satellite radio  Was a dumping ground  For a lot of people  That were not doing  Too well in commercial radio  But that's changing now  Because a lot of  You know the guys  Like Anthony and I  That were very successful  In commercial radio  Are now moving over there  So it's time to get rid  Of some of these  Some of these deadweights  That ah  Look  You know  They couldn't get hired 
[03:41:30]  In the commercial world  But you know  We're trying to make  This satellite thing happen  You know  That's how it all began  Two years ago  That's how a lot of these  People got  You know  Put in place  Anthony  Yeah  You know  It wasn't like  The guys that really  Know how to do  Were willing to  Give up on their  On their lucrative  Job in commercial radio  To come over  Right  It was something  That was unproven  But now it's  Being proven  And now we gotta  Hire  More talented people  Last half hour  The show sucked 
[03:42:00]  Thank you  Program complete  To come over </pre>
