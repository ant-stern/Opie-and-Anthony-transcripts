<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts' usual sexually charged banter, featuring Jim Norton, and focused heavily on their frustrations with their FM radio station's management.  This included sexually explicit jokes and discussions of pornography. Anthony declared his newfound admiration for Kevin Federline, insulting Britney Spears in the process.  A significant portion was devoted to mocking a list of "Ways to Improve the Program" from program director John Minnelli, which the hosts ridiculed, culminating in a humorous scenario of broadcasting from a bathroom due to a suggested studio downsize.  Anthony offered $100 (plus a bonus for untrimmed pubic hair) to any woman willing to strip naked on air, defying perceived arbitrary company policy.  The hosts contrasted their negative FM experience with their positive relationship with XM Satellite Radio, citing listener satisfaction research.  The show also prominently featured Anthony's viral Windows Vista installation video and a stunt where they called Tyra Banks a "fat pig" on live television.  The Super Bowl was discussed, with Opie referencing his "sports curse" and the unusual circumstances of the game (all rain, first loss by a Black coach), leading to commentary on racial overemphasis in current events.  The broadcast used highly offensive language throughout.


The show continued with a two-pronged attack on their network's perceived lack of support. The hosts angrily complained about the absence of a Super Bowl promotional spot, despite their show's large local viewership, and their belief that local news promos were prioritized over them. They disparaged Super Bowl commercials, ironically praising a Kevin Federline ad.  This segment transitioned into an extremely graphic and detailed account of a Brazilian wax performed on a staff member, E-Rock, who lost a UFC bet.  A female waxer, Nicole, was brought into the studio for the procedure, which was described in explicit detail, including E-Rock's reactions and the hosts' crude commentary.  The waxing included E-Rock's chest and various other body parts.  The hosts repeatedly discussed the show's nudity rules and the $100 offer for a nude woman in the studio.  They also reviewed the movie "Babel," including descriptions of its nudity.  Various tangents, caller interactions, and comedic bits involving studio staff, including the use of a short audio clip, filled out the segment.


Following this, a significant portion detailed a painful and comical underarm waxing incident involving Opie, Anthony, Nicole, and a male guest ("Iraq"), whose arms became stuck to his body due to the wax.  The hosts' descriptions of the sounds and Iraq's reactions were graphic and humorous. The segment continued with a discussion about a rejected bit, "So Your Pussy's Got Talent," involving a female guest and vaginal objects.  The hosts expressed intense frustration and anger at XM's lawyers for rejecting the bit, engaging in a heated on-air argument with their executive producer, Steve, about corporate policies and perceived hypocrisy within both XM and their previous terrestrial radio station. They reiterated their intention to defy the restrictions. The excerpt also included brief mentions of Anthony's Vista video, a lunch dispute with an employee named Bill, and listener feedback.


The show concluded with an aggressive and insulting dismissal of a listener, Mike Siciliano, who criticized the show. The hosts mocked his radio aspirations and past attempts. This was followed by a humorous, yet inaccurate, debate on lunar phases and eclipses, utilizing a flashlight and a bouncy ball. A listener mistakenly addressed the radio instead of the phone, providing a comedic moment.  A Groundhog Day-themed bit saw Anthony expressing violent hatred for Punxsutawney Phil.  A significant portion involved the discovery by a police officer, Keith, of a lost document belonging to Master Poe, a driver for one of the hosts, which led to a drawn-out, playful reveal, ending on a cliffhanger. Jim Norton was in studio, sharing anecdotes about his sobriety and rehab, contrasting it with Miss USA Tara Conner's brief rehab stay. A caller's midget sighting was also discussed.  The broadcast ended with Jim Norton promoting his sexually explicit "Professor Jim Norton" segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Obi and Anthony, XM202.  For failure, it's the most annoying thing on two legs.  What a whore fest.  Who cares about the funny?  Just bring me the porn.  Aren't we dumb?  He hee.  Obi.  Oh, do you want to play?  Anthony.  I will beat children about the head.  Jim Norton.  I'm dancing.  I'm dancing.  I'm just, I'm a naked whore.  It's indescribable.  I'm trying.  It's like a rape that's covered by insurance.  Some of the comments they make are uncalled for.  Why are you crying?  The virus finally hit him. 
[00:00:30]  But with Jimmy, you never know.  It could be AIDS.  No.  Yes.  Yes.  It's the Obi and Anthony show.  The virus that spreads from town to town across the U.S. of A.  And.  I hate you.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  I want to announce that I am a K-Fed fan. 
[00:01:00]  Wow.  Camp K-Fed.  You're on his team.  He's turned me.  I guess you watched the Super Bowl and saw his commercial. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was the highlight for me.  Twelve hours of coverage.  The highlight for me was the K-Fed commercial.  Yeah.  Camp K-Fed.  I'm in his camp.  Get me a T-shirt.  Britney stinks.  K-Fed's the better father.  You watch.  You watch.  K-Fed is going to have a career.  K-Fed's career is going to blow up now because of that.  And she's going to be in the gutter somewhere in another year. 
[00:02:00]  I hear she's doing a Vegas act.  That's what she's up to.  Yeah.  She's honing herself to get back on stage and do some kind of Vegas thing.  Yeesh.  That'll be the equivalent of when Fat Elvis showed up in Vegas.  And everyone remembered the skinny, rocking Elvis in his leather suit.  And they're going to get the big, fat, gaudy Elvis.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll be talking about the Super Bowl today, of course.  Good morning.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  The O&A virus spreading across America. 
[00:02:30]  It's a bit colder in Chicago this morning.  Oh, and more ways than one.  Let me see.  Hold on.  Hold on.  It's a bit colder in Chicago this morning.  Just throwing a little sound effect in.  Sorry.  Chicago, give us a call, will you?  We want to hear from you this morning.  Well, we got lots to do today.  Oh, certainly do.  My God.  I don't know how we'll do it.  You know, we might have to make some adjustments as to how we do it. 
[00:03:00]  But what are you talking about?  Well, Opie, I'm just talking about a little list I have here in front of me.  Opie Sports Curse, Tyrus Fat, Ants Vista Video, First Black Super Bowl Loser, Deaf Girls  Equal Nymphs.  We will get to all this stuff on today's Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah, it was supposed to stretch out for like 20 minutes.  That part is supposed to stretch out for 20 minutes?  I would assume.  Oh, boy.  The first 30 minutes of the show should be. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Holy aggravated.  I love it.  By the way, clear your calendar.  You'll get your effing meeting on Wednesday.  Me and Opie, Wednesday meeting.  Wednesday, yeah, okay.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's a lot of panicky Pete's around the Opie and Anthony Show.  Holy mother of God.  It's kind of strange.  How do we say this?  Well, we're on regular radio, and we're also on XM Satellite Radio at the same time. 
[00:04:00]  The bosses at XM Satellite Radio love us.  We can't do no wrong over there.  That's great.  Some research came out.  I don't know what I'm allowed to say, but beyond happy.  Yeah.  Very good.  The latest research at XM, as far as the Opie and Anthony Show goes, they are beyond happy.  Apparently, they did a lot of research that had to do with people's satisfaction with listening,  how they react to certain aspects of the show, like when we mention products and things like that, 
[00:04:30]  if they go out and actually buy them, buy the products, just listening habits of the program.  And then here on our FM station in New York City, our flagship station, if you will, we get a little list.  And here's the problem.  XM did a survey that they did, I think, three days ago. 
[00:05:00]  So it's the current information.  And, well, regular radio, free FM here in New York, I would bet a lot of money they didn't do any research.  Steve had to go, I guess it was Friday?  Yeah.  Friday, and meet with our program director here in New York City, John Minnelli.  And we knew he was going, so we sent him a little list of our own of things that we kind of need here to succeed 
[00:05:30]  and things that we're curious that we don't see around this station, just, you know, normal things that any radio station would do.  One example was the fact that we would like to see what happened to the radio station like Van and the guy that would go out with all the Wow! stickers and T-shirts.  And, you know, when you have a place like New York City, you know, one of the major hubs of the free world, 
[00:06:00]  there's usually something going on here in the city, right?  Pretty much the center of Rome.  Yeah, it's like there's always some event going on in this city that that van could pull up to and just start handing out stickers and T-shirts by the hundreds at a clip.  Jersey, go to Long Island, go to all the surrounding areas of the city and hand these out.  It's exposure. 
[00:06:30]  It's slap it on the car.  It's put a T-shirt on.  Whatever it takes.  Sweatshirt.  Anything.  We wanted to ask him about things like that.  We took about four years off from regular radio, about, and what I've noticed since coming back to regular radio,  especially here in New York, the laziness.  Yeah.  The laziness of a radio station in general.  In general.  And I don't mean to piss off people, but I've noticed a drastic change that's all about sales,  and it's not about actually pushing the product out on the streets of New York. 
[00:07:00]  Guerrilla marketing.  You do hand out the WOW stickers and the Opie and Anthony T-shirts and maybe T-shirts for the other shows around here and a prize closet.  Remember the days you used to have a prize closet and you had a good phone call?  You go, hey, buddy, $100 to the Apple store.  Here you go.  Thank you.  I'm going to give you a gift certificate to Applebee's.  I don't even think they – they don't even – what I'm getting at, they don't even have the – they don't even do the basics anymore.  No.  In regular radio. 
[00:07:30]  It's completely gone.  The only people that have not gotten lazy in radio is the sales staff.  They are now the alpha male of radio.  Yeah.  They are the jackal, the dominant thing, roaming the halls, just like biting anything else around that might be creative.  Well, that's why it's a pleasure to do XM Satellite Radio as well because, as you know, there's not many commercials on satellite.  And I'm not trying to turn this into a commercial for XM because they get nervous about that as well. 
[00:08:00]  They get all mad.  But what I will say is that we don't spend our time over there, you know, having sales meetings, discussing the latest client, and going over how you read their live read on the air.  We focus a lot more on trying to make the actual show better.  Over here, we don't really do that.  It's all about sales.  We end up in a lot of meetings, which, you know something for me?  It's fine.  I really – I don't mind meeting with clients and client meetings and stuff. 
[00:08:30]  I really – it doesn't bother me.  But don't make that the sole thing that you ever talk about to us.  I'm completely with you.  We understand that's part of the job.  Yeah.  Of course.  Of course.  But they're not doing actual research on the Opie and Anthony show, seeing what New Yorkers like or don't like about the show.  They're counting on an archaic way of measuring the audience.  It's very archaic.  Everyone knows.  And the rating system stinks. 
[00:09:00]  And we've said it before.  The people that know best about the Opie and Anthony show and when it needs a tweaking or adjusting on how we handle things is Opie and Anthony.  Right.  Like we've always kind of known if something needs to be adjusted, if we're doing this too much.  And it was always – remember in the old days, it was always the balance between sex and discussing other subject matter.  And we would sit there sometimes and go, I really think we're hitting the sex thing a little too much. 
[00:09:30]  And we would back off.  Kind of get that feel.  And we'd back off.  And then like three weeks later, after we've made that adjustment, some suit would come in and go, you guys are just pounding the sex too much on the thing.  Hey, three weeks ago we realized that and already made adjustments.  You are so delayed in your reaction.  So that brings us to this weekend with Steve's meeting with John Minnelli. 
[00:10:00]  And today's list of Opie and Anthony's show is the headline.  Ways to improve the program.  Ways to improve the program.  Yeah.  And then in little brackets, what are those called?  Parentheses.  Parentheses.  Yeah.  Suggestions by Free FM program director John Minnelli.  Okay.  And it's his suggestions on how to make the show better.  This is a collection of micromanagement that I just want to burn. 
[00:10:30]  This isn't ways to help the show.  And number one in itself proves these are stupid ideas.  Well, yeah.  And they ignore the stuff that we need to do.  Like, the people we're talking to right now want a dose of sex.  Of course they do.  They want sex talk.  Who doesn't want a dose of sex?  They don't want three hours of sex talk.  But they like maybe a nice segment on a regular basis. 
[00:11:00]  We understand it can't be graphic sex talk either.  They would like to hear girls that are desperate, completely naked, you know, crawling around a studio filled with mousetraps and cash.  Uh-huh.  It's one of the many bits that they said no to.  Can't do that.  For what reason?  I don't know.  A naked girl can't be in this studio.  Why?  How does that work?  And that has nothing to do with the FCC, by the way.  Nothing.  Today?  Nothing.  I'm giving $100 to a chick that comes up here and gets completely naked. 
[00:11:30]  Ooh.  I'll just give $100.  It's the easiest $100 you're going to earn.  Just come up.  Take your clothes off.  I'll give you $100.  You leave.  You don't have to say anything.  You don't have to.  I don't want your socks or shoes on.  Everything.  Just get naked.  I'll give you $100.  You leave.  There you go.  That's the offer for today.  I'll give an extra $100 if you haven't trimmed up.  Very good.  That'll be solely judged on. 
[00:12:00]  Extra $100 for that.  But just for the fact, I want to make a point.  I want to show that, yes, a nude girl can be in the studio without everyone losing their frigging minds and licenses and getting violations and everything else.  Because there is no FCC rule against having a nude girl in the studio.  It's company policy.  And I want to flush that one down the goddamn toilet.  There you go.  Couldn't say the word faggot for a while.  I'm like, boy.  Boy, that's real smart.  You want an edgy talk show and they're handcuffing your host by making sure they don't say the word faggot and the N-word. 
[00:12:30]  God forbid we say the N-word.  The big N-word that everyone knows what it is now.  Walk up to a black guy, by the way, and go, hey, you effing N-word.  You will get punched in the face just as if you use the word because now that has become the word.  That's right.  That's become the word.  That's right.  You could have just called it spatula.  You could have said, we're changing the N-word to spatula. 
[00:13:00]  And then you could just call them spatulas and you'd get punched in the face.  And they would all be calling each other, yo, my spatula.  Don't people understand you've made it into the new word for that is the N-word?  Don't you understand it?  We're going to need electroshock treatment for the entire country.  We've got to erase that word from everyone's brains.  That's the only way that stuff works, you dummies.  A lobotomy.  A lobotomy, sure.  I'd hate to be called a spatula lover. 
[00:13:30]  Wouldn't you?  Oh, you spatula lover.  We're going to all be walking around with that C-scar around our temple to get the N-word out of our brains.  Bloody baboons, you cut out his brain.  You damn dirty spatulas.  So these are some of the suggestions.  Oh, wait a minute.  Does that take care?  Yes.  Number six.  Let me check that off.  Jesus Christ.  I thought we were supposed to do the Anthony Impressions.  That could be misinterpreted. 
[00:14:00]  Number six on the list, more Anthony Impressions.  So Jimmy and I are in a panic.  We're like, uh.  How do you do them?  So I'm a Nazi and I'm paranoid of my neighbors.  That's good.  Right?  And I can't load Vista because I'm a dummy.  Hey.  Okay.  I'm trying to do Anthony Impressions.  Jimmy, your turn.  It says more Anthony Impressions.  It says six, more Anthony Impressions.  Now, I would be led to believe that that would be he wants me to do more impressions.  But no.  It says more Anthony Impressions. 
[00:14:30]  So it means Jimmy and Opie and whoever else else wants to.  You have to do more impressions of me.  All right.  Here's one.  Jews.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  I don't think I've ever said that.  Anyway, go ahead.  Yeah.  Uh, number one is probably my favorite.  Oh, yeah.  And I guess that's why it's number one.  Can I set this up by saying that, uh, I've been doing radio since I was 18.  Mm-hmm.  Okay. 
[00:15:00]  And now that I'm in my early 30s, you know, it's been a long time.  I've forgotten that bit until I hear Jimmy chuckle at you.  What?  You've almost got me sold.  What happened?  All right.  Go ahead.  Read number one.  And listen to the laughter out there in radio.  Now, this is, this, this is serious.  I know it is.  This isn't a joke.  I know it is.  This is a real list that was put together on how to improve this show.  At the reading number one, I finally realized we're in deep trouble.  Yep. 
[00:15:30]  We are in deep trouble.  Let me.  The micromanaging of the Opie and Anthony show.  Let me fill you in on this, too.  We are not a micromanaged program.  No.  We never have been.  We've taken management that tries to micromanage us and just blown them off as useless.  Right.  So don't even try this, this stuff on us.  Don't base our show and what we need to do on other people's shows either.  That, that really annoys the crap out of me. 
[00:16:00]  All right.  Get to number one.  Get to number one.  Try broadcasting the show from a more intimate setting.  Example, a smaller studio.  Opie appears to be on a stage in the current environment.  Ant and Jim may feel left out.  Now, there's, they want us to do this show from that little box studio down the hallway to give it a more intimate setting.  Uh, because Opie, uh, appears to be on stage. 
[00:16:30]  Let me, let me fill you in on the first days of the Opie and Anthony show from BAB.  Yeah?  Opie has always been behind the board.  He works the board.  He's always been on what you want to refer to as a stage.  I refer to it as the guy that works the board and the show.  Uh, I was always at some kind of peripheral mic.  Are you calling me a board up?  That's what I, uh, said.  I want to put that down as a note in, in A.  Hey, E-Rock, could you dim their lights, please? 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, please.  Just dim their lights and keep me on stage.  And put the spotlights really, really bright on Opie and I want to be in complete darkness.  That's it.  Now we're talking.  Opie's all lit up and me and Jimmy are in pitch blackness.  You guys are in the shadows where you belong.  Oh my God.  God, I've been waiting for this day.  It is always been.  I know this is radio, but there's one light left in the studio and it's shining bright  on me. 
[00:17:30]  Jimmy, are you over there?  I feel left out.  It's always been Opie runs the show and I have been on a peripheral microphone adding  in what I do, doing what I do.  And slowly it built up into the role that I have on the program.  When we went to AAF in Boston.  Ed, you talking?  Where?  I'm over here.  Where?  Let me have a light so I can like flash it at you so you know where I am at least.  Get Anthony a flashlight.  But not too bright because I don't want my face lit up. 
[00:18:00]  How is the thought we take you off stage?  Are you going to do a show tune?  This is just proving.  See, this is me on a stage.  The other way.  That's you on a stage.  When the studio's lit up normally and we're in like a triangle formation.  Oh, there you are.  There you go.  I've lit a lighter in front of me.  He has a bird.  Yeah.  Cannot change.  I have a lighter.  All right.  Jimmy's got a flashlight.  Hey, hi, Jimmy.  I have a flashlight.  Hi.  Jim, tell ghost stories.  Put it up to your chin.  I'm scared.  Oh, sorry. 
[00:18:30]  You don't have one.  I know.  I've got to put it up to my chin.  It's just my forehead.  Like that pyramid in Vegas.  That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.  And I've heard a bunch of doozies in my career.  In my career.  Do you think we want to move to that small studio down the hall?  For what reason?  Give me the reason.  More intimate setting?  How about we're allowed to do some things we want to do that needs a big studio?  Yeah.  How about you let us do that?  That seems to be a more viable way of entertaining the listener than putting us in a smaller place. 
[00:19:00]  By the way, think about it.  What?  Smaller studio, more gooder?  Uh-huh.  Smaller, smaller studio, more, more gooder.  Ooh, where's the closet?  Where's the littler studio?  Maybe just production.  No, right there.  Right behind us.  You want to do it from a closet?  Well, that little water closet.  Right.  We'll call it a water closet.  So the smaller the room, the better the show will be.  Is that what he was getting at?  I guess.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute. 
[00:19:30]  Just hit number three real quick before we get to it.  Just let me hit number three.  All right.  Patty Porter!  Excuse me while I whip this out.  He was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time. 
[00:20:00]  Well, number three, more sound effects in bits.  Just effects.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Whoa!  Look out, truckers out there.  We're going to have a report about the icing conditions on some of the big highways out there.  And now, number two on the list of ways to improve the program.  Uh, no. 
[00:20:30]  No.  Number two is going to have to wait until after the break.  But see, I'm not supposed to tell people that because then that would be...  That's number two.  That would be number five.  Don't tease.  But that's also number two.  What?  Is it?  You're also breaking number two.  You're breaking two of the cardinal commandments.  My God!  Thou shalt not announce breaks!  These stone tablets were brought down the mountain by a buffoon. 
[00:21:00]  Well, um...  Carved out of a tweed suit.  So...  And a tie made out of old women's curtains.  Number two says, don't announce breaks.  Sag immediately to break after a funny punchline.  Don't warn the listener you're about to go to commercials.  Sounds familiar.  Uh...  It's supposed to be like after a big laugh or something, you just kind of go to commercial.  Yeah, you just go right to a break after a funny commercial. 
[00:21:30]  Like if someone...  It's called the Costanza.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh.  Like, um...  If I do like a...  Hey, um...  Two Jews walk into a bar.  They own it.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A Uncut and live.  Continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio.  Starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:22:00]  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony!  Hey, we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah.  The O&A virus spreading across America.  We're taking one of John Minnelli's suggestions to heart.  And we are now broadcasting from a very, very small room.  Very small studio.  Because number one on his list... 
[00:22:30]  Of course, he gave us a list of things...  Ways to Improve the Program.  And number one...  Try broadcasting the show from a more intimate setting.  Example, a smaller studio.  I think they meant the small studio down the hallway.  Which is just a cracker box.  But we're thinking, that's a small studio.  And if that's going to make the show better...  Why not even go smaller to make it just an excellent program?  Even more better.  The smaller the studio, apparently... 
[00:23:00]  When I get from...  The smaller the studio, the better the show will be.  So we took his advice and really made it our own.  We're now here in the bathroom.  Yes, we are.  It is a small, little bathroom.  You can wash your hands.  Wash your hands.  Because let's just do bathroom stuff.  Look, I don't want to get...  You know, it's flu season.  And I don't want to get the flu virus.  That's good.  Wash up.  Use plenty of soap, Opie.  I was sick last week.  And I want to make sure that I'm going to be all right this week. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  Feel much better.  I'm just going to...  You know what I'm going to do?  I'm going to change the...  Jimmy!  I'm going to empty the garbage.  Here's the tin towels.  Thank you.  This is good.  Tin towels.  I'm noticing one thing there.  Oh, you dimmed the lights.  That's good, Jim.  Why is Jimmy dimming the lights?  Jimmy!  I noticed there's something...  There's not much to do in a small setting like this.  Like sometimes in a bigger studio with a lot of people and stuff, there seems to be more 
[00:24:00]  to do.  But in here, we're just kind of...  Yeah, but see, the deal is if we're in a small setting like this, we can focus on the show  and not be distracted about being on a stage.  It's more intimate.  Under the hot lights.  See, you...  I just saw a camera.  Why does the mirror have to be so big in here?  Anyway, so this is one of the many suggestions that John Minnelli gave us to make the show 
[00:24:30]  better, right?  Yeah.  You know something, though?  You're not on a stage.  I'll give you that.  No, I'm not.  This is pretty much...  We are all on equal footing.  And that cures three, too.  Why?  More sound effects.  More sound effects.  What's under here?  I don't know what's in here.  Oh, let's clean the toilet.  Cleaning supplies?  Yeah, like you're going to clean them. 
[00:25:00]  Go ahead.  Well, we need to do a bit.  Open the toilet, Jim.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  More bits.  Little Ajax.  Ooh.  Shaking it.  Oh, wacky horn.  Because this is so zany.  We're in the bathroom, and I'm...  Look, I'm cleaning the toilet, and I'm a millionaire.  What?  Are you insane?  I'm crazy, Opie.  Beat that horn.  Oh.  This is insanity.  Sound effects of smaller studio, and Anthony doing an impression of an old Mexican woman. 
[00:25:30]  There we go.  You must be insane today.  You hate germs.  But hold that mic, Jimmy.  All right.  Now I'm going to wash my hair, because I'm a germaphobe.  It's a germaphobe.  Hold on.  I got to, like...  Oh.  You got to...  Ow.  That's hot.  Are you allowed to say flush the toilet, or are they going to dump out of that as well?  Say water closet.  Water closet?  All right.  Very good.  Oh, this is good.  This right now is just... 
[00:26:00]  I can see the ratings just flying through the roof.  Let me dry it with some paper towels.  Someone put the S word and span back under the...  Yes, we don't want to say that.  It's derogatory.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Anyway.  Thank you.  So what are some of the other suggestions?  We're taking the first one.  Well, Opie, we're in a...  Well, it's small in here.  We're in a real small studio.  Just trying to help out. 
[00:26:30]  Being a little wackier.  Well, I certainly don't feel like I'm on a stage, thank God.  Yeah.  Might as well turn the lights off so no one's on a stage.  Oh.  We could play...  Romantic.  We could play a little game.  Just feel around.  Feel around.  See what men touch.  Anyway, what are some of the other suggestions that were given to us?  Well, I think we ran through number two.  Number two is don't announce breaks.  You say you immediately need to break after a funny punchline. 
[00:27:00]  See, that's from a Seinfeld episode, I believe, where George wanted to leave the room on a high note.  Right.  So you go, thank you, I'm done!  And you kind of just walk out of the room.  But this is also done on other programs.  I've never liked it myself.  No.  Where you don't know a break is coming, someone says something, everyone kind of laughs, and then it goes...  Right, right, right.  Well, we like...  The Opie and Anthony show.  We like if there's a big laugh happening on the show. 
[00:27:30]  We like to enjoy that laugh for a while.  It's a little different than other shows.  Other people have to punch out right away when they get their laugh.  What's that?  Oh, a seat.  Oh, no.  Look, see, already things are changing.  Thank you.  Opie just got a stool, and it says, a stage for Opie.  Now, you're the only one sitting, and that kind of makes you...  Oh, I'll sit on the toilet.  Let me sit on the bowl.  Jimmy deserves to sit on the toilet.  Sit on the garbage pail, Jimmy.  Wow, we're getting right back into our ways. 
[00:28:00]  Opie's got a real seat, I'm on a toilet, and Jimmy's sitting in the garbage.  So don't announce break.  Say immediately to break after a funny punchline.  Don't warn the listener you're about to go to commercials.  Surprise them!  Should be a big surprise.  What are they doing?  Close our studio door.  Snapping pictures.  Didn't there an on-the-air light outside this bathroom?  More sound effects in bits.  They want that.  They want more sound effects.  They want...  So I say every three minutes. 
[00:28:30]  Just out of nowhere?  Just a little wacky horn.  The first 30 minutes of the show should be a rundown of what's to come.  What's the primary focus of that day's show?  What is it going to be?  And announce it within the first 30 minutes.  Isn't that a contradiction of don't do a laundry list of what you're going to do for the first 30 minutes?  Because then if people enjoy what you've said or don't enjoy it, they'll just leave.  Well, number five, don't tease.  Teasing segments is dangerous because it gives people a chance to punch out. 
[00:29:00]  Perish the thought.  You keep people listening a little longer.  Perish the thought.  You say you're going to do My Baby is Black sometime this morning.  Yeah, that's going to make people punch out.  Don't tease.  You've got to tease the right things is what it comes down to.  And then, of course, more Anthony impressions.  Ah, which means you and Jimmy have to do impressions of me because it doesn't say more impressions by Anthony or Anthony does more impressions.  It says more Anthony impressions.  So apparently you guys aren't holding up your end by doing impressions of me. 
[00:29:30]  I'll do an impression of you.  Oh, oh, my back.  Oh, oh, I was picking up my wallet.  Oh, that's so hacky.  Wait a minute.  Stop it.  Wait a minute.  And we all know that could also be an Opie impression.  Just give me a break.  Hey, how about that Super Bowl, huh?  Well, let me tell you.  I'm sorry, Chicago.  I told you.  Anthony told you about my sports curse.  Yeah.  Opie picked Chicago. 
[00:30:00]  Yep.  And we all said it was the sports curse.  It was in full play.  And they lost.  You know, I don't have my believers out there.  I have a weird sports curse.  It happens every time.  I haven't picked a Super Bowl winner.  I couldn't even tell you the last time.  No.  I couldn't even tell you the last time I picked a winner.  And you're a complete jinx for the city that you live in.  Right.  Like, you don't even have to pick it.  If you're living there, you were in Buffalo during those...  All four years.  Yeah, all four years.  Yeah.  And then I followed the Patriots when they lost back in the day. 
[00:30:30]  And then the Giants when they lost back in the day.  Oscars.  Oscars.  Oscars.  Ha-ha.  Wa-wa-wa-wa.  Wa-wa-wa-wa.  Sound effects.  Sound effects.  Oh, man.  Who's touched this?  Oh, wash your hands again.  At least it's convenient.  You can just wash...  This is great.  This is an OCD studio.  We just wash our hands constantly.  I like it.  You might have to get off that seat.  I'm going to have to wash my... 
[00:31:00]  Can we switch seats?  You want to sit on the bowl?  Well...  Yeah, I'll sit on the stage.  Wow, that's cool.  I got Opie's stage.  Nice.  And people...  Oh, God.  You better listen in, people, because you never know when we're going to a break.  Either.  Something could just happen, and bam, we're gone.  Right.  We're gone.  What's wrong, Jimmy?  What's up, Jim?  I'm uncomfortable. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, this is really uncomfortable.  Opie, he's sitting on the toilet bowl now.  When I was sitting there, I had the lids, both of them, completely down, so I was just  sitting on the top.  Right.  Opie decided to open up the top one, pull his pants down, and actually sit down on the toilet.  I'm multitasking.  You're multitasking.  He's a method actor.  No, there's no method acting going on here.  This room is much...  Oh, studio, excuse me. 
[00:32:00]  It's our new studio, Anthony.  This studio is much too small for you to pull those shenanigans.  Yeah.  If you want to do that kind of business, I suggest you go into the big studio and do  it in your old chair on the stage.  Let's see.  So everyone's talking about the Super Bowl today.  Yeah.  And we talked about my sports curse, which is really, really true.  It happens every time.  We're doing a sports break now.  We're going to be taking phone calls from Chicago.  How are we going to get the phone calls?  We're going to take calls in here.  Cell phones.  Here, open that door for a second.  Is anybody calling the show? 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  Yeah?  We don't have headphones, though, so I don't know how we're going to hear them.  Yeah.  I'll just tell you what they're saying.  What are they saying, Dan?  Dan is back where I usually sit on the stage.  Wow.  Let's see.  Somebody wants to talk about Tyra.  Tyra?  Okay.  Somebody thinks you shouldn't change a thing about the show.  Okay.  That must be Eric Logan from XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:33:00]  There seems to be a conflict.  One of the companies we work for love us, and the other company doesn't know what the  hell is the problem.  Yeah.  And somebody thinks that going to the break hot sucks.  Of course it sucks.  Of course it does.  By the way, we will not be taking any of these suggestions in the end.  Thank you, Dan.  I've got to close the studio door again.  Sorry.  It's on the air lights on.  Come on.  Shut that door.  Yeah.  Now my mic cord's stuck in the door. 
[00:33:30]  I guess what we should tell the people, we got our Tyra sign on live TV over the weekend.  No filter, Paul?  No filter, Paul.  I got him in.  I'm starting to love no filter, Paul.  Well, he is a go-getter.  That guy will do anything.  Yeah.  And he's motivated.  On the news, I got footage of it, and the guy's doing a live read, a live thing, and  it's behind him in glass.  It's great.  A live shot.  Two big signs that say, Tyra Banks is a fat pig.  Tyra's a big fat pig.  Yeah.  And the other one, Tyra's a big fat pig.  Well, we just thought she was so self-important, like, you know, going over that bad photo that 
[00:34:00]  was taken of her while she was on vacation.  And she spent her whole show last week discussing the photo and how she's not fat, but if she  was that fat, she'd be okay with it.  And we decided that, you know, the world needs to know that Tyra is indeed a fat pig.  So I know Bill DePaul got it on, boy, did he get it on Channel 2 or Channel 4?  One of the big networks.  Channel 7?  Yeah.  I'm talking about the big networks here in New York City?  Anything?  What was it on? 
[00:34:30]  I think it was like a Staten Island weather station.  It was some awful, awful station.  But the video is up on opiananthony.com, whackbag.com, break.com, YouTube.  Just type in Tyra is a big fat pig, and you'll see it for yourself.  And I'm hearing rumors that there's a sign outside her studio in California.  One of the pests out west got a sign outside the studio she does her show from.  The POWs.  Well, I had to offer $500 if anybody could get a sign and prove to me that she sees a 
[00:35:00]  sign saying Tyra is a fat pig.  Yeah, she's got to see it.  She has to see it, yeah.  Because we want the disappointment on her face.  And speaking of video, hold on a minute.  Can you open the door?  How much time do we have left in this break?  Approximately five minutes.  Five more minutes.  All right, close the door.  Don't mention the B word.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because now people are going to expect it in five minutes.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  Don't strain.  You'll hurt yourself.  That's how Elvis went. 
[00:35:30]  Speaking of videos, our own Anthony Cumia is an internet video star today.  Who knew, you know?  When I threw that video up.  A lot of controversy, and it's spreading all over the internet.  This is one of those things.  You want to get really fast again?  Yeah, it's one of those things that really hit a nerve.  I was having trouble loading up Vista, installing Vista on my computer.  Yeah, wash up.  Could you give me the Lysol?  Yeah, you got it.  Thank you.  Hold on.  There we go. 
[00:36:00]  Everything is very close and located.  Oh, you want to?  Here, wait a minute.  I think we got another.  Can you open that door?  Sure.  Hey, plebs, I need more Lysol.  Anyone need a Dixie cup?  I just threw that.  Checked on the cabinet.  Anyway, the Vista.  Stupid Vista.  I tried installing it on my computer.  Brand new computer also.  Very high end.  Very high end.  Wait, brand new Lysol.  There we go.  Thank you.  And it wouldn't install.  So after hours of trying to install it, and I'm no idiot. 
[00:36:30]  I know how computers work.  A lot of people were accusing me of being a Mac fan boy, and I know nothing about Windows.  They just were pounding me about it.  And believe me, I've constantly solved every problem I've ever had on my PC for over 10 years.  I know my way around computers.  This was so effed up, I couldn't fix it at all.  I could not install Vista without having to eliminate so many programs. 
[00:37:00]  And it wouldn't even – there was a conflict with the actual basic bios of my system, which is the main motherboard brains of my system.  So that was the problem.  So I took my copy of Vista on video, ran it through a shredder, and did a little speech about the whole thing.  You weren't around for that?  Oh, I did a little speech about it.  He was in Houston for the improv.  I did a little speech about how I couldn't install it and how it'll install really good on this machine, and put it up online. 
[00:37:30]  And it's just kind of – it's getting a lot of hits and a lot of comments.  Windows people can't stand it.  Mac people love it, and that battle is always going on.  So it's got legs, my friend.  Really?  And it was an honest, like, moment.  It wasn't some kind of – I didn't go, hey, I'm going to be wacky and do this.  I was so pissed that I just wanted to document the fact that I was taking this piece of garbage software – right now it's a piece of garbage. 
[00:38:00]  You're handing us notes.  It might get better in the future when it's installed in machines that come right off of the line.  It'll be better.  But right now it stinks to upgrade to a Vista, and that's my personal opinion.  I love the people in the comments section calling you just an absolute dummy.  Yeah, this dummy, if he knew how to worry – and probably – he's probably got this piece of crap computer that's old and stuff.  No, it's brand new.  And I got NVIDIA video cards. 
[00:38:30]  I got the quads in there, jackasses.  And it doesn't – it conflicts with those.  So don't tell me.  The faithful listeners know that you're pretty much a computer geek, and you really know your way around a computer.  I know my way around it.  I've never had a problem with my computer that I've not fixed myself.  Sometimes it's taken hours, believe me, hours, but I've always been able to fix my own computers.  And you're ready for this?  So Anthony's an internet video star.  Opie and Anthony.com, Ant's video has been viewed 8,000 times. 
[00:39:00]  All right.  YouTube, the video's been viewed 20,000 times.  And you just put it up two days ago.  Yeah.  Break.com.  That's break.com, B-R-E-A-K.com.  It's on the front page.  Anthony's a little internet video star today.  It's up to 627,000 views.  Wow.  Jesus.  It's like the Zapruder film.  I like it.  Oh, it's great.  And you've got to read the comments because people are very passionate about what system you ask. 
[00:39:30]  About what system you ask.  Right, right.  And I rule.  And then also it's turning up on a lot of tech blogs are putting it up there and commenting on it.  A lot of people that are doing reviews on Vista are putting it up there as kind of example of what people are going through trying to load this new operating system up.  It's a pain in the ass.  So if you haven't checked out the video yet, go to break.com.  Break.com has Anthony's video of him trying to load Vista. 
[00:40:00]  Hey, what.com?  A break.  Dot com.  It's the Opian Anthony Show.  The Opian Anthony Virus.  We're back with the Opian Anthony Show.  The ONA Virus spreading across America.  Everyone's talking about the Super Bowl today.  Sorry, Chicago. 
[00:40:30]  Opi jinxed you.  Yeah, the sports curse worked again.  Again.  It really is astounding how that works.  You pick a team, they lose.  It's just the way it happens.  I've got to tell you.  Besides two plays, what a boring game.  And people are going, what?  What a boring game.  I know it sucks. 
[00:41:00]  These guys spend their whole lives dreaming about going to the Super Bowl, working their  asses off all year to be in the Super Bowl.  It's finally there.  It's finally here, I should say.  And it's a rainbow.  Just pouring rain the entire time.  The whole game.  No one can hold on to the ball.  So you're not going to see a lot of deep passing.  They've got to adjust their game.  They're dropping the ball.  They can't even get it from the center half the time. 
[00:41:30]  What a boring game.  Do they have that stat?  How many times it's rained for the entire length of the Super Bowl?  I can't remember another game.  When the last time?  I don't either.  I know there have been occasions when it has rained.  But never.  And usually isn't it in a domed or something?  Don't they do that?  No, it's usually in domes or a very warm climate.  Yeah.  Miami just.  Ah, there it is.  It is indeed the first Super Bowl played entirely in the rain.  And Miami just got effed. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, I guarantee today it's going to be nice and sunny.  High of 75 degrees.  Life is just weird.  Life is weird.  You got women out there.  They dream their entire lives about maybe getting married on the beach.  And then that day finally arrives and they either got the flu or they got their friend or a monsoon hits the beach that day.  Life has a way of just kicking you in the nuts. 
[00:42:30]  It's also, I guess, the first Super Bowl with, of course, two black coaches.  And the first Super Bowl to be lost by a black coach.  Is that a?  Yeah, yeah.  Yep.  Just wanted to add that.  Well, they like keeping track of first.  So you're right, Anthony.  This was the first time a black coach lost a Super Bowl.  So they got that one out of the way as well.  Enough with keeping track. 
[00:43:00]  No one gives a crap.  Colts won the first Super Bowl since 1970.  You know what I'll care?  I think we brought it up on Friday, Anthony.  First black guy walking around on the moon.  I'll be like, that's an accomplishment.  Wow.  Back to the moon.  Black astronaut.  There he is walking on the moon.  Also in conjunction with the first trial on the moon.  First illegal frisking on the moon. 
[00:43:30]  And, yeah, this kind of brought up another discussion in the office this morning.  We actually do discuss things during what is supposed to be the show prep portion of it.  We don't just paw through a couple of newspapers, sit there and sneeze at each other.  Well, they've kind of looked at us one day preparing for the show.  And based that on our fire.  And their comment was, very scary how they prepare for the show. 
[00:44:00]  This is how we've been preparing for the show ever since we got together 12 some odd years ago.  Because we don't do it like a Z100 or your morning zoo does it where there's 18,000 people running around like maniacs.  Writing the hackiest crap you could get your hands on.  Writing scripts and getting top ten left together.  Writing scripts for a bit.  So whatever his name is, the mailman.  Or whatever his name is, the milkman.  Or whatever his name is, the weatherman.  Can come in and do a wacky bit.  Don't forget about stunt boy. 
[00:44:30]  Stunt boy is doing stuff.  How about the fact that we show prep 24 hours a day.  It's called life.  And then we drag our sorrows and miseries and occasional happiness into this place and spill it out.  How about that's what people have been listening to since we started the show.  It's infuriating.  Wednesday.  We're meeting Wednesday.  And you asked for it.  They wanted this meeting.  Oh, why doesn't Anthony meet?  Why doesn't he ever want to meet?  You want a meeting?  You got it. 
[00:45:00]  And believe me, I'd love to do it before Wednesday.  But I'm busy.  What are you busy doing?  Anything else but meeting with them.  This should be your only priority.  Believe me.  I ain't got other things to do.  It's called show prep.  I'm show prepping Monday and Tuesday.  I can't fit it in.  You know, we're having fun with this, but I'm not going to lie to you.  Some of the suggestions, downright scary.  Annoying.  Downright scary.  And insulting.  We've been doing radio a very long time.  And I'll say it again.  It's working just great as far as XM goes. 
[00:45:30]  We're not making major changes with this radio show.  This is what it is.  And by the time we get here to do our show, we get in about an hour before we crack the mics.  That hour is getting our heads together, going through the papers, making sure nothing crazy happened overnight, discussing some of the things we've seen since the last show, making sure we have the audio clips and this and that.  And then we come in here well prepared.  But from the second we get off the air, we're already thinking about and gathering stuff for the next day's show. 
[00:46:00]  Right.  So follow us around a whole day then.  We're actually not.  Very scary.  But anyway, the black coach winning the Super Bowl.  Yeah, black coach winning the Super Bowl.  And they made a big deal out of this whole thing.  It's been one of the biggest issues they've talked about is that there was two black coaches in the Super Bowl.  And they're kind of just freaking out about this whole thing.  And it got me thinking.  Call me crazy.  I just saw two football coaches.  Two coaches.  I really did.  Just two football coaches.  But they really wanted to point it out that, oh, my God, this is the first time in history. 
[00:46:30]  So are we to be led to believe that we can go from that and then to the next presidential election and we'll have a black president?  Like everyone's going, what do you think Obama's chances are of being elected president?  People are stunned and amazed and quoting stats and have to point out the fact that we have two black coaches in the Super Bowl.  So let's go from that to president of the United States of America. 
[00:47:00]  Do you think America's ready?  Do you really think we could go from that?  I think maybe a couple of things in between.  Yeah, I think maybe a few steps in between coaches for the Super Bowl and the president of the United States might help a transition.  There will be a black astronaut walking around on the moon before we get a black president.  And, well, there should be, I think.  Why?  I don't give a crap about the color thing. 
[00:47:30]  Maybe.  I think it would kind of be cool, a little black perspective, see how the black community reacts to a black guy walking on the moon.  That would be kind of funny to listen to.  We know what side he'd land on.  Let's wake him up with a little pink Floyd this morning in the lunar module.  Two black coaches and it first of all, it rained through the whole thing.  Any coincidence?  I think not.  God was crying. 
[00:48:00]  God's a football fan.  Don't get any ideas.  The bright side is ours.  The bright side is ours.  Look.  Yeah, we're going to land you over there.  Look, we've got to start somewhere, just like we did in America.  Maybe eventually, but.  Do you think they'd leave him as the command module guy?  You guys can lay claim to the dark side.  I don't think so.  Leave him as the command module guy that has to orbit around and wait for him?  It's like, ah, I'm leaving.  He always falls asleep in the getaway car. 
[00:48:30]  Anyway, well, you make a good point with that, Anthony.  Sure.  Sure.  Some observations.  We've got to stop thanking God.  Yeah.  God doesn't care about sporting events.  When you look at the past week's events in the world, I don't think you should thank God for winning the Super Bowl.  No.  I think he should have had his hands full.  Perhaps you should thank God because maybe he was paying a little too much attention on the Super Bowl that a one-ton explosive went off in Iraq and killed hundreds, injured hundreds. 
[00:49:00]  Well, maybe that's a good way to look at it.  Maybe he had a Super Bowl party and he was getting ready for the Super Bowl party.  I think God was hosting a Super Bowl party.  A little distracted.  Passing out the chips, getting mad at Mrs. God, punching her in the eye for standing in front of the TV.  That's right.  She ran out of Pabst too early. 
[00:49:30]  Pabst.  God's a blue-collar drinker.  He certainly is.  You know when you start thanking God, when you look out your window anywhere in America and you hear this.  What do you do?  Oh, God.  Yes.  Thank him for making things we can laugh at, like people with Tourette's.  Wow.  Where did that come from?  Oops.  Take two.  At least it's a sound effect.  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't say they have to be relevant sound effects.  Okay.  Let me read the quote here.  Yeah, what was the quote again? 
[00:50:00]  It just says, has to be more sound effects.  More sound effects.  Just more sound effects.  So.  So.  There you go.  Covered for the hour.  So what I want to say is.  Yeah.  You know when we should start thanking God?  When you can look out the window anywhere in America at any time and you hear this.  What a dull day on the world.  Anywhere in Iraq, you look out the window. 
[00:50:30]  Anywhere in Africa.  Well, in God talk, I believe that's called Armageddon or Rapture or whatever it is when they clear  out everybody.  Except for the crickets.  All right.  Good point.  Just clean them out.  Wait.  Hold on.  There could be a little something going on.  Let's give you one of these.  A cricket and then play a little cricket.  All right. 
[00:51:00]  That's just a little flurry of gunfire somewhere.  Bob in Arizona.  Bob.  What's happening, fellas?  Good morning.  Good morning.  And I'm calling you from Phoenix, home of Super Bowl XLII.  It's never too early to do your plans or whatever.  In fact, you know what?  I'm going to invite you fellas and Jimmy.  Everybody come on out.  Crash my.  Boring.  Thank you all in cool places.  Listen.  This whole thing with the thanking God, I totally agree with you, Opie.  Because if, you know, you thank God that one team, what is the coach going to do? 
[00:51:30]  He's going to be pissed at God because they lost?  You know, I'm not really a big fan of that.  And the whole thing with the African-American coach, if I'm not mistaken, about 25 years ago, a fellow by the name of Tom Flores.  I hope he wasn't mistaken.  If I'm not mistaken, please be mistaken. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, exactly.  If you're mistaken is interesting, you're not mistaken.  Well, tedious.  We picked out two very interesting clips as they're thanking God yesterday after the Super Bowl.  You've got the Colts owner here giving his speech, talking about the storm and thanking God.  Of course, the storm was the tornadoes that hit Florida.  Just awful.  Oh.  I don't know how many people died, but a lot of people died and lost everything.  Yeah.  So he acknowledges that.  It was one of those big, uh, twister-like, uh, tornadoes.  Yeah, he acknowledges that because, you know, they're in Florida doing the Super Bowl here. 
[00:52:30]  And that has the worst segue ever.  Finger of five.  Thank you so much, Commissioner.  I want to start off by saying, um, that our thoughts and prayers are with the people in Central Florida after those tornadoes.  And, uh, the Colts, uh, will participate, uh, in, in helping, uh, in partnershiping, uh, with that tragedy down there.  And in our prayers are with them tonight.  We don't want to forget that.  Now we're world champions. 
[00:53:00]  Jesus.  Wow.  Nice segue.  Sorry that you lost everything and you lost loved ones, but we're world champions.  Yeah.  God.  That is, uh, a little awkward segue.  I guess there's no easy way to do that, but man, he, like, wow.  That was what they call it.  He turned on a dime.  A danzition.  A danzition.  That was a danzition.  Right.  Thoughts and prayers go out to everybody. 
[00:53:30]  Uh, you know, the, uh, tornadoes down there in Florida, just horrible.  Uh, a lot of people, uh, death, destruction.  So, uh, thoughts and prayers out to everybody like that, huh?  Hey, how about the Colts?  Yeah.  Big winners.  By the way.  Yeah.  I'm trying.  Well, I'm trying.  Another, uh, Anthony impression.  I'm just doing, uh, impressions.  Well, we need more Anthony impressions, so there you go.  All right.  Well, what a horrendous segue.  That couldn't have been worse if he said it's standing on the rubble of a trailer. 
[00:54:00]  No kidding, man.  And then he thanks God.  It's like, are you kidding me?  So God was responsible for that.  Thank you, God, for ignoring the tornadoes and maybe making the tornadoes touch down in  an area where no one was living.  Yeah.  Are you turning that up?  Is it?  No, it's, it's not doing anything.  It's still, it's still just one.  I guess the headphones are broken.  Oh, really? 
[00:54:30]  Box.  I'm only getting one side of my headphones and I'm not getting the other side, which is  okay.  Just plug it back into there.  I'm a professional.  I'll rise above it.  Ooh.  All right.  That's what they say anyway.  That's all right.  All right.  He's plugging it back in.  All right.  So, uh, yeah, here's the Colts owner again.  So, uh, the, the drastic segue, and then he gets to thank God.  You ready over there?  This isn't too distracting.  No, I know.  Sorry.  Um, that wasn't adjusting my volume. 
[00:55:00]  It was just fucking loud.  It was just fucking loud.  Holy shit.  I don't care.  You're going to dump me eight times.  I got it.  How about making things work in the studio?  Nothing personal.  I swear.  It's not you.  It's just when, when we get crap and it's written down in, in, in, in, in memos.  And then nothing works when we come in and there's no street team and there's no stickers 
[00:55:30]  that are supposed to be out on the street.  And it's New York city.  And we're supposed to have a t-shirts and stickers and sweatshirts in the winter and hand them  out at events because it's only New York.  Nothing ever goes on in New York where there's a collection of people to maybe drive to and  hand out stuff that I have to do with the show.  So, uh, we, I've had it Wednesday, Wednesday, looking forward to it, looking forward to  it.  It better be a private place because I don't want to make a scene in front of people. 
[00:56:00]  You know what I was thinking too?  Holy crap.  Am I going to yell?  Yell.  You know what I was thinking too?  Like they're not doing anything to support the show whatsoever.  They just expect us to do radio magic, uh, day in and day out.  And you know what?  We will do that.  We, we know we are, we're a confident radio show and we'll be just fine in the end.  But I was thinking as I was watching the Superbowl yesterday, how many times did they go local  to, to, uh, to, uh, promote their stupid local news team?  The news team.  How about you throw us one lousy 15 second nugget and give us the 15 second Opie and 
[00:56:30]  Anthony commercial while all of New York's watching the Superbowl.  We work for the same company and they're like, what can you think of that?  And I'm so sick of getting the emails and the phone calls.  Well, what could we do to help you?  Why don't you do the obvious?  Yeah.  There are the simple things that, you know, had worked.  Why don't you do the obvious?  We have an Opie and Anthony TV commercial.  You got like a 95% share of TVs watching the stupid effing game. 
[00:57:00]  Enough about the local CBS news team.  You couldn't use 15 seconds of that to promote the show.  What can we do to help?  What can we do?  Pump their dopey fade and dopey news guys up, uh, uh, during the Superbowl.  They just pumped to the hell out of them.  You know what you could do?  Start thinking out of the box.  That's why we do like satellite radio.  They think out of the box.  The old way of doing radio isn't working as well. 
[00:57:30]  So you got to start thinking differently.  And if you got this high profile Opie and Anthony show that, that is in a million markets, especially in New York, where it's really important to get the ratings up.  Why wouldn't you throw us a bone and give us 15 lousy seconds during the freaking Superbowl telecast?  We're not talking about the commercials that were going for what?  $2.6 million per 30 seconds.  We're talking about the promo spots over and over and over again for the local news.  You had time to, to, to, to, to give us. 
[00:58:00]  So don't ask us, what could we do?  Cause you don't even know how to do it.  You don't even know how to do the basics.  Concentrate on your end.  It was one lousy phone call from one guy to another guy.  Can you help us out?  This would be a nice little boost for the show.  Considering we got all of New York, uh, watching the Superbowl on our channel.  Wasn't another network doing the Superbowl.  It was the same company we worked for.  And whether they could or could not do that, that's an idea.  That's an idea right there. 
[00:58:30]  Dopes.  That would have been good in Chicago too.  Bunch of dopes.  Yeah.  Might've helped.  Huh?  That would have been good in Chicago too.  Yeah.  I'm not even asking.  I'm just asking locally in New York cause what happened?  See the Superbowl.  They got these commercials and everyone talks about the stupid commercials, which by the  way sucked.  And we're not, and we're not going to do what every other radio show is doing today and spend  40 minutes talking about how cute the commercials were.  In general, they sucked.  Okay.  They were awful.  They weren't creative. 
[00:59:00]  They blew.  Guess what the best commercial was?  K-Fed.  K-Fed.  It's not even listed in the USA today.  That was the best spot.  Hands down.  K-Fed's the new hero.  Hands down.  Why didn't they list it?  I don't know.  It's in the category of the rest.  They have the 10 most popular, then they have the least popular, and then they have  the rest.  And Budweiser, you know, as far as the top 10 commercials are all over the place.  They got just about every spot.  So amazing.  Stray Dogs and the Clydesdales. 
[00:59:30]  Cliche.  Had a rock in his hand and hit him in the forehead.  And he got the Bud because, you know, rock beats paper.  What did the Clydesdales do?  Was it like a horse gag?  It was like a horse gag video.  It was a scrappy dog that didn't have the spots.  But then a truck goes by and sprays muddy water all over the dogs.  And now he has spots.  And now he could be like, you know, part of the Budweiser team.  That's crazy.  Much better way to...  America stinks! 
[01:00:00]  I thought that was cute.  What if the Clydesdales was doing horse gag with someone who was drinking a Miller Lite?  That would be a great commercial for Bud.  Immigrants learned to ask for Bud Lite.  Carlos did a good job there.  But it wasn't anything spectacular.  And it just goes on.  The apes trying to, like, figure out how to get the beer from the beer guy as they're in their zoo atmosphere.  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly. 
[01:00:30]  I don't even know where we were.  But I'm so sick of what can we do.  Well, guess what?  Start thinking out of the box.  That's what you can do.  Steve just had to come in and show us the list.  It was just like...  He goes, you want to hear the list from my meeting?  I'm like, yeah, please.  And he read number one and I was just annoyed.  So the point I'm making is...  These commercials, obviously, that's revenue.  Very important.  That's like $2.4 to $2.6 million per 30 seconds. 
[01:01:00]  I get that.  Don't want to touch that part of the game.  I get it.  But see, because CBS had the Super Bowl, they had local promos.  Join us after the game to hear the same thing you hear every night.  Well, they promoted their local news team here in New York.  Yeah.  And it just shows you the power of advertising.  I don't even know their names.  Nope.  And I watched the entire Super Bowl.  But if you get a quick 15-second Opie and Anthony spot, wow, that would really help the show.  And guess what?  You're not taking money away from the company. 
[01:01:30]  No.  You're just using airtime to promote your stuff.  But they're going to suggest us doing a show in a smaller studio and that's going to get, like, ratings up?  Are you insane?  You've got to be insane.  Yes.  I say yes.  Insane.  Coming up...  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  What?  Teasing.  I think I ripped it to shreds.  Is there another one?  Another copy?  I get Anthony another copy.  Here's my copy. 
[01:02:00]  There it is.  It's pristine.  And you're breaking rule five.  Don't tease.  Teasing segments is dangerous because it gives people a chance to punch out.  Call the Opie and Anthony show right now.  866-313-3.  O&A, who's this?  It's Opie and Anthony.  What do you got for the show?  Nothing.  So why'd you call?  The Lummy. 
[01:02:30]  If you have a point that's relevant to the topic at hand, call the Opie and Anthony show.  866-313-313-313-313-313-313-313-313-313-3141.  Here we go.  Here we go.  coming up on the opium anthony show no well no no no no no well what happened stop teasing 
[01:03:00]  oh i did it again can't tease so i can't tease the fact that eroc is getting a brazilian uh  wax job today we'll explain a little later can't tease that that would be stupid to  something like that right teasing no teasing that'd be really dumb right against the rules  also anthony has uh put up a bounty yes i got a bounty looking for a naked woman 
[01:03:30]  i i got a hundred bucks just as you don't even here's here's the catch just to show the company  and the fcc that nothing's gonna happen if there's a naked woman in the studio in the year 2007  there is a catch to this ladies you don't have to do anything that's that's the catch you don't have  to do anything we don't even have to put you on mic you come in you remove all your clothes  and then you put your clothes back on and you leave that's it that'll earn you a hundred dollars 
[01:04:00]  that's a prize that's that's all there is to it i don't want to hear from her i don't want to  like nothing just just do it there you go how dangerous oh my god the place is bursting  of flames holy jesus how will we recover we're gonna lose the license what are you you're gonna  lose the license you're like some kind of a crazy person do you know what that'll do 
[01:04:30]  so we talked about uh the super bowl commercials and someone on the line goes hey what about the  snickers commercial what was it two guys sharing a snickers i mean i hope they pulled it out of a  toilet bowl and shared it and they might realize it wasn't a snickers and they might have kissed by  accident so then they have to like do something really manly in front of each other to show that  they're men stop it stupid that corny like white guy be a guy hey how about the game 
[01:05:00]  and um speaking of nudity so hopefully a girl will uh show up naked it's all we want believe me  and then we could you won't have to do anything then we could show these dopes around here that  nothing's gonna happen the radio world's not gonna stop because uh there's god forbid some nudity on a  radio show yeah we've done it before oh my god anyway oh baby steps speaking of nudity aunt and i 
[01:05:30]  saw the same movie over the weekend just a coincidence because we don't go to the movies  together matter of fact we don't do anything together but we still do a fine radio show hey  because we it's logistics my friend we love doing a radio show together yes what was the movie uh  i went and saw the 11 30 a.m oh i don't know it was just one of those cold that was the what was  the showing i saw what 11 30 a.m yeah but you saw it from your bed yes i did see i gotta start being 
[01:06:00]  nice to people i realized over the weekend because then i can get some nice perks people are sick  on the irks pay i am the stupidest man alive because you know there are people that uh want to love me  yeah and want to give me things and i just i just crush their dreams and smash things in front of  their face which is fun and stuff but then i go home very lonely which is fun and stuff it's all  fun crushing people's dreams and spirits but then i go home lonely and then i i have to uh listen to 
[01:06:30]  anthony talk about all this great stuff he gets from the listeners i don't like bootleg movies i don't  like material things i like the conveniences that they can offer it's a wonderful thing we give  entertainment to them they give us certain conveniences so this is what happens because i  smash things in front of people uh saturday at 11 30 in the morning i have to leave my apartment  it's like 10 degrees outside to go see babble babble babble babble academy award nominated 
[01:07:00]  babble starring who's in that uh brad brad pitt it's an ensemble whatever and uh anthony because  he's nice to the listeners and actually uh treats them like human beings he also saw babble  at about the same time i did yeah uh my theater was showing it at 11 35 but did he have to bundle  up for the cold weather here in new york city no i have to put on a bunch of layers and some gloves 
[01:07:30]  and a hat and a scarf and i was at a great theater that offered um the uh chance to uh pause the movie  when i had to uh use the restroom yeah and i could um get stuff to eat uh that wasn't at the concession  stand and they also offered uh sexual favors  it's a wonderful uh uh theater yeah it's called my house your bedroom that's right note to self that's  where i want to see movies gotta be nicer that's where i want to see movies i'm writing it down 
[01:08:00]  i'm crazy be nicer write that down nicer to listeners i think it's funny that you said i  like to crush people's dreams and that's fun and all but like like the message you got was  completely wrong like like it's it's not wrong to crush their dreams it's like i know i crushed  their dreams but as a result i don't get any free swag no see i will i here's this is the logic in  this head i still will crush people's dreams but there's gotta be a way to do it so i still get free 
[01:08:30]  stuff well that's something you're gonna have to work out that's quite the problem so uh we went  and saw babble the movie's too long it's oscar nominations like crazy and i gotta tell you man  it's an all right movie it's it's it was they i when it was over i just went yeah that was a movie  brad pitt's acting stinks he's terrible when is hollywood gonna realize that uh he was just a  pretty face and and he's older now so that doesn't even help his career he is one of the worst actors 
[01:09:00]  in hollywood he's staying they were saying that his performance in this is his best performance  ever delivered in any movie he's ever done don't leave you can't leave if you leave i will kill you  i will kill you if you leave don't leave wow i that was just uh wait a minute wait i swear to you  i thought roland got brad pitt for us and it was a surprise and i was going to turn around and he  was there when you just delivered those lines it sounded just like you thank you and i'm not even 
[01:09:30]  more impersonation not even explain why he said that because who cares it was just that he said it like  that if you leave i will kill you you can't leave don't you leave don't you leave me here  he's awful i've hated him wasn't he in that movie like california where he played like a serial  killer or something like that i i think he's just terrible he's stunk his whole career stunk he's  been in some great movies too he was he was good enough i club i'll give him that i didn't see that  you got a line from that um no let's fight no tyler durden i want to do the unexpected so i say no 
[01:10:00]  give me one more from babble um  try to think what else he said oh just give me that one help help somebody help he does these  impersonations i swear you would think it was the real people i'm gonna tease a joke here's a little  joke about the movie babble why would i want to go see that when i could just talk to my girlfriend 
[01:10:30]  about her day oh i got a i got a line from fight club i got a i got a line from fight club yeah  first rule of fight club don't tease bitch going into break he does these impersonations i swear  you would think it was the real people but anyway so uh babble babble uh it's uh kind of three stories  yeah kind of intertwined by some common denominator um one taking place in morocco 
[01:11:00]  with brad pitt another one taking place in southern california and uh mexico with some um  big fat mexican woman and brad pitt's kids kind of shows that no matter where you live we're all kind  of in this human experience together it's one of those pieces and another one taking place in japan  i saw it more as it was a somebody making a bad decision and how it affected so many people with 
[01:11:30]  its little ripple its little ripple on humanity yeah but it was a bad decision was made by somebody  and it it was a cause and effect kind of movie and for some reason they had to intertwine the  stories a little bit to give it that yeah we're all on one planet kind of a thing no matter how far  apart we are what about the times you make uh because they pretty much thirded the world  right they put the world in thirds yeah and and even during even though the world is huge they  were kind of tied in somehow what about the what about the times you do something and it makes uh 
[01:12:00]  a very very good thing and it's a good thing it's a good thing or sometimes a bad thing makes a good  thing happen yeah exactly that wasn't what battle was about exactly not the battle i'll i'll tell you uh  uh a situation where a bad thing turned out to be a really good thing for me personally oh  yeah maybe not for you out there that hate me but uh oh my uh my dad yes married his high school  sweetheart uh-huh and she died too many very early at 26 years old holy maybe 27 and that's the only 
[01:12:30]  reason i'm on this planet hey hey the cults how about everyone god bless that's why i thought babbles  sucked wow because there are horrific things that happen that that turn into good things for certain  people like myself and and the uh how many more five uh brothers and sisters that came after me 
[01:13:00]  none of us would be here if my dad didn't go through a horrific tragedy wow wouldn't it be weird  though if we could reverse time and see what would have happened and if she never died he would  have had four kids like one president and one who cured cancer yeah instead you're making it sound  like this is so great yeah instead it worked out that one dr pepper addict and a lunatic  filthy things on the radio my brother yeah enough with the soda you idiot it's rot in your stomach  pepper but uh see my brother drink soda all day i i thought i thought it was i thought it was one of 
[01:13:30]  these art pieces it was one of these things the academy loves but uh i found it to be a little  long uh one good thing though it was one of me and over here on the phone last night discussing the  movie a little movie recap see this is what john and the rest of the gang over here don't see  and i show prepping when we're not here on the phone keeping in touch with each other and 
[01:14:00]  yapping about what we want to talk about on monday and we both decided that we needed to talk about  the japanese uh deaf school girl school girl nymph yeah babble the only reason to see babble yeah  the second half of the movie she's pretty much naked the whole time yeah walking around showing  everything when she decides to uh go that route she uh really kind of gives it her all but she's deaf  she can't at all you know just sign language and stuff and um i guess she's very self-conscious of 
[01:14:30]  this and she's got deaf friends and all but uh uh some girl told her you know she's she's angry all  the time or sad all the time because she has never had sex and it's really seems she took that to heart  and she wanted to be happy she wanted to be happy so badly but she had so much you know bad things  happen in her life i won't get into that people want to see the movie uh that she kind of went off  and just figured maybe if i have some sex with a guy i'll be happy this is what i learned if you're 
[01:15:00]  deaf you become promiscuous very very promiscuous promiscuous or promiscuous and and you get very um  uh bold with your moves yeah well you know how they wear uh in japan uh and they love putting this in their  japanime pornography and stuff uh the little school girl outfit the little plaid skirt  and stuff they wear that in japan and she's wearing it and she's got the skirt pulled up really high 
[01:15:30]  and she decides to give uh these guys at some little like a place that they meet place that  kids would meet after school kind of a place um give them a show so she removes her um undergarment  from under the skirt and she's sitting in a booth at the edge of the booth that's and the guys start  looking over and she slowly just turns toward them and they show everything in the movie that's  sexy it was it was kind of like whoa we started leaving the house on a daily basis yeah like a 
[01:16:00]  on a daily basis the dentist scene was great and then that didn't work so then she had to get her  teeth cleaned there's death getting her teeth cleaned this horny deaf mute so the the dentist  no undergarments in a catholic schoolgirl skirt this isn't ruining storyline at all and believe me  you'll just be excited to see the movie if i describe it like this the dentist is working on her teeth  and he's getting real close to her mouth and she slowly lifts her head and licks the dentist's mouth 
[01:16:30]  yeah licks the dentist's mouth and he kind of like backs away and goes back to work and she licks his  mouth again and he asks what are you doing and she grabs his rubber gloved hand and just smacks it right  down just smacks that grabs his hand and just places his hand on a place and then squeezes his hand  she thought that she that they might try to clean this for radio oh i think they know yes i'm filling 
[01:17:00]  up i i am filling up if you watch this it's really like hot in this twisted way and then and then she's  got to uh apparently her husband her husband her father is somehow involved in what happened in  morocco uh with brad pitt through some kind of a weapons trade thing that happened and the police want  to talk to him and this girl has a hots for this young cop that came over so she invites him over 
[01:17:30]  and uh he's kind of talking to her she leaves the room and walks slowly back into the room  completely naked with her little japanese body oh and at that point in uh the movie i went  because popcorn's stuck i'm not i'm not i need some water i am almost full from that dentist scene  description the dentist scene was like really cool the stupid stick-in-the-mud dentist and then  then she was like naked for like 10 15 straight minutes she just was naked detective very uncomfortable 
[01:18:00]  at the end too when she was still naked on a balcony yeah but uh it was uh daddy came home  to make everything right make everything all better but her being like naked the dentist thing was  because she's just laying in there and she's got the little skirt on and obviously she had removed  anything else so when uh she grabbed the dentist's hand and did that she kind of let out like this  she was very very um uh excited about the whole situation right very pleased with everything and 
[01:18:30]  kind of her facial expression and a little sound that she made let the audience know how happy she  was about this and the dentist was so horrified uh that he just made a leave he goes get out of here  get out of here so she kept just getting this rejection over and over again and uh that's like her  part of her misery but it all stems from something that i won't get into my um it's funny i had my i 
[01:19:00]  went to the dentist recently yeah i knew that was an option apparently it is don't take the sexiness  out of it that was yeah that was whenever they kept coming back to the japanese part of the movie i  was like okay perk up all right i'll watch now i could give a crap how bad a shape brad pitt's wife is in  who gives a crap about the dirty mexicans the mexicans get back to the kids the horny deaf mute will  you drunk mexicans lopping off chicken heads right right right right you can't leave don't leave 
[01:19:30]  i will kill you if you leave he does these impersonations i swear you would think it was  the real people by the way if we're being fair here um eric well let eric in queen state i agree  with this eric go ahead yeah how you guys doing today hey it's unbelievable if you're going to talk  about if you're going to talk about great brad pitt movies you got to talk about snatch where you  can't understand a word that's coming out of his mouth snatch is one of the most underrated movies  ever made that's a good movie that movie has a cult following but never got the respect it  deserved yep it is a great movie but the point is that it's great brad pitt films where he all his 
[01:20:00]  you know basically the entire bet you anything in the script it just said mumble but yeah but no  one made him a great uh actor in that movie it was yeah like you said he mumbled through the whole  movie exactly yeah they have the option on the dvd where you could have just subtitles when brad uh  pitt talks because that made him a great yeah because you can't understand anything he says so  you could have that on when uh when you're watching the movie to see exactly what he's saying yeah brad  we need you to mumble but snatch is a great movie eric you're right thank you i got we got to move on 
[01:20:30]  oh man that's why i want to move on and they hung up though some guy's saying that uh he used to live  next to a a deaf mute and and she was a hoa i uh oh the mic was off i used to listen uh to i used  to have a deaf uh family that lived next door to me and um they had a daughter and apparently she went  to uh the same high school i did and apparently she was a goer too so is there some validity to  this whole thing yeah there's something going on if you're a deaf uh girl maybe you just deaf girls 
[01:21:00]  call in now and we'll talk to you about if you're deaf you have no confidence so you have to give it up  that's what i think you you could be right well you've just never heard the word whore  you don't know what you don't know what it means right you're not self-conscious because no one's  calling you don't do that or you're a slut what i can't hear you  yeah that was a pretty uh yeah pretty good part of the movie uh 12 monkeys brad pitt what do you think 
[01:21:30]  uh a little too over the top i know he was playing a nut but it was a little too over the top  nutty uh i love that movie though i'll watch that anytime it's on yeah love the 12 monkeys hey bob  it's in the tooth bob in the tooth that's a really good movie too maybe it's uh his later  movies then yeah i think he started off okay and then uh i don't know california it's good in that  with a k but you don't like that hate them in that i hate them in 12 monkeys i hated them in seven 
[01:22:00]  i thought i was doing watching this scene with him and morgan freeman and kevin spacey  and i'm like you just don't belong morgan acted circles around brad pitt and seven  yeah he sure did morgan freeman kind of plays the same guy in every movie though yes but this was  before he's playing that soft-spoken kind of country kind of black guy that just thinks everything  in seven he was you didn't know that he was going to do the same i know it was new then it was new  then for the most part doesn't matter what part he's playing though it's just that kind of well 
[01:22:30]  like shawshank is a prime example of one of his performances spacey's great i think kevin spacey's  a good actor he was getting glory morgan freeman yeah slaps denzel washington in the face  yeah it was hot i think kenny's on cold medicine look at him over there oh are you  yeah i got a cold from the plane nothing helps out a radio show than looking to club sort of kenny  and watching him uh almost fall asleep with heavy eyelids you know who he looks like he looks like

[01:25:30]  just that we don't like his parents arm and peach  talking about ona uncut and live continuing the show on xm satellite radio starting at 9 a.m  eastern visit xm radio.com to subscribe it's the opian anthony show  get ready for another meltdown get ready for another meltdown what now sweetie you're listening 
[01:26:00]  to the opian anthony show and i know what happened about uh two hours ago but think about what you  said about two hours ago naked girl we want a naked girl in the studio just to come in not even be on  mic not even be on mic uh just come in remove all of her clothing everything down to not a stitch 
[01:26:30]  and then take her clothes and put them back on and i will hand her 100 that's it that's all i want  to do just to show that we can have a naked girl in this studio without any problem she won't talk  we won't talk about her won't describe her body won't do anything just take the clothes off put them  back on and leave with a hundred dollars this just did a communique from tom chiasano tom and i quote 
[01:27:00]  no nudity rule is company policy his job is to enforce it  you three two one why why do you understand that that is a part of being a guy and a part of what  what uh uh this type of radio is is doing that and and and through these i'm trying to like uh work 
[01:27:30]  this out diplomatically through uh what would they call baby steps by just bringing a girl in  and then having her leave without anything happening just to kind of show that it's possible  why can't company policy be challenged why can't it be talked about and discussed and maybe changed  or or rain back a little bit why is it zero tolerance nothing worse in this country than 
[01:28:00]  zero tolerance why and i go back to a phone call that i received you know talking about this and that  about the radio show and this person got very mad at me personally because he told us to go talk to  the lawyers and we didn't set up the meeting with the lawyers fast enough and my thinking stupid me  and and of course uh speaking for anthony as well i'm thinking why would we talk to the lawyers knowing  nothing will be accomplished that is not going to solve the issues we have with doing radio on a 
[01:28:30]  commercial platform so this person got really mad he goes i'll set up the meeting for you guys and  he set up the meeting for us and nothing got accomplished except uh except i guess we're allowed  to use the word faggot every once in a while now this is this is the the the tree falling in the  forest thing and if no one's there to hear it does it make a sound if a nude woman is in the studio  and no one acknowledges it did it go out over the radio the answer is no it didn't if all of a sudden 
[01:29:00]  i just go oh i owe somebody a hundred dollars that's all the listeners hear right what what is  let me just go like this i'm gonna turn around right now all right and go oh okay wow look at  that now that's really don't say a word oh i'm sorry don't say anything okay and i reach in my pocket

[01:39:00]  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  We'll be right back. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry.  Kid song.  You're listening to The Future of Radio. 
[01:40:00]  I just want to be happy. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, I'm sorry.  That song was really great.  This is the O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[01:41:00]  The O.B. and Anthony Fire.  The O.B. and Anthony Fire. 
[01:41:30]  The O.B. and Anthony Fire. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah, I see where you're going here, Anthony.  Yes, yes.  I said I would give $100 to – I don't even remember kind of how I put it, but it was to a girl that came down, took all her clothes off, every stitch.  Didn't have to say anything or do anything.  This is a first pretty much because we didn't demand anything of her except that. 
[01:42:30]  Put the clothes back on and leave because there's some kind of rule in place that says that we cannot have naked women in our studio.  It's company policy.  It's company policy.  It's company policy.  It's company policy.  Company policy.  So I'm like, what is it going to hurt?  So I figure we'll take the most innocent thing because it's the radio.  It's not television.  So if she doesn't say anything and I just hand her the $100 and we look at her, we don't even comment on it, what she looks like or anything when she's naked and just leaves after she's done, puts her clothes on and leaves. 
[01:43:00]  How is that hurting anything?  How is that jeopardizing the license or an FCC fine or a violation or something?  But for some reason, they have a problem with it.  But I already said it.  So now girls have shown up.  Some we sent away, but Kenny has told me there is something that maybe is worth another $100.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, you've been waiting outside. 
[01:43:30]  Well, I'm not waiting outside anymore.  You better turn around.  All right.  Don't say anything, anybody.  If you blow this, I'll personally dump out and then punch somebody.  All right.  Just don't say anything.  Can I just say nice?  You could not say anything because I know you.  Nice.  Just would you leave it alone?  All right.  And just pardon me. 
[01:44:00]  Some things take a little time.  You better get up.  And it's getting up.  Because it's radio, I've got to explain.  You're reaching into your pocket.  It is taking its toll.  All right.  I don't want to know your name.  I don't want to know where you came from.  Just that, too.  Right there.  Yes.  Just adhering to the rules that I put forth, Ford.  It's a little detail, but it has to be everything. 
[01:44:30]  No, you can't say that, Kenny.  Is Anthony talking to himself?  You decide.  That's good.  All right.  Now, put yourself back the way you were when you came into the studio.  And thank you.  Kenny, give her this and take her out into the green room when she's ready.  And now, back to the program.  Here you go.  What did that do?  Huh?  Did that just blow up the station? 
[01:45:00]  Did that just revoke the license?  There's nothing wrong with that.  Guys, tell me what we could do to help you guys out.  Let us do that.  Guys, we want to help you.  What could we do to make the show better?  And slowly, perhaps.  Why haven't you talked to the lawyers yet?  Oh, I don't know.  They could give their name.  Or they could say hi or something.  Just some.  Slowly, I'm hoping this can turn into something that will show the people in charge that this 
[01:45:30]  isn't going to blow up the station.  The answers are right in front of your face.  Yeah.  They really are.  Right there.  Time to start thinking out of the box.  You dopes.  What's considered nude, technically?  I mean, if somebody keeps a hat on.  Nude?  Yeah.  Well, I don't even want to say it.  Well, according to the newsstands, as long as you have a little. 
[01:46:00]  Pasty.  Not even a little, just a little minute dot.  A dot.  I call it a dot, not a pasty.  I can't even explain.  Like a hole puncher dot.  I don't even want that.  And then the woman is clothed, officially, according to the newsstands.  Let's hypothetically say, did you see something a few minutes ago?  That is what I consider nude.  Could have been talking about something on the internet or anything that I pointed to. 
[01:46:30]  Not anything live or anything.  I noticed something.  Not a plastic explosive or anything.  Dr. Zorda.  I noticed something.  Yeah.  What?  It's very cold in the studio today.  Yeah.  For how cold it is outside, maybe there should be a little more heat.  Okay.  So, Kenny, please turn up the heat.  Notice that.  Is Kenny actually walking to a thermostat?  Of course he is.  He'll decide.  He's kind of like the heat miser.  He doesn't need to.  Just rub his hands together.  All right.  It's one degree hotter in here. 
[01:47:00]  His hair bursts into flames.  I'm going to reach his combustion point.  Guys, we really want to help you.  What could we do?  Oh, great opportunity yesterday during the Super Bowl.  I said it earlier.  Oh, yes.  Promoted the local news show here in New York.  What about one lousy 15-second promo spot for the Opie and Anthony show?  That would have been huge.  What happened, Jimmy?  You are really an Opie.  I'm sorry.  By the way, you're in my worst nightmare right now. 
[01:47:30]  Why?  Oh, my God.  This is one of the worst possible things that could happen.  I was in the bathroom, and they have the wax set up for stupid.  For stupid.  It's a warm thing.  And we've all touched candle wax before.  Yep.  So I'm sorry.  I don't know your name.  Nicole.  Nicole.  I said Nicole.  Candle wax is fun because when you're a kid and you have a candle burning, a big candle,  and you dip the tip of your finger into the little pool of wax and let it dry,  and you'd peel off like your fingerprint, or you'd peel it off your hands. 
[01:48:00]  And it would be gone once you peeled it off.  Well, this is honey wax.  So I touched it with my pinky.  It's a little warm, and I let it, and then I'm like rubbing it off on my finger.  It's stuck to like five of my fingers.  I didn't realize that this wax is different.  It's not in any of the crookers.  Oh, God.  But I asked her just to, I wanted to feel it.  I've never been waxed.  So I said put a little bit on my arm, but I didn't know they did it with a stick.  Can I see the wax?  They do it like a tongue depressor or something?  Yeah, but it doesn't hurt.  No, it doesn't hurt, but it's sticky to the point where I hate sticky. 
[01:48:30]  Sticky drive me crazy.  No.  It's not that bad because you know it's wax.  And if it gets in like the crook of your elbow where you bend it and then feel it's sticky in there  or any of the joints of your fingers or the worst was behind the knee,  some idiot at some party, birthday party as a kid would always spill Coca-Cola on a chair.  Oh, God, that's freaking me out.  I hope he's just grabbing it.  It's all over his hand. 
[01:49:00]  Oh, it's all sticky.  Oh, by the way.  Roll your fist up, so you get it sticky like that because I got it in here too.  No, this is what I do.  Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap on the board.  Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap on the board.  Tap, tap, tap, tap on the board with my waxy fingers.  It's not going to work.  Listen.  Oh.  How sticky is that? 
[01:49:30]  It's bad, dude.  I've never felt it.  Oh, God, it's like gum.  It's like chewing gum is on the tips of your fingers.  And now is it in the joints?  La, la, la, push all the buttons on the board.  La, la, la, push all the buttons on the board.  You're not going to ingratiate yourself with the staff here by pressing the board buttons with your sticky fingers.  Oh, God, is that a mess.  Look at my ear.  That's going to be there for us.  Yeah, that's good.  Give him a dry paper towel.  He gives him a dry paper towel. 
[01:50:00]  It's like he's been tar and feathered, you dolt.  It's not going to make a difference if it's wet or if it's dry.  All right, listen.  We've got to get Iraq waxed.  Someone explain.  Oh, my God.  I believe there was a UFC bet.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Iraq's gay and his life partner has been complaining.  Yeah.  What does this do?  Iraq lost.  There you go.  And the...  I'm really getting creeped out.  Now the paper towel is stuck to his hand in a way that you can tell his whole hand is just a sticky mess. 
[01:50:30]  Hey, I want to get my eyebrows waxed off.  No, don't do that, do you?  Oh, no, it takes six weeks to go back.  No, I don't.  Yeah, yeah.  We've got an HBO show to prepare for.  Hey, so hurry up.  We've got to explain this because we're leaving soon.  Maybe for good.  Iraq lost the bet.  Right, right, right.  So the loser has to get a Brazilian bikini wax.  Now, you know what this entails.  Brazilian girls wear very revealing bikinis. 
[01:51:00]  They're thong-type bikinis.  So the front and back has to be devoid of hair or else it'll look all messy.  So they wax it.  So Iraq is going to get that exact same waxing, both front and back, to remove any unruly hair.  And what, there was a bet?  Yeah, some kind of a bet.  I'm part of the show and I don't even know what the bet was.  It was on the UFC, Iraq bet that Silva would lose. 
[01:51:30]  Right.  To who I'm spacing on right now.  Travis Luter.  Travis Luter.  The winner.  Yes.  And Silva won.  Ah.  So Iraq gets waxed.  So did Cro Cop, by the way.  Bye.  I must crush you.  All right.  Okay.  Now, what does this briefly entail?  Pain.  A little pain.  A little bit.  Nice.  And you just spread some of this honey wax on with a stick.  Going against, with the hair grain. 
[01:52:00]  With the hair grain.  Because I've seen this done on TV.  And then what do you use?  Do you use some kind of a papery thing?  Yeah.  It's like a little bit stronger than a paper towel.  And it just grabs the hair.  It grabs the hair.  And they push it and kind of rub it so it really sticks.  And then you pull it in the opposite direction of the grain.  I will be kept.  Wash your hand.  You're freaking me out.  I can't take sticky.  Kenny, pull up my sleeve, will you?  Pull it up, Kenny, quickly.  By the way, I have no hands-free at this point. 
[01:52:30]  Dude, is that sticky?  Everything is so sticky.  It's awful.  I can't get this thing.  Where do you have to take it?  Can you pull this thing off my hand?  Pull it off.  When I was in construction, sometimes I'd touch a 2x4 that sap was coming out of.  Yeah.  And there's no getting that off you.  Nope.  You've got to spray like WD-40 on you to get it off that way.  But it would get in the crooks of your joints.  And just, I'd lose my mind.  Lose my mind.  Speaking of sap, Eric?  Yes.  No, that was good. 
[01:53:00]  All right, Eric.  Sap.  So, Eric, you lost the bed.  You ready for this?  Yeah.  All right.  So, do what you've got to do.  All right.  Here we go.  He's in the bathroom that we started the show from.  All right.  Where are we starting?  Kind of the front of the thong area?  Where do you want to start first?  I'm here.  Just pull your pants down, stupid.  Get started.  Yeah, he's got to start.  Take your shirt and cover.  Okay.  We don't cover.  Jesus, we've seen vaginas before.  Quick, go to break. 
[01:53:30]  And Nicole.  I can't believe you've got to give me a rock $100 today, Ed.  Oh, no.  He doesn't count.  He hasn't lost any weight in his chest.  That certainly does.  That does not count.  Look at Shy.  What?  Stop being Shy, you sissy.  Sam is with his camera.  Of course he is.  It's now an erotic video.  A moronic video.  Yeah.  Now, I guess, where would you wax?  Steve's turning his head in disgust because it's not his type of guy. 
[01:54:00]  Steve's a size queen.  Oh, wait.  You're not unclipped.  Where would you do it?  Are you talking like the crease of where the leg meets body area?  Okay.  That's got to be done.  And then up above a little bit, I would guess, has to be.  Brazilian is a bit gone.  Wherever you would remember.  Brazilian is everything that is covered by that type of bathing attire.  Yep.  All right.  Let's go. 
[01:54:30]  Holy Jesus.  Let's go.  Let's get it going.  All right.  Yep.  Let her rip.  Is this Tony's daughter?  Yeah.  Tony from...  Yeah.  Revolta's.  Revolta's.  Fantastic place, by the way.  In Tom's River, right?  Yes.  This is his daughter?  What's up?  Headphones?  Who needs them?  Oh, she wears gloves.  She's putting on black gloves.  You need them?  She's putting on black gloves so it doesn't stick to her hands.  Derek wants headphones and eye protection.  By the way, Tony makes nice daughters.  Yeah.  She's lovely.  Yeah.  How long have you been doing this? 
[01:55:00]  Ten years.  Is there a risk when you pull hair off that somebody can bleed?  Yes.  All right.  That's awesome.  Is there anything you can do to make that happen more often?  It's not going to rip your skin off.  It's just when you're pulling the hair out, it's...  Right.  You know, it's in there.  You're pulling it out by the root.  All right.  Yep.  Hey, by the way, everyone's talking about the Super Bowl today, so how about that?  Yeah, some game.  It was amazing.  Fantastic.  Sorry about that, Chicago.  Yeah, I was rooting for Chicago.  Yeah.  Sports curses.  All right, we're relaxed.  Wait, what's going on? 
[01:55:30]  Kind of talk us through this.  What's the procedure?  Oh, he's not bad.  He's not bad.  Harry is bending over a pedestal that we've positioned in a bathroom with a little...  And she's saying he's not that bad.  They're in a bathroom.  He's not really messy?  No.  Not very hairy.  I have a lot of hair on your chest.  What's that?  Do you have a lot of hair on your chest?  Yeah.  You do?  Yeah.  What a man.  Chest would hurt more.  Shut up.  All right, should we give him chest?  We might have to just give a swipe on the chest.  Let's...  No, no, swipe on.  Go Brazilian first.  Yeah.  One Brazilian swipe. 
[01:56:00]  Quickly.  One Brazilian...  No, one Brazilian swipe and then we go to the chest.  Wait, did you already put it on there?  How...  All right, wait.  No, not yet.  Look at me.  How much do you have here?  Uh, some.  There's...  Some.  Did you shave before yours?  That way it wouldn't hurt as much?  I just haven't grown much.  All right.  You can't describe it, you silly gooses.  All right, how about this?  Put it on before you pull it off.  Just put it on.  Then before you pull it off, tell us what it's on.  Yeah.  But smear it in like, you know...  Where two halves might meet.  Yeah, really, really...  Hey!  Get a good one. 
[01:56:30]  What's her name?  Nicole.  Nicole!  Yes.  Don't really describe anything.  We know what's going on.  Just make him scream.  That's all we care about.  Is the wax being applied?  It's going right now.  Okay.  How about she leaves it on there?  She leaves it on there and then does his chest and he'll have that sticky side down his pants  all day.  How about...  Hold on, Nicole, before you pull it.  Okay.  Give me one more minute.  Do you want to make him just...  It'll still be sticky.  You think so?  Yeah.  Because once you pull it off, it's going to get my arm. 
[01:57:00]  It's gone.  How about she gives one pull and leaves the rest?  It's hot.  It's hot?  What's wrong, Eric?  No, it's not.  You're telling me.  No, it's not.  I'm putting the strip on.  Okay.  The strip's going on.  And here we go.  Let's listen.  It's not going to hurt.  It's not going to hurt.  Ready?  Oh, that wasn't that bad.  Yeah.  It's not.  All right.  Try again on the other side.  And then make sure she leaves it.  Just have her leave it.  Yes.  But tell her...  Hold on. 
[01:57:30]  Hold on.  Oh, she's got headphones?  Mm-hmm.  Okay, here's the gag.  What are you writing?  Hand her that note.  What are you writing?  Don't let anyone see it.  Nicole, just spread this where I put on the note.  And once it's spread there, tell him to pull his trousers up, and you're going to do the  chest. 
[01:58:00]  It's awful.  Get it off.  Get it off.  Eric, what's going on?  She's applying the wax.  All right, just say that.  Yeah.  Nicole, you know where to put it?  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  All right.  Is it there?  It's there.  Give it a second.  Now, I think you should do the chest.  Yeah, do the chest.  Iraq, do the chest.  Do the chest.  Yeah, so just leave it flat there.  All right, pull your...  Pull your pants up.  Pull your pants up, Iraq. 
[01:58:30]  Pull your pants up.  Pull your pants up.  Oh, crap.  My shirt's stuck to my ass.  Ow.  Ow.  It's going to hurt me, too.  Just pull your pants up, dummy.  I've got to walk around like that all day.  Oh, it's going to be...  Oh, it's horrible.  Did you put it where I said to put it, Nicole?  Yep.  Okay, good.  Very good.  Wow.  Right there.  All right, that's really...  I've got a little extra for you, too. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, you're beautiful.  Okay.  All right.  Pants up?  Yeah.  Let's do it.  All right, do his chest.  Take your shirt off, Iran.  Oh, it certainly is.  Oh, you're too...  I think you're still allowed to say that to a guy on the radio.  I'm not sure, though.  Yeah.  Take your shirt off.  Wow.  Let me see how hairy his chest is.  Yeah, kind of poke out a little bit over here.  Wow.  What a fantastic definition.  There's nothing hair.  Jesus.  He lost weight, though.  Yeah, he does.  He looks good for a fat girl. 
[01:59:30]  All right.  Try to suck his gut in, because she's pretty.  Yeah, what are you doing, E-Rock?  I'm sucking it in.  Oh, he sat down.  What are you, dumb?  Oh, God.  Why did you sit down?  Oh, my God.  You're better off sitting after a month in prison than you are after what she just did.  Must have squished out like space food.  What's going on, Eric?  Looking at Eric's body.  It's glued together.  All right.  Let's just. 
[02:00:00]  All right.  He's got the hair and consistency of a marshmallow.  Eric, he's now topless.  And his chest and his belly button makes it look like his chest is whistling.  Oh, the open belly button and the stupid nipple eyes.  Big pink areolas he has.  Makes me sick.  There are babies crying right now.  All right.  Nicole is applying the wax.  See, we really need a bill to win this contest.  He's the hairy mess. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah.  E-Rock is unusually smooth.  Un-hairy-like.  Ah!  Fuck!  Oh, hey!  Oh, hey!  Whoa!  Oh, wait a minute!  Oh, he had a curse.  E-Rock!  You know what?  You cursed.  Al, you get that?  To get that, Al.  Listen, this is what happened.  What do you say, Al?  Bleeding.  All right, listen, listen.  He's bleeding.  Listen, Al did the right thing.  He dumped out right at the time that she pulled off the strip. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  E-Rock, you know what that means, right?  Wait for an hour.  What?  We got to get one for the radio.  You cursed.  One for the radio.  One for safety.  One for safety.  Because you cursed and no one heard the reaction, which was brilliant, by the way.  Make it just as good as the first one.  All right.  No sympathy.  E-Rock, you don't curse.  You're good.  She yanked that off and he screamed and cursed.  It's red, too.  His chest is red.  Oh, he'll bleed.  He'll get these little blotches of blood.  All right, E-Rock.  He's ready for a good tea.  Hold on.  Are we ready there? 
[02:01:30]  Yeah.  All right, this is for the radio.  Here we go.  Squish it on good.  All right, squish it on good.  Here we go.  Did I hear a curse?  He cursed again.  I think I heard a curse.  Steve's saying, yeah, Steve, a curse?  He cursed.  Why did you?  Under his breath, I heard a curse.  One more time.  Why would you curse again?  Someone on WCKG saying, yes, he cursed.  How about...  Great. 
[02:02:00]  Nicole, can you get it down by the...  I'm going to get him to curse one more time for you guys.  Down by the pinkish area of his chest.  All right, here we go.  E-Rock.  No cursing, E-Rock.  No cursing, E-Rock.  What's wrong with you?  What do you say, Al?  You don't have to do radio.  Well...  There, no curse.  Woman.  All right, here we go.  Are we ready?  Yeah.  All right.  Self-control, man.  Yeah, no cursing.  Have some pride.  What's wrong with you?  She's rubbing it on.  Here we go. 
[02:02:30]  No!  No!  No!  What?  What?  Did he think something inappropriate?  Wait, what?  Can I get the last strip off?  Get the last strip off.  Get the last strip off.  Okay.  Oh, poor boy.  All right, hold on.  Ah!  Oh, God damn.  Oh, that's got to hurt.  He might be down for the count.  Not really.  And he's all sticky back.  Back by the shed. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah, a lot of people want to know...  Back by the back patio.  A lot of people want to know what bet Nicole lost.  Well, you know, she's got to finish the job, Iraq.  You can't...  You know, you got a lovely girlfriend.  She doesn't want to see you like that.  Might as well even it out.  All right, even it out there, Nicole.  Uh, Rivoli's.  Tom's River.  Great place.  Yeah.  The O&A pests go there all the time.  Go there.  Got a little party coming up soon, in the middle of this month. 
[02:03:30]  There you go.  Gonna go down there, stop off, and then continue the journey down to Atlantic City.  How's the Italian food in that place?  Iraq?  Yeah.  Nicole, are we ready to even it out here?  Ready.  All right, here we go.  Don't curse, or we do another one.  I think that was too close to occur.  Anyone else with me on that?  He's in such pain, he's bubbling out saliva.  Yeah, he's gurgling. 
[02:04:00]  All right, let's do it one more.  Oh, this one's gonna hurt.  It's near the shoulder blade.  That wasn't that bad.  Oh, you're getting cocky.  How about under the arms?  Oh, that wasn't too bad, huh?  Under the arms.  How about the armpit?  You ever done an armpit?  That hurts.  Old piggy pits.  That'll hurt you.  Give him an armpit.  Iraq, you up for an armpit?  Now, Nicole, here's what you do.  You put it under the armpit, and then close his arm, and make him leave it there.  Yeah, but the armpit noise would be unbelievable.  Yeah, do one armpit.  Do one armpit, and then the other one.  Iraq, you up for an armpit? 
[02:04:30]  Sure.  Iraq's a trooper.  All right.  All right, we're going for an armpit.  My hand's stuck to my pants.  Ow.  Ow.  Just do one.  Wait.  You've got to put the goop on both, and then not do it.  Iraq.  Yeah?  I'm making a deal with you.  If you curse...  Yeah.  ...we do the hair on your head.  Jesus.  I'm okay.  He took it like past fun and says, sadistic, we get your parents, and we kill them.  The minute box car.  That's your family.  Remember, Iraq, don't worry.  Be happy.  All right.  Here we go. 
[02:05:00]  Ah.  This is our pitch.  He's applying the wax.  Here we come.  Nicole, why don't you apply the wax to the other one, too?  Yeah.  Are you sure?  100%.  We can be sure.  Put the wax on both.  Keep both arms up, Iraq.  This is going to be quick and painless.  Oh, come on.  Poor Eric.  Hurry up.  We've got to leave the show in a minute here.  This terrific show we did today.  Yes.  Bang up.  How about that prince, huh?  Oh.  Yeah.  He sang the song.  Right.  Anyone else get the impression that he was just winging it up there? 
[02:05:30]  Nah.  Didn't really.  I didn't see it.  I didn't care.  Yeah.  Okay.  Tell us when you're ready.  One second.  Oh, boy.  All right.  She's doing both, right?  Yeah.  I hear it.  It just sounds sticky.  Oh, she's pressing, really?  This is...  Okay.  All right.  Hold on.  Oh, my God.  Wait.  Are you sure?  This is the showstopper.  Oh, Eric's breathing.  Put the mic by Eric's mouth.  He's breathing heavy.  Eric, you curse.  He fell off the toilet. 
[02:06:00]  He closed your other arm.  He's crumpled in the toilet.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  What?  Is it hanging there?  What is...  When he did that?  What?  His other arm shot down when he did that, so now his arm is semi-glued to it. 
[02:06:30]  All right.  Might as well just leave that there.  I guess we're out of time.  Put your shirt back on.  Let's hear it for E-Rock.  Yeah, E-Rock.  The video will be up on YouTube, and if you're going to be checking out videos today, don't  forget Anthony trying to install Vista.  He installed it into his shredder, and the video is taking over the world today.  It's on the front page of Break.com if you haven't checked it out yet.  What?  No.  Oh, he's going to do the other one?  Yes.  Oh, hell yeah.  I just kind of want to leave it there.  Yeah, we...  Leave it there.  I know, but the noise...  Oh, this is going to hurt. 
[02:07:00]  We...  Oh!  Kind of got in the way.  Oh, my God.  He's kicking things.  All right.  With that...  We leave you with this today.  E-Rock, you all right?  Oh, yeah.  He's crying.  He is crying.  He's got tears.  Oh, no.  Oh, E-Rock.  All right.  We'll get a full report tomorrow.  Leave the rest on.  Leave the rest on.  God forbid we tease something for tomorrow's show, but we'll talk to E-Rock tomorrow about  what just happened.  We leave you with this today.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba. 
[02:07:30]  We'll see you guys over at XM.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  Oh, wow.  That sounded horrific.  Anytime sticky.  Oh, this is stupid.  I think the bottle stuck to your hand. 
[02:08:00]  I want to thank Rivoli from Tom's River.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba 
[02:08:30]  Thank you. 
[02:09:00]  Thank you. 
[02:09:30]  Thank you. 
[02:10:00]  Thank you. 
[02:10:30]  Thank you. 
[02:11:00]  Thank you. 
[02:11:30]  Thank you. 
[02:12:00]  We're pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch, cornwalls, three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM.  You know I could have been a model. 
[02:12:30]  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed.  Read.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  The second half of the show begins with me trying to put the headphones on with one hand because 
[02:13:00]  your other hand is still sticky from all the wax from that honey wax.  We just left a mess over there.  We just left a mess over there in more ways than one.  Right about now, they're having a meeting in an office somewhere going, I think they're  going crazy.  I think they're going crazy.  Where's Iraq with his stupid ass cheeks stuck together?  Oh, his ass.  That's got to be one of the most horrible feelings.  His ass cheeks are glued together. 
[02:13:30]  How are you feeling, Iraq?  Sticky.  You know, for the first time.  I took my jacket with your ass hands.  With your ass hands.  For the first time.  He kicked the chair away.  It happened today.  I actually felt sorry for Iraq.  When they took your armpit hair off.  Take a seat.  No, that's all right.  Why?  Now, what happened?  She took a bunch of that honey wax, put it up your ass crack.  Yeah.  From where to where? 
[02:14:00]  From the left cheek all the way down under.  Under taint to your taint.  Yeah, right about there.  So it wiped over your asshole and everything.  Just next to it.  Just next to it.  Okay, on the side.  And then you made you pull your pants up.  So you now have your ass cheeks welded together with this shit?  And the boxers are forming to my ass as we speak.  It's like crazy glue.  Dude, let me tell you something.  I came in here complaining about my hand. 
[02:14:30]  This is leading somewhere.  My hand, because I was messing around with the wax to freak out Anthony because he hates  sticky things.  Yeah.  Like, I can't.  It's just driving you nuts.  My fingers are, like, stuck together.  I know.  It's, like, pulling apart.  It's grabbing and then, like, snapping apart.  Jimmy's got the same thing happening with his hand.  Wait, Ope, open your arm.  Ope opens his hand.  It looks like the type of graphically in the grudge.  Yeah, where they move all choppy.  Like a certain producer used to move.  But anyway, so I'm really bummed out. 
[02:15:00]  I don't know how to get this off my freaking hand, right?  I can't imagine what you're going through with your ass cheeks stuck together.  Oof.  That and my left arm pretty much glued to the side.  Oh, no.  It's stuck and ruined a shirt.  How bad?  Have you ever felt worse pain than the armpit hair being ripped off?  I think the...  Wow, he's got to think about it.  The icy hot thing.  Oh, the icy hot thing?  Yeah.  When you take a shit, it's going to be like a Play-Doh Fun Factory. 
[02:15:30]  It's going to, like, squeeze out in the shape of something around that waxy honey wax.  It's going to have to try to find a way out, so it's going to be just squishing around.  It's going to be squeezing out like his ball bag.  It's going to run underneath like a conduit from his asshole, and it's going to come  shooting out the front of his balls.  His balls will lift up, and shit will come out.  Yeah.  Hey, E-Rock, poor Goof, could you do a couple of jumping jacks?  Oh, come on.  Just watch your tits jiggle, sweetie. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah, nothing to do with the wax.  We just want to see you do some.  Go ahead.  All right, here we go.  This is a first.  Shut up.  Are the hairs kind of pulling a little?  The arm's coming loose, but it's pulling hair, but the bottom is still staying closed,  so it's like stretching skin that won't move.  Your asshole.  It's still stuck together.  What is where your chest was waxed?  Is it bleeding at all?  Did it get all?  Oh, my God. 
[02:16:30]  She didn't do that size.  Oh, it's all red.  She left like half a...  She left one tit hairy.  Did she go home?  She said, you can take care of the rest, right?  I took the stuff and left.  Yeah, she was deeply disturbed, too.  She was a razor.  So, um...  You've got to get that off your hand with something.  I don't know what to do.  I had Kenny get lemon.  Try some lemon, because that lemon...  Lemon will work.  The acidity might.  She said neosporin is what takes all this off.  Neosporin?  That and one of those loofah sponges.  Well, let's get some neosporin.  That's right, and loofah each other. 
[02:17:00]  A bunch of men.  Would you loofah my honey wax?  Well, someone from their phone is saying nail polish remover.  Great.  Oh, that's good.  Acetone.  Exactly.  Try the...  Hydroploric acid.  Damn, you got me.  You're just a little too quick for me.  Um, all right, listen.  Also got to cover something from Friday, a leftover from Friday.  Yeah.  Of course, went out with all the guys Friday.  Went out to lunch.  I was too sick to join you guys.  I know.  I know.  And there was one little orphan, one little person that took it so fucking personally that 
[02:17:30]  he wasn't personally invited.  What I said was, here is exactly what I said.  Paid staff is cordially invited to go out to lunch Friday after work.  You didn't invite anyone personally.  You just made...  No, I made a blanket statement.  I'm not going to sit there and fucking...  What is this?  What is this?  A school party in the third grade?  You're invited.  You're invited. 
[02:18:00]  I said the paid staff is cordially invited to go out and have lunch down at Rue.  And I believe you said it on the air.  Yeah.  You might even be able to pull the tape.  Yeah, it was just, is everybody, you know, that's involved with the show except for,  you know, the interns.  They got to kind of earn, you know, their keep and I'm not fucking buying them lunch.  Atta boy.  Or hanging out with them.  Not even a financial thing as much as it is.  Ugh.  How many...  Just don't want to hang out with them.  How many interns do we have?  I don't even know.  No one took them to lunch?  Maybe one.  Fuck them.  How many do we have?  One or two, maybe. 
[02:18:30]  About six.  All right.  Well, I...  Okay.  All right.  I'll...  Good.  I just curious.  Good for them.  Well.  You are...  You, you motherfucker.  Our own Bill.  Bill?  Bill.  Of all people?  Wasn't there for lunch.  So I don't, I don't fucking say...  I'm not the kind of guy that's going to go,  Where's, where's Bill?  We can't start yet.  Bill's not here. 
[02:19:00]  I just assumed Bill was busy and had something else to do.  I find out later that Bill was upset, insulted, fucking snubbed that I didn't invite him to fucking lunch.  He made a to-do about it to the point that somebody brought it to my attention.  It has nothing to do with you.  It was just that it had something to do with me because you made it seem like I didn't personally invite you.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  So what I did then was we all left in a gaggle here, got into the elevator, went to lunch, and you just stood there because you didn't get a personal invite? 
[02:19:30]  No, I just thought that...  Well, first of all, I thought someone on the staff would just say, hey, we're going to lunch.  I just see everyone leave.  I'm like, oh, where'd everyone go?  Everyone left because I said everyone will go to lunch.  I didn't hear you.  I'm sorry.  That's my...  Oh, my God.  Oh, boy.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  So then I had to, like, now feel guilty because Bill thought I was an asshole.  I wouldn't expect you to.  You don't feel guilty ever. 
[02:20:00]  I know.  I wouldn't expect you to invite me.  No, but I did.  That's just it.  I then got this feeling like you thought I was some kind of an asshole.  No, no, no.  I was snubbing you.  I thought it was...  I would expect just the staff to say, hey, we're going to lunch.  But everyone just left.  Oh, now he's blaming you guys.  Oh, Danny?  Dude, Bill, fuck off.  If we're all going to lunch, just like Ant, I'm not looking around seeing who's in the  group walking over and being, oh, wait, guys, hold up.  Let's not cross the street, yet Bill's not here. 
[02:20:30]  I guarantee that no one even knows...  Fuck you, blaming shit on Ant.  Go fuck yourself.  Oh.  Fuck you, Stan.  No, you're right, because he's a fucking asshole.  And then, you know, I need help.  No, fuck him.  I needed help on Saturday for Patrice O'Neal because, you know, there's two separate studios  and, you know, I can't run back and forth from studio to studio.  Right.  And so I had Bill ask me on Monday, oh, if you need help, I'll help you out.  And I said, all right, that's cool.  So he was mad that I didn't grab him, you know, to go to lunch.  And then I get a text that says, yeah, you know, something came up. 
[02:21:00]  I'm not going to be able to make it on Saturday.  And then he tried playing it off later, that it was just a joke.  Oh.  That was just me being wacky and goofy.  But, you know, you just don't get my humor because I'm a genius.  Oh.  Oh.  Shit.  Oh.  Bill?  Bill?  Bill, comment.  Bill, comment.  Yeah, it was a joke.  Bill rebuttal.  I just wanted to piss you off because I knew, and you freaked out.  Well, congratulations.  It worked.  Oh.  Fan wrote me a little note.  He goes, maybe you guys can eat just the two of you. 
[02:21:30]  Fan, go fuck yourself.  How about you have a candle at the table at the parker?  Get a room ready?  I have nothing against you, Bill.  And, you know, I was then under this impression that you thought I was a dick for not inviting you.  No, no, it's nothing to do.  And I, you know.  I think you were a dick for purposefully doing it when you knew I was going to be away.  I did.  Oh, good move.  So, Jimmy's not around.  Fuck him.  Because I would have eaten a lot.  He eats too much.  I would have heard of food just throwing on the floor. 
[02:22:00]  I like it.  It wasn't even the food.  I enjoy going out with a bunch of guys that like to drink at noon.  It was like the second it hit noon, everyone's like, beer and wine.  But as soon as Danny and Bill are going at it, did you see the rest of these fucking animals just run in and drop their hands together?  I know the jackals and hyenas gather around for some scraps.  I just love it.  Go ahead.  All right.  So Bill didn't help you out, Dan?  No.  Yeah.  Well, he eventually came in.  The text I got from him after that first one says, oh, you know what? 
[02:22:30]  I'll just watch the UFC fight there.  So, yeah, he eventually did come in.  Oh, he showed up?  I was always going to come in.  If I break a promise, I'm going to tell you face to face.  I wouldn't text it.  He wouldn't text it.  Well, why do you have to start shit in the first place, Bill?  I was irrationally mad for like a half hour and then I went home and felt good.  See, he was mad.  You were mad.  But not at you.  You had to be mad at me because I was the guy that invited everybody. 
[02:23:00]  So if you weren't invited or felt you weren't invited, then you were mad at me.  I don't know.  I get irrational sometimes.  Do you?  Yeah.  Well, Bill, you're saying that you were mad when you sent Danny that text.  I would have been mad, too, if I felt snubbed.  But at least if you were pissed off, you were telling him, fuck you, I'm not coming in Saturday.  You're a fucking instigator.  But, I mean, is that accurate, though?  Because I would be mad.  If my feelings get hurt, no man wants to say his feelings are hurt.  It was more along the lines of, I knew Danny would freak out at the moment he saw that and he did.  So why take it out on me? 
[02:23:30]  I shouldn't have.  Yeah, you got issues.  Wow.  Oh, what you missed is.  Because I heard Danny over the phone on Eric, and he was like, fuck him.  Fuck that guy.  I'm like, oh, shit, Danny's real mad.  So that's when I took back.  I'm like, oh, fuck him.  Yeah, fuck you, Bill.  You missed all the fun and shenanigans because E-Rock wound up getting a post-it note put on his back that was there for the millennium.  What is there?  It just said fat with an arrow on it.  It was genius.  Simple, fat. 
[02:24:00]  And the waitress thought every time she walked by, the waitress, like his back was facing the restaurant.  Eric.  It was on his back, and she passed him by.  So when they were leaving, when all of us were leaving, the waitress actually went up to Eric and said, I'm sorry, I noticed it, but I didn't know what to do about it.  Eric still didn't know what was going on.  He still had it on.  He still had it on.  So he's like, kind of looked at her like she was saying some strange cryptic thing and just walked out with fat and an arrow on it.  Please tell me you ordered a sundae. 
[02:24:30]  A big, messy dessert.  But the post-it note story gets worse because after I left here, I was online at the bank.  Yeah.  And I had no idea until I was looking, the teller's doing something, and I'm seeing myself in the black and white monitor that's on the back.  And I see this little square, and now I'm turning my shirt around the ground.  And there had to have been at least 15 people right behind me online, and I had to see it in the monitor.  There's a little post-it note saying, fat. 
[02:25:00]  Next time get one that says, I got a gun, when you know he's going to the bank.  Yeah, so I missed the shenanigans and hijinks.  Gentlemen.  Oh, my loss.  Yeah.  Gentlemen.  What?  Gentlemen.  Oh, nothing.  Oh, nothing.  By the way, free lunch.  By the way, the cleanup from the other show, Al dumped out of one of the fucks that didn't happen.  What a dummy.  A fuck that didn't happen? 
[02:25:30]  How many times you curse, Y-Rock?  I think twice.  Twice.  That was it.  It was twice?  Yes.  Then I'm the dummy.  When was the second time?  The second time was the second waxing.  The first waxing, it let out of, like, ah, fuck.  Right.  And the second one, it went, ah, fuck.  Yeah.  It was like a low fuck.  He mumbled it after his...  He did say it twice.  All right.  Look at the panthers.  How cute.  I know.  How great would a truck be backing over one of my little spines?  By the way...  Panda guts.  That blood would show up great on that white fur.  One of the guys that walks with us, he said that the girl, after we got off the elevator, 
[02:26:00]  she was in tears.  You made her cry?  I didn't mean to.  Good for you.  Why?  What'd you do?  We were all getting on the elevator, and once we got on, the doors were ready to shut.  No, Jimmy and I got on the elevator, and like Kenny, I guess.  There was three of us.  Yeah.  See, every day around 9, 10, this place is a long line for the elevators.  Yeah.  We were lucky that no one was in the lobby, so Jimmy, myself, and Kenny got on right away.  Yep.  And then we're like, well, obviously, we got to wait for Annie.  He's like five steps behind us, so we wait for you. 
[02:26:30]  We go, Ann, hurry up.  And then a couple more guys come on from the show.  I'm like, all right.  And I'm like, push, push, push, close doors, close doors.  Door closed.  At the last second, a girl reaches her arm in and stops the elevator doors from closing.  So I'm like, all right, whatever, it happens.  So she gets on, right?  And now the doors are ready to close again, and she sticks her arm out the elevator to  open them again to let her, one more person come on.  At that point, I had it.  I kicked the elevator.  Yeah, you went like, damn it. 
[02:27:00]  And I kicked it as hard as I could.  You didn't see this?  I didn't know what that was about.  I didn't realize it was somebody got on the elevator.  It was because the door was shutting.  It was his fifth time shutting.  Right under the buttons, I had it, and I kicked as hard as I can.  I think I dented the elevator.  And said, damn it!  Like, fuck!  She was, like, all upset.  She got, like, timid-faced.  What happened?  You want to go on the radio?  Are you allowed to?  No?  Yes?  Maybe so?  No?  He says that she was pretty upset.  But I was just frustrated at that point.  I thought it was a bit. 
[02:27:30]  No, it was a real.  Yeah.  Then I'm thinking, no, Jimmy does bits on the elevator.  Other guys will do a bit on the elevator.  Opie, it's serious.  He's pissed.  He's upsetting this girl.  It was a real reaction.  I was just frustrated.  It just opened up, like, one too many times.  Fucker.  Hey, by the way, we beat up Free FM pretty good today, right?  Mm-hmm.  I thought it was terrific.  And I was getting emails from the gang in Washington.  The gang? 
[02:28:00]  The Crips?  The Bloods?  Which one?  Latin Kings?  The XM gang in Washington.  Oh, they're toughs.  They were listening down there in Washington.  They're like the orphans.  They were thinking, oh, my God, this stuff is hilarious.  They're like, keep it up.  We're laughing our balls off.  I bet you are.  People are gathering around the radios down here because they think this is hilarious and  you guys are losing your mind.  Laughing all the way to the poorhouse.  What?  Taking a jab at him.  Why?  What happened?  Nothing.  Who's poor?  Just saying.  Did you get an email saying, we need more cheese from the rats? 
[02:28:30]  We need a rat update.  They're running the joint up there.  But they thought it was hilarious because we're beating up.  All the channels are changing.  It's the cheese channel.  You start noticing the rats are taking over when it's like the Gouda channel, the Swiss  channel.  Instead of baseball, you just get 24 hours of.  How to get cheese out of a trap.  Whiskers XL.  Whiskers is an XL channel. 
[02:29:00]  And the way they just tell stories, it's just called rat tails.  Oh, wow.  Well deserved.  Well deserved.  Okay, terrific.  Okay, terrific.  So, this is the point I'm making.  It's leading to something, okay?  So, they're writing emails going, this is hilarious because they love when we beat up on regular  radio because that makes satellite radio look so great, right?  Oh, satellite's great.  You can do anything. 
[02:29:30]  It sounded like there's no rules.  We don't want to pay attention to the rules.  There's no rules.  And that's why they were enjoying our little show today down in Washington because they  love when we beat up on regular radio, right?  And we're talking about the naked girls.  That's a brilliant bit, by the way.  Imagining that there are naked girls in the studio, that's going to drive them out.  Yeah.  You watch.  Yeah, imagining.  They're going to sit us down and go, you can't do that anymore.  You watch.  You watch.  You watch.  Invisible people is against FCC rules. 
[02:30:00]  Invisible people.  That's what they're going to say.  You watch.  Invisible people.  We know how this is going to end.  There's going to be a naked girl in that studio every fucking day.  Every day now.  Every day.  And they're going to slowly start doing stuff.  Right.  And by the way, because you're privy to this little inside talk here, we're just going  to make believe from now on.  Yep.  We're not even going to set it up like we did today.  From now on, it's going to be like, oh my God, look what's going on behind you,  Ant.  Yep.  All right.  Have fun.  Wait.  Can I tell you one suggestion, too?  What's going to happen is Tom's going to catch on and he'll tell the lawyers, no, don't 
[02:30:30]  worry.  There's no one up there.  You should get a stripper, like one of the headquarters chicks to come in.  Well, that's where we trickle.  Okay.  Not do anything.  Oh, yeah.  Just be there.  Then he'll run in like an ass or Minnelli will run in.  I want someone to run in like an ass because they think all hell's breaking loose.  They run in and see that it's just us dopes doing our radio show.  Absolutely.  But here's the point I'm making.  So, XM just loving the fact we're beating up commercial radio today, right?  Well, guess what?  It's your turn, XM.  Now it's your turn.  You motherfuckers. 
[02:31:00]  Because it can't possibly be us.  And it's going to be worse because we can curse over here.  Yeah.  What were we going to do later on this week on the O.P. and Anthony show?  Oh, wait.  Someone call up the show and tell us what we were going to do.  We promoted it.  We were very excited about it.  We talked it up.  We had everything arranged in line, organized, ready to go.  Oh, this was going to be a bit that was going to be fun, exciting, a little titillating, creative, involve the staff. 
[02:31:30]  It had all the features open.  Oh, yeah, it did.  All the features.  And we promoted it like crazy.  See, they were laughing.  Oh, they're laughing and laughing and laughing down there in Washington.  Laughing and laughing.  Oh, just laughing.  Well, you guys are just as bad.  What was the bit?  Here's the promo of the bit.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba. 
[02:32:00]  The O.P. and Anthony show is always looking to stretch the limits of human endurance.  So from deep within the womb of O&A Labs comes So Your Pussy's Got Talons.  The O.P. and Anthony show is going to stretch, stuff, and maybe even staple  A Lucky Vagina.  How far can one pussy go?  Eric, run!  Run, you pussy! 
[02:32:30]  Find out soon on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Guess what?  We will not be finding out soon because they said no to So Your Pussy's Got Talent down there washing.  They said no.  The whole gist of this was a girl comes in.  She's already set up in a range.  Porn star chick or whatever.  She has a vagina.  Yeah, strangely enough.  And the staff then comes up with creative things to do with her vagina.  One of which was some kind of ink thing and do vagina ink blots and then try to interpret them. 
[02:33:00]  Another one, my favorite, Danny's.  The Rube Goldberg machine where something marble drops and hits a teeter-totter that pulls the string and does dominoes.  And then a little rubber finger at the end of the whole thing goes forward into her pussy.  Just a knuckle deep.  And then I remember Louis C.K. amended that and said that she should just be in the middle of it. 
[02:33:30]  She shouldn't even be the end.  Yeah, shouldn't even be the end.  Just part of the contraption.  Pulled your pussy in her head, hit something which keeps it going.  They were going to do, I'm looking at the ideas now, a Diet Coke and Mentos vagina fountain.  Now, even if they didn't want to do that because of something, fine.  But something like the Wii remote where you take a remote from a Wii game and she puts it in her pussy and has to play tennis with somebody else.  That's fantastic.  Looking so great.  Warm water, like a douche, and food coloring. 
[02:34:00]  That's totally harmless.  You put it in her vagina with an egg and try to color it like an Easter egg.  Use her as a vagina Easter egg coloring machine.  You can color and rot the egg at the same time.  Make the, make, well, I like the paper vagina football myself.  Yeah, goal posters inserted into the vagina, paint the yard markers on her stomach and chest, and you play paper football.  And then you got to, you know, score over her vagina. 
[02:34:30]  Fill it with water and see how long the goldfish stays alive inside.  Well, okay.  I'm just moving on to other ideas here.  Dip it in a dish of soap and have it blow bubbles.  That's cool.  See if she can't get, like, a little film of soap over the opening and then blow a queef out and blow bubbles with it.  That'd be great.  But the XM lawyers, you know, the same people that are laughing and laughing, thinking we were so funny beating up on regular radio today, 
[02:35:00]  said no to, so your vagina or so your pussy has talent.  Why?  Exactly.  Why?  Exactly.  No answer.  No answer.  No answer.  Let's do it anyway.  Last I looked is...  That's what I said.  Last I looked, there's no rules on satellite radio.  I say do it anyway.  What's the problem?  Exactly.  They're all...  You know what their problem was?  They're nervous about the wee water-drinking dead woman incident.  Oh, fuck them.  What is a vagina holding a fucking controller? 
[02:35:30]  There's nothing going into this woman's vagina that is going to hurt her.  That she hasn't had up there already.  That it's not...  Nothing even as big as a cock is going in there.  A wee controller?  A fucking black magic marker?  Fucking black magic marker.  Felt tip pen.  Fucking black magic marker.  Favorite line.  So they're just as fucked up over here.  Get the shot!  Let's do it anyway.  They're just as fucked up over here.  So, we had a show meeting. 
[02:36:00]  Which, by the way, the other side of this Opie and Anthony thing, Free FM, they don't think we actually prepare or do show meetings.  But we do.  But we do them over here.  And that's why you think we're just going home because you don't see us after this show.  Oh, yeah.  We stay over here.  How many times do we have to go back and forth between studios?  We do meet after the show.  Over here.  Not over there.  Right.  You had best un-fuck yourself or I will unscrew your head and chip down your neck.  Right.  So, uh...  Un-fuck yourself.  So we go, Steve, get in here. 
[02:36:30]  The executive producer of the Opie and Anthony show.  Right.  And, uh, we got Steve in here.  And we said, call the lawyer.  Call him.  Right now.  Right now.  While we're doing our little post-show meeting.  Oh, we got the audio event and I losing our minds as Steve's talking to the lawyer.  Because, as you know, the mics are usually on in here.  Even when meetings are going on.  Yep.  Unless we decide we want them off.  Yep.  Uh...  Yep.  This is no bit.  This is actual...  We told...  Yeah.  I didn't even realize.  I thought... 
[02:37:00]  Like, people thought we could pull it from PalTalk.  And it's like, wow, was that being recorded or anything?  It's like, no.  Oh, fuck.  Wait, it was.  And then we realized we could pull the tape of it.  Yeah.  But this is what was going on behind the scenes when we were having a meeting.  So it's a post-show meeting.  The whole gang's in here and we're going over.  Getting kind of excited about So Your Pussy's Got Talent.  Yeah.  I don't know if it's on the tape, but then Steve tells us, guess what?  We can't do that anymore.  And we get the lawyer on the phone.  Steve's on his little cell phone.  You can't hear the lawyer, but you have Steve trying to reason with the lawyer.  And Ant and I, especially Ant, losing his mind. 
[02:37:30]  Pissed behind the scenes.  Guys, here you go.  Lawyers attempt to squash So Your Pussy's Got Talent.  Is that completely off the table or are there just certain things where you're not?  We want to know why.  Okay.  Why?  We want to know why.  I can't hear the goldfish.  Should we put him on speaker?  Is he a new lawyer?  They're not putting me goldfish.  So it's totally about.  All right.  All right.  It could be changed. 
[02:38:00]  Can we change the activities involved?  Or is it just the fact that we want to do it to a woman's vagina?  It would amount to no more than something being placed in a vagina that is no more harmful  than a dildo.  This is what we have to deal with.  I'm so glad we have this.  This is what you have to deal with if you want to do radio in the year 2007.  I don't give a shit if it's on regular radio or satellite radio.  Yeah.  This is us in meeting mode.  This is the shit we got to deal with.  This is how we have to present ourselves like fucking children. 
[02:38:30]  And as the weeks and months go by, they take a little more away from you.  A little more away from you.  In general, XM has been pretty good.  But this one is like, what are you guys doing?  Don't start going down this road.  It's a no-brainer.  The goldfish, you can understand, because they might say, well, there's an animal thing.  There might be a reason.  Yeah, there's a few of them.  But the rest of it, it's like, what the fuck's the problem?  If there's anything dangerous, then I'm fine by saying, we'll move on, go for something else.  If it just entails her putting something up her pussy, I see no problem with it. 
[02:39:00]  But I'm glad you brought that up, because then this next track,  what's wrong with douche and food coloring?  Yeah, okay.  We want to know what we can do.  What about douche and food coloring?  Douche and food coloring would be a liquid of certain color that isn't a chemical that's harmful.  How's that?  Fuck.  Why don't we just get an EMT?  Slingshot in the pussy.  We've had EMTs up here before.  Anything.  The Wii thing is so fucking harmless. 
[02:39:30]  It's playing a game.  She'd have something up.  Hot wax is hot wax on the entire nether region.  People do that.  It's legal.  Fuck, they do it everywhere.  People pay to have it done.  Yeah, we're doing it at CBS, so that's cool.  Yeah.  Fuck you.  We're doing it at CBS.  More of our frustration.  Yeah, I got a little angry.  I say you do it anyway.  We're just warming up.  It gets really good here.  Steve, what can we do to this girl's twat?  A committee makes these decisions, obviously emerging. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah, this just dumbfounded me.  Here we go.  This is where I really get pissed, because we want to talk to the individual responsible  for telling us we can't do this, and here's the answer we get.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, I know.  God damn it.  What can we do to this girl's twat that's actually going to have a problem with?  Pass the buck.  Right.  Who's the guy?  Who's the guy that says yes or no? 
[02:40:30]  What's his name?  It's a committee.  A committee.  Get the fuck out of here.  All right.  Forget it.  George Glass.  I mean, is it really George Glass?  Do things to a naked girl that's got them upset?  I mean, they had to give you some indication as to what.  When's the merger happening?  Yeah.  When's the fucking merger with Sirius?  Because obviously we can't do shit, because there's going to be a merger.  Keep everything safe and on the QT.  It's satellite radio, for God's sake.  You guys are way too paranoid.  Yeah, we're paranoid.  We're paranoid? 
[02:41:00]  We're paranoid that we can't do bits?  We're paranoid that we can't do bits.  Don't do them, but don't be paranoid that you can't.  I think someone else is paranoid.  Holy fuck.  We're not going to have some woman drink water until she drops dead.  Go screw.  We have a woman with a fucking pussy that, believe me, she's put worse in it than we can dream up.  Go have sex in the church.  Fucker.  Still there?  All right.  He's trying to talk to him. 
[02:41:30]  We're just cursing at him.  At this point, we have FU money, so it doesn't matter.  You do?  Well, trust me, the next one's going to be a doozy.  You don't have a mortgage yet.  Yeah, I don't have FU money.  Me and Jimmy do.  You better give me a mortgage soon.  You're going to rent forever.  That's right.  And then we ask for Elo.  Yeah.  Tell Eric Logan we're fucking pissed if he still works there.  Who the fuck knows? 
[02:42:00]  Tell Mel Karmazin we're pissed, the new owner.  Cocksucker.  So, can you get back to me at least today?  Of course, Steve.  And let me know what the issue is and what we can do.  We've had naked women up here doing each other with dildos.  It's satellite.  No, but I mean, what about a big build-up?  We've done that before.  Yeah.  How about a girl with a penis?  Ooh, it's so unnatural.  I mean, we've had girls. 
[02:42:30]  Maybe if we were doing stuff with some guy's hairy ass, you guys would understand.  Yeah, there you go.  Well, that one got approved.  Two men fucking each other.  Approved.  It's hot.  It's hot.  What was the reason they were giving us to this stuff?  No reason.  No reason.  That's just it.  It's a committee.  So, you can't even call out one guy.  There's no accountability here.  There's no...  Oh, give me the guy.  Put the guy that said no on the phone.  Because I want to talk to him as to why a woman can't take a Wii controller, which is no bigger than a fucking dildo. 
[02:43:00]  Shove it up a twat and play a game with it.  Well, it's a committee.  That's more corporate bullshit.  Committee means there's no one you're fucking talking to.  No accountability whatsoever.  No one you're talking to, you mean to tell me the lawyer brought to a committee in plain fucking dirt street language.  I would love to see that.  What we want to do.  That's bullshit.  Do you guys want to do a promotion that involves a certain part of the woman's... 
[02:43:30]  Because it's a committee, you know.  And they got to be careful because they don't want to get in trouble with HR.  No, no, no.  That can't be done.  None of that.  Whatever it is.  I don't know what it is, but I know.  Where's Elo?  Where is Elo?  Elo's the mysterious of Eric Logan.  I want Logan on the phone in 10 minutes or 10 times as many cock pictures delivered to him as he did.  It made it easy for him.  Jesus.  What?  He's going to call in 11 minutes now. 
[02:44:00]  He loves the dick.  The man loves cock.  Here's the last bit of us listening as Steve talks to the lawyers.  This committee.  What a pass the fuck thing that is.  There's no guy.  All right.  Who's the guy that says no?  Put him on the phone.  We'll talk to him.  Oh, it's a committee.  That's the easiest way to fucking just blow it off.  It's a group of people.  It's a group of people that decides it's the whole we for we thing has them all fucking paranoid. 
[02:44:30]  Too bad.  What?  Of somebody getting hurt.  Of there being prosecuted.  Of there being some kind of friggin' lawsuit involved.  I'm not going to die.  Ew.  She's putting a fucking something smaller than what she usually has up her pussy up her pussy.  It's a porn star, right?  Yeah.  She's fucking been fucked by like jackhammers.  And they're worried about a fucking magic marker.  Filter pin.  Fucking black magic marker.  I've watched Pulp Fiction about 80 times this week. 
[02:45:00]  Sorry, people.  I keep using that every time a magic marker comes up.  I even did it at home.  Yeah.  So that's what we're up against.  Yeah.  It's happening at both places.  Just when XM and Washington thought, oh, look, they're beating up radio.  Oh, that's great.  Well, you're doing the same thing.  We wanted to do that.  Why can't we have a girl come in here and just, like the ink blot thing is so, what are you afraid of ink? 
[02:45:30]  All right, we'll use something, vegetable dye.  Is that okay?  What's wrong with a girl coming in, putting some kind of vegetable dye on her pussy lips, squatting on a piece of paper,  and us giggling about what it fucking looks like and passing it around saying it looks like, you know, two fucking people fucking each other.  How about that water-soluble paint that little children use, hand paint, that little kids use?  Yeah, yeah, that you can eat.  Yeah.  And then Jimmy can eat it.  That's right.  I say you do it anyway.  That's my opinion.  That's what I say, too.  What are they going to do?  What are they going to do?  That's what I say, too. 
[02:46:00]  We get her in here.  We paint her up.  Let's throw her on some paper.  We bring in a Wii.  We have her play some video games with it.  That's right.  I know what we need.  Let's do it.  Let's do it. 
[02:46:30]  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  That's terrible, I'm sorry. 
[02:47:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Gut-busting, ab-crunching.  Boy, how bad can he get?  Have you seen a man eat his own head?  Yes.  Now you'll get used to it.  Anthony spent $300 on fags.  Ass clowns.  Anthony.  This is the freakiest show I've ever been party to.  This is the illegal.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You guys suck.  All that talk is crazy. 
[02:47:30]  All right.  Bunch of dopes.  I don't need it.  I need the Don't Worry, Be Happy, the Steve version on my little thing. 
[02:48:00]  Hey, do we have the Tyra clip on here yet?  No, not that one.  Oh, okay.  But we had it at the other joint?  All right.  Very good.  A couple things, but they went away.  Some guy got a sign up in front of where Tyra tapes in L.A. saying Tyra Banks is a big fat pig.  Oh, really?  Guy was on hold for like an hour and a half.  We never got to him this morning because we were just bitching and complaining.  And now that we bitched and complained, people are jumping on the bandwagon and saying that's all we do, which is so stupid.  I can't even tell you.  It's all we do. 
[02:48:30]  Don't make me start doing math problems again.  It's all we do.  By the way, can I say who made me laugh today, who I actually enjoyed?  Yeah.  It was the awful Linda Stacey from the New York Post.  Really?  You have a love-hating relationship with her.  I don't even hate her because she trashed our show.  I just hated the way she did it.  But this one, she trashed Rules of Engagement, and she gave it absolutely no stars.  Not just no stars, absolutely no stars.  It's a David Spade show, and I've learned to really hate David Spade. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah.  Because he bumped me one time at the improv and tried to be cunty and fucking condescending.  Yeah, in L.A., so I'll never like him again.  And she just smashes it.  And she just smashes it.  But just how unfunny it is.  Not because it was mean or...  Are you digging her?  No, I'm not.  But I just...  Sounds like you're digging her these days.  I just don't like David Spade.  And I don't like his fucking Comedy Central show where he takes...  What does he say?  He takes...  What's the poster thing?  Oh, no.  He does something with Tinseltown. 
[02:49:30]  Oh, the showbiz show he does?  Yeah, some awful safe target shit attacking Tinseltown.  Tinseltown.  Look out, guys.  Tinseltown's getting a goody attacking.  Last time it was called Tinseltown.  Tearing Tinseltown a new one.  Oh, a new one.  Tearing Tinseltown a new one.  How fucking...  I say that and my neck hair stands up.  You have neck hair?  Yes.  Let's wax it.  Oh, I don't think so, Opie.  That would hurt and I'd yell curses.  But I thought we didn't do enough show prep. 
[02:50:00]  Tearing Tinseltown a new one.  Sorry, I'm just reading all kinds of contradictory...  Yeah.  Is someone complaining about this show?  Who cares?  New York Radio Message Board is on our case again.  Fucking assholes.  Because they're jealous.  You get opinions from people that were in radio years ago or wannabes who are just starting  in the business or other people who were in the business for a short period of time and  they get to comment on your job and what you do for a living on a daily basis as if they 
[02:50:30]  actually have some kind of insight on what you do on a daily basis.  And it's really entertaining to read through how you don't do enough show prep, do too much  show prep, have too many people in the studio, not enough people, how it's too much like the  old show which is irrelevant now, how it's not enough like the old show. 
[02:51:00]  Oh, thank you.  I mean, but it's just all contradictory crap and some stuff that obviously a program director  is reading.  But the beautiful thing is New York Radio Message Board has been wrong about everything  that I've read.  They've been wrong about it.  Some of them are smart guys, but like when this whole controversy in 2002 happened and  booted off the air, they'll follow the money, they'll be back all year.  They were wrong about everything.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:51:30]  Mm-hmm.  Let me see.  Oh, good.  Oh, there you go.  It's Ellis Devin.  Ta-ta-da-ta-ta.  Yeah-ta-da-ta.  I think it's part of the...  In fact, the fact that they are on XM and Free FM is a small part of why their numbers are  low in my opinion.  Well, that doesn't explain a place like maybe Buffalo, where we're doing very well in, Boston.  Well, maybe they're saying that in some cases, in some markets. 
[02:52:00]  The XM people are buying a lot of XMs, so that's affecting the ratings.  Maybe they're saying that.  I think it's a part of the problem, but not because New York people are listening to XM instead  of Free FM.  But dividing the show in half.  I think dividing the show in half and their attention along with it is a mistake.  There's this feeling that their on-air version of ONA Lite, while the full version of the  show is unedited on XM version, starts at nine.  XM gives them the option of deferring bits or comments until later, rather than being forced 
[02:52:30]  to creatively get the things over the air, over at CBS.  Creatively for...  Let me tell you something, Alan Sniffen.  Rather than being forced to creatively get things over on the air at CBS, we defer them  to here.  We say, you know something?  We can't get it on the air over there.  So let's just do it over here.  We're forced to do...  Is that us?  Certain things you could never cover.  I would love if that was our fault, and not the fault of fuckwad lawyers that won't allow 
[02:53:00]  us to do dick shit anywhere at this point.  What he's not understanding is certain bits that you defer to XM, the way radio is right  now, not you couldn't do them clean over there.  You couldn't do them clean.  Right.  If the subject matter, no matter how you address it, they won't allow you to make fun of.  There are certain things you just can't touch over there.  CBS has no choice with this setup.  O and A were picked up by XM first.  They're locked in. 
[02:53:30]  Some of the tension on the show used to have where they were trying to say or do things  isn't there, in part because they know they can do these things on XM later.  No.  We would try to do them on CBS first.  It's not even like we can try to work our way around things anymore.  We're shut down immediately.  It's not even like it used to be, let's get a girl up into the studio. 
[02:54:00]  We'll have her nap.  Wrong.  Wait, what?  It used to be we could say, let's have a girl.  She'll take her clothes off.  We'll take this cigarette.  She'll put it in, let's just say, a place and start smoking the cigarette while she's  still able to talk as the cigarette is being smoked, if you know what.  I mean, that's what we do tomorrow on the show, by the way.  Yeah.  That's what's going to happen tomorrow.  The invisible person version.  It's going to smoke cigarettes out of her cunt.  Ghost radio.  See, Alan's got it wrong. 
[02:54:30]  Alan has it wrong.  It's not that we sit there and make this conscious decision to not do it over there because we  can do it here.  The power to do anything over there has been taken away.  Now, you might say, well, then why the fuck did you go over there?  Why did you make the decision to do that?  Things changed so quickly in radio that I didn't have a clue that we would be restricted  this much.  We are trying our fucktest to do a radio show over there that would be compelling, entertaining, 
[02:55:00]  spontaneous, provocative, just all those things that everyone likes to talk about the old  show was.  I listened to some of the old NEW tapes here on XM.  We play them in Best of.  We're playing a lot of them, especially in 11 o'clock hours.  And I say, when did we do this on XM?  Because there's no fucking way this went out over the regular airwaves.  When indeed, it did go out over the regular airwaves. 
[02:55:30]  They have locked down 20-fold to what the FCC says isn't allowed.  The company then took it 20 times past that to not allow you to do shit.  That's what happened, Alan Sniffin, of the New York Radio Message Board.  That's what happened.  I mean, fucking Mike Sicliano and Phil and Harvey and Rob and Harvey and Rob and Harvey and 
[02:56:00]  Rob going back and forth and back and forth arguing a point.  All right, well, one of the pests needs to send the audio of this to Alan Sniffin.  It's Alan Sniffin.  I'm going to talk about what happened to the Opie and Anthony show on CBS Radio.  Just part of the audio where Anthony explains exactly what happened, not his version.  It would be lovely if we could do a lot more over there.  What we have to do over there is stick to a guideline of material that is allowed, not so much by the FCC, 
[02:56:30]  which still, believe it or not, does have a gray area that we know that we could adhere to,  but we're not allowed because corporate policy now overrides FCC policy so many more times over.  We're not allowed to do certain things because corporate says so, not FCC.  They don't even want to come close to the FCC anymore.  They have, this is the equivalent of putting a fucking life preserver on your kid in the car on the way to the fucking beach. 
[02:57:00]  That they don't even want you getting that close.  Don't even fucking get close to the edge.  Enough.  Here's what I have to say.  We, I listened to Opie and Anthony's break about what we were talking about, about them and their CBS show.  And I, open, big, open.  And what they were saying is that they're not allowed to do some of the things. 
[02:57:30]  What are you doing?  Is it a callback?  What are you doing, Asian girl?  Stop kissing me.  Thanks for working in my callback.  And what they're doing,  Wow, you really, you should, you should floss more often.  It's Alan sniffing.  Make sure you floss.  Yeah, that's the deal.  You could, you could crucify us and, and say, oh, well, then why'd you take the gig? 
[02:58:00]  Honestly, I really, it's, it's.  I like doing the gig over there.  I like doing the gig.  I like being frustrated.  I like trying to work my way around it.  I like to show the people how, how painful it is to be back on regular radio.  It also allows us to do things we wouldn't be able to do if we're just on XM at this point, like our comedy show.  It's not.  That's going to hit 10 cities in another month or two.  It's not 99, 2000, though, anymore.  It's not. 
[02:58:30]  Radio is completely different.  There is no, that's why when all their shock jocks, shock jocks.  There's no shock jock genre anymore.  It's, it's, there's no, it's not allowed.  It's not permitted.  The, the, the term is fucking dinosaur.  It's like, it's like using the word hippie.  It's just old fucking hat.  So we go over there on a daily basis and put on a show that, uh, uh, we hope is, is interesting and funny and compelling based on material that's, uh, uh, out there. 
[02:59:00]  Um, um, popular culture, things like that.  But there's no bringing a naked broad in and shoving shit in her.  There's no fucking, uh, uh, taking, uh, girls and, and taking their clothes off and taking a wiffle ball back to them.  That shit's done.  It's gone.  It's fucking ancient history.  Can't even do it over here.  No.  Can't.  They're worried about lawsuits.  Right.  That's the position we're in. 
[02:59:30]  That's the position that radio is in.  So as, as, uh, I'm not a radio insider.  I'm a fan of radio.  Mike, as Mike says, always have been, always will be.  Wow.  You're like fucking seven up.  Never had it.  Never will.  I lurk around these boards to hear about the inner workings of radio from people who I wish I was part of.  What?  I studied radio in school, wanted a career behind the microphone, but because of issues that are irrelevant here, it just didn't pan out. 
[03:00:00]  They are relevant, you stupid cunt, Mike.  The relevant fact is you never fucking were on the radio, were you?  Never had the balls to take the shot.  Either the balls or the fucking talent, you douchebag.  But now you're going to spell out why we suck.  Well, go ahead.  Congratulations, WCWP radio alumni, class of 95, Michael Siciliano.  Fucking wannabe.  WCWP radio alumni.  You wannabe fucking dick.  You wannabe fucking no one. 
[03:00:30]  What, did he, uh, spin the gospel hour on Sunday mornings?  He wishes.  He never got into radio, and that's irrelevant.  Why don't you tell us why you didn't?  Hopefully it was because he had tongue cancer.  Didn't have the balls.  Didn't want to leave town.  Didn't want to leave your best gal.  Your family.  Or you just fucking sucked on the air.  But now you're going to critique a show that's been on for a dozen fucking years.  That took the chances.  Weren't scared.  Go ahead, Mike.  Got fired twice.  Mike Siciliano.  Said goodbye to their families. 
[03:01:00]  To chase a dream.  You didn't have the balls to go for it, did you, Mike?  Go ahead.  Did you, Mike?  Go to the, put N-Y-R-M-B.  New York radio message board.  Put that in a search.  It'll take you to the New York radio message board.  Oh, he's going to shut down.  You got to register.  No, you got to register.  He always does.  I'm not getting to that.  Wait a minute.  I'm not even talking, saying post.  Just put your little mouse icon over Mike's name, and his email address will pop up on the bottom. 
[03:01:30]  Ah, and let him know how you fucking feel with cock pictures.  Send Mike cock pictures.  Let him know why he isn't in radio.  And we'll be just fine in the end.  We're reinventing ourselves.  Of course.  We constantly are.  We have to.  We always have.  Stupid business.  This is the same show that used to play a lot of music.  We're reinventing ourselves.  But showing you the frustration of what's going on.  It's frustrating.  It is.  When the likes of a Mike Sicliano, who fucking pontificates, and his first line is about how 
[03:02:00]  he wanted to be in radio, but isn't.  But he went to school for it.  You know, I wanted to be an astronaut.  Yeah.  But I didn't go for it.  But I'm going to tell you all about landing on the moon.  Do you critique the way Michael Collins flew the ship, or do you just realize he did it  and I couldn't?  Yeah.  I read all the fucking shit.  I read books.  I fucking watched Discovery Channel.  Yeah.  I know what pretty much a lot of the stuff does up there.  And I fired a rocket once a little.  Yeah, I shot off an Estes rocket.  Yeah.  That qualifies me. 
[03:02:30]  I wanted to do it.  I didn't do it.  That's pretty much the same thing as what Michael's getting away with.  So now let me tell you why Michael Collins is a fucking asshole for the way he flew  the command module.  A little heavy on the brake.  Yeah.  What?  That docking was a little rough.  Yeah.  I think you could have made it a little easier.  I like these 1969 references we're making.  Ugh.  Why was there wind on the moon?  Enough.  There wasn't.  There was.  There was a stick holding up the flag. 
[03:03:00]  No, no, no, no.  I saw it on the history trail.  Oh, it was not.  There was wind.  Plus they have shadows.  There's no shadows on the moon.  Sure there are.  No, no.  Why wouldn't there be?  There are shadows.  Sure there are.  No, there really aren't.  The sun hits it.  No.  As a matter of fact, the earth's shadow is on the moon.  That's why there's a half a moon, because the earth's shadow is hitting the moon.  No.  No.  It's not how it works.  Is that why?  It's blocking the moon, yeah.  No, it's not.  It is.  It's the moon's own shadow.  That's right.  I hate to tell you that.  The moon can't have its own shadow.  It has its own shadow.  No. 
[03:03:30]  It bounces off the big mirror up there.  Where's Dr. Kaku?  Where's Michio Kaku?  We're getting Michio Kaku, because, see, it's called an eclipse.  Either way, when the moon's shadow is cast on the earth, or the earth's shadow is cast on the moon,  it's either a solar eclipse or a lunar eclipse, depending on which way it is.  The solar eclipse happens when the moon's shadow is cast on the earth. 
[03:04:00]  A lunar eclipse is the other way, and it gives the moon like a reddish tinge.  Okay, but the earth's shadow can be cast on the moon.  Yeah, but it makes an eclipse.  No, you're not.  You're trying to get out of it now.  Because a moon, when you see a half moon, that is the position of the sun is hitting the moon from that side.  So you're only seeing the side that's lit up by the sun.  See?  Oh, okay.  I see what you're saying.  Okay, then I'm wrong about that.  But the fact, okay.  Give me a flashlight and a tennis ball.  No, no, no.  I'll do a third-grader style.  I'm sure you're correct. 
[03:04:30]  My point is that a shadow can be cast on the moon, though.  Yeah, it's rare, but it's called a lunar eclipse, and it's more of a red.  It looks reddish instead of just a pure shadow that completely blocks out the moon.  Where's Dr. Kaku?  I'm right here.  Why do we not?  He lives near me.  He lives near you.  Dr. Kaku.  Dr. Kuku.  He writes nothing but good books.  He's really smart.  And you eat them.  Oh, I do.  I told him I liked his book in the elevator. 
[03:05:00]  He finally talked nice to me.  He did?  Yeah, he's just afraid of me.  That's really cool.  I'm like, I have your book, Beyond Einstein.  He goes, oh, you should read this one.  It's my new one.  I'm like, okay.  And I got off.  Ew.  Did you have him sign it?  No, I should, though.  You should.  You will.  You will.  Yeah, you will.  I want a picture with him.  Jimmy.  Yes, sir?  He's famous.  We're very smart.  We're very tense in here today.  Why?  And I know you like comics.  I do.  They always make you laugh.  So I figured I would hand over this comic that made me chuckle today.  All right, Opie.  Here you go.  You're going to be seeing it for the first time. 
[03:05:30]  There you go.  Hold on.  This is in the app.  All right.  All right, then.  It's a political one.  Well, read it.  You've got to soak in.  I can't even do the bit.  I can't even do it.  I can't even do it.  It's a good cartoon, isn't it?  Yeah, it's really funny.  It's a reporter. 
[03:06:00]  And he's standing there with that little gopher.  And the reporter says, and this is funny, the reporter says, another entry into the  crowded race for the presidential nomination today.  And the little, what's the animal?  It's a groundhog.  And he's got his little groundhog arms in the air.  He's wearing a hat.  It says Phil, 2008.  It's Puxitani Phil.  Oh, of course it is.  It's Groundhog's Day. 
[03:06:30]  I have such a loathing Puxitani Phil that I can't even do the bit.  I hate him so much.  I love animals, and I want to rip his stomach open with a knife.  I want to rip Puxitani Phil's stomach open.  They're not a cute animal.  I just hate his name.  Puxitani Phil.  It is annoying just to say.  I'd rather have my girlfriend fuck a black guy than nuzzle with Puxitani Phil. 
[03:07:00]  Let's try to get back on track and back to fun.  F-U-C-K.  I mean F-U-N.  There was another guy that called, and he went away too.  He had his girlfriend say chubby bunny as she was blowing. 
[03:07:30]  Oh, I think we need to do that on the radio.  Hold on.  Who says I'm wrong?  Why am I wrong?  If I'm wrong, I'm wrong.  You are wrong.  About the moon?  No, I know I'm right about that.  About the terminology, though.  I think it's a lunar eclipse is when.  And then a solar eclipse is the sun.  All right, Chris.  Good.  Chris.  Meet you, Kaku.  Chris.  Yeah, what's happening?  Why am I wrong, sir?  Yeah, well, a lunar eclipse is when the moon completely blocks out the sun.  God damn it.  The Earth completely blocks out the moon. 
[03:08:00]  Whereas when we normally just see half the moon, it's because the Earth is casting a shadow.  No, a half a moon is not the Earth's shadow.  I'm right about that, right?  Dude, dude.  No, no, you're wrong.  A half a moon and a quarter moon and the phases of the moon is not the Earth's shadow on the moon.  Then what else is causing a shadow?  It's the moon's own shadow.  Take a tennis ball and take a flashlight.  Let's get a flashlight and a tennis ball.  Here's what I'm going to show you.  I'm going to show you a little fucking astronomy here. 
[03:08:30]  This is how it works.  And picture in your mind, if you will, a tennis ball and a flashlight.  Got it.  Now shine the flashlight on the tennis ball.  You got it?  Got it.  Does the entire tennis ball light up or just the side that is facing the flashlight?  Then what would be keeping the other side from showing to the moon, to the sun?  Dude, because the sun's in one spot.  The sun is only in one place. 
[03:09:00]  So the rays of the sun, it's hitting the moon and lighting up only half of it.  When we see a full moon, a full bright moon, it is the sun hitting the moon directly like behind you.  The sun would then be hitting behind you and hitting the moon.  Now the moon does not go in an orbit around the Earth's equator.  So every time it goes around to the further side of the Earth, it's not blocking the sun.  The moon spins around different axes of the Earth. 
[03:09:30]  So it can be hit by the sun.  You will see a full moon without the shadow of the Earth being in the way.  It's the shadow of the Earth.  It's not the shadow of the Earth.  Yeah, the shadow of the...  It's not the shadow of the Earth.  Wait.  Good.  I got a flashlight.  No, no.  I'm sure this experiment will work.  And I got a Ron and Fez bouncy ball.  Will this work?  Yes, that'll work.  It's not a tennis ball.  You sure?  Please, please.  Yes, and that'll be Earth.  Oh, cool.  Okay.  Wait.  Here you go.  Oh, good.  Whoa!  No, I need the moon.  All right, here.  Okay. 
[03:10:00]  How come the Earth is all...  Blow the Earth up.  It looks like shit.  Here's the Earth.  And here's the moon.  I can't see...  Now...  Here's...  Turn the lights off.  All right.  Let's get into this.  Let's say you're here, right?  Okay.  It's nighttime.  Well, it's almost nighttime.  Now, if the sun was shining like this...  All right, that's the sun.  And the moon is here.  All right.  Obviously, there's no light getting there, because it's one line.  It's a straight line.  But the moon doesn't necessarily revolve around the Earth on its equator. 
[03:10:30]  It sometimes is up here.  Right.  Now, the rays from the sun hit it, and look, that's a full moon.  Stay where you are.  Lower the moon and lower the sun and the moon a little bit.  There you go.  Right there.  But that doesn't have...  That's an eclipse.  That is not a phase of that.  But now look.  Now look.  We come around this way.  And look.  Now you're only getting a piece of the light is hitting the moon.  That's a quarter moon.  See? 
[03:11:00]  It depends on where the moon is in relation to the flashlight, which is the sun.  Now, if the moon is here, and it's being hit on the back, this is your new moon.  See?  No light.  No light.  He sounds right.  He knows too much.  You can't see anything.  He knows too much.  I just...  I don't...  I mean, is he arguing too well?  It is the shadow of itself that does the phases.  Arguing too well.  He's got fucking a flashlight, and he's using props. 
[03:11:30]  I said it looks like a shadow because it's black.  That's all I knew.  My question is, if he was this smart, why AC?  I'm conditioning for so long.  Marijuana.  Alcoholism.  And, yes, pot, and not so much drinking when I was in high school, but too much pot.  I smoked so much pot that I would rather smoke pot than stay in the pot.  Uh-oh.  It's a gravity fucking discussion.  No gravity.  All right, now I'm completely wrong.  Kevin, how am I completely wrong? 
[03:12:00]  Kevin, you're completely wrong because the Earth casts a shadow on the moon.  In order for it to be a quarter moon or a half moon, the Earth has to be there.  Dude, it is not the shadow of the Earth on the moon.  It is not.  It is the shadow of the moon itself.  Wait, Kevin, why do you say that?  Why do I say that?  Because there's one dark side of the moon that no one ever sees.  That's the part that's always dark.  It doesn't hit the sun.  Right.  In order for it to be a quarter moon or a half moon, the Earth has to be in the way. 
[03:12:30]  That's why it has a crescent shape because the Earth isn't in the way of the moon.  No, it's not.  Then, again, let me ask you, Anthony.  A crescent shape makes sense with a shadow because if the sun was only hitting it partially,  wouldn't it be a straight line as opposed to a crescent shape?  No, because of the curve.  The moon is curved.  So it shows up like a curved piece of light hitting, and the part that isn't being hit  is the shadow of the moon itself. 
[03:13:00]  I asked you, and I – well, I wouldn't say the shadow of the moon, just the lack of  sunlight on it.  Or, yes.  I could call it a shadow.  Do you hear me trying – wait.  Do you hear me trying to pull the cock out of my ass and, like, agree even though I've  been – I think I've been proven wrong.  But, again, anyone that disagrees with Anthony, like, I'm just going, yeah, no, no, you're  right.  Like, if one person calls, it can be Stalker Patty and go, it is the shadow.  And I'm going – she's right.  It is.  These people that say I'm completely wrong are so completely wrong.  You're just wrong, Kevin.  A bunch of people are saying you're wrong. 
[03:13:30]  Can we get us at real scientists?  That's why I want Dr. Cocko.  What's that, Kevin?  It just makes sense.  It's logical for me to think that.  In order for there to be a crescent shape –  Oh, no, he's just guessing.  I want someone who knows –  They call the dark side of the moon the dark side of the moon.  Dude, let me tell you this, too.  Let me –  Let me freak out on this one, my friend.  The dark side of the moon is the dark side of the moon because we never see it.  The moon – only one side of the moon is constantly facing the earth. 
[03:14:00]  Right.  Yeah, that's what I said.  Because the moon also slightly, slowly rotates at the same speed that we would only see the one side.  But when we have a new moon, when there's a new moon, which is totally black, the dark side is lit up.  Hey, Kev, what do you do for a living?  I'm actually a college student.  College.  Yeah, he's a college student.  I'm on the university.  Yeah, I'm in finance.  I'm not even in science. 
[03:14:30]  I'm not – it's not my maze or anything.  All right, we got –  It's logical for me to, you know, think that –  You know, how can the moon have a shadow of itself?  I just don't –  How can the moon have a shadow of itself?  You think if a light hits a round object that the whole object lights up?  All right.  Is that what people are fucking thinking?  Is that the world I have to live in?  We got info.  Yeah, we certainly do.  Ahem.  That explains it perfectly.  Wow.  Perfectly.  That's actually a better argument than I gave.  All right. 
[03:15:00]  I knew as soon as Anthony started to rotate the ball around the little globe, I'm like,  I'm finished.  I started getting depressed going, I'm just dumb.  No, you're not dumb.  He's just got a lot of time.  He had a lot of time on his hands.  We're dumb.  He had a lot of time than we do.  He had a lot of daydreaming time.  The first two sentences really cover the whole thing.  All right.  Lunar phases are the result of our seeing the illuminated half of the moon from different viewing geometries.  They are not caused by shadows of the earth on the moon that occur during a lunar eclipse. 
[03:15:30]  You're 100% right.  The moon exhibits different phases as the relative geometry of the sun, earth, and moon change,  appearing as a full moon when the sun and moon are on opposite sides of the earth,  and becoming invisible as a new moon, also named dark moon.  Shame, shame, shame, shame on you.  When they are on the same side.  The phase of a full moon and new moon are examples of seasigies. 
[03:16:00]  No way, really?  Which occur when the earth, moon, and sun lie approximately in a straight line.  Okay.  That's it.  It's just a shadow of itself.  Don't call me and tell me I'm fucking wrong.  So we'll agree to disagree?  Ooh, fresh.  No.  The talk.  This is fact.  Oh.  Some opinion we'll agree to disagree on.  I didn't even catch that.  Fucking ass.  No, I agree to disagree.  It's right on the encyclopedia. 
[03:16:30]  All right, well, I guess.  We'll agree to disagree.  They're all bad.  I'm like, all right, well, that sounds right.  Oh, we'll just agree to disagree.  I was ready to say yes, too.  I didn't even catch me how obnoxious that was.  An encyclopedia.  All right, we'll just have to agree.  We're going to part away.  You got that stupid encyclopedia, and I got my brain.  Yeah, I got my opinions.  So we'll agree to disagree.  I got Stan.  We'll be right back. 
[03:17:00]  We'll be right back. 
[03:17:30]  The O.P. and Anthony.  Jim Norton.  Thing.  Forget me not.  You sightless caught.  You dog just shit on my rug. 
[03:18:00]  I thought that was pretty fucking funny, didn't you?  How's that for a sketch?  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  You don't do sketches, stupid.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care, I don't care, I don't care.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Rocking you through this Monday.  Yeah, whatever.  Some dude from their cell phone chalk up another win for Professor GED. 
[03:18:30]  Ah.  Yeah.  I don't have a GED.  I never bothered getting one.  I did, but I was...  I should, probably.  I dropped out of high school because of the whole rehab thing, like my senior year.  And I got sober, and like two years later, I was going to Middlesex Community College.  And I got my GED after that, like three years sober.  Yeah.  GED.  Jimmy?  Yeah.  Was it hard?  Happy anniversary.  Well, thank you.  That's right.  I read about that somewhere.  February 1st.  Some people say 10 years, but it's a little more than that. 
[03:19:00]  No, no, it's 20 years.  It's 20 years.  Thank you.  20 fucking years.  My last drink was, or drug, was January 31st of 87.  Wow.  I was 18.  So my anniversary is my first sober day.  So when you see, like, Tara Conner.  Oh, you probably...  Ah, Tara Conner.  Oh, you don't watch TV.  I'm looking for...  Damn it.  What's that?  She's the Miss USA thing.  Yeah, Miss USA.  That went into rehab.  For like a week.  And Donald's...  Yes.  Stood up for whatever.  Yes.  And now she's out of rehab.  She spent 30, 31 days in rehab. 
[03:19:30]  Mm-hmm.  And now she's, you know, now she's acting like she's cured.  Was she drinking?  She was.  Well, she hasn't drank in a month.  Oh, I mean, like now.  But I look at this like, wow, what a...  Wow.  You know?  It takes a lot longer than a month to do some good idea.  And you can't tell a girl, hey, you know, we're going to take away your crown because  you're drinking and, you know, partying in these bars.  You're only 20 years old and we're going to take away your crown and stuff.  Oh, please don't do that. 
[03:20:00]  And then Donald goes, okay, we're going to let her keep the crown, but she's got to go  into rehab.  And then she goes into rehab and that works for her.  Like it was everything rehab isn't supposed to be.  She'll be drinking again within a year.  Maybe, yeah.  She obviously didn't want to go.  It was somebody else telling her.  She'll be partying as soon as her crown is done.  But she's doing all these interviews now saying how she's cured.  And I'm like, wow, that is the wrong impression to give people.  It takes a lot longer than one rehab stay for 31 days.  She should be hammered next year when she's got to put the crown on the new one's head. 
[03:20:30]  She should just be drunk off her ass and kick her in the cunt.  As they say, there is no cure.  There is but a daily reprieve.  And I remember.  A daily reprieve.  A daily reprieve.  And I remember when I was, I went to rehab, I drank in the rehab.  And when I came out, I started drinking again immediately.  Immediately?  And how long were you in rehab?  30 days.  I was forced in because of a wrist slicing thing.  So I was fucking 17.  I had to go.  And they sent me to a place with a psychiatrist because I had to wear hats.  Did any of this sink in? 
[03:21:00]  I know you're in the rehab.  Yeah, but I'm so.  Oh, yeah.  I changed my life because.  Wait, so you're in rehab because you slit your wrist at 17.  But did you know as soon as you got out, you were going to start drinking again?  Yeah, I knew in there I didn't want to be there.  Like I knew I would drink again.  So you really weren't paying attention to what they were saying?  But I was.  Just going through the motions?  Yeah, I mean, I was listening and I was there.  Or did some of it sink in?  Yeah, some of it did sink in.  Like I remembered what they said.  And I would get drunk and talk to my friends about people in rehab.  I don't want to hear that shit.  But I remember I was out drinking and getting out with my friend Chris.  And we came home and my mother knew I was drinking. 
[03:21:30]  And she told my grandmother, Jimmy started drinking again.  And my grandmother had a plastic coffee cup.  And she went.  I'm trying to get the clumsy cup drop.  Like the cup drop.  She was trying to grab onto it.  Oh, yeah.  Fumbling with it.  She was fumbling it.  She fumbled the coffee cup.  Fumbled it.  She was shocked.  She needed to hold on to something.  And that was the only thing around.  Oh, that's so sad.  She thought it was a light post.  Oh, yeah.  It's so sad.  Wow.  Really?  That's so...  We interrupt this program to bring you the ozone midget sighting of the day. 
[03:22:00]  Wow.  Who saw this coming?  What happened?  Chris in North Carolina.  Yeah, I had a midget sighting.  Okay.  All right.  Okay.  Tell us.  You're not going to do the little...  Tell us.  Okay.  It was a little black midget wearing an Emmett Smith jersey.  Her little arms outstretched on top of her holding a shopping cart, pushing it down an aisle.  Oh. 
[03:22:30]  An Emmett Smith jersey.  Oh, that's funny.  E-Smith, but it's so small they can only put an E-H on it.  It seems indifferent.  And that's about it, or?  Those little fingers on the shopping cart handle.  Yeah.  Meanwhile, back at the show...  She's a whore, obviously.  I mean, I pretty much knew that I couldn't.  Yeah, I think she is.  Yeah, so... 
[03:23:00]  Don't just smack your lips.  Hit that button.  You can...  Can I have a bottle of water, please, from somebody?  Uh, Wally in Boston.  What's up, Wally?  Yeah, what's up?  How you doing?  Good.  Moose...  See you, Wally?  Yeah.  Park is closed.  The moose out front should have told you.  What are you saying, asshole?  That's right.  All right.  Hey, Wally, what's up?  What's up, Wally?  Gee, Wally, the guys are going to think I'm a creep or something.  What? 
[03:23:30]  All right, go ahead, Wally.  Go ahead, Wally.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey.  Hey, how you doing?  Oh, my God.  He's talking to the radio.  He's talking to the playback.  Wally, you just talked to the radio, didn't you?  What?  He's talking to the...  He's talking to the...  He's talking to the playback.  I don't know if it's his bit or he's really stupid.  I like Wally.  I think he's really stupid.  Wally.  Yeah, your mother's stupid.  Your mother's stupid.  Why are you talking to the radio, jerk-off, when we're on the phone?  What are you talking about?  The radio happened to be on.  I just lowered it.  Yeah, you answered it, asshat. 
[03:24:00]  We heard you.  All right, yeah.  We heard you.  You answered it.  You answered the same question twice.  Did I really?  Yeah.  Yes.  So what's up, Wally?  What are you doing, Wally?  You can't get out of this one.  You just looked really stupid.  How are you doing, Wally?  It's fine.  Go fuck yourself.  What do you want, Wally?  Why are you calling?  Wally was an idiot.  I know.  Why did Wally call?  I hope Wally had to hang up because the doctor's coming to tell him he has cancer.  Gentlemen.  Gentlemen.  Gentlemen.  He's cancer-free. 
[03:24:30]  Gentlemen.  Gentlemen.  Anyone?  What?  Anyone?  Nope.  Still no one wants to step forward.  It wasn't working properly on its own.  Huh?  Should this be a...  Maybe.  I mean...  All right.  Everyone.  We're going to do a vote.  A thumb...  One-handed...  Not two.  One-handed thumbs up or thumbs down.  Yes?  Let's have E-Rock tell him. 
[03:25:00]  Or no.  Should we have E-Rock tell him?  Yes.  All right.  E-Rock.  All right.  Bring E-Rock in here.  This fucking sold-up asshole.  This glued-together asshole.  Hmm.  Get E-Rock.  Yeah.  He goes, oh, great.  What?  E-Rock.  Why are you trying to change your Opie and Anthony shirts?  Didn't you have another color?  The other one was stuck under his armpit with wax.  Yeah.  That one had...  What?  That one had wax and hair stuck inside of it. 
[03:25:30]  Are you still sticky?  How's your crack?  That's the problem.  How'd you wipe it?  I've become one with my clothing.  This stuff's not coming off.  He groans every time he sits down outside.  I hope the only way to get in the office is with a load.  Should you just tell?  That might segue into our next fit.  Do you want him to just hand that over to him?  Well, um...  I'm thinking.  Just have him hand it over to him and say, you might have lost this.  Oh, that...  Yeah.  There's no payoff there. 
[03:26:00]  Yeah.  I think it should be done in here.  By a girl.  Oh, well, that's what I mean.  In here.  Well, maybe you should just...  No, I bet he should just tell him.  E-Rock.  Here, pass that over to E-Rock.  Give that back.  And let him...  Where was this...  Peruse it a little bit.  Where was his phone?  Let him look at it.  Look at the name.  Look at the item.  Where was his phone?  This Friday night, I was out, of course, partying.  I was on...  Me, my girlfriend, Than, everybody. 
[03:26:30]  Went out partying.  Was hanging out on the Ron and Fez show, both XM and the FM version.  Got rave reviews, by the way.  Had a blast.  Had a really good time.  It was, you know, reminiscent of the old times.  You know, the good times of just hanging out, drinking with the boys.  And so we're out at a bar and Keith, the cop calls.  There's a problem with the Long Island Railroad.  Since I was staying in town, he wanted to know if he could use my Escalade and drive back to Long Island and then come back to drop it back off to me when he comes into work the next day at the hotel. 
[03:27:00]  Well, got no problem with that.  So I gave him the vehicle.  I get a phone call from him.  He's very happy because everyone loves to just soak in other people's misery or secrets or anything else.  So, he tells me he found something in my Escalade. 
[03:27:30]  I am the only person that drives my vehicle.  My girlfriend has her own vehicle.  There is one time each day, twice a day, that somebody else drives my vehicle.  And the only person that is, is Master Poe.  All I know is that Master Poe pulls up.  I pull up behind his car.  He gets in my truck.  He then drives it to the parking garage.  Later on in the afternoon, and this is during winter because I don't like walking in the cold. 
[03:28:00]  I hate it, hate it, hate it.  He then drives it back where I pick it up here at XM.  And he's the only one that drives my vehicle.  So, Keith found something in there.  And it apparently belongs.  Well, why don't we have Keith tell him?  Is Keith...  Yeah, he's online.  All I...  What?  Well, my brother is thinking of changing the name of the restaurant to F.A. Riley's. 
[03:28:30]  Well, so what's the protocol here?  I can just figure out the A word.  All right.  What's the protocol here?  Oh, okay.  Do we go to Keith first?  Hi, Keith.  But I don't want Keith to blow the whole thing. 
[03:29:00]  Don't blow it yet, Keith.  Yeah, Keith.  Good morning.  Yeah, we want to, at some point, get, you know, other parties here in the studio that aren't in here yet.  But, yeah.  So, yeah, you took the vehicle and found an item.  Right.  Couldn't wait to call everybody.  Called, I think, everybody.  Who got a phone call?  Holy shit.  Wow.  Look at those arms.  That's stiff.  Not only that, Keith has to... 
[03:29:30]  We're going to get a little case of a boy who cried wolf if he's not careful.  Because his message said, call me immediately.  Like, yeah, yeah, I know.  You got to watch out there, Keith.  You make it sound real urgent.  Oh, oh, okay.  Well, you know, sometimes things like this, and you find something like this, it's an...  This person may need this immediately.  Well, when something like this pops up.  Right.  You do, uh...  It's got to suck.  I mean, it was a weekend.  It was a Friday night.  I mean, you never know.  This could be something that's...  I'm sure it was very hard for you to contain this. 
[03:30:00]  Right.  Yeah, I understand.  You're going to throw a punch, and your arm just dangles like linguine.  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  So, Keith, you want to tell him?  Uh, well, I mean, you know.  Where is he?  He's in the...  Oh, there's Matt.  Matt, if you would join us here in the studios, in the studio area.  Poe, grab a mic, my friend.  Poe, first, I want to say, and this is honest, from the heart, I do appreciate what you do 
[03:30:30]  for me on a daily basis.  So do I, Poe.  Especially in the winter, it is a bitch to walk in the cold.  I can't stand the cold.  I'm a summer guy.  So I appreciate that you take the vehicle to the garage and back.  I couldn't agree more, Anthony.  You're welcome.  Where did Opie go?  Anthony.  Opie's under the console like a bomb shelter, like a kid from the atomic bomb under his  desk.  I can't see Opie.  I, uh, I know I can.  He's just dangling limply under there. 
[03:31:00]  Yeah, he's under there.  I'm looking for my contact.  Yeah.  You don't wear them.  You haven't.  You had the surgery years ago.  Um, Poe.  I'm here.  You know I love you, right?  Absolutely.  All right.  How would he know that?  Well, I can't even see him, but it's okay.  Now, like I said, you, you, you, you take, you take the truck and stuff and, um, I never  really remember.  Uh-huh.  No, there was a cell.  I found a cell phone once, but it wasn't yours. 
[03:31:30]  Uh-huh.  Somebody.  And I also found an ID once.  These are the only things I've ever found in my, in my truck.  An ID from, I think, one of the valet parking guys at the, uh, garage at the, uh, Borgata  or something.  But now.  Okay.  Can you think of anything you might have lost recently?  Hmm.  The only thing I bring is that I, is my iPod. 
[03:32:00]  Your iPod.  My gloves.  Uh-huh.  iPod gloves.  What, what is that, Keith?  Shut up.  Do you think there's anything else you might have, is there anything that you, you recently  have gone, where the hell did I put that and haven't been able to find it?  Don't soft soap this, Anthony.  Yeah, I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm trying to just, no?  No.  Nothing's coming to mind.  Mm-mm.  Of something. 
[03:32:30]  Keys, no.  No, not, not keys, not keys.  It would have been something, maybe.  Here's what I'm thinking.  You might have gone somewhere.  You're trying to put a key in a lock and, yeah.  You might have gone somewhere and, and gone like, and then, and then gone, oh shit, I  don't have this.  Right.  So you would have had to go to a location.  Who's paging you?  Yeah.  I don't know.  And, and then, no, huh?  Uh, no, nothing comes to mind.  Could have been as easy as a slip of paper. 
[03:33:00]  Just a, uh, little thing.  Well, just a, uh, an item.  No?  Nothing coming to mind.  I don't bring paper or, or books into your car.  No, not books or anything.  This was actually a, a, a document of some, of sort.  Mm-hmm.  Of sort.  Some type of, um, uh.  With bad handwriting.  Keith?  Yes.  Uh, why don't you just tell Paul what you found? 
[03:33:30]  Well, it, basically what happened was, you know, like I was getting my receipts together  for Kenny from the day's work.  Very good.  Yes.  Organize them alphabetically.  Right.  So I was sitting there while my wife was getting some tacos and I dropped some things on the  floor.  So when I picked up all the receipts together and I started going through the receipts, one  of the things I opened up, well, wasn't mine.  It was, uh, it was, uh, uh, there was a name on it.  Now, I'm not going to say his name.  Right.  Because we know Master Poe is Master Poe. 
[03:34:00]  Right.  It's his business if he wants his real name out there or not.  And I don't think he does so.  Right.  Like that.  Like that, man.  But it didn't say Master Poe on it.  No, it didn't say Master Poe.  So this certain document would say it had your, your full real name on it.  Right.  So that tells you kind of, maybe another clue of how important this is.  Okay.  And, and that was written at the top and then at the bottom of this thing.  And this, this paper was about, I don't know, um, about four inches by three inches. 
[03:34:30]  Could get bigger.  But, but it was about that.  And then it was, there was some writing on it.  Very scribbly kind of writing that was hard to read.  But it was definitely for you.  And you might have needed it to hand to somebody to get something in return.  Anything?  Mm-mm.  Mm-mm.  Still no clue?  Any idea, Steve?  Maybe Steve, Steve's out there.  Maybe that'll help you out, Poe. 
[03:35:00]  Steve.  Any idea?  Okay.  Anything?  No.  Nothing?  Mm-mm.  Wow.  Was there a date on it, Keith?  Uh, I think it was like the 20th of, uh, January.  Oh, okay.  So it wasn't that all.  It wasn't like something that, you know, you didn't even know you had.  And why don't you have E-Rock just hand him it?  Who said that?  I did.  All right, E-Rock, just walk over and hand, hand Poe his document that he seems to have lost. 
[03:35:30]  I'm working on it.  That he doesn't recollect.  Poe, there you go.  Well, you seem to have left that in my vehicle and Keith found it.  Okay.  Is it, are you remembering now?  No.  I'll pick it up this week.  Oh, okay.  Uh, don't worry.  Keith.  Be happy.  Keith found it and, uh, gave me possession of it. 
[03:36:00]  Before you, we...  And, and, for some reason, felt compelled to call the entire room.  Well, I'm sure.  Well, I actually didn't get a call from Keith.  Now, let me ask Paul before we talk about what it is.  We haven't mentioned what it is.  Okay.  How does it make you feel that, like, E-Rock just hand that to you?  Like, honestly, like, what are you thinking?  Not a problem.  Okay.  It doesn't bother me.  Should we, uh, tell everybody or do you want to leave it at that?  It's maybe sparing a few people's lives today.  I can't even see Opie. 
[03:36:30]  He is completely under the desk.  Well...  Uh, Poe?  Yes, Opie, I can't see you.  Thank God.  Um, you do have a saying in this.  Sort of.  Okay.  Oh, boy.  Those are really not comforting, okay?  Oh, boy.  Okay?  Those are not comforting.  That's the okay you get right before the foot comes up and sweeps you across the face.  And you go nighty-nice.  Mirko Crocock. 
[03:37:00]  Yeah, exactly.  That's the okay you get just before it's not going to be okay.  Yeah.  There's nothing okay about that.  Do you want it quick or slow?  Quick.  Okay?  Okay?  Well, I mean, the only reason I really called everybody, like I said, it was a Friday night,  and I mean, he could have had a big weekend.  He could have been going to FH Riley's and, you know.  Oh, so you're thinking perhaps by calling everybody, we would have gotten in touch and gotten 
[03:37:30]  him that, and then he could have gotten it, and that, you're lying in seconds.  Because I don't have Poe's number, so I figured somebody has to have it.  Hey, Poe.  Yo.  Oh, boy.  I'm listening.  You have heard before, don't kill the messenger, right?  So you don't want me to kill Eric?  Or me.  Well, do you want to talk about what it is?  I mean, it's up to you.  Daddy's on the phone.  At this point, I think the mystique of the whole thing is probably worse than the actual, 
[03:38:00]  you know.  Absolutely.  The actual election.  Because if I didn't know right now, I'm thinking butt plug.  Looks like Keith doesn't have the same problem.  Kidding.  Well, it's something, hey, it's something I know Jimmy Norton has used many times.  That's right.  Right, Jimmy?  Nothing wrong with that, huh?  Of course I have.  In Brazil?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  A man's cock.  That's right.  As a seat.  All righty.  Oh, boy. 
[03:38:30]  There's a lot of okays and all righties.  An all righty.  Can I have water, please?  Oh, my God.  What?  You didn't even get the pills yet.  What are you getting the water I'm down with?  Get some of you to pour water.  The man is thirsty.  I'm a little thirsty right now.  A little, yeah.  How about we leave this as a cliffhanger?  Oh, that's a good idea.  Yes, well, I think the fact there's a cliffhanger was the problem. 
[03:39:00]  You know there are certain things that we each get thrown under the bus for, I must say.  And if you slip up, here's, here's, here's, let me, let me let you know a little something.  Here's something the gang likes to play jokes on, everybody.  If somebody, let's say, Danny is constantly doing this.  Right.  He forgets to close his email.  Right.  So I get an email from Danny.  Right.  And it's, it's in the rest of my emails.  And I'm opening them up and it says, R-E, you know, Tuesday. 
[03:39:30]  Right.  And I'm thinking it's some show prep thing.  And I click on Danny's because there are a bunch of R-E things.  And I'm thinking it's show prep.  And it says, Anthony, you did such a great job today.  Uh, I want to take you out for a beer.  You are my hero.  Love and kisses, Danny.  And I look at it and go, oh, douchebag Danny left his email open and Travis or Than got to it and sent out an email to me.  So I send it back to him, calling him a homo.  It's one of those things, if you fuck up, you kind of, you kind of fucked up and you leave yourself hanging in the breeze, quite literally. 
[03:40:00]  Uh, you know, it, it kind of leaves you, leaves you out there.  And this is just like that example, right?  Well, no, that's a smaller example of it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Again.  Yeah.  You sound like you're so far, Opie.  What?  Where are you?  I'm.  I can't even see you.  Well, I figure, you know, when radio ends, I want to go into something else.  So I'm, uh, I'm working on electronics. 
[03:40:30]  I could have been a model.  Yeah.  With his face punched in.  And I know when to punch out.  So, uh.  Speaking of punching.  So, yeah.  Oh, there he is.  Okay.  Now I can see on closed circuit camera.  There you are.  In the final.  Look at Opie.  Ha, ha, ha.  He's under the gun.  Hi, Opie.  I'm not stupid.  He's laying on the floor.  My mama didn't raise a dummy.  So, the, the, the, the moral of the story here is, um, there's so much fair game if, if somebody even trips up a little bit. 
[03:41:00]  And I guess you must have been reaching into your pocket for something.  That fell out.  Keith then grabs it.  He calls everybody.  And then, uh, uh, it just, you know, it becomes something that goes out in the air.  But, of course, fair game.  Um, that's what thrown, being thrown under the bus is.  Under the bus. 
[03:41:30]  Unfortunately.  Line of the day sponsored by Bodogfight.com.  Who's saying that?  I don't know.  So, uh, let's see.  Oh, let me look at the camera.  So, uh.  So, uh.  Where did E-Rock go?  That fucker?  He just left.  I don't know.  It's not like you have to worry about your ass being violated for two reasons.  You do.  What's that, Poe laughing, hopefully?  Poe's sipping water in plenty of years.  So, Poe, what's that? 
[03:42:00]  Is that just for a little, little extra added fun?  Has Poe cracked the smile?  Yeah, he's smiling.  A little, uh, little extra, little extra oomph.  Don't worry.  Be happy.  Mm-hmm.  Excuse me while I whip this out.  Woo!  You know.  Mm-hmm.  Um.  Well, yeah, it's up to you. 
[03:42:30]  I'm not even, I'm not even, I'm not even saying a word.  I, I enjoy my molars, my cuspids, incisors.  Oh, you could get up and leave if you want.  Canines.  No, no, I have no fear.  Matter of fact, you can do whatever you want at this point.  I'm enjoying myself.  Sitting down, drinking water.  Oh, gee.  Should we do line of the day?  What do you think, Paul?  What's on your...  Mug.  I like my tie. 
[03:43:00]  How many lines of the day were there today?  Just one line of the day?  Of course.  That's a nice tie.  Thank you.  It'd be funny if the tie just popped up and smacked you in the face.  All right, I think we've said enough.  Thank you, Keith.  Pleasure.  Oh.  Uh, line of the day is sponsored by Bodogfight.com.  Bodogfight.com.  Keith bailing out and he's a cop.  Jesus.  Yeah, great.  Thanks, Keith. 
[03:43:30]  Starts all his trouble and then hangs up.  He's 30 miles away.  We're three feet.  Uh.  Bodogfight.com.  You want to hear the runner-up line of the day?  You bet we do.  Yeah.  All right, here it is, courtesy of Bodogfight.com.  I think it'd kind of be cool, a little black perspective, see how the black community reacts  to a black guy walking on the moon.  That'd be kind of funny to listen to.  We know what side he'd land on. 
[03:44:00]  That was very good, Jimmy.  Thank you for the mention.  That was what I felt good about.  That was funny.  Thank you.  Is Poe still here?  Yes, he is.  Yeah.  He's got one hand on the console.  It's kind of half-fist.  Yeah, great.  It's not relaxed.  For him, it's relaxed because it's not punching, but it's just kind of clenched, a comfy fist  position.  I learned this from the animal kingdom.  You try to make yourself less threatening and maybe the animal will ignore you.  Docile behavior.  Yeah.  That's good. 
[03:44:30]  Bodogfight.com is a great website.  Why don't you go there and check it out for yourself because I don't have the script in  front of me at this moment in time.  Maybe for tomorrow, I can write it down, write it under the console.  Mixed martial arts.  Oh, yeah.  Mixed martial arts with Russians in the U.S.  Mixed, hard and soft.  And some kind of reality show also mixed in there.  I wasn't laughing, Paul.  I had a little tickle in my throat.  Bodogfight.com.  Here is today's line of the day.  Here comes the light of the day. 
[03:45:00]  Light of the day.  Light of the day.  Oh, hey.  Oh, hey.  Whoa.  Wait a minute.  Oh, he had a curse.  Did I hear a curse?  He cursed again.  Again. 
[03:45:30]  What?  Did he think something inappropriate?  Wait, what?  Oh, God.  You rock your curse.  Wow.  Fucking stab.  That's funny, man.  That is line of the day.  I'll make that into a promo immediately. 
[03:46:00]  That is great.  Immediately.  You know what?  With a little gay porno.  I think that it's kind of good.  Oh, absolutely.  With a guy, like, thrusting, and then you hear,  Oh, ow!  Yeah.  You rock screaming in pain.  Steve, you don't need much of a script.  The audio says it all, man.  All right.  Something just quick.  That's good.  All right.  Is that it for the day?  What time is it?  Wow.  It's 11.02.  11 on the nosy.  Yeah.  I just guessed.  Yeah, it was a good show today.  Certainly was.  I think so. 
[03:46:30]  We had fun.  We learned a little something about the moon.  He's still here.  He's still sitting here with his headphones on.  His headphones are on, so he hears you whisper, you idiot.  That's right.  Try that.  You want me to walk you home today, right?  I'll be.  Try that maybe we can agree to disagree line.  That's right.  I work.  This is great.  I think I could do a show from home like this. 
[03:47:00]  I could see Opie on the TV monitor.  That's going to be my new bit.  Just agree to disagree to everything.  He lays out all this great knowledge.  And the worst is it comes out of the encyclopedia.  Yeah.  It's packed up with an encyclopedia.  And Opie just throws it away as an agree to disagree.  Yeah, as if two great minds have met and come away with no conclusion on something completely  subjective.  It's not one smart guy in an encyclopedia shut down a dope. 
[03:47:30]  It's two great minds have met and just come apart, not 100% sure either way.  He had an encyclopedia and I had my brain and I decided that was good enough.  What a dick.  I should have been a model.  All right.  Can we go home now, Poe?  Yeah, I think it's about that time.  Yep.  Let's just get up.  Hey, can we play that Don't Worry, Be Happy song?  That'd be nice.  Guys, we want to leave when the second hand is on the sixth or on the twelfth. 
[03:48:00]  How about when it's on the sixth and it's going to the twelfth, but then it falls back  on the nine?  And all kidding aside, I got an email from Tom and Joel and John.  They want to meet with us immediately following this show.  No.  Swear to God.  Stop.  Play the Don't Worry, Be Happy.  We got to get to the other place immediately.  We got to get to the other place immediately. 
[03:48:30]  We got to get to the other place immediately. 
[03:49:00]  And Luckyfella brand suppositories bring you your body and you.  Hosted by famed sexual behavior expert, Professor Jim Norton. 
[03:49:30]  I'm a perv and I'm weird, but I'm straightforward.  Professor Norton outlines his very hands-on approach to sexual education.  Wait till your kids are asleep and just lay over one of them.  They won't know.  Oh, Jesus.  What?  For example, the art of foreplay.  The first thing I do is go to the bathroom and take one of those eight decibel shits.  Oral sex.  Why?  Sexual experimentation.  I was performing tushalinga.  And sexually transmitted diseases.  I wish I had AIDS so I could bite somebody.  And for the grown-ups, there's also a segment on marriage counseling. 
[03:50:00]  Honey, you're 41.  Can I finally have the balloon nut?  He'll also stress the importance of lubrication.  You want it to sound like when your muddy boot gets stuck like a quagmire?  Another word to the wise from Professor Jim Norton.  Remember, I'm the same.  Line of the Day is brought to you by Bodog.
