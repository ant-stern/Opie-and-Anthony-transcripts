<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with the hosts discussing their weekend: one detailing his jacuzzi use despite allergies, the other lamenting severe tree allergies and inadequate Obamacare coverage.  The conversation transitioned to the NBA playoffs, specifically the Clippers' success amidst the Donald Sterling scandal, focusing on Sterling's girlfriend's appearance and a Barbara Walters interview, with the hosts using transphobic language in their commentary.  A humorous segment followed, featuring a live webcam feed of the Abbey Road crossing, showcasing endless reenactments of the Beatles' album cover.  Clips from the White House Correspondents' Dinner, featuring sharp jokes from Joel McHale and self-deprecating humor from President Obama, were then played.  The hosts then discussed a Ringling Brothers circus accident, Caleb Johnson's apology for using the r-word, and an apology from the Boston Bruins regarding racist fan comments, further commenting on Jordan Sparks's appearance in a mermaid cartoon.  Louis C.K.'s upcoming appearance was mentioned.

The show continued with a satirical discussion of apologies issued by Brad Marchand and Keyshawn Johnson.  This led into a contentious phone call with "Lady Di," who vehemently denied crack cocaine use despite inconsistent statements.  The hosts pressed her relentlessly on her drug use, lifestyle, and attire, with Bill participating as an enabler.  This was followed by an in-studio interview with Louis C.K., covering his new FX show, including anecdotes about filming in the NYC subway, his SNL experiences (including writing his monologue and interactions with Jerry Seinfeld), directing challenges, and his GQ cover shoot.

The Louis C.K. interview continued, focusing on his *SNL* hosting experience, the pressures of production, his views on Common Core (sparked by his daughter's negative experiences and subsequent online backlash), his thoughts on fame and dealing with fans, and humorous anecdotes, including one about vomiting before an *SNL* segment that was inadvertently filmed by his assistant director.  He mentioned having dinner with Diane Sawyer.  A restaurant owner, bringing in food, briefly appeared, and the hosts touched upon *Game of Thrones* and the radio industry.  

A segment with restaurateur Stephen Starr, intended as a Cinco de Mayo themed food segment, devolved into a comedic discussion about missing tacos and a lack of servingware.  Starr discussed his career transition from the music industry (promoting acts like Madonna) to the restaurant business, the challenges of operating in different cities (especially Atlantic City), and the changing restaurant landscape.  The show concluded with another highly confrontational and vulgar phone call with "Lady Di," this time also involving Louis C.K., filled with insults and personal attacks from all parties, ending abruptly with Louis C.K. hanging up.  The hosts subsequently discussed the call and the overall show highlights, again focusing on Louis C.K.'s appearance and Lady Di's erratic behavior.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  ...of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, good morning, everybody. Welcome. Welcome aboard.  Ooh-ah.  It's 0-8 time, bitches.  It certainly is.  After yet another weekend.  A wonderful weekend.  Things seem to come up every week.  And they go by way too fast.  Ah, yes, they do.  They do.  It's kind of nice. It was that kind of nice weekend.  I don't know, man. It's only 50... 
[00:00:30]  Ah, whatever.  Yeah.  It sounded like old ladies.  Hey!  It'll get here.  I got some quality outside time, though.  You did?  Yeah, it was a little windy and stuff, but...  A lot of wind.  You know, you fire up the old jacuzzi.  Yeah.  Jump in that motherfucker, get the sun on your face.  Wasn't bad.  I'm not allowed to be outside yet.  What happened?  Because I'm very allergic.  Oh, your allergies.  The trees are trying to kill me.  The trees.  I guess if I was a caveman, I was not supposed to survive or something. 
[00:01:00]  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Because how the fuck did cavemen deal with allergies?  I bet they used some kind of holistic solution.  Yeah, rocks.  Rocks.  They just shoved rocks up their nose.  That one's sneezing a lot, and he's annoying me.  Let's kill him.  That's the solution to everything with rocks.  Yeah, they just threw rocks at you and made you go off by yourself somewhere.  Yeah.  Who knows?  Yeah.  Especially with that wind blowing around.  Oh, my God.  It was crazy yesterday. 
[00:01:30]  I need one of those big fucking, what are they doing in New Zealand, where you get in  that big fucking plastic ball-y thing?  The plastic bubble.  The boy in the plastic bubble.  Well, not that, but that thing they do.  They get in those big balls, and they roll down the hill.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  But I need one of those just to roll around the neighborhood.  Roll around like a hamster.  Actually, well, I just told you, I'm on this allergy thing for once.  I mean, you can hear them stuffy.  But just quickly, it just tells you a lot about the medical community. 
[00:02:00]  Some are saying Obamacare.  I don't know who to blame, to be honest with you.  That's just it.  But there's a spray that Dr. Steve turned me on for allergies.  He's like, this one will fucking do it, man.  And it's just a couple pumps in each nostril, and you're good.  So I tried to get that, and they wouldn't allow me to get it, really.  They said you're not covered, right?  Not covered.  Out of pocket, it would be ridiculously expensive.  There's no co-pay that you could even do because of my insurance. 
[00:02:30]  So then I tell Dr. Steve, he's my go-to guy, and he goes, all right, I've got to work around.  So then he turns me on to these two sprays that equal the one spray.  They're the two ingredients that are in the one spray that I cannot get approval for.  Right.  But the two sprays that make up the one spray, I got approved for.  Oh, so you have to do two squirts.  It's the two ingredients in the one that they're not allowing me to get. 
[00:03:00]  That doesn't make much sense.  With my insurance.  But if you get them separately, and then, yeah, you just, you know, it mixes, I guess, nice in the nostrils  because you go, you're good.  Good to go.  How does that make sense?  With that reasoning, the insurance.  I don't know, because I don't like talking to those people.  I bet your old policy would have covered it.  What do you mean?  Oh, really?  I don't know.  Who knows?  I want to blame Obama.  That's all I'm going to.  I don't know.  That's all I blame.  But they just make everything so fucking exhausting. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, it is.  It's a chore.  You wake up, and then you just know you have to deal with the exhausting shit every day.  Paperwork and things.  How does that make sense?  It doesn't.  The two ingredients that make up the one that I can't get.  It doesn't.  Get them separately, I can get.  So, but I mean, it's working pretty good.  I'm a little stuffy, whatever, but nothing like I usually am this time of year.  So, anyway, that's that. 
[00:04:00]  And that's that.  The Clippers moved on.  I got to tell you, this Donald Sterling knows how to fucking put a basketball team together.  My God.  The Clippers won, and they're moving on.  Look at this.  This Donald Sterling is a basketball genius putting this team together.  They ought to keep him aboard.  They really should.  Players love him.  No one cares anymore.  The weekend went by, and now everybody's like, eh, whatever.  Yeah?  Oh, we really want to push to get him.  Well, we really don't care now.  And what, they're going to now find a guy to run the Clippers for the rest of the year or something? 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Come on.  And then that tranny was on with Barbara Walters.  You got to watch that word.  Oh.  No, the broad.  She looks like a tranny to me.  Oh, oh, see?  I thought you meant a real one.  No, she, well, I don't know.  Has anyone checked?  Someone else said that to me.  She kind of has that look.  Is she transsexual?  I don't know.  I want to see her face.  Yeah, I haven't seen this.  I don't know.  She kind of has that look.  She got the look. 
[00:05:00]  You're saying she's hot.  You're saying she's delightful.  And the Nets, the Brooklyn Nets moved on, too.  Because I know you care about basketball.  I'm not a big fan of the round ball, as they call it.  Yeah.  I think the Clippers played the Thunder next.  Thunder?  Yes.  How old?  You don't think she has a little bit of that?  Oh, oh, oh, the chick that was, uh...  Yeah, the Donald Sterling chick.  All right, I had no idea who we were talking about. 
[00:05:30]  Yes.  She's got a bit of, uh...  A little trans, uh, gender look?  I don't know.  What is his state of mind right now?  How would...  Confused.  Confused?  Confused.  I think he feels very alone.  Oh, put your visor on and go fucking for a walk.  By those around him.  She looks like she's halfway into changing into a werewolf.  Is this something?  You were with him, so he's not alone.  What's the bar for science?  I'm with him in a state where I want to help him. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, good job.  You don't want to help him.  You did a good job helping.  To come to his own rescue.  Yeah, really?  With help like that.  Right.  Jesus.  But even so, I think he feels that.  Well, even so, so, so, your pants.  Keep alone.  Can you pause this?  Yeah, she's definitely not trans, but she's, uh...  No, I know.  She's very lovely.  She has a...  I got my hopes up.  She has a slight...  She has a slight trans look.  Some look.  And there's so much lying going on.  Yeah.  Because one of the tells of lying, because I've studied body language a little bit, is when... 
[00:06:30]  A pantomime.  When you start moving your eyes around and darting around as you're talking, you're just lying.  That's bad.  That's a really...  That's actually a very easy one to know.  Your eyes are going...  She's looking all over the room as she talks.  And she's trying to help the guy.  What is she talking about?  Like a cat in a room full of pinwheels.  She couldn't wait to get that audio out to people.  Yeah.  She couldn't wait to get the audio out.  Uh-huh.  When was this Barbara Walters interview?  Was it good? 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  Let's hear the rest of this clip, at least.  You should apologize.  Absolutely.  Did you discuss this with him?  Yes.  Will he apologize?  Only God knows.  She discussed this.  Are you in love with Donald Sterling?  I love him.  With her eyes.  She's hypnotizing her.  I'm not sure that's what I asked.  Are you in love?  No.  I'm not in love.  You love him what?  Like a friend? 
[00:07:30]  Like a romance?  I love him like a father figure.  I knew she was going to say that.  I love him like...  I will be your father figure.  Just like a father figure.  I will rat you out.  Ugh.  Bitch.  Yeah, she snitched on daddy.  She shouldn't have...  Yes.  I think Donald Sterling hates your guts.  Naughty, naughty, naughty snitching on daddy like that.  Yeah, but if she didn't like his dirty talk, he would go, you naughty little, and she didn't  like how he finished it.  Oh, yeah.  Another recording.  She looks like the lead singer from Dead or Alive.  Chris in New York. 
[00:08:00]  Bravo.  Yeah.  I don't know who that is.  Good for you.  Pop up Dead or Alive there, Sam, please.  They had that one song.  The...  Oh, Jesus.  Wow.  That's pretty close.  Oh, shit.  That's funny.  Yeah, Pete Burns.  Okay.  I do remember Pete Burns.  That's a guy?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's a problem there.  I mean, he used to look like that.  Yeah, there you go.  You had the split screen, 1985, 2005, right above that picture, the double there, Sam. 
[00:08:30]  Wow.  There's an issue.  Oh, yeah, you popped it down.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  That's what he used to look like.  Jesus.  Yeah.  What was their song again?  Oh, yeah.  Spin.  Oh, yeah.  The Meat Spin song.  The Meat Spin song, right.  I'm ashamed I didn't know who sings this.  Oh, please.  Considering it's my favorite music video.  Heard it so many times.  I know.  I've gotten a neck injury watching this video.  Imagine being known for the song that is from Meat Spin. 
[00:09:00]  That's fantastic.  You think he's proud of that?  Oh, there is it.  Heard it.  Heard it.  Yes.  Five, six, eight, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.  Look at it go.  Yeah.  I like how it tells you how many you've sat through.  Yes.  The record is 10,112 spins.  Someone wants.  Do you ever put this on with your friends and then say, who can prevent our own erection  the longest?  I've gotten the four spins.  How about you? 
[00:09:30]  Maybe we're in the same room.  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  Meat Spin.  10 million spins.  That's a lot of spins.  I guess she was just babbling over the weekend.  I don't think many people believe her.  I don't think many people give a shit what she has to say at this point.  She saw her in to get some fame going.  Sure.  Although, a bunch of idiots out there, they're all buying that visor.  The visor's really hot right now.  Oh, is that? 
[00:10:00]  Why would others wear it?  I know.  Wasn't she having sex with an old racist?  Why is that a good model?  You want to be like her?  If it was around Halloween, you'd see a lot of those popping up, I think.  Sure.  At the old parties.  Hey, look.  What's her name?  There's the visor.  That's great.  She just, I mean, whatever.  Everyone, I guess, is going for it.  But she just wanted attention.  It's pretty good.  You could see through it, I guess.  And everyone could see you.  Brilliant.  But everyone knows what she looks like.  I mean, what are you hiding?  What are you covering up? 
[00:10:30]  She's an attention hewer.  And then she has a posse of guys that walk around with her name on hats.  Oh, yeah?  Yes.  What the hell is she doing?  She's pretty stupid.  I want to point out Ant's hypocrisy.  What the fuck is this?  Already?  Too early for this.  Michael in Texas.  Hello.  Michael.  Hi.  Hi.  Anthony, I just want to preface by saying, I usually agree with everything you say, but  I have to point this out.  Well, you often fault certain segments of the black population for adhering to the stops. 
[00:11:00]  No, I'm not doing that today.  There's no fucking way I'm doing that on Monday.  I didn't even know what he was getting at.  I know.  Call tomorrow or Wednesday.  I didn't even...  It just fucking started.  Not again.  I didn't even do anything this weekend.  I didn't even like...  I wasn't even tweeting anything about that this weekend.  I kind of laid low.  You were chill, right?  I was chill.  Hung out.  Did a great fucking...  Did a fun fucking taping for Jimmy.  Nice.  Don't say what it was.  I'm not going to say a word about it. 
[00:11:30]  I'm just saying it's fucking hilarious and I can't wait until it airs.  Thank you.  Me neither.  It's part of the new show.  Yes.  Really.  What a fun day that was, too.  Just everybody was really cool and fun to work with.  Everybody was nice and delightful.  We only did one day's worth.  We have more probably in a week and a half or so, but that was just a mandatory...  Had to be done by that day.  Yeah, very cool.  They're all lovely people.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:12:00]  When is it going to air?  Looks like June.  It moved it back.  It was just some paperwork issue, so instead of May, it's going to air sometime in June.  Nice.  In June.  I think the fans will be happy with some of the little folks I have some stuff for.  Yeah.  It was really fun to do and it just looks like...  I can't wait to see it all put together.  Yeah.  I can't either.  Watch them.  It would be funny if they called me tomorrow.  We had a sound issue.  We caught none of it.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, it was good.  Is that the visor you can buy, Sam? 
[00:12:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, it's sweeping the nation.  Why didn't Roland buy one of these yet?  Right?  Roland should be all over this.  Yeah, they're dope.  Well, that's one way to put it.  I don't know if they're dope.  Sam.  What makes them dope?  They're just cool.  They're called the paparazzi visor with protective bag.  What's the protective bag part?  I hate the sound of that.  I know.  Chase, my asshole.  You can get them in any color to match your outfit. 
[00:13:00]  That's cool.  Jesus Christ.  Yellow.  Hello.  Hello?  Yeah.  Okay, yeah.  Sorry, I guess the call dropped.  No, I said we're not doing this today.  We're not doing this today.  All right, okay.  Call tomorrow or Wednesday, please.  All right, well, Anthony, had you seen the new trailer for Godzilla?  Yeah, I did.  Looked pretty good. 
[00:13:30]  We all saw the new trailer for Godzilla.  I do like a good Godzilla movie.  There hasn't really been one in a long time.  Well, the last one was a bust.  That was terrible.  That was so damn disappointing.  It looks like they've got it figured out this time.  Godzilla looked like an iguana.  Right.  Didn't sound right.  Right.  And Ferris Bueller was in it.  Yeah, you don't want a movie with Ferris Bueller.  They fucked this one up, too, by the way.  Why?  I don't want to ruin it for everybody.  Oh, no.  The monster looks amazing.  Yes.  But he has sneakers on.  Oh, see, why did they do that? 
[00:14:00]  Oh, man.  It looks good, though.  The trailer looks really good.  And I like the classic Godzilla sound.  You know, you need that.  Anyone see the amazing Spider-Man over the weekend?  He stinks, and I don't like him.  92 million.  92 mil?  That's not bad.  That ain't too shabbly. 
[00:14:30]  Getting a jump on the summer movie season.  This is Spider-Man 2.  Oh, it is?  Summer movie season already?  The first big blockbuster hit of the what?  I think they try to go a little early nowadays, right?  Yeah.  Jump on the competition.  Yeah.  Godzilla 1998 chase scene.  Why are the helicopters going through the buildings?  Like, why don't they fly a little higher?  Yeah, they would.  Avoid the buildings.  They don't have to take the roads.  And avoid the tail.  Right.  Right.  Godzilla could do a lot of damage with that tail. 
[00:15:00]  So they wouldn't get lost if they were following him, because they'd be above him.  That's a great point, Ed.  It's so stupid.  Yeah, I mean, Godzilla really can't hide.  No.  Yeah.  All you gotta do is listen.  Come on.  You almost got it down.  A little echo.  Yeah, a little echo.  A little pitch.  Yeah.  I spend most of my weekend mesmerized by just dopey people.  Well, plenty of them.  I gotta thank Guyism, which is on Twitter. 
[00:15:30]  Pretty good website.  Pretty good Twitter account.  And they were talking about webcams.  Yeah.  And they're like, the top, I think they had the top ten webcams that you should be checking  out.  And none of, and it goes, and they said, we'll acknowledge there's a lot of really good  sex ones, but besides those.  Besides the sex ones.  Like, there's one on the space station, I guess.  Right now you can check out the space station.  Isn't that correct?  And see what they're doing.  It's on all the time.  And they'll show you views of Earth and all that.  But there's one where it's Abbey Road in London. 
[00:16:00]  And it's the exact crossing, obviously, where the Beatles did their, you know.  Sure.  All four Beatles doing the walk across the street thing.  The crosswalk, yeah.  And do you know, to this day, people will walk across there and try to reenact the cover  of that famous album.  So the webcam is on.  And all you do is watch these people crossing.  There's no real light there, so they're almost getting hit by cars. 
[00:16:30]  People will stand in the middle of the road.  And I watched this dumb thing for hours.  How many people do you think have taken their picture there like that?  I don't know.  Millions.  Go to abbeyroad.com slash, oh, freak, crossing maybe or something like that.  I wonder how many people did it at the wrong place on Abbey Street.  It's in the ghetto, beaten up.  Looks nothing like it.  No.  This, I tweeted it, too, if you follow me on Twitter, but, I mean, I think this is it. 
[00:17:00]  And, uh, it's mesmerizing.  When you're just doing your regular shit on the computer and you have a window open with  this, it is so bizarre.  And everyone thinks they're being, we can't get it up.  Oh, I hear that.  How many times have I whispered that to myself?  Live from Times Square.  I know.  We don't need live from Times Square.  Just look out the window for that.  All right.  Here we go.  Oh, there it is.  And this is live right now?  Live right now.  Yeah, yeah.  See all the people on both sides?  They're all waiting.  Yes. 
[00:17:30]  And this, this isn't a loop.  This is just happening all the fucking time.  Wow.  All day long.  They have to wait for the cars to stop.  Right.  There's a lot of traffic.  You know, you watch a couple and then you just need to keep watching.  And then you get the, the pissed off drivers that start beeping like crazy because they're  taking too long.  Meep, meep.  Look, these people are trying to figure out what they can go for.  That's a busy-ass road.  Yeah, there's no, all right.  And...  Oh, so I'm going to go?  No, another car.  And...  But who goes first? 
[00:18:00]  Oh, who's stopping?  Oh, somebody's slowing down.  Yeah, who goes?  All right.  Those people just were...  People are just really crossing the street.  Yeah, there are people that are really just crossing the street.  One of those double-decker buses.  Yeah.  There are guys that ride this road to work every day and every day go, look at these fucking  assholes.  Right.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, they're just standing.  There's a clump on either side waiting across.  What a busy-ass road.  I guess it's, uh...  I don't know what time it is over there, but it seems...  Six hours difference.  Look at how fucking busy this is.  No one's going to get a picture. 
[00:18:30]  No, I...  Oh, oh.  This is the longest I've seen it where no one is even attempting a picture.  Here we go.  Here we go.  No, bicycle.  Bicycle.  Another car.  Wow.  Car, car.  I think we hit up the webcam when it's really very busy.  This is like rush hour in fucking England?  What the fuck?  And Abbey Road?  Did you get the wrong side of the street thing?  Oh, there they go.  Quick, take a picture, you bloody idiot.  Of course this webcam is going to make me look stupid.  Of course.  Even though I saw hundreds of people try it. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, here we go.  Now someone's trying.  My sister and Patrick.  Watch, watch, watch.  See, there's the person.  This is the stupidest thing ever.  Bunch of people standing there.  And here comes the car.  And the cars are like, all right.  And they freeze frame.  There's...  I come flying around the corner with my horn blaring.  The guy just stroked around the photographer.  There's a guy just standing there.  Right.  Get off the road, you wanker.  Did you see how they all lined up and they all had their pose ready? 
[00:19:30]  Guys.  All day long.  They're driving on the wrong side of the road, by the way.  This is terribly dangerous.  It really is weird to watch them drive like that.  They keep making a left, right thing.  A car is going to be coming around.  They're all going to die.  There's another one.  Wow.  That took a long time, though.  Yeah.  But those people are happy.  Oh, yeah.  They got their little picture.  They got the pretty good shot there.  I could watch this all day, too.  They're all waving at the webcam.  It is the dumbest thing, but I could watch all day.  Look, there's another one. 
[00:20:00]  Look, with the pose.  Yeah.  Just one is kind of silly.  Who's taking the fucking camera?  Car's coming.  From the car.  She almost just walked in front of the car.  Oh, please let someone get killed.  That would rule.  Yeah.  These people want to...  Wow.  Oh, man.  They're fucking everything up.  Yeah.  People are confused which way the Beatles walked originally.  Which way did they go?  Left to right or right to left?  Right.  I don't know.  It is amazing that the street is painted the exact same way it was with those dumb squiggly lines.  The squiggly line is not in the original shot. 
[00:20:30]  Oh, it's not?  I thought it was.  I did a little research over the weekend.  Are you sure?  I'm almost positive.  I remember seeing the squiggly line and being like, why do they have squiggly lines in England?  But I guess they squiggle the lines before a crosswalk.  Maybe it was a...  Oh, is that why they do that?  Yeah, I think there is a squiggly line.  That's pretty smart, actually.  Yeah, why not?  See, no crosswalks coming.  Here we go.  Go, go, go.  See, there it is.  There's new people.  Take another picture.  Assholes.  They just stop mid-walk.  Just new people all the time.  Car coming.  All day long.  Here comes a lorry. 
[00:21:00]  I want to know how many people, if any, have been killed.  There's someone had to have gotten hit.  Someone had to have gotten hit.  Had to have.  Oh, this guy's taking forever getting this shot.  Oh, he's doing a...  And then they go to run right in front of the cars.  They just ran right in front of traffic.  Wow.  Fucking tourists.  I can see why you watch this for hours.  There's a sound.  It's the dumbest thing.  There's nothing going on.  But we haven't got a pissed off driver yet that just lays on the horn.  Did you hear any beeping when you watched it?  Oh, a ton.  A ton. 
[00:21:30]  I think it's...  I don't know what time it is.  You say it's...  Six hours.  Is it?  It's, uh...  Oh, here it goes.  Here they are.  More people.  More people.  Uh-oh.  Set it up, you dummy.  They're not setting up.  There's a big fucking double-decker buzz.  This guy can't turn because they're in the way.  Do you think the cars are used to this?  Oh, they probably are.  The local traffic probably is so pissed every day.  On the weekend, it was crazy how many people were there.  Oh, I bet. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  This is a little light.  A little light.  Do you think on Beatle Anniversaries that place gets busy?  Oh, man.  But we've seen at least five already, right?  Yeah.  At least.  Yeah.  So, I did that for hours yesterday.  Three fucking hours.  Pretty fucking funny.  Could you punch up the original thing now?  I'm curious as to whether they have the squiggly.  It's not squiggly.  It's not squiggly?  No.  Oh, man.  It's not squiggly.  Here, let's look at one more.  Maybe I had seen it, um...  Is that what that means, though?  The leading up to a crosswalk?  I think so.  Maybe they just changed the rules. 
[00:22:30]  Maybe they changed the rules.  Yeah, the rules are different now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Huh.  Oh, the Times Square one.  Timeskewia.  What could you do in Times Square on an Earth cam?  Who cares?  Yeah, you just look.  Oh, look.  There's a lot of people.  It's crossroads of the world.  Sure.  How many people are getting hit by cars?  I saw a lot of near misses yesterday, so you've got to think someone's got clipped.  Oh, God, yeah.  They probably took, you know, a bumper to the hip or something.  I don't think anything too tragic, but... 
[00:23:00]  No.  There you go.  See?  No squigglies.  Oh, no squiggly lines.  What is that?  It's them.  Photography's weird.  Because the webcam doesn't do that picture justice.  No.  It's a very busy intersection, but that makes it look like it's almost like a side street  or something.  Maybe they had somebody close off traffic.  Oh, well, you think?  That's nice to run it over the Beatles.  You think?  Can't run over the Beatles.  Oh, the Simpsons did it.  Damn, when were they there doing it?  That doesn't even look like the intersection. 
[00:23:30]  Huh?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  They should do something to make traffic not go there.  Yeah.  Or to not get tourists to build something in the road.  Like a Roy Rogers.  You know how mad the fucking Brits would be if we came over and just built a Roy Rogers  in the middle of the street?  Fuck it all up.  Some dumb American shit-making restaurant?  Yeah.  Put landmines down.  There you go.  Jose in Vegas.  Could you go back to the webcam?  It's very addicting, please.  Jose. 
[00:24:00]  Yes.  What's up, buddy?  Happy Cinco de Mayo.  Happy Cinco de Mayo to you, boy.  Oh, hi, Jose.  Yeah.  I was there like two years ago, and the first place that I went in London was Abbey Road.  I went down there, and it really is completely busy.  Yeah.  There's absolutely no real way that you just kind of recreate the actual cover.  You pretty much have to run because buses and others like us.  Well, that's what we were looking at. 
[00:24:30]  That's not what we were saying.  There's no rhyme or reason why the cars are stopping, because it doesn't look like there's...  No.  I guess if you enter the crosswalk, the rule is you've got to stop immediately, because  I don't see any lights or any stop signs or any of that shit.  Don't walk.  There's a lot of crosswalks in England without lights or signs.  Yeah.  Right.  Like it's just...  You're supposed to...  The pedestrian has the right of way, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But if you're going to take fucking dumb pictures like the Beatles, I could see them getting  a little pissed.  But, I mean, all day long, day after day, they're doing this. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  It's the...  I mean, it's a very douchey thing to do.  I even felt douchey doing it, but like, you're there.  But he did it.  Well, you have to.  I understand, because I did the JFK thing with me and Oprah in Dallas, like the alternative  couple traveling in like 2004.  That's why I feel bad that I'm calling these people dope, because I did the exact...  We did it.  We did the JFK thing.  You've got to stand on the X.  But that is even a busier road, man.  They come flying down the hill.  It's a slight hill.  Yeah.  But they don't give a fuck in Dallas. 
[00:25:30]  They've had it with Dealey Plaza.  Have they?  Oh, my God.  We...  We...  It made Jimmy's act one of his...  Yeah.  ...one of his bits.  We saw a woman almost just fucking buy it.  It was great.  She stepped in front of a car that was flying down the hill.  All right, Jose.  Thank you.  All right, cool.  Thanks, guys.  You got it.  So, that was a wonderful find for me over the weekend.  And then you get people.  They don't even have cameras.  They just want to walk across...  Yeah. 
[00:26:00]  ...this intersection.  No, but they walk like the Beatles.  Oh, they do.  With no one taking video or snapshots.  Maybe they're doing selfies.  Yeah.  I want to see one more.  Look at all those people.  They just want to do this.  No, no.  No, no.  This is a good...  A good cam, too.  Very fluid.  All right.  These people are definitely going to go for it.  They're getting scared.  Oh, look.  Someone's mad.  All right. 
[00:26:30]  All right.  Here's the person with the picture.  Here they are.  Oh, God.  Look at how stupid they look.  They're not even doing it right.  But they do got the four in this one.  Oh, a car.  Uh-oh.  Beep.  I can't believe no one has beeped yet.  Oh.  And then they run across the street.  Boy, that left turn, right turn thing is wacky right there.  Right.  But that wrong side of the road thing.  Americans.  We always say wrong side of the road instead of the opposite side of the road or anything.  Right.  Like we're right and they're wrong. 
[00:27:00]  We're being a good friend of the free world.  Here it is.  Fucking just popping on England.  Now it's just distracting.  I understand.  The future's amazing.  We'll keep it up there.  We'll just keep the volume down.  So.  Yeah, this Ringling Pros thing was brutal.  Did you see the video?  Uh-oh.  It was the acrobats that do all their stuff attached to their hair.  Oh, that thing?  Yeah.  Where they fucking spin and all that shit. 
[00:27:30]  But they had about eight or at least eight of them up in the air, all spinning at the same  time from their hair.  And the whole apparatus collapses.  They fall two stories.  I thought maybe Maury was, uh...  But no one died, I don't think.  Oh, yeah?  Some busted legs, probably.  Oh, whoa.  Is that a guy landing upside down?  He landed upside down?  How did that happen?  Yeah, more than an incident.  You can see the fire, the thick black smoke rising into the sky.  Did he get out?  The 77-year-old stunt pilot.  You can see that he was flying upside down. 
[00:28:00]  He was actually performing a trip when his plane slammed into the tarmac, happened in front  of thousands, at Travis Air Force Base in California.  Oh, Travis.  The thoughts and prayers go out to the family.  Thoughts and prayers.  Thoughts and prayers, everybody.  There's an air show disaster every spring and summer now.  Yeah, yeah.  We get at least one of these a year, right?  77-year-old pilot.  And he was flying upside down.  Why would he try to land upside down?  What, did he just get too close, I guess, right?  Obviously he had a problem, yeah.  Right. 
[00:28:30]  Ah.  Poor bastard.  Here's the circus.  He went like he wanted to, though.  He died like he wanted to, burning to death in a fucking plane.  Jesus.  Here's the apparatus where they're all swinging from their hair.  After this.  Oh, here you go.  Watch this really fast.  It's that thing?  Oh, it's a big carousel-looking thing. 
[00:29:00]  All hanging by their hair?  Wow.  Oh!  The music's still playing.  Well done.  That's amazing.  They turn off the lights, though.  No one's screaming because they probably think it's part of the act.  Yeah, they're going to be disappeared or something.  Right.  Come popping up somewhere else.  Did anything die?  I don't think so.  Wow.  How did no one...  I believe they just...  A lot of broken bones.  Someone's in trouble.  Who rigged that? 
[00:29:30]  Jesus.  Yeah.  It was faulty or something like that.  Faulty.  Yeah.  And then I'm hearing Joel McHale did a great job at the White House Correspondents' Dinner.  Oh, yeah?  He stopped by here before he did it.  I saw the first five minutes.  It was really good.  Yeah?  Really good.  Yeah, I just had to leave him.  I didn't see it.  Damn it.  Wait, ballsy.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  But you know what sucks?  Like, Joel McHale's clips aren't really going anywhere.  It's all about, you know, Obama.  Obama being funny, even though every single joke was written for him. 
[00:30:00]  Well, yeah.  All he had to do was read.  That's what he does best.  But he's not even there in the process, like, maybe pumping it up and going, ah, nah.  Get it on the teleprompter.  They probably just...  They handed him the joke and said, here you go.  You're now going to be funny for everybody.  And that's what everyone's saying.  Obama, he's hilarious.  He certainly is.  I usually start these dinners with a few self-deprecating jokes.  After my stellar 2013, what could I possibly talk about? 
[00:30:30]  I admit it.  Last year was rough.  Sheesh.  At one point, things got so bad, the 47% called Mitt Romney to apologize.  Of course, we rolled out healthcare.gov.  That could have gone better. 
[00:31:00]  In 2008, my slogan was, yes, we can.  In 2013, my slogan was, control, alt, delete.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  Happened.  Throwing himself under the bus.  That's crazy.  Well, do we have Joel McHale's jokes?  They're way better.  Maybe we can get some for later on in the show.  Yeah, let me hear it, Joel. 
[00:31:30]  Joel?  Yeah.  Joel McHale.  Packed.  All right, everybody.  Here we go.  I am the last person standing between you and your after party.  So, in just an hour and 15 minutes, you'll be walking out of here, all right?  I'm going to break Jay Leno's record tonight.  Strap in.  Here we go.  Good evening, Mr. President.  Or as Paul Ryan refers to you, yet another inner city minority relying on the federal government 
[00:32:00]  to feed and house your family.  Holy shit.  I'm a big fan of President Obama.  I think he's one of the all-time great presidents, definitely in the top 50.  Please explain that to Jessica Simpson.  You're right.  That was love.  All right.  How about the president's performance tonight, everyone?  It is amazing that you can still bring it with fresh, hilarious material. 
[00:32:30]  And my favorite bit of yours was when you said you'd close the detention facility at  Guantanamo Bay.  That was a classic.  That was hilarious.  Hilarious.  Wow.  Jesus.  Still going.  Oh, man.  Take a moment to recognize the first lady.  This is Obama.  You have been very kind to me and my family, especially when you showed us all how to tear 
[00:33:00]  a phone book in half with your bare hands.  Holy shit.  It's a credit.  I'd also like to thank the White House Correspondents Association for having me and for not being  able to book Jimmy Fallon.  That's true.  All right.  I guess Fallon said no.  Look.  That's true.  I know it's been a long night, but I promise that tonight will be both amusing and over quickly,  just like Chris Christie's presidential bit. 
[00:33:30]  I got a lot of these tonight, so buckle up, Governor Christie.  Excuse me.  Extender buckle up.  All right.  Oh, man.  That joke's galore.  I deserve that.  I agree on that one.  That you're right on.  Now, allow me to tell you a little about myself.  My name is Joel McHale.  I'm on an NBC show called Community.  Clause break.  That's exactly what I thought. 
[00:34:00]  I also host a show called The Soup, which is on the E! Network.  Thank you.  To Republicans in attendance, E! is the channel that your deeply closeted gay son likes to watch.  Democrats, it's the same channel that your happy, openly gay son likes to watch.  He is also home to the Kardashians, who, believe it or not, are Republicans.  And I know that because they're always trying to screw black people. 
[00:34:30]  That's a good one.  Oh, that's a good one.  Now it's just the men.  Okay.  It's an honor to be here tonight at the Washington Hilton.  I'm tingling with excitement.  Or maybe that's just the bed bugs.  I hope you all enjoyed your dinner.  The filet tonight was grass-fed beef, freshly dragged off the Clive and Bundy ranch. 
[00:35:00]  The steaks are very tasty once you pull off the tiny white hoods.  Oh, see, oh, you like Clive and Bundy.  Okay, I get it.  All right, great.  All right, let it be known.  That's a record show.  All right.  That's a record show.  Tonight's show is being broadcast on C-SPAN.  C-SPAN is, yeah, C-SPAN is like one of those paranormal activity movies.  It's just grainy shots of empty rooms interrupted by images of people you're pretty sure died a few years ago.  Yeah. 
[00:35:30]  Big funny fucking jokes.  Oh, and stay tuned after the correspondence dinner for an all-new episode of C-SPAN's hit show,  So You Think You Can Remain Conscious.  This is the 100th year of the White House Correspondents' Associates.  Hashtag Total Sausage Fest.  But that's all changed.  Now America is truly a land of diversity.  Only here would you find a black president, a soon-to-be Hispanic majority, 
[00:36:00]  and all 19 nationalities contained within Arianna Huffington's accents.  That was low.  It's a genuine thrill to be here in Washington, D.C.,  the city that started the whole crack-smoking mayor craze.  You guys were the first.  I hope he's not here tonight.  People say that Toronto may have run for it. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, yeah, it keeps going.  I mean, Joel's killing it.  He's great.  Probably worth checking out the whole thing at some point in your leisure.  These are dumb people are, like, on Twitter.  People like, uh, I didn't think he was up for it.  You could not like him, but they're like, uh, the crowd hated him.  What?  They're not hating him.  They're not hating him?  No, not at all, actually.  That's a notoriously brutal room.  Right.  Yeah.  He did very, very well.  Boy, what a set of balls.  Yeah.  To be able to blurt some of those lines out.  Right.  Holy shit.  You got another one from Obama, too. 
[00:37:00]  I am happy to be here, even though I am a little jet-lagged for my trip to Malaysia.  The links we have to go to, to get CNN coverage these days.  Jesus Christ.  I think they're still searching for their table.  Wow. 
[00:37:30]  Do you want to keep watching?  That's, and I'm, that's a great joke.  The fucking president of the United States just made fun of a plane full of dead people.  No.  Holy shit.  It's pretty amazing, right?  Yeah.  MSNBC is here.  They're a little overwhelmed.  They've never seen an audience this big before.  That's like his private fucking news channel, too. 
[00:38:00]  Wow.  Jesus Christ.  Good for Obama.  We have more of his jokes.  We'll do a little later, I guess.  Some of his jokes.  Some more of those jokes.  Anyway.  That's great.  Why don't we take our first break so we can eat some food?  Oh, certainly.  Is it Louis C.K. Day?  Yes, it is.  Louis is coming in, huh?  The review on the new show is great.  Yeah.  When is it there?  Tonight.  Oh, okay.  Two episodes tonight starting at, I want to say, 10, right? 
[00:38:30]  10 o'clock.  You get two episodes of Louis tonight.  And then every Monday it's going to be two episodes, huh?  What?  For seven weeks.  For seven weeks.  Wow.  Why do they do that?  Yeah, why are they doing that?  I guess we'll have to ask Louis.  You know, he's coming in.  Why not ask him?  We'll ask him personally.  It'll be great to see him.  And our pal is on the cover of GQ magazine.  Wow.  Look at that.  Oh, look at that. 
[00:39:00]  The 15 funniest people alive with, duh, Louis C.K.  America's undisputed king of comedy.  Wow.  King of comedy.  Very cool.  Rupert Pupkin.  And he's in a suit.  He is.  His suit looks very GQ.  His face, not so much.  He's kind of making that, eh, what am I doing here face?  But the suit looks good.  The suit looks great.  Louis looks good.  What are you kidding me?  GQ.  There's a guy that probably never, ever envisioned himself on the cover of GQ magazine. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  And I don't think anybody else did either.  No.  No one ever saw Louis on the cover of GQ.  Well, certainly we'll be asking him about this as well.  That's fucking great.  We're going to step aside.  Before Louis comes in, I believe we're going to go through our apologies.  Well, there's been some over the weekend, right?  Yes.  We got at least two, sort of a third.  Why didn't we just go a week?  Did we honestly think we would have to take ten days before we got an apology?  Meanwhile, they roll in daily, multiple times? 
[00:40:00]  Ten is a nice number.  Is it a nice number?  Yeah, we're attempting to go ten days on the Opie and Anthony show without having to read or talk about someone's apology out there.  This fake apology bullshit that goes on in this country.  Should Obama apologize for that airplane joke.  The airplane crash joke.  I'm sure Fox News will rip them apart about that today.  Is it really appropriate for a president to make jokes about a plane where people died? 
[00:40:30]  Right.  Relax.  Sometimes you could just loosen that tie a little, Fox.  Wow, you're saying that.  Very nice.  So we'll do the apologies next.  Stay there.  Got Louis C.K. coming in.  Been about a half hour or so.  Very excited about that.  So we got some apologies. 
[00:41:00]  We certainly do.  Thank goodness.  I think we made it three days.  Three days?  We had apologies on Friday, right?  Oh, yeah.  So, yeah, we've made it three days.  Is American Idol still on the air?  When I saw this headline, I'm like, is that show still on the air? 
[00:41:30]  The oddest thing, I have not watched that show in literally years and years.  And I tuned in and watched that episode where he had to sing that song.  Yeah.  What happened?  I guess the audience got to pick what songs these people were supposed to sing.  Okay.  Like songs they probably wouldn't sing themselves.  And one guy had to sing one of the songs.  But they were all prepared.  I know.  But they're all prepared, though.  Exactly.  Because it's a list of songs that it could be. 
[00:42:00]  Is that what it is?  Yeah, of course.  But I'm sure there are certain songs they don't want to sing.  Like, oh, I wouldn't want to sing that song.  I would imagine the audience is told to pick from this particular list, though.  Yes, you're not going to get, hey, could you play Black Sabbath's War Pigs?  I'd play.  Could you sing War Pigs by Black Sabbath?  So this one guy had to sing that Aerosmith song from Armageddon.  Don't want to miss a thing.  Right.  Not pink? 
[00:42:30]  No, not pink.  Is that Eddie Trunk?  That's the guy?  I know, right?  That's what I was thinking when I saw that.  Oh, Eddie Trunk.  And he didn't want to sing that.  Right.  So then he gets on Twitter, and he starts talking about the listeners and his fans suggesting  other songs.  Because I guess they all get these suggestions from the fans.  They're like, oh, you should do this, you should do this, you should do this.  Right.  And he's like, I don't want to do that.  And, you know, the people are retarded for suggesting these things.  You know, the fans are retarded. 
[00:43:00]  He called them retarded.  And then he dropped it again after Buzz TV did an interview with him, and he dropped  it in audio form.  The R-bomb.  The R-bomb.  Ugh.  But if you are still watching American Idol, you could be retarded.  They're down to the top four?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Who knew, right?  I used to like watching that show.  But it's been many, many years.  I don't know what happened, but...  It's really bad now. 
[00:43:30]  Uh, speaking to AfterBuzz TV last week, what's his name?  Caleb?  Caleb.  Caleb?  Caleb Johnson?  Nice.  Speaking to AfterBuzz TV last week about his opinion of social media, Caleb expressed some  of his lingering resentment over having to perform the fan-requested Aerosmith Ballad, I Don't  Want to Miss a Thing, a song he admitted he hates, and arguably his weakest performance  of the season, by blasting his followers, who supposedly regularly spam his Twitter feed  with unwelcome song suggestions. 
[00:44:00]  Right.  You have the audio if you want to.  All right.  Do you like a little audio?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's hear Caleb.  Caleb Johnson.  Oh, Caleb Johnson.  The next one's from Wendy King, and she wants to know, has your opinion of social media changed  since being on American Idol?  Yeah.  It gives a...  Next one's from Wendy King.  She wants to know, has your...  My bike tire is running out of air. 
[00:44:30]  That's what it sounds like.  I'm going to have to patch it up before I go for a ride.  Sounds like steam escaping.  Let's start over.  The next one's from Wendy King, and she wants to know, has your opinion of social media changed  since being on American Idol?  Yeah, it gives access to a bunch of retards to talk to me.  And, you know, I don't really enjoy having to see somebody tell me what song I need to 
[00:45:00]  sing.  You know, I think at this point in the competition, I can pick and choose my own songs and represent  me in the best place.  I don't need 10,000 people saying, you should sing this, you should sing that, listen to me,  listen to me.  Fortunately, guys, I'm going to listen to myself, whether you like it or not.  Wow.  Good for him.  A little bit of an attitude.  Good for him.  Fuck it.  Ah, the article goes on to say, to diss his super fans, the people most likely to super  vote for him was foolish enough, but his politically incorrect wording made the situation much, 
[00:45:30]  much worse.  Jesus Christ.  I saw some of the comments that people were writing to his tweet when he tweeted the R-word,  the dreaded R-word, retard.  But he used it properly.  Of course he did.  There's a few ways to use that word.  There's one way to use it.  You're just a fucking, you're a horrible human being.  Exactly.  Or among your friends, you could say stuff like, stop being a retard, or whatever. 
[00:46:00]  I don't know.  Nowadays, you can't use it at all.  Not in any context.  Yeah.  Very evil.  Unless there's flame before it.  Right.  On Saturday afternoon, Caleb addressed this controversy on his Facebook page, but not  on Twitter, posting, for the record, that juvenile comment I made in the interview was  not directed towards my fans, but to the wackos that send hundreds of hate messages a  day to me.  You guys are amazing, and I cannot thank you enough for your support.  Sorry if it offended anybody. 
[00:46:30]  It was the wrong choice of words.  Too late.  Also, I greatly appreciate it when you guys give me song suggestions, but it gets really  overwhelming at the volume it comes in, so please understand.  Rock on.  No, his first comment on the song suggestions, that was the honest one.  He hates it, and he hates when people send them.  You don't say a bunch of retards sending me song suggestions, then go back and go, I  meant to say I really appreciate it.  I really appreciate it.  Sorry, I didn't say that right. 
[00:47:00]  I called you retards, but I meant to say thanks.  Well, the American Idol people got to him and said, look, we've got to do something  here.  You know, we've got to squash this before it gets ugly.  Yeah.  Yeah, before people start talking about the show again.  Right.  And then the retards that he was talking about, they started tweeting back, like, oh, I will  not be voting for you.  I was a huge fan before you said that horrible thing.  Oh, were you?  As a parent of an autistic child, I said, oh, yeah, they all came out of the woodwork 
[00:47:30]  to give him some what of it.  Well, he's, you know, he's being real, though, which is kind of cool.  Rare.  They don't want you to keep it real on American Idol.  I like that.  He's keeping it real.  They want you to keep it family friendly.  Is he going to win this thing?  Are you watching, Sam?  I'm not even watching anymore.  Wow.  I was in there for a long time.  I don't know.  I don't know if this is the ratings on this American Idol.  I mean, they're not great.  They're not, like, horrible.  I don't think they're bad enough because it's a cheap show to make. 
[00:48:00]  So I don't think they're bad enough to cancel it.  Jordan Sparks does well, right?  She does all right.  They made her into some kind of mermaid, and it's on TV every once in a while.  Maybe it's on one of the kid channels.  I don't know.  And I don't even know what it's for, to be honest with you.  I don't know if it's a new animation coming out or not.  Yeah.  But they kind of had a, like, it's a chubby mermaid.  Oh, no.  But it's not too chubby.  But they knew they couldn't make her into a regular mermaid. 
[00:48:30]  Right, right, because she's a little chubby.  And it makes me laugh every time I see it.  Let me see if she's a chubby mermaid.  Is that a chubby mermaid?  Ha, ha, ha.  She's a little chubby mermaid.  But she's not too chubby.  Right.  Because she would be insulted, probably.  Yeah.  If it wasn't an accurate representation of who she is.  But mermaids are a lot thinner than that.  Of course.  Very spelt.  Than that in animations.  They eat fish.  And this damn thing, I don't know why.  Oh, she's got a song called Blue Mermaid?  I didn't even know that. 
[00:49:00]  It's for kids.  Team Umi Zumi?  It's for Nick's hit preschool show, Team Umi Zumi.  Yeah, I watched Team Umi Zumi.  You watched the Team Umi Zumi?  Yeah, you know.  What are you going to do?  But you see the mermaid is just slightly chubby.  It's a thick-ass mermaid.  That mermaid has some hands.  She's a fucking mer-whale.  It's the dumbest...  It's just a subtle thing, but it makes me laugh every time I see it.  Because you know they sat down somewhere and had to discuss this. 
[00:49:30]  They drew one, probably.  George Parks is a little chubby.  I mean, she's in shape chubby, but she's a bit chubby.  And mermaids, traditionally, are much thinner and slight.  So what are we going to do here?  I bet they drew one first and then went like,  Could you...  We like the look, but could you...  Kind of make it a little more hippie?  Right.  Jordan Sparks Mermaid got the fat ass, though.  Got the fat ass.  Well, let's say hi to Craig in good old North Carolina. 
[00:50:00]  Craig.  Craig.  Hey, guys.  Actually, South Carolina.  I moved here a couple years ago from Nova Scotia,  so I keep following the hockey playoffs.  And we actually did have an apology on Saturday via the Boston Bruins front office.  Their GM, Cam Neely, apologized for the racial epithets that were issued after game one by the Bruins fans.  But he didn't do it, though.  What's that?  He's apologizing for the Bruins fans. 
[00:50:30]  For the fans that made hashtag racist tweets?  It's rough when your team loses.  And you're not thinking clearly when your team loses.  No.  And you do some crazy-ass things.  Yeah, but you don't do something that crazy.  Like, the Yankees are seeing his own loss where I start screaming,  Boo to the Jews!  Damn spics!  Like, you know, you don't yell that when your team loses.  It's just a dick move.  I was just joking, though.  I was not serious.  I was only joking. 
[00:51:00]  Classless views upset Bruins Prez.  As Boston Bruins president Cam Neely on Friday denounced those who directed racial slurs at PK's...  I always mess up his name.  Subban.  Subban, thank you.  Travis is a Canadiens fan.  Although you told me recently, Travis, you have not been watching a lot of hockey this year.  I didn't watch a lot of the regular season, but we were watching the postseason.  Right, okay.  So what happened?  All right, so he got racial slurs via social media after the defenseman scored in the second overtime  to lift the visiting Canadiens to a 4-3 victory Thursday night in the opener. 
[00:51:30]  Of the semifinal series in the Eastern Conference.  The racist, classless views expressed by an ignorant group of individuals following Thursday's game via digital media  are in no way a reflection of anyone associated with the Bruins organization, Neely said in a statement issued by the team.  Game two is Saturday.  He didn't need to say that.  Does anybody think that the Bruins are behind him?  I know.  That's another unnecessary apology.  Do you really have to clear that up?  I don't think so. 
[00:52:00]  It's pretty pathetic that the N-word was being thrown around just because he scored an important goal.  But then the Bruins themselves are apologizing.  Well, what else is interesting on that note is that his brother, Malcolm, is actually playing for their AHL affiliate.  Right.  So it's going to be interesting when the little brother makes it up to the big team.  And little brother.  Yeah.  Oh, his brother plays for the Bruins farm team.  Oh, absolutely.  Absolutely.  I did not know that. 
[00:52:30]  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good work.  Commissioner Gary Bettman supported the Neely statement on Saturday.  We are about diversity.  You're not about diversity.  You're really not about diversity.  There's three black guys in the league.  Diversity.  What are you talking about?  Thank you.  That is really one place where diversity has no fucking places on any type of sporting field,  whether it's hockey and it being a lot of Canadians and Russians and whatnot. 
[00:53:00]  Eastern Europeans.  Eastern Europeans.  And about ten Americans.  Right.  Right.  And mostly those Americans are from, like, Minnesota, which is almost Canada.  A lot of white guys.  A lot of white guys.  Let's put it that way.  We don't have a lot of guys from Comac, Long Island, and the NHL.  And then you've got basketball.  A lot of black guys.  Right.  So you could say you're diverse, but no, you want to go with the people that are the best  able to do the job.  And that should be universal in any line of work. 
[00:53:30]  In sports, it's so necessary because your team would absolutely play like shit and not  get anywhere if you put diversity in for diversity's sake.  Right.  So Gary Bettman goes, we're about diversity and inclusiveness, he said in the release.  We condemn bias and hatred.  It has no place in our game and is unacceptable.  Unacceptable.  It's very disappointing things were said on Twitter forward. 
[00:54:00]  Brad Marchand said, there's no need at any point in time to be racist.  And obviously no one in this room or the organization feels that way.  And it's very disappointing.  Obviously, we have to apologize for that coming from our fans.  But hopefully there will be no more of that stuff.  So there you go.  There's no diversity in the NHL.  Are you kidding me?  No.  Hells no.  I always find it funny when I go to a hockey game. 
[00:54:30]  I was going to say playoff hockey, but what would I know about that, being an Islanders fan?  But the home team will boo the Canadian National Anthem?  Yeah.  And I always find that hilarious because I'm like, hey, you idiots.  The guys on your team, most of them are from Canada.  And you're insulting where they're from by booing their National Anthem.  They don't care about the people.  They care about that uniform and the fucking name on it and where that team is from.  Bruins.  They'll start chanting USA.  USA.  USA.  It's like, we're Canada. 
[00:55:00]  And their entire team is Canadian.  Right.  I would say the majority of the Bruins are from Canada.  Yeah.  And you're sitting there in Boston booing their National Anthem because they're playing for the Canadians, technically.  Who are playing your Bruins.  I always found that hilarious.  I wonder how the players feel about that.  Yeah.  They've got to understand.  People cheer for the uniform.  It's been done before.  People have talked about it.  Comics have done great bits on it and stuff.  But you're not cheering for the team.  Most people don't even know where the fuck their team is from. 
[00:55:30]  Right.  They just know that uniform.  Oh, look.  They're all wearing, you know, Rangers jerseys.  Right.  That's who I go for.  So we cheer the American Anthem.  Right.  Because that's New York.  We have to boo them.  Right.  We've got to boo those motherfuckers.  The Canadian Anthem.  And then Keyshawn Johnson is also sort of apologizing.  Oh.  Mm-hmm.  Sort of.  He's basically saying he shouldn't have been arrested.  He was arrested last month following a domestic violence incident with his ex-girlfriend. 
[00:56:00]  Johnson works for the NFL, ESPN, blah, blah, blah.  The injury appears to have been minor and caused accidentally, is what they're now saying.  An accidental domestic violence injury.  Injury.  All right.  So he shouldn't have been arrested.  And his statement is this.  I am pleased that law enforcement acted quickly and that this matter has been fairly resolved,  Johnson said in a statement.  The quick decision results from the fact that I should not have been arrested because no crime was committed.  I did not and would not touch, grab, or strike a woman. 
[00:56:30]  Any woman.  Though Jennifer and I are both pleased that this matter is over, we very much resent the  fact that I was ever arrested in the first place.  That is lawyer speak for what we usually hear, which is, I didn't do nothing.  That's what I usually hear on First 48.  It's the same line.  I did do nothing.  Well, she stopped cooperating.  Oops.  She stopped cooperating.  And so they really had no choice but to move on. 
[00:57:00]  Right, right.  So he says all that, like, I should have never been arrested.  Nothing happened here.  Blah, blah, blah.  So then he goes, I apologize to my friends, family, fans, and colleagues for this matter.  For putting you through this matter.  Uh-huh.  For what is right.  Yeah.  For what?  If you're saying it was some weird accident or whatever and had nothing to do with a  domestic dispute, and you should have never been arrested in the first place, so why  are you apologizing?  What the fuck?  I apologize to my friends, family, fans, and colleagues for this matter. 
[00:57:30]  So that's today's apologies.  I think.  We might have missed one.  Who knows?  There might be more.  I bet he rapped her.  You think?  Yeah, why not?  I just bet he did.  Yeah.  So now we restart the apology clock.  Reboot.  Yes.  There it is.  It's all reset, ticking down to the next useless, insincere, groveling apology to make 
[00:58:00]  up for things that years ago used to just be commonplace, and now it's necessary to have  an apology lest you lose your job, livelihood, family, friends, life, or whatever.  I think we have some apologies brewing.  Some are brewing right now?  Are they cooking?  Somebody say or do something?  Oh, shoot.  I should have wrote it down.  I think there's an apology brewing. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, fuck.  What was it?  One's percolating?  Yeah, something's percolating.  I'll remember in a minute or two.  Speaking of useless.  Hi, who's this?  It's me, Lady Di.  How's everything?  Look, we don't have time for this shit today.  Much too early.  We got Louis C.K. coming in in 10 minutes, so make this quick.  Hi, Guy.  What's the problem?  I want to put an end to this crack rumor, okay?  I do not smoke crack, all right?  I just want to let everybody know, all right, that I don't do that. 
[00:59:00]  This sounds like a certain mayor, doesn't it?  When was the last time you smoked crack?  I told you, a couple of years ago.  It went from three to one to a couple.  No, no, no, no, no.  Actually, it was two years ago.  A whole year.  So it's three, it's one, it's two.  You're like a fatter Rob Ford.  Yes.  What is the difference?  A year.  Two, three years, what's the difference?  A year, yeah.  365 days.  You're a manlier Rob Ford.  No, no, no, no. 
[00:59:30]  I just want to put an end to the rumor.  No, no, no.  I'm not a manlier.  Rob Ford with a bigger penis?  No, no, no.  I don't have a penis.  I want to put an end to the rumor.  Do you understand why the rumors are out there?  Because you said you did smoke crack, which you never told us in all the times we've talked to you.  And then you said it was three years.  And then on the after show, you said it was about a year.  And now you're saying it's two years.  All right, now, what does two or three years matter?  It matters a lot. 
[01:00:00]  All right.  It means you're lying.  That's what it means.  It means you're a liar.  I'm not lying, Anthony.  I'm not lying.  It's my lie.  Dye.  And when you were smoking crack, how often did you do that?  Not really often.  Not really often.  Maybe once, you know, like one day a week or something like that.  No, no, not even that.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  Hold on.  One day a week.  That means you've smoked crack.  Wait, wait.  You smoke crack 52 times a year. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, my God.  Now you guys.  Do you understand why the rumors are out there?  Because you just lie through everything.  Plus you say them.  Right.  And if you're admitting that you used to do it once a week, then that probably means you did it twice a week,  which means you're now you're talking about 100 times a year you're smoking crack.  That is a major problem.  Listen to me.  I don't smoke at all right now.  Yeah, cigarettes.  I smoke cigarettes.  And?  But I don't.  Cigarettes and. 
[01:01:00]  And.  Cigarettes and.  Cigarettes and.  The reefer.  And how did you get off the crack?  I stopped doing it.  Without rehab or anything?  No, I didn't need a rehab to stop that.  No!  Listen to how offended she is at the even mere thought.  She might need rehab to get.  She's already fucking five natty ices deep on a Monday.  And she's insulted that you insinuate she might need rehab to get off crack. 
[01:01:30]  This woman's fucking bizarre.  No, no, no, no, no.  What are you knowing about?  I could.  I could do without that.  I could do without that.  Are you there?  No, wait, wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  You have an addictive personality.  So you're trying to tell us that you're able to stop smoking crack on your own.  One of the most addictive drugs out there.  I did it on my own. 
[01:02:00]  Congratulations.  I bet you still smoke crack, Lady Di.  That's what we're all saying.  We bet you still smoke crack because you have an addictive personality.  Crack is one of the most addictive drugs there are.  You have to rehab off of beers and you couldn't last a day after you got out of rehab early, mind you.  Hold on a second.  Bill, Bill, do I do drugs?  No.  All right, there you go.  He doesn't know anything.  You steal his money.  Right.  What does he know? 
[01:02:30]  Remember when the drug dealer robbed you outside of the chicken place?  When the drug dealer, when you were trying to cop?  He knows.  Bill knows when I took money out of the ATM because I told him.  All right, he knows.  So when was the last time you smoked crack?  I told you two years ago.  Now it's up to two years again.  I bet it.  Which is it?  You said three.  You said about a year.  Now it's two years.  I said three because I was a little bit off.  A little bit off.  So when you said about a year, was that a little off too? 
[01:03:00]  What do you mean about a year?  That was a little off too.  You said about a year on Sam's show after you told us three years.  He then asked you, when was the last time you smoked crack?  And you said about a year.  I have to ask you something.  What is the difference?  I don't do it anymore.  That's it.  She's right.  Would there be a difference if it was yesterday or a year ago or two years ago?  Yes, it would be. 
[01:03:30]  Ah, it would be.  Okay.  So where's the line where it doesn't make a difference anymore?  Two and a half weeks?  No, no, no.  Where's the line?  The last time I did that was two years ago, and I wanted to put an end to the rumor that  I'm still doing it.  Uh-huh.  Well, job well done.  The rumor.  Yeah, I just read it in fucking DMZ.  There's this rumor going around that a rhinoceros is smoking crack.  I haven't even thought of you in two weeks. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, Christ almighty.  The rumor.  No, I'm not a rhinoceros.  How many natty ices are you up to?  This is my second one.  Uh-huh.  It's not even eight in the morning.  And she's lying about it, too.  It's more than two.  Of course.  That's a lie that she just told us.  Yeah.  How many natty ices, really?  This is my second one.  I just told you that.  You're stopping.  Well, you have a problem with the twos and threes, apparently.  And ones.  This is my second one.  And I also learned, I think it was on Sam's show, that you used your dad's money to smoke 
[01:04:30]  crack.  No, no, no.  You got the ring.  No, I didn't.  I heard it.  I'm not making up lies here.  You said that on Sam's show.  This is why no one wants to believe you, because you change your story depending on who you're  talking to.  Did you or did you not get a lot of money from your dad when he died?  And did you or did you not use some of that money to smoke crack?  Opie, wait a minute.  I'm trying to think right now. 
[01:05:00]  I did take money out of an ATM, you know, and whatever I used it for, I used it for.  But I don't know if I used it to smoke crack.  She's constantly on the stand.  I used it to smoke crack.  She's on the stand 24 hours a day.  She's always trying to weasel her way out of something.  It's not that.  Okay, Di, is it possible, is it possible that you use your dad's money to smoke crack?  Is that a possibility?  She's just hoping everyone she talks to is like Bill. 
[01:05:30]  Right, right.  An enabler.  Blind enablers.  Sam.  Yes?  Sam.  Yes?  I was supposed to call you this morning.  Thank you.  And I'm sorry I didn't call you.  He was crying about it all morning.  Right.  No, I just woke up actually about a half hour ago.  And already one nattie eyes down and a second one halfway done.  Oh, God.  Well, that's my coffee of the morning sometimes.  My coffee.  Sometimes.  Sometimes.  Because sometimes I don't call.  All the time, okay?  Because sometimes I don't call it my coffee.  Right.  It's my coffee. 
[01:06:00]  I call my crack smoking my coffee.  Yes.  Okay, Di, is it possible?  You're a liar.  Is it possible, Di, is it possible that you might have used some of your dad's money for crack?  Is that possible?  Because you said you don't know, but is it possible?  No, but I did use it for alcohol, though.  But is it possible for crack?  Where did the crack money come from?  Yeah.  It came from somebody else.  Okay, you said it was your dad before.  Come on.  Who's buying you crack?  Who's buying you crack? 
[01:06:30]  No, no.  Let me tell you something right now.  It was a ponytail.  Fucking ponytail.  No, it was a ponytail.  Ponytail.  No, it was a ponytail.  Right.  It wasn't that kind of money.  Who bought you crack?  Well, what did you do to get the crack?  Right.  I'm trying to think right now.  Yeah.  Trying to make something up right now.  No, no, no, no.  No, I'm not trying to make anything up.  It was a friend of mine.  Okay.  And I hung out in a not-so-nice neighborhood in Elizabeth. 
[01:07:00]  She's doing one of those, what were they called, jumbles or whatever?  A word jumble?  A word jumble?  Trying to pick them out of the fucking Mad Libs.  No, no, no.  What the fuck?  Mad Libs.  Mad Libs.  Thank you, Sam.  Oh, it's a Mad Libs.  She's doing a Mad Lib right now.  Proper noun.  Proper noun.  Ponytail.  It was ponytail.  Let's see.  He had nothing to do with this.  It was a friend of mine, which is a girl.  Some of your dad's money went to crack, though, correct?  Sam, please. 
[01:07:30]  Just say it.  Yes or no.  Stop.  You're fucking hemming and hawing.  Just say it.  You're exhausting.  I would bet money that you couldn't pass a drug test.  Exactly.  Come in and take a drug test tomorrow.  You want me to come in there and take a drug test tomorrow?  How do we do this?  What, do we have to cut off some of that greasy hair of hers and put it in an envelope?  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  You're going to have to cut me along because I don't think Bill's going to pay for my, you  know, for my ride to New York.  She's got to get some money if she's going to take a drug test.  Kenny, how do we do a drug test?  Do we have to cut off some of that greasy hair? 
[01:08:00]  You can buy them in the drugstore.  I don't have greasy hair.  What do you call it, man?  Greasy hair, you smoke crack, you're drunk.  It's amazing what a knack you have for latching on to the most unimportant part of a statement  and running with it.  Right.  I've never heard anyone take such an unimportant thing and go with it.  Yes, I heard about, you know, the hair test.  I already heard about that.  Uh-huh.  Yes, I did.  Yes, I did.  I did, too.  Yes, I did.  Because at Budweiser, that's what they used to do to you. 
[01:08:30]  After you come back from vacation, they take your hair, they cut it to make sure that you  didn't do any kind of drugs while you were on vacation.  I already heard about that.  You weren't allowed to do drugs on vacation when you're working at Budweiser?  Do they understand what their product does to people?  And, you know, we love the Budweiser people, by the way.  They did the hair test on everybody after they came back from vacation.  That's what we were just saying.  We agreed.  I said, why would they do that?  And I will guarantee that Budweiser did not do that with every fucking person that came 
[01:09:00]  back from vacation.  They wanted to get you.  Right.  All right, now you don't believe me again.  So how would they get the hair?  Would they shave your legs or your face or your nipples?  We told you you have to go to the nurse's office and the nurse would cut your hair.  The nurse's office?  They have a nurse's office at Budweiser?  They used to.  They just wanted you out because you probably were sucking at your job. 
[01:09:30]  So they're like, okay, when she gets back from vacation, we'll catch her.  There's no way they're cutting everyone's hair when they get back from vacation.  Yeah, they do.  Didn't it strike you as odd that their nickname for you was Lumbering Oinker?  They did not take Jimmy.  All right, no, no, no.  Listen to me.  No, no, no.  Oh, wow.  That's the tell.  Thank you, Cigars and Scotch.  She writes, whenever she denies something, she says, no, no, no.  No.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  Get me another one, please.  Hopefully it's a bullet.  Yeah. 
[01:10:00]  What is that?  You need another Natty Ice?  Yeah.  So you're going to have three Natty Ices before 8 a.m. on a Monday.  Wow.  Holy fuck.  Well, that's the only thing I'm addicted to, is beer.  And cigarettes.  We can get a drug test in here.  We can?  Yeah, we should do that.  All right.  We can get it any time you want.  Oh, wait, go ahead.  Go ahead.  Lady Di, you know what that liver of yours looks like?  Probably looks like you.  You think she's as disgusting on the inside as she is on the outside? 
[01:10:30]  Precisely.  I have an appointment coming up at the end of this month.  Mm-hmm.  And then I'm going to find out if I need more blood tests or not.  You know.  Right.  What do you need?  The old neck bolts tightened?  Anthony, I don't know.  When was the last time you smoked crack?  I told you, two years ago.  Mm-hmm.  With some of your dad's money, right?  A little bit.  Be honest. 
[01:11:00]  Come on.  You know, wait, wait.  Hold on.  Hold on a second.  Sam, I'm not sure.  Okay.  I took one out of an ATM.  Okay.  Now put a verb in.  Right.  Pronoun.  Right.  Okay.  Lady Di, your father died in 2012, correct?  Yes.  Less than two years ago, correct?  Name a country.  No, it was September of...  Name a country.  Well, okay, September...  I'm doing my Mad Lib.  I'm doing my Lady Di Mad Lib. 
[01:11:30]  No.  Di, September of 2012 was less than two years ago.  You just said it is...  You don't know whether or not you used your dad's money for crack.  You got the money less than two years ago.  Oh, shit.  You just exposed yourself.  You exposed yourself.  You smoked crack less than two years ago.  Yeah.  Well, then, you put two and two together.  Just another lie, though.  It's just another lie.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  No, no.  I'm not lying to you. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, okay.  What do you call it?  I'm not lying to you.  It's talking about having a mixed-up head.  You know, the brain is mixed up.  Crack will do that to you.  Yeah.  Yeah, well...  So, how do you know it's not one year?  How do you know it's not six months ago?  No, no, no.  I know it was two years ago.  How do you know?  Could have been three days ago.  Well, how do you know?  How do I know?  Because I didn't do it, and I spend a lot of time at home these days.  All right.  I'll do a lot count, for Pete's sake. 
[01:12:30]  I think it's tough.  I think it's tougher for her to do crack these days.  No!  I'm not decent over here.  Can you get me one?  What did she say?  I'm not decent over here.  Could you get me?  I mean, she's wearing no ski mask.  She has company?  What kind of company do you got?  The person that lives next door is over here, and I got a sheet over my...  You're naked?  I wish it was over your entire body while you were laying down. 
[01:13:00]  You're naked and drinking beers while the neighbors are in the next room?  No, I am not naked.  She's wearing a diaper.  But where's the sheet?  The sheet's covering up that awfulness?  Yeah.  Huh?  What?  What are you wearing?  Will you get me one right now?  Oh, listen to that.  Oh, my God.  What a cunt.  What are you wearing?  That sounds like my marriage, though.  I'm just wearing underwear and a t-shirt.  Oh, how enchanting tea.  Panties and a baby tea right now. 
[01:13:30]  And I've stained guinea tea.  What are you wearing?  She's dressed like Arthur, the fucking Liza Minnelli's father in Arthur.  Yes.  Yes.  Only not as pretty.  She's wearing one of Bill's wife beaters.  Yes.  Get your own goddamn beer.  Yeah.  She can't.  She's just wearing a baby tea and panties.  Get up and get it yourself.  Tuck that bunt into your fucking undies.  Oh, shut up.  She wants a beer now.  What's she describing?  I'm good.  She wants a fucking beer right now. 
[01:14:00]  Don't fuck with her.  Hey, Ron.  Ron.  Who?  Ron?  She's not wearing any pants.  She's fucking in her underwear and a t-shirt sucking down that ice at an alarming rate.  Why don't you put some fucking sweatpants on, Godzilla?  Just walk out there.  It's 8 a.m.  Sitting on the floor with her legs splayed apart like a four-year-old.  Don't do that.  Don't do that.  You don't wait on me.  What the fuck am I waiting on you for?  I love this.  It's an episode of Cops.  All right.  Thank you. 
[01:14:30]  What?  He's mad that he's waiting on you, Lady Di.  But I can't get up because there's company over here.  They put pants on, you fucking zolch.  Fucking pants on.  You're a monster.  There's company there.  Dress appropriately for fucking...  They're in the room laying there like Gilbert Grape's mom.  She's on her third beer before she puts pants on for the day.  Yeah.  Before she even puts pants on.  While they have company.  While they have company.  Why wouldn't you get dressed properly if you got company over? 
[01:15:00]  Well, first of all, he just knocked on the door when I was on the phone.  Yeah.  Most people go, wait a minute, and they run and get something on.  Yeah.  I'll put something on.  I'll, you know, make myself halfway presentable.  Let me put some pants on.  That's what I'm going to do.  I'm going to put my robe on, okay?  Oh, great.  Breaking news.  That's good.  The monster's going to put a robe on.  What's the deal?  Let a little leg come out the shore.  Oh, well, it's good.  Good to see you came over this morning.  What kind of T-shirt are you wearing?  Oh, God damn it. 
[01:15:30]  Please replay that.  A T-shirt that Marion gave me.  Oh, what a T-shirt.  St. Martin Dutch Caribbean.  One of her cruise T-shirts.  One of her cruise shirts that she no longer fits in.  You take this one, die.  You take this one.  Nice and tight.  Right.  Yeah, nice and tight.  Oh, that's disgusting. 
[01:16:00]  You're belching on the phone.  Oh, I hear that so bad.  So gross.  Although it's perfect for her to get one of Marion's shirts.  Marion's tits probably stretched out right where her belly has to go.  Works out perfectly.  Those saggers.  Be careful.  You're going to have to deal with that tough guy.  I know.  The man.  Hey, when is the next time Colin Quinn's going to be here?  Oh, shut up.  Colin Quinn.  The love of your life right there.  He's probably fantasizing about you and your panties burping and sucking down another Matty 
[01:16:30]  Ice.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  He's not.  Oh, okay.  Really?  He's not?  I thought he was.  I saw pictures of him with really nice looking girls.  I don't think he's fantasizing about me.  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay.  Set me straight.  Yeah, I did.  Yeah, I did.  You know, I check out Twitter all the time.  We have this clip of you being very enchanting on the show a few minutes ago.  Oh, let's hear that.  Let's hear it.  Shut up, ladies.  What kind of t-shirt are you wearing?  Oh, she's giggling like a fucking touched schoolgirl, right? 
[01:17:00]  Yes.  Like she's in love schoolgirls.  Like a bunch of schoolgirls.  I'm so sorry about that.  Don't be.  It's one of the most entertaining things you've said.  I just burp like that.  All right.  I'm putting on my t-shirt right now.  My t-shirt.  I'm wearing my robe right now.  Hold on.  Can you hold on?  No.  We're going to go.  We've got Louie coming.  We're going to go. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah, what do you think?  We probably could get a break in before Louie.  Yeah.  Hold on a second.  You got to get, you know, tell us the truth about this crack smoking.  Yeah, you're lying.  I told you.  I already told you about that.  You've told us three different answers.  Two years ago.  My God, Bill, what was the last time I was with Lisa?  Oh.  Huh?  You should have stayed there.  Huh?  You should have stayed there.  I should have stayed there.  He said I should have stayed with her. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah, he loves having you around.  Yeah, Bill definitely likes having you around for whatever reason.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  You put your pants on yet?  You waste.  Are you there?  Okay.  We're going.  She can't put her pants on because they're on fire.  I'm putting my robe on.  Oh, you're a liar.  Pants on fire.  I'm not lying to you.  Oh, you're putting your...  Yeah, of course not.  That's it.  That was two years ago.  Uh-huh.  And the last time I even saw that girl anyway. 
[01:18:30]  Right.  All right, can we go now?  No, seriously.  I think we're done with you.  Oh.  For the day.  Hey, listen.  I love you guys, and let me tell you something right now.  Let me tell you something right now.  I would not mind doing the intern thing again.  I bet.  That was a bit.  I bet.  So you could buy more drugs and fucking beers and...  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I didn't say I was going to do it for money.  Oh, yeah?  For nothing.  I would have done it for nothing.  Wow.  We got a break.  Yeah, we're going to break. 
[01:19:00]  Bye-bye, guys.  Bye.  Lady Di trying to squash the rumors that she doesn't smoke crack.  I think that was successful.  Yeah.  Her squashing the rumors.  You squash anything.  My rumors mean buildings.  What a slob, though.  Sitting around in her panties and an old t-shirt while they had a company over.  Drinking and burping.  At eight in the morning.  She's three beers in already on a Monday.  She's more of a disaster than I ever could have imagined years ago.  All right, look, Louie just will be here in a few minutes.  So let's take a break. 
[01:19:30]  Louie C.K. next.  Yeah, yeah.  Very happy to say Louie C.K. is in studio.  Season four tonight on FX, starting at 10 o'clock.  Two episodes every Monday night for the next seven weeks, I believe, right?  Seven weeks, 14 episodes.  And we just talked about all the episodes because we were lucky enough to see the first four.  We were privy to the first four, which is great before it airs.  But then after it airs, you're like, no, I can't watch for like four fucking episodes.  Well, it's only two weeks.  That's true, yes.  And after that, the first four are more like the other seasons. 
[01:20:00]  They're like single stories.  Right.  But the first, the fourth episode with the elevator lady.  Yes.  The elevator lady and then the young woman.  Right.  They stay.  That's Ellen Burstyn.  Uh-huh, yeah.  And Esther Belint, who's, I don't know if you ever saw Stranger Than Paradise.  Remember that Jim Jarmusch movie?  Oh, man.  No, I didn't see that one.  I've never seen any of his movies.  You know who was a fan?  We're not that cool.  I'm sorry. 
[01:20:30]  Goddamn Charles Grodin.  He's great, right?  Holy shit.  He's in four episodes.  So anyway, I knew that the fourth episode is the beginning of a six-episode story.  Oh, okay.  Great, yes.  And then after that, there's a two-episode story and then another two.  So all the rest are connected.  You know what makes Charles Grodin so brilliant?  He's just hanging out, eating his sandwich.  Yeah.  And as a viewer, I'm like, eat the fucking sandwich and get acting.  But he took his time.  Oh, he made a whole thing of it. 
[01:21:00]  He just was taking his time before he was going to acknowledge and talk to Louis about what was going on in that scene.  But the brilliance of that, to just make eating a sandwich so...  Well, it was written that way.  I mean, he definitely wouldn't have taken it upon himself.  Just take that long.  Yeah.  And I certainly would have cut it if he just did it.  I would have been like, what's he doing?  That's funny.  I eat the sandwich.  He's a really great guy.  He's very funny.  Yeah.  I loved having him around.  It was actually hard to shoot with him because it was so fun to talk to him. 
[01:21:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So I had to have the AD kind of...  You know, I told him, just don't...  Because they were all very reverential.  Of course.  Just tell me when we have to work again.  Because he's got a million great stories.  I bet.  Yeah.  He's a great guy.  That and another...  There were so many fucking just hilarious moments in the four episodes that I watched.  The poker scene with the gym.  Yeah.  With all the guys again.  And that goddamn joke with the guy at the elevator, the construction worker.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The Pinocchio.  Was that hilariously like... 
[01:22:00]  No, that's not the joke.  I fucking loved it.  I know that guy.  I've worked with him.  You are that guy.  I am that guy.  And there's so many moments like that.  Like, the whole storyline, obviously, of each episode is very well written and very  fun and just so natural.  But then there's these moments of just hilarious little parts that are in there.  I can't tell you how much... 
[01:22:30]  I thought, as far as just seeing four episodes at the beginning of the season, I thought  it looks like this is one of the best seasons.  I think it's my favorite one, maybe.  But I don't know.  They're all different things I like about each season.  Hard for you to tell.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I can't think back that well.  But this one feels like...  I mean, we spent much more time on it.  We took a lot...  We shot like 60 days.  Usually, we shoot 40.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Literally, like, whatever that percentage is more.  Whatever it is, that much more. 
[01:23:00]  A third more.  A third more.  Nice work.  That a boy.  You were missed.  Taking the year off, it seems like it was a good thing for you.  Oh, definitely.  Yeah.  Because I just took longer to execute the season.  I took longer to write it and longer to shoot it.  And then editing it was nothing because we were so well shot.  Yeah.  So then it was just assembling it.  Usually, editing takes a long time when you didn't shoot well.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Trying to fix it all.  You got to fix it in the mix.  Yeah.  You got to explain the subway thing again.  The what?  The subway.  I was obsessed with the fact that... 
[01:23:30]  The subway rules?  No, just you filming on a subway train.  How do you get access to one?  Oh, well, you know...  How does that work again?  Because, I mean, as you see it, you're like, oh, my God, I think you got the platform shut  down for an afternoon.  Of course, that didn't happen.  No.  It's hard to shoot in New York City subways.  It's a lot of rigmarole and...  I would guess.  Sorry about that.  It's...  You got to...  You know, they...  Obviously, you need to get a permit and they need to...  The way it works is that there's one train that they let you use. 
[01:24:00]  Right.  It's the shuttle train that all that train does is go from Grand Central to Times Square.  Oh, okay.  The S train.  Right.  The S train has no other route.  It just goes between two stops.  Right.  Oh, shit.  So that's the train they give you.  And they give you those two platforms that you can use.  And you can't shoot until...  Like, you can't start shooting until about 10 o'clock at night.  So they shut down the S train.  Oh, they did?  Yeah.  That's a lot...  That's a way busier one than...  That's a pretty busy one.  Well, that's...  But at that time of night, nobody's much on it. 
[01:24:30]  Who's going over there?  And they only shut down one...  They don't shut down the whole S train service.  It just...  It basically gets cut, like, in half.  They just...  They let us use one.  Yeah.  And then the rest of it, like, we actually asked to use...  This was more ambitious than we've ever done on the subway that we asked to...  We used 103rd Street at Lexington.  Right.  But that was not using the train.  But, you know, you have to go...  Like, we were like, all we're going to do is run around the platform.  And they said, you can't touch a train on those other ones. 
[01:25:00]  You can't go near a train.  I'm like, totally.  And then you get permission based on that.  And then once you have that permission, you go, we just want an actor to get off the train.  We won't put a camera on the train.  We just want an actor to get off the train.  Right.  Yeah.  And then they go, but not on the train.  You can't show an actor to get on the train.  You go, totally.  And then on the day and the moment, you go, look, the train's...  I'm just getting on as a human.  Like, I actually was saying to them, I'm going.  I have a MetroCard.  I'm getting on the train.  Right. 
[01:25:30]  You can't stop me from getting on the train.  So, you try not to burn too many bridges with them each time.  Yeah, yeah.  But it's a pain in the ass.  That's why I wanted to ask you about it, because it seems exhausting.  And you write this really, really good storyline.  And now you have to work around the city's rules.  It's very hard.  New York City is a really hard place to shoot in some aspects.  It's also great, though, because they're used to it everywhere.  And I love it.  It's fun.  You've got to get in shape for it, though.  That was hard.  Up and down those stairs. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah, and all of this stuff.  Just running those kind of shoots is really exhausting.  And that one that, you know, because we have to start shooting at 8 p.m., so we wrapped around 6 in the morning.  Are there regular people just getting on and off the train that you're just kind of filming yourself?  No, they're all extras.  So, we fill that stuff, so it's very expensive.  And when you have that many extras and you're trying to create a random moment, in order to shoot it right, they have to be the same every time.  So, they actually have to tell every fucking person.  Where they randomly should move. 
[01:26:30]  Yes, and then everyone has to reset, and then you have the moment happen again.  I'm amazed.  I have my AD, our assistant director, this guy, Adam Eskitt.  I'm amazed how he's able to do it.  You use, you do the extras thing well.  Like, there's so many movies where they have, oh, the construction work, of course, they dress him in.  It looks like, oh, that guy would be here.  But we had to ask you if that was extras, because they really just blend in well to the scenes.  Yeah, it's important to feel like it's a real place, I think. 
[01:27:00]  And then also to try to get actors to feel like extras a lot of the times, especially people who are supposed to just be some guy, and then they pop out and do something.  Yeah, because I've heard that extras sometimes want to make themselves stand out, so they do something stupid.  Well, no, it's that it's actors.  I wish actors were more like extras.  Some extras are geniuses at seeming totally real.  Right.  Like in the subway thing, I'm not going to give away the story, but at the end of this terrible thing that happens where I'm yelling at my kids and stuff, there's one guy, I kept the shot longer than I should have as far as the timing, but this one guy on the platform did an amazing job of looking at me and kind of shaking his head. 
[01:27:30]  And it was, for him, a very private moment, just going, man, that's fucked up.  Like, you can see, and it was so real.  That guy was just an extra.  He probably got paid, you know, 80 bucks for 12 hours of work.  Wow.  Yeah, yeah.  But some actors, you know, when you're going to talk to somebody, like a construction worker or whatever, the actor looks too acty. 
[01:28:00]  Right, exactly.  You know, it's like if you're watching a movie and the main character goes to buy a newspaper and, oh, Al Pacino runs that newspaper kiosk.  Right, right.  I wonder if that's going to figure in.  I wonder if that's the part.  I remember we did some scene in a bar, and it was so funny.  Some extra just kept trying to move himself to get in the scene, and Louie got annoyed.  He goes, that guy's really annoying me.  And he goes, no, no, just stand over there.  And he put him, like, eight feet out of the camera.  Oh, shit.  That was it for him.  But still make him go stand there and do something. 
[01:28:30]  Right, right.  That's funny.  Yeah.  I remember that, Fricks.  Yeah, he really bugged you.  There was a guy who was just supposed to stand from the waist down.  You're supposed to see him because he's behind somebody who's sitting.  He's supposed to stand there holding a tray, like a waiter tray.  But he held it, like, the way he just stood holding the tray was so, like, he was trying  to throw it like a discus.  It was so awkward.  And I, like, fired him.  I told him to go home. 
[01:29:00]  You've got a great eye for that stuff.  Because you could pick that shit out in other TV shows and movies.  It drives me nuts.  Yeah.  It's supposed to be just dumb background stuff or whatever.  The Seinfeld episode, too, people are going to be talking about.  That was great.  Yeah, yeah, that went really great.  It's hard to talk about these freaking episodes because no one has seen them yet.  I haven't been on TV.  Yeah, you don't want to wreck it.  I could ask you this.  Where did you get the Hamptons house?  That wasn't in the Hamptons, was it?  Yeah, sure it was.  It was.  All that was right on the Hamptons. 
[01:29:30]  And you could just rent a Hamptons house like that?  Well, there's, we have a locations department and they're very good.  Yeah.  Jeff Cairn, the location guy.  They go to places, you know, they go to the area where we want to shoot and they drop  leaflets in people's, you know.  I mean, there's some places that get rented out a lot.  Right, yeah.  I've seen a lot of movies where I'm like, I've shot in that place.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  There's a bunch of places that always get used.  Yeah, that always get used.  They can't wait to have you.  Yeah.  But there's other places that, yeah, you go and approach somebody.  These guys, there's an art to that. 
[01:30:00]  Like going and knocking on somebody's door.  Would you mind if we break at least three things in your house?  How accurate was that as far as Jerry goes?  Jerry?  Did Jerry have to act for that at all?  Jerry?  You know, it's funny.  No, he's such a sweet guy.  He's one of the nicest guys ever.  He never talks to me that way.  No, he's a very nice guy.  Well, when I opened for Jerry back when I was like 18, you know, he was a little rough with me, but he probably should have been. 
[01:30:30]  If I had an 18-year-old comic open for me, I would be reflexively mean to them, I think.  Right, really?  Just, you know, what the fuck do you think you're doing, you know?  But, no, Jerry's a very sweet guy.  And he, I'm actually, I think it was very generous of him to be, you know, he was pretty cold in the thing.  It was.  It was so funny to watch, man.  It just throws me under the bus for the audience.  Oh, yeah, completely.  Thank you.  I like how he gets upset at you because you should have known, like, when you show up. 
[01:31:00]  Well, I'm not sure that came across.  The thing was that it's hilarious.  He's like, Louie, the Hamptons.  Yeah.  Fucking benefit.  Yeah.  And he's like, man, you should have known.  And I look like shit.  And also, the thing, I don't know if it was lost in the audience, is that it was supposed  to be a five o'clock show.  Right, right.  The show starts at five, and I showed up at five.  Right, yeah.  Because, like, under your breath.  It's five.  It's five.  I've got to admit, I stole that a little bit from Goodfellas. 
[01:31:30]  Oh, really?  You remember it when he's like, it's my mother's name.  Yeah.  When he keeps saying it.  Remember the guy who has the car?  Oh, it's my mother's name.  What did I say?  Don't buy anything.  Shit, it's my mother's name.  Don't buy anything.  Then it cools down, and they stop talking, and he's like, it's my mother's name.  What's that?  And he's like, so I did it.  What?  I was being that guy, and I said, what's the matter with you?  It's at five o'clock.  Yeah, it's at five o'clock.  It's at five.  Amazing.  I think people go on the episode, so.  Do you get suggestions on set from people?  Like, hey, how about if I do that? 
[01:32:00]  Or maybe we could do that.  Like Colin rewriting fucking Crocodile Dundee, too?  Because you seem like you would handle that really rather well.  Yeah, you just kind of go, oh, yeah, no, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no.  Yeah, yeah, no, no, no, no.  Yeah, let's go ahead and do what's written.  What I've planned.  Yeah.  I got a great idea.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's hard to not want to be a people pleaser in those moments, just to kind of do what  you've got to do.  It's not hard.  No?  No.  No, I don't have a hard time shutting somebody down. 
[01:32:30]  I really don't.  Like, we came here to do something.  Did that come with a couple of seasons, or were you like, instantly?  Well, I haven't had a lot of people trying to...  Yeah, it's changed shit.  But if somebody's got that kind of gumption, or, you know, that in them, that spirit, that  spunk...  That spirit, you want to crush it?  It only takes a couple...  It takes once or twice.  You just go, no, no, don't do anything different.  But like the guy with the...  And then they lose the...  You've got to have a lot of fucking nerve to go, like, well, I'm going to keep trying.  Right.  Yeah.  Or the guy with the tray, like, just the ability to tell that guy, like, that's... 
[01:33:00]  You're doing that wrong.  Yeah, you're...  Like, I'm such a people-pleasing fruit.  Like, just the fact that you could do that...  That does come with years of experience, because at first, you do, as a director, you want  to be like, I want everybody to be happy here.  I want everybody to say I was the nicest director they ever worked with.  Right.  And you do that a couple times, and you get fucked.  And then you watch the show, it's not what you wanted, and then other people criticize  it, and none of them go...  None of them name the guy with the tray.  And it could have been taken care of.  Yeah.  Right there at the moment.  So after a while, you go, like, I am not...  I don't give a fuck how much anybody likes me. 
[01:33:30]  That's not the important part.  We're getting this right.  And also, there's a kind of instinctive reflex with crews, that they want to say, this is  the greatest show ever, but it's a way to keep you happy, so that you don't push for  much.  Right.  So I've always assumed that we're under the gun, that we're not going to have a good...  You know, that we're going to not do well if we don't try hard.  Yeah.  But also, a good crew, they wanted to do a good show.  Everybody wants to do good work.  Sure.  So I could get a little tough on the set, as far as trying to get it right. 
[01:34:00]  And we all...  I think everybody likes it, though.  And also, I don't keep people late.  I don't do that.  I don't stay until fucking two in the morning.  But you're also...  But they also know you're a nice guy in the end, too.  I don't know if they know that.  Is Louis C.K. difficult to work with?  I don't think he would say that.  That'll be the headline now.  TMZ.  Louis admitted he's very difficult to work for.  Well, we're getting to that point where we've got to tear Louis back down to earth,  right?  That's what we do with our celebrities.  Enough of that.  Enough of that.  Well, now you're in the...  Oh, wow.  That's pretty fucking...  Did you ever think you'd see yourself on the cover of GQ magazine? 
[01:34:30]  No, I really didn't want to be on the cover of GQ magazine.  Oh, no, huh?  That's not me at all.  It's a great shot, though.  It really is.  Yeah, you look rather handsome and uncomfortable.  It's kind of beyond...  It's perfect, right?  Yeah.  Well, I hate doing a photo shoot like that.  I really hate it.  And I've gotten away with covers where I'm in a black t-shirt doing nothing.  Right.  So I've gotten away with that, and now nobody will do that now.  Right.  They need you to do something else.  So GQ said, we'll put him on the cover, but he has to put on something interesting. 
[01:35:00]  He has to do a cover.  Like a real photo shoot.  Right.  And I did it because that's a high-profile cover, and it means I don't have to do a bunch  of little shitty fucking...  Right.  You know, a picture of me and Aziz Ansari looking off balance.  Right.  Or some...  Next to a pool or something.  Yeah.  No, that one's like front and center everywhere.  Yeah.  You walk into a store, you will see that right there.  That was one day with a reporter, one day in the studio, and it covers a lot of ground. 
[01:35:30]  Right.  So it means I don't like doing any of this stuff, so it means I don't have to do a lot  of other stuff.  But it's perfect that I mean this as a compliment.  You didn't sell out to be on the cover of GQ.  That's you.  It is me.  You're being awkward in a really nice tailored suit.  They asked me to wear a spray tan.  They had a spray can of tan.  No, really?  I bring my own makeup person to photo shoots for the opposite reason that most people do.  So I don't have to put any makeup on.  Right.  Most people do it to make sure how great they look.  Right. 
[01:36:00]  But mine is to ward away like, no, he's not going to do this.  He's got a guy, and then...  And who does nothing?  They don't do anything.  She doesn't do anything.  We hang out.  Does she at least carry around some cases?  She's got all the shit laid out, but she does nothing.  That's totally true.  Just touches you with that triangle piece of foam with nothing on it.  Yeah, that's right.  As I shine, maybe.  It looks like she's doing stuff.  Yes, there's nothing on it.  And so the photographer said, we have this spray tan.  She said, 99% of the guys wear this spray tan.  And I said, I am the 1%. 
[01:36:30]  I shouldn't even be on the cover.  And it took a while to say no to it.  Right.  But I just keep saying no with a smile.  No, I will not do it.  Wow.  What was their reasoning for wanting you in a spray tan when you're...  Because it evens out your face, and it would have given me some...  But if you had seen me with a spray tan, you would have been like, oh, fuck you.  Oh, fuck you.  Oh, man.  So it took some doing to look.  And she said to me, they're going to do it anyway, but in post, it's going to look worse.  I was like, all right, let them do it. 
[01:37:00]  They didn't do much.  I'd rather look touched up.  I'm happy if the story is they had to do so much Photoshop to that guy.  That's fine.  But to be like, is he trying to look like a brown tan?  Bronze.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  We're just catching up here at SNL for the second time.  Wow.  That was fun.  And the monologue was amazing.  The monologue was fantastic.  We played the whole thing here.  We loved it.  Thank you.  We loved the monologue. 
[01:37:30]  That was pretty brave, too.  When they asked me to do it, I thought the monologue is the whole thing for me.  Right.  And so I worked really hard on it.  That's probably the hardest I've worked on a set.  Right.  Like how many times I ran it in clubs.  Yeah.  And I tried to run it in places that were bad, you know, because when I go sometimes to  the cellar, I get a lot of goodwill.  Right.  That doesn't help me get the thing right.  And also from the first time I did the monologue, the first thing that I was surprised by when 
[01:38:00]  I did SNL the first time is when I looked at the audience, I'm like, these are not cool  comedy people.  Right.  But they're tourists, you know, they're from the middle of America, which is who I play  to when I'm on the road.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But it's not a New York vibe.  No, no.  So I thought I got to get this set to be foolproof.  My feeling was I might with this.  I didn't want to do a set that pandered to that crowd, but I wanted to have it ready  so that if nobody laughed, I'd still look okay.  Right.  Yeah.  Like I wanted to be good enough at that set that if I got silence, I could still, because 
[01:38:30]  when you're watching somebody bomb on TV, you can only tell by their face if they're  bombing.  You know what I mean?  The laughs are not that big a quotient in the sound mix.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If the guy looks like he's doing all right, you could buy that he's doing okay.  So I went to bad places, like, you know, basement of bars in the Lower East Side.  There's like some stand-up gigs in these places now.  Wow, man.  And I was looking on websites for shitty little stand-up venues. 
[01:39:00]  No shit.  And I did, you know, there was one where there was water just dripping in front of me on stage.  This place down in Orchard Street or something.  I don't know.  Anyway.  Wow, man.  So when I was there, I was like, if they don't like it, it's not going to go by anyway.  Right, right.  But the fucking crowd was good.  You know how many people were happy you came into their place, and now they're hearing  that you picked it because it was a shitty little place?  I shit hole!  Yeah, they're thinking they're happening finally because Louis C.K. walked in.  No, and Lauren really helped me with the monologue, actually, because in Dress, I did 12 minutes. 
[01:39:30]  And I came off of there feeling like that's the greatest set I ever did.  This was Dress Rehearsal.  I was headed for a disastrous, because it's very bad to have a good Dress Rehearsal for  something, and then do the real show.  Anyway, I was so excited, and my manager said, don't let them cut anything.  It's perfect the way it is.  So I went up to the big meeting they have between Dress Rehearsal and the show, and Lauren  said, so you did 12 minutes in the monologue. 
[01:40:00]  How much do you want to do on air?  Oh.  And I said, I want to do 12.  And he goes, you're not doing 12.  Wow.  He said, you could do seven.  And I said, what if I just keep going?  What if I go over?  And he goes, well, then we'll know that you have no discipline or ability to edit yourself.  And he said, this is in front of everybody.  Holy fuck.  And I was like, all right.  No discipline.  Yeah.  And he goes, there are cuts in that monologue.  It was good, but there were stops and starts. 
[01:40:30]  There were places you could cut.  And I was like, fuck you.  You know, I was really mad.  And then later, the timing lady said, we're one minute under for the show.  They figure out the timing.  And I said, well, then I'll do eight, nine minutes.  And Lauren said, hey, calm down.  It's the first time he ever talked to me like that.  Like, calm down.  So I said, I want to see the monologue.  I want to see it from Dress.  Show it to me.  And he goes, go ahead.  Give him a, you know, it was a little tiny bit tense because I was being really defensive.  No shit. 
[01:41:00]  And so I watched the monologue from the Dress and I was like, holy fuck, there is a lot  of cuts in this.  This is not that good.  Like, I was embarrassed.  He saved me from going out there.  Wow, man.  Because there's a bunch of bits that did okay, but I blew them up in my head.  It's the worst case scenario is you do a rehearsal and you're like, I'm the greatest ever.  It's all gold.  And then on air, I would have fucking stunk for too long.  Wow.  So I sat with Michael Shea, who's a comic who writes for the show.  Yeah, he's really funny.  Very funny guy. 
[01:41:30]  And he sat with me to have another critical eye.  It's very weird and embarrassing to ask another comedian, do you think this is funny?  So I knew that was a good test of it.  Well, it brought me back down to the earth that I was on when I was doing the sets, which  is let's expect this not to go well.  And then I left that earth with the dress rehearsal.  I'm the best there ever fucking was if I could do 12 minutes.  And then with Michael Shea, I'm like, please tell me if this is funny.  I don't know if this is funny.  I don't even think I have five.  Yeah, exactly.  I started to think.  I don't think I can have four. 
[01:42:00]  Can you do that joke twice?  Hey, at least Michael had the balls to tell you.  That's hard to tell the biggest comic in the country.  Look, that one you should cut.  I mean, it was really, really helpful.  What time was all this going on?  How close to the actual show?  You know, the dress rehearsal.  Fuck, I think it starts at like 9.  9 or something.  I mean, you don't have a lot of time.  How nerve-wracking.  So they're getting ready.  A couple hours tops.  Yeah, there's a thing.  There's a woman coming on, you know, three minutes to air.  And this is some fucking live air.  And I'm watching the other one.  I'm trying to cut in my head.  You still watch it three minutes before air?  Yeah.  But I was watching it and kind of cutting in my head. 
[01:42:30]  Are you just shitting yourself at this point?  I mean, honestly.  Yeah, but I've been in that position.  Right, right.  So, yeah.  So then when I hit the back of the door that you come out for the monologue, I was like, I think  I'm ready.  I know what I'm not doing.  And we'll just see how it goes.  So that uncertain, nervous energy, you fucking need that to do that kind of thing well.  Right.  If you come out like, hey, I got this.  You're fucked.  So I invested like three weeks of preparation to feel that way. 
[01:43:00]  And I lost it.  And when I almost, I couldn't, you know.  Amazing.  Did it help you to kind of have that shit to go over right before?  Because then you're not focusing, like, you know, you're not just sitting in front of  the mirror going, okay, ten minutes.  That's true.  Okay, nine minutes.  That's true, too.  The more you focus on the actual work and the content, that's the only thing that's going  to save you.  It's thinking about the spectacle.  And I said it, Sam Smith, the musical guest, he had never been on anything.  They found him at South by Southwest, and I asked him before the show, how are you doing? 
[01:43:30]  And he said, I'm shitting myself.  Irish, English guy, I'm shitting myself.  And I said to him what I was thinking, which is, just think about the song.  Just think about why you wrote that song, or what are you singing about?  Don't think about, I'm on TV.  Anytime you're thinking about, I'm on TV, and what could this mean for me, and am I  this good?  Worthless.  Worthless.  Yeah.  All you should be thinking of is, this is what this joke is about, and this  is what this joke is about.  No matter how good you are, you're always going to read Twitter and realize, oh, I'm  a cunt and I suck. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  Exactly.  None of that's going to pay off for you.  None of that's going to help you.  He killed it, too.  You couldn't tell it.  It's Sam.  Yeah, he did a good job.  Yeah, I thought so.  It's nice.  That's fascinating, that behind-the-scenes stuff.  Wow, you're cutting and editing right up to showtime.  Yeah, it just seems that there's less time to panic if you're working.  Right.  Yeah.  Fucking.  That's right.  How many minutes was it in the end?  Eight minutes.  It was eight.  I don't remember it was about God, and it was about, I forget what it was about, but  I remember I watched it and we played it.  It was amazing.  We loved it. 
[01:44:30]  What a ballsy fucking live TV monologue.  Well, you know what I was impressed by was they don't vet your dialogue at all, your monologue.  They said nothing to me about it.  Like, I thought, am I going to have to defend these jokes?  Right, right.  And I actually, the thing about somebody's got to check under the porch, of God's porch  to see if there's a dead lady under it, I thought about doing that only at air, because  I thought if I do it at dress, they might say something, but then I just felt it's not  fair.  They were so nice to me.  Yeah.  So I did it.  Nobody from standards or anything came up to me. 
[01:45:00]  Oh, good for you.  Not a word.  So at dress rehearsal, it's just the exact same show.  Yes.  And is that the case if it's a meltdown or a disaster, they can just air it?  No, it's like almost twice the show.  Oh, okay.  The show at dress rehearsal is so they can choose the sketches and stuff.  They do like, if there's like eight sketches on the show, they do like, I don't know, 15,  Wow.  16 at dress.  Wow.  I probably have the numbers wrong, but they do so they can pick and choose what really  worked. 
[01:45:30]  I think Daryl haven't survived for that many years in that high pressure.  That's a high pressure performing situation.  I love it.  It's my favorite thing.  I love it.  I, especially if it was last time, it's so fucking fun.  You feel so alive for that whole week.  The amount of pressure on you every day and the amount of stuff that goes on.  And it's such a, if you just, your heart's beating all week long.  And they still have those crazy schedules or have they calmed down where everyone stays  up for, well, there are, the writers are up all night, pretty much every night. 
[01:46:00]  And they're punchy.  There's something about being punchy though.  Yeah.  You know, it's good.  It's good for you.  I think.  I mean, these are young, young, sketch writing is a young guys, woman's thing.  So, right.  There are some veterans there.  There's a few veterans.  You get to leave after the week and then they just, another week.  They say, yeah, Monday morning they're there with fucking fans.  They kind of start over and it's, it's week after, that's crazy.  What would it's like to have a douchey guest host?  I'm sure some of the guys that guest hosts aren't nice or comedians who understand humor  that well.  That's got to be really frustrating or difficult. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah.  I'm sure they have no problem telling the new host who the assholes were.  Yeah, you get to find out.  We're like, on the table read day there was this wonderful spread of food.  Yeah.  And they said, and it was from, and it had a little sign on it from Lena Dunham and she  had just hosted.  So she bought everybody dinner for the table read.  Like she sent dinner from a nice restaurant and they said to me, Lena Dunham did this.  And I said, oh, I ain't going to do it.  I'm not sending you dinner.  Yeah, exactly.  Fuck you.  And so I stopped that tradition. 
[01:47:00]  That probably could have been a tradition that would have gone on for years.  Then I did it.  And then the next person said, I'm going to stop it here and save the next Seth Rogen  from having to do it.  Yeah.  Lena Dunham sent us dinner and Louie left a bag of chips and that was it.  Yeah.  For someone to clean up.  Oh, that's funny.  But, and then on the other side of the spectrum, yeah, you get to hear stories about, you know,  Justin Bieber's a fucking giant asshole.  Oh, sure.  Please don't shatter it.  It's a dreamy doll.  Yeah.  We're all surprised by that.  Why was he an asshole?  He's a mean dick.  Really? 
[01:47:30]  You know, whatever.  I'm betraying somebody's trust, but fuck that kid.  Fuck that kid.  There's also the Common Core, a little controversy.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, look out.  I know.  Look out.  But good for Louie, man, because now people are paying attention.  People really are amazing at their defense of something that, first of all, is so new  and has proven imperfections in it.  Everything does.  It's education.  Right.  But they really just want to dig in, and this is the new great thing. 
[01:48:00]  Right.  And as a parent, you are seeing something not so good about them.  Yeah.  And when people get that way, often when you look at their...  Like, I don't mix it up online, and I don't go on Twitter and mix it up with folks, I'm amazed  at people like yourself.  Oh, I will.  I am the worst.  Who will take someone who has four followers and just make them a star. 
[01:48:30]  To me, it's a means to an end.  Right.  I need to get my word out there, but I need someone to ask me why that should be.  But you do it every day here.  Well, I know.  You get your word out.  Yeah.  Oh, I know.  I have a microphone.  I have the world's ear.  Yeah.  By the way, how old is your daughter?  That was her homework.  Nine years old.  I have a 12-year-old and a nine-year-old.  Louis Pritt showed one of the pictures of the question, and I looked at it, and I actually  got the answer, and I was proud of myself.  I'm just realizing she was a kid. 
[01:49:00]  Third grade.  Yeah.  And I felt good about it.  A lot of people write, what's the big deal?  Numbers three.  Answers three.  Answers three.  Give me another one.  You're 35.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're wrong.  Give me another one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They don't get the point.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, it's been a hassle for...  What made me do anything about it was that, you know, at school, they've tried to organize  some, you know, rallies and stuff to get... 
[01:49:30]  It's a real problem for our school.  So the principal, like, wrote letters to the parents saying, please help us to, you know,  get the word out about this.  Right.  Because what happened was there was a principal at a Brooklyn school.  I forget her name or the school, but she said these tests, the English tests, not the  math ones, the ELA test.  She said it's unbelievably over the top.  The answers are unanswerable.  The questions are unanswerable.  And so the people, the standardized testing people and the DOE, the Department of Education, 
[01:50:00]  said, well, she's the only one.  She's the only one who thinks that.  She's an anomaly.  So all the other principals said, no, we all feel this way.  So there was an, there was actually a need to get the word out that it's to have some  unanimity and say it's not one person.  Right.  So, and my daughter, my 12 year old wrote a letter to just on her own.  She's, I asked her, she was writing something.  I said, what are you writing?  She said, I'm writing a letter to the Department of Education about the testing because she  hates it because she wants to learn shit. 
[01:50:30]  She's a devoted student.  So I thought, well, geez, my daughter's fucking doing something.  So I should do something I'm capable of doing, which is just write this one little tweet.  I just was going to write one.  That's all.  But then you put something that inflammatory out there.  Right.  And then people go, they come after you.  So because it was something that meant something, I had to try to clarify it through more tweets  and then put these pages out there and, um, and then defend that. 
[01:51:00]  And it kind of got crazy.  Yes, it does snowball.  Yeah.  You said something like the thing you hate about Twitter is you say something and then  someone responds and then a bunch of people attack them.  The thing you hate about Twitter is exactly what I love about Twitter.  I know.  I know.  Yeah, some guy wrote, some guy wrote, you shouldn't be commenting about this because  you're not an expert.  So, which is a very touchy issue with this whole thing.  Right.  Which is that people that are experts think they should make policy and everyone should  not only accept the policy, but don't, don't even question it. 
[01:51:30]  Right.  Don't even say like, what's so, isn't everything helped by dialogue?  Isn't absolutely everything helped by information?  Like we all must be the thing of which we, of which we do not speak.  Like, you know, this idea that it's this, there's a cloak over, don't shh, quiet.  Right.  Common core is work.  It's trying to work.  Don't say anything about it.  And you being a parent makes you.  Well, I'm the end user.  You're the end user. 
[01:52:00]  Right.  Yes.  Yes.  And, and in a very important way, it's fucking children's education.  Yeah.  And I'm not, I don't have some power to say this has to go.  And I didn't even say this has to go.  I said, we're having, we're struggling.  We're struggling.  So often very young people that don't look like they have kids that have, you know, around  usually 1200 Twitter followers.  Yeah.  Because they have a blog somewhere.  They go, you should, and the guy goes, you should not be talking.  Oh.  Because, and all I wrote back was I have a child, two children in a public school in a 
[01:52:30]  state where testing is an issue.  Right.  So I don't need your permission to comment.  It wasn't even really hitting back.  It's affecting me.  And then there's just this rain of shit, just people going, you're a fucking asshole, you  cocksucker, you fucking suck a bag of dick, fuck you.  And it's embarrassing and it's tough to take.  Yeah.  And your daughter's just frustrated because she really wants to learn and the testing just  gets in the way constantly.  You spend like six months preparing for the thing.  And then the test is three days, it's three days of testing. 
[01:53:00]  Like she's trying to get her to pass the bar exam.  Amazing.  And none of it is teaching her anything.  Nothing's going in.  Right, of course.  What is it?  Like memorization of, you're not really learning anything.  Well, I mean, it's a tricky thing.  Because they changed this, I don't know, I've learned a lot about it enough to know that  I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.  It's very tricky.  It's a very tricky issue.  Yeah.  But I do think it's way out of whack right now.  And it depends on where you are. 
[01:53:30]  Right.  In some states they roll out Common Core.  In other words, they institute, they use the tests that use Common Core language and the  importance of the tests.  Right.  They start young so that a new generation of students is being taught this.  And then it moves with them and every year behind them.  But here in New York, they just adopted Common Core for everybody all at once.  So all of a sudden, kids that are being taught the old way have to pass a test with the new  criteria the next year. 
[01:54:00]  And everybody flunked.  Like, New York State did it very badly because they, you know, were going to.  Right.  And there's people that think more nefarious things are going on.  That Bill Gates and the people who, that Pearson who published the tests wanted Common  Core to fail so that they could step in.  It's obviously a conspiracy.  Yeah, that's the way some people think of it.  I don't think of it that way.  I think I start with the premise that everybody's trying to do their best effort. 
[01:54:30]  But that's not always a good thing either.  Yeah, yeah.  Bill Gates brought education to many countries in Africa and wherever else.  Sure, yeah, yeah.  Places that didn't have any schools.  And he just built schools.  Gave them computers and windows and all that stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  Scumbag.  Yeah, exactly.  He's devoted most of his life to philanthropy.  And so he's gone to countries and given education to whole countries that didn't have any schools.  That's why.  You're like the first person to give a billion dollars to charities. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah, him and Warren Buffett are both, they have this whole thing about, and it's great.  But then I think what, and this is total unsupported conjecture.  It's what I've heard people say.  Is that he wanted to do it here.  But there's already, there are schools here.  Like it's not, it's not a rubble here.  Right, right.  So he's frustrated.  Because in order to affect change in America, you have to go slow and get your hands dirty. 
[01:55:30]  You have to, you know, have to really talk to people that feel like they are entitled to a certain level.  And so the idea was change standardized testing, like all at once, to say, here's what you have to know.  Everybody fails.  And then you can say, the schools aren't working, so I don't.  Now that's, right, right.  I'll come in and save the day.  I got a good idea.  But that's, I don't believe that's true, but I believe there's elements of that in there.  I mean, from working in movies, the first step of, when a movie gets handed in by a director, the first thing they want to say is it's bad, so that they can now help fix it. 
[01:56:00]  But first you have to say something's bad.  Right.  In order to fix it.  So you make a test.  You go, how do you evaluate it?  I'm going to make a test where everybody has to guess what color I'm thinking of, and if they can't do it, they're all flunky.  That's like the worst version of it that I don't believe in.  Right.  But that's how crazy an issue it is.  Some people think that's what's going on, and then Pearson is making a bunch of money by writing tests. 
[01:56:30]  But somebody's always made money writing tests.  How's the homework?  Because my kids are a few years behind yours.  I'm panicking.  How much homework am I going to have to deal with?  Well, homework is a good thing.  I mean, I hope my kids are challenged by school.  I hope homework's hard.  I hope everything they do is harder than what they're capable of.  That's how you get good at shit.  Right.  The idea that homework and tests is supposed to be a way for a kid to feel like they're really smart, then they're going to stay at a fucking stupid, self-congratulatory third-grade level until they're fucking... 
[01:57:00]  I just...  I don't know, man.  It should be really hard.  It should be too hard, and it should be hard as a parent to sit with your kid and get up to their home.  Well, remember, when we were growing up, you were at school all day, you came home, maybe you got an hour to run around, and then you had three hours of homework every night.  Sit there doing your homework.  That just doesn't make sense to me.  Well, why not?  Why doesn't it?  Because they should be learning a lot at school, no?  Why do they have to now continue to work on shit after school? 
[01:57:30]  Because...  I understand a little bit.  Don't get me wrong.  The idea isn't that the teacher's job is to just plug information into the kid's head, and then the kid has to learn how to find the information for themselves.  Homework is more important.  I'm being selfish because I got, you know, my siblings all have...  You just don't want to have to...  No, my siblings all have older kids, and they call me, and they're like, we're doing their fucking homework every night.  Yeah.  We're now part-time teachers, because we have to work them through all this shit.  Well, the thing you should be doing, you shouldn't help them figure it out, but the thing you can do for your kid if you're nice is keep them company while they're having to do it. 
[01:58:00]  It's hard to sit there by yourself, and after a while, the kid is literally laying on her back, looking at the ceiling and moaning.  Right.  She can't fucking do it.  And when it gets that, and I'm trying to make dinner, and she's doing that, and when it gets that bad, I go and sit next to her and just keep going, come on, come on, and maybe read it out loud with her.  And that's how this started, because I'm reading this thing.  I'm like, look, honey, you just have to look at the...  Don't think of the whole big thing here. 
[01:58:30]  Do one problem.  Okay, what does this problem say?  And I read it, and I'm like, what the fuck is this?  That makes no sense.  That makes no...  And I'm like, are they teaching you this?  She goes, no.  They just put it on test prep.  They crunch test prep so you can sort of learn how to answer these questions.  Jesus.  And they're poorly written questions.  They're not intuitive.  They're not empathetic.  In order to teach a third grader, you need to understand how a third grader thinks. 
[01:59:00]  You can't just be some academic somewhere who says, this is a very appropriate pattern of thinking for a young mind.  You have to go, I know a third grader named Evan, and he probably would never fucking get this.  So if you're trying to bring a kid to a new idea, give him a path.  Don't just stick the new idea in some other language and go, if you don't get this, then fuck you and fuck your stupid teacher.  Got it.  Definitely got it.  You know, it's like I always say, you give a man a fish, he eats for a day, you teach a man a fish, he eats forever. 
[01:59:30]  Back to you, Lou.  Yeah.  Hey, did you eat pizza with Diane Sawyer?  Yeah, yeah.  How was that?  At Ben's, right?  Yeah, at Ben's.  Down in the village?  That's where I get my pizza.  Right.  And the opening of...  I liked her.  She's a nice...  I mean, I grew up...  It was Diane Sawyer.  She's one of the relics of my youth.  Yes.  How'd she look up?  I'm sure she wouldn't appreciate that.  She probably would appreciate your phraseology.  It's so nice to meet you. 
[02:00:00]  You're a relic of my youth.  You're a cunt, I remember, from way back.  How'd she look up close?  I used to have a little thing for Diane Sawyer.  She's always a little sexy man.  She's an attractive woman.  She is, right?  Most definitely.  Yeah.  And she's very nice.  I'm sorry, that's boring.  No, that's not at all.  I don't know, I'm just thinking of all the stuff you've seen.  Yeah, she was cool.  Was she like a fan of yours?  I mean, she was...  I don't know, you know, her point in her career, like, they just sort of tell her, there's  this guy, and then she watches three things, and she's like, I got it, I got it. 
[02:00:30]  I don't think...  Oh, there you are.  There's a little taste of the interview right there.  What did she ask you about?  You know, I don't know.  She asked me about doing the show and being a dad and stuff like that.  I don't know.  That shit's embarrassing.  Is it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't like talking about yourself all fucking...  It's so...  How are the kids handling the upswing and the fame?  It's okay.  I mean, they're mostly...  Their experience of it is...  They're proud of me when things happen, you know?  But it's just, hey, kids, I won a Grammy, and it was literally like I got an email saying, 
[02:01:00]  I was making dinner.  Right.  Hey, guys, I won a Grammy!  And then from the other room, that's great, Daddy.  That's it.  That's it.  But are they getting, not harassed, but more questions at school and stuff from there?  I don't think that much, no.  Okay.  I mean, I think mostly they just live in their lives.  When people know you every day in a practical life, they don't, you're not interesting to 
[02:01:30]  them, you're just another person, which is my favorite way to exist.  Yeah.  I don't like being set apart.  Right.  It makes me really uncomfortable.  Like, if I'm at a gate to get on a plane, I just want to be like a bunch of people at  a gate, eating a Carmelo thing and reading the Times.  Right.  But when somebody goes, oh my God, oh shit, can I get a picture with you?  And then everybody in the gate turns and looks at me.  Yeah.  And some people who hadn't noticed me go, oh yeah.  And other people are like, why?  Who is he? 
[02:02:00]  Who is he?  And then that person walks and I go, no, I'm not going to take your picture with you.  So then they also go, God, he seems like kind of an asshole.  And then I'm like, couldn't we involve just in some, you know, I just want to be some dude  at the gate.  Some anonymous guy.  Did anyone give you a shit for that or no?  What?  Has anyone been like confrontational or nasty about that?  Mostly not.  I mean, I get, when people ask me for pictures and I say no, they always look a little surprised.  And then 90% of the people adjust and go, am I right?  But there are people that they walk away and they look really bummed. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah.  And I feel nothing.  What percentage of people that ask you do you actually take a picture with?  Zero.  Zero, right?  Zero.  Okay.  That's what I thought.  Yeah.  There's also other people ask too.  I don't like doing it.  I don't like to live in that moment.  Why should I do something I don't like doing?  That fake smile.  No reason.  Fake camaraderie.  Look.  Yeah.  Come on.  And then a joke about, oh, come on.  You don't know how to use the camera.  That new technology. 
[02:03:00]  I know.  No.  It's all right.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Oh, it's blurry.  Can we take one more?  Yeah.  No.  No, you can't.  No.  Can you take one?  Zero percent.  I like that.  It's down to zero.  Is it because they're bothering you with your kids?  Like you're out with your children and people just...  If I'm with my kids, I'm rude about it.  Yeah.  If I'm with my kids and somebody says, can I get a picture with you?  I just go, no.  No.  No.  If I'm just on the street by myself, no.  Look what I have.  Yeah.  I've actually been with my kids where like if they're getting ahead of me a little, like  as we're walking, I catch up to them for that protection. 
[02:03:30]  They're protecting.  No, it's totally...  Oh, look.  It's Louie.  Let's get a picture.  Oh, it's Louie and his kids.  Let's lay off.  Yeah.  We think the opposite.  We leave here and we kind of just mingle around the building just hoping.  Hey, where's someone with a camera?  Well, I guess I'm going to go home.  I just think it works like radio really loud.  On the radio with you guys.  What do you think, Opie?  What do you think, Anthony?  We're looking around, mingling.  Hey, Opie, good show today. 
[02:04:00]  Thanks, Ed.  And then people are like, well, if they're saying that, it couldn't be those guys.  Oh, that would be nice to get to the WCK point.  Ah, not now.  No.  No, damn you.  What point did it get annoying?  Like, I haven't gotten annoyed by it, but I don't have children and I don't, you know,  I haven't really been asked at awkward times.  But at what point did you go like, fuck, I hate this?  Well, the struggle is that I don't have any...  I have no problem with the person that asks.  I don't think they're doing it. 
[02:04:30]  I think they're being nice.  They're actually being very nice.  Sure, a little support.  But they don't know what it would feel like.  If it was once a day, it would be okay.  But I get asked a few times a day.  And if I did it, I would get asked more.  Because every time you take a picture with somebody, people start coming towards you.  That's just where I'm at right now.  I don't think this is going to last.  This is going to die down.  When we did Lucky Louie, there was like one month, when it went on the air, that it was crazy. 
[02:05:00]  How much people came up to me everywhere I went.  And then it went away.  Like 100% away.  So I know what it feels like to have this and then have it go away to the point of like, wow.  Oh, boy.  I wish someone asked me for a picture.  I wish you didn't take pictures.  I got a picture of me, you, Rick, and Pam Adlon on the last day of shooting.  What a fucking fat pig I looked like.  Oh, man.  And the red eyes, too.  You've never been a fat person.  I'm telling you, it was an awful, it was an awful, awful thing. 
[02:05:30]  Do you, that year you took off between the seasons, does that help you with just having  life experiences to write into the show?  Yeah, I just hung out with my kids and breathed and lived life.  And there was plenty to do.  I did a couple movies, too, there, though.  Did a couple movies.  Those were like, you know, five to eight days of shooting.  Oh, that was it.  Very short shoots.  But I'm just thinking like in between a shorter, in between seasons, you'd be like, oh, I got 
[02:06:00]  to write something.  What happened?  Or this, or this would make a good story.  Is it like, ah, good, I have all this stuff that I lived and that kind of helps?  Or is it just?  A little bit, but mostly it's, yeah, having a more normal, humbling, regular life.  It's not like events that take place.  Right, right.  It's just feeling what life feels like.  Yeah.  And when life feels like making TV shows all the time.  I mean, one of the last stories I did last season was about being on a TV show.  Right. 
[02:06:30]  And that's when you start going, all right, we're starting to make a thing about the  thing we're making about the thing we're making.  Right.  Get the fuck out of this for a little while.  Back off.  I just asked that because it showed in the kind of natural, you're just living your life  feel of the first few episodes.  Yeah, and it's not like, oh, this happened, I have a story.  It's just like, I remember what it's like to just be a dude.  You're cooking dinner for your kids and stuff, and it's goddamn adorable.  Yeah, that's what my usual days are like.  Are you writing down ideas all year, though? 
[02:07:00]  Because you said you took some time away from thinking of stand-up and thinking of this.  Are you putting shit down all year?  Like, maybe something later.  Maybe, like, Woody Allen writes a note and he'll throw it in a drawer.  Well, I'll, like, I actually build in, like, there's, like, the month of June, it's worked  out usually each year.  I don't have a single creative thought.  I just, like, avoid it because you've got to rest the muscle or whatever.  But usually around the spring, I write basic, like, just with a, actually with a, just like  a pen and notepad. 
[02:07:30]  Just start writing basic ideas.  So there's a time where...  I start writing scripts, like, in July or so.  If you think of something, will you just go, if it's in that month, will you just go,  fuck it, it'll come back or it won't?  Yeah, I try, and I really try to think.  Wow, you don't write it down?  That's a gamble.  Sometimes, yeah.  You would think you would at least write it down, throw it in a drawer.  You'd think, right?  No, I don't know.  Maybe I'm lying a little bit.  Well, Jimmy was really fast.  I'll write myself an email sometimes.  I'll write myself an email sometimes.  Oh, you do?  Yeah.  Because even if you're not thinking creatively, you just know, like, holy shit, that would so work. 
[02:08:00]  And to let it go away, that's scary to me.  Well, when I'm in that mode, it's because usually I'm pretty burnt, and not much is coming.  So I just don't think that way.  I'm always afraid of losing it, but if you know you have confidence in your writing and  the fact that ideas are going to be there and you're going to create, it takes some of  that pressure off to write every single moment down.  I mean, I don't have a rain of ideas coming all the time.  It's like, you know, a really good idea comes, like, once every three months or something.  Right.  Like, something great.  So, yeah, slow.  I'm amazed at how fast the turnaround, and, like, I think something's a good idea, and the next 
[02:08:30]  day I look at it, and I just realize what a no-talent hunk of shit I am.  Like, that's the voice.  Like, oh, that sounded great.  Yeah.  No, that's always...  It's faster.  Yeah.  Oh, you're mean.  I mean.  Well, even when an audience slaps at something, and then you think it's good, it must be good,  and then it never gets a laugh again.  And you think, oof, that was so good, and it wasn't, it was shit.  It wasn't.  It was shit.  Now, let me just second-guess everything I do.  Yeah. 
[02:09:00]  And then you need 50 audiences to prove to you that it was bad, because of that one that  laughed at it.  But it was good.  What happened?  The worst is when it used to work, and it doesn't anymore.  It's like, we talked about that it goes into that different part of your brain, and you  are so smart when you said, like, it goes into that, it becomes like a function, like a task  part of your brain instead of a memory part?  Yeah, it becomes a procedure.  I learned that from, at the Museum of Natural History.  They have a brain, and they show you how it works, like a brain that's like, has glowing  parts.  Sure.  And they show you how it works. 
[02:09:30]  And when you're learning something, and you're like, carving these paths in your brain  to learn how to do something, but once you learn it, it becomes a procedure, which  means it's just a list of things.  Wow.  So you just load, your brain just goes, go to procedure A.  Oof.  It doesn't go like, do this, then that, and then maybe this will work.  That's how it learned it.  Yeah, so jokes become that.  Jokes become like, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  And you can tell a comic who's got to that place, and you can feel it on stage. 
[02:10:00]  Like, I don't even, I'm thinking about everything but this.  Wow.  Like, I'm not even thinking about this.  I'm just doing a joke, now, here's a pause.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  So when it starts to get like that, and jokes start dying.  Right.  I try to re-remember what is this joke about, and tell it again like I never told it.  Like, explain the idea instead of the pattern.  Yeah, get it off of the track.  Yeah, get it off of the whole, right.  The rhythm, and the certain word you said, and then the face you made, and the little spontaneous chuckle that you put in. 
[02:10:30]  Such a brilliant way of explaining it, because there's certain jokes that just didn't feel right.  That's exactly what it was.  Instead of ten different lines, it became one line.  Yeah.  It just became one action.  Oh, yeah.  Exactly.  Wow, man.  How many more years for the show, Lou?  I don't know.  I just finished this one, so it's, whenever I'm done with a year, I'm like, I want to just stop.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I never want to keep doing it.  Right.  But this year felt better.  Right.  It was harder. 
[02:11:00]  We did it.  There's a hurricane in the, we created a hurricane in the winter.  So it was awful.  I remember you telling us about that last time you were in.  I can't wait to see that episode.  That was hard.  But that's coming later in the year.  But I'm working now on Zach Galifianakis.  He's doing a show, a pilot for FX that I'm producing through my company.  Has he said what it's about, or has he not really said it?  I'm writing it with him.  Okay.  So we're shooting it, actually, in a couple of weeks.  He really opened the gates.  That's exciting.  Because Zach is the funniest fucking guy.  He's great.  And you opened up the gates for FX. 
[02:11:30]  Well, Zach didn't need any of me to open it.  No, I know.  But there's other shows coming now, and it all seems because, you know, you pushed that  door open.  I guess.  I don't know.  I don't know what's out there that has anything to do with me.  But, yeah, FX has maybe a little more courage to try some shit.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And what about, like, hanging out and having fun and shit?  Doing much of that?  You know.  He wants to know if you're doing any of that.  Doing much of that. 
[02:12:00]  No, with work, I mean, because people see you.  They see you on TV, on your show, interviews and stuff like that.  It's like you get much time to just fuck around and nothing.  Yeah, I build it into my year, because this is, right now I'm promoting the show.  This was the best year ever because I had time to write it, and then we took so much  longer to shoot it.  And then I edited it, and I'm done.  They're all done.  That's great.  So now I'm promoting it, doing this shit.  Right.  Thanks.  I think May 12th is like my last, well, this is like the high watermark of the promotion. 
[02:12:30]  Of course.  This is the fun stuff, doing you guys.  It's the fucking, you know, some of the other shit is awful.  The local news shows, the morning shows.  I don't do those anymore.  No.  I should be doing them.  Don't do them anymore.  I should be doing them.  You're just taking money out of my own pocket by not wanting to be on those things.  But it'll be over.  I think May 12th I'm doing Jimmy Fallon, and that's it.  And then after that, I'll have the whole, then I block out.  Then I'm aggressively relaxing.  Right.  And I'll take most of the summer, I won't work.  A boating?  I'll go out on the boating. 
[02:13:00]  How is the boat?  Fucking good.  How many repairs in the off-season?  Not bad.  Not too bad.  Okay.  I did the, I didn't do anything.  I had this stuff.  Repainted, re-varnished, and some others.  Got a new tender, new dinginess.  Dinginess, everybody, everyone that has a boat, it's always off-season.  It's like, fucking new engine, god damn, I had to pull the old fucking engine out of it.  And those things just cost tons of money, yeah.  God damn.  So it's all kind of getting, this is my first year with it, too, so I'm doing it. 
[02:13:30]  And it'll be back in the water in like a week or so.  Oh, you're excited.  You've got to be excited about that.  I'm very excited about the whole summer.  Oh, any big trips planned?  Probably go up to, I want to take the boat further up, like maybe to Maine or somewhere this time.  Nice.  So, I'll be doing that and, yeah.  Yeah, it's, yeah, yeah.  And I'm not going to, I don't think I'm going to do any movies this year.  Last summer I ended up using a lot of this summer doing that stuff.  I'm not going to do the movies this time.  I don't like movies.  It's not fun.  It really isn't. 
[02:14:00]  It's fun if the movie's really great and you have a short amount of time there.  Right.  But, like, I've been offered big parts in movies, but it's like a month living in Shreveport, Louisiana or something.  And it's not worth it.  Wow.  It's not worth what I would get out of it.  Wow.  We'll take any movie.  The movie's like the opposite.  I have a job.  Like, I'm gainfully employed.  And then I have a fallback, which is like a going tour.  But a lot of people feel like they have to strike while the iron's hot and do everything. 
[02:14:30]  Like, projects are thrown at them, and it's like, if this dries up, I better let me do this, do that, do that.  And just do everything.  Yes, now you don't have to do that.  And also the amount you'd have to, to me, that I'd have to trade in for that of my real life.  Well, that's just it.  A lot of people will just sacrifice any real life time.  If you're an actor, that's your job.  If you're an actor, you better fucking do that.  Take everything.  Better take every possible part.  Your family better appreciate it and lay off. 
[02:15:00]  Because you have no fucking ability to create anything for yourself.  A comedian actor can just, you know, worst comes to worst, you're back out on the road, doing great.  Many ways to make it happen.  And, yeah, an actor...  An actor is just an empty...  It's like a cup hoping somebody will pour some coffee in you.  There's just no...  There's no fucking...  They just...  Right, right, right.  Whenever you see an actor, like a movie, and the actor's playing this really complex, interesting character, you know? 
[02:15:30]  Like this, some kind of genius, amazing person.  And then you meet them and they're like, yeah, it's pretty cool, it's pretty cool.  And you realize he has no fucking...  Nothing's there.  They just poured the words into him and then he...  You know, they have this wonderful ability to have it come out and feel right.  Yeah.  It's an amazing thing that they can do it, but it doesn't...  They don't keep any of the coolness or the...  It really is amazing when you see somebody do such a good job in a movie and then you sit down to talk to them in an interview or something and it's pulling teeth. 
[02:16:00]  They have nothing.  No, you're not that person.  And perhaps that takes...  It takes that type of person...  It does.  ...to be the empty vessel that can be filled with a whole new personality.  Some people look at it that way.  And I'm being mean.  There's plenty...  I've had friends that are actors.  You're being honest.  But they're...  But it's like being an athlete.  That's the way I think of them.  A lot of actors are like jocks.  And it is amazing when you get like a fucking Michael Jordan to work with who just can really...  And some of them are both, you know?  Right.  This year, Jeremy Renner did like a two-episode arc on the show. 
[02:16:30]  And he's actually a really intelligent, cool guy.  He's a very nice guy, too.  But he's like having like fucking, you know, Derek Jeter on the set.  And jeez, the shit he can do.  He's just so good.  Really?  I think you just realized that you use actors on your show and you had it like this.  I have to be nice to them.  Yeah, no, I don't care.  I can give a shit.  Answer that brilliant explanation.  Wait a minute.  I use actors on my show.  There's no way I'm going to call out Pacino and he's going to say, I heard you on Opie and Anthony.  Right.  True. 
[02:17:00]  I need somebody.  Could you book me a coffee cup so I can fucking...  Yes.  You get me an empty vessel, I guess.  Give me some random empty vessel from your agency.  Yeah.  Send them over.  That's not well...  Well, we were told we had Louie until 9.  It's already 9.  Louie's busy now.  We've got to get him out of here, man.  Fucking great seeing you.  Good to see you guys.  Go get the GQ and check out the 15 Funniest People Live.  You can just flip through it at the newsstand and put it back. 
[02:17:30]  I don't know why you'd buy it.  I don't need to take that home.  Oh, you rule.  What time tonight is it on?  10.  10 o'clock and two episodes.  Two episodes.  10.  So from 10 to 11 every Monday.  Yes.  It's my...  There's one double episode that they're 45 minutes each.  Yeah.  So there's one night that I'm on for 90 minutes.  Very cool.  It's like the week before the finale.  Yeah.  I did this whole flashback episodes and it turned into like a movie basically. 
[02:18:00]  So it's like it's two episodes, but they filled out to a 90 minute.  Did you ask them like, look, I need more time here or did you just...  Yeah, they used to be hard.  It used to be like you fight for a minute over.  But everything's different now for all television.  Like with how much time they take.  Yeah, it doesn't matter anymore for some reason.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So most people don't watch it on the air anyway.  So it doesn't matter.  So I told them these are both...  The actual running time is like 33 minutes each, but with commercials that's 45 minutes.  And they said, yeah, the Sons of Anarchy turns in like twice the amount. 
[02:18:30]  Everybody goes over now.  Okay.  So...  And don't tune in late tonight either because that opening...  Yeah, the first scene of the first show is one of the funniest things that we've done on the show.  And the first part on the street with the garbage men was directed by my assistant director because I was throwing up and I couldn't get to the set.  Wow.  I was vomiting out of my asshole and my mouth.  Oh, wow.  Just water.  And so he...  And they said, look, we'll shoot it because everybody was there and ready. 
[02:19:00]  They said, we'll shoot it with Adam.  And if you don't like it, we can reschedule it.  But as long as everybody's here, let's shoot it.  So they shot it and he fucking nailed it.  And it's great.  Fucking great.  Yes.  I saw you like a week after that and they said you were eating ice cream and you were sick and you were just shitting and puking.  Yeah, I was in bad shape.  It sucks.  Glad you're better.  Thank you, Jim.  Thank you.  I'm glad you're better.  I'm glad you're better.  Let's get him out of here. 
[02:19:30]  All right.  Thanks, man.  Thank you, buddy.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  I want to thank Louis C.K. for stopping by.  Yes.  He doesn't really need to come by here.  No.  You know?  I mean, our audience already knows about the show.  We'll be watching tonight. 
[02:20:00]  I guess.  Very funny.  I guess like we said after the interview when we were just shooting the shit, it's a reminder  to people.  Like, oh, that's right.  Tonight it's time for Louis on FX.  Yeah.  Louis doesn't have to preach to our audience that he's funny or anything.  This is more fun for him, I think, just to come in.  He's just yapping with his friends, you know, as opposed to people who don't know him.  Char.  That was fun.  It's weird, though, because it's like, oh, my God, it's Louis C.K.  It's like, hey, he walks in now, and it's kind of like, hey, look, it's Louis C.K.  It's like, no, it's fucking Louis. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah, we've done.  Don't get like that.  We've probably done 100 hours of radio with the guy.  I know.  I get like, oh, oh, Louis.  I watch him.  I'm such a dick.  But then you realize very quickly that it is just, you know, he's Louis.  He's just an interesting guy.  No matter what he's talking about, he's an interesting person.  He's got a great way of explaining things.  Yeah.  How he explain actors is just so fucking funny.  Empty coffee cup.  Waiting for coffee to be part of it. 
[02:21:00]  It's so funny.  It's so true.  He really is a strange guy in this business, because he actually does care more about the  product he's putting out than all the surroundings of show business.  Um, he, he shuns things that people work towards when they have a TV show.  Right.  You know, like, like the publicity angle of it, the, the red carpet shit, the pictures that,  you know, you like saying things like, oh God, I hate taking pictures.  It's so annoying. 
[02:21:30]  But you know, you certainly love when someone asks and you're like, he's so the opposite  of all that shit.  What I, what I like about him too, is he's comfortable.  Like I asked him about that thing about pushing that extra back or lowering the tray because  he's comfortable being the guy, like on a set.  Yeah.  Like it's, it's interesting to watch him work because he's, he knows what he wants.  And, uh, like, I remember I saw like, I think it was the camera guy who was somewhat lighting  and that's his regular, I guess, camera guy.  He's really good.  Like, but he wanted to do something that Louie kind of didn't want him to do. 
[02:22:00]  And Louie's like, like, was like, no, no, no, this is, this is what I want.  That's it.  And he's completely, uh, unafraid to just say what he wants.  And there's a real basic thing to do, but it's hard to do.  I noticed he's great at it.  I noticed the unbelievably apologetic Jim Norton on set Saturday, whenever you wanted to  ask, who was it?  The director or the assistant director or something?  If it like, like, I'd like to give that guy a line.  Yeah. 
[02:22:30]  And instead of just saying, Hey, why don't you say this?  You're like, it's okay.  You don't mind if I say something.  I'll tell you why I was doing that.  Cause I knew I was allowed to do that because I guess I'm one of the executive producers.  Yes.  It's because it was a respect thing for the director.  Absolutely.  Because Louie directs his own shows.  I'm not, I'm not directing this.  I'm not qualified to direct.  So when you have a director who I respect and I like, and I've worked with before, you  don't want to, I'm working with the guy, but you don't want to come in and go, okay,  but again, if I was a director like Louie, much different ball game, but that's his thing. 
[02:23:00]  He knows what a director should be doing.  I don't.  I understood that, but I didn't know that that was what you should do.  Like, I'm like Jimmy show.  You should be able to just blurt out whoever the fuck is up there, what he wants him to  say.  But you never want to undermine the guy who's because it is like an effort.  And I do respect his opinion a lot.  I would assume though, not everyone does that.  No.  I would assume people will just yell from the back over the director's head and say, this 
[02:23:30]  is what I want.  Well, you know how much Kevin Smith said he hated it.  I mean, this is a much different level of humans, but Kevin Smith said he hated it when  Bruce Willis was doing it.  Bruce Willis was powerful enough in that situation to do what he wants.  He's Bruce Willis.  But I mean, you still, he should have went to Kevin and said, look, is it cool if we,  you know, you keep a person in the process because that's why he's a director.  If I was qualified just to direct shit, then why pay him?  But I'm not.  I've never done it.  You're all yourself, right?  Yeah, I'm not.  It's not my thing.  So, uh, you know.  I just thought it was adorable.  But yeah, I just try to be not a nice old shame. 
[02:24:00]  And I'm new at it.  I'd like to keep doing it.  Seth Rogen was hanging out.  Where was he?  I was walking with Louie.  And then there's Seth Rogen.  I was like, oh, I'm going to see him dropping.  No, but I guess the point, why, we should have just interviewed him today.  So he didn't have to come back tomorrow.  Oh, he's, uh, maybe he's got other things to do tomorrow also here.  Row, row.  Row, row.  And I guess row has food for Cinco de Mayo. 
[02:24:30]  Cinco de Mayo.  Why didn't we have Seth Rogen today?  He's here.  Not a big deal, obviously.  No, he did, um, Howard, that he's doing the morning shows right after.  Howard who?  He had the TV shows.  Yeah, he had TV morning shows.  I think he's coming back tomorrow to do us.  Yeah, he'll be here tomorrow.  His movie I liked a lot.  So we'll talk to Seth Rogen.  Uh, you got food for us?  Yeah, we have an entrepreneur.  People love this.  They love when we eat on the air.  I guess because it's Cinco de Mayo, we have some Mexican fare, do we? 
[02:25:00]  We do, and the guy's also the owner of Morimoto's.  I just ate there.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  This isn't, uh, pedestrian tacos.  No, no, no, no, they're good.  Oh.  No, this guy's the, he owns Morimoto's?  Yeah.  Didn't we last year have, uh, some tacos or something?  Yeah, last year we had tacos.  Oh.  And that lady that we forgot about.  Yeah.  Oh, see now.  That lady.  Yeah.  A hundred bucks to anyone that gets her name.  I remember her.  She was really good.  Those little teeny tacos.  What's her name?  Little teeny tacos.  Where's her restaurant?  Itty Bitty Bitty Bitty Tini. 
[02:25:30]  This is from New York.  Just proving this promotion doesn't work.  Promoting stuff doesn't work.  Well, this guy, he owns Budokan, Morimoto's, so he's pretty sick.  I've been to Budokan in Philly as well.  It's all Philly restaurants?  I want you to want me.  It's live from Budokan.  He runs Budokan in New York?  Yeah.  He owns.  Yeah?  Wow.  This company, yeah.  He owns, like, 33 restaurants.  Oh, my God.  So, the good ones.  Do we get to go to his restaurants for free now? 
[02:26:00]  Well, bring him in, yeah.  What does he got for us?  Let's get the envelopes going.  That was great.  Are you caught up on Game of Thrones?  See you crying.  What?  Are you caught up on Game of Thrones?  No.  How you doing, sir?  There's a guy in there.  I want to know if he's Lee Evans, the comedian.  That's why he's...  Really?  Yeah.  It's a good gig.  Yeah, I don't know if it's him or not, but it looks like him.  You don't have none of that IMDb?  That's a good question.  I reference that, like, all the time.  Hey, man.  I just ate at Morimoto's in Philly. 
[02:26:30]  You did?  Yeah, man.  How was it?  I'm freaking amazing.  It's amazing.  What are you doing in Philly?  I have...  My wife's from there.  I'm down there all the time.  Yeah, what part of the city?  Northeast, actually.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So...  And I've been to Budokan in Philly as well.  Call us when you come down.  Really?  Ah, there you go.  Really?  What is this?  I have, like, 21 restaurants there.  I know you do.  Got to be some kind of alcohol, right?  I got to check out some other restaurants down there.  Time for E-Rock.  We actually try to get into Morimoto a lot because, you know, I'm stupid. 
[02:27:00]  I don't get a reservation.  I'm like, hey, man.  Call us.  The one here, you mean?  Or down there?  Down there.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, because there's one here, too.  Morimoto is amazing.  You guys do the blowfish down there, too, right?  That dangerous blowfish.  It's the money.  It's the blowfish.  If you don't prepare it right, people could die.  But that's got to be a silly little...  Oh, that one?  I've seen that on a Columbo episode.  It's amazing.  But, I mean, come on.  No one's really taking chances with the blowfish.  I've never tried it.  Oh, you're scared?  Are we on the air now?  Yeah. 
[02:27:30]  Oh.  This is what we did.  I didn't know.  Should I put this on?  If you want.  This is the type of show we do.  I swear to you, that's a compliment when people go, are we on the air?  Because we want to make it sound like we're just talking.  No, it's good.  It's good.  What did you bring in today?  We opened a new restaurant here in New York in Battery Park called El Vez.  We have one in Philadelphia, too.  Right.  So we brought some food in.  Wow.  I guess it's guacamole.  El Vez and El Ron or something?  Nice.  El Vez is actually a Mexican Elvis impersonator. 
[02:28:00]  Oh.  Years ago, I heard about...  I was in the music business before I did this restaurant.  And I heard about him, and he was pretty funny.  And we were looking for a name for the restaurant, so we kind of bought his name.  Really?  Yeah.  El Vez.  This could be on the El Vez channel, by the way, this conversation.  They love a good El Vez story.  Well, we'll give them this tape, I'm sure.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They'll do a whole bunch of weekend programming around it.  Yeah.  The big El Vez story.  El Vez.  El Vez.  El Vez.  Okay. 
[02:28:30]  I'll check it out.  Right in Battery Park City.  So, how's the radio business?  It's dying.  We're pretty much the last dinosaurs into the tar pit there.  That's it.  Pretty much.  Years ago, I had my own little talk show.  Really?  On WISP.  Oh, really?  I didn't remember that.  Andy Bloom.  Really?  Andy Bloom, yeah.  You remember him?  You were on K-Rock, right?  We were on YSP.  We were rock stars for YSP.  You were cyrocast. 
[02:29:00]  Yes.  Yeah, with Tim Sabian.  When Sabian was over there.  Who's now kind of working with us again.  I say kind of because, I don't know.  We're not really sure.  He disappears and goes here and there.  Yeah, he's got his own life.  Not that we need a lot of help, so.  Ma'am.  What is this?  I don't know what that is.  I think our PR people brought it in.  I think it's our own lemonade or something.  Oh, nice.  I bet there's tequila in it.  It may be tequila in it, too.  Is there tequila in it?  I bet there is.  Oh, there's tequila in it.  Yeah.  Wow.  Is there tequila in it?  I'll take that home.  It's a little early.  It's just home, yeah. 
[02:29:30]  To be chugging down some alcoholic beverages.  These are really good.  I'm eating some of these little chips.  What's that?  They're very lovely.  Yeah.  Where's Roland?  He usually helps us with the food segments.  What is that one in front of you?  This is the salsa.  That looks real good, but.  I thought they were going to bring some tacos, but I guess they couldn't get it.  They're preparing today for a giant day.  Sure.  Uh-oh.  Because of the Cinco de Mayo thing.  Right.  So we don't get any, like, bowls to put the stuff in, so we can. 
[02:30:00]  Roland, no tacos on Cinco de Mayo day?  Uh-oh.  I like the guy, but where's the tacos?  No, it's called tacos.  Huh?  It wasn't there in the bag.  What?  I saw tacos, but the tacos weren't in the bag.  I have no idea.  What did he say?  Tacos in the bag.  He sounds like Morimoto when Morimoto was talking to us.  The tacos weren't in the bag.  Oh, they weren't in the bag.  What does that mean?  Do we have any bowls or plates or something?  So I could dish some out.  There's a horrible presentation.  That's how I was running to get some.  Oh, okay. 
[02:30:30]  We need a good presentation.  You want to go to salsa and chips?  Yeah.  Plastic containers.  And this is it?  Yeah, because the tacos were in the bag.  They weren't in the bag.  Yeah, I thought they were going to be tacos.  I thought we were going to get a little more.  I think there's a taxi driver right now eating a bunch of tacos.  Yeah.  We're going to just have to have make goods.  So we'll go down to your place for free, of course.  Come today.  Because we're big stars.  And we'll have some tacos.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  What is Cinco de Mayo? 
[02:31:00]  The 5th of May.  That's all it is.  It commemorates.  I don't know what it commemorates.  Huh.  Does anybody know?  No.  It commemorates.  I have no idea.  We did Cinco de Mayo once.  Remember E-Rock's attempt to eat a whole jar of mayonnaise?  Yes, yes, yes.  We did that once for Cinco de Mayo.  Mayo.  Oh, we did Cinco de Mayo. 
[02:31:30]  We called it Mayo, right?  Yeah.  I'm very confused by the fact that there's no tacos today.  I apologize, guys.  There were supposed to be tacos.  There was, right?  Now we just get some tortilla chips.  How's the salsa?  I don't know.  Amazing, right?  I would love to try some, but I don't have anything to pour it out.  Pass it over.  Really good.  Yeah?  Pass it.  I've never wanted Anthony to drop something so badly on his computer.  Oh, my God, right?  And then there's some good guacamole.  There's two kinds, regular, and then there's a kind with pistachios and Greek feta cheese. 
[02:32:00]  How did you get into the restaurant business?  I was in the music business.  I sold my company.  And then set up tons of restaurants that people like?  No, it was by accident.  It has to be.  Know how hard that is to do?  Very hard.  I only wanted to do one thing because I had nothing to do, so I opened a little restaurant.  There was a martini bar.  Where was that?  In Philadelphia, it was called the Continental.  Okay.  And I opened it, and it was a smash.  People were lined up to get in. 
[02:32:30]  It was at a time that people had not been drinking martinis.  Young people weren't drinking martinis way back in the early 90s.  Right.  So this craze happened.  It started in California, I think, and then came here.  And we opened a martini bar with food, and it was huge.  Oh.  And then after that, we just kept on opening stuff.  Wow, good for you.  And we have like 34 here in New York, Philly, Miami.  What's the worst place to deal with to open a place?  Is it New York or Philly?  What's the worst city with bureaucracy?  Atlantic City. 
[02:33:00]  Really?  Atlantic City?  Yeah.  Why?  You want your business by now.  No, it was rough.  Nucky Thompson's got to get a cut of everything.  It's crazy.  Yes.  That Nucky.  It was very tough.  Why?  I don't know.  I think it's, I've got to be careful because I still have restaurants there.  Ah.  I think it's just that, you know, you don't get the smartest and brightest running things  there.  Oh, well.  That's a, and now the place, Atlantic City's in trouble, they're saying.  Yeah. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah.  We're doing okay.  But they're opening casinos everywhere.  Right.  You know, in Philly, all over the place.  Where in AC are you?  We're on the pier at Caesars.  Okay.  Okay.  We have Budokan and Continental there.  Yeah.  That does hurt Atlantic City, like the one in Connecticut and all these other places.  I don't know why every place doesn't just open a casino because it's easy money for the state.  You see my chalky white face?  Watch.  That's all he does.  It's a good face.  Yeah.  It's for radio.  It's, you know, I do facial bits for radio. 
[02:34:00]  I need some of the salsa.  Thank you, Kenny.  Roland's dishing it out.  Yeah.  But can he take it?  I don't know.  That was as good as my regular Joe bomb.  Yes.  That was a great bomb.  Louie just looked at you.  But he made it only when he went.  Yeah.  Roland's very nervous that you're here.  Why?  He told me a ton of, he told me a lot that you were a real big deal.  Well, he's not to mess this up. 
[02:34:30]  He's a foodie.  He's a foodie guy.  Yeah.  He goes to.  They call him foodies.  There's a place in Brooklyn he goes to that I actually kind of have something to do with.  What place?  It's called Fetzal in Williamsburg.  Roland's made a pot he's very proud of.  How long?  Can you say Adobe?  How long is it, there's like a, like where food guys are like rock stars now.  It's really like, I guess that's like the last five or six years where there's all these TV shows dedicated to restaurants and the process of getting food out.  It's like when I started, it wasn't like that.  And now it's become like entertainment. 
[02:35:00]  It's definitely like the next album.  Instead of the next album, it's the next chef and the next restaurant.  What did you do in the music biz?  I was a concert promoter.  Really?  Yeah, big shows.  And primarily in Philadelphia.  I had clubs.  The Centrum?  The Spectrum.  The Spectrum, I mean?  The Spectrum is for the over 65 concert cover.  Yeesh.  That's where they're going to go see Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen at the Centrum.  Oh, okay.  So, yeah, I had clubs and then I sold my company to my competition. 
[02:35:30]  Do you still do this?  Oh, sorry.  No, go, go.  Was that, was the competition Live Nation?  It became Live Nation, but at the time it was called Electric Factory Concerts.  I sold them.  Delsner, Vaughn, and Ruffino are presenting here at the Long Island Arena, Charlie Daniels.  Is that Don Kirchner?  Yes, might as well be.  We played the Electric Factory down there.  Oh, right.  We sold it out, too, for you.  That's awesome.  What years were you, did you have it? 
[02:36:00]  I sold my business in 1993 or 94.  Started it, like, in the 80s.  You know, I did Madonna, the first tour, when she played Philly, the Virgin.  Who?  Madonna.  What the fuck is that?  Excuse me, of course.  Why did you get out of that?  That seemed like it would be more of a fun business to me.  It was more fun.  It was definitely more fun.  But I made money, and it was a hard business to make money, and the bands, and now the bands 
[02:36:30]  get 100% of the gate, as opposed to 95.  You know, I saw Frankie Valli the other day, at the Westbury Music Fair.  He didn't sing a fucking note.  He was performing?  Oh, yeah.  Well, 80 years old.  He wasn't performing.  He wasn't performing, though.  He was standing there, lip-syncing the whole thing, with his finger on the mic button.  And then in between, he'd be like, yeah, people.  Click, click, back off.  Then, you know, the recording would play.  Well, you can't hit those notes when you're 80 or so.  Unless he had helium in between. 
[02:37:00]  Well, that might help.  And then the four seasons looked like they were from one direction.  So it was all young guys.  A bunch of young guys, you know.  I don't like seeing that.  If you're going to lip-sync, do it to a song that you sang when you were, like, 35.  But he sounded like an 80-year-old guy, like, with an 18-year-old voice.  It just looked weird.  Yeah, it was strange.  There was no need to have it be, like, the original recording from the fucking...  It was fun, though.  We got a good chuckle out of it, me and my brother and sister.  Remember him on The Sopranos?  He was good.  Yeah, he was good on that. 
[02:37:30]  And remember, um, I mean, Goodfellas?  Who do you think you are, Frankie Valli?  You're some big shot?  Remember that.  How tired of...  Has Roland been pestering you?  No, no, he's been good.  He's been great.  He's been great.  I want to give him our numbers for...  If he wants to get reservations or...  Well, he'll be there.  He'll be there, huh?  Does he go to your places all the time?  No, I've never met him before.  Really?  No.  This is great that we get the free shit they put on the table before you get to water. 
[02:38:00]  I'm really...  I really like that.  We get the free stuff that's put on the table.  I mean, the sauce is great and all, but...  What, you didn't bring any glasses of water, too?  I hear Nobu is sending over some napkins next week.  I could at least brought the bread.  That's really cool.  Thanks, Roland.  Roland really...  I don't want to think, but he did have...  He had straws sent over a couple weeks ago.  Yeah.  This guy's a real big deal, but...  Right?  You know. 
[02:38:30]  We had tacos, though, so I guess they got left in the car.  Yeah, so, yeah, because it was supposed to be tacos.  Yeah, tacos in a car.  Yeah, tacos in a car.  Oh, fuck off.  Delicioso.  Cab driver's going to have a nice, fun Cinco de Mayo.  Yeah.  Do you get nervous meeting the big food guys?  Of course.  You do?  Because, like, me and my buddies will go to barbecue adventures, like, which is Fat Sal.  It's very delicious, though.  Yeah.  Yeah?  Go there in Brisket Town. 
[02:39:00]  You hit a couple of barbecue joints.  Is that reasonable?  We wouldn't know.  We're eating salsa.  Salsa.  Do you guys go out much?  No.  No.  I do go out.  Penny.  Every so often.  I like a good steakhouse kind of a thing.  You know.  I like a gentleman's meal.  A gentleman's meal.  Exactly.  What would that be?  Oh, you don't want to know.  I don't know.  I opened the door for you on that one.  No, it's nothing.  It's just, you know, nice, clean, good food, because I can't cook.  Penny?  No.  No tacos.  Epic fail. 
[02:39:30]  Wow.  Yeah, huh?  Is he the security guy?  How did you guess?  We don't know who he is.  We're just scared of him, so he hangs around.  You have a lot of security guys walking around.  Not really.  They just, we have a bunch of big mooks walking around.  Yeah.  I don't know what they do.  We have no fans.  It's basically just to keep us from leaving.  Yeah.  So what kind of food would you guys like to have that you can get, that you can't get  in New York?  Is there anything specific? 
[02:40:00]  Well, you know, New York is really the kind of, um, good, solid, local, uh, sushi joint.  Hmm?  You like that?  They're the high-end places that you gotta go find, but.  You just want, like, a good fish.  Good fish.  You know what you can't get in New York, believe it or not?  What's that?  It's hard to get red sauce Italian food in New York.  And tacos, apparently.  Italian-American food, like, that we grew up with, doesn't really exist here.  It does a little bit in Little Italy.  Yeah, right.  But when you think about it, if you wanted to get, I don't know, manicotti or lasagna 
[02:40:30]  or something like that, where do you go?  You can't go.  You're right.  I live on the Upper West.  The Olive Garden is fine.  I live on the Upper West Side.  He makes a great point.  I cannot find just a good, basic red sauce.  Everyone's fucking around with their red sauce.  The Olive Garden brought us some Melba toast and breadsticks one day.  It was fantastic.  And a blooming onion.  No, but I've been looking.  I kill for a blooming onion right now.  Jesus.  This guy owns some of the, this guy owns, like, all the top restaurants in Philly, and we're 
[02:41:00]  eating guacamole.  It is good, though.  I like the guacamole.  It could have been cheese steak.  Uh-huh.  I can't pump it up too much.  It's guacamole in the end.  It's only guacamole.  We can't be honest with each other.  This is what I eat at home.  The stuff I ate at Morimoto was.  I'm too lazy to make dinner.  We should have brought you our goat.  We have goat on the menu.  Would you have eaten that?  I would have tried it, I guess.  Okay.  You know, sir, one o'clock, they're having a guac-off on another radio show if you want 
[02:41:30]  to compete.  A guac-off?  It's your convenience rich.  The ninth annual guac-off.  Wow.  I think really.  I think really.  Yeah.  Yeah.  People from the food channels compete.  Really?  Yeah.  Well, that sounds fantastic.  Our food segment has hit a new low, Ro.  Epic fail.  Really?  This is an epic fail.  This is a pretty big fail.  I was picturing tacos.  Right.  Delicious, right?  What, with some marinated?  Is it marinated meat? 
[02:42:00]  Yes, and quesadillas you could have had.  Oh, my God.  We had fantastic enchiladas.  Is that the promo thing?  I'm uncomfortable.  I don't want to look at it.  Let me see.  Everybody else is doing a guac-off.  Covino and Rich.  Hey, they're guac-off.  They're wearing the Three Amigos thing.  Obviously, they just superimposed their faces on here.  You sure?  I think this came from water.  Did you do a photo shoot?  That's real.  Oh, is it real?  The ninth annual Covino in which Rich Guac-off. 
[02:42:30]  Boo!  Look, free chips and guacamole.  What's that?  Great.  That's exactly what we got.  I don't care!  May 5th, 1 p.m., Sirius XM Fishbowl Studio.  Wow!  They're doing it in the fishbowl.  It's a fishbowl.  For Cinco de Mayo celebration, sample some guacamole  and cast your vote for the winner of the 2014 C&R Guac-off.  Come for the food, fun, and tasty beverages.  Nice.  Let me see that. 
[02:43:00]  There you go.  They did ask me to ask Louis C.K. to come back to be one of the judges.  Oh, wow.  They don't really think Louis is going to judge a guac-off, do they?  I didn't, I just deleted an email as fast as I read it.  You should have asked them on the air.  Well.  When they asked me, they're like, Ashley, we see if I'll judge our walk-off.  I'm like, ugh.  So, all right.  We've got to take a break, I guess, unfortunately.  Oh, come on, right in the middle of this?  My apologies.  I'll make it up to you.  We do?  Well, yeah, we do. 
[02:43:30]  Oh, it's so festive, GH.  It's very festive.  Look, I'm a boring restaurant guy.  You could have Seth Logan in here.  No.  I recognize that.  No, it's not your fault.  It is.  We're just hungry.  Can we tease the fact that we might be eating pumpernickel after the break?  We would like to sit here another half hour if you brought the tacos in.  Trust me.  No problem.  No problem.  I actually love your places.  Thank you very much.  There's a few more on there that I have been to. 
[02:44:00]  My engagement party or something was going to be at one of your joints.  Really?  Yeah, the Ariba, the Araba, the...  Where's the last one?  Ama de Cuba.  But then they wouldn't take same-sex marriage.  I think Bush was still president, though.  Yeah.  Yeah, you know.  This is really good, though, the guacamole.  Thank you very much.  It's guacamole.  It is tasty.  Everyone says how amazing their guacamole is.  It's definitely good guac.  I'm just trying to get in there so maybe I could judge the guac off. 
[02:44:30]  He even knows it's just guac because he put pistachios in his just to mix it up a little bit.  Yeah, we put pistachios in.  And goat cheese.  That's nuts.  Do you do the day-to-day stuff still for the restaurant, or do you just sit back and, you know, roll in the money?  No, I definitely don't cook, but I'm the overseer of everything.  Absolutely.  And I'm enrolling in the money, but I'm also paying back the money at the same time, so it's a lot.  So you have to deal with all the bullshit of, like, cooks quitting on you. 
[02:45:00]  You are very mysterious.  A guy, yeah, line cook, stabbing another line cook.  You've had that?  Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.  We deal with everything.  I'm a silent partner in a restaurant.  Really?  Yeah, my brother kicks ass and does a great job.  F.H. Riley's in the heart of Huntington Village.  He makes a great guacamole, too, and he doesn't even deal with Mexican stuff.  But every once in a while he'll just do it because he knows how to do it.  Right, right.  But the horror stories, man, four o'clock on a Friday, his cook will just quit.  You know, you have all that crazy shit.  All the time. 
[02:45:30]  It happens every minute of the day.  Yeah.  I've run out of things to talk about with you.  The rating system in New York, I would love to know, because they started that in L.A., the ABC.  I'm trying here, but without tacos, I don't know what the fuck we're doing.  And is it reasonable?  Like, what can make you from an A to a B?  Because I don't really.  They come in.  The health department comes in on a Friday night at 830, 800.  Well, Budokan's big.  800 covers that night.  And they'll just walk in with thermometers, and you're kind of screwed. 
[02:46:00]  What do you mean with thermometers?  What are they looking for?  Actually, it's amazing.  They want to know everyone's temperature.  They take the temperature of all the food, you know, as the food's coming up.  And if the temperature's wrong, they'll close you?  Oh, they'll give you points.  Points.  That's why, what is it, per se, it got a bad grade, because, I think, because it was temperatures.  But they come in at the...  What is the temperature supposed to be?  Whatever it is.  If it's like three degrees or two degrees off, you get points.  Oh, that's being a little too picky. 
[02:46:30]  So, it's hard.  And then, you know, you never know, which is fine, when they're coming in.  But when they come in, when you're packed, and the whole thing stops, you can't serve.  Wow.  And they do that on purpose, obviously.  They do it on purpose.  Yeah, they have it out for you for whatever reason.  So, what, you can't serve?  You got to tell everybody to go home?  Well, you serve, but you can't, because they're, like, they're behind the line, checking stuff.  So, everything, all the service sort of stuff.  And every thermometer, every food they hit with that thermometer, you can't serve that now.  You got to redo that.  Oh, really? 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, I think, yeah, we have to throw it away.  So, wink, wink, right?  Yeah.  I understand.  Can they walk in whenever they want and just get access to anything they want?  Whatever they want, they come in.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Like a stopo.  Yep, middle of the night.  Oh, I got something else to tell you.  I went to Budokan in New York for my birthday a few years ago.  Well, happy birthday.  Thank you.  And it was wonderful.  Big party?  No, just a few people.  That's a huge, huge spot, though.  Yeah.  How are you making the number there?  Big.  We're very busy. 
[02:47:30]  It's a giant place.  It's like 295 seats.  But very popular.  We did it.  This guy is very popular.  There's an employee here that wants to take a photo with the chef.  Oh.  Who's that?  Who?  Warren.  Warren, you know this guy?  I was covered down the hall, and Kenny said that if I wanted to take a picture, I could,  so.  Do you know who this is?  If I'm happy, I'll do it.  And for myself.  They're just trying to make the show a little lively because it was dragging me.  No, but just way to go with the bitch.  I was dragging you for a while. 
[02:48:00]  Way to go with the bitch.  He'd be great on a movie set.  Well, according to the director, I'm a police officer.  Hey, we're fucking rolling, idiots.  I'm fucking struggling here.  Freeze!  Well, you don't really have to because there's no bullets in this gun because they gave it  to me in the prop department.  See, Lauren, you're just supposed to come in and say, yes, I'm a big fan.  Right.  I can do it.  Do you sing at all?  No.  Okay.  Not professionally.  Not professionally. 
[02:48:30]  Like karaoke.  The listeners are disappointed that we're not eating tacos, by the way.  They're not happy about it.  Epic fail.  Epic fail.  They had time to make more.  I feel like it's my bachelor party and you guys got me a hooker.  Not because, no, I don't mean that here.  No, no, no.  She didn't even know she was coming here.  This is coming from a man who doesn't bring tacos on Cinco de Mayo.  Oh!  He was referring to Roland. 
[02:49:00]  Really ugly hooker.  Roland, didn't they have enough time to come back with the tacos?  I don't know.  Oh, Roland.  This just flopped.  The whole place downstairs.  Who?  We can go to the pole.  Yeah, we could go there and make believe it's ours.  He calls that pedestrian food.  It's pedestrian food.  It is.  He doesn't go into pedestrian food places.  Well, pedestrians aren't starving.  Right.  You know?  What happened here? 
[02:49:30]  They'll be seeing their pans after they eat that.  They could have another serving of...  Yeah.  Could you bring more chips to the table, please?  The child ate a bowl.  You could have at least made the guac in front of us.  I know.  Because that's always fun.  We totally fucked it up.  My apologies.  Don't come to Elbez.  I rolled down a stroke over there.  He is, and I feel very bad.  The guy comes in and he doesn't realize that I'm bringing this stuff.  I'm selling my company today.  No, we...  You know what?  I love the guacamole, and this sauce is very good. 
[02:50:00]  It is very good.  It is.  I got nothing...  So is Paul Newman's.  I mean, what are you going to do?  Oh, Jesus.  Are you guys better than the place on...  Where's that place I go to across from Lincoln Center?  The massage parlor?  No, no, no, no.  Where's the list...  Ro, where's the list of restaurants again?  Rosa Mexicana is really good.  Are you guys better than that?  Oh, Rosa's all right.  I think we are.  I mean, I think we are.  All kidding aside, he is.  Rosa, we go there.  It's all right. 
[02:50:30]  It's not as great as you'd like to think it is.  Yeah, I'm a police officer.  What?  What?  It's hilarious.  She just walked in with no improv skills whatsoever.  No improv at all.  And Jimmy's like, well, the director told me I'm supposed to be a police officer.  In the middle of a scene?  In the middle of a scene.  That would be ridiculous.  Oh, my God.  I love her.  It's so funny.  I love her.  Oh, yeah.  I've been to a bunch of these places.  In Philadelphia?  Fuck yeah.  Yep.  Oh, wow.  Let's see.  Where's the New York ones? 
[02:51:00]  Now I'm confused.  New York's Budokan Morimoto.  A little place called Cafe Storico.  Storico.  Upper West Side, which is part of the museum.  And then Elves.  And we're doing more here soon.  Cool.  Oh.  So are we heard in Los Angeles, too?  Everywhere in the U.S. and Canada.  Everywhere, right?  Yeah.  Everyone is learning that you didn't bring tacos.  Yeah.  So we're looking in L.A.  We're going to open in L.A.  That's what everyone with a clear view of the sky is saying.  And they're going to learn it for the next 24 hours of the replay. 
[02:51:30]  This is what I would suggest.  That, you know, you go back to the kitchen.  And then you make good, like, in a disgusting way.  Like, just so over the top.  Just all sorts of food comes in here one day.  And then people...  Done deal.  Oh, God.  Done deal.  But it's got to be just so over the top.  Just ridiculous the amount of stuff you send here.  If I wake up tomorrow and there are tacos on the console, I'll know we have a deal.  Just pick up the guacamole, pass it around, and let everybody look at it. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah, Johnny Ola likes guacamole.  Oh, this is too bad.  You got it.  We'll have that done.  You want to say this is way better for us that there are no tacos?  Of course there are no tacos.  At your expense, of course, sir.  Oh, shit.  You forgot the tacos, Fredo.  What do we do?  What do we do for the big part? 
[02:52:30]  Chips and salsa for everybody.  Elves at Battery Park is now open.  Elves at Battery Park is now open.  Cinco de Mayo today.  Mike, you don't walk into a restaurant like Elves and talk to the owner like that.  Elves is open today.  Where is it?  Battery Park.  Battery Park.  Mention Opie and Anthony, and we will not give you any tacos.  Even if you order them.  Right.  Right.  It's a theme.  Right.  Oh, man.  I love it.  And I'll check out a few more places in Philly next time I'm down. 
[02:53:00]  All right.  We'd love to have you guys.  Which one should I check out next in Philly?  That's a good question.  I've done Budokan.  I've done Morimoto.  There's two new ones.  I've done Cuba.  One is called Serpico.  Serpico.  Okay.  And the other one is Il Pettore.  Il Pettore.  Which is Italian.  Serpico is the former chef from Mama Foucault here in New York.  It's very good.  Very good.  Nice.  Very cool.  All right.  So call me.  Will you answer your phone?  Thank you so much, sir.  Yes.  And thanks for having me.  Yes. 
[02:53:30]  It's Stephen Starr, everyone.  Roland, we do good?  Yeah.  You sure?  Yeah.  I just, here's my impression of what happens when you leave.  I said, I didn't know.  We're not going to hear any of the words.  He's going to push through it.  All we're going to hear is it's supposed to be.  I'm struggling to look down.  He's like a three-year-old that broke a lamp.  I thought it was tacos.  I didn't know what happened.  They said tacos to be getting in a bag.  Yeah, they said it was supposed to be coming up.  I'm sorry.  It's all good. 
[02:54:00]  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you very much.  No best.  Thanks.  All right.  Thanks.  Here's our 20th anniversary Opie and Anthony radio gem.  All right.  We got American Idol audio.  The highlight, though, of last night's show was that thing.  That, that, uh, did you notice when he walked out, they started playing the crying game music?  I was laughing so hard.  That was really funny.  The crying game music was playing in the background.  This supposedly was a guy.  That is what a torturous life that must be.  Oh, man.  And I feel sorry for that dude, because it's like, he's not gay. 
[02:54:30]  He's a, he's a girl.  He's a girl.  Who has a penis.  It's just so sad.  A girl with a penis and no tits.  Just.  That's what you are.  Fucking sad and doesn't want to be a girl.  Just a sissy, a third level sissy.  A third level sissy.  Just on the highest, highest level on the sissy meter.  It's just like, it's just like, and just to be tortured like that and just want to express 
[02:55:00]  himself with woman song.  Yeah.  I got this day, man.  Yeah, singing the woman song.  And it's like, and like, you know, guys, it's like how real guys change the lyrics to like  men's, you know, it's raining stuff.  Yeah.  Hallelujah.  It's raining things.  And it's all wet out here.  Tall moon.  Oh.  It's wet out here.  Rough and tough.  It's wet outside. 
[02:55:30]  It's raining things.  Oh.  You got to change the words to this.  Wow.  It's raining stuff.  Let yourself get absolutely.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's raining.  Oh.  Hallelujah.  Woo.  Woo.

Holy shit, this motherfucker's like, queen of the night, I got the stun that you want, my pussy's wet, it's just... 
[02:57:00]  Holy shit, it's raining stuff.  Uh, thank you Nathaniel.  Oh!  Nobody!  Goddamn!  We changed the lyrics, but you know.  I think we got a hit on our hands.  It's raining stuff.  The Opie and Anthony Show is back on SiriusXM. 
[02:57:30]  Best news ever.  All right.  I want to thank, uh, Steven Starr for stopping by.  That's great.  I'm starving.  Right?  I'm starving.  What's next, Roland?  Some fuckin' fortune cookies and a packet of soy sauce?  What are we getting?  What are we getting? 
[02:58:00]  My bad, boys.  My bad.  My bad.  My bad.  When did you realize...  When did you realize it was only guacamole and salsa and chips?  When did you realize?  I saw the other bags on the couch over there and I'm like, oh, he's starting us off nice  here.  Yeah, what happened?  We'll have a couple chips together and...  I ran back and I told the ladies, oh, I'll bring the tacos in and they both looked at each  other and went, oh.  I thought you brought them.  Oh.  They're like, oh no.  They started sweating a lot.  Then I went to run away and go home. 
[02:58:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  They came in and they had no tacos.  Oh.  Or castillas.  Or enchiladas.  Or castillas.  Or enchiladas.  Or, keep going.  Tortas.  It was supposed to be a lot of food.  All of that shit, by the way, is all the same.  It's just different shapes.  Yeah, I know.  They're delicious.  Different flavors.  A burrito is a soft taco.  Come on, let's be real.  No, it's a bigger thing.  More meat, more salsa.  It's all the same stuff.  He's right.  It's all prepared the same way.  You're crazy.  It's delicious. 
[02:59:00]  Get a trout dog.  Ew.  How about a clam witch?  Yo, why are you telling them to get a trout?  You didn't like that, homie?  Shot dog.  Yeah.  Wait, wait.  Someone is demanding that we put them through.  Who's demanding?  I'm not demanding anything.  Why is there...  Hold on a minute.  Why is there a picture with Jenny Hut and Louis C.K.? 
[02:59:30]  It was over two years ago.  Oh, okay.  Over two years ago.  All right.  Wow.  I thought she'd corner him.  And he may...  A couple of redheads having fun.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Yeah, exactly.  Hey, hey, hey.  Wait.  Wait, hold on.  Hold on a second.  We're talking about something else right now.  We're fucking...  Hold on.  You hold on.  You hold on.  Yeah, we'll get back to trophy hunters and how they hurt you.  All right.  All right.  Hold on.  I was going to say hi to Louis C.K.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I know.  Hold on.  I'll get you.  Say hi to Louis.  No, she was... 
[03:00:00]  Hi, Di.  Hi.  Hi.  How's everything?  Oh, I don't know.  I am good.  How are you?  Oh, I'm fine.  That's all you want to say to him?  That's it?  I am absolutely good.  How are you doing?  I am good.  Do you like my show?  Yes, I do.  What part of my show do you like?  You want Comedy Central?  No, I'm on FX.  Oh, on FX. 
[03:00:30]  Oh, my God.  Do we get FX, Bill?  Do we get that?  Oh.  Yeah, I think we do.  I think we do.  It's a cable channel, right?  Yeah, it's my show.  No, no, no, believe me.  Believe me, I heard about you before.  What did you hear about me?  I think you're a very good comedian.  What do you like about my comedy?  I like the way you're raunchy.  I don't curse at all.  You don't have to curse. 
[03:01:00]  Then what is raunchy?  Yeah, what raunchy?  What do you mean?  All right, Ant.  Ant.  What?  Devon, you're asking me a question.  What do you mean raunchy?  Um, you know, just being a regular comedian like that.  You're a cunt.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Louie just called you a cunt.  Are you the fat crack smoker?  Well, you're a big dick, you know that?  Whoa!  You're a cunt.  Wow. 
[03:01:30]  Oh, gee, thank you.  He obviously knows you.  That's very nice.  I mean...  You're a fat crack smoker.  Treat Louie like that.  No, I'm not a fat crack smoker.  Yeah, you're a junkie who shits her pants.  Wait, wait, hold on.  My show is good.  You're a junkie who shits her pants.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Excuse me, who said that?  Jimmy?  Louie CK.  Jimmy's not here right now.  Oh, Jimmy's not there right now.  He had to take a leak.  Jesus.  No, no, no.  We're embarrassed.  We got Louie CK on.  He's one of the funniest guys in the country, and you're embarrassing us in front of him. 
[03:02:00]  Well, what about me?  In front of us, whatever.  Well, you're a cunt.  What about me?  What about me?  It isn't fair.  You know, what do you think?  I...  Anyone?  I poop my pants every day?  Yes.  Yeah.  Baby song.  I heard you shit your pants, cunt.  Louie!  Louie said he heard you shit your pants, cunt.  I have to go in the bedroom.  I have to go in the bedroom.  To do what?  To go fuck yourself with a stick?  Oh!  I love you.  I love you.  I love you.  I love you.  I love you. 
[03:02:30]  Oh!  Louie's raunchy.  Jesus, Louie.  What the fuck?  I have to go into the bedroom.  You're a pig.  I am not a pig.  Bill's a pig.  Bill is not a pig either.  You're a piece of garbage.  My show's good.  You're a piece of garbage.  All right.  Listen to me.  Don't call again, fatso.  How about us two get together and go on a show together?  Why don't you get together with the front of a train?  Wow, Louie.  Oh, Louie.  Oh! 
[03:03:00]  Jesus.  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  Louie.  I am done with those jokes already.  No, you shut up.  That is not even funny.  Yes, it is.  It's on my show.  You're a pig.  Louie's hilarious.  Louie, Louie, listen to me.  Oh, shut up.  I just...  Bill's a pig.  Bill was on the phone with his bank.  Bill's gay.  Louie CK doesn't care that Bill was on the phone with the bank.  Yeah, he's got no money. 
[03:03:30]  He's broke.  Ugh.  Jesus.  Bill is not broke and he never will.  Bill shits in your mouth, pig.  Ugh.  Will you stop calling me a friggin pig?  Yeah, shut up, you goddamn cow.  Get it right, rhinoceros.  What do you think you are?  I'm...  You know who I am.  You're called to talk to me.  You're a pig.  You called to talk to Louie.  Yeah, I called to talk to Louie to tell him that he's a great comedian.  I know I am.  Go vomit in the sink, cunt.  I heard... 
[03:04:00]  I heard all about him.  I heard about you, too.  You're a shitpants vomiter, cunt.  Oh.  Oh, wait a minute.  That was only for two days.  Okay?  Oh, I'm sorry.  So you were only a shitpants vomiter cunt for two days?  Oh, I'm sorry.  We're wrong.  It was only for two days.  Holy shit.  It was only for two days that I had the shits, okay?  Yeah.  And now that it's all out in the open, yeah. 
[03:04:30]  That's it.  Why don't you die?  I'll do a show about a big fucking pig that dies and shits all over herself.  And I'll call it the cunt who shits herself.  That would be a great episode, Louie.  That would be funny.  Oh, my goodness.  That would be really funny.  Yeah.  No.  No, it would not be funny.  We could just use your dead body and we'd just kick it like it's a big piece of shit  in the street.  I guess so.  You know, what else is new? 
[03:05:00]  Yeah.  A good one.  Why don't you admit to Louie that you used to smoke crack?  Yeah.  Just tell me.  Yeah.  Well, didn't you used to smoke crack?  No.  I ain't never smoked crack, you dumb fatso.  Ah, you don't lie.  You make fatso noises.  Shut up.  Don't lie like that because everybody experimented with any kind of drug or anything like that.  No.  I was busy raising a family and being a good person. 
[03:05:30]  You're a pig.  Not everyone.  She thinks everyone just experimented and smoked crack.  Yeah.  I'm a pig.  Yeah, that's right.  There you go.  Why don't you kiss a train?  Louie, you have a couple of kids.  You know, Lady Di's got a son.  I'm active in their lives.  I hope she is.  My son is very good.  My son is a good, he's a straight boy.  What does that mean?  No, I'm serious.  He's 23 years old and he hasn't even been to a bar or anything like that.  Yeah, because when your piggishness is at home, he can just drink it at home with you, you pig. 
[03:06:00]  Hey, listen to me.  My son is a good boy.  Yes, but his mother is a pig.  Louie, oh my God.  Wow, Louie, Jesus.  All right, all right, listen to me.  Listen to me.  My son is a good boy.  Shut up.  Marion's a cunt.  No, she's not.  Marion's a fat cunt.  Wow, Louie, now you're in trouble.  Do not, do not get Marion involved in this. 
[03:06:30]  Okay, get that fat cunt Marion on the phone and we're going to yell at her.  Excuse me.  First of all, she lost a lot of weight.  No, she didn't.  She went from her tits to her neck.  She's a fat cunt.  Jimmy.  Jimmy?  What do you mean, Jimmy?  Stop it.  Wasn't there Jimmy in the studio right now?  Oh, God.  It's Louie.  You're drunk.  You're fucking hammered.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Hold on one second. 
[03:07:00]  Okay, Opie and Anthony, you're still there, right?  No, it's the Opie and Anthony show, but we left.  Right, we left.  What do you think?  Oh, God.  How many Natty Ice?  How many Natty Ice?  Uh, this is my fourth one.  You were on number three at the beginning of the show.  She's such a liar.  You liar.  You lie about everything.  You were lying.  You were on number three at eight in the morning.  I am lying to you guys.  How many guys say that?  You were on...  Why is she on the phone?  You were on number three at fucking seven o'clock this morning. 
[03:07:30]  Okay, so now I have my fourth one.  Let's bring back the guy that doesn't bring food.  Please.  What?  You're lying.  You've had more than four Natty Ice.  Come on.  Okay.  All right.  I had a 30 pack, okay?  There you go.  I wouldn't doubt it.  All right.  So why...  It says it's me again.  Can you put me through?  Why?  Yeah.  What did you need?  Because...  I just wanted to talk to you guys.  We have to get back to our Louis C.K. interview. 
[03:08:00]  Oh, God.  Well, Louis C.K. is talking to me right now, so...  He doesn't want to talk to you.  Aw.  I'm gonna go, guys.  Why not?  Aw, now you made him leave.  I'm gonna go.  Louis's gotta go.  Her and this fat cunt Marion.  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait, hold on.  Well, anyway...  I'm talking...  I'm talking, Piggy.  You guys...  You guys gotta go anyway.  You get off the air at 10.30, right?  We don't want to end with this.  Right. 
[03:08:30]  In our mouth.  Aw.  That's a bad taste.  I'm so sorry, Louis.  Almost like no taco taste.  Right.  Remember that?  Moments ago.  Happy Cinco de Mayo, by the way.  Yeah, happy Pig-o de Mayo to you, too.  Stinko de Drunko.  Yeah, exactly.  You and that fat cunt Marion.  Drinko de Mayo.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Don't get Marion involved.  Marion's a fat pig.

I had to not listen to your show that whole time she was fucking interning because her fucking 
[03:11:30]  voice just makes me want to jump off a goddamn bridge.  My voice?  There's nothing wrong with my voice.  What's wrong with my voice?  You're a talking pig.  You are a fucking pig.  Hey, I didn't ask you, Louie.  I asked the caller, what is wrong with my voice?  You're a pig.  You sound like a fucking pig.  I'm a pig.  You're so annoying.  The slur is nice, by the way.  Sexy.  Yeah.  I actually agree with that. 
[03:12:00]  Alright, let me say hi to Jay in Jersey.  Jay.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  Morning.  I heard that, Jay.  I heard that, Jay.  I heard that, Jay.  I heard that, Jay.  I heard that, Jay.

[03:15:00]  Oh, my God. 
[03:15:30]  Welcome to the show.  Sal, if you're going to pick a line of the day, I mean, for me, line of the day was blah, blah, blah, blah, but you can't pick it from the very end of the show.  No, no, no.  I got to, well, which easy do I got?  Let me go to Josh.  What's up, Josh in D.C.?  Sam Roberts, the voice of SiriusXM.  How's it going?  It is going well, sir.  I got to say, I was one of the first ONA listeners on XM.  I paid for a subscription to listen to ONA. 
[03:16:00]  How terrible is that?  I get it.  How?  Lady Di can't be real anymore.  There's no way anyone is that stupid.  It's impossible.  I don't know.  She escapes further.  Either she's escaping further and further into this character or this is just life.  I think it's life.  What's up, babe?  Do you think she's the greatest improv performer there's ever been?  That's like when people were like, oh, I know that woman that you talked to about the iPhone. 
[03:16:30]  She was just making it up.  Like, if Lady Di or that woman or any of those people were characters, they'd be rich and famous.  They'd have sitcom deals.  I agree, and it's impossible.  But have a terrific afternoon.  All right, buddy.  I'll talk to you later.  You got a line of the day for me, Sal?  Yeah, well, it's kind of a line.  What do you mean?  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  What kind of T-shirt are you wearing? 
[03:17:00]  Did Lady Di's belts just win line of the day?  Yeah.  Oh, what a bizarro show we had today.  Louis C.K. just killing it today.  You know, as to be expected.  But then after Louis comes this Stephen Starr, I believe his name was, the restaurateur. 
[03:17:30]  The guy's worth, like, maybe $100 million.  I mean, he's the owner of half the fancy restaurants that you know of, if you know of any.  And he didn't bring tacos.  And the whole segment was about him and his guac and not having tacos.  Then you have Lady Di back on the phone talking to fake Louis C.K., Nick in Wisconsin.  Hey, Sam.  Love the show.  But, hey, I was just wondering, I wondered if the guy should really be putting Lady Di on the show anymore, 
[03:18:00]  just because you got to think, she's near Death Watch at this point.  And, say, she keels over.  You know somebody's going to find the audio of when was the last time she was on the show.  Well, look, I mean, true, but...  That could be a homeless Charlie situation.  Yeah, I guess, but she's also more likely to find help in front of an audience, right?  Like, if we're making people aware of her situation.  And it's not like we're not trying to give her help.  Dr. Steve has literally had multiple conversations with her at home on her phone. 
[03:18:30]  She just won't take the help.  All right.  Okay, then.  Well, all right.  Then I don't know what to say.  That's the whole thing.  There is no answer to this question.  There is no...  I mean, there's nothing to do.  I think actor Brian Greenberg is stopping by the post show today.  Hopefully, he'll have an answer for this Lady Di thing.  He was in that show on HBO, How to Make it in America, and One Tree Hill. 
[03:19:00]  If there's any teenage girls out there listening.  Sean in North Carolina.  Hey, Sammy Roberts.  What's up, buddy?  Lady Di, that's fat cook.  Okay.  I can't put down that horse piss, Natty I, but she's going to convince us that she quit crack.  Yeah, I mean, there was no doubt about it today.  If there ever was a question about her crack habits, I mean, today made it clear that she is blatantly lying to us at all times. 
[03:19:30]  I don't think there's any explanation.  But this is the thing.  Everybody goes, well, you can't have Lady Di on your show anymore.  You shouldn't have her on anymore.  Louis C.K. was on the show today.  And all anybody wants to talk about is Lady Di.  Somehow, she's figured out a way to be very compelling.  Cameron in Toronto.  Hey, Sam.  What's up, buddy?  I have a line of the day recommendation.  Okay.  Anthony and Opie were talking to the Mexican guy or whatever, taco guy. 
[03:20:00]  And Opie said...  What's the name?  He was a chip guy today.  Yeah.  Opie said, I was going to have my engagement party there.  And then Anthony said, yeah, but then they found out you were having a same-sex marriage.  That segment was full of funny lines.  For me, I love that one.  That was very funny.  But, I mean, for me, all the references to the fact that they were dissatisfied with only chips being here and no tacos.  Sal, how did Roland take that segment?  Roland whispered to me.  He came with me.  I was like, oh, my God.  They don't have any tacos. 
[03:20:30]  They don't have any tacos.  And he started panicking.  And this was before the guys knew.  And I was just like, oh, this is going to be a great segment.  And it was, wasn't it?  Oh, I loved it.  Now, how did Roland, as the segment was going on, after the segment, did you talk to him at all?  Yeah, he was eating chips and guac.  He was just trying to drown in sorrows and chips and guac.  He was good.  He was fine.  I think Jim posted a picture of Roland enjoying his chips on his Twitter.  Did you see that photo?  No, but I will retweet it on the O&A Show Twitter account.  It's not the most flattering of photos. 
[03:21:00]  I don't know why he did that.  Do we have our, yeah, I think we have our guests coming in.  You ready?  Yeah, come on in.  Were you just talking about Lady Di and chips?  Welcome.  Come on in.  We're live on the air, so don't say anything.  We're live.  We're live.  I mean, you're uncensored.  Okay.  Okay. </pre>
