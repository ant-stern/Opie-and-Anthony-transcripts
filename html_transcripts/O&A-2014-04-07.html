<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Opie recounting humorous GPS misadventures during a trip to Philadelphia.  A caller then complained about the show's lengthy intro, prompting sarcastic and profane banter from the hosts.  The conversation shifted to the annoyance of ubiquitous "Let It Go" videos posted by parents online, followed by a discussion of Opie's frustrating new car purchase experience and a news story that misrepresented his comments about a potential revolution. This led to a broader discussion about media misinterpretations and Opie's political stance (or lack thereof).

A listener called to complain about an Apple software update that corrupted his work, sparking a tech-focused segment with multiple callers.  The discussion included complaints about Apple post-Steve Jobs, comparisons between Apple and Samsung phones, and a humorous misunderstanding of the word "icicles" as "bicycles."

The show then transitioned to a discussion about a New York City Cronut shop closure due to a severe mouse infestation, mentioning Roland, a friend potentially connected to the bakery, and a fake Twitter account impersonating him. This led to a wider discussion of rodent infestations in NYC restaurants, health inspection reliability, and speculation about the Cronut shop owner's motivations. The conversation briefly touched upon a Vice documentary about Detroit's scrap metal industry. The segment concluded with a humorous WWE wrestler reference.

A significant portion of the broadcast focused on The Undertaker's WrestleMania loss to Brock Lesnar.  The hosts and callers expressed disbelief, discussing the impact of ending The Undertaker's undefeated streak, with Sam Roberts, a guest in the studio, describing the stunned crowd's reaction firsthand.  They speculated on Vince McMahon's motives, discussed The Undertaker's backstage influence and physical condition, and commented on Mr. T's Hall of Fame speech.  The conversation included further discussion of scrap metal, including anecdotes of theft and accidents,  with Sam Roberts detailing his WrestleMania experience.  The segment also covered other WrestleMania events, Hulk Hogan's role, the "Yes Movement," and Bruce Springsteen's free concert.

The show then tackled a musician's poor Bruce Springsteen cover, described as "horrible," "exquisitely bad," and "terrible," prompting a debate about song choice and performance quality. This was followed by a frame-by-frame analysis of a video showing men being electrocuted, with a lineman caller providing an explanation. The next topic was the firing of a Mozilla CEO for a past political donation, leading to a discussion about boycotts (including one by OKCupid), free market implications, and the complexities of political donations and freedom of speech.  Morgan Spurlock, in studio, then shared anecdotes from his CNN show, "Inside Man," focusing on his experiences with paparazzi and celebrities in Los Angeles, and briefly discussed upcoming episodes on living forever and paying college athletes.

A segment on UFOs followed, including anecdotal accounts of sightings and a discussion on the difficulty of obtaining credible evidence.  Morgan Spurlock again contributed, sharing experiences directing documentaries, including anecdotes about being offered to direct Justin Bieber and Katy Perry films before ultimately directing a One Direction film, and discussing various documentaries such as *Jiro Dreams of Sushi*, *Act of Killing*, and *Brothers Keeper*. A caller challenged the portrayal of student-athletes as impoverished.  The segment concluded with discussion of the death of comedian John Panette, an anecdote about Jim Norton and Mickey Rooney, a detailed, crude description of the low-budget film *Bill*, and several videos of women defecating in public.

The final segment began with a discussion of a viral video showing a woman defecating in a supermarket, leading to discussion of other diarrhea-related viral videos.  A caller, "Lady Di," then called about an "unmasked" show at Caroline's, sparking a humorous exchange about the event, tickets (requiring SiriusXM subscription), and potential conflicts.  The hosts debated whether fans like "Lady Di" should attend. The show concluded with an update on the search for Malaysian Airlines flight MH370, joking about the search efforts,  Opie promoting his new t-shirts, and mentions of the after-show hosts, Dennis Falcone and E-Rock, and their upcoming Caroline's appearances.

[00:03:30]  we deserve a nice long intro sir it's actually one-fourth of the size it should be we're  amazingly special radio personalities who deserve a big long grandiose self-congratulatory open  right it's impressive for sure damn impressive i took your phone call to just show the world that  people are just fucking idiots it's it's fucking stacy keach who gives a fuck if it's long  yeah is that real that's what you're going to complain about today with everything going on in 
[00:04:00]  the world you're going to call a radio show to say their intros too long on the list of things  onions  i was just asking he didn't understand why the pomp and circumstance with a lot of their way to you talk with a range of california turn it's very early  it's very early it's what three four even walked out there man go to the last right i don't know i would of rolled over and gone back to sleep i think i could call a show yeah and ask why their intros too long or catch a few more winked or I could say to myself who gives a fuck i could do that right  Did I do the math right?  I don't know. 
[00:04:30]  I would have rolled over and gone back to sleep.  I think I could call a show and ask why their intro is too long or catch a few more winks.  Or I could say to myself, who gives a fuck?  Right.  I could do that.  Right.  I can maybe get up a little early, maybe make some breakfast or coffee for myself.  Oh, my God.  But he chose to dial the phone and ask why our opening was too long.  He likes a nice short intro.  He does like a short intro.  I ended up in a lot of the Brunswick's yesterday on the way home.  Oh, yeah.  That's where Jim Norton's from.  Oh. 
[00:05:00]  South, north, regular.  Is there a regular Brunswick?  I grew up in mediocre Brunswick.  There was north, there was east, south.  There's no, and no, there's no west.  Wow.  Oh.  With a little movie called Frozen playing for the hundredth time.  Oh, my God.  The number one animated feature ever.  Let it go.  I know.  Are you sick of that movie?  Let it go.  Oh, God, am I sick of it.  God.  God.  Apparently, people on Facebook think it's great to have, like, video of their kids singing  that song. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, really?  Is that the latest thing?  Everyone wants to see it.  You've got to see this.  It's adorable.  No, it's not.  You don't think it's cute?  No.  Oh, my God, you're not kidding.  Dude, it's, like, constant.  Everyone thinks their kids are fucking superstars.  Ah, boy.  Oh, sure.  Delightful.  Belt it out.  Sure, sing.  Look at her just standing there dramatically waiting.  A mountain to the night.  Yeah.  And it's funny because kids can't sing very low, and that starts very low, her voice. 
[00:06:00]  So the kids are, like, uh, uh.  She's wearing a white crown against a white background.  It's like the Gervais music video.  Yeah.  Travis, is there a Riley video like this where she sings?  See?  Every little kid.  Is there really?  Yeah, but we didn't post ours on the internet.  Oh, okay.  I have it on my phone.  Have you watched it in just at all?  It's hilarious.  Little kids sound like they're on helium constantly. 
[00:06:30]  It's hard.  Kids being dramatic, you can't just help but, like, like, like, my wife's, we sit there  and just laugh at her.  Yeah.  Here we go.  I never get this shit.  Yeah.  You're flat.  Yeah.  I see the comments.  Yeah, don't talk about it like that.  You're the kid, Ope.  Let's see the comments.  Oh, the comments will be great.  Look, I'm not a big fan of it, but, I mean, I wouldn't be as cruel as some of these comments  are. 
[00:07:00]  Kids so good.  Other people have been pretty nice.  What is it?  Amazing, so adorable.  Good, but you should practice a little more.  And it's only because you're a really high voice.  All right.  You are amazing.  Amazing.  She's not amazing.  She's any kid singing.  You are rubbish.  Rubbish.  Some England guy.  You're rubbish.  Keep going.  Let's see what else.  You saw one of the Oscar, right?  Yeah.  She sang it at the Oscars.  That was a damn good performance.  Yeah, you know, if you're into that kind of thing. 
[00:07:30]  I do like this one.  I want to plea to Hollywood to hurry up with the next animation, please.  You've had it with this one?  Us parents can't handle this?  Same fucking movie over and over again?  Oh, my God.  Oh, shut up, kid.  I like the opening of Frozen.  Yeah?  Yeah, that song is all right.  What's the opening song?  I don't know.  I can't sing it.  Come on, just give us a bar.  They're cutting their ice.  Oh.  They're cutting their blocks ice out. 
[00:08:00]  Oh.  Do you got the opening song?  Oh.  Yeah, this one.  I like Let It Go.  Oh, boy.  It's a good song.  Entenman?  What?  What's his name?  Entenman's?  I don't know.  What is this?  Oh.  Why isn't it the actual movie?  Oh, that's just the, like...  What is this?  Yeah, kind of like an Enya or something.  I don't know.  That's not the opening song, though, when they're collecting their ice.  I bet they can.  Their blocks of ice.  I bet they can have the opening song. 
[00:08:30]  People posting videos of their kids on YouTube is like parents bringing pictures of their kids  on vacation to the office back in the day.  Yeah.  But at least on YouTube, you can either look or not look.  Or these things are better because you're not trapped with the dumb parent looking at  you.  Like, they're like, hey, go check it out if you want to watch it.  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah, this is it.  The Ice Worker.  The Space Book.  They're constantly just putting their dumb videos up there.  God damn, Charlotte Swift is lovely.  She does have nice gams.  Wow. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, boy.  Sounds like, um, La Cive.  Is that the one?  Oh.  No.  Le Mis.  Yeah, Le Mis.  I'm glad I didn't know that.  There's a fags here.  Oh.  Oh.  I like this one.  Now it turns into, um, Rawhide. 
[00:09:30]  Rawhide.  Rawhide.  Yeah, we don't have to do this.  Get him up.  Move him out.  What?  Why am I doing this?  Why am I doing this?  You're torturing yourself.  I, let's see.  One, two, three, four, five.  Probably heard that song seven, eight times this weekend.  Easily.  Jesus.  Easily.  A lot of driving.  And that's the go-to movie right now in the car.  That whole thing.  That whole repetitive cartoony thing.  But if I turn the movie off, then I get puke, so. 
[00:10:00]  Well, you keep that movie on.  Why wouldn't that make them sick?  Look at the screen.  That would make me sick.  Keep that movie on.  They look at the screen and it keeps them focused.  As soon as that movie turns off, they're puking all over the place.  Is there a jet tile vomiting happening?  It's so weird.  Kids still get cars in.  Oh, my God.  Keep that fucking shit on.  I might have to throw my car out.  You got to just throw it out.  Are they both puking it?  Oh, boy, have they.  Is it sour-y?  Oh, man.  Giggy?  Gets in all the crevices.  Yeah.  They got to figure out a better car seat because that puke gets in all the tiny little crevices 
[00:10:30]  and folds.  The nooks and crannies.  Oh, it's brutal.  It still stinks.  Wait till the summer when the sun's beating on it.  Like, this is the winter and the summer when you open up your car door and it's fucking  120 degrees in there, just baking the vomit.  Yeah.  So, whatever.  I got to get a new car.  I got to figure out which one I want.  Yeah.  And, of course, I got to figure out a dealership where they're not going to, like, fucking  rip me off.  They fuck you.  Is there one dealership out there that's not trying to fucking rip you off? 
[00:11:00]  Well, don't go for the undercoat.  Well, now I'm going to get a whole bunch of...  Need that true coat.  ...about that.  Well, he's never done this before.  He's going to knock $100 off of that true coat.  Right.  He's never done this before.  Fucking liar.  I'm not going to a Great Neck Nissan.  Anyone that yells like that, I don't want to deal with.  $500.  $500!  I ordered mine.  A Nissan?  Not from Great Neck Nissan.  No.  Oh, your new car.  Yeah, the 2015. 
[00:11:30]  Cadillac?  Pick it up in June.  Yeah.  Yeah, I had to extend my lease so I could get the new one.  Is that a good car to start the revolution with?  Yeah, I think it is.  I could hook up some fucking gun armaments to it.  Oh, yeah.  I don't understand this business at all anymore because we've had a million rants on this radio  show and they picked that one to throw all over the place.  And then it's only part of it.  Yeah.  Like, I guess now I'm a right-wing conservative.  Welcome.  I haven't shown that whatsoever on this radio show. 
[00:12:00]  Well, I have read comments that was like, well, I'm sure he voted for Obama.  Good for that lefty.  Like, people have no idea about the show.  They just read the story, the news story.  Yeah.  And then they want to comment that because we're in media, we're lefties.  But then the people that heard the rant is like, oh, they're right-wing fanatics.  Like, no.  And they're all lazy because, all of them, they took one seven-minute clip and they all 
[00:12:30]  just posted it everywhere, which is nice for us, of course.  Nice exposure.  But if they just would have done their own research, which wouldn't have been hard at  all, there's at least another hour that they could have picked from and got some more clips,  I guess, I was going to say better clips, whatever.  Right.  It would have told more of the story, anyway.  Mm-hmm.  And then somebody, a few people are saying that's what they get for voting for Obama.  I know.  That was another one.  I've never voted in my life, and I'm proud of that.  I'm actually proud that I've never voted. 
[00:13:00]  Never voted.  It started out as laziness.  I'm not going to lie to you.  And then as the years went by, it just became like a badge of honor.  A George Carlin type of thing, to not vote, to express your opinions about politics by  not voting.  I think if you look at my Twitter profile picture, you could pretty much assume I didn't  vote for Obama.  It's like me with a .50 caliber and an NRA logo across it.  I don't think it's the Obama fucking demo. 
[00:13:30]  And back in the day, I used to scream Obama on this radio show, not because I was excited  about Obama being president, even Sean Hannity got this one wrong over the years, one of  the reasons why I stopped going on this show, because he thought I was an Obama supporter.  I was yelling Obama back in the day because to bother the people that didn't want the  black president, knowing that it was happening, you could just feel the energy in this country  that Obama was absolutely going to be the president.  So that's why I started yelling Obama! 
[00:14:00]  Oh, boy.  Just to fucking bother people.  Obama president, nah.  So, I guess we're starting the revolution.  It's so fucked up because it's like, the quote was, I'm surprised there hasn't been a revolution.  Right.  Not we're starting it, or here it comes, or anything.  Look, media-ite, radio host Opie and Anthony call for revolution.  Revolution.  Over Obamacare cancellation.  I remember saying, like, I am so surprised there hasn't been a revolution over this.  I said it. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, whatever, it don't matter.  Which, by the way, how funny is it, the irony of all ironies, that that whole thing was started  by you, all the political discussions we've had, and Opie just throws up, they should  start a revolution, right?  Yeah, yeah.  And it fucking hits Drudge.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't care about politics in general.  And I was just annoyed that they canceled my health insurance because I got to, I don't  know, I got to add more things.  Yeah.  So it was just an aside, but the headline, Opie and Anthony call for a revolution. 
[00:15:00]  Call for a revolution?  I'm going to watch Frozen another hundred times.  I don't have time for that.  But it was kind of cool.  It's just funny what they get wrong, though.  Yeah.  A lot of stuff to get wrong.  Oh, yeah.  Yes, they do.  No one does their research, but that's the media.  And the way it works with the internet, a lot of blogs, a lot of websites that are tied 
[00:15:30]  to legitimate news sources, but you know that it's just pretty much a room of bloggers doing  the web portion of it.  Right.  So they just pick, cut and paste.  It was a huge cut and paste.  It was the exact clip going everywhere.  I was like, man, why don't you just dig slightly deeper?  You'll find an hour discussion on it.  They don't do that.  What are you going to do?  They don't do that.  And then people get out calling us liars.  Why not?  They didn't.  Because that didn't happen with your insurance.  It's like, no, it did. 
[00:16:00]  I swear.  It did.  Yeah.  And it's like, he's fighting out now?  Well, if you go back to a past discussion, I told everyone, I only check my mail once a  month.  So I got kind of fucked on that one.  Got a little fucked?  There's no way I'm going to check my mail more than once a month.  Yeah.  I know about when the bills are due.  And I go down to my mailbox and they get annoyed in my building because they have to  like bundle it and keep it somewhere else.  Yeah.  And then I go upstairs with all the junk mail and find the bills and pay them. 
[00:16:30]  I hate going to my mailbox sometimes.  Why?  I don't understand why I don't do it.  I just like, I'll do it tomorrow.  Because you know, there's nothing good.  It's all bills and junk mail.  Even though the store swears, oh, no, we just need it for our records.  We're not going to send you anything.  Uh-huh.  And I don't fall for it at all, but I'm like, oh, Jesus, all right, whatever it takes to  get me out of your face.  And then sure enough, you get the four-inch catalog stuffing up your mailbox. 
[00:17:00]  They're all liars.  And I love the people that get annoyed when you go, they go, address, and I go, no, phone  number, no.  And then they huff and puff.  So my new thing is, would you give your address and phone number when you're shopping?  Yes, I do.  And then they have nothing to say back to that.  Giant catalog taking up your fucking space.  We're blind to their tyranny.  Well, what sucks now is they don't even need that info.  They swipe that card.  It's on there.  So they're going to send their shit anyway now. 
[00:17:30]  The old days, they had to ask for it or something.  I don't know what changed, but.  I just say I don't have a phone or I don't have email.  Right.  Can you have your phone?  I don't have a phone.  Right.  There's nothing they can say to that.  I had one person actually say, well, then we can't ring you up.  Yeah.  What are you talking about?  You can't ring me up.  Get the manager.  That's exactly what I said.  Oh, that, yeah.  And then, of course, it was something like, well, we'll make an exception.  Exception?  Are you making an exception?  Shut it. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, so what else about the revolution?  Was that it?  Pretty much in those articles?  Just kind of that.  We're Obama supporters that got what?  Yeah, got what we deserve.  That's right.  And we voted for him.  Absolutely.  And others saying we're right-wing conservatives.  Right-wing nuts that just don't like Obama because he's black.  And then others are saying, oh, poor babies can't handle, poor baby millionaires can't handle  a little paperwork.  Yeah, yeah.  And that's why I wish they, you know, dug a little deeper.  Yeah.  Because I'll speak for myself. 
[00:18:30]  I said, in the end, I got plenty of money and it's more of an annoyance, but this is  really affecting people.  Affecting other people.  Yeah.  They don't really have to budget their money.  Yeah, exactly.  That was said many times during that discussion.  Those are the people I really worry about.  Call for a revolution.  Send the millionaires.  That's right.  Shut the fuck up.  Because those are the people that keep this country going.  I don't want those people weakened by another bill.  Let's get another one going.  Death to the middle class.  Yes.  They're the problem. 
[00:19:00]  Come on, run with it, drudge.  Yeah, they're getting all these big breaks.  The middle class has been cruising too easy.  Oh, let's see.  I'm a pro photographer.  Apple pushed a critical security update on me.  I installed it and it destroyed hours of work.  I can relate to this guy.  Does he back up his stuff?  Yeah.  Dave in Portland, I sort of can relate to you.  Go ahead.  Well, I'm calling for a revolution in Cupertino.  What in the hell has gone on up in Cupertino since Steve Jobs passed away? 
[00:19:30]  That dumb Tim Cook.  That's what's going on.  Yeah.  Yeah, dude.  You know, Tim Cook's excited about bicycles.  I've said for like the last two years, the guy should resign from Apple and found a startup  biking company because that's what he cares about.  Didn't he fire a big tech guy too?  Wasn't it like their stock dropped after one of their major tech guys got fired because  he wanted to apologize for something?  Well, basically the guy, the head software guy who Steve Jobs bought over from, what was 
[00:20:00]  the previous company Jobs was with before?  Kluds Bar.  That's smart.  Yeah.  So, say, the head coder has been like the main OS guy.  He led the iPhone team.  And I guess he and Jonathan Ive had a battle over what the icon should look like.  And the software guy got the boot.  Jonathan Ive, who knows nothing about programming whatsoever. 
[00:20:30]  I don't think the guy knows a line of code.  He's now been...  Nerd insult.  Nerd salt.  They're just fucked up.  So, what happened to me is I'm a pro photographer.  Wait, did you say icicles in there somewhere?  Icicles.  Did you say icicle or something?  No.  What did he say about it?  No.  All right.  Anyway, go ahead.  He said that the one guy was a pro coder.  Yeah.  It was like 11 o'clock at night.  They pushed this critical security update. 
[00:21:00]  I was stupid enough to accept it.  Oh, boy.  12 hours later, I was still installing the update.  My boss is asking me, where are the photos?  I said, well, they're on my computer, and it's in the process of updating.  I pitched the iPhone, so I couldn't make a Genius Bar appointment.  So, I walk into Apple Store at 11 o'clock yesterday when they opened, and they tell me I got a...  When are we listening to this?  I don't know.  Sorry, when are we listening to this?  I mean, I feel for you.  Because it's Monday.  I think the point should be with this.  Why didn't you back it up before you did the update? 
[00:21:30]  I didn't even know what the hell I was doing.  Oh, boy.  Boy, that's not good.  Prosecuting attorney Jimmy just fucking got you.  And you sound tech-savvy.  Yeah.  And there's also that button.  When a security update comes, they always say, back up new photos now.  Back up your shit.  No, this was a different one.  This was like it said...  I guess why we're listening to this, guys, because a lot of times you update your phone, 
[00:22:00]  and all of a sudden you lose something.  Yeah.  What is that about?  I always back it up first, because that's why I hated...  What was right before iCloud?  What was that one before where you'd back up your shit automatically?  Mobile me?  No, mobile me.  I fucking hate it.  I won't use iCloud either for that reason.  I'm losing stuff.  Apple sucks in the cloud.  What is that?  Apple is a hardware company.  It puts you with the clues.  They're all going with the clues.  Put the picture up on the clues.  Exactly.  Who do you guys trust with the clues?  Just the public in general. 
[00:22:30]  I just throw it out there.  Just randomly email your stuff to people.  So many dick pictures of mine floating around anyway.  I'm a Samsung guy, sir.  I've never believed in the Apple, although I like their MacBook, so I should shut my mouth.  Well, I can't get a white glove appointment.  I want to use my new phone, but I can't.  But as far as my phones go, I've been Samsung for a while now.  BlackBerry to Samsung.  Huh?  You guys got top grade to the fives?  We're getting the fives in like two weeks. 
[00:23:00]  They gave us the Samsung Note 3, Galaxy Note 3.  I like it, but it's a little too big.  We're on the Nexus 5.  I've given up on Apple.  I'm waiting.  I hear you, sir.  I hear you.  Thank you, buddy.  It's like some guy that grabs you at CES and just won't shut up.  We don't know what you're talking about, sir.  This is Tech Talk.  It is Tech Talk.  This is Tech Talk.  Tech Talk Mondays.  Hold on.  We're going to help you out.  Greg in Jersey is going to help you out.  Greg in Jersey, help out Dave in Portland.  Go ahead.  Or a gunshot. 
[00:23:30]  This guy's a fucking idiot.  Wait, what?  He's a fucking idiot.  Say it again.  Fucking idiot.  Why?  He's talking about bicycles.  Opie, you're right.  He said something about icicles.  He said that the other guy only cares about icicles.  Bicycles.  Oh.  He said, thank you.  He said all he cares about icicles.  So what does icicles mean?  Bicycles.  Oh, bicycles.  Oh, it's his accent.  Two icicles.  Oh.  Yeah, no, dude.  He doesn't know what he's talking about. 
[00:24:00]  All right, hold on.  Let me go to Keith the Apples.  What are you, Keith?  I'm Jimmy's Apple Consultant.  Oh, this guy.  What's up?  Did you know you had your own Apple Consultant, Jimmy?  Yes, I do know, Keith.  Go ahead, Keith.  Jimmy's got my home number, too, so close to the way.  Whoa, what's going on there?  This guy's going to spout off.  At least know who the hell you're talking about.  The guy who left Apple was Scott Forrestal.  And he was... 
[00:24:30]  Have an aircraft carrier named after him?  Sure.  He was Steve Jobs' heir apparent, as far as software design goes.  And the biggest problem is, is that John Van Eyde is a hardware specialist, and because he cannot be the guy who ever leaves Apple, that's why he lost the fight between Scott Forrestal and himself.  Because Scott leaves, you get some software design. 
[00:25:00]  Is the audience mean to us or something?  Yes.  Did they need punishing?  It's because of that first caller.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  That makes sense.  So everyone has to suffer.  Yeah.  John Van Eyde leaves, you lose all of Apple's industrial design.  Oh, of course.  Unfortunately, you get iOS 7.  Oh.  I love talking iOSs.  I'll say this, though.  Whatever happened with Apple, there's a definite fucking difference, and I noticed the difference.  Like, they've done nothing interesting in a little while.  Fearless leaders did.  Yeah, but I mean, he wasn't the guy who was sitting there doing every design. 
[00:25:30]  He was kind of the inspiration, I think.  Maybe.  Okay.  He's that muse, perhaps.  Yeah.  Apple just announced the Worldwide Developers Conference for the beginning.  Yawn!  Oh, yeah.  Isn't it reasonable?  No, but that's when they'll introduce iOS 8.  Oh.  What about the next product, though?  When do they come out with the next product?  The icon's going to look a little different.  Yeah, they'll shake more in your mood.  Yeah, little shaky icons or something.  I think Samsung has all the momentum right now.  I think you're right.  Oh, boy. 
[00:26:00]  All the analysts are talking about what Apple's entry in the wearable space is going to be,  whether it's going to be a watch or something fitness-related.  A watch?  Samsung already has the watch.  Yeah.  Well, you've got to have some interfaces with the iPhone.  I didn't say the watch.  Ugh.  I think we'll get all those answers in June.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  Thanks, Dave.  See you guys later.  Thanks, Keith.  The watch is already out like the...  I didn't...  Dave, you said that it turns on all the time when you're driving.  Who said this?  He sounds like a failure. 
[00:26:30]  No, the watch?  No?  No.  We're done with you, Dave.  Thank you.  Wow.  I like the watch.  I'm just not like an accessory guy.  I'm waiting for the smaller one and the regular, the five.  A lot of people like the watch.  Yeah.  I can't try it because I haven't had a white glove appointment.  Oh, no.  What's going on with you and your white glove appointment?  I had no idea that we had this.  I would have canceled my appointment and stayed that day.  I just didn't know that that was part of it.  Mm-hmm.  And I would have sat with you guys, right? 
[00:27:00]  See?  We learned so much and then I forgot everything the next day.  Yeah.  I just forgot.  So I need another course on this thing.  Did you get a new number or you used your old number?  Old number because I'm all about the Samsung.  I have a Samsung number, too.  You have a new number.  Okay.  Well, yeah, I had one.  I had a Samsung number and then I just unplugged the card.  Do tell.  I did.  I took the card out and I plugged it in the new phone and it's fantastic.  I love you.  Speaking of Samsung, no more selfies at the White House. 
[00:27:30]  No, huh?  Because of Poppy there.  Because of Big Poppy?  Big Poppy took a selfie and it turned out to be, what, some kind of promotion for the Samsung phone?  Who cares?  Well, I think in Washington the important thing to do, because there's no other problems with finances or corruption,  I think the important thing to do is worry if the designated hitter got a Samsung mention in.  The amount of money that is thrown around in that shitty town and they're worried about fucking David Ortiz taking a cell, who cares?  Don't worry about it.  What do you mean he got a Samsung mention in? 
[00:28:00]  I mean, I would say holding the phone up.  It's probably just a deal, some kind of an endorsement.  It is.  It's an endorsement thing from Samsung.  But how do the people know that?  I guess...  Big Poppy's with Samsung, but isn't he just doing it because he wants a selfie with the president?  No, I think it was get a selfie with the president with the Samsung phone.  Right.  And we'll talk about it.  First of all, why would he announce that deal?  Stupid that he is.  Who cares either way?  Right.  What you do with the dumb picture when you have it.  And don't you kind of expect a selfie to be done either by an iPhone or a Samsung at this point? 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  It would be amazing if it was a Pebble or something, right?  Yeah.  Some phone that no one knows about.  Right.  Or a home phone, just picking up off the fucking receiver.  After the stunts, Samsung revealed it had a marketing deal with Ortiz and admitted that  company officials had worked with David and the team on how to share images with fans.  Also, he's white glove as well.  Oh, yeah.  I thought the white glove thing was special.  Oh, no. 
[00:29:00]  I'm starting to find out that a lot of people have that white glove.  Yeah.  Of course.  A lot of people.  Yeah.  Who cares, though?  Why is this a huge story?  That's pretty good.  You get a selfie with the fucking president, though.  Right.  I would love one.  Yeah.  Why would I say that?  Who cares?  You all said love?  Cronut.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, we're going to talk about the Cronut.  Oh, yeah.  I was just waiting for Roland to arrive.  Yeah.  So we're going to talk about his boy.  And then there's that fake Roland account on Twitter that looks like Roland. 
[00:29:30]  And it just says the worst, horrible things.  And Roland keeps having to go.  That's not me.  It's a fake account.  It's a fake account.  And not me.  I will find this guy.  I'll find this guy.  I will hunt you down.  What's the guy saying?  He's just saying horrible things about the Cronut plays.  Which one's making you laugh?  Oh, that's not nice.  Can you bring ten rat-dropping milk and cookie shots in on Twitter?  And then Roland's like, no, no, I didn't say that. 
[00:30:00]  Not me.  It's not nice.  I got to tell you, I was surprised that no one tweeted us the news story on the Cronut  garage.  Right?  Oh, I got it, guys.  I almost missed it.  Because I didn't get one tweet about it with the link.  Holy shit.  It's safe to say, if the story's been out there for, I don't know, 12 hours, someone  sent it to us.  Please.  Don't worry about it.  I beg you, stop.  Please stop.  It's like when a radio station says, be the 10th caller and you'll win.  Right.  And then, like, you get a busy signal for five minutes. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  They have the winner, like, instantly.  Instantly.  It's already done.  Right.  If you have the news and the link, we have it.  Pretty much.  You don't have to send it.  Even if we tell everyone never to send us, like, breaking news again, we'll still get  the breaking news from people that will ignore that plea.  Yeah.  Don't worry about it.  Roland is here.  Roland, come on down.  It's kind of weird, though. 
[00:31:00]  The Cronut guy gets all that heat.  He's doing really well.  And out of nowhere, they shut him down for, what are they calling it?  Severe mouse infestation.  They're saying severe?  What was the word they used?  Yeah.  Severe.  That was the word.  It was severe.  Cronut Bakery.  I was there.  I never saw a mouse.  It's probably one of those things that you can't.  There's probably, if there's more than two, they might, whatever the number is.  How do you avoid that when you're a baker?  Well, you remember my old apartment and the stories I used to tell on this show. 
[00:31:30]  Even if you're killing the mice left and right, you realize there's just hundreds and hundreds  in the walls.  So, Roland, how's Dominic doing?  All kidding aside, I do have to say this.  We'll have a little fun with this fucking story.  But I'm all in with Dominic.  He's one of the nicest guys you'll ever meet.  He's always been cool to this radio show.  And I hope he makes a huge turnaround.  Yeah, and I think somebody was after him, though, too.  You think?  Oh, you think it's a conspiracy? 
[00:32:00]  Well, usually the DOH, they go to check your place to help, but not four in one day.  Oh, shit.  So who did he piss off?  Obviously.  Who knows?  These mice are communist plants.  Well, if you go look at Google some restaurants, they all, like 90% of them, mice droppings, mice droppings.  Oh, the mice are all over the city.  And when you get them, they are so hard to get rid of.  We used to lay awake at night in my bed in my old apartment, listening to them fucking fighting on the other side of the walls. 
[00:32:30]  And my bedroom was downstairs in kind of the basement.  And then you could hear them in the ceiling.  So between the ceiling and the floor upstairs, there were hundreds of them, too.  And I was killing, how many was I killing at one point?  Two or three a day easily in the electric traps.  That was so fucked up.  I forgot the number, but it was well over 70 that I killed.  And I didn't even make a dent in the problem in that apartment.  You were infested.  Yeah, just like this dominant guy, I guess. 
[00:33:00]  And who shot that video?  That's why they asked for them to come and talk to them, and nobody's fessed up who did it.  There's a video where you see a mouse running across the floor.  It's the guy from Crumbs.  Probably.  There he goes.  I saw him.  That was it.  Wait a minute.  So is that from the customer's point of view?  Yeah.  They didn't know who did it.  Some customer probably just saw it and, you know,  Wow.  Yeah.  He must have saw him and then started his camera. 
[00:33:30]  Mice are hateable.  Oh, yeah.  And it went viral, and they said, I didn't know it, but it came shut down.  That was it.  You saw a mouse run across the floor, which is so fucking gross, to be honest with you.  Well, it's in the customer area, so that's kind of...  But you're crazy if you don't think there's a mouse pretty much in every restaurant in New York City.  Yeah, but you sure don't want to see him.  Right.  Yeah.  Pretty much.  That Junta virus fucking...  I shouldn't say it's 100%, but that number's got to be way up there. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  Way up there.  Especially on the ground floor.  Right.  If you're higher up, it's probably a little easier to avoid them.  And use an outdoor guarded area, too, so that raises up another level.  How do they get in, though?  If you seal every area...  Like, roaches are harder to keep out, but how does a mouse get in if you block up every little fucking hole?  Oh, man.  You leave the doors open for the spring.  I don't think you can block up every hole.  Yeah.  And they're sneaky, and they're quick, and they're like...  They're kind of stealth.  It's kind of weird.  Before I realized I was infested, I used to feel like I was seeing things move across the floor. 
[00:34:30]  And then I thought, ah, I'm just going crazy.  And then finally saw that first one, and then I'm like, ah, we got a mouse.  How cute.  That's nice.  And then I started seeing the same mouse every day.  I'm like, ah, look.  The same one.  Our little friend.  And then when I dug deeper and realized, oh, my God, I'm not seeing the same mouse.  I'm seeing a different mouse all the time.  He's a magician.  He goes in there and appears out here in another room.  And then I would walk to the corner on Columbus Avenue. 
[00:35:00]  My apartment was in a little bit, and every garbage pail at night was just filled with mice.  Looking for food.  Every single brownstone as you made it to the corner.  You ever see those piles of black garbage bags on the corner?  I jump into them.  Yes.  It's nice.  And they're moving.  Right.  Like it's just...  Oh, yeah.  The whole thing rumbles with rats inside the bags.  Well, I don't see rats.  I see mice way more than rats in this city.  And they say, though, if you have mice, that's actually a good thing, because that means you don't have rats. 
[00:35:30]  Because the rats just will destroy the mice.  Yeah.  So, I mean, between the two, I'd rather have mice.  And they say that's new construction.  They all come out.  Yeah, because they shake up their shit.  Oh, yeah.  You know what?  I prevented them.  I saw one once in my old apartment.  I put up a sign that said, no mice.  Oh, wow.  And it stopped them from coming in.  It worked out?  Like, you see that sign?  It means not welcome.  Right.  Not welcome.  Well, then you got the Dunkin' Donuts video that did pretty well the last few days with the rats running around the Dunkin' Donuts. 
[00:36:00]  They're actually working there.  Yeah, show that again.  You got the rat where they keep the donuts.  Where's the rat?  I think it's on the donut.  Oh, that's not good.  Oh, man.  Oh, wow.  That's a big rat.  That fucking rat.  Boy, if you're a rat, that's the place to be.  Right?  Behind some Dunkin' Donuts.  It actually helps the flavor there.  Oh, Roland.  Have you heard from Dominic?  No, I haven't heard from him.  He's been...  Crying? 
[00:36:30]  Well, I know they shut down the restaurant, cleaned it for like 10 hours from top to bottom.  They made them.  It's going to take longer than that, man.  10 hours.  You got to get inside those walls.  Oh, I mean, but then you have to hire the people.  I'm sure he's doing everything he can.  I'm sure he's hiring the top guy, but you know what sucks?  He's going to lose all that momentum.  You think his lines are going to come back immediately when he reopens?  Well, I feel bad for him.  The minute it happened, they had every news crew out there waiting for him.  Of course.  Yeah, he left.  Yeah, I feel bad. 
[00:37:00]  Because we live in a world where you've got to knock down your people.  Yeah.  If someone's doing too well, you've got to knock them down.  Get them down.  And you've got to have that camera right in their face when it happens.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I'll still go eat there.  It'll be the cleanest place in New York.  I'll go there in a second.  Delicious.  Yeah, because you can tell that, you know, that he takes care of his place.  I don't think he's sitting there thinking, ah, fuck it, screw it.  I can work around the mice.  He takes pride in what he does. 
[00:37:30]  You don't think he's ever seen a mouse in his place, though?  Man, man.  I've been like, oh, boy, I better take care of this.  He might have.  You can't not see a mouse in a bakery.  There's no way to have a place in New York City where you don't see one.  I think it's an impossibility for any place to not see one.  You get the flour, the sugar.  Are you all right today?  Because they hit two places over the weekend.  You know the other place, right?  Which one?  John's.  John's Pizza, which is my favorite pizza place in New York.  That was like 2012 or 13? 
[00:38:00]  I thought it looked like it was over the weekend.  So why did that pop up again?  It was a while.  Let's talk about famous eateries that have gotten hit.  Yeah, they started talking about New York famous eateries.  Are you sure?  Because I remember when that happened.  Yeah, John's on Bleecker.  Yeah, put John.  I've never eaten.  2012.  I don't want to say that.  Most restaurants in the country have never eaten in.  Never eaten in.  Yes.  Came closed, uh, what year?  God, I got to read better. 
[00:38:30]  I thought they hit John's over the weekend.  So John's has been reopened since then, and I've eaten there since then.  Okay.  That's my favorite pizza place in New York.  Yeah, the one was going around different boroughs with rat problems.  That's in the West Village.  It's amazing.  I said go there.  It's delicious.  It's a little better than Grimaldi's.  Oh, wow.  Well, Grimaldi's move locations.  I know.  So the oven's different, too.  Is that what the problem is?  Yeah, the hole.  Oh, they weren't nice in Grimaldi's.  No, they're not. 
[00:39:00]  What's Grimaldi's?  In Brooklyn?  It's kind of under the Brooklyn Bridge, more or less.  Roberto's is amazing.  You're one of the pizza?  Yeah.  If the Grimaldi's pizza people are listening, you have some employees there that are not  nice, because they've had it with the tourists, I guess.  So they're just kind of assholes, to be honest with you.  The manager that said hi to us, he was great.  A few of the people out front were great, but then you get deeper into the restaurant  and the waiters, they were waiters. 
[00:39:30]  They were just not nice, to be honest with you, and couldn't wait for you to get the fuck  out of there, so they could push more people through the place.  I love Roberto's, but they're full of hipsters, though.  Where's that place?  Brooklyn.  Oh, okay.  Bushwick, I think.  Hipsters.  It was.  They're like, hi, dude.  What's going on?  Give me your delicious pizza and be gone.  I don't mind any pizza place.  It's just like, you go in New York City, you could get good pizza.  You don't have to pick a specific pizza place in New York City. 
[00:40:00]  It's pretty good.  But you have whole pizza, or you have a different oven pizza?  I used to think that, but I'm telling you, man.  It's like your basic, giant fucking slice of pizza.  That's it.  Ew.  What, from like Sparrow or something?  No, no, no.  Not Sparrow.  Like a regular pizza joint.  Joe's on 6th Avenue.  Like Rays or something.  I don't like Rays.  Regular Rays.  Original Rays.  Original Rays.  Legendary Rays.  Rays with a hat.  Yeah.  Even bad pizza. 
[00:40:30]  What is that fucking?  It's New York pizza.  It's going to be fucking okay.  What's that old gag about pizza?  Even a bad one is like good because it's pussy or something.  Is that how it goes?  Blowjob?  What?  What is it?  It's like a blowjob because it's still a blowjob.  But it's a bad one, even a bad one is pretty good.  Something like that.  That old gag.  That old gag-a-rooney.  But I really believe there are way better pizza joints out there now.  Have you ever been to John's?  No.  Take a lady down to John's Pizza. 
[00:41:00]  I am.  In the West Village.  I think you'll, yes, it's amazing.  But don't do what I did and have a craving for spaghetti.  Uh-oh.  They looked at me like, what the fuck's wrong with you?  You get pizza here.  Right.  So I had a few slices and it was excellent.  But then I ordered this big, giant spaghetti thing.  Yeah.  Which was just okay.  The pizza's good.  The spaghetti, not so much.  Not so much.  They know that too.  They're like 99.9% of the people go there for pizza and idiots like me every once in a while. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  Order something different.  All right.  So John's didn't close over the weekend.  No.  Because I didn't read it properly.  Did the Corona joint have an A rating?  That's what it had?  That just goes to show you that A don't mean shit, huh?  I started doing some research on the ratings for that stuff.  You can receive up to 14 points of violation before you get a B.  Wow.  And I found this thing here.  It's a screenshot from October 2013 that he even had a report of mice present at the location and filth flies. 
[00:42:00]  Which filth flies?  Like fruit flies.  Yeah.  I just don't see how you can...  What is the way to avoid all...  You can't avoid all that.  We just got some knowledge from the mustache.  Thank you, mustache.  Thank you, Sean.  And what I also learned was that the worst thing to see is a grade pending.  Because that means that they've been inspected a few times.  They received a grade.  And then that means that they actually did worse on a follow-up inspection.  Oh, shit.  So you'd rather eat at a B or a C than a grade pending. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  What is a C?  Yeah, like Mexican drug.  That's got to be really bad.  The C rating's great because they try to hide it.  They put like a flower plant in front of it or something.  A little poster for a local event.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Anything.  Anything to distract you.  Some of their rotted meat that they're serving.  Child porn.  Anything more pleasant that will get you in the restaurant.  I guess that's, like, illegal, though. 
[00:43:00]  You've got to make sure that grade is displayed.  I do pick out only A, restaurants.  Like, when you're walking around, it's like, oh, I might well go in here.  And it's like, B, fuck it.  I'll look.  Really?  Yeah.  I never notice.  I do notice.  If the menu looks good, I'm good.  They could have a D.  If they've got something good on the menu, screw it.  F.  F.  Every restaurant has animals and shit in it.  I was at a bar this weekend and got a free drink after spotting a cockroach. 
[00:43:30]  Per se earned a C grade.  Per se is, like, the fucking best restaurant in the country.  Why?  And they received a C grading.  Why?  Laugh.  And stop.  42 violations.  42.  Stop with the best restaurant in the country.  Yeah.  How do you know that?  It's Thomas Keller.  He does the French Laundry in California.  He does per se.  Oh, Helen's brother, right?  Yeah.  You know that place?  I don't want to say the name of it.  It's on our block.  And it's one of the places I used to eat at all the time, about two blocks up from us. 
[00:44:00]  It's fucking amazing.  I've seen roaches in there twice.  And ants once.  And I saw a roach.  We were eating in the middle of the restaurant, and there was a pole of a roach on that.  What flavor?  Roach.  Greek?  French?  What, the food?  Yeah.  I think it's just American cuisine.  I forget.  It's called...  I don't know if you're right.  I don't know if it's just because Ope knows it.  It's on our block.  Right.  And the food was really... 
[00:44:30]  It was really good.  When you see a roach on the wall in the middle of the afternoon, that means there's so many  fucking roaches.  That's the one that got pushed out.  There's never one roach anywhere.  Never.  I wonder about the holla guys, the cart guys.  I don't know what they do.  The what?  The cart guys.  The food cart guys.  They must get either infested or it's easier to keep them out because it's a small area.  Yeah, they're there constantly.  You keep cleaning it out.  I bet you they have way less infestation. 
[00:45:00]  Although I look at those donuts in them, I'm like, I don't know if I would trust that.  Fucking rats are probably doing the cha-cha.  I would never eat a donut from a cart.  And they're driving around with the cart.  It's like over the puddles.  No, over the 59th Street Bridge.  I'll go local for everybody.  I've seen that.  You get behind one of those guys going back to Queens with their food cart and the donuts  and the rolls are still in the back.  What do you think they're doing?  They're parking that thing.  They're not taking that shit out.  And it's not sealed.  It's not airtight.  You see your donuts bouncing around on the 59th Street. 
[00:45:30]  Bouncing with fucking brake dust.  Oh, my God.  Road scum.  Just get them kicked up.  They have ice in the igloo and they pour it for iced coffee in there.  In the end, though, I wouldn't...  He takes his bare hand and fucking takes ice out of the fucking thing with his...  Wipes his ass with his hand.  Well, I'll eat stuff from those guys if they cook it because you figure out that's burning  some shit off.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  No problem.  I'll eat a disgusting hot dog every so often.  But then, you know, he's using tongs. 
[00:46:00]  He's got his fucking gloves on.  The thing that doesn't make sense is that they wear the glove, but then they take the money  with the glove.  So it's more just disgusting shit on there.  You're right.  Thank you, mustache.  Oh, mustache.  Mustache.  All right.  Mustaches.  My brother-in-law calls you guys mustaches.  Oh.  We were driving around Philly.  He was giving me another one of those wonderful tours.  The hipsters?  He calls them mustache?  Yeah.  He calls them mustaches.  He goes, oh, this is where all the mustaches live. 
[00:46:30]  That's a good one.  I told him I was going to use it, but I got to give him credit.  And we have a mustache among us.  His name is Sal.  Let's go to Elmar or Elmer or something like that in Detroit.  Elmar.  What's up?  Hey, brother.  I got a theory that's going on here.  Last week, you guys were bashing him about not coming in, and now he's closed down.  Right.  I just want you to mess up.  What did you guys do?  Yeah.  Don't fuck with us.  Like we did it.  That's right. 
[00:47:00]  Like when the senator wouldn't play ball in The Godfather 2?  Absolutely.  Anthony Vato Corleone.  I believe this committee is dominating an apology, senator.  Yeah.  Mice.  Lots of mice.  I think someone was out to fuck the Cronut guy, to be honest with you.  He had too much heat.  Too much heat.  It's probably just a competing restaurant or competing.  Or it may have been just that other bakery guy.  His mentor is like three blocks away from him.  I bet you it's that guy. 
[00:47:30]  And then he does the business.  Right.  I bet you all those people that you guys talked about last week that had their own Cronut is probably like salivating about this opportunity.  And you're in Detroit, right?  Yes, sir.  You scrapping?  I'm scrapping every day.  Are you really?  No, no.  Okay.  It sounds like a lot of you guys are scrapping.  I am too, but I think it's a different meaning.  Scrapping.  Yeah.  I closed my shoes.  Scrapping one out.  I think a lot of people saw the Vice thing on scrapping in Detroit.  On HBO.  It was fascinating. 
[00:48:00]  I was watching that, and I'm like, I didn't know that was going on in my hometown.  I watched them to learn stuff.  You angel.  Sounds like you could make a lot of money, though.  They're ripping everything out.  I'm looking at you to do a live show down here.  Do that for a day.  And then they're selling it to the Chinese.  The Chinese.  Who knew?  These Chinamen are coming over, and they're just traveling America to these scrapyards  and making massive deals, and then having all that stuff shipped back to China to rebuild  their infrastructure.  Yeah.  It was cheaper than making it, I guess. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  Way cheaper.  You'd have to mine the shit, and then fucking do all that, and now they just get it, melt  it down, and make whatever they need.  It's really competitive, and they follow one Chinaman around, and then he shows up at  a scrapyard, and there's a whole bunch of other Chinamen there.  Yeah.  All making all sorts of crazy deals.  Buying all kinds of metal.  And then they ship it back to China.  So we're ripping down our city to build up China.  That tells you right there what the fuck is going on in this country.  You saw that one, right?  Yeah.  It was cool, huh? 
[00:49:00]  Yep, very.  I didn't realize you could make that much money off that.  What's the reason for that, though?  Is it because we're using more glass in our skyscrapers than steel?  We don't build anything anymore.  We're not really building as many factories and refineries.  But that is a good question.  We are still building, so why wouldn't we do the same thing and take what's going on  in Detroit and move it to build up another city?  Well, they're probably doing Detroit a favor in a way, because I drive down there, there's  a lot of abandoned buildings, because it's probably just easier for other companies to 
[00:49:30]  come and take it down rather than have the city deal it, because they're burned anyway.  Allegedly.  They follow the guy that's been shot at, and I think he has been shot.  And his whole thing is he sneaks into the actual...  Oh, into the scrapyard.  Scrapyard.  Steals the scrap.  To steal...  Yeah.  To sell to another scrapyard.  Sell to another scrapyard.  Yeah.  Yeah, that guy.  I'm telling you, if you haven't seen it, it's on HBO.  The Vice series is great.  Pretty cool.  Yeah.  And the one on scrap in Detroit is great. 
[00:50:00]  Huh?  Season two just started, aren't you?  Yeah, it's about three weeks in, I guess.  I'm one week behind at least, so I've got to catch up.  I've got to see the Rhino one.  Yeah, I want to see that one, too.  I think he went to WrestleMania.  Oh.  Oh, no.  Does he rock here today?  What?  Yeah.  Did he go to WrestleMania?  He watched it.  He watched it?  Just one more thing, guys.  It's Suicide Watch for Roland, and E-Roc is the Undertaker.  I don't know how much he loves it.  Did the Undertaker finally lose? 
[00:50:30]  They did that to the Undertaker?  Why would they do that?  Oh, boy.  I'll spoil that for you.  My bad.  No, I don't care.  I don't know much about WrestleMania, but I do know that The Undertaker has never lost  at WrestleMania.  Why did they have to do that?  30 years.  He wrote that 10 years ago, though, so to be fair.  They wrote it 10 years ago?  What do you mean?  I'm just kidding.  Oh, man.  That's a good one.  Who beat him?  The wrestling world is stunned, is it?  Oh, Brock?  See, they want to give Brock all the heat.  Well, Brock probably said, I'm not going to lose to this guy again. 
[00:51:00]  Enough.  Yeah.  Yeah, but here's E-Roc.  The Undertaker should have taken a fucking scene.  He's taking a fucking sesame seed and shoved it down Brock's throat.  Give him that particular idea.  Why do they have to do that?  The guy's never lost, and The Undertaker's on his way out, and they...  Look at this fanboy.  Look at his shirts.  Two.  Oh, fanboy!  Here comes fanboy.  Let me see that shirt.  Oh, WrestleMania, right?  WrestleMania, and then a Hulk shirt underneath it.  Oh, someone's a Hulkamaniac.  You're wearing some rowdy-roddy underoos? 
[00:51:30]  Exactly.  Out of my wood.  Yeah.  Hey, Elmar, we like you, man.  Call back, all right?  All right, I appreciate it.  Thanks, guys.  All right, brother.  All right.  All the way from Detroit.  So what's up with this Undertaker?  Why did they make him lose finally?  It's kind of stupid.  I have no idea.  Were you stunned?  Yeah.  Because I think Vince McMahon, in the end, is just an asshole.  Whoa, easy.  The place was perfectly quiet.  Like, nobody expected it.  They thought the match was still going.  Right.  And then everyone realized Brock won.  Because there's no announcer.  So how would they know?  Yeah, exactly.  The thing ends, everybody just goes home. 
[00:52:00]  All right.  Yeah.  Where's the announcer?  What do you mean an announcer?  That's what...  You need an announcer to go in there.  You need an announcer to win there.  You need an announcer to win, and that was our complaint.  You don't need an announcer at the live event.  Nobody knew what happened.  Of course, if everyone doesn't know...  Do you hear Rogan and the UFC guys while the event's won?  No, no, no, no, no, not that announcer.  I mean a ring announcer in there, like Bruce Buffer, when he comes in at the end, and you  know...  The winner!  They did.  Oh, okay.  They did after, you know, one of them got out of the ring, the announcer came in and  announced that Brock had won.  But this was right as it was happening.  They thought the match was still going on. 
[00:52:30]  Sal, turn it this way or I'll bite you on the ear.  I can't see it.  And then all...  Last ride.  And then all of a sudden, he gets the three count, and it just gets completely quiet.  Like everyone's just staring at the ring, not expecting this.  He's standing up now, and Brock's on the ground, right?  And The Undertaker, what?  He only wrestles at Wrestlemania now?  Yeah, for the last few years, he only comes out for Wrestlemania.  He only wrestles once a year.  I remember...  He must have some fucking physical problems.  The Undertaker's from fucking forever ago. 
[00:53:00]  And he runs the whole backstage area, too.  Does he?  Yeah.  What do you mean he runs?  Well, he picked Brock up like nothing.  He's a strong dude.  Fuck.  As far as, like, interacting with the talent and stuff.  Oh.  Yeah, he does a lot of behind-the-scenes stuff.  What is that, the Tombstone?  That's the Tombstone.  Oh, shit.  So now there's...  He's putting his arms over...  The Tombstone was horrendous.  Brock's head was...  Oh.  Brock's head was still two and a half feet from the map.  Yeah.  They have to be sloppy with it now, because too many people were seriously getting hurt.  Like, Stone Cold fucked up his neck from it. 
[00:53:30]  But how about you turn so the camera doesn't catch the fact that his head's not even close  to hitting the map.  Exactly.  Sometimes it's the director's fault, too.  Oh.  They don't, you know, move off the shot too fast.  Right.  How long is this?  They're just laying there.  We're watching two guys' nap.  So how long did you cry after The Undertaker lost last night?  I did not cry, but I did sit there.  I was amazed.  One, that they gave it to Brock Lesnar.  They all jumped up.  That was it?  That was it.  Oh, look at everybody.  They're all freaking out.  Oh, who's this?  That's Heyman.  He's actually a fan. 
[00:54:00]  I know he is.  He's a good dude.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  The people can't even believe it.  This dude is everywhere.  Just say yes to a black wrestling fan.  With his eyes bouldered.  Their hands are over their heads.  Why'd they stop it?  Why are they?  I don't get it.  Because nobody expected this.  What, do they want another predictable result?  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  He was already 21-0.  You figured he was going 22-0.  And, you know, when he eventually retired, he had that record.  Everyone can't believe it.  They're stunned.  Their mouths are deep.  Their mouths are open.  Why get Sam on the phone? 
[00:54:30]  I wasn't shocked.  I know it.  It's like watching a movie, people.  I'm fucking calling Sam.  And also, he's a guy that only does a handful of dates a year.  Good.  He's not a regular guy in the company, so why would they give it to Brock Lesnar?  Because in real life, you would beat the shit out of The Undertaker.  That's why.  Why would they give it to Brock Lesnar?  You're talking about the other guy that had the title did it once a year.  Exactly.  So it doesn't matter if he doesn't come in.  They're tired of him.  Yeah, but they should have used it to give somebody else a bigger push that's in the company.  Yeah, but now The Undertaker could come back and win, and that would be huge. 
[00:55:00]  It won't matter.  Maybe they want to rebuild Brock.  Oh, there's people crying, it looks like.  It won't matter.  God, a bunch of ninnies.  Get a hold of yourselves.  Right.  This is when they should have just sealed the building and gassed it.  These fucking mutants.  And then they put 21 and 1 above the ring.  No music.  Nothing.  Taps?  What are you going to play?  Yeah.  They play their theme song.  Were you sad? 
[00:55:30]  I was amazed they gave it to Brock Lesnar, yes.  Sam.  Hey.  Who gives a fuck The Undertaker lost?  Yeah, he stinks.  I told you that.  What the fuck?  Predictable.  We didn't even know until five minutes ago.  Who cares?  I don't know why you're asking me.  And what's wrong with Vince McMahon?  Why did he have to do that after all these years?  Why couldn't they let The Undertaker go out undefeated at WrestleMania?  Because doing that increases the money that Brock Lesnar brings in the next time he fights. 
[00:56:00]  If Brock Lesnar had lost, people think he's going to just keep losing, and he doesn't seem unbeatable.  But since Brock Lesnar wins, they've made him more marketable.  Let me ask you, were you surprised?  Oh, my God, was I surprised.  Everybody was surprised.  Tell us about the deal in the building when that happened.  Did he cry like a little bitch?  Yeah.  I didn't cry, but I will tell you how the building felt.  Yes.  All right, go ahead, Sam.  Well, it was very strange to have 75,000 people go silent. 
[00:56:30]  Wow.  Really?  Why?  You just had 75,000 people click the radio off?  Yes.  I mean, even where I was sitting, a bunch of the guys that worked there had come up from  the dressing room to watch the show, and they were sitting there in disbelief.  Why?  They didn't get the script ahead of time?  No, they didn't get the script for that match ahead of time.  You don't think anybody knew that was going to happen? 
[00:57:00]  No, I don't think that anybody knew that was going to happen.  Vince did.  Vince, yes.  The Undertaker did.  Brock Lesnar did.  The Undertaker did.  The refs did.  Probably, yes.  But many people did not know.  Oh.  Wouldn't it be great if it wasn't supposed to happen?  The refs just was a dick?  Yeah, the refs did it real quick.  A quick count.  It was a quick count, right?  I mean, it was quick, but the count is only three seconds long anyway.  Oh, boy.  I was like, what the fuck?  So what happened?  Were there tears? 
[00:57:30]  There were tears?  Yes, there were.  There were people crying in that building.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Really?  Oh, my God.  But it's fake.  They scanned that crowd real fast to get all these reactions out.  I'll bet you they knew.  We better have a camera on the crowd or you're fired.  Yeah.  They probably hired the black guy with the Just Say Yes t-shirt, going, okay, look, we're  going to need you for this.  His eyes look like the fucking black guy in the boat in Caddyshack.  Right.  Marina.  Oh, yeah.  Find out who the black guy is.  I say they hired him. 
[00:58:00]  Yes.  It's junkyard dog.  It wouldn't be the first time people cry at something fake.  People cry in movies.  They cry at TV shows.  They cry.  It's emotional.  That's not emotional.  I don't know.  Sam Ra's is a good point.  What a dumb fucking sport entertainment thing.  Sam coming.  I don't know what it is.  Was it a good WrestleMania?  It was one of the better WrestleManias in a long time.  And what did our pal The Hulkster do? 
[00:58:30]  What was his job there?  The Hulkster was the host of the evening.  And his segment, he came out in the very beginning of the night.  And he started calling.  He messed up his thing.  And he was talking about how happy he was to be in the Silverdome when they were in the  Superdome.  Oh, no.  He didn't say that.  Which, for those who don't know, is WrestleMania 3.  And that venue doesn't exist anymore.  Oh, well.  Who did he wrestle? 
[00:59:00]  He didn't wrestle.  He was just acting as the host.  But it turned into an amazing segment because Stone Cold and The Rock both came out as surprises.  And all three in the ring at one time has never happened before.  Wow.  Holy shit.  You're right.  That's never happened before.  I was wondering if that ever happened.  Did you take a picture to remember the moment?  Yeah.  Would you like a photo with all three of them together?  That would be fun.  Yeah.  Wow.  Are you the shit down at WrestleMania?  A lot of people know you?  A lot of people do. 
[00:59:30]  Wow.  You all full of yourself now?  I'm not full of myself, no.  Oh.  You know why?  Just asking.  Why?  Because I'm still nothing to all of you.  Yes.  Yeah, but you're big in the wrestling world now.  Yeah.  That's true.  When are they going to fucking hire you?  Yeah, really?  But that's not what the goal is here.  Oh.  Well, it's ours.  For us it is.  Why else do you think you were flown down?  Me, Ant, and Oak chipped in.  What is that?  One-way ticket.  We'll just keep pushing you in front of their faces, hoping they're finally going to go, 
[01:00:00]  all right, we'll hire this guy.  Oh, man.  All right.  So Undertaker loses.  He only wrestles, what, once a year now?  Yeah, but now he may not wrestle anymore, because what's the value of having him wrestle at  WrestleMania?  Exactly.  He's just going to be on the business end.  Yeah.  Wouldn't he be able to get one more out of him, because then he comes back and wins,  and it's like, okay, yay, he won now.  I guess, but I mean, he's 21-1 now.  It's not, you know, supposed to be end-0. 
[01:00:30]  Go out with a W.  That's Vince just being a dick in the end.  God, he's just a dick.  Vince is just a dick.  He could have figured out getting, you know, the heat going another way than taking The  Undertaker's undefeated record away.  There's never a happy ending with that company.  I know.  Everyone has something.  Was Mr. T there?  Yeah, Mr. T was there, because he went into the Hall of Fame.  Oh.  Was he in the ring, though, for something, or are they just kind of...  Hey, woman!  He didn't get in the ring.  He did a... 
[01:01:00]  He did a...  He did...  Oh, my God.  I've got to give you clips of this tomorrow.  Now, he...  His Hall of Fame speech was the most insane thing you ever heard in your life.  Yeah.  He went 25 minutes about his mother and brought up his mother's urinary tract.  Wow.  Can we find that today?  Why do we have to wait for Sam to cut it?  Is that him now?  He looks fucking great.  He looks exactly like he fucking looked.  That's pretty amazing.  Wow.  Yeah.  But that's one of those looks that...  Oh, here he is.  No, it's...  Is this the...  It's a brief version, right? 
[01:01:30]  It's a minute long, yeah.  Oh, my God.  That's a lot of people backwards.  Let's see what we got.  Tonight, as you honor me, along with the other Hall of Famers, please allow me a few minutes  to honor and pay tribute to my dear mother, whom I love so very much.  Please indulge me for a couple of minutes.  All right.  Let's go.  Thank you in advance for your patience and your understanding, because it means a lot 
[01:02:00]  to me.  I promise I won't be too long, and I hope I don't bore you.  Wrong on both accounts.  Oh, boy.  Just say it.  Now, my story and background is not that unique.  My upbringing is not so different from many others.  But who knows?  Somebody might be inspired.  Inspired?  And maybe some wayward teenager just might find his way back home. 
[01:02:30]  Say pity the fool and shut up.  That's why I want to talk about my mother.  My mother.  I thank God for my mother, because I have seven brothers and four sisters.  What does that mean?  And my mother.  The vagina is huge.  Raised all of us by herself.  Of course she did.  Surprise, surprise.  That's it.  That's it.  That's all we got.  That wasn't 25 minutes.  That wasn't bad.  Thanks, Sam.  Ruining the show long distance.  I want to apologize in advance. 
[01:03:00]  This is why I said we wait until tomorrow when I can pull clips, as opposed to just finding  anything on YouTube and just playing it.  Well, we...  My mother's vagina like the Lincoln Tunnel.  She had 18 kids.  Did Backlund win yesterday?  Bob Backlund did not wrestle.  Why?  They should have him knee walk all over The Undertaker.  Oh, my God. 
[01:03:30]  If you watch the Hall of Fame, there was one shot during the pre-show where they showed  what was going on next to the stage, and it was Bob Backlund grabbing me by the shoulders.  Oh.  And fucking you in the ass.  No, in the mouth.  Sam was kneeling.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, there you go.  Sam, two other...  He wanted to come out of his tuck shoes.  Two other things.  Paul in Jersey says when The Undertaker came out, they had caskets for everyone he's beaten,  right?  Yeah.  And one was for the big boss man who's actually dead.  Oh.  And Paul in Jersey thought that was kind of funny. 
[01:04:00]  That is funny.  Thoughts?  The big boss man.  I mean, the big boss man did unfortunately perish in real life, but he was represented as  he should have been, as somebody who's The Undertaker beat.  But I don't think that...  It's not an unhappy ending for The Undertaker.  Why?  Because he can...  When you can wrestle Brock Lesnar again at another pay-per-view and make another big payday.  How much do you think he makes?  For a match?  Yeah. 
[01:04:30]  Seven figures.  Come on.  No way.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I was following you on Instagram over the weekend.  Your picture with Bruno San Martino was deeply disturbing.  That's a good one.  I didn't realize how old Bruno San Martino got.  I like that one.  He's a little long in the tooth.  Boy, is he.  Did you meet The Rock?  I mean, The Undertaker?  There's Bruno.  Look at that.  I saw him again.  I didn't ask him for a photo, though.  Why?  I was backstage at the Hall of Fame, and he was busy.  Oh, okay. 
[01:05:00]  Did you want to say hi to him?  Sam knows.  No, I didn't want to bug him.  He was on the way up to...  Unlike Jimmy.  Yeah, exactly.  Hey, I've showed tremendous restraint.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right, Sam.  Anything else?  It was a wonderful time we've had by all.  What are you doing right now?  Laying in bed.  Oh, that must be nice.  Are you coming back today?  I'm coming back this afternoon.  What time's your flight?  Any other things to do down there for wrestling? 
[01:05:30]  Uh, I mean, I could stay and watch Raw tonight.  What?  You should.  I've got to go back to work.  No.  Fucking let you take it back.  Who cares?  Yeah, watch Raw.  See you in a few weeks.  Yep.  I got to go to the WrestleMania after party.  Oh, how was that?  It's fucking awesome.  It's a whole bunch of wrestlers partying.  Wow.  Yeah.  Do they all know you? 
[01:06:00]  Yeah, they do at this point.  Oh, Jesus.  I don't like your fucking sideburns.  I just saw a photo of you with John Cena.  Your sideburns.  They're not even sideburns.  They're fucking payous.  No.  They're tendrils.  They're fucking little chew curls.  What is that?  Did you do that on purpose?  No.  No.  I was pointed out to me, but I did not do that on purpose.  Oh.  Curl just fell.  Yeah, Curl fell.  Fucking Sammy Temple.  Yeah.  Oy.  Oy vey.  Nice picture with the... 
[01:06:30]  Who's that with his fucking...  John Cena.  John Cena with his arm around you?  Yeah.  I've got a lot going on this weekend, you know?  Oh, man.  With the WrestleMania background, it's almost like legitimate press.  Right.  All right, Sam.  Except for that background.  Amazing stuff, Sam.  Thank you.  Step one.  There's a chick.  That's, um...  She's on that Cougar Town show.  Yeah.  Oh.  She's lovely.  Oh, Busy Phillips.  Busy Phillips?  Busy Phillips.  No one's name is Busy.  No.  Stupid.  No.  All right, can we go now, Sam? 
[01:07:00]  Did you see I got to hang out with Cowhead?  Who's Cowhead?  Cowhead.  Who is this guy?  Is that him?  Work the radio.  We know him.  He's a big wrestling fan.  Is that Cowhead right there?  No, that's not him.  No.  I don't know who that is.  Oh, E.  He doesn't have a photo of it on here.  Yeah, where's your Cowhead photo?  Go to Twitter.  Oh, Twitter.  Oh, so, see, you didn't think Cowhead was good enough for your Instagram.  All right.  Nope. 
[01:07:30]  I do that, too.  It's a retweet.  I understand that.  I do that, too.  Good enough for a tweet.  Some pictures are just good for Twitter, but not good enough for my Instagram.  Is that Cowhead?  I've never seen that guy in my life.  Is he thinner than he used to be?  Sam?  Oh, yeah.  I don't know if you see him.  He's about the same.  He didn't look like he was thinner, but I don't know.  Why are you pointing stupidly in that photo?  I don't know.  I don't see the photo.  Okay.  Well, you're pointing.  And you retweet it, so you know what photo we're talking about.  Exactly. 
[01:08:00]  I probably didn't know what to do with my hands.  Maybe that's it.  Ah.  Good one.  I would say set up a ladder.  Grab a rope.  One of the things you can do with your hands.  All right, Sam.  Glad you had fun at WrestleMania.  We'll see you back here tomorrow or maybe Wednesday, depending if you go to Raw tonight.  I'll be back tomorrow.  All right.  He's got a wife.  He can't just be fucking darting around.  Why?  They can take care of themselves?  Yeah, I don't know.  Can they really? 
[01:08:30]  Why do women need us to fucking, for their fun?  All right, Sam.  All right, thanks.  All right.  Sam Roberts live from New Orleans.  Or New Orleans.  His name, don't wear it out.  Thank you.  Shocking news from the Superdome.  Yeah.  It's Undertaker lost.  That is shocking.  We're going to have to check the blogs later.  Yeah, what's it already saying?  Oh, I don't know.  The eyes, mouth, or a gape.  The shirt.  It's the Hulkster t-shirt. 
[01:09:00]  You wouldn't wear that?  With the WrestleMania sweatshirt over it.  Oh, is he all in?  I think we're in.  With a juvenile fucking form of entertainment.  You don't like the fucking Hulk shirt with the yellow?  I think we're all trying to hang out to some kind of youth or whatever, but I think with  wrestling stuff, is he coming back in?  Ant thinks you're too old for wrestling stuff.  Well, I don't know.  You can play with drones and Xbox, so it's in the same category.  That's cool stuff. 
[01:09:30]  No, that's kind of cool stuff.  That's cool stuff.  I don't know.  I think there is a shelf life on wearing wrestling things.  I just feel like it.  I'm sure once I have kids or 40 hits, this is going to have to go away.  Let me see the shirt that you're wearing.  It's yellow.  Oh, it's the Hulkamania.  It's all wrinkled.  Bright yellow with the red Hulkamania across it, and then over it, he's got a hoodie at  WrestleMania 12 hoodie.  From Miami, yeah.  From Miami, oh.  That's 2012.  You didn't get the new hoodie?  No, I did not.  Why?  Did you tell Sam to pick you up some swag? 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  Really?  But I did not.  I hope he does.  I didn't like the current hoodie.  Do you have like Undertaker figures in the house?  No, I have nothing on Undertaker.  Undertaker?  No.  No, yeah, I don't know.  I caught myself.  Undertaker.  You don't have any Undertaker stuff?  No.  Why?  I just never did.  How's your bronchitis?  It's better.  Let's hope it's gone, as you're sitting here at the mic talking to us.  Right.  It's past the point of being contagious, so I'm good. 
[01:10:30]  All right.  I'm still bronchitis.  I got bronchitis.  We'll take a break.  We've been talking forever.  All right.  Do you want to talk about the other matches at WrestleMania?  No.  Had Fandong go-go do.  He did not wrestle.  Why?  Isn't he a big shot still?  That heat's gone.  Yeah, a little bit.  His heat's gone that fast?  Well, I don't know if it just went away or if they kind of squashed it, but after last  year's WrestleMania, it was huge.  Oh, I know.  We all know that.  It went for a while.  Yeah.  But then, you know, now the big thing is Daniel Bryan and the Yes Movement. 
[01:11:00]  Oh, boy.  What's the Yes Movement?  That is.  When he comes out and good things happen.  I've seen all good people turn their heads.  Not that Yes Movement.  I'm so satisfied.  That's different Yes.  I'm on my way.  Yeah.  What does he do?  He puts his hands up in the air and just goes, Yes.  Run around.  Yes.  Yes.  What does that mean?  And then the whole crowd does it and you get like 50,000 people shouting Yes.  They did it at the college sports games and all that stuff, too.  Oh, this is just...  Oh, my God.  He's going to sell a lot of T-shirts. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, he already has.  God, am I jealous.  And now that he's champion, he won last night.  Both matches.  Terrific.  Both matches?  What do you mean both?  Twice.  This guy's busy.  He had to fight twice?  He had to wrestle Triple H.  And if he beat Triple H, he got to go to the main event and do a three-way match there.  Why don't they decide that before WrestleMania?  Why do they make everyone work extra hard?  Got to build suspense.  Oh, God.  Build a story.  Did you snack while you watched it? 
[01:12:00]  Oh, yes, I did.  How did you snack?  What's the kind of snacking you thought?  Oh, no.  No.  What'd you have?  Cock?  What kind of snacks?  I made a big dinner.  Right?  Why does it take him so long to get out of the cage?  I don't understand.  I don't know, but that wasn't part of WrestleMania last night.  Who's that guy with the beard?  That's Daniel Bryan, though.  Oh, doing the Yes?  That's the Yes movie.  That's great.  I've been doing that since 1974 on stage.  Ozzy. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah, he's ripping off Ozzy.  Of course he is.  What does that mean, though?  What does the Yes thing mean?  How long do you do it for an hour?  He's just showing support for Daniel Bryan and the guys that don't get a big push because  WWE likes the big, huge dudes and lets them get all the opportunities.  Okay, so this is a younger guy, a smaller guy, getting a chance to compete at the Menlo.  That's his gimmick, huh?  What do you mean getting a chance?  How do I do it for an hour?  His arms just go up.  Yay, yay, boom.  What about CM Punk? 
[01:13:00]  CM Punk's gone.  But what's he going to do?  Nobody knows.  His contract's up in July, but he walked out in January.  Do you think that was a real walkout or maybe he had a surgery and he'll have a big return?  He was on the early artwork for WrestleMania 30.  He was part of it.  And all of a sudden, they pulled him off everything.  So what I'm saying is, do you think maybe it's a work because he might have had a surgery  so they're like, hey, leave and then come back?  Yeah, let's make it sound like you hate us and we'll figure all this out.  If they did, that's brilliant, but there's too much money involved with his face on everything. 
[01:13:30]  Like, they don't sell most of his merch anymore.  Like, they'll show one little thing at the merch stands, but he was making tons of money  just on the merchandise alone.  And now he's nowhere on the website or on the WrestleMania stuff.  I think we're still talking about wrestling.  I know.  I'm stunned.  I'm amazed we're still talking about wrestling.  Yeah.  We're talking about CM Punk.  We love CM Punk.  Yeah.  All right, Iraq.  That was wonderful.  And then there was...  Okay, Iraq.  Thank you.  The Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, boy.  That happened.  How about Jericho?  Did he fight?  Jericho's not in WWE right now.  Why?  He did a little stint and then went back to touring with his band again.  Okay.  That Fozzy thing is taking a long time.  He's a rock star now.  They're good.  It's huge everywhere but in this country.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All over Asia, Europe, South America.  Yep.  Comes back, does a little stint, does some autograph signings, and then becomes a rock star again.  That is so cool for him.  Good for Chris.  All right, we're going to take a break.  We've got Morgan Spurlock coming in today. 
[01:14:30]  He's got a CNN show.  Yeah.  That's very good.  Inside Man.  Yes.  So we'll talk about that.  What, you found a clip from Vice's Scrapping?  Why is that up there?  That's the guy explaining it.  Oh.  Yeah, maybe we'll play that for the people.  And then there was another guy that wants to talk about scrapping.  If Richie's still...  Hold on.  Let me do this.  Richie.  Oh, he's gone now.  Oh, we're about to go home.  Whatever.  Where's Richie?  All right, we'll be back.  And where's Roland going? 
[01:15:00]  He just turned us on to some Bruce Springsteen, and then he walks down the hall.  Morning, everyone.  Meh, meh, meh, meh, meh.  Good morning.  That Scrapping guy's back.  I want to say hi to Richie in Staten Island.  Richie.  Hey, how's it going?  We're talking about scrapping.  Scrapping, yeah.  I'm working at the scrapyard in Jersey City for the last nine years.  Yeah.  Operator.  Yeah.  We started primarily doing cars. 
[01:15:30]  You know, we've been up cars for all the precious metals and whatnot.  Over the last five years, he started doing scrap metal.  Went out, purchased a shredder, a shredding plant.  And, you know, the printing material that we put out, we have buyers from pretty much all over the world.  But primarily what you guys said, the Chinese are buying up everything.  We have, you know, actually, it's really more like the word handles.  I mean, Chinese, Korea, Japanese, for some reason, they seem to be, you know, pretty much buying up all of our stuff. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  And it's just kind of amazing how the scrap business is kind of boomed because we have people who come in with pickup trucks,  who will load it up with anything that they see on, like, garbage day, you know, throughout the streets.  Right.  And literally have 20, 30 pickups, you know, making four, four or five trips a day, you know, making whatever it is that they're making. 
[01:16:30]  It's like a new industry.  Sure.  Yeah.  I mean, but it's just amazing because, like, say, like, like we say, the summertime, last couple of years, it's been, you know, very hot, 100 degrees plus, whatever.  And we get more air conditioners in that you wouldn't think that people would be thrown out and shit.  Oh, I love scrap metal.  Yeah, but I think it's, I find it kind of fascinating because you're right.  It's like a, it's a booming industry.  It's not a new industry, but it's certainly, certainly taking off lately. 
[01:17:00]  And it's, it's kind of nice that, you know, a lot of our garbage is going away because that stuff, when we were growing up, just laid around in yards and this and that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I guess when the economy is a little shitty, it probably gets, uh, also the problem is, you know,  you go into your new house and turn on the water and you got a flood because somebody in the middle of the night took all your pipes.  Took your fucking copper pipes.  Fuck, wads.  Because some of that is happening, too.  Yeah, yeah.  But, you know, there's so much competition out there that the people, people don't just wait for, say, like, garbage today. 
[01:17:30]  They'll actually go out and, and make their own scrap, per se.  I just don't understand.  Like, you see an old air conditioner.  Why is that valuable?  Copper inside it.  Oh, you got copper, you got the, uh, ACR and stuff.  It's, it's money.  Yeah.  It's money in the bank.  They will scrap friggin' anything.  And if, people, people will, will, will mix, well, which we don't particularly like, but they'll mix, you know, plastics in with metals. 
[01:18:00]  You know, if it's got a sliver of friggin' metal, they'll, they'll, they'll try and scrap it.  It's just, it's just amazing.  It's got a lot of scrap.  Yeah.  It's fascinating.  The whole life is scrap.  But I, I find it, uh, you know, and then you got the Chinese coming in and making these deals with you guys.  Oh, yeah.  And how do you guys, how do you guys, how do you guys, how do you guys set the prices?  Well, it, it, it goes, it goes by, uh, I guess, I guess, I actually don't know.  I mean, there's got to be something driving, driving metals. 
[01:18:30]  I mean, I know, uh, on the, uh, commodity market, as far as aluminum and the copper goes, how, how that works.  But, uh, scrap metal or metal steel, I have no idea.  Because, as far as I know, there's no market for it.  You know, so I, I don't know what drives it up.  And then what do they do, Anthony?  They just melt that shit down and mow some new stuff?  In China.  Yeah, see, we, we, we, we have, we have exporters who'll come in and, and we'll ship directly to them.  And then all of our other surplus will, will send up to big plants, like upstate New York. 
[01:19:00]  And, and they'll actually refine it down.  They'll melt it down and then they'll ship it to wherever their buyers are.  All right.  What is this, what is this clip?  China's ghost towns.  Yeah, China builds all these, like, weird fucking towns for, like, their, their voyeuristic, uh, ways.  What do you mean?  They, like, they'll build, like, Paris in the middle of China.  In the middle of China.  You turn that a little stuff?  Sure.  For some dumb reason.  By the way, that's how someone should turn the monitor.  Thank you, sir.  Oh, man, right? 
[01:19:30]  But why are they doing that?  They, they just, they have money to spend.  Because they can.  Old English phone booths.  Right.  Right.  It's like they made Epcot.  I don't know, it's a water glass.  So when you go there, is there anything inside of these not to show?  No, no, they're just, yeah, they're just, like, fake buildings.  Facades.  Facades.  How odd.  It's like Epcot.  Disney World.  All right.  All right, Richie.  Thank you, man.  All right, Scrap Guy.  I appreciate it.  I want to go to China.  Do you guys mind if I plug my job?  Oh, boy. 
[01:20:00]  Go ahead, man.  I'm sorry.  I don't, I wouldn't normally, but I'm, I'm bucking for a raise.  Oh.  Go ahead.  All right.  We, I work at the county auto-wreckers in Jersey City, New Jersey.  Jersey City.  All right.  Yeah, and they pay the highest prices for scrap metal.  Right.  All right.  Right, which is scrap metal.  Thank you.  Thank you, buddy.  Hey, Liz, for scrap metal.  Thank you very much.  Bye, buddy.  Enjoy, guys.  All right.  I'm an engineer for a cell phone company.  Scrapping is costing us a lot of money.  Wow.  Why?  Let's go to Joe in Chicago.  Joe. 
[01:20:30]  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hello, Joseph.  Hey, well, yeah.  Right now, I'm just finishing up doing all the 4G upgrades for all these cell sites, and  what I have to do is go to all the sites to make sure the construction companies did what  they're supposed to have done.  And about 85% of them, you know, it started off them just stealing the copper bus bars for,  you know, lightning protection and stuff like that.  Now what they're doing is they're going into the AC units, ripping out the copper for that,  and they even have a couple of sites where they're killing the power at the power lines 
[01:21:00]  and taking that thick odd gauge wire from the actual power pole and ripping out hundreds  of meters of this stuff.  Yeah, some people get electrocuted.  It's hilarious.  So they find people dead, like, on the side of a telephone pole, and, you know, they thought  the power was off when it was on, or it was off, but the wire fell on power lines that  were on, and they wind up getting fucking zapped.  Unfortunately, I haven't had any of those yet. 
[01:21:30]  Unfortunately, yeah.  So they're scrapping your towers.  They're scrapping.  We're at the point on the south side of Chicago where it's costing us too much to maintain them.  Yes.  It's what?  It's costing us too much to maintain them.  It's costing us too much to maintain them to have to go back and put all new copper in.  We're just thinking about taking the towers down.  Wow.  Twerks to death.  Amazing.  Is that guy really getting zapped?  Guy twerks to death on power lines.  Oh, my God.  So that's why everybody's cell phones are going up and up and up. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, boy.  Oh, he's kidding.  Come on.  Wait.  Was he feeling something, you think?  Like, was he feeling something?  I don't know.  Was that real?  Sorry.  I think the second he touched that one line went to the ground.  Right.  That metal line that he touches.  He's fucking around there having fun.  He's twerking.  Oh, he's just fucking around, and then...  Right there.  Oh.  That looked fake.  Oh, it is.  That's fake.  Wait.  Because he fell exactly like he was.  Like, yeah, it was like a still picture of him falling out of frame. 
[01:22:30]  Sure.  Let's see.  Hold on.  It's happened.  If you guys want to see fucked up shit, go to wirelessestimator.com, and you'll see some  gnarly stuff on that site.  It's all...  Everything in the industry.  When you have followed him down with the camera.  Yeah.  Now that you point it out, I was like, I've seen enough of those are real ones.  I've seen real ones.  You see the one with the scaffolding?  The four guys are pushing scaffolding out of this big garage thing, and it hits some overhead  lines, and all four of them get fucking zapped.  They fall.  They start burning. 
[01:23:00]  One catches on fire.  There's smoke everywhere.  What'd they say?  Electricity's crazy.  Huh?  Get over it?  What?  I don't know.  Yeah, that's the one.  They come pushing this fucking scaffolding out.  It's in China or Korea?  There's no sound on it.  They're just like, yeah, here we go.  Big metal scaffolding.  Right.  And they hit a fucking power line with it.  Wow.  That's all it takes, motherfucker.  And then they all just fucking get...  That's gotta be like...  They get stuck to it. 
[01:23:30]  30 feet high at least, right?  Right there, look.  Wow.  That's it.  They're all just looking like they're fucking playing games there.  They all just kind of collapsed.  Oh, that guy's on fire on the left.  Are they dead?  And the one guy's feet are on fire.  The bottom of his feet are burning out.  Yeah.  Oh, they're all dead as shit, yeah.  And he finally just lets go.  He's trying to let go.  But is he trying or is it just...  Well, it contracts your muscles, the electricity, so you'll hold on to something.  Very hard to get off of it.  Oh, my God. 
[01:24:00]  That guy's just on fire.  Put this on our Facebook page.  Look at the amount of smoke coming off.  That one guy just will not let go.  Can you imagine how much electricity goes through you when the fucking bottom of your  feet starts shooting out of electricity?  You're cooked.  That's a live leak, huh?  You make a really fucking amazing resistor.  You just fucking...  Wow.  All that fucking amperage just heating you up.  If he had...  What would he have had to have on his hands to not get zapped like that?  Like rubber gloves?  Or magical gloves, I think.  Rubber gloves would have killed him, too? 
[01:24:30]  I mean, there's nothing.  The power line has to be completely dead and it has to be shielded.  Rubber.  Because you're fucked.  Wow.  If he had those big rubber gloves...  What about big rubber shoes?  Insulate it.  But it could go through.  If the voltage and amperage is high enough, it could go through.  Like, it'll arc through.  Is that why, though, people die?  Because it tightens your muscles up?  Yeah.  You go like...  Your muscles contract.  Why don't they go the other way?  I don't know.  They just contract.  So it's like...  Everything just fucking close.  Your hands close. 
[01:25:00]  Your arms get them tight.  What would happen if somebody...  It's like being tased.  If somebody was getting, like, zapped in a puddle and you ran and did, like, a flying leap  and jumped, knocked them out of the puddle, would that be okay?  Yeah, I've heard of people that have done that.  Really?  They run and hit somebody off of a power line or something like that.  Yeah, I think, like, quick contact, something like that.  I don't know.  I don't know if you'd live or not.  Well, you can...  Yeah, it's happened before in our industry.  You're fucked.  You're burnt. 
[01:25:30]  And the person that got you off, you're burnt, too.  But some people that live, most of them die.  The worst is when you see footage of people...  Someone's daughter, that happened to, where she got out of the car, they were going to  something, and she stepped in the puddle.  And both of them died, I think, right?  Oh, yeah.  There's no way to see that coming.  No.  So.  All right.  Let me move on there, Joe.  Thank you for the phone call.  We're going to go to Dan in Philly.  Dan.  Dan.  Yes, how are you doing, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  I just wanted to give you a quick heads up. 
[01:26:00]  The reason why China buys all their scrap is they don't have a good source of iron ore,  so it's much cheaper for them to buy our stuff and re-melt it than it is.  So we're actually helping them take over the world.  So why don't we make that stuff super expensive?  Make them pay a little bit, finally.  I think they'll just get it from somewhere else.  One of the biggest scrap dealers in the United States is in Newark, and over 80% of their  scrap goes to China because they'll pay more than anybody else will. 
[01:26:30]  So, I mean, it can go anywhere between $300, $600 a ton, and they'll take anything.  I mean, they take motors, and they'll melt the aluminum out of them, and they just get really  cheap steel.  It's easier to melt it in an arc furnace than it is to process it in a blast furnace, which  is taking raw coke and raw iron ore and make it into iron and steel.  Iron coke, chromium steel.  Living here in Allentown, but they're closing all the factories down. 
[01:27:00]  Wow.  Sorry, guys.  Hey, do you think it hurts when you get an electric fuel like that, or are you out quickly?  I bet it hurts.  Ah, for a split second.  How long?  That's what I wonder.  Depends on...  I don't know.  Some people live through it, and they're all fucked up.  Right.  Electricity.  I move shipping containers.  They're loaded with scrap. 
[01:27:30]  I want to talk about the scrap metal.  Let me go to Joey in New York.  Joey.  Hello?  Hey.  Hello?  Hey, guys.  Listen.  Hi.  Excuse me?  Listen, my family is in the steel business, so we've had a family-owned business for over  100 years.  You should buy stuff.  I'm really offended by what you guys are saying.  It's not that bad.  We've got to make money somehow.  So can you stop, please, because of the harassment and the bad name-calling that you called the  steel and the scrap metal community?  We're harassing the scrap metal community.  Well, you're giving it a bad name. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah.  It's not nice.  I hear you.  Okay.  He's goofing.  He's goofing around.  You broke weed, dude.  Did you ever drink beers in school?  What's the matter with you?  I bet you never rip bongs in high school.  Rip some bong hits.  Right?  Check out the empties, man.  Man.  See you right now, bro.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  There he goes.  There's a video of an Indian guy electrocuting himself that you have to see. 
[01:28:30]  You saw that one, right?  The guy on the top of the train?  That's a good one.  The one on the top of the train is really good.  Oh, yeah.  There's a crowded train there.  He's standing on the roof.  This dummy.  He grabs the power line or something.  Why would you?  Well, because they ride on top of the trains in India.  Of course they do.  But why grab the power line?  Yeah, that was a dumb move.  I bet he thought that same question right when he did it.  Yeah.  Oh.  Why did I do that?  He touches it and it instantly blows out. 
[01:29:00]  Two big blasts.  Then you got a guy just walking away with his luggage like...  He's on fire.  His head's on fire.  Yeah.  That sound of pure fucking electricity.  Bump.  That's a fast death.  Oh, yeah.  He's done.  That's a fucking...  His balls were smoking.  You see that? 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  Smokey balls.  Damn.  But he was really walking like he knew what he was doing up there.  Oh, yeah.  He's like, oh, let me grab this.  Bump.  We've seen the guys flown in by helicopters, by the way, Matt.  We've done that.  Oh, yeah.  Those big, huge power lines where they drop them down.  Yeah, and then they got to work on them and inspect them.  So they put them on top of the power lines by helicopter.  But they got to, like, take that stick and touch the wire with it so they could kind of equal out. 
[01:30:00]  Right.  I still wouldn't do that.  Can't you feel the electricity going through you when you're there?  I don't know.  Oh, I don't want to do this job.  They're wearing these weird outfits and the helicopter just kind of goes and...  I think these guys laugh at laptops on their groins.  You know what I mean?  Not only is it, like, electricity and shit, but they're so fucking high up.  Yeah, and they just get out and sit on the fucking wires. 
[01:30:30]  He's sitting on the fucking wire with a helicopter right next to it.  Well, what is he going to do?  Inspect the wires, fucking do any repairs.  Why don't you just go back and go, ah, we inspected the wires.  It looked good.  Yeah, it looked great.  It looked great.  They put these little wooden benches that they clip on the wire so they could sit.  It's just fucking high.  And then what are they going to do?  Now the, uh...  Are they going to move down the wire?  See, they got to get the helicopter away now.  And they keep the wire attached to the helicopter, right?  Until the helicopter goes away far enough. 
[01:31:00]  You see that arc comes off of it?  Because they don't want it arcing.  And hitting the helicopter?  And hitting the helicopter or hitting them or...  Yeah.  How do they figure that out?  Exactly.  Who was the first one that said, I have an idea.  This might work.  Get in the helicopter.  What?  Yeah, take metal.  Touch the wire.  You'll get on and I'll fly away.  That would be great.  You know how many helicopters must have got arced and fucking fallen before someone said,  let us get a little farther out.  It's O&A Show on Facebook.  All these videos we pop up there for you.  So, the ones we see during the show.  Science!  Uh, let's go to Bill in Georgia. 
[01:31:30]  Bill?  Oh, Bill.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  We haul these shipping containers and we go into these scrap metal yards.  They take all that shit that everybody turns in and they just grind it up into little pieces.  And the guy just takes up like a front-end loader, you know, like a bobcat loader,  and just fills the shit out of these things with just garbage.  I mean, look, it's got pieces of foam rubber and just whatever they grind up.  That's been alleged.  Yeah.  Yeah, I've seen it. 
[01:32:00]  These shipping containers literally look like they're filled with garbage.  It's garbage.  And it's extremely valuable.  Yeah.  And China's eating it up.  Yeah, yeah.  The other thing that they're doing down here in Georgia is we have, you know, a lot of agriculture.  So, these fields have the irrigation systems on them.  They call them a pivot.  It's got like a wellhead.  Oh, no.  And then it's got like a sprinkler system.  It's like a mile long, you know, and it's got every hundred feet.  There's a drive tire that has a motor on it that turns that tire.  These guys are going out in the fields and stealing all the copper wire off of these pivots. 
[01:32:30]  They go to those drive motors, and they're hauling out miles with this wire.  And the farmer goes out there, you know, and his shit's all tore up.  Poor farmer.  Yeah, those things are hundreds of thousands of dollars.  No shit.  Yeah, they're just chopping the wire out of it.  To give to China.  What are we doing?  Yeah, yeah.  China.  What the fuck are we doing?  We had a guy get killed at the scrapyard here with that security guard guarding the shit at night.  And a guy came in there and stole the whole bale that was already crushed into a bale of copper.  And he shot the guard, and they caught him. 
[01:33:00]  And the reason he shot the guard was the fucker worked at the scrapyard, and the guard knew him.  So on his way out, he killed him.  So he wouldn't have to grant him out.  Wow.  Good strategy anyway.  And someone else is saying scrap is a commodity.  Trade it every day now.  Oh.  I did not know that.  It must be.  It's big business.  All right, Bill.  Thank you.  All right, man.  See you.  And you know the guys from China with the scaffolding?  Yeah.  Brian has a little more on that.  Brian.  That's he.  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Hey.  Yeah, I know you guys are just watching the video, but if you go a little further, one 
[01:33:30]  guy gets up, gets zapped again, and then gets up and kind of walks off the screen and  goes through a door.  No.  Come on.  I swear.  No, you're thinking of a different video.  Not on that one.  I know the video he's thinking of, and that ain't it.  But there was a lot more to this video, so there's no way one of these guys got up,  so he just zipped to himself.  No.  I know which one you're talking about.  The guy gets, like, zapped.  He gets struck by lightning or something.  And then he gets up, walks a little further, gets zapped again. 
[01:34:00]  The guys are on fire.  So they're on fire.  He's better on fire.  Look at the guys on fire.  He already get up and fucking put his shoes on, getting his shoes on.  All right, but let's play it out just in case.  These guys are on fire.  Four guys doing nothing.  They're still napping, sir.  Next one.  Next one.  We're going, we're fast-forwarding here.  I don't see.  Oh, the other guy's now on fire.  You couldn't find four deader guys.  Sir, these are the four deadest men in history.  Sir, no one got up.  Yeah, no one. 
[01:34:30]  No one.  Using them as Yule logs.  Yes, he's on fire.  Four smoldering employees.  Right.  And by the way, not even twitching when he's on fire, which usually shows that you're not alive.  You might be wrong on that one, sir.  I think you're wrong, sir.  Yeah.  Thank you, sir.  They were killed in a horrible way.  Completely killed.  Yeah.  When your heels are shooting fire, you have zero chance of getting up.  From your hands, and it travels all the way through and burns out the bottom of your feet.  Yeah, yeah.  You are fucking doomed. 
[01:35:00]  You're done.  So, Roland's back in studio because he turned us on to some Springsteen shenanigans.  What the hell's going on with Springsteen?  Well, we got the NCAA final game tonight.  Yeah.  And they have all the top artists play for free.  Hold on, though.  I want to say that Justin Stengel's the only one in America that's got a perfect bracket  still.  Ooh.  Yep.  Oh, yeah.  So.  No billion dollars?  I don't know if he decided not to do the Warren Buffett one, unfortunately. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah, because he said that the money would spoil him.  Mm-hmm.  True.  He doesn't want to change.  Justin Stengel is getting a lot of heat.  A lot of big news outlets are interviewing him over his perfect bracket.  And the final game is tonight against UConn and Kentucky.  Who does he have?  I don't know.  I've got to ask him.  My Kentucky shirts?  I've been all about UConn this entire season.  Shabazz?  By the way.  Oh, yeah.  Shabazz.  Nice.  I've been all about UConn.  So I say just throw it all.  If you've got some cash on you, just put it all on UConn.  UConn beating a lot of good teams, man. 
[01:36:00]  Oh, yeah.  Teams they weren't supposed to beat.  That's it.  And now they're saying they don't even have a chance against Kentucky.  University of Connecticut.  Oh.  Word disturbs me.  The Entenman's Badminton Competition in Connecticut.  Playing badminton and eating Entenman's in Connecticut. 
[01:36:30]  What is that?  Just take the N out of Entenman's.  Make it Entenman's.  Just say Entenman's.  Entenman's.  Entenman's.  Not Entenman's.  Entenman's.  Entenman's.  Did you eat that coffee cake that guy brought over?  No.  He's still alive, isn't he?  I did.  How was it?  It was fucking great.  The shit gut's not going to take care of itself.  Got to make some...  I had a little piece right out of the middle.  Did you? 
[01:37:00]  Oh, you're killing me.  I took a knife and cut a square right out of the middle because I'm a grown-up and I  can do that now without getting yelled at.  How good was it?  It was so good.  Oh, God, I love it.  It was that perfect, like, cinnamon-y taste of crumb cake.  It was so goddamn good.  Yeah.  Oh.  What'd you put on there?  Nothing.  I just ate it right there.  I like to pour on crumb cake.  I like to pour olive oil and capers.  That would be really bad. 
[01:37:30]  This mudslide of flesh isn't going to...  Remove itself.  Oh, my God.  I've got to make some decisions.  Oh, man.  I'm all in.  Yeah.  I'm all in to get back in shape.  But anyway, so Springsteen played what?  A full show for free.  At least streamed it last night.  Two hours and 40 minutes, you're telling me?  What?  Yeah, they got this big...  You know, because the final four games were Saturday and now the big game's tonight.  Why would he do that?  Like, what's Bruce's... 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  Look, Bruce doesn't need fucking exposure.  But for a new audience, though.  No, he could sell out arenas for multiple nights on end.  He's done it.  Everyone knows who Bruce is.  Everyone knows what he's all about.  There's not anyone that needs...  Exposure.  To see Bruce to go like, oh, is that Bruce?  The younger audience, though.  But also it's a different band.  It's with Tom Morello, now with Little Steven.  Is Bruce the guy that's singing the song?  Is Bruce playing guitar?  Yes.  Is Little Steven there?  No.  I think that makes a good point. 
[01:38:30]  I think this guy is probably bored with his life and has nothing else going on for himself.  So he forces his poor band to do two-hour and 40-minute concerts on a Sunday night.  Gratis.  It's a three-day music festival.  No, I know.  I bet it's also for the young audience.  Yeah, it's all the college kids.  Very smart.  He probably sells so many fucking records like that.  He's smart.  He's a billionaire.  I'm with Ed.  Relax.  Enjoy your life a little bit.  Amazing.  He likes to do.  For free.  He likes singing.  He can't like singing Rosalita again.  He didn't.  Oh.  But he opened up with a new song, though. 
[01:39:00]  He opened up with a new song.  There you go.  The cover.  We got it queued up?  Yeah.  Does he tell a little story?  Wait.  He's got a basketball.  He gives the ref the basketball.  It's a guitar tech.  It's kind of douchey.  He puts a guitar on.  Where's the same outfit in every show?  Oh, no.  They're going to do a jump ball between two guitars.  Why are they jump balling?  And then they hit it into the crowd.  And now they're playing jump? 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  Why are they hitting the ball?  Because there's jump.  It's basketball.  They jump.  Who's that dude?  That's his wife.  That's who?  That's his wife.  Oh, that one.  Miss Calford.  I thought it was Nick Cannon doing a cameo.  The one that stole away from his other chick back in the day.  The one that was in the video.  He blew off the hot chick.  Yeah.  For the, uh...  You know.  How long is this intro? 
[01:40:00]  Nice.  Sounds like a high school version.  Oh, no.  It sucked.  That sucked.  This is terrible.  Ha, ha.  Oh, no.  What about wearing hats?  Where is this?  Dallas.  It's cold.  Oh, it must be freezing.  Oh, this is awful.  I gotta hear the hook, though. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, yeah.  I should have heard Patrick Stewart.  Patrick Stewart on keyboard.  Do you like this?  No.  This is horrible.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Why is it in there?  Come on.  It's not what happens.  Does he jump or not? 
[01:41:00]  Was that Warren Haynes playing with him?  No.  This guy looked like Warren.  It just stops there.  Sal just makes this decision that we've heard enough.  Oh, there it goes.  Oh, God.  That is Warren Haynes, right?  On the left?  Yeah.  He's got a fat guy in his band.  Yeah.  It's Charlie.  He plays that.  Wow.  Charlie!  That was really exquisitely bad.  I didn't care for that. 
[01:41:30]  In the other concert, he covered Lord Royal.  Really?  Yeah.  Was that good?  Oh, yeah.  I like all his covers.  No.  I wouldn't mind a cover.  That was a horrible cover.  Come on, Roland.  I know you love Bruce.  That was really bad.  But fuck, you've got to just go, you know.  That was terrible.  No, it was, yeah, it was... 
[01:42:00]  I don't know this song.  You know this song?  I don't.  Who sings it?  Lord.  You know the original. 
[01:42:30]  There's no way you don't know the original.  Let me hear the original.  I don't know it.  Sorry.  This is fucked.  Why is he doing this?  He's got eight million songs.  That people want to hear him sing.  He's doing, like, rare covers of different things.  It's awful.  And everybody that's at this show wants to hear a hit.  Not some fucking cover piece of shit from Bruce doing it poorly.  I want to hear fucking Tunnel of Love.  In this tunnel of love. 
[01:43:00]  Into the tunnel of love.  Give me a point to run.  Maybe we were born to run.  Come on, Wendy.  Can you play the original for Jimmy?  He knows Lord Royals.  Oh.  Springsteen did a horrible job with this song.  She's like the 17-year-old New Zealand chick?  Yeah.  Or wherever she's from.  With the curly hair.  This is good.  She's finally cute for two seconds in a video. 
[01:43:30]  And then.  Yeah, they've cleaned her up nice.  She's brutal looking.  Wow.  Is that her?  Yeah.  Nice fat rump, though.  She's a little dumpy.  Wouldn't mind spanking her.  Oh, my God.  She hugs Jen from War.  She doesn't have a hint of a shape on her body.  Yeah.  The actual name was Lard.  Wow. 
[01:44:00]  Ryo!  I got to hear the Honey Bee part.  I got to hear the Honey Bee part.  Let me be your ruler.  Ruler.  You can call me Queen Bee.  Or Queen Bee.  What does she have?  What's she have?  Booler?  Ugh.  That might be...  Whoa!  Fuck!  Wait a minute!  What is that?  They turned her ass around on purpose, right?  No, that's a real photo.  That's not a real photo.  What is that? 
[01:44:30]  Wait a minute.  Those are the Grammys.  She has big thighs.  That doesn't make sense.  No, I can't make that out.  Nah, someone's fucking around.  That's her ass.  No, because that would be a horrible ass.  They turned her body around, right?  That's a real photo.  Is that real?  Yeah.  I'm trying to figure it out.  I can't figure out what's going on there.  Nah, someone's fucking around.  Everyone has that.  It's like she's got those giant balls.  Thunder thighs.  Yeah?  Thunder thighs?  I don't know. 
[01:45:00]  That's a weird picture.  That's not real.  That's her ass.  They just flipped the picture.  Or she's wearing Spanx.  She might have like one of those gun things.  I don't know what the fuck that is, but I want no part of it.  Breaking news.  Yeah?  People are...  Can you turn this off?  People are saying that the guy absolutely gets up.  Everyone's tweeting me that, too.  He does not get up.  We saw the end of it, dumbbells.  They're saying he gets up, like...  I think he goes back down, but I think he gets up for a little bit. 
[01:45:30]  Which guy?  Is everyone looking at the same video?  No, they're not.  They're saying around four minutes in.  Come on.  No one's been on fire for four minutes and then gets up.  What the fuck's wrong with you people?  How long is the video?  You went a little before the four minutes, right?  Okay.  Where are we at now?  3.55.  3.55.  Let's see if anyone gets up.  Let's see.  You can't see through the smoke of burning people if someone's getting up.  It's very difficult to see because people are on fire.  Which guy is the same does? 
[01:46:00]  Is it the same video?  No.  They have to be talking about another video.  Could someone give us the time stamp on where the guy gets up and walks?  He doesn't get up.  They're all so dead.  Then he comes back and he missed it.  We're looking at a forest fire.  Who is getting up?  No one is getting up.  Where's the time stamp?  Yeah, where?  Hold on.  Let me go to Jim in Virginia.  Jim, you're representing a lot of people.  Absolutely.  At four minutes to 11 seconds.  Oh, wow.  All right.  There's a plane between them. 
[01:46:30]  That guy got up.  I'm wrong.  Wait, go back.  The one guy got up.  Which guy?  The guy right there.  On the far left is where the two people are laying down together.  That guy.  Oh, wow.  But I didn't see the two guys laying down.  I saw this.  I can't believe it.  We're wrong.  He's the one that nothing was arcing on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  It's the only guy that nothing was arcing on.  But wasn't that other guy's shoes on fire?  Yes.  See, look.  There he goes.  He gets up.  He gets zapped again. 
[01:47:00]  And he runs out.  Did he come back?  And take up his position in the fucking smoldering?  Yeah.  What happened?  What do you think happened?  Holy fuck.  You guys are right.  Did he happen to let go immediately?  Can you go back to the beginning?  Yeah.  Go to the beginning.  Let's see what happened to him.  Did he just drop it?  Like, I just assumed it was those three guys.  Wait.  There's only three guys.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hold on a minute.  Play this.  What the fuck?  Huh?  Watch it from the top.  I thought there were four.  What happened?  That one guy wasn't there in the... 
[01:47:30]  Yeah, the one guy wasn't there.  It was four guys.  One, two, three...  There's one in the back.  Four.  Three...  Four.  There's four guys.  All right.  There's the four guys.  Okay.  They turn this fucking thing around, and then all hell breaks loose.  You know, this one guy is holding out...  They're all holding out with both hands.  He's on it for a fucking minute, man.  He's hanging on there.  Wait a minute.  But where does that guy come from?  Yeah, because he...  He ends up over there next to the other guy.  Maybe he tries to get up and falls back down. 
[01:48:00]  We were too busy laughing and pointing.  Yes.  Wow.  But he let go first before anybody.  Got his hands on fire.  Yeah, he let go quicker than anyone.  All right.  That guy's burning because he's too close to the pole.  Oh, there's...  Now he just let go.  Holy shit.  That guy's getting like...  But he's getting fired, blasting through his groin.  Yeah, zip through there a little.  Let's just see when this guy gets up and falls again.  Yeah, yeah.  See when he moves over to that other area.  All right.  All right.  There's him.  Wait.  It's that guy. 
[01:48:30]  It's another guy.  Let's see.  All right.  Hold on.  So he gets zapped again.  It's the guy on the left.  We're going to put this...  Why would he duck under it instead of going around it?  Right?  What an asshole.  This video is...  He just got electrocuted, Jim.  Okay, but you still...  No matter how much shock you're in, you don't walk under the electrocution area.  And I think Jim was going for a joke more than anything.  Here he goes.  Wow.  He gets up and he goes under it again.  Why would you do that?  Because he's dumb.  And then he gets...  And he bumps into it again, this fucking clot, and wraps around the metal. 
[01:49:00]  You survived, and he bumps into it.  He walked in and bumped into the metal again.  What a dump.  I'm with Jimmy now.  Why would you bump into it again?  Holy shit.  And now he's down again, and that's why he's in that position.  Now he's only over there.  Right, okay.  I wonder if he's...  Can we follow him up?  Is this guy alive or no?  Nice attentive fucking place this is.  Right.  This human fucking flesh smoke permeating the establishment, and no one comes out to see where it's coming from? 
[01:49:30]  I just figured it was the toy factory.  That was a blank time.  It was a blank time.  He had to go get something to eat.  All right.  What's the story, man?  What's the story, morning glory?  You got anything on this guy there?  No, sir.  I don't have anything.  No, I'm asking the mustache kid.  It says he was crying, this guy.  He was crying for help.  And tell us something we don't know there.  What happened to the guy that walked away?  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:50:00]  That's all you want to know.  Any updates?  These guys were all right.  Hope he was punished for laying down the job.  Exactly.  We would make horrible witnesses.  We're horrible radio hosts.  No, they all died.  Right.  And we're insistent.  Did they?  That guy died?  No, I mean.  Oh, because he banged into the thing again?  Maybe he would have been fucking fine if he didn't bang into it and wrap around more  metal.  Right.  Yeah.  Then he walked off.  They don't really tell you anything.  All right, Jim.  Thank you.  From Virginia.  All right, brother.  Oh.  Bruce is doing these covers for the college kids. 
[01:50:30]  Well, we figured as much.  No, I am.  Jump.  That's from 1983.  Yeah, what the fuck?  Where are you to?  Oh, this guy might have a...  Barry in California.  Barry.  Barry.  Hey, we're back.  Hey.  Hey, I'm a lineman for utility out in California.  We deal with...  Drive the main road?  Oh, the lineman.  Very good.  And basically what's going on is because that's a big metal tower, it's taking most of the brunt  of the electricity going to ground, and they're just basically bleeding off some of it. 
[01:51:00]  That's why that guy was able to get up and walk away.  We've had guys come into contact with 12,000 volts, go through their body, and they live.  Yeah, but the other guys were on fire.  Why did he live, sir?  Because the electric tower, or the...  I'm sorry, the metal tower that they're pushing around, it's taking the brunt of the  force that's taking it to ground.  Oh.  So they're just basically bleeding off a little bit of it.  That's pretty much what it is.  Right. 
[01:51:30]  The other guys are on fire.  Yeah, the other guys are on fire pretty good.  There's no doubt.  I mean, it's just like with lightning.  Guys have had their shit where their feet get blown off, but they live, or their shoes  get blown off.  It's weird.  Electricity is a very strange thing.  My shoes got blown off once.  No, they didn't chip off.  Yeah, they did.  I got shocked by lightning.  Yeah, what happened?  I'm sure they did chip off.  Chip off.  All right.  Thank you.  It's electric.  Yep.  This one's for Roland, before you leave us, Roland. 
[01:52:00]  Bruce.  Go ahead, sir.  Daniel?  Yellow.  Daniel?  You're on the air.  Daniel?  Call her?  Yeah.  You.  Go.  Bruce racing sucks dick.  Oh, shit.  Roland?  Coming?  Oh, that guy's on a...  ...fashed into some wires.  Yeah.  Well, that didn't go as well as I thought it would.  They're showing a hot air balloon hitting some fucking electrical wires right there.  Right.  Bam.  Bam.  Wow. 
[01:52:30]  That's fucking scary.  That Mozilla guy getting ousted or having been forced to step down.  Crazy.  Because he donated money to a group that was fighting gay marriage in 2008.  And Bill Maher pointed out, or one of Bill Maher's guests pointed out, hey, back then Obama was against gay marriage.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he gave like a few bucks.  Thousand dollars.  Thousand bucks.  And then OKCupid, who Mozilla, I guess OKCupid was their biggest hit. 
[01:53:00]  Mm-hmm.  These motherfuckers wouldn't allow any Mozilla traffic to come to their site.  So to get to OKC...  Like, this guy does something in his own private...  And again, I think he's a cocksucker because I don't agree with what he said.  I think that's a shit cause.  Right.  But how can we operate like that?  That's unbelievable.  It's...  And how many years ago did he do that?  2008.  Intimidation.  2008, so six years ago.  The company should have stood by him.  Well, of course they don't. 
[01:53:30]  They have to.  Fuckers.  You now have to have a perfect life.  Perfect.  Perfect, perfect.  And your opinions, keep to yourself, even if you're asked for them.  Oh, God, yeah.  Why would you give an opinion at this point?  It's intimidation.  Yeah, Bill Maher said there's definitely a gay mafia.  He goes, if you fuck up, they'll whack you.  Which is kind of funny.  Well...  Whack.  I mean...  Gay people are probably tired of fucking having to deal with this shit. 
[01:54:00]  I don't know.  But okay, Cupid banning traffic, like...  That sucks.  You can't do that.  No.  That's not the free market.  Someone from the...  I think Gladys said that's a free market.  That's not the free market.  If none of your customers are using it, that's the free market.  But a company just going, no more access, we don't like your opinion.  Yeah.  That's not free market.  And did he give $1,000 to a group that specifically...  Oh, I don't know.  ...was against gay marriage? 
[01:54:30]  Or was it a group that one of their things was that they were against gay marriage?  It's just another political contribution.  I don't know.  Because that's even worse.  It was a ballot initiative that would ban same-sex marriage in California.  Oh, okay.  So I think the guy's a jerk-off for his stance.  I think his stance is shit.  He's a big, fat fuck.  But you have to be able to be a big, fat fucking idiot.  And if it's put to a vote and you're promoting one side of the vote,  it's not like it's this underground fucking KKK shit. 
[01:55:00]  It's democracy in action.  They're voting.  He's got an opinion.  And a right to vote whichever way he wants  and to support whatever candidate or bill that he wants passed  or any proposition without these consequences like this.  That's insane to do that.  It's mob tactics, classic intimidation.  But no one's speaking up.  Nah, why would they?  No one's speaking up.  If gay people say, look, fuck this guy, 
[01:55:30]  we think that he's actively lobbying against us.  He's not just saying, I don't like gay people.  Right.  He's trying to have our lives inconvenienced.  He's trying to not give us the same rights as straight people.  So I get why gay people would hate this guy's guts.  Yeah.  Then don't use Mozilla.  That's, to me, the free market.  Right.  Yeah.  Blocking access from OKCupid is dangerous, man.  You just don't use it if you don't.  You know what the worst part is?  This is the fucking company, letting him go as CEO.  Like, fuck that.  He might have resigned.  It might have been his decision.  I don't know.  Even so, you shouldn't have to.  If the gays want to protest or do whatever they want, that's fine. 
[01:56:00]  But companies and people and entities, whatever, have to stand firm and not give in to these  things because that's when it becomes effective intimidation.  Who are you talking to?  I think there's some people on the other side of this.  No.  Apparently there's a membrane that vibrates and sends electricity to the mic.  I'm not even being a dick.  I'm saying it in a way that no one's going to listen to you.  No, no.  They got to start listening.  Yeah. 
[01:56:30]  This company would do the same fucking thing.  Of course.  Out.  Out.  The fact that he's lobbying against gay marriage and giving money, it's like, what are you  so worried about?  Right.  Yeah.  Why can't you?  That, that, I do hate this guy.  Yeah.  But again, he's got to be able to say that.  He's got his fucking stance.  And again, like I said, it's a legitimate, legal election.  It's a bill that's trying to, or proposition.  It's not some underground thing.  Right.  This is democracy in action. 
[01:57:00]  And there, there are plenty of countries where you're, you're, uh, uh, killed for voting  a certain way.  Right.  Uh, to have that kind of intimidation on a vote is very dangerous.  Because what if it's not just a proposition?  What if it's a candidate?  And, you know, you get that type of intimidation.  I think we saw that when the Black Panthers were in front of some of the polling places,  um, during Obama's first, uh, term election.  But I mean, it's, it's classic intimidation.  Let's go to Jay in South Florida. 
[01:57:30]  Jay.  Jay.  Hey, uh, so the OKCupid CEO, I had just read this last night, actually.  They found out that he donated $500 to Chris Cannon a few years ago, who has like the worst  record for supporting gay rights in Congress.  There you go.  The, uh, this OKCupid thing is a big, I'm in the online dating business, actually.  And this OKCupid thing is just a PR stunt.  Oh, okay.  It's all a big PR stunt.  It's just, um, frightening that people who are speaking out and not going with gay marriage, 
[01:58:00]  like, I'm caught in the middle because I hate them.  Like, I really do hate their opinion.  Mm-hmm.  I agree, but it's, it's complete fucking bullshit to ruin this guy's career and his business  over this.  That's it.  It's completely illegal what he's doing.  I would rather this guy get caught blowing someone in a rest area and have his life ruined  like that or fall down an elevator shaft because he's a twat.  Yeah.  But just when someone is voicing their opinion, it is frightening when there's penalties. 
[01:58:30]  By the way, all the people that when we do, like, you know, say, like, you can't, you  shouldn't fire people for saying stuff.  Uh-huh.  Well, doesn't the company have a right to represent themselves?  This is where it leads.  So all you people that were saying, like, hey, yeah, man, this company does have a right  to get away with this guy because he did racial jokes or whatever, or he made a racist statement.  This is where it goes.  Yeah.  This is the next step.  Now this guy is just donating to a cause that he believes in.  Yep.  And they're, and they're, and they're fired.  You know, or he's being, pressure is forcing. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah, exactly.  There was just recently a whole to-do about PAC money and who can donate what to a candidate  or a proposition, and it's completely protected under the First Amendment.  It's your First Amendment right to be able to support a candidate or a proposition as you  feel you want.  And to have this happen because of it, it's a direct consequence based on the guy's freedom  that he has, his legitimate right as an American citizen.  Yeah, like- 
[01:59:30]  Hold on, Trout, pardon my interruption, Trout.  Is this, before I forget, is this, someone said they didn't block Firefox, they displayed  a message saying the Mozilla CEO contributed to anti-gay marriage.  A lot of people saying that OkCupid wasn't actually blocking anyone.  Okay.  I'm reading that they called for a boycott.  Oh, okay.  Right.  Then I might have-  Boy.  But people say that, you know-  Boycott.  A boycott.  With a boy on it?  Right.  How old are we?  I know.  So funny, it's a boycott.  Yes. 
[02:00:00]  People say that his views are intolerant, but isn't it like forcing someone to resign?  That seems like a little intolerant to his views.  Yeah, but what I didn't like was, I'm saying GLAAD, but I think it was GLAAD, but it was  some spokesman who said, oh, that's nonsense, that's a subjugation of the word.  No, it's not.  No.  Intolerance does work both ways.  Isn't it funny that GLAAD is always mad?  It's just ironic.  They're constantly mad.  But anyone who's out there lobbying against gay marriage, you really got to look at yourself  in the mirror and go, what the fuck, is it my business, what other Americans are doing? 
[02:00:30]  You really are a shithead if you're out fighting.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm even trying to think of a good devil's advocate point of view on this, and it's very  difficult to come up with one.  I cannot think of one reason.  Yeah, yeah.  Like I said, though, if you're supporting a candidate or a bill where one part of it  includes the protection or sanctity of fucking marriage, whatever they want to call it,  then you have a little more of a defense.  Because it's like, all right, look, I'm not really for that, but I like everything else 
[02:01:00]  in the bill, or I like everything else this candidate's doing.  You got to kind of compromise.  But if you're just putting money to stop gay marriage, yeah, that's a little odd.  Like, who gives a fuck, really?  All right.  We should take a break, because I think Morgan Spurlock is here.  I say them homos should be able to do whatever the fuck they want, just like us regular people,  right?  Am I right?  Well, you probably could have said that better.  All right.  But the sentiment is appreciated, I'm sure, but however you're phrasing it, it might 
[02:01:30]  lack something to be desired.  However, gay people probably will be like, we're happy, you're for us, but could you not  say them homos?  Point taken, point taken.  Where's Morgan Spurlock?  Is he here, Rowan?  Yes, I saw him.  Hey, Morgan, what's up?  I saw him.  That's Kenny.  Oh, there's Morgan.  Come on in there, sir.  How are you, Morgan? 
[02:02:00]  Good, good.  Look at you.  Looking good, brother.  Absolutely.  Brian.  Absolutely.  There you go.  Plop right down over there.  Inside man.  Nice.  Second season, right?  Second season, yeah.  Congratulations.  I'm a second season.  Not an easy thing to do these days.  When you get one, it's amazing.  When you get two, it's like a miracle.  Right.  Knockin' on wood for three.  We'll see.  I tried watching it, and I had a problem with the...  I was so annoyed, because the link kept crapping out.  I'm watching the paparazzi one, where you're hanging out with the paparazzi.  Yeah.  And there's that... 
[02:02:30]  I don't forget the guy's name, but you're kind of lurking, and you get the photo of...  Who's that actress that you got coming out of the fucking yoga place or whatever?  Oh, was it?  And she stopped, looked at you guys, and kept going.  Oh, what's that girl's name?  Yes, I am.  Brittany, uh...  I'm like the worst.  I was the worst paparazzi, because I was like, that person looks like somebody.  Uh, yeah, yeah.  No, it is.  Yeah, so it was the...  She's, um...  Brittany something, no?  No, she was one of the, one of, like, the Hills girls, and Giles knew who she was.  Oh, really?  She was like, oh, that's blah, blah, blah, blah.  And I was like...  Ashley Tisdale.  Ashley Tisdale.  That's exactly who it was.  So you were being a paparazzi for the day, just to see what they go through? 
[02:03:00]  Yeah, well, this whole episode's all about, like, our fascination with celebrity.  Yeah, yeah.  Why have we gotten to the point where these are the people that we put on the covers of magazines,  these are the people we idolize, and so it's all about just, like, obsession with fame.  With celebrity, yeah.  It's crazy.  Oh, yeah, Jimmy.  And it's a multi-billion dollar industry.  Like, it's like three billion dollars a year generated by the magazines, TMZs, the world.  Like, oh, it's nuts, dude.  Were you able to get the gist of what these guys not go through?  Because I barely... 
[02:03:30]  I don't really have much sympathy for them.  I don't know if you do now.  Who, the paparazzi?  Yeah, yeah.  The celebrities, the paparazzi.  Because you start to have very little sympathy for both sides.  From both sides, really?  That's what I was going to ask you, too, about if you do have any sympathy for them.  But were you feeling the wrath of some of these celebrities?  You know, it's like we were...  I was at the...  There's a scene where I'm at the airport as Kim Kardashian's flying in from Paris.  And there's, like, 50 photographers there.  And I'm there trying to, like, get a picture along with, like, 50 other yahoos.  You know, trying to get a shot. 
[02:04:00]  But as the giant security guards that come out with her just come barreling through the crowd,  knocking, like, the crap out of people, getting you out of the way.  And you're there in front of them.  And the guy's just, like, giving you the Heisman, you know, knocking you out of the way.  Wow.  Yeah.  And so you start to have a little sympathy for these guys because they do have a tough job.  And these are...  Some of the guys are people with families and kids who are just trying to make a living.  And then there's, you know, there are guys who are a bit more dodgy.  But I think that's...  But it's, like, it's any business.  But, yeah.  But don't the celebrities work with the paparazzi, too? 
[02:04:30]  You learn.  That's the amazing thing that you learned, I learned over the course of doing this episode,  is Kim Kardashian calls ahead, of course, and tells the paps when she's arriving at places.  Right.  And not only that, but, you know, when you're a photographer, you have an account at an agency.  And so every time you get a picture that's taken, you know, it goes into the agency,  and then you get money from it.  Right.  They have their own account.  The Kardashians have their own account at a photo agency.  So now they call the photographers.  Photographers come take the pictures.  They take the pictures.  They get a kick out of every picture that gets printed.  Wait, who does the Kardashians? 
[02:05:00]  The Kardashians have their own account.  Because they love the notoriety.  I mean, there are some celebrities that don't want any body intruding on their lives, but  they love it.  But those are the ones you don't hear about.  That's right.  Because I've heard over the years that these guys all call the paparazzi and say,  hey, I'm going to blah, blah.  I'll be there.  I'll be there at this time.  At 2 o'clock.  And all of a sudden, it's like this snapshot.  You're like, how the fuck did they get that picture?  Yeah, yeah.  But it was set up ahead of time.  And that's what you realize.  And that's what...  And then the celebrity acts like, oh, God, no, please, no.  No, stop. 
[02:05:30]  Get out of my face.  Yeah.  But their business is being in the tabloids.  Right.  She doesn't have a job.  Right.  You know, Kim Kardashian doesn't have a job.  That fuels her celebrity.  There's nothing else she can do.  So why would she not enjoy that?  That's right.  And call up the paparazzi.  That's right.  And what about the rest of the paparazzi guys?  Did you get along with them?  Yeah.  I mean, it's like there were guys that were making fun of me for being there because I'm  a terrible photographer. 
[02:06:00]  I am, like, absolutely the worst photographer ever.  And, but, you know, they brought me in.  They kind of showed me the ropes of what they do.  And there's guys who do different things.  Like, there's the guys who wait at the airports.  Like, there's TMZS guys who do nothing but stand there and just wait for flights from New  York to come in.  Right.  Do they know who's going to be on them or no?  They do.  That's the other weird thing is you start to realize that there's people who work at the  airlines that call them and give them tips.  Oh, no kidding.  Yeah.  For a little taste.  They get their taste.  So they're like, they're like at the airport.  It's like a casino with the guy that used to call Pesci's character.  That's right.  The hotel guy, the parking lot guy. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's not going to be in his room today.  It's the same thing.  Same thing.  Exactly the same thing.  So there's people at every air, like these guys have tipsters at every airline that call ahead  and say, so-and-so's on this flight flying to L.A.  So when they land, they're waiting at the airport.  It's crazy.  Wow.  Yeah.  Do those people get in trouble, though?  The airline people?  If they found out, I'm sure they probably would.  Yeah, they'd probably keep it on the QT.  They keep that.  How much money is involved in some of this stuff?  Well, it's crazy.  Some of the money is nuts.  The guy that I spent the most time with was this guy named Giles. 
[02:07:00]  Amazing guy.  His whole thing is, he just fishes all day long.  So he drives around L.A. in his car.  And what he does, he just waits to catch somebody.  Here's somebody going in the store and getting a latte.  And then he takes a picture of them.  Because he does all, like, the stars are just like us photos.  Where you see somebody walking out of a Piggly Wiggly with toilet paper.  Yeah, look at that.  That's his kid.  You, Brenner, has to shit.  He's just like us.  He shits just like us.  It's amazing. 
[02:07:30]  It's amazing.  When you go to L.A., all you have to do is go to a Starbucks.  And you're guaranteed to see at least one or two celebrities.  Somebody will wander in.  In the morning, yeah.  Are there places that they just know, like, this is where they hang out?  Yeah.  One street in L.A.  They don't go to.  Well, there's the one where the Ivy is.  Or where the Ivy is.  They go there.  And then there's, like, in Brinkwood.  Robertson in L.A. is a huge one.  Yeah.  And the celebrities know that.  Where the paparazzi camp out, if they have nothing else, if they're not doing an airport run or whatever, 
[02:08:00]  they'll camp out on Robertson knowing that celebrities are coming through.  That's exactly right.  And it's the ones that really are looking for the attention, too.  Yeah.  And then they act like, oh, God, stop.  What are you doing?  I'm just trying to go to the Ivy for lunch.  But everyone knows you go there specifically to get your picture taken.  As you have a table out on the patio.  Exactly.  Where everyone can see you.  And everyone sees you.  Well, Kim Kardashian calls them.  Why does she rush through and look down?  That's just part of the act.  It's part of the act.  Yeah, it's the spin.  It's all bullshit is what I'm trying to say.  I don't get it, though.  Don't.  Don't.  For every celebrity standing up going, you know, the paparazzi are really intrusive. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  Most of them know that it's all one big fucking game.  That's right.  This shit wouldn't happen without the demand for it.  So what do you think that is?  What is this fascination?  I mean, a lot of it is, you know, when times are tough, you know, people are looking for  any outlet to feel better, feel good about themselves.  And any time you can look at somebody, oh, look, their life looks so much better than mine.  And, you know, look at how happy they are on that red carpet.  And look at their beautiful house and their kids.  I don't think people would like that, though. 
[02:09:00]  Isn't it depressing to be like, oh, God, my life sucks?  But I think some people look at it as just like a little bit of escape.  Living vicariously through.  Yeah.  In the middle of, like, your really terrible day, you buy this, you know, $1.95 magazine  and you can look at it and be like, oh, look at how beautiful she is.  Bikini bods where they circle the problem area.  That's always good.  The problem area.  You've got to guess who it is.  Worst bikini of the year.  Right.  Who doesn't do that?  I would guess that's a big picture to get.  Any starlet at the beach in a bikini.  With, like, a big jelly ass.  Right, right.  With something wrong. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  Somebody has a big cottage cheese behind.  That's a lord ass.  You will clean up.  You will clean up with those photos.  But that's all.  So back to the cost.  So Giles, who drives around and takes those pictures, he'll take, you know, with the photos  he takes, he'll make anywhere between $50 to $100 per picture average, usually during  the day.  That's all?  Well, but he takes, but he'll take anywhere from 10 to 15 photos that he can sell a day.  A day.  So he'll make, he says, so I average about, you know, so you figure if I make $1,000 a  day, so he's making $350, $360 a year. 
[02:10:00]  Right.  On average.  Yeah.  And every day he gets up.  He gets up.  He drives his circuit, takes pictures, plugs them up, and that's all he does.  And just knows where the celebrity's going to be.  Yeah.  Like we were taking pictures.  Doing their regular stuff.  And he drives around.  He scouts through.  We were at, like, we saw the Gold's Gym, and he goes, let's just see who's working out  in Gold's Gym.  And so we go up, and he looks through the fence, and there's Ray Liotta in the back.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  He's like, he's like, hold on, I'm going to get a picture of Ray Liotta.  And I was like, is Ray Liotta all sweaty?  Like, really worth some money?  He's like, oh, yeah, I'll sell this.  This would be worth $300, $400. 
[02:10:30]  And I'm like, wow, who knew?  Wow.  It's amazing.  So it really is like fishing.  It is, completely.  You don't know what you're going to get.  Oh, I got one on the line.  Yeah, yeah.  What was the best one he got while you were with him?  The best one he got, Ashley Tisdale's probably a good one, because she was coming out of  yoga, like wearing her yoga clothes, her little tight pants, the yoga nits.  Who was that?  I'm sorry.  Ashley Tisdale.  Oh, that girl.  So that girl coming out, that was probably a good one.  Who else did we see?  We chased Jamie Lee Curtis.  She gave him the finger for taking a picture.  She doesn't like the paps. 
[02:11:00]  No, no, especially these days.  And then, oh, I'll tell you the one that was fantastic.  So we were driving down the road, and we saw these people waiting outside of a house.  And we're like, what is going on?  What are all these paps doing out here?  And they're like, oh, yeah, Reese Witherspoon's inside.  So there's guys who chase certain celebrities around town just because they're valuable.  Right.  And Reese Witherspoon is one of those.  Jennifer Garner's one.  So if people know where they are, they'll stalk them.  They'll wait outside for them to come out, take pictures of them, chase them to where  their next destination is.  And this is where it gets dangerous, because these guys literally will chase them to where 
[02:11:30]  they're going.  Yeah, yeah.  When does it get to the point where they have enough pictures of the one celebrity?  Instead of chasing them to every location they're going to.  Yeah, I mean, some of them will take a picture and stop.  That's good.  And some pop brothers will be like, hey, can I just get a photograph?  They'll take theirs, and then they'll leave.  Right.  But then there's other guys that just chase them all day long because they know this  person will get me money constantly.  Right.  Yeah.  Jeez.  I understand why the celebrities hate them, though.  Because, like, yeah, you're a celebrity, but there's a point where you're just taking  your kid to school.  Yeah.  And they complain about their kids being used in photos. 
[02:12:00]  That's right.  Like, what magazine uses them?  Like, People or whatever?  Or Us Weekly?  Yeah.  If the celebrities just boycotted and said, any kid photo used without the person's  consent, none of us will appear in that magazine.  Us would stop doing it.  That's exactly right.  And that's one of the things we talk about in the show is that if there's a guy who runs  a security firm in L.A., it's called a huge bodyguard company, a guy, Chris, runs the  place, and he basically says, he goes, listen, celebrities would just get some balls and say,  we're not going to do this anymore.  We're not going to cooperate.  He goes, things would change. 
[02:12:30]  He goes, but some of them need it so much that it's not going to go away.  Right.  That's what it is.  It's become part of, you know, hey, we need that.  It's become part of the machine.  And there's no guarantee that they're going to be celebrities forever, either.  That's right.  If they knew that, then they could easily all get together and go, all right, fuck, let's  stop this.  I'll do it until 2015.  Right, right.  A lot of these people are just hanging on for dear life.  Yeah.  They're hot for a few years and then they're done.  And they know that.  That's why they would never agree to something like that.  Of course.  Wow.  Is that the picture you took?  Which one is it?  Let me see it.  Oh, I didn't take that.  No, no, no, no. 
[02:13:00]  That's pretty much for that.  That's her in her yoga, though.  No, that's her in her yoga outfit.  But, yeah, the one that Giles took was her coming out of, she's like next to her Mercedes.  It looks more like this one, but that's not it.  Right.  Okay.  Closer to that one.  Damn.  But look, that's a million of her just in yoga.  That's right.  And so that's what people do all the time.  Were you doing any sneaky telephoto shit or did they always know you were there?  Yeah, climbing in the trees and stuff.  No, no.  Like I was hiding in the van.  We found this guy, Jaiman Honsu, you know, the guy from Amistad.  We saw him working out over on the Santa Monica steps. 
[02:13:30]  We're like, oh, let's hang out here and we're going to picture him.  So I got photographs of him working out, which, you know.  Did he feel kind of creepy?  You feel so creepy.  No, you feel so.  Yeah.  Well, because the big story we tried to chase, because this is like in the middle of like Lamar Odom's  kind of crack meltdown.  Right.  You know, they were like, you know, so that was if anybody can get a picture of Lamar  Odom right now, that's that was the that was the unicorn.  Like if you can get the unicorn of him, then you've made it.  So we started going to all the places where he was.  And I'm like outside of like the alleged crack house in L.A. where he was, the hotel.  And you're just camping out. 
[02:14:00]  And you're like, wow, I feel like a scumbag.  Right.  I feel like the dirtiest person right now, because you're known yourself.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's true.  Exactly.  They're like scumbag.  And it's you.  Yeah.  I knew you were a scumbag.  That's what they're saying.  Was there anything you didn't take a photo of?  Like you mean, I didn't take a photo of a celebrity that I could actually sell.  Did you make the seven hundred fifty dollars?  I didn't.  I didn't.  We got the.  So we put my photos up online.  And then I was like, hey, we got some checks coming in. 
[02:14:30]  I'm going to send you the I'm going to send you the receipts.  Right.  And so they came.  I made like four dollars.  Oh, that's not quite enough to live on.  What percentage did he take?  I made.  He said, I'm not taking anything.  It's four.  I made three, like three dollars and eighty cents.  It was.  I didn't even make four dollars.  It was less.  Three dollars and eighty cents.  You should just do.  Take pictures of other people's pictures in magazines and just sell them and help them  know where you saw it.  Exactly.  Nice.  Yeah.  Well, because there's so many photographers there.  So you're like, oh, that was my picture. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll draw a hat on him or something a little different.  Photoshop a fucking night.  Wow.  That's right.  I got to tell you, inside man.  It's a good show.  Oh, thanks.  Congratulations.  Yeah.  Thank you.  What other topics you're hitting up this year?  Yeah.  The so that's the first week.  Second week is is, you know, we ask the question, like, can you live forever?  You know, now it's like people are getting older than ever and technology is helping us  live longer.  And so, you know, so the question was like, what would it take to actually live forever?  And I go to see this doctor who puts me through this, this crazy barrage of tests and  tells me what's wrong with me and what I need to do. 
[02:15:30]  And at that point, we just start using that as the jumping off point.  Because today it's like you can they're printing they're printing organs now.  So, like, you know, if I keep drinking the way that I do at some point, I may need a new  liver.  And now I've stored my stem cells at a place in North Dakota where they can harvest your  stem cells and then put them in a vault.  Right.  And then if you need them, they have them.  Oh, wow.  And so and so now they can, like, print you new organs.  And we interviewed a doctor in North Carolina who he's printing kidneys, he's printing livers,  he's printing hearts.  What do you mean by printing?  So it's like a 3D printer. 
[02:16:00]  Right.  Like they're like you know that technology.  So how are they using it in the medical field?  And so what they're doing now is they're taking they're taking like frames of your organs.  Right.  Basically, the veins of the so they had they have the vein framework.  And then upon that vein framework, they're taking your stem cells.  And they've done it now with animals.  They've yet to do it with a human being.  But they've done it with multiple animals where they build, just like they would anything  else, your cells on this framework of veins to create an organ.  Why is it so much harder to do it on humans?  I don't think it's always like a lot of this stuff. 
[02:16:30]  I don't think it's harder.  I think it's just liability.  I'm sure.  Yeah.  I'm sure years ago they tried things on humans all the time.  And I have some people like I got a lawyer.  I wish you my lawyer.  I always feel like they have done it on humans, all this stuff, but they just can't come forward  with it.  Probably.  There's probably a lab somewhere.  We absolutely cloned a human.  Get the fuck out of here.  Absolutely.  I want one of those.  Wait, how do you think it's going to be closed?  I would be so much more productive.  How do they get them?  What, clones?  Stem cells.  Stem cells.  They harvest them right out of your backside. 
[02:17:00]  Oh.  So they basically dig down into your cells under like a certain layer, like underneath a couple  layers of skin, and they pull them out.  So you could do that, and then why can't they just do that when you need them, or does  it take a while for them to multiply?  No, they can take them whenever you want.  So they can take them now, and you want them taken as young as possible, because as young  and as healthy as you can be.  Because from now, so now I've got the healthiest stem cells of a 43-year-old man.  Right.  There you go.  And as you get older, then your cells will continue to age.  So now, if I'm 60 and I need them, I have the cells of a 43-year-old, which is better. 
[02:17:30]  I wish I would have done that 30 years ago.  Yeah, right?  Exactly.  Well, I wish they would have known about it 30 years ago, really.  That's a good point.  You're raising a good point.  Leaving your ice cube tray at home?  Why not?  I put other fluids in and have a giz cube.  The aging doctors, what are they saying about life expectancy today?  Well, this is the amazing thing.  So we interviewed this guy.  There's this guy named Ray Kurzweil, who...  Oh, God, is he a bore.  We love him, but he's a genius.  Of course he is.  But he's a genius. 
[02:18:00]  He's like a ridiculous genius.  We had him on him.  We liked him.  But he's got this whole idea called the singularity.  Of course.  Which is when technology and biology will come together.  It will come together, and they're predicting that to be 2045.  So the idea is you live as healthy as you can to 2045, and then every year beyond 2045, that you can live biologically, technology will add another year.  So basically, you'll gain two for every one you can live, which is crazy to think about.  So the idea is just living as healthy as you can to that year, and then by that point, you'll be able to just, you know, gain extra. 
[02:18:30]  He says that, but I think his time frame is wishful thinking, because he says that's how long it will take to map DNA.  And once they map DNA, and they learn how to load your memory and stuff up to a hard drive, there's a whole bunch of stuff.  I just, believe me, I think it will happen.  I just think that his time frame is off.  I hope he's right.  Well, we met a guy, we already met a company in San Francisco called Cambrian Genomics, who they're already hacking DNA.  So like if you, and not hacking DNA to where it'll cost billions of dollars, but where it'll cost thousands of dollars.  Where they went into my DNA, and so I'm basically prone to type 2 diabetes. 
[02:19:00]  And they said, here is the one piece of your chromosome strand that is off.  He goes, we could fix that tomorrow.  Let's just take that out.  We could literally take that out and put in the correct piece and it'd be fixed.  And I was like, that's, no, I'm not going to do it.  Why?  Because it would cost a lot of money.  How much?  Thousands, thousands.  Well, thousands isn't bad to avoid diabetes.  It's not bad.  Yeah, but it's like, or you can just eat better.  DNA start replicating in that new DNA without the.  And then once you fix that strand.  Without the strand in it.  So, so.  The show's on CNN.  Get your, get, get this fixed.  I know. 
[02:19:30]  Come on.  Jeff Zucker.  You're making good money?  Jeff Zucker, take care of this for me.  How many thousands, though?  How many thousands?  They didn't say.  They said that it would be, they said it wouldn't be, they said it would be, it would be expensive.  Like right now, it's still cost prohibitive for most people.  Then you wonder like, all right, what else would that affect?  Yeah, exactly.  Suddenly I'm like, quaddo.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Quaddo.  It's growing out of my stomach.  Right.  Well, you don't have diabetes, but every time you sneeze, your asshole falls out.  Yeah, that's some tricky stuff. 
[02:20:00]  Very tricky.  I mean, Mickey Rooney lived forever.  He was 93 and looked like shit for most of the time.  Well, that's the question.  It's like, do you want to live to be, it's like, sure, you can live to be 150.  I was like, yeah, but what am I going to look like?  How am I going to be at 150?  That's the problem.  And how active are you going to even be?  That's right.  So I'm going to be like George Burns for 75 more years.  Yeah.  It's like, or am I going to be like this?  Yeah, because that's the, I mean, the goal of the fountain of youth thing is to be able  to live forever, but be in a young, active body. 
[02:20:30]  And look good.  Not just age like normally, but you stay alive.  That's right.  That would just be horrible.  Or I'm just like, I'm like the mom in Brazil who just keeps getting stretched faster  and faster.  My skin just keeps getting pulled further and further across my face.  That would be 75 extra years with not one girl interested in you.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I live 45 that way.  But think how hot the robots will be then.  Then you can just have a sex robot.  That's true, too.  A little sex bot.  That's right.  That'd be nice.  Yeah, we got to think about what they're going to incorporate. 
[02:21:00]  What other episodes?  UFOs?  Yeah, we do an episode about UFOs.  We're doing one about UFOs, which is great.  We're doing one about student athletes.  You know, like, should you pay student athletes?  Of course you should.  They make billions of dollars.  Billions of dollars.  I went and played football at Ole Miss as part of that episode where I just got my ass  beat by guys twice my size and like half my age.  And it was, it's a great episode.  But I'm still, like, I still have no feeling in this thumb from, like, getting hit by this  guy.  You took real hits. 
[02:21:30]  Oh, yeah.  Isn't that a weird kind of a situation, though, when you start paying students?  Well, it depends on what you pay.  Here's the thing is what I say is if you're going to pay them is, so they say they're going  to pay for their education.  It's like, well, what if they want to go to medical school?  What if they want to go to law school?  What if they want to get a master's, a PhD?  Are you going to pay for that?  Or are you only going to pay them while they're making millions for university?  You know, if they get hurt while they're in college, you know, one and a half percent  of these guys actually get to go to the NFL.  Is that it?  Wow.  One and a half of every player in college. 
[02:22:00]  So these guys are making these universities so much money, knowing they don't even have  a chance to make the money after they leave college.  And so now here are these guys who, one of the guys that we were with had two ACL surgeries  already, had two knee surgeries.  Well, you know, the chances of that guy, I mean, he's a great player.  Will he get to go to the NFL?  Maybe.  Chances are more likely not.  So as he has health problems later on in life, who's going to pay for that?  What's going to happen?  Is he have to have another surgery in four or five years?  Will the university take care of that?  Well, these guys are broke.  Now, no, they're done.  No, so the thing is, I feel like there's a way to, quote unquote, pay them or incentivize 
[02:22:30]  them that isn't just giving them a check.  And they're not getting a real education.  A lot of these student athletes are, it's fake school.  Yeah, like North Carolina, the story that broke about those guys.  Oh, Jesus.  Where they weren't even going to class.  Yeah, yeah.  There was no class.  They were basically, they had to, quote unquote, write a paper.  Write a paper.  I read one of those papers.  Holy jeez.  It was written in crayon.  It was really bad.  Yeah.  They're not going to the classroom whatsoever.  Yeah.  But then where do you draw the line?  Do you pay the cheerleaders?  Do you pay the, you know, the support crew?  The lacrosse team. 
[02:23:00]  The lacrosse team is bringing in all the money.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think it'd be easy to figure out how to divvy it up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Percentage of the revenue generated by that sport.  Division I basketball is huge, obviously.  Division I badminton, not so much.  Not so much.  Baseball, no one cares about college.  But now, do you give all the players the same thing?  Or the star players make more?  Like, all of a sudden, now you're going to have agents coming in to negotiate deals for  these?  Maybe it's just a flat fee.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, because one of the guys we were with, he couldn't even, he was at the point where 
[02:23:30]  he couldn't pay his phone bill.  Right.  And so, it's like, if you can't get a loan, and you can't pay those types of bills, then  what do you do?  And it's like, there's no time to get in there.  And people are saying, well, they should go get a job.  Like, their full-time job is being football players.  And you heard about the guys that are actually starving?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  You heard about that.  They can't even get food.  They can't even really get food because, you know, they're being watched so closely.  So, you know, they can't even give them food, or that's considered tampering with the players.  That's right.  A benefit.  And a lot of these guys can't even fly home.  So, you're watching these amazing, you know, college athletes, and then they don't even 
[02:24:00]  go home for the holidays because that would be breaking the rules, too.  And they come from ridiculously, you know, poor places.  So, they stay at school.  They have no choice.  Yeah.  It's terrible.  But that's a great show.  That'll be a great episode.  The UFO one.  I saw part of that, too.  You went to meet these people.  What does this guy do?  Is he a technological advisor for something?  That tech advisor you went to see?  Well, there's a guy.  We went to see a guy.  There's an organization called MUFON, which basically, they are UFO investigators. 
[02:24:30]  And it's like, I had no idea.  There are like thousands of MUFON investigators.  MUFON.  MUFON.  The MUFON.  Mutual UFO Network.  That's right.  Mutual UFO Network.  Nice.  And so, MUFON basically has all these people.  You have to go through a real training regime to do it, you know, to become a MUFON investigator.  And then you go, and when somebody sees something, they actually investigate everything.  You need a better name, though.  MUFON is not a good name.  It doesn't sound good.  It doesn't ring out.  Yeah.  It sounds like move on.  It's like move on.  Which, you know. 
[02:25:00]  Or a terrible sex term.  I want to get my MUFON.  Boo.  That's a weird thing that's happened in recent years, too, is the fact that cameras now just are everywhere.  Yeah.  Yet, legit, you know, what would we consider legitimate proof of UFOs, you know, the heyday  was in the 60s and 50s.  Sketch artists.  Do we have any videos out there right now that they're really just baffled by still? 
[02:25:30]  I don't know.  I mean, there's not any that are.  There's a guy that we met with whose his whole job is to basically debunk everything.  Right.  Who is like, he's a MUFON investigator who rips apart photographs, rips apart video evidence.  And his whole thing is like, listen, I believe.  Because I believe in all this.  He goes, but I have yet to see something that makes me, that compels me enough to be like,  this is great evidence.  This is great proof.  Weren't there a couple of photos that they could, like, most of them they figured out  what was wrong, what they were natural occurrences, but there were a few that they  just couldn't debunk.  By now they might be able to with computers.  Why would they just be hovering around? 
[02:26:00]  If they have the technology to get to Earth, wouldn't they just wander around knowing that  we can't fuck with them?  Well, there was a couple people we interviewed in that show where you expect to, like, meet  kooks.  Like, you expect to meet, like, some, like, you expect to be, like, an episode of Cops.  Like, here's a guy drunk with his shirt off going, I saw it over the corner of the field.  Like, that's who you expect.  But there were people that we interviewed for that show who had real sightings that they  couldn't explain.  Right.  A woman, there was a husband and wife who was a, he's a musician, she's a nurse,  and completely credible. 
[02:26:30]  Like, these were normal, everyday people, like, living outside of Atlanta, who they  were, like, and they've had, like, three different sightings outside of their house, and he's  like, I can't explain it, I don't know what it is.  He basically plays his guitar on the balcony, and he thinks that that lures them to, say,  he's a whack job.  But his wife's completely normal.  Right.  But his wife is a normal nurse, and she says, he yelled at me, came in and grabbed me, and  she goes, I couldn't explain what it was.  And what were they saying?  Well, they had two different sightings.  One of them, they described this thing that looked almost like a glowing pink trash can 
[02:27:00]  turned upside down that was over their house that then started moving off into the distance  over the trees.  That was the first one.  And then the second one was this giant, it was huge, almost like boomerang-shaped that  was reflective, so basically it was reflecting the sky and everything else that was in it,  but you could actually physically see it moving through the sky above their house.  That was the second one.  And there was a video?  Video?  No video.  No video.  Well, because here's the thing, so he started taking photographs with his camera, and as 
[02:27:30]  soon as he pulled his camera out, basically all the electronics in their entire house  went out.  Of course.  And the camera was fried.  Of course it did.  Yeah.  That's right.  Oh, man.  I believe, though.  I just, you know.  It's hard.  I believe, I believe there's life all over the universe.  That's right.  And I believe.  We've got cameras, though.  I mean, there is one thing that isn't photographed now.  Right.  I mean, the second something happens on the streets, everybody's got a camera over their  head and taking video and pictures.  You would think one credible, amazing. 
[02:28:00]  One shot, yeah.  UFO flying saucer.  It's all part.  It's all part of the cover-up, man.  Cover-up.  It's all part of the cover-up, man.  It's all part of the government.  You could believe what you want to believe.  I've seen the conspiracy.  Right.  Any of the UFO experts explain why they just hover around and are checking us out?  No.  It's like, no.  Because the real experts, like the people who run SETI, like the Search for Extraterrestrial  Intelligence, like these people, the people who run that place are, you know, these are 
[02:28:30]  real scientists who are out every day.  And they're listening.  They're, like, searching the universe with, like, crazy, you know, telescopes.  And they're like, listen, we have yet to find anything.  They're the laughingstocks of the scientific community, by the way.  Laughingstocks.  But they really are.  They're the fucking, you know, they're like the hack scientists, even though they're really  great scientists.  Oh, what are you looking for?  Yeah, that's cute.  Spaceman, you dicks.  But how much of our galaxy can we listen to at this point?  Well, that's the whole thing.  They say that as they, like, searching through the galaxy, they're like, imagine if you've, 
[02:29:00]  imagine if you've, like, dipped a cup of water into the ocean.  Like, that's what we've listened to.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah, they're saying that we have so much more to even, like, start to explore.  Yeah, our galaxy is just one of whatever.  That's right.  It's nothing.  Millions or billions.  They don't even know at this point how many galaxies.  Oh, hundreds of billions.  Hundreds of billions.  Hundreds of billions.  So.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So we're only listening to a tiny, tiny, minuscule portion.  At some point, it's going to be like when you're driving in a car and you finally find  that station, you're like, oh, there's that station.  Right.  Like, suddenly they're going to be like, oh, we should have been listening over here the whole time. 
[02:29:30]  Oh, fuck.  We missed.  How do you get yourself into these jobs and situations?  You approach these people.  Do they say, no, we don't.  Have you been turned down?  They're like, oh, there's that jackass.  Yeah.  It's like using the, look at the school as an example.  When we were calling around saying we want to make an episode about student athletes,  we called so many schools.  Schools that had a lot of violations.  Schools that have happened.  And they're like, absolutely not.  We want nothing to do with this.  I mean, a lot of schools were very adamant.  Ohio State, you know, a ton of them were like, no way we're letting you film here and do this. 
[02:30:00]  What about Penn State?  There you go.  Going to the showers.  Happy Valley.  Happy Valley.  I think they're a little gun shy of having people in there.  Poking around.  You know what happened there with that guy?  Oh, no.  What happened, Jim?  One of the assistant coaches had a whole, yeah, he was a big snitch.  I guess they were hiding this story, huh?  The media didn't want to work.  Yeah, that's so weird.  Yeah, this McQueary guy.  What a terrible guy.  Tattletale.  Tattletale.  Let Morgan work the showers for her.  Come on in, boys.  They don't call me inside man for nothing. 
[02:30:30]  Someone's got a thought on the lights, the lights.  This guy has seen the lights, too.  Jack in Jacksonville.  Go ahead.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Morgan.  Great.  I love your stuff, man.  Oh, thanks, man.  Listen, about that one object you referred to, that boomerang-shaped one, that's a real  common thing.  That was the subject of the Phoenix Lights, and that's something I've seen.  Myself, it's clearly a man-made thing, though, you know what I mean?  But I wonder, what do you think about that?  Why is it that nobody seems to be able to figure out what it is, but we see it all the 
[02:31:00]  time?  I mean, that's a great question.  That's one of the things we ask about is, you know, some people say, well, it's got to  be some sort of, maybe it's a government ship, maybe it's something that we're testing and  it just hasn't come out.  And it's like, maybe.  I mean, who knows?  I mean, I feel like...  It's like a floating object.  It sort of, it seemed like it was helium-filled and had lights on the side of it.  And then when I saw that documentary, Phoenix Lights, everybody was making a big deal about  it.  I'm like, I saw this fucking thing in South Carolina in the 90s.  What was it, Phoenix Lights?  Yeah, so did they say what it was? 
[02:31:30]  Did they come up with an idea in the show?  No, no.  Do you remember a couple years ago that we were seen over Phoenix and millions of people  called in the Air Force?  And that's all it was.  It just floats there.  It's helium-filled or...  Or alien-filled.  Ah, you never know.  You never know.  Hydrogen.  And it's got blinking lights.  And it seemed, when I saw it, it came over to treetops.  And then it realized, oh, shit.  It's like, uh-oh, we're in the open.  And then the lights started blinking on, off, on, off, and then off completely. 
[02:32:00]  But you still see it in the air floating.  Did it make any sound?  It's huge.  Were you probed slightly?  Yeah, a little probage.  No sound, though?  It didn't make a sound?  No, it was like a very small hum, almost like there was an outboard motor and a fan.  You know, it's very man-made.  It's man-made.  It's like special ops or somebody.  I mean, that's what I can't understand.  And it was in the 90s, so I didn't have a...  Oh, yeah, not everyone didn't have their cameras.  Nobody had a camera back then. 
[02:32:30]  I think in the 50s and 60s, when there were so many sightings and stuff,  I think that was a lot of Russian and American technology that we were kind of trying to hash out.  Yeah.  I think before computers, there was a lot of trial and error going on.  It was like you couldn't virtually fly something in a computer or in a smaller scale,  so that you actually built this goddamn thing, sent it up, and whatever happened, happened.  And that's some of the old UFOs.  Yeah, the prototypes.  People are like, aliens!  There's an alien!  How weird, you just had a paparazzi shot. 
[02:33:00]  I see that.  Talk's coming in right now.  Now our own...  One of your episodes.  Slobarazzi.  Oh, no.  Sorry.  Oh, E-Rodge.  We only have five minutes left, and there's a few more calls I want in.  Thank you, Jack.  Let me go to Kevin in Philly.  Kevin, go ahead.  Kevin?  Morgan Spurlock in studio, Inside Man on CNN.  It's Sundays, right?  Sundays at 10.  Yeah, it premieres this Sunday, 13.  Great.  Go ahead, Kevin.  Hey, boys.  I'm going to get ribbed for this, but Morgan, I saw your One Direction movie. 
[02:33:30]  Oh, yeah, you did.  I've seen it like five times, and it's fantastic.  Oh, thank you very much.  What One Direction movie?  I directed a film last year about One Direction called One Direction, This Is Us.  You actually directed that?  I did that.  Okay.  Yeah.  You directed that?  I did.  How did we not know that?  I know.  We've known you forever.  I know.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah, no, I got called...  This is a funny story, because I got called years ago when we were doing...  We were finishing a film...  I just started doing Greatest Movie Ever Sold.  Right.  And while we were doing that, I got called by Paramount, and they said, we'd love you to 
[02:34:00]  come in and meet with us about this Justin Bieber film.  And I was like, I'm in the middle of this other movie.  There's no way I can chase that massive film right now.  And then when we were finishing both the Comic-Con and Manson films, because we were finishing  those simultaneously, Paramount called again and said, we've got this Katy Perry movie.  And at that point...  Oh, shit.  And I was like, God, you've got to be kidding me.  I said, this is the second time.  And that one, you were inheriting somebody's headache.  It had all already been shot.  Oh, okay.  And they're like, put this movie together.  Wow.  Take this footage and make it.  And I was like...  Is that the one that came out last year?  That's the one that came out.  I saw it. 
[02:34:30]  It was a disaster.  Yeah, I mean, it's...  I don't know why, but...  I feel like the 3D didn't pop off the screen.  I feel like a lot of it felt very kind of candy-coated.  And then when I got called for this, they said, have you ever heard of this band One Direction?  I was like, of course I have.  And so I was like, this is the third time.  When you make docs, to get the chance to make a film of that scope and that size, I mean,  it never happens.  It rarely happens.  And this was the third time I got called.  And so I threw my hat in the ring.  I had to go do this.  And I got the job.  And it was amazing.  Yeah.  So we got to make this crazy 3D $10 million movie. 
[02:35:00]  How are they?  They're actually good kids.  You know, these are kids who realize that they have been incredibly fortunate and really  lucky.  And now here they are.  They're about to go on a big stadium tour this year.  I mean, so last year, when we were filming them, it was all arenas.  This year, they're doing all stadiums.  They're going to be like Giant Stadium, Gillette.  Wow.  You know, Chicago.  I mean, it's going to be massive.  Screaming girls.  Rose Bowl.  They're doing three nights at the Rose Bowl.  How big is the Rose Bowl?  100 plus thousand.  You're doing 300,000 people?  In three days, yeah.  It's crazy. 
[02:35:30]  Wow.  Yeah, it's nuts.  So yeah, so that, but I'm glad you liked it.  No, I enjoyed making that film, and I think the film came out fantastic.  I'm really proud of it.  How do you know where to put the camera, Morgan?  I just, it baffles me.  It's a wrecked thing.  Was it screaming girls everywhere you guys went?  Everywhere we went.  We were filming in Mexico City, and the whole time we were in Mexico City at the hotel, 5,000  girls camped outside the hotel every day for five days, just yelling, screaming, singing.  I mean, it was bananas. 
[02:36:00]  Wow, man.  And that's like those guys' life every day.  Are those guys married?  None of them.  One of them's about to get married.  He got engaged last year.  Oh, what a dummy.  Yeah.  What a dummy.  There's plenty of time to get married.  Yeah.  What is he, 20-something?  20, like 2021.  What is he doing?  Yeah.  Yeah, just got Zane.  Zane got married.  Wow.  They got engaged.  Yeah, so there's the trailer.  I do enjoy a good documentary.  Like, I wish there were more quality ones.  Yeah, what have you seen recently that you liked?  Oh, gosh. 
[02:36:30]  I've been into these goddamn air disaster documentaries.  It seems like that's all that's on TV right now.  I know, I know.  But I saw the one about the PSA flight that went down in San Diego back in the late 80s.  And they came back for the 30th anniversary and had interviews with the people.  And that was pretty compelling.  But it could have been better.  Yeah.  And I wanted it to kind of be better, you know?  Yeah.  I like the sushi documentary.  Oh, Juro Dreams of Sushi.  Juro Dreams of Sushi is a great film. 
[02:37:00]  It's a documentary about anything.  Did you do that?  I didn't make that one.  I didn't like that one.  Boy, which one was it?  But it's a beautiful film.  Juro Dreams of Sushi.  It's a beautiful film, though.  Yeah.  It's really beautiful.  And I loved...  But why wouldn't he open up a bigger place?  Because he could make a gajillion dollars in that tiny little place.  How, though?  There's only 10 seats or something.  But I think he charges a dumb amount of money for a seat to sit there.  I think it's something crazy.  The Guccione one was good, too.  I like the Bob Guccione doc.  And the Hugh Hefner one.  Yeah.  What about Act of Killing?  Did you guys see that?  I didn't see that one yet. 
[02:37:30]  That's weird.  That's bizarre.  Well, it's amazing.  So there were all of these people who...  There were these guys in Indonesia that killed communists during the communist uprising.  In the 60s.  And none of these people were ever prosecuted.  Because they were basically doing the government's work.  And so there were these guys that were hired killers.  And they killed like a million people, you know, that were communists.  And so the film is about this guy who goes back and finds these guys who killed people  who were murderers for the government.  And he starts interviewing them about killing all these people.  And not only just interviewing them in a normal way.  He basically says, we want to tell your story.  We want you to write this story of what you did. 
[02:38:00]  And so these guys write a script.  And then they act out killing these people.  And so they add...  So basically, they're acting as themselves and acting as the people they're murdering  as they're filming it.  So they're turning it into almost like this play.  So it becomes like this film in a film.  And it's brilliant and crazy.  So bizarre.  So batshit crazy.  But the film is...  It's really well done.  What's the best documentary you've ever seen?  The best documentary I've ever seen...  Well, there's two trains of thought.  Like, there's docs that I give to people.  Like, the best doc... 
[02:38:30]  My favorite doc of all time is a movie called Brothers Keeper.  That were done by...  Did by Joe Berlinger and Bruce Zanofsky.  The guys who did Metallica, Some Kind of Monster, and Paradise Lost.  Which is about these three creepy brothers who live in upstate New York.  And one of them was found dead one day.  And so then they basically accused the other one of murder.  And it turns into this, like, weird, creepy story of, like, incest.  And it gets dark fast.  Wow.  It gets so fast.  It gets dark fast.  I saw part of that years ago on video.  I never saw the end of it for some reason.  Now you maybe want to go back and watch it.  Maybe you came already. 
[02:39:00]  Before the word incest...  Half of incest that one was finished.  Ince.  Flunk.  But then there's docs.  But then people always say, like, what's a good doc?  What should I watch?  And then there's, like, gateway docs that I give to people.  Because people are like, docs are boring.  I don't want to watch them.  And then I give them, like, Anvil Story of Anvil.  Or American Movie.  Heavy Metal Parking Lot.  Hands on a Hard Body.  Heavy Metal Parking Lot.  Parking Lot.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Those are good.  Those are, like, great docs.  The King of Kong.  The King of Kong is one of the best ever. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah, that's a great gateway doc.  A lot of great characters in that one.  That's right.  Steve Weeby.  Steve Weeby.  Super Size Me.  That's a good gateway doc.  That's a good gateway doc right there.  Sure.  Great film, obviously.  Before you go, because I hear you only have, like, a minute left.  Sure.  Robert, well, let him talk.  Robert and Birmingham, it looks like.  Yeah, Birmingham.  Go ahead, Robert.  Yeah, I want to call BS on the student-athletes that were starving, unless it's a real lower-tier school, maybe, that you were talking about. 
[02:40:00]  I know at Alabama, they have 24-hour access to healthy snacks, fresh fruit, all that down in their student center.  They get the best tutoring, tutoring that nobody on campus could afford.  So the question is, if you're going to get paid, if you decide that they're employees, don't they owe taxes on the about $200,000 value of the room and board and education that they get over the four years?  That's a great question.  But you know a lot of those guys aren't going to school for the education. 
[02:40:30]  They're going there because it's, you know, it's the next step to get into the pros.  Yeah, and especially if you're, like, you're in the SEC.  I mean, you're going to Alabama.  I mean, you're going there to play Tier 1 football.  The SEC is, like, the best football in the United States.  And the tutors are just to get you a passing grade, but I wonder if you're actually soaking in any of that knowledge in the end.  We had a Rhodes Scholar four years ago.  I'm sure you have some of those people, but it's not the majority.  But that's, like, one every four years.  That's what happens at most schools.  It's available. 
[02:41:00]  You can't – I mean, most of those guys couldn't write their names when they showed up in college.  There's a limited amount of what you can do with them.  Yeah, I mean, that's –  Well, that's our point.  Why are they in college then?  Exactly.  They're in college because they're hoping to get into the pros.  Yeah, and there are a lot of guys who are coming in.  And it's a good life for four or five years as they're doing it.  It's a trade school, and you don't get paid while you're in trade school.  And I guess the starving thing maybe is a slight exaggeration, but I guess what I was trying to say is –  I don't know where that happens.  Yeah, and it's just harder to get food and stuff. 
[02:41:30]  You know, you'll do what you can to get your food.  And the trade school people aren't – the trade schools aren't making $50 million on TV deals.  There's a lot more money being made than this.  Morning's got to go.  Big time.  We're over the time.  Thank you, Robert.  And thank you to you guys.  I was actually talking about this in the hallway.  It has been now 14 years that I have – that you guys have been there and supporting me.  We were there before anyone knew who you were.  Before anyone.  Before anybody.  That MTV show.  I was literally talking about this in the hallway, so I just want to say thank you. 
[02:42:00]  She's got the name of the show.  I bet you will.  I bet you will.  I bet you will.  We're at A&W and a young Morgan Spurlock walks in.  Young, fresh-faced kid in the business.  And then he left and we're like, ah, he'll never make it.  I don't know.  Exactly.  14 years later, he's still doing it.  That's amazing.  Morgan Spurlock, Inside Man, this Sunday, it premieres season 2, 10 p.m. on CNN.  Yeah, right on.  And it's Morgan Spurlock on Twitter.  Very cool.  Thanks, Morgan.  Thank you, guys.  Appreciate it.  As always.  We'll see you next time. 
[02:42:30]  Morgan Spurlock.  Morgan Spurlock's all right, man.  Yeah, he's a good egg.  That's for sure.  That was fun.  Biggest story of the day.  Ooh.  Let me think.  Biggest story of the day.  My Tampa shows this weekend.  Ah, that's a big story.  Nice.  Right.  No?  Uh, I would say The Immortal. 
[02:43:00]  Does it start with The Immortal?  No.  Obviously not.  Yes, it doesn't.  I hope not.  Mickey Rooney?  No.  Mickey Rooney being dead is a big one.  Not as big as this story.  John Panette died?  No.  Oh.  That sucks, though.  He's a nice guy, man.  You comedians love dying early.  Well, like I said before, comedians either live to be 90 or they're dead before they're  50.  It's a very weird, you know, because I think comics live one of two lifestyles. 
[02:43:30]  Either you live a very healthy lifestyle and you get all the aggression out.  Oh, right.  And it's like beating cancer all the time because you're just constantly venting about what you  don't like.  So, you know, guys like Henny Youngman and Bob Hope and fucking George Burns or, you know,  the unhealthy lifestyle gets you going, unfortunately.  Well, he was kind of chubby.  Yeah, but he lost the weight.  He went, I think, for surgery and then someone said it was...  Missed picture.  He had some other things going on. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah, but that picture is deceiving because I'm thinner than that.  I'm wearing a hoodie, though, today.  Giving me an extra pound or two.  What?  I'm putting all this mush back together.  What is that, Instagram or Twitter?  That's our Twitter.  O&A Show on Twitter.  Sorry, Jimmy.  Go ahead.  That's all right.  I apologize.  That picture just popped up in the middle of that. 
[02:44:30]  Go ahead.  It's a shame that he's dead.  I didn't know him well.  He's a nice guy.  He's a sweet guy, man.  I ran into him a few times over the years.  Real nice guy.  I never met him.  I don't think we ever had him on the show for whatever reason.  I did Montreal with him.  And we had spoken earlier, like, you know, what a...  Just a great guy.  Not a great crowd.  I was on the show.  Anthony Clark was on the show.  I don't remember who else was.  But I remember none of us were doing great.  We were all doing okay.  And then Panette went on and fucking murdered.  And he was just so funny.  I'm watching him. 
[02:45:00]  And he's doing this bit on gluten.  And I'm like, God, who the fuck closes with a bit on gluten?  Gluten!  And he was really a funny guy.  He was a great comic.  Did a lot of self-deprecating fat guy jokes, right?  Yeah.  I don't know exactly what killed him.  I guess they're finding out, was it...  Found him in a hotel in Pittsburgh.  Pittsburgh, yeah.  You'd never want to read that about yourself.  That's right.  I thought you went to Pittsburgh to make your life seem longer.  To make it seem like you're living a long, long time.  John Panette actually did... 
[02:45:30]  That's the best thing that can happen in Pittsburgh.  You don't have to deal with it anymore.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  But I love you, Pittsburgh.  Pittsburgh, his heart, or his...  He had some issues, huh?  Yeah, man.  He had some health issues.  We've heard him over the years.  Yeah.  He lost a lot.  I think he got the surgery.  He did get the surgery.  Oh, he did.  He got the lap thing.  Oh, a long time ago.  But I think he might have went back to his old ways or something.  Yeah.  And he had a reputation for, you know, drinking and...  Yeah.  You know.  And they said it was kind of hard for him to get through shows sometimes.  He said he had heart.  Oh, wow. 
[02:46:00]  Pulmonary embolism.  Pulmonary embolism.  But they don't know that yet.  That's too soon for them to know.  That's what his manager or agent said.  He was the guy who got mugged at the end of last Seinfeld, I guess?  Yeah, the last Seinfeld.  He was the guy that got mugged.  And they just videoed him.  They didn't help.  That's a good copy of the clip, right?  I'd see him better.  First class doesn't make it anymore.  Well, we can't really see.  Yeah.  The audio's really bad.  And they...  There he is.  Of course, the mugger. 
[02:46:30]  That's a shame.  Who's the mugger?  I don't know.  Just making an observation.  Oh, of course.  All right, boy.  That's hardest.  That's a shame.  Yeah.  He was only 50.  Yeah.  I am.  50 years old.  I'm 50 years old.  Was Mickey Rooney married to Judy Garland? 
[02:47:00]  I don't know why they...  I looked him up and they said,  I see Judy Garland.  He's married eight times.  I think he was married to Ava Godner.  Ava Godner was his first.  For a year.  You want to see how fucking...  Oh, my God.  I Twittered my photo of Mickey Rooney scolding me for being a dirty comedian.  Yes.  That was only a year ago, right?  No, no.  It was probably two, three years ago.  Already?  Yeah.  But I got a picture with him and his wife, and I didn't want one with his fucking wife.  I wanted one with him.  Your fucking wife.  But she jumps in, and I wanted to say, like, what are you doing, lady? 
[02:47:30]  Right.  But I couldn't yell at a guy's wife.  Wow, is he fucking giving you the old what have you?  Was he joking about...  I don't know, but look at me and his fucking monstrous wife.  Oh, boo.  He's hiding like a child between us.  There's no way to Photoshop.  Why are you in this picture?  You can't shop that out.  She's famous for marrying Mickey Rooney.  Now, she did movies with him and stuff, but, like, I can't fucking Photoshop her out.  Her big, fat fucking head.  What is she doing in this picture?  What a fucking...  Oh, get out.  I think he grabbed him. 
[02:48:00]  Oh, my God.  Look at this giant he was married to.  Wow.  Probably like to get smothered a little bit.  Yeah.  Big, big butt in his face.  Smothering him.  Oh, Jesus.  93.  I have good teeth.  You have big old Bill.  And then he kicked me in the guts.  Yeah, Bill.  Why are they talking about the movie Bill?  They should.  Instead of all those other films he was in.  Those crappy fucking Judy Garland movies.  I got you this job at the country club to keep you out of trouble, remember? 
[02:48:30]  I won't be in any trouble, Miss King.  Everything's all right.  And I won't get picked by the cops more.  Everything's onky-dory.  And the television.  I bought that so you can stay out of trouble, too.  Television.  Oh, boy.  That's...  I dream of Jeannie.  That's a cutie.  Oh, is that fucking embarrassing to watch?  You think that's embarrassing?  Yeah, really embarrassing.  I'll be all right now.  Old Bill will be fine.  Merry Christmas.  Ho, ho, ho. 
[02:49:00]  He went full retard.  Bill.  What?  That's my name.  William.  Bill for short.  Oh, hi, Bill.  I'm Barry.  Hi, Barry.  No, Barry.  Barry for short.  Yeah.  No, you dummy.  Exactly.  Well, where's Tara?  My sister.  She lives on Florida Street.  And it's like, no, she went to Florida, you dummy.  What happened to your face?  I was downtown, and this guy come up to me. 
[02:49:30]  He said, buddy, you didn't know my name.  And I said, yes, you want to go have a beer with me?  I said, sure, buddy, I'll have a beer with you.  And then he said, how would you like for me to knock your teeth out?  I said, mine ain't very good anyway.  Fucking home run, Bill.  Cocksucker.  Now, all you have to do is just sit there and tell me about yourself, and I'm just going  to sit right over here and ask you some questions, and that's all there is to it. 
[02:50:00]  Okay?  That's all there is.  You ready?  All right.  Let's start with an easy one, okay?  How old are you, Bill?  33, 46, 58, I'm a real spring chicken.  Ugh.  Are you?  You don't like that?  Oh, it's terrible.  I got in an argument with my girlfriend at the time when this movie came out.  It was a TV movie, and we watched it, and she was crying. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah, 81.  She was crying, and I was laughing, and she started punching me.  Because I was laughing at Bill.  He was 60 when he made that movie.  Hmm?  I think it's 1981.  Yeah, huh?  33 years, I guess, right?  So, 60.  Oh, my God.  Oh, he was 60 when he made that?  Jesus.  You know what this is?  It's a microphone.  A cock.  It's a microphone, right.  It's a mic for short.  Mic for short.  Oh, no.  Oh, no. 
[02:51:00]  Where have you been, Billy Boy?  Billy Boy.  Where have you been?  Darling, Billy.  Oh, yeah.  I've been down to the farm.  Didn't do no harm.  Can you make a cherry pie, Darling, Billy?  You don't like this song?  No.  Not at all.  Oh, and then he plays the harmonica.  Oh, wow.  Wow, Bill. 
[02:51:30]  Oh, ho, ho.  It's a good song.  Yeah, where have you been, Billy Boy?  At the tarred house.  Where do you think he's been?  Exactly.  Did you notice how your paint chips were missing?  And here's a full tummy?  I didn't do no harm, and I didn't do no harm.  And you make a cherry pie.  Yes, I didn't do no harm.  I accidentally smothered nine animals.  I sat on a bunch of baby chicks.  My fat dumbass.  Where have you been, Billy Boy? 
[02:52:00]  Billy Boy?  Yeah.  They killed one guy.  He was having a fit.  They knocked him down the stairs.  They killed him.  I went to the guy in charge, and I said, hey, this kid is having a fit.  And he said to me, Bill, don't you bother me while I'm resting. 
[02:52:30]  And he kicked me in the gut.  He kicked him in the gut.  Director?  Shut up.  Was he pitching a fit?  Yeah.  He didn't like the insane asylum.  See, Bill was a normal kid.  He was just like, he had some kind of small problem.  Right.  And then his parents, because it was that time, just threw him in an insane asylum.  And he grew up with all retarded people around him.  So he became kind of retarded. 
[02:53:00]  And then Dennis Quaid makes a documentary about him.  Why'd they sing a song?  I don't know.  Remember when we talked to Dennis Quaid only about this movie?  Only about that.  We had Dennis Quaid on.  He was pitching one of his movies.  I don't know.  I don't know what it was when he was in.  He was cool, right?  He was great.  And I just kept going, oh, boy, chicken.  He just laughed his ass off.  He was like, holy shit, he was shaking his head like you motherfucker.  And then it got to the point where he basically was saying, enough, okay, I get it.  Oh, Bill.  But we wouldn't let it go. 
[02:53:30]  Barry.  And then, of course, the famous scene, the chicken scene.  Yes, the chicken scene.  We've got to play this one more clip.  One more clip.  I guess Bill thought it would be, or Barry thought it would be a good idea to bring Bill to his parents' house.  Oh, where was his parents' house?  It was in some hoity-toity fucking Connecticut.  There you go.  It was in Connecticut.  Yeah.  And they're wealthy and have no time for a retard like Bill.  And they were making chicken.  And Bill just makes an ass of himself.  Oh, his Dennis Quaid's family?  Yeah.  Oh, and he eats all the chicken. 
[02:54:00]  Oh, he gets his hands all over every piece.  His dumb hands.  His own parents were just dicks to Bill.  Bill's got his hand down the back of his, scratching his asshole and his dick and balls.  And then he just holds your chicken.  Darling Billy has a roid the size of a yam.  He's been fucking digging that.  His yam-sized roid.  He's grabbing a chicken.  Right before he grabs a handful of chicken.  He's fucking itching his scalp and fucking knuckle-deep in his asshole. 
[02:54:30]  He didn't know you'd just take one fucking piece.  He's like, you know, he's an idiot.  Yeah, he learned the hard way.  But here's a quick part of that scene.  Are you good and hungry?  I hope you are.  I'm good and hungry.  I like it.  Are you a company?  I'm the president of one.  Kitty.  Green bean.  They're good for you.  I like green bean.  Oh.  Have a lot.  We've got plenty.  I like plenty.  Plenty.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And some sweet potatoes.  Thirty.  He means one. 
[02:55:00]  Oh, look at that chicken.  Isn't that good.  He just keeps grabbing the chicken.  Isn't that good chicken.  Go easy on that.  It's good chicken.  Bill.  Bill is on a diet.  He's watching his weight because of his leg.  Isn't that right, Bill?  I'm not watching my weight now.  Bill, put that back.  I'm going to have more chicken.  Put that back.  I want to have more chicken.  Put that back.  He keeps grabbing it.  Yeah.  Stand his hand. 
[02:55:30]  Uh-oh.  He yelled at him.  Oh, no.  Where'd Bill go?  Bill ran to the corner in the kitchen.  Ew.  He went to the corner.  Did he?  To stand there as his parents go, what the fuck is this?  You bring this over my house?  He's fucking wrecking all the chicken.  He's fucking standing in the corner.  They weren't too tolerant with Bill and his chicken.  His dumb chicken.  They weren't more tolerant.  They should have told him to fucking push something outside the warehouse.  He must have been a metal.  Oh, but his bad toupee, remember?  Yeah, he got his bad toupee on. 
[02:56:00]  Oh, my God.  That's great, that hair dude.  His toupee.  Yes.  Well, Bill.  Do you know about that media position yet?  No, I only have...  Who's the sister?  Yeah, she's the wife.  Give her a good stiff look.  She was cute.  She was in a few movies.  Yeah.  Computer work.  I had some friends, at least I'm used to.  Dumb hairdo.  Bill's social hair.  Yeah.  The father's trying to get his kid into a good...  It's a good business.  We don't want to change his mind.  We want to do a movie show called The Bill Show. 
[02:56:30]  Why don't you shut up, retard?  Exactly.  We don't like your fucking dumb Moe Howard hairdo.  Fuck off.  Yeah, that's how we met.  We're buddies now, and I got some new teeth.  Oh, that's good.  That's good.  Shut up.  The father's like a...  Look how tiny the table is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are you going to have natural childbirth or that new French method everyone's talking  about?  Oh, how about the Greek method where they pull it out your ass?  Oh, you mean the Le Boyer method?  She's beautiful.  Le Boyer.  Yes.  I wonder what happened to her.  They're good for you.  Oh, look. 
[02:57:00]  Here comes Greedy Bill.  Yeah.  That shitty wig.  There it is.  I like green beans.  I like green beans.  Greedy fucking...  Oh.  Look at the...  They get horrified.  He means one.  See?  He means two or three.  What, does he have an ulcer on his leg?  I think he's got an ulcer on his leg.  Have you two known each other very long?  Oh, about four months.  Isn't that right, Bill?  We've been buddies for a long time.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Here comes the chicken thief.  That chicken isn't that good.  And he uses the fork, but then he takes his hand. 
[02:57:30]  Oh.  Bill, that's three pieces.  Hey!  He's touching it.  Why don't they just move the chicken?  Right?  Stop hovering the chicken by him.  The dumb fucking maid moves the goddamn chicken platter.  Exactly.  Don't you have fucking filthy hands off the chicken?  That's felt horribly.  It really is.  No one would hold the tray in front of them.  Oh, no.  That guy. 
[02:58:00]  Why is she still holding it there?  She's a bitch.  Bill's a terrible runner.  Waddling idiot.  He runs into a corner.  Oh.  With his dumb wig.  Do people really feel sad when this happened?  Yes.  I rejoiced.  I swear, my girlfriend at the time was crying.  And I was doing that shaking because I'm laughing so hard.  He just got too excited.  He's like a little child.  Oh, shut up.  They're in fingers, heinie.  They're going to have a baby.  Billy Bill fucking suffocates it. 
[02:58:30]  I didn't do no harm.  I just suffocated your baby, darling Billy.  Where have you been, darling Billy?  They say that when they see bloody footprints walking away from the crib.  That goes on and on.  So there you go.  Mickey Roney is no longer with us.  Everyone else is focusing on the wrong movies today.  Exactly.  Bill.  That's Mickey Roney's legacy.  Oh, yeah.  Who's that girl?  Where'd she end up going? 
[02:59:00]  Dennis Quaid.  Largo Woodruff.  Largo.  That's her name?  She was a beautiful girl.  She was really hot in the day.  Yeah.  What does her Wikipedia say, though?  Where'd she go?  She didn't do anything.  She does not look good now, I bet.  This is her?  This is her page?  Yeah.  Nothing else?  Nothing, huh?  Where's this bitch?  Man.  Where's this bitch?  Yeah, where's this bitch?  You got a wiki?  She don't even have a wiki.  Wow, that's fucking tragic. 
[02:59:30]  Oh, no.  What other movies did she do after Bill?  The Fun House?  The Fun House.  Bill Part 2.  Yes, there is a Bill Part 2.  Who's in it?  I think they were all still in it again.  Really?  No, Helen Hunt was in it.  Bill on his own, it was called.  Was it Helen Hunt?  Helen Hunt was in on the second one.  She's great in Twister.  What do you think happens?  And what happened with Part 2?  Did he get divorced from this lady and Helen Hunt signed on?  Well, at the end of...  Largo's in this one, too.  At the end of Bill, I know at the end of Bill, Perry, or Barry, whatever his name is, 
[03:00:00]  tells him he's got to move.  He's like, we're going to be moving, Bill.  And Bill is like, oh, I got to, you know, he's got to make it up by himself.  So he gets a job making coffee at the college.  Right.  And then Bill on his own, as he opens Wild Bill's Coffee Shop at the college.  Ew.  A business owner?  And now he's dealing with the students, and the students are all like, oh, hi, Bill.  And they're all nice to him.  That would never happen.  Kicking him in the ass and putting him on the dope stickers on his back.  Is that her? 
[03:00:30]  I'm a dope sticker.  Jesus.  You know kids.  I love how you end it with, you know kids.  Is that her?  She don't look good anymore.  Yeah, she looks all right.  Well, she looks all right, but she's all right.  That's her now?  Yeah.  She looks pretty good for 30 years later.  30, yeah.  30 years later.  She was like, really, yeah.  Wow.  Was she married?  I want to give her a smooch.  The fun house. 
[03:01:00]  God.  God is watching.  I'm a dope sticker on his back.  Ah, fuck.  All right.  Darling Billy.  Darling Billy.  So, ah, yes.  Godspeed.  Five foot two.  My God.  He was a short little fucker, wasn't he?  Eight fucking wives, man.  He started show business in 1921.  20?  He was born in 1920, so I guess he was a toddler.  He was 17 months old, yeah.  Little toddler.  Yeah. 
[03:01:30]  Wow.  That's a long time.  I think his breakout film was in 19, like, 35.  Oh, my God.  Did all those fucking crazy little vaudeville movies.  What a fucking life, man.  What?  And then he testified in front of Congress about elder abuse.  Yeah.  Because he was being abused.  I guess it was his stepson and his wife, allegedly.  Did they kick him in the guts?  He was throwing a fit.  What year did he testify?  It was 2011.  It says he was financially abused by unnamed family members. 
[03:02:00]  I think it was before 2011, though.  He was financially abused.  No, I think there was elder abuse, like he was being hit or something.  Right.  I don't know.  Where have you been, darling Billy?  Just smack him.  Exactly.  How do you not know where he's been?  There's a fucking trail of gunk behind him for Prince Candy.  I thought it was his stepson.  Ah, the stepson's fucking with him.  Yeah.  Oh, here it is.  A headline every week for families across America, 
[03:02:30]  making decisions how to care for aging parents.  So often adult children get caught in the emotions and exhausted.  Just give me a little sucker-roo.  That's fucking ice them right in the eye.  For 50 years, J.R. Gardner was a pillar of strength to his six children.  Good for him.  Dad would call every child every weekend, every Saturday.  Stop saying every.  Pillar of burden.  Jim, in 2009, at age 82, he suffered a debilitating stroke.  Oh, boy. 
[03:03:00]  That pillar now needed his children's strength.  Oh, boy.  Our lives turned upside down July 5th.  Mm-hmm.  Suddenly, another blow.  Their 82-year-old mom, Virginia, was diagnosed with breast cancer.  Jesus Christ.  And then I have to go to the radiologist this afternoon.  Oh, nice conversations to have.  There was a title, Wade, the brothers and sisters never saw coming.  We were going 90 miles an hour.  Amy and Anne are in California taking care of Dad.  J.P. and I are checking out facilities in Atlanta.  Had to stir the sauce.  We were calling Mississippi, trying to touch base.  Got to get over to take these guns.  Oh, Jimmy.  Lois won't get chemo without her head.  They got their dad settled in an assisted living facility near them in Atlanta. 
[03:03:30]  You can't do it in the room, man.  Yet Amy, Beth, and J.P. were caught in a crushing cycle.  We clashed.  And it was...  What is this story?  I thought they were hitting actor Mickey Roney.  Right.  Where's the Mickey Roney part?  Ranking board protection from stepkids and then this video plays.  Right.  Oh.  It's not even about it.  It's not about Mickey Roney.  At all.  Did they beat him up or something?  What?  They punched his old hat off?  What happened?  I don't know.  They fucking... 
[03:04:00]  They practiced judo on his hat while he's wearing it.  Stay in there, pops.  I'm going to fucking throw a kick at your head.  I don't want to see.  Oh, well.  All right.  Enough about Mickey Roney.  Fuck Mickey Roney.  Love to.  I tried to.  He did all right.  His fucking wife just jumped in and hogged the whole...  Do you open up the fucking picture?  See, look at that fucking photo.  I just...  She really did jump right in.  His wife hogs the whole fucking picture.  Fucking bitch.  It's like the Cloverfield monster just attacking me and Mickey Roney.  Look, yes.  Look at her.  What is she doing? 
[03:04:30]  She wrecked the picture.  She ruined it.  Who wants her?  She's covering up the guy that you wanted the picture with.  Yeah, big fat scarf.  I read on Wikipedia they got separated in May of 2013.  Oh, boy.  Good.  What?  He's 92 at that point.  Exactly.  God, why'd that fucking...  Why did they get separated?  I don't know.  She really...  She probably ruined too many photos because her son is the one that he was accusing of beating  the shit out of them.  You're sudden.  They hadn't lived together since last April. 
[03:05:00]  It's attempting to crack Mickey in the head.  She found out he died through TMZ.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  There you go.  Oh, wow.  That's horrible.  Wow.  Fucking bitch.  Fucking ruined my photo.  Ruined your picture.  A kid's fucking...  What's he...  Give it the old fucking...  The old one-two to Mickey?  What a rotten family.  It really is.  For wrecking my photo.  Right.  That's worse than what he was doing to Mickey.  Absolutely.  Right.  You don't wreck a Jim Norton photo?  Yeah.  I don't even mind her being in it, but just the monstrous nature where she's hogging the 
[03:05:30]  whole picture.  Yeah, she's taking up the whole fucking frame.  I think he might have pulled her in there.  Look at this fucking beast.  Why is this beast in my picture?  That really is annoying.  I'm like...  I'm so annoyed right now.  Thank God for the other shot where he's scolding me because that's a much better photo.  But look at this fucking quad lady.  You can't even Photoshop her out.  It's an impossibility.  No.  She's taking up...  Big fucking clawed lady.  You could put like...  I don't know.  What can I put next to me? 
[03:06:00]  The Empire State Building?  Put like some kind of mountain.  There's already one there.  That's what I mean.  Get her out.  Put a real mountain in there.  It looks like Mickey's, you know, peeking from around the corner.  Maybe a walrus in a scarf.  Her giant head.  It's like fucking Robert Plant.  He was fat in a lady.  She looks like a fat Deborah Norville.  Oh, she's enraging.  Hey, we got a guy pooping on slides.  Yeah, I read that...  Where is this happening?  Where is this happening? 
[03:06:30]  It's Michigan.  Michigan.  Michigan.  Okay.  Got a children's park in Michigan, and he's pooping on the slides in the same park for the  past five or six months.  Why would someone do this?  You want little kids to slide down in your shit.  He's the mystery pooper.  Oh.  Officials have discovered feces on the slides so frequently that police installed a hidden  camera to try to capture an image of the act.  Ah.  Put it on YouTube.  Mm-hmm.  Go viral.  I wish it was me.  They're saying the act is weird and deliberate. 
[03:07:00]  Really?  Of course.  Oh, you got something there?  What's that paragraph?  What?  What do you got, mustache?  This quote says, we most definitely need to get this under control before school recess.  The sand park season starts.  Yes.  We need.  It's like a storyline for Parks and Rec.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah.  We got to get this under control.  That's pretty bad.  What a psycho.  How do they know it's not an animal? 
[03:07:30]  It's too big, I guess.  Yeah, they know what human shit looks like.  Animals don't go up on a slide to take a shit, either.  Exactly.  Squirrel shit.  No one's ever confused squirrel shit with human shit.  Big, giant fucking.  Animals have claws that slide down the slide.  We need to get him or her and get them the help they need.  It's him.  It's not her.  Thank you.  They don't have to add the her part.  That's such a guy thing.  I've seen.  Yeah, this is like sociopathic.  This is guy shit.  But I've seen a lot of videos of late of women taking shits in public.  Yeah.  I've jumped off to those videos. 
[03:08:00]  There's one where this woman, I think she's Asian, she's sitting on a bench or something.  Right.  And she slides over to the side of it.  And lets it go.  And you just see this fucking.  Yeah, there it is.  This one.  No way.  Where's this from?  This is probably a fetish video, by the way.  No, this is real.  Yeah.  But it's probably shot like this.  Oh, you think?  Of course.  Yeah, there's no way she would just do this.  It just squeaks to the edge and then just.  Yeah, this is fucking supposed to be.  Oh, my God. 
[03:08:30]  It's a fucking liquidy evacuee.  The runny shit.  Yeah.  What the hell was she eating?  That's.  What a genius way to shit, though.  Wow.  Yes.  One cheek is on the side of the bench, and she's just shitting off the bench.  Yeah, apparently she had a fucking chocolate pudding coffee shake right before.  It's still.  I've never seen anything.  Does she wipe?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's wiping right there.  No, Jimmy's right.  This is a set up video.  Like napkins or.  Yeah. 
[03:09:00]  Totally set up video.  You think?  Yeah, it's for something to jerk off to.  Yeah.  Why would you jerk off to that?  But why would you shit?  Exactly, because it's liquidy.  Why would you shit like that?  There's got to be a bathroom close.  I don't know.  She would have ruined my photo less than Mickey Rooney's fucking monster wife.  Fucking monster lady.  Wife looks like the dumpy Asian lady who just left.  Yeah, it was a big watery dump, huh?  Monster.  But there's, I've seen a few of these where chicks are taking dumps.  Well, the ones in the alleyway, those I believe.  Yeah. 
[03:09:30]  Because they're just looking for a place to pee on the way home or whatever.  Uh-huh.  Those, but not that one on a bench like that.  There's something hot about some drunk chick in one of those little fucking tube dresses  just pulling up and pissing on the street after a night at the club or something.  Those are always kind of hot.  Fair lady takes a shit.  Oh, God.  Oh, man.  No.  What's she doing?  What is she doing?  Uh, this looks like a real video.  Is she going to shit like... 
[03:10:00]  Someone's holding that camera.  Uh-huh.  Wait, is that...  No, it's not a real video.  No, it looks handheld.  It's shaking.  Is that shit that's already on the ground now?  Did she just shit on the floor?  Like, I don't know what's happening.  Does it bounce off her leg?  Oh, she might have a fucking emergency or something.  She's wiping her...  She's wiping her shit off her leg with a jacket.  Yeah, go back a little bit, Sal.  What happened?  Did she...  She's telling the guy, close the door, get out of here. 
[03:10:30]  This is real.  I don't know what happened.  She had the runs.  Yeah, something happened.  And what?  Somebody wouldn't open the door?  She walked out to, like, the alleyway.  Yeah, she told the guy, get out of here.  She said, get out of here.  I got a problem.  But why wouldn't you spread your legs?  Maybe it just came out.  Let's see when it fucking comes out.  Just nuggets?  Do they bounce?  Yeah, they're already out.  Unless she's going to move her left foot, and there they are.  Oh, she just stepped in it.  Ah, what a pig. 
[03:11:00]  What a slob.  You don't shit like that.  You've got to spread your legs, at least.  Maybe she's trying to hold it in.  Fair lady.  She said fair maiden.  Yes, fair maiden.  Fair maiden takes her shit by a mop.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Let's go to Connor in North Dakota.  Connor.  Oh.  Middle of the Atlantic.  Connor.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Yeah, yeah.  I was going to say there was a news story back, I give up.  It was maybe about a year or two ago. 
[03:11:30]  I think it was back, actually, when I was in Virginia, that there was a girl.  She ran every single morning about this guy in, like, alleyway, and she kept on shooting  behind the dumpster.  And he kept on finding it, you know, day after day after day after day.  And he'd pipe up a camera.  They actually gave it to the police.  The police put it on the news.  You can see the girl's face pretty clearly.  He just didn't want to, he didn't want her to get in trouble or anything.  He just wanted to bear as hell out of her.  I'm sorry, sir.  We're watching a video. 
[03:12:00]  A chick, it looks like she shit in her hand.  Right.  And then throws it into a vestibule.  Throws it up against a door.  Up against a doorway.  Good girl.  What?  Ah!  She threw it in the fucking...  Yeah, but why?  She must have had it, but she probably couldn't move.  No, that was her wiping.  We are the worst witnesses.  No, she shot in her hand, dude.  She shot in her hand.  Then why was it white when she threw it? 
[03:12:30]  It's the light.  Watch.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  See?  Those are two nuggets.  That's the light hitting those two...  She threw two shit nuggets.  Let's see how it hits.  Watch.  It's the shit.  That's it, yeah.  That's it, yeah.  All right, fair enough.  Yeah, that was the light.  That's so fucking disgusting.  I hate to see food.  Why would she just go over there and shit instead of shitting into her hand?  I don't know.  Sorry, Connor.  We lost...  Oh, this fucking woman.  We lost interest in your call.  I apologize. 
[03:13:00]  She takes a shit in a supermarket aisle.  Oh, that's great.  Well, that's recycling, technically.  Ah!  And then just pulls up and walks away.  The best is that she's just...  But most people understand that.  Kind of anti-social behavior.  But you've gotten to the point where you can't hold it in anymore.  No, that was...  But you've got to just go in the back or something.  That was on purpose, like, as a crazy thing to do.  Right.  Yeah.  Hmm.  She pulls her...  But she pulls her things...  Like, look at how fast this dump comes out. 
[03:13:30]  Oh, my God.  She barely had time to pull her pants down.  That's why I think she had an emergency.  Carvel soft serve.  Yeah, and then somebody else coming in the door.  And God bless her for looking back at it.  You've got to look.  You've got to look to see what you just did.  Who's the poor motherfucker that went, what?  What?  Is this duty?  Ah!  Ah!  Wow.  I would leave my cart right there and fucking out of that store.  I'm not shopping in the shit aisle store. 
[03:14:00]  Well said.  Yes, thank you.  Does he take a shit?  Is it a girl?  It's a weightlifter.  It's a chick.  Oh.  Is she shit?  Oh, my God.  What happened to her?  That was like a...  It was a viral video from back in the day.  This weightlifter girl.  Diarrhea fail?  Oh, it was diarrhea.  It goes through her...  It goes right through her...  I think she...  She's lifting a lot of weight, so that's almost understandable.  Look at each body of my heart. 
[03:14:30]  Oh, and then she just...  It might be pee.  Grinds it into the carpet.  Oh, my God.  Well, it was part of a montage.  Why would you stop the montage?  Yeah.  Yeah, best is diarrhea.  Come on.  There's so many more.  Diarrhea fail compilation.  This is what YouTube was made for.  Yeah.  The weightlifter one we saw.  Yeah, I want to see some more diarrhea fails.  Put this up on our Facebook page.  Oh, and a show.  Oh, this guy's trying to light his... 
[03:15:00]  He's trying to light a fart.  And he...  Hey, he shits himself.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  He sharted.  She vomits.  This was vomiting live on the air of some show.  Oh, no.  Oh, come on.  That's a joke.  That's not true.  No way.  That can't be true.  No.  Here's one of these cool ones.  I think these are all fake, too.  Yeah, forget we're out. 
[03:15:30]  Just let some stew go in the jacuzzi.  Yeah, we're out.  Someone put E-Rock in my picture.  Oh, no.  Eating a hot dog.  Wait, is that...  Let me see.  Look at E-Rock in the way, eating a hot dog.  That's good.  It covers her up.  All right.  We could get people to cover up Mickey Rooney's wife in your photo for you.  Yeah, please cover up Cloverfield in my picture.  Oh, this one.  I'm sure Jim Norton on Twitter will retweet some of the better ones.  And then, finally, we got the ping happening in the Indian Ocean. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Is this finally it?  I don't know at this point.  They heard some pings on their instruments that would be the same type of pings thrown off by the flight recorders.  Right.  So...  Hold on.  Lady Di wants to get...  She wants on real quick.  What the hell is this?  It's about...  Lady Di.  Yeah, hi.  How you doing?  Good.  Why do you need to talk to us?  What's going on?  I wanted to ask you something.  The thing with Caroline's and everything. 
[03:16:30]  When is this supposed to take place?  You're supposed to have an unmasked show at Caroline's?  I thought this was an emergency.  I knew it was going to be this.  No, it's not really an emergency, but I was just asking about that.  Why?  How do you go about getting tickets for that?  We didn't really promote it today.  I don't know.  How do they?  No, because I heard all about it. 
[03:17:00]  I'm trying.  Oh, my God.  My dear, sweet Jesus, Lord.  Christ.  How are we promoting this mustache?  SiriusXM.com slash unmasked.  You got it?  Yeah, that's where you go, right?  But you have to be a subscriber to SiriusXM, right?  I think that's, is that it?  Yeah, you got it.  You have to be a subscriber.  Oh, boy.  I'm going to have to get somebody else to do that.  Then, you know. 
[03:17:30]  Who do you know that's a subscriber?  Well, Marion is, for one.  Well, there you go.  All right.  Maybe she'll take you.  All right.  All right.  Well, listen, listen, listen.  Yeah.  One more thing.  When is this event supposed to take place?  What day?  Holy fuck.  I don't know.  They're still trying to figure it out.  Oh, they're still trying to figure it out?  It's not going to be like on a Friday or something?  It might be tomorrow, but they're not really sure yet. 
[03:18:00]  Because I heard something about April 17th.  Oh, something about.  No, no, no.  I'm just saying.  But April 17th, they have something else going on at Caroline's.  Uh-huh.  Which has, you know, really nothing to do with XM Sirius.  Exactly.  It has to do with Hot 97.  Yeah.  She actually raises a great point.  Are we there the same rate as Hot 97?  No.  I don't think so, Jimmy.  I'm not asking you. 
[03:18:30]  Jesus.  All right.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  How many natty ices have you had this morning?  It's 10.30.  Around four.  Just four.  That's good.  That's a good start.  Good start.  That's a solid six to seven before noon.  Yeah, you're good.  Not bad.  Normal for me.  Somewhere around there.  Uh-huh.  No, no, no.  Seriously, though.  Seriously.  Big booty girl.  Could you sit around day after day drinking that much beer, Ant? 
[03:19:00]  No.  It just would be, all right, not good.  All right, Lady Di, good luck to you.  Yeah, so it's like a base, a black event, I think, I guess, or, yeah, it's Hot 97.  Is Sam there today, or is he still in New Orleans?  All right, thank you, Lady Di.  Eight o'clock show.  That night.  Because she wants to call you.  Wait, wait, wait, hold on.  Is Sam there today?  Because she wants to glom on to Sam's show.  Right.  Also.  All right, thanks for calling in, Lady Di.  It's the only reason you'd care if Sam was in is so you could call up and get on his show. 
[03:19:30]  Well, I like Sam.  All right, thanks for calling there, Lady Di.  Yeah, it's been great, so.  All right, well, go ahead, hang up.  It's not a hang up if I say thanks for calling.  Yeah.  Okay, you're welcome.  Let me say hi to Al and Buffalo.  Buffalo and Al.  I don't think Bobo or Lady Di or any of them idiots should be at your own mad thing.  It's all about you guys.  They don't need to be there.  That's probably a good point.  Yeah, I don't want any of those guys.  Why don't we need, why don't you want us to be there? 
[03:20:00]  Because it's not.  You guys are just going to mess up the whole thing.  It's all about them.  It's all about you guys.  I was just trying to find out some information on the show.  I think this guy makes a good point.  He makes a very good point.  We don't have a lot of seats in that place there, that Caroline's there.  There's another fan.  How many Nanny Ice is there, Lady Di?  Her seat could be another three fans that get to see the show.  All right, Al, thank you for bringing up a great point.  Lady Di, thank you so much. 
[03:20:30]  You're welcome.  I'm hanging on.  For what?  All right.  So they found a ping, and it might be the plane.  We'll find out more.  I'm sure more info will come up.  I'll tune in to CNN, because they're the last ones on the story.  Everyone else moved on 10 days ago.  Yeah.  Guy's still on the flight simulator.  Is he really?  Yeah.  Yeah, they were doing other flight simulator stuff over the weekend.  Oh, my God.  Ridiculous.  And they're still standing in the middle of the Indian Ocean? 
[03:21:00]  Yeah, they're doing the stand in the middle and watching the virtual reality plane fly around them.  But that plane would be giant.  It's a giant plane.  It's got to be a giant plane.  It would be so easy to find.  Because it doesn't make sense.  Right.  Because Australia is very small in that.  I want to do something.  Situation.  Like where we do it, but instead of like the plane simulator, we don't have it.  So I just put my arms out and act like a plane.  And you're going.  That would be just as good as what they're doing.  It would be more entertaining, actually. 
[03:21:30]  All right.  We're going to go home.  So the ping is happening.  We'll see what the ping is all about.  War.  War.  War.  Who's doing the after show today?  Dennis Falcone.  Denny Rock.  Denny Falcone.  And the E-Rock.  And the E.  It's going to be awesome.  That is awesome.  That is some solid awesomeness.  Personified.  Jimmy's in Tampa this week.  And don't forget.  Yep.  Friday, Saturday.  And then I got Caroline's.  The week after you guys do your thing, I'm at Caroline's.  Yes. 
[03:22:00]  Oh.  And I went into the t-shirt business.  I got a plug today.  Oh, shit.  Right.  Check out the empties, man.  T-shirts are available.  I put them out there as a goof.  And they're actually selling extremely well.  So, they are.  Go to opiradio.com slash shop.  I need a catchphrase.  You do?  Dude, you do.  It just takes a catchphrase.  You already have one, but it's only one word and nobody will wear it on your shirt.  I need a catchphrase.  As goofy as it is.  Oh. 
[03:22:30]  I'm telling you.  I sold.  Yeah.  Damn.  Yeah.  In two days.  So, opiradio.com slash shop.  Yep.  In two days.  It's crazy.  And I'm not making a lot of them because it's too much of a fucking hassle, as you learned  with your compound shit.  Yes.  Very.  Bunch of pain in the ass.  So, get them now because we're not going to keep reordering them.  No fucking way.  All right?  Wait, I have a t-shirt I'm selling.  Yeah.  This can be called, where's those empties? 
[03:23:00]  No.  What?  That's a little similar to the other one.  No.  Here's the check out the empties, man.  And mine is, where's those empties?  Put my arms up in the air.  No.  No.  It's too similar.  And we got fat sizes, too.  So, go get them.  She only have fat sizes.  A lot of fat sizes.  Triple XL and up.  Pretty much sold out.  Yeah.  Very close.  So, all right, guys.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Thank you.  Right.  The Opie and Anthony show is drawn to a close. </pre>
