<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The July 27th, 2009, Opie and Anthony Show began with Opie detailing the hail damage to Kenny's car, showcasing video footage from his YouTube channel and discussing the accompanying air traffic control communications, highlighting pilots' maneuvers to avoid the storm.  This led to a discussion about new car anxiety and the inevitability of car damage, fueled by a caller's comment on Kenny's unfortunate situation.  The conversation then shifted to Leif Olsen's improbable hole-in-one at the Canadian Open, where a lucky bounce off another ball secured him a car.  The hosts speculated on humorous reactions Olsen might have had.  The segment concluded with jokes about "fat B-roll" footage used by news stations and a comparison of Maureen McCormick's weight fluctuations with the drastic weight loss on "The Biggest Loser."

The show's main focus turned to prison life, prompted by Opie's viewing of "Lock Up."  The hosts discussed the inherent dangers, particularly sexual assault, and rigid social hierarchies within prison.  Retired corrections officer Mike joined the show to describe the harsh realities of Rikers Island, highlighting racial tensions, rampant theft, the challenges faced by white inmates, and the difficulties in maintaining order in the dormitory-style facilities. He recounted violent incidents and the use of makeshift weapons. A former inmate called in, describing the immediate forced gang affiliation in a Georgia prison.  Another caller shared his experience after being arrested for possessing a gun near Walter Reed.  This led to a discussion with Jim Norton, who recounted his own unpleasant jail experience. The conversation returned to prison violence and survival strategies.  Later segments included discussion of the documentary "Tyson," further harrowing caller accounts of prison violence, including sexual assault, and a detailed segment on Fleece Johnson, a Kentucky State Penitentiary inmate known for his focus on prison sexuality.

The broadcast included sexually suggestive banter among the hosts, using slang terms like "toss salad," and a discussion of a listener email incorporating this phrase.  News stories covered a fatal wrong-way driving incident, one of the host's upcoming movie roles, and a 77-year-old's gender reassignment surgery, leading to vulgar commentary on the physical aspects of the surgery and aging.  The discussion continued with crude jokes about a transgender mayor criticized for wearing a miniskirt,  speculating on her sex life and physical attributes, and debating the appropriateness of her attire. The hosts also debated the authenticity of *Operation Repo* and critiqued *A Thousand Ways to Die*, focusing on its depiction of often absurd and graphic deaths, including several urban legends.  Jim Norton was present in the studio for at least part of this portion.

Listener calls continued the discussion around *A Thousand Ways to Die* and *Operation Repo*, alongside more offensive jokes about the transgender mayor.  Another segment focused on listener calls detailing bizarre deaths from "A Thousand Ways to Die,"  the show's legal implications, and the hosts' rejected similar show pitch. This transitioned into sports discussions, including Jim Rice's Hall of Fame induction, Michael Vick's potential NFL return,  various athletes' appearances on the show, and Fedor Emelianenko's future in the UFC. The segment concluded with Andy Rooney audio clips interwoven with off-color jokes, referencing Bobby Lee's previous anxious appearances and an incident involving a female guest.

A segment revolved around *Orphan*'s plot twist, featuring the recurring comedic bit "Write It Down, Sam," where Sam frantically wrote down plot points revealed by the hosts and callers like Peter Puffer. This was followed by a recounting of Bobby Lee's panicked exit from the studio after seeing a picture of "Stalker Patty," with Sam Roberts detailing his pursuit of Bobby Lee into an elevator and onto 6th Avenue.  A substantial portion then covered listener calls about recent wrong-way driving accidents, speculating on causes and sharing driving anecdotes, including the legend of "Stone Face," a local police officer.

The show concluded with a focus on falling asleep while driving, featuring personal anecdotes from the hosts and callers recounting near misses, startling awakenings, and even a suicide near a caller's childhood home. One caller described a harrowing experience with a tow truck hauling a lit-up semi.  Several other callers shared stories of near misses and hallucinations from driving fatigue. The segment included discussion of a recent incident involving President Obama, a professor, and a police officer, focusing on the subsequent media coverage and beer summit. The conversation included vulgar language, with a callerâ€™s perspective on Black individuals' reactions to police interactions leading to a discussion about race relations and interactions with law enforcement. The segment ended with mentions of various beers, including Billy Beer.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, Opie and Anthony, on your radio dial, live, Monday, July 27th, 2009.  On your radio dial.  I woke up a little later than usual, Ant.  Did ye?  I get in my ride, which is Kenny's car.  Of course it is.  I'm up maybe for seven minutes, and the entire ride in, I had to hear about hell that hit his car. 
[00:00:30]  And that he only has a $250 deductible for an act of God.  And that he's calling his insurance company, and he has eight dings.  And the hell was as big as softballs at times.  Yeah, big storms, I guess.  Big storms, big storms.  $250 deductible for an act of God.  An act of God.  Are you going to try to put a claim on his brain?  So, I had to act like I really cared about his dumb car and the hail hitting it. 
[00:01:00]  Did it dent it up?  Did you see it?  Well, as soon as he said it was hitting the front of the car, what do you do?  You take a look.  I lift it up off my seat a little, and I'm like, oh, wow.  Couldn't see it.  Nothing.  But I wanted to be nice.  There's dimples on it.  I guess there was hail all over the place yesterday.  Yeah, a lot of thunderstorms rolling through the northeast here.  Well, I'm a storm chaser now.  Yeah, apparently.  I videotape storms now.  Were you extreme?  People are like, yeah, man. 
[00:01:30]  People are like, I think you're losing your mind.  I'm like, what?  Here I am staring out my window for 10 hours photographing lightning.  All right-o.  Let's check that out.  I'll give it a look.  There you go.  Look at that.  Jimmy, look.  Come on.  I'd like to see Sully land during that.  You want to see a lightning strike in our neighborhood?  Bam!  Huh?  Cool.  Huh?  There's another one coming.  Does the news go to that shot?  Do they have a camera set up in your house where they could go, let's go to Opie's house 
[00:02:00]  and check it out.  Wow, there's some lightning.  You know, I was thinking of calling the news and going, you know, I know you're going to  be talking about the thunderstorms and the hail and the lightning.  I got some nice video for your B-roll.  And then I said, you know what?  Fuck the news.  If I had a nice relationship with the local news, I would have called them up and said,  hey, check out the YouTube channel.  There's a nice little lightning shot there.  Yeah.  But I said, nah.  Lightning.  You can check it out for yourself.  Opie Radio on YouTube.  It's like the first video up or something. 
[00:02:30]  But you didn't have any hail out on Long Island, did you?  Not hail, but ridiculous lightning.  And when there's ridiculous weather over at my house, just at my house, it's a big cloud  that just lingers over my house.  In my area, I'm such a geek.  I put on, I have an app on my iPhone where I could listen to air traffic control and Kennedy  approach.  Oh, wow.  And you listen to those guys.  And it gets a little busy.  It gets a little busy.  Do you hear any panic? 
[00:03:00]  No, not panic.  They are fucking cool as cucumbers.  Even in a lightning storm?  But a lot of like...  Thunderstorm, whatever.  A lot of the pilots requesting different altitudes, like my, you know, and kind of want an answer  fast.  Yeah.  Like, I'd like to be at 4,000 right now.  Like right now.  Could you, you know, and it's like, and then sometimes they're like, nah, how about that  request at 4,000?  I'd really like to kind of, I'm heading toward a fucking giant thundercloud. 
[00:03:30]  Can I please just go to 4,000?  I'm basically heading toward God's eye and I don't want to be near that.  But a plane full of death, I really could appreciate 4,000, maybe turn to like 270  or something.  Just their voice a little, a little, a little more excited than usual, right?  Yeah.  And then you hear some of the, I think you just hear like the chick voice come in.  It's like, I would like to bring down to about 4,000.  And I'm like, dead.  They're all dead.  Chick pilot. 
[00:04:00]  Chick pilot.  I haven't had a chick pilot in a while.  Yeah.  Usually that's like the first officer, I think.  Yeah.  I think they're doing the contact there.  Let's say hi to Josh in D.C.  Josh.  Good morning, Bubba Boys.  Hey.  Hey, buddy.  You said Kenny's deductible was $2.50 for, what was that, an act of God up?  Is that what you said?  Yes.  Yeah.  What's deductible for a finger of God?  The finger of God poked his hood.  The finger of God poked my car. 
[00:04:30]  Over and over again.  With hail.  Like if a fork drops on his car, is that considered a finger of God?  See?  Yeah.  Kenny is obsessed with his car.  He just got a brand new car, and I really wish he didn't because now we all have to look  at him as he studies his car every single day.  You've seen that, Jimmy, right?  The studying of the car.  It's his new vehicle.  Yeah.  He'll obsessively look at it.  Very obsessively.  Obsessively.  And then he'll tell the garage guys, what's this? 
[00:05:00]  Because there might be a little smear somewhere.  You don't want to smear, you don't want to scratch, or ding, nothing.  I got a new car recently, and I just hit it with a hammer.  I said, all right, there you go.  Now I don't have to worry about any more dings.  I hear you got to get the first one out of the way, because that first one, oh, does  that make you angry?  Oh, does that make you angry?  It makes you angry, but think about it.  After that day, what are you thinking?  You're not obsessively worrying about someone tapping into your car, right?  You can relax a little bit now when you park. 
[00:05:30]  That new car, right when you get something new, though.  I hate getting new stuff.  It's like, oh, you park way out of the way in the parking lots.  You'll walk like a half a mile in the mall parking lot, because you're parked in the  furthest parking spot away.  And some asshole will always pull right next to you.  Doesn't matter.  There'll be no parking spaces next to you.  You know, empty parking spaces.  And someone will just pull next to you.  Like, you motherfucker.  Yeah, human nature sucks.  That's the same thing with movie theaters.  You go into kind of a movie theater, not too crowded. 
[00:06:00]  You got plenty of open room in front of you.  You sit down nice.  And what happens?  Nine out of ten, what happens?  Tall guy right in front of you or some fat person next to you.  Close enough where you're like, why?  Get away.  The theater's pretty much half empty.  Go sit somewhere else by yourself.  Get away.  What do you need?  My warmth?  You're not going to get it.  Yeah, but you know what, though?  When you get the first ding, then instead of parking really far away, now what are you doing?  You're squeezing into spots that you probably shouldn't be squeezing into.  You're attempting parallel parking that you shouldn't be attempting. 
[00:06:30]  This is good.  What's a couple of dings on the bumper?  That's what bumpers are for.  But that's what I'm saying.  You get upset, and then it's actually a good place to be.  Then it's over.  I wrote down a bunch of things because we were rocking here before the show started.  The hole-in-one.  Oh.  Wow.  So Travis writes me because he knows I'm a golf fan.  You know, he writes the news thing for all of us, and then he wrote me a little side email.  He's like, did you see the hole-in-one at the Canadian Open?  I'm like, what?  Canadian Open is... 
[00:07:00]  Who cares?  Who gives a crap?  Pretty much all the big stars that play golf in America, they don't go up to Canada for the Canadian Open.  No.  Wow.  For whatever reason, if I was a Canadian, I'd be insulted because the big guys just don't go and play that tournament anymore.  It's Canada.  But Travis goes, did you see the amazing hole-in-one at the Canadian Open?  And if you're a golf fan, I mean, it's cool to see a hole-in-one, but you're not going to go out of your way to, like, search them out.  No.  But Travis is like, no, you really got to see this one.  I'm like, what?  What?  What?  All right.  So it's a par three. 
[00:07:30]  The ball lands on the green.  Backs up.  Goes in the hole.  Wow.  Yeah, you figure it was one of those backspin ones.  I mean, they're the pros, so it happens more often than, obviously, the weekend golfer.  Yeah.  And then we got in here today, and Travis was like, no, you really have to see this.  Do yourself a favor.  How do we get there?  You got to see this hole-in-one from the Canadian Open.  Travis is right.  Basically, the guy lands on the green.  Who was it?  This is Leif Olsen.  Leif Olsen.  Okay.  Lands on the green.  And it was for a car.  It was one of those holes where they have the car sitting just off the green. 
[00:08:00]  Tee off right there.  The ball backs up.  Nice spin.  Bounces off the other guy's ball that hit before him.  And lands in the hole.  And then rolls into the hole.  He basically did a bank shot in golf.  Yeah.  Bocce.  And I'm like, and I go, when did this happen, Travis?  I thought this was like 10 years ago.  It was just one of those videos on YouTube that never goes away.  Yeah.  He goes, no, this happened over the weekend.  Like, the greatest hole-in-one ever happened over the weekend.  I mean, you show me one that's better than that. 
[00:08:30]  And look, he wins a nice Beamer.  Yeah, and there's the car right off the green that he just won for the hole-in-one.  She gives him the keys right there.  Imagine if he just peeled out and ruined the golf course and drunk drove into somebody.  He's doing donuts on the green.  It was a public relations disaster.  He got drunk and started yelling, like, anti-government sentiments.  You think it was racial epithets as he's dragging somebody in a circle.  He bones a golf cart and just killed everybody. 
[00:09:00]  I love how he said it was a public relations disaster.  Oh, really?  The people at BMW can't be happy with this.  Right.  They're distancing themselves.  The golf organization.  Everyone's distancing themselves.  And this man is.  But the actual hole-in-one was so amazing, maybe they let the guy go, you know.  Yeah, they're like, well, I guess we have to let him keep the car, technically, even though  he did use it in a vehicular mental order.  You guys aren't golf fans like myself.  I am.  Although Ed likes to play every once in a while.  Play badly.  But that's pretty fucking amazing, right?  Even for someone that's not into golf? 
[00:09:30]  A bank shot.  Yeah.  I didn't do that.  So it's Leif Olsen, amazing hole-in-one.  Leif Olsen.  The best ever golf.  Wow, this guy doesn't know how to name his video.  Jesus Christ.  If you just search Olsen hole-in-one, that's the first thing.  Because then they have the weird date where it's 25-07-2009.  Oh, yeah.  The 25th day of 07.  And then he writes HD in the title.  So you'll find it.  But it's definitely worth it.  It's worth checking out. 
[00:10:00]  And then the other thing.  Oh, the fat B-roll we enjoyed.  Yeah, yeah.  We can't get enough of fat B-roll.  Whenever the news does a story about fat, what makes you fat, medical repercussions of being fat, people that like fat, fat, fat, fat.  They show what is called B-roll in the business.  It's when they just send some guy out with a camera and they give him instructions like, hey, get some video of fat people.  But here's the very important part. 
[00:10:30]  We know they're never going to sign a release.  So you can't get their face in it.  So it's neck down, fat people.  And it's just them eating.  Like you see them holding an ice cream cone or sitting on a bench walking with giant fat asses.  And we always wonder if people go, oh, my God, that's me.  Of course they do.  It's like I know those pants with that big fat ass in it.  Yeah.  That's me.  But the fat B-roll is just terrific.  One of my favorite B-rolls is fat B-roll.  Fat B-roll. 
[00:11:00]  Fat B-roll.  Yeah.  It's one of my favorites.  Of course.  Of course.  So they were rolling that this morning.  I don't know why, but who cares why?  Yeah.  Who cares?  It's more fat B-roll to watch and laugh at.  Speaking of fat, one of your favorites growing up is a fat pig now.  Oh, no.  And we interviewed her many years ago, and she was a piece of ass.  You've got to be talking about Marsha Brady.  Absolutely.  She's fat?  Yeah.  I saw her recently.  She is now wearing moo-moo dresses.  Ew.  She had a book come out recently. 
[00:11:30]  She looked good.  She was on Celebrity Fit Club.  I used to watch that show until they came up with Biggest Loser, which is a much better  show than Celebrity Fit Club.  Yeah.  Because Biggest Loser, they force you to live on a ranch for, I don't know, a month and  a half or so.  You can't do anything but hang out and lose weight, which makes the show amazing when  these guys are dropping ridiculous amounts of weight.  Celebrity Fit Club, they fly in LA once a week to do a couple dumb things, get weighed, and  then they go back to their regular lives.  Where they just eat like slobs. 
[00:12:00]  Our pal, Dr. Ian Smith, it was great for his career, but Biggest Loser is way better than  Celebrity Fit Club.  Anyway, Maureen McCormick was on there, and she lost some really good weight.  Yeah.  And then she went back to her regular life, and now she's a big fat pig again.  And one of those gossip shows yesterday did a piece on her, like now they went into her  kitchen, kind of like an intervention, and they went through her cupboards and her refrigerator.  It's got to be really embarrassing for a fat person, because now she's standing in her 
[00:12:30]  kitchen in her muumuu dress all awkward, as they're going through her cupboards and  going, oh, well, this isn't healthy, and ring dings and ice cream and this and that.  Just all sorts of horrific food that you shouldn't be eating.  But wouldn't you know they're going to go through your stuff and kind of make it better?  Like, I would have all like low-fat stuff.  I would have nothing incriminating.  That right there was America's little sweetheart.  She's not that bad.  She's chubby, but she's not like...  Well, that's not the recent picture, Jamie.  And even that, she's chubby.  Yeah, she's fatter than that.  You can't go through... 
[00:13:00]  You've got to uphold your Marsha Brady-ness.  Oh, my thyroid.  Oh, my thyroid.  You've got diamonds cutting her back.  Go help some psychopath put a fucking chair in his van, you piece of shit.  Every other...  This is a nice...  Goober from Whackbag.  Every other guy in the fat B-roll is wearing an O&A shirt now.  Yeah, that's true.  And then I watched a lot of TV over the weekend, because it's fun to have the flu in the summer. 
[00:13:30]  Especially on such a horrible day like Saturday was.  You don't have the flu in?  Well, I don't know.  I was starting to think swine flu, to be honest with you.  No.  I was sick all last week, but not too bad.  And then the sore throat hit Wednesday or Thursday.  And by Friday and Saturday, I couldn't move.  And I was on my fucking back just hanging around my apartment in the middle of summer.  It's infuriating. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  So I watched a lot of TV.  I'm totally fine now, so it must have been like a 24-hour bug or 48-hour, whatever.  Whatever was on that gum?  Huh?  Whatever was on that gum.  Going back to that gum again.  Yeah, that's it.  It was still worth it for the shock that I caused.  Lock Up.  You guys watch Lock Up?  Love Lock Up.  You do, right?  Yes.  That MSNBC, when there's nothing else on on the weekend, God bless them for having that  Lock Up.  They have like a marathon.  I watch nothing but prison shows, cop shows, detective shows, like the real ones. 
[00:14:30]  Not fucking fake, you know, CBS, CSI shows.  Just the real ones where, you know, things like that, cop shows, Cold Case Files.  Like all those shows are the best.  And Lock Up.  Yeah, I was, well, this one was on some California prison, I believe, over the weekend.  And I was thinking to myself, if you take the California prison and you take, you know,  the Rikers prison, and then you have some friendly competition. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, friendly.  See which prison is tougher.  I told Ed before the show, I'm like, where do these monsters live before they're caught?  Because they're the scariest people on earth.  Monsters.  With the tattoos all the way up to their, you know, their foreheads, and holy crap.  Would you be scared if you got in trouble?  Frightening.  Like, say it was for something non-violent, like do some kind of, let's say your agent made  a tax error, and you didn't even do anything criminal.  Oh my God.  And like, they said, look, you gotta go for a year, it's mandatory.  I would be butt raped as I was signing in. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, it would be over.  That's the first thing I was thinking.  I'm like, how the fuck would I avoid a butt raping?  Yeah.  Shit while you walk constantly.  Constantly walking shit like a horse.  You know something?  That wouldn't even help.  There'd be some guy who goes, I like shitty asses.  These guys were monsters, and prison, take away the crime and how much time they're doing  and all that, because, you know, that's a different discussion, obviously. 
[00:16:00]  But it seems being in prison is just exhausting.  Yeah.  You have to watch your back constantly, and they have the most mundane rules.  Like, in the real world, these rules, people would just laugh at you.  Like, in prison, if you use someone's chin-up bar, you're going to be killed.  Yeah, and why not?  You're going to be killed.  If you work out before they allow you to work out, and I'm not even talking about the prison.  Now, you go out in the yard, and it's time for the workout. 
[00:16:30]  Now, you have to wait for the gang, whatever gang runs the yard, to tell you it's time to work out.  And usually, you have to work out in a group.  And there's, like, secret, like, exercises and all this crap.  It just seems exhausting.  You just can't be a guy that just wants to do his time, go out, work out a little bit, walk around.  You've got to, like, be in a gang.  You're constantly looking over your shoulder.  It's like the gazelle at the waterhole thing, you know?  You're constantly, like, and you look around, like, it's going to bite my throat out today. 
[00:17:00]  They're explaining you've got to be careful how you look at people.  And everyone knows this, but you're like, all of a sudden, you look the wrong way.  You know, you look up, and, oh, my God, I'm looking right into this guy's eyes.  I didn't mean to.  Oh, I disrespected him.  I'm dead.  Now I've got to, like, make him a weapon.  I would walk right over there.  I'm telling you guys, it's about staying in shape.  I'd walk right over there with my headband on, and I'd get into, like, an Olivia Newton-John type of workout.  Oh, that would be good. 
[00:17:30]  Where I'd shadow box and lay on my side and lift my one leg.  It'd be really a hit.  I would get a step platform with leggings and a headband and pink wristband and do step.  And one, and two, and three, and four.  And that's how many dicks are going into you.  I know.  One, and two, and...  Come on, you sodomites, get up.  I like the guys that go, that old cliche, first thing you got to do, you find the biggest guy in there.  Oh, yeah, okay.  You walk up to him and just kick his ass.  You punch him in the face. 
[00:18:00]  And then he beats you and rapes you, and everybody sees that you can't fight.  I'd find a small man and beat him.  Find the oldest guy in a wheelchair and tip it over and say, now what, motherfucker?  Whoever says that just doesn't know what prison's all about.  They'll kill you for that.  Of course they would.  Of course you're so dead.  You don't walk up to the biggest guy.  Biggest guy, you punch him in the face, you knock him out, and then you fucking, you know, walk away.  And, yeah, that's going to work.  And then you go to prison, you got to join a gang if you weren't in a gang on the outside.  And then they interviewed over the weekend a guy, he's a white crip. 
[00:18:30]  Wow.  Let that sink in a little bit.  I didn't know they were equal opportunity.  You're in prison where there's racism.  If you're black, you hang out with your fellow blacks.  If you're white, you know the deal.  Yeah.  Here's a white crip.  And he goes, yeah, when the blacks get into it with another group in the prison, I have to, you know, I have to fight alongside with the blacks.  Mm-hmm.  Yep.  A white crip.  A white crip.  In prison, of all places. 
[00:19:00]  That doesn't make any sense.  But that lockup rules, man.  Show rules.  Yeah.  All those shows.  What the hell is that watching?  I was watching another one that comes on after Cops, after I watched about three hours straight of Cops.  Yeah.  Which is just, I never get tired of that show because it's just hysterical.  And that's equal opportunity also because you could have fun with the dopey black car thieves that never fess up to anything.  Even as they're dragging them out of a stolen car that they just chased. 
[00:19:30]  The guy looking up at the camera going, I didn't do nothing, but I didn't do nothing.  And then the toothless, mulleted, shirtless, beer in his hand, white trailer park trash.  That is constantly in an argument with his neighbor, who is also drunk, shirtless, coming out with his wife.  There was one where this guy slashed the other guy's tires because he wouldn't drive them somewhere.  Meanwhile, they're both hammered fucking drunk.  And then the wife comes out and says, get in the house.  Come on, get in the house. 
[00:20:00]  And the guy's like, I don't care.  Take me to jail.  Take me to jail.  I'm like, you want to go to jail?  He's like, I don't care.  I'll be out in 10 minutes.  They go, no, it's going to be a little longer than that.  Turn around.  And then another black guy was in his room.  And he's going, shoot me there.  Shoot me.  I don't care.  Take out your nine.  And it's like, how do these cops not just shoot him?  Because he's a big guy.  And you're looking on, all right, you know this is going to end with that big struggle. 
[00:20:30]  And them trying to get his hands behind his back.  And it did.  And this guy had, like, big arms on him and everything.  They got him down.  There was, like, three or four cops it took to get this guy down.  But you watch this.  You just go, oh, my God, this is fantastic.  There are men out there.  I love it.  There's a guy I saw on a prison show.  It was a guy, a black guy.  And he used to break handcuffs.  Did we talk about that guy?  Oh, shit.  I think we might have mentioned him once.  But go ahead.  He did.  Do it again, yeah.  Push-ups.  No, but I think you and I off-air talked about it.  He's the guy who did.  He was mentally not. 
[00:21:00]  He was not a bright guy.  But he was trying to be, like, pleasant.  But he was just a murderous guy.  Like, they said that you couldn't cuff him because he would literally break cuffs.  He was just like, it's like, how do you deal with a man of that ilk?  That's like fucking Kong.  It just breaks the, those are high tens of steel chains.  No worries.  No worries.  I was going to say, I mean, the cops, I'm amazed they're not shooting more.  I know.  Because when you come upon one of these guys that could break handcuffs, why wouldn't you just, 
[00:21:30]  like, pull out your, you know, your piece?  Well, that's why a lot of times, you know, they got to kind of beat him into submission.  They were on the ground so they could get the cuffs on.  But like you said, you need three or four officers.  And sometimes even in that case, it's a tough fight.  Three or four officers.  I like the leverage move, too, where they take their nightstick and they jam it under the  guy's arm and use it as leverage to pull the guy's arm back.  How do they do that?  They, like, put it here.  His arm's behind his back, kind of.  His arm's behind his back a little bit, but they got to get it closer together. 
[00:22:00]  And they put it in, like, where his elbow is.  Between his arm and elbow?  And then the fulcrum would be on his back.  And then they just pull that fucker back.  That's why they're shaped like that, right?  Wow.  Amazing.  It's fantastic to watch, but man, what a thankless fucking job.  Oh, it sucks.  I wouldn't want to just touch those people.  This lockup.  Horrible.  And then there's a problem, and then the correction officers have to put on the gear. 
[00:22:30]  I'm like, oh, why?  And they pull the shield out.  Oh, my God.  But that's probably for cops, though.  At least there's eight of you, and you all have gear on.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, that's not as bad.  It's like when you're individually, you have to deal with somebody who's got a problem.  Yeah.  On this show, when you see them put the gear on, you can see it in their eyes, like, oh, this  isn't going to be fun.  Yeah.  And then everyone's like, are you ready?  Everybody, and they're in, like, a little wedge.  They open that cell door, and they get, oh, my God.  And then the one guy with the pepper spray, and the other guy, it's just, it's like, we 
[00:23:00]  got to deal, can't this guy just go to the mess hall in peace?  Stop throwing your shit at everybody.  That's what they do, too.  Yeah, they'll piss shit out on you.  I just went to bed scared.  I'm like, where are these monsters?  Yeah, before they're in prison, they're out.  They're out doing their thing.  Here's a retired correction officer.  Sir, I don't have your name.  Mike.  Hey, Mike.  What's up?  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah, I was listening to you talk about, like, if you use equipment, you'll get messed up.  No, what it really is, the worst thing is the telephone, you know, because they have 
[00:23:30]  slot time.  The convicts will have slot time, like the ones that are trying to run the house.  And a mate will come in, there won't be no one on the phone.  They'll get on the phone, and then he gets cut.  And they'll slice him from, like, his ear all the way down to his chin.  Wow.  But, you know, if you're a white boy, it's pretty hard on Rikers Island.  I mean, I retired in 2004 because the whites are very outnumbered there.  So they usually will hang out with the Spanish. 
[00:24:00]  But, yeah, I mean, the raping thing, I've never really seen much of that.  The only ones that ever, you know, raped were actually homos.  You know what I'm saying?  But, like, the raping thing, I've never seen it.  But as soon as you walked into the housing area, and this is back in, like, the 80s  and the 90s, but as soon as you walked into the housing area, if you were a white boy,  they'd surround you, they'd take your shoes, they'd take everything.  And if you voted a correctional officer, then you considered a snitch. 
[00:24:30]  Then they'll kill you.  But why do they allow that to happen?  I mean, I don't care, you know, if you got yourself in a prison, whatever.  But I'm just, like I said, that's a discussion for, you know, maybe later today or another day.  But why do they allow the white boy to just be completely surrounded and all his stuff taken away?  It's really hard.  I mean, it's really hard.  There's usually, like, in a dormitory setting, you've got 100 inmates on each side and one officer with them. 
[00:25:00]  So there's really not, you know, really that much you can do.  You know, I mean, you don't got no stick.  You don't got nothing.  I mean, now you've got pepper spray.  Years ago, you didn't even have pepper spray.  You just had your fist.  And, you know, you start fighting.  They had, like, a body alarm.  You pressed that.  And then the squad, the guy who suits up and stuff, they would come.  But you've got two minutes.  Hey, do they at least put the white boy in with another white boy?  Or even that's a hassle where they put you in with a black guy and, obviously, in prison, blacks hang out with blacks, whites hang out with whites. 
[00:25:30]  That's got to be a nightmare.  Rikers Island is a lot of dormitory settings.  And if you've got a cell area, there's only one person in the cell area.  It's like college, Toby.  See, because I'm at least thinking, like, all right, I've got my own cell.  So if I'm a little scaredy cat, I'll go to my cell.  But if you've got a dormitory setting, you can never rest.  Yeah, you can't do nothing.  I remember right before I got out, Mark Astino was in the prison I worked in. 
[00:26:00]  I was in C73.  And he was playing the MO house.  You know, he was all cracked out and stuff.  And I knew a guy, a friend of mine, who actually got a football sign for him, and he got fired.  Oh, really?  He got fired.  Hey, let me ask you a question.  I'm a 41-year-old guy, white guy.  Now, I go into Rikers Island for something.  Now, I'm not a violent guy.  I don't have a fight.  What is exactly my process when I walk in?  You can't walk in all of a sudden after 41 years, try to use my acting skills and pretend that I'm tough. 
[00:26:30]  It's not going to happen.  What happens?  What you were saying before, like, if you just commit your first crime, they got classification now.  Years ago, they just threw you in with the rest of them.  But now, it's like a classification system.  So, if you're, like, you know, you haven't been arrested before and it's a nonviolent crime, you won't be with murderers.  Because what was happening is you would have a guy that, you know, just got busted with a pound of pot who had to do six months.  And they're putting him in with a guy that's doing life, you know?  So, it got a lot better. 
[00:27:00]  They took care of Karrick, but not Karrick.  He fixed a lot of stuff.  But, I mean, if I have to confront that.  If I have to confront that situation, like, you're going to have to have a fight probably at least once.  Say, by the phones, I've got to make a phone call and I have a fight with a guy.  Now, if I fight that guy and get the shit beat out of me, what's the process?  Oh, let me just say he has a heart attack in the middle of it.  Then I win.  But I fight, he beats the shit out of me.  Now, is that guy going to beat the shit out of me every day? 
[00:27:30]  No, what they'll do is they'll move you to a different housing area.  Where another guy can beat the shit out of you.  You can request protective custody.  But if you did, like I said, if you just got into a housing area, white guy, 41, never been in jail before, and went to that phone, you're probably getting cut.  You know, they did not just beat off.  It's just exhausting.  And at least in the real world.  Oh, well.  They were very excited to be on the air.  Thank you for nothing.  I mean, the shivs they make are like ice picks because they try to puncture a lung. 
[00:28:00]  It's not like they have these big knives.  It's mostly small stuff so they can puncture your lung.  That's what they go for.  But how about if I said I needed to make a call?  Well, you'd have to pay somebody.  I needed to make a call.  If I said, look, you don't understand.  It's important.  You see, you can go to the officer and the officer will make you, let you use that phone.  But then you got to deal with them afterwards.  You see, that's what it is.  It's very hard for the officer to protect you.  You know, I mean, he's not there all the time or she's not there all the time. 
[00:28:30]  But you're highly outnumbered, you know.  So, yeah, I can get you on the phone.  Sure, I'll let you make a phone call.  But you got to deal with it afterwards.  Are you protected in protective custody?  You could sign in, but they don't let everybody go in.  But are you protected when you're there, though?  Is it pretty safe?  What, right?  Because I don't?  No, no, no.  In protective custody.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You know, pretty much.  You know, you're with guys that, you know, either, you know, just be afraid or, like, 
[00:29:00]  gang members, they don't want to be gang members no more.  They got to go into PC because then, you know, the other gang members will try to kill them  if they try to get out, you know.  Okay.  Or you can go to their home office.  That's like PC, too, you know.  A homo house.  A homo house.  Hello, welcome.  Yes, PC.  It's a plethora of cock.  Welcome to my humble home.  All right, guys.  I got to punch you out.  Thanks a lot, man.  Very informative.  There goes Mike.  Let's say hi to Dave in New Hampshire.  Dave.  All right, yeah.  Hi.  I'm just driving to work in a prison, and you're trying to scare the shit out of me. 
[00:29:30]  Do you work in a prison?  Yeah.  Where do you work?  What do you do?  Are you a guard officer?  No, I take care of the alarms and the video systems.  Oh, so you're just going in there for a job.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, but I mean, I go in and I spend a lot of time in and out of the yards.  I get to look at all the videotapes and things and make copies of them so they could send them to court. 
[00:30:00]  Can I tell you, I watched, at your recommendation, actually, I saw Tyson when I was away.  It was on the hotel pay-per-view.  When you were in Atlanta?  It fucking blew me away.  It was so fucking...  What about the filming of it, though?  I didn't even mind that.  Did it go over the top of the filming or not?  Maybe a little, but it wasn't as much as I expected.  I expected it to be a lot more than that.  Right.  A couple of little tricks I could have done without, but it didn't...  When all of a sudden there was three or four Tysons on the screen talking at the same time,  and then he's fading in and out. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  The filmmaking...  I thought...  Sorry.  I want your...  Sorry.  That's right.  I think he...  The filmmaking annoyed the piss out of me.  I thought the movie itself was amazing because Tyson...  We saw Tyson in a way we've never seen him before.  I think it was...  I was expecting that.  So I was like...  I think I expected it to be more than it was.  Right.  He probably did that just because he didn't want it to just seem like a boring interview.  I could have done without it, but it didn't bother me.  But Tyson was...  It was so fucking good. 
[00:31:00]  I couldn't believe that just interviewing this guy and the clips were...  It was moving, but it's talking about prison, and he admitted that he was scared when he was in jail.  And he's like, you see things there that you just can't believe one person is doing to another person.  And he was talking...  I actually now believe that he didn't rape Desiree Washington.  I always believed he did it until I saw him.  Wow, really?  Until I saw him go in that wretched, awful...  The way he talked about her, I'm like, no one rapes a girl and gets convicted and then just talks about her. 
[00:31:30]  He really hates her.  I'm with you.  Yeah.  I firmly believe he didn't do it.  How he talks about her, you're absolutely right.  I firmly believe he didn't do it now.  What an amazing movie.  Women's group theft to you.  Well, you realize that Tyson was...  Too bad.  I think he's interested in that.  Tyson is a smart dude.  And a lot of people are looking at their radios right now going, what?  Watch Tyson, the movie, or whatever the fuck the name of the movie is.  He comes across very intelligent and knows where he was, where he's been, and where he is today.  Yeah, it was a movie...  It was really...  It's like you really do see Tyson like you never saw him before. 
[00:32:00]  You see him as a regular guy, like even though he was this furious heavyweight and a feared guy.  What about the close-ups of his face where it's just all beat up now and kind of scarred and bloated?  And they shadowed it.  And you just remember the young Tyson that was like a fucking lion in there, man.  They shadowed it where you could see a little bit of his face tattoo.  But I think that he did that so when he was talking at times, you would only see the right side of his face.  So you would just see him as a man, like just as a guy talking about his life.  And it was well shot from the sides.  Like he had really weird angles on it, which I like. 
[00:32:30]  What did he say about the tattoo again?  He had something...  He just wanted a tattoo on his face.  He was going to get a bunch of hearts.  And he said that his friend said, let me find you this.  And it's a Maori thing.  There's a movie called Once for Warriors.  Right, right, right, right, right.  In New Zealand.  And this is kind of like that type of a Maori.  It's a warrior tattoo.  Right.  And it doesn't...  I mean, it fits Tyson's face.  You got to kill himself a warrior.  Sure.  But he was actually very sad at times.  And like he got choked up talking about Customato and this guy who saved his life.  It was really a fucking great movie, man.  Awesome. 
[00:33:00]  The phone's still lit about lockup.  Brandon, Atlanta.  Good evening.  Hi.  Hey, Brandon.  Hello.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  I've got a couple quick things for you.  Well, I don't know how it is in New York, but in Georgia there's two different types of prison.  The first one you get to is a diagnostics and classification prison.  That's the dangerous one.  Then you get your permanent camp, and that's not so bad except for the COs, the correctional officers.  Well, I went into diagnostics.  That is the most scariest thing you'll ever do in your life. 
[00:33:30]  It's frightening.  But the first day I was there, I had a tattoo on my arm that was a stupid fucking Pisces symbol,  and it resembled a symbol that the folk gang uses.  Oh, no.  And because I had had a previous drug addiction or a mental problem, they classify that as a mental problem.  So when you get there, they throw you into a cell block that is for people who have mental disorders.  So I got stuck in there with all of the complete lunatics on my first day. 
[00:34:00]  And a lot of the gang members are also in that area.  Well, they see the little symbol, and I wasn't particularly given a choice to join.  It was, you are going to join, and it was in the shower area.  We had double sales.  And once I went down to take the shower, the second day that I was there is when they saw it.  And pretty much they don't give you a choice.  You join or you get disabled or whatnot. 
[00:34:30]  So I had to join in a series of local initiations that you have to do, and you get, of course, the hell bit out of you.  And then once they classify, they send you off to your permanent camp.  And, you know, it's not so bad except for the CO officers, and they'll drag you out of your bunk by your feet sometimes in the middle of the night for count if you don't wake up.  That hurts a little bit.  I would probably ask that they don't do that.  I would say, look, you're disrupting my sleep.  I have a bad enough sleep as it is.  Yeah.  You have to put your foot down.  Yeah, you really do. 
[00:35:00]  How long were you in there, Brandon?  Two years.  Two years for what, if you don't mind me asking?  I don't mind at all.  Well, it was basically home invasion, but I got it dropped down to just a regular residential burglary, so it's 30, level 30-mile-an-crime is what I consider it in Georgia.  All right.  Now you're in Ant's wheelhouse.  Yeah, right?  We talk about home invasions all the time on this show.  Weren't you worried that the homeowner had a gun?  Well, it wasn't a situation like that.  I didn't know.  We weren't robbing the guy, per se, because we just wanted to rob somebody. 
[00:35:30]  He kind of hurt in front of me.  So I was drunk, and I did a crystal meth, so I went over to his house.  Well, I heard ODUS, crystal meth.  Crystal meth.  There's all kinds of stuff going to happen.  All right, Brandon.  I'm shocked.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Let's go to Drew in D.C.  Drew.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  What's up?  All right.  I got busted going to Walter Reed for a medical appointment with a gun on me. 
[00:36:00]  I was moving down to my new duty station, and Walter Reed was within an eighth of a mile  within D.C. limits, and at the time, you couldn't have a gun.  So I get busted for a felony and then put into D.C. central lockup with a bunch of murderers  and tweakers wearing a Hawaiian shirt and khaki pants.  Ah, and not quite prison garb.  Yeah.  I had to buddy up with the guy that had, you know, savagely beat his girlfriend. 
[00:36:30]  Was, like, the only person I could really talk to.  All right.  All right.  You know, we've been circling around here, and we got the bit now.  Drew just nailed it.  I want to hear from the guys out there that ended up in a pretty serious prison and had  a buddy up with some horrific animal to save your own life, and you were only in there  for whatever, pod or some lower charge.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Here's a guy that had a buddy up with who again, Drew?  The guy that beat his girlfriend. 
[00:37:00]  Beat his girlfriend.  And now you have to be best friends with this guy for your own survival.  Yeah.  Well, you know what?  You have someone in the studio that went through that.  Jimmy Norton.  Spent a night in the lockup.  Stick that chest up.  Yeah, you know.  Nice and high there, Jimmy.  Spent a night in a joint, and I had to buddy up with a guy you may know him, Louis Black.  Yep.  Yes.  We watched each other's backs.  Right.  While we were being raped.  He watched me get raped.  I watched him get raped.  You were in the tombs, right, Jimmy? 
[00:37:30]  Yeah, it sucked.  It's kind of scary, no?  What was scary was, I knew we were getting out, but I was like, what if we have to stay  for the week?  I had to shit.  That was the worst part of it, and I wanted to smoke.  Dude, I would have shit.  I don't care.  I couldn't.  If I had to, I would have.  I would risk my life to take a shit in front of other people, because I can't hold that  stuff.  I can't hold that in.  I didn't want to.  After a while.  There's roaches on the fucking bathroom floors.  That was terrible.  You were actually looking at roaches running around?  They were all over the place.  It was terrible.  It smelled in there.  It was just very unpleasant.  You didn't shit, though? 
[00:38:00]  Nah, I didn't, because I knew, I had a feeling I was getting out Friday.  We got arrested Thursday night at like 6, 6.30?  Couldn't even imagine.  And then we were out by Friday at like 8, but that, like, we just made it out.  I made a Dangerfield spot 20 minutes later.  My balls were stinking.  Friday, 8 o'clock at night.  P.M.  Yeah, it was 27 hours.  27 hours in the joint.  And, uh, no, it was like 5 o'clock on Thursday.  Yeah.  And I just made a Dangerfield spot that night, I remember, and I went and shit in the Dangerfield  bathroom.  I had to go so badly.  I could not even imagine having to just shit on an open toilet like that. 
[00:38:30]  And they say, yeah, they say the tombs are pretty, pretty intense.  Well, there was guys in there.  The thing was, you see guys, I don't think guys in that particular area, there were guys  there that didn't seem to want to fight a lot, um, because you're going to court from  there.  But, uh.  So you kind of want to, you know, you kind of want to stay under control because you  are going to see a judge eventually.  Yeah.  I mean, we had the cops.  That's probably not the best place to start a fight when you're going in front of the  judge.  Luckily, we had the cops loving us, too, because they all knew what was going on, and, you 
[00:39:00]  know, they're all ONA fans.  So at least we had them.  Those guys kind of kept us all in one area, and we had to mix a little bit, though.  We went up right before court.  They put you in a little cell right before you walk in to see the judge.  We were there for a few hours, and you're there with convicts.  And, uh, they were all, again, low, low criminal guys.  They weren't fucking gang members in for shootings, but it was fucking frightening,  man.  It was frightening.  I guess some guy told me to put toilet paper on my finger and shove it up my ass if I  had to shit.  He goes, that will help you.  Stop.  Oh, they give you all pointers.  Yeah, I got some prison advice on how not to make a doo-doo. 
[00:39:30]  That's nice.  That is nice.  Let's go to Jimmy in Florida.  Jimmy.  Yes.  How's it going, guys?  Hey, Jimmy.  Hey, Jimmy.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, sweetheart.  So, uh, oh, you were talking before about how the prison system in the U.S. is pretty  fucked up.  Have you ever watched that show, Locked Up Abroad?  I have not seen Locked Up Abroad.  Have you, Ann?  Locked Up Abroad.  Yeah, I saw that when it was that one woman that was smuggling weed or something and said  she didn't know it was in a bag. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, in Indonesia?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Lost Chapelle, her name was, I think.  Ah.  You think that would be a bad place to be locked up, Indonesia?  She got 20 years, luckily.  Yeah.  They put you to death for that.  That's death.  Horrible.  Oh, amazing.  Uh, what do you got on that, Jimmy?  Uh, nothing.  Just bring it up.  I'm sorry.  Okay.  You know what?  No, I'll take a peek on your recommendation.  That was a poo-poo moment.  That's okay.  I'll take a look at that.  I'll have a full report.  Thanks, Jimmy.  Full report.  All right.  Thanks.  Uh, here's a Nazi Jew. 
[00:40:30]  What?  Are you a Nazi Jew, it says?  Oh, yeah, you can say that.  You can say that.  All right.  What do you got?  Uh, look, I was locked up about, uh, 20 years ago on a fucking weed charge.  I got set up by a buddy of mine.  Got sent to, uh, state prison in Atlanta, Georgia.  Uh, actually, south of Atlanta there.  Uh, and, uh, had to buddy up with some guys that, uh, were in there for murder.  Had a disturbing double wife, uh, for murder.  I think he murdered his girlfriend.  But while I was in there, uh, I kind of met, but didn't want to talk to, the Atlanta child murderer. 
[00:41:00]  Wayne Williams, the guy that killed all the kids.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I wasn't going near that dude.  I was kind of in the same vicinity.  That, that dude was tiny, man.  His wrists were like fucking, you gotta put my hand, like, my fingers around his wrists.  I don't see how he could have done what they said he did.  I mean, I'm sure he did.  It's children.  It's still children.  I mean, you got the upper hand.  Well, they were also...  Well, no, some of them were like 18 or something.  Young men, yeah. 
[00:41:30]  But he also, um, he might have drugged them or something.  Again, you could put something in someone's drink if you get them to trust you, and then  once they're out, you can do what you want.  There's a little holes in their head.  Drano in there.  They electrocuted somebody while I was there.  Sorry.  Who did that?  Jeffrey Dahmer.  Oh, yeah.  They electrocuted somebody while I was there, and the lights actually do dim, or they did  it.  Wow, nice.  That's probably...  That's crazy, man.  That's probably the boys just fucking with you guys.  All right, just flicker the lights a little bit.  Yeah.  Yeah, right.  You know, they're probably just fucking with you.  Fuck with them. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, Jeffrey Dahmer wanted to actually make, like, zombies.  He wanted to make sex zombies.  Jesus.  Out of his little boy toys that he'd bring home, so he drilled holes in their head, just  to power...  While they were alive.  Yeah, while they were, like, drugged, but they weren't knocked out drugged.  They were just kind of...  He drilled holes in their head, and then, like, pour, like, Drano in there and other things  to try to...  Slow them down.  ...fuck their brain up so he could make them just sex slaves for him.  Without him.  But then, you know, it always ended, well, I guess now I gotta kill you and put your 
[00:42:30]  head in a pot.  And boil it.  Eat your jowls.  He wasn't a good boy.  No.  Jeffrey was a fresh boy.  He was very naughty.  You think he had problems, Jimmy?  That's a guy with fucking major problems.  Major problems?  Major.  I heard he was killed in jail.  It had nothing to do with his crimes.  I heard it was because he cut somebody on the lunch line or something.  He did something fucked up to somebody in jail.  Yeah, yeah, it wasn't even that...  That's exactly what we're talking about today.  Yeah, disrespecting.  Yeah.  You don't even know you're disrespecting.  Unless you're focused, like, you know, 24 hours a day. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  You have to have that sharp focus.  This leads to Fleece Johnson.  Good old Fleece Johnson.  Danny brought to the show about a month ago, and look how it all comes together.  You want to meet Fleece Johnson?  Of course.  Sounds like a made-up name.  This was from a past lock-up show.  When lock-up visited Kentucky State Penitentiary, we met Fleece Johnson, a long-time inmate who  practices a very different kind of homosexuality. 
[00:43:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  We meet Fleece Johnson.  Yeah, this just isn't good.  You know, talking about homosexuality and eerie music at the same time, this can't be good.  This can't be good.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  What is Fleece Johnson into?  Of homosexuality.  But we have sexual desires, right?  So you got a bunch of men locked up in one place.  All of them get whore. 
[00:44:00]  All of them's haunted.  All of them got sexual desires.  So what are they going to do?  You won't let them have a woman.  They're going to have each other.  Somebody's going to have to give off some booty.  And it's just that simple.  The most memorable story that Fleece told us was about the place and importance that booty has in a maximum security penitentiary.  And he went on about it and on about it.  In this prison, booty. 
[00:44:30]  Booty was more important than food.  Booty.  A man's butt.  It was more important.  I'm sorry.  It was more booty.  Having some booty.  Was more important than drinking water, man.  Oh, my God.  I like booty.  I like booty. 
[00:45:00]  Booty.  Booty.  Booty.  Booty.  Booty.  Enough about the booty.  Oh, yeah, right?  When you give up the booty, you get all sorts of stuff in the joint there.  Danny, is that what they're saying, this Fleece Johnson?  I don't know about that.  No, I think he was just saying that it's just, it's, I think the desire is so, it just overcomes you.  And it gets to be to the point where being hungry and eating a sandwich, it's the same.  Jimmy, would you be booty guy, knowing they would just take care of you?  But they're not.  No.  What do you think?  They're nice to you.  They're just giving you an achy asshole. 
[00:45:30]  So this goes back to how this started.  So even if you go, all right, I'm going to be booty guy just because I'm exhausted.  Oh, you know, you're just getting fucked.  And I don't like looking over my shoulder anymore.  I'm just going to be booty guy.  You're just getting fucked.  They still fuck you up.  Yeah.  Because I get, my luck, I get the one who wanted to kiss, too, after.  Oh.  Like, who'd want to trail spit between our mouths and who'd want to hold my face in this fucking angry, dirty prison hands.  It's like, what do you think?  You're getting respect for letting another man put his cock in your ass?  You're getting no respect.  So no matter what, it's just exhausting. 
[00:46:00]  You're done.  Just exhausting.  Johnson went on to tell our crew how he used to satisfy his sexual desires.  Especially during the 1970s and 80s, when he was most active and prison security was more lax.  When I see Warren, and he looks good to me, when I go see him, I say, you come here.  I say, I'm telling you what, I like you, and I want you. 
[00:46:30]  And, uh, we can do it the easy way or the hard way.  So the choice is yours, right?  And it was always yes.  Johnson also had a warning for the new generation of inmates.  They might be asking for trouble from old timers.  You know, they got this thing where they sagged their pants past their butt.  It's a style.  They call it some sort of a gangster style. 
[00:47:00]  You know, it's sexual to us, right?  And see, but they weren't prepared for this, right?  So you sagged your pants in here, man.  Somebody be up in your butt.  Oh.  Jesus.  So if you wear your pants low slung, the old timer's going to be like, yeah, I like that.  But what is the different kind of homosexuality he was talking about?  He likes to fuck butts.  That's pretty gay 101.  Isn't he the one that talked about tossing salad?  No, that was a gay guy.  This is, uh... 
[00:47:30]  No, no, there was a guy that talked about not him licking ass, but somebody else licking his ass.  Yeah, putting grape jelly in it, right?  Yeah, yeah.  There was a gay guy, I think, in an HBO documentary, Tossing Salad.  Was it gay?  I believe so.  Spectro from Michigan writes, this sounds like a Saturday Night Live skit.  Yeah.  Johnson even let the lockup crew know that when he was in his prime, they wouldn't be safe from his advances either.  Stop.  If y'all had been in her back then in them days, and as much as I like booty, I'd probably felt one of y'all butts. 
[00:48:00]  And y'all would walkin' past me.  And there's you to say so.  I'm not no shame in my game.  This is nothing that I'm ashamed to admit.  I am what I am.  But I'm a warrior, too.  You know, so...  Let that be known.  I'm a warrior.  Warrior.  The thing that's...  Here's the music.  The thing that I didn't need.  All he said is, when one of y'all walked by, I'd have grabbed your butt.  Yeah. 
[00:48:30]  So he'd have grabbed...  I'd have feel insulted if he didn't.  Yeah, I'd have giggled and said, cut it out, you.  What's the matter?  He doesn't like my butt?  What's wrong with me?  That's what I would have...  Grabbed my butt.  No way.  No how.  There's fleece Johnson.  Mr. Grabbin' butt hands.  Yikes.  Yeah, salad toss guy was...  This is the guy.  I think this was an HBO show, I think.  Oh, is this a toss salad guy?  Yeah, it should be.  This guy's great.  First of all, right, if you're the newcomer, right, I want him to suck my ass with jelly.  That's what they call toss a salad.  That's the slang word, toss a salad. 
[00:49:00]  It means sucking my ass, right?  With jelly or without jelly, some people use syrup.  I prefer a guy to use jelly, right?  I will reach my climate, right?  I will automatically get hard, right?  I will, you know, cum automatically if he's sucking my ass for about 10 minutes or longer, right?  It's a sensation feeling, and it makes you feel real good.  Most all gays do that, you know what I'm saying?  Like guys that suck their ass.  It's just like a pussy, right?  But the only difference is it's not a pussy, right?  It's clean. 
[00:49:30]  The person's decent.  And the person knows that that's an asshole, but in mine, he's looking at it as a pussy because he's in prison.  So toss my salad.  Let him eat me, you know, and we straight.  That's it.  That sounds reasonable.  Do we hear that?  He makes it sound reasonable.  See, he didn't need the...  Oh, it's all the ominous eating ass music.  Can we hear that same clip with the Benny Hill music? 
[00:50:00]  Travis, you play the Benny Hill music over there, and let's see if it sounds a little different.  Are you spelling Benny B-E-E-N-I?  Don't be Travis.  And don't find the live version.  I know.  Make it longer.  It's called Yakety Sax, if you can't find it on the Benny Hill.  I don't know where Eric puts it.  It's called Yakety Sax?  Yakety Sax.  Oh, that's funny.  Yeah, it is.  Yeah, because it's like...  It's a sax, I guess. 
[00:50:30]  Where's Eric?  It's like a salad.  It's like a pussy.  Here we go.  Only it's a sticky asshole.  First of all, right, if you're the newcomer, right, I want him to suck my ass with jelly.  What they call toss a salad.  That's the slang word, toss a salad.  It means sucking my ass, right?  With jelly or without jelly.  Some people use syrup.  I'm afraid they gotta use jelly, right?  I will reach my climate, right?  I will automatically get harmed, right?  I will, you know, come automatically.  If he's sucking my ass for about 10 minutes or longer, right? 
[00:51:00]  It's a sensation feeling.  It makes you feel real good.  Most all gays do that.  You know what I'm saying?  Like guys to suck their ass.  It's just like a pussy, right?  But the only difference is it's not a pussy, right?  It's clean.  The person's decent.  And the person knows that that's an asshole.  But in mine, he's looking at it as a pussy because he's in prison.  So toss my salad.  Let him eat me, you know.  We straight.  That's it.  That's it.  That's it.  See, it does add a fun little aspect to it. 
[00:51:30]  Steven S. from Bayshore is first of the week.  He writes, toss my salad.  We straight?  Straight?  I have to disagree, sir.  There's nothing straight about that.  Yeah.  That guy's little conversation.  All right.  Off to a good start.  So we're going to talk about the Obama beer thing.  Yeah.  And the wrong way, lady.  Holy shit.  A tragedy in the New York area.  I don't know how that happens.  Eight people dead because of a dummy.  New York?  Oh, okay. 
[00:52:00]  A little north of here, Jimmy.  Not too far.  Oh, one happened in Georgia, too.  Something wrong way on the highway.  That's what I thought.  What?  There was one in Georgia, too?  A big one.  It's all over the place.  A guy going to a family reunion from Queens.  That's why I think it was ridiculous.  What the fuck?  All right.  We're going to step aside.  Opie and Anthony and Jim Norton is back from Atlanta.  For a couple hours.  I leave at noon, nine.  You're at noon, nine?  Noon, nine.  Yes.  It's noon somewhere.  You're shooting today, right?  I know.  I shoot tomorrow, but I have to go up today for fittings and script and all that stuff.  Jimmy is shooting a movie.  I know.  And this isn't a one-liner thing. 
[00:52:30]  No, I don't have a huge part, but I got a few.  I'm back on Friday.  Big enough.  Then I go back up next week, I think.  It's big enough that you got a couple weeks ahead of you of filming.  That's cool, man.  Yeah, I'll see what Brendan wants to do.  I mean, I'm not sure what stuff he wants to do.  Oh, really?  Who?  Yeah, you know, it's just Brendan, whatever.  We'll see.  Brendan.  He's in Crash.  Holy shit.  Jimmy is taking off.  It's about fucking time.  I'm sputtering in a circle.  No, you're taking off.  It's about fucking time.  All right, we're going to step aside. 
[00:53:00]  Opie Anthony, Jim Norton.  77-year-old gets transgender operation.  Yeah, that's a good time to decide you want to fucking have your dick cut off.  I'm just looking through some of the news stories today that we could touch on.  Isn't that shit for the young?  Absolutely.  I mean, really.  I've seen some that really are passable.  And I assume that they looked very, in my house, after paying huge amounts of money.  And I assume they looked probably very, very feminine as men. 
[00:53:30]  And then you decide, you know, yeah, you're going to have the operation.  Everything works.  You have the hormone there.  Danny just found the guy.  Looks like Harry Dean Stanton.  Avenge me!  Why would you want to look like an old lady at 77 years?  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  Now, I might be biased, but I think it's better to be an old guy than an old woman.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  When you see the young guys do it, like I said, they probably looked very feminine to begin with. 
[00:54:00]  Right.  And then there's that one.  What is that?  That German teen fucking transgender now.  Is it German?  And it's got blonde hair and stuff.  That, like, you could tell, like, the guy must have looked like a chick beforehand.  But that looks like your fucking shop teacher put a wig on.  There is no difference.  It's horrendous.  Horrendous.  Renee Ramsey, I guess we'll do this story right now, is recovering from the surgery that she's been dreaming of for decades. 
[00:54:30]  Since I was about 13, I always knew something was different, said Renee.  Renee Ramsey, she used to be Richard, a Green Beret specialist in Vietnam.  Are you kidding me?  Why is it always that?  A Green Beret specialist in Vietnam.  Oh, I went through the Nam, Green Beret.  He's not going to any reunions anytime soon, huh?  See, look, that right there.  Yeah, but we saw, like, the face is weird.  But I'm just saying there must have been a feminine look to the guy before that. 
[00:55:00]  Still smells like scrotum.  Ah, still fucking, you still be licking bag.  You could scrub all you want, but it still smells like scrotum.  They make the labia out of bag.  Right.  That's it.  So you're licking bag.  And it smells like bag.  So you got a Green Beret specialist in Vietnam.  Oh, boy.  A tough guy who privately dreamed of wearing dresses.  It was weird because as much as I wanted to dress like a lady, I didn't say anything. 
[00:55:30]  I knew if I did, I would be discharged, said Rene.  They knew during downtime when he would sit on the mortars.  Or ask him to just fire the mortars out of his ass.  Foom!  We're never going to grow up.  That's hilarious if you're 12 or if you're a shock jock.  It's never just the guy.  He's got to have something in his ass.  And you got to make sure it's the biggest, most ridiculous thing.  Anything cylindrical or penis-shaped.  We just think gay people want it in their asses. 
[00:56:00]  They want it in their ass.  So it's the Washington Monument.  I guess he wants it in his ass.  We just don't know anything about the gay lifestyle.  We just assume if you're gay, you want the biggest, fattest fucking thing in your ass.  Yes.  The most painful thing.  It's got to be pleasurable.  Explosive devices.  Why would he want to mortar up his ass in the nom?  So he would have been discharged.  She was in the military for over 20 years and married twice.  She says, Richard eventually started to dress like a woman but switched back into the uniform for official duties. 
[00:56:30]  Duty.  Renee is 77.  And while genital reassignment surgery is complicated, age as long as there are not medical problems, usually it's an issue.  Wow, that's a rough sentence right there.  A little odd.  Renee is 77, comma, and while genital reassignment surgery is complicated, comma, age, comma, as long as there are not medical problems, comma, usually isn't an issue.  It's a bit, that's written a little. 
[00:57:00]  Nothing with the commas.  Right, okay.  Renee says she waited until her wife died to have the surgery and finally feels normal.  I'm happy, good, as happy as any woman could be.  Woman, stop it.  The surgery can be expensive 20,000 Gs.  It's something that Renee has been saving for almost all her life.  Is it 20 Gs to have your dick cut off?  Well, cheap.  Can't they do something about the awful wig you got to wear, though?  They can't do anything about that.  They could turn your fucking dick and balls into a vagina, but, you know. 
[00:57:30]  I mean, he's 77, so you got to think he doesn't have much hair left.  So now he's got to wear the awful-looking wig to complete the look.  That is a horrible wig.  I don't get that one whatsoever.  No, that's for the young.  Eh, it's for the young.  What's sex for the young and transgender shit for the young?  That's like transgender lemon party is what that would turn into, how to see any sex with  that thing.  All the lemons and they cut them open.  Fold them inside out. 
[00:58:00]  Yes.  Well, there you go.  Well, we could go to the tranny mayor story.  Oh, good.  Taking a little heat for wearing a miniskirt.  Are we supposed to be more open about this?  No.  Lemon party with clothes on.  This is a safe-for-work lemon party.  Safe for work.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it's a cop and a fireman, and they're resuscitating him.  They drew, like, a little animated Microsoft paint clothes on them.  Thank God.  And the guy who's blowing the other guy, the other, the fireman's red is, like, kind 
[00:58:30]  of going into his mouth, so it just looks like he's yelling, while he's next to someone's  clothes, he's yelling, live, dang you.  All the fireman's very funny.  He goes mouth-to-mouth.  Live, dang you.  Dang you.  Well, it's got to be safe for work.  So you got a tranny, who's a mayor, and he, she, whatever, is taking heat for wearing  a miniskirt.  Yeah.  Come on.  You should be taking some heat.  No?  How open are we supposed to be in this society?  Pretty open now. 
[00:59:00]  For real?  How much shit do we have to just look the other way about?  What circumstance was the miniskirt being worn?  From this level, it's much to do about nothing, but it's the rest of the outfit that has stirred  up small-town life here in Silverton.  Stu Rasmussen, call him Stu, is the mayor here.  Oh, it's fun.  That's the story around town.  While in any other town, he'd be turning heads and drawing jeers, in Silverton, it's  perfectly acceptable. 
[00:59:30]  He's got nice legs.  It's harder than mine.  But when the mayor was invited to a youth leadership training meeting in this un-air-conditioned  basement, his outfit was this outfit.  Look at this guy.  He looks ridiculous.  Stop it.  You look ridiculous.  Stop it.  You're kidding me.  It's Sandy Kane.  You look ridiculous.  Eh, eh.  We're supposed to just go, okay, you're normal.  Yeah.  I'm sorry that I need to openly mock you and laugh at you.  Look, the guy's not just wearing a mini skirt.  This is a complete outfit with tits and- 
[01:00:00]  He's got fire red hair.  And painted fingernails and-  Oh, my God.  You look ridiculous.  What does he look like?  He looks like Robert Plant.  With long Sandy Kane hair.  Yeah.  With that face.  No, you don't have it yet.  Norman Fell.  There's somebody else.  Norman Fell.  It looks like.  That looks like fucking Mr. Roper.  Block out the hair for a second.  That looks like fucking Mr. Roper.  Or older, um, what's his name from Monty Python? 
[01:00:30]  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Now you're talking.  Come on.  What's his name?  Eric Idle.  Eric Idle.  Eric Idle with a fire red wig.  Dio.  Yeah, little Ronnie James Dio.  Any metal dude.  Still trying to look.  Still trying to put on a show.  Pull off the look.  I have to apologize, I guess.  I said 20,000 G's.  All right.  It's early.  20 G's.  20 G's.  I don't think you said 20,000 G's.  Did you?  I don't know.  I think I might have.  Come.  Whatever.  Up.  It's early.  You try to talk to us early. 
[01:01:00]  All you have to do is listen.  It's easy.  Jesus.  It's easy.  You can't make a mistake listening unless you start talking.  Give us a break.  You got to give us a break until 8 o'clock.  That's the new rule.  Then 8 o'clock, you can beat the shit out of us.  How's that?  Watch.  8 o'clock in one second.  Why do you think I just said that?  You suck.  I said that to set us up real nice.  All right.  So you got the tranny mayor.  That looks ridiculous.  Let's get back to the story here.  Meeting in this un-air-conditioned basement, his outfit, this outfit, caused the leaders  of a non-profit group to do more than blush. 
[01:01:30]  I just think in a business setting, that's inappropriate.  Yes.  Period.  With or without a dress code, I don't think that's an appropriate business attire.  There you go.  This should be a non-issue in Silverton.  I mean, the town is used to me as I am.  Hard to believe, but Stu Rasmussen used to dress like a man.  Khakis, lace shoes, you name it.  But he knew something was wrong, so he invested in a breast enhancement.  Ugh.  I like looking in the mirror and seeing a fairly attractive woman looking back. 
[01:02:00]  Ah, come on.  If you just count the face, an amazing looking woman.  Dude, I...  But with this outfit, he ruffled some feathers.  Still, he was blown away when the group followed a complaint.  And I got it.  Can you back up about 15 seconds in the video?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Did you see what I saw?  Pause it right there.  Who does that look like?  This will get us in a little trouble today, but who does that look like?  Wait, should I yellow flag you?  Look at the eyes.  Is it, uh...  I think I know who you mean. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, my God.  I knew it looked like someone.  Oh, oh, yeah, okay.  Wow.  You know something?  Yeah, yeah.  I could see it.  Let me see it.  I could see...  I could kind of see that.  Just put...  Nowadays.  Just put sunglasses on them.  I could kind of see that, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, a little fatter in the face, but...  The, uh...  The thing that's...  Who, who?  It's almost like you get fucking elected as mayor as a transgender.  How far do you have to push it? 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  Like, sorry, you have to dress like a politician now.  You're a politician.  Fucking act like one.  You can't walk around in a miniskirt when you're a politician.  But how are you supposed to get things done?  Hands in a hand suit.  Who's taking you seriously when you're really doing whatever a fucking...  I don't even know what a...  It's a spectacle.  I really don't even know what a mayor does, really.  Mayor.  They clean up the town, make it the best...  Really?  Do they?  Best mayor.  Or Hill Valley's ever going to see.  You've got to see the picture of this one.  Yeah, this is ridiculous.  And the fact that he thinks that he's a beautiful woman looking back in the mirror. 
[01:03:30]  I don't know what mirror he's looking at.  All right, more to the story.  I was surprised.  I was stunned.  And honestly, the organization, Silverton Together, is supposed to be committed to diversity.  And, you know, this amounts basically to bigotry.  No, it doesn't.  If he had a problem with his lifestyle, why would we have invited him in here?  His lifestyle is no secret.  We see him every day. 
[01:04:00]  And as I said earlier, you know, it's not the lifestyle I would adopt myself, but I support his right to that lifestyle.  According to CityCode, tank tops and miniskirts are inappropriate.  It's a code that Mayor Stu Rasmussen wants to get rid of.  It's not my policies.  It's not the intelligence and compassion that I bring to the job.  They worry about what I'm wearing.  I mean, how trivial.  How trite.  He suspects it's not about his outfit at all.  It's something deeper than that.  We found out the man we talked to didn't vote for Stu. 
[01:04:30]  In fact, he ran against him.  Absolutely not.  You know, politics is politics.  That could certainly be an undertone here.  So what will happen in this complaint?  That's up to the people of Silverton.  For now, you can count on one thing.  There will be another controversy.  It seems to follow Mayor Stu.  Of course it follows him because he looks ridiculous.  Fuck Mayor Silverton.  Mayor Stu looks silly. 
[01:05:00]  Oregon.  Oregon?  Mayor Stu got elected.  And now Mayor Stu just needs more attention.  It's almost like now nobody gives a shit.  All right, you're transgender.  You got elected.  Just do your job and fucking be like every other politician.  But no, you need a little more attention.  How about the way I dress?  Why don't you just walk around naked then?  If no one says anything about that.  You know what?  I think Jimmy nailed it.  It was the thing.  And then it turned out no one really gave a shit.  So then he's like really, really tramped it up.  Yeah, there's Mayor Stu. 
[01:05:30]  Mayor Stu just needs some fucking attention.  Mayor Stu looks ridiculous.  I like the rouge.  Like you're overdoing it with the rouge, Mayor Stu.  But then Mayor Stu hides behind the thing.  Like if you criticize Mayor Stu's outfit, you're not accepting Mayor Stu.  I love just saying Mayor Stu.  Is Mayor Stu a transgender or a transsexual or a transvestite?  I would imagine Mayor Stu still has the penis.  I don't know.  In a miniskirt, those Turkish taffy balls just hanging down.  Yeah.  Oh, come on. 
[01:06:00]  I mean, huh?  I don't know.  Because this article, I'm not sure where it's from.  On Mayor Stu?  But it says here that he's the nation's first transgendered town leader.  Transgender just means you wear a dress, right?  No, that's transvestite.  But I think transsexual and transvestite is in the transgender category.  Yes, transgendered is, I believe, the umbrella.  And they fall under.  Transgendered, I think, is the same as transsexual.  Am I wrong?  No, I think transvestite is also transgender. 
[01:06:30]  Transgender is the politically correct.  No, I don't think so.  I think it's transgender.  Can we get a date that says he cut his dick off?  Transgender, I think, is transsexual.  Yeah?  Transvestite is different.  And they voted this guy in as a transgender?  Which is a transsexual.  I know Oregon is pretty fucking liberal.  They, just like everything else we do in this country, remove the word sexual.  They're very.  And put it in gender.  Yes, gender.  But he really got elected as this thing? 
[01:07:00]  Because it said just breast enhancement.  It didn't say that he had this whole thing.  I'm going to guess he still has a dick.  He still has a dick.  That's transvestite.  I thought transgender would imply that you actually went through it.  Went through and changed your gender.  To me, transgender is someone who is now post-op to me.  That's what I always thought it was.  I just thought transgender was the whole thing that fit transvestite and transsexual.  But I think the confusion is maybe he got the breast enhanced.  I'm not sure.  Why wouldn't they say he went all the way in the story?  Yeah. 
[01:07:30]  I agree.  Transgender just means cross-gendered.  I mean, trans, I think, is cross.  Oh, here we go.  Mayor Stu is on, of all people, get the fuck out of here.  Larry King, can we please find that audio?  How important is the scrotum?  Yes.  Could I see your ball bag?  Hey, bubba boys.  Hey.  Hey, man.  I saw him just two days ago.  He was on Larry King.  Who?  Mayor Stu?  Dr. Drew is filling in for Larry King.  And he admitted he still has his cock.  Oh, that sucks.  And he's in a relationship with a woman.  And they asked about sex. 
[01:08:00]  And he said that's not an issue because it doesn't work because of his age.  So he just, so that's the scoop.  I don't know.  Mayor Stu is a disaster.  Mayor Stu is a mess.  What does Mayor Stu have sex with?  What does Mayor Stu do when he's naked?  Is he now, is he gay?  Is he straight?  Like, where is he at?  Who's he having sex with?  Oh, no.  Something tells me that if he's with a woman, there's a strap-on involved.  Would you?  Mayor Stu's getting it.  Hey, uh.  Look at the tits on Mayor Stu.  Punching out, boy.  That's Mayor Stu? 
[01:08:30]  Mayor Stu needs to simmer down.  Big, huge old lady bags.  Yeah, yeah.  He's got going on.  Simmer down, Mayor Stu.  Relax with the big tits there, Mayor Stu.  You could have went with bees.  Wear a pantsuit, Mayor Stu.  Now that you're Mayor.  Buy some conditioner.  He's got big fucking old lady boobs.  Jimmy, if Mayor Stu was, I don't know, a thing of the night, how much would Mayor Stu  get for a date, do you think?  Mayor Stu, if Mayor Stu was prostituting, Mayor Stu would go home with $1.70 every night. 
[01:09:00]  That's combined.  Mayor Stu would not be a hit.  Look at Mayor Stu's back fat.  Yeah.  It's wonderful.  Mayor Stu's unattractive, old, and with back fat.  Those are all negatives in the prostitution category.  I hate Mayor Stu.  And why would you want to put on makeup in your 70s?  Why would you want to put on makeup ever, but especially in your 70s, now you're just  like...  It makes Mayor Stu feel pretty.  Yeah.  With his dried out fucking riverbed lips.  Mayor Stu needs to cut the malarkey. 
[01:09:30]  He stinks.  I really wish Mayor Stu would just kind of stop looking for attention, put on a pantsuit,  and go do your job.  Yeah.  That's what Mayor Stu needs to do.  Mayor Stu needs to stop slinging bunk all over town and just settle down and get to work,  Mayor Stu.  Settle down.  Aaron.  Yeah.  He looks like Ruth Gordon.  Aaron.  Yeah.  Hi.  You're on the air.  What's up, man?  How are you doing?  I was thinking that you got to think that this was a goof. 
[01:10:00]  Like, people voted, you know, kind of like they vote for Ugly Girl for Homecoming Queen.  You know, Ugly Girl for Homecoming Queen the next morning.  They're reading the paper after election night, and they're thinking, what the hell did we  just do?  Yeah.  I don't really understand that one.  Mayor Stu looks like Kathy Griffin, mad at him from New Hampshire.  Oh, okay.  I can't stand Kathy Griffin.  Kathy Griffin.  I honestly think she's funny.  I know you do, Jimmy.  You don't like her?  She tries way too fucking hard. 
[01:10:30]  What is her show on the D-list or whatever it's called?  Ugh.  Hold on.  Yes, it is.  Know who rules?  Did you hear what Joan Rivers had to say about Michael Jackson?  Are you part of the roast on Comedy Central?  No.  Why would I be?  They fucking didn't call you for that?  You're perfect.  Comedy Central.  You've done a bunch of their roasts over the years.  I've done one.  They only called you for the Gene Simmons one?  No, that was A&E.  Comedy Central didn't even call me for Bob Saget's roast.  That was a Saget request.  So you did Saget's...  Only Saget's.  Because Saget's people called you. 
[01:11:00]  Requested me.  Because Bob requested me.  What's wrong with Comedy Central?  What the fuck is with them?  Vendetta?  What's going on?  I don't know.  I don't...  Look, I mean, their roasts always come off good.  I just...  For whatever reason, they've never taken to me.  Yeah.  I don't know why.  Aw.  They've...  Comedy Central has never taken to me.  I've never gotten...  Boo!  Well, I mean, I did Tough Crab for two years, which was great.  But that was Colin's request.  Saget's roast was...  And the HBO special they do run, but they kind of run most HBO specials.  Amazing.  That's ridiculous. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  You're perfect for the Joan Rivers roast.  That's all right.  What do they got?  Because I think that's right around the corner now.  I think it happened last night.  They...  I think Jeff Ross and Giraldo, who both will do great.  Absolutely.  Gilbert, who on all of them does great.  Cantone, who's probably a friend of them.  I think he'll do great.  Mario will do great.  And I don't know who else, actually.  But, yeah, the network has never fallen in love with me.  It is just the way it is.  I just assumed you were doing it.  No.  That's how stupid I am.  I've only done one...  Honestly, I think they've called me for that.  Again, if it wasn't for Saget, I wouldn't have even done that one. 
[01:12:00]  Well, Joan Rivers just went after Michael Jackson.  And I love her.  She's great.  I mean, she was pretty harsh.  If the boys could find the clip down the hall.  It was on one of those entertainment shows over the weekend.  Joan Rivers is a fucking monster on stage, man.  She's fucking hilarious.  Can we get her in here?  We tried, right?  She was here not too long ago, but she did outcube it.  She didn't want to get up early, I don't think.  I could try, though, because I know someone who's very, very close to her.  Is she a Howard gal?  Yeah, she is, but she doesn't give a fuck about radio stuff.  She'd probably still come in.  We'd love to have her on. 
[01:12:30]  Know what we replayed over the weekend was our interview with George Carlin?  Holy shit, was that good to listen to.  I don't remember that one.  It was a while ago, obviously.  We were all well engaged, man, just listening to every word he had to say.  I don't know what the protocol for this is, so I'm just going to do this.  Uh-oh.  Can I have my turkey, cheese, and a toasted bagel sandwich?  So it's here for the break.  That way I'm not eating during the show, so it's here for the break.  Thank you. 
[01:13:00]  I guess that's a good protocol.  Yeah, that's perfect.  Yeah, I'll just yell it out like that until we figure out a way where it's a little more subtle.  She's actually, um, Joan's doing this weird, because I know the roast was last week, and  people asked her, like, what is she doing this coming weekend?  Oh, did they?  Really?  What did she say?  She said that she wasn't working because she was flying to Middletown, New York, to see Jim Norton at the Manhattan Comedy Club. 
[01:13:30]  This Friday Saturday.  Feels good to laugh.  I heard the website was having problems.  Wait, Jimmy, for real, what's that plug?  Because you need people to go there to see you this coming weekend.  Manhattan Comedy Club.  I don't care.  I don't care.  This Friday, Saturday.  My jokes don't go over.  I don't care. 
[01:14:00]  8 and 10.30.  I don't care.  8, 4, 5.  He doesn't care.  3, 4, 6.  4, 2, 4, 2.  I don't care.  I don't care.  That would be this, uh, 400 Route 211 East, Middletown, New York.  I'm happy, go lucky.  This Friday, Saturday, it's a small comedy club.  I don't care.  My friend Rich Franchese, he owns it.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  Manhattan Comedy Club.  In Middletown.  It's not in Manhattan.  It's in Middletown, New York.  8 and 10.30.  Friday, Saturday.  I don't care.  I don't care.  8, 4, 5, 3, 4, 6, 4, 2, 4, 2. 
[01:14:30]  That's ha, ha.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  Yes, you can come this weekend.  I'm sick of my own voice at this point.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  Saturday, 8 and 10.30, Manhattan Comedy Club, Middletown, New York.  Boom, boom, boom.  Ding, ding, ding, boom, boom, boom.  See, it's our new bit.  You weren't here while we started.  That was a long one.  Yeah.  We like it.  I also watched a program over the weekend on Spike, which is ridiculous. 
[01:15:00]  There's so many shows trying to pawn themselves off as real things that are just fake, one  of which is that stupid repo show.  Don't try to even tell me that that's real.  It's a fake repo show?  It's fake.  That repo show is fake.  I think they might take some real situations and put bad actors in them, and you can tell  it's all fake.  Is it dramatization?  Yes.  Because the cameras are there.  No one's face is ever pixelated out. 
[01:15:30]  They're acting too shocked, and then there's drama, and there's always a confrontation.  It's absolutely fucking fake.  Absolutely fake.  I wonder if they offer to pay their actors or if they offer to pay the people's car off  if they allow them to do it.  Fuck no, because they're actors.  You could tell they're actors, because they're bad actors, too.  One of them actually went, Loey beans!  It was horrible. 
[01:16:00]  You weak, John!  So that's right.  John?  Ugh.  That sucks.  I just got such douche chills.  A show that's repoing cars, man.  That seems like it would be...  Yeah, you would think if you put a little time into it.  Why not?  It's just kind of a...  It would be pretty much cops.  Yeah.  Get the guy in the back seat with the cameras and then roll for it.  Yeah, roll and see what you come up with.  But no, everything's got to be this big...  It's almost like they're trying to do a Dog the Bounty Hunter with Repo, so they can't  pull it off, so they fake it.  And then this other show I was laughing at, and I couldn't turn it off, is A Thousand 
[01:16:30]  Ways to Die.  Great.  And it's like, these are actual deaths that have taken place.  And dude, it's urban legends.  Oh, really?  They're fucking urban...  But they're saying, like, these people actually died like this.  Like what?  You got one?  A couple of them I could see.  A woman swallowed a tapeworm to lose weight.  Oh, shut up.  Yeah, yeah.  You deserve to die.  But it didn't happen.  Okay.  The electrician that threw a power cord into the lake to kill the fish, and then he wound 
[01:17:00]  up touching the aluminum boat and getting electrocuted.  They're just all these, like...  What about the guy that was on a ladder, fell off the ladder, and then fell kind of backwards  until his ass landed in the doorknob?  Oh, wow.  Yeah, that happens.  Like how to do that guy.  All the time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yes.  There was another one where a guy, I guess he had put a thing of...  He wanted something up his ass. 
[01:17:30]  Oh.  So all he could find was some pepper spray, a pepper spray canister.  Right.  So he shoved it up his ass.  Yeah.  And then...  Well, you gotta.  I mean...  He had some kind of altercation with police, and when he hit the ground,  it went off inside of him.  Yeah, okay.  And they showed, like, the internal, what would happen inside if pepper spray went into  your intestine.  You think that would hurt?  And stuff.  Yeah, because he was just writhing in pain on the ground, and they didn't know what to  do.  Yeah, they just thought he was making a very, very bad fart.  Wow.  Cleared the room out. 
[01:18:00]  But it was...  They're fake.  Look at this guy.  A Thousand Ways to Die rules.  Why does it rule?  It was his paralyzing powder.  There was another guy that worked at a company that he would wheel in these pieces of furniture  that needed the paint baked on him.  You know, like metal furniture.  Thermite.  Things like that.  Thermite paint.  What a tool.  Always funny.  And he had narcolepsy.  So he went in there and fell asleep, and his buddy, and they show, like, the dramatization 
[01:18:30]  of it, just shut the door without looking inside.  He just shuts this big, giant door and turns the oven on and cooked his friend.  Holy shit.  And then another woman, that one right there, you see her face that Danny put up?  Yeah.  She was...  She had an emergency as she was diving and had to come up pretty fast, so they put her  in a decompression chamber so she wouldn't get the bends.  So it takes a long time, you know, to decompress.  And some worker at the place she was at opened up the decompression chamber, and she exploded. 
[01:19:00]  It's like, first of all, you wouldn't explode.  You'd get the bends where, you know, you get the nitrogen bubbles.  It's almost like opening up a soda bottle in your blood.  It starts bubbling in your blood, your nitrogen bubbles, and you can die that way.  But your head is not going to explode in the glass.  Like, right after that shot, they show her looking through a portal, and her head explodes.  Is it an actress reenacting, obviously?  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:19:30]  It's all reenactments.  I hate reenactments.  Another one was two, which was kind of funny, because all I could think of was Jimmy.  It was Aussie fans.  Two Aussie fans waiting to go to OzFest.  And they were like, these are the biggest Aussie fans ever.  And there were these two douchey guys sitting at a picnic table just going, Aussie!  Aussie!  Dude, look, Aussie burgers!  Like, they were just douchey being Aussie fans.  And then another guy goes, dude, look what I brought.  And he brought ants.  And it was like, dude, we could snort them like Aussie did. 
[01:20:00]  Nice.  So they snorted them, but they were fire ants.  And they went inside their nasal cavities and stung them.  And they swelled up and suffocated and died.  Why couldn't they breathe through their mouth?  That's what I was thinking until they said that their throat swelled up, too, because the ants went back there and stung their throat.  And they swelled up and died.  I said shut the fuck up.  It didn't happen.  Oh, that didn't?  No, no, I'm just saying.  They said it did, but I'm saying it didn't happen.  Are they using actual names of people? 
[01:20:30]  No, no, no.  Of course not.  The names have been changed to protect the dead.  All right, so this shit didn't happen.  Why protect them?  Exactly.  It's not protecting.  It's hard to look up these cases.  Dude, find the Ozzy one, because it is so bad.  Can we get clips from that for Jimmy?  It's so bad how phony into Ozzy these people are.  Oh, because they were acting out?  They're acting.  Oh, okay, okay.  They're just acting.  What is the paralyzing?  Is that succinylcholine?  That was a paralyzing thing.  Yeah.  You take that, and someone can feel everything, and they're aware, but they can't move. 
[01:21:00]  And they're aware.  Right.  Another guy ate change all the time, because you have this thing where you just eat change.  Sure.  And metal things, and his stomach ripped open, and he bled to death.  We got Andrew from Brooklyn.  He wants in on this.  Andrew.  Andrew.  Yo, y'all guys go to SpikeTV.com.  They got old videos from that TV show.  Really?  Yeah, they do.  Where?  Where?  SpikeTV.com.  I see it says play video. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah, we don't see any.  I see them all.  Do you see it, Ann?  I don't really.  Go to Spike.  Yeah, we don't see it, Andrew.  Let's see it, Andrew.  Can you help us find it?  We're looking, Andrew.  We're looking.  Hold on a minute.  We're looking.  SpikeTV.com.  We're looking for it.  No, I don't see it.  Andrew, you know when the space shuttle's coming back?  That's something to do with the topic.  Like, I'm just trying to, you know, just telling you where it is.  No, I know.  I just, do you know when the space shuttle's coming back from the station?  Thursday. 
[01:22:00]  Thursday.  Thursday.  It's coming back.  And which shuttle is it?  Endeavor.  That's it.  What?  Which one is it?  Endeavor.  That's it.  The what?  The what?  The Endeavor Space Shuttle.  That's it.  No.  Probably.  Special Endeavor.  He doesn't want to be that guy anymore.  I know, but I want him to be.  That's a lie.  He just wants to be a regular caller.  Point blank saying he's not falling for your crap.  So why, Andrew, you're calling up to support Mayor Stu Rasmussen? 
[01:22:30]  No.  Yeah, why do you like the tranny mayor?  That's really weird you'd call about that one.  I'm not talking about the tranny mayor.  Mayor.  The tranny mayor?  No.  Why?  What do you want?  Did you just get the audio of a thousand ways to die?  Yeah, we're looking for it now.  So hold on.  We're looking for it.  We just can't find it.  You're saying Stu Rasmussen is on that site?  No, just, I'm just saying that, you know, videos from that show, Spike TV's website. 
[01:23:00]  You like the tranny mayor, though?  Do you believe he should be in politics?  Oh, good question.  Like that, Andrew?  He's weird, and I wouldn't vote for him.  For who?  What about for governor?  No, I wouldn't vote for him.  What about for, what is he now?  You, y'all got it?  What is he now, what is he now, though?  What position is he now?  Oh, yeah, I forgot.  Is he governor? 
[01:23:30]  Yeah, he's just mayor.  Oh, okay.  All right.  I'll write that down.  Well, Andrew, I think we found it, so thank you, sir.  We appreciate it.  All right, see you.  All right, Andrew from Brooklyn, everyone.  Bye, sweetie.  Let's go to Paul in Jersey.  Paul.  Yeah.  You?  Hey, Paul.  I just want to let Ann know that that shitty Operation Repo show plays a little message  before it starts, saying that it's actors in traumatized situations.  All right, is it a message, or is it a disclaimer that's in print that goes by real fast? 
[01:24:00]  Disclaimer in print.  All right, see, that's just it.  No one reads the fucking disclaimer in print.  And they say it's not reality, it's actuality on the, that's their whole, like, slug line  for the channel.  You could thank lawyers for that one, too.  We can't really have, like, a show where you're repossessing cars.  Someone could get hurt.  Hey, Ann, have you ever seen that big steroided dude on the show?  He's actually got a website, like, trying to plug himself for other acting jobs and shit. 
[01:24:30]  Does he?  Yeah, that show's so fucking fake.  I watched it one day, and I'm like, all right, what's this about?  And then I knew instantly, I'm like, this can't really, this isn't really happening.  Someone is saying the show is really good because it's funny because the acting's so bad.  Yeah, the acting's horrible.  So it's worth watching just because the acting's so ridiculous.  Yeah.  Yeah, the acting is really, really bad.  Oh, Danny found it.  Thank you, sir.  Danny found it.  Which one is this, the ants?  That's the ants with the Ozzy thing. 
[01:25:00]  All right.  I just like how into Ozzy, fake, fakely into Ozzy they are.  All right.  This will disgust Jimmy.  This next story is a warning to all who worship false gods.  It can be extremely hazardous to your health.  What, watching this?  Taylor and Comrade's deity, Ozzy Osbourne.  Oz, man.  Ozzy.  To say they are Ozzy fans does a huge disservice to their complete obsession with the aging rocker. 
[01:25:30]  They live.  Ozzy.  They breathe.  They eat.  Ozzy.  Ozzy.  Because they're like baked, like Oz.  Yeah, dude.  Their commitment to Ozzy knows no bounds.  I love Oz so much.  I do Ozzy.  But not like in a gay way.  You know, it's just like, I would do them in a gay way.  Yeah, that's cool.  One, two, Ozzy. 
[01:26:00]  Today's the big day.  All right, wait, pause this.  Sotas.  Pause this.  Thank you, Jimmy.  They're opening Cokes.  They're shaking up their fucking Cokes.  They're at a picnic setting.  A lame picnic setting, by the way.  By the way, this is supposed to be the-  Tailgating or something?  Tailgating for OzFest.  What are you fucking kidding?  You know what?  They pick like someone's front yard.  I am so in with this show because of this clip.  Oh, I know.  Believe me, I couldn't stop watching it.  I thought it was just them in their backyard.  This is supposed to be at a concert. 
[01:26:30]  No, this is supposed to be at a concert.  And these fucking homos, first of all, they couldn't get the labeling, so neither one of  them is wearing an Ozzy shirt, and they couldn't get the right to Ozzy music, so they're  playing some shitty generic metal bed in the back.  Fucking assholes.  And then because, you know, they're getting ready for the Ozzy concert, it's time to drink  something.  Yeah, and they shake up soda.  Which obviously would be beers that you shake up and fuck around with.  But no, in this case, it's, what, Coke?  It's Coke.  They shake it up and they open and go, Oz!  Oz!  What's wrong with you?  Who does that? 
[01:27:00]  Nobody.  That's why I was watching this and going, this stinks.  Their commitment to Ozzy knows no bounds.  And I was just thinking, oh, Jimmy.  He doesn't act like this.  You unintentionally just turned me on to a great show.  Now you're going to watch this because it's so ridiculously bad.  And then you can see where the actors are improv and they probably just talk and they  try to be funny.  I do them not in a gay word.  That's the two guys improv and trying to be funny.  They're like, we'll leave that in.  That was good.  That was funny, yeah.  All right.  These guys are tools.  And Taylor has a special treat for his friend.  Yeah, guess what it is.  Guess what it is.  I know, I know, right? 
[01:27:30]  Oz Creed.  Rock and roll legend has it that Ozzy and Nikki Sixx once snorted a line of ants to show  just how hardcore they were.  It's ants, man.  Fire ants, man.  The decision to snort ants from all the things you could enact from Ozzy Osbourne, this probably  was not the best thing to go for to begin with.  It would be almost a punishment if there wasn't any social darwinism involved and if there  wasn't some kind of a consequence involved. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, dude.  Dude?  Nikki Sixx?  Yeah, and he's seeing all the ants.  Oh, dude.  Taylor and Conrad want to be hardcore, too.  Do you like this, Jimmy?  A couple of lines of fire ants should do the trick.  I'm going to take one.  I'm going to take one.  Oh, dude.  Dude, dude.  As soon as you snort up fire ants into your nose, the first thing you can do is bite.  Shut up.  Ow!  And immediately upon biting, they sting. 
[01:28:30]  They'll inject as much venom as they can.  They're very, very pissed off.  And rightly so.  God, what is this?  That will cause intense pain.  The head banging, lots of drooling, lots of screaming, wrenching of the eyes, trying  to clear the nose out.  And you're going to have very long fingers to get the ants out of your nose.  It's just not going to happen.  Then the swelling starts.  That'll start closing up the nose.  You can't breathe.  The trachea starts to close up.  Suffocation follows.  Now they show them just thriving in pain.  They're on the ground.  And the ants are still on the top of them. 
[01:29:00]  They're not crawling out.  Yeah.  Fucking idiot ants.  And now they're dead.  Stupid bastards.  A couple hundred fire ants won't necessarily kill you.  But if you inhale them into your nasal cavity and down your throat, you can't breathe.  You die.  A couple of big jerks.  Ozholes.  Ozholes.  Ozholes.  Stay.  Ozholes.  Well, the only reason I kept watching, see it says, watch what it says.  Ozholes. 
[01:29:30]  Now, after every single one, they put a little thing that had to do with how they died.  So the whole thing of me watching this was trying to guess what they were going to name  the little segment.  Like that was, one was butt plugged.  Yeah.  And that was the guy that shoved the fucking shit up his, the pepper spray.  Right, right, right, right, right, right.  You know what?  I'm surprised they didn't call us to host this show.  I know.  Doesn't this sound like something they would give us?  Die it.  Yeah.  Die it was the one with the woman with the tapeworm. 
[01:30:00]  I want to play the Ozzy fan.  Oz.  Ozburgers.  What the fuck is that?  I don't know.  No one talks like that.  No, they were so, yes, they do, Jimmy.  When you're that into Ozzy.  So you're just not as into Ozzy as you think you are.  Or you want other people to think you are.  They were true Ozzy fans.  Oz.  And then you shake your soda.  Let's go to Pete in Bayshore.  Pete.  Oh, try to find the one on there about the guy who was tripping out on acid in the desert. 
[01:30:30]  He wanders onto a bunch of people having sex, dressed up as animals.  And he sees one girl, jumps on her, turns out to be a real bear, eats him.  Oh, come on.  They're all urban legends.  Get the fuck out of here.  These deaths are all real.  I'm laughing my ass over there.  They said they're all real.  Get the fuck out of here.  It's so phony.  They're all urban legends.  Oh, that's classic.  Jesus.  It really is stupid, man.  You watch it.  I got to watch now.  I was watching and I'm texting. 
[01:31:00]  I think they're doing it tongue in cheek, obviously.  Right?  Well, I mean, looking at that.  It's very tongue in cheek the way they do it.  I think they got together like, all right, all these urban legends.  We could probably make a show out of this somehow.  But they're trying to present it like it's real, like almost faces to death.  Because then the last one of the day, I've noticed this.  The last one of each show is an actual thing where they show video of like, they show that plane crashing after the hijackers made the plane run out of gas.  Oh, in the ocean.  Yeah, in the ocean.  They show that and talk to one of the survivors of that crash. 
[01:31:30]  So like, it'll end with something real, which maybe that's how they get away with saying these deaths are real.  Right.  Not all of them.  Only the last one.  I know you brought this.  The Aussie fans hijacked their plane.  Flyers to Aussie.  Flyers to Oz plane.  Yeah.  The Oz zone lair.  I know you brought this to the show so we can beat it up, but I think I might become a fan of the show.  Dude, I wasn't saying it's not entertaining to watch. 
[01:32:00]  I was saying it's just bullshit.  It's so ridiculous.  I call bullshit.  When they got all excited about the big Aussie concert and they shook up their coax.  And they shook the coax up and all the foam went all over each other.  Couldn't they make it look sort of like a beer?  Why not just have a beer?  Oh my God.  That's crazy.  Because they might have been underage.  I don't know.  But they could show them dying?  That was a terrible show.  I was texting during that show and the text I was getting back was, why are you watching it then? 
[01:32:30]  I'm like, I can't change the channel.  We talk about that on the show all the time.  I can't stop watching this.  I watch it just to be completely pissed off.  Yeah.  Let's go to Rich in New Hampshire.  Rich.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up, little Jimmy?  All right.  I'm just going to one of the best shows on that repo show was they go to take this DeLorean from this kid.  And he breaks out into like a Michael Jackson dance.  It's the most staged thing I've ever seen.  Yeah, it's all fake.  Somebody sent me that video.  And that's what got me on trying to read the disclaimer and finding out it's fake is because somebody goes, 
[01:33:00]  And check this out.  It's funny.  And it's a video of a guy that's getting his DeLorean repoed.  And he starts moonwalking and stuff.  And punches one of the guys and they all get freaked out.  Oh, there's always punching and throwing things.  And then the big repo guys have to jump in.  And there's a lot of bad mouthing.  It's all fake.  Yeah, if you guys can watch that, it's hilarious.  I think you guys would like it.  All right, I'm punching out there.  See you later. 
[01:33:30]  Thank you, sir.  Is this one true, Ant?  Jamie in London, Ontario.  Hey, how you doing, boys?  Wait, is London, Ontario just over the border in Buffalo?  Just over the border by Port Huron.  Sarnia?  Yeah, that's where all the strip clubs are, right?  Lots of strip clubs, yeah.  With the Asians taking it all off.  They can take it all off.  It's great.  All right, sir.  It just brought back a memory when I saw London, Ontario.  I think I had to do gigs there and then drive back into the States drunk. 
[01:34:00]  All right.  When I was on radio in Buffalo.  For real.  It was the most nerve-wracking thing ever.  Yeah, U.S. Custom boys, they can be pretty scary, actually.  I used to cross the border to Detroit every night.  I think I told the story.  I was coming back from a gig.  I had to spin records at a horrendous bar somewhere in London, Ontario.  And then they had the stop on the way back into the country after you get over the border.  And I blew â€“ whatever the legal limit was, I missed it by â€“ I was under by â€“  Three border patrolmen? 
[01:34:30]  I missed it by 0.1 or whatever it would be, by just one.  And the guy goes, this is your night.  You are so lucky.  And I went, holy shit.  And I kind of learned a lesson that day.  Yeah.  I kind of learned â€“ that could have been a biggie.  Those systems guys are hardcore.  No shit.  Hey, a buddy of mine was telling me this morning â€“ I didn't see it, but he was watching that show last night.  And apparently a girl takes a carrot and cleans it up, shaves it off or whatever, and uses it to get off on herself.  And does all kinds of internal damage. 
[01:35:00]  Cuts herself up and bleeds out or bleeds to death or something to that effect.  You might want to look into it.  With a carrot.  Was that really on Spike TV?  That's pretty risque.  He was telling me it was on that 1,001 ways to die.  I didn't see it, but that's what he was just telling me this morning about it, actually.  Let's break this down a little bit.  You're a girl.  You want to get off with a carrot, right?  Why wouldn't you cut off the tip of those goddamn things?  Yeah.  You round it off.  Round it off.  Chop â€“ you know, just chop the tip off.  Look how fake this is.  You know what I think? 
[01:35:30]  This guy did a Michael Jackson dance and kicked one of the guys.  Sorry.  Oh, okay.  No, no.  Why wouldn't you just use a cucumber?  Wouldn't that be a lot easier?  I just got the douche chills because we're doing two things right now.  You're talking about the carrot with the 1,000 ways to die, and then we found the video  of the guy moonwalking or doing Michael Jackson moves when his car is being repossessed at  DeLorean, and it's ridiculous how stupid this looks.  Yeah.  Look, he starts dancing, and as he's doing Michael Jackson dance, he kicks one of the  guys.  This is good.  Yeah.  This is so real. 
[01:36:00]  All right, boys.  All right.  Thank you, Jamie.  Yeah.  Have a good day.  All right.  I kicked him in the ass.  Yeah.  It's so fake.  Terrible.  All right.  Wow.  A lot of people are watching this show, Ant.  I know.  Chris in Houston.  Chris.  Good evening.  Hey, Chris.  Funny every time.  I know.  What's up, Chris?  Yeah.  One of the deaths that I thought was hilarious, this guy was a raging alcoholic, had throat  surgery done, so he couldn't drink.  So he gets it, he's sitting there, the scene plays out, he's sitting there holding a warm 
[01:36:30]  bottle, an enema bag with a bottle of sherry, asking his wife to fill up the bag, shove the  enema up his ass and get him drunk that way.  Well, because the alcohol can't go through the liver, he dies of alcohol poisoning.  Ah.  See?  There was one with drinking last night, a biker, this biker guy, just some biker, robbed some  vague place.  It's all very vague. 
[01:37:00]  Sure.  And he was celebrating.  Good evening.  He was celebrating by drinking some whiskey by a campfire in the woods as he was on the  lam, you know?  Yeah.  And he got all mad because he dropped his whiskey and it broke.  So he's like, oh, and he can't go into town because, you know, they're looking for him.  So he decided, you know, why not drink a little gasoline?  That should give me a buzz.  So he siphoned some gas out of his motorcycle gas tank, added some Red Bull to it or something 
[01:37:30]  and started drinking it.  And now the science comes in where they interview some person that tells what happens if you  drink gasoline, that type of alcohol, which isn't the same alcohol that's in booze.  So he doubles over in pain and starts vomiting.  But now he's vomiting and he's got the campfire in front of him.  So he vomits in front of him in his fire.  The fire now goes back into the vomit.  It's all over him.  And he catches on fire and burns to death from drinking gasoline and vomiting in the 
[01:38:00]  campfire.  I heard about that guy.  He was a biker and he robbed the thing.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Jimmy knows.  Bango.  Movies and television, like they try to show gasoline as like it's so super combustible  that you could just don't even get a spark near gasoline or else shit's going to explode.  I've watched enough of Mythbusters where they tried throwing a lit cigarette into a puddle  of gasoline and it just does not happen like that.  It doesn't work.  The air mixture has to be just right.  It has to be kind of atomized almost.  Yeah. 
[01:38:30]  There's no way you're vomiting gasoline into a fire.  We all get paranoid when we're pumping gas though.  It's super hot.  I'm not taking any chances.  Superheated.  Atomized.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or direct flame.  And that's which is, you know, super.  And is this true?  Oh, Bill on Long Island.  Oh, Repo lets camera guy get in car.  They were towing and it flipped over.  See?  Ugh.  Oh, here we go.  Diane talking about the carrot thing.  Diane in Cleveland.  Hi.  Hi.  I am completely obsessed with this show. 
[01:39:00]  The guy that called in about the carrot.  Yeah.  I guess she didn't shave it good enough.  And like it tore the vaginal wall or something.  How did it?  And it got air into her veins and got to her heart.  Embolism, huh?  Yes.  Yeah, that's what they said.  That's so stupid.  I've never heard of a masturbation with a carrot fatality like that.  Stop.  Like if a girl can't stick a carrot in her.  I know.  I mean, really. 
[01:39:30]  And then I like the one where the guy, they were wood chipping.  And he got the thing stuck.  So he decided to climb on it and kick it through.  And it stuck in his leg.  Well, that one probably happens.  That's the first one I believe could happen.  Yeah.  I believe like something like that happens.  Sure.  Because people are stupid with machinery.  But, you know.  The narrator said if he's this stupid to try it, maybe he deserved to die.  Yeah, the narrator really doesn't give a shit about any of these people.  He just makes jokes about them. 
[01:40:00]  That's probably why people are watching.  That's the gimmick.  Phones are unbelievable right now.  That's the gimmick.  People are watching this show, Eric.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I saw that last night.  It was just like, oh my god.  Now I'm mad they didn't ask us to host this hit show for Spike TV.  No, it wasn't Mythbusters meets fucking Jackass.  Although it is kind of like Mythbusters meets Jackass.  Because they have the Jackass people doing stupid stuff.  And then they have the Mythbusters angle where they have the people that tell you the science as to how they died.  Right.  So, yeah, why the fuck weren't we us? 
[01:40:30]  And did they ever make Mythbusters meets Jackass the project they wanted us to host so badly?  There are a couple of shows like this.  Are they doing well?  Well, it...  Ah, shit, I can't hear it.  There's another one called Catch It.  Catch It or...  We turned down this show...  Catch It, Keep It.  Catch It, Keep It.  And how long did we...  For real, two to two and a half years they were courting us to do this dumb TV show.  Years ago.  Did anyone end up doing it?  It was ahead of our time.  But I wonder if it's the same production company that was trying to get us.  Quite doubt it.  I'll try to find the name of the show.  It's not on anymore, but I think they were using Mythbusters as a lead-in to it. 
[01:41:00]  And that's exactly what the show was.  I can't remember what it was called now.  It's not around anymore?  Nah, I think it was like one season and done.  See, we knew.  We knew how ridiculous this thing was.  Because then we started thinking,  the lawyers are going to get involved.  So even if this show has a chance, they're going to shut down.  Yeah, they'll fuck it all up.  Have the ideas we would want to do.  Exactly.  And then we're left doing lame shit.  Look what they let them do at Mythbusters, though.  They give them pretty leeway.  Don't forget the lawyers there probably aren't the same this year.  It's because it's all science.  And they actually talk, though, about what they have to go through certain times. 
[01:41:30]  When they blew up that fucking cement truck,  it probably was one of the best explosions I've ever seen on Mythbusters.  I saw that one.  They were trying to show how they could get...  One of the myths was that somebody threw a stick of dynamite in a cement mixer  to get the dried cement off the inside  because somebody fucked up and left it in there without it spinning.  So they threw a stick of dynamite in,  and they realized that can't happen.  But they wanted to know...  Then they always take it one step further and go,  let's just fill this fucking thing with dynamite. 
[01:42:00]  But they get...  Gotta make good TV.  FBI gets involved.  ATF gets involved.  They have government agencies that get involved with this.  They don't just go out on their own and get some fucking dynamite  and blow the fucking thing up.  And it helps that they're scientists.  It blew up this cement mixer to where there were just pieces,  little pieces of metal left.  That's amazing.  Hey, Dan, you still watch Mythbusters?  Sure.  I used to love that show, and then I kind of started tapping out.  Are they running out of ideas?  I don't think so. 
[01:42:30]  They kind of changed the premise of it a little  because it used to just be urban legends and myths like that.  So they kind of did this thing like now they'll do stuff  where they'll try out things that work in movies  and see if it really worked.  Movie myths.  I mean, those are still good episodes, too.  It's kind of not really a myth.  It's kind of a movie, so they over-dramatize certain things.  It still falls into the category, but it's not like an urban legend.  Have they done, like, cartoon shit?  All that ridiculous stuff they did in cartoons?  They have, actually. 
[01:43:00]  I remember one that I just saw recently was they wanted to see if you couldâ€”  I mean, obviously, you know, the old finger and the shotgun trick.  Yeah.  You know, see if you could plug up the barrel.  That's funny.  But, I mean, obviously, they knew it was going to do significant damage to a finger,  but could you actually get the barrel of a gun to peel back, like, banana style?  Yeah.  You know, and then that becomes the myth of the show.  They did get a split in one of the barrels.  It's so interesting to see, you know, the ways that they go about achieving those results.  And they're just really funny guys.  They're so odd together that it's pretty funny. 
[01:43:30]  I like when they come in.  We haven't had them on in, God, probably a year now.  And that stupid Mike Rowe, who's a friend of the show.  Where have you been, Mike?  He's everywhere, apparently.  With these national TV commercials.  You forgot about your pals, Opie and Anthony?  He's voicing everything.  Yeah.  Maybe we should treat him nicer next time he's in here.  Yeah, I know.  We usually beat him up.  I have to go to the bathroom.  What, Jimmy?  What?  I've been holding him for 25 minutes.  I have to pee.  All right.  I'll see you, sir.  Yeah, I can't wait.  You're wearing an Aussie shirt.  Piss for Aussie.  Are you going to the Aussie room? 
[01:44:00]  We're taking an Aussie piss.  Yeah, I gotta go take a Posse.  Work duty in there somehow.  I was trying.  I didn't have one.  Smug your own piss.  Aussie would do it.  Yeah!  Get my water!  Extreme!  Yeah!  Justin in Wyoming.  Justin.  Justin.  Wyoming?  Justin.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  He just laughs.  Everyone knows he laughs.  What do you want? 
[01:44:30]  Justin, tell me one thing.  Hold on.  Before you get into what you want to say, tell me one thing about Wyoming that the average  person wouldn't know.  We all don't fuck sheep.  All right.  There you go.  Why are you calling the show today?  Hey, did you guys hear about the one where the girl was out fishing?  She snagged a fish, came back, and got it in her throat.  She suffocated it out of the whole deal.  The fish went into her throat?  How did that happen?  I just caught it, and I guess her mouth was open. 
[01:45:00]  Oh, she pulled it in the boat, and it got her?  It just went in her throat, I guess.  All right.  Good description.  Thank you.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  Jesus Christ.  Well, we can move back to the subject another day.  It's like, that's a guy that can't tell a story, though.  It happens.  Like, tell...  How did it happen?  So, she's reeling in a fish, and it jumps, and it goes in her mouth, and they show, like,  how it...  Like, some details.  Oh, the cartoon thing is being done.  Man versus cartoon. 
[01:45:30]  Thanks.  This has come in a few times.  True TV on Sunday.  Brandon from Tennessee and others tell me about man versus cartoon.  Actuality.  A guy likes being shocked during sex and hooked a car battery up to his nipples and electrocuted  himself.  That was on that show.  That's a tough one.  One of the Thousand Ways to Die was about a short-necked guy in a Saturn trying to pick  up trannies.  No, that's...  No.  A guy hooks a cow heart to a car battery and fucks it? 
[01:46:00]  Get the fuck out of it.  Was that really on the show?  No way.  Jason, are you fucking around?  Nah, man.  It's called...  That little name at the end of it is called Heart On.  Heart On.  Oh, so they did not put heart on at the end of that, did they?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, he hooked it up to a car battery first, and I guess it's not enough juice for him  or something, so then he plugs it into, like, the 110 outlet on the wall and shots him.  Kills him right there. 
[01:46:30]  Wow.  You know what?  Okay, here we go.  Repo.  The Repo Show.  Not worth watching.  This Thousand Ways to Die.  Now I gotta watch.  Yeah.  When is it on?  Boy, I have no idea.  I guess last night.  Yeah, Sunday nights.  All right, I'm gonna DVR that shit.  At some point, nine-ish, ten-ish.  I'll be on board, because look, everyone, they're just calling it out.  I know.  A Thousand Ways to Die.  And Greg Brady's leftovers.  Mike Rowe, best guest ever, no question about it.  Yeah.  What about Bobby Lee?  Bobby Lee was strong the last couple of days.  He was strong in a different way, though. 
[01:47:00]  Great guest to have on, but because he is fucking out of his mind.  And I had a lot of people asking if that whole thing is real.  I don't know.  Like, he has panic attacks, and I'm like, why are you panicking over the most mundane shit  that we do on this radio show?  But he's also a funny and kind of crazy sketch actor, too.  Yeah.  Right.  So he's not, Bobby knows how to do characters.  Yeah, exactly.  You don't know.  I'm not sure.  I've worked with him.  I know him in L.A.  He's a very sweet guy.  I don't know what he's like, though.  It could be realistic.  He is kind of a nutty, weird dude. 
[01:47:30]  I can't figure him out.  I do know this.  We need him back on the show, and he said he's not coming back until next year now.  He'll only do the show, like, once a year.  Once a year when he forgets.  And he completely panics.  I ran down the hall with a flip, and I videotaped him.  Before he came on the show, he was having panic attacks.  I'm like, why are you having panic attacks?  And I still didn't get the answer, really, even though the video was pretty good.  And then he came in.  Just freaks him out to do the show.  He looked at Stalker Patty's gaping asshole.  A lot of people think that the video that's up right now on the YouTube channel is actually him looking at Bobo. 
[01:48:00]  No, no.  No, that was the day before.  We got Stalker Patty naked, and then she spread her cheeks for Bobby Lee.  He took a look, said there was moisture in there, and he couldn't handle it anymore.  And then he had to leave the studio.  And, of course, someone was holding the door so he couldn't get out.  And he was really freaking out.  And then when he finally got out, he just sprinted down the hall, and that was it.  Some people go, well, all right, then you went to break or something and talked to him.  No, he ran out of the building.  We have not talked to him since.  And we really want him back on the show.  So if you could show Bobby Lee some love through his email or whatever the fuck, however you could get him. 
[01:48:30]  Huh?  Twitter or whatever.  Twitter?  I don't know.  Why don't we take a break?  Yeah, that way I could eat.  Yeah, let's do some eating.  When we get back, Andy Rooney is hurting.  He's hurting.  Corey Feldman's still hurting.  Andy Rooney is now hurting as well because his good friend.  Walter Cronkite died.  And Blanket's still scared of the dark.  Scared of the light.  He's in the dark all the time. 
[01:49:00]  You're on board with Blanket, right?  Enough with Blanket and all these dumb kids.  Overrated kids.  Fucking Van Damme's children.  They're not even his.  Fucking stupid white kids.  I hate white kids.  Andy Rooney, before Jimmy leaves today.  Yes.  I save this for you, Jimmy.  Andy Rooney sounds off about fruit.  What is it about fruit?  I'm sure he's got a big problem with it.  It's not like the old days.  I bought mine off a cart.  A man in the street. 
[01:49:30]  Craig, I used to go need it at five points and watch people fight.  Opie and Anthony stay there.  Looks like they finally let Jim Rice into the Hall of Fame.  Wow.  They've been debating Jim Rice for, I don't know, decades, right?  He hasn't played in, I would guess, almost 20 years.  How many home runs did he have?  I don't know.  He was one of those guys that his stats were kind of on the fence, and they didn't know  what to do with Jim Rice.  But I guess they didn't have anyone better this year, so they said, all right, let's let 
[01:50:00]  Rice in there, or it's going to be a very lonely stage for Ricky Henderson.  I don't know if Rice belongs in there, to be honest.  Did he not have 500 home runs?  Not even close, right, Travis?  He had 3-something?  He had 3-82.  Yeah, he shouldn't have been in the Hall of Fame.  This was his last year of eligibility, so I think they just kind of gave it to him.  You have 15 years after you...  What was his lifetime batting average?  298.  298?  I don't think he belonged there, but...  Yeah, he didn't, actually.  That's not a bunch of Hall of Fame stats.  Did he have injuries?  No.  That's not Hall of Fame stats.  No, absolutely not.  But they let him in with Ricky Henderson. 
[01:50:30]  And you know Ricky still wants to play, I'm sure.  I'm sure he's still making a lot of phone calls.  Ricky absolutely belongs there.  Yeah, of course.  And then Terrell Owens thinks the NFL should reinstate Michael Vick immediately.  And I completely agree.  Yeah, I agree, too.  Yeah, absolutely.  He did his time.  I don't need any...  I don't give a crap what the athletes are doing.  I don't care if they're doing the steroids.  I don't care if they're committing crimes.  As long as they give me a good game.  That's all I care about.  He went to jail, that's it.  Yeah, once you do your time... 
[01:51:00]  And he did do his time.  Yeah, once you go to jail, man, you fucking...  Come on.  You get those animal activists, though.  They go crazy, man.  They don't want him.  They don't want him fucking working ever again.  They want him just...  Well, what is he supposed to do?  Exactly.  Yeah.  Like, if you did your time, shouldn't that be good enough?  Yeah.  They have deemed that whatever you had to do, you've done.  Now you're out and...  I wasn't a big fan of the dog thing, to be honest with you, but...  No, no.  I think the guy should be able to, you know, get back in the NFL.  Yeah.  And whatever team signs him, holy shit, that team's going to be pumped up. 
[01:51:30]  But they're saying he'll never play quarterback again?  Why is that?  Well, you know, that's the team leader.  Oh, is that the...  I would think that, you know, they don't want him to be the centerpiece guy, at least at this point.  Travis, what are they saying about him?  That he would play another position?  I haven't read anything about that, but if he were to play another position, it would probably be either running back or wide receiver.  Sure, right, right, right.  He was very versatile.  So, that's a biggie with T.O.  How does he say his name? 
[01:52:00]  Terrell.  Not Terrell.  He said Terrell.  It's Terrell.  Yeah, and he had to correct us.  Terrell.  Stop it.  Because he's wearing sunglasses.  He was a douche on our show.  Yes, he was.  It's easy to say that now that he's not here, and I'll acknowledge that.  He was every athlete.  He was almost...  Except for the MMA guys, he was every athlete that we've interviewed.  Did we ever have a cool athlete in?  Now that you said that, Jimmy?  Well, when David Wells came in on N.E.W. a few years ago, he was cool.  He was pretty fucking cool.  David Cohn was pretty cool.  I didn't have David Cohn.  I wasn't here for him.  That was N.E.W.  Terrell was fucking Terrell.  Joe Frazier was cool. 
[01:52:30]  Frazier was great.  I didn't consider boxers.  Yeah, Frazier was great.  Floyd Mayweather was okay.  He was late and cocky and, like, boring.  You know what?  Oscar De La Hoya was nice.  Yeah, he was all right.  He was nice.  He was a very nice guy.  He was not a dick.  And who knew he was a bad boy?  Oh, I did.  You knew before then?  Oh, long before.  Well, I told you, I used to date someone who allegedly used to hang out with him.  Good evening.  But, yeah, most of them have been... 
[01:53:00]  What about Jim Lairitz?  Yeah, Lairitz was okay in studio.  Yeah, I guess I'm wrong.  No, he was really good in studio, and then he kind of blew us off after the fact, and  he didn't even remember being on our show.  That's always fun for us, when we have this, like, chemistry on our show with somebody, and  we're not expecting to be invited to, you know, to their Vegas fucking trips and shit,  but we do expect maybe a high.  And this guy looked at us like, who are you guys?  I'm like, are you kidding me?  We had, like, we shared some shit for, like, an hour and a half on the show. 
[01:53:30]  You don't remember?  And then his life went bad after that interview.  Wow, did it go bad.  Yeah.  Oh, Pete Rose.  Who was yelling and screaming that Pete Rose needs to be in the Hall of Fame?  Was it Hank Aaron?  Hank Aaron said he knows what he did.  Down syndrome children all over.  I don't think Hank Aaron's going to support Pete Rose now.  No, what?  There was an article today.  I didn't get to it yet.  What are they saying about Pete Rose?  I thought it was Hank Aaron where a bunch of people are now getting together saying,  you know, Pete Rose really deserves to be in the Hall of Fame, 
[01:54:00]  especially with all the bullshit that's been going on in the last few years.  Yeah.  Well, I know Hank Aaron said that Pete Rose's situation is different because everybody knew that rule.  So, you know, he knew that he was breaking the rule.  It's not a vague rule.  It's not a vague rule.  Oh, yeah.  That's true.  What constitutes?  Oh, like, you're doing steroids.  You know you're doing something wrong, though.  Come on.  But it wasn't wrong for a while.  For a while in baseball.  That wasn't wrong to do steroids.  Just one said shit about it.  And then, yeah.  Pete Rose is betting on fucking games. 
[01:54:30]  This moral and ethics shit in sports has just got to go away.  Gambling is a big one, though, especially when you're a player manager.  Betting on your own team to win because that may affect your decision making.  If you have money on the game, you may bring in a relief pitcher who needs to be rested for the week,  but you've got to win that game.  You've got to win that game.  You've got to win that game.  Of course it's going to affect your decision.  You may leave your starter in past the sixth inning because he's doing well,  even though you know his shoulder's a little tender.  Yeah.  Right.  You're not looking at the big...  Yeah, it could affect you.  And wrapping up our sports break, some dude won the Tour de France. 
[01:55:00]  So congrats to that dude.  Cool.  And to let you know who it wasn't, the winner, two testicles.  Two balls.  A two-balled winner.  A two-balled winner.  That's nice.  Two-balled winner.  That's very rare.  Yes.  What, did Lance come in third?  Third.  They have some weird thing there where, like, I don't know, he had to, like, not try to win anymore or something  because that was his teammate.  And I...  I don't know.  I thought he was retired. 
[01:55:30]  He came back.  And Jimmy's got breaking news about Affliction?  Well, yeah, it was over the weekend it broke.  Affliction apparently is done, which was the company that Fedor was with and who had him contracted for one more fight.  And then I think he was supposed to fight Josh Barnett this week, and then Barnett tested positive for steroids.  Oops.  And that is the end of that fight.  And they had no one to replace him with.  And I think they just folded.  So it looks like...  I don't know what his contract will say, but I think he's free and clear.  Hopefully.  And hopefully Dana can go after him.  I would love to see him in the UFC. 
[01:56:00]  If Dana wanted to get Fedor, like we were saying during the break, like, tell Brock Lesnar to just get a lot of rest,  blow off every fight they were thinking of having with Brock Lesnar, and get that fight signed.  It'll be...  Can you imagine how big a Brock Lesnar fucking Fedor fight would be?  Fedor fight.  It'll be very big.  Fedor's still on top of his game, obviously.  Brock Lesnar is right there.  Who isn't watching that?  Because it's at least two fights.  Who do you think wins that one?  It's hard to...  I think Fedor does.  It's at least two fights.  You're right.  Best of three, basically. 
[01:56:30]  Because Fedor is so...  Lesnar's a fucking animal, though.  He really is.  But the thing is that Fedor is a submissions expert.  It's like...  I mean, I know Frank Muir was too, though.  But he's not on the level of Fedor.  And Fedor has beaten animals.  He's beaten fucking animals.  And Kevin Randleman is a fucking animal.  He's a big, big dude.  And he was a wrestler.  And he suplexed Fedor on his head.  Fedor still tapped him.  So this affliction thing happened over the weekend.  So any day now, we would probably know the fate of Fedor. 
[01:57:00]  It might be the end of last week, actually.  Or at least Dana would go, look, I'm making a run.  Something will come out in the next day or two, I'm sure.  I guarantee they're talking.  But Fedor's a tremendous wrestler.  Someone's saying Fedor will never be in the UFC.  Why not?  Where else would he go?  Here's what they're going to say.  All right, let's get him on the phone.  They're going to say he won't be in the UFC because he won't sign Dana's contract.  Because Dana won't let him fight a Sambo wrestling.  I think it's called Sambo.  And stuff like that.  But Dana's not a fucking idiot.  He's not an idiot.  He knows that Fedor could go overseas and just fight for the rest of his life. 
[01:57:30]  He wants to sign Fedor.  He's not an idiot.  Sean, what do you got on that?  Okay, Jimmy.  Fedor's manager, Vadim Finkelstein, is a Russian guy.  He's got a company called M1 Global.  Fedor is also promoted through M1 Global.  M1 will only allow Fedor to fight if the promotion that he fights with co-promotes with M1 Global.  He said that will be the only way is if it's co-promoted. 
[01:58:00]  And Fedor has been with him forever.  Fedor is never going to leave him.  And the UFC has no reason to co-promote with another company like that that puts on their own fights for the outrageous amount of money that's going to be taken.  Sean, but money talks in the end.  You've got to think the money would be so ridiculous that they would figure something out.  The UFC will get â€“ as big as Fedor is, he's not that well-known to the casual MMA people.  So you know about him because you've talked about him because you've had Jimmy and Bobby to tell you about him. 
[01:58:30]  Wow, Mars, who watches every UFC thing possible, says you're way wrong.  Here comes Mars, who â€“ I've got to tell you, he really needs to be on our show a lot more.  This guy is amazing.  Yeah, I think you're wrong about people not knowing Fedor, sir.  They know the name because they just â€“  If he was so big, then why was Affliction getting horrible â€“ or not that good of pay-per-view numbers?  I'll tell you.  Kind of one guy.  Because you have one guy.  You know, after Fedor, I couldn't name another guy.  Yeah, and plus Affliction, I just don't think that you had the machine that UFC is. 
[01:59:00]  I think that Affliction didn't have the promotional fucking genius that UFC does.  And Fedor, again, this is the thing that Fedor and Don King said this.  He doesn't have a great personality.  Like he's a nice guy, but he doesn't have like this amazing come-watch-me-fight personality.  He's just this quiet machine who beats the shit out of people.  So hold on, dude.  I think if promoted right, like with the UFC behind promoting and putting him against Lesnar,  I think that that could be the biggest fight they've ever had by far. 
[01:59:30]  And they're saying there's a press conference on July 31st.  Fedor will just keep talking.  Fedor will fight for the UFC.  Bank on it.  That's what Brian said.  Yeah, dude.  I think you're wrong, bro.  We'll see what happens.  Until that co-promotion gets worked out.  Look, Affliction just fucking went under.  What do you think M1 wants to do?  Have Fedor not fighting the biggest fights he can fight?  There's so many people in the UFC.  I mean, there's not a lot of heavyweights, but I mean, there's enough guys.  There's Brock.  There's a couple of others.  I mean, look, if you had to fight Frank Mir, there's enough big names in the UFC where  Fedor has probably at least fucking three or four fights guaranteed that are big, big 
[02:00:00]  moneymakers.  I've gone into backyard UFC-ing.  I say they figure it out.  He's got to.  What, dude?  What?  It's not just a deal with Fedor.  I understand that.  We understand what you're saying, but we're thinking that they'll figure something out.  How do you know UFC doesn't bend just to get Fedor?  Because there's only one Fedor.  There's only one guy who is seen as almost unbeatable.  He's lost one fight.  He shouldn't even have lost that fight.  It was on a fucking...  It was...  The other guy should have been disqualified for head-butting him, and it was just because  of an open cut in the first round. 
[02:00:30]  That's all it was.  He never lost a fight.  And also, Dana White has a lot of leverage in this situation right now.  What, sir?  I mean, MMA is on its way up big time.  You're right.  And this guy doesn't even have a league to fight in right now.  What, sir?  Yeah.  He has plenty of leverage right now.  The UFC is the biggest in the United States.  Yes.  Dream is not getting that good of numbers in Japan.  You didn't...  Strikeforce, which is coming up, which they're also...  Which M1 Global is talking to now about getting Fedor on.  Didn't Crow Cop go back with Dana?  Like, he left... 
[02:01:00]  He did a fight, and then he fucking went with Dream, and then he's back in the UFC now.  Yeah.  So, I mean, Dana obviously just pulled him out of Dream.  Yeah.  So why can't he keep Fedor from going there?  If it's not getting great numbers, everyone knows the U.S. and the UFC, it's got to...  It's the biggest one, and it's continuing to grow.  Dana's going to take over everything.  Yeah.  All right.  Listen, Sean, we've got to move on, because we're going to lose Jimmy, and I want to get  some Andy Rooney on the air for everybody.  Look, if we're wrong, call back.  I don't think we're going to be wrong.  We'll see what happens.  It's going to be a pretty interesting few days.  If we have a right callback. 
[02:01:30]  That's right.  So we could browbeat you.  Mars, you were terrific on the air again.  Good job.  I've got to tell you.  Just amazing.  Amazing stuff for me.  Mars was on the air?  Yeah.  I would be rooting for that fucking Russian, too.  Send me that tape.  Mars, in 10 seconds, what do you got on this?  Yes.  All right, Mars.  We have.  We understand.  That's definitely...  Right.  Exactly.  It's definitely going to happen.  Definitely going to happen.  Definitely.  Federer is going to fight in the UFC.  Why you say definitely?  Because that's the way to go.  I mean, Brock Lesnar and Federer, come on. 
[02:02:00]  All right.  I thought you had to sign a phone.  None.  That's the way to go.  It's going to pick that up.  It's going to be super.  Really?  That's a brief part break if I...  Yeah.  Mars says it would be super.  Right.  Go pick up your screwdriver.  Fall on it.  So, Andy Rooney is hurting.  Aw.  He...  Did he talk about Cronkite?  He was a mess at the memorial for Walter Cronkite.  He couldn't even finish.  We don't have that audio right now.  We don't have the audio for that?  We should have it.  It was quick.  We need that.  He goes, I'm sorry.  I just can't.  I can't. 
[02:02:30]  I'm sorry.  You ever cry in the middle of talking?  Yeah.  Why doesn't he do a little something on that?  On crying.  Crying at memorials.  That's way more interesting than this fruit thing he was doing recently.  Yeah.  I think the Cronkite thing was, I don't know, late last week, Friday maybe.  Can we get that now?  Yeah.  The boys, if they can find it real fast.  Maybe it's on YouTube then.  Andy Rooney...  That's what I'm going to say about fruit.  You want to hear about it, fruit?  I like this Steve Carlesi.  Well, Andy Rooney, he's tackling all the tough subjects. 
[02:03:00]  Of course, fruit.  With his commentary.  From the time we're very young, someone...  I can't even listen.  Yeah, he's got to start, you know.  Yeah, from the time we're very young, there are covered wagons going west.  Right.  Fossil.  From the time we're very young, someone is always telling us to eat more fruit.  Well, I think we would eat more fruit if we knew for sure that it was going to be any  good when we bought it.  So expensive.  We went to a good store in New York called Fairway the other day and looked at their fruit.  The Fairway. 
[02:03:30]  Better than they used to be.  When I was a kid, my mother would cut them in two and sprinkle sugar on them and leave  them overnight.  How'd you like to have the job of stacking fruit in a fruit store?  I like that more than anything in this segment.  It didn't fall down.  Holy shit.  How would you like a job of stacking fruit?  And what was the fruit he was talking about there?  I don't know.  He probably just held it up.  He'd cut it in half and put sugar on it?  I'm guessing grapefruit.  Then the Indians would come and arrows would fly into it.  I'd call one of the slaves to come up and put sugar on my fruit. 
[02:04:00]  I'd say, Kizzy, stop spitting in my beverage.  Never notice a slave cuts fruit rather slowly when it's hot.  Miles Standish came over.  He likes bananas on his cornflakes.  How fucking old are you?  After a hard day at the Salem witch trials, we'd enjoy a little bit of fruit.  Because I'm old, get it? 
[02:04:30]  My testicles look like two walnuts and a turkey neck.  I know that's not fruit, but I didn't think quick enough.  Boo.  No, that's not a boo, my friend.  Walter Cronkite, who I love, is turning into the color of a banana right now inside a coffin.  He's rotting, much like fruit would do.  Look how long it takes before his jaw falls.  It looks like he's singing opera. 
[02:05:00]  Before eternity.  Eternity just singing opera.  Holding a note for eternity.  Thousand years later.  Long hair.  Do you ever notice how easy it is to talk about fruit and how hard it is to say goodbye to an old friend?  Poor Andy.  You know what?  We can't continue with this. 
[02:05:30]  Let's do a little bit more, man.  A little bit more.  I've got to hear what he says about fruit.  Andy Mooney sounds about fruit.  The fairway.  Yeah, yeah.  And this is a national show he's on, right?  Oh, it certainly is.  It gets paid very well, right?  We're here at the local fairway where all the employees look like Somalia pilots.  Or pirates.  Yes.  No, I meant they look like pilots.  They're very bad television shows that don't make it.  All of a sudden, I'm Asian.  I was so in with you.  Man, this is our supermarket, eh?  Yeah.  The fairway is in our neighborhood.  And he's right.  Somalian pirates work there. 
[02:06:00]  All of them.  Oh, wow, do they.  Thin as a pin, are they?  All of them.  It's scary just to walk by that supermarket.  Yeah, and the cash register guy at 10, and he eats it.  He doesn't know.  He thinks it's food.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ah, shit.  We should have Sam, like, follow these, uh, Andy Rooney reports and do his own.  He should go talk about fruit at fairway.  Fruit?  Uh, Andy complains about various fruits that he sees. 
[02:06:30]  Lemons.  One of the great fruits.  So versatile.  So many things you can do.  You might have seen a photo of me and my friends having a lemon party.  We all like lemons.  Which one were you, Andy?  I was the one on the bottom.  Lucky devil, that's what they call me.  Getting a kiss and my dick sucked.  You ever notice after you eat the ass of an 80-year-old man, only lemons will take that flavor out of your mouth?  You ever notice how hard it is to get the sweat of an older man out of your mouth?  Now, Andy, you were part of the lemon party.  Like, who are the other two guys? 
[02:07:00]  We're still trying to figure out who the other...  Morley Safer.  Morley, okay.  Ed Bradley.  Ed Bradley.  We had to Photoshop that so the interracial police wouldn't call us.  We didn't need the Aryans beating us up.  Ed Bradley liked to kiss me while Morley Safer sucked my penis.  Steve Croft is more of an ass fucker.  What about Leslie Stahl?  Leslie Stahl likes to sit on a fist made of plastic.  That's why she's so uncomfortable in her seat. 
[02:07:30]  Holy shit.  Andy's a little racy with this lemon.  At the company party, Leslie got up on her hands and knees and fired a fist out of her vagina.  We all laughed.  Landed on Les' rug.  Imagine stacking sex toys.  Lemons.  One of the grapefruits.  So versatile.  So many things you can do with them.  What can you do?  What's great about lemons?  Here's what you do with lemons.  You make lemonade. 
[02:08:00]  All right.  Or you squeeze it in a drink.  And you put it in a Corona.  It has something to do with, like, a beverage.  Oh, no.  Not even in a Corona.  That's why.  It's a garnish.  What the fuck?  You're not taking lemons and eating them.  Oh, lemons.  You're not just eating them.  Lemons suck.  You ever notice when you put two lemons under your shirt, you look like a 12-year-old girl?  You ever have a 12-year-old boy over?  You'd rather have a 12-year-old girl?  So you make him put lemons under his shirt.  You ever notice that?  Looks like little buds.  Of course you can't eat them.  They're mango. 
[02:08:30]  They're good, but...  You ever notice when you get out of the boat in Vietnam to get a mango and a fucking tiger attack you?  Never get out of the fucking boat.  Do you ever throw a mango at Lance after you kill a whole big bunch of people for a small dog?  Do you ever yell, have a mango, too?  Do you ever do that before your head gets cut off and thrown into the lap of Martin Sheen when he's sobering up?  Holy shit. 
[02:09:00]  Holy shit is right.  Eat them.  They're mango.  They're good, but the pit is strange shape and very hard to get out.  You need a sharp knife and it takes about half an hour to get out what you want to eat.  You ever try to shit a mango pit and you wind up pulling the towel rack off the wall?  Fucking Jimmy.  Jimmy Rooney, everyone. 
[02:09:30]  I'm trying to pass one of those and bleeding from the eyes.  Oh, my God.  Knife and it takes about half an hour to get out what you want to eat.  I'm not too familiar with a papaya.  Buy one, but I don't know whether I know what to do with it, whether to eat it for breakfast or dessert.  I suppose over the years, I've wasted more money on melons than anything else I've ever bought.  I bought a thousand honeydew melons and only three of them were ripe over the years. 
[02:10:00]  You ever notice when a segment is dying, you just try to laugh at all the ironies of it, and it doesn't save it?  How many fruit laughs can I have?  I laughed over not knowing what to do with papaya.  I laughed over all the bad melons I've bought.  I laughed over how worthless lemons are.  I really should have died in 1985.  Why are you buying all the melons, Andy?  I don't know.  I just needed something to talk about.  And I don't know what a papaya is good for.  I know Ed Bradley had one growing on his neck. 
[02:10:30]  A thousand honeydew melons and only three of them were ripe over the years.  I don't want to buy six or eight bananas.  I got them in a pack.  I just want one or two bananas.  All right.  You can get that done, Andy.  Relax.  Yeah.  Go to a deli.  They sell them individually, especially bananas.  How the hell do the f***s find good melons?  They seem to always have good ones.  Don't get me started on the bananas. 
[02:11:00]  One more clip from Andy Russell.  Talking about fruit, everyone, on a national show.  Amazing.  I don't like green fruit.  Green is for vegetables.  We used to climb the mountain and pick these when I was a kid.  Jesus Christ.  Mountain's not there anymore.  It's eroded away.  It's now the Grand Canyon.  I'm old.  I'd pick fruit and eat Diane Fossey's ass as poachers cut the hands off her furry friends. 
[02:11:30]  That's right.  Me and the mountain gorillas.  They'd throw shit at me and I'd laugh.  You know Diane Fossey had a dick?  Did you know that?  Did you ever notice when you're fucking a naturist with a dick and poachers kill her,  you feel sad?  Did you ever climb out the window while African poachers are cutting your girlfriend's throat  in the mountains?  Did you ever do that?  Did you ever pet something and the next day its hands and feet are gone?  And you just feel sad? 
[02:12:00]  Did you ever bond with something that becomes an ashtray on someone's coffee table?  Did you ever go to your co-worker's house and say,  Hey Steve, where'd you get that ashtray?  But we didn't call them blueberries.  We called them huckleberries.  Strawberries.  They're all from California these days.  I mean, if you're in New York,  the strawberries should have been grown in New York or New Jersey.  I think a cherry is the only thing I've ever stolen from a store.  One of the great mysteries to me is how they make a grape without any seeds in it. 
[02:12:30]  And where's the next generation of grapes coming from if they don't have seeds in them?  What do they have tomatoes in with their fruits for?  I know there are people that argue that tomatoes are a fruit.  Tomatoes are a vegetable.  I don't care what they say.  I hate to have a sticker on a piece of fruit.  The three of us here in the office had a contest the other day  to see how many fruits we could name.  I think Susie won with 27.  See how you do.  No, that's okay.  Oh, wow.  We won't be playing that one around the office today. 
[02:13:00]  I won the biggest wasted segment.  I won.  Hands down, they said.  They were counting how many fruits they know.  How many?  You know what?  Guaranteed, Andy was like,  Hey, could you come in here a minute?  Yeah.  How many fruits could you name?  And then they have to walk down the hall and make believe they gave a shit.  Like, oh, fuck.  Yeah, like, oh, God, here it is.  What are they going to fire this old codger?  They run past Andy Rooney's fucking...  Are they frying watermelon?  I think so.  I got to go, boys. 
[02:13:30]  Are you kidding?  That's a great hour.  That's great.  Here's the clip of, it's 40 seconds of Andy Rooney choking up at Walter Cronkite's memorial.  We'd each go to a base that we liked, and we'd write our stories, and then we'd go back to the headquarters of the Air Force, and they had it set up so that we could write and send our stories from there.  And that's when I got to know Walter Cronkite.  I got to know him well. 
[02:14:00]  You get to know someone pretty well in a war.  He named 19 fruits.  I just feel so terrible about Walter's death that I can hardly say anything.  He was so young.  He's been such a good friend over the years.  Please excuse me.  Thank you.  That would be a good place for a fart noise.  Yeah.  Right?  During the silence before he goes, please excuse me.  Put a fart in there.  Do we have a fart sound effect?  Yeah, we got to have a fart. 
[02:14:30]  Hold on.  Work in progress.  Yeah.  Work in progress.  Jimmy, awesome.  What a way to lead the show today.  I'm so bummed I'm going to miss fucking Michael Emerson.  I'm screaming.  I'm going to miss Michael Emerson on Wednesday.  I'm so depressed about fucking Ben from Lost coming in.  I'm going to miss him.  And Dice.  Yeah, well, Andrew, I know.  I mean, I can just call Andrew.  I love Andrew, but I, you know.  We don't see you until Friday now, Jimmy.  Yeah, I'll probably call in once.  Big movie star.  Yeah, call in.  Yeah, we'll see how it's going.  If you can.  I'll try to get somebody in because I'll be up there with Patrice.  Yeah, call in if you can. 
[02:15:00]  All right, guys.  We understand.  I'll never find anything.  I'll talk to you in a couple days.  All right.  Bye, Jimmy.  Bye, guys.  There goes Jimmy.  Bye, Jimmy.  Bye, sweetie.  Bye.  Do we have it?  I suck.  I can never find sounds I need.  We could just make.  Never notice.  We could just make a fart sound.  Yeah, I can make a fart sound.  All right.  Really?  Yeah.  All right, hold on.  Now I got to get it all over.  I got to figure out what he says before the silence.  Hold on a minute.  Somewhere in here, I think.  I just feel so terrible about Walter's death that I can hardly say anything. 
[02:15:30]  He's been such a good friend over the years.  Please excuse me.  Thank you.  Wait, can you do that?  Hold on.  Look at us working on a bit.  Hold on a minute.  I got one more thing to add after that.  Hold on.  I might have to give up on the Denon's finally. 
[02:16:00]  Okay.  Okay.  I just, I just feel so terrible about Walter's death that I can hardly say anything.  He's been such a good friend over the years.  Please excuse me.  That's a fucking asshole.  Children. 
[02:16:30]  Absolutely.  Fucking children.  Danny, one for you.  There's someone saying, please tell me you saw the picture of Larry King on what would tylerdurton do.com.  Thank you, by the way, to the listeners trying to get him on our show, but he's too scared to come on our show.  He's a huge fan of our show, but just doesn't want to blow it by fucking up on our show.  But supposedly there's a picture of Larry King playing softball in the big celebrity game they have every year in Hollywood.  And there's a picture of him batting that I guess is ridiculous. 
[02:17:00]  Oh, it's not up there, though?  Maybe they have the wrong site?  All right.  We'll figure it out during the break.  Opie and Anthony, when we get backstage with ONA, Bobby Lee escapes.  Escapes.  That's pretty much what it was, an escape.  Absolutely.  And then we got some other things.  Things.  We'll figure it out during the break.  Doyle rocks.  We need some paying gigs is what we need.  Get the fuck out.  Get out, Randy.  You tuning son of a bitch. 
[02:17:30]  Morris.  Fucking genius.  I'm going to watch Sling Blade.  Always.  I'm a little out of this conversation.  Oh, there.  It's been a while.  But the thing is, you've got to watch it ten times.  Because all they want to do is just practice and have a band and play some gigs.  Yeah.  And that's all they want to do.  But Doyle, they want to practice.  He throws his beer through the window and he calls him a tuning son of a bitch.  You motherfucker.  You tuning son of a bitch.  You tuning son of a bitch. 
[02:18:00]  All right.  Speaking of movies.  Someone help me out.  I wanted to go to the movies this weekend.  For real.  I was a bit sick.  For real.  I had like a dumb 24-hour bug.  So I was kind of close to home all weekend.  And I need to be out.  Out and about doing shit.  And I went to my local theater and I have no desire to see any of these movies.  And then I went on my, I was saying this, I went on my On Demand.  And there's nothing there I want to see.  Or I've seen it.  You don't want to demand anything.  No, absolutely not. 
[02:18:30]  So what is out at the movies?  Because to tell you the truth, I don't even keep track of that shit anymore.  When was the last time you were at a theater?  Oh, my God.  Don't remember.  Probably for some screening we did here.  Really?  Yeah.  I saw 500 Days of Summer.  Good movie.  Not, oh my God, but it was good.  And the theater was completely packed.  Had to figure out, I had to sit too close to the screen.  And I'm like, in this day and age, we don't need to do this.  Give me my fucking movie right in my house. 
[02:19:00]  That's how I like it.  That's what I watch.  And there's a market there, isn't there?  Of course there is.  How much money, we got to go with the average person, but how much would you spend to see  like a movie that's in theaters right in your house?  $1,000.  Well, I'm teasing, of course.  But you would think they couldn't go less than $100 or something like that is what I'm  thinking.  That's crazy, though.  I know, but I'm sure they do the math and go, well, if we offer these movies for $20,  $25, they're just going to bring everyone to that house and we're going to lose all that 
[02:19:30]  money.  So I think they got to make the cost a bit high on the high side.  But once again, you go to the theater and your home system's better.  Yeah.  And I'm talking to the majority right now.  We all make sure we have some kind of system at home, right?  Yeah.  The sound is good.  You don't have fucking assholes in the theater with you.  You're not looking at a grainy copy of some fucking movie where the speakers aren't working  in the theater properly or it's blasting loud or it's too low. 
[02:20:00]  Car chases are fucking blasting.  Dialogue, you can't hear.  I fucking hate that.  You know what drives me nuts about going to a theater?  It's really simple.  The fucking exit signs that are lit up because dummies can't figure out how to get out of  a theater if there's a fire.  If there's a fire, yeah.  You just trample everybody.  It's lit up so much that it takes your eyes away from the screen at times.  It's in your peripheral vision.  Remember when we were growing up, because I know that's a newer thing too. 
[02:20:30]  When we were growing up, man, you went into a theater.  It was pitch dark.  Yeah.  And if you were late for the movie, you would pretty much sit on someone's lap.  Stick your ass in someone's face.  Yeah.  You didn't know.  No.  But now those exit signs are so lit up.  It takes me out sometimes.  Yeah.  Because it used to be cool to be in a really dark theater checking out a really cool film.  I can't do that anymore because there's too much riffraff going on, I guess.  No.  It's because of the...  Lawsuits.  It's because of the people that can't figure out how to exit. 
[02:21:00]  Where the exit is.  Who exits in the front of the theater anyway?  That's for fire.  Somebody else's fire in a crowded theater.  Yeah.  They'll still run the way they came in.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's human nature.  Remember, your closest exit may be behind you.  There you go.  That's an airplane bingo.  So, weekend box office.  Ice Age.  Dawn of the Dinosaurs.  Now, I would see this, but not in a theater because animations are way better at home.  On demand or if you get the DVD.  Way better at home.  It's not even a question.  I saw that up. 
[02:21:30]  It looked horrendous on the screen.  And then someone told me I should have went and saw the 3D version.  Yeah, everything's in 3D.  Everything's in 3D now.  Because they figured out the 3D thing, finally.  Yeah, well, they figured it out at Disney quite a while ago.  True.  I remember going to, like, Disney World and seeing some, you know, Bugs Life.  Right.  Stuff like that.  The Muppets in 3D.  And then we had to wait, what, 10 years for it to be everywhere.  Captain EO was one of the first ones with Michael Jackson 3D.  Was that good?  For the time, I think it was cutting edge. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  But now.  And they're going to.  Are they coming out?  Hold on.  Let me go to Jersey here.  Who's this in Jersey?  Jersey.  Hey, it's Keith in Jersey.  The Mac consultant.  Hey, what's up, Keith?  There's an article in the news over the weekend that James Cameron and Spielberg, a short list of the ultra-high ticket directors, are getting behind this ultra-high 3D theatrical format to drive people back into the theaters. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah.  The other thing is, you guys have to see the new trailer for Tron Legacy.  It rocks.  Tron Legacy.  Yeah.  Comes out next year in IMAX 3D.  But Tron was so awful, why would they attempt to, you know, put.  Because it's got modern-day graphics.  Okay.  There you go.  And the same way they did X-Men, where they made Patrick Stewart, the other guy, look a lot younger to do the flashbacks.  Yeah.  Right.  Doing the same thing with Jeff Bridges.  All right.  There you go.  Interesting.  We'll check it out.  What about that new James Cameron movie? 
[02:23:00]  They showed a little bit of it at the, that fucking geek con.  Comic-Con or whatever it's called?  Yeah.  They showed like 14 minutes of it.  I don't know if they showed that much of it.  What's the movie about?  What's it called?  Avatar.  Oh, Avatar.  Right.  Sure.  I was going to say Avalon.  That's what it used to be.  But that's got quite the buzz, doesn't it?  He's been working on that for 10 years or something.  How long does it take this guy to make a movie?  I know, like 10 years the guy's been working on that.  Well, if you're him, though, you could do that.  Is this the new Tron? 
[02:23:30]  Oh, that looks kind of cool.  Those are the light cycles.  Boy, did they completely change that around.  That kind of looks cool, the light cycles.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  All right.  But why have a light cycle?  What's the point of a light cycle?  You've got to cut the guy off so he has nowhere to go with your little light walls.  Yeah, remember, the whole purpose of the movie was that it was a fight inside the computer.  Inside the game, right.  Right. 
[02:24:00]  Right.  Yeah, I wasn't in with this Tron thing.  I couldn't be bothered.  No, I couldn't.  But this looks kind of cool.  We're looking at it right now.  Thank you, sir.  You're going to see the last 10 seconds of the trailer.  That's where it is.  Last 10 seconds?  We're, like, not even close.  Yeah, come on.  We've got the long trailer.  Get out of here, Henry.  It goes on for, like, five minutes.  No, no.  It's only like a two-minute teaser trailer.  There's a payoff there, guys.  Watch it.  A payoff.  All right.  Hopefully nudity.  Punch it out.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Are we going to wait for the payoff? 
[02:24:30]  Are we getting close?  I mean, this is the end of it.  This is the end coming up now?  It's the end, so.  Whatever he's talking about.  Oh, wow.  There's the payoff.  What is he talking about?  All right.  Neon Tron?  Who cares?  Ice Age, Dawn of the Dinosaur.  And then in fourth place was the movie that got so much hype, and it didn't do that well.  Orphan.  Oh, Orphan, yeah.  What did we learn about Orphan?  I need to know.  I think Sam.  Was it Sam that saw Orphan?  Could Sam give it away, and people turn off their radio for like 30 seconds?  There's nothing to give away.  She's fucking a weird kid, and she probably killed her parents or something. 
[02:25:00]  Let me figure this out.  We might be giving away the ending of Orphan, so you might want to check in in about a minute.  Yeah.  All right.  Turn the volume down, but just look at your radio.  See, at least we're being nice about this.  We used to just spoil it.  Yeah.  Sam, was Orphan good?  I liked it.  Aw.  Why did you like Orphan?  Why are you looking at me like that?  I thought it was good.  You like Orphan?  I like horror movies, though.  It had a twist.  Horror movies.  Horror.  Of course it had a twist.  Can you write down the twist? 
[02:25:30]  The twist is that she's not just an orphan.  Twist is she's a man?  She killed.  What?  Yeah.  I don't even want to give it away.  Wow.  That really blew it.  Dude, how does that happen?  What?  Well, if I start, I could write it down.  Write it down.  Yeah, write it down.  Keep writing.  For real, I don't feel like giving away the spoiler.  I just decided.  That's so stupid. 
[02:26:00]  But now I'm mad because I never would have thought of that.  But why would that be?  I never thought that.  But why is...  Get out of here.  Shut the fuck up.  Come on.  Is that true?  Yeah, that's true.  You're making jokes now.  This is an SNL skit.  That's funny.  Yeah.  Is there anything else to write?  Sam is writing the spoiler to the orphan.  Now, what's...  So what's the problem?  It's better that we're not giving it away.  Like...  Yeah, what is her problem? 
[02:26:30]  Uh...  Really?  Yeah.  What?  Did they show that without them?  Yeah.  Supposedly.  Once the twist comes in.  Once the big twist.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, look at that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now, um...  Were you like...  Why?  Was it like Sixth Sense?  Like, wow!  Who saw this?  I saw...  I kind of knew it was...  Okay, now wait a minute.  Why?  All right, but what is her problem, though?  Why?  Yeah, why is this?  Yeah, write that down.  Write it down.  Write it down.  Right.  What is her...  Right! 
[02:27:00]  What is her malfunction?  What is her problem?  What's the premise to this?  That why is this happening?  And if she is what you wrote down,  then why is she...  And then because...  And then...  You know what I mean?  Just let me see.  All right.  What?  What?  But what is...  So it just comes down to, like, being...  Why is she causing all these problems, though?  Yeah, yeah.  There's got to be a reason for it.  She's just...  No?  Is there something in the past?  She's done things in the past. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah, okay.  What?  Similar...  Nah, write it down.  Let me see.  That's crazy.  You know what?  I'm kind of mad, too.  Now I'm mad.  Now I would have been like, oh, fuck.  Let's make a pact.  We're not giving away the spoiler today.  No, no, no.  I'm not giving away at all.  We've decided we're not giving it away.  It's better that Sam writes this shit down.  And people are screaming, tell us.  No, no.  No, let someone else tell you.  Because we lose too much audience when we fucking do this. 
[02:28:00]  That's not a bad twist.  That's a pretty good twist.  Now I'm pissed off.  Oh, okay.  All right.  In the past, you did that.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  I got to write.  I got to write something.  Here, here, here.  Talking about orphan.  Hold on.  We're not talking.  No.  I know.  It didn't make a lot of money, though, Sam.  It didn't have good reviews.  Write it down.  Write it down.  Write it down.  Yeah, it did have good reviews. 
[02:28:30]  Wait, what did you write?  Okay.  Show Opie.  Okay.  All right.  Now write it down.  Get out of here.  Get the fuck out of here.  Really?  Yeah.  Okay.  He's writing more.  What do we do with this?  Do we bring this to everybody else?  No.  No?  No, we can't flow this because this is good.  This is Peter.  It's actually good.  I'm bummed.  Peter Puffer from Rochester. 
[02:29:00]  My new favorite bit.  Write it down, Sam.  You got a new bit, Sam.  Write it down, Sam.  Tell Sam.  I'm so bummed now that I know.  Yeah, same here.  We were stupid.  But I thought it was going to be the normal hack thing where, all right, here it is.  She's not this innocent kid and she killed her prior family and things like that or something.  You guys are never going to see this in the theater.  It'll be 14 months before it's out on cable or whatever.  You're never going to remember this day.  Ever.  No.  I'll know this.  I just don't want to blow it for people out there. 
[02:29:30]  That's all.  You know how many movies I've watched where I know the ending's been blown, but I could  watch it anyway because I don't remember.  Yeah, but you'll know.  Once you start watching this, you'll be like, oh, yeah.  When did you figure it out?  Oh, nuh-uh.  Let me see.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  That's fucked up.  Well, because the preview said Esther's got a secret.  Yes.  So I was trying to think of what her secret might be.  And that's what I thought it could be.  Well, I kind of knew that.  I kind of knew that one.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Of course.  Let me write.  Come on, those pieces of shit, Ed. 
[02:30:00]  They're so pissed off.  Everyone's mad.  I like the little twist we did on the spoiling a movie bit.  No other radio shows are doing this right now.  Huh?  No other radio shows are doing this.  Blue Heeler, do you guys think you're retaining listeners with what you're doing right now?  I don't give a shit.  At least the music's good.  Okay, here.  Wait.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Let me see.  Was that explained?  If what you said.  No, this is not a secret.  She's got an accent. 
[02:30:30]  You can't tell in the trailers.  Yeah?  She's got an accent.  Okay.  Oh, okay.  That's not a big spoiler.  Sorry.  So she just.  Well, fuck me running.  Yeah.  She's got an accent.  Oh, wait.  Danny's writing.  Danny's writing.  All right.  Does she have.  Does she.  Wait.  Oh, that's a good one.  Yeah.  All right.  Was that addressed?  God, Danny.  You know, that comes out with a great fucking.  Look, I'm not saying it's wrong.  That is a good.  People are screaming.  Yell it out.  He's got an answer, though.  Really? 
[02:31:00]  They're all screaming.  Tell us.  Uh-huh.  This is our new bid called Write It Down, Sam.  Write It Down, Sam.  And it's for your benefit, people.  Let me explain something to you.  This is for your benefit.  Let me see.  Yeah.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  You know what I'm saying.  Oh, right, right, right.  Oh, hence that.  Oh.  All right.  All right.  Now I understand.  Now I got a question.  Everything.  Right, right.  Hold on, I got a question.  All right.  Okay. 
[02:31:30]  Do-do-do.  Sorry.  This is just making me laugh.  I hope he's writing, writing.  I might get a chuckle out of here.  Oh, yeah.  No.  No?  Why?  You see.  Write it down.  Write it down.  What are you kidding?  Let's say you see and then gets you ready to say something.  I'm going to write it down.  Write it down. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, oh, he's putting the mic near his sharpie.  Well, if you're doing write it down, Sam, you need the microphone near the sharpie to  hear the writing.  I like write it down, Sam, so much better than real Sam.  Yeah.  I love the music Travis picked, too.  Yeah, this is good.  This whole bit's coming together.  This is write it down.  I love it.  Oh, really?  The start, but not the...  Oh, well.  Is there...  Is it hot?  There's one scene I should write it down.  Write it down.  Write it down.  Write it down, especially something that might be a little... 
[02:32:30]  Just keep pushing the slug line.  Write it down, Sam.  Oh.  I got one, too.  Can we have a production piece for Write It Down, Sam?  Yes.  Not immediately.  Oh.  Derek's going to be mad.  He's going to have to do a production piece for Write It Down, Sam.  Oh, there's a lot of writing on this one.  Whoa! 
[02:33:00]  Let me see.  Stop!  Wait, I can't see.  Yeah, okay.  That's the question I had.  Damn, yo!  We got a match.  We got a match.  I was about to fucking...  We got a match, Sam.  We all had it.  Oh, nice.  We all had it.  Wow.  We all have a match.  Write it down, Sam.  Yeah, write it down, Sam.  Write it down, Sam.  Write it down, Sam.  It's going to be a hit on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Yeah.  I'll have to carry my Sharpie with me everywhere I go.  I wrote down Howard Stern, but that was for the mayor bit we were doing earlier. 
[02:33:30]  Sorry.  Wow, okay.  You know what?  Fuck, I got to see this goddamn movie now.  It's pretty good.  I'm bumming.  I'm bumming now that Write It Down, Sam wrote it down.  Yeah, yeah, now it sounds, yeah, this is okay.  There's some pretty fucked up shit in the movie.  Yeah, apparently.  You wrote everything down and ruined it for me.  People are screaming.  They're livid.  You fucking tell us.  Livid pissed.  And then someone wrote, this is like listening to an internet chat. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah.  Anything else, Sam?  It's very angry.  Yeah.  Oh, he's writing down one more thing.  Wait, what are you doing writing without the microphone right next to the Sharpie?  I want to include everybody.  Here, I'll turn up your mic.  Squeak.  Here it is.  Do you think anyone can tell what he's writing by hearing the Sharpie?  I don't know.  I'm a little worried.  It's like reading lips, only reading Sharpie.  The old phone number bit where you could, you know, tone.  Beep, boop.  All right.  Oh, excuse.  All right. 
[02:34:30]  All right.  Oh, oh.  All right.  It's very disturbing themes.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Well, that's probably why they wanted her in the first place.  Correct.  Probably the reason they looked past her foibles.  Correct.  Foibles.  Well, I'm going to have to see that, I think.  This one's a spoiler, and it would, if I said it out loud, it would spoil.  No, then write it down.  Write it down.  Write it down, Sam.  Write it down, Sam.  You got to say write it down, Sam, because the pit's name is write it down, Sam. 
[02:35:00]  Don't say it.  Write it down, Sam.  If Derek doesn't have a write it down, Sam production piece by tomorrow, he's fired.  I hate write it down, Sam.  If I was a listener, I would hate write it down, Sam.  Footer wants in badly, but hold on.  Before you show that, Footer is talking for the entire audience, Anthony.  Footer.  Hey, boys.  Check it out.  I got something real good for the show.  Okay.  Okay.  Huh?  What do you think?  See, he's writing down, Footer. 
[02:35:30]  What are you doing, huh?  See, he's writing down his phone call, Ant.  I gotcha.  That's right.  That's how it is to listen, is you fucking knucklehead.  One more.  Is this the last one?  I guess so.  Oh, oh.  I think it's nice.  Not so nice, though.  What?  And no one notices that until...  Yeah.  Right, right, right.  Right.  It's like, you can't just get that stuff anyway.  Yeah, really?  Well, obviously.  Well, terrific.  You know what?  I was ready to give away this movie, but I want to see it now. 
[02:36:00]  I got to write something down.  I don't care.  I just got to write one thing down.  I got to ask him.  I got to ask him one more thing.  One more thing?  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  One more thing for writing down, Sam.  I wonder if we're going to get people to see this movie now because they want to know  what we were writing.  Maybe next week they could all guess what we wrote down.  By the way...  Wait, what did you write?  Jesus.  What the fuck? 
[02:36:30]  No?  Yes?  No?  Yes or no?  All right.  No?  All right.  Of course not.  Jesus.  What the fuck's wrong with you?  I hate writing down.  I guess no one saw the movie over the weekend.  Not one person had instant feedback.  Not one is in.  I know.  They're all mad.  Jess was not happy about seeing it.  No?  Why?  Is it really scary?  Yeah, just a creepolo movie.  Creepy?  Really?  She doesn't like that stuff.  Why not?  She's just not into it.  You're a creep. 
[02:37:00]  Why?  She seems to like you.  Yeah, she likes me.  She is so cute.  Thank you.  My God, is she cute.  Adorable.  We had a really good time Saturday night.  What?  I was doing a show.  Yeah, I know.  Oh, no.  I mean, we had a really good time.  We were listening.  She doesn't come to the show when you do the show, like a night out?  Well, I mean, this time she said she was hanging out with Opie's wife.  Oh!  I thought, and you were sick, I thought.  What can I tell you? 
[02:37:30]  You're gullible.  Although there was a text message sent while I was doing my show.  I did send a text message while he was doing the Sam and Dave show, a special delivery  ant.  I invited Opie to come on the show, and instead he texted me that he would not be coming on  the show, but he needed to share another bottle of wine with my girlfriend, who he  called his side piece.  Side piece.  What's that middle one?  Huh?  That's my favorite picture of her.  Oh, I know you like that one.  Look at this one.  God damn, that's hot.  With the big eyes, the hair, the pouty lips. 
[02:38:00]  With the big eyes, like that painting.  Like the animals.  Like the little, like the sad puppies.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, and her hair looks all nice.  And I got a little cleavage.  Very little.  You can barely.  The hair's covering up a lot of it, but that makes it sexy.  And she's looking right at, that's the kind of picture that I said I like to jerk off  to, remember?  She's looking at you.  She's looking at me.  Yes.  That's good.  Could you just email me that picture?  No.  Thanks.  And here's my exact text.  So they're doing the Sam and Dave show, special delivery, and they did a very good 
[02:38:30]  show.  Oh, it's great.  That's Greg Hughes talking.  Oh, wow.  I wrote this to Sam because Sam, Bobo called.  Oh, great.  And Sam admitted he was going to do an opie, and he hung up on me.  He goes, well, that's opie's bit, but I had to.  Something like that.  Sure.  So then I write to Sam.  I go, it's okay.  You just did my bit.  Me and Side Piece thought it was hilarious.  Oh.  I got to go get her some more wine.  Loving the show.  Toodles.  Which was just, I mean.  Getting her all boozed up.  I didn't understand.  Getting her all loosened up at the house.  I was trying to focus on doing an entertaining program. 
[02:39:00]  And you got to do a show.  How slow was time going for that, huh?  It was very slow.  I had a tick tock.  And this was the beginning of, this was like the first hour, so.  Sam, because people are wondering, I got a new bit called.  Write it down, Ope.  Oh.  Oh, damn.  I'm going to write down what I did to your girlfriend.  What?  Wait.  What?  What does that say?  Look at you.  What does that say, Danny?  I didn't write it down, Danny.  I beat you.  I hate this.  Me and Danny are on the same page today. 
[02:39:30]  We're talking about movies.  Oh, okay.  Let's get back to movies.  Movies, yes.  Any more questions about Orphan?  No, I think you pretty much blew it for me, Anne, and Danny.  I got a movie question.  Yeah.  Okay.  Did you tape it, Ope?  Tape one?  Oh, Jesus.  Okay, I see that note, Danny.  I see that.  You didn't hide that one well.  I'm just asking the same question.  Okay, I've seen that note.  Sam, write it down.  And the answer would be the same as what you wrote.  Oh, geez.  I wrote.  Is it?  You wrote, no.  Yeah.  Is it?  Is it?  That's none of your, I mean, I'm not even going to bring it up. 
[02:40:00]  Oh, that's none of my business?  That's none of your business.  Aw.  All right, listen.  All right.  So Orphan turns out to be okay.  Is that the movie or is that your relationship?  Danny is picking up notes from the movie.  Oh, we're going to show them.  This is write it down Sam notes about the movie Orphan.  Oh, it's not about your girlfriend or anything.  Okay.  All right, listen.  Oh.  So Orphan did not good.  $12.7 million.  That thing is going to be leaving the theater. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah, but you know, how much could it possibly have been?  Maybe it's a little word of mouth and it does okay.  How much could it have cost to make, to tell you the truth?  It's no name actors, right?  Peter Sarsgaard.  Sarsgaard.  There's no CGI or anything really.  No.  Right?  Yeah.  So how expensive could it have been?  I mean, please.  They'll make it all in DVDs.  In third place over the weekend, The Ugly Truth.  My girl actually saw this and this is why my girl rules.  I didn't have to go.  She didn't even ask me to go. 
[02:41:00]  Oh, my God.  She went and it was like a girl's thing and she said it was horrendous.  I told you from the poster.  That was the poster bit we did Friday, right?  Yes.  The poster bit.  Same movie?  Who's in that?  She said it was horrific how bad it was.  Katherine Heigl and that guy from-  Oh, the Heigl movie.  Okay.  Yeah.  That other guy.  From-  From-  300?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, someone sent me a picture that said, look at how awful this looks.  The typical back-to-back white background sucks. 
[02:41:30]  And I clicked on it and it was one of our publicity shots with us almost back-to-back with a stark white background.  Apparently we had that as a publicity shot.  Oh, I just have one more note for-  Yeah, it was almost it.  I think it's from that, right?  Yeah, yeah.  I think it's that one.  I have another note for Write Down Sam.  Oh.  We'll play it backwards, though.  This is the answer. 
[02:42:00]  White.  Oh, my God.  It was this.  It was this.  It was this.  I don't understand what that means.  I'm sorry, but I have to say-  It was this.  You just said it right out loud.  I have to say-  It was this.  Why would you write that?  I don't even understand what the question-  It says grape jelly.  Let's just say it.  It was this.  I think it's asking you.  This is the answer.  Oh, that's the answer.  Yeah.  I don't understand.  This is the answer, in case you wanted to.  Oh, because you were writing it right down.  So, what flavor?  Is it syrup or grape jelly?  What?  And it's grape jelly.  What do you mean? 
[02:42:30]  What?  I don't understand.  The other night when you were doing a show.  You know.  I didn't have toast.  Well, I did.  I don't know.  At all.  What?  I just don't understand why everybody's laughing.  So, the ugly truth sucks a dick.  And then, I have no problem admitting this.  I want to-  I would see Harry Potter.  Well, there are a lot of people that-  But it's-  They got darker.  Put up on it.  They got darker.  Yeah?  I would go see Harry Potter. 
[02:43:00]  And then, number one at the box office was this G-Force.  Yeah.  Is that the hamsters?  Yeah.  That looks horrific.  It's 3D.  Is it cool, though?  Someone see it out there?  Isn't Tracy Morgan a voice in that?  Zach Galifianakis is in it.  What?  I swear.  Zach.  Galifianakis.  Nice.  Does everyone just make, like, boatloads of money on those animated things?  Oh, hell yeah.  Or is it just-  Dan, I told you you should have been in that business years ago.  You didn't listen to me, though.  You should be doing the voices for some of these movies, Dan. 
[02:43:30]  I know.  What's wrong with me?  In my basement.  All right.  Crazy person.  Moving on.  Sam is actually in here because you did a backstage with O&A.  Bobby Lee escapes.  Well, yeah.  I mean, we couldn't just let him go away without some closure.  So, I filmed him before the show panicking in our office.  Correct.  OB Radio and YouTube.  And then he came in, saw Patty's naked ass.  Asshole.  Asshole, because she spread her cheeks.  Yes.  Asshole!  He saw moisture.  Anyone else get the feeling that not only is Bobby recovering from alcohol and pills, but maybe a sex thing? 
[02:44:00]  I don't know.  That entered my brain.  I'd stay out of that.  Because when he said yes, I've never heard a yes delivered better than when Bobby Lee, we asked him, do you want to see?  Yeah, he was trying to leave.  And then he said, wait, do you want to see our asshole?  And he said, yes.  Yes, I do.  Yes, I do.  Yes, I do.  Yes.  He had to.  He sat right back down.  Yes.  Oh, by the way, I edited one of Anthony's video to my channel, too. 
[02:44:30]  Oh, thank you.  It's in my favorites.  Yeah.  Yeah, wow.  And it's not even, I don't know how we're allowed to talk about it, but it does a thing.  What am I yapping about?  And he was talking about Michael Jackson being black or white, and you were showing examples, and the video's really good.  Someone captured it and sent it to me, and it's about a minute, and it's on my YouTube channel under my favorites, if you want to check that out.  Very, very good.  Forgot about that.  Nice.  So, Bobby Lee.  Bobby Lee.  So, after the show, you ran out of here with a microphone to try to capture what the fuck was going on with him, right? 
[02:45:00]  Yes, I just started following him around.  Like, he was leaving.  Like, he ran out of the studio and went straight for the elevator and left.  But, I followed him.  And now, backstage with ONA, here is Primetime Sam Roberts.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and comedian Bobby Lee stopped by the Opie and Anthony show  and had a panic attack after looking at Stalker Patty's butthole live in the studio. 
[02:45:30]  As Bobby tried to escape the building, we shoved a mic in his face.  Bobby, you're leaving already.  You know what?  We got to stop.  Oh, God damn.  I didn't mean to stop.  No, yeah.  I don't mean to stop.  We got to stop.  That is...  She...  All right.  I got it figured out.  She should be a mayor in a small town somewhere.  She looks like she's going through a sex change to become a woman.  That looks like a man...  We're looking at a picture of Stalker Patty that was taken at very close range. 
[02:46:00]  Let me play Stalker Patty.  Oh, stop.  It should have been a shot taken at close range.  Yeah.  But it's a picture, and it's from right below her breasts to the top of her head.  Yeah.  It could not look more awful.  She is horrendous looking in this.  With her fucking tits.  Dude, if you didn't know any better, like, cover up the...  Well, the breasts even look like...  Kind of like fatty man boobs.  Yeah, they're... 
[02:46:30]  Like, cover that up.  You would say that's a guy.  Yeah.  With maybe a little makeup on.  Yeah.  Looks like a tranny.  Wow.  Toof.  Maybe you could pixelate that and put it up somewhere.  People can see.  Just gotta pixelate the nipselate.  I have others if you want.  I mean, I got from the back, from the front.  Yeah, Danny was going around like it was a fucking photo shoot.  I looked at Danny at one point going, you're a sick fuck.  He reaches his iPhone, like, around a corner. 
[02:47:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Because Patty was bending over, I guess, for Bobby Lee.  Yeah, there he is.  Oh, fuck.  Reaches his iPhone and goes, click.  It was the no-look iPhone shot.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Obviously, I couldn't see the screen, so I just reached over.  Hey, you're pretty good at that.  It looks like you've done that before, Dan.  You got that big gray bush.  Danny's done that a few times.  All right, backstage with O&A, Bobby Lee escapes.  We're looking at Stalker Patty's butthole live in the studio.  As Bobby tried to escape the building, we shoved a mic in his face. 
[02:47:30]  Bobby, you're leaving already.  What happened?  No, it's just...  It's nothing.  What do you mean nothing?  You will not have to go.  That's what happened.  Why?  What do you have to do?  Well, because I don't like any of it, but I'm just trying to pretend that I like it  because I want to be cool, you know?  Yeah, and then...  But then it's like the reality sinks in, and it's not cool, you know?  So you don't feel like you're one of the cool kids?  No, I am one of the cool kids, but it's just like, you know, it's like deception, man.  What about Stalker Patty?  I don't know.  I don't know any about that.  I've never heard of it.  I don't know anything about that. 
[02:48:00]  You know what I mean?  She was totally naked.  I don't know, but I don't know anything about it, you know?  She hadn't shaved it in a month.  I know, I know.  It's like a jungle.  I know, I get it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I'll see you next year, man, you know?  You're leaving for a year.  That's it.  Well, I know.  I come back every year.  Now, can I say something right now?  Yeah.  I was fine when I left.  Now, I'm back because of you.  Why?  We're just talking.  Yeah, because it's 8-6.  I don't know what you're doing right now, man.  We're talking.  I don't know where this is going.  I don't know what you're doing.  After comments like that, it became clear that in order to gain closure, we would have  to follow a panic-stricken Bobby Lee down the elevator. 
[02:48:30]  It's been fun.  I guess it's a pleasure.  All right.  Yeah, I guess so.  You're coming down with me?  I guess so.  Get out of here.  No, get out of here, man.  No.  What are you doing?  You get out of the elevator.  No, no, no.  I don't like it.  I just make sure you get out of here.  All right, but this is what I'm going to do.  Once I get outside of the building, I'm running.  And I don't want to run.  No.  But you're making me do it.  Okay.  All right.  Did you like the building?  I mean, it's a nice elevator.  Whatever, man.  What's wrong?  Nothing's wrong, man.  I don't understand.  You're being so closed off right now.  I'm in an elevator.  There's two things.  Elevators and now this. 
[02:49:00]  What's wrong with elevators?  You don't like elevators?  This guy is bigwig at the Carolines, man.  Greg Charles, that's his real name.  But my point is, I want to get booked back.  Yeah.  And now they think I'm crazy.  But they like that.  They think I'm a lunatic.  I'm not a lunatic, man.  But it's okay.  Like, you know, you're eccentric.  Right?  You're a comedian.  Yeah, I'm just a guy who, you know, tries to survive in the world.  You're running away.  Bye, Bobby Lee.  Apparently, he doesn't like interviews as Bobby Lee literally ran across the lobby of the building and out onto 6th Avenue. 
[02:49:30]  Hopefully, he'll manage to recover enough to be completely broken down again the next time he stops by the show.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and this is Ben.  Backstage with ONA.  He really ran?  Yes, he literally ran across the whole lobby.  This is not the serious building.  There's three floors in this building that are serious.  The rest is serious or regular business people. 
[02:50:00]  People in suits come in here, and all of a sudden, at, you know, 10.30 in the morning, Bobby Lee is running across this giant lobby and out onto 6th Avenue and running down the sidewalk.  Holy mackerel.  Ah!  Yeah, Patty with her hands over her head.  So what are we going to do with Bobby Lee?  We want him to be part of the show, but there's obviously a problem.  I mean, we're not doing anything crazy with the guy that we haven't done with other people.  He's just, he's not used to coming on to shows that aren't, like, hacky. 
[02:50:30]  Like, he likes to come on to a show and control the room.  He's got this thing where he gets super paranoid if he's not in total control.  Can we get him on the phone today?  Where is he, back in L.A.?  I don't know, but we could probably do this.  Well, is there a way for our listeners to write him for real and go, look, we love you on the show.  We need you back on their show.  Well, he said...  And I'm being honest.  Don't fuck with him.  He said people were...  Because I think he could be strong for this radio show.  He said people were emailing him on Facebook before and calling him gay for spitting on Bobo's penis. 
[02:51:00]  That's going to help.  So obviously he reads his Facebook.  If you find his Facebook, maybe send something that says you were good on the show.  Yeah, for real.  Yes, not like...  No.  You're gay for spitting on...  No, because we want him back.  There's a major problem here.  I don't think he's coming back until next year.  No, no, it's next year.  We just got, you know something?  Because this is what happened last year when we made believe there was an earthquake in New York.  New York City.  And we thought we smoothed things over.  Like, okay, he calmed down.  He'll be back.  No, that was a year almost to the day. 
[02:51:30]  So he ain't fucking around when he says, I'll see you next year.  One year from now.  One year.  Could you picture two Christmases a year?  What makes Christmas so special?  One visit from Bobby Lee a year is all we got.  And doesn't he understand if he only comes in here once a year that we have to make it really special?  Like if he came in on a semi-regular basis, we would do just regular radio with the guy.  Yeah.  He said that you guys are juggernauts.  And he loves coming on here and plugging his show.  He comes on here to plug.  Yeah.  But he is not comfortable in here and he hates being in the studio with you. 
[02:52:00]  You remember when we were doing like just regular radio with the guy?  I could see it.  Yeah.  In his eyes.  Like he was falling apart.  I'm like, Bobby, we're on your side.  We're all together here.  When you guys, he was outside on Friday.  He was outside the studio for like an hour and a half waiting to come on.  And he came over to me at one point out of nowhere.  I was sitting at my desk and he came over and he goes, what are they talking about right now?  Obama?  I don't know anything about this.  Are they going to call me in?  What am I going to talk about?  What are they going to do to me?  What are they going to do?  And I go, no.  There you go. 
[02:52:30]  There's your Bobby Lee update.  I heard he was great at Caroline's, by the way.  I heard he was great.  It's very funny.  I've never seen his stand-up.  It's good.  Really good.  Guy knows what he's doing.  Yeah, he's fucking funny, but he is a nut.  He's crazy.  He really is.  Travis, have we done the fishing bit in a while?  Yeah, we did it Friday, I think.  Can I play it here or is that bad?  No, actually, we did it on...  Yeah, you can do it now.  You sure?  Yep.  All right, we're going to go to break with Jim Norton, who had to leave the show.  He's filming a movie.  He'll be back Friday. 
[02:53:00]  Dirk and Steve took his fishing bit and did some nice stuff with it.  And rumor has it Coke Logic is thinking about animating this motherfucker.  Anything Jimmy does that Coke Logic animates is gold.  You have a choice.  The fishing bit, the caveman bit, or Jimmy as Jimmy Rooney could be funny, too.  Yeah, I know.  It's your choice, my friend.  But get that animation in, too.  Hi. 
[02:53:30]  Fucking depressed.  Poor Kay.  I had a goddamn car accident that was all over the news yesterday.  Oh.  Eight fucking people died.  A little north of the city, one of the highways.  Just make it basic for everybody else in America and the world.  In America.  More and more people listening outside Canada and America.  It's unbelievable.  Yeah.  The numbers are up.  So there was eight people dead on a Sunday afternoon. 
[02:54:00]  Kids involved.  They're dead.  There's one survivor.  And she's pretty much, I think it's a she.  It's a five-year-old girl, I believe.  You're kidding.  And she's like, she's not going to make it.  If she does, it's going to be just a horrific life for her.  It's grim.  And then you're like, what the fuck happened?  Right?  Yeah.  Turns out some dope went on the highway the wrong way?  Yeah.  It was the one that was driving the minivan with all the kids in it.  How's that happening?  How do you do that? 
[02:54:30]  I don't understand how you get on a highway the wrong way.  It's too much.  There's too much work involved.  These stories come up, what, a couple times a year?  Yeah.  And then when you're driving on a highway and you see the exit ramps and the entrance ramps,  then you kind of do a little exercise in your head, like, well, how would I?  And then, you know what I mean?  Yeah.  And you're looking at the backs of signs.  You're just looking at the backs of signs and shit.  Yeah.  So that's like a clue.  And then where it says, do not enter, wrong way. 
[02:55:00]  You see those.  Those are all over the place.  How do you get on the wrong fucking side of traffic?  And then if you do get to that situation, you realize immediately, because it's a Sunday  afternoon, there's a lot of cars, wouldn't you just, like, just pull over?  Yep.  Yeah.  You would just, like.  Was it on the.  All right.  So she obviously was going the wrong way on an exit ramp.  Right.  So she's entering on an exit ramp.  So did the accident occur on the exit ramp itself? 
[02:55:30]  People, like, just leave the highway?  I don't know.  I'd like to know how long she was driving on this road the wrong way.  Before the head-on collision.  They said it was one of the worst they've seen.  Yeah.  A lot of the officers and whatnot on the scene, they're just like, dude, it was just horrific.  Probably going to wind up making another stone face out of the cops.  You didn't have a legendary police officer when you were growing up, when you were in school?  No, no, no.  We had a legendary one.  His name was Stone Face. 
[02:56:00]  He came in because.  We were always scared of Stone Face whenever we drove around.  It's like, look out, Stone Face is out tonight.  I think Stone Face is working tonight.  Stone Face does the night shift.  Look out for Stone Face.  Stone Face was this old, older cop.  Seasoned veteran?  Seasoned veteran.  And he would always, like, really fuck with the high school kids that would be driving  around at night.  But he was cool, though.  Yeah.  We didn't realize that, though, because his legend was more than he really was. 
[02:56:30]  But the thing about Stone Face was, he was a seasoned vet.  He probably had, like, three years left before he retired.  But the story was, he was only in his mid-20s.  But he saw one of the most horrific car wrecks.  One wreck.  He saw it was so bad.  It was like just high school kids in pieces all over the road.  For real?  Or are you just, like, making up some kind of legend?  Oh, okay.  This was like, this is what was told to you.  It was told to everybody about Stone Face.  Okay. 
[02:57:00]  And that's why he's got it out so bad for the high school kids that are out driving.  Because he, his hair turned white.  Meanwhile, he just had gray hair.  He was an old guy.  Yeah, I know that.  And he had, like, wrinkles.  And he had very, we called him Stone Face because he never smiled or anything.  And he had very chiseled, like, man features.  But it was like, dude, he's fucking 25.  I'm not shit, man.  He's fucking 25.  He's got that white hair.  Turned white over fucking night, man.  Wow.  He fucking saw that big wreck and just got old overnight. 
[02:57:30]  And now he just hassles the fucking kids.  Meanwhile, he's just an old cop fucking, you know, that would sit.  But the legend is Stone Face, dude.  Stone Face.  Shit.  Fucking Stone Face.  Stone Face.  He'd give you.  Never want to get pulled over.  If you got pulled over and looked in the mirror and just went, you turn to your friends  and went, dude, it's fucking Stone Face.  I'm fucked.  At this point, it's hack because we've talked about this many, many times.  But, you know, drunk driving was pretty much, like you said, a sport when we were growing  up.  Yeah.  And if you were pulled over with your friends and everyone was hammered, what do they do 
[02:58:00]  every time?  They didn't arrest nobody.  No, they tell you to take it easy or they tell you, you go, which one of you drank less  than this guy?  Right.  And then they drive or he'd throw your keys.  There you go.  Down the little ravine of the highway or wherever you are and say, I don't want to see you on  the road.  I'm going to pass by here in a couple hours.  The car better still be here and you better be asleep.  Right.  That would be wrong.  Or he would, you know, do the rest of his shift and then come back with your keys going,  you're not going anywhere until I'm done with my shift. 
[02:58:30]  And if you were close enough to your house, he'd follow you home.  Yeah.  So it's all right.  Go home.  I'll follow you.  Yeah.  You know, it's changed.  I hate to say it and be the guy, but it's changed for the better.  You know, it was pretty crazy out there when we were growing up.  Holy shit.  Some nights I don't even know how we got home.  Ah.  Yeah.  Look at that.  See?  They're saying.  That's right.  I knew Stoneface.  I grew up in Greenlawn.  Yes.  Stoneface was in Greenlawn.  Greenlawn area?  Elwood.  I'm a Greenlawn guy. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah.  Suffolk cop.  I don't remember Stoneface.  Oh, dude.  Stoneface.  All right.  I wonder if he's still working.  Dude.  Yeah.  He's still on the.  Well, he was only 25 then.  Right.  Rob, Long Island.  Yeah.  This turns out, this stupid accident, the lady lived on my street.  I don't really know her, but now I'm looking at a house and this thing is freaking me out.  But here's a question.  A lot of people now use these navigation systems to kind of, like, tell them where to turn.  Yeah.  They don't have to think too much and they can yack it up.  Right.  Is it possible that this may have been caused by that? 
[02:59:30]  We don't know that yet, but, you know, if you make a left, you make a left.  You know, that kind of, you know, something, we don't really think much about what we're  doing when we're driving with an av on, when you don't know where you are.  And if it tells you to make a left, a lot of times you just do it.  They usually say make a left as the left is actually 100 feet up the road, but there's  another left turn right there.  So make next left.  And meanwhile, the next left is a one way.  Right.  Then the one after that.  You know.  Okay.  That could happen.  I've been using the GPS a lot lately because I finally got a new car and, you know, welcome 
[03:00:00]  to the year what?  Love the GPS.  Welcome to the year what?  2005?  Yeah.  How many years behind am I?  And when they say turn left now or whatever it is, that is fucking dangerous.  Yeah.  Because we all like, we all jump in our cars and we don't know how we got to our destination.  I'm like, what the fuck?  I know I was texting or whatever, right?  I don't remember the last five miles.  And then you got a GPS that goes turn left now or whatever the actual prompt is.  Yeah.  And I feel myself sometimes going, oh, well, they're telling me it's okay to turn left 
[03:00:30]  now.  And of course, there's mew, mew, mew.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Meanwhile, when it's safe.  When it's safe is what they should be saying.  When there's no cars coming.  But sometimes it's just a little thing in the back of your head.  You're like, oh, you're ready to just turn because they're telling you turn left now.  It's autopilot.  I remember at least maybe two or three stories, at least in the last year where somebody listened  to their GPS a little too hard.  And, you know, it was somebody's thing was yelling at him to turn left or something. 
[03:01:00]  So he turned left right onto train tracks.  Oh, right.  Okay.  So why would you?  Yeah.  But I mean, just because your GPS says to like turn like your GPS knows you can still visually  inspect and see that you should not be turning left onto the train tracks.  Your GPS knows it probably wanted him on the train tracks.  The monster's in yellow today.  I, I, you know something, completely distracted, took me out of it, took me out of the whole  fucking break.  What the fuck does she look like in yellow?  What does she look like in yellow?  I'll tell you right now if I can find a picture. 
[03:01:30]  Hold on.  Are you got it?  Because it's killing me.  There's a resemblance there.  Uh, okay, let me, uh, say hi to Kent in New York.  Kent.  Hello?  Hey, Emma.  It's Gabriel.  Whatever.  All right.  What's up, Gabriel?  Yeah.  Uh, the reason that she went onto the wrong side of the road is the highway, there's no  exit and on-ramp street to ease into.  It's just a left or right.  So, the part of the highway, if it's not busy and, you know, she doesn't know the area, 
[03:02:00]  she'll just assume, oh, she's, she'll just make a left.  The wrong way sign is further, like, you have to look.  Yeah, wait a minute.  Doesn't, isn't there a no left turn sign?  No, the wrong way sign.  I don't mean the wrong way sign.  I, I, I mean, if, if, if it's an intersection like you're talking about.  Yeah.  There should be a no left turn sign or something.  Are you saying it's easy to make that wrong, uh, turn?  If you're an idiot, yeah.  Okay.  If you're an idiot.  Well.  That's just it.  Well, I mean.  You know which way traffic goes. 
[03:02:30]  If it's, it's, it's, there's a lot of idiots that are driving out there right now as we  speak.  Yes.  Exactly.  Those are filled with idiots.  God.  Fucking A, man.  Now we all have to be, like, like, sad and think, holy shit, how horrific is this one?  Uh, thank you, sir.  Let me, uh, say hi to Kevin in Utah.  Kevin.  Hey, guys.  Morning, boys.  Hey.  No, this is more on the lines of a horrific wreck.  They're in the small town that I grew up in.  There was a, uh, off ramp.  Wait, sorry, Danny. 
[03:03:00]  And there you go.  Oh, yeah.  The cowardly lion, the monster looks like.  Very good.  Uh, what do you, uh, where are we?  Kevin, go ahead.  Sorry.  All right.  No, there was an off ramp that was being built and they hadn't created that and  tarred it, they hadn't paved it, and so it was just dirt.  Well, these kids take this wreck and they lose control and they get partially, uh, thrown  out.  Well, they end up getting decapitated, three of them.  Well, the cop, the first cop that shows up on scene, they're going around looking for 
[03:03:30]  these heads.  All right.  Well, it comes, the cop stumbles across his head.  He looks down with a flashlight.  It's his son.  Ta-da!  Thousand Ways to Die.  Yeah, exactly.  You're perfect for the show.  Well, the second part of the story is, two years later, another wreck, same cop, he finds  his second son.  He lost two kids to two different fire wrecks in a two-year span. 
[03:04:00]  Yeah, we all thought that was kind of bizarre.  Yeah, it's horrific.  But that's all I got.  Punch it up, boys.  All right, thank you.  Uh, James, the trucker, well, let him say it.  He's a trucker.  Uh, James.  Yeah, I just wanted to say that GPS is for faggots.  Anyone that's too lazy to read a map the old-fashioned way deserves to die.  All right, go fuck off.  Look, there's a big leap between taking your GPS and turning on to train tracks and going 
[03:04:30]  back to a triple-A triptych.  A triptych.  I've had it.  Remember the triptych?  Fuck that, maps, everything else.  I like driving with a navigation system.  Yeah, absolutely.  It's, it's, it makes driving fun.  Hey, Ant.  What happens if your GPS tells you to turn left and you go into a lake?  I wouldn't do that.  Well, your GPS says turn left.  I look, dummy.  And my GPS is smart. 
[03:05:00]  It doesn't make mistakes.  Ever.  Oh, wait a minute.  I forgot.  It tells you in German how to go.  Right?  It could.  Mm-hmm.  You keep trying.  You keep trying to make a joke.  One will pop out eventually.  All right, look at that bell on you.  Let's go to Joe in Connecticut.  Joe.  Yeah, I was driving and I had the old Garmin and I hadn't updated my maps in a long time  and we were headed to this party and it took me down this really windy back road that made 
[03:05:30]  me take a left and then a right and we're cruising and it's dark and we couldn't see shit.  And all of a sudden a fucking headstone pops up out of nowhere.  I almost ran down like three headstones with my car because it took me to the middle of  an old graveyard.  You're in a cemetery?  I got to tell you that when we were planting my grandmother over at, where is that, Pine  Lawn over there?  Oh, that's where my grandma is too.  I wonder if they're very close to each other.  Maybe.  Oh, that'd be nice.  They could chat.  A little chit-chat. 
[03:06:00]  Oh, go on.  Jaw just dropped.  Great.  Now we can't chat anymore.  Time's over.  Great.  All right.  Sorry.  You're chatting until that jaw drops.  Until the jaw drops.  Ah!  Whoa!  Yeah, and then we're in the cemetery and my navigation system shows all the roads in the  cemetery.  Yeah, how creepy is that?  Because you know how you could get lost in that fucking place.  Sure.  Little twists and turns and fucking...  They're coming for you, Barbara.  I'm a big fan when the GPS has a brain fart and all of a sudden it says your destination's 
[03:06:30]  on the left and it's like a field or something.  No, it isn't.  No, it's not.  You idiot.  It isn't.  What are you doing?  Lady...  All right, let's...  Where have you taken me?  Let's go to Mike in Pittsburgh.  Mike.  Mike?  Hey, guys.  You guys were talking about how far one of the people have made it.  Just last week in Pittsburgh, a lady went two miles the wrong way from our market 57  to 55 before going head-on with a semi.  Head-on with a semi.  Great.  Head-on with a semi and a Ford escape.  And she had two fucking miles to figure it out. 
[03:07:00]  Damn.  How the fuck do you go two miles without seeing another car?  Without...  Not only that, you're seeing...  The thing that would get me is the backs of signs.  You're seeing the pole or the post or the whatever fucking metal thing that holds the sign up  and then the back of it and the bolts.  Like, don't you know that there's a problem?  So as you get on the highway, you're now...  Think this over, okay?  You're on the left side...  Yeah.  Going the wrong...  It's so obvious. 
[03:07:30]  Isn't it every time?  The headlights are coming at you.  Even if it's a divided highway where you can't see the other one.  But you see the traffic on the other side.  Well, let's say it's even...  Let's say this.  That it's divided and you can't even see the other side.  Because you know how sometimes highways, like 95 especially, would divide...  Sure.  And you won't even be able to see the northbound lane if you're southbound.  But you know, like, they still put that guardrail to the left and the shoulder to the right.  You know, because you just...  Oh, right, right, right.  You just know when you're driving that that's how roads are laid out. 
[03:08:00]  Right.  So if you're driving and the shoulder is to the fucking left of you and the guardrail thing is to the right,  it's common fucking sense.  Yes.  They just don't have it anymore.  It's just like the guy would drive into a lake.  If you drive into a lake, you fucking deserve to die.  You're an idiot.  Yeah.  Thin the herd.  And Mike's saying that she drove for two miles.  I bet she realized and goes, well, I'll just get to the next exit.  I'll get off the next exit.  And I'll figure this out.  I'll figure this out.  The next exit's eight miles, six miles on the road.  Cars hurtling towards me.  Right.  At double the speed now.  Relative speed is now 120 miles an hour. 
[03:08:30]  We've all been in a plane and you see the planes coming at you.  Oh, yeah.  You've looked out the window and see the planes, let's say, going L.A. as you're coming back from L.A.  You realize how fast you're going at that point.  Oh, they look like fucking missiles.  Yeah.  Imagine what cars look like.  It's just, oh, we're moving kind of slow.  This is nice.  But when you see closing speed.  Yeah.  Whoa.  Your brain can't even like wrap itself around it.  Yeah.  Because you're like, wow, that is like, that's what?  That's impossible, right? 
[03:09:00]  I have something to gauge how quickly we're moving.  Thank you, Mikey.  Yep.  Homer Simpson.  I'm a Bobby Lee fan after hearing him on the show.  That's good.  But we can't get to you right now.  Coworker's GPS directed him into a building.  Let's say hi to Stryker.  Stryker.  Stryker.  Good evening.  Yeah.  The trucking company I work for, about half of us have GPSs.  And I've got one that's specific for trucks.  So it gives me like truck routes, low clearances, et cetera.  My coworker has one that's designed for cars. 
[03:09:30]  Oops.  He programmed.  He's had two accidents since by the end.  First, he hit a low bridge.  Try putting a 13-foot truck under an 11-foot bridge.  Happens all the time here in New York on the parkways.  Yeah.  Well, then here about a month and a half ago, he programmed in the direction.  It's going down the street.  The GPS had turned left.  He turned left and ran into the overhang of a building.  Jesus.  The drive-thru of a building.  Drive-thru, yeah. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  It took out totaled the truck.  And there's about $250,000 damage to the building.  My favorite is when you see the U-Haul trucks with the big fucking can opener top.  It's just been ripped back.  And, yeah, they went through a drive-thru.  Like, the idiot couldn't even remember for one trip with his stupid moving truck and his stupid family and his stupid goods in the back.  Well, you know, it's taller than his car.  You want to talk about people having head-ons going the wrong way. 
[03:10:30]  We had one here about 10 years ago.  Three chicks, they were drunk.  They drove seven and a half miles the wrong way on two different interstates before hitting a semi head-on.  So it's a semi.  Yeah, why is it always a semi?  It's always a semi.  You never hit fucking.  Those semis are frightening.  Thank you, Stryker.  All right.  Wow.  I didn't know this one.  Andrew the trucker.  Andrew.  Yeah.  That parkway must be pretty easy to get onto the wrong way because this is the second crash just yesterday. 
[03:11:00]  There was one early in the morning that five people were injured 20 miles north.  So I guess it's easy to get on the wrong way.  I don't understand it.  I guess.  You've got to put spike strips down.  Yeah, right.  Put those one-way spike strips so you blow your fucking tires out.  I was thinking that.  That's not a bad idea because you should be backing up on those things anyway.  If you're going the right way, you know what I mean.  Tim on Long Island.  Tim.  Hey, guys.  What's happening?  Hey, man.  I was about two years back.  I was on Sunrise Highway heading back to my house.  And all of a sudden, I see a car next to me. 
[03:11:30]  I see taillights, but it's on the opposite side of the road.  Oh, shit.  And literally, I'm driving parallel to the car just waiting for something to fucking hit it.  Yeah.  And this car went, like, a solid.  I stayed next to it for 10 miles hearing cars screech around it.  Jesus.  You didn't beep your horn or try to flash your lights or something?  I tried everything.  I mean, like, part of, you know, throwing something out my window.  This woman ended up being hammered.  Oh, were you able to look at it?  Did you see her face and everything?  Yeah.  Like, clear as hell.  Like, driving next to somebody. 
[03:12:00]  All fucked up?  Was she all fucking blah, blah, blah?  Dumb part.  Yeah.  Just fucking lost in space.  Struck as shit.  Wow.  And the cops ended up getting on the same road behind her, finally, and followed her all  the way.  She made it all the way home.  And then probably couldn't understand why she was in trouble.  What did I do?  Dummy.  Yeah, I was on the Sunrise Highway, like, two years ago and stuff.  You ever get in a situation where you've got to wake someone up on the highway?  Yeah.  Those are the best ever.  That's what those little lines are for.  Those have woken me up more than once.  Oh, yeah.  Little rumble strips. 
[03:12:30]  But, I mean, you're old enough to remember roads that didn't have those.  Yeah.  Wake up.  Yeah, it's called the medium.  Wake up.  Yeah, then it was a guardrail or something.  That would wake you up.  Yeah, the guardrail usually helps you out here and there.  The rumble strips, one of the greatest inventions ever for tired drivers.  Oh, yeah.  You hit that for a split second.  You are wide awake.  One time what woke me up.  The whole car vibrates.  You think you're going to come back through?  Oh, yeah.  We know.  Everyone knows.  Thanks, Tim.  Those, like, three-foot-high plastic dividers. 
[03:13:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Where, you know, I don't know how else to describe them, but they're on, like, a flexible  mount, so if someone does hit them, like, they're not completely broken.  It's like you're doing the slalom.  Yeah.  I woke up to my side view mirror, just, I was like, oh, I think I am about to fall  asleep driving.  It sounds like a playing card in spokes.  Exactly right.  I was right there.  Oh, shit.  Motherfucker, we're together on that one.  Good job.  Yeah, but to waking someone up as they're in their car, pretty much falling asleep or  already out.  I remember that shit.  My brother wouldn't fucking realize he was falling asleep once. 
[03:13:30]  We were driving down from Kingston or something.  We had some stupid gig up there.  And we're driving down, and he just kept weaving off the road.  And I'm like, Joe, you've fallen asleep.  He goes, no, I'm good.  I'm good.  And I actually had to wait then and stare at him and wait and go, all right, I have to  now wait for him to fall asleep and go off the road a little bit and then, like, have  him wake up himself and have me just looking at him.  Oh, Jesus.  So I'm sitting there waiting, and he nodded off, and the car started drifting to the 
[03:14:00]  left, hit the rumble strip, and then the grass, and he woke up, and then he turns and looks  at me, and I'm smiling, looking right at him.  I go, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You're not falling asleep.  You all right, Mr. Wade?  He's like, all right, fuck you.  You can drive.  And then I started falling asleep.  God bless the people that could, well, like yourself, that could fall asleep as a passenger.  No way.  No way.  No how.  No how.  Even if it's a bright Saturday afternoon, you know everyone got a good night's sleep,  there's nothing, it's just a regular drive, I can't be the guy, I can't sleep in a car 
[03:14:30]  if someone else is driving.  I'm always sleeping.  Because then my mind starts getting crazy, like, I'm convinced the guy's fast asleep  or whoever's driving the car.  No.  I can't sleep in a car ever.  I love sleeping in the car because you get there instantly.  You're like, okay, we're leaving.  Time machine, right?  Well, yeah, I call it time machine.  We'll leave in Atlantic City.  All right.  Hey, we're home.  Cool.  Boy, that was nothing.  No, it was five hours of traffic, motherfucker. 
[03:15:00]  You slept through the whole thing.  When I was doing radio in Geneva, I would, because I was still hanging out at, you know, Geneseo  because why not?  You know, just because you graduate, why would you leave a college atmosphere?  Just hang out.  You're stupid if you leave a college atmosphere after you graduate.  You have friends, broad spooze.  Yeah, I still have the college thing happening.  I was starting my radio career, so I would drink, happy hour, whatnot, and then go do overnight  radio in Geneva.  It was a long time.  How old is too old, though, to be like, hey guys, I'm still hanging.  Where's the kegger?  We had a few of those guys in my frat house. 
[03:15:30]  When I was pledging, I'm like, that guy's like 30.  What is he still doing here?  A little too old to be here.  30.  God, I wish I was 30.  Oh, God, that's fucking like nine years ago.  Yeah.  Wow.  I know, the big 4-0.  Yeah, coming up.  Fuck the countdown.  And so now I'm dead tired because I got a hangover, didn't sleep, overnight show,  6 in the morning, now I'm driving back to Geneseo, fell asleep at the wheel.  I woke up because there was a shitload of deer in the road. 
[03:16:00]  I don't know if the subconsciously, like my eyes saw it.  I don't know.  Not much to the story, really, but I didn't hit any deer.  Would have wiped them out.  But when, holy shit, have you ever had this?  Holy shit, how long have I been asleep?  And you don't have a clue if it was a couple seconds or minutes or whatever.  You know what I mean?  There are times, though, well, I've heard, I haven't done this, but times where people  do fall asleep with their eyes open.  They're completely out, but they're actually asleep but driving. 
[03:16:30]  And as long as there's nothing major going on, they can kind of hold the road, but they're  technically asleep.  That's weird.  Me, I've always been the old fucking the head goes down, the eyes shut, I'm on a pillow,  I'm drooling, I'm just fucking like completely out.  And then you wake up and go, holy shit, how long have I been asleep?  This adrenaline now that's in me should last a good 30 seconds to keep me up.  Well, that's what sucked in my situation.  I was scared out of my fucking mind.  I pulled right over.  I'm like, all right, I got to sleep now. 
[03:17:00]  But like you just said, because now you have the adrenaline, I couldn't sleep on the side  of the road.  So then I continued anyway.  You start shaking at some point.  I was fucking scared.  You start thinking about, what the fuck?  Wait a minute.  I don't remember even being here or driving this far.  Uh, my GPS tells me to turn around on certain bridges.  Oh, we can play that game where you decide it.  Fell asleep at the wheel, woke up to a semi's headlights, uh, facing, defacing me, wow, someone's  Oh, facing me, yeah.  Facing me, turns out to be a tow truck hauling a semi. 
[03:17:30]  Oh, that's, that's happened a couple of times where...  All right, let's do that.  Yeah, not asleep, but, um...  Rick and Philly.  I've seen that one.  Yeah, man, that scared the shit out of me, driving down the highway like five in the  morning, and all of a sudden I'm, you know, half asleep trying to stay awake, and all  of a sudden I see semi-lights coming straight at me, and it's like, there's no way to get  over it, and I'm freaking out, well, here, I'm just catching up to a tow truck, never  saw that, or for some reason they tow it with the fucking lights on.  Yeah, that's weird.  Why would they do that? 
[03:18:00]  I'm tortured.  Yeah.  But you know what's even better?  You ever have someone fall asleep in your car?  Or, just, wait, not off, as soon as they do, just take your arm, and reach out, like,  you know, when you go to stop the car, and you try to, like, someone puts their arm out,  like, that's going to do anything, and just scream, and watch that person wake up.  Like, it's just their pants.  That's kind of funny, man.  Or, if you drive, when you're driving, close one eye, if you're the driver, and lean your  head back a little bit, and you can see out of your other eye, but the passenger...  Oh, yeah, it's a fun trick. 
[03:18:30]  I've actually done that one.  I love that one.  I've done that one before.  People next to you will start beeping and everything, and you just sit there.  I'm not even talking about that.  I'm talking about your passenger in your car.  Oh, no, I'm talking about out the driver's window, dude.  Yeah, you can do that, too.  That's another good one.  You keep your hand low on the steering wheel, and you close your left eye, and then you kind  of drift off, and then people pull up next to you, and they go, meh, meh, like trying  to wake you up, and you weave a little bit back and forth.  I like the holy shit one, though, man.  Holy shit.  I mean, I just do it for people in the car, but I'll try that. 
[03:19:00]  You know what?  Yeah, your passenger is out cold, and just scream, holy shit, when he wakes up in horror.  Holy shit.  Just go.  You gotta smack him in your chest with your hands.  Yeah.  Anytime you have someone...  No, I don't even want to go with that angle.  Just, you scream the holy shit to get the same reaction.  He wakes up like, what the fuck?  Are we going over a cliff or something?  Yeah.  And then just go, I love this song.  I love this song.  Holy shit.  Do you remember the train tracks in Green Lawn that were like a fucking ramp?  Can't remember the street, but yeah, you know. 
[03:19:30]  We'd lost one of our tenants.  Did you?  This is a bad memory.  One of my mom and dad's tenants didn't come home one night.  Because of that fucking train tracks?  I've told a story on the air.  It's a recent story.  The suicide note was left in the room I grew up in.  Yikes.  For real.  Yeah.  He decided to end his life on those tracks.  Right there on that hill?  Oh, yeah.  And the officer comes, because he left a suicide note on the windshield. 
[03:20:00]  He was renting a room for my mom after my dad's death.  That made it a lot of fun for everybody.  Yeah, that'd be great.  More fucking horrific shit happening to everybody.  So there was a suicide note on the windshield.  So when the police up there in Green Lawn found this horrific scene,  they found the note that the guy did on purpose.  He parked on the tracks.  So then they went to the house, because I guess on the note he explained where he lived.  And then my mom had answered the door.  The cops are there.  And they marched up to the room I grew up in.  And sure enough, in the room was a creepy suicide note. 
[03:20:30]  They finally changed the grade on that track.  Well, it was a giant hill.  You used to get airborne if you were going fast enough.  And it was a giant hill.  And there was a flatbed tractor trailer hauling a bulldozer.  And it tried to make it over that hill.  And just...  Oh, really?  Yeah, just started getting ground to a halt.  And train came.  You've never seen destruction like a train hitting a bulldozer on a tractor trailer. 
[03:21:00]  Wow.  So, yeah, that was a big fucking mess.  That was a biggie.  But that hill was ridiculous.  You obviously know which one I'm talking about.  You'd feel your shocks go right to the end before you were getting airborne.  Joe Curry was asleep in the passenger seat of my friend Frank's truck.  He had like a rover or something like that.  And he was like in that half-asleep, half-awake phase.  And he was just kind of driving.  And Frank goes...  He turns to Joe.  He goes, prepare for liftoff and hit those tracks. 
[03:21:30]  And Joe doesn't know.  He's just...  All of a sudden, he's driving.  And then he says, here's prepare for liftoff.  And then the car took off.  And he got up like, what the fuck?  That's awesome.  It was airborne.  Yeah, we would try to get airborne on that one.  Always caught air in my Baja bug.  My little dune buggy over that thing.  Fat air, yo.  They flattened it out, though.  Yeah, they ruined it.  It's more fun.  You could...  It was an evil Knievel ramp.  You would get those weird feelings low in your belly. 
[03:22:00]  You get...  Yeah.  And you'd almost back off a little before you hit it.  Because you knew it was like, this is...  I am flying.  Yeah.  This car is going to fly.  I drove for three hours and woke up as a herd of deer ran across the highway, was driving  the whole time.  There's no way you were driving for three...  Three hours?  Ken, come on.  Three hours?  Yeah, I was driving through Montana.  I ended up having a late night job where I thought I was going to be able to get a hotel. 
[03:22:30]  And I didn't get a hotel.  So I had to go do the job anyway.  And I got done with the job about two o'clock in the morning.  And I had to drive back three hours to get back to the nearest hotel.  And I don't remember a minute of the drive, except for waking up about 30 seconds, a couple,  three or four times.  And there were deer literally six inches from my car as I was driving by them at 90 miles  an hour on the freeway.  Jesus.  And you've...  There's nothing worse than when a fucking deer runs out in front of you. 
[03:23:00]  Yeah, that's some scary shit.  They will fuck your car up.  I don't miss that about Western New York.  They will fuck you up.  The fucking deer were everywhere.  Watch it out, guys.  Thank you, sir.  One more.  We got Joe in Missouri.  Joe.  Yeah.  Morning, boys.  Hey.  The white line on the highway, painted on the highway, is always on your right.  And the yellow line is always on your left.  There you go.  The line is fine.  Yeah, you would...  Pretty simple.  You would just feel like something's not right immediately. 
[03:23:30]  You can just see, yeah.  And the DPS stories, we locally there in Iowa, there was a truck driver following his DPS,  and it took him across an eight-ton bridge, and he collapsed the bridge.  Jesus.  Nice.  That's one picture.  Later, boys.  All right.  Let's go to Plum in New York.  This is the one I actually...  I missed the call by one here.  Plum, what do you got?  Hello, boys.  How are you this morning?  All right.  Hey, man.  Love you, and I love your show.  Oh, thank you, sir. 
[03:24:00]  Plum, plum.  So, gentlemen, listen, sometimes my wife and I, we do a lot of driving, and we'll drive  home to Virginia or something like that, and we'll be driving for an hour and a half  or so, and my wife will fall asleep in the car next to me, and all of a sudden, out of  nowhere, she wakes up and just goes, bleh, and reaches and grabs the freaking wheel.  While you're driving.  Oh, shit.  Keep your dreams to yourself, dummy.  Yeah, really.  I've actually started letting her grab the wheel.  Just like, what are you going to do?  Yeah.  If it happens, hey, why not?  Don't worry about the kids in the back.  They think it's fun.  Right on.  Good story, Plum. 
[03:24:30]  Thank you, sir.  Steve in Arizona.  Steve.  Yeah, I got a long drive from Arizona to Wyoming, where I work, so sometimes I'll just pull  over the side of the road just to sleep, be so tired, and some would startle me awake,  and I'd just slam on the brakes, even just parked.  Just look up and slam on the brakes thinking I was about to hit something.  Yeah, sometimes when you wake up like that.  I was driving cross-country, and the white lines in the road for radar, I would jam on  the brakes, because I thought they were railroad ties in the middle of the street. 
[03:25:00]  Fuck, nice buzz.  So I'd wake up.  Yeah, no.  Nice buzz.  It was a sleep-induced buzz, because we were driving to California, so we actually made a  deal with each other.  We said, look, no beers.  We can't drink and drive cross-country.  We actually didn't.  We actually didn't, but it was just pure tiredness.  I was seeing things on the side of the road, like colorful jackrabbits and toys.  When you're, like, real, I mean, that tired, where you're dead tired.  Yeah.  Your fucking brain will really fuck with you. 
[03:25:30]  It really starts, like, you start seeing things, literally seeing things.  You're hallucinating, and your body is just so fucking tired.  You crash out.  It's like, yeah, I'm controlling a massive metal vehicle.  But...  Yeah.  Toilet crusher from Buffalo.  Oh, it's all about the bears now.  Someone hit a bear near downtown Buffalo on I-90.  I-190.  What the fuck?  Can you imagine hitting a bear? 
[03:26:00]  Those are pretty stout.  Pretty heavy.  You know, I think we did good for Monday.  I think so.  Fucking Monday?  Christ.  I wasn't even going to come in today.  Really?  Yeah.  I'd love to have gotten that phone call.  Really?  God damn.  Long weekend.  You know what's really fucked up about our hours, though?  Like, when you take a day off, you sleep through the time you would have been at work.  Right.  So by the time you get up, I always get up and go, I'd have been done anyway.  I know.  You're like, fuck, I just wasted one of my days. 
[03:26:30]  It's like I wasted a day.  I would have been done anyway.  I mean, it's nice.  I, you know, would have gotten to sleep a little more.  But the bottom line is, I'm up.  My work day would have been over, and now I didn't go in.  What's that tired thing?  Wasted a day.  If we could figure out that tired thing, this would be ideal.  Yeah, because this is fine now.  This is easy.  When I was getting up, this was not fun.  Right.  When that alarm went off, not fine.  Not fine.  Now fine.  Not fine at all.  Before not fine.  Not fine.  No, no, no, no, no.  All right.  There's more, just a lot of stories coming in. 
[03:27:00]  Stories?  I think we kind of did it.  Yes.  I do think so.  What else?  The Obama thing.  Obama.  I guess they're all having a beer at the White House.  Yeah, apparently they're all going to hook up for a beer or something to settle things.  It all happened after our show on Friday.  We were yelling and screaming, and man, did Obama do some backpedaling.  Oh, yeah.  I wonder when he knew he really messed up with that stupidly comment.  Well, when he had to say, I'm surprised at the attention this is getting, knowing that 
[03:27:30]  he shouldn't have been surprised and how the front page stories on all the news had nothing  to do with his health care plan, but everything to do with the cop from Cambridge and the  professor and him being arrested and Obama's remarks on it.  It was ridiculous.  And I think he realized, oh, damn, I made a mistake.  And now he's friends with this professor guy.  This professor.  How are they friends, by the way?  Old, you know, fucking scholars, whatever. 
[03:28:00]  They're just friends, I guess, from years of...  We don't know for sure, though.  Travel in the same circles.  It's that whole...  But the professor looks a lot older than Obama.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I think it's just one of those, you know, when you do what they do, you know each other.  Yeah, but we don't know any radio guys.  You would think we would know radio guys.  We're not fighting the oppressive white man.  Ah.  See, when you fight the oppressive white man, you know each other.  Ah.  You give each other the wink on the street leg, right?  You know who I'm talking about.  Because white people don't do that? 
[03:28:30]  The old blue eyes.  You know what I'm talking about, yo.  That's it.  But I think the professor, who is very outspoken, as we know, he's been suspiciously quiet during  this whole thing, when given the opportunity to really do what he does best, which is make  noise, make publicity for himself.  It's sort of like a Reverend Al motive kind of a thing.  And he's been quiet.  You think he got the old call from the White House?  Mm-hmm.  Listen, I put my neck out for you, and I wind up tripping over my own dick during a speech. 
[03:29:00]  I'm going to fix this, but you have to shut the fuck up.  Understood?  You know he got that call.  But there had to be a piece of evidence that we haven't seen that made Obama go, oh, fuck.  Oh, the 911 call?  Or maybe the audio?  Supposedly there was audio on the scene, maybe?  Yeah, yeah.  Radio audio and 911 call.  The witness.  Yeah, there were a bunch of stuff that just point to.  This guy was being a belligerent ass.  And although the cop probably could have let him go, he did nothing wrong by not letting 
[03:29:30]  him go.  And then by calling him a racist like that is way out of line.  By the officer at that point, or he had no choice?  At that point, he probably, they always got a choice.  He could have just said, go back in your house and shut up, you know, and then driven away.  But being accused of being a racist and then having the guy curse your mother.  You know what I would love to know?  And shit, it's like, you know, fuck you.  Oh, we know that?  Oh, yeah.  Because I'm thinking, what did Gates say where the officer said, that's it, I got it now. 
[03:30:00]  He's talking about his mama.  What did he say?  He said, your mama's, something about his mama, your mama give her name or something.  It was just something about his mother.  The cop's mother got brought into it.  He can't mess with people's mothers.  Wow.  And he brought him in.  But yeah, I think Obama told him to shut the fuck up.  We're going to settle this thing.  We're going to smooth it out, and that's it.  You think they all have a beer together now? 
[03:30:30]  It'll be very uncomfortable.  Like Sergeant Crowley.  One guy drinking a Bud, two drinking.  All right.  Jesus Christ.  Colt 45.  Colt 45.  All right.  Jesus.  OD.  What's some of the mother, Marlick?  Hurricane.  Right there, Danny.  Moo.  Where's our...  St. Hines.  We got to end with our beer clip now.  Can we go long-form beer clip, please?  Yeah, that's a great one.  Tequiza.  Tequiza.  Tequiza.  You didn't even know that. 
[03:31:00]  Stroh.  I like the Stroh.  No, I don't remember Stroh.  That's a poor man's beer.  It ain't even out there anymore, is it?  I don't know.  I used to drink the Stroh's.  You might be able to find it in a distributor.  You can get Stroh.  That was such a popular beer for 10 minutes with the Stroh's dog.  How do you remember that?  Remember the dog went in and got the Stroh's for the guy?  And maybe five other people out there remember.  Competing with the Budweiser dog.  Oh, really?  Stroh's was going after Budweiser?  Yeah.  That's cute.  Stroh.  Yeah, I think Sergeant Crowley, opportunity to go to the White House and have a beer with 
[03:31:30]  the president, that's pretty fucking huge.  Gates?  I don't think he wants to go to the White House and have a beer.  I don't think so.  Not for this situation.  He's going to feel a little awkward, I think.  He's going to look like the old Uncle T.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Yeah.  That's it on Obama.  Yeah, that's it.  We'll see what his next little thing that will bring his popularity even lower. 
[03:32:00]  It's under 50%, by the way.  I said that last week.  44.  Yeah.  Hey, just because you know your presidents.  Like, the one thing about Obama, he goes, he offers this beer thing.  I was trying to think to myself, did any other past presidents, like, say, hey, come down  to the White House, we'll have a beer?  Now for a beer?  It's kind of weird how these politicians are opening up in general, because who was campaigning?  Oh, was it Obama having the shot?  Or was it, oh, Hillary with the fake shot?  Oh, Hillary drinking a shot.  Right. 
[03:32:30]  Well, she's probably used to that.  But it was just weird to hear the president go, let's, you know, come down to the White  House and we'll have a beer.  Have a beer.  Reagan didn't do that shit.  We'll smoke some crack, I'll do the powdered one, and then we can go to Gurney and have  sex in a limo.  Now I want to hear that, too.  Ha, ha, Gurney.  That guy's an ass.  I'm no Obama fan, but that guy was a complete ass.  You think he's frustrated that no one's taking him seriously still?  No one ran with his story of sex in Gurney with the...  How great would it be that the guy is beyond accurate with the story? 
[03:33:00]  I know.  How do you live with yourself going, no, I'm telling you, this is what happened.  I swear, I blew the man.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  God damn.  All right.  We're out, I guess.  Yuppers.  That was a good one.  Good.  Monday, done.  I like when a black guy agrees with Anthony.  Let's get this in.  Keith, black guy, Atlanta.  Keith.  Hey, man.  How y'all fellas doing, man?  Hi, sir.  I just want to say this.  This man's been living around Carcadins for too long because he felt like he could say 
[03:33:30]  anything he want when any respectable black man knows when dealing with the police, you  don't say nothing.  This is a backhanded agreement.  But...  You usually just, you know, be quiet.  Say what you got to, you know what I'm saying?  Just be nice, be polite, and he'll go away and you go by the way.  Right.  Hey, just common courtesy between the two of you is a wonderful thing.  You know what?  I don't care what color you are.  That is a tough thing to do, what you just said. 
[03:34:00]  Because you want to say a lot of shit.  But you have to.  I understand.  But it's that battle you have in your fucking head.  Well, the consequences.  If you get pulled over and you feel like, oh, come on, man.  Or you're getting a parking ticket or whatnot.  Yeah.  You do have that inner struggle in your head going, I got to say something.  Yeah, I know.  But that's going to get you beat down or arrested or something.  Yeah, I understand.  I understand the consequences of it.  But it's hard to do sometimes.  So does Keith.  Hey, man.  Sometimes you just got to show a little restraint, man.  I mean, you might have to ring the bell for me because niggas understand this. 
[03:34:30]  Jesus.  Black people that's been living around white folks too long, they kind of lose their mind  and think, oh, I can say what the next white guy can say.  They think they're white people, right?  Hey, they kind of lose focus on who they really are.  They think they have the entitlement of a white man.  Damn near.  That's crazy thinking, Keith.  Jesus Christ.  I got to call spade to spade, man.  Sometimes you just got to know what's up just so you won't fuck around and get shot deep down 
[03:35:00]  or arrested.  I hear you, bro.  You got anything to plug, Keith?  First 48, what are you going to be on?  Lock up.  Lock up.  What do you got?  What do you got?  Actually, I went to repo to you guys.  It's straight up dissed it this morning.  Yeah.  I'm going to first 48 now.  All right.  There you go.  Now, that repo sounds horrible, but I'm not really sure what Ant was thinking when he  brought the Thousand Ways to Die to the show, but now I have to see that show.  Yeah, you do have to watch it for its awfulness.  Yep. 
[03:35:30]  Actually, I think I will check that out, man.  All right, brother.  All right, home.  All right, cuz.  Later, man.  All right, Keith, everyone.  I remember Billy Beer.  That stuff tasted like skunk shit.  Yeah, Billy Beer.  That's fucked up when the president's brother was hawking a beer with his name on it.  And a bad beer at that.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, guys, thank you.  Yes.  See you tomorrow.  See you tomorrow.  Tuesday.  Instead of Monday.  See you tomorrow. 
[03:36:00]  See you tomorrow. </pre>
