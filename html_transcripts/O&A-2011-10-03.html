<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a typically boisterous introduction featuring Larry King as a guest.  The initial discussion centered on recent sporting defeats suffered by the Jets, Yankees, and Cowboys, with Jim Norton contributing humorous anecdotes, including one about a Detroit Tigers catcher's mishap.  The conversation devolved into profanity-laced commentary on Tony Romo's quarterbacking abilities.  The death of Andy Rooney then became a topic, transitioning into a discussion of Pearl Jam's anniversary documentary, Eddie Vedder's private life, and Radiohead, including a funny story about Occupy Wall Street being misled about a potential Radiohead performance.

A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to a heated debate about the Occupy Wall Street protests, featuring cynical commentary from the hosts and phone calls from listeners, including a union electrician defending his high hourly rate.  Arguments ensued about individual responsibility versus systemic issues within the financial crisis.

The show then shifted to a discussion of Texas Governor Rick Perry's hunting lodge, controversially named "Niggerhead," and its implications for his presidential campaign.  This segued into a broader discussion of other presidential candidates.  The Occupy Wall Street protests were revisited before the segment concluded.

A subsequent segment started with Opie recounting a humorous incident involving his persistent doorman offering him bootleg movies.  This led to a discussion of the poorly-received film *Apollo 18*, followed by a debate about *Bridesmaids*.  One of the hosts then shared a bizarre dream involving Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, E-Rock, a blurry photo, and a series of strange encounters.  A caller claimed kinship with Mia Frampton, sparking a discussion of Peter Frampton's career and a comparison of *Frampton Comes Alive* and *Kiss Alive*. The year 1976 was discussed as a landmark year in music, with mentions of various artists. John Hinckley Jr.'s assassination attempt on President Reagan and his subsequent release were also briefly discussed. The segment concluded with further analysis of the host’s dream and his obsession with collecting celebrity encounters, including negative experiences with Jack Black and difficulties obtaining photos with Scarlett Johansson and Ryan Reynolds.  A recording of Chubby Checker performing "The Twist" was also played.

Another segment opened with the hosts unleashing highly offensive language directed at Jack Black.  One host then recounted another bizarre dream, leading to a discussion of listener-submitted "F.U." messages targeting various individuals and entities.  The O.J. Simpson trial verdict and the fall of the Berlin Wall were briefly mentioned.  The bulk of the segment was dedicated to "Jocktober," a recurring segment featuring critiques of other radio shows.  This year's focus was "Danger and Tracy" from Froggy 104, with extensive mockery of their segments, including the "Nashville Nugget" and repeated stories about Carrie Underwood.  The hosts also assigned virus-themed nicknames to themselves and staff.

Further critique of "Danger and Tracy" dominated another segment, focusing on a recurring Pledge of Allegiance segment featuring children.  The hosts heavily criticized the show's perceived lack of originality and talent, speculating about the authenticity of phone calls and jokes.  They also dissected the hosts' online presence, revealing Danger Frog's real name and low follower count. A caller, Denise, discussed her upcoming gallbladder surgery, leading to comedic tangents.  The segment also included a discussion of Jacktober and a separate radio show featuring "John and Jeff", and concluded with a graphic sexually explicit phone call from "The Fugitive" and clips of Andy Rooney's commentary on women in the workplace.

A segment focusing on Andy Rooney's retirement included clips of his broadcasts, commentary on his declining health, and darkly humorous observations about his final sign-off.  The hosts employed crude humor, including anti-Semitic and racist jokes. The segment transitioned to an after-show with Sam Roberts, discussing listener calls, a controversial t-shirt design, Sam's absence from *Special Delivery*, his feud with a caller named Kenny, the hosts’ anxiety dreams, and promotions for Trojan condoms.  E-Rock’s hairstyle was compared to that of a Nazi officer.

The final excerpt highlighted the continuation of "Jocktober," with Eric announcing a listener-driven segment the following day, giving instructions for submissions via Facebook and Twitter. He teased upcoming segments featuring "Sypha Sounds" and Rosenberg from Hot 97, mentioning a previous negative interaction with one host ("Chunky").  The show concluded with greetings to the Stengel brothers and a final plug for their Facebook page and live show.

[00:00:00]  And now, and now, the moment you've all been patiently waiting for.  Today's Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:00:30]  And now, and now, the moment you've all been patiently waiting for. 
[00:01:00]  Today's Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:01:30]  And now, and now, the moment you've all been patiently waiting for.  And now, and now, the moment you've all been patiently waiting for. 
[00:02:00]  And now, and now, the moment you've all been patiently waiting for. 
[00:02:30]  And now, and now, the moment you've all been patiently waiting for. 
[00:03:00]  What the hell am I doing here? 
[00:03:30]  Wait a minute, you want me to intro the Opie and Anthony show?  You got it, gotcha.  Hey, it's Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony show  right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  Oh, fuck yeah!  This place is insane!  You guys like to cuss on that, huh?  Yeah, a lot.  It's a weird show.  Yes, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about,  and certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio,  but I'm still proud to intro it. 
[00:04:00]  This show is so disordered.  Holy shit.  It's so fucking bizarre.  Everybody's not politically correct.  Opie and Anthony were saying that.  Well, then, turn off God dang Opie and Anthony, you dumbass.  We're experts from the already know this is going to be great radio,  so shut the fuck up.  Where else are you going to be able to say that and get paid for it?  Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is with great pride that I presented this,  by the way, one of the highlights of my career,  the Opie and Anthony show.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  It's that guy over there.  Me, me.  Morning.  Jets lost. 
[00:04:30]  Yankees lost.  Cowboys lost.  That's it.  Let's go home.  That's all the sports news you need right there.  My Jets look shitty.  Did your Yanks look shitty?  Well, they were held hitless until the end of the game,  and then they started rallying.  Yeah.  I thought they might have a good shot there,  but I think the rain actually gave them a chance at the end,  which was pretty fucking funny,  watching Detroit's catcher go back and slip in the Yankee batting circle. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, really?  It was the last out.  It was like, you know, that would have been, you know, catch, done,  everyone goes home.  And he fucking got into the batting circle there, the Yankee logo,  and just slipped on his ass, and the ball went clunk next to him.  Nice.  And I'm like, okay, all right, this is good.  They start rallying back, and then they get to Cano in the lineup.  Don't you know?  Don't you know?  It's actually the winning run at the plate. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  And just couldn't make it happen.  And that was it, huh?  Yeah, he knocked a little grounder, and that was that.  So all our teams lost, because, you know,  we all know Jimmy's a huge Cowboys fan.  Cowboys.  He's a massive Cowboys fan.  I literally, like I said, if you had said to me,  the fucking Cowboys beat the Yankees, I would have believed you.  Fucking Romo's a bum.  I found out what happened once I got here.  Yeah.  Good.  That's what you get for keeping him.  He's a fucking bum.  I could have told you five years ago, he's not Aikman.  He's not fucking Staubach.  He's not even Danny White.  He's a bum.  He might have blew a 24-point lead, maybe. 
[00:06:00]  Good.  That might have happened yesterday.  Cool.  And what did Travis say?  Two interceptions in a row for touchdowns?  Back-to-backing, belly-to-belly.  I shouldn't talk, because my Sanchez there isn't, you know.  Yeah, that didn't work out.  But he's no Romo.  Well, Sanchez only fumbled, you know,  the ball in the first possession of the first drive.  Well, I know.  I do know that.  Had a rainback for a touchdown.  That's embarrassing.  I had no doubt the Jets were going to lose that game  that I went to bed earlier.  They just looked so fucking bad from the get-go, as they say. 
[00:06:30]  So I said, you know what?  Get some sleep.  This is not happening today.  Their largest lead ever.  Yeah.  24 points.  That's just disgusting.  That's terrible.  That's bad defense, too.  It's got to be.  It couldn't just be the offense.  Well, I mean, well, Romo gave up, yeah,  two interceptions that were ran back for touchdowns  on two consecutive drives.  Why wouldn't he?  He's a fucking bum.  There's no Cowboy fan that must like this guy.  You can't like this guy.  Are they finally not?  Oh, no, not again.  Oh, boy, look at this.  Twice in a row.  Are they finally not blaming Jessica Simpson anymore?  Are they moving on from that? 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, there's no one.  Because they used to blame her for Tony Romo's play.  Of course.  But that's years ago now, right?  He is a fucking choke.  He's a choke.  I hate a choke in sports.  Hate it.  That's like doing a stand-up, and you're killing the clubs,  and then every time you do TV, you bomb.  That's what he is.  He's an actor who's amazing at auditions,  and every time he gets in front of the camera,  he forgets his lines.  Stinks it up.  He's everything that you hate.  Lions are 4-0.  I know they are.  That's great.  Bill's finally lost, so they're 3-1, right? 
[00:07:30]  But the Lions, 4-0.  Holy shit, what's going on?  Break up the Lions.  Hey, Andy Rooney's going to be dead in a year.  I just want to go on record and say that.  You're giving him that long?  Yeah, that's why he's leaving 60 minutes.  Are you giving him the old GLB?  Well, there's quite the drop-off between last year and this year.  Yeah.  And he had, what do you call it, the death rattle voice?  Death rattle voice.  It's weird.  Remember Andy Rooney when he talked like this?  Unbelievable things happening, and I'm talking about it.  And he's like, 
[00:08:00]  There's 30 years I've been doing this,  and when you see me out to dinner,  I just don't like to be annoyed.  It's like, that's not Andy Rooney.  There's too much air you can hear.  It's a death rattle.  You never want to hear that much air when someone's talking.  Just a death rattle when he talks.  I think that's why he's gone.  I think he might be.  I'm just saying.  He wants to spend some time with his family.  I think it's AIDS.  Well, it's AIDS.  He looked like he lost a few pounds there, too. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  You know, I don't know.  Something's going on with Andy Rooney.  Something's happening.  But Godspeed, Andy Rooney.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  30 years of nonsense.  It really has been just trouble.  30 years of who gives a fuck thoughts.  30 years.  Oh, wait.  That's our show.  Is he 92?  I think he's 92.  He was in his 60s when he finally hit.  It brings two things together.  I saw Pearl Jam 20 over the weekend. 
[00:09:00]  And Andy Rooney did a special thing on the kids of Seattle losing their minds because Kurt Cobain killed himself.  Yeah.  And he was just a curmudgeon back then and a fucking asshole that didn't understand the youth and what they were feeling at the time.  Really?  And then I was counting back.  It had to be, what, Kurt Bidde in 94, so what, 17 years ago?  So he was like 75 then.  Still like that, yeah.  And he just didn't get what the death of Kurt Cobain meant to a lot of people. 
[00:09:30]  You know what I'm saying?  I'm not saying it's right or wrong, but he just didn't understand it.  I remember when Benny Goodman died.  Trying to equate the two.  Crap.  But it was weird.  It's like, why don't you not talk about Kurt Cobain's death?  Because I don't think that's in your wheelhouse.  He's not qualified.  I don't think so.  No, man.  Do you have that?  It would be great to, yeah.  It was part of the Pearl Jam 20 documentary, which I fully enjoyed.  Yeah.  Yeah, because I really do like Pearl Jam a fucking lot, man. 
[00:10:00]  Go one.  Yeah.  It's all right.  The first 20 minutes when it just shows you how everything came together was really fucking cool.  Did it talk about, I'm reading Dove's book, which is fucking amazing.  Is it really?  Amazing.  Fuck, it's one of the best rock biographies I've read.  He's a smart man, so I would assume it would be a good read.  And he mentioned Pearl Jam because he was friendly with some guy who was a singer, I think.  I think the guy died.  Andrew Wood.  Was that who it was who died and then they became Pearl Jam?  Yeah, basically.  Yeah, in a nutshell. 
[00:10:30]  And Andrew Wood was from Mother Love Bone and this fucking guy was going to be a massive rock star.  Whoops.  And he fucking bit it.  Did he die right after they recorded their album?  Yeah, they recorded that album and then he OD'd.  How much longer?  I don't know.  Or how soon after?  Because I think then the record company said, well, there's no reason to work this fucking album.  The guy's dead.  We can't do anything with this.  And a lot of people really liked that album from Mother Love Bone. 
[00:11:00]  And he had all the qualities as Andrew Wood.  He was a rock star.  He was a fucking rock star.  Ready to go.  He's a Seattle guy?  Days before it was set to be released.  Days.  So then the record company, of course, they're like, well, there's no reason to work this.  Why would we work this?  The guy's dead and no one really knew who he was before he died.  Yeah, they waited until the next year to release it.  They didn't even release it?  No.  Well, that's the record labels.  Why would they?  Scumbags.  Why would they, you know?  But he had all the qualities.  They weren't some, like, giant, you know, national band that people were really waiting for this record to come out. 
[00:11:30]  But as far as Seattle goes, they were all looking at Andrew Wood, not Kurt Cobain.  They're like, this Andrew Wood is going to fucking put us on the map.  He was Chris Cornell's roommate.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Chris Cornell, man, in the documentary.  He was in it a lot.  He was in this Pearl Jam 20 documentary a lot.  I wish I saw it before he came in here.  I'm like, fuck.  And he's tearing up like crazy talking about Andrew Wood.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And what is it?  20, about 20 years later.  The guy died about 20 years ago.  22.  Yeah, they were pals.  Yeah, they were roommates. 
[00:12:00]  Because Andrew Wood just got out of rehab and needed a roommate.  And Chris Cornell's like, sure, I'm looking for a roommate.  What the fuck?  Might as well.  Boy, heroin run through Seattle, man.  No shit.  Fuck.  No shit.  Sure loved their heroin.  Those guys, there was a lot of people ODing in fucking Seattle and dope.  So then a couple of the guys from Mother Love Bone, yeah, they started looking for a new  singer and here comes Eddie Vedder and then they, you know, changed up the whole fucking  thing.  They became Pearl Jam, yeah.  Yeah.  What did the other members of Mother Love Bone do?  Because not all of them moved on to Pearl Jam. 
[00:12:30]  Let's see.  That I don't know.  I wonder if they ended up in other bands that were kind of cool that we know.  It's a good documentary, though.  You should see it.  Eh.  I'm telling you, it was good.  Yeah, Pearl Jam.  Because the whole Seattle scene, I'm telling you, and the whole grunge thing.  Yeah.  Eh, grunge.  Just laughing.  No desire.  You know what?  It's good.  Let's watch it in your theater.  I'll watch it again.  Oh.  In the theater.  Yeah. 
[00:13:00]  Where I watch certain movies.  Possibly.  With a nice sound system.  It'll be good.  Eddie Vedder's got a great voice.  You don't learn anything from them.  That's weird when you have a documentary and you don't learn anything about the mean guy.  You didn't really?  Nothing.  Well, it's more of a celebration of 20 years.  Oh, thank God.  Well, they had to do that because they realized, holy shit, Eddie Vedder's not going to talk  to us.  Did he not talk to the cameras or not?  No, he didn't.  No, he was on camera, but it was so, it was so nothing.  Not revealing?  No. 
[00:13:30]  He's shy.  He's a personal guy.  I don't even know if he's married.  I don't know if he has kids.  Yeah.  I don't know shit about Eddie Vedder.  He's married.  He's got kids.  And then he had this weird life where the guy raising him he thought was his father  and it wasn't his father, but it sounds like that guy was a complete asshole and his real  father was around, but no one really explained the whole story.  Do you know, Travis?  Yeah, well, his real father, he was always told that his real father was someone else  who he met a few times and then he found out that he was his father after, like three  years after he died.  Yeah. 
[00:14:00]  But it sounded like the guy that he thought was his father the whole time was a complete  fucking asshole.  Wow.  That's an odd situation.  That's kind of what I assumed.  Like Pauli Gautieri in The Sopranos where he found out his mother was not who he thought  it was.  Oh, right.  She was a nun.  Yeah.  There's nothing worse than an artist who won't be revealing.  How awful is that?  Yeah.  If he won't be.  It's a good job as a fucking.  Yeah.  Well, I don't think they were pressing him either.  I mean, Cameron Crowe did the documentary and he's really good friends with all of them, 
[00:14:30]  so it's not like he was looking to do this big expose.  Yeah.  But wouldn't that just be interesting to hear about?  Sure.  Like, not even to expose him, but just to let people know it.  Yeah.  I'd love to hear about that stuff.  Well, there's going to be, what, five hours?  Yeah, there's like five hours of bonus features on the Blu-ray, so who knows?  Maybe they do some stuff in there.  Yeah, well, you know that's going to be just shitty stuff.  Well, I know there's like a lot of concert footage and stuff, which.  I know people love extras.  I fucking hate extras on DVDs.  I hate them.  Do you like them, Matt?  Nah.  Some films.  Every once in a while, you get a good one. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Some of it is just so much shit that they, so they could just say there's so many hours.  Right.  They pack in hours of just drivel.  Yeah.  Crap.  You don't like bloopers?  Bloopers!  I don't mind a good blooper.  I just don't like, like, here's what's considered part of the hours.  It's like the storyboarding.  Oh, yeah.  And then, like, you're clicking through pictures of the storyboarding.  All of a sudden, you feel like you're watching an aha video.  Yeah, yeah, you know, you don't need that. 
[00:15:30]  That's just horrible.  What is this?  Yeah.  Or a lot of bands will put in, like, all their music videos.  Yeah.  Like, I don't know.  I'm not going to sit through that.  Well, Pearl Jam didn't like making those videos.  No, they sure didn't, but we already knew that.  Yeah, we did know that, Travis.  Me and you did know that.  Didn't like the videos?  Pearl Jam buddies.  Pearl Jam hated making videos.  They made one, I think, officially, for Jeremy, and that was it, right?  Well, they did a live, but they didn't really make it.  Well, those are, yeah, you can bring your cameras to the show if you want.  Why didn't they like making videos?  It was part of the special event. 
[00:16:00]  Because they were deeper than that, and the songs were deeper than that.  Oh, shut the fuck up.  No, they weren't.  They're not.  Oh, God.  God, enough of that shit.  Speaking of music, me and Ann, separately, but met up at the Radiohead show.  Yes, on the Thursday edition.  That was a great show.  I felt like I was.  That was pretty good.  I don't know what to think of Radiohead.  I like to tell people I'm a Radiohead fan, but I don't even know if I am.  You don't even know.  I really don't.  You just go there and listen and go, yeah, the guy's got a great voice. 
[00:16:30]  I like the Benz.  Talented band.  I like the Benz as an album.  Yeah.  From start to finish, I fucking love.  It's one of my favorite albums of all time, to be honest with you.  And then I like a song here or there from Radiohead.  Yeah.  So I don't know if I'm an uber fan or not.  I would say I'm not, but I found it was cool.  It was cool.  It sounded good.  Like I said, he's got a great fucking voice.  He's like a mad scientist up there.  Yeah, yeah.  He's up there fucking twitching and shaking, doing his wacky dances. 
[00:17:00]  I feel like he's doing some kind of experiment the whole time.  What is he doing up there?  And to be able to, you know, grab a guitar and then be fucking on the piano and shit  like that and be able to sing like that.  I just think he's a talented guy.  And I like when the people start asking me shit like, well, you know, he's like one of  the most liberal fucking things.  Why would I give a shit?  Yes.  First of all, he's not preaching it when he's fucking on stage.  He's just playing music.  Yeah, I don't really care which way they lean politically as long as they don't tell us. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, who gives a shit?  That's what I hate.  I'm a big U2 fan.  But when Bono gets up there, I'm like, oh my God, shut up.  Please don't do this.  What are you doing?  You don't think I don't like Sean Penn movies?  They're fucking good.  But when the guy opens his mouth when he's Sean Penn, he's a fucking tool.  But it's not going to stop me from seeing a, you know, a great performance by Mr. Penn.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I liked Radiohead.  I don't know where I'm at, though. 
[00:18:00]  I don't really understand a lot of this stuff.  If you guys are going to talk about Radiohead, can we please just mention how funny it was  that that Occupy Wall Street got completely hoaxed into thinking that Radiohead was coming  down to sing some songs for them?  But who started that?  Just some guy.  I heard it was some other band that was looking for attention or something.  I don't know if it was some other band because, I mean, their name certainly didn't get out  there.  But as far as I know, I read the email that was sent to them.  Yeah.  And it's just like, hi, I'm Radiohead's manager.  We would like to come down and play some songs for you. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  And they're like, yeah, Radiohead's coming.  But did they do that to try to get more people down there?  Because I know I started thinking, maybe I'll go down there and check out Radiohead.  And they did.  A lot of people ended up.  A lot of people showed up.  And they're like, it's amazing.  Our cause is growing.  And it's like, no, because people think they're going to see a free Radiohead show, you dumb  fucks.  Union Guys Wednesday.  Oh, yeah?  Union Guys Wednesday.  Is that it?  Just like the Marines?  We're going to show up to protect the Army and Marines.  Here's what I read yesterday. 
[00:19:00]  The Army and Marines are showing up to protect the protesters.  Man, it's like, from the police, I guess, and everything else.  It's like, really?  Do you know what it takes for the Army to step into a state and do something?  There are constitutional laws.  There's executive orders, martial law, things like that.  And do you think that's even going to happen?  That's how little these idiots know about anything that's going on in this country.  Just a bunch of fucking idiots. 
[00:19:30]  Have fun, I say.  I don't give a shit.  But, man, when they say the world is watching, yeah, and laughing their asses off at you.  You're just naive dummies.  What if the unions get involved?  Enjoy your youth.  I knew you liked Pearl Jam.  Oh, yeah, see?  The unions need to get involved how?  It's not for you!  Here's what causes get involved.  They go down there because they see there is, like, there's some media down there and some people.  So they're like, look, the pilots, actual airline pilots are joining us down here. 
[00:20:00]  It's like, no.  They were holding signs up with their own grievances.  It had nothing to do with Wall Street.  But maybe that's the place to go if you have a grievance.  It seems to be that's what the deal is.  So that's kind of cool.  Nah, it's stupid.  I'm watching this thing.  And then they're like, peaceful protesters are being arrested on the Brooklyn Bridge.  And dumb Michael Moore tweets, he goes, the Brooklyn Bridge is closed because protesters are being arrested. 
[00:20:30]  It's like, no.  Protesters are being arrested because they closed the Brooklyn Bridge.  They told them.  They warned them.  They took a bullhorn to the cops and said, look, clear out now.  Clear the street.  You won't be arrested.  Everything's cool.  But you can't fucking be on the road.  If you are, you will be arrested.  And then they start getting arrested.  It's like, we're peaceful protesters.  Get off the road.  People are trying to drive. 
[00:21:00]  But they're nice protesters because they decided to march across the Brooklyn Bridge on the weekend.  That's nice.  Oh, yeah.  That didn't affect anyone's commute.  Well, they're very busy during the week, sleeping in late, fucking, you know, going to school.  I don't know how I feel about them.  I'm starting to watch this thing.  Dummies.  Only because I agree with Anthony, they are dopes.  But the part is the people that they're protesting against, I have, like, I actually agree with what Roseanne said about them.  Like, even though I think she's a, you know, I don't agree with giving away your wealth, but she's talking about beheading bankers.  Yeah, yeah.  You wouldn't fucking get an argument out of me. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, believe me.  There's plenty of greed to go around in every industry.  But what they're also bitching about is the fact that the government, man, is so influenced by big business.  Then get your ass to Washington and protest the government, you dumb fucks, because you're protesting companies whose basic interest is money.  We know that.  This is no surprise.  These companies aren't.  Our prime directive is the good of mankind. 
[00:22:00]  Profits are, that's second.  We know what they're about.  We know what Wall Street's about.  That's why.  This isn't a surprise.  No one's hiding anything.  They're crooks.  They're trying to get money.  They're trying to make money.  That's their job.  Government's job is supposed to be representing the people, and they're fucking you over.  Can I get a union guy on the line here?  It's Craig on Long Island.  Craig, what union, brother?  I'm a local through a union member.  Oh, an electrician. 
[00:22:30]  Holla.  An electrician, yeah.  Yes.  Yeah, well, what they did, I mean, maybe you forget what they did five years ago, is, you know, the greed and everything.  You know, they took advantage of the whole system, and everyone keeps forgetting.  And now they're blaming the president of the United States for what has happened here.  Yeah, they, they...  People, people gotta, you know, step up to the police and say, hey, you know, this can't go on forever.  I mean, I was out of work for a long time, and, you know, I felt the brunt of the situation. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, through a recession, and...  This is a little bit more than a recession, I think.  Well, and the housing market, that came down because too many people believed the bullshit bankers  and took loans knowing that they couldn't pay the fucking things.  That was nice.  That was good.  But, of course, there's no self-accountability for that.  I was bamboozled.  What?  You know how much you bring in. 
[00:23:30]  They tell you how much you're putting out.  And just because some smooth talker goes, you could afford it, you start drooling at the mouth  and not listen to your own fucking mind and know you can't afford something?  Yeah, but that's what people do.  Yeah.  Yeah, well...  We've all done that.  Before I had money, I believed the credit card companies and all that shit.  That's a vulture mentality, by the way.  Like, who is the company?  Unfortunately, we all believe that, and they prey on us.  There's no self-accountability.  And that fucking lying lump of shit that got in the road. 
[00:24:00]  And they took my parents' house.  Bullshit.  What everyone wants to do now is not pay their mortgages and claim bankruptcy and run their  credit cards off and claim...  And let's just play the game.  Everybody should just play the game that they want to play.  Let me ask you...  Hold on.  Let me...  All right, all right, all right.  Let me ask you something.  They're out of the full pockets now.  Let me ask you something.  All right.  Before we had money, right?  Were you always paying your credit cards and all that, or were you playing the game? 
[00:24:30]  Minimum monthly balance was always paid.  I was paying my bills.  Always paid.  I did everything correctly.  I put 20% down on my house.  You asked him, okay?  I didn't do no interest-only loans or anything like that.  I played the right game, and I got fucked.  Okay, my house is worth shit now.  And now they have this modification where people say, oh, yeah, you can modify a home.  The banks, you know, the government had to step in and give these modifications, which 
[00:25:00]  the banks aren't even playing games with me.  You know what this is like, what you're saying, but like, Ann is kind of right, too.  He says about accountability, but there's also, they know more than we do.  It's almost like if you wire somebody's house as an electrician, and you do a terrible job  to save money, and that guy's house burns down, and then you go, well, fuck it.  You should have checked the electrical wiring before he left the house.  It's like the guy was going on a certain amount of faith that he wasn't going to be out-and-out  robbed by the guy doing his, it's almost like...  I can't even agree with that, because it's something totally different. 
[00:25:30]  It's a guy that is telling you, the basic gist when you buy a house is, here's what your  monthly mortgage payments are going to be.  Here's what your taxes are going to be.  Here's how much you make.  Figure it the fuck out.  It's the simplest math equation ever.  They teach that in the second fucking grade.  That's hard to do.  What comes in, what goes out.  It's easy.  It's self-accountability.  It's easy, because I make enough money to pay my mortgage in advance, but when I looked 
[00:26:00]  at, like, I signed the loan, I looked it over, but when I realized the amount of interest  they wanted from me in X amount of years, and like, what could happen with this, the interest  rates, like, I don't know how interest rates affect what my apartment's going to be worth.  Like, I don't know that shit.  You have to fucking, how do you not educate yourself when you're making one of the biggest  purchases you'll ever make in your life?  No.  People are stupid.  They're greedy.  They're selfish.  They want to live well beyond their fucking means.  But you do educate yourself to a certain degree, but it's hard, it's hard to just know things 
[00:26:30]  that I'm fucking, there's no way I'm ever going to know as much as the guy giving the  loan.  There's no way I'm ever going to know what could happen.  The way these guys took advantage, betting against mortgages that they were giving.  Oh yeah, that's the scumbag move.  Suckers, like, there's no way, no matter, I could never educate myself to know they were  going to do that and not be in that business.  Because they knew there were going to be saps that would fucking, yeah, they knew there  were going to be suckers and saps.  But to call saps, hold on, hold on.  Hey, Craig, how about you shut the fuck up for a minute? 
[00:27:00]  Hang up on the fucking guy.  Just hold on a minute.  Holy shit.  I don't think you've really got any more to add.  I don't disagree with Craig even, but no, I, I got some, you said they know there's  going to be saps or the way these guys, like the energy company, uh, Solyndra, whatever  they're called.  Yeah, yeah.  These fucking pieces of shit.  Uh, now they're all taking the fifth and they won't talk about the money that they got  paid.  No.  These fucking vultures, man. 
[00:27:30]  To me, all those hippies who are annoying, they're fucking babies.  I agree completely.  They don't nearly inspire the rage that these guys fucking, uh, declaring bankruptcy with  fucking 500 million of our money.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, like that to me are people that we should be taking out into the street.  And let's just say Roseanne, I think had a great idea as to how to handle them.  And there's also a lot of people that do do the math and figure it all out.  And then all of a sudden their work dries up or, you know, they lose their gig and all  I understand that. 
[00:28:00]  And they're, and then they're fucked.  That's, but that's happening to a lot of people that again is, you know, I actually got  one of those in my life.  I got one of those in my family.  You know, I got a, I got, I got a family, uh, that's in deep trouble because, you know,  his work got, um, changed up.  So it sucks.  This guy, Craig is a union guy and we got another union guy that wants to talk to Craig.  That's why I, I, I stayed with Craig.  We got George on Long Island and Craig is back.  George.  Go ahead, George.  Hey, listen, how ironic is it that this, hey, Craig, let me ask you something. 
[00:28:30]  How, how, uh, how greedy do you feel when you make 160 bucks an hour covering standby?  I mean, I'm, I'm, we're up with the cost of living.  This cost of living of New York is high.  They got to watch fucking light bulbs burn.  Hey, listen, I, I, I, I'm not a sellout.  Okay.  I have to, I have to make the right amount of money to live in this city.  How fucking greedy do you feel carrying 160 bucks an hour watching fucking light bulbs burn? 
[00:29:00]  It's a simple question.  Okay, how much, how, how do you feel when, when the MTA charges you $12 to go over a bridge and you make $12 an hour and you can't even go over that bridge to get to work?  How about that?  The worst way you could possibly argue your point is to point out somebody else's fuck ups.  It doesn't answer the question.  How greedy do you feel getting 160 bucks an hour watching light bulbs burn? 
[00:29:30]  Listen, I, I don't feel greedy at all.  I feel that I'm getting, I have to get paid.  Why do a lot of fucks in Wall Street feel guilty about making money then?  Oh, well, that's a whole nother level, man.  It's still a hundred and, a hundred and sixty fucking bucks an hour for watching light bulbs burn is a different, is a different animal?  You don't find that fucking absurd?  Well, we do big corporations and they commercial work, okay?  I understand our residents and regular people want to build their house. 
[00:30:00]  They can't pay that.  But if you're a Bank of America and you want to build a building in the city, you got to pay off.  You're making his point, Craig.  And then they have to pay their bills.  And then, see, that's why jobs go overseas, by the way, is because certain people make so much money that it's just not viable for the company to keep the jobs in America.  And because the Bank of America, even though they are vultures, it's not right to overcharge them any more than it's right to fucking charge the Pentagon $40 for a screw. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, but that's also disgusting.  Well, we're going with the cost of living here.  But $160 an hour, Craig.  The guy made a good point.  That's a lot of money.  We got another guy from Colorado.  Let's see if it's a little different.  Eric in Colorado, you're on with Craig from Long Island.  Yeah, George brought up a valid point there.  I'm watching a fucking commercial building being built down the street from where I live.  It's all the union guys building it.  And because of the union scale, it's 60% over budget before they even broke ground. 
[00:31:00]  The general came in, and they have terminated the contract.  But half the union guys, and thank God Colorado is not a union state, they brought in non-union workers and brought the budget down to where it's only going to come in 5% over budget.  Doesn't that sound better to have American workers in there doing a job, not breaking the company that's trying to build this? 
[00:31:30]  I think unions initially were a great idea.  In certain cases, they still are.  But when it came down to pure greed and making sure that their workers made so much money that they drove jobs overseas, that's despicable.  One of the biggest things that Teamsters always forget is two major trucking companies here in Colorado about 15 years ago were driven out of business because of union contracts where the guys were already getting paid more than they should have. 
[00:32:00]  And then they threatened to go on strike for more money, and both companies said, fuck you.  One, in the middle of the night, filed bankruptcy, closed up doors, put something like 4,000 guys out of work.  The union came back and said, oh, don't worry, we'll get you jobs, we'll get you jobs.  Never happened.  I've got two guys who work with me who are former union members who have said they will never go back to work for the Teamsters again. 
[00:32:30]  But we're making comfortable living now.  All right.  And that's good.  Fair points about the union.  And 160 to watch light bulbs burn is revolting.  You get that job.  That's pretty good.  But that said.  You know what?  It's not 160 at all.  All right, dude.  Why didn't you tell him that, dude?  You're telling me now.  I don't know.  You should have told him that.  You didn't even say anything.  You're telling me.  Eric just walked right over your face, and now you're going to talk.  He's gone.  You're not mentioning this until we're talking, and then you're jumping on us. 
[00:33:00]  Right.  What is it about our voices where you decide to start talking?  That guy union cuckolded you.  What the fuck?  I'm giving the guy time to speak.  It sounds like it's just me.  Yeah, but then we start talking, and you've got to talk over us.  Hey, listen.  I want to talk about the bridge.  You were talking about the bridge in the beginning.  The what?  The bridge.  Oh, yeah.  The bridge.  The Brooklyn Bridge.  How they shouldn't be on this bridge and making a stink.  I think we should be out there making a stink, and Wall Street. 
[00:33:30]  Well, we're individuals here.  I'm watching this thing bubble.  I'm just kind of watching.  Ant's furious.  I'm kind of just taking a peek at this thing right now.  I'm actually laughing at it, but how is it good?  First of all, I didn't know Wall Street went into Brooklyn.  That's kind of an odd thing.  But how is it a good thing, and how are the police scumbags for clearing out a roadway,  a bridge, where people weren't on the walkway.  They were in the fucking roadway on the Brooklyn Bridge. 
[00:34:00]  And how is that good?  And then I saw the people holding up signs that said, hey, the police should be joining us.  We're trying to help save your jobs.  It's like, really?  So the cops are supposed to just turn around, join the protesters, get fired, lose their pension.  They did that in Egypt.  Why not in America?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They did it in Egypt.  They turned a lot of people in Egypt.  When you protest, that's the only way to have people watch you or be on the front page of the people 
[00:34:30]  is when you do something like that.  Well, when you get pepper sprayed and then march down to the fucking one police plaza  and try to get people fired that have worked their whole life and trying to get a pension  and live out the rest of their life, you're trying to fuck them over because they're doing their job?  Is that really what these guys want to do?  Yeah, let's protest on a sidewalk where we're all gated in and nobody does nothing and nobody gives a shit.  And then nobody cares.  We're not in the paper. 
[00:35:00]  We want to be in the paper.  Yeah, but the second somebody gets maced, then the protest changes to let's stop police brutality.  You want to see fucking brutality?  I saw one picture.  It was a guy being arrested with a balloon.  It's like you can't have police brutality when there's balloons involved.  Well, some shit's got it.  I've got to get it to work now and make $160 now.  Watch those light bulbs.  Make sure they don't burn out there, sir.  Come on.  We're counting on you.  $160. 
[00:35:30]  We're counting on you, brother.  Roseanne said – all right, go.  He's out.  She said something I disagree with, too, but something I do agree with.  She said her solution for dealing with how the banks could repay the money that the U.S. government bailed them out with in 2008.  She said part of my platform is the guilty must be punished and that we no longer let our children see their guilty leaders getting away with murder.  And she said that she believes in a guillotine for the worst of the guilty.  She said I would allow guilty bankers to pay the ability to pay back anything over $100 million of personal wealth because I believe a maximum wage of $100 million, which I don't agree with. 
[00:36:00]  There should not be a maximum wage.  And if they are unable to live on that amount, she said they should be beheaded, which I think is very funny.  Beheadings.  I really do think we need a few of those.  American beheadings.  Not for people making the money, but for the ones who are taking government bailouts and then funneling that money into fucking executive bonuses.  I firmly believe the government should be allowed to lop their heads off.  And for some reason, God doesn't want me to hang up with Craig.  I hung up on you. 
[00:36:30]  Craig?  Yeah, I'm still here.  No, I hung up on you.  Hang yourself.  No.  I don't want to hang myself.  Let me try this again.  The phone won't hang up?  All right, there it is.  There we go.  Okay, good.  I know there's something on out there.  I don't know if I could pie Wall Street.  I really don't know, but I know people can't afford their shit anymore, man.  This fucking bridge thing drives me nuts on a daily basis.  The amount of money they want just to cross the goddamn Hudson River.  It's ridiculous.  How do you deal with it?  I don't know how people could afford this shit. 
[00:37:00]  I'm not in that world anymore.  Thank fucking God.  Yes, but I have enough cousins and brothers and sisters, and I see it's getting tougher  for these people to fucking have a life out there.  And isn't there something valid about protesting?  Like, I think how the Brooklyn Bridge is free, but they did just raise, I think they should  be in the Lincoln Tunnel.  I mean, $12 toll.  They're just constantly fucking people, and the people who are really making that kind  of money, I don't want to take more of their personal income, but they're fucking stealing  it.  They're just stealing it. 
[00:37:30]  It's like, what are you doing?  How much money does the MTA need before they're going to stop?  How much do they need?  Because they're just fucking raping people at this point.  Again, government officials and government agencies are the ones to go after.  And the true Wall Street criminals, obviously, you want to go after them, too.  But to just pin it on this vague Wall Street, and you should see the signs, you know, capitalism  must go, really?  Really?  Our whole basis of fucking finance? 
[00:38:00]  And more of that fucking Troy Davis cocksucker fucking signs.  It just, it makes your cause look stupid.  But don't let them distract you.  You're right.  They are fucking idiots.  And fuck Troy Davis.  And fuck, but they're not the, fuck, don't let the fringe idiots distract from the fucking  main issue, which is that these pieces of garbage just cannot stop fucking stealing money.  Well, you know what, don't let the fringe people, like when the Tea Party fucking protests and  you see a sign that somebody declares as racist, and that's the entire Tea Party protest? 
[00:38:30]  Right, that's sickening.  It's right.  It's terrible.  It's sickening.  And what they were protesting is the fact that they don't want to be taxed up the ass when  the government doesn't even know how to spend their fucking tax money.  That seems viable.  That seems like something that other protesters, even with this stupid Wall Street thing, could  get involved with.  But no, you know, it's more divisiveness and bullshit.  I just think they're very confused little young lads that don't really know how Wall Street 
[00:39:00]  works, and that everyone on Wall Street and everyone that's made a living and success for  themselves aren't evil people that need to be fucking, you know, hung up by their heels.  But the ones that are, the ones at the top that are, look, he didn't make it off.  The worst of the worst, and he goes into a fucking minimum security jail instead of being  somewhere, I mean, where he's just absolutely fucking beaten.  I mean, look, even his life is going to be okay for jail. 
[00:39:30]  He's worse than murderers, man.  He's fucking sold a billion dollars, man.  A billion dollars.  Yeah, there are people that, you know, steal a car and get time in real, you know.  Rikers or wherever, right?  Fuck up the ass prison.  And I don't, I'm not a fucking, you know, I don't hate Wall Street.  I've made an okay amount of money on Wall Street.  I invest and I believe in investing your money.  Yeah.  Breaking news, I fucking hate Wall Street.  What they did to me and that Citadel stock, man, I'll never forgive those fuckers.  That was Wall Street? 
[00:40:00]  Oh, that was Wall Street, all right.  That was Farid.  That was Wall Street, man.  So you can't just take a thing.  That was Wall Street.  Wall Street, man.  It was told to me it was a guarantee.  Get in on this.  That's just it.  And Wall Street fucking.  There are no guarantees.  They fucked me.  It's a gamble.  100 G's.  Like anything else.  Open that window and throw 100 G's out.  That's what happened to us.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  But the government, it changes.  Like, it's Obama and Bush.  I showed you it's the same thing.  So it doesn't really matter.  It doesn't matter if it's a liberal Democrat or a religious conservative.  That doesn't affect it that much. 
[00:40:30]  The government, they fucking, they change.  Holla.  That's where I'm at.  Look at Obama.  He just fucking, he was trying to put this alternative energy thing together.  He got fucked.  Like for all the, all the, the way people think like the protesters, these liberal protesters,  Obama got fucked too.  The same way as Bush did by these big business people.  They fucking took, what was it, a half a billion dollars or whatever is involved with that?  So he got it too.  It is amazing how, uh, Obama though is, uh, Teflon when it comes to, uh, sticking him  with, with this thing.  Yet, uh, when Bush was involved with, you know, oh, look, Halliburton got this contract and 
[00:41:00]  this kind of money and everything, uh, you know, he was the, the criminal and Obama's  just, I don't think he didn't know about it, but they, they just said they needed 500  fucking million dollars.  And I believe Obama wasn't in on it though.  I really, yeah.  White house meetings, things, but well, his, his, uh, his lackeys were in on it.  That's what I think.  I think people that he appointed, I think people that he trusted, uh, were in on it and more, 
[00:41:30]  more lack of leadership as I see it.  It's easier to see a guy like Bush and I don't hate Bush, but it's easier to see him being  in on it when his entire adult life for most of his life, he was dealing with those kinds  of people because he was in the oil business.  I mean, for a lot of his life, he was involved with that.  Whereas Obama, he didn't come from that.  No, he came from fucking being an organizer in Chicago, uh, where God only knows what he  did.  And, uh, he has a complete, he has a complete, uh, racist background. 
[00:42:00]  Hang in there.  Hang in there.  I am.  You're going to have a Republican in the, in the white house soon.  Hang in there.  Rick Perry's any better?  You're going to make it.  I want to be invited.  He has to put troops in Mexico.  I want to be invited to the, the nigger head, uh, uh, hunting camp.  So, so, you know, of course I would want to go there.  What's that about?  Cause that's a big headline today.  Rick Perry apparently has this, uh, little, uh, club, this little place he'd go to.  Right.  Uh, that is family owned.  Yeah. 
[00:42:30]  It's like a hunting lodge kind of a place.  What do you mean is family owned it?  Like how long?  It's been in the family a while?  His father was in, in the family for a while.  Sure.  So Perry was a kid when his father bought this place?  No, I think it was, I think it was when he was still in civilian life, but he wasn't  a kid at the time.  Okay, sir.  And, uh, there's a giant boulder in front of the place and I guess they named it, uh,  nigger head.  Why?  I guess a lot of places were called that back in the day.  Like, uh, some rivers were called like nigger head river or ravine. 
[00:43:00]  Like it was just something people called things back then.  But why?  Were they trying to be just racist?  No, it was back in the day where that wasn't a problem calling things that.  And now in the interim, there was a time when that wasn't a problem.  Yeah.  It was like, yeah.  And then you make a turn at a nigger head ravine and, uh, you know, and that was not  a problem for people.  No, it was fine.  The word didn't, you know, when did the word become a problem to black people?  Uh, when it became very powerful.  Look, see, there's nigger head, uh, tar soap that, uh, that, uh, Travis just 
[00:43:30]  brought up on the computer.  See those, it was just an accepted thing.  Uh, and then as, as the civil rights movement started moving ahead, um, that, that's when  people started saying, Hey, we got to change the name of some of this shit, which they  did now.  So, uh, do you think they were being nice when they were, when they were naming these  places?  No, I don't think they were being nice.  I think it was just part of the vernacular.  It was part of, uh, uh, words.  It was, it was what it was. 
[00:44:00]  But you watched the way these fucking, now this is, I don't think that he bought that  and went, Hey, nigger head, leave it there.  It's a non-issue.  It's a fucking post making a big deal about it.  Yeah.  But you watch the way these people all jump on it.  Already Kane is saying it's insensitive.  Oh yeah.  They're going to harp on it.  Well, he painted it over, but when did he paint it over?  He hasn't been there since 2006.  How this works.  He's fucked over this.  I don't even like him.  I think he's a douche.  How this works in the media.  He is fucked.  You think?  Because I think there's enough plausible deniability at this point.  We'll have to see what comes out in the future. 
[00:44:30]  No fucking way.  The story just broke.  I'm not saying he could be innocent and everything, but I'm telling you, it's just how they spin  the shit.  He's fucked over this one.  I will guarantee this.  You think?  Front page of the Washington Post?  Fuck yeah, dude.  Wow.  He's done because of this.  Yeah, we'll see.  It's not even newsworthy.  Who gives a fuck?  No, it's like, well, whatever.  He didn't write it.  But I saw some activists talking, and boy, are they just running with this one.  Of course.  They don't want him in there.  They don't want him even close to being in there. 
[00:45:00]  Well, then there's just a lot of dummies that, you know, as soon as the commercials  start and they start throwing that around, they're just going to buy into it.  He's fucked, man.  I'm telling you.  And he's probably completely innocent.  Yeah.  Well, I was heading up to Jignick, which I call my place.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm thinking of painting over the rock, though.  Yeah.  You got some big rocks in your yard, don't you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  AIDS Hollow.  That's a really nice retreat.  Yeah, so that's the big story with Perry. 
[00:45:30]  And I'm sure Reverend Al's scowl got even deeper.  Is there a Reverend Al?  The Washington Post story revealing that Texas Governor Rick Perry hunted and hosted lawmakers  at a hunting camp called Niggerhead is alarming and displays new heights in racial insensitivity 
[00:46:00]  in national politics.  Mr. Perry should immediately fully explain how he could have gone to a ranch and hunted that is named after such an obvious racist term.  Or he should withdraw from the race.  Like you did about the brawly lie, you fucking asshole.  He is either blindly insensitive or hopelessly unaware of where he spends his time. 
[00:46:30]  Either way, it makes one wonder if he is ready for prime time and certainly whether he is ready for the White House.  Reverend Al's scoffed.  And there you go.  Wouldn't you love for once one of these guys takes the opposite tact and say, you know what?  I doubt he knew.  Yeah.  Wouldn't you like for once one of these fucking cocksuckers to be unpredictable?  It's like how?  Yeah.  He's running for president.  I don't think he knew.  None of them are fucking unpredictable. 
[00:47:00]  Never.  No.  None of them give the unpredictable answer of like, yeah, you know what?  And watch.  Let's see how Cain handles this.  Let's see how Cain handles this because now he'll slam him a little bit.  He did.  And then let's see if he fucking goes, well, now he wants to run as his vice president.  Yeah, he's fucked over this.  Let's see if the black guy is willing to run for the vice president of the guy who had niggerhead on a rock.  You think they were hunting over there?  What kind of hunting do you think they were doing?  You think they were hunting?  No, I think they were hunting deer. 
[00:47:30]  Pheasant.  Each other's cocked with their mouths.  Fucking assholes.  You don't think they were hunting, you know?  No.  No, no.  That would be crazy.  How many years back does this go?  I don't know.  Probably a while.  That's what...  But you didn't give me a date.  I don't have one.  Does it go all the way back?  That's just it.  I don't have a date.  Does it go all the way back and it's just been sold over the years?  Yeah.  And made into the Prairie family?  Yeah, that's kind of it.  It's a possibility way back in the day they might have been hunting, you know. 
[00:48:00]  I doubt it.  I doubt it.  Let a few go?  Yeah.  I don't think they'd do that.  Let a few go and just go, okay?  Yeah.  Time for the hunt?  Boy.  I don't think so.  Perry's fucked over this, I'm telling you.  You think?  Even if...  And I think he is innocent of all charges, but...  We'll see where this goes.  Yeah, media just sucks.  We'll see if it's a story.  You know.  And you don't even get a chance to explain yourself before it's a fucking tidal wave of shit coming at you. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  You know the deal.  Oh, I know.  Yeah.  So then what happens?  Is Romney the main guy now for you?  And what about this Christie guy?  This fatso in Jersey?  Is he going to run or what?  What a wishy-washy he is.  He stinks.  Yeah, screw him.  He likes all the attention, but...  He's too fat.  Mm-hmm.  He likes the attention, but...  Taft was the last fat president.  Americans don't like it.  You're right.  You're absolutely right.  The big fucking fatso.  An overindulgent fatso. 
[00:49:00]  Nobody wants to look at that big fucking fatso.  Yeah.  Fatso.  Hey, get a little fatso over there.  You know what, dude?  You balance the budget.  You go to White House.  You know what, dude?  Boom.  You go to New Jersey.  Balance your calories.  Yeah, you know what?  You got your meta bars swearing in.  Yeah, you got your economy, dude.  You got your foreign press, dude.  You got...  All right.  But you treat yourself with an oatmeal cookie because it's oatmeal.  Yes, that did happen on the fly fishing weekend.  Did he really say that? 
[00:49:30]  Oh, yeah.  You treat yourself because it's oatmeal?  Oh, because he likes oatmeal.  No, he justified it.  He said it can't be bad because it's an oatmeal cookie.  Was he kidding?  No.  Oh, he's an ass.  It's on one of my videos.  I'm like, what are you doing?  Someone offered an oatmeal cookie.  He's like, it's oatmeal.  It's good for you.  It's oatmeal day.  Fucking Bobby Rolls.  It's good for you.  It's all natural.  I don't know, man.  I think something's happening out there because we get more and more people that want to talk  about this shit than ever before, Ant.  That's because I've just been railing on it. 
[00:50:00]  Maybe the Occupy Wall Street, you know, maybe, I don't know, maybe they don't know what the  fuck they're doing down there, but there's something bubbling in this fucking country.  It does show a fed-up-ness, I think, with that.  I mean, how else do you show how fed up we are with this fucking people taking these hundred  million dollar golden parachutes with government money that's our money?  Like, how do you deal with that?  Well, it would be nice if somebody actually could articulate that.  In an interview, that would be nice.  But maybe this organizes into something real, maybe. 
[00:50:30]  No one wants to hitch their wagon to these idiots.  But how does this end?  How does it end?  It ends by, what was the temperature today?  51 when I left the house?  It was a little chilly.  The first real cold day, that's when it ends.  Because these little fucking wimpy assholes are going to run home to Mommy's house with  a nice little blankie and they could turn the heat up.  They should have started in spring.  Yeah.  So their timing sucks. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, I felt like not leaving the house today.  Oh, believe me.  And I got a cush gig.  I walked out with short-sleeved shirts and I was on a short-sleeved shirt.  I'm like, you know what?  I'm going to go home.  I was pissed.  They don't even know we're here anymore.  No.  This company doesn't even know we're here anymore.  We could have taken today off.  No one would have known except the listeners.  And, of course, they would have tweeted us about it all fucking day.  But besides you people, no one else would know.  And I gave the worst comment to my door guy on the way out.  I really am a suburban asshole.  Oh, no.  What did you do?  I got away for a couple days.  What happens?  Winter comes.  You didn't say that. 
[00:51:30]  I did.  A cab should have run me over and killed me.  But I bet you the doorman appreciated that.  Oh, dude.  He was like, hey, you know what?  It rained.  We had a pleasant moment.  That's what you do.  You just talk about the weather with me?  Because that's his life.  Not important enough.  What's that?  Doorman.  That's his life, though.  That's Seinfeld shit.  I love it.  That's his life, though.  22nd conversations with people that live in the building.  So that's his world.  I know.  You play perfectly into his world.  But at least with me, he was talking to a celebrity.  That's true.  That's true.  My doorman offers me bootleg movies every fucking time I see him. 
[00:52:00]  I'm like, I don't need your bootleg movies.  He goes, this one's not bad.  You know, there's a guy that walks through the camera a couple times.  But besides that, it's pretty good quality.  I'm like, I don't need your bootleg movies.  Here's what you should say to him.  You should one day just quietly go, look, stop trying to bond with me.  Right.  And then point to his hat and his shoes and say, see what you do?  And this is what I do.  And then point to the luxury.  He kind of wants some kind of, yeah.  He wants to be friends with you.  Yeah.  He wants to be your go-to guy.  But when you say the audio's pretty good, I'm like, no, I don't need some fucking, you 
[00:52:30]  know, camcorder movie.  I went to the movies over the weekend.  No, you didn't.  I saw, yeah, yeah, I did.  I saw that Apollo 18.  Did you get to drive?  That Blair Witch Project on the moon.  Yeah.  Pretty much what it is.  We didn't hear much about it.  So I guess that movie was a dud-a-roo.  It was a dud-a-roo in the box office.  Um, yeah, it's, uh, it's, uh, eh, it was like, eh, it was more the, uh, the, uh, movie 
[00:53:00]  itself.  I kind of liked it, you know.  The concept was cool, right?  It looked pretty good, too.  Like, I'm surprised a lot more, um, uh, moon landing conspiracists haven't gone, see?  It could be done.  That looks like the fucking footage from the moon.  Right.  It's like, oh, yeah, because it's 2011, you dummy.  And we have 22% on Rotten Tomatoes, 34% with the, uh, with the, uh, audience.  And, uh.  Wow, no one even came in to promote that on our show, huh? 
[00:53:30]  Were we offered the Apollo 18 guys?  No, they were like nobodies.  Really?  Yeah, they were just, you know.  It's kind of, eh, whatever, it's whatever it is.  All right, look, the rocks are alive.  All right, look.  The what is?  I just wrecked it for everybody.  The who?  But who cares?  See, there, there, there is some kind of life on the moon.  Oh, and it's the rock?  The rocks.  That's what they don't run around going like they're rocky or something?  Yes.  The rocks are alive. 
[00:54:00]  That's weird.  Yeah, that's the fucked up part.  That's a little too weird to deal with.  Yeah.  No?  It is weird.  They're like rock monsters?  No, they're not like rock monsters.  The actual, you don't know what kind of life form they are, but they're just the little  rocks.  Yeah.  They move around.  That's stupid.  Ew.  Yeah, yeah.  Who the fuck wants to watch rocks running?  Rock feet?  Right.  No, they don't have feet.  They just kind of, sometimes they do, though.  Little things happen.  Little things out of the corner of your eye.  But shouldn't it be more of like a snake type of thing would be cool on the moon?  Nah, it's just rocks.  That's dumb. 
[00:54:30]  Because that's just it.  We would have seen something like that.  So how do they attack you?  They roll on you?  They smash through your fucking front of your thing.  They get in your suit, and then they go in you.  They burrow inside you.  That's stupid.  Yeah.  You can avoid rocks.  That rocks are alive.  Look out.  That's dumb.  It really is dumb.  Yeah.  And then the whole thing where the Soviets were there.  We didn't know that, but the Soviets had landed on the moon.  Just rocks that throw themselves at you?  That's horrendous.  The moon is a rock. 
[00:55:00]  Why does it just crush you when you get there?  Why would it be in the moon?  Do they call it sand up there?  The moon sand.  Why would it be something that's sort of burrowed in there that you never really see?  A moon sand monster.  And then let them throw the rocks.  Let the stupid thing that's living in the moon sand throw the rocks.  I don't know, because I think the whole gist is that the moon is so barren, and so nothing  that we know as a life form could live there, that the whole thing that the rocks  themselves are the life form would make sense, because it's like, you wouldn't expect it. 
[00:55:30]  It's something completely different than any life form.  We know there wouldn't be some snake living on the moon.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So why aren't our rocks alive on Earth?  Well, because we have an atmosphere and stuff that is conducive to life as we know it.  So then the rocks would thrive down here.  No, no.  The rocks can't fucking live here.  With proper nutrition and oxygen.  No, no.  The rocks don't need oxygen.  That's stupid, though.  They need...  We kind of look at the moon like, oh, that's sort of similar to some of the shit we got  down here.  Nah.  We can't have the rocks on the moon fucking alive. 
[00:56:00]  I'm sorry.  Nah, it's because there's a vacuum of space.  It's cold.  It's fucking...  Why not show the moon sand kind of moving?  Like...  Well, they did.  They showed little tracks.  That'd be cool.  They showed little tracks and go, these aren't human tracks.  It almost looked like a snake trail, but it turned out to be where the rocks kind of skidded.  Oh, that fucking...  That's the worst thing I've ever heard.  Did you roll your eyes at it?  You had to.  Yeah.  That's a dumb concept.  We're running rocks.  The movie was awful.  And how do they propel themselves where they could smash into the astronauts?  I don't know. 
[00:56:30]  They kind of fucking jump.  How?  They're like Mexican jumping being rocks.  They have tiny little rock legs?  Yeah, little rock legs.  With knees that are strong?  Occasionally, they do change form a little bit.  Into what?  To have, like, rock legs, I think.  Because they could crawl around on your face.  One got in the guy's helmet.  Why wouldn't it?  He was crawling around on his face and shit.  Why couldn't it have been some kind of weird organism?  Because, like I said...  Think like Cloverfield.  No, organisms can't live on the moon.  But that's...  Well, rocks can't either.  So if they're going to go crazy...  But they can on the moon, that's just it.  Why not have something that doesn't need oxygen? 
[00:57:00]  And if Hollywood says this can live on the moon, we're just going to accept it because  it's stupid Hollywood and a dumb movie.  Why do they have to be accurate with their horseshit?  Was Mickey there going, he'll knock you to tomorrow, rock!  Rock!  You can't do this, rock!  The rock says, I'm gonna smash through your helmet!  And you always do the machos coming because you hear...  Ba-ba-ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Oh no!  Rock-y!  What about the rocks we brought back from the moon? 
[00:57:30]  Where are those rocks?  Exactly.  That was supposed to be the sequel?  That's kind of the little postscript.  They were like, and by the way, a shitload of rocks were brought back.  Some of them were shipped to other places.  How about, by the way, we're never going to be able to make another movie because this  is a stinkeroo.  Yeah.  That should have been the tagline.  30 years, they just sit in the fucking...  So what do these rocks do?  They just let themselves become rock slaves and they don't do anything for 30 years?  They're like fucking...  They're human cuckolds.  They don't fucking fight back? 
[00:58:00]  Rocks are very patient.  They've been around for a long time.  If they're alive, what do they eat to survive?  Who knows?  Maybe they eat the dust from the moon.  Well, that's...  They don't know.  You're talking about organisms as we know them.  Are they mad that their fucking human counterparts are having Jim plus Jane written on them  with a heart?  Are they humiliated for that?  Or niggerhead Lodge.  They're very angry.  Yeah.  That's what got the rocks all fucking riled up on the moon.  They finally said enough already.  Yeah, enough already.  This is embarrassing.  Yeah, really.  I want to get lumped in with those racists. 
[00:58:30]  Yes, indeed.  I hate this movie.  It's terrible.  I can't even scythe.  Sounds terrible.  Apollo 18 meets 17 and a half mil.  Well, you know, and it looked pretty cheap.  Only cost five million.  Very small set.  Jeff, microphone.  Can't hear you.  Very small sets.  Very small.  Yeah, it only cost five million to make.  And it made 17 and a half million bucks.  So I guess it did okay for themselves.  Well, I liked the, I don't know, it was very claustrophobic feeling, sort of, you know, Blair Witchy kind of handheld camera thing. 
[00:59:00]  Could it have been better?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  By not making it rocks.  Yeah, exactly.  By making it a giant budget movie called Apollo 13.  Ah, come on.  Rocks are alive.  That's, uh...  Yeah, the rocks.  There might be a little something in the rocks.  Something going on.  That might be, you know, I don't know.  Let me say hi to John, North Carolina.  Hey, Shane.  Good morning.  Ant, I gotta call you out on your movie reviewing. 
[00:59:30]  I got sucked into watching Bridesmaids, and my wife even looked at me and said, this is a shitty movie.  You know what?  Yeah.  Can I start, Ant?  Yeah.  Just so people know, I saw Bridesmaids, and I hated it.  Except for that fat broad who was on SNL this weekend, and they're showing clips all over the place because I guess she killed it on SNL.  And then Ant saw it and said, you know what?  You're, you're, I don't agree with your movie review.  I kind of like the movie.  And now I'm starting to go back and watch, like, um, specific scenes, and I'm like, you know what?  Maybe I gotta watch this fucking movie again. 
[01:00:00]  Look, I, and I didn't sit there crowing about it like some fruit.  I said it wasn't as bad as I thought it was gonna be.  Yeah, because I killed it after I saw it.  And it had some funny moments.  That's it.  There's a, there's a deleted scene, there's a deleted scene going around on the internet right now, because I guess it's part of the Blu-ray.  It's the, uh, it's the confrontation, uh, Wig there.  What's her first name?  Kristen Wig?  Yeah.  Has with the little cute girl in the store?  Yeah, yeah.  The sales girl at the store. 
[01:00:30]  And in the movie, I think it was maybe a two-minute scene, and there's, it's literally over ten minutes on the internet.  Yeah.  Unedited.  And it fucking made me howl.  So now I'm like, fuck, maybe this movie was all right.  Maybe they should have made a ten-minute movie.  Ha ha, yeah.  What didn't you like about it?  It, there was absolutely nothing funny about it.  There was like one or two scenes that were funny, and we're watching this movie.  And my wife even looks at me, and she goes, why was this movie so funny? 
[01:01:00]  And I'm watching it for her.  You didn't like the fat broad?  She tried way too hard.  The movie tried.  Wow, I didn't think she tried hard at all.  I thought she was effortless with her shit.  90% on Rotten Tomatoes, 80% audience.  Yeah.  They liked it.  I don't give a shit, that movie.  Ha ha, nice.  You know.  Cup of tea.  That chick is so fucking hot, by the way.  Yeah, the little girl there.  Jesus Christ.  Little girl?  What are you talking about?  You make us sound fucking ten.  Yay!  She can't be more than, what, 17 there, right?  Yeah, something like that. 
[01:01:30]  Who knows?  Maybe.  Maybe 17.  Oh, maybe.  Maybe.  At one point.  No.  It doesn't have to be now.  No.  I want a kiss.  How old is she?  I had a very weird dream last night.  No way.  That I'd like to discuss.  Oh.  It doesn't have to be right now.  Could we do it right after the break?  Absolutely.  Because that's a great tease.  It's so weird, I actually woke up and wrote down notes.  Wait, is that typed?  Yes, I actually went to my computer half asleep.  It threw me for such a weird loop.  Wow, that's pretty cool.  I was in such a weird loop from this fucking weird dream. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  I just put highlights there.  Oh, I can't wait to hear about your dream.  We'll do that next.  Also, she's only 15 in.  Yeah.  Well, she's got to be 16 now.  She's still 15.  Wow.  Jesus.  See, that proves...  She looks older than 15.  That proves a point I made a while back where my cutoff point was.  That's the type of cutoff point age I was talking about.  That girl.  That type of girl. 
[01:02:30]  I love you.  How haven't you been arrested yet?  I'm just amazed by this.  Because I haven't done anything.  I'm a good boy.  But you could look at that and go like, okay.  But what guy in his right mind doesn't look at that and think, that's completely fuckable.  You're a good boy, but you're foaming at the mouth constantly.  Yeah, you know.  She has a big forehead, though.  Like that one picture of the second row in the middle.  Look at that giant fat head.  Look at that right there.  Well, she's made up to look older.  She has a giant skull.  I would bet money that picture, she's not 15 in there. 
[01:03:00]  What?  But the one...  Look at that.  She doesn't look 15 there.  Her forehead is atrocious.  She looks like she's in her early 20s there.  Maybe she needs some bangs.  A tiny mouth.  Yeah, you know what?  She's creepy.  She has a tiny mouth and a big forehead.  And tiny eyes.  You're right.  Big fat head.  You're right.  Jesus Christ, Jimmy.  Fuck that giant head.  And her pussy's way too tight.  Yeah.  What?  And her head is too...  It's almost like she has...  Someone drew a giant circle and just threw features into the middle of it.  It's like, how do you spread this out a little bit?  There's fucking a lot of forehead room there. 
[01:03:30]  They did spread everything out.  They pushed everything toward the fucking sides.  There's nothing wrong with that.  There's nothing wrong with that.  If you like giant...  If you like a forehead, you can fucking ride a dirt bike across.  There's nothing wrong with that.  That's a big forehead.  She's way...  That's why she was wearing that stupid hat and bridesmaid.  Oh, the giant forehead.  Of course.  Somebody knew that she looked way better without all that forehead showing.  Now it makes sense.  Because the hat was like, why is she wearing that goofy...  She's wearing like kind of an almost beret kind of...  Right, right.  Knitted beret hat.  She's wearing the thing that they drive in pitchers in Shea Stadium. 
[01:04:00]  It's a Mets hat cart.  Fucking Mets.  I fucking hate the Mets.  Fuck the Mets.  Stupid Mets.  And now the Jets.  Stupid Jets.  Fucking hate the Jets.  Stupid Jets.  Hockey starts soon.  Thursday.  Yep.  E-Rock is in my dream.  Really?  Yes.  What else is in your dream?  Give us a couple teases here, Jimmy.  After the break, Jimmy talks about his dream.  And I didn't forget.  Everyone else did.  But Jocktober starts tough fucking day. 
[01:04:30]  Yes.  I have a very...  There are presidents involved.  There's a very brief...  Do I have a cameo?  You do.  Nice.  Is it good?  Is it a good cameo?  It's a reference point.  Not bad.  Opie's in it.  I mean, E-Rock is in it.  Yeah.  E-Rock is in it a lot.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  I want to ask E-Rock about what's going on in...  Where was it?  Denmark or something?  Why?  Where's the fat tax?  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  Good for Denmark. 
[01:05:00]  Is it Denmark?  I don't know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We'll get into that, too.  We got lots to do.  Jocktober.  Is Sam here, even?  Yeah.  Oh, he's been working on Jocktober?  Yeah, he was...  That's why I'm sitting in here.  I was hoping he wasn't.  I was hoping he had news.  Nah, Sam was killed.  Jesus.  In a backhoe accident.  Some weird accident that he shouldn't be killed in.  At least make it easier for us to fucking digest, right?  Yeah.  It's such a goofy death.  You're like, oh, well, yeah, Jesus.  He died doing what he loved.  Planting tomatoes. 
[01:05:30]  The Virus.  Sirius XM.  Hi, this is Chubby Checker.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Stay right there with a crazy bunch of guys.  Watch for the changes and try to keep up.  Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up.  I want to...  But now, but now you got to pick it up, you got to pick it up fast.  Okay, let's see, let's see.  Here we go.  All right, let's see. 
[01:06:00]  Chubby's getting up.  Come on, baby.  Let's do the twist.  Come on, baby. 
[01:06:30]  Let's do the twist.  Take me by my little head.  And go like this.  Come on and twist.  Yeah, baby, twist.  Oh, yeah.  Just like this.  Come on, little miss.  And do the twist.  My daddy is sleeping. 
[01:07:00]  And a mama ain't around.  Yeah, daddy's just sleeping.  And a mama ain't around.  Gonna twist it, twist it, twist it.  To each other, how's it done?  Come on and twist.  Yeah, baby, twist.  Oh, yeah.  Just like this.  Come on, little miss.  And do the twist. 
[01:07:30]  Work it for me.  Work it for me, baby.  Work it for me. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, you should see my little sis.  You should see my little sis.  She really knows how to run.  She knows how to twist.  Come on and twist.  Yeah, baby, twist.  Just like this. 
[01:08:30]  Come on, little miss.  And do the twist.  Come on.  Yeah.  That's all right.  Yeah.  Twist or not.  Twist.  Twist.  Twist.  Wow.  There it is. 
[01:09:00]  Chow to me.  Chow to me.  That is a legendary performance.  Wow.  Chubby Chipper.  With sabra-cadabra.  When are you going to see anything like that?  Chubby, Chubby, Chubby, Chubby, Chubby, Chubby.  I love Chubby.  This is amazing.  Chubby Checker backed up by Sabra Cadabra.  Sirius, Sirius XM, the virus.  The O.P. Anthony Show. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah, Chubby Checker, happy birthday.  That's why we play that shit today.  And what was it?  But Sabra Cadabra, which is a Sabbath song that they named their band after.  They came in, and they were doing their Black Sabbath thing,  and then Chubby Checker showed up, and fuck, they played together.  That was cool.  Yeah, it was fun watching Chubby teach them how to play the twist.  Like, no, just to watch him work with these musicians was kind of fun.  But those guys got it right away.  They were great, yeah.  As you could hear for yourself. 
[01:10:00]  And I fucking got that done.  Yes, you did.  Those stupid Chubby Checkers people were like,  he don't play the twist unless he's getting $20,000.  What was it?  $10,000.  $10,000 every time he plays it.  But they were handing me a disc of a new song.  I'm like, well, then I guess we don't play the new song now, do we?  Then he started twisting his ass off.  He twisted his fucking fat ass off right in front of us.  Nah, Chubby was cool.  Come on, baby!  You're pointing to his wig after asking if it's his real hair.  It was so embarrassing.  Oh, God, that's right. 
[01:10:30]  What happened?  What happened?  He's twisting and his hair is staying in one spot.  He's just twisting under his wig.  With a horrible hair like that, I'm surprised he's twisting at all.  That fucking thing's going to fly off like a helicopter.  Terrible.  Right.  I didn't call him Fats Domino.  Yeah, you did.  You asked how his house was doing after Katrina.  And he said, no, that's Fats Domino.  Oh, that's the other guy.  Chubby Checker, Fats Domino.  We get it.  Yeah. 
[01:11:00]  Blueberry Hill, right?  Or something like that.  Yeah, one of those.  See, I know Fats Domino.  So we've got to talk about Jimmy's dream.  We've got Jocktober about to start.  And we've got some guy that's claiming to be the uncle of Mia Frampton, the chick from Bridesmaids.  Who, by the way, is Peter Frampton's daughter.  Yeah.  Should we talk to this guy for a second?  Yeah, let's see what he's all about.  Sure.  Matt.  Hey, what's up?  That means your name is Frampton.  No, it's Burst.  Tina's married to my wife's mom. 
[01:11:30]  Tina?  I thought it was Mia.  What?  Mia's the daughter.  Yeah.  So what happened?  Who's who?  Tina is Mia's mother.  She was married to Peter.  So that's your sister?  No, it's my aunt.  Who are you then?  I'm married to my wife, who is related to Mia's mom.  All right.  So there you go.  It's my cousin.  Yeah.  So you're cousins with Mia? 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  Gotcha.  Yeah.  You ever see her?  I see her like maybe probably four or five times a year.  She moved out to L.A. because they wanted to give her a shot at acting.  And then because they moved back to Cincinnati to be closer to the family.  And then she all hot.  Yeah.  Where does Peter Frampton live?  Yeah.  Who gives a fuck about Mia?  Peter Frampton, man.  He lives in Cincinnati.  True.  Is he in Ohio? 
[01:12:30]  Wow.  He lives in Cincinnati?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He moved back because.  What happened to that Frampton comes alive money?  Well, he's got a really nice house in Cincinnati.  Goes a lot further in Cincinnati.  Yeah.  I would imagine.  Yeah.  I would think.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a pretty elaborate house.  I hear Cincinnati's all right, actually.  There's one there.  It's not bad.  I don't know anything about it.  You ever have Mia and her friends over for a pool party?  No.  No.  I haven't.  That sucks.  I was hoping to hear about that.  Who even knows if they play pool, right, Ant? 
[01:13:00]  Oh, Chip.  Chippa.  Sure didn't miss Chip.  That's funny.  She stayed in Tampa.  Chip was like, no, I didn't go there.  I was here.  Oh.  Wow.  What else, dude?  You know, this is your claim of fame, so enjoy it.  What else can you tell us?  No, I mean, you know, he's a pretty cool guy.  I know sometimes you guys, you know, rip on him and make fun of him.  But, um...  Who, Frampton?  Frampton?  Frampton, never.  He had the greatest live album ever. 
[01:13:30]  What are you talking about?  Jimmy doesn't like him.  I just don't like him because Kiss Alive is a better album and nobody gives that the credit.  Do you feel like I do?  Well, we do.  Do you feel like...  We do or I do.  I do.  I do.  Womp, womp, womp, womp, womp.  Ooh, baby, I love your way.  That's a good song.  Every day.  Didn't Frampton Comes Alive come out at the same time Kiss put out all their separate albums, too?  I don't know, actually.  What year was that? 
[01:14:00]  Because Kiss' separate albums, I want to say, was 78.  I think 75 or 76 was Frampton Comes Alive.  No, no, no.  That was...  Kiss Alive was 75.  Kiss Destroyer was 76.  And I want to say Rock and Roll Over was 77.  Yeah.  But fucking...  So when did Frampton Comes Alive come out?  76, I'm going to say.  76.  76 was that year that Boston's first album came out, I believe.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And Frampton Comes Alive was out.  That was 76, Boston.  I thought it was 79.  No.  Ooh.  Give me Boston's first album.  It's not 76.  I'll bet money it was 76.  I'll bet you Kiss. 
[01:14:30]  We both win that way.  No, it's 76.  God, I know it's the same year.  76 was a big year for music.  Frampton Comes Alive is the same fucking year.  That's Boston, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, I know that.  Boston's big fucking...  God damn it.  Yeah, that was a big, big year.  Those are the only two albums you needed back then.  Yeah.  As long as you had those two.  I think there was another one, too.  Really?  Yeah, man.  I feel like there was another huge album that came out in 76.  Anyone that knows more about music than me, please let me know. 
[01:15:00]  Hey, Matt, thanks, I guess.  I don't know what else to tell you.  Hey, no problem.  No problem.  Take care, man.  Be good.  Are you allowed at Peter's house, or was it a messy divorce?  No.  It was pretty amicable.  You haven't been to Peter Frampton's house.  Too bad.  Yeah.  I mean, I go over there once in a while.  You drive past it every once in a while, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, tell me, Ant says hi.  Bohemian Rhapsody, Queen.  I knew it! 
[01:15:30]  That was a biggie.  That was a huge one.  That was a biggie.  Abba dancing, Queen.  That's a big year for music, man.  Were you a Queen fan growing up, Ant?  No.  I wasn't either, really.  Bohemian Rhapsody, when that song hit, though, was like, holy shit, this song's pretty fucking...  That was a biggie.  Fucking cool, but...  I know a lot of people love that Freddie Mercury and Queen, but I never got into him.  I was a Starland vocal band guy myself.  Yeah.  I just watched a very cool video of a Freddie Mercury tribute, and Axl was... 
[01:16:00]  Because I'm watching Gun Stuff, just reading Duff's book, and it was fucking...  Axl was doing a cover of We Will Rock You.  It's a massive stadium show.  I don't know where it was.  It was fucking great.  Look, Queen had some good songs, I'm not going to lie.  Probably Wembley.  Maybe.  I bet it was Wembley Stadium.  We Will Rock You's a great song.  You forget how good Axl was, like, that's why I was watching it, to hear his voice.  It's just sickening how fucking well that guy sang.  Yeah.  Ugh.  I don't think I'm going out on a limb by saying Axl was a good singer.  Freddie Mercury tribute.  For Bud Light, snap inside the car.  All right.  That's a commercial.  Yeah.  For Bud Light. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, god damn it.  Know what album I was looking for, and this guy Al on the line is absolutely fucking right.  Fucking Hotel California came out in 76.  Oh, shit.  The Eagles.  Fuck yeah.  It was a massive year for music.  Giant.  Al, that was 76, huh?  Yeah, I think so, man.  That one and Steve Miller, Book of Dreams.  Those were the four albums everybody had, or cassettes, eight tracks.  Steve Miller, though, that was a little in the distance. 
[01:17:00]  Let's be honest with each other.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Come on.  I was going to stay at Hotel California, but Kenny said, they don't have feather pillows.  So we didn't.  Could check out any time you like, but you can never leave.  I don't recommend it.  Thanks, Al.  All right.  All right.  Uh-huh.  We got Axl.  It's not Queen without Freddie Mercury.  This is 92?  Yeah, I'm not buying into Queen without Freddie Mercury ever.  Who's the lead singer of this, quote, Queen band now? 
[01:17:30]  I don't know.  Obviously, Axl's singing here, but.  Yeah.  92, oh.  That's a lot of fucking people, man.  Fucking massive show.  Oh, Jesus.  Jesus. 
[01:18:00]  I just keep thinking Eastside Dave.  Like doing this.  I can imagine him just yelling.  You think Axl has a hard cock right now?  Having all those people just cheering along with him like that.  Does it make you instantly hard, you think, if you're in front of that many people?  I don't know.  How long did he make him wait?  He can fucking belt out of tune, though, man.  That is a lot of people.  That's crazy.  Nice shorts, Axl.  Jesus.  Oh, it's 92.  And it was a tribute to Freddie. 
[01:18:30]  The back is cut out of him.  Yeah, you gotta have a helmet imprint in your fucking shorts.  Nice.  And another album in 76.  Oh?  Was Hotel California, I want to say it was 75.  I'm obsessing with.  Really?  I don't feel like Hotel California was 76.  For some reason, that feels like 75.  Yeah, 76.  December of 76.  December of 76.  December?  So almost 77. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  Just snuck it in.  So I was way off.  December 8th.  Dave in Levittown.  Dave?  Yo, hey.  Leonard Skinner, one from the road.  70-fucking-6, eh?  Oh.  What was on that one?  Skinner.  What was on that one?  Yeah.  I love Leonard Skinner.  That was a massive party.  Is that what Sweet Home Alabama's on, or?  Yeah, that was another one you can clean your shades on.  What?  It opened up and you can clean your shades on it, you know?  You wear it out.  I fucking love him.  How the fuck did you buy all these albums back in 76? 
[01:19:30]  Oh, man.  I know.  You gotta trade some of this.  Save up your pennies and go to the record store.  And there was no zipping around.  It was take off the old record, put on the new record.  Take off the old record, put on the new record.  Yeah, you do the Columbia House thing where you get 10 of them for a penny and then fuck  them.  All right.  I'm going on a record.  1976, the biggest year in rock music ever.  Because now there's another one coming in.  What?  Fucking Rumors by Fleetwood Mac.  There you go.  All right.  Well, if you're into that kind of thing.  That was a fucking perfect album. 
[01:20:00]  Good job, boys.  Have a great day.  I love you.  Thank you, buddy.  All right.  Bob Seger, it was big.  Well, give me that.  That night move fucking.  That was 76?  That wasn't?  I'm not sure.  Fleetwood Mac, 76, Rumors.  Let me go to Jason in Texas.  Jason?  Good morning, boys.  All right.  Talk about 76.  Seger was 76.  When I moved, Tom Petty's first album came out that year. 
[01:20:30]  Tom Petty.  He didn't make any noise until the 80s.  But Kiss had a massive album, too.  Kiss Destroyer with Detroit Rock City.  76.  It was a fucking huge album.  Yeah.  And Beth was on that.  That was their biggest album.  Okay.  Beth was on that one.  Was there a better year than 1976 as far as rock music goes?  Can't forget Bosque still degrees.  All right, Bosque.  Let's relax with Rush 2112.  That's a big album, I guess.  Not as big as other Rush albums. 
[01:21:00]  What Sabbath album came out?  I want to say, I think Sabbath boy, Sabbath was 75.  Technical Lexity, I think, was 76.  Now, people are pushing this a little bit.  I mean, when you talk Rumors, Skinner, Hotel California.  Huge.  Frampton Comes Alive.  Frampton Comes Alive.  Boston.  Now, people are like, oh, Genesis, Trick of the Tale.  Get the fuck out of here.  Shut up.  Genesis.  I was into Genesis back in the day.  Enough out of you.  People weren't running out to get Trick of the Tale by Genesis.  No.  Like there were Rumors and the rest of these albums that were mentioned. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  Those are the biggies.  I think that's got to be the biggest year ever in rock music.  Has to be.  Yeah, it's a huge one.  For album, especially album rock, you weren't just buying singles.  You might not have liked Fleetwood Mac Rumors, but that thing was fucking ridiculously big.  Huge album.  Sold a couple of records.  When did Dark Side of the Moon come out?  Seventy...  Yeah.  I think that was before 76.  Oh, my God.  Is that...  I'm getting communicated here.  Rolling Stones, Black and Blue.  Why don't you use the Wikipedia albums in 1976? 
[01:22:00]  What was on Black and Blue, though?  I don't know.  That was...  What?  What was on Black and Blue?  What Rolling Stones album came out in 76?  Oh, man.  Because...  Yes?  Rumors are 77.  Oh, 77.  So, throw it away.  Throw that away.  Yeah, I said that.  Throw that shit away.  The Rolling Stones, 76.  Let's see what we got here.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  So, leave.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  There it is.  Uh-huh.  77. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, nothing 76.  What about Led Zeppelin, uh, the Presence album is coming in.  Oh, what?  Presence.  Oh.  Presence.  Not Presence as in Christmas.  Fucking Hinkley should not go free, by the way.  No.  Ever.  Why?  When you shoot a president, you should spend the rest of your shit life in jail.  Yeah, but he was found innocent, too.  Fuck him.  Fuck him.  I think he should rot away in the mental institution.  Yeah, of course.  Forever.  Does he get to, like, roam around a little bit?  Oh, he gets a lot of these visits that he's able to go see his mommy and stuff like that. 
[01:23:00]  So, why doesn't anyone, like, follow him?  I don't know.  No one follows him when he gets to just roam around a little bit?  Nah, I'm not sure if it's supervised or what have you, but...  But how is he under the radar?  Well, they say that he's...  In this day and age.  They say he's, uh, fine.  He's all cured.  No, but I mean, what's Jim Brady doing?  When does he leave?  Yeah, exactly.  I don't know.  Weekend visits sometimes?  Yeah, yeah.  Holidays, things like that.  And just says to the crew, see you, uh, Monday?  Yeah, I'll be back.  Wow.  He tormented Jodie Foster. 
[01:23:30]  Fuck him.  He should die in jail.  Get out of there.  Presence?  Yep, 76.  Nice.  I love Presence.  Led Zeppelin, Presence.  Give him some of the songs off that bad boy.  Fuck it, it was an amazing album.  Cool.  You guys don't like Zeppelin, forget it.  They're okay, but...  Don't worry about it, it's alright.  Overrated.  Very overrated.  Stupid bulge.  Stolen riffs.  Fuck them.  Stupid bulge.  You can't do that to Zeppelin.  Very overrated.  No.  They were good, but come on.  They were good, but you can't say that about Zeppelin. 
[01:24:00]  Sure you can.  They didn't create.  They were massive.  They didn't create a lot of what they...  They created a lot of their own stuff.  Back then, it was proper to steal from the black man.  That was terrible.  Everyone was stealing from the black man.  Rush 2112.  Get the fuck out of here, butch.  I don't even know...  There's one song off 2112, and it's called...  Red Barchetta?  No.  No, that was off Moving Pictures.  As was Tom Sawyer.  As was Limelight.  That was their biggest song.  I love Moving Pictures.  Great album.  That is a great album. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  2112 had 2112, of course.  But what else?  Was The Trees on that?  Or no, that's another great song.  Or Free Will?  Uh...  I know Sam doesn't find it soon.  He's getting his neck kissed.  No, look.  It was all about 2112.  2112 was 20 minutes long.  They didn't even have room to put anything else on this fucking thing.  That's a weird one.  A Passage to Bangkok.  The Twilight Zone.  Lessons.  I don't know any of these songs.  Tears and Something for Nothing.  I don't know any of those.  That stinks.  You're right.  It does stink.  I stink right.  Jimmy had a dream to the point he got up out of bed and started typing. 
[01:25:00]  At 447.  Is it called typing even though you're on your computer?  True.  The act is typing.  It's just not a typewriter.  Right.  Oh.  And you wrote some notes about your dream.  I just...  It's very disjointed but it was a very bizarre dream and I don't know exactly what it was  about.  It started before the dream.  I was in Conan O'Brien's studio and I didn't realize that the stage was raised so I went up  one level and I was trying to get on the stage to see somebody I knew but then the area 
[01:25:30]  was filled up with water so I think I had to piss.  So...  That had nothing to do with the dream.  What do you mean that had nothing to do with the dream?  I was...  I don't know what happened.  Were you dreaming that?  Yeah but then I was at like...  How do you know that had nothing to do with the dream?  Because I remembered it after but it was before.  And then I was at like Brewer's house or somebody's house and the backyard was flooded  and I kept trying to like...  There was a hose in the backyard and I was very thirsty.  I really wanted to drink out of the hose.  Yeah.  Which I hope isn't a fucking blowjob reference.  Yes. 
[01:26:00]  You were thirsty all night.  I was very freaked out.  So here's the main dream.  I don't know what the event was but George Bush Jr. and Bill Clinton were going to be at  the event and I had access to them.  Wow.  And I don't know how I remember but I got a picture with Bill Clinton and I was...  Uh huh.  I met Bush...  I was getting a picture with George Bush.  Yeah.  And he was friendly but I handed my camera to a woman and she was shaking so badly and  the underside...  She was pointing the underside of the camera and I'm like no! 
[01:26:30]  Oh no!  Just completely fucking Jimmy's picture.  And I'm like no no no turn around turn around.  So she's shaking fucking violently.  And then we get the picture and I remember I slapped Bush on the back and I go...  I knew you'd be so much fun to meet and talk to and he was very friendly.  And then as we're done taking our picture I noticed another guy walks around from behind  us.  So I realized I'm like I hope he's not in my fucking picture with us.  Jimmy has these dreams about these picture anxiety things. 
[01:27:00]  But I...  So I look at the picture and it's extremely pixelated and blurry and we look like three  homeboys.  Like I'm in the front and George Bush is...  You can kind of see him behind me.  And this other guy is behind him.  Oh photo bombed you.  But it looked like the actor who played fucking Charles Keating in the movie.  I don't know who that was in the Keating Lone and Scanlon movie.  So I'm like I have to get...  The picture is very very blurry.  So I know I have to get another copy of this picture. 
[01:27:30]  And E-Rock is around and he tells me that these guys are appearing at this other public  place.  And if I just wait there with E-Rock he'll take me there.  But right now he's going to...  Because he's going to help someone else get a picture with the president.  So just stay there with E-Rock.  E-Rock's your go-to guy?  He's my go-to guy.  But I don't remember why but I went back to an old location that I had been in earlier  in the dream to see if the presidents were there.  I got greedy.  And this girl who I really liked was there and she goes no they left.  You missed them.  Oh no.  And she was hurt for some... 
[01:28:00]  Why didn't you listen to E-Rock?  I don't know.  But this girl was hurt.  She was injured.  And she asked to borrow some money for a cup of coffee.  She needed money for a coffee shop.  So I gave her 20.  I'm like no no keep it.  You don't have to pay me back.  Because I wanted her to go out with me.  But I kept giving her my number and reading the digits.  But she couldn't understand the number.  Why don't you hate that?  I was like 7539 and I kept writing it but I couldn't write it where she would read it.  Jesus.  But then I realized I'm missing the president. 
[01:28:30]  I realized I was wasting time here.  I'm wasting time with this dumb bitch.  So I panic and I run back to the place.  It's the Sirius XM office.  But it's a giant open...  Like you ever see the inside of a shopping mall with like an open air vestibule and all  these shops around?  Yes.  That's what the office was like.  And Jim Brewer was there and Keith Robinson was there.  And I'm like where's E-Rock?  And they're all laughing at me.  Ah stupid looking for E-Rock.  And they're all laughing at me because I'm trying to find Eric.  And I'm looking through my cell phone for fucking E-Rock's number and I'm panicking. 
[01:29:00]  Because I look up E-Rock and I realize I have him under Eric and I just keep dialing the  wrong number and I can't get fucking E-Rock.  Oh my god.  This is so exhausting.  So I finally bump into Andrew Moss who is our CFO, the Chief Financial Officer here who  is who I know and I like.  And he's wearing a college sweatshirt and he's bleeding from the lip and he has blood  all over the front of his shirt.  Jeez.  I probably punched him. 
[01:29:30]  No, he didn't look hurt.  He just had blood on the front of his shirt.  But I knew him wearing a college sweatshirt, man.  He wasn't well dressed anymore.  I missed the event.  And he goes, I go like, is it happening?  Did I miss it?  He goes, no, no.  But I think we're leaving.  He goes, the address is 5th and Beam.  5th and Beam.  So I have to get to 5th and Beam here in Manhattan.  And I'm walking along and I hear this old lady driving by yelling at the car and a black  guy I see in front of me.  She's like, it's him.  It's him. 
[01:30:00]  He's the one.  I think he's on acid.  But I'm like, I'm worried.  I'm worried that this was a tranny dream because I'm writing it out.  And I was rushing this morning when I wrote it out.  I wrote it space him.  But I put the S in the wrong place.  It was shim.  I'm like, oh, my God.  I hope this wasn't a shemale dream.  Shim.  Because I'm walking and I know that this black guy is trouble.  And I fucking, I know that he's a problem.  And I hear him walk around and start walking with the group I'm walking with. 
[01:30:30]  I don't know who they are.  And he starts to bother this girl that I'm walking with.  And I'm like, I know I have to step in here and say something.  So I finally say something like, so leave her alone.  Stop bothering her.  And I punch this black guy in the face.  But he turns and it's a tranny.  Oh, no.  But it's not a real face.  It's a doll face looking at me.  It was a black plastic doll face.  And so I say, is anybody going to help me here?  Is anybody going to help me? 
[01:31:00]  And this white guy is looking at me and he's disinterested and he walks away.  So now I have to fight this person.  But I also have to get downtown and see the president.  So I hop in a cab.  And when I hop in a cab, Iraq comes over and he's wearing a tuxedo.  And he looks in the window and I know I've missed the event because he's holding like  a fucking booklet that I know is from the event.  And he goes, what did he say to me?  He goes, he goes, oh, we were in the wrong place before.  And I know he's telling me. 
[01:31:30]  And I know he has photos with both presidents.  And I know I've missed the event because this asshole is smiling and beaming.  And I'm like, I should have just stuck with Iraq.  And so I get in the cab and I tell the guy, we have to go to Fifth and Beam.  And he's running red lights for me.  And then I realize we're driving down suburban roads.  And this is the wrong place.  You're not in the city?  But now I wonder if it's a drinking dream because Fifth and Beam, was I thinking Fifth  of Jim Beam?  Oh.  Or was that a drunk dream?  I don't know what that was. 
[01:32:00]  And then I woke up.  That was my entire dream.  That is so fucked up.  I like the detail of the plastic face.  The plastic doll face.  That's just that'd be scary.  With like girl doll hair.  And Iraq in his tuxedo.  And I knew that he had photos.  Oh, and Opie's mention was I remember saying I wanted to tell George Bush that Opie has a  picture with Clinton.  So I want to get a picture with both of you guys.  So I have a better picture than Opie.  Like I wanted to tell this to George Bush.  Wow.  That's a real thing between me and Jimmy.  I bust them all the time that I have a much better picture than he is. 
[01:32:30]  But I wanted to tell the president.  But it was fucking the frustration of seeing this girl and like giving her 20.  It was so weird.  She had to go to the coffee shop and needed money.  But the frustration of not being heard by this woman.  Her not hearing.  It's all hookers.  It's a weird sex drinking dream deep down.  Yeah.  You think that was what it was?  I don't know what it means.  Coke Logic's got to animate the Jimmy dream.  I don't know what it means.  But you're rocking his tuxedo.  I knew that he had pictures with the presidents.  And I'm like, why didn't I just?  It's almost like I feel like I'm missing out on life by doing all this sexual shit. 
[01:33:00]  Because I was trying to give this girl my number.  And I gave her money.  But meanwhile, I'm missing.  You're missing what you want to do.  The event.  I'm missing the event.  The big thing.  It really shook me when I woke up, though.  I couldn't go back to sleep.  I was really bothered.  That's weird.  Yeah.  Might mean nothing.  Yeah.  There's a lot of meaning in there.  I don't know.  Picture taking.  I think it's...  I don't know.  Are dreams really like...  You're constantly chasing something that's just out of reach.  Do you look at dreams like that and get so deep into them? 
[01:33:30]  Or are they very just surface-oriented synapse fucking snapping?  I think they're nonsense.  Because I think, first of all, you can't...  You know, when people read your dreams, it's stupid.  Because you don't even remember all of the dream.  You only remember certain little, tiny little things.  Very, very rough.  That's pretty detailed because you woke up and did that.  That is real good.  Because he was able to get out of bed.  Most people wouldn't get out of bed.  And then they would try to tell someone what their dream was about.  Yeah.  And then that person will go, well, I know exactly what's going on in your life because of what you told me. 
[01:34:00]  Stupid.  I try to just go right back to sleep and continue.  I thought of that, too.  But I'm going to figure out why I have this picture obsession.  I don't know if I talked about this, but I told you, I wrote about it in Happy Endings when I was a kid.  I had that crush on that girl.  I loved her and I didn't know.  We got caught fooling around under the blanket kissing.  But I don't remember what happened.  But she was moving and my parents were like, go say goodbye to her, go say goodbye to her.  And I couldn't say goodbye to her.  I couldn't do it.  I just froze in my house and I looked at my clothes all folded and I couldn't do it. 
[01:34:30]  So I went down and she had already left.  So I never saw her again after that.  Never.  But I always wondered if capturing these celebrity moments, it's almost like with ex-girlfriends or whatever, I always keep them around.  Even as friends, I can't let go.  And it's almost like because I missed this fucking thing, I have to capture it and fucking corral it and keep it.  Because I've never forgotten that moment of looking at those clothes.  And I joked about it in my book.  But seeing that fucking folded pile of clothes and not being able to get dressed, not being able to move myself and go say goodbye to that girl. 
[01:35:00]  Why couldn't you?  Like, why couldn't you?  I just, I couldn't.  It was too sad.  It was if I don't acknowledge it, it won't be true.  Yeah.  I couldn't.  How old were you?  Maybe five or six.  It was a puppy love crush thing.  It wasn't sexual.  It was like, I don't remember her name or what she looked like.  Well, we've talked about this.  That's hardcore sex for a five-year-old.  It's that same emotion.  Yeah.  Same intensity.  Not having sex as a five-year-old, but it's the same type of shit in your head, though. 
[01:35:30]  Oh, yeah.  I think I was there.  I was really in love with someone.  Hanging around with exes.  Get the fuck out.  No, but not even hanging around with them, but just knowing that I can occasionally corral them.  Even as friends, like, I don't want to fuck them.  I don't fuck my ex-girlfriends ever.  Or just having them around still in some way?  Fuck that.  But there's one from 10 years ago who I think is mad at me and she won't talk to me anymore.  Yeah, and I don't know why, but I'm like, I'm curious, like, how is she doing?  I don't want to date her.  I don't want to fuck her, but I just want to know how she is. 
[01:36:00]  I don't know why I can't just go fuck these people and put them out of my life anymore.  Or, like, why do I have to capture every moment on...  It's almost like if I meet these celebrities, I don't bother them.  I really don't want to go hang out with them.  I don't...  I have fucking some of their numbers.  I have fucking Omar's number.  Jamie Hector.  I've texted them a couple of times, like, hey, if you want to come down to the cellar.  But not incessantly.  I don't need them in my life being best friends.  I don't try to overtake their lives.  Why do I corral these fucking moments?  Yeah, but some of those guys want to be friends with you. 
[01:36:30]  Some of them do.  Just on a real level, too, by the way.  Not because, you know, you're famous and he's famous.  I think some of them might want to.  We could have used you at Radiohead.  Why?  We fucking ran into Skrull Johansson, and me and Ant didn't know how to get the picture done.  We both had our cameras out, and we just couldn't figure it out.  I already have a shot with her, so I wouldn't have cared.  But she was with Ryan Reynolds.  That was the picture.  And we knew before it hit the press that they might be back together.  They went to Radiohead together, which is a huge scoop.  Not that we wanted to take a picture and then flood it out there, but I just wanted a picture 
[01:37:00]  with Skrull Johansson.  Yeah.  I didn't know how to ask her.  And Anthony, same thing.  I've seen her twice in person.  Once at the Woody Allen premiere, which I got a photo with her.  And once I saw her out to dinner, I was in a restaurant.  She's just fucking beautiful, man.  She's juicy.  She is juicy.  She's absolutely...  That's how you described it earlier.  It's perfect.  Juicy.  She's juicy.  She's a perfect woman.  She's juicy.  But we didn't get it done, man.  We had our cameras out.  I was like, fuck.  What are we doing?  You got to make sure that they know you don't want a picture of them. 
[01:37:30]  Like, you got to say, do you mind if we take a picture together?  And usually if you have the camera ready, they'll let you.  Like, in that situation, she might have been afraid of paparazzi, or maybe she didn't want  a picture.  But then Ryan Reynolds remembered.  He remembered doing our show.  It was a...  It might have helped you, actually.  Did he introduce you to her?  No, because everyone knew.  Whoa, these two are together here?  This is a little crazy, because everyone knows they were separated.  I think that's what they were a little nervous about.  And I think we felt...  You know what, Ann?  I think we felt their vibe, like, oh, fuck.  We really don't want any pictures here.  Yeah, that's what it was.  It was just kind of like...  I bet you that's what it was.  They were very, you know, standoffish. 
[01:38:00]  But then when they were hanging out at the table, there was some, you know, physical  contact.  A little canoogling?  Yeah.  Hair stroking, things like that.  Back rubbing.  Yeah.  She's fucking beautiful, man.  There's shit going on.  You probably saw the pictures like we did.  And said, what am I doing?  She tried to ugly herself up.  Yeah, she's wearing some big dorky glasses and fucking, like, a hat and, you know, some  frumpy clothes.  But people knew she was there. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, yeah.  She's a good actress, too.  Oh, yeah.  Scarlett Johansson's very good.  By the way, I...  Edward Norton was there, too.  Edward Norton?  Edward.  Edward Norton was there.  Edward, did he bore you to death?  No, actually, he was so into it.  He was dancing around like a maniac, doing some weird dancing thing.  And then there's one Radiohead song he started playing.  It was very, like, mellow beginning and stuff.  And somebody was trying to yell something at Edward Norton. 
[01:39:00]  Uh, and he just turned around and he goes, why don't you shut the fuck up?  Nice.  To the guy.  And it was, like, really mean.  I think he might have had a couple in them.  Nice.  But, uh...  So maybe he's not a good actor.  I don't know.  That's just part of his personality.  That's pretty good.  Because we've seen that in a few movies where he snaps.  Oh, yeah.  It was a great, why don't you shut the fuck up?  Really?  And then the guy, shut the fuck up.  That's for sure.  Don't bother a guy while he's enjoying the music.  I know.  I got a picture with him after the show.  Well, you know him.  And then Jack Black.  Why did you get one here?  Oh, I think I got one here.  I got one here. 
[01:39:30]  Do you remember him?  Of course he did, right?  Yeah, yeah.  He was pretty cool.  And Jack Black, let me tell you.  Oh, enough with Jack Black.  That Jack Black.  He was there?  I didn't see him.  Oh, my God, dude.  He was making weird faces and playing air guitar.  I fucking hate him.  I hate him.  How much attention do you need?  I know.  Stop trying to be.  Why is he an A-list celebrity?  I don't get it.  I don't fucking know, man.  He's got the Tom Arnold thing.  He's terrible.  You hit Hollywood, and for some reason, you can't do any wrong for a really long time.  You might be right.  That might be it. 
[01:40:00]  I don't know.  I don't like him.  His air guitar shit.  Stop trying to be the rocker funny guy.  He was being the rocker guy.  Like, he was rocking.  And he's in that group of guys where, you know, when they were coming up, they did our  show, and couldn't have been nicer, and then they just fucking turned into cunts.  He was a twat when I saw him at Leno.  He didn't even say hi.  Really?  All of a sudden, it turns into twats.  Yeah.  It's like, do you remember when no one knew you?  You came on our show, and we all were palsy-wowsies.  He won't say.  He won't even say hi. 
[01:40:30]  He's just one of these fucking.  Really?  Yeah.  Fuck Jack Black.  I agree.  Like a stupid asshole.  Dick bag.  Fuck you.  Let's fucking fight.  I'll fight you right the fuck now.  No problem.  Where are you?  I'll find you.  Dreams.  Nice.  Good dream, Jimmy.  Yeah.  I wish I knew what it meant.  It's just a dream.  No, I think that they...  I'll tell you why.  Because too many times I've dreamt of water and had to piss when I woke up.  So there was a connection between the conscious and the unconscious. 
[01:41:00]  But that just means your bladder's full.  Yes.  But I'm just saying that there's a connection between what's really happening and...  I think there is.  Yeah.  I think it's, you know, I think it's a stress dream.  Where you're chasing that celebrity photo and you just...  And of course you don't get it done.  But the girl and the money meant something.  Because I remember feeling for her.  Like really liking her.  And her arm was hurt.  And I wanted to take care of her.  And I wanted to give her money to be okay.  It wasn't a sex thing.  But you wanted to get to see the presidents and take a picture. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  And you wasted your time.  She had something to do with the military too.  But I remember hearing, just giving her 20.  Going, don't pay me back.  Just keep it.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was weird.  It's so impossible to read something in dreams.  You ever pick something up and try to read it?  And it's like, this is just, it's not making sense.  Yep.  Ah, and you read it.  And the words are all fucked up.  Some old language that's not around anymore.  Why can't I, uh, why can't I read this?  I was so afraid.  She was going to think my fives were a three and my threes were a five. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  Ugh.  What does that mean?  Writing down.  I don't know.  Oh.  But you ever write really quick or something?  It just looks like a five.  It could be a three or a five if you write.  Did you give out your phone number in there?  No.  People are saying that they now know part of your phone number.  Okay.  It wasn't my real number.  Oh, would you stop people?  I wasn't writing my real number in the dream.  Is that the actual numbers in your dream?  Five and the three, I believe, were, yeah.  Oh, because people.  Because that was the confusion or a seven.  People want to play those numbers today, too.  Oh, wow.  Have fun, yeah.  I don't remember what they were.  Good luck to you, everybody.  Good luck.  How great would it be if those were today's numbers? 
[01:42:30]  Oh, creepy.  Yeah, that would be creepy.  Creepy.  Yeah, I wrote a movie about myself called The Seer.  The Seer.  The Seer.  He sees things.  You're a seer.  Did you hear the Drew Boogie thing?  We should go to break with that.  I did not.  Oh, that is good.  Oh, he did something.  I didn't hear it.  Yeah.  Do the long version, man.  It was great, man.  Long version, and then we'll do Jocktober.  Start off.  Oh, please.  Jocktober next?  Yes, I can't wait.  Everybody was clamoring about it on Twitter, saying, happy Jocktober.

I don't want to be Opie Frog  Well if you were there  You'd have to be  We might visit other  Froggy stations  Because there are a lot of  Frog radio stations  And like some of them  Frog  Frog  Frog  Frog  Frog  Frog  Frog  That's how he says  Frog  Frog  What is the  What is the thing in your room  That you open the door  And hang your clothes in?  Very good  Closet  A closet  A closet  A closet 
[01:53:30]  Closet  How do you say it?  Closet  It's a closet  Closet  Closet  What is it?  C-L-O-U-S-C-O-S-S-E.  Yeah, but it's pronounced like you say closet.  No, you say closet.  Closet.  How do you say it?  Closet.  Closet.  That's what you say on a contract.  Put a closet.  What do you say?  Santa Claus?  Santa Claus.  Yeah, well, that's claw because there's a U in there.  Closet.  A-A-L.  How do you say this radio station again? 
[01:54:00]  Froggy.  No, say it like you say it.  Froggy.  Stick up.  Froggy.  Froggy.  Froggy.  You say froggy.  You are an idiot.  England fucked up and fucked you up, man.  No, it didn't.  It fucked you up.  Yes, it did.  And the language is called English, so obviously they know what they're doing over there.  What?  England, English.  They suck.  They don't.  They know what they're doing.  Yeah.  Watch that Euro.  Well, they're not great with...  It's fucking falling apart, that shit union.  So I couldn't be happier than to watch a union collapse in that European Union. 
[01:54:30]  Shitheads.  Fuck them.  They're going to let fucking Greece just go away.  They should.  They're going to say, fuck you, Greece.  Again, they all hated America.  America's this bad guy.  Go fuck yourselves.  So froggy.  I can get a bad guy.  Froggy.  Yeah, like they...  There's a bunch of froggies.  94.9, 103.5, 104.3.  They're all froggy stations.  Well, all those frequencies are running this station, and then there are other stations  that also hold the same name, and some of their jocks include, like, Tadpole... 
[01:55:00]  Wait, so your name has to...  Oh, my God.  It has to be radio.  Ew, they're all fucking connected like that?  They have to be connected to the frog, and...  Yeah.  So not everyone gets the frog last name?  No, no, no, no, no.  Some people are actually called...  I guess if you're a part-timer, you're like a Tadpole.  Like a female jock would be called, like, Lily Pad.  No, that's cool.  No, no, no, no.  On the maxi pad.  No, no, no, no.  Because they bleed from the vagina.  Like, see, there's...  This is...  This is Leapin' Leah. 
[01:55:30]  Ah, because she's Leapin'.  She does the weeknights.  Oh, my God.  Because they jump.  Like a frog.  Fucking pride in yourself.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's horrendous.  I would say, if you want me to work there, I'm not doing the froggy.  What about Dissected Dan?  Is he there?  See, because they...  How about Jumpin' Jerry?  How about Hoppin' Hal?  Well, the sad part is the real names are just as bad.  Look at this.  Go ahead.  Terry the Tadpole.  Terry the Tadpole.  He's an old guy.  What are you doing, Terry the Tadpole?  Let's turn the Tadpole here on the froggy. 
[01:56:00]  Hey, on froggy.  Wendy Green.  Wendy Green.  Frog.  Jimmy Roach.  I don't even know it.  They eat roaches?  I guess.  I don't know.  They smoke pot?  I don't know.  Whose idea was this?  You think that's a good idea?  Oh, Jesus.  Why does radio do this to us?  We got a whole froggy theme here now.  If you're gonna take this job, and we do want you aboard, what do you think you'd want  to have as your frog name?  Well, I guess Sam Roberts.  No, Sam, Sam, you need a froggy name. 
[01:56:30]  Why?  Could you imagine having to sit with a fucking GM or a PD and come up with a frog name?  Sam Frogerts.  Your name should be Sam Cunt.  Yeah.  Well, Cunt doesn't work on terrestrial radio.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It has nothing to do with frogs.  Yeah, it does.  Frogs.  Frogs.  Frogs.  Frog.  That's how you say frog.  So who's Danger Frog?  Well, Danger Frog, he was doing the morning show.  Oh, that's a good question.  Sorry, Sam.  Yeah, no.  Is there a Pollywog on this station? 
[01:57:00]  A Pollywog?  Yeah.  There really is a Pollywog?  Not on this station, but on another station there is.  A girl named Pollywog.  That would be the, that's like the best froggy name you could have.  I think if you're going to have a froggy name, Pollywog would be good.  Pollywog.  Hey, it's Pollywog with you on the froggy.  Pollywog.  This is a different Froggy 104 in a different city.  How can it be different?  How can it be different, Sam?  How can it be different?  But it's the same logo, the same froggy.  What's happening?  Sam Ribberts.  What's happening?  Oh! 
[01:57:30]  Matt Willis.  That's perfect.  Oh, you know what?  It came in a couple times, and we'll give it to Doug in Salt Lake City.  Sam Ribberts.  Sam Ribberts is coming in.  Or Ribberts.  The frog jocks on this Froggy 104 include Pollywog, Tad Pole, and Sally Mander.  Well, that's just another amphibian.  Yeah, that doesn't even work at all.  Well, that's stretching a little bit, don't you think?  Yeah.  Yes.  Leap and Leah.  Yeah, why don't we keep it with the frog theme and keep the salamanders out of it?  Exactly.  There's no room for salamanders here on Froggy. 
[01:58:00]  Samphibian.  Samphibian is pretty good.  That's a little clever.  You could use that.  Plus, it sounds a little edgy.  It'll get the young audience.  I'm sure you'll get your cronies in the 10 o'clock hour to discuss this for an hour.  They'll all come up with a name for you.  Frog names.  And then you can give the rest of the cronies their frog name during the 10 o'clock hour today.  We all need to, you know, find jobs once the O.B. and Anthony show doesn't work anymore.  And once you guys are gone, we're going to need to find jobs at the Froggy station.  That's true.  What are you hearing about us being gone?  Well, you announced last week that you were going to walk out before your contract was over. 
[01:58:30]  So that's what I'm hearing about you.  I was having a moment.  I was having a moment.  Okay.  I was having a moment.  Does anyone believe this shit at this point?  I don't know, but that's what I heard.  We just yell and scream a lot.  At least we admit that you shouldn't believe our shit.  Thank God.  Unlike Mr. Vacation.  Oh, I know what you're talking about.  Hey, should we have virus names here?  Yeah.  Oh, that'd be great.  We should all have virus names.  Yes.  All the air staff needs to have virus names. 
[01:59:00]  Well, I have to be Anthony Aids.  Anthony Aids, you got it.  Anthony Aids.  Yeah, you know, it's like Anthony Aids.  I'll go with Opie Herplip.  No, it's got to have a flow to it.  What?  What about poliope?  That's not nice.  That's not bad, though, but it makes sense.  Poliope.  Yeah, that's better.  My aunt had polio growing up, and she's in the medical fucking journals.  Oh, damn.  So let's leave the polio alone.  Oh, boy.  It's a virus.  What was she in the journal's eyes? 
[01:59:30]  They fucking figure her shit out.  What did old turnip legs have?  Exactly.  What was her nickname?  Clean Shoes McGillicunny?  They some, I don't know, they did some experimental shit, and she's in the journals.  She fucking walks around nice.  All the more reason you should be poliope.  I'm sorry, Eric.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  But Eric's name is Bullfrog Nagel.  I'm Bullfrog Nagel, because that's the biggest frog.  I'm sorry.  That's Mac, not me.  Oh, they're calling him E. coli Nagel. 
[02:00:00]  E. coli.  Yeah.  That's great.  What does Doug in Salt Lake City want credit for?  Oh, thanks for the credit.  Oh, you're welcome.  We give the credit out.  Okay.  Salmonella.  Salmonella.  Salmonella.  That's awesome.  That's a good virus name.  Sure.  Sure.  Even though I do believe that's a bacteria.  Yeah, but that's like the salamander deal.  How about Anthony's Sneezy Face?  That doesn't work at all.  I like it.  I'm taking it. 
[02:00:30]  Sneezy.  But it should be more like AIDS than E, not Anthony AIDS.  Right, right, right.  AIDS than E.  Let's go to Mike in PA.  Mikey.  Mike.  You're listening to Froggy 101 with today's frog cast from Captain Kermit the Weather Hermit.  Is that real?  It's real.  Oh, my God.  Oh, I could be Anthrax.  Anthrax.  Anthrax is nice.  You hear about that?  The hermit guy who does the weather?  Hermit the Kermit.  Hermit the Kermit.  Hermit the Hermit.  What?  Oh, my God.  And it just frogs everywhere.  Jimmy Norton antivirus. 
[02:01:00]  That's great.  The Norton antivirus.  Yeah.  Like the computer thing.  And Jim comes in and cools everyone down when everybody gets heated up.  Right.  The antivirus.  Right.  Yeah, I don't like when things get too crazy.  Right.  I like to keep it...  How about...  How about Eric the cold carrier or something?  That's good.  I don't think it works.  I don't think that works at all.  How about...  Oh, man.  Club soda.  How about Petri dish, Kenny? 
[02:01:30]  All right.  So, Danger Frog.  Froggy.  Yeah, the Froggy Station.  Yeah, it's Danger Frog and Tracy Morgan.  I can't find any pictures of this Tracy Morgan, but it's not...  It's not Tracy.  Does he act like Tracy Morgan?  It's a her, and she is almost as funny.  What do you mean, act like Tracy Morgan?  How would that be?  Fucking be unpredictable and blow off radio shows that were nice to her?  Yeah.  Yeah, fuck him, too.  I'm done with all these assholes.  What the fuck?  Grab a kidney and run?  Oh, Jesus. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Tracy used to do our show all the time.  He literally forgot who we were.  Big star.  Are you serious?  It's mind-boggling to me.  Well, Danger and Tracy is like...  Yeah.  There are different types of shows on Jocktober.  Yeah.  And some are like, they have the whole, and some are just the wacky, goofy people.  Yeah.  Danger and Tracy, the show that I wanted to start out with, is the perfect example of  a show that just...  I mean, this is two hours of their highlighted... 
[02:02:30]  This is the best stuff they did in two hours.  Best.  Yeah, I mean...  Yeah.  I kind of disagree how we do Jocktober, but in a way, I'm starting to see it your way.  Like, we could kill any show.  Any show.  Even us in our prime, you could kill us by picking out those moments where we suck, obviously.  Yeah.  So, but what Sam's doing is he's, through the listeners, finding these hacky shows, and  then he's only doing a two-hour block from one fucking show.  Right.  No, like, best ofs. 
[02:03:00]  No, like, searching through for a week.  It's just...  Searching through a week until you find the worst of the worst.  The really bad stuff.  Like, this is one...  It's a typical show, and this is the very best that they did in two hours.  All right.  You ready to play some of this shit, Ant?  Oh, please.  Jimmy, ready?  I'm very ready.  All right, Jocktober begins with Froggy 104.  We should read the descriptions of the clips before you pull.  Okay.  Danger and Tracy Morgan in the morning.  Why would she go with Tracy Morgan as her name?  I don't know.  It doesn't even sound like a frog.  No.  Danger and Tracy ooze chemistry as danger goes for some material on how much money Toby Keith 
[02:03:30]  makes, and Tracy won't allow it to go anywhere.  Oh, boy.  Oh, it's a whole shit?  Just listen to this chemistry.  It's like, danger's like, I got some material here, and Tracy's like, let me back you up  with this.  Oh, shit.  What do you mean back you up?  Like, you know how, like, when you're rolling with something, an ant will spice it up here,  and it'll let you keep rolling, and you guys just...  And then you throw something to ant, and the ant can roll with it.  Oh, yeah.  And you guys just go back and forth, and all of a sudden, this one little nugget turns into  this half hour of amazing... 
[02:04:00]  That's kind of like what Danger and Tracy do.  Oh, okay.  It's kind of the same gist.  And Danger's premise is just so good in general that you would think...  So...  Yeah, that...  It's got, like, hours of material.  I don't know what's better.  So, like us, they do have, like, a bunch of shit in front of them, but in that case,  they just make a shit castle.  Yeah.  That no one gives a fuck about.  Right.  Gotcha.  But we turn it into gold.  Oh, gold.  Gold from shit.  All right, here's Danger and Tracy.  Rocky 104 in the morning at 6.05, Danger and Tracy Morgan. 
[02:04:30]  Toby Keith there, Made in America.  His new CD, by the way, Clancy's Tavern, comes out next month.  Very good.  A little tidbit there for you.  A little tidbit.  And I'll give you one more tidbit.  We're getting ready to do the Nashville Nugget, so I'm just...  What's the Nashville Nugget?  Nashville.  The Nashville Nugget.  Oh, the Nashville Nugget.  The Nashville Nugget.  Is where danger gives you...  Danger Frog, I'm sorry.  Where Danger Frog gives you...  See, this is not real.  All the latest news in country.  In the world of country music.  I did leave a Nashville Nugget in the hotel toilet when I was there. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  Hard to flush, though.  No, it's a news.  It's a block of entertainment, country music news.  Came out of my ass like I was dumping out a box of milk duds.  No, it's...  I hate those shits.  Just go on the air and talk.  Not everything has to be packaged.  Well, the thing is, you need to get the listeners to listen at 20 after the hour or whenever  it is, because they know that's when the Nashville Nugget comes.  Nashville Nugget.  And they can't live without it.  No, they want to hear Danger reading Danger Frog. 
[02:05:30]  Tidbit.  We're getting ready to do the Nashville Nugget, so I'm just giving away all my country music  stories, but Toby Keith named the highest paid country music star by Forbes magazine,  made $50 million, $50 million, in the last year.  That's it.  A chunk of change.  And by the way, his comment on that was, why does anybody care?  Well, people like to know how much money people make.  Yeah.  It's interesting.  It's curious.  Toby made $50 million last year.  Maybe I should become a country singer.  All right.  I'll stop.  All right. 
[02:06:00]  Wow.  Holy shit.  I'm fucking sweating.  Wow.  I don't even know these people.  That's like, to them, that's like, all right, we're really swinging on that one.  That's a Nashville Nugget.  Oh, that's not, that's not the Nashville Nugget.  Like, that was only a...  That was like a guy on the break the whole time you're trying to fucking drive.  Uh-huh.  You know what I mean?  Like, all right, is it going to happen here?  Is the chemistry going to start here?  Eh.  And they just, they're just there to laugh at their own jokes because the other one won't  laugh at the other's jokes because they're not jokes. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  They're just observations.  I was just like reading from a newspaper.  Yeah.  You got to add to it a little bit, right?  Yeah.  All right.  Should we move right on?  Yeah.  I mean, if you, because you guys said that you wanted to hear what the Nashville Nugget was  all about.  I didn't say that.  Ant did.  He said he wanted to hear the Nashville Nugget.  Of course I did.  Danger does a story about Carrie Underwood's cell phone and internet connection.  That's right.  Part of the Nashville Nugget. 
[02:07:00]  This sounds good.  Oh, and you know what?  Carrie Underwood, we found out yesterday, she wants to have two kids.  Yes.  Her hockey-playing husband, Mike Fisher, wants to have four.  Four.  Mm-hmm.  But we also find out today that she doesn't tweet or like fancy phones.  What?  She says, quote, I don't do apps and I don't tweet.  There you go.  Most women her age are all over it while driving.  But she says she takes after her mom who still has a dial-up internet connection.  Well, she's preparing herself for motherhood because when she's a mother, she's not going 
[02:07:30]  to have time to tweet or do Facebook or anything else.  Or anything else.  Ralph.  Did you hear?  Ralph.  Oh, Ralph.  You know how you can tell when a laughter is genuine?  Yeah.  When there is a ha and a ha and that's the end of the laugh.  When it's just ha ha.  What is a bitch?  That's a genuine laugh.  Why does she have to be a typical bitch?  What is she talking about?  I got a kid.  My wife's got a kid too, obviously.  And she's Facebook and I'm tweeting.  What are you talking about?  You got to admit, ever since you started, you became a father, you gave up the YouTube 
[02:08:00]  and Twitter channels that you have.  I haven't seen you tweet in months.  I actually tweet way more now because I'm sitting around with the kid.  But the YouTube thing is.  You actually do more of that.  Oh.  Just get out of the house more.  So now I'm in the house a little more.  So I jump on my Twitter or whatever.  No.  Wow.  And that's what most fucking parents do.  That's not true.  I heard Tracy Morgan.  The girl Tracy Morgan.  The girl Tracy Morgan.  The funny Tracy Morgan. 
[02:08:30]  She begs to differ.  Oh, damn you.  So, about an hour later, they do the exact same story.  Oh, no.  You know how you guys have said that one of the things you did on N.E.W. were you knew  how commercial radio worked.  So if you had a really good bit, you would air it again later in the day.  Well, there was a real reason for that.  We just didn't have enough material yet.  Right.  Tracy.  Right?  Yeah.  That's what it comes down to.  I mean, we knew early on in our show at N.E.W. if we had something really good, we 
[02:09:00]  could play it later on.  But the fact was, because we had nothing else to go to.  Tracy and Danger, that was theirs.  They were like, oh, we got to do that Carrie Underwood thing again in one hour.  So an hour later, they do the exact same story, but Danger tries to punch it up with  a new zinger on dial-up internet.  I feel like he's had a little time now to sit with the story.  Because Tracy did the story.  And now, instead of just giving the audience the exact same thing, Danger is able to sit  with it for a little while, do a little writing while the songs were playing, and come up 
[02:09:30]  with something that really is going to make the people at home remember, Danger Frog.  And thank God for Danger Frog, because I was thinking on the way in that we don't have  enough zingers about dial-up internet.  So I'm so glad someone...  Yeah, I was on the way in today.  Because I was noticing...  I'm so glad that someone has taken up the cause.  The whole...  The first two hours of today's show, you especially, Opie, had no zingers about dial-up internet.  I was just kind of waiting, because I knew Danger Frog had a few.  I didn't want to step on his fucking toes.  Yeah, that's true.  Why the fuck are they even talking about that? 
[02:10:00]  Who has dial-up to begin with, where this is a relatable fucking topic?  Froggy listeners, I bet.  Get a lot of them.  Get the fuck out.  It's part of the Nashville Nugget.  Everybody can relate to the Nashville Nugget.  I'm talking to the whole room.  How many people do you know that have dial-up right now?  Nobody.  Zero.  Zero.  I know 35,217 of my closest friends, Gregory.  Just gave me hiccups.  Fuck. 
[02:10:30]  All right, same story.  I love dial-up.  That lets me know that my connection's about to begin, and the fun's going to start.  Fun time.  I'm surprised you don't sell some kind of dial-up service.  I do.  Oh, you do?  Yes, I do.  I sell 14 kilobytes per second.  14K mode of speed, buckaroo. 
[02:11:00]  That's flying.  Oh, it certainly is.  I understand some people have tried to watch videos.  It's impossible.  Very good.  People are bringing up Fez has dial-up, but I don't know Fez.  I said people I know.  Oh, you don't know Fez?  I don't know him.  I say hi to him in the hall.  But you don't like him?  I don't know.  I don't know the first thing about him.  He can't possibly have dial-up.  I wouldn't think so.  He's in Yahoo News all the time.  Yeah, yeah.  Yahoo!  All right, here we go.  So the same story an hour later, but he pumps it up. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah, a little zinger at the end.  All right.  Yesterday, we found out that Carrie Underwood wants to have two kids with her hockey-playing  husband, Mike Fisher.  He wants four.  Well, today we find out that she doesn't tweet and she doesn't have a fancy phone.  Most young women want a fancy phone.  Yeah, they want, yeah, all the bling.  Not Carrie Underwood.  She says, people can call me or text, but I don't do apps and I don't tweet.  She says she takes after her mom who still has dial-up internet.  Really? 
[02:12:00]  Like, that's so bad.  Wow.  It is slow, though.  Holy shit.  She had an hour to figure it out.  There's nothing really.  Going to Tracy Morgan's stupid fucking broadhead.  But she had an hour to figure out one line about this dumb story.  And what she added an hour later was, really?  You also have to listen to Danger Frog again, because not only does he refuse to come up  with a joke, but he won't even take an opinion. 
[02:12:30]  First, he says, it's not that bad.  And then he says, but it is slow.  Slow.  He's like, oh, I mean, but it's not that bad, but it is bad.  The PD says, don't alienate the audience.  Now, a lot of them have 14K.  Yeah, a lot of them are dial-up people here.  Even if they had dial-up, would they be, like, supporters of dial-up?  Like, fans?  Like, don't insult dial-up?  Yes, they will leave froggy.  Well, you don't want to seem like you're insulting a lot of the people.  No.  That it's a class warfare issue.  Yet, what you do want to do also is let people know that you're on the cutting edge 
[02:13:00]  of technology, and you have a cable modem.  Right.  I'm aware that dial-up is slow.  To some people.  To some people.  And it's fine.  That's what you want.  How great would it be if he had just melted down and said that she doesn't have dial-up,  and then if he just blurted out, well, then how does she watch shit porn?  And the girl went, what?  And he went, did I say that or think it?  And then that would be a human resources issue.  Danger frog.  I want to hear what she added.  Okay. 
[02:13:30]  I'm going to do it again, and let's write down what she added to a story that she added  an hour to prepare for.  Hour.  Because they already did the story.  Yesterday, we found out that Carrie Underwood wants to have two kids with her hockey-playing  husband, Mike Fisher.  He wants four.  Well, today we find out that she doesn't tweet, and she doesn't have a fancy phone.  Most young women want a fancy phone.  Oh, they want, yeah.  All the bling.  Not Carrie Underwood.  She says, people can call me or text, but I don't do apps, and I don't tweet.  She says she takes after her mom, who still has dial-up internet. 
[02:14:00]  Really?  Like, that's so bad.  Wow.  It is slow, though.  Okay.  I wrote it all down.  You got it.  I like the bling part.  I want to be a program director.  I would set this stupid bitch down and say, we're cutting your pay in half.  An hour later, same fucking story.  Same story.  You're sitting around as the music's playing, because I'm assuming they're playing music.  She could actually try to figure out something.  Lots of music.  She had, mm-hmm, twice. 
[02:14:30]  Mm-hmm.  Something with a yeah.  Really?  And wow.  That's what she added.  No, she said, she goes, no, some girls, you know, the bling.  The bling.  The bling with the phone.  I think you might have missed a...  You missed the bling.  You missed a, quote, the bling.  Was that part of the yeah?  Yeah, it was probably...  She was probably like, yeah, it was the bling.  All right, fair enough.  So yes, what?  Yeah, the bling.  Yeah, yeah, the bling.  That's what she goes.  Because she goes, so, you know, she doesn't like the fancy phones.  Yeah.  You know, so some girls like those fancy phones.  Yeah, the bling. 
[02:15:00]  Of course, after she said, really, he should have responded, yes, I told you an hour ago.  Really?  Yeah, remember what I said an hour ago to you?  The same story and wording.  Broads do not belong in radio.  You lummox.  Broads don't belong.  But that's not to say that Danger Frog is overly talented either.  True.  Oh, please.  Yeah.  Let's be fair.  Let's fucking...  Let's put this in perspective here.  So then let her read the stupid story.  Yeah.  And then let him fucking punch it up with his zingers. 
[02:15:30]  Just ring...  Just zing...  Say stuff like, yeah, like, that's so bad.  Although it is slow.  Speaking of which, I have to say this.  Yeah.  I will have a nuclear meltdown if the rumor is true about Kate Gosselin and Sirius XM.  I've heard things.  I will have a fucking nuclear meltdown.  Oh, I've heard some rumors.  What have you heard?  No one can get fucking raises around here.  Really?  Including ourselves.  Uh-huh.  We're drastically underpaid.  Uh-huh.  And there's a strong rumor they're fucking hiring her. 
[02:16:00]  Oh, for the plan.  The reason her show is going away is because no one's watching that shit anymore.  So why would you then turn around and offer a contract here?  Because she's an agent.  What's wrong with you people?  Is that rumor true?  Dude, that demo is so covered.  I bet her picture will be in all the fucking ads.  Of course.  The reason Kate Plus 8 or whatever the fuck the show is called is going away.  No one is watching.  The audience is literally a tenth of what it was.  They're going to call it Kate Plus 8 listeners. 
[02:16:30]  There you go.  See?  Or Kate Plus 8 million a year.  Yeah.  It's that too.  That's where our money's going.  Another dumb fucking hire.  If it's true.  Is it true?  It's not confirmed.  Maybe it's just her publicity.  Maybe the way Dana and those guys use a possible purchase of G4 to get Fox on board.  Maybe she's using this to negotiate something else.  This is the quote.  This is what everybody's basing this on.  She said, somebody asked her about hosting a SiriusXM satellite radio show.  And she said, I love doing satellite radio tours. 
[02:17:00]  And it's something that a few people have suggested recently.  I must admit, it would be a great way to put my gift of gab to great use.  I'll look into it.  Thanks for the suggestion.  Gift of gab.  That's no room.  All right.  So good.  All right.  All right.  I said a few things back there.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we heard that.  A few things.  A few things back there.  Based on just speculation and rumor and innuendo.  Okay.  If you want, you could listen to Tracy Morgan comment on the Carrie Underwood story again. 
[02:17:30]  That's what I want to hear.  Make you feel better.  I wouldn't put it past them.  No, no, no, no.  I'm sure it will happen.  So far, it's a rumor.  Okay.  Danger and Tracy Morgan in the morning on Froggy.  Danger does an entertainment story.  Tracy contributes what she believes is a conversation starter.  What she believes.  I love how you write this shit.  Somebody else must write it.  I don't know.  Danger is indignant.  Yes, I got a very indignant vibe by his title.  Oh.  All right.  Here we go.  Although I thought it was, there is a certain chemistry. 
[02:18:00]  Oh, yeah.  That I find between.  Like, I get why people listen.  Like, bleach and ammonia.  Right.  Has a certain chemistry, too.  Exactly.  So this Danger Frog, he's growing up as Danger Frog.  Next thing you know, he works on a radio station called Froggy.  That's the perfect fit.  How dangerous could it be, too?  I don't fucking...  And why would Mr. and Mrs. Frog name their son Danger?  It's Frog!  I said Frog.  I know we're in this together, but Jesus, say Frog!  Frog.  This is why I'll never get a job there.  Frog.  How do you say...  What is it when they cut down a tree and then chop it up into pieces? 
[02:18:30]  What are those pieces?  Logs.  Logs?  Logs.  Logs.  Wow, you're fucked up.  England fucked you up, brother.  I really did.  England is...  What's up?  No, it's not.  What's up?  England is a fruit country.  UK in the hizzy.  Yeah.  In the entire country of...  Look into that Euro.  What?  How's that working out, that Euro?  I was there when it was pounds.  All pounds all day long.  Well, it's still pounds over in England.  Where are you at with the football players wearing the damn pink? 
[02:19:00]  I know it's a good cause, but do they have to wear the pink?  Yeah.  They had pink gloves on during the Jets game last night.  What was that for?  The breast cancer thing?  No, I understand what it's for, but why are they going all in and the Jets hats they were  wearing were green and pink?  Well, it's hard to not wear the pink when the pink is pretty much the logo for the cause.  But can't they just have a tiny little pink stripe or something?  Why does it have to be...  But then again, why are they doing their uniforms at all?  If they weren't going to let them wear the classic uniform, why aren't they just not fucking  do it at all?  It looks weird.  Oh, it was baseball.  Yeah, baseball wouldn't allow the Mets to do that. 
[02:19:30]  That fucking scumbag bud.  Yep.  Sealy.  Who cares?  It was a who cares game.  You let them wear their stupid hats to...  For 9-11 you can't, right?  Acknowledge 9-11 people.  Of course you do that.  The football players are the pink, though.  It's really just strange.  Entertainment story.  Tracy contributing nothing.  Danger doesn't give a fuck.  Boy's indignant.  Right.  Nancy Grace denies having a wardrobe malfunction during Nancy Grace. 
[02:20:00]  How can you not have material on Nancy Grace's nipple?  Even on regular radio.  Love the music.  By the way, I love the music.  Oh, they went with the E.T.?  Oh, this is great music.  During Dancing with the Stars Monday night, she says, quote, there was a little bit of  movement, but it did not rise to a wardrobe malfunction.  We've taken every precaution known to man to keep this dress right here.  I'm talking industrial-sized precaution.  Well, and that's the thing.  I was caught. 
[02:20:30]  I was reeled in by the, you know, it's a malfunction.  So I watched the video.  I don't see anything that's a malfunction.  She says, okay, thank you, and moves on to the next story.  Okay, thank you.  He just blew her off.  Danger doesn't want to be with Tracy.  She called it an intimate malfunction.  And who, and why believe what they're telling you?  Fucking Nancy Grace's nipple was on TV.  The freeze frame of it, it's obvious.  It's obvious. 
[02:21:00]  It's her big, nasty nipple sticking out.  It looks like a horrible gravy stain type nipple, but it's a nipple just to say.  Chewed out piece of shit on her fucking chest.  Horrible looking.  You could even play on the fact that she said industrial strength.  Okay, thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Okay.  And what says known to man?  Known to man to make sure it doesn't happen.  There's other things not known to man that you could do to make sure the nipple doesn't  slip out?  Yes.  I don't know.  But again, these are all conversation pieces that could have happened in that break.  Yeah, but in all fairness to these assholes, they probably only got 30 seconds to talk. 
[02:21:30]  And that's why he gave her the, okay, thank you.  Yeah, because they're on the clock, man.  As soon as this fucking danger starts talking, they got 30 fucking seconds.  What's so dangerous about what he sees?  He's not saying anything particularly dangerous.  Hey, he's Danger Frog.  Stop it.  Is that being very dangerous?  Not even close.  Crazy danger going on there.  Actually, he's the opposite.  He's very cautious.  I don't know.  He's extremely, he should be cautious, Frog.  Yeah, he should be looks both way before crossing, Frog.  Exactly.  Wardrobe malfunction talk is not the type of talk that generally goes over well. 
[02:22:00]  He's tentative toad.  It's very, very tentative.  I take yield signs seriously, Frog.  No, he brought up, he brought up the Nancy Grace story.  Well, he did bring it up.  That's dangerous.  They're talking tits there.  Right.  Tits on regular radio.  That's, that's dangerous.  That's crazy.  That's why it's dangerous for us.  Shut that shit down, though, when Tracy got a little excited.  Wouldn't it be great if he just snapped again, like, at the very end?  And she's like, it seemed like a wardrobe malfunction.  And if he said, yeah, that's a pretty nice areola, I wouldn't mind sucking on that till 
[02:22:30]  her head caved in.  That's Danger Frog.  She's like, what?  That's what I didn't mean to say.  That's Danger Frog.  But that's something a Danger Frog would say, Sam.  Absolutely.  It's like a big lily pad nipple.  Even just tie it in.  Yeah, right.  It's like an areola lily pad.  Yeah, exactly.  Like, that's not what the froggy listeners want.  Danger Frog should be saying stuff like, I wish I could hit it with a hatchet.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  You don't think Brooks and Dunn fans would be into that?  No, they're not into that.  They're into Toby Keith talk about how much money he makes.  Yeah.  And no jokes about it. 
[02:23:00]  Well, Danger and Tracy Morgan on Froggy 104.  The chick, Tracy Morgan?  Yes, in PA.  This starts Jocktober.  Yeah.  Our favorite month of the year.  And the dynamic duo does some great material on Biggest Loser before starting today's Pledge  of Allegiance.  You know how every show has a...  They have one bit that they do every morning.  Most shows have a few bits every morning.  This show has one...  I'm sorry, two bits.  Nashville Nugget.  And every morning they do the Pledge of Allegiance. 
[02:23:30]  The actual Pledge of Allegiance?  What do you think?  Do you think it's like a fun thing?  They don't even pump it up.  Do you think it's like a fun thing?  Or do you think it's just some kids in a school literally saying the full Pledge of Allegiance?  No, no.  Or do you think it's like a fun, wacky thing?  I know regular radio is a disaster, but there's not a radio show actually doing the Pledge  of Allegiance every morning.  This is not real.  So it's either like a fun, wacky, crazy thing, or it's just there's actually a class of kids  who do the Pledge of Allegiance.  It's these assholes that...  Every morning. 
[02:24:00]  Every single morning.  It's fun.  I say it's fun.  It's assholes like this that...  Of course no one gives us respect.  But I didn't say which one it was.  No radio guy gets respect because of stupid shows like this doing the Pledge of Allegiance in  the morning.  Danger Frog, come on, it's dangerous.  Right, don't judge it yet because you don't know if it's the...  Did he make it dangerous at all?  Well, again, it could be the fun, wacky thing, or it could be literally just the Pledge of  Allegiance read by children.  It's just the Pledge of Allegiance, you know.  You don't know.  Shut up.  You don't know.  Shut up.  If it's Danger Frog, it's got to be something a little edgy.  It could be.  And Tracy Morgan usually has a little quip to throw in here and there, so you don't know. 
[02:24:30]  And when do we get to hear Danger Frog being dangerous?  Because I haven't heard it yet.  Well, he was kind of revving up the last couple clips.  Uh-huh.  To be dangerous?  Plus, he's going to talk about Biggest Loser here before they get into Pledge of Allegiance.  So, obviously, he's got to go with the fat jokes, right?  One would think.  He does have a joke here.  Fat joke.  Technically.  Oh, boy.  Coming up, the Entertainment Report.  It's about 10 minutes away.  We'll find out who got kicked off Dancing with the Stars, who got kicked off Biggest Loser.  You know there's a...  Another mistake these idiots are doing. 
[02:25:00]  We all have fucking smartphones.  We already know all that info.  Oh, everybody.  Well, we even say it on our show.  It's mostly just to get, you know, a conversation started.  Plus, you know...  He's teasing who's getting kicked off Dancing with the Stars.  If you care about the show, you already know.  And you know you're a creative show when you name your entertainment report The Entertainment Report.  Yes.  I hope these guys...  You don't want questions.  No.  See, we're trying to teach them, too.  Yeah.  We beat the shit out of them, but we're also trying to teach them to do radio properly.  You don't tease stuff like that anymore.  It's a service. 
[02:25:30]  It's almost impossible.  I'm a huge Jets fan.  Every once in a while, I'm out doing shit, and I'm trying to avoid the game.  It's impossible at this point.  Yeah.  You got to stay off Twitter.  You got to stay off everything.  Yeah.  People are talking about it as you're walking around, because they're getting updates.  You know what I mean?  Usually when you're out in public, and you...  Yeah.  And let's say you want to avoid the Jets or the Yankees game, for that matter, right?  Sure.  So now you're in the real world with the other people trying to avoid the game.  And then they're going to all go home, and hopefully, like, you know, they have it on tape or whatever, DVR, and then they're going to watch it. 
[02:26:00]  And watch it without it being spurled.  But nowadays, all the people out in public are getting the updates and discussing it.  Yes.  It's impossible.  The Froggy listeners go solely to Froggy for their information.  Yes.  Coming up, the Entertainment Report.  It's about 10 minutes away.  We'll find out who got kicked off Dancing with the Stars, who got kicked off Biggest Loser.  You know, there's a country singer on Biggest Loser this year.  Yes.  Big Vinny of Trailer Choir.  Yeah.  They had that hit song, Rockin' the Beer Gut.  Yeah. 
[02:26:30]  Which is...  Kind of ironic that he's on Biggest Loser.  Yeah.  Why is that ironic, you stupid bitch?  Well, because he had a big hit with Rockin' the Beer Gut.  Don't spoil their joke.  Don't you dare.  It's not ironic, because that was from the past, and now he's changing his life.  It's not ironic.  I said they had a joke about the Biggest Loser.  I don't want you guys spoiling it.  I almost did, I think.  What, you know the joke?  No.  Don't spoil this joke.  I don't know anything about these two idiots. 
[02:27:00]  I think I know what the joke is.  All right, Jimmy, take a stab at it.  I predict he's going to say he shouldn't be on the Biggest Loser, because his stomach  is filled with cum and shit.  That's what he's going to say.  Come on.  Sam, what is...  I think you nailed it.  What's wrong with the cum on?  That's dangerous.  But it's not frog related.  His name is Danger Frog.  But the froggy listeners don't want to hear that.  It's Danger Frog.  Froggy.  The froggy listeners don't want to hear that.  Froggy.  Froggy.  Froggy.  It's froggy.  Froggy. 
[02:27:30]  The Beer Gut?  Yeah.  Which is...  Kind of ironic.  That he's on the Biggest Loser.  Yeah, he has a beer gut.  Yeah.  He's trying to lose it, too.  I hope he does.  I hope he didn't get kicked off last night.  We got the details.  But first, it's time for the Pledge of Allegiance, brought to you by DPS.  Doesn't he know?  I hope he didn't get kicked off.  You don't know the answer to that?  What are you looking at?  What are you, hiding it from yourself?  Yeah.  Fucking cunt.  Plus, it's also nice to know that they are indeed reading off a paper that Danger Frog didn't  go and watch the show or anything like that to tell you about it.  Yeah, no, no, no, no. 
[02:28:00]  I fucking hate Radio T's.  Hate it.  They're just the right deal.  Like, ooh, we'll keep people through the fucking shit.  Through the asshole.  Just say it.  You're right there.  Yeah.  Yeah, there you go.  Yeah, the big entertainment report.  Who's sticking around for that?  For the big entertainment report.  Who the fuck is waiting for that?  I am.  Yeah, I know it too.  I just raised my hand.  You could read a newspaper.  You could go on Twitter.  You could go on a website.  But none of those things are...  Ho-hum.  They're not frog related.  No.  Could someone explain to me, if you are into Dance with the Stars, what it would take for  not to know the info 24 hours later. 
[02:28:30]  Not 24.  What would it be?  12 hours later?  12 hours.  Because there's nothing to do with the frog.  The frog has to be the one.  Oh, the frog.  For some reason, you went to bed early when they were kicking off one of those dopey dancers.  First thing you would do when you woke up is find out, right?  Go to it.  Because you like the show.  Not if you have dial-up internet.  Callback.  That is true.  Dial-up internet.  It's pretty good, but it is slow.  But it's good.  But it's good.  Out of their audience, give a fuck about that show.  How many actually care to find out who got kicked off? 
[02:29:00]  Probably zero.  I would say, yeah.  I would say probably zero.  So this is another waste of time thing that regular radio does.  Play a fucking song there.  If you think that's a waste of time.  Oh, boy.  Make room for the Pledge of Allegiance.  All right.  Yeah, but they're going to do something with it.  I know.  Okay.  I have faith in radio.  Little faith, but they're not going to just do the Pledge of Allegiance.  But first, it's time for the Pledge of Allegiance, brought to you by DPS Penn, with you from the beginning. 
[02:29:30]  Hi, I'm Jackson McKee from Mrs. Hickey's Kindergarten Class, South Butler Primary School.  Here's the Pledge of Allegiance.  I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America,  and to the republic for which it stands,  one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
[02:30:00]  All are famous.  Hop and go traffic.  Enos, you are never to blame.  Be more funny.  So...  Where's the joke?  You cut off the joke, I think.  No, as you can see, I left on the sweeper for hop and go traffic.  Hop and go traffic.  Oh, no, it's progrelated.  Hop and go traffic follows the Pledge of Allegiance.  It was actually option B.  This is unbelievable. 
[02:30:30]  It was just the Pledge of Allegiance read by children.  It was option B.  And they do that every day?  That's every morning.  And then, you know...  Yeah, it's sponsored, so...  It'll get back to Danger Frog and Tracy Morgan,  we're making fun of them, and they'll get all pissed off.  But listen to yourselves.  Exactly.  There's nothing here.  Are we really wrong?  No, we're not even trying.  Right.  We haven't even really pumped up these clips.  They're so bad.  But they literally just play kids doing the Pledge of Allegiance.  Yeah, they just...  The kids do...  They record the kids saying the Pledge of Allegiance, 
[02:31:00]  and then they go back and they play it on the radio.  Because it's local.  Yeah.  It's local.  The local angle.  And people that are patriotic, listening to country music, like it.  And parents sit, and they're like, aww, aww.  And they're trying...  It's got the aww factor.  Like, my mom used to listen to country music when we had country music on the radio in New York.  Oh, great.  And I'm sure, when I was growing up, she would be, every single day, submitting my class for the Pledge of Allegiance.  Oh, I'm sure she would. 
[02:31:30]  And that's the audience they're catering to.  Fucking creepy, that mother of yours.  Because this is entertainment.  Yeah.  This guy has got to be in hell, though.  You don't think he's, like, enjoying this as he's doing it?  He's got to hate it.  Do you think when Danger Frog got into radio, he wanted to be doing this?  With Tracy Morgan?  With Tracy Morgan.  Well, yeah, he wanted to do it with Tracy Morgan.  The Tracy Morgan.  You know how excited he got when they said, look, we hired, and they said Tracy Morgan.  He was like, oh, fuck, we're going national.  Oh, shit.  We're going national.  This is huge. 
[02:32:00]  And then some big fat woman walks.  Yeah, she is.  What does she look like?  Nobody can find any pictures.  I can't find pictures.  That is not good.  I think she's a pig?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  No, no, no.  Are there any station event photos?  No, she's not mentioned on the site anywhere.  Nowhere.  What?  Like, I scoured the site.  Wow.  I can't even Google her.  Her name doesn't show up anywhere.  How about fucking, is she spelled it wrong?  The only reason we know who she is is because Danger Frog says, hey, it's Danger Frog and Tracy  Morgan.  How about you look at his Twitter?  Go to the Twitter.  You might find it through Twitter.  He's the only plug in his show that he does in the afternoon. 
[02:32:30]  Who does he follow?  But he has another show he does?  How many followers does he have?  Danger Frog.  He's got 766 followers.  Who is this motherfucker?  He has to do two radio shows?  Well, I think he was filling in for the morning.  Like, they have the afternoon guy do the morning show as well.  As they should.  Danger Froggy.  What's his Twitter?  By the way, Danger Froggy is his Twitter.  But his name, he gave it away, is Jeremy Mulder. 
[02:33:00]  But it's Jeremy Danger Mulder.  I guess Danger is his middle name.  I got it.  Danger is his middle name.  That's good.  I like that.  What's dangerous about him?  Like, he seems to be a nice enough guy, but he's not particularly dangerous.  He was probably like a rock jock somewhere, and Danger was his middle name.  And then he got the job offer from Froggy, so they said, we're going to change your name  to Danger Frog.  Danger Frog.  We don't want to give up that danger. 
[02:33:30]  You've already branded the danger thing.  And we got the frog thing, so I'm thinking Danger Frog.  Danger Frog.  Makes no sense.  And he's just like, yeah, okay.  Just try to get a picture.  Whatever, just pay me.  I do feel bad for a lot of these radio guys.  See if he's following Tracy Morgan.  Well, he's got 700.  He's following 700.  He has the same amount of followers as he does people he's following, so either way  you go.  He follows Jimmy Kimmel.  Wow. 
[02:34:00]  Someone just go, like, do an at-mention search for Tracy Morgan.  Try her name a few different ways.  T-R-A-C-Y.  T-R-A-C-I.  T-R-A-C-E-Y.  Who is this bitch?  Who is this bitch?  Why can't you find no Tracy Morgan?  Where is she hiding?  I can't find her.  You can try hiding under a motherfucking lily pan.  No, it comes up Tracy Morgan.  Yeah, of course it does.  Yeah, that's hard.  Well, how about you put it in motherfucking quotes, and then you quote Danger Frog, mister?  Because they won't come up in the same Google search. 
[02:34:30]  Yeah, I would put, like, Tracy Morgan and Danger Frog.  Yeah, but don't...  You've got to put quotes around them motherfuckers.  Who is this bitch?  Who is she?  Uh, your last track, uh...  Oh, yeah.  Well, this is like...  You guys said that he's in hell doing this radio show, because this is not what he intended.  This, uh, screamed at me that he gets one break per show where he's allowed to do what he wants.  Whoa.  A little riffing?  Right.  And, Obi, I don't know, you were doing radio for a long time on the rock stations before Ant came along. 
[02:35:00]  Did you ever have to save phone calls that you liked so you could redo jokes based on those phone calls?  What?  You know what I mean?  You know how you record phone calls?  Yeah, we used to...  Me and Ant used to record the phone calls, too.  Sure.  Did you ever...  We had to.  Because people might curse.  ...the phone call?  We saved phone calls all the time.  But did you play it, and then save it for days, thinking, in a few days, I'll use this joke on this phone call again?  Yeah.  Because I... 
[02:35:30]  Okay.  I kind of did that.  Okay.  That's what I...  And then I would make believe it was coming in for the first time.  Right.  Okay.  And you're at the point...  I'm guilty of that.  You're at the point in your career where you can admit your mistakes.  I'm guilty of that.  And you admit that you did this.  I would make believe it was coming in live, man, at that moment.  Hey.  And then someone would always call, like, dude, you played that three days ago.  Nah.  Nah.  That's what you're talking about.  Same guy.  They would call in and call you out on it?  And then I'd be like, look, man, don't tell anyone.  What song you want to hear?  I'll sneak it in.  Someone who's experienced as you, I need you to tell me, number one, is this a live phone 
[02:36:00]  call?  And number two, is the joke something that he thought of days ago when the phone call originally  came in?  Or is it a live phone call and he's just riffing?  Riffing.  Okay.  You tell me.  Yeah.  Because I don't know for sure.  All right.  I'm young.  Without hearing the call, it's not a live phone call.  Oh.  And the joke wasn't on the spot.  Oh.  I probably thought about it at his house.  Wrote it down.  Wrote it down.  I'm going to save this phone call.  I know I'll think of some joke for it.  It's going to be great.  Why don't you patch things together? 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  Let's hear it.  I have a feeling it's live.  It may be live.  Because it's Danger Frog.  It's not some lock jock.  It's written here, Danger takes a fake call that he probably took days ago so he can make  a layaway joke.  You know, layaway.  Yeah, yeah.  Layaway.  Layaway.  Kind of sat there.  Froggy in the morning.  It's 719.  You know, not just, not are we only broadcasters here, but sometimes we're counsel.  Oh, really?  Are you?  Not a high broad.  Not a, not a, not a, not a, not a, we only not broadcast. 
[02:37:00]  Even when he got it out, it was not are we only broadcasters.  I'm going to, I'm going to add not.  Broadcasters here, but sometimes we're counselors.  Therapists.  As I tell Jimmy all the time, I'm not a counselor, but I stayed at a Super 8 motel last night.  Oh, Super 8.  Yes.  Big.  What the fuck does that mean?  It's a Holiday Inn Express.  Isn't that the commercial?  Super 8.  I'm not that smart, but I guess Super 8's a sponsor, so.  What?  So they, they stole the Holiday Inn Express slogan? 
[02:37:30]  What happened?  What happened here?  No, I don't know at all.  They're laughing just by saying Super 8.  Why you laugh?  Why you laugh?  Why you laugh for?  Why you laugh for?  It's supposed to be a Holiday Inn Express commercial where they go, ah.  Maybe she's just stupid.  I'm not that smart.  She stinks.  No, I'm not a brain surgeon, but I stayed at a Holiday Inn Express last night.  Yeah, because I don't see Super 8 advertised anywhere on this website.  No.  So maybe she's just.  She's just fucked up.  An idiot.  She's just an idiot.  You think so?  No, she's riffing, man. 
[02:38:00]  She's Tracy Morgan.  She fucked up.  You think she's fucked up?  She fucked up.  Therapists.  As I tell Jimmy all the time, I'm not a counselor, but I stayed at a Super 8 motel last night.  Oh, Super 8.  Yes.  Big spender.  Denise in Greensburg is on the froggy phone.  The thing with these guys is the fact that the chemistry is such magic.  Wow.  It's hard not to enjoy the organic back and flow between them.  You've got to hear that again, because she gave the wrong reference, but he didn't get  the joke at all.  He didn't get the joke at all.  He thought the joke was that she didn't spend a lot of money on a hotel, which has nothing 
[02:38:30]  to do with being a counselor.  Being smart or a counselor.  It doesn't make any sense.  No, it makes none sense.  This is Jagger and Richards, man.  I don't know what you fuckers are talking about.  Are they even in the same country while they're doing this show?  This sounds so fucking...  Like everything's lost in translation.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Super 8.  Big spender.  I'll laugh at that.  Why?  Denise in Greensburg is on the froggy phone.  She needs something.  What's up, Denise? 
[02:39:00]  Oh, I'm just having oh so much fun.  What happened?  Oh, my bad brother's acting up again.  You can get that removed.  Yeah, I'm going to next Tuesday.  When I moved to Pittsburgh, I started drinking Iron City beer and eating hot wings every  night, and then I had to have my gallbladder removed like two weeks later.  It's pretty amazing.  I hope you have it.  Oh, my God.  Actually put a liver on layaway.  You have it?  Good luck with your gallbladder surgery, Denise. 
[02:39:30]  Seriously.  See, there you go.  We're therapists again.  Someone worried about their...  Holy shit.  And I'll break it down.  They can't even do the basics right.  No.  Oh, my God.  Because they're trying to make believe it was a live phone call, but he left in the part  at the end where she started the liver line, but then that's cut off because the fucking  phone call was done.  Did you hear the fucking...  Let me hear that again.  You can hear the start in the background.  Because, look, you should also listen...  Look, at least...  All right, look.  It's horrible, but at least get the basics right.  Okay, if we're going to make believe there's a live phone call, then make sure it's edited 
[02:40:00]  properly.  Yeah, yeah.  And listen, you'll hear it.  You are, man.  Good luck with your gallbladder surgery, Denise.  Seriously.  See, there you go.  We're therapists again.  Someone...  Liver on layaway.  They cut her off in the middle of liver on layaway.  She did it again.  That's a quick edit.  It's a terrible joke that she tried to repeat, and then she repeated again.  But fuck it up.  Then it fucks it up, and it doesn't sound like a live phone call.  That's just basic radio shit. 
[02:40:30]  And the reason you could tell that it was done days ago is because they probably were  doing some kind of advice thing days ago.  But they set up...  They needed to play this again.  We're counselors sometimes for some kind of context.  Yeah.  Because the caller called up and said, I got to talk about my gallbladder again, or something  like that.  She referenced to it not being the first...  And everybody listening is like, huh?  Yeah.  But then once the liver on layaway line comes through...  That's the gold...  That's the gold right there.  All is saved.  That's the golden nugget.  I have to piss.  I'll be right back. 
[02:41:00]  I can't hold it.  Oh, make wee wee.  I have to go badly.  I got to pee, too.  Oh, you want to break real quick or a single?  Because I have to piss so bad I can't say that.  We're going to break in a minute or two.  All right.  I'll be done.  Go make weebies.  All right.  This is the end of the clip.  See, there you go.  We're therapists again.  Someone...  Liver on layaway.  Worried about their gallbladder surgery.  You start paying on it now?  We were able to tell them that it's...  Her that it's going to be just fine.  Sarah Evans coming up next.  So don't worry.  So don't worry.  Yeah, because everything has to be good and nice in the end.  Yeah, yeah.  We were able to tell her everything's going to be just fine.  Don't, don't... 
[02:41:30]  We're joking about a medical issue, but we're sorry about it.  We're careful.  Please.  No letters.  They don't want one letter to come in.  Leave it to Danger Frog to have to apologize after another one of his crazy bits.  Oh, boy.  That's what he said.  That's true.  How many apologies must he go through a week?  I mean, he is dangerous.  Dangerous.  It's his middle name, by the way.  As far as frogs go.  I think that's it for today.  You know...  That is a great kickoff.  What's funny about Jacktober is that you guys always start the month saying,  We love Jacktober. 
[02:42:00]  It's our favorite month of the year.  But by the end of the first week or two, neither of you want to look at me.  No.  You can't stay on the segment.  You hate Jacktober, and you want to quit the business altogether.  Well, because what happens is it just becomes really sad.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I feel sad for those people.  You just see people on radio that have not achieved where they want to be, their dreams.  Like, he doesn't want some stupid hole doing a show with them.  Oh, God, no.  And then eventually you realize you're in the same business.  And he wants to be a little dangerous. 
[02:42:30]  He does.  Maybe not to the level we are, but he wants to be a little dangerous, having a name like Danger Frog.  It's his middle name.  Yeah.  It's just sad.  But, I mean, I would like to...  This used to be a great business, and it's just sad what it's become.  I would like to keep track of when...  Everything has to be ridiculously safe.  ...your emotions go from happy about Jacktober, which you still are today...  Yeah.  ...to being first sad and then vehemently angry about it.  Yes.  ...just upset that it exists or any of it is happening.  So angry. 
[02:43:00]  She's exactly like every other woman we've featured in Jacktober.  And we've never featured this station before.  This is the fourth year of Jacktober, I think.  Right, Eric?  The fourth year of Jacktober.  God bless.  And we've never featured this station, and it's another...  Are we going to do a whole montage this year?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, good.  She's made it already.  All right, good.  Oh, yeah, she's got to be in.  And, I mean, some of our old favorite shows will be back for Jacktober.  Scott and Todd?  Scott and Todd.  It's not Jacktober without Scott and Todd. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah, absolutely.  And some of our favorite segments will be back, except featured on other shows.  What?  Yes.  Yes.  Oh, man, what a twist.  So the show will be a new show.  I have to make a request for Jacktober.  But the segment is the same segment.  We're not doing The Fugitive, please.  Do not give me any Fugitive audio.  No, I'm serious.  Not yet.  Just don't do it.  The month is young, though, and I'm going to tell you, if anybody knows where The Fugitive  is, just leave it on the Facebook page. 
[02:44:00]  I'm somebody that you have seen.  I go around and...  Wow, Eric, the Fugitive just called again, right on schedule.  I think we traced his call.  And don't forget, a call from The Fugitive coming up at five after the hour.  It's like, what?  How do you know?  I just think if you're going to do some of that hacky shit, you could do it in a way  where it's sort of more believable.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  Instead of just totally just fucking go with the format. 
[02:44:30]  Ah.  You think they're hacky?  Ah.  I told you were out of the room.  I feel just bad for these people.  You know, Danger Frog wants to be a little dangerous.  And you know he doesn't want to be working with that broad.  Yeah, she's fucking horrible.  Who's adding nothing?  There's a few broads out there that add shit on radio, but this Tracy Morgan isn't one  of them.  No.  And I'm not going to load up the end of Jocktober with old favorites this year like I've  done in the past.  Ah.  This week we'll have an old favorite.  John and Jeff? 
[02:45:00]  I'm not making any promises about what this week holds, but we will have an old favorite  this week.  You know, I just forgot.  I got a haircut at a new place because my guy was busy, and it always comes in the small  talk, what do you do for a living?  And I said, broadcast, do a radio show, right?  I swear to God, I just remember this.  He goes, oh, really?  What show?  I go, oh, I'm John from John and Jeff.  I swear to God.  Oh, I never heard of that show.  Yeah, you know, we're, because I, I just hate, you know, we're trying, we're trying. 
[02:45:30]  I hate getting in a conversation about our show with people, so it's like, ah, I do a  show, I'm John from John and Jeff.  We're working on it, you know, trying to get our name out there.  Just talking to the third shifters.  Because then they, then they move on.  We're two guys.  Yeah.  Then they move on to the weather or something instead of like wanting to just talk the  whole time about, you know.  Yeah.  Dumb radio show.  We're two guys who believe rain should only fall on weekdays.  Yeah.  Was that one of them?  No, but that's the kind of.  That is perfect.  Do we have a John and Jeff thing?  It's their non-rebellious stuff that they have. 
[02:46:00]  Like, we believe.  A John and Jeff-ism.  That guilty people should pay the price.  Yeah.  It's all terrible stuff that's who gives a shit.  We're two guys that believe if you did the crime, you should do the time.  Whoa, watch out.  Hey, look out.  We're two guys who believe that yielding doesn't mean stopping.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  Look out, look out.  I think John should change his last name to Danger.  Yeah.  Danger Jeff.  Danger John.  Danger Jeff. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah, they should be the Danger duo.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  And then all of a sudden, he's in Thailand.  He does like Thailand.  We know what happens in Thailand.  Oh, people go there for the scenery.  For the beaches, I hear.  They sure do.  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  The hairless scenery.  Look at him in Thailand.  Oh, God.  He looks guilty.  He just looks guilty standing there.  Mug shot.  Yeah.  These are the make-believe.  Look, Noah was checking out the local fire.  Do you have to take one day when you go to Thailand and visit a bunch of places so you  can get pictures in front of them? 
[02:47:00]  No, it's ten minutes on your way to the fucking spot.  You just go a different way every day, and you get a picture in front of the cafe, and  a picture right around the corner.  There's child slavery.  In front of some fucking temple or something, and then, yeah.  Yes.  Right to the kids.  Yeah.  Right around the corner.  You'll take any picture as you want.  It's okay.  Yeah, here you go.  That's for the family that, you know, back home that is asking some questions behind your  back.  What happened to you in Thailand?  Look at this beautiful golden temple.  The architecture.  It's just amazing.  It's really just amazing. 
[02:47:30]  Oh, and their local food.  Oh, my God.  The fucking farmer's market.  Oh, my God.  It's just amazing.  Oh, and the tight little assholes.  I mean the, whoa.  I mean the calamari I had last night.  Yes, yes.  Oh, man.  The way they make it over there is just unbelievable.  Get the fuck out of here.  If you go to Thailand, nine out of ten of you are doing some weird shit.  Shenanigans.  Or he-nanigans.  Oh, ho.  So he might be the one out of ten that isn't.  That's all I'm saying.  Maybe.  Because I don't fucking know shit about this. 
[02:48:00]  I don't know what he does over there in Thailand.  I do.  I'm very suspicious.  I know what other people do in Thailand.  Every time someone tells you they went to Thailand, you always have to put your head  down because you don't want your talent.  You're like, oh, how do you book a flight to Thailand and not let anyone know?  Like, do you have to go somewhere first?  And then once you get there, then you go to Thailand, tell people, yeah, I'm going to  fucking, you know.  Right.  I'm going to Vietnam.  Wouldn't you just pick a country that's close by and no one's going to check on you?  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  What's close by? 
[02:48:30]  What's a safe place next to Thailand where you can tell your family and friends that's  where you're going?  Cambodia?  Yeah.  Is Vietnam near there?  Vietnam.  At least Vietnam, you could say, because that has become a tourist trap.  You go in the tunnels and do all sorts of shit.  How about Myanmar?  Going to Colonel Kurtz's house.  Yeah.  Celebrate Halloween.  Oh, Burma's pretty far from it.  Burma, you could get away with.  You could tell your family you're going to Burma.  Is that close?  A little too far?  Where's Thailand over there on that map?  Yeah, right here.  There's Bangkok.  Where's Thailand?  Right here, where the arrow is.  You could go to Cambodia if you want to, you know, check out the Khmer Rouge skull caves. 
[02:49:00]  Oh, they have them?  Oh, fuck yeah.  Yeah.  And then Vietnam, but that's still kind of far.  I would check out Vietnam.  Fuck that.  You can go to Burma, old school Burma.  Yeah.  What's just to the south of like Bangkok?  What is that little strip?  Malaysia?  Yeah, Malaysia.  Singapore is kind of far.  Malaysia is pretty fucking dangerous, though.  There's a lot of Muslims there.  Yeah, I don't know why you would go there unless you wouldn't have sex with children. 
[02:49:30]  Laos?  You could fly into Laos.  Laos?  Laos.  Yeah.  I don't know.  You know what?  That Southeast Asia is a corner of shit.  It really is just a kid fucking area of the world.  But there's beautiful scenery there.  Why don't we go and take it over?  Culture.  Oh, culture?  A lot of culture.  Yeah, let's check out the fucking Ho Chi Minh Trail.  Where's Ho Chi Minh? 
[02:50:00]  Yeah, Ho Chi Minh City.  What did it used to be called there, Sam?  Back in the old Vietnam days?  I don't know.  Oh, God.  Ho Chi Minh Trail?  No, Ho Chi Minh City.  Did it me lie?  That was Saigon.  Oh.  Saigon.  Did they change the name of Saigon?  Oh, yeah, they did.  Oh, the second they stormed over that border, when the last chopper left.  That's not Saigon.  It didn't.  Saigon was gone.  I didn't know Saigon was no longer called Saigon.  I didn't know that.  Yeah.  Ho Chi Minh City.  We should take a break.  And thank you for that, Sam.  Who do we feature tomorrow? 
[02:50:30]  We're going to go to one of two cities.  I haven't decided yet.  What kind of show are you deciding on?  It's between a very holey show.  Like, not holey, but the whole is very much a whole.  Like, not like a whole hole.  That just had some whole, what?  Yeah, like, she was just not a talented broadcaster.  Right.  Whereas this is like a whole and a gay guy, also.  Oh, well. 
[02:51:00]  Girl, gay.  Or we could do a...  I don't think we do girl, gay, guy combos.  Girl, gay, guy, guy.  Girl, gay, guy, guy?  Right.  So it's almost like two holes.  Almost two holes, yeah.  Or we could go and visit a hip-hop station.  Why would a hip-hop station be good?  Hip-hop on...  They almost keep it real, hip-hop stations.  No, they don't.  No?  No, they don't.  They don't?  Nope.  They trick you.  They stink, too.  But they do not keep it real.  Okay.  I don't think they stink as much, but they do stink. 
[02:51:30]  When we get back, because we tease stuff here.  Oh.  What are we doing?  We don't have to, but...  We have a new Good Boy Phone, Naughty Boy Phone song.  Oh.  For James P. Morton.  Oh, there's a good boy phone and a naughty boy phone.  My naughty boy's phone and my good boy's phone.  And I'm going with Jimmy's Logic.  Why wait while we can play it right now for everybody?  Absolutely.  Why not?  Uh, we had, uh, Sully from Godsmack do one for you.  Yes.  And guess what? 
[02:52:00]  Sebastian Bach.  Ah!  Naughty Boy Phone.  Ah!  Good Boy Phone.  That's great. 
[02:52:30]  Fuck, I want to hear more of that.  He's got a great voice, huh?  He's amazing.  Sebastian Bach.  Troy said he was going for a cock rock type of vibe.  That was some cock rock.  Yeah.  I wish he had a scream or something, but that's good, man.  Fucking Sebastian Bach could sing.  That worked, definitely.  All right.  Andy Rooney signed off.  Talk about that next, I guess.  Oh, good old Andy.  Never know!  No, I didn't. 
[02:53:00]  Not only did I not notice, I don't care.  Right, not a once.  You old doddering fool.  You ever notice the stares you get when your diapers smell like shit in the office?  Goey.  Fugitive, can I ask you, what borough of New York do you live in now?  I live in Queens. 
[02:53:30]  What's happening, Fugitive?  Yeah, what happened, Fugitive?  No, nothing, nothing.  I actually, the dog had just walked a little bit too cute.  The dog walked a little bit too cute.  What's up, baby?  You want to get some dirty talk going? 
[02:54:00]  Yeah, that's it.  I'm going to give some cyber sex.  I'm good.  I'm going to lay your back or something.  And I'm going to lick all the way down your neck like this.  I'm going to take my tongue and just go like...  I'm going to clean out your ears or something and get wax on my tongue and then lick all the way down your neck.  Oh, that's a nice, dark nipple.  I wouldn't mind getting some nook out of that.  And then I'm going to get my tongue and I'm going to start flicking it all over your nipples so much that you start coming. 
[02:54:30]  You're going to cum so much that your shoes are going to make sloshy noises.  And I'm going to get down there and just start licking your fucking cuda really good.  I'll just, I'll open up your cuda.  I got, I got like long nails on my middle fingers.  So I'll dig my nails into your cuda lips and I'll open them up and I'll just go like...  And I'll get in there until you cum so many times or whatever.  I'll stick it right in you too.  I'll climb right up on you like you're rebuilding or something. 
[02:55:00]  I'm going to climb on like you're a tree or something and just cram my oats in you.  Put a finger in my ass.  That's a good boy's phone and his nutty boy's phone.  I'm not here by his phone and his good boy's phone.  That's a good boy's phone and his nutty boy's phone.  I'm not here by his phone and his good boy's phone. 
[02:55:30]  That's a good boy's phone and his nutty boy's phone.  That's a good boy's phone and his nutty boy's phone.  That's a good boy's phone and his nutty boy's phone and his nutty boy's phone and his nutty boy's phone. 
[02:56:00]  That's a good boy's phone and his nutty boy's phone and his nutty boy's phone and his nutty boy's phone and his nutty boy's phone and his nutty boy's phone and his nutty boy's phone and his nutty boy's phone and his nutty boy's phone and his nutty boy's phone and his nutty boy's phone and his nutty boy's phone and his nutty boy's phone and his nutty boy's phone and his nutty boy's phone and his nutty boy's phone and his nutty boy's phone and his nutty boy's phone and his nutty boy's phone and his nutty boy's phone and his nutty boy's phone and his nutty boy's phone.  The Virus.  Sirius XM.  This is the OPN Anthony Show. 
[02:56:30]  Cool video of a bunch of guys propelling down the Washington Monument.  Yeah, they're trying to fix it, I guess, or at least assess the damage.  And it brought back a memory.  I was telling you, when we were used to working in Boston,  we did some gig in the city, maybe Newbury Comics or something, Tower Records.  It might have been for one of our CD signings, now that I think about it.  And somebody that came to the signing or this thing we were doing goes,  hey, you want to come back to the fraternity house?  So me and I, yeah, what the fuck, we'll go. 
[02:57:00]  We'll have a few beers or whatever.  I think they said they were having a party.  And we go there, and these guys, these lunatics,  are propelling down the side of the building, getting all fucked up,  and then they were propelling.  Remember when the chicks were doing it and stuff?  I do barely remember.  It was like a three- or four-story building, I think.  And they were just propelling down into the street.  Or repelling.  Repelling, sorry.  Yes, if you're propelling.  Sorry, you're right.  I just see it popping up here.  Sorry, fuck.  I deserve it.  The crowd goes wild. 
[02:57:30]  What did you say?  I said propelling.  It's repelling.  Fuck.  What's wrong with that?  One's going down the side of the building?  If you repel with one of those propeller hats.  I'm embarrassed.  Why?  Now.  I don't feel too good about myself right now.  I have this nice story, and I can't even say the word properly.  So what?  Maybe you're on a boat, and you saw a fish you caught in the repeller.  Repelling, yes.  Didn't somebody we were with try it?  That looks crazy.  Look at that.  That's a little high.  That's the Washington Monument? 
[02:58:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Fair enough.  That does look great.  That's just high up, man.  That looks fucked up.  You're right.  Because I was saying to these guys, I would do that.  Now that I'm seeing this video, get the fuck.  No way.  Well, who's that a worker?  Now, who's going out the window looking?  They're checking to make sure what kind of damage it has?  Is that what's going on?  Yeah, from the earthquake.  You saw the earthquake video from inside?  Yeah, from inside.  That's pretty good.  That thing was shaking.  You see that person?  I think it was a woman.  Give up her post.  Like, fuck this.  I'm out of here.  I'm leaving.  Was it shaking, the whole thing?  Did you see the video?  No.  Really shaking. 
[02:58:30]  Show me, Sam.  Please?  Yeah.  That was last week, I think.  I didn't see it.  Everyone was checking out this video.  Here, the security camera from inside when that earthquake hit.  What, he got a nice still picture?  Video shows inside Washington Monument as quake strikes.  There it goes.  There it is.  Look at it.  It's shaking.  And that worker, is there a woman in?  What floor is she on, I wonder?  Pretty high up.  Oh, she's up there.  She's like, what?  That's horrifying, because that just did a tip over.  There's nowhere to go. 
[02:59:00]  You're in a dumb needle.  Yeah, fuck that.  Look at it.  It's shaking.  And the woman's like, fuck that.  I'm out of here.  Everyone just starts running, and then some debris starts falling.  It shakes more and more.  Isn't that unbelievable?  A lot of dust and debris.  I've never been up there.  What, do you have to walk to the top, or is there an elevator?  I've never been up there.  I would assume there's a tiny little elevator.  You think?  Because Coit Tower in San Francisco has a little elevator.  I want to go to the Washington Monument and wave at people.  Everybody's trying to get down from there.  Everyone wants to get down from there. 
[02:59:30]  I would imagine it has a little elevator now.  Maybe a little six-person, eight-person elevator.  I don't know.  They're all walking down the steps.  It is pretty thin, right?  Are you allowed?  What do you do up there?  Just look and get out?  What do you think you do up there?  Go in.  It's a monument.  What else can you do up there?  Every few floors, there's probably a plaque with some history on it.  Yes.  You have to make it more than it really is.  Steve Myrtleberry once colonized a fruit tree.  Oh, fuck him.  Steve Myrtleberry.  You assholes.  You think they have something like 200 feet to the top, 150 to the top. 
[03:00:00]  You are now the height you would be at if, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a factoid.  People are saying it's not even rappel.  It's rappel.  R-A-P-P-E-L.  Right.  So rappel is to push away.  Like bug repellent.  So rappel is wrong, too.  It's rappel.  All right.  Rappel.  All right, Joe in Albany.  Yeah, what's Joe doing?  He's acting like Albany's the king or something.  Holla!  Tired.  Russell Simmons says he thinks rich people need to be taxed more.  How about all these rich people just start handing over their money then? 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  We'll follow your lead.  I don't want to be lumped in with all you guys that have, like, a lot more money than I do, by the way.  That's all.  I'm sure Russell Simmons really has a fuck, fuck load of money.  So did he write a check?  I'm doing very well, believe me.  But I don't have Russell Simmons money.  So don't lump me into the same fucking category.  But my point, when he says something like this, is he following it up with a check, like, and here you go?  Yeah, there you go. 
[03:01:00]  Give as much as you want.  I'm sure he does a lot for charity.  I think he's one of those type of guys.  Give as much as you want.  I think he's one of those guys.  We've had him on a couple of times, and I see him in public, and it's like, these guys don't even remember you.  I just hate radio sometimes.  I know.  It's like, I know we help these guys promote nicely.  Like, we give great plugs.  We sold some books.  You know what I mean?  He was in for his book.  And then you see them out, and they're just like, ah, they don't even remember you.  Yeah.  $340 million Russell Simmons is worth?  Yeah.  Wow.  That's at least $40 million more than me. 
[03:01:30]  If you had $340 million, how much would you give back to charity or something?  He should give up $240 million.  There.  There.  Yes, he did give Sam $100 for the TV.  Wow, what a guy.  I do remember that.  What a guy.  How many times would he have to do that to break even and have no more money left?  How many $100 bills does he have?  $340 million?  Yeah, so how many hundreds is that? 
[03:02:00]  Anyone know the math on that?  30.  10 per 1,000.  $340 million.  $34,000.  You're going to go with $34,100 bills?  I don't know.  $340,000.  He's got $340,100 bills.  Is that what you're going with?  I think so.  Oh, Sam, you're not going to free this house.  $340,000.  You don't even know how to say frog properly.  No, $1,000 bills. 
[03:02:30]  He has $340,000.  So he's got $3,400,000 bills.  How many nickels does he have?  He has $340,000 bills.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's got $3.4 million, $100,000 bills.  Holy shit.  So he could give $100 to...  To $3.4 million people? 
[03:03:00]  To everyone in the United States and still have money left.  What?  He could give $100 to everyone in the United States and still have money left over.  He's got $3.4 million, $100 bills.  Oh, sorry.  Right?  You're right.  $3.4 million.  He could give a dollar.  So he could give $100 to half the people in Manhattan.  No, $3.4 million, $100 bills.  Because $100 times $3.4 is $340.  Yeah.  So no, you're right.  He could give... 
[03:03:30]  No, that's $300 million.  Oh, it's $300 million, not $300 million.  I'm sorry.  That's where I got thrown for a second.  So what do they say?  That's where I got thrown for a second.  Manhattan has $7 million people?  So maybe...  Is it Manhattan or New York with the boroughs?  Oh, boy.  Which I've heard $8 million, but I don't know if it's just...  Does this donkey have to do it?  Manhattan?  Manhattan is $44,000.  What?  Manhattan.  What?  Manhattan is $44,000.  $44,000 people live in Manhattan?  $45,000.  There's not 45,000 people in Manhattan?  That's the best guess. 
[03:04:00]  What are you talking about?  $45,000?  Are you kidding?  That's not true.  This would look like fucking a ghost town.  Best guess for Manhattan population is $44,831.  That's impossible.  You're out of your fucking mind.  Well, that's not my statistic.  I disagree as well.  Dude, there's a thousand people waiting just to get into my movie theater on a weekend.  What are you talking about?  That's what it says here.  $45,000 people live in Manhattan.  I'm not going to argue the statistic.  During I Am Legend, maybe. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah.  Well, this seems more realistic.  Ah.  $1.5 million.  So where'd you get the first figure from?  Look at it.  I mean, you're looking at the same thing I'm looking at.  Your voice cracked.  You were panicking.  You guys are grilling me.  It says right there.  You went to some dumb source.  What's the source?  Google is the source.  You're not used to being grilled because Mommy never grilled me.  No, you Google, but then...  You know what?  You're right.  He gets mad when we grill him.  He doesn't have a follow-up.  Mommy never grilled him.  I get defensive. 
[03:05:00]  Yeah, because you never did wrong in your life.  Look at me.  Everything I did was wrong growing up.  Hence what you have to deal with every fucking day.  Everybody's defensive.  Jesus.  All right, you want to listen to Andy Rooney say...  Farewell.  Adios.  Au revoir.  You think they're already paying over his office?  Is there an About Schmidt situation happening?  Oh, yeah.  My favorite fucking movie.  Here's one of the first ones I did.  30 years ago. 
[03:05:30]  Why don't you take it and read it and maybe get...  And then it's in the garbage pill in the dumpster behind CBS.  Oh, yeah.  See how you do it.  You think there's a lot of people just standing around going, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Trying to be patient as he's slowly packing his box.  And he's like, I'm going to leave this one plaque.  I hope you leave it in the office.  A little memory of me.  It'll make me feel good just to know it's still there.  Right.  And then he gets in the elevator and somebody just throws it in the fucking...  Let me tell you something.  ...in a waste paper basket.  Let me tell you a story.  Let me tell you a story. 
[03:06:00]  I want to see some old ones first before I see a new one.  Well, and the one thing I want to say really fast, that happened to the great Scott Muni.  If you remember when we first moved to New York, NEW, Scott Muni, that motherfucker took us under his wings.  And most of those assholes didn't.  They're a bunch of fucking cunts.  But Scott Muni did the right thing and he was cool to the new kids in town, which was me and Ant.  And we started hanging out in his office a little bit.  It was like a museum.  Remember the shit he would show us?  Like, ah, this is from Keith Boone.  I don't know.  Yeah, it was great.  This is from the fucking time Mick Jagger did coke off my desk. 
[03:06:30]  And he had a million fucking stories and a million little things of tickets.  And that fucking...  All that stuff ended up in the garbage.  Gone.  When they fired him.  No one cared.  He took what he could at the time and the rest of it they just got rid of.  No one cares.  He just shoveled it into his coffin.  Shut the lid.  Have to sit on the top to get it down like a suitcase.  Just memorabilia sticking out of the side.  That stupid Earl stands next to the casket crying. 
[03:07:00]  Weeping.  Weeping.  Alone.  Just Earl.  Earl.  I remember...  The time I realized Scott Muni was out of his mind was the day he didn't have patience,  so he went out of the garage backwards.  Remember?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, you can't do that in Manhattan.  It's too insane around Midtown.  He took his car out the entranceway, which was just a skinny, one-car type of situation.  Yeah.  And just fucking barreling up the ramp. 
[03:07:30]  Wow.  People were beeping.  He couldn't wait to go out the regular way.  We have Andy Rooney from 82 on...  Wow, look at the young David Letterman.  I know the people here...  And Andy Rooney's already looking old.  He was.  That's 30 years ago, so he was 62-ish.  ...matter.  Did I use that properly, Acquias?  Sure.  I have a feeling that you're always...  You're always looking for stuff that irritates you.  Is that...  You sore about anything presently?  Well, he seems to look for me, as it's kind of the truth.  I'm not looking for trouble, but I find it all over. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah.  You're primarily a writer.  I think of myself as a writer.  Everything else is sort of extra.  I got into producing because I'm a bad producer, but I produce my own things better than anybody  else, and...  It's going to be too long.  Wow.  It already has been.  It's like 11 minutes long.  Isn't there just an old broadcast of him doing his thing?  Yeah.  You got like...  Yeah.  60 minutes old thing.  That's what I asked for.  An hour and a half ago. 
[03:08:30]  Oh, boy.  And I've gotten nothing but humiliation.  Oh, boy.  And scorn.  No, this is Andy Rooney discusses Frank Sinatra documentary.  Oh, boy.  How about this?  He gets a moment.  Classic Andy Rooney clip, 1970s.  I like this.  Classic Andy Rooney, 42 moments.  This could be good.  Oh, it's long, though.  All right.  We'll play a little of this, because it'll be...  ...thing offhand that mystifies Americans more than the cotton they put in pill bottles.  Why do they do it?  What do they mean?  He's America's grouchy...  From jiggling around, dummy?  I make my living having opinions. 
[03:09:00]  All I'm saying is...  A crinkly old loudmouth speaking on behalf of pissed-off citizens.  That's what's wrong with what's going on in Washington.  And a watchdog.  It's just going to be setups without Andy Rooney.  Nah.  What about a vacuum cleaner?  How about a Montez?  Nah.  Andy Rooney Montez.  That was one from, like, 1970, I guess, or whatever.  You got one, Sam? 
[03:09:30]  Do you want an old one?  Do you want a Montez?  Oh, boy.  He's confused.  Well, you're asking for different things.  Jimmy wanted something.  Oh.  Yeah, 1970s Andy Rooney.  Mother wouldn't do this to me.  No, mother wouldn't.  Mother would not do this.  Oh, Sam, good job!  Oh, boy, we're back to that thing again.  Didn't we say...  Do I have to take the keyboard?  Oh, boy.  See, he doesn't even want to smile.  This is too real.  No, this is too real for him.  Look at the look.  He stinks at Google.  He's making believe he doesn't hear us now.  Yeah, he hears us.  I'm concentrating on the task at hand. 
[03:10:00]  This is a little bit...  You want to strangle us, don't you?  Women in the workplace.  You're not used to being grilled.  Women in the workplace.  Let's see what this is.  You ever notice...  You ever notice that their big, fat tits pop out of a blouse?  And sometimes when you grab their hips, they jump like they're being raped in an alley.  Don't you hate when you pinch their nipples and they drop their coffee on their open-toed shoes  and you have to pay for the skin grafts?  You ever notice how fast human resources threatens to fire you?  When you yell the n-word while pinching a secretary's hiney? 
[03:10:30]  You ever notice that?  You ever notice how mad Ed Bradley gets?  When you yell that word down the hall while you're grabbing a breast?  What year is this from, Sam?  I have no idea.  Oh, boy.  It's from the 90s?  It's pretty old, though.  It goes back a little bit.  It's on VHS.  Okay.  Ever since the Clarence Thomas hearings and the charges made by Anita Hill,  there have been a lot of stories in the newspapers about sexual harassment. 
[03:11:00]  Oh, pause that.  You ever notice how mad a woman gets when you jam your cock in her soda can and get hair  all over it?  You ever notice how much that bothers a gal when you pump your penis in and out of the  can and you go, this is what I'm going to do to your shatter over the copy machine?  You ever notice how mad they get when you're going to be on the Supreme Court and you've got  pubic hair all over soda cans?  You ever notice that?  Why was there pubic hair on the soda can?  It fell out because he had his dick on it.  You ever notice how mad a girl gets when you grab your penis and go, you want a Mars 
[03:11:30]  bar right here?  And you stand in front of her typewriter?  You ever notice that?  Leslie Stahl hates when I grab her tits and call her toots.  I don't know why.  By the way, Tan from Fargo makes a great point, Sam.  There were 44,000 people at the Yankees game.  So you're trying to say that?  I don't care.  Everyone in Manhattan.  Everyone in Manhattan could fit into a Yankee stadium for a game? 
[03:12:00]  How many times do I have to, this isn't my statistic.  I'm not arguing it, whether it's valid or not.  It's the first thing that comes up when precious Google.  It's wrong.  No, precious Google gives you a bunch of things.  You have to then know enough to know that there's more than 44,800 people.  Google says.  No, no, Google.  But you said it in a way like you weren't sure.  This could be the...  I guess I said it in a way that I wasn't sure.  Mother never chastised him.  He doesn't know how to handle it. 
[03:12:30]  He doesn't know how to handle it.  I'm handling it fine.  No, you're not.  I'm defending myself.  No, no, no, you're not.  What should I do?  You're angry.  You're angry, you're hurt.  I'm not hurt or angry.  I'm just defensive.  No, because mother wouldn't do that.  Mother would not.  This is an unfamiliar situation.  Well, at 28 years old, why would my mother comment on my Googling skills?  It's been 28 years.  All 28 years, you've been looked at like the golden boy.  Yeah.  And then when you're criticized about something, you don't even know what it is to be criticized. 
[03:13:00]  He has no idea.  No.  He's always been mommy's good little Sam.  Mommy's good little Sam.  Well, he wants to be rewarded too.  Like right now, his hand is like clenching because he wants a little fish stick.  He would always get like little reward and treats.  Yeah, treats.  I wouldn't get reward.  And it's fresh laundry headed to all trees.  Fresh laundry.  Fresh.  Smelling nice.  When I was a kid?  Now.  Oh.  You get fish sticks and your laundry now.  Yeah.  Oh, he doesn't like fish though.  I don't think.  No, I eat fish sticks.  You do? 
[03:13:30]  Fish sticks, not regular real fish sticks.  No, fish dicks, he's saying.  He eats fish dicks.  By that, he means he blows Abe Vagoda.  Thumbs up or down on the fish sticks.  Fish sticks.  I want to try them.  I haven't had them in years.  They have to be really good.  Quality brand.  Yeah, Gordon's a Gloucester fisherman.  Everyone's commenting how you thought 44,000 people lived in Manhattan Sam.  At this point, it's a fact that you thought that.  Well, then so be it.  He's looking at it like it's Kansas.  Yes, that's, I'm looking at Manhattan like it's Kansas. 
[03:14:00]  I thought that 44,000 people lived here.  I was wrong.  All right, at least you're admitting it.  Yeah.  All right, here's any views on women in the workplace.  The newspaper's about sexual harassment.  There are news stories every day about the problems women are having being sexually annoyed by men.  These things bleed.  Men have been slow to learn that women don't want the kind of attention that has anything to do with sex.  Oh, boy.  It's especially annoying to women who work in offices.  They say men are always staring at them at the fax machine. 
[03:14:30]  Men make uncalled for remarks all the time.  Women want to be looked at by...  Well, you know what?  I don't think it's uncalled for.  I mean, if some jiggaboo broad is shaking her ass all over, I don't see what the problem is with grabbing those chocolate cheeks.  You ever notice how a black broad is different than a white broad?  You ever notice how white people can't dance?  You ever try to grab an Asian hyena and you miss?  What's wrong with people?  Why can't I make remarks on it? 
[03:15:00]  If I see a big pair of areolas, why can't I grab them and threaten to have her fired?  You ever rape a woman with a broom handle?  You ever do that in the closet while she's just trying to earn a wage?  You ever smash a secretary's face into a picture frame and break it while you're fingering her tuchus and threatening to fire her?  You ever do that?  You ever rip Ed Bradley's earring out and put it in the vagina of an unwilling secretary?  You ever do that?  You ever get ear blood in your cunt? 
[03:15:30]  I think I see what Andy Rooney's going for here.  He's talking about women in the workplace and how they don't want to be looked at as sexual beings and things like that.  Yet the whole shot of this segment is him thumbing through various periodicals, newspapers and whatnot,  at ads of women in brassieres and in sexy clothing.  So I think he's trying to say, hey, ladies, if you want to fucking be treated like that, 
[03:16:00]  then what's with all the images of you half naked everywhere we look?  All right, let's see where it goes.  Women want to be looked at by men the same way men look at other men in the office.  All a woman wants is to be able to do her job without being treated like a sex object.  They want to be one of the boys.  They want to stand on their own two feet.  Day after day, there are new stories about sexual harassment.  Women who never dared speak up before are coming forward with the facts about unwanted attention that they get. 
[03:16:30]  Women want to relate to men as business associates, not as potential dates after work.  If this episode with Clarence Thomas doesn't do anything else, it should make it clear to men that women are sick and tired of being treated as playthings.  I don't know why men can't leave women alone.  I mean, why can't we just start harassing each other?  I mean, sometimes Ed would come in with that big black dick bulging and I'd give it a little pinch. 
[03:17:00]  How do you not?  Do you ever notice how shocked a male co-worker is when you reach between his legs and grab his penis while he's at the copy machine?  And you go, they don't know why you're making that sound.  You ever notice how nice Morley Safer's penis looks through slacks?  You ever seen Morley get a heart on?  The whole time he listened to Eddie Rooney, he's thumbing through girl after girl like Ann said. 
[03:17:30]  I want to just reiterate.  And they're all just in fucking bras, panties.  Yeah, half naked.  Seductively.  So he's being very sarcastic when he's saying this.  He's basically making the point that women are second class.  Women ask for it.  Right.  They're second class citizens.  Mario, you couldn't do this to them.  There's no doubt we've all become more aware that there is sexual harassment in the workplace and elsewhere.  Women have begun to make men aware of how unpleasant this incessant suggestion of sex is to them. 
[03:18:00]  There's no question it has to stop.  I'm more aware of it than I was just a few weeks ago.  But I do want to say one thing to women in men's defense.  Give us a break, will you?  You don't have to be one of the 60 Minutes old-timers.  Who's that?  Wait, wait, old-timers, guys.  Just to know we're going to get a lot of mail about that one.  And, Andy, you answer it.  Just as we all know who we would hear from.  You ever notice how mad that anchor gets when you comment on her stupid purple dress and how her tits aren't big enough to wear it? 
[03:18:30]  You ever do that at the company party?  Fucking Andy Rooney was edgy, though.  Yeah, he was crazy.  He was making a statement like, of course we're going to fucking harass it.  They're asking for it.  They're asking for it, is basically what he's saying.  What about you sluts in the workplace?  He's hoping there's pinball machines all over the fucking place.  Yeah, he pretty much just called them whores.  Yeah.  Oh, we're going to get a lot of mail, and Andy, you will answer it.  You answer it.  Yeah, but my secretary does it.  Yeah.  I'll put that bitch on it. 
[03:19:00]  What's this, Sam?  Just looking at more Andy Rooney videos.  Food for thought.  This is called food for thought.  Food for thought.  Something to think about while you're dropping a deuce.  Well, people know who Andy Rooney is.  What's a blumpkin?  Strange words today for things.  You ever been coming and farted at the same time, and she stopped sucking, and then you can't come anymore?  You ever have that happen?  I was at a party once.  I left an upper-decker. 
[03:19:30]  You ever take a shit in a punch bowl?  You ever do that at a party?  You ever put Spanish fly in a child's birthday cake?  Did it once.  Found her on the gear shift knob of my car.  That old gag.  You ever do poppers at the office?  You ever smell amyl nitrate while Marley Safer's spitting on your dick with his hand? 
[03:20:00]  Well, Andy said goodbye last night, and this is how it went down.  This is what we're getting at here.  Not many people in this world are as lucky as I've been.  As lucky as I've been.  The unlucky ones are you who've had to listen to me.  Yeah, now you've heard a couple of clips of Andy Rooney that we just played from years ago.  Now listen to him now.  This is from last night.  But more importantly, we should have played a clip from last year, because his voice is drastically different.  And that's why I think he's stepping down.  I think he's got some kind of issue.  He's got this thing where he's breathing now.  I could barely breathe. 
[03:20:30]  When I was in high school, I had an English teacher who told me I was a good writer, so  I set out to become a writer myself.  I've made my living as a writer for 70 years now.  Been pretty good.  During World War II, I wrote for the army newspaper, The Stars and Stripes.  After the war, I went to work...  I wrote for Goebbels.  He's doing his own little Jew propaganda.  Yeah, you ever paint a big nose on a Jewish face and write something anti-Semitic? 
[03:21:00]  It's a lot of fun.  Most people thought I was with the United States forces, but no, I was with the Nazis.  It's real nice to draw a poster of a Jew with a rat next to it.  He's doing his own obituary.  Yeah, he's pretty much doing his own obit.  I wonder if he has an emphysema.  His breathing sounds weird.  Yeah, he probably has lung cancer.  He'll be dead in a year.  Or is that just from being 92?  He is old.  In the last year, he didn't sound like this.  Big drop off.  That's old. 
[03:21:30]  I went to work in radio and television because I didn't think anyone was paying enough attention  to the written word.  I worked with a lot of great people who had the voice for radio.  Who are now dead.  Or they look good on television.  But someone had to write what they said, and that was me.  When I went on television, it was as a writer.  I don't think of myself as a television personality.  I'm a writer who reads what he's written.  People have often told me I said the things they are thinking themselves. 
[03:22:00]  I probably haven't said anything here that you didn't already know or have already thought.  That's what a writer does.  I'm useless.  There aren't too many original thoughts in the world.  A writer's job is to tell the truth.  I believe that if all the truth were known about everything in the world, it would be a better place to live.  I know I've been terribly wrong sometimes, but I think I've been right more often than I've been wrong. 
[03:22:30]  Especially about the Negro.  I knew letting them vote was a mistake, but you insisted on it.  Now look at the economy.  How many times did I say it?  My friend Jimmy C and I, how many times did I deface black churches?  I was right and you were wrong.  And this one water fountain thing.  Yeah, and the time I snitched on that Rosa lady for not giving up her seat. 
[03:23:00]  I wanted to sit down.  I may have given the impression that I don't care what anyone else thinks, but I do care.  I care a lot.  I have always hoped that people will like what I've written.  Being liked is nice, but it's not my intent.  I spent my first 50 years trying to become well-known as a writer.  And the next 30, trying to avoid being famous. 
[03:23:30]  I walk down the street now, or go to a football game, and people shout, hey Andy.  And I hate that.  Or whenever I walk by a cemetery, they say, hey you, get over here.  Whenever I see a satin pillow, relatives hold it up to the back of my head and I catch them.  Whenever someone has me flowers, I hold them over my chest.  You get it?  Because I'm dead.  I've done a lot of complaining here, but of all the things I've complained about, I can't complain about my life. 
[03:24:00]  My wife Margie and I had four good kids.  Oh, Margie.  Now they're our grandchildren.  I have two great-grandchildren.  A couple of them weren't young.  Two great-grandchildren.  And a couple, well, let's just say my children hooked up with a couple of those people they shouldn't have.  So they were a lot of mixed grandchildren.  Two are great and two are below average.  Although, they're a little young for me to know how great they are. 
[03:24:30]  And all this time, I've been paid to say what is on my mind on television.  You don't get any luckier in life than that.  This is a moment I've dreaded.  I wish I could do this forever.  I can't, though.  But I'm not retiring.  Writers don't retire.  And I'll always be a writer.  A lot of you have sent me wonderful letters and said good things to me when you meet me in the street. 
[03:25:00]  And this one was from a Ted Kaczynski in the woods, which says, open this with your teeth.  What a lovely thing.  Oh, look, this one has white powder in it.  They probably know that I have an itch somewhere.  From Annie Thrax.  Isn't that lovely?  How nice.  Oh, look.  And more alawalaki sent me a letter.  How lovely.  Zionist Jew, open this.  Oh, thank you for your lovely mail. 
[03:25:30]  How marvelous.  Wow.  I wasn't always gracious about it.  It's hard to accept being light.  I don't say this often, but thank you.  Although, if you do see me in a restaurant, please, just let me eat my dinner.  Choke on it.  Yeah, because it's probably the last meal I'm going to have.  And you know that they have to mash it up in the back so I can drink it like soup.  You know how awful it is to drink a steak soup while you're taking a photograph with someone? 
[03:26:00]  Stop sharing your memories with me.  I don't care.  It's not pretty coming out either.  It's pretty runny and watery.  And I'm so old, it's not even warm anymore.  I'm shitting gazpacho.  I almost said Gestapo because of the Jewish jokes earlier.  Shitting Gestapo soup.  Oh, my God.  What a horrible fucking thought.  Yes.  As in for Andy Rooney. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah.  That was a nice sign-off, though.  Dead within a year.  That's what happens to the people that have to retire.  That's it.  Yeah.  Yep.  Arrivederci.  Arrivederci.  Let's go home.  That's what I say.  Let's get out of here.  All right.  I'm all for that.  Hell of a Monday, man.  Monday, Monday.  We did it.  So good to me.  No, I don't want to play that.  What happened?  Oh, was that E-Rock talking? 
[03:27:00]  Yeah.  Let's know if we want to play Sebastian Bach again.  The booming voice of E-Rock was coming through my headphones.  Mm-hmm.  Why don't we play one of Jimmy's Andy Rooney bits?  Oh, I don't know.  I don't like to poke fun.  You got one of those, E-Rock?  I like to poke fun.  Those are good.  Play one of those, man.  E to the R.  That's right.  E-Rock has to get his Eamon Gert haircut.  Eamon Gert.  That's the fucking most Nazi-ish hairdo you have. 
[03:27:30]  You really do have a Nazi thing going on there.  He should be giving like the low Hitler salute.  Not the full Zieg Heil, but the one where they just kind of half casually wave.  Yeah, yeah.  The officers were able to just kind of give that little, meh, there you go.  Yeah.  A little bit.  They'd all look at him and he'd pat his gut.  Too much Wiener schnitzel.  It's fucking Herman Goering in there.  Did he be mad if there was a ring around his tub and he'd shoot people for it?  That's fucking funny. 
[03:28:00]  Get a little doody ring around his tub.  I was eating a meat cocktail.  I was eating a meat cocktail and I shit in my tub.  He's eating meat out of a stein.  Yes.  He's having some fucking, some contractors build up a refrigerator out in the back and  the Jewish lady's too mouthy, so he shoots her and then goes, and do as she says.  They're building a freezer for sweetie.  And that's what all that hair was from in the concentration camp. 
[03:28:30]  He's going to make a big cushy seat for him so he could enjoy his dinner.  For Iraq.  I'm sorry.  Iraq the Nazi.  He is.  Yeah.  He does have that hairdo going.  It's unfortunate we have to go awake now.  I don't know.  What?  I don't know.  Oh, jeez.  Well, have fun.  I'm busy.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, I really am.  Guys, how's everything going?  You can't blow us off. 
[03:29:00]  We got shit to talk about.  I have a fuck.  I got to blow it off.  What happened?  I got shit to do.  I got very important things going on in my life.  And I don't have a moment to spare.  Getting your mock pucked.  Get it?  Yes, of course.  We figured that one out, Jimmy.  Okay.  I could have been getting your rock chucked.  Good point.  Somebody take minutes from the meeting and email it and I'll... 
[03:29:30]  I'll take hours or something, you know.  Ah, Chip.  All right.  We'll leave you with some more Andy Rooney and we'll see you tomorrow.  I got an Andy Rooney joke.  Do you ever notice?  Bye-bye.  All ladies and gentlemen, welcome to another performance of My Thoughts on Life with Andy Rooney.  Regrettably, Mr. Rooney has developed an unsightly goiter and will not be performing this evening.  In his place, please welcome award-winning thespian, James Norton. 
[03:30:00]  I'm Andy Rooney.  Nobody wonders why I complain.  I've been doing it since 1967 on the same show every week.  No one wonders.  People wonder why God hasn't struck me down.  People wonder if I shit my pants occasionally.  Do you ever notice I ran out of shit to talk about in 1971 and somebody's been too polite to fire me? 
[03:30:30]  I must have naked photos of Les Moonves or somebody else in CVS.  And my shoes.  I miss a lot of things about being younger.  Barefoot in the summer, remembering to pull down my pants before I defecate.  I miss those days.  Sometimes I sit on the toilet for an hour reading the paper.  And then someone says, your pants are still on, Andy.  And I feel like a silly goose.  This concludes tonight's performance of My Thoughts on Life with Andy Rooney.  Starring James Norton.  The virus.  Sirius XR. 
[03:31:00]  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Oh, yes, it's After Opie and Anthony Live.  It's Jocktober 3rd, the happiest month for all Opie and Anthony fans.  By far my busiest month of the year because I'm listening to radio shows every day right now.  Every day trying to find out what is the next Jocktober show. 
[03:31:30]  And your guys' comments on the Facebook page, everybody's been suggesting awesome shows for Jocktober this year.  Primetime Sam Roberts is the Facebook page, so I can keep them all on track and I'm looking down the line.  So keep giving me Jocktober suggestions at Primetime Sam Roberts on Facebook.  And if anybody finds a fugitive out there, I need to find out.  If there's a fugitive attacking any radio station, I have to find out. 
[03:32:00]  I guess we'll start with...  Suzanne in Long Island has been on hold for like 35 minutes.  So I guess, Suzanne, you're now on the after show.  Well, I'm very excited to be on the after show, Sam.  Oh, thank God.  You sound like my mom.  Well, that's why I'm calling.  It's because those guys were busting you about saying frog funny.  Yeah, well, yeah, funny, I guess.  Well, exactly.  Well, funny, see, I'm from Michigan, too, like your mom. 
[03:32:30]  And that's why I say frog the way you say frog.  And the way your mom says frog.  That's a good call.  I mean, both my parents were raised in Michigan.  Oh, I didn't know your dad was, too.  Oh, yeah.  You had no hope.  Yeah.  My kids have no hope.  Exactly.  And my dad says, like, just the weirdest shit comes out of his mouth when he's pronouncing words.  But he says it, like, as if he's an intellectual.  And that's how you pronounce things.  Like, he says, he says, Danny, what's the state that Boston is in? 
[03:33:00]  Massachusetts.  No, because according to my dad, it's pronounced Massachusetts.  And I don't even know.  There's no T in the word.  But you say costume.  So, like, you have your own hang-ups.  So you can't be making fun of anybody's speech.  He also, like, I get it.  But it's because they traveled so much.  They lived in all these different places.  Plus, they were both, their families are from Kentucky.  They were both raised in Detroit.  I spent four years of my life in England.  So there's just this mess of accents all thrown together. 
[03:33:30]  Jumble of mess.  Well, thanks, Suzanne.  I think you're right about the Michigan thing.  Yeah, absolutely.  And I have to tell you, I got one of your, well, I purchased one of your shirts, and I  can't wait to get it.  Hey, did you get a secret show to the future t-shirt?  Why are you stealing my plug for your plug?  I was just wondering if you got one.  No, I'm sorry, Danny.  I only got Sam's.  And I just saw the secret show to the future yesterday.  Isn't that L?  It's very, very nice.  And I would also like an Anthony Live from the Compound shirt. 
[03:34:00]  But where I live on Long Island, which is not too far from what I can figure out from  Anthony, I can't wear a swastika on my shirt.  Well, I don't see a swastika, though.  There is some controversy over.  I see an L.  I guess everybody, it's very strange.  Everybody, because nobody copied anybody.  But at the same time, everybody on the show decided to put t-shirts out.  Yeah, I know.  Real smart of us, right?  Let's all just do it at the same time.  At the exact same time.  Eat into each other's fucking audiences.  We haven't done anything for six years, and we all just throw them out at the same time.  And we all put them out on our individual websites. 
[03:34:30]  But the L and the F on the Live from the Compound shirt, when matched together as they are,  some people do see that as a swastika.  Now, let me say this.  Let me tell you where I live.  That's exactly what people are going to say.  Yeah.  Well, how come that's not okay, but when that Tom Cruise movie, what was it now?  Come on.  Oh, wow.  Give it to me.  Valkyrie.  Valkyrie, right.  I said it first.  All of the...  Yeah, Sam does when you get it demerited.  The advertising campaign for that film was based in the swastika imagery. 
[03:35:00]  I figured it was a Nazi movie.  I didn't see it.  Oh, listen.  Listen, listen.  I totally agree.  I would love to wear...  I just...  I don't want to deal with...  So it's okay on TV, but not on a shirt.  Oh, no.  No.  I don't think it's...  Listen.  I would love to wear that shirt.  I don't have a problem with it, but my neighbors would.  I'm just telling you.  I think if you wear the shirt, it's one thing if it's on TV, but if you yourself are wearing  the shirt, then people who see that as a swastika will think that you, Danny Ross, are a Nazi  sympathizer, which is probably a thing that a lot of people don't want to... 
[03:35:30]  So if you look at that shirt and you see a swastika, you're the racist.  Is that it?  That's right.  Now, if you want a non-offensive shirt that you could wear in front of anybody, you should  go to...  Just go to NotSam.com.  All right.  Thanks, Danny, for stopping.  There's a good one there, too, but if you go to TinyURL.com slash SecretShirt, you will  get...  Oh, yeah.  That's a good URL.  Oh, yeah.  It's great.  TinyURL.com slash SecretShirt.  What's better than that?  Two other three shirts are non-offensive.  Don't forget. 
[03:36:00]  Don't forget that it's November 5th.  The Secret Show to the Future, too.  Thank you, Suzanne.  It's going to roll.  Did I tell you, Sam?  Bob Kelly's down.  Now we've got Bob Kelly to roll.  Oh, my God.  That's the other announcement?  Yeah, dude.  That's amazing.  It's going to be a pretty cool show.  I hope everybody checks it out.  I'm sure they will.  It's going to air right smack dab in the middle of Special Delivery on Saturday, November  5th.  Well, I...  Sam's not on.  I won't be on.  Why not?  Because I went on this Saturday and said, well, that's November 5th.  The announcement I made on Saturday was that I would definitely be taking the month 
[03:36:30]  of October away from Special Delivery to reassess things.  Dave will still be on the show.  But I won't be on Special Delivery for the rest of October, at least.  So now it's just delivery, I guess?  I guess.  Because you were the S and he was the D.  Delivery with Dave.  Dave's delivery.  I'd say it's one of the great Saturday night shows here on The Virus.  I don't think he has guest co-hosts.  I mean, we could find a bunch of people whose names start with S.  I don't think he's going to have guest co-hosts.  No?  No, that was Eric's idea, and he got a big fuck you for that.  I mean, Dan kind of sounds like Sam. 
[03:37:00]  Maybe you could be Special Delivery with Dan and Dave.  No, then it would just be the double Ds.  Ooh, that's a little sexy.  That's a whole new show.  Yeah.  But yeah, so you may not be walking on me at all.  You'd have to deal with Eastside Dave if that was the case.  If that's the case, sorry, ESD.  Yeah, well, it is what it is.  But that'll be part of Anthony's Live from the Compound Network.  I also, I don't know if you knew this or not, Danny, you like to have sex, right?  Oh, I love sex.  Well, so do I, and that's why as of today...  You're going to have sex with Danny. 
[03:37:30]  Nice.  Well, if I did have sex with Danny, it would be protected thanks to my friends.  This show, by the way, After Open Anthony Live, is brought to you by those same friends.  My friends at Trojan, Bearskin Condoms, Trojan America's number one most trusted condom brand.  God, I love sex and condoms.  That's right.  Sex with condoms.  Thanks to Trojan.  Yeah, because who wants to pull out?  You're right.  You're right.  That's a very intelligent observation.  You just blow your load right into the condom. 
[03:38:00]  And our buddies at Trojan will help you do that.  You know, it's funny.  Like, you can go your whole sexual life.  Like, if you're in your 20s or whatever, you could go the majority of your sex without  ever, you know, busting that nut in there.  Yeah.  But then once you do, it's like that first shot of heroin.  It's like, how was I living my last 15 years?  Like, what the fuck was I thinking?  Somebody on Feedback is asking, why is Danny on the after show and not O&A?  The answer is because-  Because they fucking fired me.  He was fired.  Goddamn show.  That would fucking give me some cash. 
[03:38:30]  And I went to management and say, look, I need- I got Eric as a producer.  I need an assistant producer.  Eric needs an assistant.  So can I hire Danny for After Opie and Anthony Live?  And they wouldn't even do that.  They gave me part-time.  And then they said that for the- they said I could get part-time for the first half hour  and that the remaining half hour, I have to be an intern.  Right.  Right.  So actually, you've got about seven minutes until you're straight interned out.  On today's show, Jim went into his dream, which I like dream talk. 
[03:39:00]  I think it's very- especially with Jim's, how it was so detailed out.  He went into this whole thing, and it was all centered around him trying to get pictures  with the presidents of the United States of America.  Not the band.  Not the band.  And we're talking George Bush, Bill Clinton, and the like.  E-Rock, the Sex Bagel Nagel, you made an appearance in the Jim Norton Dream.  Yes.  How happy are you?  Good, because I wasn't being shit on this time. 
[03:39:30]  Yeah.  Well, I seem to be taking some of that role lately, which I guess I've had coming to me.  And by the way, there were people Twittering me, I guess, when I Googled Manhattan population.  There's a Manhattan, Kansas?  The number that came up, I guess, was the population for Manhattan, Kansas, which, if it were  anybody but me at that computer, I would find hilarious.  So I'll just say that for the record.  But because it was me, it was not a dumb mistake at all.  Eric, do you think that the reason you were in the dream with Norton is just because you've 
[03:40:00]  been so closely associated with his celebrity pictures for so long?  Because you've gotten him a few.  You've been the cameraman many a time.  Yeah, usually, if it's in a pinch or something, he'll call me to meet him somewhere so he  can get the photo because nobody will be there or around here.  But he alternates between myself and Roland most of the time.  Yeah, but you know what, though?  I think that maybe half of it comes from the fact that Eric is Norton's picture guy.  But I think maybe the other half is Norton knowing subconsciously that Eric is probably 
[03:40:30]  just as big as a picture whore as he is.  Are you as big into pictures as Norton is or has Norton rubbed off on you?  So it's like, kind of...  He's rubbed off on me.  Like the way when, like, and Eric, I'm not taking a shot here.  But when you hang out with Roland, you don't eat as healthy.  Because Roland's with you and he's kind of, you know what I mean?  So like...  So I'm absorbing from whoever I'm with.  It's a bad influence, is what I'm saying.  Okay. 
[03:41:00]  Roland, you know it's true, goddammit.  I know.  By the way, you guys can't see this.  Roland is smacking him in the back of the head with his cards.  Of course he is.  So what I'm saying is, do you think your hobby is influenced by Norton?  Oh, it's 100% influenced from him.  I learned it all from him.  I feel like Norton...  Not all of it.  I've never seen Norton fucking print out a piece of printer paper to have somebody sign it.  You do do that, Eric.  What about that?  You print out pictures from Google Images and have people sign them?  Like low res.  I have nieces and nephews, yes. 
[03:41:30]  Nieces and nephews?  Enough.  I don't want to hear about your nieces and nephews.  I have family members, too.  I don't fucking get portfolios of shit signed for them at the same time.  No, that's your problem.  No, it's not.  I don't have the problem.  No, he likes his family members.  That's the reason.  Because you're sleeping behind the wheel, Danny Cakes.  I guess.  You're missing the opportunities right in front of your eyes.  I'm missing all that tackiness right in front of me.  But this dream, it was like, there was elements of prostitution involved, but I think at its  root, it was just your typical anxiety dream. 
[03:42:00]  It was the same basic dream that Opie used to talk about having a few years ago, where  he was the DJ who didn't have another song to play.  It's all panic.  Yeah, who had the one song to play, and it's however that anxiety sort of manifests itself  in your head, is how, it's just how it is.  Like, for Norton, and this is what's really strange about Norton, that like, for Opie,  it was not having the next CD in because he was a DJ, so that was the anxious part of 
[03:42:30]  his life.  You'd think for Norton, it would be like getting up on stage and blanking, or pitching something  to a network executive and not knowing what to tell him, or being naked or something.  But for Norton, it's not being able to get celebrity pictures, which is insane.  Well, no, I think he got it backwards.  I think what bothered him more was not being able to close the deal with the girl in the  dream, and not being able to make her love him.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Because he was talking to the girl, and while he was talking to her, the feeling of anxiousness 
[03:43:00]  came up because she was keeping him from the celebrity picture.  You're right.  The girl was a distraction, this was a distraction, that was a distraction from the root goal,  which was getting that celebrity picture.  For Opie, it was getting the next song on the air.  You know what I mean?  Maybe it's not so much, I think maybe we're looking at it too realistically.  We're looking at this dream and saying, okay, well, Norton, he was being bothered  because he wanted the celebrity photo.  Maybe it wasn't so much the celebrity photo, but more so that he was being distracted by 
[03:43:30]  a woman.  Right.  It was keeping him from getting what he wanted.  What that was is inconsequential.  And that's definitely an element.  But what I find funny is that the way anxiety manifests itself in the dream, no matter what  the anxiety is actually about in his life, he has anxiety built up over something, and  the way that manifests itself is what's most familiar to him, which is panicking over celebrity  picture.  For me, I was always one step behind in my life. 
[03:44:00]  When I was in college, my anxiety dream was we had gym class in high school every other  day, so you'd have your gym uniform there, right?  And so when I was in college, I used to have dreams that it was like six months into school,  and I had not been keeping track of the every other day thing.  I still have those dreams.  And had skipped gym every single day, and I was about to fail the semester.  I still have those dreams.  And that was how my anxiety popped up.  And then once I graduated college, like now, I wake up and have to remind myself that I'm 
[03:44:30]  out of college.  Because I constantly, anytime I have anxiety dreams, it's I forgot that I had to go to a  class every day this semester, and now there's a paper due, and I didn't do the paper and  haven't been to any classes.  And I have to figure out how I can pass this class so I can get out of college.  And that's how my anxiety, for whatever reason, manifests itself now.  Eric, do you have any anxiety dream that just keeps coming?  Mine's the same thing with college. 
[03:45:00]  It's always that, oh my, like, fuck, I forgot I had an exam today.  I didn't go to class to take the test, or I didn't hand the paper in, or I didn't even  write the damn paper.  And it's crazy, like, do you wake up?  Like, I swear, I'm awake, and I'm lying in bed, and I go, okay.  Like, I have to talk to myself.  I've graduated college.  I'm dead.  Wait, did I?  Or do I have one semester left?  Mine takes place that I'm still there.  Right.  But I'm saying, like, after you wake up, do you go, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  And you've been out for years.  I'm 28 years old. 
[03:45:30]  I graduated when I was 22.  And I go, wait, do I have one semester left?  Like, I have to ask myself, wait, was there another semester that didn't fit?  I think there might have been, no, no, I graduated.  You look at your paycheck, and you say, no, no, I'm out of college.  I'm a line cook.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  No.  Do you have that moment, Eric, or once you wake up, do you realize?  You always feel like, wait, did I finish this course?  There's something that has been, something that's incomplete that you're still panicking  over for no reason.  Do you have an anxiety dream, Danny? 
[03:46:00]  One that just keeps coming back?  I guess the one that I would most...  Or do you just smoke enough weed before bed that it's like, no anxiety here.  Yeah, I've been living a good life.  Yeah.  Kill those dreams away.  But I guess if there was an anxiety dream, it's probably the wake up, and for whatever  reason, you've assumed that you're late, for whatever reason it is.  Okay.  And so I think that's probably what gives me the most panic, is waking up thinking that  it's like 7 a.m., when it's probably like 1.15, and I could still sleep for a little bit. 
[03:46:30]  It's all like, and the emotion that sets in is, oh my god, this is out of my control,  how do I grasp this again?  I need this back to me, there has to be a way that I can handle this.  I used to do that, but now it's just like, you know, like, if I do wake up, and it's  like 7 in the morning, it's like, I don't have a fucking time machine, it's just like,  well, I'm late, what am I gonna do?  I could either beat myself up about it, or just be like, fuck, I'm late.  What about you, Paul, do you have anything?  I actually had one this morning.  You did?  That I was teaching an intern how to do the phones.  Okay.  No, no, no, no, and he broke everything.  Is that true? 
[03:47:00]  Yeah, I really had this dream last night.  Because you were actually teaching an intern how to do the phones today, I thought you  were gonna explain your nightmare.  No.  That was your living.  But no, in my dream, he broke everything, and then ran.  Just literally destroyed it physically, and ran out of the door, and it was left up to  me to fix it with a minute till the show started.  Wow.  So this is it.  You're in here.  So then you called Mars, and then you had two people.  Mars wasn't here today, nor was he here in my dream.  Well, I don't think he was here today.  I didn't see him.  I don't know.  I think I saw him this morning, but who knows? 
[03:47:30]  Well, I saw him having a coffee.  Eric, where's Troy?  Troy is such an anxious, emotional person.  I want to know what Troy is.  Like, is it that the government has come and taken his family?  No, he goes to leave the house, and he realizes that he's all out of product.  Yeah.  Or he can't, his bunker that he's in is locked from the outside, so he can't get out now  that the blast is over.  Is he around?  Trying to find, oh, there he is.  There he is.  There he is.  Troy, have you been listening?  We were talking about, did you hear Jim tell his dream story today? 
[03:48:00]  Yeah.  And I was saying that, like, that's like a typical, to me, it sounded like a typical anxiety dream,  that the anxiety manifests itself differently for everybody.  Like, Danny was just saying, he just wakes up thinking he's late in general, whereas Eric  and me have the exact, or very similar dreams, where the way our anxiety pops up is that  we think that we either haven't handed in a paper in college, or for me, that I forgot  to go to class every single day, and it's the end of the semester, and I have to figure 
[03:48:30]  out how to pass the class so I can get out of college.  You know what, I just, I did that too.  I was just thinking about that.  You'd think, like, holy fuck, I missed the whole semester and you went home and didn't  realize you were still in school.  Yeah, and then I, literally, I was just telling Eric, I wake up, and I have to figure out whether  or not I still have some classes to take.  Yeah.  Like, I don't remember.  Do you have anything that just keeps coming back to having that dream?  Like, Opie's dream, we were saying, was not knowing, not having a next song to put 
[03:49:00]  in.  He's a DJ at a radio station, and he's playing music, and that CD's about to end, but he  doesn't have another song.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, a little bit, I don't, I really am very calm in this, in this age.  I know that sounds a little weird, but, like, I have good...  I don't believe that.  I have, I have a good emotional, I have a good mental peace of mind.  You were just, on Friday, three days ago, screaming at an intern.  Yeah, but, because he was just acting like a goofball. 
[03:49:30]  Yeah.  But, you didn't use the word goofball.  I don't get anxiety over that.  But it doesn't, you get riled up so easily.  Yeah, yeah.  There's a difference between agitation and anxiety.  I get, you're not an anxious person.  No, I'm not really.  I mean, there's certain things I get weird about.  Um, I have, I had this weird problem when I lived in Queens.  Yeah.  That, uh, there was gonna be pandemonium in, in New York City, and I couldn't get out.  I would say that's a weird problem.  But this was, like, a dream, or when you were awake, this is what you thought? 
[03:50:00]  No, when I was riding the train out.  Okay.  And I'm, like, I'm, like, way out in Bumblefuck, and I'm, like, if all hell breaks loose, I'm gonna be in trouble.  Hang on a sec, we got a hotline we gotta go to.  You're on after Opie and Anthony Live.  Sam, I have two dreams.  Oh, Club Soda Kenny, please share with me.  First of all, where can they find you on Facebook is the question everybody wants to know.  Well, that, that's the first dream that nobody likes me on Facebook.  I'm sure you wouldn't have to worry about that. 
[03:50:30]  You far surpassed me on Facebook at this point, so you, there's nothing to worry about that there.  No, you spread it out, because you've got more than one page.  Yeah, but, I mean, the fan page is what people count.  Go on.  And the second dream is that you're quitting Sirius Satellite Radio.  Well, I'm not quitting Sirius Satellite Radio.  That's not what I heard.  People are talking.  Well, people can talk, and people can talk, but I'm not, I mean, I love doing this show, and I like doing O&A every day. 
[03:51:00]  Like, I'm gonna, I'm just don't love Dave anymore.  Is that the problem?  Well, I don't love coming in on Saturday nights anymore.  I've been doing it for four or five years.  People forget there was a fan in Sam.  I've been doing this forever.  Yeah, but they pay you up for that, don't they?  That's none of your business, Paul.  Sam.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When you leave, they're just gonna automate your, your overnight show, because nobody's listening to it anyway.  Okay, thanks, Kenny.  Thank you for calling in.  I really appreciate, I'm glad I heard from you.  You wanna plug any of your bullshit before I hang up the phone? 
[03:51:30]  Why, why are you getting an attitude?  You just insulted me.  What do you mean?  That's not an insult?  You said nobody listens to my show.  Well, do they or don't they?  We get tons of calls, Kenny.  Of course they do.  It's brought to you by Trojan.  Not this show.  The Saturday show is not brought to you by that company.  Thank you, Kenny.  All right, well, are my dreams gonna come true?  No, neither of them are gonna come true. 
[03:52:00]  All right.  Goodbye, Kenny.  I had to hang up.  Enough.  Enough.  Every day, it's something else with Kenny.  I know.  This is what people don't understand.  And I go to his Facebook, and I read the comments on my Facebook, and people are like,  Oh, Sam sucks.  Stop being a dick to Kenny.  Every day.  It's not an on-air thing.  It's not a Facebook thing.  Every day.  It's something else with Kenny that he takes this little grain of truth, and then he makes  up a whole big story, and then he tells every single person who passes him in the hallway 
[03:52:30]  all day long.  Yeah.  And he grabs you and says, Come here, come here, and he asks you to be there, as he tells  every single person in the hallway.  Right.  I love the guy.  I think it's hilarious, but it's every day.  You could have a million things on your mind in the middle of something, and he will stop  you to tell you that.  I was literally cutting up today's Jocktober, this morning, and Kenny was trying to wave me out  of the office to ask me if I was quitting SiriusXM.  No, I'm not.  And you can clarify for him what's really going on, and it doesn't matter. 
[03:53:00]  I'm not quitting the company.  Why would I do that?  I love it here.  He stopped me on the way to the bathroom with a lot of concern about what's going to happen  to the overnight shift on Hits 1 and Saturday nights.  He said, You're leaving.  I'm not.  I like being here.  He was really concerned.  Well, I'm not going anywhere anytime soon, because it's fun here.  I'm having a good time.  It's great.  Enough.  Jesus Christ.  This is what people don't realize, Troy.  This is what I have to go through.  Yeah.  Now, talk to me about going on a subway and being afraid that New York was going to implode. 
[03:53:30]  Well, no.  You just...  I mean, you can...  You think he's dumb?  You can laugh all you want.  I mean, but there is the threat of some sort of...  I know.  I saw Cloverfield.  You know what I mean?  Like, you could say that's dumb all you want, but there is a risk of that, isn't there  not, Roland?  No.  No.  Right.  You're right.  This is Wichita, Kansas.  Nothing's going to happen out here, right?  Okay.  I mean...  I'm just going to get racist all the time.  It's crazy.  Well, you know what I mean?  Like, so if you're out in the middle of nowhere, Bumblefuck, Queens, and the neighborhood  I was living in was Jackson Heights, and nobody there spoke English. 
[03:54:00]  So if something goes...  If the shit goes down and, say, the power grid goes out, there's going to be absolute fucking  chaos.  So instead of, like, panicking every time you rode on the train, why wouldn't you just move?  I did.  Well, hold on.  That was smart.  That was smart.  What?  Did you have a plan in case shit did go down?  No.  That was...  That's where I got...  You never came up with any plan.  GTFO was the plan.  Look at where Jackson Heights is on a map in Queens, and think about how you get to  the good part.  So where did you move to? 
[03:54:30]  Manhattan.  And then you were cool.  I'm better.  I'm better.  To this day, does that still kind of...  If I sit there and really sort of think about it, but then...  What circumstance would this happen in, do you think?  Well, you have to...  Like I said, if the power grid goes out, what's going to happen?  And were you worried about that when the hurricane came a month or two ago?  I wasn't in Manhattan.  Specifically?  I went to Pennsylvania.  On purpose?  Well, I had a DJ gig, and then it hit...  I had a DJ gig that Friday, and then it was supposed to hit late Saturday night, so I 
[03:55:00]  just stayed out there.  Were you happy that you were out there instead of Manhattan?  Because the power grid could have failed in that circumstance.  Yeah.  Yeah, absolutely.  So you do think if the power grid in Manhattan fails, that it'll be anarchy?  Well, it depends.  I mean, quite possibly, yeah.  How soon?  After the power grid fails?  I don't know.  In Die Hard 4, it was like 20 minutes.  20 minutes.  In Die Hard 4, people in that...  Yeah, people goof on Anthony about his go back and shit.  But that's fucking smart thinking.  Do you have a go bag?  I have one, too.  I have a little something prepared, just in case.  What's in there? 
[03:55:30]  Just, I have some...  No, I don't really have a...  Nectarines?  I mean, I have tools.  I have, you know, food and water, just in case.  Is it nectarines?  Sticks to rub together to make fire.  Is it nectarines?  Yes.  It is.  I knew it.  Make sure you keep replacing them, because those things go bad.  Yeah.  Real quick.  You don't want a rotten nectarine, because then you're like, I'm fucking starving.  Right.  It's anarchy.  And all I got is this brown nectarine.  It's soft, for God's sake.  Ask me if I have a to-go bag.  Roland, do you have a to-go bag?  Fuck no!  No, Roland has a to-go bag with every meal.  So he has plenty of to-go bags.  I do. 
[03:56:00]  Sorry about that, Roland.  Have you seen the movie?  I saw the movie Buried over the weekend, just to-go bag reminded me of that.  The whole movie is just Ryan Reynolds buried in a coffin, alive.  Do you have any sort of fear?  This whole thing, implosion, because he had a little bag with him in there.  It was a dumb movie.  But do you worry about stuff like that at all, or just getting stuck in a coffin?  Yeah.  Do you ever worry?  Because he got kidnapped by terrorists and buried alive. 
[03:56:30]  No.  Like, I'm actually more worried that a terrorist is going to kidnap me and buried alive than  I am that there will be anarchy in Manhattan.  Right.  Maybe that's not a smart thing.  I'm not saying that that's the way everybody should be.  Well, like I said, I was out in Queens.  So Queens is different than Manhattan.  Well, in what circumstance do you think the power group would fail?  Well, I mean, any time in the summer when they're overloaded and everybody has their  air conditioners on, there's major problems and power goes out all over the place.  So you think, and do you think as Manhattan goes, so goes the United States? 
[03:57:00]  I don't know.  Because, I mean, one hot summer and this whole, you know, Constitution, this whole Founding  Fathers deal could be kaput.  What about a cold winter?  Well, that already happened a few years ago where the power went out.  Well, there was a blackout.  There wasn't a total anarchy.  Well, no, no.  Not the anarchy.  Right.  Everybody went drinking that time.  Yeah, everybody did.  What if that happens?  Well, because they were giving away free beer.  What if the power grid goes out and then everybody just goes out for drinks? 
[03:57:30]  Then it's a great time.  They don't have to worry about anything.  Then you're happy to be in Manhattan, right?  Well, then you go out and get some free beer.  Why don't you move out to, like, the sticks or something where you don't have to worry  about that stuff?  If that's something that actually crosses your mind.  It's just the commute in.  I like being, I like the convenience of getting close.  It would be tough to get here from Kansas.  It would be.  I mean, I work here.  I DJ in the city all the time.  So to commute from New Jersey is a huge pain in the ass.  I'm more worried about a Cloverfield monster attacking Manhattan than I am about the power 
[03:58:00]  grid failing and there being anarchy.  Yeah.  Well, that's fine.  I just realized that.  I mean, I'm the one that has to live out there.  You know what I mean?  Why don't you come out to Westchester, baby?  Like I said, I mean, the commute to come home at, I mean, I get off of DJ gigs at 4 a.m.  So until I would get out to Westchester, it'd be like six, you know, I don't have  a car, so I'd have to be like at six o'clock in the morning.  Yeah.  You'd have to get a car.  I would think you can't walk to Westchester.  So you'd be a lot of sleeping in the office.  But all right.  Well, I did want to play Sebastian Bach. 
[03:58:30]  What was it?  This is a cool thing about Troy's job because he gets to do a lot of the production here.  And if you heard the Flava Flava FU line promo where Flav was rapping on it, Troy got to  produce that with Flav.  Troy got to produce the good boy phone, naughty boy phone with Sully from Godsmack.  And now you got to do Sebastian Bach.  How cool is it to see these rock stars and hip hop icons?  Flava Flav is an icon, like regardless of how goofy he is now, like public enemy. 
[03:59:00]  Yeah.  And everybody knows his voice.  Need I say more?  Everybody in hip hop knows his voice.  How cool is it to have these icons performing in front of you?  It's a small room.  It's just them standing in front of you performing.  Yeah.  It's great.  It's amazing.  Especially like something like Sebastian Bach.  I wish I would just give you the raw track so you could just hear.  I mean, literally.  I mean, if you have them, you could.  I'll bring it tomorrow.  But I didn't have music or anything to it.  I just knew how I wanted it to go.  And I had him just do it acapella.  Well, I did it for him and then he just repeated it. 
[03:59:30]  So you sang for Sebastian Bach?  I did.  That's pretty cool.  And in Troy's defense, though, he has a small window of time to get it done.  So you do have a small window of time?  Like literally five minutes of that.  If that, yeah.  So he does his magic.  Are you in the moment when that's happening?  Or are you just like, we just have to get this done?  Like, are you like sitting there cognizant of the fact that, oh my God, Sebastian Bach  is singing a cock rock song in front of me?  Well, I look at there, you have to prioritize, you know, first thing that's most important  is you want IDs for the show and for Jim and for everything. 
[04:00:00]  And then after that, it's like, okay, we have a couple, we have a minute.  This is, can you do this?  And then I had to play him Sully's version.  It was cool because he was actually talking about just getting off tour with Sully and  Godsmack.  Little connection.  And so I played it and he was like, oh, cool.  And he's like, do you want me to sing harmony to this?  I was like, no, I want you to just follow me.  Do this.  And no, he does it.  And as soon as he starts singing, it's just that voice and you're like, and that's when  it hits you like, holy shit, that's Sebastian Bach.  Yeah.  That's really fucking him.  And then when I actually put it to music, you're just like, you know, you can't believe 
[04:00:30]  that you're, that you had the opportunity to do this.  Real quick, Wayne in Boston, you're on the after show.  Hey, Sam, I just wanted to ask you, what's the worst that could happen if there was anarchy  in Manhattan?  It would just be 44,000 people running around.  That's true.  I mean, with an island this big, 44,000 running around really wouldn't hurt much.  Thank you, Wayne.  And Sully, when he came in doing his own verse to it, too, that had to be pretty cool.  That was really cool.  Yeah.  We were just in the studio and I told him what it was, gave him the lyrics, and I was just  like, dude, just have fun with it. 
[04:01:00]  And luckily he had some time between his, what we did with him and his next interview.  So he actually had a chance to figure out the chords and see how he wanted to play it.  Does that make your life difficult, Roland, trying to make sure that we have enough time  here, make sure they get to their next interview on time, but also making sure people get  pictures and autographs.  And make sure that I don't have to go downstairs and cancel people, yes.  You have to go downstairs and cancel people?  Shit happens all the time.  That's my greatest fear.  Did you have to, oh, that's your anxiety dream, going down?  Every day, I swear.  Because you can tell the Anthony Michael Hall story now, can't you? 
[04:01:30]  Should I, have I already said too much?  Probably.  Okay, well then let's listen to Troy's production piece.  I also love the obscenely long outro here. 
[04:02:00]  Yeah, it's, the outro's just as long as the song.  You're just waiting for something to hit at the end.  Yeah.  It's not coming.  Like for him to be like, yeah!  But that's not happening.  Nope.  Because that's all he cut.  He didn't cut it yet.  Leaves you hanging.  Uh-huh.  So what is your anxiety dream, Roland?  You're, you, now Troy is like an emotional guy.  Like he's got a short fuse.  You, you do have a short fuse.  I, I mean, you're very easy to get riled up.  Paul, Troy has a short fuse. 
[04:02:30]  Um, from what I've seen.  Did you see him yelling at that intern on Friday?  You have a short fuse.  I wasn't here.  But that kid's a goofball.  And when you got into, you got into on-air fights with Danny.  You got into on-air fights with other people, I think.  Just don't wear bunny ears and throw napkins at him.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You've flipped out on Roland before.  Like, you have a short fuse.  You have fucking, you have flipped the shit out on Eric.  Eric, does Troy have a short fuse?  I will say this.  Yes, he does.  But from when I knew him back in the day, his temper, he's got more of a temper now than  he did. 
[04:03:00]  Because he used to be really bad.  Oh, so he's got, okay.  Oh, he, he wouldn't even say something back.  Like, really?  Or whatever.  He would just turn and then start swinging at people's faces.  Just because he was a psychopath doesn't mean now he doesn't have a short fuse.  Like, you can't, like, because...  I feel like I'm so calm now, though, dude.  But that's because you were way out of control back then.  Like, you're still not a human being in society yet.  You're getting there.  No, I'm, I'm a good...  You're getting there.  Uh, but Roland, your emotion is anxiety.  Like, that's your life.  Yeah. 
[04:03:30]  So I would assume every night is an anxiety dream for you.  I have nice sweats.  What's your anxiety dream?  If I have a big day, like, like, three, four guests, I'll, like, literally dream,  like, they cancel them, and then sometimes it's not a dream.  Or, or, or I sweat, I tear my phone, or I wake up at four in the morning just staring  at my BlackBerry going, I'm going to get an email to say move something.  So you'll actually wake up, this is true, you wake up in the middle of your sleep and  just grab your BlackBerry because you, you're...  I'll pace, yeah.  Wow.  Or then I'll watch TV from, like, three to five. 
[04:04:00]  So you lose, you lose sleep.  I lose everything, yeah.  You, you, you, can you imagine, like, like, like,  I've never woken up in the middle of the night and been that anxious about my job.  Do you, do you smoke weed?  Have you ever smoked pot?  No.  You've never tried it?  No, I'm paranoid enough.  Well, sometimes, sometimes that helps just calm your nerves.  You just kind of go, fuck it, who cares?  Do you think it was mellow amount?  I don't know.  It's one of those things where either you get super paranoid and you obsess over things, 
[04:04:30]  or it just goes, ah, fuck it.  You're obsessive and paranoid, too.  You have those elements of your personality.  No.  Yeah, get the fuck out of here.  You thought the birds in the sky were government controlled.  That's crazy.  They were dropping from the sky.  You have elements of paranoia and whatever in your, but do you find that weed mellows you out?  Yeah, it just keeps me from going on a homicidal rage.  You see, and yeah, I'm much more calm now.  I'm induced. 
[04:05:00]  Roland, would you consider taking an illicit substance to help you?  Yeah, trying to have a smoke.  I'm calm.  I'll be like, oh my God.  Yeah, exactly.  I worry that Roland would just get more paranoid.  Because I've seen people have bad reactions, even to weed.  People have bad reactions.  Sure.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And especially if it's weird stuff or whatever.  And if your environment isn't good and you're not comfortable with who you're surrounded with.  I mean, I remember having to sit, I had a friend in college who smoked weed literally every single day. 
[04:05:30]  All day.  And he just got a bad batch or whatever.  Like, something was mixed in with whatever it was.  And he didn't know what it was.  But I had to sit with him all night because any time things got quiet, he just, all that would come up in front of his face was him picturing his relatives and loved ones.  And then their faces melting off to a Terminator robot.  Yeah, that's not weed.  All night.  That's not weed.  I was like, dude, I don't know what you did.  That's like PCP or something.  Yeah, yeah.  But I've seen, even just weed can make people paranoid. 
[04:06:00]  And I think Roland.  I went to a Roland-Sons concert, got like a huge contact high.  And I was the most paranoid person ever.  Really?  I thought the cab driver was after me.  I thought people were going to come after me.  You thought the cab driver?  I ran out of the cab screaming at home.  And my brother just laughed.  You got some major issues.  And I think seeing a therapist is exactly what you should be doing.  How does that make you feel?  The therapist probably don't want me after like 10 minutes.  They're like, just get out of here.  They're like, no, it's too much.  It's too much.  Well, you know what you should do, Roland, to just calm yourself out? 
[04:06:30]  Have a little sex.  Masturbate.  No, no, no.  Have sex with a woman.  But make sure it's protected.  By who?  Speaking of that, after Opie and Anthony Live with Sam Roberts is brought to you by Trojan  Bearskin Condoms.  Trojan, America's number one most trusted condom brand.  And I tell you, I've used tons of condoms.  I mean, you guys know me.  I've been with the ladies.  Sam, you're the fuck master.  Yeah, I'm the fuck master is right.  These things never rip.  They don't break, ever.  They are the most trusted condom you could have. 
[04:07:00]  So big ups to Trojan.  And I appreciate that, because nobody wants another Sam Roberts running around here.  So does that make this show an official show, if you now have a real sponsor?  I mean, they're sponsoring the show.  The tickets last week were an ad buy, quote unquote, whatever it's called in this business.  This is a sponsor, for real.  When I get dick in the ass, I use Trojan.  You do?  That's fantastic.  That's what I would use, too.  Especially if you're losing as much sleep as you are. 
[04:07:30]  Hopefully that helps you sleep a little more soundly.  We got to wrap up, Eric?  Yeah.  Okay.  Because we were on time with breaks today.  Well, listen.  Jocktober continues tomorrow.  It's a very exciting time.  The Froggy Station that we did today was suggested to me by a listener.  Tomorrow's will also be a listener's suggestion.  If you want to get your favorite or least favorite show done for Jocktober,  the Facebook is Primetime Sam Roberts, so just write it on my wall, 
[04:08:00]  and I'll see it there, and it'll all be together and easy to track.  Or you can send it to Troy Kwan on Facebook, and then I'll relay the message to you.  I mean, thanks.  Or on Twitter as well.  That was just a cheap plug.  I mean, and everybody thinks you're weird now because you're afraid Queens is going to implode,  or whatever you said.  Whatever you said.  Stay dumb.  We'll be back tomorrow.  They have been suggesting that I do Sypha Sounds and Rosenberg on Hot 97.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  But I know Rosenberg.  Is it okay if a guy that I'm cool with, if I just attack him? 
[04:08:30]  The Sypha Sounds.  I mean, well, you said that you were friends with the one guy.  Scorch.  I killed him.  No, no.  The other guy that you did, you went into your school and you met the...  Oh, Chunky.  Chunky.  There you go.  And he's going to go down.  He's going to get it, isn't he?  Yeah.  Yeah, well, maybe I will do them then.  Stay tuned.  Ron and Fez are next.  Opie and Anthony and after Opie and Anthony Live.  We'll be back tomorrow.  Wait, Eric.  I would like to say hello to the Stengel brothers.  Goodbye, everybody.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.
