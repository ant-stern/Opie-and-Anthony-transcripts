<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with a discussion of Dennis Falcon’s pre-show antics involving listener “Rick D.”  Opie then shared a link to a donation fund for the families of two Boston firemen killed in a recent fire.  This segued into a discussion of a photo of Tom Brady seemingly observing the fire from his house, prompting comments on his wealth and a past relationship with Tara Reid.  A viral video of a road rage incident, where a tailgating man crashed after flipping off a woman recording him, sparked a heated debate about fault, with callers offering various perspectives and opinions veering into offensive stereotypes about driving habits associated with certain ethnic groups.

Ron Bennington then joined the studio. The conversation turned to movies, particularly "Noah," leading to a discussion about religion and biblical stories.  A newly discovered pink planet became a topic, with the hosts and a caller debating its composition and causing website crashes during the segment.

A later segment delved into darkly humorous anecdotes from a hospice doctor's experiences, transitioning to a discussion of age and cultural perceptions, focusing on names and tattoos for older women.  This flowed into further discussion of the pink planet, followed by a tangent about an unattractive woman in a viral video. The broadcast also included a discussion of a "Groovin Granny" video, with humorous and violent speculation about alternate endings.  A significant portion was devoted to the "Pink Panther" jewel thieves, detailing their heists, referencing a 60 Minutes segment, and prompting a pun from a caller.  A listener called in seeking advice about a stalker, leading to unsolicited relationship advice from Ron Bennington.

A major segment focused on the Opie and Anthony Show's 20th anniversary, including plans for an unmasked live show at Caroline's on Broadway. The hosts discussed anticipated revelations of embarrassing stories, past tensions with management, specific conflicts with program directors, experiences with wiretapping, humorous reminiscences, and plans for future content.

A section reminisced about their WNEW days, with Ronnie Mund in studio and a later call from Jimmy. Numerous anecdotes involved excessive drinking, encounters with numerous women, including shot girls and frequent studio visitors, and generally debaucherous on and off-air behavior.  They detailed the lack of management direction, contrasted with their current show, sharing stories involving betting on call durations, Anthony's late-night appearances, refrigerators filled with beer from competing companies, smoking, nudity, and explicit sexual acts in the studio bathroom and on office furniture.  Photos depicting nudity and sexual activity were described.  The upcoming "Unmasked" show and potential for a larger venue or tour were discussed, along with the difficult post-WNEW period and a call from Joe Valentino offering a car sales incentive.

Ron Bennington's return to the studio initiated a discussion about Joan Rivers' Tonight Show appearance, including unsubstantiated claims about Johnny Carson.  The conversation covered Joan Rivers' career and comedic style, mentioning Pauly Shore and a clip from her Fallon appearance.  Ron Bennington shared anecdotes about his career, leading into a heated, expletive-laden argument with an unnamed program director concerning the treatment of Fez Whatley and accusations of unprofessional behavior and poor communication.  The discussion touched upon Ron and Fez’s past, their move to DC, Fez's mental health struggles, the upcoming "Unmasked" event, Stephen Colbert's controversial tweet, and the ensuing online backlash.  The show concluded with the reading of offensive Polish jokes from an old joke book before returning to the discussion of the "Unmasked" event and closing remarks, briefly mentioning Danny Falcone as the post-show host.

[00:06:30]  these clips used to hit i was like it was a week at least a week but now it's like you got to get  your i learned that with my dumb youtube channel one day you have you got one day to get your views  and then everyone just moves the fuck on and this one did it it got uh oh god millions in in one day  it's doing great it's the road rage guy right crazy fucking uh guy in the pickup truck right uh road  rage um and he here's how it works uh he's tailgating somebody that's in the left lane uh he obviously 
[00:07:00]  wants to pass and the person's not getting out of the way and uh i guess the person starts a video  right recording them on their phone right the guy gets mad finally gets an opportunity to pass  on the right side right and uh as he's passing he flips the bird to the driver who's still video  videoing and um loses control of his truck he starts fishtailing goes sideways hits the median  goes over and apparently hits some kind of pole or something on the side and he fucks out pretty 
[00:07:30]  good wipes out the fucking car just destroys it sure and uh then the woman who's driving the initial  car that was in front of him uh starts cracking up laughing saying ha ha you know uh that's what  you get all things like that and on the surface you're like good for her good for her ultimate  thing you want to happen to whoever fucks with you on the road but you made one mistake  get the fuck out of the way well she made the mistake though she showed the speedometer yeah  if she was going on a respectable uh speed yeah but she showed the speedometer where she was only going 
[00:08:00]  i think 50 50 and it looks like a 55 mile looks like at least a 55 which means you can do 60 65 so  she's whatever she's probably a good 10 miles per hour this bitch under where she should be should  have wiped out along with this guy so i'm she was videoing yeah so i'm for the guy in this video yeah  and i know most people are saying you know good for her yeah but no you got car stop looking at it  on the surface she is the asshole in this video this is every twat that's in your fucking way when 
[00:08:30]  you're trying to get somewhere right this is every dumb bitch that's fucking sitting there in that left  lane not moving he's just an idiot i don't know what he thought he was in a movie you know when you  watch a movie and someone's driving and they turn to talk to the person in the passenger seat and they  never look at the road right the guy's flipping the bird for like a good 20 seconds what's the name  of this video staring out the window on the youtube so i can tweet it for everybody redneck road rage 
[00:09:00]  redneck road rage no hey hey motherfucker on pal talk she wasn't doing 55 she showed the speedometer  she's doing 50 i don't know what the fuck the speed limit was but and and the speed limit no the speed  limit doesn't matter at that point no if someone comes up on your ass it's not your job to enforce the  fucking well yeah just move over it's your job to get the fuck out of the way isn't it two lanes too  yeah it looked like it or did you go over yellow no it was two lanes okay we're going to study this  video a third lane shows up where uh i guess you have the ability to make a left turn um but again 
[00:09:30]  regardless of the speed when someone wants to fucking pass you and you're in the left lane and  there's a lane to the right right move over right i will know if i'm doing 85 miles an hour which i've done  on the expressway and someone comes up behind me i am like more power to you sir blinker on over to the right  i'll salute him when he goes by and uh you know take up where i left off this kid doesn't get out of the way 
[00:10:00]  right so here it is i mean uh yeah he's right on her ass she could have started the video a little  later by the way yeah she's still at home in the driveway a little later but the guy's right up on her  ass she's uh you know filming out the back window obviously and again if you want to get at somebody  that's tailgating you uh just go over in the gravel to the far left in the left shoulder of the road 
[00:10:30]  and you'll kick gravel up into their windshield and smash it wait is she driving and filming oh yeah  yes and that's a that's a two-lane road definitely instead of filming move the fuck over and look  here she goes she shows she's been on it's not even 50 it's about 48 48 but what if it's a two-lane  road that might not be a 50 mile an hour speed limit probably it might be a 40 or 45 mile an hour speed  regardless i don't know man regardless that's not a speed limit and that's not up to you  get out of the way i've been saying is there anywhere for her to go is it oh no it's two lanes 
[00:11:00]  there's another there's a right lane they're showing the right lane jimmy oh right lane and no one's in  the right lane it's not like they're in any heavy traffic there's no one really around them at this  point and she's only going 48 she could have moved over let the guy pass move back in the left lane  whatever she wants to do it's hilarious what happens to the guy but with that said she's the asshole  so now she showed the speedometer 48 miles an hour now back to the car that's right on her ass and  it shows that the right lane is wide open but it's her job to move over not his job to right now 
[00:11:30]  that's right around in the right lane but you know he gets around the truck again regardless  is she this guy obviously wants to pass and she knows it and she's not videoing and the guy's not  beeping no he's on her ass but all right here he comes down the side now now they're parallel now  he passes he passes her you can see she's filming my fan he slows down he wants to get by a window  he slows down because he sees the camera yeah so now he's like all right fuck that i'm going to give 
[00:12:00]  you the finger how long he's looking look look he's looking she's getting camera look he's looking  looking uh-oh and then speeds off after giving the finger uh-oh uh-oh he's totally out of it loses it  that's what you get all on video buddy how embarrassing all on video buddy could you  imagine how angry i mean how angry that guy is why did why did she stop i think to goof on him a 
[00:12:30]  little more oh really out of the car and laughs at him oh oh i didn't see this this is a different  actually got out of the car yeah like that what a dumb woman to get out of the car a guy that's the  other it's it's other parts of the country where you feel like you could still do some shit yeah  maybe you can't do that stuff in new york you'll get shot there was video of a guy getting shot it  was some road rage incident where the guy yeah they have his 911 call because some guy drove by him  and knocked his car off the road and then fired a shot at him so you hear the 911 call and then 
[00:13:00]  something like building surveillance you can see the guy had come back around right uh and that  guy wound up dead he shot and they haven't caught the guy crazy um but there you have it now again  but he is like all in with his middle finger staring at her oh is he just and then he takes off and his  whole car is out of control he just fish tails right into a bowl or something oh is he pissed when  that happens yeah jesus christ and you know he's going to try to file his insurance claim and that 
[00:13:30]  video is everywhere they're going to be like nope sorry uh i just tweeted it so in case you i mean  most people have seen these things come on yeah no that hasn't seen this video is there somebody  on my twitter did they comment on it the uh the about on the video says he initially fled the scene  of the accident but thanks to this video he has been caught and charged thanks to the video has been  caught and charged she should be charged she's using the fucking phone driving that you know what  that's right why isn't she charged yes yeah she'll probably end up being charged for something i hope 
[00:14:00]  so that i'm telling you you gotta look at it a little closer and i i believe she's the asshole yes  she's i would love to know what the actual speed on that road is but it's two lanes and if you're  going 48 it's not your responsibility to make sure everyone's doing the speed limit the cop that's why  when people say that i'm not going to move over i'm doing the speed limit right or that doesn't  matter get the fuck out of the way right make everyone happy right it's not going to cost you  anything to move over let the guy pass and then you know you take up where you left off i hate that 
[00:14:30]  shit uh all right let's wow everyone has a comment let's say hi to james in north carolina james  what's happening guys hey buddy i'm fucking kind of shocked this bitch is not being prosecuted  the left lane is a passing lane so move your fucking ass over exactly if it's against the law  to fucking use the phone i'm pretty sure if it gets a lot of goddamn video tape somebody instead of  driving give it a day they're gonna get her for you know they'll have to charge her for something 
[00:15:00]  it's not uh against the law to use the phone why in florida it's not but it doesn't say anything  about videoing silly florida really yeah all the psychos live down there how surprised all right  thank you sir let's go to matt in new york matt vista hi good morning guys the guy did get arrested  he was uh leaving the scene of a crime he laid the left what crime i guess leaving the scene of an  accident so you got uh if i don't think that's his own accident i guess you got a ticket for it they 
[00:15:30]  did say they got him so i don't know what they got him on but i maybe property if you crash a car  like that i think you're supposed to kind of sit tight though i really do i think if you damage  property like if you hit a pole or signs or something then you got to hang around but if  you just fuck your car up right i don't think that matters i think you could just leave yeah  all right let's say hi to mike in north carolina mike mike good morning guys hey hey i was looking 
[00:16:00]  at this on the blaze last night it said the reason she was driving slow because it had been raining  and the roads were slick who gives again all right who cares but that's then move over move  over all the people driving the right lane if she's afraid i was ready to say other people could  handle the wet roads but in this case i guess the guy could be not but yeah i mean but in the end it's  not up to you to enforce the law out of the way you know how much smoother if all that happened in the  the right lane then i would be more for her yeah because where else is she supposed to go the roads 
[00:16:30]  are wet and she's slowed down her speed but there is a passing lane still but all this happened in the  passing do you realize how smoothly traffic would flow if people just got out of the fucking way  like that and and moved over i drive that goddamn lie every day every morning and when there's a big  backup of traffic you know how you go through like a bulk of traffic and then you hit an opening  and another bulk of traffic like that every time you hit that big thing of traffic you look and 
[00:17:00]  there's always someone in the fucking left lane with no one in front of them right a fuckload of  cars behind them and everyone just trying to get around them trying to get around and if they just  would move over and let people drive do you beep at them i beep i i do the thing where i finally come  around them i man and then i will cut over on them so close to the front of their fucking vehicle that  they know and usually when i look at my rear view i see them like don't take the blinker goes on like 
[00:17:30]  oh oh i gotta get over i imagine you've given a finger or two i have fucking done more than that  oh let's go to snowy in michigan snowy twice in one week relax a little bit and what's the set  trying to become a character sit back and enjoy the show relax what do you do snowy you have to  participate you're an overachiever yeah participate what's up snowy right um as much as i do agree  with you the groom is a con believe me the driver truck driver i've you know if i had a buck for  every idiot i've seen on the road i probably have like lots of bucks i don't want my truck 
[00:18:00]  but um 200 bucks oh he caused his own accident in the end oh he's an idiot yeah but she should  have got out of the way i agree believe me i do agree with i mean the guy shouldn't like  come on you know so ape shit and then slam on the gas and then end up fucking up his you know 
[00:18:30]  you you truckers have been known to push a car or two out of the way oh my god  if i didn't think i'd get fired for it nothing more horrifying when you're flying down the highway  thinking you're doing a pretty good speed and you just happen to look in your rearview mirror and just  see uh an 18 wheeler literally feet from your back bumper oh my god you know those assholes should  get out of the way too though i'm it's like yeah you're right you know but i'll tell you one  you start daydreaming or whatever and and also you look up you're like holy but for every truck 
[00:19:00]  that is is on someone's ass because they're not getting out of the way in on highway traffic  yeah there's nothing worse than being behind a truck at a light and the light turns green and all  you hear is bang bang bang bang bang bang bang oh he's up to two miles an hour  there's a black soot in my face  you pick the wrong lane and you see everyone else is flying by him

[00:20:30]  and he was arrested in 2002 charged with disorderly conduct  yeah he seems like he's a problem  yeah okay  but she should have got out of the way  yeah  even though she was going over the limit  regardless  i think she should have got out of the way  i totally agree  uh uh so all right people thinking that's fake  i thought at first but there's no way  that's fake  no that's that one's  people are so dumb with videos  but but  you always are suspicious  is all i'm saying  that's true  i quickly didn't think it was fake anymore  but i'm like wow this is too perfect 
[00:21:00]  is this fake  and then i looked at it a couple times  and stuff  you know  it almost sounded like a sound effect  when the car crashed  everything was just too perfect in that video  you know what i saw the other day driving in  uh when we drive in  um it's still dark out  uh  in the left lane  again  people just you know  doing whatever  yeah  there was a cop  lights  fucking  blazing  on top of his car  coming up the left lane  and had to use his  whoop  whoop  because people weren't pulling over 
[00:21:30]  how do you miss that  when it's dark out  there's a light show going on behind you  and they  they don't see it  i don't know what happens with people  i don't get it  you could see him coming a mile away  and they just sit there  right  unbelievable  god bless texas  they always figure shit out  way before everybody else  that's not the problem  look  that was the guy that was flipping the finger  oh my god  he looks like one of our listeners  he looks like an extra from american history x  was there a wow sticker on that car

[00:22:30]  there's still a lot of people  that have no idea  that it is a passing lane  it's not a lane you just pick  and decide what speed you want to go  it really is a passing lane  and texas wants to give tickets  if you don't move out of the way  in the passing lane  huh  i'm all for it  i'm all for it  because you know what  i got no problem staying right  i feel like anthony in the morning  because i'm going  you motherfucker  and there are plenty of times  i'll just hang out in the middle lane  because it's moving as fast as i want to go  right  and you know  and if anybody wants to go faster  i got no problem with that  uh 
[00:23:00]  and if i want to go around someone in the middle lane  i'll use the left lane  but  people just fucking don't get how this works  let's go to chris in new hampshire  uh chris  hey guys  hey  i don't know  i don't know if i'm just jaded  being up here in new hampshire  where there's like maybe  three other people on the interstate  with me at any given time  but i think it's the guy's job  to bob and weave  um  i'm picking a lane  i'm driving in  i'm comfortable  oh chris  oh chris  you gotta hand in your man card

[00:26:00]  you can't say it  when you see that  white van  that has like  wacky graffiti  spray painted on it  because you know  it came from a certain  part of the city  and you see it  in the left lane  oh you know  it's coming when you pass  they don't pay attention  to the point  that they're driving  as people are putting  graffiti on their  on the vehicle  as they're driving  on their van  wow  well they're going  slow enough  there's also another  ethnic background  let's do this  let's just say  of rotund woman 
[00:26:30]  there's a certain  ethnic background  of rotund woman  that is incapable  of driving  chupsters  yeah but a certain  ethnic background  of fat women  blacks  i'm not saying a thing  i'm just saying  you can guess  i'm safe  because i had a  question mark  after that  oh is that  yeah yeah  blacks  it's insanity  hey we all know  the stereotypes  who are we fooling  yeah  are you kidding me  i've found members  of the asian community  to be delightful drivers  and very safety conscious  indeed  very safety conscious 
[00:27:00]  oh i love the asians  trust me  but i'll tell you one thing  you could fucking  drive next to  so that when you're  finally passing  right  with a goddamn  disco ball  spinning in your window  they will not look over  well there's a reason  they can't say  oh my god  all right  well this guy's a road  rage asshole  he says that  greg you're telling us  that you're a road  rage asshole  right  yes i absolutely am 
[00:27:30]  i am anthony  except for the  i don't go as far  with the ethnic  slurs  because i know  people have  video cameras  oh i thought  you might think  of feelings  but i cut people off  i've caused accidents  to people  who are fucking  with me  in the left lane  i do it  however  when you're on a road  and there's nobody  but you and some asshole  just go around them  it's so much easier  oh i've talked on that  plenty  i have done that  plenty of times 
[00:28:00]  he's not making a bad point  i understand the going around  but there's a principle  that comes into play  what's really frustrating  when you got someone  in the slow lane  doing the exact speed  of someone in the passing lane  when they're matching speeds  like that  you just  so this guy  isn't that wrong here  yeah  hmm  do we change our opinion  no he finally  because he finally  does go around  right  you know  you look at  how it turned out  he got all that angry  all that pissed off  inside him  and then he went around 
[00:28:30]  and crashed his car  look you're being  i understand  look you're being  you're being reasonable  hindsight guy  and the best part  he was ready to fly by her  but saw the video camera  and said oh really  now i got it  i'm gonna give you  something for your video camera  and boy did he  he certainly did  yeah  sounds to me like  he got his comeuppance  now one other thing  turnabout's fair play  that's right  tit for tat  you noticed  anthony have you noticed  that on highways  where there's more than  three lanes  the left lane  is really becoming  the slow lane  and the right lane 
[00:29:00]  is the lane  we can pass people in now  it's crazy  it's because everyone  feels compelled  to get into that lane  when i come out of that  what you call midtown tunnel  when i'm driving home  i come out  and everybody  jockeys for position  and i go to go  to the left lane  and fucking floor it  and it never fails  someone will go  from the middle lane  and there's no one  in front of them  they can just go  about their business  they will get in  that left lane  and not go  as fast as i want to go  or other people  want to go  and there's no reason 
[00:29:30]  for them to get in  but they feel compelled  to be like  i'm going to get  in the left lane  because i feel  like i'll go fast  you're not going fast  stay in whatever  stay in whatever lane  to the right  is going your speed  what about the people  that you know  have shitty cars  for snow storms  oh boy  and they just assume  well i can't handle  this weather  so i'm just going to  go nice and slow  in the left lane  in the left lane  and you got the suv  or whatever  you have  right  whatever  a nice snow truck  and you have to sit there  and go 
[00:30:00]  god  stay home  stay home  they got to make a living  fuck them  they got to make a living  white women  on their phones  and suvs  are the worst drivers ever  not the worst drivers ever  but i'll  they're up there  i'll give you a shitty driver  and uh  they're up there  and boy  can you tell  when a car's speed limit  is varying by 15 miles an hour  and they're weaving  in and out of lanes  and it's the afternoon  it's not like a drunk thing  you just know  you're going to see someone  yapping on their phone  yapping away  not even yapping 
[00:30:30]  or texting  the texting is scary  well they are saying  i read yesterday  right  that uh  texting is not the main cause  of accidents on cell phones  it is  talking on the phone  really  really  if someone dialing  that's that's a problem  that causes things  but more accidents  are from talking on the phone  people lose concentration  when they're talking  on the phone  what  yes  it's hard to drive  and talk  and concentrate on your driving  even when you're  you're just talking  even hands free  that's what I read  i'm kind of 
[00:31:00]  extremely happy  that i went from the blackberry  to the uh samsung  for the etch-a-sketches  jason  this thing is pretty big  but i like it  i was trying to  white gloves  i was using it last night  right  and uh  i went to do a one hand thing  with something to the left  of the screen  i'm holding it in my right hand  and something way over  to the left of the screen  my thumb couldn't reach  yeah but  i needed a fucking  arsenio hall thumb  but you weren't paying attention  to the white glove service  white gloves  no i know  you can move everything over  that's a great feature  well on your screen  well because they know 
[00:31:30]  these phones are just  slightly too big  to do one handed shit  so they got something  where you can  in settings  you can move everything over  so you can  you can touch everything  but then it's moved over  no but i think  everything on the screen  that you don't have to  fuck with stays where it is  but your controls  move over  closer to your thumb  so you can hold it  with one hand  and still work it  with your thumb  right  yeah i saw that  it's kind of smart  i haven't used it yet  but i haven't seen  i didn't see what was done  but i'm glad i went  from the blackberry  to the samsung  for the for the reason  it made me stop texting  while driving 
[00:32:00]  oh yeah  because you can't  because you have to  look down way too long now  yeah  with the blackberry  i was able to figure out  the you know the keyboard  for the most part  yeah  and and get some things  done by feeling the buttons  because i just climb  in my back seat  and i start texting  from there  it's a lot easier  what  it's not safe  does that have a voice  thing on it  like a siri  oh yeah it has all that  that that to me  has increased my texting  driving because i can just do it  and i just do a quick proofread  and there's always half  it's always wrong  proofread  that's where the  that believe me  you know i know 
[00:32:30]  i know  boy  i like when you're texting  though and driving  you go i could i could get  another couple of letters  yeah you look up and down  i think i got a couple of  letters here before i look up  again  get the co and then you look  down  all right quick  you did the ck  send  the brake lights  oh good thing i didn't  try for the whole word  there  good thing i didn't put  sucker at the end  white gloves  after i'm a good cock  i would never lie  average  average  and best 
[00:33:00]  what happened to your  watch  no watch today  i did not charge it  i need to  are you over the watch  already  no i like the watch a lot  i think i'm gonna use the  watch when i'm driving  period  yeah  because you don't really  need it you know  just walking around for the  most part  it is it's a cool  accessory but i hate  accessories  i gave it to a pilot  name of wanaki  are you an accessories  guy  i don't know  i don't  i like a good watch  but are you an  accessories guy  this is like an  accessory 
[00:33:30]  tech accessories  you do  i'm not  no i just  i just like that word  more than i hate  anything al-qaeda  i hate that word  i like the basics  but i don't like  accessories to my  shit  but that's not that  bad an accessory  it's a watch  it doesn't look bad  the the digital face  looks kind of cool  the colors and  everything i like it  i do a lot of driving  on the weekends  so i will absolutely  pop this on  you know what the  bad thing is  i can make some  phone calls  and you can quickly  you can quickly  check text messages  here's the bad thing  because you look  you look at  you pop your watch  right up to your face 
[00:34:00]  but here's the bad  thing about it though  um it it comes on  when you move your wrist  right so you could like  move your wrist around  and the watch comes on  right  if you're driving  it's constantly popping on  that's why the battery  goes dead  what do you mean  on in what way  like the the face  will come on  you know how it goes  oh that's burning  it's like energy saver mode  and then when you move  your wrist like  that's burning  battery power huh  yeah so i'm driving  i got my left hand  on the wheel  and then if you're  moving your hand  to just steer  it comes  why couldn't they  put a watch battery  in this  i think it's just 
[00:34:30]  too much shit  going on  why do you have to  charge your  it's weird to  have to charge a watch  there's too much shit  going on there  it'd be going dead  a fucking week  imagine if it was  on your right hand  it'd be on or be off  it'd be on or be off  flying i'm jerking  off a lot  i certainly am  while driving  i guess  you'll end up  texting the world  i think that's it  everyone got their  opinions in  yeah  actually i would  take assholes  everyone's got one  like who was it  the poor girl  she said  asa akira  she texted  something really funny  i think it's  she said  opinions are like

[00:43:30]  the drawings  yeah  yeah the drawings  I really don't know  I stopped paying attention  a while ago  and then they get mad  like no it's really happened  I'm like we've heard  that so many times  when we see guys in here  actually doing something  then we'll actually  be excited  I don't know  I got the little monitor  you did  that's what I asked for  you asked for a small monitor  for the phones  beautiful  and after a year  I got it  so they were going  in the right direction  I thought you were  just getting bigger  I didn't know  that the model  didn't get on  it's like Lily Tomlin 
[00:44:00]  they put her in that  giant chair  make her look  that would be cool  at least we'll feel  like we have a  big studio  so everything has to  get big  wait how would that  work for us  no everything has to  get smaller  and we'll feel like  we're big  we'll just like  Peter Dinklage  a personal pan pizza  sitting in front of you  one of the new  Pepsi Minis  right  yes  oh there's some  great movies  coming out this weekend  oh boy  Russell Crowe 
[00:44:30]  he's pushing this one  yeah  you know you're not  confident in your movie  when you want a picture  with the Pope  to help promo  it the first week  yeah  yeah  it's got a buzz on this  well the headline is  Russell Crowe's  intense but silliness  sinks  FX filled Noah  oh sinks  get it  yeah  well they're clever  with that shit  they are  and then you got  the Schwarzenegger movie  starting this weekend  don't you think  it would be tough  to get anybody  to believe the Noah  thing now  you know what I mean  it really is  like  these Bible epics  were good back 
[00:45:00]  you know  50's 60's  Charlton Heston's  got to be in it  yeah  but now  I think people  just go  that's a bunch  of more shit  right  you know  people are still  religious though  that I think  that will go to this  like Last Temptation  of Christ  or what was  the Mel Gibson one  but I think  the Noah one  really stretches  your faith  where you could go  it's going to rain  so much  it's just a wooden  boat  with a bunch  of animals on it  every animal  and they never  explain where  they shit  I guess  it's some 
[00:45:30]  because I remember  bringing up in school  I go  I can't imagine  the shit smell  did you get whacked  in the hand  with a ruler  no I was just  explaining that  they probably  hung their asses  off the boat  like you do  when you're on  a party boat  when you're  deep sea fishing  sure  shit off the boat  shit off the side  wouldn't everyone  get sick too  fucking hippos  throwing up  on top of the  dung beetles  it would just be  a mess  I don't think  the giraffe  is used to  being on the water  so you gotta think  the giraffe 
[00:46:00]  will have some  seasickness  going on  what a dumb story  that all the animals  would have to fuck  if one was impotent  or sterile  the whole species  would stop  and then they get mad  that more people  don't believe  how about you  come up with  more believable stories  crazy ass stories  yeah  I loved him  in gladiator  I gotta tell you  that was a fantastic movie  what year was that  2000  was that 2000  that's a great movie  did we find the boat  Noah's boat  no no 
[00:46:30]  I always think  they find it  in a mountain  somewhere  it's always a mountain  we're not allowed  to go near  and it's like  a rock formation  that looks kind of  like the bottom  of a boat  I thought we found  a little piece  of whatever that is  and it's always  a Christian scientist  that you know  what I mean  right  right  when they wheel  those things out  to say that the earth  is only 6,000 years old  you feel embarrassed  for them  that is just silly  it's like the opposite  of cosmos  and they're grabbing  at straws  to try to explain why  hey we got one of those  Earl  Earl believes  Earl believes 
[00:47:00]  Earl believes  the earth is 6,000 years old  he does  that's crazy  how dumb are people  well  Earl  it's like a childlike mentality  yeah  no you don't know  especially when you start  discovering more of the universe  and it's like ridiculous  didn't we discover  a new planet yesterday  the pink one  on the outskirts  of our universe  a little pink planet  it's called the  planet Fez  wow  is that the  oh shit  what did I say  wow  you know it hurts  that's pink  it's a little joke

[00:48:00]  it sounds right  that's all I care about  right  as long as it sounds  that sounded right  and why is it pink  yeah  it's made of  ice and rock circles  yeah but that doesn't make pink  I don't know  ice and rocks don't make pink  it's a fucking rock circle  yeah  what do you mean  like it's got rings  oh you don't know  no I'm not  I'm not a sandwich  astrophysicist  oh boy  you just have to be a good reader  the article's right there  I'm sure somewhere in that article  it's gonna explain why it's pink  I know  sorry I gotta broadcast these background

[00:51:00]  and what's that headline  sure  frozen pink dwarf planet  Biden  spotted  they're calling it Biden  why  after Joe  and it's 7 and a half billion miles  from the sun  because it's the same size  as Delaware  so they're just calling it  it's a tiny thing  it's jokingly nicknamed  Biden after vice president  yeah  they have good jokes  in his faith in immunity  what do you want to call it  let's call it Biden  oh you're out of your mind  now it's in the books  they laugh  it's the temperature there  is 430 degrees  we don't  we just wanted a white 
[00:51:30]  pink  sounds like our winter  right guys  am I right  oh man  hold on  high five  I'm dealing with that  it's cold as heck  come on  it's just cold  if you found a pink planet  you should describe  you know  explain why it's pink  it's the biggest part of the story  exactly  yeah why is it pink sell  I'm trying to find  maybe how quickly  I've lost interest though  where are we going now  I don't even care  exactly  Catholic online  that's a good point  Catholic online  yes  maybe because Jesus  painted it pink  like an easter egg  they'll say  6,000 years ago 
[00:52:00]  could this be hell  did we finally find hell  yes  it's a pink socked planet  that came out of the anus  of a larger planet  go to the Jesus paper  and see  why only Latinos believe now  you can't shake them  no  no they're hanging in there  when the Pope  the last Pope  was driving down  he actually went past  my neighborhood  yeah  and it looked like  the Puerto Rican Day parade  they were the only people  that showed up  they loved Jesus  I'm like where's the Polish  where are the Italians 
[00:52:30]  they're starting to catch  they're starting to get  I think like Latin America  is like where America was  in like the 60s or 70s  with the church  they're starting to go like  it's a little creep  but it's still got a few years  left down there  but it'll go  I don't know  people are fed up  people really love that  because the new Pope's open too  but they also believe in  Chupacabra  and all kinds of shit  oh Chupacabra  oh yeah  you gotta believe in that  yeah I believe in the Chup  well did you hear  we had a Yeti guy on you  Yeti guy  two days ago  the guy that's gonna jump off  Everest with the little suit  swears he saw a Yeti 
[00:53:00]  he said he saw a Yeti  he walked out of his tent  at a base camp  while he was climbing a mountain  and Yeti was right in front of him  it jumped  300 feet  over a rock mountain  according to him  according to him  of course  oh okay  we should ask more questions  about that  we should ask any questions  yeah  the guy who saw  the Yeti  or his American cousin  the Sasquatch  right  pink planet  anything  they found it yesterday  it's like  they don't think they know  all the  but guys that are smarter than us 
[00:53:30]  just know why it might be pink  that could be all guys  yeah  they gotta know what it's made of  I bet it's the composition of ice  it's not water ice  it's some type of gaseous thing  that probably throws off pink light  yeah  I would think  yeah  not one caller knows either  Dr. Steve  Dr. Steve  well  the atmosphere is made up of a fluid  yeah  technically what will happen is  it will get dyed pink  but it's really an illusion  illusion  yeah  it's like a hemorrhoid 
[00:54:00]  it fills with blood  while he's talking to you  one of his patients is dying  right next to him  absolutely  right off the old mortal coil  yeah  you can hear like the little pen  moving over the toe tag  he's putting a final time  you can always tell when the phone  gets weird when he crunches it  to check the time of death  on his fucking phone  honestly I think  I could be a hospice doctor  who couldn't  exactly  all you gotta do is  you just have to be nice  gotta tap a cheek  every so often  say there there  be good at giving bad news  it's your only qualification  and make sure you open the window  so the soul  you know leaves 
[00:54:30]  right that's right  we all saw the commercial  not tonight  or whatever the fuck  her name is  not tonight  Mildred  whatever her old person name is  all dramatic  like oh good  she's got 12 more hours  you could shut off  the old life call  they're making a big deal  out of the fact  that she's got 12 more hours  pop the battery out of that necklace  right  I'm gonna hate when you start  seeing old ladies  in commercials named  Amber  and Lexus  then you know  we're getting fucking old  that's not good  that Alexis and Amber  will be old lady names someday  oh come on  the cocaine takes care of that 
[00:55:00]  I don't know  there's already old  tramp stamps and stuff  you see them in the grocery store  when some woman bends down  to get those Goya beans  they always keep on the fucking floor  and you see that fucking  old tramp stamp  you're like  oh  that was a great idea  in the 80s  she was cutting edge  seems smart  it seems smart  well we're gonna go to show  tribal  tribal art  because Sal doesn't have the answer  Sean and Marilyn  Sean  Sean  yeah I'm trying to talk  hey 
[00:55:30]  I just wanna know  how you guys think  they figured out  the composition of this planet  when it's 7 billion miles away  I don't think they flew there yesterday  no  they did actually  they used different spectrums  and they could take an educated guess  I bet you Neil Tyson  would give us an educated guess  he'd know it was cold  they used various filters  and what kind of light  it throws off  you could tell what the composition  is based on  the type of light  it throws off  let's try to get the Meech on today  Meechukaku  in between being scared 
[00:56:00]  he'll tell us  what's up with the pink planet  it was his sister  that was at Jimmy's show  that called this  Meechukaku I love  but he won't have  like I like Brian Green  better as a theoretical physicist  Brian Green was great  yeah  because Meechukaku  it's like a little  it's like if you had  a little bunch of cookies  surrounded by a little pink  hole in the donut  he really does  explain things  like your children  but we are  left right at you  must be annoying  to explain things  you know I wonder  if Brian Green  oh she's a pig 
[00:56:30]  what does that  what happened  everyone was wondering  if that girl  that filmed the  that's her  oh god  damn  what an oinker  what an oinker  we got a lot of people  calling today  saying you think  she's hot  no  you can tell  hold on what's that  seems like an Amish kid  oh Groovin Granny  is making the rounds  this is the news  right  grandma dances  to the ice  while cooking  grandma's dancing  eww  Groovin Granny 
[00:57:00]  yes  this Groovin Granny  why is that crazy  it's not  cause she listened  to Ice Ice Baby  when she was younger  how great would it be  if this ended  like a home invasion  video  where fucking granny  had that pot smashed  against the back  of her head  I was just gonna  see it end like  Nicholson's wife  in what was that movie  oh yeah  something Schmidt  Schmidt yeah  about Schmidt 
[00:57:30]  yeah  the vacuum cleaner  under one shoe  askeel  yes  I don't know  I despise it  maybe  as a dog was  or she does that  every morning  amazing  this box and friends  is everything  that's wrong  with the news  granny had big boobs  they're all that way  though  I mean no matter  where you go  you're right  you're right  she had nice pillow  good morning  thank you  alright well  oh no don't put it there  oh good dear  oh dear  could have spilled  you put the coffee  on a bunch of napkins  thank you for catching that  delightful to see you 
[00:58:00]  yes  Sal is still trying  to figure out  why the blood is pink  exactly  now one person  just guessing  why it's pink  call Sam  yeah  Sam would know  Sam would know  I know why  Travis  oh Travis  is gonna let you  off the hook  Travis being gay  this kind of fits  into the whole  yeah  if it was like  green  I would have  you would not know  I would  the dramatic coloring  of the gas giant  is indicative  of its youth  hold on  can we say something  gas giant  and 283 mile circumference 
[00:58:30]  do not go hand in hand  one of you guys is wrong  it's not a gas giant  I'm reading an article  about the planet  okay well then  why are you calling it  a gas giant  I'm not calling it  a gas giant  they have a lot of gas  it's just a baby  NASA scientists  estimate the age  of the solar system  is 160 million years old  the planet is literally  glowing from the heat  of its recent formation  oh it's brand new  oh so  they're probably saying  how's it around here  the heat  but it's also  400 degrees below zero 
[00:59:00]  stop jumping in  like you knew  that all along  too late  I knew that  I had a chance  too late  I'm trying to hijack  Travis's brilliant  explanation  maybe the core  is just a couple  of hundred miles  and then the gas  around it  is bigger  I don't know though  I don't care anymore  I've completely  lost interest  in this story  after like a minute  alright  7.2 billion miles  from here  you know what  doesn't affect  my day to day  working  yeah let's see  that planet  carousel  to the job site  right  you know  when I'm putting 
[00:59:30]  up some lumber  planet doesn't  mean a hill  of beans  I'm getting two eggs  over easy  with bacon  on a roll  salt pepper  ketchup  yeah  of course  not ketchup  boy when they  used to put ketchup  on that  and then I'd come  in to change it  and I'd say  excuse me  there's ketchup  on this  he goes  you asked for ketchup  I said  why would I ask  for ketchup  I hate ketchup  on eggs  why would I  forget that I hate it  ketchup brings  the whole thing  together  you're a communist 
[01:00:00]  man  ketchup is for people  who only want to  taste ketchup  no matter what  the fucking food is  it's all very  very tangy  that tastes like  ketchup  that's good  I might go with  ketchup on  potatoes and  scrambled eggs  but if you get  two eggs over easy  and you put ketchup  on it  it's just going to  look like  it's horrible  stop saying  potatoes  but  potatoes  you want some  potatoes  what do you got  potatoes in your ears  you want  we got  some more info  on the pink planet  we have to take  this call 
[01:00:30]  I'm telling you  I know you're over it  Mike in Denver  go ahead Mike  I heard that they  found that there's  two in that pink  and if you turn  around there's  probably one  on the other side  Uranus  see  see what I did  there  oh very good  yes  one in the pink  so one in Uranus  and the other  right  in the pink  that was brilliant  dude  fucking brilliant  did you guys see  the 60 minutes  with the Pink Panther  fucking bandits  on there  these are my  favorite thieves 
[01:01:00]  of all time  they're the guys  that'll just ride  into a mall  on  they'll fucking  just blast through  into a jewelry store  60 seconds  boom  they're in and out  no one can stop them  and they've got like  60, 70  goddamn robberies  that's movie shit  no one can stop them  that's movie shit  they're in and out too fast  they're in and out too fast  plus  they're ex-military  and then they take it back  to Serbia  or some fucking place  where the EU  can't even come in  wow  and they just get back there  and they just party it up 
[01:01:30]  where have they been doing  in the states  no they've been doing it  in Europe  but they also  even went into Dubai  let's pop this up  yeah I don't want to  you know  I don't want this to turn  into another pink planet  but there's all kinds  of videos  the Pink Panthers  are the names  Operation Pink Panther  is this a good one  I bet it's not it  no I don't think so  I bet you  it's plural  plural  or else we're going to be  watching cartoons  in here  oh that artwork  someone said  Noah is not a traditional 
[01:02:00]  bible film  it's based on the story  but God isn't mentioned  once in the film  I don't know if that's true  alright  it's still a guy  with a boat full of animals  yeah yeah  with everyone else dead  silly story  they're not crashing  car  oh my god  what are you doing  Sal what are you doing  there's a documentary  on these guys  Sal  Sal  I mean I know these guys  were discovered yesterday  so that is still done 
[01:02:30]  it's done  half a billion dollars  yeah  wow  they're fucking unbelievable  they only steal diamonds  I gotta watch this  oh thank God  I'm morally safer  glory Drew  60 minutes  is just the geriatric  and they're still in the top 5  every year  this guy's the youngster  in Haiti  but they've done jobs  in 35 countries  as far as 
[01:03:00]  35 countries  Tokyo and Dubai  they are ex-Yugoslavs  many fought in the  Serbian special forces  during the Bosnian  what's wrong with his voice  they are called  the Pink Panthers  and that's not a joke  his hands are in raising  why are they pink  oh  oh  I see  as you can well imagine  there are scores  of jewelers and cops  in many countries  you can well imagine  do not find them  is he sitting in a wheelchair  the rich boys have become  the stuff of legend  but what they did in Dubai 
[01:03:30]  this could be a great story  I know  it's so boring  how do you make this boring  like that  the story  will continue  will continue  you didn't even start the story  I want to hear the Dubai part  because I want to go there  look  shh  no this is the door  in the fucking  this is like the Italian job  shit right here  drive into it  the cars into the doors  of the graph jewelry store  then men in commando gear  jumped out  ran into the shop 
[01:04:00]  the hammers  seemed perfectly relaxed  as they broke into glass cases  and bagged diamonds  worth three and a half million dollars  come on  I would just have a bag full of broken glass  like  I can't tell  and then they tried on the mall  I'd still say  he'd get a cut  he was there  to see the video of it  to believe that  they actually  it was a bomb  I can't believe this  yeah  through the mall  and then do all those  40  to add off Caesar  that's the world's chief cop 
[01:04:30]  who found it hard to believe  Ron Noble  I think  I think every man  sits around and dreams about  of course  just bank robbery  I just dream of driving through a mall  that's true  how do they not fuck up the cars  when they're smashing into the doors  they just know how to do that right too  yeah  well  you know  they're not fucking around  they come down  they train like military guys  and then boom  they're in and out  so fast  have they killed anyone  I think only one person  has ever died  oh that's  and then somebody  tried to stand between them 
[01:05:00]  and the fucking door  that's a mistake  oh really  get out of the way  get out of the way  Peter Sellers comedy  where the thief  we get to watch  the little pink panther  yeah  you know  you bring back  a little Peter Sellers stuff  yeah  you know  when they get home  their Asian  counterpart  fights them  but they put them  in the cream  they did the exact same thing  are they dead  yeah  incidentally  it was the largest jewel heist  in British history 
[01:05:30]  you know it also  they're the main suppliers  for Steven Singer jewelers  ah  the other corner  Ethan Walnut in Philly  they went to Tokyo  holy fuck  that's a good score  right there  huh  pepper spray  in front of stunned guests  three men  raced through the lobby  and into the store  they smashed glass cases  they're like  this is Johnny Knoxville  what's going on here 
[01:06:00]  wow  it's just blitzkrieg  in the last 20 years  they've been responsible  for half a billion dollars  how many guys  you think  in the operation  that's the weirdness  that they're  it's almost like  a mafia thing  only there's no habit  they franchise it out  they all just kind of work together  yeah  oh man  they look like  movie guys  yeah  these undercover shots  show a team  taking the measure  of a target  before a hit  the M.O. of the Pink Panthers  is very clear  they tend to use  this guy's never going to 
[01:06:30]  capture them  no  he doesn't stand  fucking chance  attractive woman  who's that  she's the one  that goes in the store  cases the place  they even have a hot girl  yeah  what is this  is this one of those  oceans movies  is it perfect for that  this is crazy  smash and grab men  four people  it's Fred Pitt  precise timing  look at them  fucking hammer  they break the glass  so you're breaking the window  can I help you  some irate employee  excuse me  why wasn't that guy 
[01:07:00]  covered up  he doesn't give a fuck  he's going back  to a place  that the cops  can't even come  it's like base  intact  it's like home base intact  so maybe these guys  are only doing one and done  safe  I'm safe  yeah but they're probably  spreading the money around  a little bit  you know they're probably  half gypsies  right  your allies  in the brutal  Bosnian wars  against the Muslim  what was that about  when you win sanctions  how far back  we're going to go  exactly  I think we can pull off  one of these  if we just fucking  get our heads together  we just do a radio  for five minutes 
[01:07:30]  we just do one  36 mil for  but instead of diamonds  we just go in  and steal frozen yogurt  like  orange julius  we'll knock over  an orange julius  just go in with big buckets  we need four and a half  to five minutes  to fill this bucket  one of us gets the bucket  the other three  just scream  gotta keep the pain  in the ass  innocent bystanders  scared  isn't it weird  that diamonds  are still valued  they're still valued  yeah  we still got it  why  2014  they're still 
[01:08:00]  valued  I mean I could get  back then  you know it's shiny  oh we don't have  anything shiny  now you got a fucking  plasma TV  you got the internet  there's a lot more  shiny things to look at  that's true  I mean what would you  really rather have  a smartphone  or a fucking diamond  a diamond  you can sell it  buy a shitload  of smartphones  get blown  I don't think you're  getting the point  here Jimmy  went over Jimmy's head  see  well did he go  around the point  I think he did 
[01:08:30]  something interesting  he got around the point  we got a guy  who has a relative  that works for Interpol  AJ in Brooklyn  AJ  I thought that was  a movie police thing  I smell bacon  AJ  hey gentlemen  so the group  that Ronnie  how you doing buddy  nice to have you  on the radio  he's on the radio  every day  is that exactly  not on the Opie  and Anthony channel  it's the only channel  I listen to pal  what about Raw Dog  you gotta give Ronnie  a taste  I will  I will  Ronnie  I love 
[01:09:00]  don't bother  he's got replays  to listen to  that's true  I love the replays  I love  oh Christ  a right  this doesn't help  Ronnie though  get it  thank God  Noon Raw Dog  what's the matter  with you  I'm fucked over there  I'm fucked  Raw Dog will be on  Raw Dog will be on  so this is the same  group of guys  it's 14 guys  and they are from Serbia  but they're led by  two ex-American military guys  I love that  they actually work with  no joke  they're ex-marines 
[01:09:30]  that are running  this whole group  across Europe  they definitely  outstanding  they do six months  they go in  they case the joint  they knock it off  and it disappears  for six months  they go to  case the joint  he's using like  yeah he's a really  great lingo  they case the joint  you obviously watch  Freebie and the Bean  Jimmy and then Columbo  comes out  and says  the guy took the knife  out of the butter  it's Kevin Pollack  yeah that was pretty good  that was a great impression  that was a darn good 
[01:10:00]  Peter Falk  oh I thought he was doing  the Bambino  at the end of his life  that was  not good  is this going to make  diamonds more expensive  for us  are we going to have to  pay more  you just buy those  blood diamonds  those are the  I love those  inexpensive  beautiful  cares  right I don't care  how they get them  I don't care  it's far away from here  we don't care  it's a far away misery  I'm not the one  who lopped the arm off  just the one  trying to get laid  with this thing  even if it happened  in Cleveland  we wouldn't care  I don't care  if they're hobbling 
[01:10:30]  people in Philly  you'd still buy it  oh yeah  how else are you  going to get  cheap diamonds  but you know  in a lot of ways  I even think  there's blood donuts  out there  I think most  places that you go  they push  and push  and push  until someone  gets hurt  you know  it's terrible  the atrocities  going on in this world  it happens  you know  you want to build  a bridge  someone's going to die  you know  that's what's going to happen  yes 
[01:11:00]  it's a sad day  for pastries  by the way  why is that  they're closing down  the entrance  entrance  place on Long Island  the main place  why  it's big news  on Long Island  big news  I drive fast there  going to the mall  and stuff  people who aren't  buying the entrance  people don't want  wax donuts anymore  you don't like that  fucking high sheen donut  that chocolate donut  is like they put it  on a buffing wheel  I love it  I love those donuts  it's great  but he's right  they must add wax 
[01:11:30]  to the chocolate  for whatever reason  you could fix your hair  in one of those donuts  they're fantastic  I love those donuts  I took it back  I go this is not dry enough  I don't know  I worked my way  through the hard wax  and then it wasn't dry enough  inside  it really is  a horrible donut  I think that's why  people started dunking  you know what I mean  let me try to get some life  let me get some moisture  this donut  I feel like I'm in a desert  so it's going to be done  it's going to be gone  I don't know what this means  because this is the main place 
[01:12:00]  I guess  you don't like the coffee cake  with the chocolate in it  I like that too  no no no  classic coffee cake  I like classic coffee cake  but I like so  stop messing around  with the recipe  we're good  I remember when we used to  go over to the DeLuca's house  out there in Queens  when I was a kid  mom and dad would always  bring a crumb cake  a nice crumb cake  we'd sit down  and a crumb for a son  I never knew  what they were talking about  either  they'd hang out for hours  at the table  just drinking coffee  smoking cigarettes  and just talking 
[01:12:30]  would you go down  to the factory  to get cheaper  no  we did  you actually got  Entenmann's  from the  from the Entenmann's  factory  you went down there  and it was a lot cheaper  the whole area  smells nice too  in the summer  when the windows are down  you drive past  you're like  hey what's  smells like a donut  wonderful  let's play the news clip  it's big news for Long Island  local  we're going local  oh boy  yeah jeez  it's old  pretty much

[01:17:00]  your run of the mill  burglary  she's a nice lady  she's having  heavy equipment  it took just minutes  for the suspects  to get in and out  of the jewelry center  in Paramus  Dre Clark  is there  Dre  Shade  not only were  these guys bold  they were extremely  determined to get  what they want  take a look at this  parking lot  it is very well lit  get the fingertips  cut out of his gloves  okay  and inside that store  cameras are everywhere 
[01:17:30]  yet that did not  stop them from  making their move  right through that  area right there  at night  and boy oh boy  did he just say  that didn't stop us  from making our move  I was going to say  yeah  he wants everyone to know  he didn't do it  burglars using extreme  measures to steal  precious jewels  precious jewels  that looks like  flea market shit  yeah  in Paramus  they're very gutsy  and I guess they have  nothing to lose  and then they know  they're very professional  he fucking did it  for the insurance  and dragged a safe  out the store  using a steel cable  connected to the truck 
[01:18:00]  wow  outside they used  the backhoe  to lift the safe  wow  and dump it  into another vehicle  it takes a lot  of guts and grit  to do so  and pull something  like the soft  they were in and out  within two minutes  the police say  they got away  with $250,000  worth of jewelry  that was locked  inside the safe  jump change  right there  oh they made a mess  the damage  inside the store  and notice the pickup truck  they left behind  in the store parking lot 
[01:18:30]  they leave a backhoe  that's going to be  worth more than  $250,000  they lost money  on the steel  you took the backhoe  we forgot the backhoe  shit  you can sell that  for a few bucks  like they can't  trace where it came from  no you just steal it  they probably stole it  how do you steal a backhoe  I don't know  slowly go down route 4  until you get to  the jewelry store  maybe there's one  in the parking lot  for something else already  but imagine if that  was your job  in that whole heist  to drive the backhoe away 
[01:19:00]  it's an hour later  you're still in the parking lot  slowly leaving  everyone else is  fucking popping champagne  and high-fiving  you're freaking out  because it's starting to rain  there's nothing in that cab  the cops hear the beeping sound  when you try to back into an alley  to hide  it's just terrible  what a plan  any more on this story  is that it  probably  just calculated  the jewelry center owner  says the burglars  knew they were being  reported by the stores  oh yeah  it's done  we got the facts  that's all we need 
[01:19:30]  yeah  wow  alright  some brazen criminals  out there  brazen  yeah  Ron Bennington is here  oh yeah  maybe after the next break  you could  you know  announce why he's here  there's a reason  yes  oh I didn't hear anything  gigantic reason  but the weird  the reason is weird  what do you mean  because we could just do it now  if you think about it  that's hilarious  we could just do it now  without all the hullabaloo  no not the announcement  what he  I know  we could just do it now 
[01:20:00]  yeah yeah  alright we'll explain next  got Ron Bennington in studio  we have a guy  that's been waiting  40 minutes  just to talk to you Ron  wow  let's see what Clayton needs here  Clayton  Clayton  you waited 40 minutes  what's up  yeah 40 minutes  I've asked Ron's advice  3 times in 10 years  he never steered me wrong  oh  when did they did  blood limits  met a girl  hung out there twice 
[01:20:30]  both times  between  12am  and 5am  and in the last week  she's popped in  no call  no text  just showed up  at my house  oof  but pop in  twice  once in the middle of the night  I woke up to her  poking me in the ribs  and holding my hand  holy shit  that's frightening  this isn't the vice  I think is bragging  you know what I mean  it is  he's kind of digging this  that's play misty for me  shit  oh man  waking up and she's there  like that  that's a little creepy 
[01:21:00]  how does she get in  yeah  she came in my back door  well how about you lock  lock your back door  see that's wrong  see I wouldn't do that  that's a little gag  that is  what uh  yeah why don't you lock your doors  what's the matter with you  I live in a fucking country  I don't have neighbors or anything  well you got a stalker  you have a stalker  I got a legit fucking stalker  oh yeah  so then lock the doors  yeah  he digs it  he loves it  and so did Clint Eastwood  in Play Misty 
[01:21:30]  I fucking loved it  and by the way  that movie is so bullshit  because no fucking jazz DJ  ever had a chick get arrested  it just never happened  it is  you never wrote your own poetry though  what do you mean  what do you mean it's bullshit  I gotta write some poetry  poetry for my show  for my show  his show prep  can you find that clip  it's so uncomfortable  writing some poetry for my show  I haven't seen that in so long  that was so bad  it's a horrible movie  that's not a good movie  to fall asleep to either  because she starts screaming 
[01:22:00]  and then he's terrible  that scream is horrendous  it goes right through you  he's suddenly rude for the guys  from Sudden Impact  to come and fucking take care of her  so what's the question  for Ronnie there Clayton  yeah  I don't know what to do  like I'm afraid to break up  with her  like she's gonna flip out  I don't know what to do  she'd fucking be a man  that's my wife  break up with her  Wade  I mean it ends  with her leaving  and that's fucking whatever  but man  I say marry her  marry her  you got someone who cares  yeah make it official  yeah  that was my last 
[01:22:30]  that was the last advice  you gave me  was to leave it alone  after 10  I fucking  I split up my wife  and he told me  just fuck off  basically  you really  know how to handle  the women folk  yeah  well I mean  I figure they're fucking  everything's  ever since I fixed  boss's marriage  now  people come to me  for advice  yeah  for marriage advice  that's true  pretty good  anyway  can I do something  Jimmy quick  go ahead buddy  look at you  around the table  I know it's a little late  but when you came to Harrisburg  I told everyone about you 
[01:23:00]  for like weeks before  when you finally showed up  what do you want money  you want a check  yeah exactly  that's exactly what I want  wait what happened  when I finally showed up  what  Harrisburg  you came to Harrisburg  you were on the west shore  Harrisburg  I told everyone about you  for weeks or whatever  and you finally showed up  it was like you know  that kid's fucking girlfriend  from Niagara Falls  shows up at the dance  and no one expects her to  you're a big hit  people fucking love you  out here now  one of your fans  huh Ronnie  appreciate it  thank you buddy  me and Jimmy  you're splitting them  right now  yeah  Ronnie and I kind of 
[01:23:30]  clunk heads over  who can claim Harrisburg  alright Clayton  I have Scranton  you know what I mean  and everything east  yeah Wilkes-Barre  has been mine for years  it's untakable  great phone call  from Clayton  thank you  good stuff  good stuff right there  see you during  year season  Ron what do we got  going on buddy  oh boy  I don't have the info  in front of me  by the way  so I'm not going  to be able to fill  in the blanks  I don't think  you know you guys  got the 20 years  yes  oh boy  20 years  20 years  together 
[01:24:00]  since the first show  we have great quotes  about it too  because they need quotes  what can I quote  you come up with  Ron is here to fire you  by the way  that's the thing  give me a watch  Ann's quote had  yada yada yada  in it  and my quote  no it was etc  etc  and then I just told  Wiki you fill in  the blanks  I think he added  yada yada yada  I don't want  Don to be more  excited about your  anniversary than you  he's extremely excited  he is  he's really happy  about this 
[01:24:30]  I like we're  acknowledging it  for the channel  because it just gives  us an excuse  to play old stuff  something to run with  I wrote something  like we ran out of  things to talk about  years ago  let's get this shit  over with  but he wouldn't let  me say shit  in a quote  so  where's it going  where's the quote  exactly  what do you think  the AP is going  to run with it  he goes  Scott Greenstein  I'm like  where's the quote  everything has to be  approved  Scott's still here  I guess  before he goes out  oh ok  everything's got to  be approved  that's cool  we're due for our 
[01:25:00]  once a year meeting  with Scott Greenstein  where he says  I got it a lot  I got it  I got it  I got it  nothing happens  he got it alright  yeah  he got it doc  what about our money  I got it  I got it  I got it  yeah exactly  oh he's the worst  I did start negative  really fast  I mean I really was  here for a really  nice positive  he's just the worst  reason  he doesn't  empty promises  my god  yeah  anyway sorry  I'm going to do this  on a different day  you know what I mean 
[01:25:30]  you want to come back  another day  it's tainted  yeah  but are you guys  at least a little  sentimental about the  20 years  um  yeah I guess  I don't know  that's weird  how much has changed  in 20 years  I look back fondly  yeah  on 20 years  sure  you know  made history  Ronnie  is that right  we made history  they look back fondly  the way Julia Roberts  looked back on the  beginning of her marriage  and sleeping with the enemy  I actually thought 
[01:26:00]  that guy was okay though  I did too  he was neat  sloppy bitch he was  he was  he turned all the cans  in the correct direction  I think of it more  as Hitler must have  looked back in the bunker  thinking of better times  you do  that's  I'm sure  20 years in radio  you have more room  than this  20 years in radio  really  I did 10 before that  is that right  you did 10 years  before that  before that  you did 10 years 
[01:26:30]  before you guys met  college  and what not  how long were you  at BAB  three  I started professionally  in  I don't know  86  87  somewhere around there  professionally  I was on the radio  and in 94  so yeah  6 or 7 years  Motorola  in the truck  16 to base  I'm going to Granger  I'm picking up that pump  the condensate pump  well the  well the thought here  was to  get everybody together  for the 20 years  and 
[01:27:00]  for the first time  you guys get together  and seriously talk about it  a little bit  in an Unmasked episode  there we go  there we go  the Unmasked  which I believe  gives you that  stamp  of approval  it's kind of the  hall of fame  it really is  for comedy  so you've run out of  people to talk to  is what you're saying  not at all  okay  not at all  we're still shooting  for Gervais  you know  wait you still  he hasn't done it  he hasn't done it yet  why are we doing  he says he's going to  no they haven't done it  you've never done it Unmasked 
[01:27:30]  no  us  yeah  Jimmy was there  right at the beginning  I did mine in DC  in 2006  we did some weird thing  when we first got to  what's his name  with George Taylor Morris  rest his soul  the pre-town hall  yes  whatever it was called  before town hall  that was fun though  I enjoyed that  well this would be cool  to get everybody together  and  taking it out of the building here  to Caroline's  on Broadway  oh yeah 
[01:28:00]  inviting the listeners  and coming out  because  this actually  Don actually said this  he goes  you know  they never really talk  about their career  it's a really interesting thing  no  never do  we talk about it every day  when we run out of material  but this way  I'm gonna  I've already looked into this  I've got my people on it  and I don't want to give away  too much  but  some of the unwanted pregnancies  some of the old  you know what I mean  that stuff is going to come up  oh yeah 
[01:28:30]  unwanted pregnancies  oh boy  I don't want to save it  save it  the abortion  yeah  the abortion stuff  yeah yeah  okay  all the stuff  we went back to  all the stars  yeah  the awkward teen years  right  braces  both on teeth and legs  that's an awkward stage  you have to go through that  really  oh okay  I didn't realize  I didn't realize  there were abortions  that's  see this is why  a mask is so great 
[01:29:00]  okay then  that's what makes  so I don't want to  fucking give it away now  but you're going to be  blown away  that's just  but the number of them  the sheer  number  you're not supposed to use it  as birth control  but you know  what are you going to do  sometimes  it's the only choice  now in hindsight  it all worked out  for the best  they didn't have  the plan B  back then  would you  there are going to be  all kinds of stuff  but I don't have  the exact date  in front of me  I think it's  April 16th  hold on a second  I'll explain a second  I think  oh 
[01:29:30]  I have it in my  Carolines  and I know  if you can go over  to the iBang  where I have stuff up  but we're going to  have to figure out  how we're going to  give out tickets  there's going to be  like a lottery drawing  because this is  the excitement  in the building  is unbelievable  right now  they are  palpable  is that it  wait what the fuck  is the date  live unmasked  in New York City  there it is  oh it's  April 17th  a Thursday  at 5 o'clock  oh  and then  you guys will 
[01:30:00]  meeting  and greeting  and signing  and it's going to be  a day of love for you  oh yeah  we don't really do  public appearances  anymore  it's been a long time  so this will be good  I think a lot of listeners  are going to want to attend  I was surprised  let's go to a bigger  venue then  yeah we should  crack it open  and really  I would love to go to  town hall  if you want to do that  oh boy  let's go to a bigger  fucking room  oh boy  we could go to  Madison Square Garden  once a month  like Billy Joel  yeah  I have no problem  fucking over Caroline's  I mean  well just because 
[01:30:30]  we can hang and do  stuff after  right  you can do something  after instead of  being out of there  because there's an  early show  I love the Caroline's  it's great  I'm thinking though  we can maybe go  a little bigger  really  a little bit  I think Caroline's  would be nice though  a little intimate setting  yeah  yeah  but you have to be out  by a certain time  dude I'm not even sure  we can sell it out  let's just be careful  let's slow down  before we start bragging  I know  the phones aren't exactly  blowing up on this  right now  I'm starting to worry  you got a lot of money  invested in this  we got to have an engineer  out there  I think that's where 
[01:31:00]  we're at with our careers  I think the whole audience  can be Caroline's  we had a good run though  right  you gotta admit  we saw the mountaintop  you and I  like we said  with that Boston  and Bonnie show  that we were hanging out  we started to look  at the excitement  of podcasting  yeah  which is odd  when you figure  do radio  I think that's a  strong possibility  at this point  hey  Don Geronimo's  doing it now  and it's a  one like  he sold me  a hundred bucks  a year  we're good with Don  really 
[01:31:30]  a hundred bucks a year  a hundred bucks a year  just for one guy  instead of  all these  right  fucking people  you know  now I'm going to have to  give you it up  this right here  there's no overhead  I have one question  about the Rich and Bonnie thing  John Master did  for them  Fezzy sat in between me  and my wife for a while  did he really?  is he that awkward?  that he couldn't figure that out?  I had no idea  this  because that was date night  for you guys  I saw you earlier  a rare date night 
[01:32:00]  yeah  we got two kids  it's very hard to find  babysitting  it was the first time  I've seen your chick  in years  as a matter of fact  they put us in a booth  and then Fezzy  like  she went in  and then Fezzy went in  and then me  and I'm like  who would do this?  oh wow  maybe he thought you were  coming in the other side though  and I never brought  I forgot to bring it up  to the guys  coming in the other side  don't talk about that  that's gay  no is it possible  she gets in  Fez gets in  thinking you're going  in the other side  no  it was against the wall 
[01:32:30]  thank you  against the wall  so it only has one in  and then he kind of  finally understood  and said he had to go  find you  I think he felt  the uncomfortableness  but he brought that  he brought that  upon himself  you should just ask him  hey could you move  no it was so weird  I just let it be  for a while  because I'm like  what's he doing  he always thought  this would make a good  on their story  I'll say right here  so tell us  how you felt  at that moment  hold on  he's crying somewhere  right now  I can hear it 
[01:33:00]  nah we're going  with Fez right  I don't know  I don't know  we go with Fez  these days  oh absolutely  oh good  absolutely  will Fez be at the event  he will be at the event  that means he'll have  a new contract  oh  well that's what  he's beloved  he's actually beloved  he is beloved  he  I'm telling you right now  I know that Tim  likes them more than me  and you guys  because that's good  because Tim has a  list in his office  of people that he 
[01:33:30]  actually likes the best  yeah  Fez is way up there  wow  that doesn't change  on a daily basis  on an hourly basis  yeah  what are you trying to say  I don't know  you know  his brain's like a  merry-go-round  it's just  Jesus  it's just manic  he  when  when we were  going over  the watch thing  I love the guy  I love the Tim  the phone  in the office 
[01:34:00]  the other day  he came  like screaming  up to the door  like Kramer  just sliding in  it's like Doc Brown  so unmasked  April 17th  a little more negativity  at Caroline's  you can't handle  this negativity  no  because this is a  positive time  20 years in the  business  we've been good  lately Rod  you'd be proud  we don't bitch  as much  how come  you give it up  I mean 
[01:34:30]  I think  I think  listener finally  made the point  like look  stop bitching  if you guys  can't change  things  so if you can't  change things  what are you  going to do  I know this  part of it's fun  so fuck it  submit  submit  that's the thing  to do  well  but  if you don't  do anything  about it  then you look  like the  idiot  so we gotta  try to figure it out  what could you do  we fucking  go offline  and do this  ourselves  that's what you do  is that the only  next option  there's a couple  others actually  that are interesting 
[01:35:00]  at this point  is it reasonable  it's very reasonable  these guys  because I mean  they don't care  they just don't care  they don't care  I said the other day  they don't care  if we have an amazing  show  and they don't care  if we have a shitty  show  so if we weren't  motivated we could  really just sit here  and just rot  I've done that  I've done that  on this fucking  exact channel  oh here's a song  I like  oh shit  remember the PD's  would be on your ass  I mean that sucked too 
[01:35:30]  don't get me wrong  but the hotlining  you got hotlined  back in the day  right  see our thing  my thing down in Florida  blew up so fast  that they had lost  control of us  really quickly  that's nice  I mean it had blown up  even before I'd  signed my first contract  we got that at  NAW  yeah  in Boston  we were still  getting hotlined  we had this  this PD  whose wife  hated us  because she was  very religious  so he was torn  and he would just  be waiting outside  the studio  to wait for that  light to go off 
[01:36:00]  so he could yell at us  we got yelled at  almost every day  you knew she'd tell him  like when he went home  I don't  and then we'd be  hotlined by  the GM  and then the GM  was wiretapping  so he could listen  to our conversations  when we weren't  on the air  this is why our mess  is going to be so great  really  this is going to be great  Anthony  material  one of my favorite  stories about the wire  we've been wiretapped  a bunch  by the way  there's a guy  here that wiretapped us  and he knows  we hate his fucking guts  because it was the Dave Herman lawsuit  and this guy was  pally pally with Dave Herman 
[01:36:30]  and we were being sued  along with the company  so this guy was taping us  secretly in the production room  trying to get some  dirt on us  for the lawsuit  yeah  but anyway  going back to Boston  Bruce Mittman  set up this thing  where in his car  he could just  call a phone number  and then he could hear  what we're saying  on these mics  when they weren't on  I didn't even know  you could do that  back then  now we know  yeah  and finally  how did we figure it out  by the way  we went into the closet  we found the phone number  why would we even do that 
[01:37:00]  I don't know  we would unplug  the phone line  I wish I remembered why  for that  because Ed figured it out  Ed goes  he's taping us  and he went into  some kind of closet  electronic closet  and we pulled the phone line  out for the show  and then plug it back in  and he knew that we knew  but no one talked about it  and he would give us  these looks like  you son of a bitch  see now just think  you could have sued  that fucking place  oh yeah  for a fortune  you never even had  to do radio  although could you though  if you sign a contract  that says everything you say  is being recorded 
[01:37:30]  you might sign that  right away  I know that  that happened with one show  as a joke  they fucking picked  regular guys  yeah  and they were able to  no no no  to somebody on the staff  like their version  of fucking Sam  or EROC  was being teased  by the rest of the staff  and they were taping him  without him knowing  and he sued  made some real money  wow really  against the old law  I forgot why  but I think  I think like  Bruce said something  one day  and we went  how the fuck  did he know that 
[01:38:00]  and then we  light bulbs went up  and our heads  like what  wait a minute  yeah  and then that's when  Ant started doing  a little snooping  like what  and I remember  it was part of our  day to day routine  that you would go  in that closet  and pull that light  but put it back in  when we were done  so Bruce was taping you  the guy used light  yeah we like him  we have a love hate  for the guy  I mean he  he supported us  big time  as far as our  on air content went  but he had no problem  really fucking us  money wise  no problem 
[01:38:30]  no suit  fucking cares about that  right  they don't care  no they don't  so that's a story  we can't tell  on April 17th  you know like  when you were younger  didn't you  that's well yeah  that's gone now  I know  we just burned that one  that would have been good  we'll save our stairway  to heaven  I really just want  to do more  personal stories  right  really  forget the  the storied career  that you have  right  just awful things  that happen  in your personal life  right  the personal stories  behind the 20 years 
[01:39:00]  I better go two hours  then  oh boy  we got an hour each  on that easily  for reals  it's going to be  a lot of fun though  it will be  I don't doubt it  Ronnie B Hotline  story in DC  you want to take this  I'm pretty sure  I know what that one is  uh oh  who's the PD  I can't remember his name  but I threatened to  fucking hit him  with a fucking phone  this guy knows  sometimes I lose my temper  Matty in Jersey  gentlemen how are you  hey  oh great  so when he was in DC 
[01:39:30]  this was right after  Fez's grandmother  had died  and he was starting  to cry on the air  and everything  and to motivate Fez  they started talking  about wrestling  for an hour  uh  the  she got hotlined  and the producer  came in  and said something  to Ron  and on a dime  Ron lost it  and started screaming  at  on air  at the actual  producer  good for Ron  good for Ron  who was the PD  Cameron Gray  oh yeah 
[01:40:00]  I remember Cameron  so I  obviously  this guy thought  that  he was a new  PD  he thought  he was  you know  it was all so exciting  to him at the time  he really thought  that he had some control  right  you know  it's so freeing  in hindsight  none of that matters  it's so freeing  when you just decide  not to listen  to the PD  but see  I came up  in an age  where people  would actually  get physical  right  you know what I mean  like we used to get  fucking physical  throw shit  right  and knock their  fucking desk over  and shit 
[01:40:30]  and start breaking  flip desks  because everyone  was on cocaine  you had to get  some of that energy  some of that  some of that  but you know  you had to get up  early in the morning  it's not like today  when you can start  at 630  I'm talking about  a 6 o'clock show  right  right  be part of the unmasked  yeah  the time shift  and why  yes  okay  see it's gonna be  exciting  I got 20 minutes  on that  how long  do we have to  fill  an hour  we're gonna do  an hour  okay  do we have to  do stand up  before  like they made  Rich and Bonnie  do  that was very 
[01:41:00]  strange  wasn't it  it kind of  worked though  I don't know  why  it was  actually a fun  night  I enjoyed it  a lot  but you know  what  as much as  I think  those guys  are so great  separately  together  they are so  fucking funny  yeah  yeah  they really  should have  some kind of  show  yeah  their regular  life is a show  yeah  they're like  the new Burns  and Allen  so what happened  you ran after  the guy  for real  who's that  the PD  did we get  the end of the story  I was gonna  beat him with a  fucking phone  I said it  on the ass  in his hometown 
[01:41:30]  don't fuck  with your content  don't fuck  with what you're  doing with your show  I remember  early on  there was  and our ratings  in Florida  got really  fucking big  and we got  a new PD  I forget  where we  fucked this over  on something  but we were  at a live gig  in front of  all these people  and I was  so fucking  mad at him  that I made  him hold on  to my belt  loop  wherever I  walked  like scared  straight  oh shit  it was so  awful  we were so  fucking terrible  my bitch  and he actually  did it  he fucking  held on 
[01:42:00]  and I  would  just humiliate  him  now looking  back  you're like  what is wrong  with you  when you're  younger  that's great  I remember  we're a bully  remember  you bullied him  yeah the kind  of bullies  that you see  on TV  right  we kind of  did that  to Ken  Stevens  they desperately  wanted us  to sign  back in the  day  and the deal  was amazingly  good  to be honest  with you  but we just  wanted to be  dicks  and we refused  to sign the  contract  and then  one day  I'm like  I don't know  if you come  in here  with a giant  pen  maybe we'll  sign  and then 
[01:42:30]  the guy  goes out  you know  god bless  Ken Stevens  as he  sails around  the world  wherever the  hell he is  now  yeah  remember  he came  with the  giant pen  and he  just  we would  make him  beg us  to sign  the contract  another story  burned  oh we can't  use that one  fuck  this is terrible  stop blowing  stories  let's put  this on  the end  of the  on masses  I like that  we'll do  extras  for the  dvd  the commentary  I just love  talking old  radio with  Ronnie 
[01:43:00]  because he's  seen it all  too  well you know  that'll be  that'll be  the fun thing  about it  because most  people don't  know anything  about radio  well what  happened  nothing  what are they  saying  yawn  are they really  yawning  no just  what are you  going to do  tell the story  about the  sex for  Sam  that's a good  one  we were going  to write the  book but we  had to write  about Howard  and  would have  fired us  so we  decided we  had to wait  on the book  until Mel  was out of 
[01:43:30]  the picture  so now I  guess we  could finally  write the  book  that was  XM though  before you  guys were  here  we got  some stories  well then  there was  another thing  where Bob  decided that  he needed a  big chunk  of it  because it  was his  idea  to write  a book  your life  story  he wanted  to be our  book agent  all of a sudden  you had nothing  to do with this  deal  hope Bob  to shut  his face  and then  he's like  oh you're  right  but in  hindsight  it was smart  because of  the Howard  story  sort of got us  in deep  shit  yeah true  deep shit 
[01:44:00]  yeah  was there  anything that  would have been  said that  wasn't hasn't  been said  on the air  already  nah  but they just  wanted to  fucking move  on I guess  but you know  we just know  if you're gonna  write a book  those chapters  have to be  told those  were ridiculous  some of the  shit that went  down between  the two shows  completely ridiculous  we did shitty  things too  trust me  but he did  his shitty  things as well  we literally  went to a  press conference  to be good  guys  maybe we  could get  along with  the guy  and he 
[01:44:30]  thought we  were there  to fuck  the whole  thing up  and refuse  to start  the press  conference  until we  got kicked  out in  front of  everybody  another  story  gun  yeah  I remember  that one  though  because that  was like  the day  I got to  New York  as soon as  I got here  that was the  early days  it was really  yeah  when I  just  I came  in and I  guess they  were flipping  it from the  first talk  guys they  had to the  second ones  and I heard  about that  and I'm like  what the  fuck is this  place  we weren't  doing anything  that day  we really  went there 
[01:45:00]  with good  intentions  like alright  we're working  for the same  company  let's go  check it  out  we got  our  sandwiches  we're sitting  in the  back row  even  because we  don't want  to bother  anyone  and then  all of a sudden  everyone started  looking at us  and then one  guy I remember  he turns around  and goes  hey man  you guys aren't  here to do  anything  are you  I mean  I'm like  no  don't worry  about it  not at all  and then all  of a sudden  other people  got involved  and they're like  you guys  gotta go  now  and then as  we walk  out of  where was  it  the plaza  there's  Howard's  limo  right in  front of 
[01:45:30]  the place  waiting for  us to  leave  so we  can go  in  and a  sweaty  Jeremy  ran from  any  out of  the plaza  to get  us out  of there  and he's  yelling  and screaming  at us  and Howard  called  Ken Stevens  and yelling  and screaming  at him  how dare  you  and in  the end  I swear  to you  we weren't  going to  do anything  we went  there with  good intentions  they probably  thought we  were going  to try  a slurring  John  I remember  Jeremy  showing up  out of breath  because he  had to come  and yank us  out of there  well he doesn't  run much  either  no  that was  no 
[01:46:00]  no  that was  a smart  guy  but I think  he handled  you guys  wrong  that was  a mistake  he doesn't  made that  many mistakes  but the way  he looked  at you guys  and dealt  with you guys  I thought  was a stupid  mistake  because he wound  up getting  the guys  who came  after him  the most  ferociously  were you two  right  by far  the most  ferocious  guys have  been you guys  and he probably  could have made  a friend  of you guys  many years ago  could have been  one big happy  family  yeah  us doing  afternoons  yeah whatever  I mean the company  you know 
[01:46:30]  put us together  it could have  worked  whatever  we had  we had  have a good  career  without being  you know  palsy  wowsies  with the guy  but yeah  I think so  oh and that  just pissed  us  that shit  just enraged  us  so it just  made it worse  is this what  it's going  to be like  I think  no but really  I think  that's the  company's fault  of course  that the fucking  company should  have been  doing shit  I mean  people don't  realize  there's like  less direction  in radio  than anything  else in  fucking show  business 
[01:47:00]  right  and like you  say  people yell  after the fact  but they  never have  one fucking  decent idea  right  you know  they literally  make it all  the way up  without ever  doing radio  themselves  yeah  look at the  guys that  are in charge  now  without mentioning  names but  really  it's like  having a baseball  coach that said  to you  alright  now how do  you hit  you know what  I mean  like how do  you guys get  on base  what do you  do  you hit  but sometimes  I see a button  what's that  about  it's like 
[01:47:30]  they don't  fucking get  radio  they've never  really done it  it's weird  we have so many  stories  we could just  burn all these  stories  no problem  Ronnie  yeah these are  the dull ones  anyway  forget these  you gotta get  one out of  hand before  we go to  break  one story  from the old  days  from the old  radio days  one good one  either Bruce  NEW  early exit  well  one  one  one  one  one thing  that happened  over at  NEW 
[01:48:00]  I remember  this  and it  involves  Ronnie  and Fezzy  and I think  Billy Staples  and we  were  I don't know  why we were  even there  but we  weren't on  the air  we weren't  live for some  reason  and we were  betting on the  phone callers  and how long  they'd stay on  the line  and we were  betting like  alright I got  line two  and then we'd  sit there and  wait for the  light to blink  out  and then it's  like ah  my 
[01:48:30]  and for  hours we  sat and did  this  but Ant  doesn't realize  the reason why  he doesn't know  all the details  is he used to  pound  and we would  be on the  air there  late  at night  and you know  Ant could come  just wheeling  in at any  given time  oh god  that was a  party central  but you  used to  crush  just be so  funny  and then the  next day  he goes  hey was I  over  did I come  into your  show last  night  no  it would be  like for  three hours  right 
[01:49:00]  god that  fucking was  fun for that  short time  it was  it was  amazing  I mean  we'd start  the show  at three  so I was  already  afternoon  drinking some  Sam Adams  the free  Sam's that  would come  in  the beer  thing was  hilarious  because at  first  Ant would  kind of  hide him  behind the  equipment  there'd  always be  a Budweiser  waiting for  him there  and then  the interns  one of their  jobs was to  sneak him  from our  office  keep the  beers coming  from our  office in  the refrigerator  and then  when the  ratings came 
[01:49:30]  in they  were like  who gives  a drink  beer  I was  pretty much  toasting  Ken Stevens  for the  beer  and then  we got  so out of  control  that we  we've told  this story  a lot on  the air  but we  hired  shot  girls  for  shows  they had  a dress  like they  would  at their  bar gigs  and they  were  that was  a regular  thing  what a  pisser  I mean  it was  more fun  almost  off air  than what  was going  on  we  couldn't  wait  for  to go  into  one of  those  long 
[01:50:00]  15  minute  commercial  breaks  to go  play  foosball  and do  whatever  you know  that place  was like  a fucking  movie  you know  what I mean  like  that was  the movie  version  of radio  yeah  it was  like  animal  house  the fucking  radio  station  yes  it does  make me  sad  what this  has become  not our  show  necessarily  because I  think we're  still doing  it  we're just  doing it  differently  but what  this could  be and  what we  did  all you  had to  do is  go hey  I want  to come  up today  all right  come on  up join  the party  outside the  studio  you know  we did  not have  because the 
[01:50:30]  pre 9-11  there wasn't  even anyone  on the front  door  you could  just  walk in  bang on  the door  and we'd  open it  and people  listeners  would come  in  and we  would  we  would  go into  work  three or  four hours  before our  shift  early  if we're  here  15 minutes  before  yeah  and if we're  here five  minutes after  that's that's  a lot  we would hang  after the  show  for hours  we'd all go to  the office  and just  more drinking  and the party would  continue there  smoking  that used to  happen with 
[01:51:00]  that all the  time  is that we  didn't even  know he was  there he was  back playing  video games  drinking and  then he'd just  come wandering  in  a couple hours  we had the  place to  ourselves  that was a  mistake the  company made  we needed  full-time  supervision  as much as  guys like us  don't want  it  looking back  we absolutely  needed it  and maybe  someone that  understood us  you know  it's like  where's Ken  always in  D.C.  your boss is  hundreds of  miles away  and Ken  understood us  I wouldn't  mind him as  a full-time 
[01:51:30]  GM over  there  he was one  of the better  ones we've  had over the  years  but like  Anne said  he had to  go D.C.  for a day  Philly  for two  days  New York  for a day  and maybe  a half  because he wanted  to get back  on that train  early Friday  to get home  to his family  remember when  he'd wheel his  luggage in  right  he was leaving  he never even  yeah he was  living out  out of suitcases  and then he would  get to New York  and remember  I never saw  anyone else  do this  he had his  back to the  fucking door 
[01:52:00]  he had his  desk  facing in the  other direction  with his  back to the  door  anti-social  motherfucker  right  yeah  I liked him  in the end  though man  I liked  Ken a lot  but yeah  the refrigerators  we started  with one  we had  three in  our office  because then  the beer guys  were fighting  over us  like hey man  when you're  drinking your  beers on  I didn't  really drink  that much  actually on  there  it was more  amp  but  they wanted  you to be  saying oh  I'm drinking  a Sam Adams 
[01:52:30]  oh I'm  drinking a  Heineken  oh I'm  drinking a  Budweiser  yeah  and they  were fighting  and they  would come  in with  pallets of  beer on a  regular basis  to our  office  and then  the soft  drink people  would come  in like  Sobe  came in  with a  giant  refrigerator  full of  Sobe  next time  they showed  up it was  full of  beer  anything  that got  the least  cold  we would  throw beer  in it  it was like  remember all  the smoking  in our office  and naked  girls on the  windowsills  and this  wasn't the  radio show  no  club stinky  was going 
[01:53:00]  club stinky  in the  stairwell  imagine if  we had  smoking the  reefers  imagine if  we had  twitter and  all that  back down  the stuff  we would  have  we'd be  fired  or arrested  that would  have been  bad  those pictures  should never  get out  we had the  kodak  fucking  little  disposable  cameras  that we'd  snap under  the desk  when chicks  would come  in and  we'd get  upscarred  shots  but then we  were scared  to develop  that  remember  we'd  weren't  sure  what was  on it  because these  cameras 
[01:53:30]  would be  laying  around  you know  I know  what I  took  with the  camera  let's get  it developed  and you'd  open the  envelope  and start  wincing  peeling them  off slow  trying to see  if you have  a straight  I remember  that night  it was  fucking crazy  that was  crazy shit  I would  drive home  like  hammered  I shouldn't  have been  driving  all the way  back to  so that's  the  point  well  of course  you made  it  well  those were  the days  we just  didn't want  to go  home  which I think  helped with  our success 
[01:54:00]  we talked  about this  we were uber  focused  we talked  about this  when I'd  come home  and the  ex-wife  would have  the candles  lit  I'd pull  up to the  house  and Opie's  like  oh  I'm sorry  I don't  think I've  ever felt  better  for a human  being  watching you  look at  those candles  in the  why did she  have to tell  the neighborhood  that it was  sex night  it was romantic  night  you know  but she would  put the candles  in the window  like it's  Christmas time  like fucking  like what is  the neighborhood  Paul Revere  praying to an 
[01:54:30]  Italian saint  yes  I remember the  first time  it was terrible  I remember the  first time  you told me  that  I'm like  what's up  with the  candles  and he  just sighed  like  oh  god  I'm like  oh  it means  it's romance  night  and all I do  is like  I'd walk  in the door  hi  and I just  like sneak  a look  at my computer  and think  I just want  to play  fucking video  games  you wouldn't  be looking  forward to  love making  no  because she  wanted to have  a baby too  so I'd fake  that I came  jack off in the  toilet  I'd be like 
[01:55:00]  oh  oh  I hope  that one  took  fucking  I don't  want a baby  with her  fuck no  thank Christ  I didn't  oh  5pm  what is  Don Wicklund  just writes  5pm  oh  April 17th  I think  we did  5 o'clock  oh you did  say that  April 17th  here's our  here's our  shot girls  here's some  of our  shot girls  and then we  made them  topless  and this  wasn't even  on the air  they would  just be  outside the  studio  look at that  look how hot  that one is  yeah  shit  I mean you 
[01:55:30]  and then they  would have to  take their tops  off to serve  yellow shots  they're bartenders  making mojitos  right in front of  the world's largest  rock and roll  library  that we destroyed  we destroyed  that as well  look at carts  there's fucking carts  carts  this looks like  it's from the  1950s  instead of  fucking 12 years  ago  Alan Freed  where do we go  for these pictures  we were spinning  hot wax  right  on a show  on twitter  oh you guys  are putting  the links up  keep going  yep  oh my god  jimmy  imagine that 
[01:56:00]  with radio  we're going to be  shooting this up  on screens behind  you when we're  doing the unmasks  we should  we should  that was a radio  show  oh jimmy  she's bending  over to get ice  look at that  big nipples  ooh  one on the right  is a little rough  look joe curry  joe curry  wow look at joe  i thought that was  rolling  yeah right  oh and then we  put her on the  console  oh god  god knows  probably a little  spanking  spanking and radio  hand in hand  yeah it did 
[01:56:30]  love the good  smell  it's stinky  stinky  love you  miss you brother  he's down the hole  oh  he doesn't want to be  called stinky anymore  no  it's stinky  but you know what  we're grandfathered  this guy  you can call him  stinky  what is that  these are just  strangers  we don't know  most of these people  people could just  wander in that place  right  kissing  oh he's licking  something off her back  is that old dirty  might be  not old dirty bastard  we had a guy named 
[01:57:00]  old dirty  no that might  and then who's in the  back on the right  oh i don't know  i swear i don't know  any of these faces  look like he's in the  cop for a second  no not that guy  yeah  so  go to  oh and a show  we're putting up  some old  some old pictures  that was completely  acceptable  yes  it was completely  yeah that was  within the boundaries  right  and i remember  imagine that now  the company  the one thing  the company made us do  was just put a note  on that one door  that led to the area  then  and then  the area finally  led to the studio 
[01:57:30]  there was a little buffer  we had to put a note  that's a buffer  you might see naked people  yeah  that's all  that's all we had to do  now  if we look at  because we're looking at this  someone isn't doing their job  they're supposed to close the curtains  oh whatever  yeah just to get someone  walks by  and sees something on the monitor  yeah  that's the protocol now  if we're looking at  naked girls on the computer  they'd close the curtains  we used to have nudity  all over the fucking place  i'm going to hr  after this  i'm going to say this is  yeah  upsetting  i came in as a guest 
[01:58:00]  i was very upset by this  she's fucking sexy man  the one between the guys  she is right  i know  look at that  she is really  she has them big juicy heavy tits  she's probably 40 now  i know  i think of that too  that's probably 2000  that is crazy  yeah probably  you guys are almost probably wearing  2001  close to the exact same shirts  the first photo i took with you  oh yeah  right in front of that  and even now  even now  it's close to the same shirts  ah what are you going to do  what are you going to do  gta  right  grab that hoodie today  what are you going to do  it's friday 
[01:58:30]  yeah  dress down  oh there's one other story  where is the curtains by the way  if you're keeping tabs at home  oh the  one last story  um  and then  they finally  replaced the rug  do you remember  the day  they replaced the rug  yes  oh yeah  this rug was horrendous  and they finally did the right thing  i think we start bitching  you gotta fucking at least  give us a new rug  it stunk  it was  and then  how did we pay him back  we made a couple  fuck in the corner  to chris  in the new rug  and then we weren't even 
[01:59:00]  paying attention to them  and barry williams  was in  he's like  we're not going to talk  about the fact that  that couple's having sex  in the corner  but we saw so much stuff  on our regular basis  like oh yeah  they're doing that  we're doing this over here  it was like motley crew  you know i mean  like the motley crew tour bus  so  anyway  i think we just sold  the uh the unmasked  for everybody  the unmasked is going to be  a lot of fun  i'm glad you guys are  i'm psyched  april 17th  i think a lot of listeners  are going to be excited  see somebody's called already 
[01:59:30]  can i get tickets  for unmasked  i don't want them  i don't like anybody  that pushy  they're too eager  they don't have any respect  for the process  right  april 17th  5 o'clock  carolines unmasked  uh me anthony  and jim norton  of course  uh with  i really think  you guys should  i'm gonna be there  no no i really mean  i'm not being fake humble  i really think  that you guys should  uh no  should do that  i'm gonna be there  and enjoying it  but i think  that you guys  should cover it  well i think  the angle  what  no no but i've done  i've done  you should tell a story  and told his 
[02:00:00]  i told mine  the angle is to  like bring you up  during the jimmy years  yeah but  all right  if it works out that way  either way  i'm totally  we got it  it's gonna be great  tell us one story jimmy  not to put you on the spot  one story from the old days  please  uh  something that just stands out  after the 50 gallon  drum challenge  um  one of the girls  who was from cleveland  was still dirty  and i took her  into the men's room  and i fucked her  over a toilet  while she still smelled 
[02:00:30]  like the 50 gallon  drum  she took  she took a 20 hour bus ride  from cleveland  and i was  i was fortunate  that alone  i was fortunate enough  to be  this is another story  i've told a lot  but who cares  i love  i love the go to story  and uh  i accompanied jimmy  in his car  as he's dropping her  back off  at the poor authority  so she was officially  in new york  after a 20 hour bus ride  for maybe 5 hours  i fucked her up  with the toilet  and then she sucked 
[02:01:00]  my dick in the car  in front of opie  i told her to suck  my dick  and she did  while opie  was in the backseat  i did take a peek  yeah it's the only reason  i did it  cause jimmy begged me to  sure  yeah  i already shot my load  i was just trying to be  a good guy  he moves the rearview mirror  and i just giggled  like an idiot  yeah  she pulled in for a few minutes  see these are the stories  and then we dropped her  off at the poor authority  went and got a bite to eat  she sat in that fucking seat  getting all  frauded up  did you go down on her at all  no  why didn't even fucking  bump fist with her  when she left  she was a listener  yeah  that's true  okay  jimmy took a 
[02:01:30]  you took advantage  of the bathrooms  a few times  back in the day  i'm like where's jimmy  we're like  we'll be back  i'm still in touch  with the first girl  that sucked my dick  from being on the radio  friendly  really  and then one of those  bus tours we did  i remember being at the bar  with your  either your bag  or your penis out  that's when he came  in the water  in the ice  oh yeah  he jerked off in the ice  jerked off in the ice  that the keg was in  we had a keg  we had a keg  on a bus  that was driving us  around to do like  a couple of appearances 
[02:02:00]  around different towns  different towns  fucking keg  and we didn't have  the technology right  so the show was going  in and out  it was fucking horrendous  because i was back  at the studio  and i kept compared  at the speed  because you guys  would blow past  listeners that you  were supposed to  stop at  because we  they were trying  because we didn't  have a timed hour  they can't stop  i was telling the  listeners they can't  go under 50 miles  an hour  they'll explode  i'll tell you one  thing about that day  too  that brings  something i think  about a lot  we pulled in front 
[02:02:30]  of the uh  world trade centers  all right  and these guys  ran out of that  fucking building  to get wow stickers  there were a lot  of fans  that was a  that was a huge  stop for that  weird wow sticker  tour we did  and i always wonder  how many of those  guys  i always wonder  most of your  listeners run  the third or  fourth floor  that's true  exactly  and they hide  people  nobody at  fucking merrill lynch  came down 90  stories to get  wow stickers  they're the mop  yes  slinging the mops  all right  i'll be able to  sleep a little  better tonight  thank you  that's why 
[02:03:00]  we need you  you are fine  but jimmy  fucking shot  his load  into the ice  that was the  keg was in  yeah the girl  was blowing me  in the uh  she actually  was blowing me  on the bus  and then the ice  was melting  so it turned  into water  and then it's  just jimmy's  load floating  on the water  yeah it was  terrible  yeah the stories  really change  the jimmy  yeah yeah  that's that'll  be when it  goes to color  you know i mean  we'll start it  in black and white  right yeah  like the wizard  of oz  there's the  there's the story 
[02:03:30]  of jimmy eating  the ice cube  that's one of my  favorites  out of a girl's  ass  montana gun  montana gun  that was montana  gun  ice cubes up her  ass and jimmy  ate them  yeah i have  photos of that  i was pretty  impressed that day  that's good  i thought we had  a keeper  we just did the  unmasked  yeah i know  this was my goal  we just did an hour  well now cut this  shit up don wicklin  and we don't have to  show up  do it that way  we'll go over the  carolines and we'll  just hit play  enjoy everybody  and then we'll just  nod  set up some cardboard  cutouts  see what we did 
[02:04:00]  we just fucked  on wicklin's little  bit  he's very excited  about this  he wants it to go  well  way more than we  are  well you know how  he likes an  appearance though  he loves a good  appearance  and it's going to  be a nice itinerary  and everything's going  to happen at exact  times  i was told we're  not allowed to go  one minute over  why  because then the  signing and the  meeting and the  greeting and the  picture day caroline  so then we don't 
[02:04:30]  have the right place  i think  i'm not even joking  i know  we need some time  to hang a little  bit so maybe we  could try to find a  place a little bigger  that gives us a little  room to work  being forced out after  an hour and a half  or whatever is kind  of because if this  thing is work an hour  is going to be right  it's going to go fast  so if it's working and  we decide maybe we  could do another 15 20  minutes we should be  able to do that right  i completely agree i  think we leave and  want more we just did  an hour  but you know i mean  at the signing you  may want to hang  who knows i mean  because people are  going to come out 
[02:05:00]  just for an hour and  then just leave and  there should be some  kind of a celebration  or something  i know it's hard to  work at this but i  think we can maybe uh  you know make it even  better we should  really think about  it yeah and carolines  would understand if we  move it the carolines  is great but they  have i guess they  have a show booked  and they would  understand maybe we  go a little bigger  and have a little  space that's something  you've got to talk  about i know the  paramount and  huntington would have  us in a second but  that's a big room  that's about maybe  two thousand oh boy  that'd be fantastic  though those are the  fridges from that's 
[02:05:30]  a big room from any  dough now we're looking  at the refrigerators  the big bucket  yeah see one start as  our lousy little  food fridge  yeah and that's the  jagermeister machine you  said that oh man the  jagermeister machine  that's on top of the  third fridge  nothing better than  going back after work  still in the office and  hearing the jagermeister  go  just pumping out  icy cold jagermeister  and the sobe people  got us a fridge and  then the snapple people  got pissed so they gave  us a fridge  and then we just  filled it with beer 
[02:06:00]  yeah so that's not  even that's early on  because i think we  ended up with four  refrigerators  i gotta tell you we  did have fun in that  office but the amount  of wayward girls  ronnie fit in his  office  was astounding  astounding  this isn't an unmasked  to me  this is your time  i know  this is your time  i'm just  and i don't have any  problem talking about  all the abortions  because you're not  having it  it's not going to  fucking happen  maybe someday  maybe  not now  all right  look i would go 
[02:06:30]  into ken's office  because he was never  there and just read  his shit  sit there  that's that's not a  that's not  that's not a set of  photo i would just  go in there and read  his shit  that's nothing compared  to a girl having  ass sex on his couch  in his office  yeah that one hurt  his feelings  that one really did  hurt his feelings  he hated anal that  man  couldn't stand it  he hated anal  look at the vodka  how long do you  think it goes by  before you really  start to feel  nostalgic  for a time  you know what i mean  like  this stuff really does  look like another  era  it's yeah 
[02:07:00]  yeah  i'm feeling nostalgic  right now  you can tell by the  crt monitors  right  sergeant harpen doll  a long time ago  yes  was it anstice  i had barbie dolls  fucking on my monitor  the saddest day  was because that office  really was like a  clubhouse  like a  before the man cave  but we didn't have to  call it a man cave  it was just our place  and when we came  they let us come back  one time after we got  fired to get some  of our like  personal belongings  stuff that  actually we cared  about  that room 
[02:07:30]  was destroyed  remember there  were just piles  all over the place  they were just  trying to find  something to fuck  us over  and they never  found it  make that picture  bigger sal  i want to see  what's on the  computer monitor  oh yeah  is there anything  interesting or the  icons all boring  i think they're  all video games  and i don't think  i did one thing  of show prep on  that i would just  play video games  look half-life's  on there  everquest  bumper sticker  sims  del monitor  yeah i look  i got a joystick  i was doing  flight simulator 
[02:08:00]  you got two  barbie dolls  eating each other  out  and one's  blowing  down  i didn't see  that one over  there  it was so childish  and that's childish  and then to the  right  oh this is kind  of cool actually  another story i  forgot about  the wow plane  oh yeah  yeah  yeah that guy  crashed it  no here's the  weird thing  no what  remember the  other  hold on  hold on  the the banner  at one of our  live gigs  uh they  some banner  company was  gonna come by  with opie and  anthony whip him  out wednesday 
[02:08:30]  or whatever  and we're like  whatever happened  it never came  by and we  learned like a  day later it  was in the  local paper that  it crashed into  a tree  everyone was all  right but the  plane i think the  plane crashed right  i think it was  it was a bad  landing in our  and our if  someone could find  that you have  that photo  uh yeah  still missing  because you see  the banner all  mangled in the  tree and you can  make out like  oh the letter  o the letter p  and like an a  over here and  yeah whatever  here's the thing  now do you even  go into your  office no you  don't mean i 
[02:09:00]  don't have an  same way i am  here let me  officially gave up  our office years  ago that's it  there's a there's  a ron and fez  office on the  37th floor i don't  think i've ever  been there no  really don't go to  the 37th floor  right there's no  mike something  right right i  like this being our  office too because  if anyone wants to  meet in our  office which is the  studio  there's always a  show coming up  right so it's as  long as the  commercial breaks  are right that's  how long you got  then we're hitting  the elevators  wow look at all  that shit whose  desk is that 
[02:09:30]  i don't even know  that's a that's like  uh one of the  producers i guess  because our  desks were like  right next to each  other we stared at  each other  none of your  producers are still  with you right from  oh god no  most of our staff's  different right  anybody from the  old staff here or  no no no we  got no we got a  really good staff  though so yeah  people who end up  hating us what are  you gonna do i thank  them for everything  they did for us  whatever  you gotta make your 
[02:10:00]  own career though  can't depend on us  really we prove that  whatever we'll drag you  right down with us  absolutely  holy shit  i found the ice cube  photos  oh you found them  where are they  i i remember that  moment  oh here's montana  gun  oh bruce campbell  was in that day  oh wow  look how thin i was  what  i'm probably  you got to insert  the ice cube  shoving it in  yeah but then it  just kind of  accidentally popped  out of her asshole  and i just threw it 
[02:10:30]  in my mouth  i didn't even think  about it  that was when i  first started coming  on the show  can you imagine  what was on  wow  oh man  that's 622 of 2001  that's uh june of  she is  shoving an ice cube  right up her ass  that's  that has to be the  the shot of jimmy  with the ice cube  yeah  the fucked up thing  also  the fucked up thing  also  we would describe  this shit  to where no one  had any doubt  what was going on  and it was completely  legit  and within  you know  some boundary 
[02:11:00]  that we  we knew  we couldn't cross  by just being blatant  with it  could you imagine  there's bruce campbell  is that my brother  brother joe yeah  brother joe's there  bruce campbell's  hugging  yeah  naked montana gone  all these pictures  are linked on  oh and a show  on twitter right now  so  this is crazy shit  remember that couch  oh god  that couch  a lesbian couch  wow  you guys both were  in relationships  so there was  like a lot of things  i would do on the couch  that you guys couldn't do  so you would like  how you want to get  i loved it 
[02:11:30]  what a waste  you were the go to  oh it was great  getting lap dances  insane  this is fucking  wolf from wall street  shit  it really is  yes  there's pussy eating  going on  it's porno  going on right there  two girls 69  69ing on the couch  and look we're shoving  mics getting every sound  and not with panties on  get the fucking slurping  and not with panties on  not like kissing  each other's bellies  or anything  they are 69ing  face deep  in each other's pussy  yeah it's like the thing  from alien is on her face  yes  ass eating right there 
[02:12:00]  wow  this is great  look even at the size  of that mic  the fucking mic  was just gigantic  what the fuck  it's like edward r murrow  amazing  we stopped talking  because the girls  again looking at a big  puffy vag  crazy  and a happy boy  in between these two girls  the nudity  and sexual  debauchery  that went on  jimmy's manning  jimmy's there  yeah  he's a manning  in the middle of that  jimmy's in there  what are you cutting on your head  panties  panties on my head  I would hold panties 
[02:12:30]  amazing  you loved us  oh I did man  are you kidding me  you loved us  when it was showing off there  I was going to throw myself  out my 22nd floor window  I've never been more depressed  remember it would just smell  like ass and pussy  and fucking sex  before I got there  I would always have  my dumb watch on  give me the watch  that's what would happen  people would come into that place  and go  what is that smell  and we wouldn't know  because we were so used to it  and yeah  what smell  it was mixed with so many 
[02:13:00]  freaking smells  a lot of different smells  a lot of smells  some tears  some tears  some tears  and then we had the window  that overlooked the showers  all right  you saw the naked girls  across the way right  yeah they were amazing  wasn't good enough  we had naked girls in studio  then we  right around  happy hour time  so around 530  these women would run home  to get showers  before they went out  for the night  especially Friday nights  were really good  Thursday and Friday nights  and a whole line of windows  and there were 
[02:13:30]  there were a bunch  there wasn't just one  amazing  there was at least  three or four  on a regular basis  that we'd watch  just shower  that place was so  fucking insane  so fun  that's just crazy  where Fridays  where drinking shows  crazy  for the listeners  could come in  right  pack in  oh the empties  oh my god  what's his name  a mail  mailroom guy  would take out  our empties  he'd take out  the empties  yeah what's his name  I forgot his name  it wasn't Pete  no  superstar right 
[02:14:00]  yes  Eddie  star Eddie  yeah  Eddie  I took him to the  Brooklyn Diner once  to try to be a good guy  and he just kept staring  at the waitress's  tits  oh yeah  he loved girls  it takes a lot for me  to get uncomfortable  I was so uncomfortable  he would not stop  he loved girls  yeah I got called in once  because he got a lap dance  and then he wouldn't let go  of the fucking girl  and he kept fucking stalking her  oh boy  and they said this is one  to fart him  like he's just having fun  they're like no  he has superhuman strength  you don't fucking understand  right right right 
[02:14:30]  that was the nice way  of saying  that type of strength  right  sure  superhuman  you used to talk about  his mailroom skills  remember  oh yeah  he could  oh boy  oh boy  I don't know  we used to have to go  to the mail slots  because at that point  we used to get paid  with a check  it didn't go into  an account  oh I forgot about that  and you used to have  cubby holes  with your name on it  and you'd have to go  through everyone's  to find your check  he would just throw  he couldn't read  but they couldn't fire him  obviously  and he would throw  a check  so we're like 
[02:15:00]  oh look  mine's in fucking  Dave Herman's  or whatever  your hard drive  I heard from him  not too long ago  he's living in Florida  he's doing great  he actually got a  he retired from there  so he gets a check  and then he's working  at a supermarket  or something  I don't know  I think he meant Dave  no no  he's not doing well  his own problems  yeah  I don't know  I think he'll beat it  yeah I hope so  you know Woody Allen did  maybe he will 
[02:15:30]  maybe  oh  he didn't write  Blue Jasmine though  so  he's going to have  a tougher time  right  anyway  so that'll be fun  it's going to be a blast  we're just scratching  the surface  because as you start  talking  you start remembering  a lot of stuff too  you certainly do  it does make you feel  crazy that there's not  a book  it really should be  a movie  we should get a  fucking movie producer  tell all these stories  and just say  go ahead  do whatever you want  with it  it might be book time  I remember when I was  making out with Melinda  down in the garage 
[02:16:00]  and Scott  remember Scott Herman  sure  our first GM  for the station  I mean for that station  right  N-E-W  and he's  he like  I think he went to you  and said something like  you know  you might want to tell  Anthony to cool it  because people will see  and I'm like  I don't give a shit  people see  no no  no honestly  he did come to me  and he was trying  to be a good guy  yeah yeah  no  it was cool  but  what about you  getting busted  yeah he's like  yeah yeah  if he's trying to  you know 
[02:16:30]  keep this on the QT  he's doing a horrible job  I don't care  making out  making out  ah there you go  it's already on the front page  of the post  yeah yeah  I wouldn't worry about it  boy that was great  when the post was writing  about my testimony  I remember you were  I remember how open you are  you're so open now  but I remember back then  you didn't  like you would  like you didn't want to  talk about that stuff publicly  or we couldn't reference it  on the show  but you know  there was some money on the line  yeah there was money on the line 
[02:17:00]  money money  you know what are they going to do now  go to fucking Dominic Barber  for all the transcripts  no but any of it  I mean like  you know  I was  yeah  Don Wicklund just texted  oh  we'll have details Monday  on how to get tickets  to the Unmasked  with Ron Bennington  April 17th  at Caroline's  that's right  and I don't know  Don  I hope you're listening  I think we could even  make this even better  wow  not to not Caroline's  it's simply the time out  is the only issue  it's the time you have to be out  by like  do your hour  and get out  yeah  because I think  if it's working 
[02:17:30]  we might as well  like doing  like an hour and a half  keep going  yeah  if it's working  we'll know  we certainly will  kind of like this bit  we know we've run  it's run its course  and we're going to go  we're going to go to break now  that's how this works  and we'll just milk  something else  for an hour or so  if everyone wants to travel  I could easily get us  in the Paramount  in Huntington  yeah  it's a big room  it's a big room  oh yeah  it's a big room  yeah it is  but it could be fun though  Huntington  Long Island crowd  oh shit  that's where we met  take the Rileys 
[02:18:00]  after the fact  oh yeah  do a little party  yeah we could do  a little something  yeah  I'll throw  you know  some chicken spring rolls  for everybody  maybe some people  put one of those bracelets  on me  you know what I mean  a bracelet  that's my night  maybe some people  from school  that I went to school  on Long Island  that would be great  my dean  my dean can show up  and go  we were wrong  Anthony  and you  you were right  absolutely  now I pronounce you  you've had a less  successful career  than Rupert  we could do like 
[02:18:30]  a this is your life  and I'll just keep  bringing up people  that would be great  I was your PD  in Boston  who are you  Don  he's the enemy  Jerry  you're on the air  that was the list  we want to go  to a bigger venue  I hear  what do you think  let me think about it  think about it 
[02:19:00]  if you want us  to show up  it's got to be  a bigger  oh shit  do you negotiate  besides another venue  oh you got other ideas  yep  really  how's that gonna work  like the old fights  movie theaters  closed circuit  closed circuit  remember those  you'd go to like  the Nassau Coliseum  to watch  Frasier Alley  or something  and boy  the fucking  TVs weren't  very good 
[02:19:30]  back then  what are you doing  Don  I'm just listening  to you  yeah no  I'm starting to think  that maybe  we need a little  more room  room as far as  maybe a slightly  bigger place  I'm not getting  cocky about this  slightly bigger  and then also  you know  room to work  if it's working out  we could go  a little longer  all good ideas  let me think about it  we'll see if we can  put together a new  plan for you  or we could tour  with this thing  do an hour in each

[02:48:00]  why is he rocked running  what's  Eric what's going on at our office  is there a fire  why  why were you running  because I think it's audio  oh  oh what is it  it's 18 minutes of audio  what  what's this  it's crazy  the thing with me  yeah in DC  it's crazy  18 minutes  I'm so long  oh  give it a minute  what track can we go to  track 4  4  just want to hear me lose my shit  Ron loses it  is that the only track we're playing 
[02:48:30]  he doesn't know  you're going to make him run again  he has best of CDs of you guys  who  Ron and Fez 2005  why would he have a best of CD  right  I don't know  that's every show  when did you join  XM  2006 I guess  no  yeah  what month  I don't know  late summer  maybe  so we were there  two years without you guys  yeah  remember the golden ticket talk  yeah the golden ticket 
[02:49:00]  we were the only golden ticket  there's supposed to be  a bunch  hey we  you know  we had some ideas  they just didn't want to  fucking pay up  that golden ticket thing  was supposed to be a real thing  we were going to bring some shows on  yeah  you already know the shows  that you wanted  what did we want  I'm trying to remember now  yeah there were a few  I don't remember exactly  so we won  Scott and Todd  Scott and Todd  I was one of them  sure  Scott or Todd  yeah Scott or Todd  now  that's what you guess  it's just track 4  so Ron was doing  his show 
[02:49:30]  not even a bit  he was just doing a show  and the PD didn't like  the direction of the show  I guess  because Fezzy I think  was upset  so you decided  let's do some wrestling  this was the beginning  of Fez's mental illness  days  it was like the very  that's how long  it goes back  so he had kind of  broken down a little bit  when we were in DC  and I used to think  well he's going to  bounce back  he's going to feel better  oh boy  I was naive  yeah  I'm not going to lie  there were no signs  before 2005  huh  well a lot of it 
[02:50:00]  had to go  no it was  it was as soon as  we left  New York  and went to DC  took it very hard  see what happened is  we had a producer  on our show  that we didn't  take with us  and I didn't know  it at the time  because Fez was  straight then  right  and he was really  devastated by that  attached to him  a little bit  yeah  who's the producer  I'm trying to remember  your old guys  not uh 
[02:50:30]  Al  no not Al Dukes  okay  um  I think Al Blueface  who do you think  farted  I didn't fart  you're excited  about Unmasked  oh my god  extremely  what are you  pushing out today  nothing  I'm just  looking forward  to Black Sabbath  on Monday  it smells like  fucking Marcus Hook  in the goddamn  wow it's awful  late fucking June 
[02:51:00]  let's hear the audio  I want to hear this  while we're doing  the set up  oh  here was the set up  so anyway  that's what  so Fez started  a little breakdown  he was very upset  yeah really that one  like one  he thought he was  having a heart attack  right  and we went to break  and it was just  a panic attack  but it was like  massive  and then  uh  you know  this  then he'd started  crying on the air  and stuff like that  and it was really  which makes great radio  it does  he hasn't done it  in a while  but it makes great radio  so a PD 
[02:51:30]  not understanding that  is bullshit  so then Ron decides  we'll make him happy  we'll talk wrestling  for an hour  and then that's the  that's where the PD  had the problem  decided to try to step  into you know  Ron's house  and uh  well the shit  hit the fan  what's up  all good  what's happening  what is this  real audio  real audio  remember real audio  it's gonna be the new format  what the fuck Eric  exactly  we just did a 10 minute setup  and the audio was like 
[02:52:00]  horrendous  would you drop your lunch on it  huh  like images  I'm gonna show  I'm gonna show you  who the guy was  did you get it off the skimmer  as he was crushing on it  yeah this  sounds like it's off  the cassette skimmer  oh not  this guy  yeah  oh right  I remember him  yeah he was an island guy  oh I remember him  Fez you had a little something for him  yeah we didn't know it  at the time  was the guy  no very straight  Fez is only crushed on straight guys  right  so 
[02:52:30]  Troy Kwan  going down there  no that wasn't it  that wasn't it  E-Rock  E-Rock it's the worst audio  I've ever heard in my life  I don't even know  if you could play this  let's give it a shot  I'm trying to think of  who from your show was  somebody he crushed on  on your show  oh um  I'll text and ask  what's up dude  all good  think  what's happening  so the PD came in  no  no  this whole thing  is a little blind  out of proportion  I just found out  a guy called  like hotlined us 
[02:53:00]  and I hadn't been  hotlined in years  ah yeah  who has it  this camera  what's he want  you want to know  if Fez was on the show  tonight  hey we wanted to know  if we have an effing  program director  cause we've never seen you  this entire year  what an ass  so as far as we're concerned  we've never had a program director here  so why don't you check on that  because when I talked to New York  and I brought your name up  they said he's just the secretary  Johnny Tube Sticks  the program director  we have here  is the guy who watches the paint dry 
[02:53:30]  uh  handsome Johnny Tube Sticks  like you know radio  like you've ever worked in radio  other than watching  G Gordon Liddy read a paper  for three hours a day  Jesus  you wonder why  so Fez  what do you want to talk about  I guess you've been dogging it tonight  you're laid back  I guess so  I apologize then  sorry about that  why didn't you call him  when his grandmother died  and he's flying back and forth  doing shows here 
[02:54:00]  he doesn't get a call then  he never got a call  to say thank you from him  that was from no one  maybe there's some more O'Reilly emails  that have to be answered  unbelievable  unbelievable  turn your radio off  just turn it off  you're not the program director here  you've never been one  that's bad  and stop calling Brian  at 9 o'clock in the morning  he works nights  and every morning  he goes  is that Don on the phone  you're having your 
[02:54:30]  Casey Kasem moment  I thought this was AM radio  and there was static  you're going through a tunnel  and every morning  he goes  guess what time  I got a call today  the guy works nights  he doesn't get all  out of here  until 12 o'clock  he's up for a couple hours  call him after noon  we've got nothing to say  other than  do the AOL point  band gets shirts  make a fucking maniac out of me  sound like Paul Anka  just like when I said  have someone train Brian 
[02:55:00]  no one did  why  because no one here  knows how to do it  you don't know how to do it  oh boy  or do you want more out of Fez  you want him to sit around  and talk about  how difficult it's been for him  the last month or so  no forget that  how difficult it's been for him  the last two years  but he keeps giving to this place  how difficult it's been for him  for two effing years  call him there  and ask him there  or apologize to this man  but don't ever call here 
[02:55:30]  and ask if he's dogging it  because nobody gives more than Fez Watley  anywhere I've ever worked  nobody gives more than Fez Watley  call you again  and I'll rip that damn phone out of the wall  I'm not playing games with you  I'm not effing playing games  I'll chase you down the damn street with it  don't make me sit here  and tell what we really want to do  Cameron  because my agent tells me  to stay cool  until he gets here 
[02:56:00]  that's all you've got going for you right now  because if you want to see  Mr. fucking White  I'll do it tonight bitch  I'll do it tonight  and I'll say exactly  what takes place in these effing halls  wow  Mr. Pink  stay tight until Joe gets here  stop pointing at accusing finger at Fez  if I could do Chris Penn  was it awkward when you saw him  for the first time after that  no  I'm willing to let bygones be bygones  when I offend somebody 
[02:56:30]  you know what I mean  you're really good  you can motherfuck someone  and then just let it go  it's the same way  like if I owe you money  I'm ready to put it out of my mind  fuck it  wow you're good  that was then this is now  you sound like a million bucks in that clip  let's start fresh  that's what I say  let's start fresh  so I found out who  that from your staff  Fez was in love with  it was Derek  Derek  remember Derek  Fez liked Derek?  yeah  wow he likes those fucking 
[02:57:00]  Tim from the office guy  he does  yeah  he likes  the non-threatening  heterosexual male  that's what he's like  he wanted to kiss Derek's neck  I don't know  raging alcoholic  he likes that  Derek was a lot of fun  oh I know he was  he likes the guy  that can drink a case  yeah  don't make you a bad person  you can't judge  no  you can't judge  right  people saying you joined in 2005  I don't know  I felt like it was only a year 
[02:57:30]  but whatever  hmm  the end of 2005  well yeah  the fall of 2005  yeah  it's crazy  it's crazy  so I'll go fast  how long were you guys up the other time  that time  two years  three months  wow  26 months  we should be saving this for the unmasked  yeah  true  whole fucking world changed  it's gonna be no stories  did it ever  the whole unmasked  it's gonna be old  where'd you get that blue sweatshirt  well you know  I was at Marshall's  and I liked it  right  is this gonna cause a problem today 
[02:58:00]  what's that  changing things around  no  what we just  kind of talked about  nah  Fez is bouncing back  I'm starting to feel it  alright  it's gonna happen any day now  uh huh  nice  how come nobody invited Fez on the show  I love having Ron  but why isn't Fez invited as well  I would love that  he's busy  and we don't want to like  you know  impose  he and Ope have a weird thing  no  maybe one day when Ope takes off  it's a weird tension to have  yeah  I'd have Fez in here  I miss doing Ron's show 
[02:58:30]  what do you think of the Colbert  you guys should come over and do that too  we will  soon  uh  what do you guys think of the Colbert thing  oh he should be fired  I don't go for that type of humor  yeah  he pushed it  that's right  ban him  it's a brave tweak  even though he does uh  a character  no  he says uh  that he doesn't run  the Colbert Report  Twitter  someone else does  oh okay  they probably take quotes  from the show  uh huh  I think that's  that's exactly right  uh 
[02:59:00]  you know  there's a million followers  most of them bots  and then they have an intern  just tweet out  uh huh  things  and he tweeted out  what did he say exactly  it was uh  get to it Sal  quickly  well the  mediate  mediate  I like these guys  I do  except folks  hand soccer  or as Americans call it  football  both the PC police  continue to hammer  the Washington Redskins  over their so called  offensive name  though if you've seen 
[02:59:30]  them play recently  their name is the least  offensive thing on the field  thankfully Redskins owner  Daniel Snyder  has found a way  to smoke them  the peace pipe  the Washington Redskins  are trying to improve  their image  with the Native American  community  owner Dan Snyder  is now creating  a foundation  to assist  American Indian tribes  Snyder sent a letter  to Redskins fans  laying a plan  to start the  Washington Redskins  original Americans  foundation  that's right  the Washington Redskins  original Americans  foundation 
[03:00:00]  because Redskins  is not offensive  if you only use it  once in your name  and folks  the healing  has already begun  the charity  has distributed  over 3,000  cold weather  coats to several tribes  and you can see  how happy they are  in their new gear  the foundation  also assisted  in the purchase  of a new backhoe  for the Omaha tribe  that's right  assisted  because you can't  expect a team  worth 1.7 billion  dollars  to pay for the 
[03:00:30]  entire backhoe  those things  cost thousands  to cover that price  they'd have to sell  a beer  and a soft pretzel  folks  this move  by Dan Snyder  inspires me  because my show  has frequently  come under attack  for having a  so-called  offensive mascot  my beloved character  Ching Chong Ding Dong  I love tea  it's so good for you  you're so pretty  American girl  you come here 
[03:01:00]  you kiss my tea  make all sweet  I don't need no sugar  when you're around  come on my rickshaw  I give you a right  to Bangkok  now folks  the small minded  out there  have called  Ching Chong Ding Dong  an offensive caricature  of an Asian American  that is wrong  Mr. Ding Dong  is not American  he is a Chinaman  from Guangdong  and if he ever heard  someone call him  a stereotype  he would choke  on his opium pipe 
[03:01:30]  of course  there was no  pleasing  the attack dogs  over at Asian Media Watch  who demanded  that I remove  Ching Chong  from the show's letterhead  and stop having him  accept awards  on my behalf  the point is  the point is  offensive or not  not  Ching Chong  is part of  the unique heritage  of the Colbert Nation  that cannot change  but I am willing  to show the Asian community  that I care  by introducing  the Ching Chong Ding Dong 
[03:02:00]  Foundation for Sensitivity  to Orientals  or whatever  to be a wonderful charity  thank you  I will applaud  my sensitivity  as well  it's a wonderful charity  it's already provided  3,000 of those triangle hats  he's making a brilliant  social point  yes exactly  and these dummies  are offended  just take it at face value  instead of looking  at the context  it's such a sarcastic  obvious smash 
[03:02:30]  at the Redskins  of course  what dumb Americans  it's like  it has like 15 seconds left  and then we'll explain  what's going on  I will applaud  my sensitivity  as well  it's a wonderful charity  that's already provided  3,000 of those  triangle hats  to Asian Americans  in need  I assume  there's a need  because I've never seen  wearing those things  anymore  and I owe  all this sensitivity  to Redskins owner  Dan Snyder  so Asians 
[03:03:00]  send your thank you  letters to him  not me  we'll be right back  brilliant  absolutely brilliant  you crushed it  who's got the problem  and what's the problem  so then the tweet was  I'm willing to show  Asian community  no that's the tweet  right  what he said  about Ching Chung  ding dong  right  but that's just a quote  from the bit  right  and now they want to fire  he's completely  in zero trouble  cancel Colbert  I think  he's in zero trouble  is the hashtag 
[03:03:30]  hashtag  cancel Colbert  come on  so  see if it's trending  it's trending  oh boy  and of course  it'll be a lot of people  that never even  saw the piece  no no no  they'll just read it  take it at face value  right  not in the context  of satire  Sui Park is upset  why  Sui Park  what does Sui Park say  because white liberals  are just as complicit  in making Asian Americans  into punchlines  and we aren't amused 
[03:04:00]  however it wasn't  making them  into punchline  he was taking  what is an obviously  offensive thing  and saying  and showing how ridiculous  it would be  to not view it  as offensive  see the Redskins  is an offensive name  and it's being  spun a different way  by Dan Snyder  so he used Asians  as a group  that would obviously  be offended by this  he was making the point  that this would be  very offensive  so if you don't get that  you're a dumb motherfucker  you're simply a dummy  and the only way 
[03:04:30]  to deal with this  is to come out  and go  you're dummies  I didn't get it  you mean all Asians  are dummies  any Asian offended  by this  or any non-Asian  offended by this  is a fucking  dummy  so yes  any Asian offended  by this  is a fucking dummy  bravo  or non-Asian  except for the Jews  they're fine  right  except for the Jews  they're fine  maybe if he would  just apologize  yeah he should apologize  he's growing his belly  a little bit  I didn't know  I had no idea 
[03:05:00]  I'm so thankful  you brought this  to my attention  right  it's a pretty brave  thank you  it's a brave bit though  it is  good for him  in this day and age  that's pretty brave  well you expect people  to get it  and they just don't  but the fact that we live  in a country where  that's considered a brave bit  even though it's very funny  shows you how emasculated  humor has become  like Lenny Bruce  was on stage  fucking doing bits  on the word nigger  and on all these  true social issues  yeah  and this is considered  a brave bit  it's like he's just  he's speaking  do you know what I mean  like just honestly 
[03:05:30]  about race  50 years after the fact  like 50 years after Lenny  that's a great bit  yeah  but this is still  considered like wow  and what's sad  radio guys doing  the same bit  fired immediately  oh yeah  the bosses don't  want to hear  that you were trying  to make a you know  some social commentary  same company by the way  huh  working for the same company  oh yeah of course  you know  yeah exactly  Jesus  thank you Jimmy  so that's what I mean  a lot of those  voters over there  I know right  that's what I mean  putting it down  hydrate  yeah  that's what I mean 
[03:06:00]  by being a brave bit  though  a lot of guys  getting in trouble  for that shit now  have you been checked  for diabetes  I'm just looking into  them you're going  through the water  I know  yeah yeah  trying to stay hydrated  yeah  yeah  ching chong  ding dong  ching chong ding dong  offended some people  there's no cake horn  yeah  cheers  cheers to cake horn  cake horn took off  yeah  yeah  congrats on that  because of a very  slight mistake  someone made  just a slight mistake 
[03:06:30]  it's amazing  shouldn't have went  anywhere  well you know  does he understand  how amazing that is  for the show  no  no  that he tripped on that  no  and then it's like  oh god  we're not going to  let that go  no  you can't let that go  who do you think  are the only people  left that don't get  offended by anything  I think rednecks  are pretty  pretty fucking good  pretty hands off  for them it's religion  even if they're not  necessarily  they're the ones  who will come in  on religion  I'd say most people  are not offended  but everyone has learned  that that's the attention  getting thing 
[03:07:00]  to shout into a bullhorn  so I'd say  there's no one left  who doesn't feign  I'll go  I'll go with the deaf  nah  the deaf  you start doing like  sign language  funny jokes  not many of us  know the sign language  they didn't enjoy  the fucking interpreter  from Nelson Mandela's  feeling  that was amazing  holy shit  how did that guy  get through all that  he was doing  security  curly Howard stuff  no one's able to  stop a black guy  in Africa  that was the thing  that's true 
[03:07:30]  they were like  oh he belongs here  what was some of the  stuff that he was saying  whoop whoop whoop  didn't make any sense  no it didn't make any sense  none right  like when a comic  does the fucking  hand gestures  it was the same thing  it was all fake  oh god  so there's no  the Irish don't get mad  right  the Irish are pretty good  the Irish are good  they take care of themselves  they don't like the gays  in the parade  but that's not an offensive  thing  I think the Irish are  up there  they're pretty good  I mean you can call them  drunk  Italians don't really 
[03:08:00]  they can handle it  yeah that's true  well  no  some Italians get offended  by mob movies  oh yeah  they hated the soprano  that's a newer thing  that's a newer thing  though  it's what it is  and that's a small  percentage  I call them  Uncle Tony's  that's my thing  Uncle Tony's  it's weird  people get offended  more than I think  they ever have before  I remember being younger  and they would actually  sell Polak jokes  in books 
[03:08:30]  where you could go  and  Blanche Knott  her name was  yeah  Blanche Knott  Blanche K-N-O-T  look her up  I think she put out  a lot of those  Polak jokes  and because that was so hot  then they tried other  they had an Italian one too  oh yeah  truly tasteless jokes  oh you're right  yeah  I think I got this book  still at home  yeah it was  that was good for the can  right  we all love it  I think there were volumes  volumes and volumes  jokes for the John  you got some 
[03:09:00]  some jokes  from the book there  so  a couple jokes  anything with  Ching Shung  the Ding Dong  that's a great  what was Blanche's  problem with the  the Polaks  it was just  considered a joke  to do at the time  right  and then I remember  I went up to Canada  and all the Polish jokes  were about  Newfies  Newfies  and I was like  what are you talking about  a Newfie didn't do that  a Polish person did  right  they got lazy  a little white out  and just  put Newfie in his place  everybody just has a thing  everyone's going to 
[03:09:30]  bust balls  no matter where you go  he used to just say  Polak  yeah  it wasn't like  you never said  the Polish person  no  oh yeah  yeah I think he's a Polak  I read a few of these  Archie Bunker said  let's get self-fired today  read a few of the Polish jokes  please  why should we help his career  did you hear about  the Polish government  brought a thousand  septic tanks  as soon as they learned  to drive them  they're going to  invade Russia  this is  topical  they're so stupid  they get a septic tank  thinking they can  fucking  you know what I mean 
[03:10:00]  invade Russia  it's going to be like  a regular tank  right  yeah they don't realize  that that's just a term  right  yeah they don't get that  that's the opener  for the book  yeah  that's the opener  because look  it has the big D  this is 1979 funny  that's the opener  that's the opener  alright  keep going  did you hear about  the new Polish drink  Perrier and Club Soda  it's the same  fucking thing  they're just mixing  exactly  why would Polish people  have no taste buds  you can make  you could stretch it though  why does the pole  always take a dime  along on his dates  so that if he can't

[03:17:30]  from my house  and they see a stack  of laptops  on my ottoman  in my living room  and they're like  oh yeah  working off a five year old  fucking computer  it's not going to get  better than that  we'll see you guys  Monday  the Opie and Anthony  show has gone to a close  stay tuned  to reflect  relive  and get the story  behind the story  of the finest moments  of today's show  and I believe  that Sam 
[03:18:00]  has gotten  even sicker  after he heard  the  if he did hear  the pre-show  it's Dennis Falcone  in one more time  taking care of  the Friday business  as we head into  the weekend  here on the  Opie and Anthony  after show  the wrap up show  and I guess  hopefully you were  listening this morning  they told me that  we're going to have  a special guest today  don't let on  who the special guest is  and I said okay  and it was none other  than Ronnie B  they told me was coming  and I said wow 
[03:18:30]  Ron Bennington  on a Friday morning  getting up this early  I mean he's going to  do his own show  noon to 3  on Sirius XM  Comedy Hits 99  Ron and Fez  but he's coming in  early on a Friday  morning  what is going on  and we found out  about it  I was psyched  when we found out  that Ron is retiring  and moving to Florida  and he's just going to  work on a golf course  as a caddy  for the rest of his life  because that's what  he feels he wants to do  that's what his calling is  it was a religious calling 
[03:19:00]  that he had  and no of course not  that's just a  a poke at it  he worked the other day  doing a great job  on the George Lopez  special that I believe  we're repeating  on some of the comedy  channels here  at Sirius XM  we had the listeners  in and the fishbowl  and he did such a great job  I was so in awe  of watching him work  with George Lopez  putting the crowd  at ease  and having a great time  and we're going to do  something we call  the Unmasked special  maybe you've heard  these on Sirius XM  and Ronnie is going 
[03:19:30]  to be hosting it  with none other than  our own Opie and Anthony  that is fantastic  isn't it  if you want to go  to my clip of the day  it is Ron's announcement  for the Unmasked  oh so your clip  is doing that  ok so let's go  to Ron's clip  Ron talking about this  Eric's clip  E-Rock's clip  when it was exposed  here on the  Opie and Anthony  show this morning  but are you guys  at least a little  sentimental  about the 20 years  yeah I guess  I don't know  it's weird  how much has changed  in 20 years 
[03:20:00]  I look back fondly  yeah  on 20 years  sure  you know  made history  Ronnie  is that right  made history  well the  well the thought here  was to get everybody  together for the 20 years  and for the first time  you guys get together  and seriously talk  about it a little bit  in an Unmasked episode  there we go  there we go  the Unmasked  which I believe  gives you that  stamp of approval  it's kind of the  Hall of Fame 
[03:20:30]  it really is  for comedy  so you've run out  of people to talk to  is what you're saying  not at all  okay  not at all  we're still shooting  for Gervais  you know  that was a great one  because Ronnie again  stopped by this morning  to announce that  we're going to be having  a great Unmasked special  with Opie and Anthony  and I guess so far  it's on tap  definitely for April 17th  and it's going to be  at Caroline's  and although  they were hinting  at maybe having it  at another venue  well we don't know  about that  but for now  it's at Caroline's 
[03:21:00]  5pm April 17th  now I'm pretty tight  with the people  at the Knights of Columbus  Hall out in Hicksville  Long Island  and it's a big room  and you know  we could go there early  we could play cards  with a lot of the members  I think we'd have  a great time doing that  get a couple of  six foot heroes  and have a great time  at it  but we might want  to just step it up  a bit  if you want to call in  and talk about this  the phone number here  1-866-969-1969  that's 866-969-1969  and you know what  let's take caller
