<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of their upcoming CD signing in Boston, mentioning potential guest appearances by Carlos Mencia and possibly Regis Philbin.  The hosts engaged in offensive, stereotypical humor about Mencia's ethnicity, with Opie also revealing he was over-medicated.  A significant portion of the show was dedicated to the one-year anniversary of the "Voyeur Bus" incident, a stunt involving a bus of topless teenagers driving through New York City.  Numerous audio clips were played, featuring participants like Rick, Jim Norton, Psycho Mark, a surprised Nathan Lane, and a police officer. These clips detailed the excitement, the escalating police presence, the arrests of several individuals including Lewis Black, and the ensuing chaos, highlighting conflicting accounts of the police intervention and the sheer number of officers and media involved. FoundryMusic.com was cited as a source for video footage.  A CNN report on the incident was also played, featuring interviews with the women on the bus who identified themselves as Opie and Anthony show groupies, and mentioning a subsequent lawsuit against the city.

Carlos Mencia then joined the show in studio.  The ensuing conversation was rife with profanity, offensive jokes, racial and ethnic slurs targeting various groups, and discussions about the aftermath of 9/11. Mencia, referencing his Honduran background, made numerous jokes about ethnic stereotypes. He also discussed his comedy career and observations on post-9/11 America, touching upon the changing national mood, national identity, and the use of humor in dealing with sensitive events.  The hosts and Mencia exchanged insults and jokes, and several callers participated in the conversation, sharing anecdotes and opinions aligning with the broadcast's overall tone.

Following Mencia's departure, a caller, Chris, discussed immigration using inflammatory language. Another caller, Jay, criticized the show's perceived negativity towards Indian people, leading to a heated exchange about the show's commentary on the Afghanistan war and collateral damage.  The show then shifted to a Britney Spears ticket contest requiring outrageous listener stunts.  Two mothers initially planned to participate in a sexually suggestive segment failed to show up. A thirteen-year-old boy's call prompted discussion about his age and voice.  A significant technical issue interrupted the broadcast, with Beatles music and news reports inexplicably airing over the Opie and Anthony feed in several locations. The hosts spent considerable time addressing this with callers from affected areas.

The show eventually returned to the Britney Spears contest, featuring Helena, who planned to wear a "Wow" sticker bikini in Times Square, and Erin, who agreed to suck on the hammertoes of "Stalker Patty," a recurring show character. This segment involved a graphic description and visual depiction of Stalker Patty's extremely long and dirty toenails and Erin's subsequent attempt and vomiting after the task.  The hosts and crew members expressed disgust at the event.  The show then transitioned to a discussion of disgustingly unclean feet, escalating to Opie describing extreme nausea after encountering sewage and vomit. A caller, Wayne, expressed his disgust and near decision to turn off the radio.  The hosts then mentioned a planned "What the Hell Is That?" segment featuring medical diagnoses of mysterious body ailments.

The "Mommy, What Would You Do for Britney Spears?" contest continued with Helena in Times Square, removing bumper stickers from her minimal bikini.  Increasingly outrageous interactions with onlookers, including a French tourist, escalated to the point where Helena and Rick fled from the police. Listener calls followed, many referencing the earlier foot discussions and the Times Square events.  The hosts speculated about Helena's contest status, considering her flight from the police a significant performance. Rick later called back, detailing their escape and confirming Helena's win.  The broadcast concluded with the hosts promoting their Boston appearance.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show. It's Friday. Oh man, yeah. Finally. Made it. The  city is an absolute mess, but it's Friday. A couple phone numbers in the New York area, 
[00:00:30]  877-692-1027, anywhere else, including, once again, Boston, Massachusetts. Yes. Because  right after the show, we're traveling up to Boston and we're doing a little CD signing  tomorrow. Can't wait to see some old faces and some new faces at Newberry Comics on Route  9 there as we sign copies of the latest WBCN naked disc, Anthony. I wonder if we'll bump  in anybody up in Boston. I hope a lot of people show up. I'm hoping. What if anyone from New  York will be up in Boston? Why? I don't know. I'm just wondering. I'm wondering maybe if 
[00:01:00]  at our same hotel, maybe. Oh, yeah. That's right. That'll be interesting. Yeah, make believe  you're our friend. Okay, sure. Someone else seems to be here. We'll buy it. We'll buy it  this time. Making a trip up to Boston this weekend and we found out they're staying at  the same hotel. We're staying at. Ah, some nice three in the morning ring and run.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. Skipping. Skipping. Skipping. Who's banging on my door? That ought 
[00:01:30]  to be fun. We'll see what happens. All right. But we're going to have some fun tomorrow afternoon.  Oh, yeah. We want to see all the old faces and the new faces. Come on by. It usually  turns into some kind of an impromptu freak show. True. You know, I casually mentioned  the naked disc yesterday on the show. A lot of people wondering how they could get it from 
[00:02:00]  other cities because it's literally like a greatest hit CD of all the bands that are out  right now, man. Yes. Whoa, what the hell is that? Look at that over there. Yeah. Sorry.  That is pretty nice. You don't expect to see that. Anyway. Wow. Why didn't you go into  some other occupation? Pretty distracting. Isn't that? Man. Makes me want to commit a crime.  Wouldn't mind being frizzed. Anyway. Yeah. Yeah. So I guess you could go to WBCN.com. 
[00:02:30]  I'm having a gun in my sack. And maybe there's a way to get the CD. Right. That features all  the great artists that are out now. Plus Stephen Lynch's lullaby is on the thing. And we donate  a little track called The Nutcracker Suite. Right. On the disc. But tomorrow we'll be signing  copies. Yeah. Come on down. Come on down. All right, Anthony. Where do we begin today? 
[00:03:00]  We got the Mommies coming down to do Mommy. What would you do for Britney Spears tickets?  That will definitely be going down. Any Mommies arrive yet, Rick? Not yet.  Oh, boy. Well, it's very early. Very, very early in the program right now. Oh, boy.  And Carlos Mencia stopping by in about an hour. Yes. Very, very funny guy. It's been a while.  We haven't seen him in, wow, close to a year. I mean, I don't know. Would this sound politically 
[00:03:30]  incorrect if I say it? I don't want to. I mean, this spick will make you laugh. What? He's  a beaner. Oh. He gets mad if you call him a spick.  Because he's a beaner. Same thing, right? He don't care. What? When you talk about  stereotypes. Yeah, I know. Carlos Mencia lets it all hang out. He is very funny. He's  a beaner. Mexican. Wetback, right? He'll call himself a beaner. He'll call himself a wetback.  I know. So, all right. I'm so over-medicated again. Are you? I'm kind of getting pissed because 
[00:04:00]  I think I'm getting better, but I don't want to stop taking the medicines. It's like really,  it's a nice, mellowing buzz the stuff gives you. You could use the excuse for another two  or three days, though. Yeah, but you know what I think happens? You keep taking it, and then  you build up that tolerance for it, and you've got to take more and more, and then you end  up really effed up. Right. You know? Drugs have to be so difficult. Larry, what's going  on? You guys are whoring around again, going back up to Boston like unfaithful girlfriend. 
[00:04:30]  I know. We're slipping out. Don't worry. We'll be back. We'll be back. We'll be back in New  York Monday afternoon. You know we love you, New York. Yeah, we'll let you get away with it  this time. Boston's our kumad. Boston's our mistress, and she is fine. All right, boys,  you guys have a good day. All right, Larry, thank you. No problem. We could do all this  stuff with Boston that we don't do with you, New York, because you have to kiss our kids 
[00:05:00]  on the mouth. That's hysterical. We love the backdoor virgins up in Boston. You watch the  Sopranos, and Tony won't do the stuff with his wife that he does with his mistress because  he kisses his children. She kisses his children. I'm not going to do that with her. There he  is, grabbing the back of some hooker's head. Dean, what's going on? Opie and Anthony, first  of all, let me just tell you, you guys effing rock, man. Thank you, my friend. Calling you 
[00:05:30]  from D.C. I got my WOW sticker. I'm loving it. And I just wanted to comment on that first  little bit that you played about the beef and broccoli, dude, I was cracking up. I  can totally relate to that, man. Oh, that's all for our little Dementor World CD. Thank  you. Oh, man, you guys are the best, man. I love it since you've been down here in JFK  and listened to you since they picked you up, and I'm telling you what, you guys keep me  laughing every day. Well, as soon as we get some type of following down there, we'll be  there. Hey, one last question. Can I come up and DJ at Club Stinky sometime? DJ at Club 
[00:06:00]  Stinky. I can bring my 12s, and I got a mixer, and I can bring up the  some drum and bass and techno and all that. It sounds all well and fine, but I do believe  the Crystal Method will be spinning at Club Stinky very soon. If you ever need a DJ, just  let me know. I'm there. I guess we should tell people we will be having a teen rave party  during our show. Teen rave New Year's party. With Crystal Method when we get back from the 
[00:06:30]  Christmas break. Can we throw pajama in there somewhere, too? Yeah. Teen rave pajama. We're  going to get glow sticks and ecstasy and roofies. I can hook up with rave flyers and all that,  man. We're not kidding, though. Crystal Method's coming on our show in the new year, and we're  going to have a rave party for the teenage girls. Yeah. Our first teenage party of the  new year. Hopefully nobody will get arrested. Yeah, I think we're going to call it the  panties and bra party. Teen panties and bra party. Yeah. Oh, God. With Crystal Method. 
[00:07:00]  Details on the way. How hot is that? Hey, look. You guys take care, all right? All right,  bro. Those guys turned out to be so friggin' cool. The Crystal Method. Hell yeah. When they  sat down with us in Boston, we were like, uh-oh. You know, what are we going to... I hope  these guys are cool. Like, you listen to music like that, and you don't think you're going  to be able to talk and just hang out with guys like that? You know, you figure they'd be  so artistic, they'd be way out there. They turn out to be the coolest, like, regular  love-to-party kind of guys, you know? And they love the show. Yeah, they love the show, 
[00:07:30]  too, so that's great. We're going to party with them. All the power to them. Jen, what's  up? Hey, guys. How are you? Pretty good. Hi. Well, you know, I was at the Grave Rave  in Boston, and I was trying to call you guys ever since then just to let you know how much  we love you guys, and we had a blast. And I saw my picture on the website, and it was  a really bad picture. Who are you? You know, I just wanted to tell you guys that we love  you in Boston. I was driving around at BCN Studios yesterday, and your army was standing  out there with their wow bumper stickers. You know, I was talking to Tony and the gang 
[00:08:00]  up at BCN today, and they go, do you guys realize that your fans just hang outside the  station every Wednesday with wow signs and wow stickers? They were kicking up half the street.  Yeah, he goes, and I leave work 6, 630. It's pitch dark. It doesn't matter to these guys.  They're out there. Yeah. I'm telling you, you guys. That's great. But it's a weird,  like, underground thing happening outside the BCN Studios every Wednesday. They just  hang out with wow signs. Yeah. Oh, yeah, absolutely. Your followers are definitely devoted, and 
[00:08:30]  you guys are awesome. And I had a blast with you guys. You're Tom Brokaw impersonation.  I almost drive off the road when I'm with you. Ah, look at that. Well, Tom's going to be  on the radio very soon because he's really pissed off because Dan Rather is now reporting  from Afghanistan, and you know Tom doesn't like Dan getting one up on him. Tom hates  Dan. The Mike Tyson one where he couldn't spell. Right, right, right. I almost had to pull  over because I was laughing so hard. Very good. Well, Jay. I hope to see you guys tomorrow, 
[00:09:00]  but I had a great time at the Grave Rave, and you guys are awesome. We're expecting a lot  of people to show up tomorrow. It's been a while. Yeah. I mean, the Grave Rave when we were  in Boston, it was kind of tough because it was, you know, we just did some things from the  stage, but this is up to us. Well, I actually, I got to meet you guys. I was up there, and  you guys, you know, you guys are really, really nice, and I believe Anthony, I was talking  to you afterwards outside, and you guys are very, very nice. Shh, shh, shh. Don't tell  anyone. All right, I won't let the secret out that you're not a complete a-hole. Yeah,  we're complete a-holes. People need to know that. Yeah. All right, Jen. We got to go so 
[00:09:30]  we can get to all this fun stuff today, and we'll see you tomorrow at Newberry Comics for the  season. All right. Thank you, guys. You're awesome. All right. Bye. Thank you. Thank  you. Is your ass adequately frothed up? That was kind of nice to hear, Anthony. Yeah. What  the hell? Especially from one of the other cities. All right, you know, we got to get right  into the show today because today's a very special day on the Opie and Anthony show.  It's an anniversary, isn't it? Yeah, we got a lot of new things we're going to be doing  today, but we also have to celebrate the fact that it was a year ago today that 15 people 
[00:10:00]  got arrested because of our fine radio show. Yeah. Another stunt involving a mayor that  went horribly wrong. We never learn. We never learn is right. And we got some clips from  the whole voyeur bus incident. Yeah. That we want to kind of play. You want to start  playing them now? We can do that. How about we take a quick break? You want to do that?  Yeah, because we're going to need some time on this one. Okay. Because then we had the  whole story from CNN. They did a whole piece on it. Yeah, we got to kind of preface some 
[00:10:30]  of these clips. So yeah, we'll take a break and then come back. We're going to take a  quick break. We'll come back. We got some great clips from the voyeur bus incident. It's  unbelievable. You hear the whole arrest go down. You hear the cockiness. A man and I  thinking that we own the NYPD in this town. I know. We'll take care of this in a half hour.  Opie, it was a different time. It was a different time and a different place a year ago here in  New York. You know what I mean? But the NYPD, I remember they all were calling like, dude, you guys  really effed up. I'm sorry. There was nothing we could do on this one. We're like, it's 
[00:11:00]  cool. Yeah. We know. We effed up. It was the brass. Well, it was cool for A and I because  we weren't arrested. And then there's phone calls from Psycho Mark from the back of a police  car. He undid his cuff so he could give us a call live on the air. I'm telling you, twice.  We got some really, really good stuff. Do we have the clip of when they jammed on the brakes  and he went flying? Because they were probably listening to the show on the front and decided to  F with him a little bit. Interactive radio. We got all that, right? Yeah. All right. 
[00:11:30]  Cool. So we'll take a quick break. We'll get right into the voyeur bus stuff. And, you  know, we'll give the commentary, what was going on and all that and CNN and the CNN piece.  And then we'll sign it to mommy. What would you do for Britney Spears? Carlos Mencia.  So we've got an action packed show. Yeah. Brocaw is going to be on the show today. Scott  Muni, I think, is calling in to comment about George Harrison's death. Ah, tragic. And  I think Regis is stopping by today as well. Wow. Well, our Regis. All of them getting  over colds, too, which is amazing that they're able to call up. Have you ever seen the people 
[00:12:00]  that listen to this show? Toby and Anthony. Toothless, drunk, and white trash. Ah, you got  drools. You're checking out the Opian Anthony show. Dropping stuff all over the place.  Dropping stuff on your controls. Oh, that's great. Oh, very good. Very good. All right, 
[00:12:30]  we've got to get right into the voyeur bus thing. It was a year ago today. It went down,  15 people got arrested, spent 27 hours in jail. I don't know why I find that so funny. It's  hilarious. Huge story in New York. Made all the papers. CNN did a piece on it. Matter of  fact, we think CNN got us all in trouble. Yeah, there's so many conspiracy theories to  go along with this voyeur bus story. We still, to this day, don't know exactly what was the 
[00:13:00]  straw that broke the camel's back. Was it the fact that a busload of nude teen girls were  driving down to a city hall? Was it that they were driving back on the same route that the  president was ready to use for his motorcade? Was it the mayor cracking down on this kind  of thing? Was it CNN ratting us out to the mayor? CNN, our exclusive film crew for the  voyeur bus incident. They were on board the bus the whole time. And rumor has it that they 
[00:13:30]  left the bus after it got to city hall and went in and showed the mayor some of the film  that they had just shot, some of the video. And the mayor just said, get this thing off  the road now. There were impromptu police escorts. There were some cops in the cruisers  flanking the bus, snapping pictures, kind of clearing the way for the bus. And I hear  they got in a little bit of trouble. It really was the talk of the city a year ago today. 
[00:14:00]  We had thousands, and I mean thousands of people lined up. It was almost like the Macy's Day  parade. This thing was going from 57th Street here in Manhattan, right down Broadway, right  down Broadway, all the way down to city hall. It's a long ride. And every single corner had  hundreds of people on it with instamatic cameras. There's thousands of pictures out there of  this incident. It was great. So Stinky went through the Boyer bus show all day today and he got 
[00:14:30]  some clips so we can relive the experience, Anthony, a year later, okay? Basically, the  Boyer bus was filled with a bunch of teenagers, topless, cute. The whole side of the bus was a window.  It's a custom made bus. So no matter where you are outside, you can see into this bus. It's not just 
[00:15:00]  regular windows. The whole sides of these buses have been removed and replaced with plexiglass. So  it's like a big rolling fish tank. It's got toilet in it, a bathtub, shower, bunk beds. And these ladies  would live their lives in this bus as it drove around. Sort of a pseudo freedom of expression kind  of a thing driving around. Um, and we loaded it up with, uh, girls, teen, teen girls, 18 and 19, calm down. 
[00:15:30]  And, um, I have to, uh, Anthony from West Orange, no, I was not trying to play a Ramones record.  I'm just, I'm just answering. That's very, very funny. Now, that's very funny. Go ahead, Anthony.  Thank God, man. So, uh, yeah. Sharp as a tank. I love, uh, the sharp listeners. Yeah. So, yeah,  we had a bunch of teenagers on there. Yeah. We had a few girls from the Boyer bus company. We, uh, 
[00:16:00]  then, then it was like, we were trying to figure out who was going to be on the bus. Yeah, that was  another thing. We originally wanted to be on the bus. We wanted to broadcast. You were on the bus.  I was on the bus many times. This is about, I think this was like the third time we did something  with the Boyer bus people. Yeah. We were on the bus, uh, once we drove right down Broadway. Me,  Jay Moore was on the bus. Uh, we, we had done this before. Stephen Lynch. We had all been on the bus.  We had done this before, but this was one thing that we, we planned to root out. We really, uh, uh, 
[00:16:30]  we, we gave advanced warning that we were going to do this. We were very stupid. We screwed up traffic.  We talked about it. Yeah. People were waiting on every, uh, corner. Yeah. And, um, well,  it backfired on us. Right. So on the bus was, uh, the teens, uh, Rick, our producer, uh, Steve  C from Foundry Music. From FoundryMusic.com because he was videotaping everything. Steve,  did you put some video clips of this up on, uh, Foundry Music today? Yes. Yes. I, I linked to all 
[00:17:00]  of them, all the news stories, all the clips, all the audio. Great. Cool. Go to FoundryMusic.com  and you can see, uh, some of the video from a year ago. If, uh, if you don't know what  FoundryMusic.com is, you can get there through OpieAndAnthony.com. Okay? Right.  All right. Uh, so yeah, Steve was there. Jim Norton, we barely knew, uh, Jim at the time. Yeah,  this is pretty much his, uh, baptism under fire. Louis Black from The Daily Show, he does  the Back in Black segment on The Daily Show. He, uh, good friend of the show, was on the bus  that day. Forced on the bus by us. Right. Uh, too. He would, he really did not want to 
[00:17:30]  go on the bus because the image of him, uh, political comedian, uh, getting on this bus  full of new teens might do something to his credibility, but he thought it was just going  to be a quick thing, down Broadway, up sixth, off the bus, no one would notice and it would  be over. I think he came in just to plug a gig. Yeah. And, uh, next thing you know, he's  spending 27 hours in jail. What? Yeah. Bananas in Poughkeepsie. Bananas in, that's right.  Had to be canceled. Bananas, right. And, uh, Voyeur Bus people, CNN. CNN people, Psycho 
[00:18:00]  Mark. Psycho Mark. And some, um, some, uh, writers for one of those smut magazines. Right.  Yeah. Oh, yeah, those guys. What was it? What was it? Hawk Magazine or something? Yeah, Hawk  Magazine, those guys. Right. Okay. I only wish the CNN people had still been on the bus when  it got pulled over and arrested because to see a CNN, uh, Ginny Moos or whatever her name  Yeah, yeah. To see her in jail, it would have been great. All right. So we, uh, we got  some clips together. Yeah. The first one is a clip of Anthony outside. I think you, at 
[00:18:30]  this point, you, we weren't sure if you were going on the bus or not. You were there as,  as we were loading the bus with the teenager. And you know something? Watching everyone get  on the bus, um, I, I really wanted to just go, oh, I'm going to go. Right. I really wanted  to go because it just looked like the most fun you could have on the six wheels. All right.  So let's go to the first clip we got from the voyeur bus incident. All right. We are in  front of the voyeur bus. The door is opening. And, uh, wow. What a crowd. Nice. Unbelievable. 
[00:19:00]  Uh, the door is open, Opie. We have the girls waiting to get on. Uh, black girl here, uh,  two feet, taping it off for the website. Uh, okay. Oh, boy. You can't get the ladies away from  these guys. They are loving it. Man. All right, ladies. If I could have the ladies' attention,  please. Oh, they are all ready. Wait, wait, wait. Eh, can you hear me? They're moving the 
[00:19:30]  crowd against the window. They're taking their shot clock. They're shoving their cans. What  a day for new teams. New teams on the voyeur bus. Oh, man. There were hundreds of guys just  waiting as we loaded the bus. Yes, sir. And keep in mind, this is all in front of Carnegie  Hall. Carnegie Hall. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. That's where we started the whole thing in  front of beautiful Carnegie Hall. I remember we were announcing the teams one by one and  they were all getting a huge applause as they got on the bus. And then they just quickly took 
[00:20:00]  their clothes off. Yeah, it was some scene to see it happen like that. Everyone getting on. And  when you listen to that clip, knowing how this is going to end, it's almost like watching the old  black and white film of the Titanic leaving port there in Liverpool. Everyone happy, having a good  time, and not knowing that a slow death waited for them down the line. Oh, there's some happy  footage of the Zeppelin over New York City. Right, right. The Hindenburg coming in. 
[00:20:30]  The Hindenburg, right. Oh, my. The beautiful Hindenburg as it makes its way here to Lakehurst,  New Jersey. Oh, no. As it soars over. As it soars over Manhattan. Oh, it's the worst  catastrophe I've ever seen. Oh, get out of the way. Oh, I can't. Ladies and gentlemen, I can't  try. The Voyeur bus is being arrested. All the people are coming off their naked teens  in their handcuffs. Oh, I can't take this. Oh, the humanity. All right. So, moving right  along. The next clip. What is this? The bus is in motion? Yes. Yeah. And it's Rick and 
[00:21:00]  Jim Norton checking in to let us know what is going on. Rick's on the line with a very important  update with the Teen Voyeur bus. Rick, what's going on? Rick, what's up? Guys, very important  update. We've just crossed over 7th Avenue and 55th. We are fastly approaching Broadway,  and I do have confirmed reports that, yeah, people are still running alongside the bus.  It kind of reminds me of, you know, when they show in 1977, I believe, when Reggie hit that  third home run. Yeah. One idiot came out to congratulate him. Yeah. That's pretty much 
[00:21:30]  what it looks like. We've got a bunch of idiots running alongside the bus, patting it like  it's their buddy. How could they be idiots if there's new teens on there? Wouldn't you be  running? I would be running. I knew I had to be back here, and I almost ran after the  bus. I wonder how many blocks it's going to take before a lot of these people give up  running after the bus. Yeah. Because, I mean, you're not going to be able to run from here  all the way down to Wall Street. Marathon runners. Guys, we are now at the corner of 55th and Broadway.  The parade route is now officially back on. Yeah, here we go. Down Broadway. And Jim Norton 
[00:22:00]  has some observations. All right. Norton on the bus also. Hello. Hey, Jim. I can't tell  you how turned on I am right now. Is that the best thing? The inside of my pants looks  like a Bundy crime scene. I cannot tell you how hot this is. Isn't that great? Yeah, I'm  getting motion sick because I don't like to travel. This is what a loser I am. Now, what  are some of the reactions to the people outside the bus? Have you ever seen a rapist chase 
[00:22:30]  a bus? Just there are 400 of them, because that's what happens. They're just following the  bus with chloroform and wow stickers. Yeah, people were slapping wow stickers on the bus,  which is fine. Which is fine. He looks like John Wayne Gacy, but without the sexual and  emotional stability. He's following the bus, and he's fat. This guy hasn't jogged since  Spiro Agnew was a governor, and he's following the bus for 40 blocks so far. We're getting  people to exercise. Yeah. I really hope he has a heart attack and dies, because what's better 
[00:23:00]  than a fat man dying and naked women? That's hilarious. And he can clear stuff. Look how  happy he sounded, right? So happy. God, if only we knew the tragedy that would unfold. This  was still very early in the game. Oh, and they had just started their trip. And yeah, all  the people that waited for us outside the station, they decided they were going to run with the  bus as long as they could. Yeah. There were people on every mode of transportation. There  were people on motorcycles, bicycles, cars, just running. It was amazing. All the people 
[00:23:30]  that were following the bus. Yeah. Psycho Mark. Hi, guys. Oh, what a day. Another one of  the arrested people of that day. Oh, what fun that was. I'll tell you. I actually wasn't  even going to get on the bus. It was sort of a last minute decision of, oh, let me run down  the C Hall and jump on the bus for fun. Let me tell you something. I believe, now, you  know they've done stories about the bus since then. They did one just yesterday, I believe,  talking about how the bus is ripped apart in an impound lot. Do you know why that bus 
[00:24:00]  was stripped to the extent it was, Mark? No. Can you tell me? I believe they were looking  for something on the air. Mark gets on and goes, guys, I stashed my pot somewhere on the  bus because I don't want to have it on me when I'm arrested. This is when the cops are just  boarding the bus. You could hear them in the background telling everyone,  they get off the bus, and Mark's on the phone like, I got to stash my pot. And of course,  they hear all this. Well, they ripped the bus apart looking for Mark's pot. We're going  to get to that clip, Anthony, in a few minutes. Yeah, that's a great one. 
[00:24:30]  And that was a great part, too. And I had a footnote to that, too. I had met some detectives  that work for the police commissioner, and they told me that the bus, they still have the  bus, and they plan on using it for police functions. There you go. All right, Mark, call us  back. Yeah, I'll call you back when the rest gets going. Yeah, when we get to your  part. Yeah, well, you get to my part. That's most important. All right, Mark. When I get  Rick in trouble in the back of the paddy wagon. All right, Mark. How did I feel Rick getting  wrapped up by a cop? You liked that, didn't you, you fag? What are you talking about? You're 
[00:25:00]  making something up again, Mark? No, you remember in the back of the bus? No. I got my handcuffs  free, and I made a phone call live in the air, right? All right. So how did I get in trouble?  How did you get in trouble? That's because when the cops came back into the back of the band and said,  who's on the cell phone? I pointed to you, tough guy. They grabbed you, and they handled  you. How could you point to me with your hands behind your back, and you didn't even touch  me? I pointed with my big, long Irish nose, you dumbass. Lying. Lying. All right. Rehab.  All right. Rehab. Believe it or not, these two spent 28 hours in jail together without killing 
[00:25:30]  each other. It's a miracle. Some of those clips, like the one I was talking about with Mark,  or when Rick is talking, and you hear the cops in the background, it's almost like that scene.  I mean, I think the movie was Platoon, where they're on the radio with the radio guy, and  he's talking real low, and you hear the, oh, the gooks in the background, you know it's  over for them. And then it goes silent. That's exactly what it was like. All right. Our third  clip, the bus is well on its way now. There's people just losing their minds, people on every 
[00:26:00]  corner, just thousands of people. No joke. And Nathan Lane, the Nathan Lane, calls from a cab.  No joke. Yeah. Somewhere down, yeah, I guess we're getting close to City Hall at this point.  Yeah. So let's go to that clip now. Hello.  Hello. Yes.  Is it who am I calling? Is this L.B. and Anthony?  Yeah. Yes, it is.  Yes, we're calling. This is Nathan Lane calling from the Lyceum. I am. Is this the opener?  Are you guys responsible for the bus? 
[00:26:30]  Wait, is this really the Nathan Lane?  I'm honored that you know me, sir. Yes, this is Nathan Lane.  The actor, Nathan Lane.  Broadway, yes. Starring as the man who came to dinner, yes.  It's Nathan Lane. Are you kidding? Do you listen to this program?  No, not usually. A cabbie told me that some kooks on the radio are responsible for this  bus that's causing traffic.  Yes, we would have to be responsible for that, sir.  Beautiful, beautiful. We've never had anything like this on Broadway. 
[00:27:00]  It is young.  You never announced auditions, for God's sake.  Young nude girls.  Beautiful, beautiful. Well, let me tell you, I'm on my way to dinner.  We said girls.  Absolutely wonderful. Can't thank you enough. It's been an enjoyable and unusual ride home.  Well, thank you, Nathan.  Loved you in birdcage.  Absolutely. Take care, gentlemen.  All right. Bye.  Nathan Lane, everyone. That would have actually been Nathan Lane.  I don't know.  Sounded like him. 
[00:27:30]  Sounded like him a little bit, right?  I don't think the real Nathan Lane would be that excited about teen girls.  Ah, Jesus.  Yeah.  You know, listening back...  The celebrities checking in.  Well, listening back to that, that was definitely Nathan Lane.  Yeah, I know.  Let me go to Eric. He's got a comment.  Eric, what's up?  What's up, boys?  Listen, I was wondering if you guys, maybe later on in the show, were going to play some  of the clips later on in the evening when you guys were on Ron and Fez into the Afro  show.  Yeah.  You guys sounded so horribly dejected.  Well, we were staying on the air as long as we could. 
[00:28:00]  Hopefully...  Yeah, the best line, I think, was Opie when Opie said, F Don and Mike, we're just going  to continue on.  Yeah, well, we had to.  We had to wait around, hoping that our guys were going to get out of jail.  But little did we know it wasn't going to happen until late the next day.  Yeah, Opie, not to none.  I think you're a pussy.  I think you knew what was going to happen.  You'd never leave the studio for any of these things.  You know what's up, man.  All right, all right.  All right, boys, have a good weekend.  Good luck in Boston.  All right, bye.  Yeah, we're going to have fun tomorrow.  Okay, so moving right along, now we got a clip of Mark getting thrown off the bus. 
[00:28:30]  Psycho Mark?  Yeah.  Anthony from West Orange again saying, Nathan was looking for the Boyer bus.  Very funny.  All right, check out this clip from the Boyer bus.  Went down a year ago today.  Rick, we just had a cop call that says he's in the motorcade and has reported that Psycho Mark  is mooning the crowd through the window.  Well, yeah, I dropped him.  Tell a good.  He was on the verge of turning around and screaming, you want to see my job?  This isn't what the Boyer, Teen Voyer bus is about, Psycho Mark's house.  What a tool. 
[00:29:00]  It impedes what we're trying to do here for the good of the community, Anthony.  I would say if they've just got to take 6th Avenue straight up now, you throw them off  the bus right now.  Yeah, we don't need them if we know where we're going.  Oh, that's true.  But Psycho Mark's going to ruin it.  Yeah, he is.  And he keeps touching girls, so I've got to keep feeling them off of them as well.  Throw them off the bus.  All right.  Hey, Mark.  Mark, come here.  Can you pull over a sec?  Can you pull over? 
[00:29:30]  We're going to get the bus driver to pull over.  Hold on a second.  Rick, no wacky radio bid.  Really do it.  No, no, no.  I'm just going to make sure he gets off the bus.  All right.  All right.  We'll pull it over.  It's amazing.  There are cops on every freaking corner, guys.  They got the lights going.  We're pulling over real quick.  They want you to run out and talk to the cop up there real quick.  All right.  Who do you want me to talk to you about?  Just tell them where we're going.  Please, please.  Tell them where we're going.  Be stupid.  For the first time in your life, be stupid.  All right.  Hold on.  Here he goes. 
[00:30:00]  We've let Mark out.  All right.  Driver, can you close the door?  Close the door?  Okay, let's go.  Let's go.  Just keep driving.  Keep driving.  Yeah!  See you later.  This is just me throwing it back in.  Keep going.  He's jumping in the front of the bus.  Let him back in.  Hey, Mark.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  You're a filthy pot. 
[00:30:30]  He's on front of the bus,  and he will not get off.  He's like a real argument,  for Christ's sake.  He's getting on.  I think we better stop.  We better stop.  We better stop.  All right.  I'll check in with you in a second.  God.  That's pretty funny.  So there you have it.  They threw a second mark off,  but he refused to leave.  What an idiot.  He jumped on the front of the bus  as the bus is moving forward.  That was his chance.  That was his chance.  That was it.  He was off the bus.  He didn't have to get arrested.  But he was causing such a scene,  they stopped the bus and put him back on. 
[00:31:00]  I got to be on that bus.  From that clip,  you heard all the cops  that were helping us out, man.  There were cops on the corner.  Oh, yeah.  They were all over the place.  They were escorting the bus  as it was heading down Broadway  to City Hall.  All right.  Let's get right to the next clip.  This is when it went down.  Oh, this is when we got arrested.  The arrest.  Uh-oh.  Notice how quickly the attitude changes.  All right.  Here we go.  Uh-oh.  Thank you, Mike.  We got to go to the Teen Warrior bus.  Major problem. 
[00:31:30]  Pulled over by cops.  Uh-oh.  What happened?  So close.  Let's go to Psycho, Mark.  Mark.  Dude, we're getting pulled over  right on 6th Ave here.  Right in front of the library here  at West Audion.  Why?  Right in front of the park.  I don't know.  My head, one of the lieutenants came  and says,  pull that bus over right now.  It looks like there are left  to all of us, I think.  No.  I swear to God.  They got a bunch of,  I went from a college.  It's like we're all screwed.  We might all be getting arrested. 
[00:32:00]  Let's go to Rick.  Maybe he knows something.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Let's go to Rick.  Rick.  Rick.  Hey, guys.  Holy crap.  These guys are coming out  with those things you use  to cut people,  those quick little plastic things.  Oh, stop.  I'm serious.  If this is one of those gags.  Dude, this is not a freaking gag.  There is a major problem happening.  I don't mean you.  I mean a police department gag.  I don't know, man.  I think the cops  that are on our sides  are talking to the cops  that are being told  to do something about it.  We've got a woman  with a very official-looking 
[00:32:30]  bat on  who might be controlling  the situation, so to speak.  Meanwhile, you've got  the other cops  who are hanging out.  They're taking pictures.  So there's definitely  something going on here.  I don't know if we're going  to be rolling away.  We're right in front of...  Tell Mark to flush the dope.  There's a toilet in there.  We're right on the corner  of 40th and 6th Avenue.  We're real close  to the station.  Oh, God.  We almost made it back.  Real close.  Psycho Mark,  I got a PBA card.  Do you know who I am? 
[00:33:00]  Wow.  So they might arrest  the whole audience, huh?  I don't know what's happening.  That's going to cost  a lot of money.  But there's some  angry-looking females  who look like  they've got official badges  on or something  pointing at things.  A sheriff car.  Oh, boy.  We're just waiting, Rick.  Yeah, I'm still waiting  to find out  what the heck's going on.  None of the cops  seem to want to come  on the bus  to actually say anything  to us.  Did the girls  put their clothes back on?  But the one guy who's  yelled that we had  to pull over immediately. 
[00:33:30]  Did the girls  put their clothes back on?  It looks like everybody's  got their jackets on,  their clothes.  There's an older  chief of police guy  who was explaining  something.  Somebody's getting  yelled at.  Somebody's getting  yelled at big time.  Let's all cross  our fingers here, Anthony.  Come on.  Let them go.  They're almost here.  Yeah, we're 14 blocks away. 
[00:34:00]  Hold on.  My name is  Stan Hughes.  Certain people are served  by plain clothes off  this is called  public exposure, right?  It's a misdemeanor charge  for some of the females  on the bus.  There's no charge  it's vehicles charged  and also no advertisements  on the bus,  things of that nature.  So what we're going to do now  is subject to something  for on a bus  and there are subject  for arresting.  We're going to go  to the Big Town  South Station.  Are you kidding?  But we need your cooperation. 
[00:34:30]  So right now I need  pretty much all the males  on the bus  to stay down  and stay out of the way  of the aisle  in the clear aisle.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, look.  All right.  All right.  You guys heard that.  Let's bring the cops in.  Did you hear that?  Yeah.  Let's bring the cops in.  No, this is no business.  I understand.  How many people  are on the bus?  All right.  Look, we need  some big brass  to get over there  and remedy this situation. 
[00:35:00]  This situation  must be remedied.  What are they?  Ruining a good time.  They reined it.  They ruined our parade.  Oh, you can't.  You can't end it like this.  Yeah, and we are now  being boarded.  We're being boarded.  Get out of here, Rick.  I'm serious.  Bring the...  Stay out of the bus.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  And everyone...  We have been boarded.  And everyone gets arrested  at the end of this.  Oh.  Wait, Rick, 
[00:35:30]  what's going on?  They're going for a wagon, dude.  Come on.  I'm serious.  It must be rooting.  Oh, come on.  They can't arrest  the voyeur bus.  This is legal, isn't it?  We didn't know.  Isn't it?  Well, no.  I mean,  they've been doing this  for over a week here.  Oh, now we're going  to have to come up  with cash.  Yeah, we're going  to have to get  some serious cash.  Let's get some people  over there to remedy  this, NYPD.  Come on.  Lots of phones 
[00:36:00]  seem to be ringing  now on the cops' end.  Help us out.  Cell phones are going  off like crazy.  They're...  All right, so the bus  has stopped  at 40th and 6th...  40th and 6th Avenue.  How many cops  are around the bus?  There are...  lots of police  now on the bus itself.  They've got to take  care of this.  Um...  Mmm...  I need, uh... 
[00:36:30]  to be able to sign  a rest of this time.  I need an arresting...  They're actually...  They're actually now  getting arresting  officers.  Oh, here's the guy.  Uh-oh.  Somebody else.  Somebody bigger.  You've got to be kidding me.  Uh-oh.  Now we're going to...  Now we're going to  task force.  They're keeping  everyone on the bus.  What?  Yeah.  I guess they don't  want to get a paddy wagon.  I figure they're just  going to take the bus,  put cops on it, 
[00:37:00]  and take us over  someplace.  There's also a...  There's a captain  on line 10 that says  that you and I  are going to be  arrested too,  Ann.  For the, uh...  For the, uh...  For my guys to  follow me over there.  Oh, well.  For public news.  Yeah, we're listening.  Just keep going.  All right.  Everybody follow the bus.  All right.  They're telling everybody  to follow the bus.  The other cops, I guess.  Someone please away.  You know,  I'm kind of confused.  I don't know.  I mean, we've been  led by the NYPD  throughout this entire event. 
[00:37:30]  Send Obi-Wan  to shut off  the tractor beam  and then just take the, uh...  Boy, give me those  flex cuffs.  Oh, this might have  been a clever ruse.  They're getting flex cuffs.  Might have been  a clever ruse.  The cops were actually  working for the other side.  Okay, I've got to hang up.  Getting them to a location.  I've been told to hang up.  Uh, Rick?  I've got to hang up.  They're telling me to hang up.  If you could dial the number,  you know,  any time during the proceeding  and let us know, okay?  Rick?  Oh, boy.  What happened? 
[00:38:00]  We just...  What happened?  Maybe Rudy,  he wants a personal show.  What happened?  What the hell happened there?  I'm having flashbacks  to Boston.  They just...  They reamed it.  Oh, man.  Wow, man.  That is...  I just got the chills  listening to that again.  I haven't heard that in a year.  That's painful to listen to.  Wow.  You know, the best part of that  was listening to In Context,  Rick saying,  this is legal, isn't it?  I know.  We've been playing that clip  for a year,  and to hear him actually say it  as he said it,  I thought we were playing  a little drop-ins there. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  See you next Tuesday,  checking and saying,  this is painful, isn't it?  Mm-hmm.  Wow.  Woo!  Yeah, that's rough.  So, we're going to fast forward  to Psycho Mark  in the back of the paddy wagon now.  Paddy wagon, yeah.  I mean, there were a hundred...  I mean, what?  Hundreds of cops showed up?  There were hundreds of cops.  At least 50, 60 cars.  And then hundreds of our listeners  on the scene.  And then listeners,  and then all of a sudden  news crews showed up,  but the news crews showed up  just as we were thrown  into the paddy wagon. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  So they couldn't get us  coming off the bus.  But people were cheering  because it happened  right in front of Brian Park.  Right.  So people are standing up,  you know,  hanging onto buildings,  you know,  up in trees,  screaming,  holding up wow signs,  and we got arrested.  This is legal, isn't it?  Well, no.  No.  No.  Once again,  we got a lot of stuff  that on the voyeur bus  on foundrymusic.com.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  Yes, see it for yourself.  Go to opianathlete.com  for the link 
[00:39:30]  if you can't spell  foundry music.  Okay.  Here's Psycho Mark  as we fast forward  a little bit.  And calling from the back  of the paddy wagon,  he undid his handcuffs.  Psycho Mark.  Hey, guys.  Hey, what's going on?  We are on the back  of the paddy wagon right now  headed to a police station.  You're going to the police station?  We're all getting arrested  right now.  Who's back there with you?  Everybody.  Lewis Black, me,  the bus driver.  Oh, my God.  We got Lewis Black arrested.  Oh, my God.  We got Lewis Black arrested.  Are you live on the air  right now?  Yeah. 
[00:40:00]  He's too neurotic for this.  Yeah, I got my hands  free cuff,  so I was able  to make the phone call.  And I was able  to get rid of my stash.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Hee, hee, hee.  Good thing.  Don't worry.  I got plenty of PBA cards.  Do you know  where you're going?  No, I have no idea.  But we are getting escorted.  They are blocking  streets off  like we're the Hezbollah.  Oh, my God.  I swear to God,  it's madness.  We've got a full police escort.  We've got cops  blocking everything off.  It's just sanity.  Oh, my God. 
[00:40:30]  What are they?  Are they still laughing?  What's that?  What are they laughing  back there?  The cops are right now.  They're laughing  and all the other people  on the street.  But it's unbelievable.  We've got cameras  left and right following  us.  All the news channels.  Channel 9 was there.  A bunch of channels  were all up front.  It was hysteria.  Oh, my God.  Dude, it was.  I mean, there must have  been 50 or 60 cops  arresting us.  They all had the plastic  bands ready to go  and everything.  Holy smokes.  I think so.  So now what we think  is going to happen 
[00:41:00]  is you're all going to  get like desk  appearance tickets.  Okay.  And because it's like  it's only a misdemeanor  rap.  And then we're  at 32nd Street  and I'm not  holding on to that.  I can't believe  he's got a phone  working on the back  of the couch.  We're going on  second half right  now with a huge  police escort.  With a big  police escort?  We have huge  police escort.  He's barking up.  Damn it.  What? 
[00:41:30]  Get this handcuff  back in, okay?  I can't.  Mark.  Yeah, I got to  get going, all right?  I got to put the  phone down, all right?  All right, all right.  I got to put my  handcuffs back on  because we're coming  close to the station.  All right?  All right, man.  As soon as we figure  out where the hell  we're going.  We're going on  second half right now.  Well, Mark.  We're going to bat on  the hell.  Mark, obviously we  have to get off the  air ourselves, so just  call us in our office,  all right?  Very good.  See you guys later.  Bye.  Bye.  Oh, my God.  Jesus Christ. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, man, was that  funny?  Psycho Mark.  Psycho Mark in the  back of the paddy  wagon.  We're back live here.  Yeah.  I hid my stash.  And that's why they  destroyed the bus,  because of that  comment right there.  There's drugs on the  bus, we're getting  them.  Right.  And then the funny  part is, during that  whole call, Lewis is  looking at me going,  if this little idiot  gets me in bigger  trouble because of his  stupid pot, I'm going  to kill him.  Psycho Mark.  Yeah, what's up,  guys?  How you doing?  That was very fun. 
[00:42:30]  That was funny,  man.  They got roads  blocked off like  where the Hezbollah  was the best line.  Huh, Mark?  The worst part was  the cops slamming  the brakes and  throwing us all  against the fence,  you know?  Yeah.  Rick was so scared  because I was going  to have everyone  bust because my  marijuana, you  big sissy.  Yeah, right.  Okay, Mark.  All right, Mark.  I got to let you  go because Lewis  Black is checking  out.  Somebody funny.  Lewis.  All right, let me  go to Lewis.  Lewis Black.  Hey, guys.  What's up, man?  Just hearing the  sound of that tape,  I can smell 
[00:43:00]  prison again.  Yeah.  Boy, that was a  year ago.  That was a year ago.  My career's in the  dumpster, so I'm  suing WNEW.  You assume that  was because of  your arrest.  That's it.  It hasn't been  the same since.  Have you had a  bologna and cheese  sandwich?  I don't even look  bologna, you know?  And Kool-Aid, I  tear it off the  shelves.  He doesn't like any  of the prison food  anymore for some  reason.  Really?  And when I see how 
[00:43:30]  sharp it, I just  get livid.  Lewis, a year later,  has this experience  changed your life at  all?  My career's in the  dumpster now, you  know?  Yeah, I don't think  you can blame that  on jail.  God, I thought I  would get that one  by you.  No, of course not.  How are you guys  doing?  Things are good, man.  Come see you soon.  I'm going to come in  next week.  Oh, great.  Yeah, I'm back  finally.  I've been on the  road so much.  Just try to make  you up for that. 
[00:44:00]  Well, we'll get you  arrested again, get  you some publicity.  Oh, yeah.  No, that was really  something I never,  ever want to go  through.  Yeah.  Except for my  affection for Norton  grew.  Yeah.  Well, he's  didn't.  Yeah, of course.  I've been to a  man.  We were convinced  there would be a  couple hours and  everything would have  been cleared up and  the guys would have  been free.  27 hours later, they  were free.  27 hours later and  nobody was arrested  and it was, I mean,  you know, for  absolutely nothing.  Yeah.  No charges  sticked.  Right.  They were just doing 
[00:44:30]  it to bust balls.  That's pretty much  it.  Giuliani.  Well, it was  Giuliani's work there  that allowed him to  do the kind of work  he did later.  That's what I think.  Is that it?  It was that kind of  ability to just cut  through everything and  arrest, you know,  people who were doing  nothing wrong allowed him  really to be able to deal  with the Twin Towers  incident.  Hey, Lewis, when are you  going to apologize to me  about goofing on me  talking about Yemen?  What about talking about  Yemen?  Remember last time you 
[00:45:00]  were in, I said we've got  to go in and F up Yemen  because they're  responsible too and now  Yemen is on the short  list.  Of course it's on the  short list.  You laughed at me when I  said, what about Yemen?  No, it was why not Yemen?  I go, why not Yemen?  And you started laughing  at me.  Well, I did start laughing  at you and I continue to  laugh at you because I'm  no military expert.  All right.  Well, you come in next  week.  We're going to discuss all  this fine stuff.  Right.  Yeah.  Because, you know,  because we get it.  And I'm surprised you're  still working on the show.  I'm surprised you haven't  gone into military  intelligence. 
[00:45:30]  Working on it,  Lewis.  You can take that  little box of yours  with you.  My sound effect box  and everything?  Sure.  You tell the troops  what to do and then  you go, that's what I  want.  See, Keelmer Coon.  Hey, Rick's got  something for you.  Hey, Lewis, remember  the lone camera crew  that was waiting for you  outside the jail?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  My daily show crew.  They actually sent the  camera crew and Lewis  got out of jail to  videotape him. 
[00:46:00]  And 27 hours later,  he's all disheveled.  He's smoking a cigarette.  He looks at the camera  with an F you look  on his face.  And they played it  on the daily show.  They did.  And that was really  that.  Did you see my latest?  You know, they almost  had me going nude  today.  Oh, great.  We didn't do it.  I just thought,  that's what you  we can't do that.  Yeah.  Well, you had your  shirt off on one  and now you're  almost nude.  I'm almost naked.  It's the last  desperate attempt  to keep me on the air.  See?  Hey, Lewis,  your phone's crapping 
[00:46:30]  out.  You've got to come  in next week.  I will.  I'm in Caroline's  next weekend.  You guys come.  All right.  Right on.  We'll be there.  Okay.  All right.  We'll see you next  week, Lewis.  You got it.  Bye-bye, guys.  Thank you.  Our buddy, our  pal still to this  day, Lewis Black  from The Daily Show.  Jess, what's up?  Hello?  One of the naked  teens that got  arrested.  Yes.  Hi, guys.  I'm just driving  my car.  I'm getting cold sweat,  like thinking about  being in jail with  all the fat hookers  trying to hook us up  with their pimps.  They treated us so badly.  They were pushing us  around.  We sat there eating 
[00:47:00]  rotten bologna.  Oh, wait.  I like that language.  Potty mouth.  You learned in the  joint, didn't you?  Teen potty mouth.  Teen potty mouth.  Oh, I'm so sorry, guys.  And it was rotten  mayonnaise and mustard.  Yeah.  Yes.  It was disgusting.  It was horrible.  They ruined such a good  time.  Jess, how old are you now?  I want you guys not to  touch anything because  you'll get TB or  something?  Yeah.  Tuberculosis.  Yeah, I think that  we weren't touching  and we're standing up the  whole time like  huddling with each other.  Is Jess still a teen?  No, I turned 20.  Oh, we lost another 
[00:47:30]  teen.  We lost another teen.  That's okay.  We can make more.  All right, Jess.  So it was a good time  and they ruined it for us  but I'm over it.  I had like years of  therapy.  All right.  Well, thanks.  Take care.  Thanks for checking in,  Jess.  All right.  There she goes.  One of the teens that  were arrested a year ago.  And finally,  we got one last clip here.  All right.  I think we finally got  an officer on the air  live to tell us 
[00:48:00]  what the hell  is going on.  We got an officer  on the line.  Officer Mike.  Mike.  All right.  Here's the deal.  The guy who was on the line  about five minutes ago,  he was correct.  The order did come down  from one PC.  Okay.  They basically,  Giuliani,  from what I understand,  they re-read this  through OEM,  which is emergency  management.  And they got their  people deployed out there.  They got the top hats,  the brass guys  deployed out there.  Some sergeants  are going to wind up  eating some transfers 
[00:48:30]  because if that was true  that they weren't doing  what they were supposed  to do,  somebody's going to be  looking for scapegoats  and they're going  to buy it.  You guys are definitely  going to be going  through central booking  though.  So I would definitely,  if you're going to have  some of your lawyers  get down there,  that's where they're  going to be going.  They're not going to be  giving desk appearance  tickets.  They're going to be  put through the system  because like I said  before,  you guys basically  on a sphincter  factor it went to 10,  you're rated a 26.  So, you know,  the bottom line  is they're going 
[00:49:00]  to make an example  because of the fact  that Clinton's in town  and everything like that.  But, you know,  it's bulls**t.  I mean,  the bottom line is,  you know,  if you would have  went on a different route,  you probably wouldn't  have had to deal  with this,  you know,  like everything else.  Ouch.  We have to do it  when Clinton's in town.  Well, you know,  hey,  this is all planning,  you know,  but the bottom line  is that they're  definitely going to  go through the system  because just listening  to what's going on  on Citywide and SOD,  special ops frequency, 
[00:49:30]  they're definitely  going to be bringing  them down  to go to central  booking, so.  All right,  so what do we need  lawyers down there?  Yeah,  I would think  that would be  recommended.  All right,  well,  thanks a lot,  Mike.  That guy ended up  being very accurate  with what happened.  Yeah,  pretty much.  And then from there,  27 hours later,  everyone was released  and then it took  a few months  for the charges  to be dropped  as far as the ladies went.  And that's a quick  look back,  really.  Right.  Some of the highlights.  I mean,  it was a four-hour thing 
[00:50:00]  that we were doing.  I think we were  blowing off commercials  and everything.  Yeah.  At that point,  so.  Anthony,  Carlos Mencia  is going to be  on the radio today.  Yes.  Mommy,  what would you do  for Britney Spears tickets?  How many mommies  have shown up?  I think we got  two so far.  Two so far.  Very good.  We'll talk to them next.  Tom Brokaw on the way,  Regis on the way.  Yeah.  Maybe Scott Muni  talking about George Harrison.  And we have one more  thing to play for you  as we wrap up  the anniversary  of the Teen Voyeur bus  incident.  Yeah.  It's the report  that was on CNN 
[00:50:30]  about the whole thing.  Check this out.  You know what they say  about people  who live in glass houses?  Well,  a group of scantily clad  women living  in a glass bus  face some legal trouble  and it's not  for throwing stones.  Our Jeannie Most  makes the most  of a visit  from the lawyer bus.  Remember all the attention  lavished on that  rider truck  carrying Florida ballots?  Well,  that same day  in New York,  we focused on a bus  carrying cargo  that made even  dimpled ballots  seem flat. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah!  What was it  about this vehicle  that had grown men  pounding on the windows?  and standing  on a hood  to gawk.  All we're doing  is making people happy.  We were the half-dozen  half-naked women  aboard Voyeur bus,  a promotional vehicle  for a girly website  that claims to champion  free speech  on the internet.  You didn't need speech  to read the minds  of motorists  who pulled up  alongside the bus's  picture windows.  I'm feeling very 
[00:51:30]  overdressed.  I know.  Most of the women  described themselves  as groupies  of the Opie and Anthony  radio show  broadcasting live  from the bus.  Let's go back  to Ricky's  on the Dean Boyer bus.  Normally,  the bus travels  around the country  with two models  paid to live in it,  live in full view  of the outside world.  I think we kissed  about 50 guys  through the window  last night.  But 50 paled  compared to the crowds  the radio show  attracted.  For half an hour, 
[00:52:00]  they've been running,  running, running,  just to catch up with us.  And it wasn't just  pedestrians trying  to catch a peak.  There was the FedEx  guy looking like  he'd just received  a package from heaven.  Hi, baby!  I'll see you  to come on the bus.  Lo and behold,  who should appear?  Not Reindeer,  but the police.  We saw more than  one officer  taking Polaroids.  Either for evidence  or for fun,  we don't know which.  I'm having a blast 
[00:52:30]  of my life.  Until police finally  pulled the bus over  and arrested everyone.  As for police  who at times  seem to be giving  the bus an escort.  That police officer  has been suspended.  That's not right  because there was  more than one.  There was more than one.  They shouldn't take it out  I'm just one cop.  The voyeur bus folks  have filed a $20 million  lawsuit against the city  for illegal arrest.  Although it's cold out here,  but I just want you all  to take a look  at these ladies  because one has to wonder 
[00:53:00]  why the mayor  would want to  arrest these ladies  for being  and dressing  in the manner  that they dress.  stupid.  They're absolutely stupid.  I mean, of course  you're going to get arrested  if you take your clothes off.  This is the kind of story  that gives you goosebumps  and leaves you bewitched,  bothered,  and bewildered.  Jeannie Moe,  CNN, New York.  What a nice way  to end our inaugural edition  of CNN Tonight. 
[00:53:30]  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  And we're back  with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Our buddies in the studio, Anthony.  Yes, Carlos.  It's been way too long.  Carlos Mencia.  Yeah.  Stopping by to say hi.  He's playing Rascals tonight  in Ocean Township, New Jersey.  And then tomorrow night  they got you at  Rascals of West Orange, right?  I didn't know I was doing  two different Rascals.  I don't know how that works.  I don't know how that works,  but I guess you guys know. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah, so we only have them  for like 40 minutes or so  because it's a long ride.  I know why you guys  are cool, by the way.  Now I know why I like you guys  because I do radio stations  all over the country  and you guys are the only guys  that actually have  the same headphones.  Oh, true.  That actually share  the same headphones.  You know what I mean?  They're the same.  You know, normally one guy  has got the really cool ones  and the other guy  is trying to be like Imus  with the little thing underneath  and you know what I mean?  The little faggoty one  with the, I'm dying Imus.  That's why I wear  my big fag cowboy hat 
[00:54:30]  on my hip.  Yeah, you wear cowboy hats.  You can't wear these  type of headphones.  Yeah, whatever, dude.  You know, he could get  the cool Sony ones,  you know what I mean?  You wear these crappy ones,  McCord, you jerk.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then his buddy,  that other dude,  whoever he is,  wears the same ones,  you know, like,  I'm the kiss ass.  I really have no opinion,  but I'm going to pretend I do,  but I'm going to say  whatever you say,  you're right.  And he just agrees  and then like takes it  a little further.  Actually, it's not  headphones,  they're a stethoscope. 
[00:55:00]  I listen to my horn  and see if it stops  during the show.  Oh, shut up, McCord,  you jerk.  But you guys have it,  so that's cool.  They're similar headphones.  I got yelled at  because I was talking  about you about it  an hour ago  and I said,  yeah, he's a beaner  and stuff.  Oh, yeah, did you?  Some listeners,  he's not a beaner,  he's from Honduras.  Everybody,  first of all,  I came here  when I was three months old,  all right?  So let's get that  out of the way  just because I was  born somewhere else.  You know,  if Honduras ever 
[00:55:30]  attacks America,  I don't want to be  on that boat  of you people saying,  oh, what side  are you on, Carlos?  You know what I mean?  That happens though, man.  Well, yeah,  look at all the  Middle Eastern people  in America, man.  Round them up.  It sucks, man.  And I, you know,  I got a little brown look,  so I've had that  confusing, like, you know.  I'm from Honduras,  get out of here.  You've got to speak  Spanish every once  in a while.  Yeah, then I'll say,  all right, he's cool.  Yeah, exactly.  And I used to be like,  uh-oh, watch my wallet.  Whoa, it's awesome.  Dude, it's so cool, man. 
[00:56:00]  And I hate to say this,  but ever since  September 11th,  blacks and beaners  can walk into  Walmarts  and steal  whatever we want, man.  I got toothpaste.  I'm serious.  I stole some  Route 66 jeans  from Kmart  the other day.  Just because you could.  Just because I could.  I swear to God.  Just because I could.  It was awesome, man.  I thought it was great.  It was badass.  Everyone's looking  for Middle Eastern guys now.  Yeah, and everybody's American.  And remember the last time  I called,  there was some Italian guy 
[00:56:30]  that called in all pissed off  and he's like,  I'm an Italian-American.  And I'm like,  no, you're not.  You're an American  of Italian descent, maybe.  But you're not  Italian-American.  And he was all  pissed and tripping.  I bet you if he called now,  he'd tell you he's an American.  Hell yeah.  You know what I'm saying?  Everyone very proud  of being an American right now.  Goddamn American.  You see that?  It's politically incorrect  to not be an American  and very proud of the country.  But it's only like,  it's only like American  to a certain point still.  You know what I mean?  It's like,  be an American,  be proud,  but don't dislike other people.  You know what I mean? 
[00:57:00]  Don't be discriminant.  That's not right.  Have you noticed  we've engaged in somewhat  of a politically correct war?  The whole war effort,  it has to...  We bomb them and feed them.  It's never ever happened before.  How sick is that?  You know what that's like,  though?  That's like when,  you know,  that's kind of like  when in wrestling,  when the really big  Andre the Giant  fought the midgets.  He never hurt them.  You know what I'm saying?  That's how this war is.  You know what I mean?  Because you've got to  remain like them.  Yeah,  because it's,  come on,  it's like the Taliban. 
[00:57:30]  You know what I'm saying?  It's three guys  with a camel going,  we will kill you.  You know what I mean?  It's funny.  It's like a goof,  you know?  We're like,  come on.  I do like how confident  they are  before we go in there  with anything.  Come over here.  We will show the Americans.  They use some kind  of terminology  like saber rattling  and some old,  you know,  we will show you  like we showed  and then they look  at history from years ago.  And it's like,  ah,  we know how this  is going to end.  Sure.  God damn,  we know. 
[00:58:00]  And they never give up  that dumb ass comment.  They sit there  and no matter how much  we beat the crap out of them,  they retreat  to their last stronghold  where they're still  getting their ass kicked  and they go,  we are still fighting  and we will show you  Americans with it.  You're losing terribly.  And they're going to lose.  Yeah,  you were going to lose.  There's no way.  You pissed us off  to the point.  You should have just,  a little stick and move,  stick and move  like they did  during the Clinton administration.  Right.  They blow a hole 
[00:58:30]  in one of our battleships.  They tear down an embassy,  stick and move.  You take down  two of our buildings  here in Manhattan.  You could take  the Pentagon out.  It's like,  now you pissed us.  Now you really screwed up.  The whole thing is  that everybody thought  that because we're  fighting with each other,  like amongst each other,  like white people  are like,  you know,  hey man,  and black people  are like,  what's up?  And you know,  Hispanics are like,  oh,  all that stuff.  They really believe that.  We have nothing better  to do but hate each other  because we were here.  There was nothing better  to do. 
[00:59:00]  But when we have a focal  point of hatred.  But when we can all  hate somebody,  isn't it beautiful?  Isn't that great?  Isn't it beautiful  how the Mexican guys  are like,  don't worry,  I'm going to help  cross the border.  Everybody's willing  to give their part.  You know what I mean?  This country is great  when we can come together  in hatred.  Exactly.  That's amazing.  I'm like,  the beaner will stab them,  the black guy will shoot them,  and the white guy will eat them.  Do we have a better army?  We can do drive-bys,  fly-bys.  We can cross borders  with these wetbacks.  You know,  we have everything, man.  It's awesome.  I was watching something 
[00:59:30]  on one of the Discovery channels  on small squads  of these special forces,  and there were black guys  in there with these  backwards Mississippi guys,  and Tennessee guys,  California surfer dudes,  New York ghetto dudes,  and they're all,  I mean,  watching each other's ass.  They would jump in front.  The guy from Tennessee  would jump in front  of the black guy  from Compton  and take a bullet  for this guy,  and they all come together,  but you finally realize  what they're coming together for 
[01:00:00]  to kill other people.  Yes.  And it's beautiful.  Isn't it awesome?  Well,  I can't believe  that anybody would attack us.  We can't come together  in anything else.  But that's because  we don't have to.  Right.  You know what I mean?  And it should be that way.  Because it's crap.  Like, you know,  before they would always say,  well,  what are you,  Honduran-American  or Mexican-American?  I'm like,  my mom's half,  my dad,  but I'm not any of that.  And they're like,  no,  you're half and half.  And I'm like,  I'm not a half-American, dude.  Right, right.  On April 15th,  the government seems  to take all my crap. 
[01:00:30]  I never got an  hora-le-pues rebate.  I never got that.  You know what I mean?  My African-American brothers  out there,  you never got a  yo-mofo,  we sorry,  you never got that.  You never got a,  you know what I'm saying?  It's like,  come on,  cut it, man.  Right, right.  I just can't believe,  like,  the kids today.  That's what I can't believe.  The kids that are like,  we're not like that, man.  Gotta be nice, you know.  We gotta talk  and be cool  and you know,  that's not,  and I'm like,  did you not read  your history book?  Do you not understand  the country that we are? 
[01:01:00]  A long time ago,  there were a couple  of guys in England  that had this great idea  but nowhere to exercise it  and one of them said,  let's go to America.  Yeah.  And the other guy said,  but there's people  already there  and he's like,  fine,  let's kill them  and call it Thanksgiving.  That's how it started, man.  That's how this country started.  Then we killed the Indians,  we killed the buffalo  and then we said,  it's too much work  for a white man.  Get some black people,  they'll do it for free.  Then when the black people said,  I ain't picking no more,  Julio,  get over here.  It's a party, man. 
[01:01:30]  We don't care.  That's why there's words  like Mick  and WAP  and Polak  because we don't care.  You just got here.  Scrub my toilet,  bastard.  We don't care.  But I'm white.  You're going to be brown  after you scrub my crap.  Get in there.  I don't care.  We're great.  I can't believe  that people didn't think  we would bomb the hell  out of anybody.  I know, right?  We're the first people  to invent.  We'll kill each other.  We don't have a problem  killing each other.  That's how crazy we are. 
[01:02:00]  Between wars,  we kill each other  and we hate each other.  But then when we get  a focal point,  someone else to hate,  we can rally  and be so innovative  in the ways  we kill people  and invent things  that could kill  so many people.  It's a beautiful thing.  The atomic weapon, man.  We were the only country  that ever used it.  Right.  And we had two at the time  and we used two.  We blew the wad.  It's great, isn't it?  You know that conversation.  How many do we have?  Two.  How many do we send?  Two, stupid. 
[01:02:30]  And you know  we were building another one  just in case  they didn't wave  that white flag.  Why do you think  every other country  in the Middle East  is helping us?  Because they know  how crazy we are.  They know.  Look, we were English  at first  and then as soon as  we got enough people  to kick their ass.  It was like there was  a guy with a clicker  going,  almost, almost.  It's time.  Here's your tea,  you English bastards.  You know,  it was like,  we're crazy, man.  We'll kill anybody  because we got the freedom. 
[01:03:00]  We know it.  You know what I mean?  We'll get rid of everybody.  This whole country  has been based  on that whole concept.  It's been brought up  that way.  The whole country  is raised that way.  We're a young country  and we're still  full of cowboys  and nuts  that you don't  F with.  You just don't  F with it.  Well, you got people  in this country  that want guns  because, you know,  in their eyes,  if the government  does something wrong,  damn it,  I won't be prepared.  You know what I'm saying?  Look what happened  with England.  Think about that mentality, man. 
[01:03:30]  Think about the mentality  behind that.  We have nuclear weapons,  we have, you know,  lasers, infrared,  all this stuff,  but Bubba  ain't getting rid  of a shotgun.  Do you understand  the kind of mentality,  the kind of retarded  thing,  the kind of goofy-ass moron  that's actually sitting  at home going,  my M14's going to make  a difference,  goddammit.  This is the kind  of people we have, man.  We're crazy.  Like, go to the internet,  right,  and on September 10th,  you will see  that people in Afghanistan,  everybody in the Middle East, 
[01:04:00]  let's say Iran,  for example,  talking smack,  hated America.  We hate you,  we hope you die  in pool of blood,  die you son of bitch,  die.  11th comes around,  president says  we will find them,  we will get them,  anybody that helped them,  anybody that houses them,  everybody.  Like a minute later,  Iran calls us,  what can we do  to help you,  my friends?  Well, yesterday,  we were talking smack,  it was bull, man,  come on,  we were trying to be funny.  You know what I'm saying?  That's the whole thing  that we're doing now 
[01:04:30]  is look at Afghanistan,  look at what we've done  to that whatever Taliban  government they had there  in the first place,  but it kind of says,  all right,  look,  we think this guy here,  Osama,  is being supported  by this government  in this country,  and look at what we're doing.  Right.  So who is going to be  the next nut country  to go,  all right,  Osama,  come here,  you're welcome  to come here.  But that's what  you're supposed to do,  that's like when  you smack your kids,  you know,  nobody wants to smack  their kids,  but you know  that when you smack them,  they do what they're told,  that's what we're doing. 
[01:05:00]  We're smacking the kids.  We're smacking the kids,  so that next time  when this knucklehead,  some idiot  who doesn't know better  goes,  how about we blow up  something in America,  there are other ones  who are like,  sit down,  I have a video  for you,  my friend.  Remember my cousin,  they are here  no longer,  okay?  There is a reason,  they are crazy bastards,  they kill themselves,  you know?  That's what we're doing,  man,  I don't have a problem  with it.  I have a problem  with like it's going  like too far  the other way,  like people are all scared, 
[01:05:30]  you know?  Carlos,  you doing jokes  about September?  Oh yeah,  yeah.  Yeah,  bro.  Oh no,  you shouldn't.  Why not?  Well,  you know,  because I mean,  it's not cool.  I don't care,  dude.  I don't care.  I don't hate  everybody that's Middle Eastern,  but any towelhead  that was involved,  I don't like you.  I don't like you  and if I find out  it's you,  I'm going to wipe  my ass  with your towelhead,  but only if you're involved.  So don't be calling in  and saying,  was he talking to me?  Because if you got to ask,  then we got to find out.  Yeah,  we got a bunch of flack  somebody recently called 
[01:06:00]  because I said,  and those goddamn towelheads  that did this  are going to pay.  And the guy's going,  hey,  look,  I wear a turban  and I don't like being  called a towelhead.  I go,  I didn't call you a towelhead.  Right.  I called the terrorist  who I see on TV  wearing towels on their heads.  Towelheads.  Right.  I'm not saying  all towelheads are terrorists.  I'm saying all the terrorists  are towelheads.  Right.  You know,  that guy didn't seem to understand.  He said he had lost  two friends  at the World Trade Center  and then he got mad  when I said,  were they flying the plane? 
[01:06:30]  He got very upset at that.  I can understand that.  But you're trying to be funny  and there's nothing wrong with that.  By the way,  they sent a letter to the boss.  Did they?  Did they really?  Yeah.  Who's they?  The Sikhs.  Oh,  the Sikhs?  Well,  I'll say this,  man.  You know,  if you meet people  that are Middle Eastern  or wearing,  you know,  turbans on their heads  and they're like pissed off,  those are real Americans.  All right?  Pissed off Middle Eastern people  and people with,  you know,  the turbans  are real Americans  because they're the kind of people 
[01:07:00]  that,  you know,  they put on the turban  after September 11th  and their whole family was like,  don't do it,  honey.  I know.  You know what I mean?  Look at what they're doing CNN.  Don't do it.  Don't do it.  And he was like,  you know,  I don't care.  I am in America  because I want to be  in the land of the free.  You can kiss my ass.  I will wear the turban  if you don't like it.  And,  you know,  and that's a real American.  I didn't see many turbans.  Right.  There were a lot of guys  driving around.  But the guys that did,  the guys that do it,  they got balls.  I respect,  I respect them.  See,  I'm not worried about those guys. 
[01:07:30]  I'm worried about the nice guy.  Well,  if you look at the clips  of the guys that did this,  they weren't wearing turbans.  They were well shaved  and well kept.  Right.  The guys that wear the turbans,  though,  I haven't seen a lot of them.  The cab drivers now,  they all got that turban hair.  Like,  you're not wearing it,  but you can see they have it.  But they have a little swirly top.  And I swear to God,  they are driving their cabs,  looking through a six by six hole  in their windshield  with all the American flag stickers  on every piece of glass  on their cab.  Flags flying from the trunks.  That's awesome.  God bless America. 
[01:08:00]  That's the way it should be, though.  Oh, yeah.  But it's happening here.  It's not happening on the West Coast.  On the West Coast,  you know,  they're dressing the same  and pissed off  that we look at them funny.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Why are you looking at me like that?  Because I saw somebody  that looks a lot like you  blow up some buildings.  That's why.  You know?  And I think that whole flag thing  is the right idea.  That's what I say.  If I was Middle Eastern,  I would wear a turban,  but I'd have a turban on the,  I mean, you know,  with a flag on the side of my turban.  I'd be walking around 
[01:08:30]  with flags coming out of my ass.  That's what I would be doing.  Walking down the street  singing Yankee Doodle Dandy.  That's what I would be doing.  You know?  But, dude,  people expect a lot from us.  And, you know,  it's like you can't say that anymore.  And that's not right.  And that's not fair.  And, you know,  poor people.  And it's like,  Middle Eastern people,  it sucks.  But you know what?  What is it?  The 11th,  it's been two months  since you guys have been  racially profiled.  You know,  me and the brothers  got racially profiled for years.  So, you know,  until you've done it for, 
[01:09:00]  you know,  until it's about 2020,  start bitching.  For now,  just handle it, babe.  That's what I say.  And how long  until we get people  from the Taliban  and Afghanis  just snapping pictures  at Disney World  and whatnot?  If you remember,  the two bombs we did drop  were on Japan.  And now,  one of our closest allies,  Germany,  helping us out.  Remember when they were  goose-stepping their way  across Europe  and we were  bombing the hell out of them?  So you never know  what's going to happen  in 20, 30, 40 years. 
[01:09:30]  We're spanking our kids.  Right.  They could be our bestest pals  as we wage war  against those  bastard Australians.  You know what I mean?  You never know.  This world is very fluid  and you don't know  who we're going to hate next.  Hey,  Anthony's driving  through PAs  from Alabama.  Anthony.  What's up?  What's up, man?  We're hanging  with Carlos Mencia.  Yeah,  you guys are awesome, man.  It's so great  to have a folk  a lot of people  that hate  from Alabama, man.  It's killer, man.  Well,  it's got to suck for you 
[01:10:00]  because people are  starting to mix so much  like, you know,  Hispanics and blacks  are having sex  and Asians.  It gets to the point  where if you're racist,  you just look at somebody  and go,  what the hell  do I call you, man?  What the hell  are you a nigger?  What the hell?  A chink?  Ah, man,  this is wrong.  A ninkerickan.  We don't know  what to do  with ourselves  down here.  A ninkerickan.  Ninkerickan.  Anthony,  what'd you say?  We don't know  what to do  with ourselves  down here, man. 
[01:10:30]  That's killer, man.  All right, bro.  I just want to tell y'all,  hell yeah, dude,  y'all got a whoop tail show.  Thank you.  Thank you, Bama.  All right,  take it easy.  First time listener  is driving through PA  from Alabama.  A whoop tail show.  We better take a break.  Carl Smith is only here  for a few more minutes.  That sucks.  Having fun, man.  He's playing Rascals  tonight in Ocean Township.  That's why he's got  to get on the road  and get way down there.  And then tomorrow night  he's playing Rascals  in West Orange.  He's really,  really funny, man.  As you can tell  by just listening  on the radio.  You'll love it.  More with Carlos.  Stay there.  We're back with the 
[01:11:00]  Opie and Anthony show.  We're hanging with  Carlos Mencia.  He's playing Rascals  Comedy Club tonight  in Ocean Township  and tomorrow night  at Rascals  in West Orange.  A very,  very funny guy.  We love when he  comes on our program.  Oh, yeah.  It's been a long time,  Carlos.  I know.  I was supposed to call  and, man, 
[01:11:30]  I've been,  dude,  I've been so busy, man.  That's right.  Like, this last year  is just...  You were supposed  to come to town  right around September 11th.  We were all getting  excited to have you in.  I was going to fly  out on the 11th.  Really?  Yeah, so...  Then all our lives  changed.  Well, you know  what's funny?  I could not imagine  that there was a point  like when something  happened and my mind  thought, oh,  I could talk about that  later on.  And then part of my mind  was like,  dude,  that's disgusting  that you're actually  thinking of writing  a joke right now. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah, we had a rough  time, man,  with our radio show  for a while.  We were a little weird.  It really just  effed us up bad.  I could imagine  never...  I never wanted  to tell a joke again  after that.  Right.  And then,  like on Saturday,  I went to a comedy club.  Two days later?  No, no,  it was like Tuesday  to Saturday, right?  Oh, okay, okay.  So then on Saturday,  but here's what happened.  Saturday,  I went to the comedy club  and the comedian,  every comedian would  like not make a joke  but mention something  about something.  Just like to say, 
[01:12:30]  all right,  I know what happened  but now I want  to do my stuff.  And any time they  would say something  about the 11th,  especially if it was  funny,  the crowd just went  nuts.  But then when they  started going back  to I broke up  with my girlfriend,  it was like,  they laughed  but it was like,  eh.  And I could tell  that the audience  was like,  you know,  we need to laugh  at this stuff.  We need somebody  to talk about it.  You can't ignore it.  You know what I mean?  Just vent,  blow off some steam  about it.  And that's when  I felt needed.  You know what I mean?  Because I know  that I'm stupid enough 
[01:13:00]  and I grew up  broke enough,  you know what I mean,  that I don't really care.  Like all you can do  is not come to my shows  and then I'm not  going to make money  and I already grew up  without money  so, you know,  I still like Top Ramen  so, you know what I mean?  I'm serious, man.  So I'm like,  for me it's like,  I'm par.  In life,  I can't be anything  but par  because I was already broke.  So, you know,  I'm just like,  that's when I was like,  I got to talk about this stuff.  How was the flight to New York?  Coming here?  Yeah.  First time you've flown or?  You know what?  You know what it was?  First of all,  I try to fly Southwest  as much as possible now 
[01:13:30]  because I don't think  that anybody's ever  going to hijack that airline.  That's true.  But not because it sucks.  I'll tell you what,  all right?  The people that fly Southwest  are ghetto,  trailer trash,  you know,  Dominican,  you know what I mean?  Yeah.  You get the worst.  These people are wretched, man.  You know what I mean?  They saved years  to afford a ticket  on Southwest.  You know what I'm saying?  So,  here's the difference  between this airline 
[01:14:00]  and any other airline,  all right?  Recently,  I think it was on American,  there was some crazy guy  that said he was going  to open the cockpit door.  Yeah.  And then the plane landed.  Do you guys remember  the incident?  The passengers subdued him  and they arrested him.  Well,  I don't know if you recall  about two years ago  on Southwest.  And this was way  before paranoia,  way before,  this was just normal American,  everything's happening great,  some crazy ass  did the same thing.  And the difference was  when the plane landed,  he was dead.  That's the difference.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:14:30]  That was the guy  that put the foot  on his throat  and choked him out.  They killed his ass.  So that's why terrorists  would never hijack  that airline.  Because these guys  killed their own.  I mean,  think about that, man.  They killed one  of their own guys.  They killed one,  and this was like  during happy times,  you know what I'm saying?  This wasn't during  any, like, craziness.  I could just imagine,  you know,  the plane landing  and, you know,  the FAA  and the guards running in  and what happened  and some guy going,  I don't know,  he treat  and he no breathe no more.  Well,  the phone's going nuts here. 
[01:15:00]  Let's go to a couple here.  No, breathe no more.  Ed,  we're hanging with  Carl Smith here.  What do you got, Ed?  Hey, what's up, boys?  What's up, Carlos?  What's up, Ed?  I just wanted to say,  them coming over here,  it's like two brothers fighting,  and when you try to break them up,  they turn around  and kick your ass.  Yeah, that's the American way, man.  If you try to step in  between brothers fighting,  and Irish brothers  are notorious for this.  You're in a bar  and two Irish brothers  start beating the crap  out of each other,  you just stand back  and watch them.  Because if you step in  and try to break it up, 
[01:15:30]  they will both turn around  and beat the crap out of you.  And that's it,  and it will always happen that way.  Don't say anything bad about it.  They will badmouth each other,  smack each other in the face  all night  until they're drunk enough  until they start rumbling.  But if you say one thing bad  about either of them,  they will both kick your ass.  Right.  And that's pretty much  what this country's all about.  We'll beat the crap out of each other  all the time  until it comes time to  turn around.  But that's the way it is  when you have a girlfriend  or a wife.  Yeah.  Right? 
[01:16:00]  And you're talking smack  about one of your brothers.  You know,  and you're like,  man,  he's a loser,  blah, blah, blah.  And she's just agreeing with you  and everything's cool.  And then she's stupid enough  to say it.  And you know what else he is?  Oh, yeah.  And then you're like,  bitch,  what did you say about my brother?  What's up?  Whore?  Who are you to talk about  my family,  you whore?  You're just boning me  because I'm a comedian,  you stupid ass.  So don't talk smack  about my brother.  All right?  He loves me.  He'd go to jail for me.  You just want to give me  hummers because I hook you up 
[01:16:30]  with jewelry.  So shut your ass up.  But you were saying.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, but he's my brother.  I just thought.  Well, because it's deep,  you know what I'm saying?  Because, you know,  because then they try to,  well, but I'm trying  to protect you.  But, bitch,  no, you're not trying to.  He's the one that took me  to the hospital  four miles,  dragging me  when my leg was broken.  Where were you, bitch?  Huh?  Where were you?  How did that happen?  You didn't care.  So shut up.  As soon as you divorce me,  how much are you going to take?  Half.  He just wants 500 bucks. 
[01:17:00]  It's not even half.  Let me talk smack.  I'm going to give it to him.  I just want to be pissed,  for Christ's sake.  You nailed that one.  You know?  So and so.  Very good.  Eric, what's going on?  Yeah, how you doing?  All right.  Carlos was talking  about all the flag waving  going on?  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, this is the first time  that I know of  that you can drive  through Harlem,  the South Bronx,  wherever,  and you see more American flags  than Puerto Rican flags  and Dominican flags.  It's the first time.  Oh, yeah.  It's beautiful, isn't it?  Yeah, it's great. 
[01:17:30]  It's great.  Finally, people recognize  where they live.  We've talked about  the flag on our show  and they just don't know  how to keep them  on their cars, though.  Yeah, people want  to be all patriotic  and they send away.  Put them on the windows  and stuff?  They put them on the windows  outside the car.  They're all flying.  And then like a week  after the 11th,  I'm looking on the side  of the BQE  and there's just American flags  in the gutter  laying there.  Because they're flying  off the cars.  It just slaps off  into the gutter somewhere.  I'm patriotic. 
[01:18:00]  Well, there it goes.  There's some duct tape.  Yeah, how about  securing it to your vehicle?  Instead of the scotch tape.  Jimmy, what's up?  Jimmy, you're next.  What's going on?  Listen, I wanted you  to tell Carlos.  Yes.  I was stationed out  in Honduras.  Where?  What city?  I was in,  I went into Pomerola  then I was up north  by Camp Big Bear.  Okay.  Back in 1986.  Right.  I just want you to know,  I was there protecting  Honduran people.  Right.  And giving them food.  Right.  And yet they threw  rocks at my vehicles  when we drove by  to protect them.  That's why I'm here, bro.  What I'm saying is  anybody that's not  born in America 
[01:18:30]  is not American.  Those people who are  Honduran now  in this country  mostly lived in Honduras  and came to America.  Yeah, but you know what?  Most people that come  to America  come to America  because they know  it's a better place.  But they still have  those feelings  deep down inside of them.  Like the Arabs  that we're talking about,  the ones born here  are the ones that are okay.  The ones that come here  from Saudi Arabia  or Yemen  or whatever the hell  you want to talk about,  those are the ones  that I worry about,  not the ones  that are born here  in America.  No, see,  I think you're mistaken.  I think that people  that are born in America 
[01:19:00]  are normally complacent,  lazy,  take it for granted.  Dude,  it's the immigrants  that come here,  wherever they come from.  You know,  not the ones,  of course,  that are terrorists  and want to kill us.  But it's the immigrants  that work hard.  in Honduras  who I was protecting  against with aggression  from other states  around them.  Because they're stupid.  And yet they're still  throwing rocks  at my vehicle  while I'm driving by  trying to protect them.  Those guys were idiots.  Aren't those the ones  immigrating to our country?  Just because I was born?  No,  those aren't the ones  immigrating here.  The ones immigrating here.  I've seen the life 
[01:19:30]  in Honduras, man.  I believe that.  Yeah, I know.  Let me tell you  who's coming here.  People that live  in other countries  and they go,  this place sucks.  I work my ass off.  I'm smart.  And I don't get jack.  Those are the people  that come here.  Like, for example,  I don't care where  in America you go.  You know who cleans  rooms in hotels?  Immigrants that came  from El Salvador,  Mexico.  Immigrants here  that are here illegal.  People that can't read  do not disturb.  I know that.  Yeah, exactly.  Sons of bitches.  But that's my point.  But you can't blame them. 
[01:20:00]  We're not there  to protect your country  from aggression.  No, no, wait a minute.  Wait a minute, dude.  And there's still  rocks at my vehicle.  This is my country.  Just so, you know, bro,  just because I was born there  doesn't mean it's my country.  All right?  That's, if,  basically,  I'm talking to you  from New York,  not Tegucigalpa.  So I'm from here, bro.  Three months old  you were when you left?  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, it really affected you.  And I got to fight  with this guy.  You see what I'm saying?  My parents  putting things 
[01:20:30]  into your brain  about Americans over there.  Dude,  my parents told me  that America kicks ass.  That this is the only place.  You're the exception,  not the rule.  No, I'm telling you,  I am not the exception.  Most immigrants  have badass  attitudes about America.  Correct.  Right.  And yet,  we're there protecting them.  And then we let them  come to our country  to make more money  in one year  than they can make  in a lifetime.  Right, so.  All right, Jimmy,  you made your point.  Thank you.  Okay, 80 second airborne.  Oh, help, help.  All right, thank you.  There he goes, Jimmy. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, he jumps out of planes?  Yeah, there you go.  You should have told me  that up front.  I wouldn't argue  with the dumb guy.  Let's see what Tom has.  Tom,  what do you have  for Carlos Mencia?  Yo, what's up, man?  Yo, Carlos.  Yes.  It's funny now,  you know,  you watch the Mexicans  still come across the border  and they're trying  to control it.  Right.  Now, when you see  the Mexicans coming,  because you're like,  well, at least you know  that they're Christian  and they're blown up and up  and they're on our side almost.  Right.  But you're still  because the Arabs  are coming across the border. 
[01:21:30]  Right.  Well, he's not.  What do you think?  No, I hear you, man.  Well, here's what I say,  you know, to America.  You were stopping,  you were stopping  the wrong brown people  from coming in the country.  That's all I'm saying.  You were worried  about the wrong brown people.  That's all I'm saying.  You know what they're doing now?  They're actually questioning  the people that are coming over  from Mexico,  illegal immigrants,  you know,  crossing the river  and whatnot,  about if they've seen anything.  Well, yeah.  Have you seen anything?  Have you seen any  Middle Eastern people? 
[01:22:00]  They're using them now  to keep an eye on the border.  But could you imagine  if you were an illegal immigrant,  right,  that's coming to this country,  because we have the technology  to stop illegal immigration.  We just don't  because there's jobs  that we don't want to do  that they need to do.  I mean,  let's just be honest.  I don't want to pick lettuce.  Exactly.  I mean,  you can get the redneck  trailer trash of the world  and say,  you want to pick fruit?  Hell no,  I'd rather live in my trailer park  and watch Rikki Lake,  you dumbass.  I mean,  come on,  they're here for a reason.  But if I was an illegal,  I'd be pissed  because I'd be like, 
[01:22:30]  why,  I would be like,  why are you stopping me  from coming in?  I paint your whole house  for $32.  Why are you stopping me?  I never blow anything up.  I never,  okay,  one time,  but I told him  I'm not an electrician,  but I never.  You don't have a problem  finding me.  I'm in front of Home Depot.  Yeah,  yeah.  But where is Ahmed,  huh?  He's at Radio Chat.  That's who you'll be looking for.  I would be so pissed, 
[01:23:00]  man,  if I was like an illegal immigrant  because,  you know,  why are we stopping these guys?  Why are they even  giving them a hassle?  I mean,  I understand the fence.  That's great  because we only want  the good ones.  You know what I'm saying?  It's hard to filter it out,  the good ones.  Well,  you got to filter.  That's why you got to  put a river in the way  and,  you know,  you don't want the guy  with cerebral palsy  crossing,  of course.  That's just a burden.  Exactly.  You know,  you don't want the guy,  oh,  man,  there's a fence.  You got to go back,  Julio.  Sorry,  you know.  You want the ones  that are like,  wait until it's dark  and we can jump over.  That's the guy you want. 
[01:23:30]  Physically fit.  Exactly.  But I would,  it would be,  man,  because it's,  you know,  it's like,  poor guys,  man,  getting caught  three,  four times,  right,  getting sent back  to Mexico  just so they can  come and pick fruit  and make $2.05 an hour.  Well,  you know,  these Middle Eastern  terrorist guys  are coming in  with passports.  As students,  they're fighting.  Yes,  my friend,  I am going to school.  My name is Bob.  Come on,  dude.  That's a fake passport,  man.  I'm taking flight training 
[01:24:00]  and I don't want to learn  the takeoff and landing part.  I just need a turn.  Yeah,  exactly.  I just need the flying part.  Yeah,  exactly.  Can you imagine that?  That's amazing.  Jimmy,  what's up?  Oh,  hey,  this guy called us.  I saw his HBO special.  Yeah.  Let me tell you something  one night,  last week,  and he does this bit  about the L.A. riots  where he takes a stocking,  puts it over his head  and then pulls the back  and makes some stuff  look like he's Korean  or something.  I pissed myself.  And the Jeffrey Dahmer bit. 
[01:24:30]  Like,  when they raided his house,  they didn't find no penises.  Well,  they didn't.  He does a whole bit.  He says,  you know,  we're stuck in the mountains  and I'm going to eat you  but I'm going to leave you a penis.  This guy is the best.  All right,  Jimmy,  thank you.  Well,  that was real.  That was real,  though.  When they raided Dahmer's house,  they found heads,  arms,  limbs.  Yeah.  They found no testicles  or penises.  Yeah,  and I'm just like,  all right,  I can understand  eating somebody  but Jesus, 
[01:25:00]  man.  Pick your parts.  No.  You don't do that,  man.  That's wrong.  And so,  and so I was thinking about it  because a long time ago,  they made a movie about it  called,  I think,  Survivor or something  where these Argentinian kids.  Oh,  yeah,  yeah,  the soccer team  that went down the Andes.  They ate each other?  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  You know what I mean?  Look,  don't get me wrong.  I'm not going to tell you  that I would never eat somebody  because I would.  If I had to eat somebody  and I'm in the middle of nowhere 
[01:25:30]  and you died,  I would eat you.  But if it inevitably came down to it,  they would find me dead  like next time.  You know what I mean?  Yeah,  but sometimes you just don't eat.  Well,  because I would hate,  you know,  I would hate,  I would hate to be like,  thinking,  should I,  shouldn't I,  maybe,  and then,  you know,  with my luck,  as the helicopter's coming in,  I'm taking a bite.  You know what I'm saying?  And that would be my luck,  you know what I mean?  I thought you weren't going to show up,  I swear to God. 
[01:26:00]  Oh my God,  he's eating the penis,  he's eating the penis.  Oh,  that's classic.  Those are,  those are,  those are classic jokes,  man,  I forgot about those.  I write so much stuff,  man,  I forget about that stuff.  Is there anybody else  interesting on the lines?  Yeah,  I'm trying to figure out.  Yeah,  we're weeding,  throwing them here.  Something I got dumped out of,  I'm sure,  but,  oh well.  Neil,  what's up?  Neil.  Hey.  Speak.  Neil.  Hello. 
[01:26:30]  Hey.  Oh.  A guy that's going to slow down the show.  What's up,  Neil?  Neil.  It's Leo.  Leo,  whatever.  What's up,  Leo?  Leo.  Okay,  I'm a 17-year-old kid.  Yes.  I'm an aspiring comedian,  and a comedian like Carlos  makes me want to more big comedians.  Well,  first of all,  I don't smoke pot,  and I don't drink,  so that's one thing you've got to change  right off the bat.  You've got to lay off the pot.  Are you assuming that he is?  Assuming?  Come on,  man.  I don't smoke pot,  I drink. 
[01:27:00]  Whatever kind of high substance you're on,  you've got to get off it,  man,  is what I'm saying.  You're 17 right now,  dude.  Your brain should be firing on all cylinders.  You should be thinking of all kinds of great stuff to say.  You know,  when you call Opie and Anthony,  you shouldn't,  when they say,  hey,  Neil,  or what,  you shouldn't be,  uh,  my name is Leo,  not me.  Well,  you knew we were talking to you.  You heard us talking to you over your phone.  Um,  I've been on the radio before,  too.  I've done comedy on the radio. 
[01:27:30]  All right,  thanks.  Ah,  there we go.  That's great.  I've got to tell you,  you're going to make a great comedian.  Oh,  thanks.  I can see it.  You've got some talent there.  You've got some chops to you.  Thank you.  Good luck.  Yeah,  thanks.  All right.  All right.  Oh,  my God.  Dude,  that was anti-lock brake system right there,  man.  That dude.  Oh,  that was bad.  Johnny,  what's going on?  Help us out here.  Yo,  what's up,  fellas?  Last dude,  Leo,  can make an onion cry,  man.  Yeah.  Hey,  um,  I was in Washington,  D.C.  at a trade show, 
[01:28:00]  right?  And that town is like really dead.  And we had a,  uh,  an Indian cab driver.  He had a haircut like Mr.  Softy.  You mean the,  uh,  swirly ice cream on his head type of hair?  Oh,  yeah.  Those guys used to wear the turbans,  but,  uh,  I think this guy,  uh,  took a beat in big time.  I think.  Especially down there.  I think they screw him on.  Because the way the hair looks,  it looks like they screw it on.  It doesn't look like you can wear a turban your whole life and then just take it off.  Right.  You know,  there's probably,  your hair has to be retrained,  uh, 
[01:28:30]  to not have the turban on it anymore.  Let's go to Cleveland.  Nick,  what's going on,  bud?  Hey,  not a lot,  guys.  What's happening?  Uh,  help us out.  What do you got for Carlos?  Yeah,  I was going to ask Carlos.  Yes.  What,  does he have a website or where can we get some of his material,  man?  Oh,  yeah.  Go to,  the killer.  Go to Carlos,  C-A-R-L-O-S,  Mencia,  M-E-N-C-I-A dot com.  And,  uh,  actually,  I appreciate it.  Get the,  I know you guys have the best show in Ohio.  I swear to God.  Thank you,  man.  I'm thanking it.  Hands down,  hands down.  After the winter,  we're going to make a trip to, 
[01:29:00]  uh,  Cleveland,  so.  Hey,  the women here are crazy,  man.  You guys,  New York is just a bad time right now.  All right,  we'll get,  we'll get to Cleveland.  I promise.  Okay,  great.  Thanks a lot.  Thanks,  Nick.  Yeah,  you should explain people what you do on your website.  You do,  uh,  put a lot of new material up there.  Yeah.  You're always making CDs and.  I,  like all,  I write new stuff all the time and I,  and I,  uh,  I did something after September 11th because I, 
[01:29:30]  you know what?  I couldn't pretend to talk about something else because it wasn't important to me.  So I just wrote,  you know,  a whole new one hour and something act.  And I was all about,  and after September 11th.  So that's called America rules.  You can get that on carlosmencia.com.  All right,  Nick,  what's going on?  We only have a few minutes left with Carlos.  No problem.  What's up guys.  Hey,  Carlos.  What's up,  bro.  I listened to you the last time you were at,  you were on ONA.  Right.  And,  uh,  you did a bit about your father being a broker for a bunch of Mexican wetbacks that were looking for work. 
[01:30:00]  Pretty much.  I was wondering if you could do that bit again.  It was hilarious.  I'm trying to remember that one.  Oh,  you're saying like your father was a broker and they don't know where to go.  Right.  Well,  it's cause it's cause some guy came up to my dad basically at,  you know,  and my dad at the time was,  you know,  was like an engineer and he was a pilot and all this stuff.  And he said,  you know,  you pay my house.  And I thought my dad was going to get offended.  Like,  Hey man,  you know,  do you know what you're talking to?  But he didn't.  He said,  you know,  how much?  And the guy's like 50 bucks. 
[01:30:30]  So my dad goes over there where all the illegals were hanging out.  And he goes,  you know,  six of you,  I'll give you $5 each.  If you paint a house.  So he's like,  they're like,  okay.  So he gives them five bucks each.  And then he goes up to the guy and he takes the 50 bucks.  So he made 20 bucks off the transaction.  And I was like,  dad,  you just cheated him out of money.  And he was like,  no,  that's business.  I'm a broker.  He needed,  he didn't know how to talk to them.  So I communicate with them and I get my feet.  So I think I'll defeat.  And that's like,  that's,  that's a part of me that he's just a funny guy, 
[01:31:00]  man.  He's,  he's like,  he's my comedic influence.  He's the guy that just,  you know what I mean?  Balls out,  funny,  doesn't care.  He's just real,  man.  He's real.  I have 18 brothers and sisters.  I was going to say,  I was going to say,  I was going to say,  don't you have 13,  but it's 18.  I have 11 sisters and six brothers.  All right.  This is a true story.  So I said,  Holy Jesus.  I said,  it comes up in one of my economic classes.  And my,  my teacher's like,  oh,  so where's your family from?  I go,  my mom's Mexican.  My dad's from Honduras.  She goes,  oh,  I want you to do a report on why your family had so much kids and the relationship to the fact that where they come from, 
[01:31:30]  there's no social security.  I was like,  oh,  okay,  that's cool.  So I tell my dad,  you know,  I'm going to do this thing,  blah,  blah,  blah,  no social security.  I want to find out,  you know,  because basically you want us to take care of you and I need to do a report about it.  So you need to tell me,  you know what I mean?  Why you had so many kids.  And,  and my dad goes,  why are you getting,  I know,  I know,  but I had to say what he said.  That's what he said.  Your mom.  Your mom doesn't like the oral treats. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah.  And so,  and so I'm looking at him and I'm like,  whoa,  dad,  well,  what's up with that?  Yeah.  And then he said,  put it in the report.  So I go,  no,  I'm not going to put it in the report.  And he goes,  no,  you're going to put it in the report.  I'm going to read it.  If it's not in there,  I'm going to rip it.  And you're going to write a new one and you're going to put it in the report.  And I'm like,  why do you want me to put that in the report?  I swear to God,  this is my dad,  because I know you're going to read it in class.  People are going to hear it.  They're going to talk about it.  Your mom is going to hear about it.  And then maybe she's going to do it. 
[01:32:30]  I swear to God.  Still trying to broker.  He's awesome,  man.  He's a great guy.  I love the time for one more call.  Chris,  what's up?  Hey,  what's going on guys?  Hey,  I just wanted to tell Carlos,  man.  He's so effing right about those Mexicans,  man.  Everybody's all blessed on them now with all this going on.  They got a place here too,  bro.  Well,  you know what?  It's basically,  look at it this way.  For all the people that don't understand immigration,  let me break it down to you.  America has the technology to stop illegal immigrants from coming in the country, 
[01:33:00]  but there are reasons.  There's a reason why you can go to Montgomery,  Alabama,  right?  Probably the whitest,  Southerst place you can go to.  And at nine o'clock in the morning,  you'll hear,  the housekeeping.  How the hell did somebody like that get to Montgomery?  You know why?  Because somebody told them there's a lot of work in Montgomery.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah,  man.  So,  so they're here for a reason,  but there's a lot of people that don't understand that.  So let me explain it to you.  You live in a country so technologically advanced that we've created an artificial heart. 
[01:33:30]  We've gone to the edge of our solar system.  We've created,  you know,  we,  we've created ways to cure cancer,  chemotherapy.  We have weapons that can destroy the inhabitants of the earth over 10,000 times over.  We have lasers,  satellites that can read a piece of paper on the ground.  We have all this amazing technology,  and you really believe we can't stop Julio from crossing the border.  You know what I'm saying?  Like,  what are they?  MacGyver wetbacks or something?  So what I'm saying is, 
[01:34:00]  you know,  they're here for a reason,  and just let them do their work.  And,  and,  you know,  that,  that,  that's about,  that's,  that's what that's all about.  So just let them do what they do.  You're keeping it real,  you're talking the truth.  It's the way it is.  And then,  and it's not because my name is Carlos.  If they happen to be,  you know,  chinks on a boat,  hey,  I need my shirt sewed,  and I don't want to pay 80 bucks for them either.  Right.  You know what I'm saying?  So girls need their nails done,  and you need your sushi,  and you might need a Yankee cranky with a happy ending.  Oh,  dude,  that's not a,  but she didn't have them,  and she,  she wasn't from there,  dude.  It was so,  did you see that,  the last episode where she didn't have the accent? 
[01:34:30]  No.  Yeah,  so in the,  one of the final episodes,  she's like,  starts laughing,  and she's like,  from Seattle.  The guy's like,  you're not Asian?  She's like,  no,  I'm from Seattle.  And she was like,  and this guy's calling us ignorant.  Jay,  what's up?  Hey,  what's up,  man?  I love you guys.  Just want to start off by saying that.  I've been listening to you since you knocked all those old rock jocks off the air here in New York.  Thank you,  Jay.  Oh,  yeah.  But I just want to say,  you guys suck ever since about September 15th.  You guys are really sympathetic. 
[01:35:00]  You're really,  you know,  you're open-minded,  a little equal opportunity,  but lately,  you just,  you know,  you're Indian bashing way too much.  Indian bashing?  Yeah.  Well,  American Indian,  American Indian,  or?  No,  no,  the Indian Indians,  the 7-Eleven guys you want to yoke up and kill for the trade center.  Who said that?  Dude,  nobody,  no.  Are you stupid?  You're going on the turban thing and this,  that,  and the other thing.  Yeah.  We're not even listening.  But we're talking Middle Eastern,  dude. 
[01:35:30]  We know Indians are our allies,  bro.  Yeah,  but the ignorant,  toothless,  white trash that your demographic doesn't know that.  Well,  you're listening,  Jay.  What's that?  You're listening.  I think I said,  wait a minute.  I'm misinterpreting you.  What do you think all these stupid passages?  Wait a minute.  There's no way our listeners could decipher this crap,  bro.  But I'm saying,  even the other day,  Anthony's talking about that lady that got sculled with one of the care packages.  Yeah.  I hate all of them.  Whether they're good or bad,  they're Afghani.  Over there in Afghanistan?  No,  mister,  let me,  let me,  let me actually explain something to you. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah,  explain it.  When I'm talking about our country being at war in another country,  I don't care if there's collateral damage over there.  There's no such thing as collateral damage.  You know what I mean?  It's a war.  It's supposed to be ugly and disgusting and kill people,  so somebody wants it to stop.  If it's nice,  it could go on for a while.  The more disgusting and putrid and the more of an abomination war is,  the shorter it will be.  So when innocent people are getting crushed by our care packages, 
[01:36:30]  I laugh at the irony of the whole thing, first of all.  Secondly,  I don't care that she died.  That's what I was saying.  I'm not saying go into a 7-Eleven and kill an Indian with a turban.  Did I ever say that,  Jay?  Well,  maybe I'm the ignorant,  toothless ass then.  You're being a little too sensitive.  All right,  and I'm a little defensive after what took place,  of course.  Well,  I love you guys anyway,  man.  Keep rocking.  All right,  Jay.  Well,  you never,  you never,  you never said,  you never said Indians,  dude.  No,  you know,  because you say,  you say that the towel heads that are responsible for, 
[01:37:00]  the terrorism.  Right.  And people go,  hey,  hey,  don't talk about the Indians.  What?  But the,  but the Indians,  the Indians are more pissed than we are,  like in India.  Yeah.  They're,  they're like,  they're the pacifist people and they're the ones that are having,  you know,  all these rallies over there saying that we're not doing enough.  Right,  right.  That's when,  you know,  it's,  it's crazy when the Hindu people talking about peace,  love,  and harmony.  We love everybody.  Eat and don't eat, 
[01:37:30]  don't eat.  And then maybe things will change.  And now they're like,  why are you not using nuclear weapons?  Yeah.  Why did you invent if you're not going to use them?  Drop them.  God damn it.  Do it now.  What about peace?  Peace of my ass.  Bull.  Drop the big one.  Come on.  God damn it.  You know,  it's like,  whoa,  dude.  I,  I was really pissed personally.  All right.  Because I was stupid enough to,  I made a mistake.  If there's ever a tragedy,  don't watch Spanish television news.  Okay.  I'm serious. 
[01:38:00]  Well,  I don't understand it.  Well,  because they,  they just,  they show everything,  dude.  Oh,  that I see.  On CNN and CNBC,  you know,  they show people jumping out of buildings one time.  And that was it informative.  And that was it.  I swear to God,  dude,  on Univision,  man,  I got so pissed because it was like,  they just kept showing it over and over.  Yeah,  that's right.  You know,  and they're like,  mira y la gente está jumping.  And they're showing people jumping out.  And then,  you know,  go and then,  Rogelio,  show it again.  And they just kept showing it to the point where I was like, 
[01:38:30]  pissed,  man.  You know,  you know what though?  I don't like seeing that either.  I hate singing it.  Right.  I don't,  I don't think it's right to show it,  but it's the,  it seems to be the only way to keep people focused on what we have to do to stop it from happening again.  I agree.  People forget.  They show the dead bodies over there in Afghanistan.  And people are like,  oh,  it's horrible what we're doing.  I saw people bringing children into an Afghani hospital because a bomb went awry and blew up a family or something. 
[01:39:00]  And people are like,  oh,  see that?  The horrible American army doing this.  Roll the film.  Do we have to roll tape on September 11th again?  This is,  this is the most politically correct bombing ever.  We bomb.  And then the next day we show where we bombed just to appease.  Right.  See,  that's a hospital.  Yeah,  exactly.  We didn't touch it,  but we touched it.  See over here,  see how there's nobody there in this round.  So we didn't get anybody.  And so we have to justify what we bombed.  Right.  We have to,  and we,  we,  I think it's cool though,  that we're dropping peanut butter in a place that has no water. 
[01:39:30]  I think that's right.  I think the irony of that is way cool,  man.  We got to cut you off because they're getting nervous.  We got to get you down to Rascals.  I got to go to Rascals.  Rascals tonight in Ocean Township.  It's a very long ride.  If you're in the area,  we,  I mean,  God,  I hope you've been listening.  We highly recommend you go see Carlos.  That's a given,  obviously.  If you can't make it tonight in Ocean Township,  he's playing the Rascals in West Orange tomorrow night.  All right.  All right.  Beautiful.  Carlos,  next time you got to stay longer.  Dude, 
[01:40:00]  I love it here,  man.  I didn't know I had to,  I was way out there.  That's all right.  That's all right.  And carlsmencia.com as well.  Okay?  Cool.  Dudes,  it's awesome,  man.  I love being on the show.  Peace.  Peace.  Are you bastards ready to rock?  Opie and Anthony.  And you actually find them rubbing the feces on the wall.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Psychotic apes.  Is this for shock factor?  Oh my God.  I want to thank Carlos Mencer for stopping by today. 
[01:40:30]  Yes.  He was right on today,  man.  Very thought provoking.  The guy from Boston hung up.  He thinks that they're playing Beatles music over our broadcast today.  What?  Don't be silly.  I want to talk to him,  but.  Stacey,  what's going on?  Hey,  Opie,  I just wanted to tell you I love your laugh.  It does something to me every time I hear it.  Uh-oh.  I'm glad Anthony is so hysterically funny because you just do it to me, 
[01:41:00]  baby.  Wow,  look at you.  Well,  thank you,  Stacey.  You're welcome.  Listen,  guys,  I want to know,  when are you coming to Washington?  You've been going on and on about how bad D.C. is,  and we don't listen,  and first you were coming down,  then you weren't coming down,  then you were burnt from all your other trips.  I need to see you guys bad.  We didn't say any of those things.  Yeah.  You said we were weak.  We're the listeners in D.C.  You said you were coming to see us a few weeks ago after you went to Boston.  Get rid of her?  Ben wants us to get rid of her. 
[01:41:30]  What?  Oh.  Aw.  She's a crazy lady.  Aw.  All right.  Who is she?  Some nutcase.  A kook from Washington?  That's great.  Well,  there you go.  She likes Opie.  Good.  Thank God the nuts always like you.  Go figure.  Another kook that likes me.  Speaking of kooks,  Stalker Patty's outside,  Anthony,  to help us out with mommy.  What would you do for Britney Spears?  Stick it?  Oh,  are we doing that today?  Well,  two mommies showed up.  Great. 
[01:42:00]  Thank you,  ladies who promised they would be here today.  You screwed us.  You screwed our show.  Twats.  We knew it.  You,  you women.  You bitches.  What do they?  You never show up for our goddamn contest.  What do they think?  I don't know.  If you're not going to show up,  you've got to tell us.  Yeah.  Ah,  happens every time.  They think it's all just for,  you know,  the radio.  Well,  I don't really have to do this.  They're just looking for outrageous stuff to make believe it's going to happen.  Yeah. 
[01:42:30]  What happened to the mom,  the mother of four,  that was going to have that lesbian thing with that mother of two?  Remember,  we were going to promote her website.  If she got on the lesbian couch with the mother of four,  and that was the mother of four's chances to win the chance to win the Britney Spears tickets?  Nothing.  Both don't show up.  Don't call.  Nothing.  We have a contest that involves guys.  They're down here in droves.  We've got to kick them out.  There's plenty of them.  And you women are always going,  Why don't you do a contest with women?  You don't do anything with more women.  Why are you less women with it? 
[01:43:00]  And then we put something together for you,  and you don't even show up.  You can only rely on strippers.  Right.  We can only rely on those big,  tan,  stinky strippers.  Marty, what's up?  No brain strippers.  What are you guys going to do to you?  Huh?  You're going to start the Britney Spears contest now?  Yeah.  Who are you?  Are you a female or a male?  Male.  How old are you?  Thirteen.  And you want to hear this today?  Yeah, why?  That voice didn't change yet, huh? 
[01:43:30]  That's a bitch.  Uh, she's only thirteen.  It happens.  Yeah, sometimes it happens around that age.  Your friend's voice is changing already, Marty?  Not really.  No?  See, they're all in the same boat now, man.  I think it's more of fourteen.  Yeah, nah, I don't know.  Thirteen sometimes.  We've had kids that call up and go,  Hi, I'm thirteen.  They're like, what?  Get out.  You got any whiskers yet, Marty?  Nope.  Nothing, huh?  Yeah, nothing.  Nothing sprouting anywhere?  Nothing yet.  Not really.  All right.  Well, we're going to start it now.  Oh, dear.  Yes, yes.  But we got some serious problems with this contest  because we just realized that one of the... 
[01:44:00]  Crinker, crinker, woo!  One of the mommies...  Yeah.  ...was going to put the wow bikini on?  Uh-huh.  Uh, look out the window, Anthony,  because she was going to walk around the streets of Manhattan.  Pitch black, raining.  That's great.  That's great.  That's just wonderful.  Uh...  It's the bitches that'll get you.  I don't know.  What's that problem, Ben?  I assume it's, uh, Westwood One. 
[01:44:30]  Huh?  There's...  Now they're saying that two of our stations are getting Beatles music.  Beatles music fed underneath our show?  That's not...  That's hysterical.  That's not the individual stations.  That's something probably to do with the satellite.  Wait, Joe is our guy in, uh, Boston.  Hold on.  Let's, uh...  Hey, Joe.  Hey.  What's going on?  I thought you guys were messing with me.  What do you mean?  Uh, all of a sudden during the break,  um, all of a sudden, uh, just, like,  two things started coming over the satellite.  And, uh, I...  You know, and then you guys said that over... 
[01:45:00]  Oh, uh, you know, that some guy was saying  that Beatles music was coming over.  I thought you guys were messing with us.  So I called up, um,  to see if we were the only ones.  And I guess we're not the only ones.  But I don't know what's going on.  So they're feeding Beatle music  while we're trying to do a radio show?  It sounds like there's another radio station  on our satellite at the same time.  Oh, my...  Something's going on.  I don't know.  I called up because I'm like, you know,  just, I didn't know if, you know,  you guys were messing with that dude on the phone  or whatever, you know.  I'm like, hey...  Tell me they were playing Beatle music  under Carlson C.  And spots.  Oh, no, just during this last spot break. 
[01:45:30]  I don't know when it started.  I noticed it during the spot break  and when I parted you guys back up.  Why do they have to feed Beatle music?  Doesn't every radio station in America  have a Beatles catalog?  They've got a special interview.  What are they feeding?  I have no idea.  Now it's like, what's going on?  There's some crappy Indian music playing.  They're playing news over O&A in Boston.  Now they're playing news over you.  Oh, my God.  I'm freaking out myself, man.  That's the sitar, Anthony.  They're doing some sitar stuff. 
[01:46:00]  Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.  I thought that guy was really high.  I'm like, there's no way they're playing Beatles music  over our show today.  I wouldn't do that.  Dude, they are.  It's coming in all over the place now  on instant feedback.  What are they saying, Anthony?  They're saying that they're playing Beatles music  and news now over our show.  What do you mean news?  Like, all of a sudden, you'll hear a news guy  talking about George Harrison.  Joe, you still hear it on your end?  Hold on.  Let me pop up the air feed.  You guys said that. 
[01:46:30]  You know, that some guy was saying that.  Oh, I hear that.  Yeah, it's still going on.  Yeah, I do hear a little something.  What's in the background?  That would be you guys on air.  No, no, no.  I know that.  And then what?  An interview with George Harrison or something?  Hold on one second.  Let me pop this up.  There's not a radio station on our satellite at the same time.  Something's going on.  I hear it.  You hear the little guys talking in the background.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Should I hang up?  What do they do?  I don't know.  We're trying to get the...  I don't know.  Oh, Christ. 
[01:47:00]  There's a George Harrison tribute going behind our broadcast.  All right.  So we do a tribute to George Harrison, and you get to listen to our show.  We cover all the bases here, Opie.  Schizo Radio at its best.  All right, Joe.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Bye.  And the same thing is happening in Columbus.  Jason.  Jason, you still there?  Jason?  He's probably listening to his radio.  Or his name is Justin, and he doesn't know that we're talking to him.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Hello, hello, hello, hello. 
[01:47:30]  Scrum.  Not there.  Beatles crap is annoying.  Great.  Mike.  What's up?  What's going on, ONA?  Hey.  Hey, they're doing it here in Boston.  You can hear the Beatles playing loud and clear.  Beatles playing.  Yeah.  One of the, sounds like it might be the old station here, the classic rock station, 100.7 here.  No, I think it's, Westwood One is feeding some special Beatles George Harrison tribute during our show.  Over our show.  During our show. 
[01:48:00]  Mike from Hoboken wants to know if they're using, for our syndication, the My First Radio Satellite System.  I hope this doesn't go over with the Britney contest.  Oh, funny.  Oh, great.  Well, the Britney contest is going to blow.  No.  All right.  No.  You guys won't let it blow.  All right.  We'll figure something out.  Thank you, Mike.  Beatles commentary.  They're playing Sentimental Man.  Oh, my God.  It's happening in Cleveland as well.  Beatles, and it sounds like the BBC in Vegas, and yes, over Carlos also. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, Greg, what's up?  Oh, man.  It's pissing me off here.  Carlos is funny as hell, and I can't even hear him because of the damn Beatles.  Oh, boy.  I haven't listened to it all day because I got someone who loves him.  Now I get to listen to you guys, and I can't hear a damn thing.  All right.  Thank you, Greg.  Thanks, guys.  You're great.  It's not happening in New York, but it's happening everywhere else where they feed the show, right?  Ben?  Well, Pete Johnson, of course, is left because it's Friday, so he's not here, so he's the one that could...  God, I wish I had XM radio. 
[01:49:00]  I wouldn't have these problems.  Yeah.  I'm going to sign up for that when it comes out, Opie.  That's satellite radio.  I'm not going to put up with this crap anymore.  So if Pete Johnson's listening, if Pete could call us to fix the problem.  All right.  It's not happening in Philly because I switched to the Zephyr.  That's coming from Andrew.  Thank you, Andrew.  Thank you.  Thank you.  People, movers and shakers in Philly.  They got a backup system.  I like it. 
[01:49:30]  What the hell's a Zephyr?  Well, you know what?  Now we've got to take a break and try to figure this out.  Yeah, let's figure this out.  We just took a break.  Oh, we did?  Yes, we did.  Yeah, it came on BCN a few minutes ago.  It's like many voices in my head.  All right.  So what do we do?  What do we do?  What do we do?  Is there a plan?  Yeah, we're working on it.  Working on it?  Does Pete have a beeper?  Yeah, we've paged Pete 911. 
[01:50:00]  I don't know.  Well, you know.  Been hearing Yellow Submarine for the past 45 minutes.  I swear to God.  Oh, God, that's torture.  I am seconds away from losing my effing mind.  Earl, what?  We all have our...  What is Earl saying?  Rick's on the phone with Pete.  We all have our little moments of remembrance of George Harrison,  but, God, we don't want to hear the Yellow Submarine, do we?  We all live...  Shut up.  All right, well, we'll take a break, try to figure this out. 
[01:50:30]  Five o'clock hour, not many people are listening.  No problem.  Ah, that's it.  We'll be back with our mommies, hopefully,  without the Beatles music underneath us in just a bit.  Oh, yeah!  The there's about to rock!  Fuck!  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  We are Sports Guys, Blaine and Craig.  Morning, Don and Mike.  Midday. 
[01:51:00]  Opie and Anthony, afternoon.  Ron and Fez at night.  We are 1027 WNEW.  Hey, Anthony, Sam Adams.  All you need is Sam Adams.  All you need is Sam Adams.  Might as well.  Sam Adams.  Mm-mm-mm.  Oh, people are starting to request Beatles songs.  I swear to God, man.  Hey!  Hey!  You want to make your own TV commercial?  Maybe win $5,000 a year supply of Sam Adams beer  and a spot on national television, 
[01:51:30]  including Late Night with Conan O'Brien and VH1?  Mm-mm.  Go to projectgreenlight.com.  Enter the Sam Adams TV commercial contest.  You submit a 30-second commercial idea  for a Sam Adams lager commercial.  And you submit that to projectgreenlight.com.  And your entry's got to be in by December 3rd.  That's all you need to know.  Do that.  And drink Sam Adams while you do it.  Mm-mm.  We love it.  See that?  What do I got here? 
[01:52:00]  Sam Adams.  Look at Mike from Hoboken.  The countdown to Opie losing his mind begins in 5, 4, 3.  We love it here.  You will, too.  Sam Adams.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  How's that?  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  They're saying we have fixed the problem, man.  Yeah?  Opie!  Scott, what's up?  What's up, Opie? 
[01:52:30]  Opie and Anthony, I love you guys.  You guys are the best.  Thanks, thanks, thanks.  Loveless to be in New York.  Unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  What a dick.  Very funny, Scott.  What an ass.  He's trying to get me, man.  Because I said on the screen, I love when Opie goes ballistic. 
[01:53:00]  It's fixed, right?  Let's go to Joe in Boston and say, Joe?  Hey.  Are we back to normal?  I don't know.  I haven't gone back to the show yet.  Hold on.  Oh, that's right.  Because we're in like a three-minute delay on top of it.  30 seconds.  30 seconds?  We've been live for a minute already.  I know.  It's 30 more seconds.  Oh.  What, are we going to sit here and wait?  No.  All right, Joe.  We'll get back to him.  That's fine.  We'll get back to you in a second, all right?  All right, man.  Oh, my God.  Blue, not Joe. 
[01:53:30]  What's going on?  Hey, man.  Scott Muni is messing with you guys bad.  The ghost of Scott.  The Beatle is dead and he's jamming your airwaves with Beatle music.  Hey.  Well, because George Harrison hoo-hooed him with the John Lennon thing.  Later.  All right, Blue.  Oh, Christ.  Let's see if we're back live yet in Boston, even though we've been live in New York for  the last two minutes.  Joe.  Hey.  Hey.  It seems to be all set, man.  Yeah, I think we're okay.  All right.  Thank you, Joe.  All right, man.  Hey, we'll see you tomorrow, all right?  Okay.  Yeah, we're doing that CD signing live in Boston tomorrow, Anthony, and Newberry Comics on Route 
[01:54:00]  9 in Natick.  So, all right, Joe.  See you guys.  Bye.  How's our contest going over?  Oh, that's more important right now.  How are we doing?  Let me just breathe.  I know there's some ladies out there.  For our mom, what would you do for Britney Spears tickets contest?  Well, why don't we bring them in and...  All right.  Let's make...  Finally, we're going to get this underway.  Let's make some radio magic happen.  Oh, I'm sure it's going to be fantastic. 
[01:54:30]  Let's pull this one out of our you-know-what.  Here comes...  Who was the first one there, Rick?  Hi.  How are you?  Hello.  Look at this.  Two lovely young ladies walking in.  Mommies.  She's got big hands, Anthony.  Look at all.  Oh, sorry.  Sorry.  Don't just come right out with that.  She's pointing out the obvious there.  Very nice.  Ease him into it a little.  Very nice.  Now, who's who?  My office.  Here.  Yeah.  Talk right to that mic.  You can pull the mic down.  There you go.  My name is Helena.  Helena?  Yes. 
[01:55:00]  And you called, and what are you going to do for the Britney tickets?  Well, I was supposed to be doing the Wild Bikini.  The Wild Bikini in the pitch dark.  In the pitch dark, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Great.  That'll work.  Do we have flashlights?  We have some strong flashlights from the Booba Lantern contest?  We might.  We might.  Right.  And you know something, Times Square is very lit up.  Right.  So perhaps it'll be light enough in Times Square.  What do you need?  Well, do we have flashlights if she's going to walk around in her Wild Bikini, you know? 
[01:55:30]  Well, Pete left, so his office is locked.  Oh.  Here you go.  Well, yeah, like I said, Times Square, very light, very lit up.  It is the crossroads of the world, Opie.  It's all lit up, so maybe if she walks down there.  Well, we'd have to get this underway immediately.  Good.  Helena, you all right?  Yes, I'm fine.  You'll still do this, right?  Sure.  In Times Square now?  Fine.  We're going to have to see her bikini.  Where is it? 
[01:56:00]  Under your clothes?  Oh, no.  I suppose I'm making a bikini out of the Wild Stickers.  Right.  We'll get the Wild Stickers.  She can do it right here in the studio while we talk to her.  All right.  And you're...  Erin.  Erin.  Erin.  There you go.  Erin became famous this week.  Yeah.  She called in earlier this week.  You're 19?  Yes.  She has a four-year-old, Anthony.  Four-year-old.  Pregnant at 14.  Yes.  She's a dirty little girl.  Yes.  At 14, she got herself pregnant and had the baby for some reason. 
[01:56:30]  You're cute.  Oh, thank you.  And then the father took off after three months, I guess?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Great guy.  Helena, get to it, man.  Can't be shy now.  No.  All right.  All right.  Helena's taking her headphones off as we talk to Erin and...  I'll be back.  All right.  She'll be back.  She's going to go put the Wow bikini on.  There you go.  She's got her stickers all ready to go.  Make a bikini out of those Wow stickers.  And then we'll bring her down to Times Square where it's nice and bright. 
[01:57:00]  We're the worst.  And, Erin, you want to suck on Stalker Patty's hammer toes, right?  Yes.  Did you meet her out there?  Oh, yeah.  What's your impression of her?  Strange.  Very, very strange.  Yeah, a lot of people think Stalker Patty's a bit.  No, it's as real as it gets, right?  No, she's real.  You met her and talked to her and she pulled her wig off to show you the hair growing back  and stuff.  Oh, did she?  She hasn't given us an update, a hair growing update.  Yeah.  I haven't seen under that nasty wig.  Yeah, let's bring in Stalker Patty.  Stalker Patty. 
[01:57:30]  Ugh.  Hi, how are you?  Hi.  Over here, Patty.  Hi, Patty.  How many times have you been on our show?  You don't even...  Well, we don't let her get that close to me.  Hey, we don't let her get that close to me.  Oh, is that what the deal is?  Yeah.  I'm not going to get that close.  Hi.  Take your wig off, Patty, so we can see the hair growing back.  Oh, wow.  That looks exactly like it did last time.  Didn't you say that it would be grown back by Thanksgiving?  Oh, by Thanksgiving.  Well, I already exaggerated a little bit.  Maybe I'm a little hopeful.  Yeah, a little hopeful.  Maybe next Thanksgiving. 
[01:58:00]  No, no.  Yeah, I think so.  By then it'll be shoulder length.  Oh, please.  Barely.  Maybe if someone pounds your head into your chest...  No.  No.  It's the only way it's going to be shoulder length on you.  I'm going to throw back down nicely, okay.  Are you losing weight, Patty?  Is that possible?  I think it is.  She doesn't work at McDean's anymore, so she can't pilfer any of the stock.  You've lost more weight, haven't you?  I'm 110 pounds.  Did you steal that top from my great aunt?  No.  I know.  Look at that. 
[01:58:30]  Where'd you get that from?  I had it.  I don't remember.  It looks like a tablecloth.  It's got curves on her like parallel lines.  Look at it.  I have a boyish figure.  Boyish.  Boyish.  It's got a shape like an eraser.  Oh, stop.  A pair, really.  But it just goes straight.  That doesn't accentuate your lovely breasts.  That shirt.  All right, Patty, take your shoes and socks off so we can see the hammer toes again.  Put the wig back on. 
[01:59:00]  I want to make sure Erin's willing to do this.  Rick, let her sit in that chair so she can sit.  All right.  Take your shoes and socks off.  Roll her that way so she's closer to Erin and further from me, Rick.  No, no, like that way.  No, don't pull yourself.  But turn her so we can see.  There you go.  All right, Patty, if you would kick off those shoes that have to contain those.  Look at these hammer toes. 
[01:59:30]  Wait to see these toes.  Oh, look at the look on Erin's face.  They're all tasty white.  Erin, what do you think?  I put my shoes and socks off.  Oh, I don't know what I got myself into.  Oh, look at those toenails.  Oh, look at those toenails.  Oh, my God.  Patty, they're brown.  Put that foot back on the counter.  Look at that.  I had sex. 
[02:00:00]  Why don't you clip that thing?  Look at that disgusting.  It's uncomfortable to do it like that.  Your right foot makes a left-hand turn and a sharp one at that, man.  I can't help it.  It's just the way my feet are.  When she walks on the tile floor, it's like when the Velociraptor was walking.  Click, click, click.  Click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click.  When was the last time you clipped those toenails?  It's the Velociraptor clicking on the floor. 
[02:00:30]  It just gets uncomfortable.  They're talking to each other.  Well, it hurts.  When was the last time you clipped them, though?  It's been a while.  Not really.  The other floor aren't long.  Patty, do you understand that that, first of all, not only does it just look disgusting,  that's fine because you keep your shoes and socks on, but don't you understand that it  probably hurts more because you don't cut it?  So it's probably hurting you because your toenail is digging into the front of your shoe  and hurting you that way? 
[02:01:00]  I know.  God, I want to step on it.  But I keep putting it off.  I just want to squish it like a roach.  It's very easy to put something like that off.  Put something off?  Clip the goddamn nail.  Put the foot back on the counter.  It's just pleasant.  Put the foot back.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, it looks like the old Coke nails from the 80s that people had on their pinky.  I snort Coke in my big toenail.  Raise it up to, do you want to toot?  Erin, what do you think?  Do you want to bump?  What do you think that's going to hurt there? 
[02:01:30]  It looks sharp.  Yes, you can cut your tongue off.  You thought this was going to be easy?  What are the odds of you putting that toe in your mouth?  I'll do it for the ticket.  All right.  Hey, Patty, did you wash your feet today?  Yes, I did.  I got good hygiene.  Is it going to hurt if Erin puts your toe in her mouth?  I would have to rinse them off again because I was wearing shoes and I didn't walk.  No, there's no rinsing.  That's it.  Get a pail so she could, like, dunk it a couple times.  I really should.  Okay.  You know, and from last week when I saw her foot the first time, she's cleaned it up a bit. 
[02:02:00]  That's cleaned up a bit?  Yeah, that's clean.  It's brown.  It's a brown nail issue.  It used to be yellow, dude.  It's a brown toe.  Oh, it looks like a big Dorito she glued to her big toe.  A Frito corn chip.  Big, bent, long Fritos corn chip.  Erin, you're having second doubts, aren't you?  Yeah.  It's like a clamshell.  It weighs in, though.  Doesn't it?  Look at it.  Look at it.  Look at it. 
[02:02:30]  The toenail itself makes a left-hand turn, too.  Because of my hand itself.  Well, maybe the guy during the peticorps cure could.  The peticorps cure.  The peticorps cure.  She's such a wacko.  She's now trying to talk like you talk when you're imitating her.  Will you just talk normal?  I would like to watch her swoop down and grab a rabbit with those things.  Carry it off to a nest.  Ed, someone wants to know what's grosser.  Mouthful of cotton or Patty's toe. 
[02:03:00]  I saw Patty on the side of a riverbank flinging salmon off onto the riverbank.  Flop.  Big talons.  Big claws.  Oh, my God.  Look at that thing.  Well, like an ostrich.  Use it as a weapon.  She just kicks people.  You can puncture a kangaroo with it.  Did you take off your other sock and shoe?  I took them both.  All right.  Put both feet up on the counter.  Let's see if one's worse than the other. 
[02:03:30]  Oh, my God.  Put your foot up there.  That one's worse.  Which one's worse, Erin?  This one.  The right or the left?  The right.  The right one's worse?  Yeah.  That's the one you'll be sucking on.  Oh, it is, yeah.  But I really want to rinse them first.  It's not a consideration.  Someone smell Patty's toes.  No.  No.  No.  No.  God damn it.  Holy cow.  That's not necessary.  Dude, you just made me gag by saying that.  That's not necessary.  I just gag just by saying that. 
[02:04:00]  You're saying that.  Put your right foot on the counter.  I'm not necessary.  Put it up on the counter and leave it there.  All right.  Put it up and leave it there.  Rest it up on the counter.  Just put it up there.  Do it.  Erin.  Erin, just give it a quick.  Put your heel up there.  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  That sucks.  Oh, my God.  Look at it.  Look at it.  That sucks, Dawn.  She's grabbing the console.  To one toe is grabbing another.  Oh, God.  Look at that.  I'm sorry.  I can't help it.  Your toes are fighting with each other, man.  I'm going to vomit.  They're alive.  Well, I hope you never know the pain sometimes that I feel. 
[02:04:30]  I got the pain of looking at it.  I think it's very comparable to the pain we're feeling right now.  Erin, just give it a little.  Patty, put your heel up on the.  Patty, put your heel.  Right.  Oh, my God.  Dude, look at it.  Look at it.  Oh, he's got the under view.  Dude, what does it look like?  The big toe goes under the other toe.  Yeah.  She's got that big, gnarly, like, knuckle thing happening.  And Patty, how do you put shoes on?  Your big toenail has got to be almost an inch. 
[02:05:00]  It's disgusting.  That's almost an inch above the skin.  Oh, my God.  Steve C's getting an ultra close-up of the underside of that disgusting thing.  Erin, just give it a sniff.  All right, Erin, sniff it.  Just a sniff it.  I sniffed it.  Erin?  Oh, what does it smell like?  I have them in shoes, and I'm walking on all day.  It smells like Fritos.  Oh, I am so disgusting.  But I'm walking around all day. 
[02:05:30]  All right.  Oh.  You have to be, you know.  Patty, put it back up there.  You've got to leave it up there.  Yeah, leave that thing up there.  That claw.  Can you hold this one?  Oh, don't make her touch things.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Oh, God damn it.  Is the bikini lady almost set to go to Times Square?  She's ready.  She's ready.  We'll bring her in.  Leave your foot up there, Patty.  Wow bikini lady's coming back in the studio wearing nothing but a wow bikini. 
[02:06:00]  Jamaica Mike, it's a false alarm.  You're supposed to only show up on good shows.  Jamaica Mike, check out her foot, man.  Look at this toe.  Please.  What is going on there?  Isn't that disgusting?  Oh, God.  Come on, Patty.  You've got to cut those.  Come on, man.  You've got to cut that toe down.  You've got to cut those.  Who's got clippers, man?  We'll do it right now.  Patty, cut the goddamn thing.  It doesn't hurt.  That's not going to hurt.  Get a Sawzall. 
[02:06:30]  Cut it off with a Sawzall.  Can we try cutting your nail today?  Whoa.  Wow.  Wow bikini.  The wow bikini mall.  Looking good.  Hey, you did a good job there.  You did really good.  And you're going to get a bikini wax when you take that off, too.  My God, you're sealed up, aren't you?  You have nothing.  Turn around.  Let's see that Buddha.  You have nothing underneath that?  Oh, Mike, what do you like that, Mike?  Mike likes that booty.  Jamaica Mike likes that booty.  Yeah, man.  Beautiful. 
[02:07:00]  Can we get a picture for the website?  Yeah.  We need a...  Okay, Rick's taking pictures of the wow bikini girl.  And Earl has handed me the Britney Spears tickets.  Mike likes that booty.  Yeah.  You'd turn her right around, wouldn't you?  That's right.  You having sex.  It would look like someone clubbing a baby seal, wouldn't it?  Just whacking that thing to death until it's bleeding.  It would be fur and flesh and blood flying and a big bloody club.  All right.  Rick, why don't you head out with wow bikini girl, get in a cab and get down to Times Square 
[02:07:30]  immediately, get on the phone and...  I don't want to miss this one.  Oh, please.  You don't want to miss hardened toenail?  I don't want to see her...  Now, what is Earl going to do to that toe?  I want to cut it off with an M80.  You should chew on her now.  Look at the fur on the bottom of her foot from the side.  Oh, she touches it.  Fur.  I don't have...  Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  Patty, listen to me.  Listen to me.  Patty.  Touch your toenail.  Put it between your thumb and forefinger. 
[02:08:00]  Go ahead.  My toenail?  Your toenail.  Yeah.  No, the tip.  The tip.  Rub the tip.  Yeah, rub it.  Now, put that finger in your mouth.  Go ahead.  Put it in your mouth.  Put the finger in your mouth.  Put it in your mouth.  Patty.  Wait, wait, wait.  Why is it black on your toes?  Because it's dying.  No, lift your toe.  Seriously, underneath.  Look at that.  It's part of the rabbit fur.  It's the bottom of your shoes.  No, man.  That's like dead brown skin.  On the other side of the nail. 
[02:08:30]  Where the toes attached to the actual foot underneath is dark brown.  She doesn't even have a full pinky nail.  No, I don't.  It's just a little mump.  Sorry.  You know, we could have Aaron do the first half of this and then we could take a break  and then Helena will be in Times Square with the Wow Bikini.  You want to do that, Anthony?  How long does Aaron have to suck on Stucker Patty's toes?  Length of a Britney Spears. 
[02:09:00]  That's the rules, right?  All right.  I say 60 seconds is plenty of time.  Trust me.  As we play some Britney music?  Soak my foot first.  No.  Soak it.  Don't put the water through that kind of crap.  No, but it should.  You know, I had my foot in a shoe, you know, and walked around, you know, out of consideration.  Out of consideration.  Someone wants to know if her feet look like Jim Carrey from Dumb and Dumber after pedicure. 
[02:09:30]  Yes.  Before the pedicure.  Now that's to take him a sander to it.  All right.  Why don't we get Aaron doing it for 60 seconds?  All right.  Do we have a Britney song we can play in the background?  I don't even know if we need any music.  Yeah.  I think really low in the background.  You know, like the Beatles music was before.  Really low.  Aaron, are you ready to do this?  Yeah, I'll do it.  You are?  You're not going to let me rinse my foot off?  No.  No. 
[02:10:00]  There's no rinsing.  No rinsing.  It's just lint.  I'm very sanitary.  You're not very sanitary.  Not with a toe like that.  Stop it.  No.  All right.  What do you think, Aaron?  You put it down even more.  It's just got to be barely there so we can hear every painful detail of this.  All right.  Aaron has a minute to go at it with Stalker Patty's toe.  We got to mic both girls, though.  You know what?  We're going to need the music off because you're going to hear some sounds coming from Aaron 
[02:10:30]  and Stalker Patty here.  You know.  Oh, my God.  Look, she's looking.  Don't look at it.  Don't touch it.  Don't even look at it.  I'll tell you right now, Aaron, if you puke after doing this, you get the touch.  Do you think you're going to puke?  Do you think you'll puke?  I hope not.  It's really...  Hey, maybe if you'd have sucked on stuff at 14, you wouldn't have gotten pregnant.  I can't wash the toe.  There's my car coming out.  There's what coming out?  Hair.  Where's the hair? 
[02:11:00]  Oh, you have good hygiene.  She's got hairy toe knuckles.  Yeah, that's hairy.  Oh, my God.  Look at it with that big nail.  Look at you.  There's ribs on her nail like ridges from a...  You can count how old she is on those things.  But all feet have fine hair along the toe.  Yeah, fine hair.  That's not normal.  Not that.  You're like a goddamn monkey.  I'm not a monkey.  Yeah, I'm not a monkey.  I'm an ant and a hook.  Look at that foot.  All right.  Erin, what do you think? 
[02:11:30]  Erin's too cute to do this, I'm thinking, man.  Why are we doing this for...  Those poor socks that Patty wears, too.  Look at them.  They're the same type of socks that should be on like a cheerleader's foot or something.  A hot foot.  Oh, my God.  And then she buys them in the socks.  I'm like, oh, look at what we got to cover.  Oh, Anthony Owen on line 11.  The crap under the nail is fungus.  Oh, no.  No one should be sucking on that.  I don't have...  Why not just let the guy clip the nail? 
[02:12:00]  Should we do this or not?  I'm getting even further away.  I think I have a cold and the smell's wafting over here.  All right.  This could be the most disgusting thing.  Erin, get ready.  You got 60 seconds to impress us.  Starting in...  With your toe-sucking ability.  Starting in 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.  Suck, Stork and Patty.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Get on there. 
[02:12:30]  Get on there.  Oh, my God.  She's giving Stork and Patty's toe oral treats.  Get the mic in Patty's face.  Oh, my God.  What does it taste like?  What does it taste like?  Come on, get in there.  What does it taste like?  It's horrible.  Get back down there.  Get back down there.  Patty, lift that foot up.  Lift the foot up.  Sorry.  Oh, my God.  She's like...  She's really working the big toe, Anthony.  I can't...  She keeps pulling it down.  Yeah, but lift that up there. 
[02:13:00]  It feels weird.  Hey, come on.  This chick was pregnant at 14.  Someone grab the back of her head and push.  She's probably used to that.  Yeah, 30 seconds to go, Erin.  She's working the toe like a woman would work the...  Oh, she's gagging.  She's gagging.  She's just gagging.  She's got 20 seconds left.  She's gagging.  Keep going.  Keep going.  She's gagging.  She's gagging.  Grab that big toe now.  She's got 20 seconds left because she keeps...  15 seconds. 
[02:13:30]  She's gagging.  She might not make it.  Take it all in.  Take it all in.  Take it all.  Yeah, suck on that toe.  10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  She lost.  Oh, she's hacking.  Are you okay?  Grab a mic.  Grab that microphone.  Oh, my God.  Are you all right?  Yeah, that was just bad.  Oh, my God. 
[02:14:00]  Describe it as best you can.  What was it like, the taste, the feel, everything?  It was, like, hard and pointy, and it was poking my tongue.  What did it taste like?  Like stale food.  Oh, shut up.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah, there's some water for you.  She went down on that toe like, you know, it was, you know what? 
[02:14:30]  That was great.  Like, she's drinking water now, trying to get that nasty taste.  You want a shot?  I must say how gross that looks.  She does have good technique.  Yeah, it was nice technique.  She's got the tongue involved and everything.  Well, she hasn't had another kid since she was 14, so maybe she's learned a little.  She has perfected.  How to do something.  Patty, how was that?  It was very strange.  It was very strange.  You ever had anyone suck on your toes? 
[02:15:00]  You haven't had anyone suck on your toes before, huh?  No.  No.  The only time it got wet's in the shower.  Were you turned down by that?  Did it feel sexy?  Some people were turned down by that.  Did it feel a little good, Patty?  Did you get a little tingle?  No, not really.  What if the edge from you two was doing it?  I don't think so.  That would have been nice.  Yeah, I'm sure the edge would love that big toenail.  No.  Holy God.  Get me a Guinness.  Yeah, I've had a foot problem since I was young. 
[02:15:30]  Can't do anything about it.  Yeah, we know.  We know.  We're going to get you a pedicure soon.  Aaron?  Yeah, we'll get you a pedicure.  You all right over there?  I got a hazmat team to do it.  Yeah.  Wow, that was pretty good.  I don't want to look at it again.  You don't want to look because you're gagging.  Just think of that in your mouth.  She started gagging like 40 seconds into it.  Oh.  That was gross.  Sure, she'd rather have an uncut Haitian in her mouth than that. 
[02:16:00]  All right, Anthony.  Oof.  That's a make-a-mike.  Helena, that's going to be tough to beat, I got to tell you.  Yeah, that's tough.  But who knows what's going to happen when she gets out there in the middle of Times Square  with that tiny, tiny wow bikini on.  Yeah.  The wow sticker bikini is on.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Rick's going to rush down to Times Square in a cab with Helena, and we'll talk to them  next, okay?  Someone said last time you saw nails like that.  Good idea.  They were crushing buildings in Tokyo. 
[02:16:30]  That's good.  Hey, Rick, get out of here with Helena, and we'll talk to you in a few minutes.  Jim, what's up?  Yeah, guys, man.  I just puked all over my suit, all over the inside of my truck.  Oh, that is so nasty.  Oh, that was just nasty.  So disgusting.  You know, when people say that, I usually don't believe them, but I believe you today, Jim.  I'm telling you, that was the nastiest thing I ever heard.  Aaron was pretty much gagging and very close to just dry heaving.  Oh, poor thing. 
[02:17:00]  Woof.  Just giving the tickets.  All right.  Thank you, Jim.  Be good, guys.  Have a good weekend.  Rick, you got to leave because we're running out of time.  Yeah, yeah.  Gary, what's up?  Get it down there.  What's up, boys?  She's gargling.  Listen, Aaron's going to have to drive home with her tongue out the car window.  Very good, bro.  Look, she's gargling.  What are you gargling with?  Listerine.  Listerine.  Now, even Listerine, I don't think can handle the germs that you just ingested.  I'm going to disinfect my mouth now.  Oh, God.  That was disgusting.  Why, Patty? 
[02:17:30]  Because you have good hygiene.  Hygiene.  I take a shower.  I can't help it if I'm walking around in the shoe all day.  Tell us what you have.  Good what?  There's a fire in your shoe.  You have good what, Patty?  Hygiene.  I take a shower every day.  I'm very clean.  What is it called?  What is it?  Good what?  What?  I don't know what it's called.  Good what?  Hygiene.  Hygiene.  Hygiene.  I got good hygiene.  Hygiene.  Someone wants to know if...  Look at my toenails, Gene.  Someone wants to know if Aaron's hallucinating.  Kind of like when you lick a frog or something. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah, he's going on some kind of a fungus trip.  Like a mushroom growing under there.  Hell, man.  It looks like a mushroom growing under one of those toes.  A big mushroom.  We'll check in with Rick and Helena, hopefully in the middle of Times Square.  Yeah.  When we get back.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  At the last supper, they would have wiped their asses with the tablecloth.  That's just what Christ wanted. 
[02:18:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  Thanks.  That was some scene in here.  God damn, is that disgusting.  I believe Steve from foundrymusic.com adds a video.  He'll put it up later tonight.  You know, of Aaron sucking on Stalker Patty's hammer toes.  There is some real disgusting video.  I saw where Steve was putting that camera.  He got a back shot of the bottom of Patty's foot looking at the underside of that disgusting, 
[02:19:00]  wrinkled, rippled potato chip O'Nail.  And he was right there when she started sucking on it.  It's kind of like the green.  Let me see.  It's kind of like the green potato chip, Anthony.  Oh, the green one you pull out of the bag?  And it's still got the ripples in it.  The ruffles have ridges potato chips.  You know how gross it was?  Ben was getting really pissed off and had to leave the studio.  Ben hates anything like this, and this was really a little much.  What do you think, Ben? 
[02:19:30]  It was beyond disgusting.  First of all, she's a mutant, and she's disgusting, and should be killed.  But she was beyond disgusting.  And I was in the other studio with Earl, and Earl was full of crap.  Earl got sick, and Earl went and threw up.  Yeah, Anthony, Earl puked.  God!  Oh!  What are you looking at, the video?  I'm watching the video.  You've got to paint over here, Steve.  Oh!  I just saw it.  Don't.  Hopping down on that huge yellow nail.  Oh, my God. 
[02:20:00]  Oh!  Earl, you didn't really hear.  Anthony, you didn't hear Ben, though.  Earl puked.  Earl puked.  Yeah, I hear Earl puking at his desk right now.  Earl ran to his desk and vomited into a garbage pail.  He was in there with me, and he goes...  Yeah, look at that.  Look at the big yellow nail.  Look at it.  Stop!  See?  Oh, my God.  I didn't...  See, I saw the other side of it, because of my head.  Oh, man. 
[02:20:30]  I can't even look at that.  I defy you to watch this all the way through.  Oh, my God.  I saw it from a completely different angle, and my angle wasn't that bad.  That video was bad.  Oh, wow.  You see her head come up, and her mouth slides off of that big yellow toenail.  George, what's up?  Guys, stop.  Dude, let me...  Hey, George, let me put it in a little more perspective for you, if you need that. 
[02:21:00]  Everyone has been to an outdoor pool area or something where you see someone's toenail  that is big and yellow and disgusting.  Yeah.  Picture that even worse.  I'm playing in sewers for 30 years.  I had a pool over a puke.  You guys are killing me.  Earl, come here.  Get on mic, man.  Earl?  Get on mic.  Earl, what happened?  You ran away.  I ran.  I fought it.  Just stop it.  Oh, Steve just showed us out of the video.  I just stopped. 
[02:21:30]  And then, like, the phone rang.  I pick up the phone.  I went, hold on.  And I just started just wrecking.  Yeah, puking.  Not puking.  I was just gagging.  It wouldn't come out.  I was just like...  I am totally, like, gagging thinking of this.  I have arrested homeless crack horse that have had cleaner feet.  And stalker patty.  Keep the cop, everyone.  I'm doing everything to get that mental image out of my head.  No, that's something that sticks with you.  Hey, Wayne, what's up? 
[02:22:00]  Hey, what's up, guys?  How you doing?  All right.  I've been through everything with you guys, man.  And this time, I actually had to turn the radio down or almost off because I couldn't take it.  It wasn't one of those things I almost turned the radio off.  You had to.  Follow this logic.  You had to do it.  Our syndication company screwed us over by playing Beatles music underneath our show today.  Yeah.  So you guys had to suffer.  That's what we do.  This was the worst.  All right, Wayne.  Thanks.  Totally.  All right, okay.  Take care.  Bye-bye. 
[02:22:30]  Only thing grocer would be to suck on twaddle.  That is true, Terry.  Oh, God.  That is true.  By the way.  Oh, man.  Can we get some guy to do that?  By the way.  By the way, next Friday on the Opie and Anthony show, what the hell is that?  What the hell is that?  We're finally going to diagnose twaddle.  It was inspired by twaddle.  And a bunch of other people are coming down with things they don't really know what it  is on their body.  And we're going to have doctors down here, and they're going to be diagnosing people.  I hope we can set it up for next Friday. 
[02:23:00]  Next Friday on the Opie and Anthony show, what the hell is that?  Dude, I just keep getting these flashes of gross, like I get the chills, goosebumps, and  I gag.  We have one more contestant.  Hello?  Yo.  All right, hold on a sec.  We have one more contestant left in the mommy, what would you do for Britney Spears contest,  Anthony.  Her name is Helena.  She has a very tiny WOW bumper sticker bikini on, and she's in the middle of Times Square  with Rick.  Rick, what's up?  Hey, guys.  We are here at 44th, right on Times Square. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah.  Um, and she's still got the jacket covering her, and it, wouldn't you know it, it's the  shopping season, the holiday shopping season.  Yeah, a lot of people.  Very good.  Gorgeous weather out.  And Helena, are you just about ready to take the jacket off?  Yes, I am.  All right, so here we go.  All right.  Are you ready?  We should have had video down there, but I think we have a camera.  Here she goes.  Digital camera, yeah.  As she disrobes.  And I'm getting the, uh, the S-word flying out of a man with three kids. 
[02:24:00]  And now we're going to start walking around.  Let's talk, let's talk to this guy who just said the S-word.  Sir, where are you from?  Uh, Jersey.  Do you see the, uh, girl standing in front of you?  Sure do.  And what do you think?  Uh, a little exercise wouldn't help.  Yeah.  Uh-oh, now she's getting into a fight with the guy's wife.  All right. 
[02:24:30]  We're going to...  Okay, thank you.  That's all you say.  We'll fight for him.  We're going to move on.  What happened, Rick?  Um, she got into an argument with the guy's wife about being too heavy.  Yeah, the guy said, well, a little exercise would help.  And the wife is like, well, I just think you're too heavy, you know?  Wow.  So now we are, uh, we're, we're, we got the walk side.  We're walking across.  Okay.  To the center island.  You know where you always see MTV and stuff?  Yeah.  That's where we're headed to right this second.  Are you, uh...  And, uh, she's getting a lot of stares. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah, you're getting some weird looks, huh?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  And she's just walking and the, uh, surprisingly the bikini's staying on.  I'm wondering if, uh, we should maybe take a few stickers off, uh, Rick.  What do you think?  Should we take a few stickers off?  Just a couple, uh, stickers off.  All right.  Which one should I go for?  Actually, you know what?  You should have some tourists, uh, take stickers off.  All right.  Let's see.  Ask a tourist if they want to take one of the wild bumper stickers off of Helena.  All right.  Let's see.  Make a tourist take one off that'll have hair on it. 
[02:25:30]  I got a guy walking past.  Come here.  Come here.  Come here.  Come here, dude.  Come here.  What's your name?  Rick.  No.  What's your name?  Lou.  Lou.  Yeah.  All right.  Lou, uh, we need you to remove one of the bumper stickers you see on, uh, Helena.  You want me?  Yeah.  You want me to remove one?  Yeah.  Uh, whichever one you want.  Whichever one I want.  Yeah.  Rick, put the phone near Helena because you might scream.  It's okay with her.  All right.  All right.  Okay.  Here we go.  Rick? 
[02:26:00]  Rick?  Yeah?  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Dude, just one.  There he goes.  He pulled one off and he pulled it off the side.  The side?  Oh, the side.  So he's still covered up front.  Well, Anthony, I'm getting to some here.  I want to see how many stickers Helena will allow us to take off a real-time score.  That's one.  Ah, that's a good one.  Hey, Rick, uh, let's ask, let's ask Helena if she's willing to have another guy, uh, take  a sticker off her.  Let's find someone else.  All right.  Uh, dude, you with the camera. 
[02:26:30]  All right, he's going to get a camera.  First, he's getting a picture.  He's definitely a, uh, he's definitely a tourist.  All right.  Where are you from, dude?  Friends.  Friends?  Who is he?  This is Opie and Anthony.  Oh, hi.  This is Jonathan from France.  I wanted to take a picture with Mrs. Nice Bigfoot.  Oh, goddamn frog.  And we are now down from Times Square, and I'm going to take a picture with her.  You want to take a sticker off her?  I surrender.  Thank you for everything.  I give up.  I surrender.  I surrender.  You're in. 
[02:27:00]  The video of Big Boots of America.  Oh, stop your yapping.  Stick a big loaf of French bread in her mouth.  International endorsement right there, guys.  We couldn't, we couldn't do this in France because the women are too hairy.  We'd heard them, but yeah, off the stickers.  Now they're still taking a shirt off and do it there.  All right, so Rick, is he going to, is the French guy going to take a sticker off?  Yeah.  Okay, now we need you to remove, we need you to remove one of the stickers from her.  I have to take one.  Yeah, take one.  Take a sticker and take it off.  Michael, wait, wait.  As soon as he's done.  Ready? 
[02:27:30]  He won one.  He won one.  He won one.  He's going to take it off.  I think.  Okay, wait.  All right.  Hello?  Oh.  It's a little crazy.  There he is.  We're all going crazy.  Which one they take off, Rick?  Hey, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick.  All right, dude, come here.  All right.  Rick.  Oh, my goodness.  I need help.  Rick, we lost you.  Did that guy take a sticker off?  He's talking to somebody.  Now he's going to take the sticker off.  Okay.  Okay. 
[02:28:00]  So, this is everyone.  I'm going to take off the sticker.  This one, Rick.  Oh, God, do I despise the French.  Rick, punch Frenchy in the face.  Opie, don't you wish he was 60 feet underwater so he can take his ass?  And now, Jonathan, he's going to take off the biggest seat.  Oh, God, please.  On 102.7.  102.7.  Oh, my God.  All right, Rick, what happened?  He just pulled the front off.  Please, Eiffel Tower, fall over on those people.  Fall over on those horrid people. 
[02:28:30]  All right, we're going to leave the crazy French guy.  All right.  What sticker did he pull off?  He pulled off one shoulder.  Brother, one.  Want me to see the other side here?  Yeah, the other side there.  Oh, shoulders.  Ooh, those wacky French.  Wow, he's a brave man.  Take off one that's already coming off from moisture.  And we got a couple of guys in a...  I won't say what type of vehicle it is, but it does have a siren of some sort.  Ah, well, maybe a fireman.  You guys want to remove a sticker? 
[02:29:00]  You guys want to remove a sticker?  Oh, God, no, no, no, no.  There's too many people around here.  They're going to be out of trouble with the job.  Too many people.  All right, so we're going to let those guys move along.  Yeah, how about you do that?  All right.  But they do have a camcorder.  This is legal, isn't it?  Does Helena want more stickers removed, Rick?  Helena, do you want more stickers removed?  Sure, why not?  All right.  Ah, she sounds like a game for the whole thing.  This is for the birthday series. 
[02:29:30]  Hey, you ready?  Less talk and more tearing.  What's your name?  Bob.  All right, we got Bob here.  He's going to remove a sticker.  Okay.  Which sticker is he removing?  Hey, you guys rock, man.  Where should I remove it from?  Take this one.  All right, he's going downtown.  The best sticker.  Which one's he going for?  I can see some hair, guys.  You can see some hair.  She doesn't want you to show it down there.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Which one did he take off? 
[02:30:00]  Yes.  Go ahead, Rick.  Um, I just noticed that as the stickers are coming off, she's got her brawn panties on.  What?  She has her brawn panties on?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  She fooled us.  What?  She's got her brawn panties.  You have your brawn panties on.  Oh, I should have.  I can.  I can put them on.  Oh, she fooled us with the brawn panties.  She's got brawn panties.  She's got brawn panties on under the stickers, which we couldn't see because she did such a great 
[02:30:30]  Oh, my God, you bitch.  I can't believe it.  Make her rip all the goddamn stickers off and walk back in her brawn panties.  All right.  Rip all the goddamn stickers off and walk back in your brawn panties.  Can I help?  Yeah, you can help her.  Thank you very much.  And punch her in her fat ass.  Oh, that's okay.  No, let me.  All right, Rick.  We'll check in with you in a little bit, all right?  Damn it.  It's going so well.  God, I hate that. 
[02:31:00]  We're on panties under the wow bumper sticker bikini.  That's annoying.  We were hoodwinked.  Horn swoggled.  Damn it.  That could have been good, too.  Smitty, what's up?  God, I hate the French.  Yeah.  What's up, Smitty?  Yeah, that stuff under Patty's toes, it's total fungus.  Oh, yeah?  She's got to get medicine.  It's nasty.  I mean, other people can get that.  It's the same fungus as, like, you get ringworm or athlete's foot. 
[02:31:30]  All right.  We're not too worried about it.  It's nasty.  It should have been in that girl's mouth.  We can only hope Aaron didn't catch anything.  All right, Smitty.  Thank you.  Let's go back to Rick.  Hey, Rick.  Yo.  What's going on now?  Well, he took all the stickers off, and, yeah, she's got her bra and her panties on.  You can still see hair, though.  Thanks, sir.  Thanks, sir.  She wants to know if she's disqualified.  We got some...  Is that all of that?  Well, no, she's not disqualified. 
[02:32:00]  We'll have to leave it to the listeners.  She's going to have to come up with a big finish, Rick, because, I mean, come on.  Aaron's sucked on, you know, Stalky Patty's hammer toes.  Does she have any other tricks up her sleeve?  All right.  Uh, Helena, do you have any other tricks up your sleeve?  We're running out of time.  Yeah, you are running out of time.  Yeah.  Tell me, Jim, give me something.  Uh, she's got nothing.  Yeah.  All right, Rick.  Well, make them walk.  Make them walk.  What if I wow the crowd?  Can I wow them?  She wants to know if she can wow the crowd. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah, she can do that.  Yeah, sure.  Is there a lot of people around?  Yeah.  Well, yeah, we definitely have a lot of people just standing around watching us.  All right.  All right.  So, Helena, when you're ready, everybody pay attention.  Watch this.  He's got big, huge cans.  Woo!  Whee!  And I hear scurrying coming.  Guys, after today's recap, I'm, uh, I gotta go.  Bye.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Oh, my God. 
[02:33:00]  If Rick gets arrested today, I gotta go.  Goodbye.  This is legal, isn't it?  This is legal, isn't it?  Oh, my God.  If Rick just got arrested right after she flashed here on the one-year anniversary of the Voyager  Bus.  That was priceless.  Oh, my God.  That might have saved the pit right there.  It might have saved it.  If she wound up getting Rick arrested, she wins. 
[02:33:30]  That's a great trick.  All right.  We'll be back, and we'll check in with Rick, and we'll see what's going on down there.  Yeah.  All right.  Stay there.  O.P. and Anthony.  All right.  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony show.  All right.  Waiting to hear from Rick.  Helena was in the middle of Times Square with her, uh, wild bumper sticker bikini.  She decided to flash the huge crowd down there, all the people, uh, shopping. 
[02:34:00]  Next thing we know, we hear, uh, pretty loud sirens.  Yep.  And Rick said, I have to go, and he hung up.  Yeah.  And, well, we're waiting to see where Rick is.  He hasn't called back yet, Anthony.  Uh-oh.  I think it's obvious who won the, uh, Britney Spears contest, right?  Yeah.  If Helena makes it back from Times Square with Rick, she will be the runner-up.  Right.  And she will receive a Samsung DVD player. 
[02:34:30]  And if she doesn't make her way back, um, she'll win a bologna sandwich.  That's right.  At least Rick could show her the ropes.  Yeah.  Until they split them up.  Uh, Andrew from Jersey.  I learned today not to kiss 19-year-old girls named Erin.  Mm-hmm.  One-Eyed Jack writes, uh, I learned the stalker chicks always like Opie.  Uh, I learned to always fly Southwest Airlines from now on.  The Voyeur bus got a bigger send-off than the Titanic. 
[02:35:00]  Uh, the...  Sorry.  I am really tired.  The Voyeur bus got a bigger send-off than the Titanic.  Yeah.  On a spinkter factor of 1 to 10, Voyeur bus incident equals 26.  3 a.m. ring and run.  Always funny.  And the only thing better than a rave party is a teen rave party.  Teen rave pajama party, right?  Coming soon to the Opie and Anthony show with Crystal Method.  Crystal Method spinning.  Jersey Gary's got some really good ones today.  I learned on the ONA show, when it comes to mayors, ONA, never learn. 
[02:35:30]  Happy first anniversary to, I have a Bundy crime scene in my pants, Jim Norton.  Neurotic, now my career is in the toilet, Louis Black.  I have to find a stash for my weed, Psycho Mark.  This is legal, isn't it, Rick?  And try to figure out my website, Steve C.  But not that CNN whore.  Uh, your mistress doesn't kiss your kids on the lips.  You also learned cabbies are sporting Mr. Softy hairdos.  Yeah.  Hey, about that whole mayor thing that we never learn with the mayor.  You know, Mike Bloomberg has been elected mayor. 
[02:36:00]  He's the mayor-elect.  And in January, he will take office as the mayor of New York City.  I believe this program is looking at him like the substitute teacher that came in for Giuliani,  who we considered the teacher.  So all we can say is, um, I think at some point we're going to see how far we can go with this,  gentlemen.  Oh, man, you're crazy.  What?  He seems like a guy with a little bit of a sense of humor. 
[02:36:30]  Mike Bloomberg, doesn't he?  After Giuliani, come on.  We'll have to wait.  The guy who has a regular hard-on the whole, uh, term there.  Still no word from Rick.  Uh, F-Tard, Mike from the Bronx.  Today I learned Jim Norton became a made man one year ago today.  That's kind of true.  Anthony, I learned it's beautiful when we all can hate.  Yeah.  It truly is.  All right.  Uh, F-Tard, Mike, again.  I learned today, Carlos Mencia, always funny. 
[02:37:00]  There are so many theories on the voyeur bus that Oliver Stone is planning a movie.  Stalker Patty is an endless source of disgusting radio.  Yes.  Let's bring her in here.  She's the winner of the Mommy, What Would You Do for Britney Spears?  She's got tickets, a limo ride, and spending money, and free.  Hoof and mouth disease.  Free dinner on, uh, Joey.  From Paisano's Mulberry Street.  Erin, congratulations.  Thank you.  I'm thinking Encore myself.  No.  No, she is not doing that again, right? 
[02:37:30]  No, no, no.  Has the taste left your mouth yet?  No.  No, huh?  No.  What does it taste like in there?  It's like stale chips or something.  Oh.  Like, it's just, like, nasty, and you can smell it as you were doing it.  It was just gross.  You know what we should make her eat at Joey's?  Big gnocchi with cheese sauce.  Oh, God.  Hey, Lisa, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned that Stalker Patty's toes could be one of the rounds on Celebrity Fear Factor.  Oh, man, can you imagine? 
[02:38:00]  That's the show I would tune in to see.  People sucking on Stalker Patty's toes.  I'd like to see Kelly Preston try that instead, and she'll take the worms and John Travolta any day.  All right.  Very good.  Thank you, Lisa.  Take care, guys.  All right.  Uncle John has a good one.  Uncle John.  Hey, guys.  Hey, does anybody warn Aronich you might get Tomein poisoning?  Tomein, yeah.  Something might happen.  Hey, you know what I learned today, guys?  Huh?  I learned that people will call in before saying, I hear dead beetles. 
[02:38:30]  Later, guys.  All right, bro.  Thank you.  Dave, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  I learned that the date November 30th is like Rick's personal September 11th.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  We still haven't heard from Rick.  I hope he's okay.  He's a tool.  I'm assuming he's going to be okay, though.  I hope so.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  And Helena's husband's outside the studio.  Ah.  Patiently waiting for her to get back. 
[02:39:00]  Tom, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  I learned two things on this show today.  Yeah.  One is that a racers named Patty communicate by tapping their toes.  Yeah.  And the other is you can walk around topless in New York, but you can't flash boots.  I guess.  Well, I think he's going to be okay.  That I don't understand, though.  All right, Tom.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Take it easy.  Maybe it's that whole disturbance thing again, Anthony.  I don't know.  David, what's up?  Hello.  Hey, David.  What do you have? 
[02:39:30]  Yeah, I learned that a soccer paddy has curves, like parallel lines.  And no, Opie wasn't playing a Ramone album.  Very good, man.  Thanks, guys.  You guys rock, man.  All right, bro.  Bye.  Let's go to Jerry.  Jerry, what's up?  Yes, I'm calling from Kent, Washington.  And because your show wasn't syndicated when the flasher, the warrior bus incident went  down, I learned the whole story of what happened that day. 
[02:40:00]  Oh, there you go.  Cool.  I hope that was entertaining to someone out there.  Yeah, it is.  Thank you, Jerry.  Yep.  All right, bye.  I learned that Listerine will not kill the S on Patty's toes, and no matter how sick  it was, you guys were still looking at her technique.  Yeah, he's absolutely right.  Aaron, you have nice technique.  That's Chris from Cleveland.  That's what I learned today.  Aaron has nice technique.  All right, well, Aaron won the tickets.  She's had it long enough to practice it.  Yeah.  You little dirty girl, you. 
[02:40:30]  She's a cute girl, too.  Enjoy the Britney Spears show, all right?  Thank you.  Well, we kind of salvaged the contest, sort of, Anthony.  Yeah, well, it was disgusting and entertaining all at one.  And Steve learned the best place to get Rick's autograph is Central Booking.  Where is Rick?  Is he trying to pull a wacky gag or something, or is he, uh...  I don't know.  Rick, just call us and tell us you're okay so we can get off the air.  Skier, what's up? 
[02:41:00]  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I learned you could do bumps off Patty's toenails.  We did learn that.  Thanks, Skier.  I'm going to eat for it.  All right, thank you.  Hey, Rick!  Rick's back.  Is he here?  Okay.  Hey, Rick, what happened?  What happened?  Your mother effers almost got me twice.  What happened?  Jesus.  That was hilarious.  I'm here.  What happened?  She flashed, and all we heard were police sirens on this end.  We heard that...  Two cars came swooping around 44th Street, pulling up just beyond the crowd, so the crowd 
[02:41:30]  kind of blocked the cops from seeing us, and then all of a sudden, guys on horseback come  running over.  Uh-oh.  That's when I ditched the phone, and we just, like, ran across...  We ran through traffic, cut across.  She almost knocked some old lady over who had a bag, and we jumped in the first cab we  saw.  Wow.  Well, thanks, Elena.  Well, good.  Well, at least the cops don't know where to find you now. 
[02:42:00]  That's good, Rick.  That's great.  Come right home.  That's where they always get them.  They always go home.  You're the runner-up.  You're going to win a Samsung DVD player.  Yeah.  I hope you enjoy that.  Bravo.  Great job.  All right.  Well, we've got to get out of here, Anthony.  Yeah.  We're leaving for Boston.  Drive 100.  We're leaving for Boston in a few minutes.  We were talking...  If you drive 100 miles an hour, it'll only take you two hours.  But I prefer...  If you do 200 miles an hour, Opie, it will only take you one hour. 
[02:42:30]  One hour of the most intense driving of your life.  That's a hell of a ride, man.  A 200-mile drive in an hour.  Can you imagine?  You'd have to be screaming at the top of your lungs the whole time.  Oh, my God!  I'm going to die!  That should be...  But I'm making great time!  That should be 15 minutes into it, knowing you have 45 minutes to go.  You know how long that 15 minutes would take if you're driving 200 miles an hour, and you  would still have 45 minutes of your trip left at 200 miles an hour?  Very scary, frightening drive. 
[02:43:00]  All right.  We're looking forward to tomorrow.  We're going to be signing some naked discs up there in Boston.  Yes.  Check it out up there in Boston.  A compilation CD with all the R's you know and love, and a bit from Stephen Lynch and  a bit from us, and it's going to be cool.  We're going to check out some old faces and hopefully some new faces in Boston tomorrow  when we go to Newberry Comics in Natick on Route 9.  I think it's at 1 o'clock tomorrow.  We're going to have a little party down there at the store, okay?  Right.  So thank you, guys.  Have a good weekend if we don't see you in Boston, and we'll be back on the radio Monday 
[02:43:30]  at Tree.  Okay.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace. </pre>
