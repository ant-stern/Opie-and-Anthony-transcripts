<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, frequently employing vulgar and offensive language.  The show began with a frustrated discussion about the upcoming "Unmasked" event with Ron Bennington.  Opie and Anthony complained about an inaccurate press release advertising the event, listing unconfirmed celebrities like Louis C.K., Seth Rogen, Bob Newhart, and Sandra Bernhard, and misrepresenting the event's length and ticket availability.  They debated the venue ("Crumbs" vs. "Magnolias") and Opie's weight loss struggles.  A substantial portion focused on listener calls about Obamacare, with callers sharing both positive and negative experiences, leading to a debate on the Affordable Care Act's impact, touching upon military suicide rates and the cost of the Afghanistan war.  The segment concluded with brief discussions of Jack White's new music, a past studio visit anecdote, and Sam Roberts' insider knowledge of the "Unmasked" event.

The next segment featured a discussion of Sam Roberts' interview with Billy Dee Williams, focusing on Williams' performance on *Dancing with the Stars*,  his age, and his personal life, all discussed with crude and offensive language.  This transitioned into a debate about Mike Francesa's stance on paternity leave for baseball players, with callers, including Francesa himself, participating.  The conversation then shifted to a critical discussion of American politics, taxation, government overreach, and perceived freedoms lost, with callers engaging in heated debates, often using offensive language.  Discussions included Obamacare, church tax exemptions, and the hosts' experiences with tax evasion, culminating in a contentious debate with a caller identifying as a wealthy small business owner about wealth, taxes, and hypocrisy.

The broadcast continued with a discussion contrasting negative stereotypes of the wealthy and welfare recipients. Opie discussed his family's pride in avoiding welfare, while Anthony shared anecdotes about his mother's multiple jobs.  This led to a broader critique of the US welfare system and wealth distribution, including a listener suggestion for more visible tax deductions.  The conversation then shifted to sports, focusing on the Yankees, Red Sox, and Islanders.  Studio guest Nick DiPaolo promoted his upcoming shows, and the conversation moved to a Patrice O'Neal benefit show, followed by a critical discussion of Nicolas Cage's acting in *Face/Off*, with a brief mention of Joaquin Phoenix.  A significant portion involved humorous, offensive commentary on a video of people barbecuing in a shopping cart, incorporating racial slurs and stereotypes.  This sparked a discussion on freedom of speech, online anonymity, and the consequences of expressing controversial opinions, referencing "N-Mania.com".  A retired NYPD officer called in to discuss a colleague's disciplinary action for posting "filth" on Facebook, further fueling the debate on freedom of speech.

The final segment centered on political correctness and freedom of speech, triggered by a caller's anecdote about workplace language restrictions.  The hosts and callers debated the origins of political correctness, referencing Andrew Dice Clay, and discussed its perceived impact on white heterosexual males.  The conversation frequently used offensive language, including racial slurs and homophobic epithets.  Nick DiPaolo remained a studio guest throughout this segment.  A heated exchange occurred with a caller identifying as a liberal, and the segment concluded with a brief discussion of a staff member, Roland, and his interactions with interns.  Throughout the entire broadcast, the hosts and callers frequently used offensive language and engaged in controversial discussions.

[00:00:30]  then everything else logistically that surrounds it right is just another catastrophe well i mean  the fact is we don't we don't run our own channel we almost did back in the day we don't run this  place we have amazing ideas we know what the fuck we're doing but for some reason no one wants to  listen to us no i mean the the demand for the unmasked is so huge we want to move it to a  bigger venue to a better time but i understand i can even we wanted we wanted to talk longer because 
[00:01:00]  one hour with ron bennington is going to go by like that why and now we're hearing this like  celebrities involved like we we said no to the cupcake thing obviously we went off on that the  other day yeah now there's a press release we don't even know what it means because we're not  in on the we're not in on the in the loop no one even ran the press release by us first to say hey  here's what a whole bunch of celebrities showing up as we try to talk for one hour i don't know 
[00:01:30]  sam roberts the the the nosy busy body of the station sam roberts he knows something he's sniffing  the press release was released and we're reading it and i don't know what it means yeah are those  celebrities showing up sam roberts comment please i think i i saw i think oh we started with i think  was that the press release i think i know where the plane is i think i saw some debris what happened  enough about the plane was that what the press release was or is that what that website just 
[00:02:00]  put up yeah are you talking about the article that that website put up or the press release i don't  know okay because i think i don't know the thing that kenny sent out yes i don't think anyone sent  me a copy of the press release if they did i apologize but i don't remember seeing it i got  an email from kenny that looks pretty official but did you get an actual press release no the press  release was released to the company i got it in my email what's it say chavis i never got it is it  the one with the celebrity list yeah i know what the celebrity list is what is it uh other people that 
[00:02:30]  ronnie has talked to that's all it is well then it's it's not worded that way it is completely  worded like they are going to show up at our event i know and i think that that's whose poor  fucking uh writing was that about.com but about.com wrote that that's not us no yeah this is is it the  actual press release or are they because it says besides ona and sidekick which is stupid that's  fine sidekick is a horrendous word in radio it's true but it fits coattail rider's more accurate but 
[00:03:00]  i'll take sidekick that's how i used to perform abortions good sidekick  it should be it should be and funny man and funny man but sidekick is just a hack radio term  jim norton's not a sidekick blowing guys occasionally that's a sidekick  besides ona and sidekick jim norton a lineup of guests include louis ck seth rogan bob newhart and  sandra bernhardt i don't want sandra bernhardt uh associated with anything we do by the way we've 
[00:03:30]  never talked to her in our lives in our lives why do they add her to that well why is it she's a huge  howard guest and that's fine so why is she even in there was that in the official press release  no no okay all right all right all right fair enough yeah putter chair that the article is  this is this guy's problem right he the press release says unmasked is an informal interactive 
[00:04:00]  and uncensored comedy series right featuring extended in-depth conversations with superstars  and emerging names in comedy hosted by ron beddington the series has featured guests including  louis ck seth rogan bob all right but that's not what i saw that's because serious has i just saw  this clipped version which sounds like uh you know right but that's just so what was it cory deets  cory deets idiot deets nuts go back to the press release what's the quote they used because they 
[00:04:30]  asked me and anthony for quotes we we goofed on the whole thing we came up with some i thought funny  quotes for this thing hey why not what's the official quote um we want to is that it the only  thing we have to fear yeah all right the quote in this press release is we want to toast opie and anthony  on reaching the milestones and in being one of the most outrageous and daring duos in all of talk radio  right sirius xm has been proud to give opie and anthony the freedom to give fans and listeners their 
[00:05:00]  intense edgy talk and uncensored comedy said scott greenstein president and chief content officer  at sirius xm there's a chief content officer we are thrilled to have sirius xm listeners across  the country celebrate their decades in radio with an evening that will be without a doubt an outrageous  and unpredictable show that's not a bad that's not a bad quote i gotta say from a company president 
[00:05:30]  worse that's not a bad quote could be worse yeah that's not about you yeah celebrity thing is just  some guy yeah writing an article for radio dot about dot com believe i would love it to be a douchey  quote but that's actually not bad so the guy from about is an idiot but my problem is our our quotes  were pushed out well they weren't good enough for you although i'll say this it's always better to have  someone say something good about you than you about you that's what i love saying things about me  my but you're a rare exception my quote was um we ran out of things to talk about years ago 
[00:06:00]  let's get this crap over with oh shit that was probably not one for the pressure but that would  be funny in a press release and that answer was just as good with a yada yada yada at the end yeah i  was like et cetera et cetera finish it up yeah i think i think that the people why not why does it  have to be like uh i understand what you mean but i'm officially team serious on the quote  oh they were right it might not read as well in print i just don't want yada yada yada and he said 
[00:06:30]  we're done they don't seem to really give a shit i just don't want the guy that promised us a lot  and never came through once by the way to be part of our press release which which person is that  there's a few but i mean you know that's his position with the company and i guess he has to be  in every press release but he's done nothing for for us so it's a little bothersome yeah i think the  people putting together the event anyway no matter how hard you guys are trying to fight it want to  make you seem like stars yeah that's fine i don't uh but i think but that one guy has made it extremely 
[00:07:00]  hard to do this you know that right there's enough going on he knows that at this point enough going on  with this where we don't need to spice it up just a nice fucking good interview with ronnie  fans there caroline i like it if we want to do something else in the future that that is a bigger  event let's just do it we it's not a one or the other or let's combine the two things let's just have

[00:11:00]  that's an isolated part of the world too and there's junk in that that part of the ocean junk  yeah all right so uh unmasked happens two weeks from today how do people get tickets i don't know  apparently they think how you get tickets is to tweet us and ask for tickets because boy do a lot of  people tweet me and say could you hook me up and now there are a few people i will hook up but they  are like close friends and family right just some guy from fucking denver going hey anthony could you

[00:12:00]  yeah fort hood turns out the guy has some uh emotional issues right yeah this is a slight  you know relief that it wasn't you know a terrorist act well the last one wasn't terrorism either it was  work workplace violence right that's what the um that's what the president said and did you tell me  just a few minutes ago before the show that there are 22 suicides a day yeah so is that really true  22 soldiers kill themselves every day in this country it's uh it comes from this over a decade 
[00:12:30]  long deployment and and it there's no real solution when these guys come home right uh it's i guess  they're expected to do what they do and this has been the military over the years this is just the way  it is and it's sad they they deploy they see horrible things they do horrible things they come back and it's  just like all right that part of your life is over thank you for your service and then they're just 
[00:13:00]  supposed to go you know be a roofer carpenter or whatever and function normally when at night they're  just waking up screaming fucking sweating having anxiety attacks uh uh depression and they're killing  themselves at an unprecedented rate and some of these guys aren't just taking themselves out  they're doing what this guy did right he was deployed in 2011 he comes back he's uh he's being  treated for emotional uh and behavioral problems and um he just snaps goes in there shoots up some people 
[00:13:30]  and then kills himself it's one of these little dirty secrets a lot of the um untold shit that goes on  with uh with warfare and it's been that way forever and then we spend shit loads of money on the  countries that we were fighting in well the vice uh vice did a great little um uh special on  their hbo series on afghanistan and how we're rebuilding afghanistan yeah and people people in  the know saying what a waste of uh refunds uh refunds uh what a waste of funds wow what's wrong 
[00:14:00]  we think i'm still tired we think there's this uh just spending way too much money in you and then  these soldiers aren't getting the proper care when they come back to yeah to the states they're getting  more than enough oh jimmy norton that's right now i quoted somewhere  it's uh they think that that just pouring money into the country that we we fought in is the way  that kind of you end the war you know but unless there's a solution an absolute solution like look 
[00:14:30]  at japan and germany they were conquered they fucking surrendered it was pretty much you do what we say  and then you go in and rebuild the infrastructure so that they can start from zero right and and with  with the cooperation of of the other countries the allied countries and you build it back up this  isn't the case there's still a lot of bad people and bad things going on in afghanistan yeah the 
[00:15:00]  taliban you know they're returning there you go right on msbc what's going to happen when we  completely exit so when you start pumping money into a job that's not done yet um or or even a  job you know that might not shouldn't have been done in the first place whatever however you want  to look at it it doesn't work well my point is simple i mean we're spending all this money to  rebuild afghanistan when we got soldiers coming home that need you know special care yep and we've  done this break many times over the last few years and and we'll i'm sure the soldiers are calling right 
[00:15:30]  now yeah they're fucked up they'll divert it to guns though or something they'll say oh look the  availability of guns we can't the availability of crazy people is the problem there's a lot of crazy  people out there that uh are going to get their hands on whatever it takes to to do harm to other  people sure what's uh they need to be we got an obamacare uh person on the line oh you know that agatha  broad on twitter why doesn't she ever call the show she says she tries to call and no one ever 
[00:16:00]  puts her that's a complete and utter lie she calls people on twitter that goes at it hard with that  she tries to go at it with me and i just say i'm not interested sorry but uh and a lot of people are  asking her why doesn't she call the radio show because she has a lot of strong opinions on twitter  and she's lying if she says that she has tried to call this radio show we put everyone through i  think she's a troll actually i don't think it's a black woman no i think she's for real you really 
[00:16:30]  yeah over the over the year years almost that it's been um i i think she's legit she she i've seen  pictures you and her have been going at it for a couple years now and it's like you're trying to  tell me she hasn't been able to get through once to our show she's lying and i want to make that point  today but um it's because we have wide open phones right now call the show she calls me out  calls me a liar this that and then i back things up with documentation from legitimate sources just  the other day she said something about i said something about um uh the obesity rate of black 
[00:17:00]  women and she jumps on me oh the more obese white people and then i took uh from from a website that  is it was black health a black health website and it said that that the percentage of black  obese women far out numbers and then she just stops commenting on it and never if she gives her own  um uh stats on anything she just says you're a liar well hopefully she'll call the show but she's lying  if she if she's saying that she has tried and no one picks up her phone call that's ridiculous 
[00:17:30]  people ask me why i even argue with her on there she's an end to a means uh for me she a means to an  she uh like i can bounce things off of her that i wouldn't be able to just chatting with uh regular  uh right old white people by the way it's like a robin quivers uh thing by the way i'm a little  annoyed today oh uh because i got my insurance cancellations congrats so and i wondered why it 
[00:18:00]  took so long because i heard you talking about it yeah so i gotta like everyone else i have to pick  all new plans because what i had wasn't good enough so and i got kids and and and the wife  that needed all that stuff so well i i i don't were you happy with your other insurance there was no  issue well then you could keep oh that's right you can't and then like you were saying the other day  with the paperwork i don't even know where to begin that fucking paperwork did you get the one the big 
[00:18:30]  white envelope yes yeah that's the one i got and i'm educated so i can't imagine people that  aren't educated what the fuck is going on they're just going to be on insurance they're going to lose  their insurance i have no fucking idea how to even attempt this i was and i don't know where to  begin yeah and i think they do that on purpose for whatever reason did the papers came in yesterday  i started looking through it and then i'm like all right i think i could do this i think i kind of  know what they're talking about as far as the the premium right the um the copay all that stuff goes  and then it turned to you must include your corporate tax form number and i'm like hey i don't 
[00:19:00]  know because now this obamacare thing it's also an irs issue it's tied in with the internal revenue  service so you need to supply tax documentation for your fucking insurance i don't know why we're not  having a revolution we should it's ridiculous we're revolting but it's well it's one of those  things you get into a little bit like okay all right okay i'm good all right my training  with all right let's figure this out and then something happens where your brain you you feel 
[00:19:30]  it explode god and you're done you haven't and then you put it back in the envelope and i'm shipping  it off to bob i don't know what to do with it i was i was fighting an imaginary person in my apartment  again it gets to the point where you just start fighting punching just punching the air and kicking  and screaming and terrible it's so confusing i'm sorry are you guys getting it through your company  though you have a corporation together yeah no no not together but i mean through your corporation  yes through my separate corporation that's probably why it wants your tax information because you're 
[00:20:00]  using the corporation no no even with the individual ones they want your tax note uh information because  if you don't pay for it then they penalize you through your i don't know tax uh i don't know but  i had i i for the first time in my life i had perfect health insurance i know me too i i went  most of my life with having either no insurance i had no health insurance easily up into my 30s we  didn't have health insurance when we were in boston nope and then uh and then had shitty health 
[00:20:30]  insurance when radio stations finally started offering it they didn't even offer it if you were  in this business yeah and then finally after all these years i have perfect health insurance and now i  have to redo the whole thing that's ridiculous you're lying though because this didn't happen  to anybody this is all lies that the republicans uh are throwing out there to make it seem like  no people by the millions are having their insurance policies canceled but what but mine was fine  i i guess not that was a illegal insurance policy you have it's just another thing that i just don't 
[00:21:00]  want to deal with that's the big thing i was thinking about that yesterday like every day and i i  believe i talk for the majority every day there's another call coming in saying hey can you meet  next week for this and then there's another call hey we need you to stop by for this and then you've  got to squeeze maybe a dentist appointment in there and you realize your life is just filled with 
[00:21:30]  making appointments making appointments and tasks that you have no desire to do that's why i always  say no to everything that's why i don't take phone calls from any of these people around here because  it's just another hour or two that i'm wasting on nonsense and then here's a couple of envelopes i  have that kenny's got to send out for me today uh new york state department of finance there's two  checks right for thousands of dollars right that i gotta be honest i don't even know what the fuck 
[00:22:00]  they're for no i don't know but you gotta pay them yeah it has some weird like a blah blah it's not  my taxes it's slash it's a thing for the privilege of just standing here in the wonderful city of new  york you got city sucks it's not that special in the end the hands that are rummaging through  people's pockets just pulling cash out uh it's gotten ridiculous and everyone goes you know you give a  little more and it'll help but but if a thousand people are taking a little more it turns into a lot 
[00:22:30]  more that's what people don't understand but and the people that are saying you got to do your fair  share have no fucking clue what people in a higher tax bracket are giving oh shut up fuck you let me  come over and take more than half of your money see how you feel about it i don't know if my insurance  is good i don't know i i'm after so i don't know if that's after it was pretty good when i had it i  remember that like that i would know if the policy change they just kind of change it right i don't 
[00:23:00]  yeah i think they should take care of it i don't think you have a problem with after and and by the  way uh more do we more people just call and saying their insurance was canceled yeah we could do this  for weeks why why would people because they don't because they can't fucking grasp that obama lied to  the american people when he said you could keep your insurance uh so and they want to think that  the when he crowed about seven million people uh being insured it wasn't seven million uninsured 
[00:23:30]  people it was fucking six million people that had insurance and one million people that are uh  subsidized so what the fuck who's signing up for this shit also we need young people young uh  people to sign up for the uh obamacare they're under their parents plan until 26 right who the  fuck is going to sign up if you're already insured under your parents the basics here obamacare is 
[00:24:00]  giving a lot of people insurance that never had insurance before that's what it was supposed to do but  it's but it's hurting a lot of other people right get that done so you're just shifting the people  you're hurting really and i said it before i mark my words there are going to be people  that get confused by all this paperwork by the cancellations of policies they don't look at  shit they don't and they are going to wind up going to the hospital with some catastrophic illness  and and they are going to say i'm sorry you're not insured and they're going to go what happened  oh it was canceled and you never re-upped for insurance the paperwork was so confusing to me 
[00:24:30]  at first glance that i'm sitting there going they want this to be confusing because i think part of  it is to penalize people as well yes because that's you know that's just another way to bring  in money this is how they do things as i like to say another revenue stream yeah they get people to  fall through the cracks and those are the people that really get fucked over and then they could  penalize them for not having insurance my it's same thing with like the gun registration thing i'm 
[00:25:00]  supposed to register my assault weapons uh this month and uh a lot of people don't know this  it's a law that's like what i'm supposed to what and then when they don't do it then they're not  compliant with the law and then they'll have a gun charge on their thing and never be able to  have a gun again mission accomplished we're not taking your guns yeah you are you are they're just  sneaky the government is just sneaky but just sneaky petes uh let's say hi to derrick in the 
[00:25:30]  bronx he wants to ask you a couple questions about obamacare oh hi go ahead derrick how are you  hey what's up phelps how you doing okay jimmy what's up hey buddy hi what's going on uh dude i was just  watching like uh old like reruns of your show and stuff and man you were dead right dude this is like  fucking ridiculous i can't believe it bro but um yeah i know people have said that i haven't listened to  clips but uh they said that i was i was saying some shit back when obama first got elected and it 
[00:26:00]  was like exactly what's going on now with obama care it was like fortune teller i don't know i'm  amazing what can i tell you i work for a union man and uh just last week they cut i think it was  like something like 75 to 80 percent of uh the staff just a part-time everybody so i have to pay yeah  yeah part-time employees is the wave of the future good job this is what your employer is doing  because they can't afford this shit so it's costing people their jobs or or it's certainly  costing them hours yeah i can't believe it though dude and keep preaching man you're dead right 
[00:26:30]  uh yeah i try my friend always take care hope you're the man all right sorry thank you brother  bye jimmy norton like derrick he said it went right around the table i never listened to jimmy  one uh let's see kevin in jersey kevin go ahead buddy i just think that uh anthony's perspective  and your feigned ignorance opie just kind of feed into the kind of ignorance that the right wing 
[00:27:00]  hopes would be exposed by uh you know the affordable care act and it's in and you know it's  involvement it's uh you know kind of exposing so you're buying the seven million number you're  buying the fact that a lot of uninsured people are now insured you know that you realize there's  over 300 million people in this country right you realize even if it was seven million that that's a 
[00:27:30]  drop in the proverbial bucket i buy the number because i don't believe in the kind of like  unskewed polls that uh you know uh last election cycle a lot of the right wing people  right wing people oh boy first of all i am not a right winger by any stretch of the imagination  you get your information from some of those people but i know i get my information from 
[00:28:00]  everywhere that's something people don't understand when they say i'm just regurgitating fox news  that is dishonest it's a cop-out in any argument with me i get my information from a lot of different  sources i go on every type of website from from the mainstream media to radical left and radical  right websites and i gather up as much info as i can and opinions that people have and that's how i base  my uh opinion and and gather my facts up when i go to debate somebody i do too anthony well just to 
[00:28:30]  say that i'm a right winger and i'm regurgitating fox news is a complete cop-out it's like when a  black person calls me a racist so for uh having an honest debate with the with them so why don't you  educate us because we're obviously wrong kevin go ahead i'm just saying all these phone calls we get  every day with people being affected by obamacare they're all lying too the fact that my brother  can't um i shouldn't have said it well i said a family member yesterday but i have a brother that 
[00:29:00]  can't afford his medication anymore because of obamacare that that's just a lie the intern that  came in here yesterday he can't afford some shit that's a lie too it was all lies they were called  liars yesterday on twitter i saw that and we do take uh calls uh from people that you know are for  obamacare yeah as well but it's overwhelmingly the other way right now oh maybe it's our audience i don't  know all i was saying is that anthony was doubting the seven million figure yeah which is the kind of uh parlance of people who were doubting uh you know the figures of the election results last cycle no no no it's it's different than 
[00:29:30]  the election results it's you you are you telling me that you don't believe a large number of those people were people that lost their insurance policy because didn't adhere to the legislation and that's why the numbers are so high because they had to get re-insure themselves and they're adding that into the number that's dishonest it's not an honest assessment of how many people actually signed up the uninsured people that signed up for this and all of a sudden now they have insurance 
[00:30:00]  of uninsured people that did not have insurance that signed up for obamacare and now have insurance give me those fucking numbers don't include in the medicaid and medicare numbers don't include the people that had insurance had it canceled and had to sign up again i want honest fucking numbers and the white house will not give those numbers out it's infuriating and dishonest transparent the most transparent administration 
[00:30:30]  explain to me why i have to change my insurance i was responsible and got solid health insurance for me my family and uh my employees me and i actually have employees as well so explain to me why i have to change all my insurance that i set up properly a long time ago sure i will say it's about 1.7 million people who had to uh you know again quote unquote lose their insurance and had to get on the new insurance it was more sir 
[00:31:00]  and why am i one of those people because what did i do wrong i would love to know no one did anything wrong that's uh you know what i would say is because uh you know it's unfair to the people who have those expenses you know who have maternity expenses and such like that who had to pay more because they were women because they had you know families because they had 
[00:31:30]  well wait do you really think that everyone should be the problem is you can't tell people who don't need that stuff to pay for it it's silly sir that's really unreasonable to ask me or oprah and to pay for somebody else's whatever they have  but my point is i'm paying for all that already but i know but that's already part of my insurance so why is someone like me why do i have to change my insurance that's like saying it's unfair that men have prostates and can get prostate cancer and 
[00:32:00]  have to you know the insurance companies have to pay for that and you have to pay more premiums if you're a man because of that why don't the women kick in it's like yeah pregnancy  for the most part well the way it's supposed to work is you're supposed to be a man and a woman she gets pregnant you have insurance it takes care of it  and if you are a smart guy and you know you're probably planning a family or maybe your wife is in the age bracket where she can get pregnant then you uh uh get your insurance accordingly 
[00:32:30]  because you have the freedom to make the choices that are best for you and your family and that would be uh getting maternity care for your family or yourself uh or what have you  me on the other hand a single guy um in in in my fucking early 50s thank you uh i don't fucking need maternity care or orthodontia for children  why the fuck is the president and this administration forcing me to buy a certain kind of insurance that i don't feel i need 
[00:33:00]  comment because oh you know a woman not at your advanced age anthony you know but in her 40s perhaps  who still needs contraception for her you know cycle i don't know the specifics about oh boy contraception we all  know the ladies like uh use an abortion for that yes we're just swallowing i'm saying for their cycle 
[00:33:30]  contraceptive quote unquote drugs are used for a lot of women for just to you know maintain their cycle  to yeah what are you getting at all right but aunt doesn't have to do that so why does he have to add  all that to the question hold on the question was simple though why does anthony have to pay for that why  don't i have the freedom to buy what i feel is best for me why should a woman who is not 52 as anthony 
[00:34:00]  or whatever oh forget it dude you can't you can't debate anything because then she could have the  freedom to buy what she needs exactly or if she can't afford it i'm sorry that's up to the government  to figure out without making us add more shit onto our stuff that we're never going to use so someone  else could could have affordable health insurance that's crazy the whole idea of the law is a  generalization where everyone starts to pay more equal and again that's a phrase that that might not 
[00:34:30]  be what you guys want to hear but it's like it's equalizing the field so everyone rising the field i want  as an american as an american citizen i want the right and freedom to determine what is best for me and my  loved ones period i don't want the government shoving their fucking nose in my asshole in every aspect  of how i live my life and how i treat myself and my family and what i feel i should purchase to make my 
[00:35:00]  life better or worse or what have you but you know as in car insurance you can't do that you can't say  i yeah and i have the option to not have a car how about that i don't have to the government isn't  mandating me to get a car and buy insurance or penalize me that's that's the fact of the matter  and if someone's too poor to buy fucking insurance i don't have to subsidize their  fucking insurance and driving is a privilege get the money from somewhere else right 
[00:35:30]  it's obvious the government wastes money every single day get it from somewhere else  instead of making uh people pay more how about that point and just made a car insurance that was a  great point everyone brings up the car insurance point when they're talking about this type of  insurance and how car insurance is mandatory and shit yet if you have a car it's a luxury having a  fucking car but you are a person so that's been debated all right you let's end on a little chuckle 
[00:36:00]  okay yeah all right kevin yeah fucking lip cock second all right nothing i didn't say a word all  right kevin we gave you your time thank you all right all right here's a guy see we do take calls  a guy we do take calls from both sides certainly have always tried to do that over the years we're  fair and balanced well i made that up we try but people just uh go on twitter and call us liars yeah  uh mike in michigan go ahead mike hey how you doing hey buddy um i've always had insurance you know 
[00:36:30]  we've we've my wife and i have always been self-employed she's uh she's a mobile dog groomer  and i deliver trucks for a living so of course we're rolling in the dough we've always paid our own  insurance uh it's constantly raised every year not by a small amount but by like a hundred dollars 
[00:37:00]  a year so we're up to where we're paying about eight hundred and fifty dollars a year just for two  people uh the wife says oh my god uh they're canceling our policy and i said great because it  ain't worth a fuck anyway and uh so i went on the obama website and the first time it was a a little  shaky back in october so i went back around december big bang boom uh my insurance for very similar well 
[00:37:30]  actually better coverage went went from 850 dollars a month to 436 dollars a month and that's the top  plan we were able to even add vision and dental at that price well you have to have some kind of uh 
[00:38:00]  children's orthodontia no that's great that's great and and the uh the deductible the deductible  was the same and the co-pay for uh doctor office visits and hospital yeah very similar right you  know when i went to the pharmacy i thought i keep thinking oh there's always some catch  that's gonna screw you you know i'm waiting for the catch but prescription prices are the same  well the the the difference here is we're not going to call you a liar  uh with with with your with what happened to you uh and your policy uh congratulations that sounds 
[00:38:30]  great but i'll tell you one thing i've heard a lot more stories to the other end um and and and the  polls with people that are satisfied with this are really kind of saying people aren't satisfied with  it so um congrats it seems like you lucked out yeah i did you know and i spoke i discussed this with my  friend uh an independent car mechanic who who signed up for his thing and he sure is he said that i like 
[00:39:00]  the way you talk sound like a race corps i didn't hear that all right okay we got your point sir  unfortunately we have a lot of calls and we must be moving on but thank you for your call sir i think  the pain is dry thanks mike all right let's say hi to michelle in kentucky michelle hey what's going  on oh a chick we love when chicks call yeah yeah talk about your vagina yeah tell us about your cuda 
[00:39:30]  nice yeah um i just wanted to chime in real quick um i'm kind of in the same boat as you anthony i'm  i'm 41 and i i'm never going to have kids you know the decision um my fiance and i've made were just  not kid materials that being said i have no fucking interest in maternity care because i'm never going  to use it yeah same thing with the ordontia for yeah that's for kids the thing is uh they they need 
[00:40:00]  the people that can pay for it to pay for it even if you're not using it so that way it could go down  to the people that are subsidized that can't pay for it so once again this is a welfare based uh  system whereas the people that can afford it are going to pump in for shit they don't need to pay for  the people that uh can't afford it and and that's what you're paying for maternity first of all if you 
[00:40:30]  can't afford your own insurance you shouldn't be fucking having kids that's that you need pregnancy  care uh prenatal care and and pregnancy leave and fucking uh orthodontic you shouldn't even be  having your fucking little little leeches what's their point on this though well maybe you will need  this down the road is that what they're trying to say absolutely not it's completely ridiculous they're  making people do this they're saying that you are going to be paying the maternity care that you're  paying for in your insurance premiums are to pay for someone else's maternity care that's going to be 
[00:41:00]  uh subsidized and and and paid for that's why you're paying for it people don't make enough  money to fucking handle money out to people i like being charitable to people i know and care about  keep voting for your leaders they're great they're great they're wonderful real representative of what  we want aren't they um boy a perfect representation of their constituency i'm proud to say i don't vote  cocksuckers but if you don't vote yeah whatever then you don't have the right whatever i'm proud to 
[00:41:30]  say i don't vote for these idiots is that one of yours all dried up is that why you don't need it  bunch of shysters did you go through the change did you go through the change not yet still got some  moisture as who kid would say some moisture all right absolutely right one more thing that i want to  say about obamacare um my mother-in-law she's going through uh battling that bladder cancer right  now oh congrats oh no that's not okay no sorry sorry she's going to be fine she's no good trooper 
[00:42:00]  but anyway um a thing with obamacare they are not going to do a pet scan on her with obamacare you have  to have cancer twice they're only doing a ct scan to check you know to make sure you know to see how much  it's uh the tumors are shrunk see this is the flip side of it is is somebody can call up and say  that their benefits are their premiums went down and their their uh coverage is the same and that's 
[00:42:30]  all fine and dandy but when you dig deep and find out the restrictions that are put on uh the doctors  that you've had over the years and whatnot it just to me seems um that you're still getting uh it was  some type of shitty end of a stick yeah with this whole yeah that's the biggest point i wanted to  get across it's the freedom too yeah it's it's the freedom to do as you think is best for your  family that is being taken away from us by the day with uh and it's not just obama believe me i 
[00:43:00]  understand that over the years uh terrorism has been used as a a tool to take away personal freedoms  um and and the republicans are as guilty as the democrats when it comes to that uh but but how much  more are american people going to be choked out of their own life you can't do anything you know  we've talked about how you know you'd say we're the freest country in the world go out with a rifle  and shoot a rabbit in your neighborhood because you want to eat it tonight right you'll be thrown in  jail and that's a personal freedom that used to be available you can't even bring strawberries to 
[00:43:30]  the movie theater don't bring strawberries to a movie theater we'll get to that story in a little while  it we don't have these freedoms we we crow about how great this nation is and oh we're the freest  nation but year after year we don't realize how many of those freedoms are just taken away our  country's still pretty good but man we're just ruining it oh wrecking the whole year after year  we're just ruining it wrecking it with all running a good thing regulations and and representatives that  have no interest in what the people that voted them in want it's it's zero interest in what they're 
[00:44:00]  fucking the people they're supposed to represent are actually getting and their solution is always  to just try to get more money from us constantly more cash and then you see these stories like vice  did on hbo i i'd highly recommend you see the afghanistan one where we're rebuilding this country  people are admit openly admitting what a waste of time and money and how that money can be used uh  so i rebuild detroit how about we rebuild a couple of cities here in our own country imagine 
[00:44:30]  if you took all that money and figured out a new industry for detroit instead of throwing it  into afghanistan exactly i'm in total agreement with that my dad was in the gulf war the first  time around and his health is suffering because of that yeah yeah well thanks guys all right good  job michelle uh this guy went from 136 a month to 450 a month they just keep coming in here that's  great uh nice jump nice pay oh hey oh wait bill in boston go ahead well bill hey guys thank you 
[00:45:00]  for having this conversation even though our representatives aren't listening i appreciate it  exactly they are we're very popular with government officials yeah um mike um we have a small truck  repair business and our premiums just went down but the understanding that i have is that you have to  sign on to some fly-by-night insurance company that's new that is offering cheaper rates but they  who knows if they'll be offered next year when you have to renew yeah a lot of times they'll they'll 
[00:45:30]  throw your um they'll throw their clients to other companies like you'll be uh with uh some insurance  company and then they either go under or absorbed by somebody else or just off their clients to some  other thing it's like oh you are now covered by yeah and then it's this company and you're like what  the fuck just happened right and and and and they don't have to give you the same benefits that you're  getting under the first uh the company it's it's bizarre uh let me hang on tight everyone all right  thank you let's go to robert in birmingham he works for the insurance industry all over the place 
[00:46:00]  here so we try to take a variety of calls every morning all over the place go ahead robert yeah uh  yeah disclaimer i work in it at the larger largest insurer in my state uh and why did you hold  out why did you give that disclaimer it's like if the post covers something on fox well we have  declaimers that we're owned by news corp yeah by news corp no just just just so if you've gotten  up i wouldn't get uh get get jimmy's rant about uh about insurance uh going on and then get called 
[00:46:30]  oh you work for the insurance company so anyway i just want to say about what rants on insurance  i don't have a rant about insurance i like insurance insurance i'm a libertarian and i hate this  i hate the obamacare stuff but having said that you talked yesterday about this uh the pre-existing  conditions how we should have just taken care of that i don't understand how people think you can  take care of the pre-existing conditions just do away with that if you don't have a mandate that  says everybody has to buy because because that's how you that's how you open the risk pool otherwise 
[00:47:00]  it would be like you wrecking your car and then going to all state yeah now i want to take out  insurance yeah that's not how insurance works but i hate the mandate and i don't think they have the  right to tell any human being in this country he loves a good mandate hold on a second sir you  missed a you missed a rather insulting comment by my co-worker and one that i feel created a hostile  work environment i don't like how he says it says insurance insurance that's how they say it down south 
[00:47:30]  all right good continue continue boring everyone oh jesus go ahead sir sorry uh the floor is yours  that's that's that's the only way to start spreading the risk out and works is uh is by doing that you  can't just get rid of pre-existing convenience pre-existing conditions yeah well i i don't know  that's what i said but i'm i'd never profess to be an insurance expert uh and know how to take care of 
[00:48:00]  certain problems without making others in the insurance industry but what i will say is um it didn't seem like  obama and the democrats wanted any help with um figuring out certain problems with this legislation  uh from the other side that's for sure and i i realize how hostile the other side was towards it  but um there just wasn't any cooperation so well next year they'll have to be a huge bailout  probably of the insurance industries because of uh uh because the young people aren't signing yeah i 
[00:48:30]  don't think the people that are supposed to pay what happens to the young people that aren't  signing up aren't they going to be penalized no they're under their parents until they're 26.  so what so he wants the young people to sign up but why would they if they're under their parents  exactly all right until they're 26. i'm going to raise that penalty high enough because that's  going to be too unpopular so the yeah but i i hear that it goes up to almost 700 eventually right  eventually didn't i hear that 650 or something like that all right robert thank you we got to move on 
[00:49:00]  because i mean the phone's just lit and in all fairness we got uh nothing has changed for me my  wife's a teacher maybe that's why um so that has just come in i don't know we got a 62 year old my  insurance went up to eighteen hundred dollars a month uh i want to comment on how obamacare affected  this area we got a call from indiana chris go ahead chris yeah um yeah pretty much uh i mean i  live in the orthopedic capital of the world uh you know big medical industry uh we really have 
[00:49:30]  a lot to do with the insurance company so but on the far side of it uh there's more to it as far  as like obamacare the treatments and stuff because it hasn't affected anything in my area or even  surrounding towns i mean that i i know a lot of people i deal a lot of people i know people that  haven't had insurance but don't have insurance now and their biggest faces is that you know they've  had to go to the hospital or for something you know now they have medical bills you know some of them  up over a hundred thousand dollars and you know they it's going on their credit they can't do a 
[00:50:00]  whole lot with that and it's you know it's good in a way for people like them but china can afford  it if it is cheaper you know because in some cases our insurance is expensive it's because of the air  yeah but like obi said it just it it's good for those people but the amount of people that were  displaced and fucked over and inconvenienced and uh and um forced to pay more money the people that are  far out numbers it's just shifted now it's different people being hurt by this whole 
[00:50:30]  fucking someone once said the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one correct  correct i mean and it's and it's it goes to show i mean there's other there's other situations in  insurance now they're making you know your family doctors they won't allow you to prescribe you any  kind of narcotics or pain medications you got to go to a specialist and if he's a specialist he doesn't  have to accept you if you don't have insurance you don't even have to feel right hold on a second  now your regular doctor can't prescribe certain things no no no not anymore no it's i mean it's  mandated as far as like in indiana and i know in ohio uh they cannot prescribe you narcotics why 
[00:51:00]  that could be a pretty good thing actually there's a lot of doctors a little willy-nilly with the  painkillers out there no those painkillers why force you to go to a specialist like that's just  the way to get you to another doctor that's been the way they've been doing things for a while too  with just medical procedures and stuff you go to your you can't just go to a place and get like  a cat scan or something you have to go to your gp and he's got to refer you to that so we came from 
[00:51:30]  we came from a time where you went to your doctor they just knew everything yeah okay we need this  and this done you go down the hall or whatever i was like no no you got to go to this guy on the uh  upper east side another doctor that you got to pay another clipping for yeah yeah because of my  because of my dumb hummus tooth i had to go to three different dentists and i finally looked at  my dentist like what are you going for yeah what are you doing why are you sending me this guy and  then i come back from that guy and then you go well now you got to go to this guy because that guy 
[00:52:00]  you go to school for yeah exactly shouldn't you know all this stuff i have great insurance  to be my wife my wife oh my god is this guy still talking my wife and i sir  i'm sorry i'm sorry because it's the subject matter it's just infuriating i mean we have a  very good insurance we don't have to go right we've got three kids but you know we pay around  as a braggart i am cum works is that raising them up write all this in your  i can't imagine getting any better insurance all right write all this in your christmas letter 
[00:52:30]  to your family jesus yeah well your merciful suicide note all right hey thank you guys all  right buddy thank you chris you're welcome former military because of obamacare he's lost all his  benefits my insurance went up i got hit with the tax at zach in indianapolis uh greg in ohio  my wife uh my wife my wife works in health care it's so broken only way to fix it is to add more  people uh john in massachusetts my buddy's wife had cancer twice insurance canceled her went to obamacare 
[00:53:00]  she still has no specialist wow uh and i can explain how obamacare helps small business  really we're small business and i'm not going to employ as many people i'll tell you right now  there's no way that's the other side of it yeah you just don't hire as many people  because every person we have every person we hire because of our our corporations we got set up we got to  make sure they have health insurance so now it's like fuck that i'll figure out that i'll figure 
[00:53:30]  out another way to get some of that stuff done exactly that's that's that's a reality that's what's  happening across america with small business and 99 the shit out of people but to be fair let's see  what he has to say about that jay michigan go ahead hey guys good morning how you doing all right  all right all right all right most of my most of my friends are uh self-employed or own small business  and what obamacare has done uh most of those guys all their income isn't claimed and the guy who 
[00:54:00]  called earlier the the guy from the truck delivery guy and the wife's the dog groomer what these people  are doing now since obamacare is income based they don't claim all their income so people who work for  cash are taking advantage of the system and now they're able to get health care on the cheap while  the people that are working and have a paycheck and can't hide their income are paying are flipping  the bill wow the the another the previous caller called it you know equalization it's not equalization 
[00:54:30]  it's socialization it's socialized health care all these arguments you know we could have predicted  we'd be having these discussions and if you unless you were an idiot and couldn't see the writing on  the wall on how this is going to go what they i don't think what they expected to happen was all the  employers cutting people down to smart time so you're losing the cash pool now those people  that have to pay for for everyone else all of a sudden they're not working the hours and  and contributing to the fund and it can't support itself and that's why obama is dumb and most of 
[00:55:00]  our politicians are dumb they didn't see the fact that a lot of people would drop their employees  down a part-time attempt to hire flat-out fire them yeah they didn't see that that would be the other  side of this they're just stupid people in washington yeah of course people are going to do that because  they got they got their survival instincts kick in yeah as human beings so you're like okay i can't  have as many people working for me period that's what's going to happen but why why would they ignore 
[00:55:30]  that in washington are they that stupid and we're just and we're just as dumb for falling on one more  thing uh that one of the earlier callers also said something about how the right wingers the same people  that are that have their arms up in the air now are the ones that were claiming voter fraud before  i just started saying on the news this morning north carolina just uncovered 35 000 cases of voter  fraud and i wonder and i wonder i wonder who they voted for yeah all right sir anyway punch out guys  thanks a lot let's go to a doctor we're all over the place with this uh we got kevin he's a doctor in 
[00:56:00]  michigan kevin hey yeah how's it going guys like hey let me tell you where uh all that money's coming  from to pay for those people all right here you know they're cutting you know the whole plan was  to cut back on medicare that's the old people's medic uh medical coverage so uh like now the patients  i take care of if they need to get fluid uh you know intravenous fluid at home they don't pay for it  they have to pay for it out of their own pocket oh yeah so uh just uh just hope you're dead before 
[00:56:30]  you hit 65 i would one thing i hope i'm dead before i hit 46. yeah me too you know what i think  right now that we know that that's good to know at least there's all those asteroids out there coming  that's what's always reassuring to me so uh never know right an asteroid hits who gives a  shit about obama care all right thank you kevin all right we can wow we could stop it here for today 
[00:57:00]  every day though man look at the phones everyone i know it's uh it's a big issue i heard a lot of  negative not not a lot of positive a lot of positive no and of course agatha we're ignoring your call  yeah again we're scared of you of course i think agatha is a troll i firmly believe even though you  the agatha believes what agatha is saying i don't believe that's that real person well she's lying  if she you know i'll say it again she said i guess on twitter that we don't take her call or something  why not you should talk to her it's of course i would love to get someone like that on the show 
[00:57:30]  be amazing watch the twitter battle live between all right yeah yeah not uh not constrained uh twitter  one more jeff in jersey jeff oh pat thanks for taking the call man it's my third day trying to  call in oh boy sorry the phone's a bit lit on this listen listen and and i got there a little bit  didn't destroy my company but i've been through five months of hell with this um i'm a small business 
[00:58:00]  owner from the 90s and have always taken pride in the fact that i could pay for all my employees  health insurance um we get the word about obamacare my insurance company raises us 61  out of the chute from seven seventy thousand dollars a year to 120 000 a year somewhere around  there of course we can't afford it i call the insurance company they say it's because because  of pre-existing condition everyone's doing it i get on the phone with obamacare actually after a 
[00:58:30]  week of trying on the website i get on the phone with them yeah they didn't have the web oh whatever  sorry everyone knows they couldn't even figure out the website no no they couldn't figure out the  website amazon during christmas doesn't crash right and and you know well to make it worse  they didn't have a program for small business they told me that i had to contact the insurance  companies directly so i mean i don't know how many people they thought didn't work for people and 
[00:59:00]  didn't have to worry about small business but in any case i contact the insurance companies nobody  can get back to me because they're all too busy trying to sign up individuals so finally um i went to  my employees and said look guys i can't afford to pay for you let's all see what your rates are going  to be individual oh boy every one of every one of my employees went on to the obamacare website 
[00:59:30]  after months of trying to get it to work finally got it to work the end result is is that the more  you make the more you pay i pay i pay twenty one hundred dollars a month now for the health for the  health insurance and used to cost me eleven hundred dollars a month and but some of my employees are  paying five hundred dollars a month with full families when they never had to pay anything before  because you were supplying them yeah no no and hear me out what i did was is that i had them 
[01:00:00]  go individually and now i'm reimbursing them for it because their costs were are now cheap enough  where it's about where we were before yeah coverage the coverage is nowhere near as good  and and for a lot of us we're paying well for me i'm paying more for a lot of my employees but i'm  also paying less for the ones who don't make so much money so if i worked for this guy i would be like  yeah i got the insurance and then i'd just pocket the extra money every month and buy black beers  yeah we have to have them show the receipt you know just just because this way it's a an expense 
[01:00:30]  reimbursement i hear you so there's no taxes taken out of it we just reimbursed their right  you're an amazing reimburse oh god all right sir there you go till to reimburse again i'm busy i've  been in bursting all day all right thanks man all right buddy thanks for sharing your story i mean  the phones are just yeah every single one of them is lit but filled by whiners yes bunch of

[01:12:30]  disco star wars disco star wars how embarrassing and you watch dance with the stars chris jericho was on  i watched chris jericho of course yeah but you can dance like mick mars in this last one  what is the billy d williams interview on uh tonight at midnight wow stay up for that one  kids yeah they'll be on demand too mike francesa rants against uh paternity leave yes  mike francesa rules he doesn't like that wow no a special case here wait paternity leave paternity 
[01:13:00]  leave yeah what's this story for a guy right yeah there's a baseball player i guess who's taking some  games off because he's having a kid right and then this sends get out on the field well that's  francesa's opinion fuck lou gehrig got out there the iron horse i thought he had the lou gehrig's  disease still look out there but paternity leave was never for guys but re in recent years it it  absolutely is come on like i could have i could have taken eternity leave for guys maternity leave for 
[01:13:30]  yeah right right of course from the latin right here in matter right but they should call paternal  but if you're if you're a guy and you're and you're taking you know leave because your wife's  having a baby they should say it's maternity leave for you from the from the from the pig latin  ear quay i totally took all the paternity leave i could from this place you did huh yes three days  off i'm gonna thank you yeah but you've missed you've missed some of the celebrity interviews 
[01:14:00]  and good laughs yes you did how much time did you take travis uh i think i think it was only like  three days didn't it didn't it wasn't that much they only give you three days the ewoks cheering they  were cheering in the crowd that was cute jim that's george lucas though when i see ewoks oh that's that to  me is george lucas's guts if if i if that new star wars comes out and there's an ewok in it  i'm done jj abrams will do something like have an ewok but it'll get like hit by something yeah  maybe like a split second on the screen they just get hit or there'll be one come on and it'll just 
[01:14:30]  get punched in the face and the fans will cheer i hope he does something like that i hope so yeah  it's called the family leave act all right now they got the guys involved i think it's kind of dumb i  think it's a chick thing and uh francessa doesn't appreciate it no like it of course he doesn't he's  old man it's a baseball player should be uh in the waiting room with a cigar again and then once  the baby's done you go out you drink with your friends you just smoke some cigars well he went 
[01:15:00]  off oh he did why do you have to take a week off i don't that i don't understand baseball player taking  a week off because his wife's having a baby that is kind of crazy it is crazy you're playing baseball  stop but they already have a cool job you can't even call it a job they've got a cool life he takes  this way beyond baseball though this is about good paternity leave as a whole oh okay well five  days off i really don't i've been honest i don't get it but i think you're allowed what is the  rule four days is it four days maternity leave three days four days here we all not here what 
[01:15:30]  what is it with the base major league players what is it here is there such a thing yeah 10 days  that's ridiculous what do you need 10 days for what are you supposed to be doing vacationing  in the old days they didn't do that but one day go see the baby be born and come back you're a  major league baseball player you can hire a nurse i love them to take care of your other take care of  the baby if you wipe these off i mean i i'm being honest i don't see why you need what are you going  to do and now you get out the day after anyway i mean they don't keep you in the hospital long 
[01:16:00]  unless something's going on they don't keep in the hospital harrison was born at 9 a.m  i went to hospital the night before with my wife house was born at 9 a.m i was here at one  that's here one i mean i don't get it i like him of course he was he don't get it  that woman just push that baby out and get your ass to work but he makes a very good point if you're 
[01:16:30]  a baseball player you could hire a nurse easily to help out your wife at home yeah and baseball you  you got stats and you gotta show up for baseball right not only that but you're on the road for  80 days a year anyway so yeah yeah what does that matter i mean 10 from the year you don't have to  take them all at once if you're not taking them right away then why are you getting them what are  they for what do you do you work the next day then you take off three months to do what have a body  what are you doing three months later i love him what sense does that make he took advantage of it 
[01:17:00]  i don't even know you could do that well what would you be saying you're doing at that point  i was in maternity leave the baby uh i was here the day the baby was born i took the day off i came  back the next day but i took maternity leave three months later for what to take pictures  he's great and if you're a guy it should be called maternity leave much as yeah so you have 
[01:17:30]  to deal with the humiliation right that's saying that you need to take maternity maternity leave right  and then he finishes here to take so that i i would think i would guess and i'm guessing this  i would think you remember the old sitcoms all the time where it was always the guy pacing the waiting  room and they come out and say you had a baby and he's handing out cigars because the guy was never in the  room then it became i think the natural childbirth the lamaze and everything so you were participating 
[01:18:00]  so you were in the room which i understand  okay now i wasn't participating in my wife because she had twins so you know i was not participating  and you know basically staying up talking to her while the doctor was you know doing what he was  doing so but i was in the room they handed me the babies when they were born i was there 
[01:18:30]  but what was i gonna do afterwards the babies went to the nursery my wife went to sleep i went to work  the babies went to 
[01:19:00]  the nursery my wife went to sleep i went to work  i don't get it i'd rather go out and get a couple of hits if i was a player  it is embarrassing if you're a major league baseball player and you're taking maternity leave  he is such a guy just a dumb guy it's brilliant he's the sports they talk in sports and everything 
[01:19:30]  he talks about with personal life and things like that it's just out of the mouth of a  fucking guy what are you doing are you having a baby what is your wife having a baby what are you  gonna do take pictures for what for a party that was good man that was some funny princess right  there he's an animal i loved it he's absolutely he really is the greatest 
[01:20:00]  go to nursery 30 years you know go ahead and do yourself a favor read a book read a book  let's say hi to jay and nyack jay  hey guys i don't know you have to get through a long time fan go back to any of these days  i'm very excited your exuberance is enraging i'm using that up this early in the morning but i  us neither and i'll listen to you on the replay anyway that's right i'll get to the point  francis has got a lot of nerve you know what the guy kicks off half the summer he kicks off half the 
[01:20:30]  summer i listen to the fans sometimes he takes off half the summer he's got a lot of nerve talking  about people taking time off does he really take half the summer off he gives himself some days  that's crazy because baseball is you know pretty important in the summertime yeah but even  he knows you can take off half the summer come back in and i guess you're right where you left  long as long as you're there late summer early fall right exactly like now you know the yankees  drop two games and stuff and the the the sportscast is like oh yankees uh two in a row it's like 
[01:21:00]  that doesn't even fucking matter in the least at the end of the season but you do know you're  gonna have a very shitty season right we all understand this okay good but the yankees always  have a way he's gonna suck this year the yankees always have a way of pulling it out to just  almost like right just enough to disappoint you at the end of the season where it's like oh you  coulda last year yeah this is the jeter tour they're just they're not going to he's gonna get  accolades everywhere he goes every fucking city this guy goes you beat up on mike too much leave him

[01:23:00]  you look at yeah you ever see a baby swimming around a skull or a cat for the bottom of a tank no fish is  better okay and what you're saying is you know the baby's going to be around for a while that's  going to be uh only one of a very few seasons that players actually get to play listen to me i'm going  to be looking at that kid forever okay i only got 162 games of damage left okay you gotta weigh your  odds here okay yeah yeah i hear you no okay uh this is not going as well as i thought okay but uh 
[01:23:30]  no it's actually we like it very good i like the food i like the little goldfish tank and we like  how your wife had twins and then you were at worked by one at work that's that's impressive babies went  to the nursery the wife went to sleep i went to work yeah you went to work yeah i don't know if i got the  the point of course okay because i only said it and i know him okay uh 375 times a good baby's  one and all i have zero one okay now never mind my job is reading the newspaper drinking soda okay 
[01:24:00]  that's what he does yes okay i'm going to save this here at the end okay uh everybody i  always listen to the man's okay it's long enough okay okay i want a shirt okay 20th anniversary shirts or  i want a shirt b i'm going on a mask and c okay uh well i choked on my own throat there and i want  to run my own little phone scans here after that okay so i call up on somebody and i'll say uh  okay uh and they have someone hello i go yeah this is fatty mcdye soda draker and then they get 
[01:24:30]  that and then i go all right all right that's not how they say it oh my god i forgot that uh mike  princess is very racist i forgot about that all right thank you mikey let's say hi to keith in  jersey keith good morning boys good morning keith so james joseph yeah i i got the first thing i  tell you james you look really good on amy schumer the other night thank you say that thank you i still  haven't seen it is a nut bag because he doesn't get the concept i mean the reason why they're doing 
[01:25:00]  like in sweden and fending all the scandinavian cutters i mean those guys are taking like six months  off we're talking about taking a little time here because they've proven psychologically it allows  the father time to bond with an infant at a critical time the child's development that's why  that's the big thing behind it well men never used to do that well again look at the  up way that was great that's the father-son relationship the father-child relationship 
[01:25:30]  yeah you bond with the mom she kids sucking the titty and shit and then the father you know he  just comes in after work hey how you doing we all love getting days off but to actually have to tell  your co-workers about good take some uh maternity leave bonding i'm gonna go bond with my kid for a  while yeah then you wind up with a situation where your father winds up calling you pissy eyes all the  time well you know what maybe some of that was my fault maybe i shouldn't have been so pissy eyed 
[01:26:00]  as a kid there you go jesus fucking sissy with dolls i was a little fairy mary  all right sir we're gonna take a break because i think nick de paul is here so we're gonna clear  the field and nick will join us next  next  next sorry sam was in here  and he said he would take blame for it right on 
[01:26:30]  ah very happy nick de paulo in studio  hi he admitted uh right away that he's never seen star wars never seen it i find that actually  amazing fascinating i hate that yeah but you're old enough to  you fell right into the thing when it came out you were probably of the age that was  right in the demo you didn't want to uh what year was that 77 97 i was like to pawn by then  it was 15. yeah yeah but all these years you would assume you would just 
[01:27:00]  i did somewhere like 10 years ago it was on hbo yeah this nice volume who built this piece of  shit uh divine you know no no it's the buttons whatever all right but i tried watching like the first five  minutes yeah you know a talking bowling trophy and a black guy with a hat you gotta suspend your  disbelief i can't i don't fucking it's like scooby-doo i hated that too everybody likes scooby-doo i'm 
[01:27:30]  like what the fuck they're not cartoons you know uh foghorn leghorn the fucking anvil would fall on  a raccoon's head that's funny right scooby-doo is just a detective show you could do you could use  real actors yeah right i never liked scooby-doo either i liked the old warner brothers cartoons  they were clever and it's funny but like scooby-doo came out i was like yeah this sucks the animation  was terrible the scrappy-doo days were better when his nephew would come that's adorable  they would be surprised every time when they had to pull the mask off yeah oh yeah when were they 
[01:28:00]  gonna learn that boy they didn't get the criminals like putting masks on they didn't change up the  plot line of those shows watching a regular tv show only yeah animated right you know cartoon the  whole idea is to have shit happen and like that a human shotgun right in the duck's face spins around  his head type of shit hey slow down you can't show that anymore yeah they took all that out they  took all that off tv one of the funniest things was pink panther i still remember the scenario like 
[01:28:30]  like a piano fell on his head and crunched him and he was all wrinkled so he laid himself on an ironing  board and he started ironing and then a phone rang and he left down in his stomach and it burnt a hole  through his stomach brilliant and then he put a put a he put a clock in where the hole was in his  stomach and the alarm went off and he vibrated on the fucking brilliant scenario that could never  happen oh geez exactly my point although you don't have any dog solving crimes either you know unless  the woman's like where did i lose my peanut butter detective scooby on the case 
[01:29:00]  oh what's going on nick well you know i'm here to plug carolines again nice it's like what is this  1999 all over fucking jesus when's carolines uh tomorrow night saturday night and sunday night  all right cool yes you're not doing tonight huh thursday no you know why i'll tell you why we had a  battle over money and i ended up winning the battle on money and lewis knows i hate working sundays  so he gives me the sunday instead of the uh a little fucking twist that's my theory i don't

[01:34:30]  was that about welfare i love it you're so funny you guys are talking about and i'm in the car and  i'm screaming at the radio i stopped screaming i hear either opiate anthony goes missing the car  now probably yelling in his radio that was me i had no doubt damn that's what i heard as i stopped  yelling i'm at the car going it's a fucking ruse don't you understand it is a ruse this whole  fucking thing you got new insurance because you're a guy that doesn't have kids and you got you got  now you know pay i don't know but i i know i can get my uh yeast infections paid uh that's good yeah 
[01:35:00]  and uh i know there's also this uh a controversy with whether catholic uh religious organizations  should have to foot the bill for birth control yeah and abortions and things like that and that's  kind of a tricky situation if you're gonna adhere to the rules and say that the that you you the  churches do have a right uh then you can't force them to pay for a woman's birth control if it's 
[01:35:30]  against their religion right good points how about they pay taxes fuck them pony up i'm not against that  at all i absolutely i think the churches should have to foot the bill also for taxes absolutely  and if yeah if they want to say and and what they should or shouldn't do and pay your taxes  motherfuckers and then and then you can use all the charity you do as a big write-off yeah slow down  growing up we were a church you guys of course the hughes family was a church we were a church what  do you mean you were a church my dad figured out a way oh my oh we're a church yeah we don't have to 
[01:36:00]  pay taxes his real name is greg hubbard i'm not just no the part of the thing is opie molested  himself exactly can you blame him we actually were officially a church he found a loophole but then  he got mad if i we didn't take the tax exempt uh certificates with us and so we can show them  we're a church so we don't we don't have to pay taxes wait you would go to a store with these tax  exempts i never did it was it was it was so embarrassing and if you like bought groceries and  they said all right 60 dollars and here's the tax it was more like getting you know some sneakers 
[01:36:30]  or something with your pals at the mall and then my dad expected me that to hand over this thing  that proves that we're part of a church so i don't have to pay taxes did your dad build a steeple on  your garage hey he figured it out for a year or two but what stained glass windows in the kitchen  about that i don't know this is like did you have a store on his go what is this no you pay taxes  some kind of tax exam certificate that you handed in i've never heard of it i never did it because  like i said i'm a teenager i was mortified yeah that's been so i had to go home and just lie oh 
[01:37:00]  yeah we we did it it worked it worked how long did that scam go for a few years a couple years  buying a thousand hut pockets for our flock  little loophole wow i think they should close that loophole your own man's brilliant i don't  think you can just start a church like that anymore there were people that would always  do that i like to there was no there was no services or anything everyone you understand  this right yeah it's a different type of we just were a church it's the church of the tax  exams exactly you're the original westboro baptist you make your signs 
[01:37:30]  yeah yeah our lady of wesley snipes you gotta do what you gotta do my dad was my my dad was smart  in that way yeah i guess he knew he was getting in the ass so he had some workarounds it was always  about workarounds right somebody talking about the taxes and saying you know the law says you don't  have to pay your taxes it you ever see those yeah my facebook it's like yes all right yeah you give it  a try let me let me know how it worked well wasn't there some remember there was some couple up new 
[01:38:00]  hampshire remember that they hadn't paid that wasn't paying their taxes because they said no  that's it's not a law where are they not they're rotting in a jail somewhere exactly he listened to  that and that was why he went to jail you tell them hold on we got doesn't hold up in court we got a  very pissed off guy what uh pissed at you and you uh uh that'd be nick and anthony i like obama uh  jake and philly go ahead yeah i want to talk to the uh old bitter millionaires get awake my kids 
[01:38:30]  millionaires i'm selling i'm selling weed to kids in the afternoon  all right sir what's what seems to be your problem jake my my biggest issue was your guys's  bullshit cop-out argument of a couple generations ago they would have gone crazy if they see what we're  doing now that's such a bullshit argument because literally three generations ago they didn't know  what fucking airplanes were you have to evolve with the time don't get me wrong taxes aren't where 
[01:39:00]  they should be there are some regulations out there that are bullshit don't get me wrong but to go with  that cheap ass argument when you're sitting on a fucking gold throne in there that's bullshit don't  tell me you know why because i could have two gold thrones you fucking dick that's right the government  is taking half my money don't look at me and say oh you're rich it doesn't matter to you i don't like  haven't had my shit i earned taken you try it asshole it's not about fifty percent we'll do a  percentage thing how much do you make a year let the government take half how will you feel  fuck you i love how this guy thinks he would handle it differently if he had more money exactly 
[01:39:30]  knowing if you had money you'd fucking just tra-la-la throwing it around to everybody  fuck off and it's not a gold throne sir it's a black seat with a fist on it exactly  i'm just tiny what you're a fucking retard you literally play you go and you play blackjack you  play thirty dollar hands you have fuck you money beyond thirty dollar hands i play three thousand  dollar hands you fucking asshole and you know why because it's my money to do it as i fucking please 
[01:40:00]  don't tell me because i spend my money irresponsibly that it's not my money i could do whatever i want  with it i don't want the government telling me what i have to do with it to a point i understand  taxes are necessary you got to keep the highways fucking paved and and and and shit running i  understand that but i don't want my wealth going to other people that haven't achieved uh wealth  to equal things out below me it's never supposed to be equal no it wasn't it's a free market system 
[01:40:30]  it was not supposed to be fucking equal wealth that's bullshit that's totally against uh what  this country's about i understand but my point is probably not awfully hypocritical to literally  spend all of this money the way you do and then complain when you have to write a little check a  little check a dickface you don't understand how big the checks are that i have to write  to government agencies you don't get it you're not educated enough to fucking uh voice this argument with 
[01:41:00]  me you don't know you don't know the amount of taxes i fucking pay and no one has a right to  tell me whatever money's left over how i can or can't fucking spend it blow me man you fucking  you you're the hypocrite no you're not getting the point you're not getting the point yeah i am  it's not anything about how educated or uneducated right off that point it's not educated i said  you're ignorant okay well okay ignorant has nothing to do with education you said he wasn't educated  enough to do it yeah okay well you don't have enough you don't have enough knowledge 
[01:41:30]  what okay go ahead keep talking so no it comes down to the fact that on one hand on just all that  i'm looking at is your personality on the show right that whatever good point you on one hand  you'll sit there go i went to uh borgata they took care of me uh i was basically it was like an  eighty thousand dollar night something you talked about and then on the right hand you sit there and 
[01:42:00]  fucking bitch like crazy about cutting these checks you just sound like a hypocrite that's all i'm saying  you're in trouble where's the hypocrisy there's no hypocrisy in spending the money my money that is left  over it's only half of what i earn that's left over and spending it like i fucking damn well please you  don't know what i do with the rest of my money either you don't know what i'm doing with the  half that i'm allowed to keep uh i talk about going to the borgata uh here on the show what do i do with 
[01:42:30]  the rest of it think uh gary glitter and pete townsend exactly i had a whole fucking i had a whole  gaggle of mexicans in my yard yesterday oh were they mowing the lawn getting the leaves out of the  way it was fantastic i pay them very well in cash too right that's how i work well you got it you  don't want to pay you no that's a good point though you're employing people i'm employing  fucking people uh rising tide lifts all boats yeah i got carpenters working downstairs in my house i got 
[01:43:00]  painters i employ people motherfucker i understand listen you don't let me just one more point and then  i'll hold on carl wants to hit carl might maybe carl agrees with you i don't know carl watch a bill  cox's outfit go ahead carl you're on with jake he got no gas in it he fancies himself a faggot i  agree with him oh fancy this motherfucker i was in my early fucking twenties when obama got elected  the first time and i guarantee you that just like every other young person my age i knew this cocksucker 
[01:43:30]  voted for obama and loved him first because why it was a popular fucking thing to do that that's  right fucking celebrity and that's it you know why i'm a fucking republican because my fucking  dad worked his hands with a fucking bone every fucking day wouldn't let him touch me exactly  scary he gave happy ending massages his dad did what worked his hands to the bone this guy  i'm gonna let him hand you the birthday cake it's disgusting he's got a bony hand yes get it jim 
[01:44:00]  boyfriend's cock would he be happy to do that ah he's laughing go ahead jake so all right let me  let me just make my point and i'll hang up oh boy oh you didn't address you didn't address carl though  carl made some good points this is like meet the press time it really is yeah i thought carl made some  good points yeah i i agree i'm gonna refute to what he said because he's making accusations that aren't  true i'm in my upper twenties i'm a small business owner i'm what kind of business what kind of 
[01:44:30]  business jake thimbles well why were you small are you it's sales i employ what about the faggot  what about the faggot part well it's all right everyone can tell that they're well i'm fighting  it oh sorry well you said he had a lot of things that weren't true i figured you would start with  the faggot thing well you know nobody's perfect um this is before you go before i forget uh this uh uh  this is the mentality though this is the mentality you're right that somebody should have a say over 
[01:45:00]  what the fuck i do with what's even left over now right like i don't have a say for half my money  half the money i earn i have no say in what happens to it it goes away and now some of these  motherfuckers want want to have some kind of say in what's left over and how i should spend it and how i  should feel about spending it and and why shouldn't i just tell you to go fuck your mother when you 
[01:45:30]  you come out with something as stupid as that it's a tax on that please let me finish please it's not  it's not the fact that i want to dictate how you spend your money it's just hard for the average joe  to swallow your rants when you can live the life that's none of it but that's none of their business  no i think it is easy money you know because percentage-wise it's all relative take a person that makes  forty thousand a year let them keep twenty of it and then have the neighbor tell him how he should  spend that twenty thousand he'd get punched in the face is what would happen it's not about trying 
[01:46:00]  to dictate how you spend it but it's just hard to relate that's my hey you know what you relating to  how i spend my money ain't my fucking problem either but this is affecting everyone the middle class  it's a new mentality when i was in my twenties and somebody was rich i wanted to be like that i didn't  fucking go he's a brick make a villain of a center yeah yeah that mentality is caught on in this  country it's evil you know we've also made the point that to us it's just annoying we do have  enough money in the end but this shit is also affecting the middle class nobody gave it to you 
[01:46:30]  how long you guys been getting up at 4 30 in the fucking morning where was this guy when i was  fucking covered in insulation in an attic in the end it's like cutting holes in the ceiling  it wasn't boring it's kind of funny oh wow it's kind of funny we got you on that one we've said many  times it's more annoying our girlfriend's perfect age for me to them our lifestyles aren't going to 
[01:47:00]  change drastically but i come from a huge middle class family they're being affected by all this  the middle class is spoiled i agree and and jake you would be just as mad if you made a lot of  money exactly everyone that talks about well if i had the money no guys you would do the exact same  thing he gets successful he would try every fucking loophole in the tax system to keep as much money as  he could right he'd be angry at every check he has to write to government agencies you you're you're 
[01:47:30]  you're lying to yourself i'd be having bake sales and give the proceeds to people of color  eggs i'm a small business that sounded so sincere small business owner what what what's your  business what feels it sells it's industrial sales it sells weed oh it sells pipes exactly so it's it's  a small business it's four people i write good checks it sucks all my point simply was it's just  hard for the regular person like myself who i do a fairly good living to hear someone and well let me 
[01:48:00]  make you understand that that's what you have to relate to if if you're successful you get to spend  the half of your money you're able to keep in a way that you want to spend it to uh entertain yourself  to have fun to be responsible to keep a roof over your head to keep your family safe and healthy and  and uh uh keep uh loved ones um in in a maybe a car whatever that's how i spend my fucking money  i got larry in indiana he wants in on this jake he might agree with you i don't know let's see what 
[01:48:30]  happens all right larry larry larry another faggot on the phone go ahead larry  jake's all right oh jake's gonna be a good phone screener  it is nobody's business what anthony cumia nick de paulo sam roberts the man or  greg opius does with their money it's nobody's damn business why is it their business what i do with my  money larry yes you're dangerous because you had a problem larry yeah a few weeks back he's the 
[01:49:00]  religious but hold on larry how come it's okay for them to know what i'm doing with my money  yeah what about jimmy norton little jimmy norton i have some money he's got a few bucks in his back  pocket couple of shekels right i think jimmy's made it public what he does his money that's true  he's got a urine stained pillowcase and that's against what the lord  thing larry's a larry's a god guy sexual reassignment surgery one lucky devil at a time  you mortified and embarrassed that i forgot james norton will you ever forgive me i will 
[01:49:30]  larry it's understandable larry but it really is nobody's business the government is so involved  in people's lives that you can't get free of government and that's what our country was  supposed to be that's what it was founded on we're past the point of any type of revolution  or anything i'm not going to get off my couch no who is well well we're past the point of any kind  of revolution that's already been proven to work i mean any kind of um revolt of the people that's 
[01:50:00]  gone that doesn't happen and if it did it's such a small pocket of people that they're just put under  as nuts and lunatics and right-wing fanatic so we're in a position where they've actually succeeded in  in quelling any revolution that might start it's got to be a different type of revolution but  again there's so much good shit on tv revolution i get the mlb package for christ's sake yes see  exactly it's crazy the season just started uh jake what do you got what do you got to say larry 
[01:50:30]  uh we're gonna have to agree to disagree i think oh come on jake that jake i'm sorry i thought i bought  a good fight it really has gotten invasive though the government invasion is just it's it's really  sickening of course it is but both sides do it and that's why it's like the democrats do it with your  fucking money and the arch conservatives do it with religion it's like just stay out of my  fucking business yeah but one day let me say i should what what is the have you got in trouble  from fucking religious not rice ever no but it kind of i mean that was true years ago they used to 
[01:51:00]  fucking but they're not the ones getting people kicked off the air and shit it's  it's not but after janet jackson that was a conservative administrative all like the the  the fines going tenfold all that was the conservative administration rolling downhill  okay but that doesn't affect your everyday life you know i mean they're not telling you what kind  of toilets to use what kind of light bulbs to put if you say something on the air that gets you fired  now it's guaranteed going to be a liberal yeah absolutely true but if you slip and say  fuck liberals are much more likely to overlook it and go out as a fleeting that's true but but in this 
[01:51:30]  day you're probably not going to get in as big a trouble as you would have years ago you probably  don't fuck i don't know i find them both to be repulsive with that and i was always saying like  fuck the liberal but then when after janet jackson that was not a fucking but i think it's a lot more  look if you say uh the the seven dirty words on the radio uh yeah you'll get some arch conservatives  saying well the children could hear that and you get in trouble but that at least is a black and  white thing you say it right you don't say it here's a list don't say this this vague obscure 
[01:52:00]  yeah ideological bullshit that they could pull out of their ass and all of a sudden you're  a racist a homophobe a fucking misogynistic that can ruin your life that that can ruin your life  right it has religion you say many people's lives on the air and get fired you could get another job at  a radio station cbs could find what jimmy what what was it was like five million dollars for a network  that brings in a billion a week no i mean i'm saying also like you know that they want to dictate who can  get married they both have their fucking where they want everyone wants freedom but everyone 
[01:52:30]  is comfortable removing other freedoms that they don't like it's it's an irritating american thing  that we do we all do it we're at the right i just don't see it as as pervasive on the right they  used to have that juice but the religion i think it's annoying but as far as being pervasive as pervasive  as the liberal uh what you can say in speech codes on campuses and all that that's all that's all a  a liberal thing is the fucking language and the pc and you're you're a phobe or i think it's a lot  more dangerous on that side uh the thing i don't like about the religious right is the fact that you 
[01:53:00]  know i i think stem cells ought to be fucking harvested from live children at this point  they're fighting stem cells you're being shocking you're right they also fight uh again gay marriage  is a big thing that's a big part of the population and the fights yeah but they have gay i mean the  catholic church is talking about having gay priests and stuff it's not like they're not bending  and they're not trying they're not supposed to bend right right a religion is an institute it's not  supposed to change all the time it's about i don't agree i'm not even religious you know i love how  i'm always labeled a conservative i don't fucking been a church in seventh grade right i don't give a 
[01:53:30]  shit about that stuff yeah yeah uh you know they are bending with the times they're considering having  women priests and they have to yeah it's one of those things where it's like they're not supposed to  a few billion in lawsuits they'll do that to you yeah yeah no kidding good point jimmy you know  what's fucking lawyers trump christ wow great point it's a good name for a band it's just annoying and  it seems like in this day and age in this country uh and i think a lot of people are under this  misconception although the misconception is kind of turning into reality we are it's like we're given 
[01:54:00]  our rights it's like the the government is allowing us to have our rights and that isn't it  these are rights that are like god-given as inalienable as inalienable rights that you're  supposed to have for just being you are you exist here are your rights and these people are supposed  to protect them yeah not protect those right now you walk around and you're walking on eggshells all 
[01:54:30]  the time because it's like oh they could take that away oh boy they're curtailing this right they're not  supposed to ever be able to do that but but it's become such commonplace that dummies that aren't  educated as to what the constitution is actually believe they jump on the bailout that the rights  were given to you by the government to regulate as they please so there's never an argument because  they're stupid that's right and it is an inalienable right which was eventually granted to everybody  eventually this is a good change we got a good call coming in from unfortunately that old tall 
[01:55:00]  hat budinsky not even him the broads the other one's voting in obama christian white supremacist  wife he wants in badly on this one go ahead dan hi dan  hey what's up guys dan thanks for the call go ahead dan okay uh i want to start off by saying  anthony i really uh i agree with like 95 of your rant and i really do appreciate you fighting  a good fight for us i want to say though i think what the other caller was trying is well not so much 
[01:55:30]  because you have small business but when you're really struggling and you see how much the dick has  take like it really is disappointing to the fact where you can't i i understand from a prison day  room we can't i know that you're echoing and i understand that point but what do you think i  was i was born into the getty family i worked half of my life i worked as at a real job where i  carried down any things i should have said rockefeller i know what an obscure what do you think i'm a 
[01:56:00]  i'm a hess rudolph no you're too conservative  yeah it's i worked for a living i understand what it was we're poor for most of our lives i looked at  like nick said i looked at people that were well off and successful and i didn't look at them like 
[01:56:30]  that mother fucker oh fuck him i i used to go out on uh i was working i would go out on my mom and  sal's boat and see these giant fucking boats at watch hill and be like i want to fill them up and send  them back that's a good start and uh but but i never looked and said oh that scumbag that  fucking guy with his money why did he buy a boat so big he could you know it was something to aspire  to but i don't want to say what these guys are listening to because of course you're ranting uh 
[01:57:00]  a lot about it but then we you know go to the phones and and we get so many people that are from  the middle class that are going through the same shame but it really hurts their lifestyle and this  obama why don't you hear that part of it dan the middle class is paying for the subsidized health  care right so it's being taken out of their pocket if you're a middle class guy and you uh you don't  have a uh uh kids you you're not going to have a pregnant wife all of those premiums that you pay  for that goes to subsidize uh low-income people that that will get pregnant uh have kids need the uh 
[01:57:30]  orthodontia whatever so it's taking from the middle class who's already struggling  that's joe wants to see that joe joe's on the same um just on the same point we can know joe where  it's tough to understand uh where you're coming from go ahead joe yeah look guys um  things i was going to say is people are angry at you for a wrong reason i don't think they understand  the nature of how he pays his taxes so he gets i assume without prying that you guys get a check 
[01:58:00]  every two weeks or a direct deposit or whatever for a large amount of money because your employees at a  company however and therefore i don't get that though i'm just using this to get the exposure  like my aunt would say money doesn't matter to us to the point i don't even know how much they make  and where i don't know i just ask for cash cash under the table exactly we i haven't seen a pay stub  in i don't know it goes to the accountant oh god offshore we're hiding all sorts of money all over 
[01:58:30]  the place i'm going to be that guy that just is like well i have nothing left yeah i have a paypal  account in switzerland but okay we get money right yeah do we get paid weekly i really don't know it's  bi-weekly there's every two weeks every two weeks all right we get paid every two weeks like curious  there are plenty of there are plenty of guys here is directed usually who will own a company and 
[01:59:00]  decide what their actual salary is that's taxable at 40 or 50 percent right so that's say like 250  grand a year however they have stock options and all kinds of other with which is where they make  their millions that they can put in overseas accounts to get taxed at a much lower tax rate because  it's uh income tax something like that this accountant talk is great but oh did you blast  did he blast one no he said my chair had a streak so the point is that's where the anger should be 
[01:59:30]  because guys like me who make all cash income and only 50 grand a year still get taxed 40 or 50  percent but i can't take advantage of tax loopholes because i don't have that fucking  shit i can't i can't afford to have those types of investments and it's just the nature why blame the  guy you know that why blame the guy that's taking advantage of all the loopholes that are  available he's not blaming you oh i i mean i'm not i'm not him i i'm blaming the guy i'm not  blaming the guy i'm doing the system and when a guy gets that man where he can take over i trust  me i don't have that mentality the system man no i'm kidding don't worry about it i understand your 
[02:00:00]  point sir thank you you're a saint all right no i do i get what he's saying we got a major problem  here uh-oh yeah what happened uh john in indiana nick to paul's gonna be at carolines this weekend  friday saturday sunday why is that a problem is it someone else booked john john go ahead  hello what's up shame on opiate opie anthony and jimmy for being successful

[02:01:00]  long islander i'm not going to say from where you're not even from indiana the conch  is your name at least john we got anthony fugazi online too you want me to tell you where you have  it from the conch he's got a summer home in shirley oh it's even worse uh wine dance  i don't know copac copac that's one of those weird towns on long island i don't know much  about copac name of the lamb copac indians everywhere on long island is not a group who

[02:02:00]  well thank you john but i think we're also fighting for i i i truly believe we're fighting for the  middle class a little bit on this radio show exactly by the time they ponied up they've been cruising on  the backs of this country for years what are the parameters of the middle class what uh do nothing  expect everything for free whether it's like financially financially what are the parameters  i think it absolutely depends on where you live if somebody living in manhattan and somebody living 
[02:02:30]  in idaho or something like that yeah it's going to be a big difference in where you are as far as  middle class goes that's why when they throw this whole 250 thousand dollars a year if you make that  yeah that's what i can make them when you live in manhattan it's like making eleven five and make that  a carolines oh wow you do you're a little business man don't i make that a car i say i want all the  drinks you gotta like understand that that parts different parts of the country try to explain that  to people they don't get it because we're across the country 250 000 a year in manhattan is you're 
[02:03:00]  it's literally like half you're it's like making you're on the poor side you're not owning you're not  owning you're not renting i bought a house in peak skill yeah see nice i think they said the average  apartment now is uh around nine hundred thousand dollars for one yeah but that's like uh you get  like 400 square feet yeah that's what i'm saying one room the only good thing about paying a shitload  of money where you live is no matter where i go in this country no matter what i'm trying to buy a hotel 
[02:03:30]  room i'm trying to get i go wow that's cheap it doesn't matter where you go hotels are amazing in  other parts of the country because we're used to paying five hundred dollars a night in manhattan i go to  uh you know rochester a few times a year and then going to the best restaurants and stuff  quickly i think they fucked up yeah yeah but i go to the best restaurants up there with brother wheeze  and stuff and when these bills come i'm like this is this what are they are they paying for half of  this yeah what is this do they like you that much it's like no man that's all it is working in buffalo 
[02:04:00]  i was looking in in the uh classifieds that you know houses yeah yeah right i mean it's like  like 17 bedrooms indoor outdoor pool right staff right 18 5. look at the outdoor pool you have two  weeks here in buffalo it's an above ground indoor pool oh what white trash that'd be great yeah  above ground indoor pool a little deck around it it's nice it's amazing eight above ground pools yeah not a 
[02:04:30]  big fan of the above ground bees always nest under the ridges you know what i never thought about  that but that's a good point they do you try to come with ridges anymore no huh you're very dangerous  with ridges you grab the edge can i get it and you wrap your hand around it or a wasp nest you feel  something what's this papery feeling yes biting into my fingers 40 things objecting repeatedly to my knuckles  is it a colon 
[02:05:00]  you want more of these calls there's a lot of them oh they're compelling you know what these guys are  fantastic when they call in with their uh let's go to tyler political ideology tyler hey man what's  up welcome aboard thanks for the contribution a long time listener man um i just gotta tell you guys  i'm actually jealous of you guys when you pursued what you love and you're getting rewarded for it  and all these guys are assholes because they're jealous they get it but they should be just as 
[02:05:30]  bothered that's what i'm amazed by who should be bothered people who are listening at the same  shit's happening to them at a lower level yeah everyone actually i don't understand why they're not  bothered everyone in this country aspires to be wealthy it's a bad word fucking the sales are so high  when the numbers get up there but but until that happens there's just this look of disdain and and  on on people that are wealthy and you want them to pay more and they're not doing enough and they're 
[02:06:00]  hiding their money and they're doing it and then the second something happens that they become successful  they're doing the same shit because it's like it's the way we look at people it's like you know  you look at welfare it's like yeah fuck them there are there are a lot of annoying people at welfare  and then there are people that are legitimately needed absolutely i haven't met any yet but go  ahead yeah yeah i'm going by what i've been told but it's like when you think of when you think of  wealthy people you know it's like you typically don't think of the people who've worked really  hard and who are fucking middle class or average you used to not anymore yeah yeah you think of the 
[02:06:30]  people though that have just have just fucked people under them and the ceos that have fucked people  it's like that's the instinct is just that's why people lump in a guy limited those people are as to the  entire rich people it's like calling out like when you call out everyone on welfare as being lazy  cheating fucking disgusting people right and and then you generalize about ceos yeah but now you  generalize it with the wealthy and they're all bernie madoff every single one of them is bernie madoff  yeah i'm saying that's what people just know they just like that we absolutely should have been on 
[02:07:00]  welfare growing up for a few years there but you were church we had some weird yeah you were church  listen how i was you guys at bake sales and shit to feed yourselves i just i just stopped myself but now i'll  say we had some weird pride though yeah and i had to say it that way a weird pride like we had pride  in the fact that no we're not going to go on welfare and we'll figure this shit out and unfortunately  like all my catty money had to go to the household and babysitting money and we just collected it all  and made it work but we definitely should have been on welfare my parents just saw me in the 
[02:07:30]  prostitution that was the best way and you you probably were close to welfare absolutely for a  time when you were growing up my mom worked her ass off uh three jobs for her dumb kids but she  could drop two of those she could drop two of those jobs do one of them off the books and get the  welfare she uh she was a um a receptionist at a hair cutting place that's a stressful one yeah and  then she uh she worked at uh she worked at that disco chaz that disco out on uh and by the walt whitman 
[02:08:00]  mall that used to be out there back in the 70s what did she do at the disco she was a cocktail waitress  she was pretty hot back in the day she had to wear the short skirts and stuff yeah yeah  so she would do those tips and then uh also uh and then she would return punts for the jets on the  week yeah she was special teams uh wedge breaker set of legs on her she might have went out with an  athlete or two but we're not i don't think is that right come on i don't know any of this yeah 
[02:08:30]  they just found the show about any money they shouldn't pump any money into you know that  anthony's other things they did though that's so mean no i don't know you know that anthony's  stepfather threatened our lives back at any w because we talked about it he doesn't listen  anymore he called us up and basically threatened our lives did he really oh man that was a scary  day didn't like i brought up her she had a little relationship with uh eddie glenn ed glenn the uh  ed glenn relief reliever for the mets no picture game is that louie in a suit oh it's jim kramer i'm 
[02:09:00]  sorry are you waiting all day to do that one no that's too good that's too good no uh but yeah  but there was some kind of this and we always had what we needed it wasn't like you know we're  fucking poor man and and another thing i'll say that's kind of based a little on that no one in  this country is starving no i know no one is starving in the united states yeah yes they're 
[02:09:30]  not starving children in this country unless they're abused if they're abused kids like that  kid that was thrown in the closet and they tie him up and don't give him food that's a whole nother thing  there is not one child in the united states that is starving because there isn't enough food for  anybody it doesn't happen it's an amazing accomplishment i know we take it for granted  and we take it for granted and and people demand more money be pumped into it's the fairest country  on the face of the earth and everyone's crying that they're being shit on for uh for uh not getting 
[02:10:00]  enough please and when you blow all that money at the brigada yeah it's just rare where does that money  go is it helping the middle class or is it helping like i was helping degenerate gamblers  or is that i do very well over the people that own the casinos right and but they employ people  they employ a lot of people it's all trickle down you know trickle down uh works trickle up it  doesn't work chuck if you give somebody at the bottom money it's never going to make its way back 
[02:10:30]  up to you let me get chuck on the line here chuck chuck love north carolina we should all move there  what do you all right uh what do you got chuck thank you for the call all the damn people in  the country a lot of them to figure this shit out instead of having taxes took out their checks and  all they see is what they clear in that bullshit if everybody had to write a check at the end of the 
[02:11:00]  month to the government and to the state that's true show them how much they were supposed to get  real tall ever yeah you know it's got a slow boil this guy as he's calling us from the roof of an  island you just cut off negro toes and sold them you could pay them but you know what he makes a  point if you physically had to hand it out right feel it every week you get your check and then you have  to write a check united states treasury and write an amount that you would be fucking living and you know how a 
[02:11:30]  a lot of people get pissed off around tax time which is right around now we have to do that four  times a year we have to do it uh quarterly and and this form that's why the forms are so complicated  so you're not really sure what's going in and how much is coming out and and what that's why i'm  married during the year yeah there you go it's all guesswork it's all because again like this guy said  if you had to write that every week just based on here's your pay here's what you got to pay the  government there would be a revolution a while ago how do we get that going yeah we need to 
[02:12:00]  there's no politician that's going to turn off the phones and the tv we got to start there no  exactly which is never going to happen that's never happened i wasn't listening i was texting  what right what happened when dancing with the fruits is on i couldn't get off the couch last  night watching the socks and the bruins at the same time yeah see how the bruins i don't even know  i'm out of the best team in hockey are really i'm so out of hockey this year because my islanders  they lost their first game on the road since january open last night really  so maybe their first game they've lost three times in 30 games really record in hockey i'm

Your interviews and analysis.  Hanging with Nick DiPaolo today.  Playing Caroline's Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  I had to adjust my volume there. 
[02:23:30]  Why?  Because I couldn't listen to Patrice.  It bothers me.  So I turned all the knobs down.  Because I was just sitting here during the break.  Because he's black, right?  Then also I'm like, what's wrong with my headphones?  I couldn't hear myself.  Nick DiPaolo is at Caroline's Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  212.  212.  I used to know this number.  212-757-4100.  There you go.  Because I sing them to myself.  212-757-4100 for ticks for Nick DiPaolo.  212-757-4100. 
[02:24:00]  4100.  The shit that goes on back there in that hallway.  I went down to get some pretzels and a little apple juice.  Yeah.  From the kitchen?  Yeah.  You discovered the kitchen, finally.  I finally discovered the kitchen down there.  I was thinking to get a bologna sandwich, too, because you were telling me.  Pretzels and apple juice.  That's what I was saying.  Asshole.  It really is.  That's a great desitin for your hiney.  That's a great combo, though.  The apple juice and the salt.  Nice.  Oh, it goes together.  Nice.  It's nice.  I like it.  Nice.  And I walked down there. 
[02:24:30]  And, of course, Denny Falcone is down there.  Yeah.  What diet's he on?  Sorry.  Fucking Haitian fucking...  He is a slight man.  Sheesh.  He wasn't always like that.  No?  No.  You've known him?  Yeah.  How do you know him?  All right.  We dated in high school.  That's cute.  No, but, yeah.  Yeah, he is a slight man.  And so I just go, I'm like, hey, Denny, how you doing?  And he starts talking.  Yeah.  I don't know why you did that.  Why would you do that? 
[02:25:00]  I like Denny, though.  He's a good man.  It doesn't bother me at all.  He's a good guy.  It doesn't bother me that he enjoys talking a lot.  A lot.  You put him on, don't you, sometimes?  Oh, all the time, yeah.  We'd love to have him on.  Oh, you want him on now?  No, no, no.  You did that last time I was here.  Are you sure?  Are you sure?  Nobody even showed up at Caroline's.  I didn't even know why he was here.  We're here to see Dennis.  You sure you don't want to just...  No?  Okay, all right.  Just making sure.  But then Roland pops his head out of the office.  Now, who's that?  Wait, can you tell us the small talk, first of all, before you move on to the Roland part? 
[02:25:30]  Dennis, what are you up to?  Hey, just, you know, doing the log and, you know, trying to stay out of trouble.  Right.  That's what he called it.  You know, I was fucking...  Doing the log.  I thought it was a dance.  Doing the log.  Yeah, you have to, you just roll.  And then he's like, you know, maybe trying to get a picture with a celebrity or two, you  know, because you get a picture of a celebrity.  And then you could use that picture as you're, you know, booking some show gigs, some DJ gigs.  It's like, hey, look, he knows this guy. 
[02:26:00]  And that's when, uh, that's when Roland poked his head out of the office and just went,  Dennis, shut up, shut up.  Roland did it?  Yeah, yeah.  Roland just starts telling him to shut up.  And then I go, and he goes, see, I just saved you.  I just saved you.  And then Roland turns around and does this thing.  You know how dogs, like, like push dirt with their back legs?  Yeah.  He was doing that at Dennis.  Oh, that's the cat thing he does.  And Sam is fucking laughing.  It's a circus back there.  It's one flew over the cuckoo's nest down the hall.  It is, yes.  You should have seen, it's crazy, he was doing that at him. 
[02:26:30]  That's his cat move.  He hisses at you, and then he, he tries to kick his duty in your face.  You should have seen Roland and Sal, after Dennis talked to Nick, and Nick, because Dennis  said something like, uh, he did some joke about, uh, John Gotti.  I don't remember what the joke was.  But, uh, Nick, as soon as he's in the studio, Sal and Roland just start screaming, hey, Dennis,  shut the fuck up.  That's what they do, you piece of shit, stop talking.  I thought I was mean.  I know, that's just mean, but. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah, like, that's crass.  Yes, crass.  But we think he's on the spectrum, so it doesn't even bother him.  The spectrum.  On the what?  We think he might be on the spectrum.  If you're on the, that's like an autistic word.  But they say the spectrum now.  Oh, is that what it is?  It's a certain part of the spectrum.  Might be on the low end, the high end, somewhere in the middle.  We think he's just.  He's going to ass face burgers.  Yes, that's what he's got.  We don't like his tiny head.  Asshole burgers.  He's got a very tiny head.  His tiny head is offensive to look at.  And he walks like a marionette. 
[02:27:30]  When you look at it.  Well, his legs were broken when he was young.  Yeah.  He was hit by a car.  He got hit by a car, and both of his fucking little spindly legs were broken.  Both of his marionette legs were fucking broken.  That's what reminded me.  I wanted pretzel rods.  Fucking breaking my heart here.  I saw his legs remind me of pretzel rods.  His little brittle.  I'm throwing you.  His brittle little legs.  Exactly.  See, then you fucking get the pretzel rods, and you break them, and you giggle uncontrollably.  His dumb schoolboy hat flying off.  His Angus Young hat fucking getting taken off by a car. 
[02:28:00]  I think you should bring him in here so he can defend himself.  You sure, Nick?  No.  He's putting it on me.  Danny, come on down here for a second.  You've got to defend yourself, I'm thinking.  Hey, Nick DiPaolo's got a podcast, too.  Let's make sure that people know about it, Nick.  Yeah, it's getting funny, actually.  How do people get your podcast?  You know, they have to get on their roof, wrap themselves in tinfoil, and face Doom North,  and fucking...  Only if it's raining.  I don't know how the fuck...  No, iTunes.  Oh, iTunes.  Riotcast.com.  Nickdip.com. 
[02:28:30]  Are you on the Riotcast network?  Stitcher, whatever that is.  Whatever that one is.  All kinds of shit.  It's all over the place.  Are you part of Bob Kelly's empire there?  Yeah, actually.  I wouldn't call it that, but...  The Bob Kelly empire is podcast empire.  Yeah.  No, Riotcast.com.  Yeah.  Okay, so go to Riotcast.com.  You'll see Nick's podcast.  Real funny, man.  Nickdip.com.  And Caroline's this weekend.  And also, I was writing some notes.  I apologize, but you're working on a bit about crystal meth.  You are? 
[02:29:00]  But it made us laugh.  Yeah, I don't have anything yet.  I'm not going to pull it out.  But you're obsessed with crystal meth all of a sudden.  I am, because I watched Breaking Bad, and I loved it, and then I watched a documentary  on it.  Right.  You know.  Yeah.  And they're telling you how easy it is to make.  It's a good drug.  It's pretty fascinating.  If you want teeth of a 40-year-old squirrel.  You do that?  It's like...  That kills me.  But yeah.  Is that shit that good?  I don't know anyone that has actually done it.  How can it be good?  You know what it's going to do to your face and your teeth. 
[02:29:30]  It has fucking brake fluid in it.  Oh, nice.  Literally drain cleaner.  Drain cleaner.  People are shooting this shit into their fucking...  Holy fuck.  I love this country.  Amazing.  Yeah, yeah.  Carburetor fucking cleaner and auto...  Like quick start stuff that you spray into the carburetor, right?  Yeah.  Damn.  I have a great joke on meth.  Oh.  I'm like meth.  I'm like meth.  Boy, I guess bathtubs aren't just for bathing anymore.  And I like look...  I make the look at the face.  You look like what? 
[02:30:00]  Like I'm an EV at the Improv in 86.  You say apparently.  You say apparently.  You know, they have a smart joke.  Apparently.  Apparently.  I'm not for bathing.  Apparently, people.  Thank you for my apple.  Why are you shaking?  Why does he get it wrapped up in a towel like that?  I like that.  You don't want him to bring anyone.  His fucking sweaty hand.  I don't even wash them.  My wife...  You know.  I think of the homeless people at the supermarket.  Yes.  Picking up your fucking guava.  I don't wash vegetables or fruit.  I don't believe it.  You know what?  I haven't died yet.  I read a whole thing on... 
[02:30:30]  Well, it's that website that I go to every so often.  It's a bad word.  It's the N word.  And then it's mania.com.  And if you go there...  That's the name of the website?  Yes.  Yes.  It is hilarious.  I gotta say.  Because I go to the other side, too.  I go to some of these black militant websites, and they are brutal, too.  So it's, you know...  But are they hilarious as well? 
[02:31:00]  Oh, yes.  They are.  They're funny.  Very funny.  So the N mania is white people?  Oh, yeah.  People?  Oh, boy.  Is it ever.  Yeah, I don't like that type of stuff.  And they aren't missing words over there.  But, ooh, they have videos and news, and there's this one.  News?  It was just called Wash Your Fruit at the supermarket, and I looked at it, and it was why you would  wash your fruit, and, of course, it was all the old stereotypes, and...  It's the beauty of the internet, isn't it? 
[02:31:30]  Some of my audio from this very program turned up on that side, too.  Is it right?  I'm very proud.  And they were like, let's never get this bad.  Let's tame it down, Anthony.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The videos are great, though.  You put them on.  It's like, that's where I found that video.  A lot of sports highlights?  A lot of sports highlights.  I saw the video of the black guys barbecuing in the grocery shopping cart. 
[02:32:00]  See that one?  Oh, no.  They put the wood...  You know underneath the cart where you put, like, the big bag of dog food?  That's where they put the wood.  You put the wood there.  You put the food in the...  And they'll put the food in the grill.  That's brilliant.  And they're cooking.  It's brilliant.  That's friggin' brilliant.  I think it's brilliant.  And then if the cops show up, you can just wheel your barbecue away.  No muss, no fuss.  And they were cooking.  What are the cops going to do, though?  It's just a barbecue.  They're just hassling people because they're black, Opie.  That's what they do.  I see.  That's what the cops do.  It's not like they're cooking a baby in it.  No.  That's unbelievable.  It's actually... 
[02:32:30]  It was.  It was great.  I would like to see that on a cooking show.  Why isn't that on the Food Network?  I tune into every episode.  Shopping cart gourmet.  Can we play that video again for Nick?  Grilling with Jerome Flay.  This has watchability.  It really does.  I love the audio.  This guy is...  He's talking it up.  I love this guy.  I'd watch this.  I gotta record this shit, nigga.  That's what you call...  That's what you call motherfuckin' ghetto families to the fullest, nigga.  Hold on, hold on.  Let me get exclusive on this meat, guys.  You know what I mean? 
[02:33:00]  I'm gonna get exclusive on this meat.  You feel me?  Check the grill out.  Nigga, look.  Look.  Look, nigga.  Hold on.  Hold on, nigga.  That's a mobile grill.  Nigga, grill on wheels.  Motherfuckin' grill on wheels.  That's how we do things, man.  Where I'm from, niggas?  You gotta eat.  You feel me?  You feel me?  You know what I'm saying?  Season water.  Season water.  That's right.  All we miss is some onions on it, bitch.  You feel me?  Onions on this big film.  Dig it.  All we missin' is the real grill. 
[02:33:30]  You know what I'm saying?  What's he pourin' on?  The nigga from Publix brought us a Kroger goddamn buggy.  Kroger goddamn buggy.  Are they in the White House lawn?  Shout out to the show, bro.  Shout out to the show.  Shout out to the show.  What's happening?  You know, quiet, baby, drink.  All right.  All right.  We do this shit.  Get old Fabulous.  Get old Fabulous.  That's actually...  I'm gonna go home and try this.  It's brilliant.  It really is.  I gotta get a shopper card.  I'll probably get a plastic one.  Yeah.  I wouldn't recommend the plastic ones.  That is friggin'. 
[02:34:00]  It would melt the plastic one.  Oh, literal Jim.  Are you talking about the hood?  Nigga, that's some hood as she.  Some hood as she.  Make what we all have, Drew.  Is that Michelle?  Who wouldn't want to hang out with these guys?  Right?  Oh, I love it.  It looks fun, man.  Nick raises his hand.  He's marinating it with his cup of gin and juice.  Right.  It's just fantastic.  Get old Fabulous.  What are the odds they paid for that shopping cart?  Ah, yeah.  That could be a problem.  I think they should be doing way better.  That's fuckin' almost...  It's brilliant.  It is.  Who looks at a shopping cart and sees a barbecue grill? 
[02:34:30]  I didn't.  It's fuckin' be...  I mean...  I just thought, oh, it's a shopping cart.  You gotta lay the tinfoil down, though.  Oh, yeah.  You gotta.  Nah.  I don't know what they spray those shopping carts with.  That fire burns it off.  It's keeping them from rusting.  You know, after an hour after that barbecue, that shopper cart was up on wheels, missing two wheels.  They're missing the wheels on it.  That was unbelievable.  It's brilliant.  I love it.  Hold on.  I was gonna buy a Weber.  What an idiot I am.  Yeah, fuck that.  Jeff in Charlotte has more info on that video.  Go ahead, Jeff.  Yeah, it's just... 
[02:35:00]  I hope you just kinda mentioned it, but it's the same thing that he said, is that those  things are coated with, like, super rust-protected and stuff like that.  Oh.  And they're burning it.  It's smoking off into your food, so you get to consume all that stuff there.  I thought they were just made of stainless steel or something.  Yeah.  Oh, look at them.  They're super chromed and stuff.  Oh, chromed.  Yeah, there's just some chromium.  Right.  Oh, well, what are you gonna...  That's not good for you, right?  You know, lying in the blood.  Wow.  I don't think they're gonna have to worry about what happens later in life, as far as their  health goes.  I was gonna say.  Yeah.  So they die at, what, 48 instead of 49? 
[02:35:30]  I think they have to worry more about lead poisoning at that age than any other metal  problems.  Speaking of which, let's go to Chicago.  Tiny!  What's up, guys?  I bet you you're not tiny at all.  Big guy?  Yeah, big guy.  6'1", 280 pounds.  I love when they call those guys tiny.  The joke never gets old, does it?  No.  Well, I tweeted you guys a couple times.  I go by shites outside.  I called Jimmy hetero.  I feel like this is a very hostile work environment. 
[02:36:00]  I can't function.  And I think that the fact that if somebody makes a gender mistake with a prostitute, you  know, if it happens under 300 times, you can't make any claims.  And so far, I'm still barely under the bar.  You should go to HR, Jimmy.  Yes, exactly.  What do you got, Tiny?  Oh, you guys are talking about grooming a cart.  I was telling the guys on the phone, and I'm just a white guy from Chicago, but I got invited  to a project party from some friends in what was called the Rockwell Gardens that are turned 
[02:36:30]  down now.  But they had a big old party up in the projects, and they busted holes into the walls that go  into all their apartments.  And they invited me for a project, and I'm like, man, what the hell is this thing?  And I see the smoke, and they were barbecuing in the tub.  They had all the charcoal up there and a grill over that.  In a bathtub?  In the tub.  Holy shit.  Again, not a bad idea.  Get a grill over the top.  Yeah, they busted into one of the empty apartments, put a hole in there, and then they had the  fans blowing up the smoke out the top. 
[02:37:00]  Oh, see?  They were safe.  Holy shit.  Put that energy into getting a job.  That is so ghetto.  I love it.  There's only two of us white guys in that place.  I got to tell you what.  It was a pretty crazy fucking game.  Yeah.  It was probably fun, right?  Of course it was.  Oh, it was awesome.  It was great.  You should have videoed it for some educational channel.  Back then, we didn't have the videos, but, you know, I got two white guys with a bunch  of gangbangers.  Yeah, right.  Why were you hanging out with gangbangers in a vacant building?  Why are you doing? 
[02:37:30]  Exactly.  Edward James Olmos, you were educating them.  Mine is a terrible thing to waste, young brother.  Terrible joke as well.  Wow, was that a long bomb.  I tripped on his name, and it had nothing funny to follow it up.  I really completed the fucking trifecta of horrible guys who shouldn't do comedy.  Oh, you're in a shy rack.  You've got to explore, you know?  You're crazy.  Although you're a big guy, you can take care of yourself to a point.  All right, Tiny.  Bye, Tiny. 
[02:38:00]  Good talking here.  George Miller came back to life.  I'm watching TV making comments.  People at home are going, what the fuck is it talking about?  We do that all the time.  Oh, yeah, that one.  Oh, my God.  Nothing else in the news.  No?  Not really.  Other than missing Malaysians or shooting at the fucking Fort Hood.  Oh, we did it all year.  I know.  I was in the car on the way down.  What about the Malaysian thing?  Any thoughts on that dump?  Yeah, good luck.  I fucking...  They're not going to find it.  I dropped my watch in my cousin's pool last summer. 
[02:38:30]  We couldn't find it.  Good luck finding a fucking 11-year-old Malaysian kid.  Jesus Christ.  In the ocean.  From 5,000 feet, they're looking down in binoculars.  What's that?  Oh, it's a fucking turtle.  Yeah.  In the most obscure part of the ocean, by the way.  That's why I know it was a pre-plan.  The guy programmed it and said, you know what?  I'm going to fucking depressurize the cabin.  We're going to choke ourselves out.  And then this thing's going to make a hard left and land where nobody can find it.  No one can find it in the middle.  It's like the one place in the world that is the worst place for a plane to go down. 
[02:39:00]  That's not an accident.  Brilliant.  The guy thought it all beautifully.  No shipping lanes down there.  No nothing.  Even the fish are like, what the fuck?  Where are we?  There's a comedy club there, though.  Yeah.  Exactly.  When you depressurize like that, if he did that, like knowing that he would be knocked out.  Yes.  Do you think that they all die because it got so cold?  Like in Payne Stewart, there was frost on the inside of the plane?  Or do you think that they...  I don't think that's what kills you.  It's the lack of oxygen.  No, no, but you think they die before they hit the water?  Oh, fuck yeah. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, I think so.  Yeah, they'd be dead.  They didn't find anything on his flight simulator either.  The FBI has finished that shit up.  Is that going to be the one alive guy on that plane?  Oh, man.  What if somebody else is still treading water?  Oh, jeez.  What were they drinking?  Something out there.  Water.  Yeah.  It's odd, though, because there's the co-pilot.  Now, if you start depressurizing the cabin, isn't he going to notice something's amiss?  Well, obviously, you get him in on it and go, look, I'm going to kill all of us, and you convince him. 
[02:40:00]  Oh, okay.  You talk him into it.  No, you hit him with a fucking fire salesman.  Hey, Harry, I'm going to get a coffee.  What's that?  That's your first coffee.  I'm going to get a coffee.  That's your first move right there.  There you go.  I'm going to get a coffee.  Hey, here's the last words.  Why are you picking up the fire stick?  Yeah, that's what we found on the black box.  That was the pinging we heard.  Hey, be careful with that stick. 
[02:40:30]  All right.  That makes sense.  Don't thud of metal.  You knock him out.  Got to worry about this now when I fucking fly?  Yeah.  Suicidal pilots, huh?  You always assume the pilots, you know, got it together.  The fuck?  And apparently not.  They call it suicide.  Isn't that murder-suicide?  That is.  What a selfish fuck.  That's mass murder.  Do it yourself.  Yeah.  Steal the plane at night, you jerk-off.  Does that go in the books as like the mass murderer?  It should.  As one of the biggest mass murderers.  Yeah.  I would imagine it has to. 
[02:41:00]  I put them right up there.  Yeah.  Because you're killing a lot of fucking people.  And we've learned that there's a lot of garbage in the ocean.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Everything they say, oh, this is the greatest lead we've had so far.  It's just garbage.  It's a fishing net and a fucking Barbie doll.  The tsunami in Japan.  That shit's still floating out there.  Yeah.  Probably.  They're finding shit from the Titanic.  Shipping containers for some reason.  They're falling off of boats.  I took a dump off a boat in high school.  I'm sure that floated.  Everything goes in the Indian Ocean.  That's the place to go. 
[02:41:30]  I dropped my watch on my fucking cousin's pool.  How hilarious is that?  I still can't find it.  God damn it.  Good luck finding the fucking perfect sense.  Let's come up with another phrase out of the needle in a haystack.  I'm telling you.  Exactly.  Jesus Christ.  How about a cock in a cockpile?  There you go.  No one has ever lost a needle in a haystack.  So why would we even use that?  You wouldn't even look for it.  You just got a new needle.  All you'd have to do is fucking get a metal detector.  You'd find it in three seconds.  Exactly. 
[02:42:00]  Exactly.  Or burn the...  Kurt Cobain on a farm?  All right.  Or just burn the haystack until...  Yeah, there you go.  What's left?  The needle.  You don't need the haystack.  What do you need that shit for?  The needle's on top.  I mean, how long after you drop a needle in a haystack do you realize, oh, nerds, I needed  that.  They did that on Mythbusters one time, though.  Did they?  Find a needle in a haystack.  How did they do it?  There were a couple of different methods.  One was...  I think one was burning it.  Right.  And another one was magnets.  Magnets.  Really strong magnets.  Yeah.  I bet you fucking have a horse do it and then you search his shit. 
[02:42:30]  You see the hay.  A horse eating...  Yeah.  And then when the horse...  Ah!  It tips on me and then he found it.  Oh, floating the hay in the water.  There was another one.  Oh, look.  We're learning.  But the needle would never be far into the haystack.  Do they...  Well, you gotta shake it around.  Put heroin on the needle and we're not such a drug addict.  You'll find it in three seconds.  Exactly.  What?  You gotta think.  Hold on.  CNN has gone with every theory.  I didn't hear this one.  Suzanne in New Hampshire.  Go ahead.  Go ahead, Suze.  Hi, guys.  Good morning. 
[02:43:00]  Good morning.  How are you?  I'm good.  I'm good.  I was in the car the other day and CNN was floating all kinds of theories and I heard  the tail end of an expert saying that possibly they could have given the co-pilot some kind  of laxative or they waited until he had to go to the bathroom and then the pilot...  Maybe.  You know, if he leaves the cockpit.  Sure.  No, but no one's noticing these shenanigans.  First of all... 
[02:43:30]  One pilot goes into the bathroom, the other pilot gets up to lock him in.  What are we looking for, a shit-filled toilet in the Indian Ocean?  They lock the flight deck.  Yeah, what happens is, though, and maybe the flight attendant comes on.  There's always someone that comes on to fill that space just in case the guy has a stroke  or a heart attack.  The door can be open.  But who knows?  Maybe it's easier to incapacitate a flight attendant than it is...  Oh, well, they did say...  Yeah, suck a punch.  ...a cup of coffee.  I mean, but when they floated that by...  Well, they also said that it could have been a black hole, so I don't really watch CNN 
[02:44:00]  for this anymore.  I do believe also that the pilot, whoever's left on the flight deck when the other one  goes to the bathroom, has to put on oxygen.  Why is it a duck deck?  Does he really?  I don't know.  Oh, I didn't know that.  They have to put on oxygen while...  Just in case.  Yeah.  So that would be a perfect thing to do.  You fucking wait until he takes a piss, you put on oxygen, now he's not suspect that  you're putting oxygen on, and then you just depressurize the cabin.  Wow.  He's cool for a little while to do whatever he's got to do while everyone else has passed  out.  We just figured it out. 
[02:44:30]  No more talk about this.  That's not what I...  The theory I heard was that he told the co-pilot...  Yeah.  He said, hey, do me a favor.  Go back in a coach and get me some minestrone soup.  Because that's where it was.  They didn't have any business.  Minestrone soup.  And the co-pilot was walking, and he's in business, and he looks back, and like, remember  De Niro and Goodfellas?  We go, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, over there.  Yeah.  No, no, in there, in there.  I have to go.  That's aggressive.  I didn't know that.  That would make sense now.  It's funny, miss.  I was hoping that you'd get hung up on, but you made a great call. 
[02:45:00]  Thank you.  Quit watching CNN, will you?  Yeah.  Enough of that.  Oh, right.  Oh, why?  You wanted to watch faux news?  For Christ's sake, what are you doing?  You're panicking.  You should be...  Live free or die.  Oh, yeah.  A real fucking red state, New Hampshire.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Live free or die.  Blue as my balls.  It's a state of dead people now.  All right, guys.  You've got to go to work.  All right.  Take care of yourself. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  Thank you for the call.  All right.  You can't get there from here.  Yeah.  That was always a scary license plate as a kid.  Live free or die.  Why?  Yeah.  What happened?  They don't really follow through, do they?  No, they don't.  Do they?  They don't.  Spilling over from Massachusetts.  Oh, that.  Yeah, another one.  That bastion of fucking...  And what are we talking about?  We live in a fucking horrible...  Oh, it's fucking...  Awful.  Why go out and vote state?  Yeah.  It's fucking just the worst.  Cuomo now. 
[02:46:00]  Got his fucking mitts in there.  I know.  Seven fucking rounds in my gun.  And then people get arrested for having ten rounds in the gun.  Legal, legitimate gun owners that have never done anything are being arrested for having  three bullets too many in their magazine.  Who comes up with these arbitrary fucking...  How does that make anyone any safer?  To take somebody that didn't hear of the law, didn't misinterpret, left in the morning,  just loaded up his magazine and slapped in the gun. 
[02:46:30]  Without thinking about how many rounds he's allowed to carry.  And do you think that's translating to people that are using illegal guns for crimes?  Absolutely.  And they're going, up, up, up, up.  Yo, man, get those rounds out of that gun.  Why do they have to have that?  What kind of accent was that?  Because that is the majority of gun crimes.  Those weren't deer hunters.  I'll tell them I can't be.  Yeah.  It's kind of silly.  It is silly.  They're not going to follow the same laws.  That's why I just wound up loading seven rounds in my magazine and carrying two extra mags 
[02:47:00]  with seven rounds apiece in it.  So now I carry a fuckload of bullets instead of just...  I would have just had ten bullets.  That's a good thing.  Now I carry 21 bullets with me.  He has a fucking...  He has those hat that you put two beer cups in it, but they're filled with fucking magazines.  Just bullets, bullets, bullets.  Bullets, bullets, bullets, bullets.  Just two beer cans with bullets in them.  Yeah, what are you doing?  My hat is heavy with bullets.  I love bullets.  Yeah, my chin is on my fucking chest.  I put bullets in my hat. 
[02:47:30]  Creep.  Phil in Philly.  Phil?  The law that does nothing.  Phil?  Guys.  Hey.  Phil?  Hi.  Hi, Phil.  That's a Jersey in Jersey calling us.  That's next.  I just visited niggermania.com.  Their website is old and awful, just like Anthony.  It is terrible.  Oh.  And there's like no content on there.  What?  It's like a 2003 layout.  No, you go to the message board.  Oh, jeez.  No, it's all...  Don't go to the...  You just go to the message board. 
[02:48:00]  It's all about the message board.  I felt like Jesse Jackson targeted a drone at me.  Oh, no.  I'm sorry.  I should have been a little more specific.  You don't like the website?  Phil.  I'm not going.  No.  It's like being caught with child porn on your computer.  It really is these days.  I think it's terrible.  I think it's...  Of course, it's legal and it should be legal.  But I find most people that will go on there and post all this stuff, most of them are just  these fucking cowards that would never say stuff.  You can't say that stuff.  Yeah, but you and I can't either.  Like, people always go, yeah, but you guys have jobs. 
[02:48:30]  I can't come on and do this without any...  You know what I mean?  Well, if somebody wants to have a forum to be racist or to voice their opinion in the  most horrible language possible, why should they have their jobs threatened and...  Then we should live in a place where we fight for each other's fucking abilities to not get  fired for stuff like that.  But it's not going to happen.  Yeah, but those guys wouldn't fight for anybody's ability either.  Those guys are part of it.  So until then, a certain aspect of your freedom of speech should be cut off because there's  this lingering threat over your head that you're going to lose your livelihood. 
[02:49:00]  No, I'm not talking about...  I'm not saying it should be illegal for them to do it.  I just find them to be cowards.  But it's basically, it's not illegal, but that's a technicality at this point that it's  not illegal.  There are penalties for voicing an opinion.  And I'm not talking about inciting a riot or inciting violence against somebody.  I'm talking about just putting your statements, your opinions out there in hard, harsh language.  That has now a penalty that is equivalent, in some cases, worse than a jail sentence.  Because you're losing everything you own.  What I'm saying is, it shouldn't be illegal to use fake names. 
[02:49:30]  I'm not saying you shouldn't be allowed to do that.  I just think they're cowards.  And there's always been that penalty here with what you said.  It's changed.  You could say, well, you could say on nigger mania, you know, you could say in the 50s,  you can't say now.  It's just kind of flipped.  There's always been shit you couldn't say here.  It's got...  Always.  There used to be a lot more impact in what you had to say for it to affect your life than 
[02:50:00]  there is now.  Now, it's just if you insult someone.  If your opinion differs from somebody's and they call you a racist, you could lose your  job.  In the old days, you used to have to incite a riot.  You used to have to do something.  Tell someone to kill somebody.  It wasn't just a basic opinion.  In the old days, if you insulted the church on a certain level, there was a tremendous  penalty for that.  In the old days, in certain parts...  I mean, back in the...  Who was losing their jobs over insulting the church?  I don't think anybody...  I think that's...  If people did that...  People by the week losing their jobs for insensitive remarks on groups, that isn't freedom of 
[02:50:30]  speech.  It's not.  It's disgusting.  Yeah.  But again, if we're not going to be consistent with it, we have to fucking be consistent.  But that speech will go away if we penal...  If we don't let people be anonymous and post those things, that speech will just go away.  People should be defending...  I have no problem with them saying what they want to say as themselves.  I don't think they should be fired.  I think they should be allowed to say...  But they will be.  It's what you think.  That's the fucking environment we've created where we just... 
[02:51:00]  And I don't mean you and I, but I mean that we don't stick up for each other.  People don't stick up for each other's right to say shit like that.  You're right.  They don't.  So, in the meantime...  But I still don't go on forums and do it.  Until this wonderful utopia happens where we're able to do this with impunity, we have  to not use our real names.  So we can get our points of view out there in the public eye without being penalized.  I don't fucking use...  I've never used a fake name for anything.  I know.  And I can't go on and say that stuff.  And you know what I mean?  I don't either.  I don't want to say what they say on...  But there are plenty of things I've wanted to say that were brutal. 
[02:51:30]  Right, right.  Where I'm like, ugh.  I have to think.  And I'm not saying that's the way it is.  But I fucking operate as myself all the time.  And people know how I feel about stuff.  I do it too.  I get into a lot of debates on Twitter and stuff.  And I use...  It's my real name.  You know where I am.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I speak very openly about things.  I'm not...  I try not to be offensive in the common sense of the word.  People are offended by what I'm saying.  But I try to think out what I'm saying so it's not like, oh, you're in trouble. 
[02:52:00]  That's like one of the biggest fears is that I'm going to post something that is taken either out of context or blown out of proportion.  I'm just having a discussion.  And that comes in with what we were talking about with that guy that called up the other day.  And I said, he goes, we need to have an open discussion about race.  And I'm like, oh, that's great.  Until the white guy opens his mouth with an open discussion.  And then he loses his job.  He's a racist.  Everyone wants an open discussion.  Until you have it.  All that's true.  And I agree with you completely.  I'm only talking about the attitude those guys take on those sites. 
[02:52:30]  Like, they're these fucking, these defenders.  And they're these fucking little cunts who won't use their real names.  Don't come off like that.  Just say, I hate niggers.  Say it in that fucking tone.  But don't act like you're this fucking ball to the wall knight when you're hiding behind fucking N-Hater 22-L.  But I think.  Oh my God, you got me.  I'm 21, so I recognize you.  But I think it is.  That's what bothers me.  The penalty is so severe that why would anyone in their right mind put their real name on something, even if you do believe it. 
[02:53:00]  The same reason I don't go out and say some of the most.  And again, it's not that I want to say that.  But there's fucking horrendous shit I've wanted to say.  And not been able to.  And it is frustrating.  But I have to fucking deal with that.  And I deal with that under my real name.  It's just a penalty line.  I kind of like that ideologies get out there, even if it isn't with anonymous posts.  I kind of like that it's still getting out there.  They should be allowed to be anonymous.  I don't think.  Because it's a fuck you to the people that are trying to curtail everyone's freedom of speech by being the morality police out there. 
[02:53:30]  It's disgusting.  No, it's I'm going to pretend to be one way when I'm really another way.  Because you know they don't have that moral courage in their daily lives.  That's the same guy that walks in.  He doesn't shun the black guys in his life.  Like, oh, hi, how are you?  It's completely, here's my fake personality.  Your personality is real.  Everyone knows this is what Anthony Cumi has said.  This is how Anthony Cumi feels, like it or don't like it.  You're not hiding. 
[02:54:00]  There's not one black guest that would come in here and not be able to research every single thing you've ever said.  So to me, there's a reality in what you're saying.  At least you are being you.  And we've got a guy that has been affected by exactly what you're talking about.  Phil in Brooklyn, retired NYPD.  What's up, Phil?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hi, Phil.  I worked with a guy, and he was working the West Indy Day Parade.  And in the parade, there's a guy who's covered in oil, and he just sprinkles people with oil.  I don't know if it's an Asian thing or whatever. 
[02:54:30]  And he took a picture of this guy and put it on his Facebook.  And he just wrote, filth.  Like, having dirty.  Uh-huh.  And the next day, the Daily News called him up.  Oh, shit.  He was in the paper the next day, and he was called down to internal affairs.  Just for saying that word.  And that's the climate we have to fucking end.  Like, that, to me, is sickening.  But again, everyone has to.  Saying what word?  Filth.  I'm referring to somebody in the community as filth.  Just posting a picture of a guy, and then putting filth under it.  And he got it.  No, you've got to fight back.  You've got to stop whining about it. 
[02:55:00]  You've got to fight back.  Yeah.  You've got to fight back.  He was spraying, what did you say, oil on everybody?  Oil.  It's a ritual they do.  Like, they spray oil on people when they see them.  Of course, when they see the cops at the parade, they take a handful of oil and hit it  on them so they get filthy.  That's what they do.  Okay.  So it's kind of a fuck you.  Yeah.  We should have the third world rituals.  Yeah.  Right.  But we don't defend that stuff either.  On Fifth Avenue.  We don't defend that stuff either.  We have to defend people for being able to give real opinions without getting in trouble 
[02:55:30]  either.  But everyone just kind of sits and watches each other get strung up publicly.  Honestly, you do have to defend things that you find reprehensible.  Yes.  You don't have to like it.  You don't have to participate in it.  But you do have to allow it to exist.  Oh, yes.  And, but that's something a lot of people don't even realize.  They think that they have this right to not hear something.  But that is, you don't have a right to not be offended.  They think they have a right to not be offended.  Right, right.  Yeah.  That's not a right at all.  Freedom of speech is, it's created to defend unpopular speech.  Yes.  Not fucking, I mean, that's why it's there. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah.  Everybody, if it's fucking happy-go-lucky speech, it's like, no one cares.  Exactly.  Yeah.  It's like I say, my ears are not garbage cans.  Oh, that's what your butt is.  Jesus.  It's like Jimmy's ass is a garbage man.  I'm holding her.  Just kidding.  I'm just piling on myself.  Of course.  Dan in North Dakota.  Dan.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Welcome aboard, Dan.  Well, I appreciate it.  You know, the thing about that is, is, you know, everyone's just a little scared to even 
[02:56:30]  talk about, you know, anything.  You know, like at my job, you go, oh, hey, they have this whole memo saying, if you say  this word and this person finds it offensive, you could be fired.  So it's not just about the nigger issue.  It's about everything.  No, no.  I know what you're saying.  Their feelings are hurt.  You're right.  And that's a sick fucking thing that we have allowed to happen by not defending each other. 
[02:57:00]  It grew out of the racial thing, though.  It did grow out of the racial thing.  And now it's spreading to fucking women and gays and fucking...  Other groups saw the success of how you could just call someone a racist and knock  them right down and said, well, now you're a homophobe.  And we said this was going to happen, if you remember.  Political correctness is created to stifle white heterosexual males, basically.  Show me a black guy getting in trouble for saying something about a white guy or a gay  woman or a fucking female comedian getting in trouble for shitting on them.  Ain't going to happen.  No, it all depends on the group.  Like, you know who black people get in trouble by? 
[02:57:30]  Asian groups.  Because Asian groups don't have a guilt with black people.  They have...  Like, if black people say, like, radio hosts say shit about Asians, they fucking go right  after them as much as they grew up to white guys.  Well, that's because they're, you know, fucking stealing their bodega shit.  But you know what started political correctness?  Am I...  Hold on.  I'm sorry.  That was a joke.  Andrew Dice Clay.  I can't think of anything right before that.  But he, with the women's groups and the gay jokes, and then they saw...  People saw results when they went after him because they yanked his movie deal.  He was such a lightning rod. 
[02:58:00]  But I'm trying to think of what before Dice, because Dice, I think, was responsible for  a huge part of political correctness without meaning to, was they went after him, they  got his movie yanked out.  What before that was the real lightning rod for it?  Well, I don't know.  But if you watch movies from the 80s now, you see, you can see it taking shape, the  political correctness.  Like Philadelphia, that movie, all the old white guys were in the sauna making gay jokes  and shit.  All the bad old white guys.  Every movie from the 80s, you can see it, where the fucking, where the guys start to 
[02:58:30]  get stupid and the wife is strong.  Yeah, yeah.  Just watch all the movies, you can see it taking hold.  Now it's at a level I never thought it would get to.  But as far as a single, you know, other than a single person before Dice...  Yeah.  Maybe he was just, I hate to see Strobel comes back, but maybe that was the, it started  like maybe you said in the 80s, and then when that happened, it was people was like,  pow, and they got results.  That was a big one.  And then Kennesim, Kennesim.  Kennesim was in that same world.  Yeah.  But like, Rickles were doing it for years.  Never grandfathered in, I think. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah.  And he was doing it without cursing, necessarily.  That's true.  And he had everybody in.  And what's fun about that?  Exactly.  What is that, better?  Oh.  I'm black.  You're black, I'm white.  Em's the brakes.  Oh, is he funny?  Jack, what do you got for the show, buddy?  Hey, man.  Jimmy, he's like the little Jewish guy in school that used to walk up to the black guys and  go, hey, you know him over there?  He just called you a nigger.  You know?  He's one of those pussies.  Yeah.  Walked around, that's the whole thing. 
[02:59:30]  I'm a liberal.  I'm a nerd.  I can't get any chicks.  I'm an ugly little douchebag.  Oh.  Oh.  Liberal, self-righteous guy.  That's me.  I'm Mr. Self-righteous.  Yeah, very liberal.  That's him.  Very liberal.  It's easy to be liberal because you just take a stand.  But it's hard to be, I guess, a real dyed-in-the-wool conservative American like you.  Right, Jack?  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Absolutely, Jack.  You know, we join the military.  We do the right thing.  I know you do.  Yeah.  Faggots like you run around talking about sucking dick and taking it in the ass. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah, so what?  What do you fucking don't like when I tell Q stories?  Hold on, joke blocker.  Let my friends laugh.  Timing of diarrhea in the ninth inning.  Hold on, real red, white, and blue American BLEW.  I am a dozen for nothing.  You're just a little fool.  That's all you are.  I am.  But you know what, stupid?  You listen to me.  So sit in your car, bitch boy.  And keep your fucking ears to me.  How many priests fucked you in the ass there, dickhead?  Can I answer your question? 
[03:00:30]  Can I?  Hold on.  Hold on, fake angry white guy.  I don't know their fucking is.  Is that why you hate Christians?  Let me.  Oh, I don't hate Christians.  Oh, you're Mr. Liberal.  Listen, man, you're done.  You know, you're done.  But you're still going to listen, aren't you?  You're so easy.  You're still going to listen.  There's a million of you out there.  Good.  Yeah, a million tranny lovers.  We should rise up and help the transsexuals get what they deserve, which is big hugs.  I'm Mr. Self-Righteous.  Ooh, Jimmy, everybody's a racist, and that's my thing.  Everyone's a racist? 
[03:01:00]  What?  You're done, man.  Nobody cares.  But you do.  You called up and you needed to talk to me.  Nobody cares.  You care.  You're still great.  Shh, Jack.  You care.  I can feel it.  I can hear it in your voice.  I upset you.  And that's what I wanted to do.  Have a nice day.  No, not really.  Did he upset you?  I don't think so.  But by the way, for a real military guy, you think like a woman.  That was a military guy?  Yeah, we joined the military.  But it's like, then you call up and go, I just wanted to affect...  That's a fucking chick thing to do.  By the way, at Joe underscore trucker. 
[03:01:30]  At Joe underscore trucker.  Thank you.  All right.  We'll get a lot of lovely...  Let's say hi to Cameron.  Joe the trucker?  Toronto.  Cameron.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hi, Cameron.  Hey.  This is Socialist.  Hey, I just wanted...  Yeah, we are Socialist fucks up here.  I hate it.  Yeah.  All right.  I just wanted to know why Jimmy cares so much if people use an anonymous name online.  He's free to use an anonymous name online, too.  I'm sure Anthony doesn't use his real name on nigger mania. 
[03:02:00]  No, I actually, I'm not signed up to any websites.  I just visit as a guest on many websites.  You can even look at who I follow on Twitter.  You'll see, I actually follow a lot of militant black sites, horrible liberal sites.  So I do run the gamut to get my info.  Cameron, you don't see where that could be cowardly at times, though?  Yeah, no, it certainly can be cowardly at times.  But I think also what's cowardly is people going after it sometimes, overreacting. 
[03:02:30]  But I'm not saying go after it, Cameron.  I'm not saying that it should be not allowed what they're doing.  I'm just saying I personally find them to be cowards and fake, like, rebels and tough guys.  And it annoys me.  I don't think they're all cowards, though.  But I'm answering you why I don't like it.  That they wouldn't say in public.  But a lot of these people are saying things that they would say in public.  But they're too afraid of irrational backlash.  But I'm, uh... 
[03:03:00]  Yeah, that's definitely part of it.  I'm explaining to you why I hate it.  I hate it because, to me, it's symbolic of what we have become, which is just these fucking little pussies.  And the same mentality that hides their name on nigger mania or any other fucking radical site like that.  That mentality I hate just as much as the people who don't defend Stephen Colbert.  Or don't defend people who say racist stuff.  Like, we just all want to fucking sit back and protect our own little stuff.  And we don't give a shit what the next person has to deal with.  I agree with that, Jimmy. 
[03:03:30]  Hold on, sir.  Hold on, sir.  Could you hold on for one second, sir?  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Do you have an earpiece on your phone, sir?  I am just...  Hold on for a second.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on for a second.  Jimmy, what do you think about the people that black themselves out when they're doing an interview  because they feel they're in danger of...  Do you feel their pussies?  No, not at all.  Now, isn't that very similar?  They're afraid of repercussions based on who they are and what they're going to say.  That's true, but I think we understand the difference between the mafia killing you 
[03:04:00]  and I want to say nigger and I don't know how to say black on a website.  To me, there's a different thing that we kind of understand what the difference is.  Like, I'm not saying...  That, to me, I would be a fake if I said that.  Yeah, sure, you're a fake.  I wouldn't show my face if the cartel was after me.  You know what I mean?  No, I think that's a completely different thing.  But relatively speaking, I think some of the repercussions that you can get just by speaking openly about race  and religion or homophobia, relatively speaking, it could ruin your life. 
[03:04:30]  You're not going to get your head cut off.  I understand that.  But losing your job, maybe your family, maybe...  That seems to be pretty bad, too.  But there's also a lot of guys that are anonymous that they know damn well they're not going to lose their jobs  for what they're saying, and they still choose to be cowards.  I understand Jimmy's point.  That's true.  And then fuck the rest of us, then.  Because when Phil Robertson said what he said about gay people, I didn't like it or agree with it.  I still defended him.  And he never should have suffered a penalty for that. 
[03:05:00]  And enough people went on Facebook and said, fuck you, A&E.  And what happened?  They put him back on.  So if people would just stop sitting on your fucking fat asses and just speak up and go on Facebook  or wherever we can speak up, they would stop penalizing everybody.  But we don't.  We just sit there and watch it happen.  Could we secretly like it?  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  The latest one is Colbert.  How many people stood up for Colbert when all of them were out?  A lot of people did.  So it's proven that we could push back and get some things done.  He's almost untouchable.  Well, as far as Colbert goes, I was happy when he got in trouble. 
[03:05:30]  Because he makes a living mocking guys like old.  You know what we need right now?  A fucking fire in the door.  You want one more?  Charlie?  All right.  Let's go to Charlie or Charlie.  It depends where he's from.  Charlie, what's up?  Yeah.  Why are you guys so worried about being allowed to offend people?  That's what I don't understand.  Because it's not being allowed to offend people.  It's being allowed to voice your opinion.  But a lot of times your opinion will offend people regardless.  I understand that.  But why are you worried? 
[03:06:00]  If you're going to say something offensive, you should know that you may catch some shit  for it, like losing your job.  Let me ask you.  See?  He's bought into it.  No.  Who's judging what's offensive, sir?  Are you for gay marriage or against gay marriage?  I don't...  I could care less.  Okay.  All right.  Way to take it.  But let's just say you're for gay marriage.  And I'm for gay marriage.  That's a very offensive stance to a lot of people in this country.  So, like, you know, I hate gays.  Apparently not.  It's passing on every fucking...  But I mean, a lot of people find gay marriage repulsive on a fucking deep religious level. 
[03:06:30]  So, me being four is an extremely offensive opinion to those people.  No matter where you stand, you're offending somebody, sir.  Yeah.  So, who's judging what is so offensive that you should lose your job over it?  Because...  Well, so...  No.  What I mean is, like, with that website.  What was it called?  Young People's Color Mania.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That one.  Like, silly goose mania.  Why should you really be allowed to...  I mean, I guess you're allowed to...  How could you say, why should you be allowed... 
[03:07:00]  You should be allowed...  I've heard you guys say the N-word ten times in the show already.  Like, but that's, like...  In what context?  You know the context.  And you're saying...  Well, no, but people may be offended.  They probably will be.  But I don't care.  They probably will be.  But those are people that would be offended regardless of the context of the language.  Right.  If they're mad at me, instead of being mad at me or Anna, what they should do first is  write a letter to Nicki Minaj, who dropped it 40 times in a three-looking-ass nigga.  Yeah.  Which, by the way, phenomenal. 
[03:07:30]  You like that song, Jimmy?  I genuinely love that song.  Fucking non-mogul-ass nigga is the best thing ever said in a song.  I stand by that.  What's the phrase?  Look, and it's...  She says, you non-mogul-ass nigga.  Non-mogul-ass nigga.  I wish I could be...  I wish someone would say that about me.  Because it's what I am.  They do.  We're going to get that on Twitter now.  Are you good, Charlie?  Yeah, I'll tell you later.  Thank you.  Yeah, Charlie, Charlie.  He sounds like a young kid who doesn't get what faith of a speech really is. 
[03:08:00]  It really is adorable for how often people call up and go, hey, you old folks, and this,  that, or the other thing.  It really is this thing where you look at the youth of America and think like, oh, I remember  that.  They got them.  Anthony, the lives won.  They got them.  They beat us.  Whether it's dumbing down the education.  Yes.  They have the fucking microphone.  I think it's very hard for somebody who really hasn't been thrown into the actual workplace  yet and having a nice little job while you're going to school or, you know, your first job 
[03:08:30]  out of the gate.  It's adorable.  It's not the real...  You haven't been fucking beaten down yet by the actual economy of how this country works.  So, you know, you could voice your opinions, obviously, but they're not educated opinions.  You're ignorant of what it's like to be thrown into the American workplace.  I smoked on stage at Tampa.  Nobody's...  That's how tightly run the club is.  I smoked Thursday night, Friday night, first show Saturday. 
[03:09:00]  In between the first and second show, Bobby Giuliano, who was there every night, realized  I was smoking on stage for the first time.  And I'm not supposed to do it.  No.  And six people walked out because I was smoking.  Really?  Yes.  And they weren't even close to the stage because I would have seen them get up and leave.  But can you imagine that?  So, I'm just saying, I'm making a point about self-righteousness.  Yes, yes, yes.  Leaving a show because I had a cigarette on stage.  Because you had a cigarette.  So, obviously, they weren't affected by the smoke.  They just didn't like that you even had it.  That's my point.  Right, right. 
[03:09:30]  It's fucking like ideology.  Ooh, he's not on our team.  We're out of here.  This indoctrination going on.  It's been going on for years.  And it's finally picking up that steam enough where it's affecting you.  I'll quit smoking.  And affecting people.  I'll quit smoking when I see this smoke come off my cigarette, go up your nose and your  head explodes.  Then I'll believe in secondary smoke.  Then you'll put it out.  I'm told then, shut your fucking filthy crack.  You know how you know that it's just an arrogance against smokers, too, is because they're going  after the e-cigarettes.  Yeah.  There's a real arrogance.  That has nothing to do with the health threat. 
[03:10:00]  Where they're making it illegal in the park.  Yeah.  Because fuck your...  That's sick.  That's ridiculous.  It's a cottage industry.  E-cigarettes.  And how are e-cigarettes...  Affecting...  Yeah, you gotta...  Come on.  The non-smokers.  Yes.  It's an arrogance.  It is.  It's the thought that you got around our little fucking rule.  That's right.  We didn't want you smoking.  Technology got around it.  No, we still don't want you smoking.  The commercial.  It's a cottage industry.  They're having a ball.  The non-smoking...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  See the commercials?  Yeah.  It's been going on for 10 years now.  They're going on movie sets. 
[03:10:30]  Oh, the truth commercials.  Showing open hearts with pus coming out.  This is you if you have a candy cigarette.  Shut the fuck up.  That's way more offensive, by the way.  What, the actual visuals?  Yeah, when you're trying to enjoy a program.  They're having a ball with it, though.  They're fine with that, but then if someone does an Asian accent on a TV program, they're  going to find it.  Yeah, you're sunk.  Did you see the commercial for the fucking...  The cancer eating away the lungs?  Yeah, the lady with no fucking chin in the house.  You know, apparently smoking.  The finger's cut off.  You turn into Popeye.  You see how I'm going to...  You get the whole... 
[03:11:00]  I get it.  It's insane, though.  That's dangerous.  That's accepted, but language isn't.  That's crazy.  I'm telling you, kid.  Nick's going to be smoking at Caroline's this weekend.  No, I won't be.  I can't do it here.  Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  No smoking in New York.  It's nickdip.com.  He's got the podcast on Riotcast.  What else, Nick?  Yeah, nickdip.com, Riotcast, iTunes, I'm on Twitter, all the other shit.  Yeah, you killed it today, bro.  Oh, yeah.  A lot of fun.  I love it.  Love it.  I thought that was off, to be honest with you, but thank you.  No, fuck no. 
[03:11:30]  You were great.  Fucking love it.  I think we're done.  Jimmy, you got anything?  Yeah.  Just Tampa and Caroline's coming up.  Caroline's 24th through 27th.  Tampa, 11th and 12th of this month.  Are you being called a liberal on the...  I think it's hilarious, by the way, because Jim is so not a liberal.  But it's also, like, people are just such dummies.  No, it's two camps, and they throw you in one or the other.  Right, right.  That's exactly it.  I'm a hard right-wing fucking religious right guy.  Same.  You know?  Meanwhile, I am the furthest thing from that, also. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah, I get that.  I get it.  That conservative thing.  I don't even argue with it anymore, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, I just, yeah, okay, whatever.  Because of Patrice.  The shit I said to him on tough crimes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's got to be walking down laughing his balls up.  Dragging this fucking anchor around my neck for the rest of my career.  Do I love a good abortion?  Oh, I couldn't be happier that abortion's illegal.  You should have been one.  God damn it, a bear trap. 
[03:12:30]  I stepped right in it.  I thought I was pro-life.  And I was listening.  They were talking about abortion on the radio.  My car.  This is true, right?  There's 55 million abortions since Roe v. Wade passed.  And I was like, that's horrible.  Then I went to Dunkin' Donuts.  There's only one guy in front of me in line.  All right, maybe they have a point.  I'm not saying snuff out a kid's life so I can get my latte.  Maybe I am.  I fucking love it, man.  All right, well.  But I'm a conservative.  See you tomorrow.  Later, man. 
[03:13:00]  Welcome.  Welcome, welcome to the Opie and Anthony Post Show.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  866-969-1969 is the phone number if you want to be a part of this.  Call up now as we recap everything that happened on today's great Opie and Anthony show.  I told you DePaulo would be good, didn't I?  Remember in the pre-show?  Remember I told you Nick DePaulo does not have bad Opie and Anthony appearances?  Well, chuck another one up for the good guys. 
[03:13:30]  I see Roland outside in the hallway just holding court.  Can you see through your window, Sal, how ridiculous this looks?  What is it?  Let me see.  Look out your window.  And he's sitting there with all the little talent interns.  Some of the guys from Hits One.  Not like the mash-up people, but like the producers.  And he's just like center court of the whole thing.  Yeah, I got a good look.  Like a big giant court jester.  He lives for this shit. 
[03:14:00]  He absolutely loves it.  Just holding court.  How many times do you think he's said white glove in the past five minutes?  I've never seen anybody talk so much with so little to say.  Just nothing going on.  Or actually understood the least.  Yeah, no.  He's just mumbling.  He's just picking up on little segments.  I'd love to get him to talk about where he is.  Denny, come down here.  I want to hear what was going on behind the scenes with Roland and Denny today.  Amp brought it up. 
[03:14:30]  Let's go to Lou in Jersey.  What's up, Lou?  Sammy, what's going on?  Hanging.  Just wanted to compliment the entire staff on there and Nick DiPaolo for just being brave  and speaking everybody's mind.  It's 99% of this country that's sick of this bullshit.  And I happened to notice that there wasn't a certain caller, that Agatha bitch on Twitter.  She didn't really go into the show.  Maybe she's on hold now, but she's got about, what, 20 minutes left?  Yeah, I think Jim's right.  I think that Agatha is the woman who Ant argues with on Twitter. 
[03:15:00]  And Ant was talking about her today.  He thinks that she's real.  I think that she's not a real black woman.  And that she's trolling Ant. </pre>
