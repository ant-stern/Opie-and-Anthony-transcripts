<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly from one subject to another.  The show began with a phone conversation with Doug Stanhope, which centered on the absurd hypothetical: how many primordial dwarfs a person could fight before exhaustion. This sparked a discussion about the appearance of primordial dwarfs, genetically modified “twisty” cats, and a scathing critique of Chris Hansen and "To Catch a Predator," including Patrice O'Neal's opinion.  The conversation quickly devolved into graphic descriptions of various sexual acts, fetishes, and extreme pornography, with callers contributing their own explicit anecdotes and referencing specific websites.  A caller also mentioned a story from Chuck Palahniuk's "Haunted" that mirrored a personal experience.  The segment was overwhelmingly explicit and involved vulgar language and highly controversial discussions.

Next, a caller described a recurring, extremely painful medical issue: a disappearing urethra.  He detailed his ER visits, procedures involving scalpels and catheters, and at-home treatments used with his wife's help.  Humorous tangents included the size of medical instruments and the caller’s suggestion a dominatrix could improve healthcare.  The conversation transitioned to Valentine's Day cards, his failed marriage, and his negative feelings toward his ex-wife, whom he described as a “shrew,” recalling embarrassing public incidents.  He discussed his successful avoidance of fatherhood, a fertility clinic visit, and his overall feelings about the relationship.  A brief guest appearance offered tips on avoiding unwanted social interactions, including using fake phone calls and tongue-protrusion.

The show then moved to a discussion of using iPod earbuds as a social deterrent, followed by a bizarre news story about a wheelchair-bound child inexplicably riding on a semi-truck's grill at 50 mph.  911 calls were played, showcasing varying reactions.  Guest Billy Connolly promoted his zombie movie, "Fido."  A significant portion of the show focused on the hosts' "boiled meat barbecue," featuring ox penis, sheep testicles, duck feet, pig's head, and tripe.  The hosts, along with a somewhat intoxicated Danny (a staff member), and other guests, attempted to consume these items, their reactions ranging from disgust to reluctant consumption.

The "boiled meat barbecue" continued over multiple segments.  Patrice O'Neal and Baby Doll joined the studio for a segment focusing on the difficulties of consuming boiled duck feet and tripe, which was compared to English muffins.  The less repulsive boiled beef tongue (tasting like Canadian bacon) was also tried. Sam, a guest, repeatedly refused to eat anything he considered unappealing, sticking to his “eight-year-old diet.”  The challenges continued with boiled sheep testicles (compared to brain tumors or meatballs), eliciting gagging and vomiting.  Beef tendon balls (smelling like cat food), a “gooey duck” (a type of clam), a boiled pig's head, and ox penis were also consumed, all resulting in strong visceral reactions.  Numerous gagging fits and the use of a garbage pail were frequent occurrences throughout this extended segment, interspersed with advertisements.

A further "boiled meat barbecue" segment involved cow ligament meatballs, sheep tripe, beef liver, oxtail penis, and sea cucumbers.  E-Rock (Eric) reluctantly participated, along with a studio intern, "Duty Fingers" (Jared).  Caller Jackie voiced her disgust.  The hosts provided graphic descriptions of tastes, textures, and foul odors, with frequent mentions of gagging and vomiting. A sea cucumber chewing contest further emphasized the nausea and disgust. Patrice O'Neal was again a guest.  The segment concluded with the consumption of a boiled pig’s head, including its various parts. The show concluded with Opie discussing his childhood reaction to a school sex education film.

[00:01:00]  they are freakish alien looking things yeah they're very like they're squishy like they  they look like their parts are squished in a little bit like those twisty cats  what's a twisty cat twisty cat it was like a big news story uh uh several years ago where this woman  was breeding these cats that didn't have front paws their bones were missing from the front paws 
[00:01:30]  they were genetic defects that she was purposely breeding and they hopped like kangaroos on their  back feet missing bones how great is that how cute and why was she why was she doing this she thought  they were adorable i'm looking at twisty cats a quick google and there you go you can look at twisty  cast thanks to doug stanhope see and what they hop primordial dwarf i'll go to primordial dwarf in your google  search yeah yeah you've never seen one of these you've never seen anything more rapable than a primordial dwarf

[00:03:30]  think but if they're all coming at you from all angles you'd have to start helicoptering a few around  i think one of us one of us  great all right yeah so we're talking about primordial dwarfs and twisty cats today with  doug stanhope what's up doug hey good morning uh yeah i'm i've got my uh fake i'm awake voice on  yeah so do we 
[00:04:00]  are you in new mexico yeah arizona i'm at home okay also it's pretty early  yeah yeah so we're on uh dirty talk ona yeah this is filthy language uh radio it's good old filthy  talk fantastic just yeah hey we had chris hansen on we were trying to get a hold of you but uh it  didn't work out unfortunately yeah that was a wednesday i have these these wednesday drunk dial  nights now because i got last comic standing followed by chris hansen so it's like this double 
[00:04:30]  whammy of hate i drink through it and then i just i try to vlog but i can't spell so i just call  people go you might have to leave this shit god damn it yeah you don't like chris hansen oh no that  guy's just self-important fucking douche hole like that like self-important douche oh yeah he's awful  that show just fucking kills me it's worse fear-mongering than even terrorism because 
[00:05:00]  parents get so into that oh well if you watch that show you'll see that these pedophiles are more of a  problem yeah if your kid's sitting online going hi uh yeah hi random 55 year old dude i've never met  my name's britney i'm good i'm rubbing baby oil on myself by the pool god i wish i had a wine cooler  i live at 125 washington avenue christ i wish you'd just stop by if you're yeah if you make  yourself a pedophile's wet dream yes it's such fucking horrible entrapment like i'm not i don't 
[00:05:30]  think entrapment entrapment though is like come on if you're getting somebody to like approach you  as a pedophile it's almost like you can't trick a non-pedophile into trying to fucking a 13 year old  well maybe you can first of all fucking pedophile it means someone who wants to fuck pre-pubescent  kids that that's when you get a fucking hot chick like they have on there and they you know well you 
[00:06:00]  know what can i jump in uh patrice o'neill was in and uh he kind of made the point that they're  making these uh these girls these decoys just short of fuckable and patrice is like if you really  want to do this why don't you do it with 10 9 and 9 year olds but they're trying to kind of they're  kind of like tapping into the the i hate to say it's sort of the hotness of the whole thing that  it's a it's a 13 it's a 14 it's in that weird age for it don't apologize for it were you 14 once did 
[00:06:30]  you want to fuck okay then right did you know what you're doing yes you did basically what patrice  was saying you know they know exactly what they're doing by using that that weird age there you  know i mean if they really did it with like uh eight and nine year olds it would be so creepy no  one would yeah man you would just want to like shoot the guy when he walks in the door yeah  then you'd have a serious still wrong obviously i don't want to be jumping on the radio saying that  you know i'm condoning this but i mean i think patrice made a pretty interesting point you know because 
[00:07:00]  if you really want to take care of this problem you know set you know set it up with eight or nine  year olds but do they do predators really catch eight or nine year olds i think most pedophiles or whatever  probably don't go after eight or nine year olds online because the communication skills aren't  there like a 12 or 13 year old can sneak out meet you somewhere have a relationship online i don't  think an eight or nine year old can i mean they got to be taken from the house yeah i think most  times you got to meet them and most pedophiles or most victims of pedophilia they know their their 
[00:07:30]  attacker you know it's a family member it's not someone they met online because again you you don't if  you teach your kids even though the most basic skills we grew up without the internet and there  were just as many pedophiles they we just didn't have the internet and your parents dealt with it  by talking to you they'd go hey don't talk to strangers some of them might want to fuck you and  you go thanks dad i'm going to log that information in my brain and that's why you didn't you know get  fucked by a stranger that's why you got fucked by your uncle they never said don't talk to your uncle 
[00:08:00]  but yeah if you have just the most minimal parenting you're not going to do that online  but it's also hard go ahead okay i said it's also hard because it's like online you really think  you're talking to a 13 year old in person you know you're talking to a strange adult like they'll say  don't go up to strangers but you kind of know you talk your parents never say to you when you're a  kid never talk to somebody else your age who's a stranger they encourage you to make friends so it's 
[00:08:30]  like online it's a little bit different because you a lot of times think you're talking to somebody  who's 12 or 13 but you're really talking to a guy who's 50 that's the difference is the anonymity  typically you don't have in person that you have online i would love to do a reverse thing with like  a 35 year old woman saying god i really want to get laid by a 14 year old boy and just bust all the  sea of 14 year old boys who show up show up their dicks out you just touch their penises 
[00:09:00]  with lit match heads and say dirty boy and then watch it happen so much 20 years it's condoms what  were you planning on doing it's such a it's such a double standard though man i mean you know women  sleeping with uh boys of 14 or 15 we barely we barely blink when those stories hit the paper  hey by the way by the way squeaky wheel writes uh hanson explained that it's not entrapment because  they do not approach the pedos the pedos reach out to the plants unprovoked he did make that point 
[00:09:30]  on our show but even if even if they didn't even if they didn't you couldn't entrap me into having  sex with a 10 or 11 year old you just couldn't do it because it's not what i want to do like i always  kind of believe in entrapment but in a way i don't like if you're gonna do it man you're gonna do it  yeah it's like if they if they put dope on the table as a weak analogy but if they put a hundred  dollar bill on a bus bench and if they've vilified c's as much as they do pedophiles they go oh this 
[00:10:00]  person they they pocketed the hundred dollar bill well all right if you're gonna wave it around like  that you're gonna get takers but don't act like it's this epidemic that it's not well i'll tell you  the thing is though like with a hundred i mean i know i know you acknowledge a hundred dollar bill  is kind of an odd thing but it's like you know a hundred bucks is something anybody can use  fucking a child is something only a small percentage of the population comprehends most of us don't like  work 40 hours a week to fuck a child i said most of us you know occasionally it's a it's a fun thing 
[00:10:30]  and a stress relief who am i to judge asterisk and i know this borders on a nambla argument but  at what point are you an adult nature gives you the ability to bear children to be a parent  at roughly 13 years old at what point i and and the government says you're not even ready to drink  a beer till you're 21 like at what point is it bullshit like it naturally you don't want to fuck  someone way out of your age range that's natural i don't want to fuck a 15 year old for the same 
[00:11:00]  reason i don't want to fuck a 70 year old i have nothing to say to them you know but  i'll take the 15 year old over the seven exactly  hey reverend uh writes from north carolina just tell doug to shut up and view it as entertainment  i think even nbc would admit that it's gotten uh past the awareness stage of this show but it does  probably scare pedophiles though i guarantee you that that has changed the way they do things maybe  i mean i guarantee you there's less guys doing it because they're like fuck that man you can talk 
[00:11:30]  but you can't go over at least less guys doing it that way yeah hey doug yeah i'm  find that nice new way doug you got that computer go to uh break.com and type in to catch a chris  hansen he came in and anthony did chris hansen to chris hansen it was really really funny really good  you're gonna want to check that out oh by the way i just gotta acknowledge something i didn't i  didn't intentionally try to steal a lot uh uh a ron bennington bit so relax about what fighting things  like but it's people are just getting a run oh relax i wouldn't try to first of all i wouldn't try to 
[00:12:00]  like just casually steal a ron bit we traded that bit for big a and uh stalker patty there you go i'm  the one that mentioned that not ope and i've never heard ron bennington do that bit i i mentioned i  mentioned i could beat up 10 000 of them yeah ron talks about uh beating up kids oh really kids or  uh animals i love ron it's like uh how would you fight a giraffe oh you gotta choke him big neck you 
[00:12:30]  can't punch him in the face it's too high so ron's got his logic on how to beat things up but we're  talking about primordial dwarves and you know and they just keep coming like the matrix matrix too so  whatever dude i didn't try to steal a ron bit so relax you'll hear about this all my jimitorial  yes give the jimitorial what doug i'm sorry man i just got i had to free up the instant feedback  there doug because they're writing in like crazy and i i want to you know get some uh doug stanhope  and some feedback going here so that's all right i just didn't know if that was like a one of the 
[00:13:00]  characteristics of these primordial dwarves was they attack in droves no i think there's only someone  is reminding us there's only 80 in the world so that's 80 in the world so i guess unfortunately  it would be a very very short battle an extremely short battle that sucks to be that they must be  worth money yeah it's a collector's item yeah only if you could make them like what what's that what  was that book where they created freaks come on it's a famous book i shouldn't try to think at this

[00:16:00]  whatever old toilet games but she was talking about a doctor she used to see and what he likes her to do  was take a scalpel and put the scalpel in the tip of his cock and just hold it there and then yank it  out like not dig deep with it but just put the blade in all right and go and yank the scalpel up  and she said the thrill for this doctor because he knew it wouldn't permanently damage him  was that when he'd pee like for the next couple days he would feel it and remember that domination 
[00:16:30]  feel it and was talking about it like we've all like masturbate with shampoo and shit and something  happens where like a little gets in your pee hole it hurts and then all of a sudden you have to take  a leak like an hour or two later and it burns stings what is that about by the way i don't know  the inside of your fucking dick hole ain't meant for any fucking nothing dr sanjay gupta on line six  sanjay gupta my friend zul he was this biker comic dog he was really funny he was just a fucking animal

[00:30:00]  uh no i actually have a split cock  oh why  why oh it's awesome  why  but why  it's hard to explain it's uh i actually do the sounding the shoving metal things in there and stuff  and if you split up a little bit you can fit more in  oh that logic of course  but rob you're not explaining why like you're talking to a lot of guys right now and how does it get to a point where you decide  how do you get to a point where you decide i want a split cock  i've seen i've seen a few pictures of a split cock  and not even not even a thought of ever attempting this 
[00:30:30]  no  yeah i had a lot of gentle piercings uh i used to be a piercer for about four years i do sideshow performance now  and just seen a lot of guys  just figured it'd be cool to do and i did it and i really enjoyed it so  how'd you do it how'd you split your cock  uh it's uh it's uh underground surgeon type of guy  and it's just a scalpel you cut and you sew the sides together and it splits  how much does that hurt  no i gotta i gotta see three people just to get a xanax prescription  you know that's a tough one to write off 
[00:31:00]  the fucking insurances and medical necessity  i gotta get my dick split  do you have to use a rubber  it'd be weird to have like some kind of fetish or whatever like that that even me and norton go  i don't get it  yeah what the fuck  i can see a little log in the mouth  how do you fuck with a split dick  you carry around rubber bands  so it's you know i still get hard still normal but it's not tipped like in the end it's sort of 
[00:31:30]  hold on dude but when it gets hard what the fuck's going on it's split  oh no it's not split all the way  so it's still getting hard like a hot dog in a microwave type of thing  yeah but what about the tip like that doesn't get hard right  oh no don't you feel it  yeah blood flow still goes there  and aren't you worried that  all right now  it's like a moray eel  well i'm i'm thinking if it's split already  and you're having sex  aren't you worried that the damn thing's gonna tear  uh no not really i mean it's fully healed up so 
[00:32:00]  we've all you know we've all went for that piece of skin on the side of our nail  and decided oh i could i could take this off  next thing you know you got a long red strip all the way down to your elbow  ow i'm just thinking you're having a lot of sex with a split cock  you know it's got a tear  well also sex feels a lot better because urethra yeah it's a little sensitive  so sex feels a lot better for me as well  i love that sex feels better  sex is great the way it is i don't have to chop my cock into 
[00:32:30]  rob we're really trying to get into your brain here though  uh chris on long island he asked and i  we asked and you're still not helping us out here he goes what makes people do this  like all right there's a ton of people that do piercings  yeah  just one step further  more than one  yeah it's almost a slippery slope theory i'm not gonna split it anymore i mean i like where it is now  but it's just something different and i really enjoyed it so good thing  it's almost like cutting your dick off or like wanting to cut your dick off almost 
[00:33:00]  yeah you have a vein who have it done yeah  dude you have a vein in your dick right  there's people that are into that too  and the amputee  i'm not into that  yes  yeah we did the amputee fetish on the show it's hilarious  wait sir let me ask this i don't get like you know how when you come and you piss there's a hole  there's like the urethra how do you avoid splitting that like  how do you not gonna cut it like a straw  i don't know the urethra is split  do you come like a blender bus  well yeah i come  i guess i'm gonna be dropping sexism so 
[00:33:30]  girl girl gives me uh pleasure with her mouth  uh you could say whatever you want  she gives you a fucking blowjob  exactly  give me a fucking blowjob  you know i come  fucking come on the chin  she doesn't have to swallow it just hits her face automatically  because uh the shoot  the actual holes near the base near the balls  some was so  the hole  so you did it to be a gentleman  a gentleman  you you you come out of the hole that's kind of near your balls 
[00:34:00]  oh no i mean the urethra goes all the way in  so i'm on the urethra  i'm still at work  yeah  but when you shoot  you're shooting like halfway down your dick  yeah pretty much  i  that's fucked up right there  she must look like she's wearing a  a scuba regulator  sucking  both halves of your cock  going over her teeth  one way and the other  she's in the middle going 
[00:34:30]  what do you want from me  all right there uh  thanks rob  i'll show it to you  you guys can  oh great  i can't wait  thanks  all right let's say hi to uh  marcus in ashville  marcus what's up  what's up guys  hey man  what's up dude  hey um  when i was a kid growing up  there was this religious family  that lived across the street right  and so anyway  this kid was in the bathtub  and uh  he kept pushing his penis in  and kept pushing it in  and kept pushing it in 
[00:35:00]  anyway  the little thing didn't come out  and uh  the mom had to go in  and she tried pulling it  and tried  tried getting it out  anyway  he ended up at the uh  the hospital  and they had tweezers  trying to go pick this thing out man  but uh  pretty crazy  so uh  so you can push it in  but it could also get stuck  we're learning today  as a kid maybe  she should have put her mouth over it  and like  given some suction  and that probably would have  popped it back out  or she should have put things  in his asshole  and pushed them in and out 
[00:35:30]  really quickly  happened  a fucking screwdriver  and a hammer  or flicked his nipple  showed him tinkle videos  until his little weenie  just popped out naturally  so doug  how's butters  i just see him  on my message board  i i don't  i don't  i don't go out  when i'm in town  but uh  nah  he sends me emails  saying he wants to come over  and make us tamales  and i i i don't  uh i don't write back  so i would  you're not hanging with  butters these days huh

[00:41:30]  like ten I was  into ten year old  that's how it  worked  so I think  when I was  about ten years  old I had  this fantasy  of a girl  that was about  about four  inches tall  totally naked  and I wanted  to put her  in my mouth  and then just  pull her out  of my mouth  and kind of  suck on her  like a lollipop  you wanted to  be Danny  from The Shining  Tony's the  little boy  who lives in  my mouth  she's the  little whore  that lives  in my throat  but I wanted  to do that  with her  completely naked 
[00:42:00]  but really  little  what's wrong  with you  I don't know  that was just  a fantasy  that popped up  when I mentioned  like a little  I love the new  Anthony that  just decided  out of nowhere  to start sharing  some weird shit  with us  it's a little weird  but it's like  a tiny little  you know  this has been  happening  for the last  couple months  you're just  sharing these  weird things  she'd be tiny  but completely  naked  and alive  and completely  like you know  soft and  everything  and I would  put her in  my mouth  and just  go like  mmm  and then  pop around  my mouth

[00:43:00]  that Anthony  I want to  know  I want to  know of  Anthony's  dream  that the  little girl  you were  putting in  your mouth  was she  standing like  in a  thatch of  grass  with two  beanbag chairs  in front  of her  no  it was  a girl  not a  weenie  and it was  just the  thought that  like I  would feel  all of 
[00:43:30]  a naked  girl's  body  all on  my tongue  at the  same time  like her  ass  her stomach  legs  everything  all at  the same  time  and that  was like  like a  kid fantasy  I had  okay  terrific  it went  away  after a  while  I thought  it was  pretty cool  for a  kid  I thought  it was  pretty cool  for a  kid  little  fantasy  it's wrong  it's just  weird  it is weird  I'm not  saying it's  not weird  you guys  blow kids  under the

[00:56:30]  problem with this  video  pubes are dirty  lovely culture  just amazing  oh  alright  hey let's go  back to Ken  Westchester  so Ken has  this condition  where they have  to stick crap  in his urethra  because it  closes up  and some of  the instruments  are as thick  as a thumb  yeah no kidding  and how often  do you have to  have it re-reamed  well let's put it  this way  when it first  happened to me 
[00:57:00]  I had to go  every week  for six months  to have this  done  it's nine rods  one that starts  as the size  of your pinky  the width  I'm talking  right right  and kind of  stretch it  yeah  they stick it in  and they like  fucking twist it  to stretch it  back open  because the tissue  on the head  scars back down  so now they got  me to one month  what uh  what was the name  of the condition  it's called  urethra dilation  now I was  doing research  on it  on the internet  to like  so I can show 
[00:57:30]  people what the  fuck I go through  because everybody  says to me  oh it can't be  that bad  and if you  you know  the only  documentation  on the internet  is like  doctors pictures  and books  rather  of drawings  and they just  show like  a little stick  inside the  dick hole  which is  fucking  you know  ponderous  compared to  what they do  to me  it's crazy  dude how'd you  know there was  a problem  like you would  try to piss  and what  your dick  would blow up  like a balloon  or you want  to get into it  I'll get into it  I'll try to be  as quick as  possible  one morning  after a long  night of drinking  I woke up 
[00:58:00]  dude could not  fucking piss  I fucking  looked down  I'm weary  headed  I gotta hang  over  my hole  was gone  just gone  not there  no more  just gone  wow  it's like  your piss  hole was gone  it was over  it was like  somebody fucking  started it off  it was gone  I guess  it's kind of  like when  you had  an earring  and you  decided  the earring  wasn't cool  anymore  so you took  it out  and then  the earring  comes back  it's cool  again  so you're  like  you know  I have  an earring  hole  I'm gonna  fucking  put my  earring  back in  and then  you realize 
[00:58:30]  that earring  hole's gone  and you gotta  poke it through  your piss  hole disappeared  I swear to god  this is no shit  I mean I went  to the emergency  room  I was drinking  all night  so my bladder  feels like  it's gonna  explode  so they  take me in  right away  to the emergency  room  and it was  the most  embarrassing  thing of my  life  I got two  nurses  and a  fucking  doctor  who looked  like an  intern  trying to  fucking  use a  scalpel  to reopen  the hole  I'm sitting  there  they're like  here  control your  morphine  drip 
[00:59:00]  I'm like  okay  but turn  that fucker  up as much  as I can  and I'm  fucking high  as hell  and I got  my poor  pregnant wife  sitting next  to me  dropped this  whole thing  and they  finally were  about to  wheel me  into the  OR  to cut  my belly  open  I guess  to put  a catheter  in that  way  and thank  god  luck  fucking  the urologist  on call  walked in  there  threw  everybody  out of  the room  and he  was able  to get  a catheter  in me  drained  like  fucking  two bags  of fucking  piss  out of  me  and then  put a  catheter  in me  for three  days  I went  to his  office 
[00:59:30]  he did  the procedure  for the  first time  and let me  tell  I cleared  out his  waiting room  because I  was fucking  screaming so  loud  oh wow  it's  horrendous  man  I mean  if I  don't know  what  causes it  it just  happens  it happens  mostly in  older  gentlemen  let's say  that maybe  go through  it once a  year  just to  make sure  everything  is okay  I'm 33  years old  no I'm 32  years old  this happened  to me  when I was  28  29  there's no  drug in  the world  that could  prevent you  from screaming  on that  thing  oh here 
[01:00:00]  take a couple  of Vicodin  before you  come in  you know  that'll help  then they inject  laticane in  to numb it up  which it works  for the first  two rods  and then that's it  forget it  as long as I've  been doing it  you know  it's over two  years now  you think I'd be  used to it  you ain't getting  used to it  no matter  fucking what  will it heal  eventually  they say that  it can be cured  with surgery  I guess they  stitch it open  somehow  but this doctor  is saying to me  that well  you're a young  guy  if you fuck it 
[01:00:30]  up and it  don't work  then you're  going to have  to come here  every fucking  week for the  rest of your  life  I'd rather  wait  and I'm  thinking  how much  longer do you  want to wait  dude  it's been  like two  years  it was two  years in  May  how much  longer do you  want to wait  because this is  starting to get  out of hand  just have them  implant a straw  or something  in there  like one of  the ones  where you  can bend  the neck  yeah  bendable  straws  how comfortable  you think  that would  feel guys  better than  what you're  going through  whatever  go on for  at this point  but I mean  that can't  be comfortable  I don't 
[01:01:00]  think  too bad  that's like  you would  have won  the what  the hell  is that  competition  oh hell  yeah  that's a  that's a  biggie  disappearing  pisshole  disappearing  pisshole  beats  everything  I'll come  in there  with a  fucking  rod  tomorrow  and shove  it in  okay  give you a buck  how much rod  can you take  at this point  these things  I'm telling you  I have pictures  of my fucking  email  with Travis  or whoever  I have pictures  of rods  I'm telling you  they're 12 inches  long  and the longest  one  the girth 
[01:01:30]  I'm telling you  it's wider  than your thumb  look at your thumb  and just think  of it round  totally round  and he jams  them in  like all the  fucking way  I mean  it's like  it's gotta be  touching my  bladder at this  point  it's not  comfortable  I was gonna  come in  for a while  cause they  had me doing  it every week  and then they  were like  well come back  every two weeks  but here's an  at home kit  you can use  and I'm like  what  they're like  oh do it  every two days  I'm like  okay  so they give  me this little  plastic one 
[01:02:00]  it's probably  about you know  four or five  inches long  and it starts  off from skinny  and it gets  to be probably  about the width  of your index  finger maybe  and my wife  was doing it  to me  cause I can't  fucking do it  myself  see again  this is a  perfect place  for dominatrix  healthcare  good luck  to you  it would be way  better if some  chick in a latex  skirt was making  you eat her ass  while she  I'm gonna jam  this down  your cockle  if you don't  eat my ass  good  I didn't think  it was gonna be  good enough  for the  what the hell  is that contest  Doug 
[01:02:30]  he's on to  something here  dominatrix  health care  I like it  make those  freaky things  a little easier  at the very  least it should  be the name  of a punk  band  or something  alright Ken  thank you  we're looking  at the video  right now  of the bald  guy ramming  his head  into the vagina  it looks like  Bob Kelly  attacking an  ice cream cake  that is so  fake  that's fake  no it's real  I swear  alright Doug  we're gonna go  hey thanks for

[01:04:30]  they get  screwed in the  end  when you have  a birthday  very close  to a major  holiday  yeah  in the end  you save  money  because it's  not as special  maybe because  there's the  other thing  going on  so there's  like two  things  yeah  I put I  love you  of course  aww  but you don't  know what  to put before  that  dear  sweetie  baby  yeah  dear  not dear  not dear  baby  just  baby  blank  sometimes  you do

[01:05:30]  you  Jim  imagine  just putting  the most  heinous  valentine's  day card  and not  to somebody  that has  a sense  of humor  that would  get it  but just  really  to one  of these  like  house wise  that just  don't  have that  type of  sense of  humor  and just  put that  it seems  like it's  been a  lifetime  with you  you see  let's blow  up everyone's  oh my god  what is it 
[01:06:00]  I should send  one to my  mother  from my  father  yeah  oh I  didn't do  that  that's what  I was getting  at  we should  get all  our O&A  pass to  just  send out  cards  oh is that  great  write it  from  me  because we're  not gonna be  able to figure  out what  their real  names are  so just  write  from  me  I'm  sending in  this  this card  today because I  have to  from me  from  me  how funny 
[01:06:30]  would that  be  just a  mass  mailing of  valentine's day  cards  wait for me  in the  bedroom  I didn't  include a  vase  you know  where I  want to  stick  these  thanks  for  nothing  but you  wrote  something on  the card  just one  line  just one  quick line  yeah  because I  mean we  say nice  things to  each other  I'm always  like hey  you're nice  you're nice 
[01:07:00]  are you going  out  are you doing  anything  I don't know  if we are  tomorrow  I know for  the birthday  we're going  out to  dinner  yeah  I think  we made  plans  for  tomorrow  yeah  going out  on valentine's  day is  ridiculous  yeah  plus  you've  got to  go like  the night  before or  after  she told me  this weekend  I went to  a gig  so we'll  hang out  or go  very early  take a horse  ride  have a brunch  she loves  brunch  I hate it  I did a brunch  last year  it worked out  perfect  brunch stinks  unless you  drink  yeah  when you're  drinking  brunch is the 
[01:07:30]  best thing  used to do  brunch in  Huntington  yeah  right  kind of near  FH Riley's  over there in  Huntington  yeah  yeah  my brother's  restaurant  400 New York  Avenue  yeah  yeah  it was right  there  there was a  place for  brunch  and the  actual  food bill  was something  like 40  bucks  for like  four people  and the  booze bill  was  $380  and this  was Sunday  morning  yeah 
[01:08:00]  the  Bloody  Marys  he had a  drink  because he  was miserable  true  oh  did I  ever  now he  drinks to  have fun  yeah  this is  great  brunch  you piece  of crap  give me  another  mimosa  I'd like to  have a  mimosa tree  with you  wrapped around  it  it's an 
[01:08:30]  actual tree  she was a  shrew  huh  oh  oh boy  what  I mean  god  I can't  you know  when people  say  you know  usually over  time  you only  remember  the good  times  you barely  remember  those bad  times  so it  makes  like  nostalgia  seem  you know  you get  nostalgic  about things  and it  makes old  times seem  better than  they were  because you're  only remembering  the good  and not  the bad  I cannot 
[01:09:00]  remember  good  I have  no  recollection  of any  real good  times  but you  were married  for 10  years  10 years  not 9  years  9 years  and I  don't really  remember  I remember  having good  times  when I  wasn't  with her  like  like during  those 9  years  like hanging  out with  friends  doing the  show  things like  that  but I  don't remember  actually  sitting down  and having  one good 
[01:09:30]  time  not one  no that's  just it  I'm trying  to find  one  would you  be sad  if she  died  I will  be a  thousand  percent  honest  with you  no  I would  not be  sad  I don't  wish  death  on anybody  that's an  awful thing  to carry  around with  you  you know  so I  wouldn't  do that  honestly  but if  god forbid  something were  to happen  I wouldn't  be sad  about it  I wouldn't  be sad  would you  cry  no 
[01:10:00]  I wouldn't  go to the  funeral  I wouldn't  do anything  she's  nothing  to me  how much  time would  you spend  with the  news  with the  news  of that  particular  of that  event  yes  we're on  to something  else  what do you  want to  talk about  what would  your reaction  be  yeah let's  see you'd  probably know  first  why would I  know  because you'd  probably get  some kind  of message  from somebody  that knows  her being  in the  Huntington  circles  I don't know 
[01:10:30]  about that  you might  an old  friend of  hers  I honestly  don't know  what she's  been up  to  no no I  know but  if it's  something like  if she was  up to death  you might  get a phone  call  it might  be  maybe  what about  the what  about the  ex maybe  no  no  good  oh I  mean even  under that  extreme  circumstance  no  no  well she  might then  have someone  call you  probably  I don't  know  you'd  probably  find out  just because  of the  Huntington 
[01:11:00]  connection  yeah the  Huntington  thing  you're in  the bar  business  so you  know they'd  all go into  mourning  fly their flags  at half  mast  half of them  would be out  of business  fly their taps  at half  mast  their taps  going out  of business  we can pour  beer and play  taps at the  same time  just see  bar for sale  bar for sale  sorry guys  only half a  beer for  everybody today  only pouring  half beers  half beers  today 
[01:11:30]  I'd go  I'd go  hmm  wow  how'd that  happen  yeah  and then I'd  be curious  as to how  it happened  and then I'd  go oh  well  I better  stop the  automatic  payments  here's a  question  if you could  choose  obviously you  would never  do anything  but if  you in  some grand  scheme  in the  universe  yes  could choose  how it  would happen  like say  God came  to you  choose how  it would  happen  this is your  choice  how would  you want  it to  happen  that's 
[01:12:00]  too much  responsibility  for man  for me  for one  man  man  if you  threw dice  onto a bunch  of different  choices  what choice  would you  want to  have  happen  I'd like  something  ironic  I'll call  on Greg  on the way  to the bank  trying to cash  an alimony  check  something ironic  I would like  something ironic  my pal  Anthony  would have  to be  something  ironic  something  a little  twisted  and ironic  where you  would have  to go  on the way 
[01:12:30]  that's kind  of funny  that's kind  of funny  I didn't  want to say  it but  you don't  want to look  like a complete  ass so you'd  be like  that's kind  of funny  if you think  about it  isn't that odd  she was going  there  you know  she didn't  make to the  bank  does that  mean that  that's hers  wait the bus  she was on  to go to  the bank  with the  big check  did what  wow  that's kind  of funny  that's kind  of funny  and interesting 
[01:13:00]  so what's  new  happy  valentine's  day everyone  happy  valentine's  day  I can't  remember  one  good time  I just  don't  that didn't  involve  like  other  other  people  and the  good time  was with  the other  people  and drinking  and you  know  hanging out  partying  and things  like that  this was  just an  incidental  cancer 
[01:13:30]  right  an incidental  cancer  on the  good time  malignant  tumor  on the  good time  that could  not be  removed  and still  is there  isn't it  nice to be  in a happy  and healthy  relationship  yes  do you write  romantic stuff  on cards  I can't  picture you  being romantic  me  you'd be  very lovey  and dovey  but do you  like actually  sit down  and write  something  isn't it  lovey  dovey  how could  you be  lovey  and dovey  could someone  just be  dovey  that's silly 
[01:14:00]  if you're  just dovey  without being  lovey  you're kind  of a faggot  and you like  birds at the  same time  you're just  cool  I'm being  dovey  honey  and then I'm  gonna crap  all over your  patio  you'll put  up plastic  owls  to keep  me away  how'd you  know the  noise  doves make  I don't  know  I've shot  a few  in my  day  used to  go dove  hunting  in California  twist their  little heads  off  and skin

[01:20:00]  fingers  themselves  giant  claw like  that you  usually see  on big  fat  african  american  women  I would  go with  two to  three  two inches  huge  easily  two inches  huge  did you think  it was kind of  cute  no  never liked  the nails  did you ever tell her  hated the nails  why would I want to  invite that  upon myself  why  opie  would I invite  that hell  upon me  um  hey  you know  something  here's my 
[01:20:30]  opinion  why don't you  sit down  and have a  shot  I mean  let me  uh  I don't  I've seen this  by the way  and would always  have to try to  soften the  beaches  before he had  to say  something  that might  be  construed  as controversial  unpleasant  unpleasant  I know  there was a  phase back  in the 80s  at some point  let her  let her drink  a little  take a few  more sips  now I've  had my  drink  I  I  I know  uh  the 80s  at some point  in the 80s  it was kind of  in  to have 
[01:21:00]  long nails  a lot of  girls had like  these talons  for a while  um  it's now  1996  uh  maybe  you should  cut him  down a little  you could still  have like  nails  and go to  the nail  place  and  and  you know  have  them done  get the  manicure  and everything  and  and paint  them and  everything  but maybe  they could  be a little  um  shorter  to 
[01:21:30]  oh  short like  your  is that  how long  you want  them  as big  as that  excuse  for a  now  now  now look  there's no  need to  get  personal  it's just  my opinion  the people  I see  really don't  wear nails  like that  anymore  so  why don't  you go  yourself  I'll wear  these  look how  about I  chase you 
[01:22:00]  around the  house  and go  to scratch  your eyes  out  with the  nails  I hope  this is  funny for  others  happy  valentine's  day  head  I  lived this  wait  oh with  the nails  so  she would  never  like really  compare  like make  fun of  your size  would she  no no  I was  kidding  about that  I know  how that  affects  the fun  drained out  of the room  for me  no no  I just  thought that  would be  the ultimate  insult  for me  I don't 
[01:22:30]  even really  remember  the  wouldn't be  insult  she wouldn't  really insult  me as much  as just  get belligerent  and there  wasn't  if there was  an insult  it would  kind of  be refreshing  because it  would mean  there was  a thought  process  going on  it was  just  these  things  like  yeah  why don't  you go  yourself  why  and then  I try  to be  reasonable  logically  tell me  try to  tell me  why I  should  go  myself  like why  are you  saying that 
[01:23:00]  I did  nothing  10 minutes  ago  everything  was fine  now  I should  go  myself  what  happened  in those  10 minutes  10 minutes  5 minutes  whatever  it is  you could  go  every minute  see you're  not making  sense  I'm not  making  sense  you're  not making  sense  what  changed  I really  tried to  get it  what  changed  over  10 minutes  besides  10 shots  I don't  mean to  laugh so  hard  this is 
[01:23:30]  like  he's  he's  nailing  this  like  you  wouldn't  believe  and I  logically  try to  explain  how many  times did  I  didn't  work  and I  used to  hang out  a lot  back in  the day  and  socially  how many  times did  I look  at you  and go  what  what  happened  yeah what  happened  everything was  just like  comfy dory  what happened  I went to  the bathroom  so many  times  I'm there  I'm watching  the same  stuff  I'm like  what happened 
[01:24:00]  did you  like  sign something  to her  I did  nothing  I did  nothing  and it  would be  just like  hi  all of a  sudden I'm  like  what happened  like Dr.  Bellows  you'd be  like  but  just a  second ago  and then  but  Major Nelson  I looked  over here  and she  was fine  and I  came back  and she's  belligerent  what happened  Major  but then  I  I saw

[01:25:00]  congrats  I was your  pal back  then we  would drive  together  I've said  this before  we would be  pulling up  to Ant's  old crib  and I go  you want to  take a ride  around the  block  and he goes  yeah  maybe we  could stop  off at the  bar  and then I'd  go  so do I  yeah  little does  the world  know what's  going on  they think  we're just  rock stars  so do I  oh  it was  miserable  I was  so miserable 
[01:25:30]  it would  be  completely  it was  it was  completely  done  like it  was just  it was  just  done  people  thought we  had the  greatest  lives  well you  know  career wise  of course  we did  yeah  of course  we did  but uh  there were  times where  all I  wanted to  do  was like  not be  in that  house  and uh  I'd walk  in  and  oh  remember  the candles  she thought  that was  going to  save the  marriage  we would 
[01:26:00]  pull up  to the  house  she thought  this was  going to  save the  marriage  we would  show the  candle  I forgot  about this  oh it was  horrible  we would  pull up  to the  house  and there  would be  candles lit  all over  like all  over the  house  and for  a split  second  of joy  I thought  the place  was in  flames  and it  wasn't  it wasn't  Hanukkah 
[01:26:30]  it wasn't  Hanukkah  it's not  Jewish  it's like  why the  candle  I asked  I'm like  Anthony  what are  candles  doing  all over  the place  like  the lights  are all  out  because  we  you know  obviously  we did  afternoons  so when  we get  home  especially  in the  winter  it would  be dark  out  yeah  we'd  finally  make it  back to  Huntington  around 11  I don't  know what  the hell  time it  was  but we'd  pull up  to the  house  and it's  just lit  up like  when Carrie  got back  from the  prom  you know  I could 
[01:27:00]  see your  dirty  pillars  let's go  in the  closet  and pray  so he'd  pull up  to the  house  and I  would  just go  oh no  I'd go  oh no  it's candle  night  she thinks  this is  gonna do  it  lighting  candles  she thought  that would  like  make the  whole scene  romantic  meanwhile  romance  was the  last thing  what was  waiting for  you inside  I never  asked you 
[01:27:30]  that  the  candles  dinner  and then  frolicking  if she  wanted some  type of  frolicking  but what  I would  do  would be  eat dinner  the candle  light would  kind of be  disturbed by  me turning  the television  on  and then  I would  work my  way over  to my  desk  going  blowing out  the candles  to the  desk  boot up 
[01:28:00]  half life  and play  because that's  what you had  half a life  that's what I  had half a life  you had half a life  wow  maybe that's why  I enjoyed the  game so much  so you figured  might as well  play the other  half online  oh  you just hear me  walking  blowing out  candles along  the way  it's over  Johnny  I'm the potty  pooper  that's me  shut up  you don't want  to make love  oh dude  make love  stop it 
[01:28:30]  pulling up  and he would  just have  this look  on his face  like oh  no  oh no  oh Jesus  no not  candle night  not candle  night  because in  order for  there to  be candle  night  I think  she would  have to  be half  in the  bag  so it  was  candle  night  and  and  you'd  come  high  how you  doing  doing  a lung  test  yes  let's  see how  many I  could blow  out  in one  breath  did you  say I  love you  a lot

[01:29:30]  love me  followed by a  back at ya  kid  back at ya  kiddo  well  happy  valentine's day  let's wrap it  all up by just  wishing everyone  for tomorrow  happy valentine's  day  no it doesn't  stop during the  commercials  I was gonna say  just in case you  were wondering  he hasn't  stopped  I finally had to say  whoa whoa  save it for the 
[01:30:00]  air  it doesn't  stop  Jimmy asked him  a question  Jimmy what was  your question  again  I don't  remember  what was it  oh uh  did she ever  embarrass you  in public  oh yeah  yeah  like you  said  she would  start drinking  I'm like  did she ever  embarrass you  in public  by the way  this is  the Opie  and Anthony  show  yeah  it was  it was  like her  job  it was  an occupation  it was her  job  to annoy you  in public  the public  embarrassment  factor  yeah  yeah  again  it was  you know  hanging out 
[01:30:30]  at a bar  or something  and she'd be  fine  a couple  of drinks  and then  wham  it would  just hit  and it  was over  it was  just  you know  a totally  different  person  and uh  I bring up  one time  at the  Fire Island  uh  used to go  out to  Watch Hill  out there  take the  family boat  nice  big  what was  a 30  38 foot  sea ray  nice boat  take it  out there  and just  park it  in a slip  and sit  and party  all weekend  long 
[01:31:00]  it was  good times  go out  with the band  we'd set up  and uh  do a gig  at the bar  over there  and had  some really  good times  over there  and it  would just  always end  up again  in one of  these fiascos  and the thing  about the uh  the boat  getting on it  um  now this  had been  going on  for years  uh  my mother  and sal  and everybody  all the  friends  had been  going to  Watch Hill  for years  and they  all had  their boats  all the  friends  had boats 
[01:31:30]  and uh  to get  back on  the boat  from the  dock  there's  a little  gangway  this thing  is probably  a couple  of feet  wide  and it  would go  from the  dock  to the  back  of the  boat  and you'd  walk up  it's very  short  the boat  is backed  right up  to the  the dock  so it's  very short  but you had  to walk  over to  get to  the boat  well  one evening  uh  as she was  walking back  onto the  boat  we uh  hear a  splash 
[01:32:00]  she fell  off the  gangway  into the  green  sewage  water  that everyone  dumps their  their crap  boxes from  the boats  into  you know  their baby  diarrhea  all the  crap  that comes  out of  the boat  out of  the bilge  oil  and gas  I'm sure  yeah  she comes  up looking  like one  of the  Exxon  Valdez  penguins 
[01:32:30]  just full  of oil  and crap  and gook  actually I  think someone  had to stick  their hand  in and grab  her and  pull her  out  and the  wall of  these docks  that when  they go down  below water  are just  stuck with  barnacles  so she  tore up  the side  of herself  so bad  and it was  the water  so murky  that it got  that cat  scratch red  you know  and when  you get a  cat scratch  it's like  oh it's a 
[01:33:00]  little scratch  and then  the next  day  ah  medic  looks like  your arm's  gonna fall  off  that's  what it  was like  over one  whole side  of her  body  just fell  right in  tipped over  I was watching  the whole  thing too  she just  walked  kind of  went  like  sideways  whoop  she  splashed  down  right in  there  got pulled  out  I  fell in  the water  yes you  did  I can't  believe  I fell  in the  water  I can't  yeah I can't 
[01:33:30]  believe it  either  it's terrible  did you try  to help  her out  no other  people were  there to  give her a  hand before  I could  actually get  over there  Natalie would  really  I was actually  looking for the  keys to start  up the  engines  ants on  the dock  wait for  it  what are you  doing  what are you  starting up  the  propellers  could be a  little  dangerous  but that's 
[01:34:00]  she embarrassed  you  oh  because she  did that  that would  be an  embarrassment  yeah everybody  was watching  no one  the thing is  no one had  fallen off  of this  thing in  years  I mean  it's something  you just  didn't do  and people  believe me  were hammered  it's something  you knew  when you  walked up  that gang  way  even if  you know  you were  all teetery  on the  dock  you kind  of lined  yourself up  and then  ran for  it  so like  sheer momentum  would carry  you over  how far  of a walk  was it 
[01:34:30]  it was  probably  three feet  at the most  from the dock  to the back  of the boat  three feet  over a two  foot wide  gangway  that you  would  kind of  run up  you know  when you  got to  get across  something  that's  slim  you kind  of  if you  run a  little bit  you get  across  it easier  than if  you tried  walking  across  that's  kind of  what you  did  you just  kind of  gave it  a little  hop  skip  and a  jump  and you're  on the  boat  and wham  halfway  through  it's like  she's  on the 
[01:35:00]  golden gate  bridge  it's a  gangway  and bam  right down  into the  water  oh what a  great moment  that was  memories  soaking wet  and bleeding  and bleeding  with oil  all over  her  would she  ever start  shit like  around your  family  Jimmy's a  potty  mouth  I love  it  what happened  there Jimmy  what do you  say Al  I hope you  got it Al  but he's 
[01:35:30]  $40,000  you just  saved the  company  40 G's  Al  $350,000  what do you  say Al  he got that  I'm sure he  did  that's an  easy one  that's easy  that's pop  fly  boring  I'll catch  this with  one hand  one hand  looking down  on the run  as I'm  looking at  the babe  in the  stands  you're 
[01:36:00]  running back  to the  dugout  because you  know the  ending's  over  just grab  it  I thought  this job  would be  a challenge  anyway  what were  you saying  Jimmy  I know  your mom  and I know  Sal  and I'm  saying  would she  ever get  weird  or uncomfortable  on your  family  loud and  embarrass you  and start  to fight  oh  yeah  god  that had  a start  let me  think  oh  at my  wedding  I kid 
[01:36:30]  you not  she got  into this  screaming  match  with my  brother  at your  wedding  at my  wedding  to the  point where  my mother  went  what the  is wrong  with her  this is  wedded bliss  this is on  the wedding  did your mom  say that to  you  yeah  she goes  what the  what the  yeah we got  it we got  I got it  I got it  she'll be 
[01:37:00]  what the  is wrong  with her  I was like  oh well  and then you  know it  started my  nine years  of making  excuses  that was it  I'm glad I  got to start  on day one  my nine years  of making  excuses  well you  know it's  big day  had a little  bit to drink  so you  know  a little  nervous  yeah  that  oh  because  apparently  my brother  was trying  to pick  up on  her 
[01:37:30]  one of  our  cousins  that were  down  from  Massachusetts  isn't that  what your  family members  are supposed  to do  at a  wedding  of course  it is  check out  the new  talent  of course  of course  sneak into  the bathroom  and make  water heads  right  you pull  the old  sunny  corleone  up in  the bedroom  that's what  weddings are  for  so Joe  is  sunny  yeah  be right  town  so Joe  scooping  out  the  talent  yeah  yeah  and she  for some  reasons  found this  disrespectful  scooping 
[01:38:00]  out  whatever  scoping  scoping  I meant to  say sure  scoping  out the  talent  scooping  wow  dude  yeah  I think  you didn't  do an  incest  reference  about  families  that aren't  related  I enjoyed  that actually  but it  didn't make  sense  because  Anthony's  family  wouldn't  have been  related to  her family  so they  wouldn't  have made  water heads  I just  I was  totally  true  both of  us  went down  together  you were  thinking that  brother Joe  was picking  up his  own  cousin  so what  happened  so Joe  was like  trying to  pick up  someone from  her family 
[01:38:30]  yeah  yeah  yeah  well  believe me  it's Joe  would have  just been  you know  thank you  good night  so yeah  she found  this like  disrespectful  to do  on the  wedding  day  this  grandiose  wedding  yeah  this  grandiose  class  wedding  was not  a time  or place  to try  to pick  up  a family  member  this  grandiose  wedding  it was just 
[01:39:00]  like  Princess  Diane's  wedding  oh  of course  had all  the features  only wish  it ended  like hers  her life  this  grandiose  wedding  flesh  weren't you  like married  in a basement  or something  a basement  it was  the actual  wedding  took place  in Northport  as a matter  of fact  right down  the road  I wouldn't  know this  until later  but right  down the  road  from  Opie's  house  in Northport  where  you were  living  when you  were working 
[01:39:30]  at BAB  which church  wasn't a  church  it was a  justice of  the peace  that lived  down there  it was some  guy's house  I went  to a  guy's  house  to get  married  to get  married  and this  old guy  comes out  of this  back room  with his  wife  that he  just  banged  no no  he's like  some old  guy  they're probably  swingers though  maybe  this is how  they pick up  maybe  you never  know  and uh  so he  comes out  blah blah blah  blah blah blah  blah  everything was  signed  and that's  it  I was  married  I was 
[01:40:00]  hoping like  I would  read in the  paper that  he was a  fraud  like for  years I  was looking  for his  name  please  like like  fraud  justice of  the peace  how many  wedding  marriages  aren't real  and I'd be  like oh  please be  this guy  please be  damn it  you're looking  at the  certificate  hoping they  spelled  anthony wrong  yeah just  kind of like  when you get  a parking  ticket  my car's  red  wow this is  a blue  car  I'm out  got my  age wrong  this is  great 
[01:40:30]  so justice  of the  peace  yeah  and that's  how the  whole thing  was supposed  to happen  but then she  started getting  this bug  about you  know well  my mom  wants to  come down  and see  and then  because that  mom wants to  come down  that you  know then my  mother has to  see because  she'd feel  left out  and then if  these two  are going to  be there  then this  one  and before  you know  it  there was  a lot  of people  with nowhere  to go  for a wedding  because I  didn't have  the proverbial  pot to  in or a 
[01:41:00]  window to  throw it  out of  as they  say  so we  had this  huge bunch  of people  and nothing  to really  do with  them  no planning  went behind  this so  it was just  like ah  we'll go to  the bar  my mother  works at  and set up  some kind  of chafing  dishes  with some  ziti in  it  yeah  bon voyage  couple  have a good  one  godspeed  some ziti  and a  carvel  wedding  cake  there's  nothing  worse  than  barziti 
[01:41:30]  barziti  i was the  only one  with a  fudgy  the whale  wedding  cake  that was  me  and it  was married  to north  port and  honeymoon  to  east  north  port  honeymoon  in  comac  what a  mess  yeah so  that was  that was it  it was a  justice of  the peace  and then  the big  argument  because then  we all  went back  to the  house we  were living  at  and there  was a  carryover  of the 
[01:42:00]  party  there  and that's  where the  big blowout  with my  brother  happened  and I'm  making excuses  already  like oh  yeah well  you know  how it is  but no one  your brother  he wasn't  disrespectful  he was just  trying to  pick up  no  it had  nothing to  do with  just trying  to pick up  a girl  at a wedding  nothing to do  with being  disrespectful  it's just  it's what  guys do  at weddings  first of all  it was not  but you know  this is the  unreasonable  thing I was  talking about  right 
[01:42:30]  and she went  up  that's right  oh my god  it's all  coming back  to me  it wasn't  only  because my  brother  was at the  point where  he just  you know  turned around  and said  you know  something  you  and just  walked away  from the  fight  oh boy  so she  walks up  to my  mother  my poor  mommy  is sitting  on a  couch  with duct  tape  on the  arm  in a  house  full of  cat hair  in this 
[01:43:00]  little  crap hole  basement  apartment  she's sitting  on this  couch  and my  brand new  bride  walks up  to my  mother  gets right  in her  face  and goes  your  son  is a  and my  mother's  just like  sitting there  and looks  at me  like  excuse  me  you know  I  been 
[01:43:30]  been around  a few  too many  years  have to  put up  with this  kind of  Anthony  didn't you  learn from  me  yeah  didn't you  learn from  me  right  she started  yelling at  my mother  calling my  brother  an a-hole  and I'm  like oh  my god  oh boy  this is not  going well  how glad  are you  more booze  how glad  are you  that you  never had  kids  I could 
[01:44:00]  not be  happier  and how  do you  escape  that one  I don't  know  luck of  the draw  my friend  fanny  your face  luck of  the draw  fanny  your face  well we  know what  Ed shows  back to  Zha Zha  rules  how fanny  your face  how long  did you  date this  chick for  because I  didn't know  any  I don't  know any  of your  it was  let me  think  but you  don't  know his  ex  no I  met her  one time  at your  dad's  wake  actually  it's the 
[01:44:30]  only time  I ever  met or  saw her  I didn't  know what  she looks  I wouldn't  remember  when she  walked  in this  room  was she  surprised  you  weren't  serving  cocktails  Jesus  so how  did you  escape the  old  children  I don't  know  I honestly  don't know  you figure  nine  well eight  years  just the  luck of the  draw I guess  timing  because at  some point  because she  wanted to  have kids  too  so at one  point we  went to 
[01:45:00]  this in  Boston  went to  this  fertility  clinic to  see if  one of  us had  a problem  and  you know  I had  to give  a little  sample  and they  checked it  out and  mine  checked out  fine  they're like  look at  them  look at  them  they're  swimming  there's  plenty  of them  it's like  a party  going on  they all  got goatees  they're ready  to go  they're ready  to go  they're ready  to fertilize  maybe they  knew  they saw  one of them  held all of  them back  wait guys  boys  stop in 
[01:45:30]  your tracks  look  I know  you want  to do  this  the egg  is right  here  but I  implore you  don't  touch it  it will  be years  of misery  turn around  and go  back the way  you came  C-A-M-E  Al  oh it's  the same  way isn't  it  you think 
[01:46:00]  they would  try to  just avoid  it all  together  and go  all right  look  aim for  the  thighs  it was  it was  one of  those  situations  where  yeah  I got  checked  out  and then  I guess  we never  pursued it  past that  as far as  checking out  to see if  everything  was okay  so she  just assumed  you were  the problem  I don't  know 
[01:46:30]  well you  were always  the problem  in her  perhaps  perhaps that  was it  I was just  the problem  in her eyes  what I could  do  no right  right  that was  pretty much  it  I can't  get enough  of this  I can't  comprehend  it  because it  just  it keeps  happening  see you  know how  I can't  comprehend  a lot  of the  things  this is  how I  feel  when you  talk  like you  can't  possibly  this is  what it  looks like  is this  a tranny  story  this is 
[01:47:00]  why I  don't know  why  and  I don't  know why  I stayed  in it  that long  it just  it just  years  kind of  went by  and then  once the  radio gig  came along  I was so  fixated on  that  that it  just didn't  matter  I could  care less  who I was  married to  at that  point in  my life  that's what  I tell  people  because they  asked me  because I 
[01:47:30]  stayed in  my relationship  way too  long  I think  Aunt and I  were in  the same  place  and we  were going  for this  radio  goal  that it  was like  problems  but whatever  just focused  on our  careers  I might have  been out of  my marriage  sooner  if I  didn't  get into  radio  I think  I might  have been  out of  it  sooner  but who  knows  we were  taking on  the world  so it was  like  all that  crap was  secondary  I'll get  to that  eventually  when you 
[01:48:00]  get a big  gig you don't  need a major  personal life  change  sometimes leave  the status  well that  didn't even  matter  either  especially  we had  just gotten  the gig  and everything  and it was  brand new  radio to me  I'd never  done it  before  so any  problems  in the  marriage  was offset  by I  don't care  I'm friggin  going to  a dream  gig  and honestly  if we were  in good  relationships  we would  have still  had to put  all that  on hold  and make  some sacrifices 
[01:48:30]  because this  was it  it was  happening  we were  in the  moment  it just  made it  easier  because that  was what  it was  you know  what I  mean  we had  to work  our asses  off back  in the  day  now we  don't  work at  all  this is  beautiful  wedding  day  I can't  believe she  yelled at  my mother  on our  wedding day  how long  did you  forget about  that  oh right  right  right  it had  to be  about  let me  see  just short  of a year  oh wow  it's kind of  short of a  year  what happened  yeah  it was short  of a year  that we were  going out 
[01:49:00]  but again  I had said  before  I had thought  it was time  you know  for me to  get married  I was  I had to  be a big  boy  I had to  be an  adult  I used to  go down  to the bar  where my  mother used  to work  and sit  down  and everybody  that was  there  I was still  like Rosie's  kid  you know  I was like  hey Rosie  get your  kid a drink  and it's like  I'm still  I'm Rosie's  kid  like I'm  not a guy  I'm not  going to be  a guy  until I  start doing  like  I'm not  going to  be a man  guy  until I  start doing 
[01:49:30]  man guy  things  and getting  married  is one  of them  so I  figured  now is  time  to do  that  you know  get a  house  do things  that you're  supposed to  do when  you grow  up  and then I  realized  oh this  growing up  crap is  for the  birds  I'm going  to stay  a man  child  okay  there's a lot  more to get  of course  there is  first I can't  believe he was  a codependent  I can't  believe Anthony  was a codependent  this is ours  I have to say  how did you ask  how did you ask  I can't picture  him being  oh that  story  it's just 
[01:50:00]  stunning  oh we've  told that  one  it's ridiculous  it's one of  the saddest  most  ridiculous  unromantic  stories  we gotta save  for another  time  we're late  we gotta go  sell some  more crap  we'll be back  hey we should  get Billy  Connolly in  for this next  story  the story  of the day  definitely  he's  yeah  god he did  our show 
[01:50:30]  I don't know  a while ago  on XM  way too long  ago  and then I think  we got a  phoner from him  we love this guy  Billy Connolly  is hilarious  and he fits in  perfectly with  this radio show  and he had  that observation  about how we  just beat up  our listeners  and he thinks  it's brilliant  does he know  we're on XM  we're not on XM  right now  so we can't curse  well you know  it would be good  if in the green room  maybe somebody  Billy  there he is  the gathering  of the work 
[01:51:00]  shy  how are you  good good  come on sit  down  take a seat  we figured we'd  get you in  because we're  about to do  the story of the  morning  and I'm sure  I saw you all  in the news  oh yeah  yeah that was  us accepting  the Nobel Peace  Prize  I believe  nothing beats  the phony  phone call 
[01:51:30]  that was a  phony phone call  when you don't  want to draw  attention to  if you ever  don't want to  draw attention  to yourself  in any situation  regardless if  it's news cameras  or just at a  party or something  you take out  your cell phone  and just start  blathering into it  it's a wonderful  thing  it's great  because people  won't talk to  you when you're  on the cell phone  you know what's  funny I took a  phone call and  Anne took a  phone call while  they were filming  us I did mine  first and I  didn't know that  you did it first  and then I said  hey you know  I took a fake 
[01:52:00]  phone call there  I did the same  thing we should  have just called  each other  and just started  chatting about  our walk  an old actor  told me once  on the set  he said if you  don't want anybody  to talk to you  if you're looking  at your script  or something you  don't want people  to bother you  put your tongue  out  really  yeah if you're  reading your script  you stick your  tongue out  people don't  approach you  when your tongue  is sticking out  yeah your tongue  is a sort of  barrier  it must be  something like  I'm really  concentrating  or it's just 
[01:52:30]  it must send  some weird  signals  or it's intrusive  that now  that tongue  that's just  kind of relaxing  and hanging out  is going to  have to be used  if I come over  and he's talking  like a fleshy  warning  yeah yeah  a fleshy  warning  isn't it  you know what  I do when I  go to the gym  now  I wear the  iPods  you know  the buds  or whatever  and it's  attached to  nothing  the other end  is just in  my pocket  I swear to God  no one bothers  you though man  oh that's excellent  that's a good one  on days I don't  feel like listening  to music  I still put the 
[01:53:00]  buds in my ears  and it's just  dangling in my  pocket  attached to nothing  the last time  I was home  in Scotland  I saw a couple  in the street  a young guy  in his 20s  with his wife  and she was  pushing a baby  in a chair  but he had  the iPod on  and I thought  he's walking  along with his  wife and his  kid  and doesn't  even want to  talk to them  or hear anything  they have to say  that was horrible  that marriage  is doomed  to last forever 
[01:53:30]  yeah  I use the phone  for a lot of  things  my cell phone  like if I'm  walking down  the sidewalk  here in the city  and there's  somebody  I just don't  like people  behind me  when I'm  walking  like if they're  right behind me  if I could see  a little out of  my peripheral  vision  I'm okay  but right behind  me kind of  freaks me out  a little  so I'll take  my phone out  and make like  I dialed  and start talking  and step to  the side  and stop  because I think  like I could  do without the  phone  but if I do  then I'm  thinking  that person's  gonna think  that I'm 
[01:54:00]  stopping to  let them pass  me because I  don't trust  them behind me  when the fact  is that's  exactly what I'm  doing  but if I pull  the phone out  it's like  I'm making  a phone call  don't worry  just pass me  I could do  this without  you feeling  that I'm  being prejudiced  or something  you know what I've  done on the  phone  I swear to god  I've gotten  weird vibes  I've actually  been faked  on the phone  and said  look I can  see your  window  I know  oh like  they're watching  you so you  don't get  attacked  oh is that  horrible  one day  our phones 
[01:54:30]  are all  gonna just  get snatched  from us  for pulling  them out  for safety  that's wonderful  hey nice phone  alright we gotta  do story of the  morning  yeah this one  and it's not  Paris Hilton  whatever  that's  a lot of  outrage that  she's been  let out  very very  early  and now  is under  house arrest  in her  mansion  I wish  it was  Paris Hilton  that would  have been  interesting  a 911 call  about how  a tractor  trail is  leaving a  slug trail  behind  you hear  about  wheelchair  kid  on the  front of  a semi  no  this is 
[01:55:00]  a freak  accident  that  could never  happen  like it was  a perfect  chain of  events  I don't know  if they  describe how  it happened  in the  story  or  I think  the kid  was  we got  the news  story  to bring  everyone  up to  speed  but I  think he  was trying  to cross  the street  and you  know how  tractor  trailers have  to make  the wide  kind of  turns around  there  and he  couldn't see  over the  front of  his cab  and actually  bumped into  the kid in  the wheelchair  but hit it  directly in the  back of the  wheelchair  and then 
[01:55:30]  got around  the turn  and cranked  up to 50  miles an  hour  the kid  is sitting  in the  wheelchair  on the  front grill  of this  semi  doing  50 miles  an hour  did you hear  the update  with that  though  it turns  out that  the truck  was off  and the  kid was  just  wheeling  and was  very strong  what a  strong kid  how far  did he go  five miles  about five miles  actually he made it to the toll booth  and they wanted him to pay extra for the extra axle  and that's when he knew  that something was amiss 
[01:56:00]  I saw the story  and I saw the kid  and I'm thinking it's going to turn out to be the greatest day of his life  a lot of people are like can't believe it happened but I think in the kid's eyes he's like this is the coolest thing that will ever happen to me  he's an injured and all that  yeah he wasn't even injured and the chair is fine  and he just like flew 50 miles an hour down the highway just in his wheelchair  you know what a rush that would be like  he had dead bugs all over his door 
[01:56:30]  seven inches of dead bugs  well here's the story to bring everyone up to speed  and then what we got  up to speed  good one  yeah there you go  and what we got which is different than anyone else talking about  we got the 911  911 calls  where you'll notice  you'll notice the 911 calls  some people are cut out  to handle catastrophes  on 911  they know how to get the facts out  very calm  cool  collected  and other people 
[01:57:00]  lose their minds  oh you mean people actually  at the accident  yeah they saw  they were standing on the side of the road  saw the tractor trailer  and they're sitting there going like  oh my god  there's a wheelchair on the front of us  with some kid  flailing his arms  who's going to believe you  exactly  I would think it was like a movie stunt  or something  I wouldn't give a second thought  I'd be like  especially New York  there's no way that just happened  I would think it was a hood ornament or something  hood ornament  alright here's the news story 
[01:57:30]  it's quick  a Michigan man in a wheelchair  got the fright of his life  when a semi truck  took him on a wild ride  Ben Carpenter was crossing the street  when the handlebars of his wheelchair  got stuck in the truck's grill  the truck driver then pulled out  without realizing  he had an unwilling passenger  and he headed down a highway  at 50 miles an hour  a crossing driver called 911  and four miles later  a cop stopped  four miles  he went four miles  that's a long long way 
[01:58:00]  do you know how long that is  for him sitting there  it must have been like  this has to be an hour  this has to be an hour  that went by  the trucker  like probably a lot of people  are beeping at him and stuff  he's like  why is everyone beeping at me  what is your problem  he's just like  yes you too  I know how this goes  yeah right back at you  hey you bunch of asses  alright I'll let him by  go ahead  go around me idiot  and the cop pulled him over 
[01:58:30]  and he's like  get off the chair  come out with your hands up  here's the rest of the story  a cop stopped the truck  well that was pretty scary  it was  well I was saying help  yeah  I was saying help  no one could hear me  amazingly Ben was not hurt  and his wheelchair  survived the entire ride  without any damage  I love his voice  help  I was saying help 
[01:59:00]  you were inhaling help  no one  yeah  50 miles an hour  and no one heard him over  help  help  help  help  help  people were going  hey he's already in a wheelchair  what's the big deal  oh god  it's going to try to do  correct the spine  I know 
[01:59:30]  you think this song  went through his head  little Jerry Reed  from Smokey and the Bandit  oh  now  we gotta get this cripple  from Texarkana  to Georgia  oh my god  that's right  and of course  a Jackie Gleason song  passed by  that's an attention getter  it certainly is 
[02:00:00]  what we're dealing with here  is a complete lack  of respect  for the law  yeah  yeah baby  oh my god  you gotta see the video though  I mean when you see this kid  you're gonna realize  this will be the greatest day  of his life  it was the most  the greatest day  of my life  hey uh  breaker breaker  an old turnip leg grill  breaker breaker  you had to see the smoke 
[02:00:30]  coming from his hand  and the wheel  to the wheel  I still love the bizarre  hood ornament  Rich Voss  yeah that's Rich Voss  oh god  oh  playing uh  stress factor  this weekend  tomorrow  tonight and tomorrow  New Brunswick  oh my god  well uh  this is only the first part  of the story  so then the 9-1-1  calls come in  we should probably  take a break  or we're gonna rush  through this  yeah we gotta get  the 9-1-1 calls  yeah cause they're  they're just terrific 
[02:01:00]  they really are  and then we'll check in  with uh  Danny and Sam  they're out there  with Patty  yeah  she's having a birthday  shopping spree today  on us  I forgot to give my money  though  what are the odds  does she have enough money  no I've gotten better  Rich  she's got 50 bucks  yeah but that was  40  by the way  did you make the  egg salad sandwiches  no  you made them  yeah why not  I make  yeah  oh yeah  yeah  we were  Billy we were  playing golf recently  and uh 
[02:01:30]  and Rich  packed me a nice  little lunch  to have  after 9 holes  an egg salad sandwich  well I'm not gonna  bring my own sandwich  and not bring your  sandwich  am I cheap  you're cheap  that's cheap  you gotta go  and get something  at the clubhouse  I did  I insulted him  cause I'm like  I don't like  egg salad  it's 95 degrees out  so I got a nice  grilled chicken sandwich  and he was insulted  what are you  grandmother  I was like his date  or something  oh that's what  cause I did  I ate it  and I was like  why was there  an extra egg salad  oh you ate it 
[02:02:00]  after it sat  in like a golf bag  in the heat  and then I fainted  later that year  yeah no wonder  you fainted  yeah but he had  like little  like little  trail mix snacks  and little  napkin  for each sandwich  he has a little  cooler  a little drinky  I think it was  like a sippy cup  drink for us  first of all  a little checkerboard  sheet so you could  set up a picnic  I brought a basket  it was very thoughtful  I did return  tell him 
[02:02:30]  alright we gotta  take a break  you guys organize  which goes into a story  alright we'll take a break  and Billy Connolly  what are we promoting today  a zombie movie  yeah  yeah my new zombie movie  comes out  on the 15th  it's called Fido  Fido  yeah that's my name  I'm like a boy's dog  I'm his pet  the family pet  it's a zombie  alright we're gonna  talk about that  a little more  I'm reading a little  synopsis of it  it looks good  it's very interesting  we had a screening  the other night  and it was brilliant  it went down a storm 
[02:03:00]  yeah it's a comedy  with zombies in it  it's not a zombie movie  you can't go wrong  with zombies  that's what I always say  people love zombies  there's a whole  zombie culture  yeah  I didn't know about it  until I had to do  the interview  zombie magazines  people love zombies  yeah and they show up  like zombies at the movie  with the big holes  in the head  just our fans  they just want to say hi  alright we got so much  going on  why don't we take a break  we'll regroup  this is the worst  of the opening episode  on Sirius XM 
[02:03:30]  the virus  so the 911 calls  from the wheelchair thing  I just saw the wheelchair  guy on TV  they put mud flaps  on the back of his tires  I just saw  I saw the pictures  on CNN  his tires  were on the highway  the wheelchair tires  that's why I said  his hand was smoking  when he was holding  if you're just tuning in  wheelchair guy  trying to cross the street  truck doesn't see him  the handles get stuck  in the grill of the truck  and then he proceeds 
[02:04:00]  to go 40 to 50 miles an hour  with the wheelchair dude  on the front of his truck  down the highway  for 4 miles  4 to 5 miles  we had the story  now we got copies  of the 911 calls  because now this thing  is flying by people  and they're like  oh my god  we gotta call 911  it's like a FedEx commercial  we'll get your cripple there  in a day  the first job  yeah listen to this  911 call  911 emergency  I'm at the corner  of Hazen  and Red Arrow  there is a westbound truck  dragging a man  in a wheelchair  he did not see him 
[02:04:30]  crossing in front of him  when the light changed  he's out in front  of the middle school  right now  he's westbound  he's westbound  he doesn't know  he's dragging this man  ok we'll get help  on the way  thank you  yep  now you know  the man did not get hurt  he had the ride  of his life  you know  4 or 5 miles  50 miles  in front of him  this is just  an amazing story  that woman got a little  emotional  but she was able  to get the information out  right  she got it wrong  the truck was pushing him  not dragging him  right  so they're looking  at the wrong end of the truck 
[02:05:00]  and they go  there's no wheelchair  this is not him  this kid's on the front  alright let it go  so  she had a little panic  in her voice  right  what we're going  to learn today  is people  handle tragedies  a little different  that lady had a little  panic  but the next one  wow  the next one's  not a woman  you want to be  behind in any  emergency  on a plane  or in a fire  where you have  to get out  quickly  because she's  the one 
[02:05:30]  that they just  show screaming  and crying  in the middle  of a disaster  in everybody's way  right  911 emergency  hello  this is 911  where are you  I am on  I have no idea  I'm on  I'm in  I'm in  I'm in  obviously  I'm not in  all things  you're just  sorry  where's my client  okay okay  stop yelling  I can't understand  you  where are you  I'm sorry  I don't know  I'm in  it looks like 
[02:06:00]  I'm by the middle  school  oh my god  he's in a wheelchair  he went to  I'd hang up  on her  okay  on Michigan  Avenue  in front of  the middle  school  okay  what is  what is  your name  okay  we'll get  help over  there  sounds like  she's being  chased with  it  she couldn't  even get it  out even  remotely  where are  you  the United  States 
[02:06:30]  it's a  middle  school  it's a  child  if that  truck hits  somebody  who do  you sue  the trucker  or the  wheelchair  I think  technically  the wheelchair  rear ends  somebody  that's right  it's his fault  any idea  how the guy  got in the  wheelchair  in the first  place  like what  was  she's lazy  how'd he get  their bed  jeans  mother had 
[02:07:00]  one shot  too many  someone  didn't  didn't  stop  smoking  when they  were  supposed  to  fainted  in a  store  and hit  her  head  oh  no  wow  nice  callback  callback  of the day  how is  the guy  I mean  is he  completely  fine  they just  interviewed him  on CNN  we got  that audio  too  Ben Carpenter  was unharmed  but was taken  to a hospital  as a precaution  oh he has  a muscular  dystrophy  his eyes  are still  watering 
[02:07:30]  though  that's just  mean  oh by the  way  this is  Jen  continuing  with her  911  call  is she  driving  I have  help  on the  way  she made  it about  her  now the  911  operator  has to  calm  her  down  instead  of like  maybe  trying to  save  this  kid  meanwhile  this  guy  is  still  zooming  down  the  street  while 
[02:08:00]  this  woman  is  just  the  operator  should  have  egged  her  on  oh my  god  yes  we  know  the  case  he's  also  holding  puppies  and if  the truck  goes over  70 miles  an hour  you know  everything's  gonna explode  what  is  what  what 
[02:08:30]  direction  is  the  semi  going  did  it  go  west  by  Is it going out of town or into town?  It's going out of town, I believe.  Can you give me a description of it?  It was like it didn't have a trailer.  It was white.  Okay, white semi-tractor?  Yes.  It's got a wheelchair in the front.  It wasn't all in the trailer.  Okay.  Hold on.  Yes, it's a Kenworth.  It looked to be white with a bit of rust, and there's a cripple on the front of it. 
[02:09:00]  How much description do you need?  Yeah, really.  Truck, wheelchair, like end.  I know.  Like there's five of these out there.  They put one over the guy in the wheelchair.  He's like, no, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  I just decided.  It's going to work like this every day.  Right.  It saves on gas mileage.  It's terrific.  And if it's going out of town, that means it's going into town somewhere, too.  Right, right.  What's the matter?  He continues.  Good job.  Where are you at right now?  I'm standing like I'm just past Jesus Street. 
[02:09:30]  I can't see.  I'm like across from Game and Play.  Did she just teleport there?  She has no idea what she is.  She's terrible.  It sounds like we're always playing in Patty's buddy booth.  That's exactly what I was thinking.  That amazingly similar to porn movies.  Oh. 
[02:10:00]  Would it be great if you realized she was laughing?  Are you okay?  Yeah.  This is just a scream.  You'll never believe this.  This guy's in panic.  I'm sorry.  I'm trying to call you and take pictures with my cell phone at the same time.  My friends aren't going to believe this.  Oh, my God.  Some amusement parks can have truck wheelchair rides.  Hey, Kevin from Connecticut on the instant feedback.  Was the guy in the wheelchair going,  Wee!  Yeah.  That's right. 
[02:10:30]  Wee!  All right.  Finally, the last of this one from Jen.  There you are again.  She lost it.  Okay, Jen.  I have an officer in front of the middle school.  Where are you?  No, look at this one right now.  I just saw him turn around.  I'm like in any corner.  Like, I'm right in, like, the whole game insurance agency.  She saw him turn around? 
[02:11:00]  The cop.  Oh, the cop.  Yeah, the cop finally said,  Wow, I think I might have to stop that truck.  Why would 911 ask where the caller is?  They did.  Because she's panicking.  They're saying, Where are you?  They assume you're by wherever it is.  It's a problem.  Because she needs an ambulance, too, now.  For whatever's going on with her.  Lost her mind.  We're running out of show,  but they talked to the kid on CNN a few minutes ago.  First of all, tell us exactly how this happened.  Well, I was crossing. 
[02:11:30]  The light for the traffic was red.  I crossed in front of him.  It must have turned green as soon as I got out there.  Okay.  So he had no idea.  Right there.  Right there.  Sorry.  I drive in Manhattan,  and I can't stand pedestrians in the first place.  And if you're in a wheelchair or you're an old person,  this might sound insensitive,  but it's for your own safety.  You've got to look.  If that hand is flashing,  it means it's going to say,  Don't walk pretty soon.  Don't try to cross. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  Wait.  The second it turns green,  then you go.  Or you're going to end up getting run over.  Well, obviously, this kid has a death wish.  Anthony, that doesn't sound insensitive at all.  It is.  I understand what I'm saying.  This kid sounds like a rambunctious punk.  Last time, what happened after that?  You obviously became entangled in the grill.  And then, what did you do?  What?  By the way,  I put on my iPod and just enjoyed the ride.  What do you think I did? 
[02:12:30]  Exactly.  Mexican food and a flu.  You do the math.  So you think I did.  Let me tell you,  we're talking seriously bad hair.  What did I do?  I started yelling,  I'm planning my jump over the Caesars Palace fountains.  Right.  By the way,  this is the same CNN anchor  that interviewed Spelling Bee.  Spelling Bee, kid.  From earlier this morning.  She's got her plate full today.  She just knows what question to ask.  It would be a great ride at Disneyland,  wouldn't it?  Oh, absolutely. 
[02:13:00]  Here it is again.  We're running our show.  Just sit in that wheelchair.  Please to hail it back to the future.  Well, the good thing,  the people at the bus stop  didn't have to wait for that lift to come down.  Wouldn't it be funny if the trucker actually used,  like, stepped on the guy's leg  and then his face to get into his butt?  By the way, we got it.  Any freeze in there?  We got to speed up.  Old Buzzkill's going to be coming through that door any second.  He was uninjured  until the little metal bulldog fell on his head. 
[02:13:30]  A metal metal bulldog up your ass?  It's become one of those stories  about people who turn up at hospital  in the middle of the night.  You'll never guess how this bulldog  ended up here in the x-ray of my pelvis, sir.  I was crossing the street  when a tractor trailer.  Minding my own business.  Right.  When a reporter asked,  how did you feel?  He said, well, from the waist up.  I scuffed my previously unused sneakers. 
[02:14:00]  Not good.  Not good.  Let's try to get through this  before old Buzzkill comes through that Buzzkill.  What happened after that?  You obviously became entangled in the grill  and then...  How sensitive could you get?  Listen, you don't even realize how funny this is  because the same lady was interviewing Spilling Beat, dude,  with the same dumb, awful questions and observations. 
[02:14:30]  Is it true that a wheelchair kid  actually got caught in Tom Chiasano's braces  when he was walking?  What happened after that?  You obviously became entangled in the grill  and then, uh, what'd you do?  Well, I guess I just went along for the ride.  Oh, that's my hero!  I love this guy.  My hero is great. 
[02:15:00]  I love this guy.  What did I do?  I checked my messages.  I texted a friend.  What did you do?  I had flashbacks of how I got here.  I at last made a start on war and peace.  Well, I guess I just went along for the ride.  Oh, my hero!  Yeah, you're so cool and calm about it,  but you must have been terrified. 
[02:15:30]  No.  Yeah, I was.  Yes, but I have muscular dystrophy  and I can't do anything but this expression.  Are you paying attention, lady?  Yeah, really.  Did you see that happening to Stephen Hawking?  Please stop the vehicle.  Could you please stop the vehicle?  I was yelling for help.  Help.  Help.  Please help me.  Earth is doomed.  Let me see how fast I'm going.  Velocity.  Plus time.  Divide. 
[02:16:00]  Doing like a formula.  The driver's all,  why are you all up in my grill?  One more quick clip here.  The tickets are going on sale in seconds.  We've got so much to wrap up here still.  What did the truck driver say to you afterward?  I don't remember what he said.  Something about the mess and the hood of the car.  Yeah, I mean, I'm sure it was the,  it was the,  probably couldn't remember what was going on  because it was so overwhelming at the time,  but they say four miles,  hitting speeds of 50 miles an hour, 
[02:16:30]  and at no point,  the semi didn't hit anything,  and you're not hurt at all this morning,  are you?  At no point.  Did you crap your pants?  She just wanted to get something out of the car.  Yeah, he's trying.  It was a great ride.  What did the driver say?  Just leave the fuel and walk away.  Just walk away.  Lord of the wasteland, humongous.  Or if the driver came out and went,  you scratched my paint, clumsy boy.  Two days ago, 
[02:17:00]  I saw a rig that'll hold that cripple.  He probably came out and went,  oh, cripples.  Smokey in the burden.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  With that, we're going to wrap up.  This is the worst of the Opinetry Show  on the Virus Serious XM.  I got to get something off my chest,  so I'm going through my morning routine,  reading the papers,  drinking coffee, whatever,  and then I got to hit the bathroom. 
[02:17:30]  And all of a sudden,  I see Danny stumbling around  with no shoes on.  I think he just woke up.  I think he was sleeping on that couch.  What the F is going on  with this F in radio show?  What happened last night?  What happened last night?  And then I try to get an answer from Danny,  and he won't even talk to me.  And then he stumbles out of here  with his shoes and socks.  There he is.  Look at this kid.  What is going on? 
[02:18:00]  How are you doing, Danny?  I'm good.  What happened last night?  And why wouldn't you answer me?  Nothing.  We were hanging on.  It was Monday karaoke night.  Now it's a Monday karaoke night?  Yeah, with a live band  down at, what the hell's the name of that joint?  Arlene's Grocery.  Arlene's Grocery.  Yeah?  And you slept here last night?  A little bit.  I wouldn't quite call it sleeping.  What would you do?  I kind of just laid for a few minutes.  Cool. 
[02:18:30]  Why couldn't you sleep?  It was late.  What did you sing in karaoke?  What did I do?  I did Warpigs.  Oh, boy.  Yes, you did Warpigs.  Oh, man.  But you had a few more beers and shots.  Than you?  Yeah, I didn't have any shots.  I had a few beers,  but I kept looking at my watch  and going,  you know,  I gotta go.  Yeah, it's getting a little late.  I got a room,  so I'm just gonna go and crash. 
[02:19:00]  And Danny was like,  ah,  just drop me off.  Yeah, I came back here  and laid down.  This show sucks, man.  This show is a disaster.  Just falling apart at the seams.  It was the pre-4th of July,  pre-pre-party.  Well, traditional on July 2nd  to sing karaoke  and drink alcoholically,  which will kind of,  the vomiting takes you,  like bridges the third 
[02:19:30]  into the glory of the fourth.  We celebrate our independence.  All I saw was Danny walking around  with no shoes or socks.  I'm like,  that's the way to show up for work.  But then I found out  it's something a little different,  I guess.  How's things at home?  They're good.  As good as they've always been, huh?  Are you still hammered?  No, no, no, I'm fine.  You're totally sober, right?  I'm sorry?  You're sober.  Yeah, yeah, of course. 
[02:20:00]  Nice to lay on the answer.  Jesus.  I'm just very tired right now.  Excuse me?  Why?  That was fun, though.  Yeah, I had a lot of fun.  It was a good time.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  So let's go,  what do we got,  what do we got today?  What's going on here today?  I smell like,  I smell a hot plate or something.  What,  all right.  What are we cooking?  Boiled meat barbecue.  Right.  Yeah.  He was sleeping on the couch shirtless. 
[02:20:30]  I'm getting  communicated.  Oh,  so gross.  Was Danny nude?  Ew.  He was nude.  His cheeks are hairy,  awful.  With his hands between his legs,  just touching his junk.  Because it couldn't be warm in here at night.  No.  Are you eating some of this meat today?  Do I have to?  Oh, boy.  Do you?  Yeah.  What do you have?  I think,  I think,  I think it should be tasty.  Yeah,  gooey duck sounds great. 
[02:21:00]  Just,  the name just sounds delicious.  A little gooey duck.  Yeah,  so what do we got?  We got the boiled meat barbecue for,  for 4th of July.  We want a real barbecue,  but we can't have,  no open flame.  Yeah,  no open flame here in the studio.  So we said,  what the hell,  why don't we boil some just awful meats today  and have some of the boys try it out?  No spices,  nothing.  What could be the difference?  No condiments.  You get a nice boiled,  like piece of London broil maybe,  or a boiled chicken. 
[02:21:30]  It's got to be just as good as,  as a barbecued.  Nothing tastes good boiled,  except for maybe potatoes.  Yeah.  That is about it.  Yeah.  Ask the Irish.  Boil meat.  It just turns into this gray mess.  Danny,  we're kind of done.  You can do whatever you were doing.  They're just standing there,  awkwardly.  What were you doing,  Dan,  before,  before I'm called you in?  Sleeping.  But I mean,  I mean to work,  what were you doing?  What? 
[02:22:00]  Like,  what were you doing?  People,  whatever.  Back in the office,  I'm saying.  I apologize in.  Going through,  the normal routine of prepping.  Okay.  I don't know,  I'm never here.  What is prepping?  I come in at a quarter of,  so like,  what does that entail?  That's going through all the sites,  trying to find stuff,  and audio and junk.  What did you find so far?  Anything good?  No,  it's a very slow day.  Sam?  You're Travis.  What?  He's laughing, 
[02:22:30]  he's giggling like a girl.  Oh.  He's giggling like Travis.  So,  all right.  It's a slow day.  Slow day.  It's a slow day.  I'm sure Preston and Stephen Philly  are having a slow day,  and they,  uh,  just wandering around,  hungover all morning.  It was fun.  Got a,  got a little out of hand.  A little bit.  Yeah.  And they wouldn't call,  uh,  Danny up,  uh,  early enough in the set. 
[02:23:00]  Kept just passing by.  Getting these,  uh,  broads up there singing.  And then finally,  it was Danny's turn,  and then we left.  But my goodness.  What time did he just leave?  Took a long time.  Oh,  that had to be.  7.30 p.m.  That had,  I got back to the room  at about two.  About two.  Ordered something to eat,  which I ate half of  and promptly fell asleep  and the rest of.  Uh,  that woke me up though.  Then I had dessert. 
[02:23:30]  At two,  you were singing,  I was,  my girlfriend's furious at me  because at 12.30,  I,  I hate when I'm really tired  and I get into bed  and I,  I just know that she's got,  she's got things on her mind  because she's like all freshly showered  and looking,  and I'm like,  ugh.  Oh.  Don't get your hopes up.  I'm tired.  And,  uh,  she starts snuggling up.  Uh oh.  And the pants come off  and we're just laying  and talking.  I am such an old man.  She's laying on my chest  and I know she's horny  and I caught myself 
[02:24:00]  apnea waking up.  I was like,  ugh.  Oh no.  The apnea doze,  I slept to my back  and I kept apologizing.  Don't mind me,  I'm gonna just stop breathing  a few times during the night.  There's nothing  a woman wants to hear less  when she's ready for sex  than,  you know,  her boyfriend almost dying  from lack of air intake.  All right, 
[02:24:30]  we'll plow through this.  Thanks, Danny.  You're welcome.  Dan,  what's,  what are you,  are you gonna go up,  uh,  grab some audio?  Yes.  Oh.  Go to it,  Danny.  Danny's a trooper.  He'll pull through.  Oh,  he's got some laughs out.  Oh,  oh,  is that one of those?  All right.  Is that duck goo?  Gooey duck?  Look at the size  of that thing.  I've got a new respect  for the gooey duck.  Oh,  God.  I've seen that gooey duck 
[02:25:00]  in some movies.  It's white that big.  The tip's a little discolored.  What is that?  Ox penis.  What is it?  Ox?  Ox penis.  Is that one or two?  I think it's one.  Why would you serve that as food?  Like,  who,  yeah,  who eats that?  Oof.  There's plenty of parts  of an ox  that you can eat  before you get down to that.  That should come  after the hooves.  You better be really hungry  to have to go,  all right,  cook it.  Well,  that's being boiled. 
[02:25:30]  I'm sure that'll bring out  its natural flavors.  All right,  yeah,  so what else we got over there?  We have sheep testicles.  Pre-sliced.  Yes.  Nice.  Looks like there's  eight of them.  Wow.  Eight sheep testes.  How much are they  charging a pound  for that?  What is that?  Uh,  this was  $3.99 a pound.  That's not a lot of money.  The gooey duct  was $37.  But I'm talking about  for the testicles.  What the hell is this?  $17 a pound. 
[02:26:00]  Why?  No.  Are they rare?  This is disgusting.  What is that?  Comes with an iPhone?  And  boneless duck feet?  Wow,  that looks like potatoes.  Let me see that.  Ugh!  Who the hell eats this?  And how they get the bones  out of their  their little feet.  How they get the covering  like duck feet are...  The duck will fall down.  It's little  flappy feet.  Wah, wah!  You're just laying  all stupid.  You're trying to throw  bread at it.  Can't move.  Just collapse  on a sidewalk.  Let me take a look 
[02:26:30]  at the duck feet there.  Ugh!  It's the flippers.  They're like the...  That skin between  their disgusting  little duck toes.  These are  beef tendon balls.  I don't know  what they are.  I don't think  they're testes.  No.  But they're tendons  that have been  ground up and  rolled into meatballs.  Oh, there you go.  What is that?  A duck bill?  Is that a duck head?  What is that?  Smoked beef tongue.  That is the tongue 
[02:27:00]  of a cow  ripped out of its head  from the root.  It certainly is.  These are sea cucumbers.  That looks like liver.  Yeah.  There's a pound  of them in here.  There is a real  meat holocaust  going on  in this country,  in this world.  Ew!  It's a whole pig head.  Yep.  Wow.  An entire pig's head.  We're going to boil that today?  Did Danny bring it back  last night  after karaoke? 
[02:27:30]  Ugh!  That's got to be tasty.  Just boiling a pig's head  and then plucking  the meat off of it  and shoving it  in your mouth.  Dude, I don't...  This is awful.  Because there's...  What's that, Steve?  That's tripe.  That's a stomach  of cow?  Is that what that is?  Yeah, something like that.  A cow stomach.  Because unless this stuff  is prepared with like  different sauces  and cooked the right way,  it really must just  taste like crap.  But there is somebody  that would look at  all these foods  and go,  yes, I like that.  I like that. 
[02:28:00]  I've eaten that.  A starving Somali.  I can't picture anyone  in this country  eating this stuff.  What is that?  This is beef liver  and these are pig's feet.  Ah.  Delicacy.  Pig's feet,  quite the delicacy.  So what is...  Alright.  What are we starting off...  What time are we  going to start eating?  Well, they're boiling  the water right now.  What's the contest?  What do they win?  Nothing.  Oh.  They just have to do it.  Alright, we're off  to a great start. 
[02:28:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's our boiled meat barbecue  for 4th of July.  It's Rock Scream Tuesday.  It's Hummer Tuesday.  Alright.  We'll be back.  It's Opie and Anthony.  This is the worst  Opie and Anthony  Serious XM.  Getting ready for our  boiled meat barbecue.  Ah.  Some traditions.  Hey, just stand  the test of time.  Boiled meat barbecue  is one of them.  First year we're doing this, right?  Yeah.  We got gooey duck 
[02:29:00]  which is like  a clam  with a massive  massive appendage  that sticks out  of the damn thing.  We got sheep testicles,  ox penis,  boneless duck feet.  Well, you don't want  boned ones.  No.  Disgusting.  Beef tendon balls,  sea cucumbers,  beef tongue,  tripe  which is  downright disgusting.  I don't know  what the other stuff  tastes like  but tripe  is just god awful.  than a pig's head 
[02:29:30]  and the pig's head  still has the teeth.  Oh, it's a big  whole pig's head.  It's been cut off.  It's the whole head.  I had tripe  years ago  in some kind of  a spicy soup thing  and it wasn't bad.  It was cut up  real small.  It was in some kind  of spicy Mexican soup  so it wasn't bad.  Mm-hmm.  But boiled,  horrific.  It's just gonna,  all this stuff  boiled is gonna be.  Yeah,  because there's  only gonna be 
[02:30:00]  rancid like  taste  with this  horrid  boiled texture.  Not fun.  T-bone steak  boiled is disgusting.  Yeah, yeah.  Anything,  no matter how delicious.  Yeah,  take filet mignon.  Boil it.  There's gonna be  no spices,  no condiments.  What are we  dropping into the pot  first?  Have we decided?  And the funny thing is  we get cooks  in here all the time  and they can't wait  to get their plugs out.  Today,  I've been informed  no plugs whatsoever.  They don't want to.  No plugs.  They don't want to 
[02:30:30]  associate with this  officially.  They just want to  do their job  and get the hell out.  Yeah.  So what are we  dropping in first?  The ox,  um,  ox,  uh,  penis,  penis,  penis,  penis.  Which is a,  a delicacy,  um,  where?  No place around here  that I'm,  that I know of.  Uh,  then I think we're  gonna,  right after that,  we're gonna do  the boneless duck feet.  How would you,  uh,  how would you normally  prepare boneless duck feet?  I would never normally 
[02:31:00]  prepare boneless duck feet.  So boiling it to you  is fine.  Yeah,  we're gonna boil it,  we're gonna make sure  it's cooked and  How do you know  it's cooked?  You cut it in half  and what are you  looking for?  Uh,  you're looking for  the protein to be firm  and that the temperature  is where it needs to be.  Ew.  Hmm.  What does firm protein  look like?  Yeah.  Hmm.  Check your sheets.  It's kind of one of  those things that's hard  to actually explain.  I'd have to show it to you.  Okay.  What's the most  disgusting thing  there would you say?  Um, 
[02:31:30]  well there's quite a few  disgusting things.  I would say that the  boiled beef liver  is pretty disgusting.  Yeah.  Um,  liver's consistency  is very,  um,  like,  mushy.  Yeah,  and it's good to  sear quickly  but just boiling it  is not,  in plain old water  is not doing  anything for that  and,  uh,  I'm gonna say  that these sheep's  testicles are probably  gonna be rather  disgusting as well.  Hard to get down  I would think.  Yeah. 
[02:32:00]  Alright,  well drop something  into the pot  live on the air here.  What do you got?  Is the water  about ready?  Yeah,  we're good to go.  Alright,  we're good to go.  Ah,  yeah.  Here it is.  He's got two pots there.  One big cauldron-like pot  and then kind of a long  trough-looking pot.  Sorry.  He's opened up the trough one.  Is that the ox?  A couple of burners  underneath it.  He's going with the ox  penis right now  which,  which is,  uh,  rolled up like a cinnamon bun.  I'm sure it's not as,  it's like cinnabon.  I'm sure it'll smell the same.  That's an extra-sized, 
[02:32:30]  uh,  cinnamon.  Must have been a very  confident ox.  Yes.  He sure strode around  the farm.  Look at me.  You don't have to throw  the whole thing in there.  He's throwing the whole  thing in there like we  can't wait to get second.  Like,  people are going to want  more.  Hey,  where's the ox penis?  Who ate all the ox penis?  How long will that,  will that deliciousness  take to boil,  mister?  I'm going to say that  that's going to take  about 40 minutes.  Wow,  40 minutes?  We're not going to eat  anything today.  Do we have anything  that's going to boil faster? 
[02:33:00]  Yeah,  we'll get something in there  that's going to go quick.  Ah,  okay.  All right,  what are you throwing in  that's going to be quick?  That's going to be like  the tasty treat.  These duck feet are  going to go real quick.  Yeah,  they look pretty small.  What do they feel like  without the bones?  Oh,  look,  they're like,  they look like mushrooms.  Mushrooms are raviolis.  They're white like raviolis.  Yeah.  You know that hard,  like almost exoskeleton  that's on a duck's foot?  Has that been removed?  Uh,  yeah,  it's,  uh,  who knew there was meat 
[02:33:30]  in a duck's foot?  That is disgusting.  I don't know what it is.  It doesn't look like.  Wait,  they took the bones out  but they kept the webbing?  Well,  the webbing's the best part,  Opie.  Ugh.  That is really heinous.  All this food gives me the creeps.  It is so disgusting  that it's packaged  and people buy this  and eat it.  Whoa.  Take your duck foot  back with you.  He's photographing it.  How long do you expect  the duck feet to take?  Duck feet should only be  a few minutes.  Oh,  yeah,  duck feet,  that's cool. 
[02:34:00]  Whenever I order it,  it's a right out.  Yeah,  it's a little stuff.  Comes right out.  I think those are going to be  creepy to eat because  of the consistency  and because you realize  you're eating  a foot.  A duck's foot.  It looks like a foot.  I want someone to take  a bite out of the webbing.  Yeah,  the webbing.  Just gnaw on the webbing.  Looks rubbery,  too.  Yeah,  well,  how long is the duck feet  going to take?  I'm going to say  about 12 minutes.  Yeah,  you don't want to cook it  more than that.  It ruins it.  That'll ruin it.  Wow.  Yeah. 
[02:34:30]  All right.  So we'll wait for the  duck feet to boil.  The ox penis is boiling,  but that's going to take  about 40 minutes.  Oh.  I forgot.  I forgot.  It's Rock Scream Tuesday. 
[02:35:00]  I almost forgot.  Yeah,  let's go to Pittsburgh.  What's up,  Pittsburgh?  How are you guys doing?  Pretty good.  What's up,  Rob?  No,  we got a meow rock  screen for you.  All right.  Meow.  Meow. 
[02:35:30]  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  God,  he's doing eight  things at once.  Why did he put  meows in there?  Meow.  Let's go to New  Hampshire.  Jim,  what's going on,  Jim?  New Hampshire  does a better job.  Morning,  fellas.  Hey.  I was going to  give my rock  scream.  All right.  Got to get my  wind.  I'm off.  Oh,  yeah.  Meow. 
[02:36:00]  Meow.  Hey,  that's not bad,  Jim.  Seamless transition,  by the way.  Yeah.  Beating out  Pittsburgh today.  Let's go to Mike  in Buffalo.  Mike,  what's going on?  Yeah.  Wow.  There you go.  All right.  That didn't have  any buildup.  He went right  into it.  No,  he went right  into it.  Very good.  Very Judas  Priest.  Yeah.  I liked it.  Hopefully,  your personal  life's a little  different.  All right,  Mike,  thank you.  Have a good one. 
[02:36:30]  Yep.  I could barely  hold the phone  up.  He's so skinny.  Let's go to  the commish.  Commish,  what's up,  buddy?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  That's it.  Thanks.  Not quite the power  in that rock  scream.  All right.  Brian in Jersey,  what's going on?  Hello.  Hi.  What's up,  Brian?  This is Glenn.  Oh, Glenn.  What's up, Glenn?  Hey, how you doing?  I got a rock scream  from Woodbridge.  Okay.  Whoa. 
[02:37:00]  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  If it's going to be  the build or right  into rock scream.  Absolutely.  I like the build  because it's kind  of funny and goofy,  but I like the  regular rock scream  because it takes  some talent to just  bust it right out  without the build.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Great job there.  Brian, Dan,  whatever your name is.  Glenn.  Glenn.  Glenn.  What I meant was  who cares? 
[02:37:30]  One more from Michigan.  Lee, what's going on?  Yeah, I got my  rock scream here, boys.  All right.  All right.  What was that?  That was a caught  underneath a car scream.  The lift broke  while you were  changing something.  Scream.  Another one from Jersey.  Dave, what's up?  Here we go.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[02:38:00]  You went for the range  and the scream.  Very good.  Got to give it to him.  All right.  That was Rock Scream  Tuesday.  Pat from Monocci  coming in today  because he was here  yesterday and then  he had delivery to make.  He blew us off yesterday.  I saw the Nathan thing  on TV and he was  supposed to come in.  I think he's supposed  to come in today  and eat some of this  boiled meat for us.  Is that going to hurt  his chances for tomorrow?  Yes.  Big foot.  That's his life.  Is it?  That's his life.  It'll empty out his stomach.  Where are we at there, 
[02:38:30]  man that doesn't want  to be plugged?  We're coming along nicely.  Yeah.  Yep.  How are those duck feet?  Duck feet are,  they're coming along nicely.  I'm going to have  some tripe ready  momentarily too.  Oh, you threw the tripe in?  Sir, if they're all  being boiled in the same pot,  that's going to cut down  on the flavor.  Oh, he just dropped  the tripe on the floor.  Each one's going to  flavor the other.  Did you drop one  on the floor?  No, one slipped out  of the tongs  into the trash can.  It can stay there.  I have plenty more. 
[02:39:00]  Get a good one.  Are the duck feet  done there, sir?  Oh.  We'll get some  eating going  before the break here.  Oiled meat barbecue,  4th of July.  I would just say,  yeah, they're done.  How do you tell?  I don't know.  There's no way to tell.  He doesn't know.  That milk.  I can't drink milk, man.  It tastes awful.  Oh, God.  Oh, they're done?  He's saying yes.  What's the consistency  of them as compared  to a food that's  normally eaten?  What would you say? 
[02:39:30]  Like, hey,  calamar, baby.  Some calamar.  I would say it would be  similar to the consistency  of an overdone calamar.  Overdone calamar.  Look at that.  Hey, Vito,  you ruined the calamar.  Like, so what you're  saying is rubber bands  pretty much.  Pretty much, yes.  Very rubbery.  I'd love to ask  the group of people  that enjoy this type  of food why they  don't just eat good food.  Why would you look 
[02:40:00]  at a duck's foot  and go,  I have to eat that?  That is delectable.  What does it smell like,  E-Rock?  Hmm.  It's real.  I don't know.  Will you get your face  out of the duck's feet?  It smells like  chicken and dumplings.  I don't know.  Chicken and dumplings?  Or chicken dumplings?  Chicken dumplings, yeah.  Is this good  if you're on  Dr. Ian's diet?  I imagine it would be, yeah.  The duck's feet?  So who's going to  try the duck foot? 
[02:40:30]  Danny?  Yeah.  Start with Danny.  Oh, we should start off  with Danny.  Yes, we should.  Oh, no.  Yes, we should.  Danny's indisposed?  Where's Danny?  Oh, he's...  The word evacuation  is coming.  Oh, Jesus.  The what?  He's indisposed.  Not as in he won't come,  it's that he's unavailable.  What is he doing?  Is he in the bathroom?  Voiding, yes.  From which...  We don't know.  Someone go find out. 
[02:41:00]  Don't find out?  Could someone find out?  Ask him which...  If he can answer,  we'll know.  Yeah, if he can answer,  we know what...  Not necessarily.  I think you should  start off eating a...  A nice, tasty duck foot.  I'll take a nibble  in the meantime  if that'll help.  Is Danny in the bathroom  down the hall?  Yeah.  Oh, if he didn't go  into this one.  Yeah, no.  There's trouble brewing.  He knows better.  Oh, well, I see 
[02:41:30]  the big beef tongue  is being unwrapped.  Sir, will you be slicing  that up  for a faster cook?  I certainly will, Anthony.  Ah, see?  It's thin.  I know.  Yeah, slice it nice and thin.  What's going on?  Apparently, he's not  in the bathroom.  I don't know where Danny is.  Like a...  Holy crap.  Cheese steak.  Like a steak-em  made out of a tongue.  Oh, there it is.  Oh, wow, that slice is...  Why does that make  my tongue hurt?  Because he's slicing...  He's cutting a tongue! 
[02:42:00]  Because at one time  that was used to talk  even though it's  a stupid cow.  I mean, they have to  have some form  of communication.  What do they do?  Moodily-doodily-doo!  They just go,  meh!  I took a yank it right out  and they'd still go,  meh!  No, I think cows  have some sort  of a communication network  that will be affected  by the tongue  being removed  and sliced.  Wow, that is a...  You sliced that  like pepperoni, sir.  You're talented.  And that's going  in the pot of water. 
[02:42:30]  Some nice, uh...  little circles.  Of cow tongue.  Iraq is still  holding the duck foot.  Now, Iraq,  it's going to get cold.  Eat your duck foot  before it gets cold.  Bite the webbing.  Yeah, take it.  Bite in between its toes  where the duck  would have toe jam.  I was admiring  the traces of vein  in the webbing.  Oh!  Take a bite out of that.  Oh, is there veins  in the webbing?  Or what used to be 
[02:43:00]  the veins?  Just think of that  little fella  traipsing across the street.  Yeah.  That was underneath  and propelling him  in the little water.  Wow.  All right, here he goes.  All right, here he goes.  All right.  E-Roc with the, uh,  the duck foot.  Take a bite.  Oh!  Oh!  Don't you dare  waste that duck foot.  Oh, my God.  You eat that whole duck foot.  You took a big bite.  Oh, that face.  Oh, Jesus.  What, what,  what does it taste like?  His eyes are watering. 
[02:43:30]  You gotta finish it.  You ever taste  uncooked squid?  Ugh.  Oh, God.  The consistency  must really be awful.  You can't chew it  because it slides  in between the gaps  of your teeth.  I can't get it out  from the back of my teeth.  Bite number two  should be helpful.  Yeah, that might help.  You might want  to bite another one.  That might squeeze  the first portion out.  Bite the other webbing.  Yeah, get the webbing.  Well, that's what I did. 
[02:44:00]  I did the webbing.  Okay, get a big toe now.  Or you can bite  into its ankle.  I say he pops  the whole thing  in his mouth.  Oh, God.  And chews it.  Go ahead.  Pop it all in your mouth.  Well, get him  a garbage can, sir.  Yeah, garbage pail.  Get the garbage pail  close to the subject, please.  Is it cartilage?  Yeah, probably.  What do you think  held that little fella up?  Is there something in there?  Are you squeezing it out?  It was like a zit.  Oh, God.  It's like a zit.  It's coming out.  He doesn't want to let go.  All right, pop that thing.  Pop the whole thing  in your mouth.  Pop that whole duck foot  in your mouth. 
[02:44:30]  The whole thing  and just start chewing away.  Yep.  Hold it in your mouth,  suck on it,  and chew it.  A duck foot.  A-Rack's got the whole thing  in his mouth.  You wasted a perfectly  good duck foot.  No, I didn't.  Three more to go.  What's wrong?  What I spit out  of the duck foot  made up for the cartilage  that I just swallowed.  Oh, God. 
[02:45:00]  That's going to have a hard time twisting and turning around your digestive tract.  How's it taste?  Is it more the consistency or the taste?  I think it's more the consistency because it doesn't feel right being eaten.  It's not like food.  It actually kind of feels like it's still alive when you're eating it.  It's like moving.  Who else wants to try the duck foot?  Hey, Steve.  I think Danny's coming in now.  Where's Danny?  Nice.  I was told he was in the area. 
[02:45:30]  Danny?  Iraq is spitting now.  He's spitting into the garbage pail.  Don't waste it.  Danny.  Some fresh duck foot.  Now, Iraq has tried some.  He said the consistency is very nice.  It's been compared to a gallivari.  And try to dig into the webbing first.  Yeah, take a bite of that duck foot, son.  Big bite.  Webbing toes.  Mmm.  Oh, that does not smell very good. 
[02:46:00]  No?  Just remember, there's a pail behind you.  And that's what the duck foot is saying.  Now it's pickled duck foot.  A duck.  A duck foot.  A duck foot.  Jesus.  Is it mispronouncing?  All right.  Here he goes.  Just pop it in, man.  Sink your teeth into it.  Take a nice bite, son.  Mmm.  A heaping helping.  That's what you'll want.  I need, you know. 
[02:46:30]  I would say at first you should bite the webbing.  Bite the webbing?  No, no coffee.  You don't need coffee.  No, no, no.  Coffee will wreck it.  No, I need a little coffee.  No, no, no.  Coffee will wreck it.  Coffee will wreck it.  This is pure duck foot.  Here it is.  Mmm.  Take his call.  You don't need coffee.  You're going to spill it.  He's biting.  He's trying.  It's very tough.  Chew.  Chew that duck foot.  I'm chewing.  Oh.  That's, uh, it's pretty gross. 
[02:47:00]  Oh, he's gagging.  No, he's fine.  He's just gagging.  He's got more duck foot to eat.  He's gagging.  He's gagging.  Have some more duck foot.  He's got to finish the duck foot.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  I thought he was going to be a brave camera.  He's still gagging.  You know, the consistency is very disgusting.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  He was trying to be brave.  Yeah, it's very, uh, disgusting. 
[02:47:30]  What is that?  That is, uh, boiled tripe.  It looks like English muffins.  It looks like pieces of English muffins.  Danny's still gagging.  Well, what's going to happen with the rest of it?  How many duck feet do we get left?  Uh, yeah, one duck foot left.  Oh, well, someone else got to eat the duck foot.  Come on.  Here he goes, Dan.  Someone's got to successfully, uh, eat a duck foot.  Sam's opted out because he thinks it's gross.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Well.  The rest of us can't wait for our next catch.  Wow.  Look at this.  You're the boss, Steve.  Be a boss.  Steve's taking control.  This is... 
[02:48:00]  Sam is going to go off his eight-year-old diet.  It'll come right out.  You can't just put it in your mouth and spit it out.  I won't be able to help it.  You got to chew it.  You got to chew it.  You must chew it.  He looks really mad.  It's coming right out.  It's just going to be awful.  But what do you mean coming right out?  Like...  I can't eat rice.  It comes right out.  Rice?  What's wrong with rice?  I can't eat this stuff.  I just gag and it comes right out.  Rice and duck foot are worlds apart, my friend.  That's what I'm saying.  Well, there's a crispy fiber if you get that duck foot... 
[02:48:30]  Wow.  ...holiday weekend coming up.  Take a big bite and chew it.  Chew.  He just...  He didn't even...  He didn't hold it in his mouth for a second.  Try to hold it in your mouth.  Come on.  Chew it.  Just for like 30 seconds.  Get some molars into the action.  How about this?  You put the whole duck foot in your mouth and you chew on it for, say, 10 seconds.  The whole thing.  Just chew.  You'll have to swallow it.  Yeah, just chew for like 15, 20 seconds.  Yeah, 15 seconds. 
[02:49:00]  How about a big bite for 10 seconds?  No, the whole thing.  Just chew it.  The whole thing, chew for 15 seconds, then you can release.  The whole thing.  The whole thing.  The whole thing.  It'll stay in there for 10 seconds.  Here we go.  10 seconds.  The whole thing.  In 3, 2, 1, go.  The whole thing.  The whole thing.  Keep chewing.  That swam out of his mouth.  I saw him try to keep it down, but he physically retched.  You really are a child.  I can't do it.  All right.  There you go.  There's the boiled duck feet. 
[02:49:30]  Dan, you want a little more duck foot?  We can't waste it.  We can't waste the flavor.  There's no more duck foot.  There's no more duck foot.  Oh, no.  But there is tripe.  There's a chicken nugget.  What else are you preparing over there?  It's the boiled meat barbecue on the Opie and Anthony show.  We have some smoked tongue coming out right now.  All right.  The sheep testicles are simmering.  Okay.  And remember, no spices, no condiments.  It's just boiled.  You know, barbecues are such a huge part of the 4th of July weekend. 
[02:50:00]  Now, well, week.  It's just like a barbecue, only we were not allowed the open flame.  So we have to boil everything.  Right.  And I think it's going very well.  I agree.  The duck feet, a big hit.  So after the break, we'll eat the tripe.  And what's that again in Iraq?  This is the beef tongue.  Oh, my God.  It's just ham.  It smells like corned beef.  Let me see.  I'll bet you that's not as bad.  That's probably not bad.  It's just a piece of a cow.  That's not bad.  You'd eat that?  No.  I certainly wouldn't. 
[02:50:30]  What the hell does it look like?  Compared to a duck's foot, though, I'd eat the tongue.  Does it look like sausage or?  Looks like Canadian bacon.  Let me see.  Just tilt the plate.  Yeah, it does look.  Oh, God.  No.  There's like fibers in it.  Like, you know when you bite your tongue?  You feel it crunch a little?  It does smell.  It smells like bacon.  Smelling it.  No.  This one's not going to be that bad.  It looks kind of weird, but.  But it smells tasty.  It smells like ham.  Thick pieces of ham.  All right.  We'll give that a try next.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[02:51:00]  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  We're in the middle of our boiled meat barbecue for 4th of July.  And Baby Doll has arrived.  And Patrice O'Neill has entered the studio.  So far, we've tried the duck feet.  Duck feet didn't go over well.  A lot of people spitting it out and gagging.  E-Rock has it caught in between his teeth.  We got some food to eat here.  We got, what do we got?  What do we got?  Yeah.  What are we up to?  The tripe?  Yeah.  Which is a cow stomach.  We also have some very thinly sliced cow tongue. 
[02:51:30]  That's been, now everything's just been boiled.  It's our boiled barbecue.  Yes.  Now who's going to be brave?  Oh, Sam.  I want Sam to try everything just because it's great.  Yeah, Sam's got to try it because his reaction is so good.  He puts it in his mouth for two seconds and spits it out.  He's like a junior high school girl.  If we deep fried it, you would try it.  There was breading on it.  I know, I know.  Breading, yeah.  He's got the diet of an eight-year-old.  It tasted like a fish stick. 
[02:52:00]  Well, that's not going to, that smells kind of like ham or some kind of a bacon product.  Yeah, but just knowing what it is.  Yeah.  Well, who's trying it?  Let's get our tryers.  What are we doing?  I'll try one.  All right.  Sam's going to try some of the tongue.  I was all confident just being like, I'm going to do one of these tongues.  It's no big deal, but as you get closer.  It's just flapping.  Oh, it's a flappy tongue.  And it's a stringy consistency, it looks like. 
[02:52:30]  It's sort of a starburst.  What is that again?  The cow tongue?  It's a sliced cow tongue.  What's that, skin on the outside or some kind of fatty thing?  I think it's skin like around a Canadian bacon kind of thing.  Yeah, you keep telling yourself Canadian bacon.  Just lick it for a second.  See how it tastes.  Nah.  That's going to be an easy one.  Is it?  I should pop the whole thing in your mouth.  Go ahead.  No nibble?  No nibble?  How about a big bite?  Give it a good.  And then is...  Oh, it's a little tough.  It's a little stringy. 
[02:53:00]  I don't know what these guys are complaining about.  This is great.  Yeah, you picked the easy one, man.  Sure did.  What does it taste like?  Some kind of salami, maybe?  It really does taste like Canadian bacon.  Canadian bacon.  Yeah.  I almost missed it.  Stringy part.  Wow, he's actually popping more in his mouth.  He's enjoying it.  Stupid Danny is hungry now.  He's like, all right, I'll try it.  Take a bite.  Danny, what do you think?  Well, I know I have to because...  Because I have to.  It's easy. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah?  It's going down easy?  It's surprisingly not bad.  Yeah, that one's easy.  All right, try the...  That was an easy one.  That's almost a palate cleanser.  There you go.  From the duck feet.  I'm all set.  Yeah.  Now we've got to go to something else.  Stan's actually going to swallow him.  Stan liked it.  So that's not that bad.  See, even I think Sam could try that.  Yeah, Sam, it's not that bad.  I think you should take a bite of the...  I can't eat ham.  Look how mad he gets. 
[02:54:00]  You can.  He said he can't eat rice.  He spits out rice.  All right, just at least bite into it.  Yeah, take a bite and see what it tastes like.  See, the problem is you have this annoyance about this whole bit that now we have to  focus on.  And you've got to try new things in life.  You should have went like, ah, it's no big deal and spit it out and move on.  But you just don't want to do this on any level.  You've got to try new things in life.  Come on now.  Just take a big bite.  Just a big bite.  And chew.  And let's try to chew for 10 seconds. 
[02:54:30]  Yeah, don't just do the spit out thing.  The last one was 15 seconds, so we'll knock it down to 10 seconds.  Here we go.  Here it is.  It's probably easier to put the whole thing in your mouth than it is to rip off, gristle  and chew.  Yeah.  All right, get a bite and chew for 10 seconds.  Get a good one.  Okay.  All right, he's chewing, he's chewing.  See, it's not that bad.  You're doing a good job.  He's chewing.  That's the tunnel.  What does it taste like?  It just flew out of his mouth.  Oh, God.  What did it taste like?  Diluted Canadian bacon that was more fatty than... 
[02:55:00]  He can't even describe it.  He goes...  Get a prison sex face.  All right, what do we got next?  We got the sheep's stomach, also known as tripe.  Tripe.  This stuff is disgusting.  Yeah, the consistency of this is a little grisly.  It's...  Who's going to try this?  It's kind of like honeycomb pattern.  Well, they're all pointing around trying to get someone else to try.  With your finger there, what does it feel like? 
[02:55:30]  Just slippery...  Well, you know, this kind of...  Ew.  It's hitting the plate.  It's really heavy.  It's like a piece of thick bread with oil, soaked through with oil, it sounds like.  Yeah, that's exactly...  All those little nooks and crannies are the inside of the stomach, where all the nutrients  from the food are absorbed in.  All right, and now you're going to eat it, and your stomach's going to do the same thing  to it.  Touche.  I don't think it's going to make it that far.  Oh, Danny, what are you doing?  You look like you're gagging back there.  What's the matter?  What got you? 
[02:56:00]  Danny's tongue keeps sticking out, and he goes...  I'm trying not to focus on exactly what it is, but it's...  It's a little difficult.  It's a stomach.  It's the lining of a stomach.  It's a small piece.  Come on.  Take a bite.  Go ahead.  I'll do it with you.  That will actually absorb alcohol.  It's good.  Yeah.  I'll do it with you.  It's another stomach working for you.  Come on, Danny.  Exactly.  I'll go right after.  No, come on.  Same time.  Same time.  Same time.  Come on.  All right.  Here it goes.  Wow.  Big piece.  Nice.  The whole thing.  Whole thing.  Yeah, then chew it and swallow it. 
[02:56:30]  It ain't going to make this sick.  I'm going to probably pierce.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Dan's like...  He's got martial arts training, so there's something going on where I think he can handle this a little  better than the other guys.  He's psyching himself, you think?  Can I get back for a smaller piece?  No.  Nope.  All right.  Whole piece.  Ready?  Muzzle tov.  And go.  Open by the garbage, Danny.  What?  It was in his mouth for a second.  He wasted that piece of stomach.  He's gagging. 
[02:57:00]  No, he only had it in for a second.  He's got to get it back in.  He's got to at least chew it on a piece.  I agree.  Yeah.  I agree.  He didn't even chew it.  When the boss says chew, the subordinates chew.  You've got to chew it for 15 seconds.  Let him gag.  You've got to chew it for 15 seconds, man.  Fan's doing it.  Fan?  Fan is still chewing.  Fan, what does it taste like?  I'm keeping it to the side of my mouth.  Oh, yeah.  Like tobacco.  Yeah.  Oh, Danny's going to puke.  Yeah, well, he's got to...  Here, get another piece of tripe in your mouth for 15 seconds.  What else is over there? 
[02:57:30]  Fan is trained.  We're not going to get the reaction out of Fan.  What is that?  Sorry, Hope.  It's okay.  On this plate, we have sheep testicles.  Well, bottoms up, Dan.  No, he's got to get the tripe.  Oh, you're right.  The tripe wasn't even in his mouth for more than a second.  It was like a half a second hops.  The consistency is not pleasant.  All right.  No.  It's like eating a kitchen sponge.  Oh, God.  That's fine.  It's not bad.  All right.  Just chew it.  Come on.  Chew it for 15 seconds. 
[02:58:00]  We're on the clock here.  Let's go.  Oh, we got another piece in there?  Good.  Come on, Danny.  Let's go.  Danny's reaching for a good one.  You can do it.  Nice, big, fat, wet piece of sheep's stomach.  Just as long as you can, and then stay over the garbage just in case.  Does it taste like bad breath, like that guy said in North Carolina?  Dan just went for a little gag.  I saw that.  That's a slight gag.  Well, I've swallowed some.  All right, Danny. 
[02:58:30]  Let's go.  We got to take a break.  I don't think I'm going to be able to keep it.  Just try for 15 seconds.  As long as you can just put that in your mouth.  At least more than a second.  I barely had to chew.  Oh, wow.  That stinks.  It is so terrible.  Okay.  That's really stinking it.  I'm getting a waft of it over here.  All right.  Here we go.  Oh, God damn it.  That's a big piece.  That's a good big piece for you.  You just got to give me a second just to remember the garbage pail's right there.  That's what it's there for.  Just keep it in your mouth as long as possible. 
[02:59:00]  Just chew it.  You can do it.  All right.  Here we go.  Yeah.  Dan did it.  Dan did it.  Eat that wet shit.  Dan actually swallowed it.  All right.  Here we go.  A soggy sheep's stomach.  Yeah.  It's exactly what it is.  It's just soggy.  Three, two, one, go.  Chew.  Chew.  Chew it.  All right.  He's chewing.  He's chewing.  He's chewing.  He's not chewing.  You can do it.  Keep chewing the stomach of that animal. 
[02:59:30]  He's chewing.  The wet stomach of that animal.  He's chewing.  Oh, God.  He's squishing it between.  Oh.  Oh.  That sounds like packing bubbles.  Yeah.  What does it taste like?  Cheap stomach.  Cheap stomach.  Caramel.  Oh, a gag.  Feels fine.  Just get it right to the back of your throat.  It tastes like a used sponge. 
[03:00:00]  And it feels like one, too.  It's just awful.  It's like.  Oh.  Oh.  A little gag.  Oh.  Oh.  Jeez.  Look at him gagging.  Don't gag.  You know how hard it is to get this stuff?  He can't.  Now he's.  He can't talk or chew or anything.  He's just trapped now with it in his mouth.  You got to swallow it and make room for that sheep testicle.  Come on.  Get it.  Get it to the back of your throat where it hits the little punching bag thing in the 
[03:00:30]  back of your throat.  With that good tripe goodness.  You just swallow real quick and it'll go right down.  Dude, I'm really kind.  I know you are.  I'm really kind.  You'll get it down there, sweetie.  Those nooks and crannies are where all the feed would go in and be absorbed in by the  cow.  I thought we were friends.  You know what you do?  You chew it.  And after you chew, you go.  And you suck it in your mouth and that will drain all the fluid down your throat.  Oh, yeah.  Get the juice.  That did it. 
[03:01:00]  He hit his head.  That did it.  The juice.  On the microphone to get to the garbage pail.  The juice.  Hey, wait a minute.  By the way, I don't like the fact that Phone Boy isn't taking any tripe.  Do we have to take a break?  He could maybe pop something real quick.  Yeah.  Come on.  Travis has to have a little tripe.  I don't want Travis to be left out.  Yeah.  Why is Travis...  Here comes Travis.  Look at him.  He's a tripe.  Bring in Travis.  What do you want to try?  You can't try that beef tongue thing. 
[03:01:30]  That was too tasty.  It is.  Danny's in misery.  You want to pop one of those balls in your mouth?  Yes.  Or sure.  Pretend you're reapplying for the internship.  Yes, hello?  Or the sheep.  You're quite waif-like.  Stomach lining.  I say...  What the hell is that?  What?  What?  Sorry.  Danny had to grab the garbage pail because he's not...  I don't think he's done yet.  What is that?  That's the sheep testicles. 
[03:02:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  Get him away from me.  Patrice is not even looking at this.  Why aren't you looking, Patrice?  It's just taps into...  I'm not bothered by many things, but this mess and the sound of people eating and swallowing  just bother me.  Oh, I got, like, goosebumps.  Get that away.  It's, uh...  Do they skin the testicle?  I usually get a cast iron stomach, but this...  If I pay attention to this, it's going... 
[03:02:30]  It's oof.  It looks like...  They, like, bust apart when you cook them.  Are they, like, ballpark franks?  Have you ever seen a brain tumor?  That's what it looks like.  Oh, my God.  A brain tumor.  This thing's just poking out of it.  Hold on.  Travis, are you going to pop one in your mouth and...  No, I'll pop one of these.  I would like to see Travis eat some sheep's stomach lining, and then when we come back,  I would like to see...  Because I don't want to see those get wasted when we go on a break.  No.  I want to hear somebody enjoying the sheep testicle.  You want to try the sheep liver?  That'll be easy.  Yeah, sheep liver.  Oh, what's those?  All the ball-y things. 
[03:03:00]  Travis always looks hungry.  Those look like...  Yeah.  Eat some, Travis.  Those look like meatballs.  That looks easier than the sheep testicle.  Oh, this crap stinks.  What is...  What is the...  These are the beef tendon balls.  They're just...  That kind of smells like cat food.  That can't be that.  Like cat food.  It's made out of, I guess, beef tendons, and they just grind them up and make little Swedish  meatball-looking things out of them.  Can I ask you a question?  Why didn't you guys...  They're nasty enough to cook...  To actually cook them right.  No open clams. 
[03:03:30]  It's not allowed to open clams.  Yeah, so he had to boil them.  Yeah.  Boil them.  If we cooked them right, who cares?  Exactly.  You can make anything...  We learned a long time ago, you can make anything taste good.  We had a guy cook up rat where people went back for seconds.  Really?  Because of how he prepared it.  Rat au plov.  Yeah.  It was wonderful.  He prepared it so nicely with spices and condiments that people actually...  And he made a sauce.  People actually went back for seconds.  And enjoy rat.  Yeah, but you boil this crap, trust me, you get right down to the juice of the thing.  Travis?  Travis, what are you going to eat? 
[03:04:00]  I'll try a beef tendon ball.  All right.  All right.  Pop that whole thing in your mouth.  It looks like a meatball.  It doesn't look that bad.  The sheep testicles look like tumors.  They really do.  They bust it open.  All right.  Go ahead.  All right.  Pop it in there and chew.  Travis has got a...  What does it taste like?  That's all the gristle of an animal.  It's not bad.  It's chewy.  Oh.  Oh.  Are you gagging?  You got to swallow it.  Swallow it.  Swallow it.  Are you gagging a little?  Gagging and dry heaving is just amazing.  It really stinks. 
[03:04:30]  It smells so bad.  I'm not going to be able to swallow it.  Oh, God.  That smells so bad.  Swallow it up.  What does it taste like?  Oh.  There he goes.  Oh, he's gagging.  He's gagging.  Did you get any of that sinewy muscle tissue down your throat?  Yeah.  Oh, that stinks.  That really smells.  This is like food they used to eat.  Papillon.  I had to dump out.  There was a curse in there. 
[03:05:00]  But that smells really bad.  What did it taste like, Travis?  You know, at first, it didn't taste that bad.  It tasted like just bad meatballs.  Yeah.  But the longer you can't swallow it because of its texture, it just gets worse and worse.  Oh, God.  Is that awful?  The smell in here is horrific.  E-Rock.  Someone else is going to have a cat food ball.  Yeah, E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Eric's a good one.  You haven't eaten anything in a while.  Come on, E-Rock.  Dr. Ian recommends cat food balls.  The thing that looks like a meatball. 
[03:05:30]  It's not that bad.  We got to find someone brave enough to eat the sheep testicle that looks like a tumor.  There you go.  Just pop that nugget in your mouth.  Mmm.  It's actually not bad.  What does it smell like, E-Rock?  Just taste it.  Mmm.  Smells like a rotting meatball.  A rotting meatball.  Patrice has had his face in the same paper.  Oh, he's not even acknowledging this is happening.  He hasn't even changed the page.  No paper.  Just staring at us.  I'm breathing in my mouth and out my nose.  I'm trying very hard not to.  Take a bite of that cat food.  All right, let's go. 
[03:06:00]  Dig in.  And you got to throw the whole thing in.  Yeah.  And just bite down.  You're molding it like clay.  It's spongy.  It's spongy.  All right, go.  How many carbs is that?  Here we go.  Okay, here he goes.  It's like holding it to himself.  Pop it in your mouth.  He popped the whole thing in his mouth.  Keep chewing.  He's chewing.  He's making really bad faces.  Oh, oh, oh, wow.  How is it?  Like he's drinking sour milk.  Oh, he's gagging.  He's making a gag face.  Oh, my God.  I thought that's how white people cook their food, boiling it.  Maybe the Irish. 
[03:06:30]  The Irish do.  A lot of boiling.  This is not fair.  Boil a lot of things.  Oh, again, it just stinks out.  It sucks when you bite into those things.  It releases some kind of toxic nerve agent.  Nasty.  Yeah.  What does it taste like?  It does taste like cat food.  It's, oh.  But cat food is that just.  Cat food is almost.  You can almost deal with cat food.  What makes that worse?  I guess the consistency of it.  You're biting in it.  It feels like you're tearing flesh as you're eating it. 
[03:07:00]  That's the stringy sinew.  Trace, you want one?  What do you want to try, Trace?  Ah, the smell.  I have a crazy fire.  Oh, God.  Oh, the smell is getting.  I'm having trouble looking at it, man.  We're going to take a break.  It's our boiled meat barbecue for 4th of July.  It's our boiled meat day.  What the hell is wrong with everybody?  Hey, what's that?  And he did that with just a serious radio dude.  Hey, man.  It's boiled meat day here on Opie and Anthony.  That's right.  Dude, I can't take the smell.  Show him the gooey duck. 
[03:07:30]  Show Patrice the gooey duck before the break.  What is the gooey duck?  Oh, God.  The smell.  Oh, we're cooking the gooey duck already?  Yeah, it'll be right back.  And who is this poor prison chef over here who's doing it?  Oh, my God.  Put the top back on the boiled water.  As soon as you popped up, open the top.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, look at it.  Oh, my God.  Look at that, Patrice.  Lift it up for Patrice again.  Look at that.  What is that right there?  Look at it.  It's a giant?  It's called a gooey duck.  Look at that thing.  Now, is that a real delicacy at some point? 
[03:08:00]  It's a clam.  It's a clam with a huge appendix.  How much does that cost?  $35.  $35.  $35 for that.  I bet you that's delicious if you do something with it.  No, it's not.  Well, we're going to try it out in a little while.  It's a clam with a big, like, foot hanging out of it.  Sir, is that delicious?  Would that be a delicious meal if you was allowed to make it the way you wanted to?  He doesn't know.  Danny, where are you going?  He's never...  How?  It's not going to be made.  Danny's gagging.  All right.  What do you got, Kenny?  The whole floor stinks. 
[03:08:30]  The whole floor stinks?  Yeah.  Like, theoretically, or...  Yeah.  Well, as soon as you lift the top off the boiled water, there's some smells escaping.  Is he the realest?  Joe stinks.  Or he's just standing there looking like the guy that got killed by the light bulb in Longest  Yard.  Hey, Undertaker, make me some sheep testicles.  All right.  On the way.  Who's going to bite into the sheep testicles after the break?  Oh, my God.  I can't make this smell.  Half for Menaki.  We'll try the sheep testicles next.  And Gooey Duck on the way and Ox Penis.

[03:13:30]  Patrice O'Neill in studio.  Pat from Monaki making his way into the studio.  Can I say how badly the whole...  You cannot tell how badly this smells until you leave the room and go down the hall in the bathroom and walk back in.  It reeks in here.  Yeah, we got a couple doors that are closed in between the bathroom out there and the studio.  And as soon as you start opening doors to come back into the studio, it's just god-awful.  Is he signing a disclaimer?  It smells like rotting meat and like, I don't know, rotting seafood.  It made my wonderful, sweet honeydew and cantaloupe taste like crap. 
[03:14:00]  I'm trying to eat it, and then the last bite I took, I got a waft of that clam shell with a schlong, and it just smelled horrible.  Yeah, a lot of people are saying that someone should drink the boiled water when we're done.  Is Pat Duffy here?  Nice.  Is Pat Duffy here?  No.  Ah, man, we need Pat Duffy today.  Can I have that Lysol, please?  Nah, it's infectious.  You don't want that.  Yeah, throw it away.  Throw Lysol away. 
[03:14:30]  You want Lysol?  Don't be a douche.  You sure?  Yeah.  Thank you.  What's up, Pat?  Getting ready for the 4th of July hot dog eating contest tomorrow?  Yes, I am.  What?  Pat should just crawl around in a circle on the ground and just go, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.  Got that look to him, sure.  Hey, Pat, are you willing to try the sheep testicle that looks like kind of a brain tour?  Well, I'm keeping kind of empty for Nathan's there. 
[03:15:00]  I don't think you're going to.  I want to put up some good numbers.  I don't think you're going to be swallowing that.  Yeah.  Oh, do you mean you want me to roll it around in my mouth?  How many sheep testicles are there?  There's three left.  That's a Ralph Kramsen line.  It's kind of wavy.  Why don't you roll this around in your mouth for a while?  What you got to do.  I don't care if it boils.  What do you think?  Sure, why not?  Oh, man.  Grandma's delicious mystery appetizer.  Is that an English muffin? 
[03:15:30]  It looks like an English muffin.  That's sheep's stomach called tripe.  It looks like a raw English muffin before you cook it.  I really don't like how the Contessa here is breathing in his little Lysol napkin.  I can't.  Yeah, I know.  Contessa.  I've sprayed a napkin with Lysol, and I have it under my nose because the smell coming out of that pot is so rancid.  It's like a mixture between low tide and Chrissy's body from Jaws entangled in the seaweed. 
[03:16:00]  Yuck.  Is that a brooding accident?  It's horrid.  I am looking forward to seeing two people chew a sheep's testicle.  But Pat shouldn't be alone.  I don't think Pat should be alone.  And Pat, you can keep the gum in your mouth.  We don't care.  Imagine having a flavor of that in your gum.  Pop one of those bad boys in and start chewing and tell us what it tastes like.  Gee, I don't know where to start. 
[03:16:30]  What's this?  It's a sheep's testicle.  I thought it was a chicken leg.  No, can't you see what it was?  Chicken leg.  It does kind of look like a chicken leg.  They're all busted apart.  It looks like a tumor.  Those hot dogs are made out of the same thing.  Where's the pail?  I have to go to the weigh-in this morning.  That's all right.  A weigh-in for Nathan's.  No, he's part of the Nathan's hot dog eating process.  They take it very seriously.  That's unreasonable.  You'll be on ESPN over the weekend, right?  Yes.  What, they want to make sure you didn't lose any weight?  Yeah, I lost like 20 pounds just the last time I was here on the Extreme Fat Smash. 
[03:17:00]  Very good.  Don't worry.  This ain't going down.  I don't know.  I think you can.  It's a delicacy.  Just chew it in your mouth a little bit.  All right.  Oh.  Oh.  It's a garbage can, right?  Oh.  Oh, that's horrible.  He just had a nub off of it.  That's even worse.  Yeah.  You know, you got to take a bigger bite than that.  You just ate the nub.  I say bite right here.  I pierced the vein. 
[03:17:30]  You bit into the growth.  We want you to bite into the testicle.  Yeah.  You bit into the...  I'm afraid I'm going to squirt.  The...  Oh, here we go.  Damn.  I don't care if it squirts.  Just bite right into that sheep testicle.  There he goes.  He's a trooper.  Oh.  You hear it?  It doesn't look good, Pat.  I can see what the sheep ate. 
[03:18:00]  What does it taste like?  Sheep testicle.  That's the line of the day right there.  I think I'm full.  And you were worried that you were going to swallow that?  There's no way.  Sam, will you point you...  I'm going to swallow my tongue.  Why can't you point at Danny?  You're asking for him.  Oh, but I don't want to see...  Sam looks so annoyed.  Look at his eyes.  I know.  He's not happy.  I'm not annoyed.  Yeah, you are.  Sam doesn't want to have to try it. 
[03:18:30]  Well...  That's all right.  All right, so...  Who's going to try the other sheep testicle?  It's sticky, too.  My lips are sticking together.  Well, you know what they're full of.  Wait, don't eat all of them.  Save some.  Thank you.  For everyone.  Get the one that you spit out.  Don't eat dingy.  Dingy.  Dingy.  All right, he's picking up...  All right, who's next on the sheep testicle?  Look at me, Rocky. 
[03:19:00]  His eyes are watering, and he's not even here.  Yeah.  We might have to make you bite into one now that you're having that reaction.  What do you say, E-Rock?  Come on, E-Rock.  Just bite into it.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Dan has proven that we're not going to go to him anymore.  E-Rock, get it with the steak.  What do you think?  Can you bite into one of those?  Sure he can.  Looks like a gizzard.  You can throw the cow tongue out.  That was too easy.  Let's toss that to the side.  E-Rock looks boiled. 
[03:19:30]  Describe the sheep testicle.  It kind of looks like there's tumors on it, right?  Yeah, it looks very gristly.  Very hard and gristly, and there's nubs in it.  There's air pockets in it.  Air pockets?  Wait, I don't know if you can hear it.  He's gushing it around.  I actually like that noise.  And there's hair all over it.  Is it weird seeing that when you're not in a park or a restaurant?  Get away, get away, get away. 
[03:20:00]  Where's the hair?  Oh, my God.  There's actual hair on the thing.  It was an older sheep.  There's one or two hairs.  Well, why don't you pop the whole thing in your mouth?  Go ahead.  The whole thing.  Pop that whole thing in your mouth.  That ain't happening.  You can do it.  You can do it.  Well, you got to bite into the meat of the thing.  Come on, pelican face.  Just stick it in there.  There we go.  There we go.  Putting that pouch down there.  There he goes.  Here goes E-Rock.  No!  What?  More.  Bite right in the middle of the thing.  Here we go. 
[03:20:30]  Swallow it whole.  Come on, Vic Marl.  Swallow it whole.  Go ahead.  Chill it.  Chill it.  Chill it.  Oh, God.  Damn.  Oh, you didn't last long on that one.  What's wrong, E-Rock?  What happened, E-Rock?  What does it taste like?  I think I lost my contact lens. 
[03:21:00]  Inadvertently puts a piece of tripe in there.  You puked so hard, you lost your contact lens?  It moved.  Yeah, I got it.  What does it taste like?  Why are you using the fingers you were holding the testicle with to put your contact back in place?  Ball eyes.  Oh, shut up.  That's how you stole my line.  I was going to go out.  Those sheet ball eyes.  What does it taste like?  Can I just say this?  I know it's going to get a crash, but I bet it tastes bad. 
[03:21:30]  What does it taste like?  Yeah, what's going on?  What can you equate it to?  Like, say you haven't...  It doesn't have to be food.  Say you haven't showered in a while.  Yeah.  And you maybe happen to put your hands in a certain region.  Maybe, yeah.  Oh, my God, really?  Oh, God.  What made it worse was, at least there's portions of it that are solid meat, but when you're breaking  through, there are just those air pockets in there, and it kind of crunches. 
[03:22:00]  You know what used to be in those air pockets, right?  Yep.  Absolutely.  Oh, goodness.  Absolutely.  All that deliciousness.  Is that a real...  Is that just some fear factor thing, or it's for people eating this stuff?  Huh?  People eat...  Yeah, we got this from an Asian supermarket downtown.  Oh, those people.  How about...  We have one more.  Yep.  All right, one more testicle.  Who's up?  Oh, God. 
[03:22:30]  I don't know how to do it.  Sam is just arguing in the background, ain't happening, ain't happening.  Whatever.  Let's get...  Ain't happening.  This ain't happening, man.  This ain't happening.  I want to be racist so bad right now.  Yeah, right?  I'm just going to smack myself in the face.  Just shut up.  Yeah, I'm done.  What do you say?  It's got to be Danny, because I think Sam is easy to gross out.  Yeah.  All right, who's stepping up to the plate?  Wow, is Danny coming back?  Danny's a bit dumb.  Danny's coming back.  He was indulging last night, so he's not...  Danny had a real rough night.  Yeah, he's looking terrible. 
[03:23:00]  So he is not going to be able to deal with these things very easily.  Danny, you know, he got raped in a bowling alley.  Yeah.  He's got his...  What was it?  The big ragu.  He's got his shirt on.  You know I go from rags, and that's it.  All right, Danny.  Come on, dry hands.  I'm mentally preparing.  You're trying to psych yourself up? 
[03:23:30]  Just eat it.  It looks like a baby, like a raw baby heart.  How do you know what that looks like?  It's what I eat.  Exactly.  It looks like you stole lunch from us.  Go ahead, Danny.  You're a soldier, man.  Yeah.  Stem cell research center.  Just pop it in your mouth.  You don't even have to chew it.  Just pop the whole thing in your mouth, and just hold it there like it's a mushroom.  All right, here we go.  The last sheep testicle has been picked up off the plate.  Do your thing, baby.  I'm down with you, Danny.  Go ahead, man.  Oh, boy.  Come on, buddy.  You chew that for a couple seconds, Dan.  Look at that. 
[03:24:00]  There's a crispy buck for you.  Wow.  Buck.  There really is like some kind of hair on it.  You can't just look.  Get it away from me.  Get it away from me.  Get it away from me.  I can't even look.  He smelled it and just gagged.  This smells so bad.  I don't think, I really don't think I can even keep it in my mouth for a second.  You smell worse, man.  Try your hardest to keep that in your mouth. 
[03:24:30]  I was going to say, you stole another one on my mind.  Hey, what else are we boiling over here?  Just a quick on and draw.  Let's talk to the cook that doesn't want to plug today.  Oh, you lifted the tin again.  Oh, man.  Every time you lift that lid.  The clam is going to be ready.  Why is it green?  Why is it turned green?  He knows.  He's never boiled this crap before.  I've never cooked it before.  Holy mackerel.  Do you see that?  It's green.  It wasn't wearing any protection.  The gooey duck has turned green. 
[03:25:00]  And what's that?  I believe this is the oxtail.  Penis.  Penis.  The ox penis.  There's a tail of the penis.  Ox penis.  Yeah, it can't be the oxtail.  The oxtail penis.  Yeah, the ox penis.  And then we have...  Oh, oxes ain't packing like that.  All right, he's going into his other pond.  Huh?  Then we have...  Hold on.  That's just the helmet.  Hold on, hold on.  That's the helmet?  We have the pig head in here.  You're boiling the pig head?  The entire pig head is in there.  Oh, my God.  Nice.  All right, let's go, Danny.  Here you go, son.  Do it for the radio show. 
[03:25:30]  Do it for Philly.  Here it is.  All right.  I don't think I'm going to be able to actually bite into it.  You can do it, Danny.  You got to bite it.  You got to bite it.  I will attempt it.  It'll be all right.  You can do it, buddy.  You got to.  Oh, it is so bad.  Just hold on.  I thought the tripe was bad.  This smells so much worse than the tripe.  Do your thing.  Maybe just straighten your hair up.  Hold on his nose.  Whatever it takes.  He's holding his nose.  If it works...  Pop the whole thing in your mouth.  Hold your nose for a second.  All right, it's in.  Now bite it.  Bite down.  Bite right in the middle of the testicle.  Come on.  Don't waste it. 
[03:26:00]  He's gagging.  Danny.  He's gagging.  He barely punctured it.  That was a jip.  I bet your dad a knife or fork would be...  You could figure out how to eat it.  Just cut it.  Go out of slowly.  No one puts any whole thing in their mouth at all.  You don't even put a real...  A well-cooked whole meatball in your mouth at once.  What happened, Danny?  That's a good point.  It has the consistency of... 
[03:26:30]  I can't even describe...  It's just terrible.  It's awful.  It's like biting into a piece of styrofoam almost.  It's just...  You want to wash down some tripe?  I'd rather have the tripe, to be honest with you.  Wow.  So far, the sheep testicle is the worst thing.  Yeah, that's the worst thing so far.  Why?  Because it's got some crunchy thing happening first, and then...  I don't know.  No, the smell is so bad.  It's indescribable.  It's absolutely indescribable.  It's just...  Maybe the sheep just cut the grass. 
[03:27:00]  Oh, the gooey duck is being presented.  Vinny in Hicksville, what's up?  Oh, it's green.  Vinny!  Yeah, hi.  What's up?  How you doing?  Yeah, we're just going to let you guys know.  There was an episode one time of Dirty Jobs.  Yeah.  Where Mike Rowe actually went out and dug up those gooey ducks.  Yeah.  And then they brought it back to the store, and I believe they did what you guys did.  They boiled them, and he said it tastes delicious.  Oh, really?  Well, we're going to find out.  Yeah, well, good luck.  Have fun.  It looks kind of like a clam, and then this huge kibasa. 
[03:27:30]  Danny's dry heaving.  It's sticking out of the clam.  Danny's dry heaving.  What are those clams called that have that little thing sticking out?  Clams?  The piss clams.  Yeah, that's it.  Yeah.  Sounds like a lot of fun, guys.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Enjoy the day.  All right.  The cook is attempting to cut into the gooey duck.  The gooey duck looks like something that fell off a zombie.  I died.  It's green.  It's green and lumpy.  Look at him over there, lay carving it. 
[03:28:00]  Just pull it apart with your fingers.  Why are there holes through it?  Probably so I can breathe.  Well, because that's where someone was telling, someone on Instant Feedback was saying that  that's where the baby batter, they shoot baby batter.  What is that?  The gooey duck, what is it really?  It's a clam?  I guess it's in the clam family because there's a clamshell around it, but this thing is massive  that pops out of it.  Most clams have some kind of a thing that comes out that they use to feed with.  What's the one in the Bahamas that they eat? 
[03:28:30]  A conch.  A conch.  Is that what that is?  A conch.  That's not a clam, though.  No.  Is that what that is?  No.  The conch.  They're both from the mollusk family, yet that one has a very, very big...  Look at him presenting it.  He can't help but be a chef.  Damn it.  Never mind.  Just throw it on the plate.  Yeah, it's a very big...  There we go.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  We'll try the gooey duck next.  Oh, God.  Also, the oxtail penis next.  It stinks so bad in here. 
[03:29:00]  What else haven't we tried?  Is there a gooey pearl in it?  Travis, what haven't we tried?  Pig head.  Travis bought all this stuff.  Oh, the pig head.  That's right.  That's the biggest ox penis I could find.  We still have to try.  No, no.  We're going to do that after the break.  What haven't we boiled yet?  Oh.  For our boiled meat barbecue.  Out of the stuff that I bought, I don't think we've done the sea cucumbers yet.  Oh, yeah.  Those are really disgusting.  Do you boil those?  I have no idea.  Does anyone know?  All right.  And who eats the sea cucumbers? 
[03:29:30]  What group?  Sea cucumbers.  Asians.  I got all of it at an Asian supermarket.  Did you really?  Yeah.  People actually do eat this.  This is a supermarket food.  Now, did they say these words or it was just the squiggly lines?  You would think these animals...  No, they've got it in English, too.  Yeah?  I mean, people were buying it just like I was.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You would think these animals would be safe.  Yeah.  Right.  You know, that's a good-ass point.  No one's going to want to eat me.  You're like, oh, man, I don't see you.  When it's just a live gooey duck just chilling like... 
[03:30:00]  Yeah.  A gooey duck's hanging out of this lobster.  I don't have a natural enemy.  I'm a gooey duck.  His lobster's all around him.  He's like...  He's laughing at him.  No one's going to eat this.  Dumb-dumb, you're about to get boiled.  I'm just a gooey duck, baby.  Who eating me?  Yeah.  There it is.  Somebody will try the gooey duck next.  It's the Boiled Meat Barbecue on O.P. and Anthony's.  The O.P. and Anthony's Show.  Right here.  On Sirius XM.  Certainly is.  You're checking out the O.P. and Anthony's Show.  You all right, buddy? 
[03:30:30]  And what a disgusting show it is.  Kind of a strange warning.  We got Patrice O'Neill in studio.  Hello.  It's our Boiled Meat Barbecue.  We got the gooey duck.  It's cooked.  Yes, sir.  I think Jared should go next.  Who?  Jared.  Jared?  Our new star.  All right.  Yeah, Jared.  That's going to be nothing.  Mr. Dookie Hands.  You should make him eat two things together.  Oh, God.  I was trying to think, how could this be more disgusting?  Imagine, like, the testicles. 
[03:31:00]  The testicles, the duck, and the tripe.  And then the penis.  Just make him.  Because this dude, if he's willing to grab boo-boo, then he can eat two things.  Yeah.  Jared, what do you want to try?  What's that?  It's good, Capote.  Eat a bite.  He really does have a.  His face has a lot of character.  Look at his face.  Oh, God.  Is that the gooey duck? 
[03:31:30]  Gooey duck.  That might not be bad, actually.  It's a delicacy.  It's an Asian delicacy.  So it might not be bad.  I don't like seafood.  Oh, don't be a goose.  That is the furthest thing from seafood.  Uh-oh.  Don't worry about it.  You didn't say I like seafood?  You picked up somebody's seqo matter?  You piece of garbage?  This is your line?  I don't like seafood.  All right.  He's picking up a piece of the gooey duck.  Gooey duck.  Why are you putting it in your mouth, John Voight from Midnight Cowboy?  He pulled the skin off it.  It's kind of denting. 
[03:32:00]  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Oh, God.  I can't even look at him touching that.  Hold on.  Hold on.  You can't pull the skin off the thing.  Yeah.  The skin is the best part.  What's wrong with you?  That's what all the nutrients are.  What are you trying to be healthy?  Put it in your mouth.  All right.  Here he goes.  John Voight.  And there goes Jared chewing the gooey duck.  Tastes like chicken.  There you go.  No, it doesn't.  Come on.  It doesn't.  Come on.  Oh, no.  There he goes.  Hold on.  Hold on.  He's gagging.  Come on.  Chew that.  Chew that.  Chew it up. 
[03:32:30]  Someone mic him.  Get it in the back of your throat so it really binds up.  What's wrong?  Yeah.  What's the problem?  What's the problem?  What's up?  What's wrong?  What seems to be the problem?  You're gagging.  Get it in the back of your throat.  A big lump of it.  Get that big hunking lump of gooey duck hanging out in the back.  Did you see the two nostril holes in it?  Yeah.  That's what you were eating, by the way.  It's part of the sinus.  That's where the mucus membrane is. 
[03:33:00]  Get it in the back of your throat.  Come on, Jared.  What's going on?  Come on.  Why don't you get tired of a little sub?  You've got to eat every day.  Get it down.  He's trying to swallow it?  Swallow that thing.  You swallowed it?  You swallowed it?  What a trooper.  Wow, did he have a hard time.  Wow, did he have a rough time with that.  You said it tasted like chicken.  Yeah.  Until what?  What happened?  Rancid chicken.  Roadkill.  I think it was you guys just describing what it really was.  Yeah, we were trying.  Did he have a piece of that? 
[03:33:30]  That stuff looked good.  No, not the tripe.  The other stuff.  Oh, the meatball looking thing?  The meatballs weren't bad, from what everybody said.  Oh, the ligament.  Yeah, you ought to try a bite of that, Jared.  Yeah, Jared, try the meatball.  Try the ligament meatball.  Come on, almost albino.  Let's say hi to Chuck in Jersey.  Chuck, what's up?  All right, a little bit of information I called before I left out about the gooey duck.  Mike Rowe on 30 jobs, he did eat it.  However, he did remove the skin first, and they only boiled it for six seconds.  Well, we're over-boiling stuff, because we want to be safe here. 
[03:34:00]  We have no idea how long you're supposed to boil this crap.  Oh, they probably caught it fresh on that show, anyway.  Oh, I'm sure.  Yeah, ours has been sitting in a supermarket waiting for a brave soul to buy it.  Oh, jeez.  You probably get some other letter coli.  Yeah.  L-coli.  Some other letter coli.  Oh, you've got the M-coli.  We don't even have a cure for that.  Way worse than that. 
[03:34:30]  You got Q-coli.  All right, so you're going to try one of those-  You're going to try one of those ligament meatballs.  Come on, duty fingers.  Just eat the seafood.  Yeah.  Come on.  I don't like seafood.  Here he goes.  That's a beef product.  I think the whole thing.  Huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  As soon as you can.  I mean, don't go crazy.  Come on.  Don't be a goose.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Save room for dessert.  There you go.  No, pop the whole thing in your mouth.  That's right.  Yeah.  You're chewing it.  Now, that is ligaments.  It's cow's ligaments. 
[03:35:00]  They've been mashed up and made into meatballs.  Yeah.  Those were-  And then boiled.  What connects the muscles.  Yeah.  That gristle that you hit when you eat steak sometimes, and it really stinks.  Is it going through your nose and smelling real bad?  No?  He's eating worse.  It's the connective tissue, actually, inside of an animal's body.  Oh, oh.  He's gagging a little, trying to swallow it.  This kid's a trooper.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I think-  A trooper.  A testicle.  You downgraded him after what he did the other day.  He's been upgraded.  I say a testicle, and he's done. 
[03:35:30]  Yeah.  How are you doing?  Good?  All right.  Old duty fingers is-  He's just swallowing everything.  You're wrecking our bit.  He's loving this stuff.  He's just a complete mess.  You're wrecking our boiled meat barbecue.  I told you a guy like that who would do that.  He needs to eat two things.  All right.  We go to the tripe.  We go to the tripe, Jeremy.  Oh, come on.  No fish.  Don't get diggated.  That's not fish.  That's not fish.  That's sheep.  It's sheep.  It's in the sheep family, not the fish family.  Go ahead.  He's allergic to fish.  Come on.  No fish.  He touched it. 
[03:36:00]  No fish.  That's hysterical.  What's wrong with the touch of that thing?  I don't like it.  I got a bad feeling about this.  It's not fish.  No, it's all right.  It's not fish.  Don't worry.  We promise it's not fish.  No seafood, but I'll juggle.  Don't.  Are you gagging, touching it?  Yeah.  Why?  I don't like that.  What does it taste like?  He's holding it.  What does it taste like?  I mean, what does it feel like?  It feels like a-  I believe it's a pizza snack without sauce.  We should have ketchup.  Put ketchup on everything.  No.  What a sweet boy.  That's good.  Just slap in your mouth and chew and hold on to it. 
[03:36:30]  You can do it.  Come on.  You wear a dung hat, but you won't eat tripe.  Yeah.  You do these.  All right.  Throw it in there.  Let's go.  Stop.  There it is.  That is the lining of a stomach of a sheep.  Yeah.  You're eating sheep lining.  Keep it in.  Keep it in.  Suck guys swallowing everything.  All those little nooks and crannies are where it digests its food.  Where the blood coagulates.  Yeah.  And if you saw that unwashed, there's blood clots in there. 
[03:37:00]  He ate it.  Big boy ate it.  Wow.  You are good.  What did that taste like?  I have no idea.  He definitely is chewing his way to the top.  He's going to make it.  All right.  What else could he try?  Get some liver, but I don't think it's going to be a problem.  I think no testes left?  Do we have any uncooked?  I wouldn't eat uncooked.  No.  All right.  Oh.  Put it back in the boiling water.  Could you cook some more testicles, sir?  Appreciate that.  All right.  Yeah.  Another order of testicles here, please.  Yes.  We have two more. 
[03:37:30]  Just sitting in the stomach, too.  Just throw them at me.  All right.  We'll try the liver just because nobody's had it yet.  All right.  What kind of liver is this?  Beef.  Well, what about the oxtail penis?  Is that almost done?  Almost.  All right.  Almost.  How can you tell?  I want somebody else to try this stuff, too.  He can't have this kid eating everything.  He's loving it.  Yeah.  This is a snack for him.  Well, I hear the gooey duck isn't that bad.  It just looks disgusting, and it's green and all that.  He was gagging, though.  Look, again, he's gagging just touching the liver.  By the way, Brian, the intern, will drink the water.  The smell coming out of these pans is just... 
[03:38:00]  I will bet money that you're throwing these pans out after today.  You're not going to get the smell out of these things anytime soon.  E-Rock, you want some gooey duck?  I think E-Rock.  I feel bad.  E-Rock.  Eric feels left out.  Yeah.  E-Rock, what's wrong?  You want to try one?  Dumpy boy number two is getting more attention.  I don't like it.  Have a little bit of...  It looks like pig nostrils when you slice it thin like that.  Yeah, there's two holes.  Looks like a pig's snout.  All right, bite into one there, E-Rock.  Eric's face is just built for swallowing something whole. 
[03:38:30]  I want to see him just swallowing like a snake and just watch his whole body get shaped like  the food he's eating.  Come on, pretend it's a live rabbit.  You going for the gooey duck?  Come on, primeval.  Here he goes.  Our own E-Rock.  It's built for swallowing.  Going for the gooey duck.  What's this smell like?  It smells like low tide.  You're used to that smell.  You went out of the bird at the beach. 
[03:39:00]  Come on.  But Jared ate the whole thing.  Come on, man.  He swallowed that.  He swallowed the tripe.  He swallowed all the stuff you guys puked up.  Except with that.  Come on.  Eat pelican.  All right, go ahead.  Bite into that.  Come on, seagull cheeks.  There he goes.  Flop that in, Mike.  Come on.  Nice gooey duck. 
[03:39:30]  What's the matter?  It's stuck?  It was stuck in his mouth.  It was stuck in his mouth.  Oh, my God.  Stuck in between his teeth.  Oh, God.  Stuck in his mouth.  What'd it taste like?  Jared swallowed that thing, that freak.  What'd it taste like, E-Rock?  Like, is it bad?  Yeah.  What does it taste like?  It tastes like you just took a fish out of the ocean and just bit right into it. 
[03:40:00]  So it has kind of a low tide, fishy seaweed.  It smells like  It smells like fish that you would leave in the sun for a while  It's bait pretty much  It's bait  People eat this  I don't think they cook it this way  They probably spice it up a little  And what good could it be  Unless you could boil something and eat it  I don't care what you put on it  I bet you something of 
[03:40:30]  Sex for sexual something  Yeah let's go to Jackie on Long Island  Jackie  Hey guys  This is gross  I had to pull over on the LIE  I was heaving  You don't really sound believable  Yeah her voice sounds like something you boil  Oh guys  It was disgusting  I'm walking into work  She sounds like she eats cigarettes  Sounds like a set up call  We set this up  Like hey guys

Anthony Show  It's the worst of the O.P. Anthony Show  On the Virus 
[04:05:00]  Sirius XM  Well, see  I was a very innocent boy growing up  Extremely innocent  Yeah  Grew up with a very strict mom  So I didn't get to really explore  Just kind of had to keep it close to the vest  Not a lot of knowledge as far as  No, I just played my basketball every day  And there was a whole world going on  You know, past my driveway 
[04:05:30]  But, you know, to ask permission to get past my driveway  Was basically a nightmare  Yeah  So I matured a little later than most  And when I found out about the whole sex thing  In Washington Drive School  In 5th or 6th grade  I was horrified  And I ran home  And I ran up into an apple tree  And I stayed there all afternoon long  Climbed an apple tree  How all American and perfect  I know, that really is 
[04:06:00]  Norman Rockwell painting  Well, what horrified me  I know we've told the story a bunch on the air  But it's worth bringing up again today  You know, you're just a little kid  Playing soccer  And wiffle ball  And basketball  And doing your little art projects  And not much heavy lifting going on  Especially in grammar school  It's pretty easy, right?  Yeah  And then you go to school one day  And your whole freaking life and world changes  All of a sudden they're like  Oh, we're going to do something a little different today  And all of a sudden  They separate the boys and the girls 
[04:06:30]  I'm saying something that a million people understand  And then you march into the gym  In single file  You know, guys on the right  Women, girls on the left  There's a door in between you  The big accordion door is shut  And they show you the film  We need the music  The film  The film  Daner  Yes, you know what that film is  Well, actually  A lot of people don't  Until  Until they start it rolling  They're like  Oh, what is this?  We're going to watch cartoons  Well, you're suspicious though 
[04:07:00]  Because you're like  Alright, why  Is it just guys  And why are the girls  On the other side of the door?  Alright, so far we know  We're seeing a film  What could possibly  What could this film possibly be?  Yeah  That the girls aren't allowed to watch it  Oh, well  Let me watch it  Oh, no  This is  This is the movie  Oh, no  I heard about this  From the older kids  And then these cool bastards 
[04:07:30]  They tell you about stuff  That you're not even going to be allowed to do  For another six years in general  Yeah  Unless you're a lucky little fella  You're going to have to remember all this info  For when it actually comes about  Yeah, you're like 11 or 12  And they're telling you about this new world out there  But you can't touch this new world  For another five or six years  If you're a good Catholic  And they're always the kids  With the creepy families  Who are pointing out  What's wrong with the movie  No, this is crap right here  What you're saying  I'll tell you how to deal with this situation 
[04:08:00]  Well, those were the hippie families  That, you know  Walked around their houses nude and stuff  Oh, I've seen this crap already  You'll start to notice hair  Growing on certain parts of your body  And girls  You'll notice  You'll start growing  Breasts  And they show some little fella  Trying to shave for the first time  Yeah, this is where hygiene  Becomes very important  Explaining what whiskers really are  You're going to have to wash every day  Your body is changing  Wash your arms  Yeah, under your arms 
[04:08:30]  Your body is changing  You'll notice hair growing  On places that didn't have hair before  Yeah  Oh, no  It's  Oh, it is  This is embarrassing  And if I'm not mistaken  Back in the day  Because we're a little older  We got to see a little nudity  With our film  Yeah, it was like cartoon nudity  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah  I didn't see any real nudity  We used to have to  Cartoon nudity was the bomb  Invade the library  To try to find, like, real nudity  Yeah  Yeah  Sometimes they'd have those  Nowadays, I guess they really  Kind of weed that out  But books in my library 
[04:09:00]  And, like, even elementary school  If you were clever enough  And kind of took enough time  To really look  You could find naked girls in there  I used to find naked stuff in dictionaries  Biology books  Dictionaries  Dictionaries?  Yeah, little sketches  The little sketch?  Oh, yeah  I forgot  Would you look up, like, V  A  No, just like  You wouldn't?  Well, I'm sure  And then there'd be, like, a picture of it?  No, I'm sure I did  I'm trying to remember  What would get you  To the naked sketches  In the dictionary  Maybe something about  Pregnancy or something 
[04:09:30]  So then you have a sketch  Of a pregnant woman  Yeah  Encyclopedias are good also  Yeah  Yeah, because they used to have  The entire encyclopedia set  In the library  And you'd just  Break out one of those  Make like you're  Studying something  You know  Make like you're studying  I don't know  Virginia  Yeah  And then you'd  Pull out the old V  Change a letter or two  Yeah  Call me at  Where's the C volume  In the encyclopedia? 
[04:10:00]  So then they  The grammar  What birthday  Is this?  Grammar school  Grammar school  It's like you're  The little rascals  Well, people usually  Say grade school  Or just  Grammar school  I would say  Grammar school  I never called it  Grammar school  I think we used to say  Grammar school  I called it  Elementary school  Elementary school  It was elementary school  For me  Yeah  And then, you know  Middle school  Junior high  High school  Whatever you call it  Anyway  That's the  I picture the single 
[04:10:30]  Schoolhouse  The little house  On the prairie  Kids  Right  So  So then the film  Is over  And then the  Then the gym teacher  Or whoever the hell  Showed us the damn film  In grade school  Said  Well  We instructed your parents  You know  To ask you about the film  And to help you along  And help answer  Some of the questions  You might have  After seeing this film  Yeah  And that's when I  And then they gave us  The rest of the day off  Because it was  This was heavy lifting  For an 11 or 12 year old 
[04:11:00]  You can't  Wrap your mind around it  You can't go  You know  To gym class  After that  And throw the huge  Ball around  No  Or climb the ropes  Or anything  And this was  This was  This was a serious day  So it was a half day  For everybody  And I ran home  Because my house  Was close to  Washington Drive School  Out there in Centerport  And I proceeded  Because I knew  My parents knew  That I saw the film  That I had to run up  Into the apple tree  And I stayed there  For the rest of the afternoon  And my dad was at  The bottom of the tree  I'll never forget it  Trying to coerce me down 
[04:11:30]  Saying it's not  Going to be that bad  We'll keep it quick  Because I guess  They were supposed  To talk to you  Every single  And I'm like  Man I don't want  To deal with this  I just want to  Play my basketball  I'm not ready  For this man  I had a similar experience  Because I went home  And asked my dad  I said  Dad I have a question  And he goes  Yeah your mom is a  I was like  Oh no  That's not what I  Why  Yeah your son  Just came in here  And he's asking me  Questions  Why don't you  Shut up

[04:14:30]  To have God  Ow  Dad  You're a little wordy  Dad  Yeah  This is quite a wordy beating  Ow  You used to be  Angelic  Angelic  Angelic  Now you're just up  Get  Can you give me the  Cliff notes beating dad  Yeah  Yeah please  Could you edit this down  I'm really hurting  Give me an editor  My hiney's hurting  From your belt  It's not a puppet 
[04:15:00]  Row  It's a doll  Oh that one  I had to deal with  What  Oh  I was making a puppet  When I was a kid  I wanted to make a puppet  A marionette  Type puppet  So I took like some paper towels  And masking tape  And I made a puppet  But I hadn't had the string  And the wood  To make it a marionette yet  Right  I was a kid  Anthony  A little something about Anthony 
[04:15:30]  He's obviously highly intelligent  Thank you  And he never graduated high school  Because  Probably because of his family life  And he  Had to smoke a lot of pot  Over the years  He would tell me about his science experiments  He used to do as a kid  And how he would take things apart  To see how they work  Like he was very very  Alone  Alone  You were very adventurous though  Yeah yeah  I would build things  And take things apart  And chemistry sets  You probably could have been  Something really really big  Yeah I could have been  Instead I'm here  Yeah 
[04:16:00]  You should have been the little girl  From the sixth sense  Later on the puppet show  So you were making a puppet  I was making a marionette puppet  And I didn't have the string  But I kind of made it  And I was kind of proud of it  And it was fun to like play with  And I wanted to take it  Because we were all going to the store  So I took it with me into the car  We all hopped in the car  And I took it out of the car  Once we got to the supermarket  And my father goes  What are you doing with that?  I go  It's a puppet  I'm taking it inside  He goes  It's not a puppet 
[04:16:30]  It's a doll  You leave it in the car  I'm not going to have my son  Play with a doll  And then told your mom  It was a doll  And my mother's just like  Joey  It's a puppet  Ro  It's a f***ing doll  You want him to be a f***ing kid  It's a doll Ro  And I'm like  It's a puppet  I just need the string  Yeah you need a string  A f***ing string  Do I have to beep that?

[04:17:30]  And then we'll have  Always  And then you'll have a drink together  My father yelled at me so bad  When the car overheated  And flushing once  It was pouring rain  The car overheated  It stalled  And I was crying my eyes out  And he's aggravated  Because it's pouring rain  He's under the hood  And I'm just  And he's like  Would you  Shut him up  He's just upset Joey  What upset  He's a f***ing fruit  He should have used your tears  To throw into the 
[04:18:00]  Yeah  Yeah let me hold him over  The radiator  And just squeeze the tears  Out of him  At least we can use these tears  For something useful  Oh  I got a cramp  In my leg once  And it was so bad  And I was a kid  And I just screamed  Bloody murder  It was the first time  It ever happened  And it felt like  I was stabbed in my leg  And I screamed  I was like  And he goes  What's the matter with you  I got a pain in my leg  He goes  It's a cramp  He goes  If you ever make 
[04:18:30]  A f***ing sound like that again  You better have an arrow in you  What a baby  No no no  Just a baby  I'm waving off that pitch  That is really funny  No my father didn't rip the puppet up  But I think I  I did take it inside with me  And my mom's like laughing  At my father  Like it was  For me it was just a matter of  Oh I get to take my puppet with me  But between my parents  It was my mother going 
[04:19:00]  I won this one ass  I won this one Joey  And I  I know your mom pretty well  She's an awesome lady  I'm sure  She's changed like  Light years from back then too  I'm sure behind closed doors  She like kind of gave you  Your puppet bag  And said it's okay Anthony  It's okay  It's a puppet  Here's your puppet  You do whatever you want  It's a doll Rosemary  Doll it's a puppet  I should have just turned gay  Just to really screw him up  Right  You should have turned  I guess he didn't have 
[04:19:30]  An open mind  As far as that stuff goes  Nah not really  My father was so old school  It was just ridiculous  Talk about lack of tolerance  Jesus Christ  I heard words  That by God I still use  I mean  I heard  No it's growing up in that house  You heard words  That they haven't even invented yet  For things  Believe me  Alright we go  Win it win it boo  That's it for the worst  Of Opie Anthony  Well gentlemen  Another show  Well done
