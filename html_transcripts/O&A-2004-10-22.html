<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast, airing on XM Satellite Radio, began with the hosts' return after a two-year absence following a controversial sex stunt at St. Patrick's Cathedral.  The show immediately launched into explicit language and crude humor, a recurring theme throughout the entire broadcast.  Initial topics included the St. Louis Cardinals' World Series victory, contrasting the celebratory atmosphere in St. Louis with the violent riots in Boston following the Astros' loss, including the death of a bystander. Opie and Anthony shared personal anecdotes about their rebellious youth, involving various acts of vandalism and underage drinking and driving, followed by numerous listener calls detailing similar misadventures and run-ins with the law.  One caller recounted a particularly depressing experience regarding a romantic rival.  Comedian Jimmy Norton was present in the studio throughout much of this initial segment, and the hosts also discussed NYConfidential.com, a website offering paid sex services, with one host expressing reluctance due to parental concerns.

The broadcast continued with a caller, Mike from Buffalo, describing his unsuccessful attempts to win over a cocaine-addicted woman, even waiting for her in the ICU. This led to a discussion about different types of women, dating woes, and listener commentary mocking Mike's "nice guy" approach.  Further calls included Tony from Cincinnati offering unsolicited relationship advice, and Jennifer seeking advice on seducing an older man. The show also incorporated prank calls to a bar, discussions of a dentist accused of groping patients, and a caller offering to have sex with his wife on air. Jaime was present in the studio during this portion. Political discussions regarding the upcoming election and political photo ops were interspersed with the sexually explicit and often crude conversations.  A caller attempted to play the "What's in Your Pants?" game, contributing to the overall sexually charged atmosphere.

A caller named Melanie from Ohio, naked on her back deck, discussed the election, initially supporting Kerry before realizing his plans to send more troops. The conversation quickly devolved into discussions about her sex life and a game of "Guess What's in My Pants," with Melanie using her phone to create sounds indicative of her pubic hair style. The correct guess was "Hitler Mustache" with a five o'clock shadow.  Subsequent calls included Chuck from Arkansas boasting about sex with an older woman, John from an unspecified location making violent threats towards his wife during a political debate, and Super Chicken discussing his stepsister's husband leaving her for another man. Bill the trucker provided a joke, and further discussion revolved around the ambiguities of the "Guess What's in My Pants?" game.  A comedic audio montage remixed a Bush speech with John Lennon and Lou Reed lyrics was played. This segment also featured Jim Norton’s in-studio stink bomb incident, causing a staff member to flee, followed by further calls and discussions regarding Tony Danza's talk show, and a Chicago radio host, Kyle, who criticized Opie and Anthony while simultaneously attempting to hire their staff. The segment ended with Opie and Anthony mocking Kyle and Howard Stern.

The show progressed with crude jokes targeting Howard Stern's daughter, followed by a discussion about the New York Yankees' collapse, debated against the infamous Bill Buckner incident.  This was followed by a reading of a humorous “Top Ten Things the Boss Will Do in the Offseason” list from Steve Serby of the New York Post, featuring offensive jokes. Serby's Comedy Cellar appearance was promoted.  Listener calls continued the pattern of sexually explicit conversations and the “What's in my pants” game. The “Hot Teen News” segment covered an FBI sting operation targeting online solicitation of a minor, raising ethical questions. The segment concluded with a Radio Shack employee, Raquel, agreeing to masturbate on air while describing her workplace, followed by further sexually charged conversations and a cocaine use anecdote.

The final segment began with the hosts incorrectly identifying their broadcast week, then transitioning to a discussion of an Eminem music video parodying Michael Jackson that BET had pulled, prompting a debate on race and hypocrisy in media censorship. Erica Strada's appearance on VH1 was also mentioned.  A segment followed where listeners shared what they learned that day, the responses ranging from humorous to crude and offensive, with repeated references to Radio Shack.  A caller claimed President Bush performed an abortion, and other calls focused on sexual frustration and the attractiveness of women.  Further discussion covered Bill O'Reilly and sexual harassment allegations. The show concluded with a prank call involving a false European vacation win and a preview of next week's show, featuring a "lesbian for a day" segment and a Steve-O guest appearance, ending with a frustrated customer service call.

[00:02:30]  The Opie and Anthony show 
[00:03:00]  The Opie and Anthony show 
[00:03:30]  The Opie and Anthony show 
[00:04:00]  The Opie and Anthony were pulled from the airwaves two years ago  After a sex stunt at St. Patrick's Cathedral 
[00:04:30]  Opie and Anthony are back, so why won't the SEC be able to touch them this time?  The duo has signed with XM Satellite Radio  Their contract with Infinity expired back in May, but the no-compete portion is up until October  No arrests have been made, no arrests have been made, police are still investigating  The Opie and Anthony are back, so why won't the Opie and Anthony show  Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it, let's do it  The blonde one, uh, seems so-called radio shock  Our society needs borders  It needs parameters  You dick 
[00:05:00]  They get their dollies by saying, let's keep pushing the envelope  They were doing what they were paid to do  Even when there are bucks to be made  There's a price to be paid in terms of the cultural degradation that we do not want to be associated with anymore  Are you adequately prepared to rock, rock, rock  The Opie and Anthony show  Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, and tits  You beast  You savage  Come on, bark like a dog for me 
[00:05:30]  Bark like a dog  I will teach you the meaning of the word respect  The last time I saw a mouth like that, I had a hook in it  You like Huey Lewis and the News?  I love the smell of napalm in the morning  Ah, yeah  Smells like  Victory 
[00:06:00]  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony show  Show 15  Well, we're counting  On XM Satellite Radio  Counting down  Ah, we count for a while and then we just give up on that  Then we forget  Then we forget  Then we count how many days till we're back on the air eventually  Oh God  And that will happen again  We say that going into every job  Eventually  Anthony and I will not be here 
[00:06:30]  But  I don't think we'll be looking for another gig after this one  So enjoy the time you have with your pals ONA  That's right  And a little Jimmy Norton  Yeah, we have said that in many interviews  When we blow it up this time  It's over, Johnny  It's over  That's right  Until we come back for the reunion show  Oh  That will never happen  No reunion show  Checking out the TV, Anthony  It's over, Johnny  Oh, yes it is  It's over  Nothing is over 
[00:07:00]  Wow, that was really loud in my headphones  Checking out the TV  And congratulations to the St. Louis Cardinals  Whatever  We spent 40 minutes on the Yankees and the Red Sox yesterday  And we're going to spend about 40 seconds on the fact that the St. Louis Cardinals beat the Houston Astros last night  Opie, I don't think you know it, but I'm a huge St. Louis Cardinals fan  Shut up  I have been for many, many years a huge Cardinals fan  I have to go with the Boston Red Sox 
[00:07:30]  I have to  Any of the team members' names have slipped my mind, but I'm a huge fan  Yeah, let's do a little test  How many St. Louis Cardinals do you know?  Let me think  Stan Musial  Tina Martinez  Let me think  No, Clemens was on the Astros, right?  Yeah  Let me think  Mark McGuire  Oh, right, right  No, no, no  I know one, Jim Edmonds 
[00:08:00]  Oh  I know Jim Edmonds, that's about it  Quick, give me the sports  I know, no, I like to see you sweat  It's my new favorite team  Quick  I wanted the Astros, but Clemens  I know  Did Clemens officially blow it, you think?  Ha-ha  He didn't have the best outing  The rocket was out of fuel  Yeah  Ha-ha  Cards beat the Astros  Five to two  Yeah  So now it's St. Louis and Boston in the World Series  You think they rioted in St. Louis like they did in Boston after the game?  Woo, they must have just rioted 
[00:08:30]  Throwing around maybe slices of bread or something equally as damaging  They threw toilet paper over the arches  Hey, why not?  Yeah  Knocked over a few garbage pails on the way home from the game  How many people did the St. Louis Police Department kill?  How many did they kill?  So far it's the Boston Police won  One  The St. Louis Police, zero  Yeah  Ouch  Ouch in Boston  You better hope they don't win the World Series, Ben 
[00:09:00]  Because you'll never be able to go back to an irradiated Boston  After they set off an atomic bomb  Yeah  Socks  Mushroom cloud over the city  Yeah, the city will burn down if Boston wins the World Series  You guys just can't keep it together  Can I just say the series or the city?  Oh my god  Okay  Alright  You guys can't keep it together  They killed a 21-year-old college girl  Because the fans are rioting 
[00:09:30]  And the cops have to go out there  I heard they were using shock grenades  And less lethal ammunition  What the hell is less lethal?  What the hell is less lethal ammunition?  It's all types of these various options to real ammunition  That is supposed to be less lethal  Are they the rubber bullets?  Rubber bullets are one type  This was the ammo this girl was hit with  It's supposed to fire out of a gun and then set off pepper spray 
[00:10:00]  So I guess it's a small canister that's fired probably out of a shotgun  And it hit her right in the eye  And she went down and that's it  And then she died in the hospital  And you know  You can't totally put the blame on the cops  Although Boston cops are known for being a little overzealous  Ben knows that  One visit he had to a bathroom that he never wants to talk about  Look at Ben  Ex-nay on the  Yeah  He's like  I don't want to talk  This was well over two years ago 
[00:10:30]  And he still doesn't want to talk about it  I'm not talking about any of this stuff  Ben got rousted  Did they drag you out and rip the bag you were standing in?  Ben got rousted once in a bathroom by a cop  So why wouldn't you talk about it?  Gus, it's Boston police  You don't talk about it  You end up in ten times worse shape  They're known for being a little  Boston is the most clicky  Between the politicians and the cops  It's like this massive corruption  And good old boy back patting 
[00:11:00]  Nepotism  Like you're in the club  And you're in  But anyone else  You can just do whatever you want  And no one looks twice  They just run it like that  Menino holds on to the mayor job like a pope  And there's no accounting for anything  No lie, when we did the mayor's prank  You know, we told the whole city of Boston  That the mayor died in a fiery car accident  For April Fool's  I was really scared  Yeah  There were cops that were following us for a while  Remember all this crap?  Yeah  Nothing ever happened 
[00:11:30]  So there's no real great ending to this story  But it was a scary time  Because, you know, we messed with the mayor  And the mayor's really close with the cops  And the next thing I know  I got, you know, Boston cops driving by my residence  And kind of just slowing down  And this and that  And I thought there was some paranoia going through my brain  Of course  It's a very, very corrupt city, Boston  And it's  There's no accountability on anyone's part  I'm surprised  And it's probably because of all the pressure they got 
[00:12:00]  That the cops came forward and said  We accept full responsibility for this girl's death  Because somebody had to have come down on her  But for the most part  They get away with whatever they want up there  Was she rioting or was she just standing there?  No, they say she was just a bystander  Just kind of, you know, celebrating the Sox victory  And a videotape supposedly shows the crowd  Just high-fiving each other  Jumping up and down, yelling  But nothing that would warrant firing off tear gas into the crowd 
[00:12:30]  So, you know, but who knows  You know, there's always two sides  The cops always have their side  And the people that were involved have their side  But, you know  And it looks like St. Louis  The fact is the girl's dead  Knows how to behave because nothing's going on  Nothing happened in St. Louis  They win, there's no rioting  They win game seven  And they just filed out nicely to their cars  And drove away  Back to their milquetoast lives  Boston's just out of control  They don't know what the hell to do with themselves 
[00:13:00]  They poured out into the streets  Drunk off their asses  And just started lighting everything in their sight on fire  Standing on top of cars  A couple of clowns trying to climb up the backside of the Green Monster  To get into Fenway  And they fell off  They fell off right onto Lansdowne Street  Yeah, one guy's in serious condition for doing that  Yeah, good  Well, Boston making Detroit very proud  I do believe  Yeah, doing them proud  You can only hope the guy that fell off the wall  15, 20 years from now 
[00:13:30]  When this is a distant memory  Is still in his wheelchair  Going  There were one day  When the rest of the way  And I've decided to  I very much regret it now  It's like stuff you gotta live with  Your whole life  And you just  People don't  They don't think  We all took those chances growing up  When you're younger  You just do stupid things  You know something  There was always a little bit of thought to it  You gotta think sometimes  What are you 
[00:14:00]  I don't know  What?  Go, go, what?  I always remember  Giving thought to consequence  Even growing up  Your whole life?  I did some really stupid things  But there was always the thought of the consequence  That's why I never did anything that might put other people in danger  You know, hey, let's roll this down this hill into the road  You know, when a car drives by  And I have friends that do that all the time  Even as simple as throwing the snowballs at the cars as they drive by  And I always thought  What would happen, you know  If it goes through an open window 
[00:14:30]  Cracks the guy  He swerves and hits a pole  And not that I didn't care about killing anyone  I just didn't want to go to jail  But I was always thinking about the consequence  Me and my brothers got the shit beat out of us one day  I gotta give them a call and see how old we were  But we were doing that exact thing  Throwing the snowballs at the cars  It's really a mainstay of youth  I was thinking we were being cool and  Look at that, we hit that car  But we were throwing ice balls and stuff  Hear that dull thud on the side of the door  And every time we hit one  Because we lived on a very busy street 
[00:15:00]  So the cars are coming by like crazy  So we're just throwing the snowballs  You hear the brakes come on and they slide on the ice  We're laughing  We think it's the funniest freaking thing  I swear, I don't think I was more than 12 years old  Maybe even less  And next thing I know  I guess what happened  Was one of these guys  Probably in his mid-twenties I would say  Those are the ones that chase you  He like  We didn't know this  But we hit his car  And we're laughing, you know  And I guess he went up the road a little bit  And stopped  You gotta do the flanking maneuver 
[00:15:30]  Oh, he flanked  You did the flanking maneuver  He was like two houses away  He comes through the woods  Back around  And we're still throwing snowballs  And he just attacks us  Of course he did  And beats the crap out of us  And we're just little kids, you know  Do you know how cool it is  In that situation  When your car does get hit  You're of the age  Where you're gonna confront these kids  And you pull over  And pull it off  You outflank them  You go all the way around  And the whole time you're just thinking  These little sons of bitches 
[00:16:00]  I hope they're still there  And when you see them there  The feeling you get  Oh, victory  I'm gonna go in there now  And kick these little bastards' asses  We never thought about consequences  Growing up  At all  I don't know why  I don't think it was instilled in me  From my parents or anything  It was just one of those things  I always thought  That this could get me really screwed  And I better just stay out of this  I wake up some mornings in a cold sweat  Because I'll think about some of the stuff  I did growing up  And go, I can't believe I took those chances  As a college kid 
[00:16:30]  Or what have you, you know  Yeah  So  There was some times  You would think about  You know, I would do things  That might have endangered myself  Especially with cars  When you're growing up as a teen  Who didn't drive drunk  You drive stupid  But I'm the best drunk driver  In the world, though  I don't even want to hear it  I don't even want to hear it  I'm great  I don't even swerve  But  You would pass the Brady Bunch test  But as a  Yeah, with the egg on the cone  With the egg  Of course  You could do that with like  A 12 pack  12  Jesus, who am I talking to? 
[00:17:00]  A case of beer  But that's just  Yeah  But that's just driving drunk  Because  Whenever I would drive drunk  And I really don't anymore  But when I would  I would  I would drive  Very good  I wouldn't speed  I would pay attention  To all the lights and everything  It's when I'm not drinking  That, you know  You drive a little faster  You might  Skirt that red light a little bit  You know, things like that  But drunk?  You gotta drive good  You'd be stupid to drive like an idiot  When you're drunk  We all did  And back in the day, man 
[00:17:30]  The cops would let you off the hook  Remember?  I think a lot of us have the story where  You know  Go right home  Right home?  No  You never had a cop  Take your buddy's keys  And make you wait around  Until his shift was over  And then come back  Give you the keys back  So you could drive home  That's the lesson they used to teach you  Instead of locking you up  You never had one of those happen?  No  Wow, I guarantee we go to the phones  We'll have a ton of them  I got pulled over  With a case of beer  With a few taken out  On my passenger seat  I was driving down the expressway  And I got pulled over 
[00:18:00]  I don't know  I think it was just because  I had long hair  And I was driving  An old beat up Nova  But I got pulled over  And the cop sees  The beers on the seat  And gives me a breathalyzer  And I passed it  And he said  He goes  I could hold you here a little longer  And make you do it again  To see if it got in your bloodstream  But I was talking fine  I wasn't slurring  I wasn't weaving or anything  And he let me go  Just let me go  Go ahead  The good old days  Now forget about it  You are locked up  Yeah no we used to get  Really hammered in Suffolk County  And yeah 
[00:18:30]  They would pull us over  And make you sit on the side  Sometimes  Sometimes like this  Happened a lot  It happened like once  But you know  He decided  He took our keys  His shift was over  Whatever  I don't remember anymore  Six, seven in the morning  And he made us just like  Wait until the end of his shift  He came back  Gave us our keys  At this point  We're completely exhausted  Just like falling asleep  On the side of the road  Hungover  The hangover's kicking in  Oh the hangover's kicking in  And there's not a diner in sight  To at least you know  Go eat or something 
[00:19:00]  And that's what he did  That's the lesson he taught us  And he's like  Alright now you guys can go home  Because it's been whatever  Four hours later  Oh it was awful man  It was absolutely awful  You know in Connecticut  And you didn't want to  You know  Call your parents or anything  And you know  So you had to kind of  Just wait it out  In Connecticut  You can still drive  With an open container  Really  The driver can't have it  But the passenger  Can have an open container  Really  Wow how they still have  That one on the books  Yeah you also can ride  A motorcycle without a helmet  In Connecticut  There you go  Yeah  Alright

It could be anybody  There's a million guys  Ben's like  I think it was sort of 
[00:23:30]  A case of mistaken identity  Or something  I'm not  I love the Boston police  It was rousting bop  Well who doesn't  Alright  Let's move on to Tampa  Hey Nick  Boston police  What do you got?  I wanted to ask Anthony  About  Set a fire to the woods  Or a street from his house  Yeah that was again  When I  You know  It was before you really  Realized consequences  I was in  I think I was in kindergarten  I was in kindergarten  A little kindergarten arsonist  Me and my brother  We stole some matches  And tried to burn the woods down 
[00:24:00]  We had to be corrected  Yeah we stole some matches  And we were lighting leaves on fire  Yeah I think every kid's done that  You play with the matches  And before you know it  There it goes  It gets a little too big for you  A little feet to stomp out  And the side of the hill went up on fire  Fire department comes down  And  That's the exact story I have  And you know what  I'm ashamed and embarrassed by this  Now Opie  But even as a kindergartner 
[00:24:30]  And where did I learn this  I have to look at my parents  And blame them  Because  When the  When the fire department came  And I was  Lil Anthony  I was in kindergarten  One of the firemen  Picked me up  And put his hat on my head  And asked  Who did this  And I looked at him  And said  It was two black guys  You did not  I swear to you  You did not  Very inappropriate  But even in kindergarten  Way to go Charles Stewart 
[00:25:00]  I know  Jeez  I blamed it on black guys  And how as a kindergartner  Do you get that ingrained in your head  It could have been my  Italian upbringing  Growing up in a house where  When my brother or something  Would ask my mother a question  Whether she had done the laundry  Or could you make me something to eat  She would turn around and say  What do I look  Three shades darker than you  You know  You grow up in that 
[00:25:30]  In that kind of environment  Perhaps  You grow up  So was anyone buying this story  That two black guys did it  I don't think so  You really can't come up with  Good lies as a kindergartner  In a first or second grade  Or whatever my brother was  I think I got you  I think I got you beat though  I had the same story  Me and my two brothers  I was trying to bring an outside source  Situation  I think I got you beat though  Situation  Yeah  Me and my brothers  Sixth grade 
[00:26:00]  Fifth grade  Fourth grade  I believe  Yeah  Did the same thing  We called it playing Vietnam  In the woods  Yeah  We had all the plastic soldiers  And we set up little wars and stuff  And it wasn't  Wasn't good enough  That it was the green men  Against the gray men  With the tanks and stuff  Yeah  That was cool for a while  Like alright  We're playing war man  You know  Me against you  Any good Vietnam scenario  Needs some napalm  Yeah  You set up the  You know  The bunkers and all this  After a while  It gets a little boring  Like let's introduce fire  Into our war games  Right 
[00:26:30]  Fire  So just like you  You know  We start with a little fire  You know  And then we make little fire  Like bombs  And throw it at the other guys  Soldiers and stuff  And it was all  Very cool  But then you know  A little fire gets boring  And you gotta up the ante  So now we're like  A little more fire  Now we're just piling leaves  Up around our war area  And now we're just  Setting the whole thing on fire  And just like you said  You know  Your little feet  Oh they stomp  Stomp and get the fire out  Gotta put that out  You're like okay  We survived that little 
[00:27:00]  You know  Brush of fire  Your little P.F. flyers  Right  Trying to put that out  So then we would  Make a little bigger fire  And now there's three of us  All  Put it out  Getting it out  Just in time  Oh look  A little fire squeezing out  Over there  You better get that  Randy got that one  So it got to the point  Like now there's a fire going  Now it's a little windy  I guess  The wind blows the fire  Into another pile of leaves  Which blows it into a tree  Next thing you know  We have a raging fire  In the backyard  I mean raging 
[00:27:30]  You know where I live  In Centiport  Yep  All the woods  I'm not kidding  I'm not kidding  Making that  Horrifying  Popping  Crackling  Fire noise  When you're a kid  And you look around  And you're the only people there  And you know you're responsible for it  And it's completely out of control  Completely out of control  But there's  Me and my brothers  Trying our best  Man now at this point  We're melting our sneakers  Yeah  We got like soot  All over our faces  I mean it is out of control  And you know  I was brought up  Was the soot on your faces 
[00:28:00]  So you'd have an alibi later  But you'd ask the neighbors  Who did it  And they'd just say  A couple of black guys  I saw in the woods  No  I was brought up with strict parents  And we knew  There was going to be hell to pay  Like no one's business  So we're like  We got to try to get this fire out  We're trying everything  The whole freaking woods  Is going up on fire  The trees everything  And at the top of the hill  Behind me is another house  Uh oh  That house  The side of it  Wasn't officially on fire  But very very close  Very close  Hot a little sooty  Of course the fire department  The Centerport Fire Department 
[00:28:30]  Comes and puts out the fire  But it took a  It did take a while  Yeah  And now like  You see the water on the trees  Dripping down  And half the woods are burnt up  And now they  Good job  Now they line me  And my two brothers up  And we got just little  White t-shirts  And our little jeans on  And our melted sneakers  Weighing a hundred pounds  Between all these  Oh yeah yeah yeah  The soot on our face  And they just line us up  The cops are there  And our parents  And we're like  Oh my god  And I'm like  Think fast  Think fast  I gotta get my brothers  Out of this man  Right 
[00:29:00]  So they're like  Do you guys know  What happened back there  It's so obvious we did it  And I'm like  You know officer  I did see some oily rags  While I was playing  In the woods with my brother  You came up with  The spontaneous combustion alibi  Hey man  We had fire prevention  In school  Like that week  And they said  That oily rags  Can be very dangerous  Around the house  And the garage  Sure they bought that one  So I said  Yeah I remember  When we were running  Around the woods  I saw some oily rags  Oily rags 
[00:29:30]  They didn't buy it  And we were like  We were punished  The whole summer  Couldn't like  Use our woods  Which was just  Devastating  Which was burnt down anyway  Yeah  Pretty much  But then you know  My parents were sick  F's man  Because we weren't allowed  To leave our driveway  For the whole summer  Okay  That was your punishment  And I mean  Our backyard  Was a huge playground  We had our tree forts  And everything  You know  And my cousins  And stuff would come over  And they would be allowed  To run around the woods  And we would just sit  In the driveway  You'd have to watch them  And watch them 
[00:30:00]  Have a grand old time  Up there  But I blamed it  On the oily rags  In the woods  So  See this is what kids do  Jim  They don't play  Monster rain  Yeah monster rain  I think monster rain  Is more fun  Than that awful fire  In the woods  At least no one  Got hurt  Notice that  Ant and I's story  Had nothing to do  With sucking cock  But it would have soon  It would have soon  A couple boys  Frolicking in the woods  Believe me  You weren't far off  Setting fire  I'm gonna tell  Unless you zip  Believe me  One sideward glance 
[00:30:30]  During a group tinkle  And it would have all been  Downhill from there  Let's say hi to Rob  Hey Rob  What's up Rob  What's up guys  I got a little  Snowball story  Okay  We used to have  This Jamaican bus driver  Used to drive so fast  Over the hills  He didn't care  He was like  Just make sure  You got your seatbelt man  So what we used to do  Was we used to rip  The cushions out of the buses  And used to peg people  In the front  This guy didn't care  So we were like  Alright  Maybe when the winter comes  We can get away with it  You know  Take it outside  So what me and my friend 
[00:31:00]  Did was we used to  Pile snowballs  From like the school  When it snowed  They used to pile it up  In the parking lot  So we used to  Pack in the snowballs  And shopping  And I'm talking about  Bring in like  Ten shopping bags  Into the bus  Yes  Oh my god  Hello  He's our first  Lost caller  Rob  Rob  Hello  Hi  Back up 20 seconds  We missed some  Part of that story there  God damn cell phones  Anyways  So we used to  Pile snowballs 
[00:31:30]  Into the shopping bags  And used to  Synchronize people  In certain windows  So we would have  Strikers in the back  We'd have like  Fireers in the front  And I'm talking about  We used to  Peg people on the outside  Like when we would  Get a target  We'd just  Throw snowballs  Like crazy  At these fucking people  And then we'd have like  We'd be like  Alright there's one over here  And we used to peg  I mean just like  Old people  Like no care in the world  I'm talking about like  Like hit someone  With balls  And someone in the head  And the bus driver  He couldn't care less  We got pulled over 
[00:32:00]  One time by  A guy whose car got hit  He was like  I don't care man  I'm not losing my job  For this bullshit  It fucking pulls away  I'm talking about like  Just crazy shit  I mean this is like  Unbelievable  Alright  Rob  Where's the funny ending?  Yeah  It says on the screen  Snowball story  With funny  Funny ending  I think the Jamaican guy  Pulling away  Was like kind of  The funny ending  But then it got like  A one  Yeah  I just didn't care man  That was a funny ending 
[00:32:30]  If you're Tony Danza  I have a story  Do you have a story  Finally Jim?  Yeah yeah  I just didn't want to  Interrupt here  The story's really flowing  It's not quite  A snowball story  Oh god  However it is true  It involves balls  No  Well you know what  In an odd way it may  Listen and hear how  Jim Norton grew up  A lot differently  Than Anthony and I  I did all the snowball stuff  Believe me  Me and my friend Marvin  Would hide  Yeah all that stuff  Marvin Nash  Hide under the porch  No not under the porch 
[00:33:00]  El creepo  This was many years later  Did you have monster  Snowstorms too?  What the hell  Did that entail?  Butt rape?  God  It's um  When I was like 16  I used to drink a lot  So we were riding around  And what we would do  Is we would urinate  Into cups  And try to throw it  On people  See  It's always a little different  Just involves something  Just a little different  So one time  We were in New Brunswick  And we peed into  I peed into a cup  And I put like a little lid  On it so I couldn't  Lose the urine in transit 
[00:33:30]  You wouldn't be tempted  To drink it  Not as long before those days  I was a rookie  So we stopped one time  And we saw a guy  And a girl walking together  And I took my cup of urine  And I flung it out  The passenger window  And the girl put her arm up  Oh no  And the cup  Hit her arm  And pissed you up  All over both of them  That's pretty funny  It was the greatest thing  I've ever done  That is pretty funny  Alright  We'll try a couple more of these  And then we'll move on  Right  John from Staten Island  What's up John 
[00:34:00]  Hey guys  How are you  Good  Hi  One time  My friend and I  We were driving  We were about 18  Pulling to a Burger King  We were being stupid inside  They'd kick us out  We have to leave  Ten minutes later  We drive by  The cops are sitting  In the parking lot  We say  Hey what's going on in there  Pull in  Everybody comes running out  Says there he is  There he is  Get that guy  So what happened  Cops  Take my license  Piss drunk  Piss drunk  What ends up happening  The cops takes my keys

[00:35:00]  And you didn't want  To get pulled over  You knew the number  Of his car  And he had  He had white hair  And he looked to be about  I don't know  50 years old  But the story was  He was only 25  And he had seen  This bad wreck  Where like  10 kids were  Just hamburger  All over the road  Tangled all over the tree  Overnight  Opie  Overnight  His hair turned white  And he got  The stone face  And if you got  Pulled over by him 
[00:35:30]  And you were out  Partying  Driving fast  Or drinking  He was gonna  Beat the crap out of you  And haul you into jail  And that was  You never wanted to get  Pulled over by  Stone face  Was it a true story?  Of course it was  No  Rudy from Plainview  What's up?

[00:39:00]  With the chick in the car  He's like  Go in the house  And do yourself a favor  Go in right now  So I go in the house  And I'm sitting in the house  And listening to them  Go upstairs  And now they're banging  Oh dude  Oh this is painful  And you just gotta sit there  The girl of your dreams  Is just getting slammed  By my upstairs neighbor  Who now mind you  Has known for the past  Six months or so  That I've been dying  To get with this chick  Wow that is rough

He didn't do anything wrong  He just banged  Yeah  The guy didn't do anything wrong  You sound like the type of guy  That couldn't do any revenge  No not really  You sound kind of  Submissive  Yeah you sound kind of  Submissive  Kind of wimpy  Yeah  Do you know what I would do  For revenge?  I mean this might be too harsh  I don't know if I can even  Get in trouble for suggesting  This  But you ought to call  His place really late at night  And when he answers  Ask him if he has  Prince Albert in a can  And if he says yes 
[00:40:00]  Say well then  You better let him out  Yeah  He doesn't own a bowling alley  Does he?  No  Call up and ask  If he has 10 pound balls  And then ask him  How does he walk?

I didn't hear moaning  So I'm guessing not very good 
[00:40:30]  So maybe I spilled out some  He was rocking back and forth  With his hands over his ears  Going no  No  No  It was kind of like  When Private Pyle is screaming  He was just laying on his back  With his hands over his head  Like Joker  Yep  So basically I just sat here  Drinking a beer  Chain smoking cigarettes  Thinking  God I feel like a pussy  Well when was the last time  You got laid?

[01:19:00]  Ah yeah  Wow  On the phone Jennifer from New York with some teen news  Yes Jennifer  Hey so like I said I'm 18  And basically there's this guy in my building who actually happens to be 40  Now I have this thing for older guys right  And I've known him for several years  And basically he's hot for his age  And I've been trying to get him for a while  Now I'm pretty attractive you know  I don't see anything wrong with me  So you know I've been like talking to him for a while already 
[01:19:30]  He thinks I'm attractive  And the thing is I just want to bang him already  So I just want to know what do you think I should do to get him  Ring his bell  This is a no brainer  Jesus  I have an idea though  If that's not working  You might want to bang a 36 year old comedian first  And work your way up  Because sometimes that helps  That'll make him jealous  Like where's the problem?  I don't understand but like  If you're 18 he's 40  Where's the problem?  It's either that he's got kids home or you're a mess 
[01:20:00]  He doesn't seem interested?  No he definitely seems interested  He already told me he thinks I'm hot  Yeah  And it's like the first time we try to hook up  It's like it just didn't work out  What didn't work out?  Well the thing is I went over his house the first night right?  Yeah  And he was like alright when you come back from going out  Give me a call back  I winded up coming home too late  And I called him and he was fucking sleeping  So that freaking did a work out  Jesus  Yeah exactly  And then the next day I call  And then like he's already out 
[01:20:30]  So there was no point in that  And freaking he works during the week  So it's like I hardly see him  So my only chance is during the weekend  Now I was over his freaking house  And he didn't even make a move  So what am I supposed to just like  Pounce on him and do something?  Alright  Is he gay?  No he's not  Is he married?  Nope  What do you look like?  Yeah this is  I think this is where the problems start  No  Definitely not  Jennifer  Alright give us the vital stats  Let's go Jennifer  What do you look like?  What do you look like?  I'm about 5'1 right? 
[01:21:00]  I'm  Be honest with the weight  I am  I'm about 105 pounds  105 pounds  So far so good  I'm half Spanish  And half Irish  Greek and German  Right  And I have long brown hair  And brown eyes  Big boobs  Small boobs  I like how she's half  Of some  Five things  Yeah  I know  I'd say I'm about a 34B  34B?  Very nice  And I'm athletic  So I work out  Wow  What's the problem?  I don't know  I don't know  I mean 
[01:21:30]  It's just like  He just sits there  He doesn't do anything  Maybe you found a guy  With morals  No maybe he's got ED  Maybe he's got erectile dysfunction  And he's ashamed  Or maybe you're too old for him  Maybe another thing too  Is the fact that he knows my parents  I don't know  That would turn me on more  What is he friends with your parents?  Oh  Oh he's friends with your parents?  That might be a problem  How great is that  You look your buddy right in the eye  With the smell of his daughter  On your mule?  God that would be a turn on  You know how you raised her up 
[01:22:00]  And gave her those little birthday presents  Pin the tail on the donkey  When it was her birthday  And you raised her  Well I'm banging her now  Has he given any indication  That he wants you?  Uh yeah  He's like  Me  He's like implied something  So he's like  Well I saw  Like you have a great ass  You're beautiful  You're gorgeous  You're this or that  It's like nothing but compliments  But no action  So why do you want him so bad?  Because he's hot  He's hot  Yeah  And he doesn't have a girlfriend  Nope  Not at the moment at least  Well maybe  Here you go 
[01:22:30]  You gotta get a little more physical  You gotta get a little closer to him  Yeah you think it'd be on my part?  Because like I think he's just scared  Probably scared  Because if he hits on you  And misreads you  And you reject him  He's probably afraid  You'll tell your father  And it'll be an embarrassment for him  Hey we got a 26 year old plumber  From Philly that wants you  Want a plumber?  No that's all right  How about a 24 year old guy  That puts little stickers on eggs  In Buffalo  I don't understand why she doesn't like me 
[01:23:00]  Yeah  Sometimes I'll even change the sticker  From the eggs to the milk  And give her a discount  It's not funny how he  Oh I gotta change the date  We asked what he did  And he came up with the worst job ever  Yeah that's gonna sit with me all weekend  Great  That guy  I don't know what to say on this one Jennifer  Do you rub your ass against his junk  When you're like passing in front of him and stuff?  I just I mean I haven't really done much  I just said a lot of things  I haven't done anything with  Wait do you sit on the couch or something  And talk with him?  Yeah  Yeah do you sit real close? 
[01:23:30]  Uh sort of  Do you put your hand on his leg?  I haven't done that yet  Yeah maybe you ought to do that  I think you might need to just strip in front of him  I think the second you get a little physical with him  Uh huh  Like the talking can go back and forth for a while  But the second you get a little physical  Even a little touch or something  Uh huh  Then the floodgates will open up  Make it so he couldn't help himself  So he has an alibi  When he talks to your parents next time  Wait the thing is what?  The thing is I'm pretty straightforward usually right?  But for some reason with this guy  I'm like a nervous fuck with him 
[01:24:00]  I can't do shit  Oh she'd be quivering and shaking  Yeah so young and frightened  Oh nice  Are you sexually active?  Yeah I am  Yeah what do you do?  Um  What do you do?  Don't worry about it  Come on tell us  Yeah what's the freakiest thing you do?  What would you consider freaky?  That's a good point  Oh you're talking to three guys  That have heard it all  So  What's the freakiest thing you've ever done?  Freak  I'm going to say it up here  Why not?  No one knows who you are  Yeah we have no idea who you are 
[01:24:30]  We don't know where you're calling  It's got to be one of those things  That are in your head  And you know  Comes up and you go  Wow I can't believe I did that  I mean  I've gotten tied to the bedpost one time  So I mean  That's pretty freaky  I like that  Nice  I like the tied up thing  You do?  No I don't  I don't normally  I don't get it  But when I hear 18 and tied up  That really does make it better  18 and anything  Yeah  Have you ever  18 and snot bucket on the side of your bed  Hot  Yeah that's still hot  Puke bucket  You said it was snot 
[01:25:00]  Well it's snot when the girls aren't puking  Yeah  It's a multi-purpose bucket  Jennifer  Yeah  Have you ever  Have you ever masturbated on a radio show before?  No and I'm not going to  Damn it  How about  You could play What's in Your Pants  What's that?  Oh  That's where you take your phone  Uh huh  And you rub it on your genitalia  Yeah you're right  And we can tell what type of hairstyle you have down there  Just based on the sound it makes 
[01:25:30]  So you're not as freaky as you're trying to say you are  It's not a perverted game  You're not putting the phone in you  You're just rubbing it over the area of where your pubic hair is or lack of  Yeah  And we have to guess what  We have to guess what you have  How about I just tell you  That's not fun  We like to guess  We have a contest here  On who can guess  I don't think she's going to do it  I'm not begging today  Chris from Jacksonville  You have advice for Jennifer?  Oh we're doing that again  Yeah we want to  Come on 
[01:26:00]  Help me out here  Yeah  Hello Chris  Oh you have to do it that way?  Hello Chris  Oh  Alright  Hey Chris  There you are  Go ahead Chris  Hey  All you got to do is just take your fucking hand  And put it right on his cock  That's pretty straightforward  Yeah that's all  Yeah  Come on it's a gross motor skill  It's not going to require too much thinking  That move seems to work every time  It's a trigger for me  It means I want to fuck  That's true  That's pretty straightforward  And what you want to really do is if you put your hand on his mule 
[01:26:30]  Look at him really innocent  And go  Don't tell my daddy  Believe me  That's right  And if you really have a problem  Just stick it in your mouth  See  Helpful advice  Alright Jennifer  Yeah  There you go  A little physical contact  And I think you're in  Yeah  Or he's in or whatever  Yeah I don't think you're slutty enough for our radio show  Yeah  You're boring us now  Yeah you're not quite slutty enough  But 18  That's fine  We love the 18 year old thing  And you know  Give us a call back if you get anything going with this guy  Okay  We'll need an update 
[01:27:00]  Okay  Alright there goes Jennifer  Sounds hot  I don't know  A lot of updates on this show  A lot of things that need updating  Nothing wrong with that  No  Okay  I got the horny dentist story of the day  Yeah  Seems like a lot of these  Dentists  Freaky  Well they got that  You know  They can knock you out in the chair  And then  Yeah there really isn't anything else  You don't walk into a deli  You order a sandwich  And then the guy knocks you out  While he makes the sandwich  Right  And then you wake up  And he gives you the sandwich 
[01:27:30]  It's pretty much  Only a dentist  I think it's a fine profession  Because if you're in a doctor's office  Or in the hospital  There's always people around  You can't just knock out the patient  A lot of people around  But the dentist  You know  It's the little room  You knock them out with some laughing gas or something  And then  There's no one else around  They knock you out  You wake up  You have no recollection of what happened  And you leave like  He did you a favor  Her mouth is open  When she's done  You just go  Alright spit  Yeah  He even tells you to spit  Go ahead  Spit that nastiness out of your mouth 
[01:28:00]  You know  You fill her mouth  And then just take that little thing  And you're just suction it out  And no one knows nothing  Suck it up  Alright you can hang up on  All the people on hold  Because we're trying to find  A couple to try to  Become the sexiest state in America today  To try to beat out Illinois  I think we can get that happening  Alright so it's  The horny dentist story here  Leave a little goo on that  Little blue apron thing  They put on you  With that little chain  That goes around the back of your neck  Clean it up  Dentist asked 
[01:28:30]  To grope this patient  As pay  Uh huh  Okay  A Brooklyn dentist  Tried to trade dental work  For a cheap thrill  When a former employee  Came to him  With a toothache  Dr. Ceres Mittal  Offered to treat Yvette  But only if he could  Grope her breasts  Anthony  As payment  So this one  Like he asked  Usually they don't even ask  No  You're passed out  And they have  They have their way with you  She must have had a great set  Who just lost complete control  And goes  I gotta touch those 
[01:29:00]  I gotta  I have to risk everything  To touch those  He was looking at them  Every time she walked into his office  They were jiggling  And he wanted to just smash her  God I gotta touch those  The woman said she tape recorded  The whole episode  Because she remembered  Her ex-boss's  Inappropriate behavior  And expected more of the same  Did she work for  Bill O'Reilly?  No?  Well maybe she worked for  Bill  Good old Bill  A recording made available  By her attorney  Captures the alleged  Exchange between the dentist 
[01:29:30]  And his patient  This is a quote Anthony  I'll fix that  I gotta fix it  A voice  Identified as the dentist  Is heard saying  So can I have those?  So he's looking at her tooth  Obviously saying  I'll fix that  I gotta fix it  Yeah  But then he looks down  And goes  Can I have those?  That can mean anything though  She could be holding  A tray of  Sweets  Yeah goodies  Yvette replies  Oh I'll have those  Well Yvette  She replies  No you can't have my  And it's breasts in parentheses  And this is the paper 
[01:30:00]  Yeah  So that means the word  Was probably worse than breasts  Tits  Hot  No you can't have my  Tits  Breasts  To which the dentist  Allegedly answers  Why?  How am I gonna help you then?  She's holding her hostage  In that chair  Dick  I gotta let you touch my breast  She asks  The dentist says  Yeah  The dentist's lawyer  Says it's all crap  We've heard the recordings  Months ago  We don't think they  Substantiate the claim  They don't 
[01:30:30]  He's  Pretty freaking obvious to me  Lawyers are amazing  The lawyers will spin anything  In your favor  All right  We've heard the recordings  Months ago  Yeah  We don't think they  Substantiate the claim  Yvette  32  Said the dentist  Allegedly groped her  Made inappropriate comments  And forced her to watch  Him masturbate  As he sat in his  Dentist chair  When she was his  Receptionist  Oh she was his receptionist  Yeah she used to work  For this guy  Point yeah  This is where she's  So stupid 
[01:31:00]  She worked in his  Basement office  On 4th Avenue  For a few months  Last year  So she worked for the guy  Knows he's a little  Fry-racking  Yeah why would she  Then go to him  As a dentist  If she had already  Had problems with him  Right  She already watched  The guy masturbate  Okay  Yvette  A mother of four  Was afraid to bring  Her allegations to the police  And felt more comfortable  Dealing with the lawyer  Yvette put up with  The dentist's behavior  Because she needed  The job  After she quit  This is where  She has the problem  She went back 
[01:31:30]  To the dentist  For treatment  Because she was strapped  What  Oh no money  She had no money  She was desperate  So even though  She watched this guy  Masturbate before  She went back  She'd get a freebie  She went back  Because she had a toothache  And decided to go back  To the guy  She just went  To get a payment  She figured she'd record him  She knew he's a weak man  Yeah  And she just went back  To record her  To get a payment  That was it  And then there's  Another claim  This  Carmen Vasquez  A former patient  Joined in on the lawsuit  Anthony  Joined in 
[01:32:00]  Charging that the dentist  Fondled her breast  As he placed dental instruments  In her mouth  Love this guy  And of course  The dentist says  The charges have no merit  Of course  Of course  God I love those stories  Dentists are freaks  Those hit the papers  From time to time  They just  I guess they lead  The boring dental life  And you got a woman  Unconscious in the chair  Right in front of you  Yeah  Gotta make the move  Gotta make the move  Filthy gums  Needing repair 
[01:32:30]  Might as well  Cup her tits  For a few minutes  Before you get in there  And dig out  That plaque and stink  I like the ones  That forget to button  Them up after they're done  It's like  Oh I woke up  And I noticed  My shirt was undone  My blouse was undone  To the fifth button  Come on doc  Can you figure this one out  You got plenty of time  Take a Polaroid beforehand  So you can match it with her  When she's waking up  Be a little smart about it  No ass  No ass  Leave a big load  Right there on her tongue  Wake up  And how did she watch him 
[01:33:00]  Masturbate while he was  Doing dental work  What are you doing  Come on  Just watch for a second  Hey check this out  Yeah  He's in the chair  With his rotten  Dentist slacks  Pulled down  And his older  Gentleman ankles  A little mirror  Poking out of his pocket  Jiggling in his pocket  As he's cranking away  Oh god  Wonderfully awful  Nick from Ohio  Checking in  You want sex on the show  Say something to me  Or in general  Over the radio

[01:42:00]  The O.P. and Anthony Show  All right, we're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show  We're waiting for Nick from Ohio to give us a call 
[01:42:30]  He's going to attempt to take the title away from Illinois and become the sexiest state in America  Yeah, where is he?  He's waking up his wife as we speak and he wants to bang her live on the show  Gotta love the satellite radio, huh?  Very good  All right  What else is going on today?  We're all over the place  I was just noticing on TV that they, uh, uh, Kerry's doing more of these photo ops  He's doing a lot of photo ops as we get very, very close to the election  Oh, the paper's full of them 
[01:43:00]  He's, uh, his latest one, hunting  The hunting Kerry  He's, uh, he was goose hunting  And they have a picture of him  In his camouflage hunting gear  Uh, carrying a shotgun  And, uh, a buddy is behind him  Carrying a fowl  Carrying a dead goose  A dead fowl  And these are your typical  Your typical election is coming up  Photo op  Because this photo right here  Is to try to woo 
[01:43:30]  Woo  Some of the gun lobby over to him  Like, like the gun lobby is gonna look  Gun owners  And they're gonna look and go  Wow, okay, look, he's hunting  Uh, we gotta vote for this guy  Like, this is gonna change the gun lobby to vote for a liberal Democrat  Knowing that they, you know, they're all about guns  And letting people, uh  There's Kerry hunting  Exercise their right to bear arms  Yeah, yeah  Kerry's hunting?  Oh, well, of course  Well, the night before they had him doing a photo op, too 
[01:44:00]  He was with his buddies watching the Red Sox win  Uh-huh  And he was drinking a beer, Anthony  Drinking a beer like a regular guy  He's just like you and I  They pull these out, though  Because the other day I saw one of, uh, Bush  A photo op of him, uh, performing an abortion  He was, uh, just squatting down  And pulling out the little, the little fetus  And it's just to woo the other side  John Kerry, they actually, uh, asked him about that hunting photo  And he said that, um  Here we go  They wanted to know why, why he had driven through one of the worst storms in Texas 
[01:44:30]  In the last 50 years to go hunting  And they asked him if he caught any, shot any geese  And he said, I believe the boy's got a couple  He said that  Yeah, sure  Yeah, sure  I didn't see that in the paper, but okay  It's all those, uh, photo ops where you see them  Uh, they go to the schools, Opie  And they read to the children  And for some reason, uh, it's always a school of little black children  That they're reading to 
[01:45:00]  I have never, and this is every politician  I have never seen them reading  To a, uh, group of white children  Or actually any other race  It's always the black children that they're reading to  Well  As a matter of fact, I think George Bush was reading to a room full of black children on 9-11  He sure was  And he was like, whew, thank God  Now I can get the hell out of here  What about, um, the other day  One of these guys was, uh, doing the black church thing  Yeah, yeah  All the politicians have to do the black church thing  Well, Kerry was, uh, doing that 
[01:45:30]  Yes, you know, singing and clapping and joining in  And is anyone believing that if, if Kerry did get elected  Um, or even, even if he doesn't  That he's ever gonna go to these black churches again  That it was anything but a photo op to try to get more voters to vote for him  He's gonna sit there and clap  Yeah, and Jesus  We love Jesus  It just, he's so out of place  It looks ridiculous  There's no way you, you think 
[01:46:00]  He's really enjoying himself being there  Insincere goal  It really is  A bunch of Baptists singing causes a ruckus  Yeah, causing a big ruckus  Both sides do it though  They both, uh, look for those photo ops  Did he sit down and, in the chair, lean back and go  Ooh, Lord  And start fanning himself with a fan  Ooh, Lord, Lord, let me tell you  Amen  A bunch of insincere drivel that they think, uh, you know, I would for once just love to, to know what they both stand for 
[01:46:30]  No crap  Instead of the bashing back and forth, let's hear what you're gonna do  And, uh, make a decision based on that  Not photos of him hunting and, and just bullshit from both parties back and forth about what an ass the other guy is  Tell me what you're gonna do for me  It just never happens like that  You really don't know what Kerry's gonna do for you?  Does anybody?  No  And Bush, no one knows  The only thing Bush has done on anything is talk about how we need to be in Iraq 
[01:47:00]  And how we need to fight this war on terror  Alright, great, that's fine, we do  We need to fight the war on terror  But, what else?  The president isn't just about, you know, let's go into a country and, and make them free  We kind of have some problems here in America  There's stuff that needs to be dealt with here  And, uh, that's all taking a back seat  I have no clue what either of these guys stand for on so many issues  The whole election is about Iraq  This election is about Iraq 
[01:47:30]  Why is gas up to well over $2 a gallon?  Why are the, uh, $55 a barrel?  I thought at least we would have cheaper gas by now  Can we do something about that?  Is something being done about that?  I have no clue  I don't know  Bomb Syria  Bomb Syria?  Take a few of them out of the mix  I like that  No  It just, it's, it's all a bunch of crap  No one can make a, an informed decision  Because neither of these nitwits want to go out on a limb  And actually say what they're going to do  It's just better to sit there and call the other one an ass 
[01:48:00]  Well, they look at the polls and then they say the right thing  That's the problem with our leaders in America, you know  Yeah  You don't have a guy that just speaks his mind  Doesn't worry about the polls  The polls have become everything  So, oh, the abortion people aren't really digging us right now  So then they, you know, make a statement to try to get those numbers up  That's what it's all about  Yeah, where are we, where are we sagging  And how can we lift those numbers up?  Yeah, where are the leaders of the past where they just spoke their minds  And you respected that, you know?  Yeah  I didn't like Giuliani at all when he was the mayor of New York 
[01:48:30]  And then he made this huge comeback with the whole 9-11 thing  But the one thing I respected about Giuliani was he spoke his mind  And didn't give a crap what you thought about it  I like that in a politician  I want a politician  I walk softly but carry a big stick  You know, those guys  The buck stops here  Yeah, we need a politician with a top hat  The big dopey top hat and a cane  That's when they used to speak their minds  Right  And then jumped on their horse and buggy  We need to hose down the colored people 
[01:49:00]  Like the old, what?  Well, maybe not that far  What, he was down in the polls with the KKK?  Down in the polls  What the F is wrong with you?  Release the hounds!  No?  You need a leader that speaks his mind and doesn't pay attention to the polls  You mean he wants somebody who says what he means and means what he says  Hey, there you go!  I learned a lot of those things from black radio stations  They have the coolest expressions  Alright  If you don't stand for something, you'll fall for anything 
[01:49:30]  Oh, I like that one  Me too, me too  Okay, we got a couple people from Ohio on the line  Melanie  What does Melanie want to do?  Does anyone know?  Wife in the bathroom?  Yeah, we got to go to Nick  That's a good one  Well, that's Nick  But I want to see if we're going to have a little Ohio competition today  Melanie, what's up?  Hi  Hey, why are you calling?  Hello  I'd like to play Guess What's in My Pants  Ah!  Ooh  Alright, it's not a competition of sexy estate, Opie  But still more gooder  Well, you know what? 
[01:50:00]  We do need a warm-up act  Doesn't have lots of time  Well, that's her  Is that what it says?  That's her  So we have to go to Melanie if we want to play Guess What's in My Pants  Okay  And then we're going to go to Nick  Hold on, hold on there, Melanie  Okay  We might have to make an executive decision here  What?  Uh, whatever  Nick, what's up?  Nick  What?  What happened?  Nick hung up  Thank God we kept Melanie on hold  Maybe Nick hit the wrong button  I'm hoping  Alright, Melanie, you're in Ohio?  Yes  You're 26 years old? 
[01:50:30]  Yes  What do you look like?  Um, I'm 5'4", 125 pounds  Mm-hmm  That's in range  Long blonde hair  Okay  Green eyes  Blonde green eyes, nice  Uh, natural blonde?  Uh, I was until about 21 and then it all went to hell since then  Mr. Blonde  Alright, so it's not going to be as coarse down there if you're a natural blonde  Oh  See, this is the type of things we figure out before we even play the game  Yeah  Everything, uh, changed  I'm like, holy shit, that changed too  Green eyes, what kind of nationality? 
[01:51:00]  Uh, American  A little bit of everything  Alright, you're a mutt like myself  Good  Like the last girl, are you half Irish, half Jewish, half German, and half Polish?  No  I'm Slovenian, uh, German  Melanie, as you get naked, who are you going to vote for in the election?  Well, let me tell you something, my crunk, McFriend  Who are you going to vote for in the election?  Uh, probably Kerry  You guys are the swing state, you understand that?  Yeah  No president  Uh, wait, how does this go now? 
[01:51:30]  No president has won the election  After losing the first three?  Without winning Ohio  Oh, really?  Yes  Hmm  So, you guys are the  That's not true though, that Hubert Humphrey did that  What?  Ooh  Are you kidding me?  I don't know what I'm talking about  Ah, that was very good, because it sounded good, you know, no one would have known that  No, some nerd would have called in  Hubert Humphrey  The whole nation is depending on Ohio in this election  If you're a Kerry fan, you gotta hope that, uh, he wins Ohio 
[01:52:00]  Hmm  Okay, so, you're voting for Kerry, why?  Uh  You're getting naked as you talk to us, right?  Yes  Okay, good  Ah, very good, very good  I wanna know why you're voting for Kerry  Um  Most people don't know why they vote for a candidate, by the way  They just look on TV and go, ah, ah, he looks good  Ah  Um, I think it's the whole war situation  The whole war situation  Yeah, I don't want him to be over there  Okay  But Kerry isn't saying he's pulling them out  I know  So, why would you vote for Kerry? 
[01:52:30]  Uh, I don't know  Like, people think if you're for the war, you vote for Bush  If you're against it, you vote for Kerry  But, um, he's not pulling them out  But this is how people decide  I know  I mean, we are very, and I'm speaking for myself, too  I don't know crap about politics  I pretend to know on the radio  Me, too  But we're all a bunch of dummies, and we're just pulling levers  For the stupidest reasons in the world  Hmm  All right, so you're voting for Kerry  Because you, uh, you don't want our guys over there  Exactly  Wow 
[01:53:00]  And as a matter of fact, Kerry  Said he's going to send more troops over there  Because he doesn't believe there's enough over there  To get the job done  Well, that's not good  Dang, you didn't know that?  No, I gotta research more  I got, what, a week?  See, here's where we are  You might want to read a newspaper  Maybe  All right, are you naked?  Yeah  Hey, do you have nice boobs?  Uh, 36B  36B  Okay  All right, I'm writing that down  I don't know how that's going to fix  Does that even come into play?  I really don't know  I'm trying to figure out if it does 
[01:53:30]  But, okay  So you're now naked in your room?  No, actually  I'm standing on my back deck  Because my husband's sleeping  So I have to make this quick  You're outside naked?  You're cheating on your husband right now  With a radio show?  Yeah  Oh, God, you're hot  Do you just want to be banged or what?  Yeah, exactly  Lack of socks  Are you a faithful wife?  Have you ever strayed a bit?  No  Wait, you have  You're not getting sex?  Nope  Why?  I don't know  I think he's gay  Oh, Jesus  I played Guess What's in My Pants 
[01:54:00]  With my neighbor like a week ago  And he's like  You gotta call the show  You played Guess What's in Your Pants  With your neighbor?  Yeah  Oh, boy  How long have you been married?  Three years  Three years  When was the last time you had sex with him?  Two and a half months ago  Two and a half months?  And he's just not into it?  Nope, he's not  Why?  I have no idea  Think he's cheating?  No, I think he's gay  Was he at first?  No, never  Why do you think he's gay?  Because I'm a tractor chick  And he doesn't want to have sex with me  There's something wrong  And you just want sex all the time, right? 
[01:54:30]  Yeah  Oh, tell us more  My morals are screwed up  According to him  Because you want to have sex?  Is he religious?  No  Are you going to bang the neighbor?  You there?

I had another call at  8 o'clock in the morning  Are you going to bang the neighbor?  I don't know  Yeah  She'll bang the neighbor  Yeah, you'll be banging the neighbor 
[01:55:00]  You just don't want to say it on your XM satellite radio  Because we repeat the show all weekend long  And you might be in the car with your boring husband  And he's going to hear that you want to bang the neighbor  And then you will be in trouble  Uh-huh  Make sure you don't turn on the radio this weekend  Yeah  All right  You'll be in Dutch  Wow  This is  So you just want to get banged all the time  And he's not interested  Nope, not at all  Maybe he's straying  I don't think so  You don't think so  Why do you think he's gay?  Did you answer that?  Um, I don't know 
[01:55:30]  He's always telling me about, like, gay people and stuff  Really?  He's running into this gay guy  And this guy's attractive  And he tells you that guys are attractive?  He points out attractive guys?  Uh, just like  Oh, I've seen, you know  A halfway decent looking guy, you know  And I'm like, okay  Wow  Hmm  So what are you going to do about this?  I don't know  I have no idea  Wow  You want to masturbate for us?  I feel like you need something today  No, I already did this morning  You did?  You got a little vibrator? 
[01:56:00]  No  No?  What do you use?  Just my finger  Yeah  Just one?  Yeah  Well, yeah, you don't have sex  That's all she needs  That's all you need  The clit flick  Oh  Oh, there you go  You spanked the clit a little bit with your finger?  Yeah  Oh, there you go  Very nice  Lovely  Oh, anyway  What?  What are we doing?  We're going to play What's in Her Trousers  Yeah, I'd rather hear her take care of herself, though  You got another one in you there?  Not on my back, Doc 
[01:56:30]  It's kind of cold out here  Come on, baby  All right, you know how the game's played, right?  Angry Ray is on the line  He says,  Opie has no effing clue on politics  I hadn't just admitted that, you idiot  Jeez  Captain Obvious calling in  Come on, baby  No?  Yep  All right, we'll play Guess What's in My Pants  Yeah  Do you want to explain this, Anthony?  Yeah  To the new listeners out there?  Yes, we take Melanie  A lovely lady like Melanie  Who has her cell phone  And she will rub it on her area 
[01:57:00]  Between her legs, Opie  And we will discern  What type of hairstyle she has down there  Just by the sound  That comes out of the phone  How about that?  And the choices  Are the 70's Earth Mama Muff  Or the Au Natural  Or the pool rack full of Afro hair  Right  It's just the basic triangle  Right  Then there is the Mohawk  Which is the strip  The landing strip  They shave it in on the sides 
[01:57:30]  And leave just a strip down the middle  Then there's the Hitler mustache  Which is like a landing strip  Only shorter from top to bottom  Looks like a little Hitler mustache over there  Looks like Hitler  If Goebbels had punched him in the mouth  And left an open wound  Let's just say that  Knocked out all his teeth  Knocked out his teeth  Right  Turned his mouth lengthwise  And left his lips flapping in the breeze  Under that little mustache  Alright  And then  A lot of people's favorites  The clean shaved 
[01:58:00]  Wood floor  JonBenet Ramsey  Nothing down there  But also that  Because we're now doing this game in the mornings  Uh huh  It could be the 5 o'clock shadow happening  Where it is supposed to be a wood floor  But there's already some growth happening  Yeah but we gotta be clear on this one  The 5 o'clock shadow  Can't be the wood floor  That you uh  You shaved maybe the day before  Because some girls  It won't grow in  Even in a day  She'll still be clean shaven  So just because you shaved it yesterday 
[01:58:30]  Doesn't mean it's a 5 o'clock shadow  Just because it's 5 o'clock  It all depends on the nationality  That's why I was asking those questions  That's true  An Italian girl now  Could have a 70's earth mama muff  The day after she uh  She's blonde  So I'm thinking that there's gonna be  No 5 o'clock shadow today  That's true  If she was Italian  There'd be a different story  I'm thinking  Right  That's what I'm thinking about anyway  Alright are you ready to play  Yes I am  Now remember Melanie  Don't even hint to us  Or tell us  Until we ask you  What you have down there  Okay  Ready  Yes 
[01:59:00]  Let's hear up and down  Rubbing with the telephone  Okay  Oh could you  Could you go a little slower Melanie  That was a little too fast  Sorry  You hearing that oh  I'm definitely hearing that  I'm hearing something  Okay  Melanie if you will  Side to side  Very slowly  Okay  The dog's loving it 
[01:59:30]  Dog is barking  Hey speaking of the dog  Yeah  Do you have any peanut butter?  Is that the neighbor's dog?  No it's my dog  Alright  Why is he freaking out?  I don't know  What kind of dog is it?  Golden Retriever  Ah big boy  He smells breakfast  Only 10 months old  Do you have little mitts  For his front paws  For any reason?  So they don't dig into flesh?  No  Alright  Are we going to do  A circular motion now?  Yes  If you could take the phone 
[02:00:00]  And rub it in a circular motion  Okay  Yeah yeah  Alright  Alright  You got it?  I think I have a good  Good idea  What's going on down there Opie  I want to hear side to side again  You want to hear side to side?  You want to hear side to side?  Side to side  Okay  Show me side to side  Yeah yeah 
[02:00:30]  I'm going to need  An up and down also  There's something going on there  I know  There's something going on there  Are you feeling a little sensation  Today there  Melanie?  A little bit  A little bit right?  Why don't you just keep rubbing  And rubbing  And rubbing  And rubbing  And then your husband  Will have to use that phone later  And go  Ew  What's that?  It smells like something  Alright Opie 
[02:01:00]  I'm going to say  Based on the sound of the up and down  I don't usually go for this one  Because it's kind of a long shot decision  A lot of people go with the Mohawk  Which is a popular one  Or the 70's Earth Mama Muff  Or the wood floor  But I'm going to have to go with the Hitler mustache  Wow  Based on what I heard  Really?  Yeah I'm going to go for the Hitler mustache  Alright  Jim has been pretty good at this game  Jim?  You know I think I have to agree  Because I heard a little bit of a different story  Yeah there was definitely something going on 
[02:01:30]  A little speed bump sound almost  That could be something else  But yeah  Yeah that's true  It could be a wart  I heard that  I'm going with the Duff Führer  Yeah  I'm going to go with the  The lip of Duff Führer  I'm going natural here  Oh you're going with the  Like a triangle action  Earth Mama Muff  Yeah  I think it's a triangle  Alright Melanie  Yes  From Ohio  What's in your pants?  The Hitler  Yeah  Damn it  Yes  Sig Heil 
[02:02:00]  Nice  With the 5 o'clock shadow  Little 5 o'clock shadow around it  I definitely heard a variation on the up and down Opie  You could hear it went  And then it hit some rough  Hit a little rough  And then it got smooth again  Are you putting your pants back on?  Yeah  Damn it  She's a little chilly  I'm sorry  What kind of pants do you wear this morning in the morning?  Just pajama bottoms?  I have a pair of Hardwreck Cafe boxer shorts and a sweatshirt on  Oh  And my panties are just red bikinis 
[02:02:30]  Hey there you go  And your husband's still sleeping  Yeah  Wearing the same type of panties  That fruit cup you married  You really should dump them  Little visions  Little dreams of McGreevy  And a little dream bubble over his head  I could be the governor's bitch  Alright Melanie  Okay thank you guys  Hey next time when your husband's not home  You're going to do the real deal for us right?  Yeah  Alright you're going to spank that little clitty for us right? 
[02:03:00]  Possibility  Maybe Monday morning  Why Monday morning?  Cause he's got to work  He doesn't work on Fridays?

He pumps it from Lake Erie  And filters it  Oh okay  He pumps it out of Lake Erie  Sucks it in from Lake Erie  He pumps it to the water tower  That's a good way to tell if he's gay  Does he suck the hose out of Lake Erie with his mouth?  Yeah  That's a good sign if he does that  And then spits  Here's your water  I prefer to swallow  Do you really?  If it's going in  You know why hold it in your mouth and spit it out

[02:12:30]  Imagine all the people  Living life at peace  The color of girls  The color of girls  Take a walk on the wild side  Take a walk on the wild side  Imagine no possessions 
[02:13:00]  I wonder if you can  No need for grief or hunger  A brotherhood of man  Imagine all people  Sharing all the world  The color of girls 
[02:13:30]  The color of girls  Take a walk on the wild side  Take a walk on the wild side  Take a walk on the wild side  Take a walk on the wild side 
[02:14:00]  Take a walk on the wild side  Very tricky  Peace  Coming up next on Opie and Anthony  Jim Norton  Sing  Forget me not  You sightless caught  Your dog just shit on my rug  Thought that was pretty fucking funny 
[02:14:30]  Didn't you?  How's that for a sketch?  The Opie and Anthony show  You don't do sketches, stupid  I was listening to some rap music this afternoon  Not that I had a choice  It was coming out of a jeep four miles away  Yeah, can you turn that crap up?  I still have one eyeball left in the socket  It's good music  It has a message  Kill Whitey  And white people are dancing to it 
[02:15:00]  I love this song  It mentions my name twice  I like rap, man  I don't care when they mess with a turntable  Sounds like a fat chick walking in corduroy  Please welcome MC Chase  Remember they call rap  They call scratching an art form  Remember the old days  You were at a party  You bumped into the turntable 
[02:15:30]  You're an asshole  Now you're a musical genius  Is he drunk?  No, he's cutting an album  Get away from the turntable, Bill  Fuck you, I'm good  Give me a contract  Now rappers are shooting each other  Huh?  Finally  If we could just get the country and western people to join in  It'll be a perfect world 
[02:16:00]  I'd hate to see Billy Ray Cyrus take a cap in the achy breaky ass  Huh?  That would suck  Boy, we wouldn't want to lose that talent, would we?  Rappers are shooting each other  It's getting crazy  Over music, man  Remember the old days  There's a shooting  Cops used to look through mug photos  Now they look through the R&B section  And Tower Records  So, uh, what's, uh  I need a vacation  Obviously I'm a tad stressed 
[02:16:30]  And, uh  You're driving  This is your daily commute  You tune in your XM radio  You pay little attention, if any, to the road  You're approaching the Chesapeake Bay branch  Suddenly, for no apparent reason  You pull the wheel strongly to the right  Your car is pole vaulted into the air 
[02:17:00]  Gravity takes a hold  And you head to the water  The impact is like concrete  Then you slowly submerge  Feeling the cold presence of wetness  Oxygen is slowly purged from your vehicle  And for a moment you think to yourself  Man, my XM radio sounds so good

[02:19:30]  Norton is just letting them rip today  Stink bombs like I've never smelled before  Ben has left the studio  The interns have left the studio  Well, you know what he did this time?  There's a goddamn gas chamber in here  What did he do this time?  Jimmy was sitting down during the break  And he had one of the papers in his hand  Right  And he goes  He farts  And then goes  Oh, Ben  What is this story here?  And points to it  So Ben came over his shoulder  To look at what he was pointing at 
[02:20:00]  And got the full heat  Wafting up into his face  And almost vomited  I saw Ben gagging  Norton's  Out the window  Norton's jeans were like puffing out  Yeah  The hot one  Ben, you coming back in here or what?  Make him come in here  You're the boss  Come on, Ben  Put the mic  Get the mic on  What's the problem?  Get back in here and produce  Five  What happened, Ben?  What happened?  Ben's now in the  Open the window  Tell me you're here  Ben's in the fart-proof booth  I'm gonna put on a police uniform  And kick him around 
[02:20:30]  What happened, though?  Really, Ben?  Jim's a douchebag  He fucking goes  Oh, look at this  Come here  And then  Then you farted, too  So you're just as bad  Did you really?  Yeah, but  Oh, so that might have been you?  No, no, trust me  It wasn't  I know what mine smelled like  Mine was  Stop it  Mine was odorless  It's not odorless  This time around  It was odorless  It smells like rotten  Little oatmeal clumps  Little fetid oatmeal  Next time  Walk down to Steve's studio  And fart in there  I would love to  Yeah  Love to  All right 
[02:21:00]  We're trying to show everyone  We're professional broadcasters  We're not doing a good job  At all  Absolutely failing miserably  No, we're not  We're having a good time  Not in this room  No, you're having a good time  And then you leave  I had to pee  You couldn't smell your own fart?  Dude, you don't understand  I've actually held it in  Until I got under the covers before  So I can enjoy it  I've caught myself doing that  Really subtly  Like I have to fart  But I'm like  I'll be under the covers  In a few seconds  And I let it go  And then I gently lift the sheet  And it wafts up  And belts me right in the face 
[02:21:30]  I don't know why  Just smacks you  It's almost like I'm an animal  Testing to see if I'm sick  Like smelling my own waste  Bill, what's up?  Hey, Bill  Man, the phones are really slow today  A little low, too, right?  A little low  Go ahead, Bill  Morning, Owen  Morning, Jimmy  Hi, Bill  I just want to say  The satellite radio thing  Is rocking, man  Someone told me in a bar last night  Like, oh, we heard  Howard had some points  So I'm like, dude  O&A had a woman on the air  Lively  Giving a blowjob to someone 
[02:22:00]  Yeah, well, that's  For our sexiest state  In America contest  And Ohio  Has let us down so far today  Although they brought us  Melanie today  Which is cool  But there was a guy  That was waking his wife up  To have some sex  And I don't know  He hung up on us  I don't think the wife  Was into it  Going to be hard  To beat Illinois  Yeah, Illinois  Is in the lead so far  But go ahead, Bill  All right, man  I got a quick story  Despite what one  Norton told on the air  Last year with Boss  Where they had a girl  In between them  Which one?  Dude, we've had like  A bunch of those  It was the ugly girl 
[02:22:30]  Where you both were naked  She was in the middle  And you guys were  Taking turns  Whacking off  I think that story  Oh, and she  When Boss  Boss  Joked around with her  And he goes  All right, we'll flip a coin  Whoever loses  Has to fuck her  He said that right  No, not that one  Not that one  But then Boss  Was like  Oh, shut up  What kind of dog  You got there?  Not even mine  I'm dog sitting  I just got here  I don't even know  Oh, give the little fella  A little pen on his head  That'll quiet him down  You know who quiets him down?  Opie will tell you this  You gotta kick it in the liver  And within weeks  It'll be dead  Righto? 
[02:23:00]  We're not telling that story  Righto?  We're not telling that story yet  After it eats your steak  We're not telling that story yet  Right before the basketball game  What did I do to you today?  What are you talking about?  Nothing  I think Opie might have a  Knowledge on how to get rid of the  I have no idea what you're talking about  No?  No  No?  Look, man, the dog was old  Maybe Wyatt shouldn't have been  Kicked in the liver  I'm not ready to tell that story yet, Anthony  Great  Thanks to you  I had to carry that thing upstairs 
[02:23:30]  For the rest of its life  Of two weeks  I don't know what  I'm gonna go take a break  You get back here  What did I do to you today?  Nothing  You brought in donuts  I was very happy  Alright, good  Go ahead, Bill  Alright, so  No, it wasn't that story  No, it's another one  But you'll recognize it  When I tell you the end  This girl's in my room  She's awful  She's giving everyone  Like their head  She's like  She finally makes her way 
[02:24:00]  Around to me  She makes her rounds  Down the hallway  And she's like kissing me  And she's got a tongue  Like King Cooper  It's touching the back  Of my throat  I didn't want her there anymore  So I was like  How the hell can I get her out of here  And I was just thinking about you, Jimmy  And I was just like  Do you mind if I just jerk off  For a little while?  And she really wasted  And she got up  And stumbled, bummed her way out of there  It was great  Stumbled, bummed her way out of there  You stumble, bum  The worst part of that whole story  Is that she was blowing everyone  And then she came around  And kissed you  Like it was your wedding night 
[02:24:30]  Yeah  Why'd you let her kiss you?  I went to eatabullet.com  And finished myself off  There you go  I don't know any girl like that  Jim, there's a problem with your website  There's not a problem with my website  Fuck  I never worked, sir  He was trying to get me to go, what?  And he would have hung up on me  Of course he would  He was very childish  He was trying to hang up the phone  But he probably got all nervous  And he couldn't hit the button  He was bumbling  Yeah  He hit the green button  Instead of the red  You stumble, bummed  You think somebody would have just asked him  To jerk off in front of you 
[02:25:00]  Alright  We're hanging up on everybody  That wants to talk about Bush and Kerry  Why?  Because we're trying to get a couple to  You know, take out Illinois today  I still have confidence  That we'll get something going  Before the end of the show  Alright, we got the Tony Danza clips here, Anthony  Good stuff  Oh my god  I don't even know  This could be the worst show on television  I think you're both wrong, actually  I think it's a good show  Shut up  I like the guy  I think he's got pizzazz  This is what  Pizzazz?  This is what America wants to see on their TV  He has moxie and spunk 
[02:25:30]  That's what I'm trying to say  This is what America wants to see, obviously  It is?  Well, yeah  They gave him a prime slot  He's on every morning  I don't know  And the crowd seems to be enjoying the show  We watch every day after the show  To see what Tony's up to next  Yeah, we watch, alright  Another cooking segment  He was shooting baskets yesterday  He was making  With Frankie Munez  He was making meatballs the day before  And he was loading a dishwasher, I believe, on Monday  Yeah, if your talk show  Involves you and a guest 
[02:26:00]  Seeing who could load a dishwasher faster  Please  Please leave  This is what it's come down to, though  You can't do anything edgy or anything  And so you're stuck watching Tony Danza  You know, fill up a dishwasher  You're afraid to take any chances  Because of the climate out there  The FCC  So nothing can be done  Except for Tony Danza  Cooking with that worthless chef  What's his name?  Oh, that dickhead Rocco Disparito  Rocco  The chef Rocco  That had that restaurant  For the TV show that flopped 
[02:26:30]  And then he drags his  Geriatric mother out there  And Tony's got to be all nice to her  Oh, and they all cook together  Tony's helping out  Got his little Tony Danza apron on  As he, you know, stir that up a little, Tony  All right, I'm stirring  Ha ha ha ha  And the audience claps at anything  Like a bunch of sheep  It's a good show  And I think you guys are being too harsh  I think that his monologues are funny and lighthearted  Right 
[02:27:00]  He's enjoyable  I like listening to him  I think you should play some clips  Let them speak for themselves  Yeah, I think so  But first I want to say hi to John in Long Island  John, what's going on?  Nothing  How you doing, man?  Pretty good  We're all over the ball field today  What do you got for the show?  I got a recording  I was watching some porn last night  And I got a recording of this shit going down on some guy  And gagging and puking  And after listening to that one yesterday  I thought you guys would appreciate it  Yeah, the problem is  We can play these clips all day  And we're going to listen to John's today 
[02:27:30]  But we really enjoyed the live thing  Much more  Yeah, the live is great  All right, but let's hear what John has from Long Island  I don't get my head down there just yet  But when I do, I'll give you guys a point  All right, Jesus  I can drive and do it at the same time  All right, let's hear it, John  All right  Now you got to understand that  All of the crackling is slurping  It's not a bad recording  Oh, my God, okay  Good setup  Beautiful  All right  Here's John  What is that? 
[02:28:00]  It sounds like the audio from the Kennedy assassination  Yeah  From the cop's motorcycle  As they try to count the bullets  The shots, I mean  Jeez  All right, we're going to have to give up on John  Yeah, that just wasn't quite working 
[02:28:30]  Horrid  All right, it's like black box audio from a plane crash  What the?  I was trying, guys  I'm sorry  So we're talking about Tony Danza  Yeah  We noticed something as we watch the show every day  He gets cheap applause breaks  I don't think they're cheap  Oh, stop it  He is the king of the cheap applause break  When you say  For some reason  The audience is trained  To just clap at any drivel  That comes out of this guy's mouth  Angela  It's a horrible 
[02:29:00]  Horrible  Just  Just  What people think America wants  Today  So we put together  It's what we're stuck with  This is a prime example  Of what this country is stuck with  You know, the problem is this  With what you guys are saying  Like, I listen to the clips as well  And I agree  Like, I agree that they should be applauding  When they were applauding  That's why I don't think they're gratuitous  I felt that what he said was worthy of applause  You are  A liar  I'm sure you are  Are you trying to get on the Tony Danza show? 
[02:29:30]  Yeah, perhaps that's it  You know something  You can't even trash Tony Danza  If you have to sit there  And kiss his ass  Because he might be able to help you out  At some point in your career  I heard the applause breaks  And I felt that they were all  At a time that I myself  Would have applauded  All right  Well, we took his monologue yesterday  And this is all from one stupid monologue  One monologue  Two, three  And I think he has about six applause breaks here  Cheap applause breaks  Not even applause because it was a good joke  Just applause because he stated something 
[02:30:00]  But he has personality  This guy has personality  And it comes through when he talks  Do you guys have the same manager?  Let's just put it on the table  Oh  No, we don't  I just happen to think  That his personality comes through  And that just brings out a nice feeling in people  Mm-hmm  So when are you going to be on Tony's show?  I'm not  I'm probably not going to be on Tony's show  As his audience is probably not my target audience  Not your cup of tea  I just sit back and enjoy  It's not their brand of humor  Good point, Ant  That's probably a better way of putting it  Jimmy's stand-up 
[02:30:30]  All right, well  You see Jimmy going out there  And doing his act in front of those rubes  That he gets in that audience  Did you get it?  She was pregnant  She sneezed  And then there was a lump on the floor  Where are you going, folks?  All right, well  Here we go  Tony Danza getting cheap applause breaks, Anthony  Here's the first one  But I want to congratulate  The Boston Red Sox  And the Red Sox nation  I want to congratulate everyone  There it is  Huh?  Easy cheap applause break  Sometimes when you're the loser 
[02:31:00]  You have to be magnanimous  See?  If I knew what that meant  It would be even better  Riga  Shut up  But I happen to think  That the Red Sox fans  Deserve a little applause  And the fact that Tony's being magnanimous  I like it  All right, here's another one  As he tries to get a cheap applause  I'm called TiVo man  Now  I, uh, but anyway  He's talking about  But anyway  He's talking about how he TiVo's stuff  What's our applause thing, man? 
[02:31:30]  Because we could be, you know  Doing this when we're really bombing  He's like, I need a TiVo  I gotta record things  You know, so I'm TiVo man  And they applauded that  Hey guys, I'm eating oatmeal this morning  Ha ha ha  No, no, see the oatmeal's not funny  TiVo man was very funny  Why was TiVo man funny?  Because, like, the guy TiVos all the time  He's become like TiVo man  I mean, I would laugh if I heard that  Yay  What the hell is that?  That's audio from outside Fenway  It sounds like  Now, see, we need better applause 
[02:32:00]  We need better applause  We need our old applause sound clip  Yeah, the old one was great  Here's, uh, Tony Danza getting another cheap applause  So I got my tuxedo, you know  And I, uh, I had it in a bag and everything  And I, I got dressed with all my tux  And I had a fan for it pretty good  And I went to button my coat as we were leaving  And we were late  Went to button my coat  Wait, wait, wait  There's no button  No button on my tux  I'm the host  So now this is an emergency  Didn't have a black button  Right, so what are you gonna do?  Well, John was with me  So I cut one off his suit 
[02:32:30]  No, you didn't  Yeah  What a good investor  Cut a button off the suit of the producer  And he gets an applause break for that  Applause break for that  Because we can all picture ourselves in that situation  You got a thing to go to  Oh no, there's not a button on my suit  I'm gonna smack you  Why?  We really are gonna smack you  Alright, well  I relate to Tony  He's like an everyman  There's a bunch of these  Here's another one  I sewed the button on there  Boom, boom, boom  You should have seen me  I would love to have seen that  No, my mother would have been so proud of me 
[02:33:00]  So I break down, man  I go  Oh my God  Look, he talks  Oh  So crazy  I mean  Got out  He talks about how he sewed a button  Now I listened to the whole break  Believe me, I did my research  I had to sit through this  He talked about how his tux  Didn't have a button on it  So he had to sew a button on his tuxedo  And he took one from his producer  In his limo  In his limo  Moving  Took one from his producer  And sewed it on 
[02:33:30]  And as he's  Right there, that clip  As he's telling people  He sewed a button on himself  They break into applause  What?  You know who deserves applause for saying that?  Bob Dole  If Bob Dole says  I sewed a button on  Then you should clap  If that little surfer girl in Hawaii  That got her arm bitten off by the shark  She tells a little story  About how she sewed a button  On her little bikini  There you go  Or if Colby Bryan says  Hey, I had a button  But it got torn off in a rape  You'll understand how it happens 
[02:34:00]  Yeah  Colby  Yeah  There you go  Alright, that would make more sense  That deserves an applause break  Here's another Tony Danza  Cheap applause break  During his show yesterday  Oh, how about bad news?  You hear the bad news?  ABC dropped a Miss America pageant  Yeah  Pageant  All they were doing was crying on the show  They were crying all the time  The models  The models were crying?  The models were in tears  I think it's because they're starving  Oh my god  What a 
[02:34:30]  What a Rupert Pupkin delivery  But here's that  Can I get  I get very clanky  When I don't eat  Me too  The worst part of that  Is not even his awful joke  It's his awful assistant  Whatever that hole is  Who says  What, the models?  Who else could he possibly be talking about?  You trying to be a straight man  Yeah  Jimmy's back with us  Alright  You scared me for a second there  Well, I don't want to be so predictable 
[02:35:00]  Yeah  Yeah  And I'd throw up  But did you catch that  When she  He's like  Yeah  They are  Why they're so cranky  Why they're crying all the time  Who, the models?  Yeah  The models?  Yeah  This is what they want on TV  What can I tell you?  Here's another cheap applause break 
[02:35:30]  Well, I go to better hotels than you  Alright  He goes to better hotels than his hole  They're applauding hotels  Better hotels  The fact that he gets comped into better hotels  Yeah  They're applauding the fact that he gets good free stuff  What are you writing down, Steve?  You're jotting vigorously  Steve?  Uh, Jim was asking what the assistant's name is  Yes  It's Erica Vitrini from the  Yeah  Steve C, everyone  That's funny 
[02:36:00]  What?  Because they're hungry  I get cranky when I don't eat  Well, how about this?  You know what?  They're crying all the time  Who, the models?  Yeah, and I'm thinking maybe because  They were raped as teenagers  Yeah  We're going to have applause breaks on our show from now on 
[02:36:30]  We really should  Why not?  Seems to work  Oh, wow  We're going to debut the FU line finally  Three weeks into the brand new O&A show  We wanted this the first day  But three weeks later is pretty good  Yeah, we, uh, we got some calls  We farmed out some calls  Got the audio  Ben, why are you laughing?  I just love how Jim looks at Steve every day  And evaluates Steve's appearance  It's hilarious  You don't like his bowling shirt?  Kind of a bowling shirt  That awful black shirt  With the nice big white  Stripe down the side 
[02:37:00]  It's hideous  I just sit and look at Jim  Criticizing me  I know I'm awful  It's like, hello pot  I'm kettle  Kind of thing  And Jim, you wore that sweatshirt yesterday  He wears it every day  I wear it every day  I think a coat  Yeah, that's a little chilly in New York  It's cold, so I work  All right, here's, uh  Want to do just one more?  I know, I want to do a few more  And, uh, he plays a game too  Yeah, that's the last applause break  You got queued up  And then there's a game  A trivia game  With a caller from the Midwest somewhere  That's the next track  And why do we want to play that? 
[02:37:30]  I don't know  It's on there if you want to play it  Thank you, Steve  There he goes  Martini Steve, everyone  Why'd you cut your sleeves off?  Did the cufflink keep dipping into the booze  And soaking it up?  It's Friday  Steve will be drinking martinis today  He reached over his drink  And his sleeve dipped in  And that little bit of alcohol was lost  So he just tore the sleeves  On all of his shirts  Little light bulb  It was ding over his head  And he realized  I could rip these sleeves off 
[02:38:00]  And not waste any more booze  This way I won't have to  I won't have to squeeze  The shirt sleeve into my mouth  To get that drop  All right, here's the last, uh  Aww  Tony Danza applause break  For today  We'll bring this back  From time to time  I think every day  He's doing it every day  Yeah  Oh, by the way  We have Carolyn  Carolyn and George here  Yes, yes, yes  Speaking of boardroom  Wow  Not quite a cheap applause break  It's one of those  You know, announce the guest thing  I just felt like doing that  Why?  I don't know  Okay 
[02:38:30]  But speaking of boardroom  He should be talking about  His own audience  That is a  Boardroom  B-O-R-E-D though  Not B-O-A-R-D  That's fantastic  That's funny  I used to rate  Mary Lou Henner on the set  Oh, that Cody  Danny DeVito's so short  He could suck my cock  Standing up  Yeah  What? 
[02:39:00]  Oh, the music  Ah  Is that to end the bit?  No?  Okay  Back when  Back when he didn't have  So much pizzazz  As he does now  Yeah  Jesus  Hey Rock, what's up?  Yo, Rock  Hey  What's up, buddy?  Hey, this is my  Lost Boy  What?  They call me Lost Boy?  You're getting slammed

You can't send  Your fat fuck  Turd out anymore  To do your little  Bidding  Because the FCC  Is down on your ass  So you gotta sit there  And make believe  People are interested  In your drivel  In your crap 
[02:42:00]  That you put over the air  As you lose ratings  Every time the book  Comes out  You lose more and more  Listeners  Because your show  Stinks  Because you're not  You don't have the  Freedom to do  The radio  That got you ratings  Years ago  There you go  That's why he changed  The show  Have fun  Asshole  Not because he saw  The light  He had no choice  No he was forced it  He got the big FCC  Dick up his ass  And now he's gotta  Shut up  Good  Go ahead brave man  Talk about us  All you want  Give us a commercial

[02:43:00]  And come to Satellite  I do believe  Right  Right  Yeah sure  Right  Yeah  Of course you didn't  They didn't want you  Sure you did  Idiot  Him all of them  But yeah  Over and over again  He was calling our guys  To hire them  To help his stupid show  Yep  And the ratings prove  That once again  He's in 5th place  He's not going to tell  His listeners that  5th place  Howard's in like  10th place in Chicago  Good luck  Have fun  Good luck on that  Regular terrestrial radio  As it goes down the crapper  For the type of entertainment 
[02:43:30]  That Tony Danz is doing  Because that's what  It's all going to be  I'm sure it's going to  Work out for you  I'm sure there'll be  A spot for you  On satellite radio  When you fail miserably  Because you can't do  A different show  I'm sure it'll work out  It's already working out  For you now that  You've had to change your show  Oh you'll be competing  With Hannity any day now  I'm sure  Yeah because you're  Just as good as  Sean Hannity  Yeah  Don't you realize  They put you on Fox  On Fox to goof on you  You idiot  Not because you're  You're intelligent  The guy actually 
[02:44:00]  Bought into the fact  That he thinks  He's a news guy  Or something now  What does he even do  And all these radio guys  They do have  XM satellite radio  By the way  That's the only reason  He's trashing us today  Because he heard us  Trashing him  Of course they do  Yeah they're listening to us  Yep  I know for a fact  Howard has XM satellite radio  I do  Yes you do  I gotta get that turned off  Because what they do  They track me with it  Robin  They can track me  Through the satellite radio  Hey Howard  George Bush actually  Had the satellite  Reconfigured  To track me  It's actually 
[02:44:30]  A Seabreeze tracking satellite  That can hone in  On the booze  How many hours  Did you spend on that topic  Today on your show  I'm still talking about it  I'm still talking about  How Bush is my enemy  Yeah  And is trying to  Undermine me  He wants to get you  Off the radio right  That's why I'm going  To satellite radio  In when  2010  When do I go  I think when you  Turn like 55 years old  Something like that  When I get on satellite  We will all be wearing  Mylar suits  And we will be in  Outer space Robin  And we will have  Flying cars  I'll have a flying limo  That'll take me to work  Every morning 
[02:45:00]  I have my flying escalade  That I drive out  To the Hamptons in  I thought you had  The hoohoo copter  I have the  Howie copter  Every weekend  When I wing out  To the Hamptons  I take the  Howie copter  And when it lands  It sounds like this  Hoo hoo hoo  Hoo hoo  Hoo hoo  Hoo hoo  Hoo hoo  Hoo hoo  Hoo  Hoo  And I have a special  Landing port  Because I'm so tall  And gangly  Yeah  The first time  I got out  I cut my hair off  The rotor blades  So now I have to  Have a rut dug 
[02:45:30]  When I get out  So I'm a little short  Because I can't just  Duck down  Of course  I'm like the president  So why did you get  That gag order put on us  Because I had to  Shut you guys up  I always want to ask you that  Why  But why  What was the problem  We were working for  The same company  And you went to Mel  And you told them  To stop talking  You know  Make him  Make us stop talking  About you  I was very threatened  At your quick success  In New York City  Oh you're  And I  You're finally willing  To admit that right  And  This is the radio show  You don't want anyone  To listen to right  And I knew  Yes 
[02:46:00]  Absolutely  And I knew  I was getting divorced  From Allison  Allison  My best friend  And I didn't want you  Goofing on it  You know  The way I made my bones  In radio  Goofing on everyone else  Right  See I didn't want you  Doing that to me  Well a lot of people  Are calling you a hypocrite  For that  You know  There was a time  You made fun of Imus  For doing that to you  So why would you  Turn around and do that  You know  Anthony and I  I don't know  I was wrong  You were wrong  I'm admitting that  You're finally admitting that  I'm admitting that  Not only that  I'm a hypocrite  But I'm also an asshole  Confession's good for the soul 
[02:46:30]  Robin  You're hoping that  People don't see you  Right through that lie  Right  Yeah absolutely  I'm hoping they don't see it  Alright  Hoo hoo hoo hoo  Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo  Hoo hoo hoo hoo  Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo  Hoo hoo hoo hoo  Well there you have it  And I didn't want you  Talking about my daughter  So I had to gag you  Oh she's got  Really big  Fat Jewish tits  Hoo hoo hoo  You got big tans honey  Who are you?

[02:47:30]  Jesus  That's why I called her honey  Ow  Boo that's kind of  That's kind of brutal  I'm feeling bad  Oh Jimmy how you doing  Fine thanks  How are you?  Where'd you go?  Right here  He runs away  Having some water  Yeah I see that  So we're done with  Tony Danza?  Oh we are?  I think so  I'd like to hear the other clip  That's just me  You know it's funny  The um  I think the producers  And the network  Said the same thing  So we're done with  Tony Danza  I hope so soon anyway 
[02:48:00]  I think this show's gonna  Oh it's gonna be a hit?  It's gonna be a hit for a while  They  I don't know  I don't get it  But those shows work real well  Yeah  Oh yeah  Hmm  All right  You wanna just take a break  Black Earl  Why is he calling?  Just thought we'd get some feedback about baseball from Earl  Earl?  Oh Earl  The very big Yankee fan  What's up Earl?  What's up bro?  How about those Yankees huh?  Oh we stunk up the joint  What are you gonna tell?  The worst collapse in Major League Baseball history 
[02:48:30]  Well I don't know about that but  Yeah it is Earl  Earl it absolutely is the worst collapse in baseball history  I'm not saying it's not one of the worst  Is it the worst?  It is the worst  First time it's ever happened  It's history making  They're gonna be talking about the only time it's ever happened  And guess what?  It's gonna say New York Yankees  Right  I'm telling you I think this was worse than Bill Buckner  No  I don't  In the overall scheme of things 
[02:49:00]  Wait a minute  I think  Okay hold on  I think this is worse than the ball going through Bill Buckner's leg  No no no  No you know why?  That was a single moment that can be shown over and over again  This wasn't a single  Any single moment  This was the whole series  And well the last four games  And it wasn't a World Series  No  No it wasn't a World Series  We're talking about  We're talking about the greatest choke in sports history  You're right  I'm telling you this could be worse than Bill Buckner  No it's not  Dude you guys were up three zipping you  It's a horrible choke 
[02:49:30]  We're not talking about one play  We're talking about a sporting event in general  But it's not  It's a horrible choke  But it doesn't have the implications  Because first of all  This Yankee team has won World Series before  And it sucks  You're right  It stinks  But Buckner  Dude  Was on a team that hadn't won since 1918  And it was right there  And it's just one of those  It's a one moment  They had it won  They had it won  It's a one moment thing  There's 50 moments on this dumb Yankee team  You've also got to remember  The Red Sox in games 6 and 7 of that series  Had three run leads  And bloomed both late 
[02:50:00]  I still  They won the games though  They lost both games  Oh what did you say  Oh never mind  Yeah okay  They had three run leads  Both times in the 7th inning  I don't know man  I think this is right up there  With the Bill Buckner play  I don't know  You guys this was brutal  It never happened before  In baseball  It never happened before  In basketball  The only sport that happened  Was in hockey I believe  This doesn't hurt  Like the Bill Buckner thing did  This sucks  But I mean like  Ah we won in 2098  I mean it stinks  But at least you have that 
[02:50:30]  With Buckner  It was like  That was the one moment  In this empty field  Of no championships  Right  And I might even shit on the Red Sox  By saying that  I'm just saying  That's why that's a bigger moment  Yeah the Buckner thing  Is a bigger moment  This was one of the biggest  Chokes  One of the biggest  Collapses  In baseball history  But that Buckner moment  Is just classic  As a Yankee fan  This one doesn't even bother me  As bad as the 2001 World Series  That to me  Because those three comeback wins  At the stadium  With the ninth  And two out home runs  And it was the World Series  This wasn't the World Series 
[02:51:00]  I'm dating myself  But I remember when I was 11  It's the only one you are dating  Jackass  Dating yourself every night  And they blew it to the Dodgers  That was horrible  Because they lost that game  Nine to three  And I had to see  Fat Tom Lasorda  Run under the field  At Yankee Stadium  Hugging and kissing everybody  Was that 79?  81  All right  All right  But to me that was worse  Because I absolutely  I cannot stand Lasorda  But 
[02:51:30]  It's right up there  This is a bad one  It's a real bad one  It's been in mourning  It's a real bad one  One thing about the Yankees though  If they come back  We will be back  Well Steinbrenner will make changes  Hopefully he'll dump  As a matter of fact  I wonder if there's a top  Well it's funny you would say that  Jim  Look at you the sigmeister  In the New York Post today  Here in New York  There's the top ten things  The boss will do in the off season  Anthony  This is the worst  Yeah yeah yeah  You need the  Oh man  You need the 
[02:52:00]  Look look  No  They made a top ten list  Of things  Yeah  Yeah  Okay  All right  Because these  Because these are so funny  They only have the ones  Someone  Well that's the only one we need  We'll fill in the blanks  I mean  This guy who writes for the Post  He's a comedian  Steve Serby  I think he's going to be  At the Comedy Cellar this weekend  You're a funny dude man  Top ten things the boss will do  In the off season  Start with ten  Okay  Listen for the humor  Number ten  Buy the Red Sox  If you can't beat them

[02:53:00]  Get a part on NBC's  New weight loss reality show  Yeah  Yeah  You know what was another  Great weight loss show  Philadelphia  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  You  Weight loss won't help the team  You silly ghost  You kook  Oh cut it out Steve 
[02:53:30]  That was not supposed to help  I don't know  They're too fat to win  That's goofy  Oh boy  This guy  Oh my  Go ahead  Go ahead  No  Number eight  Number eight  Number eight  Top ten things the boss will do in the offseason  To make the Yankees better  Show up at the World Series on Fireman Ed's shoulders  And lead Fenway in a chant of  S-A-W-X  Sox  Sox  Sox  Yeah  Oh god  That is so funny  Oh  You have to show up on Fireman Ed's shoulders  Because if you show up on the shoulders of a 13 year old sofa 
[02:54:00]  You're going to fall off one side  Chance Sox until you get shot in the eye by a cop  Oh gosh  Oh gosh  Those cops are very incorrigible  Oh boy  Incorrigible  I know you're happy  Have a pellet in the eye  Whore  Oh  We need this guy to write for our radio show  Good gravy 
[02:54:30]  Steve you're a nut  Geez  Number seven  Join the hunt for Osama Bin Laden  And take Cashman with you  Oh  Over to Afghanistan  Right  Oh boy  Oh  Oh  Oh my  Let's catch our breath here  Wow  These are some real rib ticklers  Or maybe have Pedro and Curt Schilling kidnapped by Tawid and Jihad  And have their heads cut off on video  Oh  Give me these crickets  Oh  Yeah  Oh boy  Oh that little Middle East tie in 
[02:55:00]  This guy is  Oh man  He's a scream  Oh  Steve you're a panic  You're  Number six  We're only to number six  Oh  Many more  Plan a photographer to catch you dirty dancing with Jenna Bush  Oh  God  He brought in the politics into it because it's the elections coming up  What  She's been a little bit of a nut  Kind of like you know when she's been out and about  Yeah  You know  Yeah  Wow that one was  What  That was good  He's hysterical 
[02:55:30]  Top ten things the boss will do in the offseason to make the New York Yankees better  Number five  At least  One thousand nine hundred and eighteen times a day  Ask your sons  Who's your daddy  That's funny  That is dope  Wow  And maybe the sons will say  How do you know who your daddy is  Cause your mama told you so  Yeah  Yeah 
[02:56:00]  Who's your daddy  Ask your kids that  That's great  And then all the Puerto Rican kids will go  We have no idea  Yeah  Yeah  Of course  Wow  That is great  I love this guy  He's so funny  I love this guy  Top ten things the boss will do in the offseason to make the New York Yankees better  Number four  To change the culture of joylessness around the club  Film a celebration video with Terrell Owens  Oh  Because he always jumps around when he wins  That's pretty funny 
[02:56:30]  That's not bad  I think that's pretty funny  You guys didn't like that one  But I think that's pretty funny  Yeah  He celebrates  What?  When he wins  Like when Terrell Owens scores like a touchdown  He kind of celebrates  And that picks up the mood  Hey man  That one wasn't funny  So we can do that  I thought it was pretty good  So one out of ten  You know  No I disagree  I think we don't have a sense of humor  Because I didn't find it funny  Because I didn't find it funny either  But obviously it's got to be funny  I know  Because the rest of these are just a scream  A celebration video  A celebration  Did he actually hand this in to his boss and say  Hey I want to print this 
[02:57:00]  Dude you can't stop now  There's three more  All right number three  Steve Serby  This is how the boss is going to make the Yankees better in the offseason  Oh number three  We're almost done  No  I wish it was 20  Send out a memo  Demanding that all employees  From Joe Torion down  You ready for this?  Yeah  Grow their hair like Johnny David  In time for spring training  That's funny 
[02:57:30]  Unless of course one of them has cancer  Then he won't be able to  Or unless of course  They're married to Scott Peterson  Don't want to grow one of those hairs  Might be found in the boat  Wouldn't it be really funny  If he said grow their hair like Christopher Reeve  Because he didn't  You know  No they would just grow this little headphone thing on their head 
[02:58:00]  Oh my god  All right  Like a bunch of pieces of wax fruit with Yankee hats  Number two  Wow  Oh boy  Do we have to do more?  Come on  You can't leave people hanging  All right  Number two  People are going to call  But say they almost drove off the side of the road  When they heard this one  Top ten things the boss will do in the offseason  To make the New York Yankees  Yeah  Number two  Oh brother  Make an appearance on The Apprentice  And ask pal Donald Trump to 
[02:58:30]  Fire you  You're fired  Oh that's funny  That's right  You take pop culture  A popular television show  Yeah yeah  And you bring it in  Like good thing this wasn't in the early 80s  He would have said  You call your friend Hawkeye Pierce  And tell him to operate  On a five year old Korean  Who's had shrapnel in their stomach  Whatever TV show is popular 
[02:59:00]  That works with  Oh  Oh boy  Why don't you use  You're the weakest link  Goodbye  Oh that's a good one too  I love a catchphrase on a show  Yankee fans can end their sorrow  By putting their face through a windshield  Like Billy Martin  Yeah  Of course they could  Old Yankee reference  Or maybe  You want to put a smile on your face  Fly your own plane back from Canton  Or catch a disease that they're going to name after you 
[02:59:30]  That is funny  Or maybe you can beat your wife and then sponsor a coffee maker  You know  Little silly thing  Yeah  Or maybe you can get pulled over in the Lincoln Tunnel with some coke  All right 
[03:00:00]  The number one thing the boss will do in the offseason  To make the New York Yankees better  Are you guys ready?  Yeah  Hire Martha  Martha  Martha  Hire Martha Stewart  Make jello shots out of the mixed liver  No  Hire Martha Stewart for the front office  Once she leaves Camp Cupcake  There's no better time to be  Father Flanagan  What? 
[03:00:30]  That's exactly what it says  Father Flanagan  That's exactly  Look  Oh oh oh  Because Father Flanagan  Boys Town  Remember Boys Town  He would take  Boys that were in trouble  Like convicts and stuff like that  And then show them a better way  And a new life  After they were in trouble  In prison and stuff  So you know  It would be like a Father Flanagan thing to do  To have her come out  Holy shit this guy is the worst 
[03:01:00]  It's always good when you have to explain it  Right right  How about something kind of like this  Like you can have your seven year old son's trousers pulled off  And he'll be abused by Father Flanagan  And then the Boston Archdiocese will cover it up and go bankrupt  Paying off the lawsuit  I can't believe you pulled that one off  This guy did scream  Brilliant  I give you props today my friend 
[03:01:30]  What a scream  I didn't think you were going to pull that one out  Nice  Alright well  I'm just laughing  Steve Serby  Get your post subscriptions now  That guy is a hoot  That wasn't even buried  That was right there  So what's it going to be at the Hammerstein  You  The Steve Serby  The Voss  It's called The Passion of Serby  It's going to be  The Opie and Anthony guys are hosting  You know  What's that  The 13th  Get your tickets now  Ticketmaster  Rich Voss  Myself 
[03:02:00]  Jim Brewer  And then Steve Serby is going to come out  And read his top ten lists  And he's got a bevy of them  Oh it's a scream  Hey Phil what's up  Yeah  Anywhere to get rid of that canned laugh  For years that  Oh yeah  It's pretty hard to get to a laugh  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  What was he saying 
[03:02:30]  You mean that one  He's kidding right  I  I  I don't know  Some people don't get it  Got it recorded  Alright Earl  You got anything else  Pretty good appearance on the radio show by the way  Not bad Earl  Not bad  Some of the old characters making a comeback the last couple days  Starker Patty was really good  Surprise  Patty came on and actually was good  And Black Earl  Pretty good today  Two people of the same ilk  We replaced our Frenchie 
[03:03:00]  Two virgins back to back  Oh look at that  Hey  Stalker Patty is a 49 year old virgin  And Earl is a 34  That's right  34 year old virgin  The only difference is one is black and one works at any W  We were  We replaced Frenchie  Because Frenchie's appearance blew  So we replaced him with a new Frenchie  Who yesterday had a great appearance  As he bashed Stalker Patty  Yeah  So we just traded it off 
[03:03:30]  Like Darren Stevens on Bewitched  When they traded him  And just brought in a new guy  And just name him Frenchie  And it seems to be working for us  Alright Earl  Oh god  I never last a hard  In a week  Alright relax  I never last a hard in two weeks  Alright let's kind of  Well you went from never to two weeks  You really have a very inconsistent timetable  Earl  Who's going to win the World Series?  Who will win the World Series?  Yeah well what do you think is going to  What?  St. Louis Court  St. Lou  Well what do you think is going to be the deciding factor?  Um  I love that 
[03:04:00]  He was gearing up to really belt out a few suggestions  You think he's still talking?  Yeah he is  Thinking he's on the air?  Yeah  And then it's like  Pausing and thinking we're all listening  Then he waits after he's done  Hello?  Oh god damn it  Let me go into the office  What?  God damn  What?  Is anybody calling in?  Hmm?  Oh yeah  No I missed  I was wondering if anybody was calling  No  No one's on the phone to do the silent game with Jimmy  But that's why I pointed  I didn't want anybody  He's now calling me on my cell phone 
[03:04:30]  No  Oh yeah  Take the call live in the air  You bastard  Yes Earl  You hung up on me  You bastards  Of course he says  You bastards  You got anything else to say Earl?  What?  He has what?  What?  What?  Hmm?  I'll call you later  Alright  What are you and Ope doing later?

[03:11:00]  Till you were on XM  Okay  Which I'm a big fan now  Isn't it amazing  That  How much this would suck  If it was Opie and Andy  I would be the worst  It's like  The Opie just  The Mayberry show  You know  And a lot of people  Like to abuse me for my name  Trust me  I know it stinks  But you can't change it now  I got stuck with his name  When I was 12  You're sucked into it  Yeah  Wow that's weird  How long have you been  Listening to the show  Um  Since we started  Since we started  And you  And you've heard  Opie  Talk to Jimmy Norton 
[03:11:30]  Right  Uh huh  And he goes  Hey Jim  Right  Uh huh  And you've heard him  Talk to me  Uh huh  And what does he call me  When he's talking to me  Um  Apple  Well sometimes  Yeah sometimes  When he brings up dead dogs  Yeah  He calls me what  Anthony  Very good  Okay  So now  What would you assume  The name of the show was  Um  Let's see  Opening and Anthony  They say that one too  Some people do say that too 
[03:12:00]  The opening and  Opening and Anthony show  Okay  Yeah  Alright Susan  What do you like about the show so far  Okay  I have a question about  What's in my pants  Okay  A question  Okay  What is the most popular  Shave  And what do you prefer  Uh  Wood floor  Very good  Yeah well  Wood floor  That's very good  If  If the package looks good  Wood floor is clean shaven  Okay  Clean shaven  Not a hair to be found down there 
[03:12:30]  But that's only good  If the goods  Are in good shape  Yeah wood floor  If you don't have a clef  Or a dimple  Yeah  You see  You know what you need  You need hair down there  If it's going to camouflage a mess  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  You know  Okay  But if it's all nice  And looks all purdy  Then we want to see it  So shave all that off  That's right  Okay  And the  The like  The mohawk  That's very popular  With strippers  I think a lot of girls 
[03:13:00]  Do it  During the summer  They don't want bikini line  They don't want that hair  Hanging out of the side  So I think the most popular one  Is the mohawk  Because a lot of girls  Kind of shave it down the side  Okay  But wood floor  Close second  That's my favorite  And Susan  What do you got  What do I got  Oh I don't know  What you would call it  I guess  A mess  Yeah  A penis  Beirut  Does it look like  You're making  Jiffy Pop popcorn  In your panties  I personally don't like hair 
[03:13:30]  A little  As little hair as possible  So what  Did you shave it  Wood floor  Oh  You're a wood floor  Alright  You're happening  Somehow it doesn't sound hot  Huh  No  Can we ask what you look like  Not to be creepy  But we always like to ask  The gals that call in  Yeah so we have a mental image  How fat are you  What do I look like  Yeah  Okay  I'm athletic  I ride horses every day  Oh boy  Big thighs  About 5'2", 120 pounds  Okay  And um  Um  What can I say

[03:14:30]  Oh man  See you gotta give me signals  Oh it's alright  It happens  A little miscommunication  No harm  No foul  You set her up perfectly  And I thought I would  Help you out there  Jason from Orlando  What's up Jason  What up guys  How are you  Hey Jace  Just chillin  I just turned y'all on yesterday  And y'all are pretty fucked up  Man I dig this shit  Thank you  Yeah  Alright  I used to listen to the monsters  And I was like  What the hell  I heard about y'all guys  And never heard y'all before  But heard about you  From  I guess y'all were from New York 
[03:15:00]  And y'all got fired for  Somebody  Y'all had somebody  Fuck somebody  In a church  Well that's pretty good  You pretty much have the facts down  Is that what it was  It's like we got a little bit  Of a reputation out there  Yeah  That's what happened  Some people say that happened  Sure  Even down there  In the Disney capital of Florida  I dig your show man  Y'all are  Y'all are pretty funny  Hey are the monsters  Are the midday still on  Yeah yeah  They're still on  I'm not gonna listen to them no more  Of course  This show is way more fucked up  Than theirs 
[03:15:30]  This is just the one big commercial  After another  There you go  They don't really hear  Many commercials on our show  No  None at all  And y'all don't really promote gigs  And all they do is promote gig  After gig  After gig  And their show gets kind of dull  This shit's fucked up  I was listening to that  I guess that guy was calling him  To the bar  Right  That shit was funny  Two bar  I heard that on Howard Stern  A long time ago  And they used all the bleeps  Yeah  Well Howard will be able to play that same bit 
[03:16:00]  In about 15 months  Right  Without the bleeps  Dude nobody wants to hear too many plugs  I mean like you know  We're here to do a radio show  Do you think everybody out there cares  That I'm gonna be in Sacramento  At the punchline November 5th and 6th  Who gives a shit  So why say it right  That's  You know  Me at the punchline in Sacramento  November 5th and 6th  There's so many more important things to talk about  Like eatabullet.com  No I don't care about eatabullet.com  I figure if I pay two bucks  I wanna fucking laugh  I don't give a fuck  Where you're gonna be tomorrow 
[03:16:30]  Good point fella  Alright Jason  Spread the virus for us  Okay  Do me one favor  What cuddles  Why don't you get some whore  Into your studio  And have her shit on the plate  And put it in the microwave  And put that on the air  I want shit like that dude  I want some fucked up shit  You know  I think we might take that  Alright  The only problem  We don't have a microwave in here  But just shitting on the plate  We could probably arrange  Do that  And then have her roll around  And then screaming  Donkey sausage  Donkey sausage  Shit like that 
[03:17:00]  You know  Make me laugh  Yeah but sir  How many times has that been done  And a chick was shitting a plate  Running around yelling  Donkey sausage  We want something different  Why do you wanna hear  Why do you wanna hear that  I don't know  Just some shit  I ain't never heard before  This is a new wave of radio man  Talk with me  This is XM radio  I wanna hear some fucked up shit  I haven't heard that before  That's for sure  Alright people man  Peace out  Do your show  Make me laugh man  Alright I like you Jason  You're alright  You call back anytime  Alrighty thanks  Bye fella  Ben write that down 
[03:17:30]  We need to get a girl in here  To shit on a plate  And then we're gonna put it  In a microwave  And we need a microwave  She's gotta roll in it  To yell donkey sausage  Run around yelling  Donkey sausage  That's great  That's gotta be a promo  I have no idea  What that's all about  I want that to happen  Bokey and Anthony's  Hot Teen News  Really  Another hot teen news story today  We are really trying  To get away from this bit  For a while  And rest it  But every freaking day  In the paper  There's another teen story  Anthony  Well the papers understand  How hot teen news is 
[03:18:00]  And we're trying to filter  Through all these stories  And only give you  The best ones  And we gotta do  The hot teen news  Again today  Hot teen news  FBI web sting  Bags Brooklyn perv  With lewd list  Uh oh  A Brooklyn man  Was busted yesterday  For using the popular  Craigslist website  Oh that's one of  Jimmy's favorites  Yeah we're gonna have to  Talk about Craigslist  In a minute here  Yeah  To entice  Underage girls  Have sex with him  Authorities said  Gregory Swalice  27 was arrested  By FBI agents 
[03:18:30]  Yesterday morning  In front of a firehouse  On Liberty Street  Where he allegedly  Expected to meet  A 13 year old girl  Oh you idiot  That's a 13 year old girl  And pay her  We could have saved him  If he was listening  To our show the other day  Yeah he obviously  Doesn't have the  X-Men Solid Radio  We saved a few guys  From doing this same thing  Uh to meet a 13 year old girl  And pay her $200 for sex  But the girl did not exist  Of course she didn't  She was an FBI agent  Who posed as the teen  After reading Swellice's posting  In the erotic services section  Of Craigslist.com  Any high school girls here 
[03:19:00]  Is what he wrote  Any high school girls here  Well 13 year olds  Aren't high school  How did he get roped into that  Well he said  You could get an 18 year old  High school girl  He started  Be a little stupid  He started a little high  You know  Oh is that what he did  Yeah and then he writes  If you're a hot high school girl  Wanting to make a lot of extra cash  Let me know  The posting read  Please send a picture  Or description  This guy provided  His email address  That allowed the FBI agent  To track emails  Going to and from his office  Where he worked  Uh the agent set up 
[03:19:30]  This thing on Wednesday  By emailing him  That she was a 13 year old girl  Who needed help  Yeah  This guy answers  I prefer younger ones  Younger than  Well than high school  I think he was just  Making a statement  Because he found out  This one was 13  So he's like  I prefer younger ones  Right  Okay  He wrote back  Uh nonetheless  This guy asked for a picture  And the agent sent one  Of an adolescent girl  Oh boy  This guy then asked  If his email companion  Was prepared to meet  And asked how much  The girl would charge  For FS 
[03:20:00]  Uh full service  Oh full service  Okay  I'm learning Jimmy  I'm learning  Uh yeah  And it says that  Web shorthand  For full service  Or sexual intercourse  He offered $200  $200  Uh he also asked  Whether the agent  Knew any other  High school girls  Who would be willing  To engage in sexual intercourse  With him  He was charged  With soliciting sex  From a minor  Once again  You know  I understand these guys  Uh you know  They deserve what they get  But isn't it 
[03:20:30]  Doesn't it seem  A little bit like entrapment  You know  If the girl  Is kind of saying  She's 13  Well no no  Originally he was asking  For a high school girl  Right  So that's the legal age  Right  What's the legal age  In New York  Where's our website  Is it 18  No it is 18  But it's 18  And it's odd that  You know  If there was never  A 13 year old girl involved  There really wasn't  They're portraying it  As if she was 13  But there's no real  13 year old  So how can you then  Charge him 
[03:21:00]  I know  With it  If he was talking  To somebody  That isn't even 13  I think  That's probably the defense  That all these guys  Jump on  All their lawyers  Jump on and stuff  I understand the guy  Is you know  A predator  And should be convicted  To the fullest extent  Of the law  But it seems like  There's a little loophole there  It is  A tight little loophole  Yeah he should be  A tight wispy haired loophole  He should be  He should be convicted  Of murder  In his fatherance  Of theft  Son  He  Technically there's no 
[03:21:30]  It's almost like  On the internet  They said that  Kitty porn  That you  Isn't real kitty porn  Like a lot of these guys  Will put like  Little kids faces  Or they manipulate  Real pictures  And the Supreme Court  Is like that's not illegal  Even though it looks  Like a naked  You take a little  Kid's head  And put it on  A regular girl's body  Or something  Yeah there was  Some kind of  A weird case like that  That the Supreme Court  Got  You know everything  About this stuff  He certainly does  He's got to keep  Himself safe  But even though  This should be illegal  Though  That just seems like  Something that  There's no  13 year old girl  Involved  So where's the crime  It's intent 
[03:22:00]  I guess a certain  Intentive  Soliciting  Yeah  He is attempting  Reaching out  Looking for a 13 year old  Is the crime  I guess  Yeah  Alright let's say  Hi to  Raquel  Raquel  That would be me  Hi  Do you want to  Shit on a plate for us  And then run around  Saying what  Donkey sausage  Donkey sausage  Donkey sausage  We'll microwave it  If you give us  The proper amount of time  Nice  New Jimmy Dean's  Donkey sausage  Raquel can you do us a favor  Just run around your room  Really fast  Just yelling  Donkey sausage  Donkey sausage 
[03:22:30]  I want to see if  This has potential  To spit  Sounds like  Yeah  I can do that  I can do that  Run around and say  Donkey sausage  Yell it though  Yell it  And yell it all silly  Okay  Go ahead  Alright hold on one second  This is what this guy  In Orlando wants to hear  Donkey sausage  Donkey sausage  Donkey sausage  I like it  There might be something there  There's something oddly  Attractive about that  That kid wasn't  Whistling Dixie  You want to hear  Something really funny  Alright  It is that I'm  Running around  In my store  Radio Shack 
[03:23:00]  And we're open  So there's customers  In the store  Oh my god  We ought to sell them  Donkey sausage  It's probably better  Than the rest of those  Shitty products  Everything I ever bought  From Radio Shack  Broke  At least the donkey sausage  You can put on your chest  And whack off  Under a glass table with  Yeah I'm not a big fan  Of the Radio Shack  Myself  It stinks  Oh boy  I really am not  Let me cross that  Potential client off the list  Radio Shack  We've got answers  The question is  Why does everything you sell  Suck  You've got questions  I hope that was 
[03:23:30]  You make some real bad  Decisions about the  Merchandise you sell  Wait that doesn't  Wait that doesn't  That doesn't  I could get a Dell  Computer but I want  A Tandy 80  For me  You may have questions  I don't always have  The god damn answer  That's a good point  Ah that's a good  Are you working at  Radio Shack in New York  No in Jersey  Oh alright  I grew up in Jersey  So  There's a little  Radio Shack in Jersey  You know what  Not all the Radio Shacks  In Jersey are bad  No  So you come into mine  You actually get a good time 
[03:24:00]  Yeah  That's right  Cause I've got you guys  Pumping in the background  You know  So how many  How many XM radios  Have you sold  Out of Radio Shack  Well we  We don't have XM yet  Yeah no shit  I know  You guys sell  You sell the little  Doggy units  No shit  Crap Howard Stern is on  Well  Not yet honey  Not yet  You made a great decision  Sure  Hey did you see  That terrible commercial  On the game last night  For the other company  With the dog  In the back seat of the car  Horrid  No  What was it  For serious  What was the commercial  There's a dog  Riding in the back 
[03:24:30]  Of the car  Driving around New York  Wow that's pretty cool  Like I was watching  A ball game last night  Like I cared about  Watching baseball last night  Well Ben  What'd the little doggy do  I don't know  He's just barking  Oh  I get it  You know what  The mistake Howard made  Thinking he's bigger  Than this whole  Satellite radio thing  He's just not  When the consumer  Goes to the best buy  In the circuit cities  They're gonna make  Their decision  On the choices  And it's not gonna  Come down to one thing  You know  XM satellite radio  Signing Major League Baseball  Is huge  And then you add it  To everything else 
[03:25:00]  They're doing  And it just makes  Your decision  That much more obvious  Well you know  What really bugs me  About the serious thing  Is that  They play the same  Crap  Over and over  And over again  It's no different  Than god damn  Regular radio  There you go  There you go  Not to mention  The satellite unit  That you get  From Sirius  Looks like an x-ray  Machine  Up on your  Dashboard  They look like  A tampon box  They are awful  Aren't they  All right  So what do you  Want to do today  Raquel  Well what I told them 
[03:25:30]  Is I'd be willing  To play  What's in my pants  And trust me  What's in my pants  Is damn sexy  Why do you say that  Because I'm  Fucking hot  Is it a realistic  900 channel scanner  For 99.95  No  Realistic  I love that  No one carry realistic  I know  The old days  I'm talking about  The old days  Actually that's when  I used to play  You guys in the store  Was in the old days  They used to just sell  Now Radio Shack  Has been trying  To get other products  Outside products 
[03:26:00]  Into the store  Because their own  Products were such  Crap  If you remember  The ancient days  When the Commodore 64  Was out  That computer  The Atari 800  Radio Shack  Had the Tandy  Computer line  I have  I have  I have pictures  Of these things  And commercials  Of the old computers  Yeah  People on TV  In their old 80's outfits  That look like  They should belong  In the fucking zoo  Or something  It was the TRS-80 
[03:26:30]  That's the computer  That Radio Shack sold  And it was so  You could do nothing  With it  There were no games  You could play on it  Nothing  It was the worst  Piece of crap  And they sold this stuff  You know  Well into the time  Where other places  Were selling good computers  And then they finally  Realized maybe we ought  To sell some  Hewlett Packers  Or something  Maybe we should  Get with the times  So people stop  Returning the shit  That they buy from us  Not a big fan  Of the Radio Shack  No  Everything breaks  Maybe if you came  Into my Radio Shack 
[03:27:00]  You'd change your mind  You know what Radio Shack  Was good for  If you wanted to  Like once I decided  I had a schematic  To solder together  A stun gun  And I built a stun gun  And I hit my girlfriend  With it  Good boy  To see if it worked  She was pissed  But I assumed  It wasn't going to work  Because I made it  You know  I soldered it all together  But if you're going to  Get electronic stuff  There you go to Radio Shack  If you want to buy  Stuff that's built  Ugh  No we've got cool stuff now  No you don't  Oh you walk into there  On Christmas  And they got those  Cheap radio controlled

[03:46:00]  Limping to the finish line of another week of fine radio programming here on XM Satellite Radio  Here we are  Week three just about complete  Feeling good  Week three complete?  This is our third week I said  Are you sure?  We've done three weeks  We haven't done two?  Huh?  This isn't our second week complete?  It's our third week?  Third week already  Wow  Already  Yes  That went quick  I thought it was two  You kidding? 
[03:46:30]  No really  It really shouldn't count the first week  So it's technically two  Yeah  You want to play  What did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  We'll start with that  Huh?  What?  The Eminem Michael Jackson videos on  It's hilarious  Very very funny man  He's just killing Michael Jackson  The figure's awful BET takes it off the air  Do they really?  Of course they did  He's a white performer  Right  And they have to defend Michael Jackson  Because of his race  Yeah  And no other reason  Ugh 
[03:47:00]  Fucking revolting  They would never come to the defense of any white artist  By banning videos  I don't really get the BET thing  They stink  And if a black guy was trashing a white guy  And if MTV yanked it off  They'd be screaming racism in a second  But why is it allowed to  A black network to be allowed to broadcast?  That's very racist  Aren't the black people trying to get away from that whole racist thing?  Well people like to believe  They want to be quote equal  And thought about as equals and stuff 
[03:47:30]  But then they shove a black network at us on TV  I don't get that  Because people only use mentioning their race  When it's advantageous to them  They don't want complete  People want separation when it's their advantage  Right  You can't join this country club  You're a racist  Well this is black entertainment television  That's acceptable  Right  It's just the way it works  Yeah  It's the way it works  Oh this video's great  Yeah I love that  Bravo to VH1  Erica Strada making an appearance  Right there  Stupid BET  From Chips  Alright we're watching TV again

Hey how you doing?  Okay I learned two things today  I learned that Bush performed an abortion the other day 
[03:49:00]  To win over some Democratic voters  And I learned that there are two Opie's in this country  One's Norton's friend  And one is a gay water maker from Ohio  Yeah  Water maker  Yeah we'll get an update  I think her name was Melanie, right?  Oh yeah, okay  Very sexually frustrated in Ohio  Let's say hi to El Paso, Texas  Jay, what's up?

[03:49:30]  Hey you like that girl?  No, we're on the fence with her  Oh, she's great  She sounded really hot and stuff, but I don't know  Had to crank up the radio so I could hear her  But I'll tell you what, made a believer out of me  She ran around her story where she works yelling donkey sausage  And she wanted to do the wiffle ball bat  What do you want from that poor girl?  No, we're talking about the whole orgasm  Yeah, her orgasm was a little, you know  I'll agree, but I'll bet you if she was alone and could do it  She wanted to please the show  But I'll bet you if she was alone she would have done it  Alright  And not at work  Okay, let's say hi to Steve in PA 
[03:50:00]  Hey Steve  Hey guys  Hey  Hey, today I learned that a plate of hot steamy shit is more better than Radio Shack  Yeah  Hmm  Okay  Hey Jimmy  Not going to work, fella, ever  I'm too good  He gets all mad  Bye, fella  Doughboy from whackbag.com  I learned we need a politician in a top hat to tell us that we're going to hold down the colors  Gee  I think it was supposed to be hose, but it does say hold  Henchman from Brooklyn  Today I learned wood floor is the best style if there's not a cleft or a dimple 
[03:50:30]  F-serious  And he's one of the whackbag members  Today I learned a good clit is about the size of Voss' thumb  Hey, that's good  Another one from Henchman from Brooklyn  Today I learned Stern's daughter has a wide ass and big, fat, juicy Jewish tits  Yes  Wow, we are limping to the finish line today  Oh, I don't agree with that  I think it's a fine finish  Look, we're faking it, but we're limping  I'm not limping  Jeff from Jersey, what's up?  What's up, you sexy bastards? 
[03:51:00]  Hi  I learned that Radio Shack in Central Jersey hires the most unsexy, awful fucking bitches  Dude, I disagree  A lot of guys weren't digging  He didn't like her  A lot of guys weren't digging that  She was awful  I'm sexy, I'm the best girl ever  I'm going to the jail  Look, I'm hot, I'm hot  Look at my vagina  Awful  I think she'll come in and do the Liverpool all bad challenge  Well, you're sticking her ass, I don't care about that  Alright, thank you  You're giving that gal a hard time and I don't like it  I'm with Jeff  You're not, I like it  Well, we'll see  We'll give her another chance 
[03:51:30]  Daryl from Westbury, I learned that there now is a fishing department in Radio Shack  Cool  Don't forget to  Alan from Sacramento  Yeah, I learned today that Philadelphia is a diet plan  Donkey sausage, always funny  And I can see Jim Norton on November 5th and 6th at the punchline in Sacramento  Good boy  Wow, look at him go  Bravo  Nice plug  Tennessee James checking in  What's up, James?  I learned that Frenchy is the only one that I know of that can take two fists in the ass 
[03:52:00]  He's probably taking it by a great big Hitler youth guy  Wasn't that like yesterday's show or something?  It certainly was  Okay  Are we on a time delay?  I think they're in a different time zone over there  We are  All right, thanks James  See ya  You just liked that from the other day, I think  Yeah  Can't see  Gabe from California  What's up, Gabe?  How you doing?  Pretty good  I learned that Bill O'Reilly should come on the show and do the wiffle ball bat challenge  Well, we have heard stories of vibrators in the ass 
[03:52:30]  Uh-huh  Mm-hmm  That guy hasn't missed a vibrator since the eighth grade picnic  They are really trying to undermine that girl's credibility  The one that's bringing the case against Bill O'Reilly for the sexual harassment  She's, uh, a hundred grand in debt, they said  But, like, $65,000 of that is student loans  So, who didn't, you know, you had a lot of student loans out, didn't you?  Oh, my God, ridiculous  And then another, I think, $30,000 in credit card debt  Which, you know, I was pretty close to that, too 
[03:53:00]  It's not like you're in a few million dollars debt ready to lose your business  So, they're claiming, uh, that's why she's doing this?  Yeah, that was her motive  And some people actually hinting that there might be some kind of settlement talks in the works  Yeah  Uh, and, what is this, the Enquirer?  Yeah  Is reporting that a sex claims forced O'Reilly to attempt deal with accuser  Two more women may come forward  So, both sides have their, their stories  Um, I, I was saying, I, I think women are gonna come forward with this one 
[03:53:30]  Because even if it's true or not true  Uh, people see an opportunity to make some cash  So, you'll probably see more women coming out with more fun stories about Bill O'Reilly  How much time do we have?  What's that?  Four minutes  That's plenty of time  Four minutes to self-destruct  I got a track from, uh, Demand World we're gonna play  And then we're gonna wrap up  Wow  Oh, yeah, dude  What do you got?
