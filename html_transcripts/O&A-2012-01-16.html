FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  What's going on?  Are we there?  Yeah, we're really, of course.  That's the angry baby in Oslo. 
[00:00:30]  You ever been to Oslo?  Yeah.  Absolutely.  He's probably sold it out nine million times.  Doing Anomaly?  Yeah.  All right.  Not promoting the book.  It's been a couple years, right?  Yeah.  Things haven't changed much.  No.  Believe me.  Same shit.  Yeah.  For Jimmy's birthday, we had you to surprise Jimmy.  Yeah, you brought me a cake.  It was a girl's ass with a log of shit coming out of it.  Yeah, I remember that. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  It was slightly obscene.  Yeah, it was great.  Are we in the air right now?  Yeah, yeah.  That's how we roll.  We've got to get that montage together of people.  We absolutely have to.  Every guest that has said that to us.  We don't know if that's good or bad when guests ask that.  Is this live right now?  Yeah.  Are we on the air?  Do you guys consider this entertaining?  Is basically what they're saying.  Real professional.  Me?  Yeah.  Do you have, what kind of information do you have?  Oh, well, right now on Amazon, the book, it's number one in biographies for composers 
[00:01:30]  and musicians.  It's already number one in entertainment music and it's number four in books, biographies  and entertainers.  And it's in the top 100.  And it just came out yesterday.  There you go.  It's great.  Go figure.  I'm almost finished with it.  I've probably got like 20 pages left.  It's fucking, you did a great job, man.  Thanks.  It's, this is something I wanted to ask you.  The opening line of the book, you write, when I was a kid, I used to carry this awful  image around in my head, a picture of three men tangled awkwardly in high tension wire, 
[00:02:00]  50 feet in the air, their lifeless bodies crisping in the midday sun.  Why?  Why?  Well, you know, my dad helped build the installation, the electrical installation for West Point.  And, oh, you didn't read the book then.  No, I, well, I, no, I got to the opening line and I just got bored and I closed it.  No, that wasn't, I just, I just, you know, I don't want to just say it because then if  I just say it.  Yeah, my dad was working with other guys installing the new electrical installation at West Point. 
[00:02:30]  He went, he'd draw a short, a short straw to go get the sandwiches.  He came back and his buddies, you know, got electrocuted because somebody inadvertently  had flipped the switch.  Wow.  So basically, if he had not drawn the short straw.  They became crispy critters, you know.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was terrible.  So if he hadn't done that, literally he might have been up there and he would have been no  you.  If he wouldn't have drawn the short straw, I would have been a bright idea, I guess only.  Wow.  Are you, uh, are you doing book signings or no? 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, I'm doing one at Barnes & Noble here in town tomorrow.  What is your relationship now with, uh, like Gene and Paul?  Because I think you were pretty fair in the book.  Like, you slam a little bit, but not, it doesn't seem bitter.  It seems like it's a pretty honest assessment of what happened.  Well, you know, there's good and bad in every relationship, just like a marriage.  So, uh, yeah.  I mean, I had lunch with Gene about, you know, four or five weeks ago.  Did you pay?  We just hung out and, uh, reminisced. 
[00:03:30]  Uh, did you see what he said about me, uh, on page six the other day?  I heard audio.  Is that the audio where he said that you were saluting him like Hitler?  I just heard that.  I don't know if that's old audio or is that new?  No, I was on page six the other day in the New York Post and they, people, whoever wrote  the article was quoting parts of the book where I'm talking about Gene and giving everybody  crabs.  Yeah.  This, that, and the other thing.  And then they got a statement from Gene.  Nobody has it yet. 
[00:04:00]  Where is that?  Uh, we're not, we're not a prepared radio show.  He said something to, he said something to the effect that.  Sam will find it.  Uh, brilliant.  Ace has been an alcoholic and a drug addict for 35 years, but we love him, you know?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you didn't say there's decades of your life that you don't remember or something?  Yeah, probably.  That's why I needed help on the book.  But, you know, the 35 years, it's incorrect.  It's incorrect.  It's a false statement.  I've been an alcoholic for at least 40 years.  And, um, you know, proud of it. 
[00:04:30]  But, recovering at this juncture, you know, five years plus.  Oh, good, good, good.  Yeah.  I celebrated five years on September 15th.  Oh, that's great.  Any urges at all?  Any urges at all?  Because I, I, I, I'm so, occasionally I get them.  Yeah, the first couple of years are the hardest and then I, subsequently every year after  that gets easier and easier.  Now, you know, people drinking in front of me doesn't even bother me.  Do you have any vices?  Any vices?  Yeah.  Well, you know, I grew up, most of my life was sex, sex, drugs, and rock and roll.  So, you take away the drugs, you still have rock and roll and sex. 
[00:05:00]  Two out of three ain't bad, right?  Like, like Meat Loaf said.  You, uh, there's quite a few fucking near misses in this book, too.  Fucking hilarious.  Electrocutions, you know, um, human sacrifices.  No, with drugs.  Like, there's a couple of times where you, uh, the one I just read was really interesting.  You were flying into a foreign country and you had an eight ball in your sneaker.  No.  And it seems like you got these really weird premonitions at times where shit was about  to go really bad for you.  Yeah.  And, uh, what happened on the plane that you just felt something might be wrong when you 
[00:05:30]  landed?  I just had a premonition, man.  I was going to get popped, you know, if I landed with that stuff on my body.  So, I went into the, uh, laboratory and flushed it down the toilet, which became a little  bit of a problem.  We needed that, Ace.  Oh, yeah.  Good, fellas.  I need, ah, man.  Kevin.  You know, you know, I'm struggling with my addiction and, yeah, should I do it?  Should I not do it?  You know, what's worse, going to jail or getting high for a weekend?  Right.  But, uh, you know. 
[00:06:00]  You didn't do a little bit of it and then flush the rest of it?  No.  No.  I was already so wired just from the dream and the premonition.  I had, like, a nightmare on the plane.  Um, I was just, uh, having to get rid of it and get back to my seat before.  Oh, is that what's parking?  Because the plane was about to land.  That's got to be the most paranoid feeling you could have to be flying on a plane to another  country high out of your mind with drugs on you.  Yeah, yeah.  How do you, how do you hold that together?  Yeah.  More importantly, did they check you when you got off the plane?  Yeah, well, when I got off the plane, you know, uh, one of those, uh, drug sniffing 
[00:06:30]  dogs actually.  So, the premonition was true.  And they examined my shoes and everything.  And then I started panicking.  Man, was there a second one in there?  Somewhere hidden that I had forgotten about, but, uh, wow.  Sure, muleed it up your ass.  Yeah.  I never went that far.  That's how I smuggle fruits and stuff, too.  There you go.  At some point, you gotta be like, all right, you got me.  Fruits.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  You can't bring fruits and vegetables across the international waters.  Unless I'm thinking something else. 
[00:07:00]  But I can.  With those double entendre stuff.  Did it, uh, when you, you talk a lot about the drug use, too.  And when you were in Kiss, like, how, people would have thought that Gene and Paul were  drinkers back in those days.  You would have had no idea that there was such a difference between you and Peter and  Gene and Paul.  Um, how far into Kiss did that start to become, like, an issue or talked about or, or some  sort of a point of strain?  Well, me and Peter both started spinning out of control, you know, once, once we all became  millionaires, you know, too much, too soon.  You know, like so many other rock stars, you know, in history.  But, you know, I mean, I'm just lucky that, I mean, every day above ground, you know, I'm 
[00:07:30]  happy for, you know, because by all rights, I shouldn't even be here.  What's the craziest thing you went out and bought when you were at the height and you  had all that money?  Craziest thing?  That you look back now and go, what the fuck?  Really?  Why did I do that?  I mean, I was buying, you know what I used to do?  I used, when I was a kid growing up in the Bronx, I never, you know, my parents were,  like, middle class, but we couldn't afford, you know, expensive toys and gadgets.  So I would always go to hobby shops and buy the most expensive radio-controlled helicopter, 
[00:08:00]  the most expensive radio-controlled boat.  I hear you.  And airplanes and all sorts, you know, I mean, spend thousands and thousands of dollars  Put eight balls in them and then you're flying into another kind of thing.  Yeah, and most of them are just sitting in my storeroom, you know?  So just weird, like, shit that you would have wanted as a child you bought as an adult.  Yeah, stuff I never could have and I wanted, you know, hey, now I can get it, you know?  And, of course, a lot of sports cars and, you know, some clothes and...  Did you trash a few cars due to maybe drinking? 
[00:08:30]  Several, yeah.  I mean, God, my DeLorean, I cracked up a 928 Porsche.  Did the DeLorean come with cocaine with it?  Yeah.  That was such a cool car.  I remember I used to go pick up my daughter at preschool, you know,  and all the kids would come running out to meet the car.  The spaceship is here, you know?  The spaceship.  Yeah, because, you know, the gull-wing doors and, you know...  Maybe it was because of the driver.  And the funny thing about that car, that's the only car you don't wax with, like, car wax. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, stainless steel.  You have steel wool polish.  Yeah, it's like stainless steel.  It was nuts.  So, I was also enjoying reading the Phantom of the Park story and how much that you thought  it was like a whole goof and how Gene was, like, genuinely embarrassed by that because  you thought it was going to be, like, a legit...  Well, yeah.  Holy shit, really?  I mean, the whole movie to me was kind of a goof, but the whole kiss phenomena was a goof. 
[00:09:30]  I never took it that seriously.  You know, Gene always took everything so goddamn seriously because he wasn't loaded.  And, you know, he was always thinking about money and this and that.  And, you know, what else can we merchandise and, you know...  And, you know, that completely went off the charts and it completely went out of control.  You see, once Kiss got really big, Gene started, in conjunction with our management, started, 
[00:10:00]  you know, over-merchandising the band to the point where, you know, little kids were showing  up at the show.  And I talk about it in the book.  Yeah.  And, you know, all of a sudden, you know, my road manager's going, hey, it's cool with  the, you know, the F-words tonight because there's a lot of little kids in the front row.  You know?  You know, that's not what rock and roll's all about.  Yeah, and you felt...  I know you talked a lot about how you felt the merchandising went way too far.  What was the first thing you saw that you were like...  Because, like, t-shirts, there were some publicity stunts where the mayor would wear makeup.  Like, that stuff made sense. 
[00:10:30]  But what was the first thing you saw that you were like, ugh, what the fuck?  Well, you know, the dolls were kind of cool.  Yeah.  You know, but...  Action figures.  The commercials showed them little kids with them.  And, you know, the lunchboxes, you know, but who walks around with a lunchbox except  the little kids?  I did.  I mean, there were...  I've seen a lot of grown men running around with kids like Fox.  Sure did.  But, you know, it just got completely out of control.  And, uh...  And it annoyed you?  Anything that's been produced, you know, merchandise-wise, there's usually a kiss stamp on it. 
[00:11:00]  I mean, it's crazy.  Do you think that...  Because you also...  You stress in the book a lot about how you felt that the music really took a backseat  always to the money and to the merchandising and to the show.  And how long into it did that start to bother you?  Like, I think the music is suffering.  Wait.  I can't tell you how many times the following day after a concert, you know, I'd look up a  review in the local paper and it would talk about the show more than the music.  The music did take a second, you know. 
[00:11:30]  It was a second in a lot of people's minds because the show was so elaborate, you know.  But for me, you know, I love the show and I love coming up with, you know, I'm the wizard  when it comes to guitar effects, you know, the smoking guitar, the rocket guitar, the  light guitar, you name it, I've done it.  But, uh...  It should never, you know, come before the music.  To me, the music was always the most important thing, you know.  And the fact that it was choreographed, I was surprised, too, that you, uh...  It bored you, you said, after a while, because of all the fire and the flash pots that you 
[00:12:00]  couldn't move around on the stage.  Look, you know, I just did two nights at B.B.  King's, you know, and we switched a few things around.  Couldn't do that in a KISS show.  Everything had to go, you know, because, you know, everybody, you know, the pyro guy's  got a board and he's got the song list.  And if we do a different song and he presses the button, you know, somebody's going to get  blown up.  It was that crazy.  It was like a Broadway show.  That's fucking scary.  You had to count on that guy.  I mean, we brought in our own elaborate stage and we brought in our own lights. 
[00:12:30]  We brought in our own pyrotechnics.  And, you know, we had seven tractor trailers at one point.  Wait, that happened to Hetfield at one time when he was playing guitar and that whole thing  came up, burned up his hand.  I got electrocuted on stage in 1976 in Lakeland, Florida.  I was just talking to the interviewer I did, I was with last night over at VH1, and he  said there is some type of video footage of me getting electrocuted, but they're still  trying to get a hold of this.  How did you get electrocuted? 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, what's the story?  Well, it was before wireless transmitters.  So, I don't know if you remember the set we used to have where it was like five marshals,  you know, 25 feet high, and we'd come down a staircase.  Well, you know, here I am in platform shoes, so I always have to hold on to the railing.  I grabbed the railing, and I wasn't grounded properly, and I got zapped with 220 volts.  Holy shit.  The only thing that saved my life was I got thrown back onto the platform. 
[00:13:30]  If I would have gone forward, you know, I would have probably smashed, you know, cracked my  head open.  How long before people didn't realize that that wasn't part of the show?  You know what I mean?  Because you guys got so many, like, things, you know, you get zapped and get thrown back.  It took a while for the guys in the band to realize I wasn't even there, you know, because  everybody's doing their own thing, you know?  And, you know, Gene's preoccupied with sticking his tongue out at the girl in the front row,  you know, and Paul's dancing around, you know, and flipping it, you know.  And finally they go, you know, they're looking around and going, where's Ace, you know? 
[00:14:00]  And so they had to stop the show, and then I had burns on my fingers.  You know, I was actually knocked out for several seconds.  I was going to say, yeah, were you, how soon did you come, too?  God damn.  I think I was, I took about a five-minute break, and then, you know, I managed to pull up  and he says, Ace, you got to get back out there.  And all of a sudden the fans and the whole venue started chanting, we won Ace, we won Ace.  So my adrenaline started pumping, brought me back to life. 
[00:14:30]  So you just shook off being electrocuted, and it's unbelievable.  I mean, I fell the other night at B.B. King's, you know, because there was no luminous tape  on the edge of the stage.  I'm doing my smoke montage.  Oh, shit.  I'm going like this, and I'm walking to the right, and my right foot goes into the hole  where the monitor board is, and I thought I broke my leg.  Then I looked at my guitar after the show.  I had snapped off the Tune-O-Matic bridge, and what had happened,  the guitar took the brunt of the fall. 
[00:15:00]  Jesus.  If the guitar wouldn't have done it, I would have broke my leg, and I, you know, I don't  know what.  Did you keep playing, or did you stop the solo?  No, I jumped back up and switched guitars and finished the solo.  Is that embarrassing when that happens?  I've never fallen on stage.  That's probably, well, I've fallen a lot with Kiss, but it was like on the stage, not off.  I've never fallen off the stage.  That was the first time.  It was a little scary.  Why would you fall on the stage?  Were you ever under the influence?  Oh, I used to fall all the time with those boots.  I mean, those platforms.  I could never, you know, Paul and Jean are pretty good with those. 
[00:15:30]  I was never good with them.  What's the most you fell in one show?  And did you start getting mad?  These motherfuckers with these boots.  I don't think I've fallen more than twice in one show, but that's enough.  Yeah.  Did it cause resentment with the other members who came up with the idea for the boots?  You know, they got used to it.  In fact, if I would fall, they would try to make it look like it was part of the show,  and they'd like, come over to me and play to me until I, you know, match it.  That's awesome.  Get back up.  Oh, man.  Yeah, you gotta keep the rock and roll going.  In those days, we all covered each other, you know. 
[00:16:00]  It's not like every man for himself, you know, towards the end.  What's the craziest thing you ever saw looking out into the crowd?  All your maniac fans that even you for half a second had to step back like, am I really looking at that shit?  It was a lot of crazy shit, you know.  I mean, I remember the last reunion tour, you know, some Oriental broad was following us around, you know.  She'd pull off her panties and write on them, fuck me ace, you know, and hold them up.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah, that's right.  Did you fuck her?  Yeah, did you make her dreams come true?  No, no, no, no. 
[00:16:30]  Was she attractive?  She was a bad looking.  If she was hotter, would you have fucked her?  Huh?  Would you have fucked her if she was more attractive?  I'm kind of passed out these days.  Oh, was that recently that happened?  That was in the Kishri Unitor, probably around 2000.  How long did it take you to get that out of your system, where somebody held up panties and said,  fuck me ace, that you didn't give in to that temptation?  How many decades?  A lot of the insanity with women kind of went along with the drinking and the drugging. 
[00:17:00]  And, you know, once I got away from that, I got away from the...  The groupie thing?  The insane behavior.  But, yeah, you know, I also vividly remember, you know, in the 70s, we used to get shots  of penicillin like once a month, because the worst thing you could get was like syphilis  or something, or gonorrhea, you know?  But, I mean, I remember when the AIDS scare came in, and we all kind of were a lot more cautious.  Except for Gene.  Oh, yeah?  He just kept fucking?  Oh, well, yeah. 
[00:17:30]  Gene has two prerequisites for a woman, alive and breathing.  You know, it's just like, so, uh...  What was the crab story, because you guys all got crabs?  Yeah.  Because I've had them three times.  I got them twice from the same girl, and then once, I think her girlfriend cheated and gave  them to me.  They're fucking horrible.  Well, you know, in the old days, Sean Delaney used to pack our leather jumpsuits in one  trunk, throw it, you know, throw it in the truck, and, you know, move on to the next  show.  Oh, God.  You know, Gene was infested with them, and the little buggers jumped from one costume to the 
[00:18:00]  other, next thing you know, all four of us are scratching, you know, and everybody goes,  Gene!  You know, but Gene came to kiss the crabs.  You ever have them on stage?  Didn't you guys have the shaved pube show after that time?  I can't remember the name of that stuff we have to apply.  RID.  RID was what I used.  R-I-D, yeah.  Oh, God, it was that little comb?  Yeah, it was terrible.  I used to have, I have straight pubes, like a Chinese person's hair, I have awful pubes,  so I fucking, I finally shaved them completely now, but it was fucking terrible. 
[00:18:30]  It's a violating feeling when I had an itch, and then you look down, and you pull this black  thing out, and you see leg, it's fucking terrible.  It's creepy.  Yeah.  You know, you gotta, you know, you gotta boil all your sheets, and it's crazy.  How many times did you have them?  Would you have them more than once?  I may have had them twice in my life, you know, but Gene was pretty much infested for  several years during that period.  I love infestation.  He had infestation.  He should have been condemned by the Board of Health. 
[00:19:00]  He should have put a sign on, a quarantine on his door.  Are you happy he's married?  Am I happy?  Yeah.  Yeah, when I had lunch with him, I was saying, Gene's going, Ace, you know, I'm gonna tie  the knot.  It's about time, Gene.  And, you know, I mean, Shannon's a great lady, and, you know, she stayed with him all  these years, and gave him two beautiful children, you know.  I think he did the right thing.  When you left, it was, you just really wanted out.  I was surprised to read that.  I thought, for some reason, I thought they asked you to leave.  I didn't realize that Peter had already left, and you absolutely, they almost begged you 
[00:19:30]  to stay in the band, and you just didn't want to anymore.  They both asked me to stay, you know.  But, you know, between all the drugs I was doing, I was living in isolation in this big  mansion in Connecticut with a recording studio, and, you know.  In my mind, you know, if I didn't get away from the band, I was gonna die.  And, you know, it was a tape that kept playing over and over in my head.  You know, I'm sitting in my lawyer's office, and I'm going, I gotta leave the band. 
[00:20:00]  I'm gonna die.  I'm gonna kill myself.  And he's going, yeah, but it's $15 million, Ace, you know, buys a lot of therapy.  I said, therapy doesn't work when you're six feet under, you know.  I don't want a dirt nap, you know.  And so you guys had made a lot of money, but then you had this other contract where  it was gonna be $15 million apiece, and you knowingly just said, I can't do it.  No, it's a $15 million record contract for the four of us.  And I ended up walking out, and it was actually cut in half because of me.  I don't think they ever forgave me for that. 
[00:20:30]  Oh, they lost $7.5 million?  Oh, I bet Gene wasn't happy.  In the 70s, you know how much money that is?  Fuck yeah.  That's a lot of money.  Sorry, guys.  Why did Peter leave?  Peter was fired.  Why did, what was ultimately?  You know, Peter ran into the same problems I did eventually, you know, with abuse.  And he had a car accident, and, you know, it affected his playing.  Were you there when he got fired?  Did you guys all sit down, or was it a...  Well, I actually didn't want Peter fired, you know. 
[00:21:00]  I figured, you know, let's put him in the hospital and get him cleaned up and give him another chance.  But Paul and Gene were pretty adamant that, you know, they didn't want to give him another chance,  and they just wanted to move on.  So I was pretty much outvoted, so I had to go along with it.  How's he doing now?  Peter's doing okay.  You know, I spoke to him not that long ago.  I saw him at Bill O'Coin's funeral down in Florida.  And he sang it, and I heard he's working on a book also.  Is he still partying?  Is he still performing?  No partying.  Is he still partying, or is he... 
[00:21:30]  Oh, I don't think so.  I don't think so.  Got shit together.  Good.  Yeah, I always found it interesting, because it's like, you guys put out so many...  so much material in the first few years of your existence.  Most bands put out an album in a couple years later.  And you pumped out, what was it, three...  How many albums in the first 18 months?  Up to 11.  Four albums.  Wow.  In eight...  Four albums, three studios.  That does not happen anymore.  Yeah, I'm sitting with my ghostwriter, and he's telling me...  He's giving me these statistics, because he did his homework, you know?  I mean, so many people know more about Kiss than I do, because I live there, but I forget. 
[00:22:00]  I forget the numbers and the dates.  He says, man, you did four albums in 18 months, and between those albums, you're touring extensively.  He goes, that must have been insane.  It was.  It was just like this rollercoaster ride that never ended.  Well, your first three records, too, they weren't selling...  I mean, they were okay, but you said Casablanca almost went broke, because you guys just weren't  selling records until live.  I mean, we came out with Kiss, then we came out with Hotter Than Hell, and then we came  out with Dress to Kill. 
[00:22:30]  And after Dress to Kill, you know, things were shaky.  You know, I know Bill O'Coin had extended himself, and Neil Bogart had, you know, put a  lot of their own personal money into the band.  And if a live wouldn't have taken off like it did, and become, you know, a huge record,  you know, who knows what would have happened.  Why do you think bands take so long today to, like, you know, we had Tony Iommi recently,  and he talked about Black Sabbath, the record, and that took, like, I think, two days in the  studio or one day.  And I know your first album, especially, didn't take... 
[00:23:00]  Why do bands obsessively take a year now, whereas back then you could do it in a week  or two months or whatever?  I don't know.  You know, it has a lot to do with the producer, you know?  Sometimes, you know, in the old days, the band used to get together and just knock it  out, you know?  Now, you know, you get the producers that bring in there and go, okay, we'll do your part  today, and then tomorrow we have Johnny in the studio, and then we have, you know, Bubby  in the studio, you know, because they're making more money, you know?  They're getting a piece of the studio, they're charging a larger fee, and, you know, we did 
[00:23:30]  it old school back in those days.  It's been four days getting a snare drum sound.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I remember walking in the studio at, like, nine o'clock in the morning, and we're still  working on drums, they just come back after lunch, you know?  You know, they're trying to get the perfect drum sound on it, you know, get every ring  out of every...  It's nothing worse than sitting there and just listening to it.  Doosh, doosh, doosh, doosh, doosh.  Yeah, yeah.  No, they...  Oh, God, shut up.  Nothing worse than a drum check.  Now everything's canned. 
[00:24:00]  You know, you can get samples and get perfect drum sound, you know?  You know, a lot of people today, when they record an album with drums, they end up replacing  the drums with sampled sounds, you know?  They just trigger them.  I bet...  I'm not sure about this, but I bet in the old days, too, you could just write some songs,  throw them on an album, put the album out, and then, you know, you write some more songs,  put it on an album.  And now it seems to me like the record company probably has some kind of say, like, oh, you  know, we need more hits, or we need a little more of this.  And they're probably more selective as to what they want you to put out as a band than 
[00:24:30]  in the old days.  Yeah, it depends on the type of group.  If you're a single-orientated band, absolutely.  You know, if you're...  But how many album-oriented bands are there out there now?  You know, Kiss was always...  We always made more money at live performances, and we really weren't a single-orientated band  until Rock and Roll Night, you know, and Beth and stuff like that started happening.  You know, but...  Yeah, it was all about the live show.  Yeah.  That's for sure.  Yeah, I think that's why a live, you know, took off like a bat out of hell, because it 
[00:25:00]  was the perfect souvenir for a Kiss concert.  Okay, why did you guys decide to take the makeup off the first time, and how scared were  you, like...  Well, I wasn't there.  Oh, you weren't there?  I quit the group in 82, and then the guys decided to get...  What did they get?  Vinnie Vincent?  Vinnie Vincent.  Well, for a while, Vinnie had some kind of onk on his head or something, an Egyptian  thing, and then they decided to take it off, and then, you know, they had a...  Did you think, did you think looking outside that that was a mistake, when they were going 
[00:25:30]  to take the makeup off, like they were killing a major hook?  No, well, I took my makeup off and started, you know, Pirelli's Comet, you know, and that  did well.  I had a gold album, the first out of the box.  But, you know, also, you know, after I had left Kiss, you know, it wasn't the...  With complete creative control and freedom, it wasn't, you know, the ideal situation either,  because everything was on me.  You know, when I was in Kiss, I could lean on those other guys, because they were workaholics.  And then I realized, well, it's up to me.  If this record sucks, it's because... 
[00:26:00]  They're going to say it sucks.  So, you know, it wasn't the dream that I had imagined while I was still in the band,  but, you know...  You're like, I don't get to wear that stupid makeup.  The makeup became a real drag.  I mean, imagine having a hangover, and then having, getting a phone call at 8 o'clock in  the morning and say, you got to go to a radio station promotion, and you got it in full  costume, you know?  Ugh.  Yeah, that...  I mean, it's not even for a show.  It's like... 
[00:26:30]  It was a nightmare.  Did you half-ass it sometimes?  Just fucking like, eh, fuck it.  Just one star.  I was coming up with all kind of crazy ideas.  I said, could we get stencils or something?  Can we just raise the shit on?  And, you know, it was just like, God, I got to do this again?  You know, I talk about it in the book where I'm doing the film.  You know, I'd show up on set while we were doing Kiss meets the Phantom of the Park,  and, you know, I'd get into my trailer, get into makeup, and, you know, the director would  say, hey, we're going to do close-ups on Gene today. 
[00:27:00]  We don't need you till 1 o'clock.  You know, and I'd flip out, you know?  You'd sit there in the fucking makeup, yeah.  But then you took off and fucking went to a King Tut exhibit and then came back and apologized.  Yeah, that was the most bizarre thing.  I was like all bent out of shape because it happened more than once, and I lost my temper  with the producer and director.  I took off, lost my bodyguards, you know, zigzagging through traffic, and then I just said,  I ended up at the La Brea Tar Pits and a museum there, and I've always been fascinated with  the Egyptian culture, you know, the pyramids, the whole nine yards, and I'm standing outside 
[00:27:30]  going, wow, this would have been a great thing to see, and some broad just comes up to me  and hands me a ticket.  He goes, you need a ticket?  You look like you need a ticket.  I said, yeah.  I go, how much?  He goes, oh, you can have it.  It was insane.  You know, most of my life seems like a dream.  It's a fantasy.  I don't know.  I bet.  Just weird stuff that just, when I read it, I read it cover to cover when I got the final  version, and I said, wow, what a great movie.  Yeah. 
[00:28:00]  Who would you want to play you?  Play me?  I don't know.  Probably somebody who looks a little like me.  Yeah, I guess that would help.  We'll have to find something.  We'll have to find, maybe we can get Scorsese to do it, huh?  The book is called No Regrets, too, and it's fantastic.  I just wish I had finished it.  I'm like 30 pages short.  I'm a twat.  What did you think of the pictures?  They were great.  They were really great.  A lot of them nobody's seen.  I like a lot of the young photos.  You're a handsome guy, and I like some of the fucking outfits that you had on in the  70s. 
[00:28:30]  And two things, too.  I want to say, you said you and Gene were roommates at one point, and that you think  Paul was happy that he was with you, and that you said he was disgusting.  You said Gene Simmons in the hotels was disgusting as a roommate.  Dirty.  Like, why was he dirty?  I'm surprised to read that.  Why?  Like, what did they do that was dirty?  You've got to ask him, you know.  I mean, Shannon's nickname for Gene used to be stinky.  Would he really spit on the floor, though?  You said he was just hawking loogies on the floor.  Yeah. 
[00:29:00]  Well, you know why?  He spit on his own floor.  You know why?  Because whenever he breathed fire, he'd be drinking kerosene, and a lot of times he would  swallow some of it.  Oh, so he's constantly trying to, after a show, he's coughing it up, you know.  Yeah, you're out on the crabs.  You're in a holiday inn, you know, I'm jumping over crabs, and, you know, blobs, and this  and that, and, you know.  It was all in good fun.  Where's, uh...  Yeah, when he burned his pubes up, is that what he did?  He quit Cassie's knees.  Yeah, he was just spit the fire on the... 
[00:29:30]  Gene's head went on fire a couple of times.  Did you laugh, or were you worried?  No, I was worried.  Okay.  I was, I was, you know...  Did you laugh afterwards, though?  Well, you know, after we knew it was okay, we thought it was a stir.  Of course.  Yeah.  You know, Sean Delaney attacks him with a towel, you know, and ends up rubbing off half  his makeup.  Who was Sean Delaney?  Sean Delaney was our tour manager in the early days.  And he was responsible for a lot of the choreography in the beginning.  You know, he worked with us, you know, with our moves, you know. 
[00:30:00]  The classic Kiss moves, like you see.  A lot of them were Sean Delaney's ideas.  Okay, you wouldn't have thought to do that.  He said, why don't you guys walk up at the end of the song and all do this or do that?  Yeah.  Sean was very instrumental with that.  What's the best band that ever opened up for you?  Were you actually standing, even at the height of yours, going, oh, my God?  The best band, I don't know.  You know, we've had Rush open for us.  We've had...  Back in the day, they were like unknown.  Bob Seger.  Well, they were known, but, you know, it seemed like every group who were open for a Kiss  tour, after that tour, they ended up headlining because they had gotten so much, you know, 
[00:30:30]  exposure.  Because all we were playing was arenas.  Yeah, I remember Bob, after the tour, Bob Seger gave me, you know, a gold record, you  know, and a thank you.  Oh, for giving him the shot.  Yeah.  You know, you open up, look how many people you're exposed to.  In those days, you know, it wasn't MTV, it wasn't the internet.  So, you know, playing before a live audience was one of the best ways to get known.  Do you have information on your signings, too?  Because I want to plug the signings before we wrap, because... 
[00:31:00]  On my signings?  Yeah.  Do you have any...  Is there a website that they can go to?  Yeah.  Go to AceFreely.com.  AceFreely.com.  It's F-R-E-H-L-E-Y.  I fucking have not been able to spell your name for 30 years.  It's German.  Freely.  I always spell it wrong.  Everyone says it wrong.  It's Freely, but it's Freely.  I would have said...  Ace Freely.  Freely admits that Freely is the proper pronunciation.  It is Freely?  Freely, yeah.  That's so odd, because no one is going to say Freely.  No one is ever saying Freely.  Everyone says Freely.  Listen to the live record. 
[00:31:30]  Paul Stanley goes, Ace Freely, lead guitar.  I probably think he's saying it wrong.  Oh, did he say it right?  Why did he say it like that?  Pretty much.  Oh, fuck.  I didn't know that.  Freely.  Ace Freely.  Are you going to change your pronunciation, Jim?  No.  I'm not.  No.  I'm just happy you say my name.  You can mispronounce it.  You know?  It works.  Well, the book is great.  Go to AceFreely.com.  See, I just fucking have a chance.  I just changed.  Nice.  That sounded good.  Yeah.  And get information on the signings, because I'm sure the signings will be mobbed. 
[00:32:00]  And it's genuinely a great book, man.  And again, I learned a lot about it.  I thought I knew everything about Kiss, because I've been a fan since I was just a boy.  Some people were saying to me the other night, man, you've been in a lot of fights, they  said to me.  And I go, you know, I'm from the Bronx, you know?  I'm a Taurus, you know?  Give me a stage where this bull can rage.  If you...  I'm not...  How's that thing?  Give me a stage where this bull here can rage.  Although I can fight.  Although I can fight, I'm much rather a sight.  That's entertainment. 
[00:32:30]  What are you going to do?  How great is it?  Just doing raging bull lines with Ace, there really is nothing better than that.  You should just hang out and do them all day.  That's just my fantasy.  I've never hung out with De Niro.  There's one guy I've always wanted to hang out with.  Have you met him?  Maybe.  You know, I've met so many people in those 30 or 54 years.  It's just like, a lot of it's a blur.  I'm dancing with Lindsey Wagner.  I'm hanging out with John Belushi.  You know, the Stones.  Alice Cooper.  So how many times does that happen to you when somebody just comes up to you like, hey!  And you've got to be like, hey! 
[00:33:00]  I don't remember you.  I have no clue.  I'm good at that.  You know?  We're not remembering people's names.  I go, how you been, man?  Long time no see.  What are you up to?  You know?  I don't know who it is.  Yeah.  But, you know.  You can't go over the years.  You get good at that.  All the fans.  That's all you've got to do.  Just walk up to Ace.  Act like you met him before.  Actually shit the shit without hanging out and talking to you.  Yeah, dude.  You invited me to your house.  All right.  Let's go.  All right.  Cool.  I finally got time in my schedule.  All right, man.  I said, give me a call.  Give me a call.  Did you really remember my shit cake? 
[00:33:30]  Yes, I did.  Okay, good.  Yeah, I remember being here.  That'll make Jimmy very happy.  I had a video camera going.  Yeah.  Were you licking it or sitting in it?  I ate the log.  You were doing something obscene with it, weren't you?  Yeah, there was a little shit log and I felt obligated to eat it out of respect for the chef.  You know, all these years later, now it makes sense.  Fraley's Comet.  See, Fraley's Comet doesn't make sense.  Fraley's Comet sounds like Halley's Comet.  Yeah, I guess it does.  You got it.  Holy shit.  I never noticed it.  God.  I was thinking of the other day. 
[00:34:00]  Even Fraley's Comet I thought was a great name for a bit.  I did too.  Yeah, I know.  I did too, but it didn't make any sense.  Yeah.  Fraley's Comet, Halley's Comet.  At the same time, you have Frampton's Camel.  You got Ritchie, Blackboard's Rainbow.  You know, it was the 80s.  Yeah, we didn't say...  We had Comets, Rainbows, and Camels.  Is that why you came up with the name?  Was it like Halley's Comet, Fraley's Comet?  Well, I was the spaceman and I thought it really fit.  You know, I was actually...  Somebody came up, showed me a picture, an actual great photograph of Halley's Comet. 
[00:34:30]  And it was the first album cover, if you remember correctly.  Fraley's Comet.  Wow.  I never would have...  Fraley's Comet to me was fine.  I never would have connected it.  And he finally...  I just thought it meant compilation.  All the pieces in the puzzle finally fit.  Yeah, finally.  I thought it was Comet just because he was blazing up and down the fretboard.  That's what I thought.  That's what I thought.  Right, right.  No, I knew it was a play on Halley's Comet.  No, you didn't.  No, you didn't.  Of course I did.  I know a lot about space.  He's yelling at me.  It was supposed to be called Ace's Asteroid.  And he said, fuck that.  Am I correct? 
[00:35:00]  No.  No, I don't.  Thank you guys so much.  Thank you, Matt, very much.  Thank you, Ace.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  Eastbound and down.  Danny McBride in studio.  What's up, sir?  Not too much.  How you doing?  I like that you continued to do our show.  Yes.  I really like that.  I like that.  Yeah, he's one of the famous people that comes back.  Loyal.  Yeah.  Kind of famous.  The famous boomerang.  Yes.  Yeah. 
[00:35:30]  You're very good, man.  You have a great career going.  We lose you guys eventually.  Eventually.  But he's hanging in there.  Danny's hanging in there.  Maybe that's why we lose people, because we immediately sabotage you with, gee, us?  Why would you be here with us?  Yeah.  And then they start to think about it and go like, hey, you know you're right.  Why am I with you losers?  Eh.  Why did they put his face on?  I mean, now, there's a controversy around your new film.  It's called 30 Minutes or Less.  You know the controversy is because of the pizza, the real-life pizza disaster. 
[00:36:00]  Did you know that when you were doing this, or did the writers just not know it?  I mean, I don't care whether or not.  What?  About Domino's pizzas being delivered in 30 Minutes or Less, you get it for free?  That controversy?  Yes.  That's a very controversial subject.  Because a lot of people are saying that sometimes you won't get your pizza due to the actual  deliverer having a bomb belt on his throat.  I don't know.  I mean, I can't speak on behalf of the writers, but when I got the script, I didn't, I guess  I had just kind of forgotten about that thing that happened.  Yeah.  I didn't put it together either until just right today. 
[00:36:30]  Because it's so, it's different because, I don't know, it just seemed weird that it's  a chest bomb and not a neck bomb.  That actually made a big difference.  Right.  The thought of having one around your neck seemed really sick.  Yeah.  The chest is kind of acceptable.  Yeah.  I don't know why.  It's bomb the best.  Yeah.  What are you playing this?  I'm sorry.  I was just going to say, you walked us through the original story just before break, and it  was horrific.  Yeah.  The video's really awful.  This is a comedy, though.  This will be better.  Of course.  And you should be able to make fun of this. 
[00:37:00]  This will be better.  It's two different things.  This will be better.  No, but I mean...  One was a real news story, and this is a comedy.  But it's cool.  That we're going to laugh at, because Danny McBride's in it.  Who are you playing in it, Danny?  I play the guy who masterminds this really terrible plan and kidnap Jesse Eisenberg.  Me and Nick Swartzen do.  Oh, Nick Swartzen?  Okay.  Nick makes the bomb that goes on Jesse, and we force him to rob a bank so that I can get  money to pay a hitman to kill my dad.  So it's a very simple, easy plan. 
[00:37:30]  Nick is a funny guy, man.  Love Nick.  He makes Adam Sandler movies tolerable.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Danny's not saying no.  How about...  You're out of that.  Don't worry about it.  Not a word.  You don't have to say anything, Danny.  I know he's gold in Hollywood, but I personally have never gotten the Adam Sandler thing.  How about Aziz?  Aziz is Jesse's best friend in the film.  Okay.  And, you know, Nick and I are the bad guys.  Jesse and Aziz are the good guys.  So most of my stuff was with Nick, and I'd never met Nick before this film, but we got 
[00:38:00]  along swimmingly.  He's a funny, funny dude.  Really funny.  Cracked me up.  Yeah, we've had him on a couple times.  We love Nick.  Yeah, no, I'm happy to see just another one of my friends taking off in the movies.  Him and Aziz, it's always good to see.  You fucking languish from six to ten every morning.  Your friends just taking off in the motion picture industry.  Nothing makes me happier.  And you get to be woken up at 5.30 by Kenny every morning.  Yeah, no, I love it.  I love to just...  Or Kenny, by the way. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  Not Kenny Powers, yeah.  Closer to Kenny has to wake up Jimmy, and he's a bore.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jesse was good in Zombieland.  The same director from Zombieland?  It's the same director, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Because that was...  I like the way Zombieland looked.  This movie has the same sort of like the...  It's really...  It has a nice, tight pace to it.  Yeah.  It's handled really well.  Yeah, that was one of the main reasons I jumped on when I read the script.  The script's hilarious, and just seeing what Ruben did with Zombieland, it's like you  knew that he could kind of handle the comedy and the action and kind of combine them 
[00:39:00]  into something.  Yeah, and put some morbid shit in there and still keep it flat.  That kid's funny.  Yeah, for sure.  Yeah, that kid's hilarious.  And fucking Zombieland was running around.  How much talk was really...  Because this rules cardio.  It's just hilarious.  So I'm just stating funny shit from another movie.  Well, we haven't seen this yet.  Usually we get to see the movies before you guys come in, but for this one, we weren't  able to go to the screening, unfortunately.  How much real talk was there about you taking over for Carell? 
[00:39:30]  What was your name?  Did your name just get thrown in there by a publicist, or were you actually really...  No, I don't...  You know, I would read about it just as anyone else would.  I would just see it in Entertainment Weekly, like, oh, they're considering me for the office?  Wow.  Right?  How great is that?  You don't want to come out and just go, no, they're not, because that would be self-destructive.  That's the kind of thing I would do.  And I would go, no, no, no, they're not at all.  I'm going to immediately take myself out of the story like an asshole.  Boy, Nick's mustache is funny.  30 minutes or less.  This is how dumb I am.  I was at Comic-Con recently, and we saw that 30 minutes or less thing, and I had no idea. 
[00:40:00]  We were across the street from the poster.  I had no idea that I know three out of the four guys that are in it.  That's wrong with you.  Yeah, maybe that's my problem.  I don't network properly.  No.  Fucking Nick's mustache is horrendous.  I really like it.  That's a good one.  Oh, what a terrible 70s mustache they gave fucking Swartzen.  I like sporting one.  Yeah, it's pretty tight.  It's a good one.  Why does he look frightened?  He's standing next to the bomb.  I think he is frightened.  From the trailer, he looks frightened most of the movie because of the bomb. 
[00:40:30]  How is Jesse Eisenberg?  Because he was so good as a fucking complete social misfit in Anti-Social Network.  Or Social Network.  Social Network.  Jesus, I swear.  That's your tour.  Yeah, I know.  And I didn't do that to be funny.  I just made a mistake.  Believe me, that name is done anyway.  That fucking dopey dated name my agent came up with.  It fucking ties in a tour name to a movie.  Why don't we just call it Apocalypse Later, asshole?  We were just touring a bunch of comedians.  My agent's like, oh, the Anti-Social Network.  So we went with it.  But then we're like, the fucking movie's over. 
[00:41:00]  No one cares anymore, you dope.  But how much different is Jesse in this than that?  Well, he's not creating any social networks in this movie at all.  He's obviously not a billionaire, right?  He's like a pot-smoking pizza guy.  So he doesn't have any ambition.  So he's the exact opposite of his character in the Facebook movie.  Do you, when you, this is a corny actor question, but when you go in and do something, do you  say like, all right, I'm figuring out who this guy is?  Or are you pretty much just going there and just start being yourself? 
[00:41:30]  How do you analyze a role when you do it?  Yeah, I don't take it that seriously.  You don't, right?  I just show up.  That's how it's memorized.  All right, he just finished his line.  I know I was supposed to say something.  My turn to talk.  It's my turn.  My turn.  My turn.  My turn.  My turn.  Your turn.  Your turn.  My turn.  My turn.  Your turn.  It's got to be the worst thing an actor can think is, my turn to talk.  Now it's your turn.  You go now.  Yeah.  I'm so bad that I actually, I'll rehearse pauses and facial gestures, like alone in a 
[00:42:00]  mirror.  Like, what do you mean?  Put my arms out.  Meanwhile, the scene.  Arms out, wide eyes.  Yeah.  And then he doesn't talk in the pace or cadence you think he's going to.  Mr. Faber-Sham.  Fuck.  See, you're always off book when you go in.  That's actors talking.  Off book.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It just means you have it memorized.  You've been an off book, Jimmy?  It's impressive.  Ah, you know.  I know.  They want me to go in today for a fucking audition for a Nickelodeon voiceover.  Nice.  Nice.  You do voices?  Yeah, I do.  Fucking, but not for that network, I don't.  They're going to hire me for Nickelodeon. 
[00:42:30]  Why not?  I'm too tired.  I'm going home and going to bed.  You're not even going to go to the audition?  No, I'm not.  Jesus.  No, I'm getting a massage.  I'm going to fucking do something on my stomach that humiliates her and makes me feel good.  And I'm going to nap.  I'm not going on the audition.  Nick Swartzen would go to the audition.  Nick wouldn't have to.  Nick's offer only at this point, I'm pretty sure.  Really?  Wow.  Yeah, Nick doesn't want to.  Maybe he does.  You don't audition, right?  Would you read for something if it's a project, say, that somebody you really love is doing  and they have everybody reading for it?  What's the last time you've read for something?  I'm talking a lot.  You know, I've never even had to audition for a movie before. 
[00:43:00]  Holy shit.  Really?  God, it's that nice.  We just made The Foot Fist Way and then just started getting work off of that.  Right.  That's great, though.  Have you seen Foot Fist Way yet?  No.  I know we talk about it every time Danny's in it.  It's a great movie.  I've heard it's great.  Will Ferrell is.  Yeah.  Will Ferrell discovered you through that, right?  Yep.  We were in a sex chat room.  Nice.  You both realized the other one's not 13 and you had to laugh.  And then he goes and does Due Day, Tropic Thunder, Pineapple Express, Observe and Report, 
[00:43:30]  which we've told you, me and Jimmy love that fucking movie way more than Molotov.  Wait, who are you in Observe and Report?  Oh, my God.  That's not good.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  That's my favorite comedy of the last, I don't know how many years.  I fucking howled in the movie theater at that fucking movie with Ray Liotta.  I hate your fucking guts.  He's scary, isn't he?  He's awesome at it, yeah.  Not many people have intimidated me over the years. 
[00:44:00]  Ray Liotta, when he came in, he actually looked at me at one point and go, what's wrong with  him?  Is he sick?  I was just mesmerized by the guy.  He's fucking intimidating, man.  He really is.  That was cool.  You know, Jody Hill directed Observe and Report.  He's the guy.  He directed Foot Fist Way and he's one of the creators on Eastbound.  So, yeah, he's a pretty sick sense of humor.  That's such a great, that comedy, and again, not that Molotov's bad.  It's just not my sensibility, but it hits a broader audience.  But that Observe and Report is everything the fucking comedy should be.  It was ballsy.  He's fucking brutal.  He's banging her while she's got puke on it. 
[00:44:30]  It's hilarious.  That was great.  Hilarious.  It was so funny, that movie, man.  I love Anna Faris.  And the skateboard in the face is great.  Dude, when Seth takes it, how fucking hard did he smash that kid's face?  Yeah, with a skateboard.  It's everything you want to do with a skateboard.  You want to just cave someone's head in with it.  Absolutely.  Wow, I love that.  I forgot you were in that.  That guy who runs nude, the flasher, at the very end of the movie, is one of our friends  we went to film school with.  And we were like, we really need somebody who will go full nude for this movie and has 
[00:45:00]  a comedy dick.  And Randy happened to have all of that.  And he said it was the greatest moment of his life.  Comedy dick.  Comedy dick.  Has he done anything since?  No, he hasn't.  It's even better, right?  That's so great.  No, a comedy dick would be a fucking small, horrible dick.  Like Ken Jeong is an awful, awful...  Yeah, his dick is the worst ever.  Did you know he was a real doctor?  Yeah.  I didn't.  No, I didn't.  I just wanted to stop the conversation with a boring tidbit about myself.  Mission accomplished. 
[00:45:30]  Where are we at with Eastbound?  We're actually shooting right now.  Nice.  I go back today.  Will Ferrell comes into town tonight.  And so we film with him all this week.  Nice.  Yeah, we're having a blast.  We're about halfway through shooting the third season right now.  Wait, you're shooting in New York?  In North Carolina.  Oh, so you're going back.  Flying back.  Okay, I gotcha.  That's got to be great, though, being able to just work with your friends and shit.  It's the best.  And to be able to do it down there, too, where you're just...  There's no direct flights from Los Angeles to Wilmington, North Carolina. 
[00:46:00]  So that one layer was enough to make all the executives not want to...  A buffer, right?  Keep them away.  Wow, that's nice.  Are they going to get on a fucking prop?  Yeah, exactly.  Aren't they the worst?  Damn, that's nice.  They just ruin everything.  They ruin shit here.  They ruin shit in movies.  Overthinking everything.  Yeah.  Trying to rationalize their own job.  Do you fly private yet?  No.  I have, but it's always been because I've piggybacked on someone who gets to fly private.  Oh, I never have.  How is it? 
[00:46:30]  It's cool.  Every time I get on one of those planes, I just think of La Bamba.  I'm just thinking...  Oh, right, yeah.  You'd hit the ground a lot faster, though.  Yeah, you think so?  Yeah.  You wouldn't even...  Anything at Payne Stewart?  Yeah.  You wouldn't even know.  Those guys knew, man.  They were in the air realizing off.  Yeah, that's true.  Payne Stewart, people probably didn't know.  They probably just lost cabin pressure.  That's the creepiest flight story ever.  It really is.  Payne Stewart.  All catastrophic pressure laws where they were just frozen.  They were dead, and the plane just kept flying and flying.  The fucked up thing is they got a couple F-16s up there to check it out, and when they 
[00:47:00]  were looking, they saw them through the frosted windows just frozen.  All of them.  It's like a ghost plane or something.  That's a fucked up thing.  Hey, why don't you make a comedy about that?  Fucking funny motherfucker.  How long did the plane continue to fly?  Do you remember?  It's still going.  It's still going.  They don't know how to get it down.  It went pretty far.  I think it turned like north or northwest.  It was up there a while after they got it.  That was 99? 
[00:47:30]  Oh, fuck.  Where do these years go, by the way?  I have no idea.  When does Eastbound and Down come out?  I think it's going to come out either January or February of next year.  Oh, that's not too bad.  We don't have to wait too long.  Good.  How many episodes?  This is eight episodes this year.  Is that usually eight or seven episodes?  We've increased it by one episode each year.  Oh, six, seven, and eight?  Oh, that's great.  Oh, that's smart.  Yeah.  That first season.  You can sneak them in there, get a nice long end.  Just one more.  That first season when it was only six, we're like, oh my God, we need more of this.  Yeah.  You were killing us.  This next season is pretty insane. 
[00:48:00]  I mean, it's been wild.  We've been able to get away with everything we've wanted to.  Wow, that's nice.  Can you give us a few examples or a little something here?  Well, a couple of teases.  What can you tell us?  People die this season.  That's a new thing for Eastbound.  Yeah.  Death.  Yeah.  That's fun.  And, you know, we always kind of saw this as something that would be three seasons long.  So we're, yeah, we're trying to execute that and make it, finish this thing with a bang.  See, there's something to be said for that.  The simplicity of only a few, because the great, the office, the British office, 6-6 special. 
[00:48:30]  Fucking extra 6-6 special.  That 6-7-8 special would be great.  You guys should close it out with a special.  So there's no idea what they're talking about, just kind of giving suggestions for the star of a successful show.  By the way, it was the title of that fucking boring dissertation.  Is it tough to do that, knowing you got something so great?  Eastbound and Down is such a, just a great show.  Is it tough to cut it off short like that?  You know, like, our, we never really thought anyone would even watch this when we started. 
[00:49:00]  So for us, we kind of had always committed to this idea of a short order of them.  We do love doing the show and, like, have a good time with the characters.  So, you know, I'm not sure if once the show's over, if it will, if maybe we'll try to, like, make the character live on outside of the show.  Or maybe we'll just come back and do another season in a few years now.  But we're definitely kind of trying to end the story that we set out to tell in the beginning.  You've got to have a lot of fucking confidence, I think, in what you do to be able to stop doing something that's still working and successful. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  Like, oh, I'll just do a next project.  And you're like, oh, really?  I don't consider that winning the fucking lottery, you dummy.  Well, there's a lot of guys that try that and you never heard from them again.  Oh, I know.  That's why I've got to say, you've got to have a lot of confidence.  Oh, my God.  McLean Stevenson?  He was the biggest one.  Hey, hello, Larry.  Come on.  He did hello, Larry.  He goes, ah, I'm ready to move on.  Oh, boy.  You know how sad he must have been when they killed him off?  He probably thought he'd come back for specials and then he read that he goes down the Sea of Japan.  He's like, what the fuck?  I was kidding, guys. 
[00:50:00]  It was a contract ploy.  Right.  I was just trying to get a little heat around myself.  He probably approached them with an episode where he walks up on the beach with a life jacket.  Hey, I'm okay.  He's only cartoon burned.  You know, some black on his face.  Hey, guys.  That's not going to work for everybody.  Hubbla, hubbla.  No, stay away.  Good for you guys ending the series.  Do you write?  How much of the writing do you do for Eastbound?  All of it, yeah.  Oh, you do?  Yeah, Jody and myself write the whole series and that's another reason why we keep it short 
[00:50:30]  is because it's just, you know, it takes about a year from the time you write to shoot the  whole thing to edit it.  So, yeah.  When you write something, do you see, like, okay, so you have six or seven or eight episodes  you're doing.  Do you see kind of where you want the beginning to go to the end of the season or do you kind  of constantly change that as you're going?  We write it like it's one large movie, so we keep every episode open.  We just basically write, like, a 250-page script and, like, break it into 30 minutes.  Oh, shit, so you know how things are going to end and go and then you just fill in the 
[00:51:00]  blanks.  But are there ways, when you go back and do that, do you kind of have to go in and, like,  balloon tie episodes at the end just to kind of make them?  For sure, yeah.  You'll come on to, like, episode six and set up something that, you know, wasn't there,  so you have to go back and open up one and two and figure out how to make those,  kind of set that up and, yeah, it's very painful and, you know, long and boring.  It does seem, like, that's the work part, I guess.  Yeah, that's the work part.  Do you always write in script form?  I'm so weird.  Like, I'll put something in script form, but I have to actually fucking handwrite dialogue 
[00:51:30]  in a notebook for some reason.  It works a lot better for me.  No, we're not like Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind.  We're just really...  Oh, did he do that?  No, let me explain what that was.  That was a nobody desperately trying to think that he has the same process as somebody in season  three.  Oh, yeah, I do notebooks, too.  Oh, really?  Oh, good, I'm on the right track.  God, am I a flop?  He just oozes with self-confidence, doesn't he?  Accuracy.  Nothing worse than false self-confidence. 
[00:52:00]  But that's interesting, though.  I would never have thought to do it that way.  Yeah.  To write it as a full script.  Because you think of shows like The Wire, The Sopranos, they do episodes where they write  the entire arc for each character and then put it together.  Maybe I'll ask somebody from that show.  No, I'm just going to promote a film.  I'm asking about how other people at HBO have done things.  I want to ask Danny about the Beastie Boys video there.  Oh, yeah.  How much fun was that?  That was insane.  I mean...  Who'd you have again?  I mean, yeah.  You, me, Seth, Elijah Wood, and then there was Will, Jack Black, John C. Reilly, Orlando Bloom. 
[00:52:30]  I mean, there was, yeah, Ted Danson, Jason Schwartzman.  I mean, every day.  Ted Danson?  Yeah.  It was nuts.  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  You guys figured out that whole viral video thing where you don't have to deal with the  executives.  That Funny or Die site is great.  Yeah.  That you're a part of.  That you're a part of.  That's a lot of good stuff on there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That Beastie Boys video was so surreal, though.  I remember Seth and I exchanging phone calls after we had got asked to do it.  And then both of us were just there, just tripping out the whole entire time. 
[00:53:00]  It was like every hour, a brand new star comes on, and we're just there watching.  Jesus Christ.  What was the video?  What did you do in the video?  It's like a continuation of the Fight for Your Right to Party video.  It picks up right after the party's over with.  Yeah.  Oh, so it's an acted piece, not a music.  Okay.  It's like mixed in.  It's like Thriller, you know?  Yeah, you know?  Yeah, just like Thriller.  Oh, Oloray.  Remember Oloray?  She was the fucking hot chicken Thriller.  Yes.  That was kind of being date raped before the zombies saved her.  That makes any sense.  He slipped her a Mickey, and then the fucking dead people came. 
[00:53:30]  Mickey.  I know.  Yeah, I'll see ya.  That's the end of the video.  What a great idea.  It really is.  God damn it.  That's a fucking creative good idea.  What's that?  30 minutes?  That's a long song.  Wow, this is 30 minutes long?  Yeah, it's like a little mini movie.  Wow.  Holy shit.  That's a short.  Like Thriller.  You guys got a video on YouTube, 3 million views for a 30 minute video. 
[00:54:00]  Wow.  How did you get 30 minutes on YouTube?  I thought you could only do 10 minutes.  Well, it's the Beastie Boys.  Yeah.  And they're stars.  They're not regular Joes like us.  Oh, they fight.  They call up YouTube and go, hey, guess what?  We're going to give you 30 minutes.  They're like, take it or leave it.  Make sure no one else is allowed to upload for the next two days.  Or we'll put it on something else.  Yeah, sure.  I wonder if that's also so movies can't be pirated and uploaded full.  No, they just want to save their bandwidth.  Or people would just be uploading nonsense all the time, right? 
[00:54:30]  30 minutes or less.  We haven't done the movie justice.  We should talk about this a little more.  Well, it's with Danny.  It's with Nick Swartzen, who's also very funny.  And, of course, Jesse Eisenberg, who's great.  And Aziz Ansari, who's on fucking Parks and Recreation and selling out theaters.  And he's hugely popular.  I like to drive a fucking pen into my hand like Luca Brasi, as I'm describing his resume.  Fothers you a little bit?  No, it's yes and no. 
[00:55:00]  It's like you always have a love-hate thing.  It's like they are funny guys.  So it's like I'm happy to see funny guys getting work because it gives you faith.  Like, all right, at least it's funny people working and not shitheads.  Like, when you see shitheads succeeding, it stinks.  But it's funny guys in the movie, it's like, all right, well, that feels fair.  And I think Aziz uses notebooks, too.  He writes notebooks, too.  He does.  He's a little weirdo.  Because I see him all the time at the Comedy Cellar.  And he'll actually have his headphones on.  He fucking works.  He's not lazy.  And he'll sit there and jot things down from his headphones for the next set, like I did years ago,  before I just finally realized it's over. 
[00:55:30]  But we love doing radio.  I do.  No, I actually do love doing radio.  I'd say actually to really convince myself what a liar I am.  This business gets no respect is our problem, Daddy.  Yeah.  Yeah, that really is.  We're the shit of the entertainment business.  Yeah.  We really are.  It's just no respect.  It's where other people come until they get really successful.  Yeah.  Then they never again want to set foot.  Or when Hollywood's done with them, then they go and do radio.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So.  On the way up and on the way down.  Yeah, that's. 
[00:56:00]  That's where we see people.  We're really not making him want to come back.  No, I know.  That's terrible.  I wouldn't apply for an internship.  Are you guys?  Oh, we're not allowed to have any of them.  Yeah, we're not allowed to have any of those of an incident.  Yeah.  Oh, that's nice.  We're a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Yeah.  That's what we are.  We have very big celebrities come in, and then we say negative things about ourselves,  and naturally they don't want to come back.  We're just busting balls.  It's like being on a first date and saying to a girl, rape, shmape.  That's ever been said seriously. 
[00:56:30]  I would hope not.  Yeah.  By some defense attorney.  You know, even fucking public defendant.  He doesn't want to take the case.  Rape, shmape.  Come on.  So, all right.  So, four very funny guys, and Jesse plays the guy that they strap the bomb to.  Yep.  And so the thing is, he's a pizza delivery guy.  He goes, and you and Nick grab him.  Yes.  And you want to force him to kill your father, or get money to hire an assassin?  Force him to kill the father would be the easiest plan.  But instead, we force him to rob a bank so I can pay a hitman to do it. 
[00:57:00]  Is it explained why you don't just force him to kill the father, and then blow them both up?  It's not.  No.  They should have used the notebooks and figured that out.  Figured that whole thing out.  That probably would cut out a lot of the funnier parts if he just went straight to the murder.  Yeah, I don't think Jesse has the murderer instinct in him.  Yeah, a lot harder to get somebody to kill someone than to rob a bank.  Oh, you know what?  Under duress.  There you go.  You're absolutely right.  That's it.  So, I almost said to him, so what happens?  Meaning, how does it end? 
[00:57:30]  And I realized what a dumb thing it would be.  Please just spoil it for everyone?  Could you just do that?  Yeah.  You realize Larry King wasn't as bad at what he did as I thought he was.  Well, I almost fucking asked that question.  So, seriously, does he die at the end?  Are you all kidding aside?  I'm a goddamn fool.  Oh, right.  They're dressed in a gorilla and an ape.  Which one is you?  I'm the ape.  Nick is the little chimp.  That's a chimp, yeah.  Did you actually have to film those scenes, or was somebody standing?  No, that's actually us in 100-degree weather wearing monkey masks. 
[00:58:00]  But they could just put anyone in there.  You're a big star now.  Yeah, well, not anyone has those hands.  Yeah, yeah.  People would be like, I could tell.  I could tell.  I would hate it, especially if you drank coffee, then you have to smell your own breath on  the inside of a fucking monkey mask.  Oh, yeah.  They get pretty ranked by the end of the shit.  They do, right?  Yeah, it's pretty smelly.  Wouldn't you hate to wear somebody else's fucking monkey mask?  How awful would that be?  Right there where the mouth is, your nose would be smelling.  Somebody that has that fucking sweet plaque breath all the time. 
[00:58:30]  They actually only had one of each of those masks, and so when the stand-in would have  to come, they'd set the shot, they would put the mask on, and there were definitely  a few times where they'd hand the mask back to you, and it's just soaking wet.  Oh, fuck that.  I'll put it back on.  Why do they have to wear the mask?  Couldn't they just wear a hat that says G and C?  You've got to really see how the light hits the monkey's mouth.  Oh, it was for that?  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  See?  Just don't think of that stuff.  I would have made them hold it.  Just fucking hold the thing in front. 
[00:59:00]  Smash it against your face.  Yeah, just stand there and hold it.  Absolutely, you're not putting my thing on.  To be in a major motion picture?  I wouldn't give a fuck.  I'd share condoms to be in a movie.  It's easy to talk shit when you're here.  Exactly.  Come on, Danny.  Why would you tolerate that?  Exactly, man.  That's actually a really cool fucking...  Is that the poster for it?  That's the trailer.  That's the trailer?  That's the trailer.  Is that the poster for it?  I don't know.  Aunt Jim, is it?  Aunt Jim?  Stupid question.  Sorry. 
[00:59:30]  Jimmy is fucking...  You're a disaster today, Seth.  He's hurting on himself now.  He really is.  I literally had no sleep at all.  I was playing chess until two in the morning on fucking chess with friends and I couldn't  sleep.  That's...  I remember when you used to tell horrid stories of prostitution and maybe I played chess.  Yeah.  I was playing with a transsexual who was fucking me.  Oh, okay.  Which was so hard to see if he was cheating behind me.  Still sitting on the picture.  I suspected he was fucking...  Getting text advice from another friend. 
[01:00:00]  So is there anything we're missing with the movie?  Because I don't want to not...  I honestly don't want to sell the film short.  I'm looking forward to it.  It is really, really funny.  It's an awesome movie.  It...  You know, Ruben, a lot of his inspiration for this are things like Dog Day Afternoon and  Heat and all these crazy bank robber movies and throwing a little comedic spin on it.  So it's definitely, you know, something that you haven't seen before.  Do you guys have...  Do you guys have...  Is there anybody there that has like a sunny vibe?  You know, maybe there's a Leon in the fucking barber chair.  Oh, yeah.  Leon. 
[01:00:30]  No.  You're not dying, Danny.  You're killing everyone around you.  You can do Leon Schermer all day.  So, all right.  It comes out, what?  The fucking...  Week from Friday.  You never want to sell a movie short, but it's like, I don't know what to ask you about  it without giving it away.  I know.  The cast is doing it.  That's why we like seeing the movies ahead of time.  Then we could kind of...  I'll post it on YouTube tonight for you guys.  That would rule.  In 30-minute increments.  Is that fine?  Yeah.  In 30-minute increments.  Yeah.  Are you married, man, Danny?  I am.  Oh, yeah?  Expecting a child in eight weeks. 
[01:01:00]  Damn.  You don't have to boy or girl?  Boy.  Nice.  Do you have a name picked out?  We have a few names picked out, and we stopped telling people because the first few just  got...  You tell them to your friends, and they kind of give you that like, oh, really?  They're fucking assholes.  Soda.  Yeah.  Soda's a great name.  Soda.  People are just assholes.  They can't just be happy for you.  Like, oh, that's a nice name.  Self-problem.  Does it hurt to say it's a nice name?  They always got to go, oh, my God, really?  Yeah, then you start feeling self-conscious.  Right.  But is that them being assholes, or is that like friends being honest with you and like preventing 
[01:01:30]  yourself and the kid from having 20 years of humiliation?  How about when it's too late, the kid's already born, and you tell someone their name?  Oh, really?  Yeah, that's what you went with?  Yeah.  You got that?  Yes.  Who did that to you?  A few people in my family.  Family?  And then some lady in the elevator goes, that's a dog's name.  Oh, what a bitch.  I want a fucking strangler.  Wow.  She's a lonely bitch with a dog.  Yeah, they just say shit.  That's a dog's name.  So you're obviously going with a little different name.  Hepatitis.  Nice.  See, that's great, because if you want him to watch something, you can go, Hepatitis C? 
[01:02:00]  See, he's quick, Danny.  He's quick.  That's good.  Hepatitis A.  I could do the same joke a third time with B.  Fucking redundant asshole.  We got it, Jim.  Right on, man.  What was the name that got rejected, though?  Was it named after somebody?  Were you looking to name him after somebody, and the people were like, eh?  Well, that name is still on the table, so it technically falls in the rule that my wife  has said that I'm not allowed to tell them.  Yeah, fair enough.  Yeah, yeah.  Did you guys debate? 
[01:02:30]  Is it hard when you want to name, it's your first child?  Yeah.  Now, did you immediately suggest Daniel?  I didn't suggest my own name ever.  No.  So you didn't want that?  No.  Is it hurt feelings when one of you suggests something that means something?  Like, well, that's my grandfather's name, or that was my uncle's name, and the other  person's like, eh?  Yeah.  Yeah, you got to just watch it.  Yeah, exactly.  You have to tread lightly.  Yeah, I know the different names of her relatives, so when those names come up, I know, like,  all right, well, we'll just work on this a little bit more subtly to get that out of  the list, yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:03:00]  We'll change the spelling.  Yeah.  Is one person going to win, or is there, like, you know, with you and your wife, do you both  agree immediately, or is there...  No, man, right up until the last second, we just didn't know.  You kind of bat it around?  Yeah, I got a 14-month-old.  Oh, congrats.  It's awesome.  These guys don't like hearing about it, but it's the most amazing thing ever.  I don't mind hearing about it.  I'm just, I'm fucking with you guys.  Whenever I hear about it, I'm just like, oh, thank God, I don't have to fucking do that  because I can't.  I don't want to change diapers or, you know.  Oh, this time period has been nuts when you just lay in bed and you just see, like, 
[01:03:30]  the stomach moving.  Oh, yeah.  It's like an alien.  I do that alone.  Wow.  Yeah.  Fucking horrible body.  Fucking roast beef sandwich in there.  Do you really feel, you put your ear into the stomach and stuff, you hear it kicking?  Oh, yeah, it's nuts.  You can feel it.  You can feel it moving around, yeah.  It really is.  My wife has only put on, like, 15 pounds since she's been pregnant.  I think I put on, like, fucking 30 pounds.  I'm eating for three.  So you got the room all set up that you're going to have the kid in?  We're just getting it set up now.  Yeah, we finished shooting the show and then, like, three weeks later, the baby's stiff. 
[01:04:00]  So I've been talking to him a lot through her belly, telling him to hang out in there,  don't come early.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So you already feel a bond?  Totally.  I guess it's a dumb question to ask a parent, but I've never even come close to having kids.  And it's like, but now is a good time to do it.  You're making money.  You're fucking successful.  It's like, you know.  Did you do the 3D imaging?  We did.  That stuff's pretty nuts, isn't it?  That's fucked up.  It's a sonogram, right?  We haven't talked about it yet.  Oh, it's given in a sonogram.  No, it's a 3D image on a TV.  You're looking at, in my case, my son. 
[01:04:30]  I'm like, what?  Sounds like an MRI looks, you know?  But he's smiling and he's laughing in there and doing all sorts of shit.  He's already a human being.  He's in a vagina.  The kid's laughing.  No wonder he's happy.  When they pop their face out and get hit, they're like, what the fuck is this nonsense?  He's itching his face, the one we got.  He's itching.  It's fucking bizarre.  Can you watch them move like that?  Acclamation.  Yeah, they move.  This is what it looks like.  Let me see, Travis.  That's 3D imaging.  Imagine that as a video.  But look at this.  He's got his tongue out.  He's rude.  I wouldn't want to see that.  What a bad boy. 
[01:05:00]  What are you doing?  You're showing the movie again, Travis.  You're trying to see 3D imaging.  I'm going to show you a video.  Oh.  Yeah, you've got to see the video of this shit.  But it's, it's, I, it's unbelievable.  Oh, that's ultrasound.  No, that's not as good.  That's ultrasound.  You have, you sap.  I don't know.  Yeah, that's ultrasound.  I know.  What are you doing?  3D.  There you go.  That's one.  I don't know what's happening here.  Look at this shit.  What's it doing?  It's moving.  Ew.  Wow.  It's Avatar.  Isn't it weird?  Yeah, that is just strange, man.  How boring is it in there, though?  You're all cramped up.  Yeah, but you're just napping.  Yeah, you're just chilling out, man. 
[01:05:30]  The lady who did ours was like talking about my son's pecker the whole time.  She was like, isn't it like pathetic I sit here and rub things on bellies to make boys' dicks hard?  And it was this thing where we were.  Holy shit.  Yeah, she dropped that in there.  We were just like, me and my wife were like, wow, this lady.  Wow.  The kid got a rod?  It's the first, his first handy.  Wow.  What fetishes he's going to have are fucking sonograms.  I can't get an erection unless you just rub this thing over my stomach.  It's a long story.  When you see your kid for the first time in the belly, they always go, you want to know the sex. 
[01:06:00]  And as soon as you say yes, they go, all right, here's the dick.  Wow.  They go right for the fucking private area and say, there you go.  Well, that's pretty much how they do it.  That really is the only way.  I know, but instead of thinking, maybe they just say it.  They're like, okay, you want to know?  And all of a sudden this dick pops up on the screen like, oh, I guess it's going to be a boy.  Do they show you or do they tell you?  They show.  They show you.  Oh, they don't tell you, boy or girl?  No, they go, all right, here you go.  Were you kind of happy it was a son?  Was your wife kind of want a daughter or you guys didn't?  Everyone says they don't care because you kind of have to say that.  We were cool with whatever, but I was the firstborn in my family, so I kind of wanted 
[01:06:30]  to weirdly just replicate that.  So I was hoping to get a boy.  Get the boy out of the way and then it doesn't matter, I think.  They're creepy looking in there.  Actually, I don't want a girl.  It would be great if they said it's a daughter and you start screaming, what the fuck?  This is bullshit.  I'm not interested.  I don't want to make a big scene in the fucking room.  When I found out I was a boy, one of my friends was like, if it's a boy, you only have to  worry about one dick.  If it's a girl, you have to worry about all the dicks in the world.  Wow, you know what?  Great way to look at it. 
[01:07:00]  You know, it's funny, too, about naming things.  I've always been bad about, I've made gender errors my whole life, believe me.  My first cat was a Manx who was a boy, but I thought it was a girl, so I named him Susan.  But then it turned out.  Wow, this makes total sense.  It turned out it was a fucking boy, so I had to name him John.  And then I found a cat outside who I thought was a boy, so I named her William.  And then it turned out it was a girl.  I've made gender errors with both of my cats.  Yeah.  That's actually the theme of the show that I'm writing. 
[01:07:30]  And out the window of your Saturn, too, apparently.  Oh, please.  Of course.  Exactly.  At least I didn't pay one of the cats to blow me and pretend I didn't see fucking  Scruff on the side.  How awful that is.  I have to hand over $50 to realize you've been duped.  I'd love to fucking just yell at a tranny, can I speak to your manager, please?  This is not what I was promised.  Duped.  Yeah.  False advertising.  That was humiliating.  Hey, before we let you go, K-Swiss, you enjoying that campaign, too?  That campaign is a lot of fun. 
[01:08:00]  You know, when they came to us with that, Jody and I were very apprehensive about it.  We're like, well, I don't know.  There's not really a point of reference for where this has worked before.  And they gave us these scripts, and it was just as filthy as our show was.  And so, yeah, it was just a fun way to kind of take the character outside the show and  just be able to have some fun with them.  And we shot the new ads right before we started shooting this season, so it was a nice way  to kind of get the feet wet again, get back in there.  Right.  What's K-Swiss?  He's doing a whole campaign with K-Swiss as Kenny Powers.  Oh, okay. 
[01:08:30]  You'd love it, Jim.  You should check them out.  They're great.  You do some such stuff, though, man.  You don't do any soft comedies.  Everything you're in has got some balls to it, which is nice to see.  Okay.  Until I have this kid.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It'll be all about, like, you know, it's about the children now.  Why say fuck when you can say friggin'?  Can I ask you about that?  What do you feel about comedies in general?  Well, I mean, are we starting – it seems like we're starting to move, you know, toward  edgy again, finally.  Yeah.  I mean, that's how I like comedy.  I mean, I like to see rated-R comedy. 
[01:09:00]  I like to go in there and know that anything is on the table.  You know, I feel like when it's a PG-13 comedy – not that they're not good PG-13 comedies,  there are, but, you know, you kind of feel like you're going in there and you know that  they're only going to be able to take it so far.  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  I like a nice R.  And for a while there, they got rid of the whole comedy genre, and it was rom-coms.  That's where the comedies went.  Yeah.  There weren't fucking movies for just – I hate to say it, but just guys.  We talk about those where the guy and the girl are back-to-back, leaning with their arms 
[01:09:30]  crossed, looking at each other like, all right.  We know what's going on with you.  She's like, oh, boy, I know you.  And then they'll meet.  They'll have to like each other for some reason where they're not really liking each other.  Right.  And then they'll really like each other.  And then something will break them apart, and then they'll realize how much they like  each other.  Back to the other, movie's over.  But for a while, that's all they were making.  They didn't have a down-and-dirty comedy.  I don't think Matthew McConaughey's ever taken a picture facing another woman on a movie 
[01:10:00]  guy's back-to-back.  Oh, boy, let me tell you.  Oh, God.  See, there you go.  There you go.  I actually want to make a movie cover like that where the guy and the girl are back-to-back  and call the film The Beheading.  And then it's all about a fucking horrible kidnapping, beheading, gone well in Mexico.  Nothing to do with the cover at all.  Oh, look at that one.  I'm proposing to you.  Oh, boy, I'm scared of this.  Oh, you're coming.  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just get back to making down-and-dirty comedy. 
[01:10:30]  What's the cover for 30 minutes or less?  Oh, you don't want to see it.  They're back-to-back.  I've got a bomb.  Oh, boy.  He's going to blow himself up.  Safe to say that's not what you're going to see with 30 minutes.  Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon.  Spear.  I'm Reese Witherspoon.  Yes, the four Christmases thing.  Four Christmases, yeah.  They're facing away from each other.  They're wrapped in a big bow.  Yeah.  Kind of like chained together like some nonsense is going to occur.  There's going to be some fun and hijing.  Oh, boy, the breakup.  Oh, the breakup.  Oh, boy. 
[01:11:00]  Looks like they got problems.  Those must be the most uncomfortable shoots.  But meanwhile, here I am attacking movie box fucking covers.  And to do a movie, I would do whatever.  I would take a donkey dick in my face and smile.  Oh, boy.  Looking on my shoulder and it's fucking leaking stuff on my...  We'll get you on the eastbound if you'll take a donkey dick in your face.  I'll take one even if you don't.  Just get me on the set to watch, I'll take one.  These aren't just jokes. 
[01:11:30]  He will absolutely do this, Danny.  All right.  Danny McBride, a pleasure, obviously.  Hey, you guys take care.  Thanks for having me back on.  Thank you.  All right, man.  See you soon.  See you.  Take it easy.  This is the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Sirius XM.  There'll be a new Jack Pussler.  Oh, yeah.  That means one thing.  Ice-T is in the studio.  I was ready to say in the house.  I'm in the house.  I would have sounded really, really old school.  Yeah, yeah.  When the building.  I'm reading the prep sheet. 
[01:12:00]  I never knew this.  You were in the break-in films?  Yep.  That was my first time being in movies.  What did you do in break-in or break-in to?  Oh, okay.  You had a small part?  Like, you know, when Shabadoo and Boogaloo Shrimp and them were in the club, I was the  guy on the stage.  And I was rapping.  And it was kind of like a featured background person.  I didn't have lines.  I just rapped.  I think I did know that, actually.  Maybe I have heard that before.  I haven't watched the break-in movies in a while.  I thought Beach Street was a little better.  I mean, you know, from my experience in white suburban North Brunswick, I have no idea 
[01:12:30]  which one was more realistic.  But I preferred Beach Street.  And we want to say good morning to Coco, too, of course, who's here with Ice-T.  I'm here.  Yes, right and early.  I was just telling Ice-T that usually we like to see the show before you guys come in,  and we didn't get an advanced copy.  And then you said quickly that it's a comedy.  Well, you know, we went to shoot the show.  Eight years ago, they came at us to shoot a show.  Coco did this thing called Hip-Hop Wives, and they wanted to do one.  And I was like, nah, reality show to break up the marriage and everything, I'm not with it. 
[01:13:00]  You know, ten years, you know, eight years later, they kept coming.  E, they kept coming.  And finally, I said, look, we'll do it under one circumstance.  It's that you really shoot us.  You get us, and you don't twist it.  You know, because my relationship is important to me.  If we fight or whatever, we'll do it.  But don't add anything.  Fake drama.  No fake drama.  Like assisted reality.  Assisted.  Or edited in a way to make it worse than it really was.  Right.  After the first show, they said,  you guys got a comedy. 
[01:13:30]  You know?  And I'm like, I'm funny.  And we started to look at the scenes, and I'm like,  kind of funny, you know, when you look at it.  Yeah.  So it came out as a comedy, and we shot all eight shows.  I've seen them.  We're very happy with them.  And I'm very critical, you know.  I'm protecting myself.  I'm not going to lie.  But I didn't touch one frame of any show.  I just said, let it go.  It looks good.  Oh, there was nothing you wanted out?  You were fine with all of it?  I mean, you know, I'm in control of what I do.  I just, like I said, I just don't need a twist or something put on there, you know. 
[01:14:00]  So they got the tone of it, and I'm very happy of it.  So it's a reality show I'm proud of.  But Coco will tell you, it's like we broke the trend.  Well, I believe we broke the trend.  Because nowadays, everything is a train wreck, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  And it seems, this is really a housewife show.  And you see, this is, if you lay across, like, every network has, like, a housewife show,  including housewives of this, housewives of that, housewife.  And it's like, they seem to be unhappy.  Yeah.  You know, and this is the one. 
[01:14:30]  In a mansion.  In a mansion, right.  And this is the one housewife show where I'm very happy.  Yeah.  And I've proved that we can be together for 10 years and still be happy.  And under the circumstances that I work for ICE, you know, I'm his assistant.  So I'm not just the housewife that stays at home.  I'm the cute housewife that is an assistant.  She's like my Sharon Osbourne.  She keeps me together, holds it there, you know.  Who's the boss, though?  Because Sharon certainly runs that operation.  Well, I'm a very organized, anal person, you know. 
[01:15:00]  Don't say anal on this.  All these guys just got erections.  That's your brain.  Listen to me and I know what goes on in this.  He's reading the room.  I'm just going to say anal.  Why do you make it so easy for us?  But I am.  I'm very, very, I'm very much of a perfectionist.  And, you know, he needs that.  His life was so unorganized when I came in, you know, and I just slightly organized him. 
[01:15:30]  And here he is, you know.  I mean, I guess if you say who's the boss, at the end of the day, I'll have the final say.  But I don't, my job is not to override everything she's doing because I have her in charge trying to make things right.  So we got to balance it out, you know.  Some guys just don't want their woman to have any say.  So I'm like, well, then there's only one person running the show.  I mean, I appreciate having a partner because a lot of things.  And as an artist, I can generate money.  I'm just not into crossing the T's and dotting the I's, you know. 
[01:16:00]  So that's just not my thing.  So I want to do the art.  And I would watch just Osbournes.  And I'm like, would Ozzy have a mansion if it wasn't for sure?  I mean, does he even know he's on TV?  And I'm a big fan of Oz, you know.  And when he does his thing, can nobody touch him?  But that's his thing.  Now, paying phone bills, I don't know if that's what Ozzy does.  Yeah, Ozzy's not a receipt saver.  Right, right, right.  Exactly.  We'll write this dinner off.  Yeah, I can't see him saying that.  That's probably not Ozzy's thing either.  You're right, but that's what she does. 
[01:16:30]  A lot of artists, but I hope you watch the money.  Because a lot of artists, especially with royalties, musicians,  get fucked by the companies and by people because they don't watch the trail.  It's hard for me.  I've already done that.  I've already, you know, lost the money because of that.  Fortunately, I've been in the game 25 years.  So I've gone through that zone of wasting money.  I had 15 cars, you know, giving all your money to your friends.  I've been through that.  Business managers and managers or whatever that don't look out for you.  The whole thing.  Wow. 
[01:17:00]  But fortunately, I've been able to sustain.  And, you know, now that I've gotten on Law & Order, I've been on there 12 years.  I've got my books tight and everything.  So I survived the, you know, the coming of age of a celebrity where you usually,  if you don't make it past that point, you're through.  You know what?  He just described MC Hammer, who we had in here.  And he couldn't keep sustaining it.  And that's the problem with MC Hammer.  So he gave all his money away as he was going, but then all of a sudden the money stopped coming in. 
[01:17:30]  And then he was in deep trouble.  There's a guilt that goes along with success.  You know, when you're making it and all your friends aren't.  And you want to help them.  Bring some people up.  Yeah.  And, you know, you can't even come around your neighborhood in a new car because everybody's still broke.  And you want to see your friends come and you want to go on vacation, but you don't want new friends.  So you bring your friends.  It starts to cost a lot of money, you know.  But after you've done it for a long enough time.  Now, my boys is like, Ice already paid us.  He did more than he had to do.  Can he live? 
[01:18:00]  Let him live.  Let him live.  He doesn't owe anybody nothing, you know.  So I've made it through that growing period of fame.  And people that come from nothing, they understand that.  You know, you got your family.  And it's not that they're asking for it.  You feel guilty in a way to say, I won.  Because of your success, you mean?  Or like you have what they don't have.  And it's like, yeah, yeah.  You start to feel like, I'm obligated to do something.  And then there's some that will.  Sugar Ray Leonard was in the other day.  In his book, he's talking about the people and how they just don't stop asking you for money. 
[01:18:30]  Family, friends.  Well, you just got to say no after a while.  It's hard, though, right?  It's hard.  It's hard, but after a while.  And then you say no.  You say, I'm not doing it anymore.  I'm that.  You tell them, look, I got to pay taxes.  I got this.  I got that.  And they go, I can tell my friends, look, man, I owe a million dollars.  And I got to do this.  And I got to do that.  And I'm having this.  And they go, OK, I get it.  Yeah, it's bad.  But can I still borrow $5?  It's like, no matter what you say, they're like looking at what they see.  And you're on TV.  You know, I mean, how can you not? 
[01:19:00]  Right, right.  By the way, you missed it.  Let me tell everybody what they missed.  Ice-T said you're on TV.  And three desperate faces looked up.  He was speaking kind of metaphorically.  We've had a wild two days.  Yeah, it got a little crazy.  I wanted to ask you about going pretty much from gangster to mainstream over the years.  You successfully pulled that off.  Yeah.  Were you catching any flack when you first kind of started going mainstream about your street cred and people going like, you sell out and shit like that? 
[01:19:30]  The only time I ever get it is from a square, you know, like the cats from the hood know they're happy to see me successfully.  You know what I'm saying?  They know that, you know, when you're in the streets doing that, you're doing that because those are the options that are open to you.  As new options open, if you don't take them, you're a sucker.  You come from the ghetto complaining about not having an opportunity, then you get an opportunity. 
[01:20:00]  And you don't take it, then you're a sucker.  Now, you got corny people on the sideline.  Oh, he's lost his street cred, you know.  What the fuck do you know about street cred?  Any damn way.  You know, I mean, my street cred is bulletproof.  I've done whatever has to be done to get the street cred.  That's why I just put out my new book called ISIS Road from South Central to Hollywood.  And it shows the transition.  But, you know, those who say don't know and those who know don't say.  I'm far from a cop. 
[01:20:30]  Trust me.  Just trust me, you know.  I'm a good actor.  I love that explanation.  You put out, by the way, the book, right?  Pimp.  You put out.  I wrote the foreword to Pimp by Iceberg Slim.  Right.  You kind of re-released it or whatever.  Yeah, you know, because I admired Iceberg and that's where I got my name.  But then at some point in reading the books, of course, at first I wanted to live his life.  Then I realized he's a writer.  At some point it hit me like he's a writer.  So if I really want to be held forever in people's hearts and in their minds, I need to document the game. 
[01:21:00]  It's not about being the biggest hustler on the street.  It's the one who wrote about it.  That's who gets to, you know, last forever.  It's an amazing book.  I've read it twice.  I've read it too.  I love it.  When was he alive?  Like the 40s?  Yeah.  And we just did a movie on his life too.  Oh.  We did a documentary on It's Not Done.  But, you know, that's what my music was meant to be, like documentation of the game.  Are there photos of him?  And who was the guy, the other one, who had the cat, Miss Peaches? 
[01:21:30]  Who was that tall, bald pimp who I think he got everything from?  That's the guy I want to see a photo of.  Oh, my God.  Damn.  It's probably been a while, right?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm trying.  I'm supposed to know that name.  I don't know it either.  Yeah.  Well, see, probably his name was Mack.  That's a good name for a pimp, Mack.  You know?  But, you know, that's what it is.  So if you read my book, my book is kind of like in the same sense.  It shows the growth and it shows all the different channels I went through in music. 
[01:22:00]  And, yeah, then how do you end up on Law & Order?  Right.  How did that happen?  But, you know.  That was a great run.  Hey, I'm still on it.  You know, I just re-signed for another couple years.  Nice.  You know, I'm able to do that.  Then I'm over here doing my rock band, playing Cop Killer over on this side of town.  You know, it's just those people that really know me, when they watch our TV show, they'll  laugh.  They'll go, yo, that's ice right there.  Because I'm comfortable with who I am.  Some of the music you did years ago, does it kind of seem silly now, all the fuss that 
[01:22:30]  was made of it when you look at what's going on in music today and on the internet and whatnot?  Yeah, well, you know, come on.  I mean, everything seems silly in retrospect.  It's like the news is real stupid, period.  It's like every time, you know, breast implants will explode on a plane.  Oh, you know, every time something, every time something, I'm like, what happened?  Did pit bull stop biting people?  That was like happening for a while.  That was the big story.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:23:00]  Like the big stories just rotate.  So I was just one of the big stories.  Right, right.  It's all stupid.  I mean, considering what's really going on.  Yeah, you know what?  At the time, it was such a big story and everybody was totally hating you.  And it almost seems nostalgic and kind of funny now that there was such a fuss made of,  you know, music.  The president was after me.  Yeah, yeah.  But now I have something.  How many people can actually say that the president of the United States of America spoke their name  in anger? 
[01:23:30]  You and Kanye West.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But even when Kanye came out and said the president doesn't like black people, I'm like,  uh, have you listened to Public Enemy?  It's like, this is not a new comment, you know?  Right, right, right.  This is new.  But Kanye, you know, he said something at the time.  And, you know, when you look down there and you look at New Orleans where it was,  he saw those people sitting out in the street and the floods.  That's how it seemed.  It didn't really look like anybody cared.  I don't think Beverly Hills would have been floating around that long. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah, he spoke his mind and then, uh, goddamn, uh, Mike, Michael, uh, Myers.  Mike Myers was next to him at the time and his face just, he looked at him like, why am I being dragged into this shit?  He just wanted to read a few lines and get off the stick.  I've never seen such a pretend that didn't just happen face.  He just stared straight ahead hoping everything would go away and he'd wake up and he wouldn't be there.  You see any of the other, uh, PE guys?  Oh, definitely. 
[01:24:30]  I just did a movie.  I just finished, uh, directing a movie called The Art of Rap, where I interviewed a lot of MCs from back in the days.  Probably Chuck D, of course.  Yeah.  And it's more of a movie about how, uh, how you rap.  Not, not the money, the girls, the cars.  It's like the art form.  Right.  So, uh, we're going to have that out later this summer too.  What do you think changed about, like, cause you listen to rap from like the, uh, like Run DMC and the way they were and, and the way it is now lyrically, it's a lot different.  It went pop.  You think it got more pop? 
[01:25:00]  No, it's pop.  It's pop music now.  Now what you're doing is you're listening to what you're hearing on the radio.  It's pop music with a rap delivery.  See, you could rap, anybody can rap, but that's not hip hop.  Hip hop has a special sound to it.  It has a special vibe to it.  But when you, you know, you're doing a pop record and then you, then you just happen to rap that doesn't, you know, pink can rap, you know, there's a lot of people that can rap.  So it's, it's, it's, it's, it's lost his soul if you ask me.  But, uh, I say that meaning I want to inspire the soul to come back. 
[01:25:30]  I'm not saying it like a hater.  I just want the kids to bring the soul back.  I'd love to see an 18 year old public enemy group come out right now.  Young kids or some, a new KRS one, because no matter what we do, we're old now.  We're older than them.  We're the parents age.  So the kids don't want, so they need somebody from their generation to come out and rock the world.  What happened to KRS one?  I just like, I, he's still out there, but you know, once now, since we live in a pop culture, if you're not on the radio, then people don't think you exist. 
[01:26:00]  You know, you have to be on the radio.  The little girls right now, they like, if it's not on MTV, then it must not be good.  And then MTV doesn't even play music anymore.  One last thing.  I was, I was talking to a 21 year old girl the other day doing me doing an interview.  She said, ice about music.  And I said, well, I made my music, my money in music when people went to the record store.  Yeah.  She said, what's a record store?  I swear to God.  Yep.  And I said, like, tower owner, like, where, how, oh, oh, virgin, oh, F-Y, oh, she said, like, Best Buy. 
[01:26:30]  Oh, shit.  And I said, well, they're trying to sell microwaves, really.  And Best Buy is even pushing kind of the music out.  You go to Best Buy and try to find something.  They don't care.  Nothing's in alphabetical order anymore.  It's just kind of just thrown around.  It's all electronic delivery.  You ever think you'd see the day that there would be no bookstores and no record stores in our lifetime?  Are you crazy?  Dude, I got people, you know, cause I'm from the music.  Every day an artist walks up to me.  I want to get put on ice. 
[01:27:00]  Can you help me?  And I ask him, I say, well, what's the last record you bought?  And they give me this blank face.  I'm like, so this is the industry you're trying to get into.  Yeah.  Now you ask why I'm on television.  Right.  You know?  Goddamn, yeah.  But you can't get, I went to get the Aussie box set.  Of course you did.  I know.  Of course you did.  Every discussion goes back to Aussie.  But I tried to.  I went into Best Buy.  Yep.  They didn't have it.  It's like you had to order it or go to a specialty store in Jersey.  They just, you can't get any type of specialty stuff like that.  Unless it's the Beatles or somebody that's going to sell everywhere. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  It's crazy.  Wiener's on TV.  What the hell was that guy?  Oh, yeah.  Well.  I think he's just trying to live up to his name, right?  Yeah.  The Wiener thing.  That was not that impressive a dick.  I'm sorry.  It just wasn't.  No.  All smoke and mirrors.  No.  It was the fact that, you know, he was, you know, he's a politician.  He was lying.  Oh, so what does that do?  Yeah.  A politician lying and showing porn pictures of himself.  They're all doing it.  Come on.  It's like everybody is doing that shit. 
[01:28:00]  It's just, you know, you don't want to see it.  When you say politician immediately, I think creepy.  Thank you.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm with Ice-T.  I think lying sack of shit and, yeah, creepy.  Doesn't matter.  I think helpful.  And it doesn't matter what side, so I crossed the board for me.  Hey, Coco's just sitting there looking all beautiful.  Looking all beautiful.  And we got a reality show.  I know.  She loves sitting around the men when we chop it up, you know?  I do.  Yeah, that's how a woman learns.  Like, let the men talk, though.  I'll tell you. 
[01:28:30]  Release a secret.  Oh, here we go.  He could sit here all day and just chat.  I don't think he even knows that he's talking.  I love talking to the homies.  I love when I'm in a room full of real-life cats.  It's fun.  Now, I'm with some squares.  I'm ready to quit.  I'm like, okay, enough talking to you guys.  You're draining my cool.  I got an observation.  I always felt like Ice-T was really scary.  You're really likable.  Well, I'm likable until you cross me.  But this is the first time we've met you. 
[01:29:00]  I mean, what I've seen, like, over the years, I'm like, man, he's intimidating.  I'm not.  But you're a very likable guy, sir.  I think I've lightened him up, too.  Yeah, she'd light me up.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  The most dangerous cats I've ever met are the most likable cats.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  They're the kind of like smile and they laugh with you and show you the pictures of the  kids and they'll take a dinner fork and pull your fucking eye out of you.  You know, it's the guys that act tough all the time.  They're the ones that are insecure and they're trying to show it. 
[01:29:30]  You know, so I'm very calm.  But if there was a problem, you'd be glad I was here.  You feel me?  You know, like, I got that other side.  But people always say that.  They say, well, you're not mean.  I'm like, well, you're not my enemy.  Right.  Yeah.  Why should you be right?  I got to breathe in.  Like Coco said, I got Coco.  What do I got to be mad about?  Right?  Yeah.  Coco, you have a picture taken down recently on TwitPic?  They're always taking pictures down.  This girl knows.  This girl.  Coco knows how to use Twitter.  Yeah.  Her TwitPics are ridiculous.  What was the photo they took down? 
[01:30:00]  Well, just recently I balanced a can on my butt.  And it was in a thong because, you know, if you follow me on my Twitter, I do thong Thursdays.  At Coco's World.  At Titty Tuesdays.  So you get both T and A.  If you're not into asses, then you're going to be in boobs.  Either or, you know.  You're like, damn, I got to wait a couple of days.  Yeah, exactly.  What is Wednesday?  Well, it used to be wet Wednesdays, but I can't keep up with it.  I got to do two.  And then it was like Freaky Feet Friday.  So you show like shoes and people that are into shoes. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, foot fetish guys, right?  Foot fetish guys.  Yeah.  Yeah, I tried to do one for Spartacus.  What was that?  Spartacus is a testicle Tuesdays.  My dog.  That's my dog.  He's cute Spartacus on Twitter.  Yeah, and he does testicle Tuesdays.  PETA got at me.  What?  Because they're like, you know, we want you to be the face of PETA along with Pamela Anderson  and Charlize Theron, blah, blah, blah.  And they're like, can you please neuter Spartacus?  No way.  Because, you know, that causes diseases in their lifetime, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[01:31:00]  And I'm like, you know, I'm trying to breed this little guy, you know?  I want to know what guy can ever cut another thing's nuts off.  Yeah.  You know, I don't care what you're talking about.  I just, I think the voodoo of that.  There's got to be some kind of karma that goes with that.  Yeah, we love his balls.  But you know what?  To go back to my thong Thursday, I get upset that, okay, people can have nude pictures up.  You're not like, you know, I need to have nude pictures up.  Funnel nudity.  You know, but then I have a thong on, you know, which I'm usually in when I'm on the beach. 
[01:31:30]  So it's not even anything outrageous.  And they take them down.  Like, literally, I was balancing.  And actually, they were booty shorts that looked like thongs, to tell you the truth.  But I was balancing a can on my ass.  And by the way, my mother took the picture.  See, the story goes, it's Wednesday night.  So it's Wednesday night.  And I go, geez, Mom, we're eating pizza on the counter.  Geez, I don't have thong Thursday picture.  I don't know what I'm going to do.  You know, I try to be funny. 
[01:32:00]  And she's like, oh, well, you know, I'll get a camera.  I'll take the picture.  And I'm like, well, I want to do something funny.  I look around the room.  I look down.  I see a Sprite can.  I was like, let me try to balance this on my ass.  I've never tried it before.  People had asked me to do it.  But I've never tried it before.  So I slotted down.  She got the camera.  Yeah.  And I actually can do it.  Now it's a trend.  Now every world, TMZ picked up on that.  And everybody, all girls are now trying to balance the can on their ass. 
[01:32:30]  We're doing TV interviews and people are like, well, you think Coco would balance the can?  No, no, dumbass.  No.  That was just one night.  Her and her mother is stupid.  I never saw that photo.  Not that I'm really hoping we could see it.  I'm going to put it back up.  I got a new Who Say page.  If you guys know what a Who Say page is, it's just for celebrities and athletes who can actually  put anything they want on, yeah, up on there.  Oh, wow.  That's handy.  So I'm going to repost it soon.  It's the famous picture.  I think so far that's been your most famous picture.  Why can't we do it today?  I know. 
[01:33:00]  I'm not wearing the right stuff.  We have someone that works for the show that loves Coco's ass.  Oh.  I'm going to guess it's either Danny or Mars.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, there it go to picture.  Oh, there it is.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  There it is.  It's on television.  Wait, where is it?  Where did that come in?  That's Apple TV.  That's CNN.  Oh, Apple TV.  It's a national situation.  It is.  Apple TV.  It's Apple TV.  We just popped it up for you.  Travis is amazing in there.  Danny and Mars especially love Coco's ass. 
[01:33:30]  Holy shit.  I've never looked because she's a married woman, but I'm here.  It's very lovely.  None of us are complaining about it.  Trust me.  But Danny and Mars especially love it.  Take it enough.  That is a nice get up.  Coco, your ass said, wow.  And that's not showing too much.  Honestly, guys.  No.  It's not bad.  I mean.  They should have taken that down.  I got to tell you.  Twitter is afraid of booty.  Your ass comes up in discussion a lot on the show.  Really?  As the go-to ass.  Yeah.  Really?  It's the go-to ass.  It's funny, Coco, though, when we got together, a lot of women are like, mom, she has a fake 
[01:34:00]  ass.  And I'm like, fake ass?  We never even heard of fake ass before, right?  She's like, yo, I got breast implants.  That's cool.  But a fake butt?  And I told her, I said, well, just take that as a compliment.  They just look at it like it's impossible.  It could be real.  But it's real.  I would have blown out any type of anything that was back in it was fake.  And I'm a brother.  I mean, I could go with the booze, but I need real meat.  Can we talk about the fake ass for a second?  Is that possible?  Wouldn't it be a pain in the neck to sit the fuck down? 
[01:34:30]  No, it is possible.  People are actually doing it.  I've actually seen it, touched it, and everything.  Is it uncomfortable to sit down?  Well, that's the thing.  Okay, I might be a hypocrite when I say this.  But yes, I got my boobs enhanced at 18 years old.  I'm against the button clamps.  And people go, well, you did that.  Why would you be against that?  But seriously, think about it.  I'm not sitting on my chest.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like your butt is the main key on your body.  You're constantly doing something with your legs.  And I've seen a lot go wrong. 
[01:35:00]  I've seen one droop down.  Yeah, it doesn't seem like it could be as natural looking.  But they got the implants in there.  They got the shots or whatever.  It's just nasty.  They're creepy looking.  They don't look just something off about them.  I mean, what I say.  Well, you don't bang, you know, I mean, you don't, I don't, you know, bang your boobs.  I bang your ass.  You know what I'm saying?  Now, it's good to have some meat back there because I don't want to break a pelvis or anything when I'm in motion.  Some padding, right?  Right.  That's what it tells me.  Ice-T is an animal. 
[01:35:30]  I'm a man.  Oh, yeah.  I can't even tear that shit up.  Yeah, well, we have this thing, we have this thing that people have been asking us how we keep our relationship together.  And we have this thing that we call the sexual code.  Okay.  And I think every man, every woman has a sexual code.  Now, the code is whatever it takes to turn you the fuck on.  Okay.  It might mean you might need to see a girl in a wetsuit and figure skates.  I don't know what the code is.  The question is, are you willing to tell the code, and are they willing to accommodate the code? 
[01:36:00]  And we all have a code, you know?  And the thing of it is, usually when you're just dating, you're afraid to tell the code because it might be a little too kinky.  Right, right.  But once you understand the code, it's going to be good.  And it could be a bunch of codes.  It doesn't have to just be one.  It could be a bunch of codes.  It could be a long list of codes.  Could you give us one of your codes?  Yes, Jimmy.  I like when I'm having sex with a girl, and she talks about how she's fucked guys who are better fucks than I am and have bigger dicks than I do. 
[01:36:30]  And that turns you to fuck off.  Well, it's such an easy thing to find.  But yeah, I like the humiliation of it because I'm so jaded after all these years of porn.  It's like I'm so numb.  I like two girls, but I would rather hear about her telling me how she would rather be fucking somebody other than me because that's taboo.  And that just makes you explode, the three-way orgasm where you fart and you cum and you get a headache. 
[01:37:00]  If she says it right, it becomes the four-way because I shit as well.  I talked about the three-way one time on Twitter, and people were like, are you what, a headache?  And then some people was like, man, I know what that one is.  When you really think you're going to die.  When you're extremely, you're like, ah, wow, I love you.  Another code.  Some gasket's going to blow somewhere, right?  Toes are about to pop off like rockets.  Today is code Friday. 
[01:37:30]  I like, if body scent is good, I like no deodorant.  I like a little smell under the arms.  That can be very sexy.  See, look, I think you might have hit one of Coco's toes.  A Coco likes that.  I don't need deodorant.  As long as the chemistry's good.  The body chemistry.  The chemistry, yeah.  That's nature telling you that you should be or you shouldn't be.  I gave up one of my codes.  I go into stalker mode right before we get home.  So, like, right before we get ready to come in.  We've been out all night.  Then I'll say, walk in front of me.  She walks.  I let her open the door.  He wants to be like he doesn't know me. 
[01:38:00]  I want to be behind her and follow her into the house and kind of like, you know, because  I want, because you got to think, when you're with your girl all night, you don't really  get to see her because she's right with you.  Everyone else gets to admire her.  So, I'm like, just walk ahead and you walk into the door and then I come through the door  and I'm evil Mick, you know.  Yeah.  I'm that guy.  Yeah.  You get to be creepy at the party for a minute.  I get to be creepy at the party to follow their home.  Exactly.  And that's, it works for me.  That works.  That's just one of the many codes of the ice. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah, there are many codes.  They can be physical too, but for me, they're more mental because you can't create.  It's usually mental.  You're more mental.  But then also with your girl, they have to find out the code and they have to work on  it and work on it to become the best at it so you don't look anywhere else.  By the way, when is your show on?  It's Sunday night.  Yeah, you just sold the show.  You just sold the show.  Absolutely.  Everyone is screaming, what is Coco's Twitter?  It's Coco's World.  It's Coco's World.  Go check it out.  For the losers out there, you can follow me, which is Final Level. 
[01:39:00]  F-I-N-A-L-L-E-V-E.  One on Ice-T.  Who has it?  There was some gay dude in Arizona that had Ice-T.  Really?  Yeah, when I went on Twitter.  I mean, I didn't go on Twitter.  I wasn't the first person.  So I went there and there's some guy on there saying like Ice-T stuff like, I'm cool.  Keep it hip.  And I'm like, all right, you can just have that world.  If you want to be me so bad, fuck you.  But I'll, I'll, I'll, and my production company is called Final Level Entertainment, Final Level Productions.  Okay.  I think we're all trying to get to the final level.  Plus, I'm a gamer. 
[01:39:30]  And that's what we try.  So I just said, well, there's a chance.  So I promote myself and my.  What's your game?  I play Call of Duty.  Right now, I'm a character in the new Gears of War 3.  I love Gears of War.  I play a character named Griffin.  That's coming out.  That's the, that, that, talk about money.  Now, I didn't get any of this money.  I just got paid to be in the show.  This, this game has sold over a million pre-sales at about a hundred bucks a pop.  It is amazing.  There's some game franchises where, like Call of Duty, that are just instant money makers. 
[01:40:00]  It's amazing.  Rockstar Games that put out all the Grand Theft Auto.  I was in Grand Theft Auto.  I was in, yeah.  So were we.  Yeah.  In 4, in Red Dead Redemption.  You guys were?  Yeah.  I'm the guy.  I know these guys pretty well.  I sell the guns in the gun store.  I'm the, I'm the main guy at, I'm the last guy in San Andreas, wasn't he?  Right.  Yeah.  San Andreas.  Oh, yeah.  I was, I was the Cracked Out.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's Mad Dog.  Mad Dog.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, in this one, in this one, I'm Griffin, and I also did a body count song for the game, 
[01:40:30]  for the horde mode.  That's cool, man.  Yeah.  Hey, we're all together there in the games.  That's it, man.  Hell yeah.  Love gaming, man.  They're cursing all the time with these goddamn little bastards shooting me, knifing me.  Yeah.  I hate those son of a bitches with the knife come around, you're all, you know, armed for  bear, and you're going out there, you got your good weapon, and you just hear, and you  just see some asshole running away from you.  I hate that.  He's a gamer.  God, I hate that.  He's a gamer. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, yeah.  She loves the fact I game.  She, you know, a lot of women don't like the fact their men game.  Coco has a great answer for it.  She goes, at least you know where they are.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's true.  And if you've seen a lot of female gamers, you ain't trying to hook up with them.  That's for sure.  Yeah.  I'm talking to Fat Pig, 1520.  No, they're not exactly attractive.  Well, they're saying you guys got stuff to do.  Yeah, they're busy today, man.  Ice Team Coco, yeah.  This is a great interview.  We've been pissed. 
[01:41:30]  A lot of interviews, they'll be like, nice, you're a rapper.  Coco, you've done a lot of modeling.  Thank you.  Good.  Nice meeting you guys.  Fuck that.  We like hanging and talking.  Believe me, if you guys were able to come in earlier, we'd have loved to talk to you more.  We'll come back.  And we would love to have you back.  Please come back.  Absolutely.  After you guys see the show.  Yeah, after you see the show.  And Coco's got to come in with the proper attire for an ass shot.  Yeah.  Yeah, we've got to get an ass shot in here.  I think if she did it for anybody, she'd do it for this show.  Would you do it for us next time?  Yeah, totally.  I'll do that.  And I would love to talk some old school shit with you.  You know, NWA, all that era. 
[01:42:00]  That era, it fascinates me.  Go to YouTube and hit The Art of Rap, and you'll see the trailer for my movie.  It'll be what you want to see.  Fantastic.  Yeah.  When is that coming out?  It'll be out this summer.  It's editing right now.  Oh, okay.  So it's close.  Good.  Yeah, it'll be out this summer.  But I can't.  I mean, I've got so much stuff, I only can promote one thing at a time.  No, you're a busy guy, man.  Come back when that's ready.  Okay.  Absolutely.  Listen, but they're promoting their reality show, Ice Loves Cocoa, Baby Got Backstory,  premieres Sunday, 1030 on E. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah, right after the Kardashians, right?  The Baby Got Backstory, that was the preview.  They've already shown that.  Okay.  It's just Ice Loves Cocoa.  Okay.  And it's a spin on I Love Lucy.  Right.  That's what it is.  Oh, nice.  A little different, though, huh?  Yeah, a little bit.  You guys are sleeping in the same bed.  Yeah, and Lucy can balance the cans.  We've been seeing that.  All right, guys.  This was a pleasure.  See you Monday weekend.  Absolutely.  Blah, blah, blah.  This is the worst of the O.P. and Anthony Show.  We've got Elijah Wood outside the studio.  Bring him in. 
[01:43:00]  Elijah.  Just met him literally a minute ago.  What's up?  How are you, sir?  Good to see you.  I'm very well.  Yeah.  Busy?  Have they got you all over the place?  Not so bad.  Really?  Not too bad?  No, not so bad.  You've got to be used to this by now.  Yeah.  Jesus.  He's like, yeah.  Amazing.  Yeah, a little bit.  I know.  We were just, what were we just watching?  That's Jimmy.  O.P.  Yeah.  That's me.  We were watching.  Travis.  Don't dump.  What's up, Travis?  I like the way he looked at Travis, and you only introduced Travis out of obligation, 
[01:43:30]  which I kind of like.  Because he was in my line of view, and it's like, ah.  I know we're going to talk about Wilford.  Are you the whipping boy, Travis?  Yes.  Okay.  I'm getting the order of.  Yeah.  Okay.  We're going to talk about Wilford in a second.  Yeah.  But quickly, we were just talking about you coming in and stuff, and we saw a scene from  The Good Son.  Yeah.  We forgot you were in that.  Yeah.  Because you've been around forever.  Yeah.  And you were Macaulay Culkin's brother in that, right?  The victim.  Cousin.  Cousin or something?  The victim.  Yeah.  That was horrible. 
[01:44:00]  And you guys are throwing the dummy over the overpass.  That's brutal, man.  It was a real, like, brutal movie.  It's kind of an intense scene.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, it's all, like, small stuff right before that.  And then they throw the body over, and you're like, whoa.  Yeah.  And Macaulay's all, like, into it and everything.  Really.  Because it goes from smoking cigarettes to creating car accidents.  Yeah.  Stuff that a lot of us can relate to.  Maybe throwing snowballs at cars or something.  Or shooting bolt guns.  Yeah.  Next thing you know, you're throwing a dummy into traffic.  What the hell?  How did you make that transition from, like, really, you were a child, child actor into, 
[01:44:30]  you know, you're doing roles now.  They're adult roles.  They have been for a while now.  Do you remember when that transition happened?  Or did it seem natural?  Or was it like, hey, look, I'm doing adult roles?  I don't know if it, yeah.  I mean, it's just one of those things where I just continued to work.  So I don't know if there was, like, one film that did it.  Or if there were a series of films that just suddenly were more adult.  Do you remember the first movie you did, though, where you were like, okay, I'm not really 
[01:45:00]  playing, like, the little kid here.  Although even as a kid you played...  I would have said The Ice Storm would have been a transitional film.  Because that was like, it was a teenage role, but it was such a, this subject matter was  so adult.  Yeah.  You know what it is with your whole career, too, though?  Even as a kid, you weren't playing, like, kid roles.  They were, like, some of those movies.  Radio Flyer was insanely intense to watch.  Yeah.  That was a good movie.  You know, that was one of those, like, holy Jesus, this one's...  Yeah.  There was always some sort of maturity to either the subject matter or to the characters. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, except maybe Back to the Future, too.  Right.  Okay, that one, just a kid playing a game.  Right.  I love that one.  It's like, hey, look, there he is.  Playing a video game.  That was the first movie I was ever in.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that was...  What was that?  What year was it?  God, in 89?  Yeah, probably 89.  Something like that.  That's a hell of a start.  Yeah, I know, right?  Jesus.  Yeah, that's a good one.  It was so awesome, because I had to get that.  Spielberg see and just go, ah, yeah, he fits the bill for a Spielberg kid. 
[01:46:00]  I just auditioned.  It was the tiniest little role, so I just auditioned for it.  Yeah, it was nuts being on that set, having seen the original film, and then being there  in the future.  It blew my mind.  I don't even know how I could process that.  It was so awesome.  What did you just start doing commercials, I guess?  Yeah.  What was the first one?  My very first job was a Paula Abdul music video.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  It was for Forever Your Girl.  You rock.  You rock, who loves Paula Abdul. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah, he's a big...  The guy in the booth.  Oh, he's right here.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, he's over here today.  Hey, what's up?  I didn't see him in the studio.  Do you remember him in Paula Abdul's video?  Now that he said it, yes.  Yeah?  Yeah.  It was that Black and White video.  David Fincher, funnily enough, directed that.  Wow.  Before he started making movies.  Eric's very strange.  He likes Paula Abdul and Weird Al Yankovic.  That's his music.  That's your jam?  Those are your jams?  That's his jam.  You get in the car for a road trip, and it's like...  Making mixtapes for chicks. 
[01:47:00]  Cold-hearted snake style.  Good for Elijah.  Beat him up.  Yeah, exactly.  Even he hates you.  Trust me, he deserves it.  So, doing TV, that's kind of new, though, for you, right?  Totally.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  And from what I've heard from actors, it is a totally different vibe doing it.  Do you like it?  Yeah.  I mean, the pace is so much faster.  Yeah.  We shot 13 episodes in 10 weeks.  We were doing, like, 8 to 10 pages a day. 
[01:47:30]  Some is, like, as many as 6 or 7 scenes a day.  It was a lot.  It was just a faster pace.  That was, like, one...  The whole thing is, like, one...  It takes the time of one take in Lord of the Rings, I'm sure.  Right.  It was just, like, as long as it takes to do an entire series.  Yeah.  Much different pacing.  We should talk about Wilford, though.  You want to tell the people what it's about?  Yeah.  It's a weird show.  Yeah.  It really is.  It is.  It's a weird show, and it's not easily defined.  I mean, it's essentially about a guy who befriends his neighbor's dog, but he sees the dog as a man in a dog suit. 
[01:48:00]  And we find my character, Ryan, in a moment of crisis.  He's essentially trying to commit suicide.  Hilarious.  And he fails and wakes up the next morning, or doesn't wake up, because he doesn't go to sleep.  And he gets a knock on his door from his neighbor, and his neighbor's like, can you look after my dog?  Reveal, man in dog suit.  And sort of from there on out, you know, he spends the next day trying to figure out what the hell's going on. 
[01:48:30]  And then ultimately, at the end of the episode, sort of accepts this person, dog, in his life,  and recognizes that nobody else sees him, only he does.  And it's going to be some kind of coping mechanism for him.  But everybody recognizes the dog as a dog.  As a dog.  It's not an invisible friend.  It really is.  People, chicks react to it like a dog.  Yes.  And the guy, the dog is just a pig, which is great.  That's exactly what he does.  He puts his face in tits.  I mean, there's some really funny scenes.  Yeah, the scene with the waitress is hilarious. 
[01:49:00]  And there's one scene, I don't remember, I used to watch all three.  I watched all three.  Yeah, yeah, the dog's always stoned.  I like the fact that Sean did on FX.  The dog is always high.  FX is great, man.  The language is great.  You don't miss the word fuck.  You don't realize it.  It just feels like an HBO show.  Yeah.  With the language.  And the dog is really, what's he fucking, the big stuffed animal in one of them?  It's hilarious.  Because he keeps turning the stuffed animal.  There's so much more of that as the series goes.  He develops a very intense relationship with that stuffed animal. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, I think that made me, I was watching it last night.  I got my thing late.  Going cum stains on the...  He's talking about how much he likes eating out the asshole of a possum.  Yeah, some really funny things.  You kind of love FX, man.  Yeah.  That's why they're kicking ass on the networks and everything.  Because it's real language.  You don't have to sit there and go, oh, really?  You're spoon-feeding this to the children.  And they take risks.  I mean, the concept of the show is strange.  It's weird.  It's very surreal.  It's not easily defined. 
[01:50:00]  And, you know, they gave us full creative control to make the show we wanted to make  and not have to pander it to an audience to explain too much.  Because we don't explain a lot.  Right.  Yeah, it's like, why is this happening?  It's like, whatever.  Never explain it.  We're hoping for it.  Me and Jimmy are hoping for some kind of reveal eventually.  I'm sure it'll happen.  As time goes on, you'll learn more.  But I feel like there's something we don't know.  Yeah.  And you get that feeling watching it, like there is more to this.  There's something deeper going on here.  And he obviously wants to hook up with the dog's owner, who's this beautiful girl.  Right. 
[01:50:30]  And the dog is kind of cock-blocking, which is great.  It's very funny.  The cock-blocks the dog throws.  That's actually how the whole thing started.  Jason Gann, who created the character of Wilfred, it initially started as a short film.  And he was stoned with a friend of his, and they were talking about how their female friend had a dog that was cock-blocking her, like, prospective boyfriends, and, like, giving the boyfriend shit.  And so he created this sort of humanized version of that dog, what Wilfred stoned. 
[01:51:00]  And they were like, wait, this is a really good idea for a short film.  Well, there's one scene, I don't want to give away punchlines, but there's a very funny scene where the dog tells his character that she has a flaw.  And he's like, I don't want to say what it is.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  And, um, the dog says, uh...  The dog's an asshole.  I'll say, it's only one line in one of the episodes, but the dog says, uh, the dog is getting anesthesia or whatever, and he goes, oh, she's passing out.  He's passing out, and the dog says, she has a dick.  And then passes out. 
[01:51:30]  It's fucking funny, man.  It was just, it was really great.  They didn't soften it up and make it dog dialogue.  The dog is, like, really an asshole friend who does dog things.  Yes, and you only remember he's a dog when he talks about chewing the asshole out of a possum, or he's humping somebody, or somebody's reacting and petting him.  There's a very funny scene where he takes the dog to the beach, and the dog's just being a total douche on the beach.  There's a lot of really, really funny, funny scenes, and it is bizarre, so it's engaging to watch, because you're like, you don't understand what this relationship is, but it's funny. 
[01:52:00]  How'd you get into this?  I read the script.  I always sent the script.  I was reading a couple of different television scripts, just kind of interested in television.  It's changed so much, you know, in the last five years.  It's definitely more acceptable and accepted to get into.  It's that, and it's also some incredible directors and writers and actors have moved to television, and it's an interesting medium now for storytelling, in some ways, you know, more consistent than film, in a way. 
[01:52:30]  And so I was just interested to see what was available.  I'd never really taken a look at it, and this was one of the scripts that I read.  And a lot of, it seems like...  The funniest thing I'd ever read, really.  A lot of, like you just said, a lot of people that probably would have been shut out of TV 15 years ago, because NBC, CBS, ABC, or whatever, the few networks use these writers in the same fucking cornball, you know, beginning, middle, and end to an episode, and now all these creative people have other outlets.  Like, you couldn't...  You might be able to do this show on a network, but it wouldn't be as funny, because half the jokes wouldn't be able to play.  Yeah, you're totally right. 
[01:53:00]  They would have to cuten it up.  Yeah, you would be so initiatized, you know?  Yeah, the suicide attempt, they would be like, I don't know if we should...  It's too dark.  Yeah, it's too dark, and we don't want to show sadness, and we, you know...  And we don't want to offend people, and...  Right, because, you know, making mockery of him taking a bunch of pills, and it's just great.  It's just great.  His fucking sister's annoying, and always yelling at him, and he's kind of hot.  Fucking...  His neighbor's a fucking complete...  It's a very funny scene where he hangs out with the neighbor, and they porn out to watch hardcore porn again.  It's some funny shit, man. 
[01:53:30]  Fucking...  It's really kind of a weird homoerotic relationship with the neighbor, and...  But the neighbor's not gay, he's just creepy and fucking invasive.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's a lot of very, very funny...  That's great.  ...funny things with the...  But the dog just sets him up to get fucked every time.  Metaphorically, you know, the dog sets him up to have problems.  It's like a really weird, aggressive relationship.  Like, the dog loves him, but also wants to see him just be ruined.  Just fail.  Yeah.  Like, the dog talks him into shitting into the neighbor's boots.  There's a lot of very, very funny things.  I won't give any more away, but you gotta...  It's worth watching. 
[01:54:00]  It's a very...  Dude, they got...  It's a very strange show, Elijah.  Dude, they did that in the fucking...  In the pilot episode where the dog shits in the neighbor's boots, and he's like,  well, come on, there's one more.  And he talks him into shitting into the neighbor's boot.  Like, what a great thing to put in a fucking pilot.  And Elijah's character enjoyed it.  Yeah.  He was very happy.  The dog kind of frees him in a way from being this really sad guy.  The dog is kind of a balance.  Well, see, that's the whole point behind any of those things.  Like, there are these ridiculous scenarios that Wilfred tries to put him into that are 
[01:54:30]  seemingly harmful to the character.  But ultimately, what they're about is getting Ryan to live outside of his comfort zone.  Because he's...  What led him to suicide was essentially, like, living a path that was not his own.  His sister told him what to do.  His dad told him what to do.  And he ceased to, like, follow his own path.  Right.  And Wilfred's like, fuck that.  Shit in the boot.  Yeah.  Basically.  Steal the guy's pot.  You know, the guy had big pot plants.  But there's a lot of drug jokes.  Like, you know, I like the fact that they're smoking pot and it's like, they're not sanitizing 
[01:55:00]  it like television would do.  And that to me is what...  And it's on right before Louie.  Louie's show is incredible.  Yeah.  Yeah, it is.  Very good.  It's fucking...  You know, he's brilliant.  I mean...  Incredible.  I mean, that first season, it was so interesting.  Because it sort of found its legs three or four episodes in.  Yeah.  And just became something wholly unto its own.  Like, indescribable.  Nothing like it on television.  Yeah.  And this new season, I saw the first episode from the new season.  And it's fucking incredible.  Yeah.  Well, that's what makes FX great, is they let Louie...  Because he knows what he's doing. 
[01:55:30]  He has full control on the show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Amazing, right?  But he was ready to walk.  He's like, nah, I just didn't do it that way.  I want to do it this way.  And they gave it to him.  Yeah.  He wants to edit, direct, write, everything.  He's literally writing it as he goes along.  Yeah.  He doesn't have to submit scripts.  We know Louie pretty well.  It's amazing.  I know.  He comes in a lot.  Yeah.  He's a great guy.  He's got to have photos of FX executives.  Absolutely.  What's that?  He wouldn't even show the executives the finished product.  No.  He goes, don't you worry, I will deliver, and then you'll see it for the first time.  It's a real credit to FX.  They decided to go for it.  Yes, it is.  Yeah. 
[01:56:00]  And the fact is, they said it's not a tremendously expensive show to do.  That's why Louie...  There's so much money wasted in television, and the fact that Louie knows how to do it.  He's been doing home movies, like these little shorts for a year, at the comic strip parties  fucking 15 years ago.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he'd be showing these little weird videos he made.  Louie was always the guy doing that.  And nice, it pays off.  He certainly did for him.  He's so funny.  Easily one of the best stand-ups in the background.  Yeah, he's great.  He's absolutely great.  Extraordinary.  I want to ask you about doing Lord of the Rings. 
[01:56:30]  It took how many years to film all those?  It was four years?  Four years.  Yeah.  Wow.  You were pretty much...  60 months of actual being in New Zealand for a block of time.  Yeah.  That's a lot of time.  Now, obviously, it worked out pretty well.  I mean, very successful movies.  Would you ever commit to that much time again?  Because it seems like a lot of career time.  And it is kind of a gamble, not knowing if it's going to pay off. 
[01:57:00]  But, you know, you're out of the loop for a while.  Yeah.  It was never anything I was worried about or considered.  I mean, I think I recognized the fact that they were essentially setting out to make the Lord of the Rings,  which is an incredible series of books, and it was going to be unprecedented.  And the fact that Peter Jackson was directing it, I never really thought twice about it.  Really?  It was such an incredible opportunity.  I knew, regardless of how it ended up being received and turned out, 
[01:57:30]  I knew it was going to be a unique experience for me and a sort of defining experience either way.  And it turned out to be fantastic.  Amazing, yeah.  And the films are great.  But it was just, I was 18 at the time, and it was the most incredible opportunity I'd ever had.  So it was just, there was no question in my mind that it was something that I...  Now, would I take a similar kind of...  It really depends.  Yeah.  I think it would depend on the filmmaker and ultimately what the material is. 
[01:58:00]  But that was a very special circumstance.  Not like four years on doing, like, Smokey and the Bandit 4.  You'd say, like, no.  No.  But it was a special circumstance, you know.  The whole thing felt extremely unique and, like, being given an opportunity to take an adventure, you know.  When I watched, because I watched every bit of the DVDs, the making of, all the behind-the-scenes stuff with Weta and everything.  A lot of footage there.  Oh, my God.  I was like, all right, already, Anthony, what are you doing? 
[01:58:30]  Like, ah, I'm almost done.  Another three DVDs, and I'm done.  But just an amazing amount of work that went into that.  And it really is the only way it could have come out that way.  Yeah.  When you look at a book like that, or a series of books like that, and realize somebody's going to try to make a movie out of it, you really got to go, yeah?  Because that, it seems impossible.  But, yeah, he really pulled that off.  Yeah.  Amazingly.  Yeah.  It was a pretty extraordinary feat. 
[01:59:00]  You know, when you consider how many people were involved in the making of it, too.  And, like, the ultimate collective effort it took, it was just mind-blowing.  Like, down to the guy, like, making the chain mail, like, sitting in a room.  Yeah, that's it.  Like, all the authentic costumes that went into it.  Blacksmiths that were making swords.  Yeah, real blacksmiths that made the swords and everything.  Yeah.  He really wanted that accurately.  It was a sort of Herculean effort.  But it also felt like it couldn't have been done anywhere else, and I think we were all very aware of that at the time. 
[01:59:30]  Like, if it had been done in the United States, it probably would have been double the money, and the atmosphere surrounding it wouldn't have felt the same.  It really felt like a family effort.  Even though it was this massive film, it's so funny talking to people about it, because they're like, you know, you're used to huge films.  Like, yeah, it was huge.  But it also felt like the world's largest independent film.  It was very much a local family effort in this small country.  And we felt very tucked away from Hollywood and the rest of the world, in our own little world, making this, you know, Middle Earth come to life. 
[02:00:00]  Did you spend a lot of time with them?  Did you see the Maoris, I'm sure, when you were there, right?  Oh, yeah.  Did you ever see Once for Warriors?  Oh, dude, the movie's incredible.  It's fucking amazing, right?  Amazing.  Great flick about New Zealand and the alcoholism and the Maoris.  It's fucking...  Really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But it's about one family being broke.  But I always think of that when I think of New Zealand.  That's all I know about New Zealand.  So I just wanted to interrupt with my bit of knowledge.  Just bringing nothing to the conversation except just getting my voice on the radio. 
[02:00:30]  It's a really powerful film.  Oh, fuck, man.  It's almost like the Native American experience here, to a certain degree.  Yeah, he's a big soap star over there, the guy who played Jake the Muss.  And there's certain things in the book that happened that he wouldn't do.  So they had to change it and put Uncle Bully in.  Interesting.  Well, you know, it's 1994.  I'm acting like a big spoiler alert.  But, you know, the fucking...  The daughter is raped.  I'm 13.  She's raped by the uncle.  But in the book, I think it's Jake who rips her. 
[02:01:00]  But...  Oh, wow.  All right.  I just figured I'd completely destroy the conversation.  I did enjoy Wilford a lot, though.  I did.  Yeah, Wilford's going to do all right.  Well, conceptually, it's great.  Yes.  When's the last time you auditioned for anything?  Like, because, you know, you're obviously, they say, offer only.  I mean, you don't have to...  No, I still audition.  Do you really?  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  I auditioned for something the other day.  God, that depresses me.  Because I'm terrible on auditions.  Uh-huh.  And when I get it.  Auditions still make me really nervous.  I'm sure they make everybody else nervous, too, when he walks in. 
[02:01:30]  Nah.  Fuck.  Do you get a call back and he walks in?  Oh, man.  It's either me or Elijah.  Your name is Fred Bentley.  You're from Ohio.  Right.  Or is it going to Elijah or Fred Bentley?  I think I did pretty good.  Walks out.  I think I did pretty good.  Oh, dude.  Fred Bentley's good, man.  You've got to love Fred Bentley.  Check his IMDb.  Hey, it's great.  Yeah.  Wow.  All the roles he almost got.  That's odd that you still get nervous, though.  Oh, totally.  I think I was also out of practice for a while because I wasn't auditioning as much. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  And I'm sort of auditioning more now.  I mean, I think the atmosphere around film has changed a little bit.  And people are auditioning for things when they didn't necessarily used to have to.  I think.  Hmm.  Wow.  I don't know what that's about.  But I have to say, like, auditioning for something and feeling like you've genuinely  earned it, it means more.  It feels like an actual achievement.  Oh, then if you just get tossed the role because of who you are.  Totally.  Past work.  Yeah.  Totally.  How do they tell? 
[02:02:30]  Is it awkward for them to ask you to read for something?  Like, you know, we know he'd probably be great, but we have to ask to.  It is kind of asking somebody to do something.  I shan't.  A lot of guys will, I'm sure.  Yeah.  I guess the only way I would know that is just the atmosphere of going in.  And oftentimes I will say, like, I'll do a reading and they'll be very thankful.  I'm like, no, thank you for having me.  It's not a big deal to come in.  Thank you enough for coming in.  I'm trying to get a job here. 
[02:03:00]  It's my job.  Yeah.  That's what I'm supposed to do.  That's real fame right there.  Does your agent bring you stuff?  Or will they say, look, we'd love Elijah to read for this?  Would he be willing to come in and read?  Do they send you, like, scripts and go, would he read?  That's great.  Yeah.  Because my agent will call, my manager will call, do you want to go in and try?  Should I try to get you in for this?  The last audition I did wasn't good.  Did you bomb?  Fucking horrible.  It was for him.  What happened?  It was, well.  It's an awful feeling, isn't it?  It certainly is.  It was for the. 
[02:03:30]  You walk out and you're like, ah, I just missed.  No.  It was for the Alec Baldwin, Meryl Streep movie, which to me did not look appealing.  And the role that I was reading for, I was wrong for.  But I was like, it's Meryl Streep.  You have to read.  It's like, but it was for the hotel doctor.  And I'm like, do you fuck it for my manager?  I'm like, I'm not a hotel doctor.  You fucking.  And I go in and I'm so bad.  I'm just disastrous.  And the girl is sick.  First of all, it's hard to get on camera, as you know.  It's harder if the producers are in the room, but on camera is fucking horrible.  Yeah. 
[02:04:00]  And I'm bombing.  Mr. Faber-Sham.  Dude, I wasn't even that good.  I would have been better if I went, no.  I was fucking.  And I said, I'm like, I stopped.  I'm like, look, can we just restart this?  And she goes, no, no, no.  Just keep going.  We'll piece it together.  Meaning, get the hell out.  Meaning, you've wasted enough of my time already.  But I couldn't even be mad at her because I was giving an abominable read.  She did what she should have done.  I was wasting her time.  Yeah, she let you off the hook.  She fucking ushered me out.  I was doing you a favor.  Just finish so we can get you out of here. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Get you out of here, Miss Green.  The hotel doctor.  Yeah, I never should have read for that.  I should have just said no.  Hey, I want to ask Elijah about Victoria Falls, which has nothing to do with acting and stuff.  But you went across that in ropes?  Yes.  And you were the first person to do this?  Apparently, yeah.  What does that mean?  You remember Jack Osborne's show, Adrenaline Junkie?  I know.  He was on it, and he did.  It's a stunt, really.  Yeah.  Yeah, he had that show, which I think he still does, where he basically has people go to different 
[02:05:00]  parts of the world, and they basically do sort of like adrenaline activities.  And he asked me to come down to Africa, so it was an awesome...  I've never been to Africa before.  And one of the activities that we did was they pulled a line across the Victoria Falls.  There's a giant gorge.  And we basically harnessed ourselves in and pulled ourselves across.  Holy crap.  It was amazing.  How high up were you?  I don't actually remember.  I mean, like, you weren't 20 feet off the line.  You were high.  I was high.  It was actually the part of the season there where there's... 
[02:05:30]  It's the lowest water, like, it's not a tide, but the lowest amount of water coming off  of the falls.  Oh, wow.  So we could actually stand on the falls.  It was mind-blowing.  And pulling ourselves across...  It wasn't harrowing in like a bungee jumping kind of way.  In fact, in some ways, I wasn't even nervous.  It was adrenalizing, kind of pulling myself out there and just looking at the vista.  And I ended up just sitting there and taking photos the whole time. 
[02:06:00]  Wow, you stopped in the middle and took pictures?  That's cool.  It was fucking awesome.  Then again, if you've seen Cliffhanger, there's no guarantees.  I mean, fucking equipment breaks.  Yeah.  Great scene, right?  I think I'm far too trusting.  Yeah, yeah.  I didn't even really consider those options.  Yeah.  Isn't that great when she's fucking hanging there and Stallone grabs her and there's a  great shot of the canyon?  Oh, yeah.  Couldn't hold on.  I did a Gortz swing, too.  Have you guys ever done a bungee jump or anything like that?  No, no.  No bungee jumping.  No.  Skydive. 
[02:06:30]  My girlfriend and I fought because he's in Vegas.  We fought because I didn't want to go up into a 51-story glass elevator because I hate  heights so much.  And she's like, just come on, do it.  I'm like, you go fucking take the elevator.  I'll wait.  And this castrating, rotten monster just screamed at me until I took the elevator.  Fucking horrible.  So I don't know.  I never bungeed.  It scares me.  I want to hear about the swing.  Of course.  Yeah, so the Gortz swing is like a bungee jump except you don't have, you're not on a  bungee.  It's just a normal cable.  And I did it twice, once with Jack. 
[02:07:00]  We did a tandem jump, which, dude, it's like, it's intense enough on your own, but when you've  got double the weight, it's so much faster.  And we did it backwards.  So you're not looking.  No.  But the first time I did it, I'm standing and you're, you know, you're looking at this  giant gorge in front of you and they tell you to jump and everything in your body is  saying, nope, nope, this is, this is death.  This means death.  And you're fought the free fall. 
[02:07:30]  I don't know how many seconds it is, but it feels like an eternity.  It is the most intense feeling and horrifyingly scary.  There it is.  Oh, is this actually you doing it?  There is just footage of me doing it.  There is a guy who's doing a handstand.  I didn't do that.  A handstand is nice.  That's unadvisable.  Oh, gorge jump is.  That's unadvisable, yeah.  Oh, Christ.  Oh, no way.  I would never do that.  Oh, wow.  What's it attached to?  Something going across to the middle?  A cable, yeah.  It's a cable.  So then what happens, why they call it a swing, is basically at the end, it goes taut, 
[02:08:00]  and once it goes taut, it turns into this lovely little swing.  Which is.  And they lower you or raise you back up.  It's a lot of hell to get to a very peaceful thing.  Yeah.  And I immediately felt like I wanted to do it again, and then I regretted it when I  was back, facing my back to the gorge, doing it backwards.  Which is an absolute nightmare.  When you do that, do they lower you into the water when you're done, or do you get pulled  back up?  There was no water below us.  It was just rocks. 
[02:08:30]  But you go to the ground.  Yeah.  Okay.  Because going back up would scare me more.  Really?  Yeah, because you're losing ground.  At least when you're falling, you're getting closer to the ground.  That would scare me more.  See, that's the most dangerous part, though.  No, I know.  Closer to the ground part.  Yeah.  That's scary, man.  Yeah, it was scary.  We also did a two and a half day rafting trip down the Zambezi River, too.  With Jack?  Yeah.  Why does he do that?  Why does he just stay home and just talk to Ozzy all day?  That's what I would do.  That's all I would do, is just talk to Ozzy.  Give me some huge Ozzy fans.  Huge fan of Ozzy.  An adventurer. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  We had Jack in here recently.  He's doing well.  Yeah, I don't know.  He is, isn't he?  Yeah, he is.  It's amazing.  Did you see the documentary so much?  What's that?  The documentary?  Did you see the...  He did one on his father, right?  No, I haven't seen it.  It's fucking great.  Is it?  Jimmy is...  I mean, I'm a huge Sabbath fan.  Yeah, yeah, me too.  I'm fucking consummatazzi.  Jimmy's the biggest Sabbath fan.  No, but I wouldn't have brought it up unless he mentioned Jack.  But it's amazing.  A guy with such a great career, and by me and you, would take these chances to...  Well, he wants to live. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, I know.  Yeah.  It sounds like he likes a little adventure.  Just stay in front of the cameras all the time.  Right.  That's it.  No, no, I'm not saying you don't live and enjoy life, but I would never.  Did you get the bug for adventure filming in New Zealand?  Because they're all about that.  They are.  They have a lot of bungee jumps and, you know, gorge swings and all that stuff.  Yeah, I did some of that there, but I didn't do a bungee jump.  They also do, you know, you can jump out of planes and stuff there, too.  I didn't do a lot of that.  They have this thing down in Queenstown.  It's like a jet boat. 
[02:10:00]  It's a very fast jet boat that they drive around in these sort of like little rivers.  And it's very frightening, and you get very close to the rocks, like dangerously close.  That sounds creepy.  Yeah.  I did that.  No, thank you.  No, thank you.  No adventure for you.  No.  I like being out there, but nah, that's too fast.  I'm just.  Would you do that?  Nah.  The jet boat in the river with the rocks flying by your face?  I'm a car guy. 
[02:10:30]  I'll do things in cars, but I won't.  I did that in New Zealand.  There was a.  Yeah.  What is it where it's off-road?  With off-road racing?  What is that called?  Rally cars?  Yeah.  Yeah, they do rally cars, like doing the Baja down in Mexico.  That kind of thing.  I got to do a ride in a rally car, and that was the most intense experience.  Yeah, they'll shake your kidneys out of you.  Well, dude, the thing that blew my mind was how much control they have, but how it feels  like you're out of control the entire time.  Yeah, yeah.  Like you're, it's all about the skid, and you know, we were near like the edge of cliffs, 
[02:11:00]  and the guy had control, but it literally felt like it was constantly just out of control.  I'm sure if you got behind the wheel, it wouldn't be as in control.  That's how I was feeling.  That is correct.  That's how I felt, yeah, I did the NASCAR thing over at Pocono Raceway, where you go  around with an instructor, and kind of get the feel of the car, and then they put you  in the driver's seat, and you take one out at like 140 miles an hour, 150, and when you're 
[02:11:30]  with the guy, and you're in the passenger seat, you're kind of like, wow, this thing  does stick to the road really well.  Like he's going around these curves just flying, and then you get in the car yourself, and  like I said, everything tells you, I'm not supposed to cut the wheel going this fast.  Yeah, and you do it and realize, oh yeah, this does kind of stick.  Then you've got to come out right next to the wall.  That stuff, though, I love doing.  That's fun for me, but I would never parachute. 
[02:12:00]  I would never bungee jump, but something like that, I love it.  Dude, that sounds awesome.  It was so cool.  I would love to have an opportunity to do something like that.  Oh, Pocono Raceway.  What were we talking about yesterday in Vegas?  Oh, I was just thinking that.  My ex did it.  We went to Vegas.  Oh, yeah, you were petrified again.  I wouldn't do it.  A little scared Jimmy.  I really am.  My race car driving is, you know, I don't wear condoms.  We all have our thing.  Come on, healthy.  Death-defying. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Whatever it is, it works.  We went to the stratosphere in Vegas where you fall.  I imagine you would do it.  I don't think Elijah would do it, yeah.  I don't think it's as scary as what he's already done.  It's a decelerator, yeah.  They use a decelerator.  You see this, right, Elijah?  Yeah.  Would you do that?  Would you jump probably about a 900-foot drop?  Would they just kind of lower you off the stratosphere?  Yeah.  You would do that?  Yeah, I would.  Yeah, so he's on a great heights. 
[02:13:00]  He's probably been in decelerators and rigging and stuff like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That doesn't really scare me.  That sounds...  Yeah, without horrifying me from that.  It wouldn't scare me if it was, like, a certain height.  Did you do that?  No, my girlfriend did.  Oh, okay.  Again, the castrating...  His girlfriend does all the manly stuff.  Yeah, she wanted...  No, she knew I wouldn't do it.  She knew not to ask.  She's lucky I paid for her to do it.  But, no, the elevator was the thing I did.  I was like, brave boy in the elevator.  The elevator!  The glass elevator at the Rio.  No, we saw Penn and Teller.  Total pussy. 
[02:13:30]  I am humiliating.  What is this ride?  At least you can own up to it.  I know.  I'm aware of that.  By the way, that's where you...  Get out of here.  Yeah, she did that, too.  What is that?  It's where they just hold you over the edge and they drop you.  What?  She said it wasn't that scary.  Oh, that's over the edge of...  Stratosphere.  That's scary, yeah.  Yeah, I know.  It's horrifying.  What a strange place Vegas is.  Yeah.  It really is just an odd place.  It is such an odd place.  I was just there for the Beatles' The Love Show, their fifth anniversary, and I actually 
[02:14:00]  got to DJ the event after, but I hadn't been to Vegas in a long time, and I hadn't really  spent time there as an adult.  Yeah.  It was a very odd...  It's such an odd city.  Weird mix.  It's like, there's kids there.  There's so much ingrained sadness.  Yeah.  It's such sadness.  You know, at like five in the morning, you're walking around, and there are old women smoking,  sitting there at the fucking slot machines.  Yeah, the slot machines just hoping for the big women.  Oh, my God.  You ever take the ride two blocks off the Strip? 
[02:14:30]  You want to see real sadness?  The old Strip?  Not even, man.  Like the actual town of Las Vegas?  Oh, yeah.  A mere two blocks away.  It is really sad.  I'm sure.  With the horrible motels, and...  Well, the whole city, it sort of survives on the fact that it's all about...  Losing your people.  Losing the house.  And it's a city built on hotels and gambling and attractions.  So people have to lose for them to sustain the city, so there's just, like you said, 
[02:15:00]  this underlying...  Dude, and they come in droves, and it feels like a lot of it's middle America and European  tourists, and ah, it's just a bummer.  They're just hoping to make that big one and forget about their problems.  And in the midst of it, there are these Cirque du Soleil shows.  It's so weird.  It really is built on misery.  It's a show that...  I mean, it's a place that can be enjoyed, for sure.  And I think, like, 36 to 48 hours, go to some great shows, have some great dinners,  and get the hell out. 
[02:15:30]  Do you gamble?  I don't gamble at all.  I don't go to work, so I have fun in Vegas because I don't gamble.  I'll blow 200 bucks in the week on video poker.  Gotta gamble a little.  I would...  Yeah, I didn't do it when I was there.  I would love to.  Like, I've never done blackjack at a table or poker at a table.  That would be awesome.  Yeah, it's hard to stop.  I'd want to be able to play with somebody that knows what they're doing.  It's fun.  This guy does.  That's fun.  You play?  Yeah.  He's, uh...  Yeah.  When I'm at casinos.  That's fun.  The thing is, I don't, like, make it a point to go to casinos just to gamble.  I go there, like, if Jimmy's playing at one of the, you know, casinos, I'll go, or, you 
[02:16:00]  know, a concert's on that I want to see, and then I'll go and I'll gamble and do that.  But, uh...  High roller.  To jump in a car and just go, ah, I want to gamble.  Or I'd be broke.  But when you're there, when you're there, you're all in.  He's in the high roller section.  If I say, if you're going, you go.  He spits on the floor, and they allow him to return.  Like, that doesn't tell you how much he's gambling.  He has a pillow that he gets to scream into.  Yeah. 
[02:16:30]  I was being much too loud when I...  I think he's being a little too polite how he's discussing this with you.  And my buddy Keith, he's a cop here in New York.  Usually, he's my security guy.  Nice.  And he grabbed a pillow, and he's just like, eh, here.  Because I would lean over sometimes and punch him.  I go, fuck it's a 21 dealer!  What is that crap?  You can't win with a 20 at this table?  20's not good enough at this table.  That's me.  I'm just going nuts.  It's a sickness.  It's a good time.  Every codependent around him is like, go ahead, please, just win. 
[02:17:00]  Please win.  So we don't have to pay for our own dinner.  Please.  We have to get a lot...  He has to wrap, so...  Yeah, we are.  We want to get the plugs out, too.  A busy guy.  You can follow him on Twitter.  It's at Wood Elijah, one word, E-L-I-J-A-H.  Wood Elijah is the word.  Oh, cool.  And Wilford, I really enjoy this.  I liked it, too, there, Elijah.  Thanks, man.  I think you got something here.  And there's some really, really fucking edgy stuff in it.  And I love where they went with a lot of the jokes.  There's nothing cutesy about it.  And for shitting in the boots, they won me immediately with a shit-in-the-boot moment. 
[02:17:30]  Very funny.  You can always score high points with shit-in-the-boot.  You can, though, because you don't see...  I've never seen the pilot, man.  I've never seen that in a show before.  It was fucking funny, and it was aggressive, and I liked it a lot.  I'm excited to see where the show goes.  You know, we did 13 episodes, and over the course of the season, it felt like the scripts  were getting better.  I love all the scripts, and they're very funny initially.  But it started to open up conceptually to play at a lot of other levels, and I feel 
[02:18:00]  like what it becomes at the end of the season, I'm really excited for people to see where  it goes.  I think that's what the show has to do.  You start off here, you let everybody get used to the characters, and then you start  to build on it, and like you said, expand.  That's great.  Yeah.  Well, good luck, man.  It's actually very funny.  Thank you.  Thanks for coming in, man.  Yeah, it's been a pleasure.  Fun.  Yeah, you guys are awesome.  Thanks, man.  Elijah, what?  You're listening to the worst, worst, worst, worst, the worst of Opie and Anthony's  Sirius XM.  That's a biggie, too.  Yeah, look at Tony Bennett, all class, all class.  Mr. Bennett, look at the guy, just dressed to the nines. 
[02:18:30]  Hi, Tony.  What a gentleman.  Hey, thanks.  Good morning, Mr. Bennett.  How are you?  See you.  Welcome to the show.  Pleasure.  Tony.  Tony looks great.  Yeah.  You look great.  Thanks so much.  Like a million bucks.  Do you know Stephen Wright?  Great comedian.  Hey, Stephen.  How are you?  Nice to meet you.  Pleasure to meet you.  Yeah, that's Anthony and Opie.  Anthony, Opie.  Hey, Tony.  Young Sam.  Pleasure to meet you, sir.  Jimmy Norton, comedian extraordinaire.  Nice to meet you, man.  Also.  Yeah, this is nice.  Kind of small.  We would have liked a bigger studio at some point in our careers, thinking we've been 
[02:19:00]  doing this for now almost, you know, 18 years together.  I like that it's intimate.  You like the intimacy of it all?  I do.  I like, years ago I started out, all entertainment was intimate, you know.  Sure.  Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis and Frank Sinatra, all the great artists that when they first  started out, we only worked in nightclubs that had only 750 seats.  It was Liberace who said, I'd like to play Madison Square Garden. 
[02:19:30]  And they said, are you crazy?  And he tried it, and it worked.  And every business executive ever since said, wow, what a business.  Let's go into big stadiums.  Right.  And the whole music world changed, and entertainment changed, and the big stadiums.  Wow.  Did you guys know about Liberace back then?  Like, would you guys talk among yourselves and go, you know, I think.  No, yes.  Start it off.  You guys knew.  Knew what?  You know.  Okay. 
[02:20:00]  What?  He still doesn't know.  Did you know he was gay back then or no?  What?  You're mumbling.  What are you saying?  Did you know Liberace was gay back in those days?  Everybody knew he was gay.  Oh, they did know, because the public people.  But he was a very, actually, he was a great piano player, you know.  A lot of people didn't realize that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He was, like, highly competent.  But people didn't know in the public.  A lot of people had no idea.  They just thought he was flamboyant.  I guess it was something people in show business all knew from being around him.  I don't think it was show business.  I think he was ahead of time, you know.  Now it's, you know, accepted. 
[02:20:30]  Right.  Someone is that way.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  In those days, it was like, wow, that's different.  Your first hit was 1951.  Like, it's amazing to me, that longevity.  Like, that was, like, 10 years before the Beatles, 12 years before the Beatles.  Like, you've been famous for a long...  Since the 50s.  Wow.  How much has Vegas changed?  Completely.  Yeah.  It was much...  It was great originally.  The Underworld built it with the Mormons. 
[02:21:00]  And they owned...  The Mormons owned the land.  And the Underworld came in.  And it was by the Underworld, I mean Jewish and Italian...  Businessmen.  You know.  And they invented this tremendous idea.  And it worked.  Right.  Did you like the way the Underworld, let's just say, the way they took care of talent compared to...  Absolutely.  Much better than the big corporations.  They are, right?  Yeah, the big corporations are big, but they're uncreative. 
[02:21:30]  Everything has to pay for itself.  Like, even the dining rooms.  The rooms have to be filled up and all that.  Whereas, the Underworld was just pretty relaxed about, hey, we're making a lot of money.  You know, so let's just let everybody have a good time.  Yeah.  So do you miss those days?  The telephones were free.  All lunches were free.  It was a very relaxed kind of thing out there. 
[02:22:00]  I bet he got a lot more personal, like, service as far as...  I guess now it's got to go through channels and management and board of directors and stuff where it...  Probably in the old days it was, you know, one guy saying, yeah, sure.  Make sure Tony's got that.  Well, you know, you're absolutely right.  I mean, I remember very clearly I was playing in a big nightclub there and I wasn't doing business.  It was before my big record of San Francisco. 
[02:22:30]  And I felt so bad that I wasn't doing business.  And I went to the big boys that own the nightclub and I said, I feel very bad.  You don't have to pay me this week.  They said, get out of here.  They said, don't worry about it.  We come in, we're listening to you anyway.  You know, there's just a few people.  Then all of a sudden my record hit of San Francisco and it got packed and everything like that.  They were very nice about, you know, come on, just go and entertain.  Don't worry about it.  Now, we may someday ask you for a favor. 
[02:23:00]  This day may never come.  Huh?  What's up?  Jimmy goes, huh?  The mutin understand it.  That Godfather reference.  The music business back then, too.  It's like, has that changed for the better or the worse?  Because it seems like artists are kind of harder to screw over now than they were back then.  Like, I think record companies took advantage of a lot of artists.  Isn't it harder to do now, do you think? 
[02:23:30]  Like, is it better for the artists now or no?  Well, it's better financially.  You're playing big stadiums and everything.  But it's not as creative.  The original music of the 50s and before the 50s was a tremendous era.  When you get to the 20s, 30s, and 40s, way before my time, but you had Irving Berlin, who was Mr. America.  You had George Gershwin. 
[02:24:00]  You had Cole Porter, who was better than anybody.  You had, they came out of silent films.  And when talkies came in, you had Fred Astaire introducing all these great songs written by those great men.  And Broadway.  And there was a higher level of great popular music that will never go away.  The corporation will say, well, that's old music.  This is new.  We're going to sell you something new.  But it's not as good as those songs like Night and Day or They Can't Take That Away From Me or Let's Change Partners in Dance. 
[02:24:30]  Those songs will last forever.  They're part of, we've actually fed that music to everybody.  I perform all over the world in Asia, in Japan, in China, Australia, in Europe.  And everyone in the world loves the music from the United States.  They love those songs.  So that's what we've contributed to the world. 
[02:25:00]  No other country's ever done that.  I mean, what's the number one song in Germany?  What's the number one song in Norway?  Yeah.  Right?  But in our country, we just gave the greatest popular music to the world.  And people love us for that.  Now, are you also, because I get teased a lot, but I'm a legitimate Lady Gaga fan.  Like, I like her.  And I don't like her to be ironic.  I really think she's good.  And then people have said that you like her as well. 
[02:25:30]  I think she's fantastic.  Oh, good.  I've met a lot of performers in my life.  And there's something about her that's very, very intellectual and very spontaneous and very talented.  She sings beautiful.  She plays great piano.  She knows how to dance.  But more than that, she reinvents herself almost on a nightly basis.  I've never seen that.  But usually, if someone is good, you say, boy, she's good, or he's good, and they're good, and that's who they are. 
[02:26:00]  She keeps changing herself all the time, and she's very creative.  And you did this CD coming out now.  It's called Duets 2.  And we played the single before, a great thing you did with Amy Winehouse.  Body and Soul.  She has such a great old school.  She had a great old school sound.  It's not old.  It's great.  See, when you say old, I'm telling you that that music is not old. 
[02:26:30]  It's great, and it's always going to be good.  In other words, if you hear Nat King Cole today, or Frank Sinatra, they've been gone for 22 years now.  Yeah, Nat King Cole.  Now, 50 years from now, you'll listen to that record.  It's not going to sound old, because they did it right.  I should say, yeah, maybe old school is the wrong way to say it.  It is a wrong way to say it.  It's more, I should say, a great classic or vintage sound.  You don't hear that in a lot of modern performers, that type of Billie Holiday type of sound. 
[02:27:00]  She has an old soul.  Yeah, maybe that's what it is.  Like an old soul, possibly, right?  Yeah, I mean that in a complimentary way.  It's much more intellectual music.  Everybody knew how to read music in those days.  You know, there was an army of musicians that all lost their jobs and had to become, go into mathematical jobs of some kind, you know, insurance salesman or something like that, when it changed.  It was a major change in music, and for the worst, actually, because the music was at a very high level. 
[02:27:30]  You know, the great bands of Duke Ellington and Count Basie and Stan Kenton and Woody Herman, they had tremendous musicians that all really knew how to read music like the back of their hand, you know, and they just understood it.  And now it's, I asked Jimmy Durante many years ago, about 47 years ago, I said, what do you think of rock and roll?  He said, well, they play three chords and two of them are wrong. 
[02:28:00]  Are you, did you reach out to all these artists and say that you wanted to play with them?  And the response has got to be, it's got to make you feel good that everybody in the business wants to work with you.  Everybody wants to.  It's a wonderful honor.  My son was responsible for creating this album, and he reached out to all of them, and they said, yes, let's do it. 
[02:28:30]  We did the first album, the duets album, and it sold millions of records.  And as a result, Sony Columbia just said, come on, you have to do another album like this.  And the second album is very promising.  It's not even out yet, and it's already number one on Amazon, and it's number one in Spain, and the Netherlands, and all over Europe.  And it's just on pre-orders.  That's without people even hearing the records. 
[02:29:00]  So there's something very promising about it.  I'm thrilled.  You've been performing, obviously, for many years.  You still have such a passion for these songs, singing them.  Are there ever nights where you're like, oh, you know, I'm going to do San Francisco again?  No, no.  Or do you have that strong a passion for these songs?  Well, I'm surrounded by just four great musicians, great jazz artists.  And every time we perform, they're so creative that they change it every night. 
[02:29:30]  It's never the same show.  It might be the same repertoire, but believe me, every night it feels like a different, like we're just starting out for the first time.  And they're very creative jazz artists that improvise every show no matter where we're at.  And what do you do to care for your voice?  Because you've been blessed over the years that you still have your set of pipes.  And, you know, other artists over the years have lost the ability to hit some of the notes.  And what do you attribute that to?  Well, good training. 
[02:30:00]  You know, after the Second World War, I came out and joined the American Theater Wing.  And because it was the Good War, as Studs Terkel in Chicago called it, we were just given the best teachers in New York City.  And the American Theater Wing was so good, it became the Active Studio.  And all those great teachers really taught us well about how to preserve your voice and the repetition of taking care of it.  And it works. 
[02:30:30]  Because it's obviously worked because, yeah, you're one of the few artists that just sound amazing so many years later.  Oh, yeah, you can't even tell.  I know.  Thank you very much.  How do you stay young, Tony?  Well, I don't know about staying young.  I just accept my age.  I don't regret it.  Yeah, but you're still performing on it.  I always say life is a gift, you know, and just enjoy every moment.  We're all going through it.  You work out.  No one's going to beat it.  No matter how you feel now, once you get old, it's not like the end of the world. 
[02:31:00]  You're still alive.  But there's things you're doing.  You're working out and eating right and all that.  Oh, yeah.  I play tennis three times a week.  I exercise and eat good foods.  And I have a wonderful wife who takes care of me.  Everything's great.  I hate going to the gym.  Like, I mean, I know this looks like it was actually built in a gym.  I could see that.  But it's, it's, it's, even Tony knows I'm in awful shape. 
[02:31:30]  Tony's in better shape than you, Johnny.  He totally is.  It's really hard to motivate yourself to go out and be, it's like, you've reached such  a level of success.  To motivate yourself to stay healthy and to keep producing, I think, is even more impressive  because you're already there.  Thank you.  Like, you can't get any more famous than you are, and you still continue to put out music.  Produce.  Well, you're only as good as your next show.  Yeah.  Not the last one.  It's the next one.  Are you still doing a lot of live shows every year?  Do you still love going out and doing gigs? 
[02:32:00]  That's what I do.  Yeah, you do.  You stay on the road.  I like it, too.  But I don't like working big stadiums.  I like working nice, intimate, like, my idea of a great place is Carnegie Hall.  You know, you have beautiful seats.  Yeah, a nice little small place like Carnegie.  It's civilized for the people.  It's a tiny little place, right?  It's small, but it's 2,700 seats.  Right, right.  No, I hate to be traveled by 2,700.  It just goes to show how huge Tony Bennett is, when, like, people would die to play Carnegie  Hall.  It's like, yeah, a little room.  You know, Carnegie Hall.  That's bad. 
[02:32:30]  Hey, we, unfortunately, we've got to wrap up with Mr. Bennett, but we do want to promote  duets, too.  You got everyone.  That's very nice.  Thank you.  Katie Lang, Michael Buble, Carrie Underwood, Willie Nelson, John Mayer, Nora Jones, of  course, Amy Winehouse.  Lady Gaga is on the album?  Absolutely.  Yeah, because we don't have her track here, unfortunately.  Sheryl Crow, Faith Hill, the list goes on and on.  Mariah Carey.  It's a tremendous list of people.  And the Amy Winehouse, I think the proceeds from that are going to, like, the Amy Winehouse  Foundation, which is really nice.  That's exactly right. 
[02:33:00]  And she was getting her shit together when you guys got together, right?  She looked pretty healthy, everyone is saying.  She was healthy the day that we recorded, yes.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  It's just a shame.  Nice downer note there, Opa.  Thanks.  I mean, yeah, I'm sorry.  You know, it's, uh, Dave.  I have one more question, and it's not even that, did you really perform at the opening  of the Triborough Bridge?  Yep.  It is true.  With Mayor LaGuardia.  Wow.  I was a little baby.  I was a little, you know, five or six or seven years old.  We marched along doing singing along together. 
[02:33:30]  Everybody in Queens, it was the first time that we walked over the Triborough Bridge into  Manhattan.  Oh, wow, man.  Wow.  And you were there, and now, you know, how much does it cost?  I was just going to say, when you opened that bridge, did you ever think it would cost  $300 to drive across it?  No, they said it was going to be free.  Yeah, well, see what happened?  They do.  They certainly did.  Well, you're a legend and was very happy.  In my own mind. 
[02:34:00]  Other people, too, I think.  Tony, thanks so much for coming in, man.  Okay, thank you very much.  You've been fantastic.  Thank you so much.  Have a good day.  Just a minute, ladies and gentlemen.  I think something has happened.  This is the worst of Opie and Anthony's serious XM.  Mr. Shatner has just arrived.  Oh, there he is.  The great William Shatner has just arrived.  Conglomeration.  How are you, Bill?  Hi, how are you?  The Opie and Anthony channel.  It's been a while, sir.  It's been Opie and Anthony channel.  Wow.  No one's supposed to know about that.  That's okay. 
[02:34:30]  But that's okay if you're announcing it.  Yeah, of course it is.  The Opie and Anthony channel.  It hasn't happened.  It hasn't happened yet.  It's barely a show.  Here it is at Tampa.  It's true, right?  It's barely a show.  It's, yeah.  Did he just make the official announcement?  I guess, yeah.  I was doing some recordings back there.  Before I came in the building.  They wouldn't let me in the building, first of all.  And then they finally let me in the building.  The first thing I do is,  would you say the Opie and Anthony channel, please? 
[02:35:00]  Nice.  Why wouldn't they let you in the building?  You're William Shatner.  I know.  God's sake.  Maybe that's why.  I know.  I left my bag that I carry around in this car that's taking me around.  I didn't want to schlep it around.  Yeah.  So I left my identification.  Oh, my God.  So the person from the publishing company is holding up my book as identification.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the woman says, I read it.  I don't want them to let me in the building.  I would have just given that retinal scan, much like you did in the Wrath of Khan, when you 
[02:35:30]  just looked into it.  My eyes were a little bloodshot from...  Yeah, in order to get the information for the Genesis device.  Yes.  That was very complicated.  Well, I like to think I could sit and talk with Bill about anything, a little bit of everything.  And Star Trek does come up every two seconds with me.  I've never seen an episode of Star Trek. 
[02:36:00]  Not one.  What are you, crazy?  I just haven't.  I'm sorry.  What's wrong with you?  I would like to.  There's something wrong with him.  It starts with the language.  That's right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, what's that accent?  Anybody with that kind of accent will watch.  We only just got TV in Australia, let alone Star Trek.  Really?  I don't know.  What are they got?  Skippy the Bush Kangaroo?  Very popular show.  I remember that one.  Jesus, how do you remember that?  I don't know.  Was that a show?  Yeah, that was Skippy the Bush Kangaroo.  It was basically like Lassie, but it was kangaroo based. 
[02:36:30]  You mean that?  Yeah.  And so, like, you'd have this kid called Sonny, he'd fall down a well, and Skippy would come  up and go...  And they'd go, what's that, Skippy?  Sonny's falling down the well.  Now, the thing is, they always used to get Skippy to point the direction, and they could  never get their kangaroo to do that, so they used to just fucking go into the bush,  kill another kangaroo, cut its arm off, and there'd be some cameraman poking this dead  limb.  Suddenly the laughter ebbed out of the way.  Yeah, what happened?  What happened?  How do you know that's true? 
[02:37:00]  Not later.  That's hilarious.  That was fun.  That's true.  Which is a great segue into your book, by the way, Anger.  Yes.  Well, you're a funny dude.  It's called Shatner Rules, and I didn't read the whole thing, because I was reading another  biography, but I've read the first couple of chapters.  Wait, one eye on one book, and the other eye on the other book?  I'm not a good multicast.  That's how he does it.  We've had a lot of authors in lately, but...  I love the writing in this.  Thank you.  The first one's about the Comedy Central roast, where you got roasted, and it was funny,  because you put some comebacks that you should have said there in this, and you don't seem 
[02:37:30]  to take yourself seriously at all.  Which is great.  Well, there's not much to take seriously about.  You've got to handle your material, and there's not much to handle here.  No, I'm joking.  The laughter ebbed out of the thing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wait a minute.  It's cutting up the arm of a kangaroo.  I'm just glad it's not just me, to be honest with you.  Thanks for making the Skippy story look good.  You and I should unite on publicizing this book. 
[02:38:00]  So the book does carry some of those...  I mean, somebody yesterday said, I'm getting a seat on the subway because I read the book  in the subway.  I start cackling out loud, and people move aside.  Oh, they kind of move.  Yeah, because they think they're crazy, and then they sit down on the subway.  When I think of you, to me, the best definition of you is the SNL sketch you did, where you  kind of goofed on, you know, like, you know, it's a show, get over it.  Like, that's how I kind of view your personality, and I read everything kind of hearing it in  that voice. 
[02:38:30]  In that kind of voice, yeah.  And chapter two is, to be a Shatner, you must know Shatner, and I kind of finished  that, where you just list a bunch of facts about yourself, which are interesting and  fucking hilarious.  Like, I don't know why I liked the one about your first movie, which you said, what was  it called?  I can't find...  My first film in a 1951 Canadian film, titled The Butler's Night Off.  I've never seen it.  I don't know why that interested me so much.  You've never seen the first movie you did.  There's so much I haven't seen of my...  You know, I avoid watching it.  As you should. 
[02:39:00]  The book is funny, and the book attempts to say, and there's all...  There's a group of guys, I'm telling your listening audience here, there's two, four,  six, eight...  There's eight, nine guys in the room here, and...  One woman showed of a ripe.  Oh, Jesus.  Of a minion.  And everybody's got a voice.  And my book, I don't know how I'm going to relate this, is the concept behind the book 
[02:39:30]  is to say yes to opportunities.  So you guys have all said yes, you're going to be here, we're having an adventure together  just by the very fact that you're here.  My book says, say yes to opportunity, yes to life, and that's the basis of the book, and  everything is told, hopefully with humor, but with that idea in mind.  That's a pretty good philosophy to have.  Very unlike the character in the Twilight Zone, putting the penny in the machine, and 
[02:40:00]  his life was pretty much being dictated by every little slip that came out.  He goes, should we leave?  Should we leave now?  Should we check if the car is repaired?  Very different...  What a great science fiction concept, or horror concept.  It's fantastic.  It's a great...  The writing, the guy, the writer, who said, I was doing this machine, wouldn't it be marvelous  if somebody's life was dictated, I'll write that script.  Yes, and you know what else was great about that?  There wasn't any weird, scary thing in there, the whole thing, it wasn't supernatural, it 
[02:40:30]  was just somebody's paranoia, and them getting caught up in something.  Right, but it made a Twilight Zone.  It was a very...  And struck a sort of universal note.  Yeah.  It's a round moment.  Unlike, of course, there's a man on the wing.  You know.  I always liked that one, too.  And that one, too.  Yeah.  I mean, it's truly that stemmed around, if we were meant to fly, we'd have wings.  Right! 
[02:41:00]  Who did that first?  You or Lithgow, who did that first?  Who'd what?  Oh, Shatner.  Oh, no, Shatner did.  I'm kidding.  Stop it.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, Jimmy.  You know what?  I don't even care if you're kidding.  It's hard to tell.  You don't insult Bill Shatner like that.  No, no.  His little smiley face looking up at you.  You don't know whether he's kidding or not.  I know.  He's real back.  Can I say another great thing that I like, and I want to ask you about this, another  funny fact number 12.  I once got into a fist fight on stage during the Broadway run of The World of Susie Wong  with Australian actor Ron Randell.  For 50 years, he's ignored my challenges for a rematch. 
[02:41:30]  Coward!  Editor's note, Mr. Randell died in 2005.  It's fucking funny, man.  When he heard me issue that challenge, he died.  It's great, man.  That is awesome.  Did you really?  But what spurred the fist fight?  I've been wanting to ask you that for a week.  He used to clap me on the shoulder.  Somewhere after opening night, when the show's supposed to be frozen, and he had a laugh  on some line, and he'd clap me on the shoulder like, hey, hail fellow, well met. 
[02:42:00]  If the laugh was good and loud, he would just be a tap.  But if he missed the laugh, either in rage or frustration or thinking it was my fault,  he'd hit me hard.  So after a while, I'd say, Ron, you know, that scene's becoming all about my absorbing  your punch.  And he was an Olympic swimmer.  Had been.  All the strains are.  Yeah, apparently so.  He never let up.  And I kept asking people, will you ask him to not hit me so hard?  Stage manager, Josh Logan, the producer, everybody. 
[02:42:30]  And finally, one day, after months of this, I said, if you hit me again, I'm going to  have to hit you back.  So he took that as a challenge.  So he hit me on stage.  Wow.  So I hit him back on stage.  In the middle of the show.  In the middle of the show.  Oh, what a great show.  And then when the first act curtain came down, he came charging over at me, swung.  I ducked and he hit a prop guy in the face.  Now, did the crowd think that was part of the show?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, we just kept going.  And what I didn't write about, because what happened after that was finally the curtain 
[02:43:00]  came down and everybody left the theater, including me.  And the next day, the next evening, we all went to our dressing rooms, 7.30, 8 o'clock.  And those dressing room doors are kept open by a wedge because it's a fire door.  And so to keep them open, they're wedged.  I'm in my dressing room and in he comes.  And he's looking for a fight in the dressing room, in a 12 by 12 dressing room.  That's like being locked in a cage with a mountain lion. 
[02:43:30]  The stage manager got between us.  Somebody kicked the wedge out.  The door shut and there were three guys in a small room.  Oh, shit.  And I had a picture, a mental image of his jugular and I was going to go bite him on the jugular.  That's where I was going.  Maniacal.  They finally kept us apart.  Now, did you ever make up with him?  Oh, yeah.  You know how much history would have changed if you, like, say you would have bitten his neck  and then they just threw you out acting.  Just like, you know, you can't hire this guy.  He fucking bites the neck of the other actors.  He bites people on the neck, yeah.  Like how different life would be. 
[02:44:00]  Well, I've seen that.  Let's get him to bite somebody on the neck.  Oh, yeah, that's true.  I've seen Bill deliver a karate chop, though.  That probably would have taken him right out.  One of those quick, boom, boom.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Quick pork chop, too.  Whatever kind of chops you need.  Do you really suffer from tinnitus?  I do.  Which, by the way, funny line, for many years I've suffered from tinnitus.  That's where I pulled it out of.  Now it only flares up when I don't want to listen to all those questions about Star Trek. 
[02:44:30]  You know what tinnitus is?  It's when you had that ringing in your ears, right?  From where'd you get it from?  Well, I got it from an explosion, but sound engineers have it.  Rock musicians have it.  Radio people.  Radio people have it.  You got it from woke force.  Armed forces have it a lot.  What explosion?  Explosion on set, actually.  The doors were shut.  They should have been cracked because of the air charging.  And they didn't.  And ever since then, it's gotten worse over the years.  And when you, it's funny, for your roast, you asked Leonard Nimoy to come, and he said no. 
[02:45:00]  He just, he couldn't handle it, right?  He knew more than I did.  Oh.  I hadn't really seen it.  Oh, no.  Did you enjoy the roast?  You know, that's like, uh, that's like, uh, Frank Sinatra's roasts and, uh, Dean Martin.  Right.  Hey, hey, look at the funny, and, uh, it wasn't that at all.  It was very insulting.  It was really mean.  Did you see the Chalichine one?  I did, yeah.  I thought you were very good on the Chalichine.  Thank you. 
[02:45:30]  We had a couple of friends that, uh, were part of the roast.  What?  Patrice O'Neill and Amy Schumer are friends of ours.  Well, uh, first of all, it's very funny.  Yes.  But it's like an intervention.  Yeah.  And it occurred to me, why not have an intervention and shaming people?  Look what you've done to your family.  Look what you've done to your friends.  Look what you've done to your son.  You lost your job.  You lost all the money.  And then the person is like cowering and feeling so badly, they think I got to go get a drink.  Right?  I mean, that's what an intervention is.  Why not do it with humor?  Right.  You're a funny guy.  Look what you've done.  And, and, and, and mock them with humor. 
[02:46:00]  So it's less an attack and more an observation.  Right, right, right.  So you seem to have a pretty thick skin about stuff like that.  Like, you're not easily, uh...  I am.  Don't say anything mean.  I don't know if I could handle having one about myself.  I think there's people...  No, no, it's terrible.  It's terribly thick.  But wait a minute.  It doesn't like you're locked in a room with eight guys here with a microphone and you think  nobody's listening anyway.  Yeah.  Mike, uh, the, the, the, this channel, uh, you know there's a thousand people in the audience. 
[02:46:30]  Uh, and there's all these people on the dais laughing.  Ha, ha, he's getting it.  Yeah.  It's turned to be whack.  You know?  And then, uh, it's awful.  It looks very uncomfortable at times and you have to kind of sit there and laugh.  Uh, but yeah, you gotta...  You mean you, the audience, or the person there?  I would think the person there would have to...  The person there is gritting their teeth.  Yeah, you gotta make believe it doesn't bother you.  Oh, yeah.  It doesn't really matter.  Ha, ha, ha.  You gotta be good at acting.  It can only be done in America.  The, the British couldn't do it. 
[02:47:00]  I don't think.  There would be a fight?  No, no.  In the end, they'd just be polite to each other.  They would just call in with, nah, I'm not gonna say that.  I quite like you.  Ha, ha, ha.  But the, but the, but the, but the British get skewered in their papers.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, the tabloid.  The tabloid papers.  Yeah, yeah.  As bad as ours are, the English are just way worse than they were.  Well, their mainstream papers are like our tabloid papers.  It really is kind of, I like the nudity in it, though.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  The wonderful thing, I just have tits on page three.  Yeah, for no reason.  Like it's, like it's part of their rights.  Like they've tried to take him away, and the English are just like, what, and sometimes 
[02:47:30]  in some of the papers in the sun, they'll have like Jenny with her tits out, and then  a speech bubble, saying what Jenny thinks about the war in Iraq.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  That's very funny, but, and I don't want to get, push this book too much, except to say  that it's a great read, and I urge your listeners to, it debuted, or it dropped, yes,  Tuesday, and next Tuesday, but you can get it now, the, my record is, which we played 
[02:48:00]  Iron Man from, which you're getting a lot of, hey, listen, I came up on the elevator  to the, uh, uh, uh, Opie and Anthony channel.  Yes.  And, uh, and, uh, some young man with his hair combed up with a lot of brass and, and  leather.  Jose.  Was it Jose?  Yes.  The spokesman for, uh, heavy metal?  Yeah, yeah.  I heard your record, it's great, heavy metal, we need to, metal, I said, well, if I get on  the air, I'll talk about the, the, the energy that was necessary to, to do this, uh, this 
[02:48:30]  song with Zach Wilde.  Yeah.  20 of the greatest musicians alive today are on, uh, uh, Seeking Major Tom.  Uh, uh, but for the moment, Zach Wilde is, have you ever had him up here?  Yes.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  All right, so you know what an extraordinary individual he is.  Yeah.  And what, and what a fabulous musician.  Amazing.  I mean, apparently he went, I didn't know this, he went from being, uh, 130 pounds, uh, skinny  guy playing for Ozzy, right? 
[02:49:00]  Yeah.  And then he went from that to this muscled up dude with tattoos and a long ponytail, uh, where  that transformation took place, I don't know.  Right.  But I was in a studio and watching him lay down his tracks for Iron Man, which in this  arc of what happened to Major Tom, when after the Bowie song, what, what did happen to Major  Tom when he stepped out of the capsule?  I speculate in all these songs, walking on the moon.  Oh, okay.  You got it?  So then he begins to die and he begins to hallucinate and we go into his background with Bohemian 
[02:49:30]  Rhapsody.  We get to the twilight zone.  We get, and finally he goes to heaven.  And he imagines heaven with the Sinatra song querying God.  How could you let this happen?  And goes to hell in Iron Man.  So I tell Zach Wilde, this is the concert.  He says, I want to be part of it.  And I go up to a studio and I've laid down my track.  I'm doing Iron Man, Iron Man, Iron Man.  I go up to the studio and he is a mad man with this extraordinary fingering of his guitar 
[02:50:00]  and the voice and the, and the energy, the pure energy, the artistry of Zach Wilde.  Well, I fell over.  I had no idea.  I had to go back to the studio days later and lay down another track to match the energy.  He did the vocals, right?  That was Zach singing?  I'm singing with me.  Right, you are.  He's doing the backups.  One of us was doing the backup to the other at various times.  It was, but my eyes and my vocal cords were opened at the concept of heavy metal. 
[02:50:30]  I had no idea.  Yeah.  Well, Zach's very good.  Yeah.  And, and so you listen to his guitar tracks and.  And his vocals.  And you had laid the vocals down already.  Yeah.  So you were kind of like, boy, I gotta.  That's exactly right.  I gotta step this up.  This is, I've done nothing.  I'm the weak sister here.  I'm folded in.  Exactly.  I had no idea.  I, you know, heavy metal is foreign to me. 
[02:51:00]  I guess you have to comb your hair up and wear black leather.  And I got a headbanger award, an honorary headbanger award from Revolver magazine for  this, for this number.  And, and I, and the one question I kept getting, what the hell are you doing here?  But he even called it a number.  That's old school.  That's what Ozzy introduced.  We're going to do a number now.  That's, that's fucking, that's old school.  Well, what, what else do you, that song or this one, but Ozzy calls it a number.  That's the way you should address it as a number. 
[02:51:30]  And so you have to get a little more metal based than you think.  And Mr. Shatner is 80, right?  The what?  How old are you now, sir?  Uh, 37.  37.  37, 38.  Oh, that's, that's, that's, that's where I, I think I left off.  I stopped thinking about, I don't mind.  I stopped about 37.  It's just amazing.  Yeah.  First of all, you don't look your age whatsoever.  Or act it.  You're an amazingly healthy energy.  You're able to keep up with Zach Wilder.  Are you kidding me?  That's, that's pretty crazy.  And it's all right.  Well, that's, I think, uh, DNA. 
[02:52:00]  You don't think it's good living?  Well, it's that too.  I haven't abused myself too much.  Yeah.  Now, do you drink or do you, do you eat unhealthy or you're fairly regimented?  I probably, uh, I, I don't know you and your habits, but, uh.  Terrible.  Terrible.  Well, then I'm regimented.  You used to be a smoker, right?  What?  You were a smoker.  A long time ago.  I gave it up a long time ago.  All right, because I remember you doing, when you did the cover of Rocket Man, and you  had that cigarette, and you just, you looked cool as hell earlier. 
[02:52:30]  We played that drastic.  It was cool as fuck.  I was trying to do, I was trying to do some after I did.  That's the reason why I took up smoking.  I was glad I was able to help you.  Between all those sawbones of the kangaroo.  You're cutting off kangaroo arms.  I needed another hobby.  They cut off their tails.  You know, they live.  You cut off their tails, they eat them, and they grow a new tail.  Kangaroos?  I don't know that.  I know certain reptiles.  I don't know. 
[02:53:00]  Maybe you're thinking of the Gorn.  I think the Gorn is a...  I'm throwing that out there as a possibility.  He knows more about Star Trek than Mr. Shatner.  Of course I do.  Is that a Star Trek reference?  Yes, Shatner knows that.  He doesn't know this stuff.  I just never stop.  I don't think he knows this stuff.  I never stop with the Star Trek references.  Well, let me tell you about another Star Trek thing that I've done.  Oh, please.  Now, wait a minute.  You're going to love this.  All right.  I directed a documentary I called The Captains.  Okay?  Now, it was released on Epyx television, and it's going into the theaters in Canada, and 
[02:53:30]  it's coming out as a DVD here, October 20th, in a couple of weeks.  Ooh.  DVD of The Captains.  It's really sensational.  It made its premiere on the aircraft carrier, the Intrepid, one summer's evening, this past  summer, while the sun was setting, and the skyline of New York was lighting up, a huge 
[02:54:00]  screen on the landing deck, and a thousand people watching this film.  It's all about the actors.  It's all about the actors, the human beings who played the captains in Star Trek.  But it's about their character.  It's about their soul.  It's about what we have in common, what we have as differences.  Something marvelous happened in this documentary.  It has an arc and a meaning, and it's funny, and it's soulful.  And there's even an interview with, there you are, 80 years old. 
[02:54:30]  George DeKai.  With George DeKai, Leonard Nimoy.  No, no, our musician, the musician.  A musician.  Oh, shit.  Zach Wild.  In which we, name a company a second.  He's a good buddy, and now I can't think of his name.  In which we sing the interview.  Oh, Jesus.  It's so much fun.  It's a DVD called The Captains, and it's coming out October. 
[02:55:00]  You keep so goddamn busy.  He's written, how many books?  Yeah, how many books?  30 books.  You're going to love this.  30.  Star Trek.  You're going to love this.  After that documentary and the success of the documentary, they said, what else do you  want to do?  I said, well, I'd like to examine why people go to conventions.  Why in this particular case, people go to the Star Trek conventions.  Yeah.  So I went to Vegas, where they were having the largest Star Trek convention of its kind 
[02:55:30]  ever.  20,000 people.  And I shot a documentary on why people go to conventions.  I had written a book some years earlier called Get a Life, which I discovered through interview  that they were going there to see themselves, to see each other.  To partake of each other.  That's what I discovered in the book.  What I discovered in the documentary, which I'm calling Fanatics, and it'll be released  in a few months, is that they're there out of passion for each other, passion for the 
[02:56:00]  subject, but another deeper meaning.  Joseph Campbell wrote a book called A Hero with a Thousand Faces.  And it's obvious that it's a fact that every culture has its mythology, starting from way  back, even before the Greeks.  Mythology.  Star Trek is this culture's mythology.  The actors who play the captains are their heroes.  They partake in the ritual of the mythology by going to the convention, by wearing the 
[02:56:30]  costumes, by getting the autographs, by getting the doodads, by what you are doing in your  passion for Star Trek.  Just remembering lines and scenes.  What you are doing is participating in the ritual of the mythology.  And it's an honorable thing.  Yes.  Especially while languishing in alcoholism.  It's also 20,000 people trying to lose their virginity. 
[02:57:00]  In one fell swoop.  Lying on the floor.  Riving.  Should we plug everything?  Yeah.  Well, I want to play another song off his CD, too.  Which song are you going to play?  I was going to ask you.  I haven't heard Twilight Zone.  When I recorded, I thought, hmm, this could be pretty good.  But I haven't heard anybody play it.  Why don't you play Twilight Zone?  And you know what?  You've got Warren Haynes.  I love the Warren Haynes.  I mean, just read that list of musicians that are on there.  Warren Haynes knows how to play, man. 
[02:57:30]  Cheryl Crow sings Mrs. Major Tom.  Lyle Lovett.  Brad Paisley.  And then you go on with Peter Frampton, John Wilton, Wayne Kramer.  Or, I mean, Michael Schenker.  Michael Schenker.  Ernie Watts.  I mean, the list goes on and on.  And on and on and on.  And also, Zach.  And I love the Iron Man version.  I like the fact that you sang it.  I thought it was cool.  Thank you so much.  On YouTube, you can see clips of him going, I am Iron Man, trying to get the opening.  You know what that clip is?  That clip is me in the first, when I laid that track down first. 
[02:58:00]  And I'm trying to find the music, and I can't find it.  I couldn't find it because I wasn't doing it right.  Only when Zach showed me the way was I able to do it.  Yeah, it's amazing.  And Zach sounds like Ozzy.  Yeah, he sounds great.  For a minute there, I thought it was Ozzy himself.  Very cool, William Schenker.  Thank you so much for coming in.  We always love having you on, man.  Absolutely.  This is the worst of the O.P. Anthony Show. 
[02:58:30]  Sirius XM.  Yeah, we're busy now.  We got Tom Sizemore in studio.  Yes.  Welcome, Tom.  Hi, how are you?  I'm writing a poem right now.  Excuse me.  Are you writing a poem?  No.  It's a poem.  You don't seem like the write a poem kind of guy.  I am, though.  Yeah?  Believe it or not, yeah.  Yeah?  Touch with your feelings and stuff.  I feel like New York City is really hot.  I'm glad I moved.  That's a pretty good poem, Tom.  That's more of a haiku.  No, I wish I hadn't moved.  Last night I said to my manager,  Charles Lego,  I can't think enough of everything,  but I said,  God, I never should have moved out of here. 
[02:59:00]  And then this morning we were walking over here  and we got the wrong directions  and we ended up at Central Park  and it was really hot.  Oh, yeah.  And I went,  oh, my God,  I wish I never went.  Am I here?  It's just New York has that thing.  It does to you.  Yeah, you lived here initially?  Oh, yeah.  I lived here for a long time.  Yeah.  I lived here from 84 through 91.  I lived here,  then I had an apartment here through 98.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, wow.  You moved out to L.A. in necessity?  Well, you've got to come back.  Well, that's where it was.  Well, you've kind of got to go there  unless you,  I don't know,  you don't have to,  but I've got to take in the bar 
[02:59:30]  and, you know,  Washington State  and trying to practice law in New Orleans.  Right?  I've got to ask,  how have you been since celebrity rehab?  Because we all saw you on TV there.  Wow.  Well, I never really saw it  except for a little bit.  I asked my brother,  I said,  tell me about the parts where I look good.  And he went,  well, there aren't any.  So,  tell me about the parts where I seem like  I got my shit together.  He went,  they're earning me.  Those either?  Oh, my God.  He said,  tell me about the parts where he said,  Tom,  it's a goddamn, 
[03:00:00]  it's a train wreck, man.  Okay, dude,  don't watch it.  You made for some good TV.  Holy shit,  you're pretty fucked up.  I don't know what good TV,  I don't know necessarily being well.  Well, I mean,  it was entertaining from where I said that.  You're a real asshole.  Thank you,  by the way.  And I certainly hope you're doing okay.  I'm joking, Opie.  Yeah, I know.  I'm two years and 117 days clean today.  Oh, wow, shit.  Because of celebrity rehab?  Not just because of celebrity rehab,  it was the,  it was just time.  The icebreaker. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah, that was it.  It was the first step.  I was tired of it.  I had called Drew before that show  when I was begging him  to take me to treatment.  I'm bad, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's another thing.  It was so public.  And it seemed to have come out of nowhere  because everybody knew Tom Sizemore as,  wow, this guy's a really good fucking actor.  Great career, great movies.  The TMZ Life We Live Now, 
[03:01:00]  they are the,  hey, look,  they're the shot callers.  Whatever they print,  everybody runs with it.  Right.  Yeah, it's true no matter what.  They could say that mongoloids,  mongoloids serial killers  loose in the Empire State Building.  Yeah.  And they're going to evacuate it.  Right.  Yes.  And maybe tear it down.  Right.  Now, because they go first,  everybody follows.  Right.  And because of the internet  and this great information highway of bullshit, 
[03:01:30]  which is largely about sex and bullshit,  because I call it sex shit.  And you have a bunch of bullshit.  And it's ugly.  And it's,  listen,  I've been out of the game for a while  and I did not know that we were living in a world  where every goddamn move you make  is documented.  Yep.  And if you're a celebrity  and you're someone they don't like  or you've had some problems,  listen,  I didn't enjoy until I was 35 years old.  Wow.  Okay,  so it's not all I ever did with my life. 
[03:02:00]  Yeah.  We're talking about seven years of my life  that,  for whatever reason,  have been made my life.  Right.  So the other 42 years of my life,  I guess I didn't do a goddamn thing.  You know,  so they can kiss my ass  and they're liars.  I'm not a liar.  Whenever I've been asked  if I'm doing something wrong by the police  whenever I was having problems,  I said yes.  Except for the prosthetic penis.  I admit to that mistake. 
[03:02:30]  I thought I was clever  and I realized I wasn't.  That was a good one.  God damn,  that was a good one.  I gotta tell you the truth.  I was lying then  that that was my penis.  I tried to say I had two of them  and that's why I was popular  and they didn't believe me.  Oh my God.  But that was 2005.  Yeah.  And since then,  and since then,  I've been at least,  you know,  someone said,  look,  it was obvious  I was having enormous problems.  But I'm addressing them. 
[03:03:00]  Right.  And unlike F. Scott Fitzgerald  who didn't have a second actor  for all you nitwit kids out there,  I'm in a bad mood right now.  For all you nitwit's under 30 out there,  there's a guy named F. Scott Fitzgerald.  He was a writer.  He wrote books.  Ever heard of those?  Fiction.  The Great Gatsby.  And he claimed  there were no second acts  in American life.  And he meant this,  that if once you made a mistake  in your life,  if you were a celebrated person,  you wouldn't get a chance  to be a celebrated person again.  Unfortunately,  F. Scott Fitzgerald, 
[03:03:30]  I think he died at 35.  Jesus.  So he didn't live to know  if there was a second act  in American life.  And I hazard to say  that there are second acts.  Witness Mickey Rourke  and Robert Downey Jr.  I'm counting with other people  that we don't know of  that aren't famous  that have problems  with addiction  or problems with  all kinds of things.  Depression, etc.  Right.  Since you quit,  have you picked up  anything else?  I played the guitar  really badly.  Is that more of an addiction?  I played it once for like,  I played the guitar  for like seven months in a row.  Like almost all day.  And you're still not good at it?  I still don't even good at it. 
[03:04:00]  I can't even play a bar chord yet.  Tom.  I'm just getting into these.  Just so you know,  sober, sober.  To your left and to your right.  So they understand  what you're talking about.  Oh yeah.  Well, the habits,  it's the...  Theism.  It's the addiction.  The addictive behavior  just goes...  The rituals.  The rituals.  It's the rituals.  For me,  you know what blew my mind  is when I decided  I'm not going to do this drug anymore  when I went to bed?  And when I got up,  I tried really hard enough to do it  and then I did it.  And I'm very willful. 
[03:04:30]  I could,  I could,  you know,  I could get things.  If I said I'm not going to do this  or I'm going to do that,  I would do it.  But I couldn't do that.  And I knew that a long time ago.  Wow.  I knew I was in trouble  because  I was really,  I honestly did not want to do it.  And I could not not do it.  Yeah.  And then I was really ashamed.  First it was just,  oh my God,  I was afraid.  And so I was still enjoying it.  And then the shame factor kicks in  when you're,  so I got a couple people in my family  who are just like, 
[03:05:00]  don't believe in this addiction model.  They're like,  you're fucked up, man.  Get your ass straight.  And they think you're lying.  They think you're lying  and you're fucked up, man.  There's something fucking wrong with you.  What the fuck is wrong with you, man?  You weak fucking punk ass bitch.  I got talked to like that.  And you know,  your mother hasn't slept in three, four years,  you motherfucker.  You're going to do this shit again  once you go hang yourself.  Jesus.  And I'm from Detroit.  I'm from,  you know,  they didn't mean it literally,  but they were disgusted with me.  Right.  And because of the,  I did some of those things. 
[03:05:30]  You know,  I was doing drugs,  but I didn't do a lot of things I said I did.  Whatever.  Addiction is a disease.  because I know it is now  because of Dr. Drew.  And do you believe it's a disease?  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  I have a genetic predisposition  to narcotics,  to any kind of mood-altering substance.  I find any addictive behavior.  I was going to say,  mood-altering behaviors.  Sex is an addiction. 
[03:06:00]  Food.  Food is an addiction.  TV is an addiction.  Money is an addiction.  A lot of things.  Is Twitter?  Yeah.  I don't Twitter.  And I don't text.  Text is for broads.  I don't get this texting thing.  I got out of rehab.  I didn't know what texting was.  Yeah,  but I'm telling you one thing.  Texting is for broads.  It may be so,  but once I realize I can take pictures of my cock  with a cell phone,  once you can send cock photos,  texting gets on a whole new meaning.  Brett Favre and Anthony Weir.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a really smart thing to do.  I'm going to do that.  You got a cell phone on you?  I do.  I'd love a photo of your cock.  I'd have respect. 
[03:06:30]  Why are you?  That's called taking pictures of your cock.  I don't think about texting.  Texting's an addiction  that this whole country's beset with.  Yeah.  Now,  I texted briefly when I got out of rehab,  and I realized that the information  that was being shared was totally innocuous  and could best be relayed,  whatever was important in it,  which was usually nothing,  in a phone conversation.  Yeah.  It would be far briefer,  and all you had to do was hit one number.  Right.  So I don't understand that.  I do think that people don't want to live anymore. 
[03:07:00]  They want to do this.  They want to talk about life.  And it's a really bizarre addiction.  Instead of getting out and actually doing something.  I've seen...  Listen,  I got into a text world with somebody once.  That never happens.  Seems like you text a lot for a guy that doesn't text.  This is when I first...  I don't text anymore.  Here are my standard responses now.  Yeah.  I'm sorry I'm late.  Yeah.  I didn't do it.  I'm kidding.  No,  no yes,  maybe,  I don't know,  maybe, 
[03:07:30]  call Charles,  I'm not home.  I get that.  And people get mad at you  if you only text a couple words.  But that's all you need to do with that shit.  I get back from certain guys like,  what the fuck's wrong with you?  Yeah,  exactly.  And I go,  I'm not home.  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  So you're on the phone,  guys.  I actually learned that.  I'm not on the phone either.  I hate phones.  Oh,  you do?  I never had a cell phone until 2004.  How do you like to communicate?  You just one-on-one in person?  Listen,  Abraham Lincoln did fine  without phones. 
[03:08:00]  I mean,  what has to be,  the real important,  until he got to the theater.  Maybe someone would have warned him there,  Tom.  If his guard hadn't been drunk,  his guard hadn't been texting the guy at the bar  to bring some more food,  and hadn't fallen asleep,  and John Booth wouldn't have gotten by him.  Dr. Conrad Murray,  he's not a criminal.  In any event,  I don't text.  Okay.  Can I?  What was it?  We were saying something else.  Addiction.  I can handle things on the phone.  Usually, 
[03:08:30]  the really important shit  that has to be communicated to you,  Opie,  in your job,  for instance,  by your wife or girlfriend,  they're going to get a hold of you  no matter what.  There you go.  Right?  Yeah.  Right?  Absolutely.  Yeah, that's true.  They have beforehand  when there was just one phone in your house.  Well, in 1985,  when all of us were alive here,  living in New York,  when I was,  and you guys were,  we didn't have cell phones.  No.  No.  Did we get to our appointments on time?  You can't picture life without it anymore,  did you have a cell phone in 85?  I had the fear of criminal.  One of the big ones.  Yeah, he is.  How big was it?  Yeah, he's Canon.  He had a fucking car phone. 
[03:09:00]  Canon.  Mannix.  Listen,  we got Jimmy Fallon on the line.  He just wants to promote some really fast.  Okay.  And Tom Sizemore's here.  We want to talk to him about everything.  Kawhi 5-0, don't we?  Yeah, of course we do.  Love it.  Jimmy.  Sorry, this is the operator speaking.  His line disconnected.  That's it.  The operator speaking.  Who is Jimmy Fallon?  Jimmy Fallon.  Fallon?  Oh!  See, I've been out of pop culture for a minute.  Yeah.  Did we lose Jimmy then, I guess?  Yeah, I guess we did.  He was on hold for a while.  He's doing Pink Floyd week on his show,  and he just wanted to promote it real fast. 
[03:09:30]  Sorry, Tom.  Jimmy Fallon from SNL.  Is he Jimmy Kimmel?  No.  That's the sports writer.  That's the talk show host.  Yes.  He's actually funny.  Jimmy Fallon's the talk show host from SNL.  Oh, I know he is.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he's funny, too.  Yeah, he's great.  He's a talented guy.  It really is.  How hard is it to get back into getting a gig?  Like, you've got on Hawaii 5-0, which is, I mean, a huge show.  So, great gig.  Was it hard to convince people, look, I'm not fucking up at this point?  I guess so.  I mean, yeah. 
[03:10:00]  It was difficult, I would gather, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, you have to, I mean, these guys are sober.  Yeah.  Do you think I'm sober?  You seem sober, but I don't know you're drunk, so, but I've, yeah.  I'm not drunk.  I'm not drunk.  But you seem sober.  Like, I wouldn't, I don't know you, but I would believe you if you said you're sober,  sure.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can see it in your eyes.  Or no reason not to.  You can see it in the eyes.  Yeah.  Usually you can see it in the eyes.  Yeah, the eyes.  Because the pupils are too big or too small.  Yeah. 
[03:10:30]  And they flicker.  Oh, really?  Generally speaking, that's how you can tell.  Yeah.  The cops will put the light in your eyes.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And that's how they do it.  Yeah.  And mine are proper.  You can't tell it to a studio executive.  What I just did with these guys.  That's not going to be your job, okay?  It's not that easy.  But you are a good actor, too, so.  No, but you can't tell it to a studio executive.  What I had to do was, not to get sanctimonious, but my manager and agent, Charles Leggo, and Cynthia 
[03:11:00]  Booth just kept pushing on a job called Exit Strategy, which was a pilot.  It was the most highly anticipated pilot of the season with Ethan Hawke, and I played  the second lead ultimately, and it wasn't picked up for whatever reason.  Was it a military thing?  No, it was about black ops who go into, let's say you were working for the CIA and you were  spying on the Soviets or whatever, and you got made.  We would go and get you and have an exit strategy. 
[03:11:30]  I did well in the show, and Heather Caden, who I'd like to thank, too, and Peter Lenkoff,  but Heather Caden has been my champion.  She took my scenes from Exit Strategy, and she took them over to Peter Lenkoff, the exec  producer at Hawaii Five-0 over at Paramount, and she's at Fox, and she took my scenes over  there and showed them to him.  After the show wasn't picked up, I didn't know she'd done that.  And then I was asked in by Peter Lenkoff, and I was hired. 
[03:12:00]  Did they offer it to you, or did they ever ask you to read at this point?  I read for Exit Strategy, but I didn't read for Hawaii Five-0.  Are you insulted when they asked you to read, or no?  No.  No, not after what I've been through, no.  Okay.  Because you know it's not, they're just seeing, like, you know, is he ready to work?  I saw the episode of Hawaii Five-0.  I'm a big, that's one of my favorite shows.  I watch it every Monday night, I watch it, me and my wife, Hawaii Five-0, and Mike and  Molly.  Let's not forget that.  I want to thank everybody on that show, and Alex and everybody, Jimmy, and Scotty, and  all the people. 
[03:12:30]  But when he came on, it was like one of those moments where you don't see him.  You see the back of his head, and you're like, who the fuck is that?  And then he's doing this thing with his finger, what the fuck?  And then it turns around, and it's like, oh, shit!  Hey, Tom is on fucking, you know what I mean?  Because I'm a big fan of the show, so it's like, this fucking Sizemore's on fuck, so  you know it's, like, going to get fucked up, because, you know, you're a great, you're  one of my favorite actors.  You're a fucking great actor.  Thank you very much.  It's now that, you know that show's legit when they start getting those people on. 
[03:13:00]  Billy Baldwin, who I, my next episode, he's on next week, but I'm not on the next two  weeks, but I'm on the following week, and I'm going back to do another one, and I hope  some more.  But Billy and I have a great episode together, and that's the fifth episode.  Of the season, you'll really like it, if you like the show.  Yeah, he's coming on next week, right?  I don't know if Billy's on next week.  Billy's on next week, yeah.  Yeah, and he's my ex-partner.  I don't want to spell it for you.  It's a cool, it's a cool, it's a cool little arc.  Okay, cool, yeah.  Can I ask you an acting question?  No.  How do you do it?  It's a no.  It's a no.  It's a no. 
[03:13:30]  No, I've said no.  I've been in prison.  It's a no.  It's a no.  It's a, it's a, it's a, because a guy like you, who is so good, like, in Natural Born Killers,  I'm not that good.  Oh, dude, you're great.  You really are.  You're one of the great, great actors, man.  He's one of the greatest actors of our generation.  And, and, when you, when you, do you, do you go like, kind of like Brando would just  never be off book.  What's that?  Are you off, like, do you, is it important for you to memorize the script first?  I may do a play about Marlon Brando.  Oh, really?  That my manager, Charles England, who was Marlon's, one of his dearest friends, interviewed 
[03:14:00]  Marlon the last, I think it was three, four months of his life.  He actually held his hand when he passed, and he's written a play about these interviews  he had with him.  And, and I'm hoping to do this play, um, within the year, and we do it someplace small, initially  like Minneapolis, and hoping to move it to Broadway.  I play, uh, play, I play Mr. Brando.  But, do I, um, do you play Mr. Brando?  Is it important to you to memorize the script first?  When I met Mr. Brando, you know what he said to me?  And I spoke to him a little bit, he went, well, you know, Tom, you know, one of those  days, maybe I'll mature and quit acting and become a man. 
[03:14:30]  Unlike myself.  Quit acting and become a man?  Unlike myself.  I mean, he, I don't think he saw himself clearly.  No, huh?  And, uh, I told him earlier, and he went, you know, um, I'm not sure what I'm, you know,  whatever, um.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, I wrote that shit down, and I was like, uh, Bob, what does this mean?  Is this some cryptic, cryptic coalition you belong to? 
[03:15:00]  You want an interpreter for me?  You know, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um,  I'm not sure, fuck it, um, am I missing something here?  And he went, he went, ah, cryptic coalition, I'm a cryptic coalition.  I said, will you interpret this for me?  He went, fuck you, no.  So what is, Jimmy, you want to know if he, if he memorizes his lines?  Is it important to you?  Because, like, Brando would just kind of want to see, like, do the script, or you have to, 
[03:15:30]  you have to know every line?  I think preparation, preparation allows you the opportunity to, um, to, to play your jazz, so to speak.  Okay.  So if you know your, if you know your instrument, you know, if you can, if you can play the guitar,  I can't play it well, if you're, um, you know what I mean, if you really know something well,  you can then riff.  If you know an offense, a football offense, really well, then you can, um, you can...  Work around it.  Work around it.  You know, you...  Work around it's what you got.  Yeah, you know, because you, you, you, you, you know it so well. 
[03:16:00]  So I like to know what, um, I like to know it crystal clear.  Right.  And then if it takes a, if it goes somewhere, if I have the, um, permission per the director  to do that, then, uh, I might go that way.  Have you ever been intimidated in a scene with somebody, somebody you wanted to work with  and working with and, uh, kind of freaked you out, like, I'm actually working with this  person?  Um, no, I got more excited.  It was with Bob De Niro and, um, Heat.  And it was more exciting than it was intimidating. 
[03:16:30]  Wow.  Jesus.  Yeah, I get nervous.  I like that one.  Yeah, you've been in some fucking great movies.  I get nervous too.  I just have little lines up.  I get, if there was a camera, TV camera, if there was a TV camera in here, I might be  really, really nervous.  Really?  Yeah.  I, I'm, I do acting better, I act well better than I do life, but we're really working  hard on doing life as well as we do the other thing, if not better.  And that's what I'm working on really is, um, learning how to live, you know, a healthy  life with my two six-year-old sons and just making right actions and you do right actions, 
[03:17:00]  right things happen.  Yeah, it's easier being sober.  Oh my God.  Think about all the things you don't got to do.  You don't got to think about it for a second.  All the time.  Yeah.  Oh, that's copping.  Time-consuming activity.  Oh, that's copping.  I mean, no matter how much money you have, the guys you cop from don't have enough to  cop.  I want to cop for five years.  I don't have to cop anymore.  I don't have dope for five years.  Give me five years.  I never said that, but I, Keith Richards said it too.  In the Keith book, he wanted five years of heroin. 
[03:17:30]  The guy went, hey dude, you know, I'll make five years of heroin.  Five years of heroin.  He wanted five years of heroin.  You know what my habit is.  I want five years of heroin, man.  I don't want to buy them all.  People love that book.  I got to fucking read it.  I read it twice in a row.  That's good idea.  I finished it and I started it right over again.  Really?  It's that good.  And I like to read.  You can relate to a lot of stuff in there?  No, it's not just that.  It's him.  Being honest.  It's him being honest.  It's the period.  It's a big seismic shift in America and in London and Western culture. 
[03:18:00]  And he didn't forget a damn thing.  Yeah.  And he writes it on the back of the book.  He goes, as hard as this made me believe, I haven't forgotten a thing.  Not a word or sentence or anything that happened.  Especially Mick.  Wow.  Wow.  And he hasn't.  And he hasn't.  And the other guys in the band have said, now that he said that, that is exactly what happened.  What does he think of Mick?  You can give away.  Read the book.  I'm going to read that way.  We know what they think of each other. 
[03:18:30]  Mick's in with a new band already.  Mick's in with a new band for a while, but he just announced he's going out with...  It's better than Rolling Stone.  But they were good for each other for so many years.  I think they're going to stay together.  I think they'll go tour again.  I think they will.  Yeah.  If not, if not, for no other reason, because Keith loves it so much.  Keith loves to be a Rolling Stone.  He's the only guy that can tell Mick to go fuck himself and kind of get away.  And at the end of the book, it's really uplifting.  He says, I'm following what I always wanted to be.  I'm a good husband, a good son, and a good man.  And I'm playing dominoes with my dad. 
[03:19:00]  His father's still alive.  Well, right near the end of the book, he was, yeah.  I met Mr. Richards, and he plays dominoes all day with his pop.  Right.  Wow.  Yeah, I actually was.  He's a real British guy.  Yeah, sure.  I start with a shepherd's pie.  You don't mess with a shepherd's pie.  I mean, really seriously, if there's a shepherd's pie made, you don't touch it.  Really?  He dips into it first.  And he's just really cool.  That fucking book is intimidating, man, Tom.  Oh, man, you'll love that book.  It's thick, Tom.  And it's Keith-speak, though. 
[03:19:30]  It might be 600 pages.  It's 629 pages.  It's 629 pages.  I like the good 225.  Is there 200?  You like 25 pages of a book?  A 225 book.  Oh, 225.  Yeah, 225 is about my range, too.  Yeah, I know I could read it while I'm shitting for like two weeks, so I'll be finished.  Maybe there's 230 pages.  Big Lights, Big City.  What was it called?  What?  Bright Lights, Big City?  Yeah, you like that book a lot.  I never read it.  I can't read it.  172 pages.  Oh, that's two shits.  That's beautiful.  Two shit shakers.  Wow, yeah.  You're out.  You know, with the Keith book, if there's 230 pages of pictures, I might be in.  No, there's not 230 pages of pictures. 
[03:20:00]  There's like 18.  So I've got to read over 600 pages.  That's a real biography.  Well, you know what you can do with that book?  You know what you can do?  Because I did try to go through it a third time.  Yeah.  And I didn't.  You know, I read it twice in a row.  I really did.  You can skip around.  But I already read it, so I don't know if you can skip around.  I don't like that early year shit when you get into that.  Why don't you know?  The family stuff.  Ah, a little bit.  Listen, he gets off.  He's into them touring by page 72.  Perfect.  I like that.  Yeah.  Get into the real shit.  They spend too much time talking about family.  A lot of biographies spend too much time talking about the history of the parents. 
[03:20:30]  Yeah, he gets in there.  He says some really important things about his mother and father and the way he grew up.  And then, bam, he meets Mick.  Okay.  I'm going to read this book because of Tom Sizemore now.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  You make it seem like it.  It's one of the best celebrity books you'll ever read in your life.  That's what everyone's saying.  And it's also about the 60s, the 70s, and drugs.  Big Stones fan, Tom?  I was never a really, truly huge Stones fan, but there are certain parts of the Stones that  I love, but I always thought he had, there was something honest about him, even with his  troubled life when I was a teenager. 
[03:21:00]  And then when I met him, finally, he was just such a gentleman and such a kind guy.  Right.  And, you know, he's magnanimous, he's generous, and he's, I think he's completely monogamous  with his, Miss Pallenberg said he was, and I think his wife now, we all know who she is.  What's your favorite Stones song?  Tough, I know it's tough, because there's so many. 
[03:21:30]  Give me a couple.  Give Me Shelter, Angie, Angie, Hear Me Knocking, Exile on Main Street, Angie, Give Me Shelter,  Get Off My Cloud, Miss Satisfaction, there's a lot, Street Fighting Man.  Yeah, it's hard to pick a favorite Stones song.  Give Me Shelter is a great song.  Give Me Shelter is a great song.  That's a key song.  Really?  All children, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away.  It was after the Kent State incident, and they did that at Altamont. 
[03:22:00]  The first time they ever did it was at Altamont, when the incident happened with the gentleman,  Meredith.  The stabbing.  Right, I got stabbed.  Meredith, what's his name?  He got stabbed by the Hells Angels.  Wow.  Hey, you, as an actor, have you noticed in the time that you've been working how content  has changed a little bit, or the softening of certain content in the writing?  I'm trying to get used to this new pop culture of basic soft shit.  It's awful, isn't it?  I don't know if it's awful, it's just a different kind of shit.  It's mindless.  Well, I don't think we knew that...  There's no depth to a lot of the entertainment. 
[03:22:30]  Well, Opie, I don't want to say it, because I don't want to...  I've got to be nice.  I shouldn't be saying this.  I'll say it for you.  You don't even have to agree, because there's no depth.  Listen, um...  The Kardashians are really famous, and I'm obsessed, because I don't even know why.  That's what I'm talking about.  I'm not talking about Hawaii Five-O, and I'm not talking about...  Oh, no, no, I know.  I'm talking about that kind of stuff.  I'm talking about the TMZ...  I'm calling it the TMZ...  The TMZ culture.  The new information TMZ culture.  Right.  And the information sex shit highway. 
[03:23:00]  Where someone like Kim Kardashian is ridiculously famous.  A goddamn star.  And I don't know why.  I don't know why.  Yes, she's beautiful.  Yes.  She literally knows she gives good head.  She does.  Paris does.  That's why I like Paris Hilton, because she was a trooper.  Like, that video...  That was a very sexy video.  But that shouldn't necessarily make you a...  A star.  A pop icon?  Right.  I don't know.  I might disagree.  It used to be you kind of had to be like John Lennon.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, I kind of like Bob Dylan better than her.  Yeah.  He's written better songs than her.  Certainly.  I don't know.  That one, The Stars Shine, is a good song. 
[03:23:30]  Well, I kind of...  Dylan rules.  I like her rolling swing better.  And, um...  I like...  I like...  Subterranean?  Homesick Blues?  I like that better.  I like Blonde on Blonde better.  I like Blonde on Tracks.  How's the Rising Sun?  I like a lot of Dylan songs better.  Perhaps all of his songs are better than her songs.  John Wesley Harding is better.  Yeah.  Ballad and Plain D is better.  All Along the Watchtower.  Two Ramones better.  I think I'm out of Dylan songs.  I don't know that many.  I know a lot of them.  Yeah.  I'm a Dylan fanatic.  I've kind of started to like him more later in life. 
[03:24:00]  Most of the time is better.  Most of the time, one of the best songs ever written.  It's buried on...  You ever watch...  Most of the time, it's on...  You ever hear his radio show?  Oh, yeah.  He's just there.  That radio show is bomb.  It's fucking ruled.  I don't think it's around anymore.  I got to tell you, you know.  Yeah.  It's that voice.  It was just a bunch of shit, you know.  Yeah.  I'm a troubadour.  That's what he said.  You got him down.  I'm a troubadour.  Look, I couldn't do it again.  It was magic, you know.  Did you see the interview he did with...  With...  Ed Bradley? 
[03:24:30]  Mm-mm.  It's a very great interview.  You should see it.  It's on 60 Minutes.  And...  It was...  Mr. Bradley's passed away.  But the very end of the interview, he's talking to Bob, and he goes, okay, how do we end this?  What do you want to say?  And Bob goes, well, you know what?  On the way over here, I was in the cab, and I was stomped over there in Central Park South,  and I looked out of the window, and I saw these kids playing Frisbee there in Shepard's... 
[03:25:00]  Shepard's...  What's it called?  I don't know.  Shepard's Meadow or Sheep's Meadow?  Oh, Sheep's Meadow.  Sheep's Meadow.  And I saw him playing Frisbee, and the Frisbee went over this kid's head, and it came all the way out to the curb.  And I saw him run up the hill, and he couldn't have been 20 years old, and I looked at him,  and he looked up, and the light was going to turn green, and I said, hang on.  And I looked at him again, and I thought, he's 19, 20 years old.  And I thought of myself at 19 and 20, and, oh, God, how I'm missing it. 
[03:25:30]  And he went, what are you trying to say?  And he went, oh, I'm saying I'd like to be 19 or 20 again, I guess.  He goes, okay, you can go back and be 19 or 20 again, but no guarantee you'll be Bob Dylan.  In a second, he goes, in a second.  Oh, fuck, yeah.  And Bradley can't believe it.  He goes, you trade in.  And he goes, in a second.  This is one of the songs in media.  And he goes, in a second.  Wow.  I love that. 
[03:26:00]  So that says a lot about the man in a way.  Fuck yeah.  And I'm not sure if it's either good nor bad.  It's just he'd rather live it all over again.  Right.  How old is Bob Dylan?  72.  72?  No, 70.  70.  I wonder if you start thinking that way when you get to that age.  I wonder if that's normal.  He's still out 132 days a year.  Sure.  Like, would most people, like say a Jagger even, or Keith Richards, would they feel the  same way as they hit 70 or 75?  Maybe that's normal.  Dude, I would.  Your accomplishments mean nothing because you realize that most of your life is there. 
[03:26:30]  Listen, I'm 49.  I'm halfway to dead.  Or two-thirds of the way to dead, really.  So, um.  I would take years in a second.  I take it.  I take it.  I go back.  I'll fucking second.  I go back to 19 in a second.  I don't know.  Oh, in a second.  Just for the, um.  Do you get a little knowledge with you to take back?  Oh, no, no, no.  You can't take any of that with you.  No knowledge.  No knowledge.  Just 19 again.  Just the wonder.  The rebirth of wonder.  Nice.  That's a good time.  I wouldn't do it.  I like my life.  I really do.  I like my life, too.  I kind of like it.  I don't think I'd go back.  The feel that rebirth.  It wouldn't be a rebirth. 
[03:27:00]  It would be the birth of wonder over again.  Because when I first moved to New York, it was like a kaleidoscope of great things.  Right.  I was from Detroit, and it was just gray.  And I came here, and it was just a kaleidoscope of beauty, I thought.  So I was scared and unhappy at that time.  And self-hating.  And I didn't like it when I was 19.  I got sober.  I was actually sober when I was 18.  But I've been sober, too.  Yeah, I was still sober since 18.  I got sober when I was 15.  Yeah.  These two guys got sober really, really early there.  But I wouldn't want to be 19 again.  That sucked.  But going to meetings and trying to get all fucked up. 
[03:27:30]  Not knowing how to bang chicks.  Sober dances.  Walking up to girls and trying to talk about God.  What are you doing?  Higher power.  What were you doing?  Hoving gasoline?  No, alcohol and drugs.  I did everything.  Mainly alcohol and coke.  You were that bad a kid?  Yeah.  At that age?  How did you find that stuff so early?  I just hung out with the wrong kids.  But it was easy.  Where were you from?  Boston?  Yeah.  How did you know?  The B on your hat and your accent?  My shitty accent?  Bobby.  Bobby, you have a B on your hat. 
[03:28:00]  You have a Boston red-sized hat and you have a Boston accent.  Besides that, I didn't just guess.  Did Bobby really go out?  Yeah, exactly.  It was either Moscow or Boston.  It was like Red Auerbach going, how did you know I was the GM of the Celtics?  Fuck, Bobby.  I forgot I had a hat on.  I know you love Y5-0.  It's like Parcells saying, how did you know I coached a Giants?  You got a Giants cap on.  It's like I have a mirror in front of me.  I forgot I had a hat on.  Oh, my God.  It was a Boston hat.  I fucking know.  My eyes are a mirror.  You still got the accent.  That's funny.  My eyes are a mirror.  That's funny.  He goes, you dumb B on your hat and you have a stupid accent. 
[03:28:30]  I didn't say that.  No, that's what he said.  I said that.  I imagine, too.  But that's what he heard.  He's one of my best friends.  That's what Bobby hears.  That's it.  That's what I hear.  That's how he hears it.  I said, can you tell the lesson it is?  It is really funny.  He's a very nice guy, too.  If I could go back and do it all over again, I'd do that.  Do what over again?  The whole life.  I wouldn't go back to 19 because it sucked.  But if I could go back to like four or two.  It didn't suck for Dylan.  He had arrived in New York at 19. 
[03:29:00]  He was already a superstar.  No, he wasn't.  At 19?  Right prior to it.  He was right prior.  He was talking about being right prior to the stardom.  When did he hit?  At 19.  Almost 20.  Okay.  He went into the studio and did the first record,  which was The Free Will and Bob Dylan.  When was he with...  He's been out of 50 years.  Suzy Rotolo?  No, I was saying about Joan Baez.  When was that time?  Right after Suzy Rotolo.  Suzy Rotolo is the gal who's with him on The Free Will and Bob Dylan,  the album cover.  That's Suzy Rotolo and that is... 
[03:29:30]  I think it's Greenwich Avenue or Perry or Hudson.  I'm not sure which street it is.  It's downtown.  It's downtown.  And that was his love of his life at that point.  And Joan Baez, I'm not sure, was a lover.  I don't know.  But he met her at the Newport Jazz Festival and they did it with God on our side.  He played it for her.  She had heard of him, of course, and he played with God on our side and she thought he was  touched by him.  You think Dylan gets the proper respect?  I don't think he can get enough. 
[03:30:00]  I think he's the greatest artist of the 20th century.  I can't deny that.  I mean, he's one of the greater ones.  I mean, he's got to be in the top kind of five.  And Manny wouldn't put him on stage.  Manny, who used to own the Comedy Cellar, which we work at, owned Cafe Fiend John.  And Dylan came in in the 60s when he was young and unknown.  And Manny laughed about it later in life, like what a dope I was to not see who this guy was.  But he just didn't like him.  He's like, nah, I didn't think he was very good.  And he just wouldn't put him on.  And Dylan talked about him in his biography.  Can I say something about a friend of mine who's gone?  And I never talk about him, really, because it's so sad. 
[03:30:30]  Jeff Buckley was a friend of mine.  And he was only in the public eye very briefly.  He did an album called Grace.  And he drowned in Tennessee.  He's doing a record.  And I just wanted to say that Jeff Buckley had Dylan-like qualities and Dylan talent.  But he had a better voice.  Do you guys remember who he was?  I don't know.  Yeah.  He did a version of Hallelujah that's hard to beat.  Lover, you should have come over.  Go on YouTube and go, Jeff Buckley Live in Chicago.  And I guarantee you'll be hooked.  Let's do Jeff Buckley as we leave the show. 
[03:31:00]  Hallelujah.  Jeff Buckley's performance right off the album, off of Grace.  You hear that, E-Rock?  He's just laughing in there.  E-Rock, do you hear that?  We only have time for like one more minute, by the way.  They're telling us at 10 o'clock he has to go.  I don't have to go.  Oh, yeah?  That's what they would tell me.  If my manager said so, I have to go.  I believe it's coming from outside.  It's coming from my manager.  I have to go.  But I want to send out my condolences to Mrs. Buckley.  Tim Buckley was a contemporary of Bob's, and he passed too.  Did they ever figure out what happened to Jeff Buckley?  He drowned.  No, I know he drowned, but was he on something? 
[03:31:30]  I mean, or you don't want to talk about it.  That's fair.  Yeah.  Okay.  No worries.  He was a sweetheart.  I saw him at the...  No worries.  And I knew him before, and he was an angel.  I understand.  Okay.  And Tom is promoted just to...  No, no, no, but I wanted to say...  Oh, yeah, go ahead.  No, no, no.  It's slumber...  Slumber...  Slumber...  Oh, you're...  Wait, I'm confused.  I don't know.  Tom's looking at his own bio that we have. 
[03:32:00]  Obviously, Hawaii Five-0 is Mondays at 10 on CBS.  Wait, what are we looking for, Tom?  Tom's looking through...  I'm looking for the name of...  Our one sheet about him.  Vincent Fryer is the character I play on Hawaii Five-0.  Right.  And that's the...  I'm the head of internal affairs, and Slumber Party Slaughter is a movie that I did with Ryan O'Neill and Keith Carradine and Rebecca.  I'm just going to call her Rebecca because she's my dear friend and my biggest champ...  One of my bigger champions, her and Heather Caden. 
[03:32:30]  And it sounds like a silly title, but it's a really wonderful movie, and Rebecca directed the movie.  Rebecca Chaney is her name, and it's a terrific movie.  And Five-0 has been a great experience, and you liked it?  Oh, it's the first that last week was great.  No, Bobby raves about it.  You know, it's great because you can always tell a really good actor when they're on TV because TV actors sometimes just...  Because TV, you have to...  It's very quick shooting, you know, let's go, let's go, let's go. 
[03:33:00]  It's not like a film where you get to take your time and get into it, but you can always tell, like, Vince D'Anafrio or Tom's side.  They do these little hands...  These little things that make you go, who the fuck is that?  And then he turned around, and you're like, ah, shit.  I'm reading her high school journal, her high school yearbook.  Yeah, her yearbook, yeah.  And I'm just trying to psych her out a little bit, you know, too.  I mean, that was the idea.  Because I know she pulls her gun on me because I'm an intruder.  She's got her gun on the back, and she goes, I swear to you, I'm going to shoot you. 
[03:33:30]  And I go, hang on a second.  You certainly have a lot of people who care about you.  And I'm saying that because I'm not one of them.  And she's really good.  But everybody on 5.0, from my makeup artist, Jeff, and the hair department, and Heather, and Peter, and Steven, and the director of the episode with Billy and me, and Alex, and Scott, and D.D.K., have been wonderful.  It's been a great experience.  Good for you.  Do we have to wrap a tent or no?  Yeah, yeah.  We do?  Okay, because Tom has other press to do.  Yeah, your people are saying you've got to get out of here. 
[03:34:00]  Okay, he has to go ahead and just say it.  Tom, I like you, man.  I like Tom Sizemore.  Fuck yes.  Fucking Lully.  Monday nights.  Because you're an honest guy.  I like your honesty, which is very rare in a position like yours, sir.  Everything Tom does, you guys know, just support.  He's fucking brilliant.  And our fly fishing video is doing well, Bobby.  You fly fish, really?  Me and Bobby.  Bobby is really into it.  I go as a goof.  I want to do that.  It's great.  You should come with us.  Maybe I get your number when we wrap here.  Yeah.  Ever since I saw the movie with Brad, I've wanted to do it.  Yeah, we go up to Roscoe, New York.  I thought it was a joke, and then I went. 
[03:34:30]  Oh, it's beautiful, isn't it?  I really do like it.  I don't know if it'll become a hobby, but I'll go with Bobby every once in a while.  And we film videos and get really silly and stupid, so I don't get kicked out of motels.  And get kicked out of motels.  I can't do that.  No, I know.  By the way, I just want you to know how much it's going to upset me if you actually become  friends with Tom Sizemore and go fly fishing.  I'm going to go fly.  I'm going to go fly.  But just don't go with him.  No, I am.  That'll make me very jealous.  Well, how am I going with him?  We'll take you with you.  We'll take you and come.  Okay, let's all do that.  You come with me.  I don't know.  Oh, gee.  You can't do that.  We can't get him to go fly.  I'm sure he can go now. 
[03:35:00]  As one of my best friends, he won't go fly fishing with me.  He'll go fly fishing with me.  If you're there, he'll come.  I'd actually buy a boat and bring it up.  Come on, Tom.  Let's go.  Me and you, buddy.  You're bullshitting me.  You know that.  This asshole won't go fly fishing with us, but fuck.  We'll see you guys.  We'll go fly fishing with Tom Sizemore, Bobby.  I know it now.  Thanks, Opie.  See you guys.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Sirius XM.  Throw it away just because, you know.  Absolutely not.  Of the big choke. 
[03:35:30]  A-Rod did not do well.  He let you guys down.  We're used to it.  Are you used to the A-Rod choking?  I support the city.  You know what I'm saying?  I'm wearing the hat in support of the city.  Oh, there you go.  Not necessarily the Yankees.  Not just the team.  Yeah.  Also, you're not really a fan.  Are you a fan?  I mean, no.  I mean, I know some of those guys.  I'm not a fan of baseball.  No?  I'm a football, basketball guy.  But, you know what I'm saying?  I'm a fan of New York, though. 
[03:36:00]  What's your teams, football and basketball?  Well, football, definitely.  Well, first of all, for both teams, you've got the Hawks and the Falcons.  Right.  But see, you know, then when you grow up in Atlanta and you have the history in sports that we have,  you have to definitely support your hometown team.  And then you have to actually pick somebody you think is going to win.  You know what I'm saying?  So, I like the Hawks. 
[03:36:30]  And then I also, I like the Heat, too.  When's the last time an Atlanta team won?  Well, the Braves always did pretty well, but you don't like baseball.  So, when's the last time the Falcons or the Hawks won?  Has it been forever?  Well, the Falcons actually made it to the Super Bowl in 2000, I think it was.  2000, 2001, something like that.  They lost.  Yeah, they didn't pull it off.  Atlanta is a big enough city that they should have some championships. 
[03:37:00]  They really should get the job done somehow.  Yeah, I think it's ownership, though.  I think it's the executive office.  Do you allow, like, a lot of musicians don't want their music used with certain athletes.  Do people use your music to walk out to, or you don't mind?  I don't mind at all, man.  If it inspires you and motivates you to get out there and become a champion,  then, you know, that was my intention.  That was my intention in making it in the first place.  I have a question, too, because I was reading something. 
[03:37:30]  Do you write down lyrics, or do you just kind of go from memory?  You know, it depends on the song.  It depends on the song.  If it's a more introspective, a detailed story, meticulous, you know, kind of story,  I do write it down.  But if it's just like a party record, or a record that I'm, you know,  I'm just all too experienced in making, I do that off the top. 
[03:38:00]  How good is your memory?  Because I really...  Pretty good.  Yeah?  Pretty good.  Did you ever come up with something you think is brilliant,  and you're like, oh, this is fucking great,  and then the next morning, you're like, I was fucked up.  I don't remember it.  I mean, you know, it happens to me a few different ways in different times.  There is no cookie-cutter way of it happening.  Sometimes I'll be, like, right here, and I come up with an idea,  and by the time I get in the car, I'll say, ah, I forgot.  And, you know, if I think hard enough about it, I'll remember it again.  And sometimes I go to sleep and I wake up remembering a song that I thought of in my sleep. 
[03:38:30]  Do you talk it into a recorder?  Do you have, like, a little thing that you'll talk something into?  Nah, you know, I used to try and do that.  I always lose those, though.  It didn't work out, man.  Do you have people around you, too?  It's like, I guess as a performer, do you have guys around you that if something's not good,  like, because we were talking about the original Star Wars,  they remade, they did The Phantom Menace, which I thought was terrible,  and George Lucas has nobody around him that just is going, ugh.  Right.  Fucking awful. 
[03:39:00]  A bunch of yes men.  You need friends around you who will say, hey, you suck.  That's career suicide.  Every so often.  Everybody just yeses you to death.  That's career suicide, yeah.  So you don't toss people out if they tell you unpleasant, uh...  Absolutely not.  Nah, man.  I mean, you know, honesty is definitely welcomed around me.  Honesty, integrity, and, you know, just a genuine spirit.  I think if you're confident enough in what you're doing, you could take criticism.  Absolutely.  And it's not, you know, the end of the world.  And if you want to be the best at what you do, you want to know when you're not at your best. 
[03:39:30]  And I know the difference between criticism and when some of these fucking fans are fucking with me.  So, yeah, that's kind of easy to distinguish.  Yeah, on Twitter, how bothered are you by, because sometimes you try to avoid it,  but how bothered are you by, like, people on Twitter who are attacking you or, like...  You know, I'm not.  You know, I mean, because you got to think about it.  Anybody who goes out of their way and takes time out of their day 
[03:40:00]  to come and say something negative to someone that they don't like,  that only speaks volumes as to how much of a life you don't have.  Because if I don't like you and I'm not interested in what you're doing and saying,  then I'm not going to tune in to where you are long enough to type a long, detailed...  I'm not even going to waste my characters on it.  You know what I'm saying?  So, I mean, that just... 
[03:40:30]  That speaks volumes as to what kind of people they are and what kind of life they don't have.  Sometimes they don't say one thing, though.  It kind of goes like, yeah, you son of a bitch.  Like, some of them are kind of good at getting, like, one little screw in there and you're like...  A little shot.  Yeah.  Yeah, you found it.  I do what you do, though.  I actually will...  I'll private message them something fucking horrific and then block them.  It really is satisfying.  Yeah, yeah.  Because nobody has to see my response to them.  Yeah, no one else sees the response.  You see it. 
[03:41:00]  You give them a good beating.  And then you just block them and go, yeah, take it easy.  That's it.  I don't have to see you anyway.  You see, I'm not as experienced in my Twitterfication.  Because he's actually working, Jim.  Yeah, I know.  You probably get more positive feedback than we do.  We're used to people hating our guts.  Doesn't it sound like all we do is deal with people you are like, you son of a bitch?  Well, it's the environment we're in.  He's not dealing with that crap.  It is very toxic in here.  He's too busy creating.  He's not tweeting as much as we are.  It really is, man. 
[03:41:30]  It's at Tip on Twitter, by the way.  Yeah, at Tip.  So how many followers you got?  1.3, 1.2 million, something like that.  That's got to be nice.  How many do you get?  136,000.  That's a lot.  You know, not compared to, a million is a lot.  A million is the benchmark.  Yeah.  I'm just getting to a million.  I'm just getting there.  Taylor Swift, I've seen her.  She has like 16 million, I think.  And nothing to say, by the way.  That's great.  That's the problem with a lot of those people. 
[03:42:00]  People with the most followers say the least interesting shit.  That's why I like 50 Cent, because he doesn't give any fucking positivity.  He just goes out and blasts people and goofs on shit.  And I kind of like that on Twitter.  Because I have nothing positive to say on Twitter.  I really don't.  It's everything I'm too afraid to say to people's face.  You're the same asshole that you get, only to other people.  That's what you do.  Yeah, but I use my real name.  The thing with Twitter is they can attack you anonymously.  I mean, that's cowardly.  Yeah.  That's cowardly.  I have a question about rap.  What's the difference?  Because I tweeted a joke about something, and some rapper got pissed off at me. 
[03:42:30]  What was the joke?  It was about Steve Jobs.  It was nothing that harsh.  But after he died, I just, you know.  Oh, man.  Yeah, I know.  I'm not saying it's pleasant, but it's what I did.  But he got mad at me, and my friend knows him, and he goes, well, it was a little back  and forth, but it wasn't a Twitter beef.  What exactly is the difference between a mild argument and a beef?  Because a beef is apparently really bad.  Oh, beef gets violent?  Violence.  Violence and threat of violence is probably the difference. 
[03:43:00]  Okay, so if there's a beef, there's a problem.  You don't want to ever have a beef then.  If we have a disagreement, that's one thing.  But then if you say, you know what?  It's on when I see you.  Okay, now it's a beef.  Oh, okay.  Then it's a beef.  Now, you're a guy that throws down.  I mean, you don't seem to back down for that.  No, I mean, a lot of guys get successful.  I mean, I've gotten a little old.  I've gotten a little old, man.  I'm up in age.  Mellowed a little with age.  Chilling out a little bit.  Start thinking about shit.  Yeah, man.  You know, there's too much going on out here, man. 
[03:43:30]  You know what I'm saying?  Too many other things to do.  Too many other ways to divide your time rather than be too focused in that.  But you still worked when you were in jail, it seemed like.  It's like you didn't just wither away.  It's like you still had projects going on and stuff coming out.  It was like you did more in jail than most people do on the streets.  That's amazing.  That always amazes me, man.  I try to stay busy, man.  I try to stay busy and productive.  I read some of the book.  We had it over the weekend. 
[03:44:00]  How much did you read?  About 20 pages.  What?  That's it?  Yeah.  I'll tell you why, though.  I'm preparing.  I'm interviewing Tony Iommi from Black Sabbath and Ace Frehley from Kewa, two of my childhood heroes.  Okay.  And they both have books.  So I've been obsessively because they're biographies.  All right.  Well, you get a pass.  But I have to say, okay, I'm not going to give away anything in the book.  I'm only going to talk about the first couple of pages.  But it really was much more, because look, I didn't know if it was geared towards me as a reader, much more than I thought.  By page, let's see, page five, I believe, the mother dies. 
[03:44:30]  And I'm not giving much to worry.  It's the opening of the book.  It's the first couple of pages.  By page six, the stepbrother and stepsister have sexual tension.  By page seven, they're fucking.  I loved what I read.  I really did.  He just sold you a few books.  I honestly mean that.  I couldn't believe that it went there that fast.  I'm like, this is fucking great.  It's like, let's not fuck around.  Let's get right into this.  I genuinely. 
[03:45:00]  I love books like that, though.  Not because you're a guest.  I genuinely want to keep reading this.  I couldn't believe when it's.  I thought it was going to be like, all right, is this a book for teenagers?  I could not believe it went in that direction so that fucking quickly.  I was like, wow, that's great.  The book's called Power and Beauty.  Yeah, Power and Beauty installs today.  It's about, would you say it's about two teenagers?  Obviously, they're both 16.  They're stepbrother and sister.  The mother is killed.  But not exactly stepbrother and sister.  I guess, you know, Beauty was adopted by Power's mom when her mom passed. 
[03:45:30]  So she, and that was when they were 11, 11, 12 years old.  So they have been living as brother and sister for four years at the time when, at the time when moms passed.  And so, you know, I guess that brought them together in a way and had them see each other.  Because at that point, they were all, they were all each other had, you know.  So I guess that allowed them to see each other in a way that I guess they'd never seen each other before. 
[03:46:00]  So, it's still nice to see something addressed, though, realistically or in a way you don't think it's going to be addressed.  Because the part I'm at now is the mother was good friends with the guy.  I think he's a pimp, Slim.  And Slim Simmons.  And he's trying to get them to move in with him.  He's got a big house.  And it's like there's an underlying thing, like I think, and again, I haven't read it far enough, but I think he wants to fuck the girl.  I mean, I think, of course, he wants to fuck the girl.  So he wants to stick the brother over the garage, you know.  And he wants to have the girl in the house with him.  And I'm like, I just love the fact that all of this is happening in the first 20 pages of the book. 
[03:46:30]  It's not fucking a soft read at all.  And that's what would happen.  Yeah.  The guy would be like, yeah.  Yeah, a pimp probably would want to fuck your 16-year-old chick.  I mean, I could certainly.  But the Slim character reminds me, and again, I'm just starting it, of Iceberg.  Not Iceberg Slim, but who was the bald pimp in Iceberg Slim's book?  Do you remember that?  I don't.  He's a real character in the 40s.  But he's reminding me of that vibe. 
[03:47:00]  I didn't read many Donald Goins.  I didn't read a lot of those.  Yeah, it was a real character.  He's dead now, but he was just a fucking hardcore pimp.  And this guy reminds me of him, so I kind of like him, and I probably shouldn't.  Yeah, Slim ain't necessarily a pimp.  I don't think pimpin' is in his repertoire.  Oh, he's not?  No, he's not a pimp.  He's a, let's see here, I guess the neighborhood entrepreneurial, just the guy who's the godfather of that area of Atlanta. 
[03:47:30]  But he dibs and dabs in a little bit.  A little bit of everything.  Yeah, because he has diamond earrings, and he's wearing silk and a wig.  Legal and illegal.  Legal and illegal.  You know, he dibs and dabs in a little bit of everything.  Where does this come from with you?  Just pull it out of your mind?  It's drawn from my experiences.  It's also, I've also drawn from the experiences I have witnessed and observed others around me go through. 
[03:48:00]  And I was, you know, I was blessed with the opportunity and afforded the opportunity of working alongside David Ritz, who's done, you know, several biographies.  And he's just an incredibly accomplished writer.  And, you know, as we sat down, you know, he said to me that he wanted to write a book in a world that I was all too familiar with, and he wasn't so familiar with. 
[03:48:30]  And so I said, all right, cool, let's, you know, and we started, we began picking each other's brains and tossing around ideas immediately.  And before you know it, we had, you know, pages.  And we just began to critique those pages and build and build and expand.  And, you know, and this is the result of that. 
[03:49:00]  Do you still pick it up?  And there's something really cool about having, because you obviously have so many products out, but having a box of books that you've written, it's like there really is a cool thing about that.  It makes you feel smart, don't it?  But it's a cool thing, especially since you're, it's risky because you've made your living really, really well doing music.  And it's like you're opening yourself up to be criticized if it's not good.  So it's a huge risk that a lot of guys wouldn't take. 
[03:49:30]  Like, I mean, well, you know, my thing was I wanted to, I wanted to throw people off a little bit, you know, because I know that writing a book about your life, if you have an interesting life, you have an interesting book, you know what I'm saying?  So you don't get as much credit for that.  You know, it's like, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, I knew that.  I knew that already about him, you know.  So I wanted people to actually read this and draw the conclusion of, oh, so he actually invested some time, some effort, some energy, and some artistry into this book. 
[03:50:00]  And I wasn't expecting a novel, you know, so he's actually invested in this part of his career.  And also, I wanted people, I wanted to motivate people in my culture, people of my culture, of my background, in my neighborhoods, to read more.  You know, so I wanted to appeal to their interests as well as their intellect. 
[03:50:30]  Oh, okay.  Now, if you weren't doing music, what do you think you'd be?  Do you think you'd be in trouble, or were you headed on kind of a decent road?  Well, you know, nah, I mean, at that point in time, I was in trouble, but I was trying to find a way out of trouble.  So, I could, it depends, man.  It depends, just like, you know, just like power.  I think it would have depended a lot upon who I had cultivating my talents and abilities, who I had, you know, leading me to or fro.  So, I think that has a lot to do with where people end up in life. 
[03:51:00]  When they are at that pivotal age, 16, 17, 15, 16, 17, who they have around them and what they are being motivated to do.  I think that would have had a huge determination of where I ended up.  Are you still friends with people that are, you know, still, you know, kicking around and doing nasty shit?  I mean, you know, I still know them.  I still know them.  I mean, I'm not, we're not around each other enough in order to say, you know what I'm saying, that we're friends still. 
[03:51:30]  Right.  But I know them, you know, we have a mutual respect for one another.  So, are you glad you're out of that?  Absolutely.  Yeah.  I mean, for what?  I would assume some people would kind of miss the excitement or thrill of it.  You know what?  Too much risk, not enough money.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know what?  You can make so much more money doing far less dangerous things.  You know what I'm saying?  You're not risking your life. 
[03:52:00]  You're not risking your freedom.  You know what I'm saying?  And it's just risk versus reward in anything in life.  Yeah.  The risk is too high and the reward is too low.  Do you find that people, Eminem has a song, I think it was D12 called How Come, and it's  kind of about people in the old neighborhood who are kind of resentful of your success.  Do you find that certain people that you've known kind of expected you to bring them up  with you or resent where you are now?  Well, I mean, it could be, but most of the people who are around me now are people who 
[03:52:30]  were, you know, who come from that part of my life.  Most of the people who I work with now have been around me for 10 years or more.  So they already know who I am as a person.  The people who you say could feel like that, they weren't ever really around me before.  Right.  You know, or they're not applying themselves enough.  You know, you're not really, you're not helping me to help you.  You got to do something worth, you know, worth, worth, worth selling. 
[03:53:00]  Anything is supply and demand.  If you haven't, if there's no demand created, there's nothing for me to supply.  Do you think characters like this too, and I really am annoyed that I didn't read more  of it because the way it's kind of portrayed realistically or harshly almost, it seems like  in movies, they're always trying to find the positive note.  They're not always, they seem like they don't want to paint things honestly.  Yeah.  Which I think it really is, it's uncomfortable to watch and it's kind of sugarcoated. 
[03:53:30]  And this doesn't seem sugarcoated at all.  Well, that's, I mean, that's definitely, authenticity is definitely, that's the approach we wanted to take.  You know, we wanted to remain true and honest to the, the life and the world that we, that  we surrounded this book in.  And, you know, and we have to, we have to remain true to what we, what we writing about.  Or else we just, you know, wasting a lot of people's time and money. 
[03:54:00]  Who would you say coming up was your favorite performer?  Tupac.  Really?  Yeah.  So if you could, if you, is there any music you listen to that people wouldn't expect you  to listen to, like, and we all have that, like, like, do you like country or do you  like, you know, I mean, that might be a stretch, but you know.  I like Maroon 5.  Do you?  Yeah.  Well, that's got some soul to it.  Does it?  I've never listened to them.  It's, it's, uh, yeah, yeah.  It's almost got to sound like, um, God, what's his name?  I like Adele too.  Yeah.  Oh yeah. 
[03:54:30]  That Adele is.  She's great.  But this is how shallow I am.  She's not, I'm not attracted to her, so I can't really listen to her.  I know, I know.  It's very shallow.  It's shitty.  Well, when you see what she looks like.  It kind of bummed us all out.  You know, you have that fantasy of what you think she looks like with a voice like that.  I'm sorry, but it's true.  LaRue, LaRue, I like her as well.  I like a lot of, I mean, I like music, man.  I like music.  You like rock as well?  I do, but you know what?  I haven't really listened to a lot of rock since, since, honestly, Nirvana. 
[03:55:00]  I liked, uh, I like Green Day, obviously.  Why do you say obviously?  Because dude came from Nirvana.  Oh, you know what?  You know more about rock than I know.  I had no idea.  No, you mean the Foo Fighters?  Oh, Foo Fighters.  Oh, Foo Fighters, okay.  Foo Fighters.  Even if you had said Foo Fighters, I wouldn't have connected that.  Let's talk about Dave Grohl.  Okay.  Foo Fighters, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Dude came from Nirvana.  Yeah.  Green Day, uh, I like them a little bit because they remind me of that type of hardcore, grungy, 
[03:55:30]  grungy, you know.  I like the rockers who can sing, though.  You know what I'm saying?  Not the ones who just yell and yell.  And make noise.  Yeah.  Like, who's the actual leader of this band here?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Everybody can scream.  The drummer can scream.  Good.  I hope a guy on our staff is hearing that because he screams a lot in his fucking death metal  band.  So I hope he's hearing that.  T.I. is telling you you're a flop, stupid.  I hope you're hearing that.  I don't do that, man.  I don't do that. 
[03:56:00]  And, uh, so, like, you know, I mean, you're out now and it's like, I'm sure you want to  stay out.  And, like, do you kind of live and learn as these, like, little things happen?  Like, these little traps that people can fall into?  Absolutely.  I mean, you know, I feel like things happen to different people for different reasons.  And everybody in life has a different lesson to learn.  And it takes different encounters and experiences in life to teach those lessons.  So, you know, what it may take for you to learn your lesson isn't exactly what it would 
[03:56:30]  take for me and vice versa.  So I'm just traveling my path and learning my lessons.  Do people try you in jail or how do they treat you?  Because sometimes with celebrities, it can be either way.  They can either respect you and enjoy you or they can...  I mean, I had mutual respect from all the people that mattered.  So nobody...  No real problems.  I'm always fascinated with jail.  We had...  Bernard Hopkins told some great stories about the inventors.  You would last two seconds in it.  That's exactly why.  Why do you think I pay my taxes?  Because I like the government?  No, I don't even fuck in the ass.  Yeah, look at us. 
[03:57:00]  We'd be a problem in jail.  Of course.  Oh, they would love me.  Oh, we would suck in jail.  I wouldn't even get hit.  They'd probably just pinch my cheeks.  Oh, man.  What was the most creative...  I'm always amazed with guys in jail.  The creativity they...  Hopkins stories were amazing.  Yeah, how they made microwaves and...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Now, that kind of stuff, man.  Just that ingenuity that...  Yeah, they definitely...  Was there something like that?  ...are resourceful.  Was there something like that where you were just amazed by?  Like, wow, how did they figure out how to do that?  Yeah, man, you know, they take... 
[03:57:30]  They fry chicken.  How did that make you do?  Yeah, they fry chicken and burritos and stuff by taking...  They get, like, a plastic container, which would be...  They'll cut...  They get a brand-new trash can, a little garbage, little trash thing.  And they'll cut it in half, take the bottom half, fill it with grease,  and they'll get what you call a stinger.  Well, you get a positive and a negative wire.  You put it in the grease and plug it up, and it heats it up, and it fries. 
[03:58:00]  Holy shit!  They make chicken nuggets and french fries.  Is it good?  Did he try it?  Yeah, I mean, it was...  It was all right?  Yeah, better than cafeteria food.  Holy shit, that's amazing.  I mean, there is such a genius to some of the guys in jail.  Don't get it, man.  To make wine in the toilet, I mean...  Oh, yeah, that's another thing, the wine...  No, not in the toilet.  Don't think...  I'm watching The Longest Yard.  So don't they just kind of put it in a bag and just soak it there to keep it cool, or to hit it, or no? 
[03:58:30]  No, you got to keep it warm.  You got to keep it warm.  You just have to have a place to hide.  And yeah, you definitely...  They make it out of tomato paste and sugar and, you know, other things.  Anything that'll ferment after a while.  Anything that will ferment.  There you go.  Yeah.  What was the worst part about being locked up?  Was it the lack of female companionship or the food?  Being locked up.  Yeah.  It was the worst part about being locked up.  It was being locked up.  Did you think, like, right when that happened, did you just think, oh, man, I might have fucked up here?  No, there was no might into it. 
[03:59:00]  Yeah, no might.  But, I mean, did you think, like, that...  Did you ever have any doubt that you'd be able to take up where you left off or anything?  Yeah, man, you know what, man, professionally, I just never, I never really, I don't think  that it, I never thought it would be a problem for me professionally because what I have to  offer the marketplace, I don't think anyone else has, you know, they can't fill that void. 
[03:59:30]  They're not me.  You know what I'm saying?  They can do what they do very well, but they can't do what I do.  So, as long as I continue to do what I do, then there'll be a place for me.  That's one thing you could still do for him, Jay.  It's not like, you know, if you're an auto mechanic and you get sent up to, you know,  somebody could bring their car by and you could still fix it and make a few bucks.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Right, Jay?  Yeah.  You know what I'm saying there, Jay?  No, but you know what?  It's true because the question is, do you ever run out of thoughts or ideas?  Like, as a, you know, do you get, like, can I get writer's block? 
[04:00:00]  If I sit down and say, I have to write, I have to create, I'm fucking finished.  Like, it will happen at a really bad time.  Like, if I'm playing chess on my iPad on the toilet, I'm like, oh, idea.  It always comes where I'm not looking for it.  And what's coming out of your ass is probably a better one.  It really is.  Oh, man.  Can you make yourself create or does it have to just hit you when you're, like,  when you're doing something completely the opposite?  I mean, of course, you want it to happen organically and you want it to be a natural thought. 
[04:00:30]  But, man, you can, if necessary, if you're a professional, I think performing on the spot is a part of the job.  You know, being able to perform at, you know, on command on whatever topic, that's a part of the job.  Do they still do rap battles?  I mean, I'm very 80s with fucking rap.  Oh, my God.  I don't remember.  It's fucking, I'm thinking of, you know, Red Alert and Marley Marle in the fucking late 80s. 
[04:01:00]  You know, every Friday on 106 and Pog.  They do?  Yeah.  Every Friday on 106 and Pog.  Freestyle Fridays.  What an amazing skill that is.  And also an instant humiliation if you're terrible at it.  Instant.  Instant.  Immediate.  Yeah, it just seems like there's no way to bullshit through that with a fucking group watching you.  There's nothing worse than getting your ass handed to you, I think, in a rap battle.  It's going to be quite embarrassing.  You know what's even worse than that?  Doing a good job and doing so good of a job that the guy you're going up against kicks your ass. 
[04:01:30]  Oh, literally kicks your ass.  I've seen some videos where people got, like, pissed off.  Like, fuck, man, this guy's ripping me apart.  And you know the guy getting beat up just wants to go, look, this isn't fair.  I won.  It's not right.  That's really funny.  Is this the thanks I get?  Yeah.  I did a good job.  Show off my skill.  I did this so I wouldn't have to fight.  Is this my pet on the back? 
[04:02:00]  Yeah, that doesn't make sense.  You're right.  Because you do stuff like that so you avoid fighting.  Right.  There's some video on YouTube of a guy doing that where the guys were going back and forth.  But the one guy started getting way too aggressive.  And I guess he was talking too much shit in his lyrics and, like, what he was going to do.  And the other guy just popped him in the face.  Just popped him right in the face.  Yeah, really.  Immediately.  Bow.  Yeah.  I guess the guy knew he had nothing to come back with.  And if you can punch somebody in the face and win, I mean, who wouldn't want to win every argument?  No shit.  That's bullying, Jim.  We don't like bullying, man.  That's not cool.  That wasn't bullying.  The other guy was in his face talking a lot of shit. 
[04:02:30]  I'm just fucking kidding.  Did you ever write anything that you regretted?  Because I know you've had a couple of minor things.  And then you get patched up.  Write anything that I regretted?  Yeah, like, lyrically, once it's out there.  I've done jokes and stuff that I kind of wished I, like, eh.  If I could be.  So did the audience.  Yeah.  I'm fucking with you, Jimmy.  Jimmy's brilliant.  Everything I write is how I feel.  And I mean, I've wrote some things where I say, whoa.  You know, I went kind of far.  That was kind of graphic.  Yeah.  But, you know, it was mostly sexual, of sexual content.  And that's fine. 
[04:03:00]  Yeah.  I mean, well, you know.  What are you going to have to do?  But the thing is, like, you know, I make those songs.  And then, you know what I'm saying, my kids will say, oh, yeah, Dad, I love your album.  Oh, shit.  Wait a minute.  What song do you like?  You know.  So, but I mean, but I'm pretty open, honest.  And I'm a hands-on dad.  So, you know what I'm saying?  Man, I can, I can, I can navigate them through the, the filth.  How old are they?  Through to the art.  How old are the kids? 
[04:03:30]  Man, I have kids from three to 16.  Well, 15.  It should be 16.  So, the younger ones, do you try to just, do you steer away from the hard lyrics?  Or do you, like, just give them the radio edit?  I give it to them.  I give it to them.  I give it to them straight up, uncut.  And I explain to them that, now, if you are confused or have any questions about anything said on this or any other project, you come talk to me about it.  Because if I catch you imitating or repeating any of these things, you're going to have to come deal. 
[04:04:00]  You're going to have to deal with me.  And, you know, we have that understanding.  And I've never had a problem.  You don't want to have a beef with a three-year-old.  No, it's terrible.  Do you think people's perception of what rap is or what rappers are like is accurate?  Or do you think that the media takes certain aspects of the music or the problems that flare up and makes that the entire genre?  Yeah, that's what I think.  I think they take isolated incidents and try to blanket it over the whole genre of music. 
[04:04:30]  But I think that rappers are just like anyone else, just like any other group of performers or group of professionals.  You're going to have good guys.  You're going to have bad apples.  You're going to have good ones who, as far as, you know, they're good at what they do artistically.  And you're going to have ones that suck.  And you're going to have some of integrity.  And you're going to have some that will sell their mother's heirloom, family heirloom, for a record sale, a record deal. 
[04:05:00]  You know, you're going to have different walks of life in anything, in any area you step into.  Rap is no different.  We are all not criminals.  We're all not gangbangers.  We're all not former drug dealers.  We don't all go to jail.  We don't all even, you know, come from urban areas in society. 
[04:05:30]  So we shouldn't all be treated the same and grouped into the same bunch.  It does seem, though, that a lot of people, in order to, I don't know, get the credibility, try to present that, though.  You know what I mean?  Like some guys, if you're from the suburbs around a big city, you're going to say you're from that city to kind of...  It's not really like that anymore, you know, because, you know, look at, you know, two of the biggest stars in the game right now are totally away from that, which is Kanye West and Drake. 
[04:06:00]  You know, both of them are, you know, hey, this is who I am.  This is what I do.  This is my life.  This is not my life.  I'm not going to pretend that this is what I did or what I do.  And, I mean, they're accepted.  They're respected.  Their music is appreciated.  And I think that, you know, other people who come from that walk of life should take their, you know, they should take their lead on that because there's nothing worse than trying to pretend to be something that you're not. 
[04:06:30]  Were you as shocked as I was when it turned out Vanilla Ice was from the suburbs?  I couldn't believe it.  He seemed so street and urban and tough, and then all of a sudden he's fucking coming from the suburbs.  I'm like, you just wrecked my image.  You know, that killed me, too.  Do you know what I noticed, too, a lot of rappers?  Like, and this is one thing I, and again, I'm not as up on rap as I used to be, but, like, Eminem talks about being afraid a lot. 
[04:07:00]  And it's like, I always kind of wanted rappers to address that more.  Afraid?  Like, he talks about being just what it is that scares him or hurts him beyond, and again, there might be a lot of guys doing it that I just missed.  I've never heard him talking about being afraid.  I've heard about him talking about being hurt or being upset and, you know, just unhappy.  I guess I'm thinking of something, maybe it was from 8 Mile, where the lyric is something, I'm afraid, so why am I afraid?  It's about, I think, where he's trying to write or create something. 
[04:07:30]  Okay.  And I'm just like, I kind of like the fact that he addressed that part of the psyche that I don't hear a lot of rappers addressing.  Are they just trying to be hard all the time?  Yeah, because I'm sure it exists, and maybe there are guys that do it, and I just don't know it.  You're talking about showing vulnerability, Jimmy?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Absolutely.  Yeah, I mean, well, you know, I think that that honesty, that true-to-life honesty is what people can connect to in music, in rappers.  Not only just rappers, I guess music of all genres. 
[04:08:00]  But that honesty is what, you know, the listener identifies with, and that's what brings them back and connects them with you and brings them back on your next project and your next project, because they feel like they relate to you and what you're going through.  Your pain is their pain.  There's a weird thing, too, when you meet people, because you tell them things, you know, for us it's here or whatever, and for you it's your music, and they really know a lot more about you than you know about them.  Right.  And that's always an odd feeling, because they expect you to be forthcoming, and it's like, but you know 50 things about me, and I know one thing about you. 
[04:08:30]  All I'm asking for is a picture of your pussy, because you at least just text me a picture of your vagina, so we're on even ground.  Oh, man.  Hey, man, you know what?  I never thought about that.  I never thought about that.  That's a classy approach.  I just put P, you know, I don't actually write the word out of course.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, okay, yeah.  P and P-U and two fives.  Like P-U dollar sign, dollar sign.  You figure out the rats. 
[04:09:00]  You got to be classy, yeah.  I always find that it's an odd feeling with people to know that they know so much more about me than I know about them.  And do you ever regret putting personal things out there, and just kind of want to like wall up a little bit and be private?  I mean, I don't know if I can say I regret it.  You know, I've definitely examined the challenge that it brought.  So, you know, I examined the result of it. 
[04:09:30]  I don't say I regret it, though.  I think that everything, all things about me have, they've contributed to making me who I am as an artist, as a man, you know.  So, I think that at the end of the day, you just got to accept it.  You got to accept it and see how you can make it better and move forward.  How do you deal with the fame?  You just sometimes want to fucking just be alone.  You know, now, I would much rather have some quiet money. 
[04:10:00]  Yeah, quiet money.  You got that loud money.  I'd rather have some quiet money.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I got loud money.  You know, I see a lot of people, man, with far, far, we were just talking about this last night.  I see, you know, there are a lot more people with far, far, far more money than me.  And they just, you know, they just go and live.  Like, whoever owns this thing, whoever owns Sirius,  he can go ride the subway, he can, you know, he can go shopping.  Yeah, that's quiet money.  He's not paying his talent. 
[04:10:30]  Keep a little too much for himself.  You know what I'm saying?  And just like, you know, like the guy, you know, Edgar Brofman, one of the owners of Warner.  I know he is.  You don't know Edgar Brofman?  No, no.  Well, the Warner Music Group.  Okay.  All right, well, one of.  He can walk around, man, just like you said, you don't know who he is.  You know, this guy's loaded.  This guy has more money than the color blue. 
[04:11:00]  You know, this guy's loaded.  A lot of money.  And, you know what I'm saying?  He can walk around, do whatever.  And people, you know, they'll never bother him.  They'll never know to bother him.  Yeah, he's just another suit walking around.  Just another suit.  Can you do anything without being recognized anymore?  Like, is there any.  I wonder with guys who have that level of fame.  Like, what's the last thing you can remember doing?  Just like maybe with your girl going to a movie where nobody bothered you.  Nobody knew who you were. 
[04:11:30]  Nah, well, you know, well, in my line of work, you kind of you want people to know who you are.  You know what I'm saying?  That kind of yields to your.  That yields a good performance.  But I just learned how to handle it.  I learned how to handle it.  I learned how to deal with it.  If you manage the situation, then you can, you know what I'm saying?  You can get through the day.  Now, Pete, when you go to.  I'll give you an example. 
[04:12:00]  Let's say you go to a crowded area.  Let's say it's a mall.  Okay.  You go to the mall.  A lot of people start to gather.  Crowd gathers.  Everyone notices you.  Now, if you just take off running through the mall, then they're going to chase you.  Right.  However, if you say, hey, how y'all doing?  How y'all doing?  Excuse me.  Hey, listen, guys.  I'm just here.  I got to run and get something right quick.  I appreciate the love.  If y'all just let me shout.  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And you just, you know, make your way through there. 
[04:12:30]  Then, you know, you treat them like people that treat you like a person and they'll shake your  hand, say what they want to say to you.  And they'll move on.  What's worse than when you're having an argument in a text or on the phone with your girl  and some fuck?  And I'm always fan friendly.  Oh, no.  But it is literally the worst.  Like some people have no perception at all.  And I like getting photos of people.  I'm a bit of an asshole.  I love taking pictures with people.  But, you know, it's like, will you fucking, will you read the room?  Can you not see how unhappy I am right now?  I'm reading the room.  When you're eating? 
[04:13:00]  Dude, even I won't ask when people are eating.  But I've actually had people at the Comedy Cellar sit down next to me.  Yeah.  And go, do you mind if I take a picture?  It's like, look at me.  Yeah.  You know, that's like, you know, those are things that I won't do.  I won't do it while I'm eating with my family.  And I don't like doing it, like, in public, public places.  Because one starts in the morning.  Like airports and malls.  I don't like doing them in there.  Because, you know, like you say, you do one and you're doing them until you leave. 
[04:13:30]  Listen to this, Jimmy.  But what's worse than a chick with a cell phone trying to take a picture?  The boyfriend gives her the camera.  You know the worst thing is when they ask you to take a picture, you say okay,  then they don't know how to work it.  Yeah, it's not set up.  Oh, man.  Wait a minute.  It didn't take.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  How do you do this?  Oh, man.  The battery's going dead.  One more.  One more.  Wait.  Let me see your phone.  Let me see your phone.  All of a sudden, it's a photo shoot.  Oh, wait.  I'm doing video.  A flash.  It's like a fucking camera.  Can you figure that out at home? 
[04:14:00]  I've never used it before.  I need a flash.  Turn away from the light.  Turn away.  There's nothing worse than a girlfriend fumbling with an iPhone.  Setting up reflectors.  We have to wrap him.  But just to plug, the book is called Power and Beauty, A Story of Life on the Streets.  And I'm telling you genuinely, I have read a small amount of it, but I really liked what  I read.  It's very ballsy.  And you're going to continue reading it even after T.I. Lee.  A lot of times, I don't finish the books.  I really will.  No, he is.  I asked him off mic.  Yeah.  Jimmy reads a lot.  Yeah, but it's usually just biographies. 
[04:14:30]  And I don't like nonfiction as much anymore.  And this one grabbed me immediately.  And it was just late.  That's what's up.  I was being a pig online again.  And you say you need to know that.  You read a lot of nonfiction?  Only, well, crime stuff.  And also, just when we're interviewing people.  Sure.  I'll read the books of people who are coming in to be interviewed.  I feel obligated to.  That's rather distinguished of you.  Yeah.  But you don't understand.  I'm such a sex addict.  Anytime I'm not reading, I'm being a creep on the computer.  So I literally will read, look at porn, stop, read, Twitter, play chess on the iPad. 
[04:15:00]  It's only 20 pages.  And you know what, man?  You're exercising a lot of parts of the brain right now.  You're stimulating a lot of different parts of your brain.  I really am.  I'm holding the book with my left hand.  I put it down and jerk it off with the right hand.  All right, here we go.  He doesn't need to know that.  He doesn't care.  You want him to come back.  You and Diddy are all right now?  Yeah, man.  We always have been, man.  There's a little weird thing that happened last week.  Man, that's my brother, man.  I guess what the world witnessed was two brothers who have an equal amount of admiration and respect for one another. 
[04:15:30]  Diddy was serving some vodka.  Someone was drinking something different.  Oh, yeah.  I heard that.  Diddy did not like that at first.  And then T.I. stepped in.  Yeah.  So relaxed and controlled the situation immediately.  Well, you know, that's my brother, man.  You know what I'm saying?  He's one of the first people who actually, of his level of success, who actually reached back and said,  Hey, man, I think you got what it takes.  So, you know, I'm always going to have a huge amount of respect and admiration for Puff. 
[04:16:00]  Win it, win it, win it, boo.  That's it for the worst of Opeed Anthony. </pre>
