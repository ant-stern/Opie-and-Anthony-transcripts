<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a darkly humorous discussion about a South Carolina funeral home employee who amputated a corpse's legs to fit it in a casket. This sparked crude jokes and hypothetical scenarios from the hosts and callers, including a particularly nonsensical and offensive contribution from Andy from Cleveland.  The conversation then veered wildly, transitioning to sexually explicit jokes about Lawrence Taylor, a Twitter game involving refusing blowjobs, and graphic jokes related to Opie's recent experience with the birth of his nine-pound baby.  This led to a discussion of the challenges and anxieties of fatherhood, interwoven with further vulgar and sexually explicit comments.  The hosts also discussed the homoerotic imagery on men's underwear packaging and Abercrombie & Fitch models, before returning to the topic of Opie's baby, vaccinations, and parenting challenges, punctuated by more offensive commentary and a promotion for a "cherry darts" event involving whipped cream and cherry-throwing at buttocks.

The show continued with a heavy focus on Jim Norton's new iPhone app, featuring sexually explicit sound effects, and its humorous, often insulting, iTunes reviews.  Extensive discussion ensued regarding the logistical nightmares, including legal requirements and age restrictions, involved in organizing their "cherry darts" contest. A heated argument erupted between the hosts and their engineer, Mars, over missing headphones, followed by a discussion of the UFC, specifically Dana White's dismissal of Paul Daley and Kimbo Slice, incorporating audio from a White press conference.  The hosts also reviewed various movies (*Furry Vengeance*, *Iron Man 2*, *Avatar*) and the TV show *West Side Story*,  which led to discussions about different types of pornography ("beard porn," "foot porn"), incorporating clips from Ron and Fez's show, and further sexually explicit conversations. Comedian Al Jackson appeared as a guest towards the end of this segment.

A subsequent segment started with a discussion about a caller's son with Asperger's syndrome, his stand-up comedy success, and the challenges of helping him navigate social situations. The conversation shifted to graphic descriptions of the movie *Precious*,  explicit commentary on the physical appearance of its actress, Monique, and other actresses, and a lengthy, offensive discussion of racial preferences regarding women.  Personal anecdotes, including stories about cats urinating and destroying property, a dog attacking its leg, childhood memories, and sexual experiences were also shared.  A story about a radio host's encounter with Keith Hernandez and Sarah Palin was recounted, alongside a self-deprecating anecdote about a mistaken interview. Al Jackson and Andy Levy (from Red Eye) were in-studio guests, with Bill Schulz (also from Red Eye) joining later. Listener calls to the "F.U. line" featured vulgar messages, and a song about a detachable penis was briefly mentioned.  Highly offensive language and sexually explicit and racially charged comments were frequent throughout this segment.

The final segment began with a discussion about television reception and bandwidth issues, followed by a vulgar description of Dana White's alleged drunkenness.  The conversation then shifted back to the UFC, specifically its storylines and fighters, particularly Jamie Yeager.  This led to a phone conversation with Dana White, discussing the firings of Kimbo Slice and Paul Daley, and the reasons behind these decisions.  A caller from WhatWouldTylerDurdenDo.com questioned a fighter faking injuries. The show then briefly covered Lady Gaga's music videos (in explicit terms), Justin Bieber's interview, and an anecdote about an awkward interview question. The segment concluded with promotion of Jim Norton's app, upcoming events (including Norton's stand-up and Red Eye appearances), and the next UFC event, along with a final mention of the "cherry darts" contest, emphasizing gender balance.  Besides the hosts and board operator, no other guests were in-studio for this segment. Sam Roberts, a Sirius XM personality, was present in the studio during an earlier segment and participated in the discussions surrounding Opie’s absence due to his child’s birth and shared personal anecdotes about his girlfriend’s child birth.  A SiriusXM commercial for the Opie and Anthony intern program was also aired.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This South Carolina funeral home has been forced to shut down after its director admitted  one of his employees cut the legs of a corpse without the family's permission.  He was a man that was full of love.  James Hines was a minister who died of skin cancer in 2004.  This funeral home handled the burial for Hines' 6'7 frame.  According to the measurement on the casket and the funeral director, 
[00:00:30]  we asked him, is this suitable for his length?  And he said, yeah, that would be perfect.  The home's director said employees never told Hines' family that his body might not fit in a standard casket.  But when rumors started to spread, authorities opened an investigation and exhumed his body last April  and found that Hines' legs had been cut to fit.  Oh, man.  I have a feeling this happens a lot.  I bet it does.  They just don't tell the families.  Also, the shoes just look too close to the knees and they don't want to say it? 
[00:01:00]  Like, why are the shoes so close to the knees?  They're kind of crooked.  I think what they should have done is knocked two holes in the bottom of the coffin  and stuck his legs out.  Like he's a fucking SpongeBob SquarePants?  Yes.  And just stick his feet out the bottom.  SpongeBob SquareCadaver.  As the pallbearers are carrying it, you just see his feet dragging on the ground.  Big fucking lanky douche.  It'd be like a basketball player sleeping on a kid's bed with his feet hanging off. 
[00:01:30]  Let's go to Andy from Cleveland.  Andy.  You ever notice when a body's buried, you cut the feet off, and a religious family gets  mad at you?  You ever notice how a body smells when you put your fingers in his hiney after he's been  rotting in the sun or the woods for a week?  You ever notice that I belong in a coffin even more than that body does, and yet I'm still  talking?  You ever notice?  All right, already.  We know.  We don't notice anything. 
[00:02:00]  I haven't.  I'm too busy fucking girls.  Thank God you're there to notice everything, because I haven't noticed nothing in my life.  Jesus.  What the fuck?  You ever notice that Ed Bradley's family didn't say anything when we did the same thing to  him?  Cut his ear off and put his earring on the lid.  You ever notice?  I'm Andy Rooney.  You ever notice?  You've never seen me walking?  My asshole has actually been stuck to this seat since 1973.  You ever notice that? 
[00:02:30]  I like watches.  I talk a lot about watches.  When the big hand's on the 12, I've just shit my pants.  And when the big hand's on the 4, I've just pissed on myself and grabbed my wife's breast.  Then I realize it's her knee.  You ever notice when someone turns around and bent like Oscar Madison?  You put your penis in the wrong hole?  You ever notice that?  Enough with your stupid observations.  He's the worst. 
[00:03:00]  Why do they call it a satin pillow?  Shouldn't it be a lying pillow?  Because that's what you do in a coffin.  You don't sit in a coffin.  Unless you're me.  And you've been doing it for 25 years.  Oh, shit.  Kung Fu.  What the fuck was that?  It's my new sneeze.  It just exploded.  You ever wonder why they call it a coffin and not a sneezing?  I don't think much coffin's really going on in there after they shut the lid. 
[00:03:30]  You'd think they'd call it a rotten, because that's what you're doing.  The O.B. Anthony Show starts now.  Previously on O&A.  Let's say hi to Ralph in Jersey.  Ralph.  There's insurmountable evidence against L.T.  Apparently they found both his Super Bowl rings on the nightstand.  I mean, and they weren't on the nightstand. 
[00:04:00]  Fucking boom.  He's trying to recover.  Let's listen.  Oh, he hung up.  Oh, yuck.  He didn't hang up.  That's what happens to your phone when you crash at 1,000 miles an hour.  Hopefully his phone blew up like the Israelis did to that.  Sometimes I think my girl just fucks too many guys.  I'm going to leave.  I don't think anyone will miss me.  Are we trying to get her on the line right now?  Yeah.  Maybe one of the guys she's on me with will fuck me. 
[00:04:30]  Kind of like a bonus.  The faggot was here.  It's written on his back.  Would it bother you if a guy licked his own semen off your breasts?  Um, no.  Usually Sean does a taste test for me, so.  All right.  Sean, is that true?  Could you elaborate on that a little bit?  I'd just like dip your tongue in it.  No, you don't.  So, so, you've ejaculated on her, and then you've put your tongue in, and you're ejaculated. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  Why?  What's wrong with that?  I don't know.  It's awful.  Nah, it is.  I agree with both of you.  It is awful, but I also respect the fact he's a trooper.  Not afraid to get his uniform dirty.  The gang on Twitter started a new game.  I wouldn't turn down a BJ, and this one just came in from Wet Oreo.  I wouldn't turn down a BJ, even if it meant missing my mother's funeral. 
[00:05:30]  Yes.  Wow.  That turning down a BJ thing is going to stay with a lot of people today.  Turn one down at my mother's funeral.  Exactly.  I wouldn't turn one down from my mother at her funeral.  Opie and Anthony, live next.  Opie and Anthony, live next. 
[00:06:00]  Opie and Anthony, live next. 
[00:06:30]  Opie and Anthony, live next. 
[00:07:00]  Opie and Anthony, live next. 
[00:07:30]  Opie and Anthony, live next. 
[00:08:00]  Opie and Anthony, live next. 
[00:08:30]  Opie and Anthony, live next.  Opie and Anthony, live next.  Opie and Anthony, live next.  Opie and Anthony, live next.  We'll be right back. 
[00:09:00]  Freedom of fucking speech, like we've said many times, the freedom to say some awful things. 
[00:09:30]  You might not like it, but we have the right to say them.  Oh, my.  We have low self-esteem as a show.  They are not doing anything.  They're not highly skilled.  They have no talent.  We're just exploiting people.  See, kids, smoke your pot, play your video games, and watch TV.  You'll be better off when you get our age.  There's no ratings here.  No one cares.  Enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Show's on the road. 
[00:10:00]  I'll say it is.  Yes.  Hi.  Hope you're an Anthony program.  Wonderful.  Monday.  It's cold up in this pitch.  Yeah.  I walk down.  I go, I see my doorman.  I go, what is it, winter again?  He goes, ah.  You like talking the weather with your doorman?  I really do.  Yeah.  It's interesting stuff.  Then I threw dollars in the air, and I said, now fetch. 
[00:10:30]  And he did.  Yes.  He's a doorman.  Yeah.  I'm sick.  The wind was crazy.  Tried to go out for a little Mother's Day dinner with mom and the family.  And it's just like a monsoon winds going on.  But then we went into a sushi place.  And, um, god damn.  I don't know.  Parents reach an age, and it just starts getting like. 
[00:11:00]  Oh, no.  Oh.  Well, you know, I remember the old days.  Mom and Sal out on the boat, just tearing shit up, you know?  And now you go to dinner with him, and it's first.  I mean, I swear I had just sat down, and Sal just starts talking about one of his friends  who's got medical problems.  And I was like, I said to him, I looked at my watch, I go, Sal, can we wait five minutes  before the medical talk, you know?  And then my mother goes, what medical talk? 
[00:11:30]  Are you okay?  Like, no, I was just talking about Sal saying the medical talk.  Forget it.  Can I have some sake?  I thought you didn't eat sushi.  No, I eat, uh, like cooked sushi.  Oh.  Which, uh, sounds like an oxymoron.  But I like the, uh, the, uh, crab.  The kanikama.  Whatever it's called.  Uh, the crab leg.  The king crab leg.  Yeah.  On a little thing of rice.  And then, and then the shrimp.  Cooked shrimp.  And then I'll eat, uh, and the Jimmy farts.  Yeah.  And, uh, and I'll eat, like, the, uh, smoked fucking eel thingy. 
[00:12:00]  That was great.  The unagi.  It's a little, it's a little, as they say, um, in the Italian community, a little, uh,  mushad.  A mushad.  Yeah, the texture's a little, like, bleh bleh bleh bleh.  Yeah.  And there's teeny, teeny, thin, thin bones in it occasionally.  No, there isn't.  You chew them, you sometimes, once in a while, I don't know if it's a bone or a piece of cartilage,  but.  What are you, blowing it?  His little bone.  Oh, you didn't know eels had hands, but sometimes I feel them on my ears holding me. 
[00:12:30]  I didn't, I never noticed the bone.  Or it's a something in eel sushi, yeah.  Little teeny, teeny something.  Maybe it's not.  They don't take everything out that they should.  No.  Some sushi's like, you look at stuff and, oh, you're supposed to eat that.  And the whole thing where you just gotta grab the entire piece and shove it in your mouth.  Yeah.  It's too much food in your mouth.  I love that.  I gag.  I have a bad gag reflex.  I'd be terrible.  I'd bring a knife and fork and eat sushi.  Do you?  Yeah.  Sit there slicing it.  Do you know what a douchebag you'd look like?  Cutting fucking sushi. 
[00:13:00]  You would.  Be thrown out of the joint.  And a lot of people there, you know.  And, of course, the little nephew and niece there.  And they're fine for the first hour.  And then they start getting a little fidgety, as they say, fidgety, and crying at things.  And, you know, and then I start looking around, even though they're not my kids, but I start  looking around going, like, oh, who's pissed?  Because I'd be the guy going, shut those fucking kids up. 
[00:13:30]  And I'm sitting at the table with the kids.  So you're a little embarrassed.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm getting the look, like, from other tables.  And I'm just putting my head down, like, what's that kid crying about?  I have no idea.  Meanwhile, I was that kid when I was a kid.  But, sushi, I don't know.  It scares me.  Baby.  Just an infant.  Terrible.  And speaking of babies.  You should have seen the guests at my house over the weekend.  I'm teasing, of course. 
[00:14:00]  I'm not fucking children.  Opie, congratulations to Greg Opie Hughes and his lovely wife, Lindsay.  A Mother's Day child.  Yep.  How about that?  Had a baby yesterday.  Nine pounds, four ounces.  That's big.  That's a big baby.  Wow.  That's a big baby.  And then Kenny told me the dimensions also of how, you know, long it was or something.  He's a big kid.  I don't listen to Kenny.  Well, the kid's been there long enough.  I mean, it was like six months late.  The kid's probably two already. 
[00:14:30]  It was a gestation period of an elephant.  Jesus.  And, yeah, well, apparently it came out last night.  Stop saying apparently.  Thank you.  I have to remind myself apparently every day that apparently I shouldn't say apparently.  Apparently.  It's okay to say it sometimes.  No, it's a crutch.  It's a crutch.  I hate it.  And now when I use it in my regular life, I try not to use it.  Apparently.  Yeah, I've been doing crazy with it, too.  I'm like, I got to go see my two apparently's.  Boo.  Why didn't you do that in the Chip voice?  Because that wasn't even funny enough for Chip. 
[00:15:00]  Chip wouldn't even touch that one.  That stunk.  Yes, apparently.  What's so funny about that?  Nothing.  They haven't picked a name for the baby yet.  Yeah, which is odd.  Like, that's something.  But knowing Opie and how he packs ten minutes before we're ready to go to a gig and things like that,  I could see something like a baby not being named.  Well, let's not forget they did wait until the day of the wedding to do their seating chart.  To do the seating chart.  They're both, you know, they kind of put things off a little bit. 
[00:15:30]  So, um, baby X, I guess.  What are we calling the little baby?  Young Gregorio for now.  Yes.  Young Gregorio Hughes.  Look, we saw a picture.  Very healthy baby.  Very cute.  Very cute.  Wow.  And, um, no, that's not the baby.  That's not the baby?  No.  That's a big baby.  Thank God.  Yeah, Sam just pulled up a picture of a giant baby.  There's a giant kid, and I didn't know how to spin this one positively.  Wow, that's a human. 
[00:16:00]  That'll be on Maury.  Wow.  Someone actually had that?  Yeah, it's like a 17-pound baby.  Wow.  So that's more than nine pounds, but.  Yeah, by almost twice.  Oh, my God.  Turn her upside down.  She's a funnel now.  Oof.  That's got to tear some stuff up coming out.  One would think.  17-pound baby?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  The vagina will actually sue the kid in 18 years.  The husband will.  What are you doing to me here? 
[00:16:30]  Exactly.  He's just, fweet-a-le-dee-dee on the side.  Let me find a smooth spot.  Yeah.  Fweet-a-le-dee-dee.  It's like a dinner bell.  Shanga, shanga, shanga.  Yeah, vittles are on, and I think I'm coming.  So up is the father now.  Yeah, father.  He was really, definitely excited about it.  I got some texts from him, and it was the, it was that, you could feel the energy from  his texts that he was very, very excited about it, and Lindsay is also. 
[00:17:00]  So, yeah, so he's taking a paternity leave.  Yes.  To learn what it's like to be a daddy, I guess.  You know, because I guess they could teach you a bunch of shit, but until you're actually  there changing those shitty diapers and waking up at all hours and stuff like that, you don't  know.  And it's like your responsibility, though.  Like, I hate being responsible for anything.  Oh my God, right?  I'm so bad at it.  I'm always afraid. 
[00:17:30]  I'm going to forget to, my fucking plant, I don't know how my plant is hung on it for  this time.  My plant is just used to eating once every four months.  What is the name, Robert or something?  The plant.  Oh yeah, I was singing, stay away to heaven.  I said, what are you doing?  It's just a tree.  Get out of here.  What are you singing?  Yeah, the plant, I go to, I say, it's making toast.  I said, what are you doing, you tree?  But that's scary, man.  It's like, you know, it's like your wife is at least an adult, but like a baby, like 
[00:18:00]  you have to, it does nothing without you.  I've known plenty of people that have had their first baby.  And thank God that's not me, but I have known quite a few.  And yeah, it's one of those situations where you just kind of thrust into it.  It's more, it's more important than anything else.  A car, you know, how about you just, you know, you know, you just, you know, you  jump in a car and then just start driving it around with no knowledge whatsoever of an  automobile.  That's pretty much what it is. 
[00:18:30]  Only it's a human life.  Yeah.  A living little thing that isn't even quite cooked yet.  How do you know when to burp it?  Like it's got, it actually has to vomit on you.  You have to burp a kid.  You have to, or it's going to gas and cry or be unhappy.  Yeah.  So it's almost like, it's mandatory that you have to put that thing over your shoulder  and burp it and it throws up on you.  And then it's always going like, bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh.  Oh, dude.  Yeah.  Dude.  You know what, though?  Nine months, you stay.  Boom.  You're out.  It's a race.  You're out.  Or you rock baby. 
[00:19:00]  That was disgusting.  Yeah.  So, um, I, I don't know.  I, I can't be that responsible.  I've been told by a lot of people.  I've been told by a lot of people, uh, that I should at least have like an animal in my  house, like a cat or a dog.  And, um, no, I don't, I don't like, I like animals.  I like the shook a shook a.  Yeah.  When you get, when you're hanging out at someone else's house and they got animals, a shook 
[00:19:30]  a shook a shook a under their chin.  Yeah.  But, um, first of all, they just kind of wreck things.  Like when you, when you, you reach a point where you're kind of able to have new things.  Like if I still have my couch with the duct tape on the arm because it was ripped.  And then every month I would replace the duct tape to brand new duct tape and be like  proud that now I had clean new duct tape on my couch.  Why?  Because I wish I had the beep there.  Oh.  All right.  Let me see.  Um, yeah.  What do you.  There it is.  Because Anthony, you see, was a many, uh, years ago. 
[00:20:00]  Apparently some people still think I'm a, but I'm not.  How about that?  Every time you say apparently.  Yes.  E-Rock's going to run in here and suck your dick.  I like that.  What a deal.  Yeah.  I, uh, I was very happy about the new duct tape, but now, you know, I got some furniture  in there that I enjoy and I don't want, um, animal hair on it.  Right.  I don't want, uh, them chewing things up. 
[00:20:30]  And then I like the spontaneity of, let's say I wanted just off the top of my head, uh,  July 2nd and 3rd, I wanted to go to the Borgata to see Jimmy Norton.  Ooh.  I can just pick up and go.  I don't have to find a kennel for a dog or set out things.  And then you come home to, uh, uh, uh, uh, cats in the house and they've been alone for  a while.  And then, you know, you kind of, um, I kind of pretends that these are things that he 
[00:21:00]  would need to do.  I, that is the odd part of it.  You can have the cats in wing four of the house, the dogs in a wing five and the servants  handling all of them.  You'd never see shit.  He doesn't buy his own underwear.  I think, I think someone else is going to handle taking care of the cat.  I did buy my own underwear and I made a big mistake and got extra, extra large.  And I was very embarrassed because I, I, I grabbed the box really quickly because it  was that homoerotic picture on it.  And I didn't want to sit there browsing it like some kind of fruit. 
[00:21:30]  So all I did was I walked up and went and just grabbed the box and took it to the register,  you know, turned over.  So you can't really see the, the nude man on it.  And, um, when I got them home, I opened it up and they were giant underwear.  They actually probably thought you were shopping according to which box cover guys you wanted  to fuck.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or, or I'm buying underwear for some, like I'm buying for a big bear that I'm living with.  They sent the twink out for underpants. 
[00:22:00]  Underpants.  But that's the problem with, you know, outgrowing things like fruit of the loom underwear.  Like I like having a little luxury in my, uh, in my drawers as they say.  So I'll get the Calvin Klein's or something.  But every box that they come in has a picture of a flaming homosexual wearing those underwear  with a giant bulge.  And, uh, I don't want to sit there and peruse the rack like I'm, I'm trying to pick out 
[00:22:30]  the, the hot guy.  So I just grabbed it and, uh, and it turned out to be extra, extra large.  Did you bring them back?  No.  Did you have somebody else bring them back?  No, I opened it up.  I just went, I think they're still sitting in my drawer, like just waiting for some fat  gentleman to come over.  You need undies?  As I walk up to him, place them against the front.  Thank you.  I think these will fit you.  Yes.  You want to go swimming?  Yeah.  Yes.  These are my brothers. 
[00:23:00]  This is great iced tea.  I've got to go, Anthony.  I've got to go.  Yes.  I don't care if she stays, lays, or prays.  If it happens on the show, I won't notice it.  Isn't this great producing?  No.  Make my, like, wherever you are, except for producing the show, that's the place to be. 
[00:23:30]  Whenever you're at work, act like that's not the place you are at.  Oh, boy.  Yes.  Oh, God.  Yes.  I never took them back.  And it's just hard shopping for things like that.  They've made everything so homoerotic.  You go into, what's one?  Is it Banana Republic or something?  Abercrombie.  Abercrombie.  And they've got dancing boys.  They've got rent boys dancing around. 
[00:24:00]  And why am I going in there?  And they sell guy clothes.  You don't want to go in there while there's fucking guys with abs just walking around.  Threatening.  And the one in New York here on Fifth Avenue, they had a guy who was a topless Abercrombie model in the front.  So you walk in, and he's just standing there taking pictures with girls.  He's a 10.  And it's just humiliating.  Their pants are pulled right down to their fucking pubis.  They have that V.  It's like you look at those guys.  It's almost like if you walked in with a chick and she said, just go shop ugly while I fuck these two. 
[00:24:30]  You couldn't be mad at her.  Yes.  That's what I mean.  It's kind of like threatening.  You're walking in.  You know how pissed your fucking chick would be?  Virtually strippers in a store.  And you're walking around and, all right, you just shop.  I'm just going to stare at these fucking tits and ass for a while.  The double standard, as they call it.  Yeah, they all got that from the goddamn top of the pelvis down to their dick. 
[00:25:00]  There's an arrow.  Like a giant cock here.  It's follow the arrow to the giant cock.  Although they're probably following each other's arrows to each other's giant cock.  Two arrows, bump heads like fucking rattlesnakes.  The docking procedure.  Just follow the arrows with your cock.  And that's probably the one in New York.  It's a guy with two hot chicks.  That's great.  Two, four, six, eight, ten.  He has a ten pack. 
[00:25:30]  It's a ten pack.  God, I don't have that.  Annoying.  What do you do to get like that?  Christ.  I hear it's all diet.  I think I have a six pack under a beer belly.  It's just covered with the beer belly.  If I chopped it off, I'd have great abs.  Sam's watching me a cupcake.  If I was skinned.  Oh, great.  Yeah, good.  There's four cupcakes there.  Tasking you.  Yeah, skinned.  Exactly.  I could have abs like that if I was on a display in bodies.  Yeah, yeah.  The body display. 
[00:26:00]  Jimmy finally has abs.  As I'm pointing at a horse and death.  They skinned him.  So you think Opie's going to bring the kid in?  It'll probably take a while, though.  I think a while before the kid actually comes in.  Although, you don't know.  Maybe, you know, all bundled up with Lindsay bringing him in.  And Opie just kind of, you know, hey, that's the kid.  They say, Joe said, your brother said you drink the Kool-Aid immediately.  It's like, it's supposed to change the way you look at everything.  Yeah, my brother's just a complete dad. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  Now, it's, I saw him last night for dinner.  And he's got little Layla with him.  And she's just like a clingy monkey.  She just grabs onto him.  And he's like, all right, sit over here.  Or, oh, look, there's Uncle Anthony saying hello.  And she just turns her head.  She doesn't want to even know me.  But their kids are like that.  They're all, and then.  They're honest. 
[00:27:00]  They can sense who hates them.  Exactly.  Not that you don't like your niece.  But she can try and say, he's anti-kid.  Fuck him.  And then there's little Warren, who is my sister Dawn, and Patrick's kid.  And Warren was actually, because Layla started crying at one point, because that's just what kids do.  And then Warren was imitating Layla crying and laughing at her.  He was just going, like, just annoying her and making her cry more.  And I'm getting more embarrassed.  Six weeks before kids can go out. 
[00:27:30]  That's it.  Shots.  I've seen.  They need shots.  Oh, well.  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah.  You're thinking of a puppy.  You're thinking of alcohol.  They get nervous.  They need blackberry brandy.  We need some shots here.  You can't, like, you can bring them over to the in-laws, around, like, a small group of people, but, like, in large.  Why?  They're not vaccinated, and they don't have immunities to, um.  What have people got around here?  We got to worry about fucking syphilis and clap, chlamydia. 
[00:28:00]  Like, basic germs.  The kids haven't built up immunity, so they need to get their vaccinations.  How old is your son?  He is a month old today.  How long before he was born did you name him?  We knew at the baby shower.  They pick out, like, like, parents, a lot of them do pick out the names.  They know the names before the baby's born.  What's on the little bracelet?  Just.  What?  Just Hughes?  Like, what's on that little bracelet in the nursery?  It's BB for baby boy, and then last name.  Wow. 
[00:28:30]  That's it, huh?  Yeah, that's it.  That's all they put.  But even if they know the name?  If you know the name, you start filling out paperwork in the, um, uh, delivery room,  or wherever you're staying.  It's usually they deliver and keep you in the same room for a while.  Do they still take little feety prints?  Yeah.  They take feety prints and handprints, and, uh, but, you know, these days.  I've never used that for criminals.  Like, everyone's done it.  If everyone's, like, nailed the hands and the footprints.  I know, right?  Just use it.  They, uh.  Babies don't steal stuff, though.  Four sets of handprints. 
[00:29:00]  What?  I'm just saying.  That would be an error.  There's two kids, yeah.  Because, yeah, you should take the feet and the handprints.  That's all I'm saying.  Interchangeable.  Um, so your baby is a month, so it's two, uh, two, uh, two more weeks, your kid can come in.  Yes.  Oh, sure he will.  Your child has had the shots?  He's a very cute baby.  He's got, uh, no, he's, uh, the first thing they get, the first thing the kid gets within  the, a couple of days, like, a day or two of being born is the hepatitis B. 
[00:29:30]  And then, uh, they get their first set of several vaccination shots, like, over the  course of, I think it's every, uh, month they get another, another set of shots.  Aren't those nerve-wracking to, to, like, give your kid these chemicals put in their body  like that?  Um, it's, no, because at that point you've heard the fucking kid cry incessantly every  day.  I don't mean about the crying part.  I mean, I mean, you know, they're, yeah, they're just going to go like, and they get the needle  stuck in them.  But, uh, like, ah, you just hear that one in a million story of, uh, some kid getting 
[00:30:00]  vaccinated and all of a sudden they're drooling idiots.  Right.  I don't know.  Get a radio show.  But that just sounds, like, creepy.  No, honestly, it's, it's, at least not for us.  It's all part of the process.  It's, uh, you just, you just, because you've seen so many doctors and the kid has been poked  and prodded so many times, especially when, when my son Xander was born, he had, um, low  blood sugar.  So every hour or two they were poking his foot with a needle and making him scream like bloody 
[00:30:30]  murder.  Why?  So they could take his blood sugar.  Oh.  And so by that, that was nerve wracking.  Honestly, watching them come in with like this little diabetes poker and just going  diabetes and, uh, oh, and he had diabetes.  No, no, he was just, he had low blood sugar because he was, he was so sorry for yourself.  I hope you don't do that.  How much did he weigh?  Uh, six pounds and six pounds, 13 ounces.  How is it you're big and MJ is a bodybuilder and open Lindsay are kind of small.  Their kid is nine pounds. 
[00:31:00]  Nine pounds, four ounces.  I don't have any idea how that works, but that's a huge baby.  Yeah.  Big bruiser.  Wow.  I hope you get an NFL contract.  If you're smart.  Yeah.  Well, 18 years or whatever.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Make the kid play football.  That's all I would do if I had a big baby.  I wouldn't let it do well in school.  Books are for queers.  I wouldn't say handed a football.  I'd be terrible too with the shots thing.  Cause I'd be old.  Like, I don't want to put in that.  You'd have like old diseases, like polio.  One kid walking around with polio and rickets and shit. 
[00:31:30]  Whooping cough.  Anthony's can't be Travolta in 18 years in a little bubble.  Hopefully with a better wig.  I should have gotten the shots.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Steve.  Steve's kid.  There.  I'm pulled.  Yep.  Almost done.  Going to bring a little Xander in when all the shots are done?  Yes.  Absolutely.  You can't not show your kid off.  That is, and I know that that's part of the whole.  Drinking the Kool-Aid.  Drinking the Kool-Aid.  As they call it.  Falling asleep next to the bean pod. 
[00:32:00]  It is.  You wake up and go, it's not bad.  Matthew.  Matthew.  Fall asleep, Matthew.  It's an automatic.  You see your kid, and you now have to show off your kid and photos to everybody that  even mentions, oh, congratulations.  Oh, here.  Photos.  And it's, like, all about the kid.  Yeah.  Like, everything.  Until you get older, I guess, or the kid gets older, or you have another kid.  Like, that poor second kid.  Oh, I've seen this one firsthand.  The first kid gets the royal treatment of disinfecting and everything. 
[00:32:30]  Um, uh, with, uh, my, uh, my former, um, well, still in-law thing.  I don't even want to get into it, but, uh, there was, uh, not real in-laws.  Girlfriend.  Melinda's, um, uh, brother, uh, brother-in-law and sister had kids.  Right.  And the first kid was, let's wipe down everything with disinfectant in, like, a Denny's.  You'd go to a Denny's.  And, uh, the waitress actually took a coffee pot and was pouring coffee. 
[00:33:00]  And, and the coffee pot went, like, right over the baby's head at one point.  And you're like, hey!  Hey, there's a baby over here!  What happens if that thing just breaks and spills fucking molten coffee on the baby?  And then the second baby, it's just all over at that point.  This shit falls on the floor.  They just pick it up here, shoves it right back in their mouth.  There's dust bunnies on it and fucking maggots.  You make the kid hold the coffee pot when it's hot.  Yeah.  So your coffee doesn't get cold.  It's a good coffee holder.  They put it on his little flat head on the soft spot. 
[00:33:30]  So you don't hold it.  Because you realize, you realize kids are durable.  You realize after that.  They're adorable.  They're adorable.  Yeah, it's like little, the adorable, like, batteries.  Put them on your shoulder, but be careful.  That's Toracell, Chip.  I like how Steve's been a father for four weeks, and now he's some fucking patriarch where he gets to give advice to people.  Patriarch!  Yes, the patriarch of the family.  Yeah, you really are coming off like King Henry the Ass.  I really am. 
[00:34:00]  I'm a fucking smug parenting asshole.  I'm the head of the Carleese clan.  That's right, goddammit.  I don't want that language on television.  My children.  You must protect the children.  I keep my music away from them.  Not for the language, because it sucks.  Isn't it weird, though, that, like, as a month in, you have a lot more knowledge firsthand than opener's wife, because they're, like, a day in.  But that month only is good for, like, say, a few months. 
[00:34:30]  It's almost like if the kid's 14.  Yeah.  If my son is 14 in a month.  Yeah.  Yeah, you cut that month off after a while.  Oh, yeah.  I guess that's after two years?  What, three years?  I'm a fucking month veteran right now.  And then this, yeah, he's right.  Jim's right.  This will all be nothing in a very short amount of time.  Because I'm taking advice from people that have had kids, like, I can't remember.  You're panicking.  I don't fucking know.  It really is.  He's just, like, spewing things that, like, he's hurt. 
[00:35:00]  Like, this whole, like, six weeks thing.  I took my kid out after two and a half weeks.  There's no rule.  Oh, see, that's right.  There's no rule.  We went to Warren's birthday party.  Riley was two and a half weeks old.  Yeah.  I'm not going to run into a guy that's got tuberculosis.  See?  You know?  Like, you don't need all the kids' vaccines.  Travis was, like, out of delivery into the tuberculosis ward of the hospital.  But it's good.  You're supposed to take your kid out so that it can experience sunlight and, you know, other things.  I'm not talking about keeping it in a fucking darkened room. 
[00:35:30]  I'm talking about we were told specifically not to take him out until, like, not take him, like, out to shopping malls and stuff like that until he's had his first round of vaccinations.  I think that's.  All right.  Well, you know, your doctor says one thing.  Oh.  Did you have a Canadian doctor, though?  No.  We've got, you know, we've got an old school doctor who, you know, doesn't overreact like it's 2010.  There's no.  I'm not, like, trashing your doctor or anything, but nothing's going to happen to your beautiful baby boy if you take him to a shopping mall. 
[00:36:00]  Well, that's comforting.  Thank you.  Someone coughs in its face.  Yeah.  Blame Travis.  Although people aren't walking around with SARS masks still once in a while.  That's true.  There's bird flu.  It's just a horrible thing.  That's why.  See?  That's why.  Look at these two varying opinions and everything.  I don't want to.  I don't even want to fucking know that.  I don't want to deal with it.  I don't want to have to know.  I don't want to be worried.  I'd rather just continue licking my own cum off the floor.  Yes.  Things like that.  Sure.  Being single. 
[00:36:30]  No responsibility.  I will agree with Steve that it is the greatest thing in the world.  See?  It really is.  It really is.  Is it the greatest Ozzy Osbourne walking through that door?  No, that's better.  Exactly.  Good.  Is it better than just fucking?  Well, that's two different things.  No, no, because sometimes a baby, I think, would get in the way of the fucking.  Yeah.  Maybe take some of the spontaneity and romance out of something.  Maybe I'm wrong.  Look, I don't know everything. 
[00:37:00]  I got a microphone in front of me, but sometimes I say stupid things into it.  But the truth is, it seems to take spontaneity away from things.  And, you know, you're constantly worrying about this thing.  Like, everybody goes, it's just such a great thing.  It's unconditional love that you have.  I think it's more unconditional worry that you're just petrified that something's now  going to happen to this.  Well, like the first, Riley's 10 months now. 
[00:37:30]  And so for the first six months, it's pretty much just trying to keep the baby alive.  Alive.  That's great.  Like, Ope's going to go home.  And for the first month, there's really not that much to do aside from feed it, make  sure it sleeps, and make sure it doesn't die.  And watch it for things that, like, you know, it's not shitting or it's not doing  something.  You're always going to worry about, you know, whether the kid's all right or not.  So you keep, like, a little CB or something in the room so you can hear it if it's not  What do you do if it stops breathing?  A CB?  What is he, a truck driver? 
[00:38:00]  It's called a baby monitor.  Oh, great.  Breaker 1-9, Breaker 1-9, Trap Dog, you out there?  You got your ears on?  Yeah, I've been needing a little formula over here.  Remember, keep the shiny side up and the dirty side down.  We south side and gone.  Keep it between the dishes, Trav Eye, and by those, I mean your butt cheeks.  We got to get this formula to text Arcanus. 
[00:38:30]  Ah, shit.  I don't know, a CB, that's very good.  They have a baby monitor.  Oh, okay.  Which does run off of some frequency.  I'm not sure which.  But, yeah, that's something that's not new, but relatively speaking.  They didn't have that when I was a kid.  They threw you in there.  They threw you in there in perfect crib death position and then just hoped when they came  in next time from some drunken binge that you were still alive.  That's all.  That's what I did.  We have a video monitor now.  A video monitor? 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, it's really weird.  Can you hear the kids, can you actually hear the kid breathing on this monitor?  No.  No, but I mean on the other one.  How do you know if the kid stops breathing it?  Oh, Jesus.  They sell monitors where it's kind of like a flat board that you put underneath the  crib where it can detect any movement.  And if there's no movement, even breathing for 10 seconds, like a siren will go off.  Wow.  Do you have?  We had that.  We don't have it anymore.  We should get that for Steve.  Yes.  A siren will be going off all the time.  Yes.  I was just resting.  Yes.  Put it on his chair. 
[00:39:30]  Put it on his work chair.  What?  What?  What?  I'm working on something.  I wasn't relaxing.  I was watermarking.  Foundry logoing.  But yeah, just too much responsibility for me.  Me too.  Not into that whole scene.  And believe me, at this point in my life too, I just know it's, I've passed the plateau. 
[00:40:00]  I've passed the...  You practically have kids anyway.  You know, like with your nieces.  I know.  That's fine.  They come over, like I said, shook a little head tussle.  Yeah.  And then time just seems to fly.  I went to my godson's christening years ago, when it's just a little baby.  And then, you know, you're going to do a little dip in the water bullshit.  And then over the weekend, I was at the same kid's communion. 
[00:40:30]  Like, that.  Right.  In like two seconds.  And they're regular like little people things now.  They're like people.  They have their own like thoughts.  And they say stuff.  And it's not just mimicking what you're saying.  Yeah.  It's just so strange.  It's an individual thought.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's kind of weird.  Yeah, after that point, you can't kill it either.  No.  Because now it's like real.  Yeah, you can go, what are you doing?  Yeah.  Nose.  You're being an ass.  Baby, you take that little pillow. 
[00:41:00]  Foosh.  Flunk.  And then you're single again.  Dandy.  But, yeah, and then they'll just go, I don't know what happened.  There's not much they can look at at that point.  They're just kind of, bah, I don't know.  But, you know, if he's seven, it's kind of hard.  Exactly.  It's up a struggle.  Exactly.  You have a little fist print in your face.  What happened?  You can't deck them.  Got that gardening, did you?  Well, congratulations.  Yeah.  To Opie and Lindsay. 
[00:41:30]  I guess Opie's out a week.  Yeah.  Something like that.  That must be nice.  That's like, to me, that's the plus side of having a kid.  It's not a plus.  A week off.  That's not a week off.  The plus side, you'd be getting up every, imagine your week off and you woke up every three hours.  No.  It's not going to be a relaxing week.  I do to vomit.  I do to get the poison out.  And to change your own shitty underpants.  Change my own shitty underpants and puke.  I have to burp myself.  Because, oh, no. 
[00:42:00]  Shut him up.  Can you take care of that?  I'm just going to lay here and sleep.  Do you think that's what Oval do?  Could you, uh, Lance, could you take care of that?  I don't know.  I think he'll be up and helping out.  Yeah, I think she'll see to it.  Yeah.  She might, she might allow that for the first couple weeks to be good natured about it.  Well, she's, you know, got to kind of recover.  So he, he's, he's got to do this, I guess. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, my brother disappeared yesterday during dinner and it was like, oh yeah, he's changing  a diaper.  They got to go into that bathroom with the shelf, with the baby shelf and pull that down  and change babies on it.  Just go in there and piss.  Don't stay in there long enough to shake it so there isn't piss in my underwear.  I'm in and out.  Exactly.  I'm actually taking my cock out as I walk through the restaurant.  I just fucking begin, hopefully no one's even in there. 
[00:43:00]  Because if there's someone that's taking a dump, they get whizzed on their chest and  stomach.  Stepped up to urinals and just pissed on someone's ass.  Oops, didn't know somebody was using this.  They tell me to stay because it's a truck stop.  How does every discussion turn into guys blowing each other?  Just disturbing.  Just a sexy show.  When I was doing a Hannity show, he said that too.  I was like, yeah, you know, me and Jim are going to do the show when Ops out.  And he goes, oh, that ought to be good. 
[00:43:30]  Just a filth ridden program.  I'm like, yes, exactly.  That's how we are.  He said he was up.  He texted me.  He said he was up for like 32 hours or something.  Really?  Yeah.  I guess they went.  It started happening.  Yeah.  I didn't know until like after it was all done.  He texted me like, hey, Mother's Day, Mother's Day, baby.  Which is kind of odd.  Is Mother's Day a floating holiday?  Is that one of those?  It's a Sunday.  It's the Sunday of blah, blah, blah. 
[00:44:00]  I think it's the second Sunday of night.  Oh, so it's not the kid's birthday isn't going to be on Mother's Day every year.  No.  Close enough, though, where Ops is going to probably get a community gift for mother and child every year.  It's close enough.  Here, kid.  Here's a cutlery set.  That sucks for Lizzie, though, because it's like Mother's Day is supposed to be like you take her out.  Yeah.  But now you've got to do the birthday party.  Birthday thing.  But like I said, parents don't care.  They just don't care. 
[00:44:30]  It's all about the kids.  All about the kids.  I feel, I start, the more of my friends that get married, thank God for you, who's just as emotionally immature as I am.  I know.  Everyone I know is getting married and having, you start to feel old, man.  I am in a complete state of rest of development mentally.  I stopped maturing mentally pretty much when I got the radio gig, you know.  I thought you were going to say eight.  Yeah, at about eight. 
[00:45:00]  At about eight.  No, like I was trying to be an adult, and that's why I got into my miserable marriage.  Like I was just trying to be what I was supposed to be at like, you know, 30 or something like that.  Like, oh, that's a big threshold.  It's a big, you know, benchmark birthday.  I better start getting my shit together.  Pull myself up by my bootstraps and be the responsible man.  Because every time I went to where my mom worked, the bar she worked at, 
[00:45:30]  I would sit down and everybody was like, hey, it's Rosie's kid.  Hey, yeah.  And I was always treated like a kid, even as I, you know, became 30 years old.  And I would think, when am I not going to be a kid?  Rosie.  Yeah, my mom.  Oh, that's your mom's name.  Oh, yeah.  They would just be like, hey, Rosie.  Hey, Rosie's kid.  And they'd buy me drinks and shit like that because I was broke.  Broke-ass broke.  And I assumed I had to do something to show everybody and myself that I was maturing. 
[00:46:00]  That I wasn't just some 30-year-old loser and doing the same shit I was doing in my 20s.  And I decided marriage was a great way to kind of enter the world of adulthood.  Ugh!  What a fucking mistake that was.  I should have taken a ball-peen hammer to my head and gone back to, like, a drooling idiot.  That's what I became in the courtroom. 
[00:46:30]  Just leaking money.  But, like, you think you know what you're supposed to do.  And then you reach a point where you figure, you know what?  I'm just going to do what I fucking want to do within the boundaries of not, you know, being homeless or murdering people and things like that.  I stay between the boundaries of the rules and regulations.  But for the most part, I do exactly what I want to do. 
[00:47:00]  Like, I like having my own place, and I like having a girl over.  And I don't want to fucking live with a chick.  Like, we're fighting yesterday, so I'm like, go home.  Go home.  Like, it's not like even throwing somebody out, but it's like, this is going to be an annoying fight.  Yep.  Just go back to your place.  Fucking, I don't feel like hearing this shit.  I don't feel like fighting.  You're on the rag.  Fucking go home.  I can't fuck you.  Yeah, exactly.  We're not going to make up in bed.  And just fucking shut up and go home. 
[00:47:30]  I can't.  I love somebody having their own place to go to.  I don't want to live with somebody.  No.  I know I don't want to be married.  I know I don't.  I was in a place there where I needed a relationship, a live-in relationship.  Like, that's what I did for so many years.  And then after my last long-term relationship, I'd find myself sitting at home, and we talked about this on the air, where I'm sitting at home just kind of alone, watching TV, looking around like, oh, this is weird. 
[00:48:00]  Because I'd never done it before.  But as time's gone on, I'm so getting used to that.  What do you do if you're mad at the girl, if you're together, and she lives with you?  What do you do if you're like, you want to fucking choke each other, and then you just kind of sit there?  I don't get it.  Yeah, that is a tough nut.  So that's why these days, I don't do that either.  I don't have a live-in.  I won't.  It's not one of those deals anymore.  You have some place to go.  I got my place.  That's good for me.  It's – but like I said, getting out of a relationship that lasted eight, nine years, something like that, you kind of fall into this habit where you're so comfortable just – even if you are arguing and stuff and you're miserable, you get into this habit of just having someone else in the house with you, and it becomes a habit. 
[00:48:30]  And it's hard to break when you first break up, and I'm in the house alone.  And, you know, yeah, I've had girls over, things like that, but there are those days where you're just sitting there alone, and I would start looking around going – and you start doing this self-assessment. 
[00:49:00]  Like, again, again, it creeps into my head going, what are you doing?  You know, are you going to be that guy that's laying there, and you got nobody around you and stuff?  And then I just start smacking myself.  I go, no.  I got family.  I got friends.  I got shit like that.  I don't need some broad in the house all the time.  I had a girl tell me one time in an argument as we were breaking up. 
[00:49:30]  She's like, you know, you're going to die alone.  And I have never forgotten that.  That's a good punch in an argument, man.  Yeah.  Oh, you're going to die alone.  You should have told her, so are you, right the fuck now.  I kind of knew she was right, though.  I was such an awful boyfriend.  Were you?  Oh, she was, I don't know, we were just kind of giving each other the boot, but that might  have been her revenge for me, but I'll bust up her fucking 20 years ago.  But I always remember that slam, you're going to die alone.  That is a good one. 
[00:50:00]  Because I was a sex addict, and she knew it, and I knew it, and it was, I couldn't commit.  It's like, you feel trapped when you're, to me, when you're with somebody, like, for real,  like, if you live together, you're married, that's the ceiling.  Like, I don't mind having a girlfriend.  I don't mind not fucking other girls, but I know that if we both stop liking each other,  we can walk away.  Right, right.  There's no financially binding contract that keeps you in things.  But yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was just hard to get used to at first, but I've definitely gotten used to it.  Like, I don't think about it anymore.  If I'm just sitting there playing some online poker, got some crappy TV show on, I'm not 
[00:50:30]  assessing my life thinking I'm failing in some aspect of my life because there's not  somebody living with me in my house.  I just think, fuck this.  This is great.  I'm having fun.  I don't care.  I'll see you next week.  So he wanted a kid, though.  It's not like, they didn't have an accident.  Like, he was like, I wanted one.  He wants another one.  Like, they want to have kids.  It's like, it's fine if that's what you want.  He's been of that mindset for a while.  Like, he wanted the wife, the kid, the kids, things like that. 
[00:51:00]  And you can kind of tell from his family, you know, that's kind of what they do.  He has nieces and nephews and stuff like that.  And he wants kids.  They're like Vikings.  There's 80 of them in every house.  I know.  It's raising an entire clan.  It's, you know, and people say, you know, well, but what about, you know, carrying on  your, yourself?  Like, there's this whole instinct, I guess, that I don't have of keeping your, your gene 
[00:51:30]  pool going.  You know, aside from the fact that my brother has a kid.  So the bloodline continues in some way, shape or form, even though it's not a boy, a masculine  child.  But to me, I'm like, I don't, I don't think so far has been this great special fucking thing  that I need to continue, that I need this whole thing to just keep going for a millennia. 
[00:52:00]  Uh, I don't care.  End it with me.  I'm fine with that.  I feel the same way about you.  I mean, I feel that the Nortons, if we keep going fine, if not, who's going to notice?  Who's going to, like, like, really, but is, it is a very strong instinct and it's so primal  to just keep your, your bloodline going and, and keep yourself up in that upper echelon 
[00:52:30]  of, of, uh, you know, you're the intelligent, you're the strong, your genes have to keep  moving on and, and, uh, going in order for the earth to be strong.  Fuck that.  Put me in a ditch and forget about the, the name, let the cold wind and leaves blow over  the tombstone until it's one of those old ones.  People point out, wow, look at that cares.  I want to, that's, I think that's why I'm obsessed with work.  Cause I don't want to have kids.  That's my way of fucking just like living on is like, just keep doing work. 
[00:53:00]  I think it's on tape for a while.  Yeah.  The more unforgettable you are, like the more, that's how long you stay for.  So I figure I just keep doing that.  That's where my, that's probably where my obsession is filtered through.  I'm sure some of the old celebrities from, uh, the early days of television thought the  same thing.  Hey, I'll live on forever on kinescope.  No, you won't.  Who pulls the, out the kinescope player?  I do.  Oh, you do?  Sure.  Some of those?  Yeah, I do.  Oh, Uncle Paul. 
[00:53:30]  Kinescope.  It's like a mouthwash.  Is it?  Yeah.  You.  We, uh, we, uh, oof, I gotta piss.  Do you gotta piss?  Yeah.  All right.  We'll take a little breaky and then we'll come back and see what, um, what's lined up  there.  I see people every day, uh, come in here in the studio and they lay down little discs and,  uh, uh, stories.  There's, um, Tiger, I guess.  X-rated gaff. 
[00:54:00]  Anchor's flub.  There's no reason for Tiger's tourney withdrawal.  I don't know.  We'll have to see what that's all about.  Uh, and Obama, this annoyed me, of course, because Obama said it, but, um, he's a little  angry with technology.  Why?  Uh, because, uh, it's all against him.  Uh, we'll, we'll tell you about it after we piss.  Oh, speaking of technology, cherry darts, if you'd like them thrown at your hiney, this 
[00:54:30]  Friday, what's the date, Danny?  The 14th.  The 14th of April, we will be, are we in April or May?  May.  Yes, in exactly, almost a year.  In, uh, Friday the 14th, we're going to have cherry darts again, which is, uh, couples come  in and they put, we put whipped cream on your hiney and, and your, or your partner or whoever  you want throws a cherry at your hiney and whoever gets the closest to like a bullseye,  you know, we filter it down and there's eventually a winner and you get, uh, the first prize is, is 
[00:55:00]  an iPad for you and your partner.  That's two iPads from Steven Singer.  They're both diamond encrusted wow logos.  It's really a very, very cool first prize.  And it's like, what are you going to do?  Wait in line to get an iPad like every other asshole?  Get a nice one for free.  Bejeweled.  A bejeweled one from Steven Singer, who by the way, uh, puts out those wonderful, uh, 24  carat gold, uh, thank God Mother's Day's over.  I was about ready to vomit with all of the reads. 
[00:55:30]  How many reads we got today?  No reads, huh?  Two?  Three?  Something like that?  Three.  I mean, there's not even a read for the new Jim Norton iPhone app, which is amazing that  there's no read for the Jim Norton iPhone app.  There doesn't have to be because let me tell you something.  Word of mouth is good enough.  I was sitting on the turlet yesterday just playing Jimmy Norton sounds.  Wah, wah, penis as I was taking a dump, just laughing at Jimmy Norton sounds. 
[00:56:00]  I had to explain, because I didn't think it worked, so I called the manufacturer, like  the guy who, man who did it for me.  I'm like, dude, the fucking sounds don't work on this.  He's like, is your volume off?  Turn the volume up.  I'm like, yeah.  Oh, you asshole.  I don't know how to use my own app.  Wah, wah, penis.  Wah, wah, penis.  I'm 41 years old.  Yes.  And I knew that was going on the app, and I approved it.  And there's like a bunch of ringtones.  It's like fucking, there's the oral treat sound. 
[00:56:30]  That's a fun one.  I was playing that while I was beating off.  Sexy.  Yeah.  All your favorite.  Oh, look.  What a way to wake you up.  Honey, time to get up.  Fucking idiocy.  Just idiocy.  And then somebody actually goes, because, you know, there's like dates on it, and there's  a whole bunch of shit on it, and 20 ringtones or whatever, and somebody's like, dude, I  could get that for free, you know? 
[00:57:00]  It's 99 cents, you twat.  It's 99 cents, and yeah.  What are you complaining about?  For free?  Have you read any of the reviews on iTunes yet?  Yeah, they're actually pretty good.  Yeah, there's some good reviews.  I think some of them are fans.  Apparently someone implied I died of AIDS in my review.  Every bunch of reviews I get for anything, one of them says I poured into it.  Jimmy Norton died of AIDS, Chip Chipperson always chimes in 40 times, Uncle Paul molests  somebody in the reviews, and fucking Ted sells them at an emporium. 
[00:57:30]  It's very silly.  Ah, shit.  So I guess we'll come back.  Yes, we'll take a little break.  By the way, we were talking about Cherry Darts, and if you want to enter Cherry Darts-  Oh, sorry, yes, yes, yes.  You only have today and tomorrow to enter.  Why is that?  Because those are the official rules that have been set upon us.  Why can't it be-  How fucking stupid!  Why can't it be right up until, like, we do it?  I have no idea.  I don't know.  All right, look, we'll work on that.  They want us what?  They want us to-  They want us to-  They want us to legally have time to go through and pick based on- 
[00:58:00]  Find out if people have some kind of parking tickets or something.  Well, there had to be criteria to entering, so we had to-  Like?  Well, essay is one of the criterias, and the essay is, I want to enter the contest.  So we have to judge-  Wait, I don't get that.  Each contest has to have three criteria legally.  Yeah.  To enter it?  Yeah, like, we had to-  They said, what's the criteria to enter? 
[00:58:30]  And I just sent the email.  Can I say the criteria should be that you're over 18?  Yeah.  You have to be over 21.  Over 20-  Why?  Why?  I don't know.  Why?  We've had 18-year-old girls do this.  You're old enough to go to the fucking electric chair at 18.  Yes.  Here's what the criteria should be.  You're over 18, you're a resident of the United States, and-  And you have an anus.  And you have an anus that was not surgically put on within the last six months.  You obviously sign a release. 
[00:59:00]  There needs to be three judging criteria so nobody thinks that the judging was done unfairly.  So you have to say, why did you pick them?  What is this?  Who wants to be a millionaire?  We're throwing fucking cherries at girls' assholes.  But wait a minute.  That's just to enter the contest?  Yeah.  How about if you have those criteria?  If you're over 18, the first 50 couples-  Yes.  Well, no, there's a limit of 10.  Yeah, there's a limit of 10 couples.  Can we just make this easy?  What are you guys doing? 
[00:59:30]  I'm in the same face that you did.  Guys, what are you doing?  They're making it so one couple shows up, if we're lucky.  We do have couples lined up.  It's going down.  Yeah, we know it is.  But it's like lawyers, I understand they have a job to do, and you've got to protect the company.  I mean, you really do.  They're over-lawyering, though.  But it's like, what is there to do?  Legally, fucking couples should be able to come down until day of as long as they can prove how old they are.  That's the way it should be.  Have ID, come in, have cherries thrown at your ass.  All right, well, it's Opie Anthony, one word, Opie Anthony, at SiriusXM.com. 
[01:00:00]  Today or tomorrow, the first prizes are great.  So just, you know, and it's a lot of fun.  We should play some audio today and tomorrow.  Ooh, yeah, a couple of clips of some fun moments.  Yeah, your girl, your chick is not going to be treated like shit.  It really is like a very, very fun event, and it's silly.  No, we're very nice.  Yeah.  Do you guys remember last time we played, we had some surprisingly good-looking women?  A lot of hot chicks came, yeah.  And then there was just this one, like, older mess.  Oh, God, the mess. 
[01:00:30]  And she wouldn't take her socks off.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't remember that.  Really?  She was the fat ass, right?  She was tremendous.  The fat ass.  The fatter the ass, though, the bigger the target.  Well, you know, I think the bigger the outside target.  But the asshole's the asshole.  Yeah, she had to spread it extra wide, you know, because there was just so much flesh.  Oh, God, I remember that.  And that coming up on the heels of ass girl.  She was, yeah, she was one of them. 
[01:01:00]  She was one of them.  Oh, my God.  And that was just ridiculous.  I was yelling at people to get out of the way because they were blocking my view of her ass.  Fantastic.  Can she enter again?  I would say yes.  The lawyers probably would say no.  So, my goodness gracious.  So, today or tomorrow, send an email.  Yeah.  We want people to come down.  We don't want it to be five couples.  We want to have a fucking full house.  Yeah, a lot of fun.  A lot of people.  Yeah.  Cherry darts.  Come on.  It's a festive event.  We don't do enough of these. 
[01:01:30]  I know.  We got to do more.  We got to do more of these.  Yeah, and any whores that want to drop by this week, feel free.  Yes.  Feel free.  It's whore week.  Oh.  On the Opie and Anthony show with Opie out, featuring, of course, James Norton and Danny  on the board.  The incompetent Sam on the computer.  It's an unfair assessment.  Although, I'm noticing you're getting a little better because the Wilford Brimley popped right  up.  So, I got it if you want to look again.  But, yeah, I saw.  Unfortunately, I've seen no porno yet, which Danny peruses every so often, and it gets 
[01:02:00]  me a little thrill and gets me through the day.  Yeah, type in Wilford Brimley.  Nude.  Okay.  Nude.  All right.  We'll take a break, and we'll be right back.  Big balls and hard cocks and sweaty man assholes.  Docking and gaping and smelling some ball sack.  Little teetie stomachs and twinks that like to sing.  These are a few of my gay things. 
[01:02:30]  Prancing around in lame Bryant blouses, tying a string to the tails of mouses, putting  my mouth near a fat glory hole.  I hope someone cute is sitting on the pole.  Having my butt fucked while he calls me Stevie, taking some cum from Governor McGreevey, fisting  and felching and burping up, cum, these are a few of my gay things. 
[01:03:00]  When I'm feeling bad, I simply get some shit on my dick, and then I don't feel so sad.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know why that cracks me up so much, but the Steve songs. 
[01:03:30]  Hi, everybody.  Opie and Anthony.  Program.  Program.  Opie's on paternity leave.  Had his baby.  Well, Lindsey had a baby.  He's married to Lindsey, so in essence, so is he.  And it was his spermatozoa that fertilized the egg.  Certainly was.  That started the dividing process.  And then it makes a baby.  I don't know how it does that.  It's a miracle.  Over the weekend, boy, some of the movies, huh? 
[01:04:00]  Huh?  I didn't go see any.  Furry Vengeance, I understand.  Sweeping the nation.  Furry Vengeance.  With a shit broom.  Did it drop off, or did it pick up?  Because I thought it was going to have a slow opening weekend, but then really take off.  Oh, oh, I just heard, oh.  Got to click a link, because it's not in the top five.  Not anymore.  Not anymore.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, okay.  It made four million bucks this weekend. 
[01:04:30]  How much did it make total?  It's got 7%.  7%.  Positive.  7%.  Positive.  That's good.  It was 2%, so it is almost four-fold improved.  Yeah.  Look at that.  To date, it came out on April 30th, and it has made $11.6 million.  Wow.  Yes.  Yeah.  11.  That's not good.  Is there a way to see comparable movies that have made $11 million?  Is there a way to look at movies that have made around $11 million? 
[01:05:00]  Sure.  $10 million, $11 million, $12 million.  Maybe, you know, just get kind of a line on where the movie sits.  It's because we're biased.  Yes.  Because Jimmy and Patrice are in that film.  Yes, we are.  Well, like Iron Man 2, for instance.  That one made $133 million in one week.  So that's like not as good.  Right.  I mean, once you're talking about millions, what difference does it make?  Yeah.  How much do you need to be happy? 
[01:05:30]  Right.  Right.  If you hear millions, it's like, all right, $11, $150-some-odd million.  Yeah, Iron Man really raked it in.  Raked it in.  And mixed reviews on that one?  I know our own Dan is kind of an expert on some of the sci-fi movies.  What's the word on the street, Dan?  For Iron Man?  Yeah.  Well, I've heard both reports. 
[01:06:00]  Some say it's great.  Some say there's way too much.  I heard that it was kind of like Spider-Man 3-ish, where there was too much stuff going on,  too much shit going on.  You know, just because there's a 2 next to it, that means that they have to put double  the amount of shit inside.  Yeah.  Why is that?  I don't know.  But I mean, it got pretty decent reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, so.  I saw it was not Spider-Man 3-ish.  I checked it out.  Spider-Man 3 was bad.  Like, it was rushed.  So you're saying Spider-Man wasn't in this?  Spider-Man was not featured.  I'm saying that it wasn't like Spider-Man 3. 
[01:06:30]  No Spider-Man.  Right.  No Spider-Man.  Or Venom was not featured in this film.  Venom.  Right.  The only thing bad about Iron Man 2 was that they just chalk-filled it with Marvel references  that were just obvious, like, setups to this movie's coming out, that movie's coming  out, this movie's.  Are you kidding me?  Yeah.  They used it like a kind of a commercial?  It was like Scarlett Johansson and Samuel L. Jackson in it.  They were only in it.  Motherfucker!  Right.  They were in Iron Man 2?  Yes.  But the only reason they were really in it was because they're going to be in the Avengers 
[01:07:00]  movie.  Like a walk-on for-  But they were in it for like a lot of the movies.  So, but the only purpose they really served was to say, like, oh, I'm interested in these  characters.  I'd like to see their film.  They didn't really add a whole lot to the Iron Man story.  But they weren't the characters that they're going to be in the film?  No, they were.  They were the same, like, it was the Avengers making a cameo in Iron Man.  And it was just because-  Why would they do that?  What is she-  You know how you do that?  Here's what you do.  You have Scarlett Johansson come in and go, I can't wait to show my fat tits in the 
[01:07:30]  Avengers.  Oh, my God.  And then the film would, like, rake in some big bucks.  A lot of money.  And then there was, like, a quick little Captain America reference to make you go,  oh, Captain America's coming.  A little Thor reference.  Oh, Thor is coming up.  Who's playing who?  I know that guy, Hugo Weaving, I think, is playing Red Skull, Captain America's arch nemesis.  Hugo Weaving?  Arch nemesis, I think.  You mean the guy from The Matrix?  I think so.  Mr. Anderson. 
[01:08:00]  That guy.  Agent Smith.  I never heard of him.  Oh, my God.  The Matrix?  You know when you see him.  Oh, yeah.  And he was in Lord of the Rings.  I never saw those, either.  No?  I don't know why.  I would see him.  That's one of those things people either love or hate, too.  The Lord of the Rings movie.  Like, I could throw that on and watch that.  I have no problem with those.  People call me a faggot.  Regardless of what you're watching.  Yeah, it doesn't matter what I'm watching.  Just if I could be watching fucking UFC, I'm a faggot.  And, like, Samuel L. Jackson's going to be playing the same character in every Marvel movie that comes out. 
[01:08:30]  Because that character...  Glassman?  No.  That wasn't Marvel.  Oh, what was it?  That was Unbreakable, I think.  Unbreakable.  Yes.  He played the glass guy.  Right.  That's not...  That kept breaking.  He's playing Nick Fury now.  Nick Fury?  Yeah.  I'm Nick Fury, motherfucker!  Yeah.  Does he say motherfucker?  No.  Do they make him say,  I'm tied to these motherfucking snakes on this motherfucking plane,  and then add it into the movie because he didn't say motherfucker enough? 
[01:09:00]  No.  Oh, how horrible is that?  But other than that, I thought it was very good.  I liked it maybe better than the first one.  Wow, the reviews are in.  Yeah.  Better than the first one?  No.  Maybe.  I can't see that.  Mickey Rourke was very good.  Sam Rockwell was very good.  Sam Rockwell is great in everything he's in, including Iron Man 2.  Sam Rockwell is the most underrated, great, fucking just cool actor. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  The guy was fantastic.  Did you see Moon?  Not yet, but I'm going to.  I plan on.  That was good.  He's good in that.  That stupid Galaxy Quest movie?  Yeah.  He was the funny guy in that.  Playing Chuck Barris as the spy.  The guy's very good in his little eclectic roles.  Eclectic roles.  Yeah.  So what about visually?  Good visually?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Good visually.  Lots of action. 
[01:10:00]  Like CGI looked good and shit?  Yeah.  It all looked real good.  Because, man, when he was flying around as Iron Man in the first one, there was some cool shit right there.  Yeah.  And he was doing other, like in one scene, he gets completely intoxicated in the Iron Man outfit.  Oh, no.  Drunk Iron Man.  Yeah.  He just starts fucking around.  Blowing shit up?  Yeah.  It's great.  All right.  That sounds fun.  But you can't tell.  Sometimes you think it's a real suit.  Sometimes you think it's CGI.  It's good.  That's good.  It's good.  All right.  Well, good for that.  Who's playing Thor, by the way? 
[01:10:30]  Thor.  Thor.  Yeah.  So far, a lot of the cast is rumored.  Yeah.  But the rumored Thor is a man named Chris Hemsworth.  What?  That's a movie star name.  Oh, Chris Hemsworth.  Chris Hemsworth.  Chris Hemsworth.  What has he been in?  What has he done?  Are they looking for unknowns?  I was excited because Triple H was rumored to play Thor for a while.  He was in Star Trek.  That was really...  Oh.  Triple H wouldn't be a bad choice for Thor.  He was George Kirk.  It looks like him.  Oh, he was Kirk's father. 
[01:11:00]  I agreed with him.  Oh, okay.  Kirk's father.  He was at the beginning of the movie and he died, yeah, crashing into the ship.  Is that Kirk's father?  Yeah.  In the new...  Hemsworth.  Hemsworth.  How did I not recognize the name?  Oh, my God.  Hemsworth.  Who the hell knows?  I...  On On Demand, on the wonderful system that I call Fios.  Wonderful Verizon cable system.  Yeah. 
[01:11:30]  That goddamn Avatar is available now.  And last night, I was going through my HD channels and saw Avatar on there.  And I'm like, you know what?  I have not seen Avatar.  I hear people talking about it.  And I should see it.  So I took my remote.  I pointed it at the TV.  And promptly hit purchase for aliens.  And because I didn't give a shit about Avatar and I wanted to go to sleep, so I just put 
[01:12:00]  on aliens and didn't even make it to the part where they started shooting.  I've paid for aliens so many times.  I own it.  But I'm so lazy that I will just lay in bed and order pay-per-view things that I have  that I could just put in my DVD player.  But I'm too lazy and then I fall asleep.  This is why I love being in this show, because most people's meaningless displays of wealth  are buying Porsches or Lamborghinis. 
[01:12:30]  People that just, you know, ah, I bought a Porsche.  I don't even need it.  But it's like, you know, things are so crazy lately.  I will actually purchase on pay-per-view a movie that I own on DVD.  I will just purchase it.  I'm talking, I'm blowing $3 there that I had just lying around.  So wait, what are you saying?  There's a spy report.  Now, apparently somebody's going to yell that outside.  Oh, my God.  Why?  This is just in.  I don't know.  The spy report is Iraq is screaming at Mars outside. 
[01:13:00]  I just got a text right outside that door.  The planet or our engineer?  Yes, they're fighting it out for a position on the new chart of the solar system.  Iraq is angry that Mars is throwing his orbit off and bringing him too close to the sun.  Iraq's yelling, call me Mr. Pitter.  Too Pitter.  He's all annoyed. 
[01:13:30]  Thank you.  All right, Iraq.  Oh, here comes a very annoyed Iraq.  He's hot under the collar, as they say.  Hot under the collar.  Yes, he is.  And very bulbous above the collar.  Oh.  But it's okay.  That's right.  All right.  Iraq, the spy report.  Iraq is screaming at Mars outside.  No, not necessarily true.  Oh.  That's the information I received.  Rumor.  This is a messenger.  Rumor.  No, we had, we were told that some of our headphones are missing. 
[01:14:00]  We usually have a bunch behind the TV here.  Sean's headphones in the producer's studio are missing, and he came in asking if we knew  where these were.  And you said, fuck you, you Puerto Rican.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Did you?  Why Iraq?  I should have, but I did not.  Oh.  Okay.  No.  All righty.  So, we didn't know where it was, so Steve and I say, well, why don't we come and ask  Mars?  So, we ask Mars.  Mars goes, I don't know.  How am I supposed to know about this?  Oh, shit.  So, you detect a little hostility toward you? 
[01:14:30]  At this point, Steve had taken over the conversation with Mars.  Yes.  He said, well, you handle the equipment.  Little Xander.  No, the headphones.  So, Steve says, you know, you handle the equipment.  You know, we got to find out.  We thought maybe the Ron and Fez people might have packed him up from Friday.  Now we're blaming Ron and Fez.  Yeah, he thinks Pepper Hicks stole the headphones.  Ah, blaming Pepper.  All right.  All right.  Now, the blame game is happening.  Fingers are being pointed.  The thing was, we asked Mars if he knew, and Mars got very defensive. 
[01:15:00]  So, at this point, I just let Steve deal with it, and I walked down the hallway.  And then the last thing I heard was my name being mentioned, but I didn't know why.  Where did the yelling come from?  Yes.  I'm getting to that.  Anthony is trying to fast forward this.  No, this is an awful story.  In real time.  You don't have to tell it.  Hang on a second.  I am sorry.  Oh, damn.  He's right.  So, I turn around, and I said, Steve, what was that?  And he was being defensive again.  It's a treadmill.  He's like, I don't know where. 
[01:15:30]  Oh.  Sorry.  Oh.  See, that was unnecessary and not part of the story.  I'm sorry.  So, I asked Steve, you know, what happened?  And Mars, again, was being defensive, and he goes, why don't you ask that little fuck  Eric?  Oh.  No, he didn't.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah, that little.  No, he didn't.  Yeah, really.  Inaccurate.  So, later.  That's not just commenting.  So, later, I see Mars in the hallway. 
[01:16:00]  I go, what is your problem?  And he ignores me.  I go, okay, walk away, and he walks into the engineering room.  You told him to walk away.  Yeah, he listened to you.  Yeah.  What happened?  So, where was the problem?  Don't be literal.  No.  So, there was no problem.  We were asked where the headphones were, so we asked Mars where the headphones were.  Is Mars' job to know where the headphones are?  I would guess they're the ones that were here from the studio and the producer's studio.  They're not yours, Ops, or Jim's that we take out of here. 
[01:16:30]  Who else is, like, we all have ours.  So, which ones are missing, and is he responsible for them?  Apparently, there's like one or two that were missing from that room, and they're usually  a lot more behind the TV.  Yeah, hold your hand out.  You're not nervous, are you?  Oh, my God.  You got the DTs.  Yeah, what's the matter with you?  I don't know.  Heart attack.  I don't know.  Oh, Jesus.  By the way, my humble apologies for actually allowed reading.  The Spyro report starting this whole ball in motion.  Exactly.  It wasn't much of a story. 
[01:17:00]  Some kind of big headphones.  Exactly.  I don't even know why we brought up, so I apologize.  It just seemed like something, the yelling outside.  If there's ever any yelling between our staff members, we liked knowing why, and fair  enough.  I guess him saying...  No, he called me a little fuck for absolutely no reason when we just asked, did he know where  the headphones were?  Yeah.  And he got all defensive and pissed off.  So you don't think you should have been spoken to like that after being humiliated for $500  last week?  All of a sudden, now you're being yelled at by Mars.  Fair enough.  Yeah, it's not on the air, so it doesn't...  Have you gotten any of that money? 
[01:17:30]  I mean, that Sam has?  No.  But I've gotten reports about what he's been doing with the money.  Yeah.  Yeah.  People have been sending me messages, so...  Concert tickets and...  Troy wanted to see a show over the weekend.  Sneakers and bundles of socks.  Oh, you got some new sneaks?  Yeah.  I got some new kicks.  I'm not wearing them to work yet.  Yeah.  You know, I'm keeping them clean for now, but...  Are they as nice as the fucking pieces of shit that he rocked on with?  They're slightly nicer.  His spats sneakers?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:18:00]  Fucking putting on the rich shoes.  Oh, you rock.  So is there just going to be this big, pissy, fucking, a pissed mist all around me?  I have no idea, because...  The office now?  I have no idea what his problem is.  I can't wait.  We just asked him a simple question, and he got all defensive.  We'll hear Mars' side.  Maybe because there's cupcakes here.  We heard you badmouthing his wife's cakes, possibly.  Oh, shit.  Like, oh, these are good, as opposed to those fucking lumpy things he brings in. 
[01:18:30]  I happen to like his wife's cakes.  Yeah.  But Iraq is not fond of it.  Here he is.  Uh-oh.  Hey, Mars, how about your side of the story?  This little fuck was talking about you.  I don't understand what the problem is.  I have no problem.  Everything in America!  Yeah!  Shut up.  The sharks!  He's coming in.  It's the sharks.  Oh, the sharks suck.  They would dance fight.  Who's that?  Oh, I fucking hate West Side Story.  Dance fighting stinks.  I hate it.  I hate it, too. 
[01:19:00]  I hate it, too.  Interracial relationships.  Ugh.  But you know the sharks won that fight, right?  I wouldn't know.  Did they?  Yeah.  No.  They stabbed one and shot one.  Riff got stabbed, but what happened to fucking the Puerto Rican?  He got stabbed, too, but somebody got shot, right?  Oh, I don't know.  They didn't have guns, did they?  Who enjoys this?  I guess they did back when it first came out.  I guess they did back when it first came out.  What?  And they're putting on these over-the-top Puerto Rican accents. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, it just blows.  Because every Puerto Rican's a lousy chicken.  Here come the jets like a...  Yeah, they made...  Puerto Rican and chicken, they made rhyme.  You can't do that this day.  You could say figure and then rhyme it with some other adversary.  Trigger.  Yeah.  All right, so what happened?  There's no problem.  I don't have any problem.  Well, you insulted Eric.  Oh, he thinks I did.  You called him little fuck.  Yeah.  I would take offense.  No, I didn't say little fuck.  I said fat fuck.  Oh, shit. 
[01:20:00]  See, that's on my feet.  E-Rock changed it to little fuck.  E-Rock heard just the opposite.  I said fat fuck.  Okay.  Now, to deal with the headphones, I'm not here on the weekends, just like you guys are not here,  so I don't know where the headphones are.  Right.  I don't feel that it's my responsibility to go track them down if they're missing from the studio.  They weren't here on Saturday.  So right away, when I'm asked, I'm more like, it's not asking, it's more like, you should know where they are. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  Well, I know where Opie, Anthony's, and Jimmy's headphones are, and the guests.  That's your responsibility.  That's correct.  But not the hidden headphones.  Right.  And normally we have a bunch back there, but I think they're all here.  I think Eric's just making a mistake with anything missing.  This is, by the way, a brand new segment called Who Gives a Shit on the Opie and Anthony show.  Let's cut our losses here.  Yeah.  It's called Who Gives a Shit.  Oh, it's a terrible segment. 
[01:21:00]  I wasn't even coming in, but since you said my name, I came in, but it's not deserving of any fucking radio time.  So we have a great show here starting now.  We done?  Yeah, you too.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Anytime a spy report comes up there and blood isn't involved.  My apologies.  Actual blood shed.  We have Al Jackson, which we'll be having come in shortly, is here.  Yes.  And then Dana White's calling at 9.15, and I'm going to clear my throat like the defendant in a rape trial.  Much better.  You're used to that. 
[01:21:30]  I certainly am.  Dana's got some news.  Yeah, just kicked a couple people out of UFC.  He just boots people out, rules with an iron fist.  Yeah, he doesn't fucking...  What do you got?  If you guys want, we have, excuse me, Dana White audio from the UFC press conference.  Stop dropping things.  I didn't.  I almost did.  You're dropping it.  It's a good save.  Yeah, Kimbo.  Awesome.  All right, here's Dana.  I don't give a shit if he's the best 170-pounder in the world.  He'll never come back here again.  We're talking Paul Bailey. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  You're cutting him from here.  He'll never come back.  I'm probably the most lenient guy in sports, and this is probably one of the most lenient  organizations, and I, you know, we're all human.  We all make mistakes.  Things happen.  There's no, there's no excuse for that.  These guys are professional athletes.  You don't ever hit a guy blatantly after the belt like that, whether you're frustrated  or not, and it was probably one of the dumbest things I've ever seen, because he is a talented  guy, and he is one of the best 170-pounders in the world, and I was actually impressed 
[01:22:30]  with his takedown defense, because, you know, there isn't wrestling in England.  He's obviously been working on his wrestling game, and it was just, he's beat all the top  guys at 170 pounds, comes in and faces Koscheck, who's a good fighter, and hung in there.  You know, the stuff like the eye gouging, the hit after the bell, all that stuff, that  will not ever be tolerated, and he's done.  I don't care if he fights in every show all over the world and becomes the best, and everybody  thinks he's the pound-for-pound best in the world, he will never fight in the UFC ever 
[01:23:00]  again.  Wow.  Done.  Done.  He's mad.  Because he's getting...  Did you see it?  I did.  Yeah, I mean, Sam is on TMZ.  It's a big one, and UFC is trying to get legalized in New York, and there's a guy named Bob Riley  I hear is the guy who's holding it up, which is disgraceful.  His own personal...  What's...  When these dummies bring their...  They're supposed to be representative of their constituency.  Not the other way around. 
[01:23:30]  I cannot stand when these holier-than-thou shitheads that are running the show do things because  they feel, personally, in their life, that they don't like something.  Yep.  Bob Riley is the guy to contact him, but send good letters.  Honestly, don't send nasty ones, because it just makes...  It's like, if you want UFC in New York, you gotta at least sound like you're an informed  voter.  Wow.  That was a late hit.  Wow.  And the ref takes him down?  Yeah, the ref has to protect the other fighter.  It's like, put him in a chokehold or some shit. 
[01:24:00]  I was decent.  Ah!  Oh, we know Al.  Okay.  Right?  It begins already.  Al Jackson.  You just walked in, for God's sake, with the racial humor.  A lot of people know Al.  He and I have worked together many, many times, and he warmed up for me when I did my HBO  special and Down and Dirty, so people know Al.  He's a very funny comedian.  Yes.  How y'all feeling, man?  We're watching the UFC stuff.  Welcome to the program.  Are you a UFC guy?  Yeah, I am, actually.  You do?  Yeah, yeah.  That hit after the bell was, wow.  Well, Kostchek, Sam said Kostchek said that he said something to him. 
[01:24:30]  At the press conference, Kostchek said that he wouldn't say what it was, but he said as  soon as the bell, as soon as the round ended, and he was on top of him, he just whispered  something in his ear that was, he said, not pleasant.  Yeah, well, you gotta...  And so the guy got up and punched him in his face.  You gotta be professional.  I didn't see it.  How far after?  Like, was it straight up?  Yeah, that fight was over.  Yeah, we just watched the clip, and it's blatant.  Yeah, watch.  The fight's over.  The fight's over.  Bam.  And the ref...  Yeah.  Wow, the UFC ref's really gotta be some bad asses, too. 
[01:25:00]  That was off the chain.  Because he just put him in a chokehold.  That should be happening outside of a nightclub in Manhattan or something like that.  That's a nice little bounce of breakup.  Yeah, a nice bounce of breakup.  Just put him in a chokehold, dragged him over, dragged him away.  Fight's over, and it's like a few...  Yeah, I mean, it's not like it's a minute after.  Wow, that was a hard left hook.  How embarrassing.  Koscheck didn't even move.  That's the scarier thing.  He didn't move.  He shook that off like it was nothing.  And then Koscheck said it was his best hit throughout the entire fight.  It was after the fight.  Yeah, it's pretty good. 
[01:25:30]  He was like, yeah, he hit me good.  It was his best hit the whole night.  That's pretty insulting.  So, yeah, I guess, so Dana threw Daly out.  Threw him out.  And Kimbo he cut.  And Kimbo he took out because, what, he sucks?  Is that pretty much it?  I think that's what it is.  Yeah.  I think he got exposed for what he was, as a dude that was beating up guys in the neighborhood.  Yeah, there was videos of him in people's backyards, just punching the fuck out of other people.  Knocking all the mailbox.  He was a menace to society, as they say, in people's backyards. 
[01:26:00]  Wasn't there one clip where he just gets out of an Escalade with his buddies, goes in the backyard, beats the living piss out of someone, and then gets back in the Escalade and leaves?  Yeah, he was a street fighter in Florida, but he was always fighting big guys, and he wasn't a cunt about it.  Like, he seemed like a nice dude.  He seems like a nice guy.  I feel like that was the surprising thing.  I think he was nicer than people thought he was.  Like, look at the size.  He was just beating up, bare-fisted in parking lots, really big guys, and then he would fight, too, and he wouldn't hit guys while they were down. 
[01:26:30]  What a guy.  But he just knocked down.  What, he's fighting the guy from Ring King right now?  I know, this looks like 1970s footage.  Look at the afro on that dude.  It looks like a giant Dwayne from What's Happening.  And the guy is on one knee, and he just wants no part of Kimbo.  He doesn't want to get back up.  Kimbo looks like a crazy homeless guy.  Yes, he does.  With that big beard.  And as far as beating up people in the hood, I guess he's very good, but he hasn't been spectacular.  I'm just going to say, to the black guy, that's not going to get you a lot of respect.  Staying on one knee when you're clearly okay. 
[01:27:00]  He's saying, I just don't want to do this anymore.  Now the fat, balding white guy.  It looks like Bob Kelly is fighting him.  The guy's not that fat.  He's pretty big.  But these are all guys that kick ass in the neighborhood.  No, these are tough dudes.  He was fighting bouncers.  These guys are local bouncers at the nightclubs.  Yeah.  I mean, Kimbo can definitely, in a street sense, definitely can fucking fit.  Fist fight and take care of himself outside of a club.  Yeah.  He's not fighting people that are trained to defend against that, that know his style,  that can take him down onto the mat. 
[01:27:30]  So, you know, yeah, you could beat people up, but oh, that went right on his face.  So, if you're Kimbo, what's next for you?  Like, what do you, what do you...  My thing is, well, he came, Kimbo came into the UFC.  Dana really shit-talked him for a while.  But then Dana kind of softened up and said, hey, you know what?  The guy wants to go through, because he was making a lot of money at Elite XC.  He was making, like, fucking 500,000 a fight.  Yeah.  So, Dana said, let him go through the Ultimate Fighter and come in.  And he did okay.  And then I think he went, like, he lost two fights. 
[01:28:00]  He lost his last one pretty badly, and he cut him.  He just didn't feel that he was up to it.  But he cut him nicely.  He didn't...  And he could make a lot of money with Kimbo.  Didn't badmouth him?  No, no, no.  I think he likes him, but he's just...  Is there a little kid watching?  Oh, yeah.  The hood's a funny place.  See, this guy's already done.  Like, that's just...  Let children watch.  We had Liddell in one time, and we're like, yes, Kimbo, this guy is great.  And Liddell's like, nah, he's not even that good of a street fighter.  Like, Liddell was so unimpressed with him.  Oh, I know.  Well, it's Liddell.  And then he comes in, and he gets... 
[01:28:30]  He doesn't do too well.  So, I guess he'll go to fucking...  What's the one now?  It's not Affliction.  WWE?  WEC.  It'll be like at a WrestleMania or something, going, I'm Kimbo Slice, motherfucker.  Yeah, what?  Were you fighting?  He's too heavy for WEC.  I forget what's...  Strikeforce.  Strikeforce is probably where he'll end up going, because he makes money.  He's a draw.  People like the same fight.  What's, like, the next one down from UFC?  Like, what's... 
[01:29:00]  I don't know.  There was an IFL for a while.  It was a random, like, kickboxing one, where you had a team.  It was, like, five on five, and, like, you had to...  It was a random thing, and, like, it was different weight classes.  And, like, you had...  It was, like, the Dragons versus the Slayers.  Did you ever hear...  Like, see that?  The IFL?  Wow.  I think it was defunct as of, like, last year, but it...  Yeah.  You know.  They all cropped up for a second.  Because, I mean, UFC is what really kind of took off, and the rest are all second rate.  Yeah.  They got to unify, like, wrestling did.  They need a Vince McMahon type...  Unify.  Just one guy just comes and buys everything out. 
[01:29:30]  Buys everything, and decides to go in the ring and have his ass buffed by people, and...  Hijinks and shenanigans.  Just gets crazy.  So, yeah.  Okay, so he's gone.  We won't be seeing him no more.  Won't be seeing him no more.  Got millions of views on YouTube, and, uh...  Dana's calling in a little later.  Yeah, 915 or something.  We'll get his, uh, always candid view on the whole thing.  I'm always bothering you about Obama.  I know you think Andrew's a big Obama supporter, but he's...  Oh, yeah, I know. 
[01:30:00]  You would think.  You would think I was a big Obama supporter.  Uh, Obama is, uh...  And this reeks of, like...  And I know all the conspiracies about the government slowly taking over, and Obama being a lot more ruthless than he comes across, and the socialist thing, and everything.  But this really does reek of a government that wants a little more control over its people than it's able to get because of things like the internet, and iPhones, and iPads, and, uh, all the places, various places where we get our data these days and our news. 
[01:30:30]  Uh, he, uh, really started lambasting all these, um, the new technology.  Uh, Xbox, um, the things where you can get, you can get news delivered to you.  And we've complained about it a few times because a lot of bloggers and stuff like that write things, and it's taken as news.  Right.  But it's up to the people to sort that out.  There's gonna be dumb dummies that listen to one thing and just blast it out as truth. 
[01:31:00]  We've done it here on this show.  We certainly have.  Some of us have done it on Red Eye.  Yes, exactly.  But, uh, for the most part, you wanna, you wanna kinda get all the angles on, on everything.  But to have the president get up there and, and bash, uh, the latest technology that is giving the people information.  Now, some of it is gonna be knee-jerk.  Some is gonna be very accurate.  Some is gonna be biased. 
[01:31:30]  But you put it all together, you could pretty much get a, a good feel for what's going on.  And you can't, uh, not that he was ever saying taking it away from people, but he was really putting it in a position where it's like,  well, don't pay attention to what people are saying on these things.  What did he say?  Uh, he, he was bashing the, the fact that a lot of misinformation comes out.  And it's because a lot of stuff comes out and it's bad against him and his policies and, and how people don't like it. 
[01:32:00]  And it is a grassroots kind of a thing because it's, it's the people talking amongst each other.  And if they don't like it, they don't like it.  Now, you could obviously blame it on economics and say, well, only rich people, uh, can afford a lot of this technology or poor people can steal it from the rich people.  Uh, so, but, um, uh, so it's automatically going to be biased towards richer, whiter people who are then complaining about him.  But, um, you can't bash a new technology that people are depending on more than your network news, that your CNN, that, uh, is so fucking biased for liberal and Democrats and Obama. 
[01:32:30]  Uh, this is an alternative that a lot of people are using.  And I think him bashing it really, uh, looks bad.  Um, he said he doesn't even know how to use most of these things either, which I think when a president says he doesn't know how to use the latest technology, it, it, it's a little frightening. 
[01:33:00]  They said that especially a young president.  Well, they said Clinton, I think sent one email in his entire presidency.  Loved the blow job.  Yeah, exactly.  I'll clean the dress.  The picture of his cock.  B.C.  I think they said he had sent one email during his entire presidency, because I guess it was just coming around then.  Yeah.  But these guys' technology to Obama to hold an iPad is probably shit when you're on Air Force One and you have a satellite phone and you're like, get everyone in China on the phone.  And you're like, all right, you want a video phone? 
[01:33:30]  This is like a fucking hunk of shit.  But can he get ex-hamster on Air Force One?  Just found out about that one.  That was, where's that been hiding?  You guys have been sitting on that one.  Oh, yeah.  What's your favorite clip?  Like, I'm into the girls wrestling.  That's my thing.  You like that?  Why?  Yeah, I don't know.  I like that.  I like the amateur stuff.  It's great.  I just like watching regular people fuck.  It's fantastic.  Look at that.  And then there's beard rubbing. 
[01:34:00]  You ever see the beard rubbing?  Oh, it's so sexy.  Oh, yeah.  That's, um, yeah.  But you like wrestling?  I like that.  Oh, like that?  I don't get it.  I don't know.  All right.  It's chicks kind of, yeah, wrestling in little bikinis.  Oh, she's got her by the tit.  She's actually feeling her up as she's wrestling.  Her bikini top has come down.  I guess they start out in some type of really skimpy little bra on G-string kind of thing. 
[01:34:30]  And then...  Get to about the three-minute mark and it'll, uh...  They kind of know what they're doing a little bit, though.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  How did they go from wrestling to that other girl eating her ass?  Is that a move?  That's what happens when you lose.  That's pretty sexy.  I never saw Kimbo do that.  You got to pay extra for that package.  Wow.  That is sexy.  She's sucker punching her.  It's over and she's putting her asshole on the other girl's nose.  Wow.  Wow, that's hot.  Yeah, the one girl was laying on her back.  And the other girl, like, kind of crawled on her face. 
[01:35:00]  We're just putting her pussy on the girl's mouth.  Oh, she lost, so she's got to eat her ass.  Or did she win?  That to me, she'd be the...  Now a big dildo going in there.  Wow.  Boy, you found this.  This is ex-hamster.  This is good.  Wow.  This is not traditional wrestling.  No, no.  You see Bob Backlund getting fucking a strap-on.  Oh, my God, King!  She's got the strap-on dildo!  Oh, this is unbelievable!  That's pretty hot.  That is pretty...  I wouldn't have thought...  I wouldn't have thought from you just saying that... 
[01:35:30]  Yeah.  ...that it would have been sexy at all, but...  Yeah, I've got to give it to her.  I saw one of these girls getting off...  Getting out of the train stop in Union Square one day.  Like, it was definitely her, and I almost said something like I'm a big fan.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I think she would probably dug it.  Stop licking your ass.  Yeah.  Throwing it into the platform.  Fucking broken your shin.  Wasn't there something called The Ultimate Competitor?  There was a sign behind it, too.  The Ultimate, uh...  They're trying to do, like, a UFC sign.  Oh, beard porn is pretty sexy.  You'll like this. 
[01:36:00]  This is weird.  No.  Oh, God.  There's, uh...  Eastside Dave and, uh...  Fez.  Beard porn is so...  Fucking creepy.  By the way, yeah.  Beard porn is this thing where guys with beards will rub and nuzzle their beards together.  Now, uh, uh, from the Ron and Fez show, Eastside Dave and Fez Watley decided to make their own.  Oh, this is really them?  Yeah, that's definitely them.  Look, that's Dave.  He's making...  And he's making porno faces. 
[01:36:30]  Oh, funny.  And this started hitting some of the gay websites legitimately.  Really?  How funny is that?  Yeah.  And they wanted it to.  I don't know why you would want to ruin any opportunity you have for a career in anything but this.  Like, you're pretty much just destroying any career.  Beard porn is very...  Oh, it's fucking so...  They get so, like...  You know, sometimes when you scratch a dog the right way, they almost make a face where it's like... 
[01:37:00]  Ah.  I'll just feel his hot breath.  Like, you know, that's what we'll get is the heat.  You would feel the man heat.  And the man heat coming off of their beards.  Oh, God.  I didn't realize that was actually them.  Oh, yeah.  That is...  How could you mistake it?  I thought it was just two guys...  I didn't think that my two friends would be rubbing beards shirtless.  I thought it was like a fucking...  You know, like, hey, these guys look like these two.  Oh, now that's definitely them.  Now, now...  He's kind of laughing.  I guess because Fez is really getting into it. 
[01:37:30]  And there's Dave in some big underwear.  Wow.  He's wearing giant underwear.  He's in better shape than I am.  Do you know how fucking manically depressing that is?  Well, he's laying down.  Once he stands up, it's a world of hurt.  Gravity takes over when he stands up.  And Fez just really creepily crawling up to him.  And then Dave making the funny face again.  And he puts this pleasurable face that he looks right into the camera and starts smiling.  And they're rubbing each other's beards together.  That's fucking horrendous. 
[01:38:00]  Now, did they invent that or they saw that?  No.  Saw it.  Oh, it's some kind of popular...  It's real porn.  I don't know how long it's been going on.  But I'm pretty new to even knowing about this, that this was going on.  Gay guys have just the weirdest shit to get themselves off.  The whole docking thing is just...  That's unbelievable.  Whose foot is that?  Patty's foot porn.  Why is Patty's...  Why are Patty's nails big and long again?  Her toenails.  Did we ever cut them once?  Her feet are fucking elbows. 
[01:38:30]  She has the worst...  Oh!  Oh!  Fez is sucking on her toes!  Ew!  Is that...  Oh, my God.  Looks like a tailbone.  She has hammer toes that should be hit with a hammer.  I know.  In her face.  She has hammer face.  Get me a lump hammer.  If you want to play foot porn and beard porn at home, it's 202friends on Twitter.  202friends on Twitter.  That's fucking disgusting. 
[01:39:00]  Her toenails are like Nosferatu's fingers.  They are horrible.  And why is Fezzy licking it?  And he's really getting into it.  It looks like she's forced to wear shoes that are way too small for her.  Yeah.  She probably is.  Her feet look like that one Tetris piece that never...  You know, that's just a weird...  I don't know why that's really hard to fit with the little thing coming out of it.  I don't know how to spin it.  Oh, wow. 
[01:39:30]  Dave's making it like he's jerking off.  They sure do put out some funny videos.  It's disgusting.  He won't stop.  He won't stop.  You know how they got a reek that's dirty underneath her toenails and he's sucking on them?  Look at how filthy her fucking toenails are.  God damn it.  That's fucking rude.  They probably smell really bad.  Oh.  Ron and Fez put out some good stuff.  Yeah.  They really don't have any inhibitions over there.  No.  To do anything. 
[01:40:00]  That's why I do love that show.  God damn.  I listen on my way home.  Very fun.  Ron and Fez after our program here on XM202.  Sirius 193 or something like that.  I have no idea.  197?  I don't know.  What's on 193?  Because I listen to that expecting us and I haven't heard it.  It's not us.  97.  I don't even listen.  They allow you one radio now.  I pay for my own accounts.  Sirius 197, XM202.  Silly company.  I'm a goddamn personality here and I'm allowed one radio and I don't even know which one that is. 
[01:40:30]  I paid for every radio.  My friends, family, everything.  They're like, hey, you think you're going to hook me up?  And then I look like an asshole if I say no.  So yeah.  And then I just look at my Amex and it's like Sirius XM, Sirius XM, Sirius XM.  I'm paying for radios up the asshole.  Unbelievable.  XM, they were tossing them at you.  Yeah.  Who the fuck did you know?  Did you fuck her?  Did you fuck her?  Yeah.  Here's a radio.  Which, of course, is a lot less than that she should have gotten. 
[01:41:00]  A little more stretching.  The girls are wrestling now.  And we're watching them bend over.  I love watching a girl bend over in wrestling trunks with her fucking vag sticking out.  The beginning of this, they're stretching and kind of bending.  It almost reminds me of that old Showtime thing where they put the girls on the turntable to do the exercises.  When Showtime first came out, first really got popular.  When they had Lady Chatterley.  Yeah, and in between those movies, because, I don't know, they must have had one fucking big VCR, and it took them a while to change tapes.  So they would put on these girls, and under the guise of exercise, it was pretty smutty. 
[01:41:30]  It was girls on this turntable thing, and there were like three or four of them, and they would do these bending exercises,  and the camera would, just for a second, get one bending over, and you'd see a little lip.  And then they'd go back to their faces smiling.  That's hot.  Oh, yeah, it was.  It was extremely hot.  Jerk-off-able.  It was jerk-off-to-able back then.  I love when a pussy lip flops out. 
[01:42:00]  Isn't that great?  When her panties pull aside, it comes out like a fucking elephant ear.  Indian or African?  That's the big difference.  If it's an African elephant, wow.  Yeah, I'd say the big one.  Which is smaller, the Indian?  Yeah, Indian.  Oh, look, she's got her pin, and she's fucking...  Oh, my God, she's...  I think that girl's losing.  Yeah.  The girl, she's got her on the floor, and she's sticking a fist up her ass or something.  Oh, a nice reversal, though.  This is great. 
[01:42:30]  Boy, this...  I never thought about this.  How have you guys not been on this?  Thank you.  This has been two years for me.  Wow.  When do you start...  Two years?  You've been on this one for two years?  I'm teaching a community college course on this.  When do you start jerking off?  Like, as the clip starts, or do they have to be naked first?  Nude.  I have to watch a couple first, and then, like, the third one.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  So you'll go through two of these just like this?  This is on the road in Davenport.  This is it right here.  Ultimate Surrender, it's called.  Ooh.  Now she's throat-fucking her with an orange strap-on. 
[01:43:00]  Strap-on.  Oh, now she's ass-fucking her with a strap-on.  Wow, that is amazing.  Okay.  Wow, that's...  She's good.  She's got good technique.  Much better fuck than I am, this chick.  Yeah.  Oh, that girl's asshole's nice and rusty.  I love a good rusty anus.  That's not my...  Like, I almost won't watch the porn if the asshole is, like, discolored like that.  Yeah, you need, like, a same skin tone asshole.  Yeah, I need the bleaching.  No!  I like a dark, deep asshole.  Do you?  Yes. 
[01:43:30]  I really do.  I like a sinkhole, hiney.  I want it to look like some fucking dad just fell in with his lawnmower in the yard.  I love a sinkhole anus.  Look at those awful fake tits.  Those are terrible.  Yeah, naturals are always, always better.  It seems like naturals made a nice little comeback in the last couple years.  I don't really feel like guys are chasing the fake tits like that anymore.  Naturals did, and much to Jimmy's chagrin,  which I know you're not a fan of,  pubes are making a comeback.  Not entirely. 
[01:44:00]  Not the old school 70s Earth Mama Muff pubes.  Yeah.  But a little line, maybe a little triangle,  some type of hair there,  not just the complete shaving,  is kind of making a little bit of a comeback.  You seem like a complete shaved dude.  No, I was.  I know he's a no hair yet dude.  I go through,  I go,  I'm a trend guy,  so, you know,  the shaved thing was good,  but now I'm kind of digging like,  yeah, I like a little there. 
[01:44:30]  Light dusting?  It lets me know where I am,  what's going on,  and reminds me of what's supposed to,  you know, be there.  What it's pointing to.  Hey,  eat here,  like a diner's time.  You've been driving for miles.  It's,  yeah,  I like a little bit.  If it's not,  I don't want a forest,  I don't want to be going,  but,  you know,  a little something.  See,  I could work with the forest.  I could definitely work with the forest.  Yes.  Yeah.  You like the big one?  You don't like the shaved? 
[01:45:00]  All day.  No,  that's like a,  like a,  like a little girl.  No,  it's not.  I'm a grown woman.  I mean,  yeah.  And I actually thought about you,  I've been at a high school for two months,  I did a,  MTV made.  Your 21 Jump Street agent.  It really was.  I was like,  clearly the narc cop.  Like,  you guys know where I get some angel dust?  Asking for old shit.  No,  I smoke.  Hey,  don't smoke that potty here.  It's got paraquat on it.  Paraquat?  What year is it?  But yeah,  man,  there were young girls in that high school.  Cause I'm not a young girl guy.  That's what high school is. 
[01:45:30]  But I just,  I was like,  there are some fucking cute girls.  What's an MTV made?  You know where like the kid wants to be.  Yeah.  It's like a girl.  She's like a fat girl.  She wants to be a pageant queen.  She a leader.  So they'll hire like a coach to come in.  And like,  like my kid wanted to be a comedian and he went to meet chicks.  And he was the best.  That goes hand in hand.  he had,  um,  no,  it means he wants to be a comedian or meet chicks.  It should be one or the other.  Yeah.  And he had,  uh,  he had Asperger's,  uh, 
[01:46:00]  syndrome,  which was,  it was crazy though,  because I don't know.  Dumb name for a disease,  by the way.  It's like,  it makes it even worse.  It's even more of an Asperger's.  Asperger's.  So what,  he doesn't have to behave socially.  Yeah.  That's basically what it was.  He was just like,  he wasn't,  he was like a big grownup little kid,  but he wanted chicks though,  which is weird.  Isn't that almost a type of autism?  Yeah.  They say it's on the scale.  It's like on the autism spectrum or whatever.  But he did,  I mean,  what it did do is like,  I don't know if you know anybody that's got that shit.  He has,  I don't know anybody that doesn't.  You, 
[01:46:30]  and if you think about it,  like when you meet somebody like him,  you're like my next door neighbor 20 years ago had this shit.  You know what I'm saying?  Like there was just no diagnosis.  They just called him an idiot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fucking idiot.  It was just like,  don't talk to him.  Yeah.  There's a retard next door.  That's exactly what he just stays in the back room and watches Wapner.  So yeah,  I mean,  but he was like,  he really had,  I think just because of his,  syndrome,  he just had that disconnect where he just had chrome plated balls,  dude.  Anything I would,  I'd be like,  go talk to that chick.  He would be right over there.  All right.  No fucking barrier. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  He didn't have that.  So what's Asperger's then?  What would he do that's inappropriate?  It's like,  it's not even inappropriate.  He just kind of like,  wouldn't like a perfect example.  Like when we wrapped the show,  our last,  our last scene,  you know,  he's going to go meet his date and go get in the limo and take off.  So I'm like,  this is our last time on camera together.  I'm like,  yo,  just compliment her.  Don't,  you know,  give her a kiss on the cheek,  get in the limo.  So he's like,  I got it.  I got this.  So he goes on the,  on the porch,  meets the girl's parents and looks at the girl and goes,  good evening.  You look relatively nice tonight. 
[01:47:30]  It was beautiful because he just didn't know what relatively meant.  You know,  I think he meant like indubitably,  like,  so he thought it was like a big word to use.  Relatively.  You look relatively nice tonight,  but it was like such a beautiful thing.  Cause he's always going to mess up,  but he's such a lovable kid.  You know what I'm saying?  He was a great kid,  man.  How'd he do a standup?  It was,  I'll tell you like this.  When you,  when you see it,  he fucking killed.  Really?  Legitimately.  I thought like the, 
[01:48:00]  you know,  the show is going to be like,  all right guys,  clap it up when he gets up there.  They didn't tell them shit.  So he just went up as a 16 year old kid with,  I mean,  his material was whatever.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But you know,  he just got up there.  The crowd loved him,  man.  He fucking did great,  man.  And I think they wanted him to bomb.  Cause you know,  they want him to have the,  the downtime,  but yeah,  he fucking killed man.  So what was his thing?  If he had Asperger's and it's like this,  he's comfortable,  breast ball.  What did they need a coach for?  He needed a coach because he didn't like literally,  man,  he didn't know how to dress himself.  Literally, 
[01:48:30]  like literally,  like he'd just have on like mom jeans,  you know,  at 16,  like he'd have on like wranglers and like just a shitty t-shirt.  And I'm like,  dude,  this is not gonna,  this is 2010,  bro.  You know?  So like I had to get his head together.  Like I just like,  he wasn't washing his hair,  dog.  You know what I'm saying?  There's like baseline shit.  You know what I'm saying?  You're a better coach than I am.  I would be like,  look dude,  this whole shower thing,  forget it.  Women like men in skirts.  Smelly men in skirts. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  They're wonderful.  But it shows you how natural that drive is for a man to just want to get  pussy.  No matter what you have.  With all these barriers,  he was just like,  I don't know how,  but I want that.  I don't know how to get that.  So,  yeah,  you know,  he came around though,  man,  got himself a girl over and give her ass burgers.  Yeah.  Maybe put some ass pickles or onions or something.  Chip.  I love Chip.  I don't love for Chip like I do. 
[01:49:30]  Have you met Chip before?  I've heard Chip.  I've never met Chip.  Chip's awful.  I think,  I don't know.  I think the last one I met was Uncle Paul.  I definitely met him straight up.  Oh yeah,  I remember I was rubbing your skin saying it was like a Hershey kiss.  So gentle.  So you,  so this,  who was the girl?  Did he,  was this a high school chick?  Yeah,  this was a high school chick.  And it's funny because he was,  he was straight up doing what I think every guy does when they're 16.  He was going after like the 5'11 blonde hair, 
[01:50:00]  blue eyed,  like chick that's already probably banging a college football player.  And you're like,  dude,  we need to stay in our lane.  Yeah.  You know what I'm saying?  And the girl,  the girl at the end of the,  at the end of the show is our lane,  dude.  She's like precious.  Yeah.  Is it bad?  Cause I won't watch that movie.  Am I like a sellout to my race?  No,  go ahead.  It is the funniest fucking,  when she gets,  it's like watching an old Warner brothers cartoon.  When fucking Monique wells a potted plant at the back of her head.  I expect you like, 
[01:50:30]  bam.  Like you expect to hear.  You know,  it's like,  ah,  Oh,  you darn rabbit.  You hit me again.  She is just a fat.  So getting nailed.  See,  and you'll probably remember,  I thought you were going to reference like,  you remember like on those old Tom and Jerry's,  like they would never show her face,  but there'd be that black mammy.  Oh yeah.  And they still used to show them.  Yeah.  It'd be like 1995.  It'd be like the black man.  Now you,  you'd see,  you'd see like a foot tapping.  Yeah.  Like all pissed with a black leg.  Yeah.  And a big fat black hand with a big white palm would point at him and go, 
[01:51:00]  now you get out the house before I kick your,  it's like,  that was a mammy.  Oh,  it was a mammy in the house.  It was a disputable mammy.  Oh yeah.  I call those the good old days.  How come you won't watch the movie?  I feel like I,  I feel like I won't be able to eat after that.  No.  Like she's disgusting.  She really is.  I don't want to see her.  When she's running with that fucking bucket of chicken.  Dude,  I,  I nearly pissed myself. 
[01:51:30]  It was good though.  I like,  I,  Monique was fantastic.  It's worth seeing just for her.  Monique's that good?  Phenomenal.  I heard she stunk on Saturday Night Live.  Monique?  Gabrielle.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She was terrible.  Yeah,  she was.  Monique was fucking really good in that.  She deserved the Oscar.  But you know what,  you know what gets me?  I,  I watch it thinking,  all right,  that's the real Monique though.  Yeah.  Like the fake Monique is the one you see Showtime at the Apollo.  Hey everybody,  woo woo,  we're going to have some fun.  Like that is the one she puts on for TV.  And then the real Monique is,  hey motherfucker. 
[01:52:00]  You know,  she's like the pissed off bitch.  There's a great scene with Monique where she's dancing.  Remember she's dancing in the mirror trying to get herself sexy.  Oh yeah.  And she's like smoking and dry.  And she looks fucking,  she's like maybe a two after she gets dressed up.  A disaster.  But it was a great,  like that's,  that's what this woman is like.  Like that's her idea of getting attractive is just dancing in the fucking mirror.  And she's horrible looking.  And I actually thought Mariah Carey was really good too.  Going in there with no makeup on and just kind of sitting there and being the social worker. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah,  it was,  yeah.  I just,  and I'm not just saying this because it's supposed to be a sensitive movie and,  and I'm supposed to be the guy that doesn't like this sensitive movie.  There were parts that were really good.  Like,  wow,  that's fucking some heavy shit,  you know,  to lay on somebody.  But,  I swear to you,  I found a lot of that movie funny.  Just fucking funny.  When she throws that goddamn TV at her,  Yeah.  with the kid down the fucking thing,  I'm laughing. 
[01:53:00]  Going this bitch out of her fucking mind.  Did you like the part where she said,  come in here and help mommy?  Oh yeah.  She made her go in there and eat her pussy.  Yeah.  Oh shit.  Help her out,  yeah.  It's not sexy,  look at her.  No.  It's not sexy.  Oh my god.  That is,  now,  now,  and have we found one black girl that you would bang?  Like a dark skinned one?  I still haven't found one yet.  Like,  I think in the,  I think I was a lot more tolerant and open to it when I was younger than I am now,  because like,  and I mentioned 21 Jump Street,  what's her name there?  Holly Robinson.  Holly Robinson.  She was like the hot black chick of her time. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah,  she definitely was.  And then,  you look back at what,  what the hot black chick that white people accepted was years ago,  and they've changed over the years.  It was her and Ray Dong Chong.  All right.  Ray Dong Chong was hot.  And she was,  she was half a China girl.  Yeah.  So,  who the hell knows?  But nowadays,  I'm not really finding,  uh,  any,  any black girls really,  you know.  Who's that?  That's Holly Robinson now.  It's a little long,  but I fucking.  Get her,  get her in like 21 Jump Street days,  you fucking nut. 
[01:54:00]  What are you doing?  She's 53.  You pull up a fucking old ass picture of her?  Jimmy Robinson from Lost in Space.  That might as well be.  That was the one I liked.  Jesus.  Come on,  give me some fucking,  yeah,  that's what I'm talking about.  Was Johnny Depp on that show?  Yeah,  that kind of,  wow.  He made his bones there.  He hated it though.  Like,  he,  he did the show for a year and then wanted out.  Why?  Because he didn't want to be that sex symbol,  the kind of 16 magazine guy.  He wanted to actually do act,  be an actor.  Wow. 
[01:54:30]  And then what's his name?  Fucking,  who was it?  Who was the fat kid there?  He was the son of,  fuck.  All right.  I never,  the son of Mr.  Mrs.  Nagel.  It'll come up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I never saw that show.  Peter DeLuise.  Thank you.  That's Dom DeLuise's son.  Ah,  I wonder if he sucked a cock like Dom did.  I bet you Dom just,  I bet you Dom didn't even have sex with the woman.  I bet you he just came in his hand  and threw it in and yelled,  yuck.  Fucking handed it out the door.  You know,  see,  she wasn't bad there.  She was cute right there. 
[01:55:00]  And then,  you know who else wasn't bad?  The daughter from the first Lethal Weapon movie.  Oh yeah.  Very pretty.  She was definitely doable.  Was that Stacey Dash?  She was also the daughter in Moving.  Remember Richard Pryor's Moving?  Not a great film.  No.  I don't know if that was her.  No,  don't get,  get the other one.  Now,  now Ann,  what do you think about Stacey right here?  Right there?  I was,  oh shit,  wait a minute,  is that her?  Yeah.  Ah,  fuck it.  That's the girl,  that's the daughter from Moving.  Nail her in a second. 
[01:55:30]  Where's the Lethal Weapon?  She was very pretty,  but she wasn't as hot by the third one.  No,  that is her.  Yeah,  that's Lethal Weapon,  right?  Uh,  no.  Put in some Lethal Weapon daughter.  That's all you gotta know.  Lena Horne died.  When did she die?  Lena Horne.  Oh,  92,  she just died.  92 years old?  She had a lot of white features.  Yeah.  She had a pointy nose,  little thin lips.  She definitely crossed over,  yeah.  She was hot back in the fucking old days,  right?  Yeah,  she was really hot.  Yeah.  Is that her?  Yeah?  It's a different girl, 
[01:56:00]  I'm telling you.  Yeah?  Oh,  come on.  I mean love.  No,  but Murtaugh,  was that,  what's the name's last name?  Yeah,  Murtaugh.  Murtaugh,  sorry.  It's gotta be Murtaugh.  Yeah.  Motherfucker.  Let me see if she was born in 38.  That's the wife.  That's the wife,  Jesus Christ.  Rianne,  Tracy Wolf is the girl's name.  Ria?  Let's see.  Pop,  pop that bitch up.  Yeah,  she was cute.  Let me see a picture,  motherfucker.  What the hell?  No pictures of her?  She did one movie? 
[01:56:30]  No.  When was she born?  Yeah,  that chick is barely black.  Yeah,  that's her.  Is that her?  That's her now.  I don't want her now.  God.  Sam.  Little weapon?  It's white clink.  Oh,  you are no Danny Ross.  He's punching in Mr. Wolf.  Fucking Harvey Keitelist.  Yeah.  God damn,  man.  You are a boob.  Not many pictures of her, 
[01:57:00]  but,  but yeah,  yeah,  that like that.  I guess I would have fucked a black chick back in the 80s.  That seems to be what's happening.  I'm going to find one for you.  Yeah,  you're going to find one?  I'll figure it out and find one.  I'm going to find one.  I have plenty of black chicks.  My white chicks are what I like the best,  but I would fuck a black girl.  I wouldn't care.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I just got to find one that I would have found attractive.  Like,  I can't have them too sister-y.  It's too intimidating for me.  You best fuck me,  man.  Now,  what about this one?  She's pretty hot.  I'd fuck Francine. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah,  Francine's always been on the list.  I'd fuck Francine.  She's getting a little long in the tooth now,  though.  Is she really?  She's getting a little bit of this.  She's been on the show for a while.  She's getting a little bit of this.  Like,  like the ass,  if you look at it from the front,  it started like this,  and then it starts doing this.  Anthony's saying it's getting a little lumpy.  Like,  like,  no,  you get that secretary spread thing going.  You know.  Mom butt.  She's developing.  Yeah,  she's still got,  you know,  maybe another couple of years of fuckability,  but,  I don't know.  Who's that,  Danny?  I've never seen a picture of Francine.  No,  Francine either takes really cute pictures 
[01:58:00]  or horrid pictures.  Yeah,  Francine's sexy,  though.  There's something about Francine that's sexy.  Oh,  yes,  the ass and vagina.  I'd have fucked that Keisha Knight Pulliam  back in the Cosby days.  I liked her little mustache.  Did she have a mustache?  Of course she did.  Did she?  No,  she ended up turning,  she ended up turning out not bad.  Like,  big set of tits on her and shit.  Yeah.  But,  um,  look at how you're spelling it.  Keychain Cosby show.  You just spelled Keychain Cosby show.  What dumb Sam does is he puts in the first couple letters 
[01:58:30]  and hopes that Google suggests it properly.  Yeah,  dude,  look at her.  Wow.  she has great tits.  Her fucking head's a little big,  though.  She has a big head.  She has tranny hips,  too.  God damn it.  Good call.  She does.  Tranny hips?  Yeah.  Tranny hips.  You just made her more sexy to Jim.  No one,  let me,  let me,  let me,  let me.  Does she have tranny cock?  Let me say that.  Nobody understands tranny hip references unless they've fucked a couple of trannies.  Nobody makes that reference. 
[01:59:00]  I'll tell you what it is.  It was living on Miami Beach,  man.  Like,  I lived in Miami for years,  and dude,  you can,  I mean,  at about two,  they just catch that lead out of just drunk frat guys wandering around some kind of hot chick.  It's like,  hey,  and he's like,  hey,  this chick.  Yeah,  I'm like,  yeah,  you head on over there.  Good one.  God damn,  man.  So who's this we're looking at,  Samuel?  Oh,  and that up there is Francine right there.  That's not Francine in the fucking bathing suit?  Yeah.  That's her?  Danny?  Oh my God.  Danny just lost the picture.  I never saw that fucking shot. 
[01:59:30]  Danny just lost the picture.  Oh.  Oh my God.  The monitor came disconnected,  of course.  You are no Sam Roberts.  Oh,  wait a minute.  How old is that picture?  That's probably a few years.  It's probably a few years.  She looks good there.  Yeah.  She looks ridiculously lost on the beach,  though.  She has no idea.  She thinks she's looking at the ocean.  I know.  She's actually facing the fucking beach.  She has no idea.  She does look confused,  like they just took her off the boat.  What am I supposed to do?  Francine, 
[02:00:00]  you should look sexy at the beach.  She had her hands on her hips.  I know.  She has no clue.  Jesus.  Very out of place at the beach.  Yeah.  She's in ankle deep water drowning.  Yeah.  She's a fucking fool.  Who do I want to touch her hiney?  That's a good shot of her,  too.  Yeah.  Yeah,  see,  she is.  Not bad.  I like that fucking Tina Turner wig she has on.  That hairdo is horrible.  Yeah,  I think she finally aced that thing.  I think she finally threw that away,  or it crawled away one night.  A lot of black women throw me with the wigs.  I can't do the wigs.  I just rather your natural hair, 
[02:00:30]  even if it doesn't look great,  the wig,  I'm just like,  come on.  You don't like Francine's Sammy Hagar wig?  That's exactly what I want.  My IQ is 55.  See,  she's an idiot.  Oh boy,  is she.  You don't like black girl wigs at all?  No,  man,  I can't get into it,  man.  I'd rather you just go,  even if you went with the short,  short,  short,  like even my,  rather that than just the fake wig.  It looks ridiculous.  Like Dak's girlfriend in school days.  Yeah.  Whoever played Larry Fishburne's girlfriend, 
[02:01:00]  she was black and she was dark,  and she had like very,  very short hair.  She was fucking really sexy too.  I don't know her actress's name.  It works as long as it's not just that little afro thing going on.  Like,  I don't know.  I can do the hair extensions,  but when I see a wig,  I'm just like,  like you just picture the pins underneath there,  holding it down.  Little fucking circles of hair with the pins through them.  Yeah.  Just greasy and sweaty underneath that.  Yeah,  and when black women go out and get the blonde wigs,  I'm like,  what are you doing?  What are you doing? 
[02:01:30]  Who's that?  She looks good though.  Yeah,  I don't like that shit.  Little paw prints on her tits.  Small animal walked through shit and then crawled on her.  Why would you have paw prints on your tits?  It just looked like a duty cat stepped on you.  Yo,  speaking of cats,  man,  I'm leaving my friend's house yesterday.  His cat fucking,  I have my bag with me coming to New York.  His cat fucking pissed in my fucking bag.  It must have zipped it back shut.  I mean,  I'm in the,  I'm in LaGuardia yesterday.  I'm like,  who the fuck is smelling like that? 
[02:02:00]  Yeah,  like a homeless.  Dude,  I got near my,  I mean,  all my clothes,  cat piss,  dude,  and you can't get rid of cat piss.  It's done.  It's done.  Throw it out.  It's done.  How annoyed are you?  I just,  just because I,  I know that I was probably stinking at the bar.  You know,  I had a beer.  I'm like the cool guy like,  I'm waiting on my flight.  I'm just cat piss.  And people would come about like,  what the fuck is a cat piss?  Homeless guy.  Who's fucking,  are you drinking beer and just pissing yourself here?  That shit is unbelievable.  I had a,  when I was living with Melinda, 
[02:02:30]  she wanted a cat really bad.  I want a cat.  I want a cat.  I want a cat.  And given Anthony gave in and got a cat,  which promptly clawed my $4,000 living room rug.  Immediately.  Which now resides underneath my Mustang in the garage.  That's great.  Cause it's just all the pile got pulled up,  had 8,000 cat toys everywhere.  And we just fuck with the $4,000.  I was like so pissed. 
[02:03:00]  But initially she wants a cat,  comes back with two fucking cats.  Now I'm like,  well,  two is just as easy as one.  He's still got to clean a litter box and feed and stuff.  I'm like,  so I go,  I go,  I was so pissed off.  I go to bed.  I lay down and I'm like,  I smell cat piss.  She goes,  oh,  it's your mansion.  You just don't like the cats.  Blah,  blah,  blah.  I'm like,  no,  I smell cat piss.  The cat had pissed right where my head goes on my mattress. 
[02:03:30]  You think that wasn't a passive aggressive?  Oh,  sure.  Yeah.  That is a,  an absolute go fuck yourself.  This is my house now,  bitch.  You know where that cat went?  Right.  The fuck out.  Get out.  How'd that go?  I said,  find someone.  It was girlfriend.  Oh shit.  Yeah.  Well,  it was,  it was give it to one of your friends.  That cat is out.  So we kept the one cat that clawed up my,  uh,  my carpet.  This cat has gotten 26 million YouTube.  Dude, 
[02:04:00]  this is the funny,  turn the volume up on this fucking cat.  This is the,  it called very angry cat.  Which one was it?  It is so pissed.  Listen to it.  Ears are back.  That cat is pissed.  Like what the fuck were they doing? 
[02:04:30]  It didn't like being in that cage.  You got to put that,  you can't give that cat away.  You got to put it down,  right?  No,  that cat's got to be shot with a 38.  Fuck it.  You can't even get it to put the blue fluid through its veins.  Lull it to sleep.  And it was in my arms and I was petting it when its life went out of it.  It was very beautiful moment at the vet's office.  That cat.  Blam.  It's an angry dog chasing a tail in a circle.  Very angry at it too.  He's got the,  he's got that fucking showing its teeth shit.  The best one. 
[02:05:00]  Have you seen the video of the dog?  His,  his leg starts twitching and then he thinks it's like some other dog trying to get it.  And starts growling at it.  He starts growling and attacking its own foot.  Why do they do that?  Dogs are so stupid.  I like when people are like,  no,  this dog is really smart and stuff.  And then you see him doing shit like that and just go,  no,  that's why they don't have the divine spark of humanity and opposable thumbs.  They're stupid.  My dog is really smart as it eats its own shit off the rug.  As it greets everybody by licking their balls.  It thinks its foot is trying to steal its bone and it's yelling at its foot. 
[02:05:30]  Its leg is creeping up and it doesn't know it.  It's its own leg.  It's pissed at its own foot.  And there's a laugh track.  Like obviously an animal is just trying to kill itself and people are enjoying it.  That's why you can't have kids around animals though,  though.  That kind of shit.  Yeah.  Imagine if that was a kid just crawling around wanting to play with the little doggy bone. 
[02:06:00]  That's where you get the,  you know,  the person that's 30 years old going,  well,  when I was a child,  we had a dog when I was six years old.  It's got half a face.  Apparently you got to watch out because dogs really like the smell of,  like the way piss smells in a diaper.  Like there's something about that.  So does Uncle Paul.  Sometimes you can smell it in the elevator when you're coming up. 
[02:06:30]  So you got to be careful.  Yeah.  Well,  they'll attack those genitals,  man.  My buddy's a doctor and he said he had to do like reconstructive surgery when he was a resident  because like some like,  wow.  One of those hot dog dogs too,  the non-aggressive ones.  Yeah.  They just,  he just goes in the diaper and fucking chewed this kid's dick off.  The kid was like fucking six months old,  man.  And you already got to fucking have the,  what are we going to,  how are we going to raise him conversation?  What are we going to do?  Because your fucking stupid beagle bit his dick off and chewed it up.  Do you just give it a sex change and then not tell it?  They try that,  but then you're like,  well,  why do I like, 
[02:07:00]  you know,  that shit doesn't work.  You can't tell somebody that they like,  you know,  then you just go,  yeah,  you're a lesbian.  You can't just build a pussy on something.  Sorry.  You're a lesbian.  I think at that age you could.  That's a very cute kitten.  All right.  Now you're,  now you're just putting adorable,  adorable kitten footage out.  A little kitten attacking some guy's hand and then spreading out their paws when he pulls his hand back.  All right.  Kittens are very cute.  Who does that love a kitten?  Turn into pissing fucking clawing your rug thing.  Here's the rule.  I play with a kitten until it's six months and then I put it down at the garbage disposal and I get a new one. 
[02:07:30]  I'm taking any shit from kittens.  What is that thing?  It's a baby jaguar.  Why would you have a baby jaguar?  Isn't that illegal?  Yeah.  It's playing with a little mechanical mouse that somebody's driving around the floor.  You're not allowed to have that.  Maybe it's Siegfried and Roy.  Oh, Christ.  That little mechanical gerbil would be driving up their asses.  He's got a clothespin on his little mechanical nose because the German put it in his hiney. 
[02:08:00]  I got to piss too.  Can we break?  I got to take a leak.  Yeah, let's take a little leaky break and we'll be back and talk about all kinds of other great shit.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.'s.  You have eight new voice messages.  First voice message.

You're a pretty, uh, uh, uh, uh, I fucking hate that fucking thing. 
[02:10:00]  Sweet end of new messages.  Call the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Thank you and goodbye.  And now, now, the Opie and Anthony show on the virus.  Serious like that.  Detachable penis.  This is a big song on, uh, lithium. 
[02:10:30]  What's it called?  Detachable penis.  Yeah, it's a little story about a guy who, uh, wanted a detachable penis.  And, uh, he, he had one.  And, uh, he, he lost it.  And then, uh, he finds it at a book kiosk.  And he, he bought it back from the guy.  And put it back on.  And then people kind of ask him if he's sad that he has a detachable penis.  And, uh, he goes, you know, sometimes we're getting lost like that as a bitch. 
[02:11:00]  But he would never give up his detachable penis.  That's a song?  That's this song.  Yeah.  It's horrendous.  Yeah, of course it is.  It's in the 90s.  What do you expect?  I guess we should announce, uh, Al Jackson is, uh, in studio with us.  Let me just plug Al's gig.  He's at the Comedy Factory in Baltimore.  Thursday, May through, 13th through Saturday, May 15th.  Baltimorecomedy.com.  A lot of you guys have seen Al with me.  He's a very funny comic.  And, uh, Big A will be at the Friday Night Show.  Oh, Jesus. 
[02:11:30]  Representing.  Yes.  He'll be in rows three through seven.  I love for Big A.  It's my boy.  Big A.  And Andy Levy from Red Eye, which I will be on tonight, is also here.  Oh.  Hello.  Thank you by that.  I am promoting my new iPhone app.  Yes, I purchased it.  Uh, like I said, I was on the shitter the other day.  And I went through, uh, and I put in Jim Norton in the search.  Your app popped right up.  And for a bargain price of 99 cents, if it was a buck, I would have said, fuck it. 
[02:12:00]  99 cents is easy.  Uh, I, uh, downloaded it.  And I was listening to all your fun little sounds as I was on the toilet.  Heh.  You know, you got that.  It's great.  And all Jimmy's dates on there.  Uh, your gig dates.  Uh, ringtones.  A lot of ringtones.  All kinds of ringtones.  I was only kidding, Andy.  They're not going to be promoting that on the Red Eye.  I was just whoring myself, as I usually do.  Yes.  Well, we can, we can promote it if you really want us to.  Oh, I don't know. 
[02:12:30]  Hey, Anthony, I just want to, by the way, thank you for explaining what that song was about.  Because the fact that it was called Detachable Penis, and you basically said exactly what  the lyrics were, really, it was really helpful for America, I think.  Say what the lyrics were.  What a waste of fucking time that was.  Jesus.  That was just for Jimmy Norton, though, who does not know one song past 1974.  I really don't.  So, I was just helping him out.  If Kiss did it, he might have known it.  Or Ozzy.  Hey, Jim, can I just give you a buck and not download this thing? 
[02:13:00]  Hey, pick up the phone.  It's Uncle Paul.  Say your...  Slip my hands into your underpants.  Now, who wouldn't want to be on a crowded train and have that pop on?  Of course you would.  Of course you would.  What'd you do to your little paw?  I have torn cartilage in my wrist, and it acts up every once in a while, and it's  the last couple days been pretty bad.  It's just been forever like that?  I've had it for like four or five years.  I don't know if it's still...  Is there a reason? 
[02:13:30]  Don't you need a reason for that?  Shit just comes back like that?  Well, no, I tore it.  It needs to...  I need surgery.  Ooh.  How'd you tear it in your right hand?  I'm not really sure, actually.  You are.  I'm left-handed.  So that could be...  Thanks, Jim, for not being a hack.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  Because I've never heard that before.  You haven't?  Jesus, you're a professional comedian.  That's where you went?  Oh, literal, Jim.  I know.  Right to the...  But it was actually not even...  But it really was a logic...  Right to the fisting another man joke.  I wasn't going there.  Oh, then this was the first time. 
[02:14:00]  Okay.  I was implying you were doing one-arm push-ups.  Yes.  How did you hurt it?  I'm honestly not really sure.  He does not know.  That's the worst thing, though, is hurting it.  Especially...  We were just talking about working out.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  And you just don't want to hurt yourself.  And I notice you wake up hurting after you work out.  And when you're a kid and you're out just running around like an idiot, you never ache  to the next day. 
[02:14:30]  It just didn't happen.  Yeah, that's when you're in the best shape of your life is when you're like 13.  Everybody's like, oh, I was 22.  I was fit.  No, it's like when you're 13.  You could fucking break your arm and it's back in four weeks.  You didn't have to move like bricks at 13 and do jobs like that.  You'd ride your stupid bike and dream about having sex.  Now it's, you know, you're just in utter pain all the time.  Especially after the sex.  Yes, of course.  Sure, you have to pull your little pants up, get the gravel out of your knees.  Hope the older boy doesn't tell people what he's just done to you. 
[02:15:00]  And then you hurt yourself reaching for your wallet after.  It's just...  I didn't pay for prostitutes at 13.  My first hooker, I was 21.  21?  Yeah, 21 years old.  Wow, you waited quite a while.  I sure did.  I just went up and she had like missing teeth.  She was fucking, she was maybe a three.  Why did you wait so long?  I don't know.  I didn't get my license until I was 21.  I didn't walk around Commercial Avenue, fucking wave at them.  Was like the second you got your license, were you cruising?  Dude, you know, I can't tell you. 
[02:15:30]  I think from DMV.  You got an STD.  Well, shit, HIV.  Then I LOL.  Yeah, it's, well, 21.  I would have had you pegged for a little earlier, but it makes sense.  Like, what are you going to do when you're, if you don't have a vehicle, you do kind of  look silly, just going, hey, sweetheart.  No, I was actually 19 when I got my license and I waited a couple years.  I just didn't realize that walk around prostitutes were so easy to get.  Yeah?  Yeah, I didn't know how fucking simple it was just to ride down and talk to them. 
[02:16:00]  Were you getting any, like, before that, were you getting any just regular girls?  No.  No.  Occasionally.  Yeah.  I used to go after sober dances.  I would ride around and look at the prostitutes because I was so depressed.  I'd go to a sober dance and strike out with the girls and fucking go look at hookers and  pick them up.  I'd want to flask with you.  One girl.  Give her a little booze.  You know she's out of control.  You know why she's at a sober dance.  She fucked any time she drank.  Well, this girl seems to be doing well.  And all of a sudden, five minutes later, she's running around the dance.  Give me some cock.  Sorry, honey. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah, it had to happen.  It was always such a production, like, at least for me.  I know some guys had game and stuff growing up and going through high school and shit like  that.  But I used to have to put in a commitment that was months in the making.  Like, I needed a relationship before I could fuck a girl.  It was like going out and dating and driving around and dropping her off and jerking off.  And then, like, after two months, if I was lucky, it would be a situation where I was 
[02:17:00]  able to take her somewhere where we had some time and a bed and, you know, shit like that.  But it was like one of those commitments.  And I always envied the guys that were just able to get a girl that night, bang them,  and that was it.  I'm just hoping that changes for me someday.  Yeah?  Are you still like that guy?  Yeah.  Were you like, which kind of guy were you?  Were you the fuck the girl and take a high school?  Back in high school?  Yeah.  Oh, I was the neither of those guys.  Neither?  You just walked around and...  Yeah. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah.  It was always...  But it was...  Braces and glasses till my senior year.  Really?  Not helpful.  The only girls you'd fuck had braces or glasses.  I like that.  Coincidence, those are the only girls I'd fuck now.  Braces on their legs so they can't run.  And glasses so they can't identify you.  Polio and blind.  That's right.  I fucked Governor Patterson twice.  In a skirt.  My friends in high school were fucking.  Like, I wasn't, but they were fucking.  God damn.  Like, 14, 15, you know. 
[02:18:00]  Miami?  Cleveland.  That's where I'm from originally.  From Cleveland?  Born and raised, baby.  Really?  They were...  I was super late.  And how much time they do after?  They were all...  And it's funny because they slowed down and I speeded up.  I turned into the guy that was fucking girls on just the one night.  But I started out as like, let me take you to Chili's and I'll call you in three months.  Like, it was...  Yeah.  You kind of learn what girls want.  You know, you gotta...  Like, I don't know what movie's from where they say you can't put the pussy on a pedestal.  I just stopped treating them nice.  Damn.  You know something?  They don't...  They don't understand that. 
[02:18:30]  They understand brute force.  I would do that every time.  And that's why it took so long.  And it's odd that that was my prime directive through high school was to fuck.  To have sex with girls.  And it would take months.  Like, I was on the long-term blue-chip stock plan.  I wasn't day trading, bitches.  I was fucking looking.  You were investing in commodities.  You got a good stock and you're holding it long.  Go long with this, bitch.  So you basically had three shots a year. 
[02:19:00]  That's pretty much it.  Yeah.  I'm like a locust.  I'd come out every few years and just fucking...  I wanted it so badly.  And I would put it on a pedestal where if I did finally get laid, I knew that that was like my girlfriend.  And if she looked at another guy, which of course, you know, she just got fucked.  So she's all like hormoned out, wants more cock.  So I'm going to lose her and be...  I went through my entire high school thing, trying hard to get pussy, finally get some, and then heartbroken when she, you know, fucked my friends. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah, I think a lot of guys...  You've got to understand what kind of girl you're dealing with, too.  Like, some girls need that.  I wanted one with a vagina.  Yeah, but some girls are down with that.  Anything.  It didn't matter to me.  Guys don't pay attention to the girls that are clearly going to...  They want...  Guys want the 5'11 chick and the...  It's like, dude, there's probably a girl that sits across from you in math that'll fucking do whatever.  Yeah.  Fucking focus on the 5's and 6's.  There's nothing wrong with that shit.  You really didn't want to take the abuse from the people around you, your friends and stuff. 
[02:20:00]  If you went around with a fatty or something like that, or a 3, or shit like that, your friends were giving you shit, even though they weren't getting any pussy.  Yeah.  They would look at you like, you know, what the fuck are you doing with her?  So you would look at the girls that were cute and, you know, shit that you wanted, that every guy wanted.  And that's probably why it took fucking months to even get anything.  Yeah, fucking good.  Going, what a horrible time.  It was horrible.  The first pussy I ate...  It's so frustrating.  The first pussy I ate was very hairy and it smelled like urine. 
[02:20:30]  I swear to God, I had no idea what it was like.  Oh, God.  I was like 18 and she was like my age and I licked her pussy and it was horrendous.  It was like somebody dumped piss on Einstein's head.  And I was licking his scalp.  The weird thing is it was like 7 inches long.  That would be a penis.  Is that a penis on Einstein's head?  I was thinking of something really hairy.  How old was she?  Good Lord.  I didn't say Albert Einstein.  I swear that your first is white.  Gray hair. 
[02:21:00]  Her name was Grandma.  Yes.  Bill Schultz from Red Eye is in the studio.  Yes, Bill.  Thanks for having me, guys.  How are you doing, sir?  I'd like to personally apologize to TV's Andy Levy right now because I bumped into Keith Hernandez  in the green room.  A lot of time viewers will note that Andy is a huge New York Metros fan, as we call them,  and I didn't get him an audience.  Mostly because I didn't feel like it.  Thanks, man.  Sorry, man.  How is Keith Hernandez these days?  He was good.  He was like talking to some guy his age who grew up with him or something like that saying,  yeah, we're both old. 
[02:21:30]  Just for men was kind of dribbling down as he talked.  I was going to ask if he had...  He's right there.  If he had used some kind of a beard or a mustache.  He was doing some mustache upkeep when I came in there.  I was transfixed.  Yeah, that's Keith.  Wow.  He looks good.  And he looked better by not giving Andy an autograph.  Why do you like him, Andy?  What's that?  Do you like Keith Hernandez?  I'm a huge Mets fan, but I'm not an autograph guy, so I don't really care.  You really don't care?  Oh, now you're not.  Did you meet Sarah Palin at Fox?  I did.  Did you get a picture with her?  No.  Why?  I don't do those kinds of things. 
[02:22:00]  I don't know.  He's a journalist, and he doesn't want to admit it.  It would have been unprofessional.  Exactly.  He's not a journalist.  He points out when I do the wrong penis reference.  What part of journalism are you not understanding there, Jim?  Is that nominal journalism?  Yes.  Jim is the most unprofessional ever.  People walk by here, and he's like, can I have your autograph?  They're not even celebrities.  Like an intern that looks like, you know, Wesley Snipes.  Yes.  Oh, you're a publicist?  Oh.  I've made a few fucking graphic errors. 
[02:22:30]  Oh, that reminds me of Aziz Ansari.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I found out I was racist because there is a bearded Indian fellow that worked there,  and I was about two seconds away from bumping in and telling him I was a big fan with Andy  as we were on a smoke break and realized, no, it's just an Indian fellow with a beard  who works here.  And I was going to be very awkward for the rest of the week working.  Or maybe he would have taken a compliment.  I love your work.  He's just a guy who fucking cleans the toilet.  Yeah, exactly.  Is that racist, though, just because somebody of a different ethnicity looks like somebody 
[02:23:00]  else and you mistake them for it?  No, I'm just personally a racist, but that had nothing to do with it.  I was just asking an overall question, not you.  I know you better.  If they don't look like the person, it's like, he looked like him.  Didn't he?  You thought he did.  I didn't really see him, sir.  I mean, if there's a celebrity that they look like, but if you think that Al looks like  any black celebrity because he's black, it's not that it's racist.  Just because he's black.  You know what I'm saying?  If the guy looks nothing like the guy.  I'm trying to think of a more boring way to explain this. 
[02:23:30]  Lino Horn.  You look like Lino Horn.  What, motherfucker?  But you can apply to anything.  You can just bump up and introduce yourself to an old person just because you think they're  Abe Vigoda.  Yeah.  That doesn't make you oldest.  Yeah, you don't want to be an oldest.  Yes.  By the way, too soon on the Lino Horn stuff.  I know.  Yeah, yeah.  I just heard 91 years young, as I like to say.  92.  92.  Yeah.  She was, we were talking about her, very crossover because of her white features. 
[02:24:00]  So back in the old days, if she's 91 or 92, she died at 92 just now.  She remembers some shit.  Oh, yeah.  She remembers, you know, hey, get out there and sing and then get out the back fucking  door.  You know?  So, but she was very accepted.  Tonight Show, I remember, things like that.  She would go on with Johnny.  Just be very accepted.  Not like, uh, not like the African, uh, singers we have now.  Wow.  Could absolutely not get on any of those programs.  But could you see Lena just taking a piss in the colored only bathroom? 
[02:24:30]  Poor Lena.  She's probably happy she's dead now.  So I guess we should be congratulating her.  Not happy to remember the horrors of racism.  So kudos to you, Lena, for finally leaving.  At least you got to see a half-black president.  I don't know why you pointed to the desk when you said that.  You're like, he's this color.  Beige.  There's a very embarrassing clip, which they have, of me making an error while I was interviewing 
[02:25:00]  the X-File creators.  Oh, God, yeah.  It's a two-parter.  I've got your question.  Are they short?  How long are they?  Uh, it's 28 seconds and then 50 seconds.  Okay, fine.  Yeah, this is the creators of the X-Files.  Hey, um, um, do you guys, like, when you're, like, when you're in between, like, you know,  you got six years between doing films, are you doing, like, theater and stuff like that?  A lot of actors just get so bored with being known as the same role.  The producers, he's done.  Like, you know, Gandalf, he always wants to go out and do some weird thing.  I mean.  Right.  That's the end, Mike. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah.  I just stopped.  As far as Dave and Jillian go, I mean, Jillian did theater in London where she lives,  and, um, David, I don't think, did any theater.  But, you know, they stayed busy.  Now, he's trying to bring it around and not embarrass Jimmy.  Was that, like, Chris Carter?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he's asking Chris Carter what he does for acting.  And, like, fuck these guys.  I don't want that show.  So then he tries to bring it around by talking about David Duchesne and Jillian, the actors 
[02:26:00]  in the X-Files, who doesn't know about the X-Files.  It was a phenomenon.  I'd never seen it.  What's it like playing an alien, Chris?  I don't know.  Did he eventually correct me for real?  Yeah.  Well, I have one.  You weren't corrected.  I have one.  You found out that they weren't.  That was humiliating.  All right.  Let's hear this one.  Those are the creators, right?  Yep.  Well, Jimmy.  Jimmy seemed to be under the impression they were actors.  A lot of people in some feedback said that, too.  Oh, they weren't actors?  I don't have an idea of who they were. 
[02:26:30]  Do you find yourself?  Are you kidding me?  My mother rolls like the hero, and they're looking at him like, what are you talking about?  I don't know.  Did you do any Broadway?  I was wondering why you...  It was Chris Carter doing fucking Rent.  Chris Carter.  I was wondering why you kept talking about the other actors.  Chris Carter's the creator of the X-Files.  I'm fucking good for me.  All right.  The answer feedback was out there.  There's no fucking idea.  The answer feedback was coming in, and a lot of people going, I think Jimmy thinks that  they're actors.  I thought they were the two leads in the show. 
[02:27:00]  Oh, my God.  That's hysterical.  I swear to God.  Are you kidding?  That would be hysterical.  What a dope...  That's like asking Oliver Stone.  So do you act in theater when you're not starring in the movie?  That's what a fucking asshole I am.  But they didn't call me out on it either.  Yeah, they didn't.  They didn't want to embarrass you, Jim.  They were being courteous.  Hey, those assholes didn't call me out.  Wow.  So, J.J. Abrams, your character, John Locke, is just amazing.  Yeah, that was a fucking dud. 
[02:27:30]  Mr. Spielberg, how long did it take to get into the E.T. suit?  Would you do CGI now?  Did you enjoy playing Hooper in Jaws?  Wow, my fuck.  That was a great faux pas.  That was a fun one.  What are you guys working on for this evening's Red Eye?  I know Jimmy Norton will be joining you.  Yes!  We got Jimmy Norton.  We got the lovely Courtney Friel from Fox News.  I like her, yeah.  She is lovely, yes. 
[02:28:00]  And Ken Blackwell, who works for the Republican National Committee.  Oh, I'm sure he'll be pro-Obama.  Pro-Obama?  Pro-Obama.  Pro-Obama.  And I'm sure we'll have someone from the head of the DNC tomorrow, right?  To be fair and balanced.  Equal time, yes.  All right, good.  Just let me double check.  We have you, Bill.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  I'm the head of the Socialist Committee on the show, actually.  Did you hear Obama talking about technology?  I did.  I did.  And what's your take on that?  Because I don't think it's very good that a president doesn't like this mass communication 
[02:28:30]  we have between each other and an exchange, a free exchange of ideology.  Wait, isn't he the first president with a blackberry?  Is that right?  Yeah, he still has.  Yeah, I didn't really appreciate that part of it.  Do you feel strongly about this?  I feel very strongly about it.  Yes, I do.  I also feel strongly about only white presidents.  But I can't quite just come out and say that.  I thought if I drilled down, I might get to that.  Yeah, you didn't have to drill very far.  Don't take one to get through that, you know.  Drill down, you have to just kick the dirt off the fire. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah.  No, doesn't that seem a little odd, though?  And then him saying he doesn't even use these items.  I think a president would want to kind of be connected to that whole thing.  It's just weird to sit there.  I mean, the guy, like I think Bill's about to bring up, the guy says he can't live without  his blackberry.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But he's going to sit there and say, you kids.  That's Michelle, he calls.  You kids with your...  Have nothing to do with electronics.  I'm going to pretend to be outraged by that. 
[02:29:30]  All right.  I am shaking in average right now and grinning angrily.  You sit there, you're like you kids with your iPods and your iPhones that I don't know  how to use.  Yeah.  But meanwhile, he can't go 10 feet without his blackberry.  He had to get like special dispensation from the Secret Service to carry a Blackberry or  whatever.  Yeah.  I don't know what he's talking about.  Didn't they have...  Obama's Blackberry has two screens, like a blue and a red.  One is a regular, like I guess he's just talking to his wife's screen or talking to friends,  and one is a red screen that is completely encrypted and secure. 
[02:30:00]  Clinton should have had that one.  This is the wife.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He has two different screens.  One is...  Because they couldn't let the president have an unsecure way of communicating, you know,  when you have to communicate.  Someone hacks into it like...  He's on Yahoo chat.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's just pictures of Obama.  You know, goofy.  Prez Obe.  Who's this guy?  Who's this guy showing his dick on camera?  Oh, God.  That's what I would do.  Dude, you're on the wrong screen. 
[02:30:30]  Mr. Obama, you're here with Dateline NBC.  You've gotten your emails about young girls.  I'm Chris Hansen.  I'm sorry.  Which one is the secure screen?  The red one?  Yeah.  They have a picture of the president's Blackberry?  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, he has to, like, switch between, like, modes.  Can anyone get that one?  No.  That's kind of special.  Yes.  The presidential Blackberry.  That would be kind of cool to have. 
[02:31:00]  Last I checked, red's a little communist-y.  That could be a good A block.  Ah, see?  Yeah, it is.  It is.  I suspect some outrage on Beck tonight.  Do you expect some outrage on Beck?  We scooped him.  We scooped him.  That's amazing.  I don't think I've ever seen outrage on that show.  I guess they wanted a red one, so he first.  Outrage Monday.  So he couldn't fuck up.  It's like a red one.  I think there's no way you can mistake what that is.  Believe me.  Drunk texting.  It doesn't matter what color the screen is.  Yeah, fuck it.  I love you.  What did I do? 
[02:31:30]  He's accidentally texting the Secret Service, and the first subject header is, hey.  And then the rest of it.  Whatever it's, hey.  It's something gross on the bottom.  Nothing worse than hitting send, watching that send bar go, and realize it's going to  the wrong person.  Yeah.  And there's nothing you can do.  What is this?  They ought to have a button that you can go, stop it.  Stop it.  Yeah.  Like Gmail has now.  I was going to say, you can delete it, right?  Gmail on a computer, you can undo send for like five or ten seconds or something.  Well, you're just texting, though.  Once you see that bar go, you're just like, this is it. 
[02:32:00]  It's over.  Oh, it's gone.  Yeah.  This is going in there.  And now you have to have an alibi before it hits the end.  Well, the best is when you're not in a great coverage area, and the send bar is crawling,  and you know it's wrong, and it's just totally teasing you.  Please don't go through.  Please don't go through.  Please.  Red X.  Red X.  Red X.  I've done that where it's like, I've sent a text and then gone, now I need an excuse.  It's a photo of your cock.  L-O-L.  Sorry, I thought you were a girl I know, ma'am. 
[02:32:30]  Sorry, mom.  What?  A guy who works at Fox, I won't say his name, but he had one of those droid phones.  It wasn't Hannity.  Oh, right.  He had one of those droid phones, and he was doing whatever instant messaging program  it has, but it was screwing up the names of the people he was talking to.  Oh, that's very dangerous.  So he would be talking to one person, but it would have someone else's name there.  And I think he ended up giving, I'm not sure if he got rid of the phone or not, but that's  like the scariest thing imaginable.  Burn the phone.  It is the devil incarnate. 
[02:33:00]  Get rid of that thing.  Yeah, nothing worse than the wrong email or text, especially when it's something kind  of sensitive.  You know, you're talking relationship-wise or things like that.  You're like, I just screwed myself, and now I have to get myself out of trouble.  This is a text lipstick on my collar right here in the old days.  There's a guy in our D.C. Bureau named Craig Schultz, and every once in a while, I'll get  like, we have this iNews thing where you like top line someone, and sometimes I'll get the 
[02:33:30]  emails, and whenever they come to me, and it's just like, you know, the tape is ready  for the second segment, and I'm like, and I'll always reply back just because I think  it's funny, and you know, they'll know that they screwed up.  I was like, that's great.  You're fucking fired.  And there was one time where I forwarded it to everyone.  I was like, oh, this is a good one.  They'll like this.  And like, apparently, like, all of a sudden, like, one of our producers is like, uh, Bill,  you know, there's a really a lot of important people that you also see on this thing.  I'm like, you know, guys, next time, do it quicker or get the fuck out of here.  I'm sick of this.  And yeah, there's sort of dead sounds after that. 
[02:34:00]  Usually, I'll get like a reply like, LOL, or no, you're kidding.  But that was uncomfortable.  Who's this R. Murdoch?  That's Robbie Murdoch.  Robbie Murdoch.  He's not very funny.  He works down in the mailroom.  The one time I sent an anti-dingo email, and it's over to him.  That's Murdoch from Legal Weapon.  That guy.  What a card.  Have you guys met Roger?  Has he come in or no?  He doesn't come around.  We see him.  We see him in, uh, I've never talked with him.  No.  When the show first started, he had a meeting with us like a couple months in, maybe. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, really?  Murdoch or I think Ailes.  You said Roger, didn't you?  No, I said Murdoch.  Oh, we've seen him, but we certainly never.  No, I haven't.  Roger Ailes runs Fox, and Murdoch runs News Corp, which owns Fox.  Yes.  So Murdoch is the boss of everyone at that building.  So if he likes you, you're in good shape.  We pray every night that he doesn't know we exist.  Exactly.  Under the radar.  I'm uncomfortable talking about it.  Yeah, if we could just move on, that would be great.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's just gloss over this truly great man.  So, OPN baby, huh?  Hey, he defends his people, man. 
[02:35:00]  Calling him Rupert.  Shut up.  Shut up.  He owns the Post, and they had that problem with the cartoonist.  He didn't fire the cartoonist.  He didn't knee-jerk react.  There's a system in place, and the cartoonist just drew it.  I love the fact that he didn't backfire that guy.  Yeah, yeah, that is a good thing, because it's very rare.  Although you're seeing a little more of it now, I think people are getting a little more balls  when it comes to corporations kind of standing up for people.  They're still firing him from ridiculous sexual innuendo and shit like that. 
[02:35:30]  But as far as, you know, Islamic stuff, I think we're pretty sick of Islam at this point.  I think we can all agree on that.  Well, but also, yeah.  The radical argument.  The looks I'm getting around the studio are like, not me, asshole.  I thought I'd just bring you on board my shit.  I would not be a boss for this weekend.  I'd like to say assalamu alaikum to everyone here, first of all.  Well, I will.  Viral friends.  I will agree with Anthony, and you know what?  Just because I'm TV's Andy Levy, I double dare you to do something. 
[02:36:00]  But I know what you mean.  You mean the radical element of Islam.  Everybody's tired of that shit.  The threats.  Oh, the radical element of.  That makes it a little different.  That changed it.  Well, Anthony, because Islam itself is a religion of peace.  Yes.  Yes, we know that.  Yes.  All right.  All right.  Yeah.  Take the bitch and cut her into pieces.  One piece of her goes here. 
[02:36:30]  That whore.  How dare she get raped?  So, how about Opie's wife having a baby?  Yeah.  Yes.  As a matter of fact, I think.  So, by the way, why isn't Opie here?  Did he have the fucking baby?  Lazy.  You kidding me?  He is supporting the lovely Lindsay in her.  Oh, please.  He's taking a vacation.  I know, right?  Well, the baby or her.  They're not up until we're done with the ride.  But it's no vacation.  Like, you've got to stay home.  It's not like.  I can see if he's like, if they're feet fixed and he's staying home.  That's a vacation.  But a baby is going to be crying and yelling. 
[02:37:00]  It's all the more reason to go to work.  Is that all the more reason to go to work?  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  I got a text from Opie that just came in.  Said the boob Nazi just came in to teach breastfeeding.  Very old or broad with a lesbian haircut.  Just wondering, Opie, how does it taste?  Is it good?  Absolutely.  Opie's nursing on an older woman's bosom sitting in her lap.  We should ask her how it feels to be nominated for the Supreme Court.  Yes.  What a looker, though.  She's lovely.  What a beautiful woman.  I know.  I couldn't believe fucking Chaz Cidibono nominated for the Supreme Court. 
[02:37:30]  It's Chaz Bono.  We're in Apple.  Thank you.  Do you see any problems with her?  I will never forgive Obama for not nominating Betty White.  Yes.  She is so hot right now.  He had the perfect chance.  Yep.  And he blew it.  I started an online campaign for that went nowhere.  This woman's not a judge, though, Anthony said.  I didn't know that.  No, no judge.  She's never been a judge.  Who is she?  Right now, she's what?  She's the Solicitor General.  She went to Harvard with Obama. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah.  She was the dean of Harvard Law School.  As far as it goes.  They were friends.  Harvard nepotism.  Smart, smart woman.  Obviously a brilliant woman.  But what does the Solicitor General mean?  What does that mean?  The Solicitor General is the person in the administration that argues before the Supreme Court on behalf of the administration.  So a little experience.  Okay.  A little experience.  It's not like he just picked out.  Either that or I just made that up.  But I think that's fairly certain that's correct.  You got a mic in front of you.  It's true.  I'm actually pretty sure that's right.  So she's like the lawyer who the government says, look, we have something with the Supreme Court. 
[02:38:30]  That's the lawyer they use.  I think so, yeah.  That's a good fucking lawyer.  That's a good fucking lawyer.  Well, she wasn't spending her time on dates.  She certainly wasn't.  She was in those law books.  I guess the Grim Reaper took her out and couldn't get a heart on her.  Yuck.  Who is she not good looking?  Okay, is that what she does?  All right.  So she's got experience with the Supreme Court and she understands a lot about it.  I don't know if she's personally argued before the Supreme Court or not. 
[02:39:00]  I'm not sure.  Have we gotten any of her viewpoints on some of the issues that are so important?  Take down the Kevin Meany photo.  Wow, does she look like Meany.  Oh, she does.  Boy.  That's not right.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  From the That's Not Right case of 1998.  Oh, my God.  She finishes.  Her final argument is always the we all the world bit.  We saw it, Kevin. 
[02:39:30]  She's great, though.  She doesn't have fat forearms.  That's one thing I like about her.  Jesus.  Yeah?  Yeah.  She does.  Horrendous.  Like I said earlier, you should, your indented knuckles should stop once you're three years  old.  They should pop out at some point.  Her hand looks like a baby leg.  Yucky.  That horrible fucking tweed outfit she's wearing.  She works her way up to the career to be appointed as Supreme Court Justice.  And we just look at her on the outside.  It looks like there's a mermaid up her sleeve. 
[02:40:00]  What?  I said, it looks like there's a mermaid up her sleeve.  There's an unbelievable manatee.  There should be boat propeller marks in her arms.  That was horrible.  Those things don't swim deep enough.  What am I going to do?  Well, you know, do we know where she, I'm sure she's pretty far left.  She's actually not that far left.  She's argued, um, she's argued pretty strongly for extending the battle to, to non battlefield  places, like in, in terms of how you treat people. 
[02:40:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Uh, in terms of saying you don't have to, you can treat captured Al Qaeda people as, as  POWs.  You don't have to treat them as criminals.  You can treat them as if it's a military capture.  Well, uh, uh, uh, she's replacing a, a lefty though.  The pretty far left.  Yeah.  I think she's not as far left as him.  That's kind of good.  I thought, are you guys surprised?  Like a holder is now saying that a lot of times maybe the constitutional provisions of  the Miranda rights for, for people arrested for terrorism, even if they're citizens might 
[02:41:00]  have to be redefined a little bit.  So they have a little more time to question him.  Boy, that'd be a, I guess because I'm surprised to hear Eric Holder saying that, I guess because  of the, the implications of how many people are going to wind up dead if they don't get  into the measure.  Isn't that what happened with our little Times Square Pakistani friend?  Didn't they wait a while before reading them as rights or something?  Before they could get, get his, get his, he wouldn't shut up.  They did that.  Yeah.  He came out with a pretty quick.  They just threatened to tickle him.  And he's like, yes, I did it.  And they're like, shut up. 
[02:41:30]  Wait a minute.  You got the right to run out here.  No, I don't even want to hear it.  He just came babbling about everything.  That would be a tough one though.  And I think, of course, I'm always a little cynical when it comes to Obama and his, his  cohorts there with November elections coming up.  I think they want to look a little tougher on terrorism.  So of course they'll talk about this, but do you think you'd ever be able to get anything  passed as far as the constitution goes about Miranda rights and citizens?  It would, it just, it won't work no matter which side you're on. 
[02:42:00]  And it doesn't work.  You're either.  Yeah, that's great.  We shouldn't let terrorists, uh, uh, be Miranda's and, and have rights, but people don't want  American citizens.  But then you have that weird thing now where this guy is a citizen, but a naturalized citizen.  Can he just be deported and then treated like a foreign criminal?  Can't we just deport him and then send him to Gitmo and then stack him up in a pyramid  and Lindy England pointing at him and smoking a butt? 
[02:42:30]  See, the thing is to, you gotta remember, if the citizens...  Now?  Are you saying no?  Have you heard the whole thing?  Yeah, geez, let me finish.  I have a ridiculous idea.  If they're innocent, it's like, you want to make sure citizens are protected.  Right.  But I think a couple of days of questioning, as long as it's handled without fucking being  torturous, you know, I think that's called for.  Torturous is so vague these days, isn't it?  Waterboarding.  Maybe they make you look at this woman's picture for a little while.  Until you confess.  They make you download the Jim Norton app. 
[02:43:00]  Oh, no!  Oh, no!  Why would you go do that?  What else do they make you do?  Go to the Borgata July 2nd and 3rd?  I'll jump right in and kill and plug me in the same thing.  They make you go to Seattle.  Oh, yes!  I forgot.  It's gonna be everywhere.  I'm all over the town, they say.  Jimmy Norton.  Yeah, see, a situation like this guy, I mean, he's kind of yapping, so I guess you  don't have to waterboard him, but it's, I think they have a lot of fun waterboarding  people.  I think it was, I think there was this element of, this is our job, we're allowed to do this. 
[02:43:30]  Let's just go.  Finally the perk.  Yeah, like, you know, I'm sure not every Nazi officer started off like, boy, I sure would  like to do this.  And before you know it, they're running to Brazil.  There's a guy named Seth on television.  Oh, no, wait, that's Elena Kagan.  She looks like a guy named Seth.  Elena Kagan.  It does sound oddly like Rogan.  Wow.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, she really is.  Is not a looker. 
[02:44:00]  And yet Wolf Blitzer looks oddly turned on.  He really does.  Yeah, he's getting lost in her eyes.  Jowls.  He always looks oddly turned on.  Yeah, that's true.  So she's a Solicitor General.  Do you think Obama wants to get her on the Supreme Court?  Because obviously she'll be friendly towards his administration, because she obviously has  affection for him, so then you don't need her as Solicitor General, because you'd rather  have her on the court.  Yeah, I think Obama knows.  Yeah, they're school buddies.  I think you have to be a judge, though.  No.  You don't have to be.  How old is she?  Do we know?  50?  50?  Yeah, youngest nominee ever, I think, right? 
[02:44:30]  Really?  She looks a little older.  Yeah, I will.  She's got to cut down on the cholesterol for the Obama list.  She makes Ruth Bader Ginsburg look like Scarlett Johansson.  Oh, man.  Are they saying if she might have any problems getting through?  Are there any skeletons there?  Any maids, illegal alien maids or anything?  Her biggest problem from the right is going to be that when she was the dean of the Harvard  Law School, she didn't want ROTC on campus because of the don't ask, don't tell policy, 
[02:45:00]  because the military discriminates against gays.  And it was Harvard's policy not to do business with organizations that discriminated against  gays.  Was that a personal matter on her part?  Or was she taking it completely professional and legally?  I couldn't tell you, Anthony.  I believe it was strictly professional.  All right.  Could you conjecture?  Yeah.  I could not conjecture.  Could you read between the lines of the Harvard thing?  But she's also going to take some heat from the left.  She's taking some heat from the left because of the thing I was talking about earlier. 
[02:45:30]  She's pretty, she's fairly conservative in terms of some civil liberties issues.  So.  Yeah.  That's amazing.  Dean of Harvard, you got to be pretty bright.  Could be the dean of Harvard said Jim who had nothing else to say.  Who gives a shit?  What a dumb thought.  Do you think that when she wasn't dean of Harvard, she did some theater like in Broadway?  During your off time.  Well, when she's not starring in The Mall Cop.  I just saw that. 
[02:46:00]  She's a lovely gal.  Justice Blart.  Wow.  The monster of Queens.  Oh, boy.  We don't want them to be.  We got you.  It certainly does.  Oh, my gosh.  She really does look like Paul Clark Monkopf.  Please, can you somehow put a mustache on her?  Oh, wait.  That's Kevin. 
[02:46:30]  Wow.  If she doesn't look like Kevin James.  All right.  Well, whatever.  Odd-looking gal.  Good luck to her.  Yeah.  No, no.  As we say good luck to her after just vilifying her.  But only the best.  Only the best.  She is just hideous.  But anyway, we wish you were.  Godspeed.  Godspeed.  These skeletons don't usually pop out, though, for a little while.  Oh, her skeleton's well hidden. 
[02:47:00]  Under just blubber.  I don't think she's...  All the best.  Yes, exactly.  All the best.  Mazel tov.  Just hideous.  It's a skeleton.  No pubic hairs on the Coke cans or anything?  No.  That was a favorite moment of mine, as far as Supreme Court justice appointments go.  Clarence Thomas was a good one.  Wow.  They just did not want him in there.  But it does illustrate the high caliber of social skills that most Supreme Court judges have.  This would be a great line.  So, uh, that pubic hair on your Coke cans? 
[02:47:30]  That's gonna get me laid.  Yeah, that's great.  He was trying.  Yeah.  You knew it actually happened, because it was too weird to make up.  Like, that's not something you would make up if you were trying to have a pain.  Was her name Anita Hill?  Yeah.  She was not hot.  No.  She was not hot.  No.  She wasn't.  But I think in Clarence Thomas' universe, she was acceptable.  Like, you know, that would probably be upscale for him.  I don't know how many hot chicks hang out around fucking, you know, circuit court judges.  I mean, not many groupies.  That would be the best cop reporter you could have. 
[02:48:00]  I'm like a hot little court reporter-like one?  Yeah.  I'd rather fuck Doug Llewellyn than Anita Hill.  I can't.  I try to get a Doug Llewellyn reference in at least once every day.  You always have to.  No one remembers him for what he was.  His thin, upper lip.  Great.  Not even a bailiff.  What was he?  Oh, he was a reporter.  Rusty Burrell was the bailiff.  Rusty Burrell.  Remember with that gun and his bad prostate?  Sometimes it was hard to tell the difference.  He pulled a prostate on a criminal. 
[02:48:30]  That would be great.  Blow someone's head off over some fucking cat.  Over some cat-suing incident.  She said it was a purebred Persian.  All right.  Oh, yeah.  She does look like Nathan Lane, too.  Wow.  Oh, that's amazing.  She looks just like Nathan Lane.  Good call.  And the photos grabbed.  They're in the same pose, too.  That's amazing.  Head flipped back.  I'm going to go to the toilet.  I'll be right back.  I have to tinkle.  Yeah.  Look at that. 
[02:49:00]  It's amazing she's able to do the Addams Family and come and do these things.  All those photos must have gotten Jim excited.  Yes.  Jim is going to go wee-wee.  We'll take a little break.  I think we've got to do commercials or something, right?  That's what we do during breaks?  Is that what happens?  I have no clue.  I usually just sit here and try to pick up girls on Pal Talk.  Now I actually have to do something.  We'll be right back.  Hurry back, Opie.  Opie and Anthony.  Morning 6 to 11 Eastern on the Virus Series XM. 
[02:49:30]  Hi, folks.  Primetime Sam Roberts here for the Opie and Anthony intern program.  You know, I wasn't always a world-famous celebrity.  I started as a simple Opie and Anthony intern.  Here's your banana, Sam.  Thanks, Matt.  You know, when I first started, what is this?  Is this a goddamn bruise?  Uh, get your worthless ass back down there and get me a real piece of fruit and use your  own goddamn money.  Being an Opie and Anthony intern is an exciting thing. 
[02:50:00]  You'll get to learn new equipment, see a real radio show being produced, and have one-on-one  guidance every step of it.  Hey, Sam.  I have an idea.  Do you see that red light on?  When that fucking light is on, it means I am creating.  Understand that you will never amount to anything of substance.  Now get the fuck out of my face.  So apply now to be an Opie and Anthony intern.  Go to SiriusXM.com slash internships to apply.  Because remember, we all have to start somewhere.  Hey, Sam.  Don't look at me in the eyes, Matt. 
[02:50:30]  Wow, we're back rocking.  Yes, we are.  We come back rocking to the show.  Opie and Anthony program.  Uh, Opie's not in.  He should be out the whole week.  He's, uh, Daddy.  Daddy Opie.  A boy.  Nine.  What was it?  Nine pounds.  Four ounces.  Nine, nine, four.  Big child.  Please tell me that was a cesarean.  And then all nine pounds weren't in the head. 
[02:51:00]  But he's not a big guy and his wife is very small.  It's like they're not, it's not like one of them is a big bruiser.  They're small.  He's, what is he, 5'10"?  I mean, he's not a particularly big dude.  That's a big one.  That's huge, yeah.  That's a big baby.  That's a little Michelin, man.  Well, it was a week, a week late, I guess.  Oh, yeah.  More than a week late.  Did they just go hunt an inducer?  I don't know if they were going to, but they might not have had to.  No, they didn't, right?  They didn't.  What happened?  The water broke?  Did you get the water break story?  Because I didn't.  I want to hear the whole deal. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah, she was actually on Saturday.  Sam Roberts, everybody.  Sam Roberts.  Yes.  Primetime Sam Roberts.  Primetime Sam Roberts.  Star of three radio shows here on the SiriusXM platform.  Thank you for the introduction.  I figured I'd give it to you.  Yes.  My girlfriend was...  And there was some blackness in his history.  He really does.  Mixed, primetime, mixed Sam Roberts.  Primetime mongrel Sam Roberts.  Is she your grandmother? 
[02:52:00]  No, this is all so unnecessary.  No, it goes back.  He's actually traced his ancestry back, and this is true, to Thomas Jefferson.  I remember hearing that.  And you know the hijinks old Tommy Jefferson was up to when he wasn't...  Little brown sugar.  Being one of the founding fathers.  He was fathering all over the plantation, apparently.  I hope it wasn't Thomas Jefferson.  I hope it's George Jefferson.  Might as well make some kind of mistake.  Isabel Sanford, shit him out.  Isabel Sanford. 
[02:52:30]  So anyway, you and your girlfriend are at Monticello.  Continue.  No, my girlfriend was Spoh Studio on Saturday night, because that's when I was doing the  show with Dave.  You're a beautiful girl.  Lovely.  Thank you for saying that.  Had to.  Okay.  Who is all white.  Yes.  Although she's got some Jew in her.  Oh, wow.  Boo.  Can I say that, or just take action?  Hey, guys, I'm right here. 
[02:53:00]  Oh, damn.  Are you Jewish?  Yeah.  Boo.  How funny would it be?  I thought it was the non-Jewish version of Levy.  My God, it's Levy.  Boo.  Off the boat, it was McLevy.  His parents are...  Pronounce it Levi.  Oh, I get it.  You're a self-hating Jew.  How funny would it be if racism couldn't be disguised?  He just came out like that.  Come to my house.  That's my friend. 
[02:53:30]  No.  No.  No.  Oh, God damn.  Come to my house.  Jesus.  Okay, buddy.  Yes, Jessica was hanging out with Lindsay before she came to the studio, and they were at her  apartment, so I texted Jess, and I was like, are you still coming, or are you staying over  there?  And she said, I'll be there in like half an hour. 
[02:54:00]  And then like 15 minutes later, I got a text that, holy shit, holy shit, the water just broke.  Water broke.  And so...  Where did the water break?  In their apartment.  Like where?  On a couch?  Yeah, right?  In the vagina.  I'm not Dr. Spock, but...  Wait, you're not.  Exactly.  They had just cut up some strawberries, and they were sitting down on the couch to enjoy  them.  That sounds like a euphemism for Coke.  Strawberries in the bathroom? 
[02:54:30]  If they were doing that much strawberry, how is this kid nine pounds?  Strawberries on the mirror?  The stuff the girl.  She just sat down to eat some fruit, and all of a sudden, I guess it just happens, right?  They'd been talking about like she was full, because if she was induced, it would have  been done today.  Tuesday, yes.  Or like tonight, whatever.  Tonight, right.  And so they were talking as if, yeah, you know, we're going to do this today, this tomorrow,  blah, blah, blah, and then induce whenever.  Did it ruin a couch is what I'm saying.  I don't know if the guy hasn't seen the couch.  I would have.  I would assume so. 
[02:55:00]  Remember that all?  When the water breaks, is it literally just all of a sudden it breaks, or you feel it  coming, and you can leave, or is it literally the water broke?  No, apparently it's like, oh my goodness, I'm wet.  The water is broken.  Now, is it like a gusher, or is it just sort of like, you know, laugh and pee?  Yeah, I have no idea.  Is it, uh...  I just realized it.  My wife had a baby, and I don't even fucking know.  Yeah, is it a little thing over a length of time, or a lot over once?  Yeah, is it like a bucket?  Yeah.  Is it a tide or a tsunami?  I believe it is.  I think it's a little bit of a tsunami. 
[02:55:30]  I think it's all the shit that's in the stomach, except for the baby comes out.  Stomach, listen to you.  I hope I'm not over your heads with this fucking make-up.  She slowed it out.  Well, it depends on how much, you know, the shit that's in the belly.  Earlier, she swallowed the watermelon seed.  Obviously, in the stomach, it will grow.  I believe it started, and then she had time to run to the bathroom to get the majority.  Oh, really?  Okay.  So, the water breaks, how much time do you have once that happens? 
[02:56:00]  Because I'm sure that they were ready.  They had to have their stuff packed.  They were ready to go to the hospital.  Well, the water breaks.  He didn't have a backpack.  Of course.  Whenever we've been on gigs, and we have had to take trips to various cities and stuff  like that, he never has his backpack.  And, yeah, why would it be any different?  He literally has to fucking run down the runway and follow the plane and come up through  the wheel well.  Looks like Con Air.  This is a vacation that you've got nine months to plan. 
[02:56:30]  At least get some talcum powder ready.  Something in a bag, so when the water breaks, you can leave.  I'm sitting there going, hold it in, baby.  Yes, which shirt should I bring?  What goes well with afterbirth?  To be fair, to be fair, she was only a week late.  He probably thought he had plenty of time.  Yeah, plenty of time.  But as far as I know, like, contractions started, like, 30 or 40 minutes after the water broke,  and then the baby came on.  Oh, people have been using contractions.  How long was she in labor?  Like, after she went into contractions, and like, 16 hours probably after that, the baby 
[02:57:00]  finally came.  Is that a lot of labor?  I think, you know, my wife was in labor for, like, 40 minutes, dog.  They gave her that, whatever that shit is that, no, they gave her an epidural, but there's  like something that speeds up the contractions, and like, because we were just sitting there  watching Rock of Love, like, talking shit, and they were like, all right, let's get this  baby out, and they put Tosin, that's what it's called, it's called Tosin, and they put  it in, and the contractions picked up, and the baby was out in 35, 40 minutes.  So did she have, did she get an epidural, where you, that's where you don't feel, no, 
[02:57:30]  I mean, Lindsay, did she get a, that's where you feel no pain, right?  I'm not sure.  She didn't have first, I don't know if she ended up getting it.  But there's only a certain period where you can get it, right?  I think the nurse actually told her that.  I don't know, Dr. Jim.  There's a pretty, there's a pretty big window, but I think once you're past that window, you're  done.  But epidural is like an injection, it's like an anesthesia, which will stop pain.  We're laughing at you, by the way.  Does anybody know who that is?  No, I just feel like at this point, I feel like you're doing a phoner with a gynecologist  or something.  Yes, I agree.  You're asking all these questions to him. 
[02:58:00]  I don't want to go over your head here, but to use the title term infant, that's actually,  it means baby.  So how do, how do you get pregnant?  I know about that.  You know what, somebody might actually have the answer.  John on line one.  Hi, John.  Hi, John.  Very good.  927, the first phone call of the day.  If you haven't noticed, I'm not the one that likes to take phone calls.  I forgot we had a fucking phone.  Fuck the phone. 
[02:58:30]  That's right.  Kevin from Connecticut, I hope you're hitting a pole right now.  I'm kidding, of course, Kevin.  John, your wife gave birth.  What was it like when the water broke?  Let's put it this way.  You know the ride where the bucket fills up with water, and then it tips over and comes  out?  There's like two gallons of water all over the fucking delivery.  I don't know that ride.  Oh, wow.  What ride is that?  What ride?  Where the water comes out of the vagina.  That's a fun ride.  Is that the ride mayonnaise had to go on and tipped into the water?  Motherhorn?  Yeah, well, I too.  I forgot it. 
[02:59:00]  It didn't quite work.  Oh!  You mean an officer and a gentleman?  Oh, right, right, right.  If I would have said officer and a gentleman, mayonnaise, you thought it was E-Rock.  Where David Caruso couldn't do it?  Remember David?  Yeah.  Did he just hit with the same force as a plane?  Oh, this is nothing compared to a plane.  And they had to go down and get David Caruso?  David Caruso?  Yes!  Well, Frank.  Where were you?  This is just plain silly.  Yeah!  Shades off.  Exits stage right, even.  Oh, what are you saying?  So sorry.  We're just having fun.  Go ahead. 
[02:59:30]  We're doing very well taking callers.  We just yap over them.  I know.  Get mad at them for interrupting with their fucking phone.  Screw you.  All right, so a lot of water came out, huh?  Oh, dude.  At least about two gallons, they said.  Two gallons?  Two gallons is a lot of fucking water.  Come on.  Well, she had twins.  I mean, she was fucking full.  One gallon for a kid.  Did it ruin anything?  No, I don't know.  She was in the living room.  Got the fucking doctors and the nurses.  Oh.  See, I want people that had water break at home.  Yeah.  I want to know what was wrecked.  Like, I would think, I would replace everything with just cheap Ikea shit and then get good 
[03:00:00]  shit after the baby, because you don't know where she's going to go.  It's like that cat that's just saying I can't even afford Ikea shit and you called it cheap?  I would kill you for some Ikea version right now.  I'm not.  I'm not.  I've seen Ikea version.  Only the best for me.  Only the best.  Anthony really is a millionaire.  I had a couch with duct tape on it.  What, sir?  I said, when I see his couch, it's got to be ruined, the carpet. 
[03:00:30]  Dude, that shit comes out, it comes out forceful.  Is this like the exorcist where she's lying down and it goes, like, straight up?  Yeah, straight up.  Oh, wow.  That's hot.  It's almost like squirting.  Where only a baby comes out, which isn't very hot.  No, no, that's still hot.  What, sweetie?  I still took a picture of him eating some pie and getting that in the face.  Wait, we didn't hear your phone broke up. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah.  I said, just imagine.  Yeah, we heard it.  Exactly.  Sorry, Jim, I like stealing your bit.  That's okay.  It's a fun bit to steal.  Right, a pie.  Exactly.  We heard with the pie.  We got enough of the pie.  P.I., do you mean?  3.14?  Boo.  Boo.  Apparently, the pie is an ethnicity that you don't like as well.  What about this guy, Bart, from Jersey?  Yes.  Hey, Bart, from Jersey.  Your wife gave birth?  Yeah, she gave birth about two weeks ago, and she was sitting on the couch. 
[03:01:30]  She started screaming, and she called me downstairs.  She's down there with her pants down to her ankles.  I think it broke.  He talks lower.  I'm so scared.  She was scared?  This is your wife we're talking about, right?  It wasn't too down, that's for sure.  She's screaming her pants down, and she says, I'm scared.  Is there a black channel in there?  You see a black foot going out the window? 
[03:02:00]  A black foot.  You see an Air Jordan slithering out the window?  See you, man.  Goddamn.  She was sitting in there.  She was scared.  I looked for Jimmy Norton.  What's that, sir?  I looked for Jimmy Norton.  We heard you.  Two in a row we got.  Fun every time.  Goddamn.  All right.  Thank you for the call, sir.  Oh, we got a girl, Jennifer, in Detroit.  I like the girl calls, because it's very rare that we get them.  Yeah. 
[03:02:30]  Jennifer from Detroit.  Hi, guys.  Is it cold in the D?  It is cold.  Yeah.  It's like winter weather again.  Yeah.  What part of Detroit are you living?  I live in Grouse Point.  Oh, okay.  So you're all right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  By the way, you do know that about 2,500 milliliters is considered the upper limit of normal for  amniotic fluid.  Wow, he's amazing.  I wish you had said that earlier, Jim, instead of saving it.  My closing bit. 
[03:03:00]  Dr. Steve texted me.  Go ahead, madam.  I just think it's funny that all these guys are calling in, and they have really no idea.  Yeah.  I also had my water break while watching The Wire.  Oh, which episode?  Says Dr. Jim.  But for weeks, I've been sitting on the couch with, like, four beach towels because I was  afraid that this would happen.  Yeah.  And I was sitting there, and at first, I was like, uh-oh, what's that? 
[03:03:30]  And then I shuffled to the bathroom, and sure enough, the water broke, but it's not a  ton at once.  It's slowly leaking for a very long period of time.  And by water, I don't expect it looks like it's coming out of a Brita filter.  It's probably...  See, actually, I kind of expected that.  Did you, like...  I would have had a nice crop.  Just crystalline clear.  I already have my eyes there.  Oh, let's do this.  Is it a little mucky and... 
[03:04:00]  Mucky.  No, at first not.  And then by the time I got to the hospital, I wasn't really looking at it anymore.  Looks like crystal light.  What does it taste like?  Yeah.  I can imagine that.  That I don't know.  So it just comes out, like, kind of steady and...  Yeah, but for a lot, for a long period of time.  And then, you know, you call the doctor, he says, get in here, and then usually you have  to give birth within 24 hours of your water breaking. 
[03:04:30]  Do contractions hurt?  Or is it just the coming out part that hurts?  Was it just in the movies when they're screaming?  Yes.  Well, look, there's lots of sci-fi that could have been involved there.  And by the way...  Answer the question.  Yeah, please stop being so evasive, madam.  What are you hiding?  Listen, baby maker.  Exactly.  Please.  The onus is on you to explain.  Huh?  No?  I missed all that.  I guess that's it from old trickle vulva.  All right. 
[03:05:00]  Sorry about that.  My theory is that giving birth doesn't hurt at all.  It's this big fraud that women are perpetrating on men to make us cater to them and feel  bad.  And it really actually feels good.  Oh, imagine that.  It just felt like a big, long orgasm.  Yeah, but they're taught, okay, you have to act like you're in a lot of pain.  We're going to pretend to give you a shot.  Curse at them.  Yeah, and meanwhile, they're feeling great.  Yeah.  I didn't know most girls take a huge shit when they're having, like, a baby.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  No way.  Yeah, they're pushing.  What do you think?  You can control which fucking thing you're pushing out? 
[03:05:30]  I can't.  You're pushing as hard as you can.  You can, right?  Fuck.  I think it's a nice quality log, dude.  Really?  I think a lot of chicks.  I can't remember.  It actually makes sense.  I can't remember the last time I was pissing and it didn't shit in my pants.  I mean, of course, I'm assuming that happens to you guys, too.  Am I right, fellas?  Am I right?  Am I right?  Who's with me?  Who's with me?  That's why I've got towels on my couch. 
[03:06:00]  Brian in California?  That's something I was disgusted about.  If something like this would happen.  Hey, Brian.  Yes, Brian.  This is Brian.  Hey, my wife.  We were sleeping, expecting our baby.  It came up to the due date.  About 3 a.m. in the morning.  She goes, I think I just peed in the bed.  And it wasn't.  It was pretty interesting.  So were you laying in her broken water? 
[03:06:30]  No.  That didn't seem too fun to me.  But, yeah, as far as wife giving birth and it not hurting,  my wife was actually laughing through her birth.  Because she was so choked up.  Married to the Joker.  Let me see that man.  That's great.  I married a retarded girl.  She laughed through the whole thing and ate paint chips.  And it wasn't a baby, actually.  She made it cocky. 
[03:07:00]  Into her fucking suspenders.  We named it Peanut.  She thought it was a baby.  She held up a cocky and carried it around.  She didn't know any better.  What do I care?  All these early 70s terminology.  I put a bowl on her head and give her hair cut.  It came out of her coolie.  Remember a coolie?  You used to call an ass a coolie?  Yeah, a coolie.  I don't know why.  If you go even further back, that was a Chinese worker for the railroad. 
[03:07:30]  A coolie?  Yes, the one with the pointy hats.  I love how you're a professor of arcane racist terms.  I don't believe in the...  You can read more.  For more, check out Anthony's pamphlets.  They'll be in a mailbox without a return address.  The great thing about coolie is you can get away with saying it on TV these days.  Yes, yes.  It's a very good racist term to use.  They'll know what it means, but other people won't.  It's very safe.  I'm like the N-bomb, which is pretty much off limits these days. 
[03:08:00]  Oh, my God.  I'm cane racist terms.  Dot org.  You're the webmaster.  Oh, shit.  Do we have any more girls on the phone?  Where's a girl?  I don't know.  I don't think Ziggy's a girl.  That's about it.  Sam, the girl's water broke.  Oh, no.  It's Jim C.  Yeah.  She was laying on my boat with a flat ass.  She got placenta all over my members only, Jack and Sam. 
[03:08:30]  I've been partaking and watching a little Quincy.  And who brought up the fact that it's like this very powerful music dance?  And you've got to have the goofy...  Because it's Jack Clark.  Is that Danny?  Somebody brought it up.  Might have been you.  Everybody just knew he was a funny guy.  Bill Burr, I think.  It could have been Burr, yeah.  But I've been watching some Quincy episodes.  And how this show was on the air and people watched it and took it seriously is beyond me.  As a girl, she was smoking contaminated grass. 
[03:09:00]  Was that one of them?  Oh, yeah.  Talking about grass and man.  And just...  He tried to take down a magazine like High Times Magazine.  Only it was called Far Out Magazine.  And there was an ad in it.  Because of the kids saying.  Yeah, the kids are calling it Far Out.  And there was some kind of an ad in there for this chemical that made plants grow really big.  And kids were using it to make their pot grow big.  Sure.  But it would kill some of the kids that were using it. 
[03:09:30]  And he's like, if one more child dies, I'm going to that...  And he went to the magazine and talked to the editor who was one of these...  I don't need to be hassled by the man.  By the man.  And meanwhile, we're just always laughing at how...  He's the coroner.  He's supposed to be sawing someone's head open and weighing a brain.  Not out doing what detectives are supposed to be doing.  Coroners are never caught in a web of intrigue.  No!  No, there's never car chases with the coroner. 
[03:10:00]  He's never questioning people.  Yeah, but we do that with CSI.  Yeah, yeah, same thing.  What the fuck are those people doing?  Well, they're supposed to be in the lab or at the crime scene.  They're not supposed to be going to suspects' apartments.  When I watch things like First 48 or Cold Case Files, things like that,  you'll see the detective will get a lead on who the suspect is.  And then they call the cops.  Right.  They call officers or the SWAT team or whoever has to go in,  depending on what this guy did, and get him out.  They're not there knocking on the door. 
[03:10:30]  David Caruso is, you know, with his gun out.  But then, no, they're like, hey, I need some detectives on my patrolman to back this shit up.  There's no reason for anyone in bones to be in a car.  Yes!  Not at all!  They don't even get to deal with the flesh.  They're just, it's all like...  Yes!  And Quincy is out there just investigating crime.  He went over one of the girls that died from smoking grass.  And he goes over the house and was like, do you mind if I look in a bedroom for, like, clues? 
[03:11:00]  And he's looking for, he's the coroner!  And he's going through our music boxes and trying...  Taking her panties.  Yes.  Well, let me smell these.  I need to know if she had an yeast infection.  And he finds pictures of her.  Frederica Bimmel!  I was watching the very first episode of Quincy.  Ooh, the first one, the pilot.  Yeah, he actually travels to Mexico on his own dime. 
[03:11:30]  For what?  For an investigation.  Because he was, you know, he had to go figure out who the murderer was.  So there was some connection.  You gotta go to where the jazz cigarettes are first made.  Sam, I don't touch them.  I just like to look at them.  And they're so small.  I go to Mexico and photograph them.  Book me a flight to Thailand.  He brought his live-in girlfriend with him to Mexico.  And then they get into a car accident where, like, the car goes over, like, the cliff. 
[03:12:00]  Like, that cliff down.  And then he leaves her there and flies back to the United States to finish the big investigation.  He left her in Mexico?  At a Mexican hospital?  Well, she said it was okay, so...  Oh, okay.  He was only interested in she's dead.  That's true of my expertise.  Into slavery.  It's in my chest of drawers.  Chest of drawers.  You know he tried to expense it, too.  He tried to expense it.  They were like, what the fuck were you doing in Mexico?  Quince, what are you doing?  Yeah, the gruff lieutenant guy.  Monaghan. 
[03:12:30]  Yeah, it was Lieutenant Monaghan.  Was that a lieutenant?  Yeah, Quince, we can't do it.  We're too busy.  Yeah.  You do it because if another child dies, it's on your head.  How does this bill from Club Med have anything to do with the child dies?  It was a family Club Med.  I was investigating.  It was apparently chlorine poisoning from the pool and margarita poisoning.  Quince, the guy was shot in the head.  No coroners out there investigating. 
[03:13:00]  But you know what?  I remember it was on in my house when I was growing up all the time.  Definitely.  And people would talk about it like, wow, do you see Quincey?  What?  It's about an ugly 55-year-old coroner.  How shitty would it be to live in a time where the water cooler talk was Quincey?  Did you catch the Quincey last night?  And then Sam came in and helped Quincey.  And he opened the refrigerator.  You thought it was going to take out some kind of a human organ.  And it was a sandwich. 
[03:13:30]  And they thought it was an amoeba, but it was only Sam's genitals.  And his jet black pubic hair.  I forgot about Sam.  Sam and Quilsey.  Quilsey?  What show was that?  That was a girl.  That was the leather Tuscanero of Quincy.  Shows like that and Cannon was another one.  Big fat.  Cannon was great.  And I remember the coolest thing.  Cannon had a phone in his car.  And it was a phone like you would have in your house at the time. 
[03:14:00]  With a coiled wire that went to this big box.  And I thought it was so cool.  Because he'd like pick it up.  And it would be like, mobile operator.  Mobile operator.  Get me 555-3821.  And they'd have to go through like this special mobile operator.  But he was driving the convertible and talking on the phone.  It was like, wow.  To fucking be at the point in history where you could do that.  That is fucking good.  And then a cop pulled him over.  What are you doing?  You're not supposed to be on that thing.  You know.  In 40 years. 
[03:14:30]  You'll fat fuck if you're dead by then.  And those who.  Cannon.  A Quinn Martin production.  Epilogue.  Yeah.  They'd have like chapters.  Like it was a big drama.  This was the theme song to Cannon?  Cannon.  Cannon.  And what could Cannon do?  He weighed.  William Conrad.  William Conrad.  He couldn't.  Yeah.  He was giant.  Sweating constantly.  And they did show him a couple of times trying to pursue people.  And he would catch them. 
[03:15:00]  You'd see him get out of his car and run.  They'd go around a corner.  And then the next scene he's got them on the couch.  It's like, how the fuck did he catch that guy?  This 21 year old black kid.  He just wades from around the counter and just sort of falls on him.  Like a timber type movie.  That's why every year at the Emmys they'd say, and the winner for best editing is Cannon.  There it is.  Cannon.  Oh, there's the Quincy cast.  Maddox.  I prefer the Quincy gang.  Wait. 
[03:15:30]  Who's the other one on the left?  Who's that guy?  Looks like Quincy's son.  Who's that guy?  There's Quincy, Sam, his boss.  I bet that's a gruff reporter that was always after the story that Quincy had.  That Quincy, I can't tell you now.  I'm embroiled in an investigation.  If only I was as tenacious as Quincy was.  Yes.  If only I was willing to use my own money.  My room is messy.  Wait.  Wrong show.  I grew up on those shows, and at the time, they, I guess, were the shit, you know? 
[03:16:00]  Yeah.  Your parents would sit there and just be glued to this stuff like it was fantastic.  Mannix.  This is what happens when you would only have four channels.  Like, stuff like Quincy would be...  That God forbid you changed it too quickly.  Yeah.  You gotta break it!  Invent a remote.  What the fuck you want from me?  Yeah, you couldn't go from, like, channel two to channel eleven.  Right.  Right.  You'd be quick, or you'd get yelled at.  Yep.  But for some reason, you had to really fast. 
[03:16:30]  You're gonna turn that knob right off the TV.  Yeah.  Hey, you're right.  I did.  Every TV, you always end up having to use the pliers to change it.  That little white thing that stuck out, you'd have to maneuver.  And then you'd have to actually tune, like, you'd have to fine-tune your television.  I definitely remember that shit.  It was fucking ridiculous, just trying to watch quality television.  You never had a clear picture of anything.  It was always kind of...  Jimmy, nice one. 
[03:17:00]  It was always kind of staticky.  The sound would never be good enough to pick that up.  Or the ghosting you'd get from another channel.  Yeah.  Like, if you're watching ABC here in New York, you'd get the Connecticut Channel 8.  It would always ghost in on you.  So you're watching Quincy, and some fucking, like, Channel 8 show, a cooking show, is on.  And it would be like a white ghost with wavy lines cooking over Quincy.  Yeah.  So much cooking food.  There's a meatball in my colon, Sam. 
[03:17:30]  Every time I go into these breaks, people go, you're old.  I was like, yes, I had a Sony Trinitron.  I had a zenith.  We all trusted Walter Cronkite?  Yes, we did.  What time is Dana calling?  I don't know.  It was supposed to be like...  Oh, 945.  Oh, I thought it was 915.  Oh, silly me.  We'll keep an eye out for him.  I started that.  I apologize.  We'll keep an eye out for him.  He paddled after a Japanese show? 
[03:18:00]  Really?  What was?  Frank Canna Quincy was a Canadian show before it was...  I have no idea.  Let me hear.  Hey, Don from Nevada.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hello, Don.  You have some Quincy information?  My God.  No, back then, there was a coroner in L.A.  He was a Japanese guy.  I can't remember his name.  Ken Noguchi.  Quincy.  But he would...  That was before...  Thomas Noguchi.  I'm sorry.  He was getting really in the way in investigations. 
[03:18:30]  I remember him catching shit all the time by the cops and the government people for getting  involved in investigations.  Oh, really?  Can I ask why nobody's impressed that I knew the name of a Japanese coroner in L.A.  from the 70s?  I am.  I thought you just made that up.  I know that's true, too.  You're a very good actor, Jim, and you do that.  You go like, oh, I know who it was.  You'll know I'm wrong if I go, Thomas Noguchi!  Look that up.  Is that right?  Just look up.  You'll never get Noguchi. 
[03:19:00]  And he would get involved with investigations and, I guess, piss people off?  So Quincy was supposed to...  Why did they...  I guess that's why Sam was in it.  That's what happens in real life when a coroner gets involved.  Just pisses the cops off.  Yeah, yeah.  Always run and annoying.  Suspandating crime scenes, you idiot.  You don't have your booties on.  O.J.'s running loose because of you.  Adult.  Is that him?  He almost looks like Quincy...  Thomas Noguchi.  Looks like Quincy squinting because he can't see his page in front of him.  He's a face like Quincy and a cock and balls like Sam. 
[03:19:30]  Boo on both counts.  Good job, Quincy.  We've got to let this murderer go because you questioned him illegally.  Yeah.  Very good.  Thanks a lot.  Thanks again.  That's 22 this month.  Guess what, Quincy?  Another child did just die because of you.  That's it.  All the defense attorney would have to do is...  Was a coroner on the crime scene actually talking to my client?  Uh, yes, he was.  All right.  Case dismissed.  What the fuck happened? 
[03:20:00]  So let me get this straight.  A child will die now.  Oh, dear.  We let him murder around.  Just one drop is enough to wipe out California.  It's botulism.  My fault.  My bad.  Word is bond.  I love how Quincy's using the my bad term 30 years before his premiere.  I'm way ahead of my time, Sam.  What up with that?  Email me. 
[03:20:30]  I'll send you a text.  What's Quincy?  I'm at quincy at interruptingcrimescene.com.  I'm at the tip of the dot-com bubble, Sam.  I love red tube and ex-hamster.  I just Twittered some false entomely.  I tweeted crime scene photos, which will get the case thrown out.  I have my own app.  Quincy app.  Quincy, don't Twitter pick that.  It's all right.  It doesn't exist yet. 
[03:21:00]  It's a Q on your phone, and you press it, and it opens up.  As you can see, we're Quincy clothes shops.  You can buy my jacket and slacks at quincy.com.  Actually, Quincy Emmy.  Quincy is a place in Massachusetts.  Holy shit.  She was killed when an Asian cyber-squatted on her face.  His balls and assholes smothered her.  My Twitter is the real Quincy. 
[03:21:30]  Someone took Quincy.  Exactly.  I wanted to be the real Quincy.  Someone's got Quincy, and they're just Twittering pedophile jokes.  Son of a bitch.  They're saying I have gay porno mustache hairs in my rectum.  I wish these cowards would face me.  They say I like to put Monaghan scrotum over my face.  I would never Twitter that, Sam.  They photoshopped a big cock on Sam.  He's happy, but I'm not.  They put my face on LemonParty.org. 
[03:22:00]  I thought I was going to a forensic page.  It was meat spin.  It's Photoshop.  Me and Sam were not docking.  We were both cut.  Quincy is very much not LOLing right now.  Send.  Holy shit.  Who is Ralph?  Oh, that's rolling all over floor.  I thought it was a guy. 
[03:22:30]  Are you still there, sir?  Anthony.  Yeah, what do you need?  It's still Don from Nevada.  What's up, man?  Sorry.  The other thing, when you get up and change the channel, they also had the fancy high-tech  rotary antenna where you had to turn the knob on top of the TV to make your antenna turn.  Was that connected to anything?  Like, there was a little knob.  This guy stayed on hold for 10 minutes to see that.  If it's not Quincy-related, I don't see.  That comment times zero equals zero. 
[03:23:00]  Well, Jim, technically anything times zero equals zero.  Oh, stop now, literal math guy.  Actually, Andy's right.  Andy.  Always on budget.  Thanks, buddy.  Yes, thank you, sir.  But there was those stupid antennas that, now that he brought it up, it had a dial on  it that did nothing.  Like, I don't know what it was for.  If you had the rabbit ears, now you're really going back.  I'm sorry.  No.  I don't mean to, um, I don't mean to, uh, sound this old. 
[03:23:30]  I get better reception with Fios.  I was using cable vision.  I went to Fios.  I had much more bandwidth.  I had wireless internet.  Accidentally, my neighbor downloaded things from my hard drive.  And my network wasn't secure.  The colonel and I were file trading, along with Jeffrey Jones from Curse Bueller.  Oh, same Gary Glitter.  Same Gary Glitter. 
[03:24:00]  Banana, nah, nah.  Hey.  He's singing Gary Glitter.  Dana's phone went straight to voicemail right now.  Oh, right.  Maybe he's firing another UFC star.  That's right.  Maybe he's, uh, maybe he's sleeping.  See, mine's a little more exciting.  That's right.  He's out there.  Hey, you.  I know.  You just think Dana's, the reality is he's fucking right now face first down in a rug.  Drunk.  Keep your goddamn hands off him.  His pants are down.  He's holding a pabst.  Drunk.  Is he a drinker?  I don't think he is. 
[03:24:30]  I don't know what he does.  I don't think he's a drinker.  He does run that organization with, ooh, the Iron Fist.  Yeah.  If he doesn't like what people are doing, he'll either bitch them out or you're fired.  Loving fucking the UFC show, too.  Yeah?  It's fucking great.  Is it, is it, yeah, is it good, like, a storyline behind people beating the shit out of each other?  Yeah, it's like they're all in the house together, but it's not corny storylines.  It's like they have injuries, and, you know, there's a fight every week, and you get to  watch these up-and-coming fighters that are sloppy, and some of them are really fucking, 
[03:25:00]  there's a guy named Jamie Yeager.  He's a black guy with a giant afro.  Is anybody watching this show?  I saw that, yeah.  That fucking son of a bitch.  Bobby Kelly put it best.  He said he's built like a fucking, what do you call it, a video game character of a UFC fighter.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  He's in perfect physical shape.  And he's a great fighter, yeah.  But the whole storyline thing is...  It's interesting, yeah.  Like, that would upset, that would just be like, oh, okay, can you get to the beating  the shit out of each other?  There are guys that genuinely don't like each other.  I think it's very interesting.  I just, I love how Jim wore his UFC sweatshirt, even though this is a phoner for Dana. 
[03:25:30]  See, I support you guys.  It's a sweet side in here.  Said to have been sober for 17 years, Dana?  Wow, really?  Well, I'm said to have been sober for 20 years.  Who said that?  I said it over a drink last night.  Anyone can say it, yeah.  Who does it, though?  I didn't know that.  I know that.  A red-eye cast likes to tip a few back.  Holy jeez.  Do they?  Do they ever? 
[03:26:00]  That's why the show's on at fucking three in the morning.  Gutfeld can't wake up.  That's when he's first waking up.  Be a drink, goddammit.  Has he just been intolerable with that book now?  Oh, insufferable.  Yeah, he's just like horrid, just all full of himself.  Just awful, but he has a book out?  It actually hasn't been any different from the previous three years.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, that's true.  It's out at the end of the month, right?  I believe so, yeah.  Yeah, I read probably about 25, 30 pages.  It's really good, man.  Yeah, it's funny stuff. 
[03:26:30]  It's really funny.  Yeah, the people who wrote it were really good.  Just slapped his name on there.  Great head ghostwriters.  Keith Olbermann.  Hats off to the ghostwriters, Bill and Andy.  You guys are getting a little more attention and recognition, though.  And you're kind of afraid of that?  I mean, it's that double-edged sword thing.  I never wanted the show to be known, per se.  Yeah, yeah.  Because it is a double-edged sword.  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  You can demand a little more. 
[03:27:00]  No, no, we haven't found that.  No, no, none of that ever.  Have they ever talked about...  Well, you can demand a little more.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I demand things of you, you demand things of me, but we're not going to say anything to  the brass.  Have they ever talked about moving your time slot?  No.  No?  There's really nowhere to put it.  Really?  Yeah.  Well, also, like, you know, you got, like, we're 12 o'clock at West Coast, so you figure  the core Fox audience that's watching during the day, you go any earlier, and then all  of a sudden, they're starting to watch it in the West Coast, and that's when the letters  I think would get really angry.  Oh, right, right. 
[03:27:30]  Yeah.  You need people that are only up at three.  Right.  Yeah, crystal meth heads.  Exactly.  Or our people, as we like to call them.  They're following Glenn Beck repeat, though, but that gets big numbers.  I mean, it's fucking Glenn Beck, so...  Yeah, absolutely.  And these guys do...  Red Eye does higher numbers than a lot of the CNN 8 o'clock shows.  I mean, they do tremendous ratings, but just...  It's low compared to, say, fucking Hannity or O'Reilly, who, you know...  Yeah.  But it's still tremendously impressive ratings, you guys.  For now, Jim.  Yes.  For now.  You guys do better than most of the networks.  And also later. 
[03:28:00]  I was watching the Hannity that I did last week.  I swear, I really do come off like just a screaming racist.  It's one thing to be sitting here and talking into a microphone.  When you're watching yourself on television saying certain things, I'm just like, ooh.  Do we have any...  Ooh.  Do we have any...  Do we have any Anthony on Hannity?  I was going to say, I need to hear this.  I apparently went off on Mexicans.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  That's so not like you.  I know.  We're talking about that Arizona... 
[03:28:30]  Wait, but let's define our terms about what hard workers they are.  Is that what you said?  No, something about a burden.  I don't know.  It was...  Wait, does anyone have a tissue?  Oh, wow.  Anthony makes Pat Buchanan uncomfortable.  I just remember that time Mangalow went to Anthony's house and was like, dude, what's  with the Nazi stuff?  Lighten up here.  Exactly.  We got it.  You like the era. 
[03:29:00]  That was years ago.  Enough is enough.  Even...  Seven rooms, really?  Even Bon Jovi cut his hair.  You got to move on a little bit.  You got to move on.  Wait, can we hear a little bit of Anthony on Hannity?  I really want to hear that.  I did not watch...  I never watched myself on TV.  Yeah, it's a little rough.  You're just trying.  The Phoenix Suns are going to wear Los Suns jerseys in tonight's game in the series against  the San Antonio Spurs.  The team's owner has spoken out about this.  Is that for Cinco de Mayo or also for the...  It's just for the honor, the Latino community. 
[03:29:30]  Yeah, but it's a direct response to the Arizona law, which obviously I read as kind of he hasn't  read the law because it doesn't do what he says it will do.  A lot of people have a misconception on that law.  For me, that my sports team becomes a political activist, I am done.  I mean, can't we just play ball?  Well, they're talking about the all-star game, so another sporting event taken out of Arizona.  Uh-oh.  I know.  Well, you try to politicize everything.  Anything that's popular, they try to politicize it. 
[03:30:00]  But I honestly, since my teens up until now, if a police officer asks me for identification,  I give it to him.  In 42 states, you have to have it.  You have to have it.  And I give it to him.  And you know what?  If I was doing something wrong, he writes me up.  If I'm not, I go on my merry way.  I don't see a difference in it.  Oh, you don't see the difference?  Skin color might be the difference.  You know what?  Skin color...  I'm sorry, Mexicans are browner than white people.  That's just the way it is.  And they're the ones that are illegally coming to the border, so that's who we have to... 
[03:30:30]  You think there are no Mexicans who are light-skinned?  No, they're all...  You're really wrong.  Look, I'm not covering everything.  I'm just saying that because a majority of the people that are going to be sent back are brown-skinned,  does not make it racist.  It makes them Mexicans that are illegally.  Let me just say this.  Governor Brewer has even amended the law to try to make sure that racial profiling  is not the issue.  Was that guy a conservative or a liberal?  Liberal.  That's one word.  Because he was wrong.  He contradicted himself.  Yes, he did.  He goes about skin color, and then Anthony goes, well, all right, so they're brown, they're 
[03:31:00]  Mexicans, and then the guy goes, some of them are light.  Well, then if some of them are light, and you're against the fucking Arizona law, then  it's not about skin color.  When faced with a racist and I'm flustered.  Well, I mean, actually, they didn't get to my favorite part with Anthony, where he was  talking about, like, I hate when they involve themselves in politics.  Like, I loved the Dodgers until they did that Jackie Robinson shit.  What was wrong with our league and the Negro League?  I mean, come on.  They were successful.  You're right, by the way.  I was saying.  Sam just brought up the dirtiest Mexican we've ever seen. 
[03:31:30]  Damn Louis C.K., who is our red-headed guy Mexican.  Of course.  I did not know that.  Louis C.K. is half Mexican?  Yes, he is.  He's, like, all Mexicans.  A lot Mexican.  Really?  A lot Mexican.  I had no...  Guess I won't be watching that show.  Louis is not so lucky anymore.  No.  Also, he got canceled.  Yeah, that was why.  I blame Jim.  Everything I touch.  We'll talk about...  I was gonna...  I have an hour to discuss with you.  Everything I touch dies.  Spider-Man was quite the success story, sir. 
[03:32:00]  Yes, it's because I had one line.  I'm in furry vengeance.  7% on Rotten Tomatoes.  Yeah.  I don't think it was your fault.  Leno got five months and died on fucking primetime because of me.  No.  Lucky Louis, one and done because of me.  Down and Dirty, four episodes and done because of me.  The original Opie and Anthony show, canceled because of me.  Tough Crowd, two years and done because of me.  Zack and Miri, Seth Rogen's lowest grossing film because of me. 
[03:32:30]  Oh, wow.  I am a fucking cancer.  But I'm looking forward to doing that.  I was just gonna say, yeah.  Wow, you know something?  Hey, Anthony, are you free tonight by any chance?  Yeah, I think I can make it.  No problem there and there.  I don't think my point was being understood because it is such a fast-moving program and stuff.  But what I was saying was...  That they should all swing back to where they came from.  Yes.  Right across the road.  Rio Grande. 
[03:33:00]  He said it's all about skin color.  And I'm saying, well, the skin color would be brown if he's bringing up skin color.  But they're Mexicans.  If you're looking for organized crime from Sicily, you'd be looking for Italians.  Right, but his point is...  I'm not saying I agree with it, but his point is that Hispanic Americans who are citizens may be unfairly profiled and stopped.  Stopped and questioned about things? 
[03:33:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  So what?  It's how it happens.  What are you gonna do?  If you got your car...  You got ID?  You got ID?  You don't have drugs in your car?  You got ID?  You're not fucking doing any shenanigans?  That's the 11th Amendment, I think.  Then you're fine.  I like how Anthony thinks that he wouldn't be stopped in Arizona.  I wouldn't.  You know what I would do?  I'd hand my ID over and go, thank you, officer.  That's the thing.  I'd give him my PBA card.  I know a man.  You're a professional bowler.  Yes.  As long as it's handled politely and respectfully, I think. 
[03:34:00]  You gotta...  You know, it's almost like after the Oklahoma bombing, I literally got stopped every time I went to an airport.  And people were cool about it.  I didn't take it personally.  I knew what it was.  I wasn't like, I'm not the guy.  As long as they're not...  As long as they're not dicks to people.  I mean, it's hard, though, if you're a citizen getting stopped.  That is a little...  This law, though, is not about just randomly grabbing Mexicans and asking, where are your papers?  This is, if there is some type of thing going on where they would normally pull you aside and ask for ID, they can ask for your green card or for your... 
[03:34:30]  To see if you are indeed a citizen.  And let's be real.  There's some fucking problems coming across that border.  It's not all fucking housekeepers and fucking landscapers.  Huge crime.  There are some gang members coming.  Phoenix apparently is, what, the kidnap capital of the United States?  Phoenix is a problem, man.  I mean, there's human trafficking going on.  And that's what that's...  A lot of it, it's 40 people in a house.  So Arizona just said, fuck this, we're going to deal with it.  The crime rate in Arizona has dropped like 20% in the last 10 years or so.  Has it? 
[03:35:00]  Yeah.  But how come they say it's the...  Wasted.  How come they say it's the kidnap capital?  Well, it's people like you who say that, Anthony, because you're pushing...  Pull up the crime stats.  Because you're pushing a political agenda that involves getting rid of anyone who's not white.  It's from your network.  I learned it from you, okay?  I learned it from you.  Yes.  Retract, Andy.  Retract right now.  All right.  We'll fucking watch CNN.  Fuck is all.  Watch Larry King.  Oh, he's always good.  That blithering fool. 
[03:35:30]  You know what we'll do?  We'll take a quick break, because I see Danny there as the executive producer of the on-air  program for today.  And probably all this week.  Running the board.  Thank you, Danny.  But Steve...  Running the board for me.  Steve's not the one who's...  Who's Steve?  Yeah.  Is he here?  Yeah.  Oh, I didn't know.  So with Danny being...  Oh, no.  I assumed Danny was the executive producer, because he was the guy that ran out and got  some stuff that we needed.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm not disagreeing.  I'm just...  I don't think you'd ever disagree when I bash Steve. 
[03:36:00]  No.  All right.  We'll take a quick break, and we'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  Yeah.  Wow.  Travis is rocking us back.  Rocking.  I was being a bit of a homo over the weekend.  And just YouTube, because I was realizing I don't know much new music.  I listen to lithium.  I take lithium.  I listen to lithium.  I'm stuck in the 90s, as far as my music goes. 
[03:36:30]  So I figured, you know what?  I'm going to listen to some of the newer music on YouTube, because then I'll get the multimedia  experience of seeing the personality and hearing the song.  So I was listening to some of the Lady Gaga, some of the Lady Gaga, and watching some of  her videos.  What song?  Um, I believe I listened to, uh, the one that goes, you know, la la la.  Bad Romance.  Yeah, yeah.  Bad Romance. 
[03:37:00]  It is a visual tour de force.  And yes.  And paparazzi.  Oh, another one.  Bad Romance has 201 million views.  Jesus Christ.  Well, that's, and one.  It's got 201 million.  201 million.  I watched and listened.  And, um, I, I, I, I, although I would have sexual intercourse with her, I wasn't quite  enjoying the, the music.  What? 
[03:37:30]  I just wasn't quite there with it.  She is a weirdo.  It's less about the music than the whole package.  Is that what it is?  With this visual, as well as aural artist.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Big clit in my pants.  This is very loud.  Oh, one thing I was noticing is she does seem to be bringing the extravagant video back.  Yes.  Yes.  Is that, uh, is that what they're saying?  Because I don't know.  But, uh, because I know during the 80s, the extravagant big, like Madonna videos, very big. 
[03:38:00]  Yeah.  And, uh, she seems to be high budget on me.  And she's bringing back the video narrative.  And I don't get it.  Oh, you don't?  Just like the old videos.  What does this mean?  What is she doing?  Performance art.  It's performance art?  Yeah.  I hate performance art.  I like this video, actually.  It's a great video.  Do you like the video?  I didn't like the one where, uh, the one with Beyonce, with the guy that put the...  They somehow co-opted Quentin Tarantino's pussy wagon in the...  Did you see this?  Yeah.  They drive in the pussy wagon, which, by the way, and I'm like a Tarantino fan, but you 
[03:38:30]  know he's just a weird dude.  And you probably wouldn't have fun hanging out with him because he's just...  It's too much.  Apparently, he rides around L.A. in that pussy wagon.  Does he really?  It's the equivalent of, like, Don, whatever Batman was, riding around the Batmobile.  It's like, dude, don't you understand, know you?  Yeah, it's...  If you're driving a Rambler, they would know who you were?  You know he's kind of a D-bag, if it weren't for the success.  Yeah.  What is this one?  This is Telephone.  Yes, this is the one with the pussy wagon.  Lady Gaga featuring Beyonce. 
[03:39:00]  Featuring Beyonce.  Oh.  Yeah, you gotta have a...  Look, they got, like, credits that go on the beginning.  Oh, yeah.  Well, this is a 10-minute video.  Jeez.  See, Michael Jackson started...  Michael used to do that shit.  Yeah.  With the Thriller.  She also did a video like this for Pavarazzi.  Remember when he did the Thriller and the kids loved that?  Yes, the Thriller.  We were talking about how putting the the in front of everything is so hard.  So all I'll do now when I'm talking about you like this is put the in front of everything. 
[03:39:30]  The Lady Gaga.  Have you seen this?  The Lady Gaga, people.  On the YouTubes.  Have you seen the YouTubes?  Comedians who pretend they don't understand pop culture so they can do...  That is so annoying.  Does anyone have the iPhone?  He does that all the time.  It's so annoying.  Does he?  Oh, Letterman always puts the duh in front of the...  Or an S at the end.  Imagine the, uh, the...  Yeah, yeah.  The internets.  Yeah, the internets.  Paul, have you seen the Lady Gaga, Paul?  The Lady Gaga.  She's getting naked.  Oh, wow.  What's she doing?  They took her clothes off.  Why did they do that? 
[03:40:00]  She showed her a bit of police.  Because they don't know what fucking gender she is.  Probably that giant, delicious clit.  They think it's a weapon.  Delicious.  There is something about her when she's, uh, gussied up in that fucking outfit.  When she's in the gussied outfit.  And all gussied up in, uh, in the outfit.  And, uh, that kind of looks good.  When she's wearing the pantaloons there.  Yes.  I like the pantaloons.  I like when she looks like it's, uh, 1890 at, uh, Coney Island.  And she's wearing, uh, she has a parasol. 
[03:40:30]  She got sunglasses made out of cigarettes.  That's insane.  It's crazy.  She is a crazy person.  Cigarettes are lit.  They're lit.  They're smoking.  And she's in the prison yard, but she's in chains.  Why?  That's, that's the symbolism there.  I don't think they'd allow her to do this in prison.  Because that's a weapon.  No, no, they would.  Yeah.  Do you think you'd get your ass kicked in a women's prison?  I would, yeah.  There's some girls.  There's some fucking, probably some serious girls in there.  Lady Gaga.  Oh, they're paging Lady Gaga.  But she's making out with somebody in the prison yard.  What is this? 
[03:41:00]  It's telephone.  The music video.  I don't like this song.  I'm not sitting here for ten minutes.  You don't like this song?  I don't.  I'm not.  I'm not a big fan.  I'm not.  I'd rather talk about Justin Bieber.  Yeah.  All right.  Let me get some hard-ons in this room.  I was just saying.  I was trying.  Yeah, let's watch something a little more feminine.  Justin Bieber.  I was trying to watch some of the videos there.  And, you know.  You got to get on board.  Do I?  Jim's on board.  She's looking a lot like Madonna there. 
[03:41:30]  With the eyebrows.  They say she's the new Madonna.  She's the new Madonna?  Then what's Madonna?  The old Madonna.  The 2000 and late Madara.  So, speaking of telephone.  So, I downloaded this Jim Norton app.  Do you have it?  I do have it.  99 cents.  I'm guessing from the quality of this thing that each cent of that is pure profit.  No.  The app is very good.  Hold on.  I don't want people to think they're getting ripped off.  I hired a very, very good app man to make my app. 
[03:42:00]  Andy's actually asking for more money back due to the undue stress he's going through right now.  There's punitive challenges.  Not just to read.  He actually was weeping openly during the commercial break while listening to it.  Oh, shit.  Oh, no.  She does.  She's got, boy.  I like her.  Yeah, I.  Penis.  Wah, wah, penis.  There you go.  That's 99 cents.  What?  No.  That's an app.  There's so much more of a high quality app that you're not understanding with that. 
[03:42:30]  Let me explain one thing so Andy doesn't make it look like all of a sudden my app is just childish.  First of all, 10, what is it, 10, 5% goes to charity?  Yeah, Craigslist.  Wait a minute.  No, there's, I have, there's also, Andy, 16 different ringtones.  Oh, my God.  See?  Where is it?  Oh, there they are.  Here's one you might want to.  It's easy to navigate.  What do you mean, where is it?  Wait.  No, I know, but it's right here.  Here's one of your phones. 
[03:43:00]  Easy to navigate.  When there's nothing to navigate, it's easy to.  Pick up the phone, cunt.  Wait.  You could do that.  Ring, ding, ding.  Pick up the phone, cunt.  There you go.  That's funny.  That's good, right?  Yeah.  Especially if you're in church.  How about the blowjob sound for your phone?  Oh.  Yeah, actually, Andy, you're really losing this complaint thing here.  Bill actually said he'd pay $5 to have it taken off. 
[03:43:30]  Well, a boo for Bill.  I'm going to have some sort of awful, uh, hold on.  Somebody just, we have somebody who is just apparently laying on the living room floor with  his cell phone.  Yes.  Let's get right to line 12 and, uh, Dana White on the phone.  Dana, how you doing?  Hi, Dana.  Good morning, guys.  Very good.  Wow, you just interrupted.  We were just going to do a break on a real man, Justin Bieber.  And, uh, apparently, we had to talk to Dana. 
[03:44:00]  Uh, wow, all right.  In the news again, you're, uh, you're quite the news whore.  Uh, you, you, you've let a couple of people go.  Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Uh, now, one, we, we know, um, uh, Jesus Christ, I don't.  Well, obviously, Kimbo Slice.  Kimbo Slice.  Here's the thing.  Kimbo's.  Jesus Christ.  I just refer to him as. 
[03:44:30]  Kimbo finally got into the, uh, got into the UFC.  And Dana, you had kind of trash talked Kimbo.  And then he went into the, uh, onto the ultimate fighter and he kind of worked his way into the  UFC and he hasn't performed that well.  And, uh, you cut him yesterday after the second EKO to Mitrione.  Why, why such a fast decision to cut him?  Oh, I, you know, I, I thought he did.  I thought he did well.  I didn't think he, uh, you know, he didn't perform, uh, horribly, but you know, the thing 
[03:45:00]  is with Kimbo is he took a shot.  He came in.  He, uh, he could have taken the freak show route and made money fighting, uh, real easy  fights.  He came in, he gave it a shot.  He took me up on my challenge and, uh, went on the ultimate fighter.  He did well.  Uh, if, if you look at how well, uh, big country has done and big country was one of his first  fights.  Um, I think Kimbo did a decent job.  Um, and you know, he, he just, I don't know if he's going to continue to do mixed martial 
[03:45:30]  arts, but if he does, he could, he could do it in the smaller shows and try to work his  way back up again.  But I got nothing but respect for Kimbo and the route that he took and the way that he's,  uh, carried himself and, and performed.  Well, you kind of, it's, it's weird cause you cutting him like you could have kept him  in cause he is something of a draw, but it's, it's almost like, well, he's not performing  quite up to par.  And instead of making just fast money with his name, you'd rather not have him there  if he's not going to, you know, if he can't compete, then he might as well. 
[03:46:00]  Well, you know, I'm almost saying that you're almost sacrificing some money, making a decision  that's not easy.  Yeah.  It's, it's not about that though.  It's about the sport.  And, and I do respect Kimbo for stepping up to the plate and coming in and, uh, and,  and, you know, handling himself the way he did and, and, and literally performing the  way he did, you know, at Kimbo's age and after having been a street fighter for so long  and coming into mixed martial arts and performing the way he did, he didn't, he didn't do a bad  job.  I got to give him that.  How did you tell him?  Did you walk up to him yourself or did somebody else, how did you actually break it to him? 
[03:46:30]  Oh, tranquilize it dark first.  After the fight, you know, we have the press conference and at the press conference, people  were asking, you know, the future of Kimbo.  You don't really talk to the guys after, uh, you know, some of the guys you'll bump into  here and there, and obviously the guys who go to the press conference.  So, you know, but this is no different than Kimbo's no different than any of the other  fighters.  You know, there's some guys who've lost a couple in a row or whatever the situation  is.  And, uh, you know, after every event, some guys stay and some guys go, it's, it's just 
[03:47:00]  part of the business.  So was he, do you think he's like really screwed up about that or did he kind of see it coming?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I, I, I, I, the tranquilizer dart.  Yeah.  I mean, if you look at the NFL, I mean, if you look at how many guys, you know, come and  go every year out of the NFL and the draft happens, I mean, it's just, it's part of  sports the way that it works.  And you guys had a great, uh, event, uh, obviously, you know, Shogun won, uh, by knockout  over, uh, Loyola Mishida and, you know, Koczek won over Daly and a unanimous decision. 
[03:47:30]  And then at the end, the sucker punch, I really haven't heard you address somebody.  I've heard you address things harshly, but you really seem adamant that Paul Daly is not  going to fight for you guys again, ever.  And, uh, here's the thing when you go in and fight, you know, this is a sporting event.  And when you go in, these guys go in and fight hard for 15 minutes or 25 minutes, whatever  it is.  And, um, Koczek, the fight was over and listen, there's been bad blood before. 
[03:48:00]  Lots of people have not liked each other and said a lot of things leading up to the fight  and during the fight and whatever it may be.  But when that fight's over, you know, and you're walking around and basically not protecting  yourself, you know, cause you feel comfortable and confident that you're, uh, you know, you  just participated in the sporting event and, and, and somebody is going to walk up to you  like a punk and punch you in the face after the fight is over.  Um, you know, and when somebody does, I won't, I won't tolerate that. 
[03:48:30]  And it comes at a bad time because I know you guys, it's ludicrous that it's not legal  here in New York and there are certain people trying to keep it out and their, their nonsense  excuses are that it's too rough, it's barbaric.  And you're showing that it's not.  And then every time something stupid happens, it just, it just gives them fuel, even if  it's not a reflection on the sport accurately.  Yeah.  I, you know, to be honest with you, I don't even think about that, you know, um, New York  or Toronto and things like that are the last thing that popped into my mind about that.  Listen, this is a, it's a, at the end of the day, it is a fight and, and, you know, 
[03:49:00]  these guys are fighters, so stuff's going to happen.  But let me tell you what, in my 10 year history in the UFC, you know, you deal with a lot  of things and, and, uh, but one of the things about the sport is the sportsmanship and the  way that these guys are, uh, what Bailey did the other night, I may be sick and, uh, he'll  never ever, I don't care if people consider him the best in the world three, four years  from now, he'll never fight in the UFC again.  Well, Kosciak said that he said something to him. 
[03:49:30]  He almost in some weird way went to bat for him.  Why do you think he did that?  Who did?  Uh, didn't Kosciak say that he had whispered something kind of nasty to Daley?  No, Kosciak said they were talking stuff to each other, you know, the whole fight.  Then at the end of the fight, Kosciak said, uh, you know, uh, you know, like there was  one minute left in a fight and Kosciak said, he was, he said, I'll let you tell him and  I'll let him tell everybody what I said.  But, you know, I said some things to him that weren't very nice.  So what?  Who cares?  I mean, so, so was Daley.  Daley was talking stuff too. 
[03:50:00]  And that, that was the whole buildup for that fight was those two saying horrible things  to each other, you know?  And Daley's had what kind of response to, since he did that?  Has he said anything publicly?  What's that?  Has Daley said anything publicly about why he did it or apologized?  I honestly don't know.  I haven't, I haven't heard anything.  I don't know.  What was that night after the fight?  I, I, when he did that, I went up into the octagon and, uh, I said some things to him  and basically I said, you know, why would you do that?  What are you doing? 
[03:50:30]  Uh, and he said, uh, I didn't hear the bell.  Then I said, what, do you, do you not want to fight here anymore?  And he just kind of shrugged his shoulders like, who gives a shit?  So if he had handled that moment differently, would your outlook on him be different or no?  No, no, no, no, not at all.  The, that's, that just goes to show where the kid was and what he thinks.  Listen, sometimes you'll, you'll do things out of whatever, you know, that, that kid could  care less, could care less.  Jesus Christ.  When you can't control, listen, if you can't control yourself after 15 minutes of fighting, 
[03:51:00]  which, and at the end of the day, I don't think the kid did a bad job.  I mean, he, he's toured through the 170 pound division, you know, uh, England isn't known  for their big wrestlers.  You know what I mean?  There's not a lot of wrestling in England.  He did a damn good job, uh, you know, wrestling with Koshchak too.  So, so to do something like that after the fight, it's just, it's, uh, I, there's no way  I won't tolerate that.  It's not going to happen.  Yeah.  You had some pretty, uh, pretty harsh words. 
[03:51:30]  And again, I've heard you say things like, even when you were pissed off at Brock, it didn't  seem like you were quite that angry, this guy, you, you really seem like you never want  to see him fighting.  Even if he was really repentant and came back and kind of did a mea culpa and said, look,  that was despicable.  Is there anything like behaviorally he could do out of the ring that might make you reconsider  somewhere down the road?  Now, when the fight's over, think about this.  You guys have been to fights and watched the fights a million times.  When the fight's over, the guys are done.  You know, you're tired.  You just fought.  You're walking around and you got your hands down. 
[03:52:00]  You're not protecting yourself.  You're not even thinking about fighting anymore.  Right.  And the guy walks up and hits you as hard as he can in the face.  You know, it's just, it's disgusting to me.  I'm not cool with that at all.  And there's no excuse for it.  And I don't care, you know, how long he thinks about it or how sorry he is about it.  Right.  It's over, man.  You might as well go get another job.  Wow.  When you're dealing with people, though, that like beat the shit out of people for a living,  you're going to have a few guys that do it not just because of the sport. 
[03:52:30]  In 10 years, it's never happened.  Yeah, no, I understand that.  But, you know, especially now that it's a lot more competitive, it's a lot more popular.  I think you're going to get people that, you know, you're going to have to handle because things like this happen when you're dealing with people that just enjoy punching other people in the face.  But they don't.  The reality is that's what's so different about the sport is that these guys are competitors. 
[03:53:00]  This is no different.  It's no different than if another basketball player walks up and punches another basketball player or whoever it is.  It's a competition.  And as soon as it's over, you know, you should have hit him.  You had 15 minutes to punch him in the face.  Yeah, right.  Legally.  You're going to be such a pussy that you're going to punch him in the face after the fight's over?  You know what, this is almost like a pitcher throwing a ball at a batter as he's walking to first after a walk. 
[03:53:30]  That would be a good one.  I used to do that all the time.  You're a catcher, Bill.  Or he hits a home run out of you, and while he's running to home base, you hit him with a ball.  Yeah, exactly.  You're exactly right.  All right, Farron, we have a guy on the phone, too.  He's a buddy of ours.  His name is Brandon.  And he's from a website that has been very, very supportive, I think, of MMA.  What would TylerDurtonDo.com, WWTDD.com.  Brandon, are you on the phone with Dana?  Hey, Dana.  I just wanted to ask you, against Rumble Johnson, Kovchak faked getting poked in the eye. 
[03:54:00]  This week he faked getting kneed in the face.  Is that – what is your stance on that?  Yeah, listen, when that happened that night, you know, we're sitting right there.  We have the monitors, and we're looking at it when they do the replay.  Yeah, it looked like it didn't touch him at all.  Kovchak said after – I said to him, I said, dude, you didn't look too good with your fake knee.  He said, I wasn't faking.  He said, the knee did hit me.  And he's saying that where he had that cut on his forehead was from the knee. 
[03:54:30]  So, listen, at the end of the day, I don't know.  The bottom line is, first of all, Daly did throw an illegal knee.  That knee was illegal too.  Whether it landed or didn't land, I don't know.  And for Kovchak to play it up and act like he was really hurt, or whether he was really hurt, you know what I mean?  I have no idea what to say about that.  That stuff happens sometimes.  That has – to try to compare Kovchak, faking, and illegal knee to what Daly did after the fight is insane. 
[03:55:00]  Well, that's almost like there was a fight, too.  I'm watching Ultimate Fighter this year, and a guy I like a lot.  He's kind of an aggressive shit-talker.  Casey, the guy's name is, who threw the knee at the guy when he was –  Yeah, Casey Escola.  And who is the guy on the floor who he didn't think he actually – did he actually hit that guy with the knee or no?  Again, when I was there that day, the day of the filming, you know, I thought it did.  But you need to have – we need to have the production going on like we do at the live event where you can do replays and everything else. 
[03:55:30]  And the knee on Saturday night, as far as I saw, in the replay, it did not hit Kovchak, but Kovchak says it did.  All right.  We're getting out of here shortly.  We are actually leaving the studio.  Quick – two questions, Dan.  One, are you any closer to landing, let's just say, a Russian fish?  Actually, from what I'm hearing is, he just signed a new deal with Showtime. 
[03:56:00]  All right.  That's you out of the picture?  Yep.  That's fine.  And how about Ultimate Fighter this year?  This guy, Jamie Yeager, is really, really enjoyable to watch.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, he's talented.  When we did the tryouts for the Ultimate Fighter and he showed up, that kid was so cocky.  It was unbelievable.  So, he comes in and he makes it through the interview process.  And all I remember was how cocky this kid is.  But as soon as he got on the show, he definitely started backing it up.  And you're right. 
[03:56:30]  He's fun to watch.  He's not only, you know, his personality and everything else, but he's a good fighter.  And so, we have a few more weeks for this show because Chuck keeps disappearing.  Does he stay for the rest of the show?  Because a couple of fights he's missed.  Is he going somewhere personal or is that a work-related thing?  Yeah.  No.  Chuck, actually, you know, we got him in to do this thing.  But at the time, he was filming a movie with Mickey Rourke.  Oh.  So, he had to miss a couple of days.  That's what he's doing.  All right.  And Tito is not fighting Chuck.  Chuck is not fighting Tito in the...  Who is he fighting? 
[03:57:00]  Chuck Liddell fighting.  He's fighting Rich Franklin.  And now, does the reason for that become apparent on the Ultimate Fighter?  Yes.  Everything goes down on the Ultimate Fighter.  And obviously, what about Tito and the domestic violence?  Is nothing happening there?  Because you actually said we may cut him.  We may not.  Yeah.  I haven't heard a word about it.  I'm kicking back to see what happens, you know, legally.  By the way, Paul, I've been farting a lot this whole interview.  So, everybody else, right now, Opie's out because he had a baby.  Anthony has his face under his shirt.  And the rest of the studio is just kind of staring off to his face. 
[03:57:30]  I think you just had a bust baby.  Yeah.  That was not even.  That was really bad.  Oh, my God.  What is the, Danic, we have to leave.  We're actually late.  It was like Kimbo after the fight.  What is the next event, the big plug?  What event are you plugging?  This month, more of the weekend.  Rampage, Jackson versus Rich Franklin.  Obviously, a fight everybody's wanted to see for a long time.  Yeah.  The Ultimate Fighter.  And finally, it's going to happen at the end of this month.  All right.  Great.  Well, thank you for calling in. 
[03:58:00]  We thought we lost you today.  But thanks for at least talking about this stuff.  That's why we love you.  Sorry about that, guys.  I appreciate the support.  Thanks.  All right.  Talk to you soon.  Thanks a lot, man.  Bye.  Bye.  See, he talks about stuff.  He doesn't avoid it.  He doesn't hide about it.  He never sidesteps any questions.  No.  Dude, that's impressive.  He never sidesteps questions.  He never sidesteps questions.  Billion-dollar industry, and he can kick people's asses.  Yeah.  How great is that?  Before we leave, I just wanted, because we were talking about it during the break, get  to that adorable Justin Bieber.  We go from UFC to Justin Bieber. 
[03:58:30]  He's so hairless.  Yes.  What a tussleable little head of hair on him.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  But the rest of him is very smooth, though.  I can't emphasize that enough.  Of course.  Yeah, once they start growing hair, get out.  Get out.  Not to quote Jim, but boo.  I mean, come on.  Boo.  He had some problems with an interview that made the news, and let's listen to a little  bit of it.  See what he says.  Okay.  Justin Bieber, sorry. 
[03:59:00]  Bieber.  Is German for basketball, true or false?  Is what?  Is German for basketball, true or false?  German?  German.  Sorry, that's the Kiwi accent going on there.  German, you know?  German.  I don't know what that means.  I mean, like, here, German.  German.  Is German for...  I don't know what that means.  Okay, don't.  We don't say that in America.  We'll make fun.  I like basketball, if that's what you're asking me.  Yeah, why not?  He likes basketball.  He's getting an attitude with him.  He did the right thing, though.  German, because he was trying to corner him into some racial stuff. 
[03:59:30]  He was like, is Bieber?  Is Bieber German for basketball?  And the kid didn't understand what the fuck he was saying.  Yeah.  It was like a trick question.  But in the interviewer's defense, he did show him the cue of the word.  He goes, see here, German.  See, Jew man.  Bieber does read it back to him.  He goes, German.  Yeah, that's the part, because I never got the excuse, because he actually, he does say  German.  He does say it.  He acknowledges the word.  The goddamn German's got nothing to do with it.  The kid's a fucking idiot.  How do you not know what German is at your age? 
[04:00:00]  It's because you're having threesomes every night.  That's what I ask.  Fair point.  Justin Bieber.  He's got little girls crying for him every night with his heart.  Now, is that something you like there, Sambo?  No.  No?  No?  No?  Actually, we don't even really play Justin Bieber on Hits 1.  I think they have a grudge or something.  Don't really?  Or you don't?  He's only, they have a list of songs that are hip-bound, not quite hits yet, that aren't  in the permanent rotation.  Did you ever have to front or back sell Justin Bieber? 
[04:00:30]  No.  Are you lying?  Because I don't do any hip-bound stuff.  All the stuff I do is in permanent rotation, and Bieber's not there.  If I hear you going, I'm mad with Justin Bieber.  You should hear his horrible radio voice.  Do your radio voice, sir, by the way.  That he uses.  This is what he does when he uses it.  Well, I don't know.  I mean, do we have some?  How about you introduce Red Eye today?  Because you've got the whole Beyond, and you've got Andy Levy and Bill Schultz.  Yeah.  You know, Sam does a radio voice really good.  I'll just hear it.  So you want me to kind of...  Yeah, sell it. 
[04:01:00]  How about a little bed?  Like, that would be kind of some of the music that he might play on the...  I've got to come out of a song.  That would help.  Like some Bieber.  Yeah.  I've got to come out of a goddamn up-tempo number into a dog dying.  All right, he's going to...  Travis is going to find the live version of some horrible song,  because he can never get the right song that we need.  No.  And it takes him forever.  He gets the original.  Oh, here we go.  Yeah.  I'm feeling this.  I'm feeling this. 
[04:01:30]  I'll let you shout it.  Sirius XM hits one.  Red Eye's coming up next.  What's wrong with that?  That's something you actually don't do.  You have to say more.  I enjoyed it.  I love the fact that he had to stand to do it.  He's not kidding.  He's not being ironic.  He's not being that...  He actually back-sells and front-sells songs like that.  You need high energy.  It's a different audience.  And he throws things in like his Twitter all the time. 
[04:02:00]  So Twitter me!  And they don't.  It appears that I'm being followed less now.  No!  Twitter me at helium.com.  That's not my Twitter name.  No.  Balls haven't dropped at Twitter.  It's not Ed either.  And he does like three shows.  He does the Sam and Dave show.  On the Saturday.  That's the Saturday night show.  Yeah, and then the other show he does for the music thing. 
[04:02:30]  And then he...  And the worst of the week, Countdown.  He just decides to drop by here and whatever lack of energy he has left, he spreads it  around a little bit.  That's not true.  He must be making a fortune.  Well, I don't discuss finances.  I find that vulgar.  Neither does the company.  Ikea furniture.  I'm still hurting on that one.  I'm like, dude, if I get a Comedy Central Presents, I'm getting some Ikea shit.  You haven't done a Comedy Central Presents yet?  No.  And you have no CD out?  No.  Jesus Christ.  Wow, Jim.  I am what you called a hit that button. 
[04:03:00]  No, but you should go, man.  And you don't have an iPhone app?  Al's very funny.  I'm surprised, man.  Yes, I've seen him with you.  I've got to get on that.  For anyone in Baltimore, Lazy Al will be at the Comedy Factory May 13th, 14th, and 15th.  You can go to BaltimoreComedy.com.  Al Jackson, he's a truly funny comic.  If you haven't seen him with me or other places, he's really a funny act, man.  And I appreciate it.  I need Twitter followers really bad. 
[04:03:30]  How many do you have?  It's in the 40s, Joe.  What's your Twitter name?  Al Jackson Comedy.  Can we fucking get on?  40-something Twitter followers.  Wow.  It's cool.  Hopefully, they're all in Baltimore.  Al Jackson Comedy.  Yes.  There you go.  And, wow, Jimmy Norton's going to be on Red Eye tonight.  Yes.  44 followers.  Jimmy with the boys.  Bill and Andy and Greg.  And who else is going to be on with Jimmy tonight?  Courtney Friel. 
[04:04:00]  Yes.  Fucking smoking.  Yeah.  Yes.  I mean, I don't know.  Ken Blackwell from the Republican National Committee, also smoking.  He's fucking smoking, definitely.  Yeah, you guys get some, like, really attractive women on that show, and it's so distracting  because you want to look, but you don't want to look like you're looking.  Because they don't wear those, like, those women in the media skirts and stuff with their  legs and the shoes and everything.  You've got to look, and it's so embarrassing getting caught.  We had this.  Touching their ass when they walk out. 
[04:04:30]  They always get in trouble.  It's great watching them finally get on board.  Like, when they're first on, they'll wear something, you know, kind of cute.  Second time, it's like, eh.  And then the third time, it's just, oh, my God.  Came right from Vicky's.  Unbelievable.  Has S.E. Cup asked about me?  Constantly.  Yes.  She's a looker.  Yes, she is.  She's very nice.  She's a looker.  Not one woman.  I've done red eye with every fucking hot chick they have on.  I've never gotten anything that resembled a vibe.  Really?  Nothing.  Do you try to hear?  I'm on every night. 
[04:05:00]  I don't care about it.  Just talking.  No, but I mean, just talking in the dress.  Do you try to hear?  I'm on every night.  I don't care about it.  Just talking.  No, but I mean, just talking in the dress.  Nothing.  Not one.  Do you want to go for a beverage?  Nothing.  I haven't tried.  Well, you're usually in the green room with your girlfriend.  Yeah.  Pretty hurt every time.  She's not there every week.  Also, Jim, this was pre-app.  Oh, look at that.  That's right.  Absolutely.  No, come on.  You talk about a game changer.  I mean.  Answer every single question of Greg's night with the app. 
[04:05:30]  And then they're done.  Oh, yeah.  Wah-wah penis.  You're the wah-wah penis.  They're going to be all over you.  Pants dropping.  And I'll be at the Borgata July 2nd and 3rd.  Yes.  Tickets are on sale now.  The Borgata.com.  My sweet friend, Anthony, will be there.  Of course.  Gambling like a maniac.  Yes.  Like an addict.  Exactly.  Like an addict.  Like an addict.  Will your friend, the pillow, be with you?  Yes.  I need my pillow to punch and to yell into when the dealer pulls a 21 out of a 14.  I love the fact that that's true.  Like, as Eddie told me, it's absolutely true.  I was screaming into it. 
[04:06:00]  They had to bring a pillow for me to just scream into it and punch it.  Because I was punching.  I was just wailing them.  I'm sitting there on a 20.  That is amazing.  With, like, with probably $30,000 for one bet.  Oh, my God.  And the dealer's showing a four.  There's a four on top.  And I got a 20.  I'm like, all right, go ahead.  Seven.  Ten.  You motherfucking 21.  You son of a whore. 
[04:06:30]  I hope you get.  And then a list of diseases.  Horrible diseases.  I am awful.  And then they go to deal again.  And I go, no.  I'm shaking this off.  You wait for me.  Like, that really got him.  Oh, I nailed him.  That one.  Oh, boy.  Straight balling.  Like, sometimes I play 21.  I get, like, you know, 22.  I'm like, what are we doing?  God damn, I hate Chip.
