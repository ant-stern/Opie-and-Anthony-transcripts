<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with a "worst of" compilation focusing on Anthony's harrowing experience hosting his girlfriend's family.  This included a detailed recounting of his late arrival due to his girlfriend's car blocking his, the discovery of a child's booger on his couch (leading to its disposal),  his struggles with the unfamiliar controls of his girlfriend’s car (including the radio stuck on Gwen Stefani), and a frustrated phone call to Opie from a Queens gas station stemming from issues with the gas cap.  Opie shared similar childcare horror stories, including an incident with his nephew and Grand Theft Auto.  The hosts discussed Anthony's disdain for children, his luxurious garage, and his obsessive gaming habits (specifically solitaire on his Trio), contrasting them with his online chess matches against children.  Listener calls offered advice and humorous commentary on Anthony's predicament. The show's move to a free XM channel and its unexpected gain in trucker listeners were also noted.

The show then transitioned into a segment featuring listener-submitted "worst of" moments.  This included Opie's disastrous horseback riding date with a large woman, an interview with Big Kev about his contributions to the show, and a lengthy discussion surrounding Erica and her gift of a "lesbian couch," complete with a black light inspection for stains.  Erica also shared her anxiety attack and the closing of her antique furniture store.  Larry the Cable Guy joined the show as a guest, engaging in conversations about his experiences with truckers, hunting, and observations on life across the country.  The segment ended on a sour note with Opie accidentally breaking a ceramic dish Erica had gifted them, resulting in an uncomfortable interaction and Erica's tearful departure; video footage of the incident was reviewed.

The next segment heavily featured Larry the Cable Guy.  A caller questioned a pre-chewed food sketch on Larry's show with Jeff Foxworthy, prompting Larry to express his disgust.  The discussion then devolved into various interpretations of "noodling," followed by a series of Larry's crude and offensive analogies.  Further calls led to discussions about Larry's audience demographics, experiences with difficult audiences (particularly uptight white liberals), and his views on politically incorrect comedy and controversial comedians like Bill Hicks and Paul Mooney.  The Blue Collar Comedy Tour, the lack of high-profile guests on the new Opie and Anthony show, Hooters, Wing House, and a bizarre call from someone claiming to be Master Poe were also discussed. Bull nuts and bull dick canes, "The Apprentice," "The Swan," NASCAR, and the perceived absurdity of political correctness were also mentioned.  The segment concluded with a discussion about Larry's career origins and experiences with radio call-ins.

The final segment began with a debate on the perceived lack of media outrage over a filmmaker's death, attributed to fears of association with President Bush's Iraq policies, contrasted with the leniency towards criticizing born-again Christians in Hollywood.  The hosts criticized Hollywood elites, specifically Barbara Streisand, for their perceived disconnect from average people.  This segued into discussions about airport security and racial profiling, followed by a reading of excerpts from "The Big Book of Boy Stuff," focusing on insults and outdoor hygiene, with explicit discussions of bodily functions.  Bart King, the book's author, called in, but the interview was plagued with technical difficulties.  A "Hi Mom" phone prank about being fired for masturbation and an in-studio interview with former NFL player Deacon Jones concluded the show.  Jones discussed his weight loss, racial prejudice, views on steroids, and an article in the *Los Angeles Times* he found mildly offensive. Jim Norton frequently participated in the conversations throughout this segment, and there were numerous technical difficulties with the phone lines.

[00:08:00]  me myself i have worked uh i had a real job you know i was doing construction i was in this type of  cold frigid weather where a house is nothing but two by fours and you got to put in duct work and  it's freezing cold and you don't want to be there and you're humping stuff and there's ice and it's  it stinks and i did that but you know something throughout life i have been afforded certain  things uh and now i just don't have to deal with certain things one of which is is pumping gas in the 
[00:08:30]  freezing cold i don't like doing it so what i do is i i keep my car garaged make sure it's full of gas  and uh then when i leave i don't even have to deal with the outside world only the little walk that i  take to the studio that's the only time you're outside all day pretty much yeah because all right  so your car gets uh warmed up for you right while you're well it's in it's in the garage but do you  have one of those automatic uh garage is like heated all right so so it's uh it i get in look

[00:10:30]  and you go oh and then walk away i i i could appreciate you actually do the google google no i think it  oh you know because i don't think anyone actually no no one does that okay it's it's it's do you have  a rattle in the back pocket where you just oh you see kids i i try to make believe they're not there  is what i do that's it and and and and they're staying over and um well this morning the the their 
[00:11:00]  vehicle was in my my driveway behind my uh my garage door so i could not get my truck my truck out  uh like you know i get in it's warm like so i had to take my my girlfriend's vehicle which is out in  the driveway in in the freezing cold by the way there's a trucker checking in from minnesota yeah  pretty much saying stop bitching about 12 degrees in new york it's a negative 48 in minnesota that's 
[00:11:30]  why i don't live in that frozen tundra minnesota no 12 is cold enough it's plenty cold after 12 12 48  does it matter does it really matter so i get i get in the girlfriend's vehicle and i have no idea  how anything works in it and it's pitch black and and i can't even i can't figure anything out and i'm  trying to drive now it's freezing cold in there before it heats up and i can't figure out the radio  so like gwen stefani is just blasting and i can't change that and i mean blasting and it's early in the 
[00:12:00]  morning and now i can't even i can't shut it off i can't change the station because now i'm really late  and i'm driving it's i am freaking out i can't adjust the mirrors i don't even know how to adjust  the mirrors so i can't see anything behind me i'm driving freezing cold loud gwen stefani now i'm on  the expressway you honestly couldn't figure out where the volume controls are i couldn't figure it's like 
[00:12:30]  it's like the glass cockpit of a brand new fighter jet there's no knobs there's no nothing it's all  touch screen glass screen thing oh yeah this thing is like the future i'm surprised it doesn't fly  oh sorry not loud enough it was blasting and i couldn't turn it down and there i am  hey here i am driving down the expressway how do i turn this down how do i turn it down 
[00:13:00]  oh my god i'm freezing oh stop i i can't take it i'm freezing cold  one thing i did hear though  low fuel low fuel  what what what my mule what are you saying vehicle i don't understand you 
[00:13:30]  i wish i could listen to 10 10 wins so i know what's going on for the show but i gotta hear quen  stephanie on 11 shut up shut up shut up shut up this is my drive in oh it's only it's only 
[00:14:00]  quarter to five in the morning i like listening to loud dance music at a quarter to five in the morning  stop please stop  yeah and then now now i have to stop for gas which is my nightmare early in the morning when it's 12  degrees out so so i i pull into the gas station and of course uh it sounds minor but when you ever 
[00:14:30]  been so livid that anything new thrown into the situation will just freak you out oh yeah definitely  i pull in and of course the gas cap's on the opposite side of my vehicle so now i gotta get  back in and i've already slid the credit card through so now i gotta i can't just go to the  other side i gotta kind of u-turn around and and uh i go to open up the gas cap i have no idea how to  open up the the gas thing and i am now and i'm just tick tock tick tock time is ticking away this 
[00:15:00]  is show prep time i'm picturing everyone sitting here ben herking at his computer hoping going through  the papers uh norton's still sleeping because he's not in until six so my girlfriend gets this call  from my cell phone she she picks up the phone  where the fuck's the gas cap release the thing shit 
[00:15:30]  oh baby i don't know i've never fueled it up  ah i'll find it damn it click that was my call to her at about five this morning  and you know what really ticked me off there is no thing you just do it with your hand  are you just serious pull the flap up with your hand but every new vehicle and mine has a little 
[00:16:00]  thing inside they went back to old school they went old school on me and it threw me for a loop  so now i i think the only saving grace is it was a self-serve pump with a little thing that keeps the  the gas flowing so you should never in the car right so no i could just put my hands in my pocket  while i called opie oh it's me i'm i'm putting gas in my car in queens really you thought you'd  announce that to me i was like why why are you yelling at me yeah like whatever dude all right

[00:38:30]  By the way, never found the booger  Nice  So now  Knowing you, you're going to throw the whole couch out  Much like Seinfeld  Yeah, I have to throw my couch out  I didn't even have to ask  I know if someone's looking for a really nice couch  With one lousy booger in it somewhere  With a booger somewhere  We should just give the address of where you're living  And they can come by with a truck and pick it up  Take it away free of charge  It's all yours  I know you, and he's not lying  Oh, I will have a new couch 
[00:39:00]  As soon as possible  That couch is gone  Because  First of all, I can sit on it  But I can only sit on an area that's nowhere near  The ground zero booger area  Right  And as far as laying down and reclining on it  Over that crack  You know, the modular crack that I was in  But do you realize what other stuff is on your couch?  Seriously  Have you had people sleep over and stuff?  Uh, yeah 
[00:39:30]  I got foreign stains on my couch  And I'm like  What the hell are people doing on this couch when they sleep over?  Really?  Oh my god  People, you mean couples are sleeping on your couch?  Um...  Because then they are having sex on your couch  Right, exactly  And making...  Yeah  Exactly  That is probably the rudest thing you can do  When staying over some of those  Especially sleeping on the couch  There's...  Bend her over the coffee table or something  That could be, you know, clean with some Windex  And stupid me, I got a very light colored couch  So everything 
[00:40:00]  You know, you got a brown couch  Eh, do what you want on it  I'll never see it  Yeah  But, you know, it's an off-white  Kind of thing  Mine's like a light gray with a green booger somewhere on it  But I have no clue where it is  Oh, that is gross, man  Yeah, people that stay over your house and do things like that  Having sex on your couch  That's pretty rude  Well, there was two, like, nasty spots  I thought it was the old splooge stains  Yeah  But I scrubbed and scrubbed and scrubbed  And they're still there  So now I'm thinking it might be just a little grease from Chinese food or something  Thank God 
[00:40:30]  You think?  Well, what else could it be?  It could be splooge  Nah, I think you can wash that out  No, no, that don't come out  There's that little border area of the stain that won't come out  Where it's kind of wicked to the side  And all the proteins and everything kind of  Right  Collected on the edge of it  Uh, Chris the trucker wants in on this  Chris, go ahead, buddy  Yeah, Anthony  Yes, sir  Can you hear me?  Of course I can  Hey, Anthony  Yeah  Chris  He can't hear me? 
[00:41:00]  Oh, come on  Buttons  Chris  Buttons  Yeah, Anthony  Yeah  Yeah, hey  That's the only one you know about  What about the rest of the house?  Oh, the kid  Yeah, maybe for two days  He had three kids there  Maybe they were wiping boogers everywhere  Yeah, hey  I got four kids  And I tell you  They do a little bit of sick of everything  Yep, time to find a new house, Anthony  Oh, my God  Time to get a maid service in there  And clean up the whole thing  There you go  You should have seen 
[00:41:30]  That's true, actually  There's probably boogers all over your house  Oh, my God  You should have seen my girlfriend going nuts  She  Like  She went around the house  With  Like  Disinfecting stuff  And cleaning stuff  And I was like  What are you doing?  She goes  Kids  With meat hands  Just touching everything  Like freaking out  She's a vegetarian  But, you know  Not crazy vegetarian  Where if she sees me eating a burger or something  She's going to freak out  But  The fact that the kids 
[00:42:00]  You know how kids don't  When they eat like hamburgers  Yeah  It just gets all over their hands  And then they're walking around  Like  Like touching stuff  And she doesn't want to be grabbing a faucet  You know  And just have this greasy burger juice  On the faucet  So she's running around like a mad woman  Tina  Clean this up  You guys are like  That couple from National Lampoon's  Christmas vacation  Margo and that other dude  Really?  Yeah, the neighbors  I don't remember that  It's all about just you two 
[00:42:30]  You don't want any kids around  We are  You don't want anyone touching your stuff  We are the most selfish people  What's the other guy's name in that?  Because I know the famous line is  I don't know Margo  Yeah  Oh, Todd  Todd?  You're Todd and Margo  Todd and Margo  From National Lampoon's  Christmas vacation  I consider myself like a generous person  When it comes to  Like what I have  Things like that  Then I'm fine  But we are two of the most selfish 
[00:43:00]  Self-centered people  When it just comes to  Our own convenience  And things  Like we enjoy  Just leave us alone  Any little  Any little  Shaking up  Of my daily routines  Just gets me  Crazy  You guys are  Better known as  Loners  Yeah  Pretty much  That's pretty much it  We have our life  And that's what we enjoy 
[00:43:30]  I don't want boogers on my couch  She doesn't want grease on the  On the faucets  Yeah  Well, no  The computer was pretty good  I think they knew that was pretty much  You know, off limits  That's my  That's my salvation there  Although I'm trying to play  Like Battlefield 1942  And  You know, he liked  The little kid likes watching  Which is fine  But occasionally  Like I'm  Trying to do stuff  And he's so close  That he's like  Bumping my arm 
[00:44:00]  And I'm trying to kill somebody  And  Like I miss  And I'm just creamed  Look over  Oh man  Maybe you shouldn't  Bump my arm  While I'm trying to kill  The  You were a gook here  You were in hell  For two or three days  I just know you were  Definitely in hell  Oh, the kids all left  You know, they all left last night  Yeah  And after they all left  I was like  Oh  What was that, a week?  Oh, that's brutal 
[00:44:30]  And my chick's like  No, it's, you know  Two days  Yeah  We're not like company people  I know, man  You don't have to tell me  You know, we have still two full rooms  That just have nothing in them  The living room itself  You don't even set them up for it  The formal living room  They're not even set up for company  Nothing  It's a wide, expansive carpeting  With nothing  The dining room  The formal, like, dining room  Nothing in there  And that's why they had room to  Ah  Just run and yell through the house 
[00:45:00]  So, uh  No, we're not meant for company  We're not built for company  And, um  That's just the way it is  Stay away  Yeah, we're like  We're very inconvenient to be around  Let's say hi to Tom in Philly  Tom, what's up?  Hey, boys  How you doing this morning?  Pretty good  Uh, I had a suggestion for Anthony  Uh, next time those little, um  Uh, shit stains come over  You're gonna have Opie come over  And, uh, kick one of them  In the, uh  Liver  You can't be kicking children  In the liver  Yeah, why would I do that, sir? 
[00:45:30]  Why would I do that?  Chester  Chester  All right  All right  All right  What are you doing downstairs?  Mike in Kansas, what's up?  Mike  Yeah  What's going on, Mike?  I can barely hear you  Why?  What's going on with the volume  On the phones today?  I just had a suggestion  For that, uh, couch  You could bring it into the  Studio there  And make a new lesbian couch out of it  The lesbian booger couch?  Yeah  Dude, it's one booger  Yeah, but that's quite enough 
[00:46:00]  One booger is all it takes  So, what did the guy say?  Uh, because finally the search had to be called off  He did  The search for the booger was called off  It's now a recovery  Yeah, well  The search and rescue was, uh, called off  Yeah, called off  And now it's just a recovery  Well, he just said  Well, uh, apologize to Anthony  And, you know, the kid says  I'm sorry, but  You know  But the booger's still there  But didn't the kid know where he  He put the booger there?  You know, kids 
[00:46:30]  He dug deep  And then he shoved his hand  Like between the crack and the couch  And then, uh, wiped the booger down there  So I guess when he looked for it  It had already probably  Like, come off  Ugh, I'm getting grossed out  And now it's like under the cushion  Mm-hmm  I'm sure if I look around  But I don't want to look around  Because I don't want to find it  That's something I don't want to find  The Opie and Anthony Show  Hey guys, hope you're enjoying the worst of Opie and Anthony  Don't forget, we'll be back live

That is correct  Opening day, Red Sox-Yankees  We'll be broadcasting live and, uh  Go Yankees  Oh, it's going to get crazy up there  Yeah  I think it's going to get crazy  I think it's going to get nuts  Insane, maybe  But in the meantime  We're enjoying a little break off  And we're going to talk about Dreamweaver here  Ah, my youth  Another foray into my youth in California  Southern California  I was, uh, quite the young horseman back then, Opie 
[00:47:30]  Quite the young horseman  I was like a cowboy  Can I break in?  Yeah, sure  You're going to explain all that during the bit  Oh, I know, I know  I wasn't going to really go into it  I was just kind of  I was kind of reflecting on the fact  Yeah, you reflected  I was looking back at my youth  My little cowboy hat and stuff  You reflected on the fact that you almost stuck a fat pig  Because she, she had a really nice voice on the CB  Stupid CB radios  Silly, silly boy  I was going to get some  Here's Dreamweaver on the worst of Opie and Anthony 
[00:48:00]  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony  Ah, Tony on Long Island, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey  Uh, just to say, talk about taking one for the team  I used to work for a, uh, company  And I dealt with a girl in Chicago  Who, she moved down to Atlanta  And so we got talking  And I'd just broken up with my girlfriend  And so one night we started having phone sex  After, uh, she gave me her home number  So I said, you know what? 
[00:48:30]  This is crazy  Let's meet halfway between Atlanta and Richmond  And find out, uh, in order to have sex for real  So I get in the car  It's Belmont weekend  I'm stuck in traffic  Bleary-eyed  Nine hours later  I get down to Richmond, Virginia  And I get out of the car  And she's like 350 pounds  And I'm like, holy shit  You didn't, like, ask those questions  Before you decided to commit to a long drive?  I was like, well, whatever  You know, I'd just broken up with a, with a girlfriend of four years 
[00:49:00]  I wanted to get one right out of the way  Just to, to have it happen  And, uh, I got down there  And it was just like, she was, she was huge  But I was like, I can't turn around without getting some  So I took one to the team  I don't get that, man  Oh, dude, that's awful  I won't, I won't talk to a fat chick  If she lives five minutes from me  Much less drive nine hours and acknowledge one  What's wrong with you?  Alright, well, here's the real shame  She was a real nymphomaniac 
[00:49:30]  And I wanted to get anal sex  So, uh, I flew down to Atlanta  And banged her in the ass all weekend  It was, it was, it was horrible  We're out in Buckhead  And there's, like, all these hot chicks  And there I am with this big pig, like  This bar in Buckhead  Oh, wow  It was horrible  Did she want to go out?  Yeah, she's like, oh, let's go out  So now you've got to walk around with her?  Yeah, it was horrible  She wanted to come to New York  And I was like, absolutely not  Cut it off right there  It's all about the anal sex  I've walked around Buckhead 
[00:50:00]  You're right  There's a lot of beautiful women in that area  And you walk around with a 350 pound girl  Because she needs to go out  You got on a plane to have sex with a barnyard animal  Congratulations  That's hilarious  You too, guys  Alright  I like when the honesty comes out on this show, man  That's, you know, something that reminds me a lot of, uh  Of the Dreamweaver story from years ago  I remember that  It was just, I didn't want to be seen with her  And, you know, it's self-centered  It's nasty 
[00:50:30]  It's probably not the nicest thing to do  But, uh, it was a girl that I met on the CB radio  Named to get Dreamweaver, of course  That's the music  Her name was Dreamweaver  That was her CB handle  The Dreamweaver  And what were you again?  I was Wrangler  That's right, Wrangler  I was the Wrangler  Because my job back then  Was, uh, on horseback  I would keep, uh, like, uh, stable animals together  And in their pens  And I was a Wrangler  You know, if any of the steer got out 
[00:51:00]  I would wrangle them back in  The Wrangler  I hope that's why you got that name  Yeah, there's many  So, that is why  So, did you use the CB radio to try to pick up chicks back then?  No, no  Was it for the job?  I didn't use it to pick up chicks  Everyone had a CB back then  It was, uh  It was all the rage  The mid to late 70s  So, everyone had CB  No one had cell phones, Opie  So, it was, you know  Breaker, Breaker 
[00:51:30]  Uh, Breaker for the Dreamweaver  You got your ears on?  It's the Wrangler  I'll be 10-10, 10-8 on the side  Dreamweaver  If you're out there  Okay, Dreamweaver  You're out there  The Wrangler's on the side  Out  But how did you start talking to her?  She just happened to be on the CB one day?  Yeah, I think I was trying to, uh  Get in touch with, uh  Somebody else  Mm-hmm  You know  Maybe my brother Joe  Hey  Flying Fingers 
[00:52:00]  You out there, Flying Fingers?  His name was Flying Fingers?  Yeah  Why?  Uh, he's a guitar player  Oh, okay  Yeah, yeah  Yeah, I know  Ugh  Hey, Flying Fingers  You out there?  And then, uh  One day I hear a voice over the radio  And it was, uh  It was Dreamweaver  It's Dreamweaver  And she, um  She almost had, like, an attitude 
[00:52:30]  Like, why am I talking on the bullhorn now?  Like, um, Daria  On, on, on MTV  You know, Daria  She kind of had that whole thing  So it was kind of a cool attitude back then  So I started talking to her  You know  Hey, Dreamweaver  This is the Wrangler  Well, where are you from?  Oh, I'm from, uh  Dana Point  Oh, I'm San Juan Capistrano  I'm, I'm right, you know  Down the road  Oh 
[00:53:00]  Well, I gotta go  Okay  How old were you?  And then maybe  Oh, God  Thirteen, fourteen  Yeah, thirteen  Uh, and, and, you know  We kind of, you know  Every night  When I'd get on the CB radio  She was there  She was there  You know, she was always on the CB  And, uh  We, we would talk  That should have been your first clue  Should have been  The first clue  Always on the CB radio  And, uh  I decided one day  That I was gonna ask her 
[00:53:30]  To, on a, a date  A date  But, you know  My term kind of date  Not your ordinary date  We're gonna go horseback riding  Cause I have, uh, horses  And that's what I do  That's what I do now  So, uh, you gotta, you know  Uh, Dreamweaver Tarangler  I'd like to know what you're doing this Saturday  Oh, nothing  Oh, okay  Uh, you wanna go horseback riding with me?  And you never met her?  Never met her  That's the key to the story  Okay  Never met her  Okay  Um, you know where, uh, the river, uh, bed, uh, splits in Capistrano? 
[00:54:00]  Yeah, I know that  Okay, I'll meet you there  And, uh, we'll go riding this weekend  We've got a bunch of hills we could go riding up in  Oh, that sounds great  Okay, Dreamweaver out  Okay, Wrangler  Over and out  I'll see you Saturday  Were you all excited at this point?  Oh, it's great  Cause you have this image in your head  What she looks like probably  Dreamweaver  Oh, the name  It should say it all  She's weaving dreams  Right  In my head  Right  Of what she could be  Dreamweaver 
[00:54:30]  Dreamweaver has to, has to be a hot chick, right?  Absolutely  Dreamweaver  So all day Saturday, all morning, I got up early  I washed two horses  Which, you know, it's quite a chore  And, uh, brushed the horses down  They looked great  Uh, take some saddle soap to the, uh, saddle and everything  Did you clean out their sheath?  No, I didn't clean out the sheath  Pulling out chunks of beef jerky out of there  I never understood the people that did clean out the sheath 
[00:55:00]  There was some stable  What the hell's cleaning out the sheath?  Dude, there was some stable whores  Uh, that used to keep horses around where we kept them  And they were girls, you know, in their teens  They had these horses  That used to clean their horses  You know, you gotta clean the hooves  You take this hook in your hand  Lift the hook up  And you're, like, scraping horse shit out of their hooves  Right  Clean it out  And then, uh, you brush them  You bathe them  You gotta clean their teeth  Sometimes, you know  And their ears  Uh, and then their sheath  This is a male horse 
[00:55:30]  You know, they don't walk around with their dick hanging out  All, all the time  It goes up into a sheath  Okay  That's on their underbelly  This sheath gets filthy  Oh  And dried up skin and dirt  And rocks  Get caught up in there  Yeah, all kinds of crap  Gets, gets caught in there  And these girls would reach up  Grab this giant horse cock  And just pull it out of the sheath  And start picking off all this dirt  As they're just, you know, talking 
[00:56:00]  Hey, what's up?  How you doing?  Does the horse get excited?  Uh, sometimes  Yeah, but most of the part  They're just looking around  You know, eating their hay  And, uh, getting stuff picked off of them  Just disgusting  No, I didn't clean the sheath  Just smelt it under your fingernails  It did  Some of these pieces were like beef jerky  Dude, when I was at college  Yeah  Are you done with the sheath part?  Because it reminded me of something  When I was at college  I had this roommate  Um, and his job on the weekends  Was to mate horses  Oh, yeah, yeah 
[00:56:30]  And he had to go to work  With a raincoat on  And his whole show  I swear to God  Oh  Because I, I don't know  But I hear like when they  When they, you know what  It's, it's unbelievable  Well, it's, uh  It's everywhere  And there's a lot of it  It's just calamity  Is it really?  Yeah, yeah  We, we used to  Have you seen horses?  Yeah  You've seen a horse just ejaculate?  We didn't do it like they do it now  It's very technical and stuff  Right  In a lab, you know  We just threw a horse that was in heat  Together with a stallion 
[00:57:00]  And they would go at it  And a lot of times  Uh, the, the horse would miss  But horses just  They're completely premature  The horse would hop up  On the other one  The stallion would hop up  On the mare  And if the horse's cock  Just like hit the thigh  Of the other horse  And it would just go  Spraying everywhere  And there's a lot of it, right?  Oh, yeah  Yeah, because this kid  Would, he had his special raincoat  And his whole job  Was to make sure  He got that, you know  Penis into her 
[00:57:30]  Right  And he'd try to put it in  And he, he would  He would get covered  With freaking horse  They'd get all worked up  And unless it's in  You know, if it's not in  It's going to go everywhere  What a job  So they would go crazy  You know, because  You know, in college, man  You're all hungover  And tired  And this was his job  You know, after maybe  Two hours sleep  He would get his raincoat  And go down to the horse farm  To mate horses  Yeah, that's right  Oh, boy  So  You're going to get  A piece of her, aren't you?  Oh, calm down  Oh, hey, hey 
[00:58:00]  Oh, Jesus Christ  I'm not going to race him, though  I'm just going to jerk him off  Very good  Just going to clean his sheath  So, all right  Dreamweaver, the horses are ready  For your little date, right?

[01:00:00]  All day  How long had you been  Talking to her  Probably about two weeks  I guess  About two weeks  Just talking  So we kind of got to know  Each other and everything  And she was into horses  And I thought this was gonna be  A great first date  I was gonna show  What a man I was  I even got some  Some home brew  This is the stuff  That the Mexicans  Used to make  At a stable  That was real close to ours  They used to take  These bourbon barrels  That they would get  From the distillery  Fill it up with  Three gallons of water 
[01:00:30]  And then roll it around  Every day  For about a month  And when you poured it out  You got  A gallon  Would come out  Of just  The strongest  Fuck you up liquid  I've ever had  In my life  Moonshine  So I had some of that  Maybe get  Dream weaver  A little  You know  Get a little tipsy  And stuff  Drink it out of those  Tin cups  Like the old  West guys  Used to do  Want to snort  You know  Keep it  Keep it with the  Old West motif  Well 
[01:01:00]  Get the horses  Go to where the river  Splits there  In San Juan Capistrano  And I'm waiting for her  Got there early  You know  You got butterflies  In your stomach  I did  I'm still looking  At everything  Making sure  Everything's okay  And off in the distance  I see a figure  Walking down the riverbed  And that must have  Been Dream weaver  Here she comes  But it's just a speck  Coming  And I can't quite  Figure it out 
[01:01:30]  Maybe the sun's  In your eye  A little bit  I'm looking  You see the silhouette  Right  I'm looking  She came in  Out of the rising sun  Yeah I was looking  As she's getting closer  I'm thinking  Well  Maybe the heat  Is  You know  Spreading things out  You know  How the heat waves  On the highway  Make the highway  Look a little wider  A little higher  Yeah  Yeah  It could get like that  Was it cold  Maybe she had a Parker  Maybe she had a something 
[01:02:00]  Even though it was  A very hot day  Right  Oh god  No  No  No  And as she got closer  I can't  Explain  My disappointment  I think I can explain it  With this  Wah wah wah wah  Wah  Dude  The disappointment  Is really coming back  To me now  I'm kind of remembering  How disappointing it was  I had this image  Of  This beautiful girl  That was going to come  And ride with me  And I swear  I was going to take 
[01:02:30]  The ride first through town  And then up into the hills  Just so people could see me  Right  With the girl I imagined  I was going to be with  And then your date was going to end  With puppet sex  It was just going to be crazy  You were going to be  Having sex on the riverbed  Having sex like the Marlboro man  I was just going to be there  With this hot girl  In a bedroll  With a campfire  Up against a tree  With my rabbit  And the river  And the river  And sure  And guns  And whiskey  And broads  And horses  And fucking  A manly night 
[01:03:00]  With my hot  Broad  Dreamweaver  The disappointment set in  At a hundred yards  I saw her big fat head  And her big fat face  And her greasy  Stringy hair  And her loose fitting  Bunt ridden jeans  Bunt ridden jeans  Yeah  The bunt wore away 
[01:03:30]  The jeans like  Your knees wear  Oh yeah  A little frayed  At the bunt  Yeah  I can't tell you  Because I had built it up  To something so huge  In my head  The disappointment  Was such a let down  Did you fake it  To like a big smile  Like hey  I don't even think  I don't even think  I did  I don't even think  I did  And perhaps  She was just as  Disappointed  Thinking I was  This Marlboro man  I was  You know  Mr. Macho  And there I am 
[01:04:00]  With my you know  Little skinny arms  And you know  Trying to pull off  The cowboy thing  But you know  I don't  I don't  She was fat  Very disappointing  So what did you do  I tried to say  Hey how you doing  With a big smile  And stuff  But it was just like  Hey what's up  I think the thing  The person that was  More pissed  Was the horse 
[01:04:30]  That she got  She got a ride  Looked at me like  Thanks  Thanks a lot  What was the Clydesdale  Busy  Yeah  I said  You know  How you doing  She hops on the horse  No ride through town  No proud ride  Through town  As I show off  This girl  I imagine  Just hair blowing  As people looked up  And went  Wow  What a beautiful girl  On that horse  And turned directly around 
[01:05:00]  Went down the river  Up into the hills  Took a ride  For about  I'll be honest  45 minutes  That was it  No bedroll  No fire  No hunting rabbit  No sex  I'd have had a bag of moose  To feed that bitch  Believe me  No rabbit  She'd have ate the rabbit  Whole  Fur and all  One bite  Darn her  Done  Yeah  And none of that  None of that 
[01:05:30]  Fun stuff I imagine  45 minutes  I just went like  We better get heading in  And I think she even asked why  And I said something  The horse  I think the one you're on  Was coming up lame  Or something  And you know  I had to get it back early  But I had a great time  Thanks  Dropped it back off  Where the river splits  And took the horse back  It was disappointing  I remember my father  Was all happy and stuff  And he said  Hey how'd it go  You know  It's like  Oh dad 
[01:06:00]  She was a fat broad  And she said something  That Jimmy said the other day  You know sometimes  You just gotta go hogging  That's what dad said  Yeah  You know he always had  Kind words of wisdom  Like that  You truly had the greatest dad  Yeah  You really had the greatest dad  And that was  You never saw her again  Did you  Nope  I think I saw her once more  I never  Never called  Like I'd be on the CB  You know  Hey it's the Wrangler  Looking for flying fingers  Wrangler  Looking for flying fingers  You out there flying fingers  Hey Wrangler  It's Dreamweaver 
[01:06:30]  Wrangler out  You just blew it off totally  Dreamweaver Wrangler  You got your ears on  Yeah unfortunately for you  I had my eyes on that day  And I saw what a fat pig you were  Yeah  Hey Dreamweaver  Got your pork chops on  Wow  Yeah so  I saw her one day  One night  At a party  At another stable  And she was  Singing around a campfire  With a bunch of other people  And we kind of just traded 
[01:07:00]  A passing glance  But I think  You know  She knew  That I was disappointed  I couldn't even hide it  Because of what I built up  No one would have lived  Lived up to that  Who was that girl  That was in Playboy  Years ago  Hef's like  First real celebrity chick  Barbie Benton  Remember Barbie Benton  I know her name  Where was she from  She was just  I don't know  Kind of hot  And she was in Playboy  Brunette  Centerfold  Yeah  She was in Playboy  That was my image 
[01:07:30]  It was Barbie Benton  Was going to show up  And if we'll find a picture  I'm sure we will  During commercials or something  Pop one up  Or someone send a link  It said  Kirstie Alley showed up  Yes  Yes  That was it  I expected Barbie Benton  I got Kirstie Alley  Breaker breaker  To the Wrangler  I know  It's the Dreamweaver  And I got my ears on  Breaker breaker  I look a lot like  Barbie Benton  On the radio  Where's Dreamweaver boy 
[01:08:00]  You're a hunting rabbit  I want a Diablo sandwich  And a Dr. Pepper  And make it snappy  I'm in a god damn hurry  And then there she came out  Yoo hoo Wrangler  Thank you nice lady  Nice ass  I'm just still disappointed  Now that I think  I know  I could see your face  It really hurt me back then  Unlocked and free for the masses  This is the worst of O&A 
[01:08:30]  So nice not having to bleep out the curse word  On XM's High Voltage  What a stupid name  O&A  Well as far as Opie's hairstyle  It's more Owen Wilson  And Anthony  Anthony is more Burt Convy  The worst of O&A  Big Kev is one of the main freaks  In the O&A virus  Hi Big Kev  I don't like freak  I prefer contributor 
[01:09:00]  That's the term that I like  Contributor  How did you get on the O&A show?  A friend of mine  Bursted into my office  Quite a number of years ago  In the first year of NEW  And said  They're doing a live television broadcast  Come on let's get a WOW on TV  And I said yeah okay  So we actually got a big huge vinyl movie banner  We wrote WOW on the back of it  And we got a  It was the largest WOW ever  On a live broadcast  So we called in  And you know  Took responsibility for it 
[01:09:30]  And the guy said  Well we're going to give you  Wrestling tickets for it  And I was like  Well I don't want wrestling tickets  I'd rather come up  And hang out in the studio  And so they allowed us to do that  And I went up  And I liked the vibe  The vibe happening  And I just started  From that point  I started  Wherever I could  Contributing  They needed kiddie pools  For one event  I called and said  I would get the kiddie pools  They needed  Something for another event  I called up and said  Okay I'll get that thing  And then from there  It kind of turned into  You know  Kind of an ongoing thing 
[01:10:00]  So Big Kev  Is the prop man  For O&A  That's  Well  In the early days  Yeah  I think today  I'm more referred to  As the resident geek  I'm the guy  Who brings in  The lightsabers  And weird and wacky toys  For the guys to check out  And  You're the comic book guy  On the Simpsons  I am the comic book guy  On the Opie and Anthony show  That's what I am  30 seconds  Tell me about Opie and Anthony  Everything that comes to your head  Don't hold back 
[01:10:30]  Irreverent  They hold nothing back  It's real  That's the most important thing  I think everybody needs to know  It's real  It's real  It's not  It's not a stage thing  They don't walk out of the door  At 11 o'clock  And they're different people  They are who they are  When you hear them on the air  And that's really  Really important  That everybody knows  Sell Opie and Anthony  To everyone listening to XM  That has never heard of them  This is real radio  This is not set up  This is not a bunch of fake things  And wacky sounds  And  Zoom morning type radio 
[01:11:00]  This is the real thing  You are hearing  The future  Of this type of radio  You're hearing it  You're here now  Get on board  Now  Now  Back to the worst  Of Opie and Anthony  On XM 202  I hope  All that makes me so hot  Hey Steve  Which bit are we introing here?

[01:12:00]  She went to some kind of garage sale  It was the crap that you would get  In a garage sale  Absolutely  Brought it all the way to New York  To get a little attention  And oh did she get some attention  Boy was she made aware of it  Cringe radio  Left in tears  Just played a poker chip bit  It's the worst  That won't be in Anthony  Well we got Erica in the studio  Hello  It's Couch Lady  Hi  How are you?

Is it one of those things  That's used for jacking off  Like in 10 to midnight?  No it's just a simple little dish  That he can just throw on the table  Oh and like chips can go in there 
[01:26:30]  Oh wow  This is like a housewarming  Wow  You haven't got a housewarming gift  Oh boy  So you gave Opie something  That is breakable  It's gay  I really  You know  Jesus Christ  Let's just grab some stuff  Why would you give Opie something  That he could perhaps accidentally drop  You could have washed it  Before he gave it to me  Jesus  This leftover dip in the  Dick part  Check the price tag on the back  Uh she spent $13.50 on me  Thank you  And then I got two beer pitchers 
[01:27:00]  For you guys  In case  Oh we might need pitchers  That's true  Hey I just grabbed some stuff  Don't wait  I don't understand  Don't be defensive  You're bringing us gifts  And we appreciate them  I'm going to smash this  No  He is the worst  What?  I didn't say anything  You are the worst  Wow now that's a nice pitcher  It is a nice pitcher  Is it glass?  No it's that hard plastic right?  It's plastic  Those are good to drink a lot of beer out of  If you're starring in Young Frankenstein  I thought it was glass  Alright what's that? 
[01:27:30]  What do you got over there?  Looks like a Claymore mine  What is that?  Oh I think it's um  Poker chips?  Poker chips  From a 1940's  It's poker chips that Al Capone used  You obviously stopped at a garage sale  On the way down to the air  Poker chips in a hat box  Oh they're in a hat box  Wow  Wow  You got any cards with those chips?  Yes  Oh let's have a little hand 
[01:28:00]  Just for fun  Poker chips  I could sit here now  And shuffle chips with one hand  Wow  Like they do on the World Series of Poker  That's just wonderful  This is good  I'll bet there's a gift for Jim Norton in there  This probably sat on top of a 60's style  Folding poker table for years  I hate my gift  What is that?  I'm sure it's a joke  Because they were ranking on you  You had nothing  What is uh  What's that?  My gift stinks  Oh wow 
[01:28:30]  Oh they're playing cards from the  Moshe  Moshe  Suck  Moshe Suck  Valley Railroad Company  What the fuck is this?  Wow  I guess there must be some more gifts in there  Now that's it  No?  Wait  You got a beer pitcher for Jim?  I just grabbed him for all of you to use  But what about Jim?  It's for everybody  But that's not fair  No these are for everybody  It's not necessarily  I mean  But I don't drink alcohol  Exactly 
[01:29:00]  Can someone open the window?  I'll take it back  Alright  Name of the game is Texas Hold'em boys  Ooh  You got chips and everything  Yeah  That would be great if uh  They weren't  That  That pack wasn't missing aces  Card with little cards  Are there 52 in there?  I don't think there's 52 cards there  Oh there's 52  I never brought these in  At least the other pack  Of cards is still wrapped  Yeah  Yeah I got one wrapped  One unwrapped  What'd you gamble  At the bus station  On the way here?  Yes 
[01:29:30]  And then this pack  Because there's four decks of cards  Both of these are still wrapped  Atta boy  I'd love to know where these came from  No idea  Where'd you get them?  The store  What store?  Her store  Someone probably bought them  I can't imagine why the store is going under  I just can't fathom  With little tidbits like this?  Little trinkets and knickknacks  Yeah you might need better stuff in your store 
[01:30:00]  Maybe that's what it is  Wow  You were selling this?  There's plenty of stuff in there  That was very nice  I bet  That's  Only the best for your pals  Huh?

[01:30:30]  It's a bit  Oh the cards have little trains on them  Yeah little choo choos  Choo choo  Well if you haven't broken anything yet  You might as well  Because it could be the first thing you break in the studio  You broke your mouth  But that could be the second thing  That's a good gift  You could have people over  You could put the dip in the one thing  And the chips in the surrounding dish  Well Martha Stewart  This is a very good suggestion  Alright well  This is lovely  Thank you  I'm done  There's your couch  Alright  Thank you for the couch  And the gifts  And uh

[01:33:30]  That it breaks  I could see where you'd be confused  Oh my god  You are the worst human  She's ready for her picture  With you Opie  I can't even look outside  No  Why  Oh god  Not even smiling at all  I can't believe you  I cannot believe you  You can fix that  A little glue  Opie look out the window  Look out the window  She's gonna cry  I'm sorry

[01:34:30]  It stinks huh?  It's fine  It smells moldy  I'm just tired  I don't care  Alright well  I like the lesbian couch  Thumbs up to the lesbian couch  It'll smell like  It has only one splooge stain  So that's good  That'll change  Were you trying to give her a thumbs up  Through the window?  How revolting was that?  Thumbs up  And she did  I'm with you  She's just staring into space  She's not even looking at you  No  I'm not trying to make up for smashing her gift  I just kind of tossed it to the side  And then it's shattered  I don't know  It's ceramic  And you broke it on purpose  And you giggled  Awful person 
[01:35:00]  Alright well  Your aunt's doing nothing but trashing those awful 1951 poker chips  Yeah see that's the difference though man  What?  Why don't you say what you were saying during the commercial break  How much you hate your poker chips  I said  And wish you had balls like me  That these days  Those chips stink  Nowadays you can get chips out of the same chips you play with in Vegas  You know who uses chips like that?  Third graders  They need a little weight  They don't have any weight for them  Right  They need some weight  These are the plastic chips you used to play with 
[01:35:30]  With like your junior high buddies  They're awful  You'd steal them from your parents and play poker  They are awful plastic chips  Give her the chips back  Yeah you got it  Why should I give them back?  Just tell her you don't want them  You might have to  Oh Brady's a good point  Tell her you don't want her stupid chips  Why do I have to be part of your rudeness?  Because you're like all brave or in commercial break  But I can understand  You know that something might suck and I might hate it  But I'm not going to  And Norton what about you? 
[01:36:00]  These gifts stink  They do stink  I don't want to be known as the bad guy today  I don't want to be known as the bad guy today  A hat box  The Lucille Ball hat box she bought when she was out with Viv  She got that from a garage sale  A little stupid hat in the box  Yeah  Now take it back Lucy  Now Anthony  That's what it looks like  Call her back in here  But I understand I can get a bad gift and still be nice  And not hurt people's feelings  Call her back in here and give her her gift back  Why do I have to hurt someone's feelings?  I will not bow to peer pressure and hurt someone's feelings  Call her out on her gift 
[01:36:30]  I will tell her her gift sucks  But I will keep it  Oh you will huh?  Yeah  Let's see Anthony say that  You're really not coming back in here  Are you insane?  Hi Erica  I just wanted to say  Opie had a little mishandling of your gift  He bobbled it a little  While he was trying to put it over by his stuff  And it broke  But I have the cards and chips  And thank you  You guys  I know  I know  Anthony tell her  Throw them out  You hate them 
[01:37:00]  I don't care  What?  Tell her  Don't bother me  What?  Are those good chips?  I'm not saying that they're bad chips  Are they good chips?  They're old  They're probably from the 70s  I just grabbed them  70s earth mama chips  70s earth mama muff chips  It would have been cool  If it came from Frank Sinatra's house  But obviously it didn't  You know  They could be worth money  You don't know  I don't know  If they weren't money  You'd be getting married  You know  What's wrong with that?  Nice  That's a genuine wood chip holder 
[01:37:30]  Isn't it?  Give me those chips  Look  Give her  Give Obie the chips  I'm just thinking  I like them  I really do  But I'm thinking  Maybe somebody else  Could use them  More than I could  I'd be more than happy  To take them  And throw them  In the trash  For you  No  I'm not going to  Throw them in the trash  But perhaps  Somebody could use them  Tell her  I'll take them back  Anthony  Just give them to me  Tell her  She's yelling  Tell her  I'm trying to be nice  What do you mean  Why am I being yelled at?  You play Texas Hold'em  Why can't you use those? 
[01:38:00]  Well  They're just not  Quite the type of  Equipment I like playing with  What kind do you like playing with?  They're chips and cards  Well  Different cards  And different chips  People play with different types  Yes  I'll pass it back  Just give her the chips  Just Obie  Give those to her  And  It's heavy  These are the cards  That are still  There you go  They're all wrapped up  See they're still wrapped  They're all wrapped up  You ever play 52 cards  Pick up  Oh jeez  Obie  There's no reason  I eat  The cards had her

[01:40:00]  He's still immersed in it  It's fine  He can laugh  I can't even talk to you  That is horrible man  I knew from the start  It was a bad idea  To bring those in  In the first place  I should have just  Brought the couch  And be done with it  That is horrible  Look  I didn't have a problem  With him  Or anything  Oh for some reason  I don't understand  Why he's got to be like that 
[01:40:30]  Oh my god  It hurts  I apologize  For the actions  Of some of the people  On this program  You know  Enjoy picking up  Your poker chips  Thank you  You guys can finish  Your show  And talk about me  And do whatever you want  I don't care  There she goes  Wait wait  She's walking away

[01:41:30]  And rolled them across the console  It was a heavy thud  And they rolled  And all just fell off  And the chips are flying out  And the chip carrier  Fell on her foot  It's just  It was the most horrible thing  I've ever seen one person  Do to another  That's the biggest laugh  I've had on the show  I couldn't breathe  You are an awful person  I literally could not breathe  I was laughing so hard  I don't know how you do that  That just makes me so happy  Those are things you think about doing sometimes  But no human does them  But Opie just stay  I'll break your bowl 
[01:42:00]  I'll throw the chips at you  I'll fling the cards at your face  These chips have coffee stains on them  These are awful  See now you're brave  I can't be brave  Holy S  The back of my skull hurts  I laugh so hard  Eric from Jersey  The sound of plastic chips  Raining to the floor  Is the saddest sound  I've ever heard  It will be like  The sound of the thousands of tears  She's going to shed in the car  Yeah  Just walk outside with Ben  Ben's talking to her right now  Yeah  Gave her a nice garbage bag  Full of Ornay stuff 
[01:42:30]  She is bawling  Crying  Oh my god  See  I knew it  Here's what she said  She goes  I don't mind if he broke it  But he threw it at me  Oh no  And she turned her face  Into the wall  Near the elevator  And  That's all you're hearing  Stop it  You are horrible  Cringe radio is back  Boys and girls  It's about effing time  She threw the chips  I didn't throw him at her 
[01:43:00]  Hold on a minute  He's being smoothed over  He actually didn't throw him at her  I'm going to go check now  I was a very good athlete  When I was growing up  And trust me  I didn't throw him at her  Go fix that  I made it very close  Go fix that  Oh my god  Oh that's awful  I cannot  I cannot believe that  I'm horrified  Alright  Opie has no soul 
[01:43:30]  Evil to the core  Yeah  That's what they're writing  And I wonder why I'm alone  Opie is the effing antichrist  And I wonder why I'm alone  I go home alone every day  And I wonder why  Why am I alone  Jesus  Can't figure that one out  You made her cry  I didn't want her to cry  She was nice  And she tried to be good natured about it  I know  She tried to take the ribbing  It was the loud  The loud chips falling  Before the thing rolled off the console  I know  That was a big bet 
[01:44:00]  I'm all in  I will splash the pot  Whenever the fuck I please  Dude  You gotta read something  To the end some feedback  This guy Cody from Buffalo  Opie put some good force  Into throwing those chips  Sounds like some South American ring stick  No that's  I was horrified  During that whole thing  An update  Yeah  Ben's calming her down  Steve's out there 
[01:44:30]  They're getting her to breathe  And calm down  And they're gonna try to see  If she wants to come back in  And get her picture  Yeah  Cause she wanted pictures and stuff  Tell her if she cleans up  Say you're brave without her in the studio  That's the difference  I admit it  That's the difference between you and I  Say that to her face  I've done enough  How did you've done enough?  I think I've done enough  I can't 
[01:45:00]  I don't know  What's going on out there?  It's just  It's not  It's not fun  You threw it right at her  I didn't throw it right at her  Do we have the videotape?  You didn't get that on videotape?  Yeah I did  You got that on videotape?  It kind of rolled  On the console  I kind of just rolled it at her  She had plenty of time  To get out of the way  Oh jeez  She's a little upset  Yeah I would guess  Drove all the way here  From Rhode Island  Just to give something to the show  Yeah  Want to get her photo  Oh my god 
[01:45:30]  She comes here to give something to the show  And get a picture with Opie and Anthony  Maybe she should have  Gave something to us  From this decade  Who are you to say  That our gifts aren't good enough?  You know what  He raised frankincense  And myrrh  Not a good enough gift Opie  We're starting a rule on this show  You bring gifts  Don't get them from a garage sale  That's all we have  You know baby Jesus  His best gift he got  Was a song  From a little drummer boy  That's right  Opie  It had nothing to do with materialism  Had nothing to do with the  Gold 
[01:46:00]  Frankincense  And myrrh  Might have been good gifts  But  The little drummer boy's song  Was the best gift of all  And I'd have taken that  Over those lucky chips  Alright let me see the video  Alright here's the video  We're looking back at the tape  She's all smiley  Steve I'll need a screening  When you're done there  Oh my god  Well you kind of missed the toss  But you got the aftermath  I wasn't really expecting you to do that  Oh gee  What did you think you were going to do  Play a hand?  It's like catching a UFO  You're just not expecting it 
[01:46:30]  Wow that's  Well look at Norton  This is going to be great  For foundrymusic.com  I'm all in  Show Anthony  Alright bring that over here  I got to see that  I think the audio  Will really help that clip  Because you were too close  On her face  But all you see is  The chips go flying by her  Alright well  Alright let me get a look  Alright there's Opie  With the devious smile  On his face  She's talking  Still yes  Smiling  Oh my god  No that's 
[01:47:00]  Oh you see it clearly  You see the chips  Flying by on the table  Yes Ben  Not as if we've done enough damage  To being in this new building already  There's people just coming to work  Getting off the elevator  You see this all going on  In the hallway  And are just mortified  Oh they see her crying out front  Him filming it  Not even trying to comfort her  Could you face this way  When you break down emotionally  I'm horrified 
[01:47:30]  I am horrified  Yeah I'm not going to fix this one  See this is the type of thing  The barrier that people say  You know how far do you take things  On satellite  That's where you know  I think the line should have been drawn somewhere  Yeah  Girl just trying to bring some gifts  To the show  I definitely  Give me those I'll pass him  What what  Give me those I'll pass him to her  You're horrible man 
[01:48:00]  That clip is hilarious  You can see her face  I mean in the background  You can see the chips  Just flying by on the table  Look at the construction workers  Looking at them like  What the hell is going on in there  Alright well  Should we take our last break  And then regroup here I guess  I think yeah  Yeah  Oh that was great  I uh  I should go out and take your picture with her of  Yeah  Old fan from the AF days  She's been a fan since  The AF days  Whatever  First time in ten years  She's going to meet us  Go buy Demento World  And shut up 
[01:48:30]  No she's uh  She's a nice lady  The virus is now free  I'm an ass  Because nobody would pay for a virus  You better recognize  This is the worst of O&A  XM's high voltage 202  Ha ha ha ha  O&A  Opie and Anthony  In the XM food chain  Are somewhere between the CEO  And the lady who cleans the urinals 
[01:49:00]  And she's really nice  But they're uh  Opie and Anthony are finally free  On XM202 High Voltage  Satellite Radio  XM Satellite Radio's  Bruce Kelly here  With another Opie and Anthony  In Iraq  Opie and Anthony  A lot of fans have followed you  From uh  From uh  Stinky FM  To XM  Mmhmm  And uh 
[01:49:30]  How have uh  How have they reacted  To the entire uh  XM platform  Well they haven't checked out  Any of the other stations yet  They're so loyal to us  They just listen to us  24 hours a day  Yeah  So I guess we should tell them  There are other fine channels  On this  On this thing they call XM  Yeah they can switch over  Here's some music maybe  Maybe some other comedy  That isn't us  Sure have fun with it  They've been  They've been pretty cool  I think they got a big kick  Out of the um  The language  You know the freedom  You get to say uh  Certain words  Or just content and stuff  So they were pretty happy  With that  Um  I don't think it's that big 
[01:50:00]  A change though  As far as the show goes  On the whole  You get pretty familiar with it  Nothing really big  Not that big a change  Did you just go for  A serious answer to a question  No  That was a very serious answer  Oh sorry  I didn't mean to  It's a valid point  Fell into it  We don't really care  What our listeners think  Yeah  That's true  We don't even care  What anyone thinks  In this room  It's all about you  I just care about  How late that clock is ticking  We've actually lost  A lot of listeners  To the 80's channel  And Bob Edwards  Dr. Laura and our  Art and us are going to  Do a little cross promotion  Have you seen Bob Edwards

[01:54:30]  But they were syndicated  Their show on XM  And I think it was  The Truckin' Bozo  He's on XM  Oh we've heard about that guy  Yes we did  And he's great  I love the Truckin' Bozo  So I go on Truckin' Bozo  I'm supposed to do like  20 minutes with him  I end up staying with the guy  I went to the studio  At like midnight  You know  I end up staying with him  Until 4 o'clock in the morning  And I did a show  In Dayton, Ohio  The next night  Seven big rigs  Showed up  They were in the area  And they heard it  And seven big rigs 
[01:55:00]  Showed up to the show  And just parked out there  In the parking lot  Fucked it up  So no one else  Could park  Exactly  There were seven people  In the crowd  There was only seven people  But them truckers  Had to get down  Did you do any hunting?  I see you got the camo on  You know what  I went bird hunting  A couple weeks ago  But I didn't get nothing  No?  I don't think I'm  Throwing the dogs up high enough  But I got in trouble  In Montana  I shot an elk  Yeah?  At the Elks Lodge  And they didn't take  Right to that either  So 
[01:55:30]  Gotta watch out  For those Asians  Now when you're hunting  Oh my god  That guy up there  The Asian guy in Wisconsin  That took out six hunters  Yeah  You believe that?  Yeah  Seems there was  Who knew there was  A problem up there?  They had some Asian hunter  Like battle  That's been going on  For years apparently  Well that's true  Well I guess  That happened six miles  From my girlfriend's  Hometown  And she was kind of scared  Because her brother  Her dad  And five of their buddies  All went to their 
[01:56:00]  Private land hunting camp  Up there  And I called her  And I said  Hey did you hear about it?  And she goes  No way  So she hung up real quick  Called to make sure  Everything was fine  But I mean that's crazy  A bunch of good old boys  Get jumped by  An Asian  One Asian guy  Well look  Next time you're going  Through the woods  And you see an Asian guy  In a deer stand  Wearing the wrong kind  Of camo  And a SKS assault rifle  Get the hell out of there  The only thing an Asian  Should be doing in the woods  Is massaging you  And jerking you off  Behind a tree  I agree with that 
[01:56:30]  I got no problems  Larry's with you Jim  He's with you  I went up there  For Thanksgiving  And by the way  I ate too much  I'm starting to have to buy  Relax fit condoms  At least I'm gaining  In the right places  Right  But I go up there  And my sister-in-law  Is up there  And she just got  All them piercings down  You know  In the area  Yeah  And y'all can tell  When she's coming  You know  Because she always  Wears a skirt  And she's got  It sounds like  A wind chime  Headed you away  But she got

[02:00:30]  Part about it  Cause I was sitting  There eating  Some of my wife's  Spaghetti and meatballs  And I just about  Lost it right there  Well I gotta tell you  I said  And you can ask  My buddy that's with me  I said  Look that's too gross  We cannot air it  I think that's  Too gross to air  And so what we did  Was we ran it back  For the crowd  And Jeff goes  Well I'm gonna ask  The crowd  And he goes  Listen here's a bit  We did  It's up to the audience  If you think  We should air it  Then you'd let us know  And they said  Air it air it  Of course  Of course  It was all a bunch  Of college kids  Yeah yeah  I think we should do that 
[02:01:00]  On the show  For my fight  I got one more  Super quick questions  For Larry  You guys are never  Quick in Oklahoma City  Are you kidding  Yeah you know what  Tulsa spell backward is  Asshole  No a slut  You know what  You know what  A slut backward is  A hundred dollars  Larry  You know what  Noodling is right  Noodling  Yeah  Yes sir  What is it  Explain it to them guys 
[02:01:30]  I'm out  You guys have a good day  Alright thank you  What is that  Well from what I understand  Noodling  I think noodling  Isn't noodling  Sticking your tongue  In the butthole  Or something  I don't know  That's what I  Sure  Jim  That's what I thought  It was  Jim you're an expert  On that  I don't call that  Dinner prep  No I think noodling  Is drunk sex  No  I don't know  See I've never heard  The type of noodle  See now I thought  That was tossing salad  But certainly  I've heard the tossing  The salad  Somebody told me  It was noodling 
[02:02:00]  I don't know  There's different terms  For different things  All across  But that's what  I heard it was  I'm probably dead raw  On it  I don't eat mass  Tim in Jersey  Tim what's up  Hey what's going on  We're hanging with  Larry the cable guy  He's doing the  Foxworthy roast tonight  Yep  Oh excellent  Hammerstein ballroom  Larry can you do  A couple analogies  I heard them the other day  And I was laughing  My balls off  Oh yeah sure  I was more frustrated  And a pervert with palsy  Trying to draw a vagina  On an etch-a-scat  Mattered Jesse Jackson  At the airport 
[02:02:30]  Having to answer  The white courtesy phone  Tripping and stumbling  Like Ray Charles  Walking through a pumpkin pack  I was going down  Like Barney Frank  In a cheap motel  I like that  Mattered in a legless Ethiopian  Watching a donut  Roll down a hip  I mean a lot of them 
[02:03:00]  Mattered in an Amish electrician  I don't know  Now the truckers  Are coming out of the woodwork  I love the truckers  Roy what's up  You know what noodling is  Yeah it's where you go  Catfishing with your hands  You catch them with your hands  Oh see I thought  He was being dirty  See  Yeah  But when  We used to go  Nemaha River  And we used to go down there  And punch them  You go down there  And those big catfish  Now tell me  If you've heard of this  What's his name 
[02:03:30]  Roy  Roy  Now that new  That's when you go down  In the river  And you punch your hand  In the catfish mouth  And bring up the catfish  Is that not noodling  I don't know if it's legal or not  I guess in some places  It's not legal  But  It doesn't matter if it's legal  Is that what noodling is  Where you punch the catfish  Yeah that's what noodling is  Yeah  It really is  Yeah they build these boxes  And sink them down in the river  And I guess the catfish  Is laying in them boxes  And wait for food to come to them 
[02:04:00]  Well then  These guys go back to those boxes  Stick their hand in there  And catch the catfish  Yeah but that  We just called that  Punching catfish  Just punching catfish  See I heard that noodling  Was licking some girl's butt hole  That's what I heard it was  Put a little noodling  And then go out  And punch some catfish  Maybe it's licking a catfish  But I was going to say  That's a lot different  Than licking ass  I got both of them mixed up  Yeah that's a lot different  Than licking ass  Playing with an ass  Punching a catfish  It doesn't matter  Your fingers smell the same 
[02:04:30]  They really do  Either way  It looks like you got out  Of the WNBA locker room  Oh good lord  We just had some trouble  Here recently  My neighbor come over  He's all upset  Apparently his nephew  Just got kicked out of school  Down there in Florida  For having sex  With his 10th grade teacher  And the funny part is  He's homeschooled  So we were all upset about it 
[02:05:00]  A little upset about that  Vanilla Thunder from Philly  What's up Vanilla Thunder  What's up man  For my fly  I'd go to a  Larry the Cable Guy concert  In blackface  Oh  That would be a little rough  Yeah  What do you want to do that for  All right  Is it all rednecks  At your shows Larry  Hell no  You know what  That's a misconception  That's why I'm asking  There are all kinds  And I'm going to tell you what  The black crowds  Yeah  Laughed 
[02:05:30]  I went on Steve Harvey's show  In Los Angeles  And we had the best damn time  Because I do good  The black guys really acknowledge  That Steve Harvey is black  Oh yeah  Let me tell you something  I have  And it's  You know  I have all different kinds of crowds  That come to my show  And just because I talk this way  Don't mean it's just all rednecks  Coming to my show  I mean it's everybody  And I tell everybody  The worst cries to perform for  And Jim Norton will tell you this too  I like  I don't care who's coming to my show 
[02:06:00]  As long as you like to laugh  But the ones that are the most uptight  Are those real rich white liberals  Absolutely  And they have to analyze every joke  Before they can laugh at it  They're the first  That's what I always say about that  Like I'll do a joke  Like I'm on stage  Every now and then  My shadow will be behind me  And I'll go  So then I was  And I act like I'm scared  And I look and I go  Oh good lord  I thought a black guy  Was sneaking up behind me  Right  And people laugh  And you know what  And I do that  Because  The black crowd 
[02:06:30]  Loves that  I think it's the funniest damn thing  I've ever heard  But you look at these uptight white people  They have to look around  To see who's laughing at it  And they just pissed me off  And those are the same people  That'll come up to you  That was a racist joke  Then they'll get in their car  And they're the first one  To lock their door  When they go down  To a bad part of town  Absolutely  You know what I mean  Well they have some sense  Yeah  It's ridiculous  They're afraid that laughing  Is like a win  Because they really are  Real condescending paternalists  Racists  And they're afraid that by laughing  That's an acknowledgement  Of like oh yeah  I really do feel that way  It's insane 
[02:07:00]  It's insane  But no  I love all my crap  Whoever comes to see my show  They're just going to laugh  And we're all going to have a good time  And forget about it  Early on it must have been a lot  Of just rednecks in small clubs though  Well you know  I built my following on radio  I used to do very politically incorrect  Social commentaries  Right  And I mean I would just say  Hey this is  Because I'm not  I deem myself as a regular dude  I'm just you know  I go home  And I do like  You know  I'm riding a horse  I'm four wheeling  I'm going down to Hooters  I'm hanging out with my buddies 
[02:07:30]  I'm shooting pool  I mean I'm just a regular guy  Like they are  So when it comes to politics and stuff  I'll just say it the way I feel  And you know  I like it  And kiss my ass  You know  That's it  But the main part of it is  You want to be funny  You're a comedian  So you just try  It's like when I tell everybody  It's like  Bill Hicks was a buddy of mine  He used to  Love Bill Hicks  He's my favorite by the way  Of all time  He used to date my ex-manager  Colleen  And  But I didn't agree with one thing  I'm pretty right-wing  Right  But I didn't agree with anything  He said  Yeah he was pretty out there 
[02:08:00]  Politically  But I went to see Bill Hicks  Because he made me damn laugh  The guy was freaking funny  Yeah I'm the same way  Exactly  And that's what I tell everybody  And people go to a show  And they'll be pissed off  And go  What the hell you going to a Bill Hicks show for  Right right  People are just insane  They'll go see stuff  His comedy was brilliant  Absolutely brilliant  Oh yeah  He was  He was insanely funny  You know  I mean he would take his time  On that stage  And there would be silence  Because people were just listening  Yeah  You know  You guys know  When you do a comedy show  There's a lot of uptight people 
[02:08:30]  In the audience  They need to laugh  Every two minutes  You know  Yeah people gotta realize  They're at a comedy club  You know  And that's the one place  You can go  Set aside all your problems  And have a good time  But yeah  Them politically uptight white crowd  Piss me off  But the majority of them  Are real good  Audiences seem to think now  And this is the part of the problem  That they're part of the creative process  And they have to agree with your ideology  To laugh at it  And it just  It makes you want to bite somebody's face  Like I don't agree with anything  Paul Mooney says  But I'll still laugh watching him 
[02:09:00]  Because he's a good comic  Man he's the biggest racist  Fine  Let him be  As long as he's funny  I don't care  You know what I mean  I'm weird  Remember we interviewed  We interviewed Paul Mooney  Man  I thought we were going to get killed  There's some people  Yeah I get pissed off  That I am laughing  Because it's like  God I hate what this guy's saying  But it's funny  It's so funny  That I can't stand him  That's alternative comics  This is the problem  With alternative comics  They don't have the gift  Necessary  To make their political opinions funny  So they're like  Well we're just doing something different  Because they're not talented enough  To make it  Look at how funny is Mark Maron  I don't agree with anything he says 
[02:09:30]  But he's a funny guy  He's a good comic  Are you talking about  Janine Garofalo too  Oh she's terrific  That's exactly what I was thinking  Oh she's super  As soon as he said that  I'm like  He's talking about Janine Garofalo  She's super  With her stupid notebook  Megan Blake  She's just trying out material  Too full for the room  The movie  Roots is funnier than her  The movie  That was funny  You should never let the black girl  Turn around  When she gets your water for you  Yeah we're not big fans 
[02:10:00]  Of Janine Garofalo  On this show  Not at all  She did the first episode  Of Tough Crowd  It was eight test episodes  We got  And she hated my guts  Of course she did  I did a coyote age joke  And from there on  And it was just brutal  Yeah  You know I will say this  About her though  And that's why  You know  I never thought she was funny  But she gets her craft  Yep  I mean she's found her audience  That's what you gotta do  As comedians  Find your audience  And they go  And they go  By 1500 a night  2000 a night  And they laugh  And you don't know 
[02:10:30]  What the hell  They're laughing at  But they're laughing  They don't either  They're just like  Wow she's brilliant  It's just kind of  Being channeled through her  And they hand out  Free flannel after the show  Yeah  Exactly  Not one dick in that audience  And a free haircut  Tim in Wisconsin  Another trucker  What's up Tim?  Hey not bad  How's it going  Oh and hey  We're hanging with  Larry the cable guy  Larry  Yes sir  Hey  Get her done  Get her done  Hey what I want to know  Is was your wife 
[02:11:00]  From Birchwood  Or excellent  No it's not my wife  It's my girlfriend  And she was actually  From a little town  Called Spooner  Oh yeah  You know where that is  The Spooner Rails  Yeah Spooner  That's where she  Yeah the rails  I think your grandpa  Owns the whole town  Oh yeah  Yeah that was  It's like a foreign language  When these two  Are told  Well have you ever  Been to Spooner?  Hell no  Well you can't  Take enough film  For that trip  I tell you what though 
[02:11:30]  Wisconsin  Is one of the most  Beautiful states  In the country  If you ever get a chance  To go up there  I don't think I will  I don't think I'll ever  Get the chance  Oh it's nice  Colder than a witch's tit  Though this morning  Up here  Yeah  Nine degrees  We got right now  Hey Ben  Why don't you run over there  And open all the  Bathroom windows  There in Wisconsin  There you have it  Alright freak  And those witch's tits  They get real  Yeah  I was up  Just grab one  Yeah what does that mean?  Yeah  They've been saying that  For years  I know  What does it mean?  I've never even seen  A witch's tit  To tell 
[02:12:00]  I remember  We went up there  I got a rent-a-car  Up there  In Wisconsin  And by the way  If you ever get a rent-a-car  And you want to cheat  On the mileage  Don't use white-out  They figured that out  They get that shit  Figured that out  But I got one  Of those rent-a-cars  It had a voice  I don't know if you've  Seen this  Jim if you get rent-a-cars  But it had a voice  Activated radio  One of those new radios  Like if you want to hear  Country music  You just sit there  And you go  Country music  And it'll come on  And you go like  Rock and roll  And it'll come on  So I wanted to hear  Some country music 
[02:12:30]  And I was about  To say country  Some lady cut me off  Leaving the parking lot  And I yelled out  To Will  You stupid bitch  You know  Because I was pissed  And I said  Stupid bitch  And Dr. Laura  Come on the radio  I had to listen to  Dr. Laura  All the way down  To Spooner  Spooner  Unbelievable  Go and take on the day  She really should be  Killed in a boating accident  That sounds like this whore  We got lots of phone calls  Coming in  Ellis in Philly  What's up Ellis  Yo man  This is the best guest  You guys have had on ever 
[02:13:00]  It's great man  It's the only guest  We've had on lately  No offense to Larry  The cable guy  But let's be honest here  It's not like the guests  Are pounding down the door  To come on the new  Opie and Anthony show yet  They should be  Alright  Yeah they ought to be  They're good folks in here  You know I was up  And I used to work  I'm Phil  Did you ever used to work  A long time ago  At Funny Bone  Up on South Street  I think I did  An open mic  I started in 1990  So I think they were  Kind of winding down  By that time  Early 90s  Yeah  They were eating it then  Yeah  I remember I opened up  It was me and Paula Poundstone 
[02:13:30]  In 1987 I think  Oh  Yeah  That was when  Everyone  Everyone was a stand up comic  Everybody and their sisters  Was she touching kids  Back then  No  No  She diddled my butt  A little bit  She noodled me  She punched you in the face  She punched me  She punched me in the face  And stuck a finger  Which definition  Which definition  Of the noodling  Did you get from Paula Poundstone  Hopefully the punching  In the face  Well I've been hearing your name 
[02:14:00]  Like long before  The Blue Collar Tour  And that stuff  All the club  Larry the Cable Guy  And you were on the same circuit  I was on  But for years  You heard the name  And it was like  In the Midwest  And all these places  You were just getting huge  Yeah I just  I love Blue Collar TV  It's great  It took off  Like how long ago  Because it really just took off  Yeah well we did that movie  About three years ago  Two years ago  Two and a half years ago  But we had been touring with it  For three years  Okay  And you know  It's just  Arenas right 
[02:14:30]  Yeah we did arenas  And you know  It's a credit to the fans  Because the fans  Just want to come out  And laugh  And have a good time  And I think that's the thing  They could do with us  Because none of us cared  About the PC stuff  We wanted to do  What we thought was funny  Right  And we wanted to do stuff  That everyday people  Come across  And it was four different styles  You had Foxworthy  You had Engvall  You had Mean  You had Ron White  And all four of us  Are completely different  So you had something  For everybody  So it was real good  But the thing I liked  About it was  Of course all the 
[02:15:00]  New York and L.A. critics  You know  If you don't have  A gay character  You don't have this  Or you don't have that  You're not a good show  Of course Blue Collar TV  You know  We're just doing what we do  Of course they all trashed it  Then the ratings came back  Through the roof  Bravo  And so  Then you don't hear nothing  From the critics  Of course not  Of course not  A lot of calls from P.A. today  Rich what's up  What's up man  I just wanted to see  If Sensei  If he searched  The cable guy  Oh Master Poe  Did Master Poe search you

[02:18:00]  That's whatever  Right  They wear those  Stockings  Like burlap  Awful  I like it  Wing House  You can actually  Get a blowjob  And a macaroni salad  It's on the menu  That's great  I can say macaroni salad  On the radio  You never used to be able  To say macaroni salad  You figure out  This satellite radio  Hey this is Larry  The Cable Guy  And you're listening  To the worst  Of Opie and Anthony  The virus is now free  Yeah sure  I know the Opie and Anthony  Theme song

[02:20:00]  So  You're the sales guy  For Opie and Anthony  You need to sell  The rest of the XM nation  On the ONA virus  Everybody who's never heard of them  Or haven't heard them yet on XM  Go ahead  If you want  Unfiltered  Uncensored  Brilliant comedy  Brilliant commentary  Debauchery  You know  This is the show  And again  Unfiltered  And  To paraphrase  Another show  No spin  No nonsense  It's just  It's what it is 
[02:20:30]  And it's the truth  ONA is the truth  For everyone who has XM  And has not listened to  Opie and Anthony  This is a unique  And wonderful opportunity  To hear  A fabulous show  It's  It's different  It's edgy  It's informative  It's funny  It'll probably make you  Barf on one occasion  But  It's just something special  And XM listeners  Are going to be  In for something  That's truly amazing  Ah  We got it all on tape

[02:22:30]  And I think I missed  A couple good stories  Because I walk in  And it's going  Oh my god  Wow what  Larry's on the road  All the time  So he does a lot of radio  And kind of did radio  For years I guess  Yeah I started doing radio  In 1991  And you know Ron  From Ron and Ron  Oh yeah I started with  Ron and Ron  Yeah they're good folks  Yeah  Yeah they're good friends  Of ours  Ron and Fez now  The Ron and Fez version  Is really really funny  They're talking about  Some people that just  Don't get it  In radio  Yeah yeah 
[02:23:00]  How about just about everyone  I was telling them  I called this guy  The other day  Doing him  On some country station  I don't remember  Where it was at  Indiana or something  And I love doing  My call ins  But every now and then  You'll get one guy  That's king of the  Small town  But he came on  And he goes  99 Froggy  You know  And he had that  And he had that voice  You know  He's like  But everything was  A frog reference  I mean  For the Froggy  Yeah he was like 
[02:23:30]  It's one of those  In PA too man  But I called up  And he goes  Larry have you done  A Froggy's  Dish of this hour  And I said  Yeah I've done  Several Froggy's  Well my name is  Hoppy John  We're having a  Hoppy day here at  Froggy  We're at the  Swamp today  Tadpole's gonna  Call us later  And I'm like  Oh my god  Everything was about  The Frog  Oh dude  I'm laughing my ass  Off  You know  And he goes  Hey you're gonna  Be working where  Dolly Parton was  And I go  Yeah  I heard she  Change your name  To Emerson Beggins  Like Emerson Drive 
[02:24:00]  You know  And he goes  Okay let's stop this  Okay we can't  Say that on the radio  And I go  You can't say  Emerson Beggins  This is a very  Family oriented  Program  And then he came  And then he said  It like that  This is a very  Family oriented  Program  Hold on a second  Let's start again  Talk it out  This guy's insane  Oh you're  Okay you were  Taping for  Yeah  Oh man  You gotta be kidding  That's hilarious  Emerson Beggins  He got pissed  At that  Emerson Beggins  Come on 
[02:24:30]  I know  He was insane  Should've gone on  Right at the next one  After he did his  Big intro  And he goes  I guess  Cunt's out of the  Question  Well there goes  That bit  Yeah  That's crazy  Cunt's only bad  If you use it  As an adverb  Really  Yep  Way to stop the show  Larry's killing over here  And you ought to do that  Just figured I'd chime in  With a little  English language  A little English lesson  Thank you Jimmy  Just completely remind people  How bad it could be today  I saw that show  For the first time  I don't get a lot of time 
[02:25:00]  To watch TV  But I was home  For the holidays  And we was watching  The Apprentice  Yeah  I gotta tell you  I think that's  The dumbest show  I've seen my whole life  I blew it off  I can't be bothered  By that show  I mean here's a game show  And first prize is a job  Who the hell  Wants to win  A freaking job  On a game  Put a washer and dryer  On there for God  What second place  That's a great point  What second place  Homework  You know  It's ridiculous  I like that  But I did hear though  The last show 
[02:25:30]  The big finale  Donald Trump's  Gonna get his hair imploded  So we'll be looking  Forward to that  What show we like  We like the swan  Have you seen the swan  I've never seen the swan  Do cosmetic surgery  On these freaks in nature  They get these women  And they're all  They all have mental problems  They were abused  They all have some  And they have some  Horrendous problem  One woman last week  No teeth  She lost all her teeth  At 25 years old  So she's crying  And it's not due to  An accident  Or anything like that  She's a lazy brother 
[02:26:00]  Didn't want to brush her teeth  So she popped her teeth out  And they talk about  What they're gonna do to them  Through the whole show  And at the end  They parade them out  And they all make them  Just look like strippers  Like cheap  Bubble-headed  Blonde  Big-titted strippers  And it's great  To get these women  That have no  No self-confidence  Whatsoever  They've been abused  They're crying  Through half of the episode  And then ask them  What size tits they want  Because they just think  That the bigger the tits  The better they're gonna  Feel about themselves  The better guys  Are gonna treat them 
[02:26:30]  And they all wind up  Coming in for the big reveal  At the end  With just these  Gigantuan ribs  Yeah they make them  All look like strippers  Basically  Yeah  Big blonde head  With the collagen  In their lips  It's a great show  Face lifts  Brow lifts  Liposuction  It's unbelievable  What they do to these girls  And that is gonna make  Men treat them better  Though  That's actually  A very accurate  It absolutely does  Make men treat them better  Because they're just  Slobs when they start  You can just watch  The first five minutes  Watch their sob story  And then watch  The last five minutes  The rest of the show  Is all bullshit  And my sister-in-law 
[02:27:00]  Is cancer  And I lost my third child  I need some tits  It'll just make things  That's it  That's exactly it  That's exactly the show  I'm getting a divorce  My brother lost seven pounds  In seven minutes  Seven pounds in seven minutes  That's right  He flossed his teeth  That's what's getting me  On the big shows 
[02:27:30]  Norton  Cunt is an adverb  Back after this folks  Yeah you gotta be  A little smarter  With your comedy  Like Larry the cable guy  Yeah right  That's real heady  Right there  And what's the  What's the cable guy story  When I first started  Doing call ins  I was doing  A cable installer  On stage  And my buddy Ron  Said man that's funny  You gotta call  The morning show 
[02:28:00]  And you gotta do that  I mean that's funny  We need some characters  On there  And I said  Alright I'll give you a holler  But I can't just  I can't  What am I just gonna call up  And start bitching  About politics  I gotta have a reason  To call up  And well I guess  They were waiting  On the cable guy  To call for a couple days  And he never did  So since I was  Doing a cable installer  I just called up  As a cable guy  And the name  People were just like  Man that was funny  Of course they called me  They said who's this  And I said it's Larry  And they said  Larry 
[02:28:30]  Yeah the cable guy  Oh we've been waiting  On you  And so then we  Riffed into some bits  And people went  Man that's funny  That Larry the cable guy  Was that a real guy  Or is that  Of course we told everybody  It was a real guy  That called  And it just kind of stuck  And I just started  Being known as  Larry the cable guy  And then I started  Getting on more stations  And so I just toured  As Larry the cable guy  Then you can't change it  After so long  Right well people  Kind of know you by it  Yeah people know me  Well that's my problem  Opie I hate the name  He's gotta go around  Stuck with me now forever  I got it when I was 12 
[02:29:00]  If it worked  It worked for a couple years  I don't know  Opie's a great nickname  For a kid  Right it's not a radio name  It's not a radio name  It was a stupid name  I got when I was 12  I'm stuck with it  And I truly want  To change my name  For the radio  But now we've been  Doing this for 10 years  I can't  Well yeah  Well you're both  Millionaires  So your nicknames  Are working out  Very nice  They could call me  Jim the Tommy Morrison's  Blood sample  Hey I'm a little more clever  See I didn't go to the  People would recognize you 
[02:29:30]  Let's go see the blood sample  He's down here  You call like hundreds of stations  I was up to 27  I think there was a time  We were trying to get you  When we were up in Boston  But it just didn't work out  Because you were calling  It was ridiculous  Yeah I was up to 27  Every morning you just wake up  And just one after another  Right  Yes sir  6 to 11 every morning  But it was fun  I enjoyed it  It was a good time  Met a lot of nice people  Yeah  But you'd set these up  Like a week in advance  Right now you had  Boom  You know  I knew who I was going to call 
[02:30:00]  What times I was going to call  But you know  All the stations I called  The majority of them  Just great guys  I mean we all got along  And so it was fun  It was more fun  And it was never really  A station you'd call  And go man I hate calling  These freaking morons  You know  So it was all  It was all real good  There was plenty of them  Yeah  Oof  What about you doing  The Foxworthy roast  Yeah we're doing the roast  That ought to be pretty fun  You know  Because I'm kind of like  What are you going to bash them  About anything  Yeah give us a  Give us a little preview  No  Give us one  Two  I think I say one thing 
[02:30:30]  In there where I go  Jeff Foxworthy's show  Oh he was once called  The worst actor ever  In a sitcom  And that was at the same time  That the retard Corky  From Life Goes On  Was that  And I go  You're really bad  If you're not even better  Than crippled actors  Yeah that's good  That's funny  Christopher Reeve  Was watching this show  And I actually got up 
[02:31:00]  And turned the camera  I'll probably get shit on that  But it's funny  Screw it  Go with it  Are you kidding  There's a good line up  Tonight too  It's you  It's all the guys  In the blue collar tour  Yeah it's me  Bill  Ron  It's going to be  Nick DiPaolo  Who's one of my favorite  Comedian of all time  Angry Nick  Nick's great  And then  You know  DeCastroix  Collin I think  Collin's in there  And Dennis Leary  Okay  So there's a few of them 
[02:31:30]  In there  Hell yeah  We got some ringers  We're supposed to go to that  Well we can't go out anymore  But we can't go out  It's goddamn morning radio  We have to get up at 4  Yeah you gotta go to bed 7  By 6.30 at night  I try to stretch it to 8  But you're kind of looking like  Oh boy  Yeah it's just about bedtime  Are the tickets available  For that tonight  Or is it sold out  I think it's sold out tonight  I'm not sure  But I'm pretty sure it is  Yeah they got  Looked like all them tables  Had name places on them  So I think they pretty much  Sold out  Alright  Larry in Texas  What's up Larry 
[02:32:00]  Not too much man  Good morning  How are you  How are you  Hi Mr  I just got a quick question  Or actually two of them  One real quick  What is a roast  I'm not too familiar  With the comedian language  It's where you stick your tongue  Up somebody's ass  And then you put your fist  In the catfish  Oh shit  Alright  Second question  Larry  No a roast  Is where you just  Whoever the celebrity  Is getting roasted  You just kill them 
[02:32:30]  You just go up  And you just  Tell jokes about them  That's basically it  It's like the old  Do you ever see  The old Dean Martin roast  The old Milton Berle roast  Oh yeah  Yeah it's just like that  And they're pretty vicious  To a lot of them  Yeah they get vicious  Cause it's all comedians  Shitting on each other  And comedians are vicious  To each other  So they're really  Roasts are very funny  You'll probably hear  The word talk somewhere  Yeah  Okay  Second question  Larry the Campbell guy  And for Jimmy Norton  Are y'all going to be  Doing any shows  Down in the Houston area  In the near future 
[02:33:00]  Oh my god  Well I'm at the Houston Improv  I mean I'm a truck driver  I'm a truck driver  And the only time  I can really get to  Places to see you guys  Is when I'm at home  I'm at the Houston Improv  In January  And I think Larry  Will be doing the Astrodome  Sometime right after that  That's gonna be kind of hard  Actually  No but actually  I'm taping my new  Live album  January 14th  And 15th  At the Verizon Wireless Theater

[02:37:00]  On a piece of bread  By God  So fresh  The bull goes  Ow  And you bite that on  And the penis fingers  Are good  If you've ever had  The penis fingers  There's just so much  That is edible  On a steer  That by the time  You get to the nuts  I think I'm full  You know  I'll take  I'll take the worst  Cut of steak  There is  You know  Eat the grizzle  Yeah  I'll eat the grizzle  I don't care  Like you're foraging  Off a squirrel  For something  There's plenty of meat

[02:38:00]  The I ain't got nothing else  To do on a Friday  Either  He ain't a good bowler  I went to watching  Bowl last Wednesday  And I caught a ball  Our own Steve did that  Steve threw one  Off the wall  Last time we played  Yeah  But he likes to drink  A little bit  He likes his martinis  That's why we call  Martini Steve  Yeah  I don't drink anymore  I used to drink  But the neighbors  Got up a petition 
[02:38:30]  And I don't care  What they say  I still say  Them puppies  Don't look nothing  Like me  That was a rough night  That night  Jimmy  You know what I'm talking  Oh yeah  Alright  A couple more calls  And we'll get you  Out of here  Dwayne from Nebraska  What's up  Huskers  Not much  What's going on guys  Go Huskers  You bet  That's what I was going  To call you  About what you think  Of those guys  This year  First losing season  Since 1961  I'm a big Nebraska  Cornhusker fan  And I've never been alive 
[02:39:00]  When they've had a losing team  In five and six years  I've always been  Always been going to a ball game  Or something like that  Yeah that streak  The national streak  And that Nebraska  Is the only team  They had the streak  38 straight years  Going to ball games  And they're not going  This year for the first time  Didn't they one year  I'm not a college football fan  But didn't they one year  Have a big record  And they were going for the win  Instead of just taking the tie  And the guy dropped  The two point conversion  In the end zone  I think that's my only  College football memory  Watching Nebraska  Look at you  Yeah a few years ago  You know what 
[02:39:30]  And Tom Osborne did that  And I always give  We in Nebraska  Always give him credit for that  Because a lot of those teams  Back when they were doing that  They would kick the extra point  Because if you're the number one  Team in the country  You're not beat  You're the only undefeated team  You're going to win  The national championship  We were playing Miami  And we're the only undefeated  Team in the country  And we tied it up  And with just a few seconds  To go in the game  And instead of kicking  That extra point  To win the title  We went for two  We said we're going to win it  We're going to win it outright  And of course we didn't get it  But Osborne had some nuts 
[02:40:00]  And then I ate them on a sandwich  On a wonder bread  Yeah but no  Hey they'll get better  Keep the faith  Alright Dave and me  Wait one more question  Go go go  Would that have tied it  Or would that have won the game  That would have won the game  The extra point would have tied it  The extra point would have tied it  And they'd have won the national title  Oh the extra point would have tied it  But they went for two  Yeah  Wow  But I used to  I never played football  When I was in high school  I was a big dude  And I was in the band  And everybody called me  A sissy little fag  You know  But I love the baton 
[02:40:30]  I've got to tell you  I've always been a fan  Of the little tights  And the camel toes  Loved it  Dave in Maine  Hey Dave  Hey how you doing  We're in Maine  With Larry the Cable Guy  Hey you guys rock  Hey but I know  You're having trouble  Say a lot Lizard  You got so 80s  You got to be politically correct  Now they are sleeper creepers  Sleeper creepers  Okay  That's right  We're still learning  We're learning every day  About you guys  Alright well you guys rock  Alright thank you

[02:46:00]  They got a bone  In their penis  They do  Jeepers  That's a nice story  He's talking about  The raccoons  That's a wonderful story  Fantastic  How about that  I was down in Texas  Not long ago  And they  They're having  They can call up  If I'm wrong  But they were trying  To get rid of the phrase  Remember the Alamo  Really  Out of the Texas school  Isn't this ridiculous  Out of the Texas school system  Now why  What was their reason 
[02:46:30]  They said it's offensive  To Mexicans  Remember the Alamo  And I'm thinking to myself  Didn't they win that war  I think they kicked  Some ass there  Yeah  You would think  The offensive phrase  Would be  Remember the  Ass kicking  The Mexicans  Got after the Alamo  Would be the offensive  Right  You'd think  They'd run around  Saying remember  The Alamo  All the time  They kicked ass  That was the win  That's the first thing  They won since  They knocked  Puerto Rico  Out of the Olympics  In soccer  Three years ago  I mean  Good God  They want to keep  That phrase 
[02:47:00]  What else  What else can't you do  Now in school  You can't say God  In anything  I'm not a religious guy  But it's like  They want to remove God  From any of the  Like you could talk  About certain things  In class  But you can't talk  About certain parts  Of the Constitution  Or the Bill of Rights  That have God in it  That have God in it  Yeah I heard that  The other day  God the left  Is so irritating  They really are irritating  It's like Meathead  From all in the fame  That's who's running  You know the country  Meathead  Yeah yeah yeah  Absolutely  And he's like that  In real life too  He's the one that  Started the whole  Non-smoking thing  In LA  He loves being called  Meathead too  Yeah I'm sure  All the work  He's done afterwards 
[02:47:30]  Hey Meathead  Yeah  We got to play that  How hard you work  You're still just  A Polack sidekick  To us stupid  We got to get the retard  Of making Meathead  Sing the song  All uncomfortable  If I always say  If more people  Stood up  And said enough  Is enough  That shit  Would stop happening  But everybody's  Scared to say anything  I mean  People are scared  To say stuff  Or they just  Live their lives  People have lives  To lead  They have jobs  To go to  Exactly  They're not like  The Hollywood elite 
[02:48:00]  That has plenty  Of time to do  All this stuff  That they find  Time to do  Bitching about everything  And deciding  How we should  All lead our lives  Yeah but the people  Going to work  Nine to five  With three or four kids  You know  They don't have  Say  Yeah they don't  Have the time  To sit there  And write the letters  And they don't  Have a TV show  To go on  And spout the crap  That you hear  Coming out of these people  I think it's ridiculous  Pat Sajak  Actually wrote an article  Oh I read that one  It's about Hollywood  And how disgustingly 
[02:48:30]  Agenda obsessed they are  And it's about  The Dutch filmmaker  Who was killed  For offending Muslims  Can you imagine  In this country  If a filmmaker  Was killed  Over something  He did on abortion  If an abortion  Anti-abortion activist  Shot him  And killed him  The outrage  From Hollywood  But because it  Involves Islam  They don't say anything  And this is one  Of their own  Who was killed  And Pat Sajak  I can't believe  I'm saying  And Pat Sajak  Was saying  Yeah whenever you  Point him out  As a poignant source  I know  I was disgusted  I had to keep  Going to the top  Of the article  Knowing Pat Sajak 
[02:49:00]  The Wheel of Fortune guy  Because he was  Making complete sense  Right  And he was talking  About that  And how this guy  This filmmaker  Was killed  Because he  Did a film  About Muslims  And how they  Treat their women  And some guy  You know  Killed him  And left a note  Stabbed into his chest  Slit the guy's throat  I mean really  Worked him over  That guy was trying  To send a message  You think so  Yeah yeah yeah  I don't want to  Read as much into it  What are you  A psychiatrist  Over there  You can't figure  These people out  Can't you  But if it happened  Over abortion 
[02:49:30]  You can bet  Every fucking  Liberal  Hollywood filmmaker  Would be screaming  About it in the press  But because it's Islam  And they don't want  To be seen like  They're agreeing  With George Bush  On anything  That was the point  He brought up  He goes  Who wouldn't be  Outraged at this  They don't want  To say anything  Not because  They're not outraged  By it  But because  They don't want  To align themselves  With the president  Or his policy  On Iraq  Or anything  And it wouldn't be  Of course not  It's just  A filmmaker was killed  Because of a film he made 
[02:50:00]  Let that outrage you  Don't be so scared  That people are going to go  Oh you're knocking Islam  And Muslims  You must be aligned  With President Bush  No  But they are  Such pussies  Over there  Yeah they totally are  And that's the thing  I mean it's unbelievable  You can make  That's the point  I always make  You can make fun  Of born again Christians  In Hollywood  As much as you want  But it wasn't  Baptist preachers  Flying planes  In the buildings  Right  You make fun  Of a Muslim  Oh you're an asshole 
[02:50:30]  You're a bigot  But oh go ahead  And make fun  Of anybody else  But don't make fun  Of the Muslims  They're the ones  Flying the damn plane  Oh but it's not  Yeah or it's not  It's all of them  I've seen  Yeah exactly  Calling out a great line  Of tough crowd  They're talking about Islam  He goes look  You can't let a few million  Bad apples spoil the bunch  That's a good one  All right maybe later  Yeah it's totally insane  I mean  And that's why I like 
[02:51:00]  Getting on stage  And trying to encourage  Just regular folks  Hey if people started  Speaking up  And say  Hey enough of this  Bullshit  It'd stop  You know  Especially in that  Schools taking God  People wouldn't want  That to happen  But they don't say nothing  And you're exactly right  Because they ain't got  Time to say something  They don't have time  People are busy  They're trying to live  Their lives  They're not writing  Things and protesting  And getting out  It's the people  That have no life  Or this elite Hollywood  That from their  Gated houses 
[02:51:30]  Think they know  Exactly what the  Common man is thinking  And what they should  Be doing  And how they should  Treat other people  And they know nothing  You ever go on to  Barbara Streisand's  Web page  And read her words  Of wisdom  She writes every week  Or every month or so  I read this  And I swear to God  It's like watching  Mars attacks  Those  Act act act  They made more sense  We should get that  And read it on the air  Oh we should  Absolutely  She's an irrelevant  Elitist bag of meat  She's done nothing good 
[02:52:00]  Since nuts  That's the last good project  She was involved with  When she played a hooker  Which is exactly  What she should be doing  Jabbing that fucking awful  Flintstones record player  Nose into your stomach  While she's sucking the cock  On the ballpark  God she makes me nauseous  My eyes have seen the glory  Of the coming of the Lord  I agree with Jamie Norton on that  Well they caught her out there  They caught her out there  Talking about  She was talking about  How saving energy or something  In her apartment  Even when she's out of the country 
[02:52:30]  Have to be air conditioned  To like 60 degrees  Sure  And her spokesman actually said  Well Barbara  That applies to other people  But not her  They actually came out  And said that  Because the inconsistency  Had been caught  And the ones that hop on the bandwagon  For PETA  That terrorist organization  That tries to save animals  They're awful  They hop on the bandwagon  About how bad it is  And you won't catch them  Without their leather boots on  Right  And why is leather okay then?  How about if you're going to  Tell people they can't eat meat  And throw paint on fur coats 
[02:53:00]  How about you don't wear anything  That has anything to do with an animal?  You look like shit every day  Your makeup, everything  I agree  And I'll tell you something else  That's why  They take a tour bus everywhere  Because I'm not putting up  With that crap at the airport anymore  I mean until they start  Until they start  What you call it?  Oh yeah yeah  Profiling  Profiling  Absolutely  And that's it  Because that's what they do in Israel  They profile  Oh yeah  But we can't do it here  Because we're going to hurt  Somebody's feelings  I'm sick and tired 
[02:53:30]  Now you've got to take your jacket off  You've got to take this off  I went through the other day  To save time  I went through  And nothing but a pair of speedos  And they still  Pulled me out of the line  And accused me of smuggling  In a pocket knife  Do you believe that?  No we're giving it to Paul  But they will let  They will let  They will only have  A certain amount of guys  If they see 10 Arabic guys  Going through  And obviously not all Arabic guys  Are terrorists  But if you were to look at  An 80 year old lady  Why?  You're wasting time and resources 
[02:54:00]  Checking over old women  From the south  You know  Kids  Things like that  And then yeah  If you see some Arab gentlemen  Some Middle Eastern gentlemen  Come by  Check them  Why?  Look at the past record  You could pretty much tell  Who the guys are  That might be pulling  Some shenanigans on air  I remember  I was flying  Like the day you could fly  After 9-11  And I'm going to  Houston, Texas  Alright I got my buckle on  I'm going down there  At the rodeo down there

[02:55:00]  Problem here  And I said  You just let 4 Middle Eastern  Dudes on the plane  With carry-ons  And you're going to  Pull us out of the line  Dressed like Butch Cassidy  And a Sundance kid  And you're going to  Let them  I go  This is ridiculous  Well it's just random  Bullshit  Random  Well don't make it random  But people are so afraid  Of offending  Like you said  Don't offend  How about we start  Offending a little bit  When you're looking  For mobsters  Do you talk to Jews  Or blacks  No you look for Italians  When you want the Westies  You look for Irish  In Hell's Kitchen  It's like that's  What you're looking for  Right now  Sorry

[02:57:30]  With another  Opie and Anthony  Interlocular  The worst of O and A  Jim you've been on the  On the show for the whole ride  Up  Down  All around  Well since the NAW  Not the entire time  But yeah  Since here yeah  What's the difference in  Coming from a stage  And having to adjust  To FM  And then coming back  With total freedom of XM  Uh  The language freedom  Is great  Um  You know  And there's less time to eat  That wraps it up  What's the difference in  O and A 2000 
[02:58:00]  O and A 2005  Wow  What's the difference  That's easier to do the show  I know what the problem  It's just  It's a little easier  To touch on certain  Subject matter  You know  We still do  A lot of the same  You know  We have a lot of the same  Conversations  Stuff that guys like to talk about  But it's easier  You know  You don't have to sit there  Beating around the bush  For 20 minutes  Hoping some morons  Understand what you're talking about  Because you've got to talk in code  20 times removed  From what you're actually talking about  So you don't get in trouble  Now we can just get on  And blah blah blah 
[02:58:30]  Now  Back to the worst of  Opie and Anthony  On XM 202  High Voltage  And I know we're not going to talk about this today  But can I just say  Oh I forgot about that  No we don't have to talk about it  I just want to say the guy who's  Because I showed Ant the book  And he threw it on the floor  Yeah that's why we were laughing earlier  I forgot about that  I take it that's an ixnay  I'm a discussion A  But um  The guy who sent in the uh  The big book of boy stuff  Bart King  Yeah  Um 
[02:59:00]  Says FBI approved in the front  Federal burping institute  That's funny  Oh  I missed that  Yeah  I threw the book  And I missed that line  Let me see that  That is something  Federal burping institute  It's the big  Book  Of boy stuff  And I guess it's supposed to be  A whole book  Of things that interest  Guys  Yeah 
[02:59:30]  Looks like a textbook  Textbooks are a little more  The back one's got a funny line on the  Oh what does it say  It says  A CIA manual  But then it says  CIA is craniums in adversity  I'm trying to  I don't get it  I don't really get it either  I'm like  Smells good in the book right  Smells like the first day of school  I'm going through the book  And I don't really 
[03:00:00]  See anything I  Wouldn't want to read  To anybody  I'd rather read  More Cindy Adams stuff  I think  I'll just smell the book  Yep  The writing stinks  But the book smells good  Duda  Duda  Indoor games  What is it about  A pocket knife  That we like  They have sharp blades  And they fold up  And fit in our pocket  They're fun to hold  And to goof around with  And of course  The pocket tools  Like the Leatherman 
[03:00:30]  Pocket survival tool  Are also cool  Folding pocket knives  Were made 2,000 years ago  For Roman soldiers  These old knives  Had folding blades  And many attachments  Include  What?  Pooping and peeing  Anthony  Some people think  That you should not  Poop in the woods  Because there are  Plenty of logs there already  Hello?  Hello?  Nevertheless  When you have to go  You have to go  And nature calls 
[03:01:00]  A lot louder  When you're out in it  A good rule of thumb  For pooping and peeing  Is to take care  Of your business  At least 100 feet  From camp  Peeing  Here are the most important  Words you will ever read  Don't pee into the campfire  The smell will be awful  And everyone will hate you  Pee where nobody  Will be disturbed by you  But don't get lost  Think of how embarrassing  That would be  If you got lost  While going for a pee  It's as embarrassing  As having your name  As author of that book  And then it's  Then he has a scenario  Father says 
[03:01:30]  How did you get lost  Timmy?  Timmy says  I was going to take a pee  And the next thing I knew  I was lost  Father says  Why didn't you let me go  With you?  Timmy says  Because the last time  We did that  You raped me by a tree  Yeah  Some male campers  Just keep a wide mouth jug  Near their sleeping bag  In case they have to go  During the night  Wide mouth jug  Thank goodness  You were born a boy  Just make sure  That nobody wants  Any lemonade in the morning  I misread it  Wide mouth jig  Jesus 
[03:02:00]  There's a good line here  By the way  About bullies  Yeah  It says  When I was a kid  Everyone was always  Trying to convince me  That bullies  Were actually cowards  If you just stood up  To the bullies  They would chicken out  And leave you alone  And then he says  What a bunch of baloney  Baloney  Pooping  There we are  Pooping  Taking a good dump  In the wilderness  Requires you to  Hunker down  This means that 
[03:02:30]  Since you don't have  A toilet to sit on  You're just  Going to have to pretend  Now you're hunkering  After you're done  Most good campers  Do a thing called  Cat sanitation  That means they  Bury their poop  Like a cat does  Ah  Uh oh  And to do this Anthony  You need a small shovel  Dig a hole  At least six to eight inches deep  Hunker down  And poop into it  Toilet paper  Hunker down  If you have ever had to  Wipe using bark or leaves  You'll know  It is not very pleasant  It's even worse  If you accidentally  Grab some poison oak 
[03:03:00]  Be sure to clean up well  You don't want to leave  Any dew on the lily  If you know what I mean  This could lead to  Bacon strips in your underwear  Instead of in the frying pan  Where they belong  As for the toilet paper  Be friendly to the environment  Either burn it  Or bring a zipper lock baggie  And pack it out with you  If you will be camping  In the same spot for a while  Just sprinkle some dirt  Over your poop  So that others  Can use the spot  When you are done  With your poop hole  Cover it up completely  And run away  Wait Opie  There's a section in here  Oh my god  He's gonna 
[03:03:30]  What's the window  Now Opie  You may have thrown that too soon  You missed the section marked  Jokes  Exclamation point  Under the caption  School and studies  Father  From this report card son  It looks like you studied  Underwater  Timmy  What do you mean dad  Father  Well all of your grades  Are below C level  And then Timmy says  Good one dad  Hello  Hello

[03:10:00]  As I think about it  That's the beginner insult  Your book stinks  The intermediate insult is  Hey Steve  If you ever bring this horse shit  To the show again  I'll rip your cock off  And stick it in your ear  Alright did we get rid of all those  All the copies  What?  The author's on 10  Oh  Hello Bart  Hey guys  Have you been listening to the show today?  I unfortunately have not  I didn't know it was coming on  Until a split second ago

[03:11:00]  Yeah  If you look at the dust jacket  And flip it  It has like an old style composition  Bart I gotta tell you  I really think that you came up with a winner here  Ah you guys are too kind  Thank you  He can't  I appreciate that  He can't hear the show  No he can't hear it  He's still there  He didn't hear the show  Uh no  He has no idea  Uh no Bart we're here  Okay sorry  It's like a guy's how to book pretty much  Yeah kind of uh  Passing on the keys of boyhood  To the next generation  Yeah Bart I gotta tell you  I think um  You got some comedic licks to you  Yeah where'd you get some of the uh 
[03:11:30]  Jokes and stuff  Uh you know  The uh for the jokes  I really ransacked my uh childhood memory  And I was looking for uh  Stuff that my dad had told me  When I was a kid  That I thought was funny  Wow  Yeah the uh  A lot of my dad kind of went through it  And he said  You basically plundered all my material  Did your dad have brain cancer?  Sorry I'm picking up a weird reverb there  I hope this works out for you  What's it  No it's working  Is that your phone?  I guess  It's uh cordless  Oh yeah  There's some kind of um  Static  Yeah sorry about that 
[03:12:00]  That's okay  That's okay  We can uh  We can still talk here  So what  It's a book  Uh how would you best describe the uh  The book?  I guess I would call it  A combination of  Mad Magazine  And Boy Scout Manual  That's what  I was looking for with it anyway  That hits it right on the head  I think  If you want acid  So uh  Kind of have  Have a humorous feature chapter  And maybe a uh  Chapter on um  Yeah explain the book a little better  Because uh  We just got it  And uh  We went through a little bit of it  But um  We haven't really got the gist 
[03:12:30]  Uh for our listeners  You know  Yeah I don't know  We talked about the insults  And we thought the insults  Uh  Chapter was absolutely  Um  Yeah that was pretty good  Absolutely brilliant  Well I guess uh  If I had uh  One role model  That I was looking towards  When I read it  It was uh  Joseph Pujol  And if you look on page 130  You'll uh  See his mini biography  130  Wait wait 128  Hopefully this book still has 139  Uh  He was uh  His nickname was  The Fartomaniac  Oh yeah yeah  Oh yeah  Okay 
[03:13:00]  The what  The what  The what  The Fartomaniac  Yeah  Joseph uh  Pujol  Yeah there you go  He was kind of a  Moulin Rouge  Performer in Paris  And uh  Apparently he was like  The highest stage  Wait hold on hold on  I don't know if I  Wait what page is this  130  And what's uh  What was  What was he about again  Well apparently  When he was a kid  He went swimming  And uh  He sank  The reason why  Was because water  Was going into his  Signed in  Oh jeez  He found he had  The rare ability  To bring air  Into his rear end  And once he wanted 
[03:13:30]  To control those muscles  He found that he  Could see much fart at will  He could make butt bongos  Anytime he wanted to  Who is this  Robert Reed  Jimmy you're not as funny  He had a stage act  Where he would  Make different sounds  Uh  With his  Pine quarters  Uh  Which included  Cannons  Thunder  All types of dogs  Uh  Ducks  Owls  Are you  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  Are you close to the  Base unit of the phone  Because I'm hearing  A lot of static now  I'm sorry  Uh  Actually  I can back off 
[03:14:00]  From it a little bit  Yeah back off  Let's try that  Yeah  I would have got on  The hard line here  Yeah  How's that  That sounds a lot better  A little bit  But what's your favorite  Section in the book  Uh  It's actually really good  You know  I don't know what people  Are thinking  But uh  It's doing pretty well  Sales wise  Yeah it's got to be  Selling like crazy man  Yeah  Like hotcakes  Yeah  Or  Butt bongo cakes  Yeah so uh 
[03:14:30]  I think that's a  Serian indictment of  The good case  But I'll take it  What's that?  I'll take it  If people are interested  I think that's fantastic  Yeah I think uh  It's obvious  You put a  A lot of work  Into this thing  There's a lot of pages  I liked your  I liked your section  On pooping and peeing  In the outdoors  Yeah I have a sister  Who's a ranger  At a federal park  And she  She helped me  With some valuable  Outdoor  Number one  And number two tips  Yeah

[03:27:00]  hey is that a super bowl ring  no that's hall of fame ring  let me come on that's even better  thank you this is number 113  look at the size of that  obi  you know get back here  where are you going  he's running off with his ring  there you go  you're gonna need a better head start than that  i try to take off with deacon jones's hall of fame ring  look at the size of that thing  put it on  i could put this around my penis i think  jesus  if you were that lucky  and i'm not that small  but this will put it around my damn dick  i lost weight 
[03:27:30]  i had to put a filter in it  you know  to compensate  how much weight did you lose deacon  105 pounds  105  wow  i had to  i did it over a five year period  yeah  i had to  i i was having some problems physically and  uh...  uh...  oh there you go  here's your beer  from the lower back  the lower back  nice  what do you think of that deacon  thank you jesus  wow  thank you jesus  look at the girl that just  all i can do now is look  you know 
[03:28:00]  i can't do nothing by my eyes  i can always look  you can always look  that's right  absolutely  yeah but you know back to the weight thing  um  you know  who was asking about your weight  i'm 66 years old  and um  you know when you're 66  and you survive 14 years  of the nfl  yeah  you know although i didn't get no operations anything you know you still  you know i was zoomed up to about three hundred twenty pounds when i left the game  wow  i didn't do anything  and then you know no blood pressure ran up and then you know the old physical problems  started to come in  now i was very lucky i didn't have no injury so i didn't have no problem there but the lower 
[03:28:30]  back  is a standard injury for linemen  and boy  i had a fifty four inch waistline and i just could not even walk up a flight of stairs  so i had to do something about it  now i got a thirty five inch waistline and my phone keeps ringing  it keeps on  one more now  well how tall are you  six five  six five how much you weigh  i weigh about  two twenty five  two twenty  but you used to weigh like three fifty  well no no no no no  i said when i retired from the game i played at two seventy five  oh okay okay  when i retired  oh and then you don't want to blow them into that right right right because i quit 
[03:29:00]  exercise  uh-huh  i checked stopped i stopped all football activity  well they got one of the guys doing the steroids back in your day  what is the steroid i still can't identify  he doesn't know what i don't know what garbage man i mean you know you know what  i'd give you all the steroids you want you give me my nineteen sixty seven legs back and i'll give you a bottle of that stuff  let's see if it works  you know because there ain't nothing work i've ever seen but hard work and dedication  yeah yeah you understand all the steroid users probably ended up working harder 
[03:29:30]  maybe that's it  maybe that's it  but i mean if they can make men and make bad averages like they say they can  then there'll be a hell of a lot more guys outside the bar playing  instead of sitting in the bar  bullshitting  so you don't believe in that steroid thing at all  i don't believe in none of that garbage i think a man has to be a man  all right  i mean you know the press has built up a lot of things about that  well you gotta  but i mean the baseball players they've been they've been doing the steroids  they might make your body looks a different way  right  but if you ain't got eye hand coordination you ain't gonna hit that  that curveball 
[03:30:00]  you ain't gonna hit that fastball  that's what barry bonds was saying last night  it is a fact and he was saying on one of these shows last night  but the fact is yeah you need the eye hand coordination to hit the baseball  but because of the steroids you're hitting it another you know twenty thirty feet probably right  well i mean you know you know that's just like saying if you gave you gave a football player  steroids  you know and and you know i'm sure that  some of those guys have been taking them too i mean i don't know and don't quote me on that  no i don't know but i would i'd be sure in all sports there's some problem with some kind of a drug 
[03:30:30]  okay and they're they call them enhance enhancement what is human growth hormones hard stuff that garbage  you know  it might make your body develop or over develop  but what does it do for your football game or your baseball game that's what that's what the question is  you still need the talent you still need the talent and you still need our hand coordination  and it's like if you got a lineman you can give him all the steroids you want if he got slow feet he ain't gonna be no lineman  right sure okay as simple as that and i want to know where the cutoff is  i want to know where it makes you 
[03:31:00]  makes you hit  75 home runs at  and where it doesn't  why can't you pick up the bat then  and take steroids and hit 77 home runs  yeah right  i don't understand that  that's what i always try to tell him and he's always saying that the steroids make them better players  and i'm like no because it doesn't help with your actual skill  no it doesn't it doesn't do anything for your actual skill  Deacon I told you that  I got it look at my muscles i'm on the steroids  put your arm down man  put your arm down  somebody see you  somebody see you  you got his arms up  my breakfast is bigger than that this morning 
[03:31:30]  and i'm on a diet  god damn  i just gotta sit here and take it cause he's a monster  he's nailing you  he's nailing you  he's nailing you  so are you uh you playing today  am i playing today  i don't know  i'm gonna win today  you're gonna win  i didn't come here to play  he came here last night and played  you play a lot of poker  all my life  i played some form of poker  you play hold of malatha  i made a  i made a living on certain guys  really  i didn't get the big money but i got it from certain quarterbacks playing 
[03:32:00]  see this is  he's one of the dangerous guys out there  he's gonna he's gonna be dangerous out there  i hope they don't let me deal  no  if i deal i will never lose  oh bottom of the deck stuff like that  no i didn't say that  of course he didn't say that  anthony said it  he said it  he said it  you know the hair slap might be illegal in pro football  but it ain't illegal in this casino  have you been in any tournaments before?  any poker tournaments?  no this is my first time  i uh...  you know i'm kinda retired  i don't uh... 
[03:32:30]  i don't make too many appearances  uh...  i like poker because uh...  you know  i got some friends of mine who  couple years ago we started playing  texas holo  it's a fun game  and i played a couple golf to them  and marcus allen has a game  you know at his tournament  are you a golfer?  oh yeah  i'm an athlete  oh  um...  that might be a little bit strange to you  okay but i'm an athlete  i'm actually very athletic myself  i drink  i smoke and i go out with girls 
[03:33:00]  is this guy on the show?  yeah unfortunately not  why y'all got him standing all the way over there from you?  has he got some kind of disease?  no you do know him  well look at him  can you figure it out?  he say i stink  he didn't want to put that on his shirt  i kinda question that  the guy say i stink  no wonder y'all got him over there  i was actually standing there but you moved me over  and i was gonna move  but look at what they got you here  they got you away from the crew  well you know i was standing right there and you just stepped in and i moved 
[03:33:30]  i pulled you over here  you kinda threatened me just by looking at me and i left  i threatened everybody  what was i gonna do?  that's my job  you're a big man  i know it  it ain't the size of the sea that make the ship sink  it's the rock and motion of the ocean  that means you have a small penis  no  what the hell how did you get that out of that opie?  how did you get that out of that?  evidently you ain't heard about the myth  wait what happened?  no i've heard about the myth  well trust me i started it  wait what did he say then?  i thought he was saying that that's the  no man  how you  do you 
[03:34:00]  what?  can you say that again so i can try to figure out what he was saying?  is this show  is this show authorized?  is it actually on the air?  are we actually on the air?  are we just talking?  are we talking locally here?  this is actually being fed into a tape recorder  we're just gonna play for our friends later  yeah  you cut him out  then we cut him out  yeah you got tricked man  this isn't being broadcast anywhere  and watch it you see now how good i am  watch your ratings change anyway  Deacon's alright bro  he's alright  i like Deacon 
[03:34:30]  one of my favorite odd couple episodes with Deacon Jones in it  oh thank you  remember that one?  he was doing a film in the commercial  right?  we did that in 1969  69  69 and they still play it  yeah  that residuals is that residuals  you get a check from that?  to this day  isn't that something  for 10 cents?  no  the residuals weren't that great back then  I started not much higher than that  what was the shaving cream?  what was it?  back then  back then in 1969  where were you born?  i was born in the 60's  what year in the 60's?  right around there  if you ever take a couple years  no no 
[03:35:00]  give me your actual date  give Mr. Jones your age  uh...  how old do you think i am?  don't ask me that question  i mean we on the air  can't you give it up?  or are you embarrassed about it?  nah i was born in 65  oh  i got jockstraps older than you  i still got jockstraps  it's unwashed man  you know  right off the field  all i'm trying to say  is when you were in a sitcom  but you've been on the 65  you can't say nothing to my president  no  you're supposed to raise your hand  and ask permission  we have studied tv shows 
[03:35:30]  no you haven't  and we have friends that were on old sitcoms  and this is the only point i'm trying to make  like they didn't have the residual thing happen like they do today  like the guys from seinfeld  they're going to be  making just boatloads of money for the rest of their lives  because they had a much better deal as far as the residuals go  look at football players  no i know  football players  look at me  you know what my first contract was  how much  seven thousand five hundred dollars  wow  seven thousand five hundred dollars  in 1961  five years before you were born 
[03:36:00]  righteous bucks  that's a mere bag of shell  yeah but gas was 25 cents a gallon  right  okay  you know what i could go out  i could go out i could go out in the hollywood  highest-priced restaurant  and wouldn't spend seventy five dollars  can you do that now  yeah  so you need more money than i did  yes  and furthermore i'm retired i said  so i got most of mine  he has a pension coming in he saved it  stop fucking with the residual money  i'm sorry about that  that's alright  he's gonna call me on my 69 residual money  i don't like it  he's calling you old and saying you're broken

[03:38:00]  los angeles times  alright  it's on the second page  who could possibly say something bad  hold on  let's see what they said about deacon jones in the paper  where are we going  turn to the sports section  sports section  oh you're a sports guy  what do you think he's going to be in politics section  i thought  what team is he for  hope he's looking at world events like they're sending deacon over to iraq  wait were you over in fallujah what happened  i was in iraq  you were over there  we're over there  alright uh... let's see  i'll have no problem reading this  oh there's a whole thing on guns down when i woke up

[03:39:00]  that's my real name  that's his real name  david deacon jones  no no  i thought it was deacon  you've been living under a rock  no i don't know  he just knows you as deacon  i call you mr jones  he knows you as deacon  we know you as david  respect  i know him as david  we go way back  it seems that david jones fancies himself a car shark playing host to a game of poker at his home every saturday night  and while it's my civic duty to pass that address on to the local vice squad i find it amusing that david who prefers to be called deacon  is about to feel what it's like to be sacked  uh-oh  anybody anybody who had any experiment with me 
[03:39:30]  would never write that  in a paper would they  has he ever played cards with you  no this guy he is a young  he cover the dodges  yeah  this guy he writes on the second page  you know first of all if i had known he was a second page writer he wouldn't have had the article  cause i don't deal with nothing but front page stuff okay  i hear ya  this guy's on the second page and he's proud of it  well he didn't really say anything that bad  he's saying that he's going to uh...  but he didn't say anything good enough  did you see mr jones on there one time  exactly  that's true 
[03:40:00]  mr jones  mr deacon jones  he's going to turn me in to the police  say i won a poker game every saturday night  he did  he certainly did  well what's your address  you can't get to me man i live behind gates  you can't get to me  you can't get to me  cops can't get to me unless i let them in  well that's uh... that's not that bad  that's great  see that's how you think  it's really not that bad  i use a baseball writer writing about me  i'd question that  what's he know about poker anyway right  baseball writer 
[03:40:30]  get out of here right  we don't want to be responsible for them getting the expense account  right  you know what i take away from that is he had no idea that uh... you were called deacon in your playing days  because it's just a young  you know how old he is  you know how old he is  he's your age  deacon jones everyone knew everyone knows who doesn't know deacon jones  hall of famer  i think you went in in what 1980  around there  my first year of eligibility  nineteen eighty right  see  i know my stuff  that was a good guess  how'd you read that  that guy sounds like a second page faggot  i don't like the fact that he wrote that about you
