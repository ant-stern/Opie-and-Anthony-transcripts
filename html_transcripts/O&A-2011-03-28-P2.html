<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with Sam Roberts hosting alongside the rest of the O&A staff, noting the absence of Ron Bennington.  The show kicked off with a pre-recorded interview with Larry Charles, director of *Borat* and producer of *Seinfeld*, promoting his new documentary *Religulous*.  Charles discussed the film's satirical approach to religion, the potential for backlash, its use of archival footage, and the lack of historical evidence supporting the existence of Jesus, as well as similar stories in other religions.  Following this, Opie and Anthony announced their personal coffee-fetching duties, revealing it was a protest against the lack of interns.  A pre-recorded interview with Joe Cross, from *Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dying*, then aired, promoting his juicing-based weight loss program. This prompted a discussion among the staff about their own diets, featuring humorous banter between Sam Roberts and Roland about Roland's weight and eating habits.  Behind-the-scenes disagreement regarding the segment's relevance was also mentioned.  A comedic segment followed featuring intern Oscar receiving dating advice from Nicole and Stanley T. from the *Morning Mashup*, including a hilarious role-playing exercise showcasing Oscar's awkwardness.  The show included outtakes of Anthony's struggles recording Spanish-language commercials for Strauss Discount Auto, providing further comedic relief.

A later segment shifted to a discussion about a Bruce Springsteen t-shirt and a humorous anecdote involving a juicer and Roland, connected somehow to the "juicer guy" from the earlier Joe Cross segment, though the specifics weren't detailed.  The hosts excitedly anticipated the upcoming guest, actor Danny McBride, speculating about his personality beyond his film roles and reminiscing about a previous, less successful appearance on the show. One host gave *Your Highness* a 97 out of 100 stars.  The segment concluded with promotional plugs for the show's Facebook page, broadcast times, and a mention of the "Ron and Fez" show following. The show ended with the surprising return of Ron Bennington, creating a further humorous moment.  Throughout the broadcast, the overall tone remained lighthearted and irreverent, marked by crude humor and frequent banter amongst the hosts and staff.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The virus. Sirius XR.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Oh yes, it's After Opie and Anthony Live.  I'm Sam Roberts, as the production stated.  ONA are gone, but we keep the channel live because it's just what we do.  The whole staff is still here.  Travis, Danny, Troy, E-Rock, D-Boy, and of course me. 
[00:00:30]  It was a big show today.  Of course we ended with Joe Cross from the movie Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dying.  And there were a couple people who worked for this show  that I thought were going to be part of that segment that weren't.  Oh, I know where this is going.  Well, E-Rock, I didn't know you had a mic.  I mean, a couple people, but we'll get into that a little later on  here on After Opie and Anthony Live.  Were you upset there were no jabs taken at me?  I didn't say anything about you.  You Mr. Defensive today. 
[00:01:00]  Eric Nagel, the sex bagel, is in the house.  Also, probably the story of the day was the rant against their not being interns  and Opie and Anthony going and making a declaration  that they would be getting their own coffee mid-show starting today.  So we'll get into that in a little bit.  But we started with what Ant was doing over his weekend  after two or three years at this point.  Let me see. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah, it was 2008.  So it was three years ago that Religious came out.  We actually had one of the guys who made the movie in studio,  not Bill Maher, but Larry Charles.  He was in studio three years ago to promote Religious.  So Anthony got a chance to check it out over the weekend.  He finally got to see it, and he enjoyed it.  It just would have been helpful if he had done that three years ago.  But we still look back to what happened,  because the rest of us saw it. 
[00:02:00]  And Ant's a busy guy, so why don't you get off his case  for once in your life?  Larry Charles was in.  He directed Borat, and he was an executive producer  on Curb Your Enthusiasm, Entourage, and a whole bunch of other...  Seinfeld.  Yeah, he was a producer on Seinfeld.  Very successful in this industry that we call show business.  Larry Charles was in to promote Religious three years ago.  Not today, but more...  Roland, what do you got your fist up for? 
[00:02:30]  Your wise-ass questions at the end.  Well, we'll get...  I haven't played it yet.  But we'll get into...  You're talking about with Joe Cross.  Oh, yes.  My foot in your asshole.  We'll get into all that first.  But he was a big Troy Kwan fan, I have to say.  We got to pull him in, too, because Troy was...  I heard there was an argument that went on.  I want to talk about it all.  Here's Larry Charles promoting Religious  on After Opie and Anthony Live.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  So Bill wanted to do a thing kind of skewering religion.  I haven't seen it. 
[00:03:00]  I didn't realize the screening was.  Did he interview a bunch of people?  Or what exactly did he do?  Yeah.  Pretty much went around the world interviewing people.  Yeah.  We went all around the world interviewing people.  But that's one layer of the movie.  Then, you know, in the editing process,  we use a lot of archival clips.  We're using great music.  The movie opens with The Seeker by The Who.  So there's a great soundtrack,  great archival clips of Hollywood movies  that are, you know, the absurd Jeffrey Hunter,  blue-eyed, blonde-haired Jesuses,  and stuff like that.  And so it's a real fast-paced mix 
[00:03:30]  of a lot of layers of information.  Bill Maher's making some, you know,  pretty solid points about organized religion.  Then they'll go to a quick clip  from some old-school Jesus movie.  And that was brilliant, man.  Some of those clips just out loud funny.  We were howling at the screening.  There was, I don't want to give it away,  but there was a few that are going to make people  really laugh hard.  Yeah, I hope so.  I mean, you know, again,  what's great about making a documentary  is that you can get those clips for nothing  under the fair use law. 
[00:04:00]  If you can make it clear  that there's some meaning to the clips  that's illuminating the point that you're making,  they give you the clips for free.  So we were able to,  on a very low-budget movie,  able to use a lot of that kind of stuff.  You know, it was great.  Now, what about Backlash?  Anything?  You know, how some people like,  when Dogma came out.  Oh, Dogma!  Dogma!  When Dogma came out,  I know Kevin Smith got a lot of crap  from the Catholic League.  Yeah, I think this is an equal opportunity offender.  With religion, sometimes that doesn't matter.  Yeah, it may not.  It may not.  I mean, people haven't seen it yet, 
[00:04:30]  obviously.  It hasn't come out yet,  so the Backlash hasn't begun.  But again, for me,  the biggest controversy  would not be like protesters  in front of the theater  or anything like that.  It would be people  who would normally be aghast  and offended by this movie  to go in again  on a Saturday night at the mall  and go and see it  and find themselves laughing  despite themselves.  That, to me,  would be the greatest triumph  and the greatest controversy.  So what do you do?  You just present it as ridiculously  as it's presented  by the people  that try to pump this stuff  and it's just funny.  You don't have to do very much.  Yeah, you really don't.  You don't have to say,  what do you believe? 
[00:05:00]  And once people start talking  about the talking snake  or the Garden of Eden  or the big whale  or those stories,  and you realize  they're like children's stories  that we as adults cling to  on some kind of literal level,  that's kind of scary.  As basing your whole existence  on a children's story  kind of a thing.  It's like believing  that Santa Claus,  you know,  it's like,  you're told at 10 years old  that Santa Claus isn't real.  You're not told at 10  that Jesus isn't real.  So you cling to it  for many, many years afterwards.  And of course,  it leads,  the point of the movie  is it's leading to the, 
[00:05:30]  these children's stories  are leading to the end  of the world.  That's the ending  of all the children's stories.  And you know,  the Bible,  the Koran,  the New Testament,  they all have  apocalypse scenarios.  So these kind of silly stories  are taking us  to the end of the world,  which is kind of,  that's the most  religious thing of all.  Yeah,  believing that someone  actually lived inside a well,  you know.  Right.  Well.  That is a silly little story  they put in there.  But people believe it.  Do we have any,  any Bill Donahue?  I know he's had  quite a few problems  with Bill over the years.  Yeah,  I don't know very much about him. 
[00:06:00]  I know he wants  to have a boxing match with Bill.  That's his idea  of a solution to the problems.  Well,  you're going to hear  a lot from Donahue  in the coming weeks.  He's going to be  spearheading this one.  He'll be on,  he'll be on all the news stations.  It'll be good for your movie though.  Exactly.  They all,  you know,  people,  what happens  and it happened to Borat too  is that initially  people are distressed.  Then the movie comes out.  It's kind of successful.  They bask in the 15 minutes  of fame that they get.  They ask for DVDs.  Sasha will sign a DVD  and send it off to them  and then they sue you.  Yeah.  So it's kind of,  that's the story.  Thanks.  You guys do okay 
[00:06:30]  with all the lawsuits  from Borat?  Amazingly enough,  just last week,  the last of the lawsuits  were dismissed.  We set a precedent  in the courts  and hopefully  that'll be usable  when we start getting  the suit on.  They came out of old.  What was the precedent?  The precedent was  that we did our homework.  We had very tight  legal releases.  We had no liability  whatsoever  so the lawsuits  were all founded  to have no merit  whatsoever  so they were all dismissed.  Oh, good for you, man.  Yeah.  Very good.  Yeah.  You guys went after  the Mormons.  Yes.  And Joseph Smith. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  A real scam artist.  But the people are believing.  Look at the stuff  they've built  in the honor of Joseph Smith.  The Mormonism,  which is one of the  fastest growing religions,  has one of the craziest stories.  You know,  I mean,  God is a flesh and blood man.  He actually had  physical intercourse  with Mary.  You know,  if black people  are subhuman  in Mormonism,  they just recently  changed that,  by the way.  But in the Book of Mormon,  black people are considered  to be less than human. 
[00:07:30]  All these things  people didn't know.  If Mitt Romney  had gotten the nomination,  this stuff might have  come to the surface.  But it's pretty amazing  that there's a growing religion  that believes  these kind of things.  When did Joseph Smith live?  In the 1800s.  1800s, okay.  That's when they knew  a lot about everything.  Let me tell you that.  And when you die,  not only are you  facing God,  you're also facing  Joseph Smith.  So that's good.  That's right.  That's right.  And you get your own planet  also.  You get your own planet  if you live a good life 
[00:08:00]  here on Earth.  Can I ask you  what you do  with that planet?  Whatever the hell  you want.  You want a planet?  Invite your white friends.  Yeah,  your white friends.  Yeah.  But is it,  can you,  but if everyone  has their own planet,  then you've got  to invite people over  like,  hey,  you want to come over  to the planet tonight  or else you're alone.  But that's exactly  the movie.  The movie is  asking those questions,  those basic questions  that are like  logical questions  about these things.  How does the planet  thing work?  And nobody thinks  about that deeply.  They just accept it.  So they're all stunned 
[00:08:30]  and shocked  when Bill asks  these basic,  simple questions  about their own  belief system.  Yeah.  And then you guys  went to the  Creation Museum.  I thought that was  fantastic.  I would say  take the family  for sure.  Yeah.  Good one.  And they believe  that dinosaurs  and the humans  walk in the Earth  at the same time.  And not only that,  I'll give away  this one shot.  There was a shot,  I think I said  it earlier anyway,  where a dinosaur  had a saddle on it.  Yes.  Basically saying  not only did we  live together,  we rode dinosaurs  like we ride horses.  Exactly.  And people believed this.  And the most insidious  part of the Creation Museum 
[00:09:00]  is if you walk in there,  it's an amazing place.  It looks just like  the Natural History Museum  here in New York.  So you think,  oh, it's scientific,  but it's all this  kind of quasi-science.  It's all fake science  to justify these  incredibly crazy  belief systems.  They'll always take  science and just  throw it aside.  Like, ah,  now we got to think.  Because for years,  I didn't even hear  the explanation that  man was around  with dinosaurs.  That's a new one.  They just used to say,  no, there were no  such things as dinosaurs. 
[00:09:30]  I don't know  what you're talking about.  They pull up these bones.  We don't know  what they are.  Right, exactly.  And then the science  of it got so good  that people accepted  the fact that,  yes, there were dinosaurs.  So they had to address it  by going,  yeah, well,  we were around  with the dinosaurs.  It still works  into the whole  storybook thing.  Well, what's really  sick and sad about it  is like 1925  was the Scopes trial,  you know,  Inherit the Wind  and all that.  And so we had  really finished  this discussion  like 50, 80 years  ago already,  you know,  that evolution is real  and that creationism  is a story  and all that kind of stuff. 
[00:10:00]  And yet somehow  it has crept back  into the point  that now  they want to teach  creationism next to evolution  in the school system again.  It's like teaching magic  with chemistry,  you know what I mean?  It's very scary.  Alchemy will turn lead  to gold.  I was pretty well informed  going into seeing this movie,  but the one thing  I was not informed about  that you educated me on  was the fact that  our story of Jesus  is a story that was told  many, many times 
[00:10:30]  way before Jesus lived.  Absolutely.  In much older religions,  the story is exactly the same.  And that kind of creeped me out  to find that out.  Well, there's a number  of things about that.  First of all, yes,  there are many, many myths  and legends  of a Jesus-like figure  that predate Christianity,  you know.  That has the same basic story.  He was born on the same,  you know,  these guys were born  on the same day.  They were crucified.  They were resurrected.  They had 12 disciples.  They were shepherds  and all these kind of things,  all the same stuff,  you know.  That's the first thing.  The second thing is,  which was shocking to me 
[00:11:00]  and I discovered  in the making of the movie,  is that there's absolutely  zero evidence  that Jesus even existed.  There's none.  There's no tangible evidence.  There are many writers  writing at the time  of Jerusalem  in the Roman occupation  who were there,  historians who were there,  journalists who were there.  Tons of writing  on that stuff.  Not one mention  of Jesus, basically.  The only mention  of Jesus is in the Gospels,  which those were written  long, long after  he supposedly was dead.  Many, many decades,  even liberally speaking,  it could be as much 
[00:11:30]  as 200 years later  that the Gospels were written  and they don't even match.  Which is odd  because,  and you might say,  wow, well,  it was such a long time ago,  but there are cultures  that predate Jesus  that we have  pretty good information on.  Yeah.  You know,  Egyptian,  Roman Empire,  you know,  those things predating Jesus,  why is it,  you're right,  why isn't there  any tangible evidence?  That's right.  Like we know  there was a King Tut.  Exactly.  There's a body,  there's a tomb,  there's historical documentation. 
[00:12:00]  Right.  So where,  where is Jesus?  And Pontius Pilate existed,  all those other people  did exist,  and they were written about  very extensively,  but the name,  Jesus,  this cult leader Jesus  is never mentioned  in any of those  historical accounts.  Did you guys address it all?  I heard someone talk,  you're a scientist,  about why people  become religious  or believe in a deity,  and something about  how it's kind of put there,  perhaps by nature,  as kind of like,  because everyone has  natural enemies  except for us,  so that's kind of like  a stop for us,  or something for us  to kind of,  to keep ourselves 
[00:12:30]  from going completely over it.  I also think it's a hope.  You've got to have  some kind of hope  that you're not just  going to die  and it ends.  So we're so self-important,  we think that we can't  just turn into dust,  that we have to become  some part of some  collective Borg  or something that  makes us feel better.  It's a gigantic ego problem.  Right.  And then you interviewed  two Jewish gentlemen,  that actually went over  to Iran.  Yes. 
[00:13:00]  And what do they believe?  Well, this one rabbi  went to the Holocaust  denial conference in Iran  because he doesn't believe  that Israel should exist.  That's a whole movement  in Judaism,  an extremist movement  in Judaism  that doesn't believe  that the Israelis  have earned Israel.  They shouldn't have Israel  and so this guy  actually kind of hangs out  with the president of Iran  and denies the Holocaust  and tries to destroy Israel.  That's his thing.  He's a hardcore Jew  with the payas  and everything  and he's over in Iran  supporting what...  Wow, that's very odd. 
[00:13:30]  Yes.  The hell's he thinking?  Like, where does he want  the Jews to go?  He believes that the Jews  don't deserve the land  until they've earned it somehow  and they haven't been  holy enough yet to earn it  and he's waiting  for some sign, I guess.  Does he say  where they should go though  or no?  He wants them to hang out  in Muncie upstate here  until they get the word  from the Messiah.  The sign is apparently  going to be a mushroom cloud  launched from Iran.  That's right.  That's a good sign.  That's the one.  Make him move.  That's the one  that he wants to see. 
[00:14:00]  After O&A,  it's live.  That's what it is.  After Opie and Anthony live,  I am Sam Roberts.  That was Larry Charles.  He was in Promoting  Religulous,  the movie that we talked about  at the beginning of the show.  If you missed  the beginning of the show,  I would recommend  checking it out.  The replay starts  at 3 p.m.  Eastern time, obviously.  Another thing that we talked about  towards the beginning  as the Ron and Fez interns  begin to set up  for the Ron and Fez show today,  another thing we talked about  towards the beginning of the show 
[00:14:30]  in like the second hour,  I think it was,  was of course  the lack of interns  that we have around here.  It's been a while  since we had any interns.  Ron and Fez still have  their interns.  We do not.  And it's been an issue,  a point of contention  with Opie and Anthony  a few times.  Today,  they certainly  let their voices  be heard  on that issue.  And  they went as far  as to say  that because  we have no interns,  they don't think  the staff should  always be running  the errands. 
[00:15:00]  And Opie and Anthony  said that from now on  to prove a point,  to make a point,  that they themselves  would be going out  to get their own coffee.  I assume  that it was a joke.  I caught up with Opie  in the hallway  and I asked him just that.  Opie,  you went on the air  and said since  we don't have interns,  you're going to start  going out for your own coffee  in the middle of the show.  Are you actually  going to do that?  Well,  not just me.  Little Jimmy Norton  will be doing the same  because the coffee  around here  really,  really sucks.  And interns, 
[00:15:30]  that was their job  to get us coffee.  And if they're not  going to allow us  to have interns  around here,  we have to  take it upon ourselves  to get our own coffee now.  Yes,  I'm absolutely going to do  that starting tomorrow.  Know why?  Why?  Because I'm a coffee diva.  Are you worried  about the effect  that it'll have  on the on-air product?  Or do you think  it'll be positive?  I'm hoping it doesn't  affect the on-air  product.  So I'm not too worried  about it,  to be honest with you.  And if I do get fired 
[00:16:00]  over this,  it doesn't matter  because I have a fat,  a really fat bank account.  Must be nice.  It is nice.  It's real nice.  Oh yeah,  it's nice.  Coffee diva!  Well, I for one  certainly hope  that they don't  get fired.  Mainly because  without Opie and Anthony  there's no after  Opie and Anthony Live.  E-Rock,  what would you do  if Opie and Anthony  got fired  for requesting interns?  One,  I could probably  sleep better.  I might lose some weight.  I don't know. 
[00:16:30]  Sounds like all pluses  for you, actually.  Yeah,  it kind of does.  Well,  I'd actually miss  working here.  I'd miss you.  Oh,  that sucks.  Yeah,  I don't know why.  I would miss Roland.  Roland,  are you worried  about Opie and Anthony  quitting  because they have  no interns?  Or not quitting,  getting fired  for requesting?  No.  No?  You're still mad at me?  No.  About the thing  in the hallway  with Joe Cross?  Just a little bit.  Well,  we'll do that 
[00:17:00]  right next  because Troy  is also running around  eager to talk about juicing.  What were you going to say,  E-Rock?  I was going to say,  with the coffee thing,  do you think maybe  we could do the old  walkover setup?  Like,  they could just  take the wireless,  get up,  go down the elevator,  and still broadcast  while they're doing  the coffee?  Yeah,  I feel like that  would be a wonderful thing.  That's a great ideal role.  And we played  Rich Voss at Starbucks  last week  on After Opie and Anthony Live.  We could get some comedians.  We could do a whole road show  with O&A going down  to get their coffee.  Yeah,  we get the old  hot dog truck.  I don't even know 
[00:17:30]  where that is.  We'll have to find that.  I'm sure we could find it  or Mars  or someone else  could build a new one.  I mean,  who knows?  It's a world of possibilities.  I think it would be  other people besides Mars.  You don't think  it would be Mars?  Why not?  He doesn't do any work,  you're saying?  No,  I didn't say that.  But what are you implying?  It takes intelligence.  I see.  Well,  just to prove  how much the interns  do add to the  Opie and Anthony show,  I thought it only appropriate  that we highlight  one of them.  And this  is intern Oscar 
[00:18:00]  getting coached  on how to talk to women.  Our buddies Nicole  and Stanley T  from the Morning Mashup  also stopped by for this.  Intern Oscar  and learning how to  pick up girls  on After Opie and Anthony Live.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  Oh,  the mic.  It's Nicole.  Nicole.  He gets really nervous  in front of girls.  Nicole.  Nicole, yeah.  See?  Wow,  look at him.  He's giggling like...  Come on,  I get nervous  in front of Nicky.  Nicole, 
[00:18:30]  get over here.  This is Oscar,  our intern.  Hi, Oscar.  Hi, Nicole.  How are you?  I'm good.  He's extremely nervous.  I can see that.  Now,  show us how you would  talk to a girl.  Make believe you guys  are in a bar.  Okay?  How would you try  to pick up Nicole?  Oof,  man.  I'll be,  are you from around here?  Wow.  Come on, dude,  really?  Yeah,  that was what I was going to say.  Yes,  I'm from around here.  Oh, cool.  You want a drink?  Yeah.  No?  No,  yes,  I said yes.  Okay,  cool.  Why does that happen to you?  I don't know.  I was fine a second ago. 
[00:19:00]  Okay.  No,  you weren't.  You're fine.  You're fine.  I don't bite.  Okay,  cool.  Unless you want me to bite.  What's your name?  Nicole?  I'm Nicole.  That's like my favorite name.  I mean,  if I ever have a daughter,  I would name her Nicole.  He's already thinking kids.  That's sexual.  He's already thinking kids.  You don't equate a daughter  with a girl  that you're trying to like.  Oh,  no,  well,  that's because in the moment.  Do you want to sleep with me  or do you want to?  Interact.  Maybe interact.  You know,  I have a chat.  You want coffee?  Coffee talk.  Not coffee, 
[00:19:30]  maybe a beer.  Oh,  that's fine too.  You ever done the funnels?  No.  Funnels?  Yeah,  funneling.  No.  Yeah,  like when I was 16.  Awesome.  Yeah.  So are you from around here?  Yeah.  No,  not here.  I mean,  from Morristown.  What's up?  Oh,  sorry.  It's just.  Oh,  dear.  Focus,  man.  Focus.  Focus,  man.  Focus.  She's interested in you.  Focus.  Yeah.  I just want to know something.  Sure,  sure.  Why is this happening?  You need like a value or something?  No,  no.  So why are you holding your mic so tight? 
[00:20:00]  I just broke it a second ago,  so I'm just holding on to it.  Honey,  there's nothing to be nervous about.  I know.  My nose is itching like crazy.  So itching.  Why?  I'm out with it.  I heard a morphine does that to you,  but like.  Are you on morphine?  No,  no,  no,  no,  but I don't know why I said that.  What did I say that for?  I just.  Yeah.  So what else?  No,  there's a love.  You're out of school.  Are you in school?  Are you out of school?  I'm out of school.  Yeah.  What school did you go attended?  There.  What sort of thing you go attended? 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  Attended there.  Hey there.  College did I go?  Yeah,  yeah.  What school?  Yeah.  I went to Ithaca College.  Nice,  nice.  I have a,  actually,  you might know my friend.  You know what you know?  Do you know Steve?  Do you know Steve?  Um,  04.  I graduated 04.  Oh,  okay.  You probably don't know the guy.  His name is Ben.  I don't know.  Yeah.  He's an independent filmmaker from Brooklyn.  Oh,  cool.  Yeah.  Cool.  That's awesome.  What do you do?  Just be weird mostly.  It's not my hobby.  That too.  Actually,  yeah.  I'm actually normal outside the studio though.  What's up? 
[00:21:00]  Is it outside the studio?  Is it that you're nervous in here?  Yeah.  Is it nervous with girls?  What's the main issue?  I guess,  yeah,  both.  In here and with girls.  You should send him in the streets with a camera and have him talk to chicks.  We get this guy some shots.  His job here is to make the coffee nervous.  So what's your favorite film of all time?  My favorite film of all time?  I don't know.  I'm a pretty big fan of Pulp Fiction.  Yeah?  You like Forrest Gump?  I do.  You sound like Forrest Gump right now.  Exactly.  Is that one of your favorite films? 
[00:21:30]  Yeah,  I look up to the guy.  I mean,  Forrest Gump.  That's actually my...  You look up to Forrest Gump?  Yeah,  Forrest Gump.  Why?  This can't be real.  You can't write shit like this.  It's a great character.  He's such an honest and pure and just at the same.  You just look at him and it's like,  wow,  such...  Fucking retard.  No,  but...  Well,  that's what makes the movie funny.  Oh,  so,  what's up?  What are we doing?  She actually does a show.  Oh,  you're on a show right now?  You're doing a show?  Yeah.  Oh,  that's cool.  Are you single or taken?  I am not single.  Oh,  cool.  I just had to think about it for a second.  He goes,  oh,  cool,  cool, 
[00:22:00]  good.  Good,  I have no chance in hell with you.  Great.  I just wanted to reconfirm it.  Oscar,  what do you like about Nicole?  Definitely the eyes.  They're nice,  deep,  yeah.  Love the hair.  Thank you.  What else?  What else?  The sandals,  sandals.  My flip-flops?  Flip-flops,  yeah,  yeah,  I don't know why he said that.  Anything else?  Skipped right over the tits,  didn't he?  The shirt's pretty cool.  The shirt?  The shirt's pretty cool.  Yeah,  yeah.  I'm really sorry that this is,  we need to work on this.  Absolutely, 
[00:22:30]  yeah,  no problem.  She doesn't mind you talking about our breasts.  Yeah.  What do you think of our breasts?  Yeah,  they're fine.  They're pretty fine.  They're fine.  They're fine.  That's what's fine.  They're adequate.  They're,  they're average.  He starts answering,  like,  your,  your answer  before you're done with it.  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah,  yeah,  right,  yeah.  You'd be like,  oh,  what's your favorite film?  Well,  I like Pulp Fit.  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah,  yeah,  yeah,  I understand,  right,  right.  You're not really listening.  Have you ever had a girlfriend before?  Yeah,  yeah,  I had a couple times. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah,  it was like long term,  long term,  it was just a couple.  What was the problem with the girlfriend?  Oh,  um,  well,  the first one,  it was just,  uh,  cheating and,  and shit like that.  And,  uh,  the second one,  it was just,  uh,  something about marriage.  And I said,  like,  the first date we went out,  she didn't like what I said,  and then we still,  like,  she stuck out for a while,  and then she just,  no,  I said,  I didn't want to get married to both 35,  you know,  I said,  I'll get a job and stuff,  and,  and then get my shit together.  You started talking about marriage on a first date?  No,  she started talking,  and then I said,  I wasn't interested,  and then,  that's what happened. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  Wow,  I feel really dumb.  ask me who she cheated with.  Who?  Anybody else.  I don't know why.  Anyways,  I hope everything works out,  and you can find a nice girl.  Yeah,  no,  I'm not.  It's not worried or anything.  You don't see me.  I'm not worried or anything.  No,  it's just.  You got a show to do,  do you?  No,  I'm done.  You're making me nervous,  though.  Oh,  they would drag me out of here.  Give him a pointer.  I don't even know where to start with you.  Oh,  wow.  I think you just need to build a little bit more confidence. 
[00:24:00]  Okay.  Maybe try not to stutter so much,  maybe practice in the mirror talking without,  without,  like,  today,  junior.  Like,  you need to really.  Okay.  Right there,  Stan,  he might be able to help you.  He's a ladies man.  Awesome.  So he could probably,  he could probably help you more than I could,  because you're just,  you're blowing me away with.  You like black guys,  Oscar?  Yeah,  of course.  Stan,  Stan,  of course you're alone.  Stan,  can you help a brother out?  Oh,  man,  this is a fucking train wreck for real.  Yeah,  he's a disaster.  All right,  what you need is an exit strategy,  because talking is not your strong point, 
[00:24:30]  okay?  This is what you do,  okay?  You get a card,  you put your number on the card,  you take Nicole,  look at it,  look,  stand over here for a second and look at my mannerism when I speak to her,  okay?  Nicole,  get back on the mic like I'm talking to you.  Here you go.  Oh,  man,  listen,  I gotta go,  but you are very,  very,  very sweet.  Oh,  and then he slips the card to her.  And then you don't have to talk so much.  And now he's gotta go.  I'd love to know more about you,  but I gotta go,  but,  and leave, 
[00:25:00]  and leave,  out gone.  Cool,  cool.  You know what I mean?  Yeah,  yeah.  Exit strategy.  Exit strategy.  You got three seconds,  you need three seconds.  But he's gotta talk to her then at some point.  I know.  At least he can regroup,  get his mind,  he can regroup,  get his mind together,  and think of something.  Yeah,  get his mind together.  All right,  try that.  I like that.  Let's have Oscar try that.  Try it?  Yeah,  just like you heard Stanley T do it.  Pretend it's your name.  From the morning mashup,  by the way.  It's one.  Nicole,  Nicole,  I would like to stick around and learn more about you,  but then here's my card.  Give me a call.  No. 
[00:25:30]  No,  no,  no.  You gotta,  no,  no.  Nicole,  I'd like to stick around.  No.  You can,  you gotta go.  You're busy,  busy,  busy,  busy.  Girls like confidence and arrogance.  Believe it or not,  they don't want to tell you that,  but they like confidence and arrogance.  You go,  just look at her body language,  just go,  baby,  I gotta go,  but please,  give me a call.  Okay,  try it.  Now you try it.  And lower the voice a little bit.  Yeah,  bring it down a little bit.  Baby,  I gotta go.  Here you go.  Here you go.  Here you go. 
[00:26:00]  Here you go.  Like a fucking telegram.  Like he's in the fucking deli.  Oh,  you called my number.  Come on,  man.  You gotta be smooth.  I gotta go.  Here you go.  And the word baby doesn't really roll out of him.  No,  it really doesn't.  Maybe try listen,  girl.  I gotta go.  Let's try that.  All right.  And slow it down.  Relax.  Relax.  All right.  Relax.  Listen,  girl,  I have to go.  Here we go.  No,  what's the thing?  I swear,  he's handing her the card like a telegram.  You gotta do it.  Maybe you can get a little bit closer, 
[00:26:30]  right?  Try this approach.  Nicole,  play with me.  Hey,  listen,  I gotta go.  Oh.  I'd love for you to call me.  Oh,  you'd love for me.  Oh,  shit.  Get the fuck out of me.  Get gone.  Leave the whole building.  Deploy.  You know what I mean?  I don't know.  Can you handle whispering in my ear?  Maybe.  Try it.  All right,  cool,  cool.  Yeah,  now there's a whisper in the ear.  Look,  I gotta go.  Come here,  go.  Hey,  hey,  hey. 
[00:27:00]  Better.  That's a market improvement.  Cool.  Market improvement.  Hey,  I gotta go.  People should get,  should be fired for not bringing Oscar to our attention before today.  I know.  He's been here for months.  This guy's a gold mine.  Listen,  good luck.  Nice meeting you.  You're a very sweet guy,  and I'm sure it'll all work out.  Awesome,  yeah.  What's up?  Do it.  Do what?  Do it right now.  Do it.  Kiss a good butt.  Bye-bye.  Plot your dick.  Plot out your dick.  Love the ONA show.  See y'all later.  All right.  Thank you so much.  Thank you. 
[00:27:30]  Wow,  that exit strategy is pretty good.  That was good.  That's a good move.  You learned something there,  Oscar?  Yeah,  definitely.  Everybody does.  Everybody doesn't get to rehearse with a girl like that.  No,  no.  Man,  no.  After ONA,  live.  It's after Opie and Anthony live.  That was intern Oscar learning how to pick up girls.  Of course,  our friends Colin Cain and Jackie the Joke Man were in,  along with Ryan,  not Ryan,  Stanley and Nicole from the morning mashup,  just illustrating some of the great tasks that we have our interns do here on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:28:00]  Roland,  you came in here like a fireball when we first started after Opie and Anthony live this morning.  Upset with me.  Yes.  Was this because of my post-show interview with Joe Cross?  Oh,  no,  no,  it's your Quad X t-shirt size joke.  Well,  Quad X.  This is Joe Cross,  because I was saying at the beginning,  and E-Rock thought I was directing it at him.  I haven't said,  I thought there were some members of the show that maybe could have been incorporated into the Joe Cross segment today. 
[00:28:30]  He was promoting the movie Fat Sick and Nearly Dying, where he'd lost like 100 pounds by juicing.  And he said that's the only diet that worked for him, and he gets all his nutrition and keeps his energy up.  I thought that some of the people involved in the show should have been involved in this segment.  Like Eric,  yeah.  So when these questions weren't raised to him, I thought that if I had the questions, the listeners probably would too, and that somebody should bring them up.  So here, Roland, if you don't mind, is my post-show interview. 
[00:29:00]  Like I could stop you.  With Joe Cross.  Joe Cross, you come to the Opie and Anthony show, you talk about not only the weight that you've lost, but the weight that you have helped people lose.  But the first guy you see when you walk into this building is Roland.  What goes on in your head?  Oh, I see a lot of energy in Roland.  A lot of energy.  A lot of excess energy, but I believe he was carrying around a lot more before, and he's now on the right path.  I mean, we were talking earlier, and he went on a hamburger run like two years ago, and he wouldn't even think about doing that now, would you, Roland? 
[00:29:30]  No.  I mean, he'd think about it.  I don't know.  I think Roland's converted.  Really?  I think he's a mad juicer now, actually.  If I come back here in a year, I won't recognize Roland.  Did you know that they made Bruce Springsteen shirts that big?  I don't know.  What is it, a triple X?  At least.  It's a two X.  I reckon it's all, and I reckon he'll be down to a medium if he keeps the juice up over the next six months.  You're a nice guy. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, well, you know, I think Roland's a nice guy.  He is.  Thanks a lot.  Okay, you're welcome.  He really is a nice guy.  He doesn't want to hurt anybody's feelings, but what the hell were you talking to him about that you don't go on hamburger runs anymore?  What?  What is a hamburger run?  Just going out to get burgers?  No.  Because you go on hamburger runs every week.  No, I don't.  We went to Wendy's last week.  I was out there.  Where did you go instead?  Buffalo chicken sandwich place?  Roland, you might have a juice every now and then, but you're not juicing. 
[00:30:30]  And you haven't, I don't know, how big he thought you, how much weight have you, have you lost weight recently?  Yeah, like 20 pounds.  Oh, well, congratulations.  Do you think you're going to be able to keep this up, or do you think those harpies that are Wendy's are just going to call you in?  No, Wendy's won't call me in.  Who will?  Shake Shack.  Shake Shack.  Like, were you upset that that's what I chose to interview Joe Cross about?  I figured it would be between me or Eric.  What did he say after that? 
[00:31:00]  Well, he said he's praying for Eric, though, because he said he's a big bloke.  You're just trying, I think you're trying to divert attention.  Yeah, pretty much.  T-Rock, are you hearing this?  Yeah, I don't think I even met the guy.  I was doing other stuff, so I wasn't around for this.  Have you tried juicing?  Yeah, I did.  That lasted two days.  He juiced pizza face?  Obvious joke.  Good one.  Yeah, I also love when Roland makes fat jokes.  Now, Roland, are you, he said that he replaced, like, burgers and pizza with juices. 
[00:31:30]  Yes.  You've not done that.  And on the weekends, I do.  On the weekends?  Yes.  Two out of seven days a week.  And also some other days, too.  I will say this for Roland.  Like, he does show up in the morning with those, you know, green and brown and red juices or whatever he's drinking.  But he ruins it when lunchtime comes around.  But then when we leave, he goes back to the juice place and has that for dinner.  Yeah, so they have one good meal.  So, Iraq, tell me this.  What lasted longer, juicing or the South Beach diet? 
[00:32:00]  Wow, it could be a dead heat.  Well, I think the South Beach.  And why did you stop juicing?  It was too fucking expensive.  It is.  I said, I'm not doing this shit.  Troy.  Yes.  You're a man who is making much, you make, for the record, do you make the same salary as Iraq?  No.  More or less?  Less.  Much less or just a little less?  I'm not quite sure of exactly what he makes, but I would assume it's a significant amount.  Significantly less.  Yeah, we don't know the numbers.  But significantly less than Iraq. 
[00:32:30]  You are, yeah.  But if we were back in medieval days, Iraq and I would be kings.  That's right.  You are very regal looking.  Or in the Pacific Coast region.  Yeah.  Samoan.  You are, yeah, you do look like a couple of Samoans.  You, Troy, are like the number one juicing guy in Sirius right now, right?  I'd like to think so, yeah.  Because you, before we even talked about this guy, you come in here every morning with your  green juice.  Yeah.  And you replace breakfast and lunch with juicing.  Yes.  And you think it's made an impactful, impactful impact on you, a positive impact on your life? 
[00:33:00]  Oh, yeah.  It changed my life.  It really did.  Really?  I mean, once you start doing it, I mean, you just have a lot of energy and I have-  And you wear tight sweaters.  Well, and you just, you start to see your body change and you're like, this is for the better.  But you weren't fat before.  What did it do?  No, but I was eating shitty.  You know what I mean?  And when you eat shitty, it doesn't, you're, you're, I mean, it's like fuel.  It's like putting gas in your car.  You put shitty fuel in it, it's going to run like shit if you put, you know.  So you're a premium fuel right now.  I'm at fucking high octane, baby. 
[00:33:30]  I'm bodega fuel.  Yeah.  Roland's just looking for a discount.  Whenever he can get the cheapest gas, he'll put it in his system.  But you're a sweet ass there, buddy.  I also heard that while you were bragging about how great juicing was, there were some arguments  going on behind the scenes.  I wasn't privy to them, but I was told that you were getting into arguments with juicing  versus non-juicing or something.  No, I think there was some people that were just questioning.  Who?  I mean, you know. 
[00:34:00]  Why don't you say it?  I'm asking you because I wasn't there.  Well, there were people that were there that just didn't think that it fit into.  Who was there?  Well, if they want to say, they can say it.  Who witnessed it?  Eric, did you witness it?  No, I was in the back.  I had no idea.  Roland?  No, I was with the publicist.  Is everybody going to pussy out right now?  Well, go ahead.  You know.  I don't.  I wasn't there.  You do.  Well, I was told you and Danny were arguing.  There wasn't really an argument.  It was just a discussion of, you know, does this person really belong on this show?  And I just said, you know, everybody's health is important and it should be. 
[00:34:30]  I heard it got heated.  I don't know if it really, I mean, I don't give a shit.  Do you know what I mean?  Like, if I think it's a good segment for the show, he didn't think so.  And we're both entitled to believe whatever we want to believe.  I mean.  Is this the positivity that juicing brings you?  It just, it just.  Did it cleanse your soul?  My soul is fine.  But it just, I don't care what, I mean, if they want to do it, cool.  If they don't, they don't.  But I'm telling you that there are a lot of positive effects from doing a juice diet. 
[00:35:00]  And if you're looking to lose weight, if you're looking to feel healthy, if you're looking to feel good about yourself, it's a good thing to do.  You know?  And that's, that's that.  Who do you think is better?  Joe Cross, the juicing guy, or Alex Jones?  You got to pick one.  Oh, man.  You can only hang out with one of the two of them.  They're both fucking awesome.  Those are your two lifestyle choices.  Juicing, conspiracies.  So.  Alex Jones does know Charlie Sheen.  That's true.  Alex Jones has some hookups.  But Joe Cross, the juicer, is Australian. 
[00:35:30]  So, who do we pick?  And I would assume since he's Australian, he probably knows Mel Gibson.  So, who do we pick?  Alex Jones.  Because it's all about the conspiracies right now.  But Joe Cross did love Troy, though.  He gave him a lot of props.  Did he?  What?  That's because he's juicing.  Yeah.  Yeah, but there's also, if you're interested in more information, Fat, Sick, and Nearly  Dead is a great documentary.  It's coming out this week in theaters.  But there's another documentary that you can find called The Beautiful Truth.  Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.  What are we promoting? 
[00:36:00]  A competition?  No, it's not a competition.  I mean, it's already out there.  You can find it online for free.  Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.  No, whatever.  Roller, what are we promoting?  Wendy's, baby.  That's right.  Now, Ant did a bit earlier today when he did Don West.  This is going back to the old days.  Don West has been a staple of the Opie and Anthony show for a long time.  Ant started doing Don West in Spanish after a prostitute story.  If you didn't hear it, you've got to just start listening to the whole show  so I don't have to keep telling you to listen to the replay, because you should have heard it. 
[00:36:30]  But this was not the first time that Ant has tried to speak Spanish.  He's a bilingual millionaire.  Very intelligent, hilarious, and bilingual, Anthony.  And this was dating back to how old, Iraq, more or less?  Like a few years ago.  This is like five or more years ago.  Somewhere in there.  Cinco años in Spanish.  This was Anthony's first attempt, at least on the air, to do Spanish.  And this is when he was doing a live read?  Yeah.  And he thought he would do it in Spanish.  Well, they explained it in the bit here. 
[00:37:00]  Well, then, Iraq, why would we do it?  Let's let them do it.  I'm so in playa.  Right here.  What are you saying, Roland?  I'm so in playa.  Which means?  Fat person playa.  You're calling Iraq a fat person?  All right, we're done.  Can I ask you something?  Yes, sir.  What's going on with you doing Spanish commercials?  I'm really confused, seriously.  Something is going on.  Is this legit?  Here's the deal.  Is it fake? 
[00:37:30]  Here's the deal.  Somebody came to me, one of the salespeople, and said, could you do a tag for Strauss,  which I do a lot of the tags for Strauss.  Now, a tag in the radio biz is that five or six seconds you hear at the end of a commercial.  Yeah, after the Strauss guy talks.  It's like, save now on Strauss, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Right.  They want it in Spanish.  So I kind of laugh.  Wait, wait, wait.  Todd.  Yeah.  They really want it in Spanish, or they want to just fool around?  I don't know.  They just said they want it in Spanish.  Do you think you could do it in Spanish?  I go, I don't know Spanish. 
[00:38:00]  Spanish?  They go, oh, well.  We have that many Spanish listeners?  I thought we had like two.  We're trying to get our ratings up with the ethnic.  So Strauss is serious.  They want the tags in Spanish to reach their Spanish listeners.  Yes, but I don't know Spanish.  But, you know, you spell it for me, help me out.  I was going to just read through it.  Say, what the hell?  So I did.  And I think we have audio of you.  I'm a good soldier.  We have audio of Anthony doing Spanish. 
[00:38:30]  Doing the tag?  Hey, I think that was butthead.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Well, Steve's in here.  Steve's part of this project.  Steve knows Spanish.  How well did Anthony do with the Spanish tags for Strauss?  Yeah, it was awful.  Because I don't know Spanish, so I'm reading it, and he's like, no, it's this word, that word.  Well, it was a ten-second tag that was supposed to be done in Spanish.  Now, we have a hard enough time.  You've got to admit, Opie, when you do a tag and they say you've got ten seconds,  the commercial runs 50 seconds, now it leaves ten seconds for you to put the tag in. 
[00:39:00]  And they put, like, 15 or 20 seconds worth of words, so you've got to talk really fast.  That's why it's like, you know, save the day on Strauss, blah, blah, blah, blah.  You know, you've got to do it fast.  And forget the fact that it's in Spanish, and people that speak Spanish fluently can fit  20 seconds worth of copy into 30 seconds.  Right, but me, I can't do that.  So this really is legit, right?  Oh, yeah.  Totally.  Yeah.  Totally.  This is how it's done.  I was like, okay, I'll do it.  I don't care.  So Steve has the outtakes of you trying to speak Spanish to do a Spanish tag for Strauss 
[00:39:30]  Discount Auto.  Yeah.  I mean, I helped about with the pronunciations a little bit.  Come on.  How popular are we getting?  I thought it would be.  The only reason I agreed to it, I thought it would kind of be funny.  Oh, and it was.  All right.  So these are the outtakes, more or less?  Well, you can hear me in the background feeding the lines, the words, because I don't know.  All right.  Here it is. 
[00:40:00]  This will be funny to someone out there that speaks Spanish.  Anthony.  Doing Spanish tags now for this radio show.  Esta semana en Strauss Discount Auto.  See?  Wait a minute.  Wait, wait, wait.  See?  I was doing it like they do on the, um...  Because I was doing it like you do it on the Spanish TV stations.  I love when you can pick out one word.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what I was doing.  El Houston, Texas.  So I was putting that guy's voice on.  Strauss Discount Auto.  I was trying to do it like I did, like I heard it when I was a kid. 
[00:40:30]  Del mundo.  Michael Tyson.  Madison Square Garden.  Right.  Boxio.  All right.  Let's continue.  Buhias Autolite con cabeza de cobra.  Cobra.  Cobra.  What?  I just say 59.  Oh, great.  Yeah, exactly.  Totally. 
[00:41:00]  All right.  Buhias.  Buhias, right?  Okay.  Buhias Autolite con cabeza de cobra e...  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah, eh, wah, wah?  Come on.  How does it...  That's like...  This is like...  Out of hand.  It's like a Jackie Chan movie, you know, where he has to speak English and he just doesn't, 
[00:41:30]  and they feed him the lines.  Oh, my God.  Ah, he go here.  It's kind of funny to hear you doing your voice in Spanish.  Of course.  Nueve.  Cincuenta y nueve centavos con el...  Envío.  Envío del coupon de...  Reembolso.  Reembolso de...  Treenta centavos.  Have fun. 
[00:42:00]  Now this one.  Wait, how many did he have to do, Steve?  He had to do...  Like two...  It amounted to what it looked like, two tags.  Yeah, it looked like on paper it was two tags, but it was really just supposed to be ten seconds.  Mark from Brooklyn, great one.  Anthony speaking Spanish sounds like Dracula learning to read.  I mean, every four words he had to stop.  Yeah.  It wasn't spelt phonetically.  Yeah, exactly.  Do we have the final product somewhere?  Because this is like the outtake.  Yeah, as a matter of fact, it's... 
[00:42:30]  This is like listening to a kid with Down Syndrome read aloud from a Stephen Hawking essay.  Well, the final...  Oh my God, that's not Spanish.  All I heard was, rock the rock the taco bell.  The final thing I had to cut down, I had to cut the tag in half and compress it so that it would fit within the...  Yeah, because I can't talk that fast.  How would you talk that fast?  All right, let's listen a little more here.  Para encender...  Para encender...  Y acelerar...  Y acelerar...  Y acelerar...  Y acelerar... 
[00:43:00]  Su auto...  Suavemente...  Suavemente...  Nada se compara a las...  Bujías...  Bujías...  He's feeding it a lot.  Autolite de Strauss Discount Auto.  Good luck.  Yeah, I said, good luck putting that together, Steve.  That's it, right there, huh?  Yeah, that is the Spanish fake Fred Flintstone, Mike from Newark. 
[00:43:30]  That's messed up.  Anthony dropped the chalupa.  Everybody's a smartass.  After ONA, it's live.  That's what it is.  After Opie and Anthony live, I'm Sam Roberts.  That was Anthony learning Spanish for the first time.  We caught a little bit of Anthony's Spanish earlier in the show today.  Again, if you missed it, replay at 3 p.m. Eastern.  This is a sad day, folks, because for the first time in the history of After Opie and Anthony live, 
[00:44:00]  we are not joined by Ron Bennington.  There's an empty chair there.  How are you doing, Sam?  That's Roland doing his impressions again.  We are not joined by Ron Bennington.  I hope that he wasn't carted off to jail with some of the jury duty complications.  I don't know.  I didn't get any tweets from G-Baby spoiling what was going on on Ron and Fez today.  So I don't know what's going to happen.  But I'm sure whatever it is, it's going to be wonderful, magical, and hilarious, as it always is. 
[00:44:30]  Roland?  No.  What are you looking at there?  Oh, boy.  The Golden Corral commercial.  Yeah, there was a commercial for Golden Corral, and Roland was distracted.  Yes, E-Rock.  I know you're saying it's a little sad that without Mr. Bennington being here.  Yeah.  But should we be concerned that I don't see any of them here?  Usually this booth is packed with...  No, no, Mark Zios, that hits one if you need them.  Oh, Jesus.  Well, besides from him, I don't see anybody here.  So should we just go along?  We should be concerned, but you know what? 
[00:45:00]  It's Ron and Fez's time.  We have to go.  So Ron and Fez will be here live, even though we're without Ron Bennington at the moment.  He'll be here in a couple minutes, so stay tuned.  It's...  This has been after Opie and Anthony...  What the...  No!  No!  Not like this!  It can't be!  It's him! 
[00:45:30]  It's Ron Bennington, everybody!  I don't get the big crash sound, the breaking glass coming in.  It did.  That was it.  Oh, was that it?  You didn't put your headphones on.  I never do.  Oh, that's okay.  Tittinitis.  But I do want to keep that going on a constant basis.  I don't want to let your parents down.  I got to be here for the Roberts.  I'm sure, because they said over the weekend, you can't do this on your own, Sam.  You're not cut out for this business.  They said that to him?  No.  Oh.  But you do seem to partner up quite a bit.  Well, I mean, everybody needs a partner in radio, I guess. 
[00:46:00]  Tell that to Mr. Rush Limbaugh.  Roland, nice to see you.  Darkness on the Edge of Town?  Yes.  Yeah, he's rocking that shirt today.  Roland got mad at me because I made fun of him in front of the juicing guy.  Why won't Roland ever wear a Tunnel of Love t-shirt?  I've never seen that.  You never wear any of the non-E Street band stuff?  Yeah, none.  None of the solo work?  No.  What did you do to him in front of the juicer guy?  Well, I actually just asked the juicer guy if he was horrified when he saw Roland, and  then I asked the juicer guy if he knew that they made Bruce Springsteen shirts that were 
[00:46:30]  that big.  See, that's awful.  And Roland had just gotten done telling the guy that he had been juicing and losing weight,  so it kind of blew up that whole spot.  Pretty much.  Roland, you said you're going to be back on top this week, and you are the juicing guy  booked in here today.  Do we have any announcements for tomorrow's O&A show?  Danny McBride.  Whoa!  What's he doing for QVC these days?  Who?  What's he moving?  No, Danny McBride, the actor. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, the great actor.  For me, he's got it down.  Seven to eight.  Now, here's why I love that Danny McBride's coming in.  I never get to hear him or see him in a regular mode.  This will be the first time.  Yeah, so I'm not even sure who he is when he's not on stage.  I'm very, very...  He's Danny McBride.  Yeah, I get that, but I mean, I don't know what his personality is when he's not playing  a character.  Because when I see him on...  Yeah.  I've seen him do like some late night talk show.  A lot of that stuff is so scripted that it doesn't feel comfortable. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  They just give you the opening to tell your story that you already worked out.  Well, he's been on the show before a couple years ago.  Before it blew up.  Before it blew up.  And he was great.  I paid no attention to him then.  Of course not.  Now I'm like, holy shit, Danny McBride.  And his movie, Your Highness, I didn't know what to make of it when I saw the trailers.  Actually hilarious.  How many stars would you give it?  Out of how many?  Out of 100.  97.  Wow.  Yeah, that's right.  97 stars. 
[00:48:00]  Wow.  Is he going to leave here with a juicer?  No.  What?  Price is right rules.  All of our guests do.  But Ron, we have to let you get to your show.  Let me get to my show.  I just want to say thanks to Mr. and Mrs. Roberts.  I'm glad that you guys are listening for this hour.  And see you back in here tomorrow.  Same time.  Stay tuned.  Ron and Fez is coming up next.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the O&A show on Facebook at facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.  And catch Opie and Anthony live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern. 
[00:48:30]  Ron and Fez are next.  Hey.  On the virus. </pre>
