<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about the hosts' childhood experiences with illegal fireworks, recounting anecdotes involving M80s, cherry bombs, and ash cans, sometimes used while under the influence of mescaline.  They described building homemade explosives and shared a video showcasing an M80's destructive power on a mailbox. The conversation touched upon the criminal underworld involved in the fireworks trade and the efforts of figures like Rudy Giuliani to combat it, referencing John Gotti's notorious Fourth of July celebrations. This segued into a discussion about a song featuring "Uncle Paul," followed by the loss of a former colleague, Steve, at a radio station, and a personal conflict causing one host significant stress and a two-day headache.  The discussion then shifted to Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes' divorce, focusing on Scientology's alleged influence.  They detailed Scientology's tactics to discredit critics, referencing documentaries and the experiences of a targeted BBC journalist, along with the appeal of Scientology's "leveling up" system, and their difficulty finding balanced perspectives from non-celebrity adherents.  A Dianetics commercial was also mentioned.

The show continued with further discussion of Scientology, specifically leaked videos of Tom Cruise and David Miscavige, described as strangely serious and "evil," "bond villain-esque" interactions.  The hosts analyzed Miscavige's speeches and discussed Scientology's alleged manipulative practices, including hidden cameras during audits and potential blackmail.  They speculated on Scientology's control over celebrities and the potential consequences of releasing damaging audit recordings, noting the changing power dynamic due to increased internet access.  Mimi Rogers' influence on Cruise joining Scientology was briefly mentioned.  The conversation then transitioned to the upcoming Anderson Silva vs. Chael Sonnen UFC fight, with humorous speculation and a caller, Jesse, mentioning the book "Kingdom of the Cult."  The hosts discussed their upcoming trip to Las Vegas for the UFC Expo with studio guest Bobby Kelly, sharing humorous anecdotes about fighting and past altercations.

The show then focused on an MMA Underground fight video depicting a white man beating a black man, with graphic detail provided, including the white man pouring his own blood into the black man's mouth.  A subsequent attack on the white man by another black man was also described.  The hosts speculated on the motivations of those involved.  This transitioned to a discussion of their experiences on social media, specifically Twitter, including follower counts, plugging their work, and the impact of controversial posts. One host mentioned a run-in with Justin Bieber.  The conversation shifted to *Westworld*, a giveaway of cardboard guns, the value of movie memorabilia, and a humorous discussion about *Pawn Stars*' Rick appraising the *Westworld* gun.  This led to a discussion of the WWF, its storylines, characters (Goldust, The Shockmaster, Mr. Ass), and evolution from a purportedly real sport to staged entertainment, with extended clips and commentary on the Shockmaster's infamous entrance.

The final segment heavily featured professional wrestling, with clips and discussions of humorous and embarrassing moments from WCW and WWF, including the Shockmaster's debut, Booker T's accidental racial slur, Goldust's striptease, and Roddy Piper hitting Superfly Jimmy Snuka with a coconut.  Racist and offensive commentary from 80s wrestling broadcasts was also discussed.  The conversation then returned to the upcoming UFC event in Vegas, with plans including a transvestite bar and a comedy club.  A significant portion was dedicated to Joe Rogan receiving his black belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.  The show concluded with discussions about Bobby Kelly's podcast, other Opie and Anthony-associated podcasts, and a lengthy, sexually charged, and racially charged conversation about the hosts' preferences in women, including explicit comments about specific racial groups, with frequent use of offensive language and crude humor.  Sam was also mentioned as a guest present in the studio for this segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning. Welcome aboard.  Put enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.  Yes. Good morning, everybody. Good morning.  Oh, my volume up. Well, that was nice. Like that.  Hi! It is the day  before the 4th of July, which would make, uh, what, the 3rd?  3rd? If I'm right, correct? Yeah. Before the 4th? 
[00:00:30]  So it's like Friday for everyone. Pretty much.  Everyone gets off tomorrow, I think. Yes, Chipper?  I ain't gonna say. Oh. Wow. That's a first.  I'm just reading the fucking paper. Oh, right.  I guess he does. It's the fucking free holiday show.  The fucking free holiday show. Yes, it is.  Chipper thinks he's cool.  I miss the 4th of July's of old. 
[00:01:00]  Oh, no.  Seems like there aren't as many, uh,  illegal fireworks out there.  I remember as a kid, you just heard it.  It was constant.  From, like, the first day of summer  up until, uh, August.  Do you drive with your windows in the city?  Are you, like, are you afraid to, like, let your windows be rolled down  because you're afraid some, like, black kids are gonna throw  firecrackers into your window?  Black kids.  That's what I was always scared of growing up.  Is that, like, the black kids in the neighborhood would throw firecrackers in my window?  Never happened. 
[00:01:30]  Of course not.  That's hilarious.  I never had that fear, but I'll try to work it up in my, in my fear repertoire.  You put it on your, your fear-lazy, Susan.  My fear Rolodex.  Frrt, frrt.  Yeah, uh, no, I never, never afraid of that, but  it used to be just, like,  you drive down your streets and  there was that huge pile of papers from, uh,  mats and mats of firecrackers  that were set off the night before.  Just, you don't see it anymore. 
[00:02:00]  Little bottle rockets at night, you just hear,  Now it's just gone.  You used to get those menus.  Like, like, there was always some fucking thug  that was handing out those sheets of paper  and you just circle it like Chinese food.  Yeah, I'll have some M80s.  I'll grab some of these and give me five mats of fucking firecrackers, black jacks.  I want some black jack firecrackers, M80s, and, uh, ash cans.  What's the difference between ash can and M80? 
[00:02:30]  I think M80s were stronger, but  ash cans looked like M80s, but they were silver.  Like an ash can.  And there were cherry bombs.  Weren't you worried about blowing your, I get,  the message got through to me when I was a young boy.  Did it?  Dude, I was so scared to blow my fingers off.  I never held an M80.  No, oh, but there's no greater thrill  and no greater danger  than holding an M80 and lighting it and throwing it.  Uh, you could place on ground life-fused getaway, like a pussy.  Uh, you know, like the instructions tell you to on the fireworks. 
[00:03:00]  But, uh, nothing like a lob in it.  Let me tell you, uh, you might have heard of a gentleman  named Joey Cumia.  My dad.  Jesus Christ.  Uh, I remember being...  How old was I?  Probably seven years old.  And, uh, Pops, uh, probably had a few, uh,  with his friends hanging out on the 4th of July.  And he had a paper bag full of M80s  and thought it was a good idea to teach, uh, 
[00:03:30]  teach the kids how to throw the M80s.  I was seven.  And what he would do is,  he'd give me the M80,  he'd tell me to, you know,  get my arm back there in throwing position,  and he'd say,  don't look at it.  Just when I say throw, you throw.  So I'd stand there,  petrified!  Petrified!  With my arm back,  my head looking skyward,  one arm forward,  and, and he'd take his cigarette out. 
[00:04:00]  I wasn't crying there, Zippy.  Thank you.  Shut up.  Jesus Christ, you faggot.  And, uh,  and he would light it.  And go, and go, and go.  Throw!  And I would just throw,  as hard as I could.  And boom!  The fucking thing would explode.  My tender little seven-year-old hand.  You know what that M80 would have,  it would have taken up to the elbow.  You'd be scared?  Would have been gone.  I'd have been,  maybe here today,  explaining why I had no arm,  and have to, uh, 
[00:04:30]  relay the same story,  but, uh,  having gone tragically wrong.  But you,  you were scared when that would happen?  Petrified.  Nervous, shaking,  like,  ah!  I liked the explosion.  I liked watching,  you know,  Dad light it.  He would light it with his Tarryton cigarette,  and then look at the fuse burning down.  Like, watch it,  and then get rid of it in the air,  and it would blow up in midair.  I thought that was pretty goddamn cool.  But, uh,  he would have me throw it,  and it would bounce on the ground a few times,  because I wasn't gonna hold onto it.  And he wouldn't be there,  light it, 
[00:05:00]  and then wait to say throw.  He had some responsibility, I guess.  That would be funny if he had me light it.  If he lit it,  and I just heard,  psst,  and I didn't hear him say throw.  Eeeh!  Eeeh!  I just start crying.  And then, uh,  holding Roman candles,  also.  Foo!  Foo!  Foo!  You held them?  Yeah, those things are dangerous.  I've seen them explode.  Ripping the cardboard tube completely apart.  Uh, 
[00:05:30]  Roman candles.  They're supposed to be pretty safe,  you know?  But, um,  wow,  very dangerous.  Fireworks are fucking dangerous.  Dude, I'm just,  I guess I was a pussy.  I never,  I,  I,  I,  I remember,  yeah,  of course.  Um,  but I,  I remember lighting them,  uh,  bottle rockets and aiming them at the highway,  at traffic.  Oh,  God damn.  Because we were on mescaline.  I did it when we were on mescaline.  Who were you with?  I,  I,  I think my friend Bill D'Angelo.  I got old Bill D'Angelo.  But I,  I don't think we,  uh, 
[00:06:00]  I,  I always get,  fireworks always fucking frighten me.  Where was Stanley?  Oh,  I don't think I hung out with him at that point.  I think,  I think I,  I think that's after I stopped hanging out with Stanley and Mike.  Hey,  Stanley,  go back.  Let's throw some hot oil on him.  He wanted to drain engine oil into a pan and throw it on a guy's chest.  Hilarious.  Who's hitchhiking.  Uh,  it's hilariously medieval.  But I was always scared,  man.  Yeah,  it was petrifying.  You were one of those guys,  though,  that would just,  would have fun with him on fucking 4th of July. 
[00:06:30]  I love,  I liked blowing things up.  I,  I wasn't a big fan of throwing them.  Cause,  uh,  that was kind of scary.  But I was a big fan of blowing shit up.  Shoving them 80s in things and then watching them explode.  Garbage pails,  mailboxes was a,  a huge one.  I love blowing up people's mailboxes.  Oh,  you shoved that M8 in,  flipped the door closed and just run.  That's a man act.  That's a man act.  Knocking down mailboxes,  driving through people's backyards.  M8 versus mailbox. 
[00:07:00]  Fucking rips it apart.  Oh,  here's a little video.  And,  uh,  wow.  Fucking piece of mailbox came chasing after him.  Wow.  Yeah,  they come apart.  See mailboxes come apart like that.  That really does fucking blow up a mailbox.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was always fun.  And,  uh,  and then,  uh,  a friend of mine,  uh,  Dave,  he would come over the house.  He worked at,  um,  at Struthers.  They used to make pipe fittings and stuff.  That came apart nice. 
[00:07:30]  And,  and he,  uh,  he came home,  uh,  one 4th of July with,  uh,  this pipe,  uh,  with two caps.  One cap had a hole in it and a Teflon tape wrapped around the metal.  Um,  because you,  you didn't want to go bare metal to bare metal threads while you're screwing the cap on with,  um,  gunpowder in there.  Cause it could friction.  Wait,  how would,  Oh,  it's so dangerous.  How would that work?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's a,  there's a threaded ends,  uh,  there's a pipe with two threaded ends and you have to screw a cap on one end and then you 
[00:08:00]  screw the top with a little hole in it on the other end.  After you fill the thing completely with hollowed out M eighties,  we would sit with a bag full M eighties,  just poke a hole in the side with a screwdriver and fill the pipe up with these M 80 fucking gunpowder.  And then you would make love,  sweet,  sweet love to Sarah Connor.  Exactly.  Stop Skynet from taking the world over.  Yeah.  But it's true.  We'd wrap the threads with Teflon tape,  which you use for,  um,  to make a good seal on it usually. 
[00:08:30]  Uh,  but in this case it was to keep the friction from getting the metal hot and sparking and  blowing your fucking,  uh,  friends up.  Yeah,  there you go.  That's the scene.  Could that happen as you were,  uh,  as you were putting the metal cap on?  It's happened so many times to people.  Really?  You can't even count it.  Wait,  and then when they're,  when they're threading something,  the fucking thing just blows up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It just fucking explodes.  Oh my fucking God.  And a giant explosion of shrapnel,  gunpowder, 
[00:09:00]  fire,  and death.  How about if you close it really slow?  Uh,  well,  you know,  even something slow under pressure,  uh,  like threads screwing tightly can still make enough friction.  The speed doesn't really matter.  That's a common misconception that can be deadly.  You must lubricate the threads and,  uh,  or use Teflon tape around it.  But wouldn't the tape make the threads not grip?  No.  Teflon tape,  uh,  can contours to the,  uh,  size of the,  the threads. 
[00:09:30]  Oh,  wow.  It really gets in there good.  And it's very smooth and,  uh,  and,  uh,  it puts a nice little seal on everything.  And you knew that at that age?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm 43.  And if you told me to do that right now,  I'd blow my arms off.  So we would do that and then stick a fuse in the hole after everything was lit up with a little bit of clay in there to keep it,  uh,  keep it from spilling out.  And then you do a cigarette fuse,  which was,  uh,  you'd smoke a cigarette a little bit. 
[00:10:00]  You break the filter off,  shove it,  shove it on top of the fuse,  and it would give you a good,  you know,  five,  10 minutes before the ash burnt down enough to light the fuse.  And then the fuse would light and kaboom-o.  And we'd put it on these giant,  uh,  like six by six posts that were in the ground to hold up big fences.  And it would just blow the whole post apart.  Like a railroad tie size fucking post.  And just in the air,  fucking sections of fence are tumbling and flying through the air. 
[00:10:30]  Looks great.  How many M80s would you drain?  It was probably a good,  let me think now.  With that,  ah,  it could have been 30 M80s.  It's just insane amount of fucking explosive power.  What does an M80 look like?  I don't think I ever held it.  M80's like a,  it looks like a card,  a piece of cardboard tubing.  Almost,  yeah,  like a miniature,  uh,  cartoon stick of dynamite,  almost.  Yeah,  yeah.  Like a red paper housing. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like that.  That's it.  Oh,  okay.  Yeah,  I've seen them.  The M80.  Oh,  yeah,  yeah,  I have.  Now,  does it look like a cherry bomb or is that shaped like a cherry?  Cherry bombs are round.  Oh,  they are,  okay.  And they're,  they were made out of some kind of fucking,  uh,  what was that kind of made out of?  Some kind of plastery clay kind of material,  the cherry bomb.  Oh,  they weren't the same thing?  No.  And then the ash can was,  uh,  silver and looked kind of like an M80.  And the M80s were strongest of those three.  Yeah,  that's,  uh,  what I,  uh,  used to know. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah,  the,  the cherry bomb.  Those are cherry bombs.  What was a step up from an M80?  Uh,  quarter stick.  Oh,  right.  That's a quarter stick of dynamite?  Yeah.  Yeah,  there were quarter sticks.  Would people have that?  Oh,  yeah.  Yeah,  people fucking Fourth of July,  man.  Especially in white trash Long Island,  where I grew up.  Man,  were there a lot of people with fireworks.  The,  the,  your town thugs,  the guys that would,  um,  break into cars and steal stereos,  and all those kids that started fires in the woods,  and,  uh,  they were the ones that always had the fireworks on Fourth of July. 
[00:12:00]  And,  uh,  they were the fun people to be around.  Yeah.  Where would they get them?  I don't know.  I guess some type of,  um,  you know,  there was always tiers of organized crime that would have it.  I guess the,  the mob would bring in the bulk of the fireworks and then dole them out to,  you know,  the next guy down the ladder,  and he would dole them out to the next guy.  So by the time it got to the neighborhood thugs,  it was,  you know,  a few,  a few degrees of separation from the actual source. 
[00:12:30]  But I think a lot of organized crime was bringing in,  uh,  fireworks into neighborhoods.  And when they cracked down on all that shit years ago,  uh,  especially Giuliani,  he had a big part in that.  Did he,  did he stop John Gotti's party one year or no?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He was the one that pretty much stopped,  uh,  Gotti from having his giant 4th of July party.  Every year,  Gotti would have a big one,  the whole block party,  right?  The whole block would love him.  They'd fucking set off their own fireworks display.  One year they had a short shot that went off and just lit the whole fucking neighborhood up on the ground. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  A few of those,  uh,  mortars that were supposed to go up in the air didn't.  So they're just flying around.  I think a few people were injured,  but,  uh,  nothing that serious.  Oh,  really?  Yeah.  Oh,  was that a quarter stick or?  Yeah,  I think that's a quarter.  Quarter stick.  Quarter stick of dynamite.  Why would you do it in a melon?  Like,  look how festive it's decorated.  Yeah.  It's a quarter stick of dynamite and it's got little swirls on it like a candy cane.  He's blowing it up on a tiny little bridge.  On a little fucking bridge.  But it's M80.  It's an M80 that he, 
[00:13:30]  I mean,  that's,  it's a,  it's a melon.  Oh,  that thing smokes too.  Yeah.  The fuse is really,  uh,  he's got a melon.  It's going to be nothing left.  No,  but he's just blowing a melon apart.  Oh wow.  That fucking blew up.  But an M80 would have done the same thing to it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a fucking melon.  That's a big bang though.  There's nothing funnier than watching somebody run away from a lit fuse.  It really is something.  There's something,  uh,  very instinctual.  When you see a lit fuse, 
[00:14:00]  you fucking run away.  Like two guys,  we're watching two guys light something and they put a bucket on it and they're running  away.  This thing will launch.  What is that that they're doing?  They probably put an M80 underneath.  Oh,  there's two guys in the line.  Wow.  It just came apart.  Didn't even launch.  You take a metal garbage pail and turn it upside down over a quarter stick of dynamite and  that fucker will launch like a rocket.  People just like watching stuff blow up.  It really is our,  our ape side. 
[00:14:30]  I wonder what that is.  It's the noise.  Boom.  Yeah.  It's just the,  it's the sound or the colors.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We do like that.  It's cool just to make a loud boom or big noise.  There is something.  Even like,  uh,  even the,  the festive airburst fireworks from like the Macy's,  uh,  the fireworks display and stuff like that.  We love just looking up and looking at that.  It's weird.  It's like this human thing.  We just like it.  You know what it is?  Cause we know too much now.  Like we didn't know years ago that a fucking, 
[00:15:00]  uh,  a star coming into the atmosphere was natural.  So we thought it was God-like.  Ooh.  We're just jaded from all that stuff.  So we kind of had to invent something to make it impress us.  Yeah.  God-like.  Yeah.  Wow.  It's that one,  Dan.  Uh,  I'm just trying to find some good explosions.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's a lot of that shit.  And we'll hear,  after the 4th of July,  the,  uh,  horror stories and nightmares.  Usually they,  um,  entail blowing fingers off from M80s and stuff. 
[00:15:30]  But the worst thing is when that mortar doesn't go off out of a tube.  You get like a nice eight inch fucking mortar shell in a pipe and,  uh,  they throw it in,  light that fuse and nothing happens.  And someone shoves their face over the fucking,  uh,  mortar tube.  And it goes off.  And it goes off instantly.  It just rips your head off.  That happens to people.  Yes.  Astounding.  People lose their arms and stuff every year,  right?  Or their hands.  Yeah.  And it's just something that happens.  There's somebody right now who has a hand who will not have it tomorrow. 
[00:16:00]  Your hand will be gone tomorrow.  In 36 hours.  How frightening is that?  Yeesh.  I've seen a video of that once.  I forget where it was.  On one of my sites.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was a guy with like an M80.  Oh,  it was a whole thing.  It showed it balling up.  His arm was just,  his hand was just ripped.  Oh,  we used to throw them at people too.  Thick puppies that have M80 parties.  No,  they probably didn't.  We'd light them up and just fucking play Ringolario catch.  Ringolario. 
[00:16:30]  What's that?  What is the Ringolario?  It's catch.  I've heard of Ringolivio.  Oh,  that's probably it.  There's a video on,  in Terror Bang.  Yeah.  I don't like watching that shit.  I don't want to watch that.  Someone's hand?  And a fireworks one.  The anticipation is too much to watch.  Wait,  what's the one,  someone's hand comes off on Terror Bang?  Yeah,  yeah,  I guess somebody lights an M80.  Oh.  And,  yeah.  I was always scared of that shit.  What is that thing that we were looking at?  It's like,  it looks like it's just constant fire being shot up in the air. 
[00:17:00]  Oh,  wow.  Someone taped 91 Roman candles together.  It looks like anti-aircraft artillery.  That's like what,  in the night sky over Iraq during the Gulf War.  But how are they going off simultaneously?  Like,  like one after the other.  How do they do that?  Well,  I'm sure the lighting,  I mean,  you got to get a lot of them going all at once.  Oh,  yeah.  Wow,  that's pretty good.  I don't know anything.  That's pretty cool.  People used to have Roman candle fights.  Yeah.  You just hold the tube and go,  foonk,  foonk,  foonk,  shooting them at each other. 
[00:17:30]  Can't you get hurt?  Yes.  Bottle rocket fights also.  Bottle rockets are less than Roman candles,  though.  Yeah,  but they'll take an eye out pretty fucking soundly,  I would imagine.  You know?  Especially when you break them off,  and then you have a fun nickname for them.  Oh,  right.  Yeah,  yeah.  Oh,  boy.  Boy,  the black people sure never got cut a break,  even when naming wacky fireworks.  Something chaser.  Yes.  I can't remember.  Oh,  I know that one.  Just,  and they're just going wild down the street. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah,  or when you're in school,  and your friends decide to put them off in the,  like the staircase.  Yeah,  yeah.  Where's that little enclosed staircase area?  Down the hallway.  And there was always the kid that you knew you could give the fireworks to,  if you had them,  but didn't have the balls to light them off.  You ever play with those little pop snap things,  that they look like those sperms,  and you throw them on the ground?  Yeah.  It's always fun when one lands right inside of your ear,  and goes off.  They used to do that?  Yeah,  it happened to me when I was a kid,  sure.  Oh,  man.  Went right into my,  right into the ear canal,  and popped.  I heard ringing for probably three days. 
[00:18:30]  Oh,  and then the sawdust from inside,  it gets all in your head.  That shit was itchy.  Shit makes you itch.  And people still buy those today.  That's like one of those dangerous toy things,  that no one,  like no one's,  no one's said,  hey,  you can't play with that yet.  Yeah,  it's kind of nice.  Seems dangerous.  Those and those two balls,  that you could kind of smash together,  with the gunpowder on it,  it would just kind of spark,  and make a bang.  Yeah,  they had like cap material on them.  Yeah,  I don't know,  I don't know how the parents decide what's safe,  and what's unsafe,  because there's no way that that's like a, 
[00:19:00]  a safe toy for a child.  It doesn't seem very safe.  No.  You can still get bomb bags.  Bomb bags?  Which is a little foil bag,  that you would squeeze,  and then throw,  and then the bag blows up.  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah,  it's like got like water in it.  Yeah.  And then it's a chemical,  that you could hit,  and yeah,  I remember those.  It's like a car bomb,  or something.  When I was a kid,  we used to go like to the Kmart parking lot.  Yeah.  One time I took a whole pack of firecrackers,  I just lit it,  and threw it into the parking lot.  Yeah,  you probably didn't. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah,  I think he's been getting it up.  You probably didn't.  Yeah,  I did,  we just threw it,  we just threw it,  we threw it in the parking lot.  The parking lot.  Do you think that's a lame 4th of July?  Terrible.  Terrible.  Yeah,  those things are stupid.  Yeah.  They're just little water packs  that you squeeze,  and I guess it reacts  with whatever chemical is in there.  It's probably just baking soda,  right?  Yeah,  it's just pressure,  it's not an explosive thing,  it's like the pressure going off.  Those stink bombs,  like the school stink bombs.  Stank bombs.  Those were so terrible.  Stank bombs. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  They never really stank,  it was just like,  oh,  it smells like sulfur.  A lot of smoke,  it smelled like sulfur.  Yeah.  There was a good line  in Injustice for All of Pacino  where he was saying,  remember the big thing  they had on him  in Injustice for All  was that he had turned  in one of his own clients  and that was what judge,  was blackmailing him?  Yeah.  And he said that he was telling me  these sick fantasies he had  about what would happen  if he put a cherry bomb  in somebody's mouth.  Oh, God.  And he said that one of his clients  was putting cherry bombs  in people's mouths.  People's mouths?  Just to watch it go off.  How terrible. 
[00:20:30]  Oh.  Would that kill you?  It probably would, yeah.  Cherry bomb?  Fucking head off, yeah.  But an M80 would definitely kill you.  Oh, yeah.  Hells yeah.  Oh, my God.  I've got to take another dump.  You're going to shit again?  Well, yeah.  When's the last time you shit?  I don't know why I'm saying that.  Well, like last night, though.  It's funny.  Not here.  But you said another dump  and I'm acting like  you've been shitting all morning.  No, no.  I know.  I'm squirming in my seat.  We don't have to go  a whole hour  before we take a break.  Take a break right now.  Why don't you go take your shit?  I'll take my dumpies  and I'll jerk off thinking about it. 
[00:21:00]  Be right back.  All right.  He won't be in a day, Joe.  What's SiriusXM?  Who's that old guy over there?  Uncle Paul, Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy stare.  Uncle Paul,  now he's coming over here.  Slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now  because here comes Uncle Paul.  Let me show you how to make  a big boy love you.  In today's episode,  Uncle Paul remembers 
[00:21:30]  presidential candidate  Rick Santorum.  I like Rick Santorum.  Sure.  He looks like a lot of my friends.  Where's the sweaters?  And he's got the Anson,  the Anson Williams hairdo.  I would file trade  with a guy that looked like  Rick Santorum.  He would always go,  I don't like the gays.  I'd go, me neither.  But it don't count  when they're really young  and you're just trying  to teach them.  We would teach them  how to kiss.  You gotta sit them down  and you put them  on your lap. 
[00:22:00]  You go, now here's  what you do with the lady  and you take the shirt off  and you rub the back  a little  and then you just  plant one on the neck  and you whisper something.  Close your eyes.  Close your eyes.  Open your mouth.  If you kiss too hard,  sometimes I'd get crazy  and we would lay on the beach  like I was Montgomery Cliff.  Yeah, whatever it's called.  From over there  to eternity or something.  I'd pretend there was  seaweed on us.  And I'd kiss real hard  and they'd go,  oh, you whiskers. 
[00:22:30]  I'd go, why are you talking?  And they'd say,  you're kissing my butt.  You just teach them  how to kiss.  And you gotta keep telling them,  close your eyes.  You look frightened.  You gotta make them  close the eyes.  People like that better  in the pictures.  Paul, you gotta ask them  and they look frightened.  Damn kids messing up  the pictures.  A lot of parents said,  what happened to his face,  Mr. Hargis?  He fell.  He skinned it on the rug.  Who's that old guy  over there? 
[00:23:00]  Uncle Paul.  Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy stare.  Uncle Paul.  Now he's coming over here.  Slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now  because here comes  Uncle Paul.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Ooh.  Oh, that's a bit boisterous  for this hour of the morning. 
[00:23:30]  I don't know if people want  to awaken to this type of music.  Oh, I don't think they do either.  You wake up with, what,  a bunch of heavy metal people  standing on your bed  strumming away.  Well, it's just crazy.  Perhaps some Engelbert  Humperdinck at this hour.  I like to wake up slowly,  a little something  with the volume slowly raised.  Slowly coming up,  something nice and melodic.  Not this noise  that the kids listen to.  This will make you  jump out of bed  and fall all over your slippers  and hurt yourself.  I don't like it one bit. 
[00:24:00]  And I can tell you  that you're not the only one.  We could both do  this entire break like this  and I would enjoy it.  Totally, totally, totally.  Hi, everyone.  Good morning.  That goddamn Uncle Paul song.  I tell you.  Isn't it nice?  Yeah, that was a good piece  of production.  That dumb song.  Yes, thank you.  Yes.  Yeah.  Any progress reports  on Steve's?  Where did he go? 
[00:24:30]  It's not.  Huh?  No?  What's he doing?  He was doing a...  Because I just...  Honestly, I don't know.  Yeah.  I just started  this wife's workout again.  MJ had written me  a good workout program  and I stopped it,  of course,  for a long time  because I'm a lump.  What did it say?  Do the opposite  of what Steve does.  What's he doing?  He was a production  and rock jock  on some rock station  in the middle of Pennsylvania. 
[00:25:00]  Like Wilkes-Barre  or something, right?  Yeah, somewhere like that.  Wow.  And he was doing mid-days  and then he got moved  to night's...  Wait, was he on the air?  He was.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Oh, look at that.  It's on a little website.  And, uh...  But he has since  lost his position  with the station.  Was it him  or was it the, uh...  I don't know.  Eric, the station  didn't flip, did it?  No, but they laid off  a bunch of people.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, they just  completely, like, you know...  That sucks. 
[00:25:30]  They probably have one guy  voice track and everything now?  They went automated.  We know how that goes.  It's not a fun thing.  So it's not impersonal.  It's just...  No, it wasn't him.  It's one less salary to pay,  one less insurance benefits.  Exactly.  That's a rough gig, man.  I mean, anybody...  The one thing about being  funny, so they say,  is at least you can  always work.  Yeah, there's a commodity  you have that can't  really be replaced by...  You can't voice track.  Yeah, a computer.  Yeah.  Computer.  Although our show  probably could be  voice tracked.  Yeah.  Just one guy  who hates himself 
[00:26:00]  and one guy  who does this  and one...  Psychopath.  Yeah.  Just play old  Klan fucking tape.  Mulata.  Mongrel class of people.  That must be Anthony.  What?  Do you know,  I was so angry  the other night  when I was on my way  to your place  because we just  weren't kissing yet.  Yes.  And when the fucking  thing wasn't working,  I was screaming  in the car by myself.  My head still hurts  for two days.  Oh my God. 
[00:26:30]  I made myself sick.  Yes.  I was supposed to shoot  with DeRosa yesterday.  You did.  And I feel so terrible  because two nights,  like, no,  the night before last,  I felt so...  I was walking like an old...  You know when you're sick,  you have like a flu,  it's old man walk.  You do the shuffle.  Yeah.  Dude, I couldn't...  I went to the cellar  because I had to do a spot  and I felt like  if I feel this way tomorrow,  I'm not going to be able to shoot.  You're the consummate professional.  How the fuck  you go to the cellar  into a spot after being that angry,  feeling that sick? 
[00:27:00]  I don't know.  It's not even professional,  it's desperation.  Oh.  It's desperation.  But I did a short set,  I told Artie,  I can't do a full set of two,  I don't feel well.  But I think I made myself  physically ill.  I can't yell like that.  It's fucking bad for you.  It's so bad.  That stress is fucking bad.  It's just bad.  And you know in the end,  it will be okay.  No, you don't.  You don't.  No, you really don't know  in the end.  But you just feel like,  of course,  I'm a loser.  Things get messy.  You know,  it brings up all the other...  It's always something else 
[00:27:30]  that it brings up.  Yeah.  Like about,  you know,  very rarely are we that mad  about whatever it is  in the moment.  It's always fucking...  Yep.  All this other shit  that comes pouring...  It's like you crack the door  and everything comes  fucking falling out  of the closet.  You're getting hit  with residual stuff  from 1975.  But it was just...  Oh my God.  I literally,  if I coughed out,  the whole back of my head...  It still hurts.  The whole back of my head hurts.  Wow.  Were you screaming  at your manager?  Not at him, though.  No, I wasn't mad at him. 
[00:28:00]  I was just mad  that it happened.  Like it was like...  But he's the one  who had to...  Yeah, but I was telling him  like, John,  I'm not, you know...  Again, I said this yesterday,  but I let him know  that it's not him.  Yeah.  But that's still unpleasant.  I owe him an apology  that he had to listen  to this shit  on a Saturday night.  That's their job.  I guess so.  That's their fucking job.  You know what?  Fuck him.  You're right.  They have to hear stuff  that you can't say  to other people.  Yeah, yeah.  Like I've said stuff  to Bob Eaton  that I couldn't call  the fucking management  here and say.  No, that's what  they're there for.  Motherfucker!  Because you can't... 
[00:28:30]  Because once you say  stuff like that  to your boss,  you're fired.  Yeah, yeah.  You can't unsay shit  to a network executive  or to a casting director  or whatever.  You can't unsay that stuff.  And it's very hard  to say it to friends  and family  because they kind of  don't get it.  You know,  what's going on really.  So they're there  to yell at it.  How do you think  they're earning  their fucking percentage?  Yeah.  You know,  getting the gigs?  No.  It's getting yelled at.  They're the buffer.  You're right.  Yeah.  Fuck, you're right.  Plenty of buffers.  Plenty of buffers, yeah.  Plenty of buffers. 
[00:29:00]  That's true  because if you call  your family,  they don't get...  No, they don't really know.  They don't understand  why you're so mad.  I thought it was all  fun and games,  the business you're in.  Yeah.  What's that?  Like fun?  Just screaming about it  and fucking cursing.  Yeah.  The online feed's not working.  My mother would be like,  oh, but you know,  can't you just go  and do the show again?  My, you're not getting it.  Come here, I'll feed you.  No, you don't get it.  You're not getting it, mom.  Oh, Chip.  Mom, Chip. 
[00:29:30]  So I have a fucking headache  for like two days, man.  It's very bad.  I think I did some...  I did some real damage.  Yeah.  It probably blew up  some fucking brain cells.  Jesus.  That's scary.  Oh, man.  I need some fucking serenity.  Yeah, serenity now.  I don't know if it's worth it.  It was.  It's not worth being that mad about it.  No, no, it's not.  It's not.  You gotta keep a little more calm.  Everybody should try that.  You know, I used to go  completely batshit in the car  when things weren't going my way  as far as driving goes. 
[00:30:00]  I still, believe me,  I'm not a happy camper  when things happen on the road  that could be avoided.  But for the most part,  I'm not yelling,  hitting the steering wheel  and the dashboard  and screaming to myself  in the car.  You gotta just take it  as it comes.  Where you gonna go?  That's my logic.  Where you gonna go?  Can that type of a rage explosion  really be a...  Oh, my God.  It's so bad.  It is bad for you, right?  When pressure goes through the roof.  That's what it is, man.  It's fucking... 
[00:30:30]  And from here, Kenny, it's fine.  It's from...  Let's just talk to me, Kenny.  It's code.  Because he was rubbing my leg  and I was pointing my cock.  I said, right here, Kenny.  He finally got the message.  Fuck, that's scary, man.  Yeah, you don't want to do that.  Two days.  Fucking headache.  The front page  of a lot of the papers today  is this Tom Cruise  and Katie Holmes episode  because they're busted up. 
[00:31:00]  She's not wearing a ring anymore.  Who do tell?  They got a big picture of her  on the front page  and they have her finger circled  with a red circle  where the ring used to be.  Oh, I thought that was the ring.  No, it's not the ring.  She had a bigger one.  That would be a dumb ring.  Yeah, the big red circle  around her hand.  And now she's supposedly  walking around  with a security team  to combat  these Scientology  thugs  that have  allegedly been  following her around.  And the post  has a very funny picture. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  It's Tom Cruise's face.  This one is not even  a drawing.  It's a painting.  Yeah.  It's like  with little funny  alien horns  in a giant  glass spaceship.  In like a Jetson's car.  Yeah, a Jetson's car.  Yeah, he's in the Jetson's car.  So he's in a little spaceship  because that's the Scientology people.  And Katie was afraid  that they were going to  take their daughter.  Scientology people  were going to kidnap  her daughter  and send her 
[00:32:00]  to that Sea Org thing.  Well, I said yesterday  on this very program  that I was going to go home  and do a little studying  on this whole Scientology thing.  And boy, did I ever.  You did.  I went to  what they call  what do the kids call it?  The YouTube.  Went to the YouTube.  And went to the Apple TV  so I could watch it  on my television.  And looked at a couple  of these documentaries  on Scientology.  And I gotta say 
[00:32:30]  what I concluded  what a bunch of kooks!  Fucking nuts!  And very intimidating.  Scary.  And from what I could see  dangerous people.  Really?  And I'm not afraid  to say it.  I'm petrified.  No, I'm not afraid  to say it.  There was a gentleman  who worked for the BBC  and he did two documentaries.  One a few years back.  One a little more recently.  And the one he did  a few years back  shows him 
[00:33:00]  trying to interview people  and just do a documentary  on Scientology.  And he's constantly  being tailed  by Scientology thugs  who are videotaping him  getting in the way  of him interviewing people.  He's interviewing them  and all they're doing  is using these  mindfuck tactics.  Calling him a bigot.  Not letting him  finish his sentences.  And this is all stuff  that he later found out  was used as a strategy.  They do this to people  that try to 
[00:33:30]  make Scientology look bad  when they're doing  these interviews with him.  And when you ask them  certain questions  that they deem subversive,  they will just talk over you  and call you things like  bigot, racist, hateful,  don't understand.  They'll completely deny  these allegations  that you come up with  instead of answering them  even though they've been  proven true.  And then the more recent one,  one of the thugs  that were following him around  turned on the church 
[00:34:00]  of Scientology.  And the guy  interviewed him.  And this was one of the guys  that was tailing him  and arguing with him.  And he literally  left the church,  turned,  and went to him  for another interview.  Why did he turn to the church?  Did it have anything to do  with the guy doing  the interview or no?  No, he wound up,  he was in it  since he was a kid.  And he had to be  in his mid-50s now  at this point.  And he was the head  of like communications.  He was the Goebbels  of fucking this whole thing.  The minister of propaganda. 
[00:34:30]  And he turned  because he didn't like  the direction  the church was going.  He still believes  in Scientology  as a religion,  but he doesn't like  what the church is doing.  He sees it as a money  and power grab.  It has nothing to do  with actual religion  or feeling good  about yourself  and helping others  and what I guess  this guy interprets  the religion as being.  So he's a real Scientologist.  He's not a Hollywood guy.  He's just a guy  who this is what he believes.  He was just a guy.  This is what he believes.  And wow,  he was saying, 
[00:35:00]  oh yes,  we were absolutely  following you.  It was on the order  from the highest sources,  you know,  the people in charge.  And they do these things.  They drill  with these tactics  to make you look bad  when you're doing  these documentaries.  documentaries.  They have a list  that they follow  on how to get  these subversives  off your back  and to discredit them 
[00:35:30]  so that their documentary  looks like there could be  an element of doubt  in what they're saying.  And that's all you need,  really.  But what they don't realize,  and maybe it's just  this day and age,  maybe it was different  20 years ago  when there was just videotape  and there was no YouTube.  Yeah.  You can go and see  50 of them  doing the same thing.  Yeah.  Or whatever that thing  might be.  And like Ope said  when he was at fucking  Occupy,  they would do the same thing.  You're a sex predator.  Right.  That's their tactic.  And it's like,  oh, fuck yourself. 
[00:36:00]  Yes.  Predator, predator.  Fuck you.  Pervert.  And they chant pervert,  pervert.  Because it shames you publicly.  Right.  And that,  shaming you publicly.  That's exactly what happens.  And this English guy  from the BBC  who was,  he wound up losing his mind  and looked like  a stark raving lunatic  in there.  Why?  They kept pounding him  about being a bigot  and being bigoted.  And I guess that,  they found out  which buttons to push.  And he unloaded  and exploded 
[00:36:30]  in this fucking  temper tantrum  yelling at this guy.  And he later  was showing  how embarrassed he was  that he let them  get to him like that.  Did the other guy  videotape him yelling?  Oh, yeah.  They all videotape it.  So what they'll do  the same as  what the media does  I guess.  Right.  Is take that fucking clip.  This is the guy.  And it goes out  all over the place.  It's like,  oh really?  This lunatic is,  he can't even  handle himself emotionally  and he's portraying us  in an inaccurate light?  No.  It was,  it was...  It's hard to keep your cool 
[00:37:00]  under those circumstances,  right?  Especially when that's  exactly what their job is.  Is to just keep  hounding you  until you crack.  But there were  a lot of people  that were just  fed up with the church  left and  were willing to talk.  And this is where  Scientology has to realize  if you're a real religion,  okay, fine.  But this is probably  what Catholicism  looked like.  I mean,  much less violent  when it was starting.  Like a bunch of people  like, you know,  what is this? 
[00:37:30]  I mean,  yeah,  I'm all for Christ  but what do you mean?  It's like,  I don't like where  this is going.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I just don't like this  church thing  that they're doing.  You know,  Jesus kind of walking around  preaching love  and everything.  That's fine.  But now,  why do I have to  cough up so much money  to you motherfuckers?  But this is how it starts.  This is what it looks like  when it starts.  Yeah.  And we can't have  like a guy,  a holy guy anymore  because it's,  you know,  we don't buy that stuff  as much.  Yeah.  So now it's  the magic.  We don't buy the magic anymore.  We don't buy the magic  like we used to.  Yeah. 
[00:38:00]  A lot of people  have lost their lives  too in these weird  circumstances  of suicides  and just people  dropping dead.  People that gave  so much of their money  to Scientology  that they were  left destitute  and kind of  once they were  through,  once the church  wrung out  their bank accounts,  they were just  kind of cast aside  and a lot of them  wound up committing  suicides.  It just seems though  like,  I don't think you  really blame the church  for that  because it seems like 
[00:38:30]  if you get caught up  in that kind of thing,  You're as dumb  as a Catholic  that does it  or a Jew  or an animal  It's almost like  this fanatical  cultish thing  that maybe  you're not mentally  stable in the first place  that you're looking  so hard for something  to satisfy the void  in your life  and that when  you might start  seeing that this  ain't really it,  it must give you  that feeling of despair  like there's nothing  and you end up  cashing in the old  chips.  And Katie Holmes  was on the inside  obviously. 
[00:39:00]  Katie the Wad Holmes.  As much as an  outsider can be.  Tom Cruise  is at the top  of that fucking  food chain.  Yes, yes, yes.  And maybe she is  worried about her baby.  Because I'm wondering  if you don't want  to be photographed  why are you  in New York City?  Then again,  I guess she's working  and she has to be here.  She wound up  staying in New York  as part of  her strategy  for the divorce.  Why do you think  that is?  So she's visible?  I think she  set up residence  in New York.  She wants to be able  to claim that she 
[00:39:30]  lives in New York  so that  because she believes  New York divorce  law will  be more  advantageous to her  as far as custody  and money goes.  More than California.  Yeah, California  usually.  They're very weird  when it comes to  custody battles  in California.  Like Cruise  may get custody.  Yeah, yeah.  So she,  well she just assumes  it'll be better off.  Doesn't have that  Tom Cruise  home field advantage  of Hollywood.  So, yeah,  that's part of  the strategy  I gather.  Oh. 
[00:40:00]  Um, also  she wants to  have her guards  around and I  think New York  isn't as  Scientology friendly  as, um,  yeah, as  New York.  Yeah, California  is crazy.  California and Florida  are two real  Scientology meccas.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yes.  And, uh, I guess  she doesn't want  to be hanging  around that.  It's so weird.  I was watching it  and it's just  all these, this, uh,  BBC guy interviewed  a lot of celebrities  too that are  Scientologists and  they just, I mean, 
[00:40:30]  he was asking  questions that were  really prying into  the religion, but  yeah, that's his  job.  But a religion,  how is it a secret?  This is what bothers  me about Scientology  is they have things  that are like secret  and it's like as a  religion, like how  could any of that  stuff be secret?  Maybe Catholicism  has secret stuff  too that I don't  know about.  Yeah, yeah.  But shouldn't that  shit all be open  touching?  Oh yeah.  That's their secret.  You know what?  Yeah, they, believe  me, they're the  masters of cover  up of the Catholic.  Yeah, yes. 
[00:41:00]  But Scientology,  just when you think  Scientology, when I  first, I, my first  thought is wackos.  Yeah.  And it's like, what  has happened that I  automatically think of  that?  Because there has to  be something good  about it.  Like everybody who  joins it isn't an  idiot.  It's not like it's a  mecca for a lot of  smart people.  that are Scientology.  So what is it about  it that's very  attractive?  Like how do you, with  all the bad press  they've gotten, and  they've got a lot of  bad press, what is it  about it that people,  you know what, forget  that bad press.  This is the, I like  this.  Seeing some interviews  with the regular 
[00:41:30]  Joes and not the  Hollywood people, they  were walking into the  Scientology building and  they were being  interviewed also.  It seems like they,  they were talking  about it and saying  it's helped me with  my life, it's helped  me organize myself and  helped me want to do  good for others.  And just giving you  kind of a purpose, I  guess.  I don't know, but  people seem pretty happy  with it.  When you take away the  lunacy of the space  people and the  thetans and all that 
[00:42:00]  shit, I guess it's a,  you know, as good as  any other religion.  That L. Ron Hubbard  commercial is, I'm  telling you, that's what  did it.  It was, do you  remember the  Dianetics commercial?  Dianetics.  And the book would  come flying out at you.  I'm fat and want to  lose weight.  Page 170.  It was almost like a  biblical commercial.  Yes.  With, where every  problem you could  possibly have.  Can we find an old  Dianetics commercial?  Yes.  It was a brilliant  commercial.  I remember that book  and I remember that  commercial and it's 
[00:42:30]  like, it was one of  those things where it  just looked like, wow,  there are answers here.  There are answers in  that book and they  made it seem like, yeah,  there's answers.  How can a person  suddenly lose  confidence?  Page 194.  Can your mind limit  your success?  Page 107.  How can you reach  your full potential?  Page 28 or whatever.  It's just one of  these, and then a  big volcanic explosion.  Dianetics by L. Ron  Hubbard is the  owner's manual for the 
[00:43:00]  human mind.  Get your copy today.  Wow.  Owner's manual for the  human mind.  Who wouldn't want  to, like, that seems  like something that's  kind of, wow, you  know, it didn't preach  God or anything.  Right.  It wasn't very  religious.  It just seemed like a  problem solver right  there, you know?  But then you start  getting into what  Dianetics and  Scientology is all  about, and it comes  off a little weird.  I think people get  caught up in it, too,  like you get caught  up in a video game  with levels, because  there's a lot of  leveling up in 
[00:43:30]  Scientology.  You start off very  low at this certain  level.  And then through  your auditing, they  call it, where you  hold on to those  metal contacts, and  they ask you  questions and see  what affects you  emotionally and  what pains you and  what's holding you  back.  And that's what you're  dealing with.  And then each time  you face that, it's  supposed to bring the  level down off of  this auditing machine,  and you wind up going 
[00:44:00]  up another level.  And I know in video  games, the whole  thing is about  leveling up.  You just, you know,  you don't go to bed,  you're like, I got  one more level, one  more level.  That's what it's  like.  It's like World of  Warcraft with the  fucking religion.  I'm going to leave  Scientology, but I just  want to get one more  level.  One more level.  I just got a level  one more.  Ma, I got to do  this now.  Do we have any  Scientologists that  listen?  Like, well, I don't  know if I've ever, I  mean, I've obviously  spoken to them in the  business, but I've  never talked to a 
[00:44:30]  Scientologist about  all you do is hear  speculation.  Yes.  And we see the  videos of the  fucking extremely  angry people  chanting.  But I mean, are  there any, I would  love to know a  normal guy that's a  Scientologist that  goes, nah, you know  what, those are the  fringe people.  Yeah.  This is what, it's  like Catholics who  would say, like, I  don't run around and  beat myself with  fucking olive branches.  Right.  I don't put wounds on  myself like they do or  draw stigmata on my  hands with red marker.  Yes, yes, yes.  I'm just a Christian.  I go to church and  I'm a good dude. 
[00:45:00]  But it seems like  that fringe for  Scientology is a  little more of the  norm than the  fringe, you know,  because again, because  like you said, we  don't really hear from  just the regular  Scientology people that  go and, you know,  experience whatever  they do.  And then when they  go home, it's not  their entire life  revolving around  Scientology.  I think that's the  Tom Cruise, Katie  Holmes problem is she  was fed up with that  lifestyle because he is  so all in with 
[00:45:30]  Scientology.  He I saw some  interviews with him.  He actually did this  interview thing for the  Church of Scientology  and the video got out  somehow.  It was supposed to just  be an internal video and  it's him just talking  about it.  And he he just looks  like a fucking  possessed weirdo.  Really?  Yeah.  He's talking about it  and, you know, it's  it's just weirdness.  Him helping people.  And the fact he was  saying things like,  you know, I'd like to  go on vacations and  have fun and do all 
[00:46:00]  those things.  He goes, but I  realize I can't because  there's so much work  that needs to be done.  It's like this  motherfucker has the  world by the balls.  Katie Holmes is  probably sitting there  going, can we go to  fucking, you know,  some island in the  Caribbean?  And he doesn't go  because he feels he's  got to do work and  help people.  And then he was  talking about how he  is dyslexic.  He Tom Cruise  dyslexic.  Yeah, when he was  doing like Top Gun  and whatnot, he  he wanted to get 
[00:46:30]  his pilot's license.  And he took a one  took one lesson and  gave it up because he  couldn't fucking read  and interpret what he  was reading as  quickly as need be to  to be a pilot.  And it was very  frustrating for him.  And then when he  found Scientology, he  he was able to fix  that without drugs,  without any kind of  psychology, which they  can't fucking stand in  Scientology.  They think psychiatrists  and psychologists are  the devil.  That is their devil. 
[00:47:00]  And and he fixed it  and said, I now have  my pilot's license and  everything's hunky  dory.  He didn't say how, but  he said that it was  directly because of the  teachings of L.  Ron.  I wouldn't fly with him.  Wait, so he wasn't a  Scientologist when he did  Top Gun?  No, apparently not.  No.  I guess that's in the  80s.  When did he come to  Scientology?  I can't, I can't see.  1990.  Oh, wow.  He got into Scientology.  But he was given this  speech up there in front  of these Scientologists  and at this ribbon 
[00:47:30]  cutting at another one of  their many buildings that  are in really good areas.  Do we have that speech?  I rent.  Yeah, where was it?  I think if you just put  Tom Cruise Scientology, a  lot of shit comes up.  And he sounds like a  fucking mental patient.  Well, he's, he's there.  Like, he is their go-to  guy.  He's a great, I'll say  this, maybe his wife  gets annoyed that he  didn't want to fucking  vacation, but this is  where, maybe he's one  of those guys, he's an  obsessive worker, but  this is why he's 50 and  he still looks 25 and 
[00:48:00]  he's doing action movies.  That's a different one,  yeah.  It's one where he's  kind of standing in  front of a crowd  outside.  I thought he was in  longer, though.  I didn't realize he  joined as a, I didn't  realize he was already a  star when he joined.  And then the head of  Scientology now that took  over after L. Ron  Hubbard, what's his  name?  Miskevich.  Yeah, yeah.  Miskevich.  Yeah.  He was the best man at  Tom Cruise's wedding.  He was the best man at  Katie Holmes and Tom  Cruise's wedding.  Tom Cruise is all in.  He walks up to him at  one of these events. 
[00:48:30]  It's a video.  He walks up to the  head muckety-muck and  salutes him.  And it isn't like a  smile and a salute.  They are both standing  face-to-face saluting  each other with the most  serious fucking look on  their face.  It's just, we, I  don't know.  Anyone who gets that  deep into a religion  or an ideology like  that, it just strikes me  as odd.  And, you know, we just  know him from movies. 
[00:49:00]  Look, we really don't  know Tom from a hole in  the fucking wall.  We know him from  movies.  So this is the equivalent  of him kind of, in adult  life, becoming an  evangelical Christian or  getting all in with  Christianity.  And you've seen that  happen to celebrities  before, where they just  find God.  Like a born again.  Yeah, I guess you've  seen that happen plenty  of times.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, there's another  one where he's sitting  there in a room.  Yeah, Scientology number  14.  Where he's sitting in 
[00:49:30]  that room.  I guess this is part of  it.  Yeah, what's this?  I think I've seen this.  Have you seen it?  Full 40 minute leaked  video?  Jesus.  Who's that?  Let's take it another.  Joseph Goebbels.  He's the head  muckety-muck.  Is that Miscavich?  I think it is.  I see him, Danny.  Miscavich.  Can you turn this  louder?  The influence of the  corporate executive could  be greater than the  housewife, which in turn  could be greater than the  street sweeper.  They just go off.  That may not seem fair, 
[00:50:00]  but neither is life.  And it has zero to do  with what others might  say.  Literally.  It rests on one's own  shoulders.  Allegations.  And it's the individual  himself who must know  he's doing his part.  Doesn't it just look  weird at the big pompous  podium and the big seal  behind him with the globe  in it?  It just looks like a movie  where this guy is evil.  Yeah.  It doesn't...  That view, what we're  looking at there, a guy in  a suit.  He's got the giant globe,  the Scientology symbol 
[00:50:30]  around him, a big podium  with a microphone.  It looks like...  You don't look at that  and go, well, he seems  like a nice guy.  You look at that scene  and think evil, trying  to take over the world.  Exactly.  Because he's the only  people that delivers  speeches in front of a  globe, like a big globe  background, like a bond  villain.  Right.  He's a bond villain.  Yeah, you just coughed  and food shot onto the  monitor.  Food got on the monitor.  Oh, yeah, there it is.  It's just lettuce, Jimmy.  Oh, okay.  It's just shredded lettuce.  Let us get it off there.  I get it?  I didn't get that. 
[00:51:00]  All right, Chip.  But yeah, he's...  Maybe that was misguish.  I don't think I've ever  seen him talk before.  It just kind of looks evil.  I think this is the Tom  Cruise...  Oh, no.  There's a lot of...  Yeah, that's the Tom  Cruise part where he's...  That's the interview,  right?  ...sitting there.  Yeah, it's just Tom  talking.  That's not a Scientology  thing, is it?  No, it looks like an  entertainment show.  No, this is Scientology.  That's the Scientology  seal down there.  Oh, no.  And they're just playing  Mission Impossible music  down the whole time.  For the first time,  effectively change 
[00:51:30]  people's lives.  And I am dedicated  to that.  I'm gonna...  I'm absolutely  uncompromisingly  dedicated to that.  The orgs are there  to help, okay?  But we as, you know,  as also the public,  it's like, we have  a responsibility.  It's not just the orgs.  It's not just Dave  Miscavige.  You know, it's not just  me.  It's you.  It's everyone out there  kind of rereading KSW 
[00:52:00]  and looking at what  needs to be done and  saying, okay, am I  gonna do it or am I  not gonna do it?  Period.  And am I gonna look  at that guy or am I  too afraid because I  have my own out ethics  to put in someone else's  ethics?  And that's all it  comes down to.  He must just do this  all the time.  You know, because I  put it ruthlessly,  you know, myself.  And I think that, uh,  I respect that  in others. 
[00:52:30]  And, uh, you know,  I'm there to help.  And we're here to help.  And my opinion is  like a savior complex.  You're on board  or you're not on board.  Okay?  Welcome aboard.  If you're on board,  you're on board just  like the...  Welcome aboard.  We are the authorities  on getting people  off drugs.  We are the authorities  on the mind.  We are the authorities...  People are just saying  there's a real...  We are the authorities.  I would love to know  what happened to him.  Yes.  It might not have even  been something bad.  Maybe his life was so 
[00:53:00]  good and he felt like  he wasn't giving back.  He, yeah.  Well, he did talk  about that.  He talks about how  he did, um, uh,  color money and Top Gun  and he had, he had  succeeded.  He had reached the point  he wanted to reach  professionally, but it  just wasn't doing it.  Right.  It wasn't...  He still didn't feel  fulfilled.  There was something  missing.  And, uh, he says that  the Scientology kind of  gave him that, the  missing part. 
[00:53:30]  But it seems like the  Scientology thing has  really taken over.  Him and his personal  life, like, yeah, okay,  I can watch him as, you  know, on Mission  Impossible and other  movies and it's great.  It's Tom Cruise, the  action guy.  It's Tom Cruise reading  other people's words and  being a whole different  person.  But this is Tom Cruise.  And something tells me  this is Tom Cruise 24  hours a fucking day.  Yeah.  And it's gotta get old  real fucking fast.  Him just yapping about  Scientology. 
[00:54:00]  It probably gets a  little exhausting.  Oh.  Just that personality  would be difficult.  Just to be surrounded.  He's a very...  So intense with it.  He's so serious and  intense about it.  Yeah.  Maybe that's what makes  him a great actor,  though.  I mean, honestly, like,  he might be one of  those guys that whenever  he locks on something,  he's just fucking...  He's just that guy.  Yeah.  That's it.  He's used to being...  I didn't realize he  went in as a huge  celebrity, though.  Yeah, he had already  been a pretty big  celebrity at that point.  I really thought he  was much younger when  he joined. 
[00:54:30]  I didn't...  He just wanted a box  licked or something.  Jesus Christ.  What the fuck?  Who got him involved?  Was it...  Ooh.  Wouldn't have been  Miskovich, or was it...  Well, I wonder.  It was his first wife.  His first wife?  Mimi Rogers or whatever.  Mimi Rogers?  Mimi Rogers?  I gotta check on that.  Jeez.  Boy, they must fucking  love Mimi.  That's Scientology.  They apparently love  celebrities.  They treat them like  the upper echelon  in Scientology.  And one of them,  it was a guy that was  in G.I. Jane, 
[00:55:00]  some guy was in G.I. Jane,  and he was a Scientologist,  an actor.  And he left.  And boy,  persona non grata.  They don't like him.  But he left for the  same reasons.  He didn't like what was  going on with the church  itself.  So it just became  some kind of a money  and power grab.  It's all about money.  And they will squeeze  every drop out of these  people.  The amount of money.  And there's allegations  of blackmail, too, 
[00:55:30]  that when they're doing  these audits on people,  they videotape it.  And they made an excuse  as to why they have  hidden micro cameras  in picture frames  and smoke detectors.  so it's not as  intrusive when you're  being audited to look  at the cameras  that would be in your  face, would be  intimidating, and you  wouldn't be as open to  it.  So they hide the cameras.  But everyone knows  that you're being  recorded, is what they  say.  Allegations are they 
[00:56:00]  don't know they're  being recorded.  And what they do is  these pains, these  painful moments when  you're being audited  show up on the meter  on these machines.  and they have to  get out of you  your emotions, what  you feel, what hurts  you, what you think  is in the way of  success and feeling  happy.  It could be something  sexually, could be  some kind of deviancy,  could be something  that happened in your  past.  And when you spout  all this out, and  they have it on  videotape, if you 
[00:56:30]  want to leave their  organization, they  approach you.  There have been  allegations of this,  too.  People being  approached with  folders.  pictures and  video saying, hey,  you know, we have  all this stuff.  You sure you want  to leave?  And they would, you  know, the mindset  here is that they  would release it to  the press, and if  you're a high-profile  celebrity, you've  spilt your guts to  these people.  They know things that  you don't want getting 
[00:57:00]  out there, and now  you're stuck in the  organization.  The only thing that  they probably couldn't  do, because it would  ruin them, is if you  think, if they have  Travolta or Tom  Cruise or any of  these big celebrities  saying things that are  career-ending in a  confessional, Scientology  would ruin that  person, but by  releasing that video  would ruin themselves.  They would be  ruining, like,  bringing down Tom  Cruise by, to see a 
[00:57:30]  guy like that in a  private room holding  onto these things, and  when people saw what  it was, nobody would  ever join Scientology  again.  You don't think  they have, with  everything they've  done, you don't  think they have some  kind of contingency  plan to actually  release this stuff  without their hands  getting dirty?  Oh, maybe, yeah.  In some way, shape, or  form?  I don't know, but  like you said,  obviously they'd be in  an auditing room, so  the video would have  had to have come from  the Church of  Scientology, but they  can maybe say it was 
[00:58:00]  smuggled out by  somebody that was  trying to besmirch  the Church, and  you know, you  throw a sacrificial  lamb out there, but  the bottom line is the  information's getting  out on the person that  they wanted the  information out on.  I'm sure, watching  their shenanigans on  these documentaries last  night, I'm sure they  have it all thought  out.  They're very organized  as far as how to  make people look very  bad.  But this is all, you  know, these are the  allegations that have  gone on.  Years ago, no one  would have talked 
[00:58:30]  about this.  I think their power  base is not as strong  as it used to be.  Their intimidation  doesn't go as far, and  I think that has to  do with this openness  in media now, and  social media, and  people having access  to a lot more  information, that it  makes it a lot more  difficult for them, for  anybody to really hold  on to power these days  when there's so much  information out there.  It used to be, people  didn't even really know  what these thetans were  and the space fucking  story until you reached  a certain level, because  they deemed this 
[00:59:00]  information that could  be detrimental if you  hadn't gone through  the levels, to know  this immediately, right  when you go into  Scientology, you could  literally go crazy and  die.  That was their whole  take on it.  So they wouldn't tell  you about the space  man angle of  Scientology until you  had been through a few  levels already.  But now with the  internet and stuff, it's  very easy to get that  information, so you  just read up on it and  you know all the  levels.  So they tell people  that go into  Scientology, do not read  anything online about  Scientology, because it's 
[00:59:30]  going to affect how you  deal with the church  and you'll be setting  yourself back a few  levels that you've  already advanced if you  look at that stuff.  So whenever you see a  story on Scientology, don't  watch.  And there's also a weird  thing like, I've heard of  people who have seen the  space angle and they went,  what?  Yeah, yeah.  I heard, where did I hear  that Tom Cruise was shocked  when he heard it?  Yes, and I'm not sure if  that's their line, if they  are supposed to do that.  Like, I think they're  supposed, they're told, 
[01:00:00]  look, this is what the  deal is, they're a spaceman  and they did this and that  that, but when someone  asks you, make it look like  you don't even know what  the fuck they're talking  about.  I think that's what the  church, it seems there's a  lot of deception going on  is all I know.  I don't know why or to what  end or how detrimental it  is to the people that are in  it, but it does seem a lot  of deceptions going on in  that church.  You know, and it's like,  you're right, you can't,  powerful people, it's  internet, Twitter, any way 
[01:00:30]  to tell people, X amount  of people, something  quickly, YouTube, Facebook,  it fucking helped bring  Mubarak out of Egypt.  It's brought down  empires.  It's balancing things,  like if Catholicism, if  the Archdiocese of Boston  can be closed or take a  billion dollar hit, no  fucking body is saved.  If the Catholics can get  hit, anybody can get hit.  It's the biggest weapon to  any kind of oppression or 
[01:01:00]  tyranny, totalitarianism,  in for fucking  mation.  It brings down empires.  The whole job of a power  base is keeping people  stupid and in the dark  about what's going on  outside of your little  fucking kingdom.  And when that information  starts oozing in, look  what happened with the  Soviet Union, even before  the internet.  Information started getting  in, they told their  people what the Western  world was about.  Decadence, horrible  homelessness, and they 
[01:01:30]  painted a picture of what  the West was like, and it  wasn't accurate.  And once that information  got into the Soviet  Union, Soviet Union, it  crumbled, because the  people started going,  wait, not only is it  pretty good out there, but  they've been fucking lying  to me the whole time.  And that pretty much is  what brought the wall  down.  Tear down this wall.  Yeah, so information  really does do that, and  I think with Scientology,  that's kind of what  happened. 
[01:02:00]  So, of late, I don't  think they're as powerful  at knocking down critics  as they used to be.  I mean, how far down the  line do you go?  Everybody that just, you  know, is tweeting  something bad about  Scientology?  Dude, the front page of  the Post is mocking, it  has a picture of Tom  Cruise with Spaceman  fucking antennas on his  head in the Jets  space man antennas.  I mean, nothing we say  is going to be as  visually powerful.  Yeah, yeah.  And the papers are  talking about it  constantly.  I mean, they're not 
[01:02:30]  scared.  Yep.  They don't give a fuck,  man.  Yeah.  Post the Daily News,  it's like, what are you  going to go after all  of these?  What is Scientology going  to do to Rupert Murdoch?  Yeah, Rupert Murdoch  said, you know, he  thinks it's cultish and  dangerous.  You know, no one, no  one, especially somebody  in the public eye like  that, used to say bad  things about Scientology  because it wasn't worth  the hassle you'd get from  their lawyers and thugs  and whatever else.  South Park.  Oh, man.  Yeah, yeah.  Because South Park brutalized  those guys.  Totally. 
[01:03:00]  And survived.  Yep.  And they're still going  strong and, you know.  Somebody's just write,  in Soviet Russia, car drives  you.  All the Yakov's lines  are like that.  In Soviet Russia, you  arrest police.  Wait, what?  That doesn't make sense.  What?  Yes, with magnetic dinner  trays and genuine linen  napkins.  Right, we got it.  Really terrible selling  points.  It was the worst.  I still can't get over  that.  And any time Russians are 
[01:03:30]  mentioned in any context,  I can't not talk about  those magnetic dinner  trays.  How much would you love  to go to that show?  I want to so bad.  We should do that.  We should have a fucking,  we should go to Yakov's.  Let's go to Yakov's  dinner adventure and see  those magnetic trays and  see the authentic,  genuine linen napkins.  In Branson, Missouri.  Branson, Missouri.  He runs that town.  He's amazing.  He does, right?  Yeah.  He runs it.  Yeah, road show. 
[01:04:00]  Let's go.  Branson.  I don't know if we draw  down there, though.  I don't know.  If we would have an  audience.  Probably not.  Phones are not lit today.  They were before.  Brady brunch.  Oh, well, this one guy  that, uh, there is a book  called Kingdom of the  Cult.  I might as well maybe  finish up this wonderful  Scientology segment with,  uh, Jesse.  Bill T.  Orlando.  Hi.  Hi.  Hello.  How are you,  gentlemen?  Oh, dandy.  Hi, Jess.  Well, I'll cut to the 
[01:04:30]  chase.  Um, there's a book  called The Kingdom of  the Cult, and the  premise is that if you  believe that a God  exists, then he must be  perfect.  Therefore, anything written  about that religion has to  be historically true, or  cannot be scientifically  unproven.  And it goes through every  religion, from Scientology to  Mormonism to Jehovah  Witnesses, and it shows the  proof of plagiarism to, I  think of Mormon, said there  was, uh, steel swords and  metals before steel was even 
[01:05:00]  invented.  It's phenomenal for all  religions to show how  they're all pretty much  lunacy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, they are really.  Well, plus the people that  are writing, even that, the  people that are writing the  books, it's in their vested  interest for you to believe  every word of it, because  that kind of keeps them in the  position they're in.  Right.  Yep.  Yes, sir.  Exactly.  Anything else?  So,  I like taking a call, because  it ends the bit.  Yeah.  It ends the segment. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  It ends the discussion.  Thank you, sir.  Yeah, goodbye.  Uh, we'll take a break, eat  our, eat our grub.  And each other.  And, uh, yeah, lick our  dicks.  Imagine if that's what we  did during a break, if we  all just ate each of those  asses in the studio, how  awful break would be.  Oh, God.  Ah, wonderful.  If, oh, get it.  And, uh, we'll be right  back.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  This is the OPN Anthony  Show. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, please.  Little fucking.  You don't even know any of  the fighters.  Look who's here.  I know the fighters.  It's like, uh, Pee-wee's  Playhouse.  Put my mic on, stupid.  It's on, stupid.  Oh, sorry.  Turn your headphones up,  stupid.  Bobby Kelly.  We're talking about Vegas.  We're talking about Sam.  I guarantee you, what's your  finishing move, Chael?  Ugh.  Ew.  It's a big fight.  I know this fight.  You guys, uh, you guys are  heading to, uh, what, Vegas?  Oh, yeah.  We're going Thursday.  I wish we were leaving 
[01:06:30]  earlier, but we have a  3.30 flight, which is  fine.  We'll get in at 6.30, make  love, have dinner.  Yeah, sure.  I can't wait.  And the expo's there, which  is fucking...  Yeah.  We're going to interview  people and fighters for...  That's going to go well.  We're doing a bit for, uh...  We're getting audio for the  show.  Can I just tell you  something?  A big difference between  Comic-Con and fucking, uh,  UFC Expo, when the guys  have been trying to cut  weight for the last week  and they want to rip  somebody's fucking head  off, and the guy goes,  excuse me, uh, what's  that?  And he fucking just 
[01:07:00]  punches you in the face.  And not, ain't no better.  I'll ask, I'll ask a  question.  No, you probably won't.  You ever tap so many  times that you need  tap shoes or something?  They're going to go  like this.  What'd you say?  What?  I'm in the fucking mood  for you.  And grab you by the neck  and squeeze you like a  stress doll.  Forest.  Forest.  What, are you getting a  bunch of trees around  you or something?  Ah, good one.  I fucking hate it.  That's a good one.  Chael sunning.  How come you're not  chael mooning?  Oof.  I'll make, I'll have  everybody laughing.  Anderson Silva. 
[01:07:30]  How come you're not  Anderson Gold?  I saw that one coming  a mile away.  Come on, Chip.  Bullshit you didn't  fucking know.  I did, Chip.  I love Angry Chip.  Angry Chip.  I don't like Angry Chip.  Really?  I like, um, regular kind  of nice Chip.  I love Angry Chip.  Angry Chip gets me  uncomfortable.  He makes me, like  electrifies me for some  reason.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Shocking.  Double gun.  Double gun.  So, uh, yeah, it's  going to be the worst  plane ride ever.  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to stay up  all night.  You're stuck in, uh, 
[01:08:00]  horrible first class  with, uh, Chippa.  Yeah.  And, uh, how are you  going to deal with first  class and, uh, Chip  there, uh, Sam?  How, how are you going  to, uh, deal with that?  Well, lucky me.  I won't have to deal  with any of that.  Oh, you won't.  Any of that pesky  first class stuff.  Oh.  Ever in your life.  So, uh, you're going  to be in coach.  Yes, I'll be back in  economy.  That's, yeah.  That's how I travel.  You ever fly first  class?  No.  Wow.  How old are you?  28.  Can I just say 
[01:08:30]  something, though?  As thin as he is,  everywhere's first class.  That's true.  Nice big seats.  Yeah.  Leg room.  Yeah.  Reclines all the way  back.  Yeah.  That's right.  Yeah, we'll go back  and say hello.  No, you won't.  No one ever does.  I'll send you my cookie  because I can't eat it.  No, you won't really  send me.  Swear to God, I'll send  it back to you.  I hope so.  We'll call it, we'll do  that, uh, the ookie  cookie game that the gay  guys do.  What is that?  I know the game.  You never heard of that?  I heard of Acker Cracker.  He'll.  Jerking off on it.  Right. 
[01:09:00]  You get a jerk off in the  first, you get a jerk off  on the, jerk off on the,  jerk off on the cookie  and the last one to jerk  off on it has to eat it.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Easy for you to say.  Not really.  I get nervous.  Has to eat it or gets  to eat it.  Yum.  I've told people in  coach that I was going  to come back and say,  you know, say hi or  fucking bring something  back.  I never leave first  class.  Why would I do that?  We were going to  Vegas one, one, I  mean, California for the  poker tournament and it  was a good, and XM  flew us all first class. 
[01:09:30]  XM took really good care  of us back then.  Yeah.  And, uh, it was a  continental 757 and  there was, it was a big  seat first class.  Yeah.  Not like regular first  class.  They had really good  seats in this one.  And it was Steve's  birthday, our producer.  And he was, you  remember that?  He was in the coach.  Yes.  So I, I came back and  I, I, I didn't tell him  what I was doing and I  looked at where he was  sitting and I'm like,  I just made sure it was  an aisle and, um, I'm  like, Oh, motherfucker.  And, uh, I said, Steve, 
[01:10:00]  it's your birthday.  Do you want to take my  seat in first and I'll  sit here?  Yes.  Yes.  He fucking.  Okay, Ralph.  So he went up.  I immediately regretted it,  but I gave him that first  class seat and I sat in  coach.  Wow.  And Anthony brought me  back his Sunday.  Yes, I did.  You guys get Sundays?  Oh yeah.  That flight you did.  That was a California  flight.  More everything.  It's great. 
[01:10:30]  I get weekends.  You do.  Get it?  Oh yeah.  That's fucking hilarious.  Double sprinkles.  Holy shit.  He loved that one, Bobby.  Chippa loved that.  Fuck a weekdays, you  motherfucker.  It's going to have me  laughing my fucking  balls off. 
[01:11:00]  Fucking cocksucker.  Branson, Missouri.  It's your show.  There you are.  Explore Branson.  Boy, they're advertising  it on the, uh, on the  television there.  Branson.  I think we're going to  put the special on this  Saturday.  Yeah?  The Saturday of the show.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Yeah, I think it's going  to air like, uh, maybe  six on the channel.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Yeah.  On Saturday night.  To promote UFC's pay-per-view.  Yeah.  Pay-per-view.  I can't wait to see this  fucking, the whole card is 
[01:11:30]  great, but the fight, you  know.  I just read an article  yesterday that it wasn't  going to happen.  That they went to Brazil  and the fight wasn't going  to happen.  When they went to do the  press conference for this  fight, that he was going  there with Chael to make  the fight happen because  Anderson was like, fuck  you.  I'm not fighting this guy.  Wow.  Disrespectful.  He doesn't deserve a  fucking title shot and he  had to go in and scream  at Anderson, like have an  argument with fucking  Silva.  Is this the most, Dana  White?  Is this the most like  hatred you've ever seen 
[01:12:00]  between people in a UFC  fight?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, he said he, he  fucked, he fucked around  with, he said some shit  about Anderson's wife and  you know, Brazilian guys, I  mean, you can say some, you  know, you really don't want to  fucking go down that  road.  Yeah.  He has every Brazilian guy.  I mean, all of them  fucking Vandele, all the  guys.  Vandele Industries?  No, Vandele.  Oh.  A lot of the guys hate him  now.  I mean, just because of the  disrespect that he's showing  to his family in Brazil. 
[01:12:30]  And he said, he said, when I  was a little kid, we used to  be outside talking about,  you know, technology, playing  with gadgets and we'd see the  little Brazilian kids outside  playing in the mud.  It's like, Jesus.  I'm telling you, I really  think that he is in  Anderson's head and I think  Anderson is a little scared  of him.  Not because he's such a  better fighter, but because  he's already had, I don't  care what the reason was, he  had one really bad fight  against him and there's so  much at stake. 
[01:13:00]  Like, you want to beat this  guy so bad, but you know  that the guy who you want to  beat is fucking, is a  problem.  Chael Sonnen is a fucking  nightmare.  I don't, I think, I think  this fight's going to be over  real fast and, and someone's  going to be hurt and it's not  going to be Anderson.  I think he really fucking  made this guy angry.  I think the first fight he  might've gotten his head with  this shit, but I think this  one, he's like, I'm, I'm,  I'm fucking, cause even in  the last fight, the last  round, he was lifting his  hands up. 
[01:13:30]  He was getting beat, but he's  like, this is great.  Let's fucking go.  Somebody, somebody's finally  fighting me because  everybody, he just knocks  out in the first couple  rounds and, and, but he's  mad now.  And he said in the  interview and he never  does that, that he's  going to knock his  fucking, all of his  teeth out.  He played the audio.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fuck.  You don't break his  arms.  This is a guy who never  does that and never says  anything.  He's always quiet and  respectful.  Kind of that martial arts  guy, you know, you know,  fuck water, you know, you  must feel like water.  You become teapot. 
[01:14:00]  You become chip's face.  How come, how come those  martial arts guys like  that never like want to  fight?  They never fight.  It's always that last resort,  but then they wind up  kicking someone's ass.  They're all, they're all  trying to sweep the leg.  Of course.  Sweep the leg, Johnny.  Yeah.  There's only 1% of them  that fucking don't want to  fight.  And then, you know, if you  know how to fight, I would  think you'd want to fight if  you're really good at it.  Dude, I've been boxing for  three weeks, not even real  boxing.  I want to punch Keith in the 
[01:14:30]  face.  Do you want to fight?  Every time we put gloves  on.  I saw your, uh, your tweet  that you were on your way to  the, uh, the boxing gym.  How's that going?  Awesome.  Yeah.  Is it?  It's really good.  It's digging it.  It's the worst thing.  It's the worst workout I've  ever done.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This guy's this Haitian dude,  Steve.  Brutal.  I want to bite his little  two inch braided ponytail off  every time we, it's an hour  workout, right?  Hour workout, but it's, he  does this shit.  It's different every time.  Like you get, you like you  get the hang of it and then  he just has you doing some  stupid shit and you're  like, oh fuck, this just is 
[01:15:00]  terrible.  How much boxing do you do?  We do a lot.  I mean, you put the gloves  on, you wrap up, you put  them on and he's, now he's  doing this stuff where he  trained you for like three  weeks of how to, you know,  you're moving, you did this  fucking karate kid shit, the  wax on, wax on.  Oh no.  Were you doing this?  It's wax on, wax off.  Well, whatever.  Wax on, wax on.  Yeah.  You're all full of wax.  Yeah, Chip.  I fucking hate him.  This trip is going to be  difficult.  But, uh, and then he brought  us in this week and was like,  okay, put all this shit  together.  And you know, now you're 
[01:15:30]  ducking and weaving and.  Oh, so you can put the moves  together.  Yeah, but we can't because me  and Keith are too stupid.  So we can do it one at a time  as a workout.  But when you really want us to  box and we have to block, hit,  block, jab, right, hook, block,  duck, we're fucking.  It's like you're dancing now.  Is Keith a good boxer?  Keith, he's good, but we're  both stupid.  You know what I mean?  It takes us, you know, he,  he's like, all right, right  hand, you know, right, left,  duck, right.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Say that again?  You know, it takes like 30  minutes. 
[01:16:00]  If you guys just started  wailing on each other, who  do you think would win?  We've already done it.  Me, Colin, Keith, and Dove  Dave off.  Yeah, Colin can fight.  He can fight.  Well, he's not Irish.  Yeah, he's got, well, he  grew up in Brooklyn.  He can fucking scrap.  Yeah, wow.  We went to the gym one night  at 12 o'clock.  Noon?  No.  After the spots one night,  we went over to Astor  Place Crunch, and they have  a full-size gym.  I mean, a full-size ring,  and we went in just to go  over and box the bags and 
[01:16:30]  maybe fool around, but of  course, we're a bunch of,  you know, alpha douchebags,  and we went in without  headgear, and we had  gloves, and...  Just gloves.  We said, just body, which  lasted three seconds.  Of course.  I chipped up Dave  off the tooth.  What's that?  Oh, God.  No way, really?  Like...  But he's...  Jeff David, that's a tough  guy.  He can box, yeah.  Oh, yeah, he fucking...  He went...  He turned his head, he  went, Bobby, you chipped  my tooth.  What's that?  And then he went... 
[01:17:00]  And my head just went...  Oh, he fellated into  your head.  Fucking four.  Fucking...  Just right, left,  right, left.  I was like...  I hear Colin in the  stomach so hard.  He always heard was...  You're gonna kill the  guy.  Oh, it was the best.  He came in, he was  ducking down, doing that  fucking old school, you  know, Irish...  Oh, the fucking Marcus of  Queensbury rules.  He was just nailing me.  Gentleman Jim Corbett.  I...  Yeah, I hit him... 
[01:17:30]  Marquee of Queensbury,  whatever it is.  Oh, fuck you, people.  I hit him in the side, he  always hears...  And then Keith laughing.  Really?  Yeah.  Like a fucking tire running  with air leaking out of  it?  Is that what he sounded  like?  He's a...  He's not a kid.  You gotta watch where  you hit Colin.  Yeah, Colin still can  scrap, though.  He's still got some  fucking fighting him.  Yeah, it probably...  It's probably better to  hit someone in the face  at that age than in the  body.  Especially with a big  face like Colin has.  Yeah, big head, big 
[01:18:00]  Colin head.  Colin has a big head,  huge face.  Yeah, he does that  with a big Irish face.  Yeah.  Big Irish face.  What about Keith, though?  I thought it was a  bobblehead doll that  they made for him, but  it was just a regular  doll.  I'd be afraid to get in  the ring with Keith.  Really?  Yeah, it's like Philly,  fucking black guy.  No, I mean, him and  Voss went at it.  Remember the O&A thing?  Hmm.  Remember they fought in  the boxing ring?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, they had the  blindfolds on, and then  Voss threw a kick.  Yes, Voss threw a kick.  You remember that?  Yes, I am. 
[01:18:30]  Of course I know.  One of my favorite  moments in life.  Voss threw a kick at him.  Stupid Keith and Voss  got carried away in the  ring.  They had blindfolds on.  They were trying to  throw punches, and then  Keith really fucking  connected with dumb Voss.  Voss, the fucking  weasel he is, grabbed his  glove with the thumb and  picked up his blindfold,  one-eyed fucking Keith  from the back, and kicked  him in the fucking back  and fell.  He threw a karate kick,  but it wasn't like a full  extension kick.  Remember his knee? 
[01:19:00]  His leg didn't go, because  he doesn't stretch, he  had tight jeans on.  Oh, man, I forgot about  that.  And then Keith was on top  of him for 10 minutes  going, come on, my son.  Calm down, player.  Calm down, player.  Voss was really mad.  That's fucking good.  Yeah.  Voss was fucking, dude,  Voss is, I know he'd  sucker punch you, because  they were both fighting  with blindfolds, and you're  not supposed to look, and  he got hit.  He got tagged.  He was pissed.  And then he picked up  with that boxing glove.  You know how hard it is  to pull a blindfold up 
[01:19:30]  with boxing gloves on?  Yeah.  And he peaked, and saw  Keith's back and kicked  him.  Jews will always peak.  My mother would say  that.  Chipper, a Jew is always  going to peak at you.  Watch it.  Watch the peak in Jews,  Chipper.  Don't be a fucking  anti-semi, Chipper.  That's what my mother  would tell me.  Your mother was a  fucking whore.  What's your language?  A fight, a slapbox fight,  or any kind of fight where  you go not in the face  or anything, it just  lasts until the first  person connects.  Yeah.  Because then you've  got to escalate it.  You've got to do better 
[01:20:00]  than the guy did to you.  So if he just hits you  in the arm, you're going  to fucking pop him one  in the chest, and then  he's going to hit you  in the face.  It's just the natural  progression of, I don't  want to be fucking the  guy on the shitty end  of the stick.  And the feeling of  hitting somebody,  connecting with somebody  with a glove on, in  the face, is almost  like a drug.  I've never boxed.  It's almost a drug.  Is it really?  Yeah, especially when  you're not a boxer,  and you don't, and you  hit somebody, and you're  like, oh, yeah.  But the sad part of it 
[01:20:30]  is, and me and Patrice  talked about this once,  because we were talking  about if I fought, if I  fought Patrice, I was  like, I'll do this, I'll  do that, and I'll fucking  kick you in, and I'll  punch you in.  He goes, Bobby, what the  fuck do you think I'm going  to do while you're doing  all this shit?  Just bringing you right  back to earth.  He goes, I'm doing the  same shit, motherfucker.  I'm going to punch you  a fat head.  I'm going to bite your  nose.  When I was in California,  I was having a slap  boxing fight.  I was just hanging out 
[01:21:00]  in front of the thrifty  drug and discount store.  That's what I used to  do.  I didn't even have those  back out in there.  It was right next to the  Vons.  For some reason, I just  saw you doing this like  last week.  Oh, I know, right?  Yeah, that's what I did.  Just hung out there,  trying to grub up 15  cents for the triple  scoop of ice cream.  What the fuck year is  this, 1950?  And this guy, his name  was Gabriel Mares.  How do you remember  that?  Because I hated him  for years and years  and years.  He walked up and he 
[01:21:30]  used to call me  horse shit.  Why?  Because I would clean  out the corrals.  Hey, horse shit.  And him and the guys  would walk by the  stable when I was  cleaning out the  corrals.  They'd be like,  hey, horse shit.  Because I'm cleaning  horse shit out of the  corrals.  You don't think we're  not going to call you  that?  Oh, please.  Yeah.  Horse shit.  Hey, horse shit.  Hey, horse shit.  Yeah.  Like, motherfucker, man.  It's the opiate horse shit  show. 
[01:22:00]  It's got to be one of the  greatest fucking  nicknames ever.  That fucker got me, man.  And I was in front of  the store and Gabriel  Mares came with his  fucking people, his  little posse.  And he was like,  hey, horse shit.  Put them up.  Let's slap box, man.  Show me what you got.  And I never got any.  I never had anything.  I sucked at fighting.  So, hence the guns.  I said, eh, I win.  So, he started, like,  putting up his hands 
[01:22:30]  and open hands, you know,  and kind of throwing out  some jab slaps at me.  And all I could do was,  like, back up.  And I'm bent over, like,  backwards.  The worst thing you could  do.  Yeah.  And then, like,  I went to come forward.  Yeah.  He had a fucking right  hand fist waiting for me.  Wow.  Just balled up a fist  and cracked me one  right above the eyebrow.  Split my fucking brow open.  I'm bleeding like crazy.  I fucking put my,  I ended up on my ass.  I don't even remember  hitting the ground,  but I was sitting  on the sidewalk, 
[01:23:00]  covering my eye,  and I felt the blood  coming out from  between my fingers.  And I looked up  with one good eye  and hearing, like,  that ringing sound  to just him and his friends  looking at me and laughing.  It was one,  it was one of the most  degrading, like,  moments of my life.  He didn't worry  that you were bleeding?  Didn't give a shit.  He loved it.  He was laughing.  And then,  and then he just went,  like,  take it easy,  horse shit,  and walked away  with his friends laughing.  Did you ever get him back? 
[01:23:30]  No.  Yeah, you did.  Nope.  Yeah, you did.  You know what he's doing  right now?  Oh.  You know,  you're beating somebody up.  He's probably in prison.  You're in a pool  flying fucking stupid helicopters  over your neighbor's houses  while you're getting blowjobbed  by fucking 22-year-olds.  And I did make the age go up  just so you'd feel better  by 10 years.  10 years!  Hey, horse shit,  you doing good, kid?  Hey, horse shit.  That's a great nickname.  It really,  it sucked so bad 
[01:24:00]  that I couldn't fucking,  a good thing,  it never caught on  with anyone  but his little group.  There was probably  three people  in his little posse.  He was like fucking Butch  from the Little Rascals.  He used to walk around  with Woim  and the other guy.  Was he a redhead?  No, he was a Mexican.  Oh.  It was, you know,  Southern California,  so he was a Mexican.  He just had,  he had a great  straight head  of Mexican hair,  that big Mexican,  the hairline  that was right above  the eyebrows.  Yeah, their eyebrow hair  and their pubic hair connect.  Yeah, yeah.  They have to shave  underneath their armpits 
[01:24:30]  and the side  of their assholes.  Yeah, yeah,  it's just full of hair  and, um,  horse shit.  Called me horse shit  and punched me  in the fucking head.  Well, you've never  been punched, right?  Norton?  Yeah, I mean,  uh,  growing up, sure.  I mean,  not that many times, though.  You know how,  just being funny,  you get out of it.  You do try to,  it does,  it does save you a lot  being funny, but.  Yeah, no,  it saves you a lot.  Gabriel Mayers  didn't enjoy  my sense of humor.  I remember at Juvie Hall,  they were beating up  all the,  there was three white kids, 
[01:25:00]  me and two other kids,  and they were beating  us all up.  They beat up,  they threw,  we were playing basketball,  they threw all the  basketballs at one  of the kids' faces.  Oh, man.  And you just turn around,  his nose was shattered  and he's,  you can't really cry.  Oh.  He's got to kind of  take it.  And then they gave  a blanket party  to the other kid  and then they were  coming after me  and they all came  into the room one day  and sat down  and ghosted me.  They just come in the room  and pretend you're not there  and they're talking,  they sat on my bed  next to me  and I'm like, 
[01:25:30]  ah, fuck.  And then they,  they said something like,  you're a homeboy,  motherfuckers.  And they go,  well, you're a homeboy,  you're a white boy.  And they were talking  about white boy bitches  and homeboys.  And I went,  I'm a homeboy,  motherfucker.  And it was like a,  dude, fuck you.  It was a second of no,  like,  and then they went,  God, this motherfucker's funny.  You all right?  You all right, kid.  You all right.  And I was like,  oh, God,  that could have been  this motherfucker's funny  or a complete ass beating.  Ass beating or fucking  could have gone.  Both ways.  Yeah. 
[01:26:00]  Inside and out.  I only remember as a kid  being really mad  at my friend Chuck.  And I don't remember why,  but I didn't know how to fight,  but I remember chasing him  with a brick  and him running into the house  and he was screaming,  Mrs. Norton,  Mrs. Norton.  And then I think  he ran into his house  and I threw a brick  at the door.  That's all I remember.  Wow.  Yeah.  That's as close as you got.  Jesus.  He cut a cat up after that.  I was just like,  I remember another fight 
[01:26:30]  I got into,  and this is when  I was even younger.  I was probably maybe  seven or eight years old.  It was in Central Islip.  And this kid  was always fucking  smacking me  in the head  and shit like that.  And of course,  I come in crying  and my father was like,  You're the father?  Jesus Christ.  The fuck are you doing,  pussy?  Get out there.  Fight him.  I'm like,  Oh God.  So I,  You didn't want to get out there  and fight him?  No. 
[01:27:00]  I did not like fighting.  It hurt me  and made me cry.  I was a big crybaby  and my dad would get  very angry with me.  I was a crybaby too.  I used to fucking cry  and nobody came to help you.  Stop with your pissy eyes.  He called me pissy eyes.  Oh, horse shit?  Hey, pissy eyes.  Old horse shit  with the pissy eyes.  You had a lot of good nicknames.  I certainly did.  He's like,  Stop it.  I'll give you something.  Yeah.  Knock it off.  I'll give you something  to cry about.  That's great.  So what happened?  So I went over  the little railing 
[01:27:30]  on the balcony.  We were on the first floor  of a garden apartment,  a two-floor garden apartment.  There was a big grassy area  out back  and I went over the railing  and there was the kid  and we square off to fight  and he takes me down  in a second  and pins me down  and punched me in the face  and I just started crying.  Pissy eyes.  And my father's like,  All right, enough!  And the kid like stopped  and I had to get up  all fucking crying,  punched face. 
[01:28:00]  And my father going,  Get in here!  And he just didn't even  talk to me after that.  Did he try to show you  how to fight?  No.  He knew I was a lost  fucking cause.  He was annoyed?  He was so annoyed  that his faggot son  couldn't even throw a punch.  He just watched the picture  like fucking  a few years from now  he's just going to be  sucking cock.  Wow.  At least he was perceptive.  Yeah, he was  none too happy.  Didn't talk to me.  Didn't even fucking, 
[01:28:30]  you know,  say,  Ah, here's what you  gotta do in that situation.  He was just disgusted.  You know what's weird too  is that I have all that shit  and like guys  who get into fights  and you know,  it's usually the anger.  It's guys who don't know  how to fight  are just frightened.  You know,  every time I want to  beat somebody up  or something  I'm just fucking afraid.  The guys that are  real badasses  They're not afraid  to get hit.  Calm as shit.  Never want to fight.  I mean,  that's where that  martial arts shit comes from.  It's not really martial arts.  It's that you know  that you can fucking 
[01:29:00]  beat the fuck  out of somebody.  Yes.  And they're not afraid  to get hit.  I have this fear  of getting hit.  I don't like the idea  of a fist  hitting me in the face.  It seems like it hurts  and it does.  I've been hit in the face.  It hurts.  I don't like it.  Doesn't it hurt  when you wake up later?  Like when you get knocked out?  Oh God.  Yeah,  that's another thing.  I've just seen some fights  that escalate into  that stomping thing.  God,  when people stomp,  they knock someone down 
[01:29:30]  and then they're just  jumping up  and landing on their head  with boots.  That'd fucking kill you.  Yeah.  But when somebody gets  knocked out  and nobody catches them,  they just fucking fall  on cement on their face.  A lot of people  have died that way.  They just fucking fall  on the back of their head  after a punch.  It's like,  yeah,  I killed them with one punch.  It's like,  no,  not the punch.  It's fucking landing  on the back of your head  on concrete.  There's nothing worse  than after a fight  where you start,  and then a couple,  like 20 minutes after  you start feeling  where you got hit. 
[01:30:00]  Like right after you,  like,  you don't feel shit.  Goofy fat lip.  And then I'll be,  yeah.  And then it's all numb  your mouth  or busted nose  where you can't even  touch your nose  or it gives that,  that boom feeling.  Boom.  Are you going to be afraid  if you lost  of that kid fucking  with you all the time now?  You're going to have  to kill him.  But does that happen?  What?  Because like,  I don't think I ever  got hit again  by Gabriel Mayers.  I got beat up.  He continued calling me  horse shit,  but I don't think  he punched me again.  I got beat up. 
[01:30:30]  I got beat up  a couple times  with the same guy.  Yeah?  Yeah,  as a kid?  Yeah,  once they knew  they could fuck with you,  then they'd fuck  with you all the time.  I think I was so pathetic  they didn't fuck with me.  I think,  I think the kid  that beat me up  at Central Islip,  it was like,  why bother?  It's so easy  to fucking fuck  this kid up.  I used to hang,  I just started hanging out  with tougher guys.  Yeah?  Yeah,  just way tougher  fucking dudes.  Yeah,  it's your bodyguard.  Yeah.  I hung out with  tougher fucking kids  that would, 
[01:31:00]  that would,  uh.  What's this video,  Danny?  Some bully shit.  This is some bully shit.  Some fight.  Just knock out compilation.  Yeah,  but the guy threw a punch  at the guy  and it didn't even faze him.  He's been bitch slapping  this guy leaning  against the pole  and now the guy  came off  and now he's swinging.  I don't think he knows  how to fight very well.  Oh,  he went to kick him.  Oh,  he's kicking him.  Oh,  he punched him in the face.  Oh,  it's over,  Johnny.  That should be  the end of it right there.  Once you,  oh,  see,  he's stomping his head.  I hate the head stomp.  But look,  the guy's right back up. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah,  there's no reason for it.  Yeah,  because he's right back up.  He looks like  he's going to fall down again.  Where's that?  I'm happy I stayed here.  Yeah,  I'm fucking happy.  People,  people's mentality  around fights  is fucking barbaric.  They love seeing it.  It's gladiator type shit.  I mean,  who the fuck likes seeing that?  This guy's like,  this is the best shit ever.  I'm glad I stayed here.  People love watching a fight.  They do.  They love it.  It's this basic,  really weird chimp thing we have.  Yes.  Like,  even in high school,  I remember when there was going to be a fight. 
[01:32:00]  No one ever said,  well,  let's try to get these guys to talk.  Right,  right,  yeah.  We wonder why fucking countries bomb each other,  because on that level,  in school,  you couldn't even get two guys  that they're fucking throwing punches.  Yeah,  yeah.  There was something about combat  that you weren't involved in.  And if you notice,  most people in power,  they're not the ones fighting.  No.  They're just kind of setting it up.  And that's how it was in high school.  Like,  you would want to watch,  the guys who couldn't fight,  like me,  wanted to watch,  but then again,  the guys who could fight,  liked to watch it too.  And then go over and suck off the loser. 
[01:32:30]  I remember when I was in high school,  I was,  you know,  oh boy.  Holy shit.  That was Rampage.  That was Rampage?  We're watching this knockout compilation.  Holy shit!  What a cheap shot.  That was his power bomb.  Double knockout.  He used to pick guys up  and just slam them  and knock them out.  Knock them out by slamming them  on the back of their fucking,  like their shoulder blades.  Oh man.  That's Kimbo.  Yeah,  Kimbo Slice in the street.  I remember when I was a kid, 
[01:33:00]  when I was in high school,  I was probably a junior,  and that's when I was the white black kid  and I used to wear like the black hats.  I wish I knew you then.  I was very embarrassing.  But I was a senior,  I think.  I was looking for an identity.  You were a senior in high school  at that time?  I was drunk.  Really?  Yeah.  Did you have all like the rap albums?  Did you rehearse the rap songs  at your house,  like try to get them down?  I didn't rehearse them,  but I genuinely liked them.  But yeah,  I was like that guy  with the fat laces.  But did you stop the tape,  rewind it,  stop,  play it to get the,  you know,  to get the line?  What is he saying here?  I gotta get that. 
[01:33:30]  Oh,  yeah,  I used to have to do that  for learning songs,  vocals on songs.  It was pretty hard to do.  Yeah.  But to do it for rap songs  just so you know them,  so you could seem cool  to the black people in school.  But I remember I was,  I had my fucking like red can go on  and I was so afraid  of fucking not being without a hat.  I almost,  I had to go to,  they wanted to send me  to a rehab with a psych place  because I was so,  I hated my hair so much  that like being  without a hat  was a psychologic,  they actually let me  after a doctor's note  wear one.  Like I was so fucking  out of my mind  about taking my hat off. 
[01:34:00]  How did you not get a nickname?  Yeah.  Hey,  hat.  We'll just call him hat.  But I was just a weird dude  and a fucking,  that is strange.  This black guy,  Orlando,  who really could have  beat the shit out of me,  snatched my hat off  in the lunchroom.  Uh oh.  Which to me,  So you dropped the N-bomb  and fucking chased him?  No,  I wish I had a better story.  Yeah.  But to me,  someone snatching my hat  was this,  it was the ultimate  humiliation and exposure.  That's just fucking hilarious.  This is a little dumb 
[01:34:30]  Jimmy with a red keg  with my glasses on.  Thick glasses?  Yeah.  Powerless to do anything.  But I fucking,  I snatched it back  aggressively.  And uh,  he goes,  oh you want to fight?  And we started to walk outside  and I most certainly didn't.  But I said something,  I think I said something like,  hey if you wanted to see my hat  you should have just asked.  Ugh.  Oh,  beaver cleaver.  But it gave him the out. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  Like,  then we just kind of,  it dissipated,  but that was a really close one.  But I gave him,  because he would have killed me.  Yeah.  And I think he just didn't want  to get involved in beating  this white nerd up.  Yeah.  I gave him the out he needed,  because I'm like,  I don't want to get suspended or something.  I forget how I,  it was some,  I gave some pussy,  but I,  it gave him the out to go,  hey you got a lot of fets over there.  I forgot that I said that like,  uh,  like,  but I think he interpreted  my, 
[01:35:30]  the slight aggression,  which was really desperation I showed  in snatching the hat back.  Yeah.  Was enough to make him go like,  what am I going to do?  But he still,  he kicked the shit out of him.  This pathetic mess up.  They had this video on,  uh,  MMA Underground,  uh,  this,  this white kid in DC,  beat the fuck out of this black kid.  Uh,  he's just jiu jitsu guy.  Just unassuming white dude.  Oh wait,  in the hood.  And,  was that the guy on the sidewalk?  Uh,  yeah,  yeah.  And he was wearing kind of a striped shirt. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah,  yeah,  I just saw that.  I saw that one too.  And the black guys loved it.  Well,  because the white boy,  they're like,  look at white boy,  look at white boy,  kicking his ass.  I'll tell you the part that really flipped him out.  Cause the guy was a little like,  you know,  stop it,  stop it.  And then he punched him and he started bleeding on him.  And he started going,  you want my blood?  Yeah.  And he started pouring it in his face and mouth.  Yep.  And you saw him go,  I don't want,  I don't want whatever fucking Hep C.  This motherfucker.  Craig.  And then he got the guy and then he fucking,  uh,  he finally,  the guy,  the,  cause the guy could really fight. 
[01:36:30]  And the black guy just,  the black guy had a bunch of black guys around.  So he didn't want to look like,  you know,  this fucking white sissy.  Oh,  he tried three times to fucking fight this.  And the guy was just killing him.  And then the guy finally got him like a choke.  Yep.  And,  uh,  the guy was going out.  He was not going out.  And his friends were all going,  tap,  tap.  And he's tapping his own leg.  The guy was tapping his own leg.  Yeah.  Panicking.  Yep.  And then he fucking finally tapped the guy.  And that was,  and he goes,  and then he stood up and he goes,  uh,  I ain't trying to do that shit.  Yeah.  And that was the end of the fight. 
[01:37:00]  Cause he knew he was about to get knocked unconscious.  And then later on,  some black guy just belted him in the face for no apparent reason in the video.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  At the end.  The guy was like walking down the sidewalk and he's like still kind of woozy.  Yeah.  And some big black guy just belts him in the side of the head.  The black dude.  Yeah.  Oh,  his hat went flying.  Oh,  I didn't see that.  That was the guy that invited the white kid back to his house,  which was uncomfortable for the white kid.  He was just trying to protect the woman.  Now he's got to hang out.  Now he's got to hang out with the black guys.  In the projects.  Yeah.  You know,  not knowing if it's a fucking,  with his new friends trying to,  his new friends,  trying to be,  yeah, 
[01:37:30]  man.  And just let me go.  What was the dynamic of it?  Did we know who the woman was?  Maybe the woman knew the guy that punched the fucking dude at the end.  Oh,  maybe,  maybe that.  And that's why the black guys weren't really jumping in either.  I don't know if they would anyway though.  They didn't like,  they didn't like,  if it was one of their buddies,  they'd have jumped in.  Maybe,  maybe the guy,  maybe she was getting out of pocket.  Maybe out of pocket.  Yeah.  He's trying to set his,  put the goon hand down on that bitch.  I like a good fight video.  Like when one guy gets knocked out, 
[01:38:00]  cause you realize it sucks and it's humiliating,  but you also realize it's very survivable.  It's like most of the time those guys get up in a couple of minutes.  It's not man.  I've been knocked out.  I woke up four hours later.  Oh man.  I got knocked out.  You got more than knocked out.  You got kicked.  Yeah.  But still you,  when you,  man,  I got punched.  I was the fuck out one punch on the ground.  Fuck out.  Well,  what I was saying was that like you,  you realize it's survivable.  All the other kicks.  You don't know if that,  I mean,  I could have been out for four hours,  but there were those other times where you see guys get stomped and that's when it gets ugly. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  Like watching a guy get punched is like,  it is what it is.  You get punched,  but watching a guy get fucking,  then the brutal ones like,  Oh boy.  Yeah.  That's what you're afraid.  Everyone is going to be a brutal,  brutal fucking stomping.  Yeah.  On a knockout is like psychologically.  Okay.  With me is when it's like some fucking bully or somebody who deserves it.  Oh,  and then the guy knocks him the fuck out.  I love that. 
[01:39:00]  Psychologically.  I can handle that.  But when it's just my bodyguard,  this is Moody's bike.  Moody's bike.  He didn't even knock.  Didn't that fucking kid didn't even knock out Matt Dillon.  He just bloodied his nose.  Yeah.  He broke my nose.  But he knocked out the other guy.  What was the big fucking douchebag's name?  Mike.  Oh,  Mike.  Mike.  And Linderman finally beat up Mike.  Yeah.  Sloppy Linderman.  Mike would have killed him.  Is this your tough guy bike?  Yeah.  That was a fucking.  I want to be tough guy too.  I want to be tough guy.  Yeah.  This is Moody's bike now.  Get off.  And they were all like, 
[01:39:30]  Oh,  why is he a pussy?  Why is Linderman a pussy?  He's a murderer.  And that was in Firefly.  Yeah.  It's a great show.  All star.  He was in,  he was also in Independence Day.  Oh,  look at this awful woman.  He was.  Yeah.  He shot the fucking gun.  He shot the gun.  The can.  Adam Baldwin.  He was in Full Metal Jacket too.  Yeah,  yeah.  He was Adam,  my mother.  He's fucking,  he's a crazy motherfucker on Twitter.  Holy shit.  Oh,  is he on Twitter?  Oh my God.  Is he really?  He's very political.  Oh God.  That's all it is.  Very conservative. 
[01:40:00]  Adam Baldwin,  huh?  Yeah.  That's one thing you want to,  like,  I mean,  I try to do my politics and mix it in,  but it's like,  you don't want to be the boring guy who only,  Yeah,  that's what it is.  who gets so married to an ideology that you forget that our job is to be entertaining.  Yeah,  yeah.  It's hard to bleed on the air.  It's hard to not get caught up in that.  But an actor's,  they're not,  their job isn't to be entertaining off air.  Mm-hmm.  I mean,  your job is,  you're a comic,  but they're not,  they're,  they're just fucking actors.  That's it.  And they're boring.  Most times they're very boring.  Most actors have less followers than a comedian. 
[01:40:30]  I mean,  if you look at,  yeah,  I mean,  you look on,  like I was on that 2-2 show,  I had a lot,  I had more followers from O&A and doing comedy than a lot of these stars did.  I came to a grinding halt with followers.  Oh,  dude,  I'm just under 100,000,  but I can't crack 100,000.  Do you know what the key is?  It's,  and I found this,  it's like if you become more famous.  Yeah,  that's probably the key.  it's the way,  it's like,  I,  I,  I hit that too.  You hit these walls and then you go way above it.  It's when you start, 
[01:41:00]  you just keep doing Twittering jokes.  And that sounds corny,  but then people retweet you.  And that's how I found I'm getting a bunch of new followers.  Oh,  but you got to be funny.  No,  no,  no,  no.  But no,  meaning I,  I,  with plugs,  I'm careful.  Like I plug by trying to do it too much because they'll allow you some plugs.  Like one guy even goes,  you're special,  stupid plug it.  Like I try not to do,  I don't get it though.  I hate all plugs.  It really annoys me.  Yeah,  I don't,  but once in a while people will tolerate if it's,  if you have nothing to plug,  if you had shit to plug, 
[01:41:30]  you,  not you,  dumb,  dumb.  I would,  if you had something to plug,  you wouldn't hate all plugs.  I would.  He has nothing to plug.  He does his compound show.  He's got this show.  I plugged that one last night.  I did one.  It was fun.  Oh,  you did a compound show.  Yeah,  it was fun.  It was all about race.  He's got his asshole to plug with a cock.  Subtle,  Jim.  Hold on a second.  Let me finish.  He's got his mouth to plug with a bunch of dicks.  What else you got?  Horse shit.  He's got his,  yeah.  Hey,  horse shit.  You want to plug your ears? 
[01:42:00]  Fuck you,  horse.  Yeah,  what are you,  a bunch of horses?  This is not cow.  That's true.  Yeah.  Horse shit.  God,  I haven't been called that in years.  Brings back great memories.  Thanks.  But yeah,  that's what's,  and too many back and forths for people,  which,  but I've gotten into those two where it's hard not to.  Oh,  I do that all the time.  It's so hard not to.  I don't do it.  I do it all the time,  and I just get fucking annoyed,  and I realize,  this guy's got four followers.  Why am I bothering?  The best way is your way.  I fucking block him. 
[01:42:30]  I just block him.  I go in.  I do that thing.  I'll go and read,  I'll look at their followers,  and then I'll read their tweets.  Yes.  And usually,  the meanest,  toughest talkers  have some type of puppy photo  on their Facebook,  or a little baby,  and they have some stupid blog  that they wrote about society,  or fucking how to change.  Fuck you.  You fucking tough.  Then I just block him.  Fuck him.  I think some of my posts also  keep more followers away.  Some of my,  maybe racial posts, 
[01:43:00]  that...  But you do a lot of re...  You do a thing where you go,  you have the person's question,  space, space,  and then your answer.  And then my answer, yeah.  That's kind of like,  that's the Anthony Twitter.  Yes, it is.  A little dash,  and then the answer.  You'll break 100,000.  Eventually,  but I'm also not,  I'm not verified.  I don't have the little  verification check mark.  We should get you that.  I don't know how to do it.  Seems annoying.  Dane helped me,  because he knew the guys.  I think Dane helped Opie, too.  See, I don't know.  Text Dane.  I'll text Dane.  Oh. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, just text him.  He'll help you.  I don't know.  I went to the Twitter offices,  and the kid,  he was an ONA fan.  I was in San Fran,  where they are.  And he goes,  you want to come by,  you can come by.  And I don't think he really meant it,  but I just,  literally 10 minutes later,  I'm out front,  and he was like,  all right.  And I showed up,  hey.  I met,  he brought me in the cafeteria.  You have Fonzie.  Hey.  Tunzie.  Sorry, Bob.  He's just mean. 
[01:44:00]  He's just mean, Jim.  He's just mean.  Potsy roast.  He's just mean.  Ralph, open mouth.  I'm sorry, Bob.  Do we stop saying sorry?  I just say it.  It makes it worse.  Richie Lovingham.  I don't like Jimmy's new thing,  where he says sorry after.  It hurts more.  It's like,  it's like he's raping me,  and saying sorry. 
[01:44:30]  Oh,  is that fucking great?  That was four,  that was four,  six good ones.  Right off the bat.  Richie Tunningham.  All,  all,  all in the happy,  all in the happy.  Richie,  give me a ham.  It's so funny  that we can actually  bust balls in theme.  Of course.  When Fonzie would walk in  and see Joanie,  hey,  eat this shortcake.  Sorry,  shortcake eater.  I don't like that one.  That was boo.  There'd be plenty of boos 
[01:45:00]  in these rants.  A couple of days will come.  A couple.  That's all you need.  Is that the worst  of getting slammed  in Anthony's laugh  at the end of it?  It sounds like  a double punchline.  Somebody on Twitter  last night said,  I guess Jimmy had said,  oh,  when you did  the home run,  cool me.  Home run,  fucking home run.  I get that too  in the hashtags,  home run,  cool me.  Home run,  cool me.  And someone said,  I love your laugh  after this.  And I wrote something  that's probably 
[01:45:30]  cost me some followers.  You should hear me  after a good crib death joke.  People didn't like that.  Unfollow, unfollow, unfollow.  Unfollow, unfollow, unfollow.  Yeah,  that's collateral damage.  Yeah.  What makes you so funny  is going to cost you.  Yeah.  I picked up 2,000 followers  after the Tonight Show thing.  Oh, wow.  How heavy was that?  Oh,  oh boy.  It was the same  as it would be  if I, 
[01:46:00]  you got nothing.  lifted you.  Oh.  Of course I had something  to joke.  The joke was  I didn't say.  Whoops.  Oh, whoopsie.  Why did you help?  You helped.  I thought he said it.  No,  it was,  because the picture,  there was a picture.  I wasn't going to eat  that sandwich.  Now I have,  the pain inside  just makes me want  to start chewing.  After the,  after the fucking,  they twittered a picture 
[01:46:30]  with myself  and Leno  and Bieber  and we were all  hashed.  You met Bieber?  Yeah,  I did Leno with him.  We were all  on the fucking same  and Justin Bieber  retweeted it  but it just happened  to have my name in it.  That's nice.  So I picked up  a couple thousand followers  from that.  Yeah, yeah.  But I know  that you fucking lost  immediately when they  read your other tweets.  Believe me,  I know I'm going to  lose all of them  but they just don't know  that I'm not friends  with them.  I just happen to be  on a show.  I got a lot of Dane  followers a bunch of times  and they realize  that I hang out  with you fucking creeps  and they immediately 
[01:47:00]  fucking douche me.  Yeah.  It's not you.  It's us.  There's nothing worse  too when they come,  they'll see me do that  or they see me with Dane  on the show  doing like,  you know,  20 minutes or so  and then they'll come  to my show  and they'll be like,  that's not the same.  It's not the same as Dane.  I don't like this.  Well, he's very angry.  Yeah.  He seems very mad.  Dane's a lot more  happier than this guy.  And funny.  Yeah.  Well, why don't we  take a little break  and then we'll come back 
[01:47:30]  and talk more  amongst ourselves.  Thank you.  We'll be right back.  Sirius XM.  This is the  OPNN 3 Show.  The show's here  and you're texting.  Let's go.  You can let the music  establish.  Establish?  Is that what they call it  in the biz?  I guess so.  Letting the music establish?  I've heard it.  Let's let the music establish  for three seconds.  Yeah. 
[01:48:00]  All right.  Watch.  Hey, how you doing?  We're back.  See?  That let the music establish.  Do you really need to go to school  for this job?  No.  To be a jock?  School for radio is stupid.  You really don't need it.  You either need some type of talent  or the ability to speak.  You have to be comfortable  with public type speaking  then there.  You just described things  you are all not good at. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah, exactly.  That none of you have.  None of us have.  Now,  the school thing for radio  is like,  well,  I don't have to know  what type of alloy  the transmitter antenna  is made out of.  Back in the day,  they're fucking...  Sam knows that stuff.  I didn't go to school for radio.  What is the...  What did you go to school for?  Nothing.  I went to the school  of hard knocks,  my friend.  School of hard knocks.  I'm a sociologist by trade.  What?  Ew.  What is that?  I have a degree in sociology. 
[01:49:00]  I'm a sociopath.  That's what you are.  Maybe.  What does a sociology degree  get you?  Nothing.  It gets me out of school quicker  so I can try to get a job here.  Oh, yeah?  Yep.  So why'd you go?  To get the internship,  to get the college credits.  Couldn't you have gotten  an internship  by just going to  community college  or something?  Yeah,  but then I also was  on the college radio stations there.  And I got to intern  with the Great Scorch.  Oh, right.  What did the college radio station 
[01:49:30]  do for you?  Nothing.  Just gave me experience  on the air.  You could literally  just fucking send  a letter,  an email  to a radio show  and go,  look,  hey,  I'm into radio.  Here's my tape.  I'd like to come in  and intern for you.  No, they wouldn't let you  anymore, I don't think.  Not here anymore.  No, it's all corporate  and no, they wouldn't.  Well, back in the day.  Yeah, back then.  Sam,  Sam,  the space between  Sam's top lip  and the bottom of his nose  is so fucking huge. 
[01:50:00]  Like Fred Flintstone.  Mustache  would be  fucking enormous.  You should grow a mustache.  It would be a four inch  like my dad.  A four inch by six inch mustache.  He's got that Bloomberg mouth.  Yeah.  Does that have a cock in it?  Yeah.  You should grow a mustache.  You think so?  Yeah, do it, please.  If you grew a mustache,  it would be so big.  It would be a huge mustache.  You think so?  Yeah.  Would it look good?  It would look like  one of your eyebrows.  Hold on, don't move. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, yeah, I could picture it.  You'd look like a tough guy.  Oh, really?  I think you'd look like  a tough guy.  Yeah, Mr. Majestic.  Yeah.  Come on.  I'll consider it.  It probably won't happen.  Wow, Bloomberg.  Yeah, look at that space.  Yeah, you guys both  have the same...  Bloomberg's got that big.  Whatever the fuck  that thing is called.  It's very distinguished.  You've got to do that, dude.  Right?  It's not distinguished.  You don't think so?  No.  You've got like  some five o'clock shadow  going there.  Yeah, well, three days. 
[01:51:00]  When did you shave?  Three days ago, yeah.  So you don't grow  beards very quick.  You could grow  a solid beard, though.  Yeah, it's not patchy.  No.  You should grow a mustache.  Just the mustache.  A Magnum P.I.  Just cut it off  right there.  70s porno.  Just a fat mustache.  Top mustache.  Yeah.  Just let it grow out.  Like Josh Brolin  in American Gangster.  Yeah.  A fucking money-taking  bad guy.  Josh Brolin can grow  a good mustache.  He's a great actor, too, right?  He is really goddamn good.  Yeah, he is.  He was in Goonies. 
[01:51:30]  Who's married to  fucking Barbra Streisand?  Really?  Yeah, he was the older  brother in Goonies.  The guy that's down...  The older kid  that was down there  with them.  That's him?  That's Josh Brolin.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  I know, right?  I was just watching  Goonies the other day  and I'm like,  oh, I forgot he was  in this motherfucker.  Who's married  to Barbra Streisand?  That's his father,  James Brolin.  Oh, James Brolin.  That's his father?  James Brolin,  Mr. Barbra Streisand.  He was in  Knott's Landing  or Falcon Crest  or one of those shows, right?  Was he in that?  He was in one of those  nighttime soap... 
[01:52:00]  Fucking blubble mouth  nighttime soap operas.  Yeah, I think he was.  You're right.  But before that,  he was in...  Was he in...  Filtrum.  Was he the guy  in Marcus Welby, M.D.?  Was he in Marcus Welby?  M.D.?  Well, isn't she like 65 or 66  so James Brolin's  probably the same age.  James Brolin was in Westworld.  You ever see Westworld?  Uh-uh.  Where nothing could possibly  go wrong.  Go wrong.  Go wrong.  Go wrong.  That was the trailer. 
[01:52:30]  Was it really?  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  That was the trailer.  Yul Brenner was in it  and he played a cowboy, right?  And it was this kind of  a virtual reality...  Not even virtual reality.  It was reality,  but they had robots  and you could go into Westworld  or medieval world and stuff,  but they pretty much  focused on Westworld.  And you packed guns.  You dressed like cowboys.  There were horses,  but they were all robots.  But they had real guns.  But the sensors on the guns  made it so you couldn't  shoot people with it.  You know?  You could only shoot the robots. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, wow.  Oh, is this the trailer?  Your attention, please.  They're flying a plane.  See, that's James Brolin.  The ultimate resort.  Yeah, he was in...  And the other guy.  He was in, like,  fucking Knott's Landing  or something like that.  Locking in now.  Walls where you can live out  your every fantasy.  There's Roman world.  Oh, they're on a plane  watching this.  Yeah.  Medieval world.  Chivalry and combat.  Look at the futuristic stuff  they got. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, just light bulbs.  And Westworld.  Lawless violence  on the American frontier  of the 1880s.  Each resort is maintained  by reliable computer technology.  Ah, reliable.  And peopled  by lifelike robot men and women.  See?  Let's stand by for resort.  There's no black people.  No.  On six,  on five,  on four,  on three,  on two.  Activate.  Now.  Fucking Westworld. 
[01:54:00]  And then everything  starts moving.  Even the horses  are robots.  With an unforgettable vacation.  Dinner at seven,  breakfast at 6.30.  Get lunch on your own.  Don't look like much here,  but we have everything.  You mean to tell me  he's a robot?  What would it be?  Uh,  I'd like a martini on the rocks  with a twist of lemon.  Very dry, please.  Just give him whiskey.  He's new in town.  Many elements  of the Delos resort  are potentially dangerous.  I wonder why  this isn't on anymore.  I know, right?  No, it was a movie.  Was it?  Kill that. 
[01:54:30]  See?  It's a big gunfight  that he has at Yul Brynner.  Oh, man.  Oh, wow.  The technology  is designed  to provide all this  for complete safety.  I never saw this.  I never saw this.  The frustrations  find release.  He keeps coming back.  The Yul Brynner cowboy  keeps coming back.  Wow.  They keep fixing him.  Not the one in real life.  And they get whores.  No.  And all in a controlled environment. 
[01:55:00]  They get robot whores?  Robot rattlesnake.  That's not supposed to happen.  Uh-oh.  We know you'll enjoy  your stay in Westworld.  They recast that roll.  It was with Bill Paxton.  I could hear it.  Yeah.  It wasn't supposed to happen.  Nothing can possibly go wrong.  Good shot.  That's him, too.  Go wrong.  Go wrong.  Oh, my God.  Shut down.  Shut down immediately.  And they can't.  They can't shut down.  And all the robots went crazy  and started killing  all the real people.  Oh, wow. 
[01:55:30]  It's insane.  Is it good?  Yeah, it's dated,  but it's kind of fun to watch.  It is funny to hear  how the computers,  it really is just light bulbs.  Yeah, yeah, light bulbs.  Jesus Christ.  Kenny just scared  the fuck out of me.  What'd you think?  It was Yul Brynner?  Well, he came in  with a creepy sci-fi music  and then he came in.  Well, he's a robot.  Yeah.  Kenny is like a robot.  Yeah, what's he,  from Westworld or something?  Oh, Chippa.  God.  He did a Simpsons episode  on this,  on Westworld.  Yeah.  Oh, he was in Hotel.  That was, 
[01:56:00]  James Brolin was in that  kind of show.  Hotel, there you go.  One of those shows.  That's a type of show.  James Brolin was in  a lot of shit  back in the 70s and stuff.  He was like the heartthrob  back then.  What a genius idea  for a movie, though.  Yeah, it was pretty good.  Imagine what they could do  with that now, though,  like your virtual reality place.  Yes, exactly.  Using CGI.  I think it could be.  They should remake that.  Why haven't they  remade that one?  That's one they should remake.  Fuck it up.  Yeah, they will fuck it up.  Because of, uh...  Like, he was so great.  CGI.  CGI could really do 
[01:56:30]  a good job, I think,  with that.  I saw that in what  they call the movie theater.  Jesus.  I remember it.  Are you kidding me?  I was a very little kid  when that came out.  Well, you consider  a little kid  and what we consider  a little kid  are two different things.  Right.  And you know what?  They gave out  when you went  to the movie theater.  They handed out  these cardboard pistols  and it had, like,  paper in it.  That had to be  a long time ago.  So when you flip  the pistol down,  the paper would pop out  and we'd go,  and we'd make a bang sound. 
[01:57:00]  They gave away  cardboard guns at the fucking...  Wait, for that movie?  Yeah.  I wonder how much  one of those...  Can we look on eBay?  How much of one of those  worth?  Westworld cardboard...  I wonder if there's any.  There's gotta be some.  I swear it was there.  If there's a Honus Wagner card,  there's a Westworld gun.  Westworld fucking paper gun.  Honus Wagner.  Yeah.  There's a fucking...  Where nothing can possibly go wrong.  Can we just acknowledge  how serious Sam is today,  which is bugging me.  Well, he takes this role 
[01:57:30]  very seriously.  His replacing Opie fucking...  I'm not even talking.  ...role.  He really...  His...  Say it again.  ...I want this job so bad...  Say it again.  ...replacing Opie role.  Oh, wait a minute.  Go back, go back.  I might have seen it.  Go back a little more.  A little more.  No, sorry.  God damn it.  I thought I saw  the Westworld gun.  Did you like it?  Oh, I was around the house  the whole time doing it  until my father was like,  Knock off that racket!  Stop it!  Take that outside! 
[01:58:00]  I wanted to use my dad's tools  to make something once  in the basement,  and he told me  not to bust his chops.  Stop busting my chops!  And I was like,  Okay, I won't,  because I thought  one of the tools  was called the chops,  and as long as I didn't  break it,  I could use his tools.  And then I went,  Okay, that's it!  That's it!  So wait, the Westworld...  Westworld.  That was the gun.  Holy shit,  that is fucked up, dude.  I'm looking at that  like it was yesterday. 
[01:58:30]  So wait a minute,  now there's a big...  It's a gun.  And it wasn't.  No, it was many yesterdays.  There's like a red flag  around it almost  that says Westworld on it.  What would...  How would they pop out?  It would pop out,  like a paper would pop out.  It would make a pfft sound.  It would come out  of the front, really,  a paper,  like a triangle.  Paper was folded  into that red part,  and you'd go like this,  and it would open like that,  and the paper would go pfft.  Yeah, we used to make them  in elementary school  to just make a noise.  It would just catch air 
[01:59:00]  and make a pfft sound.  Is it worth any money?  Are there any on eBay?  No, there's not on eBay.  I could try to find a value  if you want.  Wow, that's...  Holy shit.  Just seeing that,  it's like,  holy fuck.  The Westworld gun.  Yeah.  Giving away a movie theater.  Imagine, like,  in this day and age,  they would be like,  what are you doing?  You can't give away  fucking images of guns.  Well, you've never gotten  anything at a fucking movie theater.  No?  No, I've never.  They never...  Ass raping?  No?  A blowjob?  Yeah, like,  you never had a midnight  cowboy movie experience?  Yes.  We just blew a guy  and took your notebook. 
[01:59:30]  What was...  What year was that?  74?  Three.  Three.  That was 73.  I was three.  Yikes.  Were you?  Yeah.  Aw.  A little kid.  I was three.  You were a little kid.  10, 12.  10, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12.  I was, uh...  I was 25 now.  Yeah, right.  Oh, Chip.  Chip.  Chip.  Chip, Chip.  Yeah, that was, uh...  I remember that one. 
[02:00:00]  I'm trying to think of any other things they might have...  I've never gotten anything...  I don't think in a movie theater.  I've never gotten anything.  Well, that was a big promotional...  Yeah.  ...item for, uh, for the day.  Have I?  To make a noise so your parents are getting mad at you.  How much was a movie back then, too?  It must have been a fucking...  Two dollars.  You're talking to fucking Grandpa?  We can knock it off.  I'm not being...  How much was a movie back then?  Well, we would walk to the movie house.  Well, and we'd give them a bale of hay.  The Nickelodeon. 
[02:00:30]  Two dollars?  Sometimes I'd trade sugar.  Wow, they found one.  Where is it?  It sold on May 24th of this very year for nine dollars and ninety-nine cents plus two dollars  and ninety-nine first class.  Amazing how you think something's going to be worth something and it's utterly...  I found a bunch of stuff in my house.  These old, like, Planet of the Apes and Hulk fucking, uh...  They're like these little hard comic books that had a little .45 record with them. 
[02:01:00]  And I'm like, oh boy, these are probably worth money.  Ten, twelve dollars.  It's amazing just because it's old doesn't mean it's worth anything.  Well, you want to pawn it or sell it?  What are you...  Rick from fucking Pawn Stars.  Well, I brought in my rare, very rare Westworld theater paper gun.  Um, it's pretty cool, but, uh, I'm going to talk to a friend of mine.  He's an expert on, uh, paper theater guns.  All right, I do.  Yeah, I'm going to get my guide down here and then we can get a valuation.  Well, uh, Rick wants to bring someone in. 
[02:01:30]  I'm kind of interested to see what the expert will say.  Hey, here he comes.  How you doing, Rick?  Hi, how you doing?  What do you got for me?  I got this, uh, Westworld paper gun.  Uh, yeah, let me look.  Yes, this was, uh, put out, uh, back in those days they would make these promotional items  for movies and, uh, you know, it was, it kind of brought a little more fun to the movie.  Yeah, I see.  Um, so what do you think?  Well, it's in good condition, but I've seen these online.  You don't see them in this kind of shape.  It's great because usually the kids have been playing with them and they're all shot to shit 
[02:02:00]  and this one's great.  It's in great condition.  So, uh, what do you think it's worth?  Nothing.  Nah, probably ten bucks at most.  And you see the number from the original?  Twenty thousand.  Twenty thousand dollars.  It was twenty thousand.  And, uh, I need to make money off of this, so I'll give you two dollars and fifty cents  for it.  Wow.  Oh, I guess I'll just keep it.  I gotta frame it.  I gotta rebuild it.  It's gonna be sitting here for a while.  It's gonna take up space in the cabin.  It's gonna take up space.  The buyers that do it, they're very rare. 
[02:02:30]  They come in once every three years from Chicago.  I love that guy.  Fucking cocksucker.  Oh, he's fucking the worst.  They had an old lady on last night.  She needed money so bad.  They're in Vegas.  Of course she did.  She had...  Yes, he's probably gonna gamble her life away.  Chip, good one.  She, uh...  It was ten grand, Elvis document.  Uh-huh.  It was ten grand.  And she was...  Oh my...  And then the fuck...  Let me get in my expert.  Dude comes down and just... 
[02:03:00]  Yeah, this is a copy.  This is...  See how all the ink is the same?  It's a fucking Xerox copy of an old Elvis contract.  She, and he's a guest...  I don't believe it.  That was pretty much it.  Yeah, yeah.  But at the end, she was just holding back to you.  She goes, well, I really needed the money, and I thought this could have solved the problems.  Oh, it's not gonna solve the problems.  You know what they do?  Cheap buy.  What Jonathan told me they do when a celebrity dies like that, when, like, Elvis...  And because the Beatles catalog used to be at their office, is when, like, when Harrison 
[02:03:30]  died or whatever, they immediately lock all of the fucking cabinets, because people  go in and steal the signed contracts.  So they have them.  Oh shit, really?  Yeah, and I forget, he says some guy from Apple, which was, you know, the Beatles' old  label, or it was still the label, had every fucking cabinet's locked, so if they die, you  can't just run in and steal contracts, because they're worth so much fucking money with their  signature on them.  That's like money.  By the way, that's why Apple...  That's why the Beatles weren't on iTunes for a long time, because them and Apple have 
[02:04:00]  been in litigation for so many years.  Stop it.  Over the name.  That's true.  Over the name, and they finally...  Apple Records had it first.  Exactly.  But then Apple...  Oh, so the record company went after the computer company.  Oh yeah, a bunch of times.  I think they won a few times, and then they started losing.  I don't know what the agreement was.  It's so weird.  But yeah.  It's like the WWF had to change the WWE.  Yeah, for the World Wildlife Federation.  Now all the videos on Netflix, they have to phase out the F. 
[02:04:30]  Do they?  Yeah.  Yeah, they have to blur out the F.  Why blur it out?  Why watch it?  Jesus Christ.  You're watching old wrestling?  You can't not watch it.  It's fucking...  Watch me.  But why wouldn't it fucking...  It's hilarious.  Why wouldn't the World Wildlife Federation change their name?  No one cares about them.  Aw, the little panda.  Yeah, all they gotta do is...  It's adorable.  Wide world...  Wilderness...  From a branding point, though. 
[02:05:00]  ...wellness federation.  Didn't even hurt them.  No, it didn't.  WWE?  They went right to WWE.  No one gave a fuck.  I thought it would maybe make a little dent.  No one gave a shit.  No, yeah, yeah.  And now most people don't say WWF.  Everybody says WWF.  They've been saying that for a while.  They're branding geniuses.  It wasn't even in the United States.  They were okay with it in the United States.  It was their overseas shit.  It was the website shit that changed everything.  Yes.  Stupid.  But yeah, like when you look at the old tapes, now the F is blurred out and the announcing  is dropped out. 
[02:05:30]  I lost to a goddamn panda!  Vince came back.  What's dropped out?  Vince came back.  If it says for the WWF championship, it would just say for the championship.  Oh, wow.  I was watching.  There was that time where they were just trying to edge out WCW when Nitro was beating  them all the time.  So they were just getting real fucking edgy.  Yeah.  And Vince was taking his pants down.  Oh, yeah.  He loved taking his pants down.  And making guys kiss his ass. 
[02:06:00]  Oh, yeah.  Kiss my ass!  Kiss my ass!  That's right!  Get a gun!  Pucker up and kiss my ass!  Yeah.  That was good.  Those were great days.  The fucking stink phase.  Heavy on the gay.  Heavy on the gay.  Rikishi's ass.  Oh, all the asses.  Oh, just sticking your face in a guy's ass.  Oh, amazing.  And children were in the crowd.  You could see their faces.  It really got disturbing, yeah.  What Vince was just like writing to entertain himself. 
[02:06:30]  No, we'll have you in a thong and you'll rub your ass in their faces.  Yeah.  It was a little-  Look at the old broads out there.  Show their tits!  Yeah.  What's her name?  Moolah.  Moolah.  Moolah.  And Mae Young.  And Mae Young.  And Val Venus will come out and spray.  Come on, everybody, with a super soldier.  Oh, an ass man.  Oh, who doesn't love the ass man?  I love the ass man.  What does the ass man like to do?  Well, the ass man loves doing a few things.  There's a bunch of different things.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:07:00]  And they're all done with an ass.  Love him.  Love him.  I love to kick him.  Kick him.  I love to shove him.  Shove him.  Shove the ass.  I love to stick him.  Stick an ass?  Stick an ass.  What?  I love to watch him.  Watch him?  Watch your ass.  I love to pick him.  Kick him.  And I'm gonna kick him.  That's right.  Kick him.  Why?  Ass man.  Yeah.  You like this song?  Yeah.  I'm an ass man.  One of the best WWF wrestler.  Bring him on.  A song's ever made.  Oh, yeah.  This fucking song. 
[02:07:30]  I'm an ass man.  I'm an ass man to come out.  You know, we never get to the second verse.  No.  So many asses.  So little time.  Oh.  A little type of can't stop me on the down.  I'm a lover of every kind.  Listen to this.  The best surprises always stick up from behind.  Wow.  Ass man.  Yeah.  The surprises from behind.  I'm an ass man.  Like asses.  We get it.  It's great.  I'm an ass man.  He's an ass man. 
[02:08:00]  I'm an ass man.  Yeah.  Sam knows the hi-hat.  Oh, yeah.  This is great.  What a great song that is.  Yeah.  Fucking A.  Who is that?  What was his name?  The wrestler?  Mr. Ass.  Mr. Ass.  Badass Billy Gunn.  Badass Billy Gunn.  The saddest part about that is that guy who's singing with that unbelievable fucking beautiful  rock and roll, jazz, blues voice had dreams, had hopes, had, seriously, just had hopes and  dreams.  Like, you know, now he's in a fucking studio in his house in his basement and his wife 
[02:08:30]  comes down.  Do you excuse me?  Honey, I'm doing ass man.  Hang on.  Yeah.  I got to put the song together.  What are you doing?  Yeah.  Ass man.  For the wrestling thing?  I'm an ass man.  Vince is calling with idea for lyrics.  Yeah.  I've got another idea.  Yeah.  I got it.  All right.  How about I love to kick them?  I love to lick them, touch them, poke them.  Just come up with things to do with an ass.  I'm writing this down.  Hang on.  What do you want to do with these asses?  Just come up with more things to do with an ass.  All right.  All right. 
[02:09:00]  All right, Vince.  How many lines didn't make it?  I like to chop them.  No.  No.  You don't chop an ass.  No.  God damn it.  Yeah.  Who chops an ass?  Yeah.  I like to bike them.  You don't bike an ass.  No.  What?  No.  You can kick it.  You can stick it.  Yeah.  You can kind of stick it.  Yeah.  Of course.  He loves that ass.  He's an ass man.  Something from like 98.  And I forgot how awful, how edgy their storylines were.  Yeah.  In 98, they had Val Venus tying up. 
[02:09:30]  Oh, by the way, look at the commercial.  WWF.org.  Ah, yeah.  Look at the little kitten tiger.  Yeah, they're playing.  Oh, they're adorable.  Until they bite your face off.  Oh, yeah.  They had Val Venus tying up Goldust in the ropes and making him watch as Val Venus had  just filmed a porno tape with his wife.  It was like, what?  The storyline is here.  Is this Val's music?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Val Venus had come out.  Where's Val Venus these days?  His video was just like a hot dog being put in a bun and a train going into a tunnel and 
[02:10:00]  like a rocket being launched.  Oh, that's right.  Where's Val Venus' video?  God damn, I remember his...  Did you ever meet Val Venus?  I've met Val Venus before, yeah.  Would you know if he came in?  Yeah.  I would know him if he came in.  Yeah.  Is that...  They show a fucking thread being tapped, flowers opening up, him with a big purple helmet,  hot dogs going into buns. 
[02:10:30]  He would film vignettes with like Jenna Jameson and stuff.  This is hilarious.  Was he a big wrestler?  Yeah.  Val Venus?  He was pretty big.  I never heard of him.  He was pretty fucking huge in the 90s.  What happened to him?  I mean, they couldn't have porno stars wrestling after a while.  But that Goldust was a homo.  Yeah, it was a gay guy.  Goldust was a gay guy.  Yeah, his whole method of intimidation was he would try to kiss wrestlers. 
[02:11:00]  He would try to kick...  Goldust was the fucking creepiest wrestler ever.  He would take his outfit off and he'd have things on his nipples.  Was he popular?  He was the first edgy wrestler.  Oh, yeah.  It was when everything was cartoony and then one day, Goldust came out in all gold body  paint and he was feuding with Razor Ramon and he'd unzip his outfit and he had a big  heart with the word Razor tattooed on his chest.  Oh, was he popular?  Very popular.  He was very popular, but he was so... 
[02:11:30]  He was controversial.  Oh, God.  What happened to him?  Controversial.  What happened to him?  He's not wrestling anymore.  Have you met him?  I don't know if I...  No.  Didn't he wear high heels once in a while?  Well, he wrestled a match with Roddy Piper once and they took his outfit off and he  had women's lingerie on.  And there's tight bars.  That's him?  Yeah.  Of my magical, mystic land, there are evil, dark ghouls that walk astray. 
[02:12:00]  This is terrible.  It's a Dusty Rhodes' son under the face paint.  That's who it is?  Yeah.  That's Goldust?  Yeah, Dusty Rhodes' son is Goldust.  This is so stupid.  Purple and black.  Right.  Dusty Rhodes had a feminine...  It was hypnotically walking.  Dusty Rhodes?  Yeah, a little bit.  He was more of a jive talker, though.  A 70s jive talker.  Yeah, he was like a...  He was a...  I like Dusty Rhodes.  I think I just liked his name.  He was very popular.  Was he? 
[02:12:30]  Look at Lick.  You see?  Yeah.  Gold shits no darkness.  What?  Oh, yuck.  This is terrible.  Why would you want to fucking watch this?  Look at his hat.  Look at him.  And he's threatening the Undertaker.  Oh, God.  Like this?  His whole thing was like, I'm going to kiss you, so watch out.  And they'd be like, ew.  And then he'd beat them up.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  That's stupid.  Which still works to this day in a real fight.  Yeah.  But this isn't exciting.  Like, this isn't very exciting.  No, because this came on the TV and you were like, what the fuck is this? 
[02:13:00]  But it's dull.  It's not like fucking...  Oh, my God.  Dang.  That was Vince.  Can I hear Dusty Rhodes talk?  It's been...  He was one of my favorites.  Goldust started a feud with Ahmed Johnson by Ahmed Johnson, who's just this big black  guy from Pearl River, Mississippi.  Yeah.  He got knocked out in a match and they were stretching him out and Goldust ran over to  him and went, oh, no.  Oh, no.  And started giving him mouth to mouth.  Goldust is funny, dude.  This whole thing was that all the good guy wrestlers were homophobic. 
[02:13:30]  So they hated him.  It's fucking funny.  Dusty Rhodes has been injured.  Look at that microphone.  Is this from 85?  Dusty Rhodes for his first...  This microphone is two feet long.  It's two feet long, dude.  And it's not even a wireless.  Dusty Rhodes and Dusty...  Look at his comb over.  His hair has parted over his ear.  Let's say Roland.  I would like to thank the many, many fans throughout this country that wrote cards and let it just 
[02:14:00]  wrote the imagine dream.  That hair is like Tinder.  It looks like corn husks.  Secondly, I want to thank Jim Crockett Promotions for waiting and taking the time because I know  how important it was.  Arcade 85.  It is to the rest of the fans against Jim Crockett Promotions.  And Dusty Rhodes the American Dream.  This is terrible mic work here.  No, Dusty was known for his mic work.  But this is from 85.  Danny, can you find one of him actually in a wrestling year where he was doing a mic...  He really did.  Was he just one of the early ones that was why? 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, Dusty was like...  Him and Ric Flair were the two biggest guys before Hulk Hogan.  Yeah.  Okay.  I remember when I was really young.  What happened to him?  Was he alive?  Dusty A still works for WWE behind the scenes, but not wrestling.  Wow.  Is he a young wrestler?  That is a young Vince.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  When he probably got back to the dressing room in Boston and went...  Because, Mr. Graham, you almost lost, man.  I was sweating.  Who was that guy?  That's Superstar.  That was Graham.  I thought it was. 
[02:15:00]  He just took a sweat and threw it in Vince's face.  Flung it into Vince's face.  Did you see that?  Yeah.  Hey, Sam, you ever see when Dr. D. David Schultz hit the reporter?  Yeah, I've seen...  Yes.  Of course I've seen it.  It's not like that.  Chip, no.  Chip, a wrestling fan.  This weekend is not wrestling, Sam.  I know what this weekend is.  I know.  Sam's going to expect Chael Sonnen to throw punches like this and step on the floor.  Yeah, no one's going to jump on the top of the octagon.  Yeah, but this fight's being built up like a wrestling match. 
[02:15:30]  Hey, nobody's getting hit by a coconut in this.  Who's the baby face and who's the heel?  There he is.  Chael Sonnen's probably the heel, right?  He's the heel, yeah.  Oh, shut up.  You know, traveling throughout this country, Dusty Rose is recognized everywhere because of his hats, not his eyes.  Because of his hair, his ability, and his rap, Dusty Rose is known all over the world.  They don't need to look at my face, my clothes, to know who I am.  Probably 85.  85?  We're talking about a half a million dollars a year, not a hundred dollars a week, you understand? 
[02:16:00]  That's what we're talking about.  Ric Flair going around the country talking about how great he is.  I just got a letter from a person named Owens out in Portland that's going to send me a kiss real shortly.  That's how strong we are.  And, Owens, I know that you're lifting right now, and I'm going to be bad for you, understand?  And this is when they were still trying to play it off like it was real.  This is before they identified it as sports entertainment.  Now then, on this day right here, we're going to start taking care of business, and that is my world's television title that you've got around your waist. 
[02:16:30]  Well, television title.  Now you've got to deal with me, and you've got to face the fact that there's no place you can hide, no place you can run, nowhere, baby doll, can stick that ugly face to us.  People thought this was real.  He's actually good on the mic, though.  This is great.  He is, right?  But not only did they think it was real, they wanted to literally kill Vince McMahon when he exposed it as being like, no, it's entertainment.  Oh, yeah.  Because people were like, oh, shit, Dusty Rhodes is fucking mad.  And Vince had to expose it for business reasons, right? 
[02:17:00]  I'm guessing for flight licenses, right?  For licenses, for taxing, for everything.  Why taxing?  Because it's like, it's just a show.  It's not boxing.  It's not a sport that has to adhere to rules and regulations.  Well, and so he didn't have to pay the people, I would imagine.  So if he was a sport, he would have to pay the wrestlers in a different way.  Maybe.  Do you like the Shockmaster, Bob?  Unionize and all that shit.  Have you seen the Shockmaster?  Shockmaster's the best.  It's one of the funniest fucking things ever. 
[02:17:30]  Stupid Shockmaster.  When he comes to the wall, it's the funniest thing ever.  He is the shock.  It's the master.  Oh, boy.  He just came back last week.  The dumb.  It's a Stormtrooper helmet spray painted with silver glitter.  You can't see through it.  You can't see through it.  Other than the Shockmaster.  This is the best.  By the way, that one move is about six months of blown storyline right there. 
[02:18:00]  Is it really?  Everything just blew up.  That's not what he was supposed to do.  He was supposed to be intimidating.  Do you think that this is...  Do you know who was impressed that I knew this clip?  Who?  I did a radio show with...  Oh, fuck.  Kenny might remember his name.  Carolehead?  No, it was in Florida, I think.  But he was just a wrestler who was on...  Who were some guys that wear masks?  The Abyss.  Oh, Abyss. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Kenny sent me that.  And he's so proud that I mentioned you.  You brought up the Shockmaster.  He was out of his mind that I knew it.  Yeah.  Do you think wrestlers fucking love this clip?  It's their favorite.  Is it?  His helmet falling off is great, too.  He's exposed.  And he's on his hands and knees with no helmet.  It really is the greatest thing ever.  It was a breakaway wall, but nobody mentioned that the bottom is lined by two-by-fours.  So he didn't realize he broke away the top part, but then had to step over the wooden part. 
[02:19:00]  So he tripped right over the two-by-fours.  He tripped over it.  The mask is a fucking...  It's a Darth Vader mask.  It's a Stormtrooper.  The Stormtrooper thing.  With silver glitter all over it.  It's obvious.  And he couldn't see through it.  Because they spray-painted over the eyes with silver glitter.  Perfect.  Has he...  Can we see this again, please?  Oh, yeah.  And then he quickly puts the helmet back on and gets up.  Do you think...  I wonder what they're thinking at the moment that he fell.  They had to be laughing.  Listen real close.  You can hear somebody go, oh, no. 
[02:19:30]  The shock master!  The shock master!  I told you.  Oh, God.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  He's wiping glimpses on his arm.  And you can hear...  You can hear everyone in the back going, oh, no, oh, no.  Because he's not doing his own voice.  There's a mic on someone in the back doing the voice.  Yeah, yeah.  So you can hear all the people around this guy going, oh, God. 
[02:20:00]  Oh, no.  Because the mic was already on.  They call me the shock master.  Oh, and then he's got to do it.  Wait, you're the guy that just fell down and your helmet fell off.  They're not intimidated by you.  You're just a fat lump of shit that fell through them.  Like, they don't have to act scared.  Come after me, Sid.  I'm ready.  Along with Davey Boy.  It's a fucking stormtrooper helmet.  We'll see you at the fall brawl. 
[02:20:30]  The fall brawl.  He's trying to talk about that.  After he just fell.  He looked like a complete idiot.  What?  Should be the fell brawl.  Because he fell.  Oh, very good.  Why is he wearing the mask?  It just fell off.  Can I just say something, though?  Sid Vicious.  He just came back last week.  Yeah, he did.  He's a fucking scary guy.  He is.  Legitimately.  You know, like, he's a legit psychopath.  Yeah.  For indie shows, I've known people that have, like, picked him up at airports. 
[02:21:00]  And he's told them, while they're driving him from the airport, to stop the car.  And he needs to get out.  And he starts, like, doing his wrestling walk on the side of the highway.  As if he's, like, psycho sitting out.  And then he gets back in the car.  And he's like, oh, I just had to get that out.  But let me ask you a question.  I was like, what's he doing?  Why?  Who was on that panel?  We're watching this video.  And after the Shockmaster video, there's a panel.  Like, Mick Foley is on it.  Who are the other guys?  I'd have to look at the panel again real quick.  Probably JR is one of the guys.  Is one of them the guy that was the Shockmaster? 
[02:21:30]  No.  No.  No, they wouldn't have invited him.  Well, has he spoken about it?  Yeah.  He actually, he does conventions now.  And he brings the helmet.  And I've actually seen him wearing the vest.  Oh, so he laughs about it?  I think he'll let you take a picture.  I took a picture with the helmet.  More people online for him than Virgil?  Than Virgil, yeah.  No, he's not online for Virgil.  The worst outfit ever, though.  I mean, it was like a ruffled cape.  A black ruffled cape with a fucking sparkly stormtrooper.  Probably, like, signed him and promised him money. 
[02:22:00]  And then he showed up to work.  And they were like, here's your outfit.  And he goes, what?  Yeah, what?  What do you mean?  And he's fucking not even big, really, or in shape.  No, he's a wreck.  He's not even menacing.  The faces, though, on those guys trying to be all, they're like, uh-oh.  The Shockmaster.  He's got the Shockmaster.  That's a fat pig that just fell on his helmet.  That is Dusty Rhodes.  Today, yeah.  This is them reenacting the Shockmaster to promote the best of WCW DVD.  Who's playing the Shockmaster? 
[02:22:30]  I don't know.  Let's find Mick Foley.  A little fatter than Mick.  Unless he's stuffed, yeah.  I think he's stuffed.  Maybe Santino or something.  Wow, that's fucking funny.  Santino's fucking hilarious.  That's the greatest video ever.  Do you think Vince likes that now?  He loves it, because it was WCW.  Oh, okay.  It was a WWF guy who had gone over to WCW. 
[02:23:00]  So he was loving it.  And then he makes his big debut, and he falls on his face in his Stormtrooper helmet and gets knocked off.  That's probably the most embarrassing wrestling video ever.  It might be.  Although, Booker T accidentally calling Hulk Hogan the N-word is pretty embarrassing.  Oh, yeah.  Have you seen that?  I want to see that.  Can I see that again?  I have never seen that.  It's great.  Is Booker T black it?  Yeah, and he gets carried away.  Hang on.  Okay.  And after we take that Kruger and the giant, we want the gold, sucker.  Hulk Hogan, we coming for you, nigga. 
[02:23:30]  I should point out for the record, Stevie Ray, look at this.  Take a look.  Do you think he realized what he just said?  Yeah.  Look what he did.  His handy.  He was like, ah, shit.  Nigga.  I should point out.  You can see his hand go home.  He's like, oh, shit.  I didn't say that.  And wrestlers love that clip, too.  Like, I don't remember where it was.  I think it was CM Punk, though.  Somebody said, like, and I'm going to be coming for you, like Booker T was coming for Hulk Hogan.  Everybody knows he's talking about the YouTube clothes.  But that's not even that, that's like, the Shockmaster's much worse than that. 
[02:24:00]  What's the one, the Goldust one where he takes, with Rowdy Piper, is that the one where he takes his clothes off?  At WrestleMania.  Oh, yeah.  This is Rowdy Piper and Goldust.  It's fucking uncomfortable.  Yeah, Rowdy Piper, because they're wrestling in a street fight, and they're hitting each other with weapons or whatnot.  And, yeah, the beginning is just awkward, because it's staged like a movie.  Trying to make it like they live, the street fight and they live.  Oh, no.  Hey, Sam, do you ever see the video of Hulk Hogan when he's in the Rocky movie? 
[02:24:30]  Yeah, I've seen it, Chip.  You're not relating to me as a wrestling fan.  I'm a big wrestling fan.  You're not.  I know a lot about it.  You just think we're all talking about it right now.  You mean Thunder Lips?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, you gotta get to, there you go.  Oh, no, that's not it, that's not it either.  That's not it?  What year is that, like 1990?  No, that was like 96.  That late?  Yeah.  There it is right there, there it is.  He's pulling his fucking... 
[02:25:00]  Goldust clothes off?  His clothes off, and he's got women's fucking shocking lingerie.  Women's lingerie under it.  Oh, God.  It's just not coming along with it.  There's kids.  Oh, boy.  There's kids.  Oh.  Yeah, there's kids in the audience.  He's wearing a thong.  Look at the little kids with their hats on.  Oh, look at his ass.  That's hilarious.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, shit.  What a funny, that's a funny gag that a...  He's walking, uh...  Were people shocked?  Yeah.  He's walking out now.  He's, like, naked, except for some little lingerie. 
[02:25:30]  He's going to be Irish music.  Look at that.  That's a big Hawaiian girl back.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  And there's gold paint on his back, too.  Why?  Roddy Piper's just laughing.  I love Piper.  Piper was one of the best.  Was he great?  Ever.  Yeah, yeah.  Fucking great.  Piper's pit?  He was fucking...  Do they have the scene where he really...  He knocked out Superfly with a coconut?  With a coconut?  Yeah, he, like...  He fucking hit some...  He shortened his career.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What do you mean?  He hit... 
[02:26:00]  Like, he had a coconut, and it wasn't a prop coconut, and he hit Superfly in the head  as hard as he could with it.  Why?  Because it was just, like, they were feuding, and he goes, I'm going to hit you with a coconut.  All right, play the sound.  Okay.  It's so funny.  That's probably what fucked him up.  Yeah.  And all the crack.  Yeah, that's true.  Here you go.  Take the little microphone.  There you go.  There you go.  Put it in the little greasy pie.  By the way, if you're ever wondering where Eastside Dave gets half of his dialogue from...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Snooker was a big dude, man. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  There he goes.  A pineapple.  You want to beat a big shot.  You want to do all the talking.  You want to really think all the...  Okay.  We'll be at Anthony.  Anthony.  He's giving him a...  Long, frosty hair on top, brown on the bottom.  Gotcha.  Pineapple.  Pineapple.  You want to be a happy person?  What do you want, huh?  What do you want?  Do you want bananas?  You want to...  He's giving him bananas.  Boy, this is a little racist.  Yeah.  Oh, they can get so racist.  Oh, man.  It didn't matter back then.  Snooker's arms are massive. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah, he was in shape, huh?  He's Eastside Dave.  What do you want?  Do you want coconuts?  Here I went.  I got the coconuts.  Uh-oh.  I just like...  There you go.  Go, coconut.  Go, coconut.  He's dropping the coconuts on the table.  Do you want to call?  Wait a second.  Bananas and coconuts.  You want to be a big child? 
[02:27:30]  You know what?  The only thing I didn't get, I didn't get a tree for you to climb up and down like a monkey.  I called him a monkey.  You want a tree next time.  You want a banana?  Have a banana.  What do you want, man?  You can think.  Am I making fun of you?  Oh, no, sir.  No, sir.  No, sir.  What?  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Dude.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  He cracked the coconut over his head.  It cracked. 
[02:28:00]  He fucked him up.  How do you...  Now he's smushing the banana in his face.  Dude, he fucked him up.  Well, he cracked it against the headband he had on.  That was probably what the gag was supposed to be.  It was probably a cut coconut.  You think?  No.  They talked about it.  They talked about it.  It's a legendary hit.  It's a legendary hit.  He's fucking just hit him in the head with a coconut.  But then he's beating him with a strap.  I mean...  No.  Yeah.  You know, it was like, oh, I'm going to hit you with a coconut.  But Jimmy Snooker didn't think he was going to smash him as hard as he could with it. 
[02:28:30]  Was Snooker really hurt him?  Yeah.  He's really hurt here?  Yeah.  He's fucked up.  Wow.  I met Superfly at a flea market.  He was doing 8x10s and Polaroids for $10.  Yeah.  And I said, can you make it out to Bobby?  He goes, sure thing, brother.  How do you spell that?  Oh, no.  Really?  That's what I got.  I want a picture with him.  B-O-P-B-Y.  He's at all the...  He's easy.  He was at the cellar one night.  Superfly?  Yep.  I didn't know who he was, but there was a guy sitting in the front row...  At the show? 
[02:29:00]  At the comedy cellar.  And his fucking arms were crossed, and he was just kind of...  He looked like he wasn't laughing, but he was just relaxed.  It was fucking...  All you could hear in his head was coconut.  Coconut.  Coconut.  You couldn't, like...  Smashed me in the head.  You couldn't not look at him?  Yeah.  Because, like, I'm like, who is this fucking guy?  He was just this presence.  And then someone later told me, oh, that was Jimmy Snooker.  I'm like, fuck, it was!  I would have fucking jumped off the fucking top table.  Oh, yeah.  Right on his fucking face.  Yeah, so the whole city would have shook him.  Do-do-do-do-do-do.  I didn't mean it.  Mean Jimmy. 
[02:29:30]  Mean Jimmy.  He likes being mean.  They were unapologetically racist in the 80s, though.  Like, I'll put on these tapes and just have mine in the background, and I'll hear something  on commentary.  Like, what?  Like, Junkyard Dog will come out wearing a chain collar and everything.  And, like, whoever the heel commentator is will go, man, this guy wears more chains  than his ancestors.  Oh, shit.  You go, what?  And then there was one clip where Bob Orton was whipping Mr. T with a belt, and Jesse 
[02:30:00]  Ventura's on commentary and just goes, man, this looks like a scene out of Roots 2.  Holy shit.  You could never, never say that now.  No, I think there'd be a problem.  Is that a signed coconut?  Yeah, I remember that.  I'm a big fan of wrestling.  What's the second one?  You don't like wrestling.  I know all about it.  You do not.  You don't know about fucking wrestling.  Fuck you, cocksucker.  I'll put the figure four leg lock like my friend Greg Valentine on your fucking throat.  Oh.  It's not on your throat.  It's on your legs.  It's a leg lock.  With my legs, you piece of fucking garbage. 
[02:30:30]  I love angry chip.  I hope people are so stupid.  It's not just wrestling talk.  We're not talking about the matches and stuff.  We're talking about the history and some of the goofy shit.  Ask the funny shit.  Ask that person what they would like to hear.  Like, what do they want to talk about?  Like, I understand if we're talking about who fucking, you know, won last night.  It doesn't matter.  Let's do real wrestling talk to teach them a lesson.  Yeah, right?  Piper smashing somebody in the face with a real coconut is going to be fun.  No matter what medium it's taking place in. 
[02:31:00]  Don't worry about it.  How did, dude, I think that was, was that not a cracked coconut?  No.  It wasn't a cracked coconut.  It wasn't a cracked coconut.  You've never seen it?  No.  It's not a cracked coconut.  But wait, did Heidi, why did you say that shortened his career?  Because he was all, he was all fucked up after it.  That fucked his brain up?  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Concussed him.  He had concussions from that?  Oh, yeah.  Do you think Roddy Piper felt bad?  No.  No.  Roddy never felt bad.  It's a business.  It's the business we chose.  Well, back then, too, they were fucking, they didn't like each other.  Like, hey, you ever see, you ever see Superfly jump off the top ropes due to Superfly? 
[02:31:30]  Yeah, of course.  Yeah.  Because they did every match.  Oh, just a couple of wrestling fans sucking.  You know what?  That fan was right.  Let's move on.  Chip, we had a good time.  All right.  I'll take a quick break.  Wait, I got more wrestling things I've seen.  I don't think you did, Chip.  What?  You can watch wrestling?  You want anything, Chip?  You didn't hear The Undertaker?  He's good.  Everybody's, yeah.  Hey.  See, this is the type of wrestling talk we want.  Arguably the most famous guy. 
[02:32:00]  Where are you going to be, Jimmy?  Oh, Jimmy.  Where are you going to be?  Just, no real gigs.  August 11th, Horseshoe Casino outside of Indiana with Artie and Nick and David Tell.  I run the Horse Shit Casino.  It's a nickname.  Let me ask you, how is that tour going?  Good.  We've only done a couple of shows.  We're just doing them here and there sporadically because with Nick and Artie, it's hard because  they got fucking radio.  But most importantly, where I'll be is this weekend with my pal.  Who? 
[02:32:30]  Bob Kelly.  I'll be with my one pal and.  Bob Kelly.  And someone else.  Oh.  You're going to be with me, your pal, Bob Kelly.  And Sam, fat, big upper lip, Sam, will be at.  If you don't grow a mustache for this weekend, you're a piece of shit.  No.  What?  They almost said in Fat Sam.  No.  He did.  He almost said fat.  Yeah, he said the word fat.  We'll be at.  No, I was thinking it.  We'll be at.  I just did a fat joke on myself.  UFC.  I can't wait.  Doing interviews.  I can't wait either. 
[02:33:00]  We're going out Thursday night.  We'll have a dinner.  Do you wish we were getting in earlier?  No, Thursday night's good.  We'll chill out.  I mean, we'll hang out, get some dinner.  Are we really going to a tranny bar?  Yes.  Is there a tranny bar?  Yeah.  There has to be.  There's no tranny bar in Vegas.  Oh, maybe there's not.  No.  I mean, I hope so.  You should bring something into the fucking pawn shop out there and see if you can.  You know what?  You can't get in.  There's a line out the door.  It's too popular now.  But I know the publicist for the pawn shop, which she does Empire Comedy, where I'm going 
[02:33:30]  to be in a couple weeks, actually, at the Paris Hotel.  That's a weird fucking how that worked out.  But she might be able to get us over there to go check some stuff out.  What's the Empire Comedy Club?  It's the new comedy club at the Paris Hotel.  Oh, cool.  It's Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  It's really, it reminds me of The Cellar, the way they set it up.  It's cool.  Cool place.  We'll be there fucking doing interviews, and Jim and Reed are going to take us around  and meet the fighters that we want to talk to, and fans.  I want to interview the fans even just as much as the fighters. 
[02:34:00]  You know what's so better this time?  The last time when we went, you loved the sport, but you didn't know.  I didn't know who a lot of the guys were.  But now you fucking know everybody.  I know a different amount of them, and I've talked to enough.  Like Randy Couture, we had just interviewed, and I've kind of picked up a lot the last few  years.  Yeah, you know a lot.  You know a lot more of them than I do, but fucking Rogan knows them a lot more than  everybody.  I don't know that much.  Fucking Rogan.  He'll be there.  Who do you think?  I hope so, yeah.  And he just got his black belt, too.  I know.  What a great video.  Did you see the video online?  No, not that belt. 
[02:34:30]  What's the black belt?  They just showed a video of him, and he gave a little speech.  It was just like a really cool, you know, fucking cool speech, and it was pretty wild  what he said.  I mean, he got a fucking black belt in Brazil.  He said he was a brown belt for seven years.  It was a 10-planet jiu-jitsu, I think it is.  Again, like leveling up.  He's got to keep leveling up.  Fucking crazy.  Now, does he prestige and have to give all his belts back and start back?  Well, they set it up, though, in the video that they don't know who the belt's going  to.  Oh.  So, he didn't even know.  I wonder if he knew. 
[02:35:00]  No, you can see he's shocked.  Oh, would I love to wear that outfit?  What a pussy.  Without looking like the fucking actual killer whale.  Rogan's a pussy.  What?  I just wanted to feel what that felt like saying.  Wow, he's holding a black belt.  I didn't go in there and take it from him.  Jimmy.  Can you say it again and say your name after it, please?  Wow.  Rogan can just beat the shit out of you.  How could he get away with wearing a skin-tight fucking outfit like that?  That's probably what he wears for jiu-jitsu.  Well, that's what you're going to wear in jiu-jitsu.  Yeah.  What are you going to wear? 
[02:35:30]  What are you going to wear?  A fucking t-shirt and jeans?  T-shirt and jeans.  You're going to wear Levi's?  Why?  Are you going to fight and fucking be in that?  When you're out on the street?  What, do you got to change like Superman?  I wouldn't hug nobody.  I would fucking just fifth bump.  You can tell the guys he knows.  Like, he really didn't know him.  He didn't know him.  Eh, not really him.  Yeah, not really.  Nah, he doesn't know him.  Yeah, he knows him.  He knows him.  He gives him a better hug.  He's weeping a little bit.  He's all choked up.  Of course.  Oh, Joe.  Of course.  Jesus Christ.  Fucking pissy-eyed Joe. 
[02:36:00]  Are you out of your mind?  I'll give you something to cry about.  Oh, fuck off.  He's just got his black belt.  You know how hard that is to get?  Not very.  I got one.  I got one, too.  I wear it with a suit.  These guys are in every day in class.  Who is this?  He travels.  Just smells like testosterone in there.  Or a foot.  Look at how thin that mat is.  Jesus, could you have a thinner mat to train on?  It's not even a mat.  No, that mat goes in the ground.  No, it doesn't.  I don't know. 
[02:36:30]  Shut up.  You know what the corner would be like if you hit it then?  Shut up, horse shit.  Oh, fuck you.  Horse shit.  Get to Rogan's part.  I don't like that nickname at all.  I want to be called T-Bone.  They're easier to talk to.  They're easier to hang out with.  Because they're facing reality on a regular basis.  It's something my Taekwondo teacher told me when I was a little kid.  He said, bend over.  Jesus Christ.  Why, Ant?  What's wrong with you, Ant? 
[02:37:00]  I don't know.  Anthony is the one saying it.  Horse shit.  And nothing in my life has ever put me in face with reality better than jujitsu.  Because I think, you know, in life we can all distort our perception of things in order to make ourselves more comfortable.  In order to make ourselves accept where we are.  And there's a lot of people out there that are running around life full of shit.  You can't be full of shit when you do jujitsu.  When you do jujitsu, it's impossible to be full of shit.  Because reality comes at you in the purest form possible. 
[02:37:30]  A life or death...  He is so fucking like...  He could be talking about jujitsu or DMT.  It's the same speech.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He could be reading the back of a Cheez-Its box and I'd be like, oh my God.  The fucking passion he has.  He's a great talker, man.  He really is.  He could be a very good speaker.  He could be a motivational speaker, that motherfucker.  He's really good.  Yeah.  Well, that's true, though.  That's what we were talking about earlier.  Where really tough guys aren't really fucked in the head like that.  Because he would have a little talk like this to you before he just paved your fucking head 
[02:38:00]  in if he needed to.  I just did his...  Paved your head in.  Yeah.  That's such a teenage way of saying beating some...  Paved your fucking head in.  This is what we were kids who used to come up with fucking crazy ways of saying beating  the shit.  I'm going to fucking...  Dude, I'm going to douche you all over the fucking sidewalk.  I'm going to pave your fucking head in.  Yeah.  My mother would always say, Chipper, if you keep jibber-jabbering, I'm going to gravel  your backside.  Gravel your backside?  What does that mean, Chipper?  That means she was going to knock me into the gravel on the drive-roll. 
[02:38:30]  Your mother's an asshole, Chipper.  That kind of makes sense.  Your mother's a fucking cunt-cock sucker.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Fucking piece of shit, whore.  Hey!  Oh, shit.  You going to step in here?  No.  I'll let Chipper roll on this one.  Don't jibber-jabber, Chipper.  I'm going to gravel your backside.  We heard you the first time.  She's a fucking idiot.  Yeah?  Your mother's a fucking bottle of water, cunt.  What does that mean?  Some cunt so big, it's got water bottles in it.  Oh, okay.  Fuck! 
[02:39:00]  You saw a bottle of water on the table.  Fuck you, that bitch, motherfucker.  Yeah, you just saw a bottle of water, and you just said it.  Your mother's a fucking cup of coffee, asshole.  See, he's looking at...  You're looking at stuff on the table.  He's looking at the counter and...  Bullshit.  No, I'm not.  There you are.  You're Kaise Soser in the fucking joke, stupid.  Kaise Soser?  Soser.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Yeah, the coach...  Kaise Soser.  No, no, no.  The coach from the minor league Mexican baseball team that I went and saw last week.  Kaise Soser.  Yeah, was he doing one of the Mina Kulis?  You fucking...  Kaise Soser. 
[02:39:30]  You backwards whole ass.  He's playing words back.  Yeah, he's good.  So, congratulations to Joe.  I saw him, I think, the day after he got it.  No.  And he said they just give it to you.  They don't...  Because I asked him, I'm like, how long was the test for it?  I guess that they just see you enough  And they know that you've achieved it  But it's not a bullshit thing  It's fucking 7 years he was a brown belt man  I think it was 8 years  I think it was longer  I think it was 10 to 15 years  It was 12 years 
[02:40:00]  It was 12 years dude  I wonder if after 5 years  I should have asked him  Do you after 4 years start to go what the fuck  And after 5 years you're like come on  He said in the video  It was really hard for him to get it  He didn't want to give it to him  Just give it to him because he's Joe  He wanted to give it to him and he deserved it  And it took a longer time because he's on the road  He has a lot of shit going on  He couldn't devote himself to go to class all the time  Oh is that his teacher that guy?  That's his teacher  Who is that guy?  Is that Eddie Bravo?  Yeah that's him  Oh I didn't know that was his instructor 
[02:40:30]  He created the rubber god  That's his instructor?  Yeah  I didn't know that  What's the criteria though between brown and black belt  What do you have to do for them to go  Well you made it  Is it like some fucking  Some subjective force like thing  Or is it a mathematical equation?  I think the teacher deems when you're  You know as you learn  Dungeons and Dragons  Come on  Well back in the day with karate  Because I took Kempo  Get out of the day Jerry  Hey  You used to have to go and do the test  Like he said  Yeah 
[02:41:00]  To get your yellow belt  You know  You'd have to do this fucking stupid test  Do kata's  And then run  And then say welcome back to them  Your mother's an asshole  Your mother's a twat  Yeah your mother's a welcome back cotter face  But now  With these guys  They just give you the belt  When you deserve it  Yeah  When you deserve it  Yeah  I didn't  Well you could wipe the floor with everybody  Yeah  Wow  I wonder if he gave me any warning or no  I doubt it  I doubt it  Not if they were videotaping  They probably wanted to catch the real reaction 
[02:41:30]  That's pretty good  Yeah he's not fucking a network television show  Okay now  He has a black belt  But I want to know  What's the difference  Like  Then you have first degree  Second degree  Third degree  Is there  Like obviously there's a difference  But what like  What is it  Like is there any measurable difference  Three degrees  Of separation  That's not what I've done  You're doing words play stuff  I'm going to ask him a real question  Oh sorry Chip  Sorry Chip  I didn't know Chip could get serious 
[02:42:00]  Oh yeah he does that  Of course I do  What do you think I listen to in my car  Double gun  Motherfucker  No but I want  I wish  Shut up  I'm curious  I want to know for this weekend  I hope it kills you like the cat  I'm going to try to get my black belt  Before we go  So I can just have something to talk about  You're going to get your black belt  Before we go to the fights  Yeah  Oh no shit  That'd be convenient  I just got to fucking start training tomorrow  That's convenient  Speaking of training  I got to go to boxing right now  What?
