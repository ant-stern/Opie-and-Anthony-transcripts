<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts' self-deprecating introductions, setting the tone for a show with "very few limits."  They immediately launched into a discussion about the aftermath of a typhoon in the Philippines, contrasting the perceived lack of public concern with the outpouring of sympathy for other affected areas. They speculated on a much higher death toll than initially reported.  The conversation then shifted to Miley Cyrus's provocative EMA performance, focusing on her revealing outfit and alleged on-stage marijuana use, comparing the media's reaction to her behavior with its treatment of similar actions by Snoop Dogg.  Robin Thicke's performance and the attire of his dancers were also mocked.  Eminem's EMA performance with Will Ferrell as Ron Burgundy followed, with commentary on the performance quality and Ferrell's improvisational skills (deemed lacking). The show then veered into a discussion of the JFK assassination, speculating on conspiracy theories and inconsistencies in the official narrative. They briefly mentioned a photo of Progeria Sam at a Bruins game and then transitioned to a segment about a potential ABBA reunion, punctuated by humorous commentary on their 1974 "Waterloo" performance and fashion choices.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to ABBA, featuring extended commentary on their music videos, the band members' appearances (specifically focusing on the women's legs and asses), and speculation on their breakup, with jokes about infidelity and cuckolding.  Listener calls provided trivia about the band, including the palindromic nature of their name and their status as the first Western band on Soviet radio. A metal cover of ABBA was also briefly discussed and played.  This ABBA segment segued into a discussion about Richie Incognito's NFL controversy, playing audio clips of his interviews and debating the context of his offensive language and the media's reaction. Opie shared a personal anecdote about being knocked out for using a racial slur.  Technical difficulties with the phone lines concluded this section.

The following segment delved into a lengthy discussion about the N-word, its usage, and the varying reactions depending on who uses it. A caller, Eric from New Jersey, sparked a debate about the word's racial connotations and perceived hypocrisy in its usage. The hosts and callers debated the context of its use in different situations, including rap music, and the perceived "phony outrage" surrounding it.  They also discussed a lack of historical education regarding slavery. The conversation then moved to a Bryant Park shooting allegedly over a $700 coat, focusing on the shooter's racist Facebook posts and the hosts' reactions to the outrage.  Callers shared their perspectives on race relations and offensive language, highlighting perceived double standards.  The show touched upon broader societal issues like inner-city schools, parenting, and job outsourcing, leading to heated exchanges.  Political figures and policies were also referenced. A listener-submitted, sexually explicit video dating profile for "Lady Di" was played, followed by humorous commentary on the *Rocky* musical and the *Jagged Little Pill* Broadway production, including a comedic exchange about spelling "specificity."

The next segment started with a nonsensical reference to a song and then jumped between various topics. These included jokes about a pregnant woman falling onto dog food; frustration with a malfunctioning sound effect; a lengthy, vulgar discussion about the history of Broadway shows at the Winter Garden Theater (including *Cats*, *Mamma Mia*, and *Beetlemania*), interspersed with dating anecdotes and Long Island culture; crude commentary on a viral video of a homeless veteran's makeover; discussion of a white politician in Houston using deceptive campaign tactics to imply he was Black;  reaction to a proposed California bill mandating protective eyewear for porn stars; a confusing phone call from someone identifying as both Big Al and Miguel; a controversial discussion of racial voting patterns and the election of Barack Obama, using offensive language and stereotypes; and finally, a call from a Rikers Island correction officer reacting to a YouTube video ("I Fought For You") depicting a World War II veteran's reaction to defaced war memorials, with the hosts watching and offering “hokey” commentary. UFC fighter Rashad Evans appeared in studio, discussing his upcoming fight and weight cutting, culminating in a playful exchange of punches with the hosts, followed by discussion of a missed recording of the event.  The show then transitioned to "After Opie and Anthony Live."


The final segment revisited ABBA, sparked by a discussion about Eric's father's musical tastes.  This led to a humorous exploration of the incongruity of a father seriously enjoying ABBA. Listener calls and DJ Dennis Falcone added anecdotes and opinions on ABBA and musical tastes across generations. A caller accused the show of being a rip-off of the Howard Stern Show, and "Lady Di" was mentioned again. The segment compared the Opie and Anthony Show to the Howard Stern Show in terms of guest interactions. The discussion concluded with more commentary on musical tastes, irony, and ABBA, ending with an ad read and sign-off.  The humor largely stemmed from the juxtaposition of Eric's revelation and the hosts' and callers' reactions, along with the show's characteristically vulgar and absurd tangents.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m., an out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Opie, the father.  Oh, this is perfect. This is how it should be.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Hey, hi.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  It's me! I work here!  Glad I got that one out.  Are we on live now? Is it happening? This is it?  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony show,  a popular radio program known for its cream style of entertainment. 
[00:00:30]  And having very few limits.  I like where this is going. I'm seeing a lot of options here.  This is different than any other radio.  No telling what we're going to hear in here today.  Tits, ass, tons of cuss words.  It's not like radio is stuck hanging out.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  This is why. This is American freedom of speech.  It's good on every level.  Insane.  Every second is funny.  Wildly funny.  And philosophically spotless.  Everything you are about to hear is real. 
[00:01:00]  Real people, real excitement.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, we can't handle pot, but show us more dead bodies from the Philippines.  Buddies.  Buddies.  That's all you get is the English.  Yes, you know.  English reporters do all the typhoon stories, so.  Right.  Buddies.  Look at us.  Deluge.  Deluge of water.  People need food and clients. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  That's a horrible situation.  Worst storm ever.  Crazy.  Hitting a really, well, worst place ever.  Have a shitty area.  A lot of corrugated tin.  When you see a lot of corrugated tin in the building, you know there's a problem.  Are we going to have a song, We Are Stronger Than The Storm?  Will Bruce Springsteen get the gang together to help the Philippines people?  The Filipinos?  Yeah.  Will we have some big super concert?  I don't know.  People don't seem to care as much about the Philippines as they do other areas. 
[00:02:00]  Right.  You know?  It's a little too far away for us.  Yeah, we like taking care of...  The Who's not going to get...  No.  They're not going to get a couple songs together for the Filipinos?  We love taking care of Africa.  Do that a lot.  Mexico.  Sure.  Maybe things like that.  Not so much for the Philippines.  India.  India, we're good with that.  We take care of them. 
[00:02:30]  They're throwing the 10,000 number around.  Japan.  10,000 people?  Yeah, I will...  I bet you it's close to 100,000.  Yeah.  They feel comfortable to say, you know, 10,000.  That means it's higher than 10,000.  Yeah, yeah.  Because they never want to go, oh, good news, it was only 5,000.  Yeah, you can't even tell anymore.  They try to boost the numbers in some cases, and then it's less, and then they pad them, and  then it's more...  They were saying, like, 10,000 in one village alone, and I don't know. 
[00:03:00]  I think it's going to be over 100,000 when it's all said and done.  If you have a whole country that's just full of villages, there's a problem.  Yeah.  Corrugated 10 problem.  Yeah, wow.  Oh, yeah.  We also were talking about Miley Cyrus, the EMAs.  I didn't even know that that damn thing was on.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  EMAs.  The European Music Awards.  Yeah, yeah.  And Miley Cyrus, she wore an outfit where there should be hair there.  Was that real, that picture? 
[00:03:30]  I thought that was a fucking Photoshop.  No, she was prancing around on the stage in this, like, this fucking baby jumper.  Fucking baby jumper.  I don't know.  She had a onesie on.  She had a onesie on.  And when she kind of popped her hip to the side, all I'm thinking is, oh, my God, hair  should be right there.  Oh, yeah.  She had a little strip of material covering her camel toe.  Oh, it looked good.  I thought that was a Photoshop.  No, it wasn't at all.  It was the real deal.  And now they're all talking about her again today because she smoked a joint on stage. 
[00:04:00]  I got it on my Twitter, a real good picture.  Did you?  Yeah, if you want to check that out.  Right on.  That's the one.  Right on.  If you could just sort through all the racial discussions.  Oh, my goodness.  See, that's where she popped her hip to the side, and that's what I was thinking.  That's where hair should be.  That should be, right?  God, do I want to lick that?  Do you?  Yeah.  You just want to get in there.  Through the fabric.  Yeah, who doesn't?  And it's got her camel toe right there.  Wow, man. 
[00:04:30]  Oh, yeah.  And then she lit a joint up.  Well, that's going to get the people talking, huh?  Oh, boy.  Someone's got to talk to Miley.  You know, when you do these type of things, it gets people talking.  Is this it?  Here we go.  Oh, yeah.  Is this the American version where they cut it out?  I think so.  Or the European version?  I couldn't fit this award in my bag, but I did find this.  So, thank you guys very much.  Whoa.  She's smoking pot.  She's doing drugs.  And drugs right there.  Everybody, thank you.  EMAs, thank you for having me. 
[00:05:00]  I love you all so much.  Oh, Billy Ray is probably achy, breaky, heartbroken.  I don't know.  There's going to be discussions about this.  Roundtable discussions.  That guy sucks.  Oh, red food.  He stinks.  But for Europe.  Could you get the part where he was talking about making it rain?  And then he got hit with the hose?  It was so uncomfortable.  Oh, that was really bad.  That was really bad.  Is he the party guy?  The party song guy?  Yeah.  He's your guy.  He's come out with a couple of really good songs. 
[00:05:30]  More than a couple.  But, man, he stinks.  Watch this.  It's just fun.  Oh, yeah.  Busy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I got to say it.  This party is popping.  There's so many hot ladies here tonight.  Yeah, of course there are.  Hot ladies.  And you know what we do when the party's cracking off his heart?  What do you do?  We say, make it rain, and we throw a whole bunch of money in the air.  So, EMA 2013, let's make it rain, y'all. 
[00:06:00]  He threw like $20 in the air.  Oh, no.  It's actually raining on him.  Oh, no.  You can't water the flow.  You can't.  Oh.  Can't.  But you know what?  Now is sexy time.  You know what I'm saying?  It's sexy time.  Is he even black?  It gets frizzy when it's wet.  No, he's a little bit.  And now I'm making the ladies wet.  A little bit.  I'm going to finish drying off my hair.  Look at the Euro trash all around him. 
[00:06:30]  Here to cause some damage is the sexy Miley Cyrus.  Wow.  With her massive hit.  Corn ball.  Did you like that?  His music is actually good, but enough with the party and the ladies.  We get it.  It's popping, yo.  It's popping.  The party's great.  Here's the ladies.  It's cracking off.  Cracking off.  Cracking off, yo.  Ladies at the club.  Yeah, he's Barry Gordy's grandson.  Right.  Yeah.  Oh. 
[00:07:00]  Of course.  Yeah.  Yeah, but he's got a few.  Did he write those hits?  Or someone write them for him?  I don't know.  They're good.  Did Mr. Gordy there get some writers for his grandson?  It was just funny to see him last night because he had the big hair and the glasses with no  lens and the space shirts and it was just like saying, everybody look, look, look at  me, look at me.  And then everybody turns around and he just is there.  And it's nothing.  He doesn't have anything.  He doesn't really have anything.  He's not a talented.  Did you see the part where he was talking about how his whole outfit is edible? 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  It wasn't, though.  It didn't look edible at all.  I don't know what he was saying.  I don't know what they were going for.  Getting back to Miley Cyrus.  So they cut most of that out of the American version of the EMA.  Oh, yes.  You can't show anybody smoking marijuana.  But we could show dead bodies from the Philippines.  That's fine.  Just don't show somebody smoking what possibly is a joint.  See, it's everywhere.  Now they're showing it.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:08:00]  She's bad.  And she's smoking a bone.  Man, I don't know.  She should be doing these things.  It gets people talking.  I don't know.  I don't know if you want that much attention.  Oh, it's crazy.  No, you don't want that when you have an album out.  We're going to be talking about how she's out of control and she needs intervention and this and that.  Whoever her PR person is, should have their fucking asshole licked in worship.  Right, brilliant.  Amazing.  Even though it's probably all her.  It really is brilliant.  Fucking brilliant.  She's actually got her act together and she knows what the fuck she's doing.  She's just like, they're talking about me again. 
[00:08:30]  Look at this.  We're the only ones that will say it this way.  Yeah, yeah.  Everyone else is like, oh, but is she out of control?  She need help.  Miley Cyrus out of control will be talking to Dr. Phil about what she needs to do.  Wait till you hear what Miley Cyrus did this time.  And then you've got to wait 28 minutes and 30 seconds and they finally tell you.  Miley Cyrus on the road to self-destruction.  Oh, we'll talk to Dr. Drew about it. 
[00:09:00]  Get all the doctors out there to chat about.  Well, she's obviously in some form of distress and needs an adult to guide her.  We'll talk to Dr. Drew and her lapdog, Jenny Hunt, about the Miley Cyrus situation.  Yes.  Jenny will just nod her head.  Listen, TMZ is the go-to place, right?  How are they handling a very obvious publicity start?  Miley's smoking a joint. 
[00:09:30]  Do you think she's out of control?  By the way, it's funny how she smokes a joint.  All of a sudden, she has a problem.  But if Snoop smokes a joint, everything is as it should be.  That's fine.  That's fine.  Look at Steve Leeds on TMZ.  Why is Steve Leeds on TMZ with Bill Cosby?  Oh, boy.  He just happened to be walking out with Mr. Cosby.  Yeah, with the Cos.  Yeah, see, TMZ.  They're not even covering it.  No, they're lazy, too.  I've always known that.  They got to fucking update their website. 
[00:10:00]  Of course they're going to cover it.  They'll have something on the Miley Cyrus thing.  Maybe they're waiting for their question.  They'll ask a question, right?  Is she out of control?  What do you think?  Do you agree?  Is it a bad message for the children?  What are some of the...  There you go.  Oh, here you go.  Okay, so what are they saying?  Miley Cyrus lights up joint on stage because she can.  All right.  Reefer Madness.  All right.  I mean, they're in Amsterdam, so it is legal, guys. 
[00:10:30]  All right, what does it say there?  Cyrus performed twice during the show without...  Cyrus!  Without...  Without sparking any controversy.  Ah, you get that, right?  Spark it up.  But while accepting the award for best video, she shocked everyone by lighting up.  Did she really shock everyone?  They are calling it a onesie.  Yeah.  By wearing a onesie and a fur coat.  Oof.  God, she's sexy.  She's fucking sexy, man. 
[00:11:00]  I want to date her and just how embarrassed she'd be to have to bring me to these young events.  Oh, God.  My Sabbath shirt all fucking frumpy.  Backstage, giving you a little attention and people looking and going, what?  I see.  What?  What?  What?  I feel a little more comfortable now that her hair is growing in a little bit.  A little bit.  You feel like you're not such a moe.  Right.  I feel a little more comfortable about it.  You're not a creepy moe.  The one side is growing in.  But I think she's keeping the other side a little shaved down still.  Yeah.  And then he's probably going to come in. 
[00:11:30]  But I am so over Ron Burgundy.  I'm done with this.  Yeah.  Was he co-hosting the EMAs?  Well, just popping in with a little laugh and then doing a couple of bits.  Oh, yeah.  But then he's doing the commercials.  And Will Ferrell, who is obviously all over.  I did find this.  So thank you guys very much.  Now, what are they going to say?  Parents must be so proud.  The former Disney star.  The parents must be so proud.  Joined at the stage on MTV's Europe Music Awards in Amsterdam. 
[00:12:00]  They're possibly illegal.  Steve?  I bet your parents are real proud that every one of these reporters.  All right, thank you very much.  Meanwhile, it gets fucking shit-faced.  It is one of the biggest film franchises in Hollywood history.  Every night after they're done.  And just in time for the holiday.  Yeah.  Our parents must be proud.  Parents must be proud.  Yeah, they are.  They probably are.  They probably are.  They probably are.  Why wouldn't they be?  Dummies.  And why don't you guys discuss that maybe she wasn't even smoking pot, you idiots.  Yeah, who knows?  Could have been just a rolled cigarette. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, why wouldn't their parents be proud?  I mean, the idiots on Fox News should understand that people do things for publicity.  It's pot.  She's not booting up some heroin there.  Heron.  Heron up there on stage.  If my parents are proud, hers certainly should be.  Oh, okay.  This is when I tweeted, I'm over Ron Burgundy.  Hold on.  What the fuck is that?  Oh.  It was after Eminem performed brilliantly, by the way.  Yeah, I liked Eminem's performance there.  And even though we made fun of that song when we first heard it, it's fucking catchy as 
[00:13:00]  all hell with the Billy Squire thing.  I kind of like that in the live version.  He's not going up that high with his voice.  No.  I hate that part.  It sounds ridiculous.  And he sang most of it, too.  Yeah.  Or over a track, at least.  Yeah, it was pretty good.  You didn't tell he was performing.  Then he did this thing with Ron Burgundy.  Will Ferrell, obviously one of the funniest, if not the funniest man alive.  But the problem with the Ron Burgundy character is they're spreading him so thin to promote  Anchorman, too. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  And he's an improv guy that he doesn't have enough material to pull it off.  There's not enough yes and people around him.  They should pull him back a little bit.  Of course, yeah.  This is a perfect example.  What happened here, I don't know.  If you find this funny, then I don't know.  I don't know what to tell you.  I'd like to have a laugh on a Monday morning.  All right.  So Eminem, what?  Lifetime Achievement Award type of thing?  Yeah, he got a Global Icon Award.  Global Icon Award. 
[00:14:00]  Artist of the Millennium?  Yeah, which is the how many names do we have to put before award?  To get you to show up.  Right.  Right.  And then Will Ferrell gave it to him after he performed, and this is how it went down  with some amazing improv from Ron Burgundy.  Even in, Ron Burgundy here.  You just received the blue light.  We know who it is.  Ron Burgundy here.  Huge, huge moment. 
[00:14:30]  Anything you'd like to say to your fans out there?  Wow, this is crazy.  Yo, first of all, man, this is nuts.  I just want to say thank you to everybody, man, for everything over the years, man.  All of you.  MTV Europe, thank you.  I love award.  What?  I love award?  I love award.  He's doing the...  No, here's where the improv kicks in, guys.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I love land.  Yeah, I know, I know. 
[00:15:00]  I know where it comes from.  Oh, boy.  You love awards.  I love award.  I love...  I love math.  I love math.  One last question.  I hate to stir it up, but Afro Jack has been talking shit about you.  Anything you want to say?  Who?  Afro Jack?  Who?  That's what I thought.  Thank you. 
[00:15:30]  Thank you, Eminem.  Thank you.  Good night.  Eminem is just kind of like a clown at these things.  He doesn't really care.  No, he doesn't.  Why would he care?  Yeah.  He knows awards are a joke.  Eminem.  Eminem.  Why has Afro Jack been talking shit?  I don't know.  I kind of like that Will Ferrell got out of the horrible improv by just being like,  yeah, this dude's talking shit about you.  He's talking shit about you.  Right.  He's like, I'm tired of this game.  Well, he's smart.  He knows when it's not going right.  So he was able to spin out of it.  And then you got to show Robin Thicke, the broads. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  Holy shit.  They were on stage with just their tits.  Oh, wow.  Really?  Yeah.  It was ridiculous.  Robin Thicke.  I wonder what the rape and violence rate is in fucking Amsterdam compared to here.  Oh.  When they show stuff like that on TV, it's probably so much less there.  Probably nothing, yeah.  Well, I mean, they appreciate the bosom.  Yeah.  But they don't lose their minds because they get to see it a little more. 
[00:16:30]  But please go.  Move that mic over a little that way.  There we go.  Thank you.  So he's on stage doing blurred lines.  Of course.  It's a big hit.  They're not even sure when to go to the...  Is he singing it or is it live?  Nah, it's...  Yeah.  I hear it.  A little bit.  He's singing.  Yeah.  Holy shit. 
[00:17:00]  They're just...  There's nothing...  They have nothing on.  They just have glued rhinestones on their titties.  Ah, fucking nice.  That was pretty hot.  They're spray-painted like silver, right?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  They're just not as uptight up there in Europe as we are in America.  No.  You couldn't do that on the...  Yeah, look.  The American version of the... 
[00:17:30]  Boy, are they lanky.  They're lanky.  He likes a lanky girl up there with him.  Holy shit.  What the fuck is that?  Exactly.  Exactly.  This is going to be one of the best performances ever.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that paris must be proud.  Yeah.  This is the chick with the fat ass. 
[00:18:00]  What's her name again?  I always forget.  She's huge in Europe.  She's massive.  Not here yet, bitch.  Look at the boobies bouncing.  They're just got their tits.  There's nothing on them.  No.  Except some glitter and some paint.  Right.  Some rhinestones, possibly.  Right.  Anyway, so...  Oh, don't turn this off.  No, I mean...  No, I mean...  We're all in.  There's some lovely rumps in this. 
[00:18:30]  Looks like you've lost a couple pounds since the other music awards, by the way.  Yeah.  He's looking a little pudgy in his...  He was, right?  Yes, when he did it with Miley Cyrus.  Now they're doing some kind of a Busby Berkeley above the stage shot there with these chicks.  Spinning around.  Get closer.  A little tight yellow pants that wear spandex.  Is this song getting popular, Sam? 
[00:19:00]  Not yet.  No.  This is the follow-up, right?  No, he has another follow-up that was more popular.  It's a slow song.  Wait, are they wearing spandex?  I don't know.  It might just be the lights.  Oh, it's light.  Okay.  Well, now they put their bras on.  Now they just got their bras on.  They're in good shape.  Yeah.  Some really lovely girls.  I didn't know this was on.  They could say no to Lucky Charms.  Oh, yeah.  Well, your body looks good.  Thank you. 
[00:19:30]  I've lost seven pounds since summer.  Getting there.  Cricket.  Iggy Azalea is the girl.  What?  Azalea.  Iggy Azalea.  Iggy Azalea.  What time was that on here?  Regular?  Seven o'clock.  What time is that in Europe?  I don't know, but I don't know if it was live.  4.30 in the morning.  Oh.  It probably wasn't live.  4.30.  Yeah, it might have been live.  I don't know if I'm actually going to have to be live.  So, Miley Cyrus, the big news.  She smoked a joint and people are losing their fucking minds. 
[00:20:00]  And they think she's out of control, even though she knows exactly what she's doing and  playing into everyone's hands.  It's all over the news today.  And every time you see her, she is going to be chastised by the report.  Of course.  Absolutely.  Can we get, like, a montage of her being chastised today?  Do we have any people?  Yeah, yeah.  Like, to maybe cut some shit together?  You need to get some people.  You need to make some phone calls.  Do it, jewels. 
[00:20:30]  We'll do it on the fly here, too.  We got three.  We got MSNBC, CNN, and Fox on right now.  Mm-hmm.  So.  We got Eagle on the news.  Just sitting there.  Dude, I got a big fucking Eagle.  Looking cool.  I got to tell you, man, I saw Bill Burr at the Beacon Theater on, what night would that  be?  Friday.  Friday night?  Yeah.  Wow.  He bombed?  Holy shit.  He's on another level now.  I know.  Oh, he's funny and all, but he has upped his fucking game. 
[00:21:00]  He is fucking very funny.  I watched his specials on Netflix and whatnot.  His hour that he did at the Beacon Theater was just ridiculous.  Funny guy.  He's on a rocket ship now, man.  And the New York Times wrote about him over the weekend.  Did they?  Yeah.  Big article in the New York Times.  Fucking guy.  Yeah, Billy is...  Fuck him.  Good for him, man.  He's following a similar...  The Louie comparison wasn't crazy, because last year he did Carnegie for the New York 
[00:21:30]  Comedy Festival, which is kind of what Louie did.  He did that, and then he jumped, I guess, one level after that.  So Burr is actually doing the exact same route.  Yeah.  More with movies.  Yeah, but still.  And stuff, but yeah, yeah.  The stand-up is strong, man.  He's great.  Fucking strong.  He's got...  Have you ever heard his bit on ghosts?  Ghosts?  Ghostesses?  Ghostesses?  No, I don't think I heard that.  Was it...  Is there a copy of it?  Because I'm not going to do it justice, obviously. 
[00:22:00]  But if you can find...  Stand up on the console and do it.  Yeah.  If you can find...  Well, Eric, try to find it.  You know, we'll play it going into break.  What he was doing is, he's going to record a new special soon, so that stuff hasn't been  recorded yet.  Oh, I wasn't sure if it was an older bit or not.  Wait, Ghost Hunters.  Is that it?  Ghost Hunters?  It might be.  Oh.  How long is that clip?  A minute.  You watched...  I was watching Carole.  His name is Bill Burr.  These Ghost Hunters?  Who was that?  Did you guys see...  It sounds like Jim.  Wait, who is that?  That's his opener.  Right, that's why...  What the hell is that about? 
[00:22:30]  I don't know.  That's his opener, who I apologize for not knowing your name as we talk about Bill Burr.  Paul Verzi?  Yeah, Paul Verzi.  He was pretty fucking funny, too, man.  Paul Kerzi.  He was really funny.  You believe in Jesus?  You're going to meet him.  Oh.  And then I got to see John Mulroney, right?  Mulroney?  Mulroney.  Mulroney, sorry.  I've been making that mistake all weekend.  John Mulroney.  Where was Mulroney?  He was at Town Hall.  Okay.  He is fucking funny.  He's great, right?  Holy shit. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, Mulroney's great.  He's going to be huge.  Obviously, he's already on his way, but he's going to be huge.  Yeah.  And he goes old school.  He goes up there in a suit.  Yeah.  Like a really nice, tailored, this cost me a fucking fortune suit.  Yeah.  Yeah, I saw him.  Which was weird, because I'm not used to seeing stand-up with a guy wearing a suit.  Old school.  Yeah, he's got this weird...  It's like a throwback, but it's not fake.  It doesn't feel forced.  No way it works for him.  He feels comfortable, and it's kind of who he is.  Exactly.  People can sense that shit when it's so weird. 
[00:23:30]  And he talks differently on stage, but it just feels comfortable, and it feels natural  for him being funny.  Yeah, Mulroney is great, too.  He's going to be huge.  He'll host something.  If he doesn't get a sitcom that stays on, he'll host something.  He's clean, and he's really funny.  Yeah, he's made for a sitcom, right?  He's been on the...  I'm not going to give the bit away, but the bit about the fucking...  Why buy the cow?  Oh, my God.  Is that a brilliant bit?  Hilarious.  Fucking brilliant. 
[00:24:00]  Has he been doing that one for a while?  Yeah, yeah.  I've seen him do it at the cellar.  That's why.  I don't know anything Bill's been doing.  I haven't seen Bill on stage in probably a year since we did the Patrice thing in February.  But John I see once in a while if he stops into the cellar.  Right.  Yeah.  Very good.  So, the New York Comedy Festival is over, I guess, right?  Is it?  I have no clue.  I have no clue.  Not a clue.  Here's my claim to fame in the New York Comedy Festival.  It was Bob Kelly's podcast with Bailey J. 
[00:24:30]  Nice.  Which is coming out on iTunes this week, and the reason I'm promoting it is because a comic  named Luis Gomez, who's funny, sucked a fake dick, a dildo on stage, and it was  so fucking uncomfortable, and the place went ballistic, and I'm sitting there, and I'm  in every photo of it, because it was right in front of me, and he's sucking it as it's  sticking out of Bob's pants, and it was fucking really, really uncomfortable.  Yeah, that's gotta be a little uncomfortable. 
[00:25:00]  Wow.  Oh, boy, is it uncomfortable.  Quite nice reaction from the crowd, though.  It's gonna be a good podcast to listen to.  Yeah, man.  Oh, excuse me.  It was very, very funny.  There was a lot of Kennedy stuff on TV.  Yeah, I saw you tweeting about that.  It was, I guess, you know, 50th anniversary of his assassination.  Well, soon.  Something like that.  22nd, isn't it?  22nd.  Is it?  Yeah, November 22nd.  Yeah, yeah.  We're still 11 days out.  So they were playing a lot of stuff, and they had this one show.  It was pretty cool on, what the hell was it on? 
[00:25:30]  Smithsonian?  One of those great channels.  And it was a bunch of footage, video and film footage from the time, that really doesn't  get seen that often.  A lot of the interviews with the law enforcement and even, you know, where they bring Lee Harvey  out for the fucking perp walk, pretty much.  And they're just chatting with him.  And the thing that amazed me the most was the access the media had to everything back  then. 
[00:26:00]  They, it was like you couldn't shut them out of anywhere.  Like if, if they put a mic in front of you and you were a public official, law enforcement  or, or the criminal himself, you felt compelled to talk to these people.  Like, like, oh, if you don't talk to me, you got something to hide or, it was amazing.  And, and the fact that there is Lee Harvey Oswald professing his innocence and saying how  he wants a lawyer and stuff, like just to, to hear that guy's voice.  If there was a guy that tried to assassinate a president in this day and age, you would 
[00:26:30]  you wouldn't hear a word from him.  You wouldn't get access to him.  You wouldn't, it's, it's amazing.  Uh, what happened back then?  Isn't it weird that he was, he was saying that he was innocent and all, because if you're  going to, you know, kill the president, wouldn't you want the whole world to know your hatred  for the guy?  You'd think, especially right after.  What, he thought he was going to get away with it?  It was this, it was exactly when they got him to, he didn't like later say, I didn't  do this.  He was adamant that he did not fucking do that. 
[00:27:00]  Don't you feel that strange?  Yeah, it's a little odd, but he was an odd guy.  That's what makes me also though, have a problem with conspiracy because if they, if Oswald  was some kind of patsy and there was all these, why would they have allowed him to be taken  into custody?  Like he went, he went home and then came back out.  I think he shot that cop, but the best part about a patsy and stuff is the fact that you,  you discredit him so much previously with, with all, with his life pretty much that when 
[00:27:30]  he does get arrested and says he doesn't do it or whatever story he comes up with, it's  already discredited.  That's why a patsy is always a guy like that.  You want him to get arrested.  You want to put the, the, the period at the end of the sentence.  Why not?  Then why not?  And I'm playing devil's advocate because, because the ability to read somebody, first of all,  he was a very loose cannon.  And second of all, they let him leave.  Why don't you just, if they're going to go through all this trouble, you don't let him  get interrogated by the Dallas police department. 
[00:28:00]  Uh, and I think it was the, uh, the chief of police who was a very good interrogator for  two or three days and then hope that Ruby can get in and shoot him in between two, like  what police department signs up to allow a guy to be murdered between two of their officers?  It is crazy.  And they look like clowns.  Right.  You have him hang himself at home or you, you fucking, you shoot him in the head and  you fake a note.  Yeah.  Fuck Kennedy.  I'm gone.  I don't think he was gone.  I don't think he was going home though, Jimmy.  No, he did go home.  I'm almost positive he went home.  That fucking... 
[00:28:30]  He didn't go home.  I'm almost positive he did go home and then went back out.  Went out to him.  I could be wrong, but I'm almost positive he went home.  Went to the movies?  Oh, you know what?  I thought you meant after he was arrested.  Sorry.  No, no, no.  After he, uh, shot, allegedly shot Kennedy or shot Kennedy.  Yeah, he did.  Okay, right.  Yeah.  And then he shot Tippett.  The, um, when, when you see Ruby downstairs in that, uh, little ramp area that they're bringing,  uh, Oswald out, it's, it's like a movie.  It's like a fucking movie because that, that just shouldn't have happened.  They're talking before it even happened. 
[00:29:00]  The news guy on the spot is talking about security, the security measures that are in  place.  Uh, everyone down here is law enforcement.  They're not letting people, uh, law enforcement or media.  A lot of press down there, giant cameras and whatnot.  And then they bring the armored car, a fucking armored car.  They back it up to the ramp where they're going to put Oswald in here because, as the  reporter says, there are many death threats.  There are people that want to kill this guy.  And then here comes Ruby.  Lot of D just strolls up and shoots him. 
[00:29:30]  It's amazing that that happened.  And it sounds crazy.  Why was he allowed access?  It must have been a setup.  And then you read, and, um, Bugliosi's book breaks it down well.  How he got down there was because he knew the entire Dallas.  He knew them all.  Yeah, cronies.  It's almost like when you see a celebrity out there and everyone's getting shooed away  and I just stand there.  Yeah.  Because I know the people who are, like, the photographers, not the celebrity, but I know  the talent booker.  I don't belong there, but I'm somehow, that's what it was.  They all knew him.  The cops had been down to his club so many times.  They all knew Jack Ruby.  Uh, doing, uh, you know, code, uh, see if there was any code violations and stuff. 
[00:30:00]  And, you know, especially back then, there was probably some stuff, you know, on the arm.  A few drinks.  A few of the ladies.  He's whatever, uh, so they all knew him and he was probably like, Hey man, you mind if  I just hang out and watch him walk down?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cool.  Hey Jack, just stay back there.  It's cool.  And then they're like, Oh my God, Jack just shot the fucking guy.  Didn't John Kerry come out in recent days saying he has his doubts?  He's gay?  Oh, C.I. 
[00:30:30]  He, I think he has his doubts.  Does he?  That Oswald, uh, acted alone.  Well, he's an idiot too.  Was it John Kerry that mentioned that very, very recently?  Yep.  Yeah.  What did it, what did it say?  Because that's pretty interesting.  Because Kerry's been around a real long fucking time.  Is this the clip?  Yeah, he doubts how it worked alone.  How long is the clip?  Six and a half minutes.  That seems like far from the Anderson Cooper.  Yeah, John Kerry's a fucking bore.  There was also that nurse that came out and was saying that another bullet hit him. 
[00:31:00]  You didn't read that?  She was, uh, she was, uh, she was one of the, uh, the, uh, Parkland Memorial, this was yesterday I was reading this, and she said that there was another bullet that hit the president.  It was between the shoulder, the neck and ear somewhere.  Really?  And, uh, that bullet was never entered into evidence, and she is a believer in some sort of conspiracy theory.  So, again, you know, it's hard for me.  Why wouldn't they enter that into evidence?  I don't know.  I mean, that's, this is...  The problem I have with that, though, is when this was all happening, how did they know, all of these people intuitively know, how many bullets were needed to make the conspiracy? 
[00:31:30]  Well, that's true.  This was happening, like, they didn't have the hindsight to look at.  This was live.  So, all of a sudden, they bring in a fucking massacred president, and the operating doctors were like,  Okay, uh, we're gonna have a commission come, and we're gonna have to have three bullets.  Like, who's thinking that way with the fucking skull of a president in front of them?  I don't, that's...  Yeah, I don't know.  It's hard for me to, to, to put that, because it was happening alive, and in that moment, you didn't know what was gonna...  How the fuck, they didn't know that one of the bullets had missed, and, and fucking shot, uh, and hit, uh, oh my god, James Hague. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, by the bridge, right?  That was, that came out after.  They didn't, they didn't call that, uh, person hit with that first bullet, so we need, we, there's only two.  So, we need a third bullet, because Connolly got hit, and you're not gonna find any fragments.  So, let's do all this now, with the, uh, still breathing, but massacred president in front of you.  So, let's do all this now, with the, uh, still breathing, but massacred president in front of you.  So, let's do all this now.  Yeah.  Yeah, Patsy, we got the Patsy.  Patsy, we have a guy who owns a strip club, and who has a drinking problem. 
[00:32:30]  Patsy, he'll murder him between two of your police officers.  Patsy, copy, yeah, we're gonna allow that to happen.  Keep it under your hat.  Patsy, keep it under your hat.  What the fuck are people talking about?  Like, I, I, I understand how it looks fishy, but when you look at it logically, it, it, it's just too much.  And there's too many simpler ways to do things.  Yeah, yeah, that's true.  Too many simpler ways.  They showed, uh, Zapruder, uh, doing an interview with one of the, uh, one of the newsmen in the old news studio.  And, uh, they asked him, you know, what did you see? 
[00:33:00]  And he describes it, um, he knew right away.  He knew right the fuck away that that was it.  It was like, oh, they killed him.  Yeah.  He said, you saw, you know, he, he, he saw the president grab his throat.  He saw that.  And then he said, and his, then his head just came apart.  He goes, the insides of his head just came out.  So he, he fucking knew to have that on video or in film was amazing.  What is John Kerry saying there in that six minute clip?  They got the quote at least.  He's saying that he has serious doubts that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. 
[00:33:30]  And then he says he certainly has doubts that he was motivated by himself.  I'm not sure if anybody else is involved, but I have serious questions about whether they got to the bottom of Lee Harvey Oswald's time and influence from Cuba and Russia.  So he's just saying like, ah, he listened to some shit and was influenced and yeah.  All right.  With his history, Oswald.  And if you're going to use that guy who again had already shot at a public official, why do you let him get taken into custody? 
[00:34:00]  That whole Dallas police department was in on it.  Fuck you.  One of their cops was killed.  Anyone who, what do you think cops back then were different than they are now?  They're people.  So picture any cops, you know, going, hey, this guy murdered the president and he shot a guy in our department.  But let's keep the conspiracy thing going.  You out of your fucking mind?  Well, the if there was a conspiracy, the the the people that put it together probably were using the Dallas police department. 
[00:34:30]  Like I said, you you want it.  You want any good conspiracy.  I think you want it to take some kind of natural course.  Sure.  I don't think you want everything to be choreographed.  Right out.  So you do as much setting up as you can so you could kind of predict what's going to happen aside from things like Ruby.  I mean, I don't know, you know, who the fuck knows what what happened and what was preplanned.  But when you set up a guy like Lee Harvey Oswald to be a communist, to be indecisive and crazy and all that stuff, 
[00:35:00]  you could then just let him go and no matter what he says or does, there's going to be that either element of doubt or it's going to say, well, this figures he's a commie.  So you don't really have to hang him in his house.  You don't have to do it.  He could have been locked up and and to this day be pleading his innocence.  It doesn't matter at that point.  But if he was giving names, it would matter.  Like, you're right to a point.  But if all of a sudden that interrogator and they said the guy was a very tough and smart interrogator, they didn't throw some bum in there with him. 
[00:35:30]  He said, oh, yeah, this is what happened.  It was so and so from this and from that.  And this is the progression and this is who you can talk to.  But none of that stuff happened.  And he could have just said that to the press and people could go, well, all those notes could have been burned, you know.  He was allowed to talk to the fucking press.  One of these stands there and he starts going, there's a guy in the CIA named Bill Bellinger.  And Bill Bellinger said, you're going to take that chance and let this guy talk to the media?  Maybe he was separated from the upper echelon of the conspiracy. 
[00:36:00]  Some lower level guys that if he gave names, they're just some dopey fucking guys that are, you know, as commie as he is.  And, you know, the people that he used to hang around with and hand out literature and shit like that.  Why would he yell that he's innocent?  I don't know.  He probably expected to get away with it.  Yeah, maybe.  Maybe he wasn't one of these death by gun, like, you know, suicide by cop things.  He wanted to get away with it.  But if he was part of a conspiracy, he has to know that there was a chance he was going to get caught.  So why are you yelling, you know, I'm innocent, I'm innocent? 
[00:36:30]  But that's the whole thing.  At that point, you suck it up, right?  Maybe he didn't even know he was part of a conspiracy.  I don't know.  It's one of those things.  And that's been looked at.  Every scenario has been looked at.  And now the whole thing has been watered down because it's been 50 years.  You don't even know what's real and wrong anymore.  Or a lot of stuff you don't know.  Some of the technology with the photos and stuff.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, the longer the time that is, and that's what's kind of convinced me against it,  was all these things that looked convincing.  When computers have examined the photos, you're like, again, I've said it before,  with that thing, Black Dog Man, was like some little figure that looked like it was a figure 
[00:37:00]  in the grass.  You know, is this Black Dog?  He's looking like a Black Dog.  Black Dog Man.  They have all these weird names.  Umbrella Man and fucking Babushka Lady, whatever the fuck she was called.  The worst superheroes ever.  Umbrella Woman.  Didn't we meet her?  No.  Beverly Oliver, her name is.  No.  There was one of those people that were, they just hang out at Dealey Plaza now.  When I went down there with my brothers, I'd have to ask them.  We met a few of those people.  Yeah.  Because they have nothing else to do with their lives.  So every day they go down to Dealey Plaza and hang out and take pictures with everyone 
[00:37:30]  that's going down there checking out the scene.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think she's one of them that used to go down there.  Oh, I never saw her.  But we did it about, I'm trying to think, about...  2004 or 2005, maybe?  Yeah, about eight or nine years ago we did it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So these photos, the one photo of the thing that looks like the outline and the knoll,  like the computers did this thing and they said if that was a real guy, he would have  been two and a half feet tall.  It's so many...  That's a conspiracy right there.  It's just a little guy.  A short little guy.  Why couldn't they get a little midget or something?  A little fella.  Just to really fuck people up. 
[00:38:00]  The tiniest assassin.  His teeny little gun blows him back into the shrubs.  It's horrible.  Speaking of little fellas, did you see our pal Progeria Sam from the HBO documentary at  the Bruins game?  Aw.  Did you see this picture?  His little Bruins jersey on.  He looks even older than he did.  He looks even older than he did in this fucking documentary.  Poor little kid's life is ticking away.  Three in.  Little mayfly.  Yeah, that one. 
[00:38:30]  That's the one.  That is unbelievable.  Did they throw any hits at him?  Put him against the boards?  Little Progeria Sam has a Bruins jersey on and he's taking a picture with Char and somebody  from the Maple Leafs.  He's going to start getting into a brawl in the middle of the ice.  And winning.  Punching him in the head.  Yeah.  When he starts winning, when you find out he's a really dirty little player, he takes  his stick and he's chopping ankles and throats.  Biting crotches.  If he just slipped on the ice and broke every bone in his body.  Oh, he would, too. 
[00:39:00]  They've got to be careful.  Isn't that unbelievable?  Careful.  That kid's 17.  17.  He looks like a little old codger.  Tiny old man.  You can find the picture.  It's online.  I tweeted it over the weekend.  It's everywhere.  Go check it out if you haven't.  He can pretty much go to whatever he wants to.  Hey, I'd like to fucking, you know.  Well, we talked about it.  Check this out.  And he picks a Dave Matthews concert.  What the hell's wrong with him?  Just because you have progeria doesn't mean you have good taste.  Exactly.  But you can pick anybody.  I know. 
[00:39:30]  Go meet the Stones.  What are you doing?  Wasting it on Dave Matthews.  Yeah.  Oh, gee.  Look at that.  Good old Sam up there in Boston.  Look at him.  His little suit.  Progeria Sam.  Still going strong, huh?  Well, he's as strong as you can go.  Yeah, but I mean.  A little progeria.  He might be the longest survivor ever.  What a bitch to have a disease that like 250 people in the whole world have it.  Because no one really.  It's not that urgent.  You know? 
[00:40:00]  You're not like, well, we got to.  Right.  People love saving quantities of people.  Well, if it happens in your family, it's ridiculously urgent.  Well, yeah.  Then it's really urgent.  And you got to be really frustrated that no one listens to you.  Yeah.  Although in this case, they listen to the lady.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because her research.  She has a good story.  Her research could help everybody.  Yeah.  She's really looking into the whole aging thing in general.  Yeah, that's her shoe in there.  If you could say, well, you know, it could help my kid, but hey, it might help humans  as far as aging goes. 
[00:40:30]  Then they're like, all right, let's jump on it.  Remember the other story where the girl never aged?  We just talked about her.  Oh, yeah.  And I think the next day she died.  Yikes.  I think she was 20 years old and she never really aged past the age of, I don't know,  like five or six.  Could she talk at all?  She looked like a five-year-old.  No.  No, man.  She was pretty retarded.  Oh, oh, oh.  As they say.  Yeah, but she wasn't aging physically.  No, she looked like.  It was really, really, really creepy.  She looked like a toddler.  And we were talking about her and then like a day or two later. 
[00:41:00]  That was it.  She died at the age of 20.  Yes.  I think what she had was even rarer than the progeria.  Oh, yeah.  I think they didn't even know what the fuck she had.  Like, at least they could identify this.  They had no clue what the fuck she had.  They had never seen it.  Mm-hmm.  Like one in the world.  Yeah.  You don't want to be that.  You want to be the one in the world person.  No.  Jesus.  Hey, this is Baby McLittletot.  That's good.  Thanks. 
[00:41:30]  That's good, Todd.  Yeah, I'm going to call you and do a prank.  I was at your store and I was gag-gag-gooing.  I don't remember that.  Yeah, and a man came over.  He goes, what do you want?  And I said, my cunt's too small.  Oh.  And we'll be back after these messages.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM. 
[00:42:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The guys are back from the toilet.  Now, back to our show.  Oh.  Oh.  Could be a big ABBA reunion.  We're talking about that.  I was watching them on YouTube last night.  Were you?  A little ABBA?  Yeah, man.  What's the big song they did to 74 on that show that made the monstrous stars wonder something? 
[00:42:30]  What's it?  I think it was a W.  I'm not familiar with their entire catalog.  What are the big hits?  There's a million of them.  Go ahead, E-Rock.  Let's see.  Waterloo, Fernando.  Waterloo.  Waterloo.  This is all happy music.  I'll give you Waterloo.  ABBA plays happy music.  Click.  Ah.  I thought they weren't going to reunite.  I know.  They're chatting about it.  You know why they're chatting?  Because one of the broads from ABBA had a solo record out recently. 
[00:43:00]  Bomber Rooney?  It must have been a Bomber Rooney.  So now she's like, all right, we'll do the reunion thing.  It would sell like crazy.  You know that much?  Yeah.  I mean, you know, if you're into a little ABBA.  368 million records worldwide, I think.  Wow.  Celebrate their 40th anniversary.  Of their first hit, Waterloo.  There they are.  Oh, boy.  Something happened.  She looked okay, though.  She looks all right.  Yeah, they don't look that bad.  Oh, well.  The other one.  The other ABBA doesn't, though. 
[00:43:30]  And Martin Mull.  Martin Mull's in the band.  Very good.  Gee.  Oh, that's the old days.  Oh, boy.  That time is a bitch.  One guy don't look too much fucking worse now than he did back then.  He kind of looked like the guy with the...  Oh, yeah.  With the ring.  He looks like a professor.  The guy up top.  That's funny.  Ah, the blondes.  Ah, what are you going to do?  You know.  Time ticks by.  They were huge.  The outfits they had on.  Can you find the video, Sam, of Waterloo?  It made them a star. 
[00:44:00]  And she's wearing these, like, almost space woman boots.  They had the fucking greatest outfits in 1974.  It's ridiculous, right?  It's time for live performance outfits.  That was the year of, like, the giant fucking spaceman boots.  Yeah.  Big bell bottoms.  Yeah.  And were tucked into the boots.  The knee-high fucking crazy boots.  Yeah, you're coming out of the whole fucking go-go dancer thing.  Waterloo Live.  Do you hear Waterloo Live?  No.  My little sweet on TV. 
[00:44:30]  Ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten.  Live, yeah.  And then put the kisses.  Why are they singing about Waterloo?  I don't know.  A little sign.  That might help.  I don't know.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  I don't need to see the fucking history of Sweden.  A little documentary here.  Oh, yes.  Oh, there they are.  Oh, it's fucking...  But that's how hipsters want to look right now, by the way.  Yes.  They all want to look like fucking steel. 
[00:45:00]  Look at that, like ABBA.  Yeah.  Oh, the other ABBA broad was never hot.  And the blonde was just okay.  Yeah, they were just okay, but...  The blonde was like a six and a half, and the other chick was like a six.  Look at him.  He's a one and a half.  Should be in Spinal Tablet.  Hairdo, man.  Terrible edits of them hiding behind a big giant square bush.  What are they babbling about?  I don't know.  I don't want to see this.  History of...  Oh, there we are.  Oh.  Oh. 
[00:45:30]  I guess it's them with an orchestra?  Uh.  Is that the maestro?  Is this the one or no?  Look at his guitar, yeah?  Oh, man.  She's got, like, a little sexy hat on.  Yes.  It's life.  Yeah, they just kind of stand there and don't move.  Look at her wacky, like, gut and no hips.  She's got a bunt.  Yeah, she does have a bunt. 
[00:46:00]  She's got a little bunt.  The history book from the...  The history book.  The history book.  The history book.  It's almost repeating itself.  There's fucking...  At least the one is trying to dance.  The other one kind of stinks.  I think the one on the right is our doctor.  Look at those fucking pants and fucking Sabbath books.  Look how wacky this is.  She looks like our doctor.  Right?  Yeah.  It's just cute. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, I didn't realize that only the girls sang and the guys played music.  The one guy has, like, a fucking star guitar.  Yeah.  Oh, look at it.  She's got big space boots on.  Yeah, big space boots.  It's bloused up around the top.  It's all very...  All kissed at.  This guy's fucking bass that he rolled his hairdo is atrocious.  The guys sing a little backup, I think.  Oh, okay.  In a certain song.  Do you like this, Sam?  Yeah, that's this one.  Why wouldn't you like this?  It's a little crocheted hat.  I'm sure you'll like this when Jay-Z rips off one of those fucking riffs.  I'm sure.  Then you'll love it.  Yeah, yeah, Waterloo, Waterloo.  Talk about Waterloo, Waterloo, yeah, yeah. 
[00:47:00]  Give me some Waterloo.  I bet you like Billy Squire now that Eminem fucking ripped him off.  I don't even like that Eminem song, but you guys taking the side of ABBA over Jay-Z.  It's just wacky fucking...  Yeah, ABBA had his 40 years.  Let's see Jay-Z sell 368 million records.  You'll see ABBA sampling anyone's music.  That's right.  Yes, yes.  That's right.  Let's see Jay-Z stand there in space boots and sing this delightful number.  They look like the Bay City Rollers meets East Freely or something. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Really, they're all over the place.  She's all permed out, the one she's 24 with a fucking perm.  Why would the guy, the basses, agree to stand down way low like that?  Yeah, he looks like a midget.  He's lucky to be in the band.  Look at him.  He's fucking...  Well, he looks like Gallagher.  Or Doug Henning.  Doug Henning.  Yeah.  Doug Henning.  He's fucking awful.  Every one of these guys looks like they're dead of age because they did unprotected porn.  All male porn.  How terrible is this man's face?  They're all horrible.  And that hairdo is fantastic. 
[00:48:00]  Just a collection of the worst thing humanity has to offer.  Her butt is great.  A shag.  But there was a time they walked down that stage, they looked in the mirror before they  went out and went, God damn, we look good.  I'm fucking working it.  Right.  The blonde is cute though, but she was the main attraction.  She was all right.  Yeah, yeah.  She was all right.  Was this ever cool, not ironically?  This wasn't ironic at all.  There was no irony.  No, this was them being a rock star.  This was the fashion back then.  The blonde's just all right. 
[00:48:30]  That blonde hair could trick you into thinking a girl's hotter.  Absolutely, dude.  It's the most insane thing I've ever heard in my life.  Why?  There wasn't an ounce of irony to this.  Adults would listen and be like, this is great stuff.  Oh, they would absolutely listen.  They would love it.  The blonde might even be hotter.  Like, look at what she, oh, whatever.  She was cute.  You know, cute face, kind of a wacky looking thing.  And it was like around Watergate, so it was like a fucking Vietnam was ending.  It was like a mindless distraction.  Oh, we needed to laugh. 
[00:49:00]  There's a lot of like real shit going on.  That's why this is quite popular.  Just two creepy shining twins.  Happiness and joy.  And there's a little girl running naked with fucking napalm on her.  Smile and have fun and eat an apple.  Fucking Operation Rolling Thunder.  Fucking just blowing up Southeast Asia.  Oh, yeah.  And people just kept listening to them.  Yeah.  They kept putting out songs and people kept being into them.  Really? 
[00:49:30]  They're wearing matching.  Just one, Luke.  That's so stupid.  One more, Luke.  Wearing their.  Oh, here's the Mamma Mia thing.  They're wearing matching blue like satin jackets.  Yeah.  Look at this creep singing in the background.  Look at the guy with the beard.  He looks like the guy with the bassist from the Blues Brothers.  Yeah.  Just one, Luke.  Yeah.  This was that fashion back then. 
[00:50:00]  Little teeny Bob Barker microphones.  Yeah, those microphones are ridiculous.  The choreography's terrific.  You gotta admit that, at least.  They just turn.  They're standing next to each other.  They just turn and look at each other.  That was pretty amazing.  They were in sync there.  There's a comment.  There's another Waterloo live performance where they're just wearing bikini bottoms and like  an oversized t-shirt.  All right.  So what are we waiting for?  Where's that one?  Stop clearing out in there.  Get to it.  What are we waiting for?  That drummer looks like he's really fucking bored.  It's like, what the fuck did I get myself into with these?  Okay, here's the thing. 
[00:50:30]  They had, back now we have fucking 50 little cameras you can run around.  Oh, here's the end.  They had one lunk of a camera.  It was on a fucking, like a tractor trailer wheel pulling it back.  So it was like, just stand there, you cunts, or we're going to lose you.  Yeah, yeah.  They couldn't really move around.  A little head goes to the left.  Get it back on camera.  Fucking neck is showing.  I'll get back.  They had to stand there.  They had eight inches of room to operate.  Looking left and right.  Waterloo.  Left an inch back to the middle.  Oh, my God.  One more nuke.  Big go-go boots and fucking.  Oh. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah, all right.  That looks a lot hotter.  Now we're talking.  I don't see a bunt.  No.  Nice legs.  Yes, very.  Wow.  Ass is hanging.  All right.  She just went up.  She just went up a notch.  She's like.  The history book on the shelf.  History book.  All right.  Goddamn stupid song.  He didn't play a guitar with a scarf around his neck.  Yeah, exactly.  Look at those legs.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  They're looking kind of sexy right there.  Fucking very sexy.  Yeah.  Two guys just standing there. 
[00:51:30]  They are sexing up a little.  Yay.  No Vietnam happening.  It's just fun.  Yeah.  Fuck that.  Yay.  Blue girl, Napalm.  Ignore her.  Ah, the president lied to the whole country.  Whatever.  Look at my legs.  They've got pants on their shirts.  It's way hotter than this one, too.  The blonde.  Yes.  Yeah.  The other one must have been later in their careers or something.  We don't do enough ABBA breaks as far as I'm concerned.  I agree with you, Jimmy.  No, they look really good.  Look, that's the portable cameras she's holding.  She's got a big, giant Polaroid. 
[00:52:00]  Wow, look at her ass in that.  That looks good.  Nobody's worried about Nixon.  They're all just trying to take photos of ABBA.  No, they don't care.  Yeah.  Peace with honor.  Just one giant fucking camera angle.  Don't move.  Don't move, you bitches.  Stand in front of the curtain.  All right, boys, we're going into Cambodia.  But who cares?  Turn up ABBA.  Send out those whores.  Send out those whores.  Make their skirts shorter.  But look at how that bland, awful camera behind them. 
[00:52:30]  Yes.  Just a beige curtain.  A beige curtain.  At least they went to the two-shot, finally.  They had those other idiots in the shot for a while.  But isn't there something kind of cool about the simplicity of this?  Of course.  That was the whole gimmick.  But now there's nothing cool about two chicks in cat shirts singing Waterloo in front of  a beige curtain.  Yeah, but there's something I love about the lack of overdone-ness to it.  Keep your mind closed with your Jay-Z shit.  Yeah. 
[00:53:00]  I'm not the one with a closed mind.  La, la, la, la.  Come on.  What were you saying?  I didn't hear you.  I'm sorry.  Henry.  Henry.  Do a little Jew dance with me to ABBA.  Do a little Jew dance.  This is going to bail us out of Watergate.  No one will pay attention to that awful Judge Sarica.  Sans, do you know what?  In the argument of Jay-Z.  Yay!  Listen to that applause. 
[00:53:30]  Happy Swedish girls.  Yay!  Swedish meatballs.  No one's going to listen to Liddy with that playing.  See, ABBA, badass.  Look, now we've got to get to take our ABBA phone calls.  Fuck yeah, it's about time.  Let's say hi to Trevor in Westchester.  Trevor.  Hey.  Not Westchester.  Yeah.  A very little known fact to most Americans is that ABBA was actually trained by the PLO  and East Germans in how to kidnap offensive and defensive vehicle driving and house assaults. 
[00:54:00]  I mean, they were badasses.  Fuck yeah.  Probably, you know, worried about being abducted.  Yeah.  What else about ABBA?  Let's get this going today.  ABBA facts?  Someone is saying that ABBA did not know English.  No?  You know, the one...  They recorded in English but didn't speak it.  That would make sense.  The one woman who was just interviewed recently speaks broken English still.  Thank you, Trevor.  We're apologizing for her English.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  Can we hear...  They say book. 
[00:54:30]  Did they sing in Swedish?  Ooh.  Do you want to hear them singing in Swedish?  Who doesn't?  Yes!  Get to it!  Because it's ABBA.  Maybe they didn't.  We know them, you know, singing in English.  Let's hear them singing in another language.  First Western band to be allowed to be played on Soviet radio, by the way.  ABBA?  Yeah.  That's what I read.  That's bullshit.  No, I think it was.  They have a Swedish version.  What song is this?  Mr. Herstafirgen. 
[00:55:00]  SOS.  SOS.  Okay.  This sucks.  No, this is delightful.  What's wrong with you?  I really do.  I want to run nude through a field with a long chiffon scarf on.  That would look perfect with this music.  In a summer song playing.  Yes.  Yeah.  I want to frolic out my arms out to run quickly through a field.  Is that what it was?  Were they dating?  It's going to kick in.  They both were married. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  They became both a married couple.  Swingers?  I don't know, but some shit happened that broke the band up.  That's what broke the band up.  They were swingers, right?  Uh-oh.  SOS.  There's some Abba cuckolding going on.  Yeah.  Wow, that's weird.  I've never heard of that before.  The guys started having sex with each other and the chicks were pissed.  Maybe that was it.  Yeah, the blonde would have to lay under and lick the balls of the one man while he fucked  her husband in the ass.  And he pulled his dick out and got shit on her face and eyes and she could no longer 
[00:56:00]  perform.  That's the behind the music for Abba.  It just gets ugly so quick.  Some ass fucking cuckolding and a face full of shit.  Cancel the American tour.  Why don't the broads just get together, call themselves Abba, and forget the guys?  They could do that.  How are you going to do it without the starburst guitar?  That's true.  That's why you have the mullet.  More facts about Abba coming in.  Please.  Let's say hi to Larry in Houston.  Larry.  Yeah, hey.  You're going to find your dog dead in the hallway, Larry. 
[00:56:30]  Your mother, Larry.  A little, little fact.  What?  About Abba.  Yeah.  It's spelled the same.  Forward and backward.  Damn, I did not know that.  I did not know that.  That's true.  That's a fun fact.  Thank you.  Let's go to Max in Massachusetts.  Max.  Yeah.  Abba stole from the Supremes, guys.  Listen to Baby Love by the Supremes.  It sounds just like Waterloo.  True.  Baby Love.  My Baby Love. 
[00:57:00]  Waterloo.  That's good.  That's good.  Dun, dun, dun, dun.  Okay.  Yeah, maybe a little.  I got Fernando in Swedish here.  Well, Fernando.  Their big one, of course.  Dancing Queen.  Yeah, let's hear Dancing Queen in Swedish.  Let's get a live in Swedish.  Because I want to see him dance around in little skirts again.  Absolutely.  I said in Swedish.  We need a video.  Come on, Iraq.  Stop playing the fucking soundtrack of my life.  I want Closet Queen. 
[00:57:30]  I'm crying.  Dancing Queen.  Dancing Queen.  This is very exciting.  Oh, man.  Look at that line.  They're rocking.  Just an A.  Two A's and two B's.  Where are the girls?  I'll tell you what people loved about this.  The symmetry.  Two guys, two girls, two A's, two B's.  Two A's, two B's.  All right.  Where are the ladies?  Where are the bitches? 
[00:58:00]  They're changing outfits, you queer.  Oh, man.  They better come out and...  Oh, here they come out.  Wait, wait.  All right.  Let me stay.  Where are the real stars?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Right like I'm wearing spandex.  When I was in medical school.  All right.  With the intro.  Holy shit.  That's a little big one.  They're waving.  This is a huge song for the opera.  Yeah.  All the ladies are coming out.  Yeah.  Get the two cucks out there with the musical instruments.  And they love them.  Look at that.  Oh, she's wearing a little headband. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, they're all happy.  Take your time, Axl.  Yeah, they're dressed like fucking Jenny Gump before she got aged.  Oh, here we go.  The headscarves.  I do like the legs on that blonde.  Who doesn't?  Can you imagine waiting for this?  Yes.  Yay.  Oh, jeez.  That's a small child dancing.  Uncle Paul likes that.  What are those people there to see? 
[00:59:00]  Dancing and having fun.  This is right.  What do you know about fun?  Abba was quite huge.  Wow.  Two A's, two B's, two girls, two guys.  That's what I want.  Symmetry.  I never realized how attracted I was to the Abba girl.  The blonde?  Yeah, she's got like a nice ass and legs on her in these little get-ups.  By the way, fun fact about Abba.  Yeah.  She said that her favorite song when asked, I don't remember the name of it, but it was  a song about them being divorced and they played, because the band stayed together after 
[00:59:30]  the first divorce, and she said it was good to get that pain out there every night in  front of the audience.  Yook.  Yes.  Fun Abba fact.  She's wearing a fucking Rota hat.  That's it, yes.  It's a Rota hat.  Hopefully there's not anything in that hat just didn't work out well for Rota.  Look at the dancing beast.  These moms are just drinking.  The kids are like seven and already know this is not cool.  Oh, they love it.  No, these were real hair dudes back then, dude.  Now they're ironic and hipsterish, but back then they were the real deal. 
[01:00:00]  I do like that they perform without pants on.  This is the shit that makes us cool, Sam.  Yep.  Fuck yeah.  Because we're not embarrassed to say that, you know, it's not cool at all.  This is so cool.  No, it's not.  You're not brave enough to admit how cool this is.  Look at that.  Two A's.  Thus then you're not cool.  Two A's, two B's.  Two A's, two B's, two guys, two girls.  Symmetry.  No lip syncing here.  No, and the B's are facing away from each other.  Everything's a mirror image. 
[01:00:30]  Don't forget the two divorces.  Two divorces.  That's right.  Two tits, two balls.  That's right.  What a bitch it was to haul a camera to these events.  See everybody pulling these big bulky cameras out.  Yeah.  And you know they were taking a picture and it looked like they were 20 miles away.  Oh, awful.  You get the fucking arm of the person in front of you with lights in the back, allegedly  or an Abba.  Oh, boy.  And then like 20 years later, you have a photo album full of bad pictures of Abba.  That's right.  She's just like the goddess Athena.  Hold on, guys.  There's more facts coming in. 
[01:01:00]  All right.  All right.  Good.  Let's say hi to John in Jersey.  John.  That's bad.  Hi, Chad.  Hey, John.  The one thing that a lot of people don't know is they only did one North American tour in  their entire career.  What?  Wow.  Those people were really lucky.  A lot of people don't know that.  They were really lucky.  Why did they deny us?  Because they sucked.  And unlike Black Sabbath, it was my first concert.  Oh.  Radio City Music Hall.  There you go, brother.  Radio City.  Wear that proud, John.  Wear that proud. 
[01:01:30]  And they play without pants on.  That's pretty good.  That's the one thing I like.  That is good, right?  We got more facts coming in.  Let's say hi to Sean in New Hampshire.  Sean.  Hi, boys.  How you doing?  All right.  We're discussing Abba today.  Getting your Abba facts.  That's right.  I know.  The blonde chicken Abba had a big hit in the 80s.  What was it?  I can't remember the name of the stupid one.  Good one. 
[01:02:00]  Sounds huge.  Good one.  Well, how is it a big hit if you don't know the name of it?  You can look it up.  Does anyone know the big hit?  The blonde from Abba had a big hit?  That was very coy the way you said that.  Yeah.  You can look it up.  You can look it up.  That was like pillow talk fun.  That should do that.  Me, me, me, me, me.  This guy's going bald already.  All right.  Let you know.  I bet the guys were writing all the music, and the women just got so cunty because they  were the big stars of the band.  I bet you're right.  It is right.  Yeah.  The two guys own all the writing for that song.  Not for that group.  But the chicks were like, you guys get up on stage and wait for us to be ready. 
[01:02:30]  And wiggle your fucking asses.  We'll be at the front of the stage.  You guys just stay behind us.  Write the music.  Wear this ridiculous fucking outfit.  It makes us laugh.  They didn't know anything about royalties, right?  How they were going to get fucking fucked somebody.  Go out there, play guitar, play drums, play drums.  What is this?  Her ass looks big.  Oh, her ass is shitty.  What is this?  This is the 80s hit.  This is Chiquita.  Is this her big 80s hit?  No, this is Abbott's, though. 
[01:03:00]  Did he snow?  Is that fucking, it sounded almost like fucking Don't Cry For The Argentina, no?  No, probably not.  No.  What's the 80s song she did?  This is definitely later.  We know 80s music.  There's no way she had a hit in the 80s.  I don't remember no ABBA blonde girl hit.  She might not have recognized her name solo.  Yeah.  She might have had a hit and you're like, oh, that's her.  Did she do 99 Luff Balloons?  And now from ABBA.  He'd have done something like that.  Chiquita.  It's Chiquita.  No, that's a.  Oh, come on. 
[01:03:30]  ABBA was lovely.  What's the 80s song?  They were, Sam.  Suck.  Oh, stop being so hardcore.  What's her name?  The 80s song was called Something Going On.  Is that?  Agnetha Faustam.  Agnetha.  Agnetha.  Put something going on in the search.  That's a sexy name, isn't it?  Agnetha?  Oh, Agnetha.  I like that.  You're so hot, Agnetha.  Sounds like Amon Gert's mistress.  All right, here we go.  Amon Gert's. 
[01:04:00]  Here's the 80s hit.  All right.  Frida?  She's Frida?  What's it?  Let me see.  Yeah, he's like, no.  The redhead is Frida.  What?  All right, but it's one of the ABBA broads.  That's right.  Wait, Frida is ABBA?  Here they come.  Frida's such out of here.  I know there's something going on.  This was a Hugh song.  This was the ABBA girl?  I swear I never knew this.  I didn't know that.  Yeah, I told you it would be in some of the name we didn't recognize. 
[01:04:30]  I'm smart.  This isn't lip synced either, is it?  No, this is.  She doesn't have a microphone.  She's just standing there, belting it out.  Oh, no, she does.  No, it's completely lip synced.  This is a lip synced.  Did you know this?  No.  No.  I did not know that Frida...  Worst lip syncing ever.  I believe Phil Collins is drumming, too.  I believe.  Oh, Jesus.  What's she doing?  She looks like Gloria Loring there. 
[01:05:00]  She looks like, actually, the neighbor in fucking...  Bless you.  I can't remember now.  She was in ABBA children.  Marcy Darcy?  Yeah, yeah.  She looks like Marcy Darcy.  She was in ABBA for all those years and never learned how to dance.  No.  She's me too.  Terrible.  For our Swedish friends, someone should be translating this, because the words are on the screen.  All right.  Who wants to give it a shot?  Ah, this is all for me.  I'm sick, dog, little.  I'm sick, dog, little. 
[01:05:30]  Nice.  I've got to know the girl.  Better.  Yeah, this sucks.  Wow, her outfit is atrocious.  Yeah, that is terrible.  Now she's hiding a world of hurt.  She looks like Maude.  Young Maude, right?  Maude.  Oh, that's horrible.  All right, the blonde had a song, too, called Winter Takes It All.  I think I remember.  That's the fucking ABBA.  Yeah, but the Frida's the ABBA, too.  Winter Takes It All, I think, is ABBA. 
[01:06:00]  So.  Bob, Bob, Bob.  Man, she had a massive hit with that Frida thing.  I didn't know that was her.  But then that was it, I think.  What?  I remember this song, too.  I don't like those dots over the A. It creeps me out.  Oh, I know.  It always looks like a...  False gug.  Yeah.  L-T-S-G in a row and a name is wrong.  Two dots over a name, and Jews get nervous.  Yeah, it's terrible.  Yeah.  Yeah, this is ABBA.  No, it's just her and her husband.  Because maybe they were still together, and they said, fuck the other couple.  Why can't they have love?  And the woman.  Wait. 
[01:06:30]  And it's the other girl back.  And the other guy.  It's ABBA.  Come on.  Well, let's see if the blonde's there.  Yeah.  I don't want to talk.  Oh, she doesn't want to talk.  What the fuck?  Things we've gone through.  Who cares?  I wonder if this is the song that she loves is her favorite.  It probably is.  Yeah.  It's a terrible song.  Oh, it's a race song.  Now it's history.  It hasn't kicked in yet.  Oh. 
[01:07:00]  This sounds like fucking every song in the Emanuel movies.  I could jerk off to this.  This sounds like the 1977, like Sylvia Christelle's big tits are falling out.  She's on a moped in Vietnam.  Well, the winner takes it all.  The loser's standing small.  It's not a bad song.  Yes, it is.  It's lovely.  Listen to her angelic voice.  Right?  Yeah.  She's got pants on.  Yeah, she is wearing pants.  They're updating.  This is the Mary Callum War outfit.  77, maybe? 
[01:07:30]  78?  Which guy did her wrong, you think?  Which guy did her wrong?  She's got the Farrah Fawcett sweep of the hair.  Absolutely.  You know, all brushed back.  Exactly.  Very good.  Hopefully not the other fucking...  Oh, no.  Hopefully that's where it begins and ends the Farrah Fawcett comparisons.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  All right, enough of that.  That was lovely.  Let's get another fact from Ron in Maryland.  Ron.  I like the way they put her name all big in the fucking video.  Yeah, just letting you know who the star is.  Ron, you're the last one with the Abba thing. 
[01:08:00]  Hey, I was listening on Spotify.  I found this cover band for Abba called Thank You For The Music.  They basically cover every Abba song out there, but they do it to metal.  All right, let's hear this.  Thank you for the music.  You're for the turkey.  Well, thank you for the music.  All right.  What a dumb name.  All right.  Is that a song by Abba or no?  I don't know.  Probably is.  What's our choices?  It's not Abba.  It's a whole bunch of bands.  All right.  Okay, sir.  Don't you know.  Oh, there's a whole bunch of bands.  But there's a song called Thank You For The Music.  Well, that's what I was asking. 
[01:08:30]  I know.  Well, that's...  But what other songs are on the album from these metal bands?  All of them.  Dancing Queen.  All right.  But we're trying to find it ourselves here.  Yeah.  Well, let's see.  With Sam Roberts at the Google.  It's terrible.  No, it's not.  Abba Metal.  Let's try this.  Thank you, sir.  This is Waterloo again.  Yeah.  Jesus.  It's Panda Fowl.  I don't know that everyone's familiar with it.  Yeah.  Panda Fowl.  Kill a Jew!  Kill a Jew!  Fucking fake racist. 
[01:09:00]  It still sucks.  Because you missed the original mirth and joy of the Abba.  It doesn't have symmetry.  Yeah.  Two B's, two guys, two girls, and two A's.  Get to it.  It's not very metal-y.  No.  It's just a pop version with the guys singing. 
[01:09:30]  What other ones you got?  That's crazy.  Here's one.  It's Waterloo.  Sounds like shit.  Well, I've got no choice.  Yeah.  All the girls and boys.  That's what that is.  This is school now, right?  Very much so.  Maybe Waterloo's out.  Yeah.  Here we go. 
[01:10:00]  Fuck yeah.  Woo!  Woo!  This guy's rocking now.  Here it comes.  Chorus.  Chorus.  You digging it?  No.  Waterloo!  Abba should just be forgotten about.  Don't try anything with it.  Done.  168 million records. 
[01:10:30]  You're going to eat your words when Jay-Z does something with that shit.  Yeah.  Maybe he'll make it good.  I don't know.  He won't.  Waterloo.  It's already good.  Yeah, yeah, the dancing queen.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  And then he'll have that angelic voice.  It's already good.  And then he'll be tricked into thinking Jay-Z's fucking brilliant.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Ha, ha, ha.  These idiots.  What?  Why?  They didn't make much of that.  Nongong.  Den handlar om ett mycket brön. 
[01:11:00]  What?  It's not even a language.  Leave your possessions here.  Ha, ha, ha.  Oh, I thought I just had a stroke.  That wasn't English, right?  Thank God.  We already watched this.  Oh, there's her dancing.  I just can't get enough of that fucking.  Her dancing with those boots.  The legs and the boots.  Ah, the boots.  The go-go boots.  Yeah.  I would take those boots off.  They'd be all sweaty.  Yeah.  And then I'd take her panties off and they'd be all sweaty.  Would you leave the cat shirt on?  Yeah, for a little while.  I'd leave the boots off.  I'd want to see those big fucking Nordic sweaty tits. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  Jesus.  You know what?  I'd like to fucking eat her ass in the boots.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Make her wear a performing boots.  That'd be great.  Hopefully she didn't have a horrible cheese odor to her feet.  That was the curse of ABBA.  It's on the tour bus.  She had to hang her feet out the window.  Because the boots made them smell like Munster and Gouda cheese.  Munster, yes.  They would all tease her behind the scenes.  Oh, cheese feet is ready.  Cheese feet is ready to sing.  Why did we play ABBA? 
[01:12:00]  ABBA.  Because we're queers in a huge, huge mistake.  I don't think it was at all.  Iraq played it.  Why?  Why did you play with Iraq?  Iraq, why are you playing?  Because they might be reuniting.  Oh, okay.  Absolutely.  They sang in German, Spanish, and American.  All right, now we've got to hear them in German.  Oh, that's going to sound very...  We've got to hear them in German.  Jews, relax.  Thank you, Chuck.  All Jews, relax.  It's okay.  This is going to sound fucking weird.  And are they probably singing a different place than Waterloo?  I hope it sounds like Rammstein.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is this Waterloo? 
[01:12:30]  No, it's Fernando.  Fernando.  Yeah.  Waterloo.  Wow.  Oh, boy.  Looked like Teletubbies.  Yeah.  Dressed like Teletubbies.  All right.  Simpler times.  She looks like Amy Schumer there, the one, doesn't she?  Yeah, she does.  Yes.  Oh.  The crackling of the record rules. 
[01:13:00]  Ooh, they luzz out.  Oh, man.  They're just gently holding each other.  Oh.  Yay!  Ew.  Kid's got the same hairdo as his dumb dad.  Yeah.  Fucking.  Put that kid on a paint can.  A little Dutch boy.  This is dangerous.  There was something in...  No.  They're showing, like, photos of their lives.  Drinking a little vino. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  We're all hooking up with each other.  Hanging out by the docks.  All friends.  Laughter.  I see boats down there.  Yeah.  And then there's the bassist who's not in the...  He's molesting the dog.  He will be too much inside.  He's released to be able to love him on me.  My con bison.  Chicken is good.  This reminds me of, like, the Coke commercial.  Oh.  Happier times as a boy.  Oh, that's right.  This stuff makes you sad.  Yeah.  Oh, it does.  Because it's gone.  It's gone.  I'd like to teach the world to sing. 
[01:14:00]  That one.  So that shot of them enjoying a glass of wine, looking at each other across a table, that's  got to really bother you.  No, it's not so big.  I was alive during that.  That one.  You remember that?  Yeah.  A lot of these people are dead in this commercial.  I would hope so.  Oh, my God.  Oh, boy.  Look, a black guy.  Yeah, you don't like that, huh?  Yeah.  Oh, an Indian guy, an Asian.  Oh, a lot of white people.  What a genius marketing.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah, but they all have diabetes, though.  Probably, yeah.  Don't be literal.  Spoiler.  Oh, shit.  Look at all those nice white faces.  Bunch of hippies.  I told you, when Jason Rosenberg would sing, Mrs. Jones was our music teacher, and we would  sing harmony, let's all live in harmony, but Jason Rosenberg would sing dog duty instead  of harmony. 
[01:15:00]  Dog duty.  And, dude, it was the funniest and greatest thing.  He shoehorned in duty.  Dog duty.  Dog duty.  Suggesting people live in dog duty.  Instead of harmony, he timed out dog duty.  Dog duty.  I can't do it.  It's, that probably, I was probably at 10 when that happened, and I can still laugh  at that once a week.  Still hilarious.  Still hilarious.  Yeah.  Oh, Mrs. Jones.  Well, there you have it.  Our tribute to Avon.  Yes.  Why not, right?  Maybe reuniting. 
[01:15:30]  That means they are reuniting.  The contract isn't signed yet.  You're going to go, Sam?  No.  What?  Gaga's new album comes out.  Who?  Today.  Who?  Lady Gaga.  Gaga wants to go into space.  That's right.  And do a concert.  There you go.  Now we're talking about some contemporary.  Lady Gaga is like, that's just ABBA.  For nowadays.  It is.  What are you talking about?  Modern ABBA.  It's just modern pop shit.  At least it's nowadays.  There's nothing special with her.  She just writes a good pop song.  When it was those-a-days. 
[01:16:00]  Those-a-days were nowadays.  But it's not those-a-days.  That's the whole crux of the discussion.  No, but at some point it was those-a-days.  Right.  Was nowadays.  Nowadays now is going to be those-a-days.  In them-a-days.  That could be the baddest fucking wheelchair I've ever seen in my life.  Tank wheels.  He's got tank wheels on the side of his wheelchair.  Or tracks.  Tank wheels.  Tank wheels.  Tank tracks.  Sorry.  You guys are hilarious.  Tank wheels.  What do they even do for you?  Sergeant Chris Jones. 
[01:16:30]  Of course, today is Veterans Day.  Yes.  Freedom.  A big what's up to the veterans.  Yes.  But that is a bad-ass wheelchair.  This chair just treads through everything.  How cool is it?  I mean, you guys are-  Dog shit.  He goes, how cool is it?  He starts to-  I go, well, I'd rather be able to walk, you dummy.  Yeah.  Imagine that in your rug with dog shit and fucking-  Fucking gunk from the water.  You think it would, yeah, grind into the carpet?  I challenge every fire department, police department across the states to go across it.  And I'd like to thank Richard Libner for getting me my chair. 
[01:17:00]  Holy shit, that's badass.  He's actually the sponsor of my chair and the Independence Fund.  That's great.  They're amazing.  Yeah, and Jennifer Griffin and Bill O'Reilly doing a lot of great things.  And, of course, you're here.  Yeah, I guess it was the 238th birthday of the Marine Corps.  The Marines, yeah.  Hurrah.  Well, we're going to take a break.  Tom Popp is coming in.  And also, we had a shooting a mere few blocks from here over the weekend.  Was it a mere few blocks?  A mere few blocks.  I believe five.  Right by the HBO office there at Brian Park. 
[01:17:30]  What?  Brian Park.  Yeah, Brian Park.  Which is a-  That park rules.  For people that are coming to New York, fuck the Times Square shit.  Oh, boy.  Because of all those comedy shows.  I was wandering around Times Square a lot Friday and Saturday.  And these people just are just dummies in Times Square.  It sucks.  Go somewhere else.  So much to see in New York.  And a mere couple blocks over is Brian Park, which is a much cooler place to check out.  I wasn't aware at all that there were so many young black guys ice skating. 
[01:18:00]  Who knew that was going on?  What the hell?  Was there a lot of black people ice skating?  Well, yeah.  Apparently.  Really?  Yeah.  And that's, you know, there's shooting going on and a little trying to, a little, some  guy trying to rob someone of their coat and a couple of bystanders get shot.  Yeah, we got to the story next.  And Tom Pop in a little bit.  But first, we got to do this.  Oh.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:18:30]  The Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Continues.  Hi, Tom.  Y-Rock's just loving ABBA today, huh?  Now you have a reason to wear those beats, by the way, Sam Roberts.  To enjoy.  Enjoy.  The real music.  The beats were made for ABBA.  Absolutely.  Or ABBA.  No, they weren't. 
[01:19:00]  I'll give you ABBA.  Wow, Y-Rock really likes the fucking music.  It's cranking.  Really fucking loud.  So, yeah.  Could we play something from this millennium?  Well, no.  So, I feel like, I mean, 13 years of coverage.  That's not asking too much, is it?  Yeah.  Richie Incognito saying, I'm not a racist.  Yeah, it's never a good thing to have to say.  I think he's going to, for some reason, though, it's been going on long enough where they haven't 
[01:19:30]  just booted him.  Oh, no, he's going to be playing again.  I think he'll play again.  I think he should be after the more you hear about it.  I think he's got a case against people that were telling him, hey, toughen that kid off.  Absolutely.  It's the locker room culture.  We've got to make sure that doesn't happen anymore.  That text, by the way, came over the weekend.  Jonathan Martin sent him a text right after that.  She goes, nah, it's just the culture in the locker room is getting to me a little bit.  We're good, man.  This guy's just being a baby, I think.  Wah.  I think Cognito takes it a little further than most people, probably NFL culture and 
[01:20:00]  all that shit going on in the locker room.  Thomas stick his head in gravy, right?  Then you take some bubble gum, you make sure it's cleaned.  Then you get a shipping kind of company, and you send it to some branch of the military  that usually involves ships or whatnot.  What's that?  Yeah.  The Navy?  Could be the Navy.  Okay.  Sure, sure.  Just what you do with a baby.  Oh.  Yeah.  Well, Incognito talked over the weekend. 
[01:20:30]  Oh!  We got a couple clips.  He's a little braver than most.  Is he?  Yes.  I like that.  Most people, if they were in the situation he was in, you know, they'd be...  Excuse the racism.  You get a lot of hum-na-hum-na-hum-na-head-notting.  Not so much.  He's a little braver than we've seen in the past.  Past episodes of this type of thing.  I like seeing Whitey stand up.  You can ask anybody in the Miami Dolphins locker room who had John Martin's back the  absolute most, and they'll undoubtedly tell you me. 
[01:21:00]  John never showed signs that football was getting to him, the locker room was getting  to him.  You're saying you don't know what led to this.  Your teammates are saying we don't know.  His side has clearly said we do know.  Okay?  And there's bullying involved.  There was a voice message left.  I'm going to read it to you.  You did leave this voice message.  Yes, I did leave this voice message.  And it's, hey, what's up?  You half N-word.  Can I ask you a question?  I saw you on Twitter. 
[01:21:30]  Who's interviewed?  I'm sorry.  It's NFL Sunday.  I forget the guy's name.  You've seen him a million fucking times.  N-word.  But you see how they're handling the racial language?  You said bigger.  It'll have N-word.  Yeah.  Can you say it on network?  It's on Fox.  No, probably not.  But I'm just saying, look at the delicate.  Look at how they're harping on that.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  I think it makes it worse by saying N-word.  It does.  It's just N-word.  What are we fucking children?  Say it or don't.  It's infuriating.  We're like little babies.  It really is.  I thought by N-word.  N-word. 
[01:22:00]  Especially in a news story.  Fucking say it.  That's the N-word.  Don't say it.  If it's part of the news story, then don't do the story at all.  Right.  Right?  It's part of the story.  You use the fucking word.  I think so.  Say the fucking word.  Hey, what's up?  You half N-word piece of black.  I saw you on Twitter.  You've been training 10 weeks.  I want a blank in your mouth.  I'm going to slap your blank mouth.  Going to slap your real mother across the face.  Laughter.  You're still a rookie. 
[01:22:30]  I will kill you.  That's hilarious.  What's the problem?  How many fucking texts are sent like that to people you know?  If you didn't know the person, that could be a little iffy.  But you don't know what context that's in.  If he's goofing around and shit like that.  And yeah, it's brutal.  But that's how people fucking chat with each other.  And what's important to the story, they texted each other at least a thousand times in the past year alone.  Of course.  They had a back and forth thing going.  It wasn't one and done.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:23:00]  You hear that.  Going back to that now, do you look at that and say, I left that for Jonathan Martin?  When I see that voicemail, when I see those words come up across the screen, I'm embarrassed by it.  I'm embarrassed by it.  See, this is where we've got to go.  It's the fake.  He's lying.  He's lying.  I understand why, because he's got a lot of money at stake and he wants to get back to playing football.  But he's lying.  Be like, yeah, we goof with each other.  Yeah, he has no problem texting that word and thought it was completely acceptable. 
[01:23:30]  But now that society has taken a closer look, now he's got to say that stuff.  You don't go from what he left on the message like that to, well, you know, I'm embarrassed.  But you're not embarrassed.  You're embarrassed maybe if you slip and put something in that you were like, ah, that's embarrassing.  That is so, like, over the top that you're not embarrassed by it.  That's the way you talk.  I'm embarrassed when I text T-O-O instead of T-O.  Oh, yeah, with there and there.  There and there is a biggie for me. 
[01:24:00]  I get very embarrassed.  Your.  Your and your.  Your and your days of your.  All right, right.  Yeah, you are.  He's not embarrassed.  But it has to be said, he's, you know, he's trying to protect his ass because.  Of course he is.  They're all taking a close look at all of us and can't wait to fuck up our lives.  Oh, they love it.  So he's going into protection mode here.  Left that for Jonathan Martin.  When I see that voicemail, when I see those words come up across the screen, I'm embarrassed by it.  I'm embarrassed by my actions.  But what I want people to know is the way Jonathan and the rest of the offensive line and how our teammates, how we communicate, it's vulgar. 
[01:24:30]  It's it's not right.  When the words are put in the context, I understand why a lot of eyebrows get raised.  But people don't know how John and I communicate to one another.  Exactly.  One thing I'm saying that another thing with a white man using the N word.  That's just how do you how do you.  Yeah, there you go.  That's the embarrassing culture of football. 
[01:25:00]  Shit.  There you go.  That's how football handles race.  White man.  What about a white man?  I would be I would absolutely say so.  So what?  Or how about this fucking pussy reporter saying anyone's saying nigger, whether they're white or black.  If he had that policy, I'd have a white man saying N word.  That's the issue.  So what?  Right there.  He doesn't have to confront black people.  Of course.  Fucking.  Ugh.  Everyone.  It's so annoying.  Everyone should be able to say the word. 
[01:25:30]  Ugh.  It's consequences.  But why is it okay for one group to be allowed to say the word and other groups not?  And one group that apparently the group that is supposed to be offended by it is the group that uses it the most, first of all.  And it's gotten to the point now where I don't even think black people give a shit.  It's these white liberal douche fucks that care if another white person says the word nigger.  They can't fucking handle it.  I don't know why. 
[01:26:00]  I don't know.  Oh, it's ridiculous.  Enough baby talk.  You're being scolded over the fucking voicemail.  Scolded over the voicemail.  No, if a white man...  This is exactly why I have such a fucking lack of respect for people clinging to that Redskins name.  This is how football looks at anything racial.  They are fucking cowards.  Hold on, though.  Miami hasn't done anything crazy yet.  Not necessarily Miami, but I mean the culture of the NFL.  You know, Incognito's hanging out and they're trying to figure this shit out. 
[01:26:30]  They have said he'll never play again for the Dolphins, but I wonder if that's completely  true.  I can't stand the way this reporter's...  Because they haven't officially done anything yet.  No.  The way this reporter's giving him shit.  And the reporter doesn't work for the NFL, but it's like...  It's just that's the way they look at it, and that's how it's handled with kid gloves.  I think a better way to say it, Jimmy, the NFL should come out and be the one saying this  is the shit that we all know happens in locker rooms.  This type of culture.  Where they go a lot further than society, and everyone is pretty much cool with it. 
[01:27:00]  And why should there be this separate thing where white people can't say certain words  that black people can say?  Like, if you want everybody to get along and you love this diversity in this country and  everything, what's the difference?  Then why should it be any different if a white guy says a word that black people apparently  don't like, which I don't believe anyway?  Why is that a big deal?  Why is it a big deal? 
[01:27:30]  And why isn't the NFL coming out?  The same type of defense.  Or a people...  A Richie Incognito.  Why isn't...  All the people that scream and cry about the Redskins name, why aren't they being as vocal  in defending Cognito?  Right.  You know what I mean?  It's like, it's just this fucking arbitrary outrage, and it's just so embarrassing and stupid.  I hope he plays again.  With a white man using the N-word.  How do you tell America, how do you expect anybody in America to believe you're not a 
[01:28:00]  racist?  Right.  I'm not a racist.  Oh my God.  And to judge me by that one word is wrong.  In no way, shape, or form is it ever acceptable for me to use that word.  What?  Even if it's friend to friend on a voicemail.  Well, he has to.  Pause.  But he has to say that.  He doesn't believe that.  But he has to say it because of the world we live in.  Because that's the world we live in?  Yeah.  Look, sorry.  I tend to, on Twitter, I tend to post a lot of crimes, heinous, horrible murders and  rapes committed by certain members of the black community. 
[01:28:30]  And I think it's a perfectly acceptable word in those circumstances.  I would think that the families of these victims probably have used the word.  Does that make them racist?  No.  But I think if you want to, if you're that angry at somebody, if they've killed or maimed  someone that you love, why wouldn't you want to use the worst word possible?  You're going to pull back one notch?  I would use that, but I'm not a racist. 
[01:29:00]  He raped and murdered my daughter, but I'm not going to use that word.  It's phoniness.  It's phony.  Yeah.  Stop lying to yourselves and everyone else.  Well, he continues.  Right, wrong or indifferent, because of all this, you've become the face of bullying in  America.  Somebody thinks of a bully, they think of Richie Incognito.  This isn't an issue about bullying.  This is an issue of mine and John's relationship where I may, I've taken stuff too far and I 
[01:29:30]  didn't know it was hurting him.  Did Jonathan Martin overreact or Jonathan was hurting that much?  I can't sit here and tell you who overreacted, who did what.  I can just sit here and be accountable for my actions and my actions were coming from  a place of love.  No matter how bad and how vulgar it sounds, that's how we communicate.  That's how our friendship was.  And those are the facts and that's what I'm accountable for. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  He knows better than anyone else what their relationship was like.  And if that's the type of communications they had back and forth, this kind of, you know,  abusive, vulgar things.  I mean, I don't know anybody that doesn't have a friend, at least one friend, that you discuss  things like that.  You're like, hey, you fucking asshole.  Hey, piece of shit.  What's up?  Yeah.  It's the way people, what do we like to think that that isn't happening?  Or that if you take it completely out of context, you're the one that knows better than the 
[01:30:30]  person that got, sent or received the message?  And all the people that complain that, like, oh, the government's doing this and that.  Uh-huh.  Like, when you see stuff like this happening, this is how our culture has its head up its  ass and is fake with each other.  Firmly.  So we deserve whatever we get because we're not communicating honestly.  We're not being truthful.  We're not going, you know what?  Eh, maybe that was a dick thing.  But, you know, in the context of the locker room, it's like, oh, let's scold him and let's 
[01:31:00]  get him and let's use him as the example for the shit that we've co-signed for for years.  Sounds like Martin couldn't take it anymore.  The pressure was mounting and he panicked and left the team.  Yeah, he didn't like it.  Yeah.  He didn't like it.  Because there was a text thing that went back and forth between these two guys after this  all went down, which we're going to play in a second because Incognito discusses it.  But first this.  You're telling me there wasn't any signs going into that?  You know, as the leader, as his best friend on the team, that's what has me miffed. 
[01:31:30]  How I miss this.  And I never saw it.  I want to know, did Richie Incognito just say miffed?  Miffed.  This has me miffed.  He was miffed.  Do we want this type of dishonest talk from people?  Do you think Richie Incognito is a normal thing because I was a bit miffed?  Miffed, right.  He's probably like that faggot he cried.  Yes, exactly.  But it's really starting to sound like these two were really close.  Uh-oh.  You know.  You thinking Guy Fieri and his hairdresser close?  Mysterious? 
[01:32:00]  Mysterious.  A little mystery here.  A little DL action?  I don't know if it's mysterious, but there's a bit of a mystery here.  You say it's impossible homosexuality?  Homosexual.  A little mystery, but I'm not sure if it's mysterious.  Yes.  But it's pretty obvious if you're following the story that these guys, yeah, were buddy-buddy  with each other.  And then something went...  Buddy-buddy?  But something went wrong.  Something went wrong.  Yeah.  Is it the pressure of, you know, trying to perform in the NFL that got to Martin?  Could be.  Oh, dear. 
[01:32:30]  And then he needed a reason why he was leaving the team?  Yeah.  Was this the actual reason that he left the team in the end?  He had a little tiff.  He had a miffed.  He had a miffed.  How I missed this.  I missed it.  And I never saw it.  I never saw it coming.  Uh-oh.  There's so many subplots in this.  How much has come out where you've looked at it and said, that's not even close?  I think the whole thing I've been sitting there saying, that's not even close.  It sounds terrible.  It sounds, when it's on the screen, it sounds like I'm a racist pig. 
[01:33:00]  It sounds like I'm a meathead.  It sounds a lot of things that it's not.  Well, the meathead comes from the video of you losing your fucking mind, sure, listening  to a bar.  Yeah.  He's fucking crazy.  Are you going to hold up to that one, at least?  Yeah.  All right.  And then finally, this from over the weekend.  When John left the team on Monday, we played a game on Thursday.  I spoke with John on Friday.  But you spoke with him?  I texted with him.  I text message, text message. 
[01:33:30]  I just spoke with him through text message.  And he texted me and said, I don't blame you guys.  I blame some stuff in the locker room.  I blame the culture.  I blame what was going on around me.  And when all this stuff got going and swirling and bullying got attached to it and my name  got attached to it, I just texted him as a friend and was like, what's up with this  man?  And he said, it's not coming from me.  I haven't said anything to anybody.  And I'm like, you know, okay.  Are these texts you'd be willing to share?  No question.  I'll give you, after this interview, I'll give you my phone. 
[01:34:00]  And we'll walk through all these texts.  And I will show you the framework of a friendship.  Jonathan Martin.  Cockpicks.  Sitting right here next to you.  What would you say to him?  I think, honestly, I think I'd give him a big hug right now because we've been through  so much and I'd just be like, dude, what's going on?  Why didn't you come to him?  I believe that.  I believe that part.  There's more to this.  Yeah, yeah.  There's something going on.  There's something going on.  On.  Frida. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  You know, that's the broad from ABBA.  What?  Really?  Yep.  And Phil Collins is drumming in that song.  Oh, he really was.  I thought that was a joke.  No, that wasn't a joke.  I don't know.  It does sound like a Phil Collins kind of a beat.  He had his sound.  This is Susudio.  So, what do you guys think?  I think, again, it's reinforced that the media is shit.  Pukey.  Is phony.  But we're part of the media.  Bullshitty.  Yeah.  No, but not really. 
[01:35:00]  No.  We're not part of the media.  That's what people tell us all the time when we say that.  But you're the media.  Really?  Yeah.  Okay.  I think we have different takes on stuff in general.  If I was the media, the true sense of the word media, I'd have been thrown out a long  time ago.  I'd have been drummed out of the service.  And we're not looked at like the way the regular media is looked at, where all of these guys  are giving us real news.  People know that.  The media is phony.  I like the incognito in that interview.  Yeah.  Yeah, he sounded, you know.  I think he really is in an atmosphere and a culture where that word is a little more accepted. 
[01:35:30]  Exactly.  Well, I mean, on a much lower level, I do have to say this, when I was all in playing  basketball, the famous story where I got knocked out because I said, nice shot.  Oh, boy.  What'd you say?  I personally don't like saying that word or the C word.  But I said, nice shot, nigga.  And I said it that way, too.  I didn't say er.  Oh, boy.  And next thing I know was I was looking up because I was on the ground on my back. 
[01:36:00]  Oh, no.  This is a fucking true story.  I'm not pumping it up or nothing.  Because you said that to Colin Ferguson.  Exactly.  My friend Gary at the time.  And we hung out.  We were on the team together and played a lot of pickup.  You know, I was in the culture.  And I really thought it was more than okay to say the word because I heard them saying  it to each other.  Of course.  Those people.  So then I felt good.  He hit it like a three-pointer, even though the three-pointer wasn't invented yet. 
[01:36:30]  That's how far I go back with basketball.  And he fucking knocked me out with one punch.  That's crazy.  Did that end your friendship?  Yeah, it kind of did.  I don't honestly...  Fuck him.  What a dick.  Yeah, what an asshole.  Fuck him.  You don't really come back from being knocked out by somebody.  It kind of makes it awkward.  What did he say to you after that?  I don't remember, Jimmy.  I'm not going to try to even figure it out.  I don't remember.  You know, you're talking about a 16, 17-year-old kid at the time.  So, you know, that's what? 
[01:37:00]  30 years ago now.  What?  30 years ago now.  And you were how old?  So, in my dumb little world, you know, you feel like, you know, there's things that are definitely more accepted.  Well, yeah.  I mean, what are we expecting from our professional football players at this point, too?  What are we expecting?  Well, they're supposed to...  Couth?  Fucking class?  Or, you know, what do you expect from them? 
[01:37:30]  They're supposed to be animals.  Gladiators.  They're ogres.  They basically go into battle every Sunday.  We want them to perform and give us exciting football games.  Right.  And then we also want them to not do the N-word.  Right.  It's ludicrous to think that.  Dopes!  We're absolutely a fucking...  Like, we're just a fake culture.  And it makes me so fucking sick that with language we deny who we are. 
[01:38:00]  We've always done that.  Right.  We don't admit that we like porn on a real level.  Right.  We say it, but we still allow fucking pornographers to get put in jail.  Yeah.  We all...  We all...  Oh, that's terrible.  That's why we judge politicians on their scandals.  Yeah, yeah.  That's why fucking gay politicians have to legislate against gay.  It's fucking sickening.  Yeah.  You just...  You watch the way the media handles these people and the holier-than-thou attitude.  Meanwhile, when they go home, I guarantee you, more times than not, they're doing the exact 
[01:38:30]  same thing that they're so outraged at the people that they're interrogating on camera.  Phonies!  You know, going back to Gary knocking me out, where I realized...  Gary knocked me out!  You know that nothing happened to the kid?  No, huh?  Yeah.  You know.  It was handled on the basketball court.  I woke up.  Oh, man.  It was embarrassed as all fuck.  Yeah.  Never said it again in those circumstances. 
[01:39:00]  And we just kind of moved on with our lives.  He was still part of the team and stuff, but we just kind of just kept our distance.  We're never really chummy after that.  She said, why'd you hit me, you fuck?  But I remember, no one...  We didn't have to go down to the principal's office or any of that shit.  Uh-uh.  No suspension.  I think it was after school, though.  No gunfire.  I believe it was after school in the...  Apparently, that doesn't matter these days.  After school.  Home.  Home.  Out of school.  They kept the gyms open and we got to play. 
[01:39:30]  So...  The phones are about to go out.  Remember, Sam, I said we need these phones fixed.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, you said it multiple times.  Multiple times.  How's the online feed doing?  Oh, boy.  What?  Art Bell's still not happy.  Is he still part of SiriusXM?  They're still running his reruns.  Yeah, they're probably not letting him quit.  Why did he leave?  Was it the online feed was so bad?  He is quitting because of everything we have said on this program.  Yeah, it's just one... 
[01:40:00]  Everything.  I can't get the phones back.  Mars, the phones are still...  Mars, look at that error.  It's a software problem.  It's a runtime error 53.  Right.  File not found.  What does that mean, Mars?  Runtime error 53?  I don't know.  Oh, boy.  Why do the phones keep going out?  Do you know what it is?  No.  It's a runtime error.  What is a runtime error?  No idea.  It sounds very serious.  What does that mean, runtime error?  Do you know? 
[01:40:30]  No.  Oh, Mars.  What do you mean, no?  File not found.  I think I don't know something.  Could be corrupt.  Could be something corrupt.  A corrupt file.  Maybe a kernel.  A kernel?  I don't know.  What?  A packet?  It's not getting a packet?  Uh-oh.  That's bad.  Just lost all the phones, too.  System assistant, producer, icons.  Oh, boy.  I know most people are happy we lost the phones, but a few of those guys did have some good  things to say.  The online feed is never good. 
[01:41:00]  They can't find a bitmap file.  What's going on?  Who cares?  As long as the phones work.  Yeah, what do we need any bitmaps for?  Fuck that.  Just answer the phone.  Well, it's a little picture of the number three, maybe, for the fucking line three.  A bitmap.  That's how you don't get lost in bit.  What are you talking?  I don't know what the fuck that was.  Yeah, it's right over your head.  Clever Yuma.  Yuma.  Or Yuma.  Yuma.  Chipper.  Hey, look at the pregnant broad.  And her posse. 
[01:41:30]  I wonder.  Prego posse?  Her tits are getting pretty big, right?  Yep.  And a little bit of meat on that ass, too.  A little meat on her ass.  Really disrespectful to talk about a lady who's got up with a child.  Oh, God.  Stand him.  I guess we restart the computer.  Talk about her with respect.  A little restart.  Respects?  Respect.  That's good.  That booted up pretty quickly.  Now, open it up, Mars.  Let's see what happens.  Let's do the best you can. 
[01:42:00]  Uh-oh.  Could not attach the desired...  What?  What?  Hey, there's some phones.  Is the bitmap okay?  I think the bitmap is fine now.  You just need it.  Did you unplug it?  Did you plug it back?  Unplug your router and wait five minutes.  I'll stay on the line with you.  And then you're like, oh, it's so awkward.  You're like, I'm still here.  Okay.  A lot of calls today, or... 
[01:42:30]  So where you from?  New York.  How's the weather?  I don't want to discuss the fucking weather here with you.  Yeah, just fix my fucking problem.  Ah!  That's how you feel about Mars right now?  Yeah.  Mars is the best you can.  I'm still doing a good job.  I heard it, Craig.  All right, let me take this phone call.  We'll figure it out.  This is the guy I wanted.  Eric in New Jersey.  Go ahead, Eric.  Eric.  Morning, gentlemen.  Hey.  Hello, Eric.  Hey.  Andy, you've got to give me a second on this.  Now, it's...  Hey, can I ask you for...  Hold on.  You're a white guy, right? 
[01:43:00]  I am a white guy.  Okay.  I think it's important, considering the discussion we're having.  Go ahead.  Let it rip.  Yeah, I mean, I'm a white guy.  I live in Hackensack, so I'm barely...  He's trading in a Chevy for a Cadillac.  Yeah, I think you can.  That's right.  I like my Chevy.  Now, that word, it's just...  It's like a word association game.  You hear a white guy say the N-word, and the first thing that pops into black people's  line, anyway, is the Klan, and the hanging, and the lynching. 
[01:43:30]  I understand what you're saying.  You know, it's just a word.  Everyone's going to use it, but...  I mean, do you even see that at all?  Well, how come when black people use it, that doesn't pop into their heads?  They didn't enslave themselves.  They used it with an A.  Yes, they did, as a matter of fact.  They're goff.  Africans over there were the ones making the deals, my friend.  Yeah, but the Africans didn't say that word.  They say it with an A on the end.  I'm not with an E-R.  Oh, so I could do that? 
[01:44:00]  So I could say it with an A at the end?  Do I have a white guy, Eric, from New Jersey's permission?  Permission?  I don't need permission to say any fucking word I damn well please.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to use a Jaws reference here.  You know, you say Jigaboo, Spirit Shucker, everyone says, huh?  What?  You say Barracuda.  People go, huh?  What?  You say shark.  We got a panic on our hands on the 4th of July. 
[01:44:30]  You know, what you're saying is right about the way people react.  That's why you get a reaction out of people.  It's a phony reaction.  I'm not buying it.  Even though maybe blacks associate it with something horrible when whites say it, no one's disagreeing  with that.  I'm not, at least.  I disagree with the penalties that come with it.  Like, no one is saying, why do black people think of horrible things when they hear a white  guy say it?  I understand why.  And why is it different when a black guy says it?  Because I understand the context is different.  And when black people associate it differently coming from other black people. 
[01:45:00]  But I'm talking about this fake lack of saying it by the media when it's part of the story.  Or this zero tolerance policy in any context.  Even bleeping it out when it's a Richard Pryor record.  It's like everything else in this dumb fucking country.  There's no context.  There's no balance.  There's no ability to go, it makes sense here.  Case by case basis.  Right.  That's what we're talking about.  God.  Exactly.  I don't even think that exists anymore.  The case by case basis.  It's all this zero tolerance and 100% of the time we have to do this. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, I'm not buying it.  I don't buy the outrage.  I don't think that when you say the word nigger that most black people are thinking about  the atrocities against the slaves.  To tell you the truth, to be honest with you.  I don't think a lot of young black people even know what the fuck went on with slavery.  There's a complete lack of education on American history and what happened. 
[01:46:00]  So I don't even think that comes into play.  Unless you're talking to, you know, some fucking 60-year-old grandfather or something.  But I'm not buying the outrage.  It's phony outrage because there needs to be a power base.  Regardless of why, or, you know, that could be argued, why do you need a power base?  Well, we were powerless, blah, blah, blah, whatever.  I'm not even talking about the reason.  I'm just saying the word.  It's this phony outrage.  There's an ulterior motive to the outrage. 
[01:46:30]  No one's really pissed at a word that they hear every fucking day, a hundred times a day, where they live, where they work, where they hang out and play fucking games, whatever the fuck.  It's fake.  Thank you.  We had a shooting in Bryant Park over the weekend.  Speaking of, over a coat.  What happened?  Some 16-year-old, the thug wannabe, apparently did a good job of wanting to be because he acted just like a thug, wanted some guy's $700 fucking coat, I guess. 
[01:47:00]  What's up with this coat?  Why is it so popular?  It's an eight-ball jacket.  Coats provide warmth.  They're very good.  Put your mittens in the pocket.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Carry your sandwiches.  Supposedly they've had problems with this coat.  There's been a few other incidents.  I've had enough of coats.  There's always a coat in the ghetto.  Whether it was a goose-down jacket when I was a teenager, or fucking gazelle glasses. 
[01:47:30]  There's always an article of clothing that's getting people shot.  Here are the facts.  Bryant Park, I guess, it was free skating on Friday or Saturday night.  Was it Saturday night?  Well, maybe they ought to charge admission every night.  Free skating, usually got to pay.  It was free.  You have a kid.  He's wearing a Marmot.  Is that how you say it?  A Marmot coat?  I have no idea.  It's Gore-Tex.  They call it the notorious Biggie jacket.  Is that what Biggie used to wear?  And it's like $700 or $800.  And it's like $680 in this case. 
[01:48:00]  So you've got a kid.  He's skating with his cool jacket.  Another kid comes over and goes,  Hey, man, give me your coat.  And the other kid goes,  Fuck no, I don't want to give you my coat.  So, you know, instead of walking away, the guy decides to shoot him.  Well, he decides to just, yeah, fire his gun.  He fired a few times.  And you've got another kid who had nothing to do with this,  who's 14 years old, who's now paralyzed from the waist down.  So this guy who fired the gun should be killed by the state.  Oh, yeah.  We should kill him like an animal.  Fuck yes.  But, no. 
[01:48:30]  He was...  Shut up, Brian Park for jacket, then panicked.  He was saying some kind of shit on Facebook.  Oh, yeah.  Like, feds at my door.  I'm going out with a bang.  I'm going out with a bang.  Well, he should have...  No, of course not.  Of course he didn't.  Well, um...  I already said the N-word.  I don't feel like saying anything.  Was he a good chow?  Here's your...  Here's the Facebook post.  What happened?  He was basically live tweeting through, you know, Facebook.  Oh, was he?  Yeah.  He was live tweeting his arrest.  He goes, these niggas gonna have to take me out. 
[01:49:00]  Take my life.  These niggas been banging for like a fucking hour.  I ain't going to jail.  I reether take my life.  Love all my real niggas.  All my real shorties.  Feds try and kick down my door.  It over.  Where do I go from here, man?  Do I end my life?  I don't know what to do.  I fucked up. 
[01:49:30]  Feds at my door.  I'm going out with a bang.  Take my soul.  Yeah.  He was just arrested.  Yeah.  There was none of that.  There was none of that.  Yeah, there it is, too.  Why don't they interview him, though?  Yeah.  And sit down and go, now, why would you say the n-word?  The n-word.  How would the interview him and ask him that stupid question?  No black person has ever asked that.  Dude, yeah.  And it's used...  I can't even convey how much that word is used in the black community. 
[01:50:00]  I just wish that I knew that you could just, you know, take someone else's shit.  Growing up, I didn't have a lot of money.  I would have liked a coat like that.  I would have asked someone, you know, no, you can't have this.  And I would have to just walk away and go, okay, all right, then.  I'm going to lose my snorkel jacket.  I didn't know you could fucking fire some shots and get the jacket.  That's it.  Yeah.  16-year-old.  He's got a gun.  Illegal gun, I'm sure.  Absolutely.  It's in New York City, too.  So, um, just fucking unbelievable. 
[01:50:30]  All right, well, here we go again.  Derek in Philly.  Derek.  Anthony, how the fuck can you make a blanket statement such as black kids and black youth  not being aware of slavery?  I understand you're entitled to your argument, but to throw blanket statements and just nonsense  like that, what the fuck the fuck is that?  Why do you think that's nonsense?  When the young black people that I'm talking about are the ones that we read about that 
[01:51:00]  are involved in criminal activity and whatnot, do you think they're very well educated?  I think they're aware of me.  They can't even speak fucking English, dude.  They can't even speak proper English.  That's what I do.  That's what we do.  There's not even proper English.  So you're thinking that they're learning about about the history of slavery and not just  that there was slavery.  I mean, the history of it. 
[01:51:30]  Anthony, so those statements right there about their language, that's a cultural thing.  Just how you go up on your wrist.  Well, let me tell you that cultural thing.  Hang on to that culture and you'll be jobless because no employer wants a fucking employee  that cannot speak proper English.  And it's not a cultural thing.  People used to be well-spoken.  It turned into that because it's a lazy way to fucking talk.  That's what it is.  It's a lazy way to fucking talk.  Oh, boy.  You know, what I want to get to is the blanket statements you're making and doing them out 
[01:52:00]  as fact.  I don't want to go into culture this, culture that.  Well, culture this, culture that's what we're talking about.  We're talking about a culture that doesn't speak proper English and then wonders why  the unemployment rate is so high among young blacks.  When you fill out an application and can't even fill it out properly because your spelling  and grammar is an abomination, you're supposed to say, well, it's cultural.  Give me the job anyway.  If you have a job that.  Go to West Virginia and a trailer park. 
[01:52:30]  Well, they shouldn't get the job.  They shouldn't get the job either.  I'm just saying it's this no, no, it's a lot more widespread than impoverished whites  in West Virginia.  It's a cultural thing that transcends most of the black community.  This this un-fucking written rule that it's OK to listen to black people speak so improperly  that and not criticize them because it's cultural. 
[01:53:00]  It's ridiculous.  It's fucking ridiculous.  Look, go play with your cat.  Have a beer.  Calm down.  I don't know.  This is the hundredth break you've done on this.  I just I don't know.  Is it?  It is.  I'm not going to be convinced.  I see things with my own eyes and it's not I'm not blinded by this bullshit media,  by this bullshit kowtowing and eggshell walking that we have to do as far as when black people  are concerned in this country.  I like speaking openly about how I feel and how I see things. 
[01:53:30]  If I'm wrong, I'm not saying I'm right on everything.  And if I'm wrong, I'm willing to listen to other people's opinions.  I do it all the time on Twitter and on this program.  But I'm not going to be stopped from saying what I believe is the truth based on what  I see and hear.  It's hard not to do breaks on that.  I know we've done it before.  It's hard not to because the same thing keeps popping up.  It's a huge issue.  And we work in a job where what we say is what we live and die with. 
[01:54:00]  And when you see the inconsistency of people being punished for what they say, it really  is a frightening thing because it's like you could say some dumb joke, it's taken out  of context and you lose your gig.  Right.  So I guess maybe we're more focused on it than someone who's driving a truck who doesn't  deal with this every day or, you know, that's not your, your life isn't, oh my God, I'm  going to say this joke over the airwaves.  So that's kind of why we harp on it.  And it's always this new shit popping up.  It's not like we keep going, you know, we talk about IMAS a lot, but there's a million cases  since then, and that's the frustrating part. 
[01:54:30]  All right.  Let me, let me, let me go to Rich.  Thank you, sir.  Rich.  Oh, yes.  I'm the same.  Good morning, fellas.  What's up, Rich?  I've been talking to you guys for a long, long time.  What up, yo?  Okay.  Here we go.  Again, as African American male, I'm 43 years old.  Okay.  That word.  Man, that's old age.  Congrats.  That's right.  I'm an old man.  Congratulations.  You made it.  Wow.  Nigga.  Yeah.  What's up, Rich?  Nigga.  You know what I'm saying? 
[01:55:00]  It's the exact same word.  Yeah.  The only reason is because of how poorly they speak.  Right.  Okay.  Again, it comes out nigga.  Right.  Okay.  I got to tell you, as a teenager, anybody else, it could be a Puerto Rican, a white guy,  a Chinese guy.  If anybody said that word, here we go.  I'm knocking you out.  Oh.  I don't care how close we were, because you couldn't call me that.  Uh-huh.  I don't care how long, I don't care how long we were friends, because that word, okay, 
[01:55:30]  for 400 years, had, you know, a negative meaning towards it.  Okay.  There is no way to make it positive now.  Okay.  A lot of these rap songs, they call them now.  Somebody with his crap.  But they do call them that.  Exactly.  The rap songs are terrible.  I got a song you played the other day.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, you're from a little bit of the older generation or older demographic. 
[01:56:00]  It's not meant for you.  I can't believe, I can't believe, I can't believe he said that word 60 times in a minute  and a half.  Yeah, yeah.  A minute and a half.  Who?  That song you're listening to?  YG.  YG, yo.  YG.  I never even heard it, it's Kyle.  Yeah.  And, you know, a lot of, even Jay-Z, he says the same thing.  Oh, my nigga, my nigga, I cannot stand it.  So now, I ain't got the radio on.  I listen to sports radio. 
[01:56:30]  Okay.  I can't listen to the radio anymore.  I got to tell you.  I got to tell you.  I got to tell you.  Because we say it, the whole world says, oh, okay, because they say it.  It's okay for me to say it.  We have to stop saying it, and everybody else will stop saying it.  Well, the point, Richie, the point is, like, if it's such a horrible word, and I know what  you're saying, like, if I say to a black guy, hey, you're a nigger, he's going to punch  me in the face.  Like, I've known that my whole, and I wouldn't say that to an old black lady, either.  I would never say that to somebody, regardless of how badly they could kick my ass, because 
[01:57:00]  you kind of know it's a vulgar, vile thing to say.  Right.  But it's the lack of balance in the fact that we know that's a horrible thing to say, and  yeah, rap songs use it, and certain white guys say it, and it is what it is, but now  it's this whole fucking blanket thing of, let's wipe it out, let's pretend.  We've never thought it.  It's the lie behind it.  Yeah, no one's said it, no one's thought it, no one's used it.  Okay, I gotta tell you something.  Uh-oh.  I did want of y'all to say something horrible about, like, a Jewish guy on the radio. 
[01:57:30]  Man, they would shut the place down.  You'd do that?  I just talked about Henry Kissinger, my Jew, my Jew secretary of state.  Bar!  There'd be protests outside your office.  Not really.  Jews never protest.  Well, we're marking the street, like, okay, we want a job.  No, we're pretty safe here these days.  It used to be the Asians were the biggest group as far as getting shows kicked off the  air.  Yeah.  But blacks have returned to the champions of getting people fired. 
[01:58:00]  Reverend Al almost got us fired.  He was trying to get us fired.  That is a fact.  For our homeless Charlie thing.  And then the smart people that were running XM at the time said, oh, let's just give him  a radio show.  His stupid ego, he'll go for that.  And they waved the radio show in front of his eyes.  He grabbed that and he left us alone.  We all know what happened.  Yeah, exactly.  And the other thing you said about Anthony, about the education, I gotta tell you, a lot  of that, again, it falls on us. 
[01:58:30]  Because we have to, have to say, hey, look, oh, there's education, and then you have to  use this education.  It can't be, oh, well, it's got to know nothing.  Yeah.  I gotta just ignore him.  Well, we have to educate on you.  Well, you're right.  And that's another lie that's going on in this country, that not enough money is going  towards inner city schools for education.  That's a load of bullshit.  There's plenty of resources out there.  What's not being done is parenting, because there's no fucking parents.  There's a 75% illegitimacy rate, and that's what's needed. 
[01:59:00]  You can put all the resources in the school you want.  If the kids don't want to learn, aren't going to school, don't have any discipline whatsoever,  it doesn't matter how much money's being dumped into fucking schools.  But that, again, is what the lying politicians will do.  We need more money to help these inner city schools.  Inner city schools are getting more money than any other schools in the fucking country.  It's bullshit.  More lies, bullshit, and kowtowing.  Yes, sir.  For a couple years, I lived in the Bronx. 
[01:59:30]  And my daughter went to a charter school.  And everyone's charter school.  Excellent charter school.  Okay.  I just moved to New Windsor.  Good luck with those schools when de Blasio gets in there.  Yeah, yeah.  I just moved out here to New Windsor.  And I guess she's in a public school.  And the public school, it's a nice-looking public school.  Sweet, quiet, and all that.  I think she's the only black kid in the class.  But I think I say the workload is half of what it is in the Bronx. 
[02:00:00]  And I came to the teacher, and I said, hey, man, she's not getting any homework.  She's like, oh, the kids are out here, you know, they can only do one page.  My daughter had an hour of homework in first grade.  An hour of homework she was doing.  But that's stupid, too.  Yeah.  They learn enough during the day.  Fucking give them a break when they go home.  Go home and fucking relax a little bit.  I used to stress my ass off in my room doing two, three hours of homework at night.  I'm like, what the fuck?  Christ.  There's no time to do anything else.  Then what it is, again, is the parents. 
[02:00:30]  Because, again, I get out of school, have homework, and have a computer with us.  All right, Rich.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  You did good for yourself and your kids.  Congratulations.  It sounds like you're doing some of that parenting shit.  A little parenting.  Very good.  That's okay.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you for the call.  Rich.  Rich, thank you.  All right.  Jesus Christ.  Bye, sweetie.  Let's go to Dwayne in Virginia.  Dwayne.  Hey, not Dwayne.  Fontaine.  Oh, my God.  Get Jackie back.  Hi, Fontaine.  Hey, Fontaine.  What's up?  It's been a while. 
[02:01:00]  Hey, what's up, buddy?  Congratulations on the little girl, too, Opie.  I hadn't talked to you in a while.  Jesus, that's a while ago now, but thank you.  Yeah, no shit.  Hey, when we hear somebody say nigger, obviously I'm not speaking about all the black people,  but my guys, if we hear a white person say it, we don't automatically go to racism or  whatever.  We look around to see who the fuck he's with.  If he's in mixed company, like kid boys, you know, one of them happens to be black, they  probably have an understanding, and that's the way that they roll.  Right.  If he's with a pack of rednecks, then it might be a fight looming. 
[02:01:30]  But my son is in the army, right?  Fight.  And him and his boy, hey, sorry about it.  Yeah.  My son's in the military, and his boys refer to each other as horrible fucking racist names.  Cool, yeah.  These guys, they call him gook.  It's an Asian kid.  They call him gook.  They call my son half nigger, because you know Anthony, white girl to me.  Oh.  But they call my son half nigger.  They call the white boy white bread, peckerwood, all that shit.  But they are thick as thieves, and they don't give a fuck about that stuff. 
[02:02:00]  Of course.  And there's a weird thing, too, when you, like, I can only go by my own friendships  with, like, you know, Patrice or Keith or those guys, you know, that we would kind of, we  discussed this stuff ad nauseum at the cellar late at night and had brutally honest discussions.  And even when we were arguing about race, even though I knew that Keith or Patrice probably  wouldn't have punched me, it never occurred to me.  I mean, even when I was mad at these guys, because you get fucking heated, it never occurred  to me to go, like, yeah, well, you're a nigger. 
[02:02:30]  Never.  No.  And it wasn't like, oh, God, I'm a friend.  Like, you know, Keith would have been disgusted with me, but I think that he, you know,  I would have had to physically do something for him to hit me.  It wasn't a fear of being here.  Right, right.  It was like, you just know you don't do that.  You just, yes, it's like anything.  It's an atomic bomb.  Not that it would have wounded them.  Yeah.  But it would have been such an ugly place for me to be coming from.  But you probably would have been like, oh, you little nothing.  Like, I don't think I would have broken those guys' spirits, but it would have showed, like,  wow, what an ugly fucking little place you're coming from.  So it didn't even, there wasn't even a part of that equation. 
[02:03:00]  No, if I, if I use the word to describe a black person, it's not just like, oh, I'm pissed  off that somebody, you know, is driving too slow in the left lane and blurted out.  Much to people's chagrin, I'm not doing that.  But like I said, when I look at some type of fucking unbelievably horrific crime that  went down and it was perpetrated by a black person, I'm sorry.  Yeah.  The fucking word pops in my head because it's like, oh, you just, because you can't think  of anything more vile to fucking, uh, to call somebody. 
[02:03:30]  What are you going to do?  You know, give me a lobotomy?  Yeah, that'd be a fucking tough work.  Just trying to find it.  Yeah, exactly.  It's like hauling out a melon and just looking for one little seed.  Look like a magician with those swords in the box trick.  Trying to hit the fucking woman.  All right, bro.  Later, man.  All right, Fontaine.  All right, well.  So.  Yeah.  You know, sometimes you get mad at somebody at the point where you want to drop the proverbial 
[02:04:00]  atomic bomb of insults on them.  Regardless of their race, you've got to find the worst possible thing to call somebody in  that situation.  And for black people, hey, that's it.  What's going to happen to this kid with the Bryant Park shooting?  Not tried as an adult, I believe.  So, and then what happens?  Well, he'll go to jail.  Oh, maybe not life, right?  No, probably not life.  Oh, God, not even close to life.  No, no.  Not even close.  It's ridiculous.  30 years, though.  He'll probably get 30 years. 
[02:04:30]  I doubt it.  Attempted murder and paralyzing a 14-year-old?  I doubt it.  I see.  To be honest with you.  You know, I don't know.  I bet she's out to celebrate his 21st birthday.  It's not very tough.  I don't know, man.  They put him away, and then they get out and kill someone, and then you read the story  like, oh, by the way, he was fucking put away in 1998 for manslaughter.  And then it's like, well, why the fuck was he out?  I like to quote...  Hold on a minute.  Oh, go ahead, Jimmy.  Sorry.  Sorry.  I actually blanked on the name. 
[02:05:00]  It was for the guy from...  John Forsythe.  I totally forgot his name.  From fucking Dog Day Afternoon, he should be taken outside and squashed like a bug when  he's swimming.  Yeah.  But some people you just have to crush like bugs.  Yes.  I don't think there's a lot of money going to the urban schools.  This guy's going to explain, too.  Uh-oh.  Just a little school program.  My kid is...  And they had scholarships, and boy, did these parents fucking work their balls off to make  sure they got into this school instead of the schools in their area.  I'm not saying that they're...  They were fully aware to get them the fuck out of that neighborhood. 
[02:05:30]  I'm not saying it's...  And get them in a better school.  They're wealthy schools in the inner cities.  I'm just saying it's not a money issue at this point.  I agree with you.  A lot of money is going to education.  It's a parenting issue.  Of course.  And without parenting, you can't legislate or fucking throw money at problems like parenting  and discipline and fucking irresponsibility and lack of empathy.  And there's plenty of other things.  You've got to throw money at the parents.  I mean, not at them, but to educate them on what parenting means. 
[02:06:00]  And then don't have fucking six, seven, eight kids.  Of course.  It's the, you know, old problem that we've had here for quite a while.  We had a lot of kids in my family.  I am.  My mom blames the Catholic Church, though.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  You couldn't wrap that shit.  Oh, shit.  And she was bad at math, I guess, with the whole rhythm thing.  Oh, boy.  Why don't people just go suck and dick more?  Oh, man, this guy fucking went away.  Just suck dick more.  Let's all blow each other.  Blow your fucking line. 
[02:06:30]  I don't mean like that.  Let's take a break and let's go.  Oh.  That's against the Catholic faith, isn't it?  I don't know.  I think it's one of those rules.  I think they're softening up to the blow job.  I would hope so.  The fucking half the people that work for them are giving them fucking creeps.  Mike in Connecticut.  Mike.  Mike.  Well, I don't know where to start, but think about it this way.  Like, what if you got, you know, some parents, they work like two jobs.  You know, they don't have ties.  They're not educated themselves.  You know, for whatever reason, their life's fucked up and they had kids somehow. 
[02:07:00]  These kids, they're in the inner city.  They've got to get bused to their school from Bronx to the Manhattan area.  It's like two hours each way.  They come there so tired.  They've got these old textbooks.  I know people who work at these schools.  Oh, boy.  They put a touch at this advantage.  Their parents aren't smart, so they're not good at teaching their kids.  The kids aren't being helped by the system, so they get lost by the system.  Now, compare that to George Bush, who goes to Phillips Andover Academy in Manchester, New Hampshire.  Huge private school. 
[02:07:30]  Amazing campus.  You've got to pay, like, 50,000 years to go there.  George Bush.  Is all that fair?  Why is George...  Yes, it's fair.  It's fucking fair.  Oh, my God.  George Bush.  You didn't bring up George Bush, did you?  How fucking long.  There's a whole bunch of people who you guys never heard of.  Yeah, there's wealthy people that are able to afford better things than poor people.  Wow, welcome to America.  Holy fuck.  Everyone wants the Soviet Union. 
[02:08:00]  It's been getting worse, all right?  You know what?  GDP per capita in the U.S. has increased 33% since 1989, but incomes per capita for families  has decreased by 1% since 1989.  So where's all the money going to?  It's going to 1%.  Oh, wow.  Rich people are able to make more money than poor people.  Wow.  But rich people do stack the deck sometimes, though.  All right, sir, hold on.  You never call them savages.  You're so ready to call black people animals or savages. 
[02:08:30]  Those white guys in Boston curb-stopping, you were just like, oh, they're not rifling  through their pockets.  That's really fair, Anne.  That's a fight.  It's not a...  And by the way, the people that were standing there knew there was going to be a fight.  This isn't fucking walking up to someone, blindsiding them in the side of the face  as they're walking home from work and then rifling through their pockets and robbing them.  That's a savage crime.  I don't call just regular fights between anyone savage. 
[02:09:00]  It's a fight.  It happens.  But this knockout game bullshit and this fucking flash mob, you know, the things they give  fun names to when really they're nothing more than attempted murder and robbery, that  gets me a little pissed off.  And I do see savagery in that behavior when three people blindside one, rob them, and don't  stop kicking them.  Yes, it's savage.  What do you want from me?  I agree with the knockout game.  Those are terrible issues and we've got to work on them. 
[02:09:30]  Do we have to work?  There's the cop-out answer of the century.  We've got to work on it.  Nothing ever gets worked on because you have to walk on eggshells when it comes to certain  cultures.  I agree.  I agree with all of that.  Apparently you don't.  You need to come at this with some empathy and understanding.  Empathy?  How about empathy for the guy that's getting his face planted into the concrete?  How about empathy for the poor 50-year-old guy that was killed because of the knockout  game?  Yeah.  This is bullshit.  How about getting glasses for Emper? 
[02:10:00]  How about since we signed the...  Since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, five million manufacturing jobs have  left the U.S.  The middle class is being eaten alive in this country.  That's what's causing lots of problems.  Yeah, no shit.  I'm all for not having jobs go overseas, my friend.  But how do we stop that?  Is it the unions?  If you get a union guy that wants fucking $50 an hour to mop a floor, then there's going  to be a problem because the company is going to go somewhere else. 
[02:10:30]  And our people...  Let me ask you, the guy calling.  And this is a fair...  Are people ready to only buy American?  Like, we as consumers have a choice.  We can only buy American.  And if that message was sent out, we will only buy things manufactured here, then things  would stay here.  But we don't send that message out because we want things cheaper.  So again, we can't cry when business goes overseas when we're giving the message...  Oh, we love a bargain.  We want it cheaper.  Please let me respond to that.  Go ahead.  Okay, look.  That would be a good argument, Jim, 25 years ago. 
[02:11:00]  But things have gotten so bad.  These so-called American companies, which are really multinational companies, have moved  manufacturing so away from the U.S. that even our military can't buy American.  They have to buy radar ships and other crap from other countries, from like Malaysia or  Asia or whatever.  Yeah, they've got Chinese books.  Okay, so what is that that happens that causes that?  Like, okay, so take...  Capitalism.  Capitalism called multinational companies.  Wait, wait, wait.  That don't care.  Capitalism causes that.  So what's the solution? 
[02:11:30]  Capitalism.  So what's the system that's better?  Isolationism, yeah.  We need to...  Slow and incremental change.  You know, the people of the world coming together...  I'm not saying...  Capitalism is good.  Incentives are good.  Hold on.  Do you mean socialism is better?  I'm not saying...  Are you saying socialism?  I think...  Look, Europe has been socialist for like the last 50 years.  I'm not...  They're healthcare.  They spend less than half of what we do and they get better out...  Who?  Healthcare.  Europe.  They spend...  A European system?  Sorry.  Not into it. 
[02:12:00]  They get the bargain at a national level with the doctors and the producers of medical devices.  So their prices are so much lower than us.  And that's why people fly here to have fucking surgeries done from all over the world.  All the people fly to Germany to get their platelets spin.  All right, yeah.  Well, I'm not saying the Germans aren't brilliant, but you don't see these poor fucking dumb Indian  Siamese twins flying over to fucking France to have their surgeries.  Well, that's India.  I'm talking about Europe. 
[02:12:30]  I'm talking about Japan.  I was talking about the victims.  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  Chris wants in on this.  Chris is on the line with Mike.  This guy's a socialist.  What do you want?  Go ahead, Chris.  Okay, listen.  First off, if you want a European system, you go pay 85 to 95 percent of your income...  Yep.  ...to get that European system.  And also, they're all collapsing.  There's a reason why those countries are collapsing.  Because the government took all the money.  Yep.  ...to.  Ask all the public school teachers how come their children don't go to public school, 
[02:13:00]  and those public school teachers send their kids to charter schools and private schools.  There are black 1 percenters who are as elite as anybody else.  So get off that gravy train.  And explain to me community organizers who go with the black community, the urban community,  and tell them that their own effort is not good enough and that they're evil.  We bought slaves off of black slave owners in North Africa.  I think I'm done with your lesson today.  And if I was in front of you, I'd slap you in the back of your head to wake you up. 
[02:13:30]  Well, all right, all right.  Love this guy.  Well, you raised...  The one point you raised, which was right, is you're giving all the money to the government.  Like, that's the problem.  The government, when you look at...  You can't trust the government with all your money.  They're terrible.  Do you trust them with more...  They're horrible.  Look what they do with the money we give them.  They're dummies.  Yeah.  I don't trust them.  I don't trust them.  But look.  Look what happened.  Since the 1980s, when Reagan introduced those tax cuts...  Yes.  Our deficit has increased so much.  We're $16 trillion in debt. 
[02:14:00]  How is that good for our government?  Yeah.  Could you make sure you let us know that half of that was incurred under fucking Obama already?  Thank you.  Thank you.  Can I ask Chris?  I hate him.  I don't like him.  Chris, go ahead.  What about Bill Clinton?  Bill Clinton.  We hit a push.  Bill Clinton spent eight years talking about WMDs.  And I have news for you.  His surplus was a loan that George Bush had to pay back in his first quarter.  How about surplus?  Yeah.  Well, I'm not going to go back.  We could keep going back to Nixon with all these fucking presidents. 
[02:14:30]  So stop it.  Why don't we just talk about the current administration and get off of the Bush?  No jobs.  Eh.  What are you going to do?  All these presidents.  Hey, I've got to get back to work.  You guys go.  Hey, work.  All right, Chris.  Thank you, man.  Chris and Jerry.  He was pretty good.  It's just a regular guy.  All right, Mikey.  That'll work.  That's right.  Back to the job site, Chris.  All right, Mike.  It was good talking to you guys.  I'm a big fan of the show.  Of course it was.  Of course you are.  Thank you.  All right.  Yeah, get back to the job site.  Go over there.  Have your sandwich.  You call on your coffee break.  You don't call when you've got work to do. 
[02:15:00]  Pick up the phone.  You call.  Hey, how are you guys?  Boom.  Break's over.  Back to work.  Unless it's job-related.  Job-related phone calls.  You know, when's the concrete guy getting here?  Yeah.  Something like that.  Hey, it's raining.  Are we going to fix this hole in the roof?  What the heck are we doing over here?  Everybody's getting wet.  Got my lunch pail.  Regular lunch pail.  If we had socialism, more people would behave, though.  Oh, yeah?  Mm-hmm.  How's that?  Because they would have more.  That's true.  They would have more.  Maybe.  I like that.  What's your solution, Ian?  That analogy where if you had a room with 50 people in it, 
[02:15:30]  you gave everybody $100, come back after a while,  and one person would have all the money.  Wow, that's so true.  It's just the way people are.  Human nature.  There's human nature.  There's greed.  There's people that are stupid.  There's people that are smart, savvy.  It's just the way people are.  We like to think we're all the same.  Let me go to Chicago.  Mark, good luck.  Strap on your Kevlar.  Mark works in the public school system, 
[02:16:00]  so here's his take.  Go ahead, Mark.  I don't work for the public school system,  but I've worked in the schools doing work,  and in the South Side neighborhood,  in these horrible neighborhoods.  The baddest part of town?  Yeah.  If you go down there,  you better just beware of a man called Leroy Brown.  Yeah.  He's a gambler.  Likes his face, his clothes.  Likes to wear his diamond rings on everybody's nose.  Yeah.  He's got a custom Continental in El Dorado, too.  Yeah.  32 gun in his pocket for fun.  I also hear a razor in his shoe.  Yeah, he's bad.  Bad.  Bad. 
[02:16:30]  Leroy Brown.  He's the baddest man.  A whole damn town.  Badder than old King Kong.  You know, I heard King Kong went to Hong Kong.  Go ahead, Mark.  South Side of Chicago.  Yes.  Yeah, the schools are actually fine.  The teachers, they're very diverse.  They're from all over the place.  The kids are well-behaved in school.  I didn't understand it until I saw the parents picking them up,  and then I understood that the parents are beyond awful.  Yeah. 
[02:17:00]  Yes.  They just, and, you know, where you put the blame,  where you put the cause and effect, I don't know.  I don't know.  But I'll tell you something.  The parents are fucking terrible.  The parent.  Like I said, parent.  If they're lucky, because it's usually a grandparent that cares for some of these kids.  So, they're kind of doomed right from the start.  Something's got to be done.  There's no leadership.  There's no parenting. 
[02:17:30]  There's no discipline.  And someone brought it up in the past.  I forgot who it was.  Kinky.  The whole shame thing.  Like, there's no shame anymore.  People, years ago, and even now,  people don't do certain things because it's shameful to do it.  It's embarrassing.  And that matters.  The way you look in the public eye and stuff.  It matters.  In certain communities, there's a complete lack of shame. 
[02:18:00]  Nothing matters.  It's been replaced with, you know, being disrespected for some inane thing that doesn't matter.  But, like, hurting people, assault fucking...  A peppa.  Assault a peppa.  Your neighborhood looking like shit.  Just, there's no...  There's no basic human shame for it.  That's why I carry around a giant pointing finger and I'll just go...  You should.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame on you. 
[02:18:30]  I actually sing that.  Yes.  Well, you should.  All right.  No Tom Papa today.  Why?  Is he dead?  I don't know.  Jesus.  He might combine them all.  I think he overslept.  Come to Papa.  But the boys put a really nice little bit together for everybody.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Especially if you like the Lady Di.  Who doesn't?  And a lot of people like the Lady Di.  My extra-offer that I was talking to, and she feels so bad for Lady Di.  She's like, oh, she looks like a Cabbage Patch kid all grown up.  Oh.  She's so cute. 
[02:19:00]  Cabbage Patch.  She does.  Good news.  She's not mad at us, so.  No, no.  People were calling the after show.  They were saying that she was picking up her phone.  Yeah.  Every time they would call her.  Uh-huh.  A guy called her, because people would tweet when she gave, she tweeted out her phone number  on Friday.  Yeah, it was crazy.  What happened?  And people, people would tweet, she got bad advice.  Did you, did you see all the tweets from people going, it's not even fun?  No.  Because she's just picking up the phone.  Because she answers every question, like it's a real question.  Yeah.  Because like people, if you get a number like that, you're going to call and try to fuck 
[02:19:30]  with the person.  Yeah.  And they said, you can't even fuck with her because she's so out of it.  Oh.  And she answers every dumb question you throw at her like it's a real one.  Yeah, people were tweeting that if you need help with the Obamacare website, here's the  phone number.  Right.  And they give her a phone number.  Some guy said he called her and said, I'm having some trouble with the Obamacare website.  Can you help me out?  And she said, well, I can't because I'm on the phone right now, so I can't get to the  internet.  Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.  As opposed to saying this is not the right number. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah.  But people tweeted.  They were defeated.  They were so bummed out that they couldn't have fun with this whole thing.  Welcome to movie phone.  Seinfeld.  And did she say the voicemails for us like we asked?  I don't know what she did.  Could someone ask her if she saved the voicemails?  Probably not.  We don't have her new phone number and we would really like to hear some of those.  She DM'd me.  You tricked me.  She's a bumbling clod.  A bumbling clod.  Yes.  I want to hear the voicemails. 
[02:20:30]  She's a bumbling clod.  Well, with that said, the boys put this together.  Welcome to Attainable Dating Solutions.  Video dating for the unwashed and socially inept.  Profile F-A-T-3-O-3-9.  Lady Di.  Hey, my name is Lady Di.  From the retarded Luver and Shirley.  The only thing I love more than the bottle is the dick.  I'm looking for a man to go on a cruise with. 
[02:21:00]  Okay.  A very nice muscular man.  Has to be well endowed.  Okay.  Am I doing all right so far?  Yeah, great.  Okay, and to have sex with on a balcony.  For the right man, I'm willing to give oral on a balcony.  Even though it might be against your instincts.  I prefer somebody to not throw me off the balcony and bend me over and give me the old hee-ho.  I'm into the following things.  Water sports.  Ass play.  I'd be willing to experiment with toys.  Under the right circumstances, I would go both ways. 
[02:21:30]  So feel free to bring a friend.  Call into the Opie and Anthony Show.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  That's 866-969-1969.  And give me the ride of my life.  You think anybody's going to call back on that one?  100%.  Call the Opie and Anthony Show today.  Lady Di does.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:22:00]  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show is back.  Go on, sit down.  The celebrities are ready to entertain you some more.  Knowing me, knowing you.  Uh-huh.  There is nothing we can do.  Knowing me, knowing you.  Uh-huh.  We just have to face it this time.  See, there's the guys.  They're singing the band. 
[02:22:30]  Keep smiling.  Breaking up is never easy.  I know.  Abba.  It's Abba Day on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Or Abba.  What do you say?  Abba, Abba.  I'll give you Abba.  I say Abba.  Abba.  Abba.  Their last album was The Visitors.  Back in 1982.  82?  And they've sold 380 million records worldwide.  That's a lot of records.  And Sam continues to laugh. 
[02:23:00]  Because he's a closed-minded fuck.  There's nothing closed-minded about it.  He's so closed-minded.  There's just no reason to celebrate Abba.  You're laughing at a band that sold 380 million records.  A lot of records.  You've got to respect that shit.  Well, they're still selling records.  So that means 30 years from now, you're going to laugh at Jay-Z.  If Jay-Z is irrelevant 30 years from now as Abba is today, then yeah, I probably won't be.  Abba's not irrelevant.  Do you know Abba is probably still selling?  You could spin around the radio dial right now and you will hear an Abba song.  On the oldie station. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah.  I bet they're still selling records, too.  To old people.  I don't know.  I bet a lot of kids are getting interested in the Abba.  The play's not even happening anymore.  That's all they have left.  Mamma Mia is still around.  Not here.  It's gone.  Yeah, it's touring.  What's over there now?  Rocky.  Oh, they're doing the Rocky musical?  I've got to go see that.  This has got to be horrid.  Why?  I don't know.  Whenever they turn things into musicals.  It's funny you should say that.  I wasn't going to mention this, but now that you mentioned that, they are running out ideas 
[02:24:00]  for Broadway because, remember, Lannis Morissette and that monster album of hers, Jagged Little  Pill?  Yeah.  Sam Roberts sold a few, that thing sold a few copies.  Yeah.  They're turning that into a Broadway musical.  Are they?  Why?  Why would you do that?  I don't know.  Is there a video of Rocky?  Do we get a preview?  Rocky the Musical is opening at the Winter Garden Theater.  Oh, good.  I was hoping.  It's already open, right?  Is it?  Yeah, it's open.  Is it?  See, hold on. 
[02:24:30]  On drugs?  She's going to explain the whole story of Jagged Little Pill.  I look forward to taking the heart of Jagged Little Pill and expanding its story, flushing  it out into deeper layers of emotionality, specificity, specificity, specificity, specificity,  specificity, specificity, specificity, specificity, specificity, there's too many eyes in this  word, specificity, specificity, specificity, she's got charm, specificity.  Specificity, specificity, specificity, specificity, specificity, specificity, say it or I'll kiss you. 
[02:25:00]  Specificity.  Okay, so this, look at dumb Sam, Sam's too ashamed to even try it out loud, he's moving  his mouth.  Specific, specific stuff.  Yeah, specificity.  How do you spell it?  Uh, S-P-E-C, uh, S-P-E-C, uh, S-P-E-C, uh, S-P-E-C, uh, S-P-E-C, uh, I-C, I-F-I-C-T-Y.  Yeah, I think there's an extra, uh, wait, specificity, specificity.  S-P-E-C, I-C, I-F-I-C-T-Y. 
[02:25:30]  Try to say that word, oh, specificity, it's there.  It's there, but you gotta slow your fucking brain down.  Specificity.  Specificity.  Specificity.  Yeah, S-P-E-C-I-C-I-F-I-C-Y.  No, there's another C in there.  Origin?  There's another C in there.  Use it in the definition?  Uh, the definition is, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the action of being specific.  Ah, yeah, that's a good one. 
[02:26:00]  No.  Yeah.  Like, the specificity of her vagina made me like her.  It's not specificity.  Isn't it?  It's specificity.  Specificity.  There's two C's in this word, Jimmy.  Specificity.  No.  Specificity.  Specificity?  Not specific.  I say it's specificity.  No, dummy, it's not specificity.  Specificity.  Specificity.  Specificity.  Specificity.  Specificity.  Specificity.  No.  Specificity.  There's two C's in it. 
[02:26:30]  Right.  Specificity.  Specificity.  The 50 is at the end.  Specificity.  Not specificity.  I say it's specificity.  Specificity.  Specificity.  Specificity.  Specificity.  Specificity.  Not specificity.  I still say specificity.  Specificity.  Specificity.  Specificity.  Specificity, I got it.  Specificity.  Maybe Anthony's right.  God damn it.  Specificity.  I got it.  I got it. 
[02:27:00]  Remember when Felicity cut her hair?  Specificity.  Am I wrong?  I'm probably wrong.  Hold on, hold on.  So specificity, humanity, power, physicality, spirit, and fabulism, Morissette said in a  press release as far as Jag a Little Pill making it to Broadway.  Ah.  Oh, I wonder if they're looking at that line in there.  That'll be the big line where everyone goes, woo!  You go, girl!  Oh, I would not get up and walk right out of the theater.  That type of trash.  And every time by the time I say, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, 
[02:27:30]  by the way, Rocky is...  We're fucking rocking!  Don't get away, don't get away.  All right.  It's not fair to deny me.  Yeah!  Yeah.  This broad is angry.  Fuck.  She's 90s angry.  You don't want to mess with her.  She's only 39, by the way.  Really? 
[02:28:00]  That album came out a long time ago.  Anthony was right.  Specificity.  God damn it.  Specificity.  I know, I'm sorry.  Specificity.  I'm a dummy.  That's like specific gravity.  The specific gravity of something.  Specific.  Hey, where did that satellite hit, by the way?  Because the news was hitting, it could hit one of us on the head.  I'm assuming it didn't hit anyone on the head.  It probably either hit...  I thought, though.  75% of the Earth is water.  And then a lot of land, but a lot of land ain't being used.  Big, just nothingness.  Look at Australia. 
[02:28:30]  The coast?  Yeah.  There's a few cities there, but the middle of it, nothing.  All right, where did it hit?  Africa, Sahara Desert.  You got that.  Where did it hit?  Where did it hit?  That's all I want to know.  Or did it just burn up in the atmosphere?  I understand geography.  I want to know where this fucking thing hit.  I don't know.  And they kind of knew about, right?  No, I don't think they had a fucking clue until it started bouncing off the atmosphere.  They kind of don't really know.  Yeah, it was the whole bouncing thing.  Oh.  Where did it hit?  Atlantic Ocean.  Ah.  Ah, see.  Boring.  Exactly. 
[02:29:00]  Rocky starts in February, by the way.  Oh, see, I didn't think I saw it on the fucking...  Well, the theater's up.  On the docket?  Yeah.  The theater's, that's where I thought it was open.  I haven't been past the old winter garden in a while.  What is it?  Like, fucking...  Is it all music?  Or is there talking?  It's a musical.  Well...  Rocky's a musical.  Is it going to be like...  Da-da-da!  Hey!  Take her to the zoo!  The retards like the zoo rock!  Take her to the zoo!  The retards like the zoo!  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!  Throw the turkey out the window! 
[02:29:30]  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!  Throw the turkey out the window!  I don't sweat you!  Throw the turkey out the...  All right.  This is Cuff, and this is Link.  These are my turtles, Cuff and Link.  Oh!  They do it because they want to do!  They do it because they want to do!  They do it because they want to do  Mickey is a Jew 
[02:30:00]  They do it because they want to do  Is this the pre-view?  Mickey  Mickey is a Jew  And the big close of the first act is  Hey woman, hey woman, hey woman  Hey woman  Hey woman, hey woman  Oh jeez, this looks terrible  Go backwards  And also Dr. Steve just tweeted  But you've got to call the show, Dr. Steve, please  He has a little story about Jagged Little Pill  This is Rocky's musical  The Preview 
[02:30:30]  Alright, a little boxing  Pretty much like my life  Not being recognized  Not having love in my life  Just feeling very alone and isolated  So I thought, why don't I take those feelings  And put them in the body of a boxer  And I had no idea  That there's so many millions of people  That felt the same way  I know the older I'm getting  The more disappears  Oh, that dumb Broadway voice  But I'm hearing your voice in my head saying 
[02:31:00]  Don't let this go  Rocky's the story of the underdog  The person who always wanted something  And never quite was able to achieve that  And then gets a second chance in life  Make a new start  Rocky fight from the heart  Here are characters with tremendous heart  Tremendous emotion  Who yearn to find one another  And to find love  And to redeem themselves  Something like truth 
[02:31:30]  Something like war  Something like fear  Isn't this wicked?  Doesn't this sound like wicked?  Rocky's story, I think, is completely universal  What Rocky's able to do  When no one believes in him  Is, you know, a global idea  That any of us can  Do what we dream of  If we set our mind to it  What I liked about Rocky  He's just a kind guy  Gotta have that song in there  He's not the fastest  He's not the strongest  But his pride 
[02:32:00]  Is so explosive  He doesn't win the fight  But he wins the love of his life  So it's quite a wonderful romantic story  The big song  My girl's a four-eyed six  It's not the most important part  It's a story that comes from generation to generation  About how everyone is entitled to a moment of dignity  Fight from the heart  Punching that beef in the ribs 
[02:32:30]  He's not fighting anyone  Yes  You're pregnant and your tummy's sore  Is that a stewed tomato on the floor?  You shouldn't have picked up the dog food  Yeah, collapse on the dog food  Collapse on the dog food  Our baby has the hair of a ten-year-old boy  That sounds awful  There's some good stuff in here  That really does sound awful 
[02:33:00]  They all have that dumb fucking  If we believe  Oh, I hate that shit  I wanted the beef so badly  Yeah  I know  I don't have a beep anymore  I don't know where it went  It's not even like  It says beep  And then it doesn't show up  I did too  A little line about Apollo  Yeah, of course  Punch that beep in the fist  Apollo is bigger 
[02:33:30]  I'm going to punch Apollo soon  Because I want it  I don't know where they'd go with it  Yeah, of course  Exactly  I want to get paid  Just for fighting  Yeah  I don't know what's  What's the big hullabaloo  I'm just going to punch you  In the face  Here's the big closing number  Yo, I really hit that 
[02:34:00]  Hard  So we look forward to Rocky  Rocky, the new big musical  That replaces  Abba's Mamma Mia  Yes  Which replaced  Cats  Which was supposed to be now and forever  At the Winter Garden Theater  Which replaced  That I don't know 
[02:34:30]  Beetle Mania  No  Really  Beetle Mania  Was at the Winter Garden Theater  Oh no  Maybe it was at the Lundfond  They don't like changing stages over there  I guess it was at the Winter Garden  It's a big theater  They like getting that stage set  And that's this  How long was Mamma Mia there?  Lunger is a curious cat  Stupid cats  Now and forever  Now they had to change  It's now until Thursday  They didn't have the same rank  See? 
[02:35:00]  I saw cats  I did too  I love that  It's stupid but you kind of know it  I know  Why do you know it so well?  Well it was like  If you were white trash on Long Island  And you wanted to  Take a girl  To the big city  What?  For a show 
[02:35:30]  You went to  The Russian Tea Room  For dinner  And then you went over  To see cats  Now and forever  At the Winter Garden Theater  What a hack date  So many people did  Exactly that  I know  Now it's the Lion King  Tickets to the Lion King  It's the same thing  Yeah  Where do you go to dinner  Before that though?  Fridays?  No  It's the Russian Tea Room  It's Fridays  Guy's American  No it's a better place than Friday  It's gotta be a place  That's considered New Yorkish  Oh yeah  How's Guy doing  With that whole hairdresser fight?  He hasn't said much  Oh boy 
[02:36:00]  Really?  He hasn't really said much about that  Really?  No  That's  You see him hiding right now  That's mysterious  That was a little mysterious  He's kinda let that go  By the way  A little mysterious  Mamma Mia was there from 2001  Until 2013  Yes  12 years  Wow  Cats was there  82 to 2000  82 to 2000  What was that before that?  Before that was Othello  Oh  That was short  That was short  That was short  They fucked up with Othello  They fucked up with Othello  The Catherine Wheel  Camelot  That was there for a year 
[02:36:30]  Yeah they fucked up with that one  42nd Street  Was there for a year  Yep  Fucked up with that one  Zoot Suit  Gilda Radner  Was there for a year  Fucked up with that one  And then it was  Beatlemania before that  Beatlemania before that  Two years  Wow man  They didn't have it figured out  Until  Until Cats  Until Cats  Cats  It's a great song  Oh you like that song  But you don't like  Othello  Yeah but right 
[02:37:00]  And why does she go up  In the big tire  I don't even know  What that meant  I didn't get it either  It's elevated up  To fucking  I'm sitting there going  What does this  Dumb play mean  It seems sad  Yeah it seemed very sad  Yeah  Cats die  It's really sad  That you hear this  Outside your window  At two in the morning  And you want to  Throw water on this  Fucking thing  Quiet  Yeah it's all nice  That she gets carried away  They're all watching  It's all nice  Instead of  You know  Having half her head  Full of maggots  On the side of the road  Like a real dead cat 
[02:37:30]  Like poor little smoky  Would people cry  When this happened  When memories were sung  No by the time I saw it  I don't know  People  There were already  Japanese businessmen  Asleep in the front row  With their comp tickets  Snoring  Holy cat  Fucking  Getting hungry  Right  Yeah it's just like  Watching food  Dance and sing  It's like us  Watching a thing  Called mayonnaise  And tuna fish  There's burgers  And fries  Dancing  Oh no  They're going to  Cook and eat us 
[02:38:00]  Little french fries  All right  This sounds like  Don't cry for me  Like that vibe  Of Evita  It's all the same shit  Yeah because they all  Have that  Don't cry for me  Argentina  Who was that  I remember those commercials  For Evita  Evita  What was the  It's her name  I don't remember  I know Madonna  Did a good job  Jewish actress  Pone  La Pone  Patti La Pone  Patti La Pone  That's right  It was Patti La Pone  Who went on

That's exactly  What we're saying  He's not fixed  So the producer  Basically just grabbed  This guy  To make a viral video  Of course  We all know that

[02:45:00]  A little bit  Like hey  You know  Do us a favor  Why do you have the nice suit  Could you go  You know  Go a couple blocks away  From here  And just go to one of those meetings  So we don't feel like  Total pieces of shit  That we just exploited you  For a viral video  Say hi to Kevin  On Long Island  Kevin  Hey good morning guys  I'm out here in Brentwood  I love you guys to death  I'm a CEO at Rikers  I've been on the job  Since 98  And you guys got me  Through some really  Really bad times  Driving home  And you're laughing my ass off  I wanted to know  If you guys had ever seen 
[02:45:30]  A video on YouTube  It's called  I Fought for You  It's an old  World War II letter  Hold on one sec  Hold on  I'm really curious to see  We just did this bit  I'm so curious to see  What CNN says about this  Oh isn't that nice  They'll be like  Oh  You're going to be surprised  When they're positive  About the video  Of the homeless vet  Yeah  Cleaned up  But why can't they  Question and go  Well you know  How much help  Did they actually give him  Or are they just  Using him for a viral video  You guys  Just sound negative 
[02:46:00]  On everything  Yeah  Because they're not there  To shit on everything  They give a homeless guy  A haircut  And you kill him  You're all negative  Veterans  It's got 10 plus  Million hits  Yeah  I'm just curious  I'm going to make  A knock off video  Where I take myself  And I make myself  Look worse  Oh how are you  Going to do that  That is true  Everything will be  An improvement  Especially a bullet  No  We're going to continue 
[02:46:30]  To watch this general  But as a leader  Of young men and women  On the battlefield  When you watch this video  How does this make you feel  Like fucking the blonde  Doing the hairdo  Any veteran that's homeless  Is a tragedy for our nation  Of course it is  These guys have given  Tremendous  Tremendous service  To our nation  And they need to be given  The ability to transition  From this very seminal event  Of service to nation  There's nothing  That replicates that  Yeah you need some choppers  And having the ability  To make a transition  Back to their neighborhoods  And their communities 
[02:47:00]  Is extremely difficult to do  You're never more fulfilled  Than you were  When you were in uniform  You have a sense of purpose  A sense of direction  Camaraderie  And these bonds of love  And sacrifice  Are immense  And they're forever  There you go  Now let's really go deep  Well it's the veteran angle  You know  Right of course  Gotta take care of the boys  Yeah  It starts with confidence  From that opportunity comes  And certainly there really  Is a partnership  Between business  And our veterans administration  And great efforts 
[02:47:30]  Are being made  To address that  Well it just makes me wonder  How we got to this point  The statistics are so disturbing  Well Carol  If you let me talk  Is that her?  Yes  Chad  Chad  Chad  Chad  The alcoholism  And the drug addiction  And the mental illness  Caused by it  It's obvious what it is  They've seen some shit  Over there man  A little PTSD  Combine that with some boost  Let me say  Let's go back to Kevin  Go ahead Kevin 
[02:48:00]  So you're talking about  This YouTube video  Called I Fought For You  Yes  The YouTube video  Is called I Fought For You  It's an older man  He brings his two grandkids  He's listening to the car radio  He hears that they defaced  These U.S. flags  And some gravestones  For soldiers  So he brings his kids  Into a movie theater  And they have clips  My dad's a World War II veteran  He was a tail gunner  And B-29  In a Pacific theater  He flew 31 missions  So it kind of brought  It home for me  As far as my dad  We're pretty old 
[02:48:30]  He's in the VA hospital  Up in Stony Brook  Long story short  The video  I showed it  Like I said  I'm a correction officer  In Rikers  And the guys  I showed the video to  They had to walk away  They were getting choked up  And these guys are like  Real hardcore kickass guys  And they got choked up by it  And if you guys see it  I'm pretty sure  You're going to get choked up by it  I fought for you  It was put out by Gary and Bladder  To the Opie and Anthony show  They've had enough of us  Here we have it  Okay Sam allegedly has it sir  Arrested today 
[02:49:00]  For defacing the Kensington Park  Memorial  Alright cool  Thanks  Thank you  This kid's acting is terrible  People sure have short memories  And those who are too young to know  Like oh grandpa  He's  With guns

[02:50:30]  What happens  Who took the cliffs  These are the champions  Who helped free economy  Oh the kids are starting to watch  These are heroes  Who helped him  No no no  No more of your iPod  The kids are showing  Kick cock pictures  I've seen it  Oh see now the kids  Are starting to watch  Everyone's all interested now  Because Ronnie's talking  Oh boy  In the name of God 
[02:51:00]  And country  I learned to defy gravity  Oh boy  To honor my family  I lived in the belly of a beast  Uh oh  I fixed the hearts  Of iron monsters  I became a worm in the mud  I would run out of this theater  I think they're losing it  We're talking  I can't hear that movie  For God and country  I fought for you  I fought for you  For you  I fought for you  Oh boy  I fought for you 
[02:51:30]  I fought for you  I fought for you  But not you  For you  For you  For you  I fought for you  I fought for you  Who's this you guy  Yeah  And I'd do it again  Fighting for small sheep  I thought  Then you see the one black guy  Leaving the theater  But not for you  Uh oh  Who's coming into the theater  Uh oh  They're all turning around  I just thought the motorcade

[02:52:30]  The slow clap  Exactly  Maybe some nerds  Just saying  We are the champions  Yeah  We salute  The brave men and women  Who sacrificed so much  For our freedom  For freedom  And now I'm mocking  I like where the video's coming from  Of course  Like I like the intent of it  To honor veterans  Sure  I just  I didn't particularly love the video  But I love  I like where it's coming from  Yeah  Yeah 
[02:53:00]  The video itself  It meant well  A little hokey  Yeah I felt it was a little hokey  But I do like  You just sit there and watch  Like Band of Brothers  And you'll get the whole gist  Yeah I like the idea  Of I fought for you  I mean  You know  I want to know  How this white Republican  Won an election  By making believe  He was black  Didn't have the story  Yeah he didn't really make believe  He was black  But he  He led people to believe  But wasn't he in commercials  Or making appearances  How did he get this done  No not really 
[02:53:30]  Because the  The voting public  Are idiots  And he  But don't you want to see  A picture of who you're voting for  Well what he  He did it in a way  Like he said  Endorsed by  And it was  You know  It was the wording  Like please let  You know  This member of our community  And uh  Dave Wilson  He put a picture of  This  He said  Endorsed by  And he gave the name  Of a black politician  Right  But I think he also  Has a relative  Who's got that name  Yes  So it's a very fine print  At the bottom  He put you know  Like you know  Whatever the name was  Like Ron White  Is a relative  Is a distant cousin 
[02:54:00]  So he just you know  He technically didn't  Yeah  Let's see this  Here's the story  Yeah  That's a shocking win  For one candidate  In Tuesday's election  Listen to this  A white guy  Led voters  To believe  He was black  To win a seat  On the Houston  Community College Board  Here's what we hadn't  Heard before  And he's not denying  What he did  Our Doug Miller  Has more on this  Unusual campaign  On election night  As some candidates  Celebrated victory  Not many people noticed  A campaign shocker  Nobody was shocked 
[02:54:30]  More than me  The shocker  That's Dave Wilson  An anti-gay activist  And a sort of  Political mischief maker  Who put his name  On the ballot  I had always said  It was a long shot  No I didn't expect to win  Can I vote for you  He ran against this man  Houston Community College  Trustee Bruce Austin  Who voters have elected  And re-elected  For 24 years  Wow  I was rather disgusted  Disgusted by something  That turned up  In voters mailboxes  Most of the voters  In the district  Involved in this election  Are African American  Wilson sent out  A bunch of these 
[02:55:00]  Direct mail pieces  Implying that he's  African American  His flyers depicted  Smiling African American  Faces  The word said  Please vote for our  Friend and neighbor  Dave Wilson  The pictures he admits  Were just lifted  Off the internet  What a coincidence  The flyers said  He was endorsed  By Ron Wilson  No not the former  State representative  The fine print says  Ron Wilson  Is Dave Wilson's cousin  That's correct  We are  You really got a cousin  Named Ron Wilson 
[02:55:30]  Yeah  Okay  Edna and  Gene's boy  Yeah  Yeah  I really endorse you  Yeah  Yeah  I called him up  Bloomfield, Iowa  Yeah  In a heavy  African American district  Wilson won  By 26 votes  I don't think  It's good  I don't think  It's good  For both  Democracy  And the whole  Concept of fair play  But that was not  His intent  Apparently  Austin has said  He'll ask for a recount  But in an era  Of electronic voting  Political analysts 
[02:56:00]  Think Wilson's victory  Will hold  Despite his  Deliberately deceptive flyers  Doug Miller  K-H-O-U  He said  He'll work for our children  And had a bunch  Of little black children  Right  Shenanigans  Going on  In the community college system  If his victory holds  He'll serve on that board  For the next six years  Six years  That's great  The fact that he's  Kind of an anti-gay activist  Makes me hope he has a stroke  But aside from that  I like what he did  Is this his radio ad?  Yes  Oh, I gotta hear this  The one between 
[02:56:30]  Dave Wilson and Bruce Austin  Yes, that's the one  It's the strangest thing  That Bruce Austin  Voted against  $6 million in scholarships  For our children  Right here in our neighborhood  But he voted  Oh, I gotta hear this  I gotta hear the ad  Without the news guys  I know  I love the ad  It's annoying  It's pretty good  It's really good  Right here in our neighborhood  That's a bit misleading there  Yeah  A little bit 
[02:57:00]  I pretended I was in  Black once  Did you?  Yeah  I could be keeping up  With HCC District 2 race  The one between  Dave Wilson and Bruce Austin  Yes, that's the one  It's the strangest thing  That Bruce Austin  Voted against  $6 million in scholarships  For our children  Right here in our neighborhood  But he voted  To spend $45 million  In the foreign country  Of Qatar  And that doesn't include  The millions of dollars  He spent in Vietnam  Brazil  And Saudi Arabia 
[02:57:30]  Bruce Austin  Is killing the hopes  And dreams of  Our children  He's setting them up  For failure  Girl, please  I bet he has relatives  That could have used  Some of that scholarship money  He voted against  I've had about enough of him  So what are we gonna do?  I'm voting for Dave Wilson  Dave Wilson  Isn't he the  Yes, Dave Wilson  Is the man  Who's fighting  For our neighborhoods  He's the only one  In this race  For HCC District 2 trustee  That we can trust  We can't afford  An HCC District 2 trustee  Who has turned his back  On our neighborhoods  Holy shit  Sending millions overseas 
[02:58:00]  As bad as our children  Need help going to school  Bruce Austin  Ought to be ashamed  Paid for by Dave Wilson  For HCC District 2 campaign  It's a dig  Because there's a bunch  Of black people  Doing his fucking ass  It's hilarious  And they hinted  Isn't he the  Isn't he that  Fucking crack ass  Pick a wood  Yeah  Dave Wilson  That motherfucking  Hoggy white ass  Crack of wood  Pick a fucking  Dave Wilson  Is pretty smart  And totally unapologetic  Good  These are all black people 
[02:58:30]  Well, will you look at that  And I said  Lord  He's a white man  Right  Six years  They're stuck with him  He gonna help me  I got bronchitis  He might get some things done  Maybe  And now  The most ridiculous  Story of the day  There's a bill  Out there in California  They're drafting this bill  Oh  Would mandate  Porn stars  To wear protective eyewear  Like goggles  During filming 
[02:59:00]  They're just trying to get  Porn out of California  It's far from  They're trying to destroy  The porn industry  In this free country  What happens if you get  Like some sperm in your eye  Well, there's the HIV transmission  The fact that these  Dummies are  You get sperm in your eye  You can get the HIV thing  That's the excuse  Get eye AIDS  That would be extremely rare, right?  I'm sure  For that to happen  Sure  But they're not gonna outlaw  Unprotected sex  Among people who don't get tested  Which is regular bar goers  Oh, yeah  A few outbreaks in the porn industry  Which considering the amount  Of fucking they do  There's a very, very low 
[02:59:30]  Amount of people with AIDS  And they're tested  And mandatory tested  And they do stop shooting  When there's a  Again, how about you go out  To people's lives  And you mandate  That they wear condoms  Oh, you can't do that  Of course you can't  But goggles  Gargles and porn films  That would rock  They all look like  Fucking Kareem  That would rock  They all won the championship  The champagne is being  Sprayed in their face  That would look silly  They're worried about  The bodily fluids  Obviously  Including the fecal matter  Ew 
[03:00:00]  What?  Fecal matter  Well, fecal matter in the eye  Can cause like  You know, eyeball strombosis  Which is  It's a blindness that happens  From fecal matter  Yeah  Yeah, why?  The bill also  Statewide performance  They want to prohibit  The performance  From ejaculating  Onto the genitals  Mouth or eyes  That's the best places  But require employers  To provide barrier protection  Eyewear as well  That's what you want  They're just trying to get porn out  That's all  They've had it with the porn 
[03:00:30]  That's it  Old shop goggles  Because they can't make money  Off it anymore, right?  Nah, but it's a moral issue  It's not anything about money  It's a moral issue  You think?  Yeah, without a doubt, yeah  It's demeaning to women  And we must  Get rid of it  And this is a year after  The condoms were mandated  Yeah  During filming of vaginal  And anal sex scenes  In Los Angeles  That makes it hot  I love a nice sexy condom scene  If I see a porn  And something's going on  And it looks good  And then you just see that condom 
[03:01:00]  It's like  Takes you right out of  Out  Out  Don't think of that shit  When you're watching  Some pornography  Miguel is freaked out  Over what we just  Talked about  With the Dave Wilson  Right?  Miguel  Oh, I see that  Yeah  He makes a good point  Does he?  I don't hear him talking  Miguel in Florida  Big Al  Hey  Oh, Big Al  Did you say Big Al?  I was wondering  What the hell  That was all about  Shit  How does Big Al  Turn into Miguel?  Who's on the phone? 
[03:01:30]  Is it Sal?  No, it's Nikki  Oh  Oh, the pig deer  Made a mistake  That's alright, deer  You do the best you can  That's okay  That's alright  The poor deer  Don't worry about it  She made a mistake  Why isn't Sal on the phone, Sal?  I don't know  Because Nikki is  The chair probably voted  What's Sal doing right now?  He's cutting up some audio  In the back  Yeah  We'll let her slide  Alright, Big Al  What do you got, buddy?  You know, that story  In Houston  How come no one's addressing 
[03:02:00]  The blatant racism  Of the entire community  They voted for this guy  Because they thought  He was black  And totally ignored the issue  Well, they don't  By the way  They don't know that  They don't  You can't  See, they're automatically  Assuming that they voted for him  Because they thought he was black  Like, they don't know that  Maybe they really liked  Where he stood on the issues, too  I think it was a black thing  Me, too  The incumbent was there  For 24 years  Yep  Wait, what's he called?  The incumbent was there  For 24 years 
[03:02:30]  Yeah, because he's a black guy  I'm gonna go out on a limb  And say that  Yeah, you know  You could see  It's just like Obama  Look at me  He's got a 91% approval rating  In the black community  Can they all be that stupid?  No  It's because he's black  So  I say  Vote white  Vote white  Okay, that's what  Your message was  Thank you  Thank you, sir  Alright, Miguel  See you later, Miguel  Well, listen  I mean, no surprise 
[03:03:00]  People vote for the dumbest reasons  A lot of times  Well  Popularity contests  They certainly do  I one-time voted  For someone who had  The cutest button nose  Aw  Yeah  I think blacks are  Very racist when they vote  Tell you the truth  So are white people  No  Not as racist as blacks  No  When you look at the fact  That 98% of blacks  That voted  Voted for Obama  That would leave you  To believe  That they voted  For him based on race 
[03:03:30]  Yeah, but isn't there  Part of that  That would say  They want to have  The first black president  Not that they would vote  For a black president  Every time  Had there been  Other black people  To vote for  Yeah  I believe they would  Though  I do  I just believe they would  Maybe  And white people  Obviously had to  Have voted for Obama  Because he couldn't  Get put over  With just the black vote  So they're willing  To compromise  As far as race goes  But black people  Very unwilling to compromise  Black people have been  Voting for white people  For centuries  Since they've been  Allowed to vote  In good old fair America 
[03:04:00]  They've been voting  For white people forever  Because there are  No black candidates  Well that's not  That's the system  That was put in place  The first black candidate  That comes up  And spoke well  They fucking  Ushered him right in there  But the system  Didn't allow for other candidates  For many many many years  Like if a system is stacked  So one way racially  When the race  That legitimately  Has not been allowed  To do things  Votes for one of their own  To get in  You can't look at them  And go  Oh look at those racists  Yeah I can 
[03:04:30]  You can but it's not  It's not a fair way to do it  I mean technically  Things have been happening  For as  If the same amount of  If people are  Before Obama  A hundred percent  Of white people  Were voting for white candidates  Yeah  All of them  No  I know some people  That voted for Jesse Jackson  When he was running  Okay  And Reverend Al Sharpton  That would be a very small percentage  You don't know any white people  That voted for him  I do  It was one of my friend's moms  I would fucking smack her in the face  See that's from 1984  And you still remember 
[03:05:00]  The one woman you know  That voted for him  Exactly  That's a bad example  Ronnie Reagan took that one  Yes he did  I'm just filling you in  On the news  Yeah  Everybody  Great spoiler alert  Reagan won  Maybe look at an election like that  Obviously it's you know  The guy has to fake that he's black  To get the black vote  He knew the deal  I mean he's also not a nice guy  Like  Whatever  He knew the deal though  He's probably not great for the job  He's an anti-gay activist  He's a douche  He might be good  He's probably not great 
[03:05:30]  Oh he's full of fudge  Thank you Jim  Finally somebody says it  I don't know if you should be  Bragging that you're an anti-gay activist  By the way  Exactly  Where it goes on the brochure  Not only is he anti-gay  But that's his cause  Like he  He wants to create awareness  For the anti-gay  There's nothing he wants less  Than one man's mouth on a cock  Yeah  That's what he worries about  In our country  To put it on the brochure though  That's rough  Let's say hi to Ryan in New York  Ryan  Hey good morning  Good morning Ryan 
[03:06:00]  Hey uh  I just  Turned the radio back on  I heard you made a call  No one cares  Oh  Yeah well  What'd you have for breakfast  Yeah  Not yet Jimmy  98% of all the blacks  Voted for Obama  That's what you said  So that means  Only 2% of them  Actually have a brain  Oh  Look out  Wow there's a talking point  It's a little edgy  I just  I think  I understand why people  Would vote  He looked pretty impressive  At the time sir  Yeah and he was also  It was a good show  And black people  He looked very impressive  Yeah 
[03:06:30]  Alright guys  And now black people  Looking at twice  The national average  Of unemployment  That's good  Yeah  Good job Obama  But I get why you would  Vote for a guy like that  If I lived in a place  Where the situation  Was reversed  I would absolutely  Vote for a white guy  To get the first white guy  Of course  You know  And you're voting  Based on skin color  That's great  Yeah but that's  That's the way America  That's what America  Has always done  How about a little  Candidate named  Adolf Hitler  There you go  But  You 
[03:07:00]  If there were just  Black presidents forever  Yeah  You'd vote for Hitler  Because he's white  But you would vote for Hitler  Because he's white  You'd vote for Hitler now  Oh boy  Yeah  Well  I don't know  Or the H word  It's amazing how  We can say Hitler  You can't say  Faggot on the radio  Or like on TV  But you can say Hitler  Hitler  Oh you can do skits  About it even  Yeah why isn't  Hitler the H word 
[03:07:30]  There's not much  Of a more offensive guy  Than Adolf Hitler  Nazi  But you can sing  His name on TV  That should be  The N word  Yeah  Nazi  You're a Nazi  Yeah  Alright  Hey it's Mapeka  You got anything  Over there Jimmy  Oh  I'm singing this song  I can't  Yeah I do  I have a bunch of stuff  On jimnorton.com  For my upcoming dates  I have Las Vegas  And San Diego  San Diego's New Year's Eve  And Las Vegas  Is December 27, 29 
[03:08:00]  So just go to the  Tour section of my website  The website's still  Being worked on  And you can link  To all tickets  Very cool  And you can see  The pictures  Of myself  I love those  Pictures that pop up  There's a bunch  Yeah but the weird  Order that they come up in  I have to  Because they're supposed  To be random  There's like 10 or 12  Different album covers  That come up with me  Or one of the characters  Superimposed on them  Yeah  Like the Sabbath  Sabotage one  Is probably my favorite  And that one doesn't  Come up a lot  Oh man  It'll come up enough  It hasn't 
[03:08:30]  It will  We just sit at home  Looking at your site  Yeah right  Where's that one  Didn't come up again  I've gone through a few  And like  It's got something to do  With the order  They're putting this  I'm going to have to  Switch the order around  Once in a while  To uh  Because that Sabotage one  Is really really  Coke Logic did a  Fucking amazing job  Right but what's the problem  He's a good guy  It's just the randomness  That they're coming up  Is uh  I don't care  Oh no  I want it to come up 
[03:09:00]  In a different one  Oh no  I don't care  See like there's  The Peter Kist one again  The Paul Stanley one again  Edgar as Paul Stanley  Me as Ozzy  Oh that's a good one  That's a great one  Yeah  Holding a dildo  And you can see  On the knuckles  Instead of Ozzy  This is Chip  Yeah  This is Chip  It's been  Worked on  But watch  Now one of the other ones  We'll see  As Chip comes up again  I don't care  And I would prefer  This Gene Simmons  Is on the Paul  I don't care  With a little comb over  Yeah  And the glasses 
[03:09:30]  I don't care  One more time  No  I don't care  I don't care  And I'm really not happy  With the fact that  I don't care  We hate you  I don't care  We hate you  The way they're supposed to  Yeah you know what  You might have a point  Because it didn't come up  Once there  He's still doing it  It's the same ones  I have a few videos  There's not many yet  They're working on  The video page  Oh Eddie Vedder  Nice  Why is Eddie Vedder  On your  On your 
[03:10:00]  On your website  Chip Chibberson  Meets Eddie Vedder  I didn't see this  You heard it  Yeah Eddie was a big  Fan of Chips  What  Did we play this  On the air  It happened  It happened here  What are you talking about  It's impressions  It's just people  Doing voices  Let me see  It's theater  Anthony's a left wing  Hollywood douchebag  No  No I'm talking  That's what I get  On my twitter feed  No matter what I write  About Christie  Or liking Nixon  Left wing  Liberal  No me  They always say  I'm like have you read  My feed 
[03:10:30]  I say  Just get the fuck  Out there  And vote  Mitch Romney  Get Obama  Out of here  That worked well  I've had it with him  Exactly  In January 1st  You'll all have it with him  When those taxes go up  Boy  Let me tell you  Tell us how you really feel  So if you are registered to vote  As a Republican  And you sit home  And don't vote  I'm going to be very angry with you  Get up  Take the fucking  Five minutes it'll take 
[03:11:00]  To go and cast your fucking vote  You have no pull  Please  Didn't work very well  You have no pull  None  And you know  You didn't think  Mitt Romney was going to win though  Did you  No I wanted him to  Yeah  That's a really long bit  But very funny  I do remember this  When Jim  So go to JimNorton.com  And check it out for yourself  There's a few  I gotta put  We're working on the video page  And certain  Nice  And the you know  Buying shit  There's only a couple of links right now  Right  But you're going to be able to buy  Signed stuff  And all that stuff will be fixed 
[03:11:30]  But I just figured I'd get this site up and running  Very cool  And I have a lot of photos on it  It works on the mobile site too  This guy did a good job  These fucking  You open it on the mobile site  And it fucking  Hey who's that  Rashad  What the fuck  We're going home now  Rashad Evans  We asked if he was going to be in today  Did we  Yeah  What's he doing out there  I don't know  He probably wants to come and say hi  Well what is he  Well wait a minute  What's he  What is he working on  I don't know  Roland's out there 
[03:12:00]  He's just kind of  I don't know  What's he doing  What's he doing  Yeah  What's he doing  He's waiting  He has five minutes  For what Shane  Yeah  Well I don't bring him in for five  Why  Why didn't he do our show today  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  Yeah  But we thought we were booked  We were supposed to be booked  Yes  We really did  Yes  Because we thought we were booked  Oh we're idiots  Because we thought we were booked  Are you serious  Yes  Rashad 
[03:12:30]  What's up Rashad  What's up  How are you brother  I'm good man  How you guys doing  We're doing alright man  It's been a long time  Yeah  Since we rock and roll  So what are you going to fight  Yeah  What are you going to fight  Fuck you look in shape brother  You look trim  I am in shape man  I've been  Holy fuck  I've been training hard  When do you fight  Saturday  Who are you fighting  Chael Sonnen  I fight Chael Sonnen  In Vegas  The UFC 20th year anniversary 
[03:13:00]  GSP and Johnny Hendricks  Are the main event  So it's going to be  It's going to be a really good card  Yeah  Chael's doing better at light heavyweight  Than I expect him to  He beats  That was a show gun  He beats  Pretty well  Yeah  It was really surprising  Because  Shogun's training with Freddie Roach  And you think  That he's going to get  His hands are a lot better  He actually was looking good  But then he got caught  In the thing  That you didn't really think  He was going to get caught in  And that was a  Guillotine submission  Right  Yeah  So he's fucking  I'm surprised  Some guys move up in weight  I'm like 
[03:13:30]  Yeah they're going to get killed  Because they're fighting heavier  But I guess it's easier  You don't have to  Fucking shred the weight as much  See that's one thing  That a lot of people  Don't really understand  People are like  Oh you should drop down to 185  But when you drop down in weight  You're losing a lot  Like people think  I'm going to get stronger  When I drop down to weight  But you're losing  You're losing your speed  Because the guy's going to be  A little bit faster  And you're actually losing  A little bit of strength  Because when you have to  Drop down and cut so much weight  You're depleting yourself  On a cellular level  And that takes longer  Than 24 hours to replenish  You know  And a lot of people 
[03:14:00]  Just don't really understand  The science behind  When you take so much  Out of your body  Because when you got to  Make weight  It's not for the faint of hearts  At all  You know  We're really depleting  Our body  And just hitting a nose dive  And then trying to  Rise back up  Within 24 hours  How many pounds  Do you lose in a day  If you have to  To make weight  The most I ever lost  In one day  Was 15 pounds  How the fuck  That's crazy  And a lot of you guys  Will not discuss  How you do that  Because it's some kind  Of big top secret shit  Who did we ask recently  And they're like  Oh no  Chael 
[03:14:30]  Was it Chael  It was Chael or Jones  You're not going to get  Many guys that are going to tell you  No it's really  It's really  It's hard  You know  Because a lot of guys  They do  What they do  Sometimes  They sit in Epsom salt  They do Epsom salt baths  And that takes a lot out of you  And then a lot of guys  Do sauna  But it's a process  You know  Like when I lost 15 pounds  What I did  Is I started off  With a treadmill  I ran with a treadmill  I had my sweats on  Yeah but now you're  Tiring the shit  Out of your body  Exactly  Because how long  Do you have to run  On the treadmill  Man  I did about  A 40 minute run 
[03:15:00]  On a treadmill  When I was already depleted  Now I haven't already  I haven't at that point  Eaten in about  You know  Like two days  And then I go and run  And then  For 40 minutes  And after that  I go into the sauna  And then I do  These 20 minute sessions  In the sauna  And after the 20 minute sessions  Then I go  And then I hit up  The hot tub  In the Epsom salt bath  And then  It's almost like  It reminds me of a vacuum bag  You know those things  That suck all the air out  To show your clothes up  That's what you guys  Are doing to your body  You're like sucking 
[03:15:30]  Everything out  Like the moisture  Or whatever it is  And then you fucking  Pour it back in  The next day  And you know  You're 15 or 20 pounds  But your body is shot  Yes it's completely shot  And you gotta hope  It comes back fast  You gotta hope  It comes back really fast  I mean some guys  They do IVs  To kind of hydrate themselves  But at that point  Even if you do IV  And then you have  Like you know  Some goodies in a bag  For us like  You know  Like a Myers cocktail  It may try to come back  A little bit  But then still again  On a cellular level  You're still depleted  Forget about it  If you just have to 
[03:16:00]  Try to drink water  To replenish yourself  Because you're not  Going to make it  It doesn't even sound  Like it should be legal  Like if you weigh in  It's like  You know  It's like cheating  Yeah  I mean you see some guys  They're so good  And efficient  They can hit the nosedive  Not really take too much  On their body  Because their body  Has been used to it  And then next thing you know  They're like a 20 pounds  30 pounds heavier  So you guys are just  Taking 15 pounds out  Just to make weight  To put the 15 pounds back in  I couldn't do that  With two pounds  Right  No you'll be surprised 
[03:16:30]  How much you can lose  When you have to  You'll be surprised  But I'd like to take one  I'll probably be taking a sauna  You're probably going to lose  About a good 10 pounds today  You're probably right  I mean  Because I do have water  And just gunk weight  But it's a waste  Because you need the water  It'll go back on  Tomorrow  It just makes yourself  Look good for a day  Yeah exactly  I don't know  It'll look good  That's all you need  Some of the guys  Be looking so sucked out  At weigh-ins  It's like man  They look like skeletons  But I want to have abs  Like a UFC fighter 
[03:17:00]  And I just look at my abs  And I don't have them  I keep petering out  Like 150  I want to get down  To like 117  Is it 117?  No I want to be 140  You're looking good  You lost a lot of weight  Thank you  Yeah but I just can't get this part  That's the hardest part  To lose  The guts  It's the hardest part  That's the hardest part  Especially when you're  Eating fucking like  Peanut butter  It's really hard  To not eat shit  You guys eat healthy  Every 10 minutes  So I'm going to have  Some more nuts  And fucking you know  I don't know what to eat  After a workout  I'm always eating  The wrong things  One person tells you  That's good 
[03:17:30]  Like no no no  Have that  And then you talk  To a bodybuilder  No no  You're going to have carbs  Yeah you can't  But you can't listen  To a bodybuilder  They're crazy  When it comes to  The nutrition  They're absolutely nuts  They are right  They just want to bulk up  It's ridiculous  I mean their diet  Is crazy  That's the hardest part  About being a bodybuilder  Is the fact that  Their diet  Is just ridiculous  It's ridiculous  What do they got to eat a lot  I would gather  A lot  But it's like  Not really  It's not  It's like  Bland  Tasteless  Same meal  Over and over again  And they can't have this  It's just  Like the show 
[03:18:00]  A meat shake  Yeah  It's like  Bland  Tasteless  Same thing over and over  They eat so  They eat so much  But it's not even  Enjoyable food  It's like  It becomes a job  For them just to sit  And eat  Because it's so monotonous  And boring  And disgusting  What do they do  They eat like  Edward Norton said  He had to eat meat shakes  Or some shit  Or drink meat shakes  Jesus  Forget about it  Forget about it  I don't want to be in shape  That bad  How's your uncle doing?

I wanted to get him back  When he got old  Actually I did  I boxed him one time  And I got the better of him  And then he had  Like he got dizzy  And almost had to stop  And then he's like  You know what?  You know what?  You got this time  But I'm going to tell you right now  I did it to myself  I did it to myself  I'm the one who did it  And he couldn't admit  The fact that  You know I even got him  So it wasn't as sweet  As I hoped it would be  But now when I bring it up  He's like

[03:26:00]  The Opie and Anthony show continues  Sort of  After Opie and Anthony Live  With Sam Roberts  Is next  This  Is after Opie and Anthony Live  Here's your host  Sam Roberts  If you had told me  When I woke up this morning  That I would spend this much time  Today  Talking about ABBA  I would have stayed in bed 
[03:26:30]  I understand  That ABBA  Was a very successful  Band  In the 70's  But that's even more  To the point of like  Who on earth would listen to that  For entertainment?  Roland  Did you ever go through  An ABBA stage?  I guess we're all too young  To have ever actually gone through  An ABBA stage  Without there being  Some kind of irony  I just took my mom  To see Mamma Mia  That's the first time  I found out 
[03:27:00]  That was ABBA  Yeah  I didn't know who they were  Right  Like you kind of know  That song Dancing Queen  Yeah  I thought  Oh it's this  And I was like  Oh I love ABBA  I was like  Oh I guess there's  The play about them  Yeah you're going  What?  Yeah  It was an okay play  Yeah I mean  Everybody knows the songs  And I guess they're catchy  But it's like  To be talking about ABBA  And not even  In a silly way  To kind of be going over ABBA  And being like  Yeah that's a pretty good song  It's like  What are we doing here?  That's the Swedish people man  Sal do you 
[03:27:30]  Do you like ABBA?  He was singing back there  Okay I just didn't know  I wasn't singing  You were singing  The Dancing Queen  You were punching me  In the office  All fucking morning  Eric did you  Why were you punching Sal?  Just fall asleep  Roland Trayvon's me  Every once in a while  I don't know  You know what  You've said enough  Like in order to protect Roland  I'm going to ask  No follow up questions  But Roland you owe me  At least five lunches  Because that right there  Was it without  No follow up questions Roland  I got you  I don't know  No follow up questions  No no no 
[03:28:00]  I don't want any more details  About it  I got your back buddy  Roland said starting today  Eric  Did you ever  Your parent  You strike me  As a type of person  Who would have parents  That liked ABBA  That would be correct  I knew it  I knew that  Mama and Papa Nagel  Loved ABBA  No one of them does  Who your mom?  My dad  What?  That one I didn't see coming  When did you realize  That having a dad  That liked ABBA  Is questionable  When I started realizing 
[03:28:30]  I could listen to music  That wasn't my parents  So as a kid  I guess  You're right  Like when I was a kid  I thought it was  Only country music  Music was just country  If it wasn't  You know  Willie Nelson  Yeah  It doesn't exist  And then you start exploring  My first album  Was Permanent Vacation  By Aerosmith  That's a great album  It's a great album  But you start exploring  And you realize  There's all this music  Out there  That you're allowed  To listen to  So you're telling me  That growing up  You were like  Well  I guess  When you're a kid  You play with toys 
[03:29:00]  You get a little older  You start listening to music  And that sounds like ABBA  Is that what it was for you?  No  It was my dad  With their tapes  In his car  Playing them over and over  Wow  What would your mom think  About the fact that  Your dad listened to ABBA  Like that?  My mom hates  My dad's music  Well yeah  Obviously  He listens to ABBA  He wasn't sitting there  Going this is funny  No  He was serious about it  Which is why  What was his favorite song?  Which is why  My brother and myself  Both love this band  Love what band?  ABBA 
[03:29:30]  You love ABBA too?  Yeah  Oh my god Eric  Dude I wasn't playing  Like big hits  You were just  I was playing cuts  That I like  You were like  Finally it's my ABBA day  Deep cuts  What was your dad's  Favorite song?  That I don't know  I never asked him  What song did you hear  Did he sing along?  He used to  Because my dad used to  Play piano too  Yeah  So  I never knew you had  Some music in your family  Yeah I used to play piano  When I was a kid  I was going to say  I never knew you had  Dancing Queen  Where they drive past  Disney World  You think that's what  Was happening? 
[03:30:00]  Yeah  No Dancing Queen  Was never on  Friday night  And the brother  Did they do the backup scene?  No  Did you and your brother  Ever harmonize with your dad?  No  What about  For  Yeah what about  Waterloo?  Like  Harmonizing with it?  Yes  No  No  Okay  We didn't sing along with it  Alright  We were just in the car  All the time  So you never  Were like  Other boys don't have dads  That listen to this music?  I did  I realized when I was older 
[03:30:30]  Like you know  Maybe eight  Right  That I was like  Well you know what  My mom listens to like  The Beatles and the Monkees  And all those kind of things  From the 60s  And I wasn't hearing kids  Really listen to that  That's how you know  That it's bad  One of your mom's  Favorite bands  Is the Monkees  And she's the one  That listened to the cool music  In your house  Yeah my dad had  Well my dad had  A lot of different tastes  Cause there were certain  Artists that always played  Whenever we were in the car  If it wasn't on the  Oldie station  Abba  Who else? 
[03:31:00]  Abba  Elton John  Oh  Okay  ELO  You sure?  There's one or two others  That I can't think of  I would have  I would  I'm gonna tell you  Neil Diamond  I'm not gonna make any  Statements about your dad  Yeah  But if  My dad  Was sitting in the car  Listening to Abba  And Elton John  And music like that  Everywhere he goes  I would have some  Questions for him  Later in life  I would start  Questioning some things  That's all  Well  Well it's Frank  His best friend  That stays over  Yeah 
[03:31:30]  How come you always  Have your co-workers  Staying over  Any of that  Any good guy  Buddies that would  Stay over for the night  No never  Alright  Or fishing trips  I went to Rye  With no poles  Any fishing trips  No  Okay  Alright  He doesn't even  Talk to his family  Your dad does  Yeah  Your dad's just  A weird anti-social guy  Who listens to  Swedish dance music  Is that your dad  In a nutshell  Sure let's go with that  No wonder  No wonder Eric  So you're sitting there 
[03:32:00]  You've got to be  The pride and joy  Of this family  If this is where  You came from  No my dad did very well  He was in the music  Industry for a while  Really  And then he  Pretty much gave up  On music after  Lennon was shot  Like nothing good  Happened after  What was it  80  81  Yeah  Yeah  He was stuck in  Abba land  Yeah he was stuck  Back there  My god  Steve  Steve in DC  Hey what's going on  How are you  Hey I just want to  You know comment  Jim Norton is so great 
[03:32:30]  On your show  He's so funny  Yeah  Yeah  Do you have any idea  When Lucky Louie  Comes back on HBO  Probably never  I would assume  It's been years  And Louie's gone on  To another show  So my guess would be  Never  Oh wow  Really  Yeah  That kind of stuff  Hey I got one more question  Oh okay  Okay why are you  Such a rip off  Of the fucking  Howard Stern show  Wasn't he on today  Didn't you have  Anything to do  Yeah no I had  Plenty to do 
[03:33:00]  But you're such  A fucking rip off  You been drinking  A little this morning  No I have not  You slurred a little bit  Sounds like  Drunk to Archie Bunker  What what what  What  Slurred a little bit  Quinn in California  Hey  As long as you're  Looking for  Relevant Swedish music  Try a metal band  Called Sabaton  Well I'm sure  There's a lot of  Relevant metal  That's going on  In Sweden  I just don't know  If  It's weird  If ABBA  Was the way to go  It's weird  The spectrum  Of Swedish music  It's either  ABBA  Or black death metal  Now I feel like 
[03:33:30]  Everything  Maybe that was  A response  Like everybody  Realized that in  America  The most popular  Swedish band  Is ABBA  So everybody  Over there  Gave up  On dance music  They said that  Bullshit  Cannot signify  Our country  Anymore  You know  And they said  We have to  Move past that  And just create  The most ridiculous  Death metal  Larry in New Jersey  Hollywood  Prime time  Sammy Sweetheart  The F and Roberts  Professional broadcaster 
[03:34:00]  World renowned  Professional wrestling expert  That's right  Of the blatantly stolen  Lonely Virgil concept  That's right  I was not going to say  A word about Howard Stern  I wasn't even thinking  About it  Don't worry about him  On the air  Let me tell you something  Sam  The boys are a problem  And the boys are a problem  Because people go on  Howard's show  And the interview  Seems like an interrogation  It's almost like a rape  Because he's fascinated  With their toilet habits  And their flatulence  As well as their sex lives  That's no good  And they come to your show 
[03:34:30]  And they come to  The boys' show  Preceding you  Yeah  And the green room  Is somebody's desk  If they want to sit  And eat a bite  A bagel  I don't know  I don't know anything  About what's going on  Over there  Please Sammy  And then they go  On the show  Yeah  It's a piece of shit studio  And guess what  They have a great time  Right  They laugh  They joke  And all of a sudden  Who wants to go back  To the other show  That's right  The boys are a problem  That's right  Now back to ABBA 
[03:35:00]  Sammy  They were a worldwide  Phenomenon  I was in Germany  In the mid 70's  And you couldn't go anywhere  Without hearing an ABBA song  Yeah I know  I'm not trying to say  That ABBA was never  A big deal  But the fact of the matter  Is today  It's 2013  And they're no longer  A worldwide phenomenon  And there is no way  That people are still  Enjoying that music  Without a hint  Of irony  Well I enjoy it  But I'm old and gray  So 
[03:35:30]  What song  Larry you're a truck driver  What are you listening to?  Well I'm  I rediscovered  The highway  I didn't think  I ever liked  New country  Because I like  The old old country  No I mean like  What by ABBA  Are you listening to?  Oh well  Whatever comes on  The channels  Whether it's 26  Or 25  Or  So fucking weird  Or 8  I don't look for it  If it's there  I listen to it  You know  It's one of those things  It's there  If you listen to it  It's there  And it's fine  It comes on  I don't change the channel 
[03:36:00]  You know  So weird Larry  Thank you  Very strange  I don't know  Dennis Falcone  Is coming in  Poppy  Poppy  Sal  I don't need you  Talking anymore  You almost got  Rolling fire today  Apparently  Apparently  He was giving me  The head shake  As in no no  It's like I'm saying  Something wrong  You were saying  Something about  ABBA  And how people  Can't be into it today  How could they?  It's ridiculous  A whole new generation  Discovered them  After the success  Of Mamma Mia  Yeah but Mamma Mia 
[03:36:30]  Is gone now  When I do parties  Dancing Queen  Is one of the  Must plays  At every party  Yeah but  Ask the Who Kid  I'm sure he plays it too  No I'm sure  Who Kid does not  Play Dancing Queen  And when people  Dance to that song now  It's ironic  They're like  Look how ridiculous  It is that we're  Dancing to this song  This is stupid  This is funny  Wait  You're overanalyzing  It's pop music  It's entertainment  You know why  It's not pop music  What does pop stand for?  Popular  Right  That song's not popular  Anymore  It still is 
[03:37:00]  It is not  Any generation  Knows that song  From 12 to 92  Dancing Queen  This generation  And the last like  Seven generations  All know that song  Is like this ironic  Why would anybody  Ever make this  This is ridiculous  You are just too hip  For the room  Is that right?  That's exactly  You're just being  Way too hip  He plays Last Dance too  Do you play Last Dance?  I was doing a party  Saturday night  And the people were  Your age group  Sal's age group  Young people  And I'm there  And I'm mixing Avicii  I'm trying to do

No I mean it was  Good looking young ladies there  You know some fashionable guys  Like you and Sal  As I you know  Referenced before  So you know looking at  They were in their  Late late teens  Early late 20s  Early 30s  And I'm thinking  Hey I gotta be hip  I gotta you know  Play some  Yeah that's what I would think  That you'd go in  Trying to do the Avicii  And the  I'm gonna do a little  And the electronic dance music  Yeah yeah  All this kooky kids  At the kooky music  The kids are listening to today  This is what I was looking for 
[03:39:00]  Go ahead  You know what the problem is Sal  You and I are surrounded  By too many people  That are of a certain age  At this point  Yeah I'm with you on that  You know  Coke Logic  Smart guy  And he designed a lot  Of the photoshops  That are on Jim Norton's website  Yeah that's so cool  Just texted me  And he's right  And this is exactly  What I'm saying  Go ahead  Dancing Queen  Is the same as  Baby Got Back  Now when you have a party  People are requesting  Baby Got Back  Right  It's a goof  Dennis is a nerd  People request  He added Dennis is a nerd  That's not my opinion  Okay  Although it is 
[03:39:30]  People are requesting  Those songs  As like  This is ridiculous  This is a goof  Like look  Look at us dancing  To this  They enjoy it  As if we enjoyed this  They do  Sal  They do  Can you see people  Your age  The Brooklyn crowd  Requesting songs  Like that  And then  But then dancing  And then  The enjoyment  That they're getting  Out of it  Is  Look at this  This is an absurd  Premise  We're dancing  To this music  Isn't that  The only  Conceivable reason 
[03:40:00]  They'd be dancing  To that  Even the most  Ironic  Asshole  Dick  Douchebag  Hipsters  Would not do that  Song  Hear that Dennis  You guys are way  You're overanalyzed  It's just music  It's just fun  You're at a party  It doesn't sound fun at all  You're at a party  Can I tell you something  The dance floor was packed  That's a good time  If I was at a party  I was on fire  And they were playing  Oh god  You were on what  Fire  I could only pray  That that was true  If I was at a party  Or a wedding  And I heard  Abba  And Bob Seger 
[03:40:30]  And  Baby Got Back  And who else  Probably Jesse's Girl  Jesse's Girl  Yeah  Bon Jovi  You played Paranoise  By the Dashboard Light  Without a doubt  The guy came up to me  Paradise by the Dashboard Light  The meatloaf song  The meatloaf song  The guy came up to me  He goes  Hey you gotta play that song  My uncle loves that song  Love by the Dashboard Light  So he was even younger  Out of the demo  He goes  You know that song  Love by the Dashboard Light  What's the demo anymore?

[03:42:30]  But  They're either nerds  Old  Or too ironic for their own good  Who do you think  Who do you think his demographic is  For the people he's DJing  He's DJing like  Old ironic nerds  You know from late teens  To you know  Early 60s  What was the exact event  Like what was it  Let me ask you this Dennis  Is it kids ages 8 to 80  That's what I like to hear  That's a big spectrum there  You're right it is  It was a 60th birthday party  It was a family party  There you go  There's your answer  It was a family party  Of course  Let me go to Psycho Bob 
[03:43:00]  Let me go to Psycho Bob  Because while we're talking about the spectrum  Dennis Falcone is in here  Psycho Bob  Hey Sam how you doing this morning  Good  Sam you're relying on sale  To back up your argument  You lose  That's a great point Psycho Bob  That's a  Dennis  But the good thing is  You got good people supporting you  There's no right or wrong  You know if I was doing a party for  Your group  Your hipsters  Yeah I would never  I wouldn't dare to go that way  First of all they're not hipsters  They're human beings  They're just people 
[03:43:30]  I wouldn't play anything older  Than maybe two years ago  For your crowd  Because you guys are  So on the cutting edge  We're trying to keep on  What's up  Okay fine  But you know what  No but you can play stuff  That's old  You can't berate people  Because they like something  You can berate  If somebody likes ABBA  I'll berate them for the rest of my life  Okay I will cyber bully somebody  If I find out that they like ABBA  Well I want tickets for that concert  If it does happen  ABBA  Yeah you can get them I'm sure  Actually it'll probably be a very popular concert  But  It will be  Yeah because there'll be a whole bunch of ironic nerds 
[03:44:00]  Who are old  Now  You can play old music  You know  I was at a wedding over the weekend  It was a band  It wasn't a DJ  Which immediately to me is a red flag  I don't like that  Okay  Because it's rare that you find a good wedding band  Okay  It's a lot easier to find a good wedding DJ  True  But this band was not bad  But they were playing  They were playing Elvis Presley  Nice  They played Suspicious Minds  That's a great song  Good song  A lot of Beatles covers  That's good  That's all good stuff  But they're not sitting there going 
[03:44:30]  Do  Do  Do  Do  Do  Do  Do  Do  Do  Do  Do  Do  Do  Do  Do  Do  Do  Little jitterbug.  Jitterbug.  Is that how that song goes?  No, I'm a little clapping, finger snapping.  Do you snap to it?  I snap to it.  Do you ever sing along?  No, I don't sing along.  Good.  I am a professional.  I'm a broadcast professional, so I don't do that.  Do you kick off your gig with hip to be square?  No.  No, I don't.  I do play quite a number of you with selections, though. 
[03:45:00]  I usually kick off the party with pink.  Let's get this party started.  You don't really do that, do you?  You've got to.  That just signifies it right there.  I'm coming out, so you better get this party started.  Yeah, or maybe a Black Eyed Peas.  I got a feeling.  Or, just to know, ooh, this is going to be.  Mazel tov.  I just love yelling Mazel tov over the microphone.  Oh, yeah.  You do.  You like that.  Who doesn't?  You like that.  You join in over the songs?  No, I say, let me hear you now.  You ever take a glass and say, put your glasses in the air.  It's a celebration, bitches. 
[03:45:30]  Ever do something like that?  I wouldn't do that.  Why not?  Because that's not right.  First of all, I don't work blue.  If you're going to start with a Black Eyed Peas song, why not start with,  let's get retarded in here?  Let's get it started.  I would play let's get it started.  You wouldn't play the retarded version?  No, no, no, no, no.  You know, that's the way the song was written.  Let's get retarded in here.  And you're saying, hey.  I think that's folklore.  And Eric, do you have the cut?  I don't know.  Yeah.  Dennis Falcone is here.  We're getting ready for a party. 
[03:46:00]  All you retards, get on the dance floor.  That's not nice.  Dennis, what are you doing?  That's right, retards.  Everybody.  Dennis.  Stop.  This isn't what I hired you for.  Hey, I'm just here for my retards.  No, that's not nice.  No, Dennis.  This isn't what we do.  I do take a playlist.  And more importantly, I take a do not playlist.  So if you were having your...  You ban songs?  If the bride and groomer is ever hiring me, I always say, make sure you give me a list of  songs you don't want played.  You know what I take? 
[03:46:30]  Invariably, it's all the songs Sam has mentioned, right?  And what happens, nine times out of ten, somebody will come up and say, hey, aren't you going  to play the cha-cha slide?  And I don't blow them off and say, no, we got that on the no playlist.  I say, okay, hold on.  Don't play that shit.  I go over to the bride and groomer and I say, hey, your lady over there has to play.  Yeah, okay, go ahead, play it.  Do you say everybody clap your hands and give out those little hand clapper things?  Enough of your inside DJ bullshit.  You know what I take?  A massive deuce all over your playlist.  That's what I take.  You got to go on.  You got to be different, Dennis. 
[03:47:00]  You got to get out there and play the Let's Get Retarded song.  No, no, no.  And get all your retards on the dance floor.  Give the people a good time and get paid.  Get that cushy.  Turn the fucking song on.  He likes his song.  I don't care what he likes.  He can listen on his iPod all day long.  He's in there shaking his groove thing, y'all.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I got to leave.  I'm sorry.  I got to go.  Because Eric's encouraging him.  No, no, no.  It has nothing to do with that.  I'll tell you the truth about E-Rock.  In his heart, he's the Abba-loving, you know, schlocky DJ guy. 
[03:47:30]  He wishes he could be Dennis.  But if Eric was DJing a party, he would never put on Abba.  Yeah, he fucking would.  I would bring E-Rock out with me in a second.  We'd work together great.  He'd be out there having a good time, blow off the guitars.  E-Rock would be the guy in that stupid plastic fedora.  You know, the shiny one that you can...  That would be him.  No, yeah, I have those.  I have them in felt also.  You do?  Yeah.  Just in case you want to get a little fun.  Yeah.  A little wild.  In case you want to really get retarded at a Dennis Falcone party, right?  I like hitting out the tropical necklaces, too, to the children.  The what?  The tropical necklaces, too.  Sounds horrible. 
[03:48:00]  What, Hawaiian lays?  Yes.  But for children, it's tropical necklaces.  So where'd you go, hey, any kids out here for me to lay?  It's Dennis Falcone getting retarded.  Let's get the conga line started.  That's where we hit bust a point next door.  You play this song for the kids?  No.  Do you yell out to suck my conga line to the audience?  Come on, Eric.  That's ridiculous.  Lady Trucker, save us from this absurdity.  Sam, is it true that you don't like ABBA because you were conceived to their music?  No, that is insane. 
[03:48:30]  I'm sure that my parents conceived me in a quiet environment, but...  In a quiet riot environment.  Yeah, that's right.  They were in a quiet riot concert, actually.  They were in a bathroom stall.  You know what song was playing when I was born, Dennis Falcone?  When I was coming down the birth canal, when I was exiting through my mother's vagina?  You know what song was playing on the radio?  Don't stop till you get enough?  No!  Don't stop!  Sam's not black.  What do you think my mom was listening to?  You think she was just tapping her toes?  She was named after the Sam song by Olivia Newton-John. 
[03:49:00]  Absolutely not.  There was a song called Sam.  How does it go?  Olivia Newton-John.  How does it go?  It's a ballad, Sam.  I'm not going to sing it, but I'm sure E-Rock could find it right now.  I don't want E-Rock to find it.  You have a beautiful voice.  The song that was playing was You Pick to Find Time to Leave Me, Lucille, by Kenny Rogers.  Kenny Rogers, nice song.  That's right.  You like it?  Good tune, sure, yeah.  You like that song?  I like Kenny Rogers.  Of course you do.  The gambler, I like all his stuff.  Brandon in Washington.  Yeah, well, I'm 21 years old, and I fucking love all that music.  You love ABBA.  ABBA. 
[03:49:30]  All of it.  Oh, yeah.  What's your favorite ABBA song?  I don't know.  Okay, thank you, Brandon.  You see, sometimes, Dennis Falcone, all you have to do is get a few questions in before  you get to the truth.  He likes it all.  He maybe worships their whole catalog.  He celebrates their entire catalog.  John in Long Island.  Hey, man.  First time in Long Island.  What's up, buddy?  Hey.  Bubba Rui!  Bubba Rui, you fucking...  See what happens, Dennis?  Every once in a while, they slip through.  Hey, what are you going to do, buddy?

Closing time.  Well, there's a question for you on the phone.  Okay.  Justin in Ohio. 
[03:51:30]  Hey, Sammy.  I was just wondering if Denny can confirm or deny, based upon his speech pattern, I am  inferring that he is Bobo's father.  Okay.  Now, Dennis, you've been on the show for quite some time.  Bobo, another regular on the show.  Are you indeed the birth father?  No.  Of Daniel Bobo Curlin.  You are not Bobo's father?  No.  All right.  Have you tested?  No.  There's no need for a test.  Did you hear, speaking of Bobo and some of the more ridiculous characters on the show,  did you hear the Lady Di bit today? 
[03:52:00]  Yeah.  I caught bits and pieces of it.  Well, listen to this.  This is something...  Apparently, Lady Di is looking for love.  In all the wrong places.  Is that a song?  Looking for love in all the wrong places.  Air Supply, right?  What's that?  Is it Air Supply?  Looking for love is Johnny Lee.  Johnny Lee, Eric.  That was a no-brainer.  Urban cowboy.  Well, Lady Di...  I'm thinking of Lost in Love.  You're thinking of what?  A different song.  Yeah, I wish you would get Lost.  That's Air Supply.  He's right there.  He's good.  He's good.  He's good, right?  He's in the ballpark.  Look, Dennis, as long as Eric's in there having a good time, isn't that all that counts? 
[03:52:30]  He's fast on the trigger in there, so it's okay.  Fast on the what?  On the trigger.  I don't want that language.  What's wrong?  Trigger, you said.  Oh.  I jumped to conclusion.  This is Lady Di...  She's lost in love, is Lady Di's problem, as we mentioned, and she's looking for a man  in her life, so apparently she's applied to one of these video dating websites.  Have you seen these?  Yes, I've heard of them.  Well, check this out.  Welcome to Attainable Dating Solutions.  Video dating for the unwashed and socially inept. 
[03:53:00]  Profile FAT3039.  Lady Di.  Hey, my name is Lady Di.  From the retarded Laverne Shirley, the only thing I love more than the bottle is the  dick.  I'm looking for a man to go on a cruise with, okay?  A very nice, muscular man, has to be well-endowed, okay?  Am I doing all right so far?  Yeah, great, great.  Okay, and to have sex with on a balcony. 
[03:53:30]  For the right man, I'm willing to give oral on a balcony, even though it might be against  your instincts.  I'd prefer somebody to not throw me off the balcony and bend me over and give me the  old hee-ho.  I'm into the following things.  Water sports, ass play.  I'd be willing to experiment with toys.  Under the right circumstances, I would go both ways.  So feel free to bring a friend.  Call into the Opie and Anthony Show, 866-WOW-1-WOW.  That's 866-969-1969. 
[03:54:00]  And give me the ride of my life.  You think anybody's going to call back on that one?  100%.  Call the Opie and Anthony Show today.  Lady Di does.  So there you have it.  Lady Di's first foray into video dating.  Oh, good.  She's moving forward.  That's very exciting.  Did you hear her on the show on Friday?  Yeah, she's interesting.  You would never tweet out your phone number like that, would you?  No.  What is your phone number?  No.  It's on the air.  Okay, that was a test.  You passed.  You passed.  The other thing, I was a little, I don't know if I should be hurt by this. 
[03:54:30]  Dennis, you think that we're in the same club.  Dennis Falcone is in here.  And he thinks we're in the same club.  Distinctive Voices, is that what you call us?  Distinctive Voices.  Distinctive Voices.  Dennis told me a story.  True story.  He's going to get some gas.  Where were you?  I was out on Long Island.  I was doing the gig Saturday night.  A buddy of mine, I texted him.  Just playing ABBA and Baby Got Back for everybody.  Just having a good time.  I said, look, I'm rocking the house here.  I said, but once my gig is over at the ungodly hour of 10 o'clock, I said... 
[03:55:00]  You went till 10 p.m.?  Oh, yeah.  That's Eastern Standard Time?  Eastern Standard Time.  Incredible.  I said, what are you doing?  He goes, well, I'm not too far away in another venue.  Why don't you stop by?  I said, okay.  So I was trying to find the place.  Couldn't find it.  Right.  Drove into a gas station.  There was a young man there pumping gas.  I said, excuse me.  Where were you going to?  Just your friend's house?  No, the venue he was working at, the other place.  Oh, so you were going to try to get a little...  VFW or Knights of Columbus.  I forget what place it was.  You were going to try to get a couple bucks on the side?  I was just going to go over and say hi and hang out and whatever.  Help him have some fun with him.  Maybe grab the mic and just a little guest. 
[03:55:30]  See if you could jump into another party where you could yell out Mazel Tov.  Yeah, there you go.  Just have a little fun with him.  Love it.  So anyway, I asked the gentleman and I said, could you help me find this place?  And do you know where it is?  You're from around here.  And he said, hold on.  I'll look on the phone.  And he went to his iPhone and he was trying to find it.  I said, no, no, no.  You don't have to do that.  He goes, I know who you are.  He goes, I know who you are from the radio.  I said, huh?  And I wasn't wearing a hat or a SiriusXM sweatshirt or anything.  No swag.  No signage, nothing.  Wow.  And he goes, you're a daddy from Opie and Anthony.  He goes, I love you guys.  And you weren't driving the company van?  I wasn't driving the van.  Incredible.  I wasn't spinning the wheel of prizes or anything like that. 
[03:56:00]  And I just said, well, really?  I said, yeah.  I said, that's very good.  He goes, who else do you have in the van?  I said, well, I got Sam.  He's tied up in the back.  Is this the first time in your long, illustrious career in radio that you've been recognized  by voice alone?  Yeah, exactly.  That was very nice.  And this show is a very popular thing.  No, not this show.  The Opie and Anthony show is very popular.  This show is very popular, too.  I'm just kidding.  I was just wondering how you put that in there.  Yeah, no, I like that.  I like that you did that.  Distinctive voices.  But my problem is that you said, you'll like this, Sam, because you have a distinctive 
[03:56:30]  voice like me.  He would notice your voice, too.  Right.  But that makes me feel, and I don't want you to take this the wrong way.  I don't take anything you say the wrong way.  It makes me feel like I may end up being a failure.  No, I'm not a failure.  No, I didn't say you were.  No.  That's why I didn't want you to take it the wrong way.  No, I'm not.  But that I'd never really reach that brass ring.  Do you know what I mean?  That I'll kind of just be stagnant for quite some time.  No, I don't think that's true at all.  I just don't want that to happen to me.  It's just compared to voices.  That's it.  That's a career path or anything. 
[03:57:00]  No.  Okay, so I could have a totally different career path than you.  Oh, it could be worse.  What?  How?  I don't see how that's possible, Dennis.  I'm only kidding, Dennis.  I'm sure that your career will continue to flourish as it has, as will mine.  E-Rock's I'm not sure about, but I believe that one day E-Rock will be your apprentice.  E-Rock, would you apprentice being a party DJ with Dennis?  No.  No, we'd work together.  He's a good guy.  Why do you want to put him down all the time?  It's not a matter of, you apprentice so you can become great at something. 
[03:57:30]  He knows what to do.  At a party DJ.  Of course he does.  How many parties have you DJed, Eric?  I've assisted in some in college, but that was it.  He could do it.  He's a party animal.  I'd be yelling out of the band, E-Rock, get the hula hoops!  I love it.  Where's the limbo pole?  No!  That's not the one I want.  This sounds like a wild party.  And you're saying this went on until 10 p.m.?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  These people were exhausted.  And then you were ready for an after party.  I was ready to go, yeah.  I was ready to go at least till midnight.  You don't stop.  Well, here is hoping that... 
[03:58:00]  And you don't stop.  Yeah, and you don't.  Here's hoping our...  Even though we both have distinctive voices, our career paths will go in grossly different  directions at some point.  But until then, I'm happy to share this time with you.  Yes.  And thank you for stopping by.  Always enjoy being on this show.  Always enjoy having you.  Stay tuned.
