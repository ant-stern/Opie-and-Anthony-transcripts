<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about a hair found in a cake brought to the studio by Sam's mother.  The hosts and staff engaged in humorous speculation about its origin, ranging from pubic hair to nose hair, even suggesting sabotage.  Sam's mother was called on air, participating in the ensuing debate about the delicious cakes and her son's driving habits.  This segment also included discussions of Jim Norton's eating habits (including a cockroach incident), Opie's hygiene, and Opie dramatically pulling out his own pubic hair for comparison.  The "F.U. Line" segment featured angry and vulgar caller messages.  The show briefly touched upon an upcoming show with Jordan as a guest and Jim Norton's comedy project, "The Profiler".

The broadcast then shifted to a commemoration of the anniversaries of JFK's assassination and the release of Arlo Guthrie's "Alice's Restaurant," with a portion of the song being played.  The anniversary of the original Xbox's release and a discussion about the New York Islanders hockey team's poor performance followed.  A significant portion focused on Al Sharpton, playing audio clips of him using racial slurs and homophobic epithets.  The hosts debated the double standard surrounding his criticisms of others' language, touching upon censorship and free speech.  A caller, Stacy, engaged in a heated, often offensive, debate about African history and colonialism.  The discussion also included mentions of Don Imus and the Tawana Brawley case, along with a humorous skit about the Mayflower landing.  David Tell was confirmed as an in-studio guest, with Michael Starr also mentioned.

The next segment featured in-studio guest David Tell and a phone call with Jim Jefferies.  The conversation started with Tell’s meddling mother calling him about his voice, then shifted to Rich Voss's sick day, followed by a somber discussion about a friend's suicide shortly after his wedding.  Tell discussed his upcoming performances, including material about the Penn State scandal, and an upcoming comedy tour with Jim Norton.  Jefferies joined, discussing his New York performances, a new FX pilot, auditioning challenges, and experiences in Australian strip clubs.  Otto Peterson, a ventriloquist, called in, sharing crude anecdotes, including one about John Lennon.  Mike Starr joined to discuss his Redd Foxx biography, detailing Foxx's career, relationships (including his friendship with Malcolm X), and drug use.

A subsequent segment delved deeper into Redd Foxx's career, including his contract disputes with "Sanford and Son," his relationships with Norman Lear and Bud Yorkin, and anecdotes about his Vegas performances.  It also covered other Black comedians like Richard Pryor, Flip Wilson, and Moms Mabley.  This segment included a crude, offensive skit, “The First Thanksgiving,” with various cast members and sound effects.  Michael Starr, author of "The Red Fox Story: Black and Blue," was a guest in the studio.  The show ended with advertisements for upcoming events, including a strip club dance contest and Jim Norton's play.

The final segment discussed a Chick-fil-A lunch ordered for the staff, starting with jokes about carrot cake.  The conversation covered the difficulties of getting Chick-fil-A in NYC and Bobo's lunch at Dave & Buster's.  A large portion focused on hyperbolic threats against intern Matt, followed by discussions of the hosts' Chick-fil-A orders and dietary habits.  Eric detailed his salad consumption to appease his wife, leading to a discussion of his weight and dieting attempts.  Travis's substantial order and taquito consumption were also highlighted.  The segment concluded with a heated exchange between Sam and Troy about Sam’s on-air jokes and criticisms of staff members, with Troy suggesting bias.  Sam defended his approach, using Danny as an example of someone who often engages in the banter. The segment ended with advertisements for Steven Singer Jewelers and Trojan Condoms.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And now, and now, the moment you've all been patiently waiting for.  Today's O.P. and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:00:30]  Today's O.P. 
[00:01:00]  Today's O.P. 
[00:01:30]  Today's O.P.  Today's O.P. 
[00:02:00]  Today's O.P. 
[00:02:30]  Today's O.P. 
[00:03:00]  This is the O.P. and Anthony channel, XM 105, Sirius 206. 
[00:03:30]  And now, a show the likes of which America's never seen.  So appalling, so offensive, yet so entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  Beamed from satellites in space down to you every single day.  What planet are we living on?  It's the O.P. and Anthony show with O.P.  We're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up.  And Anthony. 
[00:04:00]  I live in a big house.  I make a lot of money and I fuck attractive girls.  And little Jimmy.  I don't even like an R opening.  I don't even like an R opening.  It sounds like a little...  What?  You get dang open and I don't listen to the dang open.  Stop with that shit.  I know.  Here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons?  I'm William Shatner, goddammit.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Alright, we'll see you next week. 
[00:04:30]  That was a great show.  A great show.  Happy Thanksgiving.  Why the fuck are we here?  Oh boy.  Paul's mother.  Thank you very much.  Oh no.  A few things going on.  Wow.  I think we're the only radio show live today.  We're stupid.  We're just stupid people.  We're just stupid.  You're stupid.  And then we got treats in front of us.  Ridiculously good treats.  Now, the question is, for people out there, whose mom made the treats? 
[00:05:00]  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Oh no.  Uh-oh.  It's not a curly one, is it?  Uh-oh.  I swear to God, I just pulled a curly off mine.  Ew.  Is it yours though?  Is it like a beard hair?  I don't know.  What color is it?  Wow.  Do some fucking genetic testing on that.  Can someone take this pubic hair and study it?  I want to know what color this is. 
[00:05:30]  It's hard to tell.  What do you think?  I don't know.  You're going to get grossed out though.  It kind of looks, uh...  That came right off the tree.  All right.  Let me see.  It kind of looks like it's...  It's your...  It kind of looks like your beard color.  My beard isn't that curly.  But it's not that curly.  And my beard isn't that long yet.  Could that be for my mustache?  No.  Maybe you scratched your pubis.  This is a pubic hair.  Maybe you scratched your pubis and it was under your fingernail.  No.  It came off the rolling pin. 
[00:06:00]  Is it gray?  No.  Oh.  I'm sorry.  Oh, this is ruining treat day.  There's an ass hair in the cake.  Who knows?  Someone put an ass hair in the cake.  And I just lost it, so...  There goes the sea...  Oh, Eric.  There it is.  It's on the paper.  Everybody seems very worried about it though.  Jim claimed there was an ass hair in the cake with a mouth full of cake. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, yeah.  I wouldn't care.  I wouldn't care if the asshole fell into the cake.  It's phenomenal.  There's a trade-off between goodness and an ass hair.  Let me tell you something.  When I'm at a restaurant, I'm that guy.  If I see a hair, I'll just pick it out.  Put it on the side and just keep eating.  What's that hair?  I figure as you go through life, there's other shit that is way worse than someone's...  That you never notice.  Someone's fucking nose hair in your soup.  You know what creeped me out one time?  I had fries and a roach crawled out from under my fries.  No fucking way.  That's happened to me twice. 
[00:07:00]  Once to a girlfriend I was with and once to me.  The hell you eating?  Dude, it was a regular diner.  No, that's impossible.  It was a diner.  A little roach crawled out from under the fries that I had been eating.  Oh, yeah.  Two times.  Once with a chicken.  Oh, fuck.  That's bad.  They crawl on the plate when they're probably sitting on a diner waiting for the people  picked up.  That would be it for me.  Under the heat lamp tanning?  Yeah.  Stupid roach.  I'll pick a spare hair off my food and keep eating.  Other people are like, oh, God.  And not only will they not ask for different food, they're done. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  They're done eating.  Push it away.  Ugh, I can't eat that.  No, they can't eat it at all.  I don't get those people.  Yeah, I don't give a shit.  Fuck that.  I'm hungry.  I'll handle it.  Hair, hair doesn't, an errant hair doesn't fuck me up that bad.  That's a pubic hair, Sam.  Well, then you stop putting pubic hair in your desserts.  Oh, boy.  That's not my pubic hair.  Yes, it is.  You scratch your balls and you pick up.  I didn't scratch my balls.  Oh, damn.  He's calling you a ball scratcher.  I didn't scratch my balls over there.  I've been known to pick a nose or two. 
[00:08:00]  That's a nose hair, then.  Pick a nose or two.  Pick a nose or two.  And I like to just kind of, like, touch the beard that's grown it.  Well, then I wonder where the hair could have come from.  It's not my beard hair, man.  It's not that long yet.  If you'd excuse me, Mr. Norton is sampling the carrot cake.  Yeah, how is the carrot cake?  Oh, my God.  Delish?  Sampling.  It's fucking shit's gone.  What the fuck?  I thought you were just eating the chocolate one.  Me, too.  It's going to be a bad morning. 
[00:08:30]  I'm eating cake for breakfast.  He's already slammed his second one.  Look at him.  I'm on the second one now.  What's wrong with you?  I'm hungry.  Three quarters of his carrot cake is gone already.  And I swear I thought he was still on the chocolate cake.  How do you not eat it when it comes to...  There's cake here.  It was a gift.  I had the chocolate the first thing, like, the second it got brought in.  And it's unbelievably good.  It's Bobby's cake.  Are you treating yourself?  I am today.  It's a holiday.  Yes.  That's right.  Well, no.  Today's Friday.  Today's Friday.  It's not a holiday.  It's Friday. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  Today is virtual Friday.  No, it's not like Friday.  It's Friday.  Well, it's...  Today is Friday.  I was saying that last night.  I'm like, well, tomorrow's Friday.  Look, everyone's staying on instant feedback.  TGIF, boys.  They get it, Sam.  You're losing the Friday thing.  Listen, enjoy it.  And I know you had Jim helping you out.  And guess what?  You both fucking lose.  Today's Friday.  Enjoy your Tuesday tapes.  Friday.  Yeah.  Friday.  Partying, partying.  Partying in the back, right?  Friday.  Yeah.  This is a big ad now, this song. 
[00:09:30]  Yes.  Cole's ad or something?  Yeah.  For Cole's.  People hate it.  They go, Black Friday, Black Friday.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Which I don't like.  I know why.  Well, because it interferes with...  I pulled some of the icing off.  People having fun on Thanksgiving.  Just to keep the calories down.  The icing is sugar-free.  Just a little bit.  A little bit.  Is it really?  No, it's not.  This thing is loaded with fucking sugar.  You got ready for a second one?  If that's the case. 
[00:10:00]  I don't care.  I'll eat the icing.  Jimmy's justifying this.  Yeah.  The icing is like icing on the cake.  Yeah.  Well, did you notice the icing carrots?  That we're all individually, you know, squeezed out?  Yeah, that's the act of a sociopath, by the way.  Oh, yeah.  To make icing carrots.  But the carrot cupcakes are amazing.  They're little...  It's white covering and there's little carrots on them.  Yes, little carrot.  Icing carrots that look exactly like little miniature carrots.  She was very... 
[00:10:30]  My mother was very paranoid about how I took care of the cakes after I brought them from  my house because she said the carrot cakes have to stay sealed and put in the fridge  right away and the chocolate cakes have to be out of the fridge and the top should be  on but not sealed so a little air can get through.  Why the air?  I have no idea.  I don't ask questions.  I'd love to know that.  Not to.  She'd probably cut a gasser on them.  Well, you know we got to call her to thank her for these treats.  I know it's early in the morning, Sam.  Yeah, I mean, she's asleep, I'm sure, right now. 
[00:11:00]  So we decided it's either ass hair, pube, nose hair from a nose or two, or from the back  of your fucking neck, I bet.  I bet, Sam, that's like a little short and curly from the back of your neck.  Could have been from my head, I guess.  Yeah.  I want to study this hair.  It looks like it.  Give me a...  I would need glasses.  I can't look at close things anymore.  It's really gross.  Well, it's probably from...  All fairness to Sam, in transporting the... 
[00:11:30]  Did you lose it?  No.  There it is.  You sure?  It's still right here.  We're handling it like it's fucking...  And yet half the staff already reaching over to get a cake, so it could have come from  a lot of different sources.  Okay, yeah, that's a...  Oh, boy.  Yeah, that's not good, right?  We need photographic evidence, yes.  Mm-hmm.  This could ruin your mom's baking career.  It really could.  She doesn't have a career.  This could be a health violation, Sam.  Because she wants to do something nice, and instead of accepting a nice treat, you have 
[00:12:00]  to make trouble again, OP.  How did I make trouble?  I pulled it off, the lovely chocolate treat, and I ate it.  It came from your balls.  It didn't come from my balls.  I didn't scratch my balls.  I'm sure you did.  And unfortunately, I got some...  Came from your balls.  Some red pubes down there.  You do.  It's okay for yours.  You go, oh, boy.  It's kind of like strawberry bonds.  Now I got...  It is.  Oh, I see.  Look at this.  Now we can blow it up.  Look, we can blow it up now.  Okay, that's not curly.  Are you tweeting that shit?  It is curly.  Oh, God, yes, it is.  It's in a fucking loop. 
[00:12:30]  It's one loop, though.  It looks like a cobra.  What do you want it to be?  A slinky?  It's fucking...  Yeah.  It's curly.  It's a cobra ready to strike, Sam.  My mom has very curly hair, like me.  And it's very thin.  This looks very pubic-like.  Look, Sam, I don't want to make trouble.  I'm saying this hair could have came from anywhere.  That's all.  Very pubic-like.  What color is the hair?  I don't know.  It's not strawberry blonde, and that's what I got sporting.  Because it could have come from Danny's beard as well.  No. 
[00:13:00]  Danny has long beard hair now, and he did get a cake.  No, it's kind of a...  I don't see a root.  Or is it too light?  This pubic hair looks like it's days away from turning gray.  Oh, God.  Wow, I mean...  It's ready to just lose all pigment.  It's fading fast.  What?  I'm just looking at the hair picture.  Yeah.  I'm not happy.  Jesus, Sam.  Yeah, you could really love it.  They're ruining your mom's bacon.  Say luck.  They're not ruining it.  They both already ate... 
[00:13:30]  Jim already ate two cakes, and Ann already ate one.  I'm two hairs in already.  Jim, are you going for three?  Yeah.  Definitely.  I don't want to be selfish.  I like when you tell everyone why you're treating yourself.  I love that.  Well, I'm only doing it because it's Thanksgiving week, and I feel that...  That's all?  I was in the gym the other day.  I love when you're just like, well, I had a good Leno appearance, so I'm treating myself.  I'm doing it to celebrate.  Harrisburg was great.  It really was.  I ate pretty well there.  Maybe this is a late...  Two sold-out shows?  Maybe this is a late celebration for the Harrisburg show. 
[00:14:00]  There wasn't, because you couldn't treat yourself after the Saturday shows because you...  Leaving Harrisburg.  That was treating yourself.  Sam, besides the pubic hair that could have came from your mom, these treats are delish.  Yeah.  I told you.  I said possibly.  Really?  I mean, it's stupid.  It didn't come from my mom.  I never indulge in the treats that are brought in.  Very rarely.  And they were literally on the table for nine seconds before you were saying, okay.  I saw that and was like, I had to have one of these wonderful chocolate cakeys. 
[00:14:30]  How about we...  How about Dan...  Danny pulls out a beard hair, and we'll compare.  And then find out?  Yeah, man.  And Travis could have been a beard hair from him.  No, this is a little long, man.  Could have been from his head.  Could have been from his...  No.  Or an arm hair, even.  He's got arm hair.  That's not arm hair.  It's too thick.  Travis has hairy arms.  It's too thick.  Okay.  Yeah.  Oh, nice. 
[00:15:00]  Forensics have decided it's a puke.  Well, then, oh, he was scratching his balls.  I didn't scratch my balls.  I believe you did.  And, you know, I got the type of hair color that it would be obvious if it was my puke hair.  Oh, really?  Not dark red, but, you know, there's blonde and red.  It's all over the fucking place.  A couple spare gray ones.  All right, anybody...  Danny, right here.  Is this your beard hair?  No.  I can see right now. 
[00:15:30]  It doesn't look like it.  No.  Okay.  No.  No way.  So Sam is acknowledging it doesn't belong to anybody on stage.  Oh, it's not Travis.  His beard is...  Stop.  It's curly.  His beard is too short.  It's a curly pube.  Yeah.  With an opiate scratching his balls before his cake.  Here's a close-up picture of it.  That's not even black.  It's like a lightish brown.  It's light.  Your mom has light brown hair.  See?  Like a strawberry bond.  That right there is short and curly.  Dude, you know what?  Look, it even has this little, like, that little hook on the end. 
[00:16:00]  It's like a plebe style.  It's a puke.  Oh, no.  What's he doing?  I'm going to pull a fucking...  Oh, God damn it.  Go ahead.  Grab one out of there.  Why don't you just go with one of the news stories or something?  What are we doing here?  See, you shouldn't challenge me, Sam.  There was no challenge.  You're plucking a pube out.  You keep saying it's my pube hair.  You brought this up.  I could never pull a pube out.  Could you?  What?  I'm trying to get...  Well, you shave all yours off.  Yeah, you don't have any.  If I did that right now, I would just be touching smooth skin.  Disgusting.  All right, I got one. 
[00:16:30]  You think maybe it was Eric sending a message?  Oh, God damn it.  Ah, Jesus.  Is Eric sending a message?  Yeah, maybe.  Oh, fuck!  Maybe E-Rock's angry.  Crab walked off his head.  All right.  Get out of here!  Maybe it's time to trim, I just realized.  Okay.  I don't think anyone wants to compare.  Sam, whatever.  Don't hold it over the cake!  It's whatever you say it is.  Whatever.  What are you doing?  What is your pube?  What do you think?  Oh, my God.  Jesus Christ.  Holy shit. 
[00:17:00]  So does that prove it's not a pube?  No, man.  It's not Opi's pube.  I got to trim my pubes, I just realized.  That's a little too long.  Why don't you do it at home, not at work?  It's supposed to be doing a show here.  All right, get rid of that.  It's supposed to be manscaping.  It looks like a fishhook.  Although it is nice to see what's at the bottom of that V.  Yeah, it really is.  I almost lost the original.  What the happy trail leads to.  I almost lost the original pube hair.  Holy shit.  Now what are you going to say, Sam?  No, I don't even know what to say.  You challenged me.  Look, there's my pube hair.  You started trouble again. 
[00:17:30]  And there's the one from the delicious treat.  Yeah.  This is definitely not Opi's pube.  But is it a pube?  Yes.  Not all my pubes are that long.  It is, definitely.  Holy shit.  They're not all that long.  Looks like it came off the Unabomber's beard.  I think we're forgetting about a potential suspect.  Yeah.  What about Jess?  Oh, yeah.  She could.  This could be a sabotage mission.  Oh, fuck.  I hope so.  Now is.  It's like, you know. 
[00:18:00]  I'm like, wait a minute.  This is intriguing.  All of a sudden the cake's got tastier.  You know, the pubic hair I just pulled out.  I think I could do locks with this.  You could pick locks with it.  I could pick locks with this one.  Now, would that ever come off of Jess?  Or is she, you know, more well-groomed than that?  Yeah, what is she doing?  Is it so long hair?  Yeah.  Anthony.  She shaves, right?  She's a young girl.  Oh, okay.  Pat from Burbank quickly writes, call a doctor.  Well, not that young.  Call a doctor quick. 
[00:18:30]  Maybe you can give Ann another plug.  Should we go to Sam's mom?  Well, she should be congratulated.  She's on hold already?  Yeah.  Who called her?  Sam's mom.  Why would you wake her up to put her on hold to listen to this nonsense?  Sam's mom?  Hello.  Hi.  Bobby.  Bobby, how are you?  We got your lovely treats just in time for the holiday.  Oh, good.  I'm so glad.  I hope you enjoy them. 
[00:19:00]  Well, Jimmy's already had two.  She just woke up.  You can hear it in her voice.  I've had a piece of the chocolate cake, which was stellar.  A piece?  You had a chocolate cake?  A chocolate cake.  Oh.  And then even I went right to the carrot cake after, which I even enjoyed even more.  I love them both, but one was even better than the other.  It's so good.  I rarely take parts in the treats this early in the morning.  Especially anything chocolate.  Yes, exactly.  I think we're all in agreement that...  I did like how the vanilla or the white icing was oppressing the dark cake.  That is true. 
[00:19:30]  But there was only down on the dark cake.  Covering it.  I think we're all in agreement that the treats are just over-the-top amazing.  But there is a problem.  There is a problem.  Are the treats better than Paul's mom's treats?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, they are, right?  I say yes, without a doubt.  Without a doubt.  You know, we're not really in competition with them.  Well, of course not.  Yeah, but if we said Paul's mom's were better, then we would hear you get very vicious.  Oh, no, I don't think so.  I think you did a great job, Sam's mom. 
[00:20:00]  Now, here's the problem.  I'm really glad.  I wanted to do that for you guys because you're so nice to me.  Well, we do have an issue.  Again, with the troublemaking.  I'm not a troublemaker, but we do have an issue.  And honestly, I'm not going to even blame Sam's mom.  I think Sam blew it as far as transporting the treats to our studio.  Maybe it came from a guy in the parking garage.  I so happened to pull one of the tasty chocolate cakes out, put it in front of me, 
[00:20:30]  and there was a hair on it.  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  She knows.  But let me tell you something, Sam's mom.  She does.  I'm a trooper.  I'm one of those guys, when I see a hair, I pull it off, put it to the side, and I eat.  Yeah, but you announce.  I don't give it back.  I don't fucking say I can't eat anything.  I'm all in.  But the problem is we're trying to figure out where this came from.  Yeah, you put it aside.  I just came on and heard you guys with the pube talk. 
[00:21:00]  Is that what you were talking about?  No, you know Sam.  He's going to defend you to the death.  And he was claiming that I, I can't believe I have to say this to you,  but he thinks I was scratching my balls before I reached in for the treats.  So Sam challenged me, so I pulled out a pubic hair to match it up with the one I found on the tree.  Yeah.  Opie spends a lot of time scratching, as you know, his crotch area.  I see, I see.  And it's, and safe to say, I got witnesses, my pubic hair is a lot longer than the hair we pulled off the treat. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  Apparently he hasn't shaved his pubes since Sam was an intern.  I don't, I don't think they're all that long.  Oh dude, it's, oh Jesus.  Oh, what are you doing?  Oh my God, not again.  Just check when you get home.  I, I Twittered comparable photos.  Comparable?  Of the, of the, of the, of the rolling pin pube hair we found and the long Opie pube hair.  The one that could pick a lock.  Yeah, it really is.  Jesus.  Awful.  It's like a hair tie. 
[00:22:00]  I'm really sorry if you guys, you know, found something like that.  Well.  But I think it got on there in the studio.  Well.  I did too.  Yeah, we're not, we're not going to, you know, officially claim that it came from you.  Well, I just want you to know that this happened, unfortunately.  And I think Sam, uh, somehow is involved.  Wait, does the hair look Puerto Rican?  Cause Mars is here.  Mars.  Did Mars touch any of the treats though?  I didn't even reach over and grab a cake. 
[00:22:30]  Well, you gotta, you gotta wait for all the white people to be done and then we'll.  And Mars' wife is.  We'll, we'll offer you one soon, Mars.  Made us cakes and we've never seen a hair on one of them.  Right.  So I wouldn't blame Mars right away.  Right.  Um, by the way, Matt, uh, Miss Robertson.  Can I say how much I, I love the, uh, the seasonal plate and napkin ensemble?  Yes.  I told her we have plates and napkins here and she insisted I bring these.  I don't blame her.  No, a true baker.  It's all about the presentation.  That's what I said.  Yes, it is. 
[00:23:00]  And, and we learned that you put the, uh, carrots on individually on each carrot cake.  The carrot icing.  Well, I had to make them first and then put them on.  Yeah.  You're quite the artist.  I gotta tell you.  I gotta tell you.  I'm stuck on.  Now you, you made those little carrot ones, right?  Yeah.  They're delicious.  Oh, thank you.  I'm glad you liked them.  You took so much time, much the way, like a serial killer will take the time with the  victim, slowly murdering them, meticulously.  I was thinking of you guys the whole time. 
[00:23:30]  I bet you she named each one.  Yeah.  Do you got names for your, uh...  She named after us scumbag, creep, troublemaker, asshole.  Oh, of course not.  And, uh, mistake.  Oh.  See, again with the troublemaker.  What?  Mistake.  Sorry.  That was more of a visual as I nodded towards Sam and said mistake.  Hey, why is that, yeah, why is that cupcake called traveling basketball player?  Um, so...  Globetrotter. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, yeah.  Well, I want to have the metal lark.  Your son came away with me this weekend.  He was very, very helpful.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I'm...  I think he enjoyed himself, Jimmy.  He did.  I think he had a good time.  He said your shows were really great.  Yes, I felt guilty, though, as we were driving.  I was texting, uh...  Oh, don't tell her this.  Driving very quickly.  Oh, yeah, no, Sam, Sam, I heard this yesterday.  Okay, I just wanted you to, in the spirit of honesty, I feel like you should know that 
[00:24:30]  I love Sam, but I was doing 90, sending my genitals to people.  Oh, genitals, yes.  Yeah, I don't think Sam should accompany you anymore.  Yeah, I do.  It wasn't like he was texting because he has a big, you know, thing happening in Hollywood.  He was texting his genitals at 90 miles an hour while your loved one was in the passenger's.  While your pride and joy was sitting there just trying to keep my eyes on the road.  You know, your only child.  Your little boy. 
[00:25:00]  Your only child.  Yeah, that's terrible.  I've been to your house.  Even though you have three officially, you only have one child.  What's that?  What's that?  Oh, sorry.  We didn't hear you, Bobby.  I'm glad I didn't know that was happening, and I hope it doesn't happen anymore.  And that's dangerous for you, too, Jimmy.  I know.  I think don't do that.  What I would probably do next time is probably I would say the dirty thing in Siri and then  have Sam go through my photos.  Yeah.  And I would have him choose which one I would like to say.  Which genital photo.  Yeah, I think we should do that next time. 
[00:25:30]  No.  It's safer, though.  No.  You know Sam's never going to be allowed to go with you again.  It's not a matter of being allowed.  No, because you'll tell your mom.  No, it's a whole thing.  Bobby likes the money, though.  You're not going to be allowed anymore.  She likes the fact that Sam got paid.  Yeah.  And for her, it's all about the money.  A little scratch.  And she also thinks it's a career advancement because you're in show business.  It's not just the money.  Wow.  Have you looked at my resume?  I'm one step above traveling with Voss. 
[00:26:00]  Well, we love your treats.  Sorry about the hair thing.  You're not sorry.  You brought it up.  Yeah.  I just felt like she should know that someone in the organization is not taking the baking  thing seriously.  I don't think it came from your mom.  I don't think so, either.  I think you mishandled the baked goods to the point that somebody's pubic had gone.  The carrot cakes are cold.  The chocolate cakes have some air going to them, like was said. 
[00:26:30]  Why do they have to leave a crack so air could get to them?  We've been wondering about that.  Because otherwise, the glaze will sort of ease into the chocolate.  It doesn't set up by itself.  And the chocolate cakes, then, are not as good.  How do you know that?  I don't know.  How did you figure that out?  Paul's mom would have just said, seal it up.  Throw it in the fridge.  Yeah.  She probably would have put it in a fucking, she probably would have got one of those  vacuum space seal things to suck the air out. 
[00:27:00]  Throw it in a bag.  She would have sent them in a sock.  Well, you see, the frosting is really soft, but that's cream cheese frosting on the carrot cake.  Yeah, it's delicious.  Oh, wow.  It really, I'm wondering if the icing should have been put on warm, though.  I'm just wondering.  Just a thought.  What?  She knows best.  I'm just wondering.  A cold cupcake with warm icing?  I don't know.  It's crazy.  Sometimes the combination of warm and cold can be nice. 
[00:27:30]  You don't even know what you're talking about anymore.  I'm just throwing that out there.  I don't know.  It's insane.  I like cold treats.  I like cold whipped cream.  Right.  Cold pudding.  Yeah.  Yeah, I like chilled treats.  Unless, like when you're having apple pie a la mode, or in my case, sweet potato pie.  Well, yes.  Sweet potato pie.  Do you make sweet potato pie, madam?  It's terrible.  You know, I've never made sweet potato pie.  That means it sucks.  Yeah, she just doesn't like black people.  She's made everything.  She didn't want them coming over for her pie.  Well, thank you very much. 
[00:28:00]  These are really, really stellar.  Wonderful.  Hey, really, I am sorry about the hair thing, but is that why you woke me up so early?  No, we wanted to thank you for the treats, Ann.  Yes.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Woke you up to make you feel good about yourself.  Right.  Oh, thank you, Dan.  That was very thoughtful of you.  She's very excited that she gets to host the Thanksgiving show.  Oh, that's great.  That is great.  Oh, that's right.  You get to hear Bobby all day Thursday.  That's right.  And your dad?  My dad will be here, too.  Oh, that's going to rock.  Oh, wow. 
[00:28:30]  What time are you doing it Thursday?  What about Thanksgiving?  What are they eating at Thanksgiving?  Well, we're recording it.  Oh, no.  We need them live.  They're not going to.  Yeah.  They're going to come here on Thanksgiving live after you call her up at six o'clock in  the morning and tell her there's a hair in the cake.  Why doesn't she just come up here and do it live?  Why not?  Why not?  Why not?  There's nothing better than live radio.  That's why we're here today, Sam.  We can put on a fucking best of, but we decided that people need a live show today.  So Wednesday, tomorrow, we're having a live show, Dan.  Oh, no.  We did our two.  Oh, we did our two days.  We did our two days. 
[00:29:00]  And to be honest with you, it's Friday, as we all know.  Yeah.  So we don't work on Saturdays.  Today's Tuesday.  Partying, partying.  Yeah.  That's right.  No, it's a mother's special, so it doesn't make sense for...  Yeah.  I mean, the listeners aren't going to know it's not live.  It's just intros into bits.  And they wouldn't be taking calls, anyway.  No.  Yeah.  No, probably better not, too.  They should take calls.  You don't have to worry about some spontaneous thing happening, either.  They should take calls, I'm thinking.  I'm not going to be, like, spontaneous.  No.  I would take calls if I were there live. 
[00:29:30]  Well, why don't you come in live?  You could bring your Thanksgiving dinner here.  There's plenty of counter space.  Oh, you guys...  Jordan's coming in to sing, too.  Yeah, you have somebody coming in Thursday.  She could answer the guy yesterday.  She was very worried about Jordan when I saw her last night.  She was worried?  She's very motherly.  Why?  Well, she doesn't want Jordan to show up to 178th in Amsterdam, as Mars called it, the  cocaine capital of the world.  Well, how does Mars know that, first of all?  Damn, that's a bad area. 
[00:30:00]  I was born in Washington Heights.  Oh, you were?  In that area?  Yeah, 187th and St. Nicholas.  Oh, that's close, I guess.  St. Nicholas.  Well, somebody on Twitter yesterday, I retweeted it, he Google mapped the address, and then  just tweeted a picture and said, the new home of Sirius, it made me laugh so fucking  hard, and I didn't feel like explaining it, but basically that's the address that Jordan,  the karaoke guy from the other day, is showing up because he thinks that's where the studio 
[00:30:30]  is located.  Yeah, there it is.  I fucking howled when this guy tweeted it yesterday.  Oh, boy.  That looks like a rough and tumble area.  Is that a bad area?  Oh, boy.  Not good, huh?  I don't know how you guys do that to people, and you sound like you're serious, and you're  like, you know, you're really like telling him to come here, and he may do that.  We're great liars.  Well, I was going to say, you know, I would like to think we're really good actors, but  the fact is, yeah, we're pretty serious about him.  We're hoping he shows up.  Uh-oh.  I got a tweet that makes some sense. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, no.  About the pubic hair?  Endless Surf made a great point.  It's probably one of Sam's special hairs mother saved for him in Tupperware.  Oh, no.  Did you use one of the Tupperware hairs?  A little hat do you do.  And she said, make sure Opie gets this one.  Oh, son of a bitch.  Or there's another possibility.  You know, she does save a lot of Sam's hair.  Maybe she puts an individual hair in every baked good.  In every single baked good.  To keep Sam alive forever. 
[00:31:30]  Yes, a little piece of her boy.  Like Jimmy said earlier, serial killer mentality going on here, so why not take one piece of  Sam's hair and put it in every baked good?  Mine, unfortunately, was on the surface, so...  You do realize that she would be a complete psychopath if she actually did that.  Because she wants her son to just continue, his energy to continue throughout time, throughout  DNA.  She's spreading Sam.  That would be the name of her biography, spreading Sam.  Plus, you'd have to...  You would put it in the batter.  You couldn't put it in each individual cake. 
[00:32:00]  Why not?  Maybe she forgot.  Why not?  All I'm thinking about is casino.  When De Niro's demanding there's an equal number of blueberries.  Equal number of blueberries.  Do you know how long that would take?  I love that guy's fucking reaction.  Oh, is he not happy?  She could take tweezers and individually put one hair into it and set it into the treat  before it cooks.  Yeah, she probably takes...  She doesn't want to waste all this hair.  That's right.  She probably takes one and cuts it. 
[00:32:30]  She probably has a little cutter.  Oh, my God.  And cuts it in sections.  So she has hair forever.  It's a little piece for each person.  Bobby, you didn't put Sam's hair in the baked goods, did you?  No.  I'm not kidding.  No.  No.  Don't make fun.  I'm not making fun.  It's endearing.  Oh.  Yeah.  We love Bobby.  Can't you tell Sam?  When are you going to figure this out?  She is like the quintessential mom.  That's right.  I'm surprised Jimmy came up with that serial killer thing. 
[00:33:00]  Well, I know.  Fair point, Miss Robertson.  It is...  Robertson.  Why do you keep calling her Robertson?  That's great.  No, my last name.  I forgot your last name.  But, you know, it was in a way complimentary.  It was...  And I know that I am the guy that would think of that.  But it was the meticulous attention you pay.  I was kind of tributing the detail.  I was saying that it really is a beautiful work. 
[00:33:30]  I'm not saying it was a born mental illness.  It's an amazingly well done product.  And everybody's had...  Anthony, he works out all the time.  He had a cake.  It's crazy.  Danny tries to watch what he eats.  He has energy wraps for records.  He had a cake.  We didn't have to.  It's holidays.  Jim's at the gym every other day.  And he had two cakes.  He deserves a treat.  Yes.  I treat myself.  Of course.  I've only got one treat.  Treat yourself.  Well, that's great.  I'm very flattered.  Thank you guys for trying out those things. 
[00:34:00]  And E-Rock hasn't been able to concentrate whatsoever on his job.  Oh, my God.  That's right.  What is he doing without having one?  No, there's drool all over the board.  All right.  It's disgusting.  Did E-Rock have one?  E-Rock, you want one?  No, I'm good.  Thank you.  But you asshole.  Oh, man.  Wow.  Son of a bitch.  No carrot cake?  Nah.  Why not?  Can we balance it on his nose and then tell him, go get it?  Why not?  It's really good.  I'm not a fan of carrot cake.  What about the chocolate cake?  I don't eat chocolate, so.  Do you really not eat chocolate?  No, we've talked about this plenty of times. 
[00:34:30]  I don't remember.  Who listens?  I don't either.  You're always surprised that there's food that I don't eat.  No, no.  I'm not surprised that there's food you don't eat.  Yeah, well.  I can see you're not eating celery or carrots or apples.  But, no, I'm surprised because chocolate's so good.  Unless they're held in a flat hand.  Sorry, I stepped on that.  It's okay.  Sorry, you have four hooves.  You couldn't help me.  But why don't you use the only chocolate?  Yeah, I'm not a really big fan of the taste of chocolate.  Wow.  Okay.  Wow.  Next time my mom will make two things of cupcakes and some sandwiches for you. 
[00:35:00]  That would be awesome.  Steak martini.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You don't actually have to do that, Mom.  I was just kidding.  Yeah, well, what is Iraq like?  Oh, boy.  What type of treats, Iraq?  How much time do you guys like?  A bison.  Who doesn't?  Get a fresh notebook.  This could take a while.  What does Iraq like?  About $4.  $4.50? 
[00:35:30]  Sorry.  What type of treats?  It's easier just to write down what he doesn't like.  Strawberry, vanilla, banana, peach.  You like peach treats?  Yeah.  But you know what chocolate?  Peach is good.  How about some peach cobbler?  Good peach cobbler.  This is Robertson.  Iraq, sure.  Peach cobbler.  What do you say?  I can do peach cobbler.  Oh, man.  Fuck yeah.  That's the next one.  Hold the pubes.  No, no, no.  Christmas cookies are next.  Christmas cookies.  Christmas cookies. 
[00:36:00]  They're dry.  She's known for her Christmas cookies.  They're crumbly.  I hate dry things.  She had another great point.  Edgar's mouth.  Another great point.  Bobby's serial killer.  This is off Vince and Jody on Twitter.  Bobby's serial killer name would be Mom of Sam.  Mom of Sam.  Make Christmas cookies.  Yeah, that's all right, man.  Sugar cookies.  Oh, I hate them.  They're too dry and crumbly.  You have them with some milk.  You dip them. 
[00:36:30]  No, you don't dip them.  I mean, it's called dunking.  Not dipping.  You don't dip it to you.  No one dips.  They dunk.  Fruit.  Dunking is for Oreos.  Dipping is for...  We don't know what dunking is.  It's dunking.  Dunking, I said.  Dunking.  You said dunking.  Dunking.  Dunking.  Where the fuck are you from?  Dunking's for blacks.  What the...  You dip?  Well, if it's a single cookie with no cream...  Bobby, what is it?  Dip or dunk?  Come on.  If it's two cookies with cream in the middle, that's a dunk because it's more substantial. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, that's true.  Thank you.  Of course.  You guys are always going to agree.  Do you ever disagree, you two?  No.  The mother always backs up young Sam.  Roberts have each other's backs.  Remember that.  Oh, God.  So gangster.  Do you two ever have conflict, ever?  I said have conflict about.  We're very intelligent people.  You're not.  Yeah.  There's something wrong if you're not conflicting every once in a while.  Sure.  Every now and then we'll have a spirited debate.  What was the last conflict you had with young Sam? 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  Messed his tighty.  Sometimes I have a little conflict because he doesn't like to take medication of any kind.  Oh.  That's right.  Straight edge.  Sometimes I think like, you know, he has an allergy.  He gets a cold.  You know, he should take like, you know, an Advil or something or an allergy thing.  She's from the old school, like, just take a pill.  Take a pill and I'm like, I don't want anything.  But you're missing something here. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  The last time my mom knew I had an allergy or I was sick.  Oh, please.  I was probably nine years old.  Exactly.  Because you're almost 30 and she still knows when you're sick.  Because she hears me on the air and anytime there's a slight sniffle in my voice, she goes,  Sam, you sound like you might be coming down with something on the air today.  She hears it in your voice.  She told me that yesterday.  She was like, you sound like you might have a cold on the air today.  And I said, I just didn't sleep.  So now she wants you to take some medication?  She would like, yeah.  You didn't sleep?  Take an Ambien.  Right.  I'll make Ambien cake for you. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, she could do that.  Oh, she likes that.  Yeah.  I don't do like sleeping pills and stuff like that.  No?  A little pot though, right, Bobby?  A little muscle relaxer there?  Well, before certain activities.  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Sam always wonders when he comes over on a Friday and there's like whiskey  and a few fucking painkillers laid out.  And the nitrate ploppers.  Yeah.  Certain DVDs are out on the table.  Oh, my God. 
[00:39:00]  Could that be a handlebar mustache hair?  That's what I've said before.  Yeah.  Maybe.  Could it be?  A mustache hair.  That curly part at the end.  It could have been, right?  I doubt it.  He was in the kitchen tasting everything.  Ah.  Tasting everything.  Who gets to lick the beaters?  Another great tweet coming in from a guy.  It's not even worth promoting your Twitter because it's too complicated.  But he writes,  E-Rock doesn't like carrot cake.  Does the carrot part put them off? 
[00:39:30]  Oh, is that what it is?  Yep.  Yep.  Boy, E-Rock's not getting any treats.  I know.  I can't believe two things and treats and he doesn't like them.  He'll have an extra big lunch today because he'll say to himself,  well, everybody had some cake and I didn't get any.  Oh, you delve into the mind of E-Rock.  He'll have a giant lunch.  Yeah.  And then an even larger dinner.  Bobby, you didn't put laxatives or anything in the treats, right?  I hope so.  Take a good dump. 
[00:40:00]  We've beat you up pretty good on the air.  I hope this isn't payback day.  Hey, trust me.  Oh, boy.  Oh, that didn't sound good.  No, not at all.  Let me put it this way.  I had some of the chocolate cake last night,  but the cake for you guys was in a separate container.  Why?  I don't know.  Interesting.  There was cake that she gave to the family and then there was cake for you guys.  Well, she wanted the best to go to us.  I think she's evil.  She's evil enough to do that.  Yeah.  She probably has like a little pill crusher with like little Tylenols in it.  That's how they caught the fucking, like the Excedrin killer or whatever. 
[00:40:30]  Because they had residue of the poison pills.  Yeah.  That's what's going on over the Roberts house.  She's slowly killing us.  How great would it be if there's pot in there?  Maybe she's, we all just start fucking losing our minds.  Oh, get all fucked up.  Yeah.  She wanted me to relapse.  Oh, yeah.  See, that would be cool.  Oh, Miss Robertson.  She's probably grinding up allergy medication and putting it into my cakes to make sure that  I get what I need.  Yeah, yeah.  Because you don't like taking any medication.  Bobby, are you one of those moms where you make your kids sick on purpose?  Oh, God, yeah.  What are they called again?  Munchausen.  Psychos.  Munchausen syndrome. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, Munchausen.  By proxy.  Are you one of those mothers to keep Sammy at home a little longer?  Yeah, did you ever put like Drano in Sam's soup while he was doing a little doll show?  My dad looked at her horrified when he found out.  I don't know why he's sick again.  Always here at the hospital.  She knows all the nurses' names.  I'll watch him.  I'll give him something.  She's injecting feces into his arm.  Oh, she doesn't like this conversation. 
[00:41:30]  No, this scenario is not good.  She doesn't like this one.  That hidden cam footage that catches him putting a pillow over his little face and he's leaning  on it and then loving him when he's taking his feet.  Yeah.  Oh, I had to revive him.  Oh, my God.  That didn't happen.  No?  I spent very little time in the hospital.  Yeah?  Very little time.  Good for you.  That is good.  Because Bobby takes care of you with good treats.  Oh, she did.  That's what happens when you're breastfeeding until you're 17 years old.  Oh, boy.  We went over this.  I wasn't breastfeeding. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  Damn it.  A long time.  Forgot about that part.  All right, Bobby.  We're going to let you go back to sleep.  Yeah, Bobby.  Thank you very much.  We really enjoyed the treats.  I'm glad.  Are we going to make it official and make her the baking champion?  She now takes the belt, yeah.  And the official baker of the O.B.  Yeah, you got the belt.  I feel good.  Yay.  I think it's only proper.  Paul's mom who?  Exactly.  We'll see if she decides to, you know, try to take the belt back.  She'll have to go to the store and buy more crusts.  Yeah.  Hey, Bobby, how come?  Store bought. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  How do you know rabbits eat carrots?  Because they don't wear glasses.  I'll get Paul's mom send things to me.  Mom, do you like Chip?  Just send some nice stuff for Christmas.  Do you like Chip?  Do I like Chips?  No.  I don't do it.  No, Chip.  Chip Chipperson.  I don't know.  She doesn't listen to the show enough.  She just listens to my part.  She takes it down when I'm not talking.  Is that a character that you do, son? 
[00:43:00]  Love?  Yeah, she actually has the father in the other room listening.  Whenever Sam talks, he's talking again.  She runs back and forth.  Should we let her go?  Yeah.  I think it's time for you guys to let her go.  She's busy.  All right, Bobby.  Thank you so much.  Busy lady.  Happy Thanksgiving.  And the same to all you guys.  And I'm sorry that I didn't say anything you rock like, but next time.  That's all right.  That's all right.  You can call him the sex man.  You're one of us.  Yeah.  That's what we call him. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, I don't know.  Great Thanksgiving.  I have nowhere to go Thanksgiving.  Look up recipes with krill.  Wow.  Jesus.  Oh, it always is.  Mom.  It just never fails.  Did you hear Jimmy?  What Jimmy just said?  What did he say?  He sadly said that he has no place to go for Thanksgiving.  Oh, well, Sam, bring him with you.  Oh, wow.  Imagine that.  Thanksgiving at the Roberts house.  It's got to be like a...  You would have a classic Thanksgiving over there. 
[00:44:00]  It would be Americana.  It would be, but I'm too full of shame to see those nice people on Thanksgiving.  Not the artist, the horrible vocalist.  Jesus, wow.  I always feel like someone is watching me.  A Rockwell painting.  This sucks.  Yeah, it's the black guy.  We'll play some Rockwell in a break.  Bobby, thank you.  Happy Thanksgiving.  Thank you, Bobby.  And Christmas cookies next.  I can't wait.  See you Thursday.  Thanks a lot, guys. 
[00:44:30]  Bye, Miss Robertson.  All right.  It's Robertson.  No, it's Robertson.  We all know that.  All right.  Cuckoo-ca-choo, Mrs. Robertson.  Something like that.  Something like that.  Yeah.  Something like that.  Oh.  Yeah.  Bobby?  Oh, yeah.  Emma, can I go now?  One other thing.  Oh, my God.  Listen, I'm not going to let them play.  You can't.  What they are going to do is try to keep you on the line as long as they can. 
[00:45:00]  So my advice to you would just be to hang up.  Oh.  Is she still there?  Bobby, I've got to ask you one more thing.  What?  Oh, my God.  Just hang up the phone.  Just hang up the phone.  He's going to keep asking you, saying that, and then you say, what is it?  And then he doesn't say anything.  That's the whole thing.  Is that the bit?  That's the whole thing.  For the bit.  For the show.  It's just being the karaoke guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly. 
[00:45:30]  I'll, um...  No, but, uh...  All right, listen, you guys.  Have a really great Thanksgiving.  Yeah.  All right.  Have a good one alone.  There'll be plenty of food.  Bobby.  I've really enjoyed those guys, and I'm glad you liked the treat.  Thank you so much for those.  Bobby?  Yeah.  You know...  She's too polite to hang up.  She knows what you're doing.  She's not dumb.  She's just far too polite.  She's not dumb. 
[00:46:00]  To hang up.  We know she's not dumb.  She's just old school.  Yeah.  She's got manners.  Like, Jordan was just so stupid.  Right.  But she can't hang up.  She's very polite.  She does not end a call like this.  She's a regular Emily Post.  Yeah.  Bobby, can I ask you one more thing, though?  Seriously.  No.  No, she said...  No!  That's it.  You can go.  I'll talk to you later.  Okay.  Okay.  Bye, guys.  Thanks for the cake cups. 
[00:46:30]  Bye.  Bye.  I guess we're going to enjoy Rockwell at...  Thank God she's...  At level two?  Yeah.  Jesus.  Turn this fucking up and go to break when you feel it.  Right?  I like the cake cup, too.  I'm going to eat.  That's a good one.  That's a good one.  Oh, okay. 
[00:47:00]  I don't know anymore of a neighbor's watching me.  Well, it's the mailman watching me.  And I don't feel safe anymore  Oh, what a mess  I wonder who's watching me now  The IRS  I always feel like  Somebody's watching me  And I have no privacy  I always feel like

[00:54:00]  You think we'll ever know  Yeah  Yes we do know  It was Oswald  It was Oswald  They really do  They've known since day one  Yeah  I do  It was him  And then we had to like  Kind of look at it for 48 years  To get back to the fact that he did it  No it's like Vincent  He said  The conspiracy guys have a better story  It's a more interesting story  Yeah  It's a fun story to explore  Yeah  Also 44 years ago today  Yeah  What happened  Oh boy  44  Yeah I just looked  Alice's restaurant 
[00:54:30]  You can get anything you want  At Alice's restaurant  Is David Hinkley writing a whole article on this  What radio station's playing it this year  Sure  Sure  That fucking radio hack  Wait till it comes around again  Oh that's right  He does say that right  Yeah  He says a little bit of everything  This song is called 
[00:55:00]  Alice's restaurant  How about you just start singing the song  And the restaurant  And the restaurant  But Alice's restaurant  Is not the name of the restaurant  That's just the name of the song  Why?  That's why I call the song Alice's restaurant  All right  You're not clever  Why were they laughing?  Yeah  Well they were on moods  Oh yeah  That's why I use them  Hit the audience  You can get anything you want  At Alice's restaurant 
[00:55:30]  It's kind of catchy  You can get anything you want  What was this?  1967?  Jesus  The nom was cranking  Oh yeah it was  You can get anything you want  At Alice's restaurant  All right  Bail on this thing  No this is good man  This is with all these things  Yeah  He talks it  How long is this song?  Six days  We have 17 minutes left 
[00:56:00]  17 minutes  I got it  Want to play it and then go to break?  Well we're not supposed to be here today  So why not?  Yeah  You want to know what else happened on this date?  A couple other good ones there  Yeah  That Xbox that we're all used to  Yeah  It's only six years old  I know  I thought it was  Six years today  I thought it was older than that  So did I  That means the Xbox came out  After we got back on radio  After our two year absence  Yeah  Thank God 
[00:56:30]  Huh  What would I do?  What would I play Call of Duty on?  Well that's just the 360  Yeah 360  The regular Xbox Live was older than that  Oh okay  God damn you're right  All right  I knew that didn't make sense  The Xbox 360 is six years old  It came out in 2001  Yeah okay  That was just stupid  The original Xbox  Original  Right  Xbox old school  Right okay  Yeah  What was I thinking?  Don't beat yourself up  Yeah  I gotta say this for the hockey fans  94 years ago today 
[00:57:00]  Hockey started  The NHL started  Oh boy  It's been one long season ever since  You don't like the hockey huh?  Not just long season  Crosby came back last night  For the Penguins  Oh  I thought it was Bing  To go beat his kids  This is important because he had a  Pretty serious head injury  And he had to sit out almost a year  10  10 and a half  11 months  10 and a half months I guess  And came back and played  A team I used to like a lot  The Islanders  And  Penguins beat the Islanders 5-0 
[00:57:30]  Crosby had two goals  Two assists  I mention that because the Islanders  Haven't really scored in about  Two and a half games now  Oh that's not good for winning a game  So Crosby  Has more goals  Than the entire Islander team  In the last  Two plus games  Damn  That's so stupid  Islanders second worst team in hockey  They stink  Yep  They sure do  Drive for five 
[00:58:00]  And people ask me  Every fucking day  I did not get my tickets this year  No  No  I was serious about that  Fuck those people  Why would you want to sit there  And watch that  Debacle  Debacle  I mean we're  We're in the middle of a lot of lean years  But I just don't think  The fucking team is  Heading in the right direction at all  They got a soft coach  A horrible GM  And an owner that  Knows nothing about hockey  Sounds like a winning combination  No shit  Patriots won last night 
[00:58:30]  Go Packets go  They got a two game lead  Over  Over the  Over my Jets  And  I think the Jets  And others  Huh?  I think the Jets are  Pretty much done  They play the Bills this weekend  A little Bills  Yeah they're done  No  Yeah?  No  No?  No  Well they got to win like every game or something  Yeah but they got a soft schedule  Soft schedule  They do have a soft schedule  Do they?  I think the remaining games  Not many 500 clubs  They got a soft schedule to the playoffs 
[00:59:00]  The thing is  Even the teams that are part of a soft schedule  They always wind up throwing a monkey wrench in there  When you get like  You know  One of those teams that's like  Oh wow  How'd they beat them  They're in last place  Well that's why they always say  On any given Sunday  Yes  Yes  On any given Sunday  You never know  Especially with football  You never know  Other sports you just know  You know  Yeah  I knew my owners  Had no fucking shot against the Penguins last night  You just know  That would have been a great game to bet 
[00:59:30]  But then you look at baseball  And like you know  Play a double header  You could split it  True  It's like why  If one team's better  Shouldn't it just win all the time  But they don't play only on Sundays  For the most part  So you can't say any given Sunday  Any given every day of the week  Any given Tuesday at 730  Exactly  Huge Islander fan  Want to help Opie out  No you don't need to help me out  I helped myself out  By not getting tickets this year  So I don't have to be all frustrated  And pissed off  I helped me  I helped myself 
[01:00:00]  I helped me  I changed  If they're not going to change  I change  That's what you learn in therapy  Rex Ryan says  He won't appeal  His $75,000 fucking fine  Me a bag of shells  You think it is?  For him?  Yeah  That's a tough nut  Me a bag of shells  That's a tough nut for  75 large  That's a lot of fucking money  Tax deductible is it?  Oh yeah  Or is it tax deductible  To the NFL  For putting it  Towards a charity  NFL just sucks 
[01:00:30]  I don't know why they do this  I just don't know why they do this  I think it's great for the game  If you got a fan  Like you know  Riling up a coach  And the coach  Says the F word  I love that stuff  I love it all  I don't think there should be  Unsportsmanlike conduct  Yeah  No I think  Allow it all  Yeah  Remember the old days  When we were growing up  When fucking  What's his name  Would sack the quarterback  And jump around like a lunatic  Gastineau  Gastineau  Mark Gastineau  All that shit  They took away from the game 
[01:01:00]  The New York sack exchange  Right  All the ridiculous  Touchdown dances and shit  Yeah  You know  Love all that  Yeah  Yeah  That's a thing of the past  Sportsmanship  Fuck that  They don't like that  Showboating anymore  If you're paying  Upwards of  Two to three hundred dollars  To go to a sporting event  You don't want to see  Sportsmanship  Ever  That's crazy  You don't  That's a lot of money  I don't get it  Ryan has to pay 75,000  That's unbelievable  And the fact is 
[01:01:30]  He was just  Minding his own business  I could see if he  Like aggressively  Went after somebody  Yeah  Unwarned  But he was  Minding his own business  Just walking to the  Locker room at halftime  And again  Just someone  Fucking jamming  Someone up  With those  God damn phones  Everyone's got their  Fucking phone out  To just catch someone  Doing something  So they could  Tattletale on him  And run to the media  Or post it  And show  What someone did bad  Right  We really have  Just gotten to the point 
[01:02:00]  Where it is kind of a  It's kind of a 1984 vibe  With the whole thing  Sure  It didn't pan out  The way it was supposed to  Where you physically  Went up and ratted  Someone out  Like you know  There's this supreme power  And you saw someone  Doing something  Practicing that evil  You know  Right  Speak  And then  And then you go  And rat him out  But you're virtually  Doing it  With the cell phone  Yep  You're posting it  Where the collective 
[01:02:30]  Can see it  And then  Someone gets in trouble  Well the person  That got cursed  A bunch of trustees  The person that got  Cursed out by Ryan  Wasn't affected by it  He wasn't bothered by that  The guy  I'm not sure if the guy  Who filmed it  Is the same guy  I'm not really sure  But everyone was laughing  They thought it was hilarious  So what's the problem  I would love the NFL  To tell me what the problem  Is there then  If no one was offended  By you know  Rex Ryan attacking  Back a little bit  Well it's their policy  It doesn't matter  If no one's offended  It's their policy 
[01:03:00]  They want it to be  Family oriented  That language has no place  In the NFL  Yeah  Oh really  Exactly  Really  I love when they  They're such hypocrites  They are terrible  The whole game  Is based on  Beating the living fuck  Out of the man  Across from you  On the line  Running as fast  As you can  At another human being  And trying to  Fucking knock  Their knees off  Right  Basically  Yet a fuck you  Is a problem  For the NFL  They don't like that  There's so much 
[01:03:30]  Violence in football  Even though they  Have done a good job  Cleaning it up  Yeah  Violence in football  Violence with the players  Outside of football  I think that would scare  That crap out of kids  Way more than a dumb curse  Yeah  When you see a guy  Landing on his head  That's horrifying to a kid  Not the F word  And then it goes back  To what you have said  Many many times  Over the years  And we're at this point  And you can't be the guy  That goes  Well we're gonna now  Allow the coaches  To say fuck you again  Yeah yeah  It never happens  You can't be that guy ever 
[01:04:00]  I've always said  Really take a good look  At what you're banning  Because you'll never  Ever bring it back  That's why you gotta  Always fight it  We've had this break  A million times  I understand  But it's worth repeating  That's why you gotta  Always fight this shit  Always  Because when it  Goes into place  You can never get it back  You never get it back  And the organization  That gets something  Put in place  Never disbands  They don't just go  Well we got that  Let's go home  Right right  Then they go for  The next thing  And the next thing  So you gotta hold them up 
[01:04:30]  As long as you can  On whatever they're trying  To get across  That fucks you up  Personally  Yeah  Your rights  Your pleasures  Your fucking  Privileges  Things like that  You opened my eyes  To that  Many years ago  It's fucking great  And we brought it up  With the fact that  Strip clubs used to be  Bottomless  On Long Island  Right  And then they  Some politician  Or something  Got in there  And said  Put some panties  On these fucking chicks  They could dance  Topless  But put some bottoms 
[01:05:00]  On them  Right  And then once  The bottoms go on  You'll never get  A politician  Whose platform is  To have the strippers  Take their panties  Back off  And be full bottomless  Right  It just isn't  Going to happen  So it will never happen  Well  It's a shame  I mean that  That's an outrageous  Example  But it makes our point  But more importantly  When they were trying  To ban the n-word  And Imus  With the nappy  Headed hoe  We were yelling  And screaming  On our show  Saying no  Everyone should be 
[01:05:30]  Against this  Because they're gonna  They're gonna go after  A million words  After this  They're not gonna  Just stop with  One dumb word  And look  Now you can't  Really say faggot  Anymore  No  You can't  There's a million  Retard  Retard you can't  Say anymore  There's a few more  I'm sure  I can't  The main ones  Are faggot  Nigger  Retard  And what was  There's at least  One more in there  Sex man  Sex man  Wasn't there another one  That's  What's the other push 
[01:06:00]  For another one  I'm trying to remember  Are we covering  All three of the major ones  Yeah but the problem is  They're not gonna  Stop there  You can't  Fuck with language  You can't  Ban words  In America  That's so stupid  That's just dumb  Yeah  But they've  Made it to where  These words are  Verboten  You can't  Fucking go around  Saying  I can't think of it  Off hand  You will lose your job  In certain  You know  Right we're not  Talking about  Broadcasting the words  We're talking about  People just walking around  Doing their thing  Yep  They could get in deep trouble 
[01:06:30]  For just saying those words  At the workplace  You could tweet it  You could get in trouble  For tweeting it  I honestly don't think  Anyone should get in trouble  For twitter  No matter what the fuck  They say  That should be  An open forum  For your own ideas  Unless of course  You're threatening  You know  People's lives  Right  But just in general  Conversation  Using words  If you want to use  The word retard  Or faggot  Or something like that  You should be able  To do it with impunity  It's  But you have this 
[01:07:00]  Fucking threat  Over your head  Of losing your livelihood  Yeah  Did you see the clip  That went around  I think last week  Reverend Al  From the Morton Downey  Was he angry?  Well the Morton Downey Jr.  Show  Oh wow  He was fat then  Yelling faggot  Oh really?  Reverend Al's yelling faggot?  And you look at this guy  Like really?  And you got  Imus fired over  Nappy Headed Ho  You understand this shit  And Nappy Headed Ho  Was meant as a joke that day  When you yelled faggot  You were really trying  To fucking hurt somebody  And it's not even  And you weren't using 
[01:07:30]  The word faggot  Like we did growing up  You were basically saying  This guy's a cocksucker  It wasn't even  Sharpton is the problem  It's the white people  Who buckle and listen to him  Yes  Reverend Al was so badass  There you go  You a punk faggot  And now he has a job  On MSNBC  Right  There you go  Yeah yeah  Now he's Mr. fucking  That's the guy  That we have to listen to now  See it's in  You a punk faggot  It's in his DNA  To say all this shit 
[01:08:00]  That drove me nuts  I know it's a long time ago  And maybe  Maybe you should let  Some of this shit go  But not if you're  The fucking leader  Of the movement  Not if you're having  People fired  Right  Yeah  Right  Not if you're having  People fired  Well for some reason  Al Sharpton  And Jesse Jackson  They've been able  To separate themselves  From who they used to be  Now it's like  Oh that was  And their excuses  Oh that was so long ago  Oh that  Oh I've done  Different things now  It's like  Yeah you did that  It's like fucking 
[01:08:30]  You know  David Duke  Yeah  How about  You allow David Duke  Then to be  Be a new person  And that whole  Ku Klux Klan thing  Bah that meant nothing  But you know  Reverend Al  Is now  An accepted  Member of  Politics  And talk radio  And television  You a punk faggot  Punk faggot  Can you picture  Any other  Wannabe presidential candidate  Yelling that  And not just being  Ridiculed by the media 
[01:09:00]  Forever  Right  But we all know  The difference  Between him and Jesse  And the other people  They criticize  And he loves  Throwing around the fact  That he ran for president  And I just shake my head  At the TV  Like you were  You were a joke  I was a presidential  Candidate  No you weren't  Yes I was  No you weren't  And I was fat  Now I'm thin  Dude  MSNBC  His show comes on at 6  Not even a fucking chance  I'm watching  No  And I used to watch  MSNBC here and there  His hair is furrowed  His furrowed brow 
[01:09:30]  Like a Klingon  I don't know  He scrunches up that forehead  I know they're in trouble  With ratings over there  Yeah  Reverend Al's not the guy  To get the job done  You dopes  You fucking dopes  I don't care how many years ago  He yelled it  The way this guy  Goes after people  Nobody should ever  Listen to him  No  And again  I don't blame him  He's just doing what  I would do in his position  Take whatever you can get  Blame Whitey  Or just you know  Use whatever power you have  It's the people  That listen to him  And E-Rock's got a whole disc 
[01:10:00]  Of this  They want you to say  What you just told me  Did he whisper  In your ass  Just get  On the air  We're all on the air  I don't give a fuck  We didn't want to interrupt  Interrupt  Figure out when to interrupt  And just go  That's what this whole show's about  I have some clips of  Reverend Al  Going off on Chinese and Koreans  Can we hear that?  White people in caves  Greek homos  And then calling David Dinkins  Greek homos  Greek homos  The N-word and a whore  Oh okay  Yeah we've played all these  He was calling him  He didn't call him the N-word  It's not what he said  He's an N-word 
[01:10:30]  Are you N-word?  Let's hear him  Alright here's the Chinese and Korean  We're the best chicken fries  In the universe  But we're going to want to buy  Some kind of sandwich  Then the Chapman  Come in and  Throw some hot pizza  And dip it down  And you stand out  And buy that  Korean  Sell us watermelon  We're going to eat watermelon  All our lives  But they're going to come  Cut it up  Put it in a bucket  With a rubber band around  And we're going to buy it 
[01:11:00]  Like it's something  We didn't know what it was  And nappy-headed hoe was bad  Korean sell his watermelon  Get the fuck out of here  You know what  Imus is dumb  All he should have done  Was play these clips  Over and over  And said  This is the guy  Who's coming after me  Passing judgment on me  And then  Somebody else would have  Piped up and said  It's not just Al  It's us too  You've got to call people out  On their hypocritical bullshit  Reverend Al got Imus fired  Period  And now here's the payback  They give him a show  On MSNBC down the line  I'm sorry I did that 
[01:11:30]  Yeah, Imus was kind of  We love the guy  He's kind of a father figure  In this business  But he fucking  Failed miserably  With that fucking situation  Oh man  I would have sat down  And had a radio show  With Reverend Al  With his daughter  Like with her arms  Crossed over his shoulder  You need to apologize  Well what about you  Apologize to gay people  For calling him a faggot  Didn't I  Didn't he want Imus  To apologize to his own daughter  Even though the daughter  Had nothing to do with it  Nothing to do with it  Yeah  As a black woman or something 
[01:12:00]  And Imus allowed this  God man  That was a bad week  Should have been  Should have been brutal  And he should have  Hit back really hard  And got these clips  And said that  The fact anybody  Would listen to this guy  Yeah, yeah  Very good  Wait, can we hear  The other one?  Yeah, let me hear  Some other ones  Alright, this is the  White people and  Greek homos  White folks was in the cave  When we had  Billions  Hold on, hold on  Pause that  White people were in caves  While we were building empires  This is some of the most 
[01:12:30]  Revisionist  Bullshit  History  Lies  And this  We need this sense of self-worth  That we were  We were something once  When white people  Weren't doing anything  But in caves  Eking and ooking  Sorry  Didn't fucking happen  Didn't fucking happen  There is no evidence  That any  Any fucking  Civilization  Was progressing 
[01:13:00]  In sub-Saharan  Fucking Africa  Ever  Until white  He got there  That's also  Nation of Islam stuff  The white people in caves  Who is it?  Dr. Jakob  I forget the name  Jakob Shmiernoff  They say that  The evil wicked doctor  Created white people  It's some weird story  That's just childish  Can we hear that again?  Because I want to quote it  Exactly on Twitter  Yeah, hang on  Here we go  White folks was in the cave  When we were building empires  While we were building empires?  Yeah  What the fuck  Are you talking about? 
[01:13:30]  Show me a wheel  Show me a fucking wheel  We built spaceships  We did?  Of course we did  Went to the moon  White people went to the moon  And white is on the moon  We didn't go to the moon  Whitey went to the moon  That was a Hollywood set  And you could go to Africa  Right now  And see people living  Like they lived in  Fucking caveman days  Why?  Why?  What happened?  What the fuck?  Figure out irrigation  So you're not starving  You dummies  You fucking idiots 
[01:14:00]  What's going on?  Fuck  Can't stand that revisionist shit  That Reverend Al  Just spouting bullshit  They were not building empires  They were selling each other  They were selling each other  Hacking each other apart  Because they're from a different tribe  Some fucking borders  That don't exist  Please  As white people  Are building ships  And exploring the fucking  The whole earth 
[01:14:30]  Enough for you  With your fake fucking empires  He drives me nuts  He's a lying sack of shite  Again  He is just doing  What he does  It's the fucking scumbags  That listen to him  It's those fucking  Pussy lawyers  And that's who the problem  Really is  Those are the guys  He's just  He's a dummy  And he's a shithead  I think he would have been  Easy to take down  In the Imus situation  Oh yeah  He has so much fucking fuel  I don't understand why  The Stephen Bagonis shit 
[01:15:00]  Folded  Maybe something was  Happening there  That we didn't know about  Because I couldn't believe  He had to sit there  And listen to his horse shit  It's all white people  Who have never  They don't have friends  Like Patrice and Keith  They don't know how to have  Racial discussions  Right  Or arguments with their friends  Right  Who they respect  Like they don't know  How to do that  Like you know how many times  I've argued with those  Dumbbells over race  And sometimes  I've thought they're crazy  And other times  I've thought  That's a fucking great point  And they've changed  The way I saw things  Like I tried to see things  From their perspective 
[01:15:30]  And they changed  The way I looked at something  Can't be a fighter  Unless you're sparring  That's the way  It really is though  It's like  And those guys are smart guys  You gotta spar a little bit  These guys never  Ever  Have those discussions  They have them  With other white people  And they're too afraid  To confront a black guy  On something they don't agree with  So they just  They just  They cave in  And yes  White people  Of course  Have killed each other  Over the years  In war  But let me tell you something  We've gotten well past  The machete  White people  When they kill each other 
[01:16:00]  Figure out better ways  To kill each other  See  Even killing each other  We figure out shit  It's amazing  Alright well  You wanna hear the rest of the clip  Oh yes  White folks  White folks  Was in the cave  When we had gun violence  We learned to admire them  But they knew to admire us  We built pyramids  Where Donald Trump  Ever knew architecture run  We taught philosophy  And astrology  And mathematics  Before Socrates 
[01:16:30]  And them Greek homos  Ever got around  And them Greek homos  Before Socrates  And them Greek homos  Ever got around to it  I'm tweeting all these  To Reverend Al by the way  I'm tweeting  I'm just tweeting his own quotes  Oh yeah good  Really  Teaching philosophy  And mathematics  What happened then  Where's the legacy of that  In a fucking 7-11  In a flash mob  In a 7-11  Is that the legacy  Of learning and teaching 
[01:17:00]  Mathematics and philosophy  Before them Greek homos  Yes the second homophobic thing  I'd like to know  Even though it's many many years ago  Why does GLAAD  Not object  To this guy having the voice he has  I would love to know why that is  Punk faggot  Punk faggot  And those Greek homos  You should tweet that clip  I already tweeted the quote  I'm just tweeting his quotes  Oh  The clip is fantastic  Oh  Fucking River now  Whatever man  But he shouldn't be the guy 
[01:17:30]  That should be telling us  What we are allowed to say  Why is he on MSNBC  I am  Why isn't he fired  For these statements  I don't get it  Do you want the last clip  About David Dinkins  Of course  Can we hear the Greek homos  One again  I'll make sure I got that right  You gotta court somebody accurate  Yes  Okay here  White folks was in the game  When we had billion pounds  We learned to admire them  But they knew to admire us  We built pyramids  Where Donald Trump  And a new architecture run  We taught philosophy 
[01:18:00]  And astrology  And mathematics  Before Socrates  And them Greek homos  Ever got around  You can't claim  North African  Technology  And architecture  To yourself  Because it's on the continent  As a black man  You cannot claim  The pyramids  No  It was built on the continent  Of Africa  But it's fucking worlds apart 
[01:18:30]  Those are Egyptians  They're kind of black though  No  Sorry  I think they were blacker  They are not African  Like you see  African Americans  That is a black person  The pyramids were built  By Egyptian people  Who are  More so  Middle Eastern  Than African  Do you think it was actually  A black man  What do you think  Those people looked like  Do you think they looked like 
[01:19:00]  Black men  Building the pyramids  Or do you think  They looked like  Egyptians look now  And Middle Eastern people  Building pyramids  I think they looked  More black  Than they look now  I don't think so  I do  I think the nose  Look that Sphinx nose  Was shot off  When you see the lips  On the Sphinx  It doesn't look  It doesn't look to me  I'm not saying  It necessarily looks like  An African  But it doesn't look  Like an Egyptian  Does look to me now  I think back  A couple thousand years ago  It may have been  A little bit  When you look at that Sphinx  That does not look 
[01:19:30]  Like a typical Egyptian guy  Oh  No no  But look at the Sphinx  And again  The nose was shot off  It just  I'm not saying  It looks like  You know  Oh shit  Let me see  When you look at  The pharaoh's faces  It's like Florida Evans  Looks like Sam  A little bit  Oh boy  Yes  Except the Sphinx's mother  Never put pubes  In cupcakes  And gave them to friends  If only that nose  Wasn't shot off  We'd know  You know what  That would really  I wonder if that's why  Some British soldier  Shot off 
[01:20:00]  The fuck is that  I think there is  A conspiracy about that  Yeah I've heard that  But you can't  Shoot the lips off  We gotta get rid of the nose  Yeah  Well there you go  With the Reverend Al  Right  One more Dinkins quote  Do you want the Dinkins quote  Oh yeah  Sure  That one  David  Yes  You wanna be the only nigga  On television  The only nigga  In the news  The only nigga  To talk  Don't cover them  Don't talk them  Cause you got  The only nigga  Problem  Cause you know  If a black man  Stood up next to you 
[01:20:30]  They would see you  For the whore  That you really are  Four times  Wow  He called Dinkins a nigger  Wow  Four times  Wow  Four times  Can everybody  And nappy headed ho  Got fucking  I am inspired  Nappy headed ho is too bad  But he called the mayor  The black mayor  Digger four times  He's allowed to  Cause he's black  Phony  Cocksucker  Yeah  He's the worst  What a fucking asshole  He is  He's the fucking worst  He knows his past  Phony  And then he goes after 
[01:21:00]  The uh  God  We will never let  The nappy headed ho  Thing go  It's been years  And I understand that  Probably people like  This again  But yeah  It's kind of  Fucking important  But everybody deals  With this shit  On their jobs  Because even though  You guys aren't  Getting fired  Like radio guys  Everyone hearing this  You can't tell  Certain jokes anymore  At work  You can't  You can't  You get fired  For certain  Tasteless emails  And it's all  This mentality  It's pieces of shit  Like Sharpton  Who say one thing  In their lives  And practice one thing 
[01:21:30]  And then come after you  And get you in trouble  And that's the whole  Mentality behind  Getting people  In trouble  For that type of humor  And radio was in trouble  But the nappy headed ho  Was the death knell man  They got rid of a lot  Of edgy radio shows  After that  A lot  People were petrified  So many guys  Are out of work  Holding them hostage  Because these radio companies  Are way too scared  To hire anyone  That has an edge now  They're just petrified  So that's why  You're getting sports talk  And a lot of  Fucking pop music  Out there  On your radio dial  If you're not on satellite  On your radio dial 
[01:22:00]  That's why  Because after the  I'ma's thing  Fucking  A lot of people  Got extremely scared  And said fire  Everyone  Everyone  And now this asshole  Is on MSNBC  I can't change the channel  Fast enough  Oh I know  I refuse to watch  I fuck  I've seen him  A couple of times  On it  But now  It's just the same thing  His face looks like  A rotting pumpkin  He's just  He's just always angry  And fucking  He starts his show  Every day  Because I do  Sometimes I'll sit 
[01:22:30]  For the monologue  Just to get angry  Yeah  And he's got the scowl  And the deep brow  And it's like  Fuck dude  Relax a little bit  You're on TV  In the end  It's entertainment  You dope  All I'ma should've done  Was played that  Dinkins clip  Over  And over  And said  This is the guy  Yeah  I'ma's was  Here's the guy  Trying to get me fired  Oh what the hell  Stupid  And there's other clips  I guarantee you  There's other stuff  Yeah  Oh I'm sure 
[01:23:00]  There's plenty  During the  Tawana Brawley  Of  Fakery  Yeah  That whole bullshit  Story that went down  That Mason  And Maddox  And fucking  Sharpton  All in cahoots  To fuck over  Steven Pagonis  With that  Phony little  Bitch  Lying sack  Of shit  Tawana Brawley  With racial epithets  Scratched in her  By herself  Smeared in her own  Shit  Ah 
[01:23:30]  Attention whore  And you gotta deal  With this  Stacy  Black guy  New Orleans  Go ahead  Stacy  Alright girl name  What's up  Uh  Good morning  Gentlemen  Hi Stacy  Hi  The only problem  I have  About some of the  Things that you've  Been saying  After that  Is that  You're kind of wrong  Alright  Please enlighten me  And no  It's not that  I don't like you  I enjoy the show  No I said  Enlighten me  Okay well  Let me enlighten you  Okay  Have you ever heard  Of a person  By the name of  Hannibal  Hannibal 
[01:24:00]  Yes  Hannibal Burris  A funny comic  Hannibal Lecter  Liked the Lecter  No I'm talking  About the  The gentleman  Hannibal  Who defeated  Rome  Yes with his  Elephants  Yes  Or his  Erocs  Sorry  The only man  We ever crossed  The Pyrenees  To defeat  The Romans  Yeah  Have you ever  Heard of  The city of  Mali  Have you ever  Heard of Timbuktu  Have you ever  Heard of  Timbuktu  They were a  Horrid band 
[01:24:30]  What'd they do  That  Future's so bright  I gotta wear shades  Was that them  I believe so  Timbuk three  What  No these were  These were cities  That proceeded  And came before  I think Hannibal  Was a little  Arab guy  No he was not  He was born  In the plains  Of North Africa  North Africa  Do you understand  Something  You black people  Gotta understand  Something  Hey hey  Hold on  North Africa  Is not black  People  North Africa  Is not black 
[01:25:00]  People  They are African  In that they are  From the continent  Of Africa  But North Africa  Is not  Black people  They are not  Like you  And other  Black people  They are more  Egyptian  And Middle Eastern  Than they are  Black African  But Stacey  Yes  Isn't he wrong  Stacey  Jesus  Let me  You can't claim  The whole continent  Just to make  Yourselves seem 
[01:25:30]  Like you got  This history  Of innovation  Stop it  I'm not  Sub-Saharan Africa  Is your legacy  Sorry  The Congo  Dart fur  All that shit  Somalia  This is your legacy  Because you're lying  Why are you yelling at Stacey  Because he's being dishonest  It's almost Thanksgiving  He's being dishonest  We're all thankful  He's lying  And being dishonest  To everybody  Revisionist history  North Africa 
[01:26:00]  North Africa  Is not  Black  Have a carrot cake  Have a carrot cake  What  That's true  Why is it called Africa  It is called Africa  Yeah  It's called Africa  But it's not the same  As sub-Saharan Africa  Where you have  Black  Where black people  Come from  Right  Where the slave trade  Where the slave trade  Was  Black people  In sub-Saharan Africa  In Saharan Africa  You have Middle Eastern people  In Africa 
[01:26:30]  Libya  Egypt  You're going to call Libyans  Black people  You're going to call Egyptians  Black people  Technically  They are African  They're African  But they are not  Black people  They are  They did not build the pyramids  In sub-Saharan Africa  Okay  Let me ask you a question  I guess it is like saying  You can't claim this  Is it like  Kind of like saying  Because you have Canada  You have America  Right  You have South America  We are the Americas  It is 
[01:27:00]  But it is kind of like saying  If we in America here  Do something  Brazil can't claim it  And if somebody in Brazil does it  In Canada they can't claim it  Right  Just because you're in the Americas  You know what  Africa is a big fucking continent  I'll give you that one  And you can't claim  Everything that happens  In every country  On that continent  Okay  So first of all  The slave trade was not  Sub-Saharan Africa  It was Western Africa  Sub-Saharan Western Africa 
[01:27:30]  Don't you understand  What sub-Saharan is?  It's south of the Sahara Desert  Which is  Which is the  Which is the shitty part of Africa  Where they made travoys  If they were lucky  Because no one could figure out a wheel  Why am I all of a sudden  For Lewis Black?  You want to keep the black man down  No I don't  And he wants to keep the black man down  No I don't  I'm talking  I'm talking  Anything south of Egypt  Libya  Algeria  That's what I'm talking  Meaning the best parts of Africa 
[01:28:00]  I'm talking the Sudan  Okay  You know we need  Nigeria  We need  I'm sorry to interrupt you  Stay  Nigeria  We  I'm not talking about  That area  I'm talking about  Egypt  I'm talking about  Ethiopia  And I'm talking about  The African  Ethiopia  Yes  Ethiopia is  South enough to be part of  It's right next to Somalia  My friend  Ethiopia  Is  Sub-Saharan Africa  That's  Sub-Saharan  Anything south of 
[01:28:30]  Algeria  Libya  And Egypt  Part of the  African  Sub-Continent  Which is you  To which  The world now  Calls the Middle East  Which was part of  Mesopotamia  And other parts  Mesopotamia  That was a while ago  Stacey what was it called  Back then  Like you're right  It's called the Middle East now  But what was it called  2,000 years ago  Or 3,000 years ago  It was Mesopotamia  Which is  The cradle of civilization  Anthony why do you have 
[01:29:00]  To be like that  Because I am the only one  Speaking honestly  I am the only one  Brave enough  To speak honestly  Against the black man  You are  You are spreading lies  But what about  Like let me ask you  Sub-Saharan Africa  I don't know enough  About the geography  But isn't  And these black people  No  I hate the lies  They perpetrate  He doesn't like  The revisionist history  Revisionist history  Is bullshit  But  Infecting everybody  Like a plague  But America practiced  Revisionist history  A little bit too  No  We all do 
[01:29:30]  We're proud of our  Killing of the Indians  No  Come on  We do the same thing here  We do the same thing here  You know  We act like  We came over  And it was all  Fucking apple cobbler  And love  And it was like  Alright  You can't vote  You can't vote  You can't  Come on  Sam's mom  Apple cobbler  We fix things up  We need  A guy in here  I was watching  Malcolm X clips last night  I don't know why  He's just  There's nobody  I like more than Malcolm  He's the fucking greatest  We need a nation  Of Islam guy in here  Yeah  Like a Farrakhan  I really would enjoy  You and him discussing 
[01:30:00]  But they would spout out  Revisionist lies  Like this gentleman is  And I got nothing against Stacy  He's probably been raised  To believe this horse shit  To try to make yourself feel better  How come one of the most  Could you answer me something Stacy please  How come a continent  With the most natural resources  Of probably any continent  Is full  Of poverty  And  Warlords  Infighting 
[01:30:30]  And just  Pestilence  Disease  What's going on  I can answer that  Very simple  Okay go ahead please  The countries of Belgium  Countries of Germany  Countries of Italy  Countries of France  Spain  England  The Netherlands  Yeah  And other ones  Called colonial domination  Uh huh  In the last 400 years  Alright so  Okay  Okay 
[01:31:00]  Let me finish  Alright finish  Go ahead  I'll let you say  Whatever you want  You go ahead then  I'm sorry  What's the colonial domination  When did this colonial domination  Came to an end  In the last  What 50 years  Okay  Who was the last country  That  A colonial domination  Of Africa left  That would be  Great Britain  When was that  That was less than  30 years ago  With the  With the creating  Of the apartheid  Okay  In South Africa  Now you tell me 
[01:31:30]  South Africa doing so well now  By the way  If you go in  In the last 50 years  And you've dominated  These people  You've taken  The western Africa  Which were home  To the diamond mines  Sierra Leone  The Ivory Coast  And Liberia  And what did you do  You've taken them  From their land  And you brought them  Over to where  The Caribbean  The United States  And South America  In the triangle tree  Uh huh  And you did  Wait  I know 
[01:32:00]  But I  I have a comment  To make on something  You've said already  I have a question  For Stacey though  Why  Why is it  Possible  For these  European countries  To  Uh  Uh  Colonize  Africa  When  The Africans  Uh  As you put it  Were so  Technologically advanced  Such a  Wonderful  Uh  Continent  And  And countries  Within this continent  How  How are they able  To be taken over  By these  These piddly shit 
[01:32:30]  Uh  Europeans  That had nothing  On the Africans  Well it's very simple  What  Europeans  Had something  That the Africans  Did not have  At that time  What  And they got it  Through the oriental tree  And that was called  Gunpowder  Oh well why  Why couldn't the Africans  Why couldn't the wonderful  Africans  Figure out gunpowder  They were well advanced  Of the Europeans  If you listen to  Uh  Some of the drivel  I've heard  From what I'm  What I'm saying  Is that true  Those in northern Africa 
[01:33:00]  Did have  Of course  Of the Saharan Africa  Towards  But no one was  Fucking with the northern Africans  Because they were  They were  Uh  They were still  In their stone age  They were in the  In what you would call  An ancient dark age  On the other hand  Europeans  Having to be  A step above  Coming out of  The dark ages  Into the  Age of enlightenment  They had  The tree  With the  With the orient  Through Marco Polo  In the Silk Road 
[01:33:30]  Marco  That's where they got  Spices  Really  That's where they got  Spices  And they brought in  Information  Technology  Now the rest of the  Technology that they got  They came through  In the 1100s  And the 1200s  In a little thing  Called the crusade  But why couldn't  Africa  Technologists  The size  Can I ask  Can I ask a question  Let me ask Stacy  A question too  Because Stacy's saying  That  You're saying  How come Africa  Is this mess  And Stacy's saying  Well we were colonized  Or they were colonized  Yeah  And you're saying  Well how do they get colonized 
[01:34:00]  But it taking away  The thing of how  They get colonized  Is this point valid  Like okay  This is why  Up to 50 years ago  They were  They were colonized  By you know  These other countries  Whether it was  Denmark or Great Britain  And maybe that's why  They're in a bit of  A mess now  Well how long  Did it take Americans  Once they came over  And were colonized  By the same  England  To fight  And win  Freedom  Against that  Colonization  With France's help  Well  Whatever 
[01:34:30]  Whatever  Hey  Forging alliances  Is part of war  Sure  That's very  That's very simple  No  When you're coming  From the continent  That has the gunpowder  And you're coming  Over to a continent  That one has people  That are basically  The same way  That they've been  For over a thousand years  You bring gunpowder  You bring foreign diseases  And guess what  You put a disease  In the blanket  You give it to them  And then you tell them  Hey  I got some bees  I like to buy this  I think that actually 
[01:35:00]  Happened  Or they're not used  To that disease  Now that goes  To any country  You bring  The foreign  When you bring  In a foreign  Disease  You bring a  Blown up  A pandemic  I think this is  Important talk  By the way  This week too  Because it is  Thanksgiving  Which is  Yes  This all ties in  With what this  Holiday week is  Can I get in on this  For a second there  Stacey  Can you say 
[01:35:30]  Can you say  Pudding pops  What  Pudding pops  Sounds like  Bill Cosby  You do have a bit  Of a Bill Cosby  Sorry  That's all I hear  That's all I've been hearing  The nation  Of Ethiopia  And Somalia  Now when Rudy  Went to the Sudan  Look my friend  Sorry  Sorry  You see  The thing is  From the first  When you first called  Till now  You're doing  Two different things  You were talking  About the amazing 
[01:36:00]  Continent of Africa  And the innovations  That took place there  And now you're  Making excuses  As to why  Other Europeans  Were so easily  So easily  Conquered the continent  I never made excuses  I'm just telling you  The story  From another point of view  Have you ever  Considered that  Maybe  Maybe  Some of the story  That you've been given  Has been a revisionist 
[01:36:30]  Oh I don't know  It's a possibility  I know  Have you  Possibility  Have you ever  Considered  Have you ever  Considered  That maybe  When the book  Is being wrote  By a European  Written  Yeah  Okay  Okay  I'm just the guy  I wouldn't let anything go  Criminal justice  And the deputy sheriff  And all these pairs  But okay  No problem  Okay  So when you have  Your degree  So when you have  A book  That's being wrote  In a European 
[01:37:00]  Idea  In a situation  And when you're  Writing it about  Africa  Of course  You're going to  Make yourself  Look great  But let a person  From Africa  Write it  The other way  I can't read mud  I can't read something  Chiseled in a rock  That's pretty smart  On Stacey's part  That's a good point  That's a good point  No matter  Whoever writes it  Writes it from their  Own point of view  So the truth is probably  Somewhere in the middle  Yeah  I'll holla on that one  That's true  But facts are facts  They're up for interpretation 
[01:37:30]  Now  Okay  What's the excuse  Right now  For the fact that  Billions  Upon billions  Of dollars  In aid  Pour into Africa  And nothing  Really gets  Accomplished  As far as  Advancing  Certain nations  And the  Infighting  That goes on  In Darfur  Now  You look at Darfur  And it's just  A fucking mess  What's  What's going on  It's very simple  Again  What  What 
[01:38:00]  It's very simple  Corruption  When you have  A government  That is corrupt  No matter where it is  Whether it be  In Great Britain  Whether it be  In South Africa  Whether it be  In Liberia  Ivory Coast  Sierra Leone  Anywhere in Africa  Most of those  Countries  When their  Colonial masters  Left  They did not  They did not  Leave  A system  Where they can  Tell them  Okay 
[01:38:30]  Well we leave  We walk out the door  We turn up  We close the door  And we leave the house  To you guys  This is how you do this  This is your  Educational system  This is your  Healthcare system  This is the way  You take care  Of senior citizens  This is the way  You take care  There was no structure  I know there's no structure  But shouldn't  Common sense dictate  That even if you  Don't have structure  You shouldn't go around  Hacking off people's arms  With machetes  Because they're from  A different tribe  Perhaps there's a better  Way to run your government 
[01:39:00]  Even if you can't figure out  An infrastructure  And things like that  You take the billions  In aid  And build a society  And take the help  That came from these countries  That were hindering  At one point  And now is injecting  Billions in aid  And instead  Of hacking each other apart  Stealing the money  For guns  So you can shoot  More people over the border  To your west  That you actually use it  To irrigate  And farm  And build schools  And an infrastructure 
[01:39:30]  Exactly  Okay  Okay  It's very simple  Alright  It's very simple again  It's so easy  Where did Bill Cosby  When you have  When you have  A colonial master  And they leave  One  They're going to leave  You in shambles  Because they have  Technically  They have rape  And pillage  No I understand  That  You told me that already  And now that  They have been  Asked to leave  Or they have been  Overturned  And they decide to leave 
[01:40:00]  Yeah  The people that they leave  In charge  Have looked at it  In their eyes  The same way  That they saw  The colonial masters  But there's no  Common sense there  There's no  Right and wrong  Just a common knowledge  Of what is good  And evil  And knowing  That you could  Take this money  And build a society  Or you could  Take this money  And live like a king  And hack apart  Your fucking  I have a philosophy  Okay  There's a lot of that stuff 
[01:40:30]  In a lot of these countries  Because it's hot  People get fucking cranky  It really is  Without the AC on  It never happens  In cold climates  I'll buy that  It's hot  Everybody is just  Fucking cranky  My man hot  Right  Well what it is  Is that it's  To the point  Where these people  Who are left in power  Are so corrupt  And they are so greedy  Yeah  That the ones  Who want to help  And make change  Are considered 
[01:41:00]  Agents of change  And they don't  Want to change  The system  So what do they do  They take these people  And tell them  Oh they're the enemy  They're the ones  You want to go against  We're the good guys  Well Stacy  I think we're just  Going to have to  Agree to disagree  With your point  Oh well  That's no problem  Wow  Thank you for the call  Stacy  It was a good call  Stacy thanks man  I like a nice  Heated debate  That's spoken  Honestly  Thank you sir  By the way  Anthony I want 
[01:41:30]  One thing to tell you  What up  Not everybody  Who's black  Follows the  Prescription  Of Mr. Jesse Jackson  And Mr. Al Shulton  I know that  I'm not as  I'm not as bad  As I come across  On the air  You couldn't be  I'm really not  And I have  Something else for you  I'm a gun  Toting Republican  Nice  That's fucked up  Good  I like that  Wow alright  Alright my gun  Toting friend  NRA  That was his  Dramatic out  Yeah  Dramatic out on that 
[01:42:00]  He's a good guy  I don't mind him  I like  I like  I like  Those conversations  At least they're  Open and honest  You know  Not hidden behind  Bullshit  By the way  I stand corrected  Good call on Twitter  The Russians are  Animals when it  Comes to the art  Of killing  And it's cold  There  And I will say  This  You want to talk  About people  Hacking off arms  The greatest acts  Of barbarism  On a mass scale  Stalin  Stalin and Hitler  And they're not  African  Lenin  Stalin  Just fucking  Disastrous  But I'm saying  That mentality  That can hack 
[01:42:30]  Arms off  Can you imagine  The mentality  Of an entire nation  That can exterminate  People  See here's something  It wasn't just  All about the killing  I was talking about  When you look  At the Russians  And the savagery  Of the killing  Again  The technology  That advanced  Through warfare  Over the years  With Europeans  Russians  Asians  The technology  That advances  During warfare  Is astounding  We get more technology  Out of war  Than we do  Out of anything else 
[01:43:00]  Necessity  Anything  War makes us  Unbelievable  As far as building shit  Yet  When you look  At a continent  That's been at war  With each other  For  Thousands of fucking years  You don't see  That technological  Fucking step  Up  Ever  It's still just  You know  Hey let's  Let's fucking  Get the machetes  Out and hack  People apart  Or let's take  These rifles  That were built  You know  Koleshnikovs 
[01:43:30]  And shoot people  Or  Some tanks  That were built  Somewhere else  There's no  No innovation  Going on  It's just  I find it curious  That's all  And with that  We'll play this  Oh  Iraq  Iraq wasn't paying  Attention  That's why  I did that  Was he taking  A dump  He should just  Put a toilet  In his seat  Iraq you weren't  Paying attention  Were you  No I was  Looking through  Stuff  What were you 
[01:44:00]  Looking through  The way you said it  Like I was supposed  To be playing  Some bit  I had the sweeper  Ready but  That's exactly  Why I did it  Just for some  Paying attention  Just for some  Humor  Thank you  David Tell  No he wasn't  Paying attention  David Tell's up next  Is he here  I don't know  And Jim Jeffries  Wants to call  And say hi  Because he's  Coming to New York  But we're not  Going to be on the  We're not going to be  Live for the rest of the week  So he's just going to  Call to say hi  We have Michael  Starr  Michael Starr  Yeah  He writes for the Post 
[01:44:30]  And he has a book  Called Black and Blue  It's Red Fox's book  Red Fox story  I'm like 40 pages in  It's fucking  Unbelievable  I just read the Red Fox  Malcolm X stuff  It's a great book  Yeah it's really  Interesting  What was the deal  With Red Fox  He was  Him and Malcolm X  Were criminals together  They were  I mean I knew  Malcolm X  Mentioned him in his biography  He says he was  The funniest dishwasher  Because they worked  In Harlem together  In this  This like  Jumping place  That was open all night  And they ran crimes together  They sold drugs together  Fucking  And then Malcolm X  Began pimping  And getting hardcore 
[01:45:00]  And Red Fox  Kind of backed off  But it's amazing  For a comedian  To have been tied in  Yeah right  With Malcolm X  When he was still  Malcolm Little  Red Fox was hilarious  It was great  I was watching  Red Fox clips last night  And I watched that one  Where he tells Ann Esther  To stick her face  I'll stick your face  And don't make some  Gorilla cookies  Gorilla cookies  And the laugh  There's not a good recording  Of the whole laugh  But the laugh  That explodes out of that  It's like oh  God was that fucking funny  Brilliant  Great  Now this  This is the O.P.

[01:45:30]  In September of 1620  The ship Mayflower  Left Plymouth, England  Bound for America  With 102 passengers on board  Seeking religious freedom  It was a long journey  Lasting 66 days  Yeah  Yeah  Oh we're finally  All right people  We finally made it  I told you we'd make it  Sorry about it  It's just the enthusiasm  Of the thing  Just get to read  However  Due to the incompetence  Of their retarded captain  They landed 100 miles  Off course 
[01:46:00]  From their original destination  On the Hudson River  Hey  Where the heck are we  This doesn't look like  New Jersey  Cut me some slack  Okay  You stupid asshole  You and your little dick  Dragged our asses  Across the ocean  And now you don't know  Where we are  You guys have been  Making fun of me  And my small  Forpidus the entire trip  You're god damn right  Upset  At the captain's  Irrational piloting  The crew of the Mayflower  Threw him overboard  Where he then drowned  Throw him overboard  But I can't swim 
[01:46:30]  Now I'm gonna die a virgin  The harsh New England winter  Quickly approached  And the settlers soon  Took shelter inside the vessel  Suffering from disease  And scurvy only half survived  Ugh  Scurvy is so 1590  I thought when the captain  Said we were bringing fruits  He meant some limes  Not you  Come on  Let's cuddle up  And stay warm pilgrim  Spring couldn't come fast enough  And the remaining survivors  Finally ventured  Outside their ship  How?  Yeah how?  Just like my partner 
[01:47:00]  Kinney said  To their surprise  They were greeted  By a welcome party  Of English speaking Indians  How wonderful  English speaking savages  This must be  God's will  I learned English  When some  Asshole Europeans  Came over here  And sold me  Into slavery  Slavery  And what about  The rest of your tribe  Do the other barbarians  Also speak English?  Most of them are dead  From some damn disease  The British probably  Over here with them  Oh my  That's horrible 
[01:47:30]  Yeah but that's all  Water under the bridge now  The two parties  Put their differences  Behind them  And the local Indians  Soon began teaching  The pilgrims  The skills they would need  To survive in the new world  Alright now watch closely  This is how the Indians  Taught me how to plant corn  I must admit  When you said  You were going into the fields  To bury something  I had other things  Than mine  And if you were an Indian  They'd give you the name  Speaks with genitals  And mouth  As spring turned to summer  The new settlers  Began reaping the rewards  Of their new friendship  Yay  Look at all this corn 
[01:48:00]  Wow  Whee  And soon they decided  To hold a celebration  In honor of their bounty  And new friends  You know what's a good idea  Here buddy  We should throw a party  Oh count me in  I'm on decorations  Oh what a wonderful idea  Okay if you guys say so  The feast lasted  Three whole days  And the two parties involved  Agreed to make it  An annual event  This is so much fun  We should really  Do this again  Yeah hopefully  We'll all be around for it  There are no guarantees 
[01:48:30]  You know  The two societies  Soon signed a treaty  One that lasted  Fifty years  Until more Europeans  Arrived with more diseases  And killed off  The remaining Indian tribesmen  As was now known  As Plymouth Rock  Sirius XM  Sirius XM  Yeah  This is the  O.P. and Anthony Show  David Tellen 
[01:49:00]  Studio  What's up guys  Thanks for having me  What's up Dave  Is it too early to say it  But happy Thanksgiving guys  We call it turkey day  Around here Dave  Oh now  Look at all this 
[01:49:30]  We started early  That's Sam's mom's treats  Would you like one  Have a cupcake  Have a cupcake  It's carrot cake cupcakes  Yeah  Okay now  What gave it away  The carrots  Yeah  I like how they  Idiot proof it  They tart it  So you know what it is  Right  And what's this little thing  Over there  That's a nice little  Chocolate cake  With a little white  On top of it  A little  What is it  Cream cheese icing  I believe it's the  Gumpel  On the chocolate  Yeah  No no no  That's just like a glaze 
[01:50:00]  That's not cream cheese  I heard cream cheese icing  That's on the carrot cake  Oh I got it all confused  Different icing  Yeah  David Todd did all this  Oh yes  Yeah  What a frustrated woman  Yeah  Baking usually is a sign  Of frustration  Don't you think  Yeah  It always seems that way  Sam's mom is perfect  David Todd  One of those  Stepford wives  Yeah  She's a perfect mom  And it drives us all nuts  Because we got damaged moms  Maybe not so much  Did she do like a lunch  For school when you were a boy  Oh yes  Oh god  She still does it  She still washes his clothes  She treats him like a little kid 
[01:50:30]  Still  Yeah  Yeah  It's pathetic  He's 28 I think  28  And his mom still does his laundry  Yeah well let's just hit the showers  I think too much  Too much mommy attention  And not enough mommy attention  Makes huge problems  In a kid's life  It's gotta be somewhere in the middle  Where mom you know  Pays attention to you  But also you know  Tells you to get lost  And go play on the fucking street  Like she'll ground you  But she'll also jerk you off  Right  That's a good mom  Sam's voice wasn't quite right  Yesterday David Tell 
[01:51:00]  Sam's mom called him  And said she's worried  That he might be coming  Down with a cold  And that he should  Take some medication  She says my voice sounds fat  So you live at home  No  No that's the weird part  About it  Might as well  But she heard me on the air  Oh I see  And so she thought  I was coming down  With something  So she's kind of  A meddling mom  She is  She's a little bit meddling  That's a good word  This is a sitcom  We're almost there now  We got a black friend  A meddling mom  We got a nerdy black friend  And another guy  That you can hang around  And watch the game  And eat some pizza  She keeps busting in on you guys 
[01:51:30]  She's about to bring out  The donkey porn  Who's hungry  Oh mom  You don't eat treats  David Tell  No you know  The thing is like  I was eating before the show  Because I stay up all night  Before the show usually  Because you know  I don't want to miss it  You know not like  Let's say a Voss  Right  Rich Voss  Who was supposed to be here  Calling in sick  At his age  How old is he  29  Amino feel good  I guess he could take a  He could take a break  Did Voss call in sick 
[01:52:00]  He's booked to 2012  So he can take a break  He actually called in sick  For a radio show  For a guest spot  For a guest spot  He sent an email yesterday  With all these excuses  Hey I'm not feeling too good right now  Last night didn't get a lot of sleep  My stomach's been upset  With all these symptoms  And everything  Like he was trying to eat  Nobody cares  Let's get him on the phone  He's panicking lately  We gotta talk to Voss  And calm him down  First of all  There's no second of all  Yeah 
[01:52:30]  But no  I'm excited for the holidays  And you know  I'm a whore  So guys  I'm really in here  Like for a lot of reasons  First of all  Happy Thanksgiving  And I wanted to say  Shout out to my friend  Just got married  True didn't  Oh shit  Oh I just saw this  Oh my  What a sick story  Oh god  I gotta return that gift  It's more of a  Me me me  Thing that we like to talk about  On the show  If you don't know yet  A guy got married 
[01:53:00]  And then decided to kill himself  Right after getting married  Hours  Hours after he said  I do  Put himself in the river  Hours later  I felt the same way  Back in 1991  Yeah  What a  At least you waited it out  This guy  What a selfish dick  Shout out to my friend  Who just got married  Wow that's just terrific  He left the ring behind  And jumped into the Harlem River  And a note  At the hotel  The Radisson  Says I can't live this way anymore  He just got married  Wow  Give it a few years  What a cunt  Twelve hours  As you sent him over 
[01:53:30]  To the bridge  Something happened  At the reception  I guess  Oh yeah  Wow  You know  True dating  Yeah of course  That is sad  Alright  But still  Thanksgiving has to move forward  That's the definition  Of an asshole  Right there man  Yeah you know  I'm going to Long Island  For Thanksgiving  That's where I'm from  I'm going to play the club  That I first started at  Governors on Wednesday  Nice  I don't know where you  First started Jim  Central Jersey  A little place called  The Varsity Pub Dave 
[01:54:00]  The Varsity Pub  Is it still there?  No  Yeah definitely  That's a Staples  Or something  Sponsored in New Jersey  Governors in Levittown  Yeah Levittown  Yes  Good joint  All hands on deck  All Long Island celebs  Are invited  Billy Joel  When are you  Going to be there?  Wednesday  Wednesday  You should go  It's five minutes  From me  If you drop by  I think I'm going to go  Definitely  Yeah I'm definitely  Going to go  I don't have to work  You get a chance  To see David  Tell him he's five minutes  From your house  You got to do it 
[01:54:30]  I know  Two shows  One good  One bad  I'll check out  The bad one  But he doesn't tell you  Which one's bad  You never know  That's the trick  I've been tanking it  So hard lately  I don't know what it is  What?  No I started doing  The Penn State stuff  It kind of reinvigorated me  You know you get  Like a new honk  And you're like  Yeah I kind of enjoy  Performing  Well what's your take on it?  Were you fucking  A ten year old on stage?  Yeah no I just  Been going up there going  What's with this  Penn State right?  That's a good one  The crowd goes nuts  Right?  That's all you have to say  Yeah I'm like  I'm like what is this  Penn State up the ass 
[01:55:00]  Or something  Crazy stuff  Every time right?  Yeah  Well I don't know  It's a great day for soccer  Right?  Am I right?  You always thought  Your kid was a little fruity  If he went to soccer  Now you  Safe  Safe haven  No I  I don't know  I've just been bombing  Left and right  But I think this is going to be it  I'll come back hard on this  And then you know  We got our tour coming up  So it's going to be exciting  God I can't wait to see you guys  Him and I have already  Stressed out about it  Why?  We just do it on the phone  All the time  We're the two fucking 
[01:55:30]  Yentas just panicking  Tickets and fucking  Should we do this and that  We do  Well you know  I think the point is  Like Bregada  Right?  And like we're  Sold out one show  Yes totally sold out  And then next show  We're trying to do it  Yeah the reason the second show  Is sold out  Is because last year  We went on sale on a Sunday  And that's the  That's the harder night to sell  So when we went  We didn't have a Saturday room then  We only had Sunday  So we sold out the first one  At basically the same pace  This one did  And then we backtracked  To the Saturday  And the second one sold out  But this one we started  On the Saturday  Sold out the same  But now we have to sell 
[01:56:00]  The Sunday which is harder  So it's like  We've got to sell  The Sunday out  Well as the only Jew  On the tour  I'm telling him  That he's doing everything  Oh excuse me  Oh well  Oh the carrot cake cupcakes  Even flinched a little bit here  Wait a minute  We didn't know that  Now we got a holiday  Because you're  Jotting stuff down  I think that you're  Marketing it wrong  And that this  This is a different tour  Than the last one  With Billy and Jim  So this is a more evil tour  I'm not saying it's a funnier tour  It's just more evil 
[01:56:30]  It's like Stan Hope  And Artie Lang  So you know  We should be hitting  We should be hitting  Like a gun shows  You should get a part  On Boardwalk Empire  I mean  Truck stop  Peanuts  Peanuts  I'm not marketing it  In any way though  We're getting a billboard  But the Borgata  The way it works is  Because they kind of  Put the line up together  Fast and went on sale  We have a billboard  Going up outside  The Lincoln Tunnel  But they had already  Fucking promised it  To somebody  So we don't get  The billboard  Until December  Oh just another singer  But I mean  It's not Astro Boy  Is it?  One of the problems 
[01:57:00]  We actually sold  A lot of tickets  And then the billboard  Becomes less important to them  Because they want to sell  Shows that aren't sold out  Referenced Astro Boy  Yeah  That's classic  I can't believe it  I thought it was knocked out  In the end  There's no worries here  No not at all  It's going to be a great show  It'll sell out  I think it's going to be  The last truly filthy show ever  Because it's so politically correct  This could be it  It is going to be  A very very dirty show  Obviously  I mean  Oh yeah  Myself you  Stan helps a piece of garbage  Special guest  Artiest shit 
[01:57:30]  Yeah I'd like to bring  A special guest  We're going to beat  A baby seal to death  At the end of it  And then I'll come on it  And laugh  Hit the showers  Imagine the look of horror  On the crowd's face  If you literally bash  The baby seal's head in  On stage  But I'm going to do  It's a big dirty joke thing  So what I'm going to do  Is I'm going to give  Like a little joke  Like you know  Some real fun party jokes  That you can take home with you  Oh those are cool  I like to do that at the end  People like that  When they can tell the joke  On the way home  A priest and a Jew  Get into a boat  And you know  The crowd are going nuts  What happens Jim? 
[01:58:00]  What happens Jim?  Especially that fun ride  Out of AC  That's a great one  Oh yeah  You miss that off ramp  You're in Camden  Then it gets really scary  There's nothing worse  Than that drive back  That's the only time  When you're allowed  To say to a girl  Shut up  Shut up  I'm thinking  I'm thinking  I'm trying to save  Our lives here  It's a horrible ride  It's terrible right?  Oh it's so depressing  Always  Freeway  Even if you had  The best time ever  It just sucks  Oh god  One wrong turn  And you are shot  In your fucking driver's seat  Yeah  You're either in downtown AC 
[01:58:30]  Or you are in Camden  It's fucking horrifying  That is nasty  You really gotta focus  Hey Jim Jeffries  Wants to say hi  Oh that's great  Here's the deal  With Jim Jeffries  He's coming to New York  But we're not doing  Any more live shows  This week  And he's kind of  Bummed about that  I saw you  I saw you tweeting that  Jim Jeffries  Sorry  How are you doing guys?

[01:59:30]  I heard they're gonna bring back  Some like classic  Yeah  Floats from yesterday  I'd love to see some of those  Like Uncle Tom  And  Amos and Andy  Amos and Andy  Giant lawn jockey waving  Ching ching chinga chang  All the stereo  And Bullwinkle  Of course  He always  He's got the biggest whore  Of that parade  Every day  Every time  How funny  They make it  To a racist  Fucking parade  Out of nowhere  Betty White

The Penn State  Well you know  He also had the charity 
[02:00:30]  As well  So he wasn't all bad  Was he?  Exactly  You're right  See  Sometimes it takes  A foreigner  To get a different  Take on the  I mean don't they  It's something different  Over where you live  I think rugby  Well rugby  They had their scandal  Where the  The big famous  Was it a rugby guy  That was blowing the dog  Getting blown by a dog  Oh yeah  Oh yeah  That was a rugby league player  Was being sucked off  By a dog  But he did it as a joke  Yeah  Right  Just a joke  That's the difference  It wasn't like  The guy was doing it 
[02:01:00]  To upset the dog  Or anything  No  I feel this thing  At Penn State  Had a sinister undertone  I think you're right  Just a tad  A little bit  A sinister undertone  Yeah and the dog  Doesn't know it's licking dick  No  Yeah  It's not like he  Feels all bad about it  No I should  It's not a shame  At the end of it  The dog has  The dog has the ability  To bite back  You know  If the dog's not  Biting back  Who's hurting it  What are you saying  Kids don't have teeth  Please 
[02:01:30]  He could have ran out  Of that shower  He'd have to stand there  And take that  Slap slap slapping  He took all the  Free fucking football  It's called horse play  Horse play  You gotta scream that  Next time  Horse play  That's the thing  With a guy  You think like  Because being a  Pedophile is like  An illness right  Like I'm sure  No one enjoys  Like I enjoy  But I'm sure  No one's really  Comfortable with it  No one's like  I'm really happy  With this decision  I've made  After he gets caught  And everything  And it's all over  You think there'd be 
[02:02:00]  A moment with a guy  Where he'd go  Yeah I'm a dick  Please forgive me  But he's just  Left one of the  Slap horse play  Sure I showered  With him  Who wouldn't  Sure I  Sure I flicked  One of them  With a towel  You have to  You have to  Shower with him  How else are they  Going to get  The cum off them  That's funny  Yeah  Jim  See this guy  We gotta get him  On the tour too  At some point  It's just the language  Is a little salty  Yeah he is  Yeah he takes it  To a different level  Yeah we'll be great

[02:28:00]  Opie  Anthony  Hi  Black and Blue  The Red Fox Story  Are you Michael  I know you're Michael  Seth Starr  Is it because Michael Starr is the actor  Mike Starr or have you always been Michael Seth Starr  No you don't have to use a Seth by the way  That's just the author  Oh the author okay  No  Microphone  Yeah I actually  I actually know  We aren't  Yeah yeah  Everybody says that  We have to get a montage  Yeah I know  Sorry about that  No but I know  I know Mike Starr  But no I'm not  That's not me  The book is really good  I haven't finished it because I was on the road  But what made you want to write about Fox 
[02:28:30]  You know I was actually shocked that nobody had ever written about him before  I mean you know he was a huge sitcom star in his time  You know in the early to mid 70s  And you know if you've read the book  I mean he has a very  He led a very interesting life  And was a trailblazer in many respects  Can we ask him if the Otto story is true  About the fur on the outside of the Cadillacs  Is that in the book  Yeah yeah  They called it car flocking  But that was a goof right  No I mean he was you know  One thing Red wasn't  Was a good  He was not a good businessman  But that was a real  That was a real  That was a real idea  Yeah  I haven't read that yet 
[02:29:00]  And somebody said  You know what happens when it rains  Yeah  And he went off  Wasn't he the original like dirty party tape  Like when people  Like his LP  Yeah  People would gather around  Like people always say Richard Prye  But it really was Red Fox  Was like the people would get together  And like listen to his tapes  Yeah right  They called them party records  Party records  Right  In 1956 he put out something called  Laugh of the party  And he was just talking about stuff  That nobody at that time was talking about  You know  Sex and bodily hygiene  And all that kind of stuff 
[02:29:30]  And you know  Wash your ass  Yeah  You gotta wash your ass  You gotta wash your ass  Ladies  I just saw a clip of him  I've been watching  I've been watching Fox clips all week  And he was just talking  It was a recent stand up one  From later in his life  He was just talking about midgets  And how he just hated them  And he just said  The midget said something  He's like  Get away from you  You little short motherfucker  And I'm like  What a funny guy  Just to say  Get away from me  You little short motherfucker  What a funny basic thing to say  About a midget  Oh he was great 
[02:30:00]  Probably wouldn't go over well  In today's climate  But yeah  That's true  I'd give it a whirl  But I think he would do it anyway  That might have been the other word  From earlier by the way  Midget you know what  We were trying to find PC words  That were banning in the country  And right  We had three  Little person  It's little person  That's right  I've got a whole thing  We say kickable  Kickable yeah  So what made you  No one had written about Red  I call him Bunt  There you go  Yeah nobody had written about him  And you know  I mean I'm 50  So I remember when  Sanford and Son was on 
[02:30:30]  The first time  It was a huge show  And he was a huge star  Kind of you know  Once he left  He went to ABC  He signed this mega deal  To host a variety show  You know for over  A million bucks a year  And was never quite able  To recapture the TV success  So he tried  They brought Sanford back  Actually in like  I think it was 1980  In a show called  Sanford without the sun  It was him  And like a white  You remember that one  Yeah  Big white redneck guy  Oh right  Cow  Cow  That didn't work  Yeah it didn't work  And then they brought him back 
[02:31:00]  As like a newspaper  He owned a newsstand  In New York  That didn't work  And then they brought him back  For another sitcom  That didn't work  And then the last one  The royal family  He died on the set  What was the story  Oh really  I didn't know  It's an interesting story too  About how he's  It's in the beginning of the book  Where he's being interviewed  By lifestyles  Rich and famous  And he had kind of fallen  So far by that point  Where there was  Some guy just came up  And interrupted his interview  I mean he's on set Rad  Yeah exactly  He was  You know  He had had a reputation  For acting up on that 
[02:31:30]  He was a pain in the ass  Basically  He was a party guy man  Like he would  Mountains of coke  And just  Like on set  And that was his thing  Which I always thought  Was like so cool  That like he would do bumps  And then go out  And then like  Le Mans  You know  Esther  He wore a little spoon  Around his neck  He was snorting coke  At the table readings  Was he really  Yeah yeah  There's quotes  Of people telling me that  You know  His co-stars  Wow  Damn  That's hardcore  Here's something  That I always like  Because I used to love 
[02:32:00]  Like just like  Everything about him  Because I always thought  He was like  The most dangerous comic  Like you know  Of his era  He's really unknown  As a comic  Just as like  That character  But during the 40s  To get out of  World War II  He ate soap  Right  To be crazy  Whatever  To get out of  Heart palpitations  Yeah  Heart palpitations  Right  And that became  Like a recurring theme  Yeah  The heart  That's right  You know  And when he had  The fatal heart attack  On the set  They thought he was  Joking around  You know  He clutched his chest  It's like  Come on Red  Get up 
[02:32:30]  Quit fooling around  How old was he  68  That was it  Wow  Yeah  I mean he wasn't  Even 50  When they started  Sanford  People always think  Of him as  This old guy  Yeah  Old guy  But you know  They grade up his hair  And he had  The bow legged shuffle  Which he used  And that kind of thing  He was only 68  And he was so instrumental  In like getting  Pryor started  Like when Richard  Left the clean circuit  And walked off stage  At the Aladdin  He would do all the  Black clubs  And Red Fox's club  And he did  Pryor to his  Fox hunting  Was an old Richard album 
[02:33:00]  And I think he gave  Red Fox a lot of credit  For helping him  Really like  Go through that  Metamorphosis  He did  He hung out a lot  At Red's comedy club  Which was called  Red's place  On La Cienega  In LA  And he cut some albums  There I think  Two or three albums  Richard Pryor did  Probably with the old  Laugh Records  When he was on Laugh Records  Yeah yeah yeah  And they hung out a lot  And I think he looked  Did Red as a mentor  I love reading about these guys  Like I've known about him  And the Malcolm X  Connection  Which is my favorite part  Of it  Because it's just  Such an unlikely  Pairing of people  You wouldn't think  But I love reading  About what  The criminal shit 
[02:33:30]  They did in New York  In the 40s  It was real gangster  Yeah man  It's great to read  About these guys  That became  These amazing comedians  And you were saying  Earlier that Malcolm X  Went really bad  And I want to know  A little more about that  It was the crossroads  For Red Fox  He decided to  Bail on Malcolm X  At that point  Yeah I think  I think it wrecked  Their friendship  Where they were just  Selling pot together  Yeah they were selling  Selling suits off of rooftops  And that sort of  You know anything  To make a buck  But then Malcolm X  Said fuck this  I'm going even harder  Yeah yeah pretty much  And you know  Red was never 
[02:34:00]  A political guy  You know he was  He wasn't into politics  And Malcolm X  Was sort of heading  In that direction  He was still known  As Malcolm Little  Back then  And then he eventually  Went to jail  I don't know  For eight or nine years  I think  Yeah  I thought he did six  I could be wrong  He did it for  I don't know  For Malcolm  Yeah I don't remember  But you know  But they sort of  They sort of broke off  After two or three years  Of pretty close friendship  They worked together  At a place called  Jimmy's Chicken Shack  In Harlem  And I know  X mentioned him  In the biography  His biography  But I didn't know 
[02:34:30]  That they were that close  I thought it was literally  They had done a quick gig together  I didn't realize  They actually ran together  In the streets  Yeah no they were  Very close friends  And Captain Touch  Sort of afterwards  I mean there's a picture  In the book  Of Red going to meet  Then he was known  As Malcolm X  Then you know  Sort of reuniting  In the early 60s  In Harlem  At a restaurant  But they didn't really  Keep in touch  Actually when Malcolm X  Was assassinated  Some people went to Red  And said you know  What do you think  You know that kind of thing  But once their friendship  Broke up from the Harlem days  It was never really  Never really that close 
[02:35:00]  Yeah I guess it's kind of hard  When you're doing  You're doing you know  Gigs and being a dirty comic  And a guy is  Preaching the word  Of the Honorable  Elijah Muhammad  Right  It's difficult to find  A fucking middle ground  There  That you can agree on  What an odd couple  That would have been  That would have been  A great play  How when did Red  Get into the drugs  Because I haven't  Again I was  I haven't gotten  Into that part  Of the book yet  When did he start  Getting  Was it  It was just  Pot of those days  It was pot  It was mostly pot  In the 40s  I mean he  Walked in on some people  Who were doing  The harder stuff 
[02:35:30]  And he saw a couple  Of his friends  Had died from  From Odin  And he said  That's not for me  He tried  He tried heroin  Once when he  Went back to St. Louis  Which is where he was from  And he didn't care for it  It was mostly pot  And I think  In the 50s  And especially  In the early  To mid 60s  The cocaine  Habit really kicked in  And then  You know it was just  As somebody in the book says  It was just sort of  Part of his daily routine  Like you know  We have a cup of coffee  He has  They used to cut his cocaine  To make it less  Less strong  Without him knowing it  Without him knowing it  So you know  But he would just 
[02:36:00]  He would just do it  And as you said before  Jim I mean he was  Very open about it  On the set  And was just part  Of the routine  Now he owed the IRS  A lot of money  When he died  Was it because of the drugs  Or well bad business deals  Obviously  Yeah combination  Bad business deals  Didn't well  Didn't pay his taxes  Because he just said  Fuck it I'm not paying my taxes  Actually there's a line  One of his favorite lines  He said you know  I'll pay my taxes  When there's a black president  And you know  Well I guess  You'd be paying his taxes  Oh boy  But he owed  About  He owed over  Three million dollars 
[02:36:30]  When he passed away  And had just made a deal  To start paying it back  When he had the big one  And somebody said  You know  Listen  He got away with it  He checked out  Didn't have to pay his taxes  Did he ever have any kids  Yeah  No he had no kids  He had  His second wife  Her name was Jean  He adopted her daughter  Her name is Deborah  Because they're both still alive  And they're still around  But no biological kids  That we know of  Right  And it's fun  The part you talked about too  With the hair  When he found his friends dead  He was doing  I think nightclub gigs  And doing a little MC work 
[02:37:00]  And he was kind of singing  And he was working a gig  And they said  They asked him to come back  And get high  And he goes  After my set  So literally  If he had just gone back with them  He would have been dead  He was supposed to get high  With those guys  Yeah  And he didn't  He never forgot the way  They were laying on the bed  With their legs up in the air  And stiff and rigor mortis  And all that  But yeah  So he stayed away from that  From the harder stuff  But it was a  Very heavy  Regular pot user  And cocaine user  Didn't Murphy try to help him  Because I know they did  Harlem Nights  Prior Murphy  And Red Fox 
[02:37:30]  And oh god  Who is the woman  Della Reese  Della Reese  And didn't Eddie try to help him  With his taxes or something  You know  I think it's  A little more of a myth  That he did  I mean  He did pay for Red's funeral  But when Red first got  When the IRS came  And took all his money away  I mean  He actually went on TV  And he said  You know  I wish  All it takes is somebody  Like Eddie Murphy  To come forward to help me  And he never did  But he did pay for his funeral  And he did create the sitcom  The Royal Family 
[02:38:00]  Because he saw that  Red and Della Reese  On the set of  Harlem Nights  Sort of you know  Bickering with each other  Good naturedly  And he said  You know  There's a sitcom there  And according to the story  I don't know how true it is  He went into his trailer  And a half hour later  Came out with a treatment  For a sitcom  And sold it  Oh I didn't know that  For Red  Yeah for Red  Oh okay  For Red and Della Reese  What was the Mike Douglas story too  Because he was unhappy with  His contract at one point  I guess with Sanford and Son  Or something  What was he unhappy with  Well  The story that was in the press  Was he wanted a window  In his dressing room  That was the thing 
[02:38:30]  That everybody played up  And you know  I mean listen  I work for the Post  I know these things  You know  These are the things  You sort of focus on  And you play up  As the big thing  But I mean it was money  He wanted more money  He had done two seasons  Of Sanford and Son  It was you know  The top rated  One of the top rated sitcoms  Yeah  Right behind  All in the  Sanford and Son  And All in the Family  Kind of went back and forth  God  I didn't know it was that big  Oh yeah it was big  It was big  And he wanted as much money  As Carol O'Connor was making  On All in the Family  He wasn't getting it  What was  What were they getting 
[02:39:00]  Respectively  You know  O'Connor  O'Connor also bickered  With you know  The network  Which was CBS  And Norman Lear  And he was getting  I think at that time  About $25,000 to $30,000  An episode  Which was for that time  Very good money  It was like $75,000  Right  And Red was getting  I don't know  $10,000  So he walked out  Famously  He walked out  He missed about  Eight episodes  They moved  Whitman Mayo  Who was playing Grady  You know  Moved into the starring role  And you know  And Fred was away  Visiting relatives  In St. Louis  At a funeral 
[02:39:30]  They always do that  Right right  So funny how they do that  And it was a big deal  At the time  And NBC  Once Whitman Mayo  Moved in  NBC made a point  To say hey  You know  The ratings are just as good  Red  You know  If you don't come back  We'll go on without you  And I think he sort of  Got the message  Wow  Were they just as good  They were  I don't know if they were  Exactly as good  But they were pretty good  And he did come back  And he did get a nice raise  And he got the window  In the dressing room  He got a golf cart  So he could tool around  Oh he got the raise though  He got the raise  Little Charles Sheen  Because I'm wondering  If they only watched 
[02:40:00]  Because they knew  He'd be back  If he was off the show  No he was off the show  For a while  And they actually  Started taping  The next season  Without him  And then  The chronology was  He came back  And they ended up  Using like the third episode  That he was in  As the first episode  One of those things  But yeah  I mean he was  He was going to walk  I mean he threatened to walk  Whether or not  He was going to give up  The gravy train  How many years did he do  Yeah how many years  Six I think  Six years  Wow that's great  I didn't know it was on that  I didn't either  Which came first  Chico and the Man  Came before that  No it was Sanford and Son 
[02:40:30]  Okay so Freddie Prince  He was  That was really only on  For two years right  Chico and the Man  Or something  With  I think it might have  Tried to go on  Without him  I know but  The whole idea was  He was the first guy  Of that generation  To like  He's 21 years old  He was doing comedy  For like two years  And he became this huge  He was the first  Real like superstar  It sort of went  Like all in the family  Sanford and Son  Chico and the Man  And then the rest of you  And then just the Man  Yeah  And then sadness  And the Man  Kind of like Sanford  Just the Man  The classic story 
[02:41:00]  And I don't know  If you know this guy  Mike Rowe  Who was  Not the guy from  Not Dirty Jobs guy  No no the other guy  He was a comic  He's a comic  And he's also a writer  He's written for Family Guy  And Futurama  Very very funny guy  He does all the impressions  And he knows everything  About you know  All the comics  From the 70s and 80s  And he always  Would tell us the story  You know which is  Like a legendary story  Of Red Fox  Playing Vegas  And he walks out  To the music  You know  The Sanford and Son  You know  Music  And there's 10 people 
[02:41:30]  In the audience  He's like 10 motherfucking people  Yeah I'm not playing  Yeah right  And then he walks off  And they do the music  And that's been done  And that's been done  In like  Like on The Simpsons  On every other show  Yeah true story  Yeah that is true right  True story  Okay cool  Yeah that's really cool  I mean you know  He could  Even what  I'm not doing it justice  Because Mike could do it  In like five different  Right  With the music  With the red voice  He's very good  He's really good  But I mean he was  Red was a huge draw in Vegas  Could roll out of bed  And make a million bucks  I mean 
[02:42:00]  And his act did get raunchier  In later years  I mean it was  Really?  Well in the 50s  If you listen to the records now  You're like  Eh big deal  But you know  Back then  You know Eisenhower was president  People weren't talking about  You know  Going to the bathroom  You know  Sex and all that kind of stuff  But later on  He just went  Whole hog  And he just laid it out  He actually never even used  Profanity in the early days  He would say you know  Thug and sug  Instead of you know  Right  Taking the hog round eh  I don't like that 
[02:42:30]  For a little while anyway  When Pryor talked about  And again mid 70s  He talked about  I think it was  Nixon being raped in jail  How they would have loved  To rape him  Oh wow  And they said  By now standards  But back in the mid 70s  They talked about  The president being raped  Black comedian  I mean it was a big deal  Of course  These guys were ballsy  Yeah  To go out and do what they did  And I love just hearing  Just the fucking arrogance  Of some of these guys  In those days  You know  I just  I love the fucking  Justified arrogance 
[02:43:00]  But he was never a loved  Like you know  He was never like a loved  Comic by the white  You know  Like he wasn't a crossover guy  Until he did that TV show  Right  Because he  Before that he was really  On the chitlin circuit  On like black clubs only  Right  But Richard Pryor  And those guys  Who came a little later  They were a crossover  Like coffee house  Yeah  Red Foxx never was that guy  No  Not until  Sanford and Son  He played rough dives  You know  Honky tonks  Jute joints  You know  Like the Moms Mabley type gigs 
[02:43:30]  Yeah  All those gigs  Yeah  That was like  Yeah  And LaWanda Page  You played Ann Esther  Was also touring those  She was a friend of his  From they went to  Elementary school together  So they knew each other forever  She wasn't as old  As I thought too  It's funny  I watched a brief  Stand up clip of her  Last night  Where she walks up  And she hikes her skirt up  And she actually had  Nicer legs than you'd expect  Like I might have  Actually fucked Ann Esther  And she lifts up her skirt  And she does a joke  About how she's got  Peanut butter legs  You know  Brown cream  Easy to spread  You know  Mild now  But she's talking  About getting fucked  Yeah  And it's funny 
[02:44:00]  How the biggest shows  Back in that time  With all the family  They were all ethnic  They all addressed race  And the differences  Between people  And it's just  It's such a nice era  For comedy  And now it's just  Now it's  To be avoided  At all costs  Avoid it  Only show a race  In an idealized way  Like you know  We all have friends  Of all races  And we don't notice  Each other's differences  Or if we do  But all the family  Was honest  Jefferson's  Honest  Even if it's wrong  At least it's honest  Chico and the man 
[02:44:30]  Sanford and son  Fucking Archie Bunker  Was at a party  And Jefferson was having  A fight with his mother  And then Archie  Just walks over to George  And says  Hey you shouldn't  Know how to be  Talking to your mammy  That way  And the woman  Turns around  She goes  Who you calling mammy  It's like  Fucking fantastic  You would never see  Anything like that  Nowadays  Now you see  A stupid Olive Garden  Commercial  It's like  I'm here with my friends  And it's like  There's a black guy  An Asian chick  A white girl 
[02:45:00]  The gay guy  It's like  Really  You're all hanging out  Are you  Bullshit  No  If you look at  Especially TV in the 60s  And black performers  You had Bill Cosby  On I Spy  And Julia  With Diane Carroll  That was it  And then along comes  This junk guy  With his son  In Watts  It was just  It was revolutionary  Flip Wilson  It was a great  Flip Wilson  I forgot  That's right  He's another guy  Who's like  Nobody ever talks about him  But for a while there  He ruled  He was huge  That was the first  Sketch comedy show 
[02:45:30]  Right  Yeah  I think  Yeah  That was before  The Smothers  Oh no  That was after  But that was number one too  For several years  The Flip Wilson show  Was enormous  And he was  He was also a good friend  He actually credited Red  With getting him  His start on the Tonight Show  Because Johnny Carson  The story goes  Asked Red  If he knew of anybody  Who was funny  And he said  You know  You gotta check out  Flip Wilson  And didn't he  Also  He had this like  Traumatic thing  Happened in his family  Where he had to take care  Of his own kids  He had to raise his own  Kids  Flip Wilson  See yeah  Something like that  I'm not sure about that  Because he disappeared 
[02:46:00]  And people were like  What happened to him  And then he  It was like  He was raising his kids  Or something  I don't know  Yeah I don't know  But yeah  He's another sad guy  There's a lot of sad stories  Man with these guys  You know  Bad endings  Yeah because they get  They don't  They're not looked out for  By people around them  Making  They have bad business deals  They didn't know  But you know  Especially the Black Axe  Came up in the fucking  Forties and the fifties  Man  It's not like it is today  I mean  They came through really bad  It's a tough circuit to work  And then you got like Red  It was all of a sudden  He's making a million dollars a year  And it's like whoa  You know  It's just like spending it  And not you know  Buying a building 
[02:46:30]  Never paying the rent  All that kind of stuff  He also got famous late  And that was the same thing  With Rodney  Where they became  They hit like in their  Fifties whatever  Right  So there was a lot of like  You know  Making up for lost time  With those guys  Yeah  Because they partied  Like they were in their twenties  I know that  You know  Norman Lear too  You talked about  And we had John Amos in  And he had problems  With Norman Lear  And the writing  And was  James  He didn't like the way  What did he say  Put a  Yeah  He goes  Whenever there was a problem  Just put a chicken hat on JJ 
[02:47:00]  And he told us that he was fired  I didn't know he was fired  I had always thought he'd quit  But he said he was fired  Was Norman Lear  A prick to his talent  I mean  If Carol O'Connor had problems  And Red Fox  And John Amos  I mean  Those were some of the biggest guys he had  Well I think he was  Tight-fisted  I mean  You know  Carol O'Connor had contract dispute with him  As did Rob Reiner  On All in the Family  Then you had Red  On Sanford  But when Red was doing Sanford  He was dealing more with  Bud Yorkin  Who was Lear's partner  And there's a story in the book  That you know 
[02:47:30]  That Red hated Bud Yorkin  And he wouldn't even  He barred him from the set  Actually at one time  I love when they  They said he'd break out in a rash  Every time he heard his voice  I love when they barred the guy  From the set  That's the greatest  Yeah he said he drove up  And the guard said sorry  You know  Can't get in  Even though he was the producer  Of the show  Wow  So yeah  I think  Why did Red hate him?  Did he say?  I think  I think a lot of it was money  And I think he just  You know some people you meet  And you just don't like them  Yeah  The sound of their voice  The way they look  And I think that was  That was how he was  With Yorkin  I think before those  Norman Lear shows  Of the early 70s 
[02:48:00]  The talent on those shows  Really just  Kind of were happy  To be there  You know  And the studios  And producers  Really had the say  And then I think  When they started  Realizing  Hey we're popular  Because you know  We're making you a lot of money  We're making you money  Then they stepped up  And wanted more money  And I don't think  The producers  And whatnot  Knew how to deal with that  I think you're right  At first  Because that was really  The first time that happened  I mean really  Look at Bewitched  Fucking Darren Stevens  Said fuck you  And they said  No fuck you 
[02:48:30]  Right  Hey here's a new Darren  Bring in a new Darren  Fuck you  People will get used to it  Right  We don't care  What do you think  My mother the car is about you  It's about the car asshole  The money though  Back then was such  Nothing compared to  Today's money  You know  When you think about like  The two and a half men money  Yeah  That's crazy  Million six  Or whatever it was  Five million an episode  Yeah when people  First started arguing  About a million dollars 
[02:49:00]  An episode  It really got crazy  Who was the first one  To make a million  An episode  I know  Was it Seinfeld  Or was it before that  I know friends  Were talking about that  But it was before that  Has it been Tim Allen  Or Kelsey Grammer  Who's after older  Than those guys  Yeah  They weren't making  Tim Allen was making  A million when he left  The first time  And then Ray  And then  I don't know if they  Were making it  Per episode  But then  There was no really  Such thing as like  A back end back then  I mean like  They get residuals  Just because of the  Well one of the things 
[02:49:30]  That Red fought for  In this  When he walked out  Was ownership of the show  Which he got  And then he lost  When he divorced his wife  And she took a lot  Oh shit  She took a lot of that money  Ownership of the show  So she took a lot  Of the money  That he got  Of the money  Right  Right  Is she still  Yes  Actually he was married  Four times  And I know  His second wife  Is definitely alive  And he married  Two other women  Towards the end of his life  And I believe  They're still alive  I couldn't find them  So I didn't interview him  What was the youth movement too  Because Pam Adlon  Is a friend of mine  And she was in one of his sitcoms 
[02:50:00]  Yeah she's in the book  Oh shit it's good  Yeah I interviewed her  When you look at  All in the family  San Francisco  All the shows  We just spoke about  They weren't good looking people  They were very average  To below average  Regular relatable  Fucking older people  And then she said  There was some youth movement  That happened  Where a lot of the older people  Were pushed out of Hollywood  Like the Norman Lears  And all these people  Who had life experience  And then this youth movement  Came in  And they just wrote about things  They had watched on TV  And it's like  Now it's all good looking people  And attracted people  I want to know  What happened with that 
[02:50:30]  What is it?  I think some of it  Has to do with the executives  Who came to power  I mean they were  They were younger  And as you said  They pushed a lot of  The older guys out  I mean like  CBS  Towards the end of the 60s  They got rid of all  Great Green Acres  And the Beverly Hillbillies  And all that kind of stuff  And they did have  All in the family  But you're right  I mean there were shows  That had people  Who you wouldn't  Today you'd say  What is this guy doing  Headlining a sitcom  But I think a lot of it  Has to do with the executives  And this  I don't know if it's a myth  That the younger people  Spend more money  I don't know 
[02:51:00]  I mean younger people  Usually don't have  As much money  As older people  So they kind of  Started to shift the shows  And create shows  That they remembered  From their youth  Which was different  Than you know  We were used to  Like MASH  I mean look at MASH  I mean Alan Wall  Is a handsome guy  But none of them  Are beautiful  I mean you know  Margaret Houlihan  We all would have fucked  But  Yeah  Yeah come on  What about Harry Tyler Moore  Back in the day  She was too good though  She was too goody two shoes  I kind of liked her  More in Ordinary People  And she was just  This icy bitch  Fucking emasculating 
[02:51:30]  Donald Sutherland  Over her stupid brown socks  Fucking Buck's funeral  She really was a bitch  In that one  Oh she's the greatest  Just hated her son  That lived  Mary Richards  Wasn't Green Acres  Was that like a movie  For us with  What Carrie Fisher's mother  Like the farmer's daughter  Kind of thing  How did that come about  Because that's like  When you think  When you look back on it  It's like  Some dude  Like had a nervous breakdown  Or something  And he's running a farm  With a pig  A talking pig  And it's like  Mail order  Nazi bride 
[02:52:00]  It's like a weird  Weird deal  It was a weird deal  Mail order  Nazi bride  I mean like  How did they meet again  What was that about  Oh they like  Went bankrupt or something  Right  Something happened  Yeah and  Right she wanted to  Live in the country  Oh okay  You know  She wanted to live in the city  He wanted to live in the country  Yeah yeah  Said it all in the song  I forgot  Goodbye city life  Yes  Yeah  But there were  There were a bunch of those shows  Green Acres  And  Petticoat Junction  Petticoat Junction  Right  So they were big  In the mid 60s  And CBS  I think at the end  Decided that  The audience wasn't buying into that 
[02:52:30]  Although I think  They still were pretty popular shows  Did Red feel like  I know a lot of performers  Like John Amos  Hated the way  Again  He said  Put that hat on JJ  Right  Did he  Did it bother Red at all  Some of the stereotyping  Actually yes  And he was instrumental  Actually in bringing in  A couple of the black writers  In the show  He demanded that they hire  A black writer  Oh they didn't have any  They didn't have any  The first  I'm going to guess  The first season  And they brought in  A guy named  Ilunga Adel  Yeah  His real name was  Adele Stevenson  He went to African  Changed his name 
[02:53:00]  Wow  It was hardcore  They brought him in  And then  They hired several more  African American writers  And I think that  Mollified him a little bit  For how maybe  Stereotypical he felt it was  Whenever those cops  Came to the door  Boy the white cops  When they come to the door  Hey  Well they're scratching  Their head with the pistol  What's going on here  The dumb white cops  Swanee  Swanee and Hoppy  Yeah  Yeah I mean listen  It was a show that  At its heart 
[02:53:30]  Was about a guy  Who didn't want his son  To leave home  That's what Red always said  You know  It could be any color  Happened to be  You know  Set in a predominantly  Black cast  But yeah  There were things  He was upset about  And some of the ways  Some of the women  Were portrayed  And he spoke out  In that in interviews  And some of the characters  Yeah  But um  What did he say  On Mike Douglas  Did he talk about this stuff  Or was it purely  Contract stuff  It was mostly contract stuff  You know  He had left the show  Under the guise of being  You know  Ill  He had a bad back  He had a bad knee  That was the networks  Right  That's what he said 
[02:54:00]  Oh he did  That's what he said  Yeah yeah  And then he went on  To Mike Douglas  He said well  I'm fine  I just want more money  You know  I'm paraphrasing  But he said  It's really about the money  Did it help him  He didn't come back  For another  For about another month  And a half  So I think  The network  Was pretty pissed off  When they heard that  But eventually  You know  They  They had a meeting  Of the minds  So he was gone  For  Yeah  That's funny  He was gone  For about  Four or five months  Yeah  Yeah  Well the book  I mean  What I've read  I wish I would have  Read all of it  But I was doing gigs  For the weekend  But what I've read  I love  It's called  The Red Fox Story

Oh, my God 
[03:05:00]  Blacks  Philip and Patty  Those aren't blacks  They're savages  Savage red natives  Who, uh, we must, uh, conquer  They must be destroyed  Ping, ping, ping  When the landing in America  The pilgrims needed food  To eat and clean water  To drink  Except for the oldest 
[03:05:30]  Creepiest pilgrim  Who only needed  A case of fire water  To guzzle  During his podcast  They looked long and hard  For fresh food in the forest  And mainly gathered seeds  And berries to eat  The first winter in America  Was long and hard  Oh, may I have some of your seed  Pilgrim Anthony  Get the fuck away from me, wench  I'll shoot you dead  Dead!  But I'm hungry  I need something more to eat  So work for it  Many of the  Many of the pilgrims became ill 
[03:06:00]  Uh, oh, goodness  Pilgrim Patty  You're looking, uh, even worse than usual  Yes, I feel so ill  It must be from all the fucking  I've been doing with the native animals  Last night, Geronimo's horse  Stepped on the side of my face  While he was balls deep into my shit maker  Fucking Christ  She looks like a ghost  Finally, the winters passed 
[03:06:30]  And spring came  The pilgrims rejoiced  Yay!  One day, kind Indian  Came to the pilgrim's village  He liked the pilgrims  And wanted to chip in  What's that?  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  He liked the pilgrims  And wanted to chip in  What's that?  He liked the pilgrims  And wanted to help  Helped?  What is he?  A Beatles record or something? 
[03:07:00]  Soon more Indians came  I hope they were using rubbers or something  And I wonder if all the Indians  Were from Cleveland  I can't eat asparagus  Because it makes my teepee smell  Shut up, Chip  Shut up, Chip  I got so many feathers on my head  I got so many feathers on my head  Looks like a bunch of birds  Are doing the Watusi or something  I hate Chip  As I was saying  Soon more Indians arrived 
[03:07:30]  And the boy  Were those Indians  A bunch of dummies  The smallest of Indians was called Bobo  He was their special friend  He was their special friend  The Indians and pilgrims agreed to live in peace and harmony  Christ on a pony 
[03:08:00]  A shrunken-headed little monster  A horribly run-into-the-ground character  And a retarded Jewish Indian chief  I think I just discovered Long Island  All we're missing is a 500-pound stutter with apple butter in his arteries  Yeah, that's right  Hey, what, do you need help or something?  No, thank you, Indian  I'm fine  Yeah, you look pretty good  Must have been a grim pill you swallowed to be a pilgrim  You're a pretty funny Indian  What's that?  You're a pretty funny Indian 
[03:08:30]  Yeah, I'd like to cut your tits off  Because they're small and stupid  Not like my mutters  Which are big and full of milk  The pilgrims and the Indians learn to negotiate together  Ah, hey  Can we buy all this land from you guys?  We're prepared to offer you  A mouthful of drool  A mangled penis  And smallpox  Well, if you throw in some acting classes 
[03:09:00]  And a feeding bag I could eat oats out of  You got a deal  He stinks at acting  Yeah  Hold on, that's my line  Yeah  And a dryer door, too, or something  See, that would have been much better  But he stepped  One Indian became so excited about the new deal 
[03:09:30]  He achieved a full erection  It's a deal  No  No  Right here  Sorry about that  Until later on  When the Indians realized  He had been taken advantage of  We, we, we, we, we, we need 
[03:10:00]  All right, take this  You dumb phones  Hey, hey, pilgrim Anthony, you ripped me off  I want my freaking land back, all right?  Uh, yeah  Well, I want you to replace the boots I rode  When I stepped in a pile of Mr. Maloonigan's shit  Fuck you  And fuck your hyperallergenic dog  Aw, shit  Fuck, fuck, yo 
[03:10:30]  Some foley artist  Bang  And then the Green Ripper makes his first appearance of the Thanksgiving holiday  Bobo is dead and being carried off stage by  What's up with Kenny?  Help me, help me, I'm retarded  Now I have paint all over my shitty big suit 
[03:11:00]  Kenny's not going to be happy with that  There's paint all over his shoulder  There's paint all over my suit  Like, who's going to pay for this?  All right, uh  Once that problem was solved  They became worried about the approaching winter  Jeez, it's getting breezy  Like, I don't know, there's a breeze in here or something?  I don't know  Here's the thing 
[03:11:30]  Speak up  Here's the thing, here's the thing  My wig won't  My wig won't burn down  Because my wig got distracted  You suck it out, dude  Excuse me, I'm getting emotional here  The thing is, my wig won't burn down  Because my wife got distracted  While she was fucking three warriors from the Wu-Tang tribe  If  If we all work together  I can rebuild my poorly furnished home 
[03:12:00]  And afford to have her vagina stitched back to a size I can use again  We need to pull together  Can you say stitched again?  Stitched  You want to pull something?  Why don't you pull some taffy or something?  Jesus  Well, Mitch, maybe you can pull something  Heavy?  I don't know what's heavy  Something like that  Hey, you know what?  You need to stop your horrible jokes and get your shit together  What are you going to  I can't see you  Let me get my glasses  Hold on 
[03:12:30]  Hold on  Okay  I told you we shouldn't have had any Jews in this place  What are you going to tell us  What are you going to tell us next?  That if the Jews walked two more miles  We'd have all the oil  This is our time  This is when we separate the men from the boys  What are they, stuck together or something?  You got to separate them?  They stuck together like this taffy on them?  Together, the pilgrims and Indians hunted quail and turkey 
[03:13:00]  So they would be ready to  Oh, so they would be ready for the  Can we wait to  Go, go, go, go, go, go  Oh, yeah  Iraq has the turkey  That's what I do when I see food  I go, go, go, go  Oh, shit  Hey, look, it's a pig with feathers  No, no  It's a huge, fat, meaty, worthless turkey  That doesn't deserve to be alive  It looks stupid and lazy 
[03:13:30]  But there's just so much meat  Without question  This clearly metaphorical turkey  Would serve to satisfy us greater in death  I'm from Florida  I have conquered the largest, fattest, dumbest, laziest, least heterosexual turkey  Any of us has ever seen  We will dine like kings 
[03:14:00]  Someone get my knife so I can cut off its hooves and pickle them  Eat me  Eat me and stuff me with your fists  Treat me like the fat, blundering turkey I am  Fill me up with your deliciousness  Jesus  Jesus  Boy, this turkey is  This turkey is fucking fat  I hope he gets run over by a bus and killed or something  Sorry 
[03:14:30]  When the summer ended, the pilgrims wanted to have a feast  Do you speak clearly?  When the summer ended, the pilgrims wanted to have a feast  And there were even rumors that Adam Sandler might show up  But the pilgrims later found out  That it was a lie the booker told  Just to get a lesser Indian's book at the feast  Words really do hurt  They had plenty of food after killing the fat turkey 
[03:15:00]  And many of your friends  They wanted to give thanks  Hey dummies who sold us your land for a fraction of its cost  Want to have a big feast and share some oversized turkey?  We call it Thanksgiving  It will be a very special holiday  Iraq's now on the table  Is the turkey  Thanksgiving?  How about we call it your welcome giving?  Should I take a hike, please?  Yeah, I'll leave a hike first  Then maybe I'll take a hike  Then there won't be any tolls or nothing  I don't know, I'm just winging it  Is the turkey cooked cock 
[03:15:30]  Is the turkey's cock like meat or dog meat?  I like them both  But I can only fit the night meat into my fault box  Either way, I want the cock  I fucking hate her  I need her  Fucking, even in English  That English accent, her voice still stinks  She's taking the fun out of it  Jesus  Well, growing up in Florida  You can't read lying down, fatso 
[03:16:00]  I never thought I would end up  He's supposed to be the dead turkey  Growing up in Florida  I never thought I would end up dead on a table  Then again, I also didn't think I would be this fat  Or inept  I'm really sleepy because sometimes  I'm too lazy to get up and go to the fridge  So I eat my own duty  Which has tryptophan in it  Tryptophan  Did the fan hurt himself when you tripped him? 
[03:16:30]  Shut the fuck up, Jim  Did the dead turkey just talk?  Yes, and so did the retard  Oh shit, I forgot I'm dead  Even after I die, I can't stop making mistakes  Seriously though, how is this table supporting my massive weight?  This is fucking mean  This truly is a day for all of us to give thanks  Hey, Pilgrim Anthony  You fucking stink at Anthony 
[03:17:00]  You fucking  It says to look at Anthony  And Rich Voss looked the other way  You need your other pair of glasses, you old fucking twat  So glad the glasses are working  Hey, Pilgrim Anthony  Why is my 12-year-old Indian daughter coming out of your quarters?

Nobody understands you  Go slower  Die, old man  The pilgrim enjoyed his first Thanksgiving feast  And it was that meal  Enjoying of people  That we celebrate every single year  As the meal drew to a close  It was the dumbest Indian of all  Bobo  Who came down from the heavens  To remind everyone  The true meaning  Of what we had  Just happened  Guys, the true meaning 
[03:21:30]  Is to be thankful  For everything we've got today  For on this day  It could have been a lot worse  To be thankful  I myself  I'm thankful  To be alive today  On this day  On this earth  And for people like  Like Anthony Voss  And  Anthony Voss  My daughter's kid  No, no, no

[03:24:00]  That I'd gotten to  Listen to that skit  Because obviously  We were performing  And we could  I mean I wasn't performing  But I was definitely  Working as crew  I couldn't really enjoy it  And just sit back  And listen to it  It's pretty god damn funny  It's After Opie and Anthony Live  I'm Sam Roberts  After Opie and Anthony Live  Is brought to you by  Trojan Bearskin Condoms  Trojan  America's  Number one  Most trusted condom brand  Eric  Was that  Did you listen to the replay 
[03:24:30]  Because I didn't listen  To the hard rock replays  I guess  So did you  Was that the first time  You kind of heard it  Yes and no  I kind of turned it off  When I was in the back  Doing other stuff  Oh you didn't  You didn't even want to hear it  Nah not really  You got some big laughs  I know  The Florida line killed  Well thank you for writing that one  I don't know what you're talking about  I thought that was improv  No  No no improv  I was told  Do not stray from the script  At all  Who told you that  That would be you  Oh  Well I thought it was  A strong enough script  That you know  You would get your laughs 
[03:25:00]  Your character would get over  And I think  That the turkey  Did indeed get over  And they weren't all my lines  For the record  You know  Jim Norton  At the last minute  Helped with some  Punching up  And you  Yeah I noticed the script  Added a few more pages  Once Jim got a hold of it  The turkey was a favorite character  Of his  I don't know  I think I got outshadowed  A little bit  By Rich Voss  Not having his glasses  And skipping his lines  And that's the thing  You have to realize  When you're doing a live stage show 
[03:25:30]  Is the element of unpredictability  That yeah  I mean  Maybe when you're writing the script  Your favorite character  Is the turkey  But once you get out on that stage  And all the elements  Come into play  You know  The live audience  The actors  The vision of the actors  The quality of the actors  Certain actors  Who have scripts  That are different  From everybody else  On the stage  That was Bobo  Whole new  Whole new things  Come into play  Voss for instance  When the script was written  We specifically wrote 
[03:26:00]  Long  Bits of dialogue  Because we wanted to see  Voss really perform it  Unfortunately  He just kind of  Monotonely read it  And yeah  With Bobo  Our gag  I don't even know  If it translated  I don't  We might have talked about it  On the after show before  I don't remember  But  The gag was  That Bobo  His script  He had many more lines  And didn't get killed  Unfortunately  Fortunately for him  We decided to go  With the script  That everybody else had  And Kenny had to 
[03:26:30]  Put him up on his shoulder  And carry him  In his loincloth  And body paint  Back into the audience  Not backstage  Had to sit Bobo down  Back into the audience  So he could sit with the people  And the Thanksgiving speech  That Bobo came up with  At the end  All improv  That was the  The only thing  Yeah that's right  The only thing that was  On the script was  Bobo improvises  A Thanksgiving speech  Which Bobo received  Five minutes  Before he improvised  That very speech  I noticed a lot of 
[03:27:00]  So hats off to Bobo  Because that was a hell  I mean a hell of a way  To capture  The real meaning  Of Thanksgiving  And I'm glad  That that's something  That we revisited  On today of all days  I noticed he's really good  Under pressure  Because I mean  He kept getting told  That he had to stretch it out  Longer and longer  Because we kept getting  The times wrong  Well that's the problem  That we were  The thing about  The Opie and Anthony show  Is if nothing else  It's precise  And all of our segments  Are timed out to the T  Whether it's an interview 
[03:27:30]  Whether it's a comedy bit  We're doing  Everything to a T  Is precisely timed  So that everything  Has room  Everything is as funny  As possible  Everything is what  It's supposed to be  So when Bobo  Got up there  And started doing  His speech  He thought he was  Going to end  After like a minute  And a half  And yeah  Travis and me  We had to  Make sure that Bobo  Was told to stretch it out  And keep going  We need to keep  This speech going  Because right now  The audience is demanding  More Thanksgiving spirit 
[03:28:00]  And luckily Bobo  Was there to supply  Them with that  I hope everybody  Can pick up  On the sarcasm  And facetiousness  Of the way I'm saying things  But maybe they can't  And that's fine too  They don't know  What facetious means  Is that  Did I go over  Some people's heads  With that one  Probably  I don't know  If anyone's listening  They probably think  We went to worst of  Nobody's listening  This is what people  Don't understand  They assume nobody's listening  And that's why I get people  To say stupid things  On this show a lot  But a lot of people  Sex man 
[03:28:30]  A lot of people  Are listening  Because even when  That's good  Even when O&A  Is in worst of  Still a lot of people  Listening  This is a very  Listen to channel  These secure  Cupcakes are so  Fucking delicious  Steve Rowland  You're in a sugar  Hi Rowland  You're in a sugar coma  Yeah I mean  Paul's mom  One trick pony  You think so  100%  My mom brought in  Or had me bring in  More treats today  Yeah  I told her not to  Because the thing 
[03:29:00]  That's been happening  Lately is  My mom  My mom brought in  Baked goods  A long time ago  And then  For some reason  Opie decided  Opie, Anthony, and Jim  I gotta give everybody  Equal credit  That the appropriate  Thing to do  Would be  To call her  And say nasty  Things to her  And then  When Paul  Who's here sometimes  He's like a part time  Guy  He's been on  He gets kicked off  He got kicked off  The after show  The last two days  I'm sure you remember  Me kicking someone off  That was Paul  When Paul 
[03:29:30]  Wanted to get a little  Attention for himself  He decided to bring in  Some baked goods  Because he saw  My mom get the heat  She called that  Baked goods  You can't even do that  Can you  Because the first day  I call it heartburn starters  He brought it in  He brought it in  With pre-cooked  Store bought  Crust  If you want to call them that  Yeah  It's like pure butter  Right  And then the second time  He brought them in  It was not even a real crust  It was just a graham cracker  Crumble practically  Smashed down to the bottom 
[03:30:00]  And just more key lime bullshit  It was like  You could taste the key lime  But it was like  Ugh  I'm getting  Eric  I might be  Misinformed  Several people are right now  Feedbacking in  I'm not listening  So maybe to answer you  Maybe to answer your question  They're not  But so now that  Now that there's a  Because the thing about  Baked goods is  When there's no other  Baked goods around  Whatever baked goods there are  Are great  And delicious 
[03:30:30]  But once a basis of comparison  Is brought in  You have a real competition  And Roland  My mom brought in  Or my mom had me bring in  Chocolate cakes  They're not like  Cupcakes  They're mini cakes  And carrot cake cupcakes  So good  And I mean  They've been made short work of  There were two big tins of them  Enough for  Several shows  Not just this show  But we're running low on both  Fuck the other shows  And Roland  You've taken sides 
[03:31:00]  In the war of the moms  Your mom's like  Michelangelo  And Paul's mom's like  Michael Dumjalo  Michael Dumjalo  Very clever  Travis have you sampled the cakes  I see you're going for a plate  Well  I see  You came in here and I saw  Danny wants a chocolate cake  Oh Danny  Oh wait wait  Is that the last one  Yeah  Aww  No Roland  Are you really gonna do that to him  Yes  Oh wow  Roland you already had one  So  They'll get in between  Roland and his food 
[03:31:30]  He's been eyeing that thing  Travis have you  Did you try any of my mom's treats  Any of the cakes  You know what  I'm not a big fan of carrot cake  But I might just take  Just take one for the road maybe  You're gonna take one for the road  A little road ski  Before they're all gone  I may have had one already  You may have had one  But you also may have had three  And one chocolate  That's true  So this will be  Wait wait  Did you  What's the count now  Is this the fourth carrot cake  Well I mean  Are we really keeping count  It's fifth isn't it  No  Four 
[03:32:00]  No that's ridiculous  Five would be silly  If you factor in the one chocolate cake you had  Then the number comes to  Five  Okay five  Five cakes  The way I see it is  We've been here since six  Right  It's gonna be eleven  Actually Travis  Some of us have been here since five  No I mean the cakes have been here since six  Oh okay  Because some of us set our alarm clocks in the morning  Most of us usually do  Most of us did for seven years  And decided one day 
[03:32:30]  Nah  Who needs an alarm  Who needs an alarm  Travis got here a little late today  Don't even plug the phone in  But you got here  And I'm sure you had the  I'm late panics  Because those are the worst  Yeah but you know what  They really subside over time  Especially on this show  Yeah that's what I'm saying  It's like  If this was like five years ago  And I woke up at the time that I did  But, like, I've got most of my work done already.  I really just have to come in and print it out.  And how much of it? 
[03:33:00]  I'm getting a phone call.  What's WA?  Washington.  I'm getting a phone call from Kent Washington on my cell phone.  Oh, it's probably Kent the movie guy.  Oh.  Thank God.  I will not be picking that up.  Why is it?  I hope they leave a voicemail because that was strange.  Yeah, I mean, and they don't even use half the work.  So it doesn't really matter.  But you got here.  Yeah.  And there's treats for you.  And I was like, well, look at this.  Here we go.  It's a good thing I woke up.  And what's the, I mean, carrots are nutritious, right?  So why not have a carrot cake? 
[03:33:30]  Or four.  I only had two.  They're delicious, Roland.  Have another.  I might just do it.  They're good for you.  And it's cream cheese icing, so that's healthy.  Yeah, everyone knows cream cheese is good for you.  And there's three carrots on top, too.  No, you know, those aren't carrots.  That's orange icing in the shape of a carrot.  That's a carrot, right?  A carrot's a carrot.  Do three icing carrots equal one real carrot?  I believe so.  Okay.  If you have all three, yeah.  One baby carrot.  Okay.  Get it free.  I've been telling everybody they're sugar-free.  That is a lie.  I don't know if anybody believes me.  At least I'll be up for the meeting. 
[03:34:00]  Yeah, you'll be awake for the meeting.  You'll be all sugar-rushed.  I know, but wait.  It's at noon.  I'm going to have a comfort sugar down.  Eric, have you had a carrot cake?  No, I didn't.  Why?  I didn't want one.  They're so good.  I'm sure they are.  Just eat one.  He's trying to watch his figure.  By the way.  It's not.  It's Thanksgiving week.  Do you know Eric had extra lunch yesterday?  Well, he pre-gamed before Chick-fil-A.  Do you remember when you did that?  Yeah, because I forgot it was Chick-fil-A.  Well, yesterday.  I took your order and then you ate lunch. 
[03:34:30]  I forgot.  No, I had it with me, but I forgot that we were doing that.  So you figure, well, I got it here.  You just heard the skit from the Hard Rock the other day, the Thanksgiving skit.  Well, in order to tell us that we did a good job, one of the bosses here, Gary, said he'll  get us lunch.  He'll get the whole staff lunch.  So whoever on the staff, I got it.  But you got to decide where you're going to go because we're going to one place.  I'll pay for lunch.  It'll all be good.  And there is one Chick-fil-A in all of New York City. 
[03:35:00]  It's a Chick-fil-A Express.  Yeah.  It's not even a full Chick-fil-A.  But that is on the campus of NYU of all places.  And it's like 20 minutes away from here, even on the subway.  So we never get to go.  But Chick-fil-A, there's nothing like Chick-fil-A.  And you, Travis, haven't even had it before.  Never had it.  First time.  So this was like something I did.  We're going to sit and talk.  I might as well just try this.  Have a carrot cake.  Might as well have a carrot cake.  So I did a little politicking.  And I got Chick-fil-A. 
[03:35:30]  I know.  You're sitting.  You're saying, Sam, you guys are in Manhattan.  And, you know, this is the restaurant capital of the world.  Yes.  Of all places.  It better be a great place.  You know where Bobo likes to eat when he's in Manhattan.  Yeah.  Well, when we did win a date with Bobo.  Bobo and his date went to Dave & Buster's in Times Square.  And Bobo looked at his date and he said, you know, it's really nice.  I usually don't get to have a good Manhattan lunch.  At Dave & Buster's. 
[03:36:00]  At Dave & Buster's in Times Square.  That's the best.  Dave & Buster's in Times Square is Bobo's New York lunch on the town.  Like Michael Scott with Sbarro.  Exactly.  It's my favorite little New York pizza place.  Sbarro's.  But so, yeah, we decided of all the of all the places we could go to in New York, Chick-fil-A had to be the place.  I mean, that's the one.  So we went down there.  Well, we didn't go down there.  We called in the order and sent stupid Matt the intern, which I'll tell you about in a second. 
[03:36:30]  He's not Eric.  Don't send him in here.  I never sent him.  Okay, because I'm going to tell a story about him, what he said right before we went on the air in an obvious attempt to get on the air.  But we won't be discussing it with him.  But so we get the Chick-fil-A.  Where are you going?  I was choked up.  No, he's not going in.  Sit down.  Is he sitting down?  He is now.  Why would he go in?  Because he goes, I'm going to go in.  Ask him why he was going to go in.  Why were you going to go in? 
[03:37:00]  On my own accord.  Tell him he's not welcome.  You're not welcome in there.  I don't understand.  Face the wall.  Okay, he knows that there is no his own accord.  Like this.  Yes.  If he comes in here, this is my house, okay?  From until 11 a.m., this studio is my house.  And if he comes in here, I'm going to consider it breaking and entering.  And I'm going to shoot him in his heart.  I was going to say you can shoot him.  I'm going to shoot him in the heart if he comes in here. 
[03:37:30]  And not with some kind of play thing.  With a bullet.  With a gun and a bullet.  But Anthony left a gun here for me if I ever need it.  You should stab him like he's a vampire.  I'm going to shoot him in the heart with a silver bullet.  That's so Twilight of you.  Eric's all excited he's going to see Twilight over vacation.  Loser.  I've never seen him.  I saw him.  You're going to see all of them?  Yeah, I'll see them all in one shot.  You have so many movies that you should watch.  And you're going to watch Twilight.  I've never seen...  No, I don't care about Twilight.  Listen, we get a Chick-fil-A. 
[03:38:00]  And...  I mean, listen.  Some of us might have ordered a little extra.  Because you know what?  Did you?  It's 50 Chicken Biscuit Day.  Maybe you order enough to make sure there's leftovers.  That's the vibe that I felt.  Okay?  I thought we were all kind of...  Order, you know...  Order like a big kid lunch.  And if you weren't going to finish everything, you bring it home for leftovers.  I ate everything I ordered.  You did?  Yes.  I might have had enough for a little leftovers.  Maybe enough to go home and have a nice vacation lunch today. 
[03:38:30]  Maybe that's what I'm doing.  Okay?  See, that doesn't interest me.  What doesn't?  Day-old, like, fast food.  Yeah, no.  I...  Let me...  I'm going to get home.  And I'm going to be like, oh, I'm tired.  I want to eat.  But I don't want to have a full meal.  I'm going to open the fridge.  And there's going to be...  Maybe it's a full box of chicken nuggets sitting in the fridge.  Maybe that's what it is.  A little four-piece?  Well, they come 12 pieces.  No.  It's just sitting in the fridge.  And I'm going to say, thank God for that. 
[03:39:00]  I'm going to put WWE 12 in PlayStation 3 because I got, like, two more weeks before I'm tired  of all video games again.  So I'm going to play that.  I'm going to eat my Chick-fil-A, and it's going to be a great start to the vacation.  I haven't played it yet.  It's good.  It's awesome.  Yeah, it's really good.  I would recommend it to anybody who plays wrestling games.  Or used to play wrestling games.  You play it yet?  I'm going to start this weekend.  All right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Maybe we'll play together because we're on Xbox.  Yes.  Oh, that's exciting.  Yeah, maybe we can do some tag team.  I hope you kick the shit out of the sex room. 
[03:39:30]  Yeah.  And then play video games.  That's funny, Eric.  This is a funny joke.  Good one.  But yeah, I mean, the vibe I felt was 50 Chicken Biscuit Day, which, if you remember  that story, you'll enjoy that.  And if not...  I've got to find that photo again.  Yeah, one day we'll...  I've explained it on the after show.  I did it.  I mean, if you don't know that story by now, then I feel bad for you.  But...  I took the worst shit ever yesterday because of Chick-fil-A.  How much did you...  What did you order from Chick-fil-A?  Just a sandwich.  You had one sandwich. 
[03:40:00]  I only got a sandwich.  And buffalo sauce.  Oh, and coleslaw.  You got coleslaw, too.  And then complained that they didn't put cheese on it.  The coleslaw did it?  Well, no.  They didn't put cheese on it.  It was, like, plain.  Well, yeah.  I mean, it's all about the chicken.  But it's not like the picture...  If there was cheese rolling, it would not have shit.  That's what I'm saying.  Because in the picture, it's totally different than what we ordered.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it's like false advertisements.  Chick-fil-A.  Did you think the coleslaw gave you the shits?  Probably the food.  Bunch of assholes.  False advertisements.  Why do you have such venom?  Because they didn't put cheese on your sandwich. 
[03:40:30]  Because I want that.  Like the picture.  I got nothing like the picture.  So what do you think of Chick-fil-A?  Fuck them!  Because they didn't put cheese on it.  I had a friend who used to not get cheese on his Whopper to save 10 cents  and then go home and put his own slice of cheese on it.  Very smart.  Because, I mean, think about it this way.  How long does it take you to eat 10 Whoppers?  Maybe two months?  Three months?  Yeah.  In those longings.  I mean, think about it that way.  Roland, why don't you...  I want you in a good mood. 
[03:41:00]  Why don't you calm down and have a little carrot cake?  Thank you.  Okay, yeah.  He is.  My nerves.  He's going for a carrot cupcake.  Good for you, Roland.  Good choice.  Well, yeah.  I mean, I ordered a couple orders of nuggets.  I thought I was going to eat both.  I thought I was going to have both in one sitting.  But as it turned out, I had enough for extra.  I had a sandwich, nuggets, and fries.  Was that a lot?  You did?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  No wonder you're getting so fat.  That's what you had?  You had a sandwich, nuggets, and fries. 
[03:41:30]  Yeah.  And Roland just had a sandwich.  What a fad.  And coleslaw.  And coleslaw.  You're so fat.  Roland, your mouth is full.  It's so good.  So we all did our orders, and everybody was going out to get the food.  It was just so good.  Chick-fil-A is the best.  It really is.  But I walked in, and Eric was eating a giant Tupperware full of salad.  And I go, Eric.  I'm salad inside of tears.  I go, Eric, what are you doing?  And Eric goes, well, I forgot I had this.  And so he was eating a massive Tupperware. 
[03:42:00]  I was starving, and I didn't know when Matt was taking fucking forever.  He was already gone.  You knew he would be back.  No, he wasn't gone yet.  He was gone.  He was absolutely already gone.  No, he was not.  Yes, he was.  20 minutes was his limit.  Yeah.  And he's, I'm starving now.  See, we theorized.  This is where the theory in the office was, Eric.  And you tell me if I'm wrong.  Okay.  We theorized that your wife makes the salad for you because she wants you to eat healthy.  And if that salad isn't eaten when she gets home, then she knows that you ate a lunch that wasn't nutritious. 
[03:42:30]  So you said, oh, shit, I got to eat this salad.  So you ate the salad, and then you also had the lunch that wasn't nutritious.  What did you have from Chick-fil-A?  I had just a regular sandwich, and you talked me into the chicken nuggets because you said, 
[03:43:00]  you're not having chicken nuggets, and I go, oh, you're right.  So you had nuggets and a sandwich.  Yeah.  And a giant meal-sized salad.  I didn't finish the nuggets, though.  How many did you eat?  I had about four, and then I gave them away.  Who'd you give them away to?  To Mikey Piff.  What is it with you and Mikey Piff?  Are you dating?  Maybe.  You're giving him wrestling tickets?  You're giving him food?  Enough.  If I had known there were extra nuggets, I would have put them in the fridge next to my other  extra nuggets.  Did you finish the salad?  Yeah.  Yeah, he made short work of that, but he was done with the salad before the Chick-fil-A even 
[03:43:30]  got there.  Did you win any friends?  What?  Come on, Eric.  He gave you a Simpsons set up.  Same thing's just for you.  You don't win friends with salad?  Oh, fuck.  Yeah, right.  Come on, dude.  Don't sleep behind the wheel with Simpsons.  I forgot about that one.  You have to do it in a conga beat next time.  Is that what happened, Eric?  Does your wife get mad at you if you don't eat your salad because she wants you to eat  nutritious?  Yes.  No, not because she wants me to eat nutritious. 
[03:44:00]  It's that she made the whole thing, and I was like, oh, fuck.  I'll eat it.  But I told her, I told her, too, that I was like, yeah, I had Chick-fil-A as well.  What did she say to that?  And she just went, when will you learn?  She just looked at me, and she just went, oh.  She just sighed.  Now, did you tell her this over dinner?  No.  Yes.  What did you have for dinner?  What did I have for dinner?  Oh, for dinner? 
[03:44:30]  For dinner.  Listen, I'm not going to stop you, because I had like a fat kid yesterday, okay?  I had Chick-fil-A, then it was my brother's birthday yesterday, so we went to my parents'  house and had pizza.  Ooh.  That's good.  I mean, you know, I had one order of nuggets for lunch, and then I had two slices of pizza  for dinner.  I had taquitos.  You had taquitos?  The frozen ones that are in the bag.  How many?  From Trader Joe's?  Eight taquitos.  They're tiny, though.  For lunch.  What are taquitos?  Oh, from Trader Joe's?  They're like rolled up, uh, no.  How can anybody, how can anyone give me shit about what, so you for lunch? 
[03:45:00]  Yeah.  Had an order of, you had an Eric lunch, you had, you had, you had, it's taquitos, it's  little mini soft tacos.  Yeah.  You had, you throw them in the oven.  You had, uh, chicken sandwich.  With lettuce and tomato.  You had an order and a half of chicken nuggets, because you ate, you had an order of chicken  nuggets.  I had some that were from the table.  Right, for the table.  So you had an order.  Taquitos is like, hang on, hang on, hang on, you had an order of chicken nuggets, an order  and a half, and waffle fries. 
[03:45:30]  Yeah.  And then you went home for dinner and had eight taquitos, and Roland, what was the equation  for the taquitos?  It's like having two normal ones.  Yeah.  What do you mean?  Two?  Two regular taquitos.  Like, if you're in Mexico, you ask one of my people to make you taquitos, there'd be  like eight small ones.  Yeah.  Just two.  Yeah, I mean, you're talking about, like, you know, very thin.  Yeah, but you had eight of them.  Well, I was hungry.  We ate at like eight o'clock.  So your insides just must be so mad at you.  No, I'm fine.  You are. 
[03:46:00]  You're feeling good?  Yeah.  Feeling healthy?  Feeling good.  And what'd you have for breakfast today?  Five cupcakes.  Oh, I love your metabolism, Eric.  You just get upset.  Oh, trust me, it's going.  It is.  Yeah, of course it is.  I've put on like 20 pounds in the last two years.  I see that you've, but you're okay with that.  Yeah, what are you going to do?  You're like, it's time to just gain some weight?  With dad.  Yeah, you're good.  Are you going to start exercising?  No.  No, you're just, you're down to ride.  Yeah.  Whatever, whatever, you feel like whatever God's plan for you is. 
[03:46:30]  I'm along for the ride.  I love that.  I love that philosophy.  Eric, what did you have for dinner?  Well, I got home.  Couldn't be worse than me, Eric.  Yeah, I actually could.  I had a BLT.  Oh my God.  And I had potato soup.  Potato soup.  Potato soup.  Oh, from where?  This specialty thing I got at Sam's Club.  Did your wife get...  What's in potato soup?  It's delicious.  It's baked potato soup. 
[03:47:00]  So it's just potatoes and water?  No, it's like bacon and all that.  Is that what it is?  Yeah, it's got...  So good.  I don't know what potato soup is.  You had a BLT.  Bacon, broccoli, you know, like what you would put on a baked potato.  Yeah, it's so fucking good.  You had a BLT and then a soup with bacon in it?  Yeah.  Dude, that...  Do you have the...  They're so good.  Do you have the bacon strips promo that you did?  Yeah, it's in there.  Oh, let me see.  Yeah, see if you have that.  Don't let him lie to you and say it's not in there.  It's in there?  Sam, the soup is fucking...  Eric introduced me to the soup.  It's fan-fucking-tastic.  Sounds good.  I mean, Roland is a foodie. 
[03:47:30]  I don't eat soups.  You don't?  No, no soup.  I probably would have had some potato soup with my taquitos last night.  Kooligans.  That's where I first had it.  It was so good.  Oh, that one's good.  Oh, my God.  Hooligans?  Oh, is it hooligans or hooligans?  Hooligans.  Hooligans.  It's hooligans.  Oh, that's hooligans.  Oh, I wonder...  Does...  Eric, you can look for that, you know, but...  I'm looking.  Does your wife get upset with your choices of diet?  Because Eric, I think a year ago, he announced that he was going to see a personal trainer. 
[03:48:00]  And by that, I mean once.  Because he obviously gave that up.  He saw the personal trainer.  Yeah, he saw him.  I went through the sessions.  Yes, because there were...  The gym had windows.  So he saw the personal trainer from the pizza restaurant next door.  By who hands?  But his wife is the one who kind of...  She gave that to him as a gift, if I remember.  It was either a birthday gift or a Christmas gift.  And it was one of those things.  Like, if Jess...  That's not a gift.  Right.  If Jess gave me personal training sessions or like, you know, look, I got you a new wardrobe 
[03:48:30]  from J.Crew.  It's the same.  It's like, this is what you want me to wear.  I don't...  Why would I...  That's not a gift for you.  Why would I want a wardrobe from J.Crew?  Eric didn't want...  No, he wanted DVDs.  Exactly.  And taquitos.  And taquitos.  You got me nine bags of taquitos.  You're the best.  That would be a good question.  I'm going to try taquitos now.  You should.  I'm surprised you haven't had them.  I've never had them.  Why don't you go to Trader Joe's?  They're so fucking good.  I might.  But so, obviously...  Oh, my God.  Love it.  Eric's wife has a vested interest in him getting into shape. 
[03:49:00]  I would assume she's feeling some frustration because the harder she tries, the more it doesn't  work.  If I remember correctly, she had you on the South Beach diet at one point.  No, she didn't have me.  I said I was going to try it.  No, no.  And it didn't work.  Sam, they went to South Beach.  Oh, and then Eric ate a lot.  No, Eric.  It's delicious.  You said to yourself, you know what would be a good idea for me for personal help would 
[03:49:30]  be the South Beach diet.  I saw the book and I was like, all right.  No way, dude.  Yeah, we had it in the kitchen.  In 2011, you thought the South Beach diet was something you should try?  Hey, look.  Nothing else was really working.  No, it wasn't.  And then you got to chapter two and it said no sandwiches.  And you went, this is not going to work out.  Went right to the goodwill.  What are you laughing at?  You like that, Roland?  He's laughing that someone tried a diet. 
[03:50:00]  Yeah, fuck it.  What the hell?  So does your wife get upset when you come home and say, I had the salad, but then I also  had a meal big enough for two from Chick-fil-A?  It wasn't big enough for two.  Nuggets and a sandwich?  Yeah, that's two things.  Nuggets are not a, there's a difference between chicken nuggets and french fries, all right?  And I'm not letting Travis off, just because Travis ate it doesn't mean it's a meal for  one.  Wait, should we tell him about the McDonald's pregame or no?  What McDonald's pregame? 
[03:50:30]  McDonald's.  We didn't have McDonald's yesterday.  No, one time, way back, we went to, we had to go meet with my wife for dinner.  We were by McDonald's.  So we picked up a little wrap.  You picked up a wrap on the way to dinner?  No, we both, trust me, I don't remember, I'm sure we did, I don't remember that, but  if it was a wrap, yeah, you get the...  Those Big Mac wraps are good.  It's so good.  Oh, no, those, no.  Those should destroy my stomach.  How did she...  You get the grilled chicken ranch wrap.  Those are good, too.  How did she feel about when you come home and say, and I had Chick-fil-A? 
[03:51:00]  Yeah, but do you really think, like, he tells her?  He said he did.  I did, I told her yesterday.  He said he did.  He just went, oh, and that was it.  She doesn't like that.  She gets annoyed?  Well, look, she put all that work into making the salad for me, so I think she was just  appreciative that I ate it, which was delicious.  Salads are good.  Yeah, but you know what?  You're supposed to just eat the salad.  That's why she made it.  You know what?  I'll make a salad that's hearty enough that it will be Eric's full lunch, and then she 
[03:51:30]  finds out that then you had a meal and a half from Chick-fil-A directly after the salad.  Hey, things happen.  Hey, boys gotta eat, am I right, Eric?  I forgot it was Chick-fil-A day.  So you ate the salad?  You didn't want to hurt her feelings?  Well, no, I brought the salad in, I put it in the fridge and everything, and we're doing  the show, and then at one point, Travis, or Roland, says that they need my Chick-fil-A  order, and I went, fuck, I forgot it was Chick-fil-A day.  Eric, I took your order as you were hot-stepping it over to the bathroom at 11 o'clock. 
[03:52:00]  Roland asked me earlier, and then you asked me later.  You had this shit?  Yeah.  You had this shit at 11?  Yeah.  Eric's power walking to the bathroom, and I asked him what he wanted from Chick-fil-A,  and then 10 minutes later, he was eating a salad.  It smelled delicious, though, the salad.  It did.  Yeah.  Were you a little jealous?  Fuck yeah.  And Roland also is trying to get Eric fatter.  Of course he is.  Yes, he is.  I believe that to be true.  Roland hasn't specifically said that to me, but I think that Roland, I mean, no, no, no.  I'm not saying Roland is a thin guy, but I think that Roland is trying to encourage Eric's 
[03:52:30]  bad behavior, because he wants to see Eric get fat.  Again, maybe I'm really-  Roland's a terrible influence, and Eric is the easiest person to influence.  Maybe Roland's just a bad influence, and I'm looking too much into it, because Roland  has not said this to me, but I believe that to be true.  Roland?  No, it just said, like, you have two foodies.  Hey, why don't you go here?  Is it awesome?  I go, yeah.  Is it awesome?  Eric, is he on the phone?  Is he on the phone? 
[03:53:00]  Do you consider yourself a foodie?  The what?  I'm sorry.  What happened?  Who was that?  Rob Cross.  What did he want?  Something about Steven Singer.  Go ahead.  Steven Singer?  Yeah.  What was it about Steven Singer?  Was it that I did the read at the end of the show?  No, you have one more read left, right?  Yeah.  Okay, because apparently Steven Singer wants a new bed to be used for the Steven Singer  read, so I just told him, give me the bed, and I'll play it.  He has his own specific bed?  Does he know for this show or for all reads?  I don't know.  He was going off about that, and then you called me, so I said, I have to go, and I turned 
[03:53:30]  the mic on.  Because I never use a bed when I do the Steven Singer reads on this show.  Well, apparently you're going to now.  So I can't start the Steven Singer.  Well, I don't have the bed, so do whatever you've got to do.  We'll start it next week if they don't have it.  Because I saw Rob go to Troy's studio.  Should I just do the read?  Probably.  I mean, you don't want to forget about it.  Maybe I'll give him a couple minutes to double check.  Sam, where do I buy silver?  Oh, Roland, you're tempting me.  You're tempting me, because you know I like to squeeze it in.  But you can't just get any silver. 
[03:54:00]  Stop tempting me.  I have to ask you.  Why don't you buy Jess's gift?  I have to ask Travis.  What's up?  How does your wife feel about you getting fatter?  She's fine.  She doesn't care?  No.  She's like, this is the way we go.  What's Troy doing?  Troy Kwan!  We were just talking about...  Are you getting fatter as you get older?  Am I?  Yeah.  Is he fucking thinner?  It's harder to keep off the weight.  It is.  Yeah.  Because Travis is getting fatter, but he also doesn't care.  Like, he doesn't give a fuck.  Right?  No.  Because he, for lunch yesterday, Travis ate, from Chick-fil-A, he ate an order and a half 
[03:54:30]  of nuggets, a chicken sandwich, waffle fries, and then for dinner he went home and had  eight taquitos.  That's great.  Yeah, but they're the little taquitos, you know?  He's got a great metabolism.  No, because...  No.  Travis, I said that too, and you're right, Travis, because look at you.  He used to...  He's thin.  Like, he's not like a fat guy, but he used to be much thinner.  Yeah.  But I also used to smoke too, and that keeps off weight, right? 
[03:55:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Smoking keeps off weight?  Yeah.  Why don't you start?  I don't have the money.  And I have a kid.  And health would be number two.  But more...  Yeah, exactly.  Because you're not caring about your health dietarily.  If you told me the world was ending in a month, I'd start smoking again.  Yeah.  Around your kid.  It's the best.  Yes.  What did you have from Chick-fil-A?  I just had a sandwich and a fry.  Because you can't handle the extra...  Well, I should have.  I was...  I actually pulled Travis aside, and I said, I wish somebody... 
[03:55:30]  Somebody would have...  Yeah, that's right.  What?  That's right.  I wish somebody would have let me know that I should probably double up on my order.  You got...  Yeah, Troy was upset that he didn't get nuggets too.  I thought...  That's true.  ...that I was going to eat both orders of nuggets in one sitting.  Right.  Turns out I only wanted one order.  Right.  So it brought the other home.  Yeah.  You know?  What else am I going to give it?  I'm not going to give it to Eric's boyfriend, Mikey Piff, and get Eric all jealous, you know?  I'm going to bring it home for myself.  Eric gave his extra food to Mikey Piff.  Oh, that's so sad. 
[03:56:00]  He took him to wrestling the other night too.  You really think Mikey Piff needs the extra food at this point?  You know what I mean?  Like, the Hits 1 crew...  Tight shirts.  It's a good-looking group of people.  You know, you got...  That's, I love them.  They wear tight shirts.  You got mashup Rich in there.  Rich Davis, who's the only guy, radio guy, who has to fix his hair during the commercial  breaks.  You know, Nicole, you know, you've all seen the pictures of her before.  Stanley T is cocoa buttering his skin every five seconds.  And twittering inspirational thoughts to everybody.  But then you got Mikey Piff, who looks like the type of guy who eats Eric's Chick-fil-A 
[03:56:30]  leftovers.  You know what I mean?  He looks like a guy that would hang with Eric, doesn't he?  No, yeah.  Like, they look like they would be best friends.  Except, is he like a pop culture Eric?  Yeah.  Except, what's funny about Eric is that he hangs out with people.  As much as Eric gets picked on here, Eric hangs out with people who he can pick on, who  kind of look up to Eric, and they think Eric's cool.  Because, like, Eric, he tries to get the interns to think he's cool because it sucks, because  Eric is a punching bag here. 
[03:57:00]  And, like, it's like Eric's not the cool guy on the show.  And, Eric, you're not insulted by that, right?  You understand?  Keep going.  Okay.  Well, who is the cool guy on the show?  Please, somebody, please tell me.  No, I think Troy's the guy who's trying to be the cool guy, and everybody thinks he's  a piece of shit.  But how am I, how am I, hang on, let me, I think, like, I think that, Eric, you can see  where I'm going with that, right?  Well, he hits on O.P. all the time.  I need you to, I need you to finish that statement and explain yourself.  How do I possibly come across as the cool guy when I don't ever really come in to the 
[03:57:30]  studio?  You're the guy, like, because when you do come in, it's always like, hey, man.  Why don't you go out and exercise a little bit?  Or, like, hey, why don't these guys ever just come in, like, you know, dress nicely a little  bit, you know?  Really?  Exactly.  Really?  Really?  Like, you, you come across as the guy who's, like, trying to be cool.  And I'm not saying you're not, but that's, like, I think the audience is like, oh, here  comes that piece of shit Troy again.  He's probably trying to be cool. 
[03:58:00]  That's what, I think that's what their perception is.  I think you're a great guy.  Thanks.  That's, I'm saying what the listener's perception is.  I've never picked up on it.  You guys haven't, because you laughed very hard on this.  I laughed in shock.  Oh, is that what that was?  It's like an awkward laughter.  You dick.  I'm just surprised you're going down a road like that.  Well, I'm just, he asked.  I just don't know what warrants that.  I don't ever ask to come in here.  I'm not saying that you're a mic whore. 
[03:58:30]  So if I just come in and just be myself, that's who I am.  That's what I'm saying.  All right.  Well, then I'm naturally a dick.  Yeah.  That's what Sam's saying.  Right.  That's what I'm saying.  Like, you're like, that's, that's the perception.  I think.  And that's fine.  I'm obviously accepting of it because we hang out.  You know what I mean?  Like, Eric's the punching bag.  And that's like, I don't think I'm like really stretching there.  But who's the cool guy?  I don't know who the cool guy is here.  It's not Eric.  It's not.  I mean, and you're like the guy who's like coming in as Fonz. 
[03:59:00]  But everybody's like, tell this guy to shut the fuck up.  Like, that's like, you know what I mean?  Like, you're almost like you would be the Fonz for a different audience.  But our audience is like, get this guy the fuck out of here.  I think.  Who do you think the cool guy is?  I don't know.  You're mad at me.  He's so sad.  You just do stupid shit like that.  What stupid shit?  You do stupid shit like that.  How come I can make fun of Eric and it's funny but like.  Yeah, but there's people that you don't even fucking come close to touching. 
[03:59:30]  Who's that?  Who won't I touch?  You know that.  Who won't I touch?  You know that.  Tell me.  You know there's people that you want to say some dumb shit to and you'll never.  You don't have the fucking balls to come out and say some dumb shit like that.  Who do you want me to describe?  Who do you want me to describe?  I'm not going down that road.  But you know that.  Oh, so I don't have the balls but you're not going down that road.  Well, you're the one that went down that road.  Who do you want me to describe that I want?  I don't want you to do anything.  Is it Travis?  Because I just said Travis is fat.  Who is it?  Is it Danny?  Because Danny would be... 
[04:00:00]  Danny's not the cool guy, but he also doesn't try to be the cool guy.  Danny is the guy who hates everything and gets in a fight with everyone.  But you'll never say what you really want to say.  What do I want to say?  I don't know.  What do you want to say?  This is crazy, Tom.  I'm sure he's trying to turn it around.  Yeah, what do I want to say?  I don't know.  What is it?  What are your real feelings?  I just said it.  Danny...  Are you talking about Danny?  Yeah.  Okay, okay.  Well, I'm glad that we uncovered that.  Because if I were in your position, I would have just said Danny. 
[04:00:30]  But Danny is a guy who is negative about everything and gets in a fight with everyone.  Okay?  Yeah.  I mean, is there anything I'm missing?  I don't know.  I mean, I go.  I go.  You're the one who's bringing this up.  Well, you're the one that started going down this road.  I want...  You said...  But you just...  No, no, no, no.  No, no, no.  You just have a lot of balls to go after people...  Yeah!  ...that you know aren't going to fight back.  You know that. 
[04:01:00]  You are fighting back right now!  No, you know that, though.  I'll go after everyone, Danny.  Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam, you know that.  You know who I go after.  Who know who I go after?  What are you just talking about?  You'll never say anything bad about him.  He's not in here.  But before...  And you know shit has happened, and you have kept your mouth shut about it.  Chicken shit.  If he comes in here...  Exactly.  Chicken shit.  If he comes in here...  Okay?  If he's on the air...  Hey, Troy, it's my big pussy.  If he's on the air...  Where did this come from?  Of course I'll go...  No, just because Sam likes to take his little bullshit shots, and it's like... 
[04:01:30]  But he's not...  And he's like, oh, I'm just honest with everything.  I'm honest with everything.  It's like, no, you're not, dude.  Who am I not honest?  Travis, when have I not taken shots at people?  All the time.  If Danny came out...  You hold back all the time.  I've taken shots at Danny constantly.  I've taken more shots at Danny than anyone.  Have you?  When?  I haven't heard him.  Well, then listen.  When have I not taken shots...  If I've ever had a...  Okay, well, Troy's upset that he's not...  That you don't think he's the cool guy.  No, no, no, no.  I think so!  He's gone crazy.  No, no, no.  I don't want you to think I'm the cool guy.  I never expect you to think I'm the cool guy. 
[04:02:00]  But I'm just like...  And you asked me who the cool guy was.  You just think it's funny just to take these little, like, sarcastic shots, and it's like...  It is funny.  That's why everybody laughs.  And it is funny.  And it is funny.  But then you're biased on who you give the shots to.  Yeah.  Because why...  If I go out there and say, you know what?  Danny gets into fights with everybody.  Yeah, but there's shit...  Then everybody around here is gonna go...  There's shit that's gone down.  Why the fuck would he say that?  There's shit that's gone down that you've kept your mouth shut about.  With everyone.  With everyone.  There isn't one person on this show who I don't know... 
[04:02:30]  There's stuff like...  Travis, Roland, you, Eric, Danny, Opie, Anthony, and Jim.  I have stuff on everybody that I haven't brought to the air.  Because...  I think everybody does.  Everybody does.  But you know you take shots at certain people, and then you'll make sure you don't take certain  shots at other people.  You know that.  You know that.  What shots...  Who gets treated unfairly?  By me.  Look, I don't even...  Rob Cross.  Rob Cross.  Too many Rob Cross jokes. 
[04:03:00]  Who gets treated unfairly?  You know what?  I just...  I don't even...  I don't even care anymore.  I don't even want to...  Alright.  So, you're sitting here and telling me I don't have balls.  But you'll make illusions and not actually bring up names.  Do you really want to go down this road?  You started it!  Do you really?  I mean, really, dude.  I'm just...  I'm not afraid to go down any roads.  Think.  Think.  Do you really want to go down this road?  What road?  I mean, just talking shit.  I'm so confused.  Yeah, so am I.  And so is that...  People are... 
[04:03:30]  Have to be captivated by this because they're...  This is getting awesome.  I'm getting a text message.  Yes.  I'll go down any road you want to go down.  What...  Who gets treated unfairly?  Is it you?  No, no.  Do you get...  As I said...  Do I make fun of you too much?  You take...  No, no.  You just take your little...  Your little bullshit shots and you think it's funny.  And it is funny.  Because I'll tell you this.  But then you will completely steer away from fucking with other people when there's straight  up bullshit going on.  And you know that, dude.  Because...  You fucking know that. 
[04:04:00]  When I'm in here and you're in here...  Because you don't want that fucking drama.  And I think...  And you know when you walk out of here...  What's drama?  I'm telling you.  When you and I walk out of here, we're still going to be cool after all your little bullshit  shots.  You know, after you give your little bullshit shots to Eric, you guys are still going  to be cool.  And you know that there's people that, as soon as you walk out of here, after the bullshit  goes down, you're not fucking cool anymore.  You know that.  So you avoid that fucking topic like the plague.  I'm assuming you're not talking about anybody in this room.  Right.  So you're talking about Danny again without bringing up his name.  But...  I mean, I'm not having to... 
[04:04:30]  I don't have to bring up his name.  I mean, you know who I'm talking about.  You do have to bring up his name because I don't know why you're obsessed with me not  taking shots.  He's not in here.  All I'm saying is you're taking shots at me and there are people that you don't do that  to.  Why is that?  Because they're not in here.  If you're asking me questions.  If you're fair game, but there's been shit...  Sam, there's been shit that's gone on outside of here that you've brought up with me and  with him, and you've never brought it up with other people.  I've complained about people.  Okay.  And there's shit that's gone on.  You got into fights with Danny that haven't come up on the air. 
[04:05:00]  And if he wanted to bring it up or if it came up on the air, I'd be willing to discuss  whatever you want.  It hasn't come up.  Yeah.  Danny.  Uh-oh.  He's in here.  Apparently, I've gone way too easy on you.  I'm like, I'm half hearing this in the other room, and I don't even know what's going on.  Because I haven't brought up...  Troy was upset that Sam thinks he's not the cool guy on the staff.  No, that's fine.  I don't need to be the cool guy.  So he decided to get mad at Sam for not making fun of you more often.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  That's not what it sounds like. 
[04:05:30]  Sam was taking shots at me.  Yes!  And that's fine.  And that's fine.  And there are people on this staff, i.e. Danny, that you will never take a shot at  on the air.  Even if he's in here.  You won't do it.  Do you get the vibe that I won't take shots at you?  Uh, no.  I think Sam is pretty equal with doling out shots.  He has taken shots.  I mean, I'm not going to make personal attacks against Danny and try to hurt his feelings  because the same reason I wouldn't do that to you or to Eric or to Rowan or to Travis. 
[04:06:00]  But you wouldn't take shots.  You wouldn't take shots like what you were saying before.  What was the shot at Troy that made him so angry today?  I said, Troy, I said, Eric's not the cool guy here.  And Troy said, who is the cool guy here?  Meaning nobody's cool.  And I said, I don't know.  But then I said, you're kind of like the guy who comes in.  Trying to be cool.  But then everybody says, who's this piece of shit?  You called him Fonzie.  Right.  Okay.  It's a joke.  And then he said.  In order to deflect and get it off of him somehow, it's like, oh, well, no one makes fun of Danny 
[04:06:30]  enough.  But then Sam said that you're not the cool guy.  I said, Danny's not the cool guy.  I said, Danny gets into fights with everybody.  And Danny's very negative.  But I didn't understand why I was being asked to bring up negative qualities about Danny.  You know what's funny?  You know, you said that I get into fights with everybody.  But lately, all I hear is Troy getting into fights with people on the air.  So how does that stereotype hold them?  Is that the painter guy in your shirt?  Bob Ross.  Where the fuck does Roman come up with this shit?  I don't know.  I don't know how he picks and chooses what to say and when to say it. 
[04:07:00]  It's completely arbitrary.  I think it's almost like a form of autism.  For when Troy and me have to make up, I'm going to have to get him some Argentium, which  is Steven Singer's new super silver collection.  That's right.

[04:08:00]  That's IHateStevenSinger.  Also, you could kill the bed because the after show is brought to you by Trojan Bearskin Condoms,  Trojan America's number one most trusted condom brand.  Eric, how much time does that leave me with?  You've got 30 seconds.  Let's wrap it up.  Jesus, fuck!  Because I'm running for this automated, so we can't stretch.  The computer cuts this off.  You know what?  I'd like to plug.  Wait, what?  Screw it.  Let's go.  Oh, look at the sex man.  Good for you.  Good to make an executive decision. 
[04:08:30]  Now.  I was going to plug Thanksgiving is on Thursday.  Thanksgiving is indeed on Thursday.  I am trying to figure out what the beef is here.  Yeah, I don't understand.  Basically, it boils down to there are certain people that are your go-to take shots at.  Because those are the people who end up on the air.  And Roland's on there.  You don't ever take any shots at him.  I take shots.  I don't call Roland fat.  I don't make...  You do the obvious.  And I said you...  But you don't take your negative shots, your disgusting shots. 
[04:09:00]  What have I said...  What is not the obvious that I've said about you or Eric?  Well, I'm just saying.  I'm just saying.  There's certain people that you key in and go at more.  I love your mom's cooking.  It's the same reason why there's certain people, Opie go in on more and Anthony go in on more  and Jim go in on more.  And then somebody should call them out if it comes up on the air.  But I'm going to explain to you why.  Because it's funnier.  And we're putting on an entertaining show.  Right.  And that's why I don't sit there...  And this is not entertaining?  And that's why I don't sit there and try to dig up personal history on you or Eric or 
[04:09:30]  Roland to take negative shots that hurt feelings.  I try to make jokes at their expenses.  Okay.  At your expense.  Got it.  But it's not a matter of what can I do to hurt people's feelings.  And now that I'm bringing up negative qualities about people, let me tell you what's wrong  with Danny, who's sitting in the office half listening.  Right.  Like, why...  I don't...  Yeah, there was a trigger.  Something triggered Troy.  And I don't know if that trigger was you trying to bust on him or if he has some predetermined 
[04:10:00]  problem with me that he's...  I think it was when Sam said everybody thinks Troy is just the asshole who thinks he's cool.  I said that!  Yeah, it's funny because the listeners are all like, fuck you, Troy.  And so I'm like, fuck you, Troy.  It's funny.  But my point being is I don't ever ask to come in here.  So I just...  They ask me to talk and I talk.  I'm not the one that's like, I have to...  I'm not like mad that I have to come in here and ask for airtime.  Yeah, but guess what?  Eric's not exactly starving for airtime and he gets thrown under the bus too. 
[04:10:30]  And guess what?  I don't sit there and say, hey guys, what do you think of my Googling?  Hey guys, why don't you get my mom on the phone and call her a cunt?  But it happens.  Yeah, you know what I mean?  As for...  I mean, like your situation and our situations are a little bit different.  Like we all kind of interned and got...  We worked really hard for these positions that we have because we were unpaid for a while  and we really had to work, like just work and put in the elbow grease.  And then, you know, we came here and you kind of just wanted to be a part of the crew and everything. 
[04:11:00]  And that's fine.  No one really complained about it.  But part of being that crew is taking the shit.  And, you know, you take shit here and there and everybody takes it once in a while.  Yeah, we'll take shit.  Look, so if you want to, you know, if you want to plead, you know, and please, can I be a part of that crew?  Well, congrats, you're on the crew.  So you got to take...  I'll make everything the rest of the shots that come with it.  Right, right.  And, you know, Danny, you're one that fires it back when the shots are fired at you.  You know what I mean? 
[04:11:30]  So that's all I'm doing.  That's what pisses off Troy is that I think Troy feels like Sam hits Troy intentionally  because he knows that Troy's not going to fight back.  Where he knows that if Sam starts talking shit about Danny, Danny's going to go after the fucking throat.  And rightly so, dude.  And rightly so.  I'm not saying not to.  But that's why Sam doesn't fuck with him.  Danny's not in here very much anymore.  I mean, do you want...  Okay, here's one.  Danny took a shot at me on Facebook one day because he got mad at me talking about Googling. 
[04:12:00]  It was a Friday, okay?  I was like, when I read it, somebody Twittered me, okay?  And on Saturday morning, I go, oh, okay.  I'm going to bring this up on the after show and we'll get into it.  By Monday, I was like, I forgot about it.  I don't give a fuck anymore.  But if that was anybody else, you know that that would have been on your priorities to get into.  No, it wouldn't have because I wouldn't care anymore.  If it happened on a...  Or if you had told me at 10.30, wow, look at Danny's Facebook, I'd go, why is Danny writing on Facebook about me? 
[04:12:30]  Tell him to come down here.  But by the time Monday hits, we're talking about something else.  Let's do a social experiment.  Troy, talk shit about Sam on Facebook this weekend.  See what happens.  I'm not afraid of Danny.  I'm not afraid of anyone here.  You know, physically, you all could kick my ass.  But verbally, there's no one I'm afraid of here at all.  And I've pretty much made that clear over the last six years.  Isn't that great?  That's a great way to come back to an argument, too.  When you get into a fight with somebody verbally and they go, I'm going to beat the shit out of you. 
[04:13:00]  Because that's all I've ever heard from a lot of people that I've fought with, like Steve and Mars and stuff.  Like, when you get down to that level, is it really a fight anymore?  I mean, I know that there...  I've gotten into fights with Danny on the air.  I've gotten into fights with Travis on the air.  I've gotten into fights with everybody on the air.  Now, if something doesn't come to the air naturally or just doesn't...  Like, what do you bring this up for?  Like, there's no reason for anybody's sake...  When you just go on the air and pick a fight because you go, you know what? 
[04:13:30]  I just...  Danny is bugging me because, you know, whatever.  Yeah, Danny's just sitting in the back and he's going to think, what the fuck is this asshole?  And everybody who's listening is going, okay, Sam's now just bringing up fights because he needs content for his show.  And it's bullshit fights.  I might as well be intern Matt cursing at Pat Duffy when I don't believe any of it.  But, you know, Pat Duffy almost kicked my ass.  If there was anybody that I wasn't going to fuck around with, it would be Pat Duffy.  He almost knocked you out.  I needed security that day. 
[04:14:00]  He threw things at me.  He threw a remote at your head.  Okay, I'm not afraid to talk to anyone on the air.  And of everybody here, I am 100% not afraid to say I'm the most open and honest person on the show and have the most information about me made publicly because I'm not afraid of it.  Not to say anybody else is afraid of it, but that's the way I've chosen to go about my profession.  But there's no way that you can say that I'm not – that I hold back. 
[04:14:30]  Now, I'm not going to jump on everything that Danny does because it's like – it wouldn't be productive.  It wouldn't make any sense.  And it would be like there's just no reason to do it.  But if Danny's in here and he goes, hey, Sam, do you think I'm the cool guy?  I would tell him no.  What do you mean?  Why would you say that?  Why would you give the wrong answer to all the people out there?  If Danny were sitting in here and I said Eric's not the cool guy and Danny said who is, then Danny would be in my eyesight and I would explain to him why he's not the cool guy. 
[04:15:00]  Got it.  But is there any mystery?  That's fine.  Everything's good.  I don't know.  Well, then I feel like maybe an apology is in order.  And that's something, you know, I'll borrow from Opie, but, you know, I mean, I feel like accusations remain.  And don't hold your breath.  I don't know where any of this came from.  The people in this room – you saw it.  This is crazy. 
[04:15:30]  Say it on the air.  How much we have to go, it's going to cut us off in 30 seconds.  All right.  Sam, me, Travis, even Roland, we've all been working together since, if not 04, 05.  Troy, you're the newest guy here and you seem to have, like, the most problems with the way things are.  Maybe we're all just – but, I mean, I don't have a problem.  I don't think Sam picks on anybody any more than anybody else.  I mean, aside from, like, Eric or whatever.  Okay, we're cutting off.  After the show, goodbye.  All right, bye.  Thanks again.  Opie and Anthony's show is now over. 
[04:16:00]  For real this time.  Check out the O&A show on Facebook at Facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.  And catch Opie and Anthony live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern.  The London Fairs are next.  Hey!  Bye!  Bye! </pre>
