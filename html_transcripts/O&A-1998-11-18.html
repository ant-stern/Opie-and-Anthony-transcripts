<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a contentious debate surrounding the "Tuesday Night Hummer Club," a listener-initiated segment focused on obtaining oral sex.  Opie, the self-proclaimed "Grand Poobah," faced an impeachment for failing to fulfill the club's requirement.  This led to a playful yet heated exchange with Anthony, culminating in Anthony's official ascension to the position of Grand Poobah.  The show then delved into current events, including graphic descriptions of audiotapes featuring Linda Tripp and Monica Lewinsky, commentary on Dennis Rodman and Carmen Electra's marriage, and a lengthy, comedic, and racially insensitive tribute to the late Esther Rolle and the show *Good Times*.  A call to a couple, Ed and Deanne, who had previously been encouraged to engage in sexual activity on the show, revealed their successful attempt and Deanne's initial embarrassment.

The broadcast continued with a discussion of photos from a previous segment featuring a model, followed by a listener call-in segment.  A significant portion was dedicated to a pre-recorded prank call to Jimmy "J.J." Walker's radio show in Nebraska, highlighting Walker's attempts to distance himself from his *Good Times* persona.  A mock court proceeding formally declared Anthony the new Grand Poobah of the Hummer Club, effectively ousting Opie until he successfully completed the club's requirement.  A surprise call came from Reverend Al Sharpton, who claimed to have been involved in a car accident while participating in the Hummer Club.  Throughout this section, the broadcast was punctuated by frequent vulgar language and sexually explicit content.

A later segment focused on a live phone call to Opie's girlfriend, Sandy, who demonstrated a complete lack of familiarity with the Hummer Club and the show itself, preferring pop music stations.  This resulted in significant ribbing from Anthony and Opie.  Opieâ€™s attempt to regain his Grand Poobah status depended on his participation in the club the following Tuesday, a participation his girlfriend reluctantly agreed to, albeit with reservations and conditions.  Opie concluded this segment by lamenting the loss of his "purple helmet Grand Poobah hat" and jokingly offering a "bounty" to ensure his girlfriend's cooperation and his subsequent reclaiming of the title.  The broadcast maintained its use of vulgar language and sexually explicit content throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York, Johnny Lang, his latest lie to me.  Actually, it's not his latest anymore, he's got another album out.  This guy's just knocking these albums out like crazy these days, huh?  18 years old and he's on his second CD, you ready?  What a guy.  Not too shabby, it's Hopin' Anthony, hello, hello, hello.  Hey man, what's up?  Good afternoon.  Don't look at me.  Just wondering, curious.  Don't freaking look at me. 
[00:00:30]  If you're a member, if you still deserve to be Grand Poobah of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  Well, did you get action last night?  Last night?  No, but I was inducted into the club last week.  Okay.  One week ago, there's no ruling saying you have to do it every week.  Well, I'm part of the new club.  What is it?  I didn't get Jack Wednesday.  You're the Grand Poobah. 
[00:01:00]  What did I tell you yesterday?  I don't care what you told me yesterday.  It's like Cy Sperling walking around with a bald head.  I told you yesterday that there was no way in the world I would be able to become a member last night because we were going out with the boss.  Doesn't matter.  Excuses.  What, you wanted the boss to, you know?  No, what time did we get done?  We didn't get home until, I don't know, 11.30 or so.  So?  I had a half hour to pull it off.  No, not pulling it off. 
[00:01:30]  You're supposed to get a hummer.  It didn't happen.  All right, well, you're a two-week loser.  Everyone wants to know.  No, it did not happen.  You invent the little club, and what happens?  Well, I'll take the club away if you like.  There's no taking the club away at this point.  It's got a life of its own.  Come on, I'm taking my club.  No way.  I'm going home.  Just, I mean, it would be, I think, beneficial to you, as with the grand poobah of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club, 
[00:02:00]  to maybe, oh, get a hummer.  Duh.  It's not working out, is it?  Not yet.  There's always next week.  Oh, there's always next week.  Yes, there's always next week.  And you said, if I don't get it next week, then I'm not a member?  Then we're going to start impeachment hearings, I said.  For not getting a hummer.  For not getting a hummer.  It is something a little different.  Whole thing around, yeah.  All right.  Well, we've got to congratulate all the new members of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  Very happy.  Unfortunately, I cannot join you in your celebration. 
[00:02:30]  Oh.  Oh.  What a miserable life I have.  Great.  Okay.  We've got lots to do today.  Mm-hmm.  Do we need to give out the numbers again, or what?  I don't know.  Why not?  All right.  Fax line.  212-957-WNEW.  The request line.  We'll go to that next.  212-757-1027.  Remember late in the show yesterday, we were talking to Deanne? 
[00:03:00]  Mm-hmm.  And we were talking her into giving her husband a little action last night?  Yes.  I think we've got to call her to see if the deed was completed last night.  Yeah.  She sounded like she wasn't totally committed.  Yeah.  She got us off the phone by saying, yeah, okay.  Uh-huh.  But we've got to check back now, do a follow-up.  We'll do it before the hour's up, so stick around.  The Rock of New York, 1027-WNEW.  Aerosmith coming to town, December 27th, Continental Arena.  We've got tickets all this week to give away on our show.  I don't know how we're going to blow the tickets out today. 
[00:03:30]  Do you, Anthony?  Do you have an idea of the tickets?  Anything that you want the listeners to do?  Nothing spur of the moment here.  No.  Can't think of anything right away.  Yeah.  I'm sure we will.  If you've got a good idea, you know, we've got Rick working the phone.  So listen to your wacky, zany ideas.  212-757-1027.  You know the show by now, so come up with something that we'd be interested in.  Yeah.  And you could possibly score some tickets to see Aerosmith.  Excellent.  Excellent.  All right.  Well, there it is. 
[00:04:00]  On the front page of every paper today, we all heard the audio tapes yesterday.  Mm-hmm.  Linda Tripp and Monica Lewinsky.  Linda Tripp, she's just a pig.  Look at that.  Yeah.  Look at her.  Ah, look at that.  She's on the front page for all the world to see.  Do you think anyone calls Linda Tripp at home these days?  Do you think she gets any phone calls at home?  Probably not.  Can you imagine Linda Tripp?  Hey, so how's it going?  Like I'm going to tell you?  Hold on. 
[00:04:30]  Hold on.  Let me record.  Yeah, let me start up my recording equipment.  Do you hold on?  I've got to flip the tape.  Okay.  I'll be right with you.  Ew.  Oh, no.  Ew.  Ah, guh, guh, guh, guh.  Ew.  Linda Tripp looks like the sea hag.  Ah, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh.  Let me see your face.  You want to see your face?  Give me a little inspiration.  Oh, my gosh.  Ah, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh. 
[00:05:00]  The sea hag.  Ew.  I'd rather sleeps with Brutusk.  Ew.  Ah, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh.  Well, blow me.  Down.  Ah, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh.  Shiver me member.  Yeah, there she is in all her glory.  Oh, my gosh.  What's we going to do about the sea hag?  Ah, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh.  Look at that face.  Ah, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh. 
[00:05:30]  I like the double chin.  It's cute.  Wonderful.  Oh, my gosh.  She looks like Wimpy.  Ah, guh, guh, guh, guh.  Wait, let me turn her.  Oh, wait.  Upside down she doesn't look too bad.  Oh, like that thing you used to see when you were a kid?  Yeah.  Remember that optical illusion?  One way it would look like a hot-looking chick and you turn the page upside down and it looks like Linda Tripp.  Yeah. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, that's pretty close.  So, there you go.  Everyone's talking.  Everyone's talking about that.  I'm sure we hashed that over enough yesterday, right?  Sure.  And then you got Dennis Rodman marrying Carmen Electra.  Oh, what a mess.  Two complete losers that deserve each other.  Dennis Rodman, he has one, maybe two good years left in the NBA and then he's going to be just a mess.  And Carmen Electra, she's famous for being hot.  Yeah. 
[00:06:30]  I always love the celebrities that are famous for just being hot.  For the moment.  She's like, she was hot for a moment.  And now she's married to this guy?  You think that's like a lovey-dovey, that marriage?  No, it's just a three-ring circus.  You know what I heard this morning on Regis and Kathy Lee?  Kathy Lee bashing the marriage.  Well, I don't think it'll last.  And I'm thinking to myself, you know, what a bitch.  How could she even come off after everything she says about the tabloids and everything? 
[00:07:00]  And then she admitted she doesn't know them.  She doesn't know.  But she's making an assumption, based on what she reads, that their marriage isn't going to last.  Well, how long have they been married?  Maybe they haven't been married that long, but I don't think he's screwed around on her yet.  There's one point for them that you don't have.  She's a trip.  Yeah.  She was, yeah, bashing him, saying that it probably won't last.  I agree. 
[00:07:30]  It probably won't last.  No, it's a charade.  It's stupid.  It's one of their little stunts.  It's pretty silly, yes.  And his agent is all saying that he was drunk when they got married, and it should be annulled.  I don't know.  No, but he's saying he's into it.  Okay.  So we wish him luck.  Entertainment.  It's a happy little couple.  That deserves to be on the front page of the post with everything going on in the world.  1027-WNEW, the Rock of New York, the Dave Matthews Band.  The latest from those guys that's crushed YouTube. 
[00:08:00]  Before that, it's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, anything going on in the instant email today?  No, actually, people saying thank you for the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  Does it look like we have a lot of brand new members?  Yes, it does.  People very happy with the situation there.  Okay.  And a couple of people asking why the pictures of Phyllis were taken off the web page.  She took a beating yesterday, and we promised her that we'd take the pictures off after the show.  Yeah, from time to time, we're going to be popping shots from the studio onto the web page, 
[00:08:30]  and you can go there and look at what we're doing as it happens.  And usually, we'll keep the pictures up there for a few days in case you're riding home when everything's going down  and you want to check out the pictures when you get home, but in Phyllis' case,  we promised we'd get rid of the pictures after the show.  I got the gallery girl from yesterday.  I got a few head shots of her.  Yeah, you want to pop that up today?  I'll pop one or two of those on so people can see what she looked like yesterday.  All right, go to the WNEW website, click on our pictures after you get, you know,  to the Air Staff section of our website, 
[00:09:00]  and then there'll be a live studio cam link there or something like that, right?  Yeah, something like that.  It'll be pretty obvious.  Speaking of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club, remember the couple we talked to real late in the show yesterday?  Yeah.  It was Ed and his wife, Deanne.  Mm-hmm.  We called Deanne at home, and there was a crying baby, and it just sounded not fun at all at home.  It sounded like there was no sexuality going on in that house.  And Ed begged us to call his wife to help him out a little bit  because he wanted to become a member of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club. 
[00:09:30]  Right.  Well, let's call him up and see what's going on, see if they actually became members last night.  Hello, this is Ed.  Ed, it's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Oh, just trying to work.  Well, we're all patiently waiting here.  We're wondering how you did last night.  Well, I thought you were going to ask my wife.  Well, we want to ask you first.  Oh, well, she became a member before I did.  Oh, there you go.  Now, that's nice.  All right.  Did our little talking help you guys?  Yeah, but it cost me.  What do you mean it cost you? 
[00:10:00]  Well, she got a little embarrassed, and so now I've got to buy her something from Victoria's Secret.  Oh, no.  So we can assume that you are a member.  Oh, yes.  All right.  Congratulations.  There we go.  Bravo.  Thank you, guys.  How did it all go down?  What was the move?  How did it all go down?  That's very funny.  Was it like an awkward situation when you came home, or?  No, not at all.  It just got this nice smirk on her face and a little bit of redness in her cheeks, and 
[00:10:30]  once the kids were in bed and so on, things just progressed nice and slowly from there.  Yeah.  We've just got to know, would this have happened, do you think, if it were not for the Tuesday  Night Hummer Club on the Opie and Anthony Show?  The way it happened last night, no.  There you go.  Deanne.  Yeah.  Hi.  We've got Ed on the line with us here.  Okay.  So you guys became members last night.  Oh.  He already filled you in, huh?  Yeah. 
[00:11:00]  He filled us in.  We're wondering what happened with you.  Well, hey.  I'm happy.  Oh, cool.  You're happy.  Congratulations.  I think we both had a good night's sleep last night.  You did?  Yeah.  Yeah?  So that started a little romping, did it?  Well, let's say we started before midnight and finished after.  Well, there you go.  What, 1159 and 1201?  Okay, 1202. 
[00:11:30]  All right.  Well, I'm glad we could help you guys.  Well, hey, I have to say, though, you know, you guys embarrassed me incredibly.  Oh, why?  Why?  I can't believe you're calling me to talk about this.  I know.  On the air.  Well, when it's all out in the open like this, isn't it a relief?  It's a freeing experience, isn't it?  That's what it's all about.  I don't know.  I'm thinking, like, you guys owe me.  Well, we owe you now, too.  Like, you owe me.  Well, we can figure some out.  I just think it's time to talk about sex openly again. 
[00:12:00]  Sure.  We're all a little hung up.  There's a lot of couples out there.  They don't know how to go about asking for what they want.  So you're just helping them out, huh?  That's about it.  Well, you guys became members last night.  Yeah.  And I don't think you would have had a night of action if it wasn't for us pushing you along a little bit.  Well, maybe, maybe not.  Now, today, you're humming a happy tune.  Well, after Ed vacuums and after he... 
[00:12:30]  Ben, I'll be humming a happier tune.  I'm not going to let him get off the hook.  It always comes down to that.  It was like one night of the old days, and now it's right back to where you guys were.  Hey.  Thanks, guys.  Well, congratulations, guys.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York.  Haven't heard that song in a while.  The Cult Firewoman.  Hendrix and the Wallflowers in there. 
[00:13:00]  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  A little later on, you got a chance to win tickets to see Aerosmith.  Also, don't forget, on Monday, we're going to be interviewing Kiss.  Yeah, that's cool.  We got the whole band coming in, and we're very, very excited about this.  And, of course, you know, we're always looking for your help with the radio show here.  So, if you got a question you want us to ask Kiss for you, you can fax those questions in today as well.  A lot of audience participation goes on with our show.  Yeah.  It's just going to get more so, too. 
[00:13:30]  So, 212-957-WNEW is the fax line.  You know, we get some of our best stuff from you guys, so keep it coming.  All right?  Yes.  Want to take a call here?  They're ringing off the hook.  Sure.  212-757-1027 if you got something to add.  INEW.  You guys aware of who died last night?  Who?  James.  That's the role.  She died last night?  Yeah.  You're lying.  I swear.  It was on USA Today.  I was looking on the USA Today website.  Look under the life section.  Whoa.  Wait a minute. 
[00:14:00]  Died on a Tuesday night.  Hold on.  Anthony's online right now.  Hold on a sec.  I can't believe we didn't see that.  Not Esther Roll.  Don't say Esther Roll.  Anthony saw Esther Rolls in the city about, I don't know, two months ago.  Esther Roll died.  She really died.  Yeah.  Oh, we need a little tribute.  Yeah, tribute's definitely in order.  All right, let's get a little tribute together.  Let me see.  I'm waiting for the page to come up.  It's very busy.  Probably a lot of Esther Roll fans trying to download this. 
[00:14:30]  That server's taking a lot of hits from the Esther Roll fans.  Died overnight.  No cause of death was given.  Maybe that pack of hot dogs stapled to the back of her neck had something to do with it.  They exploded.  James!  Like a ballpark Frank.  James!  I'm dead!  James!  All right, we're going to do the Esther Roll tribute.  Thank you.  Great.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Do it time.  Do it time.  Do it time. 
[00:15:00]  James!  J.J.'s been arrested.  James!  Like any hands on.  Where's Thelma?  Turning tricks.  Woo!  Make it away.  Wow, Esther Roll's dead.  temporary layoffs.  Good time!  Easy credit with us.  Sing it, baby!  Give it.  James!  I'm dead, James!  Hang it in a jar!  Woo!  Good time!  All right!  If we look and we got them. 
[00:15:30]  Oh.  Good time!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  No more good times for Esther.  Oh, yeah!  Esther's good times are behind her.  Well, she was a psychic just a little while ago.  You think she knew she was dying?  James!  I see I'm gonna die!  Where's Junior?  James!  That was...  She was always into black activism, you know.  Mm-hmm.  Promoting blacks in a good light. 
[00:16:00]  That's why I guess she played a maid on every show she was in.  What movie was she the maid in?  Driving Miss Daisy, right?  Was she?  I think she was the maid in Driving Miss Daisy.  She was a maid in, um, let's say, Maud, right?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, she was a maid in Maud.  Yeah.  Spun off to good times.  And good times.  And yeah, well, good times.  Good times!  That was...  That had to be, like, one of the most racist shows, though, ever.  It was supposed to be a good thing for blacks, that show. 
[00:16:30]  But it turned out, like, every episode, Junior, JJ, was bringing home his friend the pimp or something with the floppy hat.  Yo, JJ, I need a place to live.  Well, come over to my house.  And he'd come in and, like, start ripping off the Evans family.  Yeah.  Junior, you get him out of the house, Junior.  James, be nice.  The boy just needs a home, James.  Shut your ass, father.  With that pack of hot dogs, stay with the tobacco on that.  Big-ass rolls of fat. 
[00:17:00]  What was going on with Thelma, too?  It looked like she was turning tricks on the street.  Yeah, she was always out.  Yeah.  Never knew where she was going.  And then, uh...  And Michael?  Michael, uh, I don't know what his whole thing was.  I know he was always, uh, preaching that Jesus was black on the show.  And, uh...  Hey, Earl, you think Jesus is black?  JJ worked in a fried chicken place.  Yeah.  I mean, there were more black stereotypes on that show than anything.  Well, we got a black man in the studio. 
[00:17:30]  Earl.  James campaigned a ramp today.  James!  How you gonna feed my fat ass?  Was Good Times an accurate portrayal of, uh, the black community?  Hell no.  You sure?  Positive.  Well, if anyone thinks I'm, uh...  I'm fibbing here or anything,  let's...  Let's take a look on the, uh...  Good Times webpage  at some of the quotes from the show.  Okay.  This is from, uh, uh, J.J.'s 18th birthday show.  Michael says, 
[00:18:00]  Hey, J.J., what'd you wish for?  And he goes,  I wish I could be rich,  that I could sit back in my Cadillac and have a Big Mac.  That's some, uh, great dialogue  for advancing, uh,  black society.  On TV.  Yep.  Yeah.  That's good.  And, uh, oh, J.J. got arrested  on his, uh,  18th birthday  on that whole show.  Florida.  Let's see.  Michael shouts,  I bet you wouldn't be sticking it to him  if he was white. 
[00:18:30]  And Florida says,  Michael!  That's enough out of you!  Let your father do the talking!  And, of course,  the father says the same thing.  Ha ha ha ha!  J.J. fits the description,  a, uh,  tall, skinny, young, black man.  And he says,  You just described most of Chicago!  Don't know me!  Oh, poor, uh,  Yeah, right.  Very, very sad.  That's our little tribute.  Hey, can we play our tape  where we called, uh,  Jimmy Walker's talk show?  Oh, yeah, where is that? 
[00:19:00]  I got it somewhere.  Ha ha!  I forgot about that.  J.J. had a radio show.  Yeah.  In, where was it?  Iowa or something?  Somewhere like that.  Nebraska.  He was in Nebraska  doing a talk show.  In the middle of nowhere.  And we found out  that he hates talking about  good times and dynamite and stuff.  Yeah, he was doing, like,  a political show or something  in the middle of Nebraska.  And he just despises people  that, uh,  talk about the show.  Yeah, so we called up  and we were,  we were baiting him  with political questions.  All right, I gotta find it. 
[00:19:30]  I know I have it somewhere.  And then it always came back  to good times  and he'd get pissed off at us.  And he kept hanging up on us.  It was very funny.  All right, on the way,  uh, we got Eve Six from ACDC  and the Stone Temple College, too.  What are you guys looking at  over there?  Which one are you looking at?  Gallery.  I know.  How many,  how many issues do we got  laying around the joint now?  Too many.  I, I,  the,  the girl next door thing  that Gallery does,  we had one of the winners,  we had the winner  in yesterday.  She was a ringer, 
[00:20:00]  by the way,  because she doesn't look  like any,  any of the others.  I'm looking at,  I'm looking at linebackers.  Well,  and I'm disappointed in you  because you were the one  who turned me on a gallery.  You heard we were going to have  the gallery people in here  and you were all excited,  like,  gallery,  I love gallery.  Maybe I was thinking back  when I was 16.  Well,  at lunch today,  you didn't love gallery  too much anymore,  huh?  No,  it's,  well,  it's a whole issue  dedicated to the girl next door.  Mm-hmm.  And,  um,  you just go through  page and page  of girls that you just  don't want to see  with their clothes on.  Like their boyfriends 
[00:20:30]  take the picture  and send it into the magazine.  Oh,  my God.  That's like hubba bubba.  What do you mean hubba bubba?  When you chew a whole pack  of hubba bubba.  And?  Pull it out of your mouth.  Oh,  well,  come on,  you don't have to bait me.  I was just,  I honestly didn't know  where you were going with that.  Kind of thinking aloud.  Hubba bubba.  Sorry.  All right.  Does the boss like  the gallery magazines?  Oh,  yeah,  I'm sure he does.  Not really.  No.  No.  After studying it, 
[00:21:00]  no.  One of them does look like  Imus stuff.  Hey,  it is Imus.  Yeah,  I'll shave down  Imus in the morning.  Yeah.  All right.  Oof.  Oh,  my God.  What's wrong with this one?  I've never seen  so many stretch marks  and so many  C-section scars  and so many  poorly groomed  groin areas.  They're all from Portland.  Yeah.  Photographed by her friend,  David.  Yeah,  Bigfoot.  Yeah, 
[00:21:30]  it looks like  the Bigfoot footage.  All right,  we got to move on  with some rock here,  huh?  1027 WNEW,  the rock of New York,  Stone Temple Pilots  doing Dancing Days  off Encomium,  a tribute to Led Zeppelin,  which is a pretty good city,  a bunch of bands  that,  you know,  did some of the  Zeppelin songs,  and I'm looking at this  and Hootie and the Blowfish  doing Hey,  Hey,  What Can I Do?  Yee.  Ooh.  That's sacrilege. 
[00:22:00]  When it came out,  they had a career.  Way to wreck a CD.  You know when you get  these compilation CDs  and then there's that  one track  that just blows it.  You can't get to the stereo  fast enough  to get past it.  Yeah.  Like,  ugh.  Well,  that's it.  That is it.  Well,  we're kind of sad today.  Yes.  Suffering a loss  in the entertainment community.  Our listeners had to tell us  we weren't even prepared  for this today.  Esther Roll,  Florida,  from Good Times. 
[00:22:30]  Dead.  Dead.  She died overnight.  James!  So we're kind of reflecting  on Good Times  and Esther Rolls.  And the trifecta's done.  Celebrities die in threes.  I believe that's it.  Red Holzman.  Mm-hmm.  What's his name  from the Jets?  Wee Bubank.  Thank you.  God,  91 years old.  That's a good contract.  Yeah,  not bad.  And then Esther Rolls,  so.  James!  Dunsky.  But I found the  Jimmy Walker tape,  Anthony.  Ah,  yes,  we called Jimmy Walker  at his radio show. 
[00:23:00]  This goes back  a couple years ago  because he's no longer  doing talk radio.  It's obvious why  he's not doing  talk radio anymore.  He was in Nebraska  or somewhere  doing talk radio  trying desperately  to get rid of  the J.J. image,  the dynamite thing.  He got rid of  that wacky hat,  shaved his head,  and was starting  to do talk radio.  And he wanted to  address serious issues  on this show.  And if you ever  want to just tick him off  if you see him  walking around  the streets of New York,  just ask him to do dynamite. 
[00:23:30]  He'll go punch you  in the face.  Say,  hey, J.J.,  dynamite!  He hates it.  He doesn't want to  even acknowledge  that he used to say that.  Exactly.  He doesn't even want  to acknowledge good times.  So, having that knowledge,  Anthony and I  decided to spend  a whole afternoon  calling his talk show.  Yeah.  We were harassing him.  We were harassing him.  And I got a couple  of the calls  where, you know,  we act like we're serious,  you know,  callers to his little radio show  and then the tides  changed at the end  and he's hanging up  on us and stuff. 
[00:24:00]  He was outrageous  because he was like  a right-wing radio host  a la Rush Limbaugh.  Yes.  But he was a black guy.  Oh, he was just outrageous.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, listen to this.  Check this out.  Jimmy J.J. Walker  on Husker Radio 1290 K Car.  Now, hear his brand  of unconventional talk radio.  You can call Jimmy now  at 342-1290,  1-800-577-1290  or pound 1290  on your Alliance cellular phone. 
[00:24:30]  Now, Jimmy Walker.  I like to move it, move it.  I like to move it, move it.  I like to move it, move it.  I like to move it, move it.  Jimmy J.J. Walker  and Omi Ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Husker Radio 1290 K Car.  Talking about it all.  And we got people  that want to talk to me  and they want to talk to you.  They got the hour.  They want the power.  You know I give it to them.  Gotta rhyme.  You're on with Jimmy J.J. Walker.  How you doing, Tony?  Jimmy.  How are you, sir?  Hey, it's great to hear 
[00:25:00]  the show finally a voice  of reason that we could  listen to on the radio.  Well, I think I'm reasonable.  That's all.  I just consider myself  a logical right person.  Yeah, that's great  because I want to talk to you  about the political correctness  going on in Washington.  That's what I think  about all this gun control  that's going on there.  They're going after  the innocent people.  Well, the innocent people  are the people that  have applied for guns legally.  Absolutely.  Not the whole deal.  Like I said earlier,  the horse is out of the barn.  You know, I'm of a belief 
[00:25:30]  that I think we should  abolish that, Brady  and all that other stuff  because those who have guns  are going to have them  in terms of the illegal people.  Those of us, you know,  who apply normally,  I mean, we don't want  to commit crimes.  We want to follow the law,  but it seems like  they don't want us to do that.  That's exactly what I'm getting.  You ever see us  to roll naked?  Thank you.  Hey, how's Rerun doing?  Good advice from J.J. 
[00:26:00]  We're going to...  You hear him, though?  Yeah.  He's all like,  I'm not J.J. anymore.  I am James Walker.  James Walker.  And I'm doing a talk show.  And Rerun?  What was that about?  Yeah, it's not even  the same show.  How's Rerun doing?  Yeah, what do I know?  But we did this  all afternoon long.  K-Car, Jimmy Walker,  show your first day.  Uh, Greg.  Where are you calling from, Greg?  Uh, Nebraska.  Omaha?  Yep.  Okay, how old are you, Greg?  I'm 48.  We're just doing  some demographic research.  We'll get you  as soon as we can, okay? 
[00:26:30]  Uh-huh.  42 degrees,  Norm Roberts,  News Radio, 1290 K-Car.  The views expressed  on this program  are not necessarily  those of 1290 K-Car  or its advertisers.  Y'all ready for this?  Now, more Jimmy Walker  on Husker Radio,  1290 K-Car.  Call Jimmy now  at 342-1290.  Call free  at 1-800-577-1290  or on your  Alliance cellular phone  pound 1290.  Now, Jimmy Walker. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, Jimmy J.J. Walker,  big car, man.  Hustle Radio, 1290  in Omaha.  Give me that hour,  I will give you the hour.  Talking about gangs  and the eradication of them  and I don't know  why we are so delicate  and gentle with these people.  It's not necessary.  God,  just like termites  or roaches,  they should be eradicated  and we seem to really  be concerned  about rehabilitating roaches.  I mean,  imagine that,  you know,  getting roaches  to be better roaches.  There's roaches in Thelma's room.  Wouldn't that be nice  to have a good train 
[00:27:30]  roach around the house?  I'd use one, man.  You're on with Jimmy J.J. Walker.  How you doing?  Hi.  Hi, J.J.  How you doing, buddy?  Hi.  Hey, first time caller.  I love your show, though.  Go ahead.  I want to know,  you're talking about gangs and all?  We got it right here.  Yeah,  if J.J. was in a gang,  you think it would be  a blood or a crip?  Oh,  I don't think so.  None of those things.  No?  Come on.  I want to ask a follow-up question. 
[00:28:00]  They didn't let me  ask my follow-up.  No.  Oh,  James!  He was so ticked off at us.  Jimmy Walker  doing a right-wing  political show  in Nebraska.  And it was so easy  to get through  to his show as well.  Oh, yeah.  All right,  on the way,  we got the latest  from Metallica  doing Turn the Page  and Keep the Faxes  are coming.  212-957  WNEW.  I want to say hi  to Dory and Teresa.  Got your facts here.  We're asking all the listeners  to send in their  Kiss questions  because we're interviewing  the band Monday. 
[00:28:30]  Will you guys ever release  another set of solo albums?  What are our chances  of getting backstage passes?  And why does Paul  wear the star?  Do you know  the answer to that?  No.  We'll have to ask him  that question  at least on Monday,  all right?  If you've got a question  you want us to ask Kiss,  keep the Faxes coming.  No Rock of New York,  1027-WNEW.  The latest  from Metallica.  Turn the page.  Those guys doing  an in-store  next Tuesday. 
[00:29:00]  Very happy birthday  going out to Kurt Hammett.  How old is Kurt today?  36.  Happy birthday.  Very good.  God, man.  Huh.  Wasn't it  his birthday last year  that we were  at the concert?  where they came out  and like railed him  with a silly string  and pies.  Silly string and stuff.  Yeah,  threw cake in his face  and stuff.  A year ago already?  Yep.  Wow.  Pretty much.  Why?  Time flies, huh?  Not too much went on  in the past year for us.  Yeah,  nothing at all. 
[00:29:30]  But the in-store  is happening next Tuesday  4 to 6 at Virgin Megastore,  okay?  Cool.  All right.  We got a bunch of requests  for the Klee Motors thing.  Klee Motors?  I'm stalling  because someone said,  could you please play it?  I want to get it on tape  to play for all my friends.  Oh,  so you're catering  to one person right now.  Yeah,  so we're stopping  our radio show  so that guy  can fumble with tapes  right now.  Tell us when you're ready.  Great.  Tell us when you're ready.  That's okay.  No one's listening.  There's really no one else listening. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah,  great.  All right,  I'm getting the word  that the guy's ready for this.  Well,  I hope you spread  the word of the show as well.  If you're spreading  the bits around,  that's cool,  but tell people  where they're coming from  because I still get emails  and faxes from people  saying that Adam Sandler  wrote the  Hey Masturbator song.  Oh,  stop.  No,  he did not.  I hate that.  We'll have to get into that.  Maybe we'll get into that  later on.  Yeah.  In the 5 o'clock hour  because there's a song  off our Dementor World CD.  It's copywritten.  Anthony wrote it. 
[00:30:30]  Anthony sung it.  It's on our CD.  And we have to face  these emails all the time  that say,  hey,  check out this wacky,  goofy new song  that Adam Sandler did  called The Hey Masturbator  done to Hey Macarena.  Well,  he needs the help.  Yeah.  Right now.  His career is slumping.  He's not doing very well.  Yeah.  He's probably not making  that much money.  Waterboy is going to make  $100 million in,  what,  three weeks?  Sign of the pending apocalypse.  And our CD sells  five units every week  in New York City. 
[00:31:00]  All right.  I got something for you guys  for sticking through  the commercials  because only the faithful  listeners do that for us  day in and day out.  Right,  Anthony?  We got a pair of tickets  to see Aerosmith.  When you hear  The Who,  Eminence Front,  be the 10th caller  at 212-757-1027  and you'll score the tickets.  Not going to mention this again,  so just pay attention  for The Who,  all right?  1027 WNEW,  The Rock of New York,  Live Rush,  the spirit of radio.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  We got to say hi  to all the brand new members 
[00:31:30]  of the Tuesday Night  Hummer Club.  They're all checking in  like crazy  through the fax machine  and the phones  and the instant feedback.  Yeah.  I think everyone has  Hummer hangovers today.  Let me read  because that's all  they want to talk about.  Hey, guys,  I'm really disappointed  to find out that  not only is our president  of the Hummer Club  not a participating member,  but also a wussy  for not getting one  last night.  Did we have to go  little betty-bye  at 1130?  Very, very disappointed  Jimmy in Brooklyn.  Opie, uh... 
[00:32:00]  Wait a minute.  Why is that...  The grand poobah  of the Hummer Club  and he hasn't even  gotten his Tuesday Hummer.  Anthony,  who invented  the Tuesday Night  Hummer Club?  Opie did.  You did.  So, why is everyone  disappointed in me?  I'm bringing happiness  to everyone.  Doesn't matter.  You have to, uh,  join the club.  All right.  You're a false, uh, god.  I would like to join the club.  You're, uh, you know,  you're put up there  as this guy that starts  this great organization,  and it turns out  you're a, you're a fraud. 
[00:32:30]  Let's look back.  You know what happened  20 years ago today?  Uh...  20 years ago?  Uh, I'm in the hot seat today.  The Jim Jones Massacre.  Yeah?  In Guyana.  900 people died  because of a cult  started by this guy  and he was a phony.  Now, do you want  this to happen?  No, not at all.  I don't know if I could, uh,  make that tie-in,  but I think you're  like Jim Jones.  You were trying, though.  You were trying there.  You know.  I didn't know what  you were getting at,  but you were trying.  Yeah, I was. 
[00:33:00]  You know how many people  emailed us and said  that, uh,  they joined the club  on their way home  from work last night?  In the car.  In the car.  And a bunch of listeners  called saying that  they were seeing this stuff  going on on the highways  and byways.  You gotta watch that.  Because, you know,  when you're in traffic,  like, uh, you know,  bumper-to-bumper traffic  and stuff,  you see the same cars  over and over again.  You see the people.  Well, this one guy  was telling me  he saw two people  and then, you know,  half a mile up,  uh, he's only seeing  one person. 
[00:33:30]  That's what happened to me!  That's what happened  to Reverend Al!  What's up, Reverend?  I was participating  in the Tuesday Enon  Hummer Club!  Came around the corner.  Yeah.  Wham!  Bagel!  Yeah, you're on.  Big Mac flew out my mouth.  Now, you're in the hospital.  Yeah.  Well, you were.  You're obviously  in the studio.  Hallelujah.  And you were in a little  fender bender yesterday.  A little conclusion  of the brain.  And that's the reason  why you guys were  in the fender bender, huh?  Yeah!  I was, uh, 
[00:34:00]  getting a Hummer  in the car  when it tied  into another car.  Who was the lucky guy?  That ain't very funny.  But I am suing  the airbag company.  Why?  For assaulting me.  It popped down  and hit me  because I am a black man.  Have you ever  seen those airbags?  Yeah.  Big white things.  Yes.  Come on,  smack a black man  in the face.  In the newspaper,  I'm suing them too.  You're suing everyone, huh?  Said I'm suffering  from a swollen leg.  How do they know? 
[00:34:30]  Said I was no swollen leg.  That's the size  of my leg.  Big fat leg.  And I want to thank  Jerry Curl  for saving me.  Saving my life.  Yeah?  What did that...  My head slipped  right off the windshield  with my hair processing.  Hallelujah!  Praise God!  I think that big old  medallion saved your life.  Yeah, the medallion  helped me out.  See, that would have  hurt hitting the dance floor. 
[00:35:00]  But the medallion  kind of broke,  broke the energy  that my head  would have absorbed.  I see.  On the dance floor.  And you're an official  member of the  Tuesday Night Hummer Club,  huh, Reverend Al?  I was trying.  Okay.  But thank God  she lifted her head up  before impact  or Reverend Al  would have lost  his little pal.  You know what I'm saying?  You know what you're saying.  Hallelujah!  Praise God!  I'm having a  fundraiser for me.  Yeah?  Yeah, I'm fine,  but I want a fundraiser  at the Apollo Theater. 
[00:35:30]  Hey, I'm there in Harlem.  Come down,  help out Reverend Al.  Give me a dollar  or you'll hear me holler.  Okay, Reverend Al,  everyone.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Okay.  I have been vindicated.  Yes, yes.  I have a conclusion  of the brain.  All right, he's leaving.  Hallelujah!  The good Reverend  has left the studio.  So he's a member  of the Tuesday Night  Hummer Club.  Yeah, even Reverend Al.  Now, once again,  I've got to explain my case  because people are  getting on my case.  Um, we were out  with the boss last night.  Yeah. 
[00:36:00]  And I wasn't going  to ask the boss  for a, you know,  a humski.  No.  Hi, NAW.  Hey, what's up?  What's up?  Nothing.  I just talked to someone.  I explained to them.  I kind of christened  these guys the Grand Poobahs  of the Hummer Club  last week.  Yes, you did.  And I'm a lawyer  in New Jersey.  And these guys  are in big trouble.  I'm going to sue Opie  for misrepresentation,  fraud, and deceit  until he becomes a member.  Oh, yeah.  Well, give me a time period.  Your time,  you should have been  the first one 
[00:36:30]  to step up.  Step up.  It's true.  What happened to, uh, me?  What happened to Rick?  Uh, we, uh,  Rick got one.  I'm ashamed.  I went home.  Jennifer had a lovely, uh,  dinner, candlelights,  followed by a dessert  of a Hummer.  Great.  Keep it to yourself.  And Opie comes in Wednesday.  He couldn't get one.  So we're like,  all right, well,  we'll give him next week.  Which was yesterday.  You gotta...  Opie, you don't understand  what the rest of us had to do. 
[00:37:00]  I had to promise  to paint the damn living room.  Oh, my...  See, I think...  You don't even have the guts  to demand one  to become  the official Grand Poobah.  See, that's the problem.  I don't think I'm ready  to give in anything  to get my Hummer.  Oh, come on.  Well, we're hearing  from a lot of guys  that they had to sacrifice  a lot to get  into the club last night.  You're backpedaling.  Oh, yeah.  You are officially  Poobah elect  until you do this.  You're not even Poobah.  I am taking over.  It's a coup  happening right now.  I am assuming 
[00:37:30]  control and command  of the Tuesday Night  Hummer Club.  Damn right.  Wait, wait.  I'm taking my club  and I'm going home now.  You can't.  I have just assumed power.  I have the army of people  that want Hummers  and have gotten Hummers.  No way, pal.  Get away from me.  I'm the head  of the Hummer Club.  No, I am.  Until you get a Hummer  take your hand.  Sit your non-Hummer ass down.  There's a legal principle  called dissociation  and you have been  disassociated  with this club.  Not without a...  You have been  thrown out. 
[00:38:00]  Not without a trial.  Until you get your Hummer.  There's no trial.  This is a coup.  Innocent until proven guilty.  Coup d'etat.  Come on.  You're out.  Come on.  You've been ousted.  Somebody help me out  out there.  I'm not going to help you out.  You're a hypocrite.  I'm not a hypocrite.  I created the club.  I need a little slack here.  Doesn't matter.  Come on.  Doesn't matter.  You're out.  I have assumed control.  My girlfriend's jaw  is wired shut.  Give me another week.  Come on.  Rick, you're the  Secretary of Defense.  Hit Opie.  I will not stand  for this, you ass. 
[00:38:30]  You're out.  You're ousted.  As legal counsel  of the Hummer Club,  I only represent Anthony.  That's right.  He's my attorney.  Now I'm not even talking to you.  Opie, talk to my attorney.  Take care, guys.  You guys are great.  Official attorney  of the Hummer Club.  You're out.  Bye-bye.  We love you.  Bye.  Well, there you go.  Well, you've heard  from my lawyer.  Someone help me out.  I invented this club.  You're out.  It doesn't matter.  I'm in hell.  It doesn't matter  what you invented.  Yeah, it does.  Done. 
[00:39:00]  You're out.  Ousted.  Hi, NAW.  Yeah, I want to defend Opie  and his little problem  with the Hummer Club.  All right.  Turn your radio down first.  We're on like a 10-minute delay.  Turn your radio down.  10-minute.  All right.  I got it.  All right.  Go.  All right.  How could you defend Opie  who's allegedly supposed  to be the head of this club  and he hasn't even gotten  a Hummer?  I just wanted to tell him  that he shouldn't feel bad  because I've been begging  for one for the last two weeks  and I haven't gotten one either.  Well, then you're not  in the club.  I'm sorry.  I wish you were.  I wish every guy was, 
[00:39:30]  but officially you're not in, right?  Right.  Well, Opie hasn't,  so he's not in.  All right.  I understand I'm not  an official member  of the club I invented,  but you can't, like,  take my grand poobah stats away.  You're gone as poobah.  Your poobah-dom  can be reinstated  after you get your Hummer.  Part of the,  look at the bylaws.  Let's look.  Paragraph 8,  section 325.  The poobah must indeed  be a member  of the Hummer Club. 
[00:40:00]  Now, I am assuming  all responsibilities  as grand poobah.  Can we take up  a collection for a hooker?  I don't care  how you go about it,  but as respect  to all the other people  that are members, Opie,  I cannot let somebody  who is not a member  be the head  of this organization.  All right,  N.E.W.  Hey, I want to talk  to Opie and Anthony.  Right here.  Turn down your radio.  All right.  Go.  All right, yeah,  I just want to let you know  that my wife  made a suggestion 
[00:40:30]  about,  instead of the Tuesday night,  she said,  the Monday Night  Muff Divers Club.  What do you think about it?  Well, we'll work on that  one problem at a time.  I think we'll let  that fly through.  Well, I'll tell you, Opie.  All right, well.  You've been overthrown.  You're out until...  Fine, I'm taking my club  and I'm going home.  You can't.  I'm taking all my playboys  that I hid under  the shag carpet  up in the tree for.  Yes, I'm taking it all home.  Have fun with your little club.  That's it.  You're out.  Bye-bye. 
[00:41:00]  Well, I do have a song  for everyone  that's not an official member  of the Tuesday night  Hummer Club, Anthony.  Club of the people, Opie.  Well, there's a lot of guys  still out there  not, you know, members.  And ladies,  because the ladies  become members as well.  That's Opie's song. 
[00:41:30]  He's not a member.  Well, that's off our CD,  Opie and Anthony's  Demanded World.  For some reason,  it's going around the Internet  that Adam Sandler  wrote that song  and they have all the lyrics  and they send it all around  to everyone's email.  But Adam Sandler  really needs the help.  But that song is copywritten  and it's on our CD  and no one cares  and screw everyone.  Hey, Opie,  why don't you just join  the He-Man Women Haters Club?  Hey, Spain.  I'll get there.  So what's the official rule here?  The official rule is  you cannot be the poobah 
[00:42:00]  of this organization  until you indeed  receive your Tuesday Night Hummer.  Fine.  Am I allowed to mention the club?  Of course.  Am I allowed to help  the other poor saps out there  and call their wives still?  You would be  a better man for it, Opie.  Yes, you can indeed do that,  but you are not considered  the Grand Poobah.  You're going to take  this Grand Poobah hat off me?  I have to.  I have to.  I don't want to do this.  It's for the people, Opie. 
[00:42:30]  Hello?  Hello?  Opie, Anthony.  Hey.  Listen, Opie,  you got to be impeached.  Simple and plain.  Exactly.  You can't even be called  Grand Poobah.  You haven't even gotten  a Hummer.  All right.  Did you get your lovely Hummer?  I was the first one.  I'm the president.  Oh, Fred.  Yes.  Fred is the president.  He's the president.  Yes, I'm the president.  Fred, but don't you understand  if it wasn't for me  coming up with a stupid idea  in my stupid apartment.  Doesn't matter.  Doesn't matter.  No, I will.  I will uphold the office. 
[00:43:00]  Okay.  Thank you.  You look completely ridiculous  in that hat.  Next.  Next.  Why is everyone in line  kissing your ring now?  Because I am indeed  the Grand Poobah  of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  But the line...  People understand,  respect my position,  respect that I know  what it's like  to be in the trenches.  Mm-hmm.  But the line goes  all the way down the hall.  They want to see  the Grand Poobah.  Come in next.  Oh, the official court papers  are already in.  In my hand,  faxed and signed.  I have lawyers on my side  working for me.  The Honorable Candy Apples 
[00:43:30]  residing on the bench.  We'll read the court papers  next that gives Anthony  the Grand Poobah hat.  Power.  I love the feeling  of power here.  Of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club  as people continue  to come into the studio  and kiss the ring.  Thank you.  Thank you.  The Rock of New York,  1027 WNEW.  Hello?  Hi.  I'm looking for a Hummer.  Who?  I need a Hummer.  Hummer?  Yeah.  What's a Hummer? 
[00:44:00]  Uh, you know, um...  Blah, blah, blah.  No, I think you've got  the wrong number.  How much for a Hummer?  What's a Hummer?  Hummer is, you know...  Blah, blah.  No, no, no.  I think you've got  the wrong number.  Okay, bye-bye.  Ugh.  This is going to be impossible.  Got more numbers.  What do you mean numbers?  Well, for the, um...  Japanese massage parlors.  Oh, you do?  Thanks.  Well, I'm trying.  I'm trying anything  to get my Grand Poobah hat back. 
[00:44:30]  She didn't know  what a Hummer was.  No.  She knew Yankee Cranky.  Oh, well.  Well, the court papers  are here, Anthony.  Congratulations.  You are the, uh...  the new Grand Poobah...  Of course I am.  ...of the, uh...  Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  Only way it should have happened.  We got, uh...  court papers from, uh...  the Superior Court  of New Jersey.  Uh...  Docket number 69,  Civil Action Order.  Anthony,  a.k.a.  Grand Poobah,  and all Hummer Club members  are the plaintiffs  versus Opie,  a.k.a.  ex-Grand Poobah,  the defendant. 
[00:45:00]  This order sets forth  the decision of the court  of November 17, 1998,  pursuant to the notice of motion  filed by Paul in New Jersey,  attorney for plaintiffs.  The court,  by the Honorable Candy Apples,  consider the motion  with oral argument  on November 17, 1998.  The decision of the court  is as follows.  It is on this 17th day  of November 1998,  ordered,  defendant Opie  is disassociated  from the Hummer Club  until such a time  as he re-assumes  his leadership role  as a member.  Isn't it the 18th today? 
[00:45:30]  Oh!  Oh!  A little glitch  in the paperwork.  Oh, we're going back...  You can't capitalize on that.  We're going back to court.  And two,  Anthony will be known  as the only Grand Poobah  of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club  until such a time  as Opie becomes a member  and provides full details  to all other rightful members  of the club.  And finally,  the Hummer hat  will be sent to  Hummer Club Legal Council  for safekeeping  until such a time  that Opie becomes a member  if ever.  I'm not buying that.  I wear the hat.  Honorable Candy Apples. 
[00:46:00]  Throw it at me.  Jackass.  All right,  on the way,  we got delays  from Johnny Lang  and some Van Halen 2.  Oh, whoa,  we don't have spots.  What line can I go to?  2.  Great.  Professional radio  at its best.  Hi, N.E.W.  This is Opie?  Yeah, what's up?  I got a solution for you.  Oh, what's the solution?  Anthony's mom's busy tonight.  Oh, yeah.  Remember that girl  you used to go out with?  Get that little line to her 
[00:46:30]  when you go over  to her house for dinner  or something.  I'm sure she'll just love that.  All right,  I take that back.  That's right.  She's a good cook.  The solution is,  that girl you used to go out  with,  they look like  George Animal Steel.  The one with the hair  down at that.  I hung up on him,  Anthony.  1027 WNEW,  the rock of New York.  Van Halen jump.  Latest from Johnny Lang  before that.  Still raining.  And it's Opie and Anthony.  And I'm just in a horrible mood now.  Well, you've lost your...  We have a whole new audience, 
[00:47:00]  so why don't you quickly  explain what happened, Anthony.  Opie, the inventor  of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club,  which has made a lot of guys happy  over the past couple of weeks,  getting hummers  from their girls  on Tuesday nights.  I challenged him  today  on his Grand Poobah status  because he is indeed  not a member  of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club,  and I don't see how  a non-member  can run the organization.  Me being a member,  I felt I was more suited  to be the head, 
[00:47:30]  the Grand Poobah,  wear the  illustrious Grand Poobah hat.  It looked...  The hat looks ridiculous on you.  At least it's  legitimate.  It's justified  being on my head.  It's ridiculous.  You've got the strap  around your chin.  I'm wearing it proudly.  Four feet high.  It looked better on me.  I'm wearing it proudly.  It belonged on me.  You, I had to wrestle away  the Grand Poobah  that I'm from  because you're not a member,  and I don't think  it's out of respect  for other members, 
[00:48:00]  you can't be the Poobah.  And my statement  to all our listeners,  I hate you all.  I'm sorry you feel that way.  Well, because we left it up  to the listeners in the end,  and I was looking  really good there.  You had four to one.  And all I needed  was one lousy vote,  and you came out of nowhere  to take the crown.  Well, people with sense  started calling.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hey.  Hi.  What's up?  Not much.  Who's this now?  Opie.  Hey.  Hi.  I have a question. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  Did I ask you already?  I asked somebody.  Am I still a member  of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club  if I did it  with somebody else's boyfriend?  Of course you are.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Do I get bonus points for that?  That's probably bonus points.  I don't know what you get,  but, yeah,  there's no rules  who it has to be.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  That's fun.  All right.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  Bye.  Now, Opie,  there's only one person  really responsible 
[00:49:00]  for keeping you  from being Poobah.  Mm-hmm.  One person holding you back,  let's say.  Yeah.  And that is your girlfriend.  Right.  Of course.  Sandy.  Yes.  And I know that we call  people's girlfriends  on Tuesday.  Mm-hmm.  Explain to them  what the Tuesday Night  Hummer Club is about,  and it's usually successful.  Yes.  So I'm thinking maybe  the same will work for you.  Good luck.  Well, like I said earlier,  that, you know,  if there's a shuttle mission  happening soon, 
[00:49:30]  because that's what  my schedule's all about  when it comes to Hummers.  Well, Opie,  as Poobah,  I want to help you out.  Okay.  I am the new Poobah.  I am going right to the...  What are you laughing at?  I'm laughing.  What is Earl laughing at?  I'm laughing at him.  At least I get laid.  Like President Ford  pardoned Nixon  after he got in there,  after Nixon got thrown out.  I am going to help you.  All right.  So what do you want me to do?  I want you to hit line three  and talk to Sandy.  My girlfriend.  Great.  Sweetie.  Hi. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, did you hear what happened?  No, what?  I'm not the grand Poobah  of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club anymore.  Anthony overthrew me  live on the air.  What are you talking about?  I overthrew his authority  as grand Poobah  of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club  and I took his grand Poobah hat away  because...  Do you have a grand Poobah hat?  Yeah.  Where'd you get that?  Because he is not a member  and he will not regain  his grand Poobah status  until he is a member.  And you're a member?  Yeah, I'm a member.  Oh, of course. 
[00:50:30]  I don't know.  Hope's in a little bit  of trouble here.  What does he need  to be a grand Poobah again?  Well, next Tuesday,  you know...  Has to be Tuesday?  Yeah.  That's why it's  the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  Haven't you been paying attention?  No, I haven't.  Oh, my God.  Your own girl is...  Do you even listen  to our radio show?  Who do you listen to?  Rocky?  No.  I listen to Z100.  Or 1035.  I like the house music. 
[00:51:00]  You ass.  That's brutal.  This is pathetic.  Not only am I not  the grand Poobah  of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club,  my girlfriend doesn't  even listen to our radio show.  Great.  Great, sweets.  Thanks.  What can I say?  They pinned me down  and they took the hat  off my head.  And Anthony is proudly  wearing it over there.  because you  didn't come to the plate.  Well, then next Tuesday, right?  Boy, can't wait. 
[00:51:30]  I'll mock it on the calendar.  I'll try to be home.  Yeah, do you have another date?  I'm pathetic.  So, is that a verbal agreement?  Um, yeah.  Why'd you have to think about it?  You know, it's private stuff.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's real private.  The whole freaking city  knows I'm not getting homeless.  He was very disappointed  at not being grand Poobah anymore.  Uh, well,  next Tuesday,  then he can have his title back.  All right.  We're going to have to get  your confirmation, though, 
[00:52:00]  that it happened.  I'm not going to take  his word for it.  Oh, my God.  On the radio?  Yeah, on the radio.  I'm not going to take  Opie's word for it.  He wants this hat back bad.  Oh, all right.  You can count on it.  Well, all right.  Can't wait.  And maybe some snapshots.  I don't think so.  All right, sweets.  Yeah, let me write that down now.  Oh, that's romantic.  I don't have anything else  going on Tuesday.  I'll pencil that in.  Okay.  Speaking of penciling.  Yeah, I'll pencil it  just in case something comes up  and I'll have to change it. 
[00:52:30]  Oh.  No, this is great.  I love this.  This is a lot of fun.  Now you know why  I invented the club.  All right, sweetie.  Okay.  Can't wait to see you.  All right.  I'll see you Tuesday.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  No, that was fun, man.  Thanks.  Well, I'm trying to help  as Grand Poova.  Yeah, I appreciate it.  Tuesday.  Wow, that's going to be  real romantic. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, real romantic.  Shut up.  I'm pathetic.  Wow, man.  Look at me.  I don't have my hat anymore.  She's not even listening to you.  She doesn't listen to my show.  Oh.  All right, great.  I had something to say here, but...  You got nothing to say.  God damn.  Yeah.  It looks grim now, Opie, but...  I want to start a new club.  What's your new club? 
[00:53:30]  I didn't get Jack Wednesday.  Just got this fax in.  Linda Tripp looks exactly like  one of the Angry Beavers  from the Nickelodeon cartoon.  Oh, that's good.  That's good, Maria.  Very good.  I still think she looks  like the sea hag.  Well, blow me down.  Here's Zeppelin on  The Rock of New York,  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW, 
[00:54:00]  The Rock of New York.  The ladies from the Black Crows  kicking my heart around  from By Your Side,  which will be out  second week in January.  It's Opie and Anthony  just about out the door.  Going to congratulate  Anthony for overthrowing  me today.  Yep.  To become the Grand Poobah  of the Tuesday Night  Hummer Club.  Got close in the voting.  The purple helmet  Grand Poobah hat  looks ridiculous on you.  And I will get it back.  Well, I think  I wear it well.  I think I make  a better Poobah. 
[00:54:30]  But everyone knows that.  Great.  That's how the vote went.  But as long as I get  my Hummer next Tuesday, right?  I get Grand Poobah  status back, right?  Yeah, but it sounds like  I'll be wearing this hat  for a while.  I'm putting a bounty out.  A bounty?  Bounty, yes.  To find ladies of  the New York area.  A bounty?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You know how you put  bounties out on criminals  and stuff?  Yeah.  A bounty.  Hey, Rick,  what kind of tickets  we got? 
[00:55:00]  We got good tickets, right?  Aerosmith and stuff?  For what?  I got to get my hat back.  Oh, Mikey,  that's prostitution.  Screw everything.  I don't care.  You can't do that.  The bounty has been set  for next Tuesday.  Another price on a head.  It's like the old  bounty hunters used to do.  Well, that's how it used to be.  Hey, I got to do  what I got to do  to get my hat back.  That's all I know.  Whatever you got to do.  I got to get my hat back. </pre>
