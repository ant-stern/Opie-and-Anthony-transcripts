<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a profane, Shatner-esque intro before launching into a self-deprecating discussion of their own show, which they jokingly referred to as a "shit show," based on their post-broadcast listening experience.  A significant portion of the early show focused on listener feedback, specifically harsh criticisms of co-host Sam's work ethic and prolific radio appearances. This segued into a segment dedicated to "Aging Agent Smith," a listener who created profane and conspiracy-laden YouTube videos attacking the show, particularly their handling of the Jesse Ventura/Chris Kyle controversy.  The hosts played excerpts, highlighting the listener's thick, hard-to-place accent (later identified as likely from Newfoundland) and his 9/11 conspiracy theories.  Their response was equally profane and mocking.

The show then hosted an in-studio interview with Michael Clarke Duncan, who discussed his career, including anecdotes about his time as a bodyguard (giving Queen Latifah piggyback rides), fabricating acting experience for his resume, and experiences on sets like *Armageddon*, *The Green Mile*, and his then-current show, *The Finder*.  His girlfriend, Omarosa Manigault-Stallworth, joined the interview, and the hosts engaged in playful teasing of the couple. The interview was interspersed with continued mockery of "Aging Agent Smith," with running jokes about his appearance and theories.  Duncan also recounted meeting Keith Sutherland.

The conversation shifted to a *Hoarders* episode featuring Sherry and her family's shockingly unsanitary living conditions. The hosts and callers, including Greg, reacted with disgust and outrage, using highly offensive language to describe the squalor, piles of garbage, roaches, and used syringes. Numerous soundbites from the *Hoarders* episode were played.

Following this, the show interviewed Joe Berlinger, director of *Paradise Lost 3: Purgatory*, and Jason Baldwin, one of the West Memphis Three.  Baldwin detailed his wrongful conviction, coerced confession, and 18-year fight for freedom, while Berlinger discussed the documentary's challenges and the legal battles. The discussion covered the flawed investigation, the eventual exoneration based on DNA evidence, and Baldwin's post-release experiences.

The show continued with calls to the "F.U. line," featuring obscenity-laced messages, followed by a profanity-laced discussion of the upcoming presidential election, specifically targeting Mitt Romney.  This transitioned into a lengthy discussion about the bankruptcy of Hostess snack cakes and personal preferences for various treats, again with liberal use of vulgar language.  Mention was made of an upcoming episode of "Chip TV."

A later segment reviewed a "Chip-a-TV" video from New York Comic Con, featuring crude commentary on cosplayers. This was followed by another segment on Anthony from Long Island from *Hoarders*, highlighting his unsanitary living conditions, including roaches and rats. The hosts then discussed American Airlines' customer service awards, leading to a debate on ranking the most successful reality stars, including Omarosa, Snooki, Puck, and Chumlee. A caller shared a story about a beach threesome in Acapulco. The segment ended with discussion of a *Scorpion King* movie giveaway, more on the *Hoarders* segments, a call from Ron Bennington regarding a pizza party on the *Ron and Fez* show (lacking meat), and further discussion of the West Memphis Three and Jason Baldwin's experience.

The final segment addressed scheduling concerns, E-Rock's absence from a pizza party, and upcoming events like Taco Fest.  The hosts jokingly scrutinized Roland's guest-booking skills, debating the box office success of *The Green Mile* vs. *Armageddon*,  Ben Affleck's performance, and Aerosmith's involvement. The discussion then moved to reality TV, debating the most successful reality star (Richard Hatch and Omarosa were mentioned), its history, and its decline.  Roland's luck in booking Stephen Merchant was briefly mentioned. The segment concluded with plans for a wrestling segment, speculation on good wrestling shows, and a mention of a listener named Mark Zito Googling Wisconsin.  Throughout the final segment, the hosts engaged in vulgar banter and off-color jokes.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel, XM 105, Sirius 206.  And now, a show the likes of which America's never seen.  So appalling, so offensive, yet so entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  Beamed from satellites in space down to you every single day.  What planet are we living on?  It's the Opie and Anthony Show with Opie.  We're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up. 
[00:00:30]  And Anthony?  I live in a big house, I make a lot of money, and I fuck attractive girls.  And little Jimmy.  I don't even like an R-opening, it sounds like a little...  What?  You're dang over here, don't listen to the dang over here.  Stop with that shit.  And now, here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons? I'm William Shatner, goddammit.  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Let's do this! 
[00:01:00]  Oh, I barely even heard Shatner there.  Yeah, we gotta kick him out of the intro.  Mining.  Mining.  He's not appreciative.  We gave him a great honor, and he's shitting all over it.  Bye.  You know, it is fun driving home from this establishment, and I could just end it right there.  Driving home from this establishment.  I'm already in the car, driving, and I hear what is the Opie and Anthony show still on without me. 
[00:01:30]  It was great.  What happened?  Fucking Florentine was still here, Jimmy, you.  It was great.  I'm just driving down the road, like, feeling like I left the show.  But it was the shit show.  These assholes tricked us into doing more radio.  I know, I heard that.  Somebody said, hey, I think it was Jimmy.  He said, what are you doing, tricking us into talking on this shit show?  Lonely Sam.  Yep.  He didn't want to be lonely for his...  Lonely Sam.  He didn't want to be lonely.  But it's so weird.  I'm listening.  I'm like, all of a sudden, I'm a listener. 
[00:02:00]  I'm like, oh, I'm a listener of the Opie and Anthony show.  The best is to do radio on the way home.  Yes, I like that.  Where Kenny just puts us on speakerphone and we just chill out and talk.  Makes the drive go faster.  I didn't think the job could get easier.  Yeah, that's a piece of cake.  Now I'm sitting in a heated seat on the way home, still doing radio.  And you listen, less Sam, more Gooder.  Well, that's what a lot of people are saying.  I'm unfollowing Kevin from Connecticut officially.  Oh, no.  He had the nerve to DM me about Sam.  Really? 
[00:02:30]  Uh-oh.  Really?  What did he say?  What?  He goes, please, Opie, less Sam.  Oh.  So there you go.  You get unfollowed.  I don't fucking.  Wow.  Oh, that's sweet.  I'm not on Twitter for you to tell me what we need to do with the radio show.  I'm on there to enjoy myself.  Take your suggestions.  No, but I will say this is why I would unfollow him because he didn't say, please, no more Sam  at all.  That is what was the right thing.  Less Sam is the best offensive.  Less Sam implies that some Sam is appropriate. 
[00:03:00]  I don't feel any Sam is appropriate.  Oh, very good.  Some is fine.  I feel less Sam.  Less Sam.  Less oxygen for Sam.  Sam should do less breathing.  Less Sam on Earth.  Sam added his 10th radio show, so congratulations.  Yes, exactly.  You're up to 10 radio shows now, right?  I don't know if it's quite 10 yet.  What are you doing?  Give us the list really fast, including the podcast.  All right.  Well, I'm on this show.  Obviously, too much, according to Kevin.  There's the after show.  That's two.  Hits one.  That's three. 
[00:03:30]  Regularly featured on Who Kid.  That's four.  Regularly featured on Raw Dog.  Five.  Sam Roberts show online on iTunes.  Six.  You just added a weekend show, right?  And the weekend show will be on a week from Saturday.  At what time?  4 p.m. on Saturday.  So you got your hands involved in seven radio shows, and they still don't pay you.  I was going to say, you must be rolling in the old dough.  I am.  Seven shows.  I set you up just to fucking take a shot at those guys.  Have you figured out how much per show you're getting? 
[00:04:00]  Oh, that's a great idea.  Take what you get and divide it by seven.  It's got to be atrocious.  Last time I did one of those math problems, I got in a lot of trouble.  Oh, right.  Yeah, they don't like that on the air, do they?  Well, how about they just give you a raise, and then we'll shut up about it.  A real raise, not this cute little, oh, here's a few shekels.  You don't like a few shekels?  Here's a little pocket money.  It's all about the experience.  You're helping out seven radio shows, and they just ignore what's going on.  Well, helping out.  Yeah, that might be a strong word. 
[00:04:30]  That might be a stretch.  Yeah.  You're somehow destroying seven radio shows.  I didn't say he's carrying.  I was picking my words carefully.  I didn't say carrying.  Maybe they want to redistribute some of the listenership, so they put Sam where it could  drive away some listeners to go to another station.  You're like the mush at a card table.  Dr. Robin was surprised to see me again yesterday from Hoarders.  Oh, my God.  When she did Who Kid show.  It was embarrassing.  It's like, wait a minute, you're the guy?  Yeah.  How come Who Kid hasn't invited me on his show? 
[00:05:00]  Oh, boy.  He doesn't like me.  You want to do Who Kid show?  It's racial.  He likes you.  I get you on.  He likes us all.  It's racial.  Who Kid's, he's fun.  And it gets you into those communities that we normally aren't heard in, so that's good,  too.  And he loves that white audience, too.  Yeah, he does.  Does he?  Well, he's smart.  He eats that shit up, right?  He's smart.  He knows they spend money.  They're the ones with the cash.  Well, you always want to broaden yourself, too, as a performer.  You're not.  Yeah.  I like when black people like Opie and Anthony.  When black people come up to me, I'm like, really?  Yeah, yeah.  Patrice brought a lot of black people to our show. 
[00:05:30]  He did.  Oh, yes.  Yeah.  Drove away all the women, we'd make room for the black people.  There you go.  You think we'll get that with Michael Clark Duncan today?  Yeah, I think so.  He's coming in really soon, actually.  John Coffey.  Like the drink.  Like the drink, only spelled different.  He gives $5 to people in the street if they know his whole name, which I think is pretty  funny.  Oh, really?  Really?  Because people probably just know, everybody knows him.  Yeah.  Green Mile or Armageddon, but you don't know. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Well, after Armageddon, he did that movie.  He's very big.  He's kind of big, isn't he?  He's very big.  No, I'm just trying to prepare for the interview.  Actually.  So after Armageddon, there was that time you...  Jesus.  Green Mile, though, he stood on a box or something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's not that tall, obviously.  We should bring up the time we sat right next to him at WrestleMania.  That was WrestleMania, and he got it.  Where the fuck were we, Sacramento? 
[00:06:30]  I think we were in Anaheim.  Oh, Anaheim.  Right, right, right.  And he got into some little smack there with...  Who was it?  I don't know.  Sam should know.  I have no idea.  Pull out one of your fucking DVDs, you freak.  But the best part about that, that was the time I realized, holy shit, he's not as tall  as he was in Green Mile.  Yeah.  He was standing on some kind of box.  And then, I guess it came out that they redesigned the hallway, so he was a lot higher  when he was walking down the hallway and stuff.  Yeah, they did some of that movie magic.  A lot of movie magic to make him look really, really tall and big. 
[00:07:00]  He was also in Tim Burton's version of Planet of the Apes.  Oh, right.  He was in Daredevil, Sin City.  I just saw Sin City for the first time.  I forgot he was in that.  That's pretty good.  Yeah, it's a weird movie.  Yeah.  Talladega Nights.  He's done a lot of movies, actually.  Talladega Nights?  That was a cameo.  Oh, okay.  No, I'm just saying, because I don't remember him in Talladega Nights.  Did you like Talladega Nights?  Yeah, he had some laughs.  There are some laughs.  He had some chuckles.  He's not a shitload of movies.  Is Scott Greenstein in today? 
[00:07:30]  Wow.  I'm sure he will be, yeah.  I want to bring to his attention that there's a couple stall doors in the bathroom that aren't  locking properly.  Oh, the little latch.  Put your finger in.  Yeah, you got to put your pinky in there and put it in the little screw hole, not the glory  hole, the screw hole, and then slide it over, yeah.  That's who I should be talking to, right?  Probably facilities would be.  Facilities?  Maintenance, maybe.  Mars. 
[00:08:00]  What does Scott do, then?  I thought I'd go to him.  He's more administrative side.  I sat down on the bowl and the door keeps swinging open.  I like that stall because lazy people won't use it, so it's a little cleaner than the  rest.  Yeah, but then you get-  You got to stick your pinky in there and slide it over.  Then you get a guy, he pushes your door open because it's open askew.  Oh, lucky devil.  But then you're sitting in there and then you're thinking, this guy thinks I'm looking for  some action or something.  No, I'm not.  The latch is broken, you asshole. 
[00:08:30]  Is that what they're calling him?  You want to push in the door open?  He really pushed my door open and closed his door.  So I got to talk to Greenston and tell him he's got to fix the fucking latches in the  bathroom.  Yeah.  I'm sure he needs something to do today.  But that really would be funny if you went in there and you were just kind of tear-stricken.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you just kept talking about the humiliation of the door opening.  Your big, hard cock being seen.  And you said it just like that.  He saw my big, hard cock.  My big, hard, turgid cock.  By the way, you're listening to Dopey and Agony. 
[00:09:00]  Ah, yes.  You know, all these years, I mean, the Dopey is the easy one.  Dopey and Anthony.  Right.  They've gone with Dopey and Ain't Funny over the years.  Dopey and...  Anus and Anthony.  Anus and Anthony.  What else?  Dopey and Dopey.  Dopey and Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Opey and Dopey.  I've never heard Dopey and Agony.  Dopey and Ain't Funny.  Have you ever heard of...  Yeah, I did that.  Oppy and Anthony.  Oppy and Anthony.  I've never heard of that one.  Oppy and Anthony.  Well, a guy online is calling us Dopey and Agony. 
[00:09:30]  I like that one.  It's a new one.  And there was no doubt in my mind I had to tweet these two videos late last night because  usually I blow off, like, haters like this.  Yeah.  But this guy, I'm convinced, has no idea who the fuck we are.  Yeah.  He got involved in our world because of the Jesse Ventura, Chris Kyle controversy that's  continuing to grow.  Yeah.  So decided he had to make one of his fucking videos.  Yeah.  And tell the world how disgusted he is with Dopey and Agony. 
[00:10:00]  And he's obviously a Jesse Ventura conspiracy guy.  Yeah.  He's one of those guys that, like, believes the World Trade Center was taken down with  controlled explosions and shit like that.  So he's one of those guys.  The news, some of the stories that were out, of course, Chris Kyle, the sniper, saying he  punched Jesse Ventura in the face at a seal bar for some shit that Jesse said.  That got out.  Of course, we take Chris Kyle's side. 
[00:10:30]  It gets out there.  And this guy saw that.  And all of a sudden, we're assholes.  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  And where we're at with that whole thing.  Then Alex Jones got Jesse Ventura on his show.  Jesse said it never fucking happened.  So then we said, all right, let's get Chris Kyle back on the phone, which we did yesterday.  He said it absolutely happened.  And the Blaze, Stunt Brain, is working for the Blaze.  Yeah.  He put the whole audio up on the Blaze.  And he wrote me late last night saying, holy fuck, this thing is doing really well. 
[00:11:00]  This thing is not going away.  Because now we got Chris Kyle saying he absolutely punched Jesse.  Jesse saying it absolutely didn't happen.  Right.  So that's where we're at today.  And this.  In a quandary.  And now.  Yeah, sorry.  This lunatic.  I don't know where he's from.  Because his accent is just.  It's half retard, half somewhere.  Well, one guy said, I'm not sure if he's from.  I'm not sure if he's Irish or from Minnesota.  That made me laugh all fucking night.  The people commenting on these videos have been just fucking great. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, yeah.  One guy congratulated us.  Congratulated us because, well, we're part of the military.  Yeah, we're agents for the military industrial complex.  Yeah.  So one guy tweeted me and said, congratulations on your promotion.  Yeah.  I'm pretty excited about that.  An agent.  He goes into some of the World Trade Center stuff.  It's just ridiculous.  And this morning, I woke up a little early this morning and couldn't get back to sleep,  so I was watching the Smithsonian Channel. 
[00:12:00]  I think it was that.  And, or maybe Nat Geo, they had demolition teams.  And I watched like two shows of how they were taking down certain buildings and structures  at Cape Kennedy.  And it's really an amazing thing to watch them take these buildings down when there's  other shit around it and they got to make sure it falls in the proper place.  And when you watch those shows and see the weeks of work that goes into the preparation  of setting up a building to be exploded, imploded, actually, and fall in a certain spot, for anybody 
[00:12:30]  to say that was done at the Trade Center is fucking moronic.  The way they have to cut the beams.  There was something like 600 beams in this smaller building, obviously a lot smaller than  the Trade Center, 600 beams had to be what they call box cut with oxyacetylene torches  cutting slots in every single beam to put shape charges on the I-beams so it comes down  in a certain way. 
[00:13:00]  And the cables, the fucking primer cord, the shit that's running through this, it's an  amazing display of engineering.  It's frustrating you've got to live in the same world as these dummies.  You don't do it in a day where they said they told employees not to show up on a certain  day where they could do all this.  Oh, really?  You know, all the secretaries and people working in the Trade Center and the maintenance crews  and everything took a day off so they could do a month's worth of work in one day or even  a week, whatever.  And as time goes by, you've got more and more people jumping on this bandwagon. 
[00:13:30]  Oh, I know.  Believing it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  That's how these conspiracies grow.  It's so retarded.  And get more popular.  You need time to go by.  I'm saying, don't even look at the World Trade Center version of it.  Look at any version of what it takes to implode a vacant, abandoned building.  Right.  And you tell me how that is done in a building, one of the biggest buildings in the world,  where people are working.  Right.  The best way to do it, though, is to get a bunch of people to karate kick it on one side 
[00:14:00]  at the same time.  Well, that I haven't checked into, but I'm sure it could be done.  And it buckles.  It buckles.  Let's get into this guy's videos because we're busy.  We've got Michael Clark Duncan coming in in a mere half hour.  So I want to try to squeeze this in.  This is the first video the guy made.  It's entitled, Navy SEAL Sharpshooter Chris Kyle Punch Jesse Ventura Claims on Opie and  Anthony.  Okay.  And what's this guy's name?  Do we even know?  His YouTube name.  I called him Aging Agent Smith.  He looks like, ah, Mr. Anderson. 
[00:14:30]  Or he looks a little like Kiefer Sutherland in the future.  And people were asking me, why are you giving a guy like this attention?  The guy made me howl.  Yeah.  It's just because he's funny.  So I figured our listeners would love to check this out.  Sure.  And then I'm thinking, yeah, we'll play it on the air as well.  Give him all the attention he wants.  Yes.  He's a nut job.  You're about to hear a nut job.  Beautiful Girl by Dana.  Ew. 
[00:15:00]  What's that about?  I hate me.  Very strange.  Ew.  I wonder what he's up to when he's not making his little YouTube videos.  I almost said I hate my name, Dana, and realized I'm a friend of mine, whose organization  I enjoy.  I shouldn't say that.  Dana.  Here we go.  So the Opie and Anthony show, this is, I didn't even know how to classify these guys.  Wait, he's somebody Scottish.  Scottish or Irish, I think.  Or? 
[00:15:30]  These guys.  I don't think he's British.  Or according to one of the guys that tweeted last night, he might be from Minnesota.  Because he's saying, hey, these guys.  You're Canadian.  That makes sense.  Well, someone says, a few people said Canada because he went with about.  Maybe he's from the Knights of St. Andrews.  I don't know.  The accent's all over the place.  Maybe he's from Scotland originally, but he lives in Canada.  I don't know.  And then he got kicked in the mouth with a horse.  And he went through Minnesota and stopped there for a little while. 
[00:16:00]  I hate his sweater.  It's like Alex Rieger.  I know.  Someone said it's the Mr. Roper sweater.  Oh, yeah.  You should be dancing.  Oh, it was Iraq.  Sorry, Iraq.  And I even commented.  That was a good tweet.  Yeah, Iraq tweeted that last night.  All right, let's go.  Navy SEAL on there.  And they literally get down and lick his ass the whole time.  So they were baiting him on is what they were doing.  And this guy claims he sucker punched Jesse Ventura.  We're masturbators.  Because Jesse Ventura was upsetting family at a funeral for a Navy SEAL. 
[00:16:30]  Well, yet, at the end of the conversation, he says, you know, I had to blast out of there  because I knew by hitting him the cops are watching us and yada, yada, yada.  Yada, yada, yada.  I love that episode.  Look, I grew up.  There was no such thing as TV or radio where I was told I ran a trap line.  Everything I ate, I shot or I got out of the ocean.  What?  Oh, everything.  So I know how to read people because that's what we done back then.  We talked to people.  We didn't have the Internet. 
[00:17:00]  If you're hunting and fishing, you're not really talking to anyone.  You're by yourself mostly.  He's talking to the fish.  Right.  Exactly.  Because he's the old man in the sea.  The old dope in the sea.  You might have a few hunting buddies with you, maybe.  Yeah.  But you're really not seeing a lot of people in the woods.  Everything he got.  Or in a boat.  He shot it or got it out of the ocean.  I fucking love this guy.  There's a lot of fucking just zeros out there.  A lot of zilches.  And YouTube really brings them out.  Oh, yeah.  They have a forum, a place to talk.  Yes, their forum, finally. 
[00:17:30]  It becomes very entertaining for us.  Or anything.  So you had a, you talked about 40 people every day.  And that guy just, he smells of lois.  Literally smells of lois.  As opposed to, could you pause it for a minute?  As opposed to Jesse Ventura, who if you watch his dopey-ass conspiracy show in the past,  everything on there is full of shit.  His sources are these people that are trying to make like their secret agents and they're 
[00:18:00]  just fucking actors or something.  He comes up with these scenarios as to why he can't get in a certain facility.  And it's all horse shit.  That's the guy.  That's the truth, though.  That's what your years of talking to fish and moose fucking told you over the years,  you dork.  With your Mr. Roper sweater.  Yeah.  He's awful, this guy.  I love him.  You'll never win a logical argument with him because he's just fucking.  No, there's no talking to this guy. 
[00:18:30]  He's a lunatic.  Crazy man.  Back up slightly there, Sam, and start it up again.  There we go.  ...lois.  Literally smells of lois.  But Opie and Anthony, just shitheads.  Oh.  You know, they had Louis C.K. on their show and they threw him under the bus immediately  because he asked Donald Rumsfeld, was he a lizard?  I mean, he was just trying to get a laugh.  Oh, really?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Pause.  Fuck, man.  I want to apologize right now to Louis C.K. because I didn't know he was going for a laugh. 
[00:19:00]  And if you listen to that, you could definitely tell I was very angry with Louis.  Wait, wait.  So what happened?  What an asshole.  How did we throw Louis under the bus?  We didn't realize that he was just going for a laugh and decided to push the agenda?  Yes.  And I was totally defending Donald Rumsfeld during that instead of him.  Do you realize that Anthony was trying to do a real interview with Donald Rumsfeld that  day and Louis decided to have fun?  What I was doing was called keeping Donnie on the phone so Louis can fuck with Donald 
[00:19:30]  Rumsfeld.  And talk about how he might be a lizard.  Exactly.  It was hilarious.  But if he did that without an input of somebody that was actually talking to him about his  book and everything, he would have hung up.  And we wouldn't have had that Louis C.K.  magic of calling Donald Rumsfeld a lizard or asking if he's an alien.  It's called Good Cop, Bad Cop.  We've done it for years on this show.  But this idiot, like Opie said, doesn't know this show or anything and assume we were throwing  Louis under the bus.  That's why this guy's the greatest. 
[00:20:00]  Canada has checked in today.  Oh, Canada is in the hizzy.  One, two, three, four phone calls from Canada.  They're all saying he's from Newfoundland.  A newfie?  He's a newfie.  Fucking newfie.  That's the N-word up in Canada, by the way.  You fucking newfie.  Let's go to Matt to make this official.  Matt, what are you saying there, sir?  It's Mark.  All right.  What's up, Mark?  It's Mark.  Yeah, he's definitely a Newfoundlander. 
[00:20:30]  I'm married to one and they sound identical.  Sounds just like that, huh?  Except mine's a girl.  That's a guy.  Oh.  Well, why does he sound like he's from Scotland, like Jimmy's saying?  They're descendants from Scotland and Ireland.  Really?  Okay.  Scotland and Ireland.  I think we got a...  Like a cheap fuck, I bet, right?  Derek, you're backing that up.  Yes, sir.  Back that shit up.  He's a newfie.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  There you go.  Thank God for Canada today.  Let's get back to the video. 
[00:21:00]  Was he a lizard?  I mean, he was just trying to get a laugh.  Wow.  We know that.  These guys are so anal.  They're so anal.  That they have to be political...  Lapdogs, cheerleaders, no matter what it is.  That Navy SEAL, he killed, you know, women and children.  He even braves about it.  I'm sure he does.  But acne and opening, you're in there.  Blub, blub, blub, blub, blub, blub, blub, blub, blub, like little lizards licking his ass.  It's absolutely disgusting.  He did a little licky thing. 
[00:21:30]  And that's why they get the attention, because they're willing to get out there and lick boots.  Because that's what they do.  You can just tell by their voices, this is all they've ever done is lick boots.  He can tell by voices from fishing and shooting.  Okay.  That Navy SEAL, he's a bullshitter.  Plain and simple.  At least he was shooting people that were shooting back at him.  He's a big, new piece.  He's bragging about the 5 million orphans in Iraq and Afghanistan.  He's bragging about the 4.5 million dead.  How he had participated in this.  If it wasn't for the fucking American military, you fucking asshole, newfie shithead, your country would have been overrun by the communists back during the Cold War. 
[00:22:00]  You do nothing, fucker.  Shut up, Canada.  Lick our ass.  Blub, blub, blub, blub.  Lick America's ass, Canada.  Blub, blub, blub, blub.  You stupid mounted police.  What are they going to do when MiGs are bombing your whole fucking shit country?  Who's bombing them?  The commies.  Back in the old days.  The MiGs.  No, the MiGs.  Wait, wait, wait.  But with your fucking, with your, a quarter of your country is even usable. 
[00:22:30]  The rest is an ice maker.  They got a giant ice cube maker.  What are you doing, man?  Canada loves us.  Ah, fuck this guy.  He's basing, I'm basing my entire opinion of Canada on this nut.  Let's keep it to Newfoundland.  Is that how you say it?  Newfies.  Just say Newfies.  Yeah, Newfies.  Go after the Newfies.  All right.  Leave the rest of Canada alone.  Oh, Canada.  All right, let's go.  19,000 rapes in the military.  18 soldiers committing suicide in the streets every day. 
[00:23:00]  I'm taking a go with the bad.  Blast and depleted uranium all over that country.  It's no toxic wasteland on the planet right now.  Except for Newfoundland.  Fucking Anthony and Anthony.  Degenerates, man.  Yeah.  Truly degenerates.  Thank you.  And that's it.  That should be our intro.  That should be the last thing in our intro instead of Shatner.  Fuck you.  Anthony and Anthony.  Degenerates.  Truly degenerates.  Yeah, let's work that audio into the open.  That's hilarious.  Congratulations to this guy.  You made our open.  Yeah.  I like it.  It's an honor.  So that was the video he put out right away after Chris Kyle was on our show. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, there's more.  And then he put out it.  Oh, yeah.  He's obsessed with us.  He seems a little drunker in the next one.  Wait, wait.  Yeah.  This one gets way better because he calls us Dopey and Agony.  Do you know what I love that he said in that last one, too?  D's.  D's.  D's.  Shitheads.  Yeah.  Opey and Agony.  D's.  Shitheads.  It was that deliciousness of that word in his mouth.  It's not the reaction.  Well, I guess he was going for it because I'm howling.  Yeah.  I understand hating this guy.  I don't hate him. 
[00:24:00]  And I'm saying to Anthony.  Oh.  Oh, I know.  Dude, he's such a fucking.  He's such a Mr. Drummond looking bag of shit.  Oh, he is.  Yes.  Mr. Drummond.  Don't be adopting two little poor black children.  Go ahead.  That's terrible.  The new video, which he put up, I guess, two days ago.  The Opey and Anthony show breeds violent, dangerous extremism.  As opposed to Jesse Ventura.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Of course.  This guy's a goose.  Hit it.  The Opey and Anthony show.  They're following.  Oh, and look at all the.  Well, you can't see it out there in Radioland, but look at all the fucking edits. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  This guy was at this for a while.  Yeah.  He cut this up.  Yeah.  He must have said some stupid things.  Yeah.  Or something that made sense.  Yeah, maybe that's it.  You know, really, Jesse Ventura is a shithead who likes to hear himself talk.  I better cut that out.  I better not leave that in.  I think his accent makes this so much fun to listen to.  That's my favorite part.  Opey and Anthony.  These shitheads.  Shitheads.  Shitheads.  All right, let's go.  The second video. 
[00:25:00]  The Dopey and Agni show.  Their followers are violent extremists.  That's what these people are.  I've done a quick video about Dopey and Agni show having Chris Coylander claiming he punched out Jesse Ventura.  Now, that was thoroughly debunked.  Of course, if you look at it five years ago and it's still never come out until you get on the show.  Pause that real quick.  You know what I love?  If you look in the background, of course, this chair next to him is empty.  Of course it is.  Yeah.  But it's against the fucking curtain to keep the light out.  Yeah.  Yeah, it looks like a towel just hanging on the button. 
[00:25:30]  It's either a towel or a drape.  He's got it pressed.  This guy doesn't like daylight.  No, not at all.  No.  Oh, right.  The chair is pressed against there to keep the light from coming in.  To keep the light from coming in.  And washing his camera out.  He won't ruin his production.  Oh, good point.  All right.  All right.  He's still never come out until you get on the show and have to drag it out of a guy who won't look him in the eyes or look at the camera.  It was pretty obvious what was going on.  But now that it's been thoroughly debunked, like you say, Jesse Ventura come out, thoroughly debunked it. 
[00:26:00]  And it's going to have this guy charged with slander.  And it's going to try to go after the Dopey and Agony show.  This is kind of what that video is about.  The Dopey and Agony show, their mentality.  It's only on their videos will you find, like on my video, you'll find people saying they want to smash your teeth out.  Keep calling it a C word.  They use every derogatory term on the planet, but they can't argue or debate.  They're violent.  Dopey and Agony breeds violence.  And you see this consistently with anybody who disagrees with the Dopey and Agony show at all. 
[00:26:30]  But dangerous mindless zombies are probably using a PR firm on top of that.  But it's most likely these guys themselves.  PR firm.  I know.  What does he think?  That this show is organized?  Yeah, really?  A PR firm.  They probably have after show meetings and do show prep.  I just don't know what the fuck he's talking about.  They have a marketing department for the show.  That was the only part of the video that made me sad.  PR department.  That would be nice.  These guys probably have a good relationship with management. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  And our PR department is me, in this case, fucking writing Stunt Brain and going, hey, I might  have something for you.  These dopes down the hall don't even, they haven't done anything with this story.  This fucking thing is growing.  And we have a, I guess we have a PR department at the company and they haven't done shit.  Yeah.  What are they doing?  Nothing.  Stunt Brain said, holy shit, get me the audio.  That was amazing radio yesterday.  And then wrote me last night and said, eight hours later, it's the number one story on 
[00:27:30]  The Blaze still.  And these idiots down the hall don't get that?  The Blaze?  Oh, The Blaze.  Butch of Lois.  They like fire.  Fucking Lois, The Blaze.  It's a good jacket with an R on it.  Right.  You got it.  Voilens.  You got the secretaries, Gary and Rob.  They had no idea that this might be good radio, so they had no idea to pass it on to PR.  Then you got Blatter, who oversees Gary and Rob.  He didn't do anything.  And then Greenstein, who we haven't seen in over a month, and I got to talk to him about  the latches in the bathroom. 
[00:28:00]  That's where we're at today.  Who Green mean?  I was going to make up names for everybody like this guy.  Yeah.  Who Gary and Bob?  Yeah.  Just unfunny names that kind of sound like it.  Who?  Mary and Rob.  Is he marrying himself?  This guy rules.  I love him.  Steve Batter.  See, because he's worse.  Yeah, he looks like Jughead.  He shakes his head.  Jughead.  Sometimes he closes his mouth and he squirts his eyes and shakes his head disapprovingly.  And you see Gary coming down the hall like an apparition. 
[00:28:30]  He looks like a screensaver with his little glasses just floating down the hall.  What a bunch of fucking wankers.  Yeah, it's a big, a big giant jar of incompetence around here.  We don't know what's going on.  Club Soda Kenny's over there with his Miss Meany glasses looking at the computer.  He's violent.  He's a big, violent guy with $6.71 suits.  His suits cost less than $7.  And Sam over here, he's been on so many shows.  We don't know if he's black or white.  We just know he's got no talent. 
[00:29:00]  And he's violent.  He's very violent.  Very violent.  And his mother, his mother loves him too much.  Is PR working this story at all?  Nothing, right?  You'd have to ask.  Yeah, nothing.  Of course not.  We gave it to him.  I know Jimmy was all about that a couple days ago and they've done nothing, right?  Yeah, I said, Jimmy said that we should get it to Breitbart.  Another lapdog in his entire organization of lapdogs.  Bootlicking Breitbart.  Bootlicking military industrial complex.  Yeah.  Fucking puppets. 
[00:29:30]  What?  What's that in there?  Looks like an e-boulder.  That's the only thing I like about Dopey and Agony.  They make fun of the fat kid behind the glass.  Just sits there all day.  Does nothing.  Does even less than this empty chair next to me.  His shits are violent.  They really are.  They actually start coming out while he's mumbling down the hallway.  And he has to sit on the toilet.  And he just pulls down his pants and they shoot into the toilet.  Very violently.  Much like the planes into the buildings which were filled with dynamite.  Thermite paint comes brookening out his eyes. 
[00:30:00]  Brown thermite paint.  Let's go back to the video.  Zombies.  They're probably using a PR firm on top of that.  I wish.  But it's most likely these guys themselves with YouTube accounts are putting these threats  out there because they're so small money.  You can tell that by watching their show.  And they haven't come out with a retraction about what they said about just ensuring  and apologize to Jesse Ventura. 
[00:30:30]  What'll do?  And they won't because they're intimidated by Jesse Ventura and they hate him.  Oh, yeah.  They're intimidated.  You're half right.  They can't debate.  So all they can do is have anger.  Yep.  And that's what they're teaching people that fall for their gig.  Yep.  The Dopey and Agony show is a smut machine.  You can't debate anything.  We're just a smut machine.  Dan.  Dan.  They come to my site and they start yelling about how they smacked down the truthers.  The top 15 stories of the Twin Towers can only crush 15 stories below it.  That's the laws of physics. 
[00:31:00]  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  You're telling me the laws of physics.  There was no bodies, no seats, no wings, tails, engines.  Yes, there was.  Yes, there was.  Black boxes.  No, nothing.  Yeah, there was all kinds of fun playing shit.  Worldwide in the media.  Except for a couple of debunking sites.  It wasn't reported in the media.  None of that.  I'm making arguments that I heard in 2002 on some video done by a college guy who's  been proven to be an asshole.  Yeah, an arse.  He's an arse.  He's a complete arse.  But his face is jumping all over the place because there's so many edits.  Oh, edits like crazy.  He can't get his argument together.  This guy's the greatest. 
[00:31:30]  Michael J. Fox did my editing for me.  He just ran in with scissors and started cutting.  He doesn't acknowledge that a plane went into the building.  Right.  We have video of that.  No engines, no plane parts.  Yeah, there was an engine on a fucking street.  Stop it.  And what about all those phone calls to people and the messages from their loved ones?  Well, I can't explain that so I won't say it.  Yeah, I won't bring that up.  Yeah, I'll just continue my open collared sweater shirt combination.  I want you to kill every golfer on the golf course. 
[00:32:00]  The most offensive part of him is his brown curtain and his beige sweater and his brown  chair.  I like earth tones.  You know, I find that earth tones are peaceful and not violent, like Dopey and Agony.  He loves earth tones.  What violent.  He really does.  Where do you get a colored shirt like that?  I've never seen that color before.  African-American shirts.  Stop.  Oh, really?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Whoops.  I make my shirts drink out of a different waterfall than my white t-shirts.  Let's get back to this. 
[00:32:30]  Except for a couple of debunking sites, it wasn't reported in the media, none of that.  There were no bodies, no seats, no luggage, no wings, tails, engines, planes at the Pentagon,  Flight 77 or Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.  The loved ones never got the bodies, never got to bury the bodies.  So they put memorials at those sites to represent the bodies.  Rewind one second.  I just want to hear him cough in the middle of his thing.  Yeah, yeah.  I thought that was half a laugh.  That's great.  The loved ones never got the bodies, never got to bury the bodies. 
[00:33:00]  So they put memorials at those sites to represent the bodies.  Represent the bodies.  Represent the bodies.  What a complete asshole this guy is.  I just knew we had to give the same attention.  I just knew it, man.  Wings, tails, engines, planes at the Pentagon, Flight 77 or Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. 
[00:33:30]  The loved ones never got the bodies, never got to bury the bodies.  So they put memorials at those sites to represent the bodies.  They got all the people killed at the Pentagon, but they never got the bodies from the plane  or the seats, luggage, wings, tails, engines, black boxes.  And you got no physical proof.  Nobody can find that.  It's not carried on any of the sites.  And that's why 9-1-1 truth is asking, where is this evidence, right?  The greatest form of patriotism is dissent and to hold your government accountable.  Oh, is that it?  Where'd you read that? 
[00:34:00]  Stop quoting our people.  And then he has a fucking...  Yeah, some 9-11, some Building 7.  And I'm not trying to give you a history lesson or nothing, but I want to bring it into context.  The Dopey and Agony show, they should be retracting this immediately.  The other ones kicked all this off.  And they go to Chris Coyle into saying that story.  He bragged about it, obviously, before that.  And they reminded him.  They wanted to confirm it on there because they wanted to make a sensational story.  Because that's what they do, right? 
[00:34:30]  We are sensational.  Go to Louis C.K.'s and look up the Donald Rumsfeld video and listen to it.  And you will hear them throw him under the bus repeatedly.  And that was the first time we ever had him on the show.  What?  And he got him back on the show repeatedly, apparently, after.  But that was because...  That was the first time we had Louis C.K. on the show?  They wanted to reach off of his fame.  I'm amazed.  It's not because they...  You see what they've done with him in that video, you'll understand what I'm saying.  Yeah.  Dopey and Agony, though.  Dopey and Agony.  Every time you make a video about these people or you criticize them, you're attacked viciously with threats of violence. 
[00:35:00]  Tourette's of violence?  I smashed my teeth in on my last video.  He's probably your webmaster.  He's an idiot.  He really is.  How are the comments on this video?  I think he disabled comments, didn't he?  No, of course he did.  No, he can still comment.  Oh, okay, good.  There's a paragraph that just starts with, hey, asshole.  Don't you love the fact, though, that these truthers, every one of them is, like, just a boob?  Just a dumb lummox.  What the fuck, man? 
[00:35:30]  There's not one of these guys that actually don't come off like a stark-raving lunatic.  Just douches.  My favorite comment that I've read.  This guy has the balls to call out Dopey and Agony.  I think he's a genius.  I'm going to call SiriusXM now to cancel my subscription.  Or something.  He tags it with a little chuck.  Yeah, if you guys are going to make comments on this guy's videos, don't make them all idiotic chip remarks,  because he's not going to know what that means.  What do you like, browns or something? 
[00:36:00]  You look like you're wearing duty.  Right, right.  He wouldn't even know what that meant.  No, he'd probably go, they're all putting TSS sounds like dynamite.  That's the sound a fuse makes when you're light.  They put some funny, he'd probably light chip.  But some of the comments with the assumptions are really funny and well thought out.  But aside from that, there's really a bunch of dreck.  That guy's hilarious.  But I didn't like the sound of toxic gas being poured in.  Yeah, Chype Chyperson.  I don't like him.  Chype Chyperson.  Yes, I think he's a Swedish diplomat. 
[00:36:30]  Chype Chyperson, he's a big spy.  He was in Tinker Tinker Run Soldier, hat wearer, spy, store owner, shopkeeper.  Longest title in movie history.  Tinker Soldier, dancer, tap dancer, hugger.  Spy.  Spy.  All right, let's continue.  And constantly going after me in a derogatory term.  How could you keep a secret like that?  A bar brawl where he got knocked out.  There's no police reports or anything like that.  Did you pause that?  Apparently, I think that the entire U.S. government can keep the bringing down of the tower as a secret. 
[00:37:00]  But I don't think that Jesse Ventura getting punched in his riffraff face can be kept under wraps by 10 Navy SEALs.  I'm an inconsistent dumb cunt.  That's right.  Apparently, I think that the entire military can conspire to knock down the buildings and to cover it up and to hate all the buddies and to give false information to the families.  But I don't think that Jesse Ventura getting socked in his big foot, larger than life head, can be kept a secret by guys in the military whose whole thing is to keep secrets. 
[00:37:30]  God, I'm a cunt.  I'm such a cunt.  I used to just put on Brown and call myself a cunt.  Bravo.  And Jesse is going after that guy now and is going to expose all of this.  So that's going to come out soon.  Yep.  But the media doesn't want to cover it because that's going to give Jesse exposure.  And because Jesse Ventura had made documentaries on Truth Network, was that I believe? 
[00:38:00]  About 9-1-1 and the Pentagon and stuff like that.  He's being attacked and they're trying to discredit him.  Yeah?  Yeah.  And he's done that on purpose.  They knew it was bullet.  They carried through with it.  They sensationalized it on purpose.  And I can guarantee you, payback is coming.  Navy SEALs right now are looking up their schedules to see where they might be able to run into these little cheerleading laptops.  Because that's what Navy SEALs do when they want to go on a mission.  They have to check their eye calendar and see where they're supposed to be. 
[00:38:30]  They look up their little schedule.  That's how they got Bin Laden.  They all realized they were going to be in Pakistan the same night.  Hey, wait.  I can't go.  And you have a dentist department.  Sorry, guys.  I think they're looking up our calendars.  Oh.  See where we're going to be.  Yeah.  We all know Jim Norton's going to be at Tempe at the Improv 27th and 28th.  And he'll be doing the anti-social network.  I'm sure you're hoping the Navy SEALs come out to your show.  I'd love that.  Of course.  Some kind of violence. 
[00:39:00]  Let's try to get through this video.  Is that a threat?  Michael Clark Duncan is here.  See, Anthony and Opney or Don't Be in Agony, whatever you want to call these people.  Don't Be in Agony.  They're not going to tell you about 18 suicides in the military every single day.  Today, 18 soldiers died.  No.  On the streets, homeless.  What?  But they all sensationalized that one guy who claims he killed women and children.  Because they were all quite caught in his eyes, basically.  They loved that.  They were like little lizards licking at their butts. 
[00:39:30]  That's what they wanted.  Please do it again.  They wanted that story out there desperately.  Please do the lizard.  They despised Jesse Ventura because you didn't have the brains to argue with.  I used the same reptilian analogy for everything I'm talking about.  When my last girlfriend left me, of course she did.  I said, what are you, slinking out of here like a lizard or something?  Hey, what are you, some kind of a gecko?  Yeah.  Just because I ejaculate very quickly like a lizard tail.  I come so fast, I'm like a lizard tongue.  That's all he does.  Lizard analogies. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  My bankers like some kind of iguana.  Yeah.  It's green with envy like a lizard and chip.  ...with him and debate him like a normal radio host would do.  Wow.  Right?  So he turned on Jesse during a live interview.  Just turned on him.  Yep.  And turned into a...  The next several days they raged on him.  Yep.  But they weren't able to debate what he said.  Yep.  And like I say, top 15 stories of the Twin Towers can only crush 15 stories below it.  And it runs out of energy.  Look. 
[00:40:30]  That's the lies of physics.  You can't...  Lies of physics.  You can't suspend that.  What?  But Opie and Dopey and Agony...  Three of us now.  Their followers are violent extremists.  That's what these people...  Violent extremists.  The Dopey and Agony show?  They breed violent extremists to attack people that want to question questionable stories.  Question questionable questions.  Minions to their wives.  And sensational wives... 
[00:41:00]  Think about a dress.  Going in somewhere where there's 19,000 roots a year.  18 suicides.  That's all well documented.  There's going to be more suicides, people watching this.  But they want to come in and smash my teeth because I dare question their story.  No one wants to smash your teeth, sir.  How dare you question the Dopey and Agony show?  How dare you?  Get used to it, man.  I'm not going away.  And there's a lot of people that are just like me.  Please don't go away.  Yeah.  Are not going to be marginalized by cheerleading lapdogs for military industrial machines. 
[00:41:30]  Any day soon, I'll come through it.  His little cough.  Back up a little bit.  A quarter of an inch.  I've got to hear it again.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  I love when he coughs through it.  Oh, boy.  That's a creep.  What do you think that cough's about?  I don't know.  No, no.  I hope it's tuberculosis.  Maybe it's the AIDS.  Yeah, I shouldn't have been laying there just...  All right, good.  Capdogs for military industrial machine.  Any day soon, I'll come through it.  Take care.  Take care.  Yeah.  Oi.  I got a cough and hiccups at the same time.  I can't control myself on video. 
[00:42:00]  It's easy to reach out on YouTube and, you know...  Love him.  Throw your barbs.  We should take a quick break and get Michael Clark Duncan in here.  Michael Clark Duncan's coming in.  I got to take a leak, so let's do this.  We can talk about that guy a little later.  Oi.  We'll get back to him because a lot of people want to comment.  Oi.  Quick, quick, quick, quick.  Opie and Anthony.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, let's do this.  Michael Clark Duncan has entered the studio.  How you doing, sir?  How you doing, Joe?  Oh, man, you're a big guy.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, he is.  We briefly met many years ago at WrestleMania.  Oh, man.  Oh, man, that's right.  Back in Anaheim years ago.  I love WrestleMania.  A long time ago.  Vince McMahon used to take care of us.  He gave us the nice VIP treatment to WrestleMania. 
[00:43:00]  And where was it again at?  Anaheim.  Anaheim.  And you were pretty much sitting in the same area as we were, but you got involved with  the action.  Yeah, just a little bit.  And we're trying to remember who you were involved with.  What was the storyline?  Was it Undertaker?  Was it Undertaker?  No, they just told me they were going to give me some shit when they came out.  Yeah, so they kind of, some guy got in your face and you stood up and like, yeah.  And everybody went crazy and everything.  Yeah, yeah, like, ah, it's going to be some shit.  No, no, no. 
[00:43:30]  That was it.  That's good that that was the extent of your wrestling thing.  I don't want to do that.  Those guys are good.  Goddamn, that voice.  Way more athletic.  That's a nice voice.  Did you do a lot of voiceover work?  A lot.  You have, right?  But you know, I went to school at the Academy of Radio Broadcasting in Los Angeles, and  actually, I was doing this.  Really?  And an audition for Armageddon came up.  Got to take that one.  Yeah, I took that one, but this was my first love.  That little movie.  That just one little audition, you know.  We're just the opposite.  We do this because we failed at everything else. 
[00:44:00]  You're forced to do it.  You're forced to.  You're going to pay rent.  Now, you guys look relaxed up here.  Yeah, you know.  The Yorkers have a different attitude.  It's more of a real attitude.  You know, I was in the store last night.  A dude just walked past me.  He just said, respect.  And I was like, yeah, that's cool.  That's not like in L.A., man.  You know, nobody says just respect.  Right.  And you know what he meant.  And it's just a different mentality up here with New York.  Yeah.  Because, see, I'm cold.  You guys aren't cold. 
[00:44:30]  I'm freezing.  Oh, yeah?  I have the big cold.  You're cold, yeah.  This is easy.  This winter is easy.  Are you serious?  This is easy.  It hasn't been that bad.  We're lucky so far.  What is it, 40 degrees out, maybe?  Yeah, it's nothing.  That's easy.  I don't like it at all.  I don't like the cold at all.  I don't either.  Yeah.  Now, how do you guys make it through every winter?  The bad ones, it's just you just got to suck it up and go outside, and it's miserable.  So you know what you have to do, and you just...  Yeah.  You huddle over your steering wheel while you drive.  Yeah.  For some reason, when your nose is against the windshield, that's supposed to keep you warmer 
[00:45:00]  when you're driving until you heat up.  But you know how you deal with it?  I lived in Buffalo for three years.  Oh, that was worse.  So you go and live somewhere else where it's worse, and then you come back to this, and  now it's easy.  You used to have single digits up there.  I'm from Chicago, but...  Oh, okay.  No?  What are you talking about?  I've been in LA for 15 years.  It's a big difference now.  But you have to remember, though, Chicago wins.  Chicago's got to be way worse than even Buffalo.  You know what the thing was?  When I was trying to decide what kind of career I wanted, I said, it's only two places to 
[00:45:30]  go, New York and LA.  And 15 years ago, I was sitting, I was homeless, and I said, well, I'm not going to no place  cold anymore.  And I went to the West Coast, man.  Good choice, man.  Yeah, for me, it was.  Wait, did you say homeless in there?  Yeah, I used to be homeless, man.  I was homeless twice in my life.  December 24th, 1996, I was on the lakefront, on 47th Street in the lakefront, homeless.  I had four White Castle, two large fries, an apple pie, and an orange drink.  I remember it, because I thought that was going to be my last meal.  Oh, that was it. 
[00:46:00]  And it was really a trying time, and I was in this 67 Buick.  I had three garbage bags full of clothes, and I said, well, this is it for you.  This is what it's come to.  Everything that you've done in life has got you right here.  Now, what are you going to do?  I said, first of all, stop crying.  Too big to be crying.  Nobody's around.  What are you crying for?  But can I ask how it got to the point you got homeless?  Just making bad choices in life.  I never smoked, never drank, nothing like that.  But just, I thought that, man, I thought I was the greatest lover in the world. 
[00:46:30]  So I thought, hey, shoot, I should be taken care of, you know?  It just didn't work out that way.  Oh, there's nothing sadder than someone who expects to be, like, sugar-mommed.  Oh, wait till they get a load of this.  They'll pay my rent.  Yeah, they'll pay my rent.  This is a good gimmick right here.  And unfortunately, some people get tired of that.  When they're going to work every day, you're just letting them, hey, guess what happened  on all my children?  You'll never believe who came back. 
[00:47:00]  What are you doing?  You're 6'5", 300 pounds, and you're watching all my children?  Oh, that's funny.  So after that, I just said, you know what, I got to get out of here.  And a friend of mine called me.  She said, hey, we got an opening for security.  She said, but you got to travel.  I'm like, I'm good.  I'm good to travel.  She said, but we leave next week, and the owner would like to see you.  So I went down to the Every Crown Theater, met Shelly Garrett, who at that time had Beauty  Shop on the map.  He was traveling, and he said, I need an extra security guy. 
[00:47:30]  I said, I'm ready.  You're the guy.  I left the Buick at the lakefront and hopped on these custom coaches, and we toured for  a year, and our last stop was Los Angeles.  And also, didn't you work for Biggie, too?  Yeah, I was supposed to work for Biggie Smalls the night that that happened.  Wow.  Wow.  And a friend of mine called me and said, hey, you want to switch?  I said, well, who you got?  He said, I got Babyface.  I said, oh, that's cool.  I said, yeah, let's switch.  So we just switched information.  And I went to Soul Train Music Awards with Babyface. 
[00:48:00]  Is your friend OK?  Was he shot, or was he OK?  No, he was in the second band.  Wow.  The first band went through, and the other two security things got stopped at the light.  So I know me.  When I work security, I always sit shotgun.  I never just have a person.  Like, if I'm with you, I'm not going to let you sit right there.  That's just not me.  So I would have sat that side.  But once that happened, and he called me the next morning, and he said, Michael, you 
[00:48:30]  never guessed what happened.  It happened so quick.  This happened.  I said, are you serious?  He said, yeah, I quit security.  Wow.  That was my last day working security.  That was it, huh?  And I just said, it's not for me.  Yeah, because you're technically with guys who can be targets.  That's why they have security.  And you have to jump in front.  Yeah.  It's like Secret Service.  That's your job.  Yeah, it is.  If you're ready for that.  Wow.  But you're not physically trained.  Right.  Like a Secret Service.  It's just like you're going out there and carrying a gun.  You're not really trained.  Yeah.  So how do you do that?  And if your mentality isn't there to go push you out of the way, you know, and me take 
[00:49:00]  a shot, it's no insurance on that.  It's no, you know, you just have a gun.  You just have a big gun.  It does sound like a crazy gig.  It really is a frightening job.  It is.  Yeah, without all that training it takes to automatically do something like it's second  nature.  You have to see things before it happens.  You'd be like, fuck, dude, so I'm not doing this.  I would just make believe I was getting in the way.  I would just make believe that I try to make my move.  That you move that quickly, huh?  Yeah, just die.  Ah, I just missed it. 
[00:49:30]  I would act like I didn't see it.  Like, what happened?  That's right.  Oh, no, because I'm looking at that guy.  Oh.  Oh, we're supposed to look at other people?  I'm sorry.  I thought you said I was okay.  Yeah.  Yes, mate.  No, you can't do that, man.  And Mr. T is another bodyguard in Chicago to become a huge star in the bodyguard competitions.  What was he in?  Everything.  Wait, was it Citizen Kane?  No.  Rocky III.  Did you look at him and think, wow, that's kind of a cool career move? 
[00:50:00]  Oh, everybody did, because with Mr. T, he set the standard for bodyguards.  He set the standard for bouncers.  Remember, they used to have the old bouncer concert.  Bouncer competitions.  Where they had to throw a midget and break through the door.  They only had it one time, but that was the first reality thing.  It was like on the Wide World of Sports or something.  Yeah, it was.  And Mr. T came out with a tuxedo, but he had the arms cut out.  Yes!  I forgot that.  He's got a tuxedo with the arms cut out.  Nobody thought of that.  And for him to be on there with a mohawk and the jewelry.  Badass.  He worked at Dingbats on the north side, and everybody went up there to Dingbats just to 
[00:50:30]  look at Mr. T.  Really?  Just to look at this unusual character.  Right.  We did bodyguard work, but nobody thought to cut the sleeves off and wear a ton of jewelry.  God was an innovator.  Yeah, we all looked the same.  We were cookie cutters, but Mr. T was this big mansion, and next thing you know, he's  gone to Hollywood.  We're like, that's T.  That's T.  So it was a big thing.  He went to Dunbar High School.  He went to school actually with my sister.  Yeah?  Yeah, and she used to talk about that he was one of the best football players to come  out of Dunbar High School in Chicago. 
[00:51:00]  Is he a big guy like you?  I've never seen him as person.  He's not as tall as me, but he's physically imposing.  Oh, yeah.  Just anything Mr. T does, I like him.  I remember when I first got to Los Angeles, I was on the bus going somewhere.  I think I was going to get some...  I had the nerve to go get aid.  I'll tell you that story, but I looked out the window, and there's Mr. T in a red Rolls-Royce  convertible.  I'm like, that's what I want to do.  Oh, man.  But I walked in this...  What are they called when you get money from the government?  Welfare.  Welfare.  I had the nerve to go get welfare, because I was hungry instead of L.A., not working, 
[00:51:30]  and I walk in this office, and everybody looks tore down.  And I'm sitting up there, and they're looking at me like, you should be playing football  somewhere.  What are you doing sitting here trying to...  I felt so bad.  I just got up and ripped my application up, and I left, because those people really needed  it.  I didn't really need it.  At that time, I was just lazy.  And seeing Mr. T on the way there.  And I said, I got to do something else, so here I am.  Nice car.  What was the first thing that got you like, wow, I think I'm getting a good foothold in 
[00:52:00]  here?  You know what?  It was being on the set of Jamie Foxx, LL Cool J, working with Martin Lawrence, being  security, and seeing how these guys were working a living single with Queen Latifah, who was  so much fun to work with.  I mean, you don't know.  I had to give her a piggyback ride every day to set.  She's like, come on, Michael, get over here.  I'm like, oh, man.  And I just, you know, you're in security, so what can you say?  No.  So I just get down on all fours, and she's like, let's go.  Come on. 
[00:52:30]  I'm like, yeah, okay.  You know, but once you get on the sets and you see that these people are so, so good at  what they do, I would just say, hey, man, get me in a scene.  He said, well, you got to get a resume.  And this guy told me, hey, put anything on your resume.  I was like, anything?  I've never done anything.  He said, what grammar school did you go to?  I said, Shakespeare, he said, put down you went to the Shakespeare School of Acting.  I said, okay.  And I put it down.  That's funny.  I put that down. 
[00:53:00]  You're not going to check?  Yeah.  He said, just put something down.  He said, did you do a play at Shakespeare?  I said, yeah.  It was fifth grade.  He said, Shakespeare School of Acting.  That sounds good to me.  So I put that down, and slowly, Jamie Foxx put me in one of the episodes, and I was so  nervous.  You know, everybody broke for lunch.  I didn't know what to do.  I sat there on the set.  The lights go, and I'm just sitting there like, is it eating lunch now?  Do I have a trailer to go to?  And it wasn't no trailer.  And I just sat there until everybody started filtering back in. 
[00:53:30]  I didn't know what to do.  So I just sat there.  But I did that.  I did Married with Children.  Did a lot of stuff.  So you ever take formal acting classes, or no?  You just...  No.  My first acting coach was Larry Moss, and he's big up here now.  He's in New York.  And if you ever...  If any actors out there really want to go into something really deep, look up Larry Moss,  because he's the one that took me to those levels in the Green Mile.  Warner Brothers hired him to work with me.  And I had just got to do an Armageddon, so I thought I was an actor. 
[00:54:00]  I mean, you can't tell me I don't know how to act.  So I walked in Larry Moss' office.  He lived in Santa Monica.  And I'm like, who's this guy?  He looks weird to me.  And I read the first couple of lines from Green Mile.  He said, hey, that's okay.  He said, you don't have it.  Oh, shit.  And I said, well, wait a minute.  I just read four lines.  He said, you just don't have it.  And I'm thinking, Armageddon's getting ready to come out in a couple of weeks.  Do you want to see what I got?  I got it.  You best yet.  I got it.  But it was two different types of movies.  Completely different types of movies and characters, too. 
[00:54:30]  I didn't understand that.  When he said, you don't have it, he didn't mean you didn't have talent.  He meant you didn't have this guy.  Just this rule right here.  As opposed to when they say that to Jimmy.  Yeah.  Which is, Jim, you don't got it.  And then you wind up here.  So what did he do for you?  He gave me another chance.  I begged him to give me another chance.  And he explained to me, this is what this guy has to be.  He has to be five years old.  You can't be this big, overpowering.  That's not this character.  So I went back and I did a little better. 
[00:55:00]  He said, okay, I can work with you.  And we worked together like four days a week.  That was the best part of the character is you just see this imposing man come in.  And he turns out to be, you know, a kitten, yeah.  But the thing was, we were going and there was this young lady coming.  She was taking Larry Moss, too.  And we would talk at the elevator.  She'd be leaving.  I'd be coming in.  And she'd say, yeah, he's a weird dude.  But he's cool.  He knows what he's doing.  And we didn't never get each other's name.  And finally, I'm at the Show West Awards show. 
[00:55:30]  And the girl says, Michael.  And I say, what's your name?  She's like, I'm Hilary Swank.  We work with Larry Moss.  It was Hilary Swank.  She was going for Boys Don't Cry, in which that year she won every award.  So Larry Moss is a legend.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Now I know who I can look up and I can blame when I don't get something.  Larry Moss.  And the show, you know, I only saw part of it because the link I had was, they gave us links.  Right.  And there was a problem with the link.  So I got, it was like the first, I think, 20 minutes.  And it's called The Finder.  Yes.  And it's a one-hour procedure. 
[00:56:00]  It is.  What's a procedural?  You know what?  That gets me, too.  No, I've never heard that term.  Procedural.  But you play, I don't want to say, is it a cop or a detective?  And it's got like a weird vibe, like John Fogerty.  It's like a 70s show almost.  Yeah.  Where they have this singer looking for one of his items as guitarist all.  And Fogerty sings a little of his own music.  I play Leo Knox, a character that Walter Sherman is good friends with.  I'm a lawyer.  I own the bar, the ends of the earth bar.  I'm his bodyguard, his confidant.  I'm his best friend.  Leo Knox came into Walter's life because at a time my family was killed and I was going 
[00:56:30]  to kill the people that murdered my family.  And Walter came into my life and stopped me from doing that.  And I used to weigh like 400 pounds.  And he got me to reading books and things like that.  So now I'm Walter's guy.  So no matter what he does, I understand him.  He has this weird gift that he can find anything.  And in one of the opening scenes, he finds John Fogerty's guitar pick.  Right.  That's all he wants.  He doesn't worry about money.  I take care of the money.  He wants the most unusual thing. 
[00:57:00]  So that's the first episode.  It's going to be really good.  And it airs Thursday.  Now when you do something like this, do you start worrying about reviews or a movie or anything?  Or do you not even care?  No, I let it go.  You have to let it go because if you start worrying about that, you're going to drive yourself  crazy.  And I have a saying that the world is won by those who let it go.  If you don't even think about it, you can't worry because it doesn't change anything.  Right.  What's going to happen Thursday and then week after that and week after that is going to  happen.  I let it go right after I bitch at the guy. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  Really?  You let it go up here too.  Exactly.  Hey, before I let it go, you son of a bitch.  Yeah, then you just let it go.  Yeah, right after I mail a Unabomber package to him, I let it go.  And it's just to promote what it's on too.  It's called The Finder and it's on tomorrow night, which is Thursday, 9 o'clock on Fox.  Yes.  And that's a great, great time slot to have.  I'm annoyed that I couldn't see the entire thing.  Jeff Stokes is The Finder and somebody, we were doing press the other day and somebody  made the mistake of saying he looked like Tom Brady. 
[00:58:00]  And I had to hear that.  Oh, no.  And I had to hear that.  He texted me, he said, just remember, I look like Tom Brady.  I'm like, don't look like Tom Brady.  He just talked to me.  But some woman said, oh, he's cute.  He looks like Tom Brady.  And I'm like, just say that.  Did you shoot this in Miami?  It looked like Miami.  A lot of Miami, a lot of LA.  Oh, okay.  A lot of both places.  That's a great life to have.  You're in like two phenomenally warm places in the middle of the winter.  Miami was just the greatest place to film.  It was really nice.  How many episodes did you guys do?  We're on episode, I'm still working.  Oh, you are? 
[00:58:30]  Okay.  Yeah, we're on episode 11 of 13.  By the way, was that not a question of somebody who just doesn't do a lot of acting work?  Oh, you mean they don't shoot it in real time?  You're an absolute idiot.  No, man.  You guys are good, man.  How are you liking TV?  I love TV.  I love TV.  It's a lot faster, though.  Yeah.  It's like a blitz.  And you're a rookie quarterback.  And the starter got hurt.  And everybody comes up to the line barking.  They're like, I'm going to get you.  I'm going to mess you up.  And I didn't understand it.  The first episode, I was always writing stuff down to try to keep up with my lines. 
[00:59:00]  But you have to study differently.  You have to allot yourself time.  Over the holidays, about four days into the holidays, they sent me the new script, Script 11.  So I started breaking my script down, and I studied over the holidays.  Because I take it seriously, and I think that's what you have to do.  When you look at a script or you look at a character like Leo in this, do you say, okay,  this is who this guy is, and kind of build a backstory?  Or do you just kind of do it as yourself?  They do the backstory, but I will take the character. 
[00:59:30]  Like Leo, in the first episode, the backdoor pilot, as we called it, to Bones, I didn't  like the way my character looked.  I didn't like the way I looked.  But I was like, I said, I'm going to change everything about this character.  This character is going to be a no-nonsense type of guy.  In the backdoor pilot, he was kind of goofy.  To me, I didn't like the way it was going, and I told Hart Hansen, who created Bones and  who created this show, I said, I'm going to take this guy in another direction.  I want him to be a badass, really. 
[01:00:00]  He doesn't smile a lot.  He has his own way of doing things.  He's very serious.  So I took it in a whole other direction.  But I think you guys will like the direction I took Leo Knox in.  So had you started shooting yet, or just from reading the script and doing the read-throughs,  you're like, oh.  No, I had done the backdoor pilot with Bones, and actually David Boreanaz and Emily DeChanel  are wonderful over there at Bones.  Oh, man.  I call them varsity.  We go on the lot.  We look at their trailers.  Ooh.  Look at their trailers. 
[01:00:30]  It's a big deal, because they've been on seven, eight years, and they've been number  one in their time slot.  And their trailers are just, like, humongous.  And then we go to our trailer, and you're just like, oh, wow.  There's nothing to work for.  There's nothing worse than watching somebody peel off to a better trailer than you're in  a honey wagon.  We go there and rub it.  We rub it.  Yeah.  We have to step up.  One day.  One day.  You ever have the ones where you get to pee in the sink?  I've had quite a few of those.  I just don't feel like...  I've had it in my early days.  Yeah, I don't feel like going up the steps.  I do that at home after some nice, you know, little... 
[01:01:00]  Well, I wish you a lot of luck with it, too, because I know it's always scary when a series  starts.  You know, you want, are people going to watch it?  Are people going to like it?  Yeah.  The networks nowadays don't give it...  Like, years ago, MASH was not doing well.  Seinfeld.  Like, a lot of these shows that turned out to be these amazing shows, they judge shows  a little bit too quickly now, I think.  They do.  They do, because there's so many out there, and there's so many things that have been  written that are just waiting to take your place.  Right, right.  You guys could be on the hot seat.  Somebody's out there waiting to, you know...  Yeah.  You just got to stay on top.  You know what I like about TV shows, though, especially ones that go a few seasons, is the character 
[01:01:30]  development that you don't get with a movie, because the movie's pretty much not done  chronologically.  Right.  Sometimes a character in the first season will be completely different...  From the second season, third season.  Second, third, yeah.  They kind of grow with the show, and that's...  I've always liked that, as opposed to movies, where you get the character at the beginning  of the movie the same as at the end.  I think, because when I looked at it, I wanted to do, like, 24.  You guys remember 24?  Sure, yeah.  I wanted to shoot people in the head. 
[01:02:00]  And they were like, Hart was like, nah, it's not that type of...  So I said, well, just let me, you know, let me shoot somebody, get some information out  of them, and just, you know, do the...  That's what I wanted to do.  And they said, nah, it's really not that type of show.  I said, well, can I just have a gun?  Can I just point and say, give me that information?  I just want to do that one time.  That's all I want to do.  She just want to be cool.  I just want to be cool like Jack Bauer was.  And I told somebody, I said, well, I went to meet the directors and the producers over  at 24.  They were thinking about casting me. 
[01:02:30]  So I said, okay, be cool, don't get excited, you know, because I can get amped up.  So I'm over there, and they're showing me CTU, and I'm like, this is cool.  And I'm like, this is where so-and-so got killed.  This is where they let the anthrax go.  And I'm like, you know, this is really cool.  And so we're getting ready to leave, and a van pulls up, and out jumps Keith or Sutherland.  Well, I'm seeing Jack Bauer.  And I'm thinking, that's a white van.  That's how they always come out.  And I rush up to him, like, hey, how you doing?  My name's Michael Clark, Doug, and I'm the eight. 
[01:03:00]  You remember when you shot Roger Cross?  Roger Cross is a friend of mine.  For 30 seconds on the inside, I'm like, Michael, dial it down, dial it down.  I couldn't.  I went through every episode, every scene.  Oh, man.  You remember when the president got shot?  I thought you were going to kill that guy.  And I'm going, and he's like, okay.  He must have been to get security.  And they never, you never saw me again.  That was it.  There's our promo up there.  Oh, there I am.  Wow, look at that.  You don't have to be here.  Yeah, you just.  Oh, yeah, I know these people. 
[01:03:30]  Hell yeah.  Yeah, that's my boy Jeff Stoltz.  The Finder.  There it is.  Tomorrow night, 9 o'clock on Fox.  At least they're going to promote it right now.  Oh, hell yeah.  So now I've gotten a lot cooler when I meet celebrities.  I don't.  Yeah.  I like the fact you're not that jaded, though.  No, no, I stay the same.  Stay the same.  I don't want to ever get, like, jaded or think I'm real cool or, you know, you don't touch me.  They have a joke on set.  They say, Michael, by season two, you'll be telling people don't look at you.  And that's why I tell them, did you eyeball me?  Out of here.  I want him out.  He just looked at me.  So that's my joke on set.  I've heard you guys are like that, too. 
[01:04:00]  There are some guys, they don't want you looking at them.  They don't want you, you know, speaking to them.  They don't want the extra, the background people.  I go and speak to all the background players because they helped me.  I did background ones.  Do you think the humble beginnings and going through a point in life where you were homeless,  that that stays with you, doesn't it?  Yeah, it stays with you.  And you never take it to where you don't think it can't happen again.  Right.  You got that constant little thing over your head going like, I remember that.  Always in the back of your mind.  I remember that.  Everything, you could lose everything in an instant.  Yeah, yeah.  So you should be kind to people regardless. 
[01:04:30]  No, but it's nice to remember where you came from.  It is.  And you come from a, it's almost like, hey, if life was fair, would I be doing this?  Right.  I don't need to philosophize for you.  That was my acting.  I'm pretending I'm him.  That's what I was saying.  You guys are nice.  You guys are cool.  Yeah, we try to be.  We've been run through the mill.  That's why.  We remember.  I got to ask some.  Yeah, go ahead.  Are we a lot of mentioned?  Who, my baby back there?  Omarosa?  Oh, man, that's my girl.  Are you guys?  That's my girl, man.  That's Omarosa from The Apprentice.  Yeah.  Oh, hi.  She's the new. 
[01:05:00]  I'm a big fucking fan.  She's the new editor of the West Coast Magazine Reality TV.  Really?  Oh, man.  So she has a lot of meetings up here.  And actually, she came in a couple of days earlier to do her press.  But yeah, she takes care of me.  If we knew she was going to be here, we'd have rigged the ceiling tile to fall or something.  Okay, watch it.  Watch it.  Do not do that.  That's my baby.  That's my girlfriend.  I hear you.  But damn it, that was hilarious.  Do you know how great it would be if he just picked you up and threw you through the window?  I just keep staring at Omarosa. 
[01:05:30]  No, she's beautiful, man.  She's beautiful.  She is gorgeous.  Beautiful on TV, but I got to say, even more beautiful in real life.  We got up this morning.  She met me here.  Just rolled out of bed, right?  It's a joy to have somebody.  That's how you look when you roll out of bed.  To have somebody that understands what you do.  Yeah.  And people get the misconception that, I mean, and I told her, I said, babe, you built up  a certain image that people can't forget easily.  It's just like nobody forgets the green mile.  That's what I'll always be known for. 
[01:06:00]  It doesn't make a difference what else I do.  Nothing wrong with that, right?  There's nothing wrong with that.  So a lot of people don't know how kind she is, how sweet she is.  She cooks for me.  Oh, man, I can't tell you what this woman has done for my life.  You're embarrassing her.  I know.  I like to do that.  She gets nervous when I start talking about her.  You should turn around because she's giving you looks like.  That's my baby, man.  I didn't see the show.  Did you come off kind of?  I did not see that show.  You didn't see Omarosa?  That was like the time when it was kind of the biggest.  Yeah.  That was the biggest season, I think, ever. 
[01:06:30]  I'm going to be wrapped up in my own loneliness.  I just didn't see it.  Oh, okay.  She didn't take anyone's shit.  Oh, you were harsh.  Oh, yeah, she was.  No, she is.  She can be that way, but she's very sweet, but very sweet.  What season was that?  God damn, it was early on.  It was, right?  Oh, you were on the first season?  I wasn't sure if it was first or second.  Yeah.  Did you like, I'll just ask you in general, were you happy with the way they edited it as a reality?  Because you hear so many people when they do something like that, they come back and they go, ah, they didn't portray me right.  They edited it wrong or they totally changed the picture.  I'd have been happier if I won.  Oh, okay. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah, well.  I'd have been a lot better at it.  Did it help you, though, right?  It helped you a lot?  Oh, absolutely.  Oh, yeah.  But you turned out all right, baby.  Yeah.  You turned out all right.  Did all right.  Look at this.  Power couple.  Yeah.  Yeah, they are.  She does.  But to date a woman who's got fame and who's beautiful, you have to kind of be on Michael's level.  You can't just, you know, a guy like me.  Can't be you.  I didn't want to say it like that.  Don't do it, Mike.  Don't worry, I will.  You can't be me in a stupid t-shirt with my fat stomach.  We're getting the wrap-up, unfortunately. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, man.  Well, I have one question that is coming in here.  Go ahead.  Big fan wants to know, in Talladega Nights, when you guys are doing the scene, don't you  put that evil on me, Ricky Bobby, how many takes?  Because it's obvious you were laughing so damn hard during that.  Ad-libbed.  Really?  Ad-libbed.  I mean, when you work with Will Ferrell, I mean, they go off on, I mean, I'm at home in  my hotel room.  I'm studying.  Okay, he says this.  I come in and I say this.  I'm thinking it's going to be like that.  They get out there and it's just whatever. 
[01:08:00]  It's just whoever says this, you just got to know when to come in.  And I'm looking at Will and I'm like, he didn't say that.  And the director's like, go ahead, go, go, go, get in there, say something.  And I'm like, hey, don't you put that evil on me.  The first time I said, I said, don't put that evil on me, Ricky Bobby.  And the director's like, cut.  He said, Michael, come here.  He said, go in on him.  He said, I want you freaking mad.  You go in on him.  You are not about to go in on him.  So I go back out there and that's what I did.  And it was one take. 
[01:08:30]  One take.  Yeah.  And you could see you guys were almost dying laughing.  Oh, the whole knife thing.  Yeah, yeah.  They were just Will Ferrell and John C.  Reilly.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And oh, man.  Sasha Baron Cohen.  You get those four together.  It's hard to do a scene and not laugh.  It's funny.  It is funny, man.  Off camera, when Will Ferrell was running around in his underwear, he did it off camera.  And he was just running.  He had these dirty underwear.  And we're like, you can't help but to laugh.  He is a funny guy.  Yeah.  He's funny in everything he does. 
[01:09:00]  Everything, man.  Even bad movies.  You know, you're not going to have all of them.  No, but I mean, it's fair enough.  No, he's funny, man.  He knows what to do.  But not every movie you're in is going to be great.  No, no, it's not.  But even the ones that are so-so, he's hilarious.  He is.  Always has been.  That's all I'm trying to say.  I'm not trying to kill the guy.  I love Will Ferrell.  Oh, he's good.  We've had John C. Reilly, and he's amazing.  Oh, funny.  He's funny.  From Chicago.  Oh, yeah.  Is he a Chicago guy?  Yeah.  I love him in Boogie Nights.  Oh, man.  Wasn't he good?  Yeah.  I love working with guys like that that just have talent.  Like you guys. 
[01:09:30]  Now, who's the most talented guy?  Oh, my God.  He's very polite of him to ask.  Now you're going to cause problems.  Obviously, that's why we're together.  Okay.  Now you're going to cause problems.  Is Howard Stern up here?  He's across the hall down the hill, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He took all the green rooms from you guys?  Yeah.  And all the green.  And all the green, yeah.  Paper green, the green room.  Who was your first?  He was here first.  We were on satellite first.  He gets the green room.  And our guests, we have the things that window washers use.  Yeah, I went in that thing right there.  We have our guests actually sit outside with the window washers.  It's time you guys stand up for yourself.  Yeah.  Yeah, come on. 
[01:10:00]  A metal chair for our guests.  What is going on?  You guys got to stand up.  You are right.  How about you stand up for us?  That would help.  I'm going to tell you how to do it.  You just call serious and say, hey, look, if this doesn't change, we're out.  We tried that.  And then we'll have a lot of time off.  That's great.  Are you going to hire us, Michael?  Once you throw that card down, you've got to play it.  Michael, remember when you were talking about rubbing the trailer?  Right.  That's exactly what it's like around here with us.  You have to go in that green room and we'll be here one day.  We go to the honey wagon.  And then the security says, hey, get away from us.  You saw our green room. 
[01:10:30]  It's our office.  I think you're sitting in my seat or aunt's seat.  Humble beginnings.  Remember that.  Humble beginnings.  We've been at this 17 years, sir.  Yeah.  This combo is 17 years.  In five years from now, each of you guys will be making $85 million.  I'm going to put it out there right now.  And when I come back, I'm going to say, wow, I remember Opie and Anthony.  Big time in now.  Maybe if you could go down the hall and breathe some flies into one of the management's mouths.  I think I'm going to tell management on the way out, you guys deserve a raise.  We're going to hire you to be our muscle.  Hey, man, do it. 
[01:11:00]  Let's do it.  This is New York.  October's coming soon, man.  We're hiring you for muscle.  This is New York.  You know how it works.  Why don't you speak for us?  Just be our agent.  It's amazing to have an agent that actually talks for you.  That would be nice.  I put my foot in my mouth in Chicago.  I went there to see the mayor of Chicago, and he was going to give me an award or something.  It was just during a teacher strike.  And I always believed that teachers should be making the $250,000 a year.  I mean, everybody here had teachers they remember, and we would not be where we are.  Well, maybe.  We got to say different type of teachers, but, you know. 
[01:11:30]  No, I agree with that teacher stuff.  It's unbelievable that they're so underpaid.  They don't get paid the money that they deserve, and I stood up and I said that in Chicago,  and the mayor just looked at me.  Oh, no.  And he was just saying, but I didn't care because it was the truth.  Right.  And I can remember all my teachers' names and their grades because they played a profound  way of the way I was raised.  And, boy, when I got back to my room, I thought I was going to get this nice plaque that said,  hey, Chicago's on.  I got a book of Chicago.  A book of Chicago.  Like, I don't know where Chicago is. 
[01:12:00]  It's like me giving you a guide to New York.  Right, right, yeah.  Yeah, this is your guide.  And you're like, so that's all I got for.  So you think he was a little upset with your, maybe that's been a big political thing.  Maybe just a little bit.  Yeah, he had probably just cut the budget for the teachers or something.  They thought you were jabbing them.  I just think teachers deserve a lot more than what they get paid, man.  Going to those classrooms with some bad kids sometimes, I couldn't do it because I'd roll  a coffin in.  Whoever cries, whoever curses, go lay in the coffin for 15 minutes.  This is going to be your life if you don't listen to me.  That's the way I do it.  Bravo. 
[01:12:30]  With that, we got to get you out of here.  The Finders, tomorrow night at 9 o'clock on Fox.  Watch it.  Yeah, we're going to check it out.  I liked what I saw of it.  I just need a better link, which, you know.  Yeah, come on, man.  Step up.  Step up.  We like this Michael Clark Duncan.  You got to come back and see us.  Anytime for you guys.  Thank you, man.  And Omarosa, what do we got?  Twitter or something?  Are you promoting anything?  Yeah, Michael's on Twitter.  Official MCD.  He's tweeting.  Listen to that voice, man.  What about your Twitter?  I'm Omarosa on Twitter.  All right, very good.  But he's official MCD.  Look at this.  She always points to me.  Is he following you on Twitter at least?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:13:00]  Okay, good.  All right.  Yes.  We do, man.  And if you just happen to want to buy Reality Weekly magazine, that would help me out a lot.  She is.  She's the West Coast editor.  She's sexy.  Oh, man.  Holy shit.  Oh, man.  You just don't.  That's another time.  Yeah.  I will save that for another time.  Sorry.  I appreciate you guys, man.  I really do, man.  Very cool, man.  We'll check out the finder tomorrow night, 9 o'clock on Fox.  Thank you, Michael.  Thank you, Michael.  Thank you, New York.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM. 
[01:13:30]  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:14:00]  You're welcome.  You're welcome.  Get in topical with the sex man.  Good morning, sexy. 
[01:14:30]  Good morning.  Excuse me while I kiss this guy.  Misheard lyrics?  Yeah.  Anyone?  I get it.  No, man.  No, man.  Why the Purple Haze today?  I'm not minding it, by the way.  Jimi Hendrix recorded this 45 years ago today.  45 years.  Really?  Wow.  Where did he record it?  Was it Seattle?  I don't know.  LA? 
[01:15:00]  I'm going to go with Columbus.  Ooh.  Yep.  He was great.  Michael Clark Duncan was really great.  Loved Michael Clark Duncan.  What an amazing voice for radio, right?  Holy shit.  I've been told I have a face for radio.  Eh?  That old gag.  I wanted to ask him, why was that mile green with envy?  Green mile. 
[01:15:30]  See?  Get it?  I don't think that would have went over very well.  He would have cracked up.  He was jealous.  Yeah.  Put me in his next movie or something.  No.  It wasn't going to happen.  I would have been Chipped Tea.  John Coffey and Chipped Tea.  We would have been beverages on a cot together.  All right.  We get it.  Oh, shit.  Blue.  Ah, yeah.  And Omarosa.  Holy fuck.  She looked really nice.  She was really sweet. 
[01:16:00]  I didn't know who she was.  She was really intense on TV.  She was, dare I say, a bitch on TV.  She is beautiful, man.  Wow.  Yeah, she's fucking beautiful.  Is she tall?  Yeah.  She's big, right?  Because he needs a...  Not big.  Tall.  No, no, no.  I don't mean fat.  She's beautiful.  I mean, just, she's a tall girl.  Yeah, she is.  Wow.  What a...  I thought she...  I didn't recognize...  I thought she was a publicist.  I'm like, what a knockout.  No, then she was on Get Me the Hell Out of Here, right?  Or one of those other ones.  One of the spin...  What?  Yeah, she was on... 
[01:16:30]  She was on a few.  She was on...  She was on The Apprentice.  And she was also on Celebrity Apprentice.  Because then she was a celebrity.  Right.  And then...  But wasn't she on, like...  I'm a celebrity Get Me the Hell Out of Here or something like that?  Yeah, one of those shows.  Yeah.  Yeah, she's been around, man.  I think she was on one of those VH1 shows.  The Surreal Life shows.  Oh, maybe that's what it was.  Oh, right.  She was on one of those.  Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, she knows a little bit about reality shows.  Look at the boobies in that picture.  Holy shit.  Oh, my.  What's going on there?  God.  Look at the boobies.  Looks like an ass on her chest. 
[01:17:00]  Wow.  She's beautiful.  Yeah.  Pretty smile.  But you gotta be a guy like him.  Like a big, secure guy.  Oh.  To handle a hot, tall chick like that.  You have to.  Yeah?  Yeah, I would get ruined and humiliated.  Gotta have that voice.  Yeah.  That deep voice.  Was he taller than you, Kenny?  Yeah, he was...  I didn't notice.  Why didn't you notice?  I don't know. 
[01:17:30]  I was busy doing my security duties.  What's wrong with him?  But he might have been the threat.  That's not nice to say.  What is he doing?  I think he is bigger than Kenny, though.  You think he's taller?  Yeah, I think he was like 6'5".  Kenny's about 6'5".  Kenny is 6'1 if he's pushing.  I'm 5'11".  I'm a molested tall chick.  Hey, we missed a story yesterday.  Corey Feldman.  Remember Corey?  Is he still hurting? 
[01:18:00]  Hurting.  There was a lot of hurting going on after Michael Jackson died.  Yeah.  He's going to write a book.  And he's teasing it already by saying that in the book,  he's going to name two celebrities that molested him.  I think I know who they are.  I think I know who they are.  The odds on favorite has to be Michael Jackson.  No, no.  That's the big surprise.  He's denied that in the past.  It's not Michael Jackson.  Maybe it's time to admit it.  Nope.  It was Rock Hudson and Magic Johnson.  Ow. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  Write out your will.  I will say Chunk from Goonies.  What?  They're the same age.  What?  Weren't they the same age at the time?  They're thinking of sloth.  No.  I'm thinking of little fat kid.  Oh, they're the same age.  Oh, E-Rock.  So?  Sorry.  He didn't say an age.  You can't be molested if the person's the same age as you.  Yeah.  Sure you can.  I don't think so.  That's the rules.  Let's see.  Who else could it be?  Was it the guy that owned the gizmo? 
[01:19:00]  Very good.  I'm just trying to think of any movie Corey Feldman was in.  Whatever.  Kiefer.  The other Corey?  Kiefer Sutherland.  All right.  Lost Boys.  He molested Corey Feldman, you're saying?  Yeah.  Possibility.  Enjoy that lawsuit, sir.  Enjoy that lawsuit.  I'm allowed to say possibility.  Anthony.  You say possibility, sure.  Yasser.  We've been holding on to something for a while before our next guest went to the studio.  That's right.  Big dicks.  We got that Hoarders episode that you fucking love.  It's typical Hoarders.  You're saying worst one ever, Sherry. 
[01:19:30]  Worst bitch ever.  Ever.  You want to play this today?  Yeah, let's get a few sound bites off of this pig.  Let's keep in mind, though, that there are people who are suffering.  Oh, right.  It's the new Improved Jim Norton.  I hate it.  You know, let's just keep in mind, though, that these are people who are not in control.  Yeah.  And we're in control, so we should feel fortunate.  Ever, Sherry?  Worst bitch ever.  Ever.  You want to play this today?  Yeah, let's get a few sound bites off of this pig.  Let's keep in mind, though, that there are people who are suffering. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, right.  It's the new Improved Jim Norton.  I hate it.  You know, let's just keep in mind, though, that these are people who are not in control.  Yeah.  And we're in control, so we should feel fortunate.  We should.  Greg?  Sherry.  We talked about Sherry a little bit.  Yeah.  I love her.  Sherry's daughter, Allie, and her husband show the kitchen.  Sure.  Yeah, they show the kitchen.  Now, this is the competition.  I thought you were Team Robin Zazio.  I am, but, you know, when I saw, this is hoarding buried alive, as opposed to hoarders. 
[01:20:30]  Right.  But when I saw the trailer for this one, I was like, I got to see it.  It was disgusting.  And this woman is so despicable, could be the most hateable hoarder ever put on television.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They've had some...  Oh, I know.  That just goes to show you how hateable this fucking slovenly piece of shite...  Well, Allie and her husband show the kitchen, of course, of Sherry. 
[01:21:00]  Sherry's kitchen.  Here we go.  We live with roaches, and we have trash all over the place.  It's not a good place to be.  Why is she living with her mom if she's married?  Well...  How sucky is her life?  Here's the problem.  That she's living with her mom, who's a hoarder.  See, here's the problem.  The father lives elsewhere.  And the father wants the kids to live in a better environment.  Oh, Allie's not married to the husband part here? 
[01:21:30]  Well, the daughter.  Yeah, the her...  No, but how it's written, daughter Allie and her husband.  The pronoun refers to Sherry.  Right.  Daughter, daughter Allie and her husband.  I thought Allie was married and still living with her mom, Sherry.  Oh, no, no.  Allie's the daughter.  You could see that, how it's written, sir.  And because she gets money, because she's on disability, she gets money for having the  kids in the house.  If the kids left, she wouldn't get as much money.  So she forces them to live in a roach and shit, human shit infested house. 
[01:22:00]  So Sherry's husband lives somewhere else, because he has decided, fuck this.  Okay, now he comes back in the house with his daughter Allie, who's still living with  the hoarder, to show the kitchen.  Yeah.  Got it.  Hopefully there's some help arriving fast for this woman.  She's obviously suffering.  She's in a lot of pain.  Oh, boy.  And I hope it helped her on.  Me!  Well, you know what, Anne?  It's real easy to sit here and poke fun and throw jabs at those who are suffering. 
[01:22:30]  That's why we do it.  But she has fibromyalgia.  God bless her.  Fibromyalgia.  Go ahead, hon.  I'm enjoying Jimmy's new angle.  Yeah.  I just want to go on record and say that.  Yeah.  But something will happen in one of these clips where he loses his fucking mind and turns  it right around to the me, me, me thing, which we all love from Jim Norton.  I think me, me, me, I think implies that we don't understand how she's hurting.  All right.  Well, let's see.  And she's doing the best she can, Greg.  Let's see how this develops.  47-year-old Sherry and her husband, Mark, moved into this 3,000-square-foot North Carolina 
[01:23:00]  home about six years ago, along with their two children.  But since then, Sherry's gone on disability, and most of the day-to-day responsibilities  around the house have fallen to 17-year-old Allie and her younger brother, David.  I can't do a gourmet meal.  Obviously, no counter space.  Most of the stuff I cook, I don't have a trash can to put it in, so I have, like, boxes and  stuff all over the place.  They just throw the garbage on the floor.  Spaghetti cans. 
[01:23:30]  The oven doesn't work.  I have one burner.  This is the daughter.  We have an operational microwave.  As long as you don't mind the bugs running out of it.  Yeah.  Does the fan still work?  All that you're hearing in the background is them walking on top of...  The fridge doesn't work.  ...the refrigerator don't work in here.  Yeah.  You need a hazmat suit if you're going to open it.  Everything they opened, roaches came flying out of it. 
[01:24:00]  Listen to the garbage.  This is a dishwasher that doesn't work.  Did you wash this?  I haven't even got any dishes in it.  No.  It's got bugs.  Yeah.  Sounds to me like instead of sitting there hemming and hawing, they ought to be helping  this poor woman out.  You know, I hear that daughter in there.  She's stepping in garbage.  How about you do a little picking up?  Yeah.  The mother is sitting in the other room in her fat woman chair.  Hey, hey, come on.  If she's hurting, she's in her big, fat pig woman chair, surrounded, literally surrounded 
[01:24:30]  by two feet, at least two feet, some four feet of garbage.  No fault of her own.  She's trying to just make things happen and make ends meet.  And this lazy daughter is not helping out.  Well, the daughter is very busy cooking in a kitchen that is completely unusable.  Can I have a little bit of an observation?  Sure.  Once again, enjoying Jimmy's take on this whole thing.  Absolutely.  But when that clip was playing, he started biting his own teeth.  It is impossible. 
[01:25:00]  Unfortunately, you can't see that.  Well, I was upset that that daughter is not helping that poor woman out.  She's sitting there with her fibromyalgia.  Very real condition.  Look on your face said differently, sir.  Just awful.  Nah, she's just sitting there waiting for her food.  And I can't wait for Jimmy to snap.  This daughter's just lackadaisically.  That was stepping on garbage.  Lackadaisically.  She had no choice.  That was the setup clip.  We find out when Sherry's house started to go to shit.  Once her childhood home, Sherry moved back in with her family to help care for her aging 
[01:25:30]  mother.  But soon after, her mother felt drastically ill.  Why does a sick mom make you lose your mind?  What a dear.  It happens all the time.  See, that's what happens when a daughter cares.  She moves in to help mother.  I don't know what happened with Miss Step on the garbage, but apparently she doesn't come  from the same school.  And two days after us moving in and spending the first night there, my mom collapsed and  hit the floor.  When my grandmother passed away, my mom just sort of came to a room and hid under a cover 
[01:26:00]  grave for a year and a half.  And during that time, things started to accumulate.  Sure.  And by then, it was too far gone for any one person to fix it.  And it just started building up.  The funeral dirge music.  And when it got to where I couldn't get in the bedroom, I decided that I wasn't going  to move room to room.  I was just going to move out.  Well, that's the way to abandon someone who needs help. 
[01:26:30]  When I left out, it started getting a lot worse.  And it got to the point where it is.  And it's really, really bad.  Yeah, it's really, really bad.  Yeah, yeah, that's nice.  Poor mother passes away.  She moves in there like a deer to help out.  And what does he do?  He hightails it out.  When the going gets tough, the tough get going.  Oh, thank God he left this fucking monster.  Have we heard Sherry yet?  No, no.  She's probably trying to get things cleaned up around the house.  No, that lazy fuck is sitting.  She just sits and does nothing.  She's got fibromyalgia, buddy. 
[01:27:00]  Complaining about her fibromyalgia and her seven other disabilities that she's getting.  She's about to talk about all her disabilities.  I've got to ask Ann one thing.  Is she a big woman or does she have big boobies?  She's a fat slob with giant sloppy fat slob.  She's a healthy gal.  But she's resting her own arms on her boobs.  Yeah, that's what she does.  She sits amongst her trash.  Maybe if she had some help around that house, things would be a little bit different.  Her trash that's more important than her children and her family.  Poor woman passed away. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  Fell down, hit her little head on the sink or whatever it was on the way down.  Garbage just piled up.  No one to help.  Sherry talks about it.  Right, Sam?  That's right.  Of course.  The disabilities and the kids not helping her.  Oh, right.  The kids are not helping.  This might get Jimmy back.  By the way, when she says she has disabilities and fibromyalgia, she's sitting in this chair  not doing anything.  And that's her excuse for not doing anything.  That's right, yeah.  But the second someone pisses her off, she bolts out of the chair and walks right away  out of the house and to her vehicle so she doesn't have to listen to people criticizing 
[01:28:00]  her.  So she obviously is, you know, low-comotive.  So you can move when she has to.  Yeah.  Let's show you how unhealthy this show is.  Take sick people and it pushes them to get out of their comfort zone.  Sick woman, she should just be sitting in that chair relaxing instead of running around  the house trying to gain some relief.  Here's Sherry.  That's this terrible show.  This room is full of trash.  It pretty much looks like a trash bin all by itself.  Kids decided to quit taking it out.  And so everything just kind of gets thrown in that corner.  And, um, not me. 
[01:28:30]  No, Sherry.  That ain't their trash.  They won't take any trash out.  And I can't.  I'm not physically able to.  That's right.  Sherry, yes, you are physically able to.  I have 13 disabilities.  13.  The worst being, I guess, fibromyalgia because it kind of affects my whole body.  Yes, poor girl.  What is that one?  The worst.  What is that one?  That's another made-up fucking lazy disease.  What is it?  It's called lazy disease.  What is it, though?  Oh, my joints hurt. 
[01:29:00]  Oh, it's the joint thing?  I have some kind of pain.  Some kind of pain that no doctor can really diagnose.  It's like Epstein-Barr's syndrome.  Well, how about she hydrates herself?  Yeah.  And how about that?  She might be down on her watering page.  Do some fucking tonnage, you fat slob.  Hey, how about that husband helps her out instead of just sitting there going, no, Sherry, no.  How about how can I help, Sherry?  What can I do for you, Sherry?  Oh, God.  We need more people like the fucking husband.  That's how you handle this shit.  What, non-helpers?  That's how you handle this shit.  She has a bone problem.  Lazy bones.  That's what she has. 
[01:29:30]  Poor Sherry just wants to live a healthy, happy life, and that daughter won't take the trash  out.  Who hasn't been around someone like that?  Take the trash out.  Throw her in one of those fucking got-trash trucks.  It's a nice attitude.  Got junk.  Greg, hit play.  The worst being, I guess, fine-brain myalgia, because it kind of affects my whole body.  My mom uses her disabilities occasionally to get out of things.  Every time we got motivated to try and clean the house, she'd have a headache.  Her back would be hurting.  She'd have to go lay down. 
[01:30:00]  And I didn't want to clean without her because I don't know what to throw out.  Sherry, I've heard all I'm going to listen to about your doctors.  I've seen you go shopping.  I've seen you go on vacation.  The doctors tell you to get out of that chair.  You say you can't.  You don't know what you're talking about.  All right.  Oh, God.  That's the way to-  Stay in that chair.  That's the way to talk to someone who's sick. 
[01:30:30]  Just bully them.  Bully them.  Doctors don't lie, bucko.  That's what happens.  She's sick.  She's a lying sack of lazy shit.  Lazy shit.  She will not fucking lift a finger.  She'd rather sit in garbage.  She uses one of those extender things that you usually use to grip cans that are a little  too high up on the shelf.  She has one near her filthy, smelly ass chair and just tosses garbage aside with this fucking  claw.  Well, thanks to that daughter and lazy husband that don't want to help out. 
[01:31:00]  She has to do that.  She's been forced to do that by circumstance.  So why doesn't she use the claw to put it in the fucking garbage pail?  Because there is no garbage in the room.  There's no garbage in any of the rooms.  And they're all lazy pigs who say, well, I had a garbage pail and this one didn't like  it.  So I had to get rid of it in a pile of garbage in the room.  They all have excuses as to why they're living with cockroaches everywhere.  And Sherry's daughter talks about being in charge and makes Sherry breakfast.  Yes, yes, yes. 
[01:31:30]  How old is Sherry?  I don't know.  She's, what, high school?  Something like that.  So she could leave the fucking house, right?  The daughter's 17.  She's waiting until she's 18.  She's waiting until she's 18.  So she's almost there.  Good for her.  A little lazy.  How about you clean up the house instead of, you know, futching around with your friends?  She's stomping on garbage, making eggs for her mother in this next clip.  And the whole time she's flicking cockroaches away like it's a mission.  You're having fun.  No, it's not very much fun if you watch the actual video, Jim. 
[01:32:00]  Quit futzing around in there and running around with your friends.  And how about you make some healthy eggs for mom?  No.  And the daughter was walking around in bare feet.  Bare feet.  Yeah, of course you were too lazy.  Why are you doing that?  Because she's an idiot.  Poor Sherry.  The whole family is full of idiots and lazy pigs.  This poor woman.  She's a slob.  I kind of feel like I'm the staple.  I take care of the family.  She doesn't.  So someone has to.  Daughter talking.  Allie.  Allie.  You can hear the fat.  I mean, I need my booties. 
[01:32:30]  I need your booties.  Put them on.  Put on her boots.  It's difficult, but it's how I'm, I feel like I have to live.  What's that noise?  Right now, um, Allie cooks because I can't get in the kitchen.  Oh, poor dear.  Do we still have grits?  Are you going to make the egg sandwiches for breakfast?  We're going to have leftovers for breakfast.  No. 
[01:33:00]  Yes.  I need either grits or egg sandwich.  Oh, my God.  Do you see right there?  Oh, my God.  I feel this gritting his teeth.  I feel the same way.  The nerve of her to want to give leftovers to that woman with fibromyalgia.  Oh, my God.  How dare her?  She's gritting his teeth.  Leftovers.  That's what this mother gets after all of her hard work?  Nothing is good enough, right?  This pig.  Nothing is good enough, right?  And she has never done one wrong thing in her entire life.  Attaboy.  The situation this woman is in is directly caused by everyone else. 
[01:33:30]  Yes.  Not one thing she fucking did put her in this position.  That's the first thing you've said right, pal.  This poor woman is just trying to come home and take care of her mother, and this daughter's  futzing around with her friends.  Oh, God.  I think Knuckle Stump from Twitter speaks for a lot of people today.  Good Will Jimmy needs to be buried in a pile of hoarder excrement.  Good Will Jimmy.  Good Will Jimmy.  You know what?  You can keep running around with all the laugh tracks and the negativity, but I think this 
[01:34:00]  poor woman, her joints are aching.  What is she supposed to do?  What are her sore joints while that lazy daughter gallivants?  So the daughter's flicking cockroaches so she can make breakfast for her fucking lazy piece  of shit and mother, and the food she's cooking isn't good enough?  Yeah, it's not good enough.  Because she decided to go with the fucking leftovers?  She don't want leftovers.  She wants grits or an egg sandwich, right?  Yeah.  What do you got?  You got the grits?  You got the egg sandwich?  I don't know.  Just so you could hear the fat resonance in her voice. 
[01:34:30]  And the problem is, I understand 17, you still have to deal with that bullshit.  That's it.  Because you would love to say the daughters should be out of that situation, but...  The fat pig mother, she's diabetic, and she injects insulin, and she had a sharps box  at one point, but she don't know where it went, so now she just throws the syringes in  various piles of garbage around the house.  So the syringes?  There are open fucking syringes laying all over the house. 
[01:35:00]  They found something like, when they cleaned up, it was how many?  A hundred?  Over two hundred.  Over two hundred syringes thrown about the house.  Poor girl.  They had to get a biohazard crew in there.  She's actually diabetic.  She's got to take care of herself.  No one's helping her.  The fucking selfish pig won't even clean up her fucking syringes and maybe keep her kids  safe from poking themselves at a needle.  Where's the shoes?  The kid's got shoes.  She just chooses not to put them on.  She's too busy laughing and having fun with her friends. 
[01:35:30]  She's making garbage wine.  Got a good question coming in from Queen Elizabeth.  Oh.  As a father, would you leave your child there with this animal?  No!  There's a custody.  There's custody shit.  Sure.  They won't give the father custody for some reason.  That's crazy.  Who's on that case?  I don't know either.  Well, he's Mr. Get Outta Dodge.  Go and get stuff.  The tough kid going.  Yeah.  What's wrong with his house?  I don't know.  That they decided that it's better for the kid to be in this house.  The mother's fighting and fighting because she wants the money that the kids bring in. 
[01:36:00]  Well, she needs someone to enable her.  She needs someone to dump fucking five jerry cans full of kerosene in that house and light a flare.  Torch this place!  Torch this place!  Damn it.  What movie?  I'm not sure.  Platoon.  I'm going to go with Platoon.  He already said that.  What?  He said it.  When?  I don't know what the fuck you're talking about!  Platoon.  Elias! 
[01:36:30]  You too?  You did right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Egg sandwich.  Stubborn.  Oh.  Just rotting on garbage.  How many eggs do you want, Mom?  Thirty.  I want three eggs, Allie.  When I'm cooking in the kitchen, I really have to protect the food.  Usually it looks like I'm playing whack-a-mole, but I'm not.  I'm actually squishing bugs and smacking them away from the pot, trying not to.  She is trying- I mean, believe me, it's not like, oh, here comes a bug. 
[01:37:00]  They are mounting an invasion.  A Normandy beach-style invasion on the eggs.  I don't get it.  I don't either.  Why is the kid in this house?  Exactly.  Who the fuck was in charge of this?  Exactly.  Who's supposed to help Sherry?  What the fuck?  Thank you.  What is she supposed to do to herself?  She's sick.  The worst woman.  The worst woman.  But this show should have went to the husband's house, did they?  Just to see how his house is?  Oh, Mr. Get Out of Town, when the gun gets tough, the gun gets tough. 
[01:37:30]  What the gun?  Mr. Run for the Hills?  Jimmy.  What the fuck?  Jimmy.  It's-  It's-  It's-  But why didn't they go into that?  Why-  Dude, I don't know-  What's wrong with that guy?  Because-  Is he a kid toucher?  What is he doing?  Because it's more infuriating to watch like this.  Is he hoarding kids in his basement?  I was so angry watching this fucking show.  For him to abandon this woman, I don't blame you, buddy.  Oh, boy.  I'm right with you.  No, you're getting the point wrong, Jimmy.  Jimmy is getting-  Well, I don't want to ruin his bit, but when the clips are playing, Jimmy's not happy. 
[01:38:00]  I just can't believe the way they're treating this lady.  This lady deserves-  Well, she wants eggs.  All of a sudden, she's going to beg for eggs in her own castle?  What is that?  Lazy Alley running around with her bare feet.  How about you clean up the place?  Poor woman.  Her jerts are all sore.  Holy fuck, dude.  Holy fuck.  Absolutely.  What a terrible support system this poor lady has.  Only one daughter?  One kid?  Yeah.  Unfortunately.  Two kids.  Two kids?  Where's the other kid?  She's got a younger brother that-  Or a younger son.  That had like a broken foot or something.  Yeah, he's in a brace. 
[01:38:30]  Sleeping on a bed full of roaches and garbage.  What did he do?  He twisted his ankle and walked into the house?  Maybe he poked himself at a fucking sharp.  And there's roaches in his bed?  Roaches in everyone's bed.  Ew.  He was younger.  Yeah, there's roaches on people's beds.  Oh, what happened, Jimmy?  I heard an-  Ew.  It's disgusting.  And that fat woman's pillow, I swear, it looked like it had shit smeared on it.  What's that from?  Or dried period blood.  Well, in the bathroom, there's maxi pads all over.  Or bloody maxi pads and shit, with toilet paper and shit thrown in the bathtub. 
[01:39:00]  You know why our pillow's brown, right?  Why?  You know, we all roll over at night.  She's probably rolling over and just squashing cockroaches.  Oh, it probably is.  You know, it probably is just cockroach juice.  I wouldn't even doubt that.  That's a viable explanation.  Do we have any pictures of that?  We don't have that on video, right?  I don't know what they put up on the site.  Oh, what happened to Good Will Jimmy?  What do you-  The fact that they let this poor woman sleep like that is a sin. 
[01:39:30]  It's a sin, Greg.  We're losing Good Will Jimmy, I'm telling you.  He's not going to be able to help himself.  No, no, no.  This poor woman has to live in a roachy bed?  Jimmy's going to lose his mind.  I bet your Mr. High on the Hog ex-husband is living pretty good.  You try to stay strong, Jimmy.  Look at that poor-  God bless her.  Stay strong, Good Will Jimmy, because you're going to lose your shit.  No, no, no, no.  I don't turn on-  When the going gets tough, I don't get going.  I just want to know what it's going to be.  What is she drinking, the poor sweetie?  Some Pepsi, I hope.  Yeah, some Diet Pepsi.  All right, girl.  Fishing bugs and smacking them away from the pot, trying not to get them in the food. 
[01:40:00]  I know that's a health hazard.  I've gotten used to it.  I realize I ignore the roaches.  I just pretend they're not there.  I block it all out.  Jesus.  That's-  How about you clean them up instead of blocking it out and fussing around?  Wow.  How many roaches?  Millions.  No.  Literally millions of roaches.  To the point where the exterminators went in the house and said, not only can we not  do anything, but we can't be in this house anymore, because after 10 minutes, they were 
[01:40:30]  worried about the toxicity of the air in the house.  It's-  There were-  But she's still alive.  They were everywhere.  You couldn't even show-  They couldn't even show all the roaches.  What does a roach smell like?  I don't know.  Wine smells like nothing.  The amount in this house, there was roach shit everywhere.  You could see piles of roach shit.  But what does it smell like?  I guess like roach shit.  That you know roaches are in there.  Like some type of-  If you didn't see them, obviously.  Like just, I guess, some type of-  Weird insect smell.  Organism breaking down. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  Probably like when you open up mealworms, when you go to feed them to a lizard, and it's  that earthy-  What do you mean?  When you feed them to us?  Buggy smell.  We're the lizards.  Yeah, lizards.  That's right.  You liked his little tongue, Jimmy?  I love those shitheads.  Oh, shitheads.  Hurgle, durgle, durgle.  We're getting word that he's like a musician, songwriter, and he had a rap video out.  But anyway, back to Sherry.  Clip number five.  Sherry's neighbor comes over and talks to Sherry about the trash. 
[01:41:30]  Why do you have so many empty cans and canisters and things on the floor?  Yeah.  Well, they're empty and they're on the floor.  However, Allie can't throw them away in the trash can because David hasn't taken it out  since November.  Not me.  Excuse.  Excuse.  It wasn't my idea.  Why is there shit all over the place?  You're completely mobile.  This woman can move.  She can pick up cans.  She can do it.  Why aren't you fucking cleaning the house? 
[01:42:00]  What a surprise.  The first thing she says, why are they cans all over?  The first word out of her mouth was her daughter's name.  Well-  With the excuse going.  And David, too.  David hasn't taken the trash out.  What is this woman supposed to do when she's sick in bed?  How old's David?  An adult.  David, my David, with the garbage.  Well, maybe he's the bad son.  How old's David?  15 or so, probably.  14, 15.  David, my David.  So what does she do?  She has five-year-old my elder.  But what does she do to help the situation?  Nothing.  Because so far, it's everyone else's fault.  What is she doing, Sam? 
[01:42:30]  When she sits on the chair, like when she wakes up in the morning, she goes and she sits on  her chair.  And to the right-  That's a good advertisement for Pepsi, by the way.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure Pepsi loved this.  For the right, she has a half-drinking two-liter bottle of Diet Pepsi that she just opens up  and starts drinking again.  And then to the left is the pile of Diet Pepsi cans and bottles that she just throws  them when she's finished.  I want to see the cockroaches.  This is where they go into the bathroom at one point, and the guy just goes, I can't  go in there.  And then there's a door to this other room that hasn't been opened, and he tries to open 
[01:43:00]  it, and when he opens it, a crack, roaches come literally pouring out of this room.  I gotta see that clip.  I'm getting, I swear, I have goosebumps right now.  I'm watching this.  We're looking at a clip online, and there are roaches-  Everywhere.  All over the kitchen.  That's an ant.  Hey, rats.  I'd welcome you, yeah.  Yes, rats, mice.  There is a can full of roaches.  The roaches, he puts a stick in there and measures it. 
[01:43:30]  It's a good three inches of roaches in that can.  Right, the daughter could be doing something.  What is she doing?  She's running around having parties.  Parties?  She's cooking eggs for her slovenly, fat pig, lazy mother.  After having been begged to do something.  Oh, damn it!  Where do they keep the leftovers?  Oh, I can't even look at that.  I swear, I got goosebumps.  Where do they keep the leftovers?  They probably do.  I bet you they have them in a bag on the counter.  Because they don't open the fridge.  All right, let's keep going here.  And she won't take it out.  And the bugs are just running. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  So you can't get trash bags and do it?  I've tried.  Put things in there.  And I can't.  She claims that she can't do anything.  I think that she can if she tried a little bit more.  She's always blaming it on the children.  Yep, that's all she does is blame the kids for her own fucking slovenly laziness.  There are hoarders.  And you watch the show Hoarders.  You see their houses clutter. 
[01:44:30]  It's like things that they want to keep and stuff.  This was that whole other thing where it's not a hoarder.  It's a fucking slob.  It's a disgusting slob.  It's garbage.  By the way.  By the way.  You brought this to the show saying worst ever.  So far, it's just within range of every other one that I've seen or heard.  I think you have to take it in the context of the entire show to see this woman and see her complete denial and lack of any responsibility.  It's a denial that gets you? 
[01:45:00]  Anger at anybody else.  Even the people that are trying to help her.  The anger she holds towards these people makes you literally want to see her beheaded, torched with gasoline.  She is a horrible person.  How about getting this woman some help?  That's what I say.  How about getting her daughter who's not lazy and too busy jumping jacks and futzing around the house while mother's got her fibromyalgia.  The poor deer is just trying to relax. 
[01:45:30]  Fibromyalgia.  How about somebody helps?  Someone tweeted and said they moved a picture on the wall and hundreds of roaches go scattering.  Behind the picture.  They were hiding back there.  That's nice.  Lazy family.  We know what she needs and no one's helping her.  Is that it?  Goodwill Jimmy.  He tried.  I was like, oh boy.  Wait.  He slipped a little bit there.  No.  She's got a lazy family.  Here's Sherry talking about the syringes being all over the floor.  God bless her.  Right.  I have diabetes, which I have to live on a schedule.  Because if I don't, I die. 
[01:46:00]  You can feel sorry for yourself.  I hope you don't.  And I had a sharps container that I kept everything in.  And I don't know what happened to it and the clutter.  So I put the syringes after I've used them into the trash pile.  Right.  The health department would flip out if I saw that.  Why wouldn't she put the syringes, even if you lost your sharps container, you have so much shit and junk and tin cans around. 
[01:46:30]  Put them in that just so they're not laying on the floor.  She literally throws them in the piles of garbage.  So it is the, figuratively speaking, well, it's literally speaking, the needle in a haystack.  Now, you watch enough of these shows.  What's the difference between her being just a big, fat, disgusting slob and a hoarder?  That's just it.  I don't think she's as much a hoarder as we've seen on these shows.  She's a fucking pig, slob, lazy mess. 
[01:47:00]  A lot of the hoarders are, you know, they can't throw their possessions away.  This is just garbage for the most part, right?  Yeah, yeah.  It's garbage.  It's trash.  It's bugs.  It's shit.  It's human excrement.  I'll tell you the difference.  This poor woman has no support system.  They could wait.  What?  Come on.  It's funny.  It's terrible.  Sherry gets upset at, oh, no, let's go with, Sherry talks about, well, we did the syringes, 
[01:47:30]  I guess.  Yeah.  Sherry gets upset at the therapist.  Okay.  So now the therapist is on board.  Yeah.  The therapist.  And now Sherry gets upset.  Of course she does.  And then the therapist has to deal with that.  Because maybe the therapist is trying to tell her that she might have some responsibility  in all this.  Yeah.  Therapist is a bully.  A bully.  So, Sherry, let me ask you.  Do you think you are a hoarder?  No, not really.  So, if you don't have a problem with hoarding, what do you think is going on? 
[01:48:00]  I think that my kids should be taking responsibility for anything.  She's right.  She's saying, see, you don't like when the facts come out, do you?  You know, my 17-year-old and then the younger one, which I think was 14 or 15, whatever  it is, the son.  Yeah.  The 17-year-old and the 14-year-old aren't taking responsibility for the wreck that that  fucking house is in because the mother decides she's just going to sit on her ass and complain 
[01:48:30]  about her 17 disabilities when she can obviously get up and move around and move things.  That's nice.  I got a great question coming in for Anthony Cumia.  All right.  From three underscore days on Twitter.  Does it change Ant's opinion at all to know Sherry's a registered Republican?  Who gives a shit?  What the fuck is that?  She's a registered cunt.  That's nice talk for the woman who's got fibromyalgia.  Oh, God.  Fibromyalgia.  You're just like that therapist, you know better.  Just bullying.  Bullying.  Poor girl.  Disability for anything. 
[01:49:00]  This is your house.  And this is your responsibility.  Do you think if you were more willing to do some of this, they might also be willing  to help?  Good question.  They don't want to help me do it.  They don't.  They want me to do it by myself.  They tell me we're not doing it.  My kids don't want me anywhere near them.  That's right.  Do you understand that?  Yeah, they hate me.  I get that.  I get that my husband doesn't want to be around me. 
[01:49:30]  I get that nobody wants to be around me.  Boo hoo.  And right now, the way that you're making me feel, I don't want you here.  I think that Sherry has a problem seeing herself as anything other than a victim in any  given situation.  She is a victim.  She is a victim.  The victim.  Me.  That's what it is.  It's the old Jimmy.  Me.  Oh, it's easy to throw that word around.  But how about when she asks for some darn help around the house and those kids are too 
[01:50:00]  busy bouncing balls and doing what they do?  No, they're cooking her fucking breakfast, lunch, and dinner constantly because she's  a pig.  Oh, and she did say sandwiches.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not sandwich.  You know, make me a sandwich.  They don't want to help.  Meanwhile, the mother is making no showing.  She should be the one that goes, come on now.  You're the kids here.  I'm the adult.  Here's how we fucking clean up and get that ball a rolling.  Fair enough. 
[01:50:30]  Uh, the cleaning crew tells Sherry they need to bring in a hazmat team.  Of course.  With her insect problem growing worse by the day and the county health inspectors threatening  to condemn her home, Sherry has finally agreed to a massive haul away.  Professional organizer Marsha Steyer is on hand to help the family.  But the moment she sees what's on the floor, the plans change.  I have a little bit of concern with the sanitary napkins and the needles and the feces. 
[01:51:00]  It's real important that my team doesn't get stuck by one of the needles.  So I may have to have a hazmat team come in.  Your safety is really important to me, too.  And so is your children.  But I have to look out for the team, too.  I just don't like how they talk to these people.  You hear that list of things she said?  Like, it was just normal, like, you know, we're a little concerned about the syringes,  the dirty, the dirty, the dirty champons and your shit.  Right.  How about a little compassion?  How about talking to a person who's been mistreated properly? 
[01:51:30]  Oh, please, Jimmy.  They're talking to her too harshly.  Holy shit.  How does she take it?  She should get up and walk away.  By the way.  Why the kid gloves?  Again, she gives him, she gives a kid gloves and this woman just takes it and walks away.  Oh, I know.  She gets mad.  Why can't you say the same thing horrified?  Like, holy shit.  Do you understand what you've put in your house?  Right.  And have your children living in?  Right, right.  Oh, God.  So far in Sherry's house, we've found close to 200 needles now. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah.  Right.  And we aren't even finished yet.  Okay.  There's some baskets that are nice that I'd like to get rid of them just because they're  infested with bugs.  Are you okay with that?  Sure.  My mother can come out of her grave and make more.  Oh, your mom made this one?  Let's just throw it away.  Is it?  Okay.  I'm sorry.  Throw it away.  If you cared about your mother's basket that she made, why would it be infested with fucking 
[01:52:30]  bugs and covered with shit?  Thank you, Anthony.  And that's what that stupid therapist should be saying.  Yes.  Stop with the kid gloves shit.  Like, oh, I'm the asshole for throwing it away?  You're going to bring up the fact that your mother's going to come out of the grave and  make me another one?  That's right.  How about you take care of the one she made for you?  I understand your sarcasm.  With love.  How about the one that's here that you let just go to shit?  How about those lazy kids brush the bugs off it?  How about that?  All right, Jimmy.  Look.  How about those lazy kids?  We get it.  I've had it with you.  We get it.  How about those lazy kids? 
[01:53:00]  We get it.  Goodwill, Jimmy.  We get it.  Carrying around a basket of bugs and laughing with their friends and futzing around.  How about they brush the bugs off?  Futsing.  No one's futzing.  She is a fucking slob.  Yeah, yeah.  We got to get them in here.  They've waited long enough.  They've waited long enough.  Quite literally.  Sherry has to lay down while the crew cleans her house.  Sherry?  Back here.  Sherry? 
[01:53:30]  Uh-huh.  What you doing?  I'm laying down and propping my foot up and cooling off before I puke.  To have a homeowner just go to bed and not be a part of the process, it tells me that  they're really not ready to make a change, and that really concerns me a lot.  Okay, so do you want us just all to leave?  I don't know what I want right now.  I just don't want to throw up.  And I'm sick.  Wow.  So, I just... 
[01:54:00]  Okay, can I put you in the family room, or in your chair out front?  Do you really want the guys to come in here with a shovel and shovel in around you?  Because that's what's going to happen.  I don't have a choice, and I don't have a choice, so...  If I have to work around me, then that's fine.  They've got a shovel around her?  Because she had to lay down in her bedroom.  She's feeling sick.  What is she supposed to do, run around and tap dance for your amusement?  How about she lays down and get some support, finally? 
[01:54:30]  Look, enough of this one.  We really got to bring these guys.  They can't wait.  What happened?  Well, they've waited long enough.  We could always get back to this fucking shit.  What happened?  We've got to get to these guys.  What happened?  Paradise lost, definitely.  They officially haven't been awaited.  The best documentary I've seen in years.  They've been waiting.  Where are they?  Yeah, it's fantastic.  Well, bring them down the hall.  Where are they?  Huh?  Are they all here, or only two or three of them here?  One of the guys, and then one of the directors. 
[01:55:00]  Okay.  So there's two people.  Okay.  Are both directors coming, or no?  No, just one director.  Oh, I thought we were waiting for someone.  All right, bring them in.  Where are they?  They're in the office.  And the final clip, basically, is just the house is clean, and she's happy, I guess?  Oh, yeah.  And by clean, it's still, I wouldn't go near this place.  I have to pee.  They try to make it look like it's clean.  You want to take a quick break?  Can we take a single?  Yes, absolutely.  Let's take a single.  Two minutes, single.  No, they're not late yet.  They're scheduled for 830.  Everything's good.  So that's where we're at with the hoarder? 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, yeah.  So they clean up, don't clean up, they get the shit out, but there's still shit smeared  on the walls.  Jesus.  It's disgusting.  And they're all happy, because the daughter is now cooking in the kitchen, and she can  stand next to the stove, and she's not walking over garbage.  And she's sort of happy?  Well, they think they are.  They think they are.  Okay.  But not quite.  All right, we need an ending to that whole thing.  We spent 40 minutes on it.  It's disgusting.  All right, very good.  All right, we're going to take a quick break, and then, well.  Yes.  The director of Paradise Lost 3 Purgatory, which is an HBO documentary, and actually one 
[01:56:00]  of the West Memphis Three victims.  Damn it.  And they are victims.  Holy mackerel.  We'll do that next.  Stay there.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  With Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  XM.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  We have returned. 
[01:56:30]  Bring those guys in.  Hi, everybody.  Opie went to the toilet.  The turlet.  And we have Joe Berlinger, who is one of the directors of Paradise Lost 3 Purgatory.  And we have Jason Baldwin, who is one of the West Memphis Three.  Jason, right there.  You guys are victims, man.  You're victims of a horrible, horrible miscarriage.  I feel like I know you.  It's so weird, because the documentary, over the three documentaries, you absolutely went 
[01:57:00]  from us seeing you as a child, pretty much, and now as a grown man, and we know pretty  much everything that's gone on in that interim.  So it's kind of weird to have you sitting here.  It's like, oh, I know this guy.  Right.  Do you find that odd when people kind of know?  Maybe we didn't get Sirius Radio back there where I was at.  No, huh?  Yeah, I wouldn't think so.  Do you find that odd?  Do a lot of people kind of feel like they know a lot about you?  Because, honestly, they do.  Yeah, yeah.  It's definitely odd, but it's very cool.  You know, people just pop up out of the scene, you know, just wherever I'm at at any given 
[01:57:30]  time.  It's like, hey, I just wanted to say, you know, I prayed for you, or I was pushing for  you, or pulling for you, whatever the case may be during this time.  And just glad to see you out, and to me, that's just awesome, you know.  And if we can let people know, most people know this case, this documentary, and all  the ones you've done are enraging.  It makes you so angry watching these things.  Do you want to, in a nutshell, just let people know, I'm sure most people know, but anyone 
[01:58:00]  who might not know exactly what happened to you, or what you were accused of?  Right.  Well, shoot, it was my, I was 16, I was on my last day of school for the 10th grade,  when the police just, um, come and snatch me out of my friend's house, snatch my friend  up, snatch another guy up, and, um, just railroaded us for his crime.  We didn't do.  Um, they refused to listen to reason.  Um, you know, I had family, friends, everybody that was, you know, willing to state where I  was at at the time of the crime.  And so you did have alibis.  It just fell on deaf ears. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah, I had alibis, you know.  And it was the, the murder of three local boys.  Three eight-year-old boys.  Around in a wooded area, um, and yeah, you guys, uh, got scooped up and, and they pretty  much said, that's it, we got our guys, and pretty much made it fit, instead of, uh, trying  to find out who really did it.  And the boys, they thought, were killed as part of a satanic ritual, because there were  scrape marks, which appeared to be knife wounds on them.  One of the boys was castrated.  Um, so it looked like this brutal, satanic ritual crime. 
[01:59:00]  And I remember watching the first documentary, and just being horrified to think of having  been in the woods, because I, I think I thought you guys were guilty the first time, at least  the first part of the first documentary.  Didn't you think that when you first began making the, uh, the first movie of Joe Berlinger  too?  Yes.  Yeah.  You know, I mean, that's, that's the amazing thing about this, you know, three film, two  decade journey, is that when we first went down, all the press reports were incredibly  one-sided.  We didn't know it was one-sided at the time.  We just read these press reports about a open and shut case, overwhelming evidence, 
[01:59:30]  confession, you know, we, so we went down to Arkansas, you know, sent by, uh, HBO thinking  we were going to make a film about disaffected youth.  You know, how, how could three teenagers be so rotten that they could do such a horrible  thing?  And the first couple of months, we had no reason to think otherwise because we were primarily  spending time with the victims' families.  But the first time I met Jason and the other guys, you know, they were all in county lockup  awaiting trial and the, you know, it took us a couple of months to negotiate access. 
[02:00:00]  And once we did the interviews with these guys, we were like, wait a second, something's  not right here.  I mean, Jason was incredibly, um, he just drips with credibility.  He, you know, he does now, he did then, he just was incredibly believable.  You know, all the guys, we just totally believed that.  I mean, it's not like we said, oh my God, they're innocent because that would be journalistically  a little quick to judgment, but something didn't feel right after we did those interviews.  Then we got to know the attorneys.  Then we started digging into the evidence and we realized the evidence was incredibly 
[02:00:30]  weak, incredibly circumstantial, no physical evidence linking these guys to the crime.  And we were naive enough to think that, well, this will all work itself out at the trial  because we actually arrived, you know, days after the arrest.  We embedded ourselves in that community for about eight months before the trials began.  So we really were there.  We really dug in.  And, and by the time the trials began, we, we were convinced of their innocence, but I  guess naive enough to think that, you know, the justice system will work and they'll present 
[02:01:00]  their case and they'll be acquitted.  And we then sat through a two week trial for Jesse Miskelley followed by a three week trial  for Eccles and Baldwin.  And our mouth, you know, it was just jaw dropping.  I mean, our, our, our tongue was on the floor half the time of this trial because again, no  real physical evidence and rumor, innuendo, ghost stories were being told.  Uh, can I ask you a question, Joe?  Sorry to interrupt you, but, uh, I think, uh, Jason Miskelley, his name is Jesse. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, I'm sorry, Jesse.  He, now there was a false confession, which I think is really hard to get around for defense  lawyers, even if it was coerced, which I'm sure it was coerced.  Um, or he wasn't the brightest guy.  He was, was he, was he 72 IQ?  Yes.  And not the brightest guy.  And when you give a confession where you're going, uh, well, we did do this and we did do  that.  It's hard for a jury to wrap their head around the fact that like, this is not true.  Because anybody would say, look, I would never say I did something if I didn't do it. 
[02:02:00]  So it, it does hold a lot of weight with, with the jury.  Yeah.  Well, you know, false confessions are a very common phenomenon.  People under pressure, under police interrogation, you know, will say things just to get out of  that immediate situation.  The less intelligence you have, the more you're not thinking long-term.  You're just thinking, I got to get out of this, these five cops breathing down my neck  for 12 hours.  And as you see in the film, you know, there were very leading questions. 
[02:02:30]  You know, he wasn't getting certain key crime scene facts that if you were there correctly,  you know, the crime happened at night and he started off confessing saying it was during  the morning and he gave five different times of day until finally the police led him to  the right time.  And it is hard to imagine for rational people in normal situation, why would I ever confess?  But all that person is thinking is I'm going to just say the right thing.  I'm not going to implicate myself.  And I just want, this will get me to get out of the situation.  And I'll work it out later. 
[02:03:00]  They just want to get out of that room, that interrogation.  And his only confession wasn't the first one in that case.  Really?  Yeah.  There was a guy who drove the ice cream truck and right after the murders, he took off  out to California to Oceanside and Oceanside Police Department picked him up and forced  him into a false confession for the very same crime.  What did you think too, when you heard that, you know, you three are friends and you'd all  been arrested for this, what, how did they tell you, hey, one of the guys confessed? 
[02:03:30]  Well, at the time, my attorneys were still trying to figure things out.  They wasn't, they weren't sure if they actually had innocent defendants.  You know, they're just trying to figure things out.  But, you know, as a defense attorney, they're going to defend no matter what.  So they're trying to wrap their minds around this false confession of Jesse's and they couldn't  figure out why everything was all mixed up.  You know, of course, they didn't even know when the actual crime occurred because they're  not getting all their information from the state. 
[02:04:00]  You know, they're just trickling in a little bit of the evidence at a time, you know, just  keeping my attorneys in the dark as to what happened or what was believed to happen and  all that.  So when I was told Jesse made a false confession, the first thing in my mind, the closest analogy  I could come with it is a schoolyard bully bullions a kid in the crying uncle.  That's what the police department did to Jesse.  Were you angry at him at all?  They just held him.  No, I'm not angry at him because it wasn't his fault.  He was, he was just a kid. 
[02:04:30]  He wasn't the one with the authority and the vows to protect and serve the innocent.  You know, those were the West Memphis Police Department's vows.  They're the ones that were supposed to protect Jesse, supposed to protect us.  They're the ones that were supposed to protect the community.  They're the ones that got out of line when they made his kid confess to a crime he didn't  do.  And when you're going into, when you look back on this and from the process, do you think  the main culprit or, because of the three guys, you seem to be the one who is the most 
[02:05:00]  vocal about being angry and which I can certainly imagine I would be too.  I can never understand how people aren't angry when they come out of these situations  after having been so fucked by so many people and how they can go, I'm not angry.  Like, how could they not be?  At least you seem to be able to not hide the fact that you're angry, which is a relief  to say that, you know, I would feel the same way.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, the thing about that is you don't want to let righteous anger turn into bitterness  and things like that to where your whole existence is clouded by just that, you know, 
[02:05:30]  because, you know, I'm free now and the circumstances aren't correct.  There are things being done to make it correct.  But at the same time, I still got to enjoy my life.  Right.  Because today is today.  And once it's gone, it's over with.  What was the first thing you did when you walked out?  The very first thing, I went and got an ID so I can get on a plane and get out of the  Mid-South.  You wanted to leave for good?  Well, yeah, you know, when you're a kid growing up, even without all of this baggage that, 
[02:06:00]  you know, all this bad stuff that happened, you always dream of what's over the horizon.  You know, you always want to go check out what's in the next state, what's in the next  country, what's out there.  So having spent 18 years in lockup when the farthest north I'd ever been was a Craighead  County Jail, the farthest, you know, west I'd ever been was a Pine Bluff unit and, you  know, diagnostic unit in Pine Bluff, far the south was the Varner unit in Grady. 
[02:06:30]  I definitely wanted to get somewhere and see some things, you know.  To get out of it.  You know, and I had all these great letters coming from people all over the country, all  over the world, you know, saying, you know, we believe in you 100%.  When you get out, drop by and say, hey, you know.  So I definitely want to check that out.  That just, it seemed, watching the documentary, so futile to try anything.  It had to be so hard through all those years to think that you were ever going to really 
[02:07:00]  get out.  It just seemed like everything that came up was against you.  I wasn't hopeless, but I felt helpless.  For one, everybody I came in contact with, from Joe to different officers on Miss Cureton  and at the county jail, lock up all the way into prison, after spending time with me and  talking to me, and stopping to actually question what was going on, they would be like, you  know what?  I believe you, and I hope you're freed, but they just couldn't do anything about it. 
[02:07:30]  They didn't have the keys.  And whereas Judge Burnett, the prosecutor, Fogelman, Brent Davis, whereas they had the keys,  but they refused to listen.  They refused to reason.  I found them to be repulsive.  I tell them I'm innocent.  I tell them where I was at that day, and it did not matter.  They did not care.  They did not consider anything.  They were unreasonable.  What an abuse of power, man.  It really made me hate the state, not Arkansas or Tennessee or New Jersey, but the idea of 
[02:08:00]  the power that they can wield over you.  So, I mean, this is the classic example to just show you just how that power is abused.  You know, there was a DNA statute passed in Arkansas in 2001, which ultimately was the  key to why they finally got out.  That statute was passed in 2001.  The state and the defendants argued for several years whether or not they could actually do  the testing.  You know, why would you not allow somebody who's claiming innocence to have any? 
[02:08:30]  So they argued for several years about whether they can do the testing.  Then they argued how the testing was going to get done.  Then they argued, you know, who's going to do the testing.  Finally, the test results after six years come out in 2007.  Very compelling DNA evidence that's quite exculpatory for these guys comes out in 2007.  It takes a year for Judge Burnett to then deny that they deserve a new trial based on that  DNA evidence.  He says the DNA evidence is not compelling. 
[02:09:00]  Then it takes two years to go to the Arkansas Supreme Court.  And thank God, the Arkansas Supreme Court in November of 2010 says, you know what?  These guys do deserve an evidentiary hearing based on this DNA evidence and set that date  for December of 2011.  That means 10 years have gone by to argue about and to get DNA evidence in front of a judge.  As soon as that date was set for the 2011 evidentiary hearing, that scared the shit out of the state. 
[02:09:30]  And the state in 10 days makes this Alford plea deal.  You know, on August 9th, 2011, because they fear this evidentiary hearing.  They could have done that 10 years prior.  August 9th of 2011, they start talking about an Alford plea.  August 19th, 10 days later, they're out of prison.  Whereas 10 years had gone by where they tried to stop this DNA evidence.  Because some scumbag judge and some scumbag prosecutor doesn't want to admit that they did 
[02:10:00]  something wrong, and they're worried about their own record.  Absolutely.  And the state's liability, I'm sure, for financial...  I mean, you see it in the movie.  The new prosecutor, Scott Ellington, who had nothing to do with the original travesty of justice,  but he says quite blankly in the film that, you know, we're doing this because we don't want to get sued.  We don't want to get sued for millions of dollars.  I can't imagine you're sitting in prison knowing, holy crap, I could be out, like, next week,  and now you have to wait another 10 years. 
[02:10:30]  I can't even imagine what that would feel like.  That's what happens when you're poor, and, you know, one of you guys said we were just poor white trash,  or someone said that, like, that's how they viewed you.  You didn't have the money to get...  But what were you thinking, knowing in 2001, you know, I could be out tomorrow.  This is going to set me free.  And then you have to wait a decade.  Well, I knew what I was dealing with by that point.  Yeah, no surprise.  I knew that...  I would lose my mind.  I knew that Fogelman, Brent Davis, and Judge Burnett, I knew that they didn't just make a mistake 
[02:11:00]  and pick up the wrong guys.  They deliberately made people lie on us.  They deliberately took career criminals and gave them a free get-out-of-jail pass if they would lie on us.  They deliberately forced Jesse to admit to doing something he did not do.  These are not mistakes.  These were calculated things.  These were an abuse of power.  And they continued that abuse all throughout this by trying to fight us to get the DNA tested.  So how did you deal with that in prison? 
[02:11:30]  From 2001 to 2011, how did you deal with that?  In prison where I was at, it's a different place.  They put you to work.  You work every day, and you get a schedule, and you have to work or you're going to be in the hole.  So you have all this stuff going on, and then you have working, doing day-to-day life stuff,  trying to keep your mind right, not just for you, but your family.  You know, I got a mom. 
[02:12:00]  I got two brothers.  You know, at the time, I was 16, but my brother Matthew was 14.  My brother Terry was 9.  They got expelled from school the following year because they would stand up and fight for my name  when people would say crazy things to them, you know?  Yeah.  So I'm, and my mom, she suffered, I don't know how many nervous breakdowns because of it  because the whole community just turned against her besides, you know, the people she just knew, you know?  So I try to be strong for them so they don't think that I'm just, you know, dying in there or being abused in there. 
[02:12:30]  By the way, how did the other prisoners treat you?  Because crimes against kids are a rough one when you go to jail.  Those are the worst ones ever.  A high-profile crime like that, were you guys given a hard time by the other inmates?  Well, when I landed at the Varner unit in 1994, in May 21st of 1994, they were waiting on me.  Everybody had already seen the trials on TV, you know, and they were waiting on me.  It was a fight.  I mean, I've got a shattered skull, broke collarbone, all types of scars over my eyes and stuff just from fighting. 
[02:13:00]  But as the years went by and, you know, people started respecting me, started getting to know me, who I really am.  Joe Bruce's documentaries came out.  People started coming to prison who had seen that.  The officers who worked there started to see that.  And slowly but surely there was a paradigm shift.  Instead of people hurling fists at me, curses at me, you know, it turned into hugs and prayers.  And like, man, we really hope you get out of this place. 
[02:13:30]  You know, our guards would bring me, you know, hamburgers, MP3 players, whatever, just to make my stay there easier.  You know, they would tell me all the time, man, I wish I could just give you the keys and let you out.  What's the guy's name, the judge?  Because I think he's running for some office down there.  Judge Burnett.  Burnett.  Well, he actually already has been elected to state senate.  He's a senator.  Oh, my God.  And that was the key.  His election to state senate was one of the watershed events that actually allowed this deal to happen. 
[02:14:00]  Because he wouldn't recuse himself, right?  Right.  I mean, one of the greatest travesties has been amongst a long list of travesties has been Judge Burnett.  You know, it is legal in Arkansas and some states for the original trial judge to then preside over the appellate process, which is, to me, completely counterintuitive.  Right.  As if it's a new set of eyes and ears on this.  Exactly.  As if the original trial judge during the appeals process is going to find fault with how he ran the original trial. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, yeah.  It's just insane.  But this guy, for 18 years, there were dozens and dozens.  I mean, we touch upon a few of them in the movie, but in reality, there were dozens of appeals.  And the process was Burnett would deny the appeals.  The Arkansas Supreme Court would affirm the denials and just everything for years and years.  This dirtbag fighting the DNA or the evidentiary hearing or fighting to talk about the DNA, it proves to you everything you need to know about how they don't care if you're innocent or guilty. 
[02:15:00]  Wouldn't you want the truth, regardless of anything, wouldn't you want the truth and if there's some new technology to be used?  And I could understand if their point was that they did not have the funding.  But we had private funding.  Oh, yeah.  And then the evidence was going to go to an accredited laboratory that people all over the United States use, different police agencies use, the FBI use.  So there was no question about how good it was going to be done and it getting done and it being paid for.  And it could have strengthened their position. 
[02:15:30]  Had you guys come up DNA guilty, every movement to free you would have been ended.  Well, the problem with that was they knew we were innocent.  They knew.  They knew they totally set it up.  It was not a mistake.  So they knew beforehand.  Yeah, they didn't even need to see it.  An amazing turn in this case, too, was that there was a hair found in one of the ligatures.  Because the boys were tied up and they were found in the woods and there was a strand of hair, I think.  Right.  And it exonerated all of you guys.  Right.  But it gave a 1.5% chance that one of the stepfathers. 
[02:16:00]  Actually, it gave a 98.5% chance.  Oh, my God.  I got that completely the wrong way.  Wow.  I just did my math backwards.  Yeah, yeah.  No, it matches.  Good with the Columbo.  I know.  It matches 1.5% of the population, including Terry Hobbs, one of the stepfathers.  So, you know, it's very compelling DNA evidence, you know.  I mean, the point of the DNA is, you know, it's hard to point a finger to somebody else after what we've all been through with this case. 
[02:16:30]  The point is there have been numerous items from the crime scene tested and not a drop of DNA points to the West Memphis Three.  That is the point of all of this DNA.  It points to other people.  I had long hair back then, and my stuff shedded like a dog, you know.  So, if I was there, there would have been hair everywhere.  And they found a hair which, again, could have been his.  Maybe it's not.  And there was apparently, they asked him, there was a witness that saw him talking to the three boys the night they disappeared.  And he said he hadn't seen them. 
[02:17:00]  He said he didn't see them.  Someone else said that she saw him talking.  And they go over all this in Paradise Lost Three.  The documentary on DVD.  Yeah, purgatory.  On HBO.  I don't know if you can get it on HBO right now.  I have the DVD.  It's on HBO.  It premieres Thursday.  This Thursday, January 12th on HBO.  I felt so special when I got the disco early to see it.  I went home and put it right.  I don't have one of those.  Jeez, give him one for Christ's sake.  Give him yours, Jimmy. 
[02:17:30]  No, but I've seen it.  Something other than just the trial itself and how you guys were railroaded.  You get out.  You're not really used to this limelight thing.  All of a sudden, you're pretty much considered a celebrity at this point.  How are you reacting to that?  I don't know.  How am I reacting to it, Joe?  He's, you know, it's been amazing.  You know, first of all, he's an incredibly impressive guy.  You know, how he's maintained a lack of bitterness, how he's educated himself in prison. 
[02:18:00]  His attitude towards life has been pretty amazing.  But we've had a great time, you know.  Within a couple of, you know, I have some great memories since, you know, over the last couple of months.  You know, literally just a few weeks after he got out of prison, you know, I'm friendly with Sting and Trudy Styler from my previous movie, Crude.  And so Sting invited us to his 60th birthday party concert at the Beacon.  And so I invited these guys.  And, you know, after about the third song, I'm thinking to myself, my God, Jason was in the Slammer like three or four weeks ago. 
[02:18:30]  And here he is at the Beacon in New York City, you know, rocking out with Sting and Bruce Springsteen.  And, you know, that was really special.  We can get that ticket.  And then, you know, Metallica has been a huge supporter of the West members three and of our films right from the get-go.  I mean, the Metallica that were the first ones in, giving us all that great music for the films early on.  And so we were having dinner in September and, you know, he was telling, Jason was reminding me how much he loves Metallica still and telling me all these stories of how he smuggled the music in. 
[02:19:00]  Every record, you know, somehow made it into the prison.  And so I said, oh, I got to tell Lars this.  So I texted Lars.  I said, hey, man, I'm with Jason Baldwin.  He's telling me some great stories.  And so Lars called me back, and they got on the phone, and they had this, like, beautiful half-hour chat.  And then I get the phone back.  This is Lars Ulrich from Metallica.  He says to me, oh, my God, that was so amazing, but I was so intimidated.  Which I thought was amazing.  And then, you know, the film premiered in Amsterdam. 
[02:19:30]  There's a, you know, really great documentary film festival in Amsterdam.  It's kind of the big documentary event in Europe.  And so I brought Jason, and, you know, we had this great time.  We had Thanksgiving dinner, my family and Jason and his girlfriend Holly.  And we, you know, had Thanksgiving dinner in a floating Chinese restaurant in the harbor in Amsterdam.  So just being able to do these things with him for a guy who had his youth robbed from him has been really extraordinarily rewarding.  Did you have any dreams or aspirations to do something at 16 that just obviously you never got a chance to do? 
[02:20:00]  You know, because your life completely took this very obvious fork at that point.  Well, think back when you were a teenager and you're going to school.  The biggest thing that's coming up is the summer.  Summer vacation, right?  Summer vacation.  I'm in 10th grade.  It's my last day of school.  Oh, man.  I got it worked out to where I'm going to get my first job this summer vacation. 
[02:20:30]  Sacking groceries at Kroger.  I'm going to learn to drive.  My next-door neighbor is helping me learn to drive.  She's going to help me get a driver's license.  All these different things that are really necessary for a 16-year-old guy, you know, to impress his girlfriend and all that stuff, you know.  And I never got my first day of summer instead of having fun was in freaking West Memphis Police Department.  Crazy jail.  And you could have had no inkling that it was going to go on as long as it did either. 
[02:21:00]  I had no idea where that was coming.  You had a girlfriend at the time?  Yes, I did.  And it was weird to me when you see, like, the old clips of the girlfriend interviewed.  At what point, because, you know, your relationship at 16 is so important.  At what point did that end where she's like, I just can't stand by you?  Well, we exchanged a few letters, and it was really difficult.  They took me to the Jonesboro County Jail, and I was there for, like, two weeks before I was ever even able to talk to anybody.  My mom had traveled the entire state and visited every jail trying to find where I was at. 
[02:21:30]  She had actually came to that jail twice, and they told her I was not there.  Jesus.  I wasn't allowed out to make a phone call.  You're talking about one phone call?  When was that?  Nothing.  So my mom's freaking out, doesn't know where I'm at.  So finally she finds me, and, of course, my girlfriend's talking to her, like, where is he?  What's going on?  No one's saying anything, right?  So, you know, after I was found and everything, my mom was like, you can write him through me.  So it's kind of hard to exchange letters with your girlfriend through your mom. 
[02:22:00]  Through your mom, yeah, yeah.  Right?  So, I mean, after a few months went by, I mean, the jail scene is incredibly difficult.  Visits, behind the glass, 15 minutes.  My mom would try to come see me as much as she could.  Didn't get to see my girlfriend, and I just wrote her.  I said, hey, you know, this is some really crazy stuff going down right now.  When I get out, we can see each other and try to, you know, pick up where we left off or whatever,  but I don't want you, you know, staying tight of me during all this madness. 
[02:22:30]  Whatever happened to her?  She eventually grew up, apparently, and got married.  I think maybe had some kids and stuff, but, you know, life goes on.  So, yeah.  Where did you meet your new girl?  She started writing me about eight years ago while I was in prison.  You know, she is this really cool, smart, she was in college, traveling the world.  She went to Spain, sent me postcards from Spain, all over the United States,  and now we're getting to go do some traveling together. 
[02:23:00]  And we're actually trying to find a place that she hasn't been to yet.  Oh, yeah.  But she's always like, I've been here, check this out, this is really cool, this is cool.  Did you go through?  Oh, yeah, I remember I got a postcard from here from you, you know.  Did you go through any anxiety as far as being out in the world?  Because being locked up that long, especially from so young,  I would think you'd be a little anxious being let loose like that.  I don't because everybody is so nice, everybody is so cool, you know. 
[02:23:30]  They're just, you know, like you said when I came in, you know, it's like you know me.  You've seen the films, you know, you watch me grow up,  and a lot of the people I meet are like that, you know.  How are Damien and Jesse holding up?  I saw Damien the other night.  I went to, he's got an apartment here up here in New York,  and I went up there on a surprise visit, dropped in and said hey to him.  He's putting on a lot of weight.  His wife, Lori, bought him a weight set for Christmas,  so he's like benching and pressing, you know, bench pressing and stuff. 
[02:24:00]  And he's looking really good.  I talked to Jesse on the phone.  He stayed in Arkansas.  He says he doesn't even leave the house.  Wow, really?  And it's really, you know, it's really sad.  But I asked him, I said, you know, I know why he's there, to stay close to his dad.  And he said he doesn't even hardly get to see his dad,  and that's the reason for staying there because his dad's health is failing and stuff.  I said, well, where would you want to go, you know, if you could just get up and go anywhere? 
[02:24:30]  He said, Spain or Alaska.  So I was like, buenos dias, amigo.  He says, what?  I said, well, that's what they speak in Spain.  He goes, I'll stick with Alaska.  Oh, jeez.  What was the biggest surprise when you got out of jail about the world and how it changed?  Oh, well, you know, there really is not a surprise.  But was there one thing where you went, oh, my God, this is happening?  Internet porn?  Yeah, yeah.  Something?  You know, media makes a great effort in keeping you informed of what's going on, you know. 
[02:25:00]  I mean, there was TV in prison.  Yeah, yeah.  No, I get all that.  But you can see the commercials of cell phones and the Internet and all that.  Yeah, so it wasn't like you stepped out into outer space or something.  But there had to be something where you went, oh, my God.  But to actually, you know, have a cell phone.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, when I got locked up, I had a Super Nintendo, you know.  That was my thing, playing video games.  And a couple of weeks ago, Holly and I were house-sitting for some friends.  And they had an Xbox 360, and that thing was addictive. 
[02:25:30]  I was up to like 3 or 4 in the morning.  Yeah, tell me about it.  That's what I'm getting at.  Okay, to actually, you know, get to touch this stuff.  Now, are you guys allowed to?  Because you haven't been able to sue, which you should, and get millions.  And hopefully, if the governor, if there's a pardon or something is expunged, or whatever  it is they do, hopefully that can change, because you deserve everything you get financially.  Are you allowed to write a book, at least?  Because you're technically not allowed to if you've been convicted.  The Son of Sam Law says you can't write and profit from a crime. 
[02:26:00]  We never committed a crime.  Right.  So does the Alfred plea?  We write a book that's about our lives.  And Damien's writing a book right now.  Good.  Oh, okay.  And he is working hard on it.  You know, when I got over there, you know, he had, you know, stuff set up for him to work  on it.  And he works on it every day.  You know, he's got a very set, what do they call it, discipline on it.  So he's doing that.  And I say I might wait till I'm 90 to write something.  Wait till something.  When is the second half?  A second half of when you're out and doing stuff.  After I'm writing about things I've done rather than things that have happened to me. 
[02:26:30]  What is it you want to do?  Yeah.  Or what are you doing now?  Right now, I'm traveling with Joe, you know, just seeing the world, seeing the country  and everything.  But in April, I'm scheduled to start school.  I just got my, I got my driver's license.  I got my apartment like six days ago now.  Wow.  I probably spent 30 minutes in it.  Everything just thrown in there, you know.  So you're just getting started.  Yeah.  Wow.  August they got out.  No, I know.  Right.  I think August, right.  I mean, we're up to January now.  Yeah.  Right. 
[02:27:00]  It's taking a little time.  Everybody's been wonderful.  I've been staying with different friends and everything.  You know, it's awesome to be welcoming people's homes and stuff.  But you got to have your own place, your own space.  So I've just gotten that.  I got this awesome scholarship to go to college where it's going to be paid for and stuff.  So that's going to start in April.  So then, you know, I'm going to be able to just start putting my life together.  I hope to go to law school.  My grades are good enough.  Hopefully.  You know, that's a lot of work.  You can't just say, I'm going to go to law school.  You got to put the work first, right?  So – and then use my situation, what I've experienced, coupled with a good education in law. 
[02:27:30]  Maybe I can prevent other innocent guys from going to prison or help people who are already in prison that are innocent get out.  Yeah, I like that Barry Sheck has a project, Innocence, where DNA – and it's sickening that we have to have outside projects instead of the government doing it, where – not people who are legally not guilty, but people who are truly innocent of the crimes they're in jail for with DNA evidence to help them get out. 
[02:28:00]  And the fact that the state doesn't just automatically do this, it makes you just really fucking hate this.  But Sheck is paying penance.  Yeah, look, Sheck has had his share of the wrong side to be on too.  So, Jesus Christ, did you have to argue that point so well?  I know, right?  Yeah.  They're saying – they're telling us you guys have other press to do?  I don't doubt it.  Travis is shaking his head.  So, let's give a really good plug.  It's called Paradise Lost 3, third and final installation.  All of them are unbelievably compelling and just fascinating. 
[02:28:30]  And the whole – it's not – I'm sure when you made the first one, you didn't know there was going to be a second and a third one.  I thought, you know, when Bruce and I made the original Paradise Lost film, you know, by the time it came out, these guys had already been in prison for three years, and we thought this film was going to blow the doors off the case.  Right.  And, you know, to do for the West Memphis Three what Errol Morris' Thin Blue Line did for Randall Dale Evans, that film came out and the guy got off at death row.  We thought the same thing was going to happen here.  No idea it was going to take three films, 20 years or 18 years. 
[02:29:00]  It's just – it's insane.  What's amazing and sort of tragic about it is they are done so well, and having it in three parts like that,  you almost get separated from the fact that these are real people that went through such a horrific thing because it's done so well, and it's compelling, and it has a – now it has a beginning, a middle, and an end.  So it plays like a movie.  Yeah, I mean, you kind of hit the nail on the head for what we went through when the first movie came out. 
[02:29:30]  You know, the film did everything a filmmaker would want.  It won every award.  It got all the great press, and, you know, so, of course, we were very gratified, but we also felt this, you know, this terrible guilt.  You know, you're standing there at a podium holding an Emmy Award, giving some speech, which, of course, you know, I don't want to sound falsely humble.  Of course, that's wonderful.  You know, you want that to happen when you do your work.  But, you know, you're sitting there giving an acceptance speech for a great award knowing that, wait, the real people who are behind this are still rotting in prison and need justice, and so we just made a pledge. 
[02:30:00]  We're going to keep doing this until they get out, and thank God they did.  They got out under embarrassing for the state of Arkansas circumference is that Alford plea in which these guys had to plead guilty to lesser charges and accept, you know, a sentence of time served is just an absolute travesty of justice.  It's disgusting, and at least the prosecutor was so dumb to actually publicly say so.  Well, we don't get sued, and what an ass.  Like, wow, that's – I mean, I'm glad he was honest. 
[02:30:30]  I want to encourage people to go to WM3.org for two reasons.  One, there's a fund for helping these guys get their lives back together, so if people want to donate, there's a fund.  And also there's a petition to, you know, to sign to go to the state of Arkansas saying, hey, you know, exonerate these guys.  Yeah, yeah.  And we've got to keep fighting for that exonerate, full clearing of their names.  Absolutely.  And then hopefully you can get what's coming to you financially.  And what's this guy's name, this pig, this Senator Burnett? 
[02:31:00]  Never let this guy forget on Twitter.  We have a lot of listeners, so I would suggest that if he's on Twitter, which a lot of people are, you should really let him know how you feel about his despicable behavior.  In your inimitable fashion.  Yeah, no harsh language, please.  But just let him know how disgustingly he behaved.  And hopefully he will go the way of Nifong, the guy who tried to screw those guys at Duke.  Well, the way American history is, he'll probably end up being the next president.  I know.  Exactly, right?  I know. 
[02:31:30]  Oh, my God.  Hey, thank you so much.  I'm happy you came.  Best of luck with the rest of your life.  I mean, enjoy.  Thank you.  Have some fun.  And we'll hopefully see you guys again.  Yeah.  Well, no Paradise Lost Four.  Hopefully the saga's over.  Yeah, really?  Three's a good number.  Unless it's something fun, like Paradise Lost Four, the guys go on spring break and get laid.  It'll be a whole Paradise Four lost.  Paradise found.  There you go.  Awesome.  Great, man.  Thank you, guys.  Thanks a lot.  Y'all right.  The Opie and Anthony Show on Sirius XM.

[02:45:00]  I'm still trying to figure out what the hell the show's about.  All right.  All right.  That was, um...  I'm feeling good.  Amazing radio right there.  I liked it a lot.  That was, uh...  Really cool.  I liked it a lot.  Especially...  You've got to see it.  I've got to admit, I've never seen the movies.  You've got to...  I know a bit about it, but I haven't seen the documentaries.  But that was really, really fascinating. 
[02:45:30]  Do all three right in a row.  You'll be like, holy shit.  How do you do that?  Hey, you go on demand.  Is it all on demand?  Yeah, on demand.  I might have to do that.  You might be able to get the first two on iTunes or something, too.  You can.  Yeah, you can.  My favorite part was him describing, at 16, what he was about to do.  Yeah.  Getting the license to impress the girl.  We all...  It brought us all back.  Like, okay, you've got to get the job because you need some pocket money.  You get your driver's license.  Then you're finger-popping in the woods somewhere.  Oh, yeah.  Next thing you know, you're in jail going, what?  For 18 years.  And now he said, I just got my driver's license. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  So he was supposed to get it in the summer of 94-ish, right?  I was wondering if he was going to go back.  I guess it in 2012.  Back to Kroger's for his bagging job.  He loves Kroger's.  He does not want to go back down south, though.  Wow.  They must have had great employee benefits.  Yeah, I guess so.  Because he was very excited about his job at Kroger's.  He said he will just not go back down there.  And fuck, man.  I mean, I thought the interview was great, but then he revealed something right after the  mics went off about the food poisoning thing, which was hilarious.  Oh, like, yeah, the day he got out or two days after he was out? 
[02:46:30]  Well, it's hilarious because, you know, it prevented him from having sex.  Yeah, he was going to hang out with his chick and they were going to get a little intimate  finally.  You know, the girl that was with him for eight years while he was in prison.  And they're writing back and forth.  Finally, he's out.  Finally, they could have sex.  And he gets food poisoning.  They had some of that scrimp.  And then he says that it almost killed him.  Yeah.  So jail didn't kill him, but two shrimp almost did his first day out, basically.  That would have been horribly ironic.  I want to get Damien in here, too.  What a great story.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:47:00]  I'd love to talk to Damien Eccles.  And Jesse, if he ever came up here.  With the clock tattoo on his head.  His girlfriend is all right, man.  Yeah.  She's cool.  And does he reveal where he lives?  Because he told us.  I don't know if he says it publicly.  He didn't say it on the air.  Yeah.  Let's just say Pacific Northwest.  That's all you need to know.  Safe to say he decided to move as far away as possible and stay in the United States.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  So that was cool, man.  He was great.  And what a nice guy. 
[02:47:30]  I don't know why he hated Travis, but he did.  Oh, yeah.  Couldn't stand Travis.  What do you know about this whole thing, Travis?  I don't know much.  Travis has been one of the celebrities that have been behind this cause.  Yes.  He was Eddie Vedder and Travis Teft.  Travis Teft.  Actually, he went under the name.  That's the first and last time our names will be in the same sentence.  Dr. Gay.  No.  No.  Dr. Gay had the cure for the West Memphis Three.  Now I feel like I know these guys when I listen to the Pearl Jam channel and I hear  Eddie Vedder going, oh, this one's going out to the West Memphis Three. 
[02:48:00]  Get out of pressure.  Get out of pressure.  Because I've heard him say West Memphis Three a lot, introing songs.  Now I can understand a little more.  Yeah.  A little bit more.  Now you know what they're talking about.  I was going to say, Damien's doing his own documentary, so maybe we can get him in when  that's out.  I would love to, yeah.  Oh.  So Mitt Romney wins the New Hampshire thing.  New hamster.  I wouldn't be surprised if Ron Paul ran with him because Ron Paul is defending Mitt Romney. 
[02:48:30]  What?  As his VP?  You know what?  It's not that bad of an idea because it was defending Mitt Romney's record on certain  things.  He was just saying that the Republicans are attacking him unfairly because that's just  not accurate.  They don't understand the economy.  He will never take Ron Paul as a VP.  Or would Ron Paul take him?  Ron Paul's not going to get the nomination, unfortunately.  Here's what it is.  No matter how good Ron Paul is and his great ideas and the people that love him, he's put 
[02:49:00]  in this category of kooky guy.  Yeah.  I'm not saying he's kooky guy.  Relax, you fucking maniacs.  They're going to attack you now, man.  But he comes off as kooky guy.  Well, he's in that category.  That's why Mitt Romney would never pick him.  Mitt Romney's going to pick someone that we're not seeing every day.  Mitt's getting the nomination.  Who's Mitt going to pick as VP?  He's not going to pick any of those idiots on the stage with him.  I don't think so.  Not that they're idiots.  I kind of like Newt Gingrich being a pain in the ass.  No.  No, I don't think. 
[02:49:30]  I don't know.  Who do you think, Ant?  This is your thing.  I don't fucking know.  No one knows.  My thing, you could ask Hannity.  He don't know.  There's got to be some like, I can't ask Hannity, they canceled me tonight.  Why?  Wow.  What did you do?  Oh, Jimmy, what happened?  I think the whole panel got canceled.  They're probably doing a special show.  Oh, they're doing a special thing?  No, but I bet you if we get Sean Hannity on the phone, he would at least give you a short  list.  Oh, he'd give you a short list.  I bet you that short list has nothing to do with the guys that he's debating against  right now.  I think it's someone, yeah, someone that's just kind of hanging out. 
[02:50:00]  Chris Christie?  Chris Christie.  Chris Christie?  Who revealed to Oprah that he's very concerned about his weight.  Well, he should be.  And he's scared that he's going to die young.  He's a fucking giant.  Stop eating, you pig!  And leave his family heartbroken.  Fuck.  It was in the paper today.  Well, you know what?  But you could do something about that, right?  Yeah, yes, yes.  If you're that worried, then you've got to do something about it.  He should go on Biggest Loser.  He's very outspoken.  The right likes him. 
[02:50:30]  And, yeah, he just needs to lose that fuck.  Look at the bunt on him.  Wow.  God damn it.  That's going to Christie.  He's one of those guys that just doesn't see his dick.  He's probably got one of those inverted penises from the pubis fat.  You think he's got a lot of pubis fat?  You're looking at a VP candidate right there.  I think Mitt Romney picking Christie isn't far-fetched.  Yes.  But he's got to get that weight down.  He's got to go on Biggest Loser.  He's got to cycle through that show first.  Well, Taft was fat, and he was a president. 
[02:51:00]  Taft is incompetent, and he's a producer.  Move it!  Incompetent producer!  Ron Paul did make a good showing, though.  Second place, 23% of the vote.  Yeah.  Was that supposed to happen?  I don't know.  No.  He's not supposed to do that well.  He wasn't supposed to do that well?  No.  Who was supposed to do that well and didn't?  Fucking scumbag Santorum or cunt Newt.  And Ron Paul is doing...  Santorum's fading fast.  He stinks.  And Ron Paul is doing better than anybody expected him to do. 
[02:51:30]  Of course, yeah.  And Mitt's just a large-headed dullard.  He's a typical fucking politician.  Yeah.  He's everything we've ever had.  He's everything we ever will have.  Right.  Right.  So fuck Mitt Romney.  Yeah.  I'm kind of with Jimmy.  Sorry, Ant.  No, you can do it.  We don't like the Mitt Romney.  We don't like him.  We don't like him.  I'm just looking for the best person that can be put out there and beat Obama.  That's all I want.  Is someone that the whole... 
[02:52:00]  Everyone that's a registered Republican out there can get behind and vote for.  And I don't care who the fuck it is.  Just put someone up there that could beat Obama.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  I can't let you off the hook like that.  Why?  This is your thing.  Do you want Romney as your guy?  And if you do, who do you think he should pick?  I think he should pick Christie.  All right.  And Romney's the best choice right now?  Well, he's going to be the nominee.  He's going to be the guy.  Right.  So, yeah. 
[02:52:30]  Okay.  And do you think he's got a good shot at Obama?  I think Romney Christie would be a good ticket.  I think a lot of people are very disillusioned with Obama.  I don't think Obama's going to have that turnout that he had of minorities that wanted to see the first black president.  Typically, it's very hard to get people out to vote that are minorities, the downtrodden.  It's very hard to get them out to vote.  They did it last election because it was a history-making thing to be involved in. 
[02:53:00]  A lot of those people now are disillusioned because they thought they were going to get this free ride.  Is it safe to say he needs all those people to come back for this election?  He does, and I don't think he's going to get that.  All of them.  So, I think, regardless of what he did last election, I don't think he's going to get that turnout.  And I think the Republicans will all rally around anybody that isn't Obama.  It's scary.  I don't know what's going on with Obama.  I'm watching him on the news right now.  It's a clip from yesterday.  I know the old gag is that President's age, but he looks like he has really aged in the last two or three months. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah.  I think he might have stopped with the medicine in his hair because he was obviously coloring his hair.  Do you think he was, or do you think he just fucking went gray?  Nah, because-  Maybe he was never doing the medicine, but-  We talked about it on the show.  Like, all of a sudden, he'd be sort of gray, and then the next time, he wasn't gray anymore.  I'm convinced he was trying to keep the color out of his hair, the gray color there.  Yeah.  The other thing-  Shit. 
[02:54:00]  Oh, yeah.  I got you to sort of admit something before the show.  Is it Peter Pumper?  Well, yeah.  Besides that, yeah.  Of course it is.  Yeah, yeah.  And I suck my dick.  I want to get a montage of all these politicians doing their big speech.  Romney solved America's problems yesterday in his speech after he won New Hampshire.  Exactly.  And that's the shit that drives me nuts because it's so easy to go, oh, Obama's doing this.  I'm going to change that.  He's doing this.  I'm going to do this. 
[02:54:30]  I'm going to- it's not that easy.  Well, you don't think Obama had a few changed fucking things in his speech when he was elected?  I go across party lines on this.  I think they both do it.  Absolutely.  That's why.  I want the Democrats, the Republicans, I want a whole montage of these guys just bullshitting  to America saying, hey, look, he's doing this wrong.  I'm going to change that.  And it's not that easy.  No.  I don't know how you're supposed to do that speech, I guess, because it's all just rah,  rah, rah.  I'm going to make everything better.  Blah, blah, blah.  You're just trying to get the votes. 
[02:55:00]  That's all you want are the votes.  What do you think of Romney's firing people clip?  A lot of people are focusing on it.  That's what Ron Paul defended him on.  Yeah.  Oh, he did?  Yes.  He said that.  Can we play the clip first before you say what you're going to say, Jim, just in case the  people haven't heard?  Yes.  A lot of people talking about this right here.  I want individuals to have their own insurance.  That means the insurance company will have an incentive to keep you healthy.  It also means that if you don't like what they do, you can fire them.  I like being able to fire people who provide services to me. 
[02:55:30]  If someone doesn't give me the good service I need, I want to say that I'm going to go  get somebody else to provide that service to me.  That's fine.  Perfectly right.  What's wrong with that?  Perfectly okay.  The left loves this clip.  And they are playing it a lot.  And Ron Paul jumped on them and said, he said he wants to fire companies.  We all know what he's trying to say.  Yeah, they try to twist it like, look, he wants to fire people.  He wants people out of work.  He means health care providers or whatever companies are providing service. 
[02:56:00]  He likes to make choices.  Yeah.  Anyone that isn't doing you good and you're paying them, you're their customer, you should  have the right to be able to just say, no, leave.  I'm getting someone else.  Someone else.  But he did say he likes doing it.  Good.  Yeah.  Well, who wouldn't like telling somebody that's giving you poor service?  Right.  Take a hike.  I'm going somewhere else.  We all love doing that.  He likes the option of it.  Yeah.  Instead of futzing around like those lazy kids are doing while their mother suffers, we  like to get up and fire people.  Futzing around. 
[02:56:30]  Futzing.  Poor woman.  God bless her.  God bless her heart.  Fuck her in her ass.  On to South Carolina.  Newt Gingrich is staying in the race.  So is Huntsman.  On to South Carolina.  And then New York.  And then Texas.  And then Arkansas.  And then prison for 18 years.  Oh, wait a minute.  Oh, wow.  Awkward.  They're still here.  Oh, boy.  Is he still here?  No.  Hey, do you like Huntsman?  I kind of like Huntsman.  Nah, he's not. 
[02:57:00]  What's his problem?  He's not presidential timber.  What's his problem, though?  I don't know.  I don't think people know him enough.  He hasn't been out there enough.  Maybe next time?  Yeah.  Maybe next time this rolls around?  I really do hate the fact that it really does take a lot of money to become the president,  and that isn't what it was supposed to be about.  Even, you know, Obama doing all kinds of fundraising, and it's like, it's so blatant.  It's not even, it's like, here, come to this dinner.  We're going to charge you $20,000, and it's so we can get this guy elected. 
[02:57:30]  But connect the dots, too.  It takes a lot of money to be president, and guess where they're getting the money from?  Do you get a picture with the president for $20,000?  No, because I already got a picture with the president.  No, no.  Do you get, is that part of it?  I'd go for that.  Bill Clinton greater than LeBron James.  Sure.  Absolutely.  At basketball.  One day you're going to beat me, though.  Bill Clinton not better than all Black Sabbath together.  Oh, Bill Clinton way better.  For me?  Absolutely not.  But in the overall scheme of things, you have to have a picture with the president. 
[02:58:00]  Absolutely not.  If you're in your world, and I got that, and it still bothers you.  No, it doesn't.  But I do believe you will beat me someday.  Of course I will.  How are you going to beat me, though?  It has to be a president.  I'll get two together.  Because we already agreed it can't be a beetle.  I'll get both presidents together, or I'll get Ringo together.  A beetle.  Or I'll get all four stones together, or I'll get something that's...  We got two of the stones there, Jimmy.  Yes, we do, my friend.  Me and Jimmy, right there in the turlet.  That was a close one.  And all four stones together.  But you needed Mick in that, too, so.  And Charlie.  If you had Mick and Keith, I would...  It's not better than Clinton. 
[02:58:30]  A Mick and Keith would have been better than what we got, but...  But we could have started debating.  We did have a Keith.  You don't have a picture yet that we could even start debating this.  No, I would say a picture with all four stones together would be, but it's not...  What about Screech?  I think Muhammad Ali would trump me.  No.  I think a Michael Jordan would trump me.  Nah, he's easier to get.  You can see him in a restaurant.  Those are massive fucking celebrities across the world.  They are, but they don't trump Bill Clinton.  Bill Clinton's a fucking...  There's no...  No.  And then it depends on what present you get, because I still could have the better picture. 
[02:59:00]  Like, if you get Carter, I still win.  Yes, you do.  Why?  Because then you've got to decide which present's a bigger fucking star.  Clinton's a better one.  Eight-year president.  Hold the phone.  You get a Jimmy Carter picture?  Is bigger than my Bill Clinton picture?  No.  Well, I think Carter, first of all, isn't going to be around as long as Clinton, if things work out that way.  Clinton hung with the stones.  Carter is a more... 
[02:59:30]  Who did Carter hang out with?  Historic.  I think he...  He hangs out with regular people at Hammers.  The earlier the president, the better.  No.  I think...  Yes.  No.  Oh, by the way, did I tell you my dream that Gerald Ford turned me down for a picture?  I dreamt recently, but I forgot about this, that I was in an elevator, like, we were getting ready to go out to an elevator, and Gerald Ford was there, like, hanging clothes on a rack, and a bunch of us were leaving, and he was well-dressed.  He goes, go ahead, look if you want to.  And then downstairs, I saw him carrying something in a parking lot.  I'm like, can I get a picture?  And he goes, oh, no, no, no, no, no.  And I'm like, come on, I'll never get this chance. 
[03:00:00]  You guys want a picture?  He goes, no, no.  So what'd you do?  Never happened.  I didn't get my picture with Gerald Ford.  That was my dream.  Never happened.  It was his dream.  Oh, I thought that was real.  No, it was dreams.  No, he said it was a dream.  Oh, I thought it was realsies.  He said it was a dream.  I thought it was for realsies.  And then I wrote unicorns on a cloud.  That was part of my dream.  Jimmy Carter.  I'm thinking about it.  Blows away fucking Bill Clinton.  No.  For a picture.  Monica Lewinsky.  Sorry. 
[03:00:30]  No.  There was a whole scandal, pop culture thing.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  The Middle East fucking peace accord.  He's more than just the president, though.  There was all sorts of shit going on with him.  Egypt, Israel, fucking Sadat Begin.  That never panned out.  That never panned out.  There's still problems over there.  There's fucking, what?  There's problems over there.  I know, but I don't know.  He tried.  I think a picture with Jimmy Carter is better than a picture with Bill Clinton.  I think Carter's easier to get.  What?  I think he travels with less security.  He was up here, Carter.  Bush.  Bush Clinton. 
[03:01:00]  Celebrity pictures.  Fuck, it's hard.  Bush better.  Bush better.  I don't know.  Bush better than Clinton.  You know what?  Because he's a Republican?  Yeah, big wartime president.  I don't know.  What about Clinton?  He's got the dress.  The blue dress.  Clinton was going to have a great legacy as a president.  He's going to go down as one of the better presidents in a long, long, long time.  Oh, yeah, he is.  I like Bill Clinton.  Oh, yeah, he is.  But I think Clinton's out and about more.  Bush is a better picture because Bush is harder to get because Clinton is out and about.  He's popular with Hollywood. 
[03:01:30]  He does hang out with the Stones.  He does a lot of...  Bush doesn't do much.  Bush is just kind of done.  I'm so jealous, the girl.  What about Obama, Clinton?  Obama.  First black president.  I think Obama almost trumps all of them because he's the first in our country's history.  And they will never, ever, a thousand years from now, he will always be the first black president.  Let's break this down.  How many living presidents?  Carter, the Bushes, that's three.  Obama, obviously. 
[03:02:00]  Who am I missing in there?  Is that about it?  Eisenhower.  Clinton.  There's what?  Five living presidents, I think.  Lincoln.  Clinton, two Bushes, an Obama, and a Carter.  That's it.  That's what we're down to, right?  Yeah.  Five living presidents.  So rank them in importance if you've got a picture with them.  Quickly.  I would have to say...  Bush Sr.'s five.  Let's be honest.  Really?  Maybe Obama, Bush, Clinton.  First Gulf War.  It's hard to say, man.  A Carter. 
[03:02:30]  I mean, this is for what I would want.  But I would take any of them.  I just don't know.  It's a very tough call.  It is.  I'd go Obama, Clinton, Bush, Bush Sr., Carter last.  What about any president since they've had cameras?  JFK.  JFK.  Or Lincoln.  Lincoln.  Wait, where do they start?  Lincoln.  Was that real photography back then?  I think that was the first.  I think it was the first photograph of the president, wasn't it?  But they weren't allowed to smile, so that doesn't count.  And it took a long time.  You couldn't just be like, hey, quick pick, Lincoln. 
[03:03:00]  Can I get a quick pick?  Yeah, can I just bring you this room?  It was like fucking set up.  Back then, a Celerity picture took eight hours.  Yeah.  The guy would be like, oh, wait, I didn't put the gunpowder on the little platform to light.  Jimmy would be all mad.  Jimmy's great-great-grandfather is just like, come on, take the fucking picture.  I know.  Twitching.  And Roland.  The guy's trying to light the gunpowder.  Roland's bumbling around.  Hey, hey.  Imagine.  God.  Opie shows up behind him with a stovepipe hat.  Yeah.  Ruining his picture.  Roland with a powdered wig on.  That's a powdered wig.  It's Roland's ancestor. 
[03:03:30]  Four scores.  Is that four scores?  That's how many years ago?  Lincoln's going to be on the show.  Four what?  Four scores.  Tomorrow after he's going to see a play tonight.  He'll be there tomorrow.  He's going to book this on this.  Book tomorrow morning.  And then tomorrow when Lincoln doesn't show up, what happened?  He had to take the red eye back to the coast because he was shooting.  Shot in there.  Some of us.  He's shooting something.  That's it for politics, I guess.  Yeah. 
[03:04:00]  On to fucking South Carolina.  Newt Gingrich being a pain in the ass.  Newt Gingrich stinks.  I guess he was supposed to drop out by now.  A few of these guys were supposed to drop out by now.  He had his, they all, everyone had their ups and then their downs.  And Mitt seems to have been just kind of hanging in there.  And he's the one that seems to be floating to the top.  Yeah.  Mitt's fighting with his gloves on.  Pope says gay marriage is a threat to humanity's future.  Did he say that in his red shoes?  Pope wrote cunt, sir.  Did he say that in his red shoes as he was watching shirtless men do acrobatics? 
[03:04:30]  That's good.  Love to hear what he has to say.  The Pope's an asshole.  How are his red shoes?  Is he still wearing his sparkly red shoes watching shirtless men?  Mm-hmm.  I love those red shoes.  I cannot stomach.  I think it's robes.  This Pope.  I think a threat to humanity was all the priests doing what they were doing there.  Yeah.  Gay marriage is a threat to humanity.  Mr. Pope.  Yeah.  How about the young Nazi organization?  You creep.  So.  How about that?  He didn't see that.  Hitler was a threat to humanity.  Yeah, he didn't see that fucking Hitler was a threat to humanity.  He didn't catch that. 
[03:05:00]  But two guys that want to fuck and then own a stove together.  That's a problem.  Shut your face.  Look at those shoes.  Yeah, look at them with those red shoes.  Shouldn't they be sticking up from underneath a house?  Yeah, they do look like that.  What a creep.  Standing next to that fucking guy dressed like a candy cane.  That's the world you live in?  And you're talking about the way other people live their lives?  It looks like a period film.  It couldn't.  That could not be more homoerotic.  Yeah, it really does.  And his shoes look like a period film.  Red shoes next to a man that looks like he's in a Christmas story play. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah.  And you're talking about what other people do?  Yeah.  Mind your fucking business.  Whoa, he's the Pope.  I don't care.  Mind your fucking business.  Respect.  Enough already.  I don't think he can really judge what's happening in this world.  No, he can't.  In this day and age.  I think he's a little, you know.  Yeah.  Not quite with this world.  Really, you think?  With those shoes?  Out of touch a little bit.  Yeah.  Oh, he sounds really wispy when he talks.  Yes.  There's something happening in Greece and people are...  A lot of butt fucking.  Well, ready for this one? 
[03:06:00]  It's even better than that.  Oh, no.  They're all eating feta cheese and taking big solid shits.  Even better than that.  Any joke you can make will be trumped by this fucking story.  They're all green with envy.  No.  There's an uproar in Greece because they have decided that pedophilia is a disability.  It is.  It's a disability?  It's a disability.  Ow.  It's a disability.  Maybe they mean the kid because he can't walk right now.  Yeah.  And they're trying to see if they can get those little inflatable donut things in short 
[03:06:30]  because he's trying to sit with his sore eye.  It's a disability.  This sore little bung.  Yeah.  Disability groups expressed anger Monday at a government decision to expand a list of state-recognized  disability categories to include pedophiles, exhibitionists, and kleptomaniacs.  Those are all disabilities now in Greece.  I love Greece.  They can't even imagine that this was allowed to go through.  My God.  The new list gives pyromaniacs and pedophiles. 
[03:07:00]  Pyros, too?  Pyros, too.  Made the list.  Disability pay up to 35% compared to 80% for heart transplant recipients.  That's nice.  So you touch a kid in Greece, you're still getting 35% of your pay because it's a disability.  Sure.  I mean, that's breaking it down to the, you know, obviously the nuts and bolts.  That sounds like some kind of fucking legislation those Greek homos would enact.  Yeah.  And I may say Greek homos, much like Reverend Al Sharpton did. 
[03:07:30]  They were the ones eating the bunghole.  They have shit all over their face.  And they come down and go, you eat the ass?  And the Greek homo go, I didn't eat the ass, but they got the shit on their face.  They was the ones eating the ass.  What was the juxtaposition today that made us laugh?  The thing right before that dumb Reverend Al commercial?  It was 1989, this day in 1989 that Reagan gave his farewell address.  So it was this intense Reagan moment saying goodbye.  You know, they do this day in history.  They show that clip on MSNBC. 
[03:08:00]  1989, me and Anne are like, wow.  Because I didn't really know his policy for the most part.  Fantastic.  I loved him as president just because he was the great communicator.  And then right after that was stupid Reverend Al and his dumb blueberry pie analogy.  Yeah, it's something like, and we changed America and I bid you all farewell.  Right.  And God bless you.  And the pie!  We were eating the pie!  And it's like, fuck, man.  Right afterwards.  There's a leader, and so whether you liked him or not, God damn, he knew how to lead and speak. 
[03:08:30]  The great communicator, they call him.  And then you got this fucking Shrek talking about fucking eat the pie.  That couldn't handle his weight issues.  Would a music cue have helped?  What?  Would a music cue have helped?  Well, it might have.  What?  Okay.  Ropers?  Oh, well, that was stuck in my head, by the way.  Oh, the Reverend Al and his music?  Oh, yeah.  Eat the pie!  Is E-Rock working today?  He's, E-Rock beating the pie!  You know, we were having that very serious conversation about the West Memphis Three thing. 
[03:09:00]  Oh, no.  And someone tweeted something that fucking, I wanted to stop everything just to read.  I guess Hostess is going bankrupt.  Oh, they're bankrupt, yes, Hostess.  And someone tweeted, you know, I guess it's because E-Rock's on a low-carb diet.  Oh, boy.  Oh, E-Rock.  They just filed it.  They went right for you.  Right for E-Rock.  How do you make such tasty things and your company goes bankrupt?  That's stupid.  Everyone's getting healthy. 
[03:09:30]  Well, they're trying.  No, they're not.  That's what it is.  Walk around.  That's what it is.  They're not.  There are a bunch of fatties around.  It's like the OTB thing that you talk about.  How do they not make money?  And how is Hostess not making money?  How do you mishandle that company where you have to go bankrupt?  I think people are eating bad, but they're eating other bad stuff, like fried chicken and shit and fast food kind of a thing.  I don't think that you're going into a deli anymore and grabbing, like, Twinkies.  What are we looking at with Hostess?  What are some of their famous treats?  Oh, Twinkies is the huge thing right there.  That's number one, right? 
[03:10:00]  That's it.  So no one's eating Twinkies anymore?  Cupcakes is the other thing.  The big chocolate cupcakes with the white swirl on top.  Well, Magnolia's and Crumb's Bakery and the rest of them.  Yeah.  Yeah, but that's not...  They're taking over the cupcake business.  Yeah.  Even Starbucks has cupcakes.  Everyone has cupcakes.  Yeah, that's true.  You could get a better quality of cakey treat.  At what year did we all decide as adults we need to start eating cupcakes again?  Because I remember growing up, that was a thing where you just never touched cupcakes because it was for kids.  Oh, that's true. 
[03:10:30]  And then all of a sudden, that dressically changed.  Ringdings and yodels.  Those are Drake's.  Don't mix up Drake's with Hostess things, my friend.  What's wrong with you?  I didn't.  You didn't.  Snowballs.  Because there's...  Oh, Snowballs are...  Drake's?  Hostess.  No, Drake's has the yodels and ringdings.  Let's look at this for a second.  How are they bankrupt?  How are they bankrupt?  Hostess snack cakes.  Donets.  Look at that fat pig.  Huh?  Congratulations.  Give me the list.  Let's see.  What do we got?  Yeah.  What about Donets? 
[03:11:00]  Donets.  Those are little donuts.  I was never a fan of...  That come in those little bags.  I was never a fan of Donets.  All right, we're looking at Twinkies.  We're looking at the cupcakes.  We're looking at Ho-Ho's.  Oh, I love Ho-Ho's.  How about your Suzy Q?  Eh, not so much.  They got your Ding Dongs, your Kern Flakes, your 20 legs of lamb.  Your mini muffins, your Hostess fruit pies.  You like fruit pies, Doc?  Snowballs.  Smart Bakes.  What's your number one on that list?  For me, I used to like the Hostess fruit pies. 
[03:11:30]  I'm with you, brother.  Which one?  Lemon?  No, lemon.  Strawberry?  Get the fuck.  Cherry or apple?  I was allergic to cherries.  Oh.  I couldn't partake.  Poor kid, because those were great.  Yeah, I used to love them.  I went apple and I went lemon.  And let me tell you what else I liked on there.  Suzy Q's.  Whoa.  You could taste the sugar crunching between your teeth.  What does a Suzy Q look like?  I don't even know anymore.  Two little fluffy cakey things with that shitty Hostess cream in the middle. 
[03:12:00]  Good Suzy Q.  They were great.  It was like a rip-off for Yodel.  That is a Yodel.  I mean, not a Yodel.  A Yankee...  Not a Yankee Doodle.  Fuck, a Devil Dog.  I fucking hate Devil Dogs.  Those dry shit pieces.  But the Suzy Q cake...  They were so dry.  The cake on the Suzy Q wasn't as dry.  Devil Dogs were so dry.  Do you know what they are?  They should have called that two fucking hunks of bread with a smidge of cream in them.  You'd have to pull the bread off and just lick the cream and throw those two fucking rock  hard hokey buns out. 
[03:12:30]  Yeah, they were horrible.  They stunk, Devil Dogs.  You would have to bite into it twice before you got any cream and that dryness of the outside.  Oh, the dryness.  Devil Dogs.  Yes, I know we have done this break already.  Yeah, we did.  Sex Man, really?  You'd feel that lump of dry cake in your throat.  Yeah, Jim did a 15-minute rant on Devil Dogs.  It was back in May.  Oh, sorry, I don't say back in May.  It was May 17th at 8.15 a.m. to 8.51 a.m.  It actually was May 17th.  It was a photographic memory when it comes to snack cakes.  Iroch, what's your favorite hostess? 
[03:13:00]  Well, a lot of this stuff is chocolate, so I don't eat it.  But the cherry fruit pie...  Quick pony boy.  ...and the blueberry mini muffins.  Blueberry mini muffins.  They're delicious.  And plus you can eat infinity of them because they're just so small.  Infinity of them, yes.  Yeah.  Probably eats them like a Pac-Man eating dots.  I would go with...  He actually goes, waka, waka, waka, as he's throwing them into his mouth.  He makes the Pac-Man noise up and down the steps.  His wife hides all the muffins for him.  We get it, Jim.  Yeah, you're right.  I was just going to continue painting the picture.  Ho-hos. 
[03:13:30]  Ho-hos are good.  I go ho-hos and fruit pie.  That's it.  Don't underestimate a snowball.  Nah.  No, fucking coconut shit.  Snowballs were for the young.  I hate that.  You think the Pac-Man's ever snowballed, Sam?  That's not what we're talking about.  I like the way the coconut marshmallow-y shit came right off the top, just peeled off.  And then you could eat the cakey thing.  Why don't you just get a cupcake with no frosting?  Well, sometimes they weren't available.  You could peel it off like skin.  Yeah, you just pull it off and it would be all he-eye-eye-eye, rubbery, like a fake tit. 
[03:14:00]  Well, Hostess...  Shove it down some singer's blouse.  Hostess is going bankrupt.  Right?  Is it the one I'm thinking of?  Of course it is.  I should have got a...  Remember that.  One of the worst things I ever said.  Show's over.  It's over now.  I remember that one. 
[03:14:30]  That's one of my favorite laughs ever.  You should have.  God.  I should have had a physical.  Physical.  There's another episode of Chip TV online.  What's that?  Oh, it's Chip TV.  Chip-ison.  Chip-a-TV.  Yeah, Chip-a-TV.  New York Comic Con 2011.  Yeah.  It's new.  When did you put it up?  It's a new one.  A week ago.  Who does Chip interview on this one?  She should go to just the comical con one.  Oh. 
[03:15:00]  Doesn't even answer the question at all.  Should we play some of this?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Should play it 30 seconds.  This is Chip-a-TV.  Chip-Chip-ers-in at the New York Comic Con.  Chip-a-TV presents.  Wow.  Listen to this.  This is rocking.  Chip likes hardcore stuff.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I'm going to act like I've just seen this thing, and I want you to shoot me like I've just  seen it, and I'm just improv-ing a little.  Are you doing a little directing here?  Hi, it's Chip-a-TV.  We're here from Comic Con.  Oh, what is that? 
[03:15:30]  What is that?  It looks like a giant bed bug or something.  Or a...  Look at that.  He's got a big horseshoe on his nose.  Come here.  Get this.  This is good stuff.  Looks like he's got a big horseshoe on his nose or something.  Or it looks like one of the tickle bugs, like when your uncle would tickle you, down by  your private parts.  It looks like a giant white-eyed monster or something.  All right.  That's good.  All right.  That's good. 
[03:16:00]  Wow.  Oh.  Oh, hello there.  Did you get a shot of her asshole?  Take a shot of her asshole.  That's kind of a cute girl.  Yeah, with her ass hanging out of her little leotard.  Big breasts.  Hi, how are you?  Hi.  How are you?  Good.  What's your name?  Tiffany.  Hi, Tiffany.  What's your costume supposed to be?  Kara.  Sister who?  Tara.  Sister Tara from where?  Um, this, her character's name is Just Tara.  Just Tara from where?  She's a DC character.  She's a DC comics.  Yes.  Oh, you're just staring at her tits. 
[03:16:30]  Holy shit.  It's so uncomfortable.  Oh, my God.  That's uncomfortable.  She made the rocks do.  She picked up the paper that she bought to cover her chest up because he's just staring  at them.  Not really life.  She just made the rocks do.  Oh, my God.  That's great.  Oh, my God.  She covered up her tits.  What's this guy doing over here?  Looks like he's got, like, a bunch of snow on his head or something.  Film him.  Look at him.  Looks like he's got, like, a bunch of cotton candy on his head or something.  Like, what was this guy?  Did he fall into a cotton candy machine or something?  All right.  Look at all this luggage. 
[03:17:00]  What was this?  I bet you that this is where people forgot their clothes and stuff.  Surprised everybody's not naked.  Wait, hold on.  Let me do that again.  But I'm going to say it, like, look at all this luggage.  Like, I've just seen it.  Hey, what's that guy got cotton candy on his head or something?  He's back.  Look at all this luggage.  What do you think happened to the luggage?  It's like somebody forgot their luggage.  See, something like that.  Just cut that part out where I was asking you.  We should just, like, I'm improvident.  Hi, what's your name?  You should pause it now and let everybody go watch the rest of it if they want to watch the rest of Chip. 
[03:17:30]  Are you uncomfortable, Jimmy?  No.  That is really funny, man.  Thank you.  That was New York Comical.  I've got to see the rest of that.  That's DJ Lance from Yo Gabba Gabba.  Chip TV Show is the YouTube username.  I think there's four parts from New York Comic Con.  How many are up?  Just one?  Just one.  And I could put up.  I mean, they're all edited, so I could put them up today.  Nice.  Very good.  That one came up pretty good.  But you're not supposed to leave the part where Chip asks you to cut it, because it just makes him look stupid.  Yeah, that's true.  You should have cut that out. 
[03:18:00]  I'm not a strong editor.  He does look silly.  I just love...  See, I told you to cut that stuff out.  That's my mistake, Chip.  I mean, you look bad.  You're supposed to do editing and cutting and stuff.  But at least, because both takes were funny, so I figured you'd want people to see both.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  That's true.  People probably won't even remember I said that.  No.  Because I'll be laughing at the second one.  They won't remember the first one.  You'll laugh right through it, yeah.  Yeah.  That chick got good tits.  I didn't even know you noticed.  Fuck yeah.  I don't lick them.  Were you happy with the shot I got of her asshole? 
[03:18:30]  Get a shot of her asshole.  It's just silly.  Of her asshole.  Of her asshole.  It was her ass hanging out, but...  It's almost time to go home.  It's almost time to go home 
[03:19:00]  Oh yeah  I like that  Did we play Anthony from Long Island on Hoarders?  No  We didn't?  You didn't play this yesterday  On an all new Hoarders  A Long Island mansion on the brink of quarantine  And one Italian millionaire who can't let go 
[03:19:30]  I have 7 or 14 disabilities  Anthony used to have a life  Until hoarding took over his existence  This is my stuff  I'm a collector, I'm not a hoarder  What do you want me to do?  You're saying me?  I am not a good parent?  Dr. Robin tries to bring Anthony back  And help him cope with the reality of this situation  Anthony, your gun closet  Do you see what's on your gun closet?  There's roaches everywhere 
[03:20:00]  This isn't good for you, Anthony  How do you even store food in this environment?  The refrigerator has roaches all inside it  It doesn't work  These conditions, they're not livable  How could you have let it get this bad?  I've Epstein-Barr  That young girlfriend of yours moved out?  Danny doesn't even come over anymore  Oh, they didn't care  No  Oh my god, what's that?  Doctor, we found a skeleton  Is that a...  Then my dog died  There's roaches in the movie theater 
[03:20:30]  A karaoke stage filled with rats  Raccoons crawling over child pornography  It's like a carnival of garbage  Oh, on the next  Orders  Jeez, that's good  She's a great actress  That's good  I didn't know if she would read  The raccoons crawling over child pornography line  She did  She's a trooper  She did well  Who's doing the voice?  That's Dr. Robin  No, I know that  The other guy  That's a hell of a voice, man  Oh, that's Mitch  There's a lot of good...  He's fucking selling it  A lot of good voice people here  I want to give him credit 
[03:21:00]  Mitch rocked it  Mitch did that one  And AJ was the guy  Who did the Bob Kelly War Stories thing  That you liked  Oh, I liked that one too  Dr. Sassio  She honestly  Didn't sound anything like she was reading  No, the acting was amazing  Oh, literal, Jimmy  The acting was amazing  Literal, Jimmy  I got my American Airlines Advantage  Platinum thing  And they send me these certificates  Which go  Applause, applause  And recognition of outstanding service excellence  If an employee is really good 
[03:21:30]  You can mail this in  How about this, motherfuckers?  That's their job  How about when an employee is shit  I can mail it in  Ah, good idea  That's the certificate you should be sending out  You want me to just mail it in  To go congratulations to an employee  For doing their fucking job?  No!  I like the way Jimmy thinks on this one  How about you  Hey, if an employee behaves inappropriately  Or rudely  Or is not helpful  Mail this in  How about that? 
[03:22:00]  Yeah  God, what self-congratulating  Assholes the airline industry is  Look at this  There's two, four, six  Eight certificates  What do you get  Entered into a contest?  No  Hey, that lady was really helpful  Because my seat was in the window  I wanted the aisle  She fixed it  Gives a fuck  Good for her  You get so annoying  Because it is annoying  How about this?  Hey, your flight attendant was a cunt  Her name was this  That's it  Hey, you know  I asked for a soda  The lady brought me a soda 
[03:22:30]  Thanks a million  Thanks a million for a soda  When I asked you  Fucking job  Fuck them  Where are you going to be, Jimmy?  I know it's Tempe, Arizona  At the improv  I'm going to calm you down  You're going to get to do some nice plugs  Jan 2728  Tempe Improv, Arizona  Feb 3-4  Kipsy, New York, Madness  Feb 16-18  Punchline, Atlanta 
[03:23:00]  Feb 2325  Fort Lauderdale, Improv  Mar 1-3  Roch, New York  Mar 8-10  Totally-O  Hi-O  That's good  Yeah, I know  You're hitting the road again  I'm shooting something  Oh, man  So I am putting my hour together  All right  And I'm doing a little Tonight Show next week  Yes  And a little Zach Wilde roast  Yeah  Yeah  Very full 
[03:23:30]  Full  Yeah  Oh, I think I'm going to be working at the Melrose Improv 2  Headlining one night on, I believe, Friday  Not this Friday, but next Friday  Good for you  Yeah, you're right  That is good  We got some left coasters that listen to this thing, right?  I hope so  I'm only doing one show  But I'm out there and I can't fly back on the red light  Because I'm doing the roast  So instead of flying back Friday afternoon  I'd rather come back Saturday afternoon  Because there's nothing to come back for  I won't be able to make the show  I don't feel like we have a lot of people in L.A. that listen to our show  Troy says we do  How does he know?  He totally said it in the meeting yesterday  But how does he know that? 
[03:24:00]  Well, we'll see  He said he got lots of people tweeting him and stuff  When he said he was going to California  Really?  On the after show  So we got 10 tweets  So he's thinking, wow, they must be listening  Well, if he got 10 tweets  How do we know they're listening?  We could easily have over 30 people listening in L.A.  I know New York we do very well  But L.A. I never felt like we have a huge audience  Cleveland?  Big audience  Of course  What else they got?  I might shoot in Cleveland  Really?  Not special  Oh  I'm debating Cleveland  That would be cool  Yeah  Good eggs  Because Boston had red tape  That is probably insurmountable 
[03:24:30]  So I'm thinking  What's the red tape?  It is  Well, it's got something to do with  After the Great White Fire  Theaters of certain sizes  You need a smoke machine before the show  For lighting purposes  Not during the show  It just gives it a certain quality  That you probably don't even notice  That they've used them  The light beams and stuff  Show through a little better  But you can't use them in certain theaters  Because of this new regulation  That just took hold  So that's the red tape  It's nothing to do with me  It's ridiculous  It's chemical smoke  It doesn't even have 
[03:25:00]  It's the machine  It's not fire  It's not pyrotechnical  And you need your smoke machine  I think everyone  Some guys have shot without them  And they said they should have had them  The directors have said  They don't want to shoot without them again  That's ridiculous  Because it's before the show  But it just gives an atmosphere  Plus I like to come out in a poof of smoke  And I do a lot of Doug Henning movements  With my hands  Like after a joke  I'll run in  And I'll just go like  And my hands come out  Like I've just done a magic trick  That's gotta look good  It really is  You gotta slide forward  When you do that move though  I've been told  That I'm very 
[03:25:30]  Very  Very showmany  Showmany?  There's a lot of showmanship  Showmany  Showmany  That's  That's the opposite of not many  Showmany  Showmany?  Yeah  I apologize for getting the Ropers song  Stuck in anyone's head  Showmany  Showmany the door  I'm out of here  Showmany the elevator  I'm out of here  Let's leave the people  With Roper  What?  See you tomorrow  I'm out of here  I'm out of here 
[03:26:00]  I'm out of here  Thank you. 
[03:26:30]  Thank you. 
[03:27:00]  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Big guest day on the show today after ONA Live.  Michael Clark Duncan was in here at around 7 o'clock this morning, so that'll replay, you know, whatever, in the second hour.  And this just goes to show where I'm at with who entertains me.  I was very excited that Michael Clark Duncan was coming in.  He's been, you know, Green Mile, Talladega Nights, lots of cool movies. 
[03:27:30]  He's done a lot.  But I was actually more excited to see Omarosa.  Apparently, they're dating.  And Michael Clark Duncan was in here, and he was doing the interview.  And this woman was sitting on the couch the whole time.  And at first, we thought we didn't know who she was.  We thought she might be a publicist or whatever.  But I knew that he was dating Omarosa.  And so I kind of look at her, and I realize that's her from The Apprentice. 
[03:28:00]  That's Omarosa.  Uh-oh.  Watch out what you say.  She's feisty, Mars.  Is she?  Very feisty.  I don't know if you've seen The Celebrity Apprentice.  But she's very feisty.  But that was, to me, more exciting than even Michael.  I always want to call him Michael Duncan Clark.  It's Michael Clark Duncan.  Was Omarosa.  Eric, you don't watch reality TV.  Yeah, I watch Apprentice.  Were you excited?  Not really.  I'm not into the reality people, really. 
[03:28:30]  But you just say you watch Celebrity Apprentice.  I watch it.  But it doesn't mean I'm like, oh, my God, that's that person.  I can't believe that nobody noticed it was her.  Like, she's one of the biggest strictly reality stars I think there is.  Yeah, that's fair.  Like, I don't know who's bigger than her that's just a reality star.  Kim Kardashian, I don't say, is a reality star.  I think she is a socialite.  She falls under the same category that Paris Hilton falls under, which is not reality stars.  They've done reality shows, but they're not strictly reality stars. 
[03:29:00]  They're socialites.  Because I think Omarosa might be the biggest strictly reality star there is.  I might be able to make that statement.  What about Jesse Camp?  Jesse Camp was not a reality star.  He was a VJ.  Yeah, he went through the process of being hired.  No, he was not on a reality show.  He was on a special.  He was not on a series.  He was a video jockey on music television.  That's totally different. 
[03:29:30]  What about Wade Barrett?  That's a wrestler.  You're just bringing up wrestling again?  That was a reality show, NXT.  Oh my god.  UCB Fred.  Yes.  Biggest strictly reality star.  Maybe like Snooki?  Okay, alright, good.  See, that's what I'm looking for, Eric.  Not fucking Jesse Camp and wrestlers.  Snooki is a good answer.  Because the Jersey Shore is a huge show.  I mean, Snooki and The Situation both. 
[03:30:00]  I don't know if I, maybe even JWoww too.  Maybe all three of them.  I can't put DJ Pauly D over Omarosa.  Yeah.  You wouldn't do that, would you?  No, probably not.  Probably just the top three.  Because those are the top three on Jersey Shore.  JWoww, Snooki, The Situation.  Yeah, I would say Snooki over The Situation.  Yeah, but you would also say Wade Barrett and things like that.  Then nobody knows what you're talking about.  Reality show.  Yeah, I would probably put Snooki, The Situation, JWoww in that order.  Yeah.  So maybe Omarosa is the fourth biggest reality, strictly reality star. 
[03:30:30]  Mars, do they have reality shows on Telemundo?  No, but they do have them for UFC fighters.  Yeah, but those are not reality stars.  Those are fighters.  Okay.  You know what I mean?  Like, it's not, like, I'm talking reality, like, Omarosa's not really an apprentice.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Like, she's not, she's a reality star.  And, I mean, on Jersey Shore, they do nothing.  So you don't even have to disguise it as the show's about something.  But I wouldn't say that the UFC reality show counts as reality stars, because those are fighters. 
[03:31:00]  Okay.  What about those competition shows, like for American Idol and stuff like that?  Those are reality shows.  Yeah, but they don't count once the American Idol.  Like, Kelly Clarkson became a legit pop star.  And Carrie Underwood.  Yeah, she's a country star.  So she doesn't count as strictly a reality star.  I still would put Omarosa over both of them for reality show fame.  Okay.  Now, you're talking Survivor.  That's a different story.  Richard Hatch.  Yeah, but Richard Hatch, Richard Hatch was big when the first season came out. 
[03:31:30]  They only bring him up when he's fucked up his taxes.  Yeah, he's not, he's not big anymore.  Like, and Johnny Fairplay is only big because I have his phone number and my cell phone.  Other than that, there's no, there's nothing.  There's no, oh, as a matter of fact, Smith in Minnesota just wanted to suggest him after Open Anthony Live.  Smith, did you hear me?  Yeah, I can hear you.  No, did you hear me?  Ron and Fred's 11 to 3.  Johnny Fairplay, friend of the show.  See ya!  Yeah, I mean, again, I think Johnny Fairplay is only big because he talks to us and he's a friend of the show. 
[03:32:00]  I don't think outside of this universe, Johnny Fairplay is even close to as big as Omarosa.  This is one.  Rich and, yeah, I didn't know we were going to do this.  We usually don't do phone topics here on After Open Anthony Live.  We're trying to talk about the show, but you people are making me lose my focus, Rich and Yonkers.  Just go with it, Sam.  What's up, buddy?  You got to go with Puck.  Puck is bigger than Omarosa.  Everyone knows Puck.  Everyone has a Puck impression.  But do people under 25 know who Puck is anymore? 
[03:32:30]  It's a generational thing.  Yeah, I don't think so.  UCB Fred, how old are you?  I'm 28.  You look younger.  Thank you.  Maybe it's all the weight that you haven't gained.  Puck.  I know who Puck is.  I wasn't really allowed to watch the real world at the time, but I knew that he was a guy who ate his own boogers, right?  Yeah, I mean, he did that. 
[03:33:00]  That was like his kind of claim to fame.  He used to make fun of Pedro for having AIDS all the time, I think.  But yeah, I mean, he was big at the time, but I don't think, like, you know, we got a generation of UCB Freds who their parents didn't want them to see what it was like when people stopped being polite and started getting real.  No.  Everything had to be polite all the time.  Right, so you couldn't watch real world in your house.  But, Rich, you win, okay, for that suggestion.  Roland basically gave me Best Buy's Overstock to give away today. 
[03:33:30]  So you just got a copy of The Scorpion King Part 3 starring Billy Zane and Kimbo Slice on Blu-ray.  Kimbo's on this?  You want this?  No, hell no.  No.  You want it, Rich?  I mean, do I have to watch the first two to get this Part 3?  Yeah.  I don't know if you're going to be able to catch all the subtleties with it, but I'm going to send it to you and you can tell me how it is, okay?  You got it.  All right, I'm going to put you on hold. 
[03:34:00]  I just gave away.  I can't.  Like, people should be angry.  Like, if they call up and say, this is what you've won, it's like, I don't want your trash.  They should be insulted.  Yeah.  Um, what's up, Jason in Detroit?  Hey, Sam.  Um, what about Elizabeth Hasselbeck from The View?  She surpassed everybody.  She did, but there are people...  Oh, get the morning mashup in here.  These are the perfect people for this.  But Elizabeth...  Whoever wants to come in.  Come on, I know.  The, uh, Elizabeth Hasselbeck is famous for being on The View more than she is for Survivor. 
[03:34:30]  There are people who watch The View that don't even know she was on Survivor.  That's why you can't give it to her.  Thank you, Jason.  Um, listen, morning mashup.  You guys are in tune with what the kids are talking about.  Yeah.  You know, pop culture deal.  Um, we had, uh, Michael Clark Duncan in here earlier today.  By the way, Michael Clark Duncan has a very Stanley T vibe about him.  I'm not shocked.  I'm not just saying that because he's black.  Okay.  And you know, Stan.  You know, I see beyond color. 
[03:35:00]  Yes, you do.  Plus, he's much more dark skinned than you, so that's why it's not that.  Okay.  I feel like he's doing a lot of wisdom, and he's very deep.  And he can mesh well.  You could tell he could go with whatever the vibe is.  Okay.  He could go in whatever crowd.  And he wanted to have the jokes, but then spread a little wisdom, too.  Okay.  Okay.  I like that.  That's a Stanley T vibe.  Yeah.  He was in here.  You know he's dating Omarosa from The Apprentice?  Oh.  Wow.  That's disgusting.  I did not know that.  Yeah, that's who he's dating.  That's pretty bad.  Why is that bad, Stan? 
[03:35:30]  That's he, man.  Because you're not a fan.  I'm not at all, man.  Do you remember the freaking first Apprentice?  Oh, yes.  She's not nice.  That's ingrained in my memory and my...  Ugh.  And then on Celebrity Apprentice, she was no friend of Piers Morgan.  Wait a minute.  Do I have to interview her, too, when I interview him?  No.  I don't think they're coming together.  Well, what happened today was...  Yeah.  Michael Clark Duncan was in here, and he had a girl on the couch, and nobody really knew  who she was.  We figured she might be a publisher, she might be whatever, and I was looking over from this  corner... 
[03:36:00]  I know her.  And I go, it's fucking Omarosa, because I knew they were dating, and I was like, that's  her!  That's Omarosa!  And so, you know, we found out.  We talked to her a little bit, but you don't have to interview her, because she was very...  She didn't even really want to get on mic much.  I mean, once we gave it to her, she was willing.  But then why did she come in here with him?  Because that's his boo.  You know what I mean?  That's him.  Is that right, Stan?  John Coffey.  Now, but this is what I was saying.  Other than...  Let's take Jersey Shore out of the equation, because that's just a monster.  I think Omarosa is the biggest strictly reality TV reality star of all time. 
[03:36:30]  Or, yeah.  Right now.  Right now.  No, what about some of the first real worlders?  That's what I said, right now.  Like, fuck.  Like, right now...  Like, if you went on the morning mashup, and were like, hey, guys, remember...  Remember Puck?  All your listeners would be like, nope.  Right.  Because we're 14.  Right.  Like, we don't know who you're talking about right now.  But they'd know who you were talking about with Omarosa.  What about Chumley?  Who's Chumley?  From the Pawn Stars?  Who's that?  I've never seen that show.  From the Pawn Stars. 
[03:37:00]  I think he's bigger.  Look, I'm...  He's physically bigger.  Well, that's true.  And I'm a fan and everything, but I can't say that Chumley is going to get stopped in  the street before Omarosa.  I bet you he would.  He's more recognizable, don't you think?  I've never seen the show.  I've never heard of the guy.  Oh, you'd love him.  Like, if somebody was like, Nicole, do you want to get Chumley from Pawn Stars on the  morning mashup?  I would say negative.  Right.  Okay.  But if they were like Omarosa, you'd be like, look, I don't want to, but I understand.  No, I wouldn't even understand.  I'd say negative. 
[03:37:30]  Why?  Why no?  I just don't, you know, I don't...  She's not nice.  I'm a big fan of Michael Clark Duncan, so I ain't gonna say nothing.  She's not nice.  She was nice in here.  Well, I just...  Maybe she's changed.  Maybe.  Maybe Michael Clark Duncan has brought that kindness out in her.  But you don't think, other than, of course, Chumley from Pawn Stars.  You don't think there's anyone bigger than Omarosa?  Probably not.  Name one.  I don't know.  I can't do it.  Maybe some of the housewives, they've only been on...  They've only been...  You didn't think about them.  Some of them were, you know, celebrities before that. 
[03:38:00]  Well, who's Kelly Clarkson?  Yeah, but I talked to Iraq about that.  You know, the sex man?  Yeah.  And I told him her biggest fame came as a pop star, not strictly as...  Reality.  You see what I'm saying?  Wait a minute.  Wait.  Rewind.  Why is Iraq the sex man?  Well, because...  You see his hair?  Yeah.  He's good at doing the sex.  His nickname...  No, but his nickname...  What's his nickname?  Trust me.  It's the sex bagel.  Iraq, tell a morning mashup how you got that name.  It's a great story.  No, it's a name I got in college. 
[03:38:30]  End of story.  What did you say?  I didn't hear it.  No, there's got to be more to it than that.  Tell Nicole the story.  No, that's right.  It's a name I had in college.  That's all you need to know because it's really boring.  No, no, no.  Tell the story.  But Sam insists on bringing that name up and not letting it die.  I've got good college stories.  If you give me one of yours, I'll give you one.  This isn't a good story.  We want to hear Nicole's story.  Just say it just to hear Nicole's story because they're...  Tell the story, Eric.  Okay.  Sex, wait.  You eat a bagel?  No, I got a...  Yeah, good one.  That's what happened?  No.  Then tell it.  Then tell it. 
[03:39:00]  I was doing some stupid radio shift at my college station and the show after me was  trying to be like a Lovelines kind of thing and they had me hang around.  I answered some dumb question and because my last name rhymes with bagel, the guy was  supposed to say, he was trying to say, oh, like be smooth, saying sex advice from the  bagel, but he stumbled and he said advice from the sex bagel and it just was so dumb  that I kept it.  Out of choice?  It was a goof at that time.  That's a good one.  Sam won't let it go. 
[03:39:30]  I love that story.  That's the story?  Talk about fucking in college.  It's not a good story.  Maybe it's the way you told it before.  I thought it was good.  It wasn't good this time.  I'm so excited about it.  What's your story, Nicole?  Because last time Nicole came in here, I don't think you guys were with her.  She just came in to announce to the world that her fiance, whose name is Matt, ejaculated  into her eye.  That was not...  I didn't just come in and say that.  Do you remember that part?  You remember that, right?  You shared that?  It happened to come out and it wasn't as graphic as...  Right into your face. 
[03:40:00]  Okay, this is my story because you told your stupid sex bagel story.  Make it better than this.  No, make it hot.  Go.  So my first experience with another girl was with a boyfriend and we were on spring break.  We were in Acapulco and we were out.  It was obviously we were...  What year of college was this?  How old are we talking?  I was a sophomore.  So about 19.  Yeah.  Number 19.  And we were obviously intoxicated and, you know, among other things.  And we were out on the beach and after it was all over, all of a sudden this Mexican 
[03:40:30]  dude comes up and slaps my boyfriend high five.  He had been sitting in a lawn chair watching the whole time.  Yeah.  It's a sad one.  He's like, oh, my God.  Nicole, what part of a good story did you think it was to skip all the details and go  to the high five?  I don't know.  Where are you?  I don't know.  I thought that was the funny, the badomch of the story.  I didn't tell you I was going to give you all the details.  We hooked up.  We're going to go play the hits now?  This is not that...  We could tell more details. 
[03:41:00]  No, we can't because I'm still Coley B from the mashup.  No, you're not right now.  I do not need to go into the details, but there was a threesome then.  A threesome?  Yeah, it was me, my boyfriend, and one of my girlfriends.  On the beach?  On the beach.  Outside.  Outside.  Was there penetration?  You could say that.  Yeah.  There was.  Now I'm going to go.  What hour of the day was it?  It was like 3 a.m.  And it was just that one Mexican guy on the beach?  All of a sudden, we didn't know until it was over.  Then we looked up.  He got up.  He slapped my boyfriend high five.  And we looked over.  He'd been sitting in a lawn chair watching the whole time.  We had no idea that he had this whole show going on. 
[03:41:30]  You knew he was there.  That's why you picked that spot.  No, that's not true at all.  Did you know the third person?  Yeah.  You didn't meet them on vacation?  It was somebody?  No, it was a girlfriend of mine, and it was someone I was dating.  Now, was the person you were dating, you said there was some penetration.  Oh, we're not moving at night.  Was there multiple?  Multiple penetration is all I asked.  You don't have to tell whose holes they were if there was just more than one.  Do you see me putting on my coat right now?  It's cold in here.  Don't even worry about it.  Eric's story was not nearly as good.  I think I gave you enough.  That's all you're getting.  If you want to hear the rest of the story, you can come see me in my office later. 
[03:42:00]  Did you, as Bobo would say, and this is just for Bobo, did you go deep sea diving?  Duh.  I'm leaving.  That's fantastic, Nicole.  Maybe you could tweet a little bit about it.  Thank you.  At Mashup Nicole.  Good day.  Yeah.  Mashup Nicole is your Twitter.  Follow us, by the way, at Mashup Rich, at Mashup Stanley T, and Mashup Ryan.  Just saying.  Don't plug Rich.  He didn't come in here.  He's got better things to do.  And yeah, talk to Ryan.  It was Mashup Ryan who brought up Chumlee.  Chumlee.  He's hilarious.  I'll see you later.  Thank you to the Morning Mashup, Stanley T, Ryan and Nicole. 
[03:42:30]  Now this is, see what this one's saying, Marjorie.  Opie always tells me to keep Nicole off the air because he's sick of her.  I think, and I get what he's saying, by the way.  Like, okay, I can't, I'm not going to argue that point.  But if I can get her to tell sexual stories, I say keep her coming in.  It's intriguing.  Absolutely.  I want to know if it hit her in the forehead or in the eye.  Okay, so what we know from that story is.  One of my uncles saw her.  That's what I was about to say.  It was one of your two uncles.  I didn't know which one.  My uncle's a dirty bastard, so it's probably my uncle. 
[03:43:00]  Your uncle just drunken on a beach going, yeah, Cerveza.  Just clapping his.  And then he passed down when he heard Eric's story.  It was boring.  You didn't think that was good?  No.  So what we know from that story is Nicole, she went to Acapulco.  She was on the beach.  It was like 3 a.m.  You know tequila was involved.  Oh, yeah.  They were drunk off their asses.  19-year-old Nicole.  Yeah, among other things.  Who knows what else was going on.  And there was a three-way with her friend, who's a female, her and her boyfriend. 
[03:43:30]  There was penetration.  And she went down on the girl.  That's what deep sea diving means to a retard like Bobo.  So now, Mars, do you think that the boyfriend got to penetrate both?  I think so.  I do, too.  That's right.  She wouldn't answer it.  That's right.  That's right.  Roland.  Not Roland.  Mars.  Yes, sir.  Your rule with a threesome is must penetrate both women.  Must penetrate both women.  Oh, yeah.  That was our old intern who said he had a threesome.  Yeah.  What was his name?  I forgot his name.  Whatever. 
[03:44:00]  One of the old ones.  Buck?  I don't know.  Occupy asshole.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he came in and said he had a threesome.  You said no way.  Because to you, a threesome has to have two people.  You have to penetrate two people.  Absolutely.  Now, if it's two guys and a girl and you're in the threesome, you would penetrate the guy  and the girl, correct?  That's not correct because I don't do trains.  No, no, no.  It's just like one after the other.  No, no.  Wrong, wrong.  Well, which one would you do?  Go another route.  Which one would you do first?  Wrong, wrong, wrong.  Go another route.  Which would you do first?  Move on, move on.  And would they both be asses? 
[03:44:30]  There's so many options.  I don't do that.  I don't do that.  You haven't done it?  I do not do that.  Have you?  We'll never do.  Oh.  That's very closed-minded of you.  But you have a scorpion.  More Scorpion Kings to give away.  I gave one away.  Oh.  I made a claim that all the lines hung up after you gave it away.  I know.  I didn't understand why.  I said that I didn't understand why you had, Roland, had left the overstock bin of Best  Buy on my console here to give away.  He doesn't get it. 
[03:45:00]  What overstock?  The Scorpion King is a shitty movie.  That's all I'm trying to get at here.  Nobody wants it.  Yeah, it's pretty bad.  Yeah, that's what I thought.  I mean, there's no way of publicists.  Are we trying to get Billy Zane in studio?  I don't think we have to worry about upsetting anybody.  I think the stamp is worth more than the movie.  Yeah.  There's still no calls coming, just so you know.  Yeah, well, I mean, I'm not even going to take them.  Michael Clark Duncan, though, was in here with Omarosa, as we talked about, and he came over,  and he shook everybody's hand. 
[03:45:30]  Hell of a gentleman.  Manly shake.  Manly shake.  He was in here at 7 o'clock in the morning.  And, I mean, we usually don't have guests that early, except stupid old man Buzz Aldrin came in at 6 o'clock in the morning one time at K-Rock.  Like, all I could do is 6 a.m.  That shouldn't even be an option.  But he was in at 7 a.m., Michael Clark Duncan was.  And his handshake, because I was over here next to Opie to video, and his handshake, like, I know I'm not the strongest human being.  No, really? 
[03:46:00]  Physically.  You could have surprised the fuck out of me.  Mentally, I am the strongest human being, but physically, I'm not the strongest.  I just, my hand was, like, I could feel the soreness in my hand for minutes after, like, halfway through the interview, I could still feel, my hand was still in pain from just a handshake.  Your hand disappears, because his hand's so huge.  Yeah, it just encompasses it, and then he just squeezes.  Oh, look, the Scorpion King callers.  I'm going to take one of these calls, because there's no way that the phone banks just filled up for Scorpion King. 
[03:46:30]  And if they did, then there's some major prize pigs that listen to the Opie and Anthony show, and after Opie and Anthony Live.  Yes, you're on the show after Opie and Anthony Live.  Hey, bu-bu-bu-bu boys.  What's up?  Do you really want the Scorpion King?  Yes, yes, I love the Scorpion King.  Would love to have a copy of it.  It's part three, and it's starring Billy Zane, Kimbo Slice, and WWE champion Batista. 
[03:47:00]  It's on Blu-ray.  It's on Blu-ray.  And Ron Perlman.  And Ron Perlman.  Well, Ron Perlman is good in Sons of Anarchy.  What were you going to say?  If you add a pizza and a six-pack of Pabst Blue Ribbon, that's a Friday night.  All right, well, then I'm going to put you on hold and give you something to do this weekend, okay?  Pabst Blue Ribbon.  Congratulations.  He's on line six, so you can take his information.  White people drink.  There's two people who drink.  Pabst Blue Ribbon? 
[03:47:30]  Yeah, Pabst Blue Ribbon.  It used to be, like, a white trash beer.  Right, it still is?  No, because then college kids started drinking it ironically.  So it's like a hipster beer now.  Oh.  Like, in college, you get it because it's funny and ironic.  Oh, look at me.  I got Pabst Blue Ribbon.  Yeah, it was big in college because it was also cheap, too.  Yeah, but it is.  And then you go and you move to Brooklyn and you get Pabst Blue Ribbon and you have parties on your roof.  Like, that's what the kids do.  Ew.  Why is that ew?  Because the beer sucks.  It does.  It's delicious.  Well, you think it's the alcohol. 
[03:48:00]  You just need to taste the alcohol.  You drink rubbing alcohol, you'll be all right.  Yeah.  As long as the alcohol touches these lips, I'm like.  Mars, you're, you, you train, well, you trained, you haven't, it doesn't look like you've been  training recently, but in your, in your prime, you couldn't take out a guy the size of Michael  Clark Duncan.  I'm still training.  You are?  Yes, I am.  For what?  Eating competitions?  You motherfucker.  Give Pat from Munaki a run for his money.  Hey, it was a Christmas vacation.  You indulged a little.  Yeah, a little bit.  A little bit.  Why not? 
[03:48:30]  That's a big dude.  Guys like that, you have to go, my size, a guy like that, I gotta go for a choke.  Gotta go for the neck, because arms, legs, everything else is so strong if you get hit.  So where you just jump on their back like a monkey and try to choke them out?  Yeah, you gotta do it.  You gotta try.  You can't take them down, like, by their legs and try to get them on the ground and do  it that way.  But once you're on the ground, you have the formidable task of getting past the legs and  the arms.  What type of task?  Formidable.  You got it that time.  Okay.  I mean, technically, it's formidable, not formidable, but you got it. 
[03:49:00]  I mean, that's close enough for you.  I'll give you that.  It's not like Poe's dating move.  Oh, Jesus.  You're talking about our old security guard now.  Yeah.  Okay.  I don't know what.  Oh, Jesus.  Again, with the accusations here.  More Scorpion King.  Nobody.  They don't want to pick up another call.  It's disgusting that you people are calling after Open Anthony Live to try to win the  Scorpion King.  No, they want to talk to you, Sam.  Is that all it is?  That's what they're all saying.  They just want to talk to Sam.  I just want to talk to Sam.  Walk down a random line. 
[03:49:30]  They all want to talk to you.  Go ahead, Sam.  Nine.  Roland.  I'll talk to Roland.  They talked to Iraq.  Iraq's not a chocolate guy.  He doesn't like desserts.  He loves sandwiches.  Did I say it right?  Yes.  Okay.  Hope it's.  Yeah.  But Roland, you're a guy who enjoys all types of food.  Yesterday on Ron and Fez, by the way, thank you to Ron and Fez for a great pizza party  for Roland.  And Mark Zio for it.  Yeah, it happened.  Okay.  It was at, uh, it happened yesterday afternoon on the Ron and Fez show. 
[03:50:00]  I mean, honestly, Mars, I'll tell you, it wasn't as good as it could have been.  It was a good pizza party.  The company was great.  Ron and Fez are great hosts.  Right.  But they left one of their producers in charge of actually getting the food.  And did he make the pizza?  No.  Well, Fez tried to make the pizza, but they went out and bought some after that.  It wasn't going to work.  Unfortunately, one of their producers went out and got mostly just cheese.  And it left a lot of people.  I was fine with it because I like cheese. 
[03:50:30]  Right.  But I'm not going to eat more than two slices.  Like, the rest of the people at the party were a little underwhelmed and dissatisfied,  to tell you the truth.  Because, I mean, they wanted a meat lover's pie.  You know what I mean?  Mm-hmm.  Like, Roland, he wanted something substantial on his pie, and unfortunately, it was mainly cheese.  Like, when I threw my pizza party, I had, like, four cheeses, but also I had 15 other meat pies.  Yeah.  I mean, nobody can discredit you for that.  At the end of the show today, we were talking about hostess going out of business.  Are you a hostess guy?  No.  You're not? 
[03:51:00]  I just like the crocodile.  It's like a hostess.  It's like a limited run they did.  The crocodile?  Yeah, it's a crocodile.  What is it?  It's like a chocolate.  It was like a Twinkie, but covered in chocolate.  You like that?  I love that.  It's delicious.  So your problem with hostess is...  Oh, and the swiggly?  The swiggly one?  So your problem...  Yes, I am sad.  Your problem with hostess is it's too good for you.  You need them to add, like, some kind of chocolate or some kind of thing to it.  It's delicious.  I understand.  And your voice, I hear, is still going.  Is that side effects from the TV smashing? 
[03:51:30]  Did you say crocodiles?  Yeah.  Chocodiles.  Chocodiles.  I was about to say, why do you call them crocodiles?  Okay, chocodiles.  I'm looking at the picture now that Mars pulled up, and it is.  It's just a chocolate-covered Twinkie.  So you...  Twinkies aren't good enough.  You need them to be chocolate-covered.  I love chocolate.  E-Rock, this wouldn't be in your ballpark.  No, not at all.  You like a Twinkie, though?  I haven't eaten Twinkies in so long.  I just remembered that they were so sweet, like, you could feel the sugar on your teeth.  What if I put a Twinkie between a couple pieces of bread? 
[03:52:00]  Then you have yourself...  No.  No?  It'll be gone.  Yeah, it'll be gone.  It's a sandwich.  Mars.  Sir.  Snack foods.  Hostess?  No.  Not at all.  I don't like these sweets, no.  You don't like them, because they do bad things to your body, but you like the way they  taste.  Yeah, they do.  Yeah.  You guys stay with them.  It's a weakness.  Yeah.  But I'm like with...  I'm like E-Rock.  They have no chocolate.  Just sandwiches.  Lots and lots and lots of sandwiches.  Lots of meat.  Lots of meat.  And burritos. 
[03:52:30]  Is it burritos?  Is that what they call it?  No, sucker.  Rice and beans.  Did you call him a sucker?  Yeah.  That's like one of those...  Mars thought he had a better name to call E-Rock in his head, but as the sentence came  out, sucker was all poured out of his mouth.  So he said, no sucker.  No my little lollipop.  Were you insulted, Eric, that he called you a sucker?  That we went back to the streets of 1980s?  Yeah.  And Omarosa, by the way, you would describe her as a sister, correct?  Yes.  As a sister, as we learned yesterday.  But chocolates are delicious, though.  If you get the right, like a chocolatier, like a Jock Torres, or for Sweden, it's phenomenal. 
[03:53:00]  Or a box of Hostess chocolate-covered Twinkies.  No, but like real chocolate is so good.  I mean, I've heard good things about chocolate.  But I'm sure that many people enjoy it.  Opie wanted me to...  Wanted to stay around here.  For the Scorpion King.  No, not for the stupid Scorpion King Blu-rays.  I have tons of them.  But he was willing to wait up to four minutes.  The intern, Sal, came out and said, you're on in five minutes, Sam. 
[03:53:30]  And he ruined the whole thing.  But he wanted to confront you.  Yes, he did.  About toys and bread?  Yeah, he wanted to know how we religiously celebrate a certain part of Christmas.  But he got the wrong group.  Yeah.  He thinks I'm Mexican.  Aren't you?  No, I'm not.  Well, they get a green, red.  The bread's different colors.  You open it, and there's a little baby.  A little baby?  Yeah.  Inside the bread?  With toys, yeah.  What kind of a baby?  Like a human? 
[03:54:00]  No.  It's Cyclops.  It's like a little toy.  It's not a Cyclops?  Do the eyes, do the two eyes on the head kind of join together once you're baked into  a loaf of bread?  If it's a bad baker, it's overheated.  Whoa!  Ron Bennington.  The great Ron Bennington.  Hi, Mr. Bennington.  Oh, it's good to see everybody.  We were just actually talking about the big pizza party from yesterday. 
[03:54:30]  Just wanted to apologize for the amount of cheese that was brought in.  It was just so much.  Fucking nightmare.  I was telling Mars that, like, the party itself was great.  You and Fez are fantastic hosts.  You make everybody feel comfortable.  Everybody has a good time.  Well, thank you.  It's nice.  But some people left hungry.  Because they were just not satisfied.  It's one of those mistakes, and Fez is never going to let that happen again.  He counted on somebody else.  Yeah.  And I'm disappointed that Fez, you know, is a star of the show.  Look at the banner.  His name is on it. 
[03:55:00]  He's the guy.  That is true.  I never even saw that.  Yeah, it's right there.  It's my name.  They put both of them up there.  That's nice.  But he's the guy who has to order the pizzas because he can't, what, he can't count on  people?  Well, you know, Mark does one of those things where, and God bless him.  Yeah.  But he's like, how can I use this show, this platform, to push myself along?  Is that what it is?  Yeah.  He's the type of guy that you ever hear, like, he'll dive on a grenade for you?  He would push Fez on a grenade for himself. 
[03:55:30]  And that's what seems to have happened.  God bless him.  Yeah, God bless him.  God bless him.  But he would, if it were up to, like, if the company said, look, Zito, we can only keep  you or Fez, he wouldn't say, like, what is good for the show, what's good for the  fans, what does Ron want?  He'd go, get Fez the fuck out of here.  Right.  How does this help me?  That's awful.  Well, I just want everybody in the room to say my last name.  Why don't we start with you, Marcy?  Bennington.  Yeah.  He says my name like a black person, Roland. 
[03:56:00]  Black people cannot say my last name.  There's a lot of N's in there.  Hey!  Oh, whoa!  A little wordplay!  Watch out!  I know the after show's pretty edgy.  Yeah.  I don't fall into that game, though, but I prefer African-Americans.  Okay.  Did you see the Scorpion King part three?  I didn't know.  I didn't know.  Roland actually gave me 400 copies of it because he can't pawn them off on anybody as a giveaway. 
[03:56:30]  Do you want a copy?  I want a copy if it's signed by you and Roland, and then I will give it out on my show today.  We will sign that for you.  Yeah.  Sign it up.  That's a huge...  That's a little value.  How did you like your big guests today?  Which one?  Michael Clark Duncan.  He was great with Omarosa in here.  Mm-hmm.  He was great.  I mean, and he was very open to...  He could talk about his project that was going on now.  Yeah.  But then he also talked about being homeless and working as a security guard for Biggie.  Yeah.  And, you know, all that stuff. 
[03:57:00]  He's a big, big story.  Yeah.  And I remember when he broke in, everybody was, like, crazy about him.  And I honestly expected his career to go more.  I thought he was going to be, like, the star of the show.  Right.  But, you know, character actor is pretty cool, too.  Yeah.  And, I mean, yeah, well, I think that's because The Green Mile was huge.  And so it was like everybody just...  Why do you forget about Armageddon?  Why is that one of those films that...  Well, because...  The Green Mile...  But The Green Mile was bigger than Armageddon.  And then he kind of...  You know what?  I want to check on this.  I want to check the numbers.  Box office is Armageddon.  I'm going to say Armageddon's bigger. 
[03:57:30]  Box office.  But, I mean...  That's all I care about.  I'm a money guy.  I'm a money guy.  You're a box office guy.  Look, Benetton got to get paid.  Benetton.  Benetton needs to be paid.  That is how Mars says it.  It's awful.  It's really awful.  You know he can't speak Spanish either, Mars.  I didn't know that about you.  You didn't know?  Yeah.  Oh, you can't.  Well, I told the guys.  That's what New York Ricans do.  We fuck up both languages.  So you were born here in New York.  Yes, sir.  I would have lost money on that.  Yeah.  I would have lost money.  I thought you were diving for fucking coins off a cruise ship down there in Puerto Rico 
[03:58:00]  growing up, like never going to school.  And there's just like, after a while you throw a banana in the water and they dive in  after it.  Everybody's laughing and high-fiving.  You've heard the Spanglish before when people refer to themselves as speaking Spanglish.  Yes.  I speak Span-English.  Mars says Span-English.  Oh, Jesus.  So he can't even get the slang.  I mean, it's a real...  Where were you born?  Span-English, Harlem, Mars?  Upper West Side.  Washington Heights.  Way Upper West. 
[03:58:30]  You know, that's the funny thing is white people never call that the Upper West Side.  No, they don't.  White people stop the Upper West Side at about 96th Street.  That's like, oh, shit.  Yeah.  Shit, I just crossed 96th.  Turn around.  But to Mars, that's Upper West Side.  Upper West.  That's right, baby.  Yeah.  There's a...  Yeah.  Sometimes Harlem, Upper West Side, they're kind of interchangeable.  Inward.  Yeah.  Um, and we also had the, uh, not only one of the directors from the Paradise Lost documentaries,  but one of the kids, the West Memphis Three.  He's not a kid anymore, but... 
[03:59:00]  Which one?  Uh, Jason Baldwin.  He was the really kind of charismatic black-haired kid.  No, that's Damien.  So Damien's the one who did it.  And then Jason...  Trust me, I know people in Memphis, these fucking...  They killed these little kids.  And you got that from the people in Memphis.  I know people who know people.  Okay.  That's the thing.  Okay.  They killed these little kids while they're fucking blasting Metallica and just stabbing  the shit out of them, which I think is, you know...  Is it...  And, you know, with the people you talked to, was it the music that led them to it? 
[03:59:30]  Yes, it is.  Anybody who listens to heavy metal music is a devil-worshipping kid killer.  That's why I'm...  ...in Memphis.  I know people who know people.  Okay.  That's the thing.  Okay.  They killed these little kids while they're fucking blasting Metallica and just stabbing the shit  out of them, which I think is, you know...  Is it...  And, you know, with the people you talked to, was it the music that led them to it?  Yes, it is.  Anybody who listens to heavy metal music is a devil-worshipping kid killer.  That's why I moved over to hip-hop early on in my youth, because I didn't want to... 
[04:00:00]  That's smart.  I didn't want to get mixed up and all that.  I didn't want to smoke and crack and shooting people, and it's great.  It's black magic stuff.  Racist.  It's not the black magic I meant.  Did you watch the documentary?  I haven't seen the third one yet.  I didn't get a preview copy, but I've seen the first two.  It's really humiliating how they finally let them out of jail.  Yeah.  It was like they had to say, we did it, and let us go.  They're still convicted killers.  Yeah.  And it's like they won't just give it to them.  And I hope Anthony or Jim was saying that they even said, yeah, you're going to... 
[04:00:30]  We have to plead to this, so, you know, because otherwise you could end up suing us or something.  Yeah, it was all about money.  Yeah.  It was all about money because, obviously, the state owes them money.  They took 18 years, over 18 years of their lives, and Jason was in here.  There's three of them.  I always get confused with the names.  It doesn't matter.  Jason was in here, and he was talking about just the experience of he's 16, and it's his  last day of school.  And he's thinking, all right, I'm going to go get a job at the grocery store. 
[04:01:00]  Then I'm going to get my license, and my neighbor's going to teach me how to drive.  Like, you all know the feeling of the last day of school.  And that's the day that the cops came and locked him up for the next 18 years.  Did the guys ask, what is it like when you're taking a little boy's life?  And that last breath.  I mean, do you wish that you didn't do it?  Have you seen the films or just read the Memphis stuff?  What I did was just listen to Metallica, and I fucking feel like I picked up the story from there.  You figured out, yeah.  I should give him the Scorpion King Blu-ray.  Do you want? 
[04:01:30]  I forget.  Did you see that we have Scorpion King things?  Yeah, did you give one to the Jason, this is our way of making it up to you?  Yeah.  Just sit and watch it.  Who's in this one?  Well, this one.  I know, you know, The Rock and all that.  This one is starring Billy Zane.  You may remember from a little film called Titanic.  Yeah, very familiar.  He was the bad guy in Titanic.  And Phantom.  No one ever brings up the film Phantom.  Nobody brings that up.  It's a hell of a ride.  Kimbo Slice, you may remember from mixed martial arts until the guy with the pink hair beat him out of his career.  And former wrestler Batista. 
[04:02:00]  He's not a wrestler anymore?  No.  He left to do films, to pursue his dream of becoming a major actor.  You know, during my show today, Sam, I want you to stop back in because I have a wrestling tape I want to go over with you.  What is it?  I just feel like the sport has changed a lot, and there's a little something that we've seen.  Is it new?  I don't know.  They seem like they're younger guys.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  And I just want you to explain to us what's happened to wrestling over the years. 
[04:02:30]  Okay, because there was something that, if we're talking about that, maybe I'll tell you off the air so as to not spoil anything.  But there's a clip from this Monday, actually, that I would also like to get Fez's opinion on.  Great.  We can do them both then.  Yeah.  We'll make it like a little wrestling time.  A little wrestling segment.  We'll tell everybody in advance so they don't get upset and insist on turning off the air.  As long as Dave's time doesn't get moved, I'm fine.  That's all I'm talking about.  Look, we were talking about the week.  Where was E-Rock at the party yesterday?  This is what Ron does, by the way.  He brings up. 
[04:03:00]  He did this four times yesterday.  He says, as long as Dave's time doesn't get moved.  And before I can explain that I'm not.  You better point out what happens, Sam.  Just go with it.  Just go.  Just keep moving.  Yeah, there's the river is moving.  And then we wait until that one guy calls up again and goes, fuck you, Sam.  You're destroying Dave's dreams.  And then after the Scorpion King.  And then we'll give him a Scorpion King.  You're seriously a good impressionist now.  I mean, you sound just like that guy.  I'm trying to do voices.  So what happened to E-Rock?  That's actually a good question. 
[04:03:30]  I'm packing to move, so I went home to get stuff done.  And you had to miss the big pizza party.  Well, I hope you're going to be there for Taco Fest.  Taco Fest is not until Roland Book's another guest, though.  Roland, are you sniffing around for the next big one?  What about Bob Hope?  What's he doing?  You got any fucking connections there?  Jesus?  I'll do Jesus in a heartbeat.  Jesus would be a great en masse, but you might need to do a two-parter.  As long as it's not baby Jesus.  I've got to give him later on.  You know, speaking of baby Jesus, that's Talladega Nights. 
[04:04:00]  That's another connection to Michael Clark Duncan.  I like your little segues that you do, Rob.  I forgot that he was in that.  Yeah.  Oh, A-Rex is whispering in my ear.  He wants to get to the bottom of this Green Mile-Armageddon box office debate.  Oh, good.  Let's do it.  Green Mile made $136 million.  $136?  It's going to be tough to beat, Ron.  Armageddon made $201 million.  He did it.  He did it.  Now, I still would think that Green Mile was probably better for his career, but you go numbers.  It was...  Armageddon was the biggest film of that year. 
[04:04:30]  By far.  And it was one of the few believable films I've ever seen.  Because an asteroid's coming to Earth, so they get these wildcat guys.  They put them on a spaceship, on a rocket, shoot them to the asteroid, and then have them blow it up.  And you say...  These guys have never been in space before.  Never before?  No.  Wow.  Is this Ben Affleck's finest work, or...?  It's one of his, yes, and...  Little known fact, here you go, Aerosmith.  Great.  This song, the only number one hit of Aerosmith's career. 
[04:05:00]  Is this...  The only number one single they have ever had, yeah.  Did Diane Warren write it?  Diane Warren did write it.  This is why Rowling gets pizza parties, and that's Sam, who's walking around here, not understanding him, you know, quite frankly, pushing Dave out of the way.  Now, we're moving on.  Okay, you're right.  We're moving on.  I don't want to harp on these issues that are factual.  Now, when this song played, we realized Bruce Willis was dead, and his daughter was getting married to Ben Affleck, and they had a picture of Bruce Willis there. 
[04:05:30]  I don't know if you at home realize what's going on, but we're actually witnessing the unmasking of the film, Armageddon, right now.  Mars is even crying a little bit, just remembering that scene, because all you ever want to do in life is save the guy...  Yeah.  ...that your daughter's going to marry while you die, and then the rest of your life, you're like, no one can ever measure up to you.  Of course not.  Ultimate sacrifice.  Yeah. 
[04:06:00]  Mars, I know that there were some language barriers, but did you get the emotional complexity of Armageddon?  I think I did.  You did?  You understood what was going on?  He has a language barrier with Sesame Street.  He had to lean over and said, what's this three they talk about?  Well, I mean, the song is beautiful.  What was the country act that did this song?  I believe that was Johnny Cash in his later years when he was all gruff.  You're right.  Didn't somebody else do this song?  Probably somebody on that fucking show you watch, that Idol show. 
[04:06:30]  I'm fucking hang out.  Well, I'm sure somebody's done this song on American Idol before.  Do you think...  I don't know if you heard us talking about it before.  Do you think Omarosa, other than the Jersey Shore kids, those are a different league, is the biggest reality star who's only a reality star?  No, I would have said it to the initial naked gay guy who won Survivor.  Richard Hatch.  Richard Hatch.  No one got as big as him.  He's never done jack shit besides it.  Well, he beat up his kid or something.  He did something to his kid.  Yeah, but that was his personal life.  I mean, he never turned it in. 
[04:07:00]  He refused to pay his taxes.  He's in jail right now.  I'm keeping the million.  You said I could have a million.  It's a million.  Right.  But the beauty of him is, like, if you were ever to start talking about reality,  he was, like, the first big guy on network TV.  Yeah.  So you can't beat first.  You know what I mean?  You can't...  Maybe you're right.  It's like the Elvis thing.  Like, if you ever talk about who's the greatest, Will Elvis.  Well, because he was first.  He was first.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And Survivor started everything for network reality shows. 
[04:07:30]  Real World, though.  Real World wasn't networked, though.  It was MTV.  And it wasn't...  It was very big, but...  It wasn't competition reality.  Survivor started the competition reality trend.  Was it Fear of Factor before?  It wasn't, like, a reality show, though.  It wasn't episodic.  That's a game show.  Fear of Factor is a game show.  Different cast every week.  Because you're not staying with them.  No.  No.  I would say that's the difference.  Was Big Brother before or after?  Like, maybe it came the following year after Survivor.  I think Big Brother was after Survivor. 
[04:08:00]  Yeah, because the same network.  It was a CBS show.  Yeah, the same network.  And they were...  That's when...  Yeah, I think that was the start of the reality ball rolling,  of just, like, replacing all scripted shows.  They're starting to bring them back,  but for a while, it was all reality shows  because they were cheap.  Well, the weird thing is,  you think because they were cheap,  they would go to cable more.  But cable really has the better shows now.  Yeah, absolutely.  I mean...  USA.  Like, FX has better shows than any network. 
[04:08:30]  And, I mean, if you even look at Showtime and HBO,  they're better than network shows.  Yeah, absolutely.  Even USA has Royal Pains, White Collar, Suits.  USA actually has stepped their game up huge.  My problem is, every time I turn on that network,  I just start chanting USA,  and I fucking take a flag out.  And you just keep conscious right on what's going on in the show.  And then, all of a sudden, the show's over.  Although, USA, the only thing they broadcast,  aside from three original shows,  is either Law & Order, SVU, or CSI.  That's plenty for me. 
[04:09:00]  Those are the only shows.  That's plenty for me.  And it's like, I'll turn on the TV and go,  I didn't know there was a Law & Order SVU marathon on today,  because it's on every other day.  Right.  Like, that's all they broadcast.  How many episodes of this show?  But, yes.  So, the taco party is happening.  Well, we'll see.  It seems like Roland caught a lucky fucking wave there  with Stephen Merchant.  Oh, you don't think it was a skill thing?  Oh, no.  I think he just happened to be right place at the right time.  Like, Stephen Merchant said,  Hey, Roland, I want to do O&A. 
[04:09:30]  And Roland said, Okay.  And then he goes, Hey, I got an extra hour.  Is there anything else going on?  Exactly.  Exactly what happened there.  That's why he was so itchy on the Bob Hope thing.  But, yeah.  See, here's the thing about Roland.  And I'm going to take this to Wall Street now.  Mm-hmm.  This is the fucking airline.  His dad worked for the airline.  So, he knew that one thing.  He was able to get in with it.  I got you.  But then he didn't have jack shit.  Roland now needs to break into other offices,  go through their files,  to book the next big guest.  Or he needs to just expose everything 
[04:10:00]  and try to get immunity for it.  Oh, I like the immunity idol.  You know, back to Survivor.  Taking it back to Survivor.  Back to Survivor.  Well, wrestling talk on Running Fest.  Yeah, we're going to bring you in.  And once we get going,  you'll be down in the office  because you never go home, right?  I don't go home.  I set up a cot under the desk  because I'm small, too.  So, no, I don't ever leave.  Okay.  So, we'll definitely bring you back in.  We'll go over it.  You've got a tape you want us to look at.  Yeah.  We've got one we want you to look at. 
[04:10:30]  This is huge.  It is.  Coming up later today  on the Opie and Anthony channel.  How come you're not doing  an all-wrestling show on the weekends?  I've thought about it before,  but I would do it.  Like, I would do one with Fez  because then you got the two  kind of personalities or whatever.  I would maybe do only once a month  or something before pay-per-views,  like specials.  There's a wrestling show on Sirius  between the two of us.  It's terrible. 
[04:11:00]  Yeah.  There's never been a good wrestling show.  No.  Let's admit that.  No, there hasn't.  I think I could do a good wrestling show.  I think that you and Fez  could probably be the carton boomer  of the wrestling world.  Of pro wrestling.  Yeah.  The reason there's never a good wrestling show  is because every person  who's ever done a wrestling show  treats it like sports radio.  Right.  Like, where they're reporting  on the results,  and it's like,  that's not wrestling.  Like, a wrestling show,  you should just go on  and talk about who your favorite  tag team ever was or something.  And just because you're talking  about wrestling,  you don't have to sound gruff. 
[04:11:30]  Let me tell you something.  You don't need a character.  You're talking about...  Get off my phone, jabroni.  No.  Just a person.  Mark Zito was Googling Wisconsin.  Big fan.  Mark Zito was Googling Wisconsin.  Big fan?  Yes.  I don't even know what that means.  Is that a reference?  I'm not understanding.  The cheese.  Oh, oh.  Roland said,  because the cheese.  Oh, okay.  Well, we'll end on that.  Who's laughing in the hall?  I think that was UCB Fred, actually.  Okay, so...  He was fucking losing it out there.  And he's a level 45 improver, 
[04:12:00]  so he knows jokes.  All right, coming up next,  Benetton and Watley.  Stay tuned for Ron and Fez.  This...  After Open Anthony Live  and ONA will continue tomorrow.  Bye.  Bye. </pre>
