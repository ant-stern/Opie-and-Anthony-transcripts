<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The January 5th, 2009, Opie and Anthony Show began with the hosts returning from a two-week break. Opie announced he’d lost his wedding ring, leading to a discussion about marriage and tattoos.  They then launched into a scathing critique of Dick Clark’s New Year’s Eve broadcast, playing numerous audio clips showcasing Clark’s apparently slurred and confused speech, contrasting this with the fawning responses from Ryan Seacrest and Kelly Pickler.  This segued into a broader discussion about the decline of television quality and the rise of cheap reality TV.  A caller offered an inappropriate greeting.  The hosts continued dissecting Dick Clark's performance,  mentioned Pat Hingle's death and Brett Favre's retirement, and discussed Anthony's recent speeding ticket and the Jonas Brothers' promise rings. Opie shared an embarrassing sleep-related anecdote, and they played a game called "Make That Duty," a variation of "Name That Tune."

The show then shifted to a critical review of Robbie Knievel’s motorcycle jump, comparing it unfavorably to his father's stunts. They analyzed a video of the jump, highlighting its perceived lack of danger and excessive hype. The discussion continued with the NFL playoffs, the hosts’ team loyalties, and the NHL Winter Classic.  They also debated college sports and the over-involvement of alumni.  Further commentary on Knievel's jump and the "jump the shark" trope concluded this section. A later segment focused heavily on comparing Robbie Knievel's New Year's Eve jump to a jump by Robbie Madison, which the hosts and callers overwhelmingly preferred, using vulgar language to describe Knievel's jump as “embarrassing” and “a chump.”  Callers added details, including injuries sustained by Madison (broken hands) and a report that Knievel injured his thumb.

A humorous rant about the Snuggie infomercial followed, with callers sharing anecdotes of ordering difficulties and upselling tactics, and the hosts mocking the product and its marketing with offensive language.  Anthony then detailed his disastrous Christmas vacation: a severe hangover leading him to miss his own party, a fall on ice resulting in injury, and an unfair speeding ticket.  They briefly discussed Anthony's upcoming comedy shows and a scheduling conflict,  jokingly commented on Al Pacino’s wigs, and expressed their dislike for the movie *Wall-E*. Anthony's late Christmas gift, an HD Flip camera, was mentioned.

A subsequent segment featured discussions about a new iPhone-compatible camera, Kenny's exorbitant “handler's fees,” the lack of credible photographic evidence for UFOs, Bigfoot, and the Loch Ness Monster, and a detailed recounting of a Papa John's pizza order from Iraq placed at the studio on December 28th, 2008, including specific toppings and dipping sauces.  Iraq’s presence in the studio was confirmed, leading to a discussion about tipping delivery drivers.  Jimmy received old comedy show ticket stubs, prompting discussions about various comedians. Opie received a helmet as a gift.  The hosts also discussed Opie’s interest in firearms, a news story about a shooting in a movie theater, and  *The Curious Case of Benjamin Button*,  *Marley & Me*, *Valkyrie*, *Yes Man*, and *Caddyshack*.  They recalled a past chicken-throwing stunt, teasing and then playing a recording of the segment.

The final segment was a retrospective of the chicken-throwing bit.  Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy listened to a recording of the event, discussing its logistical challenges and mishaps, the chicken’s resilience, and the difficulty in timing the throw.  The hosts described the chicken as “big,” “ugly,” and “fat.”  Brian, the intern, was mentioned as the chicken's procurer.  Listener calls added to the comedic commentary.  The hosts acknowledged the bit's failure, but continued the humorous discussion with further listener calls, casually mentioning other past segments and jokes at their expense.

[00:39:00]  uh embarrassing right right christmas eve i took a little uh a little ice a little ice got under  foot we'll get into that next opian anthony  you're checking out the opian anthony show i'm kind of bummed i'm a fan without a football team right  now giants after giants just because we live in new york i gotta go big blue now f big blue  i'm not gonna i'm not i'm not gonna be one of these uh bandwagon dudes i could jump on the local 
[00:39:30]  bandwagon so wow no i could i could follow another team but when you're a jets fan that's sacrilege when  your jets are out of it then you go well i'll i'll be rooting for big blue when the mets are out of it i  don't jump and start rooting for the yankees when the islanders are knocked out with half a season ago  i don't start rooting for the rangers dude i'm not talking about wearing the jerseys and going to the  game no and and uh wearing pom-poms and stuff like that it's just like yeah you watch the game 
[00:40:00]  it gives a little more interest in the game if if it's a new york team that's all you're not a  football fan that's all i'm trying to say no i'm not all right what team would you follow though the  jets or the giants giants i would but would you really even that i'm not like you know  i could i could really give a crap if they uh uh win or not but it makes the game a little  more exciting than watching a couple of teams i really don't care about what team should i root for  now i told you that brett farb was going to have the big collapse at the end of the year i had no  doubt about that now watch he's definitely going to retire he's hinting that he's going to retire 
[00:40:30]  he's going to go back to green bay he's going to sit out a few years sit out he's going to just hang  out for a few years and then he's going to go into the the hall of fame as a as a packer just like i  said you're half philly now so you can be an eagles fan nope no no well i'll tell you what happened  so the jets are knocked out then i'm saying you know what peyton manning he was on a show he was a  cool dude i kind of i'm gonna was he in a loose mood he was he was a little loose i'm going you  know what i think i'm gonna like push for the colts this year what the hell yeah i need a team 
[00:41:00]  and they get knocked out by the chargers and then i'm like you know what this is where the philly  thing comes into play by the way my in-laws a bunch of them are into the dolphins why pretty much born  and raised in philly but for some reason you know how this happens like our our old pal uh uh  joey paisano yeah he is as new york as new york gets but he's a uh eagles fan yeah because when  you're a little kid all of a sudden maybe your dad throws a jersey at you next thing you know you're  like a fan for life for the for that team so but uh a lot of the philly crew they actually like the 
[00:41:30]  dolphins not the eagles so i'm like you know what chad pennington i was a big fan of his i'm going  dolphins now yes he has four interceptions and they're out so i'm i'm a fan without a team right  now well you could since dick clark was so courageous and quarterback for the cowboys  wow i said it before romo's a bum he's not a big game quarterback he's terrible i didn't watch the  game i was away that was uh what happened to the cowboys i don't even know i know they're out four 
[00:42:00]  to six just destroyed it was really yeah it was it was embarrassing yeah really what day was that on  sunday uh a week ago yesterday right right okay oh that sucks yeah so we're not gonna no playoff  appearance who's who's left you got the giants you got the eagles the thing is you oh my god wait the  giants are playing the eagles right uh yeah i gotta go eagle you can't but i don't care those dirty  eagles huh giants got home field too i can't root giants ever because i'm a jets fan it's just how it's 
[00:42:30]  just how i roll with my team resident football expert travis who's left i need a team here trying  to act manly right so he knows a lot about football let me when uh let me bond with travis a little  bit outdoor hockey how cool was that that was great holy ass why aren't they doing more of those  games every year one one lousy game you don't know the winner what did they call it the winter  winter classic the winter classic they started a few years back one hockey game a year they play  outdoors in hawaii i was gonna say it's gotta because who's watching this dude everybody's 
[00:43:00]  watching it it's like the biggest ratings for hockey in 13 years no i mean on tv it's fine but who's  going oh oh my they said it was the hottest ticket this year they did in wrigley field hottest ticket  in chicago sports history or something like that was it something like that the demand for tickets  was it cold it was ridiculous but it it's you gotta like you know google image this thing because  all of a sudden you got a hockey rink in the middle of wrigley field and it's cool it's it's awesome i 
[00:43:30]  want to go to one of those so bad but they should do more than one a year and i know if they do uh too  many that it's not special anymore one year and they played it in buffalo and there's a blizzard as  you're playing hockey basically how cool is that it looks awesome and they should also put some some  seats closer to the rink yeah i think oh what is it just in the middle and then there's field and  then the seats yeah kind of it's a little odd it's awful yeah it was because they don't have that  figured out but there's a picture of outdoor hockey at wrigley field the winter classic yeah you can't 
[00:44:00]  get right up against the boards and start banging on the board wait that's not that's not uh wrigley  field that's last year yeah that's buffalo when they played uh yeah because wrigley field they did  figure out they they set up some bleachers close to the rink yeah like it's like a high school uh  hockey game or something and then the rest of them were in the stadium that's great though yeah  dude it's and it was it was uh who was it was the blackhawks and uh and the red wings i could care 
[00:44:30]  less about either team but i watched the whole game because it was outdoors very cool sounds cold  it's very cold i like things like that i don't like going to fly i don't like going to football games  yeah i don't wait well is this the third year third year uh i hate the cold no they didn't they  did one before buffalo and they did it i think the first one they did they basically did it it  looked almost like it was on a lake or something they got really crazy with this thing i'm skin on  thin ice that'd be fun no i wasn't on a lake a hockey player just yeah right so like the omen too 
[00:45:00]  there's a kid under there imagine uh so what team am i following well you're definitely following  the ravens because that's who i'm following the ravens who else is in it i knew uh well you've got  baltimore against tennessee next week oh tennessee you know you've got the giants equals which are  uh pittsburgh san diego pittsburgh against who san diego san diego yeah and that's one more match up  out there and then you got um well bill cowher has joaquin phoenix lip so you gotta kind of root for 
[00:45:30]  them bill cowher's cbs studio analysis analyst and he's saying no to the jets job he doesn't  want anything to do with this jets team no and they should not have fired mangini dopes they  should not have fired mangini he was he was stuck with this brett farve it was a disaster well it's  his responsibility he should he should have been able to continue when you watch out and z you watch  i you know save this tape mangini's gonna go on and be very successful somewhere else very 
[00:46:00]  successful stupid jets just stick with your guys for a few years two years three years and then they  got to find someone new that was such a uh choke though i mean because of brett farve bro  did i just say yeah yeah yeah wow that crap right ahead so what's the other uh arizona  uh yeah cardinals yeah yeah i don't i don't know yeah oh yeah carolina yeah arizona carolina 
[00:46:30]  who are you gonna follow i i would rather stealers i guess pittsburgh uh i don't like the giants but i  hate philadelphia so i of those two i'd rather see the giants win um not i but that's okay for you  because you're not a jets fan no to me i you should never giants jets doesn't matter to me i will i  i have problems rooting for a team that's hurt my team so i don't want to see the giants win it at  all but all of those two i hate the giants less yeah i never root for a team that's killed my team 
[00:47:00]  though there's people that that follow that logic completely opposite that is like well you know  they beat my team so i got to respect them and now i don't have that phony that stupid that that fat  guy got code of honor code you know what you gotta take tip your cap why don't you tip some arsenic  into your mouth you fat suburban idiot nice nice very good you know what dude you gotta hand it to  him yeah what do you gotta hand to him nothing they were the better team oh yeah you're like real code 
[00:47:30]  of valor there you're shoving cheetos into your mouth quiet you're following baltimore yeah well i was born  in baltimore so i'm an oreo fan and a ravens fan that's wonderful you're all over the place shut  out wonderfully for you born in baltimore you're here in new york now you follow canadian teams  i follow one yeah it was very cold up there wait so you're a baltimore oils fan yeah ravens fan canadians

[00:48:30]  it was it it'll it'll make a grown man cry yeah when i lived in buffalo it was so cold you you  started crying there's like this is insane way a human is supposed to be in that kind of cold i  don't know how they do it that's ridiculous what are you gonna have they do i don't know why you did  it once you man up and say no we're not going to that dump that is fun when christmas or something  you know it's not fun it's not fun it's a great town city no i guess it is when it's warm but it 
[00:49:00]  only gets warm from june to august horribly cold all right listen uh jeff from staten island  hope your dog froze no he had a great time damn it yeah it's that nice it would be great if they  left the door the door ajar and they're like dexter and they find this frozen thing on its side  just solid all the way through yeah oh fantastic like a woolly mammoth they discover 
[00:49:30]  the meat is still fresh like they thought dexter out his eyes actually blink once more  you know i i got him a year ago today oh that's so wonderful i know cool what a great year it seems  so much longer hey jeff from stat island uh just uh making my point thank you uh jeff perfect example  of the jets effing up with their head coach they fired p uh carroll years ago remember p carroll  and uh now he just dominates uh college football basically curved huh usc some people are how 
[00:50:00]  football is is great i know but gators will win the national title dude i could not even i i could  fake it with with nfl i could fake no college football college some people know every goddamn  school where they are i don't know where these schools are way too many teams for me  there's too many start getting letters just look at the letters don't even let you know what the  yeah man you see aql this week i'm like what where is that but the first name of the team name 
[00:50:30]  gives away where they're from does it florida gators right well that i know all right but that's like the  only one i know oh i don't know things like like i didn't know where clemson was i don't know that  yeah that's a good uh bit clemson where is that i would guess georgia now clemson is actually in  canadian northern can i know texas a and m yes the longhorns i know the longhorns that's texas tech 
[00:51:00]  yeah texas just texas yes there's too many teams in one state then there's texas tech i know i just  said texas tech they're the red raiders are they who who can keep track all the way too many teams  stupid i listen to ron and fez and they're rattling these things off like everyone knows it right well  you don't want to get that deep into it but it's fun to watch a college football game because they a  lot of scoring a lot of uh crazy crazy plays a lot of flea flickers flea flicker they're 
[00:51:30]  they're they're big fans of the flea flicker in college football the option when the option  right the jets doing that the last play of the game oh that's that's hysterical that ball was  flying around the field i love like the whole year comes down to that one last play and they just look  ridiculous like you're like you take it no you take it like no you take it like you're playing with  your friends in sixth grade that's what it turns out to be far doesn't even line up for the play either 
[00:52:00]  he stinks i told everybody the uh he had a great career but we didn't need him to die half the real  jets fans didn't want him you dopes that bought the jerseys stop buying the myth the guy was old  that's why he wasn't playing for green bay anymore can i tell you something about college sports  people get involved with their alma matas and and i hate adults that are involved in their college  life yes let it go and wear the and wear the college colors but yeah they have to donate money for  a new wing and they want to know what's going on in the school just let it go go away from it 
[00:52:30]  stop being involved with younger people what's wrong with that every good point wow in certain  circumstances it's fine yeah yeah let me let me amend that stop being involved with your with  college students that have nothing let it go yeah that's where i went to school who cares  doesn't matter it's awful yeah who cares i'm rooting for my alma mater uh well so i'm a fan without a  effing football we're all gonna root for the ravens but i don't care about any of these teams like i 
[00:53:00]  sort of cared because of the the fish thing with the connection i have and chad pennington got a  connection with me i would have i would have went for the cowboys just because i know jimmy at this  point you know me if what they had a command playing quarterback romo oh boy he's a choke he's an  absolute choke to me a big a big b with a lot of yeah i'll go for whoever wins the uh giants uh  eagles game really yeah then that that's who i'll pick giants yeah i think it's gonna be the giants 
[00:53:30]  yeah i'm going college football that's my that's blue yeah that's my super bowl when is that game  in a few days right uh yeah i think wednesday or thursday no why is it on a wednesday or thursday  night wouldn't that be a good saturday night thing to do it's amazing how they're just throwing  football games on these weird nights of the week it used to be just monday night football it was sunday  and then you'd have monday night football and then they decide that thursday yeah throw a game on 
[00:54:00]  thursday and saturday and that is they're all on the nfl network so you got to subscribe to the nfl  network to get those games ah money all comes down to the almighty buck wow jesus  wow that was a hell of a sneeze enjoy your flu boys great  captain trips for everybody um all right moving on huh we'll all root for the ravens  i can't i i i don't think that's what art modell did in cleveland and just took them to baltimore 
[00:54:30]  i can't root for those scummy ravens wow uh was that 20 years ago well you know you gotta find  reasons to hate teams that's a good one the giants should be killed in some sort of  an easily avoidable accident with the eagles so they should both be wiped out i probably want  to see it at pittsburgh afg oh my god i'm gonna get terry bradshaw play for the steelers and i hate him  why do you hate terry bradshaw stupid jock who thinks he's funny they're always shuffling papers  and laughing back to you jb shut your mouth you don't like those guys don't be hasty you don't like 
[00:55:00]  those guys being real men yeah a bunch of guys just laughing how how how much fun can one group  of guys have the dallas steelers rivalry used to be very big it was yes yeah yeah when uh who was  who was quarterback for roger staubach staubach and then danny white and uh yeah thank you mr 1970s  well you know something that's kind of what i remember that's all i remember i can't keep i  can't be bothered in this day and age oh my god the kid that means joe green through the jersey too 
[00:55:30]  in the commercial is 55 right now wow wow i want to mention some bills when they had their nice run  and i thought that was too long ago god anthony's wearing a jack ham jersey  still talking about the immaculate reception this guy the hell's wrong with you wow i can't help it  you liked football when they were wearing leather helmets huh that's right the gif wow 
[00:56:00]  all right it happens look at the mean joe green commercial wow something shot out of my body because  now i don't feel right he's gotta be he's a little all right how old's the kid in the famous  uh mean joe green that right now has to be 77 but how old is he right now 12 follow me on this  he let me see 30 he's 39 years old well how old is he right there you think probably seven or eight  seven or eight so he's yeah he's pushing 40 37 he's pushing 40 now he's pushing 40 that little 
[00:56:30]  kid do you have the audio that would be cool audio man that was joe green he wrote a bottle at his head  yeah hey kid catch and then he goes yeah take it easy yeah and throws a sweaty nasty smelling jersey  at him and then he says hey kid the kid turns around he goes catch and throws his because mean joe  green for anybody under the age of 62 that was watching football at that point uh the demo is skewing 
[00:57:00]  older so for those of you that remember uh roger maris is 64 the uh mean joe green was a was a  really mean guy yes the name yes yes mean joe green that wouldn't have been nice if his name was  friendly ted green yeah nobody would care  wouldn't mean anything i know we're supposed to talk about anthony falling and a speeding ticket we  will after the break but um i think we could squeeze this in i just gotta say i hate robbie 
[00:57:30]  knievel yeah i hate this robbie knievel using using his dad's name to try to get the same fame and uh  he's he's terrible sort of wearing the same type of stuff his father wore he's doing motocross jumps  and getting very rich and famous off this like it's some kind of daredevil thing like his dad did  these young dudes are doing exactly this on on any given weekend you go to the x games uh and you 
[00:58:00]  see some of these guys on on uh bikes there and they're just doing amazing things and he's uh what  pisses me off is that he's still getting a tv audience for his his joke jumps you see the latest  one yeah the one guys are are flying twice as far and twice as high than this robbie knievel why is he  on tv doing this why to the roof huh didn't he just jumped onto the roof but then he kind of  kind of jumped back off it was kind of creepy he jumped from like one building to the up to the  that was if that was a maybe that might have been the last one that might have been cool but do it 
[00:58:30]  on a big heavy harley like like his dad with no suspension no computers nothing yeah that guy rode a  cinder block and uh jumped uh like lines of buses right and missed barely had shocks on his on his bike  so he had to land perfectly or he was definitely look at that jump and they have all sorts of  fireworks and flames to make it look cooler because they they know it sucks yeah they were showing all 
[00:59:00]  of his old jumps like leading up to this right because you know he's trying to like uh do all the  jumps that his father you know tried to do oh that's good that once you leave your dad alone and and  you'll never be evil the ramps where he's you know uh why does he hold on i know you're in and i'm  sorry if he's going to do his father's old jumps then use his father's old bikes like i was saying  try exactly these are like you know amazing bikes now compared to what he had and the ramps are all  different they're the ramps they're showing the grand canyon jump that he did the ramp is is halfway 
[00:59:30]  out into the canyon right like he's not jumping the grand canyon no of course not and he and he calls  himself captain robbie knievel jimmy you're gonna love this guess how he spells captain  with a k hopefully with right d-o-u-c-h  that's right uh so fox they humor him and look at this jump he's he's barely 20 feet off the ground  i know that ramp is stupid it looks so small talk to my motocross fans out there he goes down a 
[01:00:00]  ski slope drop too right he's going down this downhill that gets his speed up  evil used to just do it from flat ground right he comes flying out of the uh look at him now he's  like not like where the football team comes running out of and now he's walking around the ramp like  he just escaped death and his people have to make believe like oh my god this was a close one robbie  and they've also got to create uh like different ways that this is dangerous because on the new 
[01:00:30]  year special they were saying how since it was in las vegas on the strip uh they were only constructing  the ramps right now because they couldn't do it before because of all the tourists and you know  what happens uh so there's a chance they might not be a problem yeah someone doesn't put a screw in  the right spot yeah well please here uh really quick the play-by-play tells people how much planning  went into the jump the play-by-play guy seriously robbie is a team of professionals working around the 
[01:01:00]  clock to make sure everything goes to plan they plot out the exact mathematical equations to ensure success  from the angles of the ramps to precisely when he shifts gears it's all very heady stuff and even  the smallest misstep will spell disasters yeah that's just just how evil did it making sure  everything was safe the beauty of evil knievel he didn't know if he was going to make the jumps  that guy did not know it's like i think i could jump these buses or i think i could jump this fountain 
[01:01:30]  yeah he pretty much uh uh just did it uh not knowing it robbie knievel though it's all tested  he knows the bike is engineered it's all sorts of computers look at the clearance he's got on that  rear wheel yeah yeah evil had a cape on too which he's got to be kill you for wind resistance  evil's bike that he's using in this photo that we have up it's like a stock car like there's like no  aftermarket parts no that the bike that robbie's on is just completely engineered specifically for 
[01:02:00]  for this evil's bike weighs a ton evil might have thrown a couple little things in there to make  his odds a little better but nothing like his son look at the travel on the wheels jimmy makes a good  point he's got a cape okay that's so stupid okay he's got to do nothing to help you okay what a dummy  that's why we love evil knievel for the youngsters out there man google some evil videos today 
[01:02:30]  amazing what does fonzie jump oh the shark jump the shark well that's the famous you know he also  jumped uh a bunch of uh garbage pails or something in front of arnold that ended up going into the  chicken shack that was the cliffhanger yeah yeah oh boy what's gonna happen to fonzie is that awful  you think oh boy it is the douchiest thing you could possibly watch oh it's so  because he has like a leather jacket but the new let the non-tough guy leather and they play like  the dramatic version of the happy days music i don't remember that yeah they play like this 
[01:03:00]  dramatic music like something something could happen to fonzie remember when he was he actually  jumped the shark on water skis right and he was wearing his leather jacket as he was water skiing  right and and they asked him if everything was okay and he gave a thumbs up  oh if only the shark ate him like quint i'd love to see him getting we got the video up right now  we'll uh we'll link it of course to onaradio.com or just once if he would have quite like 
[01:03:30]  richie's driving why is richie driving he's not qualified he drove the boat too fast all his hair  fell out he drove under a lawnmower blade look at him trying to jump the shark in slow motion the  leather yeah with the leather that's the actual moment that the uh saying got made for jump the  shark that's it and water skis i i don't remember this jacky i thought the stupid sharks were in a  tank outside arnold's no they're kind of pinned i don't remember this and then yay 
[01:04:00]  hey hey oh and then he jumps jenny piccolo and gets chlamydia that was the episode i wanted  oh is that fantastically horrible that's awful he's got to do it in his leather  that was like his biggest fear right and water and sharks the sharks yeah of course he had to  overcome it robbie knievel talks about how awesome uh well they talk about how awesome robbie knievel is  he doesn't use a speedometer guys because oh well incredibly with all this planning i want to mention one 
[01:04:30]  piece of information that always astounds me robbie refuses to put a speedometer on the motorcycle  wow really he got a ticket on the ramp for speeding he's crazy boy he sure is  speedometer on the motorcycle he's been doing it for so long that he uses  his instincts and his ears simply to gauge the pitch of the bike and how fast he should be going  it's a it's a real marvel to witness and you'll see it here in a moment no it's not you know 
[01:05:00]  he can't even look a motocross guy in the eye he has to look the other way like oh they're on to  me the way the uh ramps are set up he's got a lot of leeway as far as uh his speed goes right  evil knievel had to be at like 88 miles an hour they just couldn't figure out that engineering for  evil yeah they gave him like five feet to land on robbie's got to be anywhere between 30 and 100  miles an hour to make this jump right really yeah 
[01:05:30]  but they keep putting this robbie knievel on tv i know we're late screw you stun bring the big call  robbie makes the jump this is how it went down  this is how it went down  he's made it yeah  robbie knievel is doing gaza strip  yeah there you go why don't you ride your your bike through the gaza strip there robbie  any aircraft fire on him while he's going over the ramp you call yourself captain robbie knievel  why don't you go into a war zone and ride around and see if you can make it through 
[01:06:00]  and jump the gaza with jump the gaza strip with a torah behind you like evil used to wear with  the cape see how ballsy are that's right oh that's a good one rabbi knievel  this hack stupid hack robbie knievel has made it successfully landed cleanly and now  wow  celebrates like a devil likes to yeah how's that taking his  car who's like his old man punching his wife in the face that curve he made the approach hit 
[01:06:30]  perfectly in a perfect landing and happy new year yeah happy new year yeah that commercials  dude oh it just makes me go like we can talk about that after they've been having so many  goddamn disease commercials on over the holidays i can't take the lung cancer one either you could  hear it before you actually see it the wind working its way around the tumors in your lungs  like ah who's smoking just let people die having fun all right there you go robbie knievel that was 
[01:07:00]  uh exciting really exciting it was thrilling ugh i didn't even know i i really didn't know he was  still doing that crap yeah he's got his own issues he does yeah his personal life is kind of a mess  robbie knievel yeah he'd been involved in uh you know some uh drinking i think i don't think daddy  loved uh mr mr mr robbie knievel daddy didn't show much love and then daddy got a little jealous 
[01:07:30]  of uh him doing the same thing evil was quite the insufferable prick he sure was is he dead  quite a lot yes he's dead he finally died he hung in there though man he had all sorts of problems but  hung in there like last year yeah he was he was on a little rascal at the end of his life with like an  oxygen tank or something he should have pushed his coffin over a ramp into the hole  we would appreciate that right red white and blue stars on it you put a little little rocket 
[01:08:00]  boosters on it and then just watch it crash on a wall and his body falls out everybody laughs  that's a good time it kicks it right  might as well get a chuckle if you have to go to that horrific thing  all right let's find out what happened in after the break uh he fell down  and he got a speeding ticket what right you said that said i got pulled over oh pulled over sorry 
[01:08:30]  did you get the speeding thing what happened we'll let you know after this is it a speeding thing uh  yeah yeah kind of all right keep it that kind of we'll find out next opie and anthony  opie and anthony i want to apologize to the robbie madison fans out there what that's right  robbie madison we just talked about uh uh uh captain uh what's his name i swear to god robbie 
[01:09:00]  knievel right evil there was another new year's eve jump by this guy robbie madison yeah and espn showed  it i wish i knew about this but thank god for the internet because uh stunt brain just showed me  the video this guy had a motorcycle jump on new year's eve yeah now i'm back in as far as motorcycle  jumps go the guy how do you explain this there uh stunt brain basically robbie madison jumped to the  top of the arc i can't say that french crap in front of the paris hotel basically and he went up a ramp 
[01:09:30]  yeah kind of like the robbie knievel thing right but instead of jumping over cars and stuff he jumped  up to the roof oh that's what i saw you saw that i just said he jumped onto a roof and then came that  was pretty cool yeah and he stopped watch this this amazing that is a motorcycle jump whoa very  motocrossy but much cooler than robbie knievel getting 20 feet off the ground with fireworks and 
[01:10:00]  flame this guy didn't go with the flames and stuff because he knew what he was doing was cool enough  because he's and he's still on the roof now and he's looking down they give you a perspective  on how high he is that that is the second best thing i've ever seen that arc involved in  something to do with hitler obviously from bayshore is laughing it's a hitler thing i'm not stupid  i don't know what it was though the way he comes off maybe when his armies were goose stepping  through it conquering that bastard city can i show this again no hold on leave it on leave it on 
[01:10:30]  oh you you missed it when he comes off the roof he jumps back off the roof wow did he yes that's  what i was saying this guy was i wasn't even listening to you when you said that maniac i  thought you were referencing something that happened a while ago that's insane now that's a stunt  yeah he came off the roof that's what i thought you guys meant like well i know a pretty cool one  what did he jump through like one big truck tire with a little no twizzler on it you were talking  when you said the roof thing robbie knievel did do a roof jump that was nothing like that he went from 
[01:11:00]  roof to roof i do believe that is amazing this is an amazing jump although the motocross guys would  argue that we do this every weekend but still that is pretty effing cool i just landed flat right up on  there he knew exactly where the bike would reach like apple and look no fireworks that proves you're  doing something cool when you don't have to jazz it up with the fireworks and there was two right two  of them in vegas the same night yeah wow robbie knievel was doing something they got someone else 
[01:11:30]  why didn't fox get this robbie madison this is that he just made robbie knievel look like a chump  what did robbie knievel what did he jump nothing he went from one ramp to another 20 feet off the  ground maybe i would say 20 feet off the ground tops that's a kick-ass stunt right there yeah we'll  link it but it's uh robbie madison new year's uh jump on youtube i didn't even know the two of  we see robbie knievel's again i for some reason didn't realize that they were oh it stinks yeah thanks in  comparison that wow that wasn't thank you for turning me on to that i didn't know that was 
[01:12:00]  going down new year's eve he jumped what did robbie knievel jump a bunch of mattresses with  gumballs on them it sucks right the creep watch here's the robbie knievel oh now we gotta  compare it to that compared to this yeah first of all they send them again they send him down this  giant ski slope thing to build up speed instead of just building up speed and i guess he was jumping  the bike the volcano or some volcano volcano volcano volcano he has mirage on his helmet what a 
[01:12:30]  douche selling space all over his uh uniform whatever he's uh all right so he's on this is  the robbie knievel he's on top of a roof not a roof jimmy just the top of a dumb ramp  down ramp to get his speed up going down and then he goes around a corner and this is look this is all  he did that's all he did that's all he did 20 feet off the ground jump nothing nothing supposedly  the volcano he's pumping outside the mirage in vegas some people say he didn't even really jump  the volcano show that's a room that show that fruit that other guys uh jump oh that's why that's 
[01:13:00]  embarrassing that really is embarrassing right knievel should just go away now this robbie madison  made you look stupid that is embarrassing he did jump it uh and then he came back to the ramp  and he pumped his fist like it was a real victory right look at this robbie madison no fireworks  nothing he just goes up this ramp and lands on the roof he's on a roof oh my god and then horrifying  he jumps back off the roof back onto the ramp that's that's probably crazier than the actual stunt i 
[01:13:30]  watched this and i saw him like teetering by the edge of the roof and i'm like why is he looking over  the roof he's gonna fall off and then stupid takes his motorcycle and goes off the roof stupid  i'm like jesus dude stupid right here he goes watch look at that we got some more info on robbie  madison hold on amazing uh let's say how to ed in connecticut ed hey uh you know they said that  robbie madison when he landed yeah he hit he hit so hard he broke both of his hands really that's a 
[01:14:00]  man right there boy his hands are broken he broke both hands supposedly on this stunt when he landed yep  he hits so hard if you watch at the end he hits if you watch how he hits he bounces he almost loses  it at the end wow that is amazing now that is something i i would have watched if i knew it was  on tv espn's got to promote this crap better yeah you know what the thing what he did thank you ed  yeah he did hurt uh let's say how did zach in tennessee uh zach oh he was supposed to come off and  hit the top of the ramp and kind of trail down yeah but i think he went a little too far and he missed 
[01:14:30]  most of the ramp and kind of almost hit at the bottom oh my god he really almost gave us a great  video uh let's say how to uh zach in tennessee zach hey boys how are you hey hey i heard uh i heard  robbie on uh the ellis show the other day talking about wait the the what show the jason ellis show  it's a show on sirius and uh he was i don't even understand what this is a show on sirius it's a 
[01:15:00]  jason ellis show uh jason ellis yeah jason ellis he's a motocross racer no jason ellis actually has  a good show where's he on faction or something yeah he's on uh yeah faction 52 i heard tapes of  him recently the guy's uh does a pretty cool radio show but anyway go ahead zach i do like it but um  robbie was on there talking about how robin kniebel gets all the press and all the accolades from  be just because of his father's name right no matter if he could be jumping a toothpick and he still  gets press even though the other guy he was on there he he ripped his thumb almost off of his 
[01:15:30]  hand that's what he did when he landed you could see his hand go straight down the gear on the gear  on the handlebar and rip his thumb off almost and he didn't get nothing for it man yeah he's a lot  better no one's talking about robbie madison today everyone's talking about oh robbie kniebel did  another daredevil stunt who cares about this robbie kniebel the vegas papers are reporting he tore the  flesh right down between his thumb and forefinger did he break the hand too uh no but it's just  oh he said it was the worst see this webbing this webbing was just ripped all the way down 
[01:16:00]  he's good man for interview get him on there robbie madison yeah get him on  start making calls i want to talk to this guy and give him uh real props yeah real props  i i've hated robbie kniebel forever forever and now i'm glad that this robbie madison made him look  like a chump out there in vegas not a chump a chump wow harsh language uh let's say hi to mike in 
[01:16:30]  hoboken mike what's going on first of 2009 the boys are back that's the number of times i'll do it  wow we got it hold on we got a robbie kniebel fan uh matthew from brooklyn opie stop bashing robbie  kniebel i want you to try jumping with a bike like him good one that's that's good well go look  at the robbie madison video and then get back to me exactly that's a real jump go ahead mike i have  more faith in pearl bailey's athletic that's right a pearl bailey joke and i was a huge i was a huge 
[01:17:00]  fan of evil kniebel and just like everybody else trying to jump crap with my dumb bike because evil  but this i'm not a fan i'm not a fan of his son sorry okay mike before before he actually didn't  do his little crappy jump they showed these computer animations of what could possibly go wrong during  his jump and they showed him hitting the ramp and they showed this little computer robbie kniebel 
[01:17:30]  flipping all over and the last one that they showed was a computer animation of him going off the ramp and  actually falling into the center of the volcano yeah and then they did the jump yeah and it was  if you can see those animations they're absolutely ridiculous uh anthony's a pretty smart guy what  would it take for robbie kniebel to fall into the middle of the volcano in the middle of his jump uh  first of all he wasn't going over the top of the volcano right they put the ramp to the side to make  it look like he's gone over it but he's really not right and if he fell in it uh something tells me 
[01:18:00]  it's a fake volcano well besides that it it would be impossible for him to lose his momentum in the  middle of that jump no matter what there would have to be some kind of crazy gust of wind yeah some  kind of tornado to stop his momentum i was injured once i'm doing a jump gregory no yes i'm ted the  daredevil hey ted how are you i have a cape but i wear it the front that's silly yes and the wind blows 
[01:18:30]  it in my face it looks like a burka ted did you have a new year's eve uh jump i certainly did yeah  yes i jumped a bag of marshmallows a bag of marshmallows yes there were ants all over it  it was very frightening dangerous  i landed and i crotch slammed into that little bar ow yeah it split my testicles  oh oh i just saw a trailer for the pink panther 2 oh no oh no it it it i can't even i saw it i saw 
[01:19:00]  it i heard it the trailer and um it's it's horrid yeah can we horrid we hear audio that i just saw it  had it sitting here for a while we could wait when he he's trying to say hamburger and and somebody's  trying to coach him on how it's part one hamburger oh was that it because he does it again i think  we got some new stuff it was so funny i guess they put it in the second one great yeah we have it for 
[01:19:30]  after the break okay by the way i guess i got to go with fast freddy actually opie nobody is talking  about uh robbie knievel or robbie madison today no one is yeah the days of daredevil motorcycle guys  are pretty much uh you know what in the past you saw that freaking robbie madison amazing that was  pretty good fred in uh boulder city hey that guy uh robbie madison has tourette syndrome  oh they were showing him on tv doing the interview right he's doing all this twitching and i'm like 
[01:20:00]  what the hell's wrong with this guy did he hurt himself and i was just like no he has tourette  syndrome maybe he doesn't have tourette he just hit his head a few times  but if you watch him he twitches like a fish out of water it's funny but they should have a daredevil  league and get all these guys together oh he also had the uh guy did the black back flip on with  this off-road car too uh down there tonight i was down there that night it was yeah i couldn't get  anywhere near it but it was pretty cool but i like this robbie madison i'm gonna i'm gonna look up  all his videos now does he have uh other videos that are cool like this one he did this past new

[01:26:00]  happy fella but they act like a blanket is trying to operate the whopper computer i know blanket you  morons everything i did not see this commercial every dude this is on every two seconds they look  like they're part of a cult they do everything uh uh this snuggie or every every infomercial makes  whatever they're selling uh look like the answer to your dreams because whatever uh it's replacing 
[01:26:30]  is so inconvenient i saw the one for glasses for the sunglasses this thing and the hd wraparound  hd wraparounds and and uh uh they're talking about the sun gets in your eyes and some some  people use clip-on sunglasses for their prescription glasses and they show the guy clip them on and then  he's blocking the sun out from the sides and looking like ah these don't work like everything's 
[01:27:00]  inconvenient like he just walked into a nuclear reactor and the brightness is killing him but then  he puts the other glasses on and everything's fine same thing with the snuggie you put a blanket on  you and and it flies off of you it says she's wearing using a flying carpet trying to cover  herself yeah i don't understand why you would be annoyed trying to work a blanket so now you have  a blanket with sleeves the snuggie that thing looks awful i saw this all christmas season long this 
[01:27:30]  commercial was on yeah and every time i'm just like the stupid snuggie the website is www.getsnuggie.com  get snuggie oh i want that thing covered in three  the crusty the snuggie is just awful who wants a sleeved blanket  well it's not a blanket anymore funny you should ask jimmy funny you should ask let's say hi to  chris in new york chris uh-oh chris hi hi chris hi there i uh called because i ordered a snuggie 
[01:28:00]  uh because my daughter said she wanted it and then later on i found out she was only joking  oh you dummy i know but what a trauma they put you through you know you call you think you're  going to order this thing but now you have to go through the call lasted 15 minutes yeah let me tell 
[01:28:30]  you something about everything you order on television it's a scam everything is some kind  of scam to try to sign you up for other stuff for other stuff they try to sell you other stuff they get  your number which they then sell to other uh companies it's it's amazingly ridiculous what  they do uh and then the the big thing now that they're doing with all these infomercials is but  wait we'll send you a second snuggie pay separate shipping and handling and then the shipping and 
[01:29:00]  handling is oh just about as much as the snuggie yeah that must be how they make their money and  don't forget the little book light too snug danny yes snug danny oh yeah there's a book light yeah  i just i don't remember exactly what product it was for but uh they were trying to back sell you on  what they had just shown you and they're like and we're throwing in a us and they showed a usb cable  and like this is this usb cable is a 25 value and you're getting it free it's like it's a four cent 
[01:29:30]  cable that everyone has 50 of yeah i don't know one person that doesn't have 50 usb cables later on  the house 25 value yours absolutely free wow thanks thanks for that they'll they're like throwing like  you know uh zip strips and these special plastic ties to hold it together so you get this this the  zip strips and there's a ninety dollar value for ten dollars but wait we'll double the order right  what just wait hey separate processing yes separate processing and uh shipping they call it processing 
[01:30:00]  and shipping not even handling anymore you know it's some minimum wage mexican guy that's working in this  place he's not making eight bucks a pop on uh uh boxing this thing up unbelievable so did you like the  snuggie yeah yeah i haven't even gotten it yet oh boy they didn't get it that um you know it's  going to take weeks for me to get this but they did already charge me of course they did yeah this 
[01:30:30]  thing is awful six to eight weeks delivery by the way all right six to eight weeks six to eight weeks  delivery they probably hand make them as they get ordered because there's only three people that want  a snuggie and i hope they're really flammable like i hope what gives them their great color is the  gasoline type of color dye that's what you have to use you have a cigarette because the same people  also sell like face burn bandages 
[01:31:00]  you can't get out of your snuggie because you're all sleeved in yeah you're sleeved in there yeah  you can't just throw it off like a flaming blanket you drop and roll and it just wraps around you like  burning plastic nice this thanks to your body hey here's the uh snuggie commercial oh you want  to keep warm when you're feeling chilled but all right then turn up the heat or get a stupid blanket  get a blanket no no blanket listen she'll tell you oh i'm sorry yes i'm the dummy i'm the dummy  the woman in the commercial is actually nailing the blanket to her cab so it doesn't fly off 
[01:31:30]  get a hold of yourself miss it's a blanket i'm blanket she's like it's a wolverine she's trying to put on herself  panic-stricken  you want to keep warm when you're feeling chilled but you don't want to raise your heating bill  blankets are okay but they can slip and slide and when you need to reach for something your hands are trapped inside  now there's the snuggie trapped inside talking about your private pile 
[01:32:00]  you could get trapped and beaten but with soap  who's ever had to call 9-1-1 to be taken out of a blanket because you couldn't get bonbons with  the remote control dummies what was the private has anyone ever had a perm with a blanket no i'm  trying to think if i've ever had a real problem with a blanket  one time honestly i was watching tv and i was i was going to reach for something and when i reached  my arm out the blanket kind of came off my arm oh no so i had short sleeves on and the arm was 
[01:32:30]  temporarily chilly yeah but then i got what i was supposed to get and i took the blanket with the  hand that was still covered and i flipped it over and then my other arm was covered too it was fine  again so you didn't even need uh sleeves on a blanket no but it would have been so nice because i  wouldn't have gotten that little chill that i got yeah but i was reaching for the for the lubricant  and how about the fact that your hands are sticking out and cold like part of the blanket is getting 
[01:33:00]  your hands under the air i'm sure they've been getting all warm no they haven't oh no she's reading  a book and her hands are sticking out she's wearing a backwards robe it's a robe straight jacket tie it in  a knot in the back and beat your grandma as she wears a stupid snuggie yeah but you got easy access  to grandma's backside yeah who doesn't want that yeah you can take a dump in it while you're still uh  nice and warm that's why they call it the dump blanket it comes like on the on the top thing  just get like a toilet paper roll holder and when you need to reach for something your hands are trapped 
[01:33:30]  inside now there's the snuggie the blanket that has sleeves the snuggie keeps you totally warm and  gives you the freedom to use your hands she's describing clothing remote yeah or read a book in  total warmth and comfort it's a dress your laptop without being cold or enjoy a snack while staying  snuggly warm ew if they use another version of the word snuggie snuggie uh sounds like a fetish

[01:37:30]  in the church choir when i put it on yeah  fernando brings up a good point i'm sure they'll  fernando i'm sure they'll dump out down the hall but someone out there will hear this go ahead fernando  hey what's up guys great show i just wanted to point out that if you got the snuggie and you're a guy  you're trapped on the snuggie you can't you can't masturbate  if you're if you're watching porn on the computer or through on a dvd true you're trapped under it 
[01:38:00]  and you can't there's no access to your easier now there's no access to your peter the snuggie  should have like a little doggy draw on the front it's all a conspiracy man i hear you they want us  to join cults no well you know the thing's just falling off of your shoulders it's awful stand up  all right so back we went off on a tangent oh yeah i was talking about presents and stuff and  how we had to do secret santa so i only have to get one gift for for somebody we on thanksgiving we  actually pass around the old hat pull the names out we gave up on that but we did that for you and 
[01:38:30]  then christmas you get that person a gift does the person that pull your name just try not to show the  over-the-top excitement no because they got to get me something oh it goes like secret so i pick a  name and i have to get somebody something oh i don't know it's right okay i got you i got you  so uh i got my uncle and uh decided because he likes uh wine to get a really really really  really good bottle of wine a decanter a nice decanter to a decant i got four of those if anybody 
[01:39:00]  needs one decanter yeah what does he can't do by the way it uh lets the wine breathe it's yes just  another excuse to buy just stuff open it and drink it no the guy at the wine store told me  i just has to breathe for an hour he goes pour pour some of the glass and then pour the rest in  the decanter and then and then taste the glass and then taste what's in the decanter it lets some of  the alcohol burn off a little bit i i've heard all that but i can't tell it dude it it really is it 
[01:39:30]  was and it was an amazing bottle of wine very good but uh well i was drinking a lot of wine on christmas  eve a lot of wine and um uh then uh yeah i went home and the thought once i got home thank god you  got a driver woof  i put the cruise control on one less thing i have to worry about is how fast i'm going 
[01:40:00]  and then i keep it uh in the right lane and you calculate what's fine what's the speed because you  don't want to be perfect because that that's suspicious about sixty two sixty two is the  speed sixty two thirty five zone over over lawns knocking over mailboxes driving through people's  backyards yeah got wine in the car yeah uh so um well i got home although the next day keith did tell  me he goes i your truck was a little in the middle of the driveway usually you're you know one side or the 
[01:40:30]  other but i didn't think i i was just parking for room so i uh i get home it's christmasy on the way  by the way on the way i'm thinking i might go to the carousel of course and if i had gone there  i would have drank beer and it would have just put me over the top one brain cell that was left in my  head that hadn't been affected told me no just go home you idiot that's some responsibility so i 
[01:41:00]  went home not the responsibility we're hoping for but all right and now i got pumps on my pool cover  right pumps the water off you know how wasted were you um i was doing pretty good yeah i i was doing  pretty good so uh i go i go out back with a flashlight because i had to defrost the uh the pumps before i  left uh so i go out to check when pumps working so i get the little flashlight i go out back and there 
[01:41:30]  was a strip of ice it had to be i don't know 12 inches long by by five inches wide nothing and i  slipped on that ice and went down and it was after midnight so it's officially christmas  so the neighbors got to hear um santa yelling the c word the f word the s word i was screaming curses  as i'm just laying down on my uh patio what kind of fall was like a cartoon fall no it was a your  back it was a uh my my left foot went out from under me i i went down on the side of my kneecap 
[01:42:00]  and the side of my elbow which really hurt not at the time at the time i'm just like ah i just fell  all that sucks um so then i finally you know go to bed you like the old lady from the medical alert  commercial i've fallen my son michael got me the life call alert uh so i i i went to bed and now my 
[01:42:30]  party is christmas day which i've told everybody to come over at two o'clock family friends yes  presents catered yes all in told everyone two o'clock right it's not bad i think it was about  three in the morning when i finally got to sleep plenty of time plenty of time i woke up at nine  in the morning um with one of the worst hangovers in history it was so bad that uh i was just my head 
[01:43:00]  was pounding and spinning i was oh woofing you puked oh yeah i was just puking aren't you too old  to be puking i my hangovers are bad i don't puke when i'm drunk like some people puke when they're  drinking i'll puke hours late sometimes a day later i'll puke it's horrible my hangovers are terrible  hangovers are directly proportional to how good of a time you were having the night before though because 
[01:43:30]  what fun i had that's a sign from god it's not it's alcohol god is telling you something  and uh so now um it's starting to creep up i'm laying in bed i got a wet rag on my head and i'm  writhing in pain and uh uh i i'm looking at the clock and time is flying by and i'm not getting any  better and i'm thinking it's gonna come up on two o'clock and i'm not gonna be able to even answer  the door what does the wet rag get up it just keeps my head cool and my eyes and my 
[01:44:00]  head hurt so bad that the coolness feels good so i took some aspirin and that i'm drinking water  like crazy just trying to feel better and uh thank god i get a text from keith that says uh i'll be over  in a little bit i'm like doors open so i i trod downstairs unlock the door go back upstairs puke a  little more lay down in bed and figure keith is there everything's taken care of two o'clock rolls around  i start hearing people coming to the party and uh i'm still in bed i'm laying in bed 
[01:44:30]  i don't think i got what time did i come downstairs do you remember what time i came downstairs it had  to be it had to be probably after five in the afternoon yeah yeah there's after five so they had  been there uh over three hours yeah over three hours and you made your appearance they had dinner  yeah everybody ate already they did presents everything i wasn't at my own party oh my god 
[01:45:00]  i missed my party uh i came down everybody was still you know hanging out a little dessert playing some  games doing things but there he is when you walk down the steps yeah it was like oh well that uh  look who decided to yeah look who decided i have that one hey where you've been home well glad you  could make it welcome to the all right they're all doing they're all doing they're right they're all 
[01:45:30]  doing their ryan seacrest impressions making believe they're you know i want i swear not not acknowledging  what's happening in front of their eyes i wanted to unload on them like dwight yokum in sling blade  get out of my house retard retard push the guy in the wheelchair into the door  amazing oh is he fantastic yeah so uh i was a hurting and then uh you know the weird thing about a 
[01:46:00]  bad hangover is you have one beer and you say to yourself i really wasn't feeling that bad  how could i have felt so bad you have to have the uh prescription beer medicinal beer the first sip  is horrible but then once you're done with the beer you go did i really feel that bad how many beers  that you end up having knowing you had this horrendous hangover going oh and then that night 
[01:46:30]  going on yeah you just keep going until you know you go to go back to sleep and then you wake up and  feel better because you know i wasn't drinking wine that wine will knock you on your ass  drank a lot of it that night and then uh every other night was pretty much just you know beer or wine  drinking drinking having fun uh but not really doing it i really didn't do anything i i hung out  at the house i played uh a call of duty five nice um i was uh watching a lot of a lot of tv a lot of 
[01:47:00]  bad movies things like that and then uh uh yesterday my mother and sal say why don't you come over  dawn and joseph are coming over with the kids and that's where we'll leave this oh well  you had a little problem getting back to your house last night no getting to my mother and sal  oh two whoop whoop whoop whoop all right we'll yeah two we'll continue with anthony's uh vacation 
[01:47:30]  stories home in just a few minutes opie and anthony hi welcome back to the opie and anthony program  i have to just i want to announce and apologize to kenny uh my third show double god is on sale for  uh january 18th the other two are sold out and now wednesday january 21st i'm doing the miami  miami comedy festival i'm in south beach uh at the lincoln theater and i thought it was going i was  flying out tomorrow i'm so stupid i'm like kenny i'm flying tomorrow he's like no you're not it's 
[01:48:00]  the 20th i was off by like 15 days i'm such an idiot so and i the second because i heard that little  exchange go back and forth the second i heard it i was like i know kenny's right like you're like no  it's it's today i gotta fly out today and kenny's like no and you knew kenny was right and you still  wanted to yell because he's crazy like that yeah i was panic stricken because when i said kenny i thought 
[01:48:30]  maybe i just talked about a flight because i'm like yeah i gotta fly tomorrow and the look on his face it's  the look that you'd always expect kenny to have on his face yeah like a blank i don't know what  you're talking about look that's the if you only heard him on the phone you think that's how he  looked all the time yeah and he's like no that's the 20th you know what i hate kenny now why why do  he have to tell you i asked but kenny said yeah we're flying tomorrow and you show up with all your  luggage he's not coming with me that would have been beautiful why'd you have to say anything 
[01:49:00]  i would have let this dummy freaking get all his luck if i didn't say anything i would have went to  the airport tomorrow after the show kenny you suck oh with that let that happen it would have been a  panic yeah i would have gone to the airport you'd have been arrested you'd have made a big scene i  would have i have a ticket i gotta go before believe me the the you do you know who i am would have flown  out they would have said no we don't we live in boston philadelphia and vegas  that was hurtful please all right so uh when we left you anthony was on his way to his uh mom's 
[01:49:30]  house yes and sal's house yeah you know you do the sunday uh sunday afternoon thing go over there and  uh what card did you take out kids i took the escalade nice because uh you know with the weather  the way it is and the salt on the roads and stuff i don't want to take the mustang out uh so i took the  escalade which isn't known as you know a race car right and i usually don't um i i drive over the 
[01:50:00]  speed limit with it but not not like i do with the mustang um so i'm getting on to the expressway  uh it i have a very long on-ramp by my house to get on the expressway which i like because i i'm of the  school of thought that if you're getting on a major highway use the on-ramp to get up to highway speed  whenever i see somebody at the end of an on-ramp with their blinker on and their head hanging out 
[01:50:30]  the window with their elbow looking over their shoulder like oh how did you fail right how did  you fail the entire length of the on-ramp to figure this out to fit in to traffic right it amazes me  and and when i pass that car i always look and go up it figures because it's always one of them  and you know what i'm talking about yeah so uh i i give her the gun give it the gas you know 
[01:51:00]  uh working the escalate up to highway speed and i notice the back end of a police car it's not a  nassau county cop car uh it's not a sheriff's car but it is a police car uh so i see him he's in front  of me i'm on the on-ramp i see he's on the expressway i'm on the on-ramp i'm coming on i get on i move into  the middle lane and i'm holding my speed which is over the speed limit but not crazy and i pass him 
[01:51:30]  i pass the officer this is a local town cop who i think has jurisdiction over about a mile of the  expressway oh yeah yeah yeah yeah it was a local uh uh town cop but he does have expressway jurisdiction  between like one exit oh my god so um i didn't have anything better to do dude well so he's he 
[01:52:00]  gets right on my ass and now i'm like in that position where you go ah is he is he is he gonna  do this if you're gonna just do it already you know so uh it took a little while but he hits me with the  lights i pull pull right over uh it's expressway so i pull over on the off ramp and um very close to  the side i give him plenty of room always give the guy plenty of room some people pull over in  the expressway and leave the cop hanging out in traffic just amazes me now the guy's pissed you 
[01:52:30]  know so i gave him plenty of room he um comes out and he just asked me for my paperwork doesn't tell  me what i did or anything because i was at this point like questioning i was like i didn't do anything  he didn't get me on radar he i wasn't going fast enough long enough for him to tell me and get my  speed uh and i i had slowed down when he pulled up behind me i had slowed down to highway speed which 
[01:53:00]  is why he got right on my my ass like that again so it was a mystery to me i'm like you know usually  when this happens i i'm sure i know why i'm being pulled over i'm doing 95 on radar so uh he comes back  and he goes what are you doing i go i was getting on the uh the on-ramp and i go you know you got one  of those choices to make either speed up to get past the car or you slow down to get behind him  so i sped up uh and i ended up in front of you and then i slowed down a highway speed he goes you passed 
[01:53:30]  me doing about 70 70 something and i was like i knew i didn't i was in the 60s somewhere but i didn't  argue the point and he said when you're behind me i go look i'll tell you i'll be honest with you  i said a lot of people when there's a cop behind them have no clue what to do do you slow down to  the speed limit do you speed up a little over the speed limit do you get out of the way he goes well  i'll tell you one thing you don't do you don't zip into another lane and pass me oh snap yeah yeah that 
[01:54:00]  was kind of like what i did um so uh he was giving you the business he was and then he goes  he goes i pulled you over before doing the same thing of course he did and i i go i like jesse  james on the expressway i can't drive on this road i'm gonna have to start taking the parkway and take  my chances with the stadies so um he remembered you he remembered me he goes he goes you were in a red  ferrari oh my god i go in a different and then he goes he goes you're gonna tell me it was the same 
[01:54:30]  thing with the on-rep i go i said no that was crazy i like agreed with him i said no that was crazy it  was a little ferrari and everything so uh he hands me my stuff back and he goes i'm not gonna write you  up because i just know your little cronies are gonna get you out of it anyway  cronies and he called him cronies threw my stuff in my lap and uh walked away 
[01:55:00]  i know your little cronies are gonna get you out of it well it's like you you always say man like  they don't dare give you a ticket they know better oh no no i never said that you were saying that in  the office no i and i was particular officer you were calling a choke no i said thank you sir thank  that's not what we heard right jimmy i said have a happy new year officer thanks nope i i smiled i  was very courteous because i'm always courteous to the police i know i'm doing wrong when i do wrong 
[01:55:30]  this one was a little much let me let me go to jimmy we heard it differently we heard it differently  marginal call this one what did he actually said he was like he said the cop was cool he's like he  called me over with curtis and curtis and uh you know he knew better so he walked away and you're  right right i didn't say anyone knew better you're right i would never say that i count my blessings  anytime something about i dare you to give me a ticket yeah we heard it no i never say that you  should anthony says one time this is what he said he didn't say it very specific but if he said if they 
[01:56:00]  actually tried to write a ticket i would line my knuckles with pba cards and punch their face and  say pick them no i never said that either i was surprised i didn't even use a pba card you did  you didn't need to you know better you got cronies i got cronies my cronies is it true you called  him a rookie what a rookie no i didn't call him a rookie i didn't i i if he's listening i want to say  again thank you for the courtesy uh that he he gave me why are you winking as you say this to let me 
[01:56:30]  i'm not winking i'm not anthony doesn't even like you like a lot of times you say i don't even make  eye contact with him like when he has my pba card he cracks his window like you know how you flick a  cigarette out the window that's how he holds the pba card and they come and get it doesn't even turn  down his radio i i tell him no you want to play 52 card pickup and then i go yeah with pba cards yes  with pba cards that's right no no i don't do that and this one i i gotta tell you every other time i've 
[01:57:00]  been pulled over i've agreed that i was completely in the wrong this time it was a very marginal call  that i don't really think i should have gotten pulled over for you do realize you shouldn't be  saying this time what i get pulled over about once a month this is the first of 2009 that was the first  of 2009 it was like wow that was fast four days in can i go local can i go local lake success yeah uh 
[01:57:30]  no no no it wasn't the lake success guys those guys are badasses you know they drive chargers and  they wow you got it and they don't like it you drive through lake success i so i can't drive through  lake success i can't drive through um uh westbury wait why not why can't you drive through like she  says uh because uh i drive too fast like i can't drive the way i want to drive oh i have to i have to  i have to put on my cruise control because i will go nuts if i if i'm behind somebody that's 
[01:58:00]  doing 60 and i see the middle lane is completely clear i will go right into the middle lane and and  goose it and get past everybody and that's when i get in trouble when i'm passing people which is  most of the time so i have to set my cruise control and just sit back and grip my teeth and go just  you're not in a hurry it's just take it easy don't go crazy and i have to do that through now  lake success westbury um the sixth precinct in suffolk county which now is is all sheriffs out there 
[01:58:30]  so i i think i'm kind of in the know this because i've been pulled over by every single one of them  the guys all know me now they got yes yeah so basically on the break and one on the guess hey  basically you're telling everybody out there that you have to be a regular joe  through three towns on long island pretty much got not a regular joe i get passed by a lot of people  and and it annoys me you know uh one foot on the brake one on the gas 
[01:59:00]  i can't drive 55 you tell him sammy oh he can't drive 55 jim  oh my god there's too much traffic i can't pass  it drives me crazy this is the song that's going through my head when i'm driving what's this 83 or  something yeah somewhere around there some awful year good black and white that's the screw of again 
[01:59:30]  and and then i sing  what you don't like this jimmy oh take my license all that jive  i can't drive  can't drive 55 cool yeah  what else rhymes i drink five alive  i enjoy burl ives this is terrible 
[02:00:00]  steven s from bayshore and tells himself you'll still be filthy rich even if it takes you an  extra 10 minutes to get there oh is that what i do tells himself maybe yeah that's that's what i  have to do when i uh drive yeah like this morning um i hit a wall of traffic oh boy and i i started  getting a little antsy up on the curb what'd you do no no no this is expressway driving it's four  you know whatever five in the morning whatever it is sure and uh i get antsy like like why are you 
[02:00:30]  in the left lane and not doing 70 at this hour you're doing 60 and you're not passing the people next  to you so it gets me kind of crazy and i start looking for openings i start looking ahead for  openings and when i find one i take it and i just i hammer down and get past the entire thing and then  i look at my rear view mirror and just see this big block of headlights and go what are they doing 
[02:01:00]  why aren't they in a hurry to get anywhere one guy had his hazard lights on in the left lane  if you got a problem that you got to turn your hazards on you better be on the shoulder or the  right lane sure this guy was in the left lane with his hazards on i had to pull next to him in the  middle lane and and just look at him until he finally looked at me and i saw something from  some far away land that didn't understand the concept to turn off your hazards it negates your  blinkers first of all it makes your blinkers useless and people you're in the left lane that's not the 
[02:01:30]  what country are you in oh it's annoying no wonder i get pulled over all the time people annoy me on the  road i get genuinely annoyed  so in driving home i set the cruise control very good because that's what i do i i don't i've been  pulled over for speeding every time i'm pulled over every time i get pulled over it's for speeding it's 
[02:02:00]  not for an illegal lane change it's not for not using my blinkers it's not for equipment violations  it's always for speeding so if i want to put the odds down of me getting pulled over i set the old  cruise stay in the right or middle lane keep her between the lines drive like a good boy you're  thinking but i've always done that it's when i'm driving to where i'm going that's the problem 
[02:02:30]  well that's what i'm not thinking basically i get what you're saying yeah exactly there's something  going on wow at your destination could be we're gonna mop up next opie and anthony  yeah it's good to be back live the opie and anthony show looking at al pacino pictures we love  teasing al's wigs and his little lips and shoes we found a new one that we can make fun of  nice wig picture what color is that it's like a light it's reddish reddish like brown mousy brown 
[02:03:00]  and all going in there but then my sides all gray you can tell where the hair ends  and the wig begins but it's too high yeah it's very high gives me extra height  with my lips i was watching uh i guess that movie that horrible movie with him and de niro is coming  out on dvd so they've been having a lot of trailers for it on tv and it's just horrible 
[02:03:30]  maybe if you sprung for a drink every now and then  movie did great we did great we made eleven dollars at the box office  i watched goddamn get goodfellas was on so of course i i put it on you just watch how great that  was the cast is fantastic sam jackson's ass before he gets shot in those little underpants with his  little underoos on it looked like he was wearing late to your own funeral but uh de niro in that 
[02:04:00]  was just it was it was it was great come here you come here you  it's fantastic do we have the pink pants sorry yeah we do the pink pants though unfortunately we  gotta get out of this joint and go to the other joint damn it i saw uh wall e finally that's on my on  demand i was gonna watch that i shouldn't trash the movie because i think eric's uh chick uh gave  us the dvd for christmas that movie jesus that movie sucked i love animated films yeah big fan of 
[02:04:30]  the pixar and stuff was this a pixar officially i think it was i think it was oh man that thing  sucked did it i didn't like it you like the wall e why would you watch that any of you about a wall  no it's not about a little robot exactly a robot cartoon and an hour and 40 minutes of your life  you're lost and this whole whole job is to clean up a city after the apocalypse or something here's 
[02:05:00]  something though when you make an animation you you should use colors it was all just browns and  it's not very colorful no not post-apocalyptic i understand that he was great i think travis liked  it too yeah good for her that movie stinks why did you like wall e well first of all wally is adorable  i called wall he's not adorable yeah he is no he's not he finds a little plant he finds a plant which  is and he shows that uh that that that what that humans can come back to their city it's the rise of 
[02:05:30]  the machines yeah yeah are they just all machines in this no humans no no there's well when they go to  the spaceship because that's where they're living at a space station it's a huge city space station  that part was funny because the humans are just losers that can't walk anymore and they're on what  hovercrafts yeah things are real and all they do is consume and they all look like e-rock  hey split screen me man i'm on to something e-rock and the humans from wall e like the captain of the 
[02:06:00]  ship yeah like the captain on the ship wall rust sorry this movie sucked it was slow it's a social  commentary i get the social commentary i get it it was good who would watch why would you watch that  it's about pixar's i hate them i like the pixar films there's a love story it out it was magical  yeah it's not magical party there was nothing magical about it this is like one of their first

[02:25:00]  know yeah he uh well you know i was trying to make a small head joke and i knew it just wasn't there  and ready for broadcast so i stopped myself by the way if you are back to the future fans do you know  that back to the future is coming out um they're putting out the um new digitally uh enhanced uh  version uh digitally remastered no but it also includes the whole video of the ride 
[02:25:30]  where from universal studios when you would go on the ride and get into the little uh delorean and it  would look like you're flying and chasing biff and that and that's included and i'm thinking that'll  look real cool in the theater is sitting in the front seat no it's not done it's getting uh this  week we're back in business the holidays you know they don't take off yeah but uh that'll be fun to  sit in the front and watch that a few hundred times maybe you know 
[02:26:00]  a lot of pot these days no what was that then because it's a special occasion if you sit and watch  the the back to the future ride in a big theater like that yeah and you feel like you're moving  yeah even though you know the theater ain't gonna move and part of the ride was the fact that the car  moved uh but still you'll get that feeling that visual feeling of movement because the whole theater's  dark so you'll just see um you know just that how much pot are you smoking i barely even touch the 
[02:26:30]  stuff yeah yeah i'm a i'm a drinky guy i don't i like the weed i'm this close to smoking pot i uh this  close had an opportunity last night did you this close it would be so rare an occasion it's been  years i turn i turn it down a lot a lot i turn it down but i drink you know like my beer like like that 
[02:27:00]  wine beer and the wine yeah hey yeah speaking of movies uh real fast uh i'm not really sure if i  like the movie but um it's a curious case of benjamin button oh that's the one where f scott fitzgerald  novel tom crew tom cruise and how it uh but gets younger right he gets younger the only thing i want  to say about the movie is like obviously brad pitt starts the movie as a really old dude right and  he's getting younger and younger and i was thinking to myself i know it's coming i know it's coming i 
[02:27:30]  know it's coming sure enough about two-thirds through the movie you came yeah i had comesies  uh they have the young the the actually younger than he is now so there had to be some kind of  fucking film magic they must have found they must have found some old stock footage of brad pitt that  they were able to work into this movie that really somebody maybe could do some research on that because  that was fucked up but besides that they've actually been making this movie for 15 years yeah 
[02:28:00]  um because they went way younger than he is now and it was like what the fuck and it didn't look like  just makeup i think they really found some old footage and did some kind of digital you know voodoo to  it but uh the theater was pretty crowded and when the young or the current brad pitt hits the screen  you you hear the women moaning throughout the whole gushing in theater gushing and gushing you heard a  a collective moan from the fucking women in this uh movie theater oh my girl didn't moan because you 
[02:28:30]  know why just she's not into brad pitt obviously  uh damn but i'm like here i knew it was gonna happen to the women they love this brad pitt they  love the fucking guy i wanted to see uh valkyrie um and and i even looked for the theater the time 
[02:29:00]  everything and then i just started thinking about it about the the theater experience going in the  fucking people that and i just i couldn't do it yeah i said fuck it i'll wait i'll wait for the  old bootleg you know it's a pretty good theater i'm gonna go local that one in huntington uh they  jazzed that fucking place up yeah it's a little nicer to see a movie in there now what's it called  hunting shore or something like that was it got stadium seating uh no the fucking movie theater  seats enough with the regular theater seats fuck how long have they had stadium seating now are you 
[02:29:30]  where you go into a theater and go ah yeah this is nice gut your shit theaters keep the riffraff out  and fucking put put it so it's it's stadium theater seating they wouldn't even take that no one's in  your fucking way every time i sit down some big mook has to sit right in front of me you got half the  screen is covered with somebody's head or you're too close your legs fucking are underneath the  guy's chair you can't cross your legs without hitting the back of the guy in front of you or 
[02:30:00]  someone behind you is doing the same thing movie theaters have been the exact same thing for years  and they suck going to them you they suck ass you preach the truth my brother yes hear what happened  in philly yeah i'm sure it was a shooting yeah whatever it was i i know the movie i saw  this guy is my idol oh do you love him yup yes let me read the story yes philadelphia man shot  because family talked during movie right good good reason wait philadelphia man shot because family 
[02:30:30]  oh he had to take the bullet for his family yapping that's what you get what are you what are you  gonna do shut your fucking family up exactly you're the head of the pride that's right let me see where  i'm at with this a south philadelphia man south philly oh boy uh man arranged uh enraged because  the father and son were talking during a christmas showing of the curious case of benjamin mutton took  care of the situation when he pulled the 380 caliber gun and shot the father all right is that some good 
[02:31:00]  weapon tree that's small fits does all right it fits you could you could do better oh boy james joseph  uh sialella jr oh thank god i'm james joseph oh i thought it was you for a second 100 me  boy if you uh live on a street that says block yeah like 1900 block of if you live on the 1900 block  yeah that's bad yeah when they have a good block after the number yeah not good his charge with 
[02:31:30]  attempted murder is that attempted murder or is that more of a shut the fuck up yeah i don't think  they have attempted shut the fuck up so you got to go with attempted murder i don't know we should  get it on the books yeah it's more of a shut the fuck up i don't think the guy was attempting to  kill him quiet this guy by the way is exactly why i'll never own a gun he is why you would do that  happily i would do it uh can i take you through this case a little bit what was the guy thinking  that after shoots the gun he's gonna enjoy the rest he's gonna watch the rest of the movie he was 
[02:32:00]  just so enraged he just had so much rage in him yeah that uh i guess he felt he had to shoot him  in the face how was the movie dad got shot yeah police were called to the theater 9 30 don't ruin  the end i don't want to know what happens the dog dies in the end oh not that stupid movie oh  uh i feel number one at the box office again of course people love the dog oh yeah i heard  that joke last week with your favorite uh actor old percy lips not only does the dog die in marlin 
[02:32:30]  my girl saw this movie they the the whole dying of the dog takes a half hour to 45 minutes it's  basically half the fucking what's it got it's the slow death thing you know we all had the dog that  you think it's gonna make it doesn't just get hit by a car does it get old does it go through the  whole life of the fucking dog it's old yes it goes from puppy to fucking old age and people want to  watch this yes because you want to remember when your dog died yeah that's a nice memory fresca

[02:33:30]  to confront the family when the father got up to protect them that's when the victim was shot once in  the left arm sending others in the theater running to safety so this guy must have took right off and  fucking got out of there after he shot somebody and then this idiot after he shot the guy remember  i remember a little while ago i said what do you do after you shoot the gun yeah and you said that  that has to end the movie for you and and you he was so annoyed this guy sat down and watched the movie 
[02:34:00]  the guy shoots somebody and then sat down and watched the movie well now you got no one in front  of you because everyone's fleeing the theater you got it's a good view police arrived a short time  later and arrested uh this guy and uh confiscated his weapon that's brilliant sit down finish the  movie come on kid don't mess around yeah drop the popcorn and my brother coming out with his juju beads  in his hands don't look directly at the screen but don't look away neither  you're gonna do fine kid why don't you tell that girl you love the movie 
[02:34:30]  amazing uh wow that is silly that's uh not responsible gun ownership no what would you do  in that case in that case i would just uh tell the guy let's say you got the guy i don't know when  you carry your gun but i'm just saying you got the gun and this is going on what what are you going  to do the thought of using the gun never comes into your mind good good you just you're in the movie  theater there's someone being an asshole you do you at least have your side a little bit like 
[02:35:00]  i'd be quiet if i was you hey i'd clam up and then and then you stick it through your jacket like an  old-time crook through your pocket i'd be quiet if i were you mugsy no you don't even the gun doesn't  even come into play there that's silly you just tell the guy shut up and then if he gets up and starts  shenanigans uh then you um report him to management yeah and say hey this guy is talking he's just 
[02:35:30]  you'd be a real about it all right you know what we do we sit there and take it that's our problem  as being white americans dude i've taken it so many times in movie theaters i'm sick of it and i know  somebody will call them oh you got pussies i don't get i get right in their face well good for you the  majority of us just sit there like little little girls and take it get in the face of about eight  to ten savages that for some reason have decided to stake a claim at every seat around you and do

[02:36:30]  fan um that brad pitt magic thing let's go to matt in virginia he knows uh i knew they were doing  something what do you got on this matt what's up hey uh i do all the it work for the company that  actually did all the age regression shots oh no shit yeah they're they're not like stock photos  okay they actually take the character and they digitally make him younger yeah i did that in x-men uh  one of the x-men movies all right i was gonna say that same company matt i gotta tell you i was

[02:39:00]  and stuff and reading up on this movie but it's like it's like a third of the movie what are they  taking to the vet yeah that whole thing is it is it did they give the old blue fluid and they'll  they're cradling the dog and it's like you're okay now you're going to be like why would you  want to see that i'll tell you the exact pressing fucking loving people love being depressed  go fuck yourselves can we can we talk dead dogs for a while what oh jimmy i i apologize go ahead 
[02:39:30]  no no say the reason that they the dog died this is what you're leaving out is because owen wilson  fucked it to death marley was sleeping and jennifer anderson had put some peanut butter on her  snatch and the dog got nauseous because he was also forced to watch friends while he ate her pussy  and then uh what's his name uh then then then owen wilson did heroin and fucked the dog and collapsed  on it and crushed its insides i didn't see that coming that's how the dog died i forgot you're not 
[02:40:00]  owen wilson fan i forgot oh yeah jimmy not a fan his heroin body collapsed go see bottle rocket and  then come back and tell me if uh if he was good in that who owen wilson oh that's that that made him  famous but does he do the i don't he wasn't doing that in bottle rocket and he didn't have the weird  fucked up nose in bottle rocket no dumb hairdo he didn't have any of that jimmy he was more of a  normal dude uh dead dogs yeah i told you when my dad my dad did the right thing like the dog 
[02:40:30]  would die dad's up early he takes the dog dumps in the woods somewhere and then tells us a nice  fairy tale story when we get up yeah like you know ah you know the dog was getting old so i brought it  to a farm and then we would question where the farm is and can we visit no no it's it's this is just  how it has a farm yeah what that i was a fucking jesus he's trying to be truthful dog bought the farm  yeah he's trying to let you in on it easy yeah you just misunderstood 
[02:41:00]  that's what dad did with uh smoky my my cat remember smoky he knew smoky was dead and we  were outside every day smoky smoky and smoky was being eaten by maggots and i finally found smoky and  one side of him was completely flat on the road oh and then the other side was like half a smoke it was  like half a smoky well no that side was bloated from all the yeah it was bloated and the other side was  completely flat and i flipped him over to stick and maggots were inside smoky and that's my last  image of smoky did you pet him boy no i didn't give him a little pat on his little half ahead 
[02:41:30]  i had a cat named midnight and oh and she had a a son named tomboy that was what i named him i was  stupid yes i i originally named her i originally named her william because i thought it was a guy  god william that's what i named her and uh the tomboy a hip on her car oh my father came and said i  have bad news and i said what and he opened a bag with tomboy and he mushed my face into it he said 
[02:42:00]  say goodbye to the faggot that's the way it should be right here i'm smacking you exactly he made me  eat the cat carcass no romantic ending for you my friend huh yeah he hit me in the face with a bag full  of my dead pet um cunning from pal talk will opie be filming chester and me well ah chester and me  yeah that one took a while too  kick in the liver will do it and then we got uh what do we got here that's might as well start reading 
[02:42:30]  it and some feedback reading from whack bag of course the movie was originally called marley  some peanut butter and me uh was this soul plane oh sorry oh oh they've shown obama in air force one  oh it was uh soul plane two oh you got a little confused there i see yeah it happens yeah all right  got that out of the way in the new year first one first one first one of the new well on the air 
[02:43:00]  anyway i've been going like a banshee at home we got bra on the line bra oh hey what's up man hey  guys how's it going hey what's up bro hey listen uh i took my son to go see that halfway through the  movie they start taking the dog to their vet like every other day the dog runs out they can't find the  dog next thing i know i gotta answer my son's asking me daddy why is he giving him the pink needle so now i 
[02:43:30]  gotta sit here with this whole i gotta tell the story to him about how the dogs die and everything  and i can't believe it it wasn't a take it's not take your kid there you know you know it's healthy  though to get into a situation where you can now explain to your children you want to go to the  movie for entertainment you're paying money right yeah my dad was a big fan of that he wants to just  be entertained in movies he didn't want these these thought-provoking movies i don't need it none of  that crap he liked old school movies hey uh uh ben's raw ass so how long does the dog die in this 
[02:44:00]  movie the dog was like they had the dog gets the bloat his stomach like turns or whatever so they got  to take him to the vet and then and i think it was probably it was probably like the last 45 minutes  maybe half hour wait wait wait that's like a third of the movie so they take him in to get the stomach  turned over yeah and what it didn't work what's a turn how do you turn over his stomach the doctor  goes oh there's only like a one percent chance of survival and he goes yeah but you don't understand 
[02:44:30]  this dog is a special dog yeah they're all special he's not like all the other dogs no his stomach is  wrong a little flip over belly the bloat the old what's that maybe that's what e-rock has  i hate when the pink needle of garlic garlic butter sauce a pink needle is the dog  in his mouth damn the uh i saw a really sad movie with a horse in it and uh it really made me cry 
[02:45:00]  yeah did it jimmy yeah because the star of the movie died yes yes why do you have to kill the horse  uh bra thanks uh uh what was gonna uh yeah okay and finally rick in st louis rick  hey rick rick i was watching some i love lucy over the break yeah they had a uh  i love lucy marathon why were they trying to pull off that fred mertz was a young dude 
[02:45:30]  were they i think so because they were like like like a couple hanging out with another couple yeah well  lucy and ricky were a lot younger than fred nethel yeah uh and uh yeah they seem to be of the same  mindset but they try to make it look like they were all just kind of equals age and how they thought  and they were just best friends yeah yeah yeah a little thought i don't know the uh i god i would  when i was watching was like this was so unacceptable uh lucy apparently thought ricky was cheating on 
[02:46:00]  her because uh ricky left a note with a bunch of girls names on it uh but the girls names turned  out to be dogs that were doing a little dog show at the club okay but so then uh lucy was reading this  uh um mystery book of the murder book so she got in her head that ricky was going to kill her  to uh then go with these other girls so fred comes up with a great idea to give lucy 
[02:46:30]  a sedative oh so he pulls out this drug box that he had in his pocket and pulls out like this  powdered fucking sleeping shit and pours it in lucy's drink and gives it to her it's like a friend  ricky's like yeah that's a good idea he goes she'll fall asleep i'll come in and check on her to make  sure she's okay of course they're drugging the wife of course yeah of course he's gonna check on  her you want to give her like a war helmet we'll give her the old roman war helmet rick 
[02:47:00]  let me tell you and he legendarily would always put on oven mitts and then grab vivian vance's  content between tanks she hated that stupid viv with her bunt yeah i hate that vivian vance and  william frawley as the drunk apparently he came in drunk all the time oh his pants pulled up you see  his fucking necktie would be tucked into his pants and his pants were up to his nipples pretty close 
[02:47:30]  my friend pretty close you fatty sorry lucille ball as the humiliated wife desi arnaz as the uncut  cheating cuban husband vivian vance is the cunt and william frawley is the alcoholic wife beater  fred uh fred uh fred uh what's his last name again fred mertz yeah he died on hollywood  boulevard william frawley dropped dead right there on hollywood boulevard leaving a movie premiere  right on the sidewalk they showed me the spot and then i i think uh uh ricky uh ricky ricardo there 
[02:48:00]  desi arnaz he uh he did an snl where when he would at that point he was riddled with fucking lung cancer  from his philip morris cigarettes that they would smoke on the show all the time we find that yeah  find some uh desi arnaz he was like yeah years years ago right before he died and then lucy would  always be on the tonight show well johnny when i was doing uh i love lucy it was uh you know ricky 
[02:48:30]  was the innovator of the three camera shoot didn't they what happened to that little voice she had  didn't they rip that off from somebody else no apparently desi arnaz was like one of the innovators  of the three cameras shoot yeah how hard is that to figure out i know he'd probably be an  innovator you idiot he used that to film himself fucking those dancers in between takes he was a  legendarily naughty boy oh he certainly loved to fuck we shot lucky louis we ate in our lunch area 
[02:49:00]  was where they used to shoot uh lucy in in the same sound stage really i love lucy that's awesome  and one of the guys come stains desi arnaz dude one of the guys was pointing where lucy used to have  people watch desi like he's like up there she would have a guy watching desi because he was  fucking so many dancers that he's like he was showing us where the desi would take these girls  and fuck them yeah he was a smooth motherfucker yeah he was desi arnaz he played bobble like  that's how he played the fucking bongos two clits at the same time neither one of them with the red 
[02:49:30]  hair on it oopsie yeah and there's the chocolate episode that happened one time when she was just  eating valium because she didn't want to face the fact that her husband was peeling back his foreskin  and fucking everything but her  well it leads us uh back to the top movies for the weekend there  right yeah you got number one marley and me where where else uh what else what else 
[02:50:00]  you got the list no i don't no i know what do you got uh let me see number two has to be valkyrie  no no way no no number one's marley and me i'm going to say number two is yes man jim carrey  or um the uh the the uh pixar release of caligula  where he puts a fist in wally's hiney his name is called wall owl 
[02:50:30]  marley and me number one number two uh caddyshack  really what year is this a little different people decided to watch caddyshack this weekend  is that it yeah somehow i don't believe you that's why these lists stay i didn't even watch caddyshack  why why would they do these lists they give you five who cares they give you five movies every week  okay you know but now i'm curious yeah well curious huh curious life of mr. fucking cocksucker 
[02:51:00]  the curious case of benjamin bolt or whatever it is don't make movie titles people can't remember  a say yeah what are you going to say curious case the brad pitt movie yeah  i'm saying you know i saw the movie it shouldn't be called the curious case it should be the holy  shit case oh yeah yeah it's not curious that this is all quite curious that he's uh no it's not it's  like quite curious you gave birth to a monster that's getting younger there's a there's more than a bit of 
[02:51:30]  uh curiosity what happens with the giving birth part like is it a baby is it a big old baby or is  this giant man come out of a cunt so so it's a baby but it looks old it looks like really a kid  pretty much yeah and then it grows into what an old man no it grows no it grows like it like you would  grow but you you're getting younger so like wait wait wait no no no i'm not understanding there was a  like what would be a six-year-old brad pitt so they were using a midget or some kind of like trickery 
[02:52:00]  so it's brad pitt's old face on a on like what would be a six-year-old's body so he was a freak  yes so it's more than a curious case wait wait wait so he gets older first what but he grow he grows  up first no no no stop you're confusing the piss out of me he's born old but he has to be younger at  first but then he gets a little bit taller and begins to go backwards but he's very young anthony 
[02:52:30]  makes a very good point i want to explore thank you he is an old dude that's growing technically  old right but he's growing younger how long does it take him to grow big to adult height  wait is he getting younger as he's getting taller yeah so he starts out as an old baby yeah  and he's like two years old and he's got an old man's face at one point he becomes brad pitt as we 
[02:53:00]  know him and then starts to deteriorate from there getting younger so now his height is starting to get  less you make a really good point about this movie i'm still not understanding though that he got brad  pitt because i saw one clip of him and he looked just like a regular old old man right height right  everything right if he was getting younger as he's growing up by the time he reached like the  height you're supposed to be as an adult he would be younger already right but that's not how it goes 
[02:53:30]  jesus christ you make a really good point this movie sucks and i haven't seen it he starts as an old dude  as an infant a little old to like how you know brad pitt and how long did that take about like i  don't know like just think backwards so wait wait but but that took a lifetime just think backwards  i'm trying to think backwards but from the time he's a baby to the time he's tall a tall old guy  i guess he's old little baby he's tall old guy when he starts going backwards when you reach your 
[02:54:00]  height 18 19 yeah all right so 18 or 19 he's at the height you would probably be i don't know as an  old man he's at that height for a while all right and then he starts to get younger get back well no  he's getting younger the whole time but then then then eventually he starts to have to get shorter  because now his life's gotta kind of just like i said think backwards he couldn't start off he  couldn't start off as a tall old man because he never would have fell out of the pussy 
[02:54:30]  right that's what i was saying elephant gave birth he had to start off as a baby old man yeah then  he gets taller because that's probably what they couldn't explain in a movie yeah how you pump out  an old man or the hat on but is he getting younger as he's getting taller yes but like you know from  70 to 68 but then how come i saw him as an old old guy at regular height he was like at 90 years  old as a baby and then he was what 70 as the regular height guy i guess okay and then getting 
[02:55:00]  younger from there and then what happens he gets into a baby and dies well you know he turns into  a fetus don't spoil the movie yeah i don't like spoiling i ain't gonna see this piece of  shit i don't like spoiling every movie he dies as a very small kid uh you gotta figure that's  gonna happen i mean what's gonna happen exactly i'm fucking with his lover holding him really  like a lover breastfeeding that sounds nice oh uncle paul hey good excuse you just tell him hey  this is that this is a curious case this girl is actually uh very old when she's in a 12 year old 
[02:55:30]  body this is ashley buttons she's a big girl she's 68 years old there is kind of an uncle paul moment in  this film because now brad pitt you get confused he's now like a normal uh normal thinking eight  year old kid but he's an old man and he's hanging out with a real eight year old girl under like a  little like like uh like cheat fort with a little candle on there just kind of being little don't ruin 
[02:56:00]  this and then he gets caught being under there by like one of the elders being a little naughty and  of course the elders basically saying how disgusting he is and stuff because she doesn't understand that  he's actually a kid and not an old man hanging out with the eight year old girl but he was his mind  is the mind of a guy with an experience of an entire lifetime no he's eight no he's getting younger  even but his mind he forgets things when no he forgot everything he fucking you're confusing me now 
[02:56:30]  and i saw his fucking movie yeah no no he benjamin buttons was started off young but then he decides to  get old and then he drops a few years no you're fucking with me and he comes back i don't understand  when he's eight years old right with the eight year old girl right he's already been old right and  he's gotten young and he's now he's down eight no he's down eight years so he's probably about 82  let's say he's 82 but how come he doesn't have this world of knowledge from all those years 
[02:57:00]  got to see the movie did you watch this fucking thing i just was amazed by the cinematography  jesus christ god you make me look stupid and feel stupid i just don't know what like oh i just  you think you would know everything because everybody would like to be in a young body but  he definitely had knowledge beyond his years uh-huh but but they also made like he's a kid 
[02:57:30]  it was right anybody out there see this no no no what happened was he wasn't chasing himself off  his own lawn why you no one questioned that this monster was living among them and by the way someone  taking my uh my joke and certainly making it a lot better uh tim and columbus where are you so the name  of the movie should have been the up case of benjamin yes because this was more than a curiosity  this was like why is this monster still breathing yeah yes i just don't even get this movie all right 
[02:58:00]  you want to explain the storyline yeah all right how does he die hey i don't know if he dies from  yeah who knows that's when you maybe let's go for to herb in cleveland who might be able to explain  this storyline herb i like to call him herb hey herb how you doing ladies uh good yes help me  the storyline of this movie is basically you enter into life shitting in a diaper and you  leave life shitting in a diaper no matter which way we get that all right that's like that's like the 
[02:58:30]  yeah the abc but right and brings up good questions like when he was a young boy that looked like an old  man was he wiser than his years but when he got younger and he was a young kid but he had been on  earth for that many years wouldn't he have knowledge  oh jesus christ you don't know shit either all right let's go he's sitting there quiet talking  fucking not saying a word let's go to lamont in queens lamont has seen the movie three times lamont 
[02:59:00]  what's up guys better reaction talking to a certain celebrity's son  wow look i didn't say a word that'd be number two all right lamont number two what happened dummy  what happened in the movie dummy that's my impression lamont all right lamont go  he's a kid he has the mentality of a child even though he looks like an old man right and as he gets 
[02:59:30]  older but starts to look younger as he gets younger that starts to deteriorate  so the whole alzheimer's thing dimension thing starts to happen when he's a kid and that's  probably towards the end of the picture oh so he's like eight years old and he's  fucking going a little senile yeah yeah he's like a goofy bastard right a goofy bastard but people are  but you can look at it as like he's not really going senile he actually doesn't have uh as much 
[03:00:00]  knowledge anymore because he's like a kid right he's got to think backwards he comes down with  dementia which i thought was alzheimer's anyway dementia okay now it kind of makes sense because  like the guy said at first you die you're starting your diaper shit and you're ending diaper  shit and it makes sense when you think it doesn't matter which direction you go in the middle is the  middle but the each end is kind of the same and can be mistaken for the other like the dementia could  just be mistaken as being a goofy kid look at do yourself a favor and being an old what here's 
[03:00:30]  the movie all right thank you all right i'm gonna screen that at the house where i can concentrate  all right lamont so great film welcome back guys did you like it i wasn't sure if i liked it  oh i i i'm not sure you watched it yeah exactly i've liked i've liked brad pitt pretty much since  seven so i mean i like the show you know what i liked it brad pitt makes a good movie that makes  a bunch of shit movies that makes a good movie right fight club seven what are some of those other 
[03:01:00]  movies he's good in he did california i didn't see that one which i thought was awful mr mrs smith  i didn't see that either but i think i think in the case of guy ritchie  come on you really shouldn't admit that you you've liked brad pitt since yeah  no no i liked him since the movie seven you did for his acting or for his abs  um a little bit of both i'm sorry to say all right peace out thanks a lot you big dummy 
[03:01:30]  all right three times same bad joke it's hysterical who's named lamont no one is  lamont all right so did i clear it all up yeah now i kind of uh got it finally someone's saying  read the book we fuck reading books really all queers god i read a book cody i read documentary 
[03:02:00]  books you're the last phone call okay well it's a short story it'll take you 10 minutes to read it  actually um oh really i was hoping for a nice novel because then i'm like maybe some of these  questions will be answered in the book yeah i was too i tried to sound all smart and i told people i'm  reading the curious case of benjamin button and my ex-girlfriend goes so fucking what it takes you five  minutes and it's a short story and they made it into a three-hour fucking movie yeah but anyway he's  he's got the mentality that's there up until he dies as essentially an infant spoiler alert i should 
[03:02:30]  have said that first um thank god yeah you could kind of figure it out that that's gonna happen  spoilers aren't really spoilers anymore he's there because he narrates it and at the end he says  everything all of a sudden just went white so he sounds like paradise  no it was a cum shot  like i said  right to the pupils you're actually saying his name wrong too by the way it's the curious case 
[03:03:00]  of benjamin button it's supposed to be but but it's not but it is actually  benjamin but are you making you're not making fun of the fact that i used to say but instead of put  no he's just being silly jimmy it's been bootin bootin i had to hear that during the last couple  weeks on the replay so i'm hearing this too it's pretty cool yeah so you bought you bought  yes brababa i didn't shut up that was cool nobody rocks bringing to the show um potential heart attack 
[03:03:30]  what's he bringing in oh by the way it's got to be acknowledged uh yes snatch was a great  brad pitt and there was no go fucking watch snatch can you ask that your question again i  i don't mean to tease him all right but are you gonna go watch yes okay do yourself a favor it's  a good film uh uh uh uh you know what e-rock's bringing to nothing 
[03:04:00]  it's gonna be more douche chill radio from your pals opie and anthony oh no remember the time we wanted to  this see if uh a turkey could fly oh god no  wait where's the iraq before the break yeah oh and it's steve martin yeah after the break no not that  wait wait we haven't done douche chill radio in a long time oh god look at iraq all happy 
[03:04:30]  what what did he just eat or is he eating wow i really need to diverse more all right iraq wait hold  on what let me let me speak to someone who doesn't quite understand grammar i really need to diverse  more yeah what is what does that mean did you forget the if i diversify yes okay i did i need to diverse  more or be more diverse yes either one you really are idiot or just you need to die exactly

[03:05:30]  with that argument i should have just stayed in attics wait wait wait wait a bunch of hacks wait  jimmy wait it's probably a good bit wait how uh shut up no it's probably where was this bit um this was  back in boston oh yeah this was uh many many many years ago do you have one clip just to tease  everybody it's two and a half minutes one one clip so far that well that's the whole bit yeah but we  spent three hours teasing the fucking thing uh i i just have the actual uh uh wait is that all we're 
[03:06:00]  playing is the two and a half minute bit i was gonna chop it down to smaller bites but you know  play it though let's play it inside let's do it today i'm starting to hear like remember what was  said i've never heard this and fun i'm gonna have to leave the studio no you can't i i i it's so  utterly bad no it's not but i liked how you ended the bit no don't don't spoil it do you remember our  guys do you remember the time do you remember the time we told everyone we were gonna set a uh 
[03:06:30]  a playboy no not a playboy i think i just ruined the bit fuck uh wait how did i how did we how we  were smart back then we were gonna uh let a oh shit a rabbit loose to get a carrot on the other side  of the highway oh yeah yeah that was it that actually got pita involved for our yeah yeah for our hackery all  i know is i if i'm remembering right this bit is full of bros and dudes okay let's let's hear it

[03:08:30]  there what no my health doesn't allow him try some good lines yeah i make it like you know  it's all coming back to me and i'm just remembering it's it's i haven't heard this bit in years i'll  tell you this much at the time these dummies that listened to us believed us there were authorities  involved i believe peter was involved again there were meetings yeah yeah the end doesn't justify 
[03:09:00]  the means yeah all right we're gonna do it next quick break and we got the pink panther uh audio for  jimmy cool which one's a bigger douche show a lot of i'll bet you this is good i bet you that you're  remembering this bit different all right jimmy i'm dying i i say give it a give it a chance  dance getting a communique 
[03:09:30]  some uh bad food in the fridge or something well  from you know a couple of the the parties you know yeah uh how many parties did you have  the food has been in there well i had the one party but i also had like some food delivered  at one point i don't know it just turned out where uh let's see angela's over there  and she said the the food in the fridge has taken on a life of its own 
[03:10:00]  um the milk turned into pudding says the lobster stew walked out  um and she's gonna try to get the smell of dead ass uh gone before you get home  why um yeah right i've worked hard on that dead ass smell yeah i guess the fridge is reeking  um because of the you know food can't sit in there that long it's been in there since christmas day  so uh and you know seafood things like that so probably gonna have to rip all the food out 
[03:10:30]  take it out and then uh you know get some of the maybe mexican maids or something in there to scrub  it out i feel bad i didn't notice because i didn't open the fridge there's plenty of twizzlers and  cookies in the cupboard oh i had such a sweet tooth for the holidays 
[03:11:00]  i ordered out and i got um yeah twizzlers god damn twizzlers are great oh they rule they are  tasty god stop stalling let's get back to the audio i don't like the fact that anthony's gonna talk  about twizzlers and fun snacks all you have to do is get to 11 my friend good luck getting us to play  this audio in the next 25 minutes i don't want to hear it it's it's embarrassing and i know it is  all right it's gotta be i gotta communicate he's old and short with an eight-year-old brain he is wise 
[03:11:30]  though as he gets older he gets taller but younger on the outside and older on the inside yeah the end  does that help you yeah but he gets young again yeah i know that part so the part where he's like  eight years old on the way down yeah you'd think he'd be a you know full of worldly wisdom yeah  but he's senile yeah jimmy's jumping at the pitch 24 minutes to go jimmy he wants to hear that disaster 
[03:12:00]  i bet it's i bet it's actually better than you remember it oh yeah all right let's get this over  with i bet it's a lot worse than i remember it it's uh yeah there's an there's an ongoing argument  with the fans that we're much better at any w but then like the aaf people say they were much better  at aaf and their any w stuff sucked hey let them let them remember us let them wax fantastic nice let 
[03:12:30]  them listen to the show through rose-colored hearing aids i oh the sad part of uh what you're  about to hear is you're not even going to get to hear a hint of sarcasm oh yeah which is just the  worst it's like it's not what we do you can hear the sarcasm you can hear the kenya yes you can  uh that's what that's what i hate about these old bits like oh my god will somebody make a joke 
[03:13:00]  please please oh god okay let me lock into position where's e-rock he's like the historian of the opian  anthony show i don't remember this bit something to do with like i think the new uh the new guinness  book of world records came out well according to e-rock it's the new guinness record books of world  oh he's terrible bumbling he's one of those idiots that say the guinness world book of records yes it's  the guinness world it's from the world of guinness yes it's a new planet named guinness the guinness

[03:14:30]  yeah it actually was late 1998 from this oh see you know why and and i'll tell you why  uh very early on in new york we we just had nothing nothing to work off of nothing no one  yeah we had to do something so we played a lot of our old stuff i think you guys try to get people  acclimated to us shut it we didn't no it's very good the original bit is on the cringe uh tapes  is it yes it actually made the cut well not necessarily it was it was one we were thinking oh god 
[03:15:00]  i just remember the cd that dolores took away from us at literally the last minute by the way last  minute i remember this is being awful i remember this is being so awful should we play the original  bit or should we play this uh i would play this oh shit all right there's a lot of comment on it all  right let me explain there's a lot of layers here we're at any w so this is about 10 years ago  and we're replaying a bit that we did about a year or two prior to that right oh god okay just to 
[03:15:30]  bring everyone up to speed i can't work i can't run especially jimmy i gotta cover up anthony  all right wow that's enough and thank you good night when did you guys do like the show in  different rooms with no way to communicate other than through the walls see jimmy now we could we  could throw a shitload of sarcasm at everybody i why you were screaming for a reason there's probably  i'll tell you what the reason is i had to uh make the radio audience believe that i might be 
[03:16:00]  broadcasting from a roof my friend from the roof so you'd have to yell because it's very windy up  no no he was in the studio yes i was on the roof you were just very excited for this bit wait is this  is this from any w what he just said no oh this is okay we're replaying it on anyw because you're  going to hear who's commenting about the bit who's more excited opie for this bit or you for your papa  john's delivery now when we're replaying this bit are we making fun of ourselves um please say yes

[03:18:30]  one place you want to search is in any gym in new york  you know when he's coming back look for the little water shake like in jurassic park  i could have delivered that better yeah it's all right you're on the roof you can't hear that  i should have thrown myself off come on jesus christ that guy had a better time on the roof and

[03:20:00]  very good thank you because you're on to the jurassic park music  he's eating from the tops of the trees  rock why do you make it so easy for everybody i wasn't even in here  i don't want to see you get fat again i'm on your side what are you doing giraffe's whole part  all right the bit didn't play on its own it was you guys rehashing it the sperm ball yeah  was us rehashing it no was it it was you guys talking about it on the air stopping and starting 
[03:20:30]  the sperm ball yeah when did we do that we did do it on the cbs side a while ago wow where was i  hi you were there okay was that good oh average like usual so no i can't open the studio ants on  the roof 60 feet in the air we've established he's high up and dangerous  yep  so you're on the roof huh yeah what are you like 60 feet off the ground i'd have to say yeah it's like  six stories maybe even a little more nice yeah i think 
[03:21:00]  oh my god that's cool are you you you would just stop with the it's cool what he has to say  what's wrong with you i think they'll be delivering nice like he just saw a 15th inning walk off home  run because you established that you're indeed six stories up perhaps more is appropriate  what's wrong with that you said you said uh like what were you like 60 feet in the air you 
[03:21:30]  said yeah six stories maybe a little more which maybe would be seven yeah and he was like um  yeah i don't know and uh and he probably went nice  what's wrong with that maybe a little more maybe a little more that would be seven yeah it's either six  or seven yeah it's not a little more yeah maybe you're six and you're on a milk trace i don't know  what that means maybe you brought a stepladder up with you 
[03:22:00]  oh this is so incredibly douchey man no it's not but it's not i like the enthusiasm man it's  fucking getting things cooking who's turning off the radios no one  hey this is one of the fine bits that brought us to new york absolutely what were they thinking i  don't know what the fuck was new york radio back then all right uh i backed up a little bit okay oh  by the way we've only gotten through six seconds oh really nice i thought we were 215 oh and the 
[03:22:30]  whole bits 250. yeah it's like six stories maybe even a little more no yeah i think we're gonna set  this world record bro i think we are because it's a nice warm day and i hear that things have more  lift when there's uh the air is more dense like this all right well our chicken only has to last  about 13 seconds 13 seconds okay oh no i know what you're doing oh oh jesus see that that okay jimmy  yeah yeah a little bit yeah is it getting ready to to play the sound effect of the chicken to get 
[03:23:00]  the chicken out of the cage how did you see what he was doing i had to get the chicken out of the cage  and and the chicken was a little rambunctious boy was as i recall oh fuck this is the worst  the way you're painting it my stomach hurts um the way you're painting it is that there's going to be  sound effects of a chicken being taken out of a cage like wall wall i know that couldn't be coming 
[03:23:30]  up yeah it might oh eric in virginia wow possibly more than 60 feet yeah possibly more oh god  things have more lift when there's uh the air is more dense like this all right well our chicken  only has to last about 13 seconds 13 seconds okay brian's bringing over the chicken  yeah we got to thank brian for getting us that chicken wait a minute brian was our intern by the 
[03:24:00]  way he had yeah yeah no capability of getting chickens anywhere no where was he getting a chicken  i know he got it from delroy lindo and devil's advocate  wow that a chicken came from a uh sound effects cd this is wait a minute you you had to bring your  machine up on a machine up on the roof perhaps a bit more  boo and my again boo it might have been in a production studio yes i might have not been on the 
[03:24:30]  roof why go all the way and actually have him outside so you get the ambience of the outside yeah i was  on the phone when you get the ambience of a studio this is so bad okay brian's bringing over the chicken  yeah we got to thank brian for getting us that chicken wait a minute oh here he is  that is a big ugly chicken it sounds very healthy like it might be able to fly 13 seconds it does  yeah the chicken's got a microphone on yeah they mic the chicken that's great descriptions too that's 
[03:25:00]  a big ugly chicken and then knowing nothing about chickens you say that one looks like it could fly 13  seconds there's something about the chicken before it's even come out of the cage it indicates  to you it has great flying capability it's going to lift off pretty pretty good yeah why this is good  boomer from jersey dear internet no they were not better man 
[03:25:30]  ready for more oh yeah all right we have a minute and 50 seconds to go cool  over the chicken yeah we got to thank brian for getting us that chicken wait a minute oh here he is  is that is a big ugly chicken it sounds very healthy like it might be able to fly 13 seconds it does  it's got a big wingspan too all right all right it's fat though that might not be good uh-oh it's like  been raised to i think lay eggs speaking of laying eggs

[03:34:30]  to make it sound like it's it's it's moving away but you're very enthusiastic keeping it pumped up  all right that's how it ended no no no there's more that's probably another minute  let it be acknowledged that the opian anthony show is officially in overtime mode we are officially  working for free for sirius xm satellite radio i don't want to confuse the issue with the big bosses 
[03:35:00]  at times we like to do free radio for our listeners out there as opposed to giving them  the quality radio we've just given them for the past few minutes yeah so dare i say that one day we  decide to do a little split and split out of here a little early it all works out in the end  carryover minutes carryover minutes that's right we all understand carryover minutes  i wish i wish i was that chicken why plunging plunging to my doom why i want to hear it happen 
[03:35:30]  there's so much excitement built up now yeah you really you got to know how it ends right of course  well chester's unless it's like fucking pile in full metal jacket there's no justice  chester's liver from whack bag writes when aunt left uh opie in the studio alone did they replace him  with helium 
[03:36:00]  yeah that voice wow uh howard stern checking in from the hamptons i did this bit in detroit  tell him fred oh  i have to hear more we're doing free radio though absolutely let's give them the best stuff you guys  want free radio today free radio from nothing i was like all right we'll continue what the hell  because we're good guys oh should i just keep him off i say just kick him off man all right here he goes

[03:37:00]  happened to the chicken what was he supposed to do i'm sad the chicken died i'm also envious of him  we had good intentions uh we were thinking new world record and uh chicken safe in the end dude  bcm was never better when this was happening oh it wasn't obviously i know exactly  oh wow dude dude well look come on did you did a header did a header 
[03:37:30]  stop the watch stop the stopwatch stop the watch dude uh what happened oh my god he did a header  he did a header the thing didn't even fly it went straight  oh this is horrible you can say that again at least i got that right  by the way a curiosity enthusiastic horrible i've ever heard uttered anthony  why would now anthony why would opie have the watch well you're on the roof with the chicken why 
[03:38:00]  would you give opie who can't see it the watch you you you are exactly right i didn't even think of  that little continuity problem stop the watch that you apparently have and you never yelled start  well i i guess you're going for a guinness book of world records now do you think that would have 
[03:38:30]  floated they said how did you do this well i was on the roof and he was in the other room  and i threw it and he had a stopwatch yeah but that doesn't make much sense but how could i hold  a phone a stopwatch and a chicken i don't know hey you want to do everything what's wrong with you  come on i don't know who are you talking to by the way when you said uh hold the wings somebody was  helping you on the roof already why couldn't they hold the watch that was uh brian the um the uh  intern sure yeah all right back to the audio yeah why did i have the stopwatch i don't know 
[03:39:00]  oh this is horrible dude it's flopping all over someone dude dude step on his head  of something he can't it's flopping around like oh this is disgusting how many seconds do you think  it lasted wait a second why don't you know since you had the watch why do you need him to guesstimate 
[03:39:30]  yeah wait a minute when you had a stopwatch you had the watch and i told you when to stop it and then  you said hey anthony take a guess hey don't get fucking teamed up against me no i'm not i'm saying  we're this together this sucks fucking assholes why you were good though man i you didn't say  do it enough though but it was cool yeah i would like a couple more dudes dude dude you step on his  head step on his head dude 
[03:40:00]  i guess a chicken fell six plus stories and was still flopping around and yeah yeah he was flopping  around uh so somebody that was down there because apparently there uh were you know listeners that  have gathered to see this radio stars yeah yeah yeah where do we go uh i was asking one to just  step on its head put it out of its poor little chicken misery sure yeah much like i would like  somebody to do to me right now if you could please and much like if that was a request the line would  start forming immediately oh god how did we do this well i have to hear what happened this was our show 
[03:40:30]  so the poor chicken didn't make it no no no getting ready to play what did we learn on the opie and anthony  show by the way friday chicken friday chicken of all the dramatic things i've ever heard the chicken  is being thrown off the roof opie knew he had the stopwatch nobody's smiling right 
[03:41:00]  of all the dramatic things i've ever seen goodness gracious oh that's oh no that's terrible that's  just awful oh no that's terrible it's flopping around like oh this is disgusting oh how many  seconds do you think it lasted i knew it was a flightless bird but you think it could fly a little 
[03:41:30]  dude it was no more than four seconds it went straight down amateurs like humbling  oh god oh dude well there is some good news dude dude dude bro dude dude bro what did you see  something sparked that energy i believe that was somebody stepping on the chicken's head yeah  see because you gotta react to that for the radio by going dude dude dude improv skills dude wait hold 
[03:42:00]  on my thing is this if you could rewind a little because i want to know the volume anthony's talking  to you in the phone why is he all of a sudden supposed to be communicating with people six or seven stories  below him at that same volume he's not yelling loud enough for 60 feet oh no listen to it like he  throws it but then he goes dude step on his head maybe they have radios yeah but there's a delay 
[03:42:30]  um here we go the conclusion of our our chicken bert you think it could fly a little dude it was no more  than four seconds it went straight down amateurs like tumbling oh god oh dude well there is some good  news that came out of this we do have dinner so i feel bad  we do have dinner see because i like chicken oh you're gonna eat the chicken 
[03:43:00]  i was hoping somebody ordered something i was hoping somebody delivered two bullets  he said we do have dinner there's a little improv for you a little improv a little improv wait  what's the line or a little stand-up improv for you oh god oh dude well there is some good news 
[03:43:30]  that came out of this we we do have dinner so i feel bad you do dude we'll eat it it will go to  the way okay all right well there you go there's our world record attempt at uh trying to make a  chicken fly for 13 seconds four damn seconds all right brother man i'll be right in and another  brother man what still trying to get that brother man to you know catch on yeah did it catch on 
[03:44:00]  uh i don't know maybe no um oh no is it pops to the curve no no no take that wow take this away  fatso that was brutal that was a bad one oh i found i found some uh some new tapes that i'll be  bringing in in the coming weeks what do you find what just some good ones
